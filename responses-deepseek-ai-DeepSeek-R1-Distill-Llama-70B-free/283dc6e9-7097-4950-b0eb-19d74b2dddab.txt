Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and magnetic intensities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that the electric field E is given by jA cos(ω(t - z/c)). I need to find the corresponding time-dependent magnetic intensity H in free space. The options are from A to J.

Wait, I remember that in electromagnetic waves, the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation. So if E is in the j direction (y-axis), then H must be in another perpendicular direction. Oh right, the wave is probably propagating along the z-axis since the term is (z/c). So E is in y, propagation in z, so H should be in the x direction maybe? Or wait, wait, the cross product relation from Maxwell's equations.

Maxwell's equations, right. Specifically Faraday's Law, but I think the relevant one here is the Ampère-Maxwell Law, or maybe it's curl E equals the time derivative of B. Let me get that straight.

Faraday's Law states that the curl of E is equal to -∂B/∂t. And in free space, the magnetic field B is related to H by B = μ₀ H, right? So substituting that in, curl E = -μ₀ ∂H/∂t.

Wait, but E is given here. Let me think about the form of E. It's a plane wave traveling in the z-direction. So E has a j component, which is y-direction. So the electric field is along y, varying with z and t.

For a plane wave in free space, E and H are in phase, and their ratio is the impedance of free space, which is E/H = c μ₀. Or wait, no, the ratio is E = c B, because E = c B for a plane wave in vacuum.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of Maxwell's equations. Let's model this. Suppose the wave is propagating in the +z direction. Then the electric field is in the y direction, as given, and the magnetic field should be in the x direction, since E × B must point in the direction of propagation (z). So E (y) × B (x) gives z direction. So H would be along x or negative x.

Wait wait, no, the cross product of E (y) and B (x) is in the z direction, so that's correct. So if E is along y, then B must be along x, so that E × B is along +z. So H is along x.

But wait, looking at the options, some are j, some are k (z), and some are i (x). So if H is along x, that would be the i direction.

But wait, let me think again. The wave equation for E and H in a plane wave. For a wave propagating in the +z direction, E can be in x or y, and H in y or x, respectively, but their cross product points in +z.

Wait, no. Let's get this straight. The Poynting vector S is E × H, and it gives the direction of wave propagation. So if E is in y and H is in x, then y × x is -z. Oh wait, that's a problem. Because that would mean the wave is going in the -z direction. But the given electric field has (z/c), which implies propagation in +z. So maybe I mixed up the directions.

Wait, maybe E is y and H is -x? Because then y × (-x) would be - (y × x) = - (-z) = +z. So that would make the wave propagate in +z.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just go through Maxwell's equations to find H.

Let me try that. So, E is given as E = j A cos(ω(t - z/c)). That's the electric field in the y-direction.

We can write E as E(y, t) = ŷ A cos(ω(t - z/c)).

We're in free space, so the constitutive relations are D = ε₀ E and B = μ₀ H.

Faraday's Law says ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t. Let's compute the curl of E.

Since E only varies with z and t, and the field is in y, the only non-zero component of the curl will come from the derivatives in x and z directions. Wait, no, because E is along y and depends on z. So:

The curl of E in Cartesian coordinates is:

(∂E_z/∂y - ∂E_y/∂z) î 
+ (∂E_x/∂z - ∂E_z/∂x) ĵ 
+ (∂E_y/∂x - ∂E_x/∂y) k̂.

But E_x = E_z = 0, and E_y depends only on z and t, so ∂E_y/∂x = 0.

So the curl becomes:

( - ∂E_y/∂z ) î.

Because the only term is the first component: (0 - ∂E_y/∂z) î.

So ∇ × E = - (∂E_y/∂z) î.

Now, E_y = A cos(ω(t - z/c)). So the derivative with respect to z is:

∂E_y/∂z = A * (-sin(ω(t - z/c))) * (-ω/c) )

Wait, because d/dz (t - z/c) is -1/c. So:

∂E_y/∂z = A * sin(ω(t - z/c)) * (ω / c )

Wait, no, wait: Let me compute it correctly.

E_y = A cos(ω(t - z/c)). The derivative with respect to z is:

dE_y/dz = A * (-sin(ω(t - z/c))) * ( - ω / c )

Because the derivative of cos(u) is -sin(u) * du/dz. Here, u = ω(t - z/c), so du/dz = - ω/c.

So dE_y/dz = A * (-sin(u)) * (-ω/c) ) = (A ω)/(c) sin(u).

So ∇ × E = - (A ω / c ) sin(u) î.

But according to Faraday's Law, ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t.

So,

- (A ω / c ) sin(u) î = - ∂B/∂t.

Multiply both sides by -1:

(A ω / c ) sin(u) î = ∂B/∂t.

So,

∂B/∂t = (A ω / c ) sin(ω(t - z/c )) î.

Now, integrate this with respect to time to find B.

The integral of sin(ω(t - z/c)) dt is -(1/ω) cos(ω(t - z/c )) + constant.

So,

B = ∫ ∂B/∂t dt = ∫ (A ω / c ) sin(ω(t - z/c )) dt * î.

Let me compute the integral:

∫ sin(ω(t - z/c)) dt = - (1/ω) cos(ω(t - z/c)) + C.

So,

B = (A ω / c ) * [ -1/(ω) cos(ω(t - z/c )) ] + C(t,z) ) * î.

Simplify:

B = - (A / c ) cos(ω(t - z/c )) î + C(t,z).

Now, considering that in a plane wave, the static part (C) would be zero, so:

B = - (A / c ) cos(ω(t - z/c )) î.

But wait, in Maxwell's equations, we have B = μ₀ H, so:

H = B / μ₀ = [ - (A / c ) cos(...) ] / μ₀ * î.

So H is in the i direction, but with a negative sign.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because the derivative of B with respect to t gives us the curl of E. So I might have missed a negative somewhere.

Wait, no, when I integrated, I had:

∂B/∂t = (A ω / c ) sin(u) î,

so integrating gives B = (A ω / c ) ∫ sin(u) dt.

Let me change variable to make it clearer. Let u = ω(t - z/c),

so du/dt = ω.

dt = du/ω.

So ∫ sin(u) dt = ∫ sin(u) (du/ω) ) = (1/ω) ∫ sin(u) du = -(1/ω) cos(u) + C.

So,

B = (A ω / c ) * [ -1/(ω) cos(u) + C ] î.

Simplify:

B = - (A / c ) cos(u) î + C.

So yes, B is in the negative i direction.

Thus, H = B / μ₀ = - (A) / (c μ₀) cos(ω(t - z/c )) î.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see.

Looking at the options, option B is H = (i A / (c μ₀)) cos( ... ), option G is H = - (i A/(c μ₀)) sin(... ), option I is (i A/(c μ₀)) sin(... ), option D is k direction, etc.

Wait, but according to my calculation, H is proportional to cos( ... ), and in the negative i direction.

So, H = - (i A / (c μ₀) ) cos(omega(t - z/c) )

So looking at the options, which one has H in the i direction with a negative cosine?

Looking at the options:

Option B: H = (i A/(c μ₀)) cos(...) → positive i, cos.

Option G: H = -i A/(c μ₀) sin(...) → negative i, sin.

Option I: H = i A/(c μ₀) sin(...) → positive i, sin.

Hmm, none of the options directly match what I have, which is -i times cos(...). Wait, did I make a mistake in the direction?

Wait, perhaps I got the direction because of the way the wave is propagating. Let me think again about the cross product. So E is in y, H is in negative x (i is x, so negative i is negative x), then E × H would be y × (-x) = - (y × x) = - (-z) = z, which is correct.

So H is in the negative x direction, so -i.

Wait, but looking at the options, which one has H as -i and cos.

Looking at the options:

Looking through options A to J.

Option B: H is i, cos → positive x, which would give E × H in +z if E is y and H is x. But earlier that would imply wave moving in +z direction when E is y and H is x, but then the cross product would be y × x = -z, which is opposite. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I messed up the cross product directions. Let me think again. E is in y, H is in -x.

y × (-x) = -(y × x) = - (-z) = +z. That's correct because the wave is moving in +z.

So H is along -x, which is -i.

So looking again, which option has H as -i and cos.

Looking at the options, the only one that has H in the i direction (x) is B, F, G, I, J, but none of them negative.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign during the integration.

Wait, let's go back to the integral:

We had ∂B/∂t = (A ω / c) sin(u) î.

Integrate this with respect to time to get B:

B = ∫ (A ω / c) sin(u) dt î.

u = ω(t - z/c), so when t increases, u increases, so the integral becomes:

B = (A ω / c) * [ -1/(ω) cos(u) ] + C.

So B = - (A / c) cos(u) î + C.

So H = B / μ₀ = - (A / (c μ₀)) cos(u) î.

So H is in the negative i direction, so -i.

Looking at the options, which one matches this? Let's see:

Option B: H= (i A)/(c μ0) cos(...) → positive i, cos. Not matching.

Option G: H= -i A/(c μ0) sin(...) → negative i, sin. Not matching.

Option I: H= i A/(c μ0) sin(...) → positive i, sin. Not matching.

Wait, none of the options have H as -i and cos(...). Hmm, that's odd.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Maxwell equation. Maybe it's the curl of E equals -dB/dt, but perhaps I should consider the negative sign again.

Wait, Faraday's Law: ∇ × E = - ∂B/∂t.

So when I computed ∇ × E, I had curl E = - (A ω / c) sin(u) î.

So,

- (A ω/c) sin(u) î = - ∂B/∂t.

Multiply both sides by -1:

(A ω/c) sin(u) î = ∂B/∂t.

So,

∂B/∂t = (A ω/c) sin(u) î.

So integrating this from time t=0 to t gives:

B = ∫ (A ω/c) sin(u) dt î.

As before, which gives B = - (A/c) cos(u) î + C.

So H is (B)/μ₀ = - (A/(c μ₀)) cos(u) î.

So H is in the negative i direction, with cosine dependence.

Looking at the options, the only option that has H in the i direction and a cosine is option B, but it's positive i. So perhaps I made a mistake in the direction.

Wait, could the wave be propagating in the -z direction? No, because the term is (z/c), which suggests +z. So E × H should point in +z.

Wait another thought: Maybe I got the sign wrong when integrating. Let me re-examine that.

Wait, when integrating ∂B/∂t = (A ω/c) sin(u) î.

So B(t) = integral from 0 to t of (A ω/c) sin(u) dt.

But u = ω(t' - z/c), where t' is the variable of integration.

Wait, perhaps to better handle the integration, treat z as a constant because we're taking the derivative with respect to time. So integrating sin(ω(t' - z/c)) dt' from 0 to t.

Let me make substitution: let v = ω(t' - z/c)

Then dv = ω dt'

So dt' = dv/ω.

The integral becomes ∫ sin(v) (dv/ω) ) = - (1/ω) cos(v) + C.

So evaluated from v = ω(-z/c) to v = ω(t - z/c).

Wait, no, when t'=0, v = ω(-z/c), and when t'=t, v=ω(t - z/c).

So,

∫ (from 0 to t) sin(ω(t' - z/c)) dt' = [ -1/(ω) cos(ω(t' - z/c)) ] from 0 to t.

= [ -1/ω cos(ω(t - z/c)) ) + 1/ω cos(ω(-z/c)) ) ]

But for a wave, the homogeneous solution (the constant) would be zero, so perhaps we can ignore the constant term.

So,

B = (A ω/c) * [ -1/ω ( cos(ω(t - z/c)) - cos(ω(-z/c)) ) ] î.

But cos is even, so cos(-x)=cos(x). So,

= (A ω/c) * [ -1/ω ( cos(ω(t - z/c)) - cos(ω z/c) ) ] î.

Wait, this complicates things. Maybe I should instead consider that for a traveling wave, the integration constant is zero, because we're dealing with a wave, not static fields.

So B would be proportional to - cos( ... ), as before.

So H is negative i times (A/(c μ₀)) cos(...).

Looking again at the options:

The only negative i option is G and possibly others. Let's check:

Option G: H= - (i A)/(c μ0) sin(omega(t - z/c))

So that's negative i and sine. Doesn't match.

Option B: positive i and cosine.

So none of the options match H being negative i and cosine.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of H. Let me think again about the wave's direction and the fields' orientation.

If E is in y, and the wave propagates in +z, then H must be in x or -x. The Poynting vector E × H should point in +z.

So E is y, H is x: y × x = -z → wrong direction.

E is y, H is -x: y × (-x) = +z → correct.

So H should be in -x direction, which is -i.

But the given options don't have this. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sign when integrating.

Wait, let me redo the integral.

∂B/∂t = (A ω/c) sin(u) î.

So,

B(t) = ∫ (A ω/c) sin(u) dt.

Let u = ω(t - z/c), so when t increases by dt, u increases by ω dt.

So,

∫ sin(u) dt = ∫ sin(u) (du/ω) ) = (1/ω) (-cos(u)) ) + C.

So,

B = (A ω/c) * ( -1/(ω) cos(u) ) + C.

Simplify:

B = - (A/c) cos(u) î + C.

So yes, negative i direction.

But looking back at the options, none of them have H as -i and cos. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should instead use another Maxwell equation, like Ampère's Law, but that involves the displacement current.

Wait, the electric field is E = E_y = A cos(ω(t - z/c)), ŷ direction.

In free space, the magnetic field H is related to the current and displacement current via Ampère's Law: ∇ × H = J + ∂D/∂t.

But in free space, J=0, so ∇ × H = ∂D/∂t = ε₀ ∂E/∂t.

So,

∇
