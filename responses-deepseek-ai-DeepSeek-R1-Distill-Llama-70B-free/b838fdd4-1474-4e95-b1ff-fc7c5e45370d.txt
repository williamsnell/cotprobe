Okay, so I have this question about banking, specifically about required reserves and deposit calculations. Hmm, I remember that required reserves are the amount of funds that a commercial bank must hold as reserves rather than lend out. The required reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that the bank must keep as reserves.

The question says that the required reserves are $100,000, and the required reserve ratio is 16 2/3%. I'm a bit confused about what 16 2/3% exactly is. Let me thinkâ€”16 2/3% is the same as 16.666...%, right? Because 2/3 of a percent is 0.666..., so 16.666...% altogether. 

So the formula I think I need is: Required Reserves (RR) equals the required reserve ratio (r) multiplied by Deposits (D). So in equation form, RR = r * D. 

Wait, but the question is asking for the deposits, so I need to solve for D. Rearranging the formula, D = RR / r. 

Plugging in the numbers, RR is $100,000, and r is 16 2/3%, which is 0.166666... when converted to a decimal. So D = 100,000 / (16.666666.../100)? Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Because 16 2/3% is 0.166666..., so the equation is D = RR / (r). 

Wait, no, let me think again. If the required reserve ratio is 16 2/3%, that's 16.666...% as a decimal. So yes, r is 0.166666...

So D = 100,000 / 0.166666... Let me compute that. Hmm, 0.166666... is 1/6. Because 1 divided by 6 is approximately 0.166666... So 100,000 divided by (1/6) is the same as 100,000 multiplied by 6. Because dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal.

So 100,000 * 6 is 600,000. So the deposits must be $600,000. Now looking at the options, option E is $600,000. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but I'm a little confused because sometimes I get mixed up between reserve requirements and money multiplier. Oh wait, the reserve requirement is the ratio of reserves to deposits. So yes, the calculation should be correct. Another way to think: if the reserve ratio is 1/6, then reserves are 1/6 of deposits. So deposits are 6 times reserves. 6 * 100,000 is 600,000.

To determine the deposits, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Required Reserves (RR)} = \text{Required Reserve Ratio (r)} \times \text{Deposits (D)}
\]

Rearranging for deposits:

\[
D = \frac{\text{RR}}{r}
\]

Given:
- \(\text{RR} = \$100,000\)
- \(r = 16 \frac{2}{3}\% = 0.166666\ldots\)

Substituting the values:

\[
D = \frac{100,000}{0.166666\ldots} = 100,000 \times 6 = 600,000
\]

Thus, the deposits are \$600,000, which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
