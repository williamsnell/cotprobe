Question:

A man allowed his friend to borrow a debit card to buy a computer. When the friend refused to return the card during a later conversation in a bar, the man pointed a handgun at the friend, held his finger on the trigger, and said, "Give it back!" A bystander screamed and threw a beer bottle at the man. The bottle struck the man's hand and caused the gun to discharge, killing the friend instantly. The man was convicted of murder in a jurisdiction that follows the common law of homicide. On appeal, he argues that the evidence, which essentially set out the facts above, was insufficient to support a verdict of murder. Should the man's conviction be reversed?

Options:

A: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of intentional murder.
B: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of depraved-heart murder.
C: Yes, because the evidence showed that the discharge of the gun was accidental.
D: Yes, because the man was acting in self-defense after being attacked by the bystander.
E: Yes, because the evidence showed that the man was provoked by his friend's refusal to return the debit card.
F: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of premeditated murder.
G: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of felony murder.
H: Yes, because the evidence showed that the man did not intentionally pull the trigger.
I: Yes, because the evidence showed that the man's intent was not to kill the friend, but to take property from him under a claim of right.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this criminal law question about murder. Let me start by breaking down the facts.

Alright, the scenario is that a man let his friend borrow his debit card to buy a computer. Later, when the friend wouldn't return the card, the man pulled out a handgun, pointed it at his friend, and told him to give it back. Then a bystander threw a beer bottle that hit the man's hand, causing the gun to discharge and kill the friend instantly. The man was convicted of murder under common law. He's appealing, saying the evidence wasn't enough to support a murder conviction.

So the question is whether the conviction should be reversed. The options are from A to I, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I need to remember the different types of murder under common law. Common law murder is typically categorized into degrees, but more importantly, the types include intentional murder, depraved-heart murder, and felony murder.

Intentional murder requires the specific intent to kill. Depraved-heart murder involves acting with a depraved heart, showing extreme indifference to human life, often demonstrated by reckless conduct. Felony murder applies when a death occurs during the commission of a felony, even if the death wasn't intended.

Looking at the facts, the man pointed a gun at his friend and held his finger on the trigger. So he was clearly in a situation where he was threatening the friend. Then a bystander's action caused the gun to go off. The key here is whether the man's actions meet the requirements for any form of murder.

Intentional murder would require that he intended to kill. But in this case, he didn't pull the trigger on purpose—the discharge was accidental due to the beer bottle. So maybe he didn't have the specific intent to kill. So option A, which says intentional murder, might not apply. Similarly, premeditated murder (option F) requires planning, which doesn't seem present here.

Depraved-heart murder is about reckless disregard for human life. Pointing a loaded gun at someone and having your finger on the trigger could be seen as a reckless act. If the man was acting in a way that shows a depraved heart, then that could support a conviction for depraved-heart murder. So option B might be a possibility.

What about felony murder? Felony murder usually requires that the death occurs during the commission of a felony. The underlying felony here might be the act of pointing a gun at someone, which could be considered assault. If so, the man could be guilty of felony murder. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on whether pointing a gun and threatening someone constitutes a felony. I think assault with a deadly weapon is a felony, so that could fit. So option G could be considered.

Wait, but the man's action leading to the death was the result of an accident caused by the bystander. Does that affect felony murder? Because felony murder doesn't require intent; it's about the act leading to death. So even if the shooting was accidental, if it happened during the commission of a felony, felony murder would apply. So maybe G is a possible answer.

But then, the man's argument is that the evidence was insufficient. So if the prosecution didn't prove the necessary elements for any form of murder, the conviction should be reversed.

Another angle: the man's intent when pointing the gun. He told the friend to give back the debit card. So his intent was to retrieve the card, not to kill. But holding a gun to someone and pulling the trigger (even if accidental) could show recklessness.

Wait, but the discharge was caused by the bystander. So the man didn't pull the trigger on purpose. But was he acting recklessly by pointing the gun and having his finger on the trigger in a situation where an accident could happen? That might support depraved-heart murder.

Alternatively, if the man was committing an assault (a felony), then any death during that would be felony murder, regardless of intent. So even if the shooting was accidental, the underlying felony would support the murder charge.

But wait, is pointing a gun at someone with the intent to take property a felony? Or is it robbery? Wait, the debit card was his, so he might be trying to take back his own property. Robbery involves taking property of another, so maybe that's not applicable here. Hmm, perhaps the underlying felony isn't as clear.

Wait, another thought: if the man was committing an assault, which is a felony, then any death during that would be felony murder. So even if the trigger was pulled accidentally, it's still during the commission of a felony, making it felony murder.

So which applies here? Let's look at the options again.

Option B: depraved-heart murder. So if the man acted with a depraved heart, that could be. But depraved heart requires more than just recklessness—it's acting with extreme indifference to human life.

Option G: felony murder. If the man was committing a felony (like assault with a deadly weapon), then any resulting death, even accidental, would make him guilty of felony murder.

But wait, the man's intent when pointing the gun was to retrieve his property. So perhaps the underlying felony is robbery? But robbery requires the intent to take property from another. But in this case, the debit card was the man's own property. So perhaps he's not committing robbery. Instead, he's committing assault with a deadly weapon, which is a felony.

Assault with a deadly weapon is a felony, so if he was committing that, then the accidental death during that would be felony murder. So option G could apply.

Alternatively, if the court doesn't consider the act a felony, then felony murder wouldn't apply. But I think pointing a gun at someone is a felony.

Wait, but another angle: the man could argue that he was attempting to retrieve his own property. So perhaps he has a claim of right, which might affect whether the taking was a robbery or not. But that's more about the intent for robbery, which might not be present because it's his own property.

So, back to the options. The man was holding a gun, finger on the trigger, which is a dangerous act. That could support depraved-heart murder because it's a reckless disregard for human life. So option B could be correct.

Alternatively, if the act (pointing the gun) is a felony, then it's felony murder, option G.

I'm a bit confused about whether pointing a gun and threatening someone constitutes a felony. I think in many jurisdictions, it's considered aggravated assault, which is a felony. So if that's the case, then felony murder applies, and option G would say the evidence supports a verdict of felony murder.

But wait, the man's actions led to the friend's death, but the discharge was accidental. However, for felony murder, it's enough that the death occurred during the commission of the felony, regardless of intent.

So, if pointing a gun at someone is a felony, then the man is guilty of felony murder. So option G would be correct, meaning the conviction should not be reversed.

But another possibility is depraved-heart murder. So which one applies here?

Depraved-heart murder requires acting with a depraved heart, which is a higher level of recklessness than ordinary recklessness. It's acting with a wanton indifference to human life.

Pointing a loaded gun at someone and having your finger on the trigger is an act that a reasonable person would recognize as highly dangerous. So this could show depraved-heart murder.

So both options B and G could potentially apply. But the key is which one is supported by the evidence.

Wait, the question is whether the evidence was sufficient. So the prosecution must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the man's actions meet the elements of one of the murder types.

If pointing a gun at someone is a felony (aggravated assault), then felony murder applies, and the conviction stands.

Alternatively, even if it's not a felony, the act could still show depraved heart.

But I think in common law, felony murder is a distinct theory. So if the underlying act is a felony, then regardless of intent, the murder applies.

But I'm not 100% certain whether pointing a gun in this context qualifies as a felony. If it does, then G applies. If not, then B might apply.

Wait, another point: the man's intent was to get his debit card back. So when he pointed the gun, was his intent to frighten the friend into returning the card? That might support that he didn't intend to kill, but the act was still reckless.

So, for depraved-heart murder, his mental state must be one of extreme recklessness. Pointing a loaded gun at someone could certainly qualify as depraved-heart murder.

Therefore, even if felony murder doesn't apply, depraved-heart murder would. So the evidence supports a conviction under depraved-heart murder, making option B correct.

But wait, let me check what the options say. Option B says the evidence supports depraved-heart murder. Option G says it supports felony murder.

If both could apply, but the question is whether the conviction should be reversed because the evidence was insufficient. So if the evidence supports either, the conviction stands.

Wait, but the man is arguing that the evidence was insufficient. So if the evidence supports either depraved-heart or felony murder, the conviction should not be reversed.

So the answer would be either B or G. But which is correct?

Wait, I think felony murder requires an underlying felony. If the act of pointing the gun is a felony, then G applies. If not, then B applies.

In many jurisdictions, aggravated assault (pointing a gun) is a felony. So if that's the case here, then G would be correct. But some might argue that it's not a felony, but a misdemeanor.

But at common law, I think that pointing a firearm is considered a felony. So G would apply.

Wait, but another angle: the man was trying to retrieve his own property. Could that affect whether his actions constitute a felony? For example, if he's using force to retrieve his property, is that a defense to assault?

I'm not sure, but I think that using a deadly weapon to retrieve property could still be a felony. So perhaps G applies.

Alternatively, if the court determines that the act wasn't a felony, then depraved-heart murder would be the basis.

But without knowing the exact jurisdiction's stance on whether pointing a gun is a felony, it's a bit tricky.

But considering that the common law tends to classify such acts as felonious, I think option G would apply. So the evidence supports felony murder, so the conviction stands.

Wait, but the options don't have both B and G as correct. So I have to choose between them.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, because depraved-heart murder is about the man's state of mind, and the act of pointing the gun with finger on trigger shows depraved heart. So the evidence supports that.

I think the key point is whether the man's actions were so reckless as to show a depraved heart. Pointing a loaded gun at someone is a classic example of depraved-heart murder.

So option B says the evidence supports depraved-heart murder, so the conviction should not be reversed. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but the other possibility is that the discharge was accidental, so perhaps he didn't have the requisite intent. But depraved-heart murder doesn't require intent to kill, just extreme recklessness.

So, in this case, the man's actions were reckless enough to support depraved-heart murder. So option B is correct, meaning the conviction should not be reversed.

Alternatively, if the jurisdiction doesn't recognize depraved-heart murder, but I think common law does.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is B: No, because the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of depraved-heart murder.

The question revolves around whether the evidence was sufficient to support the man's murder conviction under common law. The key facts are that the man pointed a loaded gun at his friend, held his finger on the trigger, and demanded the return of his debit card. A bystander's beer bottle struck the man's hand, causing the gun to discharge accidentally, killing the friend. The man was convicted of murder and argues on appeal that the evidence was insufficient.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Intentional Murder**  
   Intentional murder requires a specific intent to kill. However, the facts show that the gun discharged accidentally due to the bystander's action, and there is no evidence that the man intentionally pulled the trigger. Thus, this option does not apply.

2. **Option B: Depraved-Heart Murder**  
   Depraved-heart murder involves acting with extreme recklessness and indifference to human life. Pointing a loaded gun at someone and holding the finger on the trigger constitutes a highly dangerous act that demonstrates such recklessness. The evidence supports this theory, as the man's actions showed a depraved heart.

3. **Option C: Accidental Discharge**  
   While the discharge was accidental, depraved-heart murder does not require intent to kill but rather extreme recklessness. The accidental nature of the discharge does not negate the man's reckless conduct, so this option does not preclude a murder conviction.

4. **Option D: Self-Defense**  
   There is no evidence that the man was acting in self-defense. The bystander's action of throwing a beer bottle occurred after the man pointed the gun, and the man's initial actions were not defensive. This option is irrelevant.

5. **Option E: Provocation**  
   The friend's refusal to return the debit card might have provoked the man, but provocation does not justify pointing a loaded gun at someone. This does not negate the recklessness required for depraved-heart murder.

6. **Option F: Premeditated Murder**  
   Premeditation requires planning and deliberation, which are absent here. The man acted impulsively, and the killing was not premeditated. This option does not apply.

7. **Option G: Felony Murder**  
   Felony murder applies when a death occurs during the commission of a felony. Pointing a gun at someone could constitute aggravated assault, a felony. If the jurisdiction considers this a felony, then felony murder would apply. However, the analysis suggests that depraved-heart murder is the more direct and appropriate basis for the conviction.

8. **Option H: Lack of Intent to Pull the Trigger**  
   While the man did not intentionally pull the trigger, depraved-heart murder focuses on the recklessness of his actions, not whether the discharge was intentional. This option does not preclude a murder conviction.

9. **Option I: Intent to Retrieve Property**  
   The man's intent to retrieve his debit card does not negate the recklessness of pointing a loaded gun at someone. His actions still demonstrate a depraved heart, so this option does not preclude a murder conviction.

### Conclusion:  
The evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for depraved-heart murder because the man's actions—pointing a loaded gun at his friend and holding his finger on the trigger—demonstrate extreme recklessness and indifference to human life. While felony murder (Option G) could also apply if pointing a gun is considered a felony, depraved-heart murder (Option B) is the more direct and appropriate basis for the conviction. Therefore, the man's conviction should not be reversed.

**Answer: B**
