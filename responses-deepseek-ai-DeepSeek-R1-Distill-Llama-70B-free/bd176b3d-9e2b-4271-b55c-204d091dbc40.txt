Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. It's about finding the pH of a sodium acetate solution. Hmm, I remember that sodium acetate is a salt, so when it dissolves in water, it dissociates into ions. Sodium is a cation, and acetate is the anion. 

Sodium acetate comes from acetic acid, right? Acetic acid is a weak acid, so its conjugate base, acetate, must be a weak base. That means when sodium acetate dissolves in water, the acetate ions (OAc^-) will react with water in a hydrolysis reaction. The reaction should look something like OAc^- + H2O ↔ HOAc + OH^-.

Wait, the problem gives me the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of acetic acid. Oh right, that's Ka. So the given Ka is 1.8e-5. Since acetate is the conjugate base, I probably need the Kb for it. 

I remember that Kw = Ka * Kb, and Kw is 1.0e-14 at 25°C. So Kb would be Kw / Ka. Let me calculate that. 1e-14 divided by 1.8e-5. Let's see, 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 = (1/1.8) * 1e-9. 1 divided by 1.8 is approximately 0.555... So Kb is about 5.555e-10.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me do that calculation again. 1e-14 divided by 1.8e-5. Let me write it out: 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 = (1 / 1.8) * (1e-14 / 1e-5) = (0.5555...) * (1e-9) )= 5.555e-10. Yeah, that's correct.

So now, the sodium acetate solution is 0.10 M. Since sodium acetate is a strong electrolyte, it dissociates completely. So the concentration of OAc^- is 0.10 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is OAc^- + H2O ↔ HOAc + OH^-. This is a base hydrolysis, so Kb is the equilibrium constant here. The expression for Kb is [HOAc][OH^-] / [OAc^-].

Let me set up an ICE table for this. Initial concentrations: OAc^- is 0.10 M, and HOAc and OH^- are 0. So the changes would be: OAc^- decreases by x, HOAc increases by x, and OH^- increases by x.

So the Kb expression becomes (x)(x) / (0.10 - x) = 5.555e-10.

Assuming that x is much smaller than 0.10, we can approximate 0.10 - x ≈ 0.10. So the equation simplifies to x² / 0.10 ≈ 5.555e-10.

Solving for x² gives 5.555e-10 * 0.10 = 5.555e-11. So x is the square root of that, which is sqrt(5.555e-11) ≈ 7.45e-6.

So [OH^-] is approximately 7.45e-6 M. Then, pOH is -log(7.45e-6). Let me calculate that. Log(7.45e-6) is log(7.45) + log(1e-6). Log(7.45) is about 0.87, so 0.87 -6 = -5.13. So pOH is 5.13.

Wait, no, wait. Because pOH is -log[OH], so if [OH] is 7.45e-6, then pOH is about 5.13. Then pH is 14 - pOH, so 14 -5.13=8.87. Hmm, about 8.9.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should not have made that approximation. Let's see, if x is 7.45e-6, and 0.10 is much larger than x, then the assumption holds because 7.45e-6 is much less than 0.10. So the approx should be valid.

So then pH is around 8.9. Looking at the options, option A is 8.9, and option H is 9.3. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the Kb calculation. Ka for acetic acid is 1.8e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.8e-5) = (1e-14)/(1.8e-5) = (1/1.8) * 1e-9 = 0.5555e-9 = 5.555e-10. That's correct.

Then setting up the equation: x^2 / (0.10 - x) = 5.555e-10. Assuming x <<0.10, x^2 =5.555e-10 * 0.10 = 5.555e-11. x is sqrt(5.555e-11)= approx 7.45e-6. So [OH-] is 7.45e-6.

pOH is -log(7.45e-6) = let me calculate that more accurately. Log(7.45) is about 0.872. So 0.872 + 6 (since it's 7.45e-6) is 6.872. Wait, no, wait. Because log(7.45e-6) is log(7.45) + log(1e-6) = 0.872 + (-6) → 0.872 -6 = -5.128. So the negative log is 5.128. So pOH is 5.128, so pH is 14-5.128=8.872. That's 8.87, which rounds to about 8.9. So option A is 8.9.

But wait, another thought. Sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid (acetic) and a strong base (NaOH), so the solution should be basic. So the pH should be greater than 7. So 8.9 makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact quadratic equation without the approximation. Let's see, the Kb expression is x²/(0.10 - x) =5.555e-10. So x² =5.555e-10*(0.10 -x) → x² =5.555e-11 -5.555e-10 x → x² +5.555e-10 x -5.555e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a). Here, a=1, b=5.555e-10, c= -5.555e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.555e-10)^2 +4*1*(5.555e-11) = (3.08e-19) + 2.222e-10. The second term is much larger, so D ≈2.222e-10. Sqrt(D) is approx 4.71e-5.

So x = [ -5.555e-10 ±4.71e-5 ] /2. Since x must be positive, take the positive root.

So numerator is ( -5.555e-10 +4.71e-5 ) ≈ 4.71e-5 (since the 5.5e-10 is negligible). So x≈4.71e-5 /2 → approx 2.35e-5.

Wait, wait a second, that's different from my previous calculation. Wait, what's going on here.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. The equation is x² +5.555e-10 x -5.555e-11 =0. Because when moving the terms, it's x² + (5.555e-10)x -5.555e-11 =0.

So a=1, b=5.555e-10, c=-5.555e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.555e-10)^2 +4(1)(5.555e-11) = (3.08e-19) + 2.222e-10. So D ≈ 2.222e-10.

Square root of D is sqrt(2.222e-10) = approx 4.71e-5.

So x = [ -5.555e-10 +4.71e-5 ] / (2*1) → (4.71e-5 -5.555e-10) / 2 → approx (4.71e-5)/2 = 2.355e-5.

So x is about 2.355e-5 M. So [OH-] is 2.355e-5.

Wait, that's a different value than before. So pOH is -log(2.355e-5) → log(2.355) is about 0.371, so 0.371 +5 =5.371. So pOH is 5.371, so pH is 14 -5.371=8.629, which is approximately 8.63. So about 8.6.

But my initial approximation gave me 8.87. So which is correct? Hmm. So perhaps the assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.10 isn't valid. Because when x was 7.45e-6, which is 0.00745 compared to 0.10. So 0.00745 is 7.45% of 0.10. Some sources say that if x is more than 5% of the initial concentration, the approximation isn't good. So in this case, the assumption might not hold, so the exact solution is better.

Wait, wait, wait. Let's see. In the first approach, with the assumption, x was 7.45e-6, which is 7.45% of 0.1. So the 5% rule says that if x is more than 5% of the initial concentration, the approximation isn't good. So in this case, it's about 7.45%, so the approximation may not be valid. So the exact solution is better, giving x≈2.355e-5, which is about 0.02355% of 0.10? Wait, wait, 0.02355 M? No, wait. 2.355e-5 is 0.002355% of 0.10? Wait, wait, 0.10 M is 0.1, and 2.355e-5 is 0.02355 mM. Wait, 0.1 is 100 mM. So 0.02355 mM is 0.02355% of 100 mM. So that's 0.02355%, which is much less than 5% of 0.1. So perhaps the approximation is acceptable, and I made a mistake in the quadratic solution.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the setup. Let me recheck.

The equation is OAc^- + H2O ↔ HOAc + OH^-. The initial concentration is 0.10 M OAc^-. At equilibrium, [OAc^-] is 0.10 -x, [HOAc] is x, [OH^-] is x. So the Kb expression is (x)(x) / (0.10 -x) ) = 5.555e-10.

So the equation is x²/(0.10 -x) =5.555e-10. Multiply both sides by (0.10 -x):

x² =5.555e-10 * (0.10 -x) → x² =5.555e-11 -5.555e-10 x.

Bring all terms to left:

x² +5.555e-10 x -5.555e-11 =0.

Yes, that's correct.

So using the quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ]/(2a).

a=1, b=5.555e-10, c= -5.555e-11.

So discriminant D = (5.555e-10)^2 +4*1*5.555e-11 = (3.08e-19) + (2.222e-10) = approx 2.222e-10.

So sqrt(D) is sqrt(2.222e-10) = 4.71e-5.

So x = [ -5.555e-10 +4.71e-5 ] / 2 → (4.71e-5 -5.555e-10) /2 ≈ (4.71e-5)/2 → 2.355e-5.

So [OH^-]=2.355e-5 M. So pOH is -log(2.355e-5) → let's compute that.

log(2.355e-5) = log(2.355) + log(1e-5) → approx 0.371 + (-5) = -4.629. So pOH is 4.629? No, wait, pOH is -log[OH], which would be 4.629? Wait, no, wait. [OH] is 2.355e-5 M. So [OH] is 2.355e-5 → log(2.355e-5) = log(2.355) + (-5) → 0.371 -5 = -4.629. So the negative log is 4.629 → pOH=4.629.

Wait, that can't be right because 2.355e-5 is 2.355 x 1e-5 → pH would be 14 -4.629=9.371. Oh wait, no. Wait, pOH is 4.629, so pH is 14 -4.629=9.371. So pH is approximately 9.37.

Wait, but earlier when I assumed x was small, I got pH 8.87. Now, with the exact solution, I get pH around 9.37.

Hmm, this is a problem because the two methods are giving different results. Maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait another thing. Let me compute [OH^-] again from the exact solution. If x is 2.355e-5, then [OH^-]=2.355e-5 M.

So pOH = -log(2.355e-5) = let me compute this more accurately. Let me think: 2.355e-5 is 2.355 x 10^-5. The log of 2.355 is approximately 0.371. So log(2.355e-5)=0.371 -5= -4.629. So pOH is 4.629.

Then pH is 14 - pOH =14 -4.629=9.371. So pH is approximately 9.37. Looking at the options, option H is 9.3, option J is 9.7.

Wait, 9.37 is closer to 9.4, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the assumption that x is negligible is wrong, and I should have used the exact solution. Let me think again. The initial assumption gave x=7.45e-6, which is 7.45e-6 M. The 5% rule says if x is less than 5% of initial concentration, the approximation is valid. 0.1 M *5% is 0.005 M. x is 7.45e-6, which is 0.00745 M. Wait, no, 7.45e-6 is 0.000745 M, which is 0.745% of 0.1 M. So the approximation should be valid, and the exact solution shouldn't differ much. Hmm, but the two methods are giving different results. Maybe I messed up the exact solution.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more accurate approach. Let me try to compute x more precisely.

Given the equation x²/(0.10 - x) =5.555e-10. Let me not assume x is negligible.

So x² =5.555e-10 * (0.10 -x) → x² =5.555e-11 -5.555e-10 x.

Bring all to left: x² +5.555e-10 x -5.555e-11 =0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-5.555e-10 ± sqrt( (5.555e-10)^2 +4*1*(5.555e-11) ) ]/(2*1).

Compute discriminant: (5.555e-10)^2 = (5.555)^2 *1e-20 = approx 30.864e-20 → 3.0864e-19.

4ac =4*1*5.555e-11=2.222e-10.

So D=3.0864e-19 +2.222e-10 =approx 2.222e-10 (since 3e-19 is negligible compared to 2.2e-10).

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(2.222e-10)=4.712e-5.

So x = [ -5.555e-10 +4.712e-5 ] /2 → 4.712e-5 /2 =2.356e-5. So [OH^-]=2.356e-5 M.

So pOH is -log(2.356e-5) = let me compute this accurately.

Log(2.356) is approximately 0.3718.

So log(2.356e-5) =0.3718 -5 = -4.6282 → pOH=4.6282.

So pH=14-4.6282=9.3718. So pH≈9.37.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H:9.3 or option J:9.7. So 9.37 would round to 9.4, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, let me recheck Kb. Ka is given as 1.8e-5. So Kb=1e-14/(1.8e-5)= approx 5.555e-10. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. Since sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid
