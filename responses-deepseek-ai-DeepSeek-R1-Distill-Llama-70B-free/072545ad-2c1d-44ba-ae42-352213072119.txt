Question:

The State of Florida is prosecuting a former police officer for extortion of money from prostitutes. One of the State's witnesses is Sally. Sally has an adult conviction for vehicular homicide. She was charged with driving a car in a reckless manner resulting in the death of her sister, a passenger in the car. Sally pleaded nolo contendere, was adjudicated guilty and received a suspended sentence although she could have received a sentence of state imprisonment up to 5 years. At trial, evidence of this conviction is

Options:

A: inadmissible to impeach Sally because the conviction is not related to the case.
B: inadmissible to impeach Sally because her conviction is more than a year old.
C: inadmissible to impeach Sally because she is only a witness and not the criminal defendant.
D: admissible to impeach Sally because she was adjudicated guilty.
E: inadmissible to impeach Sally because she never admitted her guilt since she entered a plea of nolo contendere.
F: admissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year.
G: admissible to impeach Sally because she was involved in an illegal activity.
H: inadmissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide is not a crime of moral turpitude.
I: inadmissible to impeach Sally because she received a suspended sentence.
J: admissible to impeach Sally because she could have received a sentence of state imprisonment up to 5 years.

Okay, so I've got this evidence law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about whether a witness's prior conviction can be used to impeach her credibility. The witness, Sally, has a conviction for vehicular homicide. She pleaded nolo contendere, was adjudicated guilty, and got a suspended sentence, though she could have gotten up to five years in prison.

The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about the rules regarding impeachment of witnesses with prior convictions.

From what I remember, under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a witness can be impeached with a prior conviction if the crime is a felony or a crime of moral turpitude, and if the probative value of the conviction outweighs its prejudicial effect. Also, there's a time limit—convictions over 10 years old generally aren't admissible unless they're particularly relevant.

So, first, I need to determine if vehicular homicide is a crime that qualifies. Vehicular homicide, also known as vehicular manslaughter, is typically a felony. It involves causing death through reckless or negligent driving. Whether it's a crime of moral turpitude might be debatable. Moral turpitude usually involves intent or recklessness that society considers morally wrong. Vehicular homicide, especially when it's due to reckless driving, might qualify because it shows a disregard for human life, which could be seen as morally wrong.

Next, Sally pleaded nolo contendere. I think a nolo plea is treated the same as a guilty plea for purposes of impeachment because it's still an admission of the facts, just without admitting guilt. So, her conviction is valid for impeachment.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's inadmissible because it's not related to the case. But impeachment doesn't require the crime to be related; it's about the witness's character. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says it's inadmissible because it's more than a year old. Wait, the question doesn't say how old the conviction is. So B is irrelevant unless the conviction is over 10 years, which isn't indicated here. So B might not be correct.

Option C claims it's inadmissible because she's just a witness. But that's not right—witnesses can definitely be impeached with prior convictions under the rules. So C is incorrect.

Option D says it's admissible because she was adjudicated guilty. Well, she did plead nolo, but that still counts as a conviction. So D seems correct, but let me check other options.

Option E argues it's inadmissible because she didn't admit guilt with nolo. But I thought nolo pleas can still be used for impeachment because the court treats the conviction as valid. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: admissible because vehicular homicide carries a penalty over a year. Since it's a felony (max 5 years), this applies. So F looks correct.

Option G: admissible because she was involved in illegal activity. Well, that's true, but the rules specify it needs to be a felony or crime of moral turpitude. So G is too broad and probably incorrect.

Option H: inadmissible because vehicular homicide isn't a crime of moral turpitude. I'm not sure about this. Some jurisdictions might consider it as such, especially if it's reckless. So H could be a tricky option. If the crime isn't considered one of moral turpitude, then it wouldn't be admissible. But I'm leaning towards it being admissible either way because it's a felony.

Option I: inadmissible because she got a suspended sentence. The punishment doesn't affect admissibility as much as the nature of the crime. So I might not be correct.

Option J: admissible because she could have received up to 5 years. This ties into the felony aspect, as the maximum possible sentence determines if it's a felony. So J would be correct if the rule is based on the possible sentence.

Wait, in federal courts, a crime punishable by more than a year is a felony. So Sally's conviction, which could have been up to five years, qualifies as a felony. Therefore, under FRE 609, it would be admissible unless it's a crime of moral turpitude that's over 10 years old. Since the question doesn't mention the time, we can assume it's within the allowed period.

So, looking at the options again, F and J both seem correct. Let me think: F says it's admissible because the max penalty is over a year, which makes it a felony. J says it's admissible because she could have received up to 5 years, which also points to the same thing.

Wait, but under the rules, the actual sentence isn't as important as the maximum possible sentence. So even if she got a suspended sentence, if the crime could have resulted in over a year, it's a felony. So both F and J seem to hinge on that point.

But looking again, the options are separate. F says "vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year." That's a fact. J says "she could have received a sentence of state imprisonment up to 5 years." That's also a fact. So both options would be correct, but in the context of the question, which one is the reason for admissibility.

Wait, under FRE 609, the admissibility is based on the crime being punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year. So F is directly addressing that point, whereas J is about her possible sentence, which is part of the same consideration.

So both F and J are correct statements, but the question is looking for the reason why it's admissible. So, the correct answer should be either F or J.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The question is about whether the evidence of the conviction is admissible to impeach Sally.

So, Sally's conviction is for vehicular homicide, which is a felony because it's punishable by more than a year. Therefore, under 609, it's admissible. So F is correct because it's a felony. J is also correct because the possible sentence is over a year. Hmm, but the options are separate, so which one is the better answer.

Looking at the answer options again, F says "admissible because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year." That directly points to the rule. J says "because she could have received..." which is also a factor, but perhaps F is the more precise reason.

Alternatively, perhaps both F and J are correct, but since the options are exclusive, the correct answer is either F or J.

Wait, but I think the actual rule is that the conviction is admissible if the crime is a felony, i.e., punishable by more than a year. So F is correct because it states that the crime carries a maximum penalty over a year. J is also correct because she could have received up to five years, which is more than a year. So both F and J are correct, but the options don't allow choosing both. So which one is the correct answer in the options?

Looking back, the answer options are A-J, each with a reason. So the correct reason is that the crime is a felony, which is option F or J. Wait, but let's read the options again.

Option F: admissible because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year.

Option J: admissible because she could have received a sentence of state imprisonment up to 5 years.

So both are correct reasons, but I think the more precise reason is F because it's about the crime's maximum penalty, not the defendant's possible sentence. Because even if the defendant received a suspended sentence, the crime's maximum is what determines if it's a felony for impeachment purposes.

So the correct answer should be F.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because some sources say that the focus is on the maximum possible sentence for the crime, not the actual sentence the person received. So in Sally's case, the crime could have up to five years, so it's a felony. Therefore, F is the right answer.

But wait, the original question says Sally received a suspended sentence, but that doesn't matter for impeachment purposes. What matters is the nature of the crime. So F is correct.

So, looking at the options:

F: admissible because vehicular homicide carries a max penalty over 1 year.

J: admissible because she could have received up to 5 years.

Both are correct, but F is more about the crime's classification, which is the determining factor. J is also correct, but perhaps the answer expects F.

Wait, but I also remember that under FRE 609, the crime must be a felony, meaning it can be punished by more than a year, regardless of the actual sentence given. So Sally's conviction qualifies because the maximum is 5 years. Therefore, F is correct.

So the answer should be F.

The question revolves around whether Sally's prior conviction for vehicular homicide can be used to impeach her credibility as a witness. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a witness can be impeached with a prior conviction if the crime is a felony (punishable by more than one year in prison) or a crime of moral turpitude, and the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect.

Key points to consider:

1. **Vehicular Homicide as a Felony**: Vehicular homicide is typically classified as a felony because it carries a maximum penalty exceeding one year (in this case, up to five years). This makes it admissible for impeachment under FRE 609, regardless of the actual sentence Sally received.

2. **Nolo Contendere Plea**: Sally pleaded nolo contendere, which is treated the same as a guilty plea for impeachment purposes. The fact that she did not explicitly admit guilt does not bar the use of the conviction for impeachment.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The crime does not need to be related to the case to be admissible for impeachment.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The question does not indicate the conviction is over a year old, and the time limit for admissibility (typically 10 years) is not relevant here.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. Witnesses, not just defendants, can be impeached with prior convictions.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While Sally was adjudicated guilty, the reason for admissibility is the nature of the crime, not just the adjudication.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. A nolo contendere plea is still considered a conviction for impeachment purposes.
   - **Option F**: Correct. Vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty exceeding one year, making it a felony and admissible for impeachment.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The admissibility is based on the crime being a felony or a crime of moral turpitude, not merely illegal activity.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. Vehicular homicide, especially when involving recklessness, can be considered a crime of moral turpitude.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The suspended sentence does not affect the admissibility of the conviction.
   - **Option J**: Correct. Sally could have received a sentence of up to five years, which also supports the classification of the crime as a felony.

Both **F** and **J** are correct because they highlight the felony nature of the crime. However, **F** is more precise as it directly addresses the maximum penalty of the crime itself, which is the determining factor under FRE 609. Therefore, the best answer is:

**Answer: F**
