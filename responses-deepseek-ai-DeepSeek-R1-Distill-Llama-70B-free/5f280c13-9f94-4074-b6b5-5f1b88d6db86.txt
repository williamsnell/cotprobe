Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about.

The question says: A woman transmits color blindness to her son although she herself displays normal color vision. The defect transmitted by this woman represents a characteristic of her... and then there are several options.

Hmm, I remember that color blindness is typically a recessive trait, right? And it's usually on the X chromosome. So, since the woman has normal vision but her son is color blind, she must be a carrier.

Wait, how does that work? Oh right, women have two X chromosomes. So if a woman has one normal and one defective gene, she's a carrier but doesn't show the trait because the normal gene dominates. But when she has a son, she gives him one of her X chromosomes. If it's the defective one, the son will have color blindness because he only gets one X (from the mother) and one Y (from the father, which doesn't carry the color vision gene).

So the woman's genotype must be a carrier. That means she has one dominant and one recessive allele for the color vision gene.

Now the question is about what characteristic this represents. The options are phenotype, genotype, etc.

The woman's phenotype is normal because she shows normal color vision. The defect is in her genotype because she has the recessive gene. So the transmitted defect is part of her genotype.

Looking at the options, H is genotype, which seems correct. The other options: A is phenotype, which is incorrect because the trait isn't visible in her. B is mitochondrial DNA, which isn't related here. C is autosome, but color blindness is on the sex chromosome. D is recessive genesâ€”well, she has a recessive gene, but the question is about the characteristic it represents. So it's more about whether it's genotype or phenotype. Since she herself doesn't have the condition, it's about her genotype.

So the answer should be H: genotype.

The question involves a woman who transmits color blindness to her son despite having normal color vision herself. Color blindness is a recessive trait typically located on the X chromosome. Since the woman has normal vision, she must be a carrier, meaning her genotype includes one normal (dominant) allele and one defective (recessive) allele. She passes the defective allele to her son, who expresses the condition because he inherits only one X chromosome (from his mother) and one Y chromosome (from his father), which does not carry the color vision gene.

The defect transmitted by the woman is part of her genotype, as it represents her genetic makeup rather than her observable phenotype, which is normal. Among the options provided, the correct answer is "genotype."

Answer: H
