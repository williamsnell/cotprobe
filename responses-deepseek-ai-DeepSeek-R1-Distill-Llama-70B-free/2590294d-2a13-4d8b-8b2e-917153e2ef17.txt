Okay, so I need to figure out what "quid pro quo" means in the context of sexual harassment. I remember that quid pro quo is a Latin phrase that translates to "something for something" or "this for that." It's often used to describe a situation where someone offers something in exchange for something else, usually in a business context or negotiations.

In the context of sexual harassment, I think quid pro quo refers to when someone in a position of power, like a boss or supervisor, demands sexual favors from an employee in exchange for job-related benefits. So, it's like offering a promotion, raise, or not firing someone if they comply with sexual demands. Or maybe the opposite, where refusing such demands leads to negative job consequences, like being demoted or fired.

Looking at the options:

A: overt sexual conduct. Overt means explicit, but quid pro quo isn't just about the type of conduct, it's about the exchange.

B: exchanging sexual favors for monetary rewards. Hmm, that sounds close, but I think it's more about job-related things, not just money. Like promotions, not necessarily cash.

C: Judgment of a reasonable woman. That sounds more like the standard used to determine if behavior is offensive, not quid pro quo.

D: Reasonable man standard. Similar to C, just a different standard.

E: Employee making sexual demands to their supervisor. Wait, quid pro quo is usually the supervisor demanding from the employee, not the other way around. So E might not be correct.

F: Employee's response to non-sexual demands affecting their job. That doesn't seem right. It's about sexual demands.

G: Covert sexual conduct. Covert means hidden, but quid pro quo is more about the exchange than being hidden.

H: Hostile environment. That's another form of harassment, where the environment is made offensive, but not specifically about exchanging favors for job benefits.

I: Response to sexual demands affecting job. This sounds right. Quid pro quo involves job consequences based on whether the employee gives in to the sexual demands.

J: Making non-sexual demands for job favors. That's the opposite; quid pro quo involves sexual demands.

So the correct answer should be I. Because quid pro quo is when an employee's response (whether they agree or refuse) to sexual demands affects their job status, like getting a promotion or being fired.

The term "quid pro quo" in the context of sexual harassment refers to situations where an individual in a position of authority demands sexual favors in exchange for job-related benefits or where refusing such demands results in negative job consequences. This concept specifically involves the exchange of sexual compliance for employment decisions, such as promotions, raises, or job security.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, G**: These focus on types of sexual conduct rather than the exchange aspect central to quid pro quo.
- **C, D, H**: These relate to standards for determining offensiveness or hostile environments, not the specific exchange dynamic.
- **E, F, J**: These describe scenarios unrelated to the sexual demands-job impact exchange.
- **I**: Correctly captures the essence of quid pro quo, where an employee's response to sexual demands affects their job.

**Answer: I**
