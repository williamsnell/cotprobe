Okay, I need to figure out the best explanation of the fallacy of loaded language from the given options. Let me start by recalling what I know about loaded language. 

From what I remember, loaded language refers to using words or phrases with strong emotional connotations to influence an audience's emotions instead of their reasoning. The idea is that the language is loaded with emotion, so it sways people without them logically evaluating the argument.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one to see which fits best.

Option A talks about using complex language to seem credible. That sounds more like the appeal to authority or perhaps a red herring, not loaded language.

Option B says it's about appealing to prejudices or biases. While related, I'm not sure it's exactly loaded language. It might be more about ad hominem or appeal to emotion in a different way.

Option C mentions misleading language. That could be related to lying or deception, but loaded language is more about emotional appeal rather than outright deception.

Option D is about formal language to intimidate. That sounds like a different fallacy, maybe the appeal to authority or perhaps using jargon to confuse.

Option E is about ambiguous language leading to multiple interpretations. That might be related to ambiguity fallacies but not exactly loaded language.

Option F is about overly emotional language to distract from lack of evidence. This sounds close because loaded language is emotional, but I think it's more specific than that. Loaded language is when the words themselves carry the emotion, not just using emotional appeals.

Option G refers to vague or ambiguous language. Again, that's more about clarity than emotional connotation.

Option H is confusing figurative and literal language, which is a different issue, perhaps a metaphor mistake.

Option I says using emotionally charged language to create an impression without justifying that the language fits the subject. This seems spot on. Loaded language uses words that have strong connotations to influence opinion without providing a logical argument to support why those words apply.

Option J is about referring to the same act differently based on who does it. That sounds like the tu quoque fallacy or maybe special pleading.

So, putting it together, option I seems to capture the essence of loaded language. It's about using charged words to create an impression without logical backing.

The fallacy of loaded language occurs when emotionally charged words are used to create a specific impression about a subject without providing logical reasoning to justify why those words apply. This tactic aims to influence the audience's emotions rather than their rational evaluation of the argument.
