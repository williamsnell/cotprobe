Question:

The owner of a large unimproved tract of land leased it to a tenant for five years at a monthly rental of $1,500. The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000. "The owner initially set the asking price at $300,000. After receiving scant interest, the owner decided to reduce the price to $260,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the farm to all of the prospective buyers. Finally, 14 months after the agreement between the owner and the tenant was executed, and after rejecting offers for $240,000 and $250,000, the owner sold the tract of land for $256,000 to a buyer who visited the land while the tenant was away on vacation. Thereupon, the tenant, who had failed to pay the last two months rent as per the agreement, moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds, and the tenant brought suit to recover damages for breach of contract. Which of the following is the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit?

Options:

A: The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale.
B: The owner's decision to reduce the asking price without consulting the tenant was a breach of their agreement.
C: The agreement between the owner and the tenant was voidable because it was a restraint on alienation, since it conditioned a promise to pay for a conveyance of land upon an otherwise invalid leasehold contract.
D: The tenant failed to maintain the property in a presentable state for potential buyers, thereby breaching his responsibilities under the agreement.
E: The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance.
F: The owner had no legal obligation to share the proceeds of the sale as the tenant had continued to live on the property rent-free for a year.
G: The owner's agreement to pay the tenant was conditional upon the sale price exceeding $250,000, which it did not.
H: The tenant's decision to farm the land was against the rental agreement and hence, a violation of the contract.
I: The tenant's construction of the barn without the owner's explicit permission was a breach of the lease agreement.

Okay, I'm trying to tackle this legal question. Let me read through it carefully to understand all the details.

So, the situation involves a landlord and tenant. The landlord leased a large tract of land to the tenant for five years at $1,500 a month. The lease specified that the land was to be used as farmland. After taking possession, the tenant built a barn at his own expense, which increased the land's value from $250k to $275k. Then, toward the end of the lease, the landlord decided to sell the land. The lease expired, and they made an agreement about the sale proceeds. The agreement said the owner would pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds over $250k, but only if the tenant stayed rent-free for a year while the owner tried to sell. After that, the tenant could stay at $1,000 a month until the sale closed.

The owner initially asked $300k, but got little interest, so reduced it to $260k. This made the tenant angry, so he started badmouthing the farm to potential buyers. Eventually, the land sold for $256k 14 months later. The tenant had stopped paying the last two months' rent and moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any proceeds, and the tenant sued.

The question is about the owner's best defense against the tenant's breach of contract claim. The options are A through I.

I need to figure out which argument the owner can make to avoid paying the tenant. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Tenant breached an implied promise to cooperate or not hinder the sale. That sounds possible. The tenant was badmouthing, which could hinder sales. Implied terms often include cooperation, especially in contracts like this where the tenant's behavior affects the sale.

Option B: Owner breached by reducing the price without consulting. The agreement didn't say the owner had to consult the tenant about price changes, so maybe this isn't a strong argument.

Option C: Agreement is voidable because it's a restraint on alienation. Restraint on alienation usually refers to conditions that unreasonably restrict the ability to sell. The agreement here ties payment to the sale price, but I'm not sure it's an invalid restraint. Maybe, but not the strongest argument.

Option D: Tenant didn't maintain the property for buyers. The facts don't mention the property not being presentable, just that the tenant badmouthed. So maybe not D.

Option E: Tenant's failure to pay last two months' rent was a material breach. The agreement after the lease was a new contract. The lease had expired, so the new agreement's terms would govern. The tenant was supposed to pay $1,000 a month after the first year. If he didn't pay the last two months, that's a breach. But does that discharge the owner's duties? If so, E might be a good option.

Option F: Owner had no obligation because tenant lived rent-free for a year. Wait, the agreement allowed the tenant to stay rent-free for a year, so F doesn't seem right because that was part of the deal.

Option G: Sale price didn't exceed $250k. The sale was $256k, which is over $250k. So two-thirds of (256k - 250k) is two-thirds of 6k, which is $4k. So G is incorrect because the sale did exceed.

Option H: Farming violated the lease. The lease was for farmland, so the tenant was allowed to farm. So H is wrong.

Option I: Tenant built the barn without permission. The question says the tenant built it at his own expense, but the lease was for farmland, which might imply permission for such structures. Also, the main issue is about the sale agreement, not the original lease terms. So I might not be the best defense.

Now, considering the options, A and E and maybe E.

Option E: Tenant didn't pay the last two months. If the agreement was that after the first year, the tenant pays $1k/month, and he failed to pay, that's a breach. Whether it's material enough to discharge the owner's obligation depends. But contract law says that material breaches can discharge duties. So if the tenant failed to pay rent under the new agreement, the owner might argue that this breach justifies not paying the share.

Option A: The tenant's actions in badmouthing could be seen as a failure to cooperate. In contracts, there's an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, which includes not willfully undermining the other party's efforts. The tenant actively hindered the sale by discouraging buyers, which could be a material breach.

So which is better, A or E?

The tenant's failure to pay rent was after the sale was already agreed upon, I think. The sale closed, and the tenant moved out because he didn't pay the last two months. Maybe the non-payment is a separate breach but perhaps not directly related to the sale proceeds. The owner's duty to pay was based on the sale, and the tenant's actions during the sale process (badmouthing) might have impacted the sale price or the ability to sell, thus justifying the owner to withhold payment.

So perhaps A is a stronger argument because it's about the tenant's interference with the sale efforts, which directly affects the owner's ability to get a higher price. The tenant's actions may have prevented the owner from getting a better price, thus reducing the excess over $250k. In this case, the sale was $256k, which isn't much over. If the tenant's actions caused lower offers, that's a problem.

So the owner could argue that because the tenant hindered the sale, the owner isn't obligated to pay, as the tenant didn't hold up their end of the agreement to cooperate.

Alternatively, the tenant's breach of the payment could discharge the owner's duty, but the non-payment happened after the sale was already made. The agreement was to pay two-thirds of the excess upon sale. So perhaps the non-payment is a separate issue, but it's unclear if it directly ties to the payment from the sale.

Hmm. So perhaps A is the best option because the tenant's actions during the sale process (badmouthing) breached the implied duty to cooperate, which was a material part of the agreement. Without the tenant's cooperation, the owner couldn't achieve a higher sale price, which directly affects the payment.

So I'm leaning towards option A.

The question revolves around a dispute between a landlord and tenant regarding the tenant's right to compensation for improvements made to the property. The landlord and tenant entered into an agreement where the landlord would pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds exceeding $250,000, provided the tenant cooperated with the sale efforts. The tenant, however, engaged in behavior that hindered the sale, such as badmouthing the property to potential buyers. The landlord ultimately sold the property for $256,000 and refused to pay the tenant any share of the proceeds. The tenant then sued for breach of contract, and the question asks for the landlord's most persuasive defense.

### Analysis of Options:

- **Option A**: The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property. This is a strong argument because the tenant's actions (badmouthing the property) directly interfered with the sale process, potentially reducing the sale price and the landlord's ability to maximize proceeds. The implied duty of good faith and fair dealing in contracts includes not willfully undermining the other party's efforts, and the tenant's behavior likely violated this duty.

- **Option B**: The landlord's decision to reduce the asking price without consulting the tenant was a breach of their agreement. This is weak because the agreement did not explicitly require the landlord to consult the tenant before adjusting the price. The landlord was free to set or adjust the price as they saw fit.

- **Option C**: The agreement was voidable because it was a restraint on alienation. This is unlikely because the agreement did not unreasonably restrict the landlord's ability to sell the property; it merely tied payment to the sale price.

- **Option D**: The tenant failed to maintain the property in a presentable state for potential buyers. There is no evidence in the facts to support this claim, as the issue was the tenant's verbal discouragement, not the property's condition.

- **Option E**: The tenant's failure to pay the last two months' rent was a material breach of contract. While the tenant's non-payment could be considered a breach, it occurred after the sale was already completed. The landlord's obligation to pay the tenant was based on the sale proceeds, and the non-payment does not directly justify withholding the payment tied to the sale.

- **Option F**: The landlord had no legal obligation to share the proceeds because the tenant lived rent-free for a year. This is incorrect because the agreement explicitly allowed the tenant to live rent-free for the first year as part of the deal.

- **Option G**: The sale price did not exceed $250,000. This is factually incorrect because the property sold for $256,000, which is $6,000 over the threshold.

- **Option H**: The tenant's decision to farm the land violated the lease. The lease explicitly allowed the land to be used as farmland, so this is not a valid argument.

- **Option I**: The tenant's construction of the barn without explicit permission was a breach. The facts suggest the tenant built the barn to increase the property's value, and there is no indication that this was prohibited by the lease.

### Conclusion:

The landlord's most persuasive argument is **Option A**, as the tenant's actions in badmouthing the property to potential buyers constituted a material breach of the implied duty to cooperate in the sale process. This interference likely impacted the sale price and the landlord's ability to maximize proceeds, justifying the withholding of payment.
