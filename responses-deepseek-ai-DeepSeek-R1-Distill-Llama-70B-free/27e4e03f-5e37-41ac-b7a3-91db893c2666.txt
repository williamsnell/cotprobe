Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about economics, specifically about supply-side economics. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through.

The question is asking which option is most likely to be preferred by supply-side economists. I remember that supply-side economics focuses on production and supply rather than demand. The idea is that by encouraging production, the economy grows, which then benefits everyone. So policies that make it easier or cheaper to produce goods and services should be their thing.

Looking at the options:

A: Lower taxes on household income. That's a demand-side approach because it gives people more money to spend. But supply-siders might not prefer this as much since they focus on production incentives.

B: A tax credit on capital investment. Oh, this sounds right. Tax credits for investing in capital mean businesses can invest more in machinery, factories, etc., which increases production capacity. That's a classic supply-side policy.

C: Increased government spending. That's more of a Keynesian approach, I think. They believe that government spending boosts demand, which then drives production. But supply-siders might not agree because it could lead to higher taxes or deficits, which might not directly target production incentives.

D: Higher tariffs on imported goods. Tariffs are a form of protectionism. They can help domestic industries by making imports more expensive, but I'm not sure if this is a core supply-side policy. It might be more related to trade policy than economic growth through production incentives.

E: A tax on wealth. That would probably discourage investment because people have less wealth to invest. So supply-siders would likely oppose this.

F: Government regulation of industry. Regulations can stifle production and innovation, so supply-siders probably don't like this. They prefer a more laissez-faire approach.

G: Increased minimum wage. This could increase costs for businesses, which might reduce their willingness to hire or invest. Supply-siders might be against this as it could harm production.

H: Higher corporate tax rates. Definitely not. Higher taxes on corporations would reduce their profits and ability to invest, which goes against supply-side principles.

I: Reduction in defense spending. I'm not sure how this ties in. Defense spending is government expenditure, but reducing it doesn't directly relate to supply-side policies unless it's about reducing the budget to cut taxes elsewhere.

J: Increased social welfare programs. These are typically demand-side or part of the social safety net. Supply-siders might not prioritize these as they focus on production incentives.

So, putting it all together, option B, a tax credit on capital investment, seems like the best fit because it directly encourages businesses to invest in capital, which aligns with supply-side economics principles.

The option most likely to be preferred by supply-side economists is **B: a tax credit on capital investment**. This policy aligns with supply-side principles by incentivizing businesses to invest in capital, thereby increasing production capacity and economic growth.

Answer: B
