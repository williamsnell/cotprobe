Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about wires and beats. Hmm. Alright, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

So the problem says there are two identical wires stretched by the same tension, which is 100 N each. Each emits a note of frequency 200 cycles per second. Wait, cycles per second is hertz, right? So each wire is vibrating at 200 Hz. Now, the tension in one wire is increased by 1 N, making it 101 N. We need to find the number of beats per second when they're plucked. Beats are the interference between two frequencies, right? So the beats per second would be the difference in their frequencies.

Wait, so the formula for the frequency of a stretched string is f = (1/(2L)) * sqrt(T/μ), where T is tension, μ is linear mass density, and L is the length. Since the wires are identical, L and μ are the same for both. So initially, both have T = 100 N, so their frequencies are the same, 200 Hz.

But when one wire's tension increases to 101 N, its frequency will change. Let's call the original frequency f1 = 200 Hz. The new frequency f2 will be based on the new tension.

Let me write that formula again. f is proportional to sqrt(T/μ). Since μ and L are the same for both wires, the frequency is proportional to sqrt(T). So f2 = f1 * sqrt(T2 / T1). Because T2 is 101 N and T1 is 100 N.

So f2 = 200 Hz * sqrt(101/100). Hmm, sqrt(101/100) is approximately 1.005. Because 101 is just one more than 100, so the square root is a small increase. Let me calculate that more accurately.

Wait, sqrt(1 + x) can be approximated with a Taylor expansion for small x. So x is 0.01 here, so sqrt(1.01) ≈ 1 + 0.005. Because the expansion is sqrt(1+x) ≈ 1 + x/2 - x²/8 + ... So x is 0.01, so first term is 1 + 0.005 - (0.01)^2/8. Which is 0.00005. So approximately 1.005. So f2 ≈ 200 * 1.005 = 201 Hz.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Let me think again. Let me compute 101/100 = 1.01. The square root of 1.01. I remember that sqrt(1.01) is about 1.00498756... So more accurately, it's approximately 1.004988. So f2 = 200 * 1.004988 ≈ 200.9976 Hz. Approximately 201 Hz, but a little less. So like 201 exactly? Or maybe 200.9976, which is about 201 Hz when rounded.

But wait, the problem says to find the number of beats per second. Beats are the absolute difference between the two frequencies. So if one is 200 Hz and the other is approximately 201 Hz, then the difference is 1 Hz. So the beats per second would be 1.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me think again. The formula says f is proportional to sqrt(T). So when T increases by 1%, the frequency increases by sqrt(1.01) - 1.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(101/100) more precisely. Let's compute 101 divided by 100 is 1.01. The square root of 1.01 is approximately 1.004987562. So f2 = 200 * 1.004987562 ≈ 200.997512 Hz.

So the two frequencies are 200 Hz and approximately 200.9975 Hz. The difference is about 0.9975 Hz. So approximately 1 Hz. But wait, beats per second are the number of times the two sounds interfere per second, so it's the absolute value of the difference in their frequencies.

Wait, but why isn't the answer exactly 1 beat per second? Because 200 and 201 would give exactly 1. But in reality, the frequency isn't exactly 201. So what's the exact calculation?

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using differentials for a more precise calculation because the change in tension is small.

So, let's consider the formula f = (1/2L) * sqrt(T/μ). Let me take natural logarithms on both sides to make differentiation easier. ln(f) = (1/2) ln(T) + constants. Differentiating both sides with respect to T:

(1/f) df = (1/(2T)) dT.

So df = (f/(2T)) dT.

Given that dT is 1 N, T is 100 N, and f is 200 Hz.

So df = (200 / (2 * 100)) * 1 = (200 / 200) *1 = 1 Hz.

So the change in frequency is 1 Hz. So the original f1 is 200 Hz, the new f2 is 201 Hz. The beat frequency is |f2 - f1| = 1 Hz. So the number of beats per second is 1.

So the correct answer would be option B: 1 cycle per second.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated using the sqrt(1.01), I got approximately 0.9975 Hz as the difference. But using differentials, I get exactly 1 Hz. Which is correct?

I think using differentials is more accurate for small changes. Because the approximation sqrt(1+x) ≈ 1 + x/2 is the first term of the expansion, which is what the differential approach does. So the exact change would be about 1 Hz. So the beat frequency is 1 Hz.

So the answer should be B: 1 cycle per second.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the frequency of a stretched wire is given by:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}
\]

where \(T\) is the tension, \(\mu\) is the linear mass density, and \(L\) is the length of the wire. Since the wires are identical, \(\mu\) and \(L\) are the same for both wires, meaning the frequency is proportional to \(\sqrt{T}\).

Initially, both wires have a tension of \(T_1 = 100 \, \text{N}\) and emit the same frequency \(f_1 = 200 \, \text{Hz}\). When the tension in one wire increases to \(T_2 = 101 \, \text{N}\), the new frequency \(f_2\) can be calculated as:

\[
f_2 = f_1 \sqrt{\frac{T_2}{T_1}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
f_2 = 200 \, \text{Hz} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{101}{100}} = 200 \, \text{Hz} \cdot \sqrt{1.01}
\]

Using the approximation \(\sqrt{1.01} \approx 1.004988\), we find:

\[
f_2 \approx 200 \, \text{Hz} \cdot 1.004988 \approx 200.9975 \, \text{Hz}
\]

The beat frequency is the absolute difference between the two frequencies:

\[
\text{Beat frequency} = |f_2 - f_1| = |200.9975 \, \text{Hz} - 200 \, \text{Hz}| \approx 0.9975 \, \text{Hz}
\]

For small changes in tension, we can also use differentials to approximate the change in frequency. The relationship between the change in frequency (\(df\)) and the change in tension (\(dT\)) is:

\[
df = \frac{f}{2T} \cdot dT
\]

Substituting \(f = 200 \, \text{Hz}\), \(T = 100 \, \text{N}\), and \(dT = 1 \, \text{N}\):

\[
df = \frac{200}{2 \cdot 100} \cdot 1 = 1 \, \text{Hz}
\]

Thus, the beat frequency is approximately \(1 \, \text{Hz}\), corresponding to 1 beat per second.

The correct answer is:

**B: 1 cycle per second**
