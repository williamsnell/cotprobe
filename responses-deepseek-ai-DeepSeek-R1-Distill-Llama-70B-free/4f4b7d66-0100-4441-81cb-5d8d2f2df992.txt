Question:

A man was arrested and charged with robbery. Upon being taken into custody, he was given his Miranda rights and then taken to the police station for booking. At the stationhouse, the man told a police officer that he was prepared to make a confession. The police officer then turned on a video recorder and videotaped the man's confession. At trial, the prosecution called the police officer to testify to the incriminating statements that the man made in his confession. Upon objection by the man's attorney, the police officer's proposed testimony is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the police officer's testimony would be considered prejudiced.
B: admissible, because the man confessed voluntarily.
C: admissible, because the man was given his Miranda rights before the confession was elicited.
D: admissible, because the man was aware of his rights when he confessed.
E: inadmissible, because the man was not given an attorney during the confession.
F: inadmissible, because the videotape is the best evidence of the man's confession.
G: admissible, because the confession was videotaped.
H: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
I: admissible, because the police officer had firsthand knowledge of the confession.
J: inadmissible, because the man was under duress during the confession.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure and evidence law. The question is about the admissibility of a confession made by a man who was arrested and charged with robbery. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me read the question carefully. A man was arrested and charged with robbery. When he was taken into custody, he was given his Miranda rights. Then at the police station, he told a police officer he was ready to make a confession. The officer turned on a video recorder and taped the confession. At trial, the prosecution wants the officer to testify to the incriminating statements. The defense objects, and we need to determine if the officer's testimony is admissible.

The options are from A to J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

I remember that Miranda rights are important because they protect against self-incrimination. When someone is in custody, they must be informed of their rights before any questioning. If they aren't, any statements made can be suppressed.

In this case, the man was given Miranda rights upon being taken into custody, so that's a good sign for admissibility. Then, at the station, he voluntarily says he's prepared to confess. The officer records it on video. So the confession was made after Miranda warnings, which is a positive factor.

Now, at trial, the prosecution is calling the officer to testify about the confession. The issue is whether this testimony is admissible. The defense objects, so I need to think about what makes a statement admissible.

Wait, the officer is testifying about what the man said. That would be hearsay, right? Because it's an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. But confessions, I think, fall under an exception to the hearsay rule.

Hearsay exceptions include things like excited utterances, present sense impressions, and for confessions, perhaps under the federal rules, there's an exception for statements against interest, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, the man was in custody, given Miranda, and made the confession. So it's a custodial confession. The key here is that the officer is testifying about the confession. But if the confession was voluntary, it's admissible.

Wait, but wait. The Miranda issue aside, if the prosecution is offering the officer's testimony about the confession, that's hearsay unless an exception applies. So I need to see if the confession falls under a hearsay exception.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a confession made by a party-opponent (the defendant) is an exception to hearsay. Specifically, Rule 801(d)(2) says that a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's own statement, which would include a confession. So the officer's testimony about the defendant's confession wouldn't be barred by hearsay because it's a statement by a party-opponent.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. So the officer's testimony is about what the defendant said. The defendant's own statement, so it's an admission of a party-opponent, right? Which is non-hearsay under 801(d)(2)(A). So the testimony is admissible on those grounds.

Alternatively, the video recording might be the best evidence, but the question is about the officer's testimony, not the video. The best evidence rule applies when the contents of a writing or recording are in issue. Here, the prosecution is using the officer's testimony to recount the confession, not the video. So unless the defense is challenging the accuracy of the testimony, best evidence wouldn't make the testimony inadmissible. So option F, which says it's inadmissible because the videotape is best evidence, is probably incorrect.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says admissible because Miranda rights were given. That's a factor, but the main issue is whether the testimony is hearsay. So even if Miranda was given, if it's hearsay, it's inadmissible. But in this case, it's not hearsay because it's a party admission.

Option B says admissible because it was voluntary. If the confession was voluntary, that goes to Miranda and due process, but again, the hearsay issue is separate. Since it's a party admission, the voluntariness affects whether it's compelled, but the admissibility here is more about hearsay.

Option H says inadmissible as hearsay not within an exception. But as I thought earlier, it's a party admission, so it's not hearsay. So H is incorrect.

Option I says admissible because the officer has firsthand knowledge. That's true, but it doesn't address the hearsay issue. The officer can testify to what he heard, but if it's hearsay, it's inadmissible unless an exception applies. So I's reasoning is incomplete.

So putting it together, the correct reason is that the statement is a party admission, thus not hearsay. So the officer's testimony is admissible.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C says admissible because Miranda was given. That's correct in part because it shows the confession was voluntary, but the main point is the hearsay exception. None of the options directly state that it's a party admission, but perhaps the closest is option C.

Wait, no. The options don't explicitly mention the hearsay exception. Let me re-examine the options.

Option B: admissible because voluntary. If the confession is voluntary, it's admissible under Miranda. But that doesn't directly address the hearsay issue. So it's possible that the statement is admissible both because it's voluntary and because it's a party admission.

Wait, but the question is about why the testimony is admissible. The hearsay exception is the key here, but none of the options directly state that. So perhaps the best option is C, which points to the Miranda rights being given, implying the confession was voluntary and thus admissible.

Wait, but without Miranda, the confession could be suppressed, but in this case, Miranda was given, so the confession is admissible. So option C says it's admissible because Miranda was given. That's correct, but the alternative reasoning is about hearsay.

Alternatively, another angle: the officer's testimony is about the defendant's statements, which are admissions of a party-opponent, so they're admissible as non-hearsay. So the correct admissibility is based on that, but the options don't have that as an option. Wait, looking at the options again:

Option I says admissible because the officer had firsthand knowledge. That's about the officer's competency to testify, not about whether the statement is hearsay. So the officer can testify, but the content might still be hearsay.

Wait, but if the statement is an admission by a party-opponent, it's not hearsay, so it's admissible. So the correct reason is that it's not hearsay, but the options don't explicitly state that.

Looking at the options:

Option C: admissible because Miranda rights were given. That makes the confession voluntary, so it's admissible under the due process clause, but it doesn't speak to the hearsay issue.

Option B: admissible because voluntary. Again, same as C but without mentioning Miranda.

So the possible correct options are B, C, or I.

Wait, another angle: under the best evidence rule, when you have a recording, the original is preferred. But the question is about the officer's testimony, not the recording. So the best evidence rule doesn't apply here unless the contents of the recording are disputed. So option F is incorrect.

So, going back, the officer's testimony about the confession is admissible because the defendant's own statement is an admission, which is not hearsay. So the correct reason is that it's admissible as a party admission, making it non-hearsay. But none of the options state that. So perhaps the closest is option C, which talks about Miranda rights, ensuring the confession was voluntary. But wait, the key here is that the statement is admissible because it's a party admission, so the officer can testify to it as non-hearsay.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option I says admissible because the officer had firsthand knowledge. That's a factor in the officer being a competent witness, but the main issue is whether the statement is hearsay.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because the Miranda warning was given, making the confession admissible.

But I'm a bit confused. The fact that Miranda was given makes the confession admissible under the Fifth Amendment, but the hearsay aspect is a separate issue. However, the party admission makes it non-hearsay, so the testimony is admissible on that basis. But the options don't have that reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B: admissible because the man confessed voluntarily. If the confession is voluntary, it's admissible, but again, the hearsay issue remains unless it's a party admission.

Wait, but in this scenario, the man was in custody, given Miranda, and then made a confession. The key is that the confession is being offered by the prosecution through the officer's testimony. Since the defendant made the statement, it's a party admission, thus not hearsay. So the testimony is admissible.

Looking at the options, the correct answer would be that the testimony is admissible because the statement is a party admission, but none of the options explicitly say that. So perhaps the best option is C, because the Miranda rights were given, ensuring the confession was voluntary, making it admissible.

Alternatively, option B says it's admissible because it's voluntary, which is correct because a voluntary confession is admissible, but without considering the hearsay exception, that's only part of the story.

Wait, but the question is about the admissibility of the officer's testimony. The officer is testifying to the defendant's statements. Those statements are admissions by a party-opponent, so they are admissible as non-hearsay. Therefore, the testimony is admissible.

Looking back at the options, only option I mentions firsthand knowledge, which is about the officer's ability to testify, not the admissibility of the content. So perhaps the correct answer is B or C.

Wait, but if the statement is hearsay, but falls under an exception, then it's admissible. So the key is that it's a party admission, making it non-hearsay. Therefore, the testimony is admissible.

But none of the options state that. So perhaps the correct answer is C, because the Miranda warning was given, making the confession voluntary and admissible.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, because the confession was voluntary.

Wait, but without Miranda, a confession could be inadmissible, but here Miranda was given, so the confession is voluntary and admissible.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck, but I think the key is that the officer's testimony is admissible because the confession is a party admission, thus not hearsay. But since that's not an option, I have to choose the best possible answer among the options given.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: admissible because Miranda was given.

Option B: admissible because voluntary.

Option I: admissible because officer has firsthand knowledge.

The correct legal reason is that it's a party admission, so not hearsay. But since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is option C, because Miranda was given, implying voluntariness and admissibility.

Alternatively, another thought: the Miranda warning makes the confession admissible because it shows the man knew his rights and thus the confession is reliable. So the testimony is admissible because the man was given Miranda rights, making option C correct.

Wait, but the Miranda issue is about the right against self-incrimination. The fact that Miranda was given allows the prosecution to use the statement because it wasn't compelled. But the hearsay issue is separate, and the statement is admissible as a party admission.

In the options, the best fit seems to be option C, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, option I is about the officer's knowledge, which is a factor, but not the main issue.

Wait, another approach: the options. Let's eliminate the incorrect ones.

Option A: inadmissible because officer is prejudiced. That's not a valid reason; the officer's credibility is for the jury, not for admissibility.

Option E: inadmissible because no attorney during confession. Miranda doesn't require an attorney present; it just requires the right to an attorney. So E is incorrect.

Option F: inadmissible because video is best evidence. The best evidence rule applies when the content of the recording is at issue. Here, the testimony is about what was said, not the recording itself, so F is incorrect.

Option G: admissible because videotaped. The fact that it's recorded doesn't make it automatically admissible; it's about the content. So G is incorrect.

Option H: inadmissible as hearsay not within exception. But it is within the party admission exception, so H is incorrect.

Option J: inadmissible because under duress. There's no indication of duress in the question, so J is incorrect.

So the remaining options are B, C, and I.

Between B, C, and I.

Option I: officer has firsthand knowledge. That's correct, but it doesn't address the hearsay issue. The officer can testify to what they heard, but if the statement is hearsay, it's inadmissible unless an exception applies. So I is not the reason for admissibility.

So between B and C.

Option B: admissible because voluntary. Voluntariness makes the confession admissible under due process, overcoming a Miranda objection. But the hearsay issue is separate. However, since the statement is a party admission, it's non-hearsay, so it's admissible regardless.

Option C: admissible because Miranda was given. This ensures that the confession wasn't compelled, making it admissible under the Fifth Amendment. But again, the hearsay issue is a separate consideration, which is resolved by the party admission.

In the absence of an option addressing the hearsay exception, the best answer is either B or C.

But the question is about the admissibility of the officer's testimony. The key is that the statement is a party admission, so it's not hearsay. But since that's not an option, perhaps the next best is that the confession was voluntary, making it admissible.

Wait, but the voluntariness affects the Miranda issue, which is about the Fifth Amendment, not the hearsay rule. So the hearsay issue is a separate hurdle that must be overcome.

Since the statement is a party admission, it's admissible under 801(d)(2)(A), so the testimony is admissible. But none of the options state that.

Wait, looking again, maybe the best answer is C because without Miranda, the confession would be inadmissible, but since Miranda was given, it's admissible. However, that's more about the Fifth Amendment protection, not the hearsay rule.

But considering that the hearsay issue is resolved by the party admission, and the Miranda issue makes the confession voluntary, both factors contribute to admissibility. But the question is about which option is correct.

In the options, the correct answer is C: admissible because Miranda rights were given.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: admissible because voluntary.

Wait, but the fact that Miranda was given is what makes it voluntary. So both B and C are correct in a way, but the options are separate.

Wait, the Miranda warning being given ensures that the confession is voluntary, so C is the reason. So I think the correct answer is C.

But I'm a bit torn because the hearsay issue is crucial here. However, given the options, I think the intended answer is C.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a police officer's testimony regarding a defendant's confession. The man was arrested, given Miranda rights, and subsequently made a videotaped confession at the police station. At trial, the prosecution seeks to admit the officer's testimony about the confession, and the defense objects. The key issues are whether the confession is admissible under Miranda and whether the officer's testimony is barred by hearsay rules.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: Incorrect. The officer's testimony being "prejudiced" is not a valid reason for inadmissibility. Prejudice is a consideration for the jury, not for admissibility.

2. **Option B**: Partially correct. A voluntary confession is admissible under due process principles, but this does not address the hearsay issue. The voluntariness of the confession is ensured by the Miranda warning, but the admissibility of the officer's testimony also depends on whether the statement is hearsay.

3. **Option C**: Correct. The Miranda rights were given, ensuring the confession was voluntary and not compelled. This satisfies the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination, making the confession admissible. While this does not explicitly address the hearsay issue, the Miranda warning is a critical factor in determining voluntariness, which is central to admissibility.

4. **Option D**: Incorrect. Awareness of rights alone does not guarantee admissibility. The voluntariness of the confession and the hearsay rules must also be considered.

5. **Option E**: Incorrect. Miranda does not require an attorney to be present during the confession; it only requires the right to an attorney to be informed.

6. **Option F**: Incorrect. The best evidence rule applies when the content of a writing or recording is at issue. Here, the testimony is about what the defendant said, not the videotape itself, so the best evidence rule does not apply.

7. **Option G**: Incorrect. The fact that the confession was videotaped does not automatically make it admissible. The content of the confession and the circumstances under which it was made are the key factors.

8. **Option H**: Incorrect. The confession is not hearsay because it qualifies as a party admission under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(A). Party admissions are explicitly excluded from the definition of hearsay.

9. **Option I**: Incorrect. While the officer having firsthand knowledge makes them competent to testify, this does not address the hearsay issue or the admissibility of the confession itself.

10. **Option J**: Incorrect. There is no indication in the question that the confession was made under duress.

### Conclusion:
The officer's testimony is admissible because the confession was voluntary, as evidenced by the Miranda warning, and because the confession qualifies as a party admission, making it non-hearsay. Among the options provided, **Option C** is the best answer, as it highlights the importance of the Miranda warning in ensuring the voluntariness of the confession, which is a critical factor in its admissibility.
