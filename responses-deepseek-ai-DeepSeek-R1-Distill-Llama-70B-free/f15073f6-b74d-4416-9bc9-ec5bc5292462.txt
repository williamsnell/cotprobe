Okay, so I've got this problem here: evaluate log base 3 of 81. Hmm, logarithms can be a bit tricky, but let me think through it step by step. 

Alright, logarithms are essentially about figuring out what exponent you need to raise the base to get the given number. So, log base 3 of 81 is asking, "3 raised to what power gives me 81?" 

Wait, right, because log_b a = c means that b^c = a. So in this case, 3^c = 81. I need to find c.

Let me try to break this down. I know that 3 squared is 9, because 3*3=9. Then 3 cubed is 27, because 9*3=27. And 3 to the fourth power is 81, since 27*3=81. Oh wait, so 3^4 equals 81. That means c is 4. 

So log base 3 of 81 should be 4. Let me double-check that. If I take 3^4, that's 3*3*3*3. 3*3 is 9, times another 3 is 27, and another 3 is 81. Yep, that checks out. 

Looking back at the options, option E is 4. So the answer should be E.

The problem asks to evaluate $\log_3 81$. By definition, this means finding the exponent $c$ such that $3^c = 81$. 

Calculating step by step:
- $3^2 = 9$
- $3^3 = 27$
- $3^4 = 81$

Thus, $c = 4$. The correct answer is option E.

Answer: E
