Question:

There are only three active stations in a slotted Aloha network: A, B and C. Each station generates a frame in a time slot with the corresponding probabilities p_A=0.2, p_B=0.3 and p_C=0.4 respectively. What is the normalized throughput of the system?

Okay, so I've got this question about slotted Aloha networks. Hmm, I remember that slotted Aloha is a protocol for multiple access where nodes transmit frames in specific time slots. The key thing is that if two or more stations send a frame in the same slot, a collision happens, and those frames are lost. They then wait for a random time before retrying.

The question says there are three active stations: A, B, and C. Each has its own probability of generating a frame in a time slot. The probabilities are p_A = 0.2, p_B = 0.3, and p_C = 0.4. Theyâ€™re asking for the normalized throughput of the system.

Wait, what's normalized throughput? Oh right, in slotted Aloha, it's the average number of successful transmissions per slot, divided by the total possible. Or another way, it's the probability that exactly one station transmits in a slot, multiplied by 1 (since each successful slot contributes 1 to throughput).

So the formula for throughput (S) should be the sum over all stations of the probability that only that station transmits. Because for each station, the probability that it sends a frame and the others don't.

So for station A, the probability that A sends is p_A, and B and C don't. So that's p_A * (1 - p_B) * (1 - p_C). Similarly for B and C.

So the total throughput S would be:

S = p_A*(1-p_B)*(1-p_C) + p_B*(1-p_A)*(1-p_C) + p_C*(1-p_A)*(1-p_B)

Let me plug in the numbers. p_A is 0.2, p_B is 0.3, p_C is 0.4.

Calculating each term:

First term: 0.2 * (1 - 0.3) * (1 - 0.4) = 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.6. Let me compute that: 0.2 * 0.7 is 0.14, then 0.14 * 0.6 is 0.084.

Second term: 0.3 * (1-0.2) * (1-0.4) = 0.3 * 0.8 * 0.6. So 0.3*0.8 is 0.24, 0.24*0.6=0.144.

Third term: 0.4 * (1-0.2) * (1-0.3) = 0.4 * 0.8 * 0.7. 0.4*0.8 is 0.32, 0.32*0.7 is 0.224.

Now sum all three terms: 0.084 + 0.144 = 0.228; 0.228 + 0.224 = 0.452.

Wait, that gives S=0.452. Looking at the options, option F is 0.452. So the answer should be F.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recalculate each term.

First term:

0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14; 0.14 * 0.6 = 0.084. Correct.

Second term:

0.3 * 0.8 = 0.24; 0.24 * 0.6 = 0.144. Correct.

Third term:

0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32; 0.32 * 0.7 = 0.224. Correct.

Adding them: 0.084 + 0.144 = 0.228; 0.228 + 0.224 = 0.452. Yep, that's right. So the answer must be F.

To determine the normalized throughput of the slotted Aloha network, we calculate the probability of exactly one station transmitting in a given time slot. The formula for throughput \( S \) is:

\[
S = p_A \cdot (1 - p_B) \cdot (1 - p_C) + p_B \cdot (1 - p_A) \cdot (1 - p_C) + p_C \cdot (1 - p_A) \cdot (1 - p_B)
\]

Here, \( p_A = 0.2 \), \( p_B = 0.3 \), and \( p_C = 0.4 \). Substituting these values:

1. **First term**: \( p_A \cdot (1 - p_B) \cdot (1 - p_C) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 \cdot 0.6 = 0.084 \)  
2. **Second term**: \( p_B \cdot (1 - p_A) \cdot (1 - p_C) = 0.3 \cdot 0.8 \cdot 0.6 = 0.144 \)  
3. **Third term**: \( p_C \cdot (1 - p_A) \cdot (1 - p_B) = 0.4 \cdot 0.8 \cdot 0.7 = 0.224 \)  

Adding these terms gives:

\[
S = 0.084 + 0.144 + 0.224 = 0.452
\]

Thus, the normalized throughput of the system is \( 0.452 \). Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is **F: 0.452**.
