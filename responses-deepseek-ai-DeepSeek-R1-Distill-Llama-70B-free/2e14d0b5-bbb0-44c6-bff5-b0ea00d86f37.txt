Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: A particle's kinetic energy is changing at a rate of –6.0 J/s when its speed is 3.0 m/s. What is the magnitude of the force on the particle at this moment?

Hmm, the key terms here are kinetic energy, rate of change, and force. I remember that the rate of change of kinetic energy is related to power, which connects to force and velocity. Oh right, power equals force times velocity. But wait, I should think carefully about the exact formulas here.

So, kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv². The derivative of kinetic energy with respect to time gives the power, which is the rate at which work is done. Power (P) is also equal to force (F) multiplied by velocity (v). So, P = F * v.

Wait, but the problem gives the rate of change of kinetic energy as –6.0 J/s. So that would be d(KE)/dt, which is equal to power. But power is also F * v. So putting it together, d(KE)/dt = F * v.

Wait, but here, the rate is negative. That probably means the force is in the opposite direction to the velocity, so the work is negative, hence the kinetic energy is decreasing.

So the magnitude of the force would just be the absolute value of (d(KE)/dt) divided by the speed.

Let me write this down. The rate is -6 J/s, so the magnitude is 6 J/s. The speed is 3 m/s.

So F = (d(KE)/dt) / v → but since we're taking magnitude, F = 6 / 3 = 2 N. Wait, but wait, let me make sure.

Wait, no. Wait, Power is F · v, which is F*v*cos(theta), where theta is the angle between force and velocity. Since the rate is negative, the angle must be 180 degrees, so cos(theta) is -1. So the magnitude of F would be (|d(KE)/dt|) / v.

So F = 6.0 J/s / 3.0 m/s = 2.0 N. 

Looking back at the options, option G is 2.0 N. So that's the answer. But wait, did I mix up anything?

Wait, let me think again. The rate of change of KE is the power, which is F*v. So if KE is changing at -6 J/s, that's the power. So F = P / v. So F = (-6 J/s) / (3 m/s) = -2 N. But the question asks for the magnitude, so 2 N. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the correct answer should be G: 2.0 N.

To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the rate of change of kinetic energy (KE) is equal to power (P), which is defined as force (F) multiplied by velocity (v). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[
P = \frac{d(KE)}{dt} = F \cdot v
\]

The problem states that the rate of change of kinetic energy is \(-6.0 \, \text{J/s}\), which means the power is \(-6.0 \, \text{J/s}\). The negative sign indicates that the force is acting in the opposite direction to the velocity, but we are only asked for the magnitude of the force. The velocity is given as \(3.0 \, \text{m/s}\).

Rearranging the equation to solve for the magnitude of the force:

\[
F = \frac{|P|}{v} = \frac{6.0 \, \text{J/s}}{3.0 \, \text{m/s}} = 2.0 \, \text{N}
\]

Thus, the magnitude of the force on the particle is \(2.0 \, \text{N}\). Comparing this result to the provided options, the correct answer is:

**G: 2.0 N**
