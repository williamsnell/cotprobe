Okay, so I've got this problem about electric fields and a positively charged particle. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the electric field in the xy-plane produced by a positively charged particle is given at two different points. I need to find the x-coordinate of the particle. Hmm. Let's jot down the given information.

First, at the point (3.0 cm, 3.0 cm), the electric field is 7.2 times (4.0 i + 3.0 j) N/C. Let me compute that. 7.2 times 4 is 28.8, and 7.2 times 3 is 21.6. So the electric field there is (28.8 i + 21.6 j) N/C.

Second, at the point (2.0 cm, 0 cm), the electric field is 100 i N/C. So that's 100 in the x-direction and 0 in the y-direction.

Wait, electric fields due to point charges are radial, right? So the field at any point should point directly away from (if positive) or towards (if negative) the charge. Since the particle is positively charged, the field will point away from it.

But wait, the field is given at two different points, so I can model each as vectors pointing away from the charge's location.

Let me denote the charge's position as (x, y). Since the particle is the source of the field, the electric field at any point (a,b) would be in the direction from (x,y) to (a,b), or from (a,b) to (x,y) depending on the sign. Since it's positive, the field points away, so from (x,y) to (a,b) if (a,b) is the point where the field is measured.

Wait, no, actually, the electric field vector at a point is the direction of the force a positive test charge would feel. So if the source is positive, the field at (a,b) points away from (x,y) towards (a,b), which would be in the direction from (x,y) to (a,b). No, wait, that can't be. No, the field direction is away from positive charges. So if the source is at (x,y), then the field at (a,b) is in the direction from (x,y) to somewhere else, but wait no, the field vector is from (x,y) towards (a,b) only if the charge is negative. Because positive charges create fields that emanate outward.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The electric field direction is the direction a positive test charge would move. So if the source charge is positive, then at any point, the field points away from the source. So at point (a,b), the field vector points away from (x,y). So the vector from (x,y) to (a,b) would be (a-x, b-y). But the field points in the same direction as this vector, right? Because positive charges push away.

So the electric field E at (a,b) should be proportional to ( (a - x)i + (b - y)j ) / distance squared.

Wait, but wait, the formula for electric field due to a point charge is E = (kQ / r²) * r_hat, where r_hat is the unit vector pointing from the charge to the point. Oh wait, no, actually, if the charge is at (x,y), then the vector from the charge to the point (a,b) is (a - x, b - y). So the unit vector in that direction would be (a - x, b - y) divided by the magnitude of that vector, which is sqrt( (a-x)^2 + (b-y)^2 ). So E would be in the direction of (a-x, b-y).

Therefore, the components of E at (a,b) are proportional to (a-x) and (b-y). Wait, but the magnitude is kQ / r², where r is the distance between the charge and the point.

So, given that, the electric field vectors at the two given points should be in the direction from (x,y) to those points, scaled by 1/r².

So, first, let's handle the second point because it looks simpler. At (2.0 cm, 0 cm), the electric field is 100 i N/C. So the y-component is zero. That suggests that the direction from (x,y) to (2,0) is purely along the x-axis. Because the field is only in the i direction.

Wait, the field is pointing in the i direction. Since the source is positive, the field direction at (2,0) is away from the source. So if the field at (2,0) is along positive i, that means the source must be to the left of (2,0), because the field points away. So the source is at a point where, when you go from the source to (2,0), you move in the positive x-direction.

Alternatively, the source is at (x, y) where (2 - x) is positive, because the field is in the positive x-direction. So 2 - x must be positive, so x must be less than 2. So the source is to the left of (2,0), along the x-axis.

But wait, let's think again. The field at (2, 0) is 100 i N/C, so it's directed along positive x. That implies that the source is located to the left of (2, 0), because the field points away from the source. So if the source were at (x, y), for the field at (2,0) to be along +i, the displacement from (x,y) to (2,0) must be along +i. So (2 - x) is positive, and (0 - y) is zero. So y must be zero. Because the y-component of the field is zero, which comes from (0 - y) times some factor. So y must be zero.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the field at (2,0) is purely in the i direction. So the displacement vector from (x,y) to (2,0) must be along the i direction. Hence, y must be zero. So the source is somewhere along the x-axis.

So the source is at (x, 0), because y is zero.

That's a key point. So the charge is on the x-axis. So y = 0.

Now, let's consider the first point: (3.0 cm, 3.0 cm). The electric field there is (28.8 i + 21.6 j) N/C. Since the source is on the x-axis, the displacement from (x,0) to (3,3) is (3 - x, 3 - 0) = (3 - x, 3). The electric field should point in the direction of this vector because the source is positive.

So the electric field vector at (3,3) should have components proportional to (3 - x) and 3. But according to the given data, the electric field is (28.8, 21.6). So the ratio of the components should be (3 - x)/3.

Let me calculate the ratio of the given components. 28.8 / 21.6 = 1.333... which is 4/3.

So (3 - x)/3 = (28.8)/(21.6) = 4/3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The ratio of the components should be (3 - x) / 3. Because the x-component of the field is proportional to (3 - x), and the y-component is proportional to 3.

So (E_x)/(E_y) = (3 - x)/3 = (28.8)/(21.6) = 4/3.

So (3 - x)/3 = 4/3 → 3 - x = 4 → x = 3 - 4 = -1.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recheck. Wait, if (3 - x)/3 equals 4/3, then 3 - x = 4, so x = 3 -4 = -1. So x is -1 cm. But wait, earlier I thought that the source must be to the left of (2,0), which would be x < 2. So x=-1 cm is indeed less than 2, so that fits.

But wait, let's make sure that makes sense. Let me compute the ratio again.

E_x is 28.8, E_y is 21.6.

So 28.8 / 21.6 = 1.333..., which is 4/3.

But according to the direction, E_x / E_y = (3 - x)/3.

So (3 - x)/3 = 4/3 → 3 - x = 4 → x = -1 cm.

So the source is at (-1, 0).

But let's also check the magnitude. Because the electric field's magnitude should be consistent with the inverse square law.

Wait, the electric field at (2,0) is 100 i N/C. So the x-component is 100, and the y-component is zero, which aligns with our earlier conclusion that the source is on the x-axis.

So let's compute the distance from the source (x=-1,0) to the point (2,0). The distance is (2 - (-1)) cm along x, so 3 cm. So r = 3 cm = 0.03 m.

The electric field magnitude at (2,0) is 100 N/C. The formula is E = kQ / r². So k is 8.99e9 N m²/C².

But perhaps we can use ratios to avoid dealing with Q, since we don't know Q. Let's set up the ratio between the two points.

Wait, but maybe I should compute the magnitude of the field at (3,3). The field there is (28.8,21.6) N/C. So the magnitude is sqrt(28.8^2 + 21.6^2) = let's compute that.

28.8 squared is (approx) 829.44, and 21.6 squared is 466.56. Sum is 1296, square root is 36. So the magnitude is 36 N/C.

Wait, 28.8^2 = (28.8)^2 = let me compute 28*28=784, 0.8^2=0.64, and cross terms: 2*(28)*(0.8) = 44.8. So 28.8^2 = (28 + 0.8)^2 = 784 + 44.8 + 0.64 = 829.44. Similarly, 21.6^2: 20^2=400, 1.6^2=2.56, cross term 2*20*1.6=64. So (20+1.6)^2=400+64+2.56=466.56. Sum 829.44 +466.56=1296. Square root is 36. So yes, the magnitude is 36 N/C.

Now, the source is at (-1, 0). The distance from (-1,0) to (3,3) is sqrt( (3 - (-1))^2 + (3 - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(4^2 + 3^2 )=5 cm = 0.05 m.

So the electric field magnitude at (3,3) should be E = kQ / (0.05)^2.

Similarly, at (2,0), the distance is 3 cm = 0.03 m, and E is 100 N/C. So 100 = kQ / (0.03)^2.

So we can find Q from the second equation and plug into the first to see if E comes out as 36 N/C.

Let me compute Q from the (2,0) point.

100 = (8.99e9) * Q / (0.03)^2 → 100 = (8.99e9) * Q / 0.0009 → 100 = (8.99e9) * Q / 9e-4 → 100 = (8.99e9 / 9e-4) ) * Q.

Compute 8.99e9 / 9e-4: 8.99e9 / 0.0009 = 8.99e9 / 9e-4 = (8.99 / 9) * 1e13 → approximately 0.998 * 1e13 → ~1e13.

So 100 ≈ 1e13 * Q → Q ≈ 100 / 1e13 = 1e-11 C.

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

(0.03 m)^2 = 0.0009 m².

So 100 = (8.99e9) * Q / 0.0009 → Q = 100 * 0.0009 / 8.99e9.

Compute numerator: 100 * 0.0009 = 0.09.

So Q = 0.09 / 8.99e9 ≈ 1.001e-11 C, approximately 1.00e-11 C.

Now, let's compute E at (3,3) using this Q.

Distance is 5 cm = 0.05 m.

E = kQ / r² = (8.99e9) * (1.00e-11) / (0.05)^2.

Compute denominator: 0.05^2 = 0.0025.

So numerator: 8.99e9 * 1e-11 = 8.99e-2.

So E = (8.99e-2) / 0.0025 ≈ (0.0899) / 0.0025 ≈ 35.96 N/C, which is approximately 36 N/C, which matches our earlier calculation. So that's consistent.

So this suggests that the source is at x=-1 cm, y=0.

Looking at the options, option H is -1.0 cm. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but wait, I thought earlier that when the field at (2,0) is 100 i, the source is to the left of (2,0). So x=-1 is indeed to the left. So that makes sense.

Another check: the direction from (-1,0) to (3,3) is (4,3), so the components would be (4,3), which when normalized, would give the direction of the field. The given field at (3,3) is 28.8 i +21.6 j. Let's see if that's proportional to (4,3).

Compute 28.8 /4 =7.2, 21.6 /3=7.2. So yes, both are 7.2 times. So that's correct.

So everything checks out. The x-coordinate is -1.0 cm. So the answer is option H.

To determine the $x$-coordinate of the positively charged particle, we analyze the given electric field data at two points: $(3.0, 3.0)$ and $(2.0, 0.0)$. The electric field due to a point charge is radial and points away from the charge. The field vectors at these points provide clues about the charge's location.

### Key Observations:
1. **At $(2.0, 0.0)$**: The electric field is $100 \, \hat{\mathrm{i}} \, \mathrm{N/C}$, meaning it is entirely in the $x$-direction. Since the field points away from the charge, the charge must lie somewhere along the $x$-axis to the left of $(2.0, 0.0)$, as the field direction is positive $x$.

2. **At $(3.0, 3.0)$**: The electric field is $7.2(4.0 \, \hat{\mathrm{i}} + 3.0 \, \hat{\mathrm{j}}) \, \mathrm{N/C} = (28.8 \, \hat{\mathrm{i}} + 21.6 \, \hat{\mathrm{j}}) \, \mathrm{N/C}$. The direction of the field vector at this point is proportional to $(3.0 - x, 3.0 - y)$. Since the charge lies on the $x$-axis ($y = 0$), the field components simplify to $(3.0 - x, 3.0)$.

### Analysis:
- The ratio of the $x$- and $y$-components of the field at $(3.0, 3.0)$ is:
  \[
  \frac{E_x}{E_y} = \frac{28.8}{21.6} = \frac{4}{3}.
  \]
  This matches the ratio of the displacement components:
  \[
  \frac{3.0 - x}{3.0} = \frac{4}{3}.
  \]
  Solving for $x$:
  \[
  3.0 - x = 4.0 \implies x = -1.0.
  \]

- The magnitude of the electric field at $(3.0, 3.0)$ is consistent with the inverse square law, confirming the charge's location at $(-1.0, 0.0)$.

### Conclusion:
The $x$-coordinate of the particle is $-1.0 \, \mathrm{cm}$. This corresponds to **option H**.
