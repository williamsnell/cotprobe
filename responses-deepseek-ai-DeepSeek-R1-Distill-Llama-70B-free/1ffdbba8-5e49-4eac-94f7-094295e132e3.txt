Okay, so I've got this ratio problem here. The question is asking which of the given options are equal to the ratio 4:32. Hmm, ratios. I remember that ratios compare quantities, and equivalent ratios are those that can be simplified or scaled to match each other.

First, I should simplify 4:32 to see what the equivalent ratios look like. Let me think, 4 divided by 4 is 1, and 32 divided by 4 is 8. So the simplified form is 1:8. Wait, no, wait. 4 divided by 4 is 1, yes, and 32 divided by 4 is indeed 8. So yes, 4:32 simplifies to 1:8. Alternatively, sometimes I think of it as dividing both parts by the same number.

So, any ratio equivalent to 4:32 should also simplify down to 1:8 when divided by the same factor. Now, let's look at each option's choices and see which ones reduce to 1:8.

Let's go through each option:

Option A: 2:96 and 2:16.

First, 2:96. Let's divide both by 2. 2/2=1, 96/2=48. So 1:48. That's not 1:8. So 2:96 is 1:48. So that's not equal to 4:32. What about 2:16? Divide by 2: 1:8. Oh, that's correct. So in option A, only the second ratio (2:16) is equivalent. So option A has one correct and one incorrect. So the entire option A isn't correct because both ratios in the option need to be equal to 4:32.

Option B: 12:96 and 12:16.

First, 12:96. Let's divide by 12. 12/12=1, 96/12=8. So 1:8. That's correct. Now the second ratio, 12:16. Divide both by 4. 12/4=3, 16/4=4. So 3:4. That's not 1:8. So in option B, only the first ratio is correct. So option B isn't correct.

Option C: 2:96 and 12:16.

We've already seen 2:96 is 1:48, so no. 12:16 is 3:4, which is not 1:8. So both are wrong, so option C is incorrect.

Option D: 12:96 and 2:16.

12:96 simplifies to 1:8, which is correct. 2:16 also simplifies to 1:8, correct. So both ratios in option D are equivalent to 4:32. So option D is the correct one.

Wait, let me double-check.

12:96: 12 divides into 96 how many times? 96 divided by 12 is 8. So 12:96 is 1:8.

2:16: 2 divides into 16 eight times. So 2:16 is 1:8.

Yes, both are correct. So the correct answer is option D.

To determine which ratios are equal to 4:32, we first simplify 4:32 by dividing both terms by 4, resulting in 1:8. Any equivalent ratio must also simplify to 1:8.

**Option A:**  
- 2:96 → Divide by 2: 1:48 (not 1:8).  
- 2:16 → Divide by 2: 1:8 (correct).  
Only one ratio is correct.  

**Option B:**  
- 12:96 → Divide by 12: 1:8 (correct).  
- 12:16 → Divide by 4: 3:4 (not 1:8).  
Only one ratio is correct.  

**Option C:**  
- 2:96 → Divide by 2: 1:48 (not 1:8).  
- 12:16 → Divide by 4: 3:4 (not 1:8).  
Both ratios are incorrect.  

**Option D:**  
- 12:96 → Divide by 12: 1:8 (correct).  
- 2:16 → Divide by 2: 1:8 (correct).  
Both ratios are correct.  

Thus, the correct answer is **D**.
