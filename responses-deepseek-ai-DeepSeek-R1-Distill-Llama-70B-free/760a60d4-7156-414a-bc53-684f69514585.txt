Question:

The number pattern follows a skip-counting rule. 5, 20, 35, 50, 65... Which number pattern follows the same rule?

Options:

A: 13, 18, 23, 28, 33...
B: 5, 20, 25, 30, 35...
C: 12, 27, 42, 57, 72...

Okay, so I've got this math problem here about number patterns. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says the pattern follows a skip-counting rule, and the example given is 5, 20, 35, 50, 65... I need to find which of the options A, B, or C follows the same rule.

First, I should understand what skip-counting means. From what I remember, skip-counting is when you add a constant number each time, but you're skipping some numbers in between. Like, for example, counting by 2s is 2,4,6,8... but if you skip-count by 5s, it's 5,10,15,20... So the difference between each number is the same each time.

Looking at the given sequence: 5, 20, 35, 50, 65. Let me find the differences between consecutive numbers. 

20 -5 =15
35-20=15
50-35=15
65-50=15

Oh, so the difference is 15 each time. That makes sense. So the rule here is starting at 5 and adding 15 each step. 

Now, I need to check each option to see which one follows the same rule, meaning each step increases by 15.

Let's look at the options:

Option A: 13, 18, 23, 28, 33...
Calculating the differences:
18-13=5
23-18=5
28-23=5
33-28=5
So the common difference here is 5. That's much smaller than 15, so this doesn't match.

Option B: 5, 20, 25, 30, 35...
Differences:
20-5=15
25-20=5? Wait, that's only 5. Then 30-25=5, and 35-30=5. Oh, so the first step is 15, but then it's adding 5 each time. That doesn't fit the same pattern as the original, which consistently adds 15 each time. So option B isn't correct either.

Option C: 12, 27, 42, 57, 72...
Calculating the differences:
27-12=15
42-27=15
57-42=15
72-57=15
Ah, so each step is adding 15. That's exactly the same as the original pattern. So option C fits the rule.

Wait, but let me double-check. The original starts at 5 and adds 15 each time. Option C starts at 12 and adds 15 each time. So yes, same rule, just starting from a different number. The question is about the same skip-counting rule, which focuses on the common difference, not the starting point. So the correct answer should be option C.

The given pattern is 5, 20, 35, 50, 65..., where each step increases by 15. This is confirmed by calculating the differences between consecutive numbers:

- 20 - 5 = 15  
- 35 - 20 = 15  
- 50 - 35 = 15  
- 65 - 50 = 15  

The task is to identify which of the options follows the same rule of adding 15 each time.  

**Option A:** 13, 18, 23, 28, 33...  
Differences:  
- 18 - 13 = 5  
- 23 - 18 = 5  
- 28 - 23 = 5  
- 33 - 28 = 5  

The common difference is 5, not 15. This does not match the rule.  

**Option B:** 5, 20, 25, 30, 35...  
Differences:  
- 20 - 5 = 15  
- 25 - 20 = 5  
- 30 - 25 = 5  
- 35 - 30 = 5  

The first step adds 15, but subsequent steps add 5. This does not consistently follow the rule of adding 15.  

**Option C:** 12, 27, 42, 57, 72...  
Differences:  
- 27 - 12 = 15  
- 42 - 27 = 15  
- 57 - 42 = 15  
- 72 - 57 = 15  

The common difference is 15, matching the rule exactly.  

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.
