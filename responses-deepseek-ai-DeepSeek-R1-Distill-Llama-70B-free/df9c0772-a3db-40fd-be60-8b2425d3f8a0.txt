Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how Hobbes describes felicity. I remember that Hobbes was a philosopher, probably from the 17th century, right? His ideas were about human nature and society. I think he wrote Leviathan, which is about the social contract and the state of nature.

Wait, the question is about felicity. Felicity usually means happiness or contentment. But how did Hobbes specifically define it? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think about his view of human nature. He believed that humans are driven by their desires and aversions, and that life is a constant pursuit of power to achieve their desires.

Oh right, he talked about the state of nature being a war of all against all, but that's more about society. How does that tie into felicity? Maybe felicity isn't a state of being without desire, because Hobbes didn't think humans could be without desires. Instead, it's more about the process of achieving desires.

I recall something about a "continual progress." So, maybe felicity isn't a static state but rather a dynamic process. Like, you achieve one desire, which leads to another, so it's a continuous movement from one desire to the next. So, it's not about being satisfied and stopping, but always moving forward.

Looking at the options: Option G says "a continual progress of desire from one object to another." That sounds right. Because Hobbes saw life as a constant striving, not reaching a final state of satisfaction. So, felicity would be this ongoing pursuit rather than a state of contentment.

Other options don't fit as well. Option E is about being satisfied with one's state, which doesn't align with Hobbes' view of constant striving. Option C is about change, but it's more about desire progression. Option I is tranquility, which seems more like Epicurus or someone else. Option F is fulfilling all desires, which isn't possible according to Hobbes because new desires always arise.

So, the correct answer should be G.

Hobbes describes felicity as a state of continual progress, where individuals move from one desire to another, never reaching a static state of satisfaction. This aligns with his view of human nature as driven by constant striving and the pursuit of power to achieve desires. The correct answer is:

G: a continual progress of desire from one object to another.

Answer: G
