Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure, specifically dealing with the admissibility of a statement made by a juvenile. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

The scenario is about a 14-year-old girl who took a candy bar without paying and was confronted by a security guard outside the store. She cried and said she was hungry because she hadn't eaten lunch. Now, in juvenile court, the guard wants to testify about her statement, but her attorney objects. The question is about why her statement should be admitted.

I remember that when it comes to statements made by suspects, especially in criminal cases, the Fifth Amendment comes into play. The Miranda warnings are a big part of that. Miranda v. Arizona established that suspects must be informed of their right to remain silent and their right to an attorney, and that anything they say can be used against them in court. But these warnings are typically required when a person is in custody and being interrogated.

Wait, so in this case, the girl was grabbed by the security guard, who accused her of stealing. She was outside the store, not in a police station. Also, the guard is a private security officer, not a government employee. Oh, right! Because Miranda applies to government actors, not private citizens. So even if the guard was acting like a cop, if he's not a government employee, Miranda doesn't apply.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option J says the security guard wasn't employed by a government agency. That seems relevant because if he's a private citizen, the Miranda requirements don't apply. So her statement wouldn't be suppressed under Miranda.

But wait, could there be another angle? Like, was she in custody? If she's not in custody, Miranda doesn't apply either. But was she effectively under arrest when he grabbed her arm? That's a bit tricky. If a reasonable person would feel free to leave, then it's not custody. But being grabbed by someone accusing her of theft might make her feel she's not free to go. But the guard is private, so maybe the custody determination is different.

Alternatively, the fact that she was just accused and made a voluntary statement might mean it's admissible. But the key issue here is whether Miranda applies, and since the guard isn't a government agent, it's a strong reason.

So the strongest reason for admitting the statement would be that Miranda warnings aren't required because the questioner isn't a government employee. So the answer should be J.

The strongest reason for admitting the girl's statement is that the security guard was not employed by a government agency, meaning Miranda warnings were not required.
