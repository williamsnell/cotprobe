Question:

Describe the function of the lateral-line system in fishes.

Options:

A: The lateral-line system in fishes helps with the digestion of food.
B: The lateral-line system in fishes is used for excreting waste materials.
C: The lateral-line system in fishes is involved in the secretion of hormones.
D: The lateral-line system in fishes is used for breathing.
E: The lateral-line system in fishes is used for vision.
F: The lateral-line system in fishes functions to absorb oxygen directly from the water.
G: The lateral-line system in fishes functions in the detection of sound and acceleration, enables the fish to detect localized as well as distant water disturbances, and functions as an organ of equilibrium.
H: The lateral-line system in fishes is primarily for attracting mates during the breeding season.
I: The lateral-line system in fishes is used for reproduction.
J: The lateral-line system in fishes is used for thermoregulation.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about the lateral-line system in fishes. I remember from my biology class that fish have various systems that help them survive in water. The question is asking specifically about the function of the lateral-line system.

So, first, I need to recall what the lateral-line system does. I think it's related to sensing their environment. I remember the term "mechanoreception," which is the ability to detect movement and vibrations. So maybe it's something to do with detecting water movements around the fish.

Wait, the options are from A to J. Let me look through them. Option A says digestion of food, which doesn't sound right. B is excreting waste, no. C is about hormones, probably not. D is breathing, which is more about gills. E is vision, which is the eyes' job. F is absorbing oxygen, again gills. G says detection of sound, acceleration, and equilibrium. That rings a bell. H is attracting matesâ€”maybe that's more for certain behaviors or pheromones. I is reproduction, which is broader. J is thermoregulation, which I don't think is related.

So, putting it together, the lateral-line system helps fish detect vibrations in the water, which helps them sense prey, predators, and navigate. It's also involved in balance and equilibrium, which is part of the inner ear in humans. So option G seems to cover all that: detection of sound and acceleration, localized and distant disturbances, and equilibrium.

I think that's the correct answer because the lateral-line system allows fish to feel the water around them, helping in avoiding predators and finding food, and maintaining balance without eyesight in murky waters.

The lateral-line system in fishes functions in the detection of sound and acceleration, enabling the fish to detect localized as well as distant water disturbances, and it also serves as an organ of equilibrium.

Answer: G
