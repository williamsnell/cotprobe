Okay, so I need to figure out which value of c in Z_3 makes the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x^3 + c x^2 + 1) a field. Hmm, I remember that for a ring of the form F[x]/(p(x)) to be a field, the polynomial p(x) must be irreducible over the field F. So in this case, F is Z_3, which is the finite field with 3 elements.

So the problem boils down to finding c in Z_3 such that the polynomial x³ + c x² + 1 is irreducible over Z_3. Wait, but Z_3 means the coefficients are modulo 3, right? So c can be 0, 1, or 2 because those are the elements of Z_3. Wait, but looking at the options, some are negative numbers but since we're in Z_3, I think they're equivalent to positive numbers modulo 3. Like -1 is 2 mod 3, -2 is 1 mod 3, etc. So I need to check for each possible c in Z_3 whether the polynomial is irreducible.

But let me think: to check if a polynomial is irreducible, I can check if it has no roots in Z_3, because if it's a cubic and has no roots, then it's irreducible because it can't factor into a linear term and a quadratic. Or wait, is that always the case? Oh right, over a field, a cubic polynomial is irreducible if it has no roots because then it can't have a linear factor, so the only possible factors would be a quadratic and a linear, but since it has no root, it can't be factored further. So yeah, checking for roots is sufficient for cubics.

Wait, but wait another thing: another way is that if the polynomial has no roots, then it's irreducible. So I can test each possible c (0,1,2) and see if x³ + c x² +1 has any roots in Z_3.

So let's list all possible c values in Z_3: c can be 0, 1, 2. Because Z_3 has elements {0,1,2}.

Wait, but the options given are more than that. Let me check the options again. The options are A:4 (which is 1 mod3), B:-1 (2 mod3), C:0, D:1, E:-3 (0 mod3), F:6 (0 mod3), G:5 (2 mod3), H:-2 (1 mod3), I:2, J:3 (0 mod3). So the possible c values are 0,1,2 in Z_3. So the possible c's are 0,1,2. So the options are covering all possibilities.

So for each c in {0,1,2}, I need to check if x³ + c x² +1 has any roots in Z_3. If it doesn't, then the polynomial is irreducible, and the quotient ring is a field.

Let's make a table.

First, c=0: the polynomial is x³ + 0x² +1 = x³ +1.

So let's plug in x=0: 0 +1=1 ≠0.

x=1: 1 +1=2 ≠0.

x=2: 8 mod3 is 2, so 2 +1=3 mod3=0. Oh wait, so when c=0, x=2 is a root. So the polynomial factors as (x-2)(quadratic). So it's reducible, so the quotient ring isn't a field.

So c=0 is out.

Next, c=1: polynomial is x³ +x² +1.

Check x=0: 0 +0 +1=1≠0.

x=1: 1 +1 +1=3 mod3=0. So x=1 is a root. So the polynomial factors, so it's reducible. So c=1 is out.

Wait, so that leaves c=2. Let's check that.

c=2: polynomial is x³ + 2x² +1.

Check x=0: 0 +0 +1=1≠0.

x=1: 1 + 2 +1=4 mod3=1≠0.

x=2: 8 + 8 +1=17 mod3. 17/3 is 5*3=15, 17-15=2, so 2 mod3. So 2≠0. So none of the elements in Z_3 are roots. So the polynomial x³ +2x² +1 has no roots in Z_3, so it's irreducible. Therefore, the quotient ring is a field.

Wait, but wait another thing: could it factor into a product of three linear terms? But since it's cubic, if it had a root, it would factor into (x-a)(quadratic). But since it has no roots, it can't factor into a linear times quadratic. So it's either irreducible or factors into three linears, but since it doesn't have a root, it's irreducible. So yes, c=2 is the correct value.

Looking back at the options, the possible c values are 0,1,2 in Z_3, which correspond to options C, D, I (since I is 2). So the answer should be c=2, which is option I.

To determine the values of \( c \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) such that \( \mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) \) is a field, we need to check if the polynomial \( x^3 + cx^2 + 1 \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \). A polynomial of degree 3 is irreducible over a field if and only if it has no roots in that field. 

### Step 1: Possible values of \( c \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)
The elements of \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) are \( \{0, 1, 2\} \). Therefore, \( c \) can take the values 0, 1, or 2.

### Step 2: Check each value of \( c \)
1. **For \( c = 0 \):**  
   The polynomial is \( x^3 + 1 \).  
   - \( x = 0 \): \( 0^3 + 1 = 1 \neq 0 \)  
   - \( x = 1 \): \( 1^3 + 1 = 2 \neq 0 \)  
   - \( x = 2 \): \( 2^3 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \)  
   Since \( x = 2 \) is a root, the polynomial is reducible. Thus, \( c = 0 \) is not valid.

2. **For \( c = 1 \):**  
   The polynomial is \( x^3 + x^2 + 1 \).  
   - \( x = 0 \): \( 0^3 + 0^2 + 1 = 1 \neq 0 \)  
   - \( x = 1 \): \( 1^3 + 1^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \)  
   - \( x = 2 \): \( 2^3 + 2^2 + 1 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 \equiv 1 \mod 3 \neq 0 \)  
   Since \( x = 1 \) is a root, the polynomial is reducible. Thus, \( c = 1 \) is not valid.

3. **For \( c = 2 \):**  
   The polynomial is \( x^3 + 2x^2 + 1 \).  
   - \( x = 0 \): \( 0^3 + 2(0)^2 + 1 = 1 \neq 0 \)  
   - \( x = 1 \): \( 1^3 + 2(1)^2 + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \equiv 1 \mod 3 \neq 0 \)  
   - \( x = 2 \): \( 2^3 + 2(2)^2 + 1 = 8 + 8 + 1 = 17 \equiv 2 \mod 3 \neq 0 \)  
   Since the polynomial has no roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \), it is irreducible. Thus, \( c = 2 \) is valid.

### Step 3: Match \( c = 2 \) to the options
From the given options, \( c = 2 \) corresponds to **option I**.

### Final Answer
I
