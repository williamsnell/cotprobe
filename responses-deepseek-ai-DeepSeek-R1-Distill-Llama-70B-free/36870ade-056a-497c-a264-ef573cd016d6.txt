Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that a and b are real numbers with a ranging from -3 to 1 and b ranging from -2 to 4. We're supposed to find the probability that their product, a·b, is positive. And we need to express the answer as a common fraction.

Hmm, right. So, I know that the product of two numbers is positive in two cases: either both numbers are positive or both are negative. So the probability will be the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios.

But wait, since a and b are chosen uniformly at random from their intervals, I think I can model this geometrically. Like, the possible (a, b) pairs form a rectangle in the coordinate system, and the area where a·b > 0 divided by the total area will give the probability.

Alright, let's break it down. First, I'll figure out the lengths of the intervals for a and b.

For a: from -3 to 1. That's a length of 1 - (-3) = 4 units.

For b: from -2 to 4. That's 4 - (-2) = 6 units.

So the total area of all possible (a, b) pairs is 4 * 6 = 24 square units. So the denominator of the probability will be 24.

Now, I need to find the area where a·b is positive. As I thought earlier, that's when both a and b are positive, or both are negative.

Let me visualize the a-b plane. I'll consider the rectangle from a=-3 to 1 and b=-2 to 4.

First, the region where both a and b are positive. For a to be positive, a must be greater than 0. So a ranges from 0 to 1. For b to be positive, b must be greater than 0, so from 0 to 4.

So the area where both are positive is a rectangle from a=0 to 1 and b=0 to 4. The area is (1-0)*(4-0) = 1*4 = 4.

Second, the region where both a and b are negative. a negative means a is between -3 and 0. b negative means b is between -2 and 0.

So the area is (0 - (-3)) * (0 - (-2)) = 3 * 2 = 6.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that all? Because when a is negative and b is negative, their product is positive. So adding these two areas together will give the total area where a·b is positive.

So total favorable area is 4 + 6 = 10.

Wait, hold on. Let me think again. Because I might be missing something here. Let me make a table of the possible quadrants.

In the a-b plane, the a axis ranges from -3 to 1, and the b axis from -2 to 4. So the origin (0,0) is inside this rectangle.

The regions where a·b is positive are:

1. First quadrant: a > 0, b > 0. So a from 0 to 1, b from 0 to 4. Area is 1*4=4.

2. Third quadrant: a < 0, b < 0. So a from -3 to 0, b from -2 to 0. Area is 3*2=6.

So total area is 4+6=10.

Therefore, the probability is 10 / 24, which simplifies to 5/12. Wait, but 10 divided by 24 is 5/12. So the probability is 5/12.

Looking at the options, option E is 5/12. So is that the answer? Hmm.

Wait, but wait another thought. Because in the a and b ranges, are there any cases where a or b is zero? Because if a is zero, then the product is zero, which is not positive. Similarly for b. So when a is exactly 0 or b is exactly 0, the product is zero, which doesn't count as positive. But since these are lines in the plane, their area is zero, so they don't contribute to the probability. So I don't need to adjust for that.

So yes, the favorable area is 10, total area 24, so 10/24 simplifies to 5/12.

So the correct answer should be E: 5/12.

To determine the probability that the product \(a \cdot b\) is positive, we analyze the conditions under which this occurs: either both \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, or both are negative. The ranges for \(a\) and \(b\) are given as \(-3 \leq a \leq 1\) and \(-2 \leq b \leq 4\), respectively. The total area of all possible \((a, b)\) pairs is calculated as:

\[
\text{Total area} = (1 - (-3)) \cdot (4 - (-2)) = 4 \cdot 6 = 24.
\]

### Case 1: Both \(a\) and \(b\) are positive
- \(a\) ranges from \(0\) to \(1\), and \(b\) ranges from \(0\) to \(4\).
- The area for this region is:
  \[
  (1 - 0) \cdot (4 - 0) = 1 \cdot 4 = 4.
  \]

### Case 2: Both \(a\) and \(b\) are negative
- \(a\) ranges from \(-3\) to \(0\), and \(b\) ranges from \(-2\) to \(0\).
- The area for this region is:
  \[
  (0 - (-3)) \cdot (0 - (-2)) = 3 \cdot 2 = 6.
  \]

### Total favorable area
The total area where \(a \cdot b > 0\) is the sum of the areas from both cases:
\[
\text{Total favorable area} = 4 + 6 = 10.
\]

### Probability
The probability that \(a \cdot b\) is positive is the ratio of the favorable area to the total area:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Favorable area}}{\text{Total area}} = \frac{10}{24} = \frac{5}{12}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**E: \(\frac{5}{12}\)**
