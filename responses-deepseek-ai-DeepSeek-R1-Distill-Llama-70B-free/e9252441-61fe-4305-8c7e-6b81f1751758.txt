Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. The equation is x³ minus x minus 4 equals zero. I need to find the interval where the smallest positive root lies and then use the bisection method to get the root correct to two decimal places. The options are given from A to J, so I'll have to choose the right one after working through it.

First, let me think about what the problem is asking. The equation is a cubic, so it's of the third degree. Cubic equations can have up to three real roots, but I'm only interested in the smallest positive one here. The question also mentions using the bisection method, which is a numerical method for finding roots. So I'll probably have to apply that.

But before jumping into the bisection method, I remember that the intermediate value theorem can help me find an interval where the root exists. So I need to find two points, a and b, such that the function f(x) changes sign between them. That means f(a) and f(b) should have opposite signs. Since it's a root-finding problem, the function will cross the x-axis somewhere between a and b.

The function here is f(x) = x³ - x -4. I'll start by plugging in some values to see where the function changes sign. Let's try x=1 first. Plugging in, I get 1 -1 -4 = -4. So f(1) is -4. Now, try x=2. f(2) is 8 -2 -4=2. So f(2)=2. So between 1 and 2, the function goes from negative to positive, which means there's a root there. So the interval [1,2] contains a root.

Wait, but the question is asking for the smallest positive root. So if there's a root between 1 and 2, is that the only positive root? Let me check x=0. f(0)=0 -0 -4= -4. x=1 is -4, x=2 is +2. So between 1 and 2, function crosses from -ve to +ve. So the root is between 1 and 2. That's my initial interval.

Now, the next step is to apply the bisection method to find the root to two decimal places. The bisection method works by repeatedly narrowing down the interval where the function changes sign. Each iteration finds the midpoint, evaluates the function at the midpoint, and then selects the subinterval where the sign changes continue.

Let me outline the steps. I'll start with a=1 and b=2. Compute f(a) and f(b). Since f(a) is negative and f(b) positive, the root is in (a,b). The midpoint c is (a+b)/2, which is 1.5. Compute f(c). If f(c) is positive, then the root is in (a,c). If negative, it's in (c,b). Repeat this until the interval is small enough that the midpoint is accurate to two decimals.

So let's start. 

Iteration 1:
a=1, b=2. c=1.5. f(1.5)= (1.5)^3 -1.5 -4 = 3.375 -1.5 -4 = -2.125. So f(c) is negative. So the root is between c=1.5 and b=2. Now the new interval is (1.5, 2).

Iteration 2:
a=1.5, b=2. c=(1.5+2)/2=1.75. Compute f(1.75)= (1.75)^3 -1.75 -4. Let's calculate that. 1.75^3 is 1.75 *1.75=3.0625, times 1.75 is 5.359375. So 5.359375 -1.75=3.609375 -4= -0.390625. So f(c)= -0.390625. Still negative. So the root is between 1.75 and 2.

Iteration 3:
a=1.75, b=2. c=1.875. f(1.875)= (1.875)^3 -1.875 -4. Let's compute 1.875^3. 1.875 is 15/8. (15/8)^3 = 3375/(512) ≈6.591796875. So 6.591796875 -1.875=4.716796875 -4=0.716796875. So f(c)= ~0.7168, which is positive. So the root is between a=1.75 and c=1.875.

Now the interval is (1.75, 1.875).

Iteration 4:
a=1.75, b=1.875. c= (1.75+1.875)/2=1.8125. Compute f(1.8125)= (1.8125)^3 -1.8125 -4.

Let me calculate 1.8125^3. 1.8125 is 29/16. (29/16)^3 = (29^3)/(16^3) = 24389/4096 ≈5.96484375. So f(c)=5.96484375 -1.8125 -4. 

5.96484375 -1.8125 =4.15234375. 4.15234375 -4=0.15234375. So f(c)= ~0.1523, which is positive. So the root is between a=1.75 and c=1.8125.

Now the interval is (1.75, 1.8125).

Iteration 5:
a=1.75, b=1.8125. c= (1.75+1.8125)/2=1.78125. Compute f(1.78125).

1.78125^3: Let's compute step by step. 1.78125 *1.78125 = 3.171875 (since 1.78^2 is approx 3.1684, but exact for 1.78125 is 3.171875). Then multiply by 1.78125 again: 3.171875 *1.78125. Let me compute this as 3 *1.78125=5.34375, 0.171875 *1.78125. 

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 1.78125 * 3.171875. Alternatively, I can compute 1.78125^3:

1.78125 * 1.78125 = (1.75 + 0.03125)^2 = 1.75² + 2*1.75*0.03125 +0.03125² = 3.0625 + 0.109375 + 0.0009765625≈3.1728515625.

Then, 3.1728515625 * 1.78125. Let's compute:

3 *1.78125=5.34375, 0.1728515625 *1.78125 ≈0.3083. So total ≈5.34375+0.3083≈5.65205. So f(c)=5.65205 -1.78125 -4=5.65205 -5.78125≈-0.1292. So f(c)= -0.1292, which is negative.

So the function at c=1.78125 is negative. Therefore, the root lies between 1.78125 and 1.8125.

Now the interval is (1.78125, 1.8125).

Iteration 6:
a=1.78125, b=1.8125. c=(1.78125+1.8125)/2=1.796875. Compute f(1.796875).

1.796875^3. Let me compute this step by step. 1.796875 is 1.75 + 0.046875. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach would be faster, but I'm doing this manually.

Compute 1.796875 *1.796875: 

First, 1.796875 *1.796875. Let me compute:

1.796875 *1.796875 = (1.8 - 0.003125)^2 = (1.8)^2 - 2*1.8*0.003125 + (0.003125)^2 = 3.24 - 0.01125 + 0.000009765625≈3.22876.

Then multiply by 1.796875 again. So 3.22876 *1.796875. Let's compute:

3 *1.796875 =5.390625.

0.22876 *1.796875 ≈0.41137 (since 0.2*1.796875=0.359375; 0.02876*1.796875≈0.0516, so total ≈0.359375+0.0516≈0.410975).

So total ≈5.390625 +0.410975≈5.8016. So f(c)=5.8016 -1.796875 -4.

5.8016 -1.796875=4.004725. 4.004725 -4=0.004725. So f(c)=≈0.004725, which is positive.

So now, the function at c=1.796875 is positive. The function at a=1.78125 is negative. Therefore, the root is between 1.78125 and 1.796875.

The interval is now (1.78125, 1.796875).

Now, let's check the midpoint. The difference between a and b is 0.015625.

Iteration 7:
a=1.78125, b=1.796875. c= (1.78125 +1.796875)/2=1.7890625. Compute f(1.7890625).

Compute 1.7890625^3.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tedious, but let's proceed. Let me compute 1.7890625 *1.7890625 first.

1.7890625 *1.7890625: Let me approximate. 1.78^2 is about 3.1684. 1.79^2 is about 3.2041. So let's compute more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find an exact way. Let me write 1.7890625 as a fraction. 1.7890625 = 1 + 0.7890625. 0.7890625 is 25.3/32? Wait, 0.7890625 *32=25.25. So 25.25/32=101/128. Wait, 25.25 is 101/4? No, 25.25 is 101/4? Wait, no. 0.7890625= (0.5 + 0.25 + 0.0390625) = 1/2 +1/4 + 1/25.6? Not sure, perhaps it's better to compute the square.

But maybe I should just compute 1.7890625 multiplied by itself:

Let me write 1.7890625 as 1.7890625 = 1 + 0.7 + 0.08 + 0.0090625. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to note that 1.7890625 is 1.7890625 = 1.78 + 0.0090625. So (1.78 + 0.0090625)^2 = (1.78)^2 + 2*(1.78)*(0.0090625) + (0.0090625)^2.

1.78^2 is 3.1684. 2*(1.78)*(0.0090625)= 2*1.78*0.0090625= 3.56 *0.0090625≈0.0323. (0.0090625)^2≈0.000082. So total is approximately 3.1684 +0.0323 +0.000082≈3.200782.

Then, 3.200782 multiplied by 1.7890625. Let me compute 3 *1.7890625=5.3671875. 0.200782 *1.7890625≈0.200782 *1.7890625. Let's compute that: 0.2 *1.7890625≈0.3578125; 0.000782 *1.7890625≈0.001398. So total≈0.3578125 +0.001398≈0.35921. So total ≈5.3671875 +0.35921≈5.7264. So 1.7890625^3≈5.7264.

So f(c)=5.7264 -1.7890625 -4 =5.7264 -5.7890625≈-0.06266. So f(c)=≈-0.06266, which is negative.

So the root is now between c=1.7890625 and b=1.796875.

Now the interval is (1.7890625, 1.796875).

Iteration 8:
a=1.7890625, b=1.796875. c= (1.7890625 +1.796875)/2 =1.79296875. Compute f(c).

Compute f(1.79296875)= (1.79296875)^3 -1.79296875 -4.

Hmm, calculating this without a calculator is tough, but let's try.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use linear approximation or consider previous steps. Wait, in the previous step, at c=1.796875, f(c)=0.004725. At c=1.7890625, f(c)= -0.06266. So the function is increasing as x increases, which makes sense because it's a cubic with positive leading coefficient.

So moving from a=1.7890625 (f=-0.06266) to c=1.79296875, which is the new midpoint. Let's compute f(1.79296875).

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the secant method or linear interpolation to estimate, but maybe it's better to proceed step by step.

Wait, maybe I can compute 1.79296875^3.

Let me compute 1.79296875^2 first. Let's approximate it.

1.79296875 is approximately 1.793. Let me compute 1.793^2. 1.79^2 is 3.2041, 1.793^2= (1.79 +0.003)^2= 1.79^2 + 2*1.79*0.003 +0.003^2=3.2041 +0.01074 +0.000009≈3.21485.

Then, 1.793^3 = 3.21485 *1.793. Let me compute that.

3 *1.793=5.379. 0.21485 *1.793≈0.21485*1.79≈0.3855. So total≈5.379 +0.3855≈5.7645. So f(c)=5.7645 -1.79296875 -4.

5.7645 -1.79296875=3.97153125. 3.97153125-4= -0.02846875. So f(c)=≈-0.02846875, which is still negative.

So the root is between 1.79296875 and 1.796875.

Now, the interval is (1.79296875, 1.796875).

Iteration 9:
a=1.79296875, b=1.796875. c=(1.79296875 +1.796875)/2=1.794921875. Compute f(c).

1.794921875^3. Let me approximate. At x=1.794921875.

Wait, perhaps I can use the previous calculations. At x=1.796875, f(x)=0.004725. At x=1.79296875, f(x)= -0.02846875.

The difference in x is about 0.00390625. The difference in f(x) is 0.004725 - (-0.02846875)=0.03319375 over an x increase of 0.00390625.

So, to find where f(x)=0, we can set up a linear approximation.

Let me denote x1=1.79296875, f(x1)= -0.02846875.

x2=1.796875, f(x2)=0.004725.

The line between these two points can be used to estimate the root.

The equation of the line is y = f(x1) + (f(x2)-f(x1))/(x2 -x1) * (x -x1).

We need to find x where y=0.

So,

0 = -0.02846875 + (0.004725 +0.02846875)/(0.00390625) * (x -1.79296875)

Compute numerator: 0.004725 +0.02846875=0.03319375.

Denominator: 0.00390625.

So slope m= 0.03319375 /0.00390625= approximately 8.5.

So,

0.02846875 = 8.5*(x -1.79296875).

x-1.79296875=0.02846875/8.5≈0.003348.

x≈1.79296875 +0.003348≈1.796316.

Wait, but that's beyond x2=1.796875. That can't be right. Because the line goes from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2), and the root is within x1 and x2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the equation is:

0 = y1 + m*(x -x1), where m is (y2 -y1)/(x2 -x1).

So,

x = x1 - y1*(x2 -x1)/(y2 -y1)

Plugging in numbers:

x1=1.79296875, y1=-0.02846875.

x2 -x1=0.00390625.

y2 -y1=0.004725 - (-0.02846875)=0.03319375.

So,

x = x1 - (y1 * (x2 -x1))/(y2 -y1)

=1.79296875
