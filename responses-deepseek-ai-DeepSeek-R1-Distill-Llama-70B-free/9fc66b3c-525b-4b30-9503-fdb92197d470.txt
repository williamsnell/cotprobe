Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem gives me a bunch of national income figures for a given year in billions of dollars. The data includes GNP, transfer payments, indirect business taxes, personal taxes, capital consumption allowance, undistributed corporate profits, social security contributions, and corporate income taxes. Then, I'm supposed to compute four things: a) Net National Product (NNP), b) National Income (NI), c) Personal Income (PI), and d) Disposable Income (DI). After that, I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that GNP stands for Gross National Product, which is the total value of all final goods and services produced by a country's citizens, including those abroad, minus the value of foreign goods and services. But to get Net National Product (NNP), I think I need to subtract the capital consumption allowance, which represents depreciation. So NNP = GNP - Capital Consumption Allowance.

Let me write down the given data first:

- GNP: $1,692 billion
- Transfer payments: $232 billion
- Indirect business taxes: $163 billion
- Personal taxes: $193 billion
- Capital consumption allowance: $180 billion
- Undistributed corporate profits: $18 billion
- Social security contributions: $123 billion
- Corporate income taxes: $65 billion

Starting with part a), NNP. So NNP = GNP - Depreciation (which is the capital consumption allowance here). So that's 1,692 - 180. Let me calculate that: 1,692 minus 180 is 1,512 billion. So NNP is $1,512 billion. Looking at the options, I see that option D has NNP at $1,512. So that's a possible candidate.

Next, part b) National Income (NI). I think NI is calculated by taking GNP and then subtracting indirect business taxes, transfer payments, and adding back the capital consumption allowance. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, I remember that NI is GNP minus the capital consumption allowance (so that's NNP) minus other things like indirect taxes and transfer payments. Or maybe it's GNP minus depreciation, corporate taxes, and taxes on production, then adding some things like subsidies.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula. National Income (NI) is calculated as GNP minus depreciation (capital consumption allowance) minus indirect business taxes. Or wait, another approach: National Income is the sum of all the incomes earned by households, including wages, rents, interest, and profits. So maybe I need to subtract certain non-income components from GNP.

I think the correct formula is NI = GNP - Capital Consumption Allowance - Indirect Business Taxes - Transfer Payments. Wait, no, transfer payments are not part of the production factors' income. Let me try to recall the correct formula. Oh right, the formula is NI = GNP - Capital Consumption Allowance - Indirect Business Taxes. Because GNP includes indirect taxes and depreciation, which aren't part of the income that goes to factors of production.

Wait, actually, I might be mixing this up. Let me think again. GNP is the total output. To get NI, we subtract Capital Consumption Allowance (depreciation) and also subtract indirect taxes and add subsidies. But in this problem, I don't see any subsidies mentioned. So perhaps NI = GNP - Capital Consumption Allowance - Indirect Business Taxes.

So plugging the numbers: GNP is 1,692. Subtract Capital Consumption Allowance (180) and Indirect Business Taxes (163). So 1,692 - 180 = 1,512. Then 1,512 - 163 = 1,349 billion. So NI would be $1,349 billion. Looking at the options, option D has NI as $1,349. So that matches.

Moving on to part c) Personal Income (PI). PI is the income that households receive, so it's National Income minus certain items. The formula I remember is PI = NI - Corporate Income Taxes - Undistributed Corporate Profits + Transfer Payments. Wait, why plus transfer payments? Because transfer payments like social security are part of household income, but they aren't part of NI because NI includes the income earned, not the transfers received.

Wait, let me get the exact formula. The correct formula is PI = NI - (Corporate Profits) + Transfer Payments + Social Security Contributions. Or wait, perhaps PI = NI - (Corporate Taxes + Undistributed Profits) + Transfer Payments + Social Security Contributions. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, another approach: NI includes the profits of corporations, both distributed and undistributed. Personal income is what people actually receive. So for PI, we take NI, subtract corporate taxes and undistributed profits (since those aren't part of people's income), and then add in transfer payments and social security contributions because those are income received by individuals.

Wait, maybe the formula is PI = NI - Corporate Profits (which includes both distributed as dividends and undistributed) - Social Security Contributions (since they are part of taxes), then add Transfer Payments. No, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the correct formula is: PI = NI - Undistributed Corporate Profits - Corporate Income Taxes + Transfer Payments + Social Security Contributions.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me recall. National Income (NI) is the sum of all incomes earned by households, including corporate profits. Personal Income (PI) is the income actually received by households. So PI = NI - Corporate Profits (both distributed and undistributed) + Transfer Payments. Because distributed profits are part of dividends, which are part of PI, but if they're included in NI as corporate profits, then perhaps PI = NI - Undistributed Corporate Profits - Corporate Taxes + Transfer Payments.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me look it up in my notes mentally. Oh right, the correct formula is:

Personal Income (PI) = National Income (NI) + Transfer Payments + Social Security Contributions - Undistributed Corporate Profits - Corporate Income Taxes.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me try again. National Income includes the profits that corporations make, whether they are distributed or not. But Personal Income includes the dividends that individuals receive (which are part of distributed profits) but not the undistributed profits. So, to get PI from NI, we subtract undistributed corporate profits and corporate taxes, and then add transfer payments and other income that individuals receive.

Alternatively, the formula is:

PI = NI - (Corporate Income Taxes + Undistributed Corporate Profits) + Transfer Payments + Social Security Contributions.

Wait, but Social Security Contributions are part of the taxes paid by individuals and employers. So perhaps they are subtracted in NI but then added back in PI? No, I'm getting more confused.

Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step. Let's list the components that go into PI.

1. Wages, salaries, and supplements (part of NI)
2. Rents, interest, dividends received by persons
3. Proprietors' income
4. Farm income
5. Transfer payments (like social security)
6. Other income (like dividends)

But to get PI from NI, perhaps:

PI = NI - (Corporate Profits) + Transfer Payments + Dividends.

Wait, but that's getting too detailed. Let me think of the standard formula. I think the standard formula is:

PI = NI - (Undistributed Corporate Profits + Corporate Income Taxes) + Transfer Payments + Social Security Contributions.

Wait, no, Social Security Contributions are part of the taxes, so perhaps they are subtracted in NI. But in PI, those contributions are not part of your take-home pay, so maybe we don't add them back. Hmm, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is PI = NI - (Undistributed Corporate Profits + Corporate Income Taxes) + (Transfer Payments + Social Security Benefits). Because Transfer Payments include Social Security, so maybe we just add Transfer Payments. Let me check the numbers.

From the data, Transfer Payments are $232, Social Security Contributions are $123. So perhaps Transfer Payments are the payments made, which are part of PI, while Social Security Contributions are the taxes paid, which are part of the taxes, so they are subtracted in NI.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

PI = NI - (Undistributed Corporate Profits + Corporate Income Taxes) + Transfer Payments.

So let's compute that:

NI is $1,349 billion.

Undistributed Corporate Profits: $18 billion.

Corporate Income Taxes: $65 billion.

Transfer Payments: $232 billion.

So PI = 1,349 - (18 + 65) + 232.

Calculating step by step:

18 + 65 = 83.

1,349 - 83 = 1,266.

1,266 + 232 = 1,498.

Wait, that can't be right because none of the options have PI that high. The options for PI in the choices are around 1,300 to 1,455.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try another approach. Perhaps the formula is:

PI = NI - Social Security Contributions - Corporate Income Taxes - Undistributed Corporate Profits + Transfer Payments.

Wait, that might make more sense. Let's try:

PI = NI - (Social Security Contributions + Corporate Income Taxes + Undistributed Profits) + Transfer Payments.

So plugging in the numbers:

1,349 - (123 + 65 + 18) + 232.

Calculate inside the parentheses: 123 +65=188 +18=206.

1,349 - 206 = 1,143.

1,143 + 232 = 1,375.

So PI is $1,375 billion. Looking at the options, option D has PI at $1,375, which matches. So that's correct.

Wait, but why did I subtract Social Security Contributions here? Because Social Security Contributions are part of the taxes that individuals and employers pay, so they are subtracted from NI to get PI. Because in NI, Social Security Contributions are considered taxes, so they reduce NI but when calculating PI, we add back Transfer Payments which include Social Security benefits. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it this way: Transfer Payments include Social Security payments received by individuals, while Social Security Contributions are the taxes paid, which are part of the taxes in NI.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

PI = NI - (Corporate Profits) - (Taxes on Production and Imports) - Contributions for Social Insurance + Transfer Payments + Subsidies.

But I'm getting too deep here. Maybe it's better to stick with the formula that gave me the correct PI as per the options, which is $1,375 billion in option D.

Now, part d) Disposable Income (DI). Disposable Income is Personal Income plus Transfer Payments minus Personal Taxes. Wait, no, because Transfer Payments are already included in PI. So DI = PI - Personal Taxes.

Wait, no, wait. Personal Income (PI) already includes Transfer Payments. But Disposable Income is the income that people can spend or save, so it's PI minus Personal Taxes.

Wait, but Personal Taxes are part of the taxes paid, so in the formula, DI = PI - Personal Taxes.

So PI is $1,375. Personal Taxes are $193. So DI = 1,375 - 193 = 1,182 billion.

Looking at the options, option D's Disposable Income is $1,182 billion. So that matches.

So putting it all together:

a) NNP = 1,512

b) NI = 1,349

c) PI = 1,375

d) DI = 1,182

Looking at the options:

Option D: NNP $1,512 billion, NI $1,349, PI $1,375, DI $1,182.

Yes, that matches exactly. So the correct answer is option D.
