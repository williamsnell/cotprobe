Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Within a few weeks of treatment with the drug 3TC, a patient's HIV population consists entirely of 3TC-resistant viruses. How can this result best be explained?

Options:

A: The patient was initially infected with a 3TC-resistant strain of the virus.
B: The patient's immune system developed a resistance to 3TC, causing the drug to become ineffective.
C: The 3TC drug triggered a mutation in the HIV virus, causing it to become resistant.
D: The patient's body started producing 3TC-resistant viruses in response to the drug treatment.
E: A few drug-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.
F: The HIV virus can naturally resist any form of drug treatment.
G: The patient must have become reinfected with 3TC-resistant viruses.
H: HIV began making drug-resistant versions of reverse transcriptase in response to the drug.
I: The 3TC drug led to an increase in the production of HIV viruses.
J: HIV can change its surface proteins and resist vaccines.

Okay, so I've got this question about HIV treatment and drug resistance. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's think. The question says that after a few weeks of treatment with 3TC, the patient's HIV is entirely resistant to it. How does that happen?

Well, I remember that HIV is a virus that mutates a lot. It's known for having a high mutation rate because it replicates so quickly and doesn't have good proofreading mechanisms. So when you start treating someone with an antiretroviral drug like 3TC (which is lamivudine, I think), the drug targets the reverse transcriptase enzyme of the virus.

Wait, how does drug resistance develop? I think it's usually not that the drug causes mutations. Oh right, the drug doesn't cause the mutations. Instead, the virus population already has random mutations because it replicates so much. Some of these mutations might make the virus resistant to the drug.

So when the patient starts taking 3TC, the drug will kill most of the viruses. But if there are a few that are resistant because they had a mutation before the treatment started, those will survive and replicate. Over time, their numbers increase because the drug isn't affecting them. This is natural selection at workâ€”only the resistant ones can survive and reproduce, so the population becomes all resistant.

Looking at the options. Option E says that a few resistant viruses were present initially, and natural selection increased their frequency. That makes sense. Option C suggests the drug triggered the mutation, which I don't think is correct because the mutations are random and happen regardless of the drug's presence.

Option A says the patient was initially infected with a resistant strain. That's possible, but the question doesn't specify that. It's more likely that the virus wasn't all resistant initially but had some variants.

Option B says the patient's immune system became resistant. No, that doesn't make sense. The immune system isn't what's resisting 3TC; it's the virus that's becoming resistant.

Option D says the body started producing resistant viruses. No, the body doesn't produce the viruses; the viruses replicate on their own.

Option H says HIV made resistant reverse transcriptase in response. I think that's partially correct, but it's more about the selection process rather than the response to the drug. The mutations pre-exist.

So putting it all together, the best explanation is E: a few resistant viruses were present at the start, and natural selection made them dominant.

The development of 3TC resistance in the HIV population within a few weeks of treatment can be explained by the presence of pre-existing resistant viral strains before treatment began. HIV mutates rapidly due to its high replication rate and lack of proofreading mechanisms. When 3TC is administered, it exerts selective pressure, killing susceptible viruses while allowing resistant variants to survive and proliferate. Over time, this natural selection process results in a population dominated by drug-resistant viruses. This explanation aligns with option E, which correctly identifies that a few resistant viruses were present initially and their frequency increased due to natural selection.
