Question:

A state has recently enacted a statute requiring all prospective voters in state elections who wish to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name, and designate the office for which the candidate is running. The statute provides that such information must be written on the ballot in ink inan appropriate space. A write-in candidate is a German-American and is of the opinion that he needs a large turnout of German voters in order to win the election. As a result, his campaign manager decides to mail to every registered German voter a tear-off sticker, which bears the candidate's name and office for which he is running. Since many native German people are not proficient in reading and writing English, the campaign manager believes that many of the voters will have difficulty writing the candidate's name and office on the ballot. As a result, the campaign manager has mounted an extensive media campaign to inform voters on how to apply the stickers to the ballot. Five months prior to the election an election official notifies the candidate's campaign committee that the tear-off stickers do not comply with the state statute. In her letter, the official explains that state election officials are of the opinion that it is necessary for potential voters to write the candidate's name in ink. Therefore, she concludes that the stickers do not comply with statutory requirements. Three weeks later, the candidate filed suit in federal district court against state election officials, claiming that their interpretation of the state statute violates the U. S. Constitution. Which of the following sets forth the strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make against the interpretation of the statute by the state officials?

Options:

A: It unreasonably discriminates against German voters who lack a proficiency in the English language.
B: It unreasonably interferes with the exclusive federal election power as embodied in the Fifteenth Amendment.
C: It goes against the spirit of the Twenty-fourth Amendment by effectively imposing a "literacy tax."
D: It unreasonably discriminates against non-English speaking voters in general.
E: It violates the Equal Protection Clause by treating write-in candidates differently.
F: It unreasonably discriminates against write-in candidates for public office.
G: It unreasonably limits the means by which a candidate can campaign, infringing on democratic practices.
H: It unreasonably restricts freedom of speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment.
I: It unreasonably interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act outlawing literacy tests.
J: It interferes with the right to vote as guaranteed by the Nineteenth Amendment.

Okay, so I've got this constitutional law question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's break it down step by step. The question is about a state statute regarding write-in candidates and whether the state's interpretation of it violates the U.S. Constitution.

Alright, the setup: A state passed a law that requires voters who want to write-in a candidate to print the candidate's full name and designate the office in ink on the ballot. A write-in candidate, who's German-American, is trying to get a lot of German voters to support him. His campaign manager sends out tear-off stickers with the candidate's name and office to make it easier for voters who might not be proficient in English. But the election official says these stickers don't comply with the statute because voters need to write the name in ink themselves.

The candidate sues, claiming the officials' interpretation violates the Constitution. The question is, what's the strongest constitutional argument he can make?

Looking at the options, I need to think about what constitutional provisions might apply here. The main issues seem to be voting rights, equal protection, and possibly discrimination against certain groups.

Option A says it unreasonably discriminates against German voters who aren't proficient in English. That sounds like a possible Equal Protection claim, maybe under the 14th Amendment. But is it discrimination based on national origin or language? I remember that laws affecting the right to vote can't discriminate based on race, color, or language under the Voting Rights Act, but also under the Constitution.

Option D is similar but broader, saying it discriminates against non-English speakers in general. That might be a stronger claim because it's a larger group, but I'm not sure if the statute specifically targets them or just requires writing.

Option C suggests it's a literacy tax, referencing the 24th Amendment, which prohibits poll taxes. But the 24th Amendment is about money, not literacy. Wait, but the Supreme Court has held that literacy tests are a form of voter discrimination, so maybe that's related to the 15th Amendment, which prohibits denying the vote based on race or color, but not explicitly language. However, the Voting Rights Act does ban literacy tests.

Option I says it interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which outlawed literacy tests. That could be a good angle because if the statute requires writing in a certain way, it might act as a literacy test, which is prohibited.

Option A and D are about discrimination against specific groups, while I is about violating a federal law against literacy tests. Option C is about the 24th Amendment, but that's more about money, not literacy.

The candidate's argument is that the requirement to write in ink without allowing stickers might disproportionately affect non-English speakers who might struggle with writing the name correctly. So it's acting like a literacy test, which is prohibited by the Voting Rights Act.

Wait, but the statute requires writing in ink, but the campaign provided stickers. The official said voters must write the name, not use stickers. So the argument is that this requirement is effectively a literacy test because it requires voters to write, which could exclude those who can't write English well.

So under the Voting Rights Act, especially Section 2, which prohibits voting practices that result in the denial of the right to vote based on race, color, or language. Since German voters are a language minority, this statute could be challenged under that.

Option I says it interferes with the 1965 Voting Rights Act outlawing literacy tests. That seems to fit because the requirement to write in ink might act as a literacy test.

Alternatively, option C is about the 24th Amendment and a "literacy tax." But the 24th Amendment doesn't directly address literacy, it's about poll taxes. So that might not be the best fit.

Option A and D are Equal Protection arguments, but they might not be as strong as the Voting Rights Act claim, which specifically addresses literacy tests.

So the strongest argument would probably be that the statute's interpretation violates the Voting Rights Act by imposing a literacy test, which is prohibited.

Looking back at the options, option I is about the Voting Rights Act. So that's probably the answer.

The strongest constitutional argument the candidate could make is that the state officials' interpretation of the statute effectively imposes a literacy test, which is prohibited under the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The requirement for voters to write the candidate's name and office in ink unfairly burdens non-English proficient voters, such as German speakers, by creating a barrier to voting. This aligns with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which bans voting practices that deny the right to vote based on race, color, or language. The use of stickers would facilitate voting for those with limited English proficiency, and disallowing them could disproportionately affect this group, violating federal protections against literacy-based discrimination.
