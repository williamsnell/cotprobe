Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the amount of positive charge in moles of molecular hydrogen gas. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is: How many megacoulombs of positive charge are in 1.00 mol of neutral H₂ gas? The options are from A to J, each with different values.

Wait, molecular hydrogen is H₂, which is a diatomic molecule. Each molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms. So, each molecule has two protons and two electrons, right? Because each hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron.

But wait, the molecule is neutral overall. So the total charge should be zero. That makes sense because the positive and negative charges cancel out. But the question is about the positive charge specifically.

So, each H atom has a +1 charge from the proton. Since each H₂ molecule has two H atoms, that's 2 * (+1) = +2 charge per molecule. But wait, the molecule itself is neutral, so how does that work? Oh, right, because each H has one electron as well, so each molecule has two electrons, contributing a -2 charge. So total is +2 -2 = 0. Correct, that's why it's neutral.

But the question is asking about the positive charge. So in each molecule, the positive charge is +2. So I'm looking for the total positive charge in 1 mole of H₂.

Now, I need to calculate how much that is in coulombs, then convert to megacoulombs.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, find the number of H₂ molecules in one mole. Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 molecules/mol. So 1 mole has 6.022e23 molecules.

Each molecule has 2 protons, so each contributes a +1 charge. So each molecule has 2 * (+e), where e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602e-19 coulombs.

Wait, no. Wait, each proton has a charge of +e. So each H atom contributes +e. So per H₂ molecule, 2 * e.

So the total positive charge per mole is:

Number of molecules per mole (Avogadro's number) multiplied by the charge per molecule.

So:

Total charge = (6.022e23 molecules/mol) * (2 * 1.602e-19 C/molecule)

Let me compute this.

First, 6.022e23 * 2 = 1.2044e24.

Then multiply by 1.602e-19 C:

1.2044e24 * 1.602e-19 = Let's compute the exponent first. 1e24 * 1e-19 = 1e5.

So 1.2044 * 1.602 = approximately 1.9289. So 1.9289e5 coulombs.

Wait, 1e5 coulombs is 100,000 coulombs. But wait, 1 megacoulomb is 1e6 coulombs (since mega is 1e6). So I need to convert this to megacoulombs.

So 1.9289e5 C is equal to 0.19289e6 C, which is 0.19289 MC.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.19 MC. So that would be the closest.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again to be sure.

Wait, no wait, each H atom has a charge of +e. So per molecule, 2 * +e. So for each molecule, the positive charge is 2e.

So per mole (Avogadro's number of molecules), the positive charge is:

(6.022e23) * 2 * 1.602e-19 C.

Calculate that:

6.022e23 * 2 = 1.2044e24.

1.2044e24 * 1.602e-19 = Let me compute 1.2044 * 1.602 first.

1.2 * 1.6 is 1.92, but more accurately:

1.2044 * 1.602 = 

Let me compute:

1 * 1.602 = 1.602

0.2044 * 1.602 ≈ 0.3273

So total is approximately 1.602 + 0.3273 = 1.9293.

So 1.9293e5 C.

Which is 192,930 C, or 0.19293 MC, which is approximately 0.193 MC. So 0.19 MC when rounded to two decimal places. So option G is 0.19 MC, which fits.

So the correct answer should be G.

To determine how many megacoulombs of positive charge are in 1.00 mol of neutral molecular hydrogen gas (H₂), we start by analyzing the molecular structure. Each H₂ molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms, and each hydrogen atom has one proton, contributing a charge of $+e$, where $e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C}$. Therefore, each H₂ molecule has a total positive charge of $2e$.

Next, we calculate the total positive charge in 1 mole of H₂. Using Avogadro's number ($6.022 \times 10^{23}$ molecules/mol), the total number of H₂ molecules in 1 mole is:

\[
6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol}.
\]

The total positive charge per mole is then given by:

\[
\text{Total charge} = (\text{Number of molecules}) \times (\text{Charge per molecule}),
\]

\[
\text{Total charge} = (6.022 \times 10^{23}) \times (2 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19}) \, \mathrm{C}.
\]

First, calculate $6.022 \times 10^{23} \times 2 = 1.2044 \times 10^{24}$. Then, multiply by $1.602 \times 10^{-19}$:

\[
1.2044 \times 10^{24} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} = 1.9293 \times 10^{5} \, \mathrm{C}.
\]

Convert this to megacoulombs (MC), where $1 \, \mathrm{MC} = 10^{6} \, \mathrm{C}$:

\[
1.9293 \times 10^{5} \, \mathrm{C} = 0.19293 \, \mathrm{MC}.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the total positive charge is approximately $0.19 \, \mathrm{MC}$. Comparing this result to the given options, the closest match is:

**G: $0.19 \, \mathrm{MC}$.**
