Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about copper and electromagnetic waves. Hmm, I need to find the depth of penetration of a plane wave normally incident on copper. The question gives me the conductivity (σ) and permeability (μ), and the frequency (f) is 200 Hz. 

Wait, I remember that the depth of penetration, also called the skin depth, is a measure of how far an electromagnetic wave can penetrate a conducting material. The formula for skin depth (δ) comes to mind. I think it's something like δ equals the square root of (something with π, μ, σ, and f). 

Let me think again. Oh right, the skin depth formula is δ = sqrt( (1) / (π * μ * σ * f) ) ), but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression. Another version I've seen is δ = (1/ (sqrt(π * μ * σ * f)) ), but that seems the same as the square root expression. Wait, no, because the square root of 1 over something is the same as 1 over the square root of that something. So both expressions are equivalent. So, δ = 1 / sqrt(π * μ * σ * f), right? 

Wait, another thought: sometimes the formula is written as sqrt( (μ * ε) / (ω) ), but wait, that's in terms of the permittivity ε and angular frequency ω. But copper is a good conductor, so in that case, the skin depth formula simplifies because the conductivity σ dominates over the permittivity. 

Wait, I think for a good conductor, the skin depth is given by δ = sqrt( (2 * μ) / (ω * σ) ) ), but I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify.

Oh wait, the general formula for skin depth in a conductor is δ = (1/ (α)), where α is the attenuation constant. And α is given by α = sqrt( (ω² μ ε) + (σ μ ω) ) / 2. Wait, no, that's perhaps for lossy materials. But for a good conductor, where σ >> ω ε, the expression simplifies. Because in a good conductor, the conduction current dominates over the displacement current. So, the skin depth formula for a good conductor is δ = sqrt( (2) / (ω σ μ) ) ). 

Wait, let me make sure. The skin depth is given by δ = (1/(sqrt(π μ σ f)) ), because ω is 2π f. So substituting ω = 2π f, we get:

δ = sqrt( 1/(π μ σ f) ) = 1/sqrt(π μ σ f). 

Wait, yes, that makes sense. So the formula is δ = 1 over the square root of (π multiplied by μ multiplied by σ multiplied by f). 

So to compute this, I need to plug in the given values. Let me write them down.

σ = 5.8 × 10^7 mhos/meter (Siemens per meter, which is equivalent to S/m, and S is the same as mho, which is the reciprocal of ohm.)

μ is given as 1.26 × 10^-6 H/m (Henrys per meter). For copper, I think the relative permeability is about 1, so that's correct.

f is 200 Hz.

So let's plug these into the formula.

First, compute the product π * μ * σ * f.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute π: approximately 3.1416.

Multiply by μ: 3.1416 * 1.26e-6 = ?

Let me compute 3.1416 * 1.26 ≈ 3.1416 * 1.26. Let's see, 3 * 1.26 is 3.78, 0.1416*1.26 is about 0.1786; so total is approximately 3.9586.

Wait, but actually, I can compute it more accurately.

3.1416 * 1.26:

Let me compute 3 * 1.26 = 3.78

0.1416 * 1.26: 0.1 * 1.26 is 0.126, 0.04 * 1.26 is 0.0504, 0.0016 *1.26 is 0.002016. So adding those: 0.126 + 0.0504 = 0.1764 + 0.002016 = 0.178416.

So total is 3.78 + 0.178416 = 3.958416.

So 3.1416 * 1.26e-6 = 3.958416e-6.

Now multiply by σ: 3.958416e-6 * 5.8e7 = ?

Let me compute 3.958e-6 *5.8e7.

3.958e-6 * 5.8e7 = 3.958 *5.8 * 1e1 (since 1e-6 *1e7 =1e1).

3.958 *5.8: let's compute that.

3 *5.8 =17.4, 0.958*5.8≈5.56 (since 0.9*5.8=5.22, 0.058*5.8≈0.3364, so total 5.22+0.3364=5.5564). So 17.4 +5.5564=22.9564.

Multiply by 1e1 (10): 22.9564 *10=229.564.

So 3.958e-6 *5.8e7 =229.564.

Now multiply by f: 229.564 * 200.

229.564 * 200 =45,912.8.

So the product inside the square root is π μ σ f =45,912.8.

Wait, no, wait. Because the product is π*μ*σ*f which is 3.1416 *1.26e-6 *5.8e7 *200. Wait, I think I messed up the order of multiplication.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier in the order of multiplication. Let me recompute.

Actually, the product is (π μ σ f). Let me compute each step carefully.

Compute π * μ: 3.1416 * 1.26e-6 = let me compute 3.1416 *1.26 = ~3.958, so 3.958e-6.

Then multiply by σ: 3.958e-6 *5.8e7 = let's compute 3.958 *5.8 = 22.96, and 1e-6 *1e7=1e1. So 22.96 *1e1=229.6.

Then multiply by f=200: 229.6 *200 =45,920.

So the product is approximately 45,920.

So, now, the formula is δ = 1 / sqrt(45920).

Compute sqrt(45920). Let's see, 200 squared is 40,000. 214 squared is 45796 (since 200^2=40000, 210^2=44100, 214^2= (210+4)^2=210^2 +2*210*4 +4^2=44100 +1680 +16=45796). 215^2 is 46225.

Our value is 45920, which is between 214^2=45796 and 215^2=46225.

Compute 214.3^2: let's see, 214 +0.3. (a+b)^2 = a² + 2ab +b².

So 214.3^2 = (214)^2 + 2*(214)*(0.3) + (0.3)^2.

=45796 + 128.4 + 0.09=45796+128.49=45924.49.

That's very close to our number, 45920. So sqrt(45920)= approximately 214.3 - a little less.

Wait, 214.3^2=45924.49, which is 4.49 more than 45920. So 45920 is 4.49 less than 214.3^2.

Hmm, the square root of 45920 is approximately 214.3 - (4.49/(2*214.3)).

Using the linear approximation: sqrt(x - dx) ≈ sqrt(x) - (dx/(2 sqrt(x))).

So dx=4.49, x=45924.49, sqrt(x)=214.3.

So sqrt(45920)= 214.3 - (4.49)/(2*214.3) ≈214.3 - (4.49)/(428.6)= 214.3 - ~0.01047= approx 214.2895.

So sqrt(45920)=~214.29.

So δ=1/214.29 ≈0.004666 meters.

Wait, 1/214.29 is approximately 0.004666 meters. Which is 4.666e-3 meters, which is 4.666 millimeters.

Looking at the options, option I is 4.66 ×10^-3 meters, which matches this.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck the calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, let me recompute the product πμσf.

- μ=1.26e-6, σ=5.8e7, f=200.

Compute step by step:

First, π * μ = 3.1416 * 1.26e-6 = 3.958e-6.

Then, 3.958e-6 * σ = 3.958e-6 *5.8e7 = let's compute 3.958 *5.8 =22.96, and 1e-6 *1e7=1e1, so 22.96 *1e1=229.6.

Then multiply by f=200: 229.6 *200=45,920.

So πμσf=45,920.

Then, δ=1/ sqrt(45,920) =1/ 214.289 ≈ 4.666e-3 meters.

Which is 4.666 ×10^-3 m, so option I.

Wait, but let me double-check if I used the right formula. Another way the formula is written is δ= sqrt( (1)/(π μ σ f) ), which is the same as 1/sqrt( π μ σ f ), which is the same as I did.

Yes, correct.

So the correct answer is I:4.66e-3 meters.

To determine the depth of penetration (skin depth) of a plane wave normally incident on copper, we use the formula for skin depth in a good conductor:

\[
\delta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi \mu \sigma f}}
\]

### Given Values:
- Conductivity, \(\sigma = 5.8 \times 10^7 \, \text{S/m}\)
- Permeability, \(\mu = 1.26 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{H/m}\)
- Frequency, \(f = 200 \, \text{Hz}\)

### Step 1: Compute the product \(\pi \mu \sigma f\)
1. Calculate \(\pi \mu\):
   \[
   \pi \mu = 3.1416 \times 1.26 \times 10^{-6} = 3.958 \times 10^{-6}
   \]

2. Multiply by \(\sigma\):
   \[
   \pi \mu \sigma = 3.958 \times 10^{-6} \times 5.8 \times 10^7 = 229.6
   \]

3. Multiply by \(f\):
   \[
   \pi \mu \sigma f = 229.6 \times 200 = 45,920
   \]

### Step 2: Compute the skin depth
The skin depth is given by:
\[
\delta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi \mu \sigma f}}
\]

Substitute \(\pi \mu \sigma f = 45,920\):
\[
\delta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{45,920}}
\]

Approximate \(\sqrt{45,920}\):
\[
\sqrt{45,920} \approx 214.29
\]

Thus:
\[
\delta = \frac{1}{214.29} \approx 4.666 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
The depth of penetration is approximately \(4.66 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}\), which corresponds to **option I**.
