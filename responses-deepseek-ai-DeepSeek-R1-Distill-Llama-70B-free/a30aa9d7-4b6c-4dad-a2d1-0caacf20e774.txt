The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Police received information from a reliable informant that a defendant would be extorting money from a victim. The informant gave the police explicit details about the extortion scheme: the defendant would be calling the victim from a public phone booth on a particular street corner on a certain date and time to make the extortionist demand. Without notif'ing the telephone company or seeking a warrant, the police installed an eavesdropping device on the public phone. At the time on the date specified by the informant, the defendant phoned the victim from the telephone booth and said, "You better pay me $5,000 by next week or I'll kill you and your family. " The defendant provided additional details about how and where to make the payoff. Based on the taped conversation, the police arrested the defendant and charged him with extortion. Prior to trial, the defendant's attorney moves to exclude the taped conversation from evidence. The defense motion should be

Options:

A: granted, because the police should have obtained a court order before recording the conversation.
B: denied, because the police had probable cause based on the information supplied by the informant.
C: denied, because the defendant did not have reasonable expectation of privacy.
D: granted, because the police violated the defendant's rights by not informing him of the eavesdropping device.
E: denied, because the information from the informant was reliable and specific.
F: granted, because the police did not obtain prior approval of the telephone company before installing the eavesdropping device.
G: denied, because the threat made by the defendant was a serious crime.
H: granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device.
I: granted, because the defendant was not aware of the eavesdropping device.
J: denied, because the phone booth is a public place with no expectation of privacy.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure and the admissibility of evidence obtained through eavesdropping. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that the police received information from a reliable informant about a defendant planning to extort money. The informant gave specific details: the defendant would use a public phone booth on a certain street corner at a particular date and time. Without notifying the telephone company or getting a warrant, the police installed an eavesdropping device on the public phone. When the defendant called as predicted, he made threats and gave details about the payoff. The police then arrested him using the taped conversation as evidence. Now, the defendant's attorney is moving to exclude this tape from evidence.

The question is whether the defense motion should be granted or denied, with options from A to J.

First, I need to recall the relevant laws regarding wiretapping and eavesdropping. I remember that under the Fourth Amendment, the government generally needs a warrant to conduct eavesdropping unless an exception applies. One key exception is when the surveillance is conducted in a place where the individual doesn't have a reasonable expectation of privacy.

In this case, the phone booth is a public one. I think there's a famous case, Katz v. United States, where the Supreme Court held that the government's use of a wiretap on a public phone booth constituted a search under the Fourth Amendment because the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy when making the call. Wait, but Katz was decided in 1967, right? So in that case, the Court ruled that even though it's a public phone booth, the person using it to make a call has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Therefore, the police would need a warrant to tap that phone.

But wait, in some situations, like if it's an open area or if someone is in a public place where others can overhear, maybe the expectation of privacy is less. But in Katz, the Court specifically said that using a phone booth creates a reasonable expectation of privacy because you're closing the door, for example, to make a private call.

So in this problem, the police installed an eavesdropping device without a warrant. So that would be a problem under Katz because they didn't get a warrant, and the defendant did have a reasonable expectation of privacy in that public phone booth.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Some more recent cases or exceptions? I think there's an exception for public places where there's no expectation of privacy. But again, Katz says that a phone booth is different because you're inside it, making a call, expecting privacy.

So the police didn't get a warrant. They relied on the informant's tip. The question is whether that's sufficient. I think probable cause is needed for a warrant, but without a warrant, unless an exception applies, the evidence would be inadmissible.

Looking at the options, the main issue is whether the police's actions were lawful. If they needed a warrant but didn't get one, the evidence should be excluded.

Option A says the motion should be granted because the police should have obtained a court order (warrant) before recording. That aligns with Katz because they needed a warrant.

Option H says granted because no warrant was secured. That also seems correct.

Wait, but some options talk about expectation of privacy. Option C says denied because the defendant didn't have a reasonable expectation of privacy. But Katz says he does in a phone booth. So C would be incorrect.

Option J says denied because it's a public place. But again, Katz says that even in a public phone booth, there's an expectation of privacy when making a call. So J is wrong.

Option B says denied because police had probable cause. But probable cause alone isn't enough without a warrant, unless an exception applies. Since they didn't get a warrant, and no exception seems to apply here (like exigent circumstances), B is wrong.

Option E says denied because the info was reliable and specific. But again, that's about probable cause, not the warrant requirement. So E isn't the right reason.

Option G says denied because the threat was a serious crime. The seriousness doesn't negate the warrant requirement unless there's an emergency, which isn't mentioned here. So G is wrong.

Option D says granted because police didn't inform defendant. I don't think that's the main issue; it's more about the warrant and expectation of privacy. So D is probably incorrect.

Option F says granted because they didn't get telephone company approval. I don't think that's a requirement for a warrant. The police might need the company's assistance, but the main issue is the warrant. So F might not be the right reason.

Option I says granted because defendant wasn't aware. That's not directly relevant; it's about the legality of the police's actions, not the defendant's knowledge.

So the main options are A, H, and possibly C or J. But since Katz establishes that a phone booth call is protected, the police needed a warrant. So the evidence should be suppressed because the warrantless eavesdropping was unconstitutional.

So the correct answer should be either A or H. Let me check the options again.

Option A: granted because police should have obtained a court order (warrant) before recording. Correct.

Option H: granted because police didn't secure a warrant. Also correct.

Wait, but in the scenario, the police didn't notify the telephone company or seek a warrant. So both A and H are similar. Let me think about the exact legal requirements.

Under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, which governs wiretaps, the police generally need to obtain a warrant from a court. The warrant requires probable cause, among other things. So without the warrant, the evidence is inadmissible unless an exception applies.

In this case, the police didn't get a warrant, and I don't see any exception mentioned. So A and H are both correct in stating that the motion should be granted because no warrant was obtained.

Wait, but looking at the options, both A and H say the same thing in different words. So I need to see if any other options could be correct. But looking back, I think the correct answer is either A or H.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about the defendant's motion to exclude the evidence. The defense argues that the evidence was obtained illegally. The prosecution would argue that there's no expectation of privacy or that they had probable cause. But under Katz, the defendant does have an expectation of privacy in a public phone booth, so the evidence should be excluded unless the police had a warrant.

So the correct answer would be that the motion should be granted because the police didn't get a warrant. So both A and H are making that point. But looking at the options, perhaps both A and H are correct, but only one is an option.

Wait, the options are mutually exclusive. So I need to pick the best answer.

Option A says the police should have obtained a court order before recording. Option H says they didn't secure a warrant before installing the device.

Wait, but the police installed the eavesdropping device without a warrant. So the correct reasoning is that a warrant was needed, so the evidence is inadmissible. So both A and H seem correct, but perhaps the answer is H.

Wait, but maybe there's a nuance. Option C says denied because no reasonable expectation of privacy. But Katz says there is, so C is wrong.

So the correct answer is that the motion should be granted because the police didn't get a warrant, which is option A or H.

Wait, but let me think again. In Katz, the Supreme Court held that the police's actions constituted an unlawful search because they didn't have a warrant. So the evidence would be suppressed.

So in this case, the police didn't get a warrant, so the evidence is inadmissible. So the correct answer is either A or H.

Looking at the options, the question is about the defendant's motion to exclude. The defense is arguing that the evidence was obtained unlawfully.

So the correct answer is that the motion should be granted because the police didn't obtain a warrant. So the options are A and H.

But let me double-check the options.

Option A: granted, because the police should have obtained a court order before recording.

Option H: granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device.

Both are correct statements, but perhaps the more precise answer is H, as it specifically mentions the warrant.

Alternatively, perhaps the telephone booth is a public place, so no expectation of privacy. But Katz says that's not the case.

Wait, but in Katz, the Court said that the government's intrusion was a search because it violated the defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy. So the evidence should be excluded because the police didn't get a warrant.

Thus, the correct answer is either A or H. But looking at the options, the answer is either A or H.

But then, I'm trying to remember if the police can use an informant's tip as probable cause without a warrant.

Wait, another angle: under the Fourth Amendment, a warrant is generally required for wiretaps, with some exceptions. But in this case, the police didn't get a warrant, so unless an exception applies, the evidence is inadmissible.

But wait, the police had probable cause based on the reliable informant. However, probable cause alone doesn't suffice; they still need a warrant unless an exception applies.

So without a warrant, the evidence is inadmissible, so the motion should be granted.

So the correct answer would be either A or H.

But looking again, the options are:

A: granted, because the police should have obtained a court order before recording.

H: granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device.

So both A and H seem correct, but perhaps the answer is H.

Wait, but maybe the correct answer is C: denied because no reasonable expectation of privacy. But Katz says that's not true.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is J: denied because it's a public place. But again, Katz says that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is that the motion should be granted because the police didn't obtain a warrant, making the evidence inadmissible. So the answer is either A or H. But looking at the options, perhaps the answer is H.

Wait, but let me think about the specific law. Under 18 U.S.C. § 2511, which is part of Title III, the police must obtain a warrant to intercept wire or oral communications unless an exception applies. The exceptions include cases where one party consents, or in cases of emergencies.

In this scenario, the police didn't get a warrant, and there's no mention of an exception. Therefore, the interception was unlawful, and the evidence should be suppressed.

So the reason the motion should be granted is that the police didn't obtain a warrant. So the correct answer is either A or H.

Wait, but the options are:

A: granted, because the police should have obtained a court order before recording.

H: granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device.

So both are correct, but perhaps the answer is H because it's more specific about the warrant.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A because it mentions a court order, which is the same as a warrant.

Wait, but I think both A and H are correct, but perhaps the answer is A. Or maybe the answer is H.

But wait, in the scenario, the police didn't notify the telephone company or seek a warrant. So the issue is the lack of a warrant, making the evidence inadmissible.

So the correct answer is either A or H. But since both options are about the warrant, perhaps the intended answer is H.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C, but no, because Katz says there's an expectation of privacy.

Wait, but maybe the answer is J: denied because it's a public place with no expectation of privacy. But Katz says that's incorrect. So J is wrong.

So the answer must be either A or H.

But I'm a bit stuck between them. Let me try to think of it differently. The issue is that the police didn't get a warrant, which is required under Katz. So the answer should be that the motion is granted because they needed a warrant but didn't get one.

So the options are A and H.

I think the correct answer is H: granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device.

But wait, let me check the exact options again.

Option A: granted, because the police should have obtained a court order before recording.

Option H: granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device.

So both are correct, but perhaps the answer is H because it's more specific about the warrant.

Wait, but in the scenario, the police didn't seek a warrant. So the correct answer is H.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another way to approach this: which option correctly states the reason for granting the motion.

The reason is that the police conducted an unlawful search by not obtaining a warrant, as they should have under Katz. So the answer is either A or H.

I think the answer is H.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence obtained through warrantless eavesdropping on a public phone booth. The police, acting on a reliable informant's tip, installed an eavesdropping device without obtaining a warrant or notifying the telephone company. The defendant's attorney moves to exclude the taped conversation as evidence, arguing it was obtained unlawfully.

Under the Fourth Amendment, as established by *Katz v. United States*, a person using a public phone booth has a reasonable expectation of privacy when making a call. Therefore, the police generally need a warrant to intercept such communications. While the informant's tip provided probable cause, probable cause alone does not suffice without a warrant unless an exception applies. No exceptions, such as exigent circumstances, are mentioned in the scenario. Thus, the warrantless eavesdropping was unconstitutional, and the evidence should be excluded.

Option A correctly states that the police should have obtained a court order (warrant) before recording the conversation. Option H similarly emphasizes the lack of a warrant as the reason for granting the motion. Both options are accurate, but H is more specific about the absence of a warrant, which is the central issue in this case.

Other options are incorrect because:
- **C** and **J** incorrectly claim the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy, which contradicts *Katz*.
- **B**, **E**, and **G** focus on probable cause or the seriousness of the crime, which do not negate the warrant requirement.
- **D** and **I** incorrectly focus on the defendant's awareness of the eavesdropping, which is irrelevant to the legality of the police's actions.
- **F** incorrectly suggests that notifying the telephone company is the key issue, but the primary concern is the lack of a warrant.

The correct answer is **H**, as it directly addresses the absence of a warrant, which is the critical factor in this case.

Answer: H
