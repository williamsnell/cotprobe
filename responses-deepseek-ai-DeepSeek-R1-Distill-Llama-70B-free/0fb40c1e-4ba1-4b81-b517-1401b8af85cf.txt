Okay, so I've got this problem about a DC shunt motor, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what each part is asking.

Starting with part (i), they want me to calculate the starting current and the percent of full load. The motor is 120 V DC, armature resistance is 0.2 ohms, and brush voltage drop is 2 V. The rated full-load armature current is 75 A.

Hmm, right. For a DC motor, at starting, the armature current is high because the back emf (counter-emf) is zero initially. So the starting current is determined by the applied voltage minus the brush drop divided by the armature resistance.

Wait, the formula I remember is I = (V - brush drop) / R_armature. Because when the motor starts, the speed is zero, so the back emf is zero. So the initial current is (V - V_brush) / R_a.

So plugging in the numbers: V is 120 V, brush drop is 2 V. So (120 - 2) = 118 V. Armature resistance is 0.2 ohms. So I_start = 118 / 0.2 = 590 A.

Wait, wait a second. Or is the brush drop subtracted? Because I've heard that the brush drop is a voltage that's effectively in series with the armature, so it's part of the voltage that gets dropped, so the available voltage for the armature is V - brush drop. So yes, that's correct.

So the starting current is 590 A.

Now, the question also asks for the percent of full load. The rated full load current is 75 A. So percent is (590 /75)*100.

Calculating that: 75 * 7 = 525, 75*7.8=585, which is 75*7.8=585, so 590 is 75*7.866... So 590/75 = approx 7.8667, which is 786.67%. Let me check that division again. 75 times 7 is 525, subtract that from 590, 65 left. 75 goes into 65 about 0.866 times. So yes, 7.86666... so 786.67 percent.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, some have 786 percent, others 790, etc. Let me see.

Now part (i) is done. So the starting current is 590 A, and 786.67% of full load.

Moving on to part (ii) (a): They want the starting resistance to limit the current to 150% rated load. Rated load is 75 A, so 150% is 112.5 A.

So the starting current with resistance R is (V - brush drop) / (R + R_armature) = 112.5 A.

So (120 - 2) = 118 V. So 118 / (R + 0.2) = 112.5.

Solving for R + 0.2 = 118 / 112.5.

Let me calculate 118 / 112.5. 112.5 is 225/2, so 118 * 2 = 236. 236 / 225 = approx 1.0489 ohms.

So R + 0.2 = 1.0489. Therefore, R = 1.0489 - 0.2 = 0.8489 ohms, approximately 0.849 ohms.

Alternatively, maybe more accurately. Let me compute 118 divided by 112.5:

112.5 * 1 = 112.5, 112.5 * 1.04 = 112.5 + (112.5 * 0.04) = 112.5 +4.5=117. So 1.04 gives 117, which is 1 V less than 118. So 1.04 + (1/112.5) per 1 V. Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as 118 /112.5 = (approx) 1.04 + (1/112.5) since 112.5 * 1.04 = 117. So 118-117=1, so 1/112.5=0.00888... So 1.04 + 0.00888 = ~1.04888. So R = 1.04888 - 0.2=0.84888 ohms, so approximately 0.849 ohms.

Looking at the options, for part (ii)(a), the first value after (i) is the tap resistance, so for (a) it's 0.85 ohms in option J. But let me check the options.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option J: Current (i) 590 A, 786 percent (matches part (i)), then for (ii)(a), tap resistance is 0.85 ohms. Let me see other options. Option D has 0.86, J has 0.85, H has 0.83, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me check again.

Wait, 118 divided by 112.5 equals 1.04888? Let me compute it more accurately.

118 / 112.5 = ?

Well, 112.5 × 1 = 112.5 → subtract, 5.5 left.

5.5 /112.5 = 0.04888... So yes, 1.04888.

So R = 1.04888 - 0.2 = 0.84888, which is approximately 0.849 ohms. So which option has 0.85 for part (a) of (ii)?

Looking at the options:

Option J: (a) 0.85 ohms.

Option D: (a) 0.86.

So J's (a) is 0.85, which is about what I have. So that's a possible candidate.

Wait, but let's proceed to part (ii)(b): Now, the current is to be limited to 150% of rated load when the counter-emf is 25% of armature voltage.

Wait, the counter-emf (back emf) is E_b = K * ω, but at this point, the motor is running at some speed where E_b is 25% of V (120 V). So E_b = 0.25 * 120 = 30 V.

So when the motor is running, the armature voltage is V - E_b - brush drop? Or is it V = E_b + I_a * R_a + brush drop?

Wait, the correct equation is V = E_b + I_a * R_a + brush drop.

Wait, no, no. Let me think again. The applied voltage V is connected across the armature, which has a resistance R_a, and the back emf E_b. So the voltage equation is V = E_b + I_a * R_a + brush drop. Because the armature current I_a flows through R_a, causing a voltage drop I_a * R_a. Additionally, the brush drop (V_brush) is a fixed voltage. So the equation is:

V = E_b + I_a * R_a + V_brush.

But sometimes, the brush drop is considered as a part of the armature resistance voltage, but perhaps that's a detail. Alternatively, some might model it as E_b = V - I_a (R_a + R_ext) - V_brush.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to re-derive. The armature circuit has the supply voltage V, and in series with it, the armature resistance R_a, and any external starting resistance R. The back emf E_b opposes the applied voltage.

So the equation is E_b = V - I_a (R_a + R) - V_brush.

Wait no, that can't be right because when the motor is running, the back emf is E_b = (V - I_a (R_a + R) - V_brush). Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the correct equation is:

At any condition, the armature current is I_a = (V - E_b - V_brush) / (R_a + R).

In this case, for part (ii)(b), R is the starting resistance, and E_b is 25% V, which is 30 V.

So the current I_a is 150% of 75 A, which is 112.5 A.

So 112.5 = (120 - 30 - 2) / (0.2 + R).

Because E_b is 30 V, V_brush is 2 V.

So numerator is 120 -30 -2 = 88 V.

So 88 = (0.2 + R) * 112.5.

So 0.2 + R = 88 / 112.5 = approximately 0.78222... Ohms.

So R = 0.78222 - 0.2 = 0.58222 Ohms. So approximately 0.582 Ω.

Looking at the options, for part (ii)(b), the second tap is around 0.58 Ω.

Looking at the options, option J has 0.582 Ω for (ii)(b), which matches.

Now part (ii)(c): The current is to be limited to 150% (112.5 A) when the counter emf is 50% of V_a. So E_b is 50% of 120 V, which is 60 V.

Again, using the equation:

I_a = (V - E_b - V_brush) / (R_a + R).

So 112.5 A = (120 -60 -2) / (0.2 + R).

So numerator is 58 V.

So 58 = (0.2 + R)*112.5.

0.2 + R = 58 / 112.5 = approximately 0.5155... Ohms.

So R = 0.5155 - 0.2 = 0.3155 Ω, approximately 0.316 Ω.

Looking at the options, for part (c), option J has 0.316 Ω. So that matches.

Now part (iii): Find the counter emf at full load, without starting resistance.

Full load current is 75 A. So the back emf E_b is equal to V - I_a R_a - V_brush.

Wait, using the equation V = E_b + I_a R_a + V_brush.

So E_b = V - I_a R_a - V_brush.

So E_b = 120 - (75 * 0.2) - 2 = 120 - 15 - 2 = 103 V.

Looking at the options, part (iii) in option J is 103 V. So that matches.

Putting it all together: from part (i), we have starting current 590 A, 786.67% of full load. Part (ii)(a) requires R = 0.85 Ω, (ii)(b) R=0.582, (ii)(c) R=0.316, and (iii) E_b=103 V.

Looking at the options, option J has:

i: 590 A, 786% 

ii a: 0.85, b: 0.582, c:0.316 

iii:103 V.

So option J seems to match all the calculated values.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze each part systematically:

### Part (i)
The starting current of the motor is calculated using the formula:

\[
I_{\text{start}} = \frac{V - V_{\text{brush}}}{R_{\text{armature}}}
\]

Given \( V = 120 \, \text{V} \), \( V_{\text{brush}} = 2 \, \text{V} \), and \( R_{\text{armature}} = 0.2 \, \Omega \):

\[
I_{\text{start}} = \frac{120 - 2}{0.2} = \frac{118}{0.2} = 590 \, \text{A}
\]

The percent of full load is calculated as:

\[
\text{Percent of full load} = \frac{I_{\text{start}}}{I_{\text{full-load}}} \times 100 = \frac{590}{75} \times 100 \approx 786.67\%
\]

### Part (ii)(a)
To limit the starting current to 150% of the rated load (\( 112.5 \, \text{A} \)), the required starting resistance \( R \) is calculated using:

\[
I_{\text{start}} = \frac{V - V_{\text{brush}}}{R + R_{\text{armature}}}
\]

Rearranging for \( R \):

\[
R + R_{\text{armature}} = \frac{V - V_{\text{brush}}}{I_{\text{start}}}
\]

Substituting \( V = 120 \, \text{V} \), \( V_{\text{brush}} = 2 \, \text{V} \), \( I_{\text{start}} = 112.5 \, \text{A} \), and \( R_{\text{armature}} = 0.2 \, \Omega \):

\[
R + 0.2 = \frac{120 - 2}{112.5} = \frac{118}{112.5} \approx 1.0489
\]

\[
R = 1.0489 - 0.2 \approx 0.849 \, \Omega
\]

### Part (ii)(b)
When the counter-emf (\( E_b \)) is 25% of the armature voltage (\( V_a \)), \( E_b = 0.25 \times 120 = 30 \, \text{V} \). The current is limited to \( 112.5 \, \text{A} \). Using the voltage equation:

\[
V = E_b + I_a (R_{\text{armature}} + R) + V_{\text{brush}}
\]

Rearranging for \( R \):

\[
R_{\text{armature}} + R = \frac{V - E_b - V_{\text{brush}}}{I_a}
\]

Substituting \( V = 120 \, \text{V} \), \( E_b = 30 \, \text{V} \), \( V_{\text{brush}} = 2 \, \text{V} \), \( I_a = 112.5 \, \text{A} \), and \( R_{\text{armature}} = 0.2 \, \Omega \):

\[
0.2 + R = \frac{120 - 30 - 2}{112.5} = \frac{88}{112.5} \approx 0.7822
\]

\[
R = 0.7822 - 0.2 \approx 0.582 \, \Omega
\]

### Part (ii)(c)
When the counter-emf (\( E_b \)) is 50% of the armature voltage (\( V_a \)), \( E_b = 0.5 \times 120 = 60 \, \text{V} \). The current is limited to \( 112.5 \, \text{A} \). Using the same approach:

\[
R_{\text{armature}} + R = \frac{V - E_b - V_{\text{brush}}}{I_a}
\]

Substituting \( V = 120 \, \text{V} \), \( E_b = 60 \, \text{V} \), \( V_{\text{brush}} = 2 \, \text{V} \), \( I_a = 112.5 \, \text{A} \), and \( R_{\text{armature}} = 0.2 \, \Omega \):

\[
0.2 + R = \frac{120 - 60 - 2}{112.5} = \frac{58}{112.5} \approx 0.5155
\]

\[
R = 0.5155 - 0.2 \approx 0.316 \, \Omega
\]

### Part (iii)
The counter-emf at full load is calculated using:

\[
E_b = V - I_{\text{full-load}} R_{\text{armature}} - V_{\text{brush}}
\]

Substituting \( V = 120 \, \text{V} \), \( I_{\text{full-load}} = 75 \, \text{A} \), \( R_{\text{armature}} = 0.2 \, \Omega \), and \( V_{\text{brush}} = 2 \, \text{V} \):

\[
E_b = 120 - (75 \times 0.2) - 2 = 120 - 15 - 2 = 103 \, \text{V}
\]

### Final Answer
The calculations match the values in **Option J**:

- (i) Starting current: \( 590 \, \text{A} \), Percent of full load: \( 786\% \)
- (ii)(a) Starting resistance: \( 0.85 \, \Omega \)
- (ii)(b) Starting resistance: \( 0.582 \, \Omega \)
- (ii)(c) Starting resistance: \( 0.316 \, \Omega \)
- (iii) Counter-emf at full load: \( 103 \, \text{V} \)
