Okay, so I've got this tax question here about S corporations and shareholder contributions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

So the question is: The sole shareholder of an S corporation contributed equipment with a fair market value of $20,000 and a basis of $6,000, and this equipment is subject to a $12,000 liability. They're asking what gain, if any, the shareholder must recognize.

Wait, I remember that when a shareholder contributes property to a corporation, there are some tax implications. I think the general rule is that contributions are not taxable to the shareholder because it's like exchanging property for stock, but there might be exceptions, especially when there's debt involved.

So, the key points here are:
1. It's an S corporation, so some rules might differ from C corporations, but I think the basic contribution rules are similar.
2. The property has a FMV of $20k, but the shareholder's basis is $6k. Oh, and there's a liability of $12k attached to the equipment.

Wait, so the shareholder is transferring this equipment to the S corporation, but the equipment is subject to a liability. So the corporation assumes that liability, I suppose.

I think the gain is calculated based on the difference between the FMV and the basis, but when there's debt involved. So generally, when you contribute property with debt, the gain is the excess of the FMV over the basis, minus the debt. Or wait, is the gain FMV minus basis, but not less than the debt?

Wait, let me recall. When a shareholder contributes property to a corporation, if the property's FMV is greater than the basis, the shareholder recognizes gain. But if there's debt on the property, that might reduce the taxable gain. The formula I think is: Gain = FMV - Basis + Debt Relief. Or wait, no, the debt is subtracted from the FMV?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. If the property is subject to a liability, the transfer of the property to the corporation includes the assumption of that liability. So the total consideration the shareholder receives is the FMV minus the debt, right? Because the corporation takes over the debt, so the effective value the shareholder gets is FMV minus debt.

So the gain would be the amount by which FMV minus debt exceeds the basis. So Gain = (FMV - Debt) - Basis.

In this case, FMV is $20k, Debt is $12k, Basis is $6k.

So let's compute that: 20,000 -12,000 = 8,000. Then subtract the basis: 8,000 -6,000 = 2,000. Wait, but that's not one of the options given. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is FMV minus basis, but not less than the debt. So the gain is the lesser of (FMV - Basis) or the debt.

Wait, FMV - Basis is 20k -6k=14k. The debt is 12k. So the gain would be 12k in that case. But wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I think the correct rule is that when a shareholder contributes property with a liability, the gain is the excess of the FMV over the basis, but only up to the amount of the liability. So if FMV is higher than the basis by 14k, and the debt is 12k, then the gain is 12k, because the liability can shelter that part.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to remember the rule. I think in general, when you transfer property subject to a liability, the taxable gain is FMV - basis, but the gain can't exceed the liability. So if FMV is 20k, basis is 6k, the difference is 14k. But the liability is 12k, so the gain is 12k. Because the corporation assumes 12k of debt, which is treated as money received by the shareholder, so the gain is 12k.

Wait, but another approach I've heard is that the gain is the amount by which FMV exceeds the basis, but then you subtract the debt because the corporation is taking on that debt, which is treated as boot. Or maybe the gain is FMV minus basis minus debt. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about it in terms of the shareholder's perspective. The shareholder is giving the corporation equipment worth 20k, but the corporation also takes over a 12k liability. So effectively, the shareholder is contributing 8k in value (20k -12k=8k). The basis in the equipment was 6k, so the gain would be 8k -6k=2k. But that's not one of the options either. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the gain is the excess of FMV over basis, but the debt is treated as a liability assumed by the corporation, which is considered as proceeds to the shareholder. So the shareholder's gain is FMV minus basis, but the debt is subtracted from the FMV because it's a liability the corporation is taking on.

So Gain = FMV - Debt - Basis. So 20k -12k=8k, 8k -6k=2k. Again, that's not an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps the gain is the FMV - basis, but if the FMV is higher than the basis plus the debt, then the gain is FMV - (basis + debt). But wait, that would be 20k - (6k +12k)=2k. Again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the rules. Let me try to recall the exact tax rule. Under IRC section 357, when a shareholder transfers property to a corporation and the corporation assumes a liability, the transfer may result in taxable gain. The gain is the amount by which the sum of the liabilities assumed exceeds the shareholder's basis in the property, but only if the FMV is greater than the basis.

Wait, no, I think it's that when the corporation assumes a liability, the shareholder is treated as receiving the amount of the liability as boot, so the gain is the excess of the FMV over the basis, but the gain is recognized only up to the amount of the liability if the FMV exceeds the basis by more than the liability.

Wait, let me think again. When you transfer property subject to a liability:

- If the FMV of the property is greater than the basis, the shareholder recognizes gain equal to the lesser of (FMV - Basis) or the liability.

So for example, if FMV is 20k, basis 6k, liability 12k. The excess is 14k. Since the liability is 12k, which is less than 14k, the gain is 12k.

But wait, another source I remember says that the gain is FMV minus basis, but if the FMV is less than the basis, there's no gain. If FMV is greater than basis, then the gain is FMV minus basis minus the debt, but not below zero.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to look up the rule in my mind.

Ah, I think the correct approach is that the gain is the amount by which the FMV exceeds the basis, but the gain cannot exceed the amount of the liability. So if FMV is 20k, basis 6k, the excess is 14k. The liability is 12k, so the gain is 12k.

So in this case, the shareholder must recognize gain of $12,000. Looking at the options, option D is $12,000.

Wait, but another possibility is that the gain is the FMV minus the basis, but when the corporation assumes a liability, the gain is the FMV minus the basis, and the debt is treated as a distribution, which might affect the basis in the stock. But in this case, since it's an S corporation and the shareholder is the sole shareholder, perhaps the gain is just recognized as per the general rule.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that when a shareholder contributes property to their corporation, the general rule is that no gain is recognized if the FMV is less than or equal to the basis. If FMV is higher than the basis, then gain is recognized, but the debt reduces the FMV by the amount of the debt.

So, FMV of the property is 20k, but the debt is 12k, so the net FMV is 8k. If the basis is 6k, then the gain is 8k -6k=2k. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, but maybe the correct formula is that the gain is the amount of the liability in excess of the basis. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the gain is the FMV minus the basis, but the debt is subtracted from the FMV, so the gain is (20k -12k) -6k=2k. Again, not matching options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the basic rule again. When a shareholder contributes property to a corporation, the shareholder recognizes gain on the transfer if the FMV of the property exceeds the basis. However, if the property is subject to a liability, the amount of gain is the lesser of (FMV - basis) or the liability.

So in this case, FMV - basis is 14k, and the liability is 12k, so the gain is 12k.

Therefore, the correct answer would be D: $12,000.
</think>

When a shareholder contributes property to an S corporation, the tax implications depend on the relationship between the property's fair market value (FMV), the shareholder's basis in the property, and any liabilities associated with the property. In this case:

- **FMV of the equipment**: $20,000  
- **Shareholder's basis**: $6,000  
- **Liability attached to the equipment**: $12,000  

The general rule is that the shareholder recognizes gain on the transfer if the FMV of the property exceeds the basis. However, when the property is subject to a liability, the gain is limited to the lesser of the excess of FMV over basis or the amount of the liability.

1. **Calculate the excess of FMV over basis**:  
   \[
   \text{FMV} - \text{Basis} = \$20,000 - \$6,000 = \$14,000
   \]

2. **Determine the gain**:  
   Since the liability ($12,000) is less than the excess of FMV over basis ($14,000), the gain is limited to the amount of the liability. Therefore, the shareholder recognizes a gain of $12,000.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D: $12,000**
