Question:

A woman was hired by a restaurant as a cashier under an at-will employment contract. On the woman's first day at work, she noticed a sign in the kitchen area that read:"IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL EMPLOYEESEmployees are not permitted to smoke during working hours. Any employee who is found to be in violation of this policy will be fined $50 for the first offense; $100 for the second offense; and fired for the third violation. "The woman, who was a smoker, read the notice, but did not object or make any comment regarding the restaurant's nonsmoking policy. For six months, the woman worked at the restaurant and never smoked during business hours. One afternoon, the woman was working when an armed robber stormed into the restaurant. He pointed a pistol at the woman and demanded all the money from the cash register. Frightened and panic stricken, the woman handed over the money and then collapsed. Moments later, she regained consciousness and then smoked a cigarette while she regained her composure. Thereafter, the woman resumed her duties for the rest of the day. The next week, however, when the woman received her pay check, she noticed that the restaurant had deducted $50 from her check. A note was attached indicating that the woman was being fined for smoking during business hours. Although the woman protested, the restaurant refused to make any waiver and stood by its policy. In an action by the woman against the restaurant to recover the $50, which of the following is the best argument in the woman's favor?

Options:

A: The woman was not given a warning before the fine was implemented, which goes against standard disciplinary procedures.
B: The woman was not properly informed of the nonsmoking policy upon her hire, rendering the fine invalid.
C: The nonsmoking provision concerning disciplinary action is unenforceable, because it attempts to impose a penalty instead of reasonably liquidating the damages, if any, sustained by the restaurant.
D: The restaurant's nonsmoking policy violates the woman's right to smoke, which is protected under the law.
E: The nonsmoking provision is discriminatory as it does not take into account the personal habits or needs of the employees.
F: The restaurant violated the woman's rights by imposing a fine without giving her a chance to defend herself.
G: The restaurant impliedly waived the nonsmoking provision by permitting the woman to continue working for the rest of the day.
H: The restaurant's nonsmoking policy concerned a collateral matter that was not incorporated within the terms of their employment contract.
I: The nonsmoking provision constituted a constructive condition subsequent that was excused because of temporary impracticability.

Okay, so I need to figure out the best argument the woman can make against the restaurant deducting $50 from her paycheck for smoking during business hours. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

The woman was hired as a cashier under an at-will employment contract. On her first day, she saw a sign in the kitchen that prohibited smoking during working hours. The policy had penalties: $50 for the first offense, $100 for the second, and termination for the third. She didn't object to this policy and didn't smoke during work for six months. 

Then, during an armed robbery, she was so frightened that she collapsed, then when she came to, she smoked a cigarette to calm down. The restaurant fined her $50, and she's disputing that.

So the question is about employment law, specifically the enforceability of such workplace policies and penalties.

The options are A through I, each presenting a different legal argument.

First, I need to recall that in at-will employment, the employer can generally terminate the employee for any reason, as long as it's not illegal. But here, the issue isn't termination; it's a fine. So the question is whether the employer can impose such a penalty.

I remember that contracts can't impose penalties, only liquidated damages which are reasonable estimates of actual damages. A penalty is a sum that's designed to punish rather than compensate. So if the employer's policy is a penalty, it might not be enforceable.

Looking at the options, option C says the nonsmoking provision is unenforceable because it's a penalty, not a reasonable liquidation of damages. That seems relevant. The restaurant is deducting money without showing actual harm, so it's punitive.

Other options: 

A says she wasn't given a warning, but the policy clearly states the fines, so maybe she was aware. 

B claims she wasn't properly informed, but she read the notice on her first day.

D argues a right to smoke, but I don't think smoking is a protected right in the workplace; employers can typically ban it.

E suggests discrimination based on personal habits, but the policy applies to all employees, so it's not discriminatory unless it targets a protected class.

F is about not giving her a chance to defend herself, but at-will employment might not require that unless there's a contract provision.

G says the restaurant waived the policy by letting her continue working. That's possible, but it's more about whether the waiver applies. If they didn't explicitly waive it and just let her work, maybe not.

H claims the policy wasn't part of the employment contract. The sign was in the kitchen, but the employment was at-will, so perhaps the policy was a term she agreed to by working there.

I talks about constructive conditions and impracticability. The robbery made it impossible for her to comply, so maybe the condition was excused. That could be another angle, but I'm not as sure about that.

So the strongest argument seems to be that the fine is a penalty, not liquidated damages. If the restaurant can't show actual damages from her smoking, then the fine is unenforceable. So option C would be the best argument.

The best argument for the woman is that the nonsmoking provision imposes a penalty rather than liquidated damages. Since the restaurant cannot demonstrate actual harm from her smoking, the $50 fine is punitive and unenforceable under contract law principles. 

Answer: C
