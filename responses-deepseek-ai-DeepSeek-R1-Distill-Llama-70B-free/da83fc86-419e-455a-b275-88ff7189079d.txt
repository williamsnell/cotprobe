Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Articles of Confederation, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Articles. I remember that the Articles were the first constitution of the United States, in effect from 1781 until 1789 when the current Constitution took over. They established a very weak central government, with most of the power resting with the states.

The question is asking which power the national government had under the Articles. The options are A through G. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Abolish state governments. Hmm, that seems unlikely. The Articles were all about state sovereignty, right? Each state was like its own entity, so the national government couldn't just get rid of them. I don't think the national government had that power.

Option B: Regulate interstate commerce. Wait, I remember something about this. Under the Articles, the federal government couldn't regulate trade between states. That was a big issue that led to the Constitutional Convention, like why they needed a stronger central government. So B is probably not correct because they couldn't regulate interstate commerce.

Option C: Establish a federal judiciary. The Articles didn't have a separate judicial branch. I think the national government under the Articles had no Supreme Court or federal courts. So C doesn't seem right.

Option D: Negotiate treaties. Now, this rings a bell. The Articles did give the national government the authority to handle foreign affairs, including making treaties with other countries. So D might be the correct answer.

Option E: Enforce its laws. Oh right, the national government under the Articles couldn't enforce laws. They had to rely on the states to do that, which was a major weakness. So E is not correct.

Option F: Directly elect the President. Wait, there was no President under the Articles. The Articles had a confederation with a weak executive, if any. The presidency was a creation of the later Constitution, so F is out.

Option G: Implement a federal education system. No way, I don't think the federal government had any role in education under the Articles. Education was a state matter, so G is not correct.

So putting it all together, the national government could negotiate treaties. That leaves D as the correct answer.

The correct answer is D: negotiate treaties.

Under the Articles of Confederation, the national government was granted the authority to handle foreign affairs, including the negotiation of treaties with other countries. This was one of the few significant powers the central government held, as the Articles emphasized state sovereignty and a weak federal structure. Other options, such as regulating interstate commerce or enforcing laws, were beyond the scope of the national government's powers under the Articles.

Answer: D
