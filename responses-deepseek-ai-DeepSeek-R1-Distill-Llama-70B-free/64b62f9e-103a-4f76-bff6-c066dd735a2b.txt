Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about echoes and sound. Hmm, let me think about it. The question says that a sound is returned as an echo in 4 seconds, and I need to find how far away the cliff is. The speed of sound is given as 1100 feet per second.

Wait, right, when you hear an echo, that means the sound has traveled to the cliff and then bounced back. So the sound goes there and comes back the same distance. Oh, so the total distance the sound travels is twice the distance to the cliff. Because, like, if the cliff is 100 feet away, sound goes 100 there and 100 back, making 200.

So the time is the total time for the round trip. Time is 4 seconds here. The formula that relates these is distance equals speed multiplied by time. But since the sound goes to the cliff and back, the total distance is 2 times the cliff distance.

Let me write that out. Let me call the distance to the cliff 'd'. So the total distance is 2d. The speed is given as 1100 ft/s, and time is 4 seconds. So according to the formula, distance equals speed multiplied by time. So 2d = 1100 * 4.

Wait, let me calculate that. 1100 multiplied by 4 is... 4400. So 2d equals 4400 feet. Therefore, d is 4400 divided by 2, which is 2200. So the cliff is 2200 feet away.

Looking at the options, option I is 2200 ft. So the answer should be I.

Wait, let me double-check. If the sound goes out and comes back, that's two times the distance. So yeah, 2d = speed*time. So 2d = 4400, so d=2200. Yep, that seems right. So I think I'm confident with that.

To determine the distance to the cliff, we use the fact that the sound travels to the cliff and back, making the total distance traveled by the sound twice the distance to the cliff. The formula for distance is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Here, the total distance traveled by the sound is:

\[
2d = 1100 \, \text{ft/s} \times 4 \, \text{s} = 4400 \, \text{ft}
\]

The distance to the cliff (\(d\)) is half of this:

\[
d = \frac{4400}{2} = 2200 \, \text{ft}
\]

Thus, the cliff is 2200 feet away. The correct answer is:

**I: 2200 ft**

Answer: I
