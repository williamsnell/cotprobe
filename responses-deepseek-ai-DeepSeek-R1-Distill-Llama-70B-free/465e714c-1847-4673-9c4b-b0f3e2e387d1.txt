Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The patient is a 30-year-old nulliparous female, meaning she hasn't had any children. She's been experiencing mood changes over the past several months. Her symptoms include anxiety, hyperactivity, and trouble sleeping, specifically in the 3 to 4 days leading up to her menstrual period. Once her menses start, she becomes acutely depressed, anorectic (which I think means she doesn't want to eat), irritable, and lethargic. She doesn't have any psychiatric history, so this is the first time she's experiencing these issues. Her physical exam is normal, so nothing stands out there. She and her husband have been trying to conceive for over two years, which might be a clue. She had a tuboplasty about a year ago to fix a closed fallopian tube, which I think is related to infertility treatment.

So, the question is asking for the most likely diagnosis from the options provided. Let's look at the options:

A: Generalized anxiety disorder
B: Bipolar I disorder, mixed
C: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder
D: Cyclothymic personality
E: Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)
F: Post-traumatic stress disorder
G: Seasonal affective disorder
H: Bipolar II disorder
I: Adjustment disorder with depressed mood
J: Major depressive disorder

Hmm. I need to match her symptoms to one of these. Let me think about each option.

The key here seems to be the timing of her symptoms. They occur premenstrually and then change once her period starts. So, the symptoms are cyclical, tied to her menstrual cycle.

Generalized anxiety disorder (A) is a possibility because she's anxious. But GAD is more chronic and not tied to the menstrual cycle. It's excessive worry for more days than not for at least six months. Her anxiety seems to be specifically in the premenstrual phase, so that doesn't fit as well.

Bipolar I disorder, mixed (B). Bipolar I involves manic episodes, and mixed episodes have both manic and depressive symptoms. But her symptoms don't mention anything like manic episodes beyond hyperactivity. Plus, the cyclical nature tied to her period suggests something else.

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (C) sounds promising. PMDD is a condition where women experience mood and physical symptoms tied to their menstrual cycle. Symptoms include irritability, anxiety, mood swings, and they get worse right before the period. It sounds like exactly what she's experiencing—premenstrual anxiety and depression that starts after her period begins.

Cyclothymic disorder (D) is a mood disorder with periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms, but it's more chronic and not specifically tied to the menstrual cycle. So that's probably not it.

Persistent depressive disorder (E) is a chronic form of depression lasting two years or more. Her symptoms are cyclical, so this doesn't fit.

PTSD (F) would be related to a traumatic event, which isn't mentioned here, so probably not.

Seasonal affective disorder (G) is related to seasonal changes, like winter depression, but her symptoms are monthly, so no.

Bipolar II disorder (H) involves major depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes. Again, her symptoms don't indicate hypomania beyond hyperactivity, which may not be enough, and the timing is tied to her cycle.

Adjustment disorder (I) is a response to a specific stressor, but she doesn't mention any particular event causing this. She's been trying to conceive, which is a stressor, but her symptoms are more about the cycle than that.

Major depressive disorder (J) is a possibility, but her symptoms are tied to her menstrual cycle and include both premenstrual anxiety and then depression, which seems more specific than MDD.

So, putting it all together, the most likely diagnosis is Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (C). Her symptoms align with the criteria for PMDD, including the timing and the specific mood changes.

The patient is a 30-year-old nulliparous female experiencing mood changes tied to her menstrual cycle. She reports anxiety, hyperactivity, and insomnia in the premenstrual phase, followed by depression, anorexia, irritability, and lethargy upon menstruation. These symptoms are cyclical and align with the diagnostic criteria for Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which involves mood and physical symptoms specifically linked to the menstrual cycle. Other options like generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar disorders, and major depressive disorder do not account for the cyclical nature of her symptoms. 

Answer: C
