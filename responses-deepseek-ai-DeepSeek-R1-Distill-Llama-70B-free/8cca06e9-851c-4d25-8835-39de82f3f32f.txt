Question:

Dan read a list of 30 vocabulary words only once. If he is typical and shows the serial position effect, we would expect that the words he remembers two days later are

Options:

A: at the end of the list
B: words that were repeated in the list
C: the longest words in the list
D: words related to a specific topic
E: the last ten words he read
F: the shortest words in the list
G: at the beginning of the list
H: in the middle of the list
I: distributed throughout the list

Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the serial position effect. Hmm, what do I remember about that? I think the serial position effect has to do with how people remember items in a list based on their position.

So, the question is about Dan reading 30 vocabulary words once. The question asks which words he would remember two days later, considering the serial position effect. The options are A to I, each suggesting different parts or characteristics of the list.

Wait, the serial position effect refers to better recall for items at the beginning and the end of a list, right? I remember something about the primacy effect and the recency effect. The primacy effect is where the first few items are remembered better because they're processed more deeply. The recency effect is the last few items being remembered better because they're still in short-term memory when the list ends.

So in this case, Dan reads the list once. Two days later, the short-term memory would have faded, so the recency effect (remembering the end) might not hold as strong. But wait, the serial position effect still predicts that the beginning and end are better remembered than the middle, even after some time, I think.

Looking at the options: Option A says the end of the list, E says the last ten. G says the beginning. So the question is, which part would he remember? Since it's two days later, perhaps both the beginning and end are better remembered than the middle, but the question is phrased in terms of what we would expect, given the effect.

Wait, but the question says "the words he remembers two days later are..." So considering the passage of time, the recency effect might be weaker because that's more about short-term memory. The primacy effect, being about deeper processing, might last longer. So Dan would remember the beginning better.

But wait, another point: The serial position effect is often observed in immediate recall, but does it hold after a delay? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think the primacy effect is more robust over time because those items were rehearsed more and maybe consolidated into long-term memory. The recency effect diminishes with time because those items were just in short-term memory which fades.

So two days later, the beginning of the list (primacy) would be better remembered than the middle, and the end might not be as strong as they were initially. So the words from the beginning would be what he remembers more.

Looking at the options, G is "at the beginning of the list." So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Option E is "the last ten words he read," which would be the end. So if the question is about the serial position effect, which includes both primacy and recency, but after two days, maybe the beginning is better.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering both effects, but the options G and E are for parts of the list. The question is in present tense: "we would expect that the words he remembers..." So perhaps both the beginning and the end might be remembered, but looking at the options, none of them say both; the options are separate.

Wait, the options are single choices. So which is more likely to be correct? The question is about the serial position effect, which includes both, but the answer choices don't have a combined option. So perhaps the best fit is either G or E.

Wait, but the question is about what he remembers two days later. So if the recency effect fades, then the beginning (primacy) would be better. So the correct answer is G.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking which part he's more likely to remember, considering the effect. The options are G and E, with E being the last ten. Wait, the last few items might be in the longer-term memory if they were rehearsed, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The serial position effect is that the first and last items are better remembered than the middle. So in this case, the question is about two days later. The first items (primacy) are better in long-term recall, while the last items (recency) are better in short-term. So after two days, the first would be better. So the answer is G: at the beginning.

Therefore, the correct answer is G.

The serial position effect refers to the tendency for people to remember items at the beginning (primacy effect) and end (recency effect) of a list better than those in the middle. The primacy effect occurs because the first items are processed more deeply and consolidated into long-term memory, while the recency effect is due to the last items being in short-term memory when the list ends. However, the recency effect diminishes over time as short-term memory fades.

In this scenario, Dan reads a list of 30 vocabulary words once, and the question asks which words he would remember two days later. After two days, the recency effect would weaken, leaving the primacy effect as the dominant factor. Therefore, Dan would be more likely to remember the words at the beginning of the list.

The correct answer is **G: at the beginning of the list**.

G
