Okay, so I have this question about a Poisson process, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what I remember.

The question is asking for the probability of no arrivals in the interval [3,5). The Poisson process has a rate λ of 0.5. Hmm, right, Poisson processes are about events happening continuously and independently at a constant average rate.

I remember that in a Poisson process, the number of events in any interval of length t is Poisson distributed with parameter λt. So if the interval is from time a to time b, the number of events there would be Poisson with λ*(b-a).

In this case, the interval is from t=3 to t=5. So the length of the interval is 5-3=2 units. So λt would be 0.5 * 2 = 1. So the number of arrivals in this interval follows a Poisson distribution with λ=1.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of no arrivals. That's the same as the probability that the Poisson random variable equals zero. The formula for P(k) in Poisson is (λ^k e^{-λ}) / k! So for k=0, it's e^{-λ}.

So substituting λ=1, the probability is e^{-1} which is approximately 0.3679. Let me check, e is about 2.71828, so 1/e is around 0.36788.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.37, which seems to match. So the answer should be H.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The interval is [3,5), which is a closed-open interval, meaning it includes 3 but not 5. But for a Poisson process, whether it's closed or open doesn't matter because the probability of an arrival exactly at a point is zero. So the length is indeed 2, so lambda*t is 1.

Yes, so the probability is e^{-1} ≈ 0.3679, so option H.

The problem involves a Poisson process with rate $\lambda = 0.5$, and we are tasked with finding the probability of no arrivals in the interval $[3, 5)$. 

In a Poisson process, the number of events in any interval of length $t$ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda t$. Here, the interval $[3, 5)$ has a length of $5 - 3 = 2$. Thus, the number of arrivals in this interval is Poisson distributed with $\lambda t = 0.5 \times 2 = 1$.

The probability of no arrivals (i.e., zero events) in a Poisson process is given by $P(0) = e^{-\lambda}$. Substituting $\lambda = 1$, we find $P(0) = e^{-1} \approx 0.3679$. Among the given options, the closest value is $0.37$, which corresponds to option H.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

H: 0.37

Answer: H
