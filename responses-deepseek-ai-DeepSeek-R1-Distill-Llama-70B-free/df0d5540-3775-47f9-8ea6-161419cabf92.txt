Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about Milgram's obedience study and the ethical criticisms it faced. I remember that Milgram's study was pretty controversial, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think through this.

First, what was Milgram's study about? From what I recall, he wanted to see how far people would go in obeying an authority figure, even if it went against their conscience. The setup involved participants acting as teachers who administered electric shocks to learners whenever they answered questions wrong. The twist was that the learners were actually actors, and the real experiment was about the teachers' obedience.

Now, the question is about the ethical criticisms. I think the main issues were related to the treatment of the participants. I remember something about psychological effects. The participants didn't know the learners were faking the pain, so they thought they were actually causing harm. That must have caused a lot of stress or anxiety for them.

Looking at the options:

A: Lack of debriefing. Wait, I think debriefing is when they explain the true nature of the study after. I believe Milgram did debrief his participants, explaining that the shocks weren't real. So A might not be the right answer.

B: Lack of compensation. I don't remember compensation being a big issue here. The study was more about ethics than payment.

C: Violation of anonymity. Anonymity is about keeping participants' identities private. I don't think that was the main issue in Milgram's case.

D: Nonrandom sampling. That's about how participants are selected. I don't recall that being a major ethical criticism of Milgram's study.

E: Physical harm. The participants didn't receive any physical harm themselves. The learners were actors, so no real physical harm was done. But the participants thought they were causing harm, which might relate to psychological impact.

F: Bias in data analysis. I don't think that's the main ethical issue here. The problem was more about how the participants were treated during the study.

G: Risk of psychological harm. This rings a bell. Because the participants were put in a situation where they thought they were harming others, it could lead to psychological distress. So this would be an ethical issue regarding the welfare of the participants.

So putting it all together, the main ethical criticism was about the potential psychological harm to the participants. So the answer should be G.

Milgram's obedience study was criticized primarily on the grounds of risking psychological harm to participants. The participants were led to believe they were administering painful electric shocks, causing significant stress and anxiety, which raised ethical concerns about their welfare.

Answer: G
