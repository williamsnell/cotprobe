Okay, so I've got this problem about steam flowing through a nozzle, and I need to find the velocity at a certain point. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the problem states that superheated steam flows from a boiler. The initial conditions are pressure P = 80 Psia and temperature T = 500°F. The velocity at the boiler is zero. Then, at a point in the nozzle, the pressure is 40 Psia. I need to find the velocity there.

Wait, I remember something about the steady flow energy equation, maybe? Like, for a nozzle, the equation simplifies because there's no work done, no heat transfer, and the potential energy change is negligible. So the equation would be something like h1 + (V1²)/2 = h2 + (V2²)/2.

Oh right, since the velocity V1 is zero (given), the equation simplifies to h1 = h2 + (V2²)/2. So I can rearrange that to solve for V2.

But wait, I need the enthalpy values h1 and h2. I think I need to use steam tables for that. Let me think. h1 is the enthalpy at the initial state (80 Psia, 500°F). h2 is at the exit condition, which is 40 Psia. But what's the temperature at the exit? Oh, because steam is expanding, it's going through a nozzle, so I think it's an isentropic process, but wait, the problem doesn't specify that. Hmm. Or maybe it's just steady flow without considering entropy?

Wait, no, the problem doesn't mention anything about it being isentropic. So maybe I should assume it's a steady flow process but not necessarily isentropic. Wait, but without knowing if it's reversible or not, how can I determine the exit enthalpy? Hmm. I'm a bit confused here.

Oh wait, in the absence of specific information, perhaps the process is considered isentropic. Because that's a common assumption when dealing with nozzles unless stated otherwise. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So, I need to find h1 and h2, where h2 is determined at 40 Psia and the entropy s2 equals s1.

So first, I'll find the entropy s1 at the initial state, which is superheated steam at 80 Psia and 500°F. Looking up the steam tables for superheated steam.

Wait, I'm trying to remember the steam table data. At 80 Psia, 500°F... Let me think. So for water, superheated steam tables are organized by pressure. So at 80 Psia, I can find the temp and the properties.

Wait, I think at 80 Psia, the saturation temperature is lower than 500°F, so it's definitely superheated. So looking up, h1 would be the enthalpy at 80 Psia and 500°F. Similarly, s1 is the entropy there.

Once I have s1, I look for the state at 40 Psia where the entropy is equal to s1. That will give me h2.

Wait, but what if at 40 Psia, the entropy s1 is higher than the saturated vapor entropy? Then the state would be superheated. Or if it's between saturated liquid and vapor, it's a mixture. But I think in this case, since the initial state is superheated and the expansion is likely to continue being superheated, maybe the exit state is also superheated.

Alternatively, perhaps the exit is in the two-phase region. Hmm. I'll need to check the steam tables, but since I can't look them up now, I'll have to proceed with the data I remember.

Okay, so let's say I have to find h1 and h2.

I think at 80 Psia and 500°F, the enthalpy h1 is around 1268 Btu/lbm (I might be wrong, but I'll go with this number for now). The entropy s1 would be approximately 1.5454 Btu/lbm·R.

Now, at the exit, pressure is 40 Psia, and entropy s2 = s1 = 1.5454. I need to find the enthalpy h2 at 40 Psia and s=1.5454.

At 40 Psia, the saturation data: the saturated vapor entropy is around 1.6534, and saturated liquid is much lower. Wait, no, wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me think again. Let me recall that at 40 Psia, the saturation temperature is about 280.3°F. The entropy of saturated vapor (s_g) is approximately 1.6531, and the entropy of saturated liquid (s_f) is around 0.2346.

Wait, but our s2 is 1.5454, which is less than s_g. So that means the steam is still superheated at 40 Psia because s2 is less than s_g? Wait, no, wait. Wait, s_g is the entropy of saturated vapor. If the entropy at the exit is higher than s_g, it's superheated. If it's lower than s_g, that can't be. Because s_g is the maximum entropy at that pressure. So wait, maybe I'm confused.

Wait, no, the entropy of the saturated vapor is the highest possible at that pressure. So if the exit entropy is lower than that, that implies it's a saturated mixture. Wait, but wait, no, the entropy can't be lower, because entropy increases with energy. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, when steam expands, if it's an isentropic expansion, the entropy remains the same. So, at 80 Psia, 500°F, s1 is 1.5454. Now, at 40 Psia, if we have the same entropy, we need to find the state. Since at 40 Psia, the entropy of saturated vapor is higher than s1 (1.5454 < 1.6531), then the exit state is superheated steam at 40 Psia and entropy 1.5454.

Wait, no. If at 40 Psia, the entropy of the saturated vapor is 1.6531, which is higher than s1 of 1.5454, that suggests that the exit state is in the superheated region because the entropy is lower than the saturated vapor's entropy. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because at a given pressure, the entropy can't be lower than the saturated vapor's entropy if the steam is superheated. Wait, no, higher temperature leads to higher entropy. So, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think: for a given pressure, the entropy of saturated vapor is higher than that of superheated steam at the same pressure but lower temperature.

Wait no, that can't be. Because as temperature increases, entropy increases. Wait, no, in superheated steam, as temperature increases, entropy increases. So, at a given pressure, say 40 Psia, the saturated vapor has a certain entropy. If the steam is superheated beyond that, its entropy would be higher. So, if at 40 Psia, s2 is 1.5454, which is less than s_g (1.6531), that would mean the steam is not superheated. But wait, that would imply that it's a saturated mixture, but the entropy can't be lower than s_g for a saturated mixture. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Maybe the correct approach is that if the entropy at the exit pressure is greater than s_g, it's superheated. If it's less than s_g, it's a saturated mixture. But that doesn't make sense because s_g is the maximum entropy at that pressure. Wait, no, wait, the entropy of the saturated liquid is lower than that of saturated vapor. So, the entropy of superheated steam at a given pressure is higher than s_g, but that's not possible because s_g is the maximum. So I think I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify: At a given pressure, the entropy of the saturated vapor (s_g) is the maximum possible entropy at that pressure. So any state beyond that (superheated) would have higher entropy than s_g. Wait, but that can't be because s_g is the maximum. So, no, actually, I'm wrong. When steam is superheated beyond the saturation point, its entropy increases. So for a given pressure, as temperature increases beyond the saturation temperature, the entropy increases. So, the saturation vapor has entropy s_g, and superheated steam at higher temperatures would have higher s than s_g.

Wait, so if the exit entropy s2 is equal to s1 (1.5454), and at 40 Psia, s_g is 1.6531, then s2 < s_g. So this would imply that the steam cannot exist as superheated vapor at 40 Psia with s=1.5454 because that's less than s_g. So that would mean that the state is a mixture of liquid and vapor, right?

Wait, but that can't be possible because during the expansion of steam through a nozzle, it's unlikely to condense. Or is it possible? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the numbers. Let me try to recall:

At 80 Psia (which is about 5.5 bar), 500°F. The saturated temperature for 80 Psia is around 298°F (I think). So 500°F is superheated. So the entropy s1 is higher than the entropy of saturated vapor at 80 Psia.

Wait, let me think: at 80 Psia, the saturated vapor entropy s_g is around 1.5263, and the superheated steam at 500°F would have a higher entropy, say around 1.585 or something. Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it this way: if I can't find the exact values, perhaps I can proceed with approximate calculations.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the process is isentropic, so s2 = s1.

So, s1 is the entropy at 80 Psia, 500°F. Let's say that's approximately 1.585 Btu/lbm·R.

Then, at the exit, pressure is 40 Psia, and s2 = 1.585.

Now, checking steam tables for 40 Psia: the saturated vapor entropy s_g is around 1.653. Hmm, so s2 = 1.585 is less than s_g. So does that mean the steam is in a two-phase state?

Wait, but wait, that can't be. Because if s2 is less than s_g, that would imply that at 40 Psia, the steam is a mixture because the entropy is between s_f and s_g.

Wait, but let's think: the entropy of the saturated liquid, s_f, at 40 Psia is around 0.312, and s_g is around 1.653. So if s2 is 1.585, that's between s_f and s_g. So the quality would be (s2 - s_f)/(s_g - s_f) = (1.585 - 0.312)/(1.653 - 0.312) = (1.273)/(1.341) ≈ 0.95, or 95% quality.

Wait, but that would mean that at 40 Psia, the steam is a wet mixture, 95% vapor. But in a nozzle, which is a converging-diverging or converging nozzle, if the steam is expanding and the pressure drops, but if it's a wet mixture, that would imply that condensation has occurred, which is possible, but perhaps in this problem, they're assuming superheated throughout.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assumption. Maybe the process isn't isentropic. Wait, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's just a steady flow process, and I can't assume entropy is constant. Hmm, that complicates things, because without knowing more, I can't find h2.

Wait, but the question is about using steam tables, so maybe I should proceed under the assumption that it's isentropic. Otherwise, I can't solve it without more data.

So, proceeding under that assumption, even if the exit state is a two-phase mixture.

So, at 40 Psia, s2 = s1 = 1.585 (I'll go with that number for now).

Then, the enthalpy h2 would be the enthalpy of the mixture: h_f + x*h_fg.

Where x is the quality, which we calculated as ~0.95.

So, h_f at 40 Psia is around 438.8 Btu/lbm, and h_fg is 889.2 Btu/lbm. So h2 = 438.8 + 0.95*889.2 ≈ 438.8 + 844.3 ≈ 1283.1 Btu/lbm.

Wait, but wait, that can't be. Because if the initial h1 is 1268, and h2 is 1283, that would mean that the enthalpy increased, which would lead to a negative velocity, which doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I got the s1 wrong. Let me recount:

At 80 Psia, 500°F, superheated steam.

Looking up steam tables (from memory):

At 80 Psia, the saturation temperature is about 297.7°F. So above that, it's superheated. So, looking up superheated table at 80 Psia.

I think at 80 Psia, 500°F:

h ≈ 1268.4 Btu/lbm

s ≈ 1.5454 Btu/lbm·R

So s1 = 1.5454.

At 40 Psia, s2 = 1.5454.

Now, at 40 Psia, the saturated vapor entropy s_g is about 1.6531, which is higher than s2. Wait, no, 1.5454 is less than 1.6531. So s2 < s_g, which suggests that at 40 Psia, the steam is a mixture, because the entropy is between s_f and s_g.

So, s_f at 40 Psia is about 0.2346, s_g is 1.6531.

So x = (s2 - s_f)/(s_g - s_f) = (1.5454 - 0.2346)/(1.6531 - 0.2346) = (1.3108)/(1.4185) ≈ 0.924, so 92.4% quality.

Then, h2 = h_f + x*h_fg.

h_f at 40 Psia is about 438.8 Btu/lbm.

h_fg is about 889.2 Btu/lbm.

So h2 = 438.8 + 0.924 * 889.2 ≈ 438.8 + 823.0 ≈ 1261.8 Btu/lbm.

Now, back to the energy equation: h1 = h2 + (V2²)/2

So, 1268.4 = 1261.8 + (V2²)/2

Subtract 1261.8: 6.6 = V2² / 2

Multiply both sides by 2: 13.2 = V2²

So V2 = sqrt(13.2) ≈ 3.635 ft/s ?

Wait, that can't be right. The options are in thousands of ft/s. So something's wrong here.

Wait, no, wait. I think I made a mistake in the units. Steam tables are usually in Btu/lbm, but when using the energy equation, the units need to be consistent.

Wait, the steady flow equation is: h1 + (V1^2)/2 = h2 + (V2^2)/2

But the units for h are in Btu/lbm, and velocity is in ft/s. So to make the units consistent, I need to convert Btu to ft·lbf or something.

Wait, I remember that 1 Btu = 778.169 ft·lbf.

So, the equation becomes:

h1 (Btu/lbm) * 778.169 + (V1^2)/2 = h2 (Btu/lbm) * 778.169 + (V2^2)/2

Since V1 is zero, it's:

h1 * 778.169 = h2 * 778.169 + (V2^2)/2

So, rearranging:

V2^2 = 2 * 778.169 * (h1 - h2)

So plugging in the numbers:

h1 = 1268.4 Btu/lbm

h2 = 1261.8 Btu/lbm

h1 - h2 = 6.6 Btu/lbm

So V2^2 = 2 * 778.169 * 6.6

Calculate that:

2 * 778.169 ≈ 1556.338

1556.338 * 6.6 ≈ 10,270.3

So V2^2 ≈ 10,270.3

Therefore, V2 ≈ sqrt(10,270.3) ≈ 101.34 ft/s

Wait, that's way too low. But the options are all in thousands. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial assumption about the process. Maybe it's not isentropic. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the h2 calculation.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the exit state is superheated, not a mixture. Let me try that approach.

If at 40 Psia, the entropy s2 = 1.5454 is higher than s_g, then it's superheated. But wait, earlier I thought s_g at 40 Psia is 1.6531, which is higher than 1.5454. So that would mean that s2 is less than s_g, which would imply a mixture, not superheated.

Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I have the s_g value incorrect. Let me try to recall again. At 40 Psia, the saturation temperature is about 280°F. The entropy of saturated vapor (s_g) is approximately 1.6531 Btu/lbm·R, and saturated liquid (s_f) is around 0.2346.

So if s2 is 1.5454, which is between s_f and s_g, it's a mixture. So the earlier calculation holds.

But then the velocity is about 100 ft/s, which doesn't match any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe the process isn't isentropic. If that's the case, then I can't assume s2 = s1. But without
