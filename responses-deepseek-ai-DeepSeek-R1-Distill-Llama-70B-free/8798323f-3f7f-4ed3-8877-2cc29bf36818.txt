Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about barometers. The question is asking whether a barometer that uses water instead of mercury will be... and there are several options. I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but I'll try to work through this.

First, I remember that a barometer measures atmospheric pressure. The most common type is the mercury barometer, which Torricelli invented. In that, mercury is used because it's a good choice for several reasons. But what about using water instead?

So, I think the key here is the density of the liquids. Mercury is a dense metal, so it's heavy. Water is much less dense. I recall that in a mercury barometer, the mercury column is about 76 cm high when the atmospheric pressure is standard (which is why it's called a 76 cm Hg pressure).

Density (ρ) relates to pressure and height. The formula I think is P = ρgh, where P is pressure, ρ is density, g is gravity, and h is height. So if the pressure is the same, but the density changes, the height must adjust accordingly.

Mercury has a density of about 13.6 g/cm³, while water is around 1 g/cm³. So mercury is roughly 13.6 times denser than water. If I rearrange the formula to solve for h, I get h = P/(ρg). So if the density decreases, the height should increase proportionally.

Let's plug the numbers. Mercury's height is 76 cm. If water is 1/13.6th the density, then the height would be 76 cm * 13.6. Let me calculate that. 76 * 13.6. Hmm, 70 *13.6 is 952, and 6*13.6 is 81.6, so total is 1033.6 cm. That's like over 10 meters! So a water barometer would be way taller than a mercury one.

Now, looking back at the options: the question is about which characteristic applies. The options are A to J.

Option E is "taller". That makes sense because the height increases when using a less dense fluid. So a water barometer would need to be much taller than a mercury one to reach the same pressure measurement.

Other options: shorter would be the opposite, so B is wrong. More fragile? Mercury is a liquid but water is also, so maybe not. Heavier? Mercury is denser, so a mercury barometer would actually be heavier, but the question is about the water one. So option C says heavier, but perhaps because water is less dense, the barometer's tube needs to be longer, but the total mass might depend on the volume. I'm not sure about that. But the primary issue here is the height.

Another thought: since water is less dense, the column needed is taller, so the barometer would be taller. So the correct answer should be E: taller.

A barometer using water instead of mercury would require a taller column due to water's lower density compared to mercury. Since the height of the fluid column is inversely proportional to the density of the fluid, water, being approximately 1/13.6th the density of mercury, would result in a column about 13.6 times taller than the mercury barometer's 76 cm. This makes the water barometer significantly taller.

E: taller

Answer: E
