Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about pigeons and their coat patterns and colors. I'm a bit rusty on my Punnett squares, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain by recessive c. Red is dominant B, and brown is recessive b. So, we're looking at two traits here: pattern (checkered vs plain) and color (red vs brown). Both are controlled by two separate genes, so I think this is a dihybrid cross problem.

The parents are a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Let's break that down. Homozygous checkered red would mean that for both genes, the bird has two dominant alleles. So the genotype should be CC for checkered (since it's homozygous dominant) and BB for red (also homozygous dominant). Wait, no, wait. Wait, red is dominant, so the genotype would be BB. But wait, the other parent is plain brown. Plain is recessive, so cc, and brown is recessive, so bb. So the parents are CCBB (homozygous dominant for both traits) and ccbb (homozygous recessive for both). 

Wait, the question says it's a dihybrid cross involving these two parents. So the cross is P: CCBB × ccbb. But wait, dihybrid cross usually refers to a cross between two F1 hybrids, but the P here is the parent generation. Oh wait, no, dihybrid cross can refer to any cross involving two traits. So the initial cross here would produce F1 offspring.

Wait, but the question says to make a Punnett square for a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So I think the cross is CCBB (P) × ccbb (P). Wait, but that's not a dihybrid cross. Because dihybrid cross implies that both parents are hybrid for both traits, right? Wait, no. Oh wait, no, in a dihybrid cross, each parent contributes different alleles for two traits. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the terminology. 

No, wait, dihybrid refers to two traits. So the parents could be pure for each of the two traits but different from each other. So CCBB and ccbb are the parents, each homozygous for their respective alleles. So their F1 would all be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. 

Wait, but the question is about the F2 generation. Oh, because it says for the F2 generation. So the setup is that the F1 is CcBb, and when they self or cross with each other, the F2 results from that.

So the Punnett square for F1 × F1 would give us the F2 generation. So the parents for the Punnett square are both CcBb.

Wait, looking back at the question, the setup is that the F1 is CcBb. So the cross is F1 × F1, which is CcBb × CcBb.

I think the question provided some gametes and a partial Punnett square. Let me look. It says Gametes: (CB) (cb), then F1 × F1: CcBb × CcBb. Gametes: (CB) (Cb) (cB) (cb). So each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, Cb, cB, cb.

The Punnett square is started, but I don't think I need to redo it; I just need to figure out the phenotypic ratios.

But wait, the question is about the F2 generation. So the F2 comes from selfing F1 or from F1 × F1. Since each F1 is CcBb, when they mate, each can produce four gametes. So the Punnett square would be 4x4 = 16 boxes.

Wait, the Punnett square provided in the question seems incomplete. Let me read it again. It lists the gametes as (CB), (Cb), (cB), (cb). So for each F1 parent, four gametes.

Then, the Punnett square is partially filled. The rows are the gametes from one parent, and the columns from the other. Each cell combines the two gametes. Let's see:

The first row starts with (CB) and then each column adds another gamete. So (CB) + (CB) would be CCBB, (CB) + (Cb) would be CCBb, (CB) + (cB) would be CcBB, and (CB) + (cb) would be CcBb.

Similarly, the second row starts with (Cb): (Cb)+(CB)= CCBb, (Cb)+(Cb)= CCbb, (Cb)+(cB)= CcBb, (Cb)+(cb)= Ccbb.

Third row starts with (cB): (cB)+(CB)= CcBB, (cB)+(Cb)= CcBb, (cB)+(cB)= ccBB, (cB)+(cb)= ccBb.

Fourth row starts with (cb): (cb)+(CB)= CcBb, (cb)+(Cb)= Ccbb, (cb)+(cB)= ccBb, (cb)+(cb)= c c b b.

Wait, but looking at the provided Punnett square, it's only filled in for the first few cells, but perhaps I can proceed without it.

Each of the 16 squares corresponds to a genotype. But maybe I don't need to list all of them. Instead, I can think about the phenotypic ratios.

Wait, let's think about each trait separately. Since the two genes are independent (assuming they assort independently), the phenotypic ratios can be found by considering each gene's segregation.

For the checkered/plain trait (C/c), the F1 is Cc. So when Cc × Cc occurs, the genotypic ratio is CC : 2 Cc : cc, which is 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. Since C is dominant, the phenotype for checkered is CC and Cc, so 3/4 checkered and 1/4 plain.

Similarly for the color, B/b: F1 is Bb. So Bb × Bb gives genotypic ratio 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Phenotype: 3/4 red (dominant) and 1/4 brown.

Since the two traits are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios.

So for checkered (3/4) and red (3/4), the combined would be 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 checkered red.

Checkered and brown: 3/4 checkered * 1/4 brown = 3/16.

Plain and red: 1/4 plain * 3/4 red = 3/16.

Plain and brown: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16.

So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.

So total of 16 parts: 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see which one matches this.

Option C says: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. So that would be the 9:3:3:1 ratio.

Let me double-check the options:

Option C: 9,3,3,1. So that's correct.

Wait, but the options are given as:

Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

Yes. So the correct answer should be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, let me think again. When you have two dominant traits, the 9:3:3:1 is for when both parents are heterozygous. Wait, no, in a dihybrid cross of two heterozygotes, yes, that's correct.

Yes, so the F2 generation from F1 (CcBb) × F1 (CcBb) would give a 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the correct option is C.

The problem involves a dihybrid cross in pigeons, where the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene \( C \) and plain color by the recessive allele \( c \). Red color is controlled by a dominant gene \( B \), and brown color by the recessive allele \( b \). The cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (\( CCBB \)) and a plain brown bird (\( ccbb \)), producing \( F_1 \) offspring that are all \( CcBb \). The question asks for the phenotypic ratios in the \( F_2 \) generation, which results from crossing the \( F_1 \) individuals (\( CcBb \times CcBb \)).

To determine the phenotypic ratios, we analyze the segregation of the two traits independently:

1. **Checkered/Plain Trait (\( C/c \)):**
   - The genotypic ratio from \( Cc \times Cc \) is \( 1:2:1 \) (\( CC:2Cc:cc \)).
   - Since \( C \) is dominant, the phenotypic ratio is \( 3:1 \) (checkered:plain).

2. **Red/Brown Trait (\( B/b \)):**
   - The genotypic ratio from \( Bb \times Bb \) is \( 1:2:1 \) (\( BB:2Bb:bb \)).
   - Since \( B \) is dominant, the phenotypic ratio is \( 3:1 \) (red:brown).

Since the two traits assort independently, the combined phenotypic ratio is the product of the individual ratios:
\[
(3:1) \times (3:1) = 9:3:3:1
\]
This corresponds to:
- 9 parts checkered red,
- 3 parts checkered brown,
- 3 parts plain red,
- 1 part plain brown.

Among the given options, **Option C** matches this phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

**Answer: C**
