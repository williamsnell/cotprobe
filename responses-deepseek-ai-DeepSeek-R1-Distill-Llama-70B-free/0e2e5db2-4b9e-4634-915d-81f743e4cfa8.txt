Okay, so I've got this optics problem here about a thin lens changing its focal length when immersed in water. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

Alright, the problem states that the lens has a focal length of 10 inches in air, and its refractive index is 1.53. Then it's immersed in water, which has a refractive index of 1.33. I need to find the new focal length.

Wait, I remember something about the lens maker's formula. Oh right, the formula is 1/f = (n_rel - 1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), where n_rel is the relative refractive index of the lens material compared to the surrounding medium. 

So when the lens is in air, the relative refractive index is n_lens / n_medium. Since air has n=1, it's just 1.53. But when it's in water, the surrounding medium is water with n=1.33. So the relative index becomes 1.53 / 1.33. 

Wait, wait, actually I think the formula uses (n_lens - n_medium)/(n_lens + n_medium), no, wait no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Oh no, the lens maker's formula is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), where n is the refractive index of the lens relative to the surrounding medium. So when in air, n is 1.53, but when in water, it's (n_lens - n_water)/(1) over (n_lens + n_water)? No, wait, no. No, wait, the formula is 1/f = (n_lens/n_medium - 1) * (something). Or maybe it's (n2/n1 -1) something? 

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The lens maker's formula in a medium is 1/f = (n_lens/n_medium - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2), right? Because when the lens is in a medium, the relative refractive index is n_lens divided by the medium's n. So when in air, n_medium is 1, so it's (1.53/1 -1) = 0.53. 

So in air, 1/f_air = 0.53 * (1/R1 -1/R2). And in water, the same lens would have 1/f_water = (1.53/1.33 -1) * (1/R1 -1/R2). 

Oh, so the (1/R1 -1/R2) term is the same in both cases because it's the same lens, same curvatures. So the ratio of the focal lengths would be the inverse of the ratio of the (n-1) terms. 

Let me compute that. In air, (n_air) = 1.53/1 = 1.53. So (n_air -1) is 0.53. In water, (n_water) = 1.53/1.33 ≈ 1.15. So (n_water -1) is 0.15. 

So the focal length in water f_water is (0.53 / 0.15) times f_air. Because since 1/f is proportional to (n-1), f is proportional to 1/(n-1). So f_water = f_air * (0.53 / 0.15).

Wait, wait, let me think again. If 1/f = k * (n-1), then f = 1/(k*(n-1)). So the ratio f_water/f_air would be ( (n_air -1) ) / (n_water -1) ). Because f_air = 1/(k*(n_air-1)), f_water = 1/(k*(n_water-1)). So f_water/f_air = (n_air -1)/(n_water -1). 

Ah, that's right. Because if (n_air-1) is 0.53 and (n_water-1) is 0.15, then f_water = f_air * (0.53 / 0.15). 

Let me compute that. 0.53 divided by 0.15 is approximately 3.533... So 10 inches times 3.533 is about 35.33 inches. Hmm, looking at the options, option H is 35.2 inches. That's pretty close. 

Wait, but let me calculate more accurately. 0.53 / 0.15 equals exactly 3.533333... So 10 * 3.533333 is 35.3333... So 35.333 inches. The closest option given is H, 35.2 inches. Or wait, maybe I should compute 1.53/1.33 more accurately. Let's do that. 

1.53 divided by 1.33: 1.33 times 1.15 is 1.5295, which is very close to 1.53. So 1.53/1.33 is approximately 1.15. Then, 1.15 minus 1 is 0.15. So the previous calculation holds.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact (1.53/1.33 - 1) and (1.53 -1) to get more precise numbers. 

Let me compute (1.53 / 1.33) exactly. Let's see, 1.53 ÷ 1.33. 1.33 times 1 is 1.33. Subtract that from 1.53, we have 0.20 left. Bring down a zero: 2.00. 1.33 goes into 2.00 once (1.33), remainder 0.67. Bring down a zero: 6.70. 1.33 ×5 is 6.65, so 5 times, 0.05 remaining. Bring down a zero: 0.50. 1.33 ×0.3 is 0.399. So approximately 1.15 (as 1.15 is 1 + 0.15). So 1.53/1.33 ≈ 1.15. So (n_rel in water -1) is 0.15.

So the ratio is 0.53 / 0.15 = 3.5333. So 10 * 3.5333 is 35.3333 inches. The options don't have 35.333, but option H is 35.2, which is close. Maybe due to rounding somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.53 divided by 1.33 more accurately. Let me compute that: 1.53 ÷ 1.33.

1.33 × 1.147... Let me compute 1.33 × 1.15: 1.33 ×1 = 1.33; 1.33 ×0.15=0.1995. So 1.33 ×1.15 = 1.5295. So 1.53 is 1.53, which is 0.0005 more than 1.5295. So 1.53/1.33 = 1.15 + (0.0005)/(1.33) ≈ 1.15 + 0.000376 = approximately 1.150376. So (n_water-1) is 0.150376.

So (n_air -1) is 0.53. So 0.53 / 0.150376 = let's compute that.

0.53 ÷ 0.150376. Let me compute 0.53 / 0.15 = 3.5333. But 0.150376 is a little larger than 0.15, so the result would be a bit less than 3.5333. Let's calculate it:

0.53 / 0.150376 ≈ 3.526. So 10 inches × 3.526 ≈ 35.26 inches. So approximately 35.26 inches. Looking at the options, H is 35.2 inches, which is very close. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again: why is the focal length increasing? Because when the lens is in a medium with higher refractive index than air, the lens's power decreases. Because (n-1) is smaller, so 1/f is smaller, so f is larger. So a converging lens (assuming it's converging in air) would have a longer focal length in water. So the focal length should be longer than 10 inches. So 35.2 inches makes sense.

So the correct answer should be option H: 35.2 inches.

To determine the focal length of the lens when immersed in water, we use the lens maker's formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = (n_{\text{rel}} - 1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right),
\]

where \( n_{\text{rel}} = \frac{n_{\text{lens}}}{n_{\text{medium}}} \). The term \( \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right) \) remains constant for the same lens, so the focal length is inversely proportional to \( (n_{\text{rel}} - 1) \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( n_{\text{rel}} - 1 \) in air and water
- In air (\( n_{\text{medium}} = 1 \)):
  \[
  n_{\text{rel, air}} = \frac{n_{\text{lens}}}{n_{\text{air}}} = 1.53, \quad n_{\text{rel, air}} - 1 = 1.53 - 1 = 0.53.
  \]

- In water (\( n_{\text{medium}} = 1.33 \)):
  \[
  n_{\text{rel, water}} = \frac{n_{\text{lens}}}{n_{\text{water}}} = \frac{1.53}{1.33} \approx 1.15, \quad n_{\text{rel, water}} - 1 = 1.15 - 1 = 0.15.
  \]

### Step 2: Relate the focal lengths in air and water
Since \( f \propto \frac{1}{n_{\text{rel}} - 1} \), the ratio of the focal lengths is:

\[
\frac{f_{\text{water}}}{f_{\text{air}}} = \frac{n_{\text{rel, air}} - 1}{n_{\text{rel, water}} - 1}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{f_{\text{water}}}{f_{\text{air}}} = \frac{0.53}{0.15} \approx 3.533.
\]

Thus:

\[
f_{\text{water}} = f_{\text{air}} \times 3.533 = 10 \times 3.533 \approx 35.33 \, \text{inches}.
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated focal length in water is approximately \( 35.33 \, \text{inches} \). The closest option provided is **35.2 inches**.

### Final Answer:
H: 35.2 inches.
