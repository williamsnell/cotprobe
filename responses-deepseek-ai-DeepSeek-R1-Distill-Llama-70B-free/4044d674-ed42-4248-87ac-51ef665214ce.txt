Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the World Health Organization's recommendation on free sugar intake. Hmm, I remember that the WHO has guidelines on sugar consumption, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers.

Wait, I think they've suggested that people should limit their intake of free sugars. Free sugars are those added to foods, not the natural sugars found in fruits and milk, right? So the question is about the maximum intake they recommend.

I recall that the general guideline is that adults and children should keep their intake of free sugars below a certain percentage of their total daily energy intake. I think the primary recommendation is less than 10%, but there's something about reducing it even further to below 5% for additional health benefits.

So the question asks for the maximum intake the WHO strongly recommends. I think the strong recommendation is the <10% because that's the main target, and the <5% is more like a suggestion for extra benefits. But wait, was the strong recommendation specifically for below 10% or was it 5%?

I remember reading that the WHO's strong recommendation is to limit to less than 10% of total energy intake. They also say that reducing to below 5% can provide additional health benefits, but that's a conditional recommendation because the evidence is less consistent or the benefits might be smaller.

Looking at the options, option C is <10%. Option E is <5%. So the strong recommendation is C, and E is more like a suggestion. So the correct answer should be C.

But wait, I should double-check. Let me think again. The WHO's 2015 guidelines said that adults and children should reduce their daily intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake. They also suggested that reducing to below 5% would be better. So the strong recommendation is for less than 10%, making option C the correct answer.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that adults and children limit their intake of free sugars to less than 10% of their total daily energy intake. This is a strong recommendation based on robust evidence. While reducing intake to below 5% is suggested for additional health benefits, it is not the primary strong recommendation. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: <10%

Answer: C
