Okay, I'm trying to answer this question about Peter Singer's views on genetic supermarkets and the social problems they might cause. The question asks which problem Singer thinks is the least serious among the options given. 

First, I need to remember what Singer's arguments are regarding genetic engineering and its societal impacts. From what I recall, Singer discusses various ethical issues in his work, including concerns about equality and human diversity.

The options given are A through D. Let's break them down one by one.

Option A: Loss of human diversity. I think Singer might be concerned about this because if people start engineering their children to have certain traits, there might be a trend towards uniformity. But would he consider this the least serious issue? Maybe not, since diversity is important for adaptation and societal health.

Option B: The effects of engineering children to have positional goods. Positional goods are things that are valuable because not everyone can have them, like luxury cars or elite education. If parents engineer their kids to have traits that give them an edge, it could create a society where only the wealthy have access, which might lead to a loss of social mobility. I'm not sure how Singer ranks this compared to other issues.

Option C: Loss of equality of opportunity. This sounds similar to increased disparity between rich and poor. If genetic enhancements are expensive, only the rich can afford them, so the poor can't compete as equally in opportunities like education or jobs. Singer probably sees this as a significant issue because it undermines fairness.

Option D: Increased disparity between the rich and the poor. This ties directly into economic inequality. If the rich can afford genetic enhancements, the gap between them and the poor widens. Singer often discusses issues of fairness and justice, so I think he takes this very seriously.

The question is which is the least serious in Singer's view. I'm trying to remember if he downplays any of these. I think he's more concerned with issues that directly cause suffering or violate moral principles. Loss of diversity (A) is bad, but maybe he thinks it's a secondary issue compared to the direct inequalities caused by options C and D. Alternatively, maybe engineering for positional goods (B) is seen as less problematic than the structural inequalities of C and D.

Wait, another angle: Positional goods are relative. If everyone has the same enhancements, they don't provide an advantage anymore. But if only some have them, it creates inequality. So Singer might think that engineering for positional goods actually leads to more serious problems like increased disparity (D) and loss of equality of opportunity (C). So perhaps option B is more about the mechanism that leads to the problems in C and D, which are worse outcomes.

Alternatively, maybe Singer considers the loss of diversity (A) as a significant issue because it affects the gene pool's adaptability and could have long-term consequences for humanity. But I'm not certain.

I'm trying to remember if Singer has written about this. I think in his discussions on genetic engineering, he's more concerned with the exacerbation of social inequalities. So issues like increased disparity (D) and loss of equality of opportunity (C) are more pressing for him. 

Between the options, then, which is the least serious? If A is loss of diversity, perhaps he views this as less immediately problematic compared to the direct social inequalities. Or maybe B, the effects of positional goods, because they might be a subset of the broader inequality issues.

Wait, the question is about the least serious. So which of these does he think is not as bad as the others. I'm thinking that perhaps the loss of diversity (A) is a concern, but maybe Singer doesn't see it as the most pressing compared to the economic disparities. Or maybe he thinks that some diversity might still be maintained, making A less of a problem than the others.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to Singer's view that the problem of positional goods isn't as severe as the others. But I'm not sure about that.

Another approach: looking for the answer from what I've read. I think Singer argues that the main issues are increased inequality (D) and loss of equality of opportunity (C). So the least serious would be either A or B. Between those, perhaps he thinks loss of diversity is less of a problem because genetic diversity could still exist in other traits. Or maybe engineering for positional goods is more about individual choices and less about systemic issues.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think differently. The question is about the least serious problem according to Singer. If he's more concerned with economic disparities, then the least would be loss of diversity or positional goods.

I think I've read that Singer is particularly worried about the exacerbation of inequality and the undermining of the lottery of life, which equality of opportunity depends on. So perhaps the least serious would be the loss of human diversity, as the other problems are more directly harmful to individuals and society.

Alternatively, maybe the effects of engineering for positional goods is the least serious because it's more about individual choice and market dynamics, which might be manageable through regulation, whereas the other issues are more deeply structural.

Hmm. I'm not entirely certain, but based on what I know, I think the answer is A: loss of human diversity. Or maybe B.

Wait, I think Singer might consider the loss of equality of opportunity (C) and increased disparity (D) as the most serious. Between A and B, I'm trying to recall. I think he discusses that allowing genetic enhancements could lead to a society where people are engineered to have traits that only benefit them in a competitive society, which ties into positional goods. So B could be a problem, but maybe he thinks it's less serious than the others.

Alternatively, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should make an educated guess. If the options are A, B, C, D, and the least serious is either A or B, I'll have to pick based on what I think Singer emphasizes more.

I think Singer would be more concerned with issues that create direct inequality and unfairness. So loss of diversity is a problem, but perhaps not as immediately harmful as the economic and opportunity disparities. Therefore, the least serious problem would be A: loss of human diversity.

To determine which social problem Peter Singer thinks is the least serious among the options provided, it's important to analyze his views on genetic engineering and its societal impacts. Singer is known for emphasizing ethical concerns, particularly those related to equality and fairness. 

- **Option A: Loss of human diversity**. While Singer might acknowledge this as a concern, he may view it as less immediately harmful compared to issues that directly exacerbate inequality. Genetic diversity's importance for adaptability could mean it is still maintained in other traits, making this problem secondary to others.

- **Option B: The effects of engineering children to have positional goods**. Positional goods, which derive value from their exclusivity, could lead to a competitive society where only the wealthy benefit. However, this issue might be seen as a subset of broader inequality problems, potentially making it less serious in Singer's view compared to direct disparities.

- **Option C: Loss of equality of opportunity**. Singer is deeply concerned about fairness and justice. Genetic enhancements could undermine equality of opportunity, making this a significant issue for him.

- **Option D: Increased disparity between the rich and the poor**. This is a direct consequence of economic inequality, which Singer likely views as a pressing concern. If genetic enhancements are accessible only to the wealthy, the gap between the rich and poor widens, exacerbating societal inequities.

Given Singer's emphasis on fairness and equality, the least serious problem in his view is likely **A: loss of human diversity**, as it may be seen as a secondary issue compared to the direct and harmful effects of inequality and disparity.
