Okay, so I have this problem here about a water tank and filling it up. Let me read it again. The tank holds 50 gallons, and I need to find the flow rate in gallons per second to fill it in 20 seconds. Hmm, okay, flow rate is like how much water flows per unit time, right?

So, the formula I remember is flow rate equals volume divided by time. That makes sense because if you have a certain volume and you want to know how fast it's filling, you divide by the time it takes. So here, the volume is 50 gallons, and the time is 20 seconds.

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. Flow rate (Q) is volume (V) over time (t). So Q = V / t. So plugging in the numbers, that would be 50 gallons divided by 20 seconds. Let me calculate that. 50 divided by 20 is 2.5. Oh wait, 50/20 is 2.5. So that would be 2.5 gallons per second.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are A through J. Option J is 2.5. So the answer must be J.

But wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. If the tank is 50 gallons and I fill it in 20 seconds, then each second, 2.5 gallons are added. That sounds correct. Because 2.5 times 20 is 50. Yep, that makes sense. So I think J is the right choice.

The flow rate required to fill a 50-gallon tank in 20 seconds is calculated using the formula \( Q = \frac{V}{t} \), where \( V = 50 \) gallons and \( t = 20 \) seconds. Substituting the values gives \( Q = \frac{50}{20} = 2.5 \) gallons per second. Among the provided options, the correct answer is J.

Answer: J
