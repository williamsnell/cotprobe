Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, let me read the question again.

The problem says that a proton has a speed of 6.1e6 m/s, and we need to find the uncertainty in its location if the uncertainty in its momentum is reduced to 0.0100 percent. The options are given in picometers, which is 1e-12 meters.

I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainties in momentum and position. The formula is something like Δx * Δp >= h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. Oh wait, right, h bar (ħ) is h divided by 2π, so sometimes the formula is written as Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2.

Wait, but the exact form might be important here. Let me think. The Heisenberg principle is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. So, to get the minimum uncertainty, I can use Δx = ħ/(2 Δp).

But wait, the problem gives the uncertainty in momentum as a percentage. Oh, right, 0.01% of the momentum. So first I need to calculate the momentum p, then find 0.01% of that as Δp.

Calculating the momentum p: p = m*v. The mass of a proton is approximately 1.67e-27 kg. Given v is 6.1e6 m/s.

So p = 1.67e-27 kg * 6.1e6 m/s. Let me compute that. Multiply 1.67 by 6.1 first. 1.67 * 6 is about 10.02, and 1.67 * 0.1 is 0.167, so total is approximately 10.187. Then multiply by 1e-27 * 1e6 = 1e-21. So p ≈ 1.0187e-20 kg·m/s.

Wait, let me double-check that math. 1.67e-27 *6.1e6 = (1.67 *6.1) * 1e-27+6 = let's compute 1.67*6.1. 1.6*6=9.6, 1.6*0.1=0.16, 0.07*6=0.42, 0.07*0.1=0.007. So 9.6 +0.16=9.76, 0.42+0.007=0.427. Total 9.76+0.427=10.187. So yeah, p≈10.187e-21 kg·m/s.

Then, the uncertainty in momentum, Δp, is 0.0100% of p. So Δp = 0.0001 * p. So 0.0001 * 10.187e-21 = 1.0187e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, plug this into the uncertainty principle formula. Δx = ħ/(2Δp). Wait, no, the formula is Δx >= ħ/(2 Δp), assuming the minimum uncertainty.

Wait, actually, the Heisenberg principle is often approximated as Δx Δp ≈ ħ. Some sources use 4π, others use 2. Let me confirm the exact expression. Oh right, the exact inequality is Δx Δp ≥ h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. So if I solve for Δx, it would be Δx ≥ h/(4π Δp).

But wait, sometimes the formula is written using ħ, which is h/(2π). So substituting, h = 2π ħ. So substituting in, Δx ≥ (2π ħ) / (4π Δp) )= ħ/(2 Δp). So yes, that's correct.

So now, I need the value of ħ. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 6.626e-34 /6.283 ≈ approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So plugging in the numbers: Δx = 1.0545718e-34 / (2 * 1.0187e-25 )

Calculate the denominator first: 2 * 1.0187e-25 = 2.0374e-25.

So Δx = 1.0545718e-34 / 2.0374e-25 ≈ Let me compute that.

Divide 1.0545718e-34 by 2.0374e-25. The exponents: 1e-34 / 1e-25 = 1e-9. So 1.05457 / 2.0374 is approximately 0.5176. So 0.5176e-9 meters is 5.176e-10 meters. Wait, but wait, 1e-9 is a nanometer, so 0.5176e-9 is 5.176e-10 m, which is 0.5176 nanometers. But wait, wait, 1e-12 meters is a picometer. So 5.176e-10 m is 517.6 picometers? Wait, no, wait, 1e-9 is a nanometer, and 1e-12 is a picometer. So 5.176e-10 m is 5.176e-10 m = 516.76 pm.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the math.

1.0545718e-34 divided by 2.0374e-25.

1.0545718 / 2.0374 = approx let's compute. 2.0374 is about 2.037. 2.037 * 0.5 is 1.0185. Hmm, 1.054 is a bit more than 0.5 times 2.037. So 0.5 * 2.037 = 1.0185. 1.0546-1.0185=0.0361. So 0.5 + 0.0361/2.0374.

Wait, 0.0361 / 2.0374 ≈ 0.0177. So total is approx 0.5177. So yes, 0.5177. Then multiply by 1e-9 (since 1e-34 / 1e-25 = 1e-9). So 0.5177e-9 m is 5.177e-10 m, which is 517.7 pm.

But looking at the options, the choices are A:42, B:33, C:52, D:85, E:38, F:47, G:75, H:58, I:65, J:29. Wait, none of the options are around 517 pm. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, wait, wait. Oh! Wait, the uncertainty is 0.0100 percent of the momentum. So in my calculation, I took 0.0001 times p. Let me double-check that. 0.01% is 0.0001, correct. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I made an error in calculating p. Let me recalculate p. p = m*v. m is 1.67e-27 kg, v is 6.1e6 m/s.

So 1.67e-27 *6.1e6 = (1.67 *6.1) * 1e-27+6 → 1e-21. 1.67 *6 = 10.02, 1.67 *0.1=0.167, so 10.02 +0.167 =10.187. So p=10.187e-21 kg·m/s. That seems correct.

Then Δp is 0.0001 *10.187e-21 = 1.0187e-25 kg·m/s.

So now, Δx = ħ/(2 Δp) → 1.0545718e-34 / (2 *1.0187e-25) → denominator is 2.0374e-25. So 1.0545718e-34 / 2.0374e-25 → 1.0545718 / 2.0374 = approx 0.5176, and 1e-34 /1e-25 = 1e-9. So 0.5176e-9 m = 5.176e-10 m = 517.6 pm. Hmm, but the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Let me think again. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/(2). So if Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, then Δx is at least ħ/(2 Δp). So I think I did that correctly.

Wait, maybe I need to express the uncertainty in terms of momentum as a percentage, but wait, I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps the question meant relative uncertainty, but in terms of absolute uncertainty, I think I handled it correctly.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let's compute 1.0545718e-34 divided by 2.0374e-25.

1.0545718e-34 / 2.0374e-25 = (1.0545718 / 2.0374) * 1e-9.

Let me compute 1.0545718 / 2.0374 more accurately.

2.0374 * 0.5 = 1.0187.

1.0545718 - 1.0187 = 0.0358718. So 0.5 + (0.0358718 / 2.0374) → 0.0358718 / 2.0374 ≈ 0.0176.

So 0.5 + 0.0176 = 0.5176, so 0.5176 * 1e-9 m = 5.176e-10 m = 517.6 pm.

Wait, but the options are all way smaller than that. Did I make a mistake in units? Wait, 1e-10 m is an angstrom, 1e-12 is picometer. So 5.176e-10 m is 517.6 pm, which is 0.5176 nanometers. Hmm.

But the options don't have anything near 500 pm. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the steps again.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 6.1e6 m/s. Oh wait, protons at that speed would have relativistic effects? Because 6e6 m/s is about 2% the speed of light. Since c is ~3e8 m/s, 6e6 is 0.02c, which is non-relativistic. So we can safely ignore relativistic effects and use p=mv.

Hmm, maybe I made a calculation error in the exponent. Let me check the exponents again.

p = 1.67e-27 kg *6.1e6 m/s.

Multiply 1.67 *6.1 → as before, ~10.187.

Exponents: 1e-27 * 1e6 = 1e-21. So p=10.187e-21 kg m/s.

Δp = 0.0001 *10.187e-21 = 1.0187e-25 kg m/s.

Now, Planck's constant ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So Δx = ħ/(2 Δp) → (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1.0187e-25) → denominator is 2.0374e-25.

So 1.0545718e-34 / 2.0374e-25 = (1.0545718 / 2.0374) * 1e-9.

As before, 1.0545718 /2.0374 ≈ 0.5176, so 0.5176e-9 m → 5.176e-10 m → 517.6 pm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest higher is 52 pm, which is option C. Or wait, perhaps I have a decimal error. Wait, no, 5.17e-10 m is 517 pm. No option matches that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the exponents. Let me calculate 1e-34 divided by 1e-25.

Wait, 1e-34 / 1e-25 = 1e-9. So 1e-34 / 2.0374e-25 = (1/2.0374) * 1e-9.

Wait, 1/2.0374 is approximately 0.49. So 0.49e-9 m is 4.9e-10 m, which is 490 pm.

Wait, but earlier calculation with the exact numbers gave 517 pm, but even 490 is higher than any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Δp.

Wait, 0.0100% of p is 1.0187e-25 kg m/s. But wait, maybe I should have used a different value for the mass of the proton. Let me check that.

The mass of a proton is approximately 1.6726219e-27 kg. So I used 1.67e-27, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used exact values without approximating. Let me redo the calculation precisely.

Compute p: m=1.67e-27 kg, v=6.1e6 m/s.

p=1.67e-27 *6.1e6 = (1.67 *6.1) *1e-27+6 → 1e-21.

1.67 *6.1 = let me compute it exactly. 1.67 *6 = 10.02. 1.67 *0.1=0.167. So 10.02 +0.167=10.187. So p=10.187e-21 kg m/s.

Δp = 0.0001 *10.187e-21 = 1.0187e-25 kg m/s.

Now, ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

Δx= ħ/(2 Δp) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1.0187e-25) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2.0374e-25.

Compute 1.0545718e-34 / 2.0374e-25:

1.0545718 / 2.0374 = let me compute this division.

Let me write it out: 1.0545718 ÷ 2.0374.

2.0374 * 0.5 = 1.0187.

Subtract 1.0187 from 1.0545718: 1.0545718 -1.0187 =0.0358718.

Now, 0.0358718 ÷ 2.0374 ≈ let's compute that. 2.0374 * 0.0176 = approx 0.03584. So 0.0176.

So total is 0.5 +0.0176=0.5176.

So 0.5176e-9 m. Which is 5.176e-10 m, which is 517.6 pm.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for ħ? Let me check the value.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses h instead of ħ. Let me think. If I used h/(4π) instead of ħ/(2), what would happen?

Because the Heisenberg principle is often written as Δx Δp ≥ h/(4π). So if I used h/(4π) instead of ħ/2, let's compute that.

h is 6.62607015e-34 J s. So h/(4π) = 6.62607015e-34 / (4 *3.1415926536) ≈ 6.62607e-34 /12.56637 ≈ 5.273e-35 J s.

Wait, so Δx = h/(4π Δp) → 5.273e-35 / (1.0187e-25) → Wait, no, wait, Δx = h/(4π Δp) → 6.626e-34 / (4 * π * 1.0187e-25).

Compute 4 * π ≈12.566. So 6.626e-34 / (12.566 * 1.0187e-25) → denominator is 12.566 *1.0187e-25 ≈12.566 *1.0187 ≈12.8, so 12.8e-25.

So 6.626e-34 /12.8e-25 = (6.626 /12.8 ) * 1e-9.

6.626 /12.8 ≈0.5176. So 0.5176e-9 m again. So same result. So no difference whether I use h or ħ, as they should.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the uncertainty in position to be within a certain relative uncertainty, but I think I've handled that correctly.

Wait, maybe I messed up the percentage. 0.0100% is 0.0001. So 0.0001 times p is correct. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the momentum. Let me recompute p.

p= m*v =1.67e-27 kg *6.1e6 m/s.

Multiply 1.67 *6.1: 1.67 *6=10.02, 1.67 *0.1=0.167 → 10.187. So 10.187e-27+6 → 10.187e-21 kg m/s. Correct.

Hmm. So I'm getting 517 pm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the uncertainty in position to be tolerated so that the uncertainty in momentum is 0.01%, which is a very small uncertainty, so the position uncertainty must be large. But 517 pm is 5.17 angstroms, which is quite large for atomic scales, but perhaps that's correct.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest is option C:52 pm,
