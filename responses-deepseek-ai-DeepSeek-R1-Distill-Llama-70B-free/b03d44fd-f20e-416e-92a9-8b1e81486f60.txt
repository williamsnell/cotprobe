Okay, so I have this question about hormones involved in puberty changes for both females and males. Hmm, I remember that puberty is a big time for growth and development. So I need to think about which hormones are responsible for that.

I think the main hormones involved are the sex hormones. Like, for females, estrogen and progesterone are important because they regulate the menstrual cycle and develop female characteristics. But wait, don't males also have some of these? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Oh right, testosterone is the main male sex hormone, but females also have some testosterone. And males have small amounts of estrogen too. So during puberty, these hormones increase. But what triggers their release?

I remember something about the pituitary gland being involved. Oh yeah, the pituitary releases FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone). In females, FSH helps with follicle development in the ovaries, leading to estrogen release. LH triggers ovulation. In males, LH stimulates the testes to produce testosterone, and FSH is involved in sperm production.

So putting it all together, the hormones involved should include FSH, LH, estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. Let me look at the options.

Option H says exactly that: FSH, LH, estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. That makes sense. Other options don't fit as well. For example, option J is about thyroid hormones, which are more about metabolism. Option A is adrenal hormones, which I think are more related to stress and electrolytes.

So I think the correct answer is H.

The hormones involved in the changes during puberty for both females and males include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. These hormones regulate the development of secondary sexual characteristics and reproductive functions. FSH and LH are released by the pituitary gland, with FSH promoting follicle development in females and sperm production in males, while LH triggers ovulation in females and stimulates testosterone production in males. Estrogen and progesterone are key for female reproductive processes, while testosterone drives male development. Among the options provided, only option H lists these hormones.

Answer: H
