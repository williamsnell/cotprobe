Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to calculate the weight percent of a helium and argon mixture. Hmm, let me see. The problem says that we have 5.00 grams of helium and argon combined, right? The volume is 10.0 liters at 25°C and 1.00 atm.

Wait, wait. Oh right, it's a mixture, so maybe each gas contributes to the total pressure. But wait, no, the total pressure is given as 1 atm, so both are in the same volume and conditions.

I think I should use the ideal gas law here. PV = nRT. But wait, the problem gives the total mass, so maybe I should find the moles of each gas first.

Wait, but I don't have the individual masses of He and Ar, just the total mass is 5 grams. Hmm, so perhaps I need to find the moles of each based on their partial pressures or something.

Wait, the total volume is 10 liters, temperature is 25°C which is 298 K. Pressure is 1 atm. Let me write down the given data:

- Total mass (He + Ar) = 5.00 g
- Volume (V) = 10.0 L
- Temperature (T) = 25°C = 298 K
- Pressure (P) = 1.00 atm

I think I need to find the number of moles of each gas. But I'm not sure how to split it because I don't know the individual masses. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can model it by letting the mass of He be m, and Ar be 5 - m grams. Then find m such that the total pressure from both gases equals 1 atm.

So, for each gas, n = m/M, where M is molar mass. Helium's molar mass is about 4 g/mol, Argon is about 40 g/mol.

The ideal gas equation for each gas would be P = nRT/V. So the partial pressure of He would be (m/4) * R T / V, and similarly for Ar, it's ((5 - m)/40) * R T / V.

The sum of the partial pressures should equal the total pressure, 1 atm.

So equation: (m/4)*R T/V + ((5 - m)/40)*R T/V = P_total

Let me plug in the numbers. R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So,

(m/4) * 0.0821 * 298 / 10 + ((5 - m)/40) * 0.0821 * 298 / 10 = 1 atm

Simplify this equation to solve for m.

Let me compute the coefficients step by step.

First, calculate R*T/V: 0.0821 * 298 /10.

0.0821 * 298 ≈ let me compute 0.08 *300=24, but more accurately: 0.0821 * 298.

298 * 0.08 = 23.84, 298 * 0.0021= ~0.626, so total is 24.466.

Then divide by 10: 2.4466 atm·mol^{-1}.

Wait, wait, no: R*T/V is 0.0821 * 298 /10.

Ah, yes, 0.0821 * 298 = approx 24.4658, divided by 10 gives 2.44658.

So each term is multiplied by 2.44658.

So equation becomes:

(m/4) * 2.44658 + ((5 - m)/40) * 2.44658 = 1

Factor out 2.44658:

2.44658 [ (m/4) + (5 - m)/40 ) ] = 1

Let me compute the terms inside the brackets.

(m/4) + (5 - m)/40.

To add them, find a common denominator. Let's see, 40 is the LCD. So 10m/40 + (5 - m)/40 = [10m +5 -m ] /40 = (9m +5)/40.

So now, 2.44658 * (9m +5)/40 = 1.

Multiply both sides by 40:

2.44658 * (9m +5) = 40.

Divide both sides by 2.44658:

9m +5 = 40 / 2.44658 ≈ let me calculate that.

40 divided by approx 2.44658. Let me compute:

2.44658 * 16 = approx 39.145, which is close to 40. So 16.3 times.

Wait, more accurately: 2.44658 * 16 = 39.14528. The difference is 40 - 39.14528 = 0.85472.

0.85472 /2.44658 ≈ 0.349.

So 16 + 0.349 = 16.349.

So 9m +5 = 16.349.

Subtract 5: 9m = 11.349 → m=11.349/9≈1.261 g.

So mass of He is about 1.261 g, mass of Ar is 5 -1.261=3.739 g.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation steps because I might have made an error.

Wait, when I calculated 40 / 2.44658:

Let me compute 2.44658 × 16 = ?

2.44658 × 10 =24.4658

2.44658 ×6=14.67948 → total 24.4658 +14.67948=39.14528.

So 2.44658 ×16.349 = ?

Wait, 2.44658 × 0.349 = approx:

0.3 ×2.44658=0.73397

0.04×2.44658=0.09786

0.009×2.44658=0.022017

Total: 0.73397 +0.09786=0.83183 +0.022017≈0.85385.

So 16 ×2.44658=39.14528 → adding 0.349 ×2.44658 gives 39.14528 + 0.85385≈40.0.

So yes, 16.349 gives 40.

So 9m +5=16.349 → 9m=11.349 → m=1.261 grams.

So He is 1.261g, Ar is 5-1.261=3.739g.

Now, the weight percent is the mass of each divided by total mass (5g) multiplied by 100.

He's weight percent: (1.261 /5.00)*100 = 25.22%.

Ar: (3.739/5)*100=74.78%.

Looking at the options, option F says He:25.2%, Ar:74.8%.

So the answer should be F.

To calculate the weight percent of helium (He) and argon (Ar) in the mixture, we start by using the ideal gas law and the given conditions:

- Total mass of the mixture: \( 5.00 \, \text{g} \)
- Volume (\( V \)): \( 10.0 \, \text{L} \)
- Temperature (\( T \)): \( 25^\circ \text{C} = 298 \, \text{K} \)
- Pressure (\( P \)): \( 1.00 \, \text{atm} \)
- Molar mass of He: \( 4 \, \text{g/mol} \)
- Molar mass of Ar: \( 40 \, \text{g/mol} \)

Let the mass of He be \( m \), and the mass of Ar be \( 5 - m \). The number of moles of each gas is given by:

\[
n_{\text{He}} = \frac{m}{4}, \quad n_{\text{Ar}} = \frac{5 - m}{40}.
\]

Using the ideal gas law, the partial pressures of He and Ar are:

\[
P_{\text{He}} = \frac{n_{\text{He}} R T}{V}, \quad P_{\text{Ar}} = \frac{n_{\text{Ar}} R T}{V}.
\]

The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{He}} + P_{\text{Ar}}.
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( P_{\text{He}} \) and \( P_{\text{Ar}} \):

\[
\frac{m}{4} \cdot \frac{R T}{V} + \frac{5 - m}{40} \cdot \frac{R T}{V} = 1.
\]

Factoring out \( \frac{R T}{V} \):

\[
\frac{R T}{V} \left( \frac{m}{4} + \frac{5 - m}{40} \right) = 1.
\]

Simplify the terms inside the parentheses:

\[
\frac{m}{4} + \frac{5 - m}{40} = \frac{10m}{40} + \frac{5 - m}{40} = \frac{9m + 5}{40}.
\]

Substitute back:

\[
\frac{R T}{V} \cdot \frac{9m + 5}{40} = 1.
\]

Using \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \), \( T = 298 \, \text{K} \), and \( V = 10.0 \, \text{L} \):

\[
\frac{0.0821 \cdot 298}{10} \cdot \frac{9m + 5}{40} = 1.
\]

Calculate \( \frac{0.0821 \cdot 298}{10} \):

\[
\frac{0.0821 \cdot 298}{10} \approx 2.4466.
\]

Substitute this value:

\[
2.4466 \cdot \frac{9m + 5}{40} = 1.
\]

Multiply through by 40:

\[
2.4466 \cdot (9m + 5) = 40.
\]

Divide by 2.4466:

\[
9m + 5 = \frac{40}{2.4466} \approx 16.349.
\]

Solve for \( m \):

\[
9m = 16.349 - 5, \quad m = \frac{11.349}{9} \approx 1.261 \, \text{g}.
\]

Thus, the mass of He is \( 1.261 \, \text{g} \), and the mass of Ar is:

\[
5 - m = 5 - 1.261 = 3.739 \, \text{g}.
\]

The weight percent of each gas is:

\[
\text{Weight percent of He} = \frac{1.261}{5.00} \cdot 100 \approx 25.2\%, \quad \text{Weight percent of Ar} = \frac{3.739}{5.00} \cdot 100 \approx 74.8\%.
\]

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**F: Weight percent He = 25.2%, Weight percent Ar = 74.8%.**
