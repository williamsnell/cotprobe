Okay, so I have this polynomial, x³ - A x + 15, and it's given that it has three real roots. Two of these roots sum to 5, and I need to find the absolute value of A, which is |A|. Hmm, alright, let's think about how to approach this.

I remember that for a cubic polynomial of the form x³ + b x² + c x + d, the sum of the roots is -b, the sum of the products of the roots two at a time is c, and the product of the roots is -d. Wait, but in the given polynomial, the x² term is missing. So like, the polynomial is x³ - A x + 15, which can be written as x³ + 0 x² - A x + 15. So in standard form, that's x³ + b x² + c x + d, where b is 0, c is -A, and d is 15.

Let me denote the roots as r, s, and t. So according to Vieta's formulas:

1. r + s + t = -b = 0, since b is 0.
2. rs + rt + st = c = -A.
3. rst = -d = -15.

Wait, wait, I should make sure to get the signs right. Vieta's for cubic x³ + a x² + b x + c: sum is -a, sum of products two at a time is b, product is -c. So yeah, in this case, our polynomial is x³ + 0 x² + (-A)x + 15. So the sum of roots r + s + t = 0. Sum of products two at a time is r s + r t + s t = (-A). Product is r s t = -15.

The problem states that two of the roots sum to 5. Let's say r + s = 5. Then, from the sum r + s + t = 0, we can find t. So t = -(r + s) = -5.

So now, we have the three roots: r, s, and t=-5.

Now, let's apply the other Vieta equations. The sum of products two at a time is rs + rt + st = (-A). Let me compute this.

rs + r t + s t = rs + t(r + s). Since r + s is 5, and t is -5, substitute:

rs + (-5)(5) = rs - 25. And this equals -A.

So, rs -25 = -A → A = 25 - rs.

Next, the product of all three roots: r s t = -15. Since t is -5, this becomes r s (-5) = -15 → r s = (-15)/(-5) = 3.

So rs =3.

Now, substitute rs=3 into the equation for A: A=25 - rs=25-3=22.

Wait, that would make A=22. So |A| is 22, since A is positive 22. So the answer should be 22.0, but let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option G is 22.0. So the correct answer would be G.

Wait, but let me recheck the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

We had r + s =5, so t= -5. Then, the product r s t= -15 → r s (-5) = -15 → r s=3. Then, sum of products: rs + rt + st = 3 + r*(-5) + s*(-5) = 3 -5(r + s)= 3 -5*(5) = 3 -25 = -22. So this equals -A. So -22 = -A → A=22. So yes, |A|=22, which is option G.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the polynomial \(x^3 - A x + 15\) with roots \(r\), \(s\), and \(t\). Using Vieta's formulas, we know:

1. \(r + s + t = 0\) (since the coefficient of \(x^2\) is 0),
2. \(rs + rt + st = -A\),
3. \(rst = -15\).

The problem states that two of the roots sum to 5. Let \(r + s = 5\). From the first equation, \(r + s + t = 0\), we find \(t = -5\).

Next, we calculate the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time:
\[
rs + rt + st = rs + t(r + s).
\]
Substituting \(t = -5\) and \(r + s = 5\), we get:
\[
rs + (-5)(5) = rs - 25.
\]
From Vieta's formula, this equals \(-A\), so:
\[
rs - 25 = -A \quad \Rightarrow \quad A = 25 - rs.
\]

To find \(rs\), we use the product of the roots:
\[
rst = -15.
\]
Substituting \(t = -5\), we have:
\[
rs(-5) = -15 \quad \Rightarrow \quad rs = 3.
\]

Now substitute \(rs = 3\) into the equation for \(A\):
\[
A = 25 - rs = 25 - 3 = 22.
\]

Thus, \(|A| = 22\). Comparing this result to the options, the correct answer is **G: 22.0**.
