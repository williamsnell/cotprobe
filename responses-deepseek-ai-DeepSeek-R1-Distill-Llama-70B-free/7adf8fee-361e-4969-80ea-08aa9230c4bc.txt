Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. The question is about finding the sum of an infinite series. The series is the sum from n=1 to infinity of (1/e^n + 1/(n*(n+1))). Hmm, I remember that when a series is a sum of two terms, sometimes you can split it into two separate series and sum each part individually. So maybe I can split this into two separate sums: one for 1/e^n and another for 1/(n(n+1)).

Alright, first let's tackle the first part: sum_{n=1}^infty (1/e^n). I think this is a geometric series. The general form of a geometric series is sum_{n=0}^infty ar^n, where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. But wait, in this case, the exponent is e, so 1/e is the ratio. Let me adjust for the starting index. Oh right, the sum from n=1 to infinity of r^n is r/(1 - r), provided that |r| < 1.

So substituting r = 1/e, the sum becomes (1/e) / (1 - 1/e). Let me compute that. 1/(e) divided by (1 - 1/e) is the same as [1/e] * [e/(e - 1)] because the denominator becomes (e-1)/e. So when you divide by that, you multiply by e/(e-1). So [1/e] * [e/(e-1)] = 1/(e-1). Wait, yes, that's correct. So the sum of the first part is 1/(e-1).

Now the second part is sum_{n=1}^infty [1/(n(n+1))]. I remember that this is a telescoping series. Let me think about partial fractions. 1/(n(n+1)) can be written as A/n + B/(n+1). Solving for A and B: 1 = A(n+1) + Bn. Let me set up equations for A and B. When n = -1, 1 = B*(-1) → B = -1. When n=0, 1 = A(1) → A=1. So the decomposition is 1/n - 1/(n+1).

So the sum becomes sum_{n=1}^\infty [1/n - 1/(n+1)]. Let's write out the first few terms to see the pattern. For n=1: 1/1 - 1/2; n=2: 1/2 - 1/3; n=3: 1/3 - 1/4; and so on. Adding these up, most terms cancel out. The sum telescopes to (1 - 1/2) + (1/2 - 1/3) + (1/3 - 1/4) + ... So all the intermediate terms cancel, leaving just 1 - the limit as n approaches infinity of 1/(n+1). Since 1/(n+1) approaches zero, the sum is 1.

Wait, so the second sum is 1. So putting it all together, the total sum is the sum of the first series (1/(e-1)) plus 1. So total sum = 1 + 1/(e-1).

Wait, let me compute that numerically. Let's calculate each part. e is approximately 2.71828. So e-1 is about 1.71828. 1/(e-1) is approximately 0.58198. Adding 1 to that gives about 1.58198. Let me check the options given. Option D is 1.581, which matches this approximate value.

But wait another thought: did I split the series correctly? Because the original series is the sum of two terms, each summed from n=1 to infinity. So yes, splitting into two separate sums is valid because both converge. So the approach should be correct.

Alternatively, I can think about whether there's another way to approach the problem. Maybe combining the two terms first before summing, but that seems more complicated. No, splitting into two sums is the right way.

So the final sum is approximately 1.58198, which rounds to 1.582, but the option D is 1.581, which is close enough considering rounding. So the correct answer should be D.

The given problem involves finding the sum of the infinite series:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{e^n} + \frac{1}{n(n+1)} \right).
\]

To solve this, we split the series into two separate sums:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{e^n} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n(n+1)}.
\]

### First Series: \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{e^n}\)

This is a geometric series with the first term \(a = \frac{1}{e}\) and common ratio \(r = \frac{1}{e}\). The sum of a geometric series starting at \(n=1\) is given by:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} r^n = \frac{r}{1 - r}.
\]

Substituting \(r = \frac{1}{e}\):

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{e^n} = \frac{\frac{1}{e}}{1 - \frac{1}{e}} = \frac{1}{e-1}.
\]

### Second Series: \(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n(n+1)}\)

This is a telescoping series. Using partial fractions, we decompose:

\[
\frac{1}{n(n+1)} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1}.
\]

The series becomes:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1} \right).
\]

Writing out the first few terms:

\[
\left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} \right) + \left( \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} \right) + \dots
\]

Most terms cancel, leaving:

\[
1 - \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n+1} = 1 - 0 = 1.
\]

### Total Sum

Adding the two results:

\[
\frac{1}{e-1} + 1.
\]

Using \(e \approx 2.718\), we compute:

\[
\frac{1}{e-1} \approx \frac{1}{1.718} \approx 0.58198.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{e-1} + 1 \approx 0.58198 + 1 = 1.58198.
\]

This matches the option \(D: 1.581\).
