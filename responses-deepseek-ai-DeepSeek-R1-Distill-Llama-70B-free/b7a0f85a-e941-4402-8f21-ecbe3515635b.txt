Okay, so I've got this question about Company X wanting to acquire either Company A or B. The question gives some financial data for both companies, and there are three conditions that affect which company X should choose. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let's look at the data provided for both companies:

Company A:
- Total Assets: $1,000,000
- Sales: $3,000,000
- Gross profit: $300,000
- Net income: $96,000

Company B:
- Total Assets: $2,000,000
- Sales: $5,000,000
- Gross profit: $750,000
- Net income: $272,000

So, Company B is bigger in terms of assets and sales. But let's break this down further.

The three conditions are:
(a) X has strong admin but weak sales.
(b) X has strong sales but weak admin.
(c) X is looking for short-term profit improvement.

I think I need to determine which company would benefit more under each condition.

Starting with condition (a): X has strong administration but weak sales. So, maybe X needs a company that can help boost their sales. Or perhaps a company that doesn't require strong sales because their own sales are weak. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, if X has strong admin, that probably means they can handle the back-office stuff efficiently. So if they have weak sales, maybe they need a company that's good at generating sales. Or maybe they should acquire a company that's strong in sales so that X's strong admin can manage it efficiently.

Looking at the sales figures: Company B has higher sales ($5M vs $3M). So if X's sales are weak, acquiring Company B might help because B has strong sales. But wait, if X's sales are weak, perhaps they need a company that's not too dependent on sales. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe looking at profit margins. Let's compute some ratios.

Gross profit margin is gross profit divided by sales.

For A: 300,000 / 3,000,000 = 10%.
For B: 750,000 / 5,000,000 = 15%.

So B has a better gross margin. That suggests B is more efficient in production or purchasing.

Net profit margin is net income divided by sales.

A: 96,000 / 3,000,000 = 3.2%
B: 272,000 / 5,000,000 = 5.44%

Again, B is better here. So B is more profitable overall.

But how does this tie into the conditions?

Condition (a): Strong admin, weak sales. So maybe X's admin can improve the target company's operations. If X has strong admin, perhaps they can better manage a company that's not as well run. Or maybe they can improve the efficiency of the company they acquire.

If X's sales are weak, they might need a company with strong sales to boost their own top-line. Company B has higher sales, which could help with that.

Condition (b): Strong sales, weak admin. So X can sell well but maybe can't manage the company efficiently. So they might prefer a company that's well-managed (good admin) so that X's strong sales can take it further. Or perhaps a company that's not as administration-heavy.

Wait, but if X has weak admin, maybe they should acquire a company that doesn't require a lot of administrative effort. Or perhaps Company A, which has lower assets and maybe less complex operations.

Alternatively, if the target company has strong admin, then X's weak admin won't be a problem because the target's admin is solid. So maybe in condition (b), X should acquire a company with strong admin. But I don't have data on the target's admin strength. Hmm.

Wait, maybe looking at the net profit. Company B has higher net income, which might indicate better overall management (since they have higher sales and higher profits). So if X has weak admin, perhaps Company B has strong admin, so X can leverage that.

Wait, but how? If X's admin is weak, maybe they should acquire a company that is more sales-oriented, which would play into their strength. So Company B has higher sales, so maybe better fit with X's strong sales.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to approach this differently.

Under condition (a): X's strong admin can handle a company that might have weaker admin, but perhaps needs better management. Or maybe a company that's asset-heavy? Because Company B has higher assets. Alternatively, maybe a company with lower sales but higher margins.

Wait, but Company B has better margins and higher sales. So if X has weak sales, maybe acquiring B would bring in more sales. Because X's sales are weak, but B's are strong. So perhaps in condition (a), X should acquire B.

Wait, but if X has strong admin, they might be better at managing a company that's asset-heavy. Company B has twice the assets of A, so maybe A is easier to manage. Or maybe B's higher assets mean more potential for X to improve with their strong admin.

Alternatively, perhaps looking at the return on assets (ROA). ROA is net income divided by total assets.

For A: 96,000 / 1,000,000 = 9.6%
For B: 272,000 / 2,000,000 = 13.6%

So B has a better ROA. That suggests that B is more efficient in using its assets to generate profit. So if X has strong admin, which can manage assets well, maybe they can improve B even more, but B is already better. Hmm.

Wait, maybe if X has strong admin, they can improve A's admin. Because A might have weaker admin. If X's admin is strong, they can turn around A's operations, perhaps increasing A's profitability. Because A's ROA is lower than B's. So maybe A has more potential for improvement.

Wait, but the question is about whether to acquire A or B based on X's strengths and weaknesses.

So for condition (a): X has strong admin, weak sales.

If X's sales are weak, then perhaps they need a company that can boost their sales. Company B has higher sales. So acquiring B would bring in more sales, which X needs because their own sales are weak. So in condition (a), X should acquire B.

Alternatively, if X's admin is strong, maybe they can improve a company that's not as well run. So perhaps Company A is less efficient and X can improve it. But B is already more efficient, so perhaps it's better to get B.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me move to condition (c) first and then come back.

Condition (c): X is looking for short-term improvement in profits. So which company would give a quicker profit boost?

Looking at net income, B has $272k vs A's $96k. So acquiring B would add more to X's net income in the short term. So condition (c) would point to B.

Now, condition (b): X has strong sales force but weak admin. So they can sell well but perhaps can't manage the company's operations efficiently.

If X has strong sales, they might want a company that's well-managed (since their admin is weak), so that the target company's admin can handle the operational side. Or perhaps a company that's not as administration-heavy.

Alternatively, if X has strong sales, maybe they can take a company with good products but weaker sales and boost its sales. But in this case, Company B already has strong sales.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused again. Let me think about the net profit margins. Company B has higher margins. So maybe if X has weak admin, they can't improve the target's operations much, so they should pick a company that's already efficient. So Company B is more efficient, so perhaps X should acquire B in this case as well.

Wait, but if X's admin is weak, maybe they should pick a company with simpler operations, which might be Company A. Because Company A has fewer assets and lower sales, so maybe it's easier to manage.

Alternatively, maybe with strong sales, X can improve Company A's sales. Because Company A's sales are $3M, which is lower than B's $5M. But if X has a strong sales force, they might be able to boost A's sales more than they could boost B's, which is already high. So perhaps in condition (b), X should acquire A.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if X has strong sales, they could take Company A, which has lower sales, and increase A's sales, thus improving A's profitability. Since A's gross margin is lower, maybe with better sales, the net income would rise more for A than for B, which is already selling a lot.

So for condition (a): X has strong admin (so can manage a more complex company) and weak sales (so needs a company with strong sales to boost their own). So acquiring B would help with that.

For condition (b): X has strong sales (so can boost a company's sales) and weak admin (so can't manage a complex company well). So perhaps they should acquire A, which has lower sales but is smaller and easier to manage, and use their strong sales force to increase A's sales and thus profits.

For condition (c): Short-term profits. B has higher net income, so acquiring B would give a quicker profit boost.

So summarizing:

(a) Condition (a): B

(b) Condition (b): A

(c) Condition (c): B

Now, looking at the options:

The options are combinations for (a), (b), (c). Each option lists the choice for each condition in order a, b, c.

Looking at the options:

Option F: B, A, B → which matches what I thought.

Option J: B, B, A → no, because condition (c) would be B.

Option E: B, B, B → no, condition (b) would be A.

Option G: A, B, B → no.

Option H: B, A, A → no.

Option F: B, A, B → yes, this matches.

So the correct answer should be option F: B, A, B.

Wait, but let me check again.

Condition (a): X has strong admin and weak sales. So they need a company with strong sales, which is B. So condition (a) is B.

Condition (b): X has strong sales and weak admin. So they need a company that's easier to manage (smaller) and can have their sales boosted. So A. So condition (b) is A.

Condition (c): Short-term profits. B is better. So condition (c) is B.

So the order is B, A, B. Looking at the options, option F is (B, A, B).

To determine which company Company X should acquire under the given conditions, we analyze the financial data and align it with the strengths and weaknesses of Company X.

### Financial Data Analysis:
- **Company A**:  
  - Total Assets: $1,000,000  
  - Sales: $3,000,000  
  - Gross Profit: $300,000 (10% margin)  
  - Net Income: $96,000 (3.2% margin)  
  - ROA: 9.6%  

- **Company B**:  
  - Total Assets: $2,000,000  
  - Sales: $5,000,000  
  - Gross Profit: $750,000 (15% margin)  
  - Net Income: $272,000 (5.44% margin)  
  - ROA: 13.6%  

### Key Observations:
1. **Company B** has higher sales, gross profit, and net income compared to Company A, indicating stronger financial performance.  
2. **Company B** also has better gross and net profit margins, as well as a higher ROA, suggesting greater efficiency in operations.  
3. **Company A**, while smaller, may offer more potential for improvement if Company X can address its weaknesses.  

### Condition Analysis:
1. **Condition (a):**  
   - Company X has strong administration but weak sales.  
   - Acquiring **Company B**, which has strong sales and higher profitability, would complement X's strong administration and address its sales weakness.  

2. **Condition (b):**  
   - Company X has strong sales but weak administration.  
   - Acquiring **Company A**, which is smaller and less complex, would allow X to leverage its strong sales force to boost A's sales without being overwhelmed by administrative challenges.  

3. **Condition (c):**  
   - Company X is looking for short-term improvement in profits.  
   - **Company B**, with its higher net income and better margins, would provide a quicker profit boost compared to Company A.  

### Conclusion:
- **Condition (a):** Acquire **Company B**.  
- **Condition (b):** Acquire **Company A**.  
- **Condition (c):** Acquire **Company B**.  

The correct option that aligns with these choices is **Option F: B, A, B**.
