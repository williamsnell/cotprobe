Okay, so I've got this integral to solve: the integral from 0 to sqrt(3) of dx/(1 + x²). Hmm, I remember that the integral of 1/(1+x²) dx is something to do with arctangent. Let me think, yeah, the antiderivative should be arctan(x) plus a constant because the derivative of arctan(x) is 1/(1+x²). So I can use the fundamental theorem of calculus here.

So, the definite integral from 0 to sqrt(3) would be arctan(sqrt(3)) minus arctan(0). Wait, what's arctan(sqrt(3))? I remember that tan(π/3) is sqrt(3), right? Because in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are 1, sqrt(3), 2. So the angle opposite sqrt(3) is 60 degrees, which is π/3 radians. So arctan(sqrt(3)) is π/3.

And arctan(0), well that's 0 because tan(0) is 0. So putting it all together, the integral should be π/3 - 0, which is π/3. 

Now, I need to look at the options. Let's see what each option is numerically. I remember that π is approximately 3.1416, so π/3 would be about 1.0472. Looking through the choices:

Option C is 1.0472. Option G is 1.5708, which is π/2. Option E is 2.3562, which is 3π/4. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait a second, did I make any mistake here? Let me double-check. The integral of 1/(1+x²) is definitely arctan(x). Evaluated from 0 to sqrt(3) gives arctan(sqrt(3)) which is π/3, yes. So yes, the answer is option C.

The integral to solve is:

\[
\int_{0}^{\sqrt{3}} \frac{dx}{1+x^2}.
\]

The antiderivative of \(\frac{1}{1+x^2}\) is \(\arctan(x)\). Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral is:

\[
\arctan(x) \Big|_{0}^{\sqrt{3}} = \arctan(\sqrt{3}) - \arctan(0).
\]

We know that \(\arctan(\sqrt{3}) = \frac{\pi}{3}\) because \(\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sqrt{3}\), and \(\arctan(0) = 0\). Therefore, the integral evaluates to:

\[
\frac{\pi}{3} - 0 = \frac{\pi}{3}.
\]

Numerically, \(\frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472\). Comparing this with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: 1.0472.**
