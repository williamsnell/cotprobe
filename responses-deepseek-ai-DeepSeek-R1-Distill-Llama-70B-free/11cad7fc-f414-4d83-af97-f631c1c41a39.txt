The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A grantor conveyed his property to his son "for life, remainder after (the son's) death to his heirs. " Two years later, the son entered into a real estate agreement for the sale of the property to his friend, whereby the son agreed to convey the premises to his friend in fee simple absolute. Prior to the settlement date, the friend contacted the son, telling him that he would not perform his part of the agreement because the son could not convey a fee simple. If the Rule in Shelley's Case is followed in this jurisdiction, the outcome of a suit by the son for specific performance of the real estate contract would result in

Options:

A: the son's succeeding, because the son's conveyance of his life estate to the friend divested the contingent remainder of his heirs.
B: the son's not succeeding, because his heirs have to join in the transaction in order to convey marketable title.
C: the son's succeeding, because the son's life estate merged with the contingent remainder to his heirs, creating a fee simple.
D: the son's succeeding, because he had a fee simple to convey.
E: the son's not succeeding, because he could not convey marketable title.
F: the son's not succeeding, because the Rule in Shelley's Case invalidates the remainder to his heirs.
G: the son's not succeeding, as the friend was correct in asserting that the son could not convey a fee simple.
H: the son's succeeding, as the grantor's initial conveyance was implicitly in fee simple absolute.
I: the son's not succeeding, as the property was only granted to him for life.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with the Rule in Shelley's Case. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let me read the question carefully. The scenario is about a grantor conveying property to his son for life, with a remainder to the son's heirs after his death. Then, two years later, the son tries to sell the property to his friend in fee simple absolute. The friend backs out, claiming the son can't convey a fee simple. The question is about whether the son can get specific performance of the contract.

Hmm, I remember that the Rule in Shelley's Case is an old common law rule. From what I recall, the Rule applies when a grantor creates a life estate in a grantee and also gives a remainder to the grantee's heirs. The Rule says that if the same person has a life estate and a remainder, and the remainder is in "heirs" (which could be class gifts), the life estate and the remainder merge, creating a fee simple absolute. But wait, that only happens if the remainder is immediate and is in the same grantee's heirs. So if the son has a life estate and a remainder to his heirs, does that mean the son ends up with a fee simple?

Wait, let me think again. The grant is "to son for life, remainder to his heirs." So the son is the life tenant, and the remainder is to his own heirs. So under Shelley's Case, the son's life estate would merge with the remainder, giving him a fee simple absolute. Because the remainder is in the same grantee (the son's heirs), so the two estates merge, and the life estate is swallowed up by the remainder, creating a fee simple.

So if that's the case, the son actually holds a fee simple, not just a life estate. Therefore, when he contracted to sell the property in fee simple, he was capable of doing so because he actually owned it in fee. So when the friend says he can't convey a fee simple, that's incorrect. Therefore, the son could enforce specific performance.

Wait, but the options are a bit tricky. Let me look at the options.

Option A says the son's conveyance of his life estate divested the contingent remainder. But if under Shelley's Case the son already has a fee simple, then when he sells, he's conveying the fee, not just a life estate. So maybe A isn't correct because the son isn't just conveying a life estate; he's conveying the entire fee.

Option C says the son's life estate merged with the contingent remainder, creating a fee. So that's exactly what Shelley's Case does. So if that's the case, the son can convey the fee, so he can get specific performance. So C would be correct.

Option D says he had a fee simple. That's also correct if Shelley applies, but the reasoning is the same as C.

Wait, the options are a bit confusing. Let me check the options again.

Option C: son's succeeding because his life estate merged with the contingent remainder, creating a fee. So yes, that's exactly the Rule in Shelley's Case.

Option D: son's succeeding because he had a fee simple to convey. That's also correct, but perhaps the reasoning is different. Maybe D is correct as well, but the reasoning in C is the Shelley's Case application.

Wait, but the question is about the outcome when the Rule in Shelley's Case is followed. So the correct reasoning would involve the merger under Shelley's Case.

So the outcome is that the son actually owns the fee simple, so he can convey it. So the friend's objection is wrong, and the son can get specific performance.

Looking at the options, option C says the son succeeds because the merger created a fee. So that's correct.

Option E says he couldn't convey marketable title. But if he has a fee, then he can, so E is incorrect.

Option G says the friend was correct, so that's wrong.

So the correct answer should be C.

The question revolves around the application of the Rule in Shelley's Case, which governs the merger of a life estate and a remainder in the same person. In this scenario, the grantor conveyed the property to the son "for life, remainder after (the son's) death to his heirs." Under the Rule in Shelley's Case, when a grantor creates a life estate in a grantee and also devises a remainder to the grantee's heirs, the life estate and the remainder merge, creating a fee simple absolute in the grantee. This is because the remainder is immediate and in the same person (the grantee's heirs), leading to the merger of the two estates.

Given this, the son held a fee simple absolute, not merely a life estate. When the son entered into a contract to sell the property in fee simple absolute, he had the legal capacity to convey the entire interest in the property. The friend's assertion that the son could not convey a fee simple was incorrect because the son, in fact, owned the fee simple due to the merger under Shelley's Case. Therefore, the son could enforce specific performance of the contract.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because the son was not merely conveying a life estate; he conveyed the entire fee simple.
- **Option B** is incorrect because the heirs did not need to join in the transaction, as the son already held the fee simple.
- **Option C** is correct because the life estate merged with the contingent remainder under Shelley's Case, creating a fee simple absolute, which the son could convey.
- **Option D** is also correct in stating the son had a fee simple, but it does not explicitly reference the merger under Shelley's Case, which is the key legal reasoning here.
- **Option E** is incorrect because the son could convey marketable title as the holder of a fee simple.
- **Option F** is incorrect because the Rule in Shelley's Case does not invalidate the remainder; it merges the life estate and remainder.
- **Option G** is incorrect because the friend's assertion was wrong; the son could convey a fee simple.
- **Option H** is incorrect because the grantor's conveyance was explicitly for life with a remainder, not in fee simple absolute.
- **Option I** is incorrect because the grant to the son for life was transformed into a fee simple under Shelley's Case.

The best answer is **Option C**, as it directly addresses the merger under Shelley's Case, which is the legal basis for the son's ability to convey the fee simple. 

Answer: C
