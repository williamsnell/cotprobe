Okay, so I have this question about Bob Gafney and Susan Medina investing in a luncheonette, and I need to figure out how the net income is divided between them. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. Bob invested $40,000 and Susan $50,000. Bob is the manager, so he gets 4% of the net income. Each partner also gets 6% interest on their investment. The remaining net income is split equally between them. The net income for the year is $28,600. I need to find out how this amount is divided between Bob and Susan.

So, the total net income is $28,600. Let's outline the steps:

1. Calculate Bob's management fee: 4% of net income.
2. Calculate each partner's interest on their investment: 6% of their respective investments.
3. Subtract these two amounts from the total net income to find the remaining amount.
4. Split this remaining amount equally between Bob and Susan.
5. Add up each person's total income from all sources.

Let me do each part step by step.

First, the management fee. 4% of $28,600. To calculate that, 0.04 * 28600. Let me compute that. 4% of 28,600 is 1,144. So Bob gets $1,144 from the management fee.

Next, each gets 6% interest on their investment. Bob invested $40k, so 6% of 40,000 is 0.06 * 40000 = 2,400. Susan's investment is $50k, so 0.06 *50000=3,000. So Bob gets another $2,400, and Susan gets $3,000 from interest.

Now, let's sum up what's been allocated so far. Management fee is $1,144 for Bob. Interest: Bob gets $2,400 and Susan gets $3,000. So total allocated is 1,144 + 2,400 +3,000 = 6,544.

Wait, no. Because the management fee and the interest are separate allocations. So the total allocated is 1,144 + (2,400 +3,000) = 1,144 +5,400 =6,544. So the remaining net income is 28,600 - 6,544 = 22,056.

Wait, no. Because the total net income is 28,600. The management fee is taken first, then the interest, and then the remainder is split. So first subtract the management fee and the interest.

Wait, no, let me make sure. Because the problem says: each partner receives 6% interest on their investment. Then any remaining net income is divided equally. Also, Bob gets 4% of net income as management fee.

Wait, perhaps the order is: first, management fee is taken out, then the interest is calculated on their investments, and then the rest is split equally.

But let me think: the net income is $28,600. From this, the first deduction is the 4% management fee to Bob. Then, the interest on investments is calculated. But wait, perhaps the interest is based on their initial investment, regardless of the net income. So the interest is fixed, not based on the net income. So the steps would be:

1. Management fee: Bob gets 4% of $28,600 = $1,144.
2. Interest: Bob gets 6% of 40,000 = $2,400. Susan gets 6% of 50,000 = $3,000.
3. Now, the total allocated is 1,144 + 2,400 + 3,000 = $6,544.
4. Subtract that from the total net income: 28,600 -6,544= $22,056.
5. This remaining $22,056 is divided equally between Bob and Susan, so each gets half. Half of 22,056 is 11,028.

So now, let's compute each person's total income.

Bob's income:
- Management fee: $1,144
- Interest: $2,400
- Share of remaining: $11,028
Total for Bob: 1,144 +2,400=3,544 +11,028=14,572.

Susan's income:
- Interest: $3,000
- Share of remaining: $11,028
Total for Susan: 3,000 +11,028=14,028.

Wait, but let me check the math again. Because 1,144 +2,400 is 3,544. Plus 11,028 is 14,572 for Bob. Susan has 3k +11,028=14,028.

Looking at the options, option C says Mr. Gafney's income is $14,572 and Ms. Medina's is $15,028. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the remaining amount. Let me recalculate.

Total net income: $28,600.

Management fee: 4% of 28,600 is 1,144.

Interest: Bob gets 6% of 40,000=2,400; Susan gets 6% of 50,000=3,000.

So, total deductions before splitting: 1,144 (management) +2,400 (Bob's interest) +3,000 (Susan's interest) =6,544.

So remaining is 28,600 -6,544 =22,056. Split equally, so each gets 11,028.

So Bob's total: 1,144 +2,400 +11,028 =14,572.

Susan's total:3,000 +11,028=14,028.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F says Mr. Gafney:14,572 and Ms. Medina:14,028. So that would be option F.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A: Bob 12.6k, Susan 16k.

B: Bob 14k, Susan 14.6k.

C: Bob 14,572; Susan 15,028.

D: Bob 15,572; Susan 13,028.

E: Bob 16k; Susan 12.6k.

F: Bob 14,572; Susan14,028.

G: Bob 15,300; Susan13,300.

H: Bob 13,300; Susan15,300.

I: Bob14,600; Susan14k.

J: Bob13,572; Susan15,028.

So according to my calculation, the correct division is Bob:14,572 and Susan:14,028, which is option F.

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes these problems can be tricky with the order of operations. Like, perhaps the interest is calculated after the management fee is taken out. Wait, no, the interest is based on their investment, which is fixed. So the interest is regardless of the net income. So the initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6% interest is calculated on the initial investment, which is correct. So let me try another approach.

Another way: The total net income is $28,600.

First, Bob gets 4% as management fee: 0.04*28600=1,144.

Then, the interest is calculated: Bob gets 6% of 40,000=2,400; Susan 6% of50,000=3,000.

So total for Bob from management and interest:1,144+2,400=3,544.

Susan gets 3,000 from interest.

Now, the remaining income is 28,600 - (1,144+2,400+3,000) =28,600 -6,544=22,056.

Split this 22,056 equally: each gets 11,028.

So Bob's total:3,544+11,028=14,572.

Susan's total:3,000+11,028=14,028.

Yes, that's correct. So option F.

To determine how the net income of $28,600 is divided between Bob Gafney and Susan Medina, we follow these steps:

1. **Management Fee**: Bob receives 4% of the net income as a management fee.  
   \[
   0.04 \times 28,600 = 1,144
   \]

2. **Interest on Investments**: Each partner receives 6% interest on their respective investments.  
   - Bob's interest:  
     \[
     0.06 \times 40,000 = 2,400
     \]  
   - Susan's interest:  
     \[
     0.06 \times 50,000 = 3,000
     \]

3. **Total Allocated Amounts**:  
   The total amount allocated so far is the sum of the management fee and the interest payments:  
   \[
   1,144 + 2,400 + 3,000 = 6,544
   \]

4. **Remaining Net Income**: Subtract the allocated amounts from the total net income:  
   \[
   28,600 - 6,544 = 22,056
   \]  
   This remaining amount is divided equally between Bob and Susan:  
   \[
   \frac{22,056}{2} = 11,028
   \]

5. **Total Income for Each Partner**:  
   - Bob's total income:  
     \[
     1,144 \, (\text{management fee}) + 2,400 \, (\text{interest}) + 11,028 \, (\text{remaining income}) = 14,572
     \]  
   - Susan's total income:  
     \[
     3,000 \, (\text{interest}) + 11,028 \, (\text{remaining income}) = 14,028
     \]

Thus, Bob Gafney's income is $14,572, and Susan Medina's income is $14,028. The correct answer is:

**F: Mr. Gafney's income is $14,572 and Ms. Medina's income is $14,028.**
