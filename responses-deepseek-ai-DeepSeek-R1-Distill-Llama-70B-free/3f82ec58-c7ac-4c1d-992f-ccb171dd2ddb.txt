Question:

This question refers to the following information.
On Being Brought from Africa to America
'Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land,
Taught my benighted soul to understand
That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too;
Once I redemption neither sought nor knew.
Some view our sable race with scornful eye,
"Their colour is a diabolic die."
Remember, Christians, Negroes, black as Cain,
May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.

Okay, so I've got this question about Phillis Wheatley's poem and the ideas influencing it. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on 18th-century American literature, but I'll try to think it through.

The poem is "On Being Brought from Africa to America." From what I remember, Phillis Wheatley was the first African American to publish a book of poetry. Her work often dealt with themes of race, religion, and freedom.

Looking at the poem, the first stanza talks about being brought from a pagan land and taught about God and a Saviour. So she's referencing her conversion to Christianity. The second part addresses people who look down on her race, calling their color a "diabolic die," but she counters that black people can be refined and join the angels. So she's asserting her equality in a spiritual sense.

Now, the question is about the influence on her ideas. The options are various historical movements and ideas. Let's go through them:

A: John Locke's natural rights theory. Locke was an Enlightenment thinker who talked about life, liberty, and property. I'm not sure if that's directly reflected here. The poem is more about spiritual equality rather than political rights.

B: British social hierarchy ideas. The British had a class system, but the poem seems to challenge racial scorn, not class. Maybe, but I'm not certain.

C: Romantic movement. That came later, more like early 19th century, so probably not influencing her in 1773.

D: First Great Awakening. That was a religious revival in the 1730s-40s, emphasizing personal conversion and salvation. The poem's focus on redemption and spiritual matters might align with that.

E: Transcendentalism. That's even later, mid-19th century. No connection here.

F: American Revolution. The Revolution was happening around that time, but the poem doesn't directly talk about political independence, more about personal spirituality and race.

G: Second Great Awakening. That was in the early 19th century, so after her time. Not this one.

H: 18th-century scientific racism. That started to develop, but the poem is arguing against such views, not influenced by them. So probably not the answer.

I: Enlightenment philosophy. The Enlightenment emphasized reason, individual rights, and intellectual pursuits. It also influenced the Great Awakening, actually. But her poem seems more directly tied to religious themes than Enlightenment ideas.

J: Abolitionist movement. The abolitionists were more active in the 19th century, though early movements existed. But in 1773, the movement wasn't as prominent. Her poem doesn't explicitly call for abolition but rather for spiritual equality.

So, the poem's themes of conversion, salvation, and spiritual equality seem to align with the First Great Awakening. That movement emphasized that all people could have a personal relationship with God, regardless of background. Wheatley's poem reflects that idea, asserting that despite her race, she can join the "angelic train," meaning she is equal in God's eyes.

Wait, but the Enlightenment also influenced ideas about equality. But the religious focus here points more to the Great Awakening. Because the poem is about religious redemption and equality through faith, not so much about rational or scientific ideas.

Yes, so the influence is likely from the First Great Awakening.

The poem "On Being Brought from Africa to America" by Phillis Wheatley reflects themes of spiritual redemption, personal conversion, and the assertion of equality in a religious context. These ideas align most closely with the First Great Awakening, a religious revival of the 1730s-1740s that emphasized personal salvation, spiritual equality, and the idea that all individuals could have a direct relationship with God regardless of their background. While other movements like the Enlightenment or early abolitionist ideas might touch on equality, the poem's focus on religious themes and spiritual refinement points directly to the influence of the First Great Awakening.
