Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about power series and their intervals of convergence. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given intervals are valid. Let me think through each option carefully.

The question lists four intervals: I, II, III, IV. And the options are combinations of these. I remember that the interval of convergence for a power series is determined by the radius of convergence and the center. The general form is (a - R, a + R), where 'a' is the center and R is the radius.

Wait, but the endpoints can be included or excluded depending on the convergence there. So the interval could be open, closed, or half-open. Also, the radius of convergence could be zero, which would make the interval just a single point.

Let me analyze each interval:

I. [−1, 3) – So this is from -1 inclusive to 3 exclusive. The length is 4, so the radius would be 2, and the center at 1. That makes sense because the center is halfway between -1 and 3. So yes, this is a valid interval. The series would converge conditionally or absolutely at -1 but not at 3.

II. (−∞, 0] – This is everything from negative infinity up to and including 0. The radius here would be infinity because the lower bound is negative infinity. Wait, but the center would be at 0. So the radius of convergence is infinity, meaning the series converges everywhere. Oh wait, but if the radius is infinity, the interval is from -infinity to +infinity. But this interval stops at 0. That doesn't make sense. Because if the radius is infinity, the interval should include everything. Alternatively, maybe it's a power series centered at negative infinity? No, that's not possible. Wait, no, the center must be a finite point. So if the center is at 0, and radius is infinity, the interval would be (-infinity, infinity). But option II is (-infty, 0], which is only the left side. That can't be right. Unless the radius is zero, but that would only include the center. Hmm, maybe I'm confused here.

Wait, no, because if the radius is R, then the interval is (a - R, a + R). So if the interval is (-infty, 0], that would require a - R = -infty, which isn't possible because 'a' and R are finite. So I think interval II is not possible. Wait, unless the radius is infinity, but then the interval would be (-infty, +infty). So II can't be valid.

Wait, but what if the power series is centered at 0 and has radius of convergence infinity? Then the interval would be all real numbers, which is IV. So II can't be a valid interval of convergence because it's only up to 0, not extending to infinity on both ends.

III. [2,2] ∪ [3,3] – Wait, this looks like two single points. So each is a closed interval, so [2,2] is just the point 2, and [3,3] is just 3. So the interval of convergence is two separate points. But how can that be? The interval of convergence is an interval around the center. The only way to have separate points is if the radius is zero. Because if R=0, then the interval is just the center point. But here, it's two separate points. So that would imply that the radius is zero but the center is both 2 and 3, which isn't possible. So this can't be a valid interval. Unless the series converges only at 2 and 3, but that's not how power series work. The convergence is on an interval around a single center. So III doesn't seem valid.

IV. (−∞, ∞) – This is the entire real line. That happens when the radius of convergence is infinite, so the series converges everywhere. That's definitely a valid interval. So IV is correct.

Wait, let me check again. So:

I is valid because it's a finite interval with endpoints included and excluded.

II is invalid because it doesn't extend to positive infinity if the radius is infinity. Or if the radius is finite, the interval should be around the center, not stopping at 0 unless the radius is such that a + R =0. Wait, maybe if the center is at some point, say a, and R is such that a - R = negative infinity, but that's impossible. Alternatively, if the series is centered at 0 and the radius is infinity, the interval is all real numbers, which is IV. So II can't be valid.

III is invalid because you can't have two separate points as an interval of convergence. The interval must be a single connected interval, unless perhaps in some special cases, but I don't think that's possible. So III is invalid.

So among the four:

I: valid

II: invalid

III: invalid

IV: valid

So which options include only I and IV?

Looking at the options:

Option E: (I) and (IV) → correct.

Option C: (I), (III), (IV) → but III is invalid, so no.

Option F: (II) and (IV) → II is invalid, so no.

Option G: Only IV → misses I.

Wait, but let me double-check about interval I. It's [−1, 3). That's a half-open interval. That makes sense if the series converges at x=-1 but diverges at x=3. So I could be a valid interval of convergence.

So the valid intervals are I and IV.

So looking back at the options, option E is (I) and (IV), which would be correct.

Wait, but initially I thought that II is invalid. So the correct answer is option E.

To determine which intervals are valid for the convergence of a power series, we analyze each interval based on the properties of power series. The interval of convergence is determined by the radius of convergence \( R \) and the center \( a \), and it is typically of the form \( (a - R, a + R) \). The endpoints can be included or excluded depending on the convergence at those points. Additionally, the radius of convergence can be infinite, leading to convergence everywhere, or zero, leading to convergence only at the center.

### Analysis of Each Interval:
1. **Interval (I): \([-1, 3)\)**  
   This is a finite interval with the left endpoint included and the right endpoint excluded. This is valid because it represents a power series with a finite radius of convergence \( R = 2 \) and center \( a = 1 \). The series converges at \( x = -1 \) but diverges at \( x = 3 \).  
   **Conclusion:** Valid.

2. **Interval (II): \((-\infty, 0]\)**  
   This interval extends from negative infinity to 0, including 0. For this to be valid, the radius of convergence would need to be infinite, but the interval does not extend to positive infinity. A power series with an infinite radius of convergence would have an interval of convergence \((-\infty, \infty)\), not \((-\infty, 0]\).  
   **Conclusion:** Invalid.

3. **Interval (III): \([2, 2] \cup [3, 3]\)**  
   This represents two isolated points, 2 and 3. A power series converges on an interval around its center, not as two disconnected points. The only way for the interval of convergence to consist of isolated points is if the radius of convergence is zero, but this would only include the center, not two separate points.  
   **Conclusion:** Invalid.

4. **Interval (IV): \((-\infty, \infty)\)**  
   This represents convergence across the entire real line, which occurs when the radius of convergence is infinite. This is a valid interval of convergence.  
   **Conclusion:** Valid.

### Final Answer:
The valid intervals are (I) and (IV). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**E: (I) and (IV)**
