Okay, so I've got this math problem here: What is the quotient of 1,248 divided by 7? And there are multiple-choice options from A to J. I'm a bit rusty on my division, but I think I can figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that when you divide a number by another, you're looking to see how many times the divisor (which is 7 here) fits into the dividend (1,248). The result will be a quotient and possibly a remainder if it doesn't divide evenly.

Let me write this out. I need to calculate 1,248 ÷ 7. Maybe I should do long division because that's the method I learned in school. So, setting it up:

7 | 1248

I think I start by seeing how many times 7 goes into the first digit. But wait, the first digit is 1, and 7 is bigger than 1, so I take the first two digits, which is 12. How many times does 7 go into 12? Let me think: 7 times 1 is 7, 7 times 2 is 14. Oh wait, 14 is bigger than 12, so it must be 1 time. So I write 1, multiply 7 by 1 to get 7, subtract that from 12, and get 5.

Now, bring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 54. How many times does 7 go into 54? Hmm, 7 times 7 is 49, and 7 times 8 is 56. Oh, 56 is too big, so it's 7 times. 7 times 7 is 49. Subtract that from 54, and I get 5.

Bring down the next digit, which is 8, making it 58. How many times does 7 go into 58? Let's see, 7 times 8 is 56, and 7 times 9 is 63, which is too big. So it's 8 times. 7 times 8 is 56. Subtracting that from 58 gives a remainder of 2.

Putting it all together, the quotient is 177 and the remainder is 3? Wait, no, wait. Let me check my steps again. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, when I had 58, I subtracted 56, which leaves 2. So the remainder is 2, not 3. So the quotient is 177 and remainder 2. Or wait, no, wait—did I count the digits correctly?

Wait no, let me go through it again to be sure. So 7 into 12 is 1, subtract 7, remainder 5. Bring down 4 to make 54. 7 into 54 is 7 times (because 7*7=49), subtract 49, remainder 5. Bring down 8 to make 58. 7 into 58 is 8 times (7*8=56), subtract 56, remainder 2. So yes, the remainder is 2, and the quotient is 177. So that's 177 with a remainder of 2.

Looking back at the options, let's see which one matches. Option A is 168 rem 2, which is too low. Option B is 178 rem 2—wait, but I got 177. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the number of times? Let me see. Oh wait, when I was dividing 58 by 7, I said 8 times, which is correct because 7*8=56. So the quotient is 177, remainder 2. So looking at the options, I don't see 177 rem 2 as an option. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 168 rem 2

B: 178 rem 2

C: 169 rem 3

D: 178 rem 0

E: 177 rem 8

F: 178 rem 3

G: 177 rem 7

H: 178 rem 4

I: 177 rem 9

J: 178 rem 1

Hmm, none of them have 177 rem 2. Wait, did I make a mistake in the division? Let me try another approach. Maybe using multiplication to see what 7 times 177 is. 7*177. Let me calculate that: 7 times 170 is 1,190, and 7 times 7 is 49. So 1,190 +49= 1,239. Then 1,248 minus 1,239 is 9. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I had a remainder of 2. Hmm, I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe I did the subtraction wrong. Let me redo the division.

7 into 12 is 1, 1*7=7. 12-7=5.

Bring down 4: 54.

7 into 54 is 7 times (7*7=49). 54-49=5.

Bring down 8: 58.

7 into 58 is 8 times (7*8=56). 58-56=2.

So the quotient is 177, remainder 2.

Wait, but 177*7=1,239. Adding the remainder 2 gives 1,241. But the dividend is 1,248. So 1,239 +2=1,241, but 1,248-1,241=7. That doesn't make sense. I must have made an error in the multiplication.

Wait, maybe I should compute 7*177 again. Let's do it step by step.

177*7:

7*7 is 49. Write down 9, carryover 4.

7*7 is 49 plus carryover 4 is 53. Write down 3, carryover 5.

7*1 is 7 plus 5 is 12. So the product is 1,239. So 1,239 plus 2 is 1,241, which is less than 1,248. So 1,248 minus 1,239 is 9, but I thought the remainder was 2. That doesn't add up. I'm confused.

Wait a second, maybe I messed up the division steps. Let me try again.

Dividend is 1,248. Divisor is 7.

How many times does 7 go into 1 (first digit)? 0 times, so we take 12.

7 into 12 is 1 time. 1*7=7. Subtract from 12, remainder 5.

Bring down 4, making 54.

7 into 54 is 7 times, as 7*7=49. Subtract 49 from 54, remainder 5.

Bring down 8, making 58.

7 into 58 is 8 times because 7*8=56. Subtract 56 from 58, remainder 2.

So the quotient is 177, remainder 2. But when I compute 177*7 +2, I get 1,239 +2 =1,241, which is 7 less than 1,248. So that's not right. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, wait, perhaps I miscounted the quotient digits. Let me check that. Oh wait, in the division process, when I bring down the 8 after 54, it's 58. 7*8=56. So I write down 8 in the quotient, making it 177 (1, then 7, then 8). So the quotient is 177, remainder 2. But 177*7=1,239. 1,239 +2=1,241. But 1,248-1,241=7. So that can't be right. So my division must have an error.

Wait another approach: let me compute 1,248 ÷7 using another method. Maybe I can subtract 7 repeatedly, but that would take too long. Alternatively, I can use approximate multiplication.

I know that 7*170=1,190. Then, 1,248-1,190=58. Now, how many times does 7 go into 58? 8 times, because 7*8=56. So that's 170 +8 =178, and the remainder is 58-56=2. Wait, so that would make the quotient 178 and remainder 2. But earlier division suggested 177 rem 2. Now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial division steps. Let me try the division again.

7 into 12 is 1, remainder 5. Bring down 4, making 54.

7 into 54 is 7 (7*7=49), remainder 5. Bring down 8, making 58.

7 into 58 is 8 times (7*8=56), remainder 2.

So the quotient is 1 (hundreds place), 7 (tens place), 8 (ones place) → 178? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the first digit after division is 1 (from 12), then 7 (from 54), then 8 (from 58). So the quotient is 178, and the remainder is 2. Oh wait! I think I made a mistake earlier in how I was constructing the quotient. So the quotient is 178, not 177.

Wait, let me clarify. When I divided 12 by 7, I got 1, so the first digit of the quotient is 1. Then, after bringing down the 4, 54 ÷7 is 7, so the next digit is 7. Then, bringing down the 8, 58 ÷7 is 8, so the last digit is 8. So the quotient is 178, and the remainder is 2.

Wait, but when I multiplied 178 *7 earlier, I thought it was 1,246, which would make the remainder 2, because 1,248 -1,246=2. Wait, let me calculate 178*7 correctly.

178*7: 100*7=700, 70*7=490, 8*7=56. So 700+490=1,190 +56=1,246. So 1,246 +2=1,248. Yes, that adds up correctly. So the quotient is 178, remainder 2.

So looking back at the options, option B is 178 rem 2. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought the quotient was 177. I must have miscounted the digits when I did the long division the first time. It's easy to get confused with the digits, but checking via multiplication clarifies it.
</think>

To determine the quotient of 1,248 ÷ 7, we perform long division:

1. Divide 12 by 7: 7 goes into 12 once (1), with a remainder of 5.
2. Bring down the next digit (4), making it 54. 7 goes into 54 seven times (7), with a remainder of 5.
3. Bring down the next digit (8), making it 58. 7 goes into 58 eight times (8), with a remainder of 2.

Thus, the quotient is 178, and the remainder is 2. Verifying this, \(178 \times 7 = 1,246\), and \(1,248 - 1,246 = 2\), confirming the remainder is correct.

From the given options:

- **A: 168 rem 2** → Incorrect (quotient is too low).
- **B: 178 rem 2** → Correct (matches the calculated quotient and remainder).
- **C: 169 rem 3** → Incorrect (quotient and remainder are wrong).
- **D: 178 rem 0** → Incorrect (remainder is not 0).
- **E: 177 rem 8** → Incorrect (quotient and remainder are wrong).
- **F: 178 rem 3** → Incorrect (remainder is wrong).
- **G: 177 rem 7** → Incorrect (quotient and remainder are wrong).
- **H: 178 rem 4** → Incorrect (remainder is wrong).
- **I: 177 rem 9** → Incorrect (quotient and remainder are wrong).
- **J: 178 rem 1** → Incorrect (remainder is wrong).

The correct answer is **B: 178 remainder 2**.

B
