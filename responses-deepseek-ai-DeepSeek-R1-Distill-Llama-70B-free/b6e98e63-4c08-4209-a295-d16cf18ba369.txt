Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. It looks like it's about chemical reactions and their rate constants. Hmm. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question says that there are three competing reactions involving NH2 and different forms of N. The reactions are:

1. NH2 + N^a → H2 + N2
2. NH2 + N^b → 2NH
3. NH2 + N^c → N2H + H

They give the ratio of the rate constants ka, kb, kc as 0.57 : 0.24 : 0.19. And the question is about determining the products' ratio at time t.

Wait, so the products are H2 + N2 from the first reaction, 2NH from the second, and N2H + H from the third. So for each reaction, the product is a specific set of molecules.

I think the key here is that each reaction has a different rate constant, and the product ratio depends on these rate constants. Since the reactions are competing, the relative rates will determine how much each product is formed.

But wait, how exactly do the rate constants influence the product ratios? Oh right, higher rate constants mean the reaction proceeds faster, producing more products from that pathway.

So each reaction contributes to the total products based on their rate constants. Let me think about this. The rate of each reaction is proportional to the rate constant times the concentrations of the reactants. Assuming that the concentrations are the same initially (since it's about the ratio), the product distribution should depend on the relative values of the rate constants.

Wait, but the question gives the ratio of ka, kb, kc as 0.57 : 0.24 : 0.19. So ka is the largest, followed by kb, then kc. So the first reaction has the highest rate, then the second, then the third.

So the products from the first reaction would be the most, followed by the second, then the third. But wait, each reaction produces different products. So the products' ratio would be determined by the rate constants.

Wait, but the products are different. Let me see:

First reaction: produces H2 and N2.

Second: produces NH (but 2 moles?), but the product is 2NH.

Third: produces N2H and H.

Wait, but in terms of the products, each reaction produces two products except the second, which produces 2NH. Hmm, but when considering the ratio, perhaps it's about the amount of each product relative to others.

Wait, but the question is about the products' ratio at time t. So maybe it's the ratio of [H2 + N2] : [2NH] : [N2H + H].

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction contributes a certain amount, and the total product ratio is determined by the rate constants.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Since the reactions are in competition, the rate of each reaction is proportional to their rate constant. Assuming that all start with the same concentrations of NH2 and the respective N^k, then the amount of each product formed is proportional to the rate constants.

Wait, but each reaction involves NH2 and a different N species. So the rate of each reaction is proportional to [NH2][N^a], [NH2][N^b], [NH2][N^c], each multiplied by ka, kb, kc respectively.

But if the concentrations of N^a, N^b, N^c are the same, then the rates are proportional to ka, kb, kc. So the initial rates are determined by these constants.

But over time, the concentrations would change, but assuming that the reactions are starting fresh and we're looking for the product distribution at a certain time t, perhaps under the assumption that all the reactions are first-order and the initial concentrations are the same, the ratio of the products would be directly proportional to the ratio of the rate constants.

Wait, that might not be correct if the stoichiometry varies. For example, the first reaction produces two molecules (H2 and N2), but the third reaction also produces two (N2H and H). The second reaction produces two NH molecules.

Wait, but when you have products, the amount formed depends on the stoichiometry and the rate. So for each reaction, the amount of product formed would be based on how much reactant is consumed. Since all reactions start with the same amount of NH2 and N^k, but different rate constants, the product amounts would be in proportion to the rate constants.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio of the products is simply the same as the ratio of the rate constants. But looking at the options, option C is (0.57 / 0.24 / 0.19), which is exactly the same as the given rate constants.

But wait, the problem states that the ka, kb, kc are in the ratio 0.57 : 0.24 : 0.19. So the order is ka > kb > kc. So the products from the first reaction would be the most, then the second, then the third.

Looking at the options, option C is (0.57, 0.24, 0.19), which is the same as the rate constants. So that would imply that the product ratio is the same as the rate constants ratio.

But wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Because each product is from a different reaction, perhaps the ratio is the same as the rate constants. So the main product comes from the first reaction, then the second, then the third.

So the product ratio would be in the order of first product : second product : third product, each proportional to their rate constants.

So the correct ratio should be (0.57 : 0.24 : 0.19), which is option C.

Looking at the options, option C is (0.57 / 0.24 / 0.19), which matches our conclusion. So the answer should be option C.

The problem involves three competing reactions:

1. **NH₂ + Nᵃ → H₂ + N₂**  
2. **NH₂ + Nᴮ → 2NH**  
3. **NH₂ + Nᶜ → N₂H + H**

The rate constants for these reactions are given in the ratio **kₐ : kᴮ : kᶜ = 0.57 : 0.24 : 0.19**. The task is to determine the ratio of the products at time \( t \).

Since the reactions are competing, the relative rates of the reactions are proportional to their rate constants, assuming the initial concentrations of the reactants are the same. This means the amount of each product formed is directly proportional to the corresponding rate constant. Therefore, the ratio of the products will match the ratio of the rate constants.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A: (0.19 / 0.57 / 0.24)** — Does not match the given ratio of rate constants.  
- **Option B: (0.57 / 0.48 / 0.19)** — Introduces a value (0.48) not present in the given ratio.  
- **Option C: (0.57 / 0.24 / 0.19)** — Matches the given ratio of rate constants exactly.  
- **Option D: (0.48 / 0.57 / 0.19)** — Incorrect, as it includes 0.48, which is not part of the given ratio.  
- **Option E: (0.19 / 0.24 / 0.57)** — Reverses the order of the given ratio.  
- **Option F: (0.57 / 0.24 / 0.48)** — Includes 0.48, which is not part of the given ratio.  
- **Option G: (0.19 / 0.48 / 0.57)** — Includes 0.48 and reverses the order.  
- **Option H: (0.48 / 0.19 / 0.57)** — Includes 0.48 and does not match the given ratio.  
- **Option I: (0.24 / 0.19 / 0.57)** — Partially matches but reverses the order of some constants.  
- **Option J: (0.24 / 0.57 / 0.19)** — Partially matches but reverses the order of some constants.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it directly corresponds to the given ratio of rate constants, which determines the product ratio.

**Answer: C**
