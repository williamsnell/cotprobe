Okay, I'm trying to figure out this economics question about the federal deficit and its effects on loanable funds, real interest rates, and investment spending. Hmm, I remember that when the federal government runs a deficit, it borrows money to cover its spending. So, how does that affect the loanable funds market?

I think the loanable funds market is where borrowers (like the government) meet lenders. If the government is borrowing more, that would increase the demand for loanable funds. Because the government needs more funds to finance its deficit, it's going to borrow more from the market. So the demand curve for loanable funds shifts to the right.

When demand increases in the loanable funds market, the equilibrium interest rate should go up. Because more borrowers are competing for the available funds, the price of borrowing, which is the interest rate, increases. So the real interest rate rises.

Now, what about investment spending? Investment is done by businesses, and it's influenced by the interest rate. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for firms. So when the real interest rate goes up, businesses are less likely to invest because the cost of capital increases. Therefore, investment spending should decrease.

Putting it all together: the demand for loanable funds increases, real interest rate increases, and investment spending decreases. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options:

Option H: Increases, Increases, Decreases. That's exactly what I thought. So the correct answer should be H.

The federal deficit increases the government's borrowing, which raises the demand for loanable funds. This shifts the demand curve rightward, leading to a higher real interest rate. With the cost of borrowing rising, businesses reduce their investment spending. 

The correct sequence is:
- **Demand for loanable funds**: Increases
- **Real interest rate**: Increases
- **Investment spending**: Decreases

Option H matches this analysis.

Answer: H
