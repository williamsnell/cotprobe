Okay, I'm trying to figure out this matrix multiplication problem. So the question is about the time it takes to compute the product of three matrices, N1N2N3, under two different orders: (N1N2)N3 versus N1(N2N3). I need to determine under what condition the first approach is faster than the second.

I remember that matrix multiplication is associative, so both orders will give the same result, but the time taken can differ because the number of scalar multiplications depends on the order. The time is proportional to the product of the dimensions involved in each multiplication step.

Let me break it down. Let's denote the matrices:

- N1 has w rows and x columns (w × x)
- N2 has x rows and y columns (x × y)
- N3 has y rows and z columns (y × z)

First, compute (N1N2)N3:

1. Multiply N1 and N2. N1 is w×x, N2 is x×y. The product N1N2 will be w×y. The number of operations is w * x * y (since it's p*q*r where p=w, q=x, r=y).
2. Then multiply this result (w×y) with N3 (y×z). The result will be w×z. The number of operations here is w * y * z.

So the total operations for (N1N2)N3 would be (w*x*y) + (w*y*z).

Wait, no, wait. No, that's not right. Wait, when multiplying two matrices, the number of scalar multiplications is the product of the number of rows of the first, the number of columns of the second, and the number of columns of the first (which equals the rows of the second). So N1 is w x x, N2 is x x y. So N1*N2 is (w x y) matrix, and takes w*x*y operations. Then that multiplied by N3 (y x z) would take (w y) * y * z? No wait, no, when you multiply (w x y) and (y x z), the number of operations is w * y * z (since the first has y columns, the second y rows, and the resulting rows are w, columns z. So each element is a dot product of w elements, each requiring y multiplications and additions. So for each of the w*z elements, it's y operations. So total is w*y*z.

Wait, no, wait another moment. Let me think again. When you multiply two matrices A (a x b) and B (b x c), the resulting matrix is a x c. Each element in the resulting matrix requires b multiplications and additions. So the total number of operations is a * c * b. So for N1*N2: a=w, b=x, c=y. So operations are w * x * y. Then, (N1N2) is w x y. Then multiplying by N3 (y x z): a=w, b=y, c=z. So operations are w * y * z. So total operations for (N1N2)N3 is (w x y) + (w y z) ? No, wait, no, wait. No, the total is the sum of the two steps. So it's (w x y) + (w y z).

Wait, no, wait a minute. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the first step is N1*N2, which is w x y, taking w*x*y operations. Then, the second step is (w x y) multiplied by (y x z), which would take w * y * z operations. So the total is w*x*y + w*y*z = w y (x + z).

Wait, but wait, wait. No, that can't be right. Because when you multiply a matrix of size a x b with b x c, the operations are a * b * c for each step. So the first step is (w x x) multiplied by (x x y) → w x y, cost w*x*y. Then (w x y) multiplied by (y x z) → w x z, cost w*y*z. So the total cost is wxy + wyz.

Alternatively, if I compute N1*(N2*N3), let's see the steps.

1. N2 is x x y, N3 is y x z. Multiplying these gives N2N3, which is x x z. The cost is x * y * z.
2. Then, N1 is w x x, multiplied by (x x z) → w x z. The cost is w * x * z.

So the total cost for N1*(N2N3) is (x y z) + (w x z).

Wait, no, wait a minute again. Let me recheck:

Option 1: (N1 N2) N3:

Cost of N1*N2: w * x * y

Cost of (N1N2)*N3: (w rows) * (y columns) * (z columns) → w * y * z.

Total cost: w x y + w y z = w y (x + z).

Option 2: N1 (N2 N3):

Cost of N2*N3: x * y * z.

Cost of N1*(N2N3): w * x * z.

Total cost: x y z + w x z = x z (y + w).

So the question is under what condition is the first option (N1N2)N3 faster than the second option N1(N2N3). So we need:

w y (x + z) < x z (w + y)

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. Wait, the total time for (N1N2)N3 is (w x y) + (w y z) = w y (x + z). For N1(N2N3), it's (x y z) + (w x z) = x z (y + w).

We need to find when (w y (x + z)) < (x z (w + y)).

So:

w y (x + z) < x z (w + y)

Let me write this inequality:

w y (x + z) < x z (w + y)

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this differently or find a condition.

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: w y x + w y z

Right side: x z w + x z y

So:

w x y + w y z < w x z + x y z

Let me bring all terms to one side.

w x y + w y z - w x z - x y z < 0

Factor terms:

w x y - w x z = w x (y - z)

w y z - x y z = y z (w - x)

So overall:

w x (y - z) + y z (w - x) < 0

Hmm, not sure that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor differently.

Wait, let's try to factor the inequality.

w y (x + z) < x z (w + y)

Dividing both sides by x y z w (assuming none are zero), but perhaps that's messy.

Alternatively, perhaps rewrite the inequality.

Let's take the original inequality:

w y (x + z) < x z (w + y)

Let me divide both sides by x y z w to see if I can simplify.

Wait, but that's assuming x, y, z, w are non-zero, which they are as matrix dimensions.

Divide both sides by x y z w:

(w y (x + z)) / (x y z w) < (x z (w + y)) / (x y z w)

Simplify:

(y (x + z)) / (x z) < z (w + y) / (y w)

Wait, perhaps it's getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to rearrange the inequality.

Let me write it as:

w y (x + z) < x z (w + y)

Let me move all terms to left:

w y (x + z) - x z (w + y) < 0

Expand:

w y x + w y z - x z w - x z y < 0

Factor:

w x y - x w z + w y z - x y z = wx(y - z) + y z (w - x)

Hmm, perhaps factor differently.

Wait, another approach: Let me think of the inequality as:

w y (x + z) < x z (w + y)

Which can be written as:

w y x + w y z < x z w + x y z

Subtract x z w from both sides and subtract w y z from both sides:

w y x - x z w + w y z - x y z < x y z - x y z ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me try to factor.

Wait, another approach: Let me factor terms with w and terms without.

Wait, let me bring all terms to one side:

w y (x + z) - x z (w + y) < 0

Let me distribute:

w y x + w y z - x z w - x z y < 0

Now, group terms:

w y x - x z w = w x (y - z)

w y z - x y z = y z (w - x)

So the left side becomes w x (y - z) + y z (w - x) < 0.

Hmm, perhaps factor (y - z) and (w - x):

Not sure, but maybe this can be written as (y - z)(w x) + (w - x)(y z) <0.

Alternatively, factor out (y - z) and (w - x):

But not seeing a clear way. Let me think of the terms:

We can factor:

(w x)(y - z) + (y z)(w - x) < 0

Perhaps factor (w - x) and (y - z):

Wait, (w x)(y - z) = x w (y - z)

(y z)(w - x) = y z (w - x) = - y z (x - w)

So,

x w (y - z) - y z (x - w) < 0

Hmm, factor (x - w) ?

Not sure. Alternatively, let's consider that the condition is when (w y (x + z)) < (x z (w + y)), which can be rewritten as:

w y (x + z) < x z (w + y)

Divide both sides by x y z w to simplify:

( (x + z) ) / (x z) < ( (w + y) ) / (w y )

Wait, that's an interesting approach. Let me try that.

Divide both side by (x y z w):

[ w y (x + z) ] / (x y z w) < [ x z (w + y) ] / (x y z w )

Simplify each term:

Left side: [w y (x + z)] / (x y z w) ) → (x + z) / (x z )

Right side: [x z (w + y)] / (x y z w) ) → (w + y) / (y w )

So the inequality becomes:

(x + z)/(x z) < (w + y)/(w y )

Let me write that as:

(x + z)/(x z) < (w + y)/(w y )

Simplify each fraction:

Left side: (x + z)/(x z) = (1/z) + (1/x)

Right side: (w + y)/(w y) = (1/y) + (1/w)

So the inequality is:

(1/x + 1/z) < (1/w + 1/y )

Hmm, that's a key point. So for (N1N2)N3 to be faster than N1(N2N3), we need:

1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y

Wait, but wait. Wait, the original condition is that (N1N2)N3 is faster, which requires that w y (x + z) < x z (w + y). Which simplifies to 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y.

So the correct condition is 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y.

Looking at the options, I need to find the option that matches this condition.

Looking at the options provided:

Option D: 1/x + 1/z < 1/w + 1/y → This matches.

Option E: 1/w + 1/z > 1/x + 1/y → Not matching.

Option I: 1/x + 1/y > 1/w + 1/z → Opposite of what we need.

Wait, the condition I found is 1/x +1/z < 1/w +1/y. So looking at the options:

Option D says 1/x +1/z < 1/w +1/y → which is exactly our condition. So option D is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. The initial condition was that (N1N2)N3 is faster when (w y (x+z)) < (x z (w + y)). We reduced that to 1/x + 1/z < 1/w +1/y. So yes, the correct option is D.

To determine under what condition computing the product of three matrices as \((N_1N_2)N_3\) is faster than \(N_1(N_2N_3)\), we analyze the computational costs of both approaches.

### Matrix Dimensions:
- \(N_1\): \(w \times x\)
- \(N_2\): \(x \times y\)
- \(N_3\): \(y \times z\)

### Computational Costs:
1. **For \((N_1N_2)N_3\):**
   - First, compute \(N_1N_2\): The result is \(w \times y\), and the cost is proportional to \(w \cdot x \cdot y\).
   - Then, compute \((N_1N_2)N_3\): The result is \(w \times z\), and the cost is proportional to \(w \cdot y \cdot z\).
   - Total cost: \(w \cdot x \cdot y + w \cdot y \cdot z = w \cdot y \cdot (x + z)\).

2. **For \(N_1(N_2N_3)\):**
   - First, compute \(N_2N_3\): The result is \(x \times z\), and the cost is proportional to \(x \cdot y \cdot z\).
   - Then, compute \(N_1(N_2N_3)\): The result is \(w \times z\), and the cost is proportional to \(w \cdot x \cdot z\).
   - Total cost: \(x \cdot y \cdot z + w \cdot x \cdot z = x \cdot z \cdot (y + w)\).

### Condition for \((N_1N_2)N_3\) to be Faster:
We need the total cost of \((N_1N_2)N_3\) to be less than that of \(N_1(N_2N_3)\):
\[
w \cdot y \cdot (x + z) < x \cdot z \cdot (w + y).
\]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[
w \cdot y \cdot x + w \cdot y \cdot z < w \cdot x \cdot z + x \cdot y \cdot z.
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
w \cdot x \cdot y - w \cdot x \cdot z + w \cdot y \cdot z - x \cdot y \cdot z < 0.
\]

Factoring:
\[
w \cdot x \cdot (y - z) + y \cdot z \cdot (w - x) < 0.
\]

Dividing through by \(x \cdot y \cdot z \cdot w\) (assuming all are nonzero):
\[
\frac{x + z}{x \cdot z} < \frac{w + y}{w \cdot y}.
\]

Simplifying further:
\[
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{z} < \frac{1}{w} + \frac{1}{y}.
\]

### Correct Option:
The condition for \((N_1N_2)N_3\) to be faster is:
\[
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{z} < \frac{1}{w} + \frac{1}{y}.
\]

This matches **Option D**.
