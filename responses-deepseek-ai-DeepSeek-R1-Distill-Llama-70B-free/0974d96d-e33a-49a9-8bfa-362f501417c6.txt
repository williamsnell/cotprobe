Okay, so I've got this problem here about the lunar surface atmosphere, and I need to find the volume for two different scenarios: when there's 10^6 molecules and when there's 1 millimole of gas. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my gas laws, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the given data: barometric pressure is 10^-10 torr, and the temperature is 100 K. Right, so I remember the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. But wait, I need to make sure all the units are compatible.

First, let me jot down what I know. Pressure P is 1e-10 torr. I think 1 torr is about 1 mmHg, which is 133.322 pascals. So converting that, 1e-10 torr equals 1e-10 * 133.322 Pa. Let me calculate that: 1e-10 * 133.322 is 1.33322e-8 Pa. Wait, but sometimes in gas law problems, using atmospheres might be easier since R is often in L·atm/(mol·K). Let me see: 1 atm is 760 torr, so 1 torr is 1/760 atm. So 1e-10 torr is (1e-10) / 760 atm. Let me compute that: 1e-10 / 760 ≈ 1.3158e-13 atm. Hmm, that's really small.

Next, the temperature T is 100 K. Okay, that's straightforward.

The gas constant R is usually 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), right? So I'll use that.

Now, part (a) is for 1e6 molecules. I remember that one mole has Avogadro's number of molecules, which is about 6.022e23. So n, the number of moles, would be 1e6 / 6.022e23. Let me compute that: approximately 1.66e-18 mol.

So plugging into PV = nRT. I need to solve for V. So V = nRT / P.

Wait, let me make sure I have all the units right. n is in mol, R is L·atm/(mol·K), T in K, P in atm. So the units should work out to liters.

So for part (a), n = 1.66e-18 mol, R = 0.0821, T = 100 K, P = 1.3158e-13 atm.

Calculating V: (1.66e-18) * 0.0821 * 100 / (1.3158e-13).

Let me compute numerator first: 1.66e-18 * 0.0821 = approx 1.36e-19. Multiply by 100 gives 1.36e-17.

Divide by 1.3158e-13: 1.36e-17 / 1.3158e-13 ≈ 1.033e-4 liters. So about 1.03e-4 L. Let me check my calculations again because I might have messed up exponents.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let me write the numbers:

n = 1e6 / 6.022e23 = approximately 1.6605e-18 mol.

R*T = 0.0821 * 100 = 8.21.

So numerator is n*R*T = 1.6605e-18 * 8.21 ≈ 1.3605e-17.

P is 1.3158e-13 atm.

So V = 1.3605e-17 / 1.3158e-13 = (1.3605 / 1.3158) * 1e-4. 1.3605 / 1.3158 ≈ 1.034. So V ≈ 1.034e-4 L, which is 1.034 x 10^-4 liters. Hmm, looking at the options, E has 1.04e-4 for part (a), which matches. Wait, but let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: option E (a) is 1.04e-4 L, yes. So that's part (a).

Now part (b) is 1 millimole of gas. A millimole is 1e-3 mol. So n = 1e-3 mol.

Again, using PV = nRT. V = nRT / P.

n = 1e-3 mol.

So V = (1e-3) * 0.0821 * 100 / 1.3158e-13.

Compute numerator: 1e-3 * 0.0821 * 100 = 8.21e-3.

Wait, wait, no. Let me recheck: 1e-3 * (0.0821 * 100) = 1e-3 * 8.21 = 0.00821.

Wait no, that's not right. Oh wait, 0.0821 * 100 is 8.21, so 1e-3 * 8.21 is 0.00821. Then divide by P (1.3158e-13 atm).

So V = 0.00821 / 1.3158e-13 = approximately 6.24e10 liters. Because 0.00821 is 8.21e-3, so 8.21e-3 / 1.3158e-13 = (8.21 / 1.3158) * 1e10. 8.21 / 1.3158 is roughly 6.24. So 6.24e10 liters.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. 8.21e-3 divided by 1.3158e-13 equals (8.21 / 1.3158) * 1e10. 8.21 / 1.3158: Let's see, 1.3158 * 6 = 7.8948. So 8.21 -7.8948 = 0.3152. 0.3152 / 1.3158 ≈ 0.24. So total is about 6.24, so 6.24e10 liters.

Looking at the options, part (b) for E is 6.24e10 L. So option E has both parts matching. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check. Wait, the pressure was converted correctly. Oh, wait, when I calculated pressure, I did 1e-10 torr converted to atm. Alternative approach: I could also compute in Pascals and use R as 8.314 J/(mol·K), but that might complicate things.

Wait, let me try the alternative approach for part (a) just to confirm.

Pressure in Pa: 1e-10 torr * 133.322 Pa/torr = 1.33322e-8 Pa.

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 (m^3·Pa)/(mol·K).

n is 1e6 / 6.022e23 = 1.66e-18 mol.

T is 100 K.

V = nRT/P.

Plugging in the numbers: (1.66e-18 mol) * (8.314 m^3·Pa/mol·K) * (100 K) / (1.33322e-8 Pa).

Compute numerator: 1.66e-18 * 8.314 * 100 = 1.66e-18 * 831.4 ≈ 1.38e-15.

Divide by 1.33322e-8: 1.38e-15 / 1.33322e-8 = approx 1.035e-7 m^3. Wait, 1 m^3 is 1000 liters, so 1.035e-7 m^3 is 103.5 liters. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I got 1e-4 liters. Oh wait, no, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate. Maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, 1.66e-18 * 8.314 = approx 1.382e-17. Then multiply by 100 gives 1.382e-15.

Divide by 1.333e-8: 1.382e-15 / 1.333e-8 = (1.382 / 1.333) * 1e-7 = approx 1.037 * 1e-7 = 1.037e-7 m^3.

Convert m^3 to liters: 1 m^3 = 1000 L, so 1.037e-7 m³ = 103.7 liters. Wait, that's way bigger than the earlier 1e-4 liters. So that's a problem. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, why the two different results? Oh, I think I messed up the units in the second approach. Let me check again.

Wait, in the second method, I used P in Pa, R in m^3·Pa/(mol·K), so that's correct. The calculation gives V in m^3, which I then convert to liters. But the result is 1.037e-7 m³, which is 103.7 liters. But the first method gave me 1.03e-4 liters, which is about a thousandth of a liter. That's a big difference. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the pressure conversion. Let me double-check. 1 torr is 133.322368 pascals. So 1e-10 torr is 1e-10 * 133.322368 = 1.33322368e-8 Pa. That's correct.

In the first method, using atm:

1e-10 torr is 1e-10 /760 atm ≈ 1.3158e-13 atm. Correct.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K. So calculations in the first method are correct. But the second method is giving a different result, which can't be.

Wait, no, wait a minute. Let me redo the second method's calculation.

n = 1.66e-18 mol.

R=8.314 J/(mol·K) = 8.314 m³·Pa/(mol·K).

T=100 K.

P=1.33322e-8 Pa.

So V = (n R T) / P.

n R T = 1.66e-18 * 8.314 * 100.

Compute that: 1.66e-18 * 8.314 = approx 1.382e-17. Multiply by 100: 1.382e-15.

Divide by P: 1.33322e-8.

So 1.382e-15 / 1.33322e-8 = (1.382 / 1.33322) * 1e-7.

1.382 / 1.33322 ≈ 1.037, so 1.037e-7 m³.

1 m³ is 1e3 liters, so 1.037e-7 m³ = 1.037e-4 liters, which matches the first method's result! Oh, I see, I must have made a calculation error earlier. So 1.037e-7 m³ equals 0.0001037 m³, which is 103.7 liters. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, no: 1 m³ is 10^3 liters. So 1.037e-7 m³ = 1.037e-4 liters (because 1e-3 m³ is 1 liter, so 1e-7 m³ is 1e-4 liters). Oh! So I think I confused the exponent.

So 1.037e-7 m³ is 1.037e-4 liters, which is 0.0001037 liters, which is 1.037 x 10^-4 L. That matches the first method. So both methods give the same result. So part (a) is 1.04e-4 L, which is option E.

Then part (b), using the first method: n=1e-3 mol.

V = nRT/P.

n=1e-3, R=0.0821, T=100, P=1.3158e-13 atm.

Compute numerator: 1e-3 * 0.0821 * 100 = 1e-3 * 8.21 = 0.00821.

Divide by P: 0.00821 / 1.3158e-13.

0.00821 is 8.21e-3.

So 8.21e-3 / 1.3158e-13 = (8.21 / 1.3158) * 1e10 ≈ 6.24 * 1e10 = 6.24e10 liters.

Which again matches option E's part (b). So the correct answer is E.

To solve the problem, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = nRT \quad \text{or} \quad V = \frac{nRT}{P}
\]

### Given Data:
- Pressure, \( P = 10^{-10} \, \text{torr} = \frac{10^{-10}}{760} \, \text{atm} \approx 1.3158 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{atm} \)
- Temperature, \( T = 100 \, \text{K} \)
- Gas constant, \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)

### Part (a): Volume for \( 10^6 \) molecules
1. Convert \( 10^6 \) molecules to moles:
   \[
   n = \frac{10^6}{6.022 \times 10^{23}} \approx 1.66 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{mol}
   \]
2. Calculate volume:
   \[
   V = \frac{nRT}{P} = \frac{(1.66 \times 10^{-18})(0.0821)(100)}{1.3158 \times 10^{-13}}
   \]
   - Numerator: \( (1.66 \times 10^{-18})(0.0821)(100) = 1.36 \times 10^{-17} \)
   - Divide by \( P \): \( \frac{1.36 \times 10^{-17}}{1.3158 \times 10^{-13}} \approx 1.03 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{L} \)

Thus, the volume for part (a) is approximately \( 1.04 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{L} \).

### Part (b): Volume for 1 millimole of gas
1. Convert 1 millimole to moles:
   \[
   n = 1 \, \text{millimole} = 1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mol}
   \]
2. Calculate volume:
   \[
   V = \frac{nRT}{P} = \frac{(1 \times 10^{-3})(0.0821)(100)}{1.3158 \times 10^{-13}}
   \]
   - Numerator: \( (1 \times 10^{-3})(0.0821)(100) = 0.00821 \)
   - Divide by \( P \): \( \frac{0.00821}{1.3158 \times 10^{-13}} \approx 6.24 \times 10^{10} \, \text{L} \)

Thus, the volume for part (b) is approximately \( 6.24 \times 10^{10} \, \text{L} \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **E: \( 1.04 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{L} \) and \( 6.24 \times 10^{10} \, \text{L} \)**.
