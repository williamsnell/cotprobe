Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about treaties and their form. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on international law, but I'll try to think through it.

The question is asking whether treaties should assume a particular form. The options are A through J, each presenting different conditions about designation and form. I remember that treaties are formal agreements between states, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics regarding their form.

Wait, I think the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) has something to say about this. From what I recall, the VCLT is a key treaty that sets out the rules for treaties between states. Article 2 of the VCLT defines a treaty as an agreement between states (or international organizations) that is governed by international law. It also mentions that treaties can be designated by various names like treaty, convention, agreement, etc., but the form isn't strictly specified.

So, the form of a treaty isn't fixed. They can be written in different ways, as long as they meet the basic criteria. But I'm a bit confused about whether they have to be designated as treaties. I think the designation isn't mandatory in terms of naming, but the substance of the agreement is what matters. Like, even if it's called an agreement or a protocol, it's still a treaty under international law as long as it's between states and intended to create legal obligations.

Looking at the options:

Option A says treaties don't need to be designated as such but must assume a particular form. Wait, no, because I thought the form isn't required. So A might be incorrect.

Option B says treaties must be written in legal language regardless of form. That doesn't sound right. The language can vary, and form isn't fixed. So B is probably wrong.

Option C says treaties should always assume a particular form, regardless of designation. No, because the VCLT says form isn't necessary. So C is out.

Option D states treaties must be designated as such but don't need a particular form. Wait, designation as a treaty isn't mandatory because they can be called other names. So D is incorrect.

Option E says treaties don't need to assume a particular form or be designated as such. That aligns with what I remember. The treaty can take any form and any name, as long as it's an agreement between states with the intent to create legal obligations.

Option F says they shouldn't be designated and don't need a form. But I think designation isn't necessary, but the option says "should not be designated," which is different. I don't think there's a prohibition on designation, just that it's not required.

Option G talks about ratification by the legislative body. Ratification is a process, but the question is about form and designation. So G is about procedure, not form, so it's not the right answer.

Option H says they must be designated as such, regardless of form. But designation isn't required, so H is wrong.

Option I says they should be designated and assume a form. That's not correct because neither is necessary.

Option J mentions signing by heads of state. That's about authentication, not form or designation. So J isn't the answer.

Wait, but I thought the key point is that treaties don't have to be in a specific form or designated as such. So the correct answer would be E. But let me double-check.

The VCLT in Article 2(1)(a) defines a treaty without requiring a specific form or designation. The focus is on the agreement's content and the intention to be bound. So yes, treaties don't have to assume a particular form or be designated as treaties.

So the correct answer should be E.

The question revolves around whether treaties must assume a particular form or designation. Based on the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), treaties are defined by their content and the intention to create legal obligations between states, not by their form or designation. The VCLT explicitly states that treaties can take various forms (e.g., agreements, conventions, protocols) and do not need to be specifically designated as "treaties." This means that neither the form nor the designation is mandatory for an agreement to qualify as a treaty under international law.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C, D, H, I**: These options suggest that treaties must assume a particular form or designation, which contradicts the VCLT's flexibility regarding form and designation.
- **B, J**: These focus on legal language or ratification/signing processes, which are not relevant to the question of form or designation.
- **E**: Correctly reflects the VCLT's position that treaties do not need to assume a particular form or be designated as such.
- **F, G**: While partially correct, they introduce unnecessary restrictions or procedural requirements not relevant to the question.

Thus, the correct answer is **E**, as it aligns with the VCLT's definition of treaties, emphasizing that neither form nor designation is required.

Answer: E
