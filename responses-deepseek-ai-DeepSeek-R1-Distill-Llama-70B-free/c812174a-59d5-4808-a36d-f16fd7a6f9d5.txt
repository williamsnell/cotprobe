Question:

A 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of malaise, muscle and joint pain, and temperatures to 38.4°C (101.1°F) for 3 days. Three months ago, he underwent cadaveric renal transplantation resulting in immediate kidney function. At the time of discharge, his serum creatinine concentration was 0.8 mg/dL. He is receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Examination shows no abnormalities. His leukocyte count is 2700/mm3 , and serum creatinine concentration is 1.6 mg/dL; serum cyclosporine concentration is in the therapeutic range. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Increase the dosage of corticosteroids
B: Begin amphotericin therapy
C: Increase the dosage of cyclosporine
D: Perform a second kidney transplant
E: Discontinue all medications and monitor the patient's condition
F: Begin ganciclovir therapy
G: Begin interferon therapy
H: Decrease the dosage of cyclosporine
I: Decrease the dosage of corticosteroids
J: Begin acyclovir therapy

Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about a patient who had a kidney transplant and is now presenting with certain symptoms. I need to figure out what's going on and choose the correct management step.

So, the patient is a 42-year-old man. Three months ago, he had a cadaveric renal transplant, and his kidney function was immediate, which is a good sign. At discharge, his serum creatinine was 0.8 mg/dL, which is pretty normal. Now, he's come in with malaise, muscle and joint pain, and a fever of 38.4°C for three days. His exam is normal, but his leukocyte count is low at 2700/mm³. His serum creatinine has risen to 1.6 mg/dL, which suggests some kidney dysfunction. His cyclosporine levels are therapeutic, so that's within the expected range.

The key clue here is the kidney biopsy showing intracellular inclusion bodies. Hmm, inclusion bodies... What causes that in a transplant patient? I remember that certain infections can cause inclusion bodies. Common ones are CMV (cytomegalovirus) and maybe polyoma viruses like BK virus. Also, other viruses like herpes simplex could cause inclusion bodies, but maybe more in the skin or other areas.

Wait, in transplant patients, especially those on immunosuppression, CMV is a common issue. It can cause a range of problems, including affecting the transplanted organ. The patient is on cyclosporine and corticosteroids, which are immunosuppressive. So, his immune system is suppressed, making him susceptible to infections.

CMV infection can present with symptoms like fever, malaise, and myalgias, which fit this patient's presentation. Also, it can cause an elevation in creatinine if it's affecting the kidney, like CMV nephritis. The inclusion bodies in the biopsy would likely be due to viral infection, probably CMV.

So, the next step is to treat CMV infection. The antiviral medications for CMV typically include ganciclovir or valganciclovir. Let me look at the options. Option F is begin ganciclovir, and option J is acyclovir. I think acyclovir is more for herpes viruses, like HSV or VZV, and maybe EBV. Ganciclovir is more specific for CMV.

Wait, but what about other possibilities? Could it be another virus? The biopsy shows intracellular inclusion bodies, which are typical for viral infections. CMV is a likely culprit here, given the context.

So, the appropriate next step would be to start antiviral therapy. Ganciclovir is the drug for CMV. So, the answer should be F: Begin ganciclovir therapy.

Looking at the other options: A and I are about corticosteroids. Increasing or decreasing them might not address the infection. Cyclosporine dosage changes (C, H) could affect the immune response, but the cyclosporine levels are already therapeutic, so changing them might not be the first step. Amphotericin (B) is for fungal infections, which doesn't fit here. Interferon (G) is used in some viral infections, but not typically first-line for CMV. Discontinuing all meds (E) would be risky and not advisable. Second transplant (D) is way too premature.

The patient is a 42-year-old man who underwent cadaveric renal transplantation three months ago and is now presenting with malaise, muscle and joint pain, fever (38.4°C), leukopenia (2700/mm³), and elevated serum creatinine (1.6 mg/dL). A kidney biopsy reveals intracellular inclusion bodies, which are characteristic of viral infections. Given his immunosuppressed state due to cyclosporine and corticosteroids, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most likely diagnosis. CMV is a common cause of morbidity in transplant patients and can lead to symptoms such as fever, malaise, and organ dysfunction, including elevated creatinine if the kidney is affected.

The appropriate management for CMV infection is antiviral therapy. Among the options provided, ganciclovir (option F) is the most appropriate choice, as it is a first-line treatment for CMV. Acyclovir (option J) is less effective against CMV and is more commonly used for herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus. Other options, such as adjusting immunosuppressive medications (A, C, H, I), starting antifungal therapy (B), or discontinuing all medications (E), are not appropriate in this context. Interferon (G) is not a first-line treatment for CMV, and a second transplant (D) is premature.

The correct answer is to begin ganciclovir therapy.
