Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see, the question is about finding the pH of a household cleaning solution based on its hydronium ion concentration. Hmm, I remember that pH is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions, but wait, hydronium ions are H3O+ which are essentially H+ ions in solution, right?

So the problem says the hydronium ion concentration is 10^-11 M. I think the formula to find pH is pH = -log[H+], but since [H3O+] is the same as [H+] in this context, I can use that concentration directly.

Wait, let me make sure. Hydronium is H3O+, which comes from H+ ions combining with water. So yeah, [H3O+] equals [H+], so I can use 1e-11 as the [H+] here.

So the pH would be the negative logarithm of 1e-11. Let me calculate that. Log(1e-11) is -11 because 10^-11 is 1e-11. So the negative of that is 11. So pH = 11.

Now, what does that mean for whether it's acidic or basic? I remember that a pH of 7 is neutral. Below 7 is acidic, above is basic. So 11 is higher than 7, which means it's basic.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that has pH 11 and is basic. Let's look through the choices:

Option D: 9, basic. No, too low.

Option H: 11, basic. That fits.

Option I is 13, basic. That's too high.

So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but wait a second. Sometimes I mix up whether hydronium is H3O+ or OH-. No, hydronium is H3O+ and hydroxide is OH-. So higher [H3O+] means more acidic, but in this case, [H3O+] is 1e-11, which is lower than 1e-7 (which is neutral). Wait, no, wait: in pure water, [H+] is 1e-7, so [H3O+] is also 1e-7, and pH is 7.

If [H3O+] is 1e-11, that's lower than 1e-7, which would mean the solution is less acidic, more basic. Because H+ concentration is lower, so pH is higher than 7. So yes, pH 11 is correct, and the solution is basic.

So the answer is H: 11, basic.

The pH is calculated using the formula \( \text{pH} = -\log[\text{H}^+] \). Given the hydronium ion concentration \([\text{H}_3\text{O}^+] = 10^{-11} \, \text{M}\), which is equivalent to \([\text{H}^+]\), the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log(10^{-11}) = 11
\]

A pH of 11 is greater than 7, indicating that the solution is basic. Among the options, the correct choice is the one with a pH of 11 and a basic classification.

Answer: H
