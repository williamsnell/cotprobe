Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking me to compute (1/3) percent of 1,109. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that the percentage sign means per hundred. So when I see something like 1%, that's 1 per 100, or 0.01 in decimal form. But wait, the question is (1/3) percent. So I need to convert that into a decimal first.

Let me think: 1% is 0.01, so (1/3)% would be (1/3) * 0.01. Oh wait, no, maybe I should think of it differently. Percentage means per hundred, so (1/3)% is (1/3)/100, right? Because 1% is 1/100, so 0.333...% would be (1/3)/100.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let me write it out:

(1/3) % = (1/3) / 100.

So that's the same as 1/(3*100) = 1/300. So 1/300 is approximately 0.00333333...

Okay, so now I have to find this percentage of 1,109. So that means I multiply 1,109 by 0.00333333...

Alternatively, I remember that to find a percentage of a number, you can also multiply the percentage (in decimal) by the number. So 0.003333... multiplied by 1,109.

Let me calculate that. But maybe there's a simpler way. Let's see: 1% of 1,109 is 11.09, because 1% is 1/100, so 1,109 / 100 = 11.09.

But since we're dealing with (1/3)%, that's a third of 1%. So if 1% is 11.09, then (1/3)% would be 11.09 divided by 3.

Wait, that makes sense. Because 1% is 11.09, so 0.333...% would be one third of that. So 11.09 / 3.

Let me compute that. 11 divided by 3 is 3.666..., and 0.09 divided by 3 is 0.03, so altogether that's 3.666... + 0.03 = 3.696... So approximately 3.696?

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 3.696. Let me check the options again.

The options are A: 0.553, B: 0.3697, C:7.218, D:3.6597, E:1.109, F:4.219, G:6.993, H:11.09, I:2.8145, J:5.0948.

Hmm, so option D is 3.6597, which is close to what I got. But wait, maybe I should do the calculation more accurately.

Wait, 11.09 divided by 3. Let me do that division more precisely. 3 goes into 11 three times (3*3=9), remainder 2. Bring down the 0: 20 divided by 3 is 6 (6*3=18), remainder 2. Bring down the 9: 29 divided by 3 is 9 (9*3=27), remainder 2. Now bring down a 0: 20 again, so it's 6 again, and so on. So 11.09 / 3 is 3.696666..., which is approximately 3.6967.

But the option D is 3.6597, which is a bit different. Did I make a mistake in the calculation somewhere?

Wait, alternative approach: let's compute 1,109 * (1/3)%. So that's 1,109 * (1/3)/100 = 1,109 / 300.

Calculating 1,109 divided by 300. Let's see: 300 times 3 is 900, 300*3.6 is 1,080, because 300*3=900 and 300*0.6=180, so 900+180=1,080. So 3.6 times 300 is 1,080. The difference between 1,109 and 1,080 is 29. So 29/300 is approximately 0.096666...

So 3.6 + 0.096666 is 3.696666..., which is 3.696666... So that's the same as before.

Wait, but the option D is 3.6597, which is 3.6597. So that's different. Hmm. Maybe I'm miscalculating something.

Wait another way: 1/3 is approximately 0.3333333. So 0.3333333% is 0.00333333 in decimal. Multiply 1,109 by 0.00333333.

Let me compute that. 1,109 * 0.00333333.

Well, 1,000 * 0.00333333 is 3.33333.

Then, 100 * 0.00333333 is 0.333333.

So 1,000 is 3.33333, 100 is 0.33333, 9 is 0.02999997.

So adding 1,109: that's 1,000 + 100 + 9.

So 3.33333 + 0.33333 = 3.66666, plus 0.03 (from 9 * 0.00333333) is 3.69666. Approximately 3.69666.

So that's about 3.6967, but the option D is 3.6597. Hmm, that's a difference of about 0.037. That's a bit more than 3%.

Wait, maybe I messed up the decimal point? Let me check again. 0.3333333% is 0.003333333 in decimal. 1,109 * 0.003333333.

Let me compute 1,109 * 0.003333333.

Alternatively, 1,109 divided by 300, as earlier.

Wait, 300 times 3.696 is 1,108.8, which is close to 1,109. So 3.696 would be the exact value.

But looking at the options, the closest is D: 3.6597.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me try another approach.

Wait, am I supposed to compute (1/3) percent of 1,109, or is it 1/(3%) of 1,109? No, the question is (1/3)%, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as 1,109 multiplied by (1/3) divided by 100.

So 1,109 * (1/3) = 369.666..., then divided by 100 is 3.69666...

So that's 3.69666..., which is approximately 3.6967.

Wait, but D is 3.6597, which is lower. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, maybe there's an error in the options. Alternatively, am I making a mistake in the calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 1,109 * (1/3) / 100.

Let me compute 1,109 * 1 = 1,109.

Divide by 3: 1,109 / 3 = 369.666... 

Then divide by 100: 3.69666...

Yes, that's 3.69666..., which is approximately 3.6967.

Hmm. So none of the options exactly match. Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 3.6597, which is 3.6597. So that's a bit off. What's the difference?

Wait, 3.6967 minus 3.6597 is 0.037. That's about 1% of 3.6597.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the decimal placement. Let me check again.

Wait, 1/3 is approximately 0.3333333333. So 0.3333333333% is 0.00333333333.

Multiply 1,109 by 0.00333333333 equals:

1,109 * 0.00333333333.

Let me compute this as:

1,109 * 0.003 = 3.327

1,109 * 0.00033333333 = ?

0.00033333333 is approximately 1/3000. So 1,109 / 3000 = approx 0.369666...

So adding 3.327 + 0.369666 = 3.696666...

So again, same result.

Hmm, but the options don't have 3.6967. So am I missing something?

Wait, perhaps the question was (1/3) of 1% of 1,109. So that's the same as (1/3)%, which is what I've been calculating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute (1/3) of 1,109 first, and then take the percentage. No, that doesn't make sense. The question is (1/3) percent of 1,109.

Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 0.553

B:0.3697

C:7.218

D:3.6597

E:1.109

F:4.219

G:6.993

H:11.09

I:2.8145

J:5.0948

Wait, 3.6967 isn't there, but option D is 3.6597. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, another approach: perhaps I'm supposed to compute 1,109 multiplied by (1/3) and then divided by 100, but perhaps I did that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 1,109 divided by 3, which is 369.666..., then take 1% of that, which would be 3.69666...

Alternatively, perhaps the question was phrased differently, but I think I interpreted it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the original question is (1/3) of 1% of 1,109. Which is the same as (1/3)% of 1,109. So same calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the options are for 1/3 of 1,109, which would be 369.666..., but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if the percentage is applied differently.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 3.6967, but the closest option is D:3.6597. Hmm, but that's a significant difference.

Wait, let's see, maybe I made a miscalculation in the initial step.

Wait, 1,109 divided by 300. Let me compute that more accurately.

300 * 3 = 900

Subtract 900 from 1,109: 209 left.

300 * 0.69 = 207.

So 3.69 *300= 1,107.

1,109 -1,107=2.

So 2/300=0.006666...

So 3.69 +0.006666=3.696666...

So that's correct.

Hmm. So I'm getting 3.696666..., which isn't exactly one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, maybe the question is (1/3) percent, so 0.333% of 1,109.

Wait, 0.333% is 0.00333.

1,109 * 0.00333 = let's compute.

1,109 * 0.003 = 3.327

1,109 * 0.00033= 0.366.

So 3.327 + 0.366=3.693.

Hmm, that's approximately 3.693. But option D is 3.6597, which is a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise decimal places.

Wait, 1/3 is 0.3333333333..., so 0.3333333333% is 0.003333333333.

So 1,109 * 0.003333333333.

Let me compute this precisely:

1,109 * 0.003333333333.

Well, 1,000 * 0.003333333333 = 3.333333333.

100 * 0.003333333333 = 0.3333333333.

9 * 0.003333333333 = 0.03.

Adding those together: 3.333333333 + 0.3333333333 = 3.6666666663, plus 0.03 is 3.6966666663.

So again, that's 3.696666..., which is approximately 3.6967.

Hmm, so none of the options match exactly. The closest is D:3.6597, but it's off by about 0.037.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check with a calculator approach.

Wait, let's compute 1,109 ÷ 300.

300 goes into 1,109 how many times?

300 x 3 =900 → subtract from 1,109, you get 209.

Bring down a 0: 2090.

300 x6=1800 → 2090-1800=290.

Bring down a 0: 2900.

300 x9=2700 → 2900-2700=200.

Bring down a 0: 2000.

300 x6=1800 → 2000-1800=200. So we see a repeating pattern.

So 1,109 ÷300 is 3.696666..., so 3.696666... which is approximately 3.6967.

So the correct answer should be approximately 3.6967. But looking at the options, the closest is D:3.6597, but that's not very close.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again.

Wait, the question says (1/3) % of 1,109. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps it's 1.109 multiplied by (1/3)%? No, the question says 'of 1,109' so it's 1,109 multiplied by (1/3)%.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo. Let me check if any option is close to 3.6967. The options are:

A:0.553, B:0.3697, C:7.218, D:3.6597, E:1.109, F:4.219, G:6.993, H:11.09, I:2.8145, J:5.0948.

So D is 3.6597, which is 3.6597. Let me compute the exact difference between 3.6967 and 3.6597.

3.6967 -3.6597=0.037.

Hmm, that's a significant difference. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach: using fractions.

(1/3)% is (1/3)/100 =1/(300).

So 1,109 * (1/300) = 1,109 ÷300.

Which is 3.696666..., as before.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake in the question. Wait, the options include D:3.6597. Let me compute 3.6597 * 300 to see if it's near 1,109.

3.6597 *300= 3.6597 *3 *100 = 10.9791 *100=1,097.91. Which is close to 1,109, but not exact.

Wait, 3.696666... *300=1,109.

Hmm, perhaps the options are incorrect, or perhaps I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is (1 divided by 3%) of 1,109. So 1/(3%) equals approximately 33.3333333%? Wait no, that can't be right.

Wait, wait, no. 3% is 0.03. So 1 divided by 0.03 is approximately 33.3333333. So 33.3333333% of 1,109 would be 0.33333333 *1,109= 369.666..., which isn't among the options either.

But the question says (1/3)%, not 1/(3%).

So that can't be it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is (1/3) multiplied by 1% of 1,109. 1% of 1,109 is 11.09. (1/3)*11.09= 3.696666..., same as before.

Hmm. So I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 3.6967, but that's not an option. The closest is D:3.6597, which is 3.6597.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I've got the question right. Is it (1/3)% of 1,109? Or perhaps (1/3) of 1% of 1,109. Either way, it's the same calculation.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo, and the correct option isn't present. Or perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the options are correct and I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1,109 * 0.001 * (1/3). So 0.001 is 1%, so (1/3) of that is 0.0003333333.

So 1,109 *0.0003333333.

Calculating that:

1,109 *0.0003=0.3327

1,109 *0.0000333333= approx 1,109 *0.00003=0.03327, and 1,109 *0.0000033333≈0.003696.

Adding together: 0.3327 +0.03327=0.36597, plus 0.003696 gives 0.369666... Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.0003333333 is 3.333333e-4. So 1,109 *3.333333e
