Question:

On February 1, a man conveys his orchard to a gardener, and the gardener duly records the conveyance. The following day, the gardener conveys the property to a landscaper; she does not record her deed. Then on February 4, the gardener executes an identical conveyance of the orchard to a friend. The friend gives the gardener a check for $100,000 for the property and records the conveyance, even though he has actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the landscaper. The landscaper, however, records her deed on February 6. The friend then conveys his interest in the farm to an investor, who gives a purchase price of $115,000 to the friend. On February 5, the investor purchases the farm without notice of the conveyance to the landscaper and duly records the deed. Suppose that the jurisdiction in which the property is located has a pure race statute as their deed recordation law. Under these circumstances, which of the aforementioned parties would ultimately prevail?

Options:

A: The gardener.
B: The investor.
C: The friend.
D: The landscaper and the friend jointly.
E: None of the parties, the original man reclaims the property.
F: The friend and the investor jointly.
G: The landscaper.
H: The investor's agent.
I: The jurisdiction in which the property is located.
J: The gardener's friend.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. It's about recording statutes and who ends up with the property. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: On February 1, a man conveys his orchard to a gardener, and the gardener records it. So, the gardener now owns it, right? Then, the next day, February 2, the gardener sells it to a landscaper but doesn't record the deed. So, the landscaper has the deed but hasn't recorded it yet.

Then, on February 4, the gardener sells the same property again to a friend. The friend pays $100k and records the conveyance. But here's the thing: the friend actually knows about the prior sale to the landscaper. That's probably important because it might affect whether the friend is a bona fide purchaser or not.

On February 6, the landscaper records her deed. So, she records after the friend did. But the question is about a pure race jurisdiction. Pure race means that the first to record wins, regardless of notice. So, the priority is based on who records first, not on who had notice.

Wait, but let me make sure. In a pure race statute, the rule is "record first, and you win, even if you had notice of a prior unrecorded interest." So, the key is the order of recording.

So let's map out the timeline.

- Feb 1: Man to Gardener (recorded on Feb 1).
- Feb 2: Gardener to Landscaper (not recorded yet).
- Feb 4: Gardener to Friend. Friend records on Feb 4.
- Feb 6: Landscaper records her deed.

So, between the Landscaper and the Friend, who recorded first? The Friend recorded on Feb 4, and the Landscaper on Feb 6. So Friend recorded first. Under pure race, the Friend's deed would take priority over the Landscaper's, even though the Friend had actual knowledge of the prior conveyance. Because in pure race, notice doesn't matter; it's all about who records first.

But wait, the Friend got the deed from the Gardener on Feb 4. But the Gardener had already conveyed it to the Landscaper on Feb 2. So, the Gardener didn't own it anymore on Feb 4 when he sold it to the Friend. So, the Friend is getting a deed from someone who no longer owns the property. Unless the Landscaper's deed wasn't recorded yet.

But in pure race, as long as the Friend recorded before the Landscaper, the Friend's interest is protected. So even though the Friend had notice, because he recorded first, he's protected against the Landscaper.

Then, the Friend conveys his interest to an Investor on February 5. The Investor buys without notice of the conveyance to the Landscaper and records on February 5. Wait, but the Landscaper records on Feb 6. So, the Investor records on Feb 5, which is before the Landscaper's recording on Feb 6.

Wait, so the Investor is buying from the Friend, who had a recorded deed, and the Investor records before the Landscaper does. So, when the Investor records on Feb 5, the Landscaper's deed is still unrecorded. So, the Investor, as a subsequent purchaser, would take free of any prior unrecorded interests if they meet the requirements.

But wait, under pure race, the Investor's recording would be after the Friend's, but before the Landscaper's. So, the Investor would take priority over the Landscaper because the Investor's recording is before the Landscaper's.

But wait, let me think about the chain. The Friend got the property from the Gardener, recorded on Feb 4. Then, the Friend sells to the Investor, who records on Feb 5, which is before the Landscaper records on Feb 6.

So, the Investor would have a better claim than the Landscaper because the Investor recorded before the Landscaper did. So, the Investor's deed, from the Friend, would be valid against the Landscaper's claim.

But wait, the Landscaper's conveyance was from the Gardener on Feb 2. So, when the Gardener sold to the Friend on Feb 4, he didn't own it anymore. So, the Friend's deed is from someone who didn't own the property. So, the Friend's deed is invalid, right? Because the Gardener had already sold it to the Landscaper.

But in recording acts, the subsequent purchaser's rights depend on their status as a bona fide purchaser (BFP) and the recording. In pure race, the BFP status isn't as crucial because it's all about who records first.

Wait, no. Wait, in pure race, it's about who records first, regardless of whether they had notice. So, even if the Friend had notice of the Landscaper's prior conveyance, if the Friend records before the Landscaper, the Friend's interest is protected. So, the Friend would have a better claim than the Landscaper because the Friend recorded first.

But wait, the Friend is not a BFP because he had actual knowledge. But in pure race, that doesn't matter. So, the Friend would prevail over the Landscaper because he recorded first.

Then, the Friend sells to the Investor on Feb 5, and the Investor records on Feb 5. The Landscaper records on Feb 6. So, the Investor's recording is before the Landscaper's. So, the Investor would take priority over the Landscaper.

So, the Investor would prevail against the Landscaper because the Investor's deed was recorded before the Landscaper's.

Wait, but the Investor is taking from the Friend, who had a recorded deed. So, the Investor is a subsequent purchaser from the Friend. As long as the Friend had a valid interest, the Investor would take it.

But the Friend's interest is valid only if the Friend's recording was effective against the Landscaper. Since Friend recorded before Landscaper, yes. So, the Friend's interest is valid, and thus the Investor's interest is also valid.

So, the Investor would ultimately own the property because their recording was before the Landscaper's.

Wait, but let me double-check. The key is the order of recording. The Friend recorded on Feb 4, Landscaper on Feb 6. So, the Friend's interest is protected against the Landscaper because in pure race, the first to record wins, regardless of notice.

So, the Friend's deed is valid, and when the Friend sells to the Investor, who records on Feb 5, that's before the Landscaper records. So, the Investor's recording is earlier than the Landscaper's, making the Investor's interest superior.

Therefore, the Investor would prevail over the Landscaper.

Wait, but the question asks which party would ultimately prevail. The options are A through J, with B being the Investor and G being the Landscaper.

So, according to this, the Investor would win because they recorded before the Landscaper.

But wait, another angle: when the Friend recorded on Feb 4, the Landscaper's deed was unrecorded. So, when the Friend records, does that make the Landscaper's interest invalid? Or does the Landscaper's recording on Feb 6 make her interest valid?

In pure race, the first to record prevails. So, the Friend recorded first, so the Friend's interest is protected. The Landscaper's recording comes after, so it's too late.

Therefore, the Friend's interest is valid, and when the Friend sells to the Investor, the Investor's recording on Feb 5 is before the Landscaper's on Feb 6. So, the Investor's interest is protected against the Landscaper.

So, the Investor would ultimately prevail against the Landscaper.

Wait, but the Friend had notice. In pure race, notice doesn't matter. So, even if the Friend knew about the Landscaper's prior conveyance, because he recorded first, his interest is protected.

So, the correct answer would be the Investor, option B.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another scenario: the Landscaper's conveyance was on Feb 2, recorded on Feb 6. The Friend's conveyance was on Feb 4, recorded on Feb 4. So, the Friend recorded before the Landscaper. So, under pure race, Friend's interest takes priority.

Then, the Friend conveys to the Investor on Feb 5. The Investor records on Feb 5, before the Landscaper's recording on Feb 6. So, the Investor's recording is earlier than the Landscaper's.

Therefore, the Investor's interest is protected, and the Landscaper's recording is too late to affect the Investor.

So, the Investor would prevail.

Looking at the answer options, option B is the Investor.

In a jurisdiction with a pure race statute, the rule is "record first, and you win," regardless of notice. The timeline of events is as follows:

1. **February 1**: The man conveys the orchard to the gardener, and the gardener records the deed. The gardener now owns the property.
2. **February 2**: The gardener conveys the orchard to the landscaper, but the landscaper does not record the deed at this time.
3. **February 4**: The gardener conveys the orchard to the friend. The friend records the deed on the same day (February 4). Although the friend had actual knowledge of the prior conveyance to the landscaper, under a pure race statute, notice does not matter—only the order of recording matters.
4. **February 5**: The friend conveys the orchard to the investor. The investor records the deed on the same day (February 5).
5. **February 6**: The landscaper records her deed.

Under the pure race statute, the first to record prevails. The friend recorded on February 4, before the landscaper recorded on February 6. Therefore, the friend's interest is protected against the landscaper's claim. When the friend conveys the property to the investor, and the investor records on February 5 (before the landscaper records on February 6), the investor's interest is also protected. 

Thus, the investor ultimately prevails because their recording was before the landscaper's recording.
