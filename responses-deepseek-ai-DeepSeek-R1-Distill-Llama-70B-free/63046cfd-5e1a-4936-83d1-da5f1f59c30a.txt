Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about heat transfer between steam and ice. Hmm, let's see what it says. Oh right, the question is about how much ice can be melted at 0°C using the heat released when steam condenses. The given data includes the heat of vaporization and fusion. Alright, I'm a bit rusty, but let's break it down.

So, the problem states that 100 grams of steam at 100°C is condensing to liquid. I remember that when steam condenses, it releases heat. The heat of vaporization is the amount of heat required to turn liquid into vapor, so the reverse process (condensing) would release that same amount of heat. Oh right, the heat of vaporization is 540 cal/g. So for 100 grams, the heat released should be 540 cal/g multiplied by 100 g. Let me write that down: 540 * 100 = 54,000 calories. Wait, wait, wait—wait, no, wait. Wait, 540 cal/g times 100 g is 54,000 cal? Or is it 540 cal per gram, so 100g is 54,000? Yes, that's correct. So that's the total heat available.

Now, this heat is going to be used to melt ice. Ice is at 0°C, and we want to melt it. The heat of fusion is the amount of heat needed to melt ice without changing temperature. The heat of fusion given is 80 cal/g. So the process is, the heat released by condensing steam (540 cal/g * 100g) will be equal to the heat required to melt the ice (80 cal/g * mass of ice).

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, right, because when the steam condenses, it's turning into water at 100°C. But ice is at 0°C. So does the water cool down from 100°C to 0°C as well? Oh, wait, the question says the ice is at 0°C and the steam is condensing to liquid. Oh, wait, no, the steam is at 100°C. So when it condenses, it becomes water at 100°C, right? So that water is going to cool down from 100°C to 0°C, releasing more heat in the process. Oh wait, but the question says the heat is from condensing. So perhaps the question is only considering the latent heat of condensation, not the cooling of the water afterwards. Hmm, the wording is "heat liberated by condensing 100 g of steam at 100°C to liquid." So that would only include the latent heat, right? Because condensing is turning steam to liquid, which is at the same temperature. So the heat released is just the latent heat part, not including any sensible heat from cooling the liquid. Because the problem states it's the heat from condensing, not from cooling. So I think I'm correct in just using 540 cal/g * 100g.

So the heat released is 54,000 calories. And this heat is used to melt ice. The heat required to melt mass m of ice is 80 cal/g * m. So setting them equal: 540*100 = 80*m. So m = (540 * 100) / 80. Let me compute that. 540 times 100 is 54,000. Divided by 80. 54,000 /80. Let's see, 80 times 675 is 54,000. Because 80 * 600 is 48,000, 80 *75 is 6,000. 48k +6k is 54k. So m is 675 grams. So looking at the options, option C is 675 g. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait another thought. Oh, wait, no, because when the steam condenses, it becomes water at 100°C. So perhaps that water will then release heat as it cools down to 0°C, which can also be used to melt ice. Oh! I totally forgot about that part. So the heat from condensation is only part of the story. The rest comes from the water cooling.

Oh, right, I think I missed that. So the total heat available is the heat released when the steam condenses (latent heat) plus the heat released when the resulting water cools from 100°C to 0°C (sensible heat).

So let me recalculate. The total heat released would be:

Heat of condensation (Q1) = mass * heat of vaporization = 100g *540 cal/g = 54,000 cal.

Heat released when cooling water from 100°C to 0°C (Q2) = mass * specific heat * temp change. The specific heat of water is about 1 cal/g°C. So Q2 = 100g * 1 cal/g°C * (100°C - 0°C) = 100 * 100 = 10,000 cal.

So total heat available is Q1 + Q2 = 54000 + 10000 = 64,000 cal.

Now, this heat is used to melt ice. The heat needed is Q = mass * heat of fusion. So 64,000 cal = m *80 cal/g. Solving for m: m=64000/80 = 800 g.

Wait, but looking at the options, 800 g isn't an option. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 600 g

B:540

C:675

D:900

E:720

F:450

G:1000

H:750

I:850

J:810

Hmm, 800 is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, maybe the steam is at 100°C, and when it condenses, it's water at 100°C, which then cools to 0°C. So that's correct.

Wait, let me recompute the numbers.

Q1 = 100g *540 cal/g =54,000 cal.

Q2 =100g *1 cal/g°C *100°C =10,000 cal.

Total Q=64,000 cal.

Heat needed to melt ice: m=64000/80 =800 g.

But the options don't have 800. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in some assumption. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says: What weight of ice could be melted at 0°C by the heat liberated by condensing 100 g of steam at 100°C to liquid. So it says 'by condensing', so perhaps only the latent heat is considered. Because condensing only releases the latent heat. The cooling of the water is a separate process. So perhaps the problem doesn't include the sensible heat from cooling. Because the question is only about the heat from condensing.

So that would make the heat available just 54,000 cal, which would melt 675 grams of ice.

So in that case, the correct answer would be option C:675g.

But wait, another angle: When steam condenses, it's releasing latent heat, and then the condensed water is at 100°C. If that water is then used to melt ice, which is at 0°C, then the water will cool down, releasing more heat. So the total heat would be the sum of both processes.

But the question's wording is a bit ambiguous. It says "the heat liberated by condensing". So perhaps it's only the heat from condensation. So the correct approach is to calculate only the latent heat part.

Alternatively, if the question includes all the heat that the steam gives off as it becomes liquid at 0°C, then we have to include both parts.

Wait, perhaps interpreting the question as the heat released when the steam becomes liquid at 0°C. That is, the steam is condensed and then cooled to 0°C. So then the total heat is 540*100 (condensing) + 100*100 (cooling from 100 to 0) =64000 cal.

So m=64000/80=800g. But since 800 isn't an option, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, the options don't have 800. Hmm, perhaps the question is only considering the latent heat. So in that case, the answer is 675 grams, option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 540 cal/g *100g =54,000 cal.

If we use that to melt ice: 54,000 /80 =675 grams.

Yes, that's correct.

But if we include the sensible heat, 540 + (100 * 1) = 640 per gram. So 100g steam: 54,000 + 10,000 =64,000.

64,000 /80 =800g.

Hmm, but 800 is not an option. So why isn't it an option? Let me recheck the problem statement.

The question is: What weight of ice could be melted at 0°C by the heat liberated by condensing 100 g of steam at 100°C to liquid.

So the process is:

Steam → (condenses) → water at 100°C.

So the heat from this process is 540 cal/g *100g=54,000 cal.

But the water is at 100°C, and the ice is at 0°C. So if the system is such that the water can cool down to 0°C, releasing additional heat, then the total heat would be 54,000 + (100g)(1 cal/g°C)(100°C) =64,000 cal.

But the problem doesn't explicitly say whether the water cools down. So perhaps the question is considering only the heat from condensation, not the subsequent cooling.

In that case, the answer is 675g, which is option C.

Looking at the options, option C is 675g. So I think that's the correct approach.

To determine how much ice can be melted at 0°C by the heat liberated when 100 g of steam at 100°C condenses to liquid, we analyze the heat transfer process.

### Key Data:
1. **Heat of vaporization** = 540 cal/g  
   This is the heat released when steam condenses to liquid at 100°C.  
   Heat released during condensation:  
   \[
   Q_1 = \text{mass} \times \text{heat of vaporization} = 100 \, \text{g} \times 540 \, \text{cal/g} = 54,000 \, \text{cal}
   \]

2. **Heat of fusion** = 80 cal/g  
   This is the heat required to melt ice at 0°C.  

3. **Heat released by cooling water from 100°C to 0°C (sensible heat):**  
   The specific heat of water is approximately 1 cal/g°C.  
   Heat released during cooling:  
   \[
   Q_2 = \text{mass} \times \text{specific heat} \times \text{temperature change} = 100 \, \text{g} \times 1 \, \text{cal/g°C} \times 100 \, \text{°C} = 10,000 \, \text{cal}
   \]

### Interpretation of the Question:
The question asks for the weight of ice that can be melted by the heat "liberated by condensing 100 g of steam at 100°C to liquid." This phrasing suggests that only the heat released during condensation (\(Q_1\)) is to be considered, not the additional heat released when the condensed water cools to 0°C (\(Q_2\)).

### Calculation:
The heat released during condensation is \(Q_1 = 54,000 \, \text{cal}\). This heat is used to melt ice, so:  
\[
\text{Mass of ice melted} = \frac{Q_1}{\text{heat of fusion}} = \frac{54,000 \, \text{cal}}{80 \, \text{cal/g}} = 675 \, \text{g}
\]

### Conclusion:
The weight of ice that can be melted is 675 g. This corresponds to **option C**.
