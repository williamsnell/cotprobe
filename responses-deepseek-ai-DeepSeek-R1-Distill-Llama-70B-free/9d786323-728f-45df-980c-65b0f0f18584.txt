Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a car braking and the heat generated in the drum. Hmm, I remember that when a car brakes, the kinetic energy is converted into heat. So the problem gives me a lot of details, and I need to compute three things: temperature increase, mean power in the first second, and average power overall.

Let me start by listing all the given data. The car weighs 3500 lbs, which I think I should convert into mass. Wait, weight is mass times gravity. Oh right, in the English system, weight in pounds is mass in slugs multiplied by 32.174 lb-ft/s². So mass m = weight / g. Let me calculate that. So 3500 lbs divided by 32.174 gives me approximately 108.7 slugs. Wait, let me check that calculation again. 3500 / 32.174. Let me compute that. 32.174 times 100 is 3217.4, so 108 slugs would be 32.174 * 108 = 3478. So 108 slugs is about 3480 lbs. So 3500 would be around 108.7 slugs. Okay.

The car's average speed is 55 mph. I need to convert that into feet per second because the deceleration is given in fps². To convert mph to fps, I multiply by 5280/3600, which is 22/15. So 55 * (22/15) = (55*22)/15. 55*22 is 1210. 1210 divided by 15 is approximately 80.6667 fps. So average speed is about 80.6667 fps.

The deceleration is a constant 25 fps². The car comes to rest, so initial velocity is 80.6667, final is 0. The time taken to stop can be found using v = u + at. So 0 = 80.6667 + (-25)t → t = 80.6667 /25 ≈ 3.2267 seconds. So the car stops in about 3.2267 seconds.

Now, the braking is done by a drum with diameter 10 inches. So radius is 5 inches, which is 5/12 feet. The band has a face width of 2 inches and thickness of 1/4 inch.

I think the first part is to calculate the heat generated, which is the kinetic energy the car had. Then, that heat is absorbed by the drum, so the temperature change depends on the drum's mass and specific heat. Wait, but the problem doesn't give the drum's mass. Hmm, maybe I missed that. Let me check the question again. Oh, wait, maybe I can find the mass from the dimensions of the drum? Because the drum's dimensions are given, but not the material, so perhaps they expect me to assume the drum is made of steel or something. Wait, but I don't have that info. Hmm, maybe the problem assumes that all the kinetic energy goes into heating the drum. Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives the mass of the drum elsewhere, but I don't see it. Oh wait, maybe the drum's dimensions can help me find its mass. Let's see, the drum is a cylinder, I think. The diameter is 10 inches, so radius is 5 inches. The width is the face width of the band, which is 2 inches. Wait, no, the face width is 2 inches. Hmm, but a drum's dimensions usually are diameter and length (or width). So the volume would be area of the circular face times the width. So volume V = π r² * width. r is 5 inches, width is 2 inches. So V = π*(5)^2 *2 = 50π cubic inches. But I need to convert that to cubic feet, since the weight is in pounds. Wait, 1 foot is 12 inches. So 1 cubic foot is 12^3 = 1728 cubic inches. So V = 50π / 1728 ≈ (157.08)/1728 ≈ 0.0909 cubic feet.

Assuming the drum is made of steel, the density of steel is about 490 pounds per cubic foot. So mass m = density * volume = 490 lb/ft³ * 0.0909 ft³ ≈ 44.54 pounds. But wait, weight is mass times g, so the mass in slugs would be weight divided by g (32.174). So m = 44.54 lb / 32.174 ≈ 1.383 slugs. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I'm supposed to compute this. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the given dimensions to find the surface area for heat dissipation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the heat is absorbed by the drum, and the drum's mass is calculated from its volume and density.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy and equate it to the heat, then use the specific heat capacity of steel to find the temperature rise. But without the mass, I can't proceed. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem gives the drum's diameter, band face width, and thickness. Maybe the band's dimensions are a distraction. Alternatively, perhaps the drum's mass is the volume times density. So, let's proceed under that assumption.

So, the car's kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Wait, but in the English system, the formula is (1/2)mv², where m is in slugs, v in fps, giving energy in foot-pounds. So the car's mass is 3500 lbs weight, so m = 3500 /32.174 ≈ 108.7 slugs. So KE = 0.5 * 108.7 * (80.6667)^2.

Let me compute that. 80.6667 squared is about 6511.1. So 0.5 *108.7 *6511.1. 0.5 *108.7 is 54.35. 54.35 *6511.1 ≈ 54 *6500 is 351,000, so approximately 354,000 foot-pounds. Wait, let me compute more accurately. 108.7 * 80.6667^2 = 108.7 * (80.6667)^2.

80.6667 is 80 and 2/3, which is 242/3. So (242/3)^2 = (58564)/(9) ≈ 6511.555… So 108.7 *6511.555 ≈ Let me compute 100 *6511.555 = 651155.5, 8.7 *6511.555 ≈ 56691. So total is about 651,155.5 +56,691= 707,846.5. Then, multiply by 0.5 gives 353,923 foot-pounds.

So KE ≈ 353,923 ft-lbf.

Now, this KE is converted into heat, which goes into the drum. So Q = 353,923 ft-lbf. Now, to find the temperature change, we use Q = m * c * ΔT, where m is mass of drum, c is specific heat of steel. Specific heat of steel is about 0.11 BTU/lb·°F. Wait, but I'm working in foot-pounds, so I need to convert units appropriately.

Wait, 1 BTU is about 778 ft-lbf. So Q in BTU is 353,923 / 778 ≈ 454.7 BTU.

Now, Q = m * c * ΔT → ΔT = Q/(m*c).

I need the mass of the drum in pounds. Earlier, I calculated the volume as 0.0909 cubic feet, and density 490 lb/ft³, so mass m = 490 *0.0909 ≈ 44.54 pounds.

So ΔT = 454.7 / (44.54 *0.11) → let's compute denominator: 44.54 *0.11 ≈ 4.899.

So ΔT ≈ 454.7 /4.899 ≈ 92.8 °F. Hmm, looking at the options, option G is 92°F. Option C is 99, option I is 88, etc. So that's part (a). So (a) is about 93°F, so looking at the options, G is 92°F, which is close.

Now, part (b): mean rate of power absorption in the first second. Power is work done per unit time. The work done in the first second is the energy absorbed in that second. So I need to find the energy used in the first second, then divide by 1 second to get power in horsepower.

Wait, the car is decelerating at 25 fps². So the velocity at any time t is u + at. So at t=0, v =80.6667 fps. At t=1, v =80.6667 -25*1 =55.6667 fps. The average velocity during the first second is (80.6667 +55.6667)/2 =68.1667 fps.

The distance covered in the first second is average velocity multiplied by time: 68.1667 *1 =68.1667 feet.

The work done is force times distance. The force here is the braking force, which is mass times deceleration. So F = m*a =108.7 slugs *25 fps² =2717.5 lb. So work done is F*d =2717.5 *68.1667 ≈ Let's compute that. 2717.5 *68 = 2717.5 *70=190,225 minus 2717.5*2=5435 → 190,225-5,435=184,790. Then 0.1667 *2717.5≈ 453. So total ≈185,243 ft-lbf.

Convert that to horsepower. Since 1 horsepower is 550 ft-lbf per second. So power is 185,243 ft-lbf per second, but wait, no, the work is done over 1 second, so the rate is 185,243 /1 =185,243 ft-lbf/sec. So divide by 550 to get hp: 185,243 /550 ≈337.345 hp. Hmm, that's about 337 hp. Looking at the options, option C has 337 hp as the mean rate in the first second, and option A has 350, etc.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the distance. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact work done in the first second.

Wait, another approach: the power at any instant is F*v(t). So the power as a function of time is P(t) = m*a*v(t), since F=ma, and v(t) decreases from u to u -a*1. So the average power in the first second is the average of P(0) and P(1). Because power is changing linearly with time as velocity decreases.

So P(0) = m*a*u =108.7 *25 *80.6667. Let's compute that. 108.7 *25 =2717.5. 2717.5 *80.6667 ≈ let's compute 2717.5 *80=217,400, 2717.5 *0.6667≈1,811. So total ≈219,211 ft-lbf/s → 219,211 /550 ≈398 hp.

P(1) = m*a*(u -a*1) =108.7 *25 * (80.6667 -25) =108.7 *25 *55.6667. So 25*55.6667 is 1,391.6675. 108.7 *1391.6675 ≈ let's compute 100*1391.67=139,167, 8.7*1391.67≈12,122. So total ≈151,289. So P(1)=151,289 ft-lbf/s → 151,289 /550 ≈274.7 hp.

So average power over first second is (398 +274.7)/2 ≈336.35 hp. So that's approximately 336 hp, which matches the earlier calculation of about 337 hp. So part (b) is 337 hp, which is option C.

Wait, but option C's part (a) is 99°F, but our calculation for (a) was around 93°F, which is option G. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in my (a) calculation.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the mass of the drum. Let me go back. The drum's volume is π r² * width. r is 5 inches, width is 2 inches, so volume in cubic inches is π*(5)^2 *2 =50π ≈157.08 in³. Convert to cubic feet: 1 ft³ = 12³ =1728 in³. So 157.08 /1728 ≈0.0909 ft³.

Density of steel is 490 lb/ft³. So mass is 0.0909 *490 ≈44.54 lb.

Wait, but in the specific heat formula, Q = m c ΔT, m is in lb, but I think the specific heat is in BTU/(lb·°F). So with Q in BTU, m in lb, c in BTU/(lb·°F), then ΔT is in °F.

So earlier, I had Q as 353,923 ft-lbf, which is 353923 /778 ≈454.7 BTU.

So ΔT = 454.7 / (44.54 *0.11) → 454.7 /4.899 ≈92.8°F. So option G is 92°F, which would be (a) 92°F, (b) 300 hp, (c) 175 hp. Wait, but according to our calculation for (b), it's 337 hp, which is option C's value. So there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about the drum's mass. Maybe the problem expects the mass of the brake drum to be calculated differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides the drum's dimensions and the band's dimensions to compute the area, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the work done as the average torque multiplied by the angular displacement. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is using the weight of the drum. Wait, no, the car's weight is given, not the drum's. So perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the entire kinetic energy is absorbed by the drum, and that the drum's mass is the given weight, which is 3500 lbs. That can't be right, because the car's mass is 3500 lbs, not the drum. So that would make no sense.

Wait, perhaps the band's dimensions are important. The band's face width is 2 inches, thickness 1/4 inch. Hmm, maybe the band's area is used for something else, but I'm not seeing how that would affect the temperature change.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the drum's rotational inertia. Because when the car brakes, the drum rotates, and the kinetic energy is the rotational energy plus the translational. But wait, the car's KE is (1/2)mv², and when it stops, all that energy is converted into heat. So I think the drum's rotational KE is part of the car's KE, so that approach might not be necessary.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. According to my calculations, part (a) is 92.8°F, and part (b) is 337 hp. Looking at the options, option C has (a) 99°F, (b) 337 hp, and (c) 199 hp. Option G has (a) 92°F, (b) 300 hp, (c) 175 hp.

So my (a) aligns with option G, but (b) aligns with option C. So perhaps I made a mistake in part (a). Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the car's average speed is 55 mph, but when calculating KE, I should use the initial speed, not the average. Because the average speed during braking is given, but the KE is (1/2)mv_initial², assuming it comes to rest. So that part was correct.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the specific heat value. I used 0.11 BTU/(lb·°F) for steel, but maybe it's different. Let me check: the specific heat of steel is around 0.11 to 0.12 BTU/(lb·°F). So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the drum's mass is much larger than what I calculated. Maybe the drum's dimensions are not just the 10-inch diameter and 2-inch width. Wait, 10-inch diameter drum would have a radius of 5 inches, and the width is 2 inches. So the volume is π*r²*length, which in this case, the length is the width of the drum, perhaps, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the drum is a cylinder with diameter 10 inches and length 2 inches. So volume would be π*(5)^2*2 =50π in³, which is what I did before.

Wait, maybe the thickness of 1/4 inch is the drum's wall thickness. So perhaps the drum is a hollow cylinder with outer diameter 10 inches, inner diameter less by twice the thickness. So inner radius is (5 inches - 0.25/2) ? Wait, the thickness is 1/4 inch, so the inner radius would be 5 - 0.25 =4.75 inches? Or is the thickness the width of the drum wall? Hmm, maybe I should model the drum as a solid cylinder. No, that's not right. Brake drums are usually hollow, so perhaps I should compute the mass as the volume of the drum material, which would be the volume of the outer cylinder minus the inner.

But without the inner diameter given, I can't compute that. So perhaps the problem assumes the drum is solid. In that case, the volume is as before, 50π cubic inches, leading to a mass of ~44.54 lb.

Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the specific heat formula. Let me re-calculate ΔT.

Q = 353,923 ft-lbf = 353923 /778 ≈454.7 BTU.

Mass m =44.54 lb.

c =0.11 BTU/(lb·°F).

ΔT = 454.7 / (44.54 *0.11) →44.54 *0.11 =4.8994.

So 454.7 /4.8994 ≈92.8°F. So that's correct.

So part (a) is approximately 93°F, matching
