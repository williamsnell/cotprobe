Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about the percentage of Germans who think the relationship between the U.S. and Germany is good as of 2019. The options are from A to J, with various percentages. 

First, I remember that around 2019, there were some tensions between the U.S. and Germany. I think Trump was president then, and he had some disagreements with Germany, especially regarding NATO spending and trade. So maybe that affected the public opinion.

I've heard that despite political tensions, many Germans still view the U.S. positively, but I'm not sure about the exact percentage. I recall some surveys from that time. Maybe it was around 60-something percent? Or perhaps higher. Wait, I'm not certain. 

I think Pew Research Center does a lot of these global attitude surveys. They might have asked about this. If I remember correctly, in some years the percentage was around 70%, but I'm not sure if that's the case for 2019 specifically. 

Alternatively, I think there was a survey where about 64% of Germans said the relationship was good. That number sounds familiar. But wait, another thought: maybe it was lower because of the trade disputes and other issues during that time. So perhaps it was around 55% or so. 

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of other factors. The U.S. and Germany have a long-standing alliance, so the public opinion might still be relatively positive. If it's about 64%, that would make sense. But I'm not 100% sure. 

I guess another approach is to eliminate some options. The higher options like 79%, 85%, 90% seem too high given the political climate. The lower ones like 25%, 15% seem too low. So maybe it's somewhere in the middle. 

Between the options, 64% is option C, 55% is E, 70% is F, 49% is I. Hmm. I think I've heard that around two-thirds of Germans viewed the relationship positively, so that would be around 66-67%, but the closest option is 64% (C) or 70% (F). 

Alternatively, maybe it was 70% in a different year, but for 2019, perhaps it dipped a bit. So 64% might be more accurate. 

Wait, another angle: during Trump's presidency, there were reports of declining trust in the U.S. among Germans. So perhaps the percentage went down compared to previous years. If in 2019 it was lower, maybe around 55% or 64%. 

I'm still not entirely sure. I think I've read that a majority still considered the relationship good, but not an overwhelming majority. So 64% sounds plausible. 

I'm going to go with option C: 64%.

The answer is based on considering the context of U.S.-Germany relations around 2019, including political tensions during Trump's presidency. Despite these issues, a majority of Germans likely maintained a positive view. After evaluating the options and recalling surveys, 64% seems plausible.
