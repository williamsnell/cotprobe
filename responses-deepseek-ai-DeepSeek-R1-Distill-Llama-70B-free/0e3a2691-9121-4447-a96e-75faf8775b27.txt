Okay, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about property law. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step.

The question involves a homeowner who conveys his property to his cousin for life, with a remainder to the homeowner's heirs. Later, the cousin conveys the property to a farmer for as long as the farmer continues to farm the property. After the cousin's death, the homeowner's heirs sue the farmer to quiet title. The question is about which common law doctrine applies here.

First, I need to break down the conveyances. The initial conveyance is from the homeowner to the cousin. The cousin gets a life estate, and the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs. So the cousin has a life estate, and the remainder is vested in the heirs because it's not subject to a conditionâ€”it's a remainder that will take effect upon the cousin's death.

Then, the cousin conveys the property to a farmer "for as long as he would continue to farm the property." Wait, that sounds like a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. No, actually, it's a fee simple determinable because it's "for as long as..." which creates a possibility of reverter. So the cousin, who has a life estate, is trying to convey an interest that lasts potentially longer than his own life.

But wait, the cousin only has a life estate. So when he conveys to the farmer for as long as he farms, what does that mean? The cousin can only convey what he has, which is a life estate. So the farmer's interest can't outlast the cousin's life estate because the cousin can't give more than he has.

But wait, the conveyance to the farmer is "for as long as he would continue to farm the property." So, the farmer has an estate that could last beyond the cousin's life if the condition is met. But the cousin only has a life estate, so any interest he conveys can't extend beyond his own life. So the farmer's estate would actually be a life estate as well, measured by the cousin's life, but with a condition attached? Or is it a lease for the duration of farming?

Alternatively, maybe the cousin's conveyance creates a fee simple determinable, but since the cousin only has a life estate, the farmer's estate would only last for the cousin's life. Because the cousin can't grant a longer interest than he holds.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think about the possible doctrines.

Option D is the Rule in Shelley's Case. That rule applies when a life estate is given to one person and a remainder to that person's heirs. The rule says that the remainder is converted into a fee simple because it's assumed that the grantor meant to give the remainder to the life tenant's heirs, which would merge into a fee simple.

But in this case, the initial conveyance is to the cousin for life, with remainder to the homeowner's heirs, not the cousin's heirs. So the Rule in Shelley's Case wouldn't apply here because the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs, not the cousin's.

Option E is the Doctrine of Destructibility of Contingent Remainders. That applies when a remainder is contingent and the interest is terminated before it vests. But in our case, the remainder is vested because it's to the homeowner's heirs, which is a specific class that can be ascertained. So it's a vested remainder, not contingent.

Wait, no. Actually, the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs. That's a class that is subject to change, but at the time of conveyance, it's a vested remainder subject to open. So the Doctrine of Destructibility applies to contingent remainders, not vested ones. So E might not be the right choice.

Option C is the Doctrine of Worthier Title. That applies when a grantor attempts to create a future interest that would take the property away upon the grantor's death, but the grantor's heirs would take under the rules of intestacy. So if the grantor tries to create a remainder to someone else, but under intestacy, the property would go to the grantor's heirs, the Doctrine of Worthier Title invalidates that. But in this case, the initial conveyance is to the cousin for life, then to the grantor's heirs. So the remainder is valid, because it's not to a third party but to the grantor's own heirs. So the Doctrine of Worthier Title doesn't apply here.

Option H is the Rule in Wild's Case. That's about the validity of contingent remainders after a vested remainder has been created. Wait, Wild's Case says that if a vested remainder is followed by a contingent remainder, the contingent is destroyed if there's a condition precedent that is not met before the vested remainder terminates. But in our case, the initial conveyance is a life estate to cousin, then to the homeowner's heirs. That's a vested remainder, not contingent. So when the cousin conveys to the farmer, perhaps creating a springing interest?

Wait, the cousin only has a life estate. So when he conveys to the farmer "for as long as he farms," the farmer's interest can't extend beyond the cousin's life. Because the cousin can't grant an estate longer than he has. So the farmer's estate would end when the cousin dies.

But the farmer is still in possession after the cousin's death, so the heirs are suing. The issue is whether the farmer's interest survives the cousin's death.

So the farmer's interest is a fee simple determinable, but since the cousin only has a life estate, the farmer's interest is limited by the cousin's life. So the farmer's estate would terminate when the cousin dies, which is what happened. So the farmer's interest ends, and the remainder (to the homeowner's heirs) takes effect.

Wait, but the farmer's conveyance was for as long as he farms. If the farmer continues to farm beyond the cousin's life, can he stay? But the cousin's life estate ended, so the farmer's interest, which was tied to the cousin's life, would end. So the heirs now have the property.

But the question is about the applicable doctrine. So what's the issue here? It's about whether the cousin could convey an interest that would continue beyond his life. He couldn't, because he only had a life estate. So the farmer's interest is limited to the life estate.

Wait, perhaps the cousin's conveyance to the farmer was an attempt to create a fee simple determinable, but because the cousin only held a life estate, the farmer's interest is a life estate pur autre vie. Because the duration is tied to the cousin's life.

Wait, that might tie into the Doctrine of Life Estate Pur Autre Vie, which is option B. Let me think. A life estate pur autre vie is measured by the life of someone other than the holder. So if the farmer's interest is for as long as he farms, but the duration can't exceed the cousin's life, then the farmer's estate is a life estate pur autre vie.

But wait, the conveyance was "for as long as he (the farmer) would continue to farm." That sounds like it could last beyond the cousin's life if the farmer continues farming. But since the cousin only has a life estate, the farmer's interest can't outlast that. So perhaps the farmer's interest is a determinable fee simple, but subject to the termination of the cousin's life estate.

Alternatively, the cousin's conveyance is a lease determinable, but the key point is that the cousin can't grant more than he has. So the farmer's interest is a life estate, because it's tied to the cousin's life.

So when the cousin dies, the farmer's interest ends, and the remainder to the homeowner's heirs takes effect. So the heirs can evict the farmer.

Therefore, the doctrine that applies is the Doctrine of Life Estate Pur Autre Vie, because the farmer's interest is measured by the cousin's life, not his own.

Wait, but another thought: the cousin, holding a life estate, conveys an estate that could potentially last longer than his life. But because he can only convey up to his own interest, the farmer's interest is limited. So the farmer gets a life estate pur autre vie, which ends when the cousin dies. So the applicable doctrine is B.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the Doctrine of Merger, but that's when the same person holds two estates that merge into one. That doesn't seem applicable here.

Wait, another approach: the cousin had a life estate, and he conveyed an estate to the farmer. The farmer's estate is a fee simple determinable, but since the cousin only had a life estate, the farmer's interest is a life estate pur autre vie. Therefore, when the cousin dies, the farmer's interest ends, and the remainder vests in the homeowner's heirs.

So the applicable doctrine is the Doctrine of Life Estate Pur Autre Vie, which is option B.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about what each doctrine entails.

- Doctrine of Lapse (A): When a contingent interest fails because the beneficiary dies before the life tenant. Not applicable here because the remainder is vested.

- B: Life Estate Pur Autre Vie. Yes, the farmer's estate is measured by the cousin's life.

- C: Worthier Title. When a grantor's heir would take under intestacy, making the grant to another invalid. Not applicable because the remainder is to the grantor's heirs, so no issue.

- D: Shelley's Case. Applies when remainder to life tenant's heirs, converting to fee simple. Not the case here.

- E: Destructibility. Applies to contingent remainders. Our case has a vested remainder.

- F: Rule against Perpetuities. Not relevant here because the interest doesn't violate the rule.

- G: Merger. Not applicable because the same person doesn't hold both estates.

- H: Wild's Case. Dealing with contingent remainders after a vested one. Not applicable.

- I: Rule against Remainders in Grantees' Heirs. Not applicable.

- J: Adverse Possession. Not relevant.

So the correct answer is B: Doctrine of Life Estate Pur Autre Vie.

The question involves a homeowner who conveys property to a cousin for life, with a remainder to the homeowner's heirs. The cousin then conveys the property to a farmer "for as long as he would continue to farm the property." After the cousin's death, the homeowner's heirs sue the farmer to quiet title. The issue is to determine which common law doctrine applies.

1. **Initial Conveyance**: The homeowner conveys the property to the cousin for life, with a remainder to the homeowner's heirs. The cousin has a life estate, and the remainder is vested in the homeowner's heirs.

2. **Cousin's Conveyance to the Farmer**: The cousin conveys the property to the farmer "for as long as he would continue to farm the property." This language suggests a fee simple determinable. However, the cousin only holds a life estate, so the farmer's interest cannot exceed the cousin's life estate. Therefore, the farmer's interest is limited to a life estate pur autre vie, measured by the cousin's life.

3. **After the Cousin's Death**: The farmer's interest, being tied to the cousin's life, terminates upon the cousin's death. The remainder to the homeowner's heirs then vests.

4. **Analysis of Doctrines**:
   - **Doctrine of Life Estate Pur Autre Vie (B)**: This doctrine applies because the farmer's interest is measured by the cousin's life, not the farmer's own life. This matches the facts of the case.
   - **Rule in Shelley's Case (D)**: Not applicable because the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs, not the cousin's heirs.
   - **Doctrine of Destructibility of Contingent Remainders (E)**: Not applicable because the remainder is vested, not contingent.
   - **Doctrine of Worthier Title (C)**: Not applicable because the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs, not a third party.
   - **Other Doctrines**: Such as lapse, merger, Wild's Case, and adverse possession, do not apply to the facts.

The most applicable doctrine is the **Doctrine of Life Estate Pur Autre Vie**, as it explains that the farmer's interest is limited by the cousin's life and terminates upon the cousin's death.

**Answer: B**
