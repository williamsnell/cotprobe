Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the mean ionic activity of a sodium phosphate solution. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says it's a 0.0350 molal (m) Na3PO4 solution, and the mean activity coefficient is 0.685. I need to find the mean ionic activity from the options given.

Wait, right, mean ionic activity. I remember that for an electrolyte that dissociates into ions, the mean activity is related to the molality and the activity coefficients.

So, sodium phosphate is Na3PO4. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into ions. Let me think: Na3PO4 → 3 Na+ + PO4^3-.

So each formula unit produces 3 sodium ions and 1 phosphate ion. So the total number of ions is 4, but the charges are +1 each for Na and -3 for phosphate.

But wait, for activity, I think it's about the mean ionic activity, which depends on the concentration of each ion and their activity coefficients. Oh right, I remember the formula for mean activity coefficient (γ±) is based on the Debye-Hückel equation or something, but here they give us the mean activity coefficient directly, so I don't need to calculate that part.

The mean ionic activity (a±) is given by the formula: a± = γ± * (ionic strength)^something? Or wait, maybe it's the product of the ion concentrations each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients, all multiplied by the mean activity coefficient.

Wait, I think the formula is a± = γ± * (m_i), where m_i is the mean ionic molality. Or is it something else?

Wait, the mean ionic activity is calculated using the formula: a± = γ± * (m)^(ν), where ν is the number of ions. No, wait, maybe it's the product of each ion's activity. Oh, right, the mean activity is the geometric mean of the individual ion activities.

Wait, let's think again. The individual ions' activities are a_Na+ and a_PO4^3-. But the mean activity a± is given by (a_Na+^3 * a_PO4^3-)^(1/4), because there are 3 Na+ and 1 PO4^3- ions, making 4 ions in total. Or wait, is it the other way around?

Wait, no, the formula for mean activity is a± = ( (γ_Na+) * m_Na+ )^(ν_Na+) * ( (γ_PO4) * m_PO4 )^(ν_PO4) )^(1/total ν), but since Na3PO4 is a strong electrolyte, it dissociates completely. So each mole of Na3PO4 gives 3 moles of Na+ and 1 mole of PO4^3-.

So the molality of Na+ is 3 * 0.0350 m = 0.105 m. The molality of PO4^3- is 0.0350 m.

But wait, the mean activity is calculated using the formula: a± = γ± * (m)_mean, where (m)_mean is the mean ionic molality. Oh wait, perhaps the mean ionic molality is calculated first, then multiplied by the mean activity coefficient.

Wait, the mean ionic molality (m±) is calculated by taking the sum of each ion's concentration multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficient, divided by the total number of ions.

Wait, no, the general formula is m± = ( (ν1 * m1) + (ν2 * m2) ) / (ν_total) ), but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, for each ion, you take m_i to the power of ν_i, multiply them, then take the root over the total ν.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for the mean activity coefficient. The mean activity coefficient γ± is given, and the mean ionic activity is a function of the ionic concentrations and the activity coefficients of each ion. But since the problem gives the mean activity coefficient, perhaps I can use it directly.

Hmm, I recall that the mean activity a± is equal to the activity of each ion raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients, then multiplied together and taken the appropriate root. But maybe a simpler approach is to calculate the ionic strength first, but wait, the activity coefficient is given, so perhaps that's not necessary.

Wait, another approach: the mean ionic activity is the product of each ion's activity. For each ion, activity is γ * m. But wait, no, it's the individual ion's activity, which is γ_i * m_i. But without knowing each γ, perhaps an alternative approach is needed.

Wait, wait, the mean activity coefficient is given as 0.685. So perhaps the mean ionic activity is the mean activity coefficient multiplied by the square root of the ionic strength? Or maybe it's the product of the individual ion concentrations each raised to their stoichiometric coefficients, multiplied by the activity coefficients.

Alternatively, the mean ionic activity (a±) can be calculated using the formula:

a± = ( (a_Na+)^3 * a_PO4 )^(1/4 )

But each ion's activity is γ_i * m_i. However, if we assume that the mean activity coefficient applies to each ion, then a_Na+ = γ± * m_Na+ and a_PO4 = γ± * m_PO4.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the mean activity is calculated as ( (m_Na+^3) * (m_PO4) )^(1/4) ) * γ±.

Let me try that. So, m_Na+ is 3 * 0.0350 m = 0.105 m. m_PO4 is 0.0350 m.

So the term inside the parentheses would be (0.105^3 * 0.035)^(1/4).

Let me compute that. 0.105 cubed is 0.105 * 0.105 = 0.011025, then multiplied by 0.105 gives approximately 0.001157625. Then multiply by 0.035: 0.001157625 * 0.035 ≈ 0.000040518. Then take the fourth root of that.

Wait, but wait, no, the term is ( (0.105)^3 * (0.035) )^(1/4). So that's (0.105^3 * 0.035)^(1/4). Let me calculate that.

Compute 0.105^3: 0.105 * 0.105 = 0.011025. Multiply by 0.105 again: 0.001157625.

Multiply by 0.035: 0.001157625 * 0.035 = 0.000040518.

Now take the fourth root. Hmm, the fourth root of 0.000040518.

Wait, let me convert this to exponents to compute it. 0.000040518 is 4.0518e-5.

The fourth root of 4.0518e-5 is the same as (4.0518e-5)^(1/4). Let me compute this.

Compute ln(4.0518e-5) first. ln(4.0518) is about 1.403, and ln(1e-5) is -11.5129. So ln(4.0518e-5) is approximately 1.403 -11.5129 = -10.1099.

Divide by 4: -10.1099 /4 ≈ -2.5275.

Exponentiate: e^(-2.5275) ≈ 0.0797.

So the term inside is approximately 0.0797.

But then we have to multiply by γ±, which is 0.685.

So 0.0797 * 0.685 ≈ let's compute that. 0.07 * 0.685 is 0.04795, and 0.0097*0.685 is about 0.00665. So total is around 0.0546.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 0.0547. That's very close. So perhaps that's the answer. Let me double-check my calculations to see if I made any mistakes.

Wait, let me recompute the step where I calculated (0.105^3 * 0.035)^(1/4).

0.105^3 = 0.001157625.

Multiply by 0.035: 0.001157625 * 0.035 = 0.0000405184375.

Now, the fourth root of 0.0000405184375.

Alternatively, I can compute this using logarithms.

Let me compute log10(0.0000405184375) = log10(4.05184375e-5) = log10(4.05184375) + (-5) * log10(10) → approx 0.6083 -5 = -4.3917.

Divide by 4 to get log10(x^(1/4)):

-4.3917 /4 ≈ -1.0979.

Now, 10^(-1.0979) = 10^(-1) * 10^(-0.0979) ≈ 0.1 * 0.8025 ≈ 0.08025.

So the term is approximately 0.08025. Multiply by γ± of 0.685 gives 0.08025 * 0.685 ≈ let's compute:

0.08 * 0.685 = 0.0548.

0.00025 * 0.685 = 0.00017125.

Adding them gives approximately 0.05497125, which is about 0.0550. Wait, but the option I is 0.0547, which is very close.

Wait, but perhaps I was a bit off in the initial calculations. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more precisely without approximations.

Compute 0.105^3: 0.105 * 0.105 = 0.011025. 0.011025 * 0.105 = 0.001157625.

Multiply by 0.035: 0.001157625 * 0.035 = 0.0000405184375.

Take the fourth root of 0.0000405184375. Let me compute this using a calculator approach.

Let me compute (0.0000405184375)^(1/4).

I can write this as (4.05184375 × 10^-5)^(1/4) = (4.05184375)^(1/4) × (10^-5)^(1/4).

(10^-5)^(1/4) = 10^(-5/4) = 10^(-1.25) = approx 0.05623.

Now, (4.05184375)^(1/4): let me compute that.

Well, sqrt(4.0518) is 2.0132, then sqrt(2.0132) is approx 1.419.

So 4.0518^(1/4) ≈ 1.419.

So 1.419 * 0.05623 ≈ 0.0798.

Multiply by γ± (0.685): 0.0798 * 0.685 ≈ let's compute:

0.07 * 0.685 = 0.04795.

0.0098 * 0.685 ≈ 0.006713.

Adding: 0.04795 + 0.006713 = 0.05466.

So approximately 0.0547, which matches option I.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: the mean ionic activity is given by a± = γ± * (m_ion)^(1/ν_total), where ν_total is the sum of stoichiometric coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a± = (γ±) * (m)^(ν/ν_total).

Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the product of each ion's concentration raised to their stoichiometric coefficient, all multiplied by the mean activity coefficient.

Wait, the general formula for the activity of the electrolyte in solution is a = (γ_Na+^3 * γ_PO4^3- )^(1/(3+1)) ) * (m_Na+^3 * m_PO4^3- )^(1/4).

But since γ± is the mean activity coefficient, and it's given, perhaps the activity is a = (m_Na+^3 * m_PO4^3- )^(1/4) * γ±.

So in that case, the mean activity would be ( (0.105)^3 * 0.035 )^(1/4) * 0.685.

Which is exactly what I calculated earlier, giving approximately 0.0547.

So the correct answer should be option I: 0.0547.

To calculate the mean ionic activity (\(a_\pm\)) of a \(0.0350 \, \mathrm{m} \, \mathrm{Na}_3\mathrm{PO}_4\) solution with a mean activity coefficient (\(\gamma_\pm\)) of \(0.685\), the following steps are used:

1. **Dissociation of \(\mathrm{Na}_3\mathrm{PO}_4\):**  
   \(\mathrm{Na}_3\mathrm{PO}_4 \rightarrow 3 \, \mathrm{Na}^+ + \mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}\).  
   Each mole of \(\mathrm{Na}_3\mathrm{PO}_4\) produces 3 moles of \(\mathrm{Na}^+\) and 1 mole of \(\mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}\).

2. **Molality of each ion:**  
   - Molality of \(\mathrm{Na}^+\): \(3 \times 0.0350 = 0.105 \, \mathrm{m}\).  
   - Molality of \(\mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}\): \(0.0350 \, \mathrm{m}\).

3. **Mean ionic activity formula:**  
   The mean ionic activity is given by:  
   \[
   a_\pm = \gamma_\pm \cdot \left( (\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{Na}^+})^3 \cdot (\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{PO}_4^{3-}}) \right)^{1/4}
   \]

4. **Substitute values:**  
   \[
   a_\pm = 0.685 \cdot \left( (0.105)^3 \cdot (0.035) \right)^{1/4}
   \]

5. **Calculate \((0.105)^3 \cdot (0.035)\):**  
   - \(0.105^3 = 0.001157625\).  
   - \(0.001157625 \cdot 0.035 = 0.000040518\).

6. **Take the fourth root:**  
   \[
   \left( 0.000040518 \right)^{1/4} \approx 0.0797
   \]

7. **Multiply by \(\gamma_\pm\):**  
   \[
   a_\pm = 0.685 \cdot 0.0797 \approx 0.0547
   \]

Thus, the mean ionic activity is approximately \(0.0547\), which corresponds to option **I**.
