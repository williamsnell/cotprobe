Question:

A user enters a Web address in a browser, and a request for a file is sent to a Web server. Which of the following best describes how the file is sent to the user?

Options:

A: The server attempts to connect directly to the user's computer. If the connection is successful, the entire file is sent. If the connection is unsuccessful, an error message is sent to the user.
B: The file is broken into packets for transmission. The user's browser must request each packet randomly until all packets are received.
C: The server compresses the file into a single packet for transmission. The user's browser decompresses the packet upon receipt.
D: The server repeatedly attempts to connect directly to the user's computer until a connection is made. Once the connection is made, the entire file is sent.
E: The file is broken into packets for transmission. The packets must be reassembled upon receipt.
F: The file is broken into packets for transmission. The user's browser must request each packet in order until all packets are received.
G: The server sends each packet to the user's computer, which must confirm receipt of each packet before the next one is sent.
H: The file is sent in separate sections, which are downloaded sequentially by the user's browser.
I: The server sends the file in a continuous stream to the user's browser, which buffers the stream for viewing.
J: The server sends the entire file in one large transmission to the user's browser.

Okay, so I've got this question about how a web server sends a file to a user's browser. Hmm, I remember that when you enter a web address, your browser sends a request to the server, and then the server sends the file back. But how exactly does that process work?

The question gives me ten options, from A to J. I need to figure out which one correctly describes the process.

Let me think about what I know about data transmission on the internet. I recall that data is usually broken into packets. Each packet has some data, and they're sent individually. This is because sending large files all at once isn't efficient and can lead to data loss or congestion. So the idea is to split the file into smaller chunks, send them, and then reassemble them at the destination.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: The server connects directly and sends the entire file. If it fails, sends an error. But I don't think that's right because sending the entire file at once isn't how TCP/IP works. Plus, direct connection attempts might not account for packet switching.

Option B: File is broken into packets, and browser requests each randomly. No, that doesn't sound right. Packets aren't requested randomly; they have a sequence to ensure they're assembled correctly.

Option C: Compressed into a single packet. That doesn't make sense because even if compressed, a single packet for a large file would be inefficient and likely too big for networks, which have maximum packet sizes.

Option D: Server keeps trying to connect until it does, then sends the entire file. Again, this seems like it's talking about a direct connection and sending the whole file, which isn't how it's done.

Option E: File broken into packets and reassembled upon receipt. This sounds familiar. Packets are sent, and the receiver puts them back together. I think this is part of the TCP protocol.

Option F: Packets are sent, and browser must request each in order. So maybe the browser requests each packet in sequence. But I'm not sure if the browser requests each packet. I think the packets are sent without the browser having to request each one, except maybe in cases of lost packets.

Option G: Server sends each packet, and the user's computer confirms receipt before the next is sent. This sounds like the concept of acknowledgments in TCP. Each packet is sent, and upon receipt, the receiver sends an ACK. If it doesn't get an ACK, it resends the packet. So this could be correct, but does it describe the entire process?

Option H: Sent in sections, downloaded sequentially. This is a bit vague. I think it's similar to streaming, but I'm not sure. Maybe like downloading parts one after another, but the question is about how the file is sent, not how it's displayed.

Option I: Sent in a continuous stream, buffered for viewing. That might be more like video streaming, where the data is buffered as it comes in. But for a file download, it's usually packets being sent and reassembled.

Option J: Entire file sent in one transmission. No, that's not efficient and not how it's done.

So narrowing it down. The key points are that files are broken into packets. So options E, F, G, H, I involve packets or sections.

Option E says the file is broken into packets and reassembled upon receipt. That aligns with what I know about TCP. The server sends packets, each with a sequence number, and the client (browser) puts them in order.

Option G says each packet is sent, and the user's computer must confirm before the next is sent. That's part of the processâ€”ACK packets. But does it describe the entire sending process? Because the server sends packets and may wait for ACKs, but if multiple packets can be sent before an ACK is received (like with a window), then it's a bit more complex.

The question is asking which option best describes how the file is sent. So E is about breaking into packets and reassembling. G is about the acknowledgment part. So which is a better fit?

The question is about the overall process. So the fact that packets are broken and reassembled is a key point, which is option E. But I also remember that when a file is sent via TCP, it's broken into packets, each sent, and the receiver acknowledges each. So maybe G is also a correct mechanism.

Wait, the question is about how the file is sent. So E says the packets are reassembled upon receipt, which is correct. G talks about the receipt confirmation, which is part of the reliable transmission but perhaps not the main point of how the file is sent.

Alternatively, another thought: the correct answer might be E because it's about packetization and reassembly, which is fundamental. G describes the error checking mechanism but perhaps doesn't capture the overall process.

Wait, the options: E says the file is broken into packets and must be reassembled upon receipt. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, let's think about how HTTP and TCP work. When a user requests a file, the server breaks the file into packets. Each packet is sent over the network, possibly taking different routes. The client's browser collects all the packets and reassembles them into the original file.

So the correct process would involve breaking into packets and reassembling, which is option E.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option E says the packets must be reassembled upon receipt. That's exactly what happens.

Option G describes a stop-and-wait method, where each packet is acknowledged before the next is sent. But in reality, TCP uses a sliding window for better efficiency, allowing multiple packets to be sent before an ACK is received. So G's description isn't the best fit.

Therefore, the best option is E.

When a user enters a web address, the browser sends a request to the server, and the server responds by sending the requested file. The file is not sent as a single transmission but is instead broken into smaller packets. This is because sending large files in one go is inefficient and prone to data loss. Each packet is transmitted separately, and upon receipt, the client (browser) reassembles these packets into the original file. This process is a fundamental aspect of how data is transmitted over the internet, particularly using the TCP protocol, which ensures reliable data transfer.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, D, J**: These describe sending the entire file at once, which is not how data is transmitted over the internet due to inefficiency and potential data loss.
- **B, F**: These suggest that the browser requests packets randomly or in order, which is inaccurate. Packets are sent without the browser needing to request each one individually.
- **C**: Compressing the file into a single packet is impractical, as large files would exceed network packet size limits.
- **G**: While TCP does use acknowledgments (ACKs) to confirm packet receipt, this describes a specific mechanism (stop-and-wait) rather than the overall process of how the file is sent.
- **H, I**: These describe sequential downloading or streaming, which are not the standard method for file transmission.
- **E**: This correctly describes the process of breaking the file into packets and reassembling them upon receipt, which aligns with how TCP operates.

The best description of how the file is sent is that it is broken into packets and reassembled upon receipt.
