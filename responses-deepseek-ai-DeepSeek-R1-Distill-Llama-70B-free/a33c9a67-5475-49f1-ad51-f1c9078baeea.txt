Okay, so I have this problem here about Mrs. Batter and her earnings from the Colonial Cookie Company. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the problem says they pay on a piece-rate basis at 80 cents per piece. So, for each cookie or piece she makes, she gets $0.80. Got it. Now, I need to calculate her total earnings for the week. 

Looking at the numbers, she worked five days: Monday to Friday. The number of acceptable pieces each day are as follows: Monday 45, Tuesday 41, Wednesday 49, Thursday 47, and Friday 43. So I need to add all these up first to find the total number of pieces she made during the week. 

Let me write them down: 45, 41, 49, 47, 43. Hmm, adding these together. Let me do it step by step to avoid mistakes. 

Starting with Monday and Tuesday: 45 + 41. That's 86. Then add Wednesday's 49. 86 +49 is 135. Next, add Thursday's 47. 135 +47 equals 182. Finally, add Friday's 43. 182 +43 is 225. So the total number of pieces is 225.

Now, each piece pays 80 cents. So her total earnings would be 225 pieces multiplied by $0.80 per piece. Let me calculate that. 

225 times 0.8. Hmm, I can think of it as 200 *0.8 plus 25 *0.8. 200 *0.8 is 160, and 25*0.8 is 20. So 160 +20 is 180. So her earnings should be $180.

Looking at the options, option J is $180. So the correct answer should be J.

The total number of pieces Mrs. Batter completed is calculated by adding the daily pieces: 45 + 41 + 49 + 47 + 43 = 225. At a rate of $0.80 per piece, her earnings are 225 Ã— 0.80 = $180. 

The correct answer is J: $180.
