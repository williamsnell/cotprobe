Question:

The Self-Concept is the individualâ€™s belief about their own attributes. What can happen according to the OVERJUSTIFICATION HYPOTHESIS?

Options:

A: to experience an emotion, a person must first experience cognitive interpretation, then physiological arousal
B: not rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest
C: not rewarding people for an unenjoyable activity can enhance their interest
D: when internal cues are clear, people infer by observing their behavior and the situational context
E: rewarding people for an unenjoyable activity can enhance their interest
F: to experience an emotion, a person must first experience physiological arousal, then a cognitive interpretation of that arousal
G: when internal cues are vague, people infer by observing their behavior and the situational context
H: rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest
I: when external cues are vague, people infer by observing their behavior and the situational context
J: rewarding people excessively can enhance their interest

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the overjustification hypothesis and its relation to self-concept. Hmm, I need to think through this carefully. Let me start by recalling what the overjustification hypothesis actually says.

From what I remember in my psychology classes, the overjustification hypothesis is related to intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The basic idea is that when people are rewarded for doing something they already enjoy, it might actually reduce their intrinsic motivation. Because if you start giving rewards for something they find naturally rewarding, they might start attributing their motivation to the reward rather than their own interest. So, the person might think they're doing the activity for the reward instead of because they like it. This can lead to a decrease in their interest in the activity when the rewards stop coming.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A talks about emotions requiring cognitive interpretation before physiological arousal. That sounds more like the cognitive theory of emotions, like the two-factor theory maybe? Not directly related to overjustification.

Option B says not rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest. Wait, no. If you don't reward them, but they already enjoy it, their interest would stay the same or maybe increase. The overjustification effect is about when you do reward something they already like, which then reduces interest. So this might not be correct.

Option C suggests not rewarding an unenjoyable activity can enhance interest. That doesn't make much sense. If someone doesn't enjoy it and you don't reward them, why would their interest go up? I don't think this is right.

Option D: When internal cues are clear, people infer through their behavior and context. This sounds like self-perception theory. When you have clear internal cues, you might not need to observe your behavior to know how you feel. But I'm not sure how this ties into the question about overjustification.

Option E: Rewarding an unenjoyable activity can enhance interest. Wait, that seems plausible. If someone doesn't like an activity, giving a reward might make them do it more, but does it enhance their intrinsic interest? Or does it just make them do it for the reward? I think overjustification is more about when you add extrinsic rewards to an already intrinsically rewarding activity, which then undermines the intrinsic motivation. So E might be about something else, maybe the opposite effect. Like, rewards can increase interest in unenjoyable tasks, but that's not overjustification.

Option F: Emotion requires physiological arousal first, then cognitive interpretation. That's the James-Lange theory, right? So not related here.

Option G: When internal cues are vague, people observe their behavior and context to infer their feelings. This is definitely self-perception theory again. It's about how people figure out their own emotions by looking at their actions and the situation. Again, not directly related to overjustification.

Option H: Rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest. Oh wait, this aligns with what I was thinking earlier. So if someone is doing something they enjoy (intrinsic motivation), and you start rewarding them, they might start thinking they're doing it for the reward instead. So their intrinsic motivation decreases because the extrinsic reward undermines it. That's the overjustification hypothesis in action. So this seems like the correct answer.

Option I: When external cues are vague, people infer by observing their behavior. Not sure, but this seems more about social cognition or maybe again self-perception. Not related to the question.

Option J: Rewarding people excessively can enhance their interest. That doesn't sound right. Overjustification is about undermining interest when you add rewards where intrinsic motivation exists. So excessive rewarding might have other effects, but not enhancing interest in the context of overjustification.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be H. Rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest because it introduces an extrinsic reward where intrinsic motivation was already present, leading to a decrease in that intrinsic interest.

The overjustification hypothesis explains that when individuals are rewarded for an activity they already find enjoyable, their intrinsic motivation for that activity can decrease. This occurs because they begin to attribute their motivation to the extrinsic reward rather than their genuine interest. Analyzing the options:

- **A, F**: These pertain to emotion theories (cognitive and James-Lange) and are unrelated to the overjustification hypothesis.
- **B**: Suggests that not rewarding an enjoyable activity undermines interest, which contradicts the hypothesis since intrinsic motivation typically persists without rewards.
- **C**: Implies that not rewarding an unenjoyable activity enhances interest, which is illogical and unrelated to the hypothesis.
- **D, G, I**: These relate to self-perception theory, not the overjustification hypothesis.
- **E**: Suggests that rewarding an unenjoyable activity enhances interest, which is plausible but unrelated to the hypothesis, as it focuses on intrinsic motivation.
- **H**: Correctly states that rewarding an enjoyable activity can undermine interest, aligning with the overjustification hypothesis.
- **J**: Suggests excessive rewards enhance interest, which contradicts the hypothesis.

The correct answer is **H**, as it directly reflects the overjustification hypothesis. 

Answer: H
