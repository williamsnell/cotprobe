Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the major result of breastfeeding an infant. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what research suggests is the major outcome of breastfeeding. The options are from A to J. Let me go through each option one by one and see which one makes the most sense.

Option A says stronger infant immunity based solely on the duration. I know breast milk has antibodies that help with immunity, but I'm not sure if it's solely based on how long you breastfeed. Maybe it's more about the presence of these antibodies rather than just the duration.

Option B is about the specific method used in feeding. That seems more about the technique, like latching, which I don't think is the major result. It's probably more about the effects on the baby rather than the method itself.

Option C mentions the attitude of parents during feeding. While the bonding during feeding is important, I'm not sure if that's the major result highlighted by research. It might be a benefit, but perhaps not the main one.

Option D talks about predictable sleep patterns. I've heard that breastfed babies might have different sleep patterns, but I don't recall this being the major result. It could be a side effect, but not the primary outcome.

Option E suggests enhanced cognitive development due to nutrients. I remember reading that breastfed babies may have better cognitive scores, possibly because of the fatty acids in breast milk. But the option says "exclusively due to nutrient composition." I'm not certain if it's the only factor or if other aspects like mother-infant interaction play a role too.

Option F is oral stimulation and eating. That's a bit vague. I know that breastfeeding does involve oral stimulation, which is important for development, but I'm not sure if that's the major result research points to.

Option G says long-term taste preferences based on breast milk variety. I think breast milk's flavor varies depending on the mother's diet, which might influence the baby's taste preferences later. That's an interesting point, but is this the major result? I'm not sure.

Option H talks about a more diverse palate by age one. This seems related to option G, but again, I'm not certain if this is the main outcome studied.

Option I is about intimate contact with the mother. Breastfeeding definitely promotes skin-to-skin contact and bonding. I've read that this physical closeness can have various emotional and developmental benefits for the infant. This sounds like a significant outcome.

Option J mentions increased physical growth compared to formula-fed infants. I think there's some evidence that breastfed babies may have different growth patterns, but I'm not sure if it's a major result. Maybe in terms of weight or height, but I'm not certain.

Now, thinking about what I know: breastfeeding is often associated with several benefits, including immune support, cognitive development, and emotional bonding. The question is about the major result, which implies the most significant or widely recognized outcome.

Intimate contact (option I) seems like a key aspect because the physical closeness during breastfeeding is crucial for the infant's emotional development and attachment. It's not just about the milk but the interaction between the mother and baby.

On the other hand, option E's focus on cognitive development is also a strong contender. But I'm not sure if the question is pointing towards the physical or emotional benefits.

Wait, the question is about the major result. I've heard that the skin-to-skin contact and the bonding during breastfeeding have long-term effects on the child's emotional well-being and attachment styles. This could be considered a major result.

So putting it all together, I think the answer is option I: intimate contact with the mother.

The major result of breastfeeding an infant, as suggested by research, is the promotion of intimate contact with the mother. This physical closeness during feeding contributes significantly to the infant's emotional development and attachment, which are considered crucial outcomes.

Answer: I
