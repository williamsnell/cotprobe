Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Spitz's 1945 study on sensory deprivation in a social setting and what his findings suggest. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Spitz was a psychoanalyst who studied child development, particularly focusing on the effects of deprivation. I think his work was related to how the absence of certain stimuli affects children's emotional and psychological growth.

So the question is about sensory deprivation in a social context. Sensory deprivation usually refers to the absence of stimuli that we normally experience through our senses. In a social setting, this might mean lack of interaction, like not seeing or hearing people, which could be a form of social isolation.

Wait, but Spitz's study specifically—I think he looked at infants who were deprived of social interaction. Oh right, he did a study where he observed infants in orphanages who didn't receive much attention or stimulation. These babies were fed and had their basic needs met, but they didn't get the social interaction that's typical for infants. 

What were the results of that study? From what I remember, those infants developed something called "anaclitic depression." They became withdrawn, stopped smiling, and some even stopped growing physically. This suggested that the lack of social stimulation was really harmful to their development.

So the question is about what Spitz's findings suggest. The options are from A to J. Let me go through them.

Option A: Social deprivation has no significant impact on emotional growth. No, that's the opposite of what Spitz found. He showed it does have a significant impact.

Option B: Sensory and social deprivation enhance development. That doesn't sound right. Deprivation would hinder, not enhance.

Option C: Sensory deprivation can improve problem-solving abilities. I don't recall any findings about improved abilities. It was more about negative effects.

Option D: Spitz's study suggests social deprivation leads to accelerated cognitive development. No, I think it was the opposite—the children's development slowed or was impaired.

Option E: Only affects physical growth. No, because Spitz noted emotional and psychological effects, like withdrawal and depression.

Option F: Only affects language development. Again, that's too narrow. The effects were broader, including emotional well-being.

Option G: Beneficial for short periods. I don't think so. Even short periods might be harmful, but the study likely showed negative effects regardless.

Option H: No effect on development. Definitely not, as the children were negatively impacted.

Option I: Sensory and social deprivation can adversely affect normal development. Yes, this aligns with what I remember. The deprivation caused problems in emotional and physical growth.

Option J: Improves social skills later. No, the opposite. The children had issues with social development because of the lack of early interaction.

So the correct answer should be I: Sensory and social deprivation can adversely affect normal development.

The correct answer is I. Spitz's study demonstrated that sensory and social deprivation can have detrimental effects on normal development, including emotional and physical growth.
