The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Statement 1| A U2F USB dongle prevents malware on the user’s computer from stealing the user’s second factor to authenticate as that user even when the user’s computer is turned off.

Options:

A: False, True
B: True, True
C: False, False
D: Both statements are partially true
E: False, Not enough information
F: Not enough information, Not enough information
G: True, False
H: True, Not enough information
I: Not enough information, True
J: Not enough information, False

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about U2F USB dongles and their security features. The question presents two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false.

First, let me understand what a U2F dongle is. From what I remember, U2F stands for Universal 2nd Factor. It's a type of security token used for two-factor authentication. These are usually small USB devices that you plug into your computer when logging into a service that supports U2F.

Statement 1 says: "A U2F USB dongle prevents malware on the user’s computer from stealing the user’s second factor to authenticate as that user even when the user’s computer is turned off."

Hmm, wait. So the idea is that the dongle stops malware from stealing the second factor. I think the second factor here refers to the U2F token's response. When you log in, the server sends a challenge, and the U2F token generates a response. But how does the dongle prevent malware from stealing this?

I remember that U2F tokens use public-key cryptography. The token has a private key, and the server has the corresponding public key. When authenticating, the token signs the challenge with its private key, which the server verifies using the public key. So the private key never leaves the token. Therefore, even if malware is on the computer, it can't get the private key because it's stored securely on the dongle.

But wait, the statement says "even when the user’s computer is turned off." That part is confusing. If the computer is off, the dongle isn't plugged in, right? So maybe the statement is referring to when the computer is on but infected with malware. Oh, I think I get it. The point is that even if the computer is infected, the malware can't steal the second factor because it's on the dongle. So Statement 1 would be true because the dongle prevents the theft of the second factor.

Now, Statement 2: "A server using U2F can reliably determine that the user who is attempting to login is indeed behind the computer that sent the login request."

How does this work? U2F is a second factor, so the server knows that the correct token was used. But does it ensure that the user themselves is present? I think it ensures that the token was used, but maybe it doesn't confirm the user's presence, like a biometric would. For example, someone could steal the U2F token and use it without the user's knowledge. So, if the token is used, the server knows it's the correct token, but not necessarily that the user is the one holding it. Unless there's some other factor, like a PIN required for the token, which isn't specified here.

Wait, but the question is about the server's ability to determine if the user is behind the computer. U2F doesn't provide information about the user's identity beyond the token's presence. So the server can't reliably confirm the user's presence, only that the correct token was used. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Looking at the options, option G is "True, False." So the answer should be G.

The U2F USB dongle uses public-key cryptography, ensuring the private key remains secure on the device. This prevents malware from stealing the second factor, making Statement 1 true. However, U2F doesn't confirm the user's presence, only the token's use, so Statement 2 is false.

Answer: G
