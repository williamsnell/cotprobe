Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about frameshift mutations. Hmm, I remember that frameshift mutations involve insertions or deletions of nucleotides that change the reading frame of the genetic code. The key point is that the number of added or deleted nucleotides isn't a multiple of three, which throws off the triplet codon reading frame from the point where the mutation occurs.

The question gives six options, each showing a change in a sentence. I think each word represents a codon, since they're all three letters. So the original is "CAT HAS HIS". Let's look at each option.

Option A: CAT HAS HIS → CAT HIS HAT. Wait, let me compare. The original is CAT HAS HIS. The mutated is CAT HIS HAT. So the words after CAT have changed. So HAS became HIS and HIS became HAT? Or maybe the letters shifted. Let me write the letters in a row. Original: C A T H A S H I S. Mutated: C A T H I S H A T. Wait, maybe a letter was inserted or deleted. Let me see: the original is 9 letters (CAT HAS HIS is 3 words, 3 letters each, so 3x3=9 letters). The mutated version is also 9 letters, because CAT HIS HAT is also 3x3. So that's same length, so maybe it's a substitution, not a frameshift. So probably not a frameshift.

Option B: CAT HAS HIS → CAT HATH IS. Let me check the letters. Original is 9 letters. After mutation, the words are CAT HATH IS. HATH is four letters, which is a problem because each word should be three letters if they're codons. So that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the letters are run together. Wait, the original is CAT HAS HIS → C A T H A S H I S. The mutated is C A T H A T H I S. Wait, that's 10 letters. Because HATH is four letters (H A T H?), but the original was H A S. So maybe a T was inserted in there. Let me see: the original after CAT is HAS (H A S), then HIS (H I S). The mutated version after CAT is HATH (H A T H?), but that's four letters, which would add one more letter. So the total letters would be 3 (CAT) +4 (HATH) + 2 (IS) = 9 letters? No, wait, CAT is 3, HATH is 4, IS is 2, that's 9. Wait, but the original was 9, so adding a letter would make it 10. Hmm, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps a single nucleotide was inserted, causing a shift.

Wait, another approach: in a frameshift, the reading frame shifts. So the way to check is to see if the number of letters added or removed isn't a multiple of three. Let's look at each option's change.

Option B: Original is CAT HAS HIS → letters C A T H A S H I S. Mutated is CAT HATH IS → C A T H A T H I S. So the original sequence after CAT is H A S H I S. The mutated is H A T H I S. Wait, did a T replace the S in HAS? Or maybe an insertion. Let's see:

Original: positions 4-9: H A S H I S.

Mutated: positions 4-9: H A T H I S.

Wait, so position 6 was S, now it's T. So that's a single substitution, not a frameshift. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the S was replaced by T and H was inserted. Hmm, not sure. But the total letters: original is 9, mutated remains 9, so no net insertion or deletion. So this can't be a frameshift. Because frameshift requires insert or delete of nucleotides, which changes the length, but here length remains same. So B is not a frameshift.

Option C: CAT HAS HIS → CAT WAS HIT. Let's look. Original: CAT HAS HIS → C A T H A S H I S. After mutation: CAT WAS HIT → C A T W A S H I T. So the letters after CAT are W A S H I T. So perhaps the H A S became W A S, and then H I S became H I T. But again, the length is the same (9 letters), so substitution, not frameshift.

Option D: CAT HAS HIS → CAT HSH ISA. Let me write the letters. Original: C A T H A S H I S → 9 letters. Mutated: C A T H S H I S A. So the letters after CAT are H S H I S A. Wait, let's count letters in mutated: CAT is 3, HSH is 3, ISA is 3. So 3+3+3=9. So same length as original. What's the difference? Let me write the original as a continuous string: CATHASHIS. Mutated: CATHSHISA. Wait, comparing:

Original: C A T H A S H I S → positions 4-6: H A S; 7-9: H I S.

Mutated: C A T H S H I S A → positions 4-6: H S H; 7-9: I S A.

So looking for insertions or deletions. Hmm, perhaps a single letter was inserted or deleted. Let me see: original letters after CAT are H A S H I S. Mutated has H S H I S A. Let's count the letters after CAT in mutated: H S H I S A → that's 6 letters, but original after CAT is 6 letters as well. So same length, but rearranged. So perhaps a substitution, or maybe a shift.

Wait, maybe in mutated, the letters are H S H I S A. Comparing to original H A S H I S. Let me see: perhaps the A and S were swapped? Or perhaps a couple substitutions. But since the length is the same, it's not a frameshift. So D is not a frameshift.

Option E: CAT HAS HIS → CAT SAW HIS. So letters after CAT are S A W H I S. So letters: S A W H I S. Original was H A S H I S. So again, same length. So substitution, not frameshift.

Option F: CAT HAS HIS → CAT HAS HIS CAT. So the original is 9 letters, the mutated is 12 letters because it's CAT HAS HIS CAT (3+3+3+3=12). So an insertion of 3 letters (CAT) at the end. Since 3 is a multiple of three, this is an in-frame insertion, so not a frameshift. Frameshift requires insert/delete of nucleotides not in multiples of three. So F is not a frameshift.

Wait, but let me go back to option B. Because earlier I was confused. Option B: CAT HAS HIS → CAT HATH IS. Let me write the letters without spaces.

Original: C A T H A S H I S → 9 letters.

Mutated: C A T H A T H I S → 9 letters? Wait, HATH is four letters, but in the option, it's written as HATH IS. So HATH is four letters, IS is two. So total letters: 3 (CAT) +4 (HATH) +2 (IS) = 9 letters. So same length as original.

So it can't be a frameshift because frameshift requires a change in the number of nucleotides that's not a multiple of three. So all options except perhaps one involve same number of letters, except maybe option D? Wait, no, all options have same letters except F, which adds three letters (a multiple of three, so not frameshift).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine each option for insertions or deletions that change the total length by 1 or 2.

Looking again:

Option A: same number of letters, 9 each. So substitution.

Option B: same as original, 9 letters. So substitution.

Option C: same letters, substitution.

Option D: same letters, substitution.

Option E: same letters, substitution.

Option F: 12 letters, so 3 added. But 3 is multiple of three, so not frameshift.

Wait, so none of the options except maybe option B or D have a change in letter count. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should write each option as a continuous string and see if the letters after a point shift.

Let's take the original as C A T H A S H I S.

Option B: CAT HATH IS → C A T H A T H I S. So letters after CAT are H A T H I S. Original after CAT is H A S H I S. So comparing:

Original: H A S H I S

Mutated: H A T H I S

So at position 4-6: original is H A S; mutated is H A T. So the S was replaced by T. Then positions 7-9: original is H I S; mutated is H I S. So only a substitution at position 6. So no frameshift.

Option D: CAT HSH ISA → letters after CAT are H S H I S A. So letters: H S H I S A. Original after CAT is H A S H I S.

Comparing:

Original: H A S H I S.

Mutated: H S H I S A.

So let's write them aligned:

Original: H A S H I S → positions 4-9: 4:H,5:A,6:S,7:H,8:I,9:S.

Mutated: H S H I S A → 4:H,5:S,6:H,7:I,8:S,9:A.

Wait, so it looks like after position 4 (H), the next letters are S H I S A. So perhaps a deletion occurred. Let's see: original is H A S H I S.

Mutated is H S H I S A.

Wait, maybe comparing each position:

Position 4: H (same)
Position 5: A vs S → change
Position 6: S vs H → change
Position 7: H vs I → change
Position 8: I vs S → change
Position 9: S vs A → change.

Hmm, so the letters from position 5 onward are all different. It's as if at position 5, a S is inserted, shifting the rest. Alternatively, perhaps a single base was inserted after position 4, causing a shift.

Wait, let me write the original as a continuous string: CATHASHIS.

Mutated D: CATHSHISA.

Let me write both:

Original: C A T H A S H I S.

Mutated D: C A T H S H I S A.

Wait, the mutated version has an extra S after the H, making it H S H I S A. So original was H A S H I S (positions 4-9: H A S H I S).

Mutated is H S H I S A. So comparing each position:

4: H same.

5: A → S.

6: S → H.

7: H → I.

8: I → S.

9: S → A.

So it's like after position 4, each position shifts. That suggests that a single nucleotide was inserted after position 4 (H). Let's see:

Original: H (4) A (5) S (6) H (7) I (8) S (9).

Mutated: H (4) S (5) H (6) I (7) S (8) A (9).

Wait, that's not making sense. Alternatively, perhaps a deletion occurred. Let me think: the original is H A S H I S.

Mutated is H S H I S A.

Wait, maybe a single base was deleted from the original, causing the shift.

Original: H A S H I S → 6 letters.

Mutated: H S H I S A → perhaps the 'A' was deleted, and a new 'S' inserted? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the original is:

CAT H A S H I S → so letters 4-9: H A S H I S.

Mutated D is CAT H S H I S A → letters 4-9: H S H I S A.

Wait, that's 6 letters in D as well. So same length. So perhaps a substitution, not a frameshift.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again about what a frameshift would look like in these options.

A frameshift mutation would involve the insertion or deletion of nucleotides in numbers not divisible by three. So for instance, inserting one or two nucleotides would shift the reading frame from that point onward.

Looking at the options, all except F have the same number of letters (9). But F adds three letters, so that's not a frameshift. So perhaps none of the options are frameshifts. But that's not possible since the question states that one is.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the letters. Let me re-examine each option.

Option B: CAT HATH IS → let's count letters.

Original: CAT (3) HAS (3) HIS (3) → 9 letters.

Mutated: CAT (3) HATH (4?) → Wait, no, the mutated option is written as CAT HATH IS. So HATH is four letters, and IS is two. So 3 +4 +2 =9 letters. But how? Because HATH is four letters. So perhaps the letters are run as CAT HATHIS, making it 3 + 6 letters? Or maybe the option is a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation in option B is adding a T, making HATH from HAS. So the original after CAT is HAS HIS → H A S H I S.

After mutation, it's HATH IS → H A T H I S.

Wait, now I'm getting more confused. Let me write it as a continuous string.

Original: C A T H A S H I S → 9 letters.

Option B: C A T H A T H I S → 9 letters.

Wait, so the 6th letter (originally S) is now T. So a substitution at position 6: S → T. That's a point mutation, not a frameshift.

Hmm, so again, same length, so not a frameshift.

Wait, could any of the options involve a change in length not a multiple of three? Let me check.

Option D: after CAT, the letters are HSH ISA. Let's write letters as CAT HSH ISA → C A T H S H I S A → 10 letters? Because after CAT (3), HSH is 3, ISA is 3. 3+3+3=9. So same as original.

Wait, perhaps in option D, an extra letter is inserted. Let me see:

Original: CAT HAS HIS → 3 +3 +3 =9.

Mutated: CAT HSH ISA → 3 +3 +3=9.

Wait, same length. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think in terms of the mRNA sequence.

Frameshift occurs when the reading frame shifts because the number of inserted or deleted nucleotides is not a multiple of three. So, for example, inserting one nucleotide would shift the frame from that point, changing all subsequent codons.

Looking at the options, perhaps option B or D have such a shift, but I can't tell yet.

Wait, let me consider each option as a continuous string and check the length.

Option B: CAT HATH IS → CAT HATH IS → letters: C A T H A T H I S → 9 letters, same as original.

Option D: CAT HSH ISA → C A T H S H I S A → 10 letters. Wait, that's 10 letters. Because after CAT (3), HSH (3), ISA (3) → 3+3+3=9. Wait, no, wait: HSH is 3 letters, ISA is 3, so 3+3+3=9. So same as original.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me write each option's string.

Option A:

Original: CAT HAS HIS → C A T H A S H I S → 9 letters.

Mutated: CAT HIS HAT → C A T H I S H A T → 9 letters.

No change in length.

Option B:

Mutated: CAT HATH IS → C A T H A T H I S → 9 letters.

Same length.

Option C:

Mutated: CAT WAS HIT → C A T W A S H I T → 9 letters.

Same.

Option D:

Mutated: CAT HSH ISA → C A T H S H I S A → 10 letters? Because HSH is H S H, which is 3 letters, then ISA is I S A, 3 letters, so after CAT (3), total 3+3+3=9. So 9 letters.

Wait, no. Original: 3+3+3=9.

Option D: 3 (CAT) +3 (HSH) +3 (ISA) → 9 letters.

So same length.

Option E:

Mutated: CAT SAW HIS → C A T S A W H I S → 9 letters.

Same.

Option F: adds 3 letters, so same frame.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing an option where the letter count changes by 1 or 2. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the way the options are written, the number of words changes, implying a change in letters.

For example, option B: from three words (CAT HAS HIS) to two words (CAT HATH IS). So letters would be 3 +4 +2=9 letters. So same length.

Option D: from three words to three words (CAT HSH ISA), same length.

Wait, maybe none of the options are a frameshift. But the question states that one is, so I must have missed something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of how the codons are read. A frameshift would cause the codons to be read differently from the point of mutation onwards.

Let me consider option B: CAT HATH IS.

Original: CAT HAS HIS → codons are CAT, HAS, HIS.

Mutated: CAT, HAT, HIS? Or is it CAT, HATH, IS? Because the way it's written, HATH is four letters, so that's a problem. So the reading frame would shift after CAT.

Alternatively, let me write the mutated as a continuous string without spaces: C A T H A T H I S. So the codons would be CAT, HAT, HIS. So that's same as the original except the second codon is HAT instead of HAS. So a substitution, not a frameshift.

Option D: mutated string is
