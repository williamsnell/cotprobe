Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the normality of a sulfuric acid solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

So the problem says: We have 2.45 grams of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) dissolved in 2.00 liters of solution. The molecular weight is given as 98.1 g/mol. I need to find the normality of this solution, and choose the correct option from A to J.

Wait, right, normality is related to equivalents. I remember that molarity is moles per liter, and normality is equivalents per liter. For acids and bases, the equivalent depends on how they react. Sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid, right? It can donate two protons, so each mole of H2SO4 can produce two equivalents.

So the steps I think are:

1. Calculate the number of moles of H2SO4 using the mass and molar mass.
2. Convert moles to equivalents, considering that each mole gives two equivalents because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid.
3. Divide by the volume in liters to get equivalents per liter (normality).

Alright, let's get into the calculations.

First, mass of H2SO4 is 2.45 grams. Molar mass is 98.1 g/mol. Moles = mass / molar mass.

So moles = 2.45 g / 98.1 g/mol. Let me compute that. Let's see, 2.45 divided by 98.1. Hmm, 98.1 is about 100, so 2.45/100 is 0.0245. But since 98.1 is a bit less than 100, the actual value will be a little higher. Let me calculate more accurately.

98.1 times 0.025 is approximately 2.4525. Oh wait, that's almost exactly the mass we have. So 2.45 grams would be roughly 0.025 moles. Wait, let me check: 98.1 * 0.025 = 2.4525. Oh, but the mass is 2.45, which is just a tiny bit less than that. So maybe 0.025 minus a little. Alternatively, perhaps it's exactly 0.025 because maybe I'm supposed to approximate here.

Wait, but let me do it more precisely. 2.45 / 98.1. Let's see, 98.1 times 0.025 is 2.4525, which is 0.0025 grams more than 2.45. So 0.025 - (0.0025 / 98.1). Wait, 0.0025 g is how much in moles? 0.0025 /98.1 ≈ 0.0000255 mol. So the actual moles would be approximately 0.025 - 0.0000255 ≈ 0.02497, which is about 0.025 mol. So for practical purposes, I can take it as 0.025 moles.

Next, since each mole of H2SO4 gives two equivalents, the equivalents would be 0.025 * 2 = 0.05 equivalents.

Wait, no. Wait, the solution is 2.00 liters. So the normality is equivalents per liter, so I divide by 2 liters.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the calculation is:

Moles of H2SO4 = 2.45 g /98.1 g/mol ≈ 0.025 mol.

Each mole gives 2 equivalents, so equivalents = 0.025 * 2 = 0.05 equivalents.

Then, the solution volume is 2.00 liters. So normality is equivalents divided by liters: 0.05 / 2.00 = 0.025 equivalents per liter.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the options don't have 0.025 as an option. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.025 equiv/liter. Hmm. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have made an error.

Wait, let's redo the calculations more accurately.

Mass = 2.45 grams.

Molar mass of H2SO4 is 98.1 g/mol.

Moles = 2.45 /98.1 = let's compute this exactly.

98.1 * 0.025 = 2.4525. So 2.45 is 0.0025 grams less than that. So 2.45 is (0.025 - (0.0025/98.1)) mol.

But 0.0025 /98.1 is approximately 0.0000255 mol. So 0.025 - 0.0000255 = approximately 0.02497 mol, which is approximately 0.025 mol. So that's okay.

So moles = 0.025 mol.

Since H2SO4 is diprotic, each mole contributes 2 equivalents. So equivalents = 0.025 * 2 = 0.05 equivalents.

Now, the volume is 2.00 liters, so normality is 0.05 / 2.00 = 0.025 N.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.025 equiv/liter. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think: Normality (N) = Molarity (M) × n, where n is the number of equivalents per formula unit. So M is 0.025 / 2 liters? Wait no, wait, Molarity is moles per liter.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me correct that. Molarity is moles of solute per liter of solution. So moles is 0.025 (from 2.45g /98.1 g/mol), and volume is 2.00 liters. So Molarity is 0.025 / 2.00 = 0.0125 M.

But since H2SO4 is diprotic, normality is 0.0125 M × 2 = 0.025 N.

Yes, that's the same as before. So the normality is 0.025, which is option F.

To calculate the normality of the sulfuric acid solution, we follow these steps:

1. **Determine the moles of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\):**  
   The mass of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) is 2.45 g, and its molar mass is 98.1 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H}_2\text{SO}_4 = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{2.45}{98.1} \approx 0.025 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Convert moles to equivalents:**  
   Sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid, meaning each mole of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) can donate 2 protons. Therefore, the number of equivalents is:  
   \[
   \text{Equivalents} = \text{Moles} \times 2 = 0.025 \times 2 = 0.05 \, \text{equiv}.
   \]

3. **Calculate normality:**  
   Normality is defined as equivalents per liter of solution. The solution volume is 2.00 liters.  
   \[
   \text{Normality} = \frac{\text{Equivalents}}{\text{Volume (L)}} = \frac{0.05}{2.00} = 0.025 \, \text{equiv/liter}.
   \]

4. **Match with the options:**  
   The calculated normality is 0.025 equiv/liter, which corresponds to **option F**.
