Okay, so I've got this question about which organ has the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass. Hmm, I remember that different organs use varying amounts of energy. Let me think.

I think the brain uses a lot of energy relative to its size. Like, I've heard it's about 20% of the body's energy use while being only a small portion of body weight. So F is probably high, not the lowest.

The heart is a muscle that works all the time, so it must use a lot. B is Heart, so probably high expenditure.

The liver does a lot of metabolic work, detoxifying and such. E: Liver would be up there too.

The kidneys are also pretty active, filtering blood all the time. D: Kidney, high energy.

Lungs expand and contract a lot, but I'm not sure about their energy use. C: Lungs might not be the lowest.

Intestines, A: They move food and absorb nutrients. That requires some energy, maybe not the highest but not the lowest either.

Stomach, G: It churns food and uses digestive enzymes. Maybe moderate.

Pancreas, J: It secretes enzymes and hormones. Maybe not the highest, but I'm not certain.

Skin, H: It's the largest organ, but what's its energy use? I think skin's main role is protection and regulating temperature. At rest, maybe it doesn't use as much energy compared to organs like the liver or brain. But I'm not sure if it's the absolute lowest.

Skeletal muscle, I: Muscles use a lot of energy when active, but at rest, maybe they don't. Wait, the question is per unit mass. So even if a muscle is big, if it's not active, maybe it's low. But when not moving, like at rest, their energy expenditure decreases. But I'm not sure how that compares to other organs.

Wait, I think the skin is one of the organs with lower energy expenditure. But I'm trying to remember specific rates. I think the brain is high, followed by liver, heart, kidneys, etc. So the lowest would be something like the skin or maybe the lungs or stomach.

Wait, another approach: Energy expenditure per kg. So which organ is known for low metabolic rate per mass.

I remember that the liver, despite being a large organ, has a high metabolic rate. The brain is high because of its function. The heart is a muscle, so it's active. So perhaps the skin is lower, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the lungs: they have a lot of surface area but I'm not sure about their energy use per kg. Wait, the lungs are part of the respiratory system, moving air but maybe not using as much energy as the heart or liver.

Wait, perhaps the stomach? It churns food, uses some energy, but maybe not the highest. Or the intestines, which have a lot of cells and movement, perhaps higher.

Hmm, another thought: The energy expenditure per organ can be ranked. From what I recall, the order from highest to lowest might be something like: Brain, liver, heart, kidneys, then others like lungs, skin, etc.

Wait, I think the skin actually has a lower energy expenditure per unit mass compared to these other organs. Because it's not as metabolically active as the liver or brain. So H: Skin might be the correct answer.

Alternatively, I've heard that the lungs themselves don't use a lot of energy, but the diaphragm (a muscle) does when breathing. But the question is about the organ itself.

So putting it together, maybe the skin has the lowest energy expenditure per kg.

The question asks which organ has the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass (kg). To determine this, we analyze the metabolic activity of each organ relative to its size.

- **Brain (F):** Despite its small size, the brain is highly metabolically active, accounting for about 20% of the body's energy expenditure. This makes it one of the highest, not the lowest.
- **Heart (B):** The heart is a continuously working muscle, requiring significant energy to pump blood throughout the body. Its energy expenditure is relatively high.
- **Liver (E):** The liver performs numerous metabolic functions, including detoxification and metabolism, making it highly energy-intensive.
- **Kidney (D):** The kidneys are active in filtering blood and regulating fluids, resulting in a high energy expenditure.
- **Lungs (C):** While the lungs are essential for respiration, their energy expenditure per unit mass is not as high as organs like the brain or liver.
- **Intestines (A):** The intestines are involved in digestion and absorption, which requires energy, but their expenditure is moderate.
- **Stomach (G):** The stomach churns food and uses digestive enzymes, but its energy expenditure is not the lowest.
- **Pancreas (J):** The pancreas secretes enzymes and hormones, but its energy expenditure is moderate compared to other organs.
- **Skin (H):** The skin is the largest organ and plays a role in protection and temperature regulation. It is less metabolically active compared to organs like the brain, liver, or heart, making it a strong candidate for the lowest energy expenditure per unit mass.
- **Skeletal Muscle (I):** While skeletal muscles can use significant energy during activity, at rest their energy expenditure is lower. However, skin is likely lower due to its inherently lower metabolic activity.

Considering these factors, the skin (H) is the organ with the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass.

Answer: H
