Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what Hursthouse says about the claim that any adequate moral theory must provide clear guidance. I remember that Hursthouse is a virtue ethicist, so her views are probably related to that. 

Virtue ethics focuses on the character of the person rather than specific rules or consequences. So, I think she might argue against the idea that a moral theory needs to give clear, action-guiding rules. Because in virtue ethics, what's right depends on the virtuous person's judgment in each situation, not a set of strict rules.

The question is about whether she thinks the claim is plausible. The options are things like the claim is true, controversial, irrelevant, etc. I remember reading that Hursthouse criticizes the idea that moral theories need to be action-guiding in a clear way. She argues that virtue ethics isn't about providing such clear guidance because real-life situations are too complex and context-dependent.

So she probably doesn't think the claim is true. Instead, she might find the claim implausible because she believes that an adequate moral theory doesn't need to offer that kind of straightforward guidance. That would mean the answer is I: She says the claim is implausible.

Wait, I should double-check. Hursthouse's argument is that moral theories like virtue ethics don't aim to provide a decision procedure. She thinks the expectation that they should is based on a misunderstanding. So yes, she would find the claim that any adequate theory must provide clear guidance to be implausible.

The claim that any adequate moral theory must provide clear guidance is viewed as implausible by Hursthouse. As a virtue ethicist, she emphasizes the complexity and context-dependency of real-life situations, arguing that moral judgment relies on the virtuous person's discernment rather than rigid rules.

I: She says the claim is implausible.

Answer: I
