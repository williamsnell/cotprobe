The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A mail clerk domiciled in State A slipped and fell on ice that had formed near the loading dock of the building in State B where the clerk's State B employer leased space for its headquarters. The building was owned and operated by a State C corporation. As a result of the fall, the clerk was injured and the employer's expensive computer he was carrying was badly damaged. The clerk sued the building owner for negligence in a federal district court in State B, seeking $100,000 in personal-injury damages. The employer has filed a timely motion to intervene, asserting an $80,000 negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer. Is the court likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene?

Options:

A: No, because the employer cannot intervene in a personal injury case.
B: No, because the employer's claim is not directly related to the clerk's personal injury claim.
C: Yes, because the employer also has a direct negligence claim against the building owner.
D: No, because although the employer has an interest in the clerk's action, that interest is not likely to be impaired in the employer's absence.
E: Yes, because the employer has a financial interest in the outcome of the clerk's case.
F: No, because the employer's claim exceeds the amount the clerk is seeking in damages.
G: Yes, because the employer is an indispensable party.
H: Yes, because the employer's claim and the clerk's claim arose from the same incident.
I: Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.
J: No, because the clerk chose not to join the employer as a co-plaintiff in his action.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the court will grant the employer's motion to intervene in this case. Let me break down the problem step by step.

The scenario is about a mail clerk who was injured in a slip and fall accident in State B. The clerk is suing the building owner (a State C corporation) for negligence in federal court in State B, seeking $100,000 for personal injuries. The employer, who is based in State B, wants to intervene because their computer was damaged, and they have an $80,000 claim against the building owner for negligence.

I remember that intervention is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24. There are two types: intervention as of right and permissive intervention. For intervention as of right, the applicant must show that they have a sufficient interest in the subject matter, that their interest isn't adequately represented by existing parties, and that they'll be impaired if not allowed to intervene.

So first, the employer must have an interest in the case. Here, the employer has a direct claim for the damaged computer. That seems like a sufficient interest because the outcome of the clerk's case could affect the employer's ability to recover for their loss.

Next, is the employer's interest adequately represented by existing parties? The clerk is suing for personal injury, and the employer is suing for property damage. Their interests are related but distinct. The clerk might not prioritize the employer's claim, especially since they're different types of damages. So the employer's interest might not be adequately represented.

Then, the employer's interest must be impaired without intervention. If the clerk's case goes against the building owner, the building owner might raise defenses or have their liability determined in a way that affects the employer's separate claim. For example, if the building owner is found not liable for the slip and fall, the employer's claim would be impacted. So the employer's interest could be impaired if they're not part of the case.

Additionally, the employer's claim arises from the same incident as the clerk's claim. They both stem from the accident at the loading dock. So there are common questions of law and fact, which is a factor considered in permissive intervention, but for intervention as of right, the main factors are the three points above.

Looking at the options, option C says yes because the employer has a direct negligence claim. That makes sense because the employer's claim is separate but related. Option I mentions common questions, which supports intervention as of right because it's one of the factors, but the primary basis is the direct interest and impairment.

Option D suggests that the employer's interest isn't likely impaired. But I think that's incorrect because without intervention, the employer risks having the building owner's liability determined without their participation, which could prevent them from pursuing their own claim effectively.

Option E is about financial interest, which the employer does have, but that alone isn't sufficient. They need to meet the criteria under Rule 24.

So putting it all together, the employer meets the requirements for intervention as of right because they have an interest, their interest isn't adequately represented, and they'd be impaired without intervention. Therefore, the court is likely to grant the motion to intervene.

The court is likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene because the employer has a sufficient interest in the case, specifically a direct negligence claim for the damage to its computer. The employer's interest is not adequately represented by the clerk, as the clerk's claim focuses on personal injury, while the employer's claim pertains to property damage. Additionally, the employer's interest could be impaired if it is not allowed to intervene, as the outcome of the clerk's case may affect the employer's ability to recover for its loss. The employer's claim arises from the same incident as the clerk's claim, sharing common questions of law and fact, which further supports intervention.

The correct answer is **C**.
