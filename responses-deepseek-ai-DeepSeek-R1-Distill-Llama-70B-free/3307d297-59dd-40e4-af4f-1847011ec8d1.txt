Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Gordon Allport's approach to personality research. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology theories, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what's unique about Allport's approach. The options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Allport emphasized genetic inheritance. Hmm, I remember that some theories focus a lot on genetics, like maybe the trait theories. But wasn't Allport more about individual traits rather than genetics? I think he focused on the unique aspects of each person rather than inherited factors. Maybe not A.

Option B: Personality formed through adult social interactions. I'm not too sure. I think Allport's work was more about traits and their structure. I don't recall him focusing specifically on adulthood interactions. Maybe someone else, like Erikson? So probably not B.

Option C: Childhood experiences. That sounds more like Freud or maybe the psychodynamic approach. Allport was a trait theorist, I think, so his approach might not center on childhood as much. So C might not be it.

Option D: Environment has no impact. That doesn't sound right. Most personality theories acknowledge some environmental influence. Allport probably considered it, so D is likely incorrect.

Option E: Believed in general principles. Wait, I think Allport made a distinction between nomothetic and ideographic approaches. Nomothetic is about general laws and principles across people, while ideographic is about individual cases. But I think Allport preferred the ideographic method, so maybe E isn't correct because he might have valued the individual approach more than general principles.

Option F: Hierarchy of needs. Oh, that's Abraham Maslow's theory. So F is definitely not Allport.

Option G: Stressed difference between nomothetic and ideographic and preferred ideographic. Yes, this rings a bell. Allport is known for distinguishing between these two methods. Nomothetic looks for general laws, while ideographic focuses on the unique individual. He emphasized the importance of the ideographic approach, which is about understanding each person's unique traits and experiences. So G seems correct.

Option H: Five-factor model. That's the Big Five, which was developed later, I think by other researchers like McCrae and Costa. Not Allport, so H is incorrect.

Option I: Collective unconscious. That's Carl Jung's concept, part of analytical psychology. So I is not Allport.

Option J: Unconscious processes. Again, more Freudian. Allport's trait theory doesn't focus much on the unconscious; he was more about conscious traits and their unique expressions. So J is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the unique aspect of Allport's approach is that he stressed the difference between nomothetic and ideographic methods and preferred the ideographic. So the correct answer should be G.

Gordon Allport is unique in his approach to personality research because he emphasized the distinction between nomothetic and ideographic methods. While nomothetic focuses on general principles across individuals, Allport preferred the ideographic method, which centers on understanding the unique experiences and traits of each individual. This sets his approach apart from others who prioritize general laws or other factors like genetics, environment, or unconscious processes.

Answer: G
