Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Gunpowder Weaponry: Europe vs. China
In Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s, early cannons, as heavy and as slow to fire as they were, proved useful enough in the protracted sieges that dominated warfare during this period that governments found it sufficiently worthwhile to pay for them and for the experimentation that eventually produced gunpowder weapons that were both more powerful and easier to move. By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.
The argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?

Options:

A: Why Silk Road commerce dwindled across the breadth of Eurasia after 1500 C.E.
B: How societies shared strategically important technologies with each other
C: How the threat of steppe nomads shaped China's military strategy in the 1300s
D: Why China and Europe had different military strategies during the Middle Ages
E: How the medieval climatic optimum affected the process of cultural diffusion
F: Why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era
G: How the development of gunpowder weaponry influenced the outcomes of wars in the Middle Ages
H: How the geopolitical environment influenced the development of military technology in different regions
I: Why China chose to invest in horse archer units instead of gunpowder weaponry during the medieval period
J: How the development of gunpowder weaponry was influenced by the economic status of countries

Okay, so I've got this history question here about gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China. Let me read through it carefully.

The passage explains that in Western Europe from the 1200s to 1400s, early cannons were heavy and slow but useful in sieges, so governments invested in improving them. On the other hand, China faced mobile steppe nomads after the mid-1300s, and the early gunpowder weapons weren't useful against them, so China focused on improving horse archer units instead.

The question is asking which large-scale global history question this passage relates to. The options are A through J.

First, I need to understand what the passage is arguing. It's comparing the military strategies of Europe and China during a certain period, based on the threats they faced. Europe's enemies required siege warfare, making cannons worth the investment. China's enemies were mobile, so they focused on mounted archers.

So the main idea is about how different threats influenced military technology development in each region.

Looking at the options:

A: Silk Road decline after 1500. The passage doesn't mention trade or the Silk Road, so probably not A.

B: Sharing of technologies. The passage is about each region developing their own strategies, not sharing, so B might not fit.

C: Steppe nomads shaping China's strategy. Well, the passage says China focused on horse archers because of the steppe nomads, so this seems relevant. But the question is about the larger argument, which compares Europe and China.

D: Different military strategies between China and Europe during Middle Ages. Yes, the passage talks about differences, so D is a possibility.

E: Medieval climatic optimum and cultural diffusion. The passage doesn't discuss climate, so E is out.

F: European military superiority over non-Western powers. The passage is about the Middle Ages, but F is about the modern era, so maybe not.

G: Gunpowder's influence on medieval wars. The passage is more about why gunpowder developed differently in each region, not the outcomes of wars.

H: Geopolitical environment influencing military tech development. This seems to align because Europe and China's different enemies (geopolitical threats) led to different tech focuses.

I: China investing in archers over gunpowder. The passage does say that, but again, the argument is broader about both regions.

J: Economic status influencing gunpowder development. The passage doesn't mention economics, so J is out.

So the options are down to C, D, H, I.

The passage's argument is about how the geopolitical threats (enemies) each region faced influenced their military technology development. So H seems spot on because it's about the geopolitical environment (the threats) shaping the military tech.

Alternatively, D is about different strategies, which is also correct, but H is more specific about the cause (geopolitical environment) leading to the effect.

I think the answer is H.

The passage discusses how the geopolitical environment, specifically the types of threats each region faced, influenced the development of military technology in Europe and China. Europe focused on improving gunpowder weapons for siege warfare, while China concentrated on horse archers due to the threat of mobile steppe nomads. This aligns with option H, which directly addresses how the geopolitical environment shaped military technology.

H
