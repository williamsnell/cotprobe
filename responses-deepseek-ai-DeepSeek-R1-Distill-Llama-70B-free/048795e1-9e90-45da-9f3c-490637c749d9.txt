Okay, so I've got this economics question in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about expansionary fiscal policy and when there's more crowding out. Crowding out, as I remember from my classes, is when government spending or taxation reduces private sector spending, particularly investment. So, if the government increases its spending or cuts taxes, it can lead to higher interest rates, which in turn makes borrowing more expensive for businesses, causing them to invest less. That's crowding out.

The question is asking under what condition there is relatively more crowding out. The options are A to J.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: The central bank pursues a contractionary monetary policy.

Wait, if the central bank is doing contractionary monetary policy, that means they might be raising interest rates or reducing money supply. If they're doing this alongside expansionary fiscal policy, how does that affect crowding out? Well, if fiscal policy is expansionary, it tends to increase interest rates because the government might be borrowing more. But if the central bank is also being contractionary, maybe they're offsetting that by reducing the money supply, which could lower interest rates. So less crowding out because interest rates don't rise as much. So maybe this situation leads to less crowding out, not more. So A might not be the right answer.

Option B: Expansionary monetary policy accompanies the fiscal policy.

If monetary policy is expansionary, that means lower interest rates. So when the government does expansionary fiscal policy (like spending or tax cuts), the increase in interest rates due to higher borrowing might be mitigated by the central bank's actions. So less crowding out. So B would mean less, not more, so B isn't the correct answer.

Option C: The government cuts taxes rather than increasing spending.

Hmm, tax cuts versus spending. I think the effect on crowding out depends on how each affects interest rates. If the government cuts taxes, people have more income, which might lead to higher consumption but maybe not as much as direct government spending. However, in terms of borrowing: whether the government is borrowing more to fund spending or tax cuts, the effect on interest rates could be similar. Wait, but maybe tax cuts don't lead to as much increase in interest rates as government spending because people might save some of the tax cuts. Or perhaps the opposite. I'm not sure. I'll have to think more about this. Maybe it's a matter of which has a bigger effect on aggregate demand and thus interest rates. If spending increases directly, that's a bigger bang, so more borrowing, higher interest rates, more crowding out. Whereas tax cuts might lead to some increase in consumption but perhaps not as much as government spending. So, in that case, maybe cutting taxes leads to less crowding out than increasing spending. So the question is when is crowding out more. So the scenario where government is increasing spending would have more crowding out than cutting taxes. So if the question is about when crowding out is more, then option C is when the govt cuts taxes rather than increases spending. So in that case, if the question is about when there's more crowding out, then this scenario (C) would have less. So C is not the answer.

Option D: The investment demand curve is perfectly inelastic.

Wait, the investment demand curve's elasticity matters because it shows how responsive investment is to changes in interest rates. If the investment demand is perfectly inelastic, that means that even if interest rates change, the quantity of investment doesn't change. So in that case, any increase in interest rates due to expansionary fiscal policy wouldn't reduce investment. So there would be no crowding out. So D is a situation where crowding out is zero, so not the case where crowding out is more. So D is not the answer.

Option E: Government spending improves profit expectations among businesses.

If government spending makes businesses think that profits will be higher, that could encourage them to invest more. So, even if interest rates go up, their expectation of higher profits might make them more willing to invest. So this could reduce the crowding out effect because businesses are more inclined to invest despite higher interest rates. So E would lead to less crowding out, not more. So E isn't the correct answer.

Option F: The investment demand curve is inelastic.

Investment demand inelastic means that a change in interest rates doesn't lead to a big change in investment. So, if interest rates rise due to expansionary fiscal policy, but investment doesn't drop much because demand is inelastic, then the crowding out effect is smaller. So F would mean less crowding out, so F isn't the answer.

Option G: The investment demand curve is elastic.

Elastic investment demand means that a small change in interest rates leads to a large change in investment. So if interest rates rise due to fiscal expansion, and investment is elastic, then investment will drop a lot. So that's more crowding out. So G would mean more crowding out. So G is a possible answer.

Option H: The economy is in a boom period.

During a boom, the economy is already near or at full employment. So, expansionary fiscal policy would likely cause more inflation and maybe more crowding out. Because in a boom, the economy has less slack, so government spending might lead to higher interest rates, which would reduce investment. Alternatively, if the economy is in a recession, it's below full employment, so maybe there's more room for fiscal policy without causing much crowding out. So H, being in a boom, would lead to more crowding out, so H is a possible answer.

Option I: The economy is in a recession.

In a recession, there's excess capacity, perhaps lower interest rates, and fiscal policy might be more effective without causing as much crowding out. So I would mean less crowding out, so I is not the answer.

Option J: Government spending is primarily focused on infrastructure.

Infrastructure spending can have different effects. It might be considered more productive, which could lead to higher future output and maybe encourage more investment. Alternatively, if the government is borrowing a lot for infrastructure, it could increase interest rates now, leading to more crowding out. But I'm not sure if infrastructure spending has a different effect on crowding out compared to other types of spending. Maybe not, so perhaps J isn't the right answer.

So, let me recap the possible options that lead to more crowding out.

Option G: Elastic investment demand. Because higher interest rates would lead to a larger decrease in investment.

Option H: Economy in a boom. Because the economy is already near full employment, so expansionary fiscal policy would lead to higher interest rates, more crowding out.

Wait, but which of these is more about crowding out. Let's think again.

Crowding out occurs because the fiscal expansion causes interest rates to rise, which reduces private investment. So, the extent of crowding out depends on how sensitive investment is to interest rates (elasticity) and the state of the economy.

If the investment demand is elastic (G), then a rise in interest rates causes a big drop in investment, leading to more crowding out.

If the economy is in a boom (H), perhaps the demand for loanable funds is high, so even a small increase in government borrowing would push interest rates up a lot, leading to more crowding out.

So both G and H could be factors. But the question is asking which situation leads to relatively more crowding out.

Wait, the options are all possible, so the answer is either G or H.

Wait, the options are presented as possible causes. So which one is correct?

Let me think about the theory.

Crowding out is more likely when investment is more sensitive to interest rates. So elastic investment demand (G) would mean more crowding out. Because a given increase in interest rates would lead to a larger decrease in investment. So G would be correct.

Alternatively, when the economy is in a boom, it's already at full employment, so any fiscal expansion would lead to higher interest rates, leading to more crowding out than when the economy is in a slump. So H could also be correct.

Wait, but the question is about when there's "relatively more" crowding out as a result of expansionary fiscal policy. So, under what conditions would expansionary fiscal policy cause more crowding out.

If the economy is in a boom, the fiscal expansion is more likely to be met with higher interest rates because the economy is already growing, so perhaps more demand for funds. So higher interest rates would cause more crowding out. So H could be correct.

Alternatively, if the investment demand is elastic (G), then any increase in interest rates would lead to more crowding out. So G is also correct.

So I need to figure out which of these is the correct answer.

Wait, let me check the textbook or my notes. Crowding out is more significant when investment is more responsive to interest rates, which is when the investment demand curve is elastic (G). Also, during a boom, the economy is more likely to have higher interest rates, leading to more crowding out. So both factors can contribute.

But the options are separate. So the question is, which of these is a situation that leads to more crowding out.

So if the investment demand is elastic (G), then a given interest rate increase would cause a larger drop in investment, so more crowding out.

If the economy is in a boom (H), perhaps the initial interest rates are higher, and the fiscal policy would lead to even higher rates, causing more crowding out.

So both could be correct, but the question is which option is correct.

Wait, looking at the options, the question is phrased: "when is there relatively more crowding out as a result of expansionary fiscal policy."

So, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is H.

Wait, another angle: during a boom, the economy is already producing near capacity. So expansionary fiscal policy would cause the government to borrow more, pushing up interest rates, leading to more crowding out. In a recession, there's more slack, so the interest rates might not rise as much, so less crowding out.

So H would lead to more crowding out.

Thus, the correct answer could be H.

Wait, but the question is about the options, so let me think again.

Wait, for example, in the case where the economy is in a boom, the government's expansionary fiscal policy would have a larger effect on interest rates, leading to more crowding out. So H is correct.

Alternatively, the elasticity of investment demand is a direct determinant of how much investment drops when interest rates rise. So if investment is elastic (G), then the same increase in interest rates would cause a larger drop in investment, leading to more crowding out.

So both G and H could lead to more crowding out. But the question is which option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is G because it's more directly about the responsiveness of investment.

But I'm a bit confused now. Let me think of an example.

Suppose during a boom, the economy is growing, so the demand for loanable funds is high. If the government increases spending, it borrows more, which could cause a bigger increase in interest rates, leading to more crowding out. So H would lead to more crowding out.

Alternatively, if investment demand is elastic, any increase in interest rates (whether big or small) would lead to a larger decrease in investment, so more crowding.

So both factors contribute, but the question is which of the options is correct.

Looking at the possible answers, I think I remember that when the investment demand is elastic (i.e., sensitive to interest rates), the crowding out effect is larger.

So the correct answer would be F or G. Wait, no. Let me check the options:

Option F: Investment demand is inelastic.

Option G: Elastic.

Because elastic means more responsive, so G is correct.

So I think the answer is G.

Wait, but I also thought that the state of the economy (boom) would lead to more crowding out.

Hmm, perhaps in this question, the correct answer is G.

Wait, no, I think the correct answer is F: The investment demand curve is inelastic. Wait, no, that's the opposite.

No, wait, if the investment demand is elastic, then a change in interest rates causes a large change in investment. So more crowding out.

So the correct answer is G.

But I'm a bit torn between G and H.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about when expansionary fiscal policy leads to more crowding out.

Crowding out occurs because higher government borrowing leads to higher interest rates, which reduces private investment.

The amount of crowding out depends on two things: how much fiscal policy affects interest rates, and how responsive investment is to those interest rates.

If the economy is in a boom, the demand for funds is already high, so fiscal policy would cause a bigger increase in interest rates, leading to more crowding out.

If investment demand is elastic, then even a moderate increase in interest rates would lead to a large drop in investment, also causing more crowding out.

So both factors contribute, but the options are each separate.

Looking at the possible answers, the question is which situation would result in relatively more crowding out.

So, G and H are both possible. But the options are given as A to J, and I can only choose one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H.

Wait, I think in the context of the question, the correct answer is H: The economy is in a boom period.

Because when the economy is booming, the demand for loanable funds is high, so expansionary fiscal policy (which increases the demand for loanable funds further) would lead to a larger increase in interest rates, causing more crowding out.

In a recession, with plenty of unemployed resources, the same fiscal expansion might not increase interest rates as much, so less crowding out.

Thus, the correct answer is H.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the responsiveness of investment to interest rates (elasticity) is a more direct determinant.

Wait, for example, even in a boom, if investment is inelastic, a rise in interest rates wouldn't reduce investment much. So the elasticity is a key factor.

So, I'm a bit stuck between G and H.

But I think the correct answer is G: the investment demand curve is elastic.

Because the elasticity directly determines how much investment is crowded out for a given change in interest rates.

So, when investment demand is elastic, any increase in interest rates (no matter the cause) leads to a bigger drop in investment, thus more crowding out.

So, I'll go with G.

Crowding out occurs when expansionary fiscal policy leads to higher interest rates, reducing private sector investment. The question asks under what condition there is relatively more crowding out. Let’s analyze the options:

- **Option A**: If the central bank pursues contractionary monetary policy, it could offset the interest rate increases caused by fiscal expansion, leading to less crowding out. Thus, this is not the correct answer.  
- **Option B**: Expansionary monetary policy would lower interest rates, reducing the crowding out effect. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.  
- **Option C**: Tax cuts may lead to less borrowing compared to government spending, potentially causing smaller interest rate increases and less crowding out. Hence, this is not the correct answer.  
- **Option D**: If the investment demand curve is perfectly inelastic, investment does not respond to interest rate changes, resulting in no crowding out. Thus, this is not the correct answer.  
- **Option E**: Improved profit expectations could encourage businesses to invest more despite higher interest rates, reducing crowding out. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.  
- **Option F**: An inelastic investment demand curve means investment does not respond much to interest rate changes, leading to less crowding out. Hence, this is not the correct answer.  
- **Option G**: An elastic investment demand curve means investment is highly responsive to interest rate changes. A rise in interest rates due to fiscal expansion would lead to a significant drop in investment, causing more crowding out. This is a strong candidate for the correct answer.  
- **Option H**: During a boom, the economy is near full employment, and the demand for loanable funds is high. Expansionary fiscal policy would likely cause a larger increase in interest rates, leading to more crowding out. This is also a strong candidate for the correct answer.  
- **Option I**: In a recession, there is more slack in the economy, and interest rates may not rise as much, leading to less crowding out. Thus, this is not the correct answer.  
- **Option J**: Infrastructure spending might have long-term benefits, but it does not directly explain why crowding out would be more significant. Hence, this is not the correct answer.  

Both **G** and **H** are plausible, but the question focuses on the condition most directly tied to the responsiveness of investment to interest rates. An elastic investment demand curve (G) means that even a moderate increase in interest rates would lead to a large drop in investment, causing more crowding out. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**G: The investment demand curve is elastic.**
