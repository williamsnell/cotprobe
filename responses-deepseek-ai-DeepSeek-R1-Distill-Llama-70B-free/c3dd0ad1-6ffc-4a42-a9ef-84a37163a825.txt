The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Walter, a widower, died in 1997 leaving $1,000,000 to Trend Trust Company in trust to pay the income to his son, Stan, for life. Stan was married to Morgana and had two children, Andrew and Beverly. Walter's will provided in part:"The net income from this trust shall be paid to my son, Stan, for his life. Upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. Upon the death of Stan's widow, Trend Trust Company shall then pay the income (from said trust) to the living children of my sister, Harriet, in equal shares. "Harriet's only surviving child, Grace, was born in 2001. Both Stan and Morgana died in an airplane crash in 2009. There is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction. Harriet, on behalf of Grace, brings an appropriate action against the Trend Trust Company and Walter's estate to allow the distribution of the income from said trust to be paid to Grace. Is Harriet likely to prevail in this action?

Options:

A: No, because the provisions under which Grace was intended to take violate the Rule against Perpetuities.
B: Yes, because Grace is the only surviving child of Harriet and therefore is entitled to the income from the trust.
C: Yes, because the death of Stan and Morgana in an airplane crash in 2009 triggered the provision for the income to be paid to the living children of Harriet.
D: Yes, because that was Walter's intent.
E: No, because the trust was to be paid to Grace only after the death of any widow of Stan, and Morgana's death nullified this provision.
F: Yes, because there is no statute modifying the common law in this jurisdiction that would prevent Grace from receiving the income from the trust.
G: Yes, because all other persons who would have had any claim to the income from the trust corpus are deceased.
H: No, because the trust explicitly states that the income is to be paid to the living children of Harriet only after the death of Stan's widow.
I: No, because the Rule against Perpetuities prevents the trust from being held indefinitely.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about trusts and the Rule against Perpetuities. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is about Walter's will setting up a trust. Let me outline the facts:

- Walter died in 1997, leaving $1,000,000 in trust with Trend Trust Company.
- The trust is supposed to pay the net income to his son, Stan, for life.
- After Stan's death, the income goes to Stan's widow (if any) until she dies.
- Then, after the widow's death, the income goes to the living children of Walter's sister, Harriet, in equal shares.

Now, some key points:

1. Stan was married to Morgana, and they had two children, Andrew and Beverly.
2. Harriet's only surviving child is Grace, born in 2001.
3. Stan and Morgana both died in 2009 in a plane crash.

The question is whether Harriet, on behalf of Grace, can get the trust income now. The options are A to J, but the choices given are A to I, so I'll focus on those.

The first thing I need to determine is what happens after Stan's death. The will says that upon Stan's death, the income goes to his widow. If the widow dies, then it goes to Harriet's children. But in this case, Stan and Morgana died together in 2009. So, Stan's widow (Morgana) didn't survive him—she died at the same time.

So, does that mean the next beneficiary is Harriet's children? Well, the will says upon Stan's death, the income is to be paid to "any widow of Stan." If there's no widow surviving Stan, then what happens? Does the income go directly to Harriet's children?

But wait, when does that happen? Let me think. The will says, upon Stan's death, pay to his widow. If there's a widow, she gets it for life. Upon her death, then to Harriet's children. But if there's no widow, because she died with Stan, does the income pass immediately to Harriet's living children?

I think that's the case. Because if the widow doesn't survive Stan, the condition for her taking doesn't occur, so the next contingency, which is the death of the widow, doesn't happen either. So perhaps the trust proceeds to the next beneficiaries.

But wait, let's make sure. The language is: "Upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. Upon the death of Stan's widow, ... pay to Harriet's children." So if there's no widow, then the second condition (upon widow's death) doesn't occur. So does the income pass to Harriet's children immediately upon Stan's death if there's no widow?

Hmm, that's a point of construction. The will might imply that after Stan's death, the income is paid to the widow, and upon her death, to Harriet's children. But if there's no widow, perhaps the gift to Harriet's children is contingent on the widow dying. But if the widow is dead, maybe the condition is satisfied, so it goes to Harriet's children.

Alternatively, perhaps the gift to Harriet's children is subject to the prior condition of the widow's death. So if the widow is dead when Stan dies, then the condition is met, and it goes to Harriet's children.

So in this case, since Morgana died with Stan, the widow didn't survive, so the income should go to Harriet's children upon Stan's death.

But wait, there's another issue: the Rule against Perpetuities. Because the trust might vest beyond the allowed period.

The Rule against Perpetuities (RAP) says that any contingent interest must vest, if at all, within 21 years after the death of a life in being at the time the interest was created. If it might vest beyond that, it's void.

So when was the interest created? The trust was created in Walter's will, which took effect at his death in 1997.

The beneficiaries after Stan's widow's death are Harriet's children. But Harriet's child, Grace, was born in 2001—so four years after the trust was created. That's a problem because, at the time the trust was created, Harriet had no children (since Grace was born later). So the class of Harriet's children wasn't ascertained at the creation of the trust.

Wait, but Harriet is a sister of Walter, so she was a life in being. So any children of Harriet would have to be born to her, and since she's a life in being, any children she has would be born within her lifetime, which would be within the perpetuity period. Wait, but Grace was born after Walter's death. Hmm, but the RAP requires that the interest must vest within 21 years of a life in being. So if the interest vests when Harriet's children are alive, but since Harriet is a life in being, any children she has would be born during her lifetime, which is within the perpetuity period.

Wait, but let me think again. The trust is to pay to Stan for life, then to his widow for life, then to Harriet's children. So the interest of Harriet's children is contingent on two prior events: Stan dying, and his widow dying. The problem is whether the interest of Harriet's children vests within the perpetuity period.

So, the interest of Harriet's children is a contingent remainder. It's contingent on both Stan dying and the widow dying. The measuring life would be the widow—because the widow could, in theory, live beyond the perpetuity period if she's not a life in being at the creation of the trust.

Wait, but in this case, the widow is Morgana, who was Stan's wife. At the time Walter's will took effect (1997), Morgana was already Stan's wife, so she was a life in being. So, her life is the measuring life. Therefore, any interest that vests upon her death would be within the perpetuity period, because she's a life in being.

Wait, but Grace was born in 2001. So when the trust was created in 1997, Harriet had no children. So the class of Harriet's children was open, and the identity of the children couldn't be determined until after 1997.

But under RAP, the interest must vest, if at all, within 21 years of some life in being at the time of the creation of the interest. In this case, the interest is in Harriet's children. Since Harriet is a life in being, any children she has would be born during her lifetime. So the latest possible time for the interest to vest is Harriet's death plus 21 years. So that's within the perpetuity period. Therefore, the interest does not violate RAP.

Wait, but wait another point: the problem is that when the trust was created in 1997, Harriet had no children. So the class is an open class that could include after-born children. But since Harriet is a life in being, any children she has would be born during her life, which is within the perpetuity period. So the interest is valid under RAP.

So, Grace, born in 2001, is a child of Harriet, a life in being, so her interest is okay under RAP.

Alternatively, does the fact that Grace was born after Walter's death affect this? No, because the perpetuity period is measured from lives in being at the time the interest was created. So Grace's interest, as a child of Harriet (a life in being), is valid.

Therefore, option A says the provisions violate RAP, which would mean Grace can't take. But I think that's not correct because Harriet is a life in being, so Grace's interest vests at the time of Harriet's death, which is within the perpetuity period.

Wait, but another angle: The interest of Harriet's children is subject to the prior condition of Stan's widow dying. Since Stan's widow is Morgana, who was a life in being, her death would be within the perpetuity period. Therefore, the interest of Harriet's children would vest, if at all, at the time of Morgana's death, which is within the perpetuity period because Morgana is a life in being.

But in this case, both Stan and Morgana died in 2009. So upon Stan's death, the income was supposed to go to Morgana, but since she died, the next step is to pay to Harriet's children.

So, in this scenario, after Stan's death, there's no widow surviving, so the income should go to Harriet's living children. But wait, the will says "Upon Stan's death, the net income is to be paid to any widow of Stan. Upon the death of Stan's widow, ... pay to Harriet's children."

So, the payment to Harriet's children is contingent upon the death of Stan's widow. If the widow dies, then it goes to Harriet's children. But if the widow is dead when Stan dies (as in this case), then the condition for paying to Harriet's children is met, because the widow is dead. So the income should go to Harriet's children upon Stan's death.

But let me check the options again.

Option C says: Yes, because the death of Stan and Morgana in 2009 triggered the provision for the income to be paid to Harriet's children.

That makes sense. Because upon Stan's death, since there's no surviving widow, the next condition (widow's death) is effectively met, so it goes to Harriet's children.

So Harriet, on behalf of Grace, would be entitled to the income now.

But wait, looking at the options, option H says: No, because the trust explicitly states that the income is to be paid to Harriet's children only after the death of Stan's widow.

In this case, the widow died at the same time as Stan, so the condition is satisfied. So option H would be incorrect because the condition (widow's death) has occurred.

Option B: Yes, because Grace is the only surviving child of Harriet. That's a possible reason, but it's not necessarily the only reason. Whether she's the only one matters for distribution but not for the initial entitlement.

Option D: Yes, because of Walter's intent. The question is about the legal effect, not just intent, though the intent is relevant in construction.

Option F: Yes, because no statute modifies the common law. I think that's a factor regarding RAP, but if RAP doesn't apply, then this could be a reason. But I think RAP is satisfied here, so F might not be the best choice.

Option G: Yes, because all others are deceased. That's true, but the main issue is whether the condition is met.

Option I: No, because RAP prevents indefinite holding. But as discussed, RAP is satisfied, so I is incorrect.

Option E: No, because the trust was to be paid only after the widow's death, and Morgana's death nullified it. That doesn't make sense because the widow's death is the condition for the next payment.

So, putting it all together, since both Stan and Morgana died, the condition for the income to go to Harriet's children is met. And the RAP doesn't prevent it because Harriet is a life in being, and Morgana was a life in being as well.

So the correct answer should be option C: Yes, because the deaths triggered the provision.

Alternatively, option B could be incorrect because it's about being the only child, but the primary reason is the triggering event.

Wait, but looking back, the trust says upon Stan's death, pay to widow; upon widow's death, pay to Harriet's children. So if the widow dies with Stan, the condition for paying to Harriet's children is that the widow is dead, which is true. So the income should go to Harriet's children upon Stan's death.

So Harriet can collect for Grace because the condition is met.

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but another thought: The income is to be paid to the widow, but if she's dead, does that mean the interest is to be paid to Harriet's children immediately upon Stan's death? Or does it have to wait until the widow's death, which happened simultaneously?

I think it's the former. Since the widow is dead, the condition for Harriet's children is met, so the income starts going to them right away.

So yes, option C is correct.

The question revolves around the distribution of trust income following the deaths of Stan and his wife, Morgana, in 2009. Walter's will created a trust with the following provisions: income is paid to Stan for life, then to Stan's widow for life, and upon the widow's death, to the living children of Walter's sister, Harriet, in equal shares. Harriet's only surviving child, Grace, was born in 2001. The key issue is whether Grace is entitled to the trust income after Stan and Morgana's deaths.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Upon Stan's Death**: The will directs the income to be paid to Stan's widow. However, Morgana died simultaneously with Stan, meaning there was no surviving widow to take the income.

2. **Condition for Harriet's Children**: The will provides that upon the death of Stan's widow, the income is to be paid to Harriet's children. Since Morgana died at the same time as Stan, the condition for paying the income to Harriet's children is effectively satisfied.

3. **Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP)**: The trust does not violate RAP because Harriet is a "life in being" at the time the trust was created (1997). Any children of Harriet, including Grace (born in 2001), would inherit within the perpetuity period (Harriet's lifetime or 21 years after her death). Thus, Grace's interest is valid under RAP.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The trust does not violate RAP because Harriet is a life in being, ensuring the interest vests within the perpetuity period.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. While Grace is the only surviving child of Harriet, this is not the primary reason for her entitlement. The entitlement arises because the condition for paying to Harriet's children was triggered by Morgana's death.
   - **Option C**: Correct. The deaths of Stan and Morgana in 2009 triggered the provision for the income to be paid to Harriet's children, as the condition of the widow's death was met.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While Walter's intent is relevant, the legal entitlement is determined by the will's terms and the triggering of conditions, not solely by intent.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. Morgana's death did not nullify the provision; it satisfied the condition for the income to pass to Harriet's children.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. While the absence of a statute modifying the common law is noted, this is not the primary reason for Grace's entitlement.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. While all other potential beneficiaries are deceased, this is not the primary reason for Grace's entitlement.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The trust explicitly states that the income is paid to Harriet's children upon the death of Stan's widow, which occurred when Morgana died.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The trust does not violate RAP, so it is not prevented from being held indefinitely.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **C**, as the deaths of Stan and Morgana triggered the provision for the income to be paid to Harriet's children, and Grace, as Harriet's only surviving child, is entitled to the income.
