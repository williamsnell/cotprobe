Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an object being released and falling a certain distance. Hmm, I remember that when objects fall under gravity, they undergo uniformly accelerated motion. Oh wait, right, the acceleration due to gravity is g, which is about 9.8 m/s².

The question says the object is released from rest, so initial velocity u is zero. It falls a distance h in the first second. I need to find out how far it falls in the next second, which would be the second second. 

Wait, so the first second is from t=0 to t=1. In that time, the distance fallen is h. I think I should use the equation of motion for distance under constant acceleration. The equation is s = ut + (1/2)at². Since u is zero, s = (1/2)gt². 

So for the first second, t=1, s = h. Let me plug that in. h = 0.5 * g * (1)^2. So h = g/2. Oh wait, but wait, that's if g is 9.8, then h would be about 4.9 m. But the actual value of g doesn't matter here because we're dealing in terms of h.

But the question is about the next second. That's from t=1 to t=2. So I need to find the distance fallen during that interval. The total distance fallen in 2 seconds would be s_total = 0.5 * g * (2)^2 = 2g. Wait no, because s is h for t=1, so perhaps using h to express it differently.

Wait, maybe I should find the distance fallen in the first second as h, then the distance in the next second is the total at 2 seconds minus the distance at 1 second.

So, s(2) = 0.5 * g * (2)^2 = 0.5 * g *4 = 2g. And s(1)=0.5 g (1)^2= 0.5 g. So the distance fallen in the second second is s(2) - s(1) = 2g -0.5g = 1.5g. But wait, since h is 0.5g, then 1.5g is 3h. Because h =0.5g, so 1.5g is 3h. So the answer would be 3h, which is option H.

Wait, let me make sure. So the first second: h = (1/2) g (1)^2 → h = g/2. So g=2h. Then the second second: s(2) = (1/2) g (2)^2 = (1/2)(4g) = 2g. But since g is 2h, s(2)= 2*(2h)=4h. The distance in the first second is h, so the second second is 4h - h =3h. So yes, the next second the object falls 3h distance.

So the correct answer should be H:3h.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of an object under constant acceleration due to gravity. The object is released from rest, so its initial velocity \( u = 0 \). The distance fallen under gravity is given by the equation:

\[
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}gt^2
\]

Since \( u = 0 \), the equation simplifies to:

\[
s = \frac{1}{2}gt^2
\]

For the first second (\( t = 1 \)), the distance fallen is \( h \). Substituting \( t = 1 \) into the equation:

\[
h = \frac{1}{2}g(1)^2 \implies h = \frac{g}{2}
\]

This implies \( g = 2h \).

Next, we calculate the total distance fallen in 2 seconds (\( t = 2 \)):

\[
s(2) = \frac{1}{2}g(2)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(4g) = 2g
\]

Substituting \( g = 2h \):

\[
s(2) = 2(2h) = 4h
\]

The distance fallen during the second second is the difference between the total distance at \( t = 2 \) and \( t = 1 \):

\[
\text{Distance in the second second} = s(2) - s(1) = 4h - h = 3h
\]

Thus, the object falls \( 3h \) during the next second. The correct answer is:

H: 3h
