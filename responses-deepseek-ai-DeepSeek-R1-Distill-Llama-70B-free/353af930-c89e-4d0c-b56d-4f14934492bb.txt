Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Ross's prima facie duties. I remember that Ross was a philosopher who talked about ethics, specifically about duties. Prima facie duties, if I recall correctly, are like obligations that we have, but they can sometimes come into conflict with each other.

The question is asking what Ross said about these duties. The options are A through I, each making a different claim. Let me think about what I remember about Ross's theory. I think he was part of the intuitionist school, so he believed that certain moral principles are self-evident. Like, you can just know them through reason or intuition, not through some kind of empirical evidence.

Looking at the options, option I says "are self-evident." That sounds familiar. Ross probably argued that these duties are self-evident because he was an intuitionist. So, people can understand these duties without needing proof or evidence; they're just apparent.

Now, let me go through the other options to make sure. Option A says they're only applicable to certain cultures. I don't think that's right because Ross's view was more about objective duties that apply universally, not just specific cultures. Option B says determined by societal norms, which doesn't fit because societal norms can vary, but Ross was more about objective moral truths. Option C, only valid if they align with personal beliefs, that doesn't make sense because duties should be more about objective right and wrong, not personal belief. Option D, no moral significance, that's the opposite of what Ross would say because he's all about moral duties. Option E, can be altered over time, but I think Ross saw them as more fixed. Option F, can be proven, but I think because they're self-evident, they don't need proof. Option G, cannot be known, which is wrong because if they're self-evident, they can be known. Option H, not objective, which contradicts Ross's view that they are objective. 

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be I: are self-evident.

Ross's theory of prima facie duties aligns with ethical intuitionism, emphasizing that these duties are self-evident and knowable through reason or intuition. Among the options, I correctly captures this concept.

Answer: I
