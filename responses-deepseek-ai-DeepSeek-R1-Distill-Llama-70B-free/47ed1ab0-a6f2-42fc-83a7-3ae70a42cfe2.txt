Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about comparing the costs of two types of life insurance policies: a 20-year endowment policy and a 20-year limited payment policy, both purchased at age 45. The question is asking me to figure out which option correctly reflects their cost comparison. The options are from A to J, with various dollar amounts.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my life insurance policies, but I'll try to think this through. Let's start by recalling what each type of policy entails.

First, a 20-year endowment policy. I remember that endowment policies are a type of life insurance that combines a death benefit with a savings component. They're usually more expensive because part of the premium goes into an investment or savings portion. The policy pays out either upon death or if the policy matures (in this case, after 20 years). So if the insured lives beyond 20 years, they receive the endowment amount.

On the other hand, a limited payment policy, sometimes called a limited pay life insurance, means that the policyholder pays premiums for a limited period, which is typically shorter than the policy's term. In this case, it's a 20-year limited payment policy, so the payments might be made for, say, 10 or 20 years, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, wait—no, wait. Actually, I think for limited payment, the payment period is shorter than the policy term. For example, a 20-year policy where you pay premiums for 10 years. But the question says it's a 20-year limited payment, so maybe the payments are spread over the entire 20 years but structured differently. Or perhaps the payments stop at some point before the 20 years are up. I need to clarify that.

Wait, no. I think there's another type called "limited pay" where you pay higher premiums for a shorter period. For example, a 20-year policy where you pay for 10 years. The idea is that after those 10 years, the policy is paid up, and you have coverage for the remaining 10 years without paying more premiums. But in this case, the question says both are 20-year policies. So perhaps the 20-year limited payment policy is just that: you pay for the entire 20 years, but the structure is different from the endowment.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with "limited pay" versus "ordinary life." Let me think again. Endowment policies are a type of ordinary life (whole life) insurance, but they have a maturity date. So, for a 20-year endowment, if you live 20 years, you get the payout. The premiums are higher because of the savings element.

Limited payment policies, I think, are more akin to term life insurance but with a twist. Wait, no, term life usually has lower premiums and doesn't build cash value. Wait, no—limited payment might refer to how the premiums are structured. For example, in a limited payment whole life policy, you pay higher premiums for a certain number of years, and then the policy is paid up. But that's a form of whole life, not term. So perhaps in this case, the 20-year limited payment policy is a type of term insurance where the premiums are higher but only paid for a certain period.

Alternatively, maybe both policies are whole life, but the endowment has a higher premium because of the endowment payout. Wait, but the question is comparing a 20-year endowment to a 20-year limited payment policy. So they're both 20-year policies but with different payment structures.

Wait, perhaps the endowment policy is a type of term life with an endowment feature, whereas the limited payment might be a whole life where you pay for a limited time. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently.

I think the key here is to understand that endowment policies typically have higher premiums than limited payment policies because of the guaranteed payout at the end of the term. So, the endowment policy would have higher premiums, while the limited payment policy might have lower premiums because you're just paying for the death benefit without the savings component.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the limited payment policy requires you to pay higher premiums for a shorter period, making the overall cost lower in some way. Or maybe the opposite. Let me think: for a limited payment whole life policy, you pay higher premiums for a set number of years (like 20 years), and then the policy is fully paid. But in this case, the policy is 20 years, so perhaps the limited payment means you pay for the entire 20 years but at a different rate than the endowment.

Alternatively, maybe the endowment has higher premiums because it's building up a cash value that will be paid out at the end, whereas the limited payment policy is structured so that you pay only for the death benefit, hence lower premiums.

Wait, but in that case, the limited payment policy would have lower premiums than the endowment. So the question is comparing the costs (I assume the annual or monthly premiums) of the two policies. The endowment would have higher premiums because of the savings element.

So if I'm to compare the two, the endowment policy would be more expensive than the limited payment. So the cost of the endowment would be higher than the limited payment policy.

Looking at the options, I need to see which one reflects this. But the options provided are single numbers, and I'm not sure if the question is asking for which policy is cheaper or by how much. Wait, the question says "Compare the costs... if each were to be purchased at age 45." So perhaps the question is about the difference in premiums. Alternatively, it's about which policy has a lower cost, implying a lower premium.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact question. Let me read it again: "Compare the costs of a $5,000 20-year endowment policy with a $5,000 20-year limited payment policy if each were to be purchased at age 45." So the question is about which of the options represents the correct comparison. The options are all specific amounts, so perhaps it's the difference in their monthly or annual premiums.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking which one is cheaper, and which option matches that.

Wait, but without specific numbers, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about how premiums are calculated.

Endowment policies have higher premiums because they provide a maturity value. So for the same death benefit, an endowment policy would cost more than a limited payment term policy, perhaps.

Wait, but limited payment could refer to how the premiums are paid, not necessarily the type. For example, a limited payment whole life policy might have higher premiums for a shorter period.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think in terms of the policy types.

Endowment policy: It's a savings-oriented policy. The premiums are higher, and at the end of the term (20 years), you get a payout if you're alive.

Limited payment policy: This could be a type of term life where you pay for a certain period, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, it could be a whole life policy where you pay premiums for a limited time, like 20 years, and then it's paid up.

Wait, but if both are 20-year policies, then perhaps the limited payment policy is a term life where you pay for the entire 20 years, but at a lower cost than the endowment because there's no cash value.

Alternatively, maybe the endowment is a type of whole life, and the limited payment is a term life, which would have lower premiums.

So, if both are $5,000 death benefit, 20-year term, then the endowment would have higher premiums because it includes the savings element. The limited payment policy would have lower premiums because it's just term life.

So, comparing the costs, the endowment would be more expensive. So the answer would be the one where the endowment is more expensive than the limited payment. So the cost of the endowment minus the limited payment would be a positive number, but the question is which option represents the correct cost comparison.

Wait, but the options are single values. So perhaps the question is asking which policy has the lower cost. So the limited payment would have lower premiums, so the cost (premium) would be lower.

Looking at the options, which are all different. So perhaps the correct answer is the one with the lower value, implying lower premiums for the limited payment.

Wait, but without knowing which is which, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the annual or monthly premium for each, and the options are possible premium amounts.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the premiums for both policies using some formulas, but I don't have the interest rates or mortality tables, so that's not feasible.

Alternatively, I can think logically: endowment policies have higher premiums because they not only cover the death benefit but also accumulate a cash value. So for the same face amount, the endowment would have higher premiums than a term life policy. But the limited payment policy could be a term life, so its premiums would be lower.

So, if the question is comparing the costs, the limited payment policy would have lower costs. So looking at the options, the answer would be a lower number.

Looking at the options, the lower numbers are F ($99.99), G ($46.67), I ($75.50), J ($50.90).

Wait, but I'm not sure if the question is asking for which policy is cheaper, but the way the question is phrased, it's comparing the costs, so perhaps it's the difference between the two. Alternatively, perhaps it's the premium of one versus the other.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking which of the options is the correct cost of one of the policies. But without knowing which, it's tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about which policy would have a higher or lower cost. For example, which policy's premium is higher.

Wait, but the options are individual amounts, so perhaps the correct answer is that the endowment policy's cost is higher than the limited payment. So the correct option would be the higher number. Let's see the options:

A: 182.45

B: 125.75

C: 233.35

D: 300.20

E: 160.65

F: 99.99

G:46.67

H:210.10

I:75.50

J:50.90

If the endowment is more expensive, then the higher numbers are for the endowment. So the limited payment would have lower numbers.

But the question is comparing the costs of both policies. So perhaps the answer is that the endowment costs more, so the correct option would be one of the higher numbers, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total cost over 20 years. The endowment policy would have higher total premiums because each premium is higher. So the total cost would be higher for the endowment.

But without specific data, it's hard to calculate. Maybe the question is more about understanding that endowments have higher costs than term life policies.

So, if the options are the monthly or annual premiums, the endowment would have a higher value. Among the options, the highest are D ($300.20), C ($233.35), etc.

Wait, but perhaps the limited payment policy is more expensive. No, that doesn't make sense. Limited payment policies typically have higher premiums for a shorter payment period to build up the cash value quicker. But in this case, both are 20-year policies, so perhaps the limited payment is structured so that you pay more each year but for fewer years.

Wait, no, the question says both are 20-year policies. So the limited payment policy might require paying for the entire 20 years, but at a lower rate than the endowment. Alternatively, maybe the limited payment is for a shorter period, but the policy lasts 20 years.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. Maybe the question is about which policy has a lower premium. Since endowments are more expensive, the limited payment policy would have a lower cost. So the correct answer would be the lower number.

Looking at the options, the lower ones are G ($46.67), J ($50.90), I ($75.50), F ($99.99), etc.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the limited payment policy has higher premiums because you're paying more up front. Wait, that depends on the type. If it's a limited pay whole life, you might pay more for a shorter period, but if it's a 20-year limited pay, perhaps you pay for 20 years with higher premiums than term life.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should try to think of it this way: endowment policies are more expensive than term life because they have a savings component. So if the limited payment policy is a term life, its premiums would be lower than the endowment's.

So, when comparing the two, the endowment's cost is higher. So the correct answer would be the higher number.

But without knowing which option corresponds to which policy, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking which option correctly represents the cost of one of the policies, but without more info, it's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it in terms of the policy types. An endowment policy is a type of whole life insurance, so it's more expensive. A limited payment policy might be a term life, which is cheaper.

So, the endowment would have higher premiums. So, looking for a higher option. The options for higher ones are A, C, D, H.

If the question is about the cost of the endowment, then the correct answer would be a higher number. But if it's about the limited payment, then a lower number.

But the question is comparing the two. So perhaps the answer is the difference between the two. Hmm, but without knowing the actual premiums, can't calculate.

Alternatively, maybe the question is testing knowledge that limited payment policies have lower premiums. So the cost of the limited payment is lower, so the correct option would be a lower number.

But I'm not entirely sure. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option E: $160.65 or option I: $75.50. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: The endowment policy's premium includes both the death benefit and the savings, so it's higher. The limited payment policy, perhaps, is a term policy, so lower. So the endowment's cost is higher. So the correct answer would be a higher number.

Looking at the options, the highest is D ($300.20), then C ($233.35), then A (182.45), H (210.10), etc.

But without knowing the exact context, it's hard to pick. Maybe the answer is option C or A.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that endowments have higher premiums. So the cost of the endowment is higher, so the correct answer would be the higher number. So the options are:

A: 182.45

C:233.35

H:210.10

So, which is higher? 233 is higher than 182 and 210.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the annual premium. But without more data, I can't compute it.

Wait, another thought: The endowment policy would have a higher premium because it's a whole life policy with a maturity date. The limited payment policy is probably a term life with a death benefit only, so lower premiums.

So, the endowment's cost is higher. So the correct answer would be the higher value. So from the options, perhaps the highest is D: $300.20. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the limited payment is cheaper, so the correct answer would be a lower option.

Wait, I'm going in circles. Maybe I should make an educated guess. Since endowments are more expensive, the cost of the endowment would be higher than the limited payment's. So the correct answer would be a higher number. Looking at the options, the higher ones are D ($300.20), C ($233.35), H ($210.10), A ($182.45).

But without knowing the exact premiums, it's hard to say which one is correct. Maybe the answer is option C: $233.35.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: $160.65, as it's a moderate number, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the limited payment policy might have a slightly lower or similar premium. But I'm not making progress here. I think I'll have to go with the reasoning that the endowment has higher costs, so the correct answer is a higher number. Among the options, I'll pick option C: $233.35.

The question compares the costs of a $5,000 20-year endowment policy and a $5,000 20-year limited payment policy purchased at age 45. Endowment policies typically have higher premiums because they include a savings component, which results in a payout at the end of the term (20 years in this case). Limited payment policies, on the other hand, are often structured to be more cost-effective, as they may focus solely on the death benefit without the additional savings element.

Given this, the endowment policy is expected to have higher premiums than the limited payment policy. The options provided are single values, and the reasoning suggests that the endowment policy would correspond to a higher number. Among the options, the higher values are A ($182.45), C ($233.35), H ($210.10), and D ($300.20). Based on the logic that the endowment policy is more expensive, the most plausible answer is **C: $233.35**, as it represents a higher cost consistent with the characteristics of an endowment policy.
