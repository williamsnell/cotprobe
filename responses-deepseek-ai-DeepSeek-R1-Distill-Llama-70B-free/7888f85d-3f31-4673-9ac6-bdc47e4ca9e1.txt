Okay, so I have this question about impedance matching using a quarter-wave transformer. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The problem says a signal source at 50MHz has an output impedance of 20 ohms. It's connected through a coaxial line to a load impedance of 150 + j40 ohms. The question is whether a quarter-wave transformer can match the source to the load.

Wait, I remember that a quarter-wave transformer is used to match two impedances. The basic idea is that when you have a transmission line that's a quarter wavelength long, it can transform the impedance seen at the load into something else, depending on its characteristic impedance.

The formula I think is Z0 = sqrt(Z_source * Z_load), but wait, is that right? Or is it Z0 squared equals Z_source times Z_load? Oh right, yes, the characteristic impedance of the transformer should be the geometric mean of the source and load impedances. So Z0 would be sqrt(20 * 150) because the source is 20 and load is 150 ohms. Wait, but wait, the load is complex here, 150 +j40. Does that matter?

Oh, right, the quarter-wave transformer works perfectly when the load is real. If the load has a reactive component (like the j40 here), then even with the transformer, the impedance might not be perfectly matched because the transformer only transforms the real part. So the problem is that the load isn't purely real; it's complex.

So let me think. The transformer would match the real parts. Let's say we design the transformer for the real part of the load. So Z0 would be sqrt(20 * 150) = sqrt(3000) which is about 54.77 ohms. But wait, the load isn't just 150 ohms; there's a j40 too. So when the transformer is applied, it would transform the complex load into something else.

Wait, the quarter-wave transformer transforms the load impedance. The formula for the transformed impedance is Z_transformed = (Z0^2) / Z_load. But Z_load is complex here, so Z_transformed would also be complex. That would mean the source doesn't see a purely real impedance, so there's still a mismatch. So the transformer alone can't make the impedance purely real if the load has a reactive component.

Looking at the options:

Option A says a 100-ohm transformer can match. But 100 isn't sqrt(20*150), which is around 54.77. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says the transformer's impedance is sqrt(20*150)=54.77. That would match the real part, but since the load has a reactive component, it won't result in a purely real impedance at the source. So the matching isn't perfect. So B is a possible correct choice, but the question is whether it can provide perfect matching.

Option C is sqrt(50*150). Wait, the source impedance is 20, not 50. So C is incorrect.

Option D says a quarter-wave transformer cannot provide perfect impedance matching. Since the load is complex, the transformer can't make it real, so D might be correct.

Option E says no transformer is needed because they're matched. No, 20 is not 150, so E is wrong.

Option F suggests adding a series inductor to make the load real. That's another approach besides the transformer. But the question is about whether the transformer alone can do it. So F is about a different solution, but the question is about the transformer.

Option G says the transformer can provide perfect matching. But since the load has a reactive part, it's not possible. So G is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be either D or B. Wait, the question is whether it's possible to design a quarter-wave transformer to match the source to the load. Since the load is complex, the transformer can't match it perfectly because it leaves a reactive component. So the correct answer would be D: a quarter-wave transformer cannot provide perfect impedance matching.

Wait another thought. Let me think more about the theory. The quarter-wave transformer can match any real impedance to another real impedance. But if the load is complex, the transformer will match it to another complex impedance. So for perfect matching, the transformed impedance must be equal to the source's impedance. So let's model it.

The transformed impedance Zin would be (Z0^2) / (R_load + jX_load). For Zin to be real and equal to the source impedance (20 ohms), the imaginary part must be zero.

So let's compute (Z0^2) / (150 +j40). For this to be real, the denominator must be such that the result is real. So Z0^2 must be a complex number that when divided into gives real. But Z0 is real (the line's characteristic impedance is real). So (Z0^2) is real, and dividing by a complex number would result in a complex number. Hence, Zin would have an imaginary part, which can't be matched to the real source impedance.

Therefore, the quarter-wave transformer can't provide perfect matching here because the load isn't purely resistive. So the correct answer is D.

To determine whether a quarter-wave transformer can match the source to the load, we analyze the given impedances and the capabilities of a quarter-wave transformer. The source impedance is 20 ohms, and the load impedance is complex: \( 150 + j40 \, \Omega \). A quarter-wave transformer can match two impedances if the load is purely real. However, when the load has a reactive component (as in this case), the transformer alone cannot provide perfect impedance matching because it cannot eliminate the reactive part of the impedance.

The characteristic impedance of the transformer, \( Z_0 \), is typically chosen as the geometric mean of the source and load impedances: 

\[
Z_0 = \sqrt{Z_{\text{source}} \cdot Z_{\text{load}}}.
\]

For the given impedances, this would be:

\[
Z_0 = \sqrt{20 \cdot 150} = \sqrt{3000} \approx 54.77 \, \Omega.
\]

However, even with this choice of \( Z_0 \), the transformed impedance at the source would still include a reactive component due to the \( j40 \, \Omega \) in the load. This means the impedance seen by the source would not be purely real, and perfect matching would not be achieved.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A:** Incorrect. A transformer with \( Z_0 = 100 \, \Omega \) does not match the geometric mean of the source and load impedances (\( \sqrt{20 \cdot 150} \approx 54.77 \, \Omega \)).
- **Option B:** Incorrect. While \( Z_0 = \sqrt{20 \cdot 150} \approx 54.77 \, \Omega \) is the correct choice for the transformer's characteristic impedance, it cannot provide perfect matching because the load has a reactive component.
- **Option C:** Incorrect. The source impedance is 20 ohms, not 50 ohms, so \( Z_0 = \sqrt{50 \cdot 150} \) is irrelevant.
- **Option D:** Correct. A quarter-wave transformer cannot provide perfect impedance matching when the load is complex because it cannot eliminate the reactive component.
- **Option E:** Incorrect. The source and load impedances are not already matched, as \( 20 \, \Omega \neq 150 + j40 \, \Omega \).
- **Option F:** Irrelevant. While adding a series inductor could make the load impedance real, the question asks specifically about the quarter-wave transformer.
- **Option G:** Incorrect. A quarter-wave transformer cannot provide perfect matching in this case due to the reactive component of the load.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **D**, as a quarter-wave transformer cannot provide perfect impedance matching when the load is complex.
