Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about solubility. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question says that a chemist dissolves PbS in water, and the Ksp is 1e-28. I need to find the molarity of each ion in solution.

Hmm, I remember that Ksp is the solubility product, right? So for a salt like PbS, which dissociates into Pb²+ and S²- ions. The dissolution reaction should be PbS(s) ⇌ Pb²+(aq) + S²−(aq). 

Wait, yes, because lead (Pb) typically has a +2 charge, and sulfide (S) is -2. So each formula unit of PbS gives one Pb²+ and one S²- ion.

The solubility product expression for this would be Ksp = [Pb²+][S²-]. Since the stoichiometry is 1:1, the concentrations of the two ions should be the same. Let's call each concentration 's' (for solubility). So Ksp = s * s = s².

Given that Ksp is 1e-28, setting that equal to s squared: s² = 1e-28. To find s, take the square root of both sides. So s = sqrt(1e-28) = 1e-14. 

Wait, because sqrt(1e-28) is 1e-14, right? Because (1e-14)^2 is 1e-28. So each ion's concentration is 1e-14 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-14 M. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check. PbS dissociates into two ions with a 1:1 ratio, so their concentrations are equal. Ksp is 1e-28, so yes, each is sqrt(1e-28) = 1e-14. 

I don't think I made a mistake here. None of the other options make sense in this case. So the correct choice should be C.

To determine the molarity of each ion in the solution, we start with the dissociation of PbS in water: 

\[
\text{PbS(s)} \leftrightharpoons \text{Pb}^{2+}\text{(aq)} + \text{S}^{2-}\text{(aq)}.
\]

The solubility product constant (\(K_{sp}\)) is given as \(1 \times 10^{-28}\), and the expression for \(K_{sp}\) is:

\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Pb}^{2+}][\text{S}^{2-}].
\]

Since the stoichiometry of the dissociation is 1:1, the concentrations of \(\text{Pb}^{2+}\) and \(\text{S}^{2-}\) are equal. Let the molarity of each ion be \(s\). Thus:

\[
K_{sp} = s^2.
\]

Substituting \(K_{sp} = 1 \times 10^{-28}\):

\[
s^2 = 1 \times 10^{-28}.
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
s = \sqrt{1 \times 10^{-28}} = 1 \times 10^{-14}.
\]

Therefore, the molarity of each ion (\(\text{Pb}^{2+}\) and \(\text{S}^{2-}\)) in solution is \(1 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{M}\).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: \(1 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{M}\).**
