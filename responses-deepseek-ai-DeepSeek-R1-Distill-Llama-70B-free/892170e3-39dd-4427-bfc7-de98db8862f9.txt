Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem to solve. The question is asking me to find the value of b given that log base b of 343 equals -3/2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on logarithms, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the logarithmic equation log_b(a) = c means that b raised to the power of c equals a. So in this case, log_b(343) = -3/2 would translate to b^(-3/2) = 343. Wait, that makes sense because logarithms and exponents are inverses of each other.

So, the equation I get is b^(-3/2) = 343. Now, I need to solve for b. Exponents with negative powers mean reciprocals, right? So b^(-3/2) is the same as 1/(b^(3/2)). So the equation becomes 1/(b^(3/2)) = 343.

Hmm, maybe it's easier if I rewrite this in a positive exponent form. Let me take the reciprocal of both sides. That would give me b^(3/2) = 1/343. Oh, because flipping both sides gives me (1/(b^(3/2))) = 343 â†’ b^(3/2) = 1/343.

Now, I need to solve for b. The exponent here is 3/2, which is the same as taking the square root and then cubing, or the other way around. Let me think: b^(3/2) is the same as (b^(1/2))^3. Alternatively, it's the same as (b^3)^(1/2). Either way, I can solve for b by getting rid of the exponent 3/2.

So, to isolate b, I can raise both sides of the equation to the power of 2/3. Because (b^(3/2))^(2/3) would just be b^(1) = b. So let's do that.

Taking both sides to the 2/3 power: (b^(3/2))^(2/3) = (1/343)^(2/3). On the left side, the exponents multiply, so (3/2)*(2/3) = 1, which gives just b. So the left side simplifies to b.

On the right side, (1/343)^(2/3) is the same as [(1/343)^(1/3)]^2. Alternatively, I can think of it as the cube root of (1/343) squared. Let's compute that.

First, what's the cube root of 343? I remember that 7 cubed is 343 because 7*7=49, 49*7=343. So the cube root of 343 is 7. Therefore, the cube root of 1/343 is 1/7, because (1/7)^3 = 1/343.

So now, (1/343)^(1/3) is 1/7. Then I square that, so (1/7)^2 is 1/49. So putting that together, b = (1/343)^(2/3) = (1/7)^2 = 1/49.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake with the exponents. So starting again, we have b^(3/2) = 1/343. Taking both sides to the 2/3 power gives b = (1/343)^(2/3).

Alternatively, maybe I can express 343 as 7^3, which it is. So 1/343 is 7^(-3). So substituting that into the equation gives b = (7^(-3))^(2/3). Exponents multiply, so -3*(2/3) is -2. So b = 7^(-2) = 1/(7^2) = 1/49. Yep, that's the same result as before.

So the value of b is 1/49. Now, looking at the options provided:

Options:

A: 1

B: 1/49

C: 1/7

D: -3

E: -1/7

F:7

G:3

H:-1/49

I:-7

J:49

So the correct answer would be option B, which is 1/49.
</think>

To solve for \( b \) in the equation \(\log_{b}(343) = -\frac{3}{2}\), we start by converting the logarithmic equation to its exponential form. This gives:

\[
b^{-\frac{3}{2}} = 343
\]

Rewriting \( b^{-\frac{3}{2}} \) as \(\frac{1}{b^{\frac{3}{2}}}\), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{b^{\frac{3}{2}}} = 343
\]

Taking the reciprocal of both sides:

\[
b^{\frac{3}{2}} = \frac{1}{343}
\]

To isolate \( b \), we raise both sides of the equation to the power of \(\frac{2}{3}\):

\[
\left(b^{\frac{3}{2}}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}} = \left(\frac{1}{343}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
b = \left(\frac{1}{343}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}
\]

Now, note that \( 343 = 7^3 \), so:

\[
\frac{1}{343} = 7^{-3}
\]

Substituting this into the equation:

\[
b = \left(7^{-3}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}
\]

When raising a power to another power, the exponents multiply:

\[
b = 7^{-3 \cdot \frac{2}{3}} = 7^{-2} = \frac{1}{7^2} = \frac{1}{49}
\]

Thus, the value of \( b \) is \(\frac{1}{49}\), which corresponds to option **B**.
