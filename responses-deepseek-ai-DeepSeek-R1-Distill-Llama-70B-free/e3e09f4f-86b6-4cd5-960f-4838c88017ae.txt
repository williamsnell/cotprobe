Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about heat exchange between two black plates. Hmm, I remember that black bodies radiate heat based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula for the power radiated is sigma times area times the temperature to the fourth power, right? Oh wait, but wait, the two objects are at different temperatures, so I think the net heat exchange is the difference between the two.

Wait, the question says the plates are initially at 100°F and 200°F. Then they raise the second plate's temperature to 400°F. I need to find the increase in heat exchange.

Wait, but Fahrenheit? Oh, right, because the Stefan-Boltzmann law uses absolute temperatures, so I need to convert Fahrenheit to Rankine. Oh right, because Kelvin and Rankine are absolute scales. So to convert Fahrenheit to Rankine, I think it's °R = °F + 459.67.

So initial temperatures:
First plate: 100°F = 100 + 459.67 = 559.67 °R
Second plate: 200°F = 200 + 459.67 = 659.67 °R

After the change, the second plate is at 400°F which is 400 + 459.67 = 859.67 °R.

The heat exchange per unit area (since they're parallel and infinite, edge effects are negligible) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law for each plate, and the net is the difference. So the initial heat exchange would be sigma*(T2^4 - T1^4), where T is in Rankine.

Wait, but the formula for the net radiative heat flux between two black bodies is q = sigma*(T2^4 - T1^4). Because each body emits based on its temperature, and the net is the difference.

So the initial heat exchange per unit area is sigma*( (659.67)^4 - (559.67)^4 ). Then after the change, it's sigma*( (859.67)^4 - (559.67)^4 ). The increase is the difference between these two.

So the increase in heat exchange is sigma * [ (859.67^4 - 559.67^4) - (659.67^4 - 559.67^4) ) ].

Wait, that simplifies to sigma * (859.67^4 - 659.67^4).

Because the 559.67^4 terms cancel out.

So let me compute that.

First, compute (859.67)^4 and (659.67)^4.

But wait, those numbers are a bit big. Maybe I can compute each term step by step.

Alternatively, I can compute the fourth power of each and subtract.

Wait, but perhaps I can factor it as a difference of squares, but not sure if that's helpful here. Let's just compute each term.

But I'm not going to compute exact numbers by hand; I should think about how to approach this.

Alternatively, since the options are given, maybe I can compute the initial and final flux and subtract.

Wait, the initial flux:

q_initial = sigma * (T2_initial^4 - T1_initial^4)
= 0.1714e-8 * (659.67^4 - 559.67^4)

The final flux:

q_final = sigma * (859.67^4 - 559.67^4)

The increase is q_final - q_initial = sigma * [ (859.67^4 - 559.67^4) - (659.67^4 - 559.67^4) ) ]
= sigma * (859.67^4 - 659.67^4 )

So the increase is sigma multiplied by (859.67^4 - 659.67^4 )

Now, I need to compute 859.67^4 and 659.67^4.

But wait, I'll need to compute these values. Maybe I can find an approximate way to compute these, but perhaps it's easier to use a calculator approach.

Wait, let's compute each term:

First, 859.67 in Rankine. Let's compute 859.67^4.

Wait, 859.67 is approximately 860. Let's compute 860^4.

Wait, 860^2 is 860*860 = Let's compute 800^2 = 640000, 60^2=3600, and cross terms 2*800*60=96000.

So (800+60)^2= 800^2 + 2*800*60 + 60^2 = 640000 + 96000 + 3600 = 739600.

Then 860^4 is (739600)^2.

Wait, that's a big number. 739600 squared:

Let me compute 7396 * 7396.

Wait, 7000^2 is 49,000,000. 396^2 is about 156,816. Then the cross terms would be 2*7000*396 = 5,544,000.

So (7000 + 396)^2 = 7000² + 2*7000*396 + 396² = 49,000,000 + 5,544,000 + 156,816 = 54,700,816.

Wait wait, but wait, 7396 is 7.396e3, so 7396^2 = (7.396e3)^2 = 54,700,816e0? Wait, no, it's (7.396e3)^2 = (7.396)^2 * 1e6.

7.396^2 = approx 54.7 (exact would be 7^2=49, 0.396^2≈0.157, 2*7*0.396=5.544 → 49 +5.544=54.544 + 0.157≈54.701). So 54.701 *1e6 = 54,701,000.

So 860^4 is 54,701,000 (approx).

Wait, wait, but that was 7396^2, which is 860^2 squared, which is 860^4. So 860^4 ≈ 54,701,000 (but it's more precise to say 54,700,816, but perhaps I should use exact numbers or better approximations.)

Wait, but perhaps I can find a better way. Let me try to compute 859.67^4 and 659.67^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact values with exponents.

Wait, let me compute each term step by step.

First, let me compute 859.67^4:

Compute 859.67^2 first.

859.67 * 859.67.

Hmm, 800 * 800 = 640000.

800 * 59.67 = 47,736.

59.67 * 800 = same as above, 47,736.

59.67 * 59.67 ≈ 3,560 (exact: 59^2=3481, 0.67^2≈0.45, cross term 2*59*0.67 ≈ 79.06 → 3481 +79.06=3560.06 + 0.45=3560.51).

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me think: 859.67 is approximately 860. So 860^2 is 739,600. Let's go with that.

So (859.67)^2 ≈ (860)^2 = 739600.

Then (859.67)^4 = (739600)^2.

Now, 739600 squared: 7396 * 10^2 squared = (7396)^2 * 10^4.

7396 squared: I can compute 7400^2 = 54,760,000. Then subtract 4*(7400) + 4^2 → Wait, 7396 = 7400 -4.

So (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b².

So (7400-4)^2 = 7400² - 2*7400*4 +4² = 54,760,000 - 59,200 + 16 = 54,760,000 - 59,200 = 54,700,800 +16=54,700,816.

So (7396)^2 = 54,700,816. Then (739600)^2 = (7396 * 100)^2 = 54,700,816 * 10,000 = 547,008,160,000.

Wait, 54,700,816 * 10^4 = 547,008,160,000.

So 859.67^4 ≈ 5.4700816e11.

Wait, 547,008,160,000 is 5.4700816e11.

Similarly, compute 659.67^4.

Again, 659.67 is approximately 660. 660^2 = 435,600.

Then 435,600 squared is 4356^2 * 10^4.

4356^2 = Let's compute 4300^2 = 18,490,000; 56^2=3,136; cross term 2*4300*56= 482,400.

So (4300+56)^2 = 4300² + 2*4300*56 +56² = 18,490,000 + 482,400 +3,136 = 18,490,000 + 485,536 = 18,975,536.

So 4356^2 = 18,975,536. Then 435,600^2 = (4356 * 100)^2 = 18,975,536 * 10^4 = 189,755,360,000.

So 659.67^4 ≈ 1.8975536e11.

So now, the difference is (5.4700816e11 - 1.8975536e11) = 3.572528e11.

Wait, 5.4700816e11 = 547,008,160,000

1.8975536e11 = 189,755,360,000

Subtracting: 547,008,160,000 - 189,755,360,000 = 357,252,800,000 → 3.572528e11.

So the increase in heat exchange per unit area is sigma multiplied by this difference.

Sigma is given as 0.1714e-8 Btu/hr-ft^2-°R^4.

So:

Increase = sigma * (T2_new^4 - T1_initial^4 - (T2_initial^4 - T1_initial^4)) )

Wait, no, as I simplified earlier, the increase is sigma*(859.67^4 - 659.67^4).

Which is sigma * 3.572528e11.

So let's compute:

0.1714e-8 * 3.572528e11.

Multiply 0.1714e-8 by 3.572528e11.

First, multiply the coefficients: 0.1714 * 3.572528.

Let me compute that.

0.1714 * 3.572528.

Hmm, 0.1 * 3.572528 = 0.3572528

0.07 * 3.572528 = 0.25007696

0.0014 *3.572528 ≈ 0.0049995.

So adding those: 0.3572528 + 0.25007696 = 0.60732976 + 0.0049995 ≈ 0.612329.

So approximately 0.6123.

Now, the exponents: 1e-8 * 1e11 = 1e3.

So 0.6123 * 1e3 = 612.3.

So the increase is approximately 612.3 Btu/hr-ft².

Looking at the options, option F is 612 Btu/hr-ft².

So the answer should be F.

To determine the increase in heat exchange between two infinite black parallel plates, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The net radiative heat flux between two black bodies is given by:

\[
q = \sigma \left( T_2^4 - T_1^4 \right)
\]

where \( \sigma = 0.1714 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^2\text{-°R}^4 \), \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are the absolute temperatures of the plates in Rankine, and the increase in heat exchange is:

\[
\Delta q = \sigma \left( T_{2,\text{new}}^4 - T_{2,\text{initial}}^4 \right)
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Rankine
The initial and final temperatures are given in Fahrenheit, so we convert them to Rankine using \( T_{\text{R}} = T_{\text{F}} + 459.67 \):

- Initial temperatures:
  - \( T_{1,\text{initial}} = 100 + 459.67 = 559.67 \, \text{°R} \)
  - \( T_{2,\text{initial}} = 200 + 459.67 = 659.67 \, \text{°R} \)

- Final temperature of the second plate:
  - \( T_{2,\text{new}} = 400 + 459.67 = 859.67 \, \text{°R} \)

### Step 2: Compute \( T_{2,\text{new}}^4 \) and \( T_{2,\text{initial}}^4 \)
Using approximations for simplicity:

- \( T_{2,\text{new}}^4 \approx 859.67^4 \approx 5.4700816 \times 10^{11} \)
- \( T_{2,\text{initial}}^4 \approx 659.67^4 \approx 1.8975536 \times 10^{11} \)

The difference is:

\[
T_{2,\text{new}}^4 - T_{2,\text{initial}}^4 \approx 5.4700816 \times 10^{11} - 1.8975536 \times 10^{11} = 3.572528 \times 10^{11}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the increase in heat exchange
The increase in heat exchange per unit area is:

\[
\Delta q = \sigma \left( T_{2,\text{new}}^4 - T_{2,\text{initial}}^4 \right)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta q = 0.1714 \times 10^{-8} \times 3.572528 \times 10^{11}
\]

First, compute the coefficient:

\[
0.1714 \times 3.572528 \approx 0.6123
\]

Then, adjust for the powers of 10:

\[
\Delta q = 0.6123 \times 10^3 = 612.3 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^2
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The closest option to \( 612.3 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^2 \) is:

**F: 612 Btu/hr-ft²**

ANSWER: F
