Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about research on women who have had abortions. I'm not entirely sure about all the details, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what research indicates about the effects of abortion on women. The options are A through J, each making a different claim. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Most women regret their decision immediately after the procedure. I don't think that's right. From what I remember, most women feel relief after an abortion, though some might have mixed emotions. Regret being immediate and common doesn't sound accurate.

Option B: The experience frequently has serious psychological consequences like guilt and depression. I'm a bit unsure here. I think there's a debate about this. Some studies say there's no significant psychological impact, while others might report some negative emotions. But is it frequent? I'm not certain.

Option C: Women who have abortions are more likely to have difficulty conceiving in the future. I don't recall any strong evidence linking abortion to future fertility issues. In fact, I think medical abortions are safe and don't typically cause such problems unless there's a complication, which is rare.

Option D: The experience often leads to long-term physical health issues. Again, I don't think this is correct. Abortions, especially when done legally and safely, are generally not associated with long-term physical health problems. 

Option E: The psychological consequences are no worse than for women who continue their pregnancies and give birth. This rings a bell. I think some studies have shown that the mental health outcomes for women who have abortions are comparable to those who carry the pregnancy to term. It's not necessarily worse, and context plays a big role.

Option F: Most women think no more about the event than having a wisdom tooth removed. That seems a bit dismissive. While some women might not dwell on it, others might have more complex emotions. I don't think it's the majority feeling this way.

Option G: Subsequent problems in sexual adjustment and relationships with men are common. I haven't heard that as a common outcome. It might happen for some, but I don't think it's a frequent result for most women.

Option H: Women who have abortions are less likely to want children in the future. I don't think that's true. Many women who have abortions do go on to have children later when their circumstances are better.

Option I: The majority experience severe post-traumatic stress disorder. That sounds extreme. I don't think PTSD is a common outcome for most women after an abortion.

Option J: Most suffer from severe depression and anxiety for years afterward. Again, this seems too extreme. Most women don't experience long-term severe mental health issues.

So, considering all this, the correct answer is probably E. Research suggests that the psychological effects are not worse than those experienced by women who give birth. I remember reading that the American Psychological Association has found that having an abortion doesn't lead to long-term mental health issues for most women, and that the emotional responses vary widely but aren't typically more severe than other life events.

The correct answer is E. Research indicates that the psychological consequences of abortion are no worse than those experienced by women who continue their pregnancies and give birth.
