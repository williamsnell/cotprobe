Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about the prevailing notion before Lyell and Darwin. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my history of science, but let's try to think this through.

First, I remember that Lyell and Darwin were key figures in the development of geological and biological thought, respectively. Lyell was a geologist, and Darwin is famous for evolution. So the question is about what people believed before their time.

The options are about the age of the Earth and whether populations change. So I need to recall the historical context.

I think before Lyell and Darwin, the majority view was influenced by religious beliefs, particularly the biblical account. So the Earth was considered young, right? Like, a few thousand years old. Because according to the Bible, the Earth wasn't that old, and Ussher's calculation put it around 4004 BC or something.

As for populations, I remember that before Darwin, the idea of species changing over time wasn't widely accepted. People believed in the fixity of species, meaning species were unchanging and created as they are. This was part of a static view of nature.

So putting it together: Earth was thought to be a few thousand years old, and populations (or species) were seen as unchanging.

Looking at the options, option D says Earth is a few thousand years old and populations are unchanging. Option H says a few thousand years old and populations gradually change. No, because before Darwin, gradual change wasn't the idea. They thought species were fixed.

Option C says populations rapidly change, which sounds more like something after Darwin, or maybe like punctuated equilibrium, but that's more modern. Option D seems right.

Wait, what about Lyell's contribution? Lyell was a proponent of uniformitarianism, which suggests the Earth is much older and changes occur gradually. But the question is before Lyell and Darwin. So before Lyell, the prevailing view was a young Earth with catastrophism, like in Cuvier's theories. So yes, Earth was young, a few thousand years, and species unchanging.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D.

The prevailing notion prior to the time of Lyell and Darwin was that the Earth was relatively young, typically believed to be a few thousand years old based on biblical interpretations. Additionally, the idea of species or populations changing over time was not widely accepted; instead, the dominant view was the fixity of species, meaning they were unchanging and as they were created. This aligns with option D: Earth is a few thousand years old, and populations are unchanging.

Answer: D
