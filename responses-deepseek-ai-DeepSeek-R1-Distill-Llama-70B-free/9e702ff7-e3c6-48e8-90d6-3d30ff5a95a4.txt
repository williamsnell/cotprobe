Okay, so I've got this series to sum: the double sum from m=1 to infinity and n=1 to infinity of (m²n)/(3^m (n3^m + m3^n)). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. I remember that double sums can sometimes be tricky, but maybe there's a way to simplify this.

First, let me write out the general term to see if I can spot any patterns or symmetries. The term is (m² n)/(3^m (n3^m + m3^n)). Let me try to break that down. The denominator is 3^m times (n3^m + m3^n), which can be written as 3^m * n3^m + 3^m * m3^n. Wait, that would be n 3^(2m) + m 3^(m + n). Hmm, not sure if that helps immediately.

Wait a minute, maybe I can factor something out or find a substitution. Let me consider swapping m and n. If I swap m and n in the term, what happens? Let's see: the original term is (m² n)/(3^m (n3^m + m3^n)). If I swap m and n, it becomes (n² m)/(3^n (m3^n + n3^m)). Simplify that: (n² m)/(3^n (m3^n + n3^m)) = (n m²)/(3^n (m3^n + n3^m)). Compare this to the original term: (m² n)/(3^m (n3^m + m3^n)). So the swapped term is (n m²)/(3^n (m3^n + n3^m)) = (m² n 3^m)/(3^{m+n} (m3^n + n3^m)) ). Wait, maybe that's getting me somewhere.

Wait, if I add the original term and the swapped term, maybe something cancels out. Let me denote the term as T(m,n) and T(n,m) as the swapped version.

So T(m,n) + T(n,m) = [m² n/(3^m (n3^m + m3^n))] + [n² m/(3^n (m3^n + n3^m))].

Wait, but the denominators are the same because addition is commutative: n3^m + m3^n is the same as m3^n + n3^m. So the denominators are the same, which is 3^m (n3^m + m3^n) for T(m,n) and 3^n (m3^n + n3^m) for T(n,m). Hmm.

Wait, let's consider the sum over m and n. Let's say I sum T(m,n) over all m and n, then also sum T(n,m) over all m and n. But since m and n are just dummy variables, the sum of T(n,m) is the same as the sum of T(m,n). So the total sum S would be equal to sum_{m,n} T(m,n) = sum_{m,n} T(n,m). But if I add S and S, I get sum_{m,n} [T(m,n)+T(n,m)].

So 2S = sum_{m,n} [T(m,n) + T(n,m)]. Let's compute T(m,n) + T(n,m):

[m² n/(3^m D)] + [n² m/(3^n D)], where D = (n3^m + m3^n).

Factor out mn/D from both terms:

mn/(D) [m/(3^m) + n/(3^n)].

Hmm, that gives mn/(D) * (m/3^m + n/3^n). But D is n3^m + m3^n. So D = n 3^m + m 3^n.

So the numerator becomes mn (m 3^{-m} + n 3^{-n}) and denominator is D = n3^m + m3^n.

Wait, let's write this out:

[m² n/(3^m D)] + [n² m/(3^n D)] = [m n (m 3^{-m} + n 3^{-n}) ] / D.

But D = n3^m + m3^n. Let me factor 3^m 3^n in D, but perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, let me write D as n 3^m + m 3^n = 3^m n + 3^n m.

Wait, let's compute the numerator:

m n (m 3^{-m} + n 3^{-n}) = m² n 3^{-m} + m n² 3^{-n}.

The denominator is D = n 3^m + m 3^n.

So the entire expression is [m² n 3^{-m} + m n² 3^{-n}]/(n3^m + m3^n).

Let me split this into two terms:

Term 1: m² n 3^{-m}/(n3^m + m3^n) = m² n 3^{-m}/(n3^m + m3^n).

Term 2: m n² 3^{-n}/(n3^m + m3^n) = m n² 3^{-n}/(n3^m + m3^n).

Hmm, perhaps I can factor 3^{-m} 3^{-n} in the denominator. Wait, denominator is n 3^m + m 3^n = 3^m n + 3^n m.

Wait, let me factor 3^m 3^n from the denominator? Wait, no, that's not possible because it's a sum. Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as 3^m n (1 + (m/ n) 3^{n - m} ) but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps a substitution would help. Let me consider m and n and see if I can find a substitution that makes this expression symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator and denominator in terms of exponents. Let's think about the first term:

Term 1: m² n 3^{-m}/(n3^m + m3^n) = m² n 3^{-m}/(n3^m + m3^n).

Factor 3^{-m} in the denominator: 3^{-m} (n 3^{2m} + m 3^{n}) ).

Wait, that would make the denominator 3^{-m} (n3^{2m} + m3^n ). So the term becomes m² n / [3^m (n3^{2m} + m3^n) ) ].

Hmm, not sure that helps. Maybe I should think differently.

Wait, let's think about each term when m = n. Because when m = n, the denominator becomes n3^m + m3^n = m 3^m + m 3^m = 2 m 3^m. The numerator for T(m,m) would be m^2 m/(3^m (2 m 3^m )) ) = m^3/(3^m * 2 m 3^m) ) = m^3/(2 m 3^{2m}) ) = m²/(2 * 3^{2m} ).

But that's just for the diagonal terms where m = n. But the whole sum includes all m and n, so that might not directly help, but perhaps it's a clue.

Wait, going back to the expression I had earlier: 2S is the sum over all m,n of [mn/(D)] (m 3^{-m} + n 3^{-n} ), where D = n3^m + m3^n.

Wait, let me factor D. Let's see: D = n3^m + m3^n. Let me factor 3^m 3^n out, but that's not directly possible because D is a sum. Alternatively, maybe write D as 3^m (n + m 3^{n - m} ), but that depends on whether n>m or not. Hmm, maybe not the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the expression such that the numerator and denominator can be written in terms of a product, allowing for telescoping or simplification.

Wait, let me try to write the numerator as mn(m 3^{-m} + n 3^{-n}) and the denominator as n 3^m + m 3^n.

So the entire fraction becomes [mn(m 3^{-m} + n 3^{-n}) ] / (n 3^m + m 3^n).

Let me factor 3^{-m} from the first term in the numerator and 3^{-n} from the second term:

mn [ m 3^{-m} + n 3^{-n} ] = mn [ m 3^{-m} + n 3^{-n} ].

So the fraction is [ mn (m 3^{-m} + n 3^{-n}) ] / (n 3^m + m 3^n ).

Let me split this into two parts:

= [ m^2 n 3^{-m} + m n^2 3^{-n} ] / (n 3^m + m 3^n )

= [ m^2 n / 3^m + m n^2 / 3^n ] / (n 3^m + m 3^n )

Hmm, maybe I can write each term separately.

Term A: m^2 n/(3^m (n3^m + m3^n)).

Term B: m n^2/(3^n (n3^m + m3^n)).

Wait, but these are exactly the terms T(m,n) and T(n,m). So when I add T(m,n) and T(n,m), I get [Term A + Term B], which I've already considered.

Wait, but I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should consider that 2S is the sum over all m and n of [Term A + Term B], which equals the sum of 2T(m,n) because T(m,n) and T(n,m) are symmetric in the sum. Wait, no, that's not correct because for each (m,n), you have a corresponding (n,m), except when m=n.

Wait, but when you sum over all m and n, each pair (m,n) and (n,m) for m≠n contributes twice, once as (m,n) and once as (n,m). The diagonal terms (m,m) contribute once each.

So 2S = sum_{m≠n} [T(m,n) + T(n,m)] + sum_{m} T(m,m).

But perhaps that's complicating things. Maybe there's a better approach.

Wait, perhaps I can interchange the order of summation. Let me try to write the sum as sum_{m=1}^∞ sum_{n=1}^∞ [m² n]/(3^m (n3^m + m3^n)).

Alternatively, maybe I can split the fraction into two parts using partial fractions. Let me consider the denominator: n3^m + m3^n.

Hmm, perhaps I can write 1/(n3^m + m3^n) as [A/(n3^m)] + [B/(m3^n)], but I'm not sure. Let me try:

1/(n3^m + m3^n) = A/(n3^m) + B/(m3^n).

Multiply both sides by (n3^m + m3^n):

1 = A (m3^n) + B (n3^m).

Hmm, let's solve for A and B. For this to hold for all m and n, perhaps A and B are functions of m and n? Not sure, maybe this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the denominator as 3^m (n + m 3^{n - m} ), assuming m ≤ n or something. But that might complicate things.

Wait, let me try to change variables. Let me set k = m and l = n, but that's just renaming. Alternatively, maybe set m = n + p or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: Let me consider summing over m first and then over n, or vice versa. Maybe the sum can be separated.

Let me try to write the term as (m² n) / [3^m (n3^m + m3^n)] = (m² n) / [n 3^{2m} + m 3^{m + n} }.

Hmm, perhaps this can be split into two terms:

= [m² n]/(n 3^{2m}) ) * [1 / (1 + (m 3^{m + n})/(n 3^{2m})) ) ]

= [m² n]/(n 3^{2m}) ) * [1 / (1 + (m/n) 3^{n - m}) ) ]

Hmm, but that might not help because it introduces a series within a series, which could get complicated.

Wait, perhaps there's a symmetry or a way to write this as a telescoping series. Let me think about that.

Another approach: Maybe consider swapping m and n and adding the two expressions, then see if that simplifies.

Wait, earlier I thought about adding T(m,n) and T(n,m), and that led to an expression involving [mn (m/3^m + n/3^n)] / [n3^m + m3^n].

Wait, perhaps I can factor something out here. Let me write the denominator as n3^m + m3^n = 3^m n + 3^n m.

Let me factor 3^m 3^n out, which gives 3^m 3^n (n 3^{-n} + m 3^{-m}) ) = 3^{m + n} (n/3^n + m/3^m).

So the denominator D = 3^{m + n} (n/3^n + m/3^m).

Now, the numerator in the added term is mn (m/3^m + n/3^n).

So the fraction becomes [mn (m/3^m + n/3^n)] / [3^{m + n} (n/3^n + m/3^m)) ].

Notice that (m/3^m + n/3^n) is the same as (n/3^n + m/3^m), so it cancels out. So the fraction simplifies to mn / 3^{m + n}.

So 2S = sum_{m=1}^∞ sum_{n=1}^∞ [mn / 3^{m + n} }.

Wait, that's a much simpler expression! So 2S is the double sum of mn / 3^{m + n}.

I can compute this double sum. Let's compute sum_{m=1}^∞ sum_{n=1}^∞ (m n) / 3^{m + n}.

This can be written as (sum_{m=1}^∞ m / 3^m) ) * (sum_{n=1}^∞ n / 3^n) ), because the sums are independent.

I remember that sum_{k=1}^∞ k x^k = x/(1 - x)^2, for |x| < 1. So in this case, x = 1/3.

So sum_{m=1}^∞ m / 3^m = (1/3) / (1 - 1/3)^2 = (1/3) / (4/9) ) = (1/3) * (9/4) ) = 3/4.

Similarly, sum_{n=1}^∞ n / 3^n = 3/4 as well.

So the product is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

Thus, 2S = 9/16, so S = 9/32.

Wait, but wait—does that make sense? Let me confirm the steps again.

I had 2S = sum_{m,n} mn / 3^{m+n}.

Which is equal to (sum m/3^m)^2 = (3/4)^2 = 9/16. So yes, 2S = 9/16 → S = 9/32.

Wait, but 9/32 is 0.28125. Let me check the options. Option D is 0.28125, so that's probably the answer.

But wait a second, earlier I thought that 2S equals 9/16, which gives S as 9/32, which is 0.28125. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but I should double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So 2S = sum_{m,n} [T(m,n) + T(n,m)] = sum_{m,n} mn / 3^{m + n}.

Which is indeed (sum m/3^m)^2 = (3/4)^2 = 9/16.

So S = 9/32 = 0.28125, which is option D.

The given series is:

\[
\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n3^m + m3^n)}.
\]

To simplify, we consider the symmetry of the terms by swapping \(m\) and \(n\). The term \(T(m,n)\) becomes \(T(n,m)\) when \(m\) and \(n\) are swapped, and the denominator remains unchanged due to the commutative property of addition. Adding \(T(m,n)\) and \(T(n,m)\), we get:

\[
T(m,n) + T(n,m) = \frac{m^2 n}{3^m (n3^m + m3^n)} + \frac{n^2 m}{3^n (m3^n + n3^m)}.
\]

Factoring out common terms and simplifying, the numerator becomes:

\[
\frac{mn}{n3^m + m3^n} \left(\frac{m}{3^m} + \frac{n}{3^n}\right),
\]

and the denominator is:

\[
n3^m + m3^n.
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
\frac{mn}{3^{m+n}}.
\]

Thus, the double sum of \(T(m,n) + T(n,m)\) over all \(m\) and \(n\) becomes:

\[
\sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{mn}{3^{m+n}}.
\]

This can be factored into two independent sums:
