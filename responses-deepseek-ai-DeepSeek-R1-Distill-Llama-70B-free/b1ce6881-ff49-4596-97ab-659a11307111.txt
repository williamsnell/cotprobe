Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of Gibbs energy and stuff. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question is about calculating the standard Gibbs energy of formation of phenol at 298 K. The data given includes the standard enthalpy of combustion of solid phenol, which is -3054 kJ/mol, and its standard molar entropy, which is 144.0 J/K·mol. Hmm, wait, also, the problem mentions that all gases are perfect and data is at 298.15 K unless stated otherwise.

I remember that the standard Gibbs energy of formation (ΔGf°) is calculated using the formula ΔGf° = ΔHf° - TΔSf°. But wait, no, wait. Oh right, the Gibbs energy of formation is for the compound from its elements in their standard states. So I need to find ΔHf° and ΔSf° for phenol.

Wait, but wait. I think another approach is needed here. Because the given value is the enthalpy of combustion, not the enthalpy of formation. So maybe I should start there.

The standard enthalpy of combustion is the enthalpy change when one mole of a substance is burned completely in oxygen. For phenol, the combustion reaction would be:

C6H5OH(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(l)

Wait, but I need to balance this equation. Let me write it out properly. Phenol is C6H5OH, which has 6 carbons, 6 hydrogens (since it's C6H5-OH, so total of 6 H in the ring and one in the OH, making 6 + 1 = 7 H? Wait no, wait. Phenol structure: C6H5-OH. So the formula is C6H5OH. Wait, that would mean it's C6H5(OH), so molecular formula is C6H5OH → that is C6H6O, right? Because C6H5 is C6H5, and then OH is O and H, so total H is 6 (from C6H5) plus 1 (from OH) gives 7 H? Wait no, wait, wait. Wait, C6H5 is a phenyl group, which is C6H5. So C6H5OH would be C6H5-OH, which is C6H6O. Wait no, that's not right. Wait, phenol is C6H5OH, which is C6H5(OH), so the formula would be C6H5OH → that's C6H6O. Wait, but let me count: C6H5 is 5 carbons and 5 hydrogens? No, wait, wait. Benzene is C6H6. Phenol is C6H5OH, which is C6H5-OH. So the molecular formula is C6H5(OH), which is C6H6O. Wait, no, wait: C6H5 has 5 carbons and 5 hydrogens? No, wait, no. Benzene is C6H6. When you replace a hydrogen with an OH group, you get C6H5OH. So the formula is C6H5OH, which is C6H6O. So molecular formula is C6H6O. So in the combustion reaction, each mole of phenol will produce 6 moles of CO2 and 3 moles of H2O.

Wait, let me write the balanced equation:

C6H5OH(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(l)

Let's balance it.

On the left: 6 C, 6 H (from the C6H5OH?), plus O from OH and O2. Wait, the molecular formula of phenol: C6H5OH is C6H5(OH) → C6H6O. So each molecule has 6 C, 6 H, and 1 O.

So the combustion reaction would produce CO2 and H2O.

So:

C6H5OH(s) + O2 → CO2 + H2O

Let me count the atoms on both sides.

Left side:
C: 6
H: 6 (from C6H5OH)
O: 1 (from phenol) + 2*(O2) → but O2 is O in gaseous form.

Right side:
CO2: each has 1 C and 2 O.
H2O: each has 2 H and 1 O.

So let's balance C first. There are 6 C in phenol, so we need 6 CO2 on the right.

So 6 CO2.

Now for H: phenol has 6 H, which will end up as H2O. Each H2O has 2 H, so 6 H would require 3 H2O (since 3 * 2 H =6 H).

So now, the right side is 6 CO2 + 3 H2O.

Now, let's count O on the right:

CO2: 6 * 2 =12 O
H2O: 3 *1 =3 O
Total O: 15 O.

On the left, O comes from phenol (1 O) and O2. So total O on the left is (1) + 2*(moles of O2).

So: 1 + 2*(moles O2) =15 → 2 moles O2 =14 → moles O2=7.

So the balanced equation is:

C6H5OH(s) + 7 O2(g) → 6 CO2(g) + 3 H2O(l)

Now, the standard enthalpy of combustion (ΔcH°) is given as -3054 kJ/mol. That's the enthalpy change when one mole of phenol combusts completely.

Now, the enthalpy of combustion is related to the enthalpies of formation of the products and reactants. The formula is:

ΔcH° = Σ ΔfH°(products) - Σ ΔfH°(reactants)

In this case, the reactants are phenol (C6H5OH) and O2. The products are CO2 and H2O.

But wait, O2 is in its standard state, so its ΔfH° is zero. So the equation becomes:

ΔcH° = [6 * ΔfH°(CO2) + 3 * ΔfH°(H2O)] - [ΔfH°(C6H5OH) + 7 * ΔfH°(O2)]

But since O2 is zero, this simplifies to:

ΔcH° = 6 ΔfH°(CO2) + 3 ΔfH°(H2O) - ΔfH°(C6H5OH)

We can rearrange this to solve for ΔfH°(C6H5OH):

ΔfH°(C6H5OH) = 6 ΔfH°(CO2) + 3 ΔfH°(H2O) - ΔcH°

Wait, but wait. Wait, ΔcH° is negative because it's exothermic. So in the equation, when the phenol combusts, it releases heat, so the enthalpy change is negative.

Wait, let me make sure I'm getting the signs right. The standard enthalpy of combustion is the enthalpy change when a substance burns. So the combustion of phenol releases heat, making ΔcH° negative. So in the equation above, the right side is:

products' ΔfH° minus reactants' ΔfH° equals ΔcH°, which is negative.

So, moving on. I need the standard enthalpies of formation for CO2 and H2O.

I recall (or can look up) the standard enthalpies of formation:

ΔfH°(CO2) is -393.5 kJ/mol (I think that's the value)
ΔfH°(H2O, l) is -285.8 kJ/mol

Wait, but I should double-check these values. Let me think. Yeah, CO2 is about -393.5 kJ/mol, and H2O(l) is around -285.8 or something close.

So let's plug in these numbers.

So:

ΔfH°(C6H5OH) = 6*(-393.5) + 3*(-285.8) - (-3054)

Wait, because ΔcH° is -3054, so when we subtract it, it becomes +3054.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute 6*(-393.5) = 6 * (-393.5) = let's calculate:

393.5 * 6: 393.5 * 5 is 1967.5, plus 393.5 is 2361. So 6*(-393.5) = -2361 kJ.

Then 3*(-285.8) = 3*(-285.8) = let's see: 285.8 *3. 285 *3 is 855, 0.8*3=2.4 → 857.4. So 3*(-285.8) = -857.4 kJ.

So the sum of these two is -2361 + (-857.4) = -2361 -857.4 = -3218.4 kJ.

Now, subtracting ΔcH°, which is -3054, so:

ΔfH°(C6H5OH) = (-3218.4) - (-3054) → -3218.4 +3054 = -164.4 kJ/mol.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, wait: the formula was ΔfH°(phenol) = 6*ΔfH°(CO2) +3*ΔfH°(H2O) - ΔcH°.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the formula.

The correct formula is:

ΔcH° = [sum ΔfH°(products)] - [sum ΔfH°(reactants)]

So, rearranged:

sum ΔfH°(reactants) = sum ΔfH°(products) - ΔcH°

But wait, the reactants are phenol and O2. O2's ΔfH° is zero. So:

ΔfH°(phenol) + 7*(0) = 6*ΔfH°(CO2) +3*ΔfH°(H2O) - ΔcH°

So,

ΔfH°(phenol) = 6*ΔfH°(CO2) +3*ΔfH°(H2O) - ΔcH°

Wait, no. Because the standard enthalpy of combustion is defined as the enthalpy change when 1 mole combusts, so the equation is:

ΔcH° = [6*ΔfH°(CO2) +3*ΔfH°(H2O)] - [ΔfH°(C6H5OH) + 7*0]

So,

ΔcH° = 6*ΔfH°(CO2) +3*ΔfH°(H2O) - ΔfH°(C6H5OH)

Which rearranges to:

ΔfH°(C6H5OH) = 6*ΔfH°(CO2) +3*ΔfH°(H2O) - ΔcH°

So, plugging in the numbers.

6*(-393.5) = -2361

3*(-285.8)= -857.4

Sum: -2361 -857.4 = -3218.4

Now, subtract ΔcH°, which is -3054. So:

-3218.4 - (-3054) = -3218.4 +3054 = -164.4 kJ/mol.

Hmm, that gives the standard enthalpy of formation of phenol as -164.4 kJ/mol. But wait, I thought phenol's ΔfH° was around -50 kJ/mol. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong sign for ΔcH°. Let me think again. ΔcH° is the enthalpy change of the combustion reaction. So when phenol combusts, it releases heat, so the reaction is exothermic. That makes ΔcH° negative. So in the equation, when we have:

ΔcH° = [products] - [reactants] → negative value.

So if I'm solving for ΔfH°(phenol), the equation is:

ΔfH°(phenol) = 6*(CO2) +3*(H2O) - ΔcH°

Wait, but wait, no: the equation is ΔcH° = sum(products) - sum(reactants). So sum(reactants) is phenol (ΔfH°) + O2 (0). So:

ΔcH° = [6*CO2 +3*H2O] - [phenol + 7*O2]

Which is:

ΔcH° = 6*CO2 +3*H2O - phenol

So,

phenol =6*CO2 +3*H2O - ΔcH°

Wait, no, wait. Let me make it clearer. Let me write the equation:

ΔcH° = [6*(ΔfH° CO2) + 3*(ΔfH° H2O)] - [1*(ΔfH° phenol) +7*(ΔfH° O2)]

ΔfH° O2 is zero, so:

ΔcH° = 6*(ΔfH° CO2) +3*(ΔfH° H2O) - (ΔfH° phenol)

Rearranged:

ΔfH° phenol =6*(ΔfH° CO2) +3*(ΔfH° H2O) - ΔcH°

So, plugging in the numbers:

6*(-393.5) = -2361

3*(-285.8) = -857.4

Sum: -2361 + (-857.4) = -3218.4

Now, subtract ΔcH° which is -3054.

So,

ΔfH° phenol = (-3218.4) - (-3054) = (-3218.4) +3054 = -164.4 kJ/mol.

Hmm, but I was under the impression that phenol has a positive ΔfH°. Maybe I'm mixing something up. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that phenol is a stable compound, so its ΔfH° is negative. But let me proceed.

So now I have ΔfH° of phenol as -164.4 kJ/mol.

Next, the question is about the standard Gibbs energy of formation, ΔGf°. The formula is:

ΔGf° = ΔHf° - TΔSf°

Wait, but wait. ΔGf° is the Gibbs energy change when the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So I think that formula applies here.

But wait, I don't have the entropy change of formation, ΔSf°. So I need to calculate that.

The entropy change of formation is calculated as:

ΔSf° = S°(products) - S°(reactants)

But wait, for the formation reaction of phenol. The standard formation reaction is:

6 C(graphite) + 3 H2(g) + ½ O2(g) → C6H5OH(s)

So, the ΔSf° would be:

S°(C6H5OH) - [6 S°(C) + 3 S°(H2) + ½ S°(O2)]

I have the S° of phenol as 144.0 J/K·mol. I need to find the S° of the elements in their standard states.

Standard molar entropies:

C (graphite): 5.74 J/K·mol
H2(g): 130.68 J/K·mol
O2(g): 205.14 J/K·mol

So,

ΔSf° = 144.0 - [6*(5.74) + 3*(130.68) + ½*(205.14)]

Let me compute each term.

6*5.74 = 34.44

3*130.68 = 392.04

½ *205.14 = 102.57

Sum of reactants' S°: 34.44 + 392.04 +102.57 = let's add 34.44 + 392.04 = 426.48, plus 102.57 gives 529.05 J/K·mol.

So,

ΔSf° = 144.0 - 529.05 = -385.05 J/K·mol.

Convert that to kJ: -385.05 J/K·mol = -0.38505 kJ/(K·mol)

Now, calculate TΔSf°. T is 298 K.

TΔSf° = 298 * (-0.38505) ≈ let's compute this:

298 * 0.38505 ≈ let's see.

0.385 * 300 = 115.5, but since it's 298, which is 2 less than 300.

0.38505 *298 = ?

Compute 0.38505 * 300 = 115.515

Subtract 0.38505 *2 = 0.7701 → 115.515 -0.7701 = 114.7449 kJ/mol.

But since ΔSf° is negative, TΔSf° is -114.7449 kJ/mol.

Now, ΔGf° = ΔHf° - TΔSf°

Wait no, wait the formula is ΔGf° = ΔHf° - TΔSf°

Wait, but wait, I think I got that wrong. Actually, the correct formula is:

ΔGf° = ΔHf° - TΔSf°

Wait, but wait, let's make sure.

The Gibbs free energy of formation is calculated as:

ΔGf° = ΔHf° - TΔSf°

Yes, that's correct.

So plugging in the numbers:

ΔHf° is -164.4 kJ/mol (from earlier calculation)

TΔSf° is 298 * (-385.05 J/mol·K) → which is -114,744.9 J/mol → which is -114.7449 kJ/mol.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I calculated ΔSf° as -385.05 J/(mol·K), which is -0.38505 kJ/(
