Question:

In 1981, a devoted conservationist, was the owner of a 100-acre tract of undeveloped land. In that year, the conservationist conveyed the tract "to my nephew in fee simple, provided, however, that the grantee agrees that neither he nor his heirs or assigns shall ever use the property for any commercial purpose. If any portion of said tract is used for other than residential purposes, then the grantor or his successors in interest may re-enter as of the grantor's former estate. " This deed was properly recorded. The nephew died intestate in 1999, survived by his wife. The conservationist died in 2002, survived by his two daughters, his only heirs. During the period between 1981 and 2007, the spreading development from a nearby city began to engulf the tract. Though still undeveloped, the tract became surrounded by office buildings, shopping malls, and other commercial edifices. In 2009, the wife executed and delivered to a developer a fee simple conveyance of the tract, which the developer immediately recorded. The deed did not contain any reference to the restriction noted above. After the developer acquired title to the tract, he commenced construction of a hotel complex on a portion of the tract that bordered an apartment building. The applicable recording statute in effect in this jurisdiction provides, in part, "No deed or other instrument in writing, not recorded in accordance with this statute, shall affect the title or rights to, in any real estate, or any devisee or purchaser in good faith, without knowledge of the existence of such unrecorded instruments. "If one of the daughters brings suit to enjoin the developer from constructing the hotel, the plaintiff will most likely

Options:

A: lose, because the developer was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the restriction.
B: win, because either daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken.
C: win, because the restriction on commercial use was recorded and thus the developer should have been aware of it.
D: lose, because a common development scheme had been established for the entire tract.
E: win, because either daughter's right to the tract vested immediately upon the developer's construction of the hotel complex.
F: lose, because the restriction was not included in the deed from the wife to the developer.
G: lose, because the wife had the right to sell the property without any restrictions.
H: win, because the developer violated the deed's prohibition against commercial use.
I: win, because the daughters, as the conservationist's only heirs, received a valid possibility of reverter from their father.
J: lose, because the restriction on the use of the property is unenforceable.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.

So, the setup is about a conservationist who owned 100 acres of undeveloped land. In 1981, he conveys the tract to his nephew in fee simple. But there's a condition: the grantee (nephew) agrees that neither he nor his heirs or assigns will ever use the property for any commercial purpose. If they do, the grantor (conservationist) or his successors can re-enter and take back the estate.

This deed was properly recorded. Then, the nephew died intestate in 1999, survived by his wife. The conservationist died in 2002, leaving two daughters as his only heirs.

Between 1981 and 2007, the area around the tract developed a lotâ€”office buildings, shopping malls, etc. But the tract itself remained undeveloped. In 2009, the wife sells the tract to a developer via a fee simple conveyance. The deed from the wife didn't mention the restriction. The developer recorded it and started building a hotel, which is a commercial use.

Now, one of the daughters is suing to stop the developer. The question is about whether she'll win or lose, and why.

The applicable recording statute says that unrecorded deeds don't affect the rights of a bona fide purchaser (BFP) for value without knowledge of the unrecorded instrument.

Hmm. So, first, I need to determine if the restriction is enforceable against the developer. The key issues here are: what kind of interest did the conservationist create when he conveyed the property with that condition, and is the developer bound by it?

When the conservationist conveyed the property with a condition, it's likely a fee simple determinable with a right of re-entry. The language "provided, however, that..." and "if any portion... may re-enter" sounds like a condition subsequent. So, the grantor has a right of re-entry, which is a type of future interest called a possibility of reverter.

But wait, the nephew got a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. So when the condition is breached (using the land commercially), the grantor (or his successors) can exercise the right of re-entry and take back the property.

Now, the nephew died intestate, so his wife would inherit his interest. But when the wife sold the property, did she have the right to do so without the restriction? Or does the restriction bind subsequent purchasers?

The issue is whether the restriction was properly recorded and whether the developer had notice. The original deed was recorded in 1981, so any subsequent purchaser should have been on notice if they did a proper title search.

The recording statute here is a notice statute. So, a BFP who takes without notice of prior unrecorded interests would prevail. But in this case, the restriction was recorded. So the developer, when purchasing, should have known about it if they did due diligence.

Wait, but the wife's deed to the developer didn't mention the restriction. Does that matter? No, because the restriction is part of the original deed, and if it's properly recorded, the developer should have found it when checking the chain of title.

So, the developer, as a purchaser, would have been on notice of the restriction because it's recorded. Therefore, they can't claim bona fide purchaser status without notice. So, the developer would be bound by the restriction.

But wait, another angle: the restriction was in the original deed from the conservationist to the nephew. When the nephew died, his wife inherited his interest. But when she sold to the developer, she conveyed whatever interest she had. But if the original deed had a condition subsequent, then the only way the property can revert is if the condition is broken and someone exercises the right of re-entry.

Alternatively, the restriction could be considered a covenant. But the original deed's condition creates a servitude, perhaps an equitable servitude. Equitable servitudes are enforceable against subsequent purchasers if the original restriction was properly recorded and there's notice.

But wait, in real covenants, the requirements are horizontal privity, vertical privity, and touch and concern. Equitable servitudes don't require privity but do require notice.

So, if the restriction was properly recorded, the developer had constructive notice. So, the servitude would bind the developer.

But then, what about the possibility that the wife's conveyance somehow extinguished the restriction? No, because the restriction is a burden on the land that runs with it, regardless of who owns it, provided it's properly recorded.

Wait, but the problem says that the developer's deed didn't mention the restriction. But that doesn't matter because the original deed was recorded. So, when the developer took the deed from the wife, the title search should have revealed the prior restriction.

So, the developer can't claim to be a BFP without notice because the restriction was recorded. Therefore, the developer is bound by it.

So, when the developer starts using it commercially, the condition is breached. The right of re-entry is held by the grantor or his successors. The grantor (conservationist) died, so his successors are his two daughters. They have the right to enforce the condition.

So, when the developer starts building the hotel, the daughters can exercise the right of re-entry. They can sue to enjoin the construction because the condition has been breached.

Looking at the options:

Option B says they'll win because either daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken. Option C says they'll win because the restriction was recorded, so the developer should have known. Option E says they win because their right vested when the developer built. Option I says they have a possibility of reverter.

Wait, the original conveyance was a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. The future interest retained by the grantor is a right of re-entry, not a possibility of reverter. A possibility of reverter arises in a fee simple determinable, where the grant is "so long as..." or "until...". Here, the language is "on condition that... if...", which is a condition subsequent, so the future interest is a right of entry, not a possibility of reverter.

So, I think option B is about the right of re-entry, which would be correct. Option I is about possibility of reverter, which isn't the case here.

Option C is also a possible answer because the restriction was recorded, so the developer should have known. But the real issue is whether the developer is bound by the condition, regardless of whether the deed from the wife mentioned it.

So, the key point is that the restriction was properly recorded, so the developer is bound. Therefore, the daughters can enforce the condition.

Looking at the options, let's see:

A: lose because developer is BFP without notice. Unlikely, because the restriction was recorded, so developer had constructive notice.

B: win because right of re-entry exists. This seems correct.

C: win because restriction was recorded. Also correct reasoning. So both B and C seem possible.

Wait, but the question is about whether the developer is bound. Since the restriction was recorded, the developer can't be a BFP without notice, so the daughters can enforce the condition. So, the suit would likely win on those grounds.

So, the answer would be either B or C.

Wait, but the right of re-entry is a future interest. The condition is that if the land is used commercially, the grantor or his successors can re-enter. So, when the developer starts commercial use, the condition is breached, and the daughters have the right to enforce it.

So, the daughters can sue to enjoin the construction because the condition was breached.

So, option B says they win because of the right of re-entry. Option C says they win because the restriction was recorded, so developer should have known.

So, both B and C present valid points. But which is the better answer?

In property law, when a condition subsequent with a right of re-entry is properly recorded, subsequent purchasers are bound by it if they had notice. Here, since the original deed was recorded, the developer had constructive notice. Therefore, the daughters, as successors to the grantor, can enforce the condition.

So, the correct reasoning is that the restriction was recorded, so the developer is bound, making option C correct. But wait, the original deed was from 1981, and the developer purchased in 2009. The developer's title search should have found the original restriction. Therefore, the restriction is enforceable against the developer.

But option B is about the right of re-entry, which is the mechanism for enforcement. So, the daughters can exercise that right because the condition was broken.

Hmm. So, which option is more accurate?

The question is asking what will the plaintiff (daughter) most likely do. She brings suit to enjoin construction. The grounds would be based on the enforceability of the restriction.

So, the developer is bound by the restriction because it was recorded, so he can't claim BFP status. Therefore, the condition stands, and the daughters can enforce it.

So, the best answer would be either B or C. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: win because right of re-entry for condition broken.

Option C: win because the restriction was recorded, so developer aware.

Which is more precise? The fact that the restriction was recorded is what makes the developer bound. Without that, even if there's a right of re-entry, the developer might not be bound.

Wait, but the original deed was recorded, so the developer had constructive notice. Therefore, the restriction is enforceable against him.

So, the correct reasoning is that the developer had notice, making option C the reason for the win.

Alternatively, the right of re-entry is the cause of action, so option B would be the reason.

I think both points are correct, but the recording aspect is the key to why the developer is bound. So, without the recording, the developer might have been a BFP. But since it was recorded, he isn't, so the restriction is enforceable.

So, the answer is either B or C. Let me check the options again.

Option B: win, right of re-entry.

Option C: win, because restriction recorded.

In the exam setting, the correct answer would focus on the enforceability of the restriction against the developer, which hinges on the recording. So the reasoning in C is about the developer being on notice, making the restriction enforceable. Therefore, the answer would be C.

Wait, but the problem states that the applicable recording statute is a notice statute. So, if the developer is a BFP without notice, they take free of the prior unrecorded interest. But in this case, the restriction was recorded, so the developer can't claim lack of notice. Therefore, the developer is bound.

So, the correct reasoning is that the restriction was recorded, so the developer is bound, and the daughters can enforce the condition. So, the answer should be C.

But wait, the original restriction was in the 1981 deed. The wife's deed to the developer didn't mention it. But the developer's title search should have revealed the prior deed's restriction. So, the developer is bound because it's recorded, regardless of the subsequent deed.

So, the answer should be C: win because the restriction was recorded and thus the developer should have been aware of it.

Wait, but another thought: the wife's deed to the developer was a fee simple conveyance, but the original deed from the conservationist to the nephew was a fee simple subject to a condition. So, the wife only had the restricted fee simple, so when she conveyed, she couldn't convey more than she had. Therefore, the developer took subject to the existing restriction.

So, yes, the restriction was already on the title, and the developer is bound, so the daughters can enforce.

Therefore, the correct answer is either B or C. But I'm now a bit confused.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option B: right of re-entry for condition broken.

Option C: developer should have been aware because it was recorded.

The question is whether the developer is bound by the restriction. If the restriction was properly recorded, the developer is charged with knowledge, so they can't be a BFP without notice. Therefore, the daughters can enforce the condition.

So, the reason for the win is that the restriction was recorded, making the developer aware, so option C is correct.

But wait, some might argue that the right of re-entry is the cause of action, making B correct. However, without the recording, the right of re-entry might not be enforceable against a BFP.

So, in this case, the key fact is the recording, which makes the developer bound. Therefore, the answer is C.

But another point: when the wife sold to the developer, she conveyed whatever interest she had. Her interest was subject to the condition. So, the developer took subject to that condition because it was in the chain of title.

So, in conclusion, the answer should be C.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the developer is bound by a restriction on commercial use that was included in the original 1981 deed. The conservationist conveyed the property to his nephew in fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, which prohibited commercial use and granted the conservationist (or his successors) a right of re-entry if the condition was breached. This deed was properly recorded, and the restriction was part of the chain of title. The developer, therefore, had constructive notice of the restriction, as a proper title search would have revealed it.

The applicable recording statute is a notice statute, meaning that a bona fide purchaser (BFP) for value without notice of an unrecorded interest would take title free of that interest. However, since the restriction was recorded in 1981, the developer cannot claim BFP status without notice. The developer was bound by the restriction, regardless of whether the wife's deed to the developer mentioned it. The wife only had the restricted fee simple interest, so she could not convey more than that.

When the developer began constructing a hotel (a commercial use), the condition was breached, giving the daughters, as successors to the conservationist's right of re-entry, the ability to enforce the restriction. The key issue is that the restriction was properly recorded, making the developer aware of it, and thus enforceable against them.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The developer cannot claim BFP status because the restriction was recorded, giving constructive notice.
- **B**: Correct reasoning but incomplete. While the right of re-entry exists, the enforceability against the developer hinges on the recording of the restriction.
- **C**: Correct. The restriction was recorded, so the developer should have been aware of it, making the restriction enforceable.
- **D**: Incorrect. There is no indication of a common development scheme.
- **E**: Incorrect. The daughters' right to the tract does not vest immediately upon breach; they must exercise the right of re-entry.
- **F**: Incorrect. The omission of the restriction in the wife's deed does not matter, as the original restriction was recorded.
- **G**: Incorrect. The wife's interest was subject to the restriction, so she could not sell free of it.
- **H**: Incorrect. The developer's commercial use violated the restriction, but this option does not address the enforceability.
- **I**: Incorrect. The future interest retained by the conservationist was a right of re-entry, not a possibility of reverter.
- **J**: Incorrect. The restriction is enforceable as it was properly recorded.

The most accurate answer is **C**, as the enforceability of the restriction against the developer is based on its proper recording, which provided constructive notice to the developer.

**Answer: C**
