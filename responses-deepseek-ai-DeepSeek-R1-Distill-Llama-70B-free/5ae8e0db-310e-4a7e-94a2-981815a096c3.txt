Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see, Steve ordered plastic cases for his baseball cards. Each case has specific dimensions: length, width, and height. I need to find the volume of one case in cubic centimeters.

Hmm, I remember that the volume of a rectangular box (or case, in this scenario) is calculated by multiplying length by width by height. So the formula should be Volume = length × width × height. That makes sense because volume is the space inside the 3D object.

Let me look at the numbers again. The length is 12 centimeters, the width is 6.5 centimeters, and the height is 1.25 centimeters. So I need to multiply these three together.

Wait, let me write that down to visualize it better. So, 12 cm (length) × 6.5 cm (width) × 1.25 cm (height). Let me compute this step by step because I don't want to make a mistake.

First, I'll multiply the length and the width. 12 multiplied by 6.5. Hmm, 12 * 6 is 72, and 12 * 0.5 is 6. So 72 + 6 equals 78. So 12 × 6.5 equals 78. Okay, that's the area of the base, I think.

Now, I need to multiply that result by the height, which is 1.25 cm. So 78 × 1.25. Hmm, 1.25 is the same as 5/4, maybe that's easier. So 78 × 5/4. Let me compute 78 divided by 4 first. 4 × 19 is 76, so 78 ÷4 is 19.5. Then, 19.5 multiplied by 5. Let's see, 19 ×5 is 95, and 0.5 ×5 is 2.5. So 95 +2.5 =97.5. So the volume is 97.5 cubic centimeters.

Wait a second, let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't mess up. Alternatively, I can compute 78 ×1.25 directly. 1.25 is like adding a quarter to 1. So 78 ×1 equals 78, and 78 ×0.25 is... 78 divided by 4. 4×19=76, so 78-76=2, so 19.5. So 78 +19.5=97.5. Yep, same result.

Looking at the options provided, option F is 97.5, so that must be the correct answer. Let me just make sure none of the other options are close or if I did any step wrong. Let's see, 12×6.5: 12×6 is 72, 12×0.5 is 6, totaling 78. Then 78×1.25 is indeed 97.5. So yeah, I think F is the right choice.

To find the volume of the baseball card case, we use the formula for the volume of a rectangular box: 

\[
\text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
\]

Given the dimensions:
- Length = 12 cm
- Width = 6.5 cm
- Height = 1.25 cm

First, calculate the product of length and width:
\[
12 \times 6.5 = 78
\]

Next, multiply this result by the height:
\[
78 \times 1.25 = 97.5
\]

Thus, the volume of one baseball card case is **97.5 cubic centimeters**. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**F: 97.5**
