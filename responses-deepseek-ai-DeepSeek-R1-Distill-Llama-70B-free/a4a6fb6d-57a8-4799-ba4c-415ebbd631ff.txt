Question:

Corbet Co. purchased a copyright near the beginning of the current year from an author for $20000. The legal life of the copyright is equivalent to the life of the author plus 50 years. Corbet expects to sell the book for five years. What amount should Corbet report as amortization expense related to the copyright at the end of the current year?

Options:

A: $0
B: $2000
C: $6000
D: $7000
E: $5000
F: $500
G: $400
H: 4000
I: $8000
J: $3000

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this accounting question about amortization of a copyright. Let me read the problem again carefully.

Corbet Co. bought a copyright for $20,000 at the beginning of the current year. The legal life of the copyright is the life of the author plus 50 years. But Corbet expects to sell the book for five years. The question is asking what amount should Corbet report as amortization expense at the end of the current year.

Hmm, I remember that intangible assets, like copyrights, are amortized over their useful life. But wait, the useful life for amortization purposes is usually the shorter of the legal life or the period the company expects to use the asset. 

Wait, no, actually, I think it's the legal life because for some intangibles, the amortization period is based on their legal term. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For example, patents are amortized over their legal life, which is 20 years, regardless of their economic life. But I'm not sure about copyrights.

Wait, the problem says the legal life is the life of the author plus 50 years. So that's a long time, probably much longer than five years. But Corbet expects to sell the book for five years. So in this case, the useful life for amortization should be the shorter of the legal life or the economic life. Oh wait, but I thought for certain intangibles like copyrights and patents, you use the legal life, but maybe in this case, since the economic life is shorter, that's the period to use.

Wait, no. Let me try to recall the rules. For intangibles, if they have a definite life, you amortize them over that definite life. The legal life is the definite life here. But wait, the author's life plus 50 years is a bit indefinite because it depends on how long the author lives. But in this question, perhaps the legal life is considered definite because it's a specific term based on the author's life. So perhaps the legal life is the period to use.

But wait, the company is using the asset for only five years. So is the amortization period based on the legal life regardless of the company's usage? Or does the company's expected use take precedence?

I think in some cases, like when an asset's useful life is shorter than its legal life, the company would amortize it over the useful life. For example, if a company buys a patent that has 10 years remaining but only expects to use it for 5 years, then the amortization period would be 5 years. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about that.

Wait, the problem says the legal life is the life of the author plus 50 years. But that's a long time, likely longer than five years. So Corbet's expected use is five years. So the useful life is five years, so the amortization period should be five years.

Wait, but in some cases, like with copyrights, the legal life is fixed, and the amortization is over that period. Wait, no, perhaps the rule is that the amortization is over the shorter of the legal life or the useful economic life. So in this case, since the company is only using it for five years, the amortization period is five years.

So the cost is $20,000. If the useful life is five years, then the annual amortization would be 20,000 divided by 5, which is $4,000 per year.

Wait, but let me think again. I might be mixing up different intangible assets. Let me try to recall: For intangibles with definite lives, the amortization period is the shorter of the legal life or the economic life. Or is it the legal life unless the economic life is shorter?

Wait, no, I think for definite-lived intangibles, the amortization period is based on the asset's useful life, which can be the legal term or the economic term, whichever is shorter.

So, in this case, the legal life is the author's life plus 50 years, which is a long period, but Corbet expects to sell the book for five years. So the useful life is five years, so the amortization period is five years. Thus, the annual amortization is 20,000 /5 = 4,000.

Looking at the options, option H is 4000. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but wait another thought. Copyrights have a legal life, but if the economic life is shorter, does that affect the amortization period? I'm a bit shaky on this.

Wait, another angle: the problem says Corbet purchased the copyright, so the legal life is the author's life plus 50 years. But since Corbet is using it for five years, perhaps the amortization should be based on five years because that's the period the company expects to benefit from it.

Yes, that makes sense. So the amortization expense each year would be 20,000 divided by 5, which is 4,000.

So the correct answer is H: $4000.

Corbet Co. purchased a copyright for $20,000, and the legal life of the copyright is the life of the author plus 50 years. However, Corbet expects to sell the book for only five years. For amortization purposes, the useful life is the shorter of the legal life or the economic life. Since Corbet's expected use of the copyright is five years, the amortization period is five years. 

The annual amortization expense is calculated as:

\[
\text{Amortization Expense} = \frac{\text{Cost of Copyright}}{\text{Useful Life}} = \frac{\$20,000}{5} = \$4,000
\]

Thus, the amount Corbet should report as amortization expense at the end of the current year is **$4,000**.
