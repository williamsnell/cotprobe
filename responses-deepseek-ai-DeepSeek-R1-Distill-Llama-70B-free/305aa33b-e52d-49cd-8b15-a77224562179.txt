Okay, so I have this economics question about positive externalities and market failure. Hmm, I remember that externalities have to do with the impact of production or consumption on third parties, right? Positive externalities are when someone else benefits without paying, like when you vaccinate and it helps others too.

The question says that when there's a positive externality, it's a market failure because at the market quantity... something happens. So I need to figure out what happens at that quantity.

I think in a free market, the quantity produced is where marginal private benefit equals marginal private cost. But when there's a positive externality, the marginal social benefit (MSB) is higher than marginal private benefit (MPB) because there are extra benefits to society. So the market doesn't account for those extra benefits.

Wait, so the social benefit is more than the private benefit. So at the market quantity, which is determined by MPB=MPC (marginal private cost), the MSB is actually higher than MPC because MSB includes the extra benefits. So the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost, or wait, does it exceed MPC? Or is the issue that production is less than socially optimal.

Wait, the market outcome is where MPB = MPC, but the socially optimal point is where MSB = MSC. Since MSB > MPB, at the market quantity, the MSB is greater than the MPC (since MPC equals MPB in the market). So that would mean the marginal social benefit is greater than marginal social cost (assuming MSC is same as MPC, which I think it is unless there are production externalities).

So the market produces less than the optimal quantity because the social benefits aren't being considered. So the quantity is lower than what it should be for society's best.

Looking at the options:

Option B: the social benefits from consuming exceed the private benefits. That's true in general for positive externalities, but does it directly explain the market failure at the market quantity?

Option C: marginal social benefit exceeds marginal social cost. That's the condition for the socially optimal point, but at the market quantity, since MPB=MSC (assuming no cost externalities), and MSB > MPB, then yes, so MSB>MSC. So that would mean that at the market quantity, we're not producing enough because we haven't reached where MSB=MSC.

Wait, but the market quantity is where MPB=MSC (assuming no external costs). If MSB > MPB (because of positive externality), then at the market quantity, MSB > MSC (since MPB=MSC). So yes, C is correct.

Option D: marginal private benefit exceeds marginal social cost. No, I think it's the opposite. At market quantity, MPB=MSC (assuming no production externalities), but with positive externality, MSB>MPB. So D would say MPB is greater than MSC, which isn't the case because they're equal.

So looking back, the correct answer should be that the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost at the market quantity. Which is option C.

Wait, but another way to think is that because of the positive externality, the market produces less than the social optimum. So the quantity is too low. So which options talk about the quantity being too low?

Option A: society produces too little of the good. That's another way to put it. So if the market produces Q_market where MPB=MSC, but the social Q would be higher where MSB=MSC, so yes, Q_market is less than optimal. So society produces too little.

So the question is, the reason it's a market failure is because the market produces too little. So looking at the question, it's asking why it's a market failure because at the market quantity which of these is true.

Now I'm a bit confused. Let's go back. The question is about the consequence at the market quantity when there's a positive externality.

So in a positive externality, the market equilibrium is at a quantity where the marginal private benefit equals marginal cost, but the marginal social benefit is higher than that. So the equilibrium quantity is lower than the socially optimal quantity.

So at the market quantity, the MSB is greater than MSC (since MSB is higher than MPB which equals MSC). So option C says MSB exceeds MSC, which is true.

But option A says society produces too little. Which is also correct, but the question is about why it's a market failure because of what happens at the market quantity.

Wait, the question says, "it is deemed a market failure because at the market quantity..." So which statement explains the failure.

So, which is the correct statement. I think the correct reason is that the market doesn't produce up to where MSB=MSC; instead, it stops at MPB=MSC, leading to a lower quantity than optimal.

So option C is correct because at the market quantity, the marginal social benefit (which is higher than MPB) is greater than the marginal social cost. So society isn't producing enough because the benefits are still higher than the costs.

Alternatively, option B says the social benefits exceed the private benefits, which is true but in general. But the question is about the situation at the market quantity.

So I think the correct answer is option C.

When a positive externality exists, it leads to a market failure because the market equilibrium quantity is less than the socially optimal quantity. In a free market, the equilibrium quantity is determined where marginal private benefit (MPB) equals marginal private cost (MPC). However, with a positive externality, the marginal social benefit (MSB) exceeds the marginal private benefit (MPB) due to the additional benefits enjoyed by society. 

At the market quantity, where MPB = MPC, the MSB is greater than the MPC (since MSB > MPB). This means that the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost (MSC) at the market quantity. As a result, society produces less than the optimal quantity, as the market fails to account for the external benefits. 

Among the options provided:

- **Option A** states that society produces too little of the good, which is correct but does not directly explain the market failure at the market quantity.
- **Option C** correctly identifies that at the market quantity, the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost, which directly explains the market failure.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as it directly addresses the relationship between marginal social benefit and marginal social cost at the market quantity, which is the root of the market failure.
