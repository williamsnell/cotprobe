Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the Q-factor for an X-band EPR cavity. Hmm, I remember that Q-factor is related to the bandwidth of the resonator. Wait, what's the formula again? Oh right, I think the Q-factor is the center frequency divided by the bandwidth. Or was it the other way around? Oh wait no, the formula is Q equals the center frequency (f_center) divided by the bandwidth (delta_f). So Q = f_center / delta_f.

Wait, but wait, X-band... I should remember what the center frequency for X-band is. From what I recall, X-band is around 9.5 GHz to 10.5 GHz. Wait, but wait, more specifically, maybe 9.75 GHz? Or is it 10 GHz? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. Oh wait, I think the X-band is approximately 9.5 GHz. Let me go with that for now. So f_center is about 9.5 GHz.

Wait, but wait, the problem says it's an X-band EPR cavity. I think in EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance), the X-band typically refers to a frequency around 9.5 GHz. So that's 9.5 x 10^9 Hz.

The bandwidth given here is 1.58 MHz. Oh wait, so that's 1.58 x 10^6 Hz. So delta_f is 1.58e6 Hz.

So plugging into the formula, Q = (9.5e9 Hz) / (1.58e6 Hz). Let me compute that. 9.5e9 divided by 1.58e6. Let me do the division.

First, 9.5e9 /1.58e6 = (9.5 / 1.58) * (1e9/1e6) ) = (approx) 6.01 * 1e3. Because 9.5 divided by 1.58 is roughly 6. So 6 times 1e3 is 6000. Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

9.5 / 1.58: Let's see, 1.58 times 6 is 9.48. Oh, that's very close. So 9.5 divided by 1.58 is approximately 6. So 6 times 1e3 is 6000. So the Q-factor would be approximately 6000.

Looking at the options, I see option I is Q=6012. That's very close to my approximation of 6000. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe the exact X-band center frequency is 10 GHz? Oh, wait, no. Wait, the X-band is 8-12 GHz, I think. Oh wait, no, it's 8 to 12 GHz for microwave ovens, but EPR... Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the X-band is centered around 9.8 GHz or so.

Wait, no, more accurately, I think the X-band for EPR is around 9.5 GHz. So my initial calculation should be correct. So 9.5e9 /1.58e6 is roughly 6012, which matches option I.

To calculate the Q-factor for an X-band EPR cavity, we use the formula:

\[
Q = \frac{f_{\text{center}}}{\Delta f}
\]

Here, the center frequency \( f_{\text{center}} \) for the X-band is approximately \( 9.5 \, \text{GHz} \) (or \( 9.5 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz} \)), and the bandwidth \( \Delta f \) is given as \( 1.58 \, \text{MHz} \) (or \( 1.58 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \)).

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
Q = \frac{9.5 \times 10^9}{1.58 \times 10^6} = \frac{9.5}{1.58} \times 10^3
\]

Performing the division \( \frac{9.5}{1.58} \), we find it is approximately \( 6.01 \). Thus:

\[
Q \approx 6.01 \times 10^3 = 6012
\]

From the given options, the closest match to this calculation is:

**I: Q = 6012**

This is the correct answer.
