The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"I observe the great and wonderful mistake, both our own and our fathers, as to the civil powers of this world, acting in spiritual matters. I have read…the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground…"
Roger Williams, The Hireling Ministry None of Christ's, 1652

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the First Great Awakening and what it was a response to. Hmm, let me think. I remember from my history classes that the Great Awakenings were religious revivals in America. The First Great Awakening was in the 18th century, I think.

The question gives a quote from Roger Williams talking about the separation of civil and spiritual matters. He's against the civil government imposing religion and such things. That makes me think about the context of religious freedom and maybe a reaction against more structured or state-controlled religion.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which event or movement the First Great Awakening was a direct response to. The options are from A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Existentialism. I don't think that's right. Existentialism is more of a philosophical movement that came later, maybe 19th or 20th century. Doesn't seem related to the 1700s.

Option B: The Civil War. Wait, the American Civil War was in the 1800s, so after the First Great Awakening. So that can't be it.

Option C: The Reformation. The Reformation was in the 16th century, way before the 1700s. But the Reformation led to various Protestant denominations. Maybe the Awakening was a response to the established churches that came from the Reformation, but I'm not sure.

Option D: The Industrial Revolution. That started around the late 18th to 19th century. The First Great Awakening was earlier, so maybe not a direct response.

Option E: The Age of Exploration. That was way earlier, like 15th-17th centuries. Probably not the cause here.

Option F: Transcendentalism. That was a 19th-century movement in the US, so no.

Option G: Puritanism. Puritans were big in the 17th and early 18th centuries. The First Great Awakening was a reaction against the formalism and maybe the strictness of Puritan churches. So this could be a possible answer.

Option H: Romanticism. That was more in the late 18th to early 19th century, so probably after the Awakening.

Option I: The French Revolution. That was late 18th century, around the same time as the Awakening's later stages, but I don't think it's the cause.

Option J: The Enlightenment. The Enlightenment was in the 17th and 18th centuries, emphasizing reason and science. Maybe the Awakening was a response to the secularism or rationalism of the Enlightenment, promoting a more emotional and personal religious experience.

Wait, so the First Great Awakening was a reaction against the more formal, perhaps more enlightened or rational approach to religion. It emphasized personal conversion and emotional experiences. So maybe it was a response to the Enlightenment's influence on religion, which was becoming more about reason and less about personal spirituality.

But also, considering Roger Williams' quote, it's about the separation of church and state. The Puritans in New England had a pretty tight connection between church and state, enforcing religious practices. So the Awakening could also be a reaction against Puritanism's strict structures and the established churches.

I'm a bit torn between G and J. Let me think more. The First Great Awakening happened in the mid-1700s. The Enlightenment was happening around the same time, leading to more secular ideas. The Awakening's emphasis on revivals and personal faith could be a response to the Enlightenment's rationalism.

But another angle: the Puritan churches had become more formal, and the Awakening preachers like Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield emphasized a more personal, heartfelt religion. So it was a response to the Puritan establishment's decline in spiritual fervor.

So which is more correct? I'm trying to remember. I think the First Great Awakening was partly a reaction against the Enlightenment's rationalism and deism. People were moving away from traditional religious practices, and the Awakening brought a surge of religious enthusiasm to counter that.

Wait, but another point: the Puritans were Calvinists, and the Awakening's emphasis on personal conversion and the idea that anyone could be saved (not just the elect) was a departure from strict Puritan teachings. So maybe it was a response to Puritanism as well.

Hmm, maybe both factors are at play. But the question asks which of the options is the direct response. Looking at the options, J is the Enlightenment, and G is Puritanism.

I think the primary cause was a reaction to the Enlightenment's influence on religion, which was making some people more secular or less emotionally engaged. So the Awakening was a push back against that, emphasizing personal religious experience over rationalism.

Alternatively, it could be a reaction against the established churches, which were influenced by Puritanism. But I'm not sure which of the two is the better fit.

Wait, the question says "the First Great Awakening can be seen as a direct response to which of the following?" So the options are events or movements. The Enlightenment was a broad intellectual movement that influenced many areas, including religion. The Great Awakening was a religious movement that perhaps countered the Enlightenment's secular tendencies.

So I think the answer is J: The Enlightenment.

The First Great Awakening, which occurred in the 18th century, was a religious revival that emphasized personal conversion, emotional spirituality, and a departure from formal, institutionalized religion. To determine what it was a direct response to, we analyze the options:

- **Option A: Existentialism** and **Option F: Transcendentalism** are 19th- and 20th-century movements, making them irrelevant to the 18th-century context.  
- **Option B: The Civil War** and **Option D: The Industrial Revolution** occurred after the First Great Awakening, so they cannot be the cause.  
- **Option C: The Reformation** was in the 16th century, too early to be a direct influence.  
- **Option E: The Age of Exploration** was in the 15th-17th centuries, also too early.  
- **Option G: Puritanism** was a significant influence in the 17th and early 18th centuries. The First Great Awakening can be seen as a reaction against the strict formalism and state-church structure of Puritanism, emphasizing a more personal and emotional religious experience.  
- **Option H: Romanticism** and **Option I: The French Revolution** occurred later in the 18th century, making them less likely to be the primary cause.  
- **Option J: The Enlightenment** was a 17th- and 18th-century intellectual movement that promoted reason and secularism, which may have led to a decline in traditional religious practices. The First Great Awakening can also be viewed as a response to the Enlightenment's rationalism, emphasizing personal spirituality over secular and rational approaches.

While both Puritanism and the Enlightenment are plausible answers, the Enlightenment's influence on religion, particularly its emphasis on reason and secularism, makes it the most direct cause of the First Great Awakening as a counter-movement.
