Okay, so I have this question about GDP, and I'm a bit rusty on my economics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about calculating real GDP when given nominal GDP and the GDP deflator. 

Alright, I remember that GDP can be nominal or real. Nominal GDP is the total value of goods and services at current prices, whereas real GDP adjusts for inflation. So real GDP is kind of like the actual quantity of goods and services produced, without the distortion of price changes.

The formula I think is relevant here is the one that connects nominal GDP, real GDP, and the GDP deflator. If I recall correctly, the GDP deflator is a measure of the price level, similar to the consumer price index but specific to GDP. The formula is:

Nominal GDP = Real GDP Ã— GDP Deflator

Or, rearranged to solve for real GDP:

Real GDP = Nominal GDP / GDP Deflator

Wait, but I've heard that the GDP deflator is usually expressed as a percentage, like a number times 100. So if the deflator is 200, does that mean it's 200%, which is 2 in decimal form? Because dividing by 200 (which is 2) would make sense.

So the given numbers are nominal GDP of $6000 and a GDP deflator of 200. Plugging into the formula:

Real GDP = 6000 / 200

Let me do the math. 6000 divided by 200. Hmm, 200 times 30 is 6000, so 6000/200 is 30. Wait, but that's $30? That seems really low. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Another thought: sometimes the formula is written as:

Real GDP = Nominal GDP / (GDP Deflator / 100)

Because if the deflator is 200, it's 200 over 100 as a ratio, which is 2. So 6000 divided by 2 equals 3000. Oh, that makes more sense. So the real GDP would be $3000.

Let me make sure I'm not confusing this with the consumer price index. I think the process is similar, but the formula should be the same. So yes, if the GDP deflator is 200, that's 200/100 = 2. So dividing nominal GDP by 2 gives $3000.

Looking at the options, option J is $3,000. So the answer should be J.

Wait, let me double-check. If the deflator is 200, that's twice the base year's price level. So real GDP is nominal divided by 2, which halves it. 6000/2 is 3000. Yep, that makes sense. So J is correct.

To calculate real GDP from nominal GDP and the GDP deflator, the formula is:

\[
\text{Real GDP} = \frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{GDP Deflator}}
\]

Given that nominal GDP is $6000 and the GDP deflator is 200, we interpret the deflator as 200 in decimal form (not 200%). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Real GDP} = \frac{6000}{200} = 30
\]

However, this result seems unusually low. Recognizing that the GDP deflator is often expressed as a percentage (e.g., 200 represents 200%), the correct calculation involves dividing by 2 (since 200% = 2 in decimal form):

\[
\text{Real GDP} = \frac{6000}{2} = 3000
\]

Thus, the correct real GDP is $3000, which corresponds to option J.
