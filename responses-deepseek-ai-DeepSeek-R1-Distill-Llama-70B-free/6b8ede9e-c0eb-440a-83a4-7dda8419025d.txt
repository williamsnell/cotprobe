Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about swallowing, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is: "During swallowing the..." and then there are several options from A to J. I need to choose the correct one.

First, I'll try to remember the process of swallowing. Swallowing, or deglutition, is a complex process involving multiple steps and muscles. I think it's divided into two main phases: the voluntary phase and the involuntary phase.

In the first phase, the voluntary phase, the person chewed the food into a bolus. The tongue pushes the bolus towards the back of the mouth, and then the bolus is forced into the pharynx. This is where the epiglottis closes the trachea to prevent food from entering the airway.

Wait, but the question is about what happens during swallowing. Let me go through each option one by one to see which one is correct.

Option A: bronchial tubes contract. Hmm, I don't think the bronchial tubes are directly involved in swallowing. They are part of the respiratory system, branching off from the trachea into the lungs. So maybe not A.

Option B: esophagus expands. That sounds plausible. The esophagus is involved in swallowing, and it uses peristalsis to move food down. So when the bolus enters the esophagus, it does expand to allow the food to pass. But wait, during the initial phase, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, and the esophagus does expand as the bolus moves through. So B could be a possible answer.

Option C: cricopharyngeus muscle contracts. The cricopharyngeus muscle is part of the upper esophageal sphincter. I remember that during swallowing, this muscle relaxes to allow the bolus to enter the esophagus. If it contracts, that might prevent the bolus from passing. So C might be incorrect.

Option D: vocal cords vibrate. Vocal cord vibration is related to speaking or making sounds, not swallowing. During swallowing, the vocal cords actually come together to protect the airway, but I don't think they vibrate as in producing sound. So D is probably not the right choice.

Option E: auditory tube opens. The auditory tube (Eustachian tube) connects the middle ear to the back of the throat and opens during activities like yawning or swallowing to equalize pressure. So E could be a correct option. I think the auditory tube does open during swallowing to allow pressure to balance, so E is a possible answer.

Option F: rima glottis opens. The rima glottis is the opening between the vocal cords. During swallowing, the epiglottis covers the entrance to the larynx, and the vocal cords are brought together, so the rima glottis would close, not open. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: gag reflex is suspended. The gag reflex is initiated by touching the back of the throat. During swallowing, I don't think the gag reflex is suspended. In fact, the process involves the coordination of many muscles, including those that might trigger a gag if something goes wrong. So G doesn't seem right.

Option H: trachea opens. The trachea is the airway leading to the lungs. During swallowing, the epiglottis closes over the trachea to prevent food from entering. So the trachea would be closed off, not opened. So H is incorrect.

Option I: larynx descends. Wait, I think the larynx moves upward during swallowing. The larynx is pulled up by muscles, which helps in closing the airway. So if I is about descending, that's probably wrong.

Option J: uvula raises. The uvula is that hanging structure at the back of the soft palate. During swallowing, the soft palate (including the uvula) is pulled upwards to close off the nasopharynx, preventing food from entering the nasal cavity. So J is correct because the uvula does raise during swallowing.

Wait, but I thought the question was about what happens during swallowing. So let's review the options again. The question is asking which action occurs during swallowing.

So, looking at each correct option:

- B: esophagus expands. That's true as the esophagus does expand as the bolus passes through via peristalsis.

- E: auditory tube opens. This is correct as the Eustachian tube opens to equalize pressure.

- J: uvula raises. Correct because the uvula is elevated to prevent food from going into the nose.

Hmm, but the question is giving only one correct answer, so I must have made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm conflating the steps. Let's go through each option again.

Option E: The auditory tube opens during swallowing. Yes, I remember that swallowing causes the Eustachian tube to open, equalizing the pressure in the ears. So E is correct.

Option J: The uvula raises. Yes, the uvula is elevated, so J is also correct.

But the options are A-J, and the question is a single choice.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the process step by step.

During the act of swallowing:

1. The bolus is formed in the mouth.
2. The tongue pushes it back towards the pharynx.
3. The soft palate (including the uvula) elevates to close off the nasopharynx. So J is correct because the uvula raises.
4. The epiglottis closes the entrance to the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea.
5. The upper esophageal sphincter (cricopharyngeus muscle) relaxes, allowing the bolus to enter the esophagus. So C is incorrect because it's about contraction, which is the opposite.
6. The esophagus expands and uses peristalsis to move the bolus down. So B is correct.
7. The Eustachian tubes (auditory tubes) open during swallowing to equalize pressure, so E is correct.

But the question is about what happens during swallowing, and the options are separate. So the correct answer could be multiple, but the question expects only one correct choice. Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as "which of the following occurs during swallowing".

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me check the given options again.

Wait, the options are A-J, and I need to choose the correct one. So perhaps the correct answer is J: uvula raises.

Alternatively, E: auditory tube opens.

Wait, but in the process of swallowing, both E and J are correct. But the options are mutually exclusive, so perhaps only one is the intended correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option more carefully.

Option C: cricopharyngeus muscle contracts. No, during swallowing, it relaxes to allow the bolus to pass into the esophagus. So C is incorrect.

Option F: rima glottis opens. No, it's closed during swallowing. So F is incorrect.

Option I: larynx descends. No, the larynx moves upward, so I is incorrect.

So the possible correct options are B, E, and J.

But the question allows only one correct answer. So perhaps I should think about which one is a more direct action during swallowing.

Option J: uvula raises. That's a key part of the process to prevent food entering the nose.

Option E: auditory tube opens. That's also a correct process that occurs during swallowing.

Hmm, perhaps the intended correct answer is J: uvula raises.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the steps. Let me recall my notes.

During the pharyngeal phase of swallowing:

- The soft palate (including uvula) is pulled upward to close off the nasopharynx. So J is correct.

- The Eustachian tubes open, equalizing pressure. So E is correct.

- The larynx is pulled upward and the epiglottis closes the trachea.

- The upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing food into the esophagus.

So in the options given, both E and J are correct actions during swallowing. But the options are presented as single choices, so perhaps the intended answer is J: uvula raises.

Wait, but the question is "During swallowing the..." and the options are possible actions. So perhaps more than one option is correct, but the way the question is phrased, it's looking for one correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: esophagus expands, because the esophagus does expand during the process.

Wait, if I'm not certain, perhaps I should pick the option that is most directly involved in the act of swallowing.

Another approach: think about the initiation of swallowing.

When you swallow, the first thing is the oral phase, where the tongue pushes the bolus back. Then, as the bolus enters the pharynx, the soft palate elevates, closing the nasopharynx. So J is correct.

Additionally, the Eustachian tubes open, so E is correct.

But the options are given as single choices. So perhaps the question expects more than one correct option, but the way it's presented, it's multiple-choice with one correct answer.

Wait, looking back at the question, I see the options are labeled A through J, each being a separate possibility. So the correct answer could be multiple, but the question expects a single selection. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended correct answer is B: esophagus expands. Because during swallowing, the esophagus does expand as the bolus moves through, via peristalsis.

Wait, if I'm not certain, perhaps I should pick the option that is most directly related to the physical action of swallowing.

Another thought: during swallowing, the upper esophageal sphincter (cricopharyngeus) relaxes, allowing the bolus to enter. So C is incorrect because it says contracts.

The esophagus does expand as the bolus passes, so B is correct.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "During swallowing the...", and the options are actions. So perhaps all the correct actions are among the options, but the question expects the most correct or the best answer.

Alternatively, perhaps only one option is correct, and I have to choose the best one.

Given the options, I think the correct answers are B, E, and J. However, the question expects one answer, so perhaps the intended correct answer is E: auditory tube opens, as that's a specific event during swallowing to equalize ear pressure.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of the steps again.

When you swallow:

- The soft palate (uvula) rises to prevent food from entering the nose: J correct.

- The Eustachian tube opens: E correct.

- The larynx rises to protect the airway.

- The epiglottis covers the trachea.

- The upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, and the esophagus uses peristalsis, so B is correct.

So multiple options are correct, but the question allows only one choice. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is J: uvula raises.

Alternatively, the question might be testing a specific step. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, another approach: looking for the incorrect options.

A: bronchial tubes contract. Not related to swallowing, so incorrect.

D: vocal cords vibrate. That's during speech, not swallowing, so D is incorrect.

F: rima glottis opens. It's closed during swallowing, so F incorrect.

G: gag reflex suspended. No, the gag reflex is active, so G incorrect.

H: trachea opens. No, it's closed, so H incorrect.

I: larynx descends. No, it ascends, so I incorrect.

So the possible correct options are B, C, E, J.

Wait, but C says the cricopharyngeus contracts. No, during swallowing, it relaxes, so C is incorrect.

Thus, the correct options are B, E, J.

But the question is multiple-choice with single answer, so perhaps the intended answer is J: uvula raises.

Alternatively, the question might have multiple correct answers, but the way it's presented, it's expecting a single choice. So perhaps the intended answer is J.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options given in the question again. Let me list the options:

Options:

A: bronchial tubes contract.

B: esophagus expands.

C: cricopharyngeus muscle contracts.

D: vocal cords vibrate.

E: auditory tube opens.

F: rima glottis opens.

G: gag reflex is suspended.

H: trachea opens.

I: larynx descends.

J: uvula raises.

So the correct options during swallowing are:

- B: esophagus expands.

- E: auditory tube opens.

- J: uvula raises.

But the question expects one correct answer, so perhaps the intended answer is J: uvula raises.

Alternatively, another possibility is E: auditory tube opens.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me recall that during swallowing, the Eustachian tubes open, which is option E. So E is correct.

Alternatively, the action of the uvula raising is also correct. So both E and J are correct, but the question expects one answer.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is J: uvula raises.

Wait, let me think about what happens when you swallow. The uvula definitely raises. Also, the auditory tubes open. Both are correct, but I can't choose two options.

Wait, perhaps the question includes only one correct option, so I need to determine which one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

I think the correct answer is J: uvula raises because it's a key step in preventing food from entering the nasal cavity.

So, after considering all the options, I'll go with J.

During swallowing, several physiological changes occur to ensure the safe passage of food from the mouth to the esophagus while protecting the airway and equalizing pressure. Here's an analysis of the options:

- **A: Bronchial tubes contract**  
  The bronchial tubes are part of the respiratory system and are not directly involved in swallowing. This option is incorrect.

- **B: Esophagus expands**  
  The esophagus does expand during swallowing to accommodate the bolus of food, using peristalsis to move it downward. This is correct.

- **C: Cricopharyngeus muscle contracts**  
  The cricopharyngeus muscle relaxes during swallowing to allow the bolus to pass into the esophagus. This option is incorrect.

- **D: Vocal cords vibrate**  
  Vocal cord vibration is associated with speech, not swallowing. During swallowing, the vocal cords come together to protect the airway but do not vibrate. This option is incorrect.

- **E: Auditory tube opens**  
  The auditory (Eustachian) tube opens during swallowing to equalize pressure in the ears. This is correct.

- **F: Rima glottis opens**  
  The rima glottis (the opening between the vocal cords) closes during swallowing to prevent food from entering the airway. This option is incorrect.

- **G: Gag reflex is suspended**  
  The gag reflex is not suspended during swallowing; it remains active to prevent foreign objects from entering the airway. This option is incorrect.

- **H: Trachea opens**  
  The trachea is closed off during swallowing by the epiglottis to prevent food from entering the airway. This option is incorrect.

- **I: Larynx descends**  
  The larynx moves upward during swallowing to help close the airway. This option is incorrect.

- **J: Uvula raises**  
  The uvula raises during swallowing to prevent food from entering the nasal cavity. This is correct.

While both **B (esophagus expands)**, **E (auditory tube opens)**, and **J (uvula raises)** are correct, the question expects a single answer. Among these, **J: uvula raises** is the most directly associated with the act of swallowing and is the intended correct answer.

Answer: J
