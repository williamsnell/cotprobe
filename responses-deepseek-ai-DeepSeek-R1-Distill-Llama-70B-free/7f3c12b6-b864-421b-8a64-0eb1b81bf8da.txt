Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically regarding offers and when they're enforceable. Hmm, I remember that offers can be revoked under certain conditions, but some offers are irrevocable. I think the key here is to figure out which option describes an offer that can't be revoked, and which one can, making it unenforceable if the seller changes their mind before acceptance.

The question is asking which offer is not enforceable if the seller changes their mind before acceptance. So, the incorrect option here would be an offer that is revocable, meaning the seller can revoke it before the buyer accepts.

I remember that under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), which applies to the sale of goods like widgets, there are different rules for merchants. Offers made by merchants can be irrevocable under certain conditions. Specifically, if the merchant makes a written offer that includes some sort of consideration (like a payment) to keep it open, it's considered a firm offer and can't be revoked during the stated period.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: A merchant emails an offer to sell for $35k, promising to keep it open for ten days. Wait, emails are written, right? So this would be a written offer. But does it mention consideration? I don't think so. So under common law, without consideration, it's revocable unless it's a firm offer under UCC. Wait, UCC firm offers require that the offer is made by a merchant, written, and includes an irrevocability term. Also, I think there needs to be consideration, like a separate payment. Oh wait, no, under UCC 2-205, a merchant's written offer to buy or sell goods is irrevocable for a specified time (up to three months) if it's signed and includes some assurance. So maybe option A is a firm offer because it's written and from a merchant, so it's irrevocable for ten days regardless of consideration. Hmm, wait, no, because UCC 2-205 states that the offer must be in writing and signed and have some consideration or a writing that it's firm. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, UCC 2-205 says that a merchant’s written offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment is irrevocable for a specified time (not exceeding three months) if it's signed and includes some consideration or if the merchant gives a separate option agreement. So if the offer includes a promise to keep it open for ten days, and it's in writing, that might be enough without separate consideration. So option A would be a firm offer, making it irrevocable, so the seller can't revoke it. So if the seller changes mind, the offer is still enforceable. So this wouldn't be the correct answer.

Option B: Written offer without a time frame. Wait, under UCC 2-205, the offer needs to specify a time. If it doesn't, then it's not a firm offer. So without a time, the offer can be revoked. So if the seller revokes it before acceptance, the buyer can't enforce it. So this might be the correct answer because the offer is revocable.

Option C: Telegraph offer, which is a written communication, and they promise to hold it open for ten days. Telegraph is a form of writing, so similar to option A. So this would be a firm offer, making it irrevocable. So not the correct answer.

Option D: Written offer stating irrevocable for ten days. This seems to fit UCC 2-205. It's written, from a merchant, includes a time frame, so it's a firm offer. So seller can't revoke, so not the correct answer.

Option E: Verbal offer over the phone. Verbal offers are generally revocable because they're not in writing. So if the seller changes mind, the buyer can't accept. So this might be the answer. But wait, let me check the other options.

Option F: Fax offer, which is written, so similar to option A. So it's a firm offer, irrevocable. So not the answer.

Option G: Written offer stating it's irrevocable for ten days if buyer pays $2. So the buyer didn't pay. Wait, so the condition is that the buyer pays $2 for the offer to be irrevocable. But under UCC, the consideration is usually for an option contract. So if the buyer didn't pay, then the offer isn't irrevocable. So the seller can revoke it. So this offer is revocable, making it unenforceable if seller changes mind. So this could be another possible correct answer.

Option H: Written offer, irrevocable for ten days if buyer pays $1, and buyer paid. So here, the consideration was given, so it's like an option contract. So the offer is firm, can't be revoked. So not the answer.

Option I: Written offer, but no mention of time or irrevocability. So under UCC, without a specified time, the offer isn't firm. So it's revocable. So if the seller revokes, buyer can't accept.

Wait, but the question is which one is NOT enforceable. So the options where the seller can revoke before acceptance are the ones that are not enforceable.

Looking back, the options where the offer is revocable would be B, E, G, I.

Wait, but I thought UCC 2-205 says that a merchant's written offer, signed, with a time frame, is irrevocable without consideration. So in option B, the offer is written but doesn't specify a time frame. So under 2-205, the offer would not be irrevocable because it lacks a specified time. So the seller can revoke any time before acceptance, making the offer unenforceable.

Similarly, option E is verbal, so revocable. Option G, the condition wasn't met, so revocable. Option I, no time, so revocable.

So the question is asking which one is NOT enforceable, meaning the offer is revocable, so seller can change mind.

So the options are B, E, G, I.

Wait, but let me think again.

Option G: The offer says it will be irrevocable for ten days if the buyer pays $2. But the buyer didn't pay. So without payment, the offer isn't held open. So it's revocable. So if the seller revokes, buyer can't accept.

Option I: Written offer without any time or irrevocability. So under common law, without consideration, the offer is revocable unless it's a firm offer under UCC. But since it's not a firm offer (no time), the seller can revoke.

So the options that are not enforceable (because the offer can be revoked) are B, E, G, I.

Wait, but in the question, it's about which offer is NOT enforceable if the seller changes mind. So all these options are unenforceable, but the question is which one is not enforceable.

Wait, no, the question is which is not enforceable, meaning the offer is revocable, so the seller can revoke.

So the correct answer would be the one that's revocable. Now, looking back at the options, the question is which offer is not enforceable if the seller changes mind prior to acceptance.

So, which of these offers is revocable?

Option E: Verbal offer. Under common law, offers are revocable unless they're options supported by consideration. So a verbal offer without consideration is revocable. So the seller can revoke, making the offer unenforceable.

But wait, let me think about each option again.

Option A: Written, merchant, ten days. Under UCC 2-205, this is a firm offer, so irrevocable.

Option B: Written, no time. So no firm offer, revocable.

Option C: Telegraph, same as written, so firm.

Option D: Written, irrevocable, so firm.

Option E: Verbal, revocable.

Option F: Fax, same as written, so firm.

Option G: Written, but condition not met (buyer didn't pay $2), so offer is revocable.

Option H: Written, condition met (paid $1), so it's firm.

Option I: Written, no time or irrevocability, so revocable.

So the offers that are revocable (thus not enforceable if seller revokes) are B, E, G, I.

The question is which option is correct. The options are labeled A through I.

Looking back at the question, the options are A to I. The question is which offer is not enforceable.

Wait, the question asks which offer is NOT enforceable if the seller changes his mind before acceptance. So the correct answers are those where the offer is revocable.

So the answer would be the option where the offer is revocable.

Now, considering each option:

Option E is a verbal offer, which is revocable, so the offer can be revoked, making it unenforceable.

Option B is written but without a time frame. Under UCC 2-205, the offer must specify a time to be a firm offer. So without a time, it's revocable.

Similarly, option I is written without any time or irrevocability, so revocable.

So the options B, E, G, I are revocable.

But which one is the correct answer? Let me look at the answer options again.

The options are:

A: email offer, written, so firm.

B: written, no time.

C: telegraph, same as written.

D: written and irrevocable.

E: verbal.

F: fax, written.

G: written but condition not met.

H: written and condition met.

I: written, no time.

Wait, the question is which offer is NOT enforceable. So the correct answer is the one where the offer can be revoked.

So possible answers are B, E, G, I.

But the question provides options A to I, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the rules again.

Under UCC 2-205, a merchant's written offer to buy or sell goods is irrevocable for the time specified (up to three months), provided it's signed and includes some indication that it's firm. So if the offer is written, by a merchant, includes a time, then it's firm.

So in option B, the offer is written but doesn't specify a time. Therefore, it's not a firm offer, so revocable.

In option E, the offer is verbal, so revocable unless it's an option with consideration, which it's not.

Option G: The offer is written, but the condition (buyer paying $2) isn't met. So without the payment, the offer isn't held open. Therefore, it's revocable.

Option I: Written offer without any time or irrevocability. So revocable.

So the offers that are revocable are B, E, G, I.

But the question is asking which is not enforceable, so the correct answer is one of these.

Looking back at the options given, the answer is probably E, because verbal offers are generally revocable.

Wait, but let me think again. The question gives options where the seller is a merchant. So UCC applies. So perhaps the answer is B or I, because they are written but without time.

Wait, no. Let me clarify UCC 2-205. It says that a merchant's written offer becomes irrevocable if it is made in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it is firm. So the offer must include some indication that it's firm, like stating it will be held open for a certain time.

So option B's offer is written but doesn't specify a time frame. So under UCC, it's not a firm offer because it doesn't specify a time. So it's revocable.

Option I: The offer is written but doesn't state it's irrevocable or specify a time. So same as B, it's revocable.

But the options include both B and I as possible answers. So I need to figure out which one is the correct answer.

Wait, the question is which offer is NOT enforceable. So, the offer that's revocable.

Looking at the options, perhaps both B and I are revocable, but the question expects one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is to determine which offer isn't a firm offer, thus can be revoked.

Option E is a verbal offer, which is revocable. So the seller can revoke it any time before acceptance, making the offer unenforceable.

So the answer would be E.

Wait, but I thought that option B and I are also revocable. So why is E the correct answer?

Because the question is about which offer is NOT enforceable if the seller changes mind. So all these options are, but the question is multiple-choice, so which is the correct option.

Looking back, the options are:

E: A verbal offer over the phone.

Verbal offers are generally revocable unless there's consideration for an option, which there isn't here. So E is revocable.

But wait, option B is a written offer without a time frame. So under UCC, without a specified time, it's not a firm offer, so revocable.

Similarly, option I is written without time or irrevocability, so revocable.

So why is E the correct answer?

Hmm, perhaps because the question is about which is not enforceable, and E is the only option that's verbal, making it revocable, while the others are written but might have other issues.

Wait, but the options include both E and B as possible answers.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's a verbal offer, which under common law is revocable, while the others are written offers that may or may not be firm.

Wait, but under UCC, the firm offer applies to written offers by merchants. So B and I are written offers but without time, so they're not firm, thus revocable.

So the offers that are not enforceable are B, E, G, I.

But the question is which one is not enforceable, so the correct answer is E.

Wait, perhaps because under UCC, even without a time, a written offer from a merchant is firm for a reasonable time. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, UCC 2-205 requires that the offer state a time or that it's open for a reasonable time. If the offer doesn't specify a time, perhaps it's open for a reasonable time, making it firm. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's verbal, and the others are written, which could be firm offers.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently.

The question is which offer is not enforceable if the seller revokes before acceptance. So the offer must be revocable.

If the offer is revocable, then the seller can revoke, and the buyer can't enforce it.

So, which of the options are revocable?

- E: Verbal offer. Revocable at any time, so not enforceable.

- B: Written, no time. Without a specified time, under UCC, it's not a firm offer, so revocable.

- G: Written, but condition not met. So not firm, revocable.

- I: Written, no time or irrevocability. Revocable.

So all these are revocable, but the question is which option is not enforceable.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's the only verbal offer, while the others are written but may have issues. Alternatively, option B is a written offer without a time, which may still be revocable.

But I'm not 100% sure. I think the best approach is to remember that under UCC, a merchant's written offer that includes a time frame is irrevocable, but without it, it's revocable. So option B is revocable, making it not enforceable.

But I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because verbal offers are revocable, while written offers under UCC may have some firmness.

Wait, but option B is written, but without a time, so it's revocable.

I think the correct answer is E because it's verbal, thus revocable, while the others are written and may be firm or not.

But I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should look for the most clearly revocable option.

Verbal offers (option E) are generally revocable unless they're options with consideration. So E is revocable.

Option B is written but lacks a time frame, so under UCC, it's not a firm offer, making it revocable.

So both B and E are revocable.

But the question is which one is not enforceable. So perhaps both B and E are correct, but the options only allow one correct answer.

Wait, looking at the options again, the question is phrased as "which of the following offers... is not enforceable."

So the answer is the offer that can be revoked, i.e., the seller can change mind.

So among the options, E is a verbal offer, which is revocable. So E is the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option B is also revocable. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because it's the only verbal offer, and the others, even if revocable, are written but may have nuances.

I think I'll go with E as the answer because it's a verbal offer, which is revocable, making it not enforceable if the seller changes mind.
</think>

To determine which offer is not enforceable if the seller changes their mind prior to acceptance, we must analyze the revocability of each option under contract law, particularly the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) for the sale of goods. Under UCC § 2-205, a merchant's written offer is irrevocable for a specified time (up to three months) if it is signed and includes some assurance of irrevocability, such as a time frame. Verbal offers, on the other hand, are generally revocable unless supported by consideration as part of an option contract.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **A**: A written offer via email with a ten-day time frame. This qualifies as a firm offer under UCC § 2-205, making it irrevocable and enforceable.  
- **B**: A written offer without a specified time frame. Under UCC § 2-205, the lack of a time frame means it is not a firm offer and is therefore revocable, making it unenforceable if revoked.  
- **C**: A telegraph offer with a ten-day time frame. Telegraph communication is considered written, and the inclusion of a time frame makes this a firm
