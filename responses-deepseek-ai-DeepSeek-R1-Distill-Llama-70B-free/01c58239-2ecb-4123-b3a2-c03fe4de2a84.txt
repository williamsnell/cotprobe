Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a car engine and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The engine is working at 33 horsepower, and the car is moving at 45 miles per hour. I need to find the force the engine is exerting. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that horsepower is a unit of power. Power is work done over time, or in more useful terms, power equals force multiplied by velocity (P = F * v). So, if I can rearrange that formula to solve for force, that should help. Oh right, force would be power divided by velocity (F = P / v).

Wait, but I need to make sure all the units are compatible. The given power is in horsepower, and the velocity is in miles per hour. I think I need to convert horsepower to a more standard unit like foot-pounds per second or something. Oh yeah, 1 horsepower is equal to 550 foot-pounds per second, right? Because I remember that figure from somewhere.

So, the power P is 33 horsepower. Let me convert that to foot-pounds per second. So 33 hp * 550 ft-lb/s per hp. Let me calculate that. 33 times 550. Let's see, 30*550 is 16,500, and 3*550 is 1,650. So 16,500 + 1,650 equals 18,150. So P is 18,150 foot-pounds per second.

Next, the velocity is given in miles per hour. I need to convert that to feet per second because the units need to match. I remember that 1 mile is 5280 feet, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So, 45 miles per hour would be 45 * 5280 feet per 3600 seconds.

Let me compute that. 45 * 5280 = let's see, 45*5000 is 225,000, and 45*280 is 12,600. So 225,000 + 12,600 is 237,600 feet per hour. Now, per hour is 3600 seconds, so 237,600 divided by 3600. Let me do that division. 237600 / 3600. Hmm, I can simplify that. Divide numerator and denominator by 100 first: 2376 / 36. 36 goes into 2376 how many times? 36*60 is 2160, which leaves 216. 36*6 is 216, so 60 +6=66. So 237,600 / 3600 = 66 feet per second.

So now I have the velocity in feet per second (66 ft/s) and the power in foot-pounds per second (18,150 ft-lb/s). Now, using the formula F = P / v, that would be 18,150 divided by 66.

Let me compute that. 18,150 / 66. Hmm, 66 times 275 is 18,150 because 66*200 is 13,200; 66*75 is 4,950. 13,200 + 4,950 is 18,150. So F is 275 pounds.

Wait, but wait a minute. The options don't have 275 as a choice? Let me look at the options again. Oh, option J is 275 lbs. So that should be the answer. But wait, I thought I saw once that sometimes these problems use different unit conversions. Did I do everything correctly?

Let me double-check the unit conversions. 1 hp is 550 ft-lb/s, that's correct. 45 mph to feet per second: yes, 45 * 5280 = 237600 ft/hr; 237600 / 3600 = 66 ft/s. So that's right. Then 33 hp is 33 *550=18,150 ft-lb/s. So 18,150 divided by 66 is indeed 275. So yes, the force is 275 lbs. So option J is correct.

To determine the force exerted by the car engine, we start with the relationship between power, force, and velocity: 

\[
P = F \cdot v \quad \text{or equivalently} \quad F = \frac{P}{v}.
\]

### Step 1: Convert horsepower to foot-pounds per second
1 horsepower (hp) is equivalent to 550 foot-pounds per second (ft-lb/s). Therefore, the engine's power is:

\[
P = 33 \, \text{hp} \cdot 550 \, \frac{\text{ft-lb}}{\text{s}} = 18,150 \, \frac{\text{ft-lb}}{\text{s}}.
\]

### Step 2: Convert velocity to feet per second
The car's velocity is given as 45 miles per hour (mi/hr). To convert this to feet per second (ft/s):

\[
1 \, \text{mile} = 5,280 \, \text{feet}, \quad 1 \, \text{hour} = 3,600 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

\[
v = 45 \, \frac{\text{mi}}{\text{hr}} \cdot 5,280 \, \frac{\text{ft}}{\text{mi}} \cdot \frac{1}{3,600 \, \text{s}} = 66 \, \frac{\text{ft}}{\text{s}}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the force
Using the formula \( F = \frac{P}{v} \):

\[
F = \frac{18,150 \, \frac{\text{ft-lb}}{\text{s}}}{66 \, \frac{\text{ft}}{\text{s}}} = 275 \, \text{lbs}.
\]

### Final Answer
The force exerted by the engine is **275 lbs**, which corresponds to option **J**.
