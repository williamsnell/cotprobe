Question:

The pancreas secretes a large amount of digestive enzymes after a meal. Which statement about this process is correct?


Options:

A: Bile is needed to activate all pancreatic enzymes
B: All pancreatic enzymes are produced in an active form and can start digestion immediately
C: Enzymes are produced in the pancreas but released in the stomach for digestion
D: Pepsinogen is the chief enzyme which digests protein and requires removal of a peptide sequence from the active cleft before it can work
E: Pancreatic secretion of hydrochloric acid is required to provide the correct pH for maximal pancreatic enzyme in the duodenum
F: Enteropeptidase converts trypsinogen to trypsin by cleavage of a peptide sequence that blocks the active site of trypsin.
G: Pancreatic enzymes are needed to break down carbohydrates only.
H: Pancreatic รก-amylase will hydrolyse starch to free glucose

Okay, so I have this question about the pancreas and digestive enzymes. Hmm, I remember that the pancreas plays a big role in digestion by releasing enzymes. The question asks which statement is correct about the process after a meal.

Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A: Bile is needed to activate all pancreatic enzymes. Wait, I thought some enzymes are activated by bile, but not all. Like, I remember that pancreatic enzymes are usually released as zymogens, inactive forms, and need something to activate them. For example, trypsinogen is activated by enterokinase, which is in the small intestine. So A might not be correct because it says 'all' which I don't think is right.

Option B: All pancreatic enzymes are produced in active form and start digestion immediately. No, that can't be right. If they were active in the pancreas, they might digest the pancreas itself. So I think they are released as inactive zymogens and then activated in the intestine. So B is wrong.

Option C: Enzymes are produced in the pancreas but released in the stomach. No, the pancreas releases them into the small intestine via the pancreatic duct. The stomach has its own enzymes like pepsin. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Pepsinogen is the chief enzyme which digests protein and requires removal of a peptide. Wait, pepsinogen is in the stomach, right? It's converted to pepsin by HCl. But the question is about pancreatic enzymes. So D is talking about a stomach enzyme, so it's probably not the correct answer here.

Option E: Pancreatic secretion of HCl to provide pH for enzymes in duodenum. Wait, no, the pancreas doesn't secrete HCl. The stomach does that. The pancreas secretes bicarbonate to neutralize the acid when it enters the duodenum. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Enteropeptidase converts trypsinogen to trypsin by cleavage of a peptide. Yes, I remember this. Enterokinase (also called enteropeptidase) in the small intestine activates trypsinogen by cleaving a part of it, which then activates other enzymes like chymotrypsin. So F sounds correct.

Option G: Pancreatic enzymes only break down carbs. No, that's wrong. They handle proteins, carbs, and fats. Amylase for carbs, lipase for fats, and trypsin, chymotrypsin for proteins. So G is wrong.

Option H: Pancreatic amylase hydrolyses starch to free glucose. Wait, I thought amylase breaks down starch into maltose, not glucose. Because salivary amylase and pancreatic amylase both work on starch to produce shorter chains, but the final breakdown to glucose happens with enzymes in the small intestine like maltase. So H is incorrect.

So looking back, the correct answer is F. Enteropeptidase activates trypsinogen by removing a peptide that blocks the active site. That makes sense.

The correct answer is:

F: Enteropeptidase converts trypsinogen to trypsin by cleavage of a peptide sequence that blocks the active site of trypsin.

This is the correct statement about the process of pancreatic enzyme activation.

Answer: F
