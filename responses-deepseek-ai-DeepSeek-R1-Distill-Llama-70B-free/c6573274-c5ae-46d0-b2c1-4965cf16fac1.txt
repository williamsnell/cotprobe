Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these types of calculations. But I'll give it a shot. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

The problem has two parts, (a) and (b). Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with part (a): The question is about finding the number of lipid molecules in an E. coli cell. The given data is that the cell is cylindrical, 2 microns long and 1 micron in diameter. It weighs 2e-12 grams. The average molecular weight of the lipids is 700, and the lipid content is 2% of the cell's weight.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to find the total mass of lipids in the cell, then convert that mass into moles using the molecular weight, and finally convert moles to number of molecules using Avogadro's number.

Wait, right. So the steps would be:
1. Calculate the mass of lipids: 2% of the cell's weight.
2. Convert that mass into moles (moles = mass / molecular weight).
3. Multiply by Avogadro's number (6.022e23 molecules/mol) to get the number of molecules.

Let me do the calculations:

The cell's weight is 2e-12 grams. Lipid content is 2%, which is 0.02. So lipid mass = 2e-12 g * 0.02 = 4e-14 g.

Wait, 2e-12 times 0.02 is 4e-14 grams. Yes.

Now, convert that to moles. Molecular weight is 700 g/mol. So moles = 4e-14 g / 700 g/mol. Let me compute that.

4e-14 divided by 700 is approximately 5.714e-17 mol. Because 4 divided by 7 is about 0.5714, and 1e-14 / 1e2 (since 700 is 7e2) is 1e-16, so 0.5714e-16 is 5.714e-17.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 700 is 7e2. So 4e-14 / 7e2 = (4/7) * (1e-14 / 1e2) )= 0.5714 * 1e-16 = 5.714e-17 mol.

Then, number of molecules is moles multiplied by Avogadro's number. So 5.714e-17 mol * 6.022e23 molecules/mol.

Let me compute that. 5.714e-17 * 6.022e23 = (5.714 * 6.022) * 1e6. Because 10^-17 * 10^23 is 10^6.

5.714 * 6.022 is approximately... let's see. 5 * 6 is 30, 0.714*6 is about 4.284, so total around 34.284. Wait no, wait, more accurately:

5.714 * 6 = 34.284. 5.714 * 0.022 = approx 0.1257. So total is about 34.4097.

So 34.4097e6 molecules is 3.44097e7 molecules. Which is approximately 3.44e7.

Wait, but let me double-check. 5.714e-17 *6.022e23 = (5.714 *6.022) * 1e6. So 5.714 *6.022.

Wait, 5 *6=30, 5*0.022=0.11, 0.714*6=4.284, 0.714*0.022≈0.0157. So adding up:

30 + 0.11 = 30.11
30.11 +4.284=34.394
34.394 +0.0157≈34.4097.

So 34.4097 times 1e6 is 3.44097e7, which is about 3.44e7 molecules.

Looking at the options, let's see part (a) options:

Option A: 6e23 (way too big)
Option B: 1.72e8 (bigger than our result)
Option C: 5.71e7 (close to our number)
Option D:1.44e7 (smaller)
Option G:3.44e7 (exactly our number)
Wait, yes, so option G for part (a). But wait, let me check the options more carefully.

Wait the options are:

A: (a) 6.02e23, (b) 1.9%
B: (a)1.72e8, (b)2.2%
C: (a)5.71e7, (b)4.8%
D:1.44e7, 3.3%
E:5.71e-17, 3%
F:4e-14,4.5%
G:3.44e7, 2.9%
H:4.29e7, 1.5%
I:8.58e6,3.5%
J:2.86e7,5.1%

So part (a) for G is 3.44e7, which matches our calculation.

Now onto part (b): If the cell contains 15,000 ribosomes, what percent of the volume do they occupy? The ribosomes are spherical with a diameter of 180 angstroms. Also, 1e4 angstroms = 1 micron.

Wait, 1e4 angstroms is 1 micron. So 1 angstrom = 1e-4 microns. Or, 1 micron is 10^4 angstroms.

So the diameter is 180 angstroms, which is 180e-4 microns = 0.018 microns. So radius is 0.009 microns.

Wait, the cell is a cylinder with length 2 microns and diameter 1 micron, so radius 0.5 microns.

First, I think I need to compute the volume of the cell, then compute the total volume occupied by the ribosomes, then find the percentage.

So, volume of the cell (cylinder) is π r² h.

r is 0.5 microns, h is 2 microns.

So volume = π * (0.5)^2 * 2 = π * 0.25 * 2 = π * 0.5 ≈ 1.5708 cubic microns.

Now, each ribosome is a sphere with diameter 180 angstroms = 0.018 microns. So radius is 0.009 microns.

Volume of a ribosome: (4/3) π r³.

So (4/3) * π * (0.009)^3.

Compute that:

(0.009)^3 = 729e-9 = 7.29e-7 cubic microns.

Multiply by (4/3) π: (4/3)*3.1416 ≈ 4.1888.

So 4.1888 * 7.29e-7 ≈ let's compute that.

4.1888 *7.29e-7 = ?

4 *7.29e-7=2.916e-6
0.1888 *7.29e-7 ≈ approx 0.1376e-6.

Adding them together: 2.916e-6 + 0.1376e-6 ≈ 3.0536e-6 cubic microns per ribosome.

Now, there are 15,000 ribosomes. So total volume occupied is 15,000 * 3.0536e-6.

15,000 is 1.5e4.

1.5e4 * 3.0536e-6 = (1.5 *3.0536) * 1e-2.

1.5 *3.0536 is approximately 4.5804.

So 4.5804 * 0.01 = 0.045804 cubic microns.

Now, the cell's volume is about 1.5708 cubic microns.

So the percentage is (0.045804 / 1.5708) * 100.

Compute 0.045804 / 1.5708.

Let me compute that division. Let's approximate:

1.5708 is about 1.57.

0.0458 / 1.57 ≈ ?

Well, 0.0458 / 1.57 = 0.0292 approximately. Because 1.57 *0.0292 is about 0.0458.

So 0.0292 is 2.92%, which is approximately 2.9%.

Looking at the options for part (b):

Option G: (b) 2.9%, which matches our calculation.

So part (a) is 3.44e7, part (b) is 2.9%, which is option G.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, double-checking the volume of the cell:

Length is 2 microns, diameter 1 micron. So radius 0.5 microns.

Volume of cylinder: π r² h.

r=0.5, so r²=0.25. h=2.

So 0.25 *2 =0.5. π *0.5 ≈1.5708. Correct.

Volume of each ribosome: (4/3)π r³. r=0.009 microns.

r³= (0.009)^3=729e-9=7.29e-7.

Multiply by (4/3)π: 4.1888.

4.1888 *7.29e-7 = approximately 3.0536e-6. Correct.

15,000 ribosomes: 1.5e4 *3.0536e-6 = 4.5804e-2. Wait, wait wait, no: 1.5e4 * 3.0536e-6.

Wait, 3.0536e-6 is 0.0000030536.

Multiply by 1.5e4 (15,000):

15,000 * 3.0536e-6 = ?

15,000 * 3.0536e-6 = (15,000 *3.0536) *1e-6.

15,000 *3.0536 = 45,804. So 45,804 *1e-6 = 0.045804. Correct.

So 0.045804 / 1.5708 = 0.02917, which is 2.917%, so about 2.9%. So yes, part (b) is 2.9%.

Thus, the correct option is G: (a) 3.44e7, (b) 2.9%.

To solve the problem, we address each part systematically:

---

### Part (a): Number of Lipid Molecules

1. **Calculate the mass of lipids**:  
   The cell weighs \( 2 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{g} \), and the lipid content is 2% of the cell's weight.  
   \[
   \text{Lipid mass} = 2 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{g} \times 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{g}.
   \]

2. **Convert mass to moles**:  
   The molecular weight of lipids is \( 700 \, \text{g/mol} \).  
   \[
   \text{Moles of lipids} = \frac{4 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{g}}{700 \, \text{g/mol}} = 5.714 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Convert moles to molecules**:  
   Using Avogadro's number (\( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol} \)):  
   \[
   \text{Number of molecules} = 5.714 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{mol} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol} = 3.44 \times 10^{7} \, \text{molecules}.
   \]

Thus, the number of lipid molecules is approximately \( 3.44 \times 10^{7} \).

---

### Part (b): Percentage of Cell Volume Occupied by Ribosomes

1. **Calculate the volume of the cell**:  
   The cell is cylindrical with a length of \( 2 \, \mu\text{m} \) and a diameter of \( 1 \, \mu\text{m} \), so the radius is \( 0.5 \, \mu\text{m} \).  
   The volume of a cylinder is given by:  
   \[
   V_{\text{cell}} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (0.5)^2 (2) = \pi (0.25) (2) = 1.5708 \, \mu\text{m}^3.
   \]

2. **Calculate the volume of one ribosome**:  
   Ribosomes are spherical with a diameter of \( 180 \, \text{Å} = 0.018 \, \mu\text{m} \), so the radius is \( 0.009 \, \mu\text{m} \).  
   The volume of a sphere is given by:  
   \[
   V_{\text{ribosome}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (0.009)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (7.29 \times 10^{-7}) \approx 3.0536 \times 10^{-6} \, \mu\text{m}^3.
   \]

3. **Calculate the total volume of 15,000 ribosomes**:  
   \[
   V_{\text{total ribosomes}} = 15,000 \times 3.0536 \times 10^{-6} = 4.5804 \times 10^{-2} \, \mu\text{m}^3.
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of the cell volume occupied by ribosomes**:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{V_{\text{total ribosomes}}}{V_{\text{cell}}} \times 100 = \frac{4.5804 \times 10^{-2}}{1.5708} \times 100 \approx 2.9\%.
   \]

---

### Final Answer

From the calculations:  
- Part (a): \( 3.44 \times 10^{7} \, \text{lipid molecules} \).  
- Part (b): \( 2.9\% \, \text{of the cell volume occupied by ribosomes} \).  

The correct option is **G**.
