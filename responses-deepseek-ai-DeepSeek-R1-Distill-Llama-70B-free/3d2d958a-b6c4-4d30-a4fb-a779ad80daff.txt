Okay, so I've got this integral to compute: the double integral of xy squared over a rectangle D. The rectangle is defined by x between 0 and 2, and y between 0 and 1. Hmm, I'm a bit new to double integrals, but I think I can figure this out.

Wait, double integrals can sometimes be broken down into iterated integrals, right? So I can probably write this as an integral with respect to x first and then y, or vice versa. I'm not sure which order is easier, but maybe I should just pick one and see how it goes.

Let me write it out. So the integral is the integral from x=0 to x=2, and for each x, y goes from 0 to 1. So it's like ∫ (from 0 to 2) ∫ (from 0 to 1) of x*y² dy dx. Yeah, that makes sense. Alternatively, I could switch the order, but I think this order is manageable.

First, I'll tackle the inner integral, which is with respect to y. So integrating x*y² dy. Wait, x is treated as a constant when integrating with respect to y, right? So the integral of y squared dy is (y^3)/3. Oh wait, so the inner integral becomes x*(y^3/3) evaluated from y=0 to y=1.

Let me calculate that. At y=1, it's x*(1/3), and at y=0, it's zero. So the inner integral simplifies to x/3.

Now, the outer integral is the integral from x=0 to x=2 of (x/3) dx. That should be straightforward. So integrating x/3 dx is (1/3)*(x²/2) evaluated from 0 to 2.

Calculating that, it's (1/3)*( (2²)/2 - 0 ) which is (1/3)*(4/2) = (1/3)*2 = 2/3. Wait, 2/3 is approximately 0.66667.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.66667, which matches my calculation. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, did I do everything correctly? Let me double-check. The inner integral: ∫ y² dy from 0 to 1 is indeed [y³/3] from 0 to1, which is 1/3. Multiply by x (which is treated as a constant in the inner integral), so x/3. Then integrating that from 0 to 2 gives (x²/6) from 0 to 2. So (4/6 - 0) = 2/3. Yep, that's correct.

To compute the integral $\iint_D xy^2 \, dA$ over the rectangle $D$ defined by $0 \leq x \leq 2$ and $0 \leq y \leq 1$, we can express it as an iterated integral:

$$
\int_{0}^{2} \int_{0}^{1} xy^2 \, dy \, dx.
$$

### Step 1: Compute the inner integral with respect to $y$
Treat $x$ as a constant when integrating with respect to $y$:
$$
\int_{0}^{1} xy^2 \, dy = x \int_{0}^{1} y^2 \, dy = x \left[ \frac{y^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{1}.
$$
Evaluating this:
$$
x \left( \frac{1^3}{3} - \frac{0^3}{3} \right) = \frac{x}{3}.
$$

### Step 2: Compute the outer integral with respect to $x$
Now integrate $\frac{x}{3}$ with respect to $x$ over the interval $[0, 2]$:
$$
\int_{0}^{2} \frac{x}{3} \, dx = \frac{1}{3} \int_{0}^{2} x \, dx = \frac{1}{3} \left[ \frac{x^2}{2} \right]_{0}^{2}.
$$
Evaluating this:
$$
\frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{2^2}{2} - \frac{0^2}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{2} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 2 = \frac{2}{3}.
$$

### Final Answer
The value of the integral is $\frac{2}{3}$, which is approximately $0.66667$. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D: 0.66667**
