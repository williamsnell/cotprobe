Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about embryology. The question is about where the embryos of terrestrial vertebrates get their fluid to prevent desiccation and injury. The options are A through J, each a different term.

Alright, I remember that terrestrial animals, like humans and other mammals, have some structures that help protect the embryo. I think these structures form a sort of cushioning or fluid-filled space. Let me think about the terms.

I recall that the amnion is a membrane that encloses the embryo and forms a fluid-filled cavity called the amniotic cavity. The amniotic fluid is what surrounds the embryo, protecting it from drying out and physical shocks. So the amnion must be the source of that fluid.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing this up with other structures. The chorion is another membrane, right? It's part of the placenta in mammals, but I think it's more about gas exchange and providing nutrients. The yolk sac is involved in early nutrition before the placenta takes over, so that's probably not it.

The blastoderm is the layer of cells in early development that forms the embryo, so maybe not directly related to the fluid. Mesoderm, ectoderm, and endoderm are the primary germ layers, so they form tissues but don't secrete the fluid themselves.

Zona pellucida is a glycoprotein layer around the oocyte, I think. It's more about the egg before fertilization, so probably not involved in the embryo's fluid after implantation.

Vitelline membrane is another term I've heard, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's related to the yolk sac. Allantois is involved in waste storage and sometimes forms part of the umbilical cord, but again, not the fluid around the embryo.

So putting it all together, the amnion is the membrane that secretes amniotic fluid, which prevents desiccation and injury. Therefore, the correct answer should be C: amnion.

The embryos of terrestrial vertebrates are protected from desiccation and injury by a fluid-filled cavity. This fluid is secreted by the amnion, a membrane that encloses the embryo and forms the amniotic cavity. The amniotic fluid within this cavity provides the necessary protection. Other structures, such as the chorion, yolk sac, and allantois, serve different roles like gas exchange, nutrition, and waste storage, but the amnion is specifically responsible for the protective fluid.

Answer: C
