Okay, so I've got this question about Dalmatian puppies. Hmm, I remember that Dalmatians are known for their spots, but I'm not sure about the colors when they're born. Let me think...

Wait, I think when Dalmatians are puppies, they aren't born with spots. Oh right, I remember now! They're actually born with a solid color coat. But which color is that? I think it's either all white or all black. Or maybe another color... No, wait, I'm pretty sure they start off as one color and develop spots later.

I've heard that Dalmatian puppies are all white when they're born, and then the spots come in as they grow. So the question is asking about their color at birth. The options are A to J, with choices like white, black, brown, etc.

Looking at the options, F is 'white' and H is 'black with white spots'. Since they're born without spots, H can't be right because it includes spots. So F seems like the correct choice. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I might be mixing this up with other breeds.

Wait, another thought: I think some sources say Dalmatian puppies are born with a solid coat, but not necessarily all white. Or maybe it's white with some patches. No, I'm pretty sure it's all white. They start developing spots after a few weeks. So the answer should be white, which is option F.

But looking back at the options, option C is 'white with black spots' and option I is 'white with brown spots'. Since they're born without spots, those can't be right. So the only option that fits is F: white.

Wait, but I've also heard that some might have a slight marking, but generally, they are born white. So yes, the correct answer should be F.

The correct answer is F: white. Dalmatian puppies are born without spots and have a solid white coat at birth. The spots develop later as they mature.
