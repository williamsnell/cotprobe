Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about verbal stimuli as an acquired source of drive. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me break it down.

The question is asking whether verbal stimuli can be an acquired source of drive. From what I remember in psychology, drive theory suggests that drives are motivations that push us to fulfill certain needs. Drives can be primary (innate, like hunger) or secondary (learned through experience).

Verbal stimuli are language-based, like words or phrases. So the question is whether these can serve as a drive that's acquired, meaning learned. I think this relates to how we learn to respond to certain verbal cues because of the experiences we've had.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Verbal cues only work in specific cultural contexts. Well, culture does influence language, so maybe this is true, but I'm not sure if it's the best answer. The question is more about whether they can be an acquired source, not specifically about cultural limitations.

Option B: Only non-verbal stimuli can serve as drive sources. That doesn't sound right. I remember that verbal can be motivators too, like praise.

Option C: Verbal stimuli only work in early childhood. No, that's not correct. People of all ages respond to verbal cues.

Option D: Verbal stimuli are innate, not acquired. No, because language is learned, so they're acquired, not innate.

Option E: Verbal aren't an acquired source. Again, I think they are, so E would be incorrect.

Option F: Verbal only affect animals. No, humans definitely respond to verbal stimuli.

Option G: They only work with physical reinforcement. Maybe sometimes, but I think verbal can be reinforcing on their own through learning, like praise making someone feel good.

Option H: Verbal have no motivational properties. That's not right because they do motivate. Think about a coach encouraging a team.

Option I: Language has no influence on behavior. Clearly false; language shapes a lot of behavior.

Option J: Certain verbal cues become motivational through learned responses. Yes, this makes sense. Like when a phrase becomes associated with positive outcomes, it drives behavior.

So putting it all together, the correct answer must be J. It aligns with the idea that through learning and associations, verbal cues can motivate. They're acquired through experiences, not innate.

The correct answer is J. Verbal stimuli can indeed serve as an acquired source of drive, primarily through learned responses. These cues become motivational as individuals associate them with certain outcomes or emotions, shaping their behavior over time.

J: Certain verbal cues may become acquired motivational sources, mainly through the learned responses that they evoke.

Answer: J
