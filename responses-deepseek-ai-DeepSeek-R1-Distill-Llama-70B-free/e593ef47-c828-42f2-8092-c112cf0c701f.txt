Question:

Traders in major financial institutions use the Black-Scholes formula in a backward fashion to infer other traders' estimation of $\sigma$ from option prices. In fact, traders frequently quote sigmas to each other, rather than prices, to arrange trades. Suppose a call option on a stock that pays no dividend for 6 months has a strike price of $35, a premium of $2.15, and time to maturity of 7 weeks. The current short-term T-bill rate is 7%, and the price of the underlying stock is $36.12. What is the implied volatility of the underlying security?

Options:

A: 0.275
B: 0.225
C: 0.165
D: 0.195
E: 0.210
F: 0.350
G: 0.300
H: 0.180
I: 0.320
J: 0.251

Okay, so I've got this question about implied volatility using the Black-Scholes model. Hmm, I remember that the Black-Scholes formula is used to calculate the price of a call option, but here they're using it backward to find the implied volatility. Right, because the market price is given, so we solve for sigma, which is the volatility.

Let me list the given data:

- The call option has a strike price (K) of $35.
- The premium (C) is $2.15.
- Time to maturity (T) is 7 weeks. Oh wait, I need to convert that into years because the Black-Scholes formula uses annualized time. So 7 weeks is roughly 7/52 years. Let me calculate that: 7 divided by 52 is approximately 0.1346 years. I'll note that as T ≈ 0.1346.

- The risk-free rate (r) is 7%, so that's 0.07. But wait, since the time is in years, it's already annualized, so that's correct.

- The stock price (S) is $36.12, and there's no dividend, so q=0.

The formula for the Black-Scholes call option is:

C = S*N(d1) - K*e^(-rT) * N(d2)

Where d1 = [ln(S/K) + (r + sigma^2/2)T] / (sigma * sqrt(T))
And d2 = d1 - sigma * sqrt(T)

Our goal is to find sigma, which is the implied volatility. Since the formula isn't linear in sigma, we can't solve it algebraically. So we'll need to use an iterative method, like trial and error or the Newton-Raphson method. But since this is a problem to solve manually, I'll probably have to plug in the options and see which one gives the closest call price to $2.15.

The options given for sigma are A through J, with the values ranging from about 0.165 to 0.35. Let's list them:

A: 0.275
B: 0.225
C: 0.165
D: 0.195
E: 0.210
F: 0.350
G: 0.300
H: 0.180
I: 0.320
J: 0.251

Hmm, okay, I'll need to compute C for each sigma and find which one gives around 2.15. Let's get started.

First, let's compute the constants:

S = 36.12
K = 35
T = 0.1346 years
r = 0.07
q = 0

Let me compute ln(S/K): ln(36.12/35) = ln(1.034914). Let's see, ln(1.03) is about 0.02956, so 0.0349 is a bit higher. Let me calculate it more accurately.

I know that ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x^3/3... for small x, but maybe I should just compute it directly. Alternatively, I remember that ln(1.0349) is approximately 0.0344 because e^0.0344 ≈ 1.0349. Let me double-check that with a calculator. Well, e^0.0344 is about 1.0349, so yes, so ln(1.0349)=0.0344 approximately.

So ln(S/K)=0.0344.

Now, each sigma will change d1 and d2, so let's start with one of the options.

Let me pick option D: 0.195.

Compute d1:

d1 = [0.0344 + (0.07 + (0.195)^2 / 2) * 0.1346 ] / (0.195 * sqrt(0.1346))

Let's break it down.

First, calculate (0.195)^2: 0.195 * 0.195 = 0.038025. Divide by 2: 0.0190125.

So, (0.07 + 0.0190125) = 0.0890125.

Multiply by T=0.1346: 0.0890125 * 0.1346 ≈ Let's compute 0.089 * 0.1346. 0.08 * 0.13 is 0.0104, 0.009 * 0.1346 is about 0.00121, so total ≈ 0.01161. So the numerator's first part inside [ ] is 0.0344 + 0.01161 = 0.04601.

Now the denominator is sigma * sqrt(T). So sqrt(0.1346) is approximately sqrt(0.16) is 0.4, but 0.1346 is about 0.367. Let me compute sqrt(0.1346): Let's see, 0.367^2 is 0.134. So sqrt(0.1346) ≈ 0.367.

So denominator is 0.195 * 0.367 ≈ 0.0716.

So d1 = 0.04601 / 0.0716 ≈ 0.642.

Now compute d2 = d1 - sigma * sqrt(T) = 0.642 - (0.195 * 0.367) = 0.642 - 0.0716 ≈ 0.5704.

Now, find N(d1) and N(d2). The standard normal distribution values.

Looking up N(0.64): I remember that N(0.6)=0.7257, N(0.7)=0.7580. So 0.64 is in between. Let me interpolate.

The z-table gives:

For z=0.64, cumulative probability is approximately 0.7389. Similarly, for z=0.57, it's about 0.7157.

Wait, let me check more accurately. The exact values:

z=0.64: The standard normal table gives 0.7389.

z=0.57: 0.7157.

So N(d1)=0.7389, N(d2)=0.7157.

Now compute the call price:

C = S*N(d1) - K*e^(-rT) * N(d2)

Compute each term:

S*N(d1) = 36.12 * 0.7389 ≈ Let's calculate 36 * 0.7389 is about 26.58, 0.12 * 0.7389 ≈ 0.0887, so total ≈26.58 + 0.0887≈26.6687.

K*e^(-rT)*N(d2): K is 35, e^(-0.07*0.1346). Let's compute exponent: 0.07 * 0.1346 ≈0.00942. So e^-0.00942 ≈ 1 -0.00942 + (0.00942)^2/2 ≈ approx 0.9906 (since e^-x ≈1 -x for small x). Alternatively, using a calculator, e^-0.00942 is approximately 0.9906.

So 35 * 0.9906 * 0.7157.

Compute 35 * 0.9906 first: 35 * 0.99 is 34.65, plus 35 *0.0006=0.021 → 34.671.

Now multiply by 0.7157: 34.671 * 0.7157.

Let me compute 34.671 * 0.7 = 24.2697; 34.671 *0.0157 ≈ 0.544. So total ≈24.2697 + 0.544≈24.8137.

So the call price C ≈26.6687 -24.8137≈1.855.

But the given premium is 2.15, so this sigma (0.195) gives a lower C than 2.15. So we need a higher sigma because with higher sigma, the call price increases.

Wait, let me think: Higher sigma increases the probability of the stock price going up, so the call option is more valuable. So if with sigma=0.195, we get C≈1.855, which is less than 2.15, we need a higher sigma to increase C.

So let's try a higher sigma. Let's pick option E: 0.210.

Compute d1 again with sigma=0.210.

d1 = [0.0344 + (0.07 + (0.210)^2 / 2) * T ] / (0.210 * sqrt(T)).

Compute (0.210)^2=0.0441; divided by 2 is 0.02205.

So (0.07 + 0.02205)=0.09205.

Multiply by T=0.1346: 0.09205 * 0.1346 ≈ Let me compute 0.09 * 0.1346=0.012114. 0.00205 *0.1346≈0.0002756. So total≈0.012114+0.0002756≈0.01239.

So numerator inside [ ] is 0.0344 + 0.01239=0.04679.

Denominator is 0.210 * sqrt(0.1346)=0.210 * 0.367≈0.077.

So d1=0.04679 / 0.077≈0.6073.

d2= d1 - sigma*sqrt(T)=0.6073 - (0.210 * 0.367)=0.6073 - 0.077≈0.5303.

Now N(d1)=N(0.6073). Let me think, N(0.6)=0.7257, N(0.61)=0.7330, N(0.6073) is about 0.7285. Similarly, N(0.5303) is about N(0.53)=0.7019.

So N(d1)=~0.7285 and N(d2)=0.7019.

Compute C = S*N(d1) - K*e^(-rT)*N(d2).

S*N(d1)=36.12 * 0.7285≈ Let's see: 36 * 0.7285≈26.226, 0.12 *0.7285≈0.0874. So total≈26.226 + 0.0874≈26.3134.

K*e^(-rT)*N(d2): K=35, e^(-0.07*0.1346)= same as before, about 0.9906.

So 35 * 0.9906 *0.7019.

Compute 35 *0.9906≈34.671.

34.671 * 0.7019≈ Let me compute 34.671 *0.7=24.2697, 34.671*0.0019≈0.0658. So total≈24.2697 + 0.0658≈24.3355.

So C≈26.3134 -24.3355≈1.9779.

Still lower than 2.15. So we need a higher sigma.

Next, try option A: 0.275.

Compute d1 with sigma=0.275.

d1 = [0.0344 + (0.07 + (0.275)^2/2)*T ] / (0.275 * sqrt(T)).

(0.275)^2=0.075625, so /2=0.0378125.

0.07 + 0.0378125=0.1078125.

Multiply by T=0.1346: 0.1078125 * 0.1346 ≈ Let's compute 0.1 *0.1346=0.01346, 0.0078125 *0.1346≈ approx 0.001051. So total≈0.01346 + 0.001051≈0.014511.

So numerator: 0.0344 + 0.014511≈0.048911.

Denominator: 0.275 *0.367≈0.275 *0.367. 0.2 *0.367=0.0734, 0.075 *0.367≈0.027525, so total≈0.0734 +0.027525≈0.1009.

So d1=0.048911 / 0.1009≈0.4848.

d2=0.4848 - (0.275 * 0.367)=0.4848 - 0.1009≈0.3839.

Now, find N(d1)=N(0.4848). Let's see, N(0.48)=0.6844, N(0.49)=0.6879. So 0.4848 is around 0.6844 + (0.0048/0.01)*(0.6879-0.6844). So 0.0048/0.01=0.48, so 0.6844 + 0.48*(0.0035)=0.6844 + 0.00168≈0.6861.

N(d2)=N(0.3839). N(0.38)=0.6480, N(0.39)=0.6517. 0.3839 is 0.38 + 0.0039. So 0.0039/0.01=0.39, so 0.6480 + 0.39*(0.6517-0.6480)=0.6480+0.39*(0.0037)=0.6480+0.00144≈0.6494.

Now compute C:

S*N(d1)=36.12 * 0.6861≈ Let's compute 36 * 0.6861=24.6696, 0.12 *0.6861≈0.0823. So total≈24.6696 +0.0823≈24.7519.

K * e^(-rT) * N(d2)=35 *0.9906 *0.6494.

35 *0.9906≈34.671.

34.671 *0.6494≈ Let's compute 34.671 *0.6=20.8026, 34.671 *0.04=1.3868, 34.671 *0.0094≈0.326.

So total≈20.8026 +1.3868=22.1894 +0.326≈22.5154.

So C≈24.7519 -22.5154≈2.2365.

Hmm, that's higher than 2.15. So with sigma=0.275, C≈2.2365.

Earlier, with sigma=0.210, C≈1.9779.

We need a sigma that gives C=2.15. So it's between sigma=0.210 and 0.275.

Wait, but wait, let me check if I did the calculation correctly because 0.275 seems high, and the options include some in between values, like option J is 0.251.

Let me try option J: sigma=0.251.

Compute d1:

sigma=0.251.

d1 = [0.0344 + (0.07 + (0.251)^2/2)*T ] / (0.251 * sqrt(T)).

(0.251)^2=0.063001; /2=0.0315005.

0.07 + 0.0315005=0.1015005.

Multiply by T=0.1346: 0.1015005 *0.1346≈ Let's compute 0.1 *0.1346=0.01346, 0.0015005 *0.1346≈0.0002017. So total≈0.01346 +0.0002017≈0.01366.

So numerator: 0.0344 +0.01366=0.04806.

Denominator:0.251 *0.367≈0.0920.

So d1=0.04806 /0.0920≈0.5223.

d2=0.5223 - (0.251 *0.367)=0.5223 -0.0921≈0.4302.

Now, N(d1)=N(0.5223). Let's see, N(0.52)=0.6985, N(0.53)=0.7019. So 0.5223 is 0.52 +0.0023; so approx 0.6985 + (0.0023/0.01)*(0.7019-0.6985)=0.6985 +0.23*(0.0034)=0.6985+0.00078≈0.6993.

N(d2)=N(0.4302). N(0.43)=0.6664, N(0.44)=0.6700. 0.4302 is 0.43 +0.0002. So approx 0.6664 + (0.0002/0.01)*(0.6700-0.6664)=0.6664 +0.02*(0.0036)=0.6664 +0.000072≈0.6665.

Now compute C:

S*N(d1)=36.12 * 0.6993≈ Let's compute 36 *0.6993=25.1948, 0.12 *0.6993≈0.0839. Total≈25.1948 +0.0839≈25.2787.

K * e^(-rT) * N(d2): 35 *0.9906 *0.6665.

35 *0.9906≈34.671.

34.671 *0.6665≈ Let's compute 34.671 *0.6=20.8026, 34.671 *0.06=2.0803, 34.671 *0.0065≈0.2254. So total≈20.8026 +2.0803=22.8829 +0.2254≈23.1083.

So C≈25.2787 -23.1083≈2.1704.

That's pretty close to 2.15. But it's a bit higher. So sigma=0.251 gives C≈2.
