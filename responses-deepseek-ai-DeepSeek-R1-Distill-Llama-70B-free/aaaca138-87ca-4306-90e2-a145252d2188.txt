Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about keyboard functions. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is asking which of the options is not a 'lock' function on a standard desktop computer keyboard. The options are A through D: print lock, scroll lock, caps lock, and number lock.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what each of these does. I know that on a standard QWERTY keyboard, there are several lock keys. The most familiar ones are Caps Lock, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock. These are the ones I've used before.

Caps Lock is straightforwardâ€”it makes all the letters you type uppercase. When it's on, the Caps Lock light is usually on, and pressing it again turns it off. That one's definitely a lock function.

Number Lock or Num Lock is another one. This controls whether the numpad on the right side of the keyboard types numbers or the alternate functions like Home, End, Page Up, etc. When Num Lock is on, you get numbers, and when it's off, you get those navigation keys. So that's another lock function.

Scroll Lock is a bit less common these days, but I remember it's used in some applications to control scrolling behavior. For example, in Excel, when Scroll Lock is on, arrow keys scroll the view instead of moving the cell cursor. Some people might not use this much, but it's definitely a lock key on the keyboard.

Now, the tricky part is option A: print lock. I don't recall a Print Lock key on standard keyboards. Wait, wasn't there a Print Screen key? Print Screen, often abbreviated as PrtScn, is used to capture screenshots. But Print Lock doesn't ring a bell. Maybe it's referring to something else, but I don't think Print Lock is a standard lock function.

So, putting it all together, the lock functions are Caps Lock, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock. Print Lock isn't a standard function, so option A must be the correct answer.
