Okay, so I've got this problem here about buying a bicycle on an installment plan. Let me see if I can figure this out. The bicycle costs $82, and there's no down payment, but there's a 10% per year finance charge. I need to find out how much each monthly payment should be to pay it off in six months. Hmm.

Wait, so the total cost isn't just $82 because there's a finance charge. Finance charge is like interest, right? Since it's 10% per year, but the payment is over six months, which is half a year. So I guess I need to calculate the interest for half a year.

Let me think, 10% per annum is the rate. So for six months, that's half of 10%, which is 5% interest. So the interest amount would be 5% of $82. Let me calculate that. 5% is 0.05, so 82 * 0.05 equals... let's see, 82*0.05 is $4.10. So the total amount to pay back is 82 plus 4.10, which is $86.10.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the finance charge calculated differently? Some installment plans calculate interest on the initial amount each month, while others might use the remaining balance each period. Oh, right, this probably uses simple interest, since it's a short period (six months) and the problem doesn't mention compound interest. So I think my initial approach is correct.

So the total amount owed is $86.10. Now, this needs to be paid in six equal monthly payments. So each payment would be 86.10 divided by 6. Let me do that division. 86.10 /6 equals... 6 goes into 86 fourteen times (14*6=84), remainder 2. Bring down the 1, making it 21. 6 into 21 is 3, so 14.3 with a remainder of 3. Then the next digit is 0, so 30 divided by 6 is 5. So that gives me $14.35 per month?

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 6 times 14 is 84, subtract from 86, leaves 2. Bring down 1, that's 21. 6 into 21 is 3, so 3, making it 14.3 so far. Then bring down the 0 (since it's 86.10), giving 30. 6 into 30 is 5. So yes, 14.35. So each payment is $14.35.

Looking at the options, option G is $14.35. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait another thought. Sometimes, the finance charge is calculated monthly but expressed as an annual rate. Let me think about that. Oh, right, the problem says a 10% per year finance charge. So that's the annual rate, but the payments are monthly over six months. So perhaps the monthly interest rate is 10% divided by 12, which is approximately 0.8333% per month. But that's if it's compounded monthly. But in this case, since it's a six-month installment, perhaps the interest is calculated as simple interest for six months.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The problem says there's a 10% per year finance charge, but it doesn't specify how it's applied. So two approaches come to mind: either the total interest is 10% annually, so for six months, it's 5% (as I did before), or the monthly interest is 10%/12, and then compounded each month for six months.

Wait, the problem says "no down-payment, but a 10% per year finance charge." So perhaps the way it's applied is that each month, the outstanding balance is charged 10% per annum, which would be (10%/12) per month. But for six months, it's possible that it's simple interest, not compound.

Wait, another approach: The total interest over six months is 10% per annum * (6/12) = 5%. So the total to pay is 82 * 1.05 = 86.10. Then, each payment is 86.10 /6 = 14.35, which is option G.

Alternatively, if it's compound interest, but over six months, but I don't think so because usually for such short terms, it's simple interest unless stated otherwise.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the simple interest method, so 5% on $82. Then, as I calculated before, the monthly payment is $14.35. So the correct answer should be G.

But wait, another way to approach this is using the installment loan formula. The formula for monthly payments when there's interest involved is similar to the amortization formula.

The formula is: M = P * [i(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n -1]

Where:
M = monthly payment
P = principal ($82)
i = monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12)
n = number of payments (6)

Wait, but the problem says the finance charge is 10% per year. So is that the annual interest rate? So i would be 10% /12 = 0.0083333 per month.

Plugging in the numbers:

M = 82 * [0.0083333*(1+0.0083333)^6] / [(1+0.0083333)^6 -1]

Let me compute (1+0.0083333)^6. Let me compute that step by step.

First, 0.0083333 is 1/120, so 1 + 1/120 is 121/120.

(121/120)^6. Hmm, that's a bit tedious, but perhaps I can approximate it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute numerically.

Compute 1.0083333^6:

Let me compute step by step:

1.0083333^1 = 1.0083333

^2: 1.0083333 * 1.0083333 ≈ 1.0167361

^3: 1.0167361 * 1.0083333 ≈ 1.025138

^4: 1.025138 * 1.0083333 ≈ 1.03363

^5: 1.03363 * 1.0083333 ≈ 1.04218

^6: 1.04218 * 1.0083333 ≈ 1.05079 (approximately 1.0508)

So (1.0083333)^6 ≈ 1.0508.

So numerator is 0.0083333 * 1.0508 ≈ 0.00875.

Denominator is 1.0508 -1 = 0.0508.

So M ≈ 82 * (0.00875 / 0.0508) ≈ 82 * 0.1722 ≈ let's calculate that.

82 * 0.1722: 80 *0.1722=13.776, 2*0.1722=0.3444, total is 14.1204.

So approximately $14.12 per month. Hmm, but none of the options are exactly that. The options are G:14.35, F:14.85, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the finance charge is 10% for six months, not annual. Let me read the question again.

The question says "a 10% per year finance charge." So it's an annual rate of 10%, but the loan is for six months. So when calculating the interest, perhaps it's 10% * (6/12) = 5% simple interest.

Then, the total amount is 82 * 1.05 =86.10, as I had before. Then, divided by 6, gives 14.35, which is option G.

So perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, but earlier when I used the installment formula, I got about 14.12, which is not exactly one of the options. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps because in the installment plan, the interest is calculated each month on the outstanding balance, which would be compound interest. So that's why the two methods give different results.

Wait, but the problem says "finance charge", which might imply a simple interest calculation. So perhaps the correct approach is the simple interest method, leading to option G.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the simple interest approach. Let me think again. The problem states: "no down-payment, but a 10% per year finance charge." So I think the finance charge is 10% annually, so for six months, it's 5% of the principal.

Thus, total amount is 82 + (0.10 *82 *0.5) = 82 +4.1=86.1.

Then, monthly payment is 86.1 /6 =14.35, which is option G.

So the answer is G.

To determine the monthly payment for the bicycle, we start by calculating the total amount owed, including the finance charge. The bicycle costs $82, and the finance charge is 10% per year. Since the payment period is six months (half a year), the interest rate for this period is 5% (10% annually × 6/12). 

The interest amount is calculated as:

\[
\text{Interest} = 82 \times 0.05 = 4.10
\]

Adding this to the principal, the total amount owed is:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = 82 + 4.10 = 86.10
\]

To pay off the bicycle in six months, the total amount is divided into six equal monthly payments:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{86.10}{6} = 14.35
\]

Thus, each monthly payment should be $14.35. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**G: $14.35**
