Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about Sandel's case against moral engineering. Let me start by recalling what I know about Michael Sandel and his views. I remember that Sandel is a political philosopher who has written a lot about justice and ethics. In his book "The Case Against Perfection," he critiques what he calls "moral engineering," which I think refers to the use of technology, especially genetic engineering, to enhance human traits. 

Sandel's argument is that such engineering could undermine our humanity and the way we view human life. He's concerned about the hyper-agency this gives us, where we try to control and design life in ways that might erode the sense of the giftedness of lifeâ€”the idea that we don't get to choose everything about ourselves, which is part of what makes life meaningful.

Now, I need to connect this to the ethical theories listed in the options. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Ethics of care. That's more about relationships and care as a moral value, so I don't think that's directly related to Sandel's argument here.

Option B: Natural law theory. This approach is about moral laws derived from nature, often tied to religious or classical philosophical thought. Sandel might touch on ideas about natural limits, but I'm not sure if that's the best fit.

Option C: Ethics of prima facie duty. This is W.D. Ross's theory, which talks about duties that are binding unless overridden by another duty. Not sure how that applies directly here.

Option D: Deontological approach. Deontology focuses on duties, rules, and the rightness of actions regardless of consequences. Sandel might be more about the inherent wrongness of certain actions, like engineering humans, which could fit a deontological view.

Option E: Existentialist approach. Existentialism is more about individual freedom and choice. While Sandel's critique might involve individual choices, I don't think existentialism is the main framework here.

Option F: Virtue ethics approach. Virtue ethics focuses on character traits and the good life. Sandel's critique is more about the moral limits on certain actions, so maybe not directly about virtues.

Option G: Relativist approach. Relativism is about moral standards varying across cultures. Sandel's argument seems more universal, not relative.

Option H: Kantian approach. Kantian ethics is a type of deontology, emphasizing duty, the categorical imperative, and treating people as ends in themselves. Sandel's concern about respecting human dignity could be linked to Kantian ideas.

Option I: Consequentialist approach. This looks at the outcomes of actions. Sandel is arguing against the practice on more intrinsic grounds, not just the consequences.

Option J: Utilitarian approach. This is a form of consequentialism, focusing on maximizing overall happiness. Again, Sandel's stance seems more about the inherent wrongness of the action, not the overall utility.

So, considering all this, Sandel's argument is against using technology to engineer humans in a way that violates certain moral boundaries. He's more concerned with the rightness or wrongness of the action itself rather than the outcomes. That sounds like a deontological approach, which focuses on duties and the inherent rightness of actions.

Wait, but I also thought about the Kantian approach. Deontology is a broader category, and Kant is a specific deontologist. So if the options include both D (deontological) and H (Kantian), which is more accurate?

Sandel's arguments often resonate with Kantian ideas about treating people as ends rather than means. For example, genetic engineering might be seen as treating people as products rather than respecting their inherent dignity. So maybe H is the better choice.

I'm a bit torn between D and H. But I think Sandel's critique aligns more with a Kantian perspective because it's about respecting human dignity and the moral law, rather than just any duty-based approach.

So I'll go with H: a Kantian approach.

Sandel's case against moral engineering, particularly his critique of genetic enhancement in "The Case Against Perfection," centers on the idea that such practices undermine human dignity and the meaningfulness of life. He argues that treating human traits as objects of design erodes the sense of life's giftedness and violates moral boundaries. This aligns with Kantian ethics, which emphasizes treating individuals as ends in themselves rather than means to an end. Sandel's concern about respecting human dignity and adhering to moral laws reflects a Kantian perspective, making this the best fit among the options.

Answer: H
