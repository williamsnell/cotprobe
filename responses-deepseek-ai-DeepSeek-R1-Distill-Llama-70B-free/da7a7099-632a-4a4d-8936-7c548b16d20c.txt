Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about ethics and war. The question is asking about the view that moral considerations don't apply to war. Hmm, I need to figure out which option correctly labels that view.

Let me start by recalling what each of these terms generally means. 

Option A is moral absolutism. From what I remember, moral absolutism is the belief that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of context. Like, "thou shalt not kill" no matter what. So that's about unchanging moral rules, not about the absence of morality in war.

Option B is antiwar pacifism. Pacifism is the opposition to war and violence, so antiwar pacifists would argue against war on moral grounds. But that's about opposing war, not saying that morality doesn't apply during war.

Option C is just war theory. Just war theory actually deals with when it's morally acceptable to go to war and how to conduct it morally. So this is the oppositeâ€”it's about applying moral considerations to war, not dismissing them.

Option D is war pragmatism. Pragmatism in general is about practicality over principles. So war pragmatism might prioritize effectiveness and outcomes over moral concerns. But does that mean it ignores morality entirely, or just that it balances it with practical needs? I'm not entirely sure, but I'll keep this in mind.

Option E is moral nihilism. Nihilism in ethics is the belief that there are no objective moral values. So if someone is a moral nihilist, they might say that moral considerations don't apply anywhere, including war. But the question is specifically about war, so I'm not sure if this is the exact fit.

Option F is jus ad bellum. That's part of just war theory, specifically about the criteria for going to war. So again, this is about applying morals to war, not dismissing them.

Option G is moral relativism. That's the idea that moral judgments are relative to cultural or personal perspectives. So in war, actions could be justified based on one's own culture's morals. But this doesn't necessarily mean that moral considerations don't apply; it's more about varying standards.

Option H is utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is about maximizing overall happiness or utility. In war, a utilitarian might weigh the consequences of actions, but that's still applying moral reasoning, just a different type.

Option I is consequentialism. Similar to utilitarianism, this is the belief that the morality of an action depends on its outcomes. So again, it's about applying moral considerations based on results, not ignoring them.

Option J is war realism. I'm less familiar with this term. Realism in international relations often suggests that states act in their self-interest, and might disregard moral or legal constraints. So war realism could imply that during war, moral considerations are set aside because it's about power and survival.

Wait, going back to the question: the view that moral considerations don't apply to war. So which options fit that.

Moral absolutism (A) is about fixed morals, so it applies them strictly. Antiwar pacifism (B) applies morals to say war is wrong. Just war theory (C) and jus ad bellum (F) are about applying morals. Utilitarianism (H) and consequentialism (I) apply moral reasoning based on outcomes. Moral relativism (G) applies varying morals.

Moral nihilism (E) would say no objective morals exist at all, so in war, there's no right or wrong. War realism (J) suggests that in war, states don't consider morals because they're focused on winning and self-interest.

So the question is whether it's E or J.

Wait, the question is about the view that moral considerations don't apply to war. So if someone believes that in war, you can't apply moral considerations because it's every state for themselves, that's more of a realist view.

Alternatively, moral nihilism would say there's no such thing as morality in any context, including war.

But the question seems to be about the specific application to war, not a general rejection of morality everywhere.

So perhaps war realism (J) is the answer. Because realists might argue that during war, moral rules don't apply because it's about power and survival.

Alternatively, another angle: the term for the idea that in war, anything goes and there's no room for moral constraints is sometimes called "realism" in the context of war.

So I think the correct answer is J: war realism.
</think>

The question asks for the view that moral considerations do not apply to war. To determine the correct answer, each option is analyzed:

- **A: Moral absolutism** refers to fixed moral rules, so it applies morality strictly and does not fit the question.
- **B: Antiwar pacifism** opposes war on moral grounds, so it applies morality to argue against war.
- **C: Just war theory** and **F: Jus ad bellum** are about applying moral principles to war, not dismissing them.
- **D: War pragmatism** prioritizes practicality over morality but does not necessarily mean morality is entirely ignored.
- **E: Moral nihilism** rejects objective morality in all contexts, including war, but the question seems focused on war specifically.
- **G: Moral relativism** involves varying moral standards but still applies morality.
- **H: Utilitarianism** and **I: Consequentialism** apply moral reasoning based on outcomes.
- **J: War realism** suggests that in war, moral considerations are set aside due to the focus on power and survival.

The view that moral considerations do not apply to war aligns most closely with **war realism (J)**, which emphasizes self-interest and power over morality in the context of war.

Answer: J
