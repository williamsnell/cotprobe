Okay, I need to figure out which cat food brand claims that cats ask for it by name. Let me think about the different brands and their advertising slogans.

I remember that Meow Mix has a catchy jingle. The jingle goes something like "Meow meow meow meow, Meow Mix, please!" So that's probably the one where cats are said to ask for it by name because of the repetition of "meow." 

Looking at the options, Meow Mix is option G. So the answer should be G.
