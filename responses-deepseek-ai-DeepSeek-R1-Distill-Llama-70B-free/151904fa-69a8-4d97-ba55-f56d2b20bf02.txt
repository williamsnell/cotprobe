Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about arranging substances in order of their ability as reducing agents. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question lists the substances: Al, Co, Ni, Ag, H2, Na. I'm supposed to arrange them in decreasing order of their ability as reducing agents. The options are labeled A through J.

Wait, I remember that reducing agents are substances that get oxidized themselves. They donate electrons. So the better a reducing agent a substance is, the more easily it loses electrons. That should relate to the standard electrode potentials.

The standard electrode potentials table usually gives the reduction potentials. So higher (more positive) reduction potentials mean the substance is a better oxidizing agent. But since we're talking about reducing agents, which are the opposite, I think we need to look at the reverse. The lower the reduction potential, the stronger the reducing agent.

Right, because a substance with a lower reduction potential is more likely to be oxidized. For example, metals with low reduction potentials tend to lose electrons more readily.

So I should find the standard reduction potentials for each of these elements. Let's list them out.

I think the order of standard reduction potentials (from highest to lowest) is something like this: 

Metals like Na and Al have lower (or negative) reduction potentials because they are more reactive. The noble metals like Ag have higher potentials. Wait, but wait, for their reduction reactions.

Let me try to recall the specific values.

- Sodium (Na) has a very low reduction potential. I think it's around -2.71 V for Na+/Na.
- Aluminum (Al) is next; I think its reduction potential is about -1.66 V for Al^3+/Al.
- Then comes... maybe metals like zinc, but we don't have zinc here. Next, perhaps iron, but not in the list. Let's see, the others here are Co, Ni, Ag, and H2.

Wait, H2 is the hydrogen electrode, which has a potential of 0 V by definition.

For the others:
- Cobalt (Co) might be around -0.28 V. Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I think Co is about Co²+ + 2e^- → Co with E° around -0.28 V.
- Nickel (Ni) has a higher potential, maybe around -0.25 V? Or wait, no, I think Ni²+ + 2e^- → Ni is about -0.25 V.
Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me double-check in my mind. 

Wait, no, I think I might have the order wrong. Actually, for the metals:

- More active metals (stronger reducing agents) have lower reduction potentials.

So, from strongest to weakest reducing agents, the order would be the metals in the order of their increasing reduction potentials.

I think the correct order of their standard electrode potentials (from lowest to highest, meaning best to worst reducing agents) is:

Na < Al < (some metals) < H2 < ... but wait, the others are metals like Co, Ni, Ag.

Wait, let me get the correct order of their standard reduction potentials.

Looking up (mentally) the standard reduction potentials:

- Na+/Na: about -2.71 V
- Al^3+/Al: -1.66 V
- (Zn is -0.76, but not in the list)
- Fe is -0.44 V
- Co²+/Co: -0.28 V
- Ni²+/Ni: -0.25 V
- H+/H2: 0 V (by definition)
- Ag+/Ag: +0.80 V

So arranging these from lowest to highest reduction potential:

Na (-2.71) < Al (-1.66) < Co (-0.28) < Ni (-0.25) < H2 (0) < Ag (0.80)

Wait, wait, Co is -0.28 and Ni is -0.25, so Ni is higher than Co. So the order for their ability as reducing agents (strongest first) would be the reverse of their reduction potentials. Because a lower E° means a better reducing agent.

So the order from best to worst reducing agents is:

Na (E=-2.71) → best
Al (E=-1.66)
Co (E=-0.28)
Ni (E=-0.25)
H2 (E=0)
Ag (E=+0.80) → worst

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The standard reduction potential is for the reaction being reduced. So if a substance has a lower (more negative) E°, it's more likely to be oxidized. Because if E° is lower, it means the reverse reaction (oxidation) is more favorable.

So the order of reducing strength is:

Most willing to be oxidized → least.

So Na is the strongest reducing agent because it has the lowest E°. Then Al, then... Co, then Ni, then H2, then Ag.

Wait, but wait. Co has E°=-0.28 V, Ni is -0.25 V. So Ni has a higher E° (less negative) than Co. So which is a better reducing agent? The one with lower E°, so Co is a better reducing agent than Ni. Wait, no, because Co's E° is lower than Ni's. So Co is more willing to be oxidized than Ni? Wait, no, because if E° is lower, the substance is more likely to act as a reducing agent.

Let me clarify:

The reduction potential is for the reduction reaction. So if a species has a higher E°, it's a stronger oxidizing agent. For the reverse process (oxidation), the lower E° species are better reducing agents.

For example, consider two metals, A and B. If A has a lower E° than B, then A is more likely to be oxidized (act as a reducing agent) than B.

So in the list of E°s:

Na (-2.71) < Al (-1.66) < Co (-0.28) < Ni (-0.25) < H2 (0) < Ag (0.80)

So arranging in order of strongest to weakest reducing agents:

Na is first, then Al, then Co, then Ni, then H2, then Ag.

So the order is Na > Al > Co > Ni > H2 > Ag.

Now looking at the options provided, which option matches this order?

Looking at the options:

Option I: Na > Al > Co > Ni > H2 > Ag. That's exactly our order.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option I: Na > Al > Co > Ni > H2 > Ag.

Yes, that's correct. So the correct answer is option I.

To determine the order of substances as reducing agents, we use their standard reduction potentials. A substance with a lower (more negative) reduction potential is a stronger reducing agent because it is more easily oxidized. The standard reduction potentials for the given substances are approximately:

- **Na+/Na**: -2.71 V  
- **Al^3+/Al**: -1.66 V  
- **Co²+/Co**: -0.28 V  
- **Ni²+/Ni**: -0.25 V  
- **H+/H₂**: 0 V  
- **Ag+/Ag**: +0.80 V  

Arranging these substances in decreasing order of their ability as reducing agents (from strongest to weakest) corresponds to increasing order of their reduction potentials:

**Na > Al > Co > Ni > H₂ > Ag**

Now, comparing this order to the provided options:

- **Option I**: Na > Al > Co > Ni > H₂ > Ag  
This matches the derived order exactly.

Thus, the correct answer is **I**.
