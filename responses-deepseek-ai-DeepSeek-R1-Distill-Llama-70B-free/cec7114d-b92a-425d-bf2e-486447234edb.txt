Question:

In 2006, an investor purchased a 100-acre tract located in a rural county. Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan that created 90 one-acre residential building lots on this tract with the remaining 10-acre lot proposed for a public school building. In the investor's sales brochure promoting the subdivision, he stated that "in addition to the close proximity of the proposed school for subdivision residents, the county school district would not need to expend tax money to acquire this property for school construction. " In 2007, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. On January 15, 2009, the county school board voted to build a new school on the 10-acre tract. The investor's proposed designation of the 1 0-acre tract for construction of a school building would best be described as a (an)

Options:

A: equitable servitude.
B: easement for public use.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about real estate law, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about an investor who bought a 100-acre tract in 2006. He made a subdivision plan that turned 90 acres into one-acre residential lots and kept 10 acres for a public school. He mentioned in his sales brochure that the school wouldn't cost the county tax money because he's providing the land. Then in 2007, the subdivision plan was recorded. In 2009, the school board decided to build the school on that 10-acre tract.

The question is asking what the investor's designation of the 10 acres is best described as. The options are A through J, each a different legal term.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The investor is setting aside land for a school and informing potential buyers about this. By recording the subdivision plan, he's likely creating some kind of formal designation or restriction on that land.

I remember that when a developer creates a subdivision, they sometimes include restrictions or easements that apply to the lots. These could be in the form of covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs) or easements.

So, looking at the options:

A: Equitable servitude. Equitable servitudes are like restrictions on land use that are enforceable in equity. They often arise from a written agreement, like in a deed.

B: Easement for public use. An easement gives someone the right to use another's land. Public easements are usually for things like roads or utilities, and they can be created by prescription or dedication.

C: Invalid legal agreement. I don't see why it would be invalid. The investor recorded the plan, so it's likely a valid arrangement.

D: Implied easement. Implied easements arise without a written agreement, usually based on prior use. That doesn't seem to fit here because the investor explicitly set aside the land.

E: Adverse possession. That's when someone takes ownership by using the land without permission. Not relevant here.

F: Restrictive covenant. These are agreements that restrict how land can be used. They're often found in deeds and bind future owners.

G: Real estate lien. A lien is a claim on property for debt. Doesn't fit the scenario.

H: Unenforceable restriction. If it's recorded and part of the subdivision, it's likely enforceable.

I: Right of way easement. That's a type of easement for passage. Doesn't fit because it's for a school, not a right of way.

J: Zoning regulation. Zoning is a government-imposed regulation, not something a private developer does.

So, narrowing it down, the key is that the investor designated the land for a school and made this part of the subdivision plan. By recording it, he's probably creating an easement or a restrictive covenant.

Wait, but the investor is designating the 10 acres for the school. So is this an offer to the county to use the land? Or is it a dedication?

In real estate, when a developer dedicates land for public use, like a park or school, it's often done through an easement or by granting the public entity the right to use it. But the scenario says the school board later voted to build, so it's not automatically given; it's up to the school board to accept.

So perhaps the investor is offering the land via a restrictive covenant or an easement. But wait, an easement is a right to use the land, while a restrictive covenant is a restriction on how the land is used.

Wait, but the investor owns all the land initially. When he subdivides, he's creating lots and perhaps setting aside the 10 acres for the school. So, he might be reserving that land for the school, which would mean he's imposing a restriction on itâ€”so that it can only be used for the school.

Alternatively, maybe he's creating an easement for the public to use it as a school.

But in this case, the 10-acre lot is part of his tract. So by including it in the subdivision plan and stating it's for the school, he's likely creating a restriction that this part is for the school. So future owners (if he sells that lot) would be bound by that.

But wait, the investor's plan is to keep the 10 acres for the school. So perhaps he's dedicating it to public use, which would be an easement.

Alternatively, it's a restrictive covenant that the land must be used as a school.

Wait, restrictive covenants bind the land, so if the investor includes a covenant that the 10 acres must be used for a school, then that's a restrictive covenant. But usually, restrictive covenants are for how land is used, like no commercial buildings, etc.

An easement for public use (option B) would mean the public has a right to use the land for a specific purpose, like a school. So if the investor grants an easement to the county for the school, that's a public easement.

But the question says the investor "proposed" the designation in the sales brochure and recorded the subdivision plan. So it's more about how he's setting aside the land for that purpose, perhaps through some kind of dedication.

Wait, another thought: when a developer records a subdivision plan that includes areas dedicated for public use, like parks or schools, that's typically done through an easement or by granting the public entity an interest in the land. But sometimes, it's a dedication, which is an offer to the public. The public entity (like the school board) can then accept it.

In this case, the school board accepted it in 2009 by voting to build the school. So the investor's act of designating it in the recorded plan was an offer, which the school board accepted.

So what's the legal term for that offer? It's a dedication. But dedication isn't one of the options. Alternatively, the designation could be considered an easement for public use.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is "easement for public use." Option F is "restrictive covenant."

Alternatively, an equitable servitude (option A) is a type of restrictive covenant enforced in equity. So perhaps the investor created a restrictive covenant that the 10 acres must be used as a school.

But restrictive covenants typically run with the land and bind future owners. Here, the investor is designating the land for a school, which sounds more like an easement because it's a right granted to the public.

Wait, no, because the land is being set aside for the school, not granting a right of way. So an easement for public use would allow the public (or the school) to use it for that purpose.

Alternatively, if the investor is reserving the land for the school, perhaps it's a restrictive covenant that only allows it to be used as a school, but that doesn't quite fit because the school is a public use, not a restriction on the owner's use.

Hmm. Maybe it's best to think about what each term means.

Equitable servitude: a non-possessory right to use another's land, enforced in equity. Often arises from a covenant.

Easement for public use: a right granted to the public to use the land for a specific purpose.

Restrictive covenant: an agreement that restricts the use of land.

So in this case, the investor is setting aside land for a school. If he's granting the county the right to use it as a school, that's an easement. But if he's restricting the use of that land to a school, then it's a restrictive covenant.

Wait, but the investor owns the 10 acres. So if he's keeping it for the school, perhaps he's not selling it. Or maybe he's offering it to the county. So when the subdivision plan is recorded, perhaps he's creating an easement in favor of the school district.

Alternatively, in the sales brochure, he's marketing the proximity to the proposed school, implying that the school will be built there. So he's making a representation that the 10 acres are designated for that purpose.

But legally, what's the nature of that designation? If it's an offer to dedicate the land, then it's not yet accepted. Once the school board votes to build, they accept the offer, and it becomes an easement.

So the investor's action is an offer of dedication, which upon acceptance becomes a public easement. So the designation before acceptance would be the offer, and after, it's an easement.

But the question is about the investor's designation at the time of the brochure and recording the plan.

So perhaps the designation is an offer to create an easement, which would be an option for the school district to accept. But I'm not sure if that's one of the options.

Alternatively, the investor is creating a restrictive covenant that the 10 acres can only be used as a school. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: when a developer includes a school site in a subdivision plan and records it, it's often done through a dedication. Dedication is when the owner offers land for public use, and the public entity accepts it. Until accepted, it's just an offer, but once accepted, it becomes an easement or ownership transfer.

But in this case, the investor's action is the offer. So his designation is an offer to dedicate the land for public use, which is a type of easement for public use once accepted.

So the best description would be an easement for public use, option B.

Alternatively, if the subdivision plan includes a restriction that the 10 acres must be used as a school, that's a restrictive covenant, option F.

Wait, but restrictive covenants are typically private agreements, whereas an easement for public use is a right granted to the public. So in this case, since it's for a public school, it's more about granting a right to the public entity (the school district) to use the land as a school. So that sounds more like an easement.

So I'm leaning towards option B: easement for public use.

Wait, but another thought: when a developer records a subdivision plan that includes areas for public use, sometimes it's considered a dedication, which is a form of conveyance. But the question is about the investor's proposal before the school board accepted it. So perhaps the designation is an offer to create an easement, which would be an option for the school board to accept.

But the options don't include "offer to dedicate." So among the choices, the closest is either B or F.

I think the correct answer is B: easement for public use. Because the investor is designating the land for the school, which is a public use, and once the school board accepts, it becomes an easement.

Alternatively, if it's a restrictive covenant, it's F. But that would mean the land is restricted to school use. So if the investor owns the land and wants to ensure it's only used as a school, he could impose a restrictive covenant. But that's more about restricting use rather than granting a right.

Wait, but in the scenario, the investor is promoting that the school will be there, implying that the land is set aside for that purpose. So the designation is more about dedicating it to public use, which is an easement.

So I think the answer is B.

The investor purchased a 100-acre tract and created a subdivision plan designating 90 acres for residential lots and 10 acres for a public school. The plan was recorded in 2007, and in 2009, the school board voted to build the school on the 10-acre tract. The question asks for the best legal description of the investor's designation of the 10-acre tract.

Key analysis of the options:

- **A: Equitable servitude** refers to a non-possessory right to use land, enforced in equity. This does not fit because the scenario involves designating land for public use, not a private right.

- **B: Easement for public use** involves granting the public a right to use land for a specific purpose. The investor's designation of the 10-acre tract for a school aligns with this, as it is intended for public use.

- **C: Invalid legal agreement** is incorrect because the investor recorded the subdivision plan, making it a valid legal arrangement.

- **D: Implied easement** arises without a written agreement, based on prior use. This does not apply, as the investor explicitly designated the land for a school.

- **E: Adverse possession** involves taking ownership through unauthorized use, which is irrelevant here.

- **F: Restrictive covenant** restricts land use, often through private agreements. While the investor restricted the 10-acre tract for school use, this is more about granting a public right than a private restriction.

- **G: Real estate lien** involves a claim on property for debt, which is unrelated.

- **H: Unenforceable restriction** is incorrect because the recorded plan likely creates an enforceable restriction.

- **I: Right of way easement** involves passage rights, which do not apply to a school designation.

- **J: Zoning regulation** is a government-imposed rule, not a private action by the investor.

The investor's designation of the 10-acre tract for a school is best described as an **easement for public use**, as it grants the public (via the school district) the right to use the land for a specific purpose. This aligns with the investor's recorded subdivision plan and the school board's subsequent acceptance.
