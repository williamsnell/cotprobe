Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

The problem is about a steel rod that's being heated at one end, and the other end is in ice. I'm supposed to calculate how much ice melts in a given time. The question provides some data, and I need to choose the correct mass from the options.

Alright, let's break down the information:

- Length of the rod, L = 20 cm.
- Cross-sectional area, A = 3 cm².
- Temperature at the heated end, T1 = 300 K.
- The other end is in ice. I remember that ice melts at 0°C, which is 273 K, but wait, in the problem, the units are in Kelvin because T1 is 300 K. So the ice is at 273 K, I think.
- Time, Δt = 10 minutes. Hmm, I'll probably need to convert that into seconds because the thermal conductivity is given per second.
- Thermal conductivity of steel, k = 0.16 cal/(deg·s·cm). Wait, I should note the units here. It's per degree, per second, per centimeter.

The goal is to find the mass of ice that melts. So I'm thinking about heat transfer and how that relates to melting ice.

I remember that the heat conducted through a material is given by Fourier's Law. The formula is Q = (k * A * ΔT * t) / L, where Q is the heat transferred, k is thermal conductivity, A is cross-sectional area, ΔT is the temperature difference, t is time, and L is the length of the material.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, right, Fourier's Law is Q = (k * A * (T_hot - T_cold) * t) / L. That makes sense. Since one end is at 300 K and the other is at 0°C (273 K), the ΔT is 300 - 273 = 27 K. Or wait, 300 K minus 273 K is 27 degrees, right?

So plugging the numbers in:

k = 0.16 cal/(s·cm·K) [since it's per degree, which I'm treating as Kelvin here]
A = 3 cm²
ΔT = 27 K
t = 10 minutes. Oh, I need to convert that into seconds because the units for k are per second. So 10 minutes is 600 seconds.

L is 20 cm.

So putting it all together:

Q = (0.16 cal/(s·cm·K)) * 3 cm² * 27 K * 600 s / 20 cm

Let me calculate this step by step.

First, the units: cal/(s·cm·K) * cm² * K * s / cm. Let's see:

The cm in the denominator (from k) and cm² in A gives cm in the numerator (because 3 cm² / 20 cm is 3/20 cm). Wait, let me double-check that:

k has units cal/(s·cm·K), A is cm², ΔT is K, t is s, and L is cm.

So the denominator is s, cm, K, and the numerators are cm², K, s.

Let me write the units:

(k * A * ΔT * t) / L → ( (cal/(s·cm·K)) * cm² * K * s ) / cm

Breaking it down:

- (cal/(s·cm·K)) * cm² → cal/(s·cm·K) * cm² = cal * cm/(s·K)
- Then multiply by K: cal * cm/(s·K) * K → cal * cm/s
- Multiply by s: cal * cm/s * s → cal * cm
- Then divide by L (cm): cal * cm / cm → cal.

So the units work out to calories, which is good because Q is in calories.

Now, crunching the numbers:

0.16 * 3 = 0.48.

0.48 * 27 = let's see, 0.4 *27=10.8, 0.08*27=2.16 → total 12.96.

12.96 * 600 = 7776.

Divide by 20 → 7776 / 20 = 388.8 cal.

So Q is 388.8 calories.

Wait, but wait, calories can be a bit confusing. Because 1 calorie is the amount of heat needed to raise 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius. But when dealing with phase changes, like melting ice, we use the latent heat of fusion, which is 80 cal/gm for water. Or wait, is it 80 or 79.6? I think for this problem, it's probably 80 cal/gm.

So the heat Q is used to melt ice. The formula is Q = m * L_f, where L_f is the latent heat of fusion.

So m = Q / L_f.

Plugging in the numbers, Q is 388.8 cal, L_f is 80 cal/g.

m = 388.8 / 80 = let's compute that.

388.8 /80 = ?

Well, 80 *4 = 320, 388.8-320=68.8. 68.8/80=0.86. So 4.86 grams.

Wait, wait, that's because 80 *4.86 = 388.8.

So the mass is 4.86 grams.

Looking at the options, option H is 4.86 gr. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me double-check all my steps because it's easy to make a mistake.

Wait, wait a second. I think I might have miscalculated the time. Oh no, wait, the problem says 10 minutes, which is 600 seconds. I used that, correct. So that's right.

Another point: the thermal conductivity given was in cal/(deg·s·cm), but since the temperature difference is in Kelvin, which is the same size as degrees Celsius in terms of intervals, so that's correct. So ΔT is 27 K, which is 27 degrees Celsius difference, so we can use it directly.

Yes, the formula is correct. So yeah, m=4.86 grams, which is option H.

To calculate the mass of ice that melts, we use Fourier's Law of heat conduction:

\[
Q = \frac{k \cdot A \cdot \Delta T \cdot t}{L}
\]

Where:
- \( k = 0.16 \, \text{cal/(s·cm·K)} \) (thermal conductivity of steel),
- \( A = 3 \, \text{cm}^2 \) (cross-sectional area of the rod),
- \( \Delta T = T_1 - T_2 = 300 \, \text{K} - 273 \, \text{K} = 27 \, \text{K} \) (temperature difference),
- \( t = 10 \, \text{minutes} = 600 \, \text{seconds} \) (time),
- \( L = 20 \, \text{cm} \) (length of the rod).

Substituting the values:

\[
Q = \frac{0.16 \cdot 3 \cdot 27 \cdot 600}{20}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
0.16 \cdot 3 = 0.48, \quad 0.48 \cdot 27 = 12.96, \quad 12.96 \cdot 600 = 7776
\]

Now divide by 20:

\[
Q = \frac{7776}{20} = 388.8 \, \text{cal}
\]

The heat \( Q \) is used to melt ice. The relationship between heat and mass for phase changes is:

\[
Q = m \cdot L_f
\]

Where \( L_f = 80 \, \text{cal/g} \) (latent heat of fusion for ice). Solving for \( m \):

\[
m = \frac{Q}{L_f} = \frac{388.8}{80} = 4.86 \, \text{g}
\]

Thus, the mass of ice that melts is \( 4.86 \, \text{g} \), which corresponds to option **H**.
