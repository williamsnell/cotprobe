Okay, so I have this finance question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says: When a security has a maturity value of $100,000 and the coupon rate is 5%, what are you willing to pay for it when it is due next year and the yield is 9%?

Hmm, okay. I remember that this is about bond valuation. The maturity value is the face value, which is what the bond is worth at maturity. The coupon rate is the interest paid each year, and the yield is the return an investor expects.

So, I think this is a one-year bond since it's due next year. Wait, no, the time until maturity is one year because it's due next year. So the security is a one-year bond? Or maybe it's a longer-term bond but being sold before maturity. Wait, the question says it's due next year, so the time to maturity is one year.

The face value is $100,000, coupon rate is 5% per year. So annual coupon payment would be 5% of 100,000, which is $5,000. But since it's maturing in a year, the bondholder will get the coupon plus the face value at that time.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again. If the bond is due next year, then it's about to mature. So when you buy it now, you'll get the coupon payment once (since it's annual) and the face value when it matures.

Wait, but usually, bonds pay coupons semi-annually, but the question says the coupon rate is 5%, so I guess it's annual. So each year, the bond pays $5,000.

But since the time to maturity is one year, you'll receive the $5,000 coupon in one year, and the $100,000 face value in one year.

Wait, no. Wait, let's clarify. If the bond is due next year, that means it will mature in one year from now. So when you buy it today, you'll hold it until it matures in a year, and during that time, you'll receive one coupon payment and the face value.

So the cash flows are: in one year, you get $5,000 (the coupon) plus $100,000 (the face value), totaling $105,000 in one year.

But wait, wait. No, that can't be right. Because if the bond is bought today and is due next year, then the coupon payment would have been made annually. So the last coupon payment is at maturity. So the buyer at this point would receive the coupon and the face value in one year.

So the cash flows are as follows: at time 0, you pay P (the price), and at time 1, you receive $5,000 (coupon) plus $100,000 (face value) = $105,000.

So the present value of these cash flows, discounted at the yield rate of 9%, will give the price P.

So the formula should be P = (C + F) / (1 + r)^t

Where C is the coupon payment, F is the face value, r is the yield, and t is the time in years.

Plugging in the numbers: C = $5,000, F = $100,000, r = 9% or 0.09, t = 1 year.

So P = (5,000 + 100,000) / (1 + 0.09)^1.

Calculating the denominator: 1.09.

So numerator is 105,000.

105,000 divided by 1.09.

Wait, let's compute that. 105,000 / 1.09.

Hmm, 1.09 times 96,330 is approximately 105,000 because 96,330 * 1.09:

96,330 * 1 = 96,330

96,330 * 0.09 = 8,669.7

Adding them gives 96,330 + 8,669.7 = 104,999.7, which is about 105,000. So 96,330.28 would be the exact value.

Looking at the options, option B is $96,330.28.

Wait, but wait another thought. Are there any other possible interpretations? For example, if the bond had more time, but the question says it's due next year, so t=1.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupon is paid annually, but the yield is calculated semi-annually. Wait, the question doesn't specify that, so I think we can assume annual compounding.

So the calculation should be correct.

So the correct answer is option B: $96,330.28.

To determine the price you are willing to pay for the security, we need to calculate the present value of its future cash flows, discounted at the given yield rate. The security has a maturity value (face value) of $100,000, a coupon rate of 5%, and a time to maturity of 1 year. The yield rate is 9%.

1. **Cash Flows**:  
   - At maturity (in 1 year), the bondholder will receive two payments:  
     - The coupon payment: \( 5\% \times 100,000 = 5,000 \).  
     - The face value: \( 100,000 \).  
     - Total cash flow at maturity: \( 5,000 + 100,000 = 105,000 \).

2. **Discounting**:  
   The present value (\( P \)) of the future cash flows is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   P = \frac{C + F}{(1 + r)^t}
   \]  
   Where:  
   - \( C = 5,000 \) (coupon payment),  
   - \( F = 100,000 \) (face value),  
   - \( r = 9\% = 0.09 \) (yield rate),  
   - \( t = 1 \) (time in years).  

   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   P = \frac{5,000 + 100,000}{(1 + 0.09)^1} = \frac{105,000}{1.09}
   \]  

3. **Calculation**:  
   \[
   P = \frac{105,000}{1.09} \approx 96,330.28
   \]  

Thus, the price you are willing to pay for the security is approximately **$96,330.28**.

**Correct Option**:  
B: $96,330.28
