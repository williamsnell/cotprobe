Okay, so I've got this problem about Mr. Wingate's car insurance and his refund. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.

So, the insurance costs $173.50 per year. That means the total policy is for 12 months. He had the policy for 115 days before it was cancelled. Now, I need to find out how much refund he gets depending on whether he cancels or the insurance company does.

Wait, I remember something about pro-rata and short-rate cancellations. Oh right! If the policyholder cancels, they get a pro-rata refund, which means a proportional refund based on the time left. But if the company cancels, they might use a short-rate method, which gives a smaller refund because it includes some fees.

So, first, I think I need to calculate the daily rate of the insurance. The annual cost is $173.50. There are 365 days in a year, so each day's cost would be 173.50 divided by 365. Let me calculate that.

173.50 / 365 equals... let's see. 365 goes into 173.50 about 0.475 times, so approximately $0.475 per day. Wait, let me do the exact calculation. 173.50 ÷ 365. Let's see, 365 × 0.475 is 173.625, which is a bit more than 173.50. So maybe it's around 0.47534... So approximately $0.475 per day.

Now, for pro-rata refund when he cancels: He's used 115 days out of 365. So the amount he's used is 115 days. So the refund would be the total cost minus the cost for those 115 days. Alternatively, the refund is (365-115)/365 times the total. Or wait, maybe it's the unused days divided by total days, multiplied by the premium. So unused days are 365 - 115 = 250 days. So 250/365 * 173.50.

Let me calculate that. 250 divided by 365 is about 0.6849. Multiply that by 173.50: 173.50 * 0.6849. Let's compute that.

173.50 * 0.6 is 104.10, 173.50 * 0.08 is about 13.88, and 173.50 * 0.0049 is around 0.85. Adding those together: 104.10 +13.88 is 117.98, plus 0.85 gives about 118.83. Wait, but wait, I think I might have miscalculated because 0.6849 is more precise.

Alternatively, maybe a better way is to compute 173.50 * (250/365). Let me do exact division. 250 divided by 365 is approximately 0.6849315. Multiply 173.50 by 0.6849315.

Hmm, 173.50 × 0.6849315. Let me compute this step by step. 

First, 173.50 × 0.6 = 104.10.

Then, 173.50 × 0.08 = 13.88.

Next, 173.50 × 0.0049315 ≈ 173.50 × 0.005 = 0.8675, but subtract a little. So maybe around 0.855.

Adding 104.10 +13.88 = 117.98, plus 0.855 gives approximately 118.83. So the pro-rata refund would be about $118.84, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, the total cost is $173.50. So if he's used 115 days, the amount he's paid for is 115 days. So the refund is the amount for the remaining days, which is 250 days. So 250/365 of the total.

Wait, so that's correct, the pro-rata refund is (250/365)*173.50 ≈ $118.84.

But when the insurance company cancels, they use a short-rate method. What's that? Oh right, the short-rate cancellation gives a smaller refund than pro-rata because it's based on a higher minimum daily rate. Or wait, maybe it's that they calculate the refund by subtracting a certain percentage as a service fee. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact calculation.

Wait, maybe the short-rate method is that the refund is the pro-rata amount minus some flat fee, or maybe it's calculated differently. Alternatively, perhaps it's calculated as 10% of the premium for the first 30 days, and then pro-rata after that, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the short-rate method is that the company keeps a certain percentage for each month. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think in short-rate cancellation, the refund is calculated as the pro-rata amount minus a fixed fee, but maybe that's not right. Alternatively, it's a different method altogether.

Wait, perhaps the short-rate method is that the company calculates the refund as the premium multiplied by the ratio of days remaining, but then reduces that by a certain percentage or a flat fee. Alternatively, maybe it's a different calculation method, like using a higher daily rate for the first part.

Wait, maybe the short-rate method is that the company charges a higher rate for the initial period. For example, sometimes the first 30 days are charged at a higher rate, and then the remaining days at a lower rate. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's calculated as a flat 10% of the premium for the first 30 days, then pro-rata after that.

Wait, maybe I should look for a formula. Hmm, I'm trying to recall. Oh, I think the short-rate refund is calculated as the pro-rata amount minus a fee. Let me think. The formula for short-rate refund is: Refund = (Unearned premium) - (Short-rate fee). The short-rate fee is usually 10% of the unearned premium, but I might be mixing up the terms.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. The unearned premium is the amount that the company hasn't yet earned, so that's the pro-rata part. Then, the company subtracts a fee for handling the cancellation, which is a percentage of the unearned premium.

So, if the unearned premium is $118.84, then the short-rate fee might be, say, 10% of that, which would be about $11.88. So the refund would be $118.84 minus $11.88, which equals about $106.96. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the short-rate method uses a different approach. Alternatively, maybe it's calculated as the unearned premium minus a flat fee, say $25, but that would make the refund $118.84 - $25 = $93.84, which still doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the short-rate method is calculated by determining the earned premium as the greater of a minimum earned premium plus a pro-rata amount. Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the short-rate method is that the earned premium is calculated as the initial premium multiplied by the time in force, but with a minimum of, say, 10% of the annual premium. So, for example, the earned premium would be the maximum between 10% of the annual premium and the pro-rata earned amount.

Wait, let's see. The annual premium is $173.50. 10% of that is $17.35. The pro-rata earned amount is (115/365)*173.50. Let me calculate that.

115 days is a third of a year, roughly. 115/365 is exactly 1/3.175, so about 0.315. So 0.315 * 173.50 ≈ let's see, 173.50 * 0.3 is 52.05, 173.50 *0.015 is about 2.60, so total approximately 54.65.

So the pro-rata earned amount is about $54.65. So the earned premium is the maximum between $17.35 (10%) and $54.65, which is $54.65. So the unearned premium is $173.50 - $54.65 = $118.85. But wait, that's the same as the pro-rata unearned. So that doesn't explain the difference.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me try another approach. Maybe when the company cancels, they calculate the refund using a short-rate method, which is less favorable to the policyholder. So perhaps it's a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the short-rate method is that the company charges a higher rate for the initial period, like a minimum of one month's premium, and then pro-rata for the remaining. So, for example, if the policy is canceled after 115 days, which is roughly 3 and 2/3 months. So perhaps the company charges for 3 full months and pro-rata for the extra days beyond that.

Wait, let's see. 115 days is approximately 3 months and 25 days. So maybe the company charges for 3 full months plus the 25 days at the daily rate.

Wait, the annual rate is $173.50. So monthly would be 173.50 /12 ≈ $14.458 per month. So 3 months would be 3 * 14.458 ≈ $43.375. Then, 25 days at the daily rate of 173.50/365 ≈ $0.475 per day. So 25 * 0.475 ≈ $11.875. So total earned premium would be 43.375 + 11.875 = $55.25. So the unearned premium is 173.50 - 55.25 = $118.25. So refund would be $118.25, but that's similar to the pro-rata method, which doesn't explain the difference.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the answer options again.

The options are:

A: $173.50 and $173.50

B: $42 and $115

C: $72.87 and $54.66

D: $100.63 and $118.84

Wait, so the question is asking for two scenarios: (a) he cancels, (b) company cancels. So we need two amounts.

From earlier, I thought that when he cancels, the refund is pro-rata, which was around $118.84. When the company cancels, the refund is less, perhaps using a different method.

Looking at the options, option D has $100.63 and $118.84. So perhaps when he cancels, he gets $118.84, and when the company cancels, he gets less, like $100.63.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe I got the methods reversed. No, no, when he cancels, it's pro-rata, which is a higher refund. When the company cancels, they use short-rate, which gives less. So (a) would be higher, (b) lower.

Wait, in option D, (a) is $100.63 and (b) is $118.84. That would mean that when he cancels, he gets less, which contradicts. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I got the methods wrong. Maybe when the policyholder cancels, they get the pro-rata refund of $118.84, but when the company cancels, they give a short-rate, which is a smaller amount. So looking for an option where (a) is about 118, and (b) is lower. Let's check the options.

Option D: (a) $100.63, (b) $118.84. Wait, that's the opposite. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute both scenarios again.

Wait, when the policyholder cancels, he gets a pro-rata refund, which is (unused days / total days) * premium.

Unused days = 365 - 115 = 250.

So 250/365 * 173.50 = (250 * 173.50) / 365.

Calculating 250 * 173.50 = 250 * 170 = 42,500 plus 250 * 3.50 = 875, so total 43,375.

Divide by 365: 43,375 /365.

Let me compute 365 × 118 = 365*(100+18) = 36,500 + 6,570= 43,070.

So 43,375 - 43,070 = 305 remaining.

305 /365 = 0.8356... So total is 118.8356, approximately $118.84.

So (a) when he cancels, the refund is $118.84.

For (b), when the company cancels, they use short-rate, which gives a smaller refund. So perhaps they calculate it as (used days / 365) * premium, but with a minimum charge.

Wait, perhaps the short-rate is calculated as the earned premium is the greater of (a) the pro-rata earned amount, or (b) a minimum percentage of the premium, like 10% for the first month.

Wait, 10% of 173.50 is 17.35. The pro-rata earned amount is (115/365)*173.50 ≈ 54.66. So the earned premium would be 54.66, which is higher than 17.35, so the unearned is 173.50 -54.66= 118.84, which is the same as before. Hmm, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the short-rate method charges a higher daily rate for the initial period. For example, the first month is charged at a higher rate, say, 1/12 per month, but with a minimum. Let me try that.

Wait, another approach: short-rate is calculated by subtracting a fixed fee from the unearned premium. So the refund is unearned premium minus a fee, perhaps 10% of the unearned premium.

So unearned is $118.84, 10% of that is $11.88. So refund would be 118.84 -11.88 ≈ $106.96.

But that's not matching any of the options.

Looking back at the options:

Option D is (a) $100.63, (b) $118.84.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the scenarios. Maybe when the policyholder cancels, it's a short-rate, and when the company cancels, it's pro-rata. No, that doesn't make sense because when the policyholder cancels, they usually get a better refund.

Wait, perhaps I should check the refund when the company cancels. So perhaps the company calculates the earned premium as the greater of (a) the pro-rata amount, or (b) a minimum of 10% of the premium. So the earned premium would be 54.66, so the refund is 173.50 -54.66 = 118.84.

Wait, but that's the same as before. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the company uses a different method, like considering a minimum earned premium of $50, so the earned premium is max(54.66, 50) =54.66, so refund is 118.84. But that doesn't change anything.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the short-rate method. Let me try to find another approach.

Wait, perhaps the short-rate method is calculated as follows: The earned premium is the pro-rata amount plus a flat fee. So the refund would be the unearned premium minus that fee. Or perhaps the earned premium is the pro-rata amount plus a fee, so the refund is less.

Wait, perhaps the short-rate method is calculated by taking the pro-rata earned amount and adding a certain percentage as a fee, which reduces the refund.

Alternatively, perhaps the short-rate method charges the policyholder for the time the policy was in force, but at a higher daily rate than the pro-rata rate. For example, the first 30 days are charged at a higher rate, say, 1/360 per day, and the rest at the regular rate.

Wait, let me try that. So for 115 days, perhaps the first 30 days are charged at 173.50/360 ≈ $0.4819 per day, and the remaining 85 days at 173.50/365 ≈ $0.4753 per day.

So the earned premium would be (30 * 0.4819) + (85 * 0.4753).

Calculating:

30 * 0.4819 ≈ 14.457

85 * 0.4753 ≈ let's compute 80 *0.4753=38.224, and 5*0.4753=2.3765 → total 40.6005.

So total earned premium ≈ 14.457 +40.6005 ≈55.0575.

So the unearned premium is 173.50 -55.0575 ≈118.4425, so refund is ≈118.44, which is similar to the pro-rata. That doesn't make sense because it's almost the same.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The options suggest that when he cancels, he gets a lower refund, but when the company cancels, he gets a higher one. But that contradicts my understanding.

Wait, perhaps I had the methods reversed. Maybe when the policyholder cancels, the refund is calculated using short-rate, giving a smaller amount, and when the company cancels, it's pro-rata, giving a larger amount. But that doesn't align with what I thought earlier.

Wait, no, that can't be. When the policyholder cancels, they usually get a better refund, pro-rata, which is a higher amount. The company, when they cancel, would give a smaller refund, using short-rate.

But looking at the options, option D has (a) $100.63 and (b) $118.84. So scenario (a) is lower, (b) is higher. So that would suggest that when the policyholder cancels, he gets less, which contradicts.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the pro-rata. Let me recalculate.

Wait, when he cancels, the refund is (unused days / total days) * premium.

Unused days =365-115=250.

250/365= approx 0.6849.

0.6849*173.50= let's compute.

0.6*173.50=104.10

0.08*173.50=13.88

0.0049*173.50≈0.851

So total 104.10+13.88=117.98+0.851≈118.83.

So that's correct. So when he canc
