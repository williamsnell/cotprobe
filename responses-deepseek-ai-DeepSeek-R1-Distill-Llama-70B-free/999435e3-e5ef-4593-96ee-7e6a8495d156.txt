Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about how culture is a source of social influence. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about identifying the correct explanation of how culture influences society. Culture, as I remember from previous classes, refers to the shared beliefs, values, customs, behaviors, and artifacts that characterize a group or society. Social influence, on the other hand, involves how people are affected by the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of others.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one to see which makes the most sense.

Option A: Culture dictates individual preferences. Hmm, I think culture does influence what people like or prefer, but is that the primary way it's a source of social influence? Maybe, but let me check the others.

Option B: Culture determines genetic makeup. No, that doesn't sound right. Genetics are biological, and culture is learned behavior, so B is probably incorrect.

Option C: Culture determines physical health and wellbeing. While culture can affect health practices, I'm not sure if it's the primary factor or the main source of social influence. Plus, the question is about social influence, not health.

Option D: Culture shapes language and thus controls communication. Language is a big part of culture, and it does influence how people communicate. But does it control all forms of communication? That seems a bit broad. I'm not sure if this is the best answer.

Option E: Culture controls economic status. I don't think culture is the sole determinant of economic status. Economic status is influenced by many factors, including culture, but it's not the only one. So E might not be correct.

Option F: Culture solely determines career path and success. That seems too absolute. While culture can influence career choices and opportunities, it's not the only factor. So F is probably wrong.

Option G: Culture provides ready-made answers, dictates routines, and helps people cope. This sounds familiar. I think culture does provide a framework for solving problems and handling life situations. It gives people norms, values, and practices that shape their interactions and daily lives. This seems like a comprehensive answer.

Option H: Culture alters the physical environment. While culture can influence how people interact with their environment, I'm not sure if altering the environment is the primary way it influences socially. It's more about the behaviors and beliefs.

Option I: Culture mandates political structure. Culture does influence politics, but the political structure is also shaped by other factors like history and economics. So I is probably not the best choice.

Option J: Culture is inherited biologically. No, culture is learned, not inherited through biology. So J is incorrect.

After reviewing all the options, G seems to capture the essence of how culture influences society. It provides solutions to life's problems, sets routines, and offers ways for groups to function together. This aligns with what I remember about culture shaping social norms and behaviors.
