Question:

The marketing research firm of Burrows, Heller and Larimer wants to estimate the proportions of men and women who are familiar with a shoe polish. In a sample (random) of 100 men and 200 women it is found that 20 men and 60 women had used this particular shoe polish. Compute a 95% confidence interval for the difference in pro portions between men and women familiar with the product. Use this to test the hypothesis that the proportions are equal.

Options:

A: The confidence interval includes zero, indicating no difference in proportions
B: The proportions are equal
C: The proportions are not equal
D: The confidence interval does not include zero, indicating a significant difference in proportions
E: The proportion of women is higher
F: The confidence interval is too wide to determine a significant difference
G: The proportion of men is higher
H: No conclusion can be drawn without further data
I: The proportion of men is significantly lower
J: The proportion of women is significantly lower

Okay, so I have to figure out this statistics problem about confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The marketing research firm is looking at the proportions of men and women who are familiar with a shoe polish. They took a random sample: 100 men and 200 women. The results were that 20 men and 60 women had used the polish. They want a 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions. Then, they want to test if the proportions are equal.

Wait, I remember that when comparing two proportions, the confidence interval for the difference (p1 - p2) can tell us if there's a significant difference. If the interval doesn't include zero, then we can reject the null hypothesis that p1 = p2. But if zero is inside the interval, we can't reject the null, meaning no significant difference.

So first, let's compute the sample proportions. For men, 20 out of 100 used the polish, so p1 = 20/100 = 0.2. For women, 60 out of 200 used it, so p2 = 60/200 = 0.3. The difference is p1 - p2 = 0.2 - 0.3 = -0.1.

But we need the confidence interval for this difference. The formula for the confidence interval is (p1 - p2) ± Z*(sqrt(p1*(1-p1)/n1 + p2*(1-p2)/n2)).

The Z value for 95% confidence is 1.96. Calculating the standard error (SE): sqrt[(0.2*0.8)/100 + (0.3*0.7)/200]. Let me compute each part.

First part: (0.2 * 0.8) = 0.16. Divide by 100: 0.0016. Second part: (0.3*0.7)=0.21. Divide by 200: 0.00105. Adding them gives 0.0016 + 0.00105 = 0.00265. Take square root: sqrt(0.00265) ≈ 0.0515.

So SE is approximately 0.0515. Multiply by Z: 1.96 * 0.0515 ≈ 0.101.

So the confidence interval is -0.1 ± 0.101. That gives a lower bound of about -0.201 and upper bound of 0.001.

Wait, because 0.101 is the margin of error. So the interval is from (-0.1 -0.101)= -0.201 to (-0.1 +0.101)=0.001.

So the interval ranges from about -0.201 to +0.001. So it includes zero? Because the upper limit is just barely above zero, but the lower limit is negative.

Wait, zero is within the interval because the upper limit is positive (0.001) and the lower is negative (-0.201). So zero is inside the interval.

If the confidence interval includes zero, that means that the difference could be zero, so we don't have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the proportions are equal. So the confidence interval includes zero, meaning no significant difference.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake.

p1=0.2, p2=0.3.

SE = sqrt[(0.2*0.8)/100 + (0.3*0.7)/200]

Calculating each term:

0.2 * 0.8 =0.16. 0.16 /100=0.0016.

0.3*0.7=0.21. 0.21/200=0.00105.

Sum is 0.0016 + 0.00105 = 0.00265. sqrt(0.00265) is approximately 0.0515.

Z=1.96, so 1.96 *0.0515≈0.101.

So the interval is -0.1 ±0.101 → (-0.201, 0.001). So yes, zero is inside.

Therefore, the confidence interval includes zero, which suggests that the difference between the two proportions isn't statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. So the correct answer would be A, which says the interval includes zero, meaning no difference in proportions.

But wait, looking back at the options, A says the interval includes zero, so no difference. Option E says the proportion of women is higher. But since the interval includes zero, we can't conclude that. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but another thought: the difference is p1 - p2 = -0.1, and the interval is from -0.201 to 0.001. So the entire interval is from negative to just barely positive.

So zero is within the interval, meaning that the data is consistent with the possibility that p1 - p2 is zero. So the null hypothesis (proportions are equal) can't be rejected.

So the correct answer is A: The confidence interval includes zero, indicating no difference in proportions.

To determine whether there is a significant difference in the proportions of men and women familiar with the shoe polish, we calculate a 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions. The sample proportions are:

- For men: \( p_1 = \frac{20}{100} = 0.2 \)
- For women: \( p_2 = \frac{60}{200} = 0.3 \)

The difference in proportions is \( p_1 - p_2 = 0.2 - 0.3 = -0.1 \).

The formula for the confidence interval is:

\[
(p_1 - p_2) \pm Z \cdot \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}
\]

Where:
- \( Z = 1.96 \) (for a 95% confidence level),
- \( \frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.8}{100} = 0.0016 \),
- \( \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2} = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.7}{200} = 0.00105 \).

The standard error (SE) is:

\[
SE = \sqrt{0.0016 + 0.00105} = \sqrt{0.00265} \approx 0.0515
\]

The margin of error is:

\[
Z \cdot SE = 1.96 \cdot 0.0515 \approx 0.101
\]

The 95% confidence interval is:

\[
-0.1 \pm 0.101 \implies (-0.201, 0.001)
\]

Since the confidence interval includes zero, it indicates that the difference in proportions could be zero. Therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the proportions are equal. This means there is no statistically significant difference in the proportions of men and women familiar with the product at the 95% confidence level.

The correct answer is:

**A: The confidence interval includes zero, indicating no difference in proportions.**
