Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about sulfuric acid solution, and I need to find the weight of H2SO4 in 1000 ml, the molarity, and the normality. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that the solution is 90% H2SO4 by weight. The density is given as 1.8 g/ml. I think density is mass per volume, so I can use that to find the total mass of the solution.

Wait, the volume is 1000 ml, right? So the total mass of the solution is density multiplied by volume. Let me calculate that. Density is 1.8 g/ml, so 1.8 * 1000 ml = 1800 grams of solution. Oh, wait, that's the total mass of the solution.

But the solution is 90% sulfuric acid by weight. So the mass of H2SO4 is 90% of 1800 grams. Let me do that: 0.9 * 1800 = 1620 grams. Okay, so that's the weight part.

Now, onto molarity. Molarity is moles of solute per liter of solution. I need the moles of H2SO4. The molar mass of H2SO4: H is about 1 g/mol, so 2*1 = 2. S is 32, O is 16 each, and there are four O's. So 32 + 4*16 = 32 +64=96. Adding the H's: 2 +96=98 g/mol.

So moles of H2SO4 is mass divided by molar mass: 1620 g / 98 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1620 divided by 98. Well, 98 times 16 is 1568 (because 100*16=1600, minus 2*16=32, so 1600-32=1568). So 1620-1568=52. So that's 16 and 52/98. 52/98 is about 0.5306. So approximately 16.5306 moles. Wait, no, wait: 1620 /98 is 16.5306? Let me check. 98*16 =1568, so 1620-1568=52 left. 52/98 = 0.5306. So 16.5306 moles.

Wait, but wait, 16.53 moles in 1 liter? Because the solution is 1000 ml, which is 1 liter. So molarity is 16.53 M? But looking at the options, I don't see that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, the solution's volume is 1000 ml, which is 1 liter. So if I have 1620 grams of H2SO4, then moles = 1620 /98. Let me compute that more accurately.

1620 ÷98. Let me do this step by step. 98 ×16= 1568. 1620-1568=52. So 52/98 is 0.5306. So total is 16.5306 mol. So approximately 16.53 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest I see is option J: 1620 g, 16.5 M, 33.0 N. Or option G: 1530g, 15.5 M. Hmm, but my calculation says 16.53 M. So 16.5 is option J's molarity. So J's molarity is 16.5.

But wait, let me think again. Did I make a mistake in calculating the mass? Let me double-check. 90% of 1800 is 0.9 *1800=1620. Yes. So that part seems right.

Wait, but another thing—sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid, right? So when calculating normality, each mole contributes 2 equivalents. So normality is molarity multiplied by 2. So if molarity is 16.53, normality is about 33.06 N. Looking at the options, J is 16.5 M, 33.0 N. That fits.

So according to that, the weight is 1620g, molarity 16.5 M, normality 33 N. So option J is correct.

But wait, looking at the options, option J is 1620 g, 16.5 M, 33.0 N. Which matches my calculations.

But wait, looking at the options given:

J: 1620 g, 16.5 M, 33.0 N.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but I thought the molarity was 16.53, but the option says 16.5. That's probably due to rounding; my calculation was approximate.

So the answers are: 1620 grams, 16.5 M, 33 N.

Looking back at the options, option J matches.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the total mass of the sulfuric acid solution. The density is given as 1.8 g/ml, and the volume is 1000 ml. Using the formula:

\[
\text{Mass of solution} = \text{Density} \times \text{Volume} = 1.8 \, \text{g/ml} \times 1000 \, \text{ml} = 1800 \, \text{g}.
\]

The solution is 90% H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) by weight, so the mass of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) is:

\[
\text{Mass of H}_2\text{SO}_4 = 0.9 \times 1800 \, \text{g} = 1620 \, \text{g}.
\]

Next, we calculate the molarity of the solution. The molar mass of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) is:

\[
\text{Molar mass of H}_2\text{SO}_4 = 2(1) + 32 + 4(16) = 98 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The number of moles of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) is:

\[
\text{Moles of H}_2\text{SO}_4 = \frac{\text{Mass of H}_2\text{SO}_4}{\text{Molar mass of H}_2\text{SO}_4} = \frac{1620 \, \text{g}}{98 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 16.53 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the volume of the solution is 1000 ml (or 1 liter), the molarity is:

\[
\text{Molarity} = \frac{\text{Moles of H}_2\text{SO}_4}{\text{Volume of solution in liters}} = \frac{16.53 \, \text{mol}}{1 \, \text{L}} \approx 16.53 \, \text{M}.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the molarity is approximately 16.5 M.

Finally, we calculate the normality. Since H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) is a diprotic acid, each mole contributes 2 equivalents. Thus, the normality is:

\[
\text{Normality} = \text{Molarity} \times 2 = 16.53 \times 2 \approx 33.06 \, \text{N}.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the normality is approximately 33.0 N.

Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**1620 g, 16.5 M, 33.0 N**, which corresponds to **Option J**.
