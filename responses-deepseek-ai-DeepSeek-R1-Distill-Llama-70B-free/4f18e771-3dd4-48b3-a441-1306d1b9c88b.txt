Okay, so I've got this question here about auditing and depreciation. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is asking which explanation would satisfy an auditor who's questioning significant debits to accumulated depreciation in the current year.

Wait, I remember that accumulated depreciation is a contra-asset account. So when you debit it, you're increasing it, which means the net value of the assets (plant assets in this case) goes down. But why would that happen?

Let me think about what each option means. 

Option A: Plant assets were retired. If a company retires assets, like selling them or disposing of them, then the depreciation for those assets would be removed. So that would cause a debit to accumulated depreciation because you're removing the accumulated part up to that point. That makes sense because when you get rid of an asset, you take out both the asset's cost and the accumulated depreciation. So that could explain a big increase in debits.

Option B: Prior years' depreciation was overstated. If they had too much depreciation before, that would mean the accumulated depreciation was too high. To correct that, you'd need to reduce accumulated depreciation, which would be a credit. So this would lead to a decrease, not an increase. So maybe this isn't the right choice.

Option C: Prior years’ depreciation was understated. If they didn't take enough depreciation before, then they'd need to catch up. That would mean increasing depreciation expense now, which would debit depreciation expense and credit accumulated depreciation. But wait, that's a credit, so this would actually reduce accumulated depreciation in the current year. Hmm, not sure about this one.

Option D: Revalued plant assets. If they changed the value of the assets, maybe upwards, but I'm not certain how that affects accumulated depreciation. Revaluation could go either way, but I think it's more about changing the asset's value, which might involve adjusting accumulated depreciation, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason for a significant debit.

Option E: Changed depreciation method. Like switching from straight-line to another method. If they change the method, the current year's depreciation would change. But a change in method would affect depreciation expense, which would then affect accumulated depreciation. But whether that leads to a significant debit depends on the change. For example, if they switch to a method that accelerates depreciation, then current year's depreciation would increase, leading to a higher credit to accumulated depreciation. Wait, no, wait. Accumulated depreciation is increased with a credit, not a debit. So if they're changing methods, they might have a larger credit, but the question is about a debit, which is an increase in the accumulated depreciation. Hmm, maybe not.

Option F: Current year’s depreciation was understated. That would mean they didn't book enough depreciation this year. So they might need to adjust it, which would involve a larger expense now. But that would mean a bigger credit to accumulated depreciation, not a debit. So this doesn't seem right.

Option G: Salvage value revised upward. Salvage value is the expected value at the end of an asset's life. If they increase salvage value, the depreciation each year decreases. So for the current year, if they increase salvage value, the depreciation expense would go down. That would mean a smaller credit to accumulated depreciation. But the question is about a significant debit, which would mean increasing accumulated depreciation. So I don't think this is it.

Option H: Remaining useful lives revised upward. Extending the useful life would decrease annual depreciation. So again, that would lead to less depreciation in the current year, which would mean a smaller addition to accumulated depreciation. So this doesn't explain a significant debit.

Option I: Significant purchases of plant assets. Buying more assets would mean more depreciation over their lives, but in the current year, the depreciation for new assets would start. However, the immediate effect on accumulated depreciation would be a credit when each month's depreciation is recorded. But this would spread out over time, not cause a big one-time debit. Unless they're capitalizing a lot at once, but I'm not sure if that's the main point here.

Wait, going back. The question is about significant debits, so an increase in accumulated depreciation. The normal operation is that each period, depreciation expense is debited, and accumulated depreciation is credited. So a debit to accumulated depreciation would be unusual except in specific cases.

One of those cases is when assets are sold or retired. Because when you retire an asset, you remove both the asset's cost and the accumulated depreciation up to that point. So that's a debit to accumulated depreciation (to remove it) and a credit to the asset account. So if a lot of assets were retired, that would cause a significant debit to accumulated depreciation. So that points to option A.

Another possibility is corrections. For example, if in prior years, the depreciation was understated (option C), then in the current year, they might need to record additional depreciation. But that would mean increasing depreciation expense (debit) and increasing accumulated depreciation (credit). So that's a credit, not a debit.

Wait, so if prior years' depreciation was understated, the current year's adjustment would be to record more depreciation. So that's a credit to accumulated depreciation, which is the normal way, but perhaps a bigger amount than usual. But the question is about a debit, so that doesn't fit.

Another scenario is if they had an error in the prior year's depreciation. Like, option B says prior depreciation was over. So to fix that, they would reduce accumulated depreciation, which is a debit. So if last year's depreciation was too high, then accumulated depreciation was too high. To correct, you debit accumulated depreciation and credit depreciation expense for the prior year. So that would cause a significant debit in the current year's accumulated depreciation. So option B could be a possibility.

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify. Let's say in year 1, they recorded too much depreciation. So their accumulated depreciation was higher than it should be. In year 2, when they find the error, they need to adjust for it. So they would reduce accumulated depreciation by the excess amount. To do that, they'd debit accumulated depreciation (because they're decreasing it) and credit depreciation expense (since they're reducing the overstatement). So that would indeed be a significant debit to accumulated depreciation in the current year. So option B could also explain it.

So now I have two possibilities: option A (retirements) and option B (prior overstatement corrected). Both could lead to significant debits.

Wait, but let me think again about the normal entries. When you retire an asset, you debit accumulated depreciation to remove it, which is a debit. So that's a one-time big debit. If you correct an error where prior depreciation was over, you'd also debit accumulated depreciation to reduce it. So both A and B could cause significant debits.

But what's the question again? It's asking which explanation would satisfy the auditor. So which scenario is more likely to cause a significant debit.

If a company retired a lot of assets, that would explain a big debit. Alternatively, correcting an error from prior years could also cause a big debit. So both A and B are possible.

Wait, but in the options, the options are about prior years' depreciation being overstated or understated. Let me think about the effect on accumulated depreciation.

If prior years' depreciation was overstated, accumulated depreciation is too high. So to correct, you need to decrease it, which requires a debit. So in the current year, you'd make a journal entry debiting accumulated depreciation and crediting depreciation expense (or maybe a prior period adjustment). That would cause a significant debit, which is what the auditor is seeing.

Similarly, if assets were retired, you have a significant debit as you remove accumulated depreciation.

So both A and B are possible. Wait, but the question is multiple choice with only one correct answer. So perhaps I need to think which is more likely to be the correct answer.

Looking back, the question is about an auditor's question. So they're probably looking for an error correction. But plant asset retirements are a normal part of business, so they might not be as surprising. But if there's a significant debit, perhaps the auditor is concerned it's an error.

Wait, but the question is asking which explanation would "most likely" satisfy the auditor. So which scenario is a valid reason for a significant debit.

In the case of asset retirement, that's a legitimate reason. So management could explain that they sold some assets, hence the debit. Similarly, correcting an error is also a valid reason.

But perhaps the more common reason for a significant debit is asset retirement. Whereas an error correction could also be a reason, but maybe less common.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option E, changing the depreciation method. Wait, no, that would affect the current year's expense but not necessarily cause a big debit to accumulated depreciation.

Wait, another thought: when you change the estimated useful life, it affects the current and future depreciation. For example, if in the current year, they extend the useful life, then the depreciation for the current year would decrease. But this would not cause a debit to accumulated depreciation. Instead, it would mean less credit in the current year.

Wait, but perhaps if they change the method, like from straight-line to double-declining balance, but that would affect future depreciation, not the accumulated so far.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to summarize.

The question is why is there a significant debit (increase) in accumulated depreciation. So we're looking for a transaction that causes a debit, which is not part of the regular depreciation recording.

Regular depreciation is a credit to accumulated depreciation each period. So a debit must come from something else.

Asset retirement: debit accumulated depreciation to remove it. So that fits.

Error correction: debit accumulated depreciation to reduce it because prior years were over-depreciated. So that also fits.

So both A and B are possible. But which option is in the choices?

Looking at the options, option B is "Prior years' depreciation expenses were erroneously overstated."

So if this is the case, then management would explain that they found an error where last year's depreciation was too high, so they're correcting it this year by reducing accumulated depreciation, which requires a debit.

Similarly, option A, plant assets retired, would also cause a debit.

So now I have to decide which option is the correct answer. The question is which explanation would satisfy the auditor. Both A and B seem plausible.

Wait, but the other options: for example, option E is a change in depreciation method. That would affect the current year's depreciation, but I don't think it would cause a significant debit to accumulated depreciation, unless they are restating prior years, which might require a prior period adjustment.

But in that case, the entry would involve a debit to accumulated depreciation if prior years' depreciation was understated. Wait, no: if prior years' depreciation was understated, then they need to increase accumulated depreciation, which is a credit. So that would not cause a debit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what typically causes a debit to accumulated depreciation. The main cause is the retirement of assets, because you remove the accumulated depreciation. So option A would be a correct reason. Also, correcting an error where prior depreciation was over-recorded (option B) would also require a debit. So both could be correct.

Wait, but the question is about "explanations" for significant debits. So which one is more likely to be the reason.

In auditing, if there are significant debits, the auditor would question whether the company is writing off assets, perhaps without proper authorization, or if there's some error.

But the question is about which explanation would satisfy the auditor. So if management says they retired assets, that would make sense. If they say they corrected an error, that would also make sense.

But looking at the options, both A and B are possible. But in the options, only one answer is correct. So perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is E, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: when you change the estimated salvage value, that affects future depreciation, but again, it doesn't cause a debit to accumulated depreciation.

If the company made significant purchases (option I), that would increase the plant assets and also increase future depreciation. But the immediate effect on accumulated depreciation would be minimal unless they started depreciating immediately.

So back to the initial thought: the most likely explanations are A and B.

The question is about "significant debits" in the current year. So if they retired a lot of assets, that would cause a significant debit. If they corrected an error where prior years were over-depreciated, that would also cause a significant debit.

So which one is the correct answer? The options are A through I, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, perhaps I should look up what causes a debit to accumulated depreciation. From what I remember, it's usually when assets are sold or retired, or when there's a prior period adjustment decreasing accumulated depreciation (like correcting an overstatement).

So in this case, both A and B would cause a debit. So which one is the correct option?

Looking at the question again, the options are:

A: Plant assets were retired during the current year.

B: Prior years' depreciation expenses were erroneously overstated.

So if the answer is A, then the reasoning is asset retirement. If it's B, then it's an error correction.

But which one is more likely to be the correct answer in the context of this question?

I think the intended answer is A, because it's a common reason for a significant debit. However, B is also a valid reason.

Wait, in the options, the correct answer is E? No, option E is about changing the depreciation method, which I don't think leads to a significant debit.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E. No, because changing the method affects future depreciation, not accumulated depreciation directly.

Wait, let's think about each option again.

Option A: Plant assets were retired. So when assets are sold, you debit accumulated depreciation to remove it, which is a significant debit.

Option B: Prior years' depreciation was over. To correct, you debit accumulated depreciation, which is a significant debit.

So both A and B are correct, but the options don't allow for that.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. I might need to pick the best answer.

Wait, in practice, when a company has significant debits to accumulated depreciation, the most common reason is asset retirements or sales. So I think the answer is A.

But in the options given, perhaps the correct answer is A.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is E, but I'm not sure.

No, I think I'll go with option A as the most likely correct answer.

The question asks which explanation would most likely satisfy an auditor who questions significant debits to accumulated depreciation in the current year. Accumulated depreciation is a contra-asset account, and a debit to this account indicates an increase, which is unusual since the normal operation involves crediting it through depreciation expense.

### Analysis of Options:

- **Option A: Plant assets were retired during the current year.**  
  When assets are retired, the accumulated depreciation related to those assets is removed. This requires a debit to accumulated depreciation, which would explain a significant increase. This is a common and legitimate reason for such a debit.

- **Option B: Prior years' depreciation expenses were erroneously overstated.**  
  If prior years' depreciation was overstated, accumulated depreciation would have been too high. Correcting this error would require a debit to accumulated depreciation to reduce it to the correct amount. This is another valid explanation for a significant debit.

- **Option C: Prior years’ depreciation expenses were erroneously understated.**  
  If prior years' depreciation was understated, accumulated depreciation would be too low. Correcting this would require additional depreciation, which would involve a credit to accumulated depreciation, not a debit. This does not explain the significant debit.

- **Option D: The company revalued its plant assets during the current year.**  
  Revaluing plant assets could affect their carrying value, but it does not directly explain a significant debit to accumulated depreciation. This is unlikely to be the correct answer.

- **Option E: The estimated depreciation method was changed during the current year.**  
  Changing the depreciation method affects future depreciation calculations but does not typically result in a significant debit to accumulated depreciation. This is not a likely explanation.

- **Option F: Current year’s depreciation expense was erroneously understated.**  
  If the current year's depreciation was understated, it would require additional depreciation, which would involve a credit to accumulated depreciation, not a debit. This does not explain the significant debit.

- **Option G: The salvage value of the plant assets was revised upward.**  
  Increasing salvage value reduces depreciation expense, leading to a smaller credit to accumulated depreciation. This does not explain a significant debit.

- **Option H: The estimated remaining useful lives of plant assets were revised upward.**  
  Extending the useful life of assets reduces annual depreciation, leading to a smaller credit to accumulated depreciation. This does not explain a significant debit.

- **Option I: The company made significant purchases of plant assets in the current year.**  
  Purchasing new assets increases depreciation over their useful lives, but this would not cause a significant one-time debit to accumulated depreciation. This is not a likely explanation.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanations for significant debits to accumulated depreciation are **Option A** (plant assets were retired) and **Option B** (prior years' depreciation was erroneously overstated). However, the question asks for the single most likely explanation. Asset retirements are a common and straightforward reason for significant debits to accumulated depreciation, making **Option A** the best answer.
