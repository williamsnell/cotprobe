Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this accounting question about how a stock issuance is reported in the statement of cash flows. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that Ace Co. issued 1000 shares of $10 par value common stock for $15 per share in cash. I need to determine how this transaction affects the cash flow statement.

First, I remember that the statement of cash flows is divided into three main sections: operating, investing, and financing activities. Each section tracks cash inflows and outflows from different business activities.

In this case, Ace is issuing stock. Issuing shares of stock is a financing activity because it relates to how the company is funding its operations—through equity. So, the cash received from issuing stock should be recorded under financing activities.

Now, the total cash received here is 1000 shares multiplied by $15 per share. Let me calculate that: 1000 * 15 = $15,000. So, Ace received $15,000 in cash from this transaction.

I should also consider the par value. The par value is $10 per share, so 1000 shares would be 1000 * 10 = $10,000. But wait, in the cash flow statement, the total cash received is the amount they actually get, which is the $15,000. The par value is more relevant for the balance sheet, where common stock is recorded at par, and the excess goes into additional paid-in capital. But for the cash flow statement, it's the cash inflow that matters.

So the entire $15,000 is a cash inflow from financing activities. None of this would go under operating or investing because it's a direct result of the company financing itself through equity.

Looking at the options, option C says "$15,000 cash inflow from financing activities." That sounds right. Let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A suggests it's operating, which it's not. Operating activities are things like cash from sales or expenses. Option B splits it into $10,000 financing and $5,000 investing—no, that doesn't make sense because the entire $15k is financing. Option D says no impact, but clearly cash is coming in. E is investing activities, which is for things like buying or selling assets, not stock issuance. F is a cash outflow, which is wrong because it's an inflow. G and H mix investing and operating, which aren't right. I and J also split the amounts and categories incorrectly.

So yeah, the correct answer must be C.

The transaction involves Ace Co. issuing 1000 shares of $10 par value common stock for $15 per share in cash. The total cash received is $15,000 (1000 shares * $15 per share). Since issuing stock is a financing activity, the entire $15,000 should be reported as a cash inflow under financing activities in the statement of cash flows. Other options either misclassify the activity or incorrectly split the cash flow between different sections. 

The correct answer is:

C: $15000 cash inflow from financing activities.
