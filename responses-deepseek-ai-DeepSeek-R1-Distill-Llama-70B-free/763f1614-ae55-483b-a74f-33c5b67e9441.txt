Question:

A law student and two friends were at a mall peacefully handing out fliers in protest of U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or they would be arrested. They returned the next day and continued to leaflet. The police came again and issued another warning. The law student left to avoid arrest, but the police arrested his companions for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student, in an attempt to get an advance ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes, filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court asking for declaratory relief. Based on Supreme Court precedent will the federal district court dismiss the declaratory judgment action?

Options:

A: Yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.
B: No, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.
C: No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.
D: Yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about federal courts and declaratory judgments. Hmm, I remember that declaratory judgments are a way for someone to get a court's opinion on the validity of a law before they're actually charged with a crime. But the specifics are a bit fuzzy for me. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about a law student and his friends handing out fliers in a mall. They were protesting U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner called the police, who warned them to stop or face arrest. They went back the next day and continued. The police came again, gave another warning, and when the law student left to avoid arrest, the others got arrested for criminal trespass and loitering.

Now, the law student wants a declaratory judgment in federal court to get an advance ruling on whether those statutes are constitutional. The question is whether the federal court will dismiss the action based on Supreme Court precedent.

I think the key here is whether the plaintiff (the law student) has standing and whether the case is ripe for judicial review. Also, I remember something about the federal courts exercising discretion when it comes to declaratory judgments, especially regarding state laws.

So, the options are A through D. Let me go through them.

Option A says yes because it would interfere with existing state prosecutions and comity. But wait, the law student himself hasn't been prosecuted yet, right? His companions were arrested, but he left. So the state is prosecuting others, not him. But does that matter? I'm not sure. Comity usually refers to respect between state and federal courts. If the state is already prosecuting, maybe the federal court should stay out. But I don't think that's the main issue here. The law student isn't part of that prosecution.

Option B says no because a federal plaintiff can seek a declaratory judgment even without a state prosecution. I think this might relate to cases where the plaintiff is facing a credible threat of prosecution. But I'm not certain. I recall that to get a declaratory judgment, you need a real and immediate threat, not just a speculative one.

Option C says no because the law student can show a genuine threat, as his friends were arrested and he was warned. That makes sense. The prior warnings and the arrest of others could indicate that if he continues, he might be arrested. So there's a genuine threat, making his case ripe.

Option D says yes because his fears are speculative. But wait, he did receive warnings, and his companions were arrested. That seems more than speculative. So D might not be correct because the threat isn't just in his head; there's actual evidence.

I remember the case of Steffel v. Thompson, where the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff can bring a declaratory judgment action if they can show a genuine threat of prosecution. In that case, the plaintiff had been threatened with arrest for distributing literature without a permit, similar to the situation here.

So, applying that, the law student was warned, and his friends were arrested. That shows a credible threat. Therefore, the federal court shouldn't dismiss the case. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. The issue is whether the court has discretion to refuse the declaratory judgment. Or is it more about standing and ripeness? The law student hasn't been arrested yet, but he's challenging the constitutionality of the statutes. The Supreme Court in some cases has allowed such challenges when there's a credible threat of prosecution.

In the case of Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, the Court discussed the ripeness doctrine. It said that when there's a credible threat of enforcement, the issue is ripe. So here, the law student has a credible threat because he was warned, and others were arrested for the same activity.

So the federal court would likely not dismiss the case, making the answer C.

Alternatively, what about the Younger v. Harris case? That's about federal courts abstaining when there's an ongoing state prosecution. But in this case, the law student isn't part of the state prosecution; his companions are. So Younger might not apply here. The court can still hear the declaratory judgment because the plaintiff isn't involved in the state case.

So putting it all together, the answer is C: No, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.

The question revolves around whether a federal district court will dismiss a declaratory judgment action brought by a law student challenging the constitutionality of state criminal statutes. The law student, who was warned by police but not arrested, seeks an advance ruling after his companions were arrested for the same activities. The key issues are standing, ripeness, and the discretion of federal courts in granting declaratory relief.

- **Option A** suggests dismissal due to interference with state prosecutions and comity. However, the law student is not part of the ongoing state prosecutions, and comity is not the central issue here. This makes A less likely.

- **Option B** argues that a federal plaintiff can seek declaratory relief even without a state prosecution. While this is true, the plaintiff must still demonstrate a credible threat of prosecution, which is not explicitly addressed in this option.

- **Option C** states that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement, supported by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings. This aligns with Supreme Court precedent, such as *Steffel v. Thompson*, where a credible threat of prosecution establishes standing and ripeness for a declaratory judgment.

- **Option D** claims the action is premature because the law student's fears are speculative. However, the warnings and the arrest of his companions provide concrete evidence of a credible threat, making this option incorrect.

Based on *Steffel v. Thompson* and *Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner*, the law student has standing and the case is ripe for judicial review due to the genuine threat of enforcement. The federal court is unlikely to dismiss the action, making **Option C** the correct answer.

Answer: C
