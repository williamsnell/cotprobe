Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out which statement is false. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about the Nuremberg and Tokyo war crimes trials. I remember these trials were significant after World War II, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A says the trials took place immediately after the First World War. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. I think the Nuremberg trials were after WWII, not WWI. So A is probably false.

Option B states that "superior orders" couldn't be used as a defense. I recall that the Nuremberg trials established that following orders isn't a valid excuse for committing war crimes, so B is true.

Option C mentions introducing 'crime against humanity' as an offense. I believe these trials did define that, so C is correct.

Option D says the trials were held after WWII but before the UN was created. Wait, the UN was established in 1945, right? And the Nuremberg trials were in 1945-46. So they were after the UN's creation? Or maybe D is correct if the UN was created after the trials started. Hmm, I might need to double-check that. Or perhaps the UN was formed before the trials. Wait, the UN came into existence in October 1945, and the Nuremberg trials began in November 1945. So the trials were after the UN was created, making D false? Wait no, D says the trials were before the UN's creation. So if the UN was created in 1945 and the trials started the same year, maybe after. So perhaps D is incorrect. Wait, this needs more thought. Wait, the UN Charter was signed in June 1945, but the organization came into existence in October when the five permanent members ratified it. The Nuremberg trials started in November 1945, so technically after the UN was established. So D is false because it says the trials were before the UN's creation. So D is incorrect? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The UN was created before the trials started, so D is false.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is false. So if A is wrong because the trials were after WWII, not WWI, then A is false. But let's check the other options.

Option E says the trials were conducted by the UN. I think the Allied powers conducted them, not the UN itself. So E is false. Because the UN didn't really exist yet in a strong form, or maybe it wasn't the UN that conducted the trials. So E is incorrect.

Option F claims the trials were in the US. No, Nuremberg was in Germany, Tokyo in Japan. So F is false.

Option G states the trials didn't include genocide. Wait, the term genocide was coined around that time, but I think the Nuremberg trials didn't specifically include genocide as a charge. So G is true, meaning that statement is correct, so it's not the false one.

Option H says individuals were held responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Yes, that's correct. So H is true.

Now, to recap:

The question is which statement is false.

Looking at each option:

A: Trials after WWI? No, after WWII. So A is false.

B: True.

C: True.

D: Trials after WWII but before UN. No, UN was created before the trials started. So D is false.

Wait, but when were the trials? Nuremberg started in 1945, same year UN was established. So if the trials were in 1945, after the UN's creation in October, then D is false because it claims the trials were before the UN's creation.

Wait, but the trials were held after the UN was created. So D says they were held before, which is false. So D is a false statement.

Wait, but the question is which statement is false, and there might be multiple false ones, but the question states only one is false.

Wait, let me think again. The Nuremberg trials started in November 1945, after the UN was established in October. So D is incorrect because it says they were before the UN's creation.

So D is false.

Earlier, I thought A was false because it said the trials took place after WWI, which is wrong. So both A and D are false? But the question says only one is false.

Wait, let me re-examine the options.

Option A: Nuremberg and Tokyo took place immediately after WWI. No, they were after WWII, so A is definitely false.

Option D: Trials were held after WWII, but before the UN was created. Wait, the UN was created in 1945, and the trials started in 1945 as well. So perhaps the trials were after the UN was created, making D false.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting possibilities here. Let's check the timeline.

The United Nations Charter was signed on June 26, 1945, and came into force on October 24, 1945. The Nuremberg trials began on November 20, 1945. So the trials started after the UN was officially established. Therefore, D says the trials were held before the UN's creation, which is false. So D is false.

But A is also false because it's about WWI, not WWII.

Wait, the question asks which one is false, so perhaps more than one is false, but the options are given as A-J, and only one is correct as the answer.

Wait, but the options are A to J, but the choices are from A to H. So in this case, both A and D seem to be false, but I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct. Because the UN was formed in 1945, and the trials were held in 1945 and 1946. So technically, the trials were after the UN's creation, making D incorrect because it says the trials were before the UN was created.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is false. So if both A and D are false, but the question expects only one, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the creation of the UN with when it started functioning. Let me think again.

The UN was established in 1945, so the trials were after that. Therefore, D is false because it says trials were before UN's creation.

So, if the question is which statement is false, A is false because the trials were after WWII, and D is also false because the trials were after the UN's creation. But perhaps D is correct? Or perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the Nuremberg trials were conducted by the Allied powers, not the UN. So option E is false because it says the trials were conducted by the UN. So E is also false.

Wait, so now I'm getting multiple false options, but the question says only one is false.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back.

The question asks which statement is false.

Looking again:

Option A: Trials after WWI? No, so A is false.

Option D: Trials after WWII, before UN creation. No, because UN was created before trials. So D is false.

Option E: Conducted by UN? No, by Allies. So E is false.

Wait, so A, D, E are all false. But the question expects only one answer. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about some points. Let me check each option carefully.

Option A: The war crimes trials at Nuremberg and Tokyo took place immediately after the First World War.

Wait, no, they were after WWII, so A is false.

Option D: The war crimes trials were held after the Second World War, but before the creation of the United Nations.

Wait, the UN was created in 1945, same year as the trials started. So if the trials were in late 1945, after the UN was established, then D is false.

Option E: The war crimes trials were conducted by the United Nations.

No, the trials were conducted by the Allied powers, not the UN. So E is false.

Hmm, so now I'm seeing three options as false, which can't be right because the question says only one is false. I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the Nuremberg trials were before the UN was created. Let me check the exact dates.

The UN came into existence on October 24, 1945, when the five permanent members ratified the charter. The Nuremberg trials started on November 20, 1945. So the trials started after the UN was created, making D's statement false.

But option A is definitely false because the trials were after WWII, not WWI.

So now I have A and D as false.

Wait, but the question is which statement is false, so perhaps the answer is A, because it's clearly wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering whether the trials were conducted by the UN or not. The Nuremberg trials were conducted by the four Allied powers: US, UK, France, and USSR. So E is false because it says the UN conducted them.

Now I'm really confused because I have A, D, and E as false. But the question says only one is false.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on each option again.

The correct facts are:

- Nuremberg and Tokyo trials after WWII, so A is false.

- "Superior orders" not a defense: B is true.

- Introduced crime against humanity: C is true.

- Trials after WWII but before UN? No, because UN was created in 1945, trials same year: D is false.

- Conducted by UN? No: E is false.

- Trials in US? No, in Germany and Japan: F is false.

- Did not include genocide? G is true because genocide wasn't part of the charges then.

- Individuals held responsible: H is true.

Wait, this suggests that A, D, E, F are false. But that can't be right because the question expects only one false statement.

I must have made a mistake. Let me clarify:

Option D says the trials were held after WWII but before the creation of the UN. Since the UN was created in 1945 and the trials started in 1945, after the UN's creation, D is false.

Option A is also false because it refers to after WWI.

Option E is false because the trials were not conducted by the UN.

Option F is false because the trials were in Germany and Japan, not the US.

So, perhaps multiple options are false, but the question expects only one. Therefore, I must have misunderstood some facts.

Wait, perhaps the trials were conducted under the auspices of the UN? No, I think the UN didn't exist yet in a functional way. The Allied powers set up the tribunals.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A, as it's clearly false because the trials were after WWII.

Alternatively, the question might consider only one false option, so perhaps A is the intended answer.

But wait, looking back, perhaps the question is about which statement is false. So I'll go through each option again.

Option A: Wrong, trials after WWII.

Option B: Correct.

Option C: Correct.

Option D: Trials after WWII but before UN? No, UN was created before, so D is false.

Option E: Trials conducted by UN? No, so E is false.

Option F: Trials in the US? No, so F is false.

Option G: Correct, genocide wasn't included.

Option H: Correct.

So, the false options are A, D, E, F. But the question says only one is false, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in understanding the options.

Wait, perhaps the UN was created after the trials. No, that's not correct. The UN was established before the trials started.

Wait, perhaps the trials were held before the UN was officially in existence. Because the UN Charter was signed in June 1945, but the organization came into existence in October 1945. The Nuremberg trials started in November 1945, after the UN's existence began. So D is false because it says the trials were before the UN's creation.

Option F: Trials took place in the US? No, Nuremberg was in Germany, Tokyo in Japan. So F is false.

Option E: Conducted by UN? No, so E is false.

So, again, multiple options are false. But the question expects only one. Therefore, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the intended answer is A.

Wait, the question asks which statement is false. So perhaps the correct answer is A, as it's clearly wrong.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. Which option is definitely false?

Option A: Trials after WWI? No, after WWII. So A is false.

Option F: Trials in the US? No, so F is false.

So both A and F are false. But the question expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A and F are both false, but I have to choose one.

Alternatively, perhaps the trials were held in the US. Wait, no, Nuremberg is in Germany, Tokyo in Japan. So F is definitely false.

Wait, but the question is which one is false. So perhaps the answer is A.

But I'm getting confused because multiple options seem false. Alternatively, perhaps only one is false, and I'm misremembering.

Wait, perhaps the trials were conducted by the UN. No, that's not correct. So E is false.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to list each option's correctness.

A: False. Trials after WWII, not WWI.

B: True.

C: True.

D: False. Trials after UN creation.

E: False. Conducted by Allies, not UN.

F: False. Trials in Germany and Japan.

G: True.

H: True.

So, the false statements are A, D, E, F.

But the question says only one is false, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding some points.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about D. Let me check the timeline again.

The UN was established in 1945, same year as the trials. So the trials were after the UN's creation, making D's statement false because it says they were before.

So, D is false.

Similarly, A is false.

So, the question expects only one answer, but I'm seeing A and D as false.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the creation of the UN as a process, not the official date. So the trials were before the UN was fully operational, but that's speculative.

I think the best approach is to pick the most clearly false statement. Option A is clearly false because it refers to the wrong war. So the answer is A.
</think>

To determine which statement is false, let's analyze each option carefully:

**Option A**: "The war crimes trials at Nuremberg and Tokyo took place immediately after the First World War."  
This is false because the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials occurred after World War II, not World War I.

**Option B**: "The war crimes trials found that 'superior orders' could not be used as a defence for war crimes or crimes against humanity."  
This is true. The Nuremberg trials established that following superior orders is not a valid defense for such crimes.

**Option C**: "The war crimes trials introduced a 'crime against humanity' as an offence."  
This is true. The Nuremberg trials defined and prosecuted crimes against humanity.

**Option D**: "The war crimes trials were held after the Second World War, but before the creation of the United Nations."  
This is false. The United Nations was established in 1945, and the Nuremberg trials began in November 1945, after the UN's creation.

**Option E**: "The war crimes trials were conducted by the United Nations."  
This is false. The trials were conducted by the Allied powers, not the United Nations.

**Option F**: "The war crimes trials at Nuremberg and Tokyo took place in the United States."  
This is false. The Nuremberg trials were held in Germany, and the Tokyo trials were held in Japan.

**Option G**: "The war crimes trials did not include the crime of genocide."  
This is true. Genocide was not explicitly included as a charge in the Nuremberg trials.

**Option H**: "The war crimes trials held individuals legally responsible for acts such as war crimes and crimes against humanity."  
This is true. The trials established individual responsibility for such acts.

### Conclusion:
Multiple statements (A, D, E, F) are false. However, the question specifies identifying only one false statement. The most clearly false statement is **A**, as it incorrectly associates the trials with World War I instead of World War II.

**Answer: A**
