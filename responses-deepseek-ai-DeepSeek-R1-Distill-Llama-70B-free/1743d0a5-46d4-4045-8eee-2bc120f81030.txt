Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the true rate of interest. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. 

The problem says that a sum of money is borrowed for one year, and it's discounted at a rate of 6%. I need to find the true rate of interest charged. Then, I have to do the same for an 8% discount rate. The options given are from A to J, each with two percentages. 

Wait, I remember something about simple interest and discount rates. Oh right! The discount rate is different from the simple interest rate. I think the formula for the true rate involves the discount. Let me recall the formula.

I think the formula is: 

True Rate (R) = (Discount / (Principal - Discount)) * 100

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the present value (PV) and future value (FV) are involved. Let me think. 

The discount is calculated on the future value. So, the formula might be:

Discount = (Rate * Principal * Time) / (1 + Rate * Time)

Wait, no, that's for something else. Alternatively, the present value is equal to the future value divided by (1 + rate). But when it's discounted, maybe it's a simple interest calculation.

Wait another approach. If a sum is discounted at a certain rate, say 6%, then the amount received is less than the face value. So, the discount is the interest paid in advance.

For example, if I borrow $100 for a year at a 6% discount, the discount would be $6. So, I receive $94 now, and after a year, I pay back $100. The interest I'm paying is $6 on a $94 principal. So the true interest rate would be (6/94)*100.

Let me calculate that. 6 divided by 94 is approximately 0.0638, which is 6.38%. Rounded to the nearest tenth, that's 6.4%. Wait no, wait wait. Let me check my math again.

Wait wait, the discount is 6% of the face value. So, for a face value of, say, $100, the discount is $6, so the borrower gets $94. The interest is $6 on $94. So the true rate is 6/94 *100. Let me compute 6/94.

6 ÷ 94 equals approximately 0.0638 or 6.38%, which rounds to 6.4%. But wait, looking at the options, 6.4% is an option in E, but let me see what else I've got. 

Wait another thought: Maybe I'm mixing up discount and interest. Let me get the formula right. 

The true interest rate can be calculated using the formula:

R = (D / (P - D)) * 100

Where D is the discount, and P is the face value or principal.

In the first case, discount D is 6% of P, so D = 0.06P. So substituting in:

R = (0.06P) / (P - 0.06P) * 100 = (0.06P) / (0.94P) * 100. The P cancels out, so 0.06/0.94 = 0.0638 or 6.38%, which is 6.4% when rounded to the nearest tenth. 

So for the first part, the true rate is 6.4%. Now, looking at the options, let's see which option starts with 6.4% for the first answer. 

Looking at the options:

A: 6.2, 8.5

B: 6.1, 8.2

C:5.9,8.0

D:6.0,8.6

E:6.4,8.7

F:6.8,8.9

G:6.3,8.1

H:7.0,8.8

I:6.7,8.4

J:6.5,8.3

So E is 6.4%, which is the first part. But wait, the second part of the question is when the discount is 8%. So let me compute that.

So D is 8% of P, D=0.08P. Then R = (0.08P)/(P - 0.08P) *100 = 0.08/0.92 *100. Let me compute this.

0.08 divided by 0.92 equals approximately 0.087. So 8.7%. Let me compute it more accurately: 0.08 ÷ 0.92. 92 goes into 80.000 how many times? 92*0.08 is 7.36, so 0.8 is about 0.00869? Wait, let me compute 0.08/0.92.

Wait, 0.08 / 0.92 = 8/92 = 2/23. Let me compute 2 ÷ 23. 23*0.08 is 1.84. 23*0.087 is about 2.001. So 2/23 ≈ 0.087, so 8.7%. So the true rate is 8.7%.

So the first part is 6.4%, second is 8.7%. Looking at the options, option E is 6.4%, 8.7% which matches exactly.

Wait, but let me double-check my approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternative approach: The true interest rate is calculated based on the present value. So, if the discount is 6%, then the present value is P - D = P(1 - r_d), where r_d is the discount rate. So P_present = P_future * (1 - r_d). 

But the true interest rate r is calculated on the present value. So, the amount paid after one year is P_future = P_present * (1 + r). 

So, substituting P_present = P_future * (1 - r_d), then P_future = P_present * (1 + r) = [P_future (1 - r_d)] * (1 + r). 

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of equations.

Let me define:

Face Value (F) = the amount to be received in the future (e.g., $100).

Discount (D) = r_d * F.

The present value (PV) is F - D = F*(1 - r_d).

The true interest rate is the rate that makes PV grow to F in one year. So,

F = PV * (1 + R), where R is the true rate.

So, PV = F*(1 - r_d) = F/(1 + R)

Wait, no, wait: 

Wait, F = PV * (1 + R), so PV = F/(1 + R) = F*(1 - r_d).

So, 1/(1 + R) = 1 - r_d.

Thus, 1 + R = 1/(1 - r_d)

So, R = [1/(1 - r_d)] - 1 = [1 - (1 - r_d)] / (1 - r_d) ) = r_d / (1 - r_d )

Which is the same formula I used before. So R = r_d / (1 - r_d )

So for r_d = 6% = 0.06,

R = 0.06/(1 - 0.06) = 0.06/0.94 ≈ 0.0638 → 6.38%, rounds to 6.4%.

Similarly, for r_d = 8% = 0.08,

R = 0.08/(1 - 0.08)= 0.08/0.92 ≈ 0.087 → 8.7%.

So yes, that's correct. So the two true rates are 6.4% and 8.7%, which is option E.

To determine the true rate of interest for a sum of money discounted at a given rate, the formula used is:

\[
R = \frac{r_d}{1 - r_d}
\]

where \( R \) is the true rate of interest and \( r_d \) is the discount rate.

### Case 1: Discount Rate = 6%
Given \( r_d = 6\% = 0.06 \), substituting into the formula:

\[
R = \frac{0.06}{1 - 0.06} = \frac{0.06}{0.94} \approx 0.0638 \, \text{or} \, 6.38\%.
\]

Rounding to the nearest tenth, the true rate is **6.4%**.

### Case 2: Discount Rate = 8%
Given \( r_d = 8\% = 0.08 \), substituting into the formula:

\[
R = \frac{0.08}{1 - 0.08} = \frac{0.08}{0.92} \approx 0.087 \, \text{or} \, 8.7\%.
\]

Rounding to the nearest tenth, the true rate is **8.7%**.
