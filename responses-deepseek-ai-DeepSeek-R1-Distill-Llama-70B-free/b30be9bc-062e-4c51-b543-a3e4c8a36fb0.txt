Okay, so I've got this question about functions and sets, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that we have two sets, A and B. There's a function f that goes from A to B, so f: A → B. And another function g that goes from B to A, so g: B → A. The condition given is that for every element a in A, when we apply f and then g, we get back a. In other words, g(f(a)) = a for all a in A.

Then there are two statements. Statement 1 says that g must necessarily be injective, and Statement 2 says g must necessarily be surjective. The options given are combinations of whether each statement is true or false or not necessarily so.

Alright, first, I need to remember what injective and surjective mean. Injective (or one-to-one) means that if g(x) = g(y), then x must equal y. Surjective (or onto) means that for every element in A, there's at least one element in B that maps to it via g.

So, the condition given is that g composed with f is the identity function on A. I think this might imply some properties about g and f.

Let me think about what this means. Since g(f(a)) = a, every element a in A is mapped back to itself after going through f and g. So, f takes a from A to some element in B, and then g brings it back to a. 

Wait, so for each a in A, f(a) is some element in B, and g of that element is a. So that means that g is mapping elements from B back to A. But what does that tell me about g's properties?

I remember that if a function has a left inverse, then it's injective. Wait, in this case, g is acting like a left inverse for f. Because f: A→B, and g: B→A, and g∘f = id_A. So f is a right inverse of g.

Wait, maybe I got that backwards. Let me clarify. The composition g∘f equals the identity on A. So, if I consider functions, the composition order is important. Function composition is applied from right to left, so g∘f means f is applied first, then g.

In this scenario, g∘f is the identity on A. So for any a in A, f takes it to B, then g brings it back.

So, what does this imply about the functions f and g?

I think that if g∘f is injective, then f must be injective. Because if f weren't injective, then g∘f wouldn't be either. But wait, g∘f is the identity, which is injective. So f must be injective.

Wait, but the question is about g, not f. So what can we say about g?

Hmm. Let's think about injectivity first. Suppose g is not injective. Then there exist elements b1 and b2 in B such that g(b1) = g(b2), but b1 ≠ b2. Does that contradict our condition?

Well, let's see. If I take a = g(b1), then f(a) = f(g(b1)), and g(f(a)) should equal a. But wait, g(f(g(b1))) = g(b1) since g∘f is identity on A. So g(f(g(b1))) = g(b1). Similarly for b2, g(f(g(b2))) = g(b2). But if g(b1) = g(b2), then f(g(b1)) = f(g(b2)).

Wait, no, because f is a function from A to B. So f(g(b1)) and f(g(b2)) are in B. But if g(b1) = g(b2), then f(g(b1)) must equal f(g(b2)) because f is a function. So that would mean that f sends the same element in A to the same element in B, which is fine. But then, g of those would have to be equal to g(b1) and g(b2) respectively. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should approach this differently.

If g∘f is injective, then f must be injective. Because if f(a1) = f(a2), then g(f(a1)) = g(f(a2)), which would mean a1 = a2, so f is injective.

But what about g? Is g necessarily injective? Suppose that g is not injective. Then there are two different elements in B that g maps to the same element in A. Let's say g(b1) = g(b2) = a, where b1 ≠ b2. Now, applying f to a, since f is a function, f(a) would be some element in B, say b. Then, g(b) would be a again. So g(f(a)) = a, which is consistent with our condition.

Wait, but what about g(b1) and g(b2)? Since they are both a, then f(a) is b, so g(b) is a. So, when I look at g(b1), it's a, and f(a) is b. So, does g(b1) equal g(f(a))? Yes, because g(b1) is a, and g(f(a)) is a. But that doesn't necessarily mean that b1 equals f(a), does it? Because g might map multiple elements in B to the same a in A.

So, in this case, g is not injective, but the condition g∘f = id_A still holds. So, does that mean that g doesn't have to be injective?

Wait, but if g is not injective, then there exist b1 and b2 in B such that g(b1) = g(b2) but b1 ≠ b2. Now, let's look at f(g(b1)) and f(g(b2)). Since g(b1) = g(b2) = a, then f(a) is some b in B. So, f(g(b1)) = f(a) = b and f(g(b2)) = f(a) = b. So, f(g(b1)) = f(g(b2)), but b1 and b2 are different. So, what does that say about the function f? It says that f(a) is the same for a coming from different b's in B. But since f is a function from A to B, that's okay. 

Therefore, the fact that g is not injective doesn't violate the condition. So, g doesn't have to be injective. So, Statement 1 says that g must necessarily be injective. But from this example, I can have a g that is not injective and still satisfy the condition. So, Statement 1 is False.

Now, what about Statement 2: g must necessarily be surjective. 

Surjective means that for every a in A, there exists a b in B such that g(b) = a. But wait, in our condition, for every a in A, g(f(a)) = a. So, for each a in A, f(a) is an element in B, and g(f(a)) = a. So, that means that for every a in A, there exists at least one element in B (specifically f(a)) that maps to a via g. Therefore, g is surjective over A. 

Wait, yes. Because the definition of surjective is that every element in the codomain (A) is mapped to by at least one element in the domain (B). So, for each a in A, f(a) is in B, and g(f(a)) = a. So, g is surjective. 

So, Statement 2 is True.

Putting it together: Statement 1 is False, Statement 2 is True. So, looking at the options, option C is False, True. So, the answer should be C.

To analyze the given problem, we consider two sets \( A \) and \( B \), and functions \( f: A \to B \) and \( g: B \to A \), with the condition that \( g(f(a)) = a \) for all \( a \in A \). This means that \( g \circ f \) is the identity function on \( A \). We evaluate the two statements:

1. **Statement 1: The function \( g \) must necessarily be injective.**  
   A function is injective if \( g(x) = g(y) \) implies \( x = y \). However, the condition \( g(f(a)) = a \) does not guarantee that \( g \) is injective. For example, \( g \) could map multiple elements in \( B \) to the same element in \( A \), as long as \( g(f(a)) = a \) holds. Thus, \( g \) is not necessarily injective, and Statement 1 is **False**.

2. **Statement 2: The function \( g \) must necessarily be surjective.**  
   A function is surjective if for every \( a \in A \), there exists at least one \( b \in B \) such that \( g(b) = a \). The condition \( g(f(a)) = a \) ensures that for every \( a \in A \), \( f(a) \) is an element in \( B \) that maps to \( a \) via \( g \). Therefore, \( g \) is surjective, and Statement 2 is **True**.

Combining these results, Statement 1 is False, and Statement 2 is True. The correct option is **C: False, True**.
