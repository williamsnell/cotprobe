Alright, so I have this question about the retributive theory of punishment, and I need to figure out which statement it doesn't claim. Hmm, okay, let's start by understanding what retributive theory is all about. From what I remember, retribution is about punishment being a form of desertâ€”meaning wrongdoers deserve to be punished because they've done something wrong. It's more about justice and less about deterrence or rehabilitation.

The question is asking which option the retributive theory does NOT claim. So I need to go through each option and see which one doesn't fit with retributive ideas.

Option A: Specific punishments are justified based on the overall intrinsic value they produce. Wait, retributive theory focuses on the idea that punishment is deserved, not necessarily about the value it produces. I think utilitarianism is more about consequences and intrinsic value, like the greatest good for the greatest number. So retributive theory might not base punishment on the intrinsic value; instead, it's about the offender's actions.

Option B: Wrongdoers deserve to be punished. That sounds exactly like retribution. Retribution is all about desert, so this is something it would claim.

Option C: The punishment should fit the crime. Yes, retributive theory emphasizes that the severity of punishment should match the severity of the crime. So this is definitely a claim of retributive theory.

Option D: The punishment should be as severe as the crime. Wait a second, while C and D seem similar, D is phrased as "as severe as," which might imply a direct equivalence. Retribution does support proportionality, so I think both C and D are in line with retributive theory, but maybe D is more about equivalence, which could be a bit different. Not sure yet, might come back to this.

Option E: Wrongdoers should be punished regardless of their personal circumstances. Retribution focuses on the act, not the circumstances. So yes, retribution would say to punish based on the act, irrespective of things like the offender's background or motivations beyond the act itself. So this is a claim.

Option F: The death penalty might be morally justified in some cases of murder. Retributive theory could support this because if the crime is severe enough, like murder, the punishment (death) fits the crime. So this is something retributive theory might claim.

Wait, going back to option A. Retributive theory isn't about the intrinsic value produced by the punishment. It's more about the justice of punishing the deserving. So if someone says punishment is justified because it produces good consequences, that's more utilitarian. Retributive theory doesn't base justification on the value or consequences but on the fact that the person deserves it. So option A is not a claim of retribution.

So the question is, which does it NOT claim. So the answer should be A.
</think>

The retributive theory of punishment focuses on the idea that wrongdoers deserve punishment based on their actions, emphasizing justice and proportionality rather than the intrinsic value or consequences of punishment. Option A, which states that specific punishments are justified based on the overall intrinsic value they produce, aligns more with utilitarianism than retributive theory. Therefore, the retributive theory does not claim this.

Answer: A
