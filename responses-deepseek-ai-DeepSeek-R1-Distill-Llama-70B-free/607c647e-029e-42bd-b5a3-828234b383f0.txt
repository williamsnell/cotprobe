Okay, so I've got this problem here about a disk unit's bit string. Hmm, let me try to understand what it's asking. The disk uses a bit string where each bit represents whether a track is occupied or vacant. Oh right, 0 means vacant and 1 means occupied. Got it.

The question gives a 32-bit segment with a hexadecimal value D4FE2003. I need to find the percentage of occupied tracks, which means I need to count how many 1s are in that 32-bit string and then calculate the percentage.

Wait, hexadecimal to binary conversion, right? Each hex digit is four bits. So the 32-bit segment is made up of 8 hex digits (since 4 bits each, 8*4=32). So I'll need to convert each hex digit to its 4-bit binary equivalent.

Let me write down each hex digit and convert them:

D, 4, F, E, 2, 0, 0, 3.

Starting with D: I remember that D in hex is 13 in decimal. So 13 in binary is 1101.

Wait no, wait. Wait, each hex digit is 4 bits. So D is 1101, yes.

4 is 0100.

F is 1111.

E is 1110.

2 is 0010.

0 is 0000.

Another 0 is 0000.

3 is 0011.

Let me list them all:

D: 1101

4: 0100

F: 1111

E: 1110

2: 0010

0: 0000

0: 0000

3: 0011

Now I need to write the entire 32-bit string by concatenating these. Let's see:

1101 0100 1111 1110 0010 0000 0000 0011.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, each hex digit is four bits, so the order is correct as is. Now, let's split each into their bits:

D: 1 1 0 1

4:0 1 0 0

F:1 1 1 1

E:1 1 1 0

2:0 0 1 0

0:0 0 0 0

0:0 0 0 0

3:0 0 1 1

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the way the bits are stored: when you convert each hex digit to four bits, the bits are ordered from the highest to the lowest. So each hex digit becomes a nibble, like D is 1101, which is 12 in decimal.

So the entire 32-bit string is the concatenation of each nibble: D is first, then 4, then F, etc. So the full binary string is:

1101 0100 1111 1110 0010 0000 0000 0011.

Wait, but when I write this out, the first nibble D is 1101, so the first four bits are 1,1,0,1. Then 4 is 0100, so next four bits 0,1,0,0, and so on.

So the entire 32 bits are:

1 1 0 1 | 0 1 0 0 | 1 1 1 1 | 1 1 1 0 | 0 0 1 0 | 0 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 0 | 0 0 1 1.

Now I need to count the number of 1s in all these bits.

Let me go through each nibble and count.

First nibble: 1 1 0 1. That's three 1s.

Second nibble: 0 1 0 0. Just one 1.

Third nibble: 1 1 1 1. Four 1s here.

Fourth nibble: 1 1 1 0. Three 1s.

Fifth nibble: 0 0 1 0. One 1.

Sixth nibble: 0 0 0 0. Zero.

Seventh nibble: 0 0 0 0. Zero.

Eighth nibble: 0 0 1 1. Two 1s.

Now adding them all up:

3 + 1 = 4.

4 + 4 = 8.

8 + 3 = 11.

11 + 1 = 12.

12 + 0 = 12.

12 + 0 = 12.

12 + 2 =14.

Wait, wait, let me recount each nibble.

First nibble (D): 1,1,0,1 → three 1s.

Second (4): 0,1,0,0 → one.

Third (F): four.

Fourth (E): three.

Fifth (2): one.

Sixth (0): zero.

Seventh (0): zero.

Eighth (3): two.

So 3+1=4, +4=8, +3=11, +1=12, then 0s, then +2=14.

Wait, that's 14 ones in total.

Wait, 32 bits, 14 are 1s. So the percentage is (14/32)*100.

14 divided by 32 is 0.4375, which is 43.75%. Rounded to the nearest percent is 44%.

Looking at the options, option G is 44%. So the answer should be G.

To determine the percentage of occupied tracks, we start with the hexadecimal value **D4FE2003**, which represents a 32-bit string. Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to 4 bits, so we convert each digit to its binary equivalent:

- **D** → **1101**  
- **4** → **0100**  
- **F** → **1111**  
- **E** → **1110**  
- **2** → **0010**  
- **0** → **0000**  
- **0** → **0000**  
- **3** → **0011**  

Concatenating these, the full 32-bit binary string is:  
**1101 0100 1111 1110 0010 0000 0000 0011**.

Next, we count the number of **1s** in the binary string:  
- **1101**: 3 ones  
- **0100**: 1 one  
- **1111**: 4 ones  
- **1110**: 3 ones  
- **0010**: 1 one  
- **0000**: 0 ones  
- **0000**: 0 ones  
- **0011**: 2 ones  

Adding these, the total number of **1s** is:  
**3 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 14**.

Since the total number of bits is 32, the percentage of occupied tracks is:  
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{14}{32}\right) \times 100 = 43.75\%.
\]

Rounding to the nearest percent, the result is **44%**. From the given options, the correct answer is **G**.

**Answer: G**
