Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find a sequence y[n] that satisfies a given recurrence relation. The equation is y[n] - (5/6)y[n-1] + (1/6)y[n-2] = 2. The initial conditions are y[-1] = 1 and y[-2] = -7. Hmm, I remember that for linear recurrence relations like this, the solution is composed of two parts: the homogeneous solution and the particular (or steady-state) solution.

Wait, right. The general approach is to solve the homogeneous equation first and then find a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous part. So the overall solution is the sum of these two.

Let me write down the homogeneous equation. That's when the right-hand side is zero. So it would be y[n] - (5/6)y[n-1] + (1/6)y[n-2] = 0. To solve this, I need the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for a recurrence relation like this is obtained by assuming a solution of the form r^n. Substituting that in, I get r^n - (5/6)r^{n-1} + (1/6)r^{n-2} = 0. Dividing both sides by r^{n-2} to simplify, I get r^2 - (5/6)r + (1/6) = 0.

Now I need to solve this quadratic equation for r. Using the quadratic formula: r = [ (5/6) ± sqrt( (5/6)^2 - 4*(1)*(1/6) ) ]/(2*1). Let me compute the discriminant first. (5/6)^2 is 25/36. The product 4*(1/6) is 4/6, which is 2/3, or 24/36. So the discriminant is 25/36 - 24/36 = 1/36. The square root of that is 1/6. So the roots are [5/6 ± 1/6 ] / 2.

Calculating the two roots:

First root: (5/6 + 1/6) = 6/6 = 1. Divide by 2? Wait, no, the quadratic formula is [ (5/6) ± (1/6) ] / 2. So, for the plus case: (5/6 + 1/6) = 6/6 = 1. Then 1 divided by 2 is 1/2. Wait, no: wait, the denominator in the quadratic formula is 2a, which here is 2*1=2. So for the plus case, (5/6 + 1/6) is 1, so 1 / 2 = 1/2. For the minus case, (5/6 -1/6)=4/6=2/3. Then 2/3 divided by 2 is (2/3)/2 = 1/3. So the two roots are r1 = 1/2 and r2 = 1/3.

So the homogeneous solution y_h[n] is a combination of these roots: y_h[n] = A*(1/2)^n + B*(1/3)^n, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.

Next, I need the particular solution y_p[n] for the nonhomogeneous equation. The nonhomogeneous term here is 2, a constant. So I can try a constant particular solution. Let's assume y_p[n] = C, where C is a constant. Plugging into the recurrence relation:

C - (5/6)C + (1/6)C = 2.

Let me compute the left side: C*(1 -5/6 +1/6) = C*( [6/6 -5/6 +1/6] ) = C*( (6-5+1)/6 ) = C*(2/6) = C*(1/3).

So 1/3 C = 2 → C = 6.

So the particular solution is y_p[n] = 6.

Therefore, the general solution is y[n] = y_p[n] + y_h[n] = 6 + A*(1/2)^n + B*(1/3)^n.

Now I need to apply the initial conditions to find A and B. Wait, the initial conditions are given at n=-1 and n=-2. Hmm, that's a bit tricky because the exponents are negative. Let me think about how to handle that.

Wait, y[-1] = 1. So substituting n=-1 into the general solution:

1 = 6 + A*(1/2)^(-1) + B*(1/3)^(-1).

Similarly, for n=-2: y[-2] = -7 → -7 = 6 + A*(1/2)^(-2) + B*(1/3)^(-2).

Let me compute these terms:

(1/2)^(-1) is 2, and (1/3)^(-1) is 3.

So for n=-1:

1 = 6 + A*(2) + B*(3) → equation 1: 2A +3B = 1-6 = -5.

For n=-2:

(1/2)^(-2) is 4, (1/3)^(-2) is 9.

So equation 2: 4A +9B = -7 -6 = -13.

Now I have a system of two equations:

2A +3B = -5 → equation 1.

4A +9B = -13 → equation 2.

Let me solve this system. I can use substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination.

Multiply equation 1 by 2: 4A +6B = -10 → equation 3.

Subtract equation 3 from equation 2:

(4A +9B) - (4A +6B) = (-13) - (-10).

→ 3B = -3 → B = -1.

Now substitute B = -1 into equation 1:

2A +3*(-1) = -5 → 2A -3 = -5 → 2A = -2 → A= -1.

So A = -1 and B = -1.

So the general solution becomes y[n] =6 + (-1)(1/2)^n + (-1)(1/3)^n.

Which simplifies to y[n] =6 - (1/2)^n - (1/3)^n.

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that: 6 - (1/2)^n - (1/3)^n.

So the answer should be B.

To solve the given recurrence relation:

\[
y[n] - \frac{5}{6}y[n-1] + \frac{1}{6}y[n-2] = 2,
\]
with initial conditions \( y[-1] = 1 \) and \( y[-2] = -7 \), we proceed as follows:

### 1. Homogeneous Solution
The homogeneous equation is:
\[
y[n] - \frac{5}{6}y[n-1] + \frac{1}{6}y[n-2] = 0.
\]
Assuming a solution of the form \( r^n \), the characteristic equation becomes:
\[
r^2 - \frac{5}{6}r + \frac{1}{6} = 0.
\]
Using the quadratic formula:
\[
r = \frac{\frac{5}{6} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1}{6}}}{2},
\]
the discriminant is:
\[
\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 - 4 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{25}{36} - \frac{24}{36} = \frac{1}{36}.
\]
Thus, the roots are:
\[
r = \frac{\frac{5}{6} \pm \frac{1}{6}}{2}, \quad r_1 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad r_2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
The homogeneous solution is:
\[
y_h[n] = A \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n + B \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n,
\]
where \( A \) and \( B \) are constants.

### 2. Particular Solution
For the nonhomogeneous term \( 2 \), we assume a constant particular solution \( y_p[n] = C \). Substituting into the recurrence relation:
\[
C - \frac{5}{6}C + \frac{1}{6}C = 2,
\]
simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{3}C = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad C = 6.
\]
Thus, the particular solution is:
\[
y_p[n] = 6.
\]

### 3. General Solution
The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:
\[
y[n] = 6 + A \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n + B \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n.
\]

### 4. Applying Initial Conditions
Using \( y[-1] = 1 \):
\[
1 = 6 + A \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-1} + B \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{-1},
\]
\[
1 = 6 + 2A + 3B \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2A + 3B = -5. \tag{1}
\]
Using \( y[-2] = -7 \):
\[
-7 = 6 + A \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{-2} + B \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{-2},
\]
\[
-7 = 6 + 4A + 9B \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4A + 9B = -13. \tag{2}
\]

### 5. Solving the System of Equations
From (1): \( 2A + 3B = -5 \).  
From (2): \( 4A + 9B = -13 \).  

Multiply (1) by 2:
\[
4A + 6B = -10. \tag{3}
\]
Subtract (3) from (2):
\[
3B = -3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad B = -1.
\]
Substitute \( B = -1 \) into (1):
\[
2A + 3(-1) = -5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2A = -2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad A = -1.
\]

### 6. Final Solution
Substituting \( A = -1 \) and \( B = -1 \) into the general solution:
\[
y[n] = 6 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n - \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n.
\]

### 7. Matching with Options
The solution matches **Option B**: \( 6 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n - \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^n \).

**Answer: B**
