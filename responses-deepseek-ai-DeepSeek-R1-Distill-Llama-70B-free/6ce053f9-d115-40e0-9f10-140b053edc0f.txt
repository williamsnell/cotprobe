Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about ammonia changing from liquid to gas. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

Alright, the question says that 1 mole of ammonia at -33.33°C and 1.00 atm is converted to vapor. I need to find q, w, and ΔE. Oh wait, and they give me some data: ΔH is 589.3 BTU per pound, and the volume occupied by 1 lb of liquid is 0.02345 ft³, and gas is 18.00 ft³ per pound. 

Wait, but wait, the problem is in moles, but the data is per pound. Oh, right, I might need to convert pounds to moles. But wait, how many moles are in a pound of ammonia? Oh, ammonia's molar mass is about 17 g/mol. So a pound is 453.59 grams. So 453.59 g divided by 17 g/mol gives approximately 26.68 moles per pound. So that's a conversion factor I might need.

But wait, the question is about 1 mole. So maybe I can find the energy per mole from the given ΔH. Let's think. ΔH is given as 589.3 BTU per pound. So for 1 mole, which is 1/26.68 pounds, the q would be (589.3 BTU/lb) * (1 mole / 26.68 lb/mol) * (1 lb / 453.59 g) * (17 g / 1 mole)? Wait, no, perhaps more straightforward: since 1 lb is 26.68 moles, then per mole, ΔH is 589.3 / 26.68 BTU per mole. Let me calculate that. 589.3 divided by 26.68... Let's see, 26.68 times 22 is about 587, so maybe approximately 22 BTU per mole? But wait, I need to convert BTU to kJ because the answer options are in kJ.

Wait, 1 BTU is about 0.252 kJ. So 22 BTU is 22 * 0.252 ≈ 5.55 kJ. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see 5.55 as an option. Wait maybe I did something wrong here. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of work done and internal energy.

Wait, the problem is about converting liquid to vapor. So this is a phase change. So q is the heat absorbed, which would be the enthalpy change ΔH. But wait, ΔH is given as 589.3 BTU per lb, so for 1 mole, it would be 589.3 / 26.68 moles per lb. Wait, no, wait, 1 mole is 1/26.68 lb. So the heat q would be (589.3 BTU/lb) * (1/26.68 lb) = approx 22 BTU. Then to kJ: 22 * 0.252 ≈ 5.55 kJ. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the expansion work. Because when a liquid turns into gas, it expands, so the system does work on the surroundings. So work done by the system is positive. So for an ideal gas, work w is PΔV, but since it's a phase change, perhaps we can use ΔV times P.

Wait, but the data given is volumes per pound. So 1 lb of liquid is 0.02345 ft³, and gas is 18 ft³. So the change in volume ΔV would be 18 - 0.02345 = about 17.97655 ft³ per lb. Since 1 lb is 26.68 moles, then per mole, ΔV is 17.97655 /26.68 ≈ 0.673 ft³ per mole. But wait, 1 ft³ is about 0.0283168 m³, so 0.673 ft³ is 0.673 * 0.0283168 ≈ 0.019 m³ per mole. Wait, but what's the pressure? It's at 1 atm, which is 101325 Pascals. 

So work done w is P_ext * ΔV. So w = 101325 Pa * 0.019 m³. Pa·m³ is equivalent to joules. So 101325 * 0.019 ≈ 1926.475 J, which is about 1.926 kJ. Since the system is expanding, work done by the system is positive, but in thermodynamics, work done by the system is positive, so w is positive. Wait, but wait, the formula is w = -PΔV when the system does work. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, I might be getting confused. Let me think carefully.

In physics, work done by the system is positive. So when the system expands (ΔV positive), it's doing work on the surroundings, so w is positive. But in the sign convention used in thermodynamics, work done by the system is considered positive. So, for expansion, w is positive. So in this case, w would be positive. But wait, wait. The formula is w = -P_ext ΔV. So if ΔV is positive (expansion), then w is negative. Hmm, no, that's not right. Wait, maybe I should get this straight.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The first law is ΔE = q + w, where w is work done on the system. If the system does work, then w is negative. Alternatively, some conventions have w as work done by the system, so it's positive when system does work. I think in the standard convention, q is positive when heat is added to the system, and w is positive when work is done by the system. So in this case, since the system is expanding, work is done by the system, so w is positive.

Wait, but another approach: for expansion, the system is doing work, so from the system's point of view, it's losing energy, so work is positive. So in that case, w would be positive. So in this problem, when the system goes from liquid to gas, it's expanding, so work is positive.

So, back to the calculation. So the work done by the system (w) would be P ΔV. But wait, P is 1 atm, which is 101325 Pa. ΔV per mole is 0.019 m³ as I calculated. So w = P * ΔV = 101325 * 0.019 ≈ 1926 J, which is 1.926 kJ. So approximately 1.94 kJ. So w = +1.94 kJ.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that it's 1 mole. So the volume change is (18.00 - 0.02345) ft³ per lb, but per mole, that's (17.97655 ft³ per lb) / 26.68 moles per lb) = 0.673 ft³ per mole. Oh wait, I think I miscalculated earlier. Let me recalculate that.

Wait, 1 lb is 26.68 moles. So 1 mole is 1/26.68 lb. So the volume change per mole is (18.00 - 0.02345) ft³/lb * (1 lb / 26.68 moles) = (17.97655 / 26.68) ft³/mole ≈ 0.673 ft³/mole. Then convert that to m³: 0.673 ft³ * (0.0283168 m³/ft³) ≈ 0.01905 m³.

Then, P is 1 atm = 101325 Pa, so w = P ΔV = 101325 * 0.01905 ≈ 1930 J ≈ 1.93 kJ. So approximately 1.94 kJ. So w is positive, since the system is doing work.

Wait, but wait, in the first law, the formula is ΔE = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. So if the system does work, w is negative. Or is it that w is the work done by the system? This is a point where I tend to get confused. Let me clarify.

In physics, the first law is often written as ΔE = q - PΔV, where PΔV is the work done by the system. So in that case, if the system does work, ΔE decreases, so w (as work done by system) is positive, and thus subtracted. Alternatively, sometimes w is defined as work done on the system, so in that case, when the system does work, w is negative.

In the context of this problem, I think the convention is that work done by the system is positive. So when the system expands, doing work, w is positive. So in our case, w is positive 1.94 kJ.

Wait, but some sources say that in the first law, ΔE equals q plus w, where w is work done on the system. So if the system does work, w is negative. So in that case, if the system does +1.94 kJ, then w is -1.94 kJ. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula. The work done BY the system is w = PΔV. So if the system is expanding, ΔV is positive, so w is positive. So if the formula is ΔE = q - w (where w is work done by the system), then ΔE = q - w. Alternatively, if ΔE = q + w, where w is work done on the system, then w would be negative when the system does work.

Wait, in some textbooks, the first law is written as ΔE = q + w, where w is the work done on the system. So when the system does work on the surroundings (expansion), w is negative. So in our case, since the system is expanding, w = -1.94 kJ.

Wait, this is a crucial point. Let me get this straight. Let me imagine:

Case 1: The system does work on the surroundings (like expanding). Then, the work done by the system is positive, and the work done on the system is negative. So if the formula is ΔE = q + w, where w is work done on the system, then w would be negative in this case.

So in our problem, since the system is expanding, the work done on the system is negative, so w is -1.94 kJ.

Alternatively, if the formula is written as ΔE = q - PΔV, then PΔV is the work done by the system, so if the system does work, it's subtracted. So in that case, w would be positive 1.94 kJ, but in the formula, it's subtracted.

Wait, I'm getting myself tied up here. Let me try to find a way to proceed.

Let me think about the process: converting liquid to gas at constant pressure (1 atm), so it's a constant pressure process. So, for a constant pressure process, the heat q is equal to ΔH, because ΔH = q_p. So that's a key point. So q = ΔH.

So, for 1 mole, q would be the molar enthalpy change. So I need to find the molar ΔH.

Wait, ΔH is given as 589.3 BTU per lb. So per mole, it's 589.3 / 26.68 lb/mol. Let me compute that.

589.3 / 26.68 ≈ let's see, 26.68 * 22 = 587. So approximately 22 BTU per mole. Now, converting BTU to kJ: 1 BTU ≈ 0.252 kJ, so 22 * 0.252 ≈ 5.55 kJ. So q ≈ 5.55 kJ per mole. But looking at the options, none of them have q as 5.55. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the given ΔH is for vaporization. So when the liquid turns into gas, it's absorbing heat. So q would be positive and equal to ΔH. So 5.55 kJ per mole. But none of the options have that. The options have values around 1.94, 21.39, etc. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the per mole value.

Wait, wait a second. Let's recalculate the per mole ΔH correctly. 

ΔH is given as 589.3 BTU per pound. 

Molar mass of NH3 is 17.031 g/mol. So pounds per mole: 17.031 g/mol * (1 lb / 453.592 g) = approx 0.03746 lb/mol. So 1 mole is 0.03746 lb. So per mole, ΔH is 589.3 BTU/lb * 0.03746 lb/mol. Let me compute that: 589.3 * 0.03746 ≈ 22.08 BTU/mol. So 22.08 BTU/mol. 

Convert to kJ: 22.08 BTU * 0.252 kJ/BTU ≈ 5.56 kJ/mol. So q = +5.56 kJ. Hmm, but none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses the volume data for calculating the work done, not the enthalpy. Wait, but the problem does give ΔH, so perhaps it's using that for q.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the first law: ΔE = q + w. Or is it q - w? 

Wait, let me write down all the variables:

q is the heat absorbed by the system (positive since it's endothermic), w is the work done by the system (positive as it's expanding), and ΔE is the change in internal energy.

So, q = ΔH = 5.56 kJ (but again, none of the options have this value, so perhaps I'm wrong). Wait, but maybe the calculation is per mole, but the given ΔH is not per mole but per pound. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the work using the volume change, and then find ΔE as q - w or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not using ΔH as q, but calculating q from the work done. Wait, that might not make sense. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is at constant pressure, so q_p = ΔH. So q = ΔH. So for 1 mole, q = 5.56 kJ. Then, the work done is PΔV. So if the system expands, w is positive (as work done by the system). So the first law is ΔE = q - w. So ΔE = 5.56 kJ - 1.94 kJ ≈ 3.62 kJ. But none of the options match this. So I'm getting stuck.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see: option B has q = 21.39, w=23.33, ΔE = -1.94. Option D has q=1.94, w=-21.39, ΔE=23.33. Option E has q=23.33, w=1.94, ΔE=21.39. Option H has q=21.39, w=1.94, ΔE=23.33. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the work done using the ideal gas law, assuming the gas occupies a certain volume. But wait, the problem gives the volume per pound, so maybe I should calculate the volume change for 1 mole.

Wait, 1 lb of liquid is 0.02345 ft³, and 1 lb of gas is 18.00 ft³. So per mole, it's (18.00 - 0.02345) ft³ per lb * (1 lb / 26.68 moles) = (17.97655 / 26.68) ≈ 0.673 ft³ per mole. So ΔV = 0.673 ft³ per mole. 

Converting to m³: 1 ft³ = 0.0283168 m³, so 0.673 * 0.0283168 ≈ 0.01905 m³. 

Then, work done at 1 atm (101325 Pa) is PΔV = 101325 * 0.01905 ≈ 1930 J ≈ 1.93 kJ, which I can round to 1.94 kJ. So w = 1.94 kJ.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if the system does work, w is positive. So if the formula is ΔE = q - w, then ΔE = q - 1.94.

But wait, if q is the heat absorbed, which is ΔH, then q would be positive. So let's say q = ΔH = 5.56 kJ as calculated before. Then ΔE = 5.56 - 1.94 ≈ 3.62 kJ. But none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Alternatively, perhaps ΔH is not equal to q here. Wait, no, because it's at constant pressure, so q_p = ΔH. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the per mole ΔH. Let me recalculate that.

ΔH in BTU per pound is 589.3. So per mole, it's 589.3 * (1 mole / 26.68 lb). So 589.3 / 26.68 ≈ 22.08 BTU per mole. Yes, that's correct. Converting to kJ: 22.08 * 0.252 ≈ 5.56 kJ.

Hmm. So if q is 5.56 kJ, w is 1.94 kJ, then ΔE is 5.56 - 1.94 = 3.62 kJ. But none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the work done in the expansion against a constant external pressure, but not using the ideal gas law. So using the given volumes, which might be more accurate.

Wait, the problem states that 1 lb of liquid occupies 0.02345 ft³, and 1 lb of gas occupies 18.00 ft³. So for 1 mole, which is 1/26.68 lb, the volume change would be (18.00 - 0.02345) * (1/26.68) = 17.97655 / 26.68 ≈ 0.673 ft³, as before.

So work done is PΔV = 1 atm * 0.673 ft³. But I need to convert 0.673 ft³
