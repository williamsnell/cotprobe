Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking which of the given compounds does not contain oxygen. The options are A through G, each representing a different type of organic compound. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll list out all the options:

A: An alcohol
B: An ether
C: An amide
D: An aldehyde
E: An alkane
F: A ketone
G: An ester

I remember that each of these functional groups has specific characteristics, especially regarding the elements they contain. So, my goal is to determine which one doesn't have oxygen.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Starting with option A, an alcohol. I know that alcohols have the -OH group. So that's definitely oxygen present because OH has an oxygen atom. So A contains oxygen.

Option B is an ether. Ethers have an oxygen atom in their structure, connecting two carbon groups. The general formula is R-O-R', so oxygen is definitely there. So B contains oxygen.

Option C is an amide. Amides have a structure where a carbonyl group (C=O) is attached to a nitrogen. The formula is usually RCONR2. So that has oxygen in the carbonyl group. So C contains oxygen.

Option D is an aldehyde. Aldehydes have a carbonyl group at the end of a carbon chain, with the structure RCHO. The carbonyl is C=O, so oxygen is present here. So D contains oxygen.

Option E is an alkane. Wait, alkanes are hydrocarbons, right? They're made up of only carbon and hydrogen. Their general formula is CnH2n+2. So no oxygen in alkanes. So E does not contain oxygen.

But wait, I should check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option F is a ketone. Ketones have a carbonyl group in the middle of the carbon chain, structure RCOR'. The carbonyl has oxygen, so F contains oxygen.

Option G is an ester. Esters have the structure RCOOR', which includes an oxygen in the carbonyl and another in the ether part. So definitely oxygen here. So G contains oxygen.

So from this analysis, the only compound without oxygen is option E, the alkane. All others have oxygen in their functional groups.

To determine which compound does not contain oxygen, we analyze the functional groups of each option:

- **A: An alcohol** contains the -OH group, which includes oxygen.  
- **B: An ether** has an oxygen atom connecting two carbon groups (R-O-R').  
- **C: An amide** contains a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to nitrogen.  
- **D: An aldehyde** has a carbonyl group (C=O) at the end of a carbon chain.  
- **E: An alkane** is a hydrocarbon with only carbon and hydrogen atoms (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂), containing no oxygen.  
- **F: A ketone** has a carbonyl group (C=O) in the middle of a carbon chain.  
- **G: An ester** contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and an oxygen atom in the ether part (RCOOR').  

The only compound without oxygen is **E: An alkane**.  

Answer: E
