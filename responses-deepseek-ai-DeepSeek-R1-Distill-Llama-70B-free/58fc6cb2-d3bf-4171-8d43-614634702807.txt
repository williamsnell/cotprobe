Question:

Differentiate tariffs from quotas as barriers to free trade.

Options:

A: Tariffs and quotas both set a maximum limit on imports
B: Tariffs are regulatory fees on exports, while quotas are subsidies for imported goods
C: Tariffs limit the quantity of goods, and quotas impose taxes on imports
D: Quotas are taxes on goods, and tariffs limit the quantity of imports
E: Tariffs are preferential trade agreements between countries, while quotas are unilateral restrictions imposed by one country on another's exports
F: Quotas require domestic producers to limit production, while tariffs are used to standardize the price of imports and exports
G: Quotas are fixed fees on the volume of imports, and tariffs are percentage-based restrictions on the quantity of imports
H: Tariffs are used to ban specific goods from being imported, while quotas require a special license to import more than a certain amount
I: Tariffs are taxes on imported goods to raise revenue and protect domestic industries, while quotas set a maximum on the quantity of a good that may be imported during a given time period.
J: Quotas increase the price of domestic goods, while tariffs restrict the amount of goods leaving the country

Okay, so I have this question about differentiating between tariffs and quotas as barriers to free trade. Hmm, I remember that both are types of trade barriers, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact differences. Let me think this through.

Tariffs, I think, are taxes or fees imposed on imported goods. They make the imported goods more expensive, which can protect domestic industries because consumers might choose the cheaper domestic products instead. So tariffs are like a financial barrier.

Quotas, on the other hand, are quantitative restrictions. They set a limit on the number of goods that can be imported. Like, a government might say only X amount of a certain product can come into the country each year. This directly limits the supply of imported goods, which can drive up their prices because of scarcity, but it's more about controlling the quantity.

Wait, so looking at the options. Option I says that tariffs are taxes on imported goods to raise revenue and protect industries, while quotas set a maximum quantity. That sounds right. Let me check other options to be sure.

Option A says both set a maximum limit. No, because tariffs are about taxes, not quantity limits. So A is wrong.

Option B: Tariffs on exports? Wait, no, tariffs are usually on imports, not exports. Exports might have other taxes sometimes, but generally tariffs are on imports. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Tariffs limit quantity, quotas impose taxes. No, that's the opposite. Tariffs are taxes, quotas limit quantity. So C is wrong.

Option D: Quotas are taxes? No, D says that, which is incorrect. Tariffs are the taxes.

Option E: Tariffs are preferential trade agreements? No, that's more like what free trade agreements are. Tariffs are taxes. So E is wrong.

Option F: Quotas make domestic producers limit production? I don't think so. Quotas are about imports, not domestic production limits. F seems incorrect.

Option G: Quotas as fixed fees on imports, tariffs as percentage-based. Wait, no, tariffs are usually a percentage (like a certain percentage of the value of the goods). Quotas are about quantity limits, not fees. So G is mixing things up.

Option H: Tariffs ban specific goods? No, that's more like an embargo. Tariffs just tax them. Quotas require licenses beyond a certain amount. Maybe that's correct, but I'm not sure. Wait, quotas are about quantity limits, which could involve issuing import licenses up to that limit. So H might be right, but I thought I was correct earlier.

Wait, let me read H again. "Tariffs are used to ban specific goods..." No, that's not right. Tariffs don't ban, they just tax. Bans are different. So H is wrong.

Option I: Tariffs are taxes on imports for revenue and protection; quotas set maximum quantity. Yes, that's what I thought earlier.

Option J: Quotas increase domestic prices, tariffs restrict exports. No, tariffs are on imports, not exports. J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be I.

The correct answer is I.

I: Tariffs are taxes on imported goods to raise revenue and protect domestic industries, while quotas set a maximum on the quantity of a good that may be imported during a given time period.

Answer: I
