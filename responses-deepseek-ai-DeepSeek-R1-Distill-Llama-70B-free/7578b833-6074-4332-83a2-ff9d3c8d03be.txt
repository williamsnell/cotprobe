Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about estimating the number of collisions of air molecules per second with the surface of an average human being. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

Alright, the question gives me some data. The air is 20 mole percent O2 and 80 mole percent N2, but I'm not sure if the composition matters here. Maybe it's a red herring because the question is about air in general, not a specific gas. Oh wait, but for calculations, we might need the average molar mass or something. Hmm.

The total external surface area is 2.0 m². Oh wait, but wait, the options have some in cm, so I might have to convert that. 2 m² is 2 * (100 cm)^2 = 2 * 10^4 cm² = 2e4 cm².

The problem asks for the number of collisions per second. I remember that the formula for the rate of collisions is related to the pressure, or maybe using the kinetic theory of gases. Oh right, the root mean square velocity and the collision frequency.

Wait, the formula I think is: the number of collisions per second per unit area is (P * N_A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R T)) ) or something like that. Wait, let me think again. Oh, right! The flux (Φ) of gas molecules is given by Φ = (P N_A) / (sqrt(2 π M (R T)}), but wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula.

Alternatively, I remember that the number of collisions per second per unit area (Z) is given by (P N_A) / (sqrt(2 π M R T)) ). Or perhaps it's something like Z = (P) * (N_A) * (sqrt(R T / (2 π M))) ) / (k_B T) ? No, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me recall: the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution gives the average speed, and the flux is (1/4) n v_avg, where n is the number density.

Wait, number density n is (P N_A) / (R T), because P V = n R T, so n = P/(R T) * N_A. Right, because n is moles per volume, so multiplied by Avogadro's number gives molecules per volume.

Then the average speed v_avg is sqrt(8 R T / (π M)) ), where M is the molar mass. So the flux Φ is (1/4) n v_avg. So Φ = (1/4) * (P N_A)/(R T) ) * sqrt(8 R T/(π M)).

So putting it all together: Φ = (P N_A) / (4 R T) ) * sqrt(8 R T/(π M)).

Simplifying that, let's see. Let me square the terms. Wait, let's compute step by step.

Alternatively, maybe an easier approach is to use the formula for the collision rate. The number of collisions per second per unit area is (P) * (N_A) / (sqrt(2 π M R T)}.

Wait, I think I saw somewhere that the number of collisions per second (Z) is equal to (P * N_A) / (sqrt(2 π M R T)) ) * (1 / (k_B T)) )? Or am I mixing up concepts here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the rate of effusion, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the formula correctly.

Another approach: The flux Φ is the number of molecules striking a surface per unit area per unit time. So Φ = (1/4) * n * v_avg.

n is the number density, which is (P N_A) / (R T).

v_avg is the average speed, which is sqrt(8 R T / (π M)).

So substituting:

Φ = (1/4) * (P N_A)/(R T) ) * sqrt(8 R T/(π M)).

Let me compute that:

Let me compute each part:

n = P N_A / (R T).

v_avg = sqrt(8 R T / (π M)).

Then Φ = (1/4) * (P N_A)/(R T) * sqrt(8 R T/(π M)).

Simplify this:

Let me write it as (P N_A) / (4 R T) ) * sqrt(8 R T/(π M)).

Let me square the terms under the square root. Hmm, square root of (8 R T / (π M)) is sqrt(8/(π M)) * sqrt(R T).

So, the expression becomes (P N_A) / (4 R T) ) * sqrt(8/(π M)) * sqrt(R T).

Hmm, sqrt(R T) is (R T)^1/2.

So when I combine terms, I have (R T)^(-1) * (R T)^(1/2) ) = (R T)^(-1 + 1/2) ) = (R T)^(-1/2) ) = 1/(sqrt(R T)).

So putting it all together:

Φ = (P N_A) * sqrt(8/(π M)) ) / (4) ) * 1/(sqrt(R T)).

Wait, let me compute this more carefully.

Wait,  sqrt(8 R T/(π M)) ) is sqrt(8/(π M)) ) * sqrt(R T).

So the expression is:

Φ = [ (P N_A) / (4 R T) ) ] * [ sqrt(8/(π M)) ) * sqrt(R T) ) ]

The R T in the denominator is R T, and the sqrt(R T) is (R T)^(1/2). So (1/(R T)) * (R T)^(1/2) ) = (R T)^(-1 + 1/2) ) = (R T)^(-1/2) ) = 1/(sqrt(R T)).

So Φ becomes:

Φ = [ P N_A / (4) ] * [ sqrt(8/(π M)) ) ] * [ 1/(sqrt(R T)) ) ]

So Φ = (P N_A /4 ) * sqrt(8/(π M)) ) * 1/sqrt(R T) )

Let me simplify the constants. sqrt(8/π) is a constant. sqrt(8)=2*sqrt(2), so that's 2√2/√π.

So sqrt(8/(π M)) ) = 2√(2/(π M)).

So putting it all together:

Φ = (P N_A /4 ) * (2√(2/(π M)) ) * 1/sqrt(R T) )

The 4 and 2 can be simplified: 2/4 = 1/2.

So Φ = P N_A * (1/2) * sqrt(2/(π M)) ) / sqrt(R T) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute numerically.

Let me plug in the numbers.

Given:

P = 1 atm. I need to convert that to Pascals. 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

T = 25°C = 298 K.

R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/(mol·K).

M is the molar mass of air. Air is approximately 78% N2 (28 g/mol) and 21% O2 (32 g/mol). So M ≈ 0.78*28 + 0.21*32 = let's compute: 0.78*28=21.84, 0.21*32=6.72, total 21.84+6.72=28.56 g/mol. So M = 0.02856 kg/mol (since 1 g = 0.001 kg).

N_A is Avogadro's number, 6.022e23 mol^-1.

Surface area A = 2.0 m² = 2e4 dm² = 2e4 * (10^2 cm)^2? Wait, no, 1 m² is (100 cm)^2 = 1e4 cm². So 2 m² = 2e4 *1e4 cm²? Wait, no. 1 m² = (100 cm)^2 = 10^4 cm². So 2 m² is 2 * 1e4 cm² = 2e4 cm².

Wait wait, 1 m is 100 cm, so 1 m² is (100 cm)^2 = 10000 cm². So 2 m² is 20000 cm², which is 2e4 cm².

So now, let's compute Φ in molecules per cm² per second.

Wait, but let's first compute Φ in molecules per m² per second, then convert to per cm².

But perhaps I should compute the total collisions per second, which would be Φ (per m² s) multiplied by the surface area in m². Alternatively, compute Φ per cm² and then multiply by the area in cm².

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute Φ in per second per cm², then multiply by 2e4 cm² to get total collisions per second.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total collisions per second as P * N_A * ... times the area.

Wait, let me proceed step by step.

Compute Φ = (1/4) * n * v_avg.

n = P N_A / (R T) = (101325 Pa) * 6.022e23 / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K).

Let me compute that. Let me compute denominator first: 8.314 *298 ≈ 2477.772 ≈ 2.478e3.

So n = (101325 *6.022e23) / 2.478e3.

Compute numerator: 101325 *6.022e23 = approx 1.01325e5 *6.022e23 = approx 6.103e28.

Divide by 2.478e3: 6.103e28 / 2.478e3 ≈ 2.463e25 molecules/m³.

Wait, because n is in molecules per m³.

Then, the average speed v_avg = sqrt(8 R T / (π M)).

M is 0.02856 kg/mol. R is 8.314 J/mol K.

So R T = 8.314 * 298 ≈ 2477.772 J/mol.

So 8 R T = 8 * 2477.772 ≈ 19822.176 J/mol.

Divide by π M: 19822.176 / (π * 0.02856) ≈ let's compute denominator: π *0.02856 ≈ 0.08966.

So 19822.176 / 0.08966 ≈ approx 221,133.

Then take square root: sqrt(221133) ≈ 470.4 m/s.

So v_avg ≈ 470.4 m/s.

So Φ = (1/4) * n * v_avg = 0.25 * 2.463e25 * 470.4.

Compute 2.463e25 * 470.4 = approx 1.16e28.

Multiply by 0.25: 2.9e27 molecules/(m² s).

Wait, Φ is per m², so per second per m². So the total collisions per second would be Φ * A, where A is 2 m².

So 2.9e27 * 2 = 5.8e27 collisions per second.

Looking at the options, option I is 5.77e27, which is close. But wait, wait, my calculation is rough. Maybe I made some approximation errors.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Let me redo the calculations with more precise numbers.

Compute n:

n = (P N_A) / (R T) = (101325 * 6.022e23) / (8.314 * 298).

Compute numerator: 101325 *6.022e23 = 101325 *6.022e23 = let me compute 101325 *6.022 = approx 610,000. So 610,000e23 = 6.1e28.

Denominator: 8.314 *298 = let's compute 8 * 298 = 2384, 0.314*298 ≈ 93.772 → total 2477.772.

So n = 6.1e28 / 2477.772 ≈ 2.463e25 molecules/m³.

v_avg = sqrt(8 R T / (π M)).

Compute 8 R T: 8 *8.314 *298 = 8 * (8.314 *298) → 8.314 *298 ≈ 2477.772 → 8 *2477.772≈19822.176.

Divide by π M: 19822.176 / (π *0.02856) → π is 3.1416, so 3.1416 *0.02856 ≈ 0.08966.

19822.176 / 0.08966 ≈ let's compute:

0.08966 → approx 8.966e-2.

19822.176 / 0.08966 ≈ 19822.176 / 8.966e-2 → 19822.176 * (1/8.966e-2) ) → 1/8.966e-2 ≈ 11.15.

So 19822.176 * 11.15 ≈ let's compute 20000 *11.15=223000, subtract 177.824 *11.15 ≈ 1982 → 223000-1982≈ 221018 → sqrt(221018) ≈ 470.02 m/s.

So v_avg ≈ 470 m/s.

Then Φ = (1/4)*n*v_avg = 0.25 * 2.463e25 * 470.

Compute 2.463e25 *470 = 2.463 *470 = approx 1158. So 1158e25 = 1.158e28.

Multiply by 0.25: 1.158e28 *0.25 = 2.895e27 molecules/(m² s).

So Φ ≈ 2.895e27 molecules per square meter per second.

Total collisions per second = Φ * A = 2.895e27 * 2 m² = 5.79e27 collisions/sec.

Looking at the options, option I is 5.77e27, which is very close. So the correct answer should be I.

But wait, let me double-check. I might have made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using another approach, such as using the formula Z = (P N_A) * sqrt(R T / (2 π M)) ) * A / (R T) ?

Wait, let me try another formula. I think another way is to calculate the number of collisions using the formula:

Number of collisions per second = (P * A * N_A) / (sqrt(2 π M R T)).

Wait, that might be the formula I was trying to recall earlier.

So Z = (P * A * N_A) / sqrt(2 π M R T).

Let me plug the numbers into this formula.

P = 101325 Pa.

A = 2 m².

N_A = 6.022e23.

M = 0.02856 kg/mol.

R = 8.314.

T = 298.

Compute denominator: sqrt(2 π M R T).

So 2 π M R T = 2 * 3.1416 * 0.02856 kg/mol * 8.314 J/mol K * 298 K.

Compute each part:

2 *3.1416 ≈6.2832.

0.02856 kg/mol.

8.314 J/mol K.

298 K.

Multiply all together:

6.2832 * 0.02856 ≈ 0.1794.

0.1794 *8.314 ≈ 1.491.

1.491 *298 ≈ 444.2.

So sqrt(444.2) ≈ 21.07.

So denominator is approx 21.07.

Now numerator: P * A * N_A = 101325 * 2 * 6.022e23.

Compute 101325 *2 = 202650.

202650 *6.022e23 ≈ (2.0265e5) *6.022e23 = 1.220e29.

So Z = 1.220e29 /21.07 ≈ approx 5.78e27.

Which matches what I got before, so around 5.77e27 collisions per second. So option I is correct.

To estimate the number of collisions of air molecules per second with the surface of an average human being, we use the kinetic theory of gases. The flux of gas molecules, Φ, is given by:

\[
\Phi = \frac{1}{4} \cdot n \cdot v_{\text{avg}}
\]

where \( n \) is the number density of air molecules, and \( v_{\text{avg}} \) is the average speed of the molecules. The number density \( n \) is calculated as:

\[
n = \frac{P \cdot N_A}{R \cdot T}
\]

where:
- \( P = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \) (pressure),
- \( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \) (Avogadro's number),
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \) (gas constant),
- \( T = 298 \, \text{K} \) (temperature in Kelvin).

Substituting these values:

\[
n = \frac{101325 \cdot 6.022 \times 10^{23}}{8.314 \cdot 298} \approx 2.463 \times 10^{25} \, \text{molecules/m}^3
\]

The average speed \( v_{\text{avg}} \) is given by:

\[
v_{\text{avg}} = \sqrt{\frac{8 \cdot R \cdot T}{\pi \cdot M}}
\]

where \( M = 0.02856 \, \text{kg/mol} \) is the molar mass of air. Substituting:

\[
v_{\text{avg}} = \sqrt{\frac{8 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 298}{\pi \cdot 0.02856}} \approx 470.4 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Now, calculate the flux \( \Phi \):

\[
\Phi = \frac{1}{4} \cdot n \cdot v_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2.463 \times 10^{25} \cdot 470
