Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let me try to remember what I learned in my classes. The question is about the length of a moving meter stick. Hmm, I think this has something to do with special relativity. Oh right, length contraction! When an object moves at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer, its length in the direction of motion contracts.

Alright, so the problem says the meter stick is moving lengthwise at a speed of 2.7 × 10^8 m/s. Wait, the speed of light is approximately 3 × 10^8 m/s, so 2.7e8 is 90% of the speed of light. That makes sense because I remember that at high speeds, relativistic effects become noticeable.

The proper length L0 is given as 1 meter. Proper length is the length measured in the object's rest frame. So when the stick is moving, its length L will be contracted. The formula for length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or wait, sometimes it's written as L = L0 / gamma, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So yeah, I'll calculate gamma first and then find L.

Let me plug in the numbers. v is 2.7e8 m/s, c is 3e8 m/s. So v/c is 0.9. Then v²/c² is (0.9)^2 = 0.81. So 1 - v²/c² is 0.19. The square root of 0.19 is... Hmm, sqrt(0.16) is 0.4, and sqrt(0.25) is 0.5. So sqrt(0.19) is somewhere between 0.435 and 0.436. Let me calculate it more accurately. 0.435^2 is 0.435 * 0.435. Let's see: 400 *400 is 160000, but wait that's for 4.35. Wait, no, 0.435 squared is (4.35e-1)^2 = 18.9225e-2, which is 0.189225. Oh, that's close to 0.19. So sqrt(0.19) is approximately 0.4359 or so.

So gamma is 1 / 0.4359 ≈ 2.294. Wait, wait, no: wait L is L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So L = 1 m * 0.4359 ≈ 0.436 meters.

Looking at the options, the closest value is option A: 0.24, B: 0.34, F: 0.44. Wait, 0.4359 is approximately 0.436, which is about 0.44 meters. So option F is 0.44m.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation. Because sometimes I might mix up the formula. Let me make sure I'm using the right one. The length in the direction of motion is contracted, so L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, sometimes people write it as L = L0 * sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) which is the same thing. So my calculation should be correct.

Wait another thing: when v is a significant fraction of c, like 0.9c here, the gamma factor is greater than 1, so the length should be shorter. So 0.44 meters is less than 1, which makes sense.

Let me check the options again. Option F is 0.44 m. So that's the answer.

To determine the length of a moving meter stick, we apply the concept of length contraction from special relativity. The formula for the contracted length is:

\[
L = L_0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( L_0 = 1 \, \text{m} \) (the proper length of the meter stick in its rest frame),
- \( v = 2.7 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (the speed of the stick),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (the speed of light).

First, calculate \( \frac{v}{c} \):
\[
\frac{v}{c} = \frac{2.7 \times 10^8}{3 \times 10^8} = 0.9
\]

Next, compute \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):
\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.9)^2 = 0.81
\]

Now, calculate \( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \):
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.81 = 0.19
\]

Take the square root:
\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{0.19} \approx 0.436
\]

Finally, calculate the contracted length \( L \):
\[
L = L_0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 1 \cdot 0.436 \approx 0.436 \, \text{m}
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is \( 0.44 \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option F.
