Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the heat of formation for propane using bond dissociation energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that the heat of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. For propane, the standard state of the elements would be carbon as graphite and hydrogen as H2 gas.

The question gives me the bond energies: C-C is 80 kcal/mol, C-H is 99 kcal/mol, and H-H is 103 kcal/mol. I think I need to use these to calculate the enthalpy change when propane is formed from its elements.

Wait, right. The process involves breaking bonds in the reactants and forming bonds in the products. So the heat of formation is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products. Or is it the other way around? Oh right, because when you break bonds, it takes energy (endothermic), and forming bonds releases energy (exothermic). So the heat of formation is the energy required to break the bonds minus the energy released when forming new bonds.

So the formula is ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products).

But wait, wait. Wait, the reactants are the elements in their standard states. For propane, C3H8, the reactants would be graphite (solid carbon) and H2 gas. So I need to break down how much energy is involved in forming propane from these.

Let me think about the steps. To form propane, I need to form C-C and C-H bonds. But wait, the elements are in their standard states, so the process is: take graphite and H2, break them down, and then form propane.

So in the reactants, I have C (graphite) and H2. For each molecule of propane, I need three C atoms and eight H atoms. But wait, each H2 molecule has two H atoms, so I need four H2 molecules to get eight H atoms.

The bonds that need to be broken are: in graphite, each carbon is bonded to other carbons. But wait, graphite is a solid with a network structure, so each C is bonded to three others. But I'm not sure how that translates here. Oh wait, maybe I should think about the standard way of calculating this. I think the standard approach is to consider the bond energies of the elements in their standard forms.

Wait, perhaps I should structure this as: consider the formation of propane from its elements. The reaction is: 3 C(graphite) + 4 H2(g) → C3H8(g).

But wait, wait, the heat of formation is per mole of propane. So I'm calculating the ΔHf for one mole of C3H8.

So the steps are:

1. Break the bonds in the reactants to get atoms.
2. Form the bonds in the product.

But wait, in this case, the reactants are graphite (each C is in a solid structure) and H2 gas. So the energy required is the bond energy of graphite (but I don't have that value here) and the H-H bonds in H2.

Wait a second, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Oh wait, the data given is for bond dissociation energies. So maybe I need to calculate the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants and the energy released when forming the bonds in propane.

Wait, but for the carbon, since it's in graphite form, each C is connected via C-C bonds. So to get individual C atoms, I need to break those C-C bonds. But how many bonds per mole of C? Hmm, in graphite, each carbon is bonded to three others, but each bond is shared between two carbons. So per mole of C atoms, the number of C-C bonds is 1.5 moles (since each C has three bonds, but each bond is between two Cs, so per mole C, 3/2 moles of C-C bonds). But I'm not sure if that's the right way to approach it. Alternatively, maybe each mole of C-C bonds is 80 kcal, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the standard method for calculating heats of formation using bond energies. The general approach is to calculate the heat of formation as the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (elements) minus the sum of the bond energies of the products (compound).

Wait no, wait. The heat of formation is calculated using the bond energies of the elements in their standard states. So for each molecule of propane, I'm starting from carbon (as graphite) and hydrogen (as H2), breaking their bonds and then forming the bonds in propane.

So the energy required is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (elements) multiplied by the number of bonds broken. The energy released is the sum of the bond energies of the product multiplied by the number of bonds formed.

But wait, for the elements in their standard state, like H2, each molecule has one H-H bond. So for each mole of H2, I need to break one mole of H-H bonds.

So let me outline the steps for the formation of propane:

1. Start with 3 moles of graphite (each C atom in graphite is bonded to others via C-C bonds). To get 3 moles of individual C atoms, I need to break the C-C bonds. How many C-C bonds are there in 3 moles of C atoms?

Wait, in graphite, each C is bonded to three others, but each bond is shared between two C atoms. So for 3 moles of C atoms, the number of C-C bonds is (3 * 3)/2 = 4.5 moles of C-C bonds. Because each bond is shared, so for n atoms, each with 3 bonds, the total bonds are (3n)/2.

So for 3 moles of C, that's (3*3)/2 = 4.5 moles of C-C bonds. So breaking these requires energy equal to 4.5 * 80 kcal/mol (since each C-C bond is 80 kcal/mol). So 4.5 *80 = 360 kcal.

2. Then, for the hydrogen, we have 4 moles of H2 (since propane is C3H8, so 8 H atoms, which is 4 H2 molecules). Each H2 has one H-H bond, so 4 moles of H-H bonds. The energy required to break these is 4 * 103 = 412 kcal.

So the total energy required (input) is 360 + 412 = 772 kcal.

Then, when forming propane, we form the bonds in the molecule. So for each propane molecule, how many C-C and C-H bonds are there?

Propane is CH3CH2CH3. So there are two C-C bonds and 8 C-H bonds per molecule.

Wait, wait. Let me count. Each C in propane forms bonds. The central C is connected to two other Cs and two Hs. The end Cs are each connected to one C and three Hs. So in total:

Number of C-C bonds: 2 per molecule (between C1-C2 and C2-C3).

Number of C-H bonds: Each of the three C atoms has 3, 2, and 3 H's respectively. Wait, no, each of the two end C's has 3 Hs, and the middle C has 2 Hs. So 3+2+3=8 Hs, so 8 C-H bonds.

So for each mole of propane, we form 2 moles of C-C bonds and 8 moles of C-H bonds.

So the energy released when forming these bonds is (2 *80) + (8 *99) = 160 + 792 = 952 kcal.

Wait, but wait. Because when the bonds form, energy is released. So the total energy change would be the sum of the energies required to break the reactant bonds minus the sum of the energies released when forming the product bonds.

So the total enthalpy change (ΔHf) is (energy for breaking reactants) - (energy for forming products).

Wait, no, wait. Because breaking bonds requires energy (positive), and forming bonds releases energy (negative). So the overall process is:

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies broken) - (sum of bond energies formed).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The bond dissociation energy is the energy required to break a bond. So when you break the bonds in the reactants, you're adding energy (positive). When you form the bonds in the product, you're releasing energy (negative). So the overall ΔHf is the energy required to break the reactant bonds minus the energy released when forming the product bonds.

So in formula terms:

ΔHf = (E_broken) - (E_formed).

So in our case, E_broken is 772 kcal (from breaking C-C and H-H bonds), and E_formed is 952 kcal (from forming C-C and C-H bonds in propane).

So ΔHf = 772 - 952 = -180 kcal.

Wait, wait a minute, that can't be right because none of the options are that low. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me double-check my calculations.

Breaking bonds:

C-C bonds: 4.5 moles *80 = 360 kcal.

H-H bonds:4 moles *103 = 412 kcal.

Total broken: 360+412=772.

Forming bonds:

2 C-C *80= 160.

8 C-H *99= 792.

Total formed: 160 +792=952.

So ΔHf =772 -952= -180 kcal.

Wait, but that would be the heat of formation for one mole of propane. But looking at the options, the most negative is option G at -30 kcal, which is way higher than -180. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Ah, wait a minute! I think I forgot that the standard heat of formation is calculated per mole of propane, but I considered the energy for 3 moles of C and 4 moles of H2, which is correct, but perhaps I'm using the bond energies in the wrong way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be calculating the sum of the bonds broken (reactants) minus the sum of bonds formed (products) for the reaction as written.

Wait, the correct approach is to calculate the heat of formation as:

ΔHf = [sum (bond energies of reactants)] - [sum (bond energies of products)].

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the correct formula. The heat of formation is the energy change when the compound is formed from its elements. So the process is:

Elements (reactants) → Compound (product).

When you form the compound from the elements, you break the bonds in the elements and form the bonds in the compound.

Breaking bonds in the elements requires energy (positive), and forming bonds in the compound releases energy (negative). So the overall ΔHf is the sum of the bond energies broken (reactants) minus the sum of bond energies formed (products). Or wait, no, it's the other way around.

Wait, let me clarify. The standard formula is:

ΔHf° = Σ (bond energies of gaseous reactants) - Σ (bond energies of gaseous products).

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me look up the correct approach. Oh wait, I can't actually look it up, but I remember that the heat of formation can be estimated using bond energies as follows: the heat of formation is equal to the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (elements in their standard states) multiplied by the number of moles of each bond broken, minus the sum of the bond energies of the products (compound) multiplied by the number of moles of each bond formed.

So in formula terms:

ΔHf° = (number of C-C bonds broken × bond energy of C-C) + (number of H-H bonds broken × bond energy of H-H) ) - (number of C-C bonds formed × bond energy of C-C + number of C-H bonds formed × bond energy of C-H )

Wait, but that can't be right because the C-C bonds in the reactants are in graphite. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try a different approach.

The standard heat of formation for propane can be calculated using the bond energies of the elements in their standard states. The reaction is:

3 C(graphite) + 4 H2(g) → C3H8(g)

In this reaction, the bonds broken are:

- In graphite: each C is bonded to others via C-C bonds. For 3 moles of C, the number of C-C bonds broken is (3 * number of bonds per C) / 2. Since each C in graphite has 3 bonds, for 3 moles of C, that's (3 * 3)/2 = 4.5 moles of C-C bonds.

- In H2: each molecule has one H-H bond. For 4 moles of H2, that's 4 moles of H-H bonds.

The bonds formed in the product (propane) are:

- 2 moles of C-C bonds.

- 8 moles of C-H bonds.

So the energy calculation would be:

Energy required to break bonds in reactants:

= (moles of C-C broken × bond energy of C-C) + (moles of H-H broken × bond energy of H-H)

= (4.5 × 80) + (4 × 103)

= 360 + 412 = 772 kcal.

Energy released when forming bonds in product:

= (moles of C-C formed × bond energy of C-C) + (moles of C-H formed × bond energy of C-H)

= (2 ×80) + (8 ×99)

= 160 + 792 = 952 kcal.

So the heat of formation ΔHf is:

ΔHf = energy required (breaking) - energy released (forming)

= 772 - 952 = -180 kcal.

Wait, but that's way off from any of the answer choices. So I'm definitely making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Oh wait! Maybe I should be considering the bond energies in the opposite way. Because when you form the product, the bonds are formed, releasing energy, so that would subtract from the total.

Wait, no, the formula is:

ΔHf = sum (bond energies of reactants broken) - sum (bond energies of products formed).

Which is what I did, giving -180 kcal, but this isn't among the options. So perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the standard heat of formation is calculated using the stability of the molecule. The more stable (stronger bonds), the more negative the heat of formation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I didn't account for the fact that graphite's bond energy isn't just the C-C bond energy. Wait, but the question gave us bond dissociation energies, so I think the C-C bond energy provided is for graphite.

Wait, another thought: maybe the heat of formation is calculated per mole of bonds, but perhaps I should be considering the total for the entire molecule.

Wait, perhaps I should think per mole of propane. So the calculation I did was for one mole of propane, which uses 3 moles of C and 4 moles of H2. So the calculation seems correct, but the result is -180 kcal/mol, which isn't among the options.

Looking at the options, the choices are from A to J, with the most negative being -35 (A) and -32.1 (H). So clearly, I'm doing something wrong because my answer isn't among them.

Hmm. Let me think of another approach. Maybe I'm supposed to consider the standard heat of formation as the sum of the bond energies of the product minus the sum of the bond energies of the reactants. Wait, that would be the opposite.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because bond formation releases energy, so it should lower the enthalpy.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the heat of formation as the sum of the bond energies of the products (propane) minus the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (graphite and H2). But that doesn't sound right either.

Wait, let me try that. So sum of products' bonds: 2*80 (C-C) +8*99 (C-H) = 160 + 792=952.

Sum of reactants' bonds: 4.5*80 (C-C in graphite) +4*103 (H-H) =360+412=772.

So if I do 952 (product) -772 (reactant) = 180 kcal. Positive, which would mean endothermic, but that doesn't make sense because forming propane should be exothermic, releasing energy.

Wait, but the heat of formation of most stable compounds is negative. So perhaps I should reverse the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

ΔHf = sum (reactant bond energies) - sum (product bond energies).

Which would be 772 (reactants) -952 (products) = -180 kcal. But that's what I did earlier, which gives -180, not matching any options.

So perhaps there's a mistake in the number of bonds I'm considering. Let me recount the bonds in propane.

Propane has three carbon atoms. The structure is CH3-CH2-CH3.

Each C-C bond is between two carbons. So in propane, there are two C-C bonds.

Each C is bonded to H's. The two end C's each have three H's, and the middle C has two H's. So total of 3 + 2 + 3 =8 H's, so eight C-H bonds.

So that part seems correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I'm using the bond energies in the wrong units. The question gives bond energies in kcal/mole, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the heat of formation per mole of propane, but I've calculated for 3 moles of C and 4 moles of H2, which is indeed for one mole of propane. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should be using the bond energies in reverse. Wait, bond dissociation energy is the energy required to break the bond. So when you break a bond, you're adding energy. When you form a bond, you're releasing energy.

So the formula is ΔH = (sum of bond energies broken) - (sum of bond energies formed).

Which would be 772 (broken) - 952 (formed) = -180.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the bond energy for H-H is given as 103 kcal/mol, and for C-H as 99. Maybe I should be using these in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the heat of formation is calculated as the sum of the bond energies of the gaseous atoms minus the sum of the bond energies of the molecule.

Wait, another approach: the heat of formation can be
