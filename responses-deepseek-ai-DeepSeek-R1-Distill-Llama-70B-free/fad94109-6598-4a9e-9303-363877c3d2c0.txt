Question:

A customer at a fish market was leaving the store after purchasing an assortment of shrimp, oysters, and scallops. He was walking along the sidewalk in front of the store when he slipped on a piece of eel. He brought suit against the owner of the market claiming that he suffered leg and back injuries. The owner, although admitting that the customer was injured by slipping on the eel, denied negligence and claimed that the customer was contributorily negligent. At trial, the owner calls a witness to testify that before the fall he heard someone call out to the customer, "Watch it, buddy, you're going to step on that piece of fish. "The witness's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, as it is a statement that was made in the heat of the moment.
B: inadmissible, because the customer did not acknowledge hearing the warning.
C: inadmissible, because it was not a spontaneous utterance.
D: inadmissible, as hearsay not within any exception.
E: admissible, because it is relevant as to the customer's contributory negligence.
F: admissible, because it provides context to the event.
G: inadmissible, because the witness was not directly involved in the incident.
H: admissible, because it indicates that the owner had no control over the situation.
I: admissible, as a statement of the declarant's present state of mind.
J: inadmissible, as it is considered second-hand information.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is a customer who slipped on a piece of eel in front of a fish market. He's suing the owner, claiming injuries. The owner admits the customer was injured but denies negligence, saying the customer was contributorily negligent. At trial, the owner calls a witness who testifies that before the fall, someone called out to the customer, "Watch it, buddy, you're going to step on that piece of fish." The question is about whether this testimony is admissible and why.

The options are A through J, each giving a different reason. So I need to figure out the admissibility of this statement.

First, I remember that hearsay is a big issue in evidence law. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So if someone's testifying about something someone else said outside of court, that's hearsay unless there's an exception.

In this case, the witness is testifying about someone else's warning to the customer. The purpose is probably to show that the customer was warned and thus was contributorily negligent. So the statement is being offered to prove that the customer was warned, which would go to his negligence.

Now, is this statement hearsay? Yes, because it's a statement made by someone else (not the witness) outside of court, and it's being offered to prove the truth—that the customer was warned about the eel.

So the next question is, does it fall under any hearsay exceptions? Common exceptions include excited utterances (like someone shouting during an accident), present-sense impressions, statements against interest, etc.

Looking at the statement, "Watch it, buddy, you're going to step on that piece of fish." When was this said? Right before the fall. So it's a statement made in the heat of the moment, perhaps as the person saw the customer about to step on the eel. That sounds like an excited utterance, which is an exception under FRE 803(2). Excited utterances are admissible if they relate to a startling event and were made while the declarant was under the stress of that event.

Alternatively, it might be a present-sense impression under 803(1), which is a statement describing an event made while the declarant was perceiving it or immediately thereafter.

But in this case, the statement is a warning about an imminent event—the customer stepping on the eel. So it's more of an excited utterance because it's made in reaction to the situation. The person saw the danger and immediately called out.

Wait, but the customer's slipping on the eel is the event. The warning was before the fall, so perhaps it's a statement made in reaction to the potential accident, which would make it an excited utterance.

Alternatively, could it be a present-sense impression? I think present-sense impressions are more about describing an event as it's happening or immediately after, not necessarily a warning. So excited utterance seems more applicable here.

If that's the case, then the statement would fall under the excited utterance exception and be admissible.

But wait, let's look at the options. Option A says it's admissible as a statement made in the heat of the moment. That aligns with the excited utterance idea.

Option C says it's inadmissible because it's not a spontaneous utterance. But if it is spontaneous, then C is wrong. So the key is whether the statement qualifies as an excited utterance.

Another angle: the owner is using this statement to prove that the customer was warned, which would show contributory negligence. So the statement is relevant for that purpose.

But then, there's the issue of whether the customer heard the warning. Option B says it's inadmissible because the customer didn't acknowledge hearing it. But the admissibility of the statement as hearsay doesn't depend on whether the customer heard it. It's about whether the statement itself is admissible. Whether the warning was effective is a separate issue for the jury to decide, regarding the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.

So the statement is admissible as an excited utterance. Therefore, the correct option would be A: admissible as a statement made in the heat of the moment.

Wait, but let me think again. Another possibility is that the statement is not hearsay at all. If the statement is offered not for the truth of the matter (that there was a fish to step on) but for the effect on the listener, but in this case, the owner is offering it to show that the customer was warned, implying he should have been aware. So it's being offered for the truth—that there was a warning. So it's hearsay.

So the only way it's admissible is if it fits an exception. So excited utterance applies.

Looking at the options again:

Option E says it's admissible because it's relevant to the customer's contributory negligence. While that's true about relevance, the question is about admissibility, which requires both relevance and compliance with hearsay rules. So E is correct in part but doesn't address the hearsay issue. So the better answer would be A, which addresses the hearsay exception.

Wait, but another thought: the statement is being made by a third party, not the defendant. So the owner is using it to say the customer was warned. But the statement's admissibility doesn't depend on who made it; it's about whether it's hearsay and falls under an exception.

So the witness's testimony about the statement is hearsay unless an exception applies. So the correct ground is that it's an excited utterance, making option A correct.

Wait, but option E says it's admissible because it's relevant as to the customer's contributory negligence. But that doesn't address the hearsay issue. So even if it's relevant, if it's hearsay without an exception, it's inadmissible. So E is not the reason for admissibility; it's about why it's being offered. The admissibility hinges on the hearsay exception.

So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but some might argue that the statement is not an excited utterance. For example, if the person who made the statement wasn't involved in the event. But I think the key is whether the statement was made in the stress of the exciting event. Here, the event is the potential slipping, so the person's warning was under the stress of that, making it an excited utterance.

So I think the answer is A.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a witness's testimony regarding a statement made before the customer's fall. The witness testified that someone called out, "Watch it, buddy, you're going to step on that piece of fish," which the owner seeks to use to prove the customer's contributory negligence. The key issue is whether this statement is admissible under the rules of evidence, particularly in relation to hearsay.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the statement is being offered to show that the customer was warned about the eel, making it hearsay. However, hearsay is admissible if it falls under an exception. One such exception is the "excited utterance" rule (FRE 803(2)), which applies to statements made in the heat of the moment in response to a startling event.

The statement in question was made immediately before the fall, in reaction to the imminent danger of the customer stepping on the eel. This indicates that it was made under the stress of the event, qualifying it as an excited utterance. Therefore, the statement is admissible under this exception.

Other options are less relevant or incorrect. For example, Option B focuses on whether the customer heard the warning, which affects the weight of the evidence but not its admissibility. Option C incorrectly claims the statement is not spontaneous, but the context suggests it was indeed spontaneous. Option E correctly notes the statement's relevance to contributory negligence but does not address the hearsay issue, which is the critical factor here.

Thus, the correct answer is that the statement is admissible as an excited utterance, making Option A the best choice.
