Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says there's a cylinder containing a mixture of liquid water and water vapor in equilibrium. The pressure inside is 100 lbf per square inch, and the total volume is 10 cubic feet. The total mass is 30 pounds mass. I need to find the volume and mass of both the liquid and the vapor parts.

Hmm, I remember that when a liquid and vapor are in equilibrium, they're at the saturation state for that pressure. So first, I think I need to find the saturation properties at 100 lbf/in². Wait, but wait, 100 lbf/in² is a pretty high pressure. I think that's above atmospheric pressure. 

I should look up the saturation temperature and the specific volumes of the liquid and vapor at that pressure. But wait, I probably can't access tables right now. Wait, maybe I can remember or approximate some values. Let me think. At atmospheric pressure (14.7 psia), water boils, and the specific volume of liquid is around 0.0177 cubic feet per pound mass, and vapor is much larger. But at higher pressures, the specific volume of the liquid increases a little, and the vapor's specific volume decreases.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I can convert the pressure to a more familiar unit. 100 lbf/in² is 100 psi. Since 1 psi is about 0.00689476 MPa, but maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, knowing that 100 psi is about 6.8 bar. Wait, but I'm probably supposed to use imperial units here.

So, I think I need the saturation data for water at 100 psi. Let me try to recall from the steam tables. At 100 psi, the saturation temperature is... I think it's around 327.8 degrees Fahrenheit. But maybe that's not directly needed. More importantly, the specific volumes: v_f (specific volume of liquid) and v_g (specific volume of vapor) at 100 psi.

From what I remember, for water at 100 psi (which is about 6.8 bar), the specific volume of the liquid (v_f) is approximately 0.0177 cubic feet per lbm. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, at higher pressures, the specific volume of the liquid increases slightly. Or wait, no. Wait, let me think: At high pressures, the density of the liquid increases, so specific volume (which is inverse of density) would decrease. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, specific volume is volume per mass. So higher pressure makes the liquid denser, so lower specific volume. Or wait, no, wait when pressure increases, for liquids, the specific volume decreases because they're not very compressible. So maybe for 100 psi, v_f is slightly less than 0.0177 ft³/lbm. Or maybe it's around 0.017.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure, so perhaps I should proceed with that assumption. Let's just say v_f is about 0.017 ft³/lbm. Then the specific volume of vapor, v_g, is much higher. At 100 psi, I think v_g is around 4.4 cubic feet per lbm. Wait, no, that seems high. Wait, no, at 100 psi, the vapor specific volume is about 0.0177 maybe? No, wait, that can't be right. Because at atmospheric pressure, the vapor specific volume is about 26.8 ft³/lbm. So at higher pressures, it's lower. So 100 psi, maybe around 4.4? Or maybe 0.044 ft³/lbm? Wait, no, that would make it too small. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of cubic meters per kilogram, but no, let's stick to imperial units.

Wait, maybe I should recall that at 100 psi, the specific volume of the vapor is about 4.4 cubic feet per pound mass. That sounds right. So, v_g ≈ 4.4 ft³/lbm, and v_f ≈ 0.017 ft³/lbm.

Wait, but I'm confusing myself. Let me try to think: At 14.7 psi (atmospheric), v_g is about 26.8 ft³/lbm. As pressure increases, v_g decreases. So at 100 psi, which is higher than atmospheric, v_g should be lower than 26.8. Let me see: I think at 100 psi, v_g is approximately 4.43 ft³/lbm. So I'll go with that. And for v_f, maybe it's about 0.0177 ft³/lbm. Wait, but wait, I think at higher pressures, the liquid's specific volume is slightly lower than at atmospheric. Wait, no, maybe it's higher. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with approximate values.

So, assuming that:

v_f ≈ 0.0177 ft³/lbm (specific volume of liquid)
v_g ≈ 4.43 ft³/lbm (specific volume of vapor)

Wait, but I'm not confident about these numbers, but let's proceed.

The total mass is 30 lbm. Let me denote m as the mass of the liquid. Then the mass of the vapor would be (30 - m) lbm.

The total volume is 10 ft³. The volume of the liquid would be m * v_f, and the volume of the vapor would be (30 - m) * v_g.

So, the sum of the two volumes should be 10 ft³:

m * v_f + (30 - m) * v_g = 10

Plugging in the values for v_f and v_g:

m * 0.0177 + (30 - m) * 4.43 = 10

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, expand the equation:

0.0177 m + 4.43 * 30 - 4.43 m = 10

Calculate 4.43 * 30: 4.43 * 30 = 132.9

So:

0.0177 m + 132.9 - 4.43 m = 10

Combine like terms:

(0.0177 - 4.43) m + 132.9 = 10

0.0177 - 4.43 is approximately -4.4123

So:

-4.4123 m + 132.9 = 10

Subtract 132.9 from both sides:

-4.4123 m = 10 - 132.9

10 - 132.9 is -122.9

So:

-4.4123 m = -122.9

Divide both sides by -4.4123:

m = (-122.9) / (-4.4123) ≈ 122.9 / 4.4123 ≈ let's compute that.

4.4123 * 27 = approx 119.1131 (since 4*27=108, 0.4123*27≈11.1321; total ≈119.13)
So 27 would give about 119.13, which is less than 122.9. So 27 + (122.9 - 119.13)/4.4123 ≈ 27 + (3.77)/4.4123 ≈ 27 + 0.854 ≈ 27.854 lbm.

Wait, but that can't be right because the total mass is 30 lbm. If m is 27.85, then the vapor mass would be 2.15 lbm. That seems possible, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake in v_g and v_f.

Wait, if v_g is 4.43, that's a huge specific volume, which would mean a small mass. Let me think again. Wait, 4.43 ft³/lbm seems way too high. That would mean that 1 lbm of vapor takes up 4.43 ft³. But 10 ft³ is the total volume, so if the vapor's specific volume is 4.43, then the mass of vapor would be 10 /4.43 ≈ 2.258 lbm. But the total mass is 30 lbm, so that would imply that the mass of liquid is 27.74 lbm, but that's way higher than the options given. Wait, but the options have the mass of vapor around 2 lbm, so maybe this approach is correct.

Wait, let me try plugging in some numbers again. Let's try m = 0.8 lbm.

Wait, no, let me try to see which option makes sense. The total mass is 30 lbm. So if the vapor is around 2 lbm, then the liquid is about 28 lbm.

But looking at the options, for part a) the mass of liquid is mostly around 0.7 to 1.0 lbm, which doesn't make sense because 0.7 lbm would mean the vapor is 29.3 lbm, which can't be right because vapor's specific volume is high, so its mass would be low.

Wait a second, I think I made a mistake in the specific volumes. Maybe I confused the units. Because 1 cubic foot per pound is actually a very large specific volume. Wait, no, for vapor, it's correct. But for liquid, maybe I have the specific volume wrong.

Wait, I think I messed up the specific volume values. Let me think again. At 100 psi, the specific volume of the liquid (v_f) is about 0.0177 ft³/lbm. That's correct. But for the vapor (v_g), maybe it's around 0.04 ft³/lbm? No, that can't be right. Because at higher pressures, vapor's specific volume decreases. Wait, 100 psi is about 6.8 bar, and at around 6 bar, the vapor specific volume is approximately 0.272 m³/kg, which converts to about 4.37 ft³/lbm (since 1 m³/kg is roughly 3.605 ft³/lbm). So 0.272 m³/kg * 3.605 ≈ 0.98 ft³/lbm. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. So perhaps v_g is around 0.98 ft³/lbm at 100 psi.

Wait, that makes more sense because 0.98 is much less than 4.43, which I think was my initial mistake. So let me correct that. So v_f = 0.0177 ft³/lbm, v_g ≈ 0.98 ft³/lbm.

So now, the equation becomes:

m * 0.0177 + (30 - m) * 0.98 = 10

Expanding:

0.0177 m + 0.98 *30 - 0.98 m = 10

Calculate 0.98 *30 = 29.4

So:

0.0177 m +29.4 -0.98 m = 10

Combine terms:

(0.0177 - 0.98)m + 29.4 =10

That's (-0.9623)m +29.4=10

Subtract 29.4:

-0.9623 m = -19.4

Divide both sides by -0.9623:

m = 19.4 / 0.9623 ≈ 20.17 lbm

Wait, that gives m ≈20.17 lbm as the mass of liquid. Then the vapor would be 30 -20.17 =9.83 lbm. But that would mean the vapor's volume is 9.83 *0.98 ≈9.65 ft³, and the liquid's volume is 20.17 *0.0177≈0.357 ft³. But the total volume would be 0.357 +9.65 ≈10 ft³, which matches. But wait, this gives the mass of liquid as 20.17 lbm, which is way higher than any of the options provided. The options for mass of liquid are all below 1 lbm, except for options D, which has 0.8 lbm, and option I with 0.9 lbm. So I must have messed up the specific volumes.

Wait, perhaps I confused the units for specific volume. Maybe the specific volume is in cubic feet per pound, but for vapor, it's much higher. Wait, let me think again. Oh! Maybe I got the specific volume of vapor wrong. At 100 psi, the specific volume of vapor is actually about 4.43 cubic feet per pound mass. Wait, that would make more sense because at higher pressure, the vapor is denser, so specific volume is lower than atmospheric, but still higher than liquid.

So let me correct that. Let me take v_f = 0.0177 ft³/lbm, v_g =4.43 ft³/lbm.

So the equation is:

m *0.0177 + (30 - m) *4.43 =10

Expanding:

0.0177 m + 4.43*30 -4.43 m =10

4.43 *30 = 132.9

So:

0.0177 m +132.9 -4.43 m =10

Combine terms:

(0.0177 -4.43)m +132.9 =10

Which is:

-4.4123 m +132.9 =10

Subtract 132.9:

-4.4123 m = -122.9

Divide both sides by -4.4123:

m = 122.9 /4.4123 ≈27.85 lbm

So the mass of the liquid is approximately 27.85 lbm, and the mass of vapor is 30 -27.85=2.15 lbm.

Wait, but the options don't have anything like that. All the options have the mass of liquid around 0.7 to 1 lbm, except option D. So I'm confused. Because according to this calculation, the mass of liquid is about 27.85 lbm, but that's not any of the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong specific volumes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used v_g as 0.0443 ft³/lbm? Because 4.43 would make the vapor's specific volume way too high, leading to a very small mass. Wait, no, 4.43 ft³ per lbm would mean that a small amount of mass would occupy a lot of volume. So if the total volume is 10 ft³, then the vapor's volume would be (30 -m)*4.43. If m is 27.85 lbm, then (30-27.85)=2.15 lbm, so vapor volume is 2.15 *4.43≈9.53 ft³. So total volume is 27.85 *0.0177≈0.493 ft³ for liquid, plus 9.53 for vapor, total≈10.023, which is close to 10. So that seems correct, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong pressure. Maybe the pressure is 100 lbf/in² absolute, but perhaps the saturation tables are in absolute pressure. Because 100 psi could be gauge or absolute. Wait, but in thermodynamics, when they just say pressure, it's usually absolute. So 100 psi absolute would be 114.7 psi gauge, but perhaps that's not relevant here.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe I should use the specific volume in terms of v = volume/mass, but perhaps I have the equation backwards. Wait, no, the equation is correct. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the cylinder is a mixture of liquid and vapor, so the quality (x) is the mass fraction of vapor. So, x = m_vapor / m_total. The total volume is V = m_total (v_f + x (v_g - v_f)).

Wait, that's another approach. Let me try that.

The specific volume equation for a mixture is v = v_f + x (v_g - v_f)

Given that the total volume V = m_total * v

So, v = V / m_total = 10 ft³ /30 lbm ≈0.3333 ft³/lbm

So, 0.3333 = v_f + x (v_g - v_f)

We can solve for x.

We need v_f and v_g at 100 psi.

Wait, again, I'm stuck on the correct values for v_f and v_g. Let me try to get the exact values.

Looking it up in the steam tables at 100 psi (absolute), the saturation properties are:

Temperature: 327.81°F

v_f = 0.01774 ft³/lbm

v_g = 4.4326 ft³/lbm

So plugging these in:

v = 0.01774 + x*(4.4326 -0.01774) = 0.01774 + x*4.41486

And we have v = 0.3333 ft³/lbm

So:

0.3333 =0.01774 +4.41486 x

Subtract 0.01774:

0.3333 -0.01774 =4.41486 x

0.31556 =4.41486 x

x =0.31556 /4.41486 ≈0.0715 or 7.15%

So the quality is about 7.15%, meaning that 7.15% of the mass is vapor, and 92.85% is liquid.

So mass of vapor =30 lbm *0.0715 ≈2.145 lbm

Mass of liquid =30 -2.145≈27.855 lbm

Then, volume of liquid =27.855 lbm *0.01774 ft³/lbm≈0.493 ft³

Volume of vapor =2.145 lbm *4.4326 ft³/lbm≈9.51 ft³

Which adds up to ≈0.493 +9.51≈10.003 ft³, which is close to 10, considering rounding errors.

But looking at the options, none of them have the mass of liquid as high as 27 lbm. All the options for part a) have the mass of liquid less than 1 lbm except option D (0.8) and option I (0.9). So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the pressure is 100 lbf/in² gauge, not absolute. So 100 psi gauge would be 100 +14.7 =114.7 psi absolute. Let me check the saturation properties at 114.7 psi.

Wait, but without exact tables, it's hard, but let me assume that at higher pressure, v_f is slightly smaller and v_g is smaller as well. So at 114.7 psi, v_f might be around 0.017
