Question:

Stock A has a beta of 0.8, while Stock B has a beta of 1.4. The expected return on the market is 10% and the risk-free rate is 7%. Using CAPM and this stock information, what is the required rate of return for Stocks A and B, respectively?

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), and I need to find the required rate of return for two stocks, A and B. Hmm, I remember CAPM from my finance class. The formula is something like required return equals the risk-free rate plus beta multiplied by the market's expected return minus the risk-free rate. Oh wait, right, it's Rf + beta*(Rm - Rf).

So the question gives me the betas for both stocks. Stock A has a beta of 0.8, and Stock B has a beta of 1.4. The market's expected return is 10%, and the risk-free rate is 7%. I need to calculate each stock's required return.

Let me start with Stock A. Plugging into the formula: R_A = Rf + beta_A*(Rm - Rf). So that's 7% + 0.8*(10% -7%). Let me compute the numbers. 10% minus 7% is 3%, right? Multiply that by 0.8 gives 2.4%. So adding the risk-free rate, 7% + 2.4% equals 9.4%. Okay, so Stock A's required return is 9.4%.

Now for Stock B. Beta is 1.4. So R_B = 7% + 1.4*(10% -7%). Again, 10-7 is 3%. Multiply by 1.4 gives... let's see, 1.4 times 3 is 4.2%. So adding to 7% gives 11.2%. So Stock B's required return is 11.2%.

Looking back at the options, I need to find which option lists 9.4% and 11.2% in order. Let's scan through the options:

Option C says 9.4% and 11.2%. That matches what I calculated. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure. For Stock A: 0.8 times 3 is 2.4, plus 7 is 9.4. Yep. For B:1.4*3=4.2, plus 7 is 11.2. Yes, that's correct. So definitely option C.

To determine the required rate of return for Stocks A and B using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), we use the formula:

\[
R = R_f + \beta \times (R_m - R_f)
\]

### For Stock A:
- \( \beta_A = 0.8 \)
- \( R_f = 7\% \)
- \( R_m = 10\% \)

\[
R_A = 7\% + 0.8 \times (10\% - 7\%) = 7\% + 0.8 \times 3\% = 7\% + 2.4\% = 9.4\%
\]

### For Stock B:
- \( \beta_B = 1.4 \)
- \( R_f = 7\% \)
- \( R_m = 10\% \)

\[
R_B = 7\% + 1.4 \times (10\% - 7\%) = 7\% + 1.4 \times 3\% = 7\% + 4.2\% = 11.2\%
\]

The required rates of return are **9.4% for Stock A** and **11.2% for Stock B**. Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C: 9.4% and 11.2%**

C
