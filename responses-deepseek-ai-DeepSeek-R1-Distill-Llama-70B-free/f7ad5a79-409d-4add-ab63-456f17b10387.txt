Okay, so I've got this economics question here about tax burden when a good is taxed. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me remember what I learned in class.

The question is asking under what conditions the tax burden falls mainly on the consumer. The options are about the elasticity of demand and supply. Hmm, elasticity determines how responsive the quantity demanded or supplied is to a change in price.

I remember that when a tax is imposed, it affects the market equilibrium. The tax can be thought of as a wedge between what consumers pay and what producers receive. The side that's less elastic ends up bearing more of the tax burden because they can't adjust as much.

So, if demand is inelastic, consumers aren't very responsive to price changes. That means when a tax is added, the price they pay goes up, and they don't reduce their buying much. On the other hand, if supply is elastic, producers can adjust the quantity they supply more easily. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the supply's elasticity affects how much the producers can shift the burden. Let me think again.

Wait, the tax is usually split between consumers and producers. The side that's more inelastic bears a larger share. So if demand is inelastic, consumers can't adjust much, so they bear more. If supply is elastic, producers can adjust more, so they pass less of the tax onto consumers. Wait, no, no, wait.

Wait, when supply is elastic, producers can change their output a lot when price changes. So if the tax is imposed, the producers would adjust by producing less, but if their supply is elastic, they can reduce supply a lot. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to structure this. The tax increases the price for consumers and decreases the price that producers receive because the government takes a cut. The burden on consumers is the difference between the old price and the new higher price. The burden on producers is the difference between the old price and the new lower price they receive.

So, the more elastic the demand, the more consumers can reduce their quantity demanded when the price rises. So if demand is elastic, consumers can avoid some of the tax by buying less. That means the burden on consumers is less. Conversely, if demand is inelastic, consumers can't reduce much, so they bear more of the tax.

Similarly, for supply: if supply is elastic, producers can reduce their quantity supplied a lot when the price they receive drops. So if supply is elastic, producers can shift more of the tax burden to consumers because they decrease supply, which drives the price up for consumers. Wait, no, maybe not. Let's think again.

Wait, the tax incidence depends on the relative elasticities. The formula I remember is that the tax burden falls more on the side which is less elastic. So, if demand is inelastic and supply is elastic, then consumers are less elastic (inelastic demand), so they bear more of the tax. Because producers can adjust their supply more easily, so they don't bear as much. So the tax burden falls mainly on consumers when demand is inelastic and supply is elastic.

Looking back at the options, option G says demand is inelastic and supply is elastic. That matches what I just thought.

So the correct answer should be G.

When a tax is imposed on a good, the tax burden is distributed between consumers and producers based on the elasticity of demand and supply. Elasticity measures how responsive the quantity demanded or supplied is to a change in price. 

- **Inelastic demand** means consumers are less responsive to price changes, so they bear a larger share of the tax burden because they cannot significantly reduce their purchases.
- **Elastic supply** means producers can adjust the quantity supplied more easily in response to price changes, allowing them to shift more of the tax burden to consumers.

Thus, the tax burden falls mainly on consumers when demand is inelastic (consumers cannot reduce their purchases much) and supply is elastic (producers can adjust their output). This corresponds to option **G**.

Answer: G
