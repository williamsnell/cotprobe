Okay, so I've got this problem about designing a direct-vision prism using flint-glass and crown-glass prisms. Hmm, I remember that direct-vision prisms are used to correct chromatic aberration, right? So the idea is that the two prisms (one flint and one crown) are combined in a way that they cancel each other's dispersion but add up their deviations.

The question has two parts, (a) and (b). First, I need to find the apex angle of the crown-glass prism, A, given that the flint's apex angle A' is 10 degrees. Then, I have to find the net dispersion of the direct-vision prism.

Wait, I think the key here is the concept of mean deviation and dispersive power. The mean deviation for a prism is given by δ = (n - 1) * A, where n is the refractive index and A is the apex angle in degrees. Oh wait, wait, no—wait, I think the mean deviation is calculated using the formula δ = (n_avg - 1) * A. And the dispersive power ω is (n_F - n_C) / (n_avg - 1), but wait, maybe it's (n for F - n for C) divided by some average? Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, dispersive power ω is defined as (n_F - n_C) / (n_avg - 1), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the dispersive power is given for each glass, so flint has a higher dispersive power than crown. So for each prism, the mean deviation δ is (n - 1) * A, and the dispersion is ω * δ, where ω is the dispersive power.

Wait, no, another approach. The mean deviation δ is given by (n - 1) * A, where n is the refractive index for the mean wavelength (like sodium D line). The dispersive power ω is (n_F - n_C) where F and C are the indices for the F and C lines. Wait, but in the problem, the dispersive powers are given as .031 and .018 for flint and crown, respectively. So perhaps that's the value we use directly.

Wait, the problem states: dispersive powers of .031 and .018. So for part (a), the condition is δ_D = δ_D', which I think refers to the mean deviation of the crown and flint prisms being equal. Because that way, when combined, their deviations cancel out, but their dispersions add in a way to correct chromatic aberration.

So the setup is that each prism has its own mean deviation, but to make δ_D (crown) equal to δ_D' (flint), so that δ_crown = δ_flint.

Wait, so for the crown prism, the mean deviation is δ = (n_c - 1) * A. And for the flint prism, δ' = (n_f - 1) * A'. But according to the problem, δ_D = δ_D', so we have (n_c - 1) * A = (n_f - 1) * A'.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the mean angles of deviation of the crown and flint prisms are equal. So δ_D (crown) equals δ_D' (flint). Therefore:

(n_c - 1) * A = (n_f - 1) * A'

We can solve for A, the apex angle of the crown prism.

Given that A' is 10 degrees, n_f is 1.620, and n_c is 1.508.

So plugging in the numbers:

(1.508 - 1) * A = (1.620 - 1) * 10

Calculates to:

0.508 * A = 0.620 * 10

0.508 A = 6.2

A = 6.2 / 0.508 ≈ let me compute that.

6.2 divided by 0.508. Let's see, 0.508 times 12 is 6.096. 0.508 * 12.2 is about 6.2. Let me compute:

0.508 * 12.2 = ?

0.5 *12.2 = 6.1, 0.008 *12.2=0.0976. So total 6.1 + 0.0976 = 6.1976, which is approximately 6.2. So A ≈ 12.2 degrees.

Wait, but let me check my math because I might be making an error. Let me compute 6.2 divided by 0.508.

Alternatively, 0.508 = 508/1000 = 127/250.

So 6.2 is 62/10 = 31/5.

So 31/5 divided by 127/250 = (31/5) * (250/127) = (31 * 50) / 127 = 1550 / 127 ≈ approx 12.2.

Yes, so A is about 12.2 degrees. So that's part (a).

Now part (b) is the net dispersion of the direct-vision prism. I think the net dispersion is the difference between the dispersion caused by each prism. Because the idea is that the flint and crown prisms' dispersions are opposite, and so the net would be the sum? Wait, no. Wait, for a direct-vision prism, the dispersion is the difference between the two prisms' dispersions.

Wait, the dispersion for each prism is given by their dispersive power multiplied by their apex angle. Wait, but earlier I thought the dispersive power was given as 0.031 and 0.018. Wait, in the problem statement: "dispersive powers .031 and .018", for flint and crown.

So the dispersion for each would be ω * A, where ω is the dispersive power and A is the apex angle.

But wait, is it? Or is it δ * ω, where δ is the mean deviation?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the total deviation and the dispersion. The mean deviation is (n-1)*A, and the dispersion is (n_F - n_C) * A, but the problem gives the dispersive power as ω = (n_F - n_C)/(n - 1). So for each prism, the dispersion would be ω * δ, where δ is the mean deviation.

Wait, but since in part (a) we have δ_crown = δ_flint, then perhaps the dispersion for each is ω_c * δ and ω_f * δ, but since the prisms are in opposite directions (one flint, one crown), the net dispersion would be (ω_f - ω_c) * δ.

Wait, but wait, because the crown and flint prisms are arranged so that their dispersions oppose each other. So the net dispersion D is given by (ω_f - ω_c) * A_avg, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, each prism contributes a dispersion of ω * δ, but since they are combined in the same direction, you subtract them. Wait, but in a direct-vision prism, the two prisms are arranged such that the dispersion from one cancels the other, except for the desired net. Wait, no, in a direct-vision prism, the two prisms are placed in such a way that their mean deviations are equal and opposite, but their dispersions add. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think like this: the total deviation is δ_crown - δ_flint, but we've set δ_crown = δ_flint, so the total deviation is zero? No, but wait, in a direct-vision prism, the total deviation is zero because the two prisms' deviations cancel each other, but the net dispersion is the sum of their individual dispersions.

Wait, so each prism contributes a dispersion of ω * A, but since they are made from different materials, the net dispersion would be (ω_f - ω_c) * A, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, let me get back. The problem says that the mean angles of deviation are equal, so δ_crown = δ_flint = δ. Then, the dispersion from each is D_crown = ω_c * δ, and D_flint = ω_f * δ. But since the prisms are used in a way that their dispersions add up, the net dispersion would be (ω_f - ω_c) * δ?

Wait, but wait, the dispersion for each is ω * δ, and since the prisms are arranged to have their dispersions oppose each other, the net would be the difference. But I'm not entirely certain about the direction. Alternatively, perhaps the net dispersion is D = (ω_f - ω_c) * δ.

But wait, the problem gives the dispersive powers as 0.031 (flint) and 0.018 (crown). So ω_f = 0.031, ω_c = 0.018.

So the net dispersion would be (ω_f - ω_c) * δ, but wait, because the crown and flint prisms have opposite dispersions, their dispersions would subtract. So D = (ω_f - ω_c) * δ.

Wait, but let me think again. The formula for the net dispersion in a direct-vision prism is D = (ω1 * A1) - (ω2 * A2), but since we're given that δ1 = δ2, and δ = (n-1)*A, so A1 = (n2-1)*A2/(n1-1), perhaps. But in this problem, we have A for crown and A' for flint, with (n_c -1) A = (n_f -1) A' => A = [(n_f -1)/(n_c -1)] * A'.

We found A to be approximately 12.2 degrees. So the dispersions would be D_crown = ω_c * δ_crown, D_flint = ω_f * δ_flint. Since δ_crown = δ_flint = δ, then D_net = D_flint - D_crown = (ω_f - ω_c) * δ.

Yes, that makes sense. So D_net = (ω_f - ω_c) * δ.

But wait, since δ is the same for both, because we set them equal. So δ is (n_c -1)*A = (1.508-1)*12.2 ≈ 0.508 * 12.2 ≈ let's compute that.

0.508 * 12 is 6.096. 0.508 * 0.2 is 0.1016. So total δ ≈ 6.096 + 0.1016 = 6.1976 degrees.

So D_net = (0.031 - 0.018) * 6.1976 = (0.013) * 6.1976 ≈ 0.08057 degrees.

So approximately 0.0806 degrees.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says the net dispersion is 0.081 degrees. So that would match.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

First, calculating A:

(n_c -1) * A = (n_f -1) * A'

n_c = 1.508 → 0.508
n_f = 1.620 → 0.620
A' = 10 degrees.

So 0.508 * A = 0.620 *10 → 6.2 → A = 6.2 / 0.508 ≈ 12.2 degrees.

Then, δ for each is (n-1)*A. For crown, δ = 0.508 * 12.2 ≈ 6.1976 degrees.

Dispersion from each:

D_crown = ω_c * δ = 0.018 * 6.1976 ≈ 0.11156 degrees.
D_flint = ω_f * δ = 0.031 * 6.1976 ≈ 0.19218 degrees.

Wait, wait a second. No, because the prisms are arranged such that their dispersions oppose each other. So the net dispersion would be D_flint - D_crown, but wait, that would be 0.19218 - 0.11156 ≈ 0.0806 degrees, which is about 0.0806, so 0.081 when rounded. That's option D.

Looking back at the options, option D is: apex angle of crown is 12.2 degrees, net dispersion 0.081 degrees. So that would be the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the apex angle of the crown-glass prism and the net dispersion of the direct-vision prism. The key equations and steps are as follows:

### Part (a): Apex Angle of the Crown-Glass Prism
The condition given is that the mean angles of deviation for the crown-glass and flint-glass prisms are equal:  
\[
\delta_D = \delta_D'
\]  
The mean deviation for a prism is given by:  
\[
\delta = (n - 1) \cdot A
\]  
where \(n\) is the refractive index and \(A\) is the apex angle. For the crown-glass prism:  
\[
\delta_D = (n_c - 1) \cdot A
\]  
For the flint-glass prism:  
\[
\delta_D' = (n_f - 1) \cdot A'
\]  
Since \(\delta_D = \delta_D'\), we equate the two expressions:  
\[
(n_c - 1) \cdot A = (n_f - 1) \cdot A'
\]  
Given \(n_c = 1.508\), \(n_f = 1.620\), and \(A' = 10.0^\circ\), we solve for \(A\):  
\[
(1.508 - 1) \cdot A = (1.620 - 1) \cdot 10.0
\]  
\[
0.508 \cdot A = 0.620 \cdot 10.0
\]  
\[
A = \frac{6.2}{0.508} \approx 12.2^\circ
\]  

### Part (b): Net Dispersion of the Direct-Vision Prism
The net dispersion is the difference between the dispersions of the two prisms. Dispersion for each prism is given by:  
\[
D = \omega \cdot \delta
\]  
where \(\omega\) is the dispersive power and \(\delta\) is the mean deviation. Since \(\delta_D = \delta_D'\), the net dispersion is:  
\[
D_{\text{net}} = (\omega_f - \omega_c) \cdot \delta
\]  
Substituting \(\omega_f = 0.031\), \(\omega_c = 0.018\), and \(\delta = (n_c - 1) \cdot A = 0.508 \cdot 12.2 \approx 6.1976^\circ\):  
\[
D_{\text{net}} = (0.031 - 0.018) \cdot 6.1976
\]  
\[
D_{\text{net}} = 0.013 \cdot 6.1976 \approx 0.0806^\circ
\]  
Rounding to three decimal places:  
\[
D_{\text{net}} \approx 0.081^\circ
\]  

### Final Answer
The apex angle of the crown-glass prism is \(12.2^\circ\), and the net dispersion of the direct-vision prism is \(0.081^\circ\). This corresponds to **option D**.
