Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the Btu needed to heat water. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question is asking how many Btu are required to raise the temperature of 2 pounds of water from 32°F to 212°F. I remember that Btu stands for British Thermal Units, which is a measure of energy. 

First, I need to figure out the temperature change. The initial temperature is 32°F, which is the freezing point of water, and the final is 212°F, the boiling point. So the change in temperature is 212 minus 32. Let me calculate that: 212 - 32 = 180°F. So the temperature increases by 180 degrees.

Now, I recall that the specific heat capacity of water is important here. Specific heat is the amount of heat per unit mass required to raise the temperature by one degree. For water, I think the specific heat capacity is around 1 Btu per pound per degree Fahrenheit. Wait, or is it in calories? Oh right, in the metric system it's calories, but here we're using Btu and pounds, so it's 1 Btu per pound per degree.

So the formula should be Btu = mass * specific heat * temperature change. Plugging in the numbers: mass is 2 pounds, specific heat is 1 Btu/lb°F, and the temperature change is 180°F. 

So Btu = 2 lb * 1 Btu/lb°F * 180°F = 360 Btu. Hmm, wait, but let me double-check that. Because sometimes I might mix up the units, like using Celsius instead. But since both the initial and final temperatures are in Fahrenheit, and the specific heat is per Fahrenheit degree, it should be correct.

Wait, another thought—sometimes the latent heat comes into play, but that's for phase changes, like turning water into steam. Oh, right, but this problem is only about heating water from 32°F to 212°F, which is all liquid. So we don't need to consider latent heat here. Just the sensible heat.

So the calculation is straightforward: 2 * 180 = 360 Btu. Looking at the options, option F is 360 Btu. So the answer should be F.

Wait, another way to think about it: 1 Btu is the energy to raise 1 pound of water by 1°F. So for each pound, each degree is 1 Btu. So 2 pounds times 180 degrees would be 360 Btu. Yep, that makes sense. So I'm confident the answer is F.

To determine how many Btu are required to raise the temperature of 2 pounds of water from 32°F to 212°F, we start by calculating the temperature change:

\[
\Delta T = 212°F - 32°F = 180°F
\]

The specific heat capacity of water is approximately \(1 \, \text{Btu/lb°F}\). Using the formula for heat energy:

\[
\text{Btu} = \text{mass} \times \text{specific heat} \times \Delta T
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Btu} = 2 \, \text{lb} \times 1 \, \text{Btu/lb°F} \times 180°F = 360 \, \text{Btu}
\]

This calculation only involves sensible heat, as the problem does not include a phase change. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**F: 360 Btu**

Answer: F
