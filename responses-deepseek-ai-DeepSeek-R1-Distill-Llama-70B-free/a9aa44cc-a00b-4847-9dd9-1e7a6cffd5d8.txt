Question:

A housing corporation owned a tract of land and prepared a development plan to divide the land into 100 lots and create a residential community on the property. The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, an administrative entity that would administer and enforce the regulations' and restrictions recited in the Declaration of Covenants. One of the restrictions reads:"There shall never at any time be erected, permitted, or maintained upon any part of the property any structure designed for or used as a saloon or place for the sale or manufacture of malt, vinous, or spirituous liquors. "The Declaration of Covenants was duly recorded and was included in the deed taken by a psychologist when he purchased lot 24 in the housing development. The psychologist recorded his deed. The psychologist gave his lot to his son. The deed conveying lot 24 to the son contained no reference to the Declaration of Covenants or any of its provisions. The deed provided that "these premises are conveyed to (the son), his heirs, and assigns, as long as they are used for residential purposes only. " The son did not record his deed. The son was unaware of the Declaration of Covenants. The son started a home business selling imported wine from his home. A geologist, the owner of lot 26, which was situated next to the son's lot, brought an action of ejectment against the son. Which of the following is the best argument for the son?

Options:

A: Not having been recorded, the condition cannot be enforced against the son.
B: The son's business does not qualify as a saloon or place for manufacture of liquors.
C: The law prohibits a fee simple determinable.
D: The deed to the son created a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter, giving the psychologist, but not the geologist, the right to sue the son.
E: The geologist is entitled only to an injunction against the son.
F: The son was not aware of the Declaration of Covenants, thus should not be held accountable.
G: The psychologist did not explicitly forbid the sale of alcohol in the deed to the son.
H: The geologist has no right to sue as the son's business does not affect him directly.
I: The prohibition in the Declaration of Covenants does not apply as the son did not purchase the lot.

Okay, so I have this question about property law, specifically dealing with covenants and restrictions. Hmm, let me try to break this down. 

So, there's a housing corporation that developed land into 100 lots. They have a Declaration of Covenants which created a community association to enforce the rules. One of the restrictions is that no structure can be built or used as a saloon or place for selling or making liquor. This was recorded, and when the psychologist bought lot 24, it was included in his deed. He then gave the lot to his son, but the deed to the son didn't mention the Declaration of Covenants. The son's deed just says the property is for residential use only. Also, the son didn't record his deed and didn't know about the covenants. Now, the son is selling wine from home, and the geologist next door is suing him.

The question is about the best argument for the son. The options are A through I.

First, I need to remember how covenants work. There are two types: real covenants and equitable servitudes. Real covenants require privity and the covenant must touch and concern the land. Equitable servitudes usually come from a common plan and are enforced through injunctions by courts of equity.

The Declaration of Covenants was recorded, so it's part of the common scheme. When the psychologist bought the lot, he was bound by it. Then he conveyed the lot to his son. The deed to the son didn't mention the covenants, but that might not matter because the original covenant was recorded. 

Wait, but when the psychologist conveyed the lot, did he include the covenant? If the original covenant is in the deed, then subsequent owners are bound, even if it's not mentioned again. But if the deed to the son didn't include it, does that matter? No, because the covenant is already part of the land. It's a burden that runs with the land, so the son is still subject to it, even if he didn't know.

So the son's argument can't be that he didn't know. So option F is probably not a good argument.

Option A says the condition can't be enforced because it wasn't recorded. But wait, the original Declaration was recorded. The son's deed not being recordedâ€”does that affect anything? No, because the covenant was already on record. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: The son's business isn't a saloon or place for manufacturing. Well, selling wine from home might not be a saloon, but it's still selling liquor. So B could be a possible argument, but I'm not sure if it's the best. The covenant prohibits any structure used for sale of liquor, which could include a home-based business. So maybe B isn't the strongest.

Option C: Law prohibits fee simple determinable. Wait, the son's deed says "as long as used for residential purposes only." That sounds like a fee simple determinable, which would have a possibility of reverter. But the original covenant was a restrictive covenant, not a determinable fee. So maybe the son's deed created a fee simple determinable, which might be a different issue. But I'm not sure if that's the main point here.

Option D: The deed created a fee simple determinable, giving the psychologist the right to sue, not the geologist. So if the son's deed has a condition, then only the psychologist (the grantor) can enforce it, not a third party like the geologist. That sounds plausible. Because when you have a fee simple determinable, the right of reverter goes back to the grantor. So if the son violates the condition, the psychologist can take action, but other lot owners can't. So the geologist, as a neighboring owner, might not have standing to sue under that deed condition. But wait, the geologist is suing under the Declaration of Covenants, which is a separate issue.

Wait, but the geologist is part of the same community association, right? Because the Declaration of Covenants applies to all lots, so any owner can enforce it. So the geologist could enforce the covenant against the son regardless of the deed's conditions. So maybe D isn't the right answer because the geologist's suit is based on the covenant, not the deed's condition. Unless the son's deed's condition supersedes the covenant, but that seems unlikely.

Option E: Geologist can only get an injunction, not ejectment. Ejectment is for possession, while injunction stops the activity. So if the geologist is suing for ejectment, maybe that's not the right remedy. But I'm not sure if that's the best argument for the son. It's more about the remedy than the right to enforce.

Option G: Psychologist didn't forbid alcohol in the deed. But the original covenant did, and it's binding regardless of the subsequent deed. So G is probably not a good argument.

Option H: Geologist has no right because it doesn't affect him directly. But in covenant enforcement, any beneficiary can sue, especially in equitable servitudes. So H is probably wrong.

Option I: The prohibition doesn't apply because the son didn't purchase the lot. But the son is the current owner, so he's bound by the covenant. So I is incorrect.

Wait, going back to option D. The son's deed says "as long as used for residential purposes only." That's a fee simple determinable. So the psychologist has the right to enforce that condition. But the geologist is suing based on the Declaration of Covenants, not the son's deed. So the geologist's action is based on the covenant, which is a separate issue. So D might not apply here. Unless the son's deed's condition somehow replaces the covenant, but that doesn't make sense because the covenant is already part of the land.

So the best argument for the son would be option B, arguing that his business isn't a saloon or place for manufacture. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, option D could be applicable if the geologist is trying to enforce the condition in the son's deed, but I think the geologist is enforcing the covenant, which is a different matter.

Wait, maybe the son's deed's condition is a fee simple determinable, which gives the psychologist the right to enforce, not the geologist. So if the geologist is suing, he can't enforce the condition in the son's deed because that right is held by the psychologist. But the geologist can still enforce the Declaration of Covenants as a separate covenant. So D might not be the best argument in this case.

Hmm. Maybe the best argument is B, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the son's business doesn't violate the covenant. Because selling wine from home might not be considered a "saloon" or a place for sale in the way the covenant intended. So B could be a valid defense.

Alternatively, since the son's deed wasn't recorded, does that affect the enforceability? No, because the original covenant was recorded. The son's failure to record doesn't change his obligation under the existing covenant.

So perhaps the best argument is B. The son's business doesn't qualify as prohibited under the covenant.

Wait, but another angle: the covenant is an equitable servitude, so the geologist has the right to enforce it. The son is bound by it regardless of his knowledge. So the son can't argue that he didn't know. So F is out. So the son's best argument is B, that his use doesn't violate the covenant.

Alternatively, D says that the son's deed created a fee simple determinable, giving the psychologist, not the geologist, the right to sue. So if the geologist is suing, he can't enforce the condition in the son's deed because that right is with the psychologist. But the geologist is suing based on the Declaration, so D might not apply.

Wait, but the geologist's claim is based on the Declaration of Covenants, not the son's deed. So D is about the son's deed's condition, which is a separate issue. So the geologist's suit isn't affected by D. Therefore, D isn't the best argument.

So back to B: the son's business isn't a saloon or a place for sale. If the covenant prohibits structures used for sale, but the son is selling from his home, which is a residential structure, then maybe it's allowed. Or is it prohibited? The covenant says any structure used for sale. So a home used for that purpose would violate it. So B might not hold.

Hmm. Maybe the best argument is D. Because the son's deed condition gives the psychologist the right to enforce, not the geologist. So the geologist can't sue based on the son's deed condition. But the geologist is suing based on the covenant, which is a different matter. So D doesn't prevent the geologist from suing under the covenant. So maybe the best argument is B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the son's deed says "as long as used for residential purposes only." That's a determinable fee. So the condition is that it must be used residentially. If the son violates that, the psychologist can take action. But the geologist isn't a party to that deed, so he can't enforce that condition. So if the geologist is trying to enforce the condition in the son's deed, he can't. But the geologist is suing under the Declaration, which is a different covenant.

Ah, this is getting complicated. So the geologist's suit is based on the Declaration, which is an equitable servitude. So the son is bound by it regardless of his deed's conditions. So the best argument the son has is that his business doesn't violate the covenant (option B), or perhaps that the geologist can't enforce the condition in the son's deed (option D), but the geologist is enforcing the Declaration.

Wait, but the Declaration was given to the psychologist when he bought the lot, and the son is now the owner. The covenant runs with the land, so the son is bound. So the only possible defenses are that the use doesn't violate the covenant (option B) or that the covenant wasn't properly enforceable against him for another reason.

If the son's business is selling wine from home, that would fall under "sale of liquors," which the covenant prohibits. So B might not be a good argument. Alternatively, if the business is considered a home occupation that's allowed under the covenant, but the covenant explicitly prohibits any structure used for sale. So perhaps B isn't the best.

Wait, maybe the son's use is not a "structure" as per the covenant. The covenant prohibits structures, but the son is using the existing home. So the existing home isn't a structure erected for that purpose. So maybe the covenant doesn't apply because the structure (the house) was already there and is being used for a prohibited purpose. Hmm, I'm not sure. The covenant says any part of the property can't have a structure used for sale. So even if the house is used for that, it's a violation.

So perhaps the son's best argument is D: that the deed condition gives the psychologist the right, not the geologist. But since the geologist is suing under the Declaration, this might not apply. So the son can argue that the geologist has no right to enforce the condition in the son's deed, but the geologist is enforcing the Declaration.

Wait, maybe another angle: the Declaration of Covenants was included in the psychologist's deed, but when he conveyed the lot to his son, the deed didn't mention it. But the Declaration was already recorded, so it's binding regardless. So the son is still subject to it.

So the son's best argument would be that his business doesn't violate the covenant. So option B.

Alternatively, maybe the condition in the son's deed (residential use only) is a separate covenant, but the Declaration's covenant is still in effect. So the son has to comply with both. 

I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about which options are clearly incorrect.

Option A is incorrect because the Declaration was recorded, so it's enforceable against the son regardless of his deed.

Option C is about fee simple determinable being prohibited, which isn't the case. Fee simple determinable is allowed.

Option E: the geologist is entitled only to an injunction. But in an action for ejectment, the remedy is possession. However, for covenants, the remedy is usually injunction, not ejectment. So maybe the geologist can't get ejectment, only an injunction. So option E could be a good argument, but the question is about the best argument for the son.

Wait, if the geologist is suing for ejectment, which is a possessory action, but the appropriate remedy for a covenant violation is an injunction. So maybe the son can argue that the geologist can't get ejectment, only an injunction. So option E would be the best argument.

But I'm not sure if that's the strongest argument. The geologist is a neighboring property owner, so he has the right to enforce the covenant. But the remedy might be limited to injunction, not ejectment. So if the son can argue that the geologist can't get possession, only stop the use, that might be a good point.

So comparing options B and E. If the son's business violates the covenant, then E might not help him, because the geologist could still get an injunction. But if the son's business doesn't violate the covenant, then B would be the argument.

Alternatively, perhaps the son's business doesn't violate the covenant because it's not a "structure" built for that purpose, but that seems unlikely.

I think the best argument for the son is that the geologist can only get an injunction, not ejectment. So the answer would be E.

Wait, but the question is which is the best argument for the son. If the son is arguing that the geologist can't get him evicted, but only stop the activity, that's a valid point. So option E might be the best.

Alternatively, the son could argue that the geologist lacks standing, but that's option H, which I think is incorrect because the geologist is part of the same community and can enforce the covenant.

So I'm torn between B, D, and E. But considering the remedies, E seems like a strong point. The geologist can't get possession; he can only get an injunction to stop the activity.

So I think the best answer is E.

The question revolves around a property dispute involving a Declaration of Covenants that prohibits the use of any structure for the sale or manufacture of liquor. The son, who inherited lot 24, began selling wine from his home, prompting a neighboring geologist to sue for ejectment. The task is to identify the best argument for the son.

### Key Analysis of Options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The Declaration of Covenants was recorded, making it enforceable against the son regardless of whether his deed mentioned it or was recorded. The son is still bound by the covenant.

- **Option B**: The son's business involves selling wine from his home, which likely violates the covenant prohibiting the use of any structure for the sale of liquor. While the son might argue that his business does not qualify as a "saloon," the covenant broadly prohibits any structure used for the sale of liquor, which would include his home-based business. Thus, this argument is weak.

- **Option C**: Incorrect. Fee simple determinable is a valid estate in land and is not prohibited by law. This option is irrelevant to the son's situation.

- **Option D**: The son's deed includes a condition that the property must be used for residential purposes only, creating a fee simple determinable. This gives the psychologist, as the grantor, the right to enforce the condition, not the geologist. However, the geologist is suing based on the Declaration of Covenants, which is a separate issue. Therefore, this argument does not directly address the geologist's claim under the covenant.

- **Option E**: The geologist is seeking ejectment, which is a possessory remedy. However, the appropriate remedy for a covenant violation is typically an injunction to stop the prohibited use, not ejectment. This is a strong argument for the son, as it challenges the remedy sought by the geologist rather than the enforceability of the covenant itself.

- **Option F**: Incorrect. The son's lack of knowledge about the covenant does not exempt him from its terms, as the covenant was recorded and binds all subsequent owners.

- **Option G**: Incorrect. The psychologist's deed to the son did not explicitly forbid the sale of alcohol, but the original Declaration of Covenants, which was recorded and included in the psychologist's deed, already prohibited such use. The son is still bound by the covenant.

- **Option H**: Incorrect. The geologist, as a neighboring property owner, has standing to enforce the covenant under the Declaration of Covenants, as it benefits all lots in the development.

- **Option I**: Incorrect. The son, as the current owner of the lot, is bound by the covenant regardless of whether he purchased the lot or inherited it.

### Conclusion:
The best argument for the son is **Option E**, as it challenges the remedy sought by the geologist. The geologist is entitled to an injunction to stop the son's prohibited use but cannot seek ejectment, which is an inappropriate remedy for a covenant violation.
