Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the boundary layer thickness on a flat plate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on fluid mechanics, but let me think through this.

The question says a stream of air is flowing over a flat plate at 33 ft/sec. The conditions are atmospheric pressure and 60°F. I need to find the boundary layer thickness at 4 inches from the leading edge.

First, I remember that boundary layer thickness is related to Reynolds number. Oh right, the formula for the boundary layer thickness δ is something like δ = (x * Re_x^(-1/2)) * some constant. Wait, I think the formula is δ = (5*x)/(Re^(1/2)) ), but I might be mixing it up.

Wait no, the exact formula for laminar flow boundary layer thickness is δ = (4.64 x) / sqrt(Re_x), where Re_x is the Reynolds number at distance x. Oh wait, but wait, that's for the laminar boundary layer. But wait, what's the Reynolds number here?

Oh, right, the Reynolds number Re = (u * L * rho) / mu, where u is the fluid velocity, L is the characteristic length (here, x), rho is density, mu is dynamic viscosity.

But wait, the fluid here is air. So I need the properties of air at 60°F and atmospheric pressure. I'm pretty sure at atmospheric pressure and 60°F, the kinematic viscosity of air is around 0.00016 ft²/s. Wait, but I should double-check that.

Wait, kinematic viscosity ν = mu / rho. Hmm, alternatively, I could look up the values. Let me think: at 20°C (which is about 68°F), air's kinematic viscosity is about 1.5e-5 m²/s, but wait, the units here are in feet and inches, so maybe I should convert.

Wait, the given data is in feet, inches, and Fahrenheit. So I'll work in imperial units.

I think the kinematic viscosity ν for air at 60°F is approximately 0.00016 ft²/s. Let me confirm that. Oh, wait, I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, maybe it's 0.00017 or 0.00015. Hmm, but for this problem, I'll proceed with 0.00016 ft²/s.

So, the velocity u is given as 33 ft/s. The distance x from the leading edge is 4 inches. Oh wait, I have to convert that to feet because the units must be consistent. 4 inches is 4/12 = 0.333... feet, which is 1/3 foot.

So Re_x is (u * x) / ν. Plugging in the numbers:

u = 33 ft/s
x = 0.3333 ft
ν = 0.00016 ft²/s

So Re_x = (33 * 0.3333) / 0.00016.

Let me calculate that. 33 * 0.3333 is about 11. So 11 / 0.00016. Let me do the division: 11 / 0.00016 = 68,750. So Re_x is 68,750.

Wait, but wait, the critical Reynolds number for laminar flow is around 500,000. Since 68,750 is way below that, the flow is definitely laminar. So the formula I mentioned earlier applies.

The formula for the boundary layer thickness in laminar flow is δ = (4.64 x) / sqrt(Re_x). So let's plug in the numbers.

x is 0.3333 feet.

Re_x is 68,750.

So sqrt(Re_x) is sqrt(68750). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(68750) is approximately 262.38. Because 262^2 is 68,644, which is close to 68,750. So 262.38 is a good approximation.

So δ = (4.64 * 0.3333) / 262.38.

Calculating numerator: 4.64 * 0.3333 ≈ 1.54667.

So δ ≈ 1.54667 / 262.38 ≈ 0.005896 feet.

Wait, but the question asks for inches. So I need to convert feet to inches. 1 foot is 12 inches, so 0.005896 ft * 12 in/ft = 0.07075 inches.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.0708 in. That's very close to my calculation. So the answer should be J.

Alternatively, let me double-check my calculations. Oh, wait, I approximated sqrt(68,750) as 262.38. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 262^2=68644, 263^2=69169. 68750-68644= 106. So 262 + 106/(2*262 +1) ≈ 262 + 106/(525) ≈ 262 + 0.2019 ≈ 262.2019. So sqrt(68750)≈ 262.2019.

So let me recalculate δ.

4.64 * (1/3) = 4.64 /3 ≈ 1.5466667.

1.5466667 / 262.2019 ≈ let me compute that. 1.5466667 ÷ 262.2019.

Let me use a calculator approach.

262.2019 * 0.0059 = let's see: 262.2019 *0.005=1.3110095, 0.0009*262.2019=0.2359817. So 1.3110095 +0.2359817≈1.547. So 0.0059 gives approximately 1.547, which is our numerator. So δ is approximately 0.0059 ft, which is 0.0708 inches.

Yes, so option J is correct.

To calculate the boundary layer thickness on a flat plate at 4 inches from the leading edge, we use the formula for laminar boundary layer thickness:

\[
\delta = \frac{4.64 x}{\sqrt{\text{Re}_x}}
\]

where \( \text{Re}_x \) is the Reynolds number at distance \( x \), given by:

\[
\text{Re}_x = \frac{u x}{\nu}
\]

### Step 1: Convert units
- Velocity \( u = 33 \, \text{ft/s} \)
- Distance \( x = 4 \, \text{inches} = \frac{4}{12} = 0.3333 \, \text{ft} \)
- Kinematic viscosity of air at 60°F and atmospheric pressure is approximately \( \nu = 0.00016 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s} \).

### Step 2: Calculate Reynolds number
\[
\text{Re}_x = \frac{u x}{\nu} = \frac{33 \cdot 0.3333}{0.00016}
\]

\[
\text{Re}_x = \frac{11}{0.00016} = 68,750
\]

Since \( \text{Re}_x < 500,000 \), the flow is laminar, and the formula for \( \delta \) applies.

### Step 3: Calculate boundary layer thickness
\[
\delta = \frac{4.64 x}{\sqrt{\text{Re}_x}}
\]

Substitute \( x = 0.3333 \, \text{ft} \) and \( \sqrt{\text{Re}_x} = \sqrt{68,750} \approx 262.38 \):

\[
\delta = \frac{4.64 \cdot 0.3333}{262.38}
\]

\[
\delta \approx \frac{1.54667}{262.38} \approx 0.005896 \, \text{ft}
\]

Convert \( \delta \) to inches:

\[
\delta = 0.005896 \, \text{ft} \cdot 12 \, \text{in/ft} \approx 0.07075 \, \text{in}
\]

### Final Answer
The boundary layer thickness is approximately \( 0.0708 \, \text{in} \), which corresponds to option **J**.
