Question:

A rancher is the owner of a ranch that is situated upon the top of a mountain. Located below the ranch is an estate that is owned by a millionaire. A stream is a non-navigable watercourse that originates at the top of the mountain and runs all the way down into a valley. Both the ranch and the estate are within the watershed of the stream. When the millionaire purchased the estate in 1956, he started taking water from the stream and used it to irrigate the southern half of his property, which he has used as a farm. Prior to 1956, the southern half of the estate had been cleared and placed in cultivation, while the northern half remained wooded and virtually unused. The millionaire continued this established pattern of use and has never stopped using the water in this way. In 1986, the rancher built a home on the ranch and started talcing water from the stream for domestic purposes. During that year there was heavy rainfall, and this caused the stream to run down the mountain at a high water level. However, in 1987, a drought caused the stream to flow at a very low level. Consequently, there was only enough water to irrigate the millionaire's farmland or, in the alternative, to supply all of the rancher's domestic water needs and one-quarter of the millionaire's irrigation requirements. The mountain is located in a jurisdiction where the period of prescription is 15 years. The rancher is continuing to take water for his personal needs and there is insufficient water to irrigate the estate. The millionaire then brings an appropriate action in 1996 to declare that his water rights to the stream are superior to those of the rancher. In addition, the millionaire moves to have the full flow of the stream passed to him, notwithstanding the effect it might have on the rancher. If this state follows the common law of riparian rights, but does not follow the doctrine of prior appropriation, judgment should be for whom?

Options:

A: The rancher, because the drought conditions give him priority access to the water.
B: The millionaire, as he was using the water first for his estate's needs.
C: The millionaire, because he has a right to the water for irrigation purposes.
D: Neither, because both have equal rights to the water as it runs through both of their properties.
E: The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.
F: The rancher, because the millionaire's use of the water is excessive and unnecessary.
G: The millionaire, because he obtained an easement by prescription to remove as much water as he may need.
H: The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.
I: The rancher, because as an upstream landowner, he would have superior rights to the water than a downstream owner.
J: The millionaire, because he has been using the water for a longer period of time.

Okay, so I need to figure out this water rights question. Let me start by understanding the scenario. 

We have a mountain with a ranch at the top and a millionaire's estate below. There's a stream that starts at the top and flows down. Both properties are in the same watershed. 

The millionaire bought his estate in 1956 and started using the stream water to irrigate the southern half, which was already being farmed. He's been doing this continuously since then. Then, in 1986, the rancher built a home and started taking water for domestic use. 

In 1987, there was a drought, so there's not enough water for both uses. The millionaire can't irrigate his land fully, and the rancher is using water for domestic needs. The millionaire sues in 1996 to assert his superior water rights.

The question is about who has the superior rights under common law riparian rights, not prior appropriation. So I need to remember the common law rules here.

Under riparian doctrine, generally, all landowners along a watercourse have the right to use the water, but there are some nuances. Each riparian owner has a right to the water, but they can't unreasonably interfere with others' use. So it's not strictly first in time, first in right, like prior appropriation. Instead, it's more about reasonable use.

But wait, I remember that under common law, when there's a water shortage, the priority might depend on the type of use. Like, domestic use is often considered more important than agricultural. So if the rancher is using it for domestic and the millionaire for irrigation, domestic might take precedence.

But wait, another angle is the concept of prescription. The period is 15 years. Prescription in water rights usually refers to acquiring a right through long-term use. If the millionaire has been using the water since 1956, that's over 40 years, which is way beyond the 15-year period. So he might have an easement by prescription. 

But under common law, does prescription apply in this way? Or is it about the reasonableness of the use and the priority of the use type?

Alternatively, the millionaire started using the water in 1956, and the rancher started in 1986. So the millionaire's use is prior in time. But under riparian, the timing isn't as crucial as under prior appropriation. Riparian is about the nature of the use as well.

Wait, but under common law, when a riparian owner diverts water for a beneficial use, that use is protected against later users only if it's reasonable. So if the millionaire was using it first, and the rancher started later, but the uses are both beneficial, how does that play out?

I think I remember that in times of scarcity, under riparian rights, each owner is entitled to a reasonable share. So it's not necessarily that one has priority over the other, but both can take what's reasonable. But the problem here is that there isn't enough for both. So the court might have to decide how to allocate.

But another point is that the millionaire has been using the water continuously since 1956, which is more than 15 years. So perhaps he has acquired an easement by prescription. Because prescription requires continuous, uninterrupted use for the prescriptive period (15 years here). So from 1956 to 1996 is 40 years, which is way over. So he has an easement to take as much as he needs, regardless of the rancher's later use.

Wait, but easement by prescription typically requires that the use was open, continuous, and without the owner's permission. In this case, the rancher owns the land where the stream originates. So the millionaire's use is taking water from the stream that flows through his own land (the estate). Wait, no. Wait, the stream is on the rancher's land at the top, and flows down to the millionaire's estate. So the rancher is upstream, the millionaire is downstream.

Wait, no, the ranch is at the top of the mountain, and the estate is below. So the stream starts on the ranch and flows down through the estate. So the rancher is the upstream riparian owner, and the millionaire is downstream. But under common law, the upstream owner can't divert water in a way that unreasonably affects the downstream owner's rights. But in this case, the question is about who has the superior right when there's a shortage.

Alternatively, since the millionaire started using the water in 1956, and has done so continuously for over 40 years, perhaps he has acquired a prescriptive right to the water. Because prescription under water rights would require that the use was adverse, continuous, and without permission for the prescriptive period. Here, the millionaire started using the water when he bought the estate, so he had ownership of the downstream part. Wait, but the water is on his own property as it flows through. So maybe he doesn't need prescription because he's a riparian owner. 

Wait, maybe I'm confusing things. Riparian rights are based on ownership of the land adjacent to the watercourse. So both the rancher and the millionaire are riparian owners. But the stream flows through the ranch first, then the estate. So the rancher is upstream, the millionaire is downstream.

Under common law, each riparian owner is entitled to the natural flow of the stream, but can make reasonable use. However, an upstream owner cannot completely divert the water to the detriment of a downstream owner. So in times of scarcity, both can take water, but subject to reasonableness.

But in this scenario, the millionaire has been using the water for irrigation since 1956, and the rancher started in 1986 for domestic. So the millionaire's use is more established. 

Wait, but domestic use is typically considered more senior than irrigation. So when there's a conflict, domestic use gets priority. So the rancher, using it for domestic, might have a superior claim.

But I thought that under common law, the priority isn't based on first in time but on the reasonableness and the type of use. So domestic use is protected over agricultural. So the rancher's domestic use would take precedence over the millionaire's irrigation.

But wait, the millionaire has been using it for a long time. Does that give him any rights beyond what's reasonable? Or does the type of use (domestic vs. irrigation) take precedence regardless of when each started?

I think under common law, when there's a conflict, the court looks at the reasonableness of each use and the purpose. Domestic use is considered more essential and therefore is given higher priority. So even if the millionaire started using it first, the rancher's domestic use would have priority during a drought.

But wait, another angle: the millionaire's use was established before the rancher's. So if the rancher started taking water in 1986, but the millionaire has been using it since 1956, perhaps the millionaire's use is considered senior. But under common law, it's not the same as prior appropriation. It's more about the nature of the use.

Alternatively, the period of prescription is 15 years. The millionaire used the water from 1956 to 1996, which is 40 years. That's more than the 15 required. So he might have an easement by prescription to take the water. But for prescription, the use needs to be without the owner's permission. Since the rancher is the upstream owner, and the millionaire is downstream, perhaps the millionaire's taking of water doesn't require the rancher's permission because it's his riparian right. So prescription might not apply here. Or does it?

Alternatively, maybe the millionaire's use is adverse. But I'm not sure. Prescription in water rights can be tricky. I think that prescription requires that the use was adverse, meaning without permission. But as a riparian owner, the millionaire has the right to use the water, so his use isn't adverse to the rancher. Therefore, he can't get prescription because he's just exercising his riparian rights.

So the key here is whether the type of use (domestic vs. irrigation) determines priority. If so, the rancher's domestic use would have priority. But another possibility is that the prior use in time, even under riparian, gives some priority, but I don't think so.

Wait, under common law, when a watercourse is used by multiple riparian owners, each is entitled to the water as it flows through their land in its natural state, but if the water is insufficient, the court may apportion it based on reasonable use. So it's not first come first served, but rather what's a reasonable use.

In times of scarcity, the court might prioritize domestic over agricultural. So the rancher's domestic use would be protected, and the millionaire's irrigation might be curtailed.

Looking at the options:

Option H says: The rancher, because domestic use is superior to and is protected against an agricultural use.

Option E says: The millionaire, because he put the water to a beneficial use prior to the rancher's use and has continuously used the water.

Wait, but the question is under common law riparian, not prior appropriation. So in prior appropriation, it's first in time, first in right. But here, it's riparian, so the type of use matters.

So the correct judgment should be for the rancher, because domestic use takes precedence over irrigation.

But wait, another thought: the period of prescription is 15 years. The millionaire used the water from 1956 to 1996, which is 40 years. That's more than 15. So could he have an easement by prescription? But for prescription, the use must be adverse. Since he's a riparian owner, his use is not adverse; he's just exercising his riparian rights. So prescription doesn't apply because it's not hostile to the rancher's interests.

So back to the main point: under riparian, in scarcity, domestic use is preferred. So the rancher's domestic use would have priority.

Looking at the options, option H says that. So the answer would be H.

Wait but another angle: the millionaire has been using the water for a longer time. Does that give him any priority? Under common law, the timing isn't as important as the nature of the use. So even if he started earlier, the type of use (domestic) is more senior.

So I think the correct answer is H.
</think>

Under the common law of riparian rights, all landowners along a watercourse have the right to use the water, but the use must be reasonable and not unreasonably interfere with others' rights. In times of scarcity, domestic use is generally prioritized over agricultural or irrigation use because it is considered more essential.

In this case, the millionaire began using the stream water for irrigation in 1956, while the rancher started using it for domestic purposes in 1986. Although the millionaire's use predates the rancher's, the type of use (domestic vs. irrigation) takes precedence under common law. Domestic use is protected as a higher priority than agricultural use, even if the agricultural use was established earlier.

The question of prescription does not apply here because the millionaire's use of the water as a riparian owner is not considered adverse; it is merely an exercise of his riparian rights. Therefore, the rancher's domestic use takes priority over the millionaire's irrigation use during the drought.

The correct judgment is for the rancher, as domestic use is superior to and protected against agricultural use under common law riparian rights.
