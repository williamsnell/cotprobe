Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about standardized residuals in a GARCH model. Hmm, I remember that GARCH models are used in finance to model volatility, right? They help predict how much a financial asset might fluctuate. But wait, the question is about the standardized residuals from an estimated GARCH model. 

The question gives four statements, i to iv, and I need to figure out which are true. Let me go through each one step by step.

Statement i says that the standardized residuals are assumed to be normally distributed. Wait, from what I remember, GARCH models often assume that the residuals (or the errors) follow a normal distribution. But wait, isn't that an assumption for the model estimation? So when we standardize them (residuals divided by their conditional standard deviations), the standardized residuals should have a mean of zero and a variance of one, but their distribution is assumed to be normal. So statement i should be true.

Statement ii claims that their squares are related to their lagged squared values if the GARCH model is appropriate. Hmm, the GARCH model is all about how the squared residuals (which represent volatility) are predicted by past squared residuals and past variances. So if the model is appropriate, then the standardized residuals' squares shouldn't have any remaining patterns. Wait, no. Wait, the model uses lagged squared residuals to predict current variance. So in the standardized residuals, the squares should not be correlated anymore because the GARCH model has already captured that. Or wait, no, because statement ii is saying that if the model is appropriate, their squares will be related to their lagged squared values. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again. 

Wait, in the original model setup, the variance equation uses past squared residuals. So if the model is correctly specified, then the standardized residuals should have no autocorrelation in their squares. So if you look at the Ljung-Box test on the squared standardized residuals, you shouldn't find any significant autocorrelation. So statement ii says that their squares are related to lagged squared values, implying that there is a relationship. But if the model is appropriate, that relationship should have been accounted for, so I don't think the residuals should show this. So statement ii might be false. Wait, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps statement ii is referring to the original model structure, not the residuals. Because in the model, the current variance depends on past squared residuals, so the GARCH model is capturing that relationship. So in the standardized residuals, which are the raw residuals divided by the model's estimated standard deviations, their squares shouldn't show any patterns. So statement ii is saying that if the model is appropriate, the squared standardised residuals will have a relationship with their lagged values. That doesn't sound right because a good model would remove that relationship. So I think statement ii is false.

Wait, but maybe the statement is saying that the model uses lagged squared residuals, so the standardized residuals' squares are related to lagged values. But that's part of the model, not the residuals. So perhaps statement ii is correct because the model is based on that relationship, so the residuals would reflect that. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me come back to this after looking at the other statements.

Statement iii says that in practice, the standardized residuals are likely to have fat tails. I remember that even after fitting a GARCH model, the standardized residuals can still exhibit some leptokurtosis, meaning fat tails. Because while the model accounts for time-varying volatility, it doesn't necessarily capture all the extreme events, so the residuals might still have heavier tails than a normal distribution. So statement iii is true.

Statement iv claims that if the GARCH model is adequate, the standardized residuals and raw residuals are identical. Wait, that doesn't make sense. The raw residuals are the original errors (estimated as the difference between observed and predicted values). The standardized residuals are raw residuals divided by the estimated conditional standard deviations. So if the model is adequate, the standardized residuals should have unit variance, but they wouldn't be the same as the raw residuals unless the conditional variance is constant, which isn't the case in GARCH. So statement iv is false.

Now, back to statement ii. So the question is whether the standardized residuals' squares are related to their lagged squared values if the GARCH model is appropriate. If the model is appropriate, I think the squared standardized residuals should not have any significant autocorrelation. Because the GARCH model has already accounted for the volatility clustering, so the residuals shouldn't show the kind of patterns that the model is designed to capture. So statement ii says that the squares are related, implying that there is autocorrelation, which would suggest that the model isn't capturing everything. Therefore, statement ii is false.

Wait, but another angle: the model's specification includes terms like lagged squared residuals. So in the model, the current variance depends on past squared residuals. Therefore, when you standardize the residuals, the model has used those past squares to compute the current standard deviation. So the standardized residuals would not have any remaining relationship between their squares and lagged squares. So statement ii is saying that if the model is appropriate, the squares are related. But that's not the case; a good model would eliminate that. So statement ii is false.

So, summarizing:

i: True
ii: False
iii: True
iv: False

So which statements are correct? i and iii are correct, and ii and iv are incorrect.

Looking at the options, option E is (i) and (iii) only. So the correct answer should be option E.

To determine which statements about the standardized residuals from an estimated GARCH model are true, let us analyze each statement:

1. **Statement i**: "They are assumed to be normally distributed."  
   GARCH models often assume that the residuals follow a normal distribution, and this assumption is typically extended to the standardized residuals. Therefore, this statement is **true**.

2. **Statement ii**: "Their squares will be related to their lagged squared values if the GARCH model is appropriate."  
   The GARCH model is designed to capture volatility clustering by relating current variance to past squared residuals. If the model is appropriate, the standardized residuals should not exhibit any significant autocorrelation in their squares, as the model has already accounted for this relationship. Therefore, this statement is **false**.

3. **Statement iii**: "In practice, they are likely to have fat tails."  
   Even after fitting a GARCH model, standardized residuals often exhibit leptokurtosis (fat tails) in practice, as the model does not always capture all extreme events. Therefore, this statement is **true**.

4. **Statement iv**: "If the GARCH model is adequate, the standardized residuals and the raw residuals will be identical."  
   Standardized residuals are the raw residuals divided by their respective conditional standard deviations. Even if the GARCH model is adequate, the standardized residuals will not be identical to the raw residuals unless the conditional variance is constant, which is not typically the case. Therefore, this statement is **false**.

Based on this analysis, the correct statements are **(i)** and **(iii)**. The correct answer is:

**E: (i) and (iii) only.**
