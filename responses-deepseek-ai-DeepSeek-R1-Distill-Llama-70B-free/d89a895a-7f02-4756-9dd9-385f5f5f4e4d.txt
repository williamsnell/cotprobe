Question:

A previously healthy 17-year-old girl comes to the emergency department because of a 5-day history of progressive lower abdominal pain, fever, and malodorous vaginal discharge. Menarche was at the age of 12 years, and her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses a combination contraceptive patch. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows severe lower quadrant tenderness bilaterally. Pelvic examination shows a purulent cervical discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness. Her hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 13,000/mm3 , and platelet count is 345,000/mm3 . A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?

Options:

A: Oral azithromycin
B: Vaginal clindamycin
C: Intravenous penicillin and vancomycin
D: Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline

Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The patient is a 17-year-old girl who comes to the emergency department with a 5-day history of progressive lower abdominal pain, fever, and malodorous vaginal discharge. She's otherwise healthy and has been having regular menstrual cycles since menarche at 12. Her last period was two weeks ago. She's sexually active with one male partner and uses a contraceptive patch, which I think is a form of hormonal contraception, probably ethinyl estradiol and a progestin.

Her vital signs are: temperature 37.8°C, which is a low-grade fever; pulse is 90, which is slightly elevated; respirations 22, which is a bit high but not too bad; and blood pressure is 110/70, which is normal. On physical exam, she has severe lower quadrant tenderness bilaterally. The pelvic exam shows purulent cervical discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness. 

Her lab work shows a hemoglobin of 10.5, which is a bit low (normal is around 12-16 for women), leukocyte count (WBC) is 13,000, which is elevated (normal is 4,000-10,000), and platelets are 345,000, which is normal. The urine pregnancy test is negative, so she's not pregnant.

The question is about the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for her condition. The options are A through D, each with different antibiotics.

Hmm. So, what's the likely diagnosis here? She's presenting with lower abdominal pain, fever, purulent cervical discharge, and cervical motion tenderness. These symptoms suggest pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the female reproductive organs that often results from sexually transmitted bacteria, most commonly Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. 

Other causes could be considered, like appendicitis or an ectopic pregnancy, but the negative pregnancy test makes ectopic less likely. Appendicitis can sometimes present with lower quadrant pain, but the presence of cervical discharge and adnexal tenderness point more towards PID.

So, PID is the likely diagnosis. The treatment for PID typically involves antibiotics that cover both gonorrhea and chlamydia, as well as possible other pathogens. The CDC guidelines recommend several treatment regimens, usually a combination of a cephalosporin (like ceftriaxone) plus doxycycline. 

Looking at the options:

A: Oral azithromycin. Azithromycin is used for chlamydia and sometimes as part of PID treatment, but usually in combination with other antibiotics. Also, if given alone, it might not cover all possible pathogens, especially gonorrhea, which may require a cephalosporin.

B: Vaginal clindamycin. Clindamycin is an option for bacterial vaginosis, but this patient's symptoms are more indicative of PID, not just vaginitis. Also, PID requires systemic antibiotics, not just vaginal.

C: IV penicillin and vancomycin. Those are typically used for more severe infections, like endocarditis or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. They wouldn't be the first choice for PID, which is more often caused by gram-negative bacteria and chlamydia.

D: IM ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline. This fits with the CDC recommendations. Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin effective against gonorrhea, and doxycycline covers chlamydia and other possible bacteria. This combination is a standard first-line treatment for PID.

So the correct answer should be D.

The patient is a 17-year-old girl presenting with symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), including lower abdominal pain, fever, purulent cervical discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness. PID is most commonly caused by sexually transmitted infections such as *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* and *Chlamydia trachomatis*. The diagnosis is supported by her clinical presentation, elevated leukocyte count, and negative pregnancy test, which rules out ectopic pregnancy.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend treating PID with antibiotics that cover both *N. gonorrhoeae* and *C. trachomatis*. The standard first-line regimen is intramuscular (IM) ceftriaxone (a cephalosporin effective against gonorrhea) and oral doxycycline (which covers chlamydia and other potential pathogens). This combination is appropriate because it addresses the most likely causative organisms and aligns with current treatment guidelines.

- **Option A (Oral azithromycin):** While azithromycin is effective against chlamydia, it is not sufficient alone for PID, as it does not reliably cover *N. gonorrhoeae*.  
- **Option B (Vaginal clindamycin):** Clindamycin is used for bacterial vaginosis, not PID, and systemic antibiotics are required for PID.  
- **Option C (IV penicillin and vancomycin):** These antibiotics are more appropriate for infections like endocarditis or methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA), not PID.  
- **Option D (IM ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline):** This is the CDC-recommended regimen for PID, providing broad coverage for both *N. gonorrhoeae* and *C. trachomatis*.  

Thus, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is **intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline**.

Answer: D
