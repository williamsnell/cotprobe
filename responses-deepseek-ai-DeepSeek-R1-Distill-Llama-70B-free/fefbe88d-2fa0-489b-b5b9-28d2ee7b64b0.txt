Answer:
    <think>
<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about slander. Let me start by recalling what I know about defamation, which includes both slander and libel. I remember that libel is written defamation, while slander is spoken. So, looking at the options, option B says it's spoken defamation, which I think is correct. So B is true, meaning it's not the answer we're looking for since the question asks which is not true.

The question is asking which statement is not true about slander. So I need to find the incorrect statement among the options.

Option A: The accused must have intentionally spread the false statement. Hmm, I think for slander, there's something about negligence. Wait, I remember that in some cases, like slander per se, the plaintiff doesn't have to prove special damages, but for regular slander, they do. But does the speaker have to intend to harm? Or is it enough that they were negligent? I'm a bit fuzzy here. I think that for slander, the speaker must have acted with a certain level of intent, maybe at least negligence. So A might be true because it says "intentionally," but I'm not 100% sure.

Option C: There are four slander per se categories. Yes, I remember there are specific categories where damages are presumed. They include things like accusing someone of a crime of moral turpitude, having a loathsome disease, affecting someone's professional reputation, or serious sexual misconduct. So four categories, making C true.

Option D: Slander is less serious than libel. I think that's correct. Libel is generally considered more serious because written statements can be more permanent and widespread. So D is true.

Option E: Plaintiff has to prove special damages unless it's slander per se. Yes, that's right. In regular slander cases, you need to show actual monetary loss (special damages), but in slander per se, general damages are presumed. So E is true.

Option F: The statement doesn't have to be published if it's slander per se. Wait, publication in slander refers to a third party hearing it. So in slander per se, I think publication is still required because the defamatory statement must be communicated to a third person. Otherwise, it's just a statement between two people, which doesn't count. So F says the statement doesn't have to be published, which would be false. That might be the incorrect statement.

Option G: Slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove emotional distress. I don't think that's correct. Emotional distress is part of damages, but slander per se allows for damages without proving specific harm. Also, in some cases, general damages might include emotional distress. But I'm not sure if it's a requirement for slander to apply. I think the key is that slander per se allows for presumed damages, so even without proving emotional distress, you can get damages. So G might not be true because slander can be applicable even without proving emotional distress, especially in per se cases.

Wait, but the question is which option is not true. So looking back:

Option F says the statement does not have to be published if it's slander per se. But in reality, for slander, the statement must be spoken to a third party (published) regardless. So F is incorrect because publication is required even in slander per se cases.

Wait, but I thought publication refers to communication to a third party, which is required for slander. So in slander per se, you still need publication. So F is false, making it the correct answer.

Alternatively, option G says slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove emotional distress. But I think slander doesn't require that. In slander per se, you don't have to prove special damages, which include things like emotional distress. So G is incorrect because slander can be actionable without proving emotional distress.

Hmm, now I'm a bit confused between F and G.

Wait, let me clarify: For slander, the statement must be published (communicated to a third party) to be actionable. So F says the statement doesn't have to be published if it's per se. That's not correct because publication is always required. So F is false, making it the answer.

But wait, option G: does slander require proof of emotional distress? I think no. In slander, you can have cases where you don't have to prove special damages (like slander per se), so you don't necessarily have to show emotional distress. So G is not a true statement because slander can be applicable without proving emotional distress.

So both F and G seem incorrect, but I need to choose the one that's not true.

Wait, the question is which is NOT TRUE about slander. So which of these options is false.

So let's re-express the options:

F: The statement does not have to be published if it constitutes slander per se.

But in reality, even in slander per se, the statement must be published (i.e., heard by a third party). So F is false.

G: Slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove emotional distress.

But slander can be applicable without proving emotional distress, especially in slander per se cases where damages are presumed. So G is also false.

Wait, this is confusing. Which one is the correct answer?

Wait, the answer options are A to G, and the question is which is not true about slander.

Looking back, the options:

The correct answer is either F or G.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

In slander, whether per se or per quod, the statement must be published. So F says the statement doesn't have to be published if it's per se. That's incorrect; publication is required regardless. So F is false.

G says that slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove emotional distress. But in slander per se, the plaintiff doesn't have to prove special damages, which would include emotional distress. So G's statement is incorrect because slander can be actionable without proving emotional distress.

Wait, but option E says that the plaintiff has to prove special damages unless it's slander per se. So E is correct.

So, G is saying that slander applies only if emotional distress is proven. But that's not true because in slander per se, you don't have to prove it. So G is incorrect.

So now I'm torn between F and G. Which one is the incorrect statement about slander.

The question is which option is NOT TRUE about slander. So which one is a false statement.

Wait, the question is multiple choice, so I can look for the correct answer.

Let me list the options again:

A: Accused must have intentionally spread the false statement.

I think for slander, the speaker must have been at least negligent, but maybe not necessarily intentional. Or perhaps in some cases, like slander per se, intent isn't required. Wait, no, I think in slander, the statement must have been spoken with a certain level of fault, which could be negligence. So maybe A is not necessarily true. Because the accused doesn't have to intend to harm, just to spread the statement negligently.

Wait, this complicates things. If A is not true, then perhaps A is the incorrect statement.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this methodically.

1. Slander is spoken defamation. So B is correct.

2. Slander per se has four categories. So C is correct.

3. Slander is less serious than libel. D is correct.

4. Unless slander per se, plaintiff must prove special damages. So E is correct.

5. For slander per se, does the statement have to be published? Yes, because slander requires communication to a third party. So F is incorrect because it says it doesn't have to be published, which is false.

6. Must prove emotional distress? No, because in slander per se, damages are presumed. So G is incorrect.

So both F and G are incorrect statements. But the options don't have both as correct answers. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, the options are A-G, but the question is which is not true, so only one is correct as the answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding option G. Option G says: "Slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove they suffered emotional distress." But slander can be actionable without proving emotional distress, especially in per se cases. So G is incorrect.

But the question is which option is NOT true about slander. So the incorrect statement is the one that's false.

So which of the options is false.

Looking again:

A: The accused must have intentionally spread the false statement.

Is this true? Or can it be done negligently?

I think that in slander, the speaker's statement can be based on negligence, not necessarily intent. So A is not correct because the speaker doesn't have to intentionally spread it; negligence suffices. So A is a false statement about slander.

Wait, that's a possibility. So if A is false, then it's the correct answer.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me think about the elements of slander.

The elements of slander are:

1. False statement of fact.

2. About the plaintiff.

3. Published to a third party.

4. Which caused harm.

5. The speaker acted with a certain level of fault (negligence or higher, depending on the situation).

So, for slander, the speaker doesn't have to intend to harm, just to be negligent in making the false statement. So A says the accused must have intentionally spread it, which would be incorrect because negligence is enough. So A is a false statement about slander, making it the correct answer.

But earlier, I thought F and G were incorrect.

Wait, so which is it? Let me try to clarify each option.

Option A: Must have intentionally spread the false statement.

If the rule is that negligence is enough, then A is false, making it the correct answer.

Option F: Statement doesn't have to be published if it's slander per se.

But publication is required for slander, regardless of per se or not. So F is false.

Option G: Slander only applicable if plaintiff proves emotional distress.

But in slander per se, you don't have to prove emotional distress, so G is false.

So now I see that A, F, and G could all be false, but that can't be right because the question expects only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each option again.

Option A: Must have intentionally spread.

No, because negligence is sufficient. So A is false.

Option F: Doesn't have to be published if per se.

No, because publication is required. So F is false.

Option G: Must prove emotional distress.

No, because in per se, you don't have to. So G is false.

So how come three options are false? That can't be. I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, the question is about which is NOT TRUE about slander. So which option is false.

Wait, perhaps not all of them are incorrect. Let me think again.

Option A says the accused must have intentionally spread the false statement. So is intent required?

In common law, slander required a higher level of fault, like malice, but in many jurisdictions, negligence is sufficient. So A is not necessarily true. So A is a false statement.

Option F: Statement doesn't have to be published if it's per se.

No, publication is required regardless, so F is false.

Option G: Must prove emotional distress.

No, because in per se cases, you don't have to. So G is false.

Wait, this is a problem because more than one option is false.

But the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering A. Maybe in slander, the speaker must have intended to spread the statement, but not necessarily with the intent to harm.

Wait, no, because if someone accidentally spreads a false statement, that could still be slander if they were negligent.

So A's statement is incorrect because intent isn't required, only negligence.

So perhaps the answer is A, F, or G.

But the options given are A through G, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on standard multiple-choice questions I've seen before.

I recall that for slander, publication (communication to a third party) is always required, so F is false.

I also remember that slander per se does not require proof of special damages, which includes emotional distress, so G is false.

Wait, but the question is which is not true about slander, so the answer would be the statement that is false.

If A is false, F is false, and G is false, but the options can't have three correct answers.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it step by step.

Which of the options is not true:

A: Accused must have intentionally spread the false statement.

In slander, the defendant must have been at least negligent, not necessarily intentional. So A is false.

B: It is spoken defamation. True.

C: Four categories of slander per se. True.

D: Slander less serious than libel. True.

E: Plaintiff must prove special damages unless per se. True.

F: Statement doesn't have to be published if per se. False.

G: Must prove emotional distress. False.

So A, F, G are all false statements. But the question expects only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me re-examine each.

Option G: Slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove they suffered emotional distress.

No, because in slander per se, you don't have to prove any special damages, including emotional distress. So G is false.

So the possible false options are A, F, G.

But the question is multiple-choice, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps option A is not necessarily false. Maybe in slander, the accused must have intended to make the statement, but not necessarily intended to harm. So A could be true.

Wait, the statement in A says "intentionally spread the false statement." So the intent is to spread the statement, not necessarily to cause harm. So perhaps A is true because the speaker must have intended to communicate the statement, even if they didn't intend to defame.

In that case, A would be true, not false.

So then, the incorrect options would be F and G.

But again, the question expects only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of which options are definitely correct.

Option B is correct: slander is spoken defamation.

Option C is correct: four categories.

Option D is correct: slander is less serious.

Option E is correct: unless per se, must prove special damages.

So among the options, A, F, G are the candidates for being incorrect.

But which one is the answer.

I think the most straightforward incorrect statement is F: the statement doesn't have to be published if it's per se. Because publication is always required, regardless of per se or not.

So F is the false statement.

Wait, but earlier I thought G was also false. But perhaps the answer is F.

Alternatively, if the answer is G, that would mean that slander requires proving emotional distress, which is not the case.

So now I'm stuck between F and G.

Wait, another approach: the question is asking which is not true about slander.

Looking for the false statement.

Option F: The statement does not have to be published if it constitutes slander per se.

This is false because publication is required for slander, whether per se or not.

Option G: Slander is only applicable if the plaintiff can prove they suffered emotional distress.

This is also false because in slander per se, emotional distress is presumed, so the plaintiff doesn't have to prove it.

So both F and G are false statements about slander.

But the options only have one correct answer. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in slander per se, publication is not required, but that doesn't make sense. No, publication is always required.

Wait, perhaps option F refers to 'publication' in the sense of being widely disseminated, but legally, publication in defamation means communication to a third party, which is required for slander regardless.

So F is false.

Similarly, G is false.

But since the question expects one answer, perhaps the intended answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps I remember that in slander, the statement must be spoken and published, but in libel, it's written and published.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the elements of slander.

Upon reviewing, to establish slander, the plaintiff must show:

1. A false statement of fact.

2. About the plaintiff.

3. Published to a third party.

4. Which caused harm.

5. The defendant was at fault (negligence or higher).

So publication (to a third party) is required, so F is false.

Emotional distress is not necessarily required because in slander per se, damages are presumed without proof of actual harm. So G is also false.

But the question is asking which option is not true about slander. So both F and G are false statements.

But since the options are multiple-choice, I must choose the one that the test considers correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G because it's more directly about damages, while F is about publication, which is a more fundamental element.

Wait, but the question is which is not true about slander. So F is not true because publication is required. G is also not true because emotional distress isn't required in per se cases.

But perhaps the answer is option G because it's more directly related to the damages, which is a common point of confusion.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the options again:

The question is, which is NOT true about slander.

Options:

A: Accused must have intentionally spread the statement.

I think this is false because negligence suffices, so A is not true.

But earlier I thought A might be true because the speaker must have intended to make the statement, not necessarily to defame.

Wait, perhaps A is true because the speaker must have intended to communicate the statement, even if they didn't realize it was false. So A is true.

If A is true, then the incorrect options are F and G.

But again, the question expects one answer.

Perhaps the intended answer is option G, as it's more clearly false.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F.

I'm getting too confused. Let me try to recall any past study.

In my previous studies, I remember that for slander per se, special damages are not required, but publication is still needed. So F is false.

Also, emotional distress isn't required in slander per se, making G false.

But since the question asks for which is not true, and the options are singular, perhaps the intended answer is F.

Wait, but I think the more accurate answer is F because it directly contradicts a fundamental element of slander, which is publication.

In that case, I think the answer is F.

But I'm not entirely sure. I might have to go with F as the answer.
</think>

To determine which statement is not true about slander, let's analyze each option:

1. **Option A**: "The accused must have intentionally spread the false statement for it to be considered slander."  
   This is **false** because slander only requires that the speaker acted negligently, not necessarily with intent to harm. Negligence suffices for slander.

2. **Option B**: "It is spoken defamation."  
   This is **true**. Slander is, by
