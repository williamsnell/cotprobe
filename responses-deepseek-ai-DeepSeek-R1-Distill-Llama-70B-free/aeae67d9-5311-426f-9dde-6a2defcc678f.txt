Question:

A 77-year-old man is brought to the physician because of a 12-hour history of word-finding difficulty and weakness and sensory loss of the right arm and leg. He has no history of similar symptoms. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Current medications include metformin, lisinopril, and aspirin. He is alert. His pulse is 80/min and irregular, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 170/90 mm Hg. He follows commands but has nonfluent aphasia. There is moderate weakness and decreased sensation of the right upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Babinski sign is present on the right. His serum glucose concentration is 162 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

Options:

A: Echocardiogram
B: Serum electrolyte test
C: CT scan of the head
D: Blood culture
E: Lumbar puncture
F: Carotid duplex ultrasonography
G: MRI of the spine
H: Chest X-ray
I: Thyroid function test
J: EEG

Okay, so I have this medical question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The patient is a 77-year-old man brought in with a 12-hour history of word-finding difficulty, weakness, and sensory loss in the right arm and leg. He has no history of similar symptoms before. His medical history includes type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. His medications are metformin, lisinopril, and aspirin. 

Upon examination, he's alert but has nonfluent aphasia. He has moderate weakness and decreased sensation in the right upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, and a Babinski sign is present on the right. His serum glucose is 162 mg/dL, which is a bit high but not super high. 

The question is asking for the most appropriate next diagnostic step. The options are A through J, each a different test.

I remember that in cases of sudden neurological deficits like this, the primary concern is a stroke, either ischemic or hemorrhagic. The symptoms he's presenting with—aphasia, right-sided weakness and sensory loss—suggest a left hemisphere lesion, possibly in the middle cerebral artery territory. 

His risk factors include atrial fibrillation, which is a major risk factor for ischemic strokes because it can lead to thrombus formation. His high blood pressure (170/90) is also a risk factor. The use of aspirin indicates he might be on antiplatelet therapy, but in atrial fibrillation, typically, warfarin or other anticoagulants are used, but he's on aspirin, which is less common now unless contraindicated.

Given that it's been 12 hours since symptoms started, I need to think about the time window for treatment. Ischemic strokes can sometimes be treated with tPA (tissue plasminogen activator) within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, but since it's 12 hours, that window has passed. However, other interventions like endovascular thrombectomy might still be an option if a large vessel occlusion is present, but that's usually considered earlier too. Anyway, the focus here is on diagnosis.

The next step after identifying stroke symptoms is usually imaging to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. The gold standard for acute stroke is a CT scan of the head. CT can quickly show whether there's bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke) or an ischemic area. MRI is more sensitive for early ischemic changes but isn't always as quick, especially in an emergency setting. Also, the CT scan is often more readily available in the acute setting.

Looking at the options, option C is a CT scan of the head. That makes sense because you need to rule out a hemorrhage before considering any anticoagulation or other treatments. Plus, it's standard in acute stroke assessment.

Other options: Echocardiogram (A) might be useful later to look for clots or atrial abnormalities, but not as the immediate next step. Serum electrolytes (B) are probably not the main issue here unless there's suspicion of electrolyte imbalance causing symptoms, but that's less likely. Blood cultures (D) would be for infection, which doesn't fit here. Lumbar puncture (E) is for meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage, but CT is done first. Carotid duplex (F) could assess for carotid artery stenosis but isn't the immediate next step in acute presentation. MRI of the spine (G) would be for spinal issues, which don't align with the symptoms. Chest X-ray (H) is not directly relevant here. Thyroid function (I) is unrelated. EEG (J) is for seizures, which he isn't presenting with.

So the most appropriate next step is a CT scan of the head, which is option C.

The patient is a 77-year-old man presenting with sudden word-finding difficulty, right-sided weakness, and sensory loss, suggestive of a stroke. His history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes increases his risk for ischemic stroke. Given the acute onset of symptoms, the primary concern is differentiating between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. 

The most appropriate next step is imaging. A CT scan of the head is the standard initial imaging modality in acute stroke because it quickly identifies hemorrhage and is readily available. While MRI is more sensitive for early ischemic changes, CT is preferred in the emergency setting. Other tests, such as echocardiogram or carotid duplex, may be considered later but are not the immediate next step.
