Okay, so I've got this question about spot rates and forward rates. Hmm, I remember that spot rates are the interest rates for borrowing or lending money with immediate delivery, right? And forward rates are the rates agreed upon today for a loan or deposit in the future. 

The question gives me two spot rates: the 1-year spot rate is 5%, and the 2-year spot rate is 6%. I need to find the one-year forward rate that starts one year from today. So, it's the rate for the period between year 1 and year 2.

I think the formula for the forward rate involves the spot rates. Let me try to remember. Oh right, the formula connects the spot rates and the forward rate. The general formula is (1 + r2)^2 = (1 + r1) * (1 + f), where r1 is the 1-year rate, r2 is the 2-year rate, and f is the forward rate for the second year.

Wait, that makes sense because the 2-year investment can be thought of as two consecutive one-year investments. The return from the 2-year spot rate should equal the return from investing at the 1-year rate and then rolling over into the forward rate for the next year.

So plugging the numbers in: r1 is 5%, which is 0.05, and r2 is 6%, which is 0.06. Let me write the equation:

(1 + 0.06)^2 = (1 + 0.05) * (1 + f)

Calculating the left side: 1.06 squared. Let me compute that. 1.06 * 1.06 is... 1.1236.

The right side is (1.05) times (1 + f). So,

1.1236 = 1.05 * (1 + f)

To solve for (1 + f), I'll divide both sides by 1.05.

1.1236 / 1.05 = 1 + f

Hmm, what's 1.1236 divided by 1.05? Let me calculate that. Let's see, 1.05 times 1.07 is 1.1235. Oh wait, because 1.05 * 1.07 = 1.05 + 0.075 = 1.125? Wait, no, I think I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, no, 1.05 * 1.07 is 1.1235. Because 1.05 * 1 = 1.05, 1.05 * 0.07 = 0.0735, adding them gives 1.1235. So 1.1236 is just a tiny bit more than that. So maybe 1.07 approximately, but let me do the exact calculation.

Alternatively, let me compute 1.1236 / 1.05.

1.1236 ÷ 1.05: Let's see, 1.05 goes into 1.1236 how many times?

1.05 * 1.07 = 1.1235, as before. So 1.1236 is 1.1235 + 0.0001. So 1.07 + (0.0001)/(1.05) ≈ 1.07 + 0.0000952. So approximately 1.070095.

Therefore, (1 + f) ≈ 1.070095, so f is approximately 0.070095, which is 7.0095%.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.070095, which is exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be A.

To determine the one-year forward rate between year 1 and year 2, we use the relationship between spot rates and forward rates. The formula is:

\[
(1 + r_2)^2 = (1 + r_1)(1 + f)
\]

Where:
- \( r_1 \) is the 1-year spot rate (5% or 0.05),
- \( r_2 \) is the 2-year spot rate (6% or 0.06),
- \( f \) is the forward rate.

Substituting the given values:

\[
(1 + 0.06)^2 = (1 + 0.05)(1 + f)
\]

First, calculate the left-hand side:

\[
(1.06)^2 = 1.1236
\]

Next, solve for \( (1 + f) \) by dividing both sides by \( 1.05 \):

\[
1 + f = \frac{1.1236}{1.05} \approx 1.070095
\]

Thus, \( f \approx 0.070095 \), or 7.0095%. Comparing this result to the options, the correct answer is:

**A: 0.070095**
