Question:

A 19-year-old Asian female college student comes to the university health center because of a 1-week history of nasal stuffiness, occasional clear rhinorrhea, and a mild sore throat. Two days ago, she began to feel hot, but she has not taken her temperature. Medical history is unremarkable and her only medication is an oral contraceptive. She has no history of allergies. She does not smoke cigarettes. BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse 88/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 116/74 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses tenderness over the left maxillary sinus without purulent drainage. There is clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, enlarged tonsils bilaterally, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors. Left frontal sinus does not transilluminate. Cardiopulmonary examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis?

Options:

A: Mucosal edema
B: Fungal infection
C: Bacterial infection
D: Chronic sinusitis
E: Oral contraceptive use
F: Viral infection
G: Allergic reaction
H: Immune system disorder
I: Nasal polyps
J: Eustachian tube dysfunction

Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The patient is a 19-year-old Asian female college student. She's come to the health center with symptoms that started a week ago. Her main complaints are nasal stuffiness, occasional clear rhinorrhea, and a mild sore throat. Two days ago, she felt hot but didn't take her temperature. Her medical history is unremarkable except for being on oral contraceptives. No history of allergies, doesn't smoke. Her BMI is 22, which is normal. 

Vital signs: temp is 38.1°C (which is about 100.6°F), so she's got a low-grade fever. Pulse is 88, which is within normal range. Respirations 16, BP 116/74, all normal.

Physical exam findings: Tenderness over the left maxillary sinus. No purulent drainage. Clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane suggests maybe some Eustachian tube issue or sinusitis affecting the middle ear. Enlarged tonsils bilaterally could indicate infection or inflammation. Pain when tapping the left upper incisors—oh, that's probably sinus pressure because the upper teeth are near the maxillary sinuses. The left frontal sinus doesn't transilluminate, which implies it's filled with something, maybe fluid or infection. Cardiopulmonary exam is normal, so probably nothing wrong there.

The question is about the underlying mechanism of her sinusitis. The options are A through J, each a different possible cause or mechanism.

So, sinusitis can be acute or chronic, and caused by various factors. The key here is to figure out whether it's bacterial, viral, allergic, etc.

Let's think about her symptoms. She has a week-long history starting with nasal stuffiness and clear rhinorrhea. Clear rhinorrhea often points to a viral infection or allergies. But she has no history of allergies, so that's less likely. She's been feeling hot for two days, and her temp is elevated, which suggests an infectious process.

In the first few days of sinusitis, it's often viral. Viral sinusitis can last about a week, sometimes leading to bacterial if it persists beyond 10 days. But she's had it for a week, so it's possible this is viral. However, the presence of a fever might make one think of bacterial, but it's not a very high fever.

Looking at her exam, the maxillary sinus tenderness and frontal sinus not transilluminating suggest sinus infection. The pain with tapping the upper teeth (likely related to the maxillary sinus) supports that.

Her history includes oral contraceptives, but I don't think that's directly related to sinusitis. It's more about hormonal effects, but I don't recall that being a cause here. So option E is probably not the answer.

Allergic reactions (option G) are possible, but she has no history of allergies, so that's less likely. Also, allergies might present with more itching, sneezing, etc., which aren't mentioned here.

Fungal infection (B) is rare unless she's immunocompromised, which she doesn't seem to be. So probably not B.

Chronic sinusitis (D) is usually defined as lasting more than 12 weeks, and she's only had it for a week, so D is out.

So, narrowing it down, the main options are bacterial (C), viral (F), or something else.

In acute sinusitis, the most common cause is viral, especially if it's less than 10-14 days. Bacterial sinusitis often comes after a viral infection and can present with worse symptoms or persistence beyond a week. She's had it for a week, so maybe it's transitioning, but it's not clear. The presence of fever can occur in both viral and bacterial.

But the question is about the underlying mechanism. So, if it's viral, the mechanism is viral infection. If it's bacterial, then bacterial. But without more clear signs like purulent discharge or higher fever, it's hard to tell. However, the question is about the mechanism, not the specific diagnosis.

Wait, but the question is about the underlying mechanism, not the type of sinusitis. So, the options are about the cause—like whether it's an infection, allergy, etc.

So, the options are:

A: Mucosal edema—this is a symptom or a result of inflammation, not a primary mechanism.

B: Fungal infection—unlikely here.

C: Bacterial infection—could be.

D: Chronic—no.

E: Oral contraceptives—unlikely.

F: Viral infection—could be.

G: Allergic reaction—no history.

H: Immune disorder—no signs.

I: Nasal polyps—she doesn't have them mentioned.

J: Eustachian tube dysfunction—probably related to the middle ear fluid, not the sinusitis itself.

So, the sinusitis is either viral or bacterial. Her symptoms started a week ago, and she's now presenting. The fact that she has a fever and is on day 7—could be that it's transitioning. But without more specifics, it's hard.

In the first week, it's usually viral. So if the mechanism is viral infection, that's F.

Wait, but the question is about the underlying mechanism. If it's caused by a virus, then the mechanism is viral infection. If it's bacterial, then bacterial.

So, in acute sinusitis, the initial cause is often viral, leading to inflammation and possible secondary bacterial infection. But without knowing the duration beyond a week, but in her case, it's a week.

Another point—her symptoms don't have purulent discharge. Clear rhinorrhea suggests it's viral. If it were bacterial, the discharge might be thick or purulent.

So, the most likely mechanism is viral infection, F.

So, looking at the options, the answer should be F.

The patient is a 19-year-old female with a 1-week history of nasal stuffiness, clear rhinorrhea, and a mild sore throat. She developed a low-grade fever (38.1°C) two days ago. Her physical examination reveals tenderness over the left maxillary sinus, clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, enlarged tonsils, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors. The left frontal sinus does not transilluminate, suggesting fluid or infection. She has no history of allergies, does not smoke, and her only medication is an oral contraceptive.

The question asks for the most likely underlying mechanism of her sinusitis. Acute sinusitis is often caused by viral infections, especially in the first week, and is characterized by symptoms like nasal congestion, clear rhinorrhea, and low-grade fever. Bacterial sinusitis typically arises after a viral infection, often presenting with purulent discharge or worsening symptoms beyond 10-14 days. This patient’s clear rhinorrhea and absence of purulent drainage suggest a viral etiology. While her fever could indicate an infectious process, it is not high enough to strongly suggest bacterial infection. Other options, such as allergic reactions or fungal infections, are less likely due to her lack of allergy history and absence of risk factors for fungal infection.

Given the duration of symptoms and clinical presentation, the most likely underlying mechanism is viral infection.

Answer: F
