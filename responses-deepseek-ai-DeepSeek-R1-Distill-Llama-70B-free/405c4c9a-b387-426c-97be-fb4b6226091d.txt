Okay, so I need to figure out how many airplanes are in the air worldwide right now, as of 2014. Hmm, I remember hearing some stats about air traffic before. Let me think about this.

I know that airlines operate a lot of flights every day, especially major ones like American Airlines, Delta, United, and others. But how many planes are actually in the air at any given moment? I'm not exactly sure, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I think about the number of flights per day. I remember reading that there are approximately 100,000 flights each day globally. But wait, that's the number of flights, not the number of planes in the air at the same time. So each flight is a takeoff and landing, but planes can be flying at different times.

Now, considering that each flight has a certain duration. Let's say the average flight time is maybe 2 hours. But that's a rough estimate. Some flights are much longer, like international ones, which can be 8 hours or more. Others are shorter, like domestic flights which might be an hour.

But to simplify, let's say on average, each flight takes about 2 hours. If there are 100,000 flights a day, how does that translate to the number of planes in the air at once?

Well, there are 24 hours in a day. So if each flight takes 2 hours, each plane could do about 12 flights a day (24 / 2). But that's probably not accurate because planes have to spend time on the ground for maintenance, loading, unloading, etc. So maybe each plane can only do a certain number of flights per day, like 5 or so.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about the total number of planes in service. I think there are around 100,000 aircraft registered worldwide, but that includes all types, like private planes, military, etc. Commercial airplanes are fewer. I've heard that there are about 20,000 to 30,000 commercial planes. But not all of them are flying at the same time.

So if there are, say, 20,000 commercial planes, and each spends a certain amount of time in the air each day, how many are up at once? Let's say each plane flies for 8 hours a day. That would mean each plane is on the ground for 16 hours. But that's probably not right because airlines try to maximize their fleet usage.

Alternatively, maybe the average flight time is longer. Let's say each flight is 2 hours, and each plane can do multiple flights a day. So if a plane flies 5 times a day, each time for 2 hours, that's 10 hours of flying time. But that doesn't directly help me with the number in the air at once.

Another angle: think about air traffic control data. I've heard that at peak times, like in the US, there are around 5,000 planes in the air. But that's just the US. Worldwide, it must be much higher.

Wait, the question is from 2014. I think I remember seeing a statistic that there are about 100,000 flights per day, but that's total departures. So if each flight is about 2 hours, then the number of planes in the air at any time would be roughly flights per day divided by the number of hours in a day times the average flight duration.

Wait, no, that's not the right approach. Let me think: if there are X flights per day, and each flight takes T hours, then the number of planes in the air at any given time would be approximately (X * T) / 24. Because each plane occupies the airspace for T hours, and there are 24 hours in a day.

So if X is 100,000 flights per day, and T is 2 hours, then (100,000 * 2) / 24 ≈ 8,333 planes in the air at once. But that seems low. I've heard higher numbers before.

Wait, maybe the average flight time is longer. Let's say the average is more like 3 hours. Then (100,000 * 3)/24 ≈ 12,500. Still, I think the actual number is higher than that.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of flights per day is higher. Maybe it's not 100,000 but more. I've heard that in 2014, the number of passengers was around 3 billion, but that's per year. So per day, that's about 8 million passengers, which would translate to a certain number of flights.

But I'm getting off track. Let's try another approach. I remember that the FAA tracks flights, and in the US alone, there are about 87,000 flights per day. Globally, I think it's around 100,000 or more. So if each flight is on average 2 hours, then the number of planes in the air at any time would be 100,000 flights/day * 2 hours/flight divided by 24 hours/day. That gives about 8,333 planes. But I think the actual number is higher.

Wait, perhaps the average flight duration is longer. Let's say 4 hours. Then it's (100,000 *4)/24 ≈ 16,666. Still not matching what I remember.

I think I've heard that at any given time, there are around 100,000 planes in the air. But looking at the options, option E is 100,000. But wait, that can't be right because that would imply that every flight is in the air at the same time, which isn't possible.

Wait, no, because each flight takes a certain amount of time, so the number of concurrent flights would be a fraction of the total daily flights.

Alternatively, I've come across the figure that there are approximately 100,000 flights per day, which translates to about 8,000 to 10,000 planes in the air at any given time. But looking at the options, the closest would be option I:50,000 or E:100,000.

Wait, another approach: I think the actual number is around 80,000 to 100,000. Because I've heard that there are about 100,000 planes in the air at peak times, but maybe the average is lower.

Wait, the options are A:20k, B:80k, C:200k, D:150k, E:100k, F:5k, G:320k, H:250k, I:50k, J:40k.

I think the correct answer is around 100,000. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the number is about 80,000. So option B is 80,000.

Wait, I think I remember a specific figure. I think the number is around 100,000 planes in the air at any given time, but maybe that's including all types of aircraft, not just commercial. So perhaps the correct answer is E:100,000.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I also recall that the number of commercial flights per day is about 100,000, which would mean that at any time, considering flight durations, maybe the number is around 8,000-10,000. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps I'm mixing up data.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 100,000, which is option E. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, I've heard that the number is around 300,000, but that's probably including all aircraft, like military, private, etc., which seems too high.

Wait, no, I think the correct answer is around 100,000. So I'll go with option E.

To estimate the number of airplanes in the air worldwide as of 2014, several factors were considered:

1. **Flights per Day**: It was noted that there are approximately 100,000 flights globally each day. However, this figure represents total departures, not the number of planes in the air simultaneously.

2. **Average Flight Duration**: The average flight duration was estimated to be around 2-4 hours. Using this, the number of planes in the air at any given time can be roughly calculated by dividing the total daily flights by the number of hours in a day and multiplying by the average flight duration.

3. **Example Calculation**: Using 100,000 flights/day and an average flight duration of 2 hours, the calculation yields approximately 8,333 planes in the air at once. However, this figure was considered low compared to known statistics.

4. **Peak Times and Global Estimates**: It was recalled that at peak times, the number of planes in the air worldwide is significantly higher. A commonly cited figure is around 100,000 planes in the air at any given time, particularly when considering all types of aircraft (commercial, private, military, etc.).

5. **Options Analysis**: Among the provided options, 100,000 (option E) aligns most closely with the estimated figure for the number of planes in the air worldwide at any given time as of 2014.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible answer is:

E: 100,000
