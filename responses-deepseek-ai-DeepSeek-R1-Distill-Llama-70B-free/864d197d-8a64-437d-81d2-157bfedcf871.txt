Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the principle inorganic compound found in living things. The options are A through J, with various elements and compounds listed.

Hmm, I remember that inorganic compounds are those that don't contain carbon, right? So first, I need to think about what the main inorganic substances are in living organisms.

Water comes to mind. I think water is a major component of cells. Like, cells are mostly water—something like 70-90% water. So water is definitely a big one. But wait, is water considered a compound? Yeah, because it's H2O, made of hydrogen and oxygen. So that's an inorganic compound.

Looking at the options, F is water. So that's a strong candidate.

But wait, the question says "principle," meaning the main one. Are there any other inorganic compounds that are more prominent? Well, other options are elements like oxygen (A), calcium (B), carbon (C), potassium (D), phosphorus (E), sulfur (G), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (I), and glucose (J). Oh wait, glucose is organic because it's a carbohydrate, so it's out of the question.

Now, thinking about the main elements in the body. The major elements are C, H, O, N, P, S, K, Ca, etc. But the question is about the compound, not the element. So for compounds, water is the most abundant.

Wait, another thought: do cells have more water than any other compound? I believe that's correct. So the answer should be F: water.

But wait, let me make sure. Are there any other inorganic compounds that might be more prevalent? Like maybe something else. Well, ions like Na+, K+, Ca2+ are important, but as individual ions, not as compounds. The main inorganic compounds in the body would be water, carbon dioxide, maybe some salts. But water is by far the most abundant.

So yeah, the answer should be F: water.

The question asks for the principal inorganic compound found in living things. Inorganic compounds are those that do not contain carbon. Among the options provided, water (H₂O) stands out as the most abundant inorganic compound in living organisms. Cells are composed of approximately 70-90% water, making it the most prevalent substance in terms of volume and importance for biological functions. Other options, such as oxygen, calcium, and potassium, are elements or ions but not compounds, and glucose is an organic compound. Therefore, water is the correct answer.

Answer: F
