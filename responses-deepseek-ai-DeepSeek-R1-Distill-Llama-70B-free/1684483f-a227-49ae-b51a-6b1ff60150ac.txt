Okay, so I have this Laplace transform question here. The problem is to find the Laplace transform of f(t) = t^n, where n is a positive integer. Hmm, I remember that Laplace transforms are used to convert time-domain functions into s-domain, which is useful in solving differential equations and engineering problems.

I think the Laplace transform is defined as the integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-st) f(t) dt. Right, so for this function f(t) = t^n, I'll plug that into the integral.

So the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ e^(-st) t^n dt. Wait, I think I've seen a standard form for this. Isn't there a formula for the Laplace transform of t^k? Oh yeah, I remember something involving factorials and powers of s.

Let me recall. The Laplace transform of t^k is k! / s^(k+1). So if k is n, then it should be n! divided by s raised to (n+1). Wait, but wait, does that apply here? Because n is a positive integer, so k is an integer here.

So for f(t)=t^n, the Laplace transform F(s) should be n! / s^(n+1). Let me think about why that's the case. Maybe I can derive it quickly.

Using integration by parts. Let's see, the integral of t^n e^{-st} dt from 0 to ∞. Let me set u = t^n, dv = e^{-st} dt. Then du = n t^{n-1} dt, and v = -1/s e^{-st}.

Integration by parts formula is uv - ∫ v du. So:

uv evaluated from 0 to ∞: at ∞, t is big, but e^{-st} tends to zero if s is positive, so that term would be zero. At 0, t^n is zero for n positive. So the first term is zero.

Then we have - ∫ v du = - ∫ (-1/s) e^{-st} * n t^{n-1} dt. The negatives cancel, so it's (n/s) ∫ t^{n-1} e^{-st} dt.

So this becomes (n/s) times the Laplace transform of t^{n-1}. Applying this recursively, each time reducing the exponent by 1 and multiplying by the current exponent. So after n steps, we'd get (n (n-1) ... 1 ) / s^n times the integral of e^{-st} t^0 dt, which is ∫ e^{-st} dt from 0 to ∞.

That integral is [ -1/(s) e^{-st} ] from 0 to ∞. At ∞, it's zero (assuming Re{s} >0), and at 0, it's -1/s. So we have 1/s.

Putting it all together, the integral is n! / s^{n+1}.

Looking back at the options, option B is n! / s^{n+1}, which matches what I got. So the correct answer should be B.

The Laplace transform of a function \( f(t) \) is defined as:

\[
\mathcal{L}\{f(t)\} = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t) \, dt.
\]

For \( f(t) = t^n \), where \( n \) is a positive integer, the Laplace transform becomes:

\[
\mathcal{L}\{t^n\} = \int_0^\infty e^{-st} t^n \, dt.
\]

This integral is a standard form, and its result is known to be:

\[
\mathcal{L}\{t^n\} = \frac{n!}{s^{n+1}}.
\]

This result can be derived using integration by parts, where each step reduces the exponent of \( t \) by 1 and introduces a factorial term. After \( n \) iterations, the result simplifies to \( \frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} \).

Among the given options, the correct one is:

**B: \( \frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} \).**

Answer: B
