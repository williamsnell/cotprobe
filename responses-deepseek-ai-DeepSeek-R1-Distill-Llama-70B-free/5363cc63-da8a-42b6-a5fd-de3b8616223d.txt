Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem about sales tax. Let me read it again carefully.

John Cowan and his family spent money on meals, and all the amounts were put on one check. The sales tax is 3%. They spent $6.75, $5.50, $2.35, and $1.95. I need to find out how much they paid in total, and also figure out what would happen if each meal was on a separate check.

Hmm, first, I think I need to calculate the total amount before tax when everything is on one check. Then add the tax on that total. For the separate checks scenario, I guess I have to calculate tax on each individual amount and then add all the totals together.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate the sum of all the meal amounts. So, $6.75 + $5.50 + $2.35 + $1.95.

Let me add them one by one:

6.75 + 5.50 = 12.25.

12.25 + 2.35 = 14.60.

14.60 + 1.95 = 16.55.

So the total before tax is $16.55.

Now, the sales tax is 3%, so I need to calculate 3% of $16.55 and add that to get the total amount paid.

Calculating 3% of 16.55: 0.03 * 16.55 = let me compute that. 16 * 0.03 is 0.48, 0.55 * 0.03 is 0.0165. So adding those gives 0.48 + 0.0165 = 0.4965. So the tax is $0.4965, which I can round to $0.50 because money is usually rounded to the nearest cent.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me do 16.55 * 0.03.

16.55
times 0.03
Multiply each part:

16 * 0.03 = 0.48.

0.55 * 0.03 = 0.0165.

Adding 0.48 + 0.0165 gives 0.4965, which is $0.4965. So when dealing with currency, this would round to $0.50. So the tax is 50 cents.

So the total amount paid is $16.55 + $0.50 = $17.05.

Wait, but wait a minute. Maybe I should calculate the tax exactly without rounding until the end.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute 16.55 * 1.03 to get the total including tax.

Let me compute 16.55 * 1.03.

16.55 * 1 = 16.55.

16.55 * 0.03 = 0.4965.

So 16.55 + 0.4965 = 17.0465. Which is approximately $17.05 when rounded to the nearest cent.

So the first part, when everything is on one check, the total is $17.05.

Now, the second part: if separate checks had been issued, how much would they have paid? So each meal amount is taxed separately.

That means for each amount ($6.75, $5.50, $2.35, $1.95), I calculate 3% tax on each and then add them all up.

Let me compute each one:

1. $6.75 meal plus tax.

Tax = 6.75 * 0.03 = $0.2025 → $0.20 when rounded to the nearest cent.

So total for this meal: 6.75 + 0.20 = $6.95.

2. $5.50 meal.

Tax = 5.50 * 0.03 = $0.165 → $0.17 when rounded.

Total: 5.50 + 0.17 = $5.67.

3. $2.35 meal.

Tax = 2.35 * 0.03 = $0.0705 → $0.07.

Total: 2.35 + 0.07 = $2.42.

4. $1.95 meal.

Tax = 1.95 * 0.03 = $0.0585 → $0.06.

Total: 1.95 + 0.06 = $2.01.

Now, add all these totals together.

$6.95 + $5.67 = $12.62.

$12.62 + $2.42 = $15.04.

$15.04 + $2.01 = $17.05.

Wait, that's the same as the first scenario. So both ways, the total is $17.05. But that can't be right because sometimes when you round each item, the total can change.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the rounding. Let me check each calculation again without rounding until the end.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate each tax exactly and sum them before rounding.

Let me try that approach.

Compute tax for each item without rounding:

1. $6.75 → 0.03 * 6.75 = 0.2025 → $0.2025.

2. $5.50 → 0.03 * 5.50 = 0.165 → $0.165.

3. $2.35 → 0.03 * 2.35 = 0.0705 → $0.0705.

4. $1.95 → 0.03 * 1.95 = 0.0585 → $0.0585.

Now, sum all the taxes:

0.2025 + 0.165 = 0.3675.

0.3675 + 0.0705 = 0.438.

0.438 + 0.0585 = 0.4965.

So total tax when separate checks is $0.4965, which is the same as when all items are on one check.

So the total amount would be the sum of all items plus tax: 16.55 + 0.4965 = 17.0465, which rounds to $17.05.

Wait, that's the same in both scenarios. So that can't be right, because the question is asking how much they would have paid in each case, implying that the totals are different.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because when you have separate checks, each item's tax is calculated and rounded, which could accumulate differently than the total tax on the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps when you calculate each tax and round, the total tax could be slightly different from the tax on the total sum.

Let me recalculate each tax, rounding each to the nearest cent, and then sum those rounded taxes.

So:

1. $6.75 → tax 0.2025 → $0.20.

2. $5.50 → 0.165 → $0.17.

3. $2.35 → 0.0705 → $0.07.

4. $1.95 → 0.0585 → $0.06.

Now, sum these rounded taxes: 0.20 + 0.17 = 0.37. 0.37 + 0.07 = 0.44. 0.44 + 0.06 = 0.50.

So total tax with separate checks is $0.50.

But when all items are on one check, the tax is 0.4965 → $0.50 when rounded.

So in both cases, the tax is $0.50, making the total amount $16.55 + $0.50 = $17.05 in both cases.

Wait, but that can't be. Because sometimes rounding each item can cause a difference. Let me think again.

Hmm, maybe in this particular case, the total tax comes out the same, but perhaps in the question, it's different. Let me check.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the exact tax without any rounding.

When all items are on one check:

Total = $16.55.

Tax = 16.55 * 0.03 = 0.4965 → $0.4965. So when you add that to the total, you get 16.55 + 0.4965 = 17.0465, which is $17.05 when rounded to the nearest cent.

In the separate case, each tax is calculated, then rounded, and then added.

As I calculated earlier, each tax rounded is:

$0.20, $0.17, $0.07, $0.06. Sum is $0.50.

So total with separate checks is 16.55 + 0.50 = 17.05.

Wait, that's the same as before. So both scenarios give the same total of $17.05?

But that seems odd. The question asks, "how much did they pay? If separate checks had been issued, how much would they have had to pay?" So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to compare the total tax when combined versus when separate, but in this case, both are the same. But perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when you have separate checks, the total is the same as when combined, but that's not usually the case. Normally, separate checks might round each tax, which could cause a slight difference.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe the tax when separate is a bit different.

Wait, let me recompute each tax without any rounding first.

So:

6.75 * 0.03 = 0.2025 → 20.25 cents.

5.50 * 0.03 = 0.165 → 16.5 cents.

2.35 * 0.03 = 0.0705 → 7.05 cents.

1.95 * 0.03 = 0.0585 → 5.85 cents.

Adding these exact tax amounts: 0.2025 + 0.165 = 0.3675; +0.0705 = 0.438; +0.0585 = 0.4965. So total tax is 0.4965, which is 49.65 cents. So when you round that to the nearest cent, it's $0.50.

In the separate checks scenario, each tax is calculated and then rounded.

So:

6.75 → tax $0.2025 → $0.20.

5.50 → $0.165 → $0.17.

2.35 → $0.0705 → $0.07.

1.95 → $0.0585 → $0.06.

Adding these rounded taxes: 0.20 +0.17=0.37; +0.07=0.44; +0.06=0.50.

So same as before. So both ways, the tax is $0.50.

Therefore, the total amount paid is 16.55 + 0.50 = $17.05 in both cases.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options don't have the same answer for both. Let me check the options again.

The options are A through J. The answer options are for each scenario, but the question is phrased as two questions: how much did they pay (on one check), and how much would they have paid (on separate checks). So perhaps the answer expects that both totals are the same, but looking at the options, I see that option G is $17.05, which would be the answer for both.

But wait, the options are single answers. Wait, the question is phrased as: "how much did they pay? If separate checks had been issued, how much would they have had to pay?" So the correct answer would be the same in both cases, $17.05, which is option G.

Wait, but I'm confused because sometimes when you round each item's tax, the total can be different. But in this case, it's the same. So the answer is $17.05 in both scenarios.

Looking back at the options, the options are single answers, so perhaps the question expects that the first part is $17.05, and the second part is also $17.05. But the options only list each possible answer once. So the correct answer to both parts is G: $17.05.

But wait, let me check my initial calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Calculating total spent: 6.75 +5.50 is 12.25, plus 2.35 is 14.60, plus 1.95 is 16.55. Correct.

Tax on 16.55: 16.55 * 0.03 = 0.4965 → $0.50. So total is 17.05.

Separately, each tax item:

6.75 → 0.2025 → 0.20.

5.50 →0.165 → 0.17.

2.35 →0.0705 →0.07.

1.95 →0.0585 →0.06.

Sum of taxes: 0.20+0.17=0.37 +0.07=0.44 +0.06=0.50.

Same tax, so total is same.

So the answer is $17.05 in both cases.

Looking at the options, option G is $17.05. So the answer is G for both scenarios.

Wait, but the question is phrased as two separate questions: how much did they pay (on one check), and if separate checks, how much would they have paid. So perhaps the answer expects two different values, but in this case, both are same. So the correct answer is G.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the total amount spent on meals before tax by summing the individual amounts:

\[
6.75 + 5.50 + 2.35 + 1.95 = 16.55
\]

The sales tax rate is 3%, so we calculate the tax on the total amount:

\[
16.55 \times 0.03 = 0.4965
\]

Rounding \(0.4965\) to the nearest cent gives \(0.50\). Adding this tax to the total amount before tax:

\[
16.55 + 0.50 = 17.05
\]

Thus, the total amount paid when all items are on one check is \(\$17.05\).

Next, we calculate the tax for each meal individually, sum the taxes, and then add the total amount spent on meals. The tax for each meal is calculated as follows:

1. \(6.75 \times 0.03 = 0.2025 \rightarrow 0.20\) (rounded to the nearest cent)
2. \(5.50 \times 0.03 = 0.165 \rightarrow 0.17\) (rounded to the nearest cent)
3. \(2.35 \times 0.03 = 0.0705 \rightarrow 0.07\) (rounded to the nearest cent)
4. \(1.95 \times 0.03 = 0.0585 \rightarrow 0.06\) (rounded to the nearest cent)

Summing these rounded taxes:

\[
0.20 + 0.17 + 0.07 + 0.06 = 0.50
\]

Adding this total tax to the total amount spent on meals:

\[
16.55 + 0.50 = 17.05
\]

Thus, the total amount paid when separate checks are issued is also \(\$17.05\).

In both scenarios, the total amount paid is the same: \(\$17.05\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**G: $17.05**
