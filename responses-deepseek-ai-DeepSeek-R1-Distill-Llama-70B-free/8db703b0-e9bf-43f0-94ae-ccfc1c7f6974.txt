Question:

Two friends were members of a fraternity at their college. During homecoming weekend, the fraternity held a big party, which was widely attended by students and alumni. At the party, the two friends were horsing around when the first friend pulled out a revolver. He gave the revolver's cylinder a spin, put the barrel of the gun to the second friend's head and, intending to scare the second friend, said, "Hey, man, let's play Russian roulette. " The second friend, who had consumed a fifth of bourbon, was very intoxicated. Thinking that the gun was unloaded, the second friend responded, "Sure, dude. " The first friend then pulled the trigger. The gun just made a clicking sound as the hammer fell on an empty chamber of the cylinder. The two friends both laughed and continued partying. Unbeknownst to the second friend, the first friend had placed bullets in two of the revolver's six firing chambers before making his challenge. The next day, the second friend found out that the gun was, in fact, loaded when the first friend pulled the trigger. If the second friend asserts a tort action against the first friend, he will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the first friend intended to place the second friend in apprehension.
B: prevail, because the first friend showed gross negligence.
C: not prevail, because there was no physical harm inflicted on the second friend.
D: prevail, because the first friend's actions were reckless and dangerous.
E: prevail, because there was a substantial certainty that the second friend would be placed in apprehension.
F: not prevail, because the second friend was unaware that the gun was loaded.
G: not prevail, because the first friend did not actually intend to harm the second friend.
H: not prevail, because the second friend consented to participate in the Russian roulette game.
I: not prevail, because the second friend was under the influence of alcohol.

Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, the question is about tort law, specifically regarding an incident where two friends played a form of Russian roulette at a party. I'm a bit rusty on my torts, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

First, the setup: Friend 1 pulls out a revolver, spins the cylinder, puts it to Friend 2's head, and suggests playing Russian roulette. Friend 2, who was intoxicated, thinks the gun is unloaded and agrees. Friend 1 pulls the trigger, but it just clicks because the chamber was empty. They both laugh it off. However, it turns out that Friend 1 had actually loaded two of the six chambers. The next day, Friend 2 finds out and wants to sue. The question is whether Friend 2 can succeed in a tort claim against Friend 1.

So, I need to figure out which tort this could be. The options suggest it's about intentional torts or negligence. Let's consider the elements required for each possible tort.

First, let's think about battery. Battery requires intentional harmful or offensive contact with the plaintiff's person or an extension thereof, without consent. In this case, Friend 1 pulled the trigger, but the gun didn't fire. There was no actual contact because the hammer just clicked on an empty chamber. So, maybe battery doesn't apply because there was no physical contact or harm.

Next, let's think about assault. Assault typically involves an intentional act that causes the plaintiff to reasonably apprehend imminent harmful or offensive contact. So, did Friend 1's actions cause Friend 2 to fear immediate harm? Friend 2 was intoxicated and thought the gun was unloaded, so he agreed to play along. So, at the time, Friend 2 didn't think there was any real danger. Therefore, Friend 2 didn't have apprehension of harm because he thought the gun wasn't loaded. But Friend 1 intended to scare him, and the gun was actually loaded. Hmm, but the question is about Friend 2's state of mind at the time. If Friend 2 didn't actually feel fear or apprehension because he thought it was unloaded, then assault might not apply. But wait, the first friend intended to cause apprehension. So, does that matter even if the second friend didn't actually feel it?

Wait, I think the tort of assault requires that the plaintiff actually experiences apprehension. So even if the defendant intended to cause fear, if the plaintiff didn't actually feel it, then there's no assault. So if Friend 2 didn't feel fear because he thought the gun was empty, then assault wouldn't apply. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Some sources say that the plaintiff must have a reasonable apprehension. So if the gun was actually loaded, maybe Friend 2 should have been aware, but he wasn't because he was drunk. Hmm, maybe the intoxication affects this.

Alternatively, maybe this is a case of reckless conduct. So, perhaps Friend 1 acted recklessly in handling a loaded gun, which could lead to a claim of negligence or reckless endangerment. But for negligence, the plaintiff would need to show duty, breach, causation, and damages. Here, Friend 1 owed a duty to handle firearms safely. By loading the gun and pulling the trigger, he breached that duty. The action caused the gun to click, but no physical harm. So, if there's no physical harm, can Friend 2 recover? In negligence, usually, you need actual damages, like physical injury. If Friend 2 wasn't physically harmed, maybe he can't recover under negligence unless there's an exception.

Wait, but emotional distress could be a factor. There's the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), which requires that the defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous, causing severe emotional distress. But I'm not sure if this situation rises to that level. Friend 1 was trying to scare him, but did it in a way that's considered outrageous? Maybe not, especially since they were friends horsing around. Also, IIED usually requires that the distress is severe, like leading to some psychological harm. The question doesn't mention that, so maybe that's not the case here.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Prevail because the first friend intended to place the second in apprehension. But as I thought earlier, if the second didn't actually feel apprehension, then assault wouldn't apply. So this might not work.

Option B: Prevail because of gross negligence. Gross negligence involves a significant breach of duty. Friend 1 was reckless in loading the gun and pulling the trigger. But if there's no physical harm, can Friend 2 recover? Maybe not, since damages are needed.

Option C: Not prevail because no physical harm. This is the classic case where without physical injury, you can't recover for negligence. But if it's an intentional tort, maybe physical harm isn't necessary.

Option D: Prevail because actions were reckless and dangerous. This sounds like it's about reckless conduct leading to emotional distress. But again, without physical harm, it's tricky.

Option E: Prevail because substantial certainty of apprehension. This seems to align with the idea that the defendant's actions were such that it was substantially certain to cause apprehension. But again, if the plaintiff didn't actually feel it, does that matter? Maybe this is the "intent to cause apprehension" part of assault, which is an intentional tort. But I think the plaintiff must actually experience apprehension. So E might not be correct.

Option F: Not prevail because the second friend was unaware the gun was loaded. This relates to the apprehension point. If he didn't know, he didn't fear, so no assault.

Option G: Not prevail because the first friend didn't intend to harm. But assault is about intending to cause apprehension, not necessarily intent to harm. So if Friend 1 intended to scare, that's enough for assault, regardless of intent to harm. So G might not be correct.

Option H: Not prevail because Friend 2 consented. But consent to Russian roulette? I'm not sure. If Friend 2 thought the gun was unloaded, did he really consent to the risk? Maybe the consent was to a game he thought was harmless. So perhaps the consent isn't valid because he was under a mistake of fact. So H might not be a good defense.

Option I: Not prevail because Friend 2 was intoxicated. I don't think intoxication would bar a claim. It might affect his perception, but the defendant's actions are still actionable if they meet the tort elements.

So, putting it all together, the possible options are between A, E, and F. Let me think again.

Assault requires that the plaintiff reasonably apprehends immediate harmful contact. If Friend 2 thought the gun was unloaded, then he didn't have that apprehension. So the assault wouldn't apply because the apprehension wasn't there. Therefore, Friend 2 wouldn't have a case for assault.

But what about the fact that the gun was actually loaded? Does that change anything? I think the key is the plaintiff's subjective state. If Friend 2 didn't feel fear because he thought it was unloaded, then assault doesn't apply.

So, the question is whether the second friend can sue for any tort. If assault doesn't apply because no apprehension, and battery doesn't apply because no contact, and negligence doesn't apply because no physical harm, then perhaps Friend 2 cannot prevail.

Looking at the options, option C says that he won't prevail because there's no physical harm. But if the tort is intentional infliction, maybe physical harm isn't needed. But IIED requires severe emotional distress, which isn't mentioned here.

Alternatively, maybe Friend 1's action was so reckless that it constitutes negligence per se, but without physical injury, I don't think Friend 2 can recover.

So, the likely answer is that Friend 2 cannot prevail because there was no physical harm, so option C.

But wait, another angle: the tort of assault doesn't require physical injury, just apprehension. So if Friend 2 didn't experience apprehension because he thought the gun was unloaded, then assault isn't applicable. So the only possible claim would be negligence, which requires actual damages, which he doesn't have. So he can't recover, making option C correct.

Alternatively, option F says he can't recover because he was unaware the gun was loaded. That's about the apprehension element. So F could also be correct, but I think the more accurate reason is the lack of damages, which is option C.

Wait, but some jurisdictions allow for emotional distress damages without physical harm in certain cases, but I think that's more under IIED, which requires extreme and outrageous conduct. Here, the conduct might not rise to that level.

So, the best answer is either C or F.

Option C: No physical harm, so can't recover in negligence.

Option F: No apprehension, so can't recover in assault.

But the question is asking which option is correct. The options are about whether he will prevail.

Looking back, the question says that the gun was loaded, but Friend 2 didn't know that when he played along. So when Friend 1 pulled the trigger, Friend 2 thought it was unloaded. Therefore, he didn't have apprehension. So assault isn't applicable. Without any physical injury, negligence also doesn't apply. So Friend 2 can't recover, making options C or F correct.

Option C is about no physical harm, which is a requirement for negligence. But the question is about whether he can assert a tort action. So the possible causes are assault or negligence.

Since assault requires apprehension, which Friend 2 lacked, and negligence requires damages, which he doesn't have, Friend 2 can't prevail. So the reason is either because he didn't have apprehension (F) or because he had no physical harm (C).

Looking at the answer choices, option C says he won't prevail because no physical harm, which would bar a negligence claim. Option F says he won't prevail because he was unaware, which would bar an assault claim.

So the question is, which is the correct reason? The question doesn't specify the type of tort, so perhaps the correct answer is F because without apprehension, there's no assault, and without damages, there's no negligence. But which option is more directly applicable?

Wait, the question says that Friend 2 asserts a tort action. The possible torts are assault and battery (intentional torts) or negligence. But since there's no physical contact or injury, battery and negligence are out. Assault requires apprehension, which Friend 2 didn't have, so he can't claim assault. Therefore, he can't recover, so the reason is that he didn't have apprehension.

But looking at the options, the closest is F: not prevail because he was unaware the gun was loaded. So F would be the correct reason.

But wait, in some jurisdictions, if the defendant intended to cause apprehension and the plaintiff would have reasonably apprehended but didn't because of some reason (like intoxication), does that matter? For example, if the plaintiff, due to voluntary intoxication, didn't appreciate the danger, does that negate the apprehension? I'm not sure, but I think the plaintiff's subjective state is what matters. So if Friend 2 didn't feel fear because he was drunk, then he didn't have apprehension, so no assault.

So the correct answer would be F.

Wait, but another thought: the first friend intended to cause apprehension. So in some cases, even if the plaintiff didn't feel it, the intent might matter. But I think the majority rule is that the plaintiff must actually experience apprehension. So without that, assault doesn't apply.

So, the answer is F: the second friend was unaware the gun was loaded, so he didn't have apprehension, thus no assault.

But wait, another angle: the first friend's action created a situation where a reasonable person would have felt apprehension, regardless of the second friend's subjective state. I'm a bit confused now.

For example, if the plaintiff is unaware because they're intoxicated, but a reasonable person would have been in apprehension, does that matter? I think it's the plaintiff's actual apprehension that counts. So if the plaintiff didn't feel fear because he was drunk, then he didn't have apprehension, so no assault.

Therefore, the correct answer is F.

The question revolves around whether the second friend can prevail in a tort action against the first friend after a Russian roulette incident. The key issues are whether the second friend experienced apprehension (for assault) and whether there was physical harm (for negligence or battery). 

1. **Battery**: Requires intentional harmful or offensive contact. Here, there was no physical contact or harm, as the gun did not fire. Thus, battery does not apply.

2. **Assault**: Requires an intentional act causing the plaintiff to reasonably apprehend imminent harmful or offensive contact. The second friend, being intoxicated, thought the gun was unloaded and did not feel fear or apprehension. Since apprehension is a subjective requirement, the second friend's lack of awareness means assault does not apply.

3. **Negligence**: Requires duty, breach, causation, and damages. While the first friend breached a duty of care by handling a loaded gun recklessly, the second friend suffered no physical harm. Without damages, a negligence claim cannot succeed.

4. **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)**: Requires extreme and outrageous conduct causing severe emotional distress. The facts do not indicate that the first friend's actions were extreme or that the second friend suffered severe emotional distress. Thus, IIED does not apply.

5. **Consent**: The second friend agreed to play Russian roulette, but his consent was based on the mistaken belief that the gun was unloaded. This makes his consent invalid, as it was not informed.

6. **Intoxication**: The second friend's intoxication does not bar a claim but explains why he lacked apprehension. It does not negate the first friend's potential liability.

Given these considerations, the second friend cannot prevail because he did not experience apprehension (a requirement for assault) and suffered no physical harm (a requirement for negligence). Among the options, the most accurate reason is that the second friend was unaware the gun was loaded, which directly ties to the lack of apprehension necessary for assault.

ANSWER: F
