Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about magnetic flux through a coil. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Alright, the problem says there's a circular coil with a diameter of 20 mm. The plane of the coil is perpendicular to the direction of a uniform magnetic flux density, which is 100 mT. I need to find the total flux threading the coil. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

Wait, I remember that magnetic flux is calculated using the formula Φ = B * A * cosθ, where θ is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the coil's surface. Oh right, because flux depends on how much of the magnetic field is passing through the area perpendicularly.

So in this case, the coil is mounted perpendicular to the magnetic field direction. That means the field is passing straight through the coil. So the angle θ is 0 degrees. Cos(0) is 1, so the flux is just B multiplied by the area.

But wait, the coil's diameter is 20 mm. Oh, diameter, so radius is half of that. Let me convert that to meters because the magnetic flux density is given in Tesla, which uses meters. So 20 mm is 0.02 meters in diameter, so radius r is 0.01 meters.

The area A of a circle is πr². Plugging in the numbers, A = π*(0.01)^2. Let me calculate that. 0.01 squared is 0.0001, times π is approximately 0.00031416 m².

The magnetic flux density B is 100 mT, which is 100 milliTesla. Milli is 10^-3, so that's 0.1 Tesla.

So Φ = B * A = 0.1 T * 0.00031416 m². Let me compute that. 0.1 times 0.00031416 is 0.000031416 Weber. Oh wait, because 1 Weber is 1 T·m².

But wait, the options are in microWebers (µWb). So I need to convert 0.000031416 Wb to µWb. There are 1e6 µWb in 1 Wb, right? Because micro is 1e-6. So 0.000031416 Wb * 1e6 µWb/Wb equals 31.416 µWb.

Looking at the options, option E is 31.4 µWb. That must be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Radius is 0.01 m, area π*(0.01)^2 is about 3.1416e-4 m². Multiply by B=0.1 T, gives 3.1416e-5 Wb. Converting that to µWb: 3.1416e-5 * 1e6 = 31.416 µWb. Yep, that's right. So option E is correct.

To calculate the total magnetic flux threading the coil, we use the formula for magnetic flux:

\[
\Phi = B \cdot A \cdot \cos\theta
\]

Here:
- \( B = 100 \, \text{mT} = 0.1 \, \text{T} \) (magnetic flux density),
- \( \theta = 0^\circ \) (since the coil is perpendicular to the magnetic field, \(\cos 0^\circ = 1\)),
- The diameter of the coil is \( 20 \, \text{mm} = 0.02 \, \text{m} \), so the radius is \( r = 0.01 \, \text{m} \),
- The area of the circular coil is \( A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.01)^2 = 0.00031416 \, \text{m}^2 \).

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\Phi = 0.1 \cdot 0.00031416 \cdot 1 = 0.000031416 \, \text{Wb}
\]

To convert to microWebers (\( \mu \text{Wb} \)):

\[
\Phi = 0.000031416 \, \text{Wb} \cdot 10^6 \, \mu \text{Wb/Wb} = 31.416 \, \mu \text{Wb}
\]

From the given options, the closest value is \( 31.4 \, \mu \text{Wb} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
