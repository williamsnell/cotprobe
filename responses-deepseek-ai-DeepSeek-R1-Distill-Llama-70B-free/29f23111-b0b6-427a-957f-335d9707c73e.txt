Okay, so I've got this question about whether a certain process M(t) is a martingale. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that W(t) is a Brownian motion. I remember that Brownian motion has some key properties: it starts at zero, has independent increments, and is normally distributed. Also, the covariance between W(s) and W(t) is the minimum of s and t. That might come in handy later.

Now, the process M(t) is defined as exp(i*W(t)) divided by the expectation of exp(i*W(t)). So M(t) = exp(i W(t)) / E[exp(i W(t))]. I think I need to check if this process satisfies the martingale properties: that it's adapted to the filtration, that the expected value is finite, and that the conditional expectation of the future given the past is equal to the present value.

Wait, but before that, maybe I should compute E[exp(i W(t))]. I remember that for a normal variable, the expectation of exp(i k X) is the characteristic function. Since W(t) is a Brownian motion at time t, it's normally distributed with mean 0 and variance t. So the characteristic function E[exp(i k W(t))] should be exp(-kÂ² t / 2). 

In this case, k is 1, so E[exp(i W(t))] = exp(-t/2). Oh wait, because (1)^2 is 1, so yes, that's right. So the denominator in M(t) is exp(-t/2). Therefore, M(t) simplifies as exp(i W(t)) / exp(-t/2) = exp(i W(t) + t/2). Because 1/exp(-t/2) is exp(t/2). So M(t) = exp(t/2 + i W(t)).

Wait, perhaps I should write it as exp( W(t) i + t/2 ), but maybe that's not necessary yet.

Now, to check if M(t) is a martingale. Let me recall that a process is a martingale if for any s < t, E[ M(t) | F_s ] = M(s), where F_s is the sigma algebra up to time s.

Alternatively, if I can show that the process has independent increments or some other properties, but I think checking the conditional expectation is the way to go here.

So let's compute E[ M(t) | F_s ] for s < t.

First, M(t) = exp( i W(t) ) / E[ exp(i W(t)) ].

Wait, no. Wait, earlier I thought E[exp(i W(t))] is exp(-t/2), so M(t) is exp(i W(t)) * exp(t/2). Because dividing by exp(-t/2) is the same as multiplying by exp(t/2).

So M(t) = exp(t/2) * exp(i W(t)).

Wait, wait, that's correct. Because exp(i W(t)) divided by exp(-t/2) is exp(i W(t)) * exp(t/2) = exp(t/2 + i W(t)).

So M(t) = exp( t/2 + i W(t) ).

Now, I need to compute E[ M(t) | F_s ].

Because W(t) is a Brownian motion, and F_s is the sigma algebra up to time s, I can write W(t) as W(s) + (W(t) - W(s)).

And since Brownian motion has independent increments, W(t) - W(s) is independent of F_s, and is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance t - s.

So, M(t) = exp( t/2 + i W(t) ) = exp( t/2 + i [ W(s) + (W(t)-W(s)) ] ).

Let me split that into exponentials: exp(t/2) * exp(i W(s)) * exp( i (W(t)-W(s)) ).

Wait, no: because t/2 is a scalar, and the rest is i times W(t). So M(t) = exp(t/2) * exp(i W(s)) * exp( i (W(t)-W(s)) ).

So when I take E[ M(t) | F_s ], I can bring the known terms (those adapted to F_s) out of the expectation. So,

E[ M(t) | F_s ] = exp(t/2) * exp(i W(s)) * E[ exp( i (W(t) - W(s)) ) | F_s ].

But since W(t) - W(s) is independent of F_s, the expectation becomes E[ exp( i (W(t)-W(s)) ) ].

Wait, E[ exp( i Y ) ] where Y is a normal variable with mean 0 and variance (t-s). So Y ~ N(0, t-s). The characteristic function is exp( - (k^2) Var(Y) / 2 ), where k is 1 here.

So E[ exp( i Y ) ] = exp( - (1)^2 (t-s) / 2 ) = exp( - (t-s)/2 ).

So putting it all together:

E[ M(t) | F_s ] = exp(t/2) * exp(i W(s)) * exp( - (t - s)/2 )

Simplify the exponents:

t/2 - (t - s)/2 = [ t - (t - s) ] / 2 = s/2.

So E[ M(t) | F_s ] = exp(s/2) * exp(i W(s)).

But wait, that is exactly M(s), because M(s) = exp(s/2) * exp(i W(s)).

So E[ M(t) | F_s ] = M(s). That satisfies the martingale condition.

Wait, is that correct? Because M(t) is expressed as exp(t/2 + i W(t)), and the expectation simplifies to M(s). So yes, the conditional expectation equals the current value, which is the definition of a martingale.

Therefore, M(t) is a martingale. So the answer should be 1 for yes.

Looking back at the options, option B is 1.0. So the correct answer is B.

To determine whether \( M(t) \) is a martingale, we start with its definition:

\[
M(t) = \frac{\exp(i W(t))}{E[\exp(i W(t))]}.
\]

Here, \( W(t) \) is a Brownian motion, which is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance \( t \). The expectation \( E[\exp(i W(t))] \) is the characteristic function of a normal variable, given by:

\[
E[\exp(i W(t))] = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{2}\right).
\]

Thus, \( M(t) \) simplifies to:

\[
M(t) = \exp\left(i W(t)\right) \cdot \exp\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) = \exp\left(\frac{t}{2} + i W(t)\right).
\]

To check if \( M(t) \) is a martingale, we verify the martingale condition: for any \( s < t \), \( E[M(t) | \mathcal{F}_s] = M(s) \), where \( \mathcal{F}_s \) is the filtration up to time \( s \).

Using the properties of Brownian motion, \( W(t) \) can be decomposed as:

\[
W(t) = W(s) + \left(W(t) - W(s)\right),
\]

where \( W(t) - W(s) \) is independent of \( \mathcal{F}_s \) and normally distributed with mean 0 and variance \( t - s \). Substituting this into \( M(t) \), we have:

\[
M(t) = \exp\left(\frac{t}{2} + i W(s) + i \left(W(t) - W(s)\right)\right).
\]

Taking the conditional expectation \( E[M(t) | \mathcal{F}_s] \), the terms adapted to \( \mathcal{F}_s \) (i.e., \( \exp\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) \) and \( \exp(i W(s)) \)) can be factored out:

\[
E[M(t) | \mathcal{F}_s] = \exp\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) \cdot \exp(i W(s)) \cdot E\left[\exp\left(i \left(W(t) - W(s)\right)\right) | \mathcal{F}_s\right].
\]

Since \( W(t) - W(s) \) is independent of \( \mathcal{F}_s \), the expectation becomes:

\[
E\left[\exp\left(i \left(W(t) - W(s)\right)\right)\right] = \exp\left(-\frac{(t - s)}{2}\right),
\]

where we used the characteristic function of a normal variable. Substituting this back, we get:

\[
E[M(t) | \mathcal{F}_s] = \exp\left(\frac{t}{2}\right) \cdot \exp(i W(s)) \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{(t - s)}{2}\right).
\]

Simplifying the exponents:

\[
\frac{t}{2} - \frac{(t - s)}{2} = \frac{s}{2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
E[M(t) | \mathcal{F}_s] = \exp\left(\frac{s}{2}\right) \cdot \exp(i W(s)) = M(s).
\]

This confirms that \( M(t) \) satisfies the martingale condition. Therefore, \( M(t) \) is a martingale.

The correct answer is **B: 1.0**.
