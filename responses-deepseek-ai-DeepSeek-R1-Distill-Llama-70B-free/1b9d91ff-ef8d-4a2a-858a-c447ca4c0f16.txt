Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the percent markup on a radio. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says the radio was originally priced at $2.25. This week, it was marked up and sold at $2.50. I need to find the percentage of the markup.

Hmm, markup percentage. I remember that markup is the amount added to the original price to get the selling price. So the formula should involve the increase over the original price, right?

Wait, no, wait. Or is it over the selling price? No, I think it's over the original. Because markup is usually based on the cost. Let me think. Yeah, markup percentage is calculated by (markup amount/original price) * 100. So that gives the percentage increase relative to the original cost.

So first, I need to find the markup amount. The selling price is $2.50, and the original was $2.25. So the markup is 2.50 minus 2.25. Let me calculate that: 2.50 - 2.25 equals 0.25. So the markup amount is $0.25.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Because sometimes people get confused between markup and margin. Markup is the amount added to the cost to get the selling price, while margin is the selling price minus cost over selling price. But the question here is about markup, so I think my initial approach is correct.

So the markup is $0.25 over the original $2.25. To find the percentage, I divide the markup by the original price and multiply by 100.

Let me write that down. Markup percentage = (markup amount / original price) * 100.

Plugging the numbers in: (0.25 / 2.25) * 100.

Wait, 0.25 divided by 2.25. Let me calculate that. 0.25 is a quarter, and 2.25 is a little more than twice that, since 2.25 is 9/4, or 2 and 1/4. So 0.25 divided by 2.25 equals... let's see. 0.25 is 1/4, and 2.25 is 9/4. So (1/4) divided by (9/4) is (1/4) * (4/9) )= 1/9.

1/9 as a decimal is approximately 0.1111. So 0.1111 multiplied by 100 gives 11.11%.

Looking at the options, option D is 11%, which is the closest. But wait, I should check if any options match exactly. Let me see. The options are A:20%, B:12%, C:8%, D:11%, E:10%, F:15%, G:30%, H:25%, I:5%, J:18%. So D is 11%, which is exactly 11.11% when rounded to the nearest whole number.

Wait, but wait another thought. Did I use the correct formula? Oh wait, sometimes people calculate markup based on the selling price, but I don't think that's the case here. Because markup percentage is traditionally based on cost, not selling price. So yes, my calculation should be correct.

So the markup is 11.11%, so the closest option is D:11%.

I think that's the right answer. So I should choose option D.

To determine the percent markup, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Markup Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Markup Amount}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100
\]

1. **Calculate the Markup Amount**:  
   The selling price is $2.50, and the original price is $2.25.  
   \[
   \text{Markup Amount} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Original Price} = 2.50 - 2.25 = 0.25
   \]

2. **Apply the Formula**:  
   \[
   \text{Markup Percentage} = \left( \frac{0.25}{2.25} \right) \times 100
   \]

3. **Simplify the Calculation**:  
   \[
   \frac{0.25}{2.25} = \frac{1}{9} \approx 0.1111
   \]
   \[
   0.1111 \times 100 \approx 11.11\%
   \]

4. **Select the Closest Option**:  
   Among the given choices, 11.11% is closest to option **D: 11%**.

Thus, the percent markup is **11%**.
