Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man was arrested and charged with sexually assaulting a child. At trial, in its case-in-chief, the prosecution seeks to introduce evidence that the man had twice been previously involved in similar cases with other children. The prosecution argues that these past crimes demonstrate the likelihood that the man molested this child. Defense counsel objects to the evidence regarding other children. The judge should find the evidence

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the prosecution cannot initiate evidence of bad character.
B: admissible, because the evidence of past crimes is relevant to the case at hand.
C: inadmissible, because the evidence of past crimes is prejudicial and would bias the jury.
D: admissible, because the man's past crimes demonstrate a pattern of behavior.
E: inadmissible, because past crimes may not be introduced to prove disposition to commit certain acts.
F: inadmissible, because the man's past crimes are not similar enough to the current charge.
G: admissible, because a common plan or scheme may be proven by other similar criminal acts.
H: admissible, as long as the evidence of past crimes does not outweigh its probative value.
I: inadmissible, because past crimes are not relevant to the case at hand.
J: admissible, because the man's past crimes may be introduced to show that he is more likely to have committed the crime with which he is charged.

Okay, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically regarding the admissibility of prior crimes in a sexual assault case. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is that a man is on trial for sexually assaulting a child. The prosecution wants to introduce evidence that he was involved in two similar cases before. They argue that this shows he's likely to have committed the current crime. The defense objects, and the judge has to decide.

I remember that evidence of prior crimes is generally not admissible to prove that the person has a bad character or is disposed to commit such crimes. That's under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 404(a), which says that evidence of a person's character or character trait to prove they acted in a certain way on a particular occasion is inadmissible.

But wait, there are exceptions. Rule 404(b) allows the introduction of prior crimes for certain purposes, like showing motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident. So if the prosecution can tie the prior acts to one of these purposes, it might be admissible.

In this question, the prosecution is arguing that the past crimes show likelihood, which sounds like they're trying to prove propensity. That's exactly what's prohibited by Rule 404(a). Unless they can find another purpose under 404(b), it's inadmissible.

Looking at the answer options:

Option A says it's inadmissible because the prosecution can't introduce bad character evidence. That aligns with Rule 404(a), so this is a strong candidate.

Option B says it's admissible because it's relevant. But relevance alone isn't enough; the evidence might be relevant but still inadmissible under 404.

Option C says it's inadmissible because it's prejudicial. While prior crimes can be prejudicial, the issue here is more about propensity, so this might not be the best reason.

Option D argues it's admissible to show a pattern. That sounds like it's using it for propensity again, which would be barred unless under 404(b) for a plan or scheme.

Option E says it's inadmissible because past crimes can't show disposition. That's correct because Rule 404(a) prohibits using prior crimes to show a person is disposed to commit such acts.

Option F is about similarity. If the prior crimes aren't similar enough, they might not be admissible. But the question doesn't say they're dissimilar, so this might not apply.

Option G mentions a common plan or scheme, which is an exception under 404(b). If the prosecution can show that the prior acts are part of a plan, then it's admissible. But the question doesn't state that they're arguing for a plan; they're just using it to show likelihood.

Option H talks about probative value outweighing prejudice. That's under Rule 403, which allows exclusion if the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value. But the question is about the initial admissibility, not whether it's more prejudicial than probative.

Option I says it's inadmissible because it's irrelevant. But prior crimes can be relevant, so this is incorrect.

Option J says it's admissible to show likelihood. That's exactly what's prohibited, so this is wrong.

So the key here is that the prosecution is using the prior crimes to show the man is likely to commit the crime again, which is using it for propensity. That's prohibited under 404(a), so the evidence should be inadmissible.

Looking back at the options, E says it's inadmissible because past crimes can't be used to prove disposition. That matches with the reasoning. A also seems correct, but E is more specific about disposition.

Wait, option A says prosecution can't initiate evidence of bad character. But the defense can bring up good character, not the prosecution. So A's reasoning is correct as well. Hmm.

Wait, Rule 404(a) says that evidence of a person's character or a character trait is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as those stated in 404(b).

So the prosecution's use is to show he's likely to have committed the crime, which is using it for character evidence, which is prohibited unless an exception applies.

So the correct answer should be E, because past crimes can't be used to prove disposition. Alternatively, A is about bad character evidence, which the prosecution can't bring up. So I'm a bit torn between A and E.

Wait, the question says the prosecution is seeking to introduce this evidence in their case-in-chief. So they're the ones bringing it up. A says the prosecution cannot initiate evidence of bad character. That's correct because the prosecution generally can't introduce evidence of a defendant's bad character unless it's for a specific purpose under 404(b). So in this case, since the purpose is to show propensity, it's inadmissible under 404(a), which is what E states. So E is the more accurate reason here.

The admissibility of evidence regarding the man's prior involvement in similar cases hinges on the application of Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 404. Rule 404(a) prohibits the use of prior crimes to prove a person's character or disposition to commit a crime on a particular occasion. However, Rule 404(b) allows such evidence for specific purposes, such as proving motive, intent, or a common plan or scheme. 

In this case, the prosecution seeks to introduce the prior crimes to demonstrate the likelihood that the man committed the current crime, which amounts to using the evidence to show propensity. This is explicitly barred under Rule 404(a) unless it falls under one of the exceptions in Rule 404(b). The question does not indicate that the prosecution is arguing for an exception under Rule 404(b), such as a common plan or scheme. Therefore, the evidence is inadmissible because it is being used to prove disposition, which is prohibited.

Option E correctly identifies this issue, stating that past crimes cannot be introduced to prove disposition to commit certain acts. While Option A is also correct in stating that the prosecution cannot initiate evidence of bad character, Option E is more specific and directly addresses the prohibition on using prior crimes to prove disposition.

Answer: E
