Okay, so I have this question about the "Lion Man" from Hohlenstein-Stadel cave, and I need to figure out what category it falls into. The options are A through D, and I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll have to think through each option.

First, let me recall what I know about prehistoric art. I remember that there are two main types: portable art and parietal art. Portable art are objects that can be moved, like small figurines, while parietal art refers to cave paintings or carvings on walls, which are stationary.

The Lion Man, I think, is a small statue. It's also called the Lion-Human because it's a figure with a lion's head and human body. I've heard it's one of the oldest known examples of prehistoric sculpture. So it's a figurine, which makes me think it's portable art.

Looking at the options:

A: Mobiliary art. Wait, isn't mobiliary art another term for portable art? So if the Lion Man is a small statue, it would be mobiliary. That makes sense because mobiliary refers to objects that are mobile, not fixed on a wall.

B: Long-distance trade of exotic raw materials. Hmm, I'm not sure. The Lion Man is made of mammoth ivory, I believe. But whether that implies trade? Maybe, but the question is about what category it's an example of, not the material's origin. So maybe B isn't the answer.

C: Parietal art. That's the cave paintings, like in Lascaux or Altamira. But the Lion Man is a statue, so it's not parietal. So C is probably not correct.

D: A Venus figurine. Venus figurines are those small statues of women, like the Venus of Willendorf. They're typically depicting females with exaggerated features. The Lion Man is a male figure with a lion's head, so it's not a Venus figurine. So D is out.

So putting it together, the Lion Man is a portable art piece, which is mobiliary art. So the answer should be A.

The Lion Man from Hohlenstein-Stadel cave is a small statue carved from mammoth ivory, depicting a figure with a lion's head and human body. This makes it an example of portable art, also known as mobiliary art. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Mobiliary art** is correct because the Lion Man is a portable figurine.  
- **B: Long-distance trade of exotic raw materials** is not directly relevant to the question, which focuses on the category of the artifact.  
- **C: Parietal art** refers to cave paintings or wall carvings, which the Lion Man is not.  
- **D: A Venus figurine** is incorrect because Venus figurines are female figures, unlike the Lion Man.  

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A
