Okay, I need to tackle this multiple-choice question about American realists and formalism. Hmm, I remember that there's a lot about legal philosophy here. So the question is asking why American realists thought formalism devalued the authority of judges to make law. 

First, I should probably recall what formalism is. Formalism in law, I think, is the belief that the law can be applied through a strict, logical, almost mechanical process. Like, judges just apply the law as it is, without considering external factors or their own judgments. It's all about the structure of legal reasoning, maybe like syllogisms—major premise, minor premise, conclusion. So in formalism, the judge's role is limited to applying existing law, not making new law.

Now, American Legal Realism was a movement that criticized formalism. Realists argued that judges don't just mechanically apply the law; they make decisions based on their own experiences, biases, and societal influences. So realists believed that the law isn't as rigid as formalists made it out to be. They thought that formalism ignored the reality that judges have discretion and that the law evolves with society.

The question is specifically about the devaluation of the judge's authority to make law. So, formalism says judges just apply the law, not make it. Therefore, if formalism is the dominant view, it undermines the idea that judges actually create or change the law through their decisions. Realists would argue that by saying judges are just applying pre-existing rules, formalism takes away recognition of the judge's role in shaping the law.

Looking at the options:

A: Judicial decisions are less important than legislation. I'm not sure about this. Formalism might prioritize clear laws, but does it say courts are less important? Maybe not directly.

B: The structure of legal reasoning is flawed. Realists might think formalism’s structure is too rigid, but the question is about devaluing the judge's law-making authority. So not sure if this is the main point.

C: Judges are not allowed to interpret the law, only apply it. That sounds more like what formalism suggests. If judges only apply, they don't make law, which would devalue their authority as lawmakers.

D: Formalism doesn't allow for moral considerations. Realists might think that moral factors should influence decisions, but I'm not sure if that's the main point here about authority.

E: Formalism treats legal reasoning as syllogistic. Oh, right, that's a key point of formalism. But does that devalue the judge's authority? Maybe, because if it's just syllogistic, then the judge's role is mechanical, not creative.

F: Formalism undervalues societal changes. Yes, realists would say that law should adapt, but again, the focus is on the judge's authority to make law.

G: Judges base decisions on formal logic. Again, this is more about the method, but does it devalue their authority? Maybe, because it suggests they're not really making decisions, just following logic.

H: Laws are written with perfect clarity. If laws are perfectly clear, then judges just apply them, no interpretation needed. So their role is diminished as lawmakers.

I: Formalism makes law rigid. That aligns with realist criticism, but the question is about the judge's authority to make law.

J: Judges lack training in formal logic. That seems unrelated to their authority.

Wait, the question is why realists argued that formalism devalued the judge's authority. So formalism would say the judge doesn't make law, just applies it. So the authority to make law is taken away because they're seen as mere appliers. So which option reflects that?

Option C says judges are only allowed to apply, not interpret. If they can't interpret, they can't make new law. So that would devalue their authority as lawmakers.

Option E says formalism treats reasoning as syllogistic. Which would mean the judge's role is mechanical, just applying premises. So this also suggests they don't have authority to make law beyond applying existing rules.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between C and E. Let me think again. The realists' argument is that formalism makes it seem like judges don't make law, thus their authority is less. So if formalism says judges only apply, not make, that's option C.

Wait, but another angle: formalism's syllogistic approach (option E) might make it seem like the outcome is determined, so judges don't have discretion, thus their authority to make law is devalued. So perhaps E is the answer.

Wait, the question says "because" so the reasoning is about why the authority is devalued. If formalism treats legal reasoning as syllogistic, then the judge's role is limited, so they aren't seen as making law, just following logic. So E could be the answer.

Alternatively, C says judges can't interpret, only apply. That directly limits their law-making authority.

I think both C and E are related, but the more precise answer would be about the role of interpretation. If judges can't interpret, they can't make law. So C is about the function of the judge, whereas E is about the method.

But wait, realists might argue that formalism's approach (like syllogism) leads people to think judges aren't making law, thus undermining their authority. So the reasoning is that the structure (syllogistic) is what devalues the judge's role in making law.

I'm getting a bit confused, but I think the correct answer is E. Because formalism's approach of treating reasoning as syllogistic makes it seem mechanical, implying that judges don't have the authority to make new law, just apply existing rules.

Wait, but when I think about it, formalism would argue that judges apply the law through logical steps, which are syllogistic. So if the process is seen as mechanical, then the judge's role in making law is diminished. So E would be the reason why their authority is devalued.

Alternatively, option C says judges can't interpret. But formalism doesn't necessarily say they can't interpret; it's more that they interpret in a constrained way. So maybe option C isn't accurate.

Wait, maybe the realists' point is that formalism's emphasis on syllogistic reasoning makes it seem like the law is determinate, so judges don't have discretion. Thus, their authority to make law is less because their decisions are seen as predetermined by the syllogism, not as an act of will or interpretation.

So I think the answer is E.

American realists argued that formalism devalued the authority of judges to make law because formalism treats legal reasoning as syllogistic reasoning. This approach implies that judges merely apply pre-existing rules through a mechanical, logical process, rather than exercising discretion or interpreting the law in a way that shapes or creates new law. By framing legal reasoning as a deterministic, syllogistic exercise, formalism diminishes the recognition of judges' roles as active participants in the evolution of the law. This perspective undermines the authority of judges to make law, as their decisions are seen as predetermined by logical structures rather than as creative or interpretive acts.
