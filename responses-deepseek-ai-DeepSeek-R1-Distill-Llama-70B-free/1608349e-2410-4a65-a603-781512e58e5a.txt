Okay, so I've got this complex analysis problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about evaluating an integral involving a bounded entire function. Let me recall what I know about entire functions and complex integrals.

Alright, the function f is entire, which means it's analytic everywhere in the complex plane. Also, it's bounded, so by Liouville's theorem, I think that would make f a constant function. Wait, no, wait. Liouville's theorem states that if an entire function is bounded, then it's constant. So yes, f must be constant. That's an important point.

The integral given is the integral of f(z) divided by (z - z₁)(z - z₂) around the circle |z| = r. So the integral is ∫_{|z|=r} [f(z) / ( (z - z₁)(z - z₂) ) ] dz.

Since z₁ and z₂ are points inside the ball B(0,r), that means both z₁ and z₂ are inside the contour |z|=r. So both points are inside the circle around which we're integrating.

Wait, but the function in the integrand has poles at z₁ and z₂. Since f is entire, it doesn't contribute any singularities. So the integrand has two simple poles inside the contour.

Now, I remember that for such integrals, Cauchy's integral formula or the residue theorem would be applicable. Let me think about how to apply it here.

Cauchy's integral formula says that for a function g(z) analytic inside and on a contour C, the integral of g(z)/(z - a) around C is 2πi times g(a), provided a is inside C. But here, our denominator is (z - z₁)(z - z₂), so it's a product of two terms. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can split this into partial fractions. Let me try that. Let's consider 1/( (z - z₁)(z - z₂) ) = A/(z - z₁) + B/(z - z₂). Solving for A and B.

So, 1 = A(z - z₂) + B(z - z₁). Let me plug in z = z₁: 1 = A(z₁ - z₂) → A = 1/(z₁ - z₂). Similarly, plugging z = z₂: 1 = B(z₂ - z₁) → B = 1/(z₂ - z₁) = -1/(z₁ - z₂).

So, 1/( (z - z₁)(z - z₂) ) = [1/(z₁ - z₂)] [1/(z - z₁) - 1/(z - z₂)].

So now, the integral becomes f(z) times this expression, integrated over |z|=r.

Substituting, the integral becomes [1/(z₁ - z₂)] times the integral of f(z)[1/(z - z₁) - 1/(z - z₂)] dz.

So that's the same as [1/(z₁ - z₂)] [ ∫ f(z)/(z - z₁) dz - ∫ f(z)/(z - z₂) dz ].

Now each of these integrals can be evaluated using Cauchy's integral formula. Since f is entire, each integral would just be 2πi f(z₁) and 2πi f(z₂) respectively.

So putting it all together:

[1/(z₁ - z₂)] [2πi f(z₁) - 2πi f(z₂)].

Factor out the 2πi:

2πi [f(z₁) - f(z₂)] / (z₁ - z₂).

Wait a second, but I remember that f is a constant function because it's entire and bounded. Oh, right! Because Liouville's theorem says that bounded entire functions must be constant. So f(z₁) and f(z₂) are the same; they're equal to the same constant value. Let's call this constant c.

So f(z₁) = c and f(z₂) = c.

Substituting back into the expression, we get:

2πi (c - c) / (z₁ - z₂) = 0.

So the integral equals zero.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's retrace the steps.

1. f is entire and bounded → f is constant by Liouville.

2. The integral has poles at z₁ and z₂, both inside |z|=r.

3. Used partial fractions to split the denominator.

4. Applied Cauchy's formula to each term, yielding f(z₁) and f(z₂).

5. Substituted f(z₁) = f(z₂) → their difference is zero.

So the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer should be C: 0.0.

Alternatively, I can think about using the Residue Theorem. The integrand has two simple poles inside the contour. The residue at z₁ is f(z₁)/(z₁ - z₂), and at z₂ is -f(z₂)/(z₁ - z₂). The sum of residues is [f(z₁) - f(z₂)]/(z₁ - z₂). Multiply by 2πi gives the same result as before, which is zero because f(z₁) = f(z₂). So the integral is zero.

The problem involves evaluating the integral 

\[
\int_{|z|=r} \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_1)(z-z_2)} \, dz,
\]

where \( f \) is a bounded entire function, and \( z_1, z_2 \) are two points inside the ball \( B(0, r) \). Here is the analysis:

1. **Nature of \( f(z) \):** Since \( f \) is entire and bounded, Liouville's theorem implies that \( f(z) \) must be constant. Let this constant be \( c \). Thus, \( f(z_1) = f(z_2) = c \).

2. **Poles of the integrand:** The integrand \( \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_1)(z-z_2)} \) has simple poles at \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \), both of which lie inside the contour \( |z| = r \).

3. **Partial fraction decomposition:** The denominator can be decomposed as:
   \[
   \frac{1}{(z-z_1)(z-z_2)} = \frac{1}{z_1 - z_2} \left( \frac{1}{z-z_1} - \frac{1}{z-z_2} \right).
   \]
   Substituting this into the integral, we get:
   \[
   \int_{|z|=r} \frac{f(z)}{(z-z_1)(z-z_2)} \, dz = \frac{1}{z_1 - z_2} \left( \int_{|z|=r} \frac{f(z)}{z-z_1} \, dz - \int_{|z|=r} \frac{f(z)}{z-z_2} \, dz \right).
   \]

4. **Applying Cauchy's integral formula:** For each term, Cauchy's integral formula gives:
   \[
   \int_{|z|=r} \frac{f(z)}{z-z_1} \, dz = 2\pi i f(z_1), \quad \int_{|z|=r} \frac{f(z)}{z-z_2} \, dz = 2\pi i f(z_2).
   \]
   Since \( f(z_1) = f(z_2) = c \), the difference \( f(z_1) - f(z_2) = 0 \).

5. **Result:** Substituting back, the integral becomes:
   \[
   \frac{1}{z_1 - z_2} \cdot 2\pi i (f(z_1) - f(z_2)) = \frac{1}{z_1 - z_2} \cdot 2\pi i \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]

Thus, the value of the integral is \( 0.0 \).
