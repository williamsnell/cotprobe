Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about psychotherapies and self-disclosure. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which therapy specifically recommends self-disclosure by the psychologist as a technique.

Let me start by recalling what each of these therapies generally involves. Self-disclosure means the therapist shares their own thoughts or feelings with the client. I think some therapies encourage this more than others.

Option A: Object Relations Therapy. From what I remember, this is about how people form relationships based on early interactions. The therapist might analyze the client's past, but I'm not sure how much they self-disclose here. It's more about the client's internal object relations.

Option B: Play Therapy. This is usually for children. The therapist uses play to communicate. I don't think self-disclosure is a big part here since the focus is on the child's play behavior.

Option C: Interpersonal Therapy. This focuses on improving communication skills and dealing with interpersonal issues. The therapist might be more active, maybe sharing some perspectives, but I'm not certain if self-disclosure is a main technique.

Option D: Narrative Therapy. This approach helps clients reframe their stories. The therapist is more of a collaborator but I don't recall it emphasizing the therapist's own disclosures much.

Option E: Transactional Analysis. This involves analyzing interactions between the ego states (Parent, Adult, Child). The therapist might use some self-disclosure to model healthy communication, but I'm not sure if it's a primary technique.

Option F: Dialectical Behavior Therapy. This is more about teaching coping skills and mindfulness. The therapist is supportive but I don't think they frequently self-disclose.

Option G: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. CBT is very structured, focusing on identifying and changing thoughts and behaviors. The therapist is more of a guide, and I don't think self-disclosure is a key method here.

Option H: Feminist Psychotherapy. This approach emphasizes empowerment and addresses gender and societal issues. I think in feminist therapy, the therapist might self-disclose more to create equality and reduce the power imbalance. That sounds familiar as a technique they use.

Option I: Gestalt Therapy. This therapy focuses on the present moment and the client's awareness. The therapist might engage in dialogue and use their own reactions to help the client, so maybe self-disclosure is used here.

Option J: Exposure Therapy. This is about gradually exposing clients to feared situations. The therapist's role is more about guiding the exposure, not so much about their own feelings.

Wait, so which ones are more about the therapist sharing their own feelings? I remember that in Gestalt therapy, the therapist might express their own emotions or reactions to what the client is saying. It's part of the authentic interaction between therapist and client. So in Gestalt, self-disclosure is a technique.

But then, what about feminist therapy? I think feminist therapists do engage in self-disclosure to build a more equal relationship. They might share their own experiences to model authenticity and support the client's empowerment.

Hmm. So now I'm a bit confused between H and I. The question is which one specifically recommends self-disclosure as a technique.

Another thought: Gestalt therapy emphasizes the here and now and the therapist being genuine. So self-disclosure is a tool to facilitate the client's awareness. I think that's correct.

Wait, but I also remember that in some humanistic therapies, like person-centered, self-disclosure isn't the main approach. But that's not one of the options here.

So, putting it together. The options that involve therapist self-disclosure are H (Feminist) and I (Gestalt). The question is which one is specifically recommended and frequently applied.

I think Gestalt Therapy (Option I) is known for the therapist's use of self-disclosure as a technique. They might share their feelings to help the client process theirs. For example, if the client says something that triggers a reaction, the therapist might express that to explore it together.

Feminist therapy does use self-disclosure too, but maybe it's more about demystifying the therapeutic process and building rapport. Both could use it, but I'm trying to remember which one emphasizes it more as a technique.

Wait, another angle: In Gestalt, the therapist might use their own experiences or feelings as part of the dialogue. So it's a specific technique, perhaps more so than in feminist therapy, where it's more about the therapeutic relationship aspects.

So, I'm leaning towards Option I: Gestalt Therapy.

The question asks which psychotherapy specifically recommends and frequently applies self-disclosure by the psychologist as a technique. Self-disclosure refers to the therapist sharing their own thoughts or feelings with the client, and this is more prominent in certain therapeutic approaches.

- **Option A: Object Relations Therapy** focuses on analyzing the client's internal relationships and early interactions, not on therapist self-disclosure.  
- **Option B: Play Therapy** involves using play to communicate with children, with little emphasis on the therapist's self-disclosure.  
- **Option C: Interpersonal Therapy** centers on improving communication skills but does not emphasize self-disclosure as a primary technique.  
- **Option D: Narrative Therapy** focuses on reframing the client's personal stories, with the therapist acting as a collaborator rather than disclosing their own feelings.  
- **Option E: Transactional Analysis** involves analyzing interactions between ego states, with some potential for self-disclosure, but it is not a primary technique.  
- **Option F: Dialectical Behavior Therapy** emphasizes teaching coping skills and mindfulness, with the therapist acting as a guide rather than using self-disclosure.  
- **Option G: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy** is structured and focuses on identifying and changing thoughts and behaviors, with little use of self-disclosure.  
- **Option H: Feminist Psychotherapy** emphasizes empowerment and addressing societal issues, with some use of self-disclosure to create equality, but it is not the primary focus.  
- **Option I: Gestalt Therapy** focuses on the present moment and the therapist-client dialogue. Self-disclosure is a key technique, as the therapist may share their own reactions or feelings to help the client process theirs.  
- **Option J: Exposure Therapy** involves gradually exposing clients to feared situations, with the therapist guiding the process rather than using self-disclosure.  

Between **Option H (Feminist Psychotherapy)** and **Option I (Gestalt Therapy)**, both use self-disclosure, but Gestalt Therapy is specifically known for emphasizing self-disclosure as a technique to facilitate client awareness and genuine interaction. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I: Gestalt Therapy**

Answer: I
