Okay, so I've got this question here: "Which of these planets has no known moon?" The options are A through I, each representing a different planet. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that in our solar system, most planets have moons. The ones that come to mind immediately are Jupiter and Saturn—they have a lot of moons. I think Jupiter has like 79 or something, and Saturn has those beautiful rings and a bunch of moons too. So options G and H are definitely out because they have moons.

Then there's Earth. Oh yeah, Earth has the Moon, which is pretty obvious. So option D is not the answer. Mars, I believe, has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. So option C, Mars, has moons. Option B says Mars' moon was recently discovered. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because I thought Mars' moons were discovered a long time ago. Hmm, maybe that's a trick. But regardless, Mars does have known moons, so both B and C would refer to Mars, but C is the correct statement. So B might be a wrong option because it's claiming the moon was recently discovered, which isn't true. So Mars has moons, so neither B nor C would be the correct answer.

Next, Uranus and Neptune. I'm pretty sure both of these have moons. Uranus has Miranda and others, and Neptune has Triton, which is a notable moon. So options E and F can be ruled out.

Now, Mercury. I remember that Mercury is a planet close to the sun, and I think it's one of the planets without a moon. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. I know Venus doesn't have a moon either. Oh wait, the question includes Mercury as option A. So if Mercury has no moons, then A would be the answer. But wait, does Mercury have any moons? I think it doesn't. I recall that Mercury and Venus are the two planets in the solar system without natural satellites. So Mercury would have no known moons.

Looking back at the options, option I is Pluto. Wait, Pluto is a dwarf planet, not a main planet anymore, but it does have moons. I think Pluto has Charon and a few others. So option I is not the answer.

So putting it all together: the planets without moons are Mercury and Venus. But in the options given, Mercury is option A. Venus isn't listed here, so the correct answer must be A: Mercury.

The question asks which planet has no known moon. Let's analyze the options:

- **A: Mercury** – Mercury is a planet close to the Sun and is known to have no natural satellites or moons.
- **B: Mars' moon was recently discovered** – This is incorrect. Mars has two known moons, Phobos and Deimos, which were discovered long ago.
- **C: Mars** – Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, so it does have known moons.
- **D: Earth** – Earth has one moon, so this is not the answer.
- **E: Uranus** – Uranus has several moons, including Miranda.
- **F: Neptune** – Neptune has moons, such as Triton.
- **G: Jupiter** – Jupiter has many moons, including the four largest ones.
- **H: Saturn** – Saturn is famous for its rings and numerous moons.
- **I: Pluto** – Pluto has moons, such as Charon.

Among the options, **Mercury (A)** is the only planet with no known moons. Venus also has no moons, but it is not listed as an option. Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Mercury**.

Answer: A
