Question:

Phosphate can be removed from sewage effluent by adding magnesium oxide and ammonium ion according to the re- action 5H_2O + H_2PO^-_4 + MgO + NH^+_4 \rightarrow Mg(NH_4)PO_4 \bullet 6H_2O. The magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate (Mg(NH_4)PO_4 \bullet6H_2O) precipitates out. In theory, how much of this could be produced if a city processes 5 million gal. (41.7 million lb.) daily of wastewater containing 30 ppm H_2PO^-_4? (1 pound = 453.59 g.)

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about phosphate removal from sewage. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The reaction given is:
5H2O + H2PO4^- + MgO + NH4^+ → Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O

And the question is about calculating the theoretical amount of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O produced when processing a certain amount of wastewater. The wastewater has 5 million gallons daily, and the phosphate concentration is 30 ppm. Oh wait, and the given data includes that 1 pound is 453.59 grams.

So, first, I think I need to find out how much phosphate (as H2PO4^-) is present in the wastewater. Then, using the stoichiometry of the reaction, find out how much of the precipitate is formed.

Wait, but the problem says the city processes 41.7 million pounds of wastewater daily. Oh wait, the 5 million gallons is converted to 41.7 million pounds, so maybe I don't need to convert gallons to pounds, because it's already given. Oh, because 5 million gallons equals 41.7 million pounds. That's a big number.

So, the concentration is 30 ppm. ppm usually stands for parts per million, which I think is mg per kg or mg/L. Wait, since the units here are in pounds, I'm a bit confused. Oh, but maybe in the US, ppm can mean pounds per million pounds, or perhaps it's mg per liter. Hmm, but here, the problem gives the concentration as 30 ppm H2PO4^-, so I'll have to figure out the mass of H2PO4^- in the wastewater.

Wait, but let me think about this. If the solution is 30 ppm, that's 30 parts per million. So if it's ppm by mass, that's 30 mg per kg. But wait, the total weight of the wastewater is 41.7 million pounds. So I need to calculate how much phosphate is in that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to convert everything into SI units. Let's see: 41.7 million pounds. Since 1 pound is 453.59 grams, 41.7e6 lb * 453.59 g/lb = let's calculate that. 41.7e6 * 453.59 = let's see, 41.7e6 is 4.17e7, times 453.59. Hmm, well, maybe I can compute that as 41.7e6 *453.59 = ?

Wait, 41.7 million is 41,700,000 lb. So 41,700,000 *453.59 g = let's compute that. Let me approximate:

453.59 is approx 4.5359e2. So 4.17e7 lb * 4.5359e2 g/lb = (4.17 *4.5359)e9 g. Let me compute 4.17 *4.5359. 4*4.5 is 18, 0.17*4.5 is 0.765, 4*0.0359 is 0.1436, and 0.17 *0.0359 is about 0.0061. So adding up, 18 + 0.765 is 18.765, plus 0.1436 is 18.9086, plus 0.0061 is 18.9147. So approximately 18.9147e9 grams, which is 1.89147e10 grams, or about 1.891e10 g.

Wait, but maybe I should just calculate it properly. Let's do 41,700,000 lb *453.59 g/lb:

41,700,000 * 453.59 = let's calculate:

Compute 41,700,000 * 400 = 16,680,000,000

Then 41,700,000 * 53.59 = ?

Wait, 53.59 is 50 +3.59.

41,700,000 *50 = 2,085,000,000

41,700,000 *3.59 = let's compute that.

3 *41,700,000 = 125,100,000

0.59 *41,700,000 = ?

0.5 *41,700,000 = 20,850,000

0.09 *41,700,000 = 3,753,000

So 20,850,000 +3,753,000 =24,603,000

So 3.59 *41.7e6 =125,100,000 +24,603,000 =149,703,000

So 53.59 *41.7e6 =2,085e6 + 149,703e3 = Wait, 2,085,000,000 + 149,703,000 =2,234,703,000.

Then total is 16,680,000,000 +2,234,703,000 =18,914,703,000 grams. So about 1.89147e10 grams, or 18,914,703 kg (since 1 kg is 1000 g). Wait, no, 1e3 g = 1 kg, so 1.89147e10 g is 1.89147e7 kg. Wait, wait, 18,914,703,000 grams is 18,914,703,000 / 1000 = 18,914,703 kg. Wait, no, wait, 41.7 million pounds is 41,700,000 lb. Wait, 1 lb is 453.59 g, so 41,700,000 *453.59 g = let's see, 41,700,000 *453.59 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to convert million pounds to kg. Let's see, 1 lb is 0.45359 kg. So 41.7 million lb is 41.7e6 lb *0.45359 kg/lb = 41.7e6 *0.45359 kg.

Compute 41.7e6 *0.45359:

Calculate 41.7 *0.45359 first. 40*0.45359 is 18.1436, 1.7*0.45359 is approximately 0.7712. So total is 18.1436 +0.7712 =18.9148. So 41.7e6 lb is 18.9148e6 kg, so 1.89148e7 kg, or 18,914,800 kg.

Wait, that's the total mass of the wastewater. So the concentration is 30 ppm, which is 30 mg per kg, I think, assuming ppm is mg/kg. Because in water, 1 ppm (mass) is 1 mg per kg.

Wait, but wait, another way: 30 ppm could be 30 mg per liter, but in that case, since the density of water is about 1 kg/L, so 1 mg/L is 1 ppm. So perhaps 30 ppm is 30 mg/L.

Wait, but the problem says the concentration is 30 ppm H2PO4^-, so it's 30 mg per liter, or 30 mg/kg (since 1L water is ~1kg).

So the total mass of H2PO4^- is concentration (mg/L) multiplied by volume (L). But wait, the city processes 5 million gallons per day. Hmm.

Wait, the problem statement says the city processes 5 million gal (41.7 million lb) daily. So perhaps it's easier to work in pounds or kg.

But perhaps I should calculate the mass of H2PO4^- in the wastewater first.

So, the concentration is 30 ppm (mg per kg) of H2PO4^-. The total mass of wastewater is 41.7e6 lb, which we converted to kg as 1.89148e7 kg.

So, 30 ppm means 30 mg per kg of H2PO4^-.

So, the total mass of H2PO4^- would be 30 mg/kg * 1.89148e7 kg.

Wait, 30 mg/kg is 0.03 g/kg. So 0.03 g/kg *1.89148e7 kg = 0.03 *1.89148e7 = 5.6744e5 grams, which is 567.44 kg of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but let me double-check:

30 mg/kg * 1.89148e7 kg = 30e-3 g/kg * 1.89148e7 kg = (30e-3 *1.89148e7) g = 30 *1.89148e4 /1e3 = 30 * 18914.8e3 /1e3? Wait, no, perhaps I should compute it as:

30 mg/kg = 0.03 g/kg.

So 0.03 g/kg * 1.89148e7 kg = 0.03 *1.89148e7 = 5.6744e5 g, which is 567.44 kg.

So 567.44 kg of H2PO4^-.

Wait, but the molecular formula in the reaction is H2PO4^-. So each mole of H2PO4^- is part of one mole of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O.

Looking at the balanced chemical equation:

5H2O + H2PO4^- + MgO + NH4^+ → Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O.

So the stoichiometric ratio is 1 mole of H2PO4^- produces 1 mole of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O.

So moles of H2PO4^- = moles of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O.

So now, I need to find the molar mass of H2PO4^- and of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O.

Wait, but wait, H2PO4^- is the ion, but when calculating moles, I should consider it as H3PO4 (since H2PO4^- is the conjugate base). But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the acid form.

Wait, but the phosphate in solution is H2PO4^-; so the formula is H2PO4^-.

The molar mass of H2PO4^- would be: H2 is 2*(1.008) =2.016, P is 30.974, O4 is 16*4=64. So total is 2.016 +30.974 +64 = about 97 g/mol.

Wait, more accurately:

H: 1.008 *2 =2.016

P:30.974

O:16 *4=64

Total: 2.016 +30.974 =33, +64=97. So yes, 97 g/mol.

So moles of H2PO4^- is mass / molar mass =567.44 kg / 0.097 kg/mol (since 97 g/mol is 0.097 kg/mol).

Wait, 567.44 kg is 567440 g. So 567440 g /97 g/mol ≈ let me compute that.

97 g/mol is 0.097 kg/mol.

567440 g ÷ 97 g/mol = (567440 ÷97) mol.

Let me compute 567440 ÷97.

97 × 5852 = let's see: 97 × 5000=485,000. 97 × 800=77,600. 97 ×52=5044. So 485,000 +77,600 =562,600 +5,044=567,644. Oh wait, that's 97 ×5852 =567,644. But I have 567,440 g, which is 204 less than 567,644. So 567,440 ÷97=5852 - (204/97) → 5852 -2.102=5849.898 ≈5849.9 mol.

So approximately 5849.9 moles of H2PO4^-.

Since the stoichiometry is 1:1, that's 5849.9 moles of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O.

Now, find the molar mass of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O.

Let me compute that.

Mg: 24.305 g/mol

(NH4): 14.007 + 1.008*4 =14.007 +4.032=18.039 g/mol

PO4: 30.974 +16*4=30.974+64=94.974 g/mol

6H2O: 6*(2*1.008 +16.00)=6*(2.016 +16.00)=6*18.016=108.096 g/mol

Wait, but wait, the formula is Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O. So:

Mg:24.305

NH4:18.039

PO4:94.974

6H2O:108.096

So adding all together:

24.305 +18.039 =42.344

42.344 +94.974 =137.318

137.318 +108.096 =245.414 g/mol.

So molar mass is approximately 245.414 g/mol.

So moles of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O is 5849.9 mol.

Mass is moles × molar mass =5849.9 mol ×245.414 g/mol.

Let me compute this:

First, 5000 mol ×245.414 g/mol =1,227,070 g.

800 mol ×245.414 =196,331.2 g.

49.9 mol ×245.414 ≈ let's compute 50 ×245.414 =12,270.7, but subtract 0.1 ×245.414=24.5414 →12,270.7 -24.54 ≈12,246.16 g.

So total mass is 1,227,070 +196,331.2=1,423,401.2 +12,246.16≈1,435,647.36 grams.

Convert grams to kg: 1,435,647.36 g =1,435.647 kg.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B is 5852 kg, which is about 5,852 kg. Hmm, that's a lot higher.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, I have 5849.9 moles of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O, each with a molar mass of 245.414 g/mol. So 5849.9 *245.414.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Calculate 5849.9 ×245.414.

Let's break it down:

5849.9 ×200 =1,169,980

5849.9 ×40 =233,996

5849.9 ×5=29,249.5

5849.9 ×0.414= let's compute 5849.9 ×0.4=2,339.96 and 5849.9 ×0.014≈81.6986; sum is 2,339.96+81.6986≈2,421.6586.

Now add all parts:

1,169,980 +233,996 =1,403,976

1,403,976 +29,249.5 =1,433,225.5

1,433,225.5 +2,421.6586≈1,435,647.16 g ≈1,435.647 kg.

So approximately 1,435.65 kg.

Looking at the options, I see option C is 1.433 ×10^4 kg, which is 14,330 kg. Hmm, that's 10 times more than my calculation. Did I make a mistake in the stoichiometry or the initial mass?

Wait, let me retrace my steps.

Wait, the given data says 5 million gallons is 41.7 million pounds. So the total mass of wastewater is 41.7e6 lb. I converted that to kg by multiplying by 0.45359 kg/lb, getting 1.89148e7 kg.

Then, the concentration is 30 ppm H2PO4^-, which I took as 30 mg/kg. So mass of H2PO4^- is 30 mg/kg *1.89148e7 kg =567,440 mg =567.44 kg.

Wait, 30 mg/kg *1.89148e7 kg = (30e-3 g/kg) *1.89148e7 kg = 30e-3 *1.89148e7 = 5.6744e5 g, which is 567.44 kg.

Then, moles of H2PO4^- is 567,440 g /97 g/mol =5849.9 mol.

Molar mass of Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O is 245.414 g/mol.

So mass is 5849.9 mol ×245.414 g/mol =1,435,647 g =1,435.65 kg.

So that would be 1,435.65 kg, which is approximately 1.436e3 kg.

Looking at the options:

Option E is 1.433 ×10^3 kg, which is 1,433 kg.

Hmm, very close to my calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a small error in the molar masses.

Let me double-check the molar masses.

H2PO4^-:

H:2×1.008=2.016

P:30.974

O:4×16=64

Total:2.016+30.974=33, +64=97.0 g/mol. So that's correct.

Mg(NH4)PO4·6H2O:

Mg:24.305

NH4:14.01 (N) + (1.008×4)=4.032 →14.01+4.032=18.042

PO4:30.974 + (16×4)=64 →30.974+64=94.974

6H2O:6×(2×1.008 +16.00) →6×(2.016 +16.00)=6×18.016=108.096

Total:24.305 +18.042 =42.347 +94.974=137.321 +108.096=245.417 g/mol.

So that's correct.

Then, 5849.9 moles ×245.417 g/mol = 5849.9 ×245.417.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Wait, 5849.9 ×245.417.

Let me compute
