Question:

When an adult mouse or bird is castrated,itssexual behaviorvirtually disappears. Compare the effects of castrationof highly developed primates with the less developedanimals.

Options:

A: Castration has no significant impact on sexual behavior in any animals, regardless of their level of development
B: Castration leads to an increase in sexual behavior in higher primates
C: Castration in higher primates reduces aggression but has no effect on sexual behavior
D: In higher primates such as man, castration does not affect the ability to perform the sexual act, provided the male is sexually mature and experienced. This is because the behavior has been learned through experience.
E: Castration in higher primates leads to a temporary disruption of sexual behavior, which is quickly restored
F: Castration stops all sexual behavior in higher primates
G: In higher primates, castration results in a change in the preference of sexual partners
H: Castration alters the learning ability of animals
I: Castration enhances the learning ability of animals regarding sexual behavior
J: Castration has the same effect in all animals

Okay, so I have this question about the effects of castration on sexual behavior in different animals, specifically comparing higher primates to less developed ones. Hmm, I remember that in lower animals like mice or birds, when they're castrated, their sexual behavior almost disappears. That's because, I think, their behavior is mainly driven by hormones, especially testosterone from the testes. So without those hormones, the behavior stops.

But the question is about higher primates, like humans or maybe chimpanzees. I'm trying to recall what I learned in biology or psychology. I think in humans, sexual behavior isn't just about instinct but also about learning and experiences. So if a person is castrated, like in the past when eunuchs were made, they can still engage in sexual activities, but their sex drive might decrease because of lower testosterone. But wait, some sources mention that sexual function can remain if they've gone through puberty, because the neural pathways are already established.

So looking at the options, let's go through each one. Option A says no impact in any animal, which can't be right because we know it affects mice. Option B says increased behavior in higher primates, which doesn't make sense because castration removes the main source of testosterone, so it should reduce, not increase.

Option C says it reduces aggression but not sexual behavior. I think aggression is linked to testosterone, so maybe that part is true. But the sexual behavior part, I'm not sure. Some studies show that sexual behavior decreases but doesn't stop because of other factors like learning.

Option D says in higher primates, castration doesn't affect performance if the male is mature and experienced. That sounds familiar, like because they've learned the behavior, it remains even without the hormones. I think this is correct because the behavior is more influenced by past experiences and learning, not just hormones.

Option E says temporary disruption, which I don't think is the case. Once the hormones are gone, the effect is more long-term. Option F says it stops all behavior, which doesn't fit with what I remember about humans still being able to perform. Option G is about partner preference, which I don't think is directly linked to castration effects. H and I talk about learning ability, which I don't think is the main point here. J says same effect in all animals, which is wrong because higher primates are different.

So based on this, the correct answer should be D. Castration doesn't affect the ability to perform the sexual act in experienced males because the behavior is learned.

The question compares the effects of castration on sexual behavior in higher primates versus less developed animals. In lower animals, such as mice or birds, castration virtually eliminates sexual behavior due to their strong reliance on hormonal drivers like testosterone. In higher primates, including humans, sexual behavior is influenced by both hormones and learned experiences. While castration reduces sex drive by lowering testosterone levels, individuals who are sexually mature and experienced can still perform sexual acts because the behavior is partially learned and not entirely dependent on hormones.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because castration does impact sexual behavior in many animals.
- **B** is incorrect as castration reduces, rather than increases, sexual behavior.
- **C** is partially correct about aggression but incorrect regarding the absence of effects on sexual behavior.
- **D** is correct because it accurately describes how castration in higher primates does not eliminate sexual behavior in mature, experienced individuals due to learned behaviors.
- **E**, **F**, and **G** are incorrect as they misrepresent the effects of castration.
- **H**, **I**, and **J** are irrelevant or incorrect in this context.

Thus, the correct answer is **D**.

Answer: D
