Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about cream of tartar and baking powder reacting with hot water, producing carbon dioxide gas. The equation given is:

NaHCO3 + KHC4H6O6 → NaKC4H4O6 + H2O + CO2 (g)

They're asking, if 4.2 grams of NaHCO3 are used, what volume of CO2 is liberated at 273°C. Oh wait, wait. Wait, 273°C? No, wait, 273 K is 0°C, right? Because 0°C is 273.15 K. So the temperature here is probably 273 K. But wait, the problem says 273°C? That can't be right. Because 273°C is way too hot—like over 500°F. But maybe it's a typo, because in gas problems, standard temperature is often 273 K (0°C), and standard pressure is 1 atm. So I'll proceed under the assumption that it's 273 K, maybe the question had a typo. Or perhaps I should read it again.

Wait, the question says "at 273°C", but that's probably a mistake because 273°C is extremely high. Maybe it's supposed to be 273 K. But I'll proceed with that in mind.

The options are A through J, with various volumes and moles. So, first, I think I need to calculate how many moles of NaHCO3 are in 4.2 grams. Then, using the balanced equation, find out how many moles of CO2 are produced, and then convert that to volume at the given temperature.

Let me start by finding the molar mass of NaHCO3. Sodium bicarbonate. So Na is about 23 g/mol, H is 1, C is 12, O is 16. So NaHCO3: 23 + 1 + 12 + (3×16). Let me calculate that:

23 (Na) +1 (H) +12 (C) = 36. Then O3 is 3×16=48. So 36+48=84 g/mol. So molar mass is 84 g/mol.

Wait wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Na is 22.99, H is 1.008, C is 12.01, O is 16.00. So more accurately:

Na: 22.99
H: 1.008
C: 12.01
O3: 3×16=48.

So 22.99 + 1.008 = 24.00, plus 12.01 is 36.01, plus 48 is 84.01 g/mol. So approximately 84 g/mol.

So 4.2 grams of NaHCO3 is 4.2 / 84.01 moles. Let me compute that.

4.2 / 84 is 0.05 moles. Because 84 × 0.05 is 4.2. So yes, 0.05 moles of NaHCO3.

Now, looking at the balanced equation: the reaction is 1:1. One mole of NaHCO3 produces one mole of CO2. So 0.05 moles of NaHCO3 will produce 0.05 moles of CO2.

But wait, is the equation balanced? Let me check:

NaHCO3 + KHC4H6O6 → NaKC4H4O6 + H2O + CO2.

Let's count each element on both sides.

Left side: Na, K, H in HCO3, H in KHC4H6O6, etc.

Wait, maybe I should balance it, but the problem provides the equation, so perhaps it's already balanced. But I'm not sure. Wait, let me check.

Looking at the equation as written:

NaHCO3 + KHC4H6O6 → NaKC4H4O6 + H2O + CO2.

Let me count each element:

Na: Left has 1 (NaHCO3), right has 1 (NaKC4H4O6). So Na is balanced.

K: Left has 1 (KHC4H6O6), right has 1 (NaKC4H4O6). Balanced.

H: Let's see. Left side: in NaHCO3, there's 1 H. In KHC4H6O6, there's 1 (from KH) + 6 (from C4H6O6) = 7 H. So total H on left: 8.

Right side: NaKC4H4O6 has 4 H, H2O has 2 H, CO2 has none. So 4 + 2 = 6 H. Hmm, that's a problem. So the equation isn't balanced because H is 8 on the left and 6 on the right.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount.

Wait, KHC4H6O6: the formula is KHC4H4O6? Wait, no, the product is NaKC4H4O6, and the reactant is KHC4H6O6.

Wait, perhaps I should write the formulas correctly. The reactant is potassium hydrogen tartrate, KHC4H4O6. Hmm, but wait, that's the product. Wait, the reactant is KHC4H6O6. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong, but perhaps the main point is the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is balanced as written, but I'm miscounting.

Let me approach it again.

Left side:

NaHCO3: Na=1, H=1, C=1, O=3.

KHC4H6O6: K=1, H= (1 + 6) =7? Or is it H in the hydrogen tartrate? Wait, KHC4H6O6 would be potassium hydrogen tartrate, which has the formula KHC4H4O6. Wait, maybe the formula is correct as KHC4H6O6. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, but I'll proceed with the given formula.

So in KHC4H6O6: K=1, H= (1 +6) =7, C=4, O=6.

So total on the left:

Na:1, K:1, H:1 (from NaHCO3) +7 (from KHC4H6O6) =8, C:1 (from NaHCO3) +4 (from KHC4H6O6)=5, O:3 (from NaHCO3) +6 (from KHC4H6O6)=9.

On the right side:

NaKC4H4O6: Na=1, K=1, C=4, H=4, O=6.

H2O: H=2, O=1.

CO2: C=1, O=2.

So total on the right:

Na:1, K:1.

C:4 (from NaKC4H4O6) +1 (from CO2) =5.

H:4 (from NaKC4H4O6) +2 (from H2O) =6.

O:6 (from NaKC4H4O6) +1 (from H2O) +2 (from CO2) =9.

So O is balanced: 9 on both sides.

C: 5 on both sides.

Na and K: 1 each.

H: left is 8, right is 6. So that's not balanced. Hmm, so the equation isn't balanced as written.

Wait, but the problem states that the equation is as given. Maybe it's a typo in the problem, but perhaps in the reaction, the coefficients are such that the equation is balanced. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, maybe KHC4H6O6 is KHC4H4O6·H2O or something else? Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the stoichiometry between NaHCO3 and CO2, since that's what the problem is about.

Wait, in the reaction, 1 mole of NaHCO3 produces 1 mole of CO2, so the mole ratio is 1:1, regardless of other elements. So perhaps the H and O are balanced through other products. So perhaps the equation is balanced with a 1:1 ratio between NaHCO3 and CO2.

So, if that's the case, then 0.05 moles of NaHCO3 will produce 0.05 moles of CO2.

Now, the next step is to find the volume of CO2 at the given temperature and pressure.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the pressure, but it's common to assume standard conditions (1 atm) unless stated otherwise. But the temperature is given as 273°C, which as I thought earlier, is extremely high. But perhaps it's a typo, and the intended temperature is 0°C (273 K). Because at 273 K and 1 atm, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. That's standard conditions.

Wait, but if it's 273°C, which is 546 K, then the volume would be larger because gas volume increases with temperature if pressure is constant.

So, the problem is either at 273 K or 273°C. But let's think: 273°C is 0°C in Kelvin? No, wait, 0°C is 273 K, 100°C is 373 K. So 273°C is 546 K (273 + 273). But the question says 273°C. Hmm. But that's a very high temperature, and in such cases, gases expand a lot.

But in the options, the volumes are all around 22.4 L (option C) or 11.2 L (A), 5.6 (J), etc. Wait, 22.4 is standard molar volume at 273 K.

So perhaps the intended temperature is 273 K, not 273°C. Because 273°C is way beyond standard conditions, and the options don't include very large volumes.

So I'll proceed under the assumption that the temperature is 273 K, and pressure is 1 atm. So, at these conditions, 1 mole of CO2 occupies 22.4 liters.

So 0.05 moles would occupy 0.05 × 22.4 L = 1.12 liters.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.12 L, option E is 2.24, which is 0.1 moles ×22.4. So our calculation is 0.05 ×22.4=1.12 L.

Wait, but wait, what if the temperature is indeed 273°C? Then, the volume would be significantly higher. Let me think about that.

At higher temperatures, the volume increases. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT.

At 273 K, n=1, P=1 atm, V=22.4 L.

At 546 K (273°C), keeping pressure at 1 atm, the volume would be V = nRT/P. So because T is doubled, V would double. So at 546 K, 1 mole would occupy 44.8 L.

So 0.05 moles would be 0.05 × 44.8 = 2.24 L.

Looking at the options, E is 2.24 L.

Hmm, so depending on the temperature, the answer changes. So the problem says 273°C, which is 546 K, but that would give 2.24 L, which is option E.

Wait, but the standard molar volume is at 273 K (0°C), 1 atm. If the problem uses 273°C, then the volume is higher.

So now I'm a bit confused. The problem states 273°C, but the options include 1.12 L (D) and 2.24 (E). So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the temperature. Let me think again: 0°C is 273 K. 273°C would be 546 K. So if the temperature is 273°C, which is 546 K, then the volume is V = nRT/P.

At standard pressure (1 atm), R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So for n=0.05, T=546 K.

V = (0.05 × 0.0821 × 546) / 1.

Let me compute that:

0.05 × 0.0821 = 0.004105.

0.004105 × 546 ≈ 2.24 liters.

So yes, that's 2.24 L, which is option E.

But wait, the problem asks for the volume at 273°C, which is 546 K, so the answer would be 2.24 L, option E.

But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the question says "at 273°C". So that's the temperature we should use.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 273°C is quite high, and in real-world scenarios, reactions like baking might not occur at such high temps. Also, the options include 1.12 L (D), which is the volume at 273 K.

So perhaps the problem intended 273 K, but wrote 273°C by mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps it's written correctly, and I should proceed with 273°C.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to assume standard temperature (273 K) regardless of what's written. Because in gas stoichiometry, STP is usually 273 K.

But the question explicitly says 273°C, which complicates things.

Wait, let's read the question again: "what volume of CO2 should be liberated through the dough at 273°C?"

Hmm. So perhaps the reaction occurs at 273°C, which is a high temperature, and the gas is released at that temperature. So, under those conditions, we must calculate the volume.

So, to compute the volume at 273°C (546 K), we can't use the 22.4 L/mol approximation because that's only valid at 273 K.

So, using the ideal gas law:

PV = nRT

Assuming pressure is 1 atm (standard pressure), so P=1 atm.

n = 0.05 moles.

R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

T = 546 K.

So V = (0.05 mol)(0.0821 L·atm/mol·K)(546 K) / 1 atm.

Let me compute that:

0.05 × 0.0821 = 0.004105.

0.004105 × 546 = ?

Let me compute 0.004105 × 500 = 2.0525.

Then 0.004105 × 46 = let's see:

0.004105 ×40 = 0.1642.

0.004105 ×6=0.02463.

Total 0.1642 +0.02463=0.18883.

So total V≈2.0525 +0.18883≈2.2413 liters.

Which is approximately 2.24 liters. So option E is 2.24 L.

So the correct answer would be E.

But wait, let's check the options again. Option E is 2.24 L. Option D is 1.12 L.

So, if the temperature is 273 K, answer is D. If it's 273°C, answer is E.

But the problem says 273°C, so the answer should be E.

But wait, in the initial question, the equation is written as CO2 (g) with an upward arrow, indicating gas is evolved. So the reaction is under certain conditions where the gas is released.

Wait, but if the dough is at 273°C, that's like a very hot condition. But perhaps in the problem, they're assuming standard conditions (0°C) for the volume, even though the reaction occurs at higher temp. Hmm, but the question says "at 273°C", so the volume should be measured at that temperature.

So, because the problem specifies 273°C, the volume would be 2.24 L, option E.

But looking back, I think I made a mistake in the assumption about the reaction's stoichiometry. Let me make sure the mole ratio is correct.

The reaction is NaHCO3 + KHC4H6O6 → NaKC4H4O6 + H2O + CO2.

So the mole ratio of NaHCO3 to CO2 is 1:1.

So 0.05 moles NaHCO3 → 0.05 moles CO2.

So that's correct.

Now, if the question had been at 273 K, the volume would be 1.12 L, option D. But with 273°C, it's 2.24 L, option E.

But I'm a bit confused because 273°C is not standard, but the problem explicitly states it. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended 0°C, but wrote 273°C by mistake. But without knowing, I have to go with what's written.

Wait, perhaps another approach: if the problem expects standard temperature (273 K), then the answer would be D. But if it's 273°C, it's E.

But the options include both. So I'm a bit torn.

Wait, perhaps I should check the molar volume at 273°C and 1 atm. Because 1 mole at STP (273 K) is 22.4 L, but at 273°C (546 K), it's 44.8 L. So 0.05 moles ×44.8 L/mol = 2.24 L. So that's E.

So I think the correct answer is E: 2.24 L.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the number of moles of NaHCO₃ using its molar mass. The molar mass of NaHCO₃ is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass of NaHCO}_3 = 22.99 \, (\text{Na}) + 1.008 \, (\text{H}) + 12.01 \, (\text{C}) + 3 \times 16.00 \, (\text{O}) = 84.01 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

Given 4.2 g of NaHCO₃, the number of moles is:

\[
\text{Moles of NaHCO}_3 = \frac{4.2}{84.01} \approx 0.05 \, \text{moles}.
\]

From the balanced chemical equation:

\[
\text{NaHCO}_3 + \text{KHC}_4\text{H}_6\text{O}_6 \rightarrow \text{NaKC}_4\text{H}_4
