Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about finding the half-life of polonium given a certain ratio of polonium to uranium atoms. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows certain laws, probably the one involving the decay constant or half-life.

Alright, the problem states that there's approximately 1 polonium-214 atom for every 8.7e20 uranium-238 nuclei. So the ratio is 1 Po-214 to 8.7e20 U-238. I think this has to do with the decay series. Oh right, uranium decays into thorium, which then decays into protactinium, and so on, until it reaches lead, I believe. Polonium is one of the elements in that decay chain.

Since both are part of the same decay series, they must be in secular equilibrium, but wait, is that the case here? Wait, secular equilibrium occurs when the half-life of the parent is much longer than that of the daughter. If the parent has a much longer half-life, the amount of daughter produced equals the amount decaying. But if the parent and daughter have comparable half-lives, secular equilibrium doesn't apply, and we have to use the Bateman equation or something similar.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Uranium-238 has a very long half-life, around 4.5 billion years. So its decay is slow. Polonium-214, on the other hand, has a much shorter half-life. So in this case, the decay chain would go from U-238 to Th-234, Pa-234, and so on until Po-214. Since the parent (U-238) has a much longer half-life than Po-214, the activity of Po-214 should reach equilibrium with the activity of U-238.

In secular equilibrium, the activity (which is the product of the number of nuclei and the decay constant) of all the decay products becomes equal. So the activity of Po-214 equals the activity of U-238. Activity is given by A = λN, where λ is the decay constant and N is the number of atoms.

Wait, but when a parent decays into a daughter which then decays, the number of daughter nuclei relates to the parent's decay rate. So the number of daughter nuclei N2 is given by N2 = (λ1/λ2) * N1, where λ1 is the decay constant of the parent, and λ2 that of the daughter. But wait, that's only when the parent and daughter are in secular equilibrium, which is when the half-life of the parent is much longer than that of the daughter, so that the daughter's activity equals the parent's.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this right. The condition for secular equilibrium is that the half-life of the parent is much longer than the daughter's. So in that case, the daughter's activity equals the parent's activity. But the number of atoms depends on their decay constants.

So for secular equilibrium, the number of daughter atoms N2 is (λ1 / λ2) * N1. Because in equilibrium, A2 = A1 → λ2 N2 = λ1 N1 → N2 = (λ1 / λ2) N1.

But in this problem, we have the number of Po-214 atoms (N2) being 1, and the number of U-238 (N1) being 8.7e20. Wait, but wait—U-238 decays into Th-234, not directly into Po-214. So perhaps the decay chain is longer. So the initial isotope is U-238, which decays through several steps to Po-214. So the entire decay chain is U-238 → Th-234 → Pa-234 → U-233? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the decay steps wrong. Let me think about the decay series.

Uranium-238 decays via alpha emission to Thorium-234. Then Th-234 beta decays to Protactinium-234, which then beta decays to Uranium-234. Uranium-234 alpha decays to Thorium-230. Th-230 alpha decays to Radium-226, which then alpha decays to Radon-222. Radon-222 alpha decays to Polonium-218, which alpha decays to Lead-214, then beta to Bismuth-214, and beta again to Polonium-214, which alpha decays to Lead-210, and so on.

Wait, so Po-214 is part of the decay chain, but it's several steps down from U-238. So the direct parent of Po-214 is probably Ra-226 or Rn-222. Wait, no, let me recheck. The decay chain for U-238:

U-238 → Th-234 (α)
Th-234 → Pa-234 (β)
Pa-234 → U-234 (β)
U-234 → Th-230 (α)
Th-230 → Ra-226 (α)
Ra-226 → Rn-222 (α)
Rn-222 → Po-218 (α)
Po-218 → Pb-214 (α)
Pb-214 → Bi-214 (β)
Bi-214 → Po-214 (β)
Po-214 → Pb-210 (α)

So the parent of Po-214 is Bi-214, which comes from Pb-214. But in any case, each step has its own half-life. Hmm, but this complicates things. Because each step's half-life affects the number of atoms present.

Wait, but if all the intermediate isotopes have much shorter half-lives than U-238, then each subsequent isotope's activity would be in equilibrium with the previous one. So the activity of each daughter is equal to the activity of the parent. But if any of the intermediates have longer half-lives, that could affect the equilibrium.

But let's think: U-238 has a half-life of ~4.5e9 years. Th-234 has a half-life of about 24 days. Pa-234 has a half-life of about 1.2 minutes. U-234 has ~2.5e5 years. Th-230 has ~7.5e4 years. Ra-226 has ~1600 years. Rn-222 has ~3.8 days. Po-218 has ~3 minutes. Pb-214 has ~26.8 minutes. Bi-214 has ~19.9 minutes. Po-214 has ~164.3 microseconds? Wait no, Po-214's half-life is actually about 164 microseconds, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, I think I'm mixing up the isotopes. Let me check:

Wait, Po-214 (Polonium-214) has a half-life of about 164.3 microseconds. That's extremely short. But wait, the given ratio is 1 Po-214 atom per 8.7e20 U-238 atoms. If Po-214's half-life is that short, it would decay almost immediately, so the ratio would be extremely low. But the problem says there's 1 Po-214 atom for every 8.7e20 U-238. So perhaps I made a mistake in the decay chain.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing Po-210 with Po-214. Oh wait, no, Po-210 has a half-life of about 138 days. Po-214, as I said, is much shorter. So maybe the decay chain I'm considering isn't correct, but perhaps the problem is considering a different decay path. Alternatively, perhaps this is a made-up scenario, and I shouldn't get bogged down in real decay chains.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a simplified model, treating U-238 as the parent and Po-214 as a granddaughter, but with multiple steps, but assuming all intermediates are in equilibrium.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the only decay is U-238 → Th-234 → ... → Po-214, and that all the intermediates have such short half-lives that they don't accumulate, so the only relevant isotopes are U-238 and Po-214, with Po-214 being the daughter.

Wait, but that's unlikely, because the intermediates would have their own decay constants. So perhaps the problem is using the assumption that all the decay products except Po-214 and U-238 are in secular equilibrium, and their decay constants are much larger (so they don't accumulate), leaving the ratio between U-238 and Po-214 determined by their decay constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering Po-214 as the direct daughter of U-238, which isn't the case, but assuming it for the sake of the problem.

Wait, but perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the system is in secular equilibrium, meaning that the activity of Po-214 equals that of U-238. Activity A = λN.

Given that, let me set up the equations. Let N_1 be the number of U-238 atoms, and N_2 the number of Po-214 atoms.

So, A1 = λ1 N1 = decay constant of U-238 times number of U-238 atoms.

A2 = λ2 N2 = decay constant of Po-214 times number of Po-214 atoms.

In secular equilibrium, A1 = A2, so:

λ1 N1 = λ2 N2 → N2 = (λ1 / λ2) N1

We can rearrange this to solve for λ2:

λ2 = (λ1 N1) / N2

But wait, we don't know λ1 or λ2. Hmm, perhaps we can relate their half-lives. The decay constant λ is ln(2) divided by the half-life T: λ = ln2 / T.

So λ1 = ln2 / T1, where T1 is the half-life of U-238, which is about 4.5e9 years, which is 4.5e9 * 365 * 24 * 3600 seconds. Let's calculate that: 4.5e9 years * (approx 3.154e7 seconds/year) = 4.5e9 * 3.154e7 = 1.4193e17 seconds. But wait, let me compute it more accurately. 4.5e9 years * 365.25 days/year * 24 hours/day * 3600 seconds/hour.

Compute step by step:

4.5e9 yr * 365.25 d/yr = 4.5e9 * 3.6525e2 = 1.6461e12 d

1.6461e12 d * 24 h/d = 3.9506e13 h

3.9506e13 h * 3600 s/h = 1.4216e17 seconds.

So T1 = 4.5e9 years = ~1.4216e17 seconds.

So λ1 = ln2 / T1 ≈ 0.6931 / 1.4216e17 ≈ 4.876e-18 s^-1.

Now, we need to find λ2, the decay constant of Po-214. But we don't know T2, the half-life of Po-214, which is what we're trying to find.

From the secular equilibrium condition, we have N2 = (λ1 / λ2) * N1.

We can rearrange this to solve for λ2:

λ2 = (λ1 * N1) / N2

But let me plug in the numbers. N1 is given as 8.7e20 U-238 nuclei, and N2 is 1 Po-214 atom.

So N1 = 8.7e20, N2 = 1.

So λ2 = (λ1 * 8.7e20) / 1.

So λ2 = 4.876e-18 s^-1 * 8.7e20 = 4.876e-18 * 8.7e20 = let's compute that.

4.876 *8.7 = approx 42.4, and 1e-18 * 1e20 = 1e2.

So 42.4 * 1e2 = 4240 s^-1.

Wait, that gives λ2 ≈ 4240 s^-1.

But wait, that can't be right because the half-life would be T2 = ln2 / λ2.

So T2 = 0.6931 / 4240 ≈ 1.635e-4 seconds. That's 0.0001635 seconds, which is 0.164 milliseconds. That's way too short, but I thought Po-214 has a half-life of about 164 microseconds, which is 0.000164 seconds, so this matches.

Wait, but the problem is giving the ratio, and perhaps I'm correct. But looking at the options, the options are in the range of 1e3 to 1e5 seconds. So this would mean that my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that I'm assuming secular equilibrium, but perhaps the problem is not considering that. Maybe it's a simple decay problem where U-238 decays to Po-214 in one step, but that's unlikely because the decay chain is longer.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the number of Po-214 atoms is 1, while the number of U-238 is 8.7e20. So the ratio is N2/N1 = 1/(8.7e20) = 1.148e-21.

But using the decay equation:

N2 = N1 * (λ1 / (λ2 - λ1)) * (e^{-λ1 t} - e^{-λ2 t})

Wait, that's the Bateman equation for a decay chain. But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, if we're at secular equilibrium, the exponential terms go to 1, and we can ignore them. But perhaps that's not the case here.

Wait, but if U-238 has a much longer half-life than Po-214, then after a long time, the system reaches secular equilibrium. So the ratio of N2/N1 would be λ1/(λ2). Because in equilibrium, N2 = (λ1 / λ2) * N1.

So N2/N1 = λ1/λ2.

We have N2/N1 = 1/(8.7e20) = approx 1.148e-21.

So λ1/λ2 ≈ 1.148e-21.

But λ1 is 4.876e-18 s^-1, so λ2 = λ1 / 1.148e-21 = 4.876e-18 / 1.148e-21 ≈ 4.246e3 s^-1.

Then, T2 = ln2 / λ2 ≈ 0.6931 / 4246 ≈ 1.633e-4 seconds, which is about 0.163 milliseconds, which is 163 microseconds. Which matches what I thought earlier about Po-214's half-life.

But this doesn't match any of the options given. The options are all in the order of thousands to tens of thousands of seconds, which would be days or weeks. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about secular equilibrium. Maybe the rock sample is newly formed, so the half-life is calculated based on the decay of Po-214 relative to U-238. Alternatively, perhaps we need to consider the decay of Po-214 as a standalone isotope.

Wait, another approach: perhaps we can use the formula for radioactive decay in terms of the remaining quantity.

But we have two isotopes, so perhaps the ratio of their atoms is determined by their decay constants.

Wait, but both isotopes are decaying. So U-238 is decaying into Th-234, which then decays into Pa-234, and so on until Po-214. But if the system is in equilibrium, then the number of Po-214 atoms depends on the decay constants of all the isotopes in the chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a simple ratio without considering the decay chain, which might be incorrect, but perhaps that's the expected approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. Let me think of the decay constant of U-238 as λ_U and that of Po-214 as λ_Po.

In secular equilibrium, the rate of decay of U-238 equals the rate of decay of Po-214, so λ_U * N_U = λ_Po * N_Po.

We have N_Po = 1, N_U = 8.7e20.

So λ_Po = (λ_U * N_U) / N_Po = λ_U * 8.7e20.

But we can write λ_Po = ln2 / T_Po, and λ_U = ln2 / T_U.

So substituting, we have (ln2 / T_Po) = (ln2 / T_U) * 8.7e20.

Cancel ln2 from both sides: 1/T_Po = (8.7e20) / T_U.

Rearranging: T_Po = T_U / (8.7e20).

But wait, T_U is the half-life of U-238, which is 4.5e9 years, which is 1.4216e17 seconds.

So T_Po = 1.4216e17 s / 8.7e20 = approx 1.634e-4 seconds, which is 0.163 milliseconds. Which is 163 microseconds, which matches the known value of Po-214's half-life.

But the options don't have anything like that. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the question is asking about the half-life of Po-210 instead of Po-214? Because Po-210 has a half-life of about 138 days, which is around 1.3e7 seconds, but that's still not matching the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem gives the ratio of Po-214 atoms to U-238 as 1 to 8.7e20. So N_Po = 1, N_U = 8.7e20.

In secular equilibrium, N_Po = (λ_U / λ_Po) * N_U.

Wait, wait no, earlier I thought N2 = (λ1 / λ2) N1, but that's when A1 = A2 → λ1 N1 = λ2 N2 → N2 = (λ1 / λ2) N1.

So in this case, N_Po = (λ_U / λ_Po) * N_U.

So, λ_Po = (λ_U * N_U) / N_Po.

Which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering secular equilibrium but rather initial conditions. Suppose we start with some amount of U-238 and zero Po-214. Over time, Po-214 builds up as U-238 decays. But without knowing the time, that approach might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the ratio of atoms to calculate the decay constants. Let me think about the decay equations.

The number of atoms remaining after time t for a radioactive substance is
