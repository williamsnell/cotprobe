Alright, so I've got this question here about calculating the saturation concentration of oxygen in water exposed to dry air at 1 atm and 25°C. Okay, let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

First, I know Henry's Law is involved here. Henry's Law states that the concentration of a dissolved gas in a liquid is directly proportional to its partial pressure above the liquid. The formula I remember is C = kH * P, where C is the concentration, kH is Henry's constant, and P is the partial pressure of the gas.

Wait, but Henry's Law can be expressed in different ways. Oh right, sometimes it's written as P = kH * C, depending on the units. So I need to pay attention to the units given here. The question gives Henry's constant for dissolved oxygen as 4.12 × 10^9 (Pa / (mole of O2/total mole of solution)). Hmm, that's an unusual way to write the units. Let me think about that.

Wait, the units are (Pa) divided by (mole of O2 per total mole of solution). So kH has units of Pa·mol_solution/mol_O2. That might mean that the formula is rearranged. So if I want to find the concentration of O2 in solution, I should rearrange Henry's Law formula. Let's see: C = P / kH, where C is in mole of O2 per mole of solution.

But wait, the problem is asking for the concentration in mg per liter. So I'll eventually need to convert from mole fractions to that unit.

Next, the partial pressure of oxygen. The air is dry and at 1 atm. Air is mostly nitrogen and oxygen. The mole fraction of O2 in dry air is about 0.21, right? So the partial pressure of O2 is 0.21 times the total pressure. Since the total pressure is 1 atm, which is 101325 Pa. So P_O2 = 0.21 * 101325 Pa.

Let me calculate that. 0.21 * 101325. Let's see, 100,000 * 0.21 is 21,000, and 1325 * 0.21 is about 278.25. So total is approximately 21,278.25 Pa. I'll keep it as 21278.25 Pa for more accuracy.

Now, using Henry's Law, C = P / kH. Plugging in the numbers: C = 21278.25 Pa / (4.12e9 Pa·mol_solution/mol_O2). Let me compute that.

Wait, 4.12e9 is 4.12 × 10^9. So 21278.25 / 4.12e9 is roughly... Let's see, 21278.25 divided by 4.12e9. Let me do this step by step. 21278.25 ÷ 4.12 ≈ 5160. So 5160 ÷ 1e9 → 5.16e-6. So C is approximately 5.16e-6 mol O2 per total mole of solution.

But wait, I need to find the concentration in mg per liter. So I'll need to convert this mole fraction into mg/L.

Hmm, to convert from mole fraction to concentration in mg/L, I think I need to know the molar mass of water and oxygen. Let's see:

Molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol (since each O is 16 g/mol). The density of water is about 1000 kg/m³, which is 1 kg/L or 1 g/mL.

Wait, but how do I get from mole fraction to mg/L?

Alternatively, I might remember that the concentration can be calculated using the formula:

C (mg/L) = (C (mol O2/mol solution) * M_O2 * density of water) / (molar mass of water)

Wait, but wait, the solution's molar mass is approximately that of water, so maybe I can treat it as water for the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of moles of O2 dissolved per liter of water.

Wait, another approach: The concentration in solution can be expressed as C = (P_O2) / (kH) where C is in mol O2 per mol water. But to get mg/L, we can do:

C (mg/L) = (moles O2 per liter) * molar mass O2 (g/mol).

So first, let's find moles O2 per liter.

But wait, how many moles of water are in a liter? Since water is about 1000 g/L, and its molar mass is 18 g/mol, so moles of water = 1000 / 18 ≈ 55.56 mol.

So, the mole fraction of O2 is C = 5.16e-6 mol O2 per mol solution. So per liter, which has 55.56 mol water, the moles O2 would be 55.56 * 5.16e-6.

Let me compute that. 55.56 * 5.16e-6 = let's see, 55.56 * 5e-6 is 0.000278, and 55.56 * 0.16e-6 is 0.00000889. Adding them gives approximately 0.00028689 mol O2 per liter.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 5.16e-6 is per mole of solution. Since solution is almost all water, so per mole of solution is per mole of water. So if I have 55.56 mol of water in a liter, then the moles of O2 is 55.56 * 5.16e-6. Let me compute that again.

55.56 * 5.16e-6 = (55.56 * 5.16) * 1e-6.

55 * 5 is 275, 55 *0.16 is ~8.8, 0.56*5 is 2.8, 0.56*0.16≈0.09. So total is approximately 275 +8.8 = 283.8 + 2.8 = 286.6 +0.09 ≈286.69. So 286.69e-6 mol O2 per liter.

Wait, 286.69e-6 is 0.00028669 mol/L. Then, to convert to mg/L, multiply by the molar mass of O2, which is 32 g/mol.

So 0.00028669 mol/L * 32 g/mol = 0.00918 g/L, which is 9.18 mg/L.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, option G is 9.1792 mg/L. That's very close to my calculation. So maybe that's the answer.

But wait, let me double-check my steps because I might have made an error in unit conversions.

Alternative approach: Henry's Law in terms of concentration in mol/L.

Another formula I've heard is C = (P * M) / (R * T), but I'm not sure if that applies here. Wait, maybe that's for ideal gases, but perhaps Henry's Law can be expressed in different forms.

Wait, another way to think about this is using the solubility form. The solubility S (in mol/L) can be calculated as S = P / (kH * H), where H is Henry's constant. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up terms.

Wait, I think another approach is to use the Henry's Law formula where C = P / kH, with C in mol/L. But I think I'm getting confused with the units of Henry's constant.

Wait, I have to make sure about the units. The Henry's constant given is 4.12e9 Pa / (mol O2 / total mol solution). So the unit is Pa per (mole fraction). So, to find the mole fraction, X = P / kH.

So X = 21278.25 Pa / (4.12e9 Pa/(mol O2/mol solution)).

Calculating that: 21278.25 / 4.12e9 = 5.16e-6 mol O2 per mol solution.

Now, the solution is water, so per liter of solution, which is roughly 55.56 moles of water, the moles of O2 would be 55.56 mol_water * X ≈55.56 * 5.16e-6 ≈ 0.0002867 mol O2.

Then, convert that to mg: 0.0002867 mol * 32 g/mol = 0.00918 g, which is 9.18 mg. So, 9.18 mg/L.

Looking back at the options, option G is 9.1792 mg/L, which is very close. So that must be the correct answer.

To calculate the saturation concentration of oxygen in water exposed to dry air at 1 atm and 25°C, we use Henry's Law. Henry's Law states that the concentration of a dissolved gas is proportional to its partial pressure above the liquid. The formula is:

\[
C = \frac{P}{k_H}
\]

where:
- \(C\) is the concentration of dissolved oxygen (in mol O\(_2\)/mol solution),
- \(P\) is the partial pressure of oxygen,
- \(k_H\) is Henry's constant.

### Step 1: Calculate the partial pressure of oxygen (\(P_{\text{O}_2}\))
The mole fraction of oxygen in dry air is approximately 0.21. Since the total pressure is 1 atm (101325 Pa), the partial pressure of oxygen is:

\[
P_{\text{O}_2} = 0.21 \times 101325 = 21278.25 \, \text{Pa}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the mole fraction of oxygen (\(C\))
Using Henry's Law, the mole fraction of oxygen in water is:

\[
C = \frac{P_{\text{O}_2}}{k_H} = \frac{21278.25}{4.12 \times 10^9} \approx 5.16 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{mol O}_2/\text{mol solution}.
\]

### Step 3: Convert to concentration in mg/L
To convert the mole fraction to mg/L, we need:
- The molar mass of O\(_2\): \(32 \, \text{g/mol}\),
- The density of water: \(1 \, \text{g/mL} = 1000 \, \text{g/L}\),
- The molar mass of water: \(18 \, \text{g/mol}\).

The number of moles of water in 1 liter is:

\[
\text{Moles of water} = \frac{1000}{18} \approx 55.56 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of O\(_2\) in 1 liter are:

\[
\text{Moles of O}_2 = 55.56 \times 5.16 \times 10^{-6} \approx 0.0002867 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Convert moles of O\(_2\) to mg:

\[
\text{Mass of O}_2 = 0.0002867 \times 32 \approx 0.00918 \, \text{g} = 9.18 \, \text{mg}.
\]

Thus, the saturation concentration of oxygen in water is approximately:

\[
9.18 \, \text{mg/L}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to this value is **G: 9.1792 mg/L**.
