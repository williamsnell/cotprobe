Okay, so I've got this question about the molecular geometry of thionyl chloride, SOCl2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my VSEPR theory, but let me think this through step by step.

First off, I remember that molecular geometry is determined by the number of electron domains around the central atom, which includes both bonding pairs and lone pairs. So I need to figure out the structure of SOCl2.

The molecule is SOCl2. So the central atom is sulfur (S), right? Let's break it down. Sulfur is bonded to two chlorine atoms and has an oxygen double-bonded to it. Wait, no, wait. Wait, thionyl chloride is SOCl2. So, sulfur is the central atom with double bond to oxygen and single bonds to two chlorines. Oh wait, no! Wait, SOCl2 has S double bonded to O, and then two single bonds to Cl. But wait, actually, let me get the structure right. The formula is SOCl2, so sulfur is bonded to O and two Cls. So sulfur has three bonding regions: one double bond to O, and two single bonds to Cl. But wait, does that mean it has only three bonding pairs, or is the double bond considered as two pairs?

Wait, no. The VSEPR model counts each multiple bond as a single domain. So a double bond is still just one domain. So in this case, the sulfur has three bonding domains: one double bond (counts as one) and two single bonds (each counts as one). So that's three bonding domains. But what about lone pairs?

Sulfur in SOCl2. Let me think about the electron count. Sulfur has 6 valence electrons. Oxygen has 6, each Cl has 7. But let's do the Lewis structure properly.

So, SOCl2: the central S atom. Let's calculate the total valence electrons. S has 6, O has 6, each Cl has 7. So 6 + 6 + (2*7) = 6 + 6 +14=26 electrons.

Now, build the structure. S is the center. Let's connect S to O with a double bond (so that's 4 electrons used). Then S is connected to each Cl with a single bond (2 electrons each, so 4 total). So far, 4 (for S=O) + 4 (S-Cl) = 8 electrons used. But wait, wait, let's count correctly.

Wait, the correct approach is to subtract the bonding electrons from the total. So each single bond is 2 electrons, but in the Lewis structure, each bond is counted as 2. So let's see:

Each single bond contributes 2 electrons, but all bonds come from the central atom sharing electrons with others. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of total electrons.

Alternatively, another way: the total valence electrons is 26.

So, the structure: S is in the center. Let's form a double bond with O (sharing 4 electrons), and single bonds with each Cl (sharing 2 each, so 4 total). So bonding electrons used: 4 (S=O) + 4 (two S-Cl) = 8 electrons. So that's 8 electrons used for bonding. But the total is 26, so the remaining electrons are 26 - 8 = 18 electrons, which are lone pairs.

Now, distribute these as lone pairs. The O in S=O will have lone pairs. Let's see. Each O typically has two lone pairs in a double bond. Wait, no: in a double bond, O has two lone pairs. So, for O, double bond (sharing 4 electrons, so O contributes 4?), wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: each bond, whether single or double, counts as two electrons from each atom. So, in a single bond, each atom contributes one electron. In a double bond, each contributes two.

Wait no, that's not correct. Each bond is a sharing of two electrons, each atom contributing one. So in a double bond, each atom contributes two (so four electrons total in the bond).

But for Lewis structures, each bond counts as two electrons. So, when calculating the number of electrons used in bonding, each single bond is two, each double is four, etc.

So in SOCl2:

- S is bonded to O via double bond: 4 electrons.
- S is bonded to each Cl via single bond: 2 per bond, so 4 total.

So total bonding electrons: 4 +4 =8.

Total valence electrons:26. So 26 -8=18 electrons left as lone pairs.

Now, distribute these. Oxygen usually has two lone pairs in a double bond, but let me count. Oxygen has 6 valence electrons. In the double bond, it shares 4, so it has 6- (4/2)= 6-2 =4 electrons? Wait, no. Each bond contributes two electrons to the atom.

Wait, no. For the Lewis structure, each atom's valence is calculated as: valence electrons minus nonbonding electrons minus bonding electrons.

Wait, maybe I should proceed step by step.

Each Cl has 7 valence electrons. Each is bonded once. So each Cl contributes one electron to the bond, and the other comes from S. So each Cl has 6 lone electrons (three lone pairs). So each Cl has 3 lone pairs. So for two Cls, that's 2 * 3 * 2 =12 electrons (since each lone pair is two electrons). Wait, no: each lone pair is two electrons, so each Cl has 3 lone pairs, which is 6 electrons per Cl. So two Cls contribute 12 electrons.

O has 6 valence electrons. It's double bonded to S, so it shares 4 electrons (two from itself, two from S). So the O's lone electrons would be 6 - (4/2) =6-2=4 electrons, which is two lone pairs.

So, O has two lone pairs, each Cl has three lone pairs. That's O's 4 electrons (2 lone pairs) + Cl's 12 electrons (3 lone pairs each)= 16 electrons. But the total lone electrons should be 18. Oh wait, so where are the remaining 2 electrons?

Ah, wait, S has valence electrons as well. Let me recount.

S has 6 valence electrons. It forms one double bond (sharing 4 electrons) and two single bonds (sharing 2 each, so 4 total). So bonding electrons for S: 4 (double) + 4 (singles) =8. Since each bond contributes two electrons (from both atoms), the total bonding is 8. So S's electrons used in bonding are 8. So S has 6 - (8/2) =6-4=2 electrons left. So S has one lone pair.

So S has one lone pair, O has two, each Cl has three. So total lone electrons: (1 * 2) + (2 * 2) + (2 * 3 *2) = 2 +4 +12=18. Which matches the 26-8=18.

So the structure is S with a double bond to O, single bonds to two Cls, and one lone pair on S.

Now, to determine the molecular geometry. The central sulfur has three bonding domains (one double bond, two single bonds) and one lone pair. So four electron domains total.

Wait, no. Wait, the VSEPR model says that the number of electron domains (bonding and lone pairs) around the central atom determines the geometry. So for SOCl2, the central S has three bonding regions (the double bond counts as one region) and one lone pair. So four regions in total.

When you have four electron domains, the electron geometry is tetrahedral. But the molecular geometry depends on the number of bonding domains and lone pairs. Here, three bonding and one lone pair.

So the molecular shape is trigonal pyramidal? Wait, no. Wait, trigonal pyramidal is when there are three bonding domains and one lone pair in a tetrahedral electron geometry. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, trigonal pyramidal is a molecular geometry with three bonding and one lone pair. But wait, the formula is AX3, but in this case, the central atom has four regions. Oh wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, another approach. The number of electron domains is four (three bonding, one lone). The arrangement of these four would be tetrahedral. So the electron geometry is tetrahedral.

But the molecular geometry, which is the shape based on the atoms only, would be based on the arrangement of atoms. In this case, three atoms (O, Cl, Cl) and one lone pair. So the shape is trigonal pyramidal.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, I think I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. In VSEPR, when there are four electron regions (like AX3 with one lone pair), the molecular geometry is trigonal pyramidal. For example, NH3 has a trigonal pyramidal shape because the central N has three bonding pairs and one lone pair.

So yes, SOCl2 would have a trigonal pyramidal geometry. So the answer would be option C: trigonal pyramidal.

Alternatively, let me think about another molecule. SOCl2 is similar to something like PCl3, but wait, PCl3 has three bonding and one lone pair, so trigonal pyramidal. But wait, no: PCl3 has a trigonal pyramidal geometry because it's AX3 with one lone pair.

Wait, in SOCl2, the central S has three bonding regions and one lone pair. So that's four regions in total. So the VSEPR model would predict that the electron domains arrange themselves tetrahedrally, and with three bonding and one lone pair, the molecular geometry is trigonal pyramidal.

Wait, but another thought: some sources might consider the double bond as taking up more space. But in VSEPR, multiple bonds are treated the same as single bonds for determining geometry because the electron domain is what matters, not the bond order.

So yes, trigonal pyramidal is the correct shape. So the answer should be C.
</think>

The molecular geometry of thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is determined using VSEPR theory. The central sulfur atom has three bonding domains: one double bond with oxygen and two single bonds with chlorine atoms. Additionally, sulfur has one lone pair of electrons. This gives a total of four electron domains around the central atom.

According to VSEPR theory, the electron geometry of four domains is tetrahedral. However, the molecular geometry, which considers only the arrangement of atoms, is influenced by the presence of the lone pair. With three bonding domains and one lone pair, the molecular geometry is best described as **trigonal pyramidal**.

This is consistent with the structure of SOCl₂, where the lone pair on sulfur causes a distortion from the ideal tetrahedral electron geometry, resulting in a trigonal pyramidal molecular shape.
