Answer:
    <think>

Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the conditional expectation of Y given X. The joint density function f(x, y) is given as x + y for 0 < x < 1 and 0 < y < 1, and zero otherwise. Hmm, I remember that conditional expectation involves finding the expected value of Y given a specific X value, which means I'll need the conditional distribution of Y|X.

First step, I think, is to find the marginal distribution of X. The marginal density f_X(x) is obtained by integrating the joint density over all possible y values. So for a given x, y goes from 0 to 1. So, f_X(x) = ∫ f(x,y) dy from y=0 to y=1.

Let me compute that integral. f_X(x) = ∫ (x + y) dy from 0 to 1. Breaking that into two parts: ∫x dy is x*y evaluated from 0 to 1, which gives x*1 - x*0 = x. Then ∫y dy from 0 to1 is (1/2)y² evaluated from 0 to1, which is 1/2. So f_X(x) = x + 1/2.

Wait, but wait. The joint density is given for 0 < x <1 and 0 < y <1, so that's correct. So f_X(x) = x + 1/2 for 0<x<1.

Now, the conditional density f_{Y|X}(y|x) is the joint density divided by the marginal density of X. So that's (x + y) / (x + 1/2).

Now, to find the conditional expectation E[Y|X=x], I need to integrate y * f_{Y|X}(y|x) dy from y=0 to y=1.

So E[Y|X=x] = ∫ y * (x + y) / (x + 1/2) dy from 0 to 1.

Let me factor out the denominator since it's a constant with respect to y. So this becomes 1/(x + 1/2) * ∫ y(x + y) dy.

Expanding the numerator: y(x + y) = xy + y².

So the integral becomes ∫ (xy + y²) dy from 0 to1.

Compute each term:

∫xy dy = x ∫ y dy = x*(1/2 y²) from 0 to1 = x*(1/2)(1) = x/2.

∫y² dy = (1/3 y³) from 0 to1 = 1/3.

So the integral is x/2 + 1/3.

Putting it all together, E[Y|X=x] = (x/2 + 1/3) / (x + 1/2).

Let me simplify that expression. Let's find a common denominator for the numerator terms. The numerator is (3x + 2)/6. Wait, wait: x/2 is 3x/6 and 1/3 is 2/6, so adding them gives (3x + 2)/6.

Denominator is (x + 1/2) = (2x +1)/2.

So the expectation becomes ( (3x +2)/6 ) / ( (2x +1)/2 ) )

Dividing fractions: multiply numerator by reciprocal of denominator.

So (3x+2)/6 * 2/(2x+1) ) = (3x +2)*2 / (6*(2x +1)) )

Simplify numerator and denominator: 2 and 6 can be reduced. 2/6 is 1/3.

So (3x+2) * 1/(3*(2x +1)) ).

Which is (3x +2) / (3*(2x +1)) ).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simplification. Let me check again.

Wait, let's write it as:

E[Y|X=x] = ( (x/2 + 1/3) ) / (x + 1/2 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x/2 + 1/3 = (3x + 2)/6.

Denominator: x + 1/2 = (2x +1)/2.

So E = (3x +2)/6 divided by (2x +1)/2.

Which is (3x +2)/6 * 2/(2x +1) ) = (3x +2) * 2 / [6*(2x +1) ) ] = (6x +4) / (6*(2x+1)).

Simplify numerator and denominator by 2: (3x +2)/(3*(2x +1)).

So E[Y|X] = (3x +2) / (3*(2x +1)).

Wait, perhaps I can factor out 1/3. So it's (3x +2)/(3*(2x +1)) ) = (3x +2)/(6x +3).

Alternatively, maybe I can write it as (3x +2)/(3(2x +1)).

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option G: (3x +2)/(3(2x +1)).

Yes, that's exactly the expression I have here. So the correct answer should be option G.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.

Wait, when I integrated y*(x + y), I got x/2 + 1/3. Then divided by (x +1/2). So:

(x/2 + 1/3) / (x + 1/2) = ( (3x + 2)/6 ) / ( (2x +1)/2 ).

Which is (3x + 2)/6 * 2/(2x +1) ) = (3x +2)(2)/(6(2x +1)) ) = (6x +4)/(6(2x+1)).

Wait, that's (6x +4)/(12x +6). Simplify numerator and denominator by 2: (3x +2)/(6x +3).

Which is the same as (3x +2)/(3(2x +1)).

Yes, correct.

Looking at the options, option G is (3x +2)/[3(2x+1)], which matches.

Alternatively, let me look at all options to confirm:

Option G: (3x +2)/[3(2x +1)].

Yes, that's what I got. So the answer is G.

To compute the conditional expectation of \( Y \) given \( X \), we start with the joint density function \( f(x, y) = x + y \) for \( 0 < x < 1 \) and \( 0 < y < 1 \), and zero otherwise. The conditional expectation \( E[Y|X=x] \) is determined as follows:

1. **Find the marginal density of \( X \):**  
   The marginal density \( f_X(x) \) is obtained by integrating the joint density over \( y \):  
   \[
   f_X(x) = \int_0^1 f(x, y) \, dy = \int_0^1 (x + y) \, dy.
   \]  
   Breaking this into two terms:  
   \[
   \int_0^1 x \, dy = x \quad \text{and} \quad \int_0^1 y \, dy = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]  
   Thus,  
   \[
   f_X(x) = x + \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{for} \quad 0 < x < 1.
   \]

2. **Find the conditional density of \( Y \) given \( X = x \):**  
   The conditional density \( f_{Y|X}(y|x) \) is given by:  
   \[
   f_{Y|X}(y|x) = \frac{f(x, y)}{f_X(x)} = \frac{x + y}{x + \frac{1}{2}}.
   \]

3. **Compute the conditional expectation \( E[Y|X=x] \):**  
   The conditional expectation is given by:  
   \[
   E[Y|X=x] = \int_0^1 y \cdot f_{Y|X}(y|x) \, dy = \int_0^1 y \cdot \frac{x + y}{x + \frac{1}{2}} \, dy.
   \]  
   Factoring out the constant denominator \( x + \frac{1}{2} \):  
   \[
   E[Y|X=x] = \frac{1}{x + \frac{1}{2}} \int_0^1 y(x + y) \, dy.
   \]  
   Expanding the numerator:  
   \[
   \int_0^1 y(x + y) \, dy = \int_0^1 xy \, dy + \int_0^1 y^2 \, dy.
   \]  
   Computing each term:  
   \[
   \int_0^1 xy \, dy = x \int_0^1 y \, dy = x \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{2},
   \]  
   \[
   \int_0^1 y^2 \, dy = \frac{1}{3}.
   \]  
   Thus,  
   \[
   \int_0^1 y(x + y) \, dy = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{1}{3}.
   \]  
   Substituting back:  
   \[
   E[Y|X=x] = \frac{\frac{x}{2} + \frac{1}{3}}{x + \frac{1}{2}}.
   \]

4. **Simplify the expression:**  
   The numerator \( \frac{x}{2} + \frac{1}{3} \) can be written as \( \frac{3x + 2}{6} \), and the denominator \( x + \frac{1}{2} \) can be written as \( \frac{2x + 1}{2} \). Thus:  
   \[
   E[Y|X=x] = \frac{\frac{3x + 2}{6}}{\frac{2x + 1}{2}} = \frac{3x + 2}{6} \cdot \frac{2}{2x + 1} = \frac{3x + 2}{3(2x + 1)}.
   \]

5. **Match with the options:**  
   Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option G**:  
   \[
   E[Y|X=x] = \frac{3x + 2}{3(2x + 1)}.
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**G**
