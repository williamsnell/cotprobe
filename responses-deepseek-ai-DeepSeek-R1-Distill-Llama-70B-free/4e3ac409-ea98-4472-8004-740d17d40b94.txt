Alright, so I have this question about depreciation using the declining-balance method. Hmm, I remember that declining-balance is a method where each year's depreciation is calculated as a percentage of the current book value of the asset. The key point is that you don't depreciate the asset down to zero; you stop when the remaining balance equals the salvage value.

The question says Dr. Frankel bought an X-ray machine for $4,000. It has a 5-year life and a salvage value of $800. He's using a 40% depreciation rate. I need to compute the depreciation for each year and pick the correct option from A to J.

Okay, so the formula for depreciation each year is (book value) multiplied by the depreciation rate. And each year, the book value decreases by the depreciation taken that year. But wait, I think there's a point where you switch methods because the declining-balance might cause the depreciation to drop below the straight-line method in the later years. Or is that only when using a different convention?

Wait, no, the declining-balance method doesn't switch automatically. Some companies use a hybrid where they switch to straight-line in the last year to match the salvage value. Oh, but that's not mentioned here. So I guess we just apply 40% each year until the remaining value is the salvage.

Wait, let's think. The asset is $4k, salvage is $800. So the total depreciable amount is $4k - $800 = $3,200. But we're using 40%, so let's compute each year.

Year 1: 40% of $4000 = $1,600. So book value becomes $4000 - $1600 = $2,400.

Year 2: 40% of $2,400 is $960. Book value now $1,440.

Year 3: 40% of $1,440 = $576. Book value $864.

Year 4: 40% of 864 is $345.6. But wait, if I subtract that, the remaining would be $864 - $345.6 = $518.4. Oh but the salvage is $800. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because 518 is way below 800. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, maybe after a certain point, the depreciation is adjusted so that the remaining value doesn't go below the salvage. So each year, you calculate as usual, but when the next year's depreciation would take it below salvage, you adjust that year's depreciation to only bring it down to the salvage.

Wait, but the way declining balance works, it's typically applied each year without considering whether it's approaching the salvage value until the end. Or do we have to make sure that the book value at the end of the period doesn't go below the salvage.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The standard method, I think, is that you keep applying the rate each year, but you don't take the depreciation below the salvage value.

So for each year, calculate depreciation as 40% of current book value. Then subtract that from the current book value to get the next year's book value.

But after year 3, the book value was $864. Then year 4, 40% of 864 is 345.6. Subtracting that would leave 864 - 345.6 = 518.4, which is way below the 800 salvage. So that can't be right. Oh wait, wait. Maybe the declining balance method stops when the book value equals the salvage value. But how?

Wait, perhaps the way it works is that you don't take depreciation beyond the point where the book value would be less than the salvage. So in the last year, or whenever that happens, you adjust the depreciation to bring it exactly to the salvage value.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is that each year's depreciation is 40% of the current book value, but you stop depreciating once the book value reaches the salvage value.

Let me try computing each year step by step.

Year 1:
Depreciation = 4000 * 0.4 = 1600. Book value = 4000 - 1600 = 2400.

Year 2:
Depreciation = 2400 * 0.4 = 960. Book value = 2400 - 960 = 1440.

Year 3:
Depreciation = 1440 *0.4 = 576. Book value = 1440 - 576 = 864.

Year 4:
Depreciation = 864 *0.4 = 345.6. Now, if we subtract that, the book value would be 864 - 345.6 = 518.4. But the salvage is 800, which is higher than 518.4. So this can't be correct. So perhaps that's not how it's done.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something about the salvage value. The salvage value is the estimated value at the end of the asset's life. So perhaps the total depreciation over 5 years should be 4000 - 800 = 3200.

So the total depreciation is $3,200 over 5 years. Using the declining balance method, which can sometimes result in higher depreciation in the early years and lower in the later.

Wait, but in declining balance, the rate is applied to the current book value each year, not considering the remaining years. So perhaps we proceed as follows.

Year 1: 1600, book 2400.

Year 2: 960, book 1440.

Year 3: 576, book 864.

Year 4: 345.6, book 518.4.

Wait, but the salvage is 800, so this can't be right. So how does that work?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that we can't let the book value go below the salvage. So in the last year, we adjust the depreciation to make sure that the book value doesn't go below the salvage.

Wait, but the asset's life is 5 years, so perhaps we compute for all five years, and the last year's depreciation is whatever it takes to bring the book value down to the salvage.

Let's try this approach:

After year 4, the book value is 864.

In year 5, the depreciation should be 864 *40% = 345.6, which would leave 864 - 345.6 = 518.4, which is less than 800. So that's not acceptable.

So instead, in year 5, the depreciation should be 864 - 800 = 64. So that the book value becomes 800.

Wait, but that would mean that in year 4, you don't take 40% of 864 (345.6), but instead take less. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the depreciation up until the point where the next depreciation would exceed the remaining value. So let's see:

We have to compute for five years, but perhaps in the last year, you take a smaller depreciation to reach the salvage value.

So let's try:

Year 1: 1600 (4000 *0.4), book 2400.

Year 2: 960 (2400 *0.4), book 1440.

Year 3: 576 (1440 *0.4), book 864.

Year 4: 40% of 864 is 345.6. But if we take that, book value becomes 864 - 345.6 = 518.4, which is below 800. So instead, we can't take 345.6. So in year 4, we take (864 - 800) = 64 as depreciation? Wait, that would make the book value 800, which is the salvage. But then, what about year 5? There’s no more depreciation because the book value is already at salvage.

So, that would mean that year 4 depreciation is 64, and year 5's depreciation is 0.

So the five years would be:

Year 1: 1600

Year 2: 960

Year 3: 576

Year 4: 64

Year 5: 0

Looking at the options, option D is: 1,600, 960, 576, 64, 0.

Wait, that's exactly what we have here. So that would make option D correct.

Wait a minute, but another way to think is that perhaps the last year, which is year 5, the depreciation is the remaining amount to reach the salvage.

So let me recast it.

After Year 3, book value is 864.

Year 4: depreciation is 40% of 864 = 345.6. But 864 -345.6 = 518.4, which is less than 800, so that's a problem. So perhaps in year 4, we take a depreciation that brings the book value to 800.

So 864 - depreciation = 800. So depreciation = 64.

Then, year 4: 64. Year 5: 0.

So the depreciation over five years would be 1600, 960, 576, 64, 0. Which matches option D.

Alternatively, some sources say that when using declining balance, you don't adjust until the asset's book value reaches the salvage value. But in that case, because the asset's life is 5 years, perhaps in the fifth year, you'd adjust the depreciation to reach the salvage.

Wait, another approach: compute the depreciation for each year, and if the next year's depreciation would bring the book value below salvage, then adjust the final depreciation to make the book value equal to the salvage.

So let's compute each year:

Year 1: 40% of 4000 = 1600 → BV 2400.

Year 2: 40% of 2400 = 960 → BV 1440.

Year 3: 40% of 1440 = 576 → BV 864.

Year 4: 40% of 864 = 345.6 → but 864 - 345.6 = 518.4 < 800. So we can't take that. So instead, in year 4, depreciation would be 864 - 800 = 64. Thus, BV after year 4 is 800.

Year 5: no depreciation because BV is 800, which is salvage. So depreciation is zero.

Thus, the depreciation each year is 1600, 960, 576, 64, 0.

Looking at the options, option D is exactly that.

So the correct answer would be option D.
</think>

To compute the depreciation for each year using the declining-balance method, we start with the initial cost of the X-ray machine ($4,000) and apply a 40% depreciation rate annually. The salvage value at the end of the asset's 5-year life is $800. Under the declining-balance method, depreciation is calculated as a percentage of the current book value, and the depreciation stops when the book value equals the salvage value.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Year 1**:  
   Depreciation = $4,000 * 40% = $1,600.  
   Book Value = $4,000 - $1,600 = $2,400.  

2. **Year 2**:  
   Depreciation = $2,400 * 40% = $960.  
   Book Value = $2,400 - $960 = $1,440.  

3. **Year 3**:  
   Depreciation = $1,440 * 40% = $576.  
   Book Value = $1,440 - $576 = $864.  

4. **Year 4**:  
   Depreciation = $864 * 40% = $345.6.  
   Subtracting this would result in a book value of $864 - $345.6 = $518.4, which is below the salvage value of $800. Therefore, the depreciation in Year 4 is adjusted to bring the book value down to the salvage value:  
   Depreciation = $864 - $800 = $64.  
   Book Value = $800.  

5. **Year 5**:  
   Since the book value is already equal to the salvage value ($800), no further depreciation is taken.  
   Depreciation = $0.  

### Depreciation Schedule:
- Year 1: $1,600  
- Year 2: $960  
- Year 3: $576  
- Year 4: $64  
- Year 5: $0  

### Correct Option:
The depreciation schedule matches **Option D**: $1,600, $960, $576, $64, $0.
