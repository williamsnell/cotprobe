Okay, so I've got this problem here about a loan, and I'm trying to figure out how much cash I can get now on a $4,000 loan that's repayable in three years with interest compounded at half a percent per month. Hmm, let me think this through.

First, I remember that when dealing with loans, especially when calculating present value, the concept of present value of a future amount comes into play. Because the money is received now but repaid later with interest. So the key here is to find the present value of that $4,000 that I'll have to repay in three years.

The interest is compounded monthly, right? So the formula for compound interest would be A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount, which is $4,000 here.
- r is the annual interest rate, but wait, in this case, the rate is given per month, so I think that's already the periodic rate. Oh wait, no, wait. Because it's compounded monthly, the monthly rate is 0.5%, so that's the periodic rate. So the formula for the present value would rearrange this.

Wait, no, the present value formula is P = A / (1 + r)^n, but since it's compounded monthly, I think I need to adjust the formula. Oh right, the present value of a single sum is given by PV = FV / (1 + i)^n, where i is the periodic interest rate and n is the total number of periods.

So let me get this straight: the loan amount is $4,000, which is the future value (FV). I need to find the present value (PV) of that amount. The interest rate per period (month) is 0.5%, so i = 0.005. The loan is for three years, so n would be 3 years multiplied by 12 months per year, which is 36 months.

So plugging into the formula: PV = 4000 / (1 + 0.005)^36.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. The loan is repayable in three years, so that's the time factor. The interest is compounded monthly at 0.5% per month. So each month, the interest is 0.5% of the outstanding amount.

So the calculation is: 4000 divided by (1.005) raised to the 36th power.

Now, I need to compute (1.005)^36. Let me think about how to calculate that. I don't have a calculator here, but I can approximate it. Alternatively, I remember that the formula for compound interest can be calculated step by step, but maybe I can find a way to compute 1.005^36.

Wait, another way: using the rule of 72 or something? No, that's for doubling time. Maybe it's easier to compute it using logarithms or exponentials, but perhaps I can remember that (1.005)^36 is approximately e^(0.005*36) because for small r, ln(1+r) ≈ r. So 0.005 *36 is 0.18, so e^0.18 is about 1.1972. So (1.005)^36 ≈ 1.1972.

Wait, but I think that approximation might not be very accurate. Let me see, another way: perhaps compute it step by step. Let's see, 1.005^12 is about 1.061678 (since 0.5% per month for a year gives about 6.1678% annual rate). So for three years, that would be 1.061678^3. Let's compute that.

1.061678 squared is approximately (1.061678 * 1.061678). Let's do that:

1.06 * 1.06 is 1.1236, but considering the exact value:

1.061678 * 1.061678:

Multiply 1.061678 by 1.061678:

= (1 + 0.061678)^2 = 1 + 2*0.061678 + (0.061678)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.123356 + 0.003803 ≈ 1.127159.

Wait, but that's for two years. Then for three years, multiply by another 1.061678.

So 1.127159 * 1.061678. Let's approximate:

1.127 * 1.06 is approximately 1.127 + (1.127 * 0.06). 1.127 * 0.06 is about 0.06762, so total around 1.19462. Adding more precisely: 1.127159 * 1.061678.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the formula (1.005)^36. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just compute 1.005^36.

Let me try to compute it step by step:

1.005^1 = 1.005
1.005^2 = 1.005 * 1.005 = 1.010025
1.005^3 ≈ 1.010025 * 1.005 = 1.0150751
1.005^4 ≈ 1.0150751 * 1.005 ≈ 1.0201505
Continuing this way up to 36 would take too long, but perhaps I can find a pattern or use logarithms.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for compound interest. So, using the exponent approach:

ln(1.005) = approximately 0.004975 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x^2/2 + x^3/3..., for small x). So 0.005.

So ln(1.005) ≈ 0.004975.

Thus, ln(PV) = ln(4000) - 36 * ln(1.005).

Compute 36 * 0.004975 = 0.1791.

So ln(PV) = ln(4000) - 0.1791.

What's ln(4000)? Let's see: ln(4000) is ln(4*10^3) = ln(4) + 3 ln(10). ln(4) is about 1.386, ln(10) is about 2.3026. So 1.386 + 3*2.3026 = 1.386 + 6.9078 = 8.2938.

So ln(PV) = 8.2938 - 0.1791 = 8.1147.

Now, e^8.1147 is the value we need. Let's compute e^8.1147.

Wait, but e^8 is about 2980.911. Because e^7 is about 1096, e^8 is e^7 * e, which is 1096 * 2.718 ≈ 2980.

But wait, 8.1147 is 8 + 0.1147.

So e^8.1147 = e^8 * e^0.1147.

e^0.1147 is approximately 1.1212 (since ln(1.12) ≈ 0.1133, so e^0.1133=1.12, so 0.1147 would be about 1.121).

So e^8.1147 ≈ 2980.911 * 1.121 ≈ 2980 * 1.12 is 3340, but let's compute it more accurately.

2980.911 * 1.121 = ?

2980.911 * 1 = 2980.911
2980.911 * 0.12 = 357.70932
2980.911 * 0.001 = 2.980911
Adding them up: 2980.911 + 357.70932 = 3338.6203 + 2.980911 ≈ 3341.601.

Wait, but this is the future value. Wait no, wait. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, earlier steps: I think I made a mistake. Because the initial formula was PV = 4000 / (1.005)^36. So when I took the natural log, I had ln(PV) = ln(4000) - 36*ln(1.005) = 8.2938 - 0.1791 = 8.1147. So e^8.1147 gives me the present value. Wait, no, wait: PV = 4000 / (1.005)^36. So taking ln on both sides: ln(PV) = ln(4000) - 36 * ln(1.005). So that's correct.

So e^8.1147 is approximately 3341.6. But that's not possible because the present value should be less than 4000. Wait, maybe I messed up the steps.

Wait, no. Wait, no, because 1.005^36 is approximately e^(0.18) ≈ 1.197, as I thought earlier. So 4000 / 1.197 ≈ 3342. So the present value is about 3342, which would be around option J, which is $3,342.59.

Wait, that makes sense. So the correct answer would be J: $3,342.59.

Let me double-check. Because sometimes when dealing with present value, if the interest is monthly, the formula adjusts for the number of periods correctly. So yes, 3 years is 36 months, each at 0.5% interest.

So using the present value formula: PV = FV / (1 + i)^n.

FV is 4000, i is 0.005, n is 36.

So 1.005^36 = (1.005)^36. Let me compute this more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using the formula for compound interest.

Alternatively, using the rule that (1.005)^12 ≈ 1.061678, as I mentioned earlier. So for three years, it's (1.061678)^3.

Compute 1.061678^3:

First, 1.061678 squared: 1.061678 * 1.061678 = let me compute that.

1.061678 * 1.061678:

= 1.1271 (approximately, as done before).

Now, 1.1271 * 1.061678 ≈

Let me compute 1.1271 * 1.061678.

Breaking it down:

1.1271 * 1 = 1.1271

1.1271 * 0.06 = 0.067626

1.1271 * 0.001678 ≈ approximately 0.0019 (since 1.1271 * 0.001 is 0.0011271, and 0.000678*1.1271≈ ~0.000763)

Adding them up: 1.1271 + 0.067626 = 1.194726 + 0.000763 ≈ 1.195489.

So (1.005)^36 ≈ 1.1955.

So PV = 4000 / 1.1955 ≈ let's compute that.

4000 divided by 1.1955.

Let me see: 1.1955 * 3342 = ?

Wait, 4000 / 1.1955 ≈ ?

Compute 4000 ÷ 1.1955.

Let me see: 1.1955 times 3342.

Alternatively, 1.1955 times 3342 equals approximately 4000.

Because 3342 * 1.005 each month for 36 months would give 4000.

So 4000 / 1.1955 ≈ 3342.

Therefore, the present value is approximately $3,342.59, which is option J.
</think>

To determine how much cash can be obtained now on a $4,000 loan repayable in three years with interest compounded at 0.5% per month, we use the present value formula:

\[
PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + i)^n}
\]

Where:
- \( FV = 4000 \) (the future value of the loan),
- \( i = 0.005 \) (the monthly interest rate),
- \( n = 36 \) (the total number of months in three years).

First, calculate \( (1 + 0.005)^{36} \). Using approximations and iterative calculations:

1. \( (1.005)^{12} \approx 1.061678 \) (the annual factor for monthly compounding),
2. \( (1.061678)^3 \approx 1.1955 \) (the factor for three years).

Now, substitute into the formula:

\[
PV = \frac{4000}{1.1955} \approx 3342.59
\]

Thus, the present value of the loan is approximately **$3,342.59**, which corresponds to option **J**.
