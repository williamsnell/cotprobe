B: Maltose
C: Sucrose
D: Fructose
E: Glycogen
F: polysaccharides
G: Galactose
H: Lactose
I: glucose
J: Alpha limit dextrins

Okay, so I've got this question about oral bacteria and what they use from the host's diet to make glucans. Hmm, I remember from my bio class that glucans are these big sugar molecules, right? Like dextran and mutan.

Wait, the question is asking which dietary component the bacteria use to synthesize these extracellular glucans. The options are A to J, with things like starch, maltose, sucrose, fructose, etc.

I think that sucrose is a key player here. Because I remember something about bacteria using sucrose to produce these glucans. Oh right, sucrose is a disaccharide made of glucose and fructose. Oral bacteria like Streptococcus mutans can break down sucrose. They have enzymes called glucosyltransferases, which use the glucose part of sucrose to build these glucans, which are like a sticky matrix helping the bacteria adhere to teeth, leading to plaque and cavities.

So looking at the options, option C is sucrose. That must be the correct answer. Other options like glucose (I) might be a product, but the starting point is sucrose. Starch (A) is a polysaccharide, but I think humans don't digest it completely, but the main source for the bacteria is probably sucrose. Maltose (B) is another sugar, but I don't think it's as directly involved as sucrose.

Wait, what about option F, polysaccharides? No, because glucans are produced from the breakdown of a specific sugar, not directly from polysaccharides. The bacteria take the sucrose and convert it into these longer chains.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident it's C: Sucrose.

The oral bacteria synthesize extracellular glucans, such as dextran and mutan, using sucrose from the host's diet. Sucrose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose, is broken down by bacterial enzymes like glucosyltransferases, which utilize the glucose moiety to produce these glucans. These molecules help bacteria adhere to teeth, contributing to plaque formation and tooth decay. Among the options, sucrose is the most directly involved in this process.
