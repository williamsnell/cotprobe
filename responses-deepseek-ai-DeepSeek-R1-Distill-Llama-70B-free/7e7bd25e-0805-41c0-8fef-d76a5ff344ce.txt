Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. 

The question is about a swimmer diving from a 3-meter high platform. The swimmer's mass is 60 kg. We need to find the acceleration of the Earth as the swimmer falls toward the water. The Earth's mass is given as approximately 6 × 10^24 kg. The options are A through J.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that when two objects interact through gravity, both accelerate towards each other. But usually, the Earth's acceleration is so tiny that we don't notice it. I think Newton's law of gravitation is involved here.

Newton's law of gravitation says that the force between two masses is F = G*(m1*m2)/r². G is the gravitational constant, about 6.67 × 10^-11 N·m²/kg². But wait, when the swimmer jumps, the distance r is the distance from the swimmer to the Earth's center. But since the platform is only 3 meters high, maybe we can approximate r as just the Earth's radius, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the exact value of r isn't needed here because the question is about the acceleration, not the force.

Oh, right! Because F = m * a, so for the Earth's acceleration, a_earth = F / M_earth. Similarly, for the swimmer, a_swimmer = F / m_swimmer. But since F is the same in both cases (because the force is mutual), the accelerations are inversely proportional to their masses.

Wait, but the swimmer is diving, so from the Earth's frame, the swimmer is accelerating downward at about 9.8 m/s². But that's the acceleration experienced by the swimmer. The Earth's acceleration would be much smaller.

So, let's think about the mutual forces. The gravitational force on the swimmer is F = m_swimmer * g, where g is about 9.8 m/s². So F = 60 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 588 N. But that's the force on the swimmer. The force on the Earth is the same in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Then, the Earth's acceleration a_earth is F / M_earth. So F is 588 N, M_earth is 6e24 kg. So a_earth = 588 / 6e24.

Let me calculate that. 588 divided by 6e24. Let's see, 588 /6 is 98. So 98 / 1e24 = 9.8e-23 m/s². Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

The options are A to J. Option J is 9.8e-23 m/s². That matches what I just got. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me make sure I did this right. Another approach is to use the formula for acceleration of the Earth. The Earth's acceleration a = (G * m_swimmer) / (r²) ?

Wait, no. Because a = F/M, and F is G*(M*m)/r², so a = (G*m)/r². But wait, that's the same as the acceleration of the swimmer, which is g. Because for the swimmer, a_swimmer = G*M_earth / r² = g.

So, the Earth's acceleration would be a_earth = G*m_swimmer / r² = (m_swimmer / M_earth) * a_swimmer.

Since a_swimmer is g, approximately 9.8 m/s². So a_earth = (60 kg / 6e24 kg) * 9.8.

Wait, 60 / 6e24 is 1e-23, so 1e-23 *9.8 is 9.8e-23. So yeah, same result as before.

So the acceleration of the Earth is 9.8e-23 m/s², which is option J.

But wait, let me check the options again to make sure. Option J is written as 9.8 × 10^-23 m/s², yes. So that's correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the Earth's acceleration is inversely proportional to its mass. Since the swimmer's mass is 60 kg and Earth's is about 6e24 kg, the ratio is 60/(6e24) = 1e-23. So the Earth's acceleration is g times that ratio, which is 9.8 * 1e-23 = 9.8e-23 m/s².

To determine the acceleration of the Earth as the swimmer falls, we use Newton's law of gravitation and the relationship between force and acceleration. The gravitational force between the swimmer and the Earth is given by:

\[
F = G \cdot \frac{m_{\text{swimmer}} \cdot M_{\text{Earth}}}{r^2}
\]

where \( G \) is the gravitational constant (\( 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \)), \( m_{\text{swimmer}} = 60 \, \text{kg} \), \( M_{\text{Earth}} = 6 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \), and \( r \) is the distance between the swimmer and the Earth's center. However, since the Earth's radius is much larger than the height of the platform (3 m), we can approximate \( r \) as the Earth's radius, and the acceleration of the swimmer is approximately \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \).

The Earth's acceleration is related to the force by:

\[
a_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{F}{M_{\text{Earth}}}
\]

Substituting \( F = m_{\text{swimmer}} \cdot g \), we get:

\[
a_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{m_{\text{swimmer}} \cdot g}{M_{\text{Earth}}}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
a_{\text{Earth}} = \frac{60 \cdot 9.8}{6 \times 10^{24}} = \frac{588}{6 \times 10^{24}} = 9.8 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

Thus, the acceleration of the Earth is \( 9.8 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{m/s}^2 \), which corresponds to option J.
