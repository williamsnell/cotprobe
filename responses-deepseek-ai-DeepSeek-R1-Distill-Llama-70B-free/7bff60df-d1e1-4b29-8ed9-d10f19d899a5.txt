Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Yi Yin sacrificed to the former king, and presented the heir-king reverently before the shrine of his grandfather. . . . Yi Yin then clearly described the virtue of the Meritorious Ancestor for the instruction of the young king.
"Oh! of old the former kings of Xia cultivated earnestly their virtue, and then there were no calamities from Heaven. The spirits of the hills and rivers were all in tranquility; and the birds and beasts enjoyed their existence according to their nature. But their descendant did not follow their example, and Heaven sent down calamities, using our ruler, who possessed of its favor. The attack on Xia may be traced to the orgies in Ming Tiao. . . . Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess; for oppression he substituted his generous gentleness. Now your Majesty is entering on the inheritance of his virtue; all depends on how you commence your reign.
"Oh! the former king began with careful attention to the bonds that hold men together. . . . Revere these warnings in your person. . . . The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings, and on the evil-doer it sends down all miseries. If you not be virtuous, be it in large things or in small, it will bring the ruin of your ancestral temple."

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about a passage from the Shu Jing, which is an ancient Chinese text. The question is asking which phrase can be seen as a statement of the roots of Daoist beliefs. The options are A through D, and I need to figure out which one aligns with Daoist ideas.

First, I need to recall what Daoist beliefs are about. From what I remember, Daoism emphasizes living in harmony with the natural order, or the Dao. It's about things being in their natural state and following their nature without interference. So concepts like "nature" and "existence according to their nature" might be relevant.

Looking at the options:

Option C says, "The birds and beasts... enjoyed their existence according to their nature." That sounds a lot like the Daoist idea of living in harmony with nature, where each creature follows its natural way without being forced or controlled. So this could be a strong candidate.

Option A talks about the king displaying prowess, which seems more related to leadership and virtue, maybe more Confucian than Daoist.

Option B mentions "bonds that hold men together," which again sounds like social structures or relationships, which is more in line with Confucianism, which focuses on social harmony and proper relationships.

Option D discusses Heaven rewarding the good and punishing the evil. That's a more moralistic view, which I think is more aligned with other philosophies, maybe even the earlier parts of the Shu Jing, which are about divine mandate and moral behavior. Daoism isn't as focused on Heaven rewarding or punishing but more on natural order.

So putting it all together, the phrase in option C about birds and beasts enjoying existence according to their nature seems to reflect the Daoist principle of living in accordance with one's natural state.

The phrase that aligns with Daoist beliefs is option C, as it reflects the idea of living in harmony with nature, a central tenet of Daoism.

Answer: C
