Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about conduct disorders and their types. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, the question asks about the four major types of conduct disorders and their main characteristics. The options are A through J, each listing different psychological terms.

I remember that conduct disorder is a broad term, and within it, there are specific disorders classified under it. Let me recall: I think conduct disorders are a category in the DSM-5, which is the manual used for psychiatric diagnoses. They fall under disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders.

Wait, right, some of the specific ones include oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), intermittent explosive disorder (IED), kleptomania, and pyromania. Oh, and maybe others like conduct disorder itself, but I'm not sure if that's separate or part of these.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Phobias, PTSD, OCD, panic disorder. Those are anxiety disorders, not conduct disorders. So A is out.

Option B: ODD, IED, kleptomania, pyromania. These all sound familiar as impulse-control or conduct-related. ODD is definitely a conduct disorder. IED is about explosive outbursts. Kleptomania is the urge to steal, and pyromania is about setting fires. So B looks promising.

Option C: ADHD, conduct disorder, separation anxiety, reactive attachment. ADHD is attention deficit, which is a different category. Separation anxiety is an anxiety disorder, and reactive attachment is its own thing. So C mixes different categories, probably not the answer.

Option D: Depression, anxiety, bipolar, schizophrenia. These are mood disorders and psychoses, unrelated to conduct disorders.

Option E: Somatic, dissociative, conversion, factitious disorders. These are different categories, like somatic symptom and dissociative issues. Not related.

Option F: Personality disorders. While some personality disorders like antisocial are related to conduct issues, the question is about the four types of conduct disorders specifically, not personality disorders. So F is probably not it.

Option G: ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia. These are neurodevelopmental disorders, not conduct disorders.

Option H: Learning, language, motor skills, cognitive. These are different types of disorders, maybe learning disabilities, which are separate.

Option I: Eating, sleep, impulse-control, neurocognitive. Eating and sleep are separate categories. Impulse-control might overlap, but the other terms don't fit as the main four.

Option J: Antisocial reactions, dyssocial reactions, addictions, sexual deviations. I'm not too sure about these terms. Antisocial might relate, but the others like addictions are a different category now in DSM-5, under substance-related disorders.

So circling back, the correct answer should be B: oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, kleptomania, and pyromania. These are all classified under conduct or impulse-control disorders. Conduct disorder itself might be another category, but perhaps the question is considering these four as the major types within that group.

The correct answer is B: Oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, kleptomania, and pyromania. These are recognized as specific types of conduct or impulse-control disorders, fitting the question's criteria.
