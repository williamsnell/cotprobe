Okay, so I have this question about why milk spoils when kept in the refrigerator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my food science, but let me think through this.

The question is multiple choice with options A to J. The main point is understanding why milk spoils even when refrigerated. I remember that refrigeration slows down bacterial growth because most bacteria thrive at warmer temperatures. But wait, some bacteria can still grow in the cold, right?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Lactose crystallization. I don't think lactose crystallizes at low temps. Maybe that's more about texture changes, not spoilage.

Option B: Absorption of odors. That's more about the smell, but spoilage is about the milk going bad, not just taking on odors.

Option C: Mesophiles. Those are bacteria that like moderate temps, like room temperature. The fridge is colder, so maybe they don't grow as much.

Option D: Chemical reactions. I'm not sure. Spoilage might involve some chemical changes, but is that the main reason?

Option E: Thermophiles. Those love high heat, like in hot environments. The fridge is cold, so they probably don't cause spoilage there.

Option F: Activation of dormant bacteria. Some bacteria form spores or become dormant. The fridge might slow them down, but I'm not certain if that's the main issue.

Option G: Enzymes in the fridge. I don't think the fridge itself has enzymes that affect milk. Maybe the milk's own enzymes, but I'm not sure that's the cause.

Option H: Separation of fat. That might make the milk look unappealing, but does it spoil? Probably not the main reason for spoilage.

Option I: Psychrophilic bacteria. Oh right, psychrophiles are cold-loving bacteria. They can grow at refrigerator temperatures, which are around 4°C. So even when you refrigerate, these bacteria can multiply and cause spoilage.

Option J: UV light. Most fridges don't have UV light, so that's probably not a factor.

So putting it together, the spoilage is likely due to bacteria that can grow in the cold. Psychrophilic bacteria would be the ones causing it, so the answer should be I.

The spoilage of milk in a refrigerator is primarily due to the activity of psychrophilic bacteria, which are capable of growing at low temperatures, including those typically found in refrigerators. These bacteria thrive in cooler environments and can multiply even when the milk is stored at around 4°C, leading to spoilage. This makes option I the correct answer.

Answer: I
