Okay, so I've got this problem about the dye dilution method to measure cardiac output. Hmm, I remember that cardiac output is the volume of blood the heart pumps per minute, right? And the dye dilution method involves injecting a known amount of dye into the bloodstream and then measuring the concentration over time.

The problem gives me the concentration of the dye as a function of time, c(t) = 20 t e^(-0.6 t), where t is in seconds, and the time range is from 0 to 10 seconds. Oh, and the dye used is 6 mg. So I need to find the cardiac output.

Wait, how does the dye dilution method work again? I think the idea is that the total amount of dye injected is equal to the integral of the concentration over time, multiplied by the cardiac output. Oh right, because the concentration is measured in mg/L, and the cardiac output is in liters per minute. So the formula should be something like the integral of c(t) dt from 0 to the time it takes for the dye to recirculate, which in this model seems to be 10 seconds.

Wait, no, the formula is Cardiac Output (CO) = amount of dye / integral of c(t) dt. Because the theory is that the dye is diluted in the blood, and the area under the concentration-time curve (which is the integral) is inversely proportional to the flow rate (CO). So yeah, CO = D / ∫c(t) dt, where D is the total dye.

So D is given as 6 mg. But wait, I need to make sure the units match. The integral will be in (mg/L) * seconds, and CO is in L/min. So I'll have to convert the integral's time unit from seconds to minutes, right?

Let me write this down. The integral of c(t) from t=0 to t=10. c(t) is 20 t e^(-0.6 t). So the integral ∫ 20 t e^(-0.6 t) dt from 0 to 10.

Wait, let me compute that integral. It's an exponential function multiplied by t. So integration by parts. Let me recall, ∫ t e^(-kt) dt. Let me set u = t, dv = e^(-kt) dt. Then du = dt, and v = (-1/k) e^(-kt).

So integration by parts gives uv - ∫ v du = (-t/(k)) e^(-kt) + (1/k) ∫ e^(-kt) dt.

Which is (-t/(k)) e^(-kt) + (1/k^2) e^(-kt) evaluated from 0 to 10.

In this case, k is 0.6. So the integral becomes [ (-t/0.6) e^(-0.6 t) + (1/(0.6)^2) e^(-0.6 t) ) ] from 0 to 10.

Let's compute this at t=10 and t=0.

At t=10: [ (-10/0.6) e^(-6) + (1/(0.36)) e^(-6) ) ].

Wait, 0.6 *10 is 6, so exponent is e^(-6). Let's compute each term:

First term: (-10 / 0.6) = -16.666... so -16.666 e^(-6).

Second term: 1/(0.36) is approximately 2.7777... so 2.7777 e^(-6).

So together, at t=10: (-16.666 + 2.7777) e^(-6) = (-13.8883) e^(-6).

At t=0: [ (-0/0.6) e^(0) + (1/0.36) e^(0) ) ].

Which is 0 + (1/0.36)*1 = approximately 2.7777.

So the integral from 0 to 10 is [ (-13.8883 e^(-6) ) ] - [ 2.7777 ].

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-calculate:

Wait, the integral from 0 to10 is [ upper limit ] - [ lower limit ].

So at upper limit (t=10): (-10/0.6)e^{-6} + (1/0.36) e^{-6}.

At lower limit (t=0): 0 + (1/0.36) * 1.

So the integral is:

[ (-10/0.6 + 1/0.36 ) e^{-6} ] - (1/0.36).

Let me compute (-10/0.6) which is -16.6667, and 1/0.36 is about 2.7778.

So (-16.6667 + 2.7778) = -13.8889.

So that part is -13.8889 e^{-6}.

Then subtract 1/0.36, which is about 2.7778.

So the integral is [ (-13.8889 e^{-6}) - 2.7778 ].

Wait, wait a second, no. Let me re-express it.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate it more accurately.

The integral is:

At t=10: [ (-10/0.6) e^{-6} + (1/(0.6)^2) e^{-6} ].

Which is [ (-16.6666667) e^{-6} + (2.7777778) e^{-6} ].

So that's [ (-16.6666667 + 2.7777778) ] e^{-6 }.

Which is (-13.8888889) e^{-6}.

At t=0, it's [ 0 + (1/(0.6)^2) e^0 ] = 2.7777778 * 1.

So the integral from 0 to 10 is:

[ (-13.8888889 e^{-6}) ] - [ 2.7777778 ].

Wait, no, because when you evaluate the definite integral, it's [ value at 10 ] minus [ value at 0 ].

So the integral is [ (-13.8888889 e^{-6}) ] - [ 2.7777778 ].

So that's -13.8888889 e^{-6} - 2.7777778.

Wait, but that would give a negative value, which doesn't make sense for concentration over time. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me double-check the integration by parts.

The integral of 20 t e^{-0.6 t} dt from 0 to10.

Wait, I think I forgot to multiply the 20 in my initial calculation. Oh right, the c(t) is 20 t e^{-0.6 t}, so the integral is 20 multiplied by the integral I just computed.

So that's an important point. So the integral of c(t) dt is 20 times [ (-13.8888889 e^{-6}) - 2.7777778 ].

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

Wait, the integral of c(t) dt is 20 * ∫ t e^{-0.6 t} dt.

So let me compute ∫ t e^{-0.6 t} dt from 0 to10.

Which, as per integration by parts:

= [ (-t/(0.6)) e^{-0.6 t} + (1/(0.6)^2) e^{-0.6 t} ] from 0 to 10.

At t=10:

= (-10/0.6) e^{-6} + (1/(0.36)) e^{-6}.

= (-16.6666667) e^{-6} + (2.7777778) e^{-6}.

= (-13.8888889) e^{-6}.

At t=0:

= 0 + (2.7777778) e^{0} = 2.7777778.

So the definite integral is [ (-13.8888889 e^{-6}) ] - 2.7777778.

So that's (-13.8888889 e^{-6} ) - 2.7777778.

Wait, no, because when you subtract the lower limit from the upper limit, it's [upper] - [lower].

So it's [ (-13.8888889 e^{-6}) ] - [ 2.7777778 ].

Wait, but that would be (-13.8888889 e^{-6} - 2.7777778 ), which is a negative number. But wait, the integral of a positive function (since c(t) is positive for t in [0,10]) shouldn't be negative. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the signs somewhere.

Wait, let me recompute the integration by parts. The integral is ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du.

So for ∫ t e^{-0.6 t} dt, u = t => du = dt.

dv = e^{-0.6 t} dt => v = (-1/0.6) e^{-0.6 t}.

So ∫ t e^{-0.6 t} dt = u v - ∫ v du = t*(-1/0.6)e^{-0.6 t} - ∫ (-1/0.6) e^{-0.6 t} dt.

Simplify:

= (-t/(0.6)) e^{-0.6 t} + (1/0.6) ∫ e^{-0.6 t} dt.

The integral of e^{-0.6 t} is (-1/0.6) e^{-0.6 t}.

So putting it all together:

= (-t/(0.6)) e^{-0.6 t} + (1/0.6) * [ (-1/0.6) e^{-0.6 t} ) ] + C.

= (-t/(0.6)) e^{-0.6 t} - (1/(0.6)^2) e^{-0.6 t} + C.

Ah, so the integral is [ (-t/(0.6) - 1/(0.6)^2 ) e^{-0.6 t} ] evaluated from 0 to 10.

Wait a second, so when I plug in the limits, let me compute that correctly.

So the integral from 0 to10 is [ (-t/(0.6) - 1/(0.6)^2 ) e^{-0.6 t} ] evaluated at t=10 minus same at t=0.

At t=10:

= (-10/(0.6) - 1/(0.36) ) e^{-6}.

= ( -16.6666667 - 2.7777778 ) e^{-6}.

= (-19.4444445) e^{-6}.

At t=0:

= ( -0 - 2.7777778 ) e^{0} = (-2.7777778)(1) = -2.7777778.

So the definite integral is [ (-19.4444445 e^{-6}) ] - [ (-2.7777778) ].

Which is (-19.4444445 e^{-6}) + 2.7777778.

Hmm, that makes more sense because the integral is positive.

So the integral of c(t) dt without the 20 factor is [ (-19.4444445 e^{-6}) + 2.7777778 ].

But wait, now I have to multiply by 20, because c(t) is 20 t e^{-0.6 t}.

So the integral becomes 20 * [ (-19.4444445 e^{-6} ) + 2.7777778 ].

Now compute the numerical value.

Compute each term:

First, e^{-6} is approximately e^(-6) ≈ 0.002478752.

So let's compute each part.

-19.4444445 * 0.002478752 ≈ let's calculate:

19.4444445 * 0.002478752 ≈ 

Well, 20 * 0.002478752 is 0.04957504.

So 19.4444... is approximately 20 - 0.55555..., so 0.55555 * 0.002478752 ≈ 0.001377.

So 19.4444 * 0.002478752 ≈ 0.04957504 - 0.001377 ≈ 0.048198.

But since it's negative, that's -0.048198.

Then the second term is 2.7777778.

So the integral is 20 * [ (-0.048198) + 2.7777778 ].

Which is 20 * (2.7777778 - 0.048198).

Compute 2.7777778 - 0.048198 = 2.7295798.

Multiply by 20: 20 * 2.7295798 ≈ 54.5916 mg·s/L.

Wait, because the integral's unit is (mg/L) * s, since c(t) is mg/L and dt is in seconds.

Now, the cardiac output formula is CO = D / ∫c(t) dt.

But wait, D is 6 mg, and the integral is in (mg·s)/L.

Wait, so ∫c(t) dt has units mg/L * s, because c(t) is mg/L, dt is seconds.

So the integral is (mg/L) * s.

So D is 6 mg.

So CO would be (6 mg) / (54.5916 mg·s/L) ) → the mg cancels, s remains in the denominator.

But wait, that would give units of L/s, but CO is in L/min.

So we need to convert seconds to minutes.

So let's compute the numbers:

CO = 6 mg / (54.5916 mg·s/L) ) = (6 /54.5916 ) L/s.

6 divided by 54.5916 is approximately 0.11 L/s.

But to convert L/s to L/min, multiply by 60 s/min.

So 0.11 L/s *60 s/min = 6.6 L/min.

Wait, so that would be option C: 6.6 L/min.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake in the integral evaluation.

Let me recompute the integral of c(t) from 0 to10.

We have ∫0^10 20 t e^{-0.6 t} dt = 20 * [ (-t/(0.6) - 1/(0.6)^2 ) e^{-0.6 t} ] from 0 to10.

At t=10:

=20 * [ (-10/0.6 - 1/(0.36) ) e^{-6} ]

=20 * [ (-16.6666667 - 2.7777778 ) e^{-6} ]

=20 * [ (-19.4444445) * e^{-6} ]

e^{-6} ≈ 0.002478752.

So (-19.4444445) * 0.002478752 ≈ -0.048198.

Multiply by 20: 20 * (-0.048198) ≈ -0.96396.

At t=0:

=20 * [ (0 - 2.7777778 ) e^{0} ]

=20 * (-2.7777778 ) *1 = -55.555556.

So the definite integral is [ -0.96396 ] - [ -55.555556 ] = (-0.96396 +55.555556) = 54.5916 mg·s/L.

So D is 6 mg, so CO is 6 / (54.5916) = 0.11 L/s. Multiply by 60 to get L/min: 0.11 *60=6.6 L/min.

So the answer is option C:6.6 L/min.

The dye dilution method is used to measure cardiac output by injecting a known amount of dye into the bloodstream and measuring its concentration over time. The concentration is modeled by \( c(t) = 20 t e^{-0.6 t} \), where \( t \) is in seconds, and the total dye injected is \( 6 \, \mathrm{mg} \). The cardiac output (CO) is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{CO} = \frac{\text{D}}{\int_0^{10} c(t) \, dt}
\]

where \( D \) is the total dye (in mg), and the integral represents the area under the concentration-time curve. The integral of \( c(t) \) is:

\[
\int_0^{10} 20 t e^{-0.6 t} \, dt
\]

Using integration by parts, the integral of \( t e^{-0.6 t} \) is:

\[
\int t e^{-0.6 t} \, dt = \left[ -\frac{t}{0.6} e^{-0.6 t} - \frac{1}{(0.6)^2} e^{-0.6 t} \right]
\]

Evaluating this from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 10 \):

1. At \( t = 10 \):
   \[
   \left[ -\frac{10}{0.6} e^{-6} - \frac{1}{(0.6)^2} e^{-6} \right] = \left[ -16.6667 e^{-6} - 2.7778 e^{-6} \right] = -19.4444 e^{-6}
   \]

2. At \( t = 0 \):
   \[
   \left[ -\frac{0}{0.6} e^{0} - \frac{1}{(0.6)^2} e^{0} \right] = -2.7778
   \]

The definite integral is:
\[
\int_0^{10} t e^{-0.6 t} \, dt = \left[ -19.4444 e^{-6} \right] - \left[ -2.7778 \right] = -19.4444 e^{-6} + 2.7778
\]

Substituting \( e^{-6} \approx 0.002478752 \):
\[
-19.4444 \cdot 0.002478752 \approx -0.0482
\]
\[
\int_0^{10} t e^{-0.6 t} \, dt \approx -0.0482 + 2.7778 = 2.7296
\]

Multiplying by 20 (from \( c(t) = 20 t e^{-0.6 t} \)):
\[
\int_0^{10} c(t) \, dt = 20 \cdot 2.7296 = 54.592 \, \mathrm
