Question:

A grocery store purchased a large mirror to hang on a wall in the store. Along with the mirror itself, the manufacturer provided brackets and bolts to be used for hanging the mirror. The grocery store paid a local carpenter to come in and hang the mirror. A few days after the carpenter installed the mirror, the mirror suddenly fell from the wall because of a defect in the brackets. It struck a shopper on the head, causing serious injuries to him. If the shopper asserts a claim against the carpenter based on strict liability in tort, the plaintiff will

Options:

A: prevail, because the brackets were defective when installed.
B: prevail, because it would be abnormally dangerous to maintain such a large mirror on the wall of a retail outlet.
C: not prevail, because the carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror.
D: not prevail, because the carpenter had no relationship of privily with the plaintiff.

Okay, so I've got this tort question here about strict liability. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. I remember that strict liability is one of the theories in tort law, especially in product liability cases. But wait, when does strict liability apply?

The question is about a grocery store that bought a mirror. The manufacturer provided brackets and bolts, and the store hired a carpenter to install it. Then the mirror fell because the brackets were defective, injuring a shopper. The shopper is suing the carpenter under strict liability.

So, who can be held strictly liable? I think strict liability in tort applies to manufacturers and sometimes to sellers or distributors if certain conditions are met. The idea is that they are in the business of selling products and can spread the risk through prices. But does that apply to someone like a carpenter who just installs the product?

Wait, the carpenter is an independent contractor. He wasn't manufacturing or selling the mirror; he was just installing it. The brackets were provided by the manufacturer, so the defect was already present when the carpenter got them. The carpenter's role was to hang the mirror using those brackets. If the brackets were defective, maybe the manufacturer is at fault, but the carpenter?

Strict liability usually applies to the chain of distributionâ€”manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer. But what about someone who installs it? I don't think installers are typically considered part of that chain for strict liability. They're more like service providers. So if the product was defective when they received it, and they didn't do anything wrong in the installation beyond that, would they be liable?

Wait, but maybe if the carpenter was negligent in the installation, that's a different story. But the question is about strict liability, not negligence. So the focus is on whether the carpenter is a "commercial supplier" of the product. If the carpenter is just providing a service, not selling the product, then strict liability might not apply.

Looking at the options, option C says the carpenter wasn't engaged in the sale of the mirror. That makes sense because he's installing, not selling. So the shopper wouldn't prevail against the carpenter under strict liability. 

Other options: Option A says the brackets were defective when installed. But the defect was from the manufacturer, not the carpenter. So even if the brackets were defective, the carpenter didn't cause that. Option B talks about abnormally dangerous activities, which is more about nuisance or certain types of strict liability for activities, but I don't think hanging a mirror is considered abnormally dangerous per se. Plus, the issue is the product defect, not the activity itself.

Option D mentions privity. I thought privity was more of an issue in warranty, but strict liability doesn't require privity anymore, thanks to cases like MacPherson v. Buick. So D doesn't seem right. 

So putting it together, the correct answer should be C: the carpenter wasn't engaged in the sale, so strict liability doesn't apply.

The question revolves around whether a carpenter can be held strictly liable for injuries caused by a defective mirror that fell due to faulty brackets provided by the manufacturer. Strict liability typically applies to those in the chain of distribution, such as manufacturers, wholesalers, or retailers, who are in the business of selling products. However, the carpenter in this scenario was an independent contractor hired to install the mirror using the provided brackets. He was not engaged in the sale of the mirror but rather provided a service. 

Strict liability does not extend to service providers like installers unless they are part of the commercial supply chain. Since the defect in the brackets was not caused by the carpenter and he was merely installing the product, strict liability does not apply to him. The manufacturer, who provided the defective brackets, would be the more appropriate party to hold strictly liable.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The defect in the brackets existed before the carpenter installed them, and he did not cause the defect.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Hanging a mirror is not inherently an abnormally dangerous activity, and strict liability here is based on product defects, not the activity itself.
- **Option C**: Correct. The carpenter was not engaged in the sale of the mirror and is not part of the product's distribution chain, so strict liability does not apply.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Privity is not a requirement for strict liability in modern tort law, as established in cases like *MacPherson v. Buick*.

Thus, the shopper would not prevail against the carpenter under strict liability.
