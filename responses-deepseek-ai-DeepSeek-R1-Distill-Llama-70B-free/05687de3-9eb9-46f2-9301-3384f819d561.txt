Okay, so I've got this chemistry question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about molecular geometry and bonding. Hmm, the question says: which geometry corresponds to a substance with five sigma bonds and one nonbonding pair of electrons.

Wait, I remember that sigma bonds are the single bonds formed by the head-on overlap of atomic orbitals. Each single bond is a sigma bond. So the molecule in question has five of these. Also, there's a lone pair, a nonbonding pair of electrons. So that's one lone pair in the structure.

I think I should start by considering the VSEPR theory, which is about the arrangement of electron pairs around a central atom. The basic idea is that electron pairs (whether bonding or nonbonding) repel each other and arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible.

The number of electron regions (which include both bonding and lone pairs) determines the basic geometry. So first, I need to figure out how many electron regions there are. Let's see: each sigma bond counts as one region. So five sigma bonds mean five regions. Plus the one lone pair adds another region. So total regions are 5 + 1 = 6.

Wait, but wait. Wait, wait. No, wait. Because the lone pair is an electron region as well. So the total number of electron regions is 5 (from sigma bonds) plus 1 lone pair, making 6 regions. But wait, each sigma bond is a single bond, so each is one region. Oh wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up something. Let me think again.

Wait, no, each sigma bond is a single bond, which is one electron region. So the number of electron regions is the number of sigma bonds plus the number of lone pairs. So in this case, 5 sigma bonds (so 5 regions) and 1 lone pair (1 region), so total of 6 regions.

Wait, but wait, I think I might be making a mistake here. Because each sigma bond is a bonding region, but the lone pair is a nonbonding region. So the number of electron regions is 5 (sigma bonds) + 1 (lone pair) = 6 regions. So the structure around the central atom has six regions.

Now, according to VSEPR, six electron regions would arrange themselves in an octahedral geometry. But wait, does that mean the molecular geometry is octahedral? Or is it something else when considering lone pairs?

Wait, no. The molecular geometry is determined by the arrangement of atoms, not lone pairs. The electron geometry includes both bonding and lone pairs. So if there are six regions (five bonding, one lone), the electron geometry is octahedral.

But the question is about the molecular geometry, which is the shape based on the atoms only. So for example, in an octahedral electron geometry with one lone pair, the molecular geometry would be square pyramidal, right? Because in an octahedral setup, if you have one lone pair, it would occupy one position, and the five bonding pairs would form a square base plus one on top, making a square pyramid.

Wait, no. Let me think again. So when you have six electron regions (five bonding, one lone), the electron geometry is octahedral. But the molecular geometry depends on the positions of the atoms. So in that case, the molecule would have five bonding pairs and one lone pair. So the lone pair takes up one of the positions in the octahedral arrangement. So the atoms are arranged in a way that leaves one position empty (where the lone pair is). So the molecular shape would have five atoms around the central atom, arranged with one lone pair.

Wait, but if the central atom has five sigma bonds, that means it's bonded to five other atoms. So the central atom has five bonding regions and one lone pair. So six regions total.

So the electron geometry is octahedral. But the molecular geometry (shape) is determined by the positions of the atoms. So when there are five bonding regions and one lone pair in an octahedral electron geometry, the molecular geometry is square pyramidal. Because imagine an octahedron: if you have a lone pair in one of the axial positions, the five bonding pairs would form a square base and one on the opposite side. Wait, no, that's if the lone pair is in the equatorial position. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think about the examples I know. For example, BrF5 has a square pyramidal geometry. Wait, no, BrF5 has six regions: five bonding and one lone pair, so its electron geometry is octahedral, and molecular geometry is square pyramidal. Because in BrF5, bromine is in the center with five fluorine atoms attached. But wait, wait, BrF5 has five bonding pairs and one lone pair, so that's six regions. So the molecular geometry is square pyramidal, which is option G.

But wait, another example: I think SF4 has a trigonal bipyramidal geometry, or perhaps it's seesaw. Wait, no, SF4 has four bonding pairs and one lone pair. Wait, that's five regions, so trigonal bipyramidal. So the molecular geometry would be seesaw, but I'm not sure.

Wait, back to the question: five sigma bonds (so five bonding regions) and one lone pair (nonbonding). So six regions total. So the electron geometry is octahedral. But the molecular geometry, which is based on the arrangement of atoms, would have the lone pair in one position. So when you have six regions (five bonds, one lone), the molecular shape is square pyramidal. So the answer would be square pyramid, which is option G.

Let me check the options again. The options are A to J.

Option G: Square pyramid.

Yes, that makes sense because the central atom is bonded to five others, and has one lone pair. So the shape is square pyramidal.

To determine the geometry corresponding to a substance with five sigma bonds and one nonbonding pair of electrons, we use the VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory. Each sigma bond represents a bonding region, and the lone pair represents a nonbonding region. Thus, the central atom has a total of six electron regions: five bonding regions (from the sigma bonds) and one nonbonding region (the lone pair).

According to VSEPR theory, six electron regions arrange themselves in an octahedral electron geometry. However, the molecular geometry is determined by the arrangement of the atoms, ignoring the lone pair. In this case, the lone pair occupies one of the positions in the octahedral arrangement, leaving five bonding regions to form the molecular geometry. This results in a square pyramidal shape, where the central atom is bonded to five atoms, and the lone pair occupies the sixth position.

Among the given options, the correct molecular geometry is **Square pyramid**.
