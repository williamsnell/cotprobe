Okay, so I have this question about Anscombe and what she claims an adequate moral psychology would include. Hmm, I remember that Anscombe was a philosopher, right? She did some influential work in ethics and the philosophy of action. Wait, wasn't she the one who wrote about "Modern Moral Philosophy"? I think in that paper she criticized some trends in moral philosophy and maybe suggested that more attention should be paid to certain concepts.

The question gives options from A to J. Let me go through them one by one. 

Option A says a detailed understanding of societal norms and expectations. That sounds like it's about social norms, which I'm not sure is Anscombe's focus. She might be more into the structure of actions and intentions rather than societal norms.

Option B is a comprehensive review of historical theories. While she does discuss historical philosophers, like Aristotle, I don't think she's saying that's the main thing for moral psychology. It's more about the current framework.

Option C mentions personal experiences influencing moral decisions. That could be part of psychology, but I'm not sure if that's specifically what Anscombe emphasizes. She might be more concerned with the structure of intention and action.

Option D is analyses of concepts like "action" and "intention." Oh yeah, I remember she wrote a book called "Intention" where she explored these concepts in depth. So this seems relevant. She argues that understanding action and intention is crucial for moral psychology.

Option E is integrating religious beliefs. I don't think she focuses on religion specifically. Her work is more secular in approach, I believe.

Option F is studying the subconscious mind. That sounds more like Freudian psychology, which I don't think is her main point. She's more into philosophical analysis than subconscious aspects.

Option G is all of the above. Hmm, I don't think that's right because she was critical of certain approaches and focused on specific areas.

Option H is exploring 'good' and 'evil.' While important in ethics, I think she was more about the underlying structures of action and intention rather than directly tackling good and evil.

Option I is answering the mind-body problem. That's a different area of philosophy, more metaphysics, which I don't think she's addressing here.

Option J is explaining free will. She might touch upon it, but I think her main focus is on intention and action as foundational concepts.

Putting it all together, Anscombe's moral psychology emphasizes understanding the nature of action and intention. So the correct answer should be D.
</think>

Anscombe's work emphasizes the importance of understanding fundamental concepts such as "action" and "intention" in moral psychology. Her influential book *Intention* delves into these topics, highlighting their centrality to ethical analysis. While other options touch on related areas, they do not capture the core of her argument. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D

Answer: D
