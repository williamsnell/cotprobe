Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these calculations. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the atomic weight of nitrogen based on the weight percentage in ammonia. I remember that ammonia is NH3, so each molecule has one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms. 

The problem states that the weight-percent of nitrogen in ammonia is 82.25%. Weight-percent, or mass percent, means that in every 100 grams of ammonia, 82.25 grams are nitrogen and the remaining must be hydrogen. So, if I have 100 grams of NH3, 82.25g is N and 17.75g is H.

Now, I know that the atomic weight of hydrogen is given as 1.008. So each H atom contributes 1.008 to the molar mass. Since each ammonia molecule has three H atoms, the total mass contributed by hydrogen in one mole of NH3 would be 3 * 1.008.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the atomic weight of nitrogen. Let's think about moles. The mass percent can help me find the molar mass of NH3 first, and then I can break it down into N and H.

So, for 100g of NH3:
- N: 82.25g
- H: 17.75g

The molar mass of NH3 would be the sum of the molar masses of N and H. Let me denote the atomic weight of N as x. Then, the molar mass of NH3 is x (for N) plus 3*(1.008) (for H), because each molecule has three H atoms.

The mass of one mole of NH3 is (x + 3*1.008) grams. And from the problem, 100g of NH3 is 82.25% N, so 100g is (x + 3*1.008) * moles, but maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, mass percent is (mass of N in NH3) / (molar mass of NH3) ) * 100. So:

82.25% = (x) / (x + 3*1.008) ) * 100.

Yes, that makes sense because in one mole of NH3, there's one mole of N (mass x) and three moles of H (mass 3*1.008). So the total molar mass is x + 3*1.008, and the fraction that is N is x divided by that sum.

So the equation becomes:

82.25 = (x) / (x + 3*1.008) * 100.

Let me write that out numerically. 3*1.008 is 3.024.

So,

82.25 = (x) / (x + 3.024) * 100.

Divide both sides by 100 to get 0.8225 = x/(x+3.024).

Now, solving for x:

0.8225 = x / (x + 3.024)

Multiply both sides by (x + 3.024):

0.8225*(x + 3.024) = x

Expanding the left side:

0.8225x + 0.8225*3.024 = x

Calculate 0.8225 *3.024. Let me compute that.

3.024 *0.8 is 2.4192, and 3.024*0.0225 is about 0.06804. So adding those together: approx 2.4192 + 0.06804 = 2.48724.

So the equation becomes:

0.8225x + 2.48724 = x

Subtract 0.8225x from both sides:

2.48724 = x - 0.8225x

Which simplifies to:

2.48724 = 0.1775x

Now, solve for x:

x = 2.48724 / 0.1775.

Let me compute that. Hmm. Let's see:

0.1775 is approximately 0.1775. 2.48724 divided by 0.1775.

Well, 0.1775 times 14 is 2.485. Oh wait, 0.1775 *14 = ?

0.1775 *10 = 1.775.

0.1775 *4= 0.71.

1.775 + 0.71 = 2.485.

So 14 times 0.1775 is 2.485. Our numerator is 2.48724, which is a bit higher, so x is a bit more than 14.

Wait, 2.48724 - 2.485 = 0.00224.

So 0.00224 divided by 0.1775 gives approximately 0.0126. So x is approximately 14.0126.

Looking at the options, option A is 14.01. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure.

So, the equation was:

82.25% = (x) / (x + 3*1.008) * 100.

Which simplifies to x/(x+3.024) = 0.8225.

Cross multiply: x = 0.8225*(x +3.024).

Expanding: x = 0.8225x + 0.8225*3.024.

Subtract 0.8225x: x -0.8225x = 0.8225*3.024.

0.1775x = let's calculate 0.8225 *3.024.

Wait, 3.024 * 0.8 is 2.4192, and 3.024 *0.0225 is 0.06804. Adding those gives 2.48724 as before.

So 0.1775x = 2.48724 → x=2.48724 /0.1775.

Let me compute that more precisely.

0.1775 = 1775/10000.

So 2.48724 ÷ 0.1775 = 2.48724 * (10000/1775)

Wait, 1775 *14 = 24850. 24850/1000 = 24.85. Wait, that's a different approach.

Alternatively, compute 2.48724 / 0.1775.

Let me do it step by step.

0.1775 × 14 = 2.485, as before. So 14 gives us 2.485, and we have 2.48724.

The difference is 2.48724 -2.485 = 0.00224.

So how much more than 14 do we need? So 0.00224 /0.1775 per additional x.

0.00224 /0.1775 = approximately 0.0126.

So x ≈14.0126.

Which is about 14.01 when rounded to two decimal places.

Looking back at the options, option A is 14.01. So that's the correct answer.

To determine the atomic weight of nitrogen (N) based on the given data:

1. Ammonia (NH₃) consists of 1 nitrogen atom and 3 hydrogen atoms. The weight-percent of nitrogen in ammonia is 82.25%, meaning in 100 g of NH₃, 82.25 g is nitrogen and 17.75 g is hydrogen.

2. The molar mass of NH₃ is the sum of the atomic weights of its constituent atoms. Let the atomic weight of nitrogen be \( x \). The atomic weight of hydrogen is given as 1.008, so the molar mass of NH₃ is:

   \[
   \text{Molar mass of NH₃} = x + 3 \times 1.008 = x + 3.024
   \]

3. The mass percent of nitrogen in NH₃ can be expressed as:

   \[
   \text{Mass percent of N} = \frac{\text{Mass of N}}{\text{Molar mass of NH₃}} \times 100
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   82.25 = \frac{x}{x + 3.024} \times 100
   \]

4. Simplify the equation:

   \[
   0.8225 = \frac{x}{x + 3.024}
   \]

   Multiply through by \( x + 3.024 \):

   \[
   0.8225(x + 3.024) = x
   \]

   Expand and rearrange:

   \[
   0.8225x + 0.8225 \times 3.024 = x
   \]

   \[
   0.8225x + 2.48724 = x
   \]

   Subtract \( 0.8225x \) from both sides:

   \[
   2.48724 = 0.1775x
   \]

5. Solve for \( x \):

   \[
   x = \frac{2.48724}{0.1775} \approx 14.01
   \]

Thus, the atomic weight of nitrogen is approximately **14.01**.

The correct answer is:

**A: 14.01**
