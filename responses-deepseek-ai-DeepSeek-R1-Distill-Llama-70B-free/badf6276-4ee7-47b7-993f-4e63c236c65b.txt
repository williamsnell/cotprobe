Alright, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I need to translate the sentence "All first-year students take a swim test" into predicate logic. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand the sentence structure. The subject is "all first-year students," and the predicate is "take a swim test." In logic terms, I think I'll need to use a universal quantifier because it's talking about every member of the group.

Let me define some predicates to make this easier. Let's say Sx means "x is a first-year student," and Fx means "x takes a swim test." Wait, actually, maybe that's not the best way. Alternatively, maybe Sx should be "x is a first-year student," and Fx could be "x takes a swim test." Or perhaps another way around. Wait, no, the way I have it makes sense: Sx is the student, Fx is taking the test.

Wait, no, perhaps I should define Fx as "x takes a swim test." So the sentence is saying that for every x, if x is a first-year student, then x takes a swim test. So in logical terms, that would be for all x, Sx implies Fx. So symbolically, that's ∀x (Sx → Fx).

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this structure. Let's go through each option.

Option A: ∀x (Sx ⊃ Fx). That looks exactly like what I have. So that's a possible candidate.

Option B: ∀x (Fx ≡ Sx). That's a biconditional, meaning Fx is true if and only if Sx is true. But the original statement doesn't say that; it's a one-way implication. So B is not correct.

Option C: ∀x (Sx ∨ Fx). This is saying for every x, either x is a first-year student or x takes the swim test. That's not the same as all first-year students taking the test. It includes cases where non-students might take the test, which isn't what the sentence states. So C is out.

Option D: ∀x (Sx ≡ Fx). Again, a biconditional, same issue as B. So D is incorrect.

Option E: ∀x (Sx ∧ Fx). This would mean every x is both a first-year student and takes the swim test, which isn't the case. The statement doesn't claim that everyone takes the test, only that all first-year students do. So E is wrong.

Option F: ∀x (Fx ∨ Sx). Similar to C, it's an OR statement, which doesn't capture the implication. So F is incorrect.

Option G: ∀x (~Sx ⊃ Fx). This is saying that if x is not a first-year student, then x takes the swim test. That's the opposite of what we want. We want first-year students to take the test, not non-students. So G is wrong.

Option H: ∀x (Fx ∧ Sx). Same as E, meaning everyone is both a first-year student and takes the test, which isn't right. So H is out.

Option I: ∀x (Fx ⊃ ~Sx). This would mean that if x takes the test, then x is not a first-year student. That's the opposite of our original statement. So I is incorrect.

Option J: ∀x (Fx ⊃ Sx). This would mean if x takes the swim test, then x is a first-year student. But the original statement is about all first-year students taking the test, not about who takes the test being students. So J is not correct either.

Wait, let me double-check. The original statement is "All first-year students take a swim test." So it's Sx → Fx for all x, which is option A.

I think I got it right. So the correct answer should be option A.

The sentence "All first-year students take a swim test" can be translated into predicate logic by defining Sx as "x is a first-year student" and Fx as "x takes a swim test." The sentence implies that for every x, if x is a first-year student, then x takes a swim test. This is expressed logically as ∀x (Sx → Fx).

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: ∀x (Sx ⊃ Fx) matches the structure of the sentence exactly.
- **B**: ∀x (Fx ≡ Sx) is incorrect because it implies a biconditional relationship, which is not stated.
- **C**: ∀x (Sx ∨ Fx) is incorrect because it suggests an OR condition, not the specific implication.
- **D**: ∀x (Sx ≡ Fx) is incorrect for the same reason as B.
- **E**: ∀x (Sx ∧ Fx) is incorrect because it implies every x is both a student and takes the test.
- **F**: ∀x (Fx ∨ Sx) is incorrect for the same reason as C.
- **G**: ∀x (~Sx ⊃ Fx) is incorrect because it implies non-students take the test.
- **H**: ∀x (Fx ∧ Sx) is incorrect for the same reason as E.
- **I**: ∀x (Fx ⊃ ~Sx) is incorrect because it implies taking the test means not being a student.
- **J**: ∀x (Fx ⊃ Sx) is incorrect because it implies taking the test means being a student, which is not the original statement.

The correct translation is **A**.
