Okay, so I've got this question here: "How many trees are there on 5 unlabeled vertices?" And I have to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my graph theory, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that trees are connected acyclic graphs. So, the question is about counting the number of distinct trees when considering unlabeled vertices. Wait, unlabeled means that the vertices aren't named, so two trees are the same if one can be transformed into the other by relabeling the vertices. So, it's about isomorphism classes of trees with 5 nodes.

I think there's a formula or a method to count the number of unlabeled trees with n nodes. Oh right, I remember something called Cayley's formula. Wait, Cayley's formula gives the number of labeled trees, right? So for n labeled vertices, the number is n^(n-2). Let me check that: for n=5, that would be 5^(3) = 125 labeled trees. But the question is about unlabeled trees, so that's a different number.

So I need to find the number of non-isomorphic trees with 5 nodes. I think the numbers for small n are known and maybe I can recall them or figure them out.

Let me think about the possible structures. For n=1, it's just 1 tree. For n=2, also 1. For n=3, there's only one tree as well, a straight line of three nodes. Wait, no, wait. Wait n=3: three nodes connected in a line. No, wait, for n=3, you have three nodes connected as a path, which is just one tree. So 1 for n=3.

n=4: I think there are two trees. One is the path graph (like a straight line), and the other is a star where one central node connected to all others. So two trees for n=4.

n=5: So I need to count how many non-isomorphic trees exist with 5 nodes. Let me try to list the possibilities.

I recall that the number of unlabeled trees on n nodes is given by the sequence A000055 in the OEIS, which starts as 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, etc. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Wait, let me think: for n=5, I think the number is 3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, let me try to list all possible trees on 5 nodes. So trees are determined by their structure, not the labels.

One way to approach this is to consider the possible degrees of the nodes. In a tree, the sum of degrees is 2(n-1), which for n=5 is 8. Also, the number of leaves is at least two.

So for five nodes, let's think about the possible degree sequences. Each tree must have at least two leaves (nodes with degree 1).

Option 1: All nodes have degree 1 except two nodes. Wait, but that can't be because the sum would be too low. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the possible structures.

Another approach is to consider the number of edges. A tree has n-1 edges, so for n=5, it's 4 edges.

Let me try to enumerate the possible structures:

1. The path graph: All nodes arranged in a straight line. Each internal node has degree 2 except the ends. So it's a straight path: A-B-C-D-E. That's one tree.

2. A tree with a central node connected to others. Like a star, but maybe not all connected to one node. Wait, no, for 5 nodes, one node can't be connected to all others because that would require 4 edges, and with 4 edges, that's possible. Wait, the star tree would have one central node connected to all others. So that's another tree: one node of degree 4, others leaves. But wait, that's possible only if that central node has degree 4, but wait, in a tree with 5 nodes, the maximum degree a node can have is 4. So that's a second tree.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me correct that: in a tree of 5 nodes, a star-shaped tree would have a central node connected to all four others, which is a degree of 4. So that's one tree.

But wait, perhaps there's another structure where the tree isn't a straight path or a star. Like maybe a tree where there's a node connected to three others, and one of those is connected to another node.

Wait, that would be a central node with degree 3, and one of its neighbors has degree 2, and the others are leaves.

Wait, let me draw this out mentally. Imagine node A connected to B, C, D, and E. No, that's the star, which is the second case.

Another possibility is a tree where one node has degree 3, connected to three leaves, and one of those is connected to another node. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think of the possible degree sequences.

For five nodes, the degree sequences of trees must satisfy:

- Sum of degrees is 8 (since 5 nodes, 4 edges, each edge contributes 2 to the sum).
- Each node has degree at least 1.
- At least two nodes have degree 1 (leaves).

So possible degree sequences:

1. 4,1,1,1,1 → the star tree.
2. 3,2,1,1,1 → a node with degree 3, one with degree 2, and three leaves.
3. 2,2,2,1,1 → three nodes with degree 2, and two leaves. Wait, but wait, can a tree have three nodes of degree 2?

Wait, in a tree, if you have three nodes of degree 2, that would imply a structure like a path with three internal nodes. Let's see, for 5 nodes in a path, the two end nodes have degree 1, and the three internal nodes have degree 2. Wait, that's not possible because a path of 5 nodes has 4 edges, so only four nodes. Wait, no, a path of 5 nodes has 4 edges and 5 nodes arranged as A-B-C-D-E, so nodes B, C, D have degree 2, and A and E have degree 1. So that's the degree sequence (2,2,2,1,1), sum is 2+2+2+1+1=8. So that's another tree, the path graph.

Wait, so then the possible degree sequences are:

- 4,1,1,1,1 → star.
- 3,2,1,1,1 → another structure.
- 2,2,2,1,1 → path graph.

Wait, so that's three different degree sequences. So does that mean there are three unlabeled trees on 5 nodes? Because each degree sequence would correspond to a unique isomorphism class.

Wait, but wait, maybe there's another structure. Let me see.

Wait, another possible degree sequence is 3,1,1,1,2? No, that's the same as 3,2,1,1,1. Oh, but wait, no, the degrees are ordered in non-increasing order, so 3,2,1,1,1 is correct.

Wait, but let me think: the degree sequences for trees on 5 nodes are as follows.

Option 1: All nodes except two are leaves. One node has degree 3, another has degree 2, and the rest are leaves.

So the tree would look like a central node connected to three leaves and one node, which is connected to another leaf. Wait, that's possible.

Wait, but that would give a degree sequence of 3,2,1,1,1 as I thought earlier.

So that's a third tree. So that would make three trees.

Wait, but wait, another thought: the path graph is one tree, the star is another, and then the third is the one with a node of degree 3 and a node of degree 2. So that's three trees.

But wait, I'm pretty sure that for n=5, the number of unlabeled trees is 3. So the answer would be option A, which is 3.

But wait, I'm a bit uncertain. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, I can refer to the known sequence. I think the number of unlabeled trees on n nodes is as follows:

n | number of trees
1 | 1
2 | 1
3 | 1
4 | 2
5 | 3
6 | 6
7 | 11
8 | 23
...

Wait, so for n=5, it's 3. So the answer is 3, which is option A.

But wait, I should double-check. Another way is to think about the possible structures.

1. The star (one central node connected to all others).
2. The path (a straight line of 5 nodes).
3. A tree where there's a node connected to three others, one of which connects to another node (so like a Y shape).

So that's three distinct structures, so three unlabeled trees.

Therefore, the answer is A:3.

To determine the number of trees on 5 unlabeled vertices, we need to count the distinct non-isomorphic trees, as unlabeled vertices mean two trees are considered the same if they can be transformed into one another by relabeling.

A tree is a connected acyclic graph, and for \( n = 5 \), the number of edges is \( n-1 = 4 \). The problem can be approached by analyzing the possible degree sequences of the vertices, which must satisfy:

1. The sum of degrees is \( 2(n-1) = 8 \) (since each edge contributes 2 to the sum of degrees).
2. Each vertex has a degree of at least 1.
3. At least two vertices are leaves (degree 1).

The possible degree sequences for trees on 5 vertices are:

1. \( (4,1,1,1,1) \): A star tree, where one central node is connected to all other nodes.
2. \( (3,2,1,1,1) \): A tree with one node of degree 3, one node of degree 2, and three leaves.
3. \( (2,2,2,1,1) \): A path graph, where two end nodes are leaves (degree 1) and the three internal nodes have degree 2.

Each degree sequence corresponds to a unique isomorphism class of trees. Thus, there are 3 distinct unlabeled trees on 5 vertices.

The answer is **A: 3**.
