Okay, so I need to figure out why Parfit opposes equality based on the given options. I'm a bit rusty on Parfit's views, but I remember he had some interesting arguments in ethics, particularly in his book "Reasons and Persons." Let me try to recall.

Parfit was known for his discussions on personal identity and ethical theories. I think he also talked about different approaches to distributive justice, like utilitarianism versus egalitarianism. Oh right, there was something about the "repugnant conclusion" related to population ethics, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

Wait, the question is about his stance on equality. I think Parfit might have been critical of certain equality-focused principles. Maybe he had arguments against the importance of equality as a primary goal. I remember something about him discussing how equality could sometimes conflict with other values, like overall well-being or happiness.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: He claims that by giving priority to the needs of the poor, we can increase equality. That sounds more like a pro-equality argument, maybe from someone like Rawls with the difference principle. So probably not Parfit opposing equality.

Option B: He rejects the idea of equality altogether. That seems too strong. I think Parfit might question the primacy of equality but not necessarily reject it entirely. Maybe he thinks it's not the only consideration.

Option C: He believes equality is not a realistic goal. Not sure, but I don't recall Parfit making an argument based on feasibility. His arguments were more theoretical.

Option D: He argues that an unequal society is inevitable. That sounds deterministic. I don't think Parfit took that stance; he was more about the moral implications rather than inevitability.

Option E: He suggests that societal structures inherently support inequality. Again, this feels more about structural causes rather than his ethical stance. I'm not sure he made that argument.

Option F: He asserts that we are each responsible for our poverty. That seems like a libertarian view, but I don't think Parfit focused on individual responsibility in that way. His work was more about the moral theories than personal responsibility.

Option G: He posits that striving for equality undermines individual freedoms. Hmm, this rings a bell. I think Parfit discussed how some egalitarian principles might require sacrificing individual freedoms or lead to worse overall outcomes. Maybe he argued that equality can come at the cost of other important values.

Option H: He argues that inequality is necessary for competition and progress. That sounds more like a defense of capitalism or meritocracy, not sure if Parfit took this position. I think his arguments were more about the moral implications rather than the benefits of inequality.

Option I: He contends that inequality is a natural human condition. I don't recall Parfit saying that. It sounds more like a biological or anthropological argument, which doesn't fit his ethical discussions.

So, putting it together, I think Parfit's opposition to equality, or at least his skepticism, comes from the idea that pursuing equality might conflict with other values like individual freedom or overall happiness. Option G says that striving for equality undermines individual freedoms, which aligns with what I remember about his critiques of egalitarianism.

Parfit's opposition to equality stems from his critique of egalitarian principles, where he argues that striving for equality can undermine individual freedoms and other important values. This aligns with his broader ethical discussions, which often emphasized the conflict between equality and other moral considerations.
