To studythe characteristics of this motion, an enlarged model of thebody is tested in 60°F water. The model ratio \lambda is8 :1. Determine the velocity at which this enlarged model should bepulled through the water to achieve dynamic similarity. If thedrag force on the model is 0.80 lb, predict the drag force onthe prototype. Body is submerged, hence there is no waveaction. Reynolds criterion must be satisfied. \rho(water) = 1.94 slugs/ft^3.

Okay, so I've got this fluid mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about dynamic similarity between a prototype and a model. The prototype is a submerged body moving through oil, and the model is being tested in water. The goal is to determine the correct velocity for the model and then predict the drag force on the prototype.

Hmm, I remember that for dynamic similarity, certain dimensionless numbers must be equal between the model and prototype. Since the question mentions the Reynolds criterion, I think that means we're dealing with Reynolds number similarity. Reynolds number is important for situations involving viscous flow, like around submerged objects moving through a fluid.

The model ratio λ is 8:1, meaning the model is 8 times larger than the prototype. Wait no, wait. Wait, model ratio is usually prototype to model. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. Oh, right, model ratio λ is the ratio of prototype dimensions to model dimensions. So if λ is 8:1, then the prototype is 8 times bigger than the model. So L_p = 8 * L_m.

Wait, no, wait again. The problem says it's an enlarged model, so the model is larger than the prototype. So if the model is 8 times larger, then the model ratio λ is 8:1 (model:prototype). Hmm, maybe I should check the exact definition. Oh, wait, some sources define the model ratio as prototype:model, others the opposite. This is a bit confusing. Oh, the question says the model ratio λ is 8:1. So I think that means model size is 8 times the prototype. So each dimension of the model is 8 times that of the prototype.

So for lengths, L_m = 8 L_p.

Now, the prototype is moving at 45 fps in oil. The model is in water, which is 60°F. The oil's properties are given: γ (specific weight) is 52 lb/ft³, μ is 0.0006 lb·s/ft².

Wait, but for dynamic similarity, especially with Reynolds number, we need to match the Reynolds numbers between model and prototype. Reynolds number Re = (V L) / ν, where ν is kinematic viscosity.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the Reynolds criterion must be satisfied. So Re_model = Re_prototype.

So, Re_m = Re_p.

Re_m = V_m * L_m / ν_m

Re_p = V_p * L_p / ν_p

Since Re_m = Re_p,

V_m * L_m / ν_m = V_p * L_p / ν_p

We can solve for V_m:

V_m = V_p * (L_p / L_m) * (ν_m / ν_p)

Wait, because L_p is the prototype length, and L_m is the model length. But since the model is 8 times larger (λ=8:1 model:prototype?), so L_m = 8 L_p. So L_p / L_m = 1/8.

So,

V_m = V_p * (1/8) * (ν_m / ν_p)

Now, we need to find ν for both oil (prototype) and water (model) at their respective temperatures.

Wait, the oil is at some temperature, but the data given is for water at various temperatures. Let me look at the table.

Wait, the problem gives a table for water at different temperatures. The specific weight (gamma), density (rho), viscosity (mu ×1e5), and kinematic viscosity (nu ×1e5) are provided.

Looking at the table:

At 60°F, water has:

gamma = 62.37 lb/ft³.

rho = 1.938 slugs/ft³.

mu = 2.359e-5 lb·s/ft².

nu (kinematic viscosity) is 1.217e-5 ft²/s.

Wait, the oil's properties are given as gamma =52 lb/ft³, mu=0.0006 lb·s/ft².

Wait, but oil's density isn't given directly. Oh, wait, specific weight gamma is given. For oil, gamma is 52 lb/ft³. Since gamma = rho * g, and g is 32.2 ft/s², we can calculate the density of the oil.

rho_oil = gamma / g = 52 / 32.2 ≈ let's compute that. 32.2 * 1.6 is 51.52, so 52 /32.2 ≈ 1.615 slugs/ft³.

Wait, no, wait: gamma is specific weight, which is rho * g. So rho = gamma / g.

Hmm, but wait, in the table for water, for example, at 60°F, gamma is 62.37 lb/ft³, and rho is 1.938 slugs/ft³. Let me check that. So 1.938 slugs/ft³ times 32.2 ft/s² gives approximately 62.37 lb/ft³, which matches. So yes, correct.

So oil's rho is 52 / 32.2 ≈ 1.615 slugs/ft³.

Now, the oil's mu is given as 0.0006 lb·s/ft². So the kinematic viscosity for oil, nu_oil, is mu_oil / rho_oil.

nu_oil = (0.0006 lb·s/ft²) / (1.615 slugs/ft³) → slug is lb·s²/ft, so units should work out.

Wait, lb·s/ft² divided by slugs/ft³ → (lb·s/ft²) * (ft³/slug) → lb·ft/(slug) → slug is lb·s²/ft, so substituting:

( lb·s/ft² ) * ft³/( lb s²/ft )) → ( lb s ft ) / ( lb s² ) ) → ft²/s.

Yes, correct. So nu_oil = 0.0006 / 1.615 ≈ 0.000371 ft²/s.

Wait, let me compute that:

0.0006 / 1.615 = let's see, 0.0006 / 1.615 ≈ 0.0003718 ft²/s.

So, for the oil (prototype), nu_p = 0.0003718 ft²/s.

For the model, which is in 60°F water, nu_m = 1.217e-5 ft²/s, as per the table. Wait, 1.217e-5 is 0.00001217 ft²/s.

Wait, let me double-check the table. At 60°F, the kinematic viscosity is 1.217 ×10^-5 ft²/s. Yep.

So, now, plug into the equation for V_m.

V_m = V_p * (L_p / L_m) * (nu_m / nu_p)

We know V_p is 45 fps.

L_p is prototype length, L_m is model length. Since model is 8:1, L_m = 8 L_p, so L_p/L_m = 1/8.

nu_m = 0.00001217 ft²/s.

nu_p = 0.0003718 ft²/s.

So,

V_m = 45 * (1/8) * (0.00001217 / 0.0003718)

Let me compute the ratio (0.00001217 / 0.0003718) first.

0.00001217 / 0.0003718 = approximately 0.03275.

Because 0.0003718 is about 3.718e-5, and 0.00001217 is 1.217e-5. So 1.217 / 3.718 ≈ 0.3275.

Wait, 1.217 ÷ 3.718 → Let's compute:

3.718 × 0.3275 → 3.718 * 0.3 is 1.1154, 0.0275 *3.718≈0.102 → total ≈1.217.

Yes, so 0.3275.

So, V_m = 45 * (1/8) * 0.3275.

Compute step by step.

45 * (1/8) = 45/8 = 5.625.

Then 5.625 * 0.3275 ≈ let's compute.

5 * 0.3275 = 1.6375.

0.625 * 0.3275: 0.6 * 0.3275=0.1965, 0.025 * 0.3275=0.0081875. Sum is 0.2047.

So total 1.6375 + 0.2047 ≈ 1.8422 fps.

Wait, that's approximately 1.84 fps.

Wait, but looking at the options, none have 1.84. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me recompute.

nu_m = 1.217e-5 ft²/s.

nu_p = 0.0003718 ft²/s.

So, nu_m / nu_p = (1.217e-5) / (3.718e-4) )

Wait, 0.0003718 is 3.718e-4, so 1.217e-5 / 3.718e-4 = (1.217 / 3.718) ) * (1e-5 / 1e-4) ) → (0.3275) * (0.1) → 0.03275.

Wait, yes, that's correct.

So V_m = 45 * (1/8) * 0.03275.

Wait wait, earlier I thought (1/8) times 0.03275.

Wait no, 45*(1/8)=5.625. 5.625 * 0.03275 = ?

Wait, 5 * 0.03275 = 0.16375.

0.625 * 0.03275 = 0.02046875.

Sum: 0.16375 + 0.02046875 ≈ 0.1842 fps.

Hmm, that's about 0.1842 fps. But none of the options match that. The options are like 0.161, 0.213, 0.322, 0.565, etc.

Wait, maybe I messed up the model ratio. Because if the model is 8 times larger, then L_p/L_m is 1/8, which I used. But perhaps I should invert that.

Wait, let's think again. If the model is 8:1 scale, that is, model is 8 times larger than prototype. So the model's length is 8 times that of the prototype. So L_m = 8 L_p → L_p = L_m /8.

Wait, so in the equation for V_m, which is V_p * (L_p / L_m) * (nu_m / nu_p).

So L_p / L_m is (L_m/8) / L_m ) = 1/8.

So that part was correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the nu ratio.

Wait, nu_m is 0.00001217, nu_p is 0.0003718.

So nu_m/nu_p = 0.00001217 / 0.0003718 = approximately 0.03275, as before.

So 45 * (1/8) * 0.03275 = 45 * 0.00409375 ≈ 0.1842 fps.

Hmm, but this isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me check the model ratio again. The model ratio is given as 8:1. What does that mean? If it's model to prototype, then L_m = 8 L_p. So L_p = L_m / 8.

Alternatively, if the model ratio is prototype:model, then lambda is 8:1, so L_p = 8 L_m. But that would make the model smaller than the prototype, which doesn't make sense because the problem says it's an enlarged model. So the model is larger, so model:prototype is 8:1, so L_m =8 L_p.

So the model is 8 times bigger, so L_p/L_m =1/8. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, maybe the model is 1/8th the size, but that would make the model smaller, which doesn't fit. So I think I'm correct with the model being 8 times larger.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the Reynolds number equation is set with the model and prototype scaled, but perhaps I should consider the inverse ratio. Let me think: Re_model = Re_prototype.

So,

(V_m * L_m) / ν_m = (V_p * L_p) / ν_p

So, solving for V_m:

V_m = V_p * (L_p / L_m) * (ν_m / ν_p )

Alternatively, if I write it as V_m = V_p * (L_p / L_m) * (ν_m / ν_p )

Wait, given that L_p = L_m /8, then L_p / L_m = 1/8.

ν_m is 0.00001217, ν_p is 0.0003718.

So, ν_m / ν_p = 0.00001217 / 0.0003718 ≈ 0.03275.

So,

V_m = 45 * (1/8) * 0.03275 ≈ 45 * 0.00409375 = 0.1842 fps.

But none of the options are close to 0.184. Hmm.

Wait, let's look at the options again.

Options are:

A: 0.322 fps, 380 lb

B: 0.161 fps, 580 lb

C: 0.322 fps, 465 lb

D: 0.213 fps, 580 lb

E: 0.565 fps, 380 lb

F: 0.213 fps, 465 lb

G: 0.161 fps, 465 lb

H: 0.565 fps, 465 lb

I: 0.213 fps, 380 lb

J: 0.322 fps, 580 lb.

Hmm, the closest is 0.161 or 0.213. Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, maybe I should compute the ratio more accurately.

Compute nu_m / nu_p.

nu_m = 1.217e-5 ft²/s.

nu_p = 3.718e-4 ft²/s.

So,

1.217e-5 / 3.718e-4 = (1.217 / 3.718) ) * (1e-5 / 1e-4) ) = 0.3275 * 0.1 = 0.03275.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, then V_m = 45 * (1/8) * 0.03275.

Let me compute 45 * (1/8) = 5.625.

Then 5.625 * 0.03275.

Let me compute 5 * 0.03275 = 0.16375.

0.625 * 0.03275 = 0.02046875.

Adding them gives 0.16375 + 0.02046875 = 0.18421875 fps.

Hmm, 0.1842 is approximately 0.184. None of the options match that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating nu_oil.

Wait, oil's mu is 0.0006 lb·s/ft².

Oil's gamma is 52 lb/ft³, so rho_oil = gamma / g = 52 / 32.2 ≈ 1.6152 slugs/ft³.

So, nu_oil = mu / rho = 0.0006 / 1.6152.

Let me compute that: 0.0006 / 1.6152.

1.6152 × 0.0003718 ≈ 0.0006.

Wait, 1.6152 × 0.0003718 = let's calculate:

1.6152 * 0.0003 = 0.00048456.

1.6152 * 0.0000718 = approximately 0.0001158.

Sum ≈ 0.00048456 + 0.0001158 ≈ 0.00060036.

So 1.6152 * 0.0003718 ≈ 0.00060036, which is about 0.0006, so nu_oil ≈ 0.0003718 ft²/s.

Wait, that seems correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should try another approach. Maybe the problem uses the model ratio as prototype to model, so λ=8:1 (prototype:model), meaning model is smaller. But that would contradict the problem statement saying it's an enlarged model.

Wait, perhaps the model ratio is given as model:prototype=1:8. So model is 1/8th the size of the prototype. But that's the opposite of what the problem says, which states it's an enlarged model. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I inverted the ratio somewhere.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should have used the inverse of the model ratio for the velocity. Let me think again.

If the model is 8 times larger, then for Reynolds similarity, velocity scales as the inverse of the length scale times the ratio of kinematic viscosities.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity ratio is (L_p/L_m) * (nu_m/nu_p).

Wait, I think I did that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Compute V_m precisely.

V_m = 45 fps * (1/8) * (1.217e-5 / 3.718e-4 )

Compute 1.217e-5 /3.718e-4:

1.217 / 37.18 = approximately 0.03275.

Because 37.18 * 0.03275 ≈ 1.217.

Wait, 37.18 × 0.03 = 1.1154.

37.18 × 0.00275 = 0.102245.

Sum ≈1.2176. So yes, 0.03275.

So,

V_m = 45 * (1/8) * 0.03275.

Compute 45 * (1/8) = 5.625.

Then 5.625 * 0.03275.

Let me compute 5.625 * 0.03 = 0.16875.

5.625 * 0.00275 = 0.01546875.

Sum: 0.16875 + 0.01546875 = 0.
