Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about linear regression terms, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about dependent and independent variables in regression.

In linear regression, the dependent variable is the one we're trying to predict. It's usually denoted by y. The independent variables are the predictors, denoted by x. Now, the question is about alternative names for the dependent variable.

The question lists four options: (i) The regressand, (ii) The regressor, (iii) The explained variable, (iv) The explanatory variable.

I remember that terms can sometimes be tricky. Let's break them down one by one.

Option (i): Regressand. I think that's another name for the dependent variable. Because in regression analysis, the variable being predicted is called the regressand. So (i) is correct.

Option (ii): Regressor. Hmm, I believe regressors are the independent variables. Like, the variables that do the predicting. So (ii) would be the wrong term for the dependent variable.

Option (iii): Explained variable. That makes sense because the dependent variable is the one being explained by the model. So (iii) is correct.

Option (iv): Explanatory variable. Wait, that sounds like the independent variable. Because it's the variable that explains or predicts the dependent variable. So (iv) is not the dependent variable, it's the independent one.

So looking back, which of the options are correct for the dependent variable? The correct terms are (i) The regressand and (iii) The explained variable. So the question is which options list these two as correct.

Looking at the answer choices:

Option I says (i) and (iii), which matches what I thought. So I think the correct answer is I.

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I got regressor and regressand mixed up. Regressand is the dependent variable, and regressor is the independent. Right, because the regressor does the regression on the regressand. So yes, (i) is correct, (ii) is incorrect.

So the correct options are (i) and (iii). So the right choice should be I.

The dependent variable in linear regression, typically denoted by \( y \), is the variable being predicted or explained. It is referred to by specific terms:

- **(i) The regressand**: This is a correct term for the dependent variable, as it is the variable being predicted in the regression model.
- **(ii) The regressor**: This is incorrect, as regressors refer to the independent variables (\( x \)) that predict the dependent variable.
- **(iii) The explained variable**: This is correct, as the dependent variable is the one being explained by the model.
- **(iv) The explanatory variable**: This is incorrect, as it refers to the independent variable that explains the dependent variable.

Thus, the correct terms for the dependent variable are **(i) The regressand** and **(iii) The explained variable**. Among the answer choices, only **Option I** corresponds to these two terms.

Answer: I
