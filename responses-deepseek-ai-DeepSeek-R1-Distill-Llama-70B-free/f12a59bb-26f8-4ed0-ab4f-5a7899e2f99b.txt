Question:

A shoe retailer allows customers to return shoes within 90 days of purchase. The company estimates that 5% of sales will be returned within the 90-day period.

What amount should the company record as net sales revenue for new sales made during the month?

Options:

A: $195,000
B: $200,000
C: $205,000
D: $220,000
E: $175,000
F: $180,000
G: $185,000
H: $210,000
I: $215,000
J: $190,000

Okay, so I have this accounting problem here about a shoe retailer and their sales returns. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that the company allows customers to return shoes within 90 days, and they estimate that 5% of sales will be returned. So, that means they expect some of their sales to come back as returns. I remember something about revenue recognition and how companies adjust sales for expected returns.

This month, they made sales of $200,000. But wait, there were returns of $5,000 from prior months. So, I think I need to figure out the net sales for this month considering these returns and the expected future returns.

Let me think. Net sales would be the total sales minus any returns and allowances. But since the returns in the current month are from prior sales, maybe I need to adjust for both.

Wait, no, this month's sales are $200k. But during this month, they had returns of $5k from previous months. So, those $5k should be subtracted from the current month's sales because they're returns of prior sales. But also, the company estimates that 5% of current sales will be returned later. So, they need to set aside an allowance for that.

Wait, am I mixing two different things here? There's the returns that happened this month (from prior sales) and the estimated returns from this month's sales.

So, for the current month's net sales:

Total sales = $200,000.

But during the month, they had returns of $5,000 from prior months. So those reduce the sales of prior periods. But for this month's net sales, I think only the current month's activity affects it. Or maybe not. Hmm.

Wait, net sales is calculated as gross sales minus returns and allowances, and any discounts. So, for this month, the gross sales are $200k. Then, the returns that happened this month (which are returns on prior sales) would reduce the prior months' sales, not the current month's. So, for this month's net sales, I don't subtract those $5k because they're related to prior sales.

But wait, the question is about the net sales revenue for the new sales made during the month. So, perhaps the returns that occurred this month (from prior sales) don't affect this month's net sales. So the $5k returns are from previous months, so this month's net sales would not include those.

But also, the company expects 5% of this month's sales to be returned. So, they would need to estimate a returns allowance. So, for sales of $200k, 5% is $10k. So, they would reduce sales by $10k for the expected returns.

Wait, but how does that work? Do they record the sales as $200k, and then set up a contra-revenue account for estimated returns, making net sales $190k ($200k - $10k)?

But the $5k returns from prior months â€” how does that factor in? Because those returns are happening in this month but pertain to prior sales. So, in the current month's income statement, that $5k would reduce the prior sales, not the current ones. So, perhaps when calculating net sales for the current month, I don't subtract the $5k because it's not part of this month's sales.

So, the net sales would be the current sales minus the estimated returns for the current sales. So, $200k minus 5% of $200k, which is $10k. So net sales would be $190k.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is $190k. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to subtract the $5k from the $200k, making $195k, which is option A. But that would be if the $5k is considered part of the net sales adjustment for the current month, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The company made $200k in sales this month. They also had $5k in returns from prior months. So, in terms of this month's net sales, the $5k is a return from a prior period. So, does that mean that the company's net sales for this month would be $200k minus any returns that happened this month related to this month's sales.

But wait, the returns in the current month are for prior sales, so they don't affect the current month's net sales. Instead, they adjust the prior months' sales. So, for this month, the only adjustment to sales would be the estimated returns from this month's sales, which is 5% of $200k = $10k.

So, net sales would be $200k - $10k = $190k. So the correct answer would be option J, $190k.

But wait, another angle: the company's total sales for the month are $200k, but during the same month, they had returns of $5k from prior months. So, the net sales for the month would be $200k (current sales) minus $5k (returns from prior sales) = $195k. But that approach treats the $5k as a deduction from current sales, which might not be accurate because those returns are from past sales.

Alternatively, perhaps the $5k is part of the returns that reduce the prior period's sales, so the current month's net sales are $200k minus the estimated returns on current sales ($10k) = $190k.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me refer to basic accounting principles.

In accounting, when a company sells goods and allows returns, they recognize revenue when it's earned and realizable. So, they record the full sales amount, but also set up an allowance for returns based on estimates. So, for each sale, they debit accounts receivable and credit sales. Then, they estimate the returns and debit sales returns and allowances (a contra-revenue account) and credit the allowance for returns.

So, for this month, they made $200k in sales. So, they'd record $200k as sales. Then, they estimate 5% returns, which is $10k. So, they would reduce sales by $10k, making net sales $190k.

But what about the $5k returns from prior months? Those would adjust the prior months' sales. So, in the current month, when those returns happen, the company would debit sales returns and allowances and credit accounts receivable (or cash if the refund was already given). But this doesn't affect the current month's sales; it's an adjustment to prior sales.

Therefore, when calculating net sales for the current month, those $5k returns are not subtracted because they pertain to prior periods. So, the net sales for the current month would be $200k - $10k estimated returns = $190k.

Looking at the options, that's option J: $190,000.
</think>

The company made $200,000 in sales during the month and estimates that 5% of these sales ($10,000) will be returned within the 90-day period. Therefore, the company should reduce this month's sales by the estimated returns, resulting in net sales of $190,000.

The $5,000 in returns from prior months are related to sales from earlier periods and do not affect the net sales for the current month. These returns would adjust the net sales of the prior periods, not the current month's sales.

Thus, the net sales revenue for the new sales made during the month is $190,000.
