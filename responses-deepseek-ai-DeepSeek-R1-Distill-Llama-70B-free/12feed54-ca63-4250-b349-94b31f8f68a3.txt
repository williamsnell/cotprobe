Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the energy stored in a capacitor over a certain time period. The capacitor's value is 2 farads, and there are three different voltage functions given. For each function, I need to calculate the energy from t=0 to t=10 seconds. The options are A through J, each with three different energies, so I guess each option corresponds to the three parts (a), (b), and (c) respectively.

Wait, the question says "the energy stored in the capacitor from t = 0 to t =10 sec" for each of the given voltage functions. So I'll have to compute this three times, once for each part (a), (b), and (c). Then, I'll match my results to the options given.

But wait, the options list three values per choice, so each option is a triplet for all three parts. So I need to compute all three parts and then see which option matches all three computed values.

The energy stored in a capacitor is given by the formula W = ½ C v(t)^2, but since this is over time, I think I need to integrate this expression over time. Wait no, wait. Wait, the energy stored at any instant is W = ½ C v(t)^2. But if the voltage is changing with time, then the energy is also changing. So the question is, are they asking for the total energy over time, like the integral of power? Or the energy at each instant?

Wait, the question says "the energy stored in the capacitor from t=0 to t=10 sec." Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Because the energy stored at any time t is just W(t) = ½ C v(t)^2. But if they're asking for the total energy over a time period, maybe they mean the integral of power over time. Power is the rate of energy storage, so P = dW/dt. So the total energy delivered to the capacitor would be the integral from 0 to 10 of P(t) dt.

Wait, but energy stored at time t is W(t). So if you want the total energy that went into the capacitor from t=0 to t=10, maybe you need to consider if the voltage is applied and the capacitor is charging or discharging over that time. Alternatively, if the capacitor starts discharged (v=0 at t=0), then the energy at t=10 would be ½ C v(10)^2. But if the voltage is varying, maybe the energy is the integral of power.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The energy stored in the capacitor at any time t is W(t) = ½ C v(t)^2. So if you want the total energy that has been stored over the time interval from 0 to 10 seconds, that's not a standard concept. Alternatively, perhaps the question is just asking for the energy stored at each time t, but averaged over the time? Or maybe it's the integral of the energy over time, which would give you joule-seconds, not joules.

Wait, but the answer options have units in J (joules), so probably each part is looking for the energy at a specific time, but wait the question says "from t=0 to t=10." Hmm, perhaps the question is looking for the total energy delivered to the capacitor over that time. That would mean integrating the power over time, since power is energy per unit time.

Power in the capacitor is the rate of change of energy. So P(t) = dW/dt = C v(t) dv/dt. So the total energy (work done) would be the integral from 0 to T of P(t) dt, which is the integral of C v(t) dv(t). Because dW = C v(t) dv(t), so integrating from v(0) to v(T) gives W_total = ½ C [v(T)^2 - v(0)^2].

Wait, that makes sense. Because the initial energy is ½ C v(0)^2, and the final is ½ C v(T)^2. So the work done is the change in energy, which is ½ C (v(T)^2 - v(0)^2).

But wait, assuming the capacitor starts with zero charge, v(0) would be zero, right? Because the capacitor is initially discharged. So then W_total = ½ C v(T)^2.

Wait, but in this problem, the voltage is given as a function of time, so it's not just a DC voltage. So the capacitor may be charging and discharging over time, but the overall energy change is the final energy minus the initial.

But if the capacitor is connected to a voltage source, I think the approach depends on whether the source is applied over the time. Alternatively, if the voltage is changing as given, and the capacitor is storing and releasing energy as v(t) changes.

Wait, but the problem states the voltage source is connected to the capacitor. So the capacitor will charge and discharge as per the voltage. The total energy stored at any time t is ½ C v(t)^2. So to find the total energy stored from t=0 to t=10, maybe it's the integral of the energy over time. But the options are in J, which is energy, not energy-time. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the maximum energy stored, but that doesn't quite fit the phrasing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the energy stored at t=10 seconds, but that would ignore the time interval. Hmm, the question is a bit ambiguous. But given the presence of time in the functions, I think it's more likely that the energy is the time integral of the instantaneous power, which would give the total energy delivered to the capacitor over that period.

Wait, but let's think about each part.

Let me handle each part one by one.

For each part, given v(t), compute the energy stored as a function of time, and then find the total from t=0 to t=10.

Wait, but perhaps the energy is the time average? No, I think the more correct approach is to compute the integral over time of the power, which is the integral of C v(t) dv(t) from 0 to 10.

Wait, but let's see:

The power delivered to the capacitor at any time t is P(t) = i(t) v(t). But for a capacitor, i(t) = C dv/dt. So P(t) = C v(t) dv(t)/dt. Thus, the energy delivered to the capacitor from t=0 to t=T is the integral of P(t) dt from 0 to T, which is:

W = ∫₀^T C v(t) dv(t) = C ∫₀^T v(t) dv(t) = ½ C [v(T)^2 - v(0)^2]

So if v(0) is zero, then W = ½ C v(T)^2.

Wait, but that's only if the initial voltage is zero. So in that case, the total energy delivered to the capacitor up to time T is ½ C v(T)^2.

But wait, what if v(t) is such that at T=10s, the capacitor is not fully charged, or maybe discharged again? For example, if v(t) is a sine wave, then v(10) might be zero, which would imply that all the energy has been taken out, but that doesn't make sense physically.

Wait, no, because the capacitor stores energy depending on the square of voltage. So if v(t) returns to zero, the stored energy would be zero, but the total energy delivered would involve the sum of all the energy going in and out. So the approach I had earlier, integrating power from 0 to T, would give the net energy, but in the case of periodic functions, this might not account for energy being stored and released.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The problem is to find the energy stored in the capacitor from t=0 to t=10 seconds. So each part (a, b, c) has a v(t), and we need to compute the energy from 0 to 10. So perhaps the question is asking for the total energy delivered to the capacitor, which is the integral over time of the power, i.e., ∫ P(t) dt = ∫ (C v(t) dv(t)/dt) dt from 0 to 10.

Alternatively, if the capacitor starts at zero and is connected to the source, the energy stored at any time is ½ C v(t)^2. So the total energy delivered would be the maximum energy minus the initial, but if the source is varying, that approach might not work.

Wait, but let's look at each part.

Part (a): v(t) = t^2 e^{-2t}

So to find the energy from t=0 to 10, perhaps I need to compute the integral of power, which is ∫₀^{10} C v(t) dv(t)/dt dt.

Alternatively, using the formula W = ½ C (v(10)^2 - v(0)^2).

Since v(0) is zero (because at t=0, v(0)=0^2 e^{-0}=0), so W = ½ C (v(10)^2)

So for (a), let's compute v(10) first.

v(10) = (10)^2 e^{-2*10} = 100 * e^{-20}.

e^{-20} is a very small number. Let me compute its approximate value.

e^20 ≈ 4.85165e8, so e^{-20} ≈ 2.06115e-9.

So v(10) ≈ 100 * 2.06115e-9 = 2.06115e-7 V.

Then, W = ½ * C * v(10)^2.

C is 2 F, so W = 0.5 * 2 * (2.06115e-7)^2 = 1 * (4.25e-14) ≈ 4.25e-14 J.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 6.5e-14, etc.

Option B: 3.6e-14...

Option J: 2.9e-14...

Hmm, my approximate calculation gave around 4.25e-14. But maybe I should calculate more accurately.

Wait, let's compute v(10)^2.

v(t) = t^2 e^{-2t}

v(10) = (10)^2 e^{-20} = 100 e^{-20}

e^{-20} ≈ 2.0611536e-9

So v(10) = 100 * 2.0611536e-9 = 2.0611536e-7 V.

v(10)^2 = (2.0611536e-7)^2 ≈ (2.0611536)^2 * 1e-14.

2.0611536 squared is approx 4.25.

So v^2 ≈ 4.25e-14.

So W = 0.5 * 2 F * 4.25e-14 V² = (1) * 4.25e-14 = 4.25e-14 J.

Now, looking at the options:

Option J's first value is 2.9e-14, which is lower than my calculation.

Option I's first value is 1.43e-13, which is higher.

Option E's first value is 7.7e-14, which is higher than 4.25e-14.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that W is ½ C v(10)^2. Maybe the approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy stored is the integral of the power over the time period, which would be the same as ½ C (v(10)^2 - v(0)^2), but as v(0) is zero, that's ½ C v(10)^2.

But perhaps that's correct, and the options don't have 4.25e-14. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Looking for 4.25e-14 in the first part:

Option J: 2.9e-14.

Option B: 3.6e-14.

Option G:4.3e-14.

Option A:6.5e-14.

Hmm, none of them exactly match 4.25e-14, but perhaps my approximation was too rough.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 100 e^{-20} more accurately.

Wait, e^20 is approximately 485165195.4097, so e^{-20} is 1/485165195.4097 ≈ 2.0611536e-9.

So v(10)=100 * 2.0611536e-9 = 2.0611536e-7 V.

v^2 = (2.0611536e-7)^2 = (2.0611536)^2 * 1e-14.

2.0611536 squared is:

2^2 =4, 0.06115^2≈0.0037, cross term 2*2*0.06115≈0.2446.

So 4 + 0.2446 + 0.0037 ≈4.248.

So v^2 ≈4.248e-14.

Then W = ½ * 2 F * 4.248e-14 = 4.248e-14 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G's first value, which is 4.3e-14. Hmm.

But maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is wrong, and I should instead compute the integral of the power.

Wait, the power is P(t) = C v(t) dv/dt.

So W = ∫ P(t) dt from 0 to 10.

So W = ∫0^10 C v(t) dv(t).

But that's the same as ½ C [v(10)^2 - v(0)^2], which is what I did before.

So perhaps the correct value is around 4.25e-14 J for part (a). But looking at the options, the only one close is option G's (a) value is 4.3e-14. But let's check the other parts to see if this option makes sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the energy stored at each time t, but from t=0 to t=10, so perhaps it's the integral of W(t) from 0 to 10.

That would be ∫0^10 (½ C v(t)^2) dt.

Which would have units of J·s, but the options are in J, so that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the maximum energy stored during that interval, but that also doesn't align with the phrasing.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed to the other parts and see if any pattern emerges.

Part (b): v(t) = t sin t.

So let's compute the same approach: W = ½ C (v(10)^2 - v(0)^2). Since v(0) =0, W=½ * 2 * (10 sin10)^2.

Wait, sin(10 radians) is about... Let's compute sin(10).

10 radians is approximately 573 degrees, which is 573 - 360*1=213 degrees. Sin(213) is sin(180+33)= -sin(33)= approx -0.5446.

But more accurately, 10 radians is about 573.6 degrees.

But let me compute sin(10) using a calculator.

Wait, I'll just approximate it numerically.

Using calculator, sin(10) ≈ -0.5440.

So v(10) =10 * (-0.5440)= -5.440 V.

v(10)^2 = (5.440)^2 ≈29.6 V².

So W=0.5 *2 *29.6= 29.6 J.

Looking at the options, which option's second value is near 29.6?

Option G's second value is 29.5 J.

Option E's second value is 62.8 J.

Option J's second value is33.3 J.

Hmm, option G's (b) value is 29.5, which is close to 29.6.

So for part (b), the energy would be approximately 29.6 J, which matches option G's second value.

Then, part (c): v(t) = sin t e^{-t}.

Again, approach: W = ½ C (v(10)^2 - v(0)^2). But v(0)= sin(0) e^0=0, so W=½ C v(10)^2.

v(10)=sin(10) e^{-10}.

We already have sin(10)≈-0.5440.

e^{-10}≈4.5399e-5.

So v(10)= (-0.5440)(4.5399e-5)≈-2.470e-5 V.

v^2 ≈(2.47e-5)^2≈6.1e-10 V².

W=0.5 *2 *6.1e-10 =6.1e-10 J.

Looking at the options, which option's third value is around 6.1e-10?

Option G's third value is6.09e-10 J.

So that's a match.

So putting it all together:

(a): ~4.25e-14 J.

(b): ~29.6 J.

(c): ~6.1e-10 J.

Looking at the options, option G has (a) 4.3e-14, (b)29.5 J, (c)6.09e-10.

That's very close to my calculations.

So the answer should be option G.

To determine the energy stored in the capacitor for each part of the problem, we use the formula for the energy stored in a capacitor at any time \( t \), which is \( W(t) = \frac{1}{2} C v(t)^2 \). Since the capacitor starts with zero initial voltage (\( v(0) = 0 \)), the total energy delivered to the capacitor from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = 10 \) is given by:

\[
W = \frac{1}{2} C \left[ v(10)^2 - v(0)^2 \right] = \frac{1}{2} C v(10)^2
\]

Here, \( C = 2 \, \text{F} \), and \( v(10) \) is the voltage at \( t = 10 \, \text{s} \). The calculations for each part are as follows:

### Part (a): \( v(t) = t^2 e^{-2t} \)
