Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an isolated spherical conductor with a surface charge density. The question is asking me to find the potential energy in terms of R. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Alright, so first off, the conductor is spherical and isolated, which probably means it's a perfect sphere and not connected to anything else. The charge is on the surface, so it's a surface charge density, sigma. I remember that for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the charge resides entirely on the surface.

The problem gives me that the radius is R and the surface charge density is sigma. They want the potential energy in terms of R. So I need to find an expression for the potential energy U.

Wait, potential energy for a charged conductor... Oh right, the potential energy of a charged conductor is given by U equals (1/2) times the charge times the potential on the surface. Because the work done to bring the charge onto the conductor is stored as potential energy.

So U = (1/2) * Q * V, where V is the electric potential on the surface of the conductor.

Now, the electric potential V on the surface of a charged sphere is k * Q / R, right? Because for a conducting sphere, the potential inside is constant and equal to the surface potential. And k is Coulomb's constant, which is 1/(4πε₀).

So substituting V into the equation, U = (1/2) * Q * (k Q / R) ) = (1/(2)) * (Q² * k ) / R.

But wait, k is 1/(4πε₀), so substituting that in:

U = (1/2) * Q² (1/(4πε₀ R)) ) = Q² / (8 π ε₀ R).

Let me double-check that. Because Q is the total charge on the sphere, which is surface charge density times the surface area. Oh, but wait, the problem gives sigma, so maybe I should express Q in terms of sigma and R.

Right, surface charge density σ is Q divided by the surface area of the sphere. The surface area of a sphere is 4πR². So Q = σ * 4πR².

But wait, in the question, they're asking for the potential energy in terms of R, but the options are given in terms of Q. So perhaps I don't need to substitute Q in terms of sigma and R. Because the answer options have Q in them.

Wait, let me see the options again. Option A is Q²/(16 π ε₀ R), B is 2Q²/(8 π ε₀ R), which simplifies to Q²/(4 π ε₀ R). Option I is Q squared over (8 π ε₀ R).

Hmm, from my calculation, I got U = Q²/(8 π ε₀ R), which matches option I.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. So the formula for potential energy U is (1/2) Q V. The potential V is created by the charge Q on the sphere, so it's (k Q)/R. Substitute k as 1/(4π ε₀), so V = (1/(4π ε₀)) * (Q/R). Then U = (1/2) Q * (Q/(4π ε₀ R)) ) = (Q²) / (8 π ε₀ R). Yeah, that's correct.

So the answer should be option I.

To determine the potential energy \( U \) of an isolated spherical conductor of radius \( R \) carrying a surface charge density \( \sigma \), we start by recalling that the potential energy of a charged conductor is given by:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} Q V,
\]

where \( Q \) is the total charge on the conductor and \( V \) is the electric potential on its surface. For a spherical conductor, the electric potential on the surface is:

\[
V = \frac{k Q}{R},
\]

where \( k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \) is Coulomb's constant. Substituting \( V \) into the expression for \( U \), we get:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} Q \left( \frac{k Q}{R} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{Q^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 R}.
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
U = \frac{Q^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0 R}.
\]

This matches the form of option I. The other options are incorrect because they either have incorrect coefficients or incorrect dependencies on \( R \). For example:

- Option A: \( \frac{Q^2}{16\pi\epsilon_0 R} \) has an incorrect coefficient.
- Option B: \( \frac{2Q^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0 R} \) simplifies to \( \frac{Q^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 R} \), which is incorrect.
- Option J: \( \frac{Q^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 R} \) is also incorrect for the same reason.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I: \( \frac{Q^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0 R} \).**
