Question:

How does the body control the amount of water excreted?

Options:

A: The body controls water excretion through sweat glands.
B: Water excretion is determined by the concentration of electrolytes in the body's cells.
C: The kidneys control water excretion by changing the size of the glomerulus.
D: Water excreted is controlled by the hormone insulin.
E: The body adjusts water excretion by altering the pH level of the blood.
F: Water excretion is regulated by the hormone glucagon.
G: The body controls the amount of water excreted by regulating the permeability of the walls of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts to water, which is controlled by a hormone known as vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH).
H: Water excretion is solely controlled by the rate of respiration.
I: The body controls the amount of water excreted by regulating the heart rate.
J: The body modulates water excretion through the contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscles.

Okay, so I've got this question about how the body controls the amount of water excreted. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that the kidneys play a big role in this. Let me think about the options.

Option A says it's through sweat glands. Well, sweating does contribute to water loss, but I don't think that's the main way the body controls excretion. Plus, the question is probably focusing on a more precise mechanism.

Option B mentions electrolyte concentration. Electrolytes do influence water balance, but I'm not sure if that's the direct control mechanism. It might be more of a factor that triggers other processes.

Option C talks about the kidneys changing the glomerulus size. I remember that the glomerulus is part of the nephron where filtration happens. But adjusting its size would affect the filtration rate, which is more about blood pressure and how much filtrate is formed. But how does that directly control water excretion? Maybe through the amount of urine produced, but I'm not certain if that's the primary method.

Option D says insulin controls it. Insulin is for glucose regulation. I don't think insulin is directly involved in water excretion. Maybe if blood glucose is high, you produce more urine, but that's a side effect, not the main control.

Option E is about pH levels. The body does regulate pH, but I'm not sure how directly that affects water excretion. Maybe through the kidneys, but again, not the main mechanism for water.

Option F is glucagon. That's another hormone related to blood sugar, like insulin. So probably not involved in water excretion directly.

Option G is about the kidneys regulating water by changing the permeability of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts, controlled by ADH. Oh right, ADH stands for antidiuretic hormone. When ADH is released, it makes the kidneys reabsorb more water, reducing urine output. So if ADH is high, you retain more water. That makes sense because when you're dehydrated, ADH increases, so you excrete less water.

Option H says it's controlled by respiration rate. Breathing does expel some water vapor, but I don't think that's the main regulatory mechanism the body uses. It's more of a secondary effect.

Options I and J talk about heart rate and skeletal muscles. Heart rate affects circulation, but not directly how much water is excreted. Skeletal muscles' contraction and relaxation don't seem related to water excretion control.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be G. The kidneys adjust water reabsorption based on ADH levels, which directly controls how much water is excreted as urine.

The body controls the amount of water excreted through the kidneys, specifically by regulating the permeability of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts to water. This process is managed by the hormone vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH). When ADH levels are high, the kidneys reabsorb more water, reducing urine output, which is crucial for maintaining proper hydration levels in the body.

Answer: G
