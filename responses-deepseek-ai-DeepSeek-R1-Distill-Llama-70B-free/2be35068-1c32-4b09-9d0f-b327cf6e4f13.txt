Okay, so I've got this question about Mr. James and his investment options. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that Mr. James is in the 50% income tax bracket. That means he pays half of his income in taxes. He has two choices: buy corporate bonds yielding 8% or municipal bonds yielding 4.5%. I need to decide which is wiser for him.

Wait, I remember that the type of bond affects how the interest is taxed. Corporate bonds are typically subject to federal income tax, right? So the interest he earns from them would be taxable. On the other hand, municipal bonds, also known as munis, are usually tax-exempt. That means the interest is not subject to federal income tax, and sometimes not state or local taxes either, depending on where you live.

So let's break it down. For the corporate bonds, the yield is 8%, but because he's in a 50% tax bracket, he'll lose half of that to taxes. So the after-tax yield would be 8% * (1 - 0.5) = 4%. 

Now, the municipal bonds yield 4.5%, and since they're tax-exempt, he keeps the entire 4.5%. Comparing the two after-tax yields: 4% from corporate vs. 4.5% from municipal. So the municipal bonds give him a slightly better return after taxes.

Wait, but are there any other factors? The options mention things like state tax benefits or potential changes in tax-exempt status. The question doesn't specify any state taxes, so I guess I can ignore that for now. Also, the question asks which is the wiser investment, so considering potential changes might be a factor, but the options don't make that the main point except for option C and H. But in this case, with the information given, the after-tax yield is higher for munis.

So looking at the options, option D is municipal bonds. Option G is corporate bonds. Since 4.5% is better than 4%, Mr. James should go with municipal bonds.

Mr. James is in the 50% income tax bracket, meaning he pays half of his income in taxes. He has two investment options: corporate bonds yielding 8% and municipal bonds yielding 4.5%. Corporate bond interest is taxable, so the after-tax yield would be 8% * (1 - 0.5) = 4%. Municipal bonds, being tax-exempt, yield the full 4.5%. Comparing the two, municipal bonds provide a higher after-tax return of 4.5% versus 4% for corporate bonds. 

The question does not mention state taxes or potential changes in tax-exempt status, so these factors can be ignored. Based on the given information, municipal bonds are the wiser investment.

Answer: D
