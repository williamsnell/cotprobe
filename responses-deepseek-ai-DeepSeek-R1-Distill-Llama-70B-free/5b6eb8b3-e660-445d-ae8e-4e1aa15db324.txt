Okay, so I have this question about car insurance and how much an insurance company will pay after an accident. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

From what I remember, when someone has bodily injury insurance, it usually covers the medical expenses of the people injured in the accident, but there's a limit based on the policy. The question says Frank Lincoln had 5/10 bodily injury insurance. I think that means he has coverage up to $5,000 per person and $10,000 total per accident. So the first number is per person, and the second is the total for all people involved.

In the accident, Frank's car hit John Martin's car. Leon Taylor was a passenger in John's car. So, Leon and John are both injured. Their medical bills are given: Leon has $6,251 and John has $75. Wait, that's a big difference. Leon's bills are way higher than John's.

Now, the insurance company will pay up to the policy limits. For each person, they can pay up to $5,000. But Leon's expenses are $6,251, which is more than $5,000. So the insurance would cover the full $5,000 for Leon. John's bills are only $75, which is well under $5,000, so the insurance would cover all $75 of that.

Adding those up: $5,000 for Leon and $75 for John equals $5,075 total. Wait, but the policy's total per accident is $10,000, so in this case, since $5,075 is less than $10,000, the insurance company should pay the total of $5,075.

Looking at the options, option G is $5,075. So that must be the correct answer. 

I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. The policy is 5/10, so per person up to $5k. Leon hits the cap, John is under. Total is $5k + $75 = $5,075. Yep, that's right.

The question involves determining how much Frank Lincoln's 5/10 bodily injury insurance will pay after an accident. The policy limits are $5,000 per person and $10,000 total per accident. 

Leon Taylor's medical expenses are $6,251, which exceeds the $5,000 per-person limit, so the insurance will cover $5,000 for Leon. John Martin's medical expenses are $75, which is within the $5,000 limit, so the insurance will cover the full $75. 

Adding these amounts gives $5,000 + $75 = $5,075. Since this total is below the $10,000 per-accident limit, the insurance company will pay $5,075.

The correct answer is **G: $5,075**.
