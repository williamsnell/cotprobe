Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a mass-spring system. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that a mass weighing 2 lb stretches a spring 6 inches. Then, the mass is pulled down an additional 3 inches and released. I need to find the position u of the mass at any time t and determine the frequency of the motion.

Wait, right, this is a simple harmonic motion problem. I remember that in these cases, the motion can be described by a differential equation. But first, I think I should find the spring constant and the natural frequency.

Oh wait, the mass is given in pounds, which is a unit of force, not mass. So I need to convert that to mass in slugs because in the English system, weight W = mg, where g is 32 ft/s². Oh right, because F = ma, so W = mg, so m = W/g.

So the mass m is 2 lb divided by 32 ft/s². Let me calculate that. 2 divided by 32 is 1/16 slug. So m = 1/16 slug.

Next, the spring is stretched 6 inches by this mass. Oh, Hooke's law F = kx. The force here is the weight, which is 2 lb. So 2 lb = k * 6 inches. Wait, but I should convert inches to feet because the standard unit here would be in feet. 6 inches is 0.5 feet. So 2 = k * 0.5 → k = 2 / 0.5 = 4 lb/ft.

Wait, that seems right. So the spring constant k is 4 lb/ft.

Now, the natural frequency ω_n is sqrt(k/m). So let's plug in the numbers. k is 4, m is 1/16. So 4 divided by (1/16) is 4 * 16 = 64. So ω_n = sqrt(64) = 8 rad/s. Hmm, okay, that's the natural angular frequency.

Wait, but the question is about the frequency, not the angular frequency. Oh right, the frequency f is ω_n divided by 2π. So f = 8 / (2π) = 4/π Hz. But wait, the options are given in terms of pi over something, so maybe they're asking for the angular frequency? Let me check the question again.

The question says, "determine the position u of the mass at any time t. Find the frequency of the motion." Oh, so frequency as in cycles per second, not angular frequency. So yeah, f = 4/π Hz. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, the units for ω are radians per second. So for frequency, f is in Hz (cycles per second). So 4/π Hz is approximately 1.27 Hz. But looking at the options, they are given in terms like pi/5 s, which I think is the period T, because T is 1/f. Because T would be in seconds.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between frequency and period. Let me think again. The question says "find the frequency of the motion." So that's f, which is 4/π Hz. But looking at the options, each option is given as something like "pi/5 s". Wait, that's a time, which would be period. Oh wait, perhaps the options are not listing frequency but the period? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question states, "find the frequency of the motion." So frequency is f, which is 4/π Hz. But the options are all in terms of pi over something, and with units of seconds. Wait, that can't be right because Hz is 1/s. So the options must be the period, which is T = 1/f = π/(4) seconds. So T is π/4 s. Looking at option D: π/4 s. So perhaps the answer is D.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me go through the steps again.

Mass m: 2 lb weight. So m = 2 / 32 = 1/16 slug.

Spring constant k: F = kx → 2 lb = k * 0.5 ft → k=4 lb/ft.

Natural angular frequency ω_n = sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(4/(1/16)) = sqrt(64) =8 rad/s.

Frequency f = ω_n/(2π) = 8/(2π) =4/π Hz.

Period T = 1/f = π/4 s. So the period is π/4 seconds, which is option D.

So the correct answer is D: π/4 s.

To solve the problem, we start by converting the given weight of the mass into its equivalent mass in slugs. Using the relationship \( W = mg \), where \( g = 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \), the mass is calculated as:

\[
m = \frac{W}{g} = \frac{2}{32} = \frac{1}{16} \, \text{slug}.
\]

Next, we determine the spring constant \( k \) using Hooke's law \( F = kx \). The force \( F \) is the weight of the mass, which is \( 2 \, \text{lb} \), and the displacement \( x \) is \( 6 \, \text{inches} = 0.5 \, \text{ft} \). Solving for \( k \):

\[
k = \frac{F}{x} = \frac{2}{0.5} = 4 \, \text{lb/ft}.
\]

The natural angular frequency \( \omega_n \) is given by:

\[
\omega_n = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{1/16}} = \sqrt{64} = 8 \, \text{rad/s}.
\]

The frequency \( f \) of the motion is related to the angular frequency by \( f = \frac{\omega_n}{2\pi} \). Substituting \( \omega_n = 8 \, \text{rad/s} \):

\[
f = \frac{8}{2\pi} = \frac{4}{\pi} \, \text{Hz}.
\]

The period \( T \), which is the reciprocal of the frequency, is:

\[
T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{\pi}{4} \, \text{s}.
\]

Thus, the frequency of the motion corresponds to a period of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \, \text{s} \), which matches option D.
