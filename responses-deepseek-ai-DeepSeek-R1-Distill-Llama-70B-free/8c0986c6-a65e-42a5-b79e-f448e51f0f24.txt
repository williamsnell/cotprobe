Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the energy of one mole of UV photons with a wavelength of 300 nm and then comparing it to a typical single-bond energy. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the energy of a photon is given by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. But wait, that's for a single photon, right? Since the question is about a mole of photons, I'll need to multiply by Avogadro's number to get the energy per mole.

So, breaking it down step by step. The wavelength given is 300 nm. Oh wait, nanometers are 1e-9 meters. So λ = 300e-9 m. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

Calculating the energy for a single photon: E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (300e-9 m). Let me compute that. The numerator is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Dividing by 300e-9 m gives 1.9878e-25 / 300e-9 = 6.626e-19 J per photon.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 3e8 divided by 300e-9 is 1e17? No, wait, 3e8 divided by 300e-9 is (3e8)/(3e-7) because 300e-9 is 3e-7. Oh wait, 300e-9 is 3e-7 meters. So 3e8 / 3e-7 = 1e15. So 6.626e-34 * 1e15 is 6.626e-19 J. Yeah, that matches.

Now, per mole of photons. Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 mol^-1. So per mole, energy E = 6.626e-19 J/photon * 6.022e23 photons/mol. Let's calculate that: 6.626e-19 * 6.022e23 = (6.626 * 6.022) * 1e4. 6.626 times 6 is about 39.756, plus 0.022*6.626 is about 0.145, so roughly 39.9. So 39.9e4 J/mol.

Wait, 39.9e4 J is 399,000 J/mol, which is 399 kJ/mol. Oh, because 1 kJ is 1e3 J. So 399,000 J is 399 kJ/mol. Hmm.

Looking at the options, option H is 399 kJ/mol. But wait, the question also says to compare it with a typical single-bond energy of 400 kJ/mol. So the energy is just about equal, which makes sense. So the answer should be the one closest to 400, which is option H.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I missed a factor somewhere. Let me recalculate E for one photon.

E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (300e-9). Let's compute numerator: 6.626 *3 = 19.878, so 19.878e-26 J·m. Dividing by 300e-9 m: 19.878e-26 / 300e-9 = (19.878 / 300) * 1e-17. 19.878 /300 is about 0.06626. So 0.06626e-17 J? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = (6.626 *3) * 1e-34+8 = 19.878 * 1e-26 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Dividing by 300e-9 m is 1.9878e-25 / 3e-7 = (1.9878 /3) * 1e-18 = approx 0.6626 * 1e-18 = 6.626e-19 J. Oh, same as before. So that's correct.

Then per mole: 6.626e-19 J/photon * 6.022e23 photons/mol = (6.626 *6.022) * 1e4 (since 1e-19 *1e23 =1e4). 6.626 *6.022 is roughly 39.9, so 39.9e4 J/mol is 399 kJ/mol. So the calculation checks out.

So the energy is about 399 kJ/mol, which is just under 400, matching the single-bond energy given. So the correct answer should be option H: 399 kJ/mol.

To calculate the energy of one mole of UV photons with a wavelength of \( 300 \, \mathrm{nm} \), we use the formula for the energy of a photon:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 300 \, \mathrm{nm} = 300 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{m} \) (wavelength).

Substituting the values:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{300 \times 10^{-9}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{3 \times 10^{-7}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J}
\]

This is the energy of a single photon. To find the energy for one mole of photons, we multiply by Avogadro's number (\( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1} \)):

\[
E_{\text{molar}} = E_{\text{photon}} \cdot N_A = (6.626 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (6.022 \times 10^{23}) = 3.99 \times 10^5 \, \mathrm{J/mol} = 399 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
\]

Thus, the energy of one mole of UV photons with a wavelength of \( 300 \, \mathrm{nm} \) is approximately \( 399 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol} \), which is very close to the typical single-bond energy of \( 400 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol} \).

From the given options, the closest match is:

**H: 399 kJ/mol**
