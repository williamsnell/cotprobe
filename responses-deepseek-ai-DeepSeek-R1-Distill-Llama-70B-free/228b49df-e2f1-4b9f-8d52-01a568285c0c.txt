Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I walk alongside the column, ask what's going on.
A soldier says simply: "They call up more every day.
"Some of us were sent north to the Yellow River at age fifteen,
And now at forty we're heading off to the garrisons in the west.
On our first tour, the village headman had to tie our bandannas for us.
When we came back, our hair was white, but still there's more unrest.
The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,
But the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions have yet to crest.
In the hundred districts east of the mountains, throughout the land of Han,
There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest.
Even if wives are strong enough to handle a hoe and plow,
The crops grow every which way, the fields are all a mess.
It's hardest for the Shanxi men, with their reputations as fighters:
They're rounded up like dogs or chickens, every male impressed.
"But sir, though it's good of you to ask,
Complaining isn't part of the soldier's task.
We can only shake our heads. Take this winter:
The Shanxi troops were never sent home.
The District Officers are demanding the land tax,
But where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!
I honestly think it's bad luck to bear a son now,
It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry
And live with the neighbors next door.
But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie."
Du Fu, "Ballad of the Army Carts," ca. 750 C.E.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Tang Dynasty relations with western nomadic and frontier peoples, based on a poem by Du Fu. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Tang Dynasty was a period of significant interaction with various nomadic groups. They had a mix of strategies to deal with these peoples, including military actions, diplomacy, and tributary systems.

Looking at the poem, it describes soldiers being recruited and sent to various frontiers, like the Yellow River and the western garrisons. It talks about the hardships of the soldiers and the impact on their families. The poem mentions that the frontier garrisons are filled with blood, which suggests ongoing military conflicts. Also, the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions imply that military expansion and control were part of the strategy.

The question is asking about what the Tang relied on in their relations. The options include things like spies, diplomacy, tribute, relocation, economic incentives, peace treaties, cultural dissemination, settlements, and military power.

Option I says it's the ability to project military power to impose the emperor's will. That seems to fit because the poem talks about soldiers being sent out, garrisons, and ongoing unrest. The Tang were known for their military campaigns against nomads like the Turks and others.

Other options: Option B mentions diplomacy and client relationships. I think the Tang did use some diplomacy, like forming alliances or client states where some nomadic leaders acknowledged Tang authority. Option C is about paying tribute, which was more common in earlier dynasties like the Han, where they paid off the Xiongnu. The Tang might have done this too, but the poem doesn't directly mention it. 

Option E talks about economic incentives. That could relate to trade or payments, but again, the poem doesn't highlight that. Option I seems more directly supported by the poem's focus on military campaigns and garrisons.

So putting it all together, the Tang's relations relied on military power and the ability to project it on the frontier to maintain control and expand their territory. The poem's imagery of soldiers and garrisons supports this.

The Tang Dynasty's relations with western nomadic and frontier peoples, as reflected in Du Fu's poem, emphasize the role of military power. The poem describes soldiers being conscripted at a young age, sent to distant garrisons, and facing endless unrest, highlighting the Tang's reliance on military might to maintain control and expand their territory. While the Tang also employed diplomacy and cultural strategies, the poem's focus on military campaigns and garrisons underscores the importance of projecting military power.

Answer: I
