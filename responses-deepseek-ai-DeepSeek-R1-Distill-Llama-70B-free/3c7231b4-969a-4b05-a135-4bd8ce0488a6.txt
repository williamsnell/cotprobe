Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the endosymbiotic theory. Hmm, I remember that the endosymbiotic theory explains how certain organelles in eukaryotic cells originated. The question is asking which option does NOT support the theory that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once independent prokaryotes.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Mitochondria and chloroplasts divide independently by binary fission. Binary fission is how prokaryotes reproduce, right? So if these organelles divide that way, it supports the idea they came from bacteria. So A supports the theory, so it's not the exception.

Option B: They have ribosomes similar to bacteria. Oh yeah, I remember that the ribosomes in mitochondria and chloroplasts are more like bacterial ones, which supports the theory. So B is a supporting point, not the exception.

Option C: They function independently from the host. Wait, function independently? I'm not so sure. I think mitochondria and chloroplasts do rely on the host cell for some things. For example, they can't make all their proteins by themselves—some are provided by the host. If they functioned completely independently, that might not support the theory. Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, the theory says they were once independent, so the fact that they still function somewhat on their own (like having their own DNA and replication) supports it. Hmm, maybe C is the exception. Not sure yet.

Option D: They have circular chromosomes without histones. Bacteria have circular DNA and lack histones, which are proteins around which eukaryotic DNA winds. So mitochondria and chloroplasts having this feature definitely supports the theory. So D is a supporting point, not the exception.

Wait, the question is which option does NOT support the theory. So looking again. The theory is that these organelles were once free-living prokaryotes. So any feature that suggests they have their own structures or functions similar to prokaryotes supports the theory.

Option C says they function independently. If they function independently, that would mean they don't rely on the host, which could support the idea that they were once independent. But wait, in reality, do they function completely independently? No, because they do depend on the host for various things. So if option C is saying they function independently, maybe that's not entirely true and doesn't support the theory. Or perhaps the fact that they have some independence supports the theory.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about what each option implies.

The endosymbiotic theory says that mitochondria and chloroplasts originated from engulfed prokaryotes. So evidence supporting this includes having their own DNA, ribosomes, binary fission-like division, etc.

So, option C says they function independently. If they functioned completely on their own, that might suggest they don't need the host, which would support the theory. But in reality, while they have some autonomy, they are not entirely independent. So if option C is stating that they function independently, maybe it's an overstatement and not accurate. Or perhaps the theory is about their origin, not necessarily about their current level of independence.

Wait, the theory predicts that because they were once independent, they would have certain features. So the fact that they have their own DNA, reproduce by binary fission, etc., supports it. But option C is about functioning independently. If they function independently, that's more about their current state rather than evidence of their origin.

Hmm, maybe the exception is option C because the theory doesn't necessarily say they function independently now. They could have structures that allow them to function somewhat independently, but that's not the same as functioning completely independently. Alternatively, maybe option C is correct because if they functioned independently, that would contradict the theory because they are now organelles within a eukaryotic cell.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to remember the evidence points. The evidence includes: having own DNA, ribosomes, binary fission, and the structure of their chromosomes. So any option that states something that doesn't fit with these would be the exception.

Option C says they function independently. But I think that's not true. They can't function entirely on their own. For example, many of their proteins are coded by the host nucleus. So if they can't function independently, then saying they function independently would be incorrect and thus not support the theory. Wait, but the question is which option does NOT support the theory. So if option C is a false statement, then it wouldn't support the theory.

Wait, I'm getting myself turned around. Let me approach it differently. The theory is that they were once independent. So all these options should be evidence for that.

Option A: They divide on their own. That's a prokaryotic trait—supports theory.

Option B: Ribosomes like bacteria—supports.

Option C: Function independently. If they do, that's a trait of being independent, which supports.

Option D: Circular chromosomes like bacteria—supports.

Wait, but I thought that mitochondria and chloroplasts are not entirely independent now. They rely on the host for various functions. So statement C might be incorrect, meaning that it does not support the theory. Because if they don't function independently, then that's not evidence for the theory.

Alternatively, if the statement is that they function independently, but in reality they don't, then that would not support the theory, making it the exception.

So in the question, the options are about evidence that supports the theory. So if option C is not a true statement, then it doesn't support the theory.

Wait, so the question is which option does NOT support the theory.

So which option is NOT evidence for the theory? Because the other options are evidence, and the incorrect one is the exception.

So if option C says they function independently, but in reality, they don't, then option C is incorrect as a statement. Therefore, it would not support the theory, making it the exception.

Alternatively, if option C is a correct statement (which I'm not certain about), then it would support the theory.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each point.

The endosymbiotic theory is supported by several lines of evidence:

1. Mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA, which is circular and without histones, similar to prokaryotes. (So D is correct, supports.)

2. They have their own ribosomes, which are more like bacterial ribosomes. (So B supports.)

3. They reproduce by binary fission, a prokaryotic method. (So A supports.)

4. They are able to carry out some metabolic processes independently, such as producing some of their own proteins, but they are not entirely independent. So option C says they function independently. If they are not entirely independent, then option C is not accurate, so it doesn't support the theory.

Wait, but the theory doesn't require that they function independently now. It just explains their origin. So maybe the fact that they have some independence in function (like having their own DNA for some functions) supports the theory. So option C's correctness depends on whether they can function without the host.

Alternatively, if the statement in C is that they function independently, but in reality, they can't, then C is incorrect and thus does not support the theory.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is C because their functioning is not entirely independent. So option C does not support the theory.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall from what I've studied. Do mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently?

They do have their own DNA and can perform some functions, but they also rely on the host cell for many things. For example, most of their proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA. So their functioning isn't entirely independent.

So if option C is stating that they function independently, that's not true. So option C is incorrect and thus does not support the theory, making it the exception.

The endosymbiotic theory explains that mitochondria and chloroplasts originated from free-living prokaryotes. The question asks which option does NOT support this theory. Let’s analyze each option:

- **Option A**: Mitochondria and chloroplasts divide independently by binary fission, a method used by prokaryotes. This supports the theory, as it aligns with their prokaryotic origin.

- **Option B**: They have ribosomes similar to bacteria, which supports the theory since bacterial-like ribosomes are a key feature of their prokaryotic ancestry.

- **Option C**: This states that mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently from the host cell. However, this is not entirely true. While they have some autonomy (e.g., their own DNA and metabolic processes), they rely on the host cell for many functions, such as obtaining materials and proteins encoded by nuclear DNA. Since they are not fully independent, this statement does not accurately support the theory.

- **Option D**: Mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria all have single, circular chromosomes without histones, which is a prokaryotic characteristic. This supports the theory.

The exception is **Option C**, as it inaccurately claims that mitochondria and chloroplasts function independently, which contradicts the reality of their partial dependence on the host cell. This makes it the correct answer.

Answer: C
