Okay, so I've got this question about fractional reserve banking, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what fractional reserve banking means. From what I remember, it's a system where banks keep a fraction of their deposits as reserves and lend out the rest. This is different from full reserve banking where banks keep all deposits as reserves and don't lend any.

So the question is asking which option correctly describes fractional reserve banking. Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A says the central bank holds a certain fraction of the bank's deposits on reserve at all times. Hmm, wait. I think the reserves are usually held by the commercial banks themselves, not the central bank. Or maybe the central bank requires the commercial banks to hold a fraction of their deposits as reserves. So A might be mixing up who holds the reserves. I'm not sure yet.

Option B states a bank cannot lend out all of its deposits. That makes sense because if they kept all deposits as reserves, they wouldn't be able to lend. So fractional reserve means they can lend some, but not all. So B seems correct, but let's check the others.

Option C says the bank must hold a certain percentage of deposits in reserve. Yes, that sounds familiar. Banks are required to maintain a reserve requirement, which is a percentage of their deposits. So C looks correct as well. Now I'm confused between B and C.

Wait, but what's the exact definition. Fractional reserve banking allows banks to lend out a fraction of their deposits, keeping only a fraction as reserves. So the bank must hold a certain percentage in reserve. That would be option C. But option B is also a true statement because they can't lend all, but maybe C is more precise.

Option D mentions the central bank holding a fraction of GDP. That doesn't sound right. GDP is a broad measure, and I don't think the central bank's reserves are tied directly to GDP in that way.

Option E talks about the central bank setting loan interest rates. That's more about monetary policy and doesn't directly relate to fractional reserves. The question is about what the system means, not the central bank's rate-setting.

Option F says banks can lend all deposits but must maintain reserves. Wait, that can't be right. If they can lend all deposits, then their reserves would be zero, which contradicts fractional reserve. So F is incorrect.

Option G claims all loans must be backed by equivalent reserves. That would mean 100% reserve, which is the opposite of fractional. So G is wrong.

Option H limits loan size to 20% of holdings. I don't think that's part of fractional reserve banking. It might be some other regulation, but not directly related to the fractional reserve system.

Option I says banks can only lend a fixed percentage of deposits. That sounds similar to C, but I think the fixed percentage is the reserve requirement. So if the reserve is, say, 10%, then the bank can lend 90%. So I isn't the best answer because it's the percentage they can't lend, not the percentage they can lend.

Option J is about central bank auditing, which is a regulatory measure but not directly explaining fractional reserves.

So, narrowing it down, both B and C seem correct. Option B says banks can't lend all deposits, which is true because they keep some as reserves. Option C says they must hold a certain percentage as reserves, which is also true. Wait, the question is about what the system means. So fractional reserve banking implies that banks hold a fraction (a percentage) in reserve, allowing them to lend the rest. So the correct answer would be C because it directly addresses the reserve requirement. But wait, another thought: the option could also be B because it's a consequence of C. Which one is more accurate as the definition.

In economics, fractional reserve banking is defined by the requirement that banks hold a certain percentage of deposits as reserves, which allows them to lend the remaining fraction. So the system's definition involves the reserve requirement, making option C correct. But wait, the way the options are phrased, perhaps C is correct.

Wait, looking back at option B, "a bank cannot lend out all of its deposits" is a true statement under fractional reserve banking, but it's a result of the reserve requirement. Option C states the reserve requirement, which is the essence of the system. So the question is asking what the system means, so the definition would point to the reserve requirement. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

But wait, another angle: fractional reserve banking allows banks to lend out a fraction, which inherently means they can't lend all. So both B and C are correct statements, but which one is the best answer.

Wait, looking again: the question is about what having a fractional reserve system means. So it's about the mechanism. The reserve requirement is the key here. So C is more directly the definition.

Alternatively, sometimes the fractional reserve system is described by the fact that banks can only lend a fraction, which is option B. Hmm, I'm a bit torn, but I think C is the more precise answer because it's about the reserve requirement.

Wait, but another thought: the reserve requirement is a regulation imposed by the central bank. So the system is based on banks keeping a certain percentage as reserves, which is option C. So I'd go with C.

Fractional reserve banking is a system in which banks hold a fraction of their deposits as reserves and lend out the remaining amount. This is distinct from full reserve banking, where banks hold 100% of deposits as reserves and do not lend. The question asks which option best describes the meaning of fractional reserve banking.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. While the central bank may require commercial banks to hold reserves, it is the commercial banks themselves that hold the reserves, not the central bank holding a fraction of the bank's deposits.
- **Option B**: True but not the most precise. It correctly states that banks cannot lend out all their deposits, but this is a consequence of the reserve requirement, not the definition of the system itself.
- **Option C**: Correct. This directly addresses the core of fractional reserve banking, which is that banks must hold a certain percentage of their deposits in reserve, allowing them to lend the rest. This is the defining feature of the system.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The central bank does not hold a fraction of GDP on reserve; this is unrelated to fractional reserve banking.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. This pertains to monetary policy and interest rates, not the mechanism of fractional reserve banking.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Banks cannot lend out all their deposits under fractional reserve banking, as they must maintain reserves.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. This describes full reserve banking, where all loans must be backed by equivalent reserves, which is the opposite of fractional reserve banking.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. This refers to a specific regulation on loan size, not fractional reserve banking.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. While banks can only lend a fixed percentage of their deposits, this is a consequence of the reserve requirement, not the definition of the system.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Auditing is a regulatory measure and does not define fractional reserve banking.

The most accurate and direct description of fractional reserve banking is that banks must hold a certain percentage of their deposits in reserve at all times, as stated in **Option C**.

Answer: C
