Question:

A teachers union, a nongovernmental entity, seeks to picket the local city school board for its decision to require higher certification for instructors who wish to teach in the gifted and talented classes in elementary school. After a few days of picketing, the school board seeks a temporary injunction in the state court to restrain further picketing of the school board. The school board insists that the teachers union has violated Section 101 of the city's picketing ordinance. Section 101 reads as follows:"Section 101. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to public elementary and secondary schools without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. "The court will most likely

Options:

A: deny relief, because the ordinance does not clearly define what constitutes as "immediately adjacent or contiguous."
B: deny relief, because the teachers union has the right to peaceful protest.
C: deny relief, because the picketing ordinancewas unconstitutional on its face.
D: grant relief, because the ordinance isconstitutional.
E: grant relief, because the ordinance is necessary for the maintenance of peace and order around schools.
F: grant relief, because the picketing disrupted the operation of the school.
G: deny relief, because the ordinance does notprovide procedural due process.
H: deny relief, because the ordinance infringes on the union's right to freedom of speech.
I: grant relief, because the teachers union did not receive permission from the mayor.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

Alright, the situation is that a teachers union is picketing the local city school board. The school board wants to stop them with a temporary injunction, claiming the union violated Section 101 of the city's picketing ordinance. I need to determine how the court would likely rule.

First, I should understand what the ordinance says. Section 101 prohibits picketing inside or on sidewalks/streets adjacent to public elementary and secondary schools without the mayor's permission. Applications must be filed three days in advance, stating the purpose, place, and time.

So the key points are:
- Picketing near schools without permission is prohibited.
- Permission requires advance application with details.

The teachers union is picketing without permission, as far as I can tell from the question. They've been picketing for a few days, and the school board is seeking an injunction based on this ordinance.

Now, the issue is whether the court will grant the injunction. The options suggest various reasons, mostly revolving around the constitutionality of the ordinance and the rights of the union.

I remember that the First Amendment protects peaceful picketing as a form of free speech, but it's not absolute. Governments can impose reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. So the question is whether this ordinance is a valid restriction.

Looking at the ordinance, it requires permission from the mayor to picket near schools. That sounds like a prior restraint. Prior restraints are generally disfavored and subject to strict scrutiny. They must be necessary to serve a compelling government interest and be the least restrictive means.

The ordinance's purpose seems to be about maintaining order around schools, which is a legitimate government interest. But does requiring permission from the mayor violate free speech? The Supreme Court has dealt with similar issues. For example, in cases where a permit is required for public gatherings, the Court has emphasized that such systems must be content-neutral and not give too much discretion to the officials.

In this case, the ordinance says applications must be filed three days in advance and state the purpose, place, and time. But does it give the mayor too much discretion? If the mayor can deny permission for any reason, that might be a problem because it could lead to censorship based on the content of the picketing.

Wait, the ordinance doesn't specify criteria for the mayor to grant or deny permission. It just says "express permission of the mayor." That could mean the mayor has unfettered discretion, which could be unconstitutional because it allows for arbitrary denial based on the message.

Another point is whether the ordinance is a complete ban or just a regulation. Here, it's not a ban; you can picket if you get permission. But the lack of clear standards might make it unconstitutional as a prior restraint.

So, if the court finds that the ordinance gives too much discretion to the mayor without clear guidelines, it could be deemed unconstitutional. Alternatively, if the ordinance is seen as a reasonable regulation with appropriate safeguards, it might be upheld.

Looking at the options, option C says the court will deny relief because the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. Option H says the court will deny relief because the ordinance infringes on free speech. Option I says they'll grant relief because the union didn't get permission.

But wait, even if the ordinance is found unconstitutional, the court wouldn't grant the injunction. So if the court deems the ordinance invalid, the school board can't enforce it, and the union can continue picketing. So options C, H, etc., would lead to denying the injunction.

Alternatively, if the court thinks the ordinance is constitutional, they might grant the injunction. But I think the ordinance's issue is the prior restraint without sufficient safeguards.

So the likely answer is that the court denies relief because the ordinance is unconstitutional, perhaps on its face, or because it infringes on free speech without proper justification.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. Option H says it infringes on free speech. Both could be correct, but what's the precise reasoning.

In the case of prior restraints, if the law doesn't have procedural safeguards like prompt judicial review, it might be facially invalid. So the ordinance here requires permission but doesn't outline any appeal process or criteria, making it vulnerable to a facial challenge.

Therefore, the court would likely deny relief, holding the ordinance unconstitutional on its face because it's an unconstitutional prior restraint without necessary safeguards.

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me check other options. Option I says grant relief because they didn't get permission. But if the ordinance is unconstitutional, then not getting permission isn't a valid reason to grant the injunction. So the court wouldn't grant it based on an invalid law.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
</think>

The court is likely to deny relief because the picketing ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. The ordinance constitutes a prior restraint on free speech, requiring permission from the mayor without providing clear criteria or procedural safeguards. Such a lack of standards allows for potential arbitrary enforcement, violating First Amendment protections. Since the ordinance does not meet constitutional standards, the court would not grant the injunction.
