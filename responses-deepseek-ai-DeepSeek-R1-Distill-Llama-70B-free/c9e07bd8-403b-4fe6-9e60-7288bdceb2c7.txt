Okay, so I've got this math problem here: "What percent is 131 of 42?" Hmm, right. I think I remember that to find what percent one number is of another, you divide the first by the second and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. Let me think about that again. Oh wait, the formula is (part/whole) * 100%. So in this case, the part is 131 and the whole is 42.

Wait, but sometimes I get confused about which number comes first. Oh right, the question is phrased as "131 of 42", which I think translates to 131 divided by 42. So yeah, I should do 131 divided by 42 first.

Let me try that division. 42 goes into 131 how many times? Well, 42 times 3 is 126, which is less than 131. 42 times 4 is 168, which is too big. So 3 times with a remainder. 131 minus 126 is 5. So it's 3 and 5/42. Now I need to convert that into a decimal.

5 divided by 42. Let me calculate that. 42 into 5.000. 42 goes into 50 once (1*42=42), subtract 42 from 50, you get 8. Bring down the next 0, making it 80. 42 goes into 80 once again (1*42=42), subtract 42 from 80, which leaves 38. Bring down the next 0, making it 380. 42 goes into 380 nine times because 9*42 is 378. Subtracting gives 2. Bring down another 0, making it 20. 42 goes into 20 zero times, so maybe I should stop here or see if there's a repeating pattern.

Wait, so so far, the decimal is 3.119... because 5/42 is approximately 0.119. So putting it all together, 131 divided by 42 is approximately 3.119.

Now, to get the percentage, I multiply by 100, so 3.119 * 100 equals 311.9%. Let me double-check that math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 131 divided by 42 is about 3.119... and that times 100 is 311.9%.

Looking at the options, option J is 311.9%, which matches my calculation. So the correct answer should be J.

To determine what percent 131 is of 42, use the formula for percentage: (part/whole) Ã— 100%. Here, the part is 131 and the whole is 42. 

1. Divide 131 by 42:  
   \( \frac{131}{42} \approx 3.119 \).  

2. Multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:  
   \( 3.119 \times 100 = 311.9\% \).  

Thus, 131 is approximately 311.9% of 42. The correct answer is **J: 311.9%**.
