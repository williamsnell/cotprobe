Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the vapor pressure of water using the gas saturation method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a vapor when it's in equilibrium with its liquid or solid phase. The gas saturation method probably involves passing a gas through water and measuring the amount of water vapor that the gas picks up. 

The problem says that 100 liters of N2 gas is passed through 65.44 grams of water. After that, 63.13 grams remain. The temperature is 25°C. We need to find the vapor pressure of water at this temperature. 

Wait, so the vapor pressure of water at 25°C is a known value, isn't it? I think it's around 23-24 mmHg. But maybe I should calculate it using the given data instead of relying on memory.

So, let's see. The initial mass of water is 65.44 grams, and after the gas passes through, 63.13 grams remain. That means the gas picked up some water vapor. The mass lost is 65.44 - 63.13 = 2.31 grams. So, 2.31 grams of water vaporized and were carried away by the nitrogen gas.

Now, I need to find out how many moles of water that is. The molar mass of water is about 18.015 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass = 2.31 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 0.128 moles of H2O.

Wait, but wait. The volume of N2 is 100 liters. At 25°C, what's the pressure? The problem doesn't specify, so I think we assume it's at standard atmospheric pressure, which is 1 atm or 760 mmHg. But wait, the collected vapor is in the gas phase, so maybe ideal gas law applies here.

So, the vapor pressure of water is the partial pressure of water vapor in the nitrogen gas. The total pressure is atmospheric pressure, but since N2 is inert and doesn't react, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of N2 and H2O. But wait, when you pass N2 through water, the N2 doesn't dissolve much, so the pressure of N2 is almost the same as atmospheric, and the water vapor adds its pressure.

Wait, maybe I should model this as a situation where the total pressure is atmospheric (since the system is open), so the partial pressure of water is the vapor pressure.

But let me think again. The setup is that the N2 is passed through water, and some of it becomes saturated with water vapor. The total moles of N2 plus the moles of H2O would relate to the pressure. But I think another approach is to use the ideal gas law for the water vapor.

Wait, the amount of water vapor is 0.128 moles. The volume is 100 liters, but wait, does the volume include the N2? So the total volume is 100 L, but the partial volume of water vapor would be (nRT)/P. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should model the situation where the 100 L of N2 gas at 25°C and 1 atm is carrying the water vapor. So the water vapor has a partial pressure which is the vapor pressure we're trying to find.

Alternatively, let me think about it this way: when the N2 gas (100 L) passes through the water, it picks up some water vapor. The mass of water vapor is 2.31 grams, which is 2.31 / 18.015 ≈ 0.128 moles. So the moles of H2O in the gas phase is 0.128.

Using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT.

We need to find P, the partial pressure of H2O. The temperature is 25°C, which is 298 K (25 + 273). The volume is 100 L, which is 100,000 mL or 0.1 m³. Wait, no, 100 L is 100,000 mL? No, wait, 1 L is 1000 mL, so 100 L is 100,000 mL. But in terms of cubic meters, it's 0.1 m³.

But using the ideal gas law in terms of units that make sense. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when pressure is in atm, volume in liters.

So, P = nRT / V.

n is 0.128 moles.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

T is 298 K.

V is 100 L.

So, substituting:

P = (0.128 mol) * (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * (298 K) / (100 L)

Calculating numerator: 0.128 * 0.0821 * 298.

Let me compute that step by step.

0.128 * 0.0821 = approx 0.01051.

0.01051 * 298 ≈ 3.13.

Then, divide by 100 L: 3.13 / 100 = 0.0313 atm.

Convert that to mmHg because the options are in mm. Since 1 atm = 760 mmHg, 0.0313 atm * 760 mmHg/atm = approx 23.8 mmHg.

Wait, but one of the options is F:23.8 mm. Hmm. But wait, I thought the vapor pressure of water at 25°C is about 23.8 mmHg, so that would make sense. So the answer should be option F.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Let me recompute the calculation:

n = 2.31 g / 18.015 g/mol = let me calculate that.

2.31 / 18.015.

18.015 * 0.128 is roughly 2.31 (18*0.128 is 2.304), so yes, approx 0.128 moles.

P = (0.128) * (0.0821) * (298) / (100) in atm.

So 0.128 * 0.0821 = 0.0105088.

0.0105088 * 298 = let me compute 0.01 * 298 = 2.98, 0.0005088 * 298 ≈ 0.1516. So total is about 3.1316.

3.1316 divided by 100 is 0.031316 atm.

0.031316 atm * 760 mmHg/atm = 23.8 mmHg.

Yes, that's correct. So the vapor pressure is 23.8 mmHg, which is option F.

To determine the vapor pressure of water at 25°C using the gas saturation method, the following steps were taken:

1. **Mass of Water Vaporized**:  
   The initial mass of water was 65.44 g, and after passing 100 L of N₂ gas, 63.13 g remained. The mass of water vaporized is:  
   \[
   65.44 \, \text{g} - 63.13 \, \text{g} = 2.31 \, \text{g}.
   \]

2. **Moles of Water Vapor**:  
   The molar mass of water is \( 18.015 \, \text{g/mol} \). The number of moles of water vaporized is:  
   \[
   n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{2.31 \, \text{g}}{18.015 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.128 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Ideal Gas Law**:  
   The vapor pressure of water is calculated using the ideal gas law:  
   \[
   P = \frac{nRT}{V}.
   \]  
   Here:  
   - \( n = 0.128 \, \text{mol} \),  
   - \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \),  
   - \( T = 25^\circ \text{C} = 298 \, \text{K} \),  
   - \( V = 100 \, \text{L} \).  

   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   P = \frac{(0.128)(0.0821)(298)}{100}.
   \]  
   First, calculate the numerator:  
   \[
   0.128 \times 0.0821 \approx 0.01051, \quad 0.01051 \times 298 \approx 3.13.
   \]  
   Then divide by the volume:  
   \[
   P = \frac{3.13}{100} \approx 0.0313 \, \text{atm}.
   \]

4. **Convert to mmHg**:  
   Since \( 1 \, \text{atm} = 760 \, \text{mmHg} \), the vapor pressure in mmHg is:  
   \[
   P = 0.0313 \times 760 \approx 23.8 \, \text{mmHg}.
   \]

Thus, the vapor pressure of water at 25°C is approximately **23.8 mmHg**, which corresponds to option **F**.
