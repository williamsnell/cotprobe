Okay, so I have this question here about the binary number system and how many digits it has. Hmm, I remember that binary is one of the basic concepts in computer science, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

Wait, binary is the base-2 system, right? So that means it uses only two digits. I think those digits are 0 and 1. Yeah, that sounds familiar. I remember in school we learned about binary as the system computers use because they only understand two states, like on and off, which correspond to 0 and 1.

But wait, the question is asking how many digits the binary system has. So digits here mean the number of unique symbols used. Since it's base-2, that should mean two digits. So the options are A:0, B:1, C:2, D:10. So the correct answer should be C:2.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. Decimal is base-10, so it has ten digits (0-9). Binary is base-2, so digits are 0 and 1. So yes, two digits in total. That makes sense.

I don't think it's 10 because that's the decimal system. 0 isn't correct because every number system has at least one digit, but binary has two. So option C is the right one.

The binary number system is a base-2 system, which means it uses two digits: 0 and 1. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: 2

Answer: C
