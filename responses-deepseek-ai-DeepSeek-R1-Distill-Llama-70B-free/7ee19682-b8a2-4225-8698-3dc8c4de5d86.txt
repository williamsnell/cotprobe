Okay, so I've got this evidence question here about stock fraud and introducing a newspaper issue to show stock prices. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

So the scenario is an investor suing a corporation for stock fraud. During the case-in-chief, the investor wants to introduce a newspaper issue to show the stock price on a particular day. The corporation's attorney objects, and the question is whether this evidence should be admitted or excluded and why.

First, I remember that evidence law has several rules about what can be admitted. The main issue here is probably hearsay. Because the newspaper is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, which is the stock price. So, without an exception, it would be inadmissible as hearsay.

Wait, but there are exceptions. I think there's something called the business records exception under FRE 803(6). But wait, a newspaper isn't a business record of the corporation in question. The business records exception applies to records made by the entity itself in the regular course of business. So the newspaper is a third-party publication, not the corporation's own records. So maybe the business records exception doesn't apply here. So option B might not be correct.

Another possibility is the market reports exception. I recall that under FRE 803(21), there's an exception for market reports and similar compilations. It says that market quotations, lists, directories, or other compilations are admissible if they're published for use in a business context and the circumstances indicate they're reliable. So stock prices in a newspaper would likely fall under this exception. That would mean the evidence is admissible under option I.

Wait, but what about the best evidence rule? The best evidence rule (FRE 1002) requires the original document unless reasons are shown why it's unavailable. But here, the issue is the newspaper itself. If the investor has the actual newspaper, then the best evidence rule isn't an issue. Unless the original stock exchange records are better, but the newspaper is a secondary source. But the newspaper is admissible under the market reports exception, so the best evidence rule doesn't exclude it here. So option H, which says it's excluded because of the best evidence rule, isn't correct because the newspaper is an acceptable form under the exception.

Alternatively, some might think it's hearsay and no exception applies, making option G correct. But I think the market reports exception would cover it, so G would be wrong.

So putting it together: the newspaper's stock price is hearsay, but falls under the market reports exception, making it admissible. So the correct answer should be I.

The question revolves around whether a newspaper issue showing the corporation's stock price on a specific day is admissible as evidence in a stock fraud case. The key issue is whether this evidence falls under an exception to the hearsay rule.

1. **Hearsay Consideration**: The newspaper article is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (the stock price), making it hearsay. Without an applicable exception, it would be inadmissible.

2. **Business Records Exception (FRE 803(6))**: This exception applies to records made by a business in the regular course of its operations. However, a newspaper is not a business record of the corporation in question, so this exception does not apply. Thus, option B is incorrect.

3. **Market Reports Exception (FRE 803(21))**: This exception allows for the admission of market quotations, lists, or compilations published for use in business if they are reliable. Stock prices in a newspaper fall under this category, making the evidence admissible under this exception. Therefore, option I is correct.

4. **Best Evidence Rule (FRE 1002)**: This rule requires the original document unless it is unavailable. However, the newspaper itself is the relevant document in this case, and it is admissible under the market reports exception. Thus, option H is incorrect.

5. **Other Options**: Options A, C, D, E, F, and G are incorrect because they either misapply exceptions or fail to recognize the applicability of the market reports exception.

In conclusion, the newspaper's stock price is admissible under the market reports exception, making the correct answer:

**I: admitted, under the market reports exception.**

Answer: I
