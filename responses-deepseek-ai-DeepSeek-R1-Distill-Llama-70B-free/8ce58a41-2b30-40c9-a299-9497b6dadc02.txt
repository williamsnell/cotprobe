Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about marbles in a bag, and I need to find the probability that both marbles selected are the same color. 

Alright, let's start by understanding the setup. The bag has 4 red marbles and 6 blue marbles. So total marbles are 4 + 6 = 10. Got that. 

The problem says a marble is selected and not replaced, then a second is selected. So this is without replacement, which means the two draws are dependent events. The outcome of the first draw affects the second. 

I need to find the probability that both marbles are the same color. That could mean both red or both blue. So I think I should calculate the probability of both being red and both being blue, then add them together.

Let me break it down. 

First, the probability that the first marble is red. There are 4 red marbles out of 10, so that's 4/10. Then, since the first wasn't replaced, there are now 3 red marbles left and a total of 9 marbles. So the probability the second is also red is 3/9. 

To find the probability of both events happening (both red), I multiply the two probabilities. So (4/10) * (3/9) = (12/90). Simplifying that, 12 divided by 90 is 2/15. Hmm, that doesn't look right. Wait, 4*3 is 12, and 10*9 is 90. Yeah, that's correct. So 12/90 simplifies to 2/15. 

Wait, but wait, maybe I should think again. Because 4/10 is the same as 2/5, and 3/9 is 1/3. So 2/5 * 1/3 = 2/15. Yeah, same result. So the probability of both red is 2/15.

Now, let's calculate the probability of both marbles being blue. The first marble is blue, so there are 6 blue marbles out of 10. So 6/10 chance. Then, after taking one blue out, there are 5 blue left and 9 total marbles. So the probability the second is blue is 5/9.

Multiplying those gives (6/10)*(5/9) = (30/90). Simplifying 30/90 is 1/3. Wait, 30 divided by 90 is indeed 1/3. So the probability of both blue is 1/3. 

Wait, but I should add the two possibilities together because either both red or both blue counts as a success. So total probability is (2/15) + (1/3). 

Let me compute that. 1/3 is the same as 5/15, right? So 2/15 + 5/15 = 7/15. 

Hmm, but wait, I thought the options had 7/15. Let me check the options again. 

The options are:

A:6/15, B:9/15, C:1/15, D:8/15, E:1/8, F:4/15, G:5/15, H:3/15, I:7/15, J:2/15.

So 7/15 is option I. 

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through the calculations again.

Total marbles: 10. 

Probability both red: (4/10)*(3/9) = (4*3)/(10*9) = 12/90 = 2/15.

Probability both blue: (6/10)*(5/9) = 30/90 = 1/3. 

Adding them: 2/15 + 30/90. Wait, 30/90 is 1/3 which is 5/15. So 2 + 5 is 7, over 15. So 7/15. So the answer should be option I.

Alternatively, maybe a quicker way is to think about the possible outcomes where both are the same color. Same color can be red or blue. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the probability as:

P(both same) = P(both red) + P(both blue).

Which is exactly what I did. So I think my approach is correct. 

Another way to think about it: the first marble can be any color. Once I've picked the first marble, the second has to match it. 

So, for example, the first marble is red with probability 4/10. Then the second must be red, which is 3/9. Similarly, if the first is blue (6/10), the second must be blue (5/9). 

So adding (4/10 * 3/9) + (6/10 * 5/9) = (12 + 30)/90 = 42/90 = 7/15. 

Wait, wait, 42/90 simplifies to 7/15 because both 42 and 90 are divisible by 6. 42 รท6=7, 90 รท6=15. So yeah, 7/15. So that's correct.

So I think the answer is I.

To determine the probability that both marbles selected are the same color, we consider two scenarios: both marbles are red or both marbles are blue. The bag initially contains 4 red marbles and 6 blue marbles, making a total of 10 marbles. Since the first marble is not replaced, the second draw is dependent on the first.

1. **Both marbles are red**:  
   - The probability of drawing a red marble first is \( \frac{4}{10} \).  
   - After removing one red marble, the probability of drawing a second red marble is \( \frac{3}{9} \).  
   - The combined probability is:  
     \[
     \frac{4}{10} \times \frac{3}{9} = \frac{12}{90} = \frac{2}{15}.
     \]

2. **Both marbles are blue**:  
   - The probability of drawing a blue marble first is \( \frac{6}{10} \).  
   - After removing one blue marble, the probability of drawing a second blue marble is \( \frac{5}{9} \).  
   - The combined probability is:  
     \[
     \frac{6}{10} \times \frac{5}{9} = \frac{30}{90} = \frac{1}{3}.
     \]

3. **Total probability of both marbles being the same color**:  
   - Add the probabilities of both red and both blue:  
     \[
     \frac{2}{15} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{15} + \frac{5}{15} = \frac{7}{15}.
     \]

Thus, the probability that both marbles are the same color is \( \frac{7}{15} \), which corresponds to option **I**.
