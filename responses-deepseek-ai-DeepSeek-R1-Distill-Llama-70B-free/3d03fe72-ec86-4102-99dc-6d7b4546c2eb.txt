Okay, so I have this economics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that the money supply is affected by the actions of the Federal Reserve, banks, and the public. So the question is about how adding reserves and changes in currency holdings impact the money supply.

The problem says the Fed adds $500,000 to the banking system's reserves. The required reserve ratio is 30%, which means that banks have to hold 30% of their deposits as reserves. Also, it's given that banks don't hold any excess reserves. So they'll lend out all they can based on the reserve requirement.

Wait, but the public increases its currency holdings by $200,000. So people are holding more cash, which means they're taking money out of their bank deposits and into physical currency. That should affect the banks' deposits and thus the money supply.

Hmm, I think I need to use the money multiplier concept here. The money multiplier formula is usually 1 divided by the reserve ratio. But wait, that's when there's no change in currency or excess reserves. Wait, but in this case, the public is changing their currency holdings, so that affects the process.

Let me think about the process. When the Fed adds $500,000 to reserves, that's an injection into the banking system. But if the public takes some of that and holds it as cash, that reduces the amount that the banks can lend out, right?

So the initial addition is $500,000. But the public's $200,000 increase in currency means that part of that $500k is going into circulation, not staying in the banks. So the banks' reserves are actually increasing by $500k, but the public takes $200k of it as cash, so the banks' deposits might decrease by that amount?

Wait, maybe I should model this step by step. Let me outline the steps.

1. Fed adds $500,000 to the banking system. So initially, this would increase the banks' reserves by $500k.

2. But the public increases its holdings of currency by $200k. This means that the public is withdrawing $200k from their bank deposits to hold as cash. So the banks' deposits decrease by $200k, and their reserves decrease by the same amount because the money leaves the banking system into circulation.

Wait, but wait. Banks have to maintain the required reserve ratio. So when people take out cash, the banks' reserves drop. So let's see:

The initial injection is $500k in reserves. But then, when the public takes $200k in cash, the banks' reserves decrease by $200k (because the money is no longer in the bank, it's in the public's hands). So the net change in reserves is $500k - $200k = $300k.

Now, with this net change in reserves, and the reserve ratio being 30%, the banks can create new deposits based on the excess reserves.

Wait, but banks maintain no excess reserves, so they'll lend out all they can. The money multiplier is 1/(reserve ratio). So the multiplier here is 1/0.3 â‰ˆ 3.333...

But wait, the change in reserves is $300k. So the maximum possible increase in the money supply would be the change in reserves multiplied by the multiplier. So $300k * (1/0.3) = $1,000,000.

But wait, let me make sure. The process is:

Initial reserves increase by 500k. Then, $200k is taken out as cash, so the effective increase in reserves is 300k. Then, with a 30% reserve ratio, the banks can create deposits equal to (1/.3)*300k = 1,000k.

So the total change in money supply is +$1,000,000.

Wait, but another way to think about it is using the formula for money supply:

M = (C + D) where C is currency and D is deposits.

But when the Fed adds reserves, and some of that goes into currency, how does that balance out?

Alternatively, the change in the monetary base (M0) is the Fed's addition of 500k. But the public's currency holdings increase by 200k, so the change in reserves is 500k - 200k = 300k. Then, the money supply change is the change in reserves times the money multiplier.

So yes, 300k * (1/0.3) = 1,000k. So the money supply increases by $1,000,000.

Looking at the options, option G is $1,000,000. So the correct answer should be G.

To determine the effect on the money supply, we analyze the given scenario:

1. **Initial Injection of Reserves**: The Federal Reserve adds $500,000 to the banking system's reserves.

2. **Public's Increase in Currency Holdings**: The public increases its holdings of currency by $200,000. This means $200,000 is withdrawn from bank deposits and held as cash. As a result, the banks' reserves decrease by $200,000.

3. **Net Change in Reserves**: The net increase in bank reserves is $500,000 (from the Fed) minus $200,000 (withdrawn by the public), resulting in a net increase of $300,000 in reserves.

4. **Money Multiplier**: The required reserve ratio is 30%, so the money multiplier is calculated as \( \frac{1}{\text{reserve ratio}} = \frac{1}{0.3} \approx 3.333 \).

5. **Change in Money Supply**: The net increase in reserves ($300,000) is multiplied by the money multiplier to determine the total change in the money supply:
   \[
   \Delta M = 300,000 \times 3.333 \approx 1,000,000.
   \]

Thus, the money supply increases by $1,000,000.
