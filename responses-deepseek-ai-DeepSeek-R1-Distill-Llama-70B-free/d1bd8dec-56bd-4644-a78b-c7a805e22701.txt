Question:

InBrowningtown, water is sold to home owners by the cubic foot at the rate of $15.31 for up to and including 3,600 cubic feet, and $.15 for each 100 cubic feet over 3,600 cubic feet.

Options:

A: $64
B: $58
C: $70
D: $80
E: $66
F: $60
G: $78
H: $74
I: $72

Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Thomas family's water bill in Browningtown. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might have to think carefully.

First, the question says that water is sold by the cubic foot. The rate is $15.31 for up to and including 3,600 cubic feet. Then, anything over 3,600 cubic feet is charged at $0.15 per 100 cubic feet. Also, there's a local tax of 4% on the water usage. The Thomas family used 35,700 cubic feet, and I need to find out how much they were charged.

Hmm, let's see. So the first part of the bill is a flat rate for the first 3,600 cubic feet. That's straightforward—$15.31. But the rest is where I need to calculate.

The total usage is 35,700 cubic feet. So the amount over 3,600 is 35,700 - 3,600. Let me do that subtraction. 35,700 minus 3,600 equals 32,100 cubic feet. Wait, is that right? Yep, because 3,600 + 32,100 is 35,700.

Now, the rate for the part over 3,600 is $0.15 per 100 cubic feet. So I need to figure out how many 100s are in 32,100. That would be 32,100 divided by 100, which is 321. So that's 321 units of 100 cubic feet each.

Each of those units costs $0.15. So 321 times 0.15. Let me calculate that. 300 times 0.15 is 45, and 21 times 0.15 is 3.15. So 45 + 3.15 is $48.15.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 0.15 per 100 cubic feet. So each 100 is 0.15. So 321 * 0.15. Let me do that more accurately. 300 * 0.15 = 45, 21 * 0.15 is 3.15. So total is 48.15. So yes, that's correct.

So the bill without tax would be the flat rate plus the variable rate. That's 15.31 + 48.15. Let me add that up. 15 + 48 is 63, and 0.31 + 0.15 is 0.46. So total is 63.46 dollars.

But wait, I almost forgot the taxes. The local taxes are 4% on the water usage. So I need to calculate 4% of the total bill before tax and add that on.

So the pre-tax amount is $63.46. 4% of that is 0.04 times 63.46. Let me compute that. 63 * 0.04 is 2.52, and 0.46 * 0.04 is 0.0184. So adding those gives 2.52 + 0.0184 = 2.5384. So approximately $2.54.

So the total bill is 63.46 + 2.54. 63 + 2 is 65, and 0.46 + 0.54 is 1.00. So 65 + 1 = 66. So $66 total.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes rounding errors happen. Let me compute the tax more accurately. 63.46 * 0.04.

Calculating 63.46 * 0.04: 60 * 0.04 is 2.40, 3 * 0.04 is 0.12, 0.46 * 0.04 is 0.0184. So 2.40 + 0.12 is 2.52, plus 0.0184 is 2.5384. So yes, that's $2.5384, which is $2.54 when rounded to the nearest cent.

So adding $63.46 and $2.54 gives $66 exactly. So the total charge is $66.

Looking at the options, option E is $66. So the correct answer should be E.

The Thomas family's water bill is calculated based on the given rates and their usage of 35,700 cubic feet. 

1. **Flat Rate**: The first 3,600 cubic feet are charged at $15.31.  
2. **Variable Rate**: Usage over 3,600 cubic feet is charged at $0.15 per 100 cubic feet.  
   - Excess usage = 35,700 - 3,600 = 32,100 cubic feet.  
   - Number of 100 cubic foot units = 32,100 ÷ 100 = 321.  
   - Cost for excess usage = 321 × $0.15 = $48.15.  

3. **Subtotal Before Tax**:  
   - Total cost before tax = $15.31 (flat rate) + $48.15 (variable rate) = $63.46.  

4. **Taxes**: A 4% tax is applied to the subtotal.  
   - Tax amount = $63.46 × 0.04 = $2.54.  

5. **Total Bill**:  
   - Total cost including tax = $63.46 + $2.54 = $66.  

Thus, the total amount charged to the Thomas family is **$66**.  

The correct answer is **E**.
