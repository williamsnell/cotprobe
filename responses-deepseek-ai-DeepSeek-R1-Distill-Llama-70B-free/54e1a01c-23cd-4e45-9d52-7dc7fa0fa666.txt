Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the coefficient of the (x-8)^2 term in the Taylor polynomial for y = x^(2/3) around x=8. Hmm, I remember that Taylor series are used to expand functions around a particular point, and the coefficients involve derivatives evaluated at that point.

First, I think I should recall the general formula for the Taylor polynomial. The Taylor series expansion of a function y around a point a is given by:

y = y(a) + y’(a)(x-a) + (y''(a)/2!)(x-a)^2 + (y'''(a)/3!)(x-a)^3 + ... 

So, in this case, a is 8. I need to find the coefficient for the (x-8)^2 term, which would be y''(8) divided by 2 factorial, right?

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm getting that correctly. The coefficient is y''(a)/2! for the (x-a)^2 term. So yes, I need to compute the second derivative of y with respect to x, evaluate it at x=8, and then divide by 2!.

The function is y = x^(2/3). Let's compute the first derivative. The first derivative dy/dx = (2/3)x^(-1/3). Then the second derivative would be the derivative of that. So d²y/dx² = (2/3) * (-1/3) x^(-4/3) = (-2/9) x^(-4/3).

Now, I need to evaluate this second derivative at x=8. So substituting x=8 into the second derivative:

d²y/dx² at x=8 is (-2/9) * (8)^(-4/3). Let me compute 8^(-4/3). Since 8 is 2^3, so 8^(1/3) is 2. Therefore, 8^(4/3) = (8^(1/3))^4 = 2^4 = 16. So 8^(-4/3) is 1/16.

Putting it together: (-2/9) * (1/16) = (-2)/(144) = which simplifies to (-1)/72.

Wait wait, no. Let me recalculate that. (-2/9) * (1/16) = (-2) * (1) / (9*16) = (-2)/(144) = (-1)/72. Oh wait, no, 2/144 is 1/72, so yes, it's (-1)/72.

But wait, the coefficient in the Taylor series is (d²y/dx² at a) divided by 2!. 2! is 2. So the coefficient is [(-1)/72] / 2 = (-1)/(144).

So the coefficient is (-1)/144. Let me look at the options. Option G is -1/144. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I compute the second derivative correctly? Let me double-check. The function is x^(2/3). First derivative is (2/3)x^(-1/3), correct. Second derivative is (2/3)*(-1/3) x^(-4/3) = (-2/9) x^(-4/3). Yes, that's right.

Evaluating at x=8: 8^(-4/3) is 1/(8^(4/3)). 8^(1/3) is 2, so 8^(4/3) is 2^4=16. So 8^(-4/3) is 1/16. So (-2/9)*(1/16) = (-2)/(144)= (-1)/72. Then divide by 2! which is 2, so (-1)/(72*2) = (-1)/144. So yes, that's correct.

So the coefficient is -1/144, which is option G.

To determine the coefficient of the \((x-8)^2\) term in the Taylor polynomial for \(y = x^{2/3}\) around \(x = 8\), we use the Taylor series expansion formula:

\[
y = y(a) + y'(a)(x-a) + \frac{y''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \dots
\]

Here, \(a = 8\), and the coefficient of \((x-8)^2\) is given by \(\frac{y''(8)}{2!}\).

1. **First Derivative**:  
   \[
   y' = \frac{d}{dx} x^{2/3} = \frac{2}{3} x^{-1/3}
   \]

2. **Second Derivative**:  
   \[
   y'' = \frac{d}{dx} \left(\frac{2}{3} x^{-1/3}\right) = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) x^{-4/3} = -\frac{2}{9} x^{-4/3}
   \]

3. **Evaluate \(y''(8)\)**:  
   \[
   y''(8) = -\frac{2}{9} \cdot 8^{-4/3}
   \]
   Since \(8 = 2^3\), \(8^{1/3} = 2\), and \(8^{4/3} = (8^{1/3})^4 = 2^4 = 16\). Thus,  
   \[
   8^{-4/3} = \frac{1}{16}
   \]
   Substituting this back:  
   \[
   y''(8) = -\frac{2}{9} \cdot \frac{1}{16} = -\frac{2}{144} = -\frac{1}{72}
   \]

4. **Coefficient of \((x-8)^2\)**:  
   The coefficient is \(\frac{y''(8)}{2!} = \frac{-1/72}{2} = -\frac{1}{144}\).

Thus, the coefficient of the \((x-8)^2\) term is \(-\frac{1}{144}\), which corresponds to **Option G**.
