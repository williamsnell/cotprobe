Question:

The State of Florida is prosecuting a former police officer for extortion of money from prostitutes. One of the State's witnesses is Sally. Sally has an adult conviction for vehicular homicide. She was charged with driving a car in a reckless manner resulting in the death of her sister, a passenger in the car. Sally pleaded nolo contendere, was adjudicated guilty and received a suspended sentence although she could have received a sentence of state imprisonment up to 5 years. At trial, evidence of this conviction is

Options:

A: inadmissible to impeach Sally because the conviction is not related to the case.
B: inadmissible to impeach Sally because her conviction is more than a year old.
C: inadmissible to impeach Sally because she is only a witness and not the criminal defendant.
D: admissible to impeach Sally because she was adjudicated guilty.
E: inadmissible to impeach Sally because she never admitted her guilt since she entered a plea of nolo contendere.
F: admissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year.
G: admissible to impeach Sally because she was involved in an illegal activity.
H: inadmissible to impeach Sally because vehicular homicide is not a crime of moral turpitude.
I: inadmissible to impeach Sally because she received a suspended sentence.
J: admissible to impeach Sally because she could have received a sentence of state imprisonment up to 5 years.

Okay, so I've got this evidence law question here about impeaching a witness with a prior conviction. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about Sally, who's a witness for the State in a case against a former police officer charged with extortion. Sally has a conviction for vehicular homicide. She pleaded nolo contendere, was adjudicated guilty, and got a suspended sentence, though she could have gotten up to five years in prison.

The issue is whether her conviction can be used to impeach her credibility as a witness. I remember that evidence of a witness's conviction can be used to impeach them under certain conditions. 

First, I think about Federal Rule of Evidence 609, which deals with impeachment by evidence of conviction. The rule says that a witness can be impeached with a prior conviction if the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year, and the probative value isn't substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Also, the conviction must not be reversed or vacated. But wait, there's an exception for crimes involving moral turpitude, and sometimes even misdemeanors can be used if they involve dishonesty.

Wait, vehicular homicide—what's that classified as? I think it's a felony because it can result in a sentence over a year. Even though Sally only got a suspended sentence, the potential sentence was up to five years, which is more than a year. So under FRE 609, that would qualify because the possible punishment is over a year.

But wait, Sally pleaded nolo contendere. Does that affect anything? I remember that nolo contendere is a plea where the defendant doesn't admit guilt but agrees to accept punishment. For purposes of evidence, I think a conviction after a nolo plea is still considered a conviction. So in this case, since she was adjudicated guilty, it's treated as a conviction for impeachment purposes.

So looking at the options:

Option D says it's admissible because she was adjudicated guilty. That makes sense because the adjudication makes it a conviction.

Option E says it's inadmissible because she didn't admit guilt with the nolo plea. But I think the nolo plea still results in a conviction, so E might not be correct.

Option F says admissible because vehicular homicide carries a max penalty over a year. That seems correct because it meets the FRE 609 criteria.

Option J says admissible because she could have received up to five years. That also points to the same reasoning as F.

Wait, but J is about the possible sentence she could have received. FRE 609 looks at the maximum possible sentence for the crime, not the actual sentence given. So since vehicular homicide can be punished by up to five years, it's a felony, making the conviction admissible.

But I should also consider if vehicular homicide is a crime of moral turpitude. Moral turpitude crimes are those that involve dishonesty or a lack of good morals. Vehicular homicide might not necessarily be such a crime—it's more about recklessness or negligence. So it might not involve moral turpitude, which could affect whether it's admissible under some rules, but under FRE 609, it's more about the punishment length and whether it's a felony.

Also, the time since the conviction isn't an issue here. The question doesn't say how old the conviction is, but the options B mentions it's more than a year old. But since the question doesn't specify, I can't rely on that as a factor.

Option H says it's inadmissible because vehicular homicide isn't a crime of moral turpitude. But under FRE 609, the key factors are the punishment and whether it's a felony, not whether it's a crime of moral turpitude. So H might not be the right reason.

So looking back, the correct reasoning is that the conviction is for a felony punishable by more than a year, making it admissible. So options F and J both relate to this.

Wait, but F says "vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year." That's correct because the maximum is five years. J says she could have received up to five years, which is also correct. So both F and J seem correct, but looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, let me check the rule again. FRE 609(a) says evidence of a conviction is admissible if it's a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year. So the determining factor is the maximum possible sentence for the crime, not the sentence the person actually received. So Sally's possible sentence was five years, so it's a felony, making it admissible. So both F and J are about this point, but F is about the crime's maximum, J is about her possible sentence.

Wait, but Sally's conviction is for vehicular homicide, which is a felony. So regardless of her actual sentence, the fact that it's a felony makes it admissible. So I think both F and J are correct in their reasoning, but let's see the options.

Looking back, the options are:

F: admissible because vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty in excess of 1 year.

J: admissible because she could have received a sentence of state imprisonment up to 5 years.

So both F and J are correct, but looking at the options, which one is the answer? Or perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, no, the question is about whether the evidence is admissible. So both F and J are correct statements. But in the options, perhaps only one is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps J is correct because the actual possible sentence she faced was up to five years, which is more than a year. So under 609, it's admissible.

But F is also correct because the maximum penalty for the crime is over a year. So both F and J seem to point to the same conclusion.

Wait, but in the options, only one can be correct. Let me check the answer options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: inadmissible because not related.

B: inadmissible because over a year old.

C: inadmissible because she's a witness.

D: admissible because adjudicated guilty.

E: inadmissible because nolo plea.

F: admissible because max penalty over 1 year.

G: admissible because illegal activity.

H: inadmissible because not moral turpitude.

I: inadmissible because suspended sentence.

J: admissible because could have received up to 5 years.

So both F and J are correct, but perhaps the better answer is F because it's about the crime's maximum penalty, which is the standard under FRE 609. Alternatively, J is correct because it's about her possible sentence.

Wait, no, the rule uses the crime's maximum possible sentence, not the defendant's possible sentence. So for example, if a crime has a maximum of 5 years, but the defendant only got 6 months, it's still admissible as a felony conviction. So F is correct because the crime's max is over a year.

So the correct answer should be F or J.

Wait, but the question states that Sally could have received up to 5 years. But the crime's maximum penalty is indeed over a year, so F is correct.

But wait, what about the fact that she received a suspended sentence? Does that affect admissibility? I don't think so. The rule looks at the crime's possible punishment, not the actual sentence imposed. So even if she didn't serve time, it's still a felony conviction.

So the correct options are F and J. But since both can't be correct, perhaps the intended answer is F.

Wait, but let me think again. FRE 609(a)(1) says that evidence of a conviction is admissible if it's a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year. So the focus is on the crime's maximum possible sentence, not the actual sentence the person received. So F is correct.

But J says she could have received up to five years—so that's also pointing to the same thing, but perhaps that's not the exact reason. Because the law looks at the maximum possible for the crime, not the specific defendant's exposure.

So I think the correct answer is F. But wait, looking back at the options, the correct answer is F or J? Or perhaps D is correct because she was adjudicated guilty, making it a conviction.

Wait, D says admissible because she was adjudicated guilty. That's also correct because a conviction requires an adjudication of guilt. So her plea of nolo contendere resulted in an adjudication, so it's a conviction.

So both D and F seem to have correct points. But I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, the initial question is about whether the evidence is admissible. So the key points are:

1. Is it a conviction? Yes, because she was adjudicated guilty, so D is correct.

2. Is the conviction for a crime with a sentence over a year? Yes, so F and J are correct.

So the evidence is admissible because it's a conviction for a felony.

Wait, but the options are separate. So the correct answer could be D, F, or J.

But looking at the options, I think the best answer is F and J, but let me think again.

Wait, the question is about whether the evidence is admissible. So the reasoning must be that the conviction is for a felony, which is admissible under 609.

So the options are:

D: admissible because she was adjudicated guilty.

F: admissible because the crime's max penalty is over a year.

So both D and F are correct in their reasoning. But which option is the correct answer?

Wait, the question asks which option correctly states the admissibility. So both D and F could be answers, but looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F because it's about the punishment, which is the main factor under 609. But D is also correct because being adjudicated guilty makes it a conviction.

Wait, no, the admissibility isn't just about being a conviction; it's also about the nature of the crime. So the fact that she has a conviction is necessary, but the crime must meet the punishment requirement.

So the correct answer would be F or J, as they address the punishment aspect.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to outline:

For a conviction to be admissible under FRE 609, two main points:

1. It must be a conviction (so D is correct that she was adjudicated guilty, making it a conviction).

2. The crime must be punishable by more than a year (so F and J are correct).

So the evidence is admissible because it's a conviction for a felony. Therefore, both D and F are correct, but the options don't have a choice that combines both. So perhaps the best answer is F or J.

Wait, but the options are separate. So the correct answer must be either F or J.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because it's a conviction, and F because it's a felony. But since only one option can be correct, I need to choose the best one.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F because it directly addresses the punishment aspect, which is the main factor under 609.

But I'm also considering that some might think that a nolo plea doesn't count as a conviction, but I think it does. Because under the rules, a nolo plea results in a conviction for purposes of impeachment.

So option E says it's inadmissible because she didn't admit guilt. But that's incorrect because a nolo plea does result in a conviction.

So the correct answer must be either F or J.

Wait, the question gives that Sally could have received up to five years. So the maximum possible sentence for the crime is five years, which is more than a year. So F is correct because the crime's max penalty is over a year.

Therefore, the correct answer is F.
</think>

To determine whether Sally's conviction for vehicular homicide can be used to impeach her credibility as a witness, we must analyze the admissibility of the conviction under the rules of evidence, specifically Federal Rule of Evidence 609. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Nature of the Conviction**: Sally pleaded *nolo contendere*, which does not admit guilt but results in a conviction for purposes of impeachment. Her adjudication of guilt confirms that this is a valid conviction.

2. **Felony Classification**: Vehicular homicide is a felony because it carries a maximum penalty of up to five years' imprisonment, which exceeds one year. Under FRE 609, a conviction for a crime punishable by more than one year is admissible to impeach a witness unless the probative value is substantially outweighed by prejudice.

3. **Moral Turpitude**: While vehicular homicide may not necessarily involve moral turpitude, this is irrelevant under FRE 609, which focuses on the crime's punishment, not its moral nature.

4. **Sentence Imposed**: The fact that Sally received a suspended sentence does not affect admissibility. The rule considers the crime's maximum possible sentence, not the actual sentence imposed.

5. **Time Since Conviction**: The question does not specify how old the conviction is, so this is not a relevant factor.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A**: Incorrect. The conviction is admissible regardless of its relation to the case at hand.
- **B**: Incorrect. The age of the conviction is not provided, and it is not a basis for exclusion in this context.
- **C**: Incorrect. A witness's prior conviction can be used to impeach their credibility.
- **D**: Correct. Sally was adjudicated guilty, making this a valid conviction for impeachment purposes.
- **E**: Incorrect. A *nolo contendere* plea results in a conviction, so this is not a valid reason for exclusion.
- **F**: Correct. Vehicular homicide carries a maximum penalty exceeding one year, making it a felony and admissible under FRE 609.
- **G**: Incorrect. The admissibility of the conviction is based on the crime's punishment, not its illegality.
- **H**: Incorrect. The moral turpitude of the crime is irrelevant under FRE 609.
- **I**: Incorrect. The suspended sentence does not affect the admissibility of the conviction.
- **J**: Correct. Sally could have received a sentence of up to five years, which exceeds one year, making the conviction admissible.

### Conclusion:
Both **D** and **F** are correct because they address the conviction's validity and the felony classification, respectively. However, the question requires selecting only one option. The better answer is **F**, as it directly addresses the felony classification based on the crime's maximum penalty, which is the primary factor under FRE 609.
