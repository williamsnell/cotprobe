Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an x-ray machine that uses a capacitor. Hmm, I remember that capacitors store electrical energy, and when they discharge, that energy is released. The question gives me some specific numbers and asks me to find the charge supplied, the average current, and the energy dissipated.

Let me read the problem again. The capacitor has a capacitance of 0.25 microfarads. Oh wait, micro is 10^-6, so that's 0.25e-6 farads. It's charged to 100 kV, which is 100,000 volts, and then discharged down to 40 kV. The exposure time is 0.1 seconds. So I need to find the charge, current, and energy.

First, I think I should calculate the charge supplied. Since the capacitor is discharging from 100 kV to 40 kV, the charge it supplies is the difference between the initial and final charge. Because the charge on a capacitor is Q = C * V.

So initial voltage is 100,000 V, final is 40,000 V. The capacitance is 0.25e-6 F.

So initial charge Q_initial = C * V_initial = 0.25e-6 F * 100,000 V. Let me compute that. 0.25e-6 * 1e5 = 0.25 * 1e-1 = 0.025 C? Wait, because 1e5 is 10^5, so 1e5 * 1e-6 is 1e-1, so 0.25 * 0.1 is 0.025 C.

Wait, no, wait: 0.25e-6 * 1e5 = 0.25 * (1e-6 * 1e5) )= 0.25 * 1e-1 = 0.025 C. Oh yes, that's correct.

Then the final charge Q_final = C * V_final = 0.25e-6 F * 40,000 V. Let me compute that. 0.25e-6 *4e4 = 0.25 * (4e4 * 1e-6) )= 0.25 * 4e-2 = 0.25 *0.04 = 0.01 C.

So the charge supplied by the capacitor is Q_initial - Q_final = 0.025 C - 0.01 C = 0.015 C. So that's the charge. Let me check the options. Option B has charge 0.015 C, E has 0.018, J 0.017, etc.

Next, the average current. Current is charge per time. So I is Q / t. The charge is 0.015 C, time is 0.1 seconds. So I = 0.015 / 0.1 = 0.15 A, which is 150 mA. So average current is 150 mA.

Looking at the options again, option B says current 150 mA. So that matches. What about energy?

The energy stored in a capacitor is (1/2) C V^2. So I need to find the initial energy and the final energy, subtract them to get the energy dissipated.

Initial energy E_initial = 0.5 * C * V_initial^2. C is 0.25e-6 F, V_initial is 1e5 V.

So E_initial = 0.5 * 0.25e-6 * (1e5)^2. Compute that step by step. (1e5)^2 is 1e10. So 0.5 * 0.25e-6 = 0.125e-6 = 1.25e-7. Multiply by 1e10 gives 1.25e3, which is 1250 J.

Final energy E_final = 0.5 * C * V_final^2 = 0.5 * 0.25e-6 * (4e4)^2.

(4e4)^2 is 16e8. So 0.5 *0.25e-6 is 0.125e-6. Multiply by 16e8: 0.125e-6 *16e8 = (0.125 *16) * 1e2 = 2 *1e2 = 200 J.

So energy dissipated is E_initial - E_final = 1250 J - 200 J = 1050 J.

Now let's see the options. Option B says energy 1050 J, which matches. So all three values: charge 0.015 C, current 150 mA, energy 1050 J.

So the correct option is B.

To solve the problem, we calculate the charge supplied, the average current, and the energy dissipated by the x-ray equipment.

1. **Charge Supplied**:  
   The charge supplied by the capacitor is the difference between the initial charge and the final charge. Using the formula \( Q = C \cdot V \):  
   - Initial charge: \( Q_{\text{initial}} = 0.25 \, \mu\text{F} \cdot 100 \, \text{kV} = 0.025 \, \text{C} \)  
   - Final charge: \( Q_{\text{final}} = 0.25 \, \mu\text{F} \cdot 40 \, \text{kV} = 0.01 \, \text{C} \)  
   - Charge supplied: \( Q = Q_{\text{initial}} - Q_{\text{final}} = 0.025 \, \text{C} - 0.01 \, \text{C} = 0.015 \, \text{C} \).

2. **Average Current**:  
   The average current is given by \( I = \frac{Q}{t} \), where \( t = 0.1 \, \text{s} \):  
   - \( I = \frac{0.015 \, \text{C}}{0.1 \, \text{s}} = 0.15 \, \text{A} = 150 \, \text{mA} \).

3. **Energy Dissipated**:  
   The energy dissipated is the difference between the initial energy and the final energy stored in the capacitor. Using the formula \( E = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \):  
   - Initial energy: \( E_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.25 \, \mu\text{F} \cdot (100 \, \text{kV})^2 = 1250 \, \text{J} \)  
   - Final energy: \( E_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.25 \, \mu\text{F} \cdot (40 \, \text{kV})^2 = 200 \, \text{J} \)  
   - Energy dissipated: \( E = E_{\text{initial}} - E_{\text{final}} = 1250 \, \text{J} - 200 \, \text{J} = 1050 \, \text{J} \).

Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct answer is **Option B**:  
- Charge: \( 0.015 \, \text{C} \), Current: \( 150 \, \text{mA} \), Energy: \( 1050 \, \text{J} \).

**Answer: B**
