Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric and magnetic fields acting on a test charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but let's try to work through this.

The problem gives me three different forces experienced by a test charge q when it's moving at different velocities. The velocities are in the x, y, and z directions. I need to find the electric field E and the magnetic field B at that point.

Let me recall the Lorentz force law. The force on a charge is F = q(E + v × B). Right, so the force is the sum of the electric part and the magnetic part which involves the cross product of velocity and magnetic field.

The problem gives three scenarios:

1. F₁ = q[E₀ i_x + (E₀ - v₀ B₀) i_y] when v₁ = v₀ i_x.
2. F₂ = q[(E₀ + v₀ B₀) i_x + E₀ i_y] when v₂ = v₀ i_y.
3. F₃ = q[E₀ i_x + E₀ i_y] when v₃ = v₀ i_z.

Wait, so each F is a vector with components in x and y. Let me break each case down.

Starting with the first case: v is along x. So v = v₀ i_x. The force F₁ has x and y components. Let's write the Lorentz force equation for this case.

F₁ = q (E + v × B). So,

E = E_x i_x + E_y i_y + E_z i_z
v = v₀ i_x

v × B is the cross product. Let me compute that. Let me write B as B_x i_x + B_y i_y + B_z i_z.

v × B = (v₀ i_x) × (B_x i_x + B_y i_y + B_z i_z)
       = v₀ [i_x × i_x * B_x + i_x × i_y * B_y + i_x × i_z * B_z]
       = v₀ [0 + B_y (i_z) - B_z (i_y)] 
       = v₀ (B_y i_z - B_z i_y)

Wait, no. Wait, cross product of i_x and i_x is zero. i_x × i_y is i_z. i_x × i_z is -i_y. So yes, that's right.

So the magnetic part is v × B = v₀ (B_y i_z - B_z i_y).

So F₁ is q(E + v × B), which would have components:

F₁_x = q(E_x + 0) because the x-component of v × B is zero here. Because in the expression above, the x component is zero. Wait, no. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, no. Let me correct. The cross product v × B has components:

i_x × i_x is 0, i_x × i_y is i_z, i_x × i_z is -i_y. So:

v × B is (0) i_x + (something) i_y + (something) i_z. Wait no, let me compute each component.

Wait, the cross product in terms of components is:

i_x × i_x = 0 → so for B_x, the x-component of B, the cross product with i_x (v direction) gives zero.

i_x × i_y = i_z → so the B_y part contributes to the z-component.

i_x × i_z = -i_y → so the B_z part contributes to the negative y-component.

So, the cross product v × B is:

v × B = (v₀ i_x) × (B_x i_x + B_y i_y + B_z i_z)
= v₀ ( (i_x × i_x) B_x + (i_x × i_y) B_y + (i_x × i_z) B_z )
= v₀ (0 + B_y i_z - B_z i_y )

So, the cross product vector is (0, -B_z v₀, B_y v₀ )

So when we add E and v×B, the components are:

E_x + 0 → E_x
E_y - v₀ B_z → E_y - v₀ B_z
E_z + v₀ B_y → E_z + v₀ B_y

So the force F₁ is F₁_x i_x + F₁_y i_y + F₁_z i_z, but in this case, the problem says F₁ has components in x and y, so F₁_z is zero. That might help.

Wait, looking back, the given F₁ is q[E₀ i_x + (E₀ - v₀ B₀) i_y]. So F₁ has no z-component. So F₁_z must be zero.

In our expression above, F₁_z is q (E_z + v₀ B_y ). So:

q(E_z + v₀ B_y ) = 0 → E_z + v₀ B_y = 0 → E_z = - v₀ B_y.

Hmm, but without more information, maybe I can't find E_z yet.

Looking at F₁'s x and y components:

F₁_x = q E_x → from the given F₁_x = q E₀ → So E_x = E₀.

F₁_y = q (E_y - v₀ B_z) → given F₁_y = q (E₀ - v₀ B₀ )

So, E_y - v₀ B_z = E₀ - v₀ B₀ → E_y = E₀ - v₀ B₀ + v₀ B_z.

Wait, but I don't know B_z yet. Hmm.

Let me move to the second case. v₂ is v₀ i_y.

So v = v₀ i_y.

Compute v × B again. B is (B_x, B_y, B_z). So,

v × B = (v₀ i_y) × (B_x i_x + B_y i_y + B_z i_z )
= v₀ [ (i_y × i_x) B_x + (i_y × i_y ) B_y + (i_y × i_z ) B_z ]

i_y × i_x = -i_z
i_y × i_y = 0
i_y × i_z = i_x

So,

v × B = v₀ [ (-i_z) B_x + 0 + i_x B_z ]
= v₀ (-B_x i_z + B_z i_x )

So the components are:

i_x: v₀ B_z
i_y: 0
i_z: -v₀ B_x

Now, the force F₂ is E + v×B, so:

F₂_x = E_x + v₀ B_z
F₂_y = E_y + 0 → E_y
F₂_z = E_z - v₀ B_x

But according to the problem, F₂ is given as [ (E₀ + v₀ B₀ ) i_x + E₀ i_y ].

So F₂_z must be zero.

So,

F₂_z = q (E_z - v₀ B_x ) = 0 → E_z = v₀ B_x.

Wait, earlier from the first case, we had E_z = - v₀ B_y.

So, now E_z = v₀ B_x = - v₀ B_y → So v₀ B_x = - v₀ B_y → B_x = - B_y.

Assuming v₀ is not zero, which it is, since it's given as a velocity.

So B_x = - B_y.

Now, let's look at F₂'s components. F₂_x is given as (E₀ + v₀ B₀ ), so:

F₂_x = q (E_x + v₀ B_z ) = q (E₀ + v₀ B_z )

But from F₂ given, F₂_x = q (E₀ + v₀ B₀ )

So,

E_x + v₀ B_z = E₀ + v₀ B₀ → But E_x is E₀ (from F₁_x), so substituting:

E₀ + v₀ B_z = E₀ + v₀ B₀ → So,

v₀ B_z = v₀ B₀ → B_z = B₀.

Great, so B_z is B₀.

And from earlier, E_z = v₀ B_x.

But from F₂_z, E_z = v₀ B_x. And E_z is also equal to -v₀ B_y.

So,

v₀ B_x = - v₀ B_y → B_x = - B_y.

So, if I can find B_x or B_y, I can get the other.

Now, let's look at F₂_y:

F₂_y = q E_y = q E₀ → So E_y = E₀.

Wait, but earlier in the first case, we had E_y = E₀ - v₀ B₀ + v₀ B_z.

Since B_z is B₀,

E_y = E₀ - v₀ B₀ + v₀ B₀ → E_y = E₀.

Which matches the F₂_y condition. So that's consistent.

So E_y is E₀.

Now, let's move to the third case: v₃ = v₀ i_z.

So v is in the z direction. Compute v × B.

v = v₀ i_z.

So,

v × B = (v₀ i_z) × (B_x i_x + B_y i_y + B_z i_z )
= v₀ [ (i_z × i_x) B_x + (i_z × i_y ) B_y + (i_z × i_z ) B_z ]

i_z × i_x = i_y
i_z × i_y = -i_x
i_z × i_z = 0

So,

v × B = v₀ (i_y B_x - i_x B_y )

So the components:

i_x: -v₀ B_y
i_y: v₀ B_x
i_z: 0

So the force F₃ is E + v × B:

F₃_x = E_x - v₀ B_y
F₃_y = E_y + v₀ B_x
F₃_z = E_z

But according to the problem, F₃ is q (E₀ i_x + E₀ i_y ), which means F₃ has no z-component. So F₃_z = 0.

So,

F₃_z = q E_z = 0 → E_z = 0.

Wait, but earlier we had E_z = v₀ B_x. Because from F₂_z, E_z = v₀ B_x. And from F₁_z, E_z = - v₀ B_y.

So,

E_z = 0 = v₀ B_x → B_x = 0.

But earlier, B_x = - B_y.

So if B_x = 0, then B_y must be 0 as well.

Wait, that's interesting. So B_x and B_y are both zero.

So B = (0, 0, B_z) = B_z i_z. And earlier, we found B_z = B₀.

So B = B₀ i_z.

Wait, that makes sense. So B is along the z direction.

So E_z was v₀ B_x, but B_x is zero, so E_z = 0.

So E has components E_x, E_y, E_z=0.

From earlier, E_x = E₀.

E_y = E₀.

So E = E₀ i_x + E₀ i_y.

So E is E₀ (i_x + i_y).

Wait, that's what option A says: E = E₀ (i_x + i_y), B= B₀ i_z.

Wait, but let me double-check with the third case. Let's confirm.

In the third case, F₃ = q(E + v × B). So F₃ should be:

F₃_x = E_x - v₀ B_y = E₀ - v₀ * 0 = E₀.

F₃_y = E_y + v₀ B_x = E₀ + v₀ * 0 = E₀.

F₃_z = 0.

So F₃ = q (E₀ i_x + E₀ i_y ), which matches the given F₃.

So that's correct.

So putting it all together:

E = E₀ (i_x + i_y )

B = B₀ i_z.

Looking at the options:

Option A: E= E0 (ix + iy), B= B0 iz → Yes, that's correct.

Another option is F: E = same, B= -B0 iz. But from our calculation, B is +B0 iz.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the forces experienced by the test charge \( q \) in three different scenarios using the Lorentz force law:

\[
\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}),
\]

where \(\mathbf{E}\) is the electric field, \(\mathbf{B}\) is the magnetic field, and \(\mathbf{v}\) is the velocity of the charge. The goal is to determine \(\mathbf{E}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\) at the given point.

### Case 1: \(\mathbf{v}_1 = v_0 \mathbf{i}_x\)
The force is given as:
\[
\mathbf{F}_1 = q[E_0 \mathbf{i}_x + (E_0 - v_0 B_0) \mathbf{i}_y].
\]
From the Lorentz force law:
\[
\mathbf{F}_1 = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}_1 \times \mathbf{B}).
\]
Breaking this into components:
- The \(x\)-component: \(F_{1x} = qE_x\), which gives \(E_x = E_0\).
- The \(y\)-component: \(F_{1y} = q(E_y - v_0 B_z)\), which gives \(E_y - v_0 B_z = E_0 - v_0 B_0\). Thus, \(E_y = E_0 - v_0 B_0 + v_0 B_z\).
- The \(z\)-component: \(F_{1z} = q(E_z + v_0 B_y)\). Since \(\mathbf{F}_1\) has no \(z\)-component, \(E_z + v_0 B_y = 0\), or \(E_z = -v_0 B_y\).

### Case 2: \(\mathbf{v}_2 = v_0 \mathbf{i}_y\)
The force is given as:
\[
\mathbf{F}_2 = q[(E_0 + v_0 B_0) \mathbf{i}_x + E_0 \mathbf{i}_y].
\]
From the Lorentz force law:
\[
\mathbf{F}_2 = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}_2 \times \mathbf{B}).
\]
Breaking this into components:
- The \(x\)-component: \(F_{2x} = q(E_x + v_0 B_z)\), which gives \(E_x + v_0 B_z = E_0 + v_0 B_0\). Since \(E_x = E_0\), it follows that \(B_z = B_0\).
- The \(y\)-component: \(F_{2y} = qE_y\), which gives \(E_y = E_0\).
- The \(z\)-component: \(F_{2z} = q(E_z - v_0 B_x)\). Since \(\mathbf{F}_2\) has no \(z\)-component, \(E_z - v_0 B_x = 0\), or \(E_z = v_0 B_x\).

### Case 3: \(\mathbf{v}_3 = v_0 \mathbf{i}_z\)
The force is given as:
\[
\mathbf{F}_3 = q[E_0 \mathbf{i}_x + E_0 \mathbf{i}_y].
\]
From the Lorentz force law:
\[
\mathbf{F}_3 = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}_3 \times \mathbf{B}).
\]
Breaking this into components:
- The \(x\)-component: \(F_{3x} = q(E_x - v_0 B_y)\), which gives \(E_x - v_0 B_y = E_0\). Since \(E_x = E_0\), it follows that \(B_y = 0\).
- The \(y\)-component: \(F_{3y} = q(E_y + v_0 B_x)\), which gives \(E_y + v_0 B_x = E_0\). Since \(E_y = E_0\), it follows that \(B_x = 0\).
- The \(z\)-component: \(F_{3z} = qE_z\). Since \(\mathbf{F}_3\) has no \(z\)-component, \(E_z = 0\).

### Final Results
From the above cases:
- \(\mathbf{E} = E_0 (\mathbf{i}_x + \mathbf{i}_y)\),
- \(\mathbf{B} = B_0 \mathbf{i}_z\).

### Verification with Options
The correct option is **A**: \(E = E_0 (\mathbf{i}_x + \mathbf{i}_y), B = B_0 \mathbf{i}_z\).
