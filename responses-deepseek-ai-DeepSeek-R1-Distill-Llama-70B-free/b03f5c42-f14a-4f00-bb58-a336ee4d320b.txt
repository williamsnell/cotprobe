The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A dance student worked very hard to strengthen her legs, including performing additional activities such as leaping and bounding up multiple flights of stairs in her apartment building. While she was performing her exercises, one of the janitors in the building warned her that "she was bound to get hurt if she keeps it up, because there are problems with the floor." After falling and breaking a leg due to a loose floorboard, she brought suit against the building owner. The building owner wants to testify that: "The janitor told me 'I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt.' ". Is the building owner's statement likely to be held admissible?

Options:

A: No, because it is hearsay, the janitor's statement is not a public record.
B: Yes, because it is an exception to hearsay as a recorded recollection.
C: Yes, because it is an exception to hearsay as a statement made for medical diagnosis or treatment.
D: Yes, because it is as an exception to hearsay as a spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party.
E: No, because it is hearsay and the building owner is not a credible source.
F: Yes, because it is an exception to hearsay as a statement of then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition.
G: No, because it is hearsay within hearsay, and there are no hearsay exceptions that apply.
H: Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him.
I: No, because it is irrelevant and immaterial.
J: No, because it is hearsay and there are no exceptions that would allow for the janitor's statement to be admissible.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here about hearsay exceptions. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might need to break it down carefully.

The scenario is about a dance student who was doing a lot of exercise, including activities like leaping and bounding up stairs. A janitor warned her that she was bound to get hurt because of problems with the floor. Then she fell and broke her leg because of a loose floorboard. She sued the building owner, and now the building owner wants to testify about what the janitor told him. The statement is: "The janitor told me 'I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt.'"

The question is whether this statement is admissible. The options are A through J, each giving different reasons based on hearsay rules and exceptions.

First, I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, the building owner is testifying about what the janitor told him. That would be hearsay because it's a statement made by the janitor (not the testifier) to prove that he did warn her, which is relevant to whether the owner had knowledge or took action.

But wait, the building owner is the one testifying. So, he's recounting what the janitor said to him. So, the content of the janitor's statement is being offered for the truth—that the owner knew about the danger. So, this is hearsay within hearsay? Or just a single level?

Wait, no—each layer is a separate hearsay. The janitor's statement to the owner is the first level, and the owner's testimony about it is the second. Wait, no. The owner is testifying about the janitor's statement. So it's one level of hearsay: the janitor's statement to the owner. Unless the statement itself contains another layer, but in this case, the janitor is directly talking to the owner, so it's just one level.

So, the issue is whether the janitor's statement falls under any hearsay exception. Let's think about the exceptions. The main ones I can remember are:

- Present-sense impression (excited utterance might be a subset, but that's more for spontaneous statements)
- Statement against interest
- Dying declaration
- Statement for medical diagnosis
- Business records
- Public records
- Declarations of pedigree, etc.
- Then existing mental state.

Wait, the janitor's statement to the owner is about the warning he gave to the student. The owner is using it to show that he (the owner) had knowledge of the problem, perhaps, or that he took some action.

But in this case, the statement is the janitor telling the owner, "I told her that running too fast is dangerous and she was bound to get hurt." So, the owner is trying to get in evidence that the janitor gave a warning to the student. But the truth is, the owner is trying to prove that the janitor did warn her, which might relate to the owner's duty or knowledge.

Wait, no. The building owner's statement is about what the janitor told him. The content is the janitor's warning to the student. So, the owner is testifying to the janitor's statement to him. So, the purpose is to show that the owner knew about the danger because the janitor told him about the warning.

Wait, perhaps the owner is trying to establish that he had knowledge of the dangerous condition. If the janitor told him that he warned the student, then the owner would know about the problem. Alternatively, maybe the owner is trying to show that he wasn't negligent because the janitor had warned the student.

But let's focus on the hearsay issue. The owner's testimony about the janitor's statement is hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement (janitor's) offered to prove the truth (that the owner knew about the danger, or that the student was warned).

So, is there an exception that applies here? Let's look at the options given.

Option A says it's not admissible because it's hearsay and not a public record. But maybe another exception applies.

Option B: Exception as recorded recollection. I don't think so. Recorded recollection is when the witness can't remember but has a record. That doesn't apply here.

Option C: Statement made for medical diagnosis. No, the context is a warning about danger, not medical.

Option D: Spontaneous declaration to an opponent-party. Spontaneous declarations are excited utterances, made in the heat of the moment. But here, the janitor's statement to the owner doesn't seem to be spontaneous. It's a warning given earlier. So maybe not.

Option E: Hearsay, and owner not credible. But credibility goes to weight, not admissibility. So this doesn't make it inadmissible.

Option F: Statement of then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition. That exception applies when the statement relates to the declarant's current state. For example, "I'm so angry" would fit. But here, the janitor is talking about a past action (warning the student). So not sure. Alternatively, if the janitor's statement is about his own state of mind, like "I was worried," but in this case, it's more about conveying information about the student's actions and the danger.

Option G: Hearsay within hearsay, no exceptions. But wait, is this hearsay within hearsay? The owner is testifying about the janitor's statement, which is one level. So it's only one level of hearsay, not hearsay within hearsay, unless the janitor's statement itself contains another statement. But in this case, the janitor's statement is about his own statement to the student. So the janitor's statement is, "I told her X." So when the owner testifies to that, it's the janitor's statement about his own statement to the student. So that's two layers: the student's action, and the janitor's statement about it. Wait, no—the janitor's statement to the owner is, "I told her..." So the janitor is making a statement about what he said to the student. So the owner is testifying to the janitor's statement, which is about the student. So, that's hearsay within hearsay. Because the janitor's statement is offered for the truth of what he told the student. So two levels: the owner's testimony about the janitor's statement, and the janitor's statement about his own statement to the student. So each is a hearsay layer.

So, for hearsay within hearsay, both layers need to satisfy hearsay exceptions. So, the first layer is the janitor's statement to the owner. The second layer is the janitor's statement to the student.

So, the first layer: the janitor's statement to the owner. Is that hearsay? Yes, offered for the truth that the janitor did warn the student. So, unless an exception applies, it's inadmissible. The second layer is the janitor's statement to the student, which is again hearsay, but perhaps it's a statement by a party opponent? Wait, the janitor is an employee, so statements by employees concerning matters within their duty may be admissible as statements of a party opponent if they're made during the employment relationship.

Wait, but the student isn't a party to the janitor's statement. Hmm. Alternatively, the janitor is an employee of the building owner. So, the janitor's statement to the owner (janitor's statement) would be an admission of a party opponent, because it's a statement by the building owner's employee concerning a matter within the scope of employment. So, under FRE 801(d)(2)(D), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's employee on a matter within the scope of employment and during the employment relationship.

So, in this case, the janitor's statement to the owner would be admissible as a statement of a party opponent. So, that's one layer.

Now, the second layer: the janitor's statement to the student. The janitor told the student, "I told her that running too fast is dangerous..." So, the statement is the janitor's warning to the student. If the owner is testifying about the janitor's statement, which includes the janitor's statement to the student, then that's another layer. So, the janitor's statement to the student would be hearsay within hearsay. So, unless both layers are covered by exceptions, the whole statement is inadmissible.

Wait, but the owner is testifying about what the janitor told him. The janitor's statement to the owner includes the janitor's statement to the student. So, the first layer is the janitor's statement to the owner, which is admissible as a party admission. The second layer is the janitor's statement to the student. Is that statement admissible? It depends on whether it's hearsay and if it has an exception.

The second layer would be the janitor telling the student that running is dangerous. That statement, offered for the truth, would be hearsay. So, unless it's covered by an exception, it's inadmissible. But the problem is, the owner is trying to get in the janitor's statement to him, which includes the statement to the student. So, perhaps the entire statement is inadmissible because the second layer (janitor to student) is hearsay without an exception.

Wait, but maybe the second layer is not for the truth of the matter asserted. If the owner is trying to prove that the janitor told him about the warning, but not necessarily that the warning was true. Wait, but in this case, the owner would be offering it to show that the janitor had warned the student, which would relate to the owner's knowledge or the student's assumption of risk. So, the owner is offering it for the truth of the matter asserted—the janitor did warn the student. So both layers would need to be admissible.

Alternatively, perhaps the second layer is not hearsay because it's not being offered for the truth. But I think it is, because the purpose is to show that the student was warned, which affects her claim of negligence against the owner.

So, in conclusion, since the statement is hearsay within hearsay, and only the first layer (janitor to owner) is admissible as a party admission, the second layer (janitor to student) would still be hearsay unless another exception applies. If no exception applies to the second layer, then the entire statement is inadmissible.

Looking back at the options, Option G says it's hearsay within hearsay with no exceptions. So that would make the statement inadmissible.

Alternatively, perhaps the second layer is a present-sense impression or an excited utterance. If the janitor's warning to the student was made while the student was running, perhaps in the heat of the moment, it could be an excited utterance. But the facts don't specify that. The janitor's warning was during the student's exercises, but we don't know the timing. So, it's possible, but not clear. Without that, we can't assume it's an excited utterance.

So, without an exception for the second layer, the entire statement is inadmissible. Therefore, the correct answer would be G: No, because it's hearsay within hearsay, and no exceptions apply.

Wait, but another possibility: the janitor's statement to the owner is being offered not for the truth of the matter asserted, but just to show that the owner knew about the warning. Wait, no, because the owner is trying to establish that the janitor warned the student, which would mean the owner had knowledge. So, the statement is still being offered for the truth.

Alternatively, perhaps the janitor's statement is admissible as a statement against interest. If the janitor's statement was against the building owner's interest, perhaps. But the janitor's statement is a warning, which might actually be in the owner's interest if it shows the owner took care. So, probably not a statement against interest.

Another angle: the building owner is testifying about a statement made by his employee (janitor) during employment. So, under FRE 801(d)(2)(D), the janitor's statement is not hearsay because it's an admission by a party opponent. So the first layer is admissible. But the second layer, the janitor's statement to the student, would still be hearsay. So, the entire statement would be inadmissible as hearsay within hearsay, unless the second layer also falls under an exception.

Wait, but maybe the second layer isn't being offered for the truth. Wait, no. The owner's statement is about what the janitor told him, which includes the janitor's warning to the student. So, the owner is offering it to prove that the janitor did warn the student, which would mean the owner had knowledge. So, the second layer is for the truth of the matter asserted.

If the second layer (janitor to student) is hearsay, and no exception applies, then the entire statement is inadmissible.

Looking at the options, option G says hearsay within hearsay, no exceptions. So the answer would be G.

Alternatively, option J says it's hearsay with no exceptions. But J doesn't address the hearsay within hearsay issue. So, G is more precise because it points out the dual hearsay problem.

Wait, but some might argue that the second layer isn't hearsay. For example, if the janitor's statement to the student is not for the truth, but just to show that the janitor gave a warning, which the owner knew about. But no, the purpose is to show that the warning was given, which is the truth of the matter.

Wait, perhaps the second layer is admissible under a different exception. Let me think: the janitor's statement to the student is a statement by the building's employee, so perhaps it's another admission by a party opponent. Because statements by employees within scope can be admissions. So, in that case, the second layer would also be admissible as an admission. So, if that's the case, both layers would be admissible as admissions, making the entire statement admissible.

Wait, but the student isn't a party to the current litigation. The party is the building owner. The janitor's statement to the student would be an admission by the building owner's employee, so under FRE 801(d)(2)(D), it's an admission and not hearsay. So, both layers would be admissible as admissions.

Wait, that's a good point. So, the first layer is the janitor telling the owner, which is an admission. The second layer is the janitor telling the student, which is also an admission because it's a statement by the employee within the scope of employment. So, both layers are admissions, so the entire statement is admissible.

But wait, the owner is testifying about the janitor's statement, which includes the janitor's statement to the student. So, the owner's testimony would be allowed because each layer is an admission.

But I thought that in such cases, both layers must qualify as admissions or fall under hearsay exceptions. So, if both layers are admissions, then the entire statement is admissible.

So, in that case, the building owner's testimony would be admissible, making the correct answer H, perhaps? Or maybe another option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option H: Yes, because the building owner can testify and be questioned about what the janitor told him.

But this seems more about the right to testify rather than the hearsay exception. But the issue is whether the content is admissible, not whether the owner can testify.

Wait, but if the statement is admissible as two layers of admissions, then the answer would be yes, it's admissible.

Looking at the options, the correct exception would be that both layers are admissions. So, perhaps the building owner's statement is admissible because each layer is an admission under 801(d)(2)(D).

Wait, but the options don't explicitly mention this. Let me review the options again.

Option D: Spontaneous declaration to opponent. Not applicable here.

Option F: Statement of existing mental condition. Doesn't fit.

Option G: Hearsay within hearsay, no exceptions. If both layers are admissions, then G is incorrect.

Option J: Hearsay with no exceptions. If both layers are admissions, J is incorrect.

Wait, so perhaps the correct answer is H, but H's reasoning isn't about hearsay exceptions. H says yes because the owner can testify about it. But that's not addressing the hearsay issue. The owner can testify, but the content might still be inadmissible due to hearsay.

So perhaps none of the options correctly state that both layers are admissions. Alternatively, maybe the janitor's statement to the owner is an admission, but the statement to the student isn't, making the entire thing inadmissible.

Wait, the janitor's statement to the student is an admission because it's a statement by the employee within the scope of employment. So, under 801(d)(2)(D), it's not hearsay. So, both layers are admissible as admissions. Therefore, the building owner's statement is admissible.

But looking at the options, none of them mention this. The closest is option H, but H doesn't address the hearsay issue. So perhaps the correct answer is H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the statement is admissible because the janitor's statement to the owner is an admission, and the statement to the student is not offered for the truth but just to show the owner's knowledge. But that doesn't make sense because the owner's knowledge is based on the truth of the janitor's warning.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The building owner is trying to testify about the janitor's statement. The janitor's statement is being offered to prove that the owner knew about the dangerous condition. So, the owner is using the janitor's statement as evidence of his own knowledge. 

But wait, the owner's knowledge would be based on the janitor's statement. So, if the janitor told the owner that he warned the student, then the owner knew about the danger. So, the janitor's statement is being offered for the truth—that the owner knew. Therefore, it's hearsay.

Unless the janitor's statement is an admission, which would make it non-hearsay. So, the janitor's statement to the owner is an admission by a party opponent, so it's admissible. But what about the janitor's statement to the student? That's another layer, but perhaps it's also an admission. So, both layers are admissible as admissions, making the entire statement admissible.

In that case, the answer would be yes, it's admissible. Looking at the options, the only option that says yes without addressing hearsay is H, but H's reasoning is about testifying, not the hearsay exception. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the building owner is a party, and the janitor is his employee. So, any
