Question:

What roles does glucose play in cellmetabolism ?

Options:

A: Glucose is used to create cell membranes and is not involved in energy storage
B: Glucose is converted directly into nucleic acids for cell replication
C: Glucose serves only as a secondary energy source when fats and proteins are not available
D: Glucose cannot be stored in cells
E: Glucose is the primary source of energy for plant cells, but not for animal cells
F: Glucose serves as the primary source of energy for all cells, can be converted to glycogen for storage, and can be converted into fat for later use.
G: Glucose can only be converted into protein for cell structure
H: Glucose is only stored in the form of fat
I: Glucose is only used for energy production
J: Glucose is exclusively used to synthesize amino acids and proteins

Okay, let's try to figure out the correct answer to this question about glucose's roles in cell metabolism. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through what I remember.

So the question is: What roles does glucose play in cell metabolism? And there are options from A to J.

First, I know that glucose is a simple sugar and a major energy source for cells. I remember that cells, especially in animals, rely heavily on glucose as their primary energy source. Plants make glucose through photosynthesis, so I think they use it a lot too.

Looking at the options one by one:

Option A: Glucose is used to create cell membranes and not involved in energy storage. Hmm, I don't think this is right. Cell membranes are made of lipids, like phospholipids, and proteins. Glucose isn't a component of cell membranes. Also, glucose is definitely involved in energy storage, like glycogen in animals or starch in plants. So A doesn't seem correct.

Option B: Converted directly into nucleic acids. I don't think so. Nucleic acids are made of nucleotides, which include sugars like deoxyribose or ribose, but not glucose. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: Only secondary when fats and proteins aren't available. Wait, I thought glucose is the primary energy source. Cells prefer using glucose first because it's a more efficient energy source. So when glucose is available, they use that before fats. So C might not be right because it says "only secondary", which doesn't fit.

Option D: Can't be stored in cells. That's incorrect because glycogen is a form of stored glucose in animals, and plants store it as starch. So D is wrong.

Option E: Primary for plant cells but not animal. No, I remember that both plants and animals use glucose as a primary energy source. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Primary source for all cells, can be stored as glycogen, and converted to fat. This sounds right. Glucose is the main energy source. When there's excess, the liver and muscles store it as glycogen. And if there's even more, the body can convert glucose into fat for longer-term storage. So F looks like a strong candidate.

Option G: Only converted to protein. No, that's not right. Glucose is mainly for energy, stored as glycogen or fat, not protein. So G is wrong.

Option H: Only stored as fat. No, because as I said, it's stored as glycogen too. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Only used for energy. Well, glucose can also be stored (like glycogen) and converted into fats. So I is too narrow. It's not only for energy.

Option J: Exclusively for amino acids and proteins. No, that's not right. Glucose is primarily for energy, not protein synthesis. So J is wrong.

Putting it all together, F seems to be the correct answer. It correctly states that glucose is the primary energy source, can be stored as glycogen, and converted into fat.

The correct answer is:

**F: Glucose serves as the primary source of energy for all cells, can be converted to glycogen for storage, and can be converted into fat for later use.**

This option accurately reflects the roles of glucose in cell metabolism. Glucose is the primary energy source for both plant and animal cells. It can be stored as glycogen in animals or starch in plants, and excess glucose can be converted into fat for long-term energy storage. Other options either misrepresent glucose's roles or are factually incorrect.

Answer: F
