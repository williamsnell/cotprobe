Okay, so I've got this question here about who the founder of Sikhism is, and I'm supposed to choose the correct option from A to J. I'm a bit rusty on my religious history, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Sikhism is one of the major religions and originated in India. The name "Sikh" comes from the Sanskrit word "shishya," meaning disciple. So, the founder must be the first guru, right? Because Sikhism is based on the teachings of ten gurus.

Wait, the ten gurus... I think the first one is Guru Nanak. Yeah, I've heard that name before. He was the founder. Then there were subsequent gurus after him, each adding to the teachings. So the options are all different gurus, but the first one would be the founder.

Looking at the options: Option E is Guru Nanak. The others are later gurus. For example, I remember Guru Gobind Singh was the tenth guru and he established the Khalsa, the Sikh brotherhood. So he's important but not the founder.

Guru Arjan was the fifth guru, I think. He compiled the Adi Granth, the holy scripture. So option A is not the founder. Guru Angad was the second guru, so he came after Nanak. So option B is Angad, but he's not the founder. Option C is Gobind Singh, as I mentioned.

So putting it all together, the founder is Guru Nanak, which is option E.

The founder of Sikhism is Guru Nanak, who is recognized as the first of the ten gurus and the originator of Sikh teachings. 

Answer: E
