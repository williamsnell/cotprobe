Okay, so I need to calculate the characteristic vibrational frequency of the lowest vibration state for H₂. Hmm, I remember that vibrational frequency relates to the force constant and the reduced mass of the molecule. But wait, what's the exact formula again?

Oh right, the formula for the vibrational frequency is given by ν = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/μ), where k is the force constant and μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms. So I need to find μ for H₂ and then plug in the values.

Hydrogen has an atomic mass of about 1 u (atomic mass unit). Since H₂ is a diatomic molecule, the reduced mass μ is (m1 * m2)/(m1 + m2). Both m1 and m2 are the mass of a hydrogen atom, so μ = (1*1)/(1+1) = 0.5 u.

Wait, but I need to convert that into kilograms because the other constants are in SI units. Oh yeah, 1 u is approximately 1.6605 × 10^-27 kg. So μ = 0.5 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 8.3025e-28 kg.

The force constant k is given as 5.1 newtons per cm. Oh wait, newtons per centimeter isn't SI units. I should convert that to N/m. There are 100 cm in a meter, so 5.1 N/cm = 5.1 * 100 N/m = 510 N/m.

Now, plug everything into the formula. ν = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/μ). Let's compute the values step by step.

First, calculate k/μ: 510 N/m divided by 8.3025e-28 kg. Let me compute that. 510 / 8.3025e-28 is approximately 6.14e30 (since 510 / 8.3 is about 61.4, and 61.4e30 is 6.14e31? Wait, wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 510 / 8.3025e-28 = 510 / (8.3025 × 1e-28) = (510 /8.3025) × 1e28. 510 divided by 8.3025 is approximately 61.4. So 61.4e28 = 6.14e29.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me think: 8.3025 times 61 is approximately 8*60=480, 0.3025*60=18.15, so 8.3025*61= approx 506.515. Oh, but I have 510, so 510/8.3025 ≈ 61.4 (since 8.3025 * 61.4 = 8.3025*(60 +1.4) = 498.15 + 11.635 = 509.785, which is close to 510). So yes, approximately 61.4, so k/μ is about 61.4e28 = 6.14e29.

Now take the square root of that. sqrt(6.14e29) = sqrt(6.14) * 1e14.5 (since sqrt(1e29) is 1e14.5). sqrt(6.14) is approximately 2.478. So 2.478e14.5, which is 2.478e14.5.

Wait, 1e14.5 is 1e14 * sqrt(10) ≈ 3.162e14. Alternatively, 1e14.5 = sqrt(10^29) = 10^(29/2) = 10^14.5, which is about 3.162e14. So 2.478 * 3.162e14 = approximately 7.83e14.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me correct that. Because 6.14e29 is 6.14 *10^29. So sqrt(6.14e29) = sqrt(6.14) * sqrt(1e29) = 2.478 * 1e14.5 = 2.478 * 3.162e14. Wait, no, 1e14.5 is 3.162e14. So 2.478 * 3.162e14 = let's compute 2.478 *3.162. 2.4 *3 is 7.2, 0.078 *3 is 0.234, so around 7.2+.234=7.434. Plus, 2.4 *0.162=0.3888. So total approx 7.434 +0.3888=7.8228. So about 7.823e14.

Wait, but 2.478 *3.162 is 2.478 *3 =7.434, plus 2.478 *0.162= approx 0.401, so total 7.434 +0.401 =7.835. So 7.835e14.

Then ν is (1/(2π)) * 7.835e14. So 2π is about 6.2832. So 7.835e14 /6.2832 ≈ (7.835 /6.2832) )e14.

Compute 7.835 /6.2832. Let's see, 6.2832 *1.25 is 7.854 (because 6*1.25=7.5, 0.2832*1.25≈0.354, so 7.854). So 7.835 is just slightly less than 1.25 times 6.2832. So approximately 1.2496 times.

So ν ≈ 1.2496e14 Hz, which is 1.25e14 sec^-1.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.25 ×10^14 sec^-1. So the answer should be B.

To calculate the characteristic vibrational frequency of the lowest vibration state for H₂, we use the formula:

\[
\nu = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}
\]

where \( k \) is the force constant and \( \mu \) is the reduced mass of the molecule.

1. **Reduced Mass (\( \mu \))**:  
   For H₂, the reduced mass is given by:  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{m_1 \cdot m_2}{m_1 + m_2}
   \]  
   Since both hydrogen atoms have the same mass (\( m_1 = m_2 = 1 \, \text{u} \)), we get:  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{1 \cdot 1}{1 + 1} = 0.5 \, \text{u}
   \]  
   Converting to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{u} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):  
   \[
   \mu = 0.5 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} = 8.3025 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg}
   \]

2. **Force Constant (\( k \))**:  
   The given force constant is \( k = 5.1 \, \text{N/cm} \). Converting to SI units (\( 1 \, \text{cm} = 0.01 \, \text{m} \)):  
   \[
   k = 5.1 \cdot 100 \, \text{N/m} = 510 \, \text{N/m}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( \nu \)**:  
   Substituting into the formula:  
   \[
   \nu = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}
   \]  
   First, compute \( \frac{k}{\mu} \):  
   \[
   \frac{k}{\mu} = \frac{510}{8.3025 \times 10^{-28}} \approx 6.14 \times 10^{29}
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}} = \sqrt{6.14 \times 10^{29}} \approx 7.835 \times 10^{14}
   \]  
   Now divide by \( 2\pi \) (\( 2\pi \approx 6.2832 \)):  
   \[
   \nu = \frac{7.835 \times 10^{14}}{6.2832} \approx 1.25 \times 10^{14} \, \text{sec}^{-1}
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:  
   Comparing with the options, the closest match is **B: \( 1.25 \times 10^{14} \, \text{sec}^{-1} \)**.
