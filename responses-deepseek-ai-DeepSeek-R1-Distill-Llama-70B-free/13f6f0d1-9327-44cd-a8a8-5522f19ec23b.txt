Okay, so I have this Laplace transform problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking me to find the inverse Laplace transform of 1 divided by [s times (s squared plus 1)], and to use the convolution method. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, right. The inverse Laplace transform, L^-1, of a function. I remember that the Laplace transform is linear, so maybe I can break this down into simpler parts. Oh wait, the function is 1/[s(s² +1)]. That looks like it could be split into partial fractions. Oh, but the question specifies using convolution, so maybe partial fractions are part of the process here.

Wait, convolution in Laplace transforms usually involves multiplying two functions and taking the inverse. Oh right, the convolution theorem says that L^{-1}[F(s)G(s)] = (f * g)(t), where * is the convolution operator. So, maybe I can express 1/[s(s² +1)] as the product of two simpler Laplace transforms, then apply the convolution theorem.

So, let me try to factor the denominator: s(s² +1) is s times (s² +1). So, F(s) could be 1/s and G(s) could be 1/(s² +1). Because when you multiply F(s) and G(s), you get 1/[s(s² +1)], which is exactly what we have.

Yes, that makes sense. So F(s) = 1/s, whose inverse Laplace transform I know is 1, because L{1} = 1/s. And G(s) is 1/(s² +1), whose inverse is sin(t), since L{sin(t)} = 1/(s² +1). 

So now, according to the convolution theorem, the inverse Laplace transform of F(s)G(s) is the convolution of f(t) and g(t). So f(t) is 1, and g(t) is sin(t). The convolution of 1 and sin(t) would be the integral from 0 to t of 1 * sin(τ) dτ.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. The convolution integral is ∫₀^t f(τ)g(t-τ) dτ. So in this case, f(τ) is 1, and g(t-τ) is sin(t-τ). So the integral becomes ∫₀^t 1 * sin(t - τ) dτ.

Hmm, integrating sin(t - τ) with respect to τ from 0 to t. Let me make a substitution to make this easier. Let u = t - τ. Then when τ = 0, u = t, and when τ = t, u = 0. Also, dτ = -du. So the integral becomes ∫ from u=t to u=0 of sin(u) (-du), which is the same as ∫ from 0 to t of sin(u) du.

The integral of sin(u) du is -cos(u). So evaluating from 0 to t gives [-cos(t)] - [-cos(0)] = -cos(t) + 1, since cos(0) is 1. So the result is 1 - cos(t).

Looking at the options, option B is 1 - cos t. So the inverse Laplace transform should be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any other steps I might have missed? Oh, wait, I used the convolution theorem correctly. F(s) is 1/s, G(s) is 1/(s² +1), their product is 1/[s(s² +1)], and the convolution gives 1 - cos(t). That seems correct.

Alternatively, I could have used partial fractions to solve this. Let me just try that method quickly to confirm. Let's express 1/[s(s² +1)] as A/s + (Bs + C)/(s² +1). Solving for A, B, and C.

Multiplying both sides by s(s² +1), we get 1 = A(s² +1) + (Bs + C)s.

Expanding the right-hand side: A s² + A + B s² + C s.

Combining like terms: (A + B)s² + C s + A.

Setting coefficients equal on both sides (left side is 1, which is 0s² + 0s +1):

A + B = 0 (coefficient of s²)
C = 0 (coefficient of s)
A = 1 (constant term)

So from A=1, B= -1. C=0.

So the expression becomes [1/s] + [(-s)/(s² +1)].

Now, taking the inverse Laplace of each term. The inverse of 1/s is 1. The inverse of (-s)/(s² +1) is -cos(t), because L{cos(t)} = s/(s² +1). So putting it together: 1 - cos(t), which matches what I got earlier using convolution. So that confirms the answer is 1 - cos(t), which is option B.

To find the inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{s(s^2 + 1)} \) using the convolution method, we proceed as follows:

1. **Express the given function as a product of two simpler Laplace transforms**:  
   Let \( F(s) = \frac{1}{s} \) and \( G(s) = \frac{1}{s^2 + 1} \). Then,  
   \[
   F(s)G(s) = \frac{1}{s(s^2 + 1)}.
   \]

2. **Find the inverse Laplace transforms of \( F(s) \) and \( G(s) \)**:  
   - The inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{s} \) is \( f(t) = 1 \).  
   - The inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{s^2 + 1} \) is \( g(t) = \sin(t) \).

3. **Apply the convolution theorem**:  
   The convolution theorem states that  
   \[
   \mathcal{L}^{-1}\{F(s)G(s)\} = (f * g)(t) = \int_0^t f(\tau)g(t-\tau) \, d\tau.
   \]  
   Substituting \( f(\tau) = 1 \) and \( g(t-\tau) = \sin(t-\tau) \), we get:  
   \[
   (f * g)(t) = \int_0^t \sin(t-\tau) \, d\tau.
   \]

4. **Evaluate the convolution integral**:  
   Using the substitution \( u = t - \tau \), the integral becomes:  
   \[
   \int_0^t \sin(u) \, du = -\cos(u) \Big|_0^t = -\cos(t) + \cos(0) = 1 - \cos(t).
   \]

5. **Verify using partial fractions (optional)**:  
   Expressing \( \frac{1}{s(s^2 + 1)} \) as \( \frac{A}{s} + \frac{Bs + C}{s^2 + 1} \), solving for \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), and taking the inverse Laplace transform confirms the result:  
   \[
   \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{1}{s(s^2 + 1)}\right\} = 1 - \cos(t).
   \]

Thus, the inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{s(s^2 + 1)} \) is \( 1 - \cos(t) \), which corresponds to **option B**.
