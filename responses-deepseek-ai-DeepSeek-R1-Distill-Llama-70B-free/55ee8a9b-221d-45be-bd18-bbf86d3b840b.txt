Okay, so I have this question about finding the magnitude of E for a plane wave in free space when the magnitude of H is given. Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that E and H are related through the intrinsic impedance of free space. Oh right, the formula is E = H * η, where η is the impedance.

Wait, what's the value of η in free space again? I think it's around 377 ohms. Oh yeah, because I remember the exact number is approximately 376.73 ohms. So η is about 376.7 ohms.

The problem says H is 5 amp/meter. So I need to multiply H by η to get E. Let me write that down: E = 5 A/m * 376.7 Ω. Wait, ohms are units of resistance, but here it's impedance, so it's the same unit. So 5 times 376.7 is... let me calculate that. 5 times 300 is 1500, 5 times 76 is 380, so 1500 + 380 is 1880. Wait, 376.7 times 5 is 1883.5, right? Because 376.7 is 376 and 0.7, so 376 *5 is 1880, and 0.7 *5 is 3.5, making it 1883.5. So E would be approximately 1883.5 volts per meter.

Looking at the options, option C is 1883 volts/meter, which matches my calculation. Option H is 376.7, which is η itself, so that's not it. Option J is 75 volts/meter, which doesn't make sense because that's much smaller. Option A is 1200, which is lower than our result. Option G is 600, also lower. Option D is 940, which is about twice 470, but not relevant here. Option E is 5 volts, which is way too low. Option B is 5 ohms, but we're looking for volts per meter. Option F is 1883 ohms, which would be η times H, but we're looking for E in volts, not impedance. So yeah, option C is correct.

To determine the magnitude of the electric field **E** for a plane wave in free space, we use the relationship:

\[
E = H \cdot \eta
\]

where \( \eta \) is the intrinsic impedance of free space, approximately \( 376.7 \, \Omega \). The problem states that \( H = 5 \, \text{A/m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
E = 5 \cdot 376.7 = 1883.5 \, \text{V/m}.
\]

From the given options, the closest match is **1883 volts/meter**, which corresponds to option **C**. Other options are either incorrect in magnitude or represent different quantities (e.g., impedance instead of electric field).
