Question:

A witness lived next door to a victim. Late one night, the witness overheard the victim scream, "The defendant, please don't do it!" The next day the victim was found dead in her bedroom. The defendant was arrested and charged with murdering the victim. At trial, the witness proposes to testify to the victim's statement. Upon objection by defendant's counsel, the court should rule the witness's testimony regarding the victim's statement

Options:

A: admissible as a past recollection recorded if the witness can confirm the statement was made.
B: admissible as a dying declaration if the jury determines that the victim believed that her death was imminent.
C: admissible as a dying declaration if the judge, by preponderance of the evidence, determines that the victim believed that her death was imminent.
D: inadmissible, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
E: inadmissible, because the statement was not made under oath.
F: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
G: inadmissible, because the statement is considered a character evidence.
H: admissible, because the statement is a present sense impression.
I: inadmissible, because the statement can lead to a character attack on the defendant.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let me read it carefully.

The scenario: A witness lives next door to a victim. One night, the witness hears the victim scream, "The defendant, please don't do it!" The next day, the victim is found dead. The defendant is charged with murder. At trial, the witness wants to testify about that statement, but the defense objects. The question is whether the court should admit this testimony.

The options are from A to I, each suggesting a different ruling.

First, I need to identify the issue. The witness is testifying about a statement made by the victim. Since the victim is dead, this is hearsay unless an exception applies.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. So the victim's statement is being offered to prove that the defendant did it, which is the truth. So it's hearsay.

Now, what exceptions apply here?

I remember that one exception is the dying declaration. Another is present sense impression, maybe excited utterance, and others like statements against interest.

Let me think about each possible exception.

Dying Declaration: This applies when the declarant is dead and the statement was made under the belief that death was imminent. But here, the victim was found dead the next day. When she made the statement, she might not have believed she was about to die. The scream was in the night, and she died the next day. So maybe she didn't think she was dying at the time of the statement.

Alternatively, the statement could be an excited utterance. That's when a statement is made under stress of a startling event. The scream suggests she was in distress, so maybe it's an excited utterance. Excited utterances don't require the declarant to be unavailable; they're admissible if they relate to the event while under the stress.

Wait, but excited utterance is under FRE 803(2). The statement must relate to the event and be made while under the stress. So if the scream was a reaction to an attack, that could qualify.

But another point: the statement is "The defendant, please don't do it!" That's identifying the perpetrator and suggesting an imminent action. So it might fit as an excited utterance.

Alternatively, present sense impression is when the statement describes an event made while perceiving it or immediately thereafter. So if she was making the statement as the event was happening, that could fit.

Wait, but the witness heard her scream. So the timing is important. If she was in the process of the event (like being attacked), then it's a present sense impression.

But the problem is that the victim is dead, so the statement's admissibility depends on whether it fits an exception.

Another possibility is that it's a statement of identification of a person made after perceiving him, under circumstances indicating trustworthiness. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, if the statement is offered not for the truth but to show the victim's state of mind, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. The prosecution would offer it to show that the defendant was the one committing the act.

So back to the exceptions. Dying declaration requires the declarant believed death was imminent. Here, the statement was made the night before she died. She might not have thought she was about to die then. So maybe dying declaration doesn't apply.

Excited utterance: The statement was made during a startling event (the attack) and while under stress. So it should qualify. But wait, the rule for excited utterance doesn't require the declarant to be unavailable, so it's admissible even if the declarant is dead.

Wait, but the options don't mention excited utterance. Let me look again.

Option H says admissible as a present sense impression. Option B and C are about dying declarations. Option F says inadmissible as hearsay with no exception.

Wait, present sense impression is 803(1): a statement describing an event made while the declarant was perceiving it or immediately thereafter. So if the victim was describing the attack as it happened, that could fit.

But the statement is "The defendant, please don't do it!" That's more of a plea than a description. So maybe not a present sense impression. Or maybe it's part of the event.

Alternatively, it could be an excited utterance, which is 803(2): a statement relating to a startling event made while under the stress of the excitement. That seems more applicable here.

But looking at the options, option H says "present sense impression." So if the statement is a present sense impression, then it's admissible.

Alternatively, excited utterance isn't one of the options. The options given are:

A: past recollection recorded.

B and C: dying declarations.

D: probative vs prejudice.

E: not under oath.

F: hearsay, no exception.

G: character evidence.

H: present sense.

I: character attack.

So, the options don't include excited utterance. So if that's the case, perhaps the correct exception is present sense impression.

Wait, but present sense impression is when the statement describes an event while perceiving it or immediately after. So if the victim was in the process of being attacked and made the statement, it could be a present sense impression.

Alternatively, it could be part of an excited utterance, but that's not an option here.

So the options don't have excited utterance. So perhaps the next best is present sense impression.

Wait, but in the options, H is present sense. So if the statement qualifies, then H would be correct.

Alternatively, maybe it doesn't fit any exception, making F correct.

Another angle: the statement is the victim identifying the defendant as the person committing the act. So it's a statement that would tend to subject the declarant to criminal liability, but that's for statements against interest.

Wait, statement against interest applies when the declarant's statement is against their own interest. Here, the statement accuses the defendant but doesn't directly incriminate the victim. So that exception might not apply.

So, considering all, perhaps the statement doesn't fit any exception, making it inadmissible hearsay.

Wait, but the options F is "inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception."

Alternatively, if it fits the excited utterance, but that's not an option. So if the options don't include excited utterance, then perhaps the correct answer is F.

Wait, but wait. The options don't include excited utterance, but they do include H as present sense impression.

So is the statement a present sense impression?

The statement was made while the event was happening. The victim was in the process of being attacked, perhaps, and screamed. So the statement describes what's happening at that moment. So it's a present sense impression.

Alternatively, present sense impression may require that the statement describe the event, but the statement here is more of a plea.

Hmm. Maybe it's a bit of a stretch. So without a better option, perhaps the statement doesn't fit an exception, making it inadmissible.

Wait, but in the options, option H is an exception. So if it can fit as a present sense impression, then it's admissible.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is not hearsay because it's not being offered for the truth. Wait, no, it's being offered to prove that the defendant did it, so it is for the truth.

Thus, without an exception, it's inadmissible. So the answer would be F.

But wait, let's think again. The statement could be an excited utterance. But since the option isn't present, perhaps it's F.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is a dying declaration. But the victim made the statement the night before she died, and she might not have believed she was dying at that time.

So for a dying declaration, the court (judge) must determine by a preponderance that the declarant believed death was imminent. So option C says that. But if the victim didn't believe she was dying, then it doesn't apply.

So in this case, the statement was made before she died, and perhaps she didn't think she was going to die. So the dying declaration exception wouldn't apply.

Thus, the statement is hearsay, and no exception applies, so it's inadmissible. So the answer would be F.

Wait, but let's think about the options again.

Option H: admissible as a present sense impression.

F: inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.

If the statement was made while the event was occurring, then it could be a present sense impression. So perhaps H is correct.

Wait, the statement is "The defendant, please don't do it!" That's a statement made while the event is happening. So perhaps it's a present sense impression.

Present sense impression can include statements that are part of the event. So if the victim was in the process of being attacked, and she made that statement, it's a present sense impression.

Therefore, the statement would be admissible under that exception.

So the answer would be H.

Alternatively, if it's not a present sense impression, then F.

But I think that H is more appropriate here because the statement was made during the event. So the correct answer would be H.

Wait, but the options are:

H: admissible, because the statement is a present sense impression.

Yes, so I think H is correct.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a statement made by the victim, "The defendant, please don't do it!" which the witness overheard on the night before the victim was found dead. The statement is being offered at trial, and the issue is whether it qualifies under a hearsay exception.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Since the victim is deceased, the statement is hearsay unless an exception applies. Several exceptions were considered:

1. **Dying Declaration (Options B and C):** This exception requires the declarant to believe that death was imminent when making the statement. However, the victim made the statement the night before her death, and there is no indication she believed death was imminent at that time. Thus, this exception does not apply.

2. **Excited Utterance:** While the statement could qualify as an excited utterance (made under the stress of a startling event), this option is not explicitly listed in the choices.

3. **Present Sense Impression (Option H):** This exception applies to statements describing an event made while the declarant was perceiving it or immediately thereafter. The victim's statement was made during the event (the attack), making it a strong candidate for this exception.

4. **Other Options:** Options A, D, E, G, and I were analyzed but do not apply to the facts of the case. Option F ("inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception") would only apply if no exception fits, but the statement qualifies as a present sense impression.

Given the analysis, the statement "The defendant, please don't do it!" was made during the event and describes the ongoing situation, making it admissible as a present sense impression under Option H.

**Answer: H**
