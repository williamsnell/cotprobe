Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about gender differences in conversation styles. The question is asking what research indicates about women compared to men in their conversational habits. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different behavior.

First, I'll try to recall what I know about this topic. I remember that there's been quite a bit of research on how men and women communicate differently. I think women are often found to use more verbal cues and perhaps show more engagement through non-verbal means.

Looking at the options:

A: Use more technical language. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think men might use more technical jargon in certain contexts, but I don't recall this being a general rule. Maybe in specific fields, but not overall.

B: Ask more questions. I think women are more likely to ask questions to engage others, so this might be correct. But I'm not certain.

C: Talk for longer periods. Wait, I think there's a stereotype that women talk more, but research might show otherwise. Or maybe it's context-dependent. I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

D: Speak in a higher pitch. That's a biological difference, not a conversational style, so probably not the right answer here.

E: Speak less frequently. Some studies suggest that in mixed groups, men might dominate conversations, so women might speak less. But I'm not sure if this is a general finding.

F: Make more eye contact. I remember reading that women are more likely to maintain eye contact during conversations, which is a sign of engagement. So this seems plausible.

G: Interrupt more often. I think men are more likely to interrupt others, so this would be the opposite of what the question is asking.

H: Use more body language. Women are often said to use more non-verbal cues, including body language, so this might be correct.

I: Make less eye contact. This contradicts option F, so probably not the case.

J: Use more fillers. I'm not sure. Maybe, but I don't have a strong recollection about this.

So now I need to narrow it down. The question is about what women do more than men. From what I remember, women tend to engage more with non-verbal cues. So options F and H are about eye contact and body language.

Wait, the question is about conversation style, which includes both verbal and non-verbal aspects. So making more eye contact (F) and using more body language (H) are both possible answers.

I think I've heard that women make more eye contact. But I also recall that women use more body language. So which one is correct?

Alternatively, thinking about fillers (J), I'm not certain. Maybe women use more, but I'm not sure.

Another point: I remember a study that showed women are more likely to ask questions to show interest, which supports option B.

But I'm not as confident about that. Alternatively, maybe women use more collaborative language, like asking questions to include others.

Wait, another thought: I think women are more likely to use more verbal affirmations, like "uh-huh" or "I see," which could be similar to using fillers. But fillers are more like "um" and "like," which might not be exactly the same.

So perhaps the answer is F or H, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B, as in asking more questions.

Wait, I think I've read that women are more likely to ask questions in a conversation to engage others, which would mean option B is correct. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, I'm more confident about the eye contact. I think women make more eye contact during conversations, so F would be correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused because there are multiple possible correct answers. Let me try to think of what the research actually says.

From what I recall, gender differences in communication often show that women are more likely to use supportive and collaborative language, which includes asking questions. So option B might be correct.

But another source I remember suggested that women make more eye contact. So F could also be correct.

Alternatively, some studies indicate that women use more verbal and non-verbal cues, which would encompass both. But the options given are separate.

Looking back at the options:

The question is which is correct based on research. So I need to pick the best answer.

I think the answer is F: make more eye contact. Because I remember reading that women tend to engage more with eye contact as a way to show attentiveness and build rapport.

Alternatively, another possibility is H: use more body language. But I'm not as certain about that. Or perhaps J: use more fillers. I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another angle: I think men are often found to interrupt more, so G is incorrect. Women might use more non-verbal cues, which includes body language, so H could be correct.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of other points. Some research suggests that women's speech includes more tentative language, like fillers, so J could be correct. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I remember that Deborah Tannen wrote about gender differences in communication. She mentioned that women use more "rapport-talk" which includes more eye contact, more questions, and more verbal feedback. So that would support options B and F.

But the question is asking which one is indicated by research. So perhaps both B and F are correct, but in the options, only one can be chosen.

Wait, the question says "the following" options, so perhaps the correct answer is F: make more eye contact.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H: use more body language.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think the most commonly cited difference is that women make more eye contact, so I'll go with F.

Research on gender differences in conversation styles suggests that women often exhibit distinct behaviors compared to men. Among the options provided, the most plausible answer based on common findings is that women make more eye contact during conversations. This aligns with the idea that women tend to use non-verbal cues, such as eye contact, to build rapport and show engagement. While other options like asking more questions (B) or using more body language (H) are also possible, the strongest evidence supports eye contact as a key difference.

Answer: F
