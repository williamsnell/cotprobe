Okay, so I have this math question in front of me, and I need to figure out which number has an absolute value greater than 5. Let me start by understanding what absolute value means. From what I remember, absolute value is the distance of a number from zero on the number line, without considering direction. So, whether the number is positive or negative, its absolute value is always positive or zero.

The question gives me options from A to J, each with a different number. I need to look at each option and calculate its absolute value to see if it's greater than 5.

Let me list out the options again to make sure I don't miss any:

A: 0
B: 2
C: -4
D: 3
E: 4
F: -2
G: -6
H: 5
I: -3
J: -5

Now, I'll go through each one by one.

Starting with option A, which is 0. The absolute value of 0 is 0. Well, 0 is not greater than 5, so A is out.

Option B is 2. The absolute value is 2, which is less than 5. So B doesn't qualify.

Option C is -4. The absolute value here is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, C isn't the answer.

Moving on to D, which is 3. Absolute value is 3. Again, less than 5, so D is no.

Option E is 4. Absolute value is 4. Still less than 5, so E doesn't make it.

Option F is -2. Absolute value is 2. Less than 5, so F is out.

Option G is -6. The absolute value would be 6. Ah, 6 is definitely greater than 5. So G is a candidate.

Option H is 5. The absolute value is exactly 5. But the question asks for greater than 5, not equal to. So H doesn't qualify.

Option I is -3. Absolute value is 3. Less than 5, so I is out.

Finally, option J is -5. The absolute value is 5. Again, same as H, it's equal to 5, not greater, so J doesn't make the cut.

So the only option left that meets the condition is G, which is -6 with an absolute value of 6. That makes sense because 6 is definitely greater than 5.

The number with an absolute value greater than 5 is -6.

Answer: G
