Okay, so I have this question about the 31P NMR spectrum of sodium phosphate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my NMR, but let me think this through.

The question says that a single line is seen in the 31P spectrum. Sodium phosphate in solution can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The two species given are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. Their chemical shifts are 3.42 ppm and 5.82 ppm, respectively. The question is asking what the chemical shift is when the pH equals the pKa of H2PO4^-.

Wait, pKa... Right, H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. I think the pKa refers to the second dissociation step of phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) has three pKa values. The first is around 2.1, the second around 7.2, and the third about 12.3. So if we're talking about the pKa of H2PO4^-, that would be the second one, pKa2, which is about 7.2.

When the pH equals the pKa, that's the point where the two species are in equilibrium. So at pH 7.2, both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- should be present in significant amounts. But wait, the NMR shows a single line. That implies that the two species are interconverting rapidly on the NMR timescale. So instead of seeing two separate peaks, we see an average.

So chemical shift averaging. The chemical shift observed would be the weighted average of the two shifts based on their concentrations. At pH=pKa, the concentrations of the two species are equal because the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation tells us that when pH=pKa, the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base to the acid is 1. So [HPO4^2-] = [H2PO4^-].

Therefore, the average shift would be (3.42 + 5.82) / 2. Let me calculate that: 3.42 +5.82 is 9.24. Divided by 2 is 4.62 ppm. So the chemical shift should be around 4.62.

Looking at the options, option H is 4.62 ppm. So the answer must be H.

When the pH of a sodium phosphate solution equals the pKa of H2PO4⁻ (approximately 7.2), the species H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ are in equilibrium, and their concentrations are equal. Due to rapid interconversion on the NMR timescale, the 31P NMR spectrum shows a single averaged chemical shift. The chemical shift is calculated as the weighted average of the shifts of the two species: 

\[
\text{Average shift} = \frac{3.42 \, \text{ppm} + 5.82 \, \text{ppm}}{2} = 4.62 \, \text{ppm}.
\]

Thus, the chemical shift at pH = pKa is 4.62 ppm, corresponding to option H.
