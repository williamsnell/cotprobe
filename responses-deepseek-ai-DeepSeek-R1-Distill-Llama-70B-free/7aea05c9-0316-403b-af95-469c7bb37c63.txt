Okay, so I've got this problem here about gases in a cylinder, and I need to find the mass of nitrogen added. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that there's an oxygen cylinder initially at 35 psia and 80°F, containing 0.9 lb of oxygen. Then, nitrogen is added to increase the pressure to 45 psia at the same temperature. I need to find how much nitrogen was added.

Wait, so the temperature is constant, right? Oh, right, same temperature. That probably means I can use the ideal gas law in some form here. Because when temperature is constant, some of those variables are easier to handle.

I remember that the ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V volume, n moles, R the gas constant, and T temperature. But wait, here we're dealing with mass instead of moles. Oh right, so maybe I should think in terms of mass and specific volumes or something like that.

Alternatively, there's this concept called the "combined gas law" or using the idea that when T is constant, P1V1 = P2V2. But wait, that's when the amount of gas is constant, right? Because n is the same. But in this case, we're adding more gas (nitrogen), so n is changing. So that approach might not work directly.

Wait, maybe I should split it into two parts: the initial state with just oxygen, and the final state with oxygen plus nitrogen. Oh right, because each gas contributes to the total pressure. So, each gas (O2 and N2) exerts a partial pressure based on their amounts.

Wait, I remember Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures. It says that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas in the mixture. So, P_total = P_O2 + P_N2.

But how do I find each partial pressure? Well, each partial pressure is based on the amount (moles) of each gas. So for each gas, P_i = (n_i R T)/V, right? So the partial pressure of O2 would be (n_O2 R T)/V, and similarly for N2.

But wait, in the initial state, before adding N2, the pressure is 35 psia. That's just from O2. So I can find the moles of O2 initially, and then when N2 is added, the total pressure is 45 psia.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the initial moles of O2 when the pressure is 35 psia.
2. After adding N2, the total pressure is 45 psia, which is the sum of the partial pressures of O2 and N2.
3. The volume of the cylinder remains constant, and the temperature is the same, so I can relate the moles before and after.

Wait, but how about the volume? Hmm, the problem doesn't give me the volume of the cylinder. That's a problem. Because without knowing V, I can't directly compute n. But wait, maybe the volume cancels out because it's the same in both cases.

Let me try to model this.

Let me denote:

Initial state (only O2):
P1 = 35 psia
n1 = moles of O2 = mass of O2 / molar mass of O2.

Molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol, which is 0.03223 lb/mol (since 1 lb is 453.592 grams). Wait, wait, 0.9 lb is given as the mass of O2. Oh, right, because 1 lb is about 453.592 grams, so 32 g/mol is 0.0704 lb/mol? Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, molar mass of O2 is (16 g/mol * 2) = 32 g/mol. Converting grams to pounds: 1 lb = 453.59237 grams. So 32 grams is 32 / 453.592 ≈ 0.07054 lb per mole.

So, mass of O2 is 0.9 lb. Moles of O2, n_O2_initial = 0.9 lb / 0.07054 lb/mol ≈ let me compute that. 0.9 / 0.07054 is approximately 12.75 moles.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.07054 lb/mol is the molar mass. So 0.9 divided by 0.07054.

Let me compute 0.9 / 0.07054.

Well, 0.07054 * 12 = 0.84648, and 0.07054*12.75 = 0.07054*(12 + 0.75) = 0.84648 + 0.052905 = 0.899385 lb. Hmm, that's close to 0.9. So n_O2_initial ≈ 12.75 moles.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more precisely.

n_O2_initial = 0.9 / 0.07054 ≈ 12.75 moles. Let's say approximately 12.75 moles of O2.

Now, when N2 is added, the pressure increases. The total pressure is 45 psia. Let me consider the moles of O2 and N2 after adding.

Let me denote:

n_O2 = 12.75 moles (since we're not adding or removing O2, just adding N2)
n_N2 = ? (moles of N2 added)

So, the total pressure is P_total = P_O2 + P_N2.

Each partial pressure is given by (n_i R T)/V, but since V and T are the same for both, and R is a constant, I can write P_i proportional to n_i.

But since the volume V is the same before and after, perhaps I can find the ratio.

Wait, I think I can model this as:

In the initial state, P_initial = P_O2_initial = n_O2_initial * R T / V.

In the final state, P_final = P_O2_final + P_N2_final.

But since the amount of O2 doesn't change, P_O2_final = P_O2_initial. Wait, no, that's only if the volume changes. Wait, no, because if the volume is the same and the temperature is the same, the partial pressure of O2 would remain the same as before, because n_O2 hasn't changed. Oh wait, that's right.

Wait, no, that's only if the volume stays the same. Since the cylinder's volume is fixed, adding N2 doesn't change the volume. So the partial pressure of O2 remains the same as before, because n_O2 is the same, T is same, V same. So P_O2 = (n_O2 R T)/V = 35 psia. So the partial pressure of O2 is 35 psia in both cases.

Then, the partial pressure of N2 is P_N2 = P_total - P_O2 = 45 psia - 35 psia = 10 psia.

So, P_N2 = 10 psia.

Now, using the ideal gas law, P_N2 = (n_N2 R T)/V.

But from the initial state, we can write P_initial = (n_O2_initial R T)/V = 35 psia.

So, R T / V = P_initial / n_O2_initial.

Similarly, for P_N2 = (n_N2 R T)/V = 10 psia.

So substituting R T/V from the initial condition into the equation for P_N2:

10 psia = n_N2 * (P_initial / n_O2_initial) )

So, solving for n_N2:

n_N2 = (10 psia * n_O2_initial) / P_initial.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

n_N2 = (10 psia * 12.75 moles) / 35 psia.

So, 10/35 is 2/7, so 12.75 * (2/7) = ?

12.75 * 2 = 25.5, divided by 7 is approximately 3.642857 moles of N2.

Wait, that's a way to find n_N2. Then, the mass of N2 added would be n_N2 multiplied by the molar mass of N2.

Molar mass of N2 is 28 g/mol, which is 0.06299 lb/mol (since 28 g /453.592 g/lb ≈ 0.0618 lb/mol).

So, mass_N2 = n_N2 * molar_mass_N2 = 3.642857 moles * 0.06299 lb/mol.

Let me compute that.

3.642857 * 0.06299.

Let me compute 3.6 * 0.063 = 0.2268, and 0.042857 * 0.063 ≈ 0.0027. So total around 0.2295 lb.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

3.642857 * 0.06299.

Let me compute it as:

3.642857 * 0.06299 = let's see.

3.642857 * 0.06 = 0.218571

3.642857 * 0.00299 = ?

Well, 3.642857 * 0.002 = 0.0072857

3.642857 * 0.00099 = approximately 3.642857 * 0.001 = 0.003642857, but subtract 10% of that (since 0.00099 is 0.001 - 0.00001). So 0.003642857 - 0.00003642857 = 0.00360642857.

Adding those two components: 0.0072857 + 0.0036064 ≈ 0.0108921.

So total is 0.218571 + 0.0108921 ≈ 0.229463 lb.

Looking at the options, I see option E is 0.115 lb, option B is 0.225, option I is 0.02813, etc.

Wait, 0.229 is closest to 0.225 lb, which is option B. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me double-check my steps.

Wait, when I found n_N2 as 3.642857 moles, then multiplied by 0.06299 lb/mol.

Wait, 3.642857 * 0.06299.

Let me compute this exactly.

3 * 0.06299 = 0.18897.

0.642857 * 0.06299.

Compute 0.6 * 0.06299 = 0.037794.

0.042857 * 0.06299 ≈ 0.002700.

So total 0.037794 + 0.002700 ≈ 0.040494.

Adding to 0.18897: 0.18897 + 0.040494 ≈ 0.229464 lb.

So approximately 0.2295 lb.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option B: 0.225 lb. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation.

Wait, let's go back. n_N2 = (10 * 12.75) / 35.

10/35 is 2/7, so 12.75 * 2 = 25.5; 25.5 /7 = 3.642857 moles. That part seems correct.

Molar mass of N2: 28 g/mol is 28 /453.592 lb/mol.

Wait, 28 grams is 0.0618 lb. Hmm, 28 /453.592 = approximately 0.0618 lb/mol.

So 3.642857 moles * 0.0618 lb/mol.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.642857 * 0.0618.

Let me compute 3.642857 * 0.06 = 0.218571.

3.642857 * 0.0018 = 0.0065547.

Adding those: 0.218571 + 0.0065547 ≈ 0.225126 lb.

Wait, that's about 0.2251 lb, which aligns with option B (0.225 lb).

So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but earlier I had 0.229 when using 0.06299. Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated the molar mass.

Wait, 28 grams is 28 / 453.59237 grams per pound.

28 ÷ 453.59237 = approximately 0.0618 lb.

Yes, so 3.642857 moles * 0.0618 lb/mol = 0.2251 lb, which is 0.225 lb as in option B.

So the answer should be B: 0.225 lb.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the initial and final states of the system using the ideal gas law and Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures. The cylinder initially contains only oxygen at 35 psia and 80°F, with a mass of 0.9 lb. The molar mass of oxygen is 32 g/mol, or approximately 0.07054 lb/mol. The initial moles of oxygen are calculated as:

\[
n_{\text{O}_2} = \frac{\text{mass of O}_2}{\text{molar mass of O}_2} = \frac{0.9 \, \text{lb}}{0.07054 \, \text{lb/mol}} \approx 12.75 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After nitrogen is added, the total pressure increases to 45 psia, while the temperature and volume remain constant. Using Dalton's Law, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of oxygen and nitrogen:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{O}_2} + P_{\text{N}_2}.
\]

The partial pressure of oxygen remains constant at 35 psia because the amount of oxygen does not change. Thus, the partial pressure of nitrogen is:

\[
P_{\text{N}_2} = P_{\text{total}} - P_{\text{O}_2} = 45 \, \text{psia} - 35 \, \text{psia} = 10 \, \text{psia}.
\]

Using the ideal gas law, the moles of nitrogen can be calculated as:

\[
n_{\text{N}_2} = \frac{P_{\text{N}_2} V}{R T}.
\]

Since the volume \(V\) and temperature \(T\) are constant, the ratio of pressures is proportional to the ratio of moles. Using the initial moles of oxygen:

\[
n_{\text{N}_2} = \frac{P_{\text{N}_2}}{P_{\text{O}_2}} \cdot n_{\text{O}_2} = \frac{10 \, \text{psia}}{35 \, \text{psia}} \cdot 12.75 \, \text{mol} \approx 3.643 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The mass of nitrogen added is then calculated using its molar mass, which is 28 g/mol or approximately 0.0618 lb/mol:

\[
\text{mass of N}_2 = n_{\text{N}_2} \cdot \text{molar mass of N}_2 = 3.643 \, \text{mol} \cdot 0.0618 \, \text{lb/mol} \approx 0.225 \, \text{lb}.
\]

Thus, the mass of nitrogen added is approximately **0.225 lb**, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
