Okay, so I've got this psychology ethics question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a 35-year-old patient tells their psychologist that they've molested a nine-year-old child. And this isn't the first time they've done something like this. So, the psychologist has to decide what to do next.

Hmm, I remember that psychologists have a duty to protect others, especially when there's a risk of harm. There's something called the Tarasoff rule, right? That's when a therapist has to warn or protect potential victims if the patient is a danger to others. But wait, in this case, the molestation has already happened. So the immediate danger might be to other children if the patient continues this behavior.

Wait, but the question is about the appropriate action. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Inform the patient's family first. That doesn't seem right. The family might not be the ones in danger, and the psychologist's duty is to protect the potential victims, not necessarily the patient's family. Plus, involving the family could lead to other issues without addressing the immediate risk to children.

Option B: Seek advice from a professional ethics committee. That might be a good idea, but I think in urgent situations, the psychologist can't wait for a committee's input. They need to act quickly to prevent further harm.

Option C: Discuss further in therapy without involving authorities. No, that can't be right. If the patient is a danger to others, confidentiality can be broken to protect them. Just talking about it in therapy doesn't stop the risk.

Option D: Notify child protection services without telling the patient. That's a possibility. But I think the standard practice is to inform the patient when you're breaching confidentiality, unless it would cause harm or the patient might destroy evidence or something.

Option E: Notify authorities immediately and inform the patient. That sounds correct. The psychologist should report the situation to the appropriate authorities to prevent further harm and also let the patient know they're doing so. It's about balancing confidentiality with the duty to protect.

Option F: Encourage the patient to turn themselves in. While that's a possibility, the psychologist can't just rely on the patient to do the right thing, especially since the patient has a history of this behavior. They might not follow through, leaving children at risk.

Option G: Warn the patient to stop or else be reported. I'm not sure. This might give the patient an ultimatum, but if the patient continues, the psychologist would have to report. But the problem is, the molestation has already happened, so the immediate step is to report to protect others, not just warn.

Option H: Handle within therapy and maintain confidentiality. Definitely not. Confidentiality doesn't apply when there's a clear and imminent danger to others.

Option I: Inform the child's parents first. That could make sense because the parents need to protect their child. But I think the primary responsibility is to report to the authorities, like child protection services, who can investigate and take appropriate action. Informing the parents might be a part of that process, but the psychologist's duty is to report to the authorities, not just the parents.

Option J: Keep it confidential. No way. Confidentiality ends when there's a risk of serious harm to others. The patient's actions clearly pose a risk, so confidentiality must be broken.

So, putting it all together, the psychologist should notify the authorities immediately and inform the patient about this action. That's option E. It respects the patient's awareness of the breach of confidentiality while taking necessary steps to protect potential victims.

The psychologist is faced with a situation where a patient admits to molesting a child, with a history of such behavior. The psychologist's duty is to protect potential victims, as confidentiality is overridden when there is a risk of serious harm to others. 

Option E is the correct choice because it involves notifying the authorities immediately to prevent further harm and informing the patient of this action, which is both ethical and legally appropriate. This approach balances the need to protect others with the obligation to inform the patient about the breach of confidentiality.
