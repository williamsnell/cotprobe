Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about heritability in fruit flies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says that the mean number of abdominal bristles in a population of Drosophila melanogaster is 38. Then, they selected flies that have an average of 42.8 bristles to breed the next generation. The F1 generation ended up with a mean of 40.6 bristles. The question is asking for the heritability of this trait.

Wait, heritability... Right, heritability is the proportion of the variation in a trait that is due to genetic differences in the population. But wait, isn't there a specific formula for calculating heritability in the context of selective breeding? Oh right, I think it's Heritability (h²) = R / S, where R is the response to selection and S is the selection differential.

So, let's break it down. The selection differential (S) is the difference between the mean of the selected parents and the mean of the original population. The original population mean is 38, and the selected flies have 42.8. So S = 42.8 - 38 = 4.8.

The response to selection (R) is the difference between the mean of the offspring (F1) and the mean of the original population. The F1 mean is 40.6, so R = 40.6 - 38 = 2.6.

Wait, wait, wait. No, I think I might have gotten that wrong. Because the F1 is the result of the parents being selected, so perhaps R is F1 mean minus the original mean. Yeah, I think that's correct.

So plugging the numbers in: R is 40.6 - 38 = 2.6. S is 4.8. So h² = 2.6 / 4.8. Let me calculate that.

2.6 divided by 4.8. Let me do the division. 2.6 ÷ 4.8. Well, 4.8 goes into 2.6 about 0.54 times. Because 4.8 * 0.5 is 2.4, and 2.6 - 2.4 is 0.2. So 0.2 /4.8 is about 0.041666. So total is 0.5 + 0.041666, which is approximately 0.541666... So around 0.54.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.54. So the heritability is 0.54.

Wait, but wait another moment. Did I get R correct? Because sometimes I might confuse R. So let me think again: the selection differential is the difference in the parental generation. The response is the change in the offspring. So yes, R is F1 mean minus original population mean, which is correct.

So yeah, 2.6 /4.8 is 0.54. So the answer should be G.

To calculate the heritability of the trait, we use the formula:

\[
h^2 = \frac{R}{S}
\]

Where:
- \( R \) (response to selection) is the difference between the mean of the F₁ generation and the mean of the original population.
- \( S \) (selection differential) is the difference between the mean of the selected parents and the mean of the original population.

### Step 1: Calculate \( S \) (selection differential)
The original population mean is 38, and the selected parents have a mean of 42.8. Thus:

\[
S = 42.8 - 38 = 4.8
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( R \) (response to selection)
The mean of the F₁ generation is 40.6, and the mean of the original population is 38. Thus:

\[
R = 40.6 - 38 = 2.6
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( h^2 \)
Using the formula:

\[
h^2 = \frac{R}{S} = \frac{2.6}{4.8} \approx 0.54
\]

### Final Answer:
The heritability of the trait is approximately **0.54**, which corresponds to option **G**.
