Okay, I'm trying to figure out this problem about Mr. Castle choosing between two motors. Hmm, so the question is about finding the number of hours per year where the total cost of both motors will be the same. I remember that when comparing costs over time, especially with energy efficiency involved, I need to consider both the initial cost and the operating costs.

Wait, so there are two motors, A and B. Motor A costs $169 and has an efficiency of 85.2%, while Motor B is cheaper at $149 but less efficient at 82.1%. The annual inspection and maintenance fee is 14.5% of the motor's price. Also, electricity costs 2.35 cents per kilowatt-hour, and 1 HP is 0.746 kW. 

I think I should break this down into total cost equations for each motor. The total cost for each motor would be the sum of the initial cost (plus maintenance) and the energy costs over time. Since the question is asking for when these costs are equal, I can set the two total cost equations equal to each other and solve for the number of hours.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the annual ownership cost, which includes the initial price plus the maintenance fee. Wait, the maintenance is 14.5% of the price, so for each motor, it's (price) * 1.145. Because it's 100% of the cost plus 14.5% maintenance.

Wait, but I think the maintenance is an annual fee. So the total cost each year is (price * 0.145) for maintenance, plus the initial purchase price? Or is the initial price a one-time cost, and the maintenance is annual? Hmm, I think the initial cost is a one-time expense, so maybe it's better to consider the total cost over the period of operation. Wait, but the problem states that the motors are being bought, so the initial cost is a one-time expense, and the maintenance is an annual expense. So the total cost is initial cost + (annual maintenance + annual energy cost) multiplied by the number of years. But wait, the problem is asking for the number of hours per year at which the costs are the same. So maybe we can model it as total cost after t years, but perhaps it's easier to calculate on a yearly basis, assuming operation for t hours per year.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the equations for the total cost for each motor as a function of the number of hours they operate in a year. So for each motor, the total cost is the initial cost (price) plus the sum of annual costs, which include the maintenance fee and the energy cost.

But wait, the initial cost is a one-time payment. So if the motors are used for T years, the initial cost is spread out over that time. But the question is about the number of hours per year, so maybe we can consider the cost per year, including the initial cost amortized over the time. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the total cost as initial cost plus annual costs, and find when the sum equals.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the "break-even" point where the total costs for both motors are the same for a single year of operation. Because otherwise, if it's over multiple years, we might need to know the lifespan or discount rates, which aren't given here. So I'll proceed under the assumption that we're looking for the number of hours in a year where the total cost (initial + maintenance + energy) for both motors is equal.

Wait, but the initial cost is a one-time payment. So for each motor, the total cost after one year would be initial cost + (maintenance fee for the year) + (energy cost for the year). But we need to see when this total is the same for both motors.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total cost over the life of the motor, but without knowing the lifespan, maybe it's just the first year. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The problem asks for the number of hours per year at which the cost of both motors will be the same. So perhaps it's the total cost each motor incurs in a year, including initial cost and operating costs for that year. But the initial cost is a one-time expense, so perhaps it's better to model it as the cost per year, including the initial cost as a depreciation expense, but I don't think that's the approach here. Maybe the problem is considering the initial cost as a sunk cost, and the rest as annual costs, but that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the initial cost as a one-time expense, and the maintenance and energy as annual recurring expenses. So the total cost after t years would be initial cost + t*(maintenance + energy cost). But since the question is about the number of hours per year, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the "cost" here refers to the initial plus the annual costs for that year, and we are to find the hours where, for that year, the costs are equal.

Wait, maybe it's better to model each motor's total cost as the initial cost plus the annual operating cost, which includes both the maintenance fee and the energy cost, and find the number of hours where the total for each equals.

Let me try to model this.

Total Cost for Motor A = Initial Cost A + (Maintenance Fee A + Energy Cost A per year)
Similarly for Motor B.

But since the initial cost is a one-time payment, perhaps we should consider it as part of the cost in the first year. So for the first year, the total cost for Motor A is $169 (initial) + (0.145 * 169) (maintenance) + (energy cost in the first year).

Wait, the maintenance fee is 14.5% of the price each year. So for Motor A, maintenance each year is 0.145 * 169, and same for Motor B.

The energy cost depends on the number of hours the motor operates, its efficiency, and the electricity cost.

So, the energy cost for each motor would be:

Energy Cost = (Power in kW) * (number of hours) * (electricity cost per kWh) / efficiency

Wait, because efficiency is the ratio of output power to input power. So the input power (electricity used) would be the output power divided by efficiency.

Wait, 1 HP is 0.746 kW. So a 10 HP motor outputs 10 * 0.746 kW. But wait, is that correct? 10 HP is 10 * 0.746 = 7.46 kW. That's the output power. The input power would be higher because of inefficiency. So Input Power = Output Power / Efficiency.

So for Motor A, Input Power = (10 * 0.746) / 0.852. Similarly for Motor B.

Wait, but the efficiency is given as full-load efficiency. So at full load, the motor uses that efficiency.

So for each motor, when it's running, it's using a certain amount of electricity, which depends on its efficiency.

So, the energy cost per hour for each motor is:

Motor A: (10 HP * 0.746 kW/HP) / 0.852 efficiency * cost per kWh.

But wait, the cost per kWh is 2.35 cents, which is $0.0235.

So for each motor, the energy cost per hour is:

Motor A: (7.46 kW) / 0.852 * 0.0235 dollars.

Similarly, Motor B: 7.46 kW / 0.821 * 0.0235.

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, 10 HP is 7.46 kW output. So input power is 7.46 / efficiency.

Wait, efficiency is in decimal, so 85.2% is 0.852, 82.1% is 0.821.

So for each hour, Motor A uses 7.46 / 0.852 kW.

Multiply by the cost: 7.46 / 0.852 * 0.0235.

Similarly for Motor B: 7.46 / 0.821 * 0.0235.

Wait, but that gives the energy cost per hour. Then, for h hours per year, the energy cost is h * (that value).

So putting it all together, the total cost for each motor in a year would be:

Motor A: Initial Cost + Maintenance Fee + (Energy Cost per hour * h)
Motor B: Initial Cost + Maintenance Fee + (Energy Cost per hour * h)

Wait, no, because the initial cost is a one-time payment. So for the first year, the total cost is initial cost + maintenance fee + energy cost. But if we're looking for when the total costs (including initial) are the same, then perhaps the initial cost is included in the first year only. Alternatively, if we're considering the motors being used for T years, the initial cost would be spread over T years, but the problem doesn't specify T. Hmm.

Wait, the problem is asking for the number of hours per year where the cost of both motors will be the same. So perhaps it's considering the annual cost, including the initial cost as a one-time expense in the first year. So for each motor, the total cost in the first year would be initial cost + maintenance fee + energy cost. And we're to find when this total is the same for both motors.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the present value of all future costs, but without discounting, that's complicated. I think the intended approach is to compute the total cost in the first year, and find when they are equal.

So let's proceed with that.

Compute for each motor, the total cost in the first year, which is:

Total Cost A = Price A + (0.145 * Price A) + (Energy Cost A for h hours)

Similarly,

Total Cost B = Price B + (0.145 * Price B) + (Energy Cost B for h hours)

We want Total Cost A = Total Cost B, solve for h.

So,

169 + 0.145*169 + (h * energy cost A) = 149 + 0.145*149 + (h * energy cost B)

Let me compute each part.

First, compute the maintenance fees.

Motor A maintenance: 0.145 * 169 = let's see, 169 * 0.145.

169 * 0.1 = 16.9
169 * 0.04 = 6.76
169 * 0.005 = 0.845
Total: 16.9 + 6.76 = 23.66 + 0.845 = 24.505.

So maintenance for A is $24.505.

Similarly for Motor B: 0.145 * 149.

149 * 0.1 = 14.9
149 * 0.04 = 5.96
149 * 0.005 = 0.745
Adding up: 14.9 +5.96=20.86 +0.745=21.605.

So maintenance for B is $21.605.

Now, the energy cost per hour:

For Motor A: (7.46 kW / 0.852) * 0.0235 $/kWh.

Compute 7.46 / 0.852.

Let me calculate: 0.852 * 8.76 ≈ 7.46 (since 0.852*8=6.816, 0.852*0.76≈0.647, total ~7.463). So 7.46 / 0.852 ≈ 8.76.

So 8.76 kW. Multiply by 0.0235: 8.76 * 0.0235.

Let's compute 8 * 0.0235 = 0.188, 0.76 * 0.0235 ≈ 0.01786. So total ≈ 0.188 + 0.01786 = 0.20586 dollars per hour.

So Motor A's energy cost is approximately $0.20586 per hour.

For Motor B: 7.46 / 0.821. Let me compute that.

0.821 * 9.1 = approx 7.46. Let me check: 0.821 *9 = 7.389, 0.821 *0.1=0.0821, so 7.389+0.0821=7.4711, which is close to 7.46. So 7.46/0.821 ≈9.091.

So 9.091 kW. Multiply by 0.0235: 9.091 * 0.0235.

Compute 9 * 0.0235 = 0.2115, 0.091 * 0.0235 ≈ 0.0021385. So total ≈0.2115 +0.0021385=0.21364 dollars per hour.

So Motor B's energy cost is approximately $0.21364 per hour.

Now, the energy cost for h hours:

Motor A: 0.20586 * h
Motor B: 0.21364 * h

Now, the total costs for the first year:

Total A = 169 + 24.505 + 0.20586 * h
Total B = 149 + 21.605 + 0.21364 * h

Set them equal:

169 +24.505 +0.20586 h = 149 +21.605 +0.21364 h

Compute the constants:

169 +24.505 = 193.505
149 +21.605=170.605

So equation becomes:

193.505 +0.20586 h = 170.605 +0.21364 h

Bring variables to one side and constants to the other:

193.505 - 170.605 = 0.21364 h -0.20586 h

Compute left side: 193.505 -170.605 = 22.9

Right side: (0.21364 -0.20586) h = 0.00778 h

So:

22.9 = 0.00778 h

Solve for h:

h = 22.9 / 0.00778 ≈ ?

Compute that.

22.9 divided by 0.00778.

Well, 1 / 0.00778 ≈128.57 (since 0.00778 is approx 1/128.57).

So 22.9 * 128.57 ≈ let's compute:

22 * 128.57 = 2828.54
0.9 * 128.57≈115.713
Total ≈2828.54 +115.713=2944.25 hours.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the options are all in the hundreds, like 300 to 600 hours.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in my calculations somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the energy cost per hour. Let me double-check.

Wait, let's compute the energy cost more accurately.

For Motor A:

Input power = 10 HP * 0.746 kW/HP =7.46 kW.

Efficiency is 85.2% =0.852.

So input power in kW is 7.46 / 0.852 = let's compute 7.46 ÷ 0.852.

Let me do this calculation accurately.

0.852 * 8.76 =?

0.852 *8=6.816, 0.852*0.76=0.64752. Sum is 6.816 +0.64752=7.46352, which is a bit higher than 7.46. So 8.76 - perhaps a bit less.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute it as 7.46 / 0.852.

7.46 ÷ 0.852.

Let me compute 0.852 × 8.76 = 7.46 (as above), so 7.46 /0.852 =8.76.

So the input power is 8.76 kW.

Energy cost per hour is 8.76 kW * 0.0235 $/kWh = 8.76 * 0.0235.

8 * 0.0235=0.188.

0.76 *0.0235=0.01786.

Sum is 0.20586 dollars per hour. So that seems correct.

Motor B: 7.46 / 0.821.

Let me compute 7.46 ÷ 0.821.

0.821 ×9=7.389.

7.46 -7.389=0.071.

So 0.071 ÷0.821 ≈0.0864.

So 9.0864.

So input power is approximately 9.0864 kW.

So energy cost per hour is 9.0864 *0.0235.

Compute 9 * 0.0235=0.2115, 0.0864 *0.0235≈0.002029. Sum is 0.213529, approximately 0.21353 dollars per hour.

So the energy cost per hour for A is 0.20586, and for B it's 0.21353.

Then, the equation is:

(169 +24.505) +0.20586 h = (149 +21.605) +0.21353 h

Wait, 169 +24.505 =193.505

149 +21.605=170.605

So equation is 193.505 +0.20586 h = 170.605 +0.21353 h

Subtract 170.605 from both sides:

193.505 -170.605 = (0.21353 -0.20586) h

22.9 =0.00767 h

So h= 22.9 /0.00767 ≈?

Let me compute 22.9 ÷0.00767.

Well, 0.00767 is approximately 1/130.85.

So 22.9 *130.85 ≈ ?

22 *130.85= 2878.7, 0.9*130.85≈117.765, sum≈2878.7+117.765=2996.465 hours.

Wait, that's about 2996 hours per year. But that's way more than any of the options given, which are all under 600 hours.

Hmm, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the initial cost. Perhaps instead of adding the initial cost as a one-time expense, I should consider it as a part of the annual cost. But that doesn't make sense because the initial cost is a one-time payment.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the initial cost as a one-time expense, and then the maintenance and energy costs are annual. So the total cost each year is maintenance plus energy cost. But then the initial cost would make the first year more expensive. But the question is about when the costs are the same, so perhaps it's over the life of the motor, but without knowing how many years, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the initial cost as
