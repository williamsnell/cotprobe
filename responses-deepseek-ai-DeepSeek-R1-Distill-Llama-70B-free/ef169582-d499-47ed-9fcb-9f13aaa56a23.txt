Okay, so I've got this question about tax structures, and I need to figure out whether the system described is progressive, proportional, or regressive. Let me try to break it down.

First, the question gives me two individuals: Mr. Gribbone and Mr. Doyle. Mr. Gribbone earns $10,000 annually and pays $1,500 in taxes. That means his tax rate is 15% because 1,500 divided by 10,000 is 0.15. On the other hand, Mr. Doyle earns $50,000 and takes home $45,000 after taxes, so he pays $5,000 in taxes. His tax rate would be 5,000 divided by 50,000, which is 0.10 or 10%.

Wait, so Mr. Gribbone, who earns less, is paying a higher percentage in taxes than Mr. Doyle, who earns more. That doesn't seem right if the tax system were progressive. I remember that in a progressive tax system, higher earners pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. But here, the opposite is happening: the lower earner pays a higher rate.

So let me think about the types again. 

Proportional tax means everyone pays the same percentage. So if both paid 10%, for example, that would be proportional. But here, the rates are differentâ€”15% vs. 10%. So it's not proportional.

Regressive tax is when higher earners pay a smaller percentage. That's exactly what's happening here. The person with the higher income ($50k) pays a lower tax rate (10%) compared to the lower-income person (15%). So this looks regressive.

Wait, but could I be mixing up the terms? Let me double-check. Progressive: higher income, higher rate. Regressive: higher income, lower rate. Yep, that's right.

So the question is asking what type of tax structure this is. The options are:

E: Progressive
F: Regressive
G: Proportional

The correct answer should be F: Regressive because the higher earner pays a lower tax rate. 

I should make sure I didn't get confused with the numbers. Mr. Gribbone: $10k income, $1.5k tax, 15%. Mr. Doyle: $50k income, $5k tax, 10%. Yep, higher income, lower rate. So definitely regressive.

The tax structure is regressive because the higher earner pays a lower tax rate than the lower earner.
