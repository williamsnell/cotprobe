Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the value of an inductor and a capacitor based on the energy stored. Hmm, I remember that both inductors and capacitors store energy, but the formulas are a bit different. Let me think about each part step by step.

Starting with part (a): the inductor. I recall that the energy stored in an inductor is given by the formula U = (1/2) * L * I², where L is the inductance and I is the current. Oh right, so they gave me the energy U as 20 J and the current I as 2 A. I need to solve for L.

So plugging the numbers into the formula: 20 J = 0.5 * L * (2)^2. Let me compute that. 2 squared is 4, so 0.5 * 4 is 2. So 20 equals 2 times L. To find L, I divide both sides by 2. 20 / 2 is 10. So L should be 10 H.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.5 * L * I². I squared is 4, 0.5 times 4 is 2. 2L =20, so L=10 H. Yeah, that seems right.

Now part (b): the capacitor. The energy stored in a capacitor is U = (1/2) * C * V². Here, U is 20 J and V is 500 volts. I need to find C.

So plugging in the values: 20 = 0.5 * C * (500)^2. 500 squared is 250,000. 0.5 times 250,000 is 125,000. So 20 = 125,000 * C. To solve for C, divide both sides by 125,000. 20 / 125,000 equals... let's see, 20 divided by 125 is 0.16, and then divided by 1000 is 0.00016. Wait, no, wait. 20 divided by 125,000 is 20/(125 *10^3) = (20/125) * 1e-3. 20/125 is 0.16, so 0.16 * 1e-3 is 0.00016 farads. Oh wait, but 1 microfarad is 1e-6 farads. So 0.00016 farads is 160 microfarads? Because 1e-6 is micro, so 0.00016 F is 160e-6 F, which is 160 µF.

Wait another way: 1e-6 is a micro, so 0.16e-3 F is 160e-6 F. Yeah, that makes it 160 µF.

So putting it together, I'm looking for an option where the inductor is 10 H and the capacitor is 160 µF. Let me look at the options.

Option C says 10 H, 160 µF. That matches. So the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the inductor and capacitor values using their respective energy storage formulas.

(a) For the inductor, the energy stored is given by:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} L I^2
\]

Substituting \( U = 20 \, \text{J} \) and \( I = 2 \, \text{A} \):

\[
20 = \frac{1}{2} L (2)^2 \implies 20 = 2L \implies L = 10 \, \text{H}
\]

(b) For the capacitor, the energy stored is given by:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2
\]

Substituting \( U = 20 \, \text{J} \) and \( V = 500 \, \text{V} \):

\[
20 = \frac{1}{2} C (500)^2 \implies 20 = 125,000 C \implies C = \frac{20}{125,000} = 0.00016 \, \text{F} = 160 \, \mu\text{F}
\]

Thus, the inductor is \( 10 \, \text{H} \) and the capacitor is \( 160 \, \mu\text{F} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C: 10 H, 160 µF**
