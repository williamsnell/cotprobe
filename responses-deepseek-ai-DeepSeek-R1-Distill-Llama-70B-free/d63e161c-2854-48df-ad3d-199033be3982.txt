Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the code-based phonic approach in early reading instruction. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says that first-grade students are taught the sounds of the letters b, a, s, and g. The approach here is code-based phonics, which I think focuses on teaching students to decode words by sounding out the individual letters. So the idea is that once they know the sounds of these letters, they can read simple words by combining them.

The task is to determine which of the given sentences would be the most effective first sentence for these students to read based on the letters they've learned. The options are A through J.

First, I should list out the letters they know: b, a, s, g. So any words in the sentence should be made up of these letters, or at least start with these letters, I suppose.

Looking at each option:

Option A: "Anna has a big dog." Let's see the words. "Anna" has a, but also n, which they haven't been taught yet. "Has" uses h, which they might not know. "Big" is good because it uses b, i, g. Wait, i isn't one of the letters they've learned yet, so maybe that's a problem. "Dog" uses d, o, g. D and o aren't in their set. So this sentence has several letters they haven't learned yet, which might make it difficult.

Option B: "A dog bit Ann." Again, "A" is fine, but "dog" has d and o they don't know. "Bit" has i and t, which are new. "Ann" has n, which they haven't learned. So this might be too challenging.

Option C: "Gail has a bag." "Gail" has g, a, i, l. They know g and a, but i and l are new. "Has" uses h, which is new. "Bag" is good: b, a, g. So the sentence has some known letters but also introduces new ones. It might be a bit tough as a first sentence.

Option D: "The cat sat on the mat." Hmm. "The" uses t, h, e. They don't know t or h yet. "Cat" has c, a, t. C is new. "Sat" has s, a, t. They know s and a, but t is new. "On" uses o and n, which are new. "Mat" is m, a, t. M and t are new. So this sentence introduces a lot of new letters, which might not be ideal for their first reading.

Option E: "Big bags are heavy." "Big" uses b, i, g. They know b and g, but i is new. "Bags" is b, a, g, s. They know all except maybe the ending 's' sound, but s is one of the letters they've learned. Wait, no, s is in the set. So "bags" is made of b, a, g, s. So that's good. "Are" uses a, r, e. R and e are new. "Heavy" has h, e, v, y. All new letters. So maybe this isn't the best first sentence.

Option F: "Sam has a bag." "Sam" uses s, a, m. They know s and a, but m is new. "Has" again has h, which is new. "Bag" is good as before. So this sentence introduces m and h, which they haven't learned yet. So maybe not the best.

Option G: "Gail has a bass." "Gail" has g, a, i, l. They know g and a; i and l are new. "Has" uses h. "Bass" is b, a, s, s. They know b, a, s. So "bass" is okay. But the other words have new letters, so maybe this isn't the best option.

Option H: "Bob sang a song." "Bob" uses b, o, b. O is new. "Sang" has s, a, n, g. They know s, a, g, but n is new. "Song" uses o, n, g. Both new letters. So this introduces o and n, which they haven't learned yet.

Option I: "Bob ate a snack." "Bob" again has o. "Ate" uses a, t, e. T and e are new. "Snack" has s, n, a, c, k. They know s and a, but the others are new. So this might be too challenging.

Option J: "Sally was happy." "Sally" has s, a, l, l, y. They know s and a, but l and y are new. "Was" uses w, a, s. W is new. "Happy" has h, a, p, p, y. H and p are new. So this introduces several new letters.

Now, considering all the options, I'm looking for a sentence where all the words can be decoded using just the letters b, a, s, g. Let's check each word in each option.

Wait, maybe I should look for a sentence where each word only uses the letters b, a, s, g. But that might be too strict because sentences can have common sight words that might be taught early on, like "a" or "the", but in this case, the letters they've learned are only b, a, s, g.

Wait, the question says they are taught the sounds of these letters, so maybe each word in the sentence should start with one of these letters or contain them, but perhaps not necessarily all. Hmm, but the idea is that the students should be able to sound out the words using the letters they've learned.

Looking again, maybe the best approach is to find the sentence where all the words can be constructed from the letters they know. Let's check each option.

Option C: "Gail has a bag." Gail has letters g, a, i, l. They know g and a, but i and l are new. "Has" has h, which is new. "Bag" is good. So maybe this isn't the best.

Option F: "Sam has a bag." Sam: s, a, m (m is new). "Has" has h, new. "Bag" is good.

Option E: "Big bags are heavy." "Big" has i (new). "Bags" is okay. "Are" has r and e (new). "Heavy" has h, e, v, y (all new). So not great.

Option G: "Gail has a bass." Gail has i and l. "Bass" is good. So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the sentence should only contain words that are made up of the letters b, a, s, g, and perhaps common function words like "a" or "is" if those letters are used.

Wait, looking again, maybe the best sentence is one where all the content words are built from b, a, s, g, and the function words (like "a", "has", etc.) might be introduced as sight words or phonetically regular.

Wait, let's think about the words. The letters they've learned are b, a, s, g.

Which words can be made from these letters?

- "a" is one letter, known.
- "as" would be a word, but it's a conjunction.
- "bag" is b, a, g.
- "sag" is s, a, g.
- "gas" is g, a, s.
- "bas" isn't a common word.
- "big" uses i, which they don't know.

Looking at the options, let's see if any sentences are made up of these possible words.

Option C: "Gail has a bag." The word "bag" is good, but "Gail" and "has" have letters they don't know.

Option E: "Big bags are heavy." "Bags" is good, but "big" has an i.

Option F: "Sam has a bag." "Bag" is good, but "Sam" has m.

Option H: "Bob sang a song." "Bob" has o, which is new.

Wait, perhaps the best choice is a sentence where as many words as possible can be decoded with the letters they know.

Looking again, maybe option C or E.

Wait, let's consider the first word. The first word should start with a letter they know, perhaps. Let's see the options:

Option C: "Gail" starts with G, which they know.

Option E: "Big" starts with B.

Option F: "Sam" starts with S.

Option G: "Gail" starts with G.

Option H: "Bob" starts with B.

Option I: "Bob" starts with B.

Option J: "Sally" starts with S.

So maybe sentences starting with B, S, or G would be better, as those letters are known.

Now, looking for a sentence where all the words either start with B, A, S, G or are made up of these letters.

Wait, perhaps the sentence should be composed of words that only use the letters b, a, s, g. Let's check each option's words.

Option C: Gail (g, a, i, l) → has i and l, which are unknown. So probably not.

Option E: Big (b, i, g) → i is unknown. So not ideal.

Option F: Sam (s, a, m) → m is unknown.

Option G: Gail (g, a, i, l) → again, i and l are unknown.

Option H: Bob (b, o, b) → o is unknown.

Option I: Bob (same as H), "ate" (a, t, e) → t and e unknown.

Option J: Sally (s, a, l, l, y) → l and y unknown.

Wait, maybe none of the options perfectly fit, but I have to choose the best one.

Alternatively, perhaps the sentence should use as few new letters as possible beyond b, a, s, g.

Looking again, perhaps option C: "Gail has a bag." The words are Gail, has, a, bag. They know a, bag. Gail has g and a, but also i and l. "Has" has h. So maybe that's introducing more letters than desired.

Option F: "Sam has a bag." Sam uses s, a, m (m is new). Bag is good. "Has" has h. So m and h are new.

Option E: "Big bags are heavy." "Big" uses i (new), "bags" is good. "Are" uses r and e (new). "Heavy" uses h, e, v, y. So that's a lot of new letters.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: "Gail has a bag." Because "Gail" starts with G, which they know. "Has" may be a sight word they can learn, and "bag" is made of letters they know. Alternatively, maybe "Gail has a bag" is a better option because it's a name and the rest are simple.

Alternatively, perhaps the best option is E: "Big bags are heavy." Because "big" and "bags" are both made up of b, a, g, s. Wait, big has an i, which they don't know. So that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The letters taught are b, a, s, g. So the words that can be made are:

- a
- as
- bag
- sag
- gas
- sab (not a common word)
- etc.

Looking at the options, perhaps the sentence should have words that only use these letters.

Looking through the options, let's check each word in each sentence.

Option C: "Gail has a bag."

Gail: letters g, a, i, l → i and l are new.
has: h, a, s → h is new.
a: known.
bag: known.

So "Gail" and "has" introduce new letters.

Option F: "Sam has a bag."

Sam: s, a, m → m new.
has: h new.
bag: known.

Option E: "Big bags are heavy."

Big: b, i, g → i new.
bags: b, a, g, s → known.
are: a, r, e → r and e new.
heavy: h, e, v, y → all new.

Hmm.

Option G: "Gail has a bass."

Gail: same as before.
has: same.
a: known.
bass: b, a, s, s → known.

So "bass" is good. "Gail has a bass." The word "bass" is made from b, a, s, s, which they all know. So bass is okay. But "Gail" has i and l, which they don't know. "Has" has h, which they don't know.

Option H: "Bob sang a song."

Bob: b, o, b → o new.
sang: s, a, n, g → n new.
a: known.
song: s, o, n, g → o and n new.

Option I: "Bob ate a snack."

Bob: same as H.
ate: a, t, e → t and e new.
a: known.
snack: s, n, a, c, k → n, c, k new.

Option J: "Sally was happy."

Sally: s, a, l, l, y → l and y new.
was: w, a, s → w new.
happy: h, a, p, p, y → h, p, y new.

So among all options, perhaps the best is option C: "Gail has a bag." Because "bag" is made from known letters. "Gail" and "has" introduce a couple of new letters, but maybe as a first sentence, it's manageable. Alternatively, perhaps option E, but "big" has an i which is unknown.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the sentence should have the fewest number of new letters. Let's count the number of new letters in each option.

Option C: Gail (i, l), has (h), a, bag (none). So new letters: i, l, h.

Option E: big (i), bags (none), are (r, e), heavy (h, v, y). So new letters: i, r, e, h, v, y. That's more.

Option F: Sam (m), has (h), a, bag. New letters: m, h.

Option G: Gail (i, l), has (h), a, bass (none). New letters: i, l, h.

Option H: Bob (o), sang (n), a, song (o, n). New letters: o, n.

Option I: Bob (o), ate (t, e), a, snack (n, c, k). New letters: o, t, e, n, c, k.

Option J: Sally (l, y), was (w), happy (h, p, y). New letters: l, y, w, h, p.

So which option has the fewest new letters? Let's see:

Option C: 3 new letters.
Option F: 2 new letters (m, h).
Option H: 2 new letters (o, n).
Option G: 3 new letters.

So option F has only m and h as new letters. But does that make it a better choice?

Option F: "Sam has a bag." So the words are Sam (s, a, m), has (h, a, s), a, bag (b, a, g).

The new letters here are m and h. So the students would have to learn these two new letters in addition to the ones they already know. But the sentence is otherwise simple.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to choose a sentence where the majority of the letters are known, and only a few are new. Since option F introduces m and h, but the other letters are known, maybe that's better.

Wait, but the question is about the first sentence they read. So maybe the sentence should have as few new letters as possible, ideally none. But none of the options seem to fit that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the correct answer is option C: "Gail has a bag." Because "Gail" starts with G, and "bag" is known. Alternatively, maybe option E isn't right because of the i.

Wait, another thought: in a code-based approach, the students are taught to sound out words. So the first sentence should be made up of words that can be sounded out with the letters they know. So let's check each word in each option.

Option C: "Gail has a bag."

- Gail: G, A, I, L. They know G and A, so they can sound out G-A, but then I and L are new. So maybe they can't read Gail without knowing I and L.

- has: H, A, S. They know A and S, but not H. So they can't sound out has.

- a: known.

- bag: known.

So this sentence has two words they can't fully sound out (Gail and has), because they don't know H, I, L.

Option F: "Sam has a bag."

- Sam: S, A, M. They know S and A, but not M. So can't sound out Sam.

- has: H, A, S. Again, H is unknown.

- a: known.

- bag: known.

So two words they can't fully sound out.

Option E: "Big bags are heavy."

- Big: B, I, G. They know B and G, but not I. So can't sound out Big.

- bags: B, A, G, S. All known letters. So they can sound this out.

- are: A, R, E. They know A, but not R and E.

- heavy: H, E, V, Y. All unknown.

So only "bags" is fully known.

Option G: "Gail has a bass."

- Gail: same as before, I and L unknown.

- has: same, H unknown.

- a: known.

- bass: B, A, S, S. All known. So they can read bass.

But Gail and has are problematic.

Option H: "Bob sang a song."

- Bob: B, O, B. O unknown.

- sang: S, A, N, G. N unknown.

- a: known.

- song: S, O, N, G. O and N unknown.

So can't read Bob, sang, song.

Option I: "Bob
