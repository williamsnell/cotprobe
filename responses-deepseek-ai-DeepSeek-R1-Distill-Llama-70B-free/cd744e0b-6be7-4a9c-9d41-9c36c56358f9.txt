Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Ross's view on prima facie duties. Hmm, I remember that Ross was a philosopher who talked about ethics, specifically about duties. Prima facie duties are like the obligations we have on the surface, before considering all the details of a situation. 

The question is asking how we learn about these prima facie duties according to Ross. The options are A to J, each suggesting a different method. Let me think about Ross's theory. I recall that he was part of the intuitionist school, which means he believed that we can know certain moral truths through intuition rather than through reasoning alone.

Wait, but more specifically, I think Ross believed that we come to know these duties by considering particular cases and then generalizing. Like, we see that certain actions, like keeping promises, are generally right, and from those specific instances, we form general principles. So it's a sort of bottom-up approach. 

Looking at the options, option E says: "by seeing the prima facie rightness of particular acts, and then apprehending general principles." That sounds right because it's about starting with specific acts and moving to general rules. 

Option B says the opposite: starting with general principles and then applying them to particular acts. That seems more like a top-down approach, which I don't think Ross supported. He was more about starting with the particular. 

So the correct answer should be E. Let me just go through the other options to make sure. Option C mentions intuition, which is related, but I think it's more about the method of learning the duties through particular acts first. So E is more precise.

The correct answer is E: by seeing the prima facie rightness of particular acts, and then apprehending general principles.
