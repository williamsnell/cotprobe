Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about turbines, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about calculating the internal efficiency and the reheat factor for a three-stage turbine. The turbine operates between an initial pressure of 100 psia, which is saturated steam, and a final pressure of 1 psia. They mentioned that the approach velocity is negligible, the stage efficiency is 65 percent, and the process is isentropic. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out the internal efficiency and the reheat factor.

Wait, I remember that turbines can have different efficiencies and factors based on how they operate. The internal efficiency, I think, is the actual work output divided by the ideal work output, considering irreversibilities. And the reheat factor is related to the deviation from isentropic flow, especially in multi-stage turbines where the steam might not follow the ideal isentropic path due to reheating.

But wait, the problem states that the process is isentropic. Oh, but that's probably the overall process. Each stage might not be isentropic because the stage efficiency is given as 65%. So each stage operates with 65% efficiency, but the overall process is isentropic. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, internal efficiency for a turbine is the ratio of actual work to the isentropic work, right? So if each stage has an efficiency of 65%, but there are three stages, how does that play into the overall internal efficiency?

Alternatively, maybe internal efficiency is the same as the stage efficiency in this context. But I'm not sure. I think internal efficiency might be the overall turbine's efficiency, while each stage has its own stage efficiency.

Wait, the problem says the stage efficiency is 65%, so each stage has 65% efficiency. So the internal efficiency for the entire turbine would be based on that, perhaps considering each stage's contribution.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the isentropic process. If the overall process is isentropic, then the entropy doesn't change, but each stage might have some inefficiency. So perhaps each stage is operating with its own efficiency, but the overall turbine's internal efficiency is higher than the stage efficiency because the later stages have different conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the internal efficiency is the product of each stage's efficiency. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. For a multi-stage turbine, each stage has its own efficiency, but the overall turbine's internal efficiency would be the product of each stage's efficiency only if the work extraction is the same in each stage, which I don't think is the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the internal efficiency is the same as the stage efficiency because each stage contributes similarly. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the internal efficiency (η_int) is the actual work (W_act) divided by the ideal work (W_ideal), so η_int = W_act / W_ideal.

But each stage operates with a stage efficiency, so maybe the actual work per stage is η_stage * W_ideal per stage. So over three stages, the total actual work would be sum(η_stage * W_ideal_stage). But if the process is isentropic overall, then the ideal work for each stage is such that the sum gives the overall isentropic work.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model this. Let me think of the turbine as having three stages, each with 65% efficiency. The initial state is saturated steam at 100 psia, and the final is 1 psia.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the isentropic work first. Because internal efficiency is about the actual work versus the ideal work. So for the entire turbine, the ideal (isentropic) work would be the enthalpy drop from inlet to outlet. Let me recall the formula.

The work done in an isentropic turbine is given by W = h1 - h2s, where h1 is the inlet enthalpy, and h2s is the outlet enthalpy after isentropic expansion.

But since the turbine is multi-stage, each stage would have its own isentropic process. Wait, but in reality, each stage might have some pressure drop, so the overall process is broken into stages.

Wait, but the problem states that the overall process is isentropic, which might imply that each stage's process is also isentropic. But that can't be right because the stage efficiency is 65%, which is less than 100%, so each stage can't be isentropic.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up concepts. The overall process from inlet to outlet is isentropic, but each stage's expansion isn't, due to inefficiencies. Or maybe the process is isentropic in the sense that the actual process follows an isentropic path, but that doesn't make sense because then the efficiency would be 100%.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think differently.

The internal efficiency is the ratio of actual work to the isentropic work. So internal efficiency η = W_act / W_isen.

But each stage has its own stage efficiency, which I think is the same as the internal efficiency for that stage. So for each stage, the actual work is η_stage * (h_in - h_outs), where h_in and h_outs are the isentropic enthalpies for that stage.

Wait, but in a multi-stage turbine, the stages are arranged so that each stage operates at a certain pressure ratio. So perhaps each stage's isentropic work is (h_in - h_outs), and the actual work is η_stage * (h_in - h_outs) for each stage.

So the total actual work would be the sum of each stage's actual work, which is the sum of η_stage*(h_in - h_outs) for each stage.

The total isentropic work for the entire turbine would be h1 - h2s, where h1 is the inlet enthalpy and h2s is the final isentropic enthalpy.

Wait, but if each stage is operating isentropically except for the inefficiency, then the internal efficiency for the whole turbine would be (sum of η_stage*(h_in - h_outs)) ) / (h1 - h2s).

But since each stage's efficiency is 65%, and there are three stages, perhaps each stage's isentropic work is the same? Or does each stage have a different work output?

Alternatively, maybe each stage has the same pressure ratio, but I don't know if that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each stage operates under the same efficiency and that the overall turbine's internal efficiency is calculated considering each stage's contribution. So maybe the total work is 3 times the work per stage, with each stage having 65% efficiency.

Wait, no, because the work per stage depends on the pressure drop in that stage. So if the pressure drops are the same in each stage, then each stage's isentropic work would be the same, and the actual work would be 0.65 times that for each stage.

Wait, but the overall isentropic work would be the sum of each stage's isentropic work. So for three stages with the same pressure ratio, each would have (h1 - h2) for the first stage, then (h2 - h3) for the second, and (h3 - h4) for the third, where h4 is the final enthalpy.

Wait, but the initial pressure is 100 psia (saturated steam), so h1 is the enthalpy of saturated vapor at 100 psia. The final pressure is 1 psia, so h4s would be the enthalpy at 1 psia after isentropic expansion.

But each stage's expansion is isentropic, but with some efficiency. So maybe each stage's actual work is 0.65 times the ideal work for that stage.

So the total actual work would be 0.65*(h1 - h2s) + 0.65*(h2 - h3s) + 0.65*(h3 - h4s), where h2s, h3s are the isentropic enthalpies after each stage.

Wait, but in that case, the total actual work would be 0.65*(h1 - h4s) because the sum of the isentropic works for each stage is h1 - h4s.

So the internal efficiency for the entire turbine would be (0.65*(h1 - h4s)) / (h1 - h4s) ) = 0.65. So the internal efficiency is 65%?

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is efficiency 0.65 and reheat factor 1.675, which seems possible. But wait, I also need to calculate the reheat factor, which I haven't considered yet.

What's the reheat factor? I recall that the reheat factor (RF) is defined as the ratio of the actual enthalpy drop to the isentropic enthalpy drop in each stage. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the sum of actual enthalpy drops to the isentropic total.

Wait, no, the reheat factor is used when the expansion isn't isentropic, and it accounts for the fact that in a multi-stage turbine, the steam may not follow the same path as an isentropic expansion. The reheat factor is calculated as the sum of the actual enthalpy drops in each stage divided by the total isentropic enthalpy drop.

Wait, more accurately, the reheat factor is the ratio of the sum of the actual enthalpy changes for each stage to the total isentropic enthalpy change from inlet to outlet.

So RF = (Δh1_act + Δh2_act + Δh3_act) / (h1 - h2s_total)

But each stage's actual enthalpy change is Δh_act = η_stage * Δh_isen_stage.

So for each stage, Δh_act = 0.65 * (h_in - h_outs).

But the sum of all Δh_act would be 0.65*(h1 - h2s + h2 - h3s + h3 - h4s), which simplifies to 0.65*(h1 - h4s).

Wait, but the total isentropic enthalpy drop is h1 - h4s. So RF would be (0.65*(h1 - h4s)) / (h1 - h4s)) = 0.65. But that can't be right because the reheat factor is usually greater than 1 for multi-stage turbines.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the reheat factor. Let me think again. The reheat factor is defined as the actual total enthalpy change divided by the isentropic enthalpy change. So RF = (h1 - h2a + h2a - h3a + h3a - h4a) / (h1 - h4s). Wait, that's just (h1 - h4a)/(h1 - h4s), which is the internal efficiency. But that's not matching my previous understanding.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing reheat factor with something else. Oh wait, I think the reheat factor applies when the turbine has reheat between stages, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, I might be mixing up concepts with the regenerative cycle.

Alternatively, perhaps the reheat factor is the ratio of the sum of the stage isentropic enthalpy drops to the overall isentropic enthalpy drop. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, I found a formula in my notes: Reheat Factor (RF) = (ΣΔh_stage_isen) / (Δh_total_isen).

Wait, no, that would be if each stage's isentropic drop is summed, but if each stage's pressure ratio is the same, then each Δh_stage_isen would be (h1 - h2s), (h2 - h3s), (h3 - h4s), but that's equal to the total Δh_total_isen. So their sum would be equal, so RF would be 1, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe the reheat factor is the ratio of the sum of the actual enthalpy drops to the total isentropic enthalpy drop.

Wait, but that would be RF = (ΣΔh_act) / (h1 - h4s). And since Δh_act per stage is η_stage * Δh_isen_stage, then ΣΔh_act = η_stage * ΣΔh_isen_stage = η_stage*(h1 - h4s). So RF = η_stage*(h1 - h4s) / (h1 - h4s) ) = η_stage, which is 0.65. But that contradicts my earlier thought that RF is usually greater than 1.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think about the Mollier chart. In a multi-stage turbine, each stage's expansion isn't truly isentropic, but the overall process from inlet to outlet is isentropic. So each stage's actual process would have a higher entropy, but overall, the entropy increases are such that the total entropy matches the isentropic process.

Wait, no, the overall process here is isentropic, so the total entropy doesn't increase. But each stage's process has an entropy increase, but perhaps the sum of those increases results in zero net change. That doesn't make much sense because entropy is a state function, so the overall change would be zero.

Alternatively, maybe each stage's process is such that the total entropy remains constant. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to find the internal efficiency and reheat factor.

Internal efficiency is actual work divided by isentropic work. So for the entire turbine, W_act = sum of each stage's actual work. Each stage's actual work is η_stage * W_isen_stage. So W_act = η_stage*(W1_isen + W2_isen + W3_isen). But W1_isen + W2_isen + W3_isen is the total isentropic work, which is h1 - h4s. So W_act = η_stage*(h1 - h4s). Therefore, internal efficiency η_int = W_act / (h1 - h4s) = 0.65.

So the internal efficiency is 0.65, which is 65%. Looking at the options, option C has efficiency 0.65 and reheat factor 1.675.

Now, what about the reheat factor? Let me recall that the reheat factor is defined as the ratio of the sum of the actual enthalpy drops per stage to the total isentropic enthalpy drop. Wait, but if each stage's actual enthalpy drop is η_stage times the isentropic drop for that stage, then sum of actual drops would be 0.65*(h1 - h2s + h2 - h3s + h3 - h4s) = 0.65*(h1 - h4s). So sum actual drops is 0.65*(h1 - h4s), and the total isentropic drop is (h1 - h4s). So RF would be sum actual / sum isen = 0.65, which is the same as the internal efficiency. But that's not matching any options except option C, which has a reheat factor of 1.675, which is higher than 1.

Hmm, maybe I have the definition wrong. Another possibility: reheat factor is the ratio of the actual total work to the isentropic work. But that's the internal efficiency, which we've determined as 0.65.

Wait, perhaps the reheat factor is the inverse of the internal efficiency. No, that doesn't make sense with the options given.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the actual process in each stage. Each stage has an isentropic process, but with inefficiency, so the actual enthalpy at each stage's exit is higher than the isentropic value. This leads to a higher enthalpy entering the next stage, thus a higher enthalpy drop in the subsequent stages. So the total actual enthalpy drop would be higher than the isentropic, leading to a reheat factor greater than 1.

Wait, that makes sense. Because each stage's inefficiency causes the steam to have a higher enthalpy than it would in an isentropic process, so each subsequent stage has to handle steam with higher enthalpy, leading to more work extracted than the isentropic case. So the sum of the actual enthalpy drops would be greater than the isentropic total, making RF greater than 1.

So, reheat factor RF = (sum of actual Δh per stage) / (total isentropic Δh).

But each stage's actual Δh is higher than the isentropic Δh for that stage because of the inefficiency. Wait, no, because the actual work is less than the isentropic work. So actual Δh = η_stage * isentropic Δh.

Wait, no, the actual work is less, so the actual enthalpy drop is less than the isentropic. Because W = η * W_isen.

But if that's the case, each stage's actual Δh is less than the isentropic Δh, so the sum of actual Δh would be less than the sum of isentropic Δh, making RF less than 1. But that contradicts what I thought earlier.

Wait, I'm getting really confused here. Let me try to think of it numerically.

Suppose the turbine has three stages. Let's say each stage has an isentropic enthalpy drop of Δh_isen. So total isentropic Δh is 3*Δh_isen.

But each stage's actual Δh is η_stage * Δh_isen, so each is 0.65 * Δh_isen.

So sum of actual Δh is 3 * 0.65 * Δh_isen = 1.95 * Δh_isen.

Total isentropic Δh is 3 * Δh_isen.

So RF = sum actual / sum isen = (1.95 Δh_isen) / (3 Δh_isen) ) = 0.65.

But that's the same as the internal efficiency, and it's less than 1. But I thought RF is usually greater than 1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reheat factor is the ratio of the sum of the isentropic enthalpy drops for each stage to the total isentropic enthalpy drop. But that would be 3Δh_isen / 3Δh_isen = 1, which doesn't help.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing reheat factor with something else. Perhaps the reheat factor is the ratio of the actual total enthalpy drop to the isentropic total. So if actual total is less than isentropic, then RF would be less than 1, but in reality, when you have inefficiencies, the actual work is
