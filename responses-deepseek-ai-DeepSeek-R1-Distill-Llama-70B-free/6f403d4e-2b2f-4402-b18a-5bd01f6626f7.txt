H: True, True
I: Both statements are true, but they are not related.
J: Statement 1 is true because all positive integers have a cyclic group. Statement 2 is false because not all finite cyclic groups contain an element of every order that divides the order of the group.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about cyclic groups in group theory. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate whether each is true or false.

Statement 1: For every positive integer n, there is a cyclic group of order n.
Hmm, I remember that cyclic groups are groups that can be generated by a single element. So, like, if you have an element g in the group, every element can be written as some power of g. I think the integers under addition are an infinite cyclic group. And for finite ones, like Z_n, the additive group of integers modulo n, those are cyclic too. So for any positive integer n, Z_n is a cyclic group of order n. So Statement 1 should be true. That makes sense because whether n is prime, composite, or 1, Z_n exists and is cyclic.

Wait, could there be any positive integer where this isn't possible? Well, n=1 would have the trivial group, which is cyclic. And for primes, those are cyclic as well. So I don't see any n where a cyclic group doesn't exist. So Statement 1 is true.

Statement 2: Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.
Okay, this is a bit trickier. I think it relates to Lagrange's theorem, which says that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. But this is about elements, not subgroups. Oh wait, in a cyclic group, for each divisor d of the group's order, there exists a unique subgroup of order d, and each such subgroup is cyclic. Moreover, each element of the group has an order that divides the group's order. But does every divisor correspond to an element of that order?

Wait, in a cyclic group G of order n, for each d dividing n, there exists an element of order d. Because the group is cyclic, so it's isomorphic to Z_n. In Z_n, the element n/d generates a subgroup of order d. Wait, no, actually, the element d in Z_n has order n/gcd(n,d). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. In Z_n, the elements are {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}, and the operation is addition mod n. The order of an element k is the smallest positive integer m such that m*k ≡ 0 mod n. So m = n / gcd(n, k). So for each divisor d of n, can I find a k such that gcd(n, k) = n/d? Yes, because if d divides n, then n/d is an integer, and if I set k = n/d, then gcd(n, n/d) = n/d, so the order of k would be d. So yes, for every d dividing n, there's an element of order d.

Wait, but wait. Let me take an example. Suppose n=6. The divisors are 1,2,3,6. The group Z_6 has elements 0,1,2,3,4,5. The order of 0 is 1. The order of 1 is 6, since 6*1=6≡0 mod6. The order of 2 is 3 because 2*3=6≡0 mod6. The order of 3 is 2, since 3*2=6≡0. The order of 4 is 3, because 4*3=12≡0 mod6. And 5 has order 6. So the orders present are 1,2,3,6. So each divisor of 6 is covered. So yes, every d dividing 6 has an element of order d.

So Statement 2 is true. Wait but wait, what if the group is not cyclic? Well, the statement only applies to finite cyclic groups. So in a cyclic group, yes, every divisor of the order has an element of that order. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but I thought maybe there was a mistake. Let me think about another example. Suppose n=4. The cyclic group Z_4 has elements 0,1,2,3. The orders are: 0→1, 1→4, 2→2, 3→4. So the orders are 1,2,4. Which are all the divisors of 4. So yes, each divisor has an element of that order.

So both statements are true. So looking back at the options, which option says both are true?

Looking at the options:

Option H: True, True. So that's the one.

Wait, but let me double-check the options because sometimes they include other possibilities.

The options are:

A: S1 false, S2 true.

B: S1 false (only composite), S2 true.

C: False, False.

D: True, False.

E: False, True.

F: S1 false (only prime), S2 true.

G: S1 true, S2 false (only infinite).

H: True, True.

I: Both true, but not related.

J: S1 true, S2 false.

So the correct answer should be H. Because both statements are true.

Wait, but wait another thing about Statement 2. It says "every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group." So perhaps the confusion is about the difference between elements and subgroups. But no, because in a cyclic group, for each divisor d of n, there's a unique cyclic subgroup of order d, and each such subgroup has elements of order d. So yes, the group contains elements of every such order. So Statement 2 is correct.

Therefore, both statements are true. So the correct answer is H.
</think>

Statement 1: For every positive integer \( n \), there is a cyclic group of order \( n \).  
This is true because for any positive integer \( n \), the additive group \( \mathbb{Z}_n \) (the integers modulo \( n \)) is a cyclic group of order \( n \). This holds regardless of whether \( n \) is prime, composite, or 1. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.

Statement 2: Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.  
This is also true. In a finite cyclic group \( G \) of order \( n \), for every divisor \( d \) of \( n \), there exists an element of order \( d \). This follows from the structure of cyclic groups, where the group is isomorphic to \( \mathbb{Z}_n \), and for each divisor \( d \) of \( n \), there is an element \( k \) such that \( \gcd(n, k) = \frac{n}{d} \), giving \( k \) an order of \( d \). Thus, Statement 2 is true.

Since both statements are true, the correct answer is:

**H: True, True.**
