Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's take it step by step. 

The problem says that 2.5 mmol of nitrogen gas (N₂) occupies 42 cm³ at 300 K, and then it expands isothermally to 600 cm³. I need to calculate the change in Gibbs free energy, ΔG, for this process. The options are from A to J, with various negative values and one zero.

Hmm, I remember that Gibbs free energy change for an isothermal process can be calculated using the formula ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1), but wait, wait. Or is it using pressure? Oh right, because for an ideal gas, the change in Gibbs free energy at constant temperature is given by ΔG = nRT ln(P1/P2), since P and V are inversely related. Alternatively, since PV = nRT, maybe I can express it in terms of volume as well.

Wait, another thought: for an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal expansion, the change in Gibbs free energy is ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1). Or is it the other way around? Because when a gas expands, it's doing work, so the change in G would depend on the direction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Gibbs free energy change at constant temperature is given by ΔG = VΔP, but that's when pressure changes. Alternatively, if the process is reversible and isothermal, ΔG would be nRT ln(P1/P2). Since the gas is expanding, the pressure is decreasing, so P1 is higher than P2. So ln(P1/P2) would be positive, making ΔG positive? But wait, the options are negative, except for I which is zero. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should express it in terms of volume since we have the volumes given. So using the formula ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1) when pressure is constant, but wait, no. Wait, I think the correct formula is ΔG = nRT ln(P1/P2) because Gibbs free energy depends on pressure. But since the process is expansion at constant temperature, and assuming it's reversible.

Wait, another approach: I can use the ideal gas law to find the initial and final pressures, then compute ΔG using nRT ln(P1/P2).

So initial state: n = 2.5 mmol, which is 2.5e-3 mol. T is 300 K. Volume V1 is 42 cm³, which is 42e-6 m³. Wait, or should I convert cm³ to liters? Because R is usually in terms of L·atm/(mol·K), but I'm not sure about the units here.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). So in terms of SI units, pressure would be in Pascals, volume in m³. Let me convert the volumes.

V1 = 42 cm³ = 42e-6 m³. V2 = 600 cm³ = 600e-6 m³.

Wait, but for an ideal gas, PV = nRT. So initial pressure P1 = nRT / V1, and final pressure P2 = nRT / V2.

But wait, the process is isothermal expansion, so the pressure decreases. So P1 is higher than P2.

So the ratio P1/P2 would be V2/V1. Because P1 = (nRT)/V1, P2 = (nRT)/V2. So P1/P2 = V2/V1.

So ln(P1/P2) = ln(V2/V1). Therefore, ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1).

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about the formula. I think for Gibbs free energy, when the process is isothermal and reversible, the change is ΔG = nRT ln(P1/P2). Alternatively, since PV = nRT, P1 V1 = P2 V2 when T is constant. So P1/P2 = V2/V1. So substituting, ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1).

Wait, but that would make sense when the volume is increasing. So in this case, the volume increases from 42 to 600 cm³, so V2 > V1. So ln(V2/V1) is positive, making ΔG positive. But all the answer options except I are negative. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think again. Gibbs free energy for expansion: for an ideal gas, the Gibbs free energy change at constant temperature is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). Because when the pressure decreases (expansion), P2 < P1, so ln(P2/P1) is negative. So ΔG would be negative, which aligns with the answer options.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The formula for Gibbs free energy change when pressure changes is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1) when T is constant. So if the gas expands, P2 < P1, so P2/P1 < 1, ln of that is negative. So ΔG would be negative, which matches the options.

Alternatively, another formula: ΔG = VΔP when T is constant. But I think using the nRT ln approach is better here.

So let me recast the problem using this.

Given: n = 2.5 mmol = 2.5e-3 mol.

T = 300 K.

V1 = 42 cm³ = 0.042 L? Wait, no. Wait, 1 L is 1000 cm³, so 42 cm³ is 0.042 L. Similarly, 600 cm³ is 0.6 L.

Wait, but in terms of SI units, 1 m³ is 1e6 L? No, wait 1 m³ = 1000 L. So 42 cm³ is 42e-6 m³, and 600 cm³ is 600e-6 m³.

Hmm, but maybe it's easier to use R in L·atm units. Because R can be 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Let me try that.

So, first, find the initial pressure P1 and final pressure P2.

Using PV = nRT,

P1 = (nRT)/V1 = (2.5e-3 mol) * (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * (300 K) ) / (0.042 L)

Similarly, P2 = (same numerator) / 0.6 L.

Wait, let's compute P1 first.

nRT = 2.5e-3 * 0.0821 * 300

Compute that: 2.5e-3 * 0.0821 = 0.00020525, multiplied by 300 is 0.061575. So that's 0.061575 L·atm.

So P1 = 0.061575 / 0.042 ≈ 1.465 atm.

Similarly, P2 = 0.061575 / 0.6 ≈ 0.102625 atm.

So P2 is about 0.1026 atm, P1 is about 1.465 atm.

So the ratio P1/P2 is 1.465 / 0.102625 ≈ 14.2857.

So ln(P1/P2) = ln(14.2857) ≈ 2.663.

Wait, but wait. The formula for ΔG is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1), because when the pressure decreases, P2 < P1, so P2/P1 is less than 1, making ln negative, so ΔG negative.

Alternatively, using the formula ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). Let me confirm that.

Yes, because at constant T, ΔG = VΔP, but for an ideal gas, it's better to express it using pressures. So for expansion, the system is doing work, and the Gibbs free energy would decrease, so ΔG should be negative.

So using n = 2.5e-3 mol, R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T = 300 K.

So ΔG = (2.5e-3 mol) * (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)) * (300 K) * ln(P2/P1).

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because if I use P1 and P2 as I calculated, then ln(P2/P1) is negative.

So let's compute ln(P2/P1) = ln(0.102625 / 1.465) = ln(0.06997) ≈ ln(0.07) ≈ -2.659.

So ΔG = (2.5e-3) * 0.0821 * 300 * (-2.659).

Compute the numbers step by step.

First, compute 2.5e-3 * 0.0821 = 0.00020525.

Multiply by 300: 0.00020525 * 300 = 0.061575.

Multiply by (-2.659): 0.061575 * (-2.659) ≈ -0.1638 L·atm.

Now, convert L·atm to Joules. 1 L·atm is approximately 101.325 J.

So ΔG ≈ -0.1638 * 101.325 ≈ -16.6 J.

Hmm, looking at the options, option J is -17 J. That's pretty close. But wait, let's check my calculations again for any possible errors.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me go through them again.

n = 2.5 mmol = 0.0025 mol.

R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) [Using SI units this time, maybe that's easier].

T = 300 K.

Compute P1 and P2 using PV = nRT.

V1 = 42 cm³ = 42e-6 m³.

V2 = 600 cm³ = 600e-6 m³.

Compute P1 = nRT / V1 = (0.0025 mol)(8.314 J/mol·K)(300 K) / (42e-6 m³).

Calculate numerator: 0.0025 * 8.314 * 300 = 0.0025 * 2494.2 ≈ 6.2355 J.

So P1 = 6.2355 / 42e-6 m³. Since 1 Pa = 1 J/m³, so P1 = 6.2355 / 42e-6 Pa = approx 148500 Pa? Wait, 42e-6 is 4.2e-5 m³. So 6.2355 / 4.2e-5 = approximately 148,500 Pa. Which is about 148.5 kPa, or about 1.47 atm (since 1 atm is ~101.325 kPa). So that matches my earlier calculation.

P2 = nRT / V2 = 6.2355 J / 600e-6 m³ = 6.2355 / 6e-4 = approx 10,392.5 Pa, which is about 0.1025 atm.

So P1 = ~1.465 atm, P2 ~0.1025 atm.

Now, ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1) = (0.0025 mol)(8.314 J/mol·K)(300 K) ln(0.1025/1.465).

Compute the product: 0.0025 * 8.314 * 300 = same as before, ~6.2355 J.

Now, ln(0.1025/1.465) = ln(0.06997) ≈ -2.659.

So ΔG = 6.2355 * (-2.659) ≈ -16.6 J.

Wait, but earlier using L·atm, I got about -16.6 J, and the option J is -17 J. That's very close. But let me check the exact calculation.

Let me compute ln(0.06997) more accurately.

0.06997 is approximately 0.07.

ln(0.07) is approximately -2.65926.

So 6.2355 J * (-2.65926) = let's calculate it.

6 * (-2.65926) is -15.9556.

0.2355 * (-2.65926) is approximately -0.6255.

Adding together: -15.9556 -0.6255 ≈ -16.581 J.

Which is approximately -16.6 J, so the closest option is J: -17 J? Wait, but the options are in whole numbers. So is it -17 J?

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculations.

Wait, let's compute P1 and P2 more accurately.

n = 0.0025 mol.

R = 8.314 J/mol·K.

T = 300 K.

V1 = 42 cm³ = 0.000042 m³.

P1 = (nRT)/V1 = (0.0025 * 8.314 * 300) / 0.000042.

Compute numerator: 0.0025 *8.314 = 0.020785. Multiply by 300: 6.2355 J.

6.2355 / 0.000042 = 6.2355 / 4.2e-5 = let's compute 6.2355 / 0.000042.

Well, 6.2355 / 0.000042 = 6.2355 * (1/0.000042) = 6.2355 * 23809.524 ≈ let's compute 6 * 23809.524 = 142,857.14, 0.2355 *23809.524≈ 5,610. So total is ~148,467 Pa, which is about 1.465 atm.

Similarly, P2 = (nRT)/V2 = 6.2355 J / 0.0006 m³ = 10,392.5 Pa ≈ 0.1025 atm.

So ln(P2/P1) = ln(0.1025/1.465) = ln(0.06997) ≈ -2.659.

So ΔG = (0.0025 mol)(8.314 J/mol·K)(300 K) * (-2.659)

Compute 0.0025 *8.314 = 0.020785.

0.020785 *300 = 6.2355 J.

6.2355 * (-2.659) ≈ -16.58 J, which is approximately -16.6 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is J: -17 J. But wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct formula. Because I'm using ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1), which gives a negative value because P2 < P1.

Wait, another thought: Wait, for Gibbs free energy, the formula when T is constant is ΔG = VΔP, but that's when pressure is changing. Alternatively, using ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1) is correct for the process.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider that for an ideal gas, the Gibbs free energy change when expanding isothermally is ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1). Wait, wait a second. Because when the volume increases, the Gibbs free energy would be positive if using this formula, but when pressure decreases, the other formula gives a negative ΔG. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the correct formula. I think I might have mixed up the formulas for Helmholtz free energy (ΔA) and Gibbs free energy (ΔG). 

Wait, Helmholtz free energy change at constant T and V is ΔA = -P_ext ΔV, but that's not relevant here. For Gibbs free energy, which is at constant T and P, the relevant equation is ΔG = VΔP. But in this case, the pressure is changing, so perhaps I should use the relation involving pressure.

Alternatively, let me refer back to the formula for Gibbs free energy change for an ideal gas. The general formula is dG = V dP - S dT. At constant temperature, dT = 0, so dG = V dP.

For an ideal gas, V = nRT/P, so substituting, dG = (nRT/P) dP.

Integrating from P1 to P2 at constant T:

ΔG = ∫ (nRT/P) dP from P1 to P2 = nRT ln(P2/P1).

So yes, the correct formula is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1).

So in this case, P2 < P1, so ln(P2/P1) is negative, and ΔG is negative, which makes sense because the system is expanding, and the Gibbs free energy decreases.

So with that in mind, my calculation of approximately -16.6 J is correct, which is closest to option J: -17 J.

Wait, but let me check the exact calculation again. Maybe I approximated too much.

Compute ln(0.06997): Let's use a calculator. Let me compute it precisely.

ln(0.07) is approximately -2.65926.

Now, nRT is 0.0025 * 8.314 * 300 = 0.0025*8.314=0.020785, multiplied by 300: 6.2355 J.

Multiply by ln(P2/P1)= -2.65926.

6.2355 * (-2.65926) = Let's compute 6 * (-2.65926) = -15.9556.

0.2355 * (-2.65926) = approximately -0.6255.

Adding together: -15.9556 -0.6255 = -16.5811 J.

So approximately -16.58 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is J: -17 J. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me check if I used the correct units for R. Because earlier I tried using R as 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) and that also gave me about -16.6 J when converted to J. So both approaches give the same result.

So I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately -16.6 J, which is closest to option J: -17 J.

But wait, looking back at the options, option J is -17 J. So that's the choice.

To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the isothermal expansion of nitrogen gas (N₂), we use the formula:

\[
\Delta G = nRT \ln\left(\frac{P_
