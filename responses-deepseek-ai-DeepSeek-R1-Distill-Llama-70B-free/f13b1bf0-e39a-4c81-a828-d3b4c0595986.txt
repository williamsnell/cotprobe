Okay, so I have this question about aggregate demand and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through this step by step. The question is asking which of the options would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. Hmm, I remember that aggregate demand is the total spending in the economy, and when the curve shifts right, it means more demand at every price level. So I need to find a factor that increases this total spending.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one. 

Option A: Increase in unemployment rates. Wait, if unemployment goes up, that probably means people have less income, so they spend less. That would shift aggregate demand left, not right. So A is probably not the answer.

Option B: Decrease in government spending. Government spending is a component of aggregate demand. If it decreases, that would subtract from the total, shifting the curve left. So B is out.

Option C: Decrease in the supply of money. Money supply affects interest rates. If money supply decreases, interest rates might go up. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, so people spend less on big-ticket items like houses and cars. That would decrease AD, so the curve shifts left. So C is not the right choice.

Option D: Increase in savings. If people save more, they spend less. That's a decrease in consumption, so AD would shift left. D is incorrect.

Option E: Increase in interest rates. Higher interest rates make borrowing more costly, so investment and consumption might drop. That would reduce AD, shifting it left. So E is not the answer.

Option F: Depreciation in the dollar's international value. Oh, wait. If the dollar depreciates, that means it's worth less in foreign exchange. So imports become more expensive, making domestic goods cheaper for foreigners. Exports would increase because our goods are cheaper. More exports mean higher demand, which shifts AD to the right. So F sounds like a good candidate.

Option G: Increase in the price level. Wait, I think the aggregate demand curve actually shows the relationship between price levels and real GDP. So when the price level increases, the quantity of real GDP demanded decreases. That's a movement along the curve, not a shift. So G doesn't cause a shift.

Option H: Decrease in consumer confidence. If people feel less confident, they spend less now and maybe save more. That would decrease consumption, shifting AD left. So H is not the right answer.

Option I: Increase in personal income tax rates. Higher taxes mean people have less disposable income. They can't spend as much, so consumption drops, leading to a leftward shift of AD. So I is incorrect.

So the only option that fits is F. Depreciation of the dollar makes exports increase, boosting AD.

To determine which option shifts the aggregate demand (AD) curve to the right, we analyze how each option affects total spending in the economy. A rightward shift of the AD curve occurs when factors increase consumption, investment, government spending, or net exports.

- **Option A**: An increase in unemployment rates reduces disposable income, leading to lower consumption and a leftward shift of AD.  
- **Option B**: A decrease in government spending directly reduces AD, causing a leftward shift.  
- **Option C**: A decrease in the money supply increases interest rates, reducing borrowing and spending, which shifts AD left.  
- **Option D**: An increase in savings reduces current consumption, decreasing AD and shifting it left.  
- **Option E**: An increase in interest rates makes borrowing more expensive, reducing investment and consumption, shifting AD left.  
- **Option F**: Depreciation in the international value of the dollar makes exports cheaper for foreigners, increasing export demand and boosting AD, shifting it right.  
- **Option G**: An increase in the price level does not shift the AD curve; it represents movement along the curve.  
- **Option H**: A decrease in consumer confidence reduces spending, shifting AD left.  
- **Option I**: An increase in personal income tax rates reduces disposable income, lowering consumption and shifting AD left.  

The only option that increases total spending and shifts the AD curve to the right is **F**.  

Answer: F
