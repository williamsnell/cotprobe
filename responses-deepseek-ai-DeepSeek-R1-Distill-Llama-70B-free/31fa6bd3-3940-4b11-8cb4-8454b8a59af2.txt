She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m2 . Her hemoglobin A1c is 6.2%, and fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 118 mg/dL. Which of the following health maintenance recommendations is most appropriate at this time?

Options:

A: Mammography

H: Human papillomavirus testing

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about a 22-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes. She's come in for a follow-up, feels well. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's go through the patient's history. She's 22, has type 1 diabetes for 2 years, controlled with insulin. Her last Pap smear was normal 3 months ago, and she saw an ophthalmologist 6 months ago. Her grandmother has breast cancer, which is a family history point. Her BMI is 20, which is normal, so probably not overweight-related issues.

Her HbA1c is 6.2%, which is pretty good—under 7% is the target for many with diabetes. Her fingerstick glucose is 118 mg/dL, which is slightly above normal (normal is usually under 100, but for someone with diabetes, this is acceptable).

Now, the question is about health maintenance. What's the most appropriate recommendation now?

Looking at the options:

A: Mammography. She's 22, so way too young for routine mammograms. Guidelines usually start at 40-50, unless high risk. Her grandmother has breast cancer, but she's 67, which is more common. The patient's age is more important here, so probably not A.

B: Dietary modification for weight loss. Her BMI is 20, which is normal. Unless she's underweight, but 20 is mid-normal. She might not need to lose weight. Plus, she's managing her diabetes, so maybe focus is on maintaining good control, not losing weight. So B might not be the best.

C: Screening for cervical cancer. She had a normal Pap smear 3 months ago. Guidelines usually recommend every 3-5 years if previous are normal. But some might do it annually. However, she just had one, so maybe not needed right now. Unless the question is about when to start.

Wait, at what age do they start cervical cancer screening? I think it's at 21. She's 22, so yes, but she just had a normal one three months ago. So maybe she doesn't need another right now.

D: Screening for colon cancer. She's young, 22. Unless she has a family history of colon cancer, which isn't mentioned. Routine colon cancer screening starts around 45 or 50, so probably not D.

E: Influenza virus vaccine. It's October, which is flu season. The flu vaccine is recommended annually for everyone, especially those with chronic conditions like diabetes. So this seems relevant. She should get the flu shot.

F: Routine eye examination. She saw her ophthalmologist 6 months ago. Diabetic retinopathy screening is recommended annually for type 1 diabetes once they've had it for a few years. Wait, she's had it for two years. Oh, wait, for type 1 diabetes, the guidelines say to start screening 3-5 years after diagnosis. So if she was diagnosed two years ago, she might not need it yet. Wait, no—some say start at diagnosis for type 1 because they can have retinopathy even early. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the American Diabetes Association recommends that patients with type 1 diabetes have an initial eye exam by an ophthalmologist or optometrist shortly after the diagnosis. So she's had diabetes for two years, so maybe she's due for a follow-up. But she had an eye exam 6 months ago. So perhaps she doesn't need another right now. So F might not be the best choice.

G: Colonoscopy. Same as D, she's too young unless high risk, which isn't indicated here.

H: Human papillomavirus testing. HPV testing is part of cervical cancer screening, but usually for women over 30. She's 22, so probably not indicated. Plus, she just had a Pap smear.

I: Hepatitis B virus vaccine. She's 22, so she might have received it as a child. Unless she's in a high-risk group, which isn't indicated here. So probably not needed now.

So back to E: Influenza vaccine. It's October, so flu season is starting. The flu vaccine is recommended annually for everyone, especially those with diabetes. So this seems like the most appropriate recommendation.

The patient is a 22-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus, well-controlled with insulin. She has no current complaints and is up to date with a normal Pap smear and an ophthalmology visit within the last 6 months. Her BMI is 20, indicating a normal weight. The question asks for the most appropriate health maintenance recommendation at this time.

**Analysis of options:**

- **A: Mammography**  
  Routine mammography is not recommended for women under 40 unless there is a high-risk family history. While her grandmother has breast cancer, the patient’s age makes this option inappropriate.

- **B: Dietary modification for weight loss**  
  Her BMI is 20, which is within the normal range. There is no indication that she needs to lose weight, especially since her diabetes is well-controlled.

- **C: Screening for cervical cancer**  
  Cervical cancer screening is recommended starting at age 21, but she already had a normal Pap smear 3 months ago. Routine screening is typically done every 3-5 years if previous results are normal, so this is not needed at this time.

- **D: Screening for colon cancer**  
  Colon cancer screening is not recommended for individuals under 45 without a high-risk family history. This is not applicable to her.

- **E: Influenza virus vaccine**  
  The influenza vaccine is recommended annually for all individuals, especially those with chronic conditions like diabetes. Given that it is October, this is the flu season, making this the most appropriate recommendation.

- **F: Routine eye examination**  
  While diabetic retinopathy screening is important, she had an eye exam 6 months ago, and guidelines suggest annual screening for type 1 diabetes. She does not need another exam at this time.

- **G: Colonoscopy**  
  Similar to option D, colonoscopy is not indicated for someone her age without high-risk factors.

- **H: Human papillomavirus testing**  
  HPV testing is typically recommended for women over 30 as part of cervical cancer screening. This is not appropriate for her at this time.

- **I: Hepatitis B virus vaccine**  
  Hepatitis B vaccination is usually completed in childhood or early adulthood unless there is a specific high-risk indication, which is not present here.

**Conclusion:** The most appropriate recommendation is the influenza virus vaccine, as it is flu season and she has a chronic condition that increases her risk of complications from influenza.

**Answer:** E
