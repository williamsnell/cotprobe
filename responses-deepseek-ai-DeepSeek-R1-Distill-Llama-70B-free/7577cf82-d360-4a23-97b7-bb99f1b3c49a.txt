Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the real eigenvalues of a matrix. Hmm, I remember eigenvalues are scalars λ such that Ax = λx for some non-zero vector x. But wait, how do I actually compute them for a given matrix?

The matrix given is a 3x3 one: [[3, -2, 5], [1, 0, 7], [0, 0, 2]]. Oh right, eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(A - λI) = 0. So I need to construct the matrix A - λI, compute its determinant, and solve for λ.

Let me write out A - λI. The matrix A is:

3  -2  5
1   0  7
0   0  2

Subtracting λ from the diagonal elements, it becomes:

(3-λ)  -2     5
1     (0-λ)   7
0      0     (2-λ)

Now, the determinant of this matrix needs to be zero. So I'll calculate the determinant. Since this is a 3x3 matrix, I can use expansion by minors or maybe look for patterns that make it easier.

Wait, looking at the last row: [0, 0, (2-λ)]. If I expand along the third row, that might simplify things because there are two zeros. The determinant would be 0*(minor) + 0*(minor) + (2-λ)*det(minor of (2-λ)). So the determinant is (2-λ) multiplied by the determinant of the top-left 2x2 matrix.

The top-left 2x2 matrix when excluding the third row and column is:
[(3-λ)  -2]
[1     (0-λ)]

So the determinant of this 2x2 matrix is (3-λ)(-λ) - (-2)(1) = -λ(3-λ) + 2.

Let me compute that: -3λ + λ² + 2. So the determinant of the 3x3 matrix is (2-λ) * (λ² -3λ +2) = 0.

Setting this equal to zero, the equation becomes (2-λ)(λ² -3λ +2) = 0. So the eigenvalues are λ = 2 and the roots of λ² -3λ +2 = 0.

Solving the quadratic equation λ² -3λ +2 =0: using the quadratic formula, λ = [3 ± sqrt(9 -8)] / 2 = [3 ± 1]/2. So λ = (3+1)/2=2 and (3-1)/2=1. Wait, so the roots are 2 and 1. But wait, 2 is already a root from the first factor. So the eigenvalues are 1, 2, and 2? Wait, no, wait: let me double-check.

Wait no, the equation is (2-λ)(λ² -3λ +2) = 0. The first factor gives λ=2. The second factor is λ² -3λ +2 = 0, which factors into (λ-1)(λ-2) =0, so roots at λ=1 and λ=2. So the eigenvalues are 1, 2, and 2. So the real eigenvalues are 1, 2, and another 2. But looking at the options, none of them list three eigenvalues. Wait, the options are pairs. Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the real eigenvalues, but maybe all are real, so perhaps they want all, but the options are given as pairs. Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are A through J, each is a pair of numbers. But the matrix is 3x3, so three eigenvalues.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate the determinant.

The matrix is:
[(3-λ) -2    5   ]
[1   (0-λ)   7   ]
[0     0    (2-λ)]

So the determinant is calculated as the product of the main diagonal elements if it's upper triangular, but wait, it's not exactly upper triangular because the 5 and 7 are present. Oh wait, no, the third row is [0 0 (2-λ)], so when expanding along the third row, the determinant is (2-λ) multiplied by the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing the third row and column.

Yes, so the submatrix is:
[ (3-λ)   -2 ]
[ 1      -λ ]

So determinant of submatrix is (3-λ)(-λ) - (-2)(1) = -3λ + λ² + 2.

So the overall determinant is (2-λ)(λ² -3λ +2) = 0.

Which factors into (2-λ)(λ-1)(λ-2) = 0.

Wait, because λ² -3λ +2 factors into (λ-1)(λ-2). So the equation is (2-λ)(λ-1)(λ-2) = 0. So the roots are λ=2, λ=1, λ=2. So the eigenvalues are 1, 2, and 2. So the real eigenvalues are 1 and 2 (with multiplicity two for 2, but perhaps the options don't consider multiplicity.

Now, looking at the options, each option is a pair of numbers, but the matrix has three eigenvalues. Wait, perhaps the matrix is 3x3, but in the question, perhaps the options list all real eigenvalues, but maybe some options only have two, so perhaps 2 is a repeated eigenvalue.

Wait, the question says "the real eigenvalues" which are 1, 2, and 2. So the eigenvalues are 1, 2, and 2. But the options provided are all pairs, not triplets.

Looking at the options again:

A: [1, 2]

B: [3, -2]

C: [2,5]

D: [3,7]

E: [1,3]

F: [3,2]

G: [-2,5]

H: [1,7]

I: [6,2]

J: [1,6]

So the eigenvalues we found are 1,2,2. So the real eigenvalues are 1,2. Since in the options, option A is [1,2], which are the distinct real eigenvalues. But wait, do they count multiplicity? The question says "real eigenvalues", so perhaps it's listing all, but since the options are pairs, maybe each option is a set of eigenvalues, but since 2 is repeated, perhaps the correct option is the one with 1 and 2.

So the correct answer would include both 1 and 2. So looking at the options, option A is [1,2], which fits. Option F is [3,2], but 3 isn't an eigenvalue here.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The determinant equation was (2-λ)(λ² -3λ +2)=0. So λ=2, and λ=1 and 2 again. So the eigenvalues are 1, 2, 2. So the real eigenvalues are 1,2,2. But the options don't have three elements, so perhaps the intended answer is the set {1,2}, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the distinct eigenvalues, so 1 and 2. Thus, option A is correct.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the matrix has another structure. Let's see, the matrix is upper triangular because all elements below the main diagonal are zero except for the (2,1) element which is 1, but wait, no: the element (2,1) is 1, which is below the diagonal. So the matrix isn't upper triangular, but the third row is [0 0 2], so perhaps the matrix is block triangular. Let me check.

Looking at the matrix:

Row 1: 3, -2, 5

Row 2: 1, 0,7

Row 3: 0,0,2

So the submatrix in the bottom right is 1x1: 2. So the eigenvalues include 2. The submatrix excluding the third row and column is the 2x2 matrix:

[3, -2]

[1, 0]

The eigenvalues of this 2x2 matrix can be found by solving (3-λ)(-λ) - (-2)(1) =0 → -3λ + λ² +2 =0 → λ²-3λ+2=0 → λ=1 and λ=2.

So the eigenvalues of the entire 3x3 matrix are 2 (from the bottom right) and 1 and 2 (from the 2x2 block), so 1,2,2. So the real eigenvalues are 1,2,2. So when the question asks "what are the real eigenvalues", the answer should include 1,2,2. But the options only have pairs. So perhaps the intended answer is the set {1,2}, which is option A.

So I think the correct answer is option A: [1,2].
</think>

To find the real eigenvalues of the matrix 

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
3 & -2 & 5 \\ 
1 & 0 & 7 \\ 
0 & 0 & 2 
\end{bmatrix},
\]

we solve the characteristic equation \(\det(A - \lambda I) = 0\). Subtracting \(\lambda\) from the diagonal elements of \(A\), we get:

\[
A - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} 
3-\lambda & -2 & 5 \\ 
1 & -\lambda & 7 \\ 
0 & 0 & 2-\lambda 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant of this matrix is calculated by expanding along the third row, which contains two zeros:

\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = (2-\lambda) \cdot \det\begin{bmatrix} 
3-\lambda & -2 \\ 
1 & -\lambda 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant of the \(2 \times 2\) submatrix is:

\[
(3-\lambda)(-\lambda) - (-2)(1) = -3\lambda + \lambda^2 + 2.
\]

Thus, the determinant of \(A - \lambda I\) is:

\[
(2-\lambda)(\lambda^2 - 3\lambda + 2).
\]

Factoring \(\lambda^2 - 3\lambda + 2\), we get:

\[
\lambda^2 - 3\lambda + 2 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 2).
\]

The characteristic equation becomes:

\[
(2-\lambda)(\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 2) = 0.
\]

This gives the eigenvalues \(\lambda = 2, 1, 2\). Therefore, the real eigenvalues of the matrix are \(1, 2, 2\). Since the question asks for the real eigenvalues and the options are given as pairs, the distinct real eigenvalues are \(1\) and \(2\). 

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A: [1, 2].**
