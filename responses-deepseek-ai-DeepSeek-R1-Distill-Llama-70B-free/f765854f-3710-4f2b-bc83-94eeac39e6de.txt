Question:

A major problem in thinking is maintaining alertness or concentration. What have experimental findings demonstrated about this problem?

Options:

A: The human mind can easily concentrate for long periods of time.
B: Concentration is unaffected by external distractions if the subject is engaging enough.
C: Attention can be sustained indefinitely if the subject is of personal interest.
D: The human system responds poorly to novelty or change in stimuli.
E: Frequent breaks diminish the ability to focus on tasks.
F: It is difficult to maintain attention for a long time on one particular subject or source of stimulation.
G: The human system shows increased alertness in response to monotonous stimuli.
H: Alertness is constant and does not fluctuate throughout the day.
I: The mind is better at multitasking than focusing on a single task for an extended period.
J: Concentration improves with time.

Okay, so I've got this question here about maintaining alertness and concentration. Hmm. Let me think about what I know. The question is asking what experimental findings have shown regarding this problem. The options are from A to J.

I remember that sustained attention is a topic in psychology. People often have trouble keeping their focus on one thing for a long time. There's something about the mind wandering or getting distracted easily. Oh wait, I think it's related to attention spans. Like, after a while, our concentration starts to wane.

Looking at the options: 

Option A says the mind can easily concentrate for long periods. That doesn't sound right. I think the opposite is true; people struggle with long focus times.

Option B says concentration isn't affected by distractions if the subject is engaging. No, even if you're interested, if there are distractions, it's harder to concentrate. So B might not be correct.

Option C claims attention can be sustained indefinitely if the subject is interesting. I don't think so. Even if you love something, you'll eventually get tired or your focus will drop.

Option D says the system responds poorly to novelty. Wait, I thought people get distracted by new or novel stimuli. Like, if something new happens, it grabs attention, so D seems incorrect.

Option E suggests frequent breaks reduce focus ability. I'm not sure. I remember that breaks can help, like in the Pomodoro technique, but E says they diminish ability, which might not be accurate.

Option F states it's difficult to maintain attention on one subject for a long time. That rings a bell. Because the mind tends to wander and needs variety, so F seems correct.

Option G claims alertness increases with monotonous stimuli. No, monotony usually decreases alertness because it's boring.

Option H says alertness is constant. Definitely not. Alertness varies throughout the day, like the circadian rhythm.

Option I says the mind is better at multitasking. No, studies show multitasking reduces productivity because you can't focus well on one task.

Option J says concentration improves over time. I don't think so; without breaks or changes, it tends to decline.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be F. Because experiments show that sustaining attention on a single task for a long time is challenging.

The correct answer is F. Experimental findings have shown that maintaining attention on one particular subject or source of stimulation for a long time is difficult due to factors like mind wandering and the need for varied stimuli.

Answer: F
