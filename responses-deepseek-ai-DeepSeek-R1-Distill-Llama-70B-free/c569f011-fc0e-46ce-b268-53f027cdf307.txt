Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about making different ice cream cones. Each cone can hold two ice cream balls. I have 6 flavors of ice cream and 5 types of cones. I need to find out how many different cones I can make. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm, so each cone has two balls. I remember that when you're choosing items where order doesn't matter, it's a combination problem. Like, if I have 6 flavors, how many ways can I choose 2 without caring about the order. Oh wait, because in a cone, the order of the two balls probably doesn't matter. Like, chocolate and vanilla is the same as vanilla and chocolate on a cone.

So for the ice cream part, the number of possible combinations would be the combination of 6 flavors taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!)). So here, n is 6 and k is 2. Let me calculate that.

6! is 720, but wait, I can cancel out terms. 6!/(2! * 4!) = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15. So there are 15 possible combinations for the ice cream.

But wait, wait a second. What if someone wants two of the same flavor? Like two chocolate balls in a cone. Because the question says each cone can contain two ice cream balls, but it doesn't specify that they have to be different. So in that case, allowing for repetition, the calculation would be different.

Ah right, if repetition is allowed, then the number of ways to choose the two balls is a permutation with repetition. So the formula is n^k, where n is the number of options and k is the number of choices. Here, n=6 and k=2, so 6^2 = 36. Wait, but in this case, since the two balls are in a cone and order doesn't matter, maybe it's different.

Wait, no, because in the case of two different flavors, choosing A then B is the same as B then A. But if you allow the same flavor twice, then each unique pair (like A and B) is one combination, and each single flavor (like A and A) is another.

So actually, the total number of ways to choose the ice cream would be the number of combinations with repetition allowed. The formula for combinations with repetition is (n + k -1 choose k). So n is 6, k is 2, so (6+2-1 choose 2) = 7 choose 2. 7*6/(2*1) = 21. So 21 different ways for the ice cream.

Wait, but I'm getting confused now. Let me think again. If the two ice cream balls can be same or different, how do we calculate that.

Wait, when order doesn't matter and repetition is allowed, the number of combinations is (n+k-1 choose k). So in this case, n=6, k=2. So (6+2-1) choose 2 = 7 choose 2 = 21. So that's 21 possibilities for the ice cream.

But wait, another approach: for each cone, the first ball can be any of 6 flavors, and the second can be any of 6 again. So 6*6=36. But since the order doesn't matter (because it's a cone, not a sequence), we have to adjust for that.

Wait, for two different flavors, AB and BA are the same. So 36 includes all ordered pairs. The number of unordered pairs would be (36 - 6)/2 + 6 = (30/2) +6= 15 +6=21. Because the 6 cases where both are same (AA, BB, etc.) are unique and don't have duplicates. So yeah, 21.

So ice cream possibilities: 21.

Now, for each of these 21 ice cream combinations, you can choose any of the 5 types of cones. So for each ice cream choice, 5 options.

So total cones would be 21 *5 =105.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 105. Let me check the options again.

Options are A:120, B:150, C:60, D:210, E:360, F:300, G:72, H:240, I:180, J:90. Hmm, 105 isn't there. So maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the ice cream combinations. Let me go back.

Alternative approach: Each cone has two balls, which can be same or different. So, for the ice cream, how many possibilities are there?

If order doesn't matter, and repetition is allowed, it's combinations with repetition: (n +k -1 choose k) = (6+2-1 choose 2)=7 choose 2=21. So that part seems right.

But then cones are 5, so 21*5=105. Not in the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't allow the same flavor twice. So each cone must have two different balls.

In that case, the number would be 6 choose 2 =15 for the ice cream. Then 15 *5 cones=75. But 75 isn't an option either.

Wait, the options don't have 75 or 105. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps each cone can have up to two balls, but you can also have just one. But the way the question is phrased is "each cone can contain two ice cream balls", which implies that each cone has exactly two. So the two-ball case is mandatory.

So perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the options don't have 105. So maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the order of the ice cream balls in the cone. Like, a cone with chocolate first and vanilla second is different from vanilla first and chocolate second. But that seems unlikely because cones are just containers; the arrangement doesn't typically matter.

But just in case, let's calculate that scenario. If order matters and repetition is allowed, then the number of possibilities for ice cream is 6*6=36. Then 36*5=180, which matches option I.

But the question is, does the order matter? The problem doesn't specify any particular order, so I think order doesn't matter, which would make the correct answer 105. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended interpretation is that order does matter.

Wait, let me reevaluate. The problem says you can make different cones. So what makes a cone different? The type of cone (5 options) and the flavors in it.

If the two ice creams are arranged in a particular order, like a stack, maybe their sequence matters. For example, a cone with chocolate on the bottom and vanilla on top could be considered different from vanilla on bottom and chocolate on top. But in reality, when you eat a cone, the order of the scoops might matter in terms of taste experience, but for the purpose of this question, perhaps the problem considers them the same.

Wait, but the question is about "different" cones. If the order of the scoops doesn't matter, then it's 21*5=105. But since 105 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is when order matters, leading to 36*5=180, which is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the ice cream selection is without repetition, meaning you have to choose two different flavors. So 6 choose 2=15. Then 15*5=75, which isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps the original approach was incorrect. Maybe each cone can have two balls, but you can choose any number of balls, including one. But the question says each cone can contain two, implying exactly two.

Alternatively, perhaps the two balls are required to be different. So each cone has two different flavors. So 6 choose 2 is 15. Then 15 cones times 5 types gives 75. But again, 75 isn't an option.

Hmm, maybe I need to consider that the same flavor can be used twice, but whether the order matters.

Wait, another approach: some cones may have two different, others same.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I didn't account for the possibility of choosing the same flavor twice. So the ice cream selection is with replacement, but whether the order matters.

If order matters: 6 options for first ball, 6 for second, total 36.

But if order doesn't matter, then (36 +6)/2=21 (Wait, no, more accurately, when order doesn't matter, the number is (n^2 +n)/2 when considering same and different. Wait, no, I think earlier calculation was 21.

Wait, but if the problem treats same-flavor cones as different based on order, then 36 ice cream options, times 5 cones, gives 180, which is option I.

But I'm not sure. Since the question doesn't specify whether order matters, perhaps the default is that it doesn't, leading to 21*5=105, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is 6*5* (number of ways for two balls), considering order.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the problem allows any number of ice cream balls, but the question says each cone can contain two. So exactly two balls.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 6 flavors can be arranged in some ordered way in the cone, so for each cone type, the number of ice cream arrangements is 6P2 = 6*5=30 (since order matters and no repetition). Then 30*5=150, which is option B.

Wait, but if you can have two same flavors, then 6*6=36. 36*5=180, option I.

Alternatively, the problem might be considering that you can have two same or different, but order doesn't matter. So 21 ice cream options, 5 cones, 105. But no option for that.

Wait, perhaps the question is that each cone can have up to two, meaning you can have one or two balls. So the total would be the number of ways to have one ball plus two balls.

If that's the case, for one ball: 6 options. For two balls: 21 options (same or different, order doesn't matter). So 6 +21=27 ice cream options. Then 27*5=135. But that's not an option either.

Wait, the options given don't include 105 or 135. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the cones are considered different based on the arrangement of the two balls, so order matters. Then ice cream arrangements would be 6*6=36. 36*5=180, which is option I.

Alternatively, maybe the problem allows choosing any number of balls, but the question says each cone can contain two, which suggests exactly two.

So if order matters, 36*5=180, which is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that each cone has two balls, and the order doesn't matter, but the calculation is 15 (for different flavors) +6 (for same flavors) =21. So 21*5=105, but that's not an option.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option I is 180, which is 36*5. So perhaps the intended approach is to consider order.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that each flavor can be used once, and the two balls are in a specific order, so 6*5=30 ways for the ice cream (permutations of 6 flavors taken 2 at a time), then 30*5=150, which is option B.

Wait, but that would be the case if repetition is not allowed. So each cone has two different flavors, order matters.

So 6 choices for the first ball, 5 for the second: 30. Times 5 cones: 150, option B.

The question is, does the problem allow the same flavor to be used twice?

The question states that each cone can contain two ice cream balls. It doesn't specify whether they have to be different. So perhaps same flavors are allowed.

In that case, if order matters, it's 36 ice cream options. 36*5=180, which is option I.

But I'm not sure. Because the problem could be interpreted in different ways.

Wait, another approach: some of the answer options can be calculated based on different approaches.

Option B is 150, which would be 6P2 *5 cones. 6P2 is 30, 30*5=150.

Option I is 180, which is 6^2 *5=36*5=180.

So the answer would depend on whether order matters and whether repetition is allowed.

Given that the question is about making different cones, perhaps the intended interpretation is that each cone can have any two balls, same or different, and order doesn't matter. So 21*5=105, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the intended approach is to allow order to matter, leading to 36*5=180, which is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the two balls are always different and order doesn't matter. So 15*5=75, which isn't an option.

Wait, but in the given options, 180 is present. So perhaps the intended answer is 180. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering that each cone can have two balls, and each ball is selected independently. So for two balls, you have 6 options for each, making 36. Then multiply by 5 cones, giving 180.

Yes, that would make sense. So the correct answer would be option I:180.

To determine how many different ice cream cones can be made, we analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Ice Cream Combinations**:  
   - Each cone can contain exactly two ice cream balls.  
   - There are 6 flavors of ice cream, and the problem does not explicitly state that the two balls must be different. Therefore, repetition of flavors is allowed.  
   - If order matters (e.g., chocolate first and vanilla second is different from vanilla first and chocolate second), the number of possible combinations is calculated as permutations with repetition:  
     \[
     6 \times 6 = 36
     \]  
   - If order does not matter, the number of combinations is calculated as combinations with repetition:  
     \[
     \binom{6 + 2 - 1}{2} = \binom{7}{2} = 21
     \]  

2. **Cone Types**:  
   - There are 5 types of cones.  
   - For each ice cream combination, there are 5 choices of cones.  

3. **Total Number of Cones**:  
   - If order matters (36 ice cream combinations), the total number of cones is:  
     \[
     36 \times 5 = 180
     \]  
   - If order does not matter (21 ice cream combinations), the total number of cones is:  
     \[
     21 \times 5 = 105
     \]  

4. **Final Answer**:  
   - The problem does not explicitly state whether the order of the ice cream balls matters. However, since 105 is not one of the answer options, it is likely that the intended interpretation is that order matters.  
   - Therefore, the total number of different cones is:  
     \[
     180
     \]  

The correct answer is **I: 180**.
