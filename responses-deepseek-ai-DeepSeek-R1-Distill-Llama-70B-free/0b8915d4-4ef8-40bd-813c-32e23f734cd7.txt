The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A purchaser orally agreed with the seller to buy seller's house for $100,000. The purchaser gave the seller a written offer and a post-dated check for 5% of the price. Before the seller signed the offer form or deposited the check, he received an offer of his full asking price of $120,000 from another party. The seller called the purchaser and called the deal off. The purchaser sued for specific performance on the basis that the oral understanding, along with the written offer and the check, constituted an enforceable agreement. Will the purchaser likely prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the check served as a form of acceptance of the offer.
B: Yes, because there was an oral agreement and the check for the down payment was evidence of consideration being paid.
C: Yes, because the seller cannot revoke an offer once a down payment has been made.
D: No, because the oral agreement was not legally binding without the seller's signature on the offer form.
E: No, because the offer was not accepted  prior to an acceptance the seller had the right to sell to anyone.
F: Yes, because the written offer and check constituted a legally binding contract.
G: Yes, because the buyer and seller had a meeting of the minds evidenced by their oral understanding, the check and the written offer.
H: No, because specific performance does not apply in a residential real estate transaction.
I: No, because the seller had not yet cashed the check, indicating no formal acceptance of the offer.
J: No, because the post-dated check does not constitute a legally binding agreement.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically regarding real estate purchases. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that a purchaser orally agreed with a seller to buy a house for $100,000. The purchaser then gave the seller a written offer and a post-dated check for 5% of the price. But before the seller signed the offer or deposited the check, the seller got another offer for the full asking price of $120,000. The seller called the purchaser to cancel the deal. Now, the purchaser is suing for specific performance, claiming that the oral understanding along with the written offer and check made an enforceable agreement.

Hmm, so the key issues here are whether an enforceable contract was formed, and if so, whether specific performance is applicable.

First, I remember that in real estate transactions, the Statute of Frauds requires contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. So any oral agreement might not be sufficient on its own. But the purchaser gave a written offer, so maybe that covers it. 

Wait, but the seller didn't sign the offer yet. So the offer was made by the purchaser, but the seller hadn't accepted it. Normally, an offer can be revoked any time before acceptance. But what about when the purchaser gave a check? Could that affect the revocability?

I'm trying to recall the rules about offers and consideration. If the offer is an option, it can't be revoked, but an option usually requires consideration. The check here is a post-dated check for 5% of the price, which might be considered as consideration. So maybe by providing the check, the purchaser created an option contract, making the offer irrevocable for a certain period.

Wait, but the check is post-dated. Does that matter? I think the fact that it's post-dated might not invalidate it as consideration because the seller could still deposit it on the date. So perhaps the check serves as consideration, creating an option.

If that's the case, then the seller can't revoke the offer once the consideration (the check) was given. So the seller's subsequent offer to another party might not be valid because the original offer was still open and binding.

But wait, another angle: in some jurisdictions, for real estate, even if there's a written offer and consideration (like a deposit), the contract isn't enforceable until the seller accepts by signing. So without the seller's signature, maybe there's no contract yet, and the seller can revoke the offer.

Wait, but the Statute of Frauds requires a writing signed by the party to be charged (here, the seller) for it to be enforceable. So even if the purchaser gave a written offer and a check, without the seller's signature, the contract isn't formed yet. So the seller could still revoke the offer before acceptance.

But then, does the giving of the check affect this? If the check is consideration for an option, then the offer becomes irrevocable without needing the seller's signature. So the seller can't back out once the option is created.

Alternatively, maybe the written offer plus the check, which acts as a deposit, creates a binding contract. But I'm not sure if the Statute of Frauds would require the seller's signature regardless of the consideration.

Wait, the Statute of Frauds for real estate requires a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. So in this case, the seller didn't sign anything. So even with the check, without the seller's signature, the contract isn't enforceable. So the seller can revoke the offer before acceptance.

So in this case, the purchaser gave a written offer, but the seller didn't accept it. The check was given as part of the offer, but without the seller's acceptance, it's not a contract yet. Therefore, the seller could revoke the offer when a better one came along.

So, for specific performance, the purchaser would need an enforceable contract. Without the seller's acceptance (signing the offer), there's no contract. The offer was revoked before acceptance, so the purchaser can't enforce it.

Looking at the options:

Option E says no because the offer wasn't accepted, so seller could sell to anyone. That makes sense.

Option I says no because the seller hadn't cashed the check, so no formal acceptance. That also seems related.

Option D says no because the oral agreement wasn't binding without the seller's signature on the offer. That also seems correct.

Wait, but the written offer was given, but the seller didn't sign it. So the offer was in writing, but unsigned. So the problem is that without the seller's acceptance, the offer is revocable. So the key is whether the offer was revoked before acceptance.

So the answer would be E: No, because the offer wasn't accepted prior to the seller's right to revoke and sell to another.

Alternatively, option D focuses on the oral agreement not being binding without the seller's signature. But the written offer was made, so maybe D isn't the best fit.

Wait, the written offer was given, but the seller didn't sign. So the issue is that the offer was revoked before acceptance, so no contract was formed. Therefore, specific performance isn't available because there's no enforceable contract.

So the correct answer would be E.

The question revolves around whether an enforceable contract was formed between the purchaser and the seller, allowing the purchaser to sue for specific performance. The key points are as follows:

1. **Oral Agreement and Statute of Frauds**: While there was an oral understanding, the Statute of Frauds requires real estate contracts to be in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought (the seller in this case). Without the seller's signature, the oral agreement alone is not enforceable.

2. **Written Offer and Post-Dated Check**: The purchaser provided a written offer and a post-dated check for 5% of the price. However, the seller neither signed the offer nor deposited the check. Under contract law, an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance. The seller's failure to sign the offer or deposit the check means there was no acceptance, and thus no enforceable contract.

3. **Consideration and Option Contracts**: The post-dated check might be considered as consideration, potentially creating an option contract. However, the analysis hinges on whether the offer was revoked before acceptance. Since the seller revoked the offer before accepting it, the offer was no longer binding, regardless of the check.

4. **Revocation of Offer**: The seller's right to revoke the offer before acceptance is a fundamental principle of contract law. The subsequent offer from another party for the full asking price ($120,000) highlights that the seller exercised this right.

Given these points, the purchaser cannot prevail because the offer was revoked before acceptance, and no enforceable contract was formed. The correct answer is:

E: No, because the offer was not accepted — prior to an acceptance, the seller had the right to sell to anyone.

Answer: E
