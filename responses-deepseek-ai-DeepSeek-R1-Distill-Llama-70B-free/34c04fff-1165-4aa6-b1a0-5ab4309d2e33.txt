Okay, so I have this statistics problem here about calculating the standard deviation of the weights of packed boxes. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says a publisher uses standard boxes for shipping books. There are three components contributing to the weight of each packed box: the books, the box itself, and the packing material.

Let me list out what each component's mean and standard deviation are.

First, the books. The mean weight of the books packed per box is 25 pounds, and the standard deviation is 2 pounds. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way it's written might be a bit confusing. Let me read it again. Oh, right: "The mean weight of books packed per box is 25 pounds, with a standard deviation of two pounds." So that's one component.

Then, the box. The mean weight of the boxes is one pound, with a standard deviation of 0.15 pounds. Okay, that's the second component.

Third, the packing material. The mean weight is two pounds, with a standard deviation of 0.25 pounds. Got it.

So, the total weight of a packed box would be the sum of these three components: books + box + packing material. But wait, wait—no, actually, the books are packed per box, so each box has its own books, and then the box itself, and the packing material. So the total weight is books plus box plus packing. So each of these is a separate random variable contributing to the total.

We need to find the standard deviation of the total weight of the packed boxes. Hmm, right. So when you have independent variables, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances. That's because Var(X + Y + Z) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + Var(Z) when X, Y, Z are independent. But if they're not independent, you have to account for covariances. But I think in this problem, we can assume independence because nothing suggests otherwise.

So, the first step is to find the variance of each component, then add them up, and then take the square root to get the standard deviation of the total.

Let me compute each variance.

Books: mean 25 lb, std dev 2 lb. Variance is (std dev)^2, so 2^2 = 4.

Box: mean 1 lb, std dev 0.15 lb. Variance is (0.15)^2 = 0.0225.

Packing material: mean 2 lb, std dev 0.25 lb. Variance is (0.25)^2 = 0.0625.

So the total variance is 4 + 0.0225 + 0.0625. Let's add those up.

4 + 0.0225 is 4.0225, plus 0.0625 makes 4.085.

So the variance of the total weight is 4.085 lb². Now, the standard deviation is the square root of that.

So sqrt(4.085) is approximately what? Let me think. I remember that sqrt(4) is 2, and sqrt(4.084) would be a bit more. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Well, 2.02 squared is (2 + 0.02)^2 = 4 + 0.08 + 0.0004 = 4.0804. That's less than 4.085. 2.02^2 = 4.0804.

What about 2.021^2? Let's compute 2.021 * 2.021. Let's break it down:

(2 + 0.021)^2 = 4 + 2*(2)*(0.021) + (0.021)^2 = 4 + 0.084 + 0.000441 = 4.084441.

So that's very close to 4.085. So 2.021^2 is approximately 4.0844, which is just a bit less than 4.085. The actual sqrt(4.085) would be a little more than 2.021. Let me approximate it. Let's see how much more.

The difference between 4.085 and 4.084441 is 0.000559. So each increment in the third decimal place adds about 2*(2.021)*0.001 + (0.001)^2 to the square. Let me compute that.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use linear approximation. Let's let x = 2.021. Then, x^2 = 4.084441. We want to find x + δ such that (x + δ)^2 = 4.085.

Expanding, x² + 2x δ + δ² ≈ 4.085. Since δ is small, δ² is negligible. So 4.084441 + 2*(2.021)*δ ≈ 4.085. Subtract 4.084441:

2*(2.021)*δ ≈ 4.085 - 4.084441 → 0.000559.

So 4.042 * δ ≈ 0.000559 → δ ≈ 0.000559 / 4.042 ≈ approximately 0.0001384.

So adding that to x gives x + δ ≈ 2.021 + 0.0001384 ≈ 2.02114. So sqrt(4.085) ≈ 2.02114, which is approximately 2.0211.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options given are:

A: 28.000 pounds
B: 1.950 pounds
C: 2.500 pounds
D: 4.085 pounds
E: 3.012 pounds
F: 3.500 pounds
G: 5.290 pounds
H: 2.021 pounds
I: 2.250 pounds
J: 1.785 pounds

So option H is 2.021 pounds, which matches our calculation. That must be the correct answer.

To determine the standard deviation of the weights of the packed boxes, we need to calculate the total variance of the weights of the three components (books, box, and packing material) and then take the square root of the total variance.

### Step 1: Variance of Each Component
1. **Books**:  
   Mean weight = 25 pounds, Standard deviation = 2 pounds.  
   Variance = \( (2)^2 = 4 \, \text{lb}^2 \).

2. **Box**:  
   Mean weight = 1 pound, Standard deviation = 0.15 pounds.  
   Variance = \( (0.15)^2 = 0.0225 \, \text{lb}^2 \).

3. **Packing Material**:  
   Mean weight = 2 pounds, Standard deviation = 0.25 pounds.  
   Variance = \( (0.25)^2 = 0.0625 \, \text{lb}^2 \).

### Step 2: Total Variance
Since the components are independent, the total variance is the sum of the variances:  
\[
\text{Total Variance} = 4 + 0.0225 + 0.0625 = 4.085 \, \text{lb}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Standard Deviation
The standard deviation is the square root of the total variance:  
\[
\text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{4.085} \approx 2.021 \, \text{pounds}.
\]

### Final Answer
From the given options, the closest match to the calculated standard deviation is **2.021 pounds**, which corresponds to option **H**.
