Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about calculating the minimum depth to lay water pipes so they don't freeze when there's a sudden cold snap. Let's break down what I remember and try to apply it here.

First, the problem states that the mean winter temperature is 7°C. Wait, but then the air temperature drops to -8°C and stays there for 60 hours. So I guess the ground's temperature isn't the same as the air, right? I remember something about heat transfer in the ground and frost penetration. Oh right, it's related to how far frost can penetrate into the soil based on the temperature difference and the time it's exposed to those temperatures.

I think the formula involved here has to do with the depth of frost penetration. I vaguely recall that the depth depends on the temperature difference, the time, and some properties of the soil. Oh wait, there's a formula for the depth of freezing in soil, which is something like the square root of (time) multiplied by some constants involving the temperature difference.

Let me try to recall the exact formula. I think it's something like:

d = sqrt( (2 * α * t * (T_s - T_0)) / (L * ρ) ) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up variables. Another thought: the formula for the depth of frost penetration might be based on thermal diffusivity and the Stefan number, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: I think the formula is d = sqrt( (k * t) / (ρ * L) ) * (T_s - T_0), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I might have the Stefan equation in mind, which is used for phase change problems.

Wait, I think the formula for the depth of frost penetration is given by:

d = sqrt( (2 * α * t * (T_s - T_0)) )

But I'm not certain. Let me think again. Oh right, the formula involves the thermal diffusivity (α), time (t), and the temperature difference. Wait, but I might be missing some other terms, like latent heat or specific heat.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = sqrt( (2 * α * t * (T_s - T_0)) / (L * ρ) ) ), but I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the formula is d = ( (T_s - T_0) * sqrt( (k * t) / (ρ * L) ) ) ?

No, I'm getting stuck on the exact formula. Maybe I should think of it as a one-dimensional heat conduction problem with a phase change (freezing). Stefan's problem comes into play here, where we calculate how far the freezing front moves into the ground over time.

In Stefan's problem for a semi-infinite solid, the depth of the freezing front (d) at time t is given by:

d = sqrt( (2 * α * t * (T_s - T_m)) )

But wait, α is the thermal diffusivity, T_s is the surface temperature, and T_m is the melting point (which is 0°C in this case). But wait, the problem here is that the ground initially is at a higher temperature than the air, and the air's temperature drops suddenly. So the ground's initial temperature is probably higher than the air's new temperature.

Wait, the mean winter temperature is 7°C, but does that mean the ground is at that temperature before the cold snap? Or is the ground at a higher temperature initially? Oh, I think the ground's initial temperature would be higher than the air temperature because the air is cooling down. So before the cold snap, the ground is at 7°C, and then the air drops to -8°C. So the temperature difference (T_s - T_initial) would be from -8°C to 0°C, because the freezing point of water is 0°C.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The ground starts at 7°C, but the surface temperature drops to -8°C. So the temperature difference driving the freezing is from 7°C down to 0°C, because once the ground reaches 0°C, it can start to freeze. But wait, maybe I should consider the temperature difference between the air and the initial ground temperature.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the temperature difference as (T_initial - T_surface). Since the ground is initially at 7°C, and the surface is cooled to -8°C. But the freezing occurs when the ground reaches 0°C. So the temperature difference would be from 7°C to 0°C, which is 7 degrees. But wait, no, because the surface is at -8°C, so the temperature difference is larger than that.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's think carefully. The ground is at 7°C initially. The air temperature drops to -8°C, which would cause the ground's surface to cool. The heat will flow from the warmer ground to the cooler air, causing the ground's temperature to drop. The depth to which the ground freezes depends on how far this cold wave can penetrate in the given time (60 hours) before the pipes freeze.

Wait, but pipes are usually buried deeper than the frost penetration depth. So the idea is to find how deep the frost will penetrate into the soil, and then the pipes need to be below that depth to avoid freezing.

So the question reduces to calculating the frost penetration depth given the temperature conditions and time.

I think the formula for frost penetration depth (d) is given by:

d = sqrt( (2 * α * t * (T_s - T_0)) / (L * ρ) ) )

Where:
- α is the thermal diffusivity of the soil,
- t is the time,
- T_s is the surface temperature,
- T_0 is the initial temperature of the soil,
- L is the latent heat of fusion for water,
- ρ is the density of the soil.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I have all the constants right. Alternatively, another version of the formula is:

d = (T_s - T_0) * sqrt( (k * t) / (ρ * L) ) / (n * something) )

Wait, perhaps I should look for the Stefan solution for a semi-infinite solid. The Stefan number (Ste) is involved, which is (c_p (T_s - T_m)) / (L), where c_p is the specific heat capacity.

Wait, the general approach for the Stefan problem for freezing is:

The depth of the freezing front, d, is given by:

d = (2 * α * Ste * t)^(1/2)

Where Ste is the Stefan number, defined as:

Ste = (c_p * (T_s - T_m)) / L

But wait, in this case, T_s would be the surface temperature, which is lower than the initial temperature T_initial (which is higher than T_m, the melting point).

Wait, I think the correct Stefan number here is Ste = (c_p (T_initial - T_m)) / L, because T_initial is the initial temperature of the solid, and T_s is the temperature at the surface. Oh wait, no, because in this case, the surface is cooled below the melting point, so T_s < T_m.

Wait, Stefan's problem usually deals with a solid initially at a uniform temperature T_initial = T_m, and the surface is suddenly cooled to T_s < T_m. But in our case, the initial ground temperature is higher than T_m, which is 0°C. So the formula might adjust accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps the temperature difference in the Stefan number is (T_initial - T_s). Let me check that.

Yes, I think the Stefan number is defined as:

Ste = (c_p (T_initial - T_s)) / L

Because T_initial is higher than T_s, so it's positive.

Therefore, the depth d is:

d = 2 * α * Ste * t

But wait, no, because in Stefan's solution, the depth is proportional to the square root of time. So the formula is:

d = (2 * α * Ste) * sqrt(t)

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the solution is:

d = (2 * sqrt( α * t )) * ( Ste ) / ( (Ste + 1)^(1/2) ) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for the formula for frost penetration depth.

Alternatively, I remember a simplified formula for estimating frost penetration depth, which is:

d = sqrt( (k * t * (T_s - T_initial)) / (ρ * L) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula is:

d = sqrt( (2 * k * t * (T_s - T_initial)) / (ρ * L) )

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = sqrt( (2 * α * t * (T_s - T_initial)) )

But I'm not confident. Maybe I should look up the formula, but since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed with what I think is correct.

Wait, let's think about the variables involved:

- Thermal diffusivity α for soil: I think it's around 0.1 m²/day, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's 0.05 m²/day for some soils.

- Latent heat of fusion for water, L: approximately 334,000 J/kg.

- Density ρ of soil: maybe around 1500 kg/m³.

- Time t: 60 hours. Let's convert that into days because thermal diffusivity might be in per day units. 60 hours is 2.5 days.

- Temperature difference: The ground's initial temperature is 7°C, and the air temperature drops to -8°C. So the surface of the ground will be at -8°C, but the initial temperature is 7°C. So the temperature difference is T_initial - T_s = 7 - (-8) = 15°C, which is 15 K.

Wait, but in the Stefan problem, the formula accounts for the solid's initial temperature being above the melting point, and the surface being cooled below it. So the correct formula should involve the Stefan number, which includes this temperature difference.

So let me try to reconstruct the Stefan solution. The depth d is given by:

d = (2 * sqrt( α * t )) * [ Ste / (Ste + 1) ) ]^(1/2) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, I've read that for small Stefan numbers, the depth can be approximated as:

d ≈ sqrt( (2 * α * t * Ste) )

Where Ste is the Stefan number.

So let's compute the Stefan number first. Ste = (c_p * (T_initial - T_s)) / L

Wait, but what is c_p (specific heat at constant pressure) for soil? I'm not sure, but perhaps for wet soil, it's around 1.5e3 J/kg·K or something like that. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with water. Water's specific heat is 4.18e3 J/kg·K, but soil's would be lower, maybe around 800 J/kg·K.

Wait, but perhaps for this problem, the thermal properties are considered as average, and maybe the formula is simplified.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for frost penetration depth is given by:

d = (T_s - T_initial) * sqrt( (k * t) / (ρ * L) )

But I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should look for a more straightforward approach.

Wait, another approach: the depth of frost penetration can be calculated using the formula:

d = 0.0132 * sqrt( (t * (T_s - T_initial)) )

But I don't think that's correct. Alternatively, I've heard of the formula d = 0.0132 * sqrt( t * (T_s - T_initial) ), but I'm not sure of the units here.

Wait, perhaps I should convert all units to SI units to make it easier.

So let's list out the known variables:

- T_initial = 7°C = 280.15 K (since 0°C is 273.15 K)
- T_s = -8°C = 265.15 K
- Time t = 60 hours = 60 * 3600 = 216,000 seconds
- Let's assume the thermal diffusivity α for soil. I think for moist soil, α is about 0.05 m²/day. Let me convert that to m²/s. Since 1 day is 86400 seconds, α = 0.05 / 86400 ≈ 5.787e-7 m²/s.
- Latent heat of fusion for water, L = 334,000 J/kg
- Density ρ of soil: let's assume 1500 kg/m³

Now, using Stefan's solution, the depth d is given by:

d = (2 * α * Ste * t)^(1/2)

Where Ste is the Stefan number, Ste = (c_p * (T_initial - T_s)) / L

Wait, but I don't have c_p for the soil. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way around it, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to use the formula for the penetration depth in the absence of phase change first. The thermal penetration depth is given by sqrt(α * t). But with phase change (freezing), it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = ( (T_initial - T_s) * sqrt( (k * t) / (ρ * L) ) )

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:

d = ( (T_initial - T_s) * sqrt( (α * t) / (L * ρ) ) )

Wait, let's try plugging in the numbers with some assumed constants and see which option matches.

Assuming:

d = sqrt( (2 * α * t * (T_initial - T_s)) / (ρ * L) )

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

Compute (T_initial - T_s) in Kelvin: 280.15 - 265.15 = 15 K.

α: 5.787e-7 m²/s (from 0.05 m²/day)
t: 216,000 s
ρ: 1500 kg/m³
L: 334,000 J/kg

So compute numerator: 2 * α * t * (T_initial - T_s)
= 2 * 5.787e-7 * 216000 * 15
Let me calculate this:

First, 2 * 5.787e-7 = 1.1574e-6
Multiply by 216000: 1.1574e-6 * 2.16e5 = (1.1574 * 2.16) * 1e-1 = approx 2.500 * 0.1 = 0.25
Then multiply by 15: 0.25 * 15 = 3.75

Denominator: ρ * L = 1500 * 334000 = 4.5e8 J/m³

So overall, d² = 3.75 / 4.5e8 = 8.333e-9 m²
Then d = sqrt(8.333e-9) ≈ 9.13e-5 m, which is 0.0913 cm. That doesn't make sense because the options are in tens of cm.

Hmm, clearly I must have done something wrong, because the result I got is way too small.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me try a different approach.

Alternative formula: d = (T_initial - T_s) * sqrt( (α * t) / (L * ρ) )

Let me compute that:

(T_initial - T_s) = 15 K
sqrt( (α * t) / (L * ρ) )

Compute inside the sqrt:

α = 5.787e-7 m²/s
t = 216000 s
L = 334000 J/kg
ρ = 1500 kg/m³

So numerator: α * t = 5.787e-7 * 216000 ≈ 0.125 m²
Denominator: L * ρ = 334000 * 1500 = 5.01e8 J/m³
So (α * t) / (L * ρ) = 0.125 / 5.01e8 ≈ 2.496e-10
sqrt of that is approx 1.579e-5

So d = 15 * 1.579e-5 = 2.368e-4 m, which is 0.2368 cm. Still way too small.

This can't be right because the options are around 20-35 cm. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should revisit the Stefan problem. The solution for the one-dimensional Stefan problem with a flat interface is given by:

d = (2 * Ste * sqrt(α * t)) / (1 + Ste) )

Where Ste is the Stefan number, defined as:

Ste = (c_p * (T_initial - T_s)) / L

But again, I'm missing c_p for the soil. Let's assume c_p for soil is around 800 J/kg·K.

So Ste = (800 J/kg·K * 15 K) / 334000 J/kg
= (12000) / 334000 ≈ 0.03595

Now, sqrt(α * t) = sqrt(5.787e-7 m²/s * 216000 s) = sqrt(0.125) = 0.3536 m

So d = (2 * 0.03595 * 0.3536) / (1 + 0.03595) )

Compute numerator: 2 * 0.03595 ≈ 0.0719; 0.0719 * 0.3536 ≈ 0.02543 m

Denominator: 1.03595 ≈ 1.036

So d ≈ 0.02543 / 1.036 ≈ 0.02456 m, which is 2.456 cm. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that I'm using the wrong thermal diffusivity. Maybe α for soil is higher than 0.05 m²/day. Let's check: some sources say that the thermal diffusivity of soil varies, but let's say for moist clay, α is about 0.05 m²/day, but maybe for other soils it's higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion of α from m²/day to m²/s. Let me recheck.

If α = 0.05 m²/day, then in m²/s, it's 0.05 / (24 * 3600) = 0.05 / 86400 ≈ 5.787e-7 m²/s. That seems correct.

But maybe the
