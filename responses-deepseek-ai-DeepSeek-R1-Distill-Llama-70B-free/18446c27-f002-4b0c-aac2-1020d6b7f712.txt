Question:

Briefly describe motor development in the adolescent.

Options:

A: Adolescent's motor development is marked by a decrease in the length of limbs and slower motor performance.
B: Adolescent's motor development sees a reduction in rapid growth, a decrease in physical strength, and an increase in reaction time.
C: Adolescent's motor development includes a plateau in physical strength, no significant growth, and unchanging reaction times.
D: Adolescent's motor development leads to a decline in coordination and motor skills due to rapid limb growth.
E: Adolescent's motor development is characterized by a rapid increase in physical activity but no significant changes in strength or motor performance.
F: Adolescent's motor development is characterized by decreased physical strength and slower reaction time.
G: Adolescent's motor development involves a decrease in physical activity and longer reaction time.
H: Adolescent's motor development is defined by minimal changes in physical strength and limb length, with no improvement in motor performance.
I: Adolescent's motor development is marked by a steady decline in both growth and physical activity levels.
J: Adolescent's motor development is characterized by increased physical strength, rapid growth, increased length of limbs, accelerated speed of motor performance, and shorter reaction time.

Okay, so I've got this question about motor development in adolescents, and I need to pick the correct answer from options A to J. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that adolescence is the period between puberty and adulthood. During this time, the body undergoes significant changes due to puberty. So motor development would involve growth spurts and changes in physical capabilities.

I think during puberty, especially in early adolescence, there's a rapid growth spurt. This means limbs, like arms and legs, grow longer. So any option suggesting a decrease in limb length is probably wrong. Looking at the options, A says a decrease in limb length, which doesn't make sense. Similarly, options like B and F mention decreases in strength or slower performance, which I don't think is right because strength usually increases.

Wait, but I also recall that during puberty, the growth spurts can sometimes cause a bit of clumsiness as the body adjusts. So maybe coordination might temporarily decline? But that's probably more in early stages, and overall, motor skills improve as the teen's nervous system matures.

So motor performance should improve. Reaction time—oh right, reaction times actually get faster during adolescence. So any option that says reaction time increases would be incorrect because faster reaction times mean shorter durations, so reaction times decrease.

Looking at the options again. Option J says increased physical strength, rapid growth, increased limb length, accelerated motor performance, and shorter reaction time. That sounds about right. Adolescents do get stronger, they grow taller, and their motor skills improve, including speed and reaction times.

Wait, what about the other options. Let's check them quickly. Option D says decline in coordination due to rapid limb growth. That might happen initially, but overall, motor skills improve, so D might not be correct. Option E talks about increased activity but no changes in strength or performance—that's not right because strength does increase.

Option J seems to cover all the positives: strength up, growth, longer limbs, faster motor skills, and shorter reaction times. Yeah, that makes sense. So I think the correct answer is J.

The correct answer is J. Adolescent motor development is characterized by increased physical strength, rapid growth, increased limb length, accelerated motor performance, and shorter reaction times.

Answer: J
