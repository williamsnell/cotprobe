Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a collision between two particles. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the problem says a particle of mass m is moving with velocity u1 and collides head-on with another particle of mass 2m that's at rest. I need to find the velocity v1 of the first particle after the collision, given that the coefficient of restitution is such that the loss of kinetic energy is maximum. Hmm, okay.

Wait, I remember that in collisions, the coefficient of restitution (e) determines how much kinetic energy is lost. The maximum loss of kinetic energy would mean that e is as small as possible, right? Because e=1 is a perfectly elastic collision with no kinetic energy loss, and e=0 is a perfectly inelastic collision where the maximum energy is lost as they stick together. So to maximize the loss, e should be zero. So this is a perfectly inelastic collision.

Wait no, wait. Wait, no, the problem says the coefficient of restitution is such to make the loss of kinetic energy a maximum. So that would imply that e is zero because that's when the kinetic energy loss is maximum. Because in a perfectly inelastic collision, the two masses stick together and move with the same velocity. That makes sense because that scenario leads to the maximum possible energy loss as they don't bounce back.

So if e=0, then it's a perfectly inelastic collision. So I can use the equations for that.

But wait, another thought: when e=0, the relative velocity after collision is zero. So the velocities of both objects become the same. So let's apply conservation of momentum here.

The initial momentum before collision is just the momentum of the first particle, since the second is at rest. So initial momentum P_initial = m * u1 + 2m * 0 = m u1.

After collision, both masses move together with velocity v. So the total mass is m + 2m = 3m. So momentum after collision is 3m * v.

Conservation of momentum says P_initial = P_final, so m u1 = 3m v. Solving for v, the velocity after collision, we have v = (m u1) / (3m) )= u1/3.

But wait, since both masses stick together, both will have velocity u1/3. So the velocity of the first particle, v1, is u1/3.

Looking at the options, option B is (1/3) u1, which would be the velocity of the first particle. But wait, option B is (1/3)u1. So that's the answer?

Wait, but let me think again. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So when e=0, maximum kinetic energy loss. So the collision is perfectly inelastic, they stick together and move with same velocity.

So yes, the velocity of each is u1/3. So v1, the velocity of the first particle, is u1/3. So the correct answer is B.

But wait another thing: in an inelastic collision, the kinetic energy is not conserved. Let me compute the initial and final kinetic energy just to check.

Initial KE: (1/2) m u1² + 0 = (1/2) m u1².

Final KE: (1/2)(3m) (u1/3)² = (1/2)(3m)(u1²/9) )= (1/2)(m u1² / 3 )= (1/6) m u1².

So the change in KE is initial minus final: (1/2 - 1/6) m u1² = (1/3) m u1². That's a significant loss, so it makes sense as maximum loss.

Wait, but what if the problem isn't about e being zero? Wait, the question states that the coefficient of restitution is such to make the loss maximum. So yes, e=0 gives maximum loss. So the answer should be option B.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this problem using the general equations involving the coefficient of restitution. Let me try that.

The coefficient of restitution e is given by e = (v2 - v1)/(u1 - u2), where u1 is initial velocity of first object, u2 of second. But wait, wait, the correct formula is e = (velocity of approach before collision) / (velocity of separation after collision). So the approach velocity is u1 - u2. After collision, the separation velocity is v1 - v2. So e = (v1 - v2)/(u1 - u2). But wait, wait, I might have that backwards. It's actually the relative velocity after divided by the relative velocity before, but with a negative sign because approach becomes separation. So e = -(v2 - v1)/(u1 - u2). Hmm, perhaps I should clarify.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is e = (v2' - v1')/(u1 - u2), where primes denote after collision. Because u2 is zero here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write down the equations for an elastic collision and then see how e affects it.

In a general, non-elastic collision, the two equations are:

1. Conservation of momentum: m u1 + 2m * 0 = m v1 + 2m v2.

So equation 1: m u1 = m v1 + 2m v2.

Dividing both sides by m: u1 = v1 + 2 v2. -- (1)

The second equation comes from the coefficient of restitution: e = (v2 - v1)/(u1 - 0) because u2 is zero. So e = (v2 - v1)/u1. -- (2)

We can solve equations (1) and (2) together to find v1 and v2 in terms of e.

From equation (1): v1 = u1 - 2 v2.

Substituting into equation (2):

e = (v2 - (u1 - 2 v2)) / u1.

Simplify numerator: v2 - u1 + 2 v2 = 3 v2 - u1.

So e = (3 v2 - u1)/u1.

Multiply both sides by u1: e u1 = 3 v2 - u1.

Bring u1 to the other side: 3 v2 = u1 (1 + e).

So v2 = [u1 (1 + e)] /3.

Now substitute v2 into equation (1):

v1 = u1 - 2 * [u1 (1 + e)/3 ].

Factor u1: v1 = u1 [ 1 - 2(1 + e)/3 ].

Simplify inside the brackets: 1 is 3/3, so 3/3 - 2(1+e)/3 = [3 - 2(1+e)] /3.

Compute numerator: 3 - 2 - 2e = (1 - 2e).

So v1 = u1 (1 - 2e)/3.

Hmm, okay. Now, the kinetic energy after collision is KE_final = (1/2)m v1² + (1/2)(2m) v2².

The loss of kinetic energy is KE_initial - KE_final.

KE_initial is (1/2) m u1².

So, KE_loss = (1/2 m u1²) - [ (1/2 m v1²) + (1/2 * 2m) v2² ) ].

Simplify: KE_loss = (1/2 m u1^2) - [ (1/2 m v1²) + m v2² ) ].

We can express everything in terms of e.

But since we want to maximize the loss of kinetic energy, we need to find e that minimizes KE_final. Because loss is initial minus final, so lower final KE means higher loss.

Wait, but the problem states that the coefficient of restitution is such that loss is maximum. So which e gives the maximum loss?

KE_final is a function of e. Let me express KE_final in terms of e.

We have v1 = u1 (1-2e)/3.

v2 = u1 (1 + e)/3.

So,

KE_final = (1/2)m [ (u1^2 (1-2e)^2 ) /9 ] + (1/2)(2m) [ (u1^2 (1+e)^2 ) /9 ].

Simplify each term:

First term: (1/2 m)(u1² (1-4e +4e² )) /9 = (m u1² (1-4e +4e² )) / 18.

Second term: (1/2 *2m) (u1² (1 + 2e + e² )) /9 = (m u1² (1 + 2e + e² )) /9.

So adding both terms:

KE_final = [m u1² (1-4e +4e² ) ] /18 + [m u1² (1 + 2e + e² ) ] /9.

Factor m u1²:

KE_final = m u1² [ (1-4e +4e²)/18 + (1 + 2e + e²)/9 ].

Let's get a common denominator of 18:

= m u1² [ (1-4e+4e²) + 2(1 + 2e + e²) ) ] / 18.

Expand the numerator:

1 -4e +4e² + 2 +4e + 2e².

Combine like terms:

1+2 =3; -4e +4e=0; 4e² +2e²=6e².

So numerator is 3 + 6e².

Thus, KE_final = m u1² (3 +6e² ) /18.

Simplify numerator: 3(1 + 2e² ) /18 = (1 + 2e² ) /6.

So KE_final = (m u1² (1 + 2 e² )) /6.

So the KE after collision is proportional to (1 + 2 e²). To minimize KE_final (maximizing loss), we need to minimize (1 + 2 e²). The minimum of this is when e is as small as possible.

The coefficient of restitution e can range from 0 to 1. So the smallest possible e is 0. So setting e=0 gives the maximum loss.

So when e=0, v1 = u1 (1 - 0 ) /3 = u1/3, as before.

Which is option B.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Another approach: the maximum kinetic energy loss occurs when the relative velocity after collision is maximum. Wait, no, when e is zero, the relative velocity is zero. So that's when the kinetic energy loss is maximum.

Alternatively, sometimes I've heard that maximum kinetic energy loss in a collision occurs when the two objects stick together, which is the perfectly inelastic case, e=0.

So that's consistent with our earlier conclusion. Therefore, the velocity v1 is u1/3, which is option B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision using the principles of momentum conservation and the coefficient of restitution. The goal is to determine the velocity \( v_1 \) of the first particle after the collision, given that the coefficient of restitution is such that the loss of kinetic energy is maximized.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Maximum Kinetic Energy Loss**: The loss of kinetic energy is maximized when the coefficient of restitution \( e = 0 \), which corresponds to a perfectly inelastic collision. In this case, the two particles stick together and move with the same velocity after the collision.

2. **Conservation of Momentum**: The total momentum before and after the collision must be conserved. Initially, the momentum is entirely due to the first particle:
   \[
   P_{\text{initial}} = m u_1
   \]
   After the collision, the two particles (total mass \( m + 2m = 3m \)) move together with a common velocity \( v \). Thus, the momentum after the collision is:
   \[
   P_{\text{final}} = 3m v
   \]
   Equating initial and final momentum:
   \[
   m u_1 = 3m v
   \]
   Solving for \( v \):
   \[
   v = \frac{u_1}{3}
   \]

3. **Velocity of the First Particle**: Since the particles stick together in a perfectly inelastic collision, the velocity of the first particle after the collision is the same as the common velocity \( v \). Therefore:
   \[
   v_1 = \frac{u_1}{3}
   \]

4. **Verification of Kinetic Energy Loss**: The initial kinetic energy is:
   \[
   KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} m u_1^2
   \]
   The final kinetic energy is:
   \[
   KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} (3m) \left(\frac{u_1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{6} m u_1^2
   \]
   The loss of kinetic energy is:
   \[
   \Delta KE = KE_{\text{initial}} - KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} m u_1^2 - \frac{1}{6} m u_1^2 = \frac{1}{3} m u_1^2
   \]
   This confirms that the kinetic energy loss is maximized when \( e = 0 \).

### Conclusion:
The velocity of the first particle after the collision is \( v_1 = \frac{u_1}{3} \). This corresponds to **option B**.
