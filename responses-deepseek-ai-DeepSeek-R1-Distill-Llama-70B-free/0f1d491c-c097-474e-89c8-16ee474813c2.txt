Question:

With capital fixed at one unit with 1, 2, 3 units of labor added in equal successive units, production of the output increases from 300 (1 unit of labor), to 350 (2 units of labor) to 375 (3 units of labor). Which of the following is a correct interpretation?

Options:

A: This is long run constant returns to scale.
B: This is short run decreasing returns to scale.
C: This is long run increasing returns to scale.
D: This is long run decreasing returns to scale.
E: This is short run increasing returns to scale.
F: This is long run diminishing marginal productivity.
G: This is the effect of labor saturation.
H: This is due to labor specialization efficiency.
I: This is short run diminishing marginal productivity.
J: This is short run constant returns to scale.

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that the capital is fixed at one unit, and labor is added in equal successive unitsâ€”so 1, 2, 3 units. The output starts at 300 with 1 unit of labor, then goes to 350 with 2 units, and 375 with 3 units. I need to choose the correct interpretation from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that in production, when you add more units of a variable input (like labor) while keeping capital fixed, you're probably looking at the short run. Because in the long run, all inputs can be varied. So this must be a short-run scenario.

Now, looking at the output changes. From 1 to 2 units of labor, output increases by 50 (from 300 to 350). Then from 2 to 3 units, it increases by 25 (350 to 375). So each additional unit of labor is adding less to output. That sounds like diminishing marginal returns, right?

Wait, what's the difference between diminishing returns and decreasing returns to scale? Oh right, returns to scale are about how output changes when all inputs are scaled up. Diminishing returns happen when you add more of one input (like labor) while keeping others (capital) fixed. So this is about marginal productivity, not returns to scale.

So the question is showing that each additional labor unit adds less output, which is diminishing marginal productivity in the short run. So I'm thinking it's about short-run diminishing marginal productivity.

Looking at the options:

Option I: This is short run diminishing marginal productivity. That seems to fit.

Wait, let me double-check the other options to be sure. Option E is short run increasing returns, but the output increases are getting smaller, not larger. So E is out. Option B is short run decreasing returns to scale, but that's about scaling all inputs, which isn't the case here. Option G is labor saturation, which I think is similar to diminishing returns. But I'm not sure what exactly 'labor saturation' means. Maybe it's when adding more labor doesn't help because there's too much already. But in this case, output is still increasing, just by smaller increments, so maybe G isn't the right term here.

Option I seems more accurate because it describes the situation where each additional unit of labor (marginal) leads to a smaller increase in output, which is the definition of diminishing marginal productivity. So the correct answer should be I.

The scenario describes a situation where capital is fixed, and labor is added in successive units, leading to increasing output but at a decreasing rate. This is characteristic of the short run, as only labor is being varied while capital remains constant. The output increases by 50 units when the first unit of labor is added, 50 units with the second, and 25 units with the third. The diminishing increments in output indicate that each additional unit of labor contributes less to production, which is a classic case of diminishing marginal productivity.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I** correctly identifies this as "short run diminishing marginal productivity," which aligns with the observed pattern of decreasing output increments as more labor is added.
- Other options, such as **E (short run increasing returns)**, are incorrect because the output increases are not accelerating. Similarly, **B (short run decreasing returns to scale)** and **D (long run decreasing returns to scale)** are irrelevant because returns to scale involve scaling all inputs, not just labor. **G (labor saturation)** is not the best fit, as output is still increasing, even if by smaller increments.

Thus, the correct interpretation is **short run diminishing marginal productivity**.

Answer: I
