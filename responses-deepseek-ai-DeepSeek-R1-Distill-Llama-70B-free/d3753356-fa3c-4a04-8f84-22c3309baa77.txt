The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Your new â€˜client is a 37-year-old woman whose symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. After your third session with her, she tells you that she was in treatment with another psychologist but terminated after the psychologist made sexual advances toward her. She does not want you to discuss this matter with anyone. To be consistent with the provisions of the ethics codes of the American and Canadian Psychology Association, your best course of action would be to:

A: Refuse to continue therapy until she allows you to report the unethical behavior.
B: Inform the client of the limits of confidentiality and insist on reporting the unethical behavior.
C: discuss the client's options with her and maintain her confidentiality unless she signs a release.
D: contact the Ethics Committee to determine what the appropriate steps would be in this situation.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about ethics in psychology, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it again carefully.

The client is a 37-year-old woman with Major Depressive Disorder. She's been in treatment before but stopped because her previous psychologist made sexual advances towards her. Now, she tells the current therapist about this and says she doesn't want it discussed with anyone. The question is about what the therapist should do according to the ethics codes of the American and Canadian Psychology Associations.

Hmm, I remember that confidentiality is a big part of ethical guidelines. Therapists have a duty to maintain confidentiality, but there are exceptions, like when there's a risk of harm to the client or others. In this case, the client is revealing unethical behavior by another psychologist, but she doesn't want it reported.

So what are the options? Let me go through each choice.

Option A: Refuse to continue therapy until she allows reporting. That seems a bit harsh. I don't think forcing her is the right approach. It could harm the therapeutic relationship.

Option B: Inform her about limits of confidentiality and insist on reporting. I'm not sure if the therapist must report this. The limits usually involve situations where there's imminent danger, not past misconduct unless it's ongoing.

Option C: Discuss her options and maintain confidentiality unless she signs a release. This sounds reasonable. The therapist should talk with her about what she can do, like reporting to the licensing board, but respect her confidentiality unless she agrees.

Option D: Contact the Ethics Committee. Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the first step. The therapist might need to consult, but the question is about the best course of action with the client.

Option E: Contact the police. Unless the advances were illegal, like sexual assault, maybe, but the question doesn't specify that. It might be more of a licensing issue than criminal.

Option F: Discuss with supervisor. That's a good idea, but the question is about what to do with the client, not internal steps.

Option G: Inform about confidentiality limits and contact the other psychologist. That could be problematic. The other psychologist might not take it well, and it could compromise the client's wishes.

Option H: Inform about limits and report the behavior. Again, the client doesn't want it reported, so the therapist can't do that unless there's a legal obligation.

Option I: Stop therapy due to conflict. I don't see a conflict here, so that might not be necessary.

Option J: Continue without addressing. That doesn't seem right because the issue is important and could affect therapy.

Wait, the main point is the client's confidentiality. The therapist can't breach that unless there's a duty to report. But in this case, the unethical behavior is in the past, not an immediate danger. So the therapist should probably respect her confidentiality but discuss her options.

So the best action would be to discuss the client's options with her, maintain confidentiality unless she consents to releasing information. That would be option C. The therapist can explain that they can't go against her wishes unless there's a legal requirement, which doesn't seem to apply here.

I think option C is the correct answer because it respects the client's autonomy and confidentiality while providing support and options.

The best course of action is to discuss the client's options with her and maintain her confidentiality unless she signs a release. This approach respects her autonomy while providing support and adhering to ethical guidelines.

Answer: C
