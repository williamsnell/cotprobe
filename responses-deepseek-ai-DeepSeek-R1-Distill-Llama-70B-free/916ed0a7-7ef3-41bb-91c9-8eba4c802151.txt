C: $3.00
D: 3.2
E: $4.00
F: $3.20

Okay, so I've got this question about earnings per share, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully again.

Toft Co. had 120,000 shares of common stock outstanding at January 1. On April 1, they issued 40,000 more shares. So the common stock increases during the year. Also, there are 10,000 shares of nonconvertible preferred stock outstanding all year. The preferred stock has a dividend of $5 per share declared during the year. Net income is $480,000. We need to find the earnings per share (EPS) for the year.

Hmm, I remember that EPS is calculated by dividing the net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. So first, I think I need to adjust the net income for the preferred dividends because preferred shareholders get their dividends before anything is left for common stockholders.

Right, the formula is: EPS = (Net Income - Preferred Dividends) / Weighted Average Common Shares.

So let's compute the preferred dividends first. There are 10,000 shares of preferred stock, each paying $5. So that's 10,000 * $5 = $50,000 in preferred dividends.

Net income is $480,000. Subtracting preferred dividends gives us the income available for common stockholders: 480,000 - 50,000 = $430,000.

Now, the next part is figuring out the weighted average of common shares outstanding. The company started with 120,000 shares on Jan 1, and on April 1, they issued 40,000 more. So I need to calculate how many months each of these shares were outstanding.

Wait, the year is presumably a calendar year, so 12 months. The 120,000 shares were there for the full year, right? Because they were outstanding at the beginning. Then on April 1, which is the start of the 4th month, they issued more. So from April to December is 9 months.

But wait, when you issue shares during the year, you have to weight them by the fraction of the year they were outstanding. So 120,000 shares were there for all 12 months, and 40,000 were there for 9 months.

Wait, but another way to think about it is that the 40,000 shares were added on April 1, so they were present for 9 months out of 12. So the weighting would be 9/12, which is 3/4, or 0.75.

Wait, but wait another thought: the formula for weighted average when new shares are issued is (number of shares) multiplied by the fraction of the year they were outstanding. So the initial 120,000 shares were there for the entire year, so 120,000 * 12/12 = 120,000. The new shares are 40,000 * 9/12, which is 30,000. So the total weighted average is 120,000 + 30,000 = 150,000 shares.

Wait, but let me double-check that. So the 40,000 shares were issued on April 1, so they were outstanding for 9 months (April to December inclusive). So each month is 1/12 of the year. So 9 months is 9/12 = 3/4 of the year. So 40,000 * (9/12) = 30,000. So yes, adding that to the original 120,000 gives 150,000.

So the denominator in the EPS calculation is 150,000.

Then, the numerator is $430,000 (net income minus preferred dividends). So EPS is 430,000 divided by 150,000.

Let me compute that: 430,000 / 150,000 = 2.866... Approximately $2.87.

Looking at the options, option H is $2.87. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm the steps again. Did I handle the preferred dividends correctly? Yes, because preferred dividends are subtracted from net income to get the amount available to common stockholders. Then the denominator is the weighted average of common shares, considering when the new shares were issued.

Yep, that makes sense. So the calculation should be correct.

To calculate the earnings per share (EPS) for Toft Co., we follow these steps:

1. **Subtract Preferred Dividends from Net Income**:  
   - Net income for the year is $480,000.  
   - Preferred dividends are calculated as $5 per share on 10,000 shares:  
     \[
     10,000 \times \$5 = \$50,000
     \]  
   - Net income available to common shareholders:  
     \[
     \$480,000 - \$50,000 = \$430,000
     \]

2. **Calculate the Weighted Average of Common Shares Outstanding**:  
   - 120,000 shares were outstanding for the entire year (12 months).  
   - 40,000 shares were issued on April 1 and were outstanding for 9 months (April to December).  
   - Weighted average of common shares:  
     \[
     (120,000 \times \frac{12}{12}) + (40,000 \times \frac{9}{12}) = 120,000 + 30,000 = 150,000
     \]

3. **Compute Earnings Per Share (EPS)**:  
   - EPS is calculated as:  
     \[
     \text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income Available to Common Shareholders}}{\text{Weighted Average Common Shares Outstanding}}
     \]  
     Substituting the values:  
     \[
     \text{EPS} = \frac{\$430,000}{150,000} = \$2.87
     \]

Thus, the earnings per share for the year is **$2.87**, which corresponds to option **H**.
