Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory, specifically about homomorphic images and factor groups. Hmm, I need to evaluate two statements and determine if they're true or false. Let me think back to what I learned in my algebra class.

First, let's try to understand the terms involved. A homomorphic image of a group G is basically the image of a homomorphism from G to another group. So if φ: G → H is a group homomorphism, then the image φ(G) is a subgroup of H. Now, the question is relating this to factor groups, which are also called quotient groups. A factor group is formed by partitioning a group into cosets of a normal subgroup, right? So if N is a normal subgroup of G, then G/N is the factor group.

Statement 1 says that every homomorphic image of G is isomorphic to a factor group of G. Okay, I remember the First Isomorphism Theorem. It states that if φ: G → H is a homomorphism with kernel K, then φ(G), which is the image, is isomorphic to G/K. So the image is indeed a factor group of G. That makes Statement 1 true because any homomorphic image can be expressed as G modulo the kernel of the homomorphism.

Now, Statement 2 claims that the homomorphic images of G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G. Let me think. From the First Isomorphism Theorem, every homomorphic image is isomorphic to a factor group G/K for some normal subgroup K. But are all factor groups also homomorphic images? Well, yes, because for any factor group G/N, the natural projection π: G → G/N is a surjective homomorphism, so G/N is the image of π. So every factor group is a homomorphic image, and vice versa. That would mean that the homomorphic images and the factor groups are in a one-to-one correspondence in terms of isomorphism classes. So Statement 2 must also be true.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. If every homomorphic image is a factor group, and every factor group is a homomorphic image, then they are essentially the same in terms of isomorphism types. So Statement 2 is correct because they are the same up to isomorphism.

Wait, but I'm trying to think if there's any exception. Like, maybe some factor groups can't be images or vice versa. But no, I think the first isomorphism theorem covers that. So both statements are true.

Looking back at the options, option F says the statements are equivalent and both are true. Option A also says both are true. But wait, are the statements equivalent? Statement 1 is that every image is a factor group, and Statement 2 is that images and factor groups are the same up to isomorphism. They're two sides of the same coin. So yes, they're equivalent, and both are true. So the correct option is F.

Wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake. Option A says both are true, and option F says they are equivalent and both are true. Wait, the question is phrased as two separate statements. Are they equivalent or just both true?

I think they are equivalent because if every image is a factor group, and every factor group is an image, then they are the same. So the statements are equivalent, and both are true. So option F is correct.

Wait, but the original options: A is True, True. F says the statements are equivalent and both are true. So I think F is the correct answer.

Statement 1 asserts that every homomorphic image of a group \( G \) is isomorphic to a factor group of \( G \). This is supported by the First Isomorphism Theorem, which states that if \( \phi: G \to H \) is a homomorphism with kernel \( K \), then \( \phi(G) \) is isomorphic to \( G/K \). Thus, every homomorphic image corresponds to a factor group, making Statement 1 true.

Statement 2 claims that the homomorphic images of \( G \) are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of \( G \). This is also true because, by the First Isomorphism Theorem, every factor group \( G/N \) (where \( N \) is a normal subgroup) is the image of a surjective homomorphism (e.g., the natural projection \( \pi: G \to G/N \)). Conversely, every homomorphic image is isomorphic to some factor group. Therefore, the homomorphic images and factor groups are in one-to-one correspondence up to isomorphism.

Since both statements are true and they are equivalent (each implies the other), the correct answer is that the statements are equivalent and both are true.

Answer: F
