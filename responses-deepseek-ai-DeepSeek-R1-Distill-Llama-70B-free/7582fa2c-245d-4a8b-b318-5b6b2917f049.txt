Okay, so I have this question about group tasks, and I need to figure out the correct term. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about a specific type of task where group members select a solution offered by one of the members as the group's solution. So, I need to remember the different types of group tasks and what each entails.

I remember from my psychology class that there are different classifications of group tasks based on how the group's output is determined. One of the main distinctions is between additive, disjunctive, conjunctive, and integrative tasks, among others.

Let me try to recall each type:

- Additive tasks: These are tasks where the group's performance is the sum of individual contributions. Like if each person does a part and you add them up. For example, if everyone in the group contributes ideas and the total is the sum, that's additive.

- Disjunctive tasks: These rely on the group succeeding if at least one member succeeds. Think of it like the group is trying to solve a problem, and if even one person figures it out, the group as a whole succeeds. So the group's solution is the best individual solution.

Wait, that sounds similar to what the question is asking. Because in a disjunctive task, the group's solution might just be the correct answer from one member, and the others don't necessarily have to contribute to that solution beyond trying individually.

- Conjunctive tasks: These require all group members to succeed for the group to succeed. Like if the group is lifting a heavy object together; everyone needs to do their part. So the group's performance is as strong as the weakest link.

- Integrative tasks: These require the group to combine different ideas or expertise to create a solution. It's more collaborative, where each member's input is necessary to form the final product. Like solving a complex problem that needs different perspectives.

The question is about selecting a solution offered by one member as the group's. So in that case, the group isn't combining their ideas but instead choosing one person's idea. That sounds like a disjunctive task because the group's success depends on at least one member's solution. The group selects the solution, perhaps the best one from the options presented by members.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between disjunctive and additive. Let me think again. In additive tasks, each member's contribution adds up, but the group's solution isn't just one member's idea. It's more about combining efforts. Disjunctive is where one member's solution is sufficient. So if the group picks someone's solution and that's the final answer, that's disjunctive.

So the correct term for the blank would be disjunctive. Looking at the options, option D is disjunctive.

The question asks for the type of task where group members select a solution offered by one member as the group's solution. This scenario aligns with a **disjunctive task**, where the group's success depends on at least one member providing a correct solution, and the group adopts that solution as their own.

Answer: D
