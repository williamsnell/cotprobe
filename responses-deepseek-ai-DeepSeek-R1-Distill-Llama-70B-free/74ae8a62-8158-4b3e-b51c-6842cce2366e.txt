Question:

Osgood is the record owner of Desertacre, a 100- acre tract of farmland in California's Coachella Valley. Osgood inherited the property from his father and farmed the land until 2006, when he reached the age of 70. He then decided to retire and move to Scottsdale, Arizona. At that time, Osgood conveyed Desertacre to Cutler "for his use during his natural life. "After taking possession of the property, Cutler executed a mortgage on Desertacre in the amount of $100,000. In 2009, Osgood died and in his will, the testator devised Desertacre to his son, Desmond, with remainder to Deirdre. The will provided that Desmond and Deirdre took Desertacre "subject to Cutler's mortgage. "At the time of Osgood's death, Desertacre had a market value of $300,000. When Desmond learned of the devise, he was hesitant about taking title to Desertacre because he did not want to incur any indebtedness. Assume that Culter is still alive and in possession of the tract. With respect to the mortgage, Desmond will be

Options:

A: liable for the mortgage, because he is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will.
B: liable for the mortgage, because the property was devised subject to the mortgage.
C: not liable, because there was no assumption of the mortgage.
D: not liable, because he did not personally grant the mortgage.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, Osgood owns Desertacre, a 100-acre farm. He inherited it from his father and farmed it until he was 70, then decided to retire and move to Arizona. At that point, he conveyed Desertacre to Cutler "for his use during his natural life." Hmm, okay, that sounds like a life estate. So Cutler has a life estate, and Osgood probably kept the remainder interest, right?

Then, Cutler took a mortgage on the property for $100,000. Mortgages are usually loans secured by the property. So the mortgage is on Desertacre. Now, in 2009, Osgood dies. His will devises Desertacre to his son Desmond, with a remainder to Deirdre. The will says they take it "subject to Cutler's mortgage." So Desmond gets it first, then Deirdre, but both are subject to the mortgage.

At the time of Osgood's death, the property's value is $300k. Now, Desmond is hesitant because he doesn't want to take on the mortgage debt. Cutler is still alive and in possession. The question is about Desmond's liability regarding the mortgage.

The options are A through D. I need to figure out whether Desmond is liable for the mortgage.

So, to recap: Osgood gave Cutler a life estate. Cutler took a mortgage. Osgood died, leaving the property to Desmond with remainder to Deirdre, subject to the mortgage.

In property law, when a life tenant takes out a mortgage, it's a bit tricky. The life tenant has the right to use the property during their life, and they can encumber the property, but the encumbrance only affects their interest, right? So the mortgage would typically only be against Cutler's life estate. Unless someone else assumes the mortgage, the remainder holders aren't personally liable, but the property remains encumbered.

Wait, but the will says Desmond takes it subject to the mortgage. Does that make a difference? Let me think. When a property is devised subject to a mortgage, the devisee (Desmond) takes the property with the mortgage as a lien against it. That means if the mortgage isn't paid, the lender can foreclose on the property. But does that make Desmond personally liable for the debt? Or is the liability limited to the property?

In general, unless the new owner (Desmond) explicitly assumes the mortgage, they aren't personally liable. The lender can only go after the property, not the person. So even though the will says it's subject to the mortgage, Desmond isn't assuming the debt, so he's not personally liable. His only obligation is that if the mortgage isn't paid, the property could be sold to satisfy the debt.

Looking at the options:

A: Liable because he's the devisee under the terms of the will. But the will's terms just mean the property is subject to the mortgage, not that he's assuming the debt.

B: Liable because the property is devised subject to the mortgage. Again, being subject to the mortgage as a lien doesn't make him personally liable unless he assumes it.

C: Not liable because he didn't assume the mortgage. This aligns with what I was thinking. Without assumption, he's not liable.

D: Not liable because he didn't grant the mortgage. That's true, but the reason is more about assumption, not just who granted it.

So the answer should be C. Desmond isn't liable because he didn't assume the mortgage. He takes the property subject to the mortgage lien, but he's not personally on the hook for the debt.

The question revolves around property law and the liability of a devisee for a mortgage encumbering the property. Osgood conveyed Desertacre to Cutler for life, giving Cutler a life estate. Cutler then mortgaged the property for $100,000. Upon Osgood's death, his will devised Desertacre to Desmond, with a remainder to Deirdre, stating that they take the property "subject to Cutler's mortgage." The issue is whether Desmond is personally liable for the mortgage.

Under property law, when a life tenant (Cutler) takes out a mortgage, it typically encumbers only their life estate. The remainder interests (Desmond and Deirdre) are not automatically subject to personal liability for the mortgage unless they explicitly assume it. The will's provision that Desmond and Deirdre take the property "subject to the mortgage" means the property is encumbered by the mortgage lien, but it does not impose personal liability on Desmond for the debt. Without an assumption of the mortgage by Desmond, the lender can only look to the property itself to satisfy the debt, not Desmond personally.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Being a devisee under the will does not make Desmond personally liable for the mortgage unless he assumes it.
- **B**: Incorrect. While the property is devised subject to the mortgage, this creates a lien on the property but does not impose personal liability on Desmond.
- **C**: Correct. Desmond is not liable because he did not assume the mortgage. His obligation is limited to the property being subject to the mortgage lien.
- **D**: Incorrect. While it is true that Desmond did not grant the mortgage, the key issue is whether he assumed it, not who granted it.

Thus, Desmond is not personally liable for the mortgage because he did not assume it.
