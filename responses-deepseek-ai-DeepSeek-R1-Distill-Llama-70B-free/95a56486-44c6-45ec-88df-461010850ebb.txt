Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about cats and their coat colors. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I remember that coat color in cats can be sex-linked, which means the genes are on the sex chromosomes. The question says that the gene B produces a yellow coat, b produces black, and Bb gives tortoiseshell. 

So the parents are a black male and a tortoiseshell female. Let me think about their genotypes. Since it's a sex-linked trait, males are XY and females are XX. 

Wait, wait. The male is black. The gene for black is b, so if the male is black, his genotype must be XbY. Because males have only one X chromosome, right? So if it's b, they express black. 

The female is tortoiseshell, which is Bb. Since she's female, she has two X chromosomes. So her genotype is XBXb. Because Bb makes tortoiseshell.

So now, I need to figure out the possible offspring from these two parents. Let's think about the possible gametes each can produce.

The father is XbY. So when he produces sperm, each gamete will have either Xb or Y. Because the X and Y are separate chromosomes, right? So 50% chance of Xb and 50% chance of Y.

The mother is XBXb. So for her eggs, she can produce either XB or Xb gametes. So 50% XB and 50% Xb.

Now, let's consider all the possible combinations. The offspring's X comes from the mother, and the Y comes from the father for males. Wait, no, the father can only give Y or X, but since the father's X is Xb, and the mother's X is either XB or Xb.

Wait, let me clarify. The father's gametes are Xb (from the X chromosome) and Y. The mother's gametes are XB and Xb.

So for sons (males), they get Y from dad and X from mom. So the possible X from mom is either XB or Xb. So sons can be XbY (from mom's Xb) or XB Y (from mom's XB). Because the Y comes from dad, making them male.

So for daughters, they get an X from each parent. So from dad, it's Xb, and from mom, it's either XB or Xb. So daughter's genotype would be Xb (from dad) and XB (from mom) → XBXb, which is tortoiseshell. Or Xb (dad) and Xb (mom) → XbXb, which is black.

Wait, but the mother's gametes are XB and Xb, so for daughters:

Case 1: Mother's gamete is XB, father gives Xb → daughter is XBXb (tortoiseshell)
Case 2: Mother's gamete is Xb, father gives Xb → daughter is XbXb (black)

So the daughters have a 50% chance of being tortoiseshell and 50% black.

For sons:

They get Y from dad and X from mom. So:

Case 1: Mother's gamete is XB → son is XB Y → which is XY with X being B. So phenotype is yellow.
Case 2: Mother's gamete is Xb → son is Xb Y → which is Xb, so phenotype is black.

So sons have 50% chance of yellow and 50% chance of black.

Putting it all together:

Daughters: 50% tortoiseshell, 50% black
Sons: 50% yellow, 50% black

Wait, but in the question, the options don't quite separate the daughters and sons like that. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: 1/4 tortoise-shell F, 1/4 black F, 1/4 yellow M, 1/4 black M → This would be if each had 25% chance, but that's not the case here.

B: All yellow males → No, because sons are 50% yellow and 50% black.

C: 1/2 yellow F and 1/2 black M → No, because females can't be yellow if the father is XbY, right? Because females get X from dad, which is Xb. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, wait another moment. Let me think again about the phenotypes. The B gene is for yellow. So if the daughter is XBXb, that's tortoiseshell. If she's XbXb, that's black. So females cannot be yellow since they have two X's. Only males can be yellow, because the Y doesn't have a corresponding gene. So males only need one B to be yellow. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify the genetics.

The gene B is on the X chromosome. So for males, having a B on their single X would mean yellow. So, if a son gets X^B from mom, he'll be X^B Y, which is yellow. If he gets X^b, he'll be X^b Y, which is black.

So sons can be either yellow (XB Y) or black (Xb Y). So 50% each.

Daughters get X from each parent. So from dad, it's Xb. From mom, it's either XB or Xb.

So if daughter is Xb (dad) and XB (mom) → XBXb → tortoiseshell.

If daughter is Xb (dad) and Xb (mom) → XbXb → black.

So 50% each.

So the possible offspring are:

- Sons: 50% yellow, 50% black.
- Daughters: 50% tortoiseshell, 50% black.

So in terms of probabilities, each offspring has an equal chance of being male or female, assuming equal probability (but actually, in real life, the sex ratio is roughly 1:1, so each has about 50% chance).

Wait, but when you have a cross like this, each child has a 50% chance of being male and 50% female, right? So the overall probabilities would be:

Each child is:

- 25% chance of being a daughter with tortoiseshell (50% female * 50% tortoise)
- 25% chance of being a daughter black (50% *50%)
- 25% chance of being a son yellow (50% male *50% yellow)
- 25% chance of being a son black (50% *50% )

So that's 25% each. Looking at the options, option A is (1/4) tortoise-shell F, (1/4) black F, (1/4) yellow M, (1/4) black M.

But wait, in the setup, the male parent is XbY (black), and the female is XBXb (tortoiseshell).

Wait, wait, no, wait: the female is XBXb, so she can produce two types of eggs: XB and Xb. Each with 50% chance.

The male can produce Xb (50%) and Y (50%).

So for the daughters: they get Xb from dad (since Y makes sons), and either XB or Xb from mom.

So for daughters:

XB (mom) + Xb (dad) → XBXb → tortoiseshell.

Xb (mom) + Xb (dad) → XbXb → black.

So 50% each.

Sons get Y from dad and either XB or Xb from mom.

So sons:

XB (mom) + Y (dad) → XBY → yellow.

Xb (mom) + Y (dad) → XbY → black.

So 50% each.

So the possible kids are:

Daughters:

- 50% tortoiseshell.
- 50% black.

Sons:

- 50% yellow.
- 50% black.

But each child has a 50% chance of being a daughter and 50% son.

So overall, the probabilities are:

- 25% tortoiseshell daughters.
- 25% black daughters.
- 25% yellow sons.
- 25% black sons.

So that's what option A says: 1/4 each.

Looking at the options, option A is that exact distribution.

Option D says 1/2 black females and 1/2 yellow males. No, because that would sum to more than 100%.

Wait, let me recheck the options.

Option A: (1/4) tortoise-shell F, (1/4) black F, (1/4) yellow M, (1/4) black M.

Yes, that's exactly the breakdown we've got.

But wait, looking again, the question asks "what kind of offspring". So the answer should be A.

But wait, wait, I thought that for the male's gametes, it's Xb and Y, each 50%. The female's gametes are XB and Xb, each 50%.

So the possible offspring would be:

- XBXb (tortoise F) → 25%.
- XbXb (black F) → 25%.
- XBY (yellow M) →25%.
- XbY (black M) →25%.

So option A is exactly that.

Let me look at the options again:

A: (1/4) tortoise-shell F, (1/4) black F, (1/4) yellow M, (1/4) black M.

Yes.

So the correct answer should be A.
</think>

The question involves a sex-linked gene for coat color in cats, where the gene \( B \) produces a yellow coat, \( b \) produces a black coat, and the heterozygous \( Bb \) produces a tortoiseshell coat. The mating involves a black male (\( X^bY \)) and a tortoiseshell female (\( X^BX^b \)).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Parent Genotypes**:
   - The black male has the genotype \( X^bY \). He can produce two types of gametes: \( X^b \) (50%) and \( Y \) (50%).
   - The tortoiseshell female has the genotype \( X^BX^b \). She can produce two types of gametes: \( X^B \) (50%) and \( X^b \) (50%).

2. **Offspring Genotypes**:
   - **Daughters** inherit \( X^b \) from the father and either \( X^B \) or \( X^b \) from the mother:
     - \( X^B \) (from mother) + \( X^b \) (from father) → \( X^BX^b \) (tortoiseshell, 50%).
     - \( X^b \) (from mother) + \( X^b \) (from father) → \( X^bX^b \) (black, 50%).
   - **Sons** inherit \( Y \) from the father and either \( X^B \) or \( X^b \) from the mother:
     - \( X^B \) (from mother) + \( Y \) (from father) → \( X^BY \) (yellow, 50%).
     - \( X^b \) (from mother) + \( Y \) (from father) → \( X^bY \) (black, 50%).

3. **Overall Probabilities**:
   - Each offspring has an equal chance of being male or female (approximately 50% each).
   - Combining the probabilities:
     - 25% chance of a tortoiseshell female (\( X^BX^b \)).
     - 25% chance of a black female (\( X^bX^b \)).
     - 25% chance of a yellow male (\( X^BY \)).
     - 25% chance of a black male (\( X^bY \)).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: (1/4) tortoiseshell females, (1/4) black females, (1/4) yellow males, and (1/4) black males.  
  This matches the calculated probabilities exactly.
- **Option B**: All yellow males. Incorrect, as sons can also be black.
- **Option C**: (1/2) yellow females and (1/2) black males. Incorrect, as females cannot be yellow (they require two \( X \) chromosomes).
- **Option D**: (1/2) black females and (1/2) yellow males. Incorrect, as it excludes tortoiseshell females and black males.
- **Option E**: (1/3) black males, (1/3) yellow males, and (1/3) tortoiseshell females. Incorrect, as it does not account for black females and misrepresents the probabilities.
- **Option F**: All black offspring. Incorrect, as yellow and tortoiseshell offspring are also possible.
- **Option G**: All black males. Incorrect, as sons can also be yellow.
- **Option H**: (1/2) yellow males and (1/2) tortoiseshell females. Incorrect, as it excludes black males and black females.
- **Option I**: All tortoiseshell females. Incorrect, as males and black females are also possible.
- **Option J**: (1/2) tortoiseshell females and (1/2) black males. Incorrect, as it excludes yellow males and black females.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option A**, as it accurately reflects the probabilities of the offspring: (1/4) tortoiseshell females, (1/4) black females, (1/4) yellow males, and (1/4) black males.
