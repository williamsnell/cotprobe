Question:

A 37-year-old woman with AIDS comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of progressive diarrhea and a 1.8- kg (4-lb) weight loss. During the past week, she has had six large watery stools daily. She is currently receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. She is employed as a flight attendant and works regularly on domestic flights throughout the USA. She also flies to Asia at least once monthly. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 112/64 mm Hg. The abdomen is scaphoid. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 400/mm3 (Normal≥500). Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?

Options:

A: Cryptosporidium parvum
B: Cytomegalovirus
C: Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex
D: Salmonella enteritidis

Okay, so I have this question about a woman with AIDS presenting with diarrhea and weight loss. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

First, the patient is a 37-year-old woman with AIDS. She's on triple antiretroviral therapy, which is good because that usually helps manage the disease. But she's having a lot of diarrhea—six large watery stools a day for the past week. She's lost about 4 pounds in a month, which is significant. Her CD4 count is 400, which is below the normal threshold of 500. So her immune system isn't great, but it's not super low either.

She works as a flight attendant, flying domestically and to Asia monthly. That makes me think about possible exposures she might have had while traveling. Maybe she was exposed to some pathogens in the water or food in different countries.

Her BMI is 22, which is normal, but the weight loss could be concerning. Her physical exam shows a scaphoid abdomen, which I think means it's concave, maybe indicating she's lost some abdominal muscle mass or fat. But no other abnormalities—no fever, normal blood pressure, so she's not in acute distress.

The question is asking for the most likely causal organism of her symptoms. The options are Cryptosporidium parvum, Cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAC), and Salmonella enteritidis.

Let me think about each option.

Starting with Cryptosporidium parvum. I remember that Cryptosporidiosis causes a lot of watery diarrhea, especially in immunocompromised patients. It's a protozoan parasite. People with low CD4 counts are more susceptible to severe and prolonged diarrhea from crypto. Since she's been having this for a month and has a low CD4, that might fit. Also, it's spread through contaminated water or food, so maybe she picked it up while traveling.

Next, Cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV can cause a lot of issues in HIV/AIDS patients, especially when their CD4 is very low. But CMV colitis usually presents with more systemic symptoms like fever and abdominal pain. She doesn't have a fever here, and her abdomen was scaphoid, so maybe CMV isn't the first thought. Plus, CMV tends to cause more bloody diarrhea sometimes, or if it's colitis, it can cause different symptoms.

Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) is another opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients. MAC typically causes systemic symptoms like night sweats, fever, weight loss, and can affect the GI tract. But the presentation here is mainly diarrhea without other symptoms. MAC infection might cause more of a malabsorption issue rather than acute watery diarrhea. Plus, her CD4 is 400, which is a bit higher than when MAC usually hits (typically below 50). So maybe MAC isn't the most likely here.

Salmonella enteritidis. Well, Salmonella can cause enteritis, which leads to diarrhea, but it's usually more acute. Also, in immunocompromised patients, Salmonella can cause bacteremia or more severe disease. But her presentation is a month-long, which seems longer than typical Salmonella, which is usually a few days to a week. Also, Salmonella tends to cause more inflammatory diarrhea with some blood or mucus, not just large watery stools. So maybe Salmonella isn't the main suspect here.

Putting it all together: she's immunocompromised, with a CD4 of 400, which is still low but not extremely low. She's had prolonged watery diarrhea. Cryptosporidium is known for causing prolonged diarrhea in HIV patients. Also, her job as a flight attendant might expose her to contaminated water sources when traveling, especially in Asia. So Crypto seems to fit best.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: she's on antiretroviral therapy. Maybe her CD4 is better because of that, but she's still below normal. Also, Crypto can cause intractable diarrhea in such patients. Yeah, I think the answer is A, Cryptosporidium parvum.

The patient is a 37-year-old woman with AIDS, a CD4 count of 400/mm³, and a 1-month history of progressive watery diarrhea and weight loss. She is on triple antiretroviral therapy and works as a flight attendant, frequently traveling domestically and to Asia. Her symptoms include six large watery stools daily, significant weight loss, and a scaphoid abdomen, but no fever or other systemic symptoms. The differential diagnosis includes Cryptosporidium parvum, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC), and Salmonella enteritidis.

- **Cryptosporidium parvum**: This protozoan parasite is a common cause of prolonged watery diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with CD4 counts below 500. It is spread through contaminated water or food, which aligns with her travel history. Her symptoms of prolonged watery diarrhea and weight loss are consistent with cryptosporidiosis, making this the most likely diagnosis.

- **Cytomegalovirus (CMV)**: CMV colitis typically presents with systemic symptoms such as fever and abdominal pain, which are absent in this patient. Additionally, CMV is more commonly associated with bloody diarrhea or colitis rather than the watery diarrhea described here.

- **Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC)**: MAC infections are more common in HIV/AIDS patients with very low CD4 counts (typically below 50). While MAC can cause weight loss and diarrhea, it often presents with systemic symptoms like night sweats and fever, which are not present in this case. The patient’s CD4 count of 400 makes MAC less likely.

- **Salmonella enteritidis**: Salmonella typically causes acute diarrhea, often with blood or mucus, and resolves within a week. This patient’s symptoms have persisted for a month, making Salmonella a less likely cause.

Given her immunocompromised state, travel history, and clinical presentation of prolonged watery diarrhea and weight loss, Cryptosporidium parvum is the most likely causal organism.
