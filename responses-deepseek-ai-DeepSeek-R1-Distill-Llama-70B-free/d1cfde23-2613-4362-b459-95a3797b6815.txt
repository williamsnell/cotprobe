Okay, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about China's GDP per capita growth from 1950 to 2016, adjusted for inflation and PPP. Hmm, I remember that China has had a lot of economic growth, especially after the reforms in 1978. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers.

So, the question is asking how much the GDP per capita increased over that period. The options are from about 4 fold up to 64 fold. I think China's growth was really high, but I'm not sure if it's as high as 64 times.

Wait, I recall that in the mid-20th century, especially around 1950, China was very poor. Their GDP per capita must have been quite low. After the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, there was a lot of economic disruption, but then after Deng Xiaoping's reforms, the economy started to take off.

I think by 2016, China had become the second-largest economy in the world. But that's total GDP, not per capita. Per capita would be lower because the population is so large. So I'm trying to remember some specific data points. Maybe around 1950, China's GDP per capita was something like $400 (in PPP terms), and by 2016, it was around $14,000? So that's an increase of 35 times. But wait, I'm not sure if those numbers are accurate.

Alternatively, I've heard that between 1978 and 2016, China's GDP per capita grew about 25 times. But the question starts from 1950, which is earlier. From 1950 to 1978, China's economy was more stagnant, maybe even some decline during the Great Leap Forward. So perhaps the growth from 1950 to 2016 isn't as high as 25 times, but more than that because the earlier period was so low.

Wait, another angle. The options given are A:20, B:12, C:25, D:64, E:8, F:4, G:50, H:40, I:16, J:32. So looking for an approximate factor.

I think I've read that China's GDP per capita in 1950 was about $400 (PPP-adjusted), and by 2016, it's around maybe $14,000. Let me do the math: 14,000 divided by 400 is 35. So that's about a 35-fold increase. Looking at the options, the closest higher would be G:50, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe my numbers are off.

Wait, perhaps in 1950, China's GDP per capita was lower, maybe around $200. Then 2016's $14,000 would be 70 times. But that's even higher than the options given. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the increase is less. I remember that from 1978 to 2016, it's about 25 times, but including the earlier years might not add that much. Because from 1950 to 1978, the growth was slower or even negative at times.

Wait, another approach: I think the World Bank or Maddison's historical data might have these numbers. Maddison's estimates are often used for historical GDP. According to some sources, China's GDP per capita in 1950 (in 1990 PPP dollars) was around $400, and by 2016, it was around $14,000. So 14,000 / 400 is 35 times. But 35 isn't an option here. The closest options are C:25, G:50, or maybe others.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the base year for PPP adjustment. The question says PPP-adjusted and inflation-controlled. Maybe the numbers are different. Alternatively, perhaps the increase is around 25 times, which would be option C. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: I've heard that China's GDP growth since the reforms is one of the highest in history. But from 1950 to 2016, that's a longer period, including some years of stagnation. So maybe the total increase is around 25-30 times. But the options don't have 30. So the closest higher would be G:50 or C:25.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the answer is around 25 fold, which is option C. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, I've heard that from 1978 to 2016, it's 25 times, so including the earlier years might make it a bit more. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 50 fold, option G. But I'm not certain. I think some sources say that China's GDP per capita increased by about 50 times from 1950 to 2016. So maybe G is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think of it another way. If from 1978 to 2016 is 25 times, then from 1950 to 2016 would be more than that because 1950-1978 was a period of lower growth. So perhaps the total is about 32 times, which is option J. Or maybe 40 times, option H.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. I think I'll go with option C:25 fold, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 16 fold, but that seems too low.

Wait, I think another approach: the total GDP growth from 1950 to 2016 must be higher than the post-1978 period alone. So if post-1978 is 25 times, then including the earlier period, perhaps it's about 32 times. So option J.

Alternatively, perhaps I've read that China's GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016 grew about 25 times. So I'm a bit confused. Maybe the answer is C:25 fold.

Wait, I think I'll go with option C:25 fold. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's 16 fold. No, that seems too low. I think I'll settle on option C.

The question asks about the increase in China's GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016, adjusted for inflation and PPP. To estimate this, historical data suggests that China's GDP per capita in 1950 was around $400 (in PPP terms), while by 2016, it had risen to approximately $14,000. This represents a roughly 35-fold increase. However, the options provided do not include 35, so the closest higher option is G:50. 

Considering the broader context, China's economic growth was heavily influenced by the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, and the economic reforms starting in 1978. While the post-1978 period saw rapid growth (around 25-fold), the earlier years were marked by stagnation or even decline. This makes the total growth from 1950 to 2016 likely higher than the post-1978 figure but not as high as 50-fold. 

After evaluating the options and considering potential inaccuracies in historical estimates, the most reasonable choice is C:25 fold, as it aligns with the general understanding of China's GDP per capita growth over this period.

Answer: C
