Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about calculating the heat of reaction for two different processes using the standard heats of formation provided. Hmm, I remember that the heat of reaction, ΔH°, is calculated using the formula where the sum of the heats of formation of the products minus the sum of the reactants gives the heat of reaction. Oh wait, right, it's products minus reactants, right. 

So the problem has two parts, a and b. Let me tackle them one by one.

Starting with part a: the reaction is CaCl2(s) + Na2CO3(s) → 2NaCl(s) + CaCO3(s). I need to find the ΔH° for this reaction.

The formula I remember is ΔH° = ΣΔH°(products) - ΣΔH°(reactants). So I should look up the ΔH° values for each substance involved.

Looking at the data table:

- CaCl2(s) is -190.0 kcal/mol
- Na2CO3(s) is -270.3 kcal/mol
- NaCl(s) is -98.2 kcal/mol
- CaCO3(s) is -288.4 kcal/mol

So the reactants are CaCl2 and Na2CO3. Their ΔH°s are -190.0 and -270.3, respectively. The products are 2 moles of NaCl and 1 mole of CaCO3.

Calculating the sum for the products:

2 * (-98.2) + (-288.4) = (-196.4) + (-288.4) = -484.8 kcal.

Now the sum for the reactants:

(-190.0) + (-270.3) = -460.3 kcal.

Wait no, wait. Wait, no, wait. No. Correction. The sum of reactants is just CaCl2 and Na2CO3. So that's -190 + (-270.3) = -460.3.

So ΔH° = (-484.8) - (-460.3) = (-484.8) + 460.3 = -24.5 kcal/mol. Hmm, that's for part a. So that's -24.5.

Now part b: H2SO4(l) + 2NaCl(s) → Na2SO4(s) + 2HCl(g). Find ΔH° for this reaction.

Again, using the same approach. Let's get the ΔH° values.

H2SO4(l) is -193.9
NaCl(s) is -98.2 (but there's 2 moles, so 2*(-98.2) = -196.4)
So reactants sum: (-193.9) + (-196.4) = -390.3.

Products: Na2SO4(s) is -330.9, and 2 HCl(g) is 2*(-22.1) = -44.2. So sum of products: (-330.9) + (-44.2) = -375.1.

So ΔH° = (-375.1) - (-390.3) = (-375.1 + 390.3) = 15.2 kcal. Wait, but I'm confused. Because when I subtract a negative, it becomes positive. So if products are lower than reactants, the reaction is exothermic, but here it's positive, meaning endothermic.

Wait, wait, but let me check the numbers again.

Reactants: H2SO4 is -193.9. 2 moles of NaCl is 2*(-98.2) = -196.4. Sum: -193.9 - 196.4 = -390.3.

Products: Na2SO4 is -330.9. 2 moles of HCl(g) is 2*(-22.1) = -44.2. Sum: -330.9 + (-44.2) = -375.1.

So ΔH° = (-375.1) - (-390.3) = 15.2. Wait, that would make the reaction endothermic, but let me double-check the subtraction. Oh, wait, no—wait, the formula is products minus reactants. So, it's [sum products] - [sum reactants] = (-375.1) - (-390.3) = 15.2. So the ΔH° is +15.2 kcal/mol. But wait, looking at the answer options, I don't see 15.2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the values.

H2SO4(l): ΔH is -193.9. Correct.
NaCl(s): 2 moles, so 2*(-98.2) = -196.4. Correct.
Sum of reactants: -193.9 + (-196.4) = -390.3. Correct.

Products:
Na2SO4(s): -330.9. Correct.
HCl(g): 2*(-22.1) = -44.2. Correct.
Sum: -330.9 + (-44.2) = -375.1. Correct.

So ΔH° = (-375.1) - (-390.3) = 15.2. So that's +15.2 kcal/mol. But wait, looking at the options, part a was -24.5, which matches option C's first value (option C: -24.5 and -16.4). But part b is 15.2. Wait, but none of the options have a positive value for part b.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the products and reactants.

Wait, in reaction b: the reactants are H2SO4 and NaCl. Products are Na2SO4 and HCl.

So the sum for the products is [Na2SO4] + [HCl], which is -330.9 + 2*(-22.1) = -330.9 -44.2 = -375.1.

Sum of reactants: [H2SO4] + [2 NaCl] = (-193.9) + (2*(-98.2)) = -193.9 -196.4 = -390.3.

So products minus reactants: (-375.1) - (-390.3) = 15.2. So that's positive, meaning the reaction is endothermic. But looking at the options, for part b, all the second values are negative. Hmm. That suggests I might have made a mistake.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me check if I used the correct signs. Because the standard heats of formation are given as ΔH°, which is the heat absorbed when 1 mole is formed from elements. So for products, they are being formed, so their ΔH° is added as products, and subtracted as reactants.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. The formula is ΔH° = sum (ΔH°f(products)) - sum (ΔH°f(reactants)).

So for reaction b:

sum (products) = [Na2SO4] + 2[HCl] = (-330.9) + 2*(-22.1) = -375.1.

sum (reactants) = [H2SO4] + 2[NaCl] = (-193.9) + 2*(-98.2) = -193.9 -196.4 = -390.3.

So ΔH° = (-375.1) - (-390.3) = 15.2. So positive.

But the answer options for part b are all negative. That suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the sign, or I might have mixed up the products and reactants. Let me check the reaction again.

Wait, the reaction is H2SO4(l) + 2NaCl(s) → Na2SO4(s) + 2HCl(g). So the products are Na2SO4 and HCl.

So the calculation seems correct, but according to the options, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the HCl is a product, so it's being formed. So its ΔH° is part of the products. So no, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the reverse? Or maybe the values are for the reverse reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I should have done reactants minus products. Wait, no, the formula is products minus reactants.

Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation in the arithmetic. Let me recheck:

sum reactants for b: H2SO4 is -193.9. 2 NaCl is 2*(-98.2) = -196.4. So sum reactants: -193.9 + (-196.4) = -390.3.

sum products: Na2SO4 is -330.9. 2 HCl is 2*(-22.1)= -44.2. So sum products: -330.9 + (-44.2) = -375.1.

ΔH° = sum products - sum reactants = (-375.1) - (-390.3) = 15.2. So that's +15.2, which is endothermic.

But looking back at the options, for part b, the second numbers are all negative. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the ΔH° values are given with the opposite sign convention.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the ΔH° of H2SO4 is positive? Let me check. No, the table says H2SO4(l) is -193.9. Yes.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered that the reaction for HCl is written as HCl(g), but in the formation it's from elements. Maybe that's not the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck:

sum products: -330.9 (Na2SO4) + 2*(-22.1) (HCl) = -330.9 -44.2 = -375.1.

sum reactants: -193.9 + 2*(-98.2) = -193.9 -196.4 = -390.3.

ΔH° = (-375.1) - (-390.3) = 15.2. So that's correct. Hmm.

Looking at the options, part a is -24.5, which is option C or J. Let me look at the options:

Option C: a) -24.5, b) -16.4

Option J: a) -23.5, b) -18.4.

Wait, I'm getting a) as -24.5 and b) as +15.2. But none of the options have a positive for part b. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction for part b.

Wait, perhaps I should reverse the calculation. Let me see: Maybe I should have subtracted the other way around. Let me try that.

If I compute sum reactants minus sum products, that would be -390.3 - (-375.1) = -15.2. So that would make the ΔH° negative, -15.2, but I thought the formula is products minus reactants.

Wait, no, the formula is definitely products minus reactants. So I think my calculation is correct, but perhaps the given options have a typo, or I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the HCl is a reactant, but no, the reaction is H2SO4 + NaCl → Na2SO4 + HCl. So HCl is a product, so it's included in the products sum.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ΔH° values are in terms of the reverse reaction. For example, maybe the data gives the formation of each compound from elements, so when it's a product, you use it as is, when it's a reactant, you subtract it.

Wait, perhaps I should write the formation reactions for each substance and then combine them.

Wait, for reaction a, let's break it down:

The reaction is CaCl2(s) + Na2CO3(s) → 2NaCl(s) + CaCO3(s).

We can write each substance as their formation from elements.

For CaCl2(s): Ca(s) + 2Cl2(g) → CaCl2(s); ΔH = -190.0 kcal/mol.

For Na2CO3(s): 2Na(s) + C(s) + 3O2(g) → Na2CO3(s); ΔH = -270.3.

For NaCl(s): Na(s) + ½Cl2(g) → NaCl(s); ΔH = -98.2. But since we have 2 moles, multiply by 2.

For CaCO3(s): Ca(s) + C(s) + 3O2(g) → CaCO3(s); ΔH = -288.4.

So the overall reaction is:

CaCl2 + Na2CO3 → 2NaCl + CaCO3.

To get this, we need to manipulate the formation reactions.

Let me write each formation reaction:

1. Ca(s) + 2Cl2 → CaCl2(s); ΔH = -190.0.

2. 2Na(s) + C(s) + 3O2 → Na2CO3(s); ΔH = -270.3.

3. Na(s) + ½Cl2 → NaCl(s); ΔH = -98.2. So for 2 moles: 2Na(s) + Cl2 → 2NaCl(s); ΔH= 2*(-98.2) = -196.4.

4. Ca(s) + C(s) + 3O2 → CaCO3(s); ΔH = -288.4.

Now, the target reaction is CaCl2 + Na2CO3 → 2NaCl + CaCO3.

Let me see how to combine these.

We can reverse reaction 1 to get CaCl2 → Ca + 2Cl2; ΔH = +190.0.

Reverse reaction 4 to get CaCO3 → Ca + C + 3O2; ΔH = +288.4.

Keep reaction 2 as is: 2Na + C + 3O2 → Na2CO3; ΔH = -270.3.

Keep reaction 3 as is: 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl; ΔH= -196.4.

Hmm, perhaps another approach would be better.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write the target reaction in terms of the formation reactions.

The target equation is:

CaCl2(s) + Na2CO3(s) → 2 NaCl(s) + CaCO3(s).

We can write each reactant as decomposing into elements, and each product as forming from elements.

So, the steps are:

1. Decompose CaCl2 into Ca and Cl2:

CaCl2 → Ca + 2Cl2; ΔH = +190.0.

2. Decompose Na2CO3 into 2Na, C, and 3O2:

Na2CO3 → 2Na + C + 3O2; ΔH = +270.3.

3. Form 2 NaCl from 2Na and Cl2:

2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl; ΔH = -196.4.

4. Form CaCO3 from Ca, C, and 3O2:

Ca + C + 3O2 → CaCO3; ΔH = -288.4.

Now, adding these steps together:

Step 1: CaCl2 → Ca + 2Cl2; ΔH=+190.

Step 2: Na2CO3 → 2Na + C + 3O2; ΔH=+270.3.

Step 3: 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl; ΔH=-196.4.

Step 4: Ca + C + 3O2 → CaCO3; ΔH=-288.4.

Now, sum all these steps:

CaCl2 + Na2CO3 → Ca + 2Cl2 + 2Na + C + 3O2.

Then, in step 3 and 4, we use Ca, C, 3O2, and Cl2.

So, the overall reaction becomes:

CaCl2 + Na2CO3 → 2NaCl + CaCO3.

Which matches the target equation. Now, summing the ΔH values:

190.0 + 270.3 + (-196.4) + (-288.4) = ?

Calculating:

190 + 270.3 = 460.3.

460.3 -196.4 = 263.9.

263.9 -288.4 = -24.5 kcal/mol.

So that's correct for part a: -24.5.

Now for part b, perhaps I should use the same approach to check.

Reaction b: H2SO4(l) + 2NaCl(s) → Na2SO4(s) + 2HCl(g).

Write each substance as their formation reactions.

Formation reactions:

H2SO4(l): S(s) + 2H2(g) + 3O2(g) → H2SO4(l); ΔH = -193.9.

NaCl(s): Na(s) + ½Cl2 → NaCl(s); ΔH = -98.2. For 2 moles: 2Na(s) + Cl2 → 2NaCl(s); ΔH= 2*(-98.2)= -196.4.

Products:

Na2SO4(s): 2Na(s) + S(s) + 4O2(g) → Na2SO4(s); ΔH = -330.9.

HCl(g): ½H2(g) + ½Cl2(g) → HCl(g); ΔH = -22.1. For 2 moles: H2 + Cl2 → 2HCl; ΔH= 2*(-22.1)= -44.2.

The target reaction is H2SO4 + 2NaCl → Na2SO4 + 2HCl.

So, let's break it down into steps:

1. Decompose H2SO4 into S, H2, and O2:

H2SO4 → S + 2H2 + 3O2; ΔH = +193.9.

2. Decompose 2NaCl into 2Na and Cl2:

2NaCl → 2Na + Cl2; ΔH = +196.4.

3. Form Na2SO4 from 2Na, S, and 4O2:

2Na + S + 4O2 → Na2SO4; ΔH = -330.9.

4. Form 2HCl from H2 and Cl2:

H2 + Cl2 → 2HCl; ΔH = -44.2.

Now, adding these steps:

Step 1: H2SO4 → S + 2H2 + 3O2; ΔH=+193.9.
