Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about X-rays and rock salt. Hmm, I remember that X-ray diffraction has something to do with Bragg's Law. Right, Bragg's Law is nλ = 2d sinθ. So the question says that the scattered X-rays have an intense maximum at 20 degrees. And n is given as 1, so it's the first-order diffraction.

Wait, what's 'd' in this case? Oh right, for rock salt (NaCl), the d-spacing is the distance between the crystal planes. I think the d value for NaCl is a known value. I remember that the interplanar spacing for NaCl is about 0.282 nanometers. Or was it something else? Wait, I might be mixing it up. Let me think. Rock salt has a face-centered cubic structure, so the d-spacing for the (200) planes or something like that. Oh wait, the (111) planes maybe? No, the most intense reflection is often from the (200) planes in NaCl. I think the d-spacing for NaCl is around 0.282 nm, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, I've heard it's about 0.28 nm. Let me double-check in my notes—if I had any.

Assuming the d-spacing is 0.282 nm, and θ is 20 degrees. Oh wait, the angle given is 20 degrees from the incident direction. So that's the theta in Bragg's equation.

So plugging into Bragg's Law: nλ = 2d sinθ. n is 1, so λ = 2d sinθ. Let me compute that. d is 0.282e-9 meters. Wait, wait, no, the units are in nanometers, so 0.282 nm is 0.282e-9 m. Theta is 20 degrees, so the sine of 20 degrees is... I think sin(20) is approximately 0.3420.

So plugging in the numbers: λ = 2 * 0.282 nm * sin(20°). Let me calculate that: 2 * 0.282 = 0.564. Multiply by 0.342: 0.564 * 0.342. Let me do that multiplication. 0.5 * 0.342 is 0.171, and 0.064 * 0.342 is about 0.0219. Adding together, 0.171 + 0.0219 is 0.1929 nm. So approximately 0.193 nm.

Looking at the options, I don't see exactly 0.193. Let me check the options again. The options are A:0.30, B:0.20, C:0.15, D:1.00, E:0.65, F:1.50, G:0.50, H:0.25, I:0.075, J:0.098.

Hmm, 0.20 is option B, 0.25 is H. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate:

2 * 0.282 = 0.564. 0.564 * sin(20). Sin(20) is about 0.3420. So 0.564 * 0.3420.

Let me compute 0.564 * 0.342:

0.5 * 0.342 = 0.171.

0.064 * 0.342 = let's see, 0.06 * 0.342 is 0.02052, and 0.004 * 0.342 is 0.001368. Adding them gives 0.021888.

So total is 0.171 + 0.021888 = 0.192888 nm, which is approximately 0.193 nm.

But none of the options exactly match that. Oh wait, perhaps I got the d-spacing wrong. Another thought: maybe the d-spacing is different, like 0.28 nm, but let me think. Wait, NaCl has a lattice parameter of about 0.564 nm. So for the (200) planes, the interplanar spacing d is a/(h^2 + k^2 + l^2)^(1/2) for a cubic system. So for (200), h=2, k=0, l=0. So d = a / (2^2)^(1/2) = a/(2). So a is 0.564 nm, then d = 0.564 / 2 = 0.282 nm. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different assumption. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the angle is in radians? No, the problem says 20 degrees, so that's correct.

Wait another thought: sometimes in some contexts, people use theta as the angle between the incident and diffracted beams, which is twice the angle between the incident and the crystal planes. Wait no, Bragg's Law uses theta as the angle between the incoming X-ray and the crystal plane. So in the problem, the X-rays are scattered at 20 degrees from the incident direction, which would make theta 20 degrees. So that's correct.

Hmm. So with the calculation giving approximately 0.193 nm, which isn't one of the options. The closest option is B:0.20, but that's 0.20. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately: 0.564 * 0.3420.

Let me compute 0.564 * 0.342.

0.5 * 0.342 = 0.171.

0.064 * 0.342: 0.06 * 0.342 = 0.02052, 0.004*0.342=0.001368. So total 0.021888.

Adding to 0.171 gives 0.192888 nm, which is 0.1929 nm. So approximately 0.193 nm.

Looking again, the options: B is 0.20, H is 0.25. So 0.193 is closer to 0.20 than to 0.15 or 0.25. So perhaps the correct answer is B:0.20. But wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the first order (n=1), but perhaps the d-spacing is different. Maybe for a different set of planes? For example, (220) planes.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the Miller indices, just says rock salt. So perhaps I should assume the (200) planes, which are the primary diffraction planes for NaCl. Alternatively, perhaps using the (111) planes, but I think NaCl's strongest reflection is from (200).

Wait, maybe I should double-check the d-spacing for NaCl. Let me see, the lattice constant a for NaCl is about 0.564 nm. So for (200) planes, d = a / sqrt(2² + 0 + 0) )= a/2 = 0.564 / 2 = 0.282 nm. Yep, that's correct.

Alternatively, if the problem uses a different value for d. Wait, perhaps the problem uses d = 0.28 nm for simplicity. Let's try that: 2 * 0.28 = 0.56. 0.56 * sin(20) = 0.56 * 0.342 = 0.19152 nm, which is about 0.1915. Still about 0.192 nm.

Hmm. So none of the options exactly match 0.192. But the available options are 0.20 (B), 0.25 (H), 0.15 (C), etc.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different value for d. Maybe I should think about the relationship between the wavelength and the angle. Another approach: perhaps using the options to work backward.

Let's try option B: 0.20 nm.

If λ is 0.20 nm, then using Bragg's Law:

nλ = 2d sinθ => sinθ = (nλ)/(2d).

n=1, so sinθ = (0.20) / (2 * 0.282) ) = 0.20 / 0.564 ≈ 0.3546.

What angle has a sine of ~0.3546? Let's see, sin(20) is 0.342, sin(21) is approx 0.3584. So 0.3546 is around 20.8 or 21 degrees. The problem says the maximum is at 20 degrees. Hmm, so that's a bit off.

What if λ was 0.193 nm, which is our calculated value. Then sinθ would be (0.193) / (2 * 0.282) = 0.193 / 0.564 ≈ 0.342, which matches sin(20 degrees). So that makes sense.

But since none of the options exactly match 0.193, perhaps the intended answer is H:0.25? Let me check. If λ is 0.25 nm, then sinθ = 0.25/(2*0.282) = 0.25 / 0.564 ≈ 0.443. What's that in degrees? Sin(26.2) is about 0.443. So the angle would be about 26.2 degrees, but the question says 20. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the d-spacing. What if the d-spacing was 0.28 nm? Then 2d is 0.56 nm. For λ = 0.20 nm, sinθ = 0.20/(2*0.28) = 0.20/0.56 ≈ 0.357. Which is sin(21 degrees). Close to 20, but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B:0.20 nm, considering some rounding.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the value of d is taken as 0.28 nm exactly. Let me see. For d=0.28, λ = 2d sinθ. So λ = 2 * 0.28 * sin(20) = 0.56 * 0.342 ≈ 0.1915 nm. So 0.1915 is approximately 0.192 nm. Still not matching any option.

Looking at the options again, perhaps option H:0.25 is too big, option B:0.20 is 0.20, which is a bit higher than 0.192.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for sin(20). Maybe using a more precise value. Let me calculate sin(20 degrees) precisely. Using calculator: sin(20°) is approximately 0.3420201.

So 2d = 0.564 nm. λ = 0.564 * 0.3420 = 0.1929 nm.

So approximately 0.193 nm. The options don't have this, but the closest is B:0.20. Alternatively, perhaps the d-spacing used in the problem is different. Maybe the problem uses d=0.25 nm? Let me see. If d=0.25, then λ= 2 * 0.25 * sin20 = 0.5 * 0.3420 = 0.171 nm. Hmm, not matching any option either.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the options given. Wait, option J is 0.098 nm. If I plug that in: λ=0.098, d=0.282, theta?

sinθ = (0.098) / (2 * 0.282) ) → 0.098 / 0.564 ≈ 0.1736. What angle is that? Sin(10 degrees) is 0.1736. So theta would be 10 degrees. But the problem says 20 degrees, so that doesn't fit.

Option E is 0.65 nm. Then sinθ = 0.65/(2*0.282) = 0.65/0.564 ≈ 1.152. Wait, that's impossible since sin can't be more than 1. So that's not possible.

Option H is 0.25 nm. So sinθ = 0.25/(2*0.282) = 0.25/0.564 ≈ 0.443, which as before is about 26 degrees, not 20.

Option G is 0.5 nm. Then sinθ = 0.5/(0.564) = ~0.887, which is about 62.5 degrees.

Option B is 0.20 nm. As before, that gives theta around 20.8 degrees, which is close to 20.

Hmm. The calculated value is 0.193 nm, which isn't an option, but the closest option is B:0.20. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if there's a calculation error somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Another thought: perhaps the problem uses a different unit system. Wait, d is in angstroms, not nanometers? No, because the options are in nm.

Wait, 1 angstrom is 0.1 nm. If d was 2.82 angstroms (0.282 nm), that's correct. So no, units are fine.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is in radians? No, 20 radians is way too big, so that's impossible.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the angle given is the angle between the diffracted beam and the crystal surface, which would be complementary to theta. Wait, no, Bragg's law uses theta as the angle between the incoming X-ray and the crystal planes. So if the X-ray is scattered at 20 degrees from the incident direction, that would be the angle between the incident and diffracted beams. So in that case, the angle inside the crystal would be theta = 20/2 =10 degrees. Wait, that's a possibility I didn't consider earlier.

Oh wait, perhaps I got theta wrong. Let me think: in Bragg's Law, theta is the angle between the incoming X-ray and the crystal plane. So when X-rays hit the crystal, they reflect off the planes. The angle between the incident and reflected beam is 2 theta, where theta is the angle each makes with the plane. So if the observed scattering is 20 degrees from the incident direction, that would imply that 2 theta equals 20 degrees. So theta would be 10 degrees. That changes things.

Ah! That's probably where I messed up. I thought theta was 20 degrees, but perhaps it's 10 degrees.

So let me recalculate with theta = 10 degrees.

lambda = 2d sin(theta) = 2 * 0.282 nm * sin(10 degrees).

Sin(10 degrees) is approximately 0.1736.

So 2 * 0.282 = 0.564. 0.564 * 0.1736 ≈ let me compute that.

0.5 * 0.1736 = 0.0868.

0.064 * 0.1736 = approx 0.0111.

Adding them gives 0.0868 + 0.0111 = 0.0979 nm.

So lambda is approximately 0.098 nm. Looking at the options, option J is 0.098 nm. That matches.

But wait, earlier I thought that the angle given was theta, but perhaps it's the angle between incident and diffracted, which is 2 theta. So the correct approach would be to use theta = 10 degrees in Bragg's Law.

So in that case, the wavelength would be about 0.098 nm, which is option J.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use Bragg's Law:

\[
n\lambda = 2d \sin\theta
\]

Here, \( n = 1 \), \( d \) is the interplanar spacing for rock salt (NaCl), and \( \theta \) is the angle between the incident X-rays and the crystal planes. The problem states that the scattered X-rays are observed at an angle of \( 20^\circ \) from the incident direction. This angle corresponds to the angle between the incident and diffracted beams, which means the angle used in Bragg's Law (\( \theta \)) is half of this value, i.e., \( \theta = 10^\circ \).

The interplanar spacing \( d \) for NaCl is approximately \( 0.282 \, \text{nm} \). Substituting these values into Bragg's Law:

\[
\lambda = 2d \sin\theta
\]

\[
\lambda = 2(0.282) \sin(10^\circ)
\]

Using \( \sin(10^\circ) \approx 0.1736 \):

\[
\lambda = 0.564 \times 0.1736 \approx 0.098 \, \text{nm}
\]

This calculated wavelength matches option J (\( 0.098 \, \text{nm} \)).

### Critical Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (0.30 nm):** Too large; would correspond to a much smaller angle than \( 20^\circ \).
- **Option B (0.20 nm):** Close to the calculated value but does not match the exact result.
- **Option C (0.15 nm):** Too small; would correspond to a larger angle than \( 20^\circ \).
- **Option D (1.00 nm):** Far too large; not realistic for X-ray wavelengths.
- **Option E (0.65 nm):** Too large; would correspond to a much smaller angle than \( 20^\circ \).
- **Option F (1.50 nm):** Far too large; not realistic for X-ray wavelengths.
- **Option G (0.50 nm):** Too large; would correspond to a much smaller angle than \( 20^\circ \).
- **Option H (0.25 nm):** Too large; would correspond to a larger angle than \( 20^\circ \).
- **Option I (0.075 nm):** Too small; would correspond to a larger angle than \( 20^\circ \).
- **Option J (0.098 nm):** Matches the calculated value exactly.

Thus, the correct answer is **J: 0.098 nm**.
