Question:

Trace language development during preschool age.

Options:

A: During preschool age, children learn an entirely new language spontaneously without prior exposure.
B: Language development during preschool age involves understanding complex grammatical rules without the ability to apply them in speech.
C: Language development during preschool age is limited to two-word sentences.
D: Preschool children develop the ability to write sentences before they can speak them.
E: Preschool children's language is limited to mimicking sounds without forming coherent words or sentences.
F: During preschool age, children only learn how to perfectly use grammar without developing their vocabulary.
G: During preschool age, children communicate exclusively through non-verbal means and gestures, with no advancement in spoken language.
H: At preschool age, children's vocabulary shrinks before it begins to grow again.
I: Language development regresses during preschool age.
J: During preschool age, the language development of the child progresses beyond the formation of two-word sentences. He begins to form three-word sentences and, from this point on, his language and grammar become more diverse and complex.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about language development in preschool-age children. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking me to trace the language development during that time, and the options are from A to J. I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that preschoolers are usually between 3 to 5 years old. At this stage, their language skills are expanding a lot. I think they start putting together more words than just two. Like, maybe three words or more. So that might relate to one of the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: They learn a new language spontaneously without prior exposure. That doesn't sound right. I mean, kids can pick up languages quickly, but not entirely new ones without any exposure. So probably not A.

Option B: Understanding complex grammar but can't apply them. I'm not sure. I think preschoolers do start applying grammar, maybe not perfectly, but they try. So B might not be correct.

Option C: Limited to two-word sentences. Wait, I thought that's more like the toddler stage, around 2 years old. Preschoolers should be beyond that, so C is probably wrong.

Option D: Develop writing before speaking. No, that's not right. Speaking comes before writing. They start with babbling, then words, then sentences, and much later writing. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Limited to mimicking sounds without coherent words. That's more like infants, not preschoolers. So E is wrong.

Option F: Learn perfect grammar without vocabulary. I don't think so. Vocabulary and grammar develop together. They might not have perfect grammar, but they do add new words. So F is probably wrong.

Option G: Only non-verbal communication. No, preschoolers talk a lot. They use verbal and non-verbal, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Vocabulary shrinks before growing. That doesn't make sense. I think their vocab expands during preschool. So H is wrong.

Option I: Language regresses. No, that's the opposite. Language skills improve, so I is incorrect.

Option J: They form three-word sentences and language becomes more diverse. Yeah, that rings a bell. I remember that around 3 years, kids start using three-word sentences, and their grammar gets better. So J sounds correct.

Wait, but I should think again. Do preschoolers only form three-word sentences, or do they go beyond? I think they do go beyond, using longer sentences with more complexity. So J says they start with three-word sentences and then their language becomes more diverse, which makes sense.

So the correct answer should be J.

The correct answer is J. During the preschool age, children's language development progresses beyond two-word sentences. They begin forming three-word sentences, and their language and grammar become more diverse and complex.
