Okay, so I have this statistics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

So, the problem says there are 10 independent random variables, X₁ to X₁₀. Each X_i is in the range [10, 11], and each has a mean of 10.5. We take the mean of these 10 variables, which is called X_n hat (probably sample mean). The question is about finding the upper bound of the probability that this sample mean is either smaller than 10.2 or larger than 10.8.

Hmm, okay. So the sample mean is (X₁ + X₂ + ... + X₁₀)/10. We need to find P(X_n < 10.2 or X_n > 10.8). And it's asking for the upper bound of this probability.

Wait, upper bound as in the maximum possible probability? So we have to find the highest possible value that this probability can take given the constraints.

Each X_i is between 10 and 11. So each X_i has a range of 1. The mean is 10.5, which is right in the middle. The variables are independent, which probably means their variances add up when considering the variance of the sample mean.

I remember that for the sample mean, the variance is the variance of each X_i divided by n. But since the exact distribution isn't given, maybe we can use Chebyshev's inequality. Chebyshev gives an upper bound on the probability that a random variable deviates from its mean.

Chebyshev's inequality states that for any random variable with mean μ and variance σ², the probability that it deviates from μ by more than k standard deviations is at most 1/k². But wait, Chebyshev applies to the deviation from the mean, so for |X - μ| ≥ kσ, P ≤ 1/k².

But in this case, the sample mean is X_n, which has mean μ = 10.5. The deviations we're looking at are when X_n is less than 10.2 or more than 10.8. So the deviation from the mean is 0.3 on either side.

So the total deviation is 0.3 from the mean. So, the distance kσ would be 0.3. Wait, no, Chebyshev's inequality is about how much the variable deviates, so in terms of standard deviations.

Wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe using the Central Limit Theorem? Since we have the sample mean, but n=10 is not that large, but maybe it's a starting point. However, the problem says "upper bound", so perhaps Chebyshev is the way to go because it gives a bound without knowing the exact distribution.

But Chebyshev requires the variance of X_n. So I need to find the variance of each X_i first.

Each X_i is a random variable in [10,11], with mean 10.5. What's the maximum possible variance it can have? Because the upper bound would be the maximum possible probability, which would correspond to the maximum possible variance, perhaps.

Wait, because if the variance is higher, the probability of X_n deviating more would be higher, right? So to get the upper bound on the probability, I need the maximum possible variance of X_i, given the constraints.

What's the maximum variance for a random variable bounded between a and b? I think it's when the variable takes the extreme values with equal probability. Like, if X_i is 10 or 11 each with probability 0.5, that would maximize the variance.

Let me compute that. For a Bernoulli variable taking a=10 and b=11 with p=0.5 each.

The variance would be E[X²] - (E[X])². E[X] is 10.5, so E[X²] is (10² + 11²)/2 = (100 + 121)/2 = 221/2 = 110.5. So Var(X_i) = 110.5 - (10.5)^2 = 110.5 - 110.25 = 0.25.

So the maximum possible variance for each X_i is 0.25.

Wait, is that correct? Because the maximum variance occurs when the distribution is as spread out as possible. So yeah, putting all the probability at the endpoints maximizes the variance. So that's correct.

So each X_i has variance ≤ 0.25. So the variance of the sample mean X_n, which is the average of 10 independent X_i's, is Var(X_n) = Var(X_i)/10 = 0.25 / 10 = 0.025.

So the standard deviation of X_n is sqrt(0.025) ≈ 0.1581.

Now, the deviation we're interested in is 0.3. So in terms of standard deviations, that's 0.3 / 0.1581 ≈ 1.897.

So k ≈ 1.897.

Chebyshev's inequality says that P(|X_n - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/(k²). But wait, actually, the other way around: for any k > 0, P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k².

Wait, but we have the absolute deviation, so for |X_n -10.5| ≥ 0.3.

But in terms of kσ, 0.3 = kσ, so k = 0.3 / σ.

σ is sqrt(0.025) ≈ 0.1581.

So k = 0.3 / 0.1581 ≈ 1.897.

So the probability P(|X_n -10.5| ≥ 0.3) ≤ 1/(k²) = 1/( (1.897)^2 ) ≈ 1/3.6 ≈ 0.2778.

Wait, but the options don't have 0.2778. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 0.1000

B: 0.3912

C: 0.5999

D: 0.2456

E: 0.2857

F: 0.6731

G: 0.4256

H: 0.1573

I: 0.5123

J: 0.3305

Hmm, 0.2778 isn't exactly an option. But option E is 0.2857, which is approximately 2/7 ≈ 0.2857. Close, but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check the Chebyshev part.

Chebyshev's inequality says P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k². So in our case, the deviation is 0.3, which is equal to kσ. So k is 0.3 / σ.

We found σ² for X_n is 0.025, so σ is sqrt(0.025) = 0.158113883.

So k = 0.3 / 0.158113883 ≈ 1.897.

Then 1/k² = 1/( (1.897)^2 ) ≈ 1/3.6 ≈ 0.2778.

But none of the options exactly match 0.2778. However, option E is 0.2857, which is 2/7. Maybe I should think about another approach.

Wait, wait. Maybe instead of using Chebyshev, I should think about the maximum possible probability using the maximum variance, but perhaps using the exact probability when the variables are at their extreme variances.

Alternatively, perhaps using Hoeffding's inequality? Because Hoeffding applies to bounded variables, which we have here. Each X_i is bounded between 10 and 11, so their mean is bounded.

Hoeffding's inequality states that for independent variables X_i in [a_i, b_i], the probability that the sample mean deviates from the expected mean is bounded by a function involving n, the sample size, and the ranges.

The formula is P( |X̄ - μ| ≥ t ) ≤ 2 exp( -2n² t² / (Σ (b_i - a_i)^2) )

Wait, let me check that formula. Alternatively, Hoeffding's gives that the probability is at most 2 exp( -2n² t² / sum ( (b_i - a_i)^2 ) )

In our case, each X_i is in [10,11], so b_i - a_i = 1 for each. There are 10 variables. So sum ( (b_i -a_i)^2 ) = 10*(1)^2=10.

We want P( |X̄ -10.5| ≥ 0.3 ). So t=0.3.

Plugging into Hoeffding:

P = 2 * exp( -2 * (10)^2 * (0.3)^2 / 10 )

Wait, let me compute the exponent:

-2 * n² * t² / sum ( (b_i -a_i)^2 )

n is 10, so n² is 100.

t is 0.3, t squared is 0.09.

sum is 10.

So the exponent is -2 * 100 * 0.09 / 10 = -2 * 9 = -18.

So P ≤ 2 * exp(-18) ≈ 2 * (about 1.5e-8) ≈ 3e-8, which is a very small number. But that's way smaller than any of the options given, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in applying Hoeffding.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me double-check. 

Hoeffding's inequality for the sum: If X_i are independent and a_i ≤ X_i ≤ b_i, then for any t>0,

P( sum X_i - sum E[X_i] ≥ t ) ≤ exp( -2 t² / sum (b_i - a_i)^2 )

Similarly for the lower side, so combining both,

P( |sum X_i - sum E[X_i]| ≥ t ) ≤ 2 exp( -2 t² / sum (b_i - a_i)^2 )

But the sample mean X̄ is (sum X_i)/n. So to express it in terms of X̄, we can write:

sum X_i = n X̄.

So, sum X_i - sum E[X_i] = n (X̄ - μ).

So,

P( |n (X̄ - μ)| ≥ nt ) ≤ 2 exp( -2 (n t)^2 / sum (b_i -a_i)^2 )

Which can be rewritten as,

P( |X̄ - μ| ≥ t ) ≤ 2 exp( -2 n² t² / sum (b_i -a_i)^2 )

Ah, yes, that's correct. So in our case,

sum (b_i - a_i)^2 = 10*(1)^2 = 10.

n=10, t=0.3.

So, exponent is -2*(10)^2*(0.3)^2 /10 = -2*100*0.09 /10 = -2*9 = -18.

So P ≤ 2 * exp(-18). As I calculated before, that's about 3e-8, which is negligible. But the options are all much larger, like 0.1 or 0.39, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should not use Hoeffding here because the sample size is small and Hoeffding gives a very loose bound in this case. So maybe Chebyshev is better, but the value I got was approximately 0.2778, but the closest option is E:0.2857. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the variance.

Wait a second, perhaps the maximum variance isn't 0.25. Let me think again. For a random variable bounded between a and b with mean μ, the maximum variance is achieved when the variable takes the extreme values a and b with probabilities p and (1-p) such that p a + (1-p) b = μ.

In our case, a=10, b=11, μ=10.5.

So, 10 p + 11 (1-p) = 10.5

10p +11 -11p = 10.5

- p +11 =10.5 → p=0.5.

So that's the case where it's equally likely to be 10 or 11, giving maximum variance. So variance is indeed 0.25.

So that part is correct.

So using Chebyshev, the bound is about 0.2778.

Looking at the options, E is 0.2857, which is about 2/7. 2/7 is approximately 0.2857. Maybe the exact calculation gives us 0.2778, but perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Wait, another thought: the variables are bounded, so their sum is bounded. The minimum possible sum is 10*10=100, maximum is 10*11=110. The sample mean is between 10 and 11.

The event we're considering is when the sample mean is <10.2 or >10.8. So the total deviation from the mean is more than 0.3.

But since each X_i is between 10 and 11, perhaps we can model the sample mean's possible range more tightly.

Wait, the sample mean will have a range from 10 to 11. So 10.2 is 0.2 above 10, and 10.8 is 0.2 below 11.

Wait, but the sample mean's variance is 0.025. So standard deviation is about 0.1581. So 0.3 is about 1.89 sigma.

But perhaps the exact maximum probability can be found using some other inequality. Alternatively, maybe using the maximum possible probability via considering extreme cases.

Wait, another approach: since each X_i is in [10,11], the sample mean is in [10,11]. The maximum probability that the sample mean is outside [10.2,10.8] would occur when the variables are as spread out as possible. But since we're taking the mean, perhaps the worst case is when as many variables as possible are at the extremes.

Wait, but for the maximum probability that the sample mean is <10.2 or >10.8, we need to maximize the probability that the sample mean is outside this interval. So perhaps the case where the variables are as variable as possible, which would be when each X_i is either 10 or 11 with equal probability, as that gives maximum variance.

Wait, but then the sample mean would have a distribution that's approximately normal due to the Central Limit Theorem, but n=10 is small, so maybe not. But using the maximum variance case, the Chebyshev bound I calculated earlier was around 0.2778.

But the options don't have exactly that. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact probability when each X_i is Bernoulli at 10 and 11, then compute the exact probability for the sample mean being outside 10.2–10.8.

So let me think: if each X_i is 10 or 11 with p=0.5, then the sum S = X₁ + ... + X₁₀ is a binomial variable with parameters n=10 and p=0.5, scaled by 1 (the difference from 10). Wait, more accurately, each X_i is 10 + Y_i, where Y_i is 0 or 1 with p=0.5.

So the sum S = 10*10 + sum Y_i = 100 + sum Y_i.

sum Y_i is a Binomial(10, 0.5) variable.

The sample mean X̄ = (100 + sum Y_i)/10 = 10 + (sum Y_i)/10.

We want P(X̄ <10.2 or X̄>10.8) = P( (sum Y_i)/10 <0.2 or (sum Y_i)/10 >0.8 ) = P( sum Y_i <2 or sum Y_i >8 ).

Since sum Y_i is integer counts, sum Y_i can be from 0 to 10.

So P( sum Y_i ≤1 or sum Y_i ≥9 ).

So compute P(sum Y_i ≤1) + P(sum Y_i ≥9).

Since the distribution is symmetric (because p=0.5), P(sum Y_i ≤1) = P(sum Y_i ≥9).

So each is equal, so total probability is 2 * P(sum Y_i ≤1).

Compute P(sum Y_i=0) + P(sum Y_i=1) = (10 choose 0) (0.5)^10 + (10 choose 1)(0.5)^10 = 1 +10 / 1024 = 11/1024 ≈0.0107421875.

So total probability is 2 * (11/1024) = 22/1024 = 11/512 ≈0.021484375.

Wait, that's about 2.14%, which is much lower than the Chebyshev bound I found earlier. But that's the exact probability when the variables are at maximum variance. So why is this much lower than the Chebyshev bound?

Hmm, because Chebyshev gives an upper bound, but the exact probability could be much lower. But the question is about the upper bound, so perhaps Chebyshev is the correct approach here because it gives a maximum possible probability across all possible distributions, not just the Bernoulli case.

Wait, but in the Bernoulli case, the probability is 0.0215, which is much lower than 0.2778. So perhaps the Chebyshev bound is not tight, and the actual upper bound is lower. But the question is about the upper bound, so the maximum possible probability across all possible distributions of X_i meeting the given constraints.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the maximum variance occurs when X_i is Bernoulli, but maybe that's not the case for the sample mean's probability outside the interval.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum probability occurs when the variables are constant. Wait, if each X_i is a constant 10.5, then the sample mean is always 10.5, so the probability of being outside [10.2,10.8] is zero. That would give the minimum probability. But we're looking for the maximum, so the case where the variables have maximum variance.

Wait, but in the Bernoulli case, the sample mean's variance is maximum, but the actual probability P(X_n outside [10.2,10.8]) is 0.0215. But Chebyshev gave a higher upper bound of ~0.2778. So the question is, which one is the correct upper bound?

Wait, the problem is asking for the upper bound of the probability, so the maximum possible
