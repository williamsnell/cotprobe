Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about evaluating a triple integral of the divergence of a vector field over a spherical volume. Let me break it down.

First, the problem states that vector A is given in spherical coordinates as kr^n r̂. So A is a vector field where the magnitude depends on r (the radial distance) as kr^n and it's directed radially outward because it's along r̂.

The integral we're supposed to compute is the triple integral over volume v of the divergence of A. Mathematically, that's ∫∫∫_v (∇ · A) dV. And the volume v is a sphere of radius a centered at the origin.

I remember that one of the theorems in vector calculus is the Divergence Theorem, which relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface enclosing the volume. But wait, the Divergence Theorem is about the flux through the surface, which would be a double integral, whereas here the problem is asking for a triple integral of the divergence. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm confusing something. Oh wait, no, the Divergence Theorem connects ∫∫∫_v (div A) dV to ∫∫_S (A · n̂) dS, where S is the surface of v. So in this problem, since v is a sphere, S would be the sphere of radius a.

But wait, the question is just to compute the triple integral of div A, which is the left side of the Divergence Theorem. Alternatively, maybe using the theorem could simplify the calculation, but perhaps it's easier to directly compute the divergence in spherical coordinates and then integrate.

Let me think about computing the divergence of A in spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field is given by:

div A = (1/r²) ∂(r² A_r)/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(A_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/r sinθ) ∂A_φ/∂φ

But in this case, the vector field A has components only in the r direction, right? So A_r = kr^n, and A_θ = 0, A_φ = 0.

So substituting into the expression for divergence:

div A = (1/r²) ∂(r² * kr^n)/∂r + 0 + 0

Let's compute that derivative. The term inside is r² * kr^n = k r^{n+2}.

Taking the derivative with respect to r: d/dr (k r^{n+2}) = k (n+2) r^{n+1}.

So putting it back, div A = (1/r²) * k (n+2) r^{n+1} = k (n+2) r^{n-1}.

Wait, let me check that again. Because r² * kr^n is kr^{n+2}, yes. The derivative of that with respect to r is (n+2) kr^{n+1}. Then, when multiplied by 1/r², it's (n+2)k r^{n+1}/r² = (n+2)k r^{n-1}.

So div A = k (n+2) r^{n-1}.

Now, the integral becomes the triple integral over the sphere of radius a of k (n+2) r^{n-1} dV.

Since the integrand only depends on r, and the volume element in spherical coordinates is dV = r² sinθ dr dθ dφ, the integral simplifies because of spherical symmetry. So the integral over θ and φ will just give the surface area of the sphere, and then we can integrate over r from 0 to a.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The integrand is k(n+2) r^{n-1}, so the integral over the sphere would be:

Integral = ∫ (from r=0 to a) [k(n+2) r^{n-1}] * [r² ∫ (θ=0 to π) sinθ dθ ∫ (φ=0 to 2π) dφ ] dr

Because the volume element is r² sinθ dr dθ dφ. So the angular parts integrate to 4π, since ∫ sinθ dθ from 0 to π is 2, and ∫ dφ from 0 to 2π is 2π, so 2 * 2π = 4π.

So the integral becomes:

k(n+2) * 4π ∫ (r=0 to a) r^{n-1} * r² dr

Wait, because I have r^{n-1} from the divergence, and r² from the volume element. So r^{n-1} * r² = r^{n+1}.

So the integral is k(n+2) *4π ∫ (0 to a) r^{n+1} dr.

Integrating r^{n+1} from 0 to a gives [r^{n+2}/(n+2)] from 0 to a, which is a^{n+2}/(n+2).

So putting it all together:

Integral = k(n+2) *4π * (a^{n+2}/(n+2)) )

The (n+2) terms cancel out, leaving 4π k a^{n+2}.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 4πk a^{n+2} as an option. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:4π k a^{n+2}

Wait, no, let me look again.

Wait, the options list:

A:4π k a^{n+2}

Wait, but looking at the user's options, option A is 4π k a^{n+2}? Wait, no, in the user's message, the options are:

Option A: 4π k a^{n+2}? Wait, no, let me check.

Wait, the user wrote:

Options:

A: 4\pi k a^n+2 → which is 4πk a^{n+2}

Yes. So according to my calculation, the integral is 4πk a^{n+2}, which matches option A.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check my steps because sometimes when you think you're done, you realize you missed something.

Wait, the divergence step: I computed div A correctly? Let's recheck.

A = kr^n r̂, so A_r = kr^n, A_θ = A_φ = 0.

Div A in spherical coords is (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r) + other terms which are zero.

So d/dr (r² * kr^n) = d/dr (kr^{n+2}) = k(n+2) r^{n+1}.

So (1/r²) times that is k(n+2) r^{n-1}.

Yes, that's correct.

Then the integral becomes ∫ (div A) dV = ∫ (k(n+2) r^{n-1}) * (r² sinθ dr dθ dφ) )

Which simplifies to k(n+2) ∫∫∫ r^{n+1} sinθ dr dθ dφ.

The angular integrals give 4π, as before, so the integral is 4π k (n+2) ∫0^a r^{n+1} dr.

Which is 4π k (n+2) [a^{n+2}/(n+2)] ) = 4π k a^{n+2}.

So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, some of them have a^{n} times factors. So option A is 4πk a^{n+2}, which is what I have. So the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, another thought: the problem says to compute the integral of div A over the volume, which is exactly what I did. So why would the Divergence Theorem not be necessary here? Because the Divergence Theorem equates the volume integral of div A to the flux of A through the surface S. So alternatively, I could compute the flux of A through the sphere of radius a and get the same result.

Let me try that approach to confirm.

The flux is ∫∫_S A · n̂ dS. Since the sphere is of radius a, and A is radial, A = kr^n r̂, and n̂ is r̂ on the surface. So A · n̂ = kr^n.

The surface element on a sphere of radius a is dS = a² sinθ dθ dφ.

So the flux integral becomes ∫ (θ=0 to π) ∫ (φ=0 to 2π) kr^n * a² sinθ dφ dθ.

But wait, since A is kr^n, and on the sphere r=a, so A · n̂ = k a^n.

So the integral becomes k a^n * a² ∫ sinθ dθ dφ.

The integral over φ is 2π, and over θ is 2, so total surface integral is k a^n * a² * 4π.

Which is 4π k a^{n+2}, same as before.

So both methods give the same result, which is option A.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

Option A: 4π k a^{n+2}

So that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I compute the volume integral correctly? Let me think: in the triple integral, I used r from 0 to a, and the integrand as r^{n+1}.

Yes, because r^{n-1} * r² = r^{n+1}.

Wait, but wait, in the divergence, I have r^{n-1}, and in the volume element, r² sinθ, so when combining, it's r^{n+1}.

Yes, so the integral over r is ∫0^a r^{n+1} dr = a^{n+2}/(n+2).

But when multiplied by k (n+2) and 4π, the (n+2) cancels, leaving 4π k a^{n+2}.

So yes, everything checks out. So the correct answer must be option A.

To evaluate the integral \(\iiint_v (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}) \, dV\), where \(\mathbf{A} = kr^n \hat{r}\) in spherical coordinates and \(v\) is a sphere of radius \(a\) centered at the origin, we proceed as follows:

1. **Compute the divergence of \(\mathbf{A}\):**  
   In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field with only a radial component \(\mathbf{A} = A_r \hat{r}\) is given by:  
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2 A_r).
   \]  
   Substituting \(A_r = kr^n\), we find:  
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2 kr^n) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} (kr^{n+2}) = \frac{1}{r^2} k(n+2)r^{n+1} = k(n+2)r^{n-1}.
   \]

2. **Set up the integral in spherical coordinates:**  
   The volume element in spherical coordinates is \(dV = r^2 \sin\theta \, dr \, d\theta \, d\phi\). Since the integrand \(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}\) depends only on \(r\), the angular integrals can be factored out. The integral becomes:  
   \[
   \iiint_v (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}) \, dV = \int_0^a \int_0^\pi \int_0^{2\pi} k(n+2)r^{n-1} r^2 \sin\theta \, d\phi \, d\theta \, dr.
   \]  
   Simplifying, this is:  
   \[
   k(n+2) \int_0^a r^{n+1} \, dr \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi.
   \]

3. **Evaluate the angular integrals:**  
   The angular integrals are:  
   \[
   \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi = 2\pi, \quad \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta = 2.
   \]  
   Thus, the angular factor contributes \(2\pi \cdot 2 = 4\pi\).

4. **Evaluate the radial integral:**  
   The radial integral is:  
   \[
   \int_0^a r^{n+1} \, dr = \left[\frac{r^{n+2}}{n+2}\right]_0^a = \frac{a^{n+2}}{n+2}.
   \]

5. **Combine all terms:**  
   Substituting back, the integral becomes:  
   \[
   k(n+2) \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{a^{n+2}}{n+2} = 4\pi k a^{n+2}.
   \]

6. **Verify using the Divergence Theorem:**  
   The Divergence Theorem states that:  
   \[
   \iiint_v (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}) \, dV = \iint_S (\mathbf{A} \cdot \hat{n}) \, dS,
   \]  
   where \(S\) is the surface of the sphere. On the sphere of radius \(a\), \(\mathbf{A} \cdot \hat{n} = k a^n\), and the surface element is \(dS = a^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi\). The surface integral is:  
   \[
   \iint_S (\mathbf{A} \cdot \hat{n}) \, dS = \int_0^\pi \int_0^{2\pi} k a^n a^2 \sin\theta \, d\phi \, d\theta = k a^n a^2 \cdot 4\pi = 4\pi k a^{n+2}.
   \]  
   This confirms the result.

Thus, the value of the integral is \(4\pi k a^{n+2}\), which corresponds to **option A**.
