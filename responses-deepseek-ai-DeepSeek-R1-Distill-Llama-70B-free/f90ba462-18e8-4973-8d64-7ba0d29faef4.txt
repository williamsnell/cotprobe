Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about calculating the work needed for a person to climb a certain distance on the Moon. Alright, I remember that work done against gravity is related to the change in gravitational potential energy. So the formula I think I need is Work = mgh, where m is mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height climbed.

Wait, but let me make sure. The problem states that the person is climbing on the Moon's surface, so I should use the Moon's gravity, right. The Moon's g is given as 1.60 m/s². Got it.

The person's mass is 65 kg, and the height they're climbing is 4.0 meters. Oh wait, mass is in kg, gravity in m/s², height in meters. So plugging into the formula should give me the work in joules.

So let me calculate this. m is 65 kg, g is 1.60, h is 4.0 m. So 65 multiplied by 1.60 is... Let me do that first. 65 * 1.6. Hmm, 60*1.6 is 96, and 5*1.6 is 8, so total is 104. Then multiply by 4.0? Because h is 4.0 m. So 104 *4 is 416. So work done is 416 joules.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 416. Let me check the options again. A is 3.8e2, which is 380. B is 1.04e3, which is 1040. C is 600, D is 420, E is 320, F is 960, G is 800, H is 520, I is 780, J is 260.

Hmm. Wait, I got 416 J. None of the options exactly match that. Oh wait, option D is 4.2e2, which is 420 J. That's pretty close. Could I have made a calculation error?

Let me recalculate. 65 kg * 1.60 m/s² = 104 N (that's the weight). Then 104 N * 4 m = 416 J. So 416 isn't an option. Wait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the question correctly. The question says "work needed to climb through 4.0 m". So that's the height, right. So why isn't 416 one of the options?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me try again. 65 * 1.6 = 104, correct. 104 *4 is 416. So that's 4.16e2 J, which would round to 4.2e2 J. Oh, so option D is 4.2e2, which is 420. So maybe the question expects us to round to two significant figures?

Wait, what's the given data? The mass is 65 kg (two significant figures), the height is 4.0 m (two as well), and g is 1.60 m/s² (three sig figs). So when multiplying, the least number of sig figs is two. So the answer should have two sig figs. So 416 J would be 4.2e2 J when rounded to two sig figs. So 420 J, which is option D.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, the Moon's surface gravity is 1.625 m/s², but the question gives it as 1.60 m/s². So we have to use that value.

So, the calculation is correct, and the closest option is D: 4.2e2 J.

To calculate the work needed for a $65 \mathrm{~kg}$ person to climb $4.0 \mathrm{~m}$ on the Moon, we use the formula for work done against gravity:

\[
W = mgh
\]

Where:
- $m = 65 \mathrm{~kg}$ (mass of the person),
- $g = 1.60 \mathrm{~m/s^2}$ (acceleration due to gravity on the Moon),
- $h = 4.0 \mathrm{~m}$ (height climbed).

First, calculate the weight of the person:

\[
65 \times 1.60 = 104 \mathrm{~N}
\]

Then, calculate the work done:

\[
104 \times 4.0 = 416 \mathrm{~J}
\]

The options provided do not include $416 \mathrm{~J}$ exactly, but option D corresponds to $4.2 \times 10^2 \mathrm{~J}$, which is $420 \mathrm{~J}$. Since the given data (mass, height, and gravity) have two significant figures, the final answer should also be rounded to two significant figures. Thus, $416 \mathrm{~J}$ rounds to $420 \mathrm{~J}$, making option D the correct choice.

Answer: D
