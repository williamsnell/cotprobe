Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Internal-External Control Scale, also known as the locus of control. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Internal-External Control Scale measures a person's belief about whether their life is controlled by internal factors (like their own efforts) or external factors (like luck or other people). So, if someone scores high on internal, they believe their actions affect their outcomes, while high externals think outside forces are more in control.

The question is about sex and race differences on this scale. I think there have been studies showing some differences, but I'm not sure exactly what. Let me try to recall.

From what I remember, men tend to be more internal than women. That makes sense because societal roles might encourage men to take more control, or maybe it's a stereotype that they're more assertive. So, men would believe more in internal control.

Now, for race differences, I think African Americans might tend to have a more external locus of control. But why? Maybe due to systemic issues or historical factors where they've had less control over their environment. So, perhaps Blacks are more external than Whites.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the sex differences. I think some studies found that women are more external, but others say the opposite. Or maybe it's more about specific situations. Alternatively, I've heard that in some contexts, women might feel less control, so they'd be more external. But I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, I think the consensus is that men are more internal, women more external. So, women would have higher external scores. So, for the sex part, women are more external than men, and for race, Blacks are more external than Whites.

Looking at the options:

Option C says "Women are more external than men and blacks are more external than whites." That fits with what I was thinking. So, that would be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. I'm a bit uncertain because I might be mixing up the findings. Alternatively, maybe it's the opposite. I think another angle is that when people experience more discrimination or systemic barriers, they might feel their efforts don't matter as much, leading to a more external locus. So, that would support Blacks being more external.

So, the correct answer should be option C: Women are more external than men and blacks are more external than whites.

Wait, but wait another thought. I've read somewhere that some studies found no significant differences, but others found these. So perhaps I should check each option again.

Looking through the options:

Option E: No sex difference, but Blacks more external. So that's possible, but I thought there was a sex difference.

Option C: Women more external, Blacks more external. That's what I thought.

Option I: Men more internal, Blacks more internal. No, that doesn't fit.

Option F: Women more internal, Whites more internal. No, I thought the opposite.

So, I think the correct answer is option C.

The Internal-External Control Scale measures an individual's belief in whether their outcomes are controlled by internal factors (e.g., personal effort) or external factors (e.g., luck or others). When examining sex and race differences, research suggests that men tend to score higher on internal control, believing their actions significantly impact their outcomes, while women often score higher on external control, perceiving more influence from external factors.

Regarding race, studies indicate that African Americans may tend toward a more external locus of control compared to Whites, potentially due to systemic or historical factors that have limited their perceived control over life circumstances. This aligns with the idea that experiences of discrimination or systemic barriers can foster a stronger belief in external control.

Given these findings, the correct answer is that women are more external than men, and Blacks are more external than Whites.
