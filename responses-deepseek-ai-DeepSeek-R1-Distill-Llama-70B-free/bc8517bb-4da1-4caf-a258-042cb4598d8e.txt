Okay, so I've got this question here about the normal human chromosome diploid number. Hmm, I remember that diploid means two sets of chromosomes, right? Humans are diploid organisms, which means each cell has two copies of each chromosome—one from each parent.

I think the human genome has 23 pairs of chromosomes. So 23 pairs would make 46 chromosomes in total. That's the diploid number because diploid is having two sets. So 46 is the diploid number, which is option H.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing this up. I recall that gametes, like sperm and egg cells, are haploid, which means they have half the number—so 23 chromosomes. That makes sense because when they combine during fertilization, they form a diploid cell with 46. So yes, the diploid number is 46.

Looking at the options again, option H is 46. So the answer should be H.

The normal human chromosome diploid number is 46, which corresponds to 23 pairs of chromosomes. This is the total number of chromosomes in most human cells. 

Answer: H
