Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the probability of getting exactly 2 heads and 1 tail when tossing a penny three times. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with probabilities of multiple events, especially with something like coin tosses, each toss is an independent event. Each toss has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T), each with a probability of 1/2.

So the problem is asking for the probability of exactly two heads and one tail in three tosses. I think I need to consider all the possible sequences that meet this condition. Let me think about the different ways this can happen.

Each toss is independent, so the total number of possible outcomes when tossing a penny three times is 2^3, which is 8. Let me list them out to be sure:

1. HHH
2. HHT
3. HTH
4. HTT
5. THH
6. THT
7. TTH
8. TTT

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me recount. For three tosses, each position can be H or T. So the number of possible outcomes is indeed 2*2*2 = 8. The correct list should include all combinations:

1. HHH
2. HHT
3. HTH
4. HTT
5. THH
6. THT
7. TTH
8. TTT

Okay, that's 8. Now, how many of these have exactly 2 heads and 1 tail? Let me look through the list.

Looking at each outcome:

1. HHH: 3 heads, 0 tails. Doesn't fit.
2. HHT: 2 heads, 1 tail. Yes.
3. HTH: 2 heads, 1 tail. Yes.
4. HTT: 1 head, 2 tails. No.
5. THH: 2 heads, 1 tail. Yes.
6. THT: 1 head, 2 tails. No.
7. TTH: 1 head, 2 tails. No.
8. TTT: 0 heads, 3 tails. No.

So the favorable outcomes are HHT, HTH, and THH. That's 3 outcomes where there are exactly two heads and one tail.

So the number of favorable outcomes is 3, and the total possible outcomes are 8. So the probability would be 3/8.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach is using combinations. The number of ways to choose 2 successes (heads) out of 3 trials is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = n!/(k!(n -k)!).

So here, n=3 and k=2. So C(3,2) = 3!/(2!1!) = (6)/(2*1) )=3. So there are 3 favorable combinations. Each of these has a probability of (1/2)^3 = 1/8. So 3 * (1/8) = 3/8.

Yes, that's the same answer as before.

So the probability is 3/8. Looking at the options, option H is 3/8. So the correct answer should be H.

To determine the probability of getting exactly 2 heads and 1 tail when a penny is tossed 3 times, we first calculate the total number of possible outcomes. Since each toss has 2 possible results (heads or tails), the total number of outcomes is \( 2^3 = 8 \).

Next, we identify the favorable outcomes that meet the condition of exactly 2 heads and 1 tail. These are:
1. HHT
2. HTH
3. THH

There are 3 favorable outcomes. The probability is then calculated as the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{8}.
\]

Thus, the probability of getting exactly 2 heads and 1 tail is \( \frac{3}{8} \), which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
