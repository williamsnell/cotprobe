Okay, I need to solve this differential equation using Laplace transforms. The equation is y' - y = e^(-x), and the initial condition is y(0) = 0. Hmm, I remember that Laplace transforms are useful for solving linear differential equations with constant coefficients.

First, I should take the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation. The derivative property says that L{y'} = sY(s) - y(0), where Y(s) is the Laplace transform of y(t). Since y(0) is 0, that term drops out. So L{y'} is just sY(s).

The equation becomes sY(s) - L{y} = L{e^(-x)}. Wait, but L{y} is Y(s), so the left side is sY(s) - Y(s). On the right side, the Laplace transform of e^(-x) is 1/(s+1), right? Because I remember that L{e^(at)} = 1/(s - a), and here a is -1.

So putting it together: (sY(s) - Y(s)) = 1/(s + 1). Let's factor Y(s) out. Y(s)(s - 1) = 1/(s + 1). So Y(s) = [1/(s + 1)] / (s - 1). Which simplifies to 1/[(s - 1)(s + 1)].

Wait, that looks like a fraction that can be broken into partial fractions. Let me do that. Let's see, 1/[(s-1)(s+1)] = A/(s-1) + B/(s+1). To find A and B, I'll multiply both sides by (s-1)(s+1), getting 1 = A(s+1) + B(s-1).

Setting up to solve for A and B. Let me choose s=1: 1 = A(2) + B(0) → A = 1/2. Similarly, set s = -1: 1 = A(0) + B(-2) → B = -1/2.

So Y(s) = (1/2)/(s - 1) - (1/2)/(s + 1). Now I need to take the inverse Laplace transform of each term. The inverse of 1/(s - a) is e^(at), right?

So the inverse of (1/2)/(s-1) is (1/2) e^t, and the inverse of -(1/2)/(s+1) is -(1/2)e^(-t). Putting it together, y(t) = (1/2)e^t - (1/2)e^(-t).

Wait, that looks familiar. That's the definition of sinh(t), but let me check the options. Option A is sinh x, and option F is (1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^-x. Wait, isn't sinh x equal to (e^x - e^-x)/2? So y(x) would be (e^x - e^-x)/2, which is exactly option F. Alternatively, if I factor it, that's sinh x, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is (1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^-x, which is the same as (e^x - e^-x)/2, which is sinh x. So is option A correct or option F? Because y(x) would be either sinh x or expressed as the exponential terms.

Looking at the options again. Option A says sinh x, and option F is (1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^-x. So they're the same. Wait, but let me think. The question asks for the solution, and the options include both forms. So which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me double-check the steps. Taking the Laplace transform of y' - y = e^{-x}, with y(0)=0.

L{y'} is sY(s), L{y} is Y(s), so sY(s) - Y(s) = 1/(s+1). So (s-1)Y(s) = 1/(s+1) → Y(s) = 1/[ (s-1)(s+1) ].

Partial fractions correctly done: A=1/2, B=-1/2. So Y(s) = [1/(2(s-1))] - [1/(2(s+1))].

Inverse Laplace gives (1/2) e^t - (1/2) e^{-t}, which is indeed sinh(t). So that's option A. Alternatively, option F is the same thing written out.

Wait, looking back at the options: Option A is sinh x, and option F is (1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^-x. So both are correct. But the question is to select the correct answer from the options. Are both options present?

Wait, looking again, the options are from A to J. Let's list them:

A: sinh x
B: e^x - e^-x
C: e^x +x
D: x² e^x
E: cosh x
F: (1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^-x
G: x e^x
H: e^-x
I: (1/2)e^x + (1/2)e^-x
J: e^x

So both A and F are correct expressions for the solution. But the question is which one is an option. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because when I took the inverse Laplace, I should have considered that the original equation was in terms of x, not t. But in the problem, the variable is x, not t. Oh, wait, that's a good point. So the Laplace transform is for functions of t, but here the variable is x. So perhaps I should have used t instead of x in the equations.

Wait, that might be confusing. Let's clarify. In the problem, the variable is x, so the function is y(x). So when taking Laplace transforms, the variable becomes s, and the function is expressed in terms of x. So perhaps when I did the inverse Laplace, I should have e^{a x}, not e^{a t}.

So redoing the inverse step: Y(s) = (1/2)/(s - 1) - (1/2)/(s + 1). The inverse Laplace of 1/(s - a) is e^{a x}, so the inverse would be (1/2)e^{x} - (1/2)e^{-x}.

So that would be y(x) = (e^x - e^{-x})/2, which is sinh(x). So that's option A.

Wait, but option F is (1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^-x, which is the same as sinh x. So both options A and F are equivalent. But in the options, both are present. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Wait, the original equation is y' - y = e^{-x}. Let me consider if I applied the Laplace transform correctly. So L{y'} = sY(s) - y(0) = sY(s). L{y} = Y(s). L{e^{-x}} is 1/(s + 1). So the equation becomes sY(s) - Y(s) = 1/(s + 1). So (s - 1)Y(s) = 1/(s + 1). Y(s) = 1/[(s - 1)(s + 1)].

Yes, that's correct. Partial fractions as before. So the inverse is (1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^{-x}.

Looking back, option F is exactly that. So why is option A present as sinh x? Because sinh x is (e^x - e^{-x})/2, which is the same as option F. So both A and F are correct. But the options only list each once.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the problem statement. The question asks to use the derivative property of Laplace transforms. Did I do that correctly?

Yes, I used L{y'} = sY(s) - y(0), which is correct. So the solution is y(x) = (e^x - e^{-x})/2, which is sinh x. So option A and F both represent this function. But looking at the options, both A and F are present.

Wait, but the options are A through J, each unique. So perhaps in the options, sinh x is option A and the exponential form is option F. So which one should I choose?

The problem says to select the correct option. Since both A and F are correct, but perhaps only one of them is among the options. Wait, no, both are options.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again. Let me recompute the partial fractions.

1/[(s-1)(s+1)] = A/(s-1) + B/(s+1). Multiply both sides by (s-1)(s+1): 1 = A(s+1) + B(s-1).

To find A, set s=1: 1 = A(2) → A=1/2.

To find B, set s=-1: 1 = B(-2) → B= -1/2.

So Y(s) = (1/2)/(s-1) - (1/2)/(s+1). So inverse is (1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^{-x}.

Which is option F. So the correct answer would be F, because it's the explicit form. But option A is the same function expressed as sinh x.

Wait, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of hyperbolic functions. Then option A would be correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether any of the steps could have led me to another option.

Wait, another approach: solving the differential equation without Laplace transforms. The equation is y' - y = e^{-x}, y(0)=0.

This is a linear first-order equation. The integrating factor is e^{∫-1 dx} = e^{-x}. Multiply both sides by e^{-x}:

e^{-x} y' - e^{-x} y = 1.

The left side is the derivative of (y e^{-x} ). So integrate both sides:

∫ d(y e^{-x}) = ∫ 1 dx → y e^{-x} = x + C.

Apply initial condition y(0)=0: 0 * e^{0} = 0 = 0 + C → C=0.

So y = x e^{x}.

Wait, that can't be right because when I solved using Laplace transforms, I got sinh x. Oh wait, this can't be. Wait, no, that must mean I made a mistake in the integrating factor approach.

Wait, wait. Let's redo the integrating factor method. The equation is y' + P(x) y = Q(x). Wait, no, the given equation is y' - y = e^{-x}, so P(x) = -1, Q(x) = e^{-x}.

So integrating factor μ(x) = e^{∫ P(x) dx} = e^{∫-1 dx} = e^{-x}.

Multiply equation by μ(x):

e^{-x} y' - e^{-x} y = e^{-x} * e^{-x} = e^{-2x}.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait, the equation is y' - y = e^{-x}. Multiply each term by e^{-x}:

e^{-x} y' - e^{-x} y = e^{-2x}.

The left-hand side is the derivative of (y e^{-x} ), so:

d/dx (y e^{-x}) = e^{-2x}.

Integrate both sides:

y e^{-x} = ∫ e^{-2x} dx + C.

Integral of e^{-2x} is (-1/2) e^{-2x} + C.

So y e^{-x} = (-1/2) e^{-2x} + C.

Multiply both sides by e^{x}:

y = (-1/2) e^{-x} + C e^{x}.

Apply initial condition y(0)=0:

0 = (-1/2) e^{0} + C e^{0} → 0 = -1/2 + C → C = 1/2.

Thus, y = (1/2) e^{x} - (1/2) e^{-x}.

Which is the same as sinh x, and matches option F.

So I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought I got y = x e^x, but that's not possible. So the correct solution is y = (e^x - e^{-x})/2, which is option F.

Wait, but earlier when I used Laplace transforms, I also got that result. So why did I think when I did the integrating factor method I got a different answer? Oh wait, no, in the integrating factor approach, I correctly arrived at the same solution.

So the correct answer is option F, which is (1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^-x, or equivalently sinh x (option A). But since the options include both, which one is correct?

Wait, looking back at the problem, the Laplace transform approach leads to option F. But the integrating factor method leads to the same. So the answer should be either A or F. But the options are separate.

But wait, in the Laplace transform method, the solution is (1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^-x, which is option F, which is the same as sinh x (option A). So both are correct. But I can only choose one option.

Looking at the problem statement again, I think the correct answer is option F because that's the explicit solution from the Laplace transform, but option A is also correct. However, perhaps the provided options don't have both. Wait, the options do have both.

Wait, but the user provided the options, and both A and F are possible. I need to choose the correct one. Let me see what the standard solution looks like.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Laplace transform approach. Let me double-check.

Taking Laplace of y' - y = e^{-x}:

(s Y(s) - y(0)) ) - Y(s) = 1/(s +1).

Since y(0) = 0, this becomes (s - 1) Y(s) = 1/(s +1).

So Y(s) = 1/[(s -1)(s +1)].

Partial fractions: [A/(s-1)] + [B/(s+1)].

Solve for A and B: A = 1/2, B = -1/2.

Inverse Laplace gives (1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^{-x}, which is option F.

So the correct answer is option F.

To solve the differential equation \( y' - y = e^{-x} \) with the initial condition \( y(0) = 0 \) using Laplace transforms, we proceed as follows:

1. **Take the Laplace transform of both sides**:  
   Using the derivative property of Laplace transforms, \( \mathcal{L}\{y'\} = sY(s) - y(0) \), and since \( y(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( \mathcal{L}\{y'\} = sY(s) \). The Laplace transform of \( e^{-x} \) is \( \frac{1}{s+1} \). The equation becomes:  
   \[
   sY(s) - Y(s) = \frac{1}{s+1}.
   \]

2. **Simplify and solve for \( Y(s) \)**:  
   Factoring \( Y(s) \) out, we get:  
   \[
   (s - 1)Y(s) = \frac{1}{s+1}.
   \]  
   Solving for \( Y(s) \):  
   \[
   Y(s) = \frac{1}{(s - 1)(s + 1)}.
   \]

3. **Partial fraction decomposition**:  
   Decompose \( Y(s) \) into simpler fractions:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{(s - 1)(s + 1)} = \frac{A}{s - 1} + \frac{B}{s + 1}.
   \]  
   Solving for \( A \) and \( B \), we find \( A = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( B = -\frac{1}{2} \). Thus:  
   \[
   Y(s) = \frac{1}{2(s - 1)} - \frac{1}{2(s + 1)}.
   \]

4. **Take the inverse Laplace transform**:  
   The inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{s - 1} \) is \( e^x \), and the inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{s + 1} \) is \( e^{-x} \). Therefore:  
   \[
   y(x) = \frac{1}{2}e^x - \frac{1}{2}e^{-x}.
   \]

5. **Compare with the options**:  
   The solution \( y(x) = \frac{1}{2}e^x - \frac{1}{2}e^{-x} \) matches **option F**. This can also be expressed as \( \sinh(x) \), which corresponds to **option A**. However, since the problem explicitly asks for the solution in the form derived from the Laplace transform, the correct answer is **option F**.
