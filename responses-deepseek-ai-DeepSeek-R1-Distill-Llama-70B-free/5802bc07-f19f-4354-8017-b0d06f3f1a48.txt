Okay, so I have this question here about a friend's statement and which psychological concept it illustrates. Let me try to break it down.

The friend says, "Every time I plan a vacation, there's always a crisis at home or work so that I can't go." The question states that this isn't really true, so it's not an accurate observation. I need to figure out which cognitive bias or error this exemplifies.

First, I'll go through each option and see which one fits. Let's start by recalling what each term means.

Option A: Illusory correlation. That's when someone perceives a relationship between two events that isn't actually there. Like thinking that wearing a certain jersey brings good luck. So if the friend thinks planning a vacation causes crises, even though it's coincidental, that might fit.

Option B: Base rate fallacy. This is ignoring general statistical information in favor of specific, more vivid info. For example, thinking you're more likely to die in a plane crash than a car because plane crashes are more dramatic. Not sure how that applies here.

Option C: Cognitive dissonance. That's when someone holds conflicting thoughts and feels discomfort, leading to a change in belief. The friend isn't showing conflicting thoughts, just a statement about events.

Option D: Anchoring bias. Relying too much on the first piece of information encountered. Doesn't seem relevant here.

Option E: Availability heuristic. Judging likelihood based on how easily examples come to mind. Like thinking plane crashes are common because they're memorable. If the friend overestimates the frequency because a few instances are vivid, this could apply.

Option F: Fundamental attribution bias. Overemphasizing personal traits and underestimating situational factors. Not directly relevant to the friend's situation.

Option G: Hindsight bias. Believing, after an event, that it was predictable. Not quite the case here.

Option H: Self-serving bias. Attributing successes to oneself and failures to external factors. Doesn't seem to fit.

Option I: Psychological reactance. Reacting negatively when freedom is restricted. Not applicable.

Option J: Confirmation bias. Favoring information that confirms preexisting beliefs. Maybe, but the friend is making a general statement rather than selectively seeking info.

So, the friend is noticing a pattern where planning a vacation is followed by a crisis, implying a causal relationship. But the question says it's not true. So they're perceiving a correlation that doesn't exist. That sounds like illusory correlation (A) or perhaps availability heuristic (E).

Wait, let me think again. Availability heuristic is more about judging the likelihood based on how easily examples come to mind. If the friend has had a couple of instances where vacation plans were ruined, they might overestimate how common this is, thinking it's a pattern (availability), or they might think there's a connection between planning and crises when there isn't (illusory correlation).

So which one is it? The statement is about every time they plan, a crisis happens. It's a perceived cause-effect. So they're associating two events (planning vacation and crisis) that aren't actually related. That's more about seeing a correlation that's not real, which is illusory correlation.

Alternatively, availability would be if they think crises are more common when planning because a few instances are memorable. But the friend is stating it happens every time, which is more about perceiving a consistent relationship, not just frequency.

So I think the answer is A: illusory correlation.
</think>

The friend's statement illustrates a scenario where they perceive a consistent relationship between planning a vacation and a crisis occurring, even though this relationship isn't actually true. This fits the concept of **illusory correlation**, where someone perceives a connection between two events that isn't supported by evidence. The friend is not overestimating the frequency of crises based on vivid memories (which would align with the availability heuristic) but is instead falsely attributing a causal or correlational relationship between planning a vacation and crises. 

Answer: A
