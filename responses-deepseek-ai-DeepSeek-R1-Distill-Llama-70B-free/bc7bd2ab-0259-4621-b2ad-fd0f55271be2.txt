Question:

A woman was seven months pregnant with her first child. One afternoon, the woman was in the kitchen of her home preparing a snack when she glanced out the window and saw a horrible crime being committed. The woman watched in horror as a local gang member pulled out a handgun and used it to shoot the victim, a member of a rival gang. The gang member did not know anyone was witnessing his act of shooting the victim. The woman watched as the victim collapsed and fell dead on her neighbor's front lawn. As a result of her shock from viewing this horrible incident, the woman suffered a miscarriage. If the woman asserts a claim against the local gang member who shot the victim, the woman will

Options:

A: recover, because she suffered a physical injury, rather than just emotional harm.
B: not recover, because the gang member was unaware that the woman was watching.
C: not recover, because the woman was not the intended target of the gang member's act.
D: not recover, because the woman voluntarily assumed the risk by watching the crime.
E: not recover, because the miscarriage cannot be directly linked to the gang member's act.
F: recover, because the gang member acted intentionally in shooting the victim.
G: not recover, because the woman was not within the zone of danger.
H: recover, because the gang member's act was a direct cause of her miscarriage.
I: recover, because the gang member's act was unlawful and caused harm.

Okay, so I have this legal question here about tort law, specifically negligence or intentional infliction of emotional distress. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is a woman who's seven months pregnant. She's in her kitchen, sees a crime happening outside—some gang member shoots someone else. She watches in horror, and because of the shock, she miscarries. Now, she's suing the gang member. The question is whether she can recover damages.

I remember that in torts, when a person causes physical harm, sometimes bystanders can recover for emotional distress, but the rules are strict. I think about the case where you have to be in the zone of danger or have a close relationship with the victim. Wait, but in this case, the woman isn't the one being shot; she's just a witness.

So, the gang member shot a rival gang member, and the woman saw it. The gang member didn't know she was watching. The woman's miscarriage is a physical injury resulting from the emotional trauma of witnessing the crime.

I think the key here is whether a bystander can recover for emotional distress caused by witnessing an intentional tort. I remember that for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the plaintiff usually needs to be the target. But here, the woman wasn't the target; the victim was.

Wait, but there's also the concept of negligence. If the defendant's action was so reckless that it caused emotional distress leading to physical harm, maybe she can claim negligence. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of bystander liability under some rule.

Wait, another thought: some jurisdictions allow recovery for emotional distress if the plaintiff was in the zone of danger. Like, if you're in the area where harm could come to you, and because of that danger, you suffer emotional distress. But in this case, the woman was inside her kitchen, watching through a window. The gang member didn't know she was there, so she wasn't in immediate danger. So she wasn't in the zone of danger.

So if she's not in the zone of danger, then under the traditional rule, she can't recover for emotional distress unless she's a bystander with a close relationship to the victim. But here, the victim is a rival gang member, so she's probably not closely related to him. So that wouldn't apply.

But wait, the woman did suffer a physical injury—the miscarriage. So the question is, does the physical injury make it recoverable?

In some cases, courts have allowed recovery when the emotional distress results in physical harm. But I think that's more in cases where the plaintiff was in the zone of danger or had a close relationship, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

Another angle: the gang member's act was intentional—he intended to shoot the victim. So, could the woman argue that his intentional act caused her miscarriage, making him liable? I'm not sure. Intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) requires that the defendant's conduct was outrageous, intended to cause severe emotional distress, and actually caused it. But here, the defendant didn't intend to cause distress to the woman; he didn't even know she was there. So IIED might not apply because the intent wasn't directed at her.

So maybe the claim would be under negligence. The defendant's reckless conduct caused her emotional distress leading to physical harm. But I think for negligence, even if the distress leads to physical harm, the plaintiff usually needs to be within a foreseeable zone of danger or have a close relationship.

In the case of the woman not being in the zone of danger, and no close relationship to the victim, perhaps she can't recover. Because even though she had a physical injury, the cause was the emotional distress from an event she wasn't directly part of.

Wait, but some courts have held that a bystander can recover if they are physically injured as a result of the emotional distress, regardless of the zone of danger. But I'm not sure how that's applied. Maybe that's a more modern approach.

Looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A: She can recover because she suffered physical injury, not just emotional harm. Hmm, so maybe physical injury makes it recoverable. But I thought that without being in the zone or a close relationship, even with physical injury, it's not recoverable. So A might be incorrect.

Option B: She can't recover because the gang member didn't know she was watching. I'm not sure that's the main issue. The issue is more about whether she's in the zone of danger or a bystander with a close relationship. So B might not be the right reason.

Option C: She can't recover because she wasn't the intended target. That's probably correct because for IIED, intent to cause distress is needed, and here the intent was to shoot the victim, not to distress her.

Option D: She assumed the risk by watching. No, that doesn't make sense. Watching a crime isn't assuming the risk of the perpetrator's actions.

Option E: Miscarriage can't be linked. But the question says it was a result, so E is incorrect.

Option F: She can recover because the act was intentional. But intentionality alone doesn't make it recoverable if the intent wasn't towards her. So F might not be correct.

Option G: She wasn't in the zone of danger. So if that's the requirement, then she can't recover. But some jurisdictions might allow it if there's physical harm. So G might be the answer.

Option H: She can recover because the act was a direct cause. But causation isn't the only issue; duty and foreseeability matter. So H might not be sufficient.

Option I: She can recover because the act was unlawful and caused harm. But unlawfulness alone doesn't automatically mean liability without considering whether the duty was owed to her.

So, considering all this, I think the correct answer is either C or G. Because she wasn't the target, and she wasn't in the zone of danger.

Wait, the options. Let me read again. Option C says she wasn't the intended target. Option G says she wasn't in the zone of danger.

I think the main reason is that she wasn't in the zone of danger. Because even if she had a physical injury, if she wasn't in the zone, she can't recover for the emotional distress leading to the injury. So the answer would be G.

But wait, some cases might allow recovery if the bystander suffers a physical injury, regardless of the zone. I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the Dillon v. Legg case. In California, after Dillon, bystanders can recover even if not in the zone of danger if they have a close relationship with the victim and are present at the scene. But in this case, the woman doesn't have a close relationship with the victim (a rival gang member), so that exception wouldn't apply.

So without being in the zone or a close relationship, she can't recover. So the answer is G.

The question revolves around whether the woman can recover damages from the gang member who caused her to witness a shooting, leading to her miscarriage due to emotional distress. The key issues are whether the woman was in the "zone of danger," her relationship to the victim, and the nature of the gang member's intent.

1. **Option A**: The woman suffered physical injury (miscarriage), but under tort law, physical harm resulting from emotional distress generally requires the plaintiff to be in the "zone of danger" or have a close relationship with the victim. Since the woman was not in the zone of danger, this option is unlikely to succeed.

2. **Option B**: The gang member's lack of awareness of the woman's presence is not the determining factor. The issue is more about the woman's proximity to the danger or her relationship to the victim, making this option incorrect.

3. **Option C**: The woman was not the intended target of the gang member's act. However, the critical factor is not whether she was the target, but whether she was in the zone of danger or had a close relationship with the victim. Thus, this option is not the best explanation.

4. **Option D**: The woman did not assume the risk by watching the crime. Assumption of risk applies in different contexts, such as voluntary participation in dangerous activities, which is not relevant here. This option is incorrect.

5. **Option E**: The miscarriage was explicitly linked to the woman's shock from witnessing the crime, so this option is factually incorrect.

6. **Option F**: While the gang member's act was intentional, intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) requires the defendant's conduct to be directed at the plaintiff or to cause severe emotional distress. Since the gang member did not intend to harm the woman, this option is incorrect.

7. **Option G**: The woman was not in the zone of danger. Under traditional tort law, bystanders can only recover for emotional distress if they are in the zone of danger or have a close relationship with the victim. Since the woman was inside her kitchen and not in immediate danger, this is the most accurate explanation for why she cannot recover.

8. **Option H**: While the gang member's act was a direct cause of the miscarriage, causation alone is insufficient. The plaintiff must also establish that the defendant owed her a duty of care, which is not present here. This option is incomplete.

9. **Option I**: The act was unlawful and caused harm, but unlawfulness alone does not establish liability without a duty of care. This option is incorrect.

The correct answer is **G**, as the woman was not in the zone of danger, and without a close relationship to the victim, she cannot recover damages under the given circumstances.
