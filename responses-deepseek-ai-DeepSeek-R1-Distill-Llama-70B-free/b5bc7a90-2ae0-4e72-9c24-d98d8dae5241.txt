Question:

200 Kg of water at T_i = 35°C is kept in an auxiliary reservoir tobe heated by solar energy. The solar collector used has a surfacearea of A = 5m^2.

Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the efficiency of a solar heating system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The setup: There's 200 kg of water at an initial temperature of 35°C. It's being heated by a solar collector with an area of 5 m². The heat removal factor is 0.8, and the overall heat transfer coefficient U_L is 8.0 W/m².°C. Ambient temperature is 30°C. The product UA is 1.8 W/°C. During an emergency, water is used at 15 kg/hr and refilled at 20°C. We need to find the efficiency from 7 am to 5 pm using the provided tables.

Wait, the question is about the efficiency. From what I remember, efficiency in solar systems is usually the ratio of the useful heat collected to the incoming solar radiation. So, efficiency η is (useful heat Q) divided by (incident radiation I_T) over the same period.

Looking at the tables provided: Table 1 has columns for I_T, S, T_a, U_L(T_i - T_a), q, and η. Oh, but in the description, it says that the sum of I_T is 20.51 and sum of q is 8.59. So the day's efficiency would be 8.59 / 20.51, which is approximately 0.42, or 42%.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The options include 42% as option C. But I should check if there's more to it. Oh, wait, another table (Table 2) is provided which seems to detail the hourly loads and losses. But the question specifically refers to the efficiency from 7 am to 5 pm, which is 10 hours. The initial calculation using the sums from Table 1 gives 42%, which is option C.

But wait, does the refill of water affect the efficiency? The water is used at 15 kg/hr and refilled at 20°C. I don't think that affects the collection efficiency because that's about the system's operation during the day when it's charging, not discharging. The efficiency here is about how well the solar collector is capturing the sun's energy, not about the storage or usage during emergency.

So the correct approach is to take the sum of q (useful energy collected) divided by the sum of I_T (incident energy), which is 8.59 / 20.42 (wait, the sum I_T in the table is 20.51, but the user's example says 20.42—maybe a typo, but either way, it's around 42%).

So the answer should be 42%, which is option C.

The problem involves determining the efficiency of a solar heating system operating from 7 am to 5 pm. The efficiency is defined as the ratio of the useful heat collected (\( \sum q \)) to the total incident solar radiation (\( \sum I_T \)) over the same period. 

From the data provided in Table 1:
- The total useful heat collected (\( \sum q \)) is 8.59 MJ.
- The total incident solar radiation (\( \sum I_T \)) is approximately 20.51 MJ.

The efficiency is calculated as:

\[
\eta_{\text{day}} = \frac{\sum q}{\sum I_T} = \frac{8.59}{20.51} \approx 0.42 \, \text{or} \, 42\%.
\]

The refill and usage of water during the emergency do not affect the collection efficiency, as the efficiency is solely based on the solar collector's performance in capturing incident radiation. Therefore, the correct answer is **42%**, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
