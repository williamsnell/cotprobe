Okay, so I have this problem here about stock prices, and I need to figure out what the price is at the end of Friday. Let me think through this step by step.

The initial price at the beginning of the week is $24.75. Then, each day from Monday to Friday, the stock either gains or loses a certain amount. I guess I need to add or subtract each day's change to the current price and see what I end up with on Friday.

So let me list out each day's change:

- Monday: gain of $2.50
- Tuesday: loss of $3.25
- Wednesday: loss of $0.75
- Thursday: gain of $1.25
- Friday: gain of $4.75

I think the easiest way is to start with the initial price and apply each day's change in order.

Starting with $24.75.

Monday: $24.75 + $2.50 = $27.25.

Then Tuesday: $27.25 - $3.25. Hmm, subtracting 3.25. Let me do the math: 27.25 minus 3 is 24.25, then minus 0.25 more is 24.00. So Tuesday ends at $24.00.

Wednesday: $24.00 - $0.75 = $23.25.

Thursday: $23.25 + $1.25 = $24.50.

Friday: $24.50 + $4.75. Let me add that. 24.50 + 4 is 28.50, plus 0.75 is 29.25.

So the final price should be $29.25. Now I look back at the options. Option C is $29.25, so I think that's the answer.

Wait, did I do all the steps correctly? Let me double-check each day.

Monday: 24.75 + 2.50 = 27.25. Correct.

Tuesday: 27.25 -3.25. 27.25 minus 3 is 24.25, minus 0.25 is 24. Correct.

Wednesday: 24 - 0.75 = 23.25. Yep.

Thursday: 23.25 +1.25 = 24.5. Right.

Friday: 24.5 +4.75. Let's see, 24.5 +4 is 28.5, plus 0.75 is 29.25. Definitely, that's correct.

So the answer should be option C.

The price of the stock at the end of Friday is calculated by starting with the initial price of $24.75 and applying each day's changes in sequence:

- **Monday**: $24.75 + $2.50 = $27.25  
- **Tuesday**: $27.25 - $3.25 = $24.00  
- **Wednesday**: $24.00 - $0.75 = $23.25  
- **Thursday**: $23.25 + $1.25 = $24.50  
- **Friday**: $24.50 + $4.75 = $29.25  

Thus, the final price at the end of Friday is **$29.25**, which corresponds to option **C**.
