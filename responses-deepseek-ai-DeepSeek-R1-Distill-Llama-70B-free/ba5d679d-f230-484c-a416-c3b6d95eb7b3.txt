Okay, so I have this problem about a reciprocating refrigeration compressor, and I'm supposed to find the volumetric efficiency. The options are given from A to J, so I need to calculate it step by step.

Let me first list the given data to make sure I don't miss anything. The refrigerant is Freon-12. The gas enters at 20 lbf/in² and 60°F, and it's compressed to 180 lbf/in². The compressor is a single cylinder with a bore of 2.0 inches, a stroke of 2.5 inches, and it's running at 1800 rpm. The mass flow rate is 2.5 lbm/min. I need to find the volumetric efficiency.

Hmm, volumetric efficiency is the ratio of the actual volume of gas drawn into the cylinder to the displacement volume. So I think the formula is η_vol = (actual volume)/(displacement volume). But wait, I might need to relate the mass flow rate to the volumes somehow.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by first finding the theoretical (or displacement) volume and then the actual volume based on the mass flow rate. Because the mass flow rate would be related to the actual volume of gas being sucked in.

So first, calculating the displacement volume. Displacement volume is the volume swept by the piston. For a reciprocating compressor, the displacement volume per cycle is V_d = L * A, where L is the stroke length and A is the cross-sectional area of the cylinder (based on the bore). Since it's a single cylinder, each cycle (two strokes: intake and compression) would displace this volume once per revolution.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, each revolution of the crankshaft corresponds to one complete cycle (intake and compression). So for each revolution, the displacement volume is swept once. So the displacement rate would be displacement volume multiplied by rpm.

Let me compute that. The bore is 2.0 inches. The area A is π*(bore/2)^2. So radius is 1 inch, area is π*(1)^2 = π ≈ 3.1416 square inches. The stroke is 2.5 inches. So the displacement volume per revolution is V_d = L * A = 2.5 * 3.1416 ≈ 7.854 in³ per revolution.

Now, since the rpm is 1800, the displacement rate (in in³/min) would be 7.854 * 1800 ≈ 14,137 in³/min. Wait, no, wait: 7.854 in³ per revolution times 1800 revolutions per minute gives 14,137.2 in³/min. But wait, that's per minute, but what about units? Let me make sure.

Wait, but we might need to convert units for everything to be consistent. Since the pressure is in lbf/in², which is psi, and the mass flow rate is in lbm/min, perhaps using imperial units is okay, but I'll have to be careful with gas constant units.

Wait, actually, maybe I should compute the actual volume using the mass flow rate. The mass flow rate is 2.5 lbm/min. So I can find the actual volume per minute that's being drawn in, and then compare it to the displacement volume to find the efficiency.

Wait, the mass flow rate is related to the density and the volume flow rate. So m_dot = ρ * V_dot. So V_dot = m_dot / ρ. But I need to find the density at the inlet conditions.

The inlet conditions are 20 psi and 60°F. I need to find the specific volume or the density of Freon-12 at these conditions. Alternatively, I can use the ideal gas law, but wait, Freon-12 is a refrigerant and at those conditions, it's probably a vapor, but not sure if ideal gas applies. But maybe for this problem, they expect us to use the ideal gas law.

Wait, the ideal gas equation is PV = nRT, but since we're dealing with mass, maybe it's better to write it in terms of specific volume. The specific gas constant R for Freon-12 would be needed. Alternatively, I can find the density from the ideal gas law.

Wait, I think I remember that the gas constant R for Freon-12 is 14.56 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R). Let me confirm that. Wait, no, I think that's for something else. Alternatively, maybe I should look up the specific gas constant for Freon-12. Wait, but perhaps I should proceed with the problem assuming ideal gas.

So at the inlet, P1 is 20 psi, T1 is 60°F, which is (460 + 60) = 520 °R. The specific gas constant R for Freon-12 is... Hmm, I might have to calculate it from the molecular weight. The molecular weight (M) of Freon-12 is about 120.92 g/mol. So the universal gas constant R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·°R). So specific gas constant r = R/M.

Wait, M is lbmol? So R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·°R). M is 120.92 g/mol, but wait, 1 lbmol is about 454 moles (since 1 lbm is 454 grams). So M is 120.92 g/mol, so 120.92 /454 ≈ 0.266 lbmol per lbm.

Wait, I think I'm complicating things. Alternatively, R for Freon-12 is often given as 14.9 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the ideal gas equation in terms of specific volume.

Wait, let me think again. The density ρ is mass per unit volume. So from ideal gas, PV = mRT, where m is mass, so P = (m/V) * R * T. So ρ = m/V = P/(R*T).

So R here is specific gas constant in units of psi·ft³/(lbm·°R). So I need R for Freon-12. I think I remember that R for Freon-12 is approximately 14.56 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R), but wait, the units might be off because when using psi, perhaps it's better to have R in psi·ft³/(lbm·°R).

Wait, but 1 ft·lbf is equivalent to 12 in·lbf, so maybe I can convert the units. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for R in terms of psi and cubic feet.

Wait, maybe I should find R in [psi·ft³/(lbm·R)] units. Let me see: the universal gas constant R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). So for Freon-12, the molecular weight is about 120.92 g/mol, which is 120.92 / 454.59 ≈ 0.266 lbmol per lbm. So the specific gas constant r = R / M = 10.7316 / 0.266 ≈ 40.35 psi·ft³/(lbm·R). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me compute that again. M is molar mass in lbmol per lbm. So M = 120.92 g/mol / 454.59 g/lbmol ≈ 0.266 lbmol/lbm.

So R_specific = R_universal / M = 10.7316 / 0.266 ≈ 40.35 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R).

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake. The universal gas constant R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). So if M is 120.92 g/mol, then 1 lbmol is 454.59 g, so 120.92 g is 120.92 / 454.59 = 0.266 lbmol. So R_specific = R_universal / M_in_lbmol_per_lbm. So R_specific = 10.7316 / 0.266 ≈ 40.35 psi·ft³/(lbm·R).

So now, at the inlet conditions, P = 20 psi, T = 520 R.

Density ρ = P/(R_specific * T) = 20 / (40.35 * 520).

Let me compute that: 40.35 * 520 ≈ 20,982. So 20 / 20,982 ≈ 0.000953 lbm/ft³.

Wait, that seems low. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should use R = 14.56 ft·lbf/(lbm·R) but then I have to convert units to psi and ft³.

Wait, 1 ft·lbf = 12 in·lbf, but that might not be directly helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of specific volume, which is the inverse of density. Specific volume v = V/m = R_specific * T / P.

So v = (40.35 psi·ft³/(lbm·R)) * 520 R / 20 psi.

Let me compute that: 40.35 * 520 = 20,982; 20,982 /20 = 1,049.1 ft³/lbm.

Wait, that's specific volume. So 1,049.1 ft³ per lbm. So density is 1/1,049.1 ≈ 0.000953 lbm/ft³, which matches my previous calculation.

Wait, but 1,000 ft³ is a big volume, so seems low. But maybe it's correct because at low pressure (20 psi), the gas is less dense.

Now, the mass flow rate is 2.5 lbm/min. So the volume flow rate V_dot = m_dot / ρ = 2.5 / 0.000953 ≈ 2622.3 lbm/min * ft³/lbm → 2622.3 ft³/min.

Wait, wait, no: m_dot is 2.5 lbm/min. So V_dot = 2.5 lbm/min / 0.000953 lbm/ft³ → 2.5 / 0.000953 ≈ 2622.3 ft³/min.

Wait, that seems really high. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 2.5 divided by 0.000953: 2.5 / 0.000953. Let me compute this. 0.000953 is approx 9.53e-4. So 2.5 / 9.53e-4 ≈ 2.5 / 0.000953 ≈ 2622.3 ft³/min. Hmm, maybe that's correct. So the actual volume flow rate is about 2622 ft³/min.

Now, the displacement volume per minute is 14,137 in³/min. Wait, but that's in cubic inches, and the actual volume is in cubic feet. So I need to convert units.

1 ft³ is 12 in x 12 in x 12 in = 1728 in³. So 2622.3 ft³/min = 2622.3 * 1728 in³/min ≈ 4,534,488 in³/min.

Wait, no, wait: I think I'm confusing something. The actual volume flow rate is 2622.3 ft³/min, and the displacement is 14,137 in³/min. To compare, I need both in the same units.

So let's convert displacement volume to ft³/min. Since 1 ft³ is 1728 in³, the displacement is 14,137 in³/min = 14,137 / 1728 ≈ 8.182 ft³/min.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because 14,137 in³ is about 8.18 ft³, so per minute, it's 8.18 ft³/min. But the actual volume is 2622.3 ft³/min. That would suggest the compressor is moving way more than its displacement, which doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, wait. The displacement volume per revolution is V_d = 7.854 in³, as calculated earlier. So per minute, at 1800 rpm, it's 7.854 * 1800 = 14,137.2 in³/min. Now, converting to ft³: 14,137.2 / 1728 ≈ 8.18 ft³/min.

But the actual volume flow rate is 2622 ft³/min. So that would imply that the compressor is moving 2622 ft³/min, but the displacement is only 8.18 ft³/min. That would make the volumetric efficiency 8.18 / 2622 * 100%, which is way less than 1%, which can't be right. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the actual and displacement. Volumetric efficiency is (actual volume)/(displacement volume). Wait, no, wait: volumetric efficiency η_vol is (swept volume) / (displacement volume), but wait, no, volumetric efficiency is the ratio of the actual mass of gas drawn in to the mass if the cylinder were filled at inlet conditions. So perhaps I should compute the actual volume as the mass flow rate divided by the inlet density, then compare that to the displacement volume.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass flow rate calculation. Let me think again.

The mass flow rate is 2.5 lbm/min. The specific volume at inlet is v = 1,049.1 ft³/lbm. So the volume flow rate is m_dot * v = 2.5 lbm/min * 1,049.1 ft³/lbm = 2622.8 ft³/min. So that's correct.

But the displacement volume per minute is 14,137 in³/min, which is 8.18 ft³/min. So the actual volume is 2622.8 ft³/min, displacement is 8.18 ft³/min, so the ratio is 8.18 / 2622.8 ≈ 0.00312, which is 0.312%, which is way too low. That can't be right because the options are around 60-70%.

So I must have messed up somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the units when calculating the displacement volume. Because the displacement volume per revolution is in in³, but perhaps I forgot to account for something else.

Wait, the bore is 2 inches, so radius is 1 inch. Area A = π*(1)^2 = π in². Stroke is 2.5 inches. So displacement per revolution is A * stroke = π * 2.5 ≈ 7.854 in³ per revolution.

At 1800 rpm, the displacement per minute is 7.854 * 1800 = 14,137 in³/min.

Wait, but wait, 1 revolution is one complete cycle, which includes both suction and compression. So the displacement volume per revolution is the volume of air sucked in during suction stroke, right? So that's correct. So per minute, it's 14,137 in³/min, which is about 8.18 ft³/min.

But the actual volume is 2622.8 ft³/min. That would mean η_vol is (8.18 / 2622.8)*100% ≈ 0.31%, which is way too low. That can't be right, so I must have made a mistake in the calculation of the actual volume.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units when using the ideal gas law. Let me try to compute the specific volume again.

I think I made a mistake in the specific gas constant. Let me try to find R for Freon-12 correctly.

The molecular weight of Freon-12 (CCl2F2) is: C is 12, Cl is 35.45, F is 19. So 12 + 2*35.45 + 2*19 = 12 +70.9 +38 = 120.9 g/mol.

So the molar mass M is 120.9 g/mol, which is 120.9 / 454.59 ≈ 0.266 lbmol/lbm.

The universal gas constant R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R).

So specific gas constant r = R / M = 10.7316 / 0.266 ≈ 40.35 psi·ft³/(lbm·R).

So at P = 20 psi, T = 520 R, the specific volume v is v = r*T/P = (40.35 * 520) / 20.

Compute numerator: 40.35 * 520 = 20,982. So 20,982 /20 = 1,049.1 ft³/lbm. So that's correct.

So mass flow rate m_dot = 2.5 lbm/min.

Volume flow rate V_dot = m_dot * v = 2.5 * 1,049.1 ≈ 2622.8 ft³/min.

Wait, but that's per minute. The displacement is 8.18 ft³/min. So V_dot is way higher than displacement. So η_vol is V_dot_actual / V_dot_displacement? No, wait, volumetric efficiency is (actual volume sucked in) / (displacement volume). So if the actual volume is higher than displacement, η_vol can't be more than 100%, but in this case, it's way higher, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concepts here. Wait, volumetric efficiency is usually less than 100% because of losses, so if actual is less than displacement, η_vol is less than 100. But in this case, the actual volume is way higher. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the concept.

Wait, no, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Volumetric efficiency is the ratio of mass flow to the mass flow if the cylinder was 100% efficient. So it's (actual mass flow)/(theoretical mass flow). The theoretical mass flow is displacement volume * density.

Wait, yes, maybe I should compute it that way. So theoretical mass flow would be displacement volume rate multiplied by density.

So m_dot_theoretical = V_dot_displacement * ρ.

V_dot_displacement is 14,137 in³/min. Let's convert that to ft³: 14,137 / 1728 ≈ 8.18 ft³/min.

Density ρ is 0.000953 lbm/ft³. So m_dot_theoretical = 8.18 * 0.000953 ≈ 0.00779 lbm/min.

Wait, but the actual m_dot is 2.5 lbm/min, which is way higher. So that would imply η_vol is (2.5)/(0.00779) ≈ 321, which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be. So
