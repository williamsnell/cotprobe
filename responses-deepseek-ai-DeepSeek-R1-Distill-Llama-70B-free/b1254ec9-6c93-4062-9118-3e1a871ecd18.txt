Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether traits change with age. So, the question is asking if personality traits or other characteristics evolve as a person gets older. Hmm, I remember from psychology class that there are different theories about this.

Wait, I think there's something about personality being relatively stable, especially after a certain age. Like, the Big Five traits—openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism—tend to stabilize in adulthood. So maybe traits don't change a lot as people get older.

But then again, I've heard that some traits do change. For example, people might become more conscientious as they take on more responsibilities, like jobs and families. Or maybe they become more agreeable as they mature. But does that mean traits change a lot or just a little?

Oh, right, there's the idea that personality can change, but it's usually gradual and not drastic. So maybe traits do change, but only slightly as people age. Also, major life events can influence changes, but the question is about age in general, not just events.

Looking at the options, option A says they change a little, which aligns with the idea that while there's some change, it's not massive. Option G says no, they don't change, but I think that's too absolute because some changes do happen. Option I says they change quite a lot, but I'm not sure that's accurate for most people.

So, considering all this, I think the answer is that traits do change a little with age.

The answer is based on the understanding that while personality traits are generally stable, they can change slightly with age due to maturation and life experiences.
