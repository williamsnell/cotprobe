Okay, so I have this problem about propane burning in air, and I need to find the dew point and mole fractions of the combustion products. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the reaction is given: C3H8 + 5O2 + 18.8N2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O + 18.8N2. Wait, so the N2 is a spectator here, right? It doesn't take part in the reaction. So the products are CO2, H2O, and leftover N2, I suppose. Also, there's excess O2 because the air is 125% theoretical. Oh right, because if it's 125% of the theoretical air, then there's 25% more O2 than needed. So some O2 will remain in the products.

First, I think I need to calculate the mole fractions of each product. Let's start by figuring out the moles of each reactant and product.

The stoichiometric (theoretical) air would have 5 moles of O2. But since it's 125% of that, the actual O2 is 5 * 1.25 = 6.25 moles. Wait, no, wait. The problem says 125% theoretical air, so the air is 1.25 times the stoichiometric amount. So, for every mole of propane, the stoichiometric is 5 O2. So 1.25 times that would be 6.25 O2, right. And since air is 21% O2 and 79% N2, I can find how much N2 is involved.

Wait, let me clarify: The air supplied is 1.25 times the stoichiometric. So for each mole of C3H8, the stoichiometric O2 is 5 moles. So the air is 1.25 * (5 moles O2 / 0.21) because air is 21% O2. Oh wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's see.

Wait, actually, the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio would involve the O2 needed. So for each mole of C3H8, we need 5 moles O2. But air has 21% O2, so to get 5 moles O2, we need 5 / 0.21 ≈ 23.81 moles of air. But since it's 125% theoretical air, we have 1.25 * 23.81 ≈ 29.76 moles of air. So that's the total air supplied.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me write the combustion reaction with 125% theoretical air.

The given reaction is C3H8 + 5O2 + 18.8N2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O + 18.8N2. Wait, hold on. The coefficients here: the O2 is 5 moles, N2 is 18.8. But that's probably scaled for each mole of propane. Wait, maybe 18.8 N2 is 5*(79/21)*something. Let me think. Or perhaps the given equation already accounts for the 125% air.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me start by balancing the combustion reaction with 125% theoretical air.

Propane (C3H8) combustion reaction is:

C3H8 + O2 → CO2 + H2O.

The stoichiometric equation is:

C3H8 + 5 O2 → 3 CO2 + 4 H2O.

But since the air is 125% of theoretical, that means 25% excess air. So the O2 supplied is 5 * 1.25 = 6.25 moles. Wait, no: wait, 125% of the theoretical air. So for each mole of propane, the stoichiometric O2 is 5 moles, so 125% would be 6.25 moles O2. But the air is 21% O2, so the moles of air supplied would be (6.25) / 0.21. But maybe that's complicating things, perhaps I should approach it using the given reaction.

Wait, the given reaction in the problem statement is: C3H8 + 5O2 + 18.8N2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O + 18.8N2. Hmm, so perhaps the N2 comes from the air. Since the air is 21% O2 and 79% N2, the moles of N2 would be (moles of O2) * (79/21). So in this case, the O2 is 5 moles, so N2 would be 5*(79/21) = approximately 18.8 moles. So that makes sense. So the given reaction is for stoichiometric air, perhaps.

But wait, the problem states it's 125% theoretical air. So I think the given reaction may not account for the excess O2. So maybe I should adjust the O2 and N2 accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the combustion equation with excess air. Let me try that.

So, for 1 mole of C3H8:

The stoichiometric O2 required is 5 moles. But 125% of that is 6.25 moles. So the O2 supplied is 6.25 moles.

The air is 21% O2 and 79% N2, so the moles of N2 supplied are (6.25) * (79/21) = let's calculate that.

6.25 * (79/21) = (6.25 *79) /21 ≈ (493.75)/21 ≈ 23.51 moles N2.

So the combustion reaction with excess air would be:

C3H8 + 6.25 O2 + 23.51 N2 → 3 CO2 + 4 H2O + (6.25 - 5) O2 + 23.51 N2.

Wait, because the O2 is in excess. So the O2 consumed is 5 moles (stoichiometric), so the excess is 1.25 moles O2.

So the products would be:

3 CO2, 4 H2O, 1.25 O2, and 23.51 N2.

Wait, but the given reaction in the problem already includes N2 as 18.8, which seems to be for stoichiometric conditions. So perhaps the given reaction is for 100% theoretical air, and I'm supposed to adjust it to 125% air.

Wait, let me sum up the moles correctly.

So, for 1 mole of C3H8:

O2 required stoichiometric: 5 moles.

Air is 21% O2, so to get 5 moles O2, we need 5/0.21 ≈ 23.8095 moles of air. So N2 is 23.8095 * 0.79 ≈ 18.8 moles. That's why the given reaction has 18.8 N2. But that's for 100% air. Now, the problem uses 125% air, so the O2 is 5 *1.25=6.25 moles, and N2 is 6.25*(79/21) = 23.51 moles, as I calculated earlier.

So the reaction becomes:

C3H8 + 6.25 O2 + 23.51 N2 → 3 CO2 +4 H2O + (6.25 -5) O2 +23.51 N2.

So the O2 in products is 1.25 moles, and N2 is 23.51.

So the total moles in products: 3 +4 +1.25 +23.51 = 3+4=7; 7+1.25=8.25; 8.25+23.51=31.76 moles.

Wait, let me compute that accurately:

3 CO2 → 3 moles.

4 H2O →4.

1.25 O2 →1.25.

23.51 N2 →23.51.

Total: 3+4=7; 7+1.25=8.25; 8.25+23.51=31.76 moles.

Now, let's compute the mole fractions of each component in the products.

Mole fraction of CO2: 3 /31.76 ≈ 0.0945.

H2O:4/31.76 ≈0.126.

O2:1.25/31.76≈0.03935.

N2:23.51/31.76≈0.7402.

So CO2 is about 0.0945, H2O 0.126, O2 0.03935, N2 0.7402.

Wait, let me check: 3+4+1.25+23.51 = sum to 31.76? 3+4 is 7, plus 1.25 is 8.25, plus 23.51 is 31.76, yes.

So the mole fractions are approximately:

CO2: 0.0945 → ~9.45%.

H2O: 0.126 → ~12.6%.

O2: ~3.935%.

N2: ~74.02%.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option B: CO2 0.094, H2O 0.126, O2 0.04, N2 0.74. That's very close.

Option E: CO2 0.088, H2O 0.132, O2 0.035, N2 0.745.

Option J: CO2 0.095, H2O 0.125, O2 0.045, N2 0.735.

Hmm, B is 0.094 CO2, 0.126 H2O, 0.04 O2, 0.74 N2. Our calculated values are 0.0945 CO2, 0.126 H2O, 0.03935 O2, 0.7402 N2. So that's a perfect match with option B.

Wait, but what about the dew point? Because the options also include dew point.

The dew point is the temperature at which the water vapor in the products will start to condense. To find the dew point, I think we need to calculate the partial pressure of H2O in the products and then find the saturation temperature for that pressure.

Wait, the total pressure is 1 atm, as given. So the partial pressure of H2O is its mole fraction times total pressure. So, P_H2O = X_H2O * P_total = 0.126 *1 atm ≈ 0.126 atm.

Now, we can use the steam tables or the Antoine equation to find the temperature at which the vapor pressure of water equals 0.126 atm.

I think the Antoine equation is a good approach. The Antoine equation is:

log10(P) = A - (B)/(T + C)

Where P is in bar, and T is in Kelvin.

The constants for water are:

A = 8.14019

B = 1810.94

C = 244.485

So, let's convert 0.126 atm to bar. 1 atm = 1.01325 bar, so 0.126 atm = 0.126 *1.01325 ≈ 0.1277 bar.

Wait, no. Wait, 1 bar is approximately 0.9869 atm. So to convert 0.126 atm to bar: 0.126 / 0.9869 ≈ 0.1277 bar.

So P = 0.1277 bar.

Now, plug into the Antoine equation:

log10(0.1277) = A - (B)/(T + C)

We can rearrange to solve for T.

First, compute log10(0.1277):

log10(0.1277) ≈ -0.892.

So,

-0.892 = 8.14019 - (1810.94)/(T +244.485)

Let me rearrange:

(1810.94)/(T +244.485) = 8.14019 +0.892 = 9.03219

So,

T +244.485 = 1810.94 /9.03219 ≈ 200.5

So,

T = 200.5 -244.485 = -43.985 K? That can't be right. Wait, that's impossible because that would give a negative temperature, which doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should check the Antoine equation constants again. Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong units. Let me double-check the Antoine constants. Ah, wait, I think the Antoine equation for water is valid in a certain temperature range, perhaps only for T above a certain value. Alternatively, maybe the constants are for a different pressure unit.

Wait, another source says the Antoine equation for water is:

log10(P) = 8.14019 − 1810.94 / (T + 244.485)

But P is in mmHg. Oh wait! Maybe I was supposed to use P in mmHg instead of bar. That would make more sense.

Because 0.126 atm is 127.68 mmHg (since 1 atm = 760 mmHg, so 0.126*760 ≈ 95.76 mmHg). Wait wait, wait. Let me compute correctly:

0.126 atm *760 mmHg/atm = 95.76 mmHg.

So P =95.76 mmHg.

So now, using the Antoine equation with P in mmHg:

log10(95.76) ≈ 1.982.

So,

1.982 = 8.14019 − (1810.94)/(T +244.485)

Let me rearrange:

(1810.94)/(T +244.485) =8.14019 −1.982 =6.15819

So,

T +244.485 =1810.94 /6.15819 ≈ 294.25 K

So,

T ≈294.25 −244.485 ≈49.76 K? Wait, that's way too low. 49 K is like -224°C, which can't be right because the dew point of water at 0.126 atm should be higher.

Wait, I'm making a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the Antoine constants are for a different range. Alternatively, perhaps I should use another approach, like steam tables.

Wait, the saturation temperature for water at 0.126 atm (which is 95.76 mmHg, as I calculated earlier) can be looked up. Let me try to recall or find an approximate value.

Alternatively, using another form of the Antoine equation where P is in kPa. Alternatively, maybe I should use the ideal gas to find the dew point.

Wait, let me try to find the saturation temperature at 0.126 atm. Let's see, at 1 atm, water boils at 100°C. At lower pressures, the boiling point is lower.

Wait, at 0.126 atm, the boiling point would be lower. Let me think about the approximate temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to estimate the dew point.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that at around 0.1 atm, the boiling point of water is about 45°C. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think: using the Antoine equation correctly. Let me double-check the constants.

Upon checking, the Antoine constants for water (I think) can vary based on the source and the units. Maybe I should use a different set of constants where P is in bar.

Wait, another source gives the Antoine constants for water as A=8.14019, B=1810.94, C=244.485, with P in bar and T in K, valid from 273.15 K to 647.15 K.

Wait, so let's try that again.

We have P = 0.1277 bar.

Compute log10(P) = log10(0.1277) ≈ -0.892.

So,

-0.892 = 8.14019 - (1810.94)/(T +244.485)

So,

(1810.94)/(T +244.485) = 8.14019 +0.892 =9.03219

So,

T +244.485 = 1810.94 /9.03219 ≈ 200.5 K

So,

T ≈ 200.5 -244.485 ≈ -43.985 K.

Wait, that can't be right. Negative temperature? That doesn't make sense. So I'm definitely messing something up.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the equation. Let me check the Antoine equation again. Maybe it's:

log10(P) = A - B/(T + C)

Wait, let me confirm. Yes, that's correct. So if I'm getting a negative temperature, that suggests that the pressure is lower than the minimum for that equation's applicability. Because at very low pressures, the Antoine equation may not hold, or perhaps I've made an error in the units.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me look up the vapor pressure of water at certain temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate the dew point using the ideal gas law, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The dew point is where the partial pressure of H2O equals the saturation pressure at that temperature. So, at the dew point, P_H2O = P_sat(T).

So, given P_H2O = 0.126 atm, we can find T such that P_sat(T) = 0.126 atm.

Looking up a steam table, I can find the temperature where the saturation pressure is 0.126 atm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an online calculator. But since I can't do that, I'll try to recall approximate values.

I know that at 100°C, P_sat is 1 atm.

At 80°C, P_sat is about 0.47 atm.

At 60°C, P_sat is approximately 0.15 atm.

Wait, wait:

Wait, at 60°C, the vapor pressure is about 0.1497 atm, I think.

So, at 60°C, P_sat ≈ 0.15 atm.

We have P_H2O = 0.126 atm, which is slightly less than 0.15 atm, so the dew point should be a bit below 60°C.

Wait, perhaps around 57°C or so.

Wait, let me think again. Let me try to find a more accurate approximation.

Let’s make a table:

Temperature (°C) | P_sat (atm)
--------------------------------
49              | 0.076
50              | 0.078
55
