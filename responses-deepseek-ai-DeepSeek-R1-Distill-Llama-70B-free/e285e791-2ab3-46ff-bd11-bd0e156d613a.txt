Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Carl Rogers and his theory on psychological maladjustment. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about how an individual becomes not well-adjusted according to Rogers. I remember that Rogers was a humanistic psychologist who focused a lot on the concept of self and conditions of worth. His person-centered approach emphasizes the importance of unconditional positive regard.

Wait, so when a person doesn't receive unconditional positive regard, especially in their early years, that might cause issues. I think Rogers talked about how when others, like parents, only give approval conditionally, the child starts to develop a self-concept based on those conditions. So they might feel good about themselves only when they meet certain standards or behave in certain ways.

So the idea is that this conditional regard creates a disconnect between the real experiences of the individual and their self-concept. When their experiences don't align with what others have told them is acceptable, they might feel incongruent. This incongruence can lead to psychological maladjustment because the person isn't being true to themselves.

Looking at the options now:

Option B says that personal evaluations by others, especially in childhood, cause a distance or incongruence between the self and the organism's experiences, leading to maladjustment. That sounds right because it's about others' evaluations affecting self-concept.

Option D mentions adopting others' values without question. I think that's part of it too, but I'm not sure if that's the primary point. Rogers does talk about how taking on others' values can lead to inauthenticity, but the main issue is the conditions leading to a fragmented self-concept.

Option J says self-regard is always conditional. No, that's not right because Rogers believes that in healthy development, self-regard should be unconditional. So J is the opposite of what he suggests.

Option F talks about lack of discipline. I don't think Rogers focused much on that. His emphasis was more on the emotional environment rather than structure or discipline.

So going back, the correct answer should be B because it directly ties others' evaluations to the incongruence between self and organismic experiences, which is a key point in Rogers' theory.

The correct answer is based on Carl Rogers' theory that psychological maladjustment arises when personal evaluations by others, especially during childhood, create a disconnect between an individual's self-concept and their actual experiences. This incongruence leads to maladjustment as the individual struggles with conditional acceptance rather than unconditional positive regard.

Answer: B
