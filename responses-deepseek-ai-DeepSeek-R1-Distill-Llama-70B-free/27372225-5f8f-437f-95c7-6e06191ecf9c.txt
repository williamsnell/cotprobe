Question:

Mary Anne, a piece-worker, makes 370 units each day. A consultant advises that a change in her method would result in 30% more units. Assuming the change really has this result, how many units should Mary Anne produce?

Options:

A: 470 units
B: 485 units
C: 430 units
D: 391 units
E: 451 units
F: 410 units
G: 481 units
H: 520 units
I: 444 units
J: 500 units

Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see... Mary Anne makes 370 units each day. A consultant says that changing her method would result in 30% more units. I need to find out how many units she should produce after this change.

Hmm, right, so the key here is to calculate 30% more than her current production. Wait, so 30% of 370, and then add that to the original 370, right? Because 30% more means you add that percentage on top of the original amount.

So first, I'll calculate 30% of 370. To find 30%, I can convert 30% to a decimal, which is 0.3. Then multiply that by 370. Let me do that step by step.

0.3 times 370... Let's see, 0.3 times 300 is 90, and 0.3 times 70 is 21. So adding those together, 90 + 21 is 111. So 30% of 370 is 111.

Now, I need to add this to the original 370 units to get the new total. So 370 plus 111 equals... let's see, 370 + 100 is 470, and then +11 is 481. So 481 units in total.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So 370 * 0.3: another way to think about it is that 10% of 370 is 37, so 30% is 3 times that. 37 * 3 is 111. Yep, that checks out. Then adding 111 to 370 gives 481.

Looking at the options provided, option G is 481 units. So that's the correct answer.

I don't think I missed anything here. The consultant said a 30% increase, which is straightforward. So Mary Anne's new production should be 481 units.

To determine how many units Mary Anne should produce after a 30% increase, calculate 30% of her current production (370 units) and add it to the original amount.

1. Calculate 30% of 370:  
   \( 0.3 \times 370 = 111 \).

2. Add this to the original 370 units:  
   \( 370 + 111 = 481 \).

Thus, Mary Anne should produce **481 units** after the change. The correct answer is **G**.
