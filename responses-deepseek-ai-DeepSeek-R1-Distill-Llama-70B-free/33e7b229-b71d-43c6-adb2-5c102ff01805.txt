Okay, so I've got this genetics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a cross between two yellow-haired mice. The F1 ratio is given as 2 yellow : 1 nonyellow : 1 yellow (dies). Hmm, wait that's a bit confusing. Let me break it down.

So the parents (P1) are both yellow-haired. Their genotype is Y^ly^L each. I think Y is the gene for yellow hair, and maybe the superscripts are alleles. Oh wait, the notation here is a bit different. I'm more familiar with uppercase letters for dominant alleles and lowercase for recessive, but sometimes it's the opposite. Let me think.

The F1 generation comes from these parents. The cross is set up like a Punnett square. Each parent produces gametes with 1/2 Y^l and 1/2 y^L. So when they cross, the possible genotypes are:

- Y^l Y^l (25%)
- Y^l y^L (50%)
- y^L y^L (25%)

But wait, the F1 ratio is 2 yellow : 1 nonyellow : 1 yellow dies. So that's a total of 4 parts, but one dies. So the survivors are 2 yellow, 1 nonyellow, and one that dies. Let me see.

Looking at the possible genotypes:

Y^l Y^l would express the dominant Y^l, so yellow.

Y^l y^L: depends on dominance. If Y^l is dominant, then this would also be yellow.

y^L y^L: if y^L is recessive, maybe it doesn't show yellow. So nonyellow.

But wait, the F1 has a ratio where some mice die. Oh, perhaps the Y^l Y^l genotype is lethal. Because in the F1, one yellow dies. So 25% Y^l Y^l would die, because that's 1/4 of the total, and the given ratio is 2 yellow survivors, 1 nonyellow, so that's 3 parts but one dies.

Wait, the F1 ratio is 2 yellow : 1 nonyellow : 1 yellow (dies). So total of 4 parts, but one dies. So the four possible outcomes are:

2 yellow (so maybe two of the four are yellow and survive), 1 nonyellow (so one of four is nonyellow), and 1 yellow that dies.

Wait, that can't be right because 2+1+1 would make four. So 2 yellow, 1 nonyellow, and 1 that dies. So the dying is part of the ratio.

So looking at the F1 genotypes:

- Y^l Y^l: dies (25%)
- Y^l y^L: yellow (50%)
- y^L y^L: nonyellow (25%)

So in the F1, 25% die (Y^l Y^l), and the remaining are 50% Y^l y^L (yellow) and 25% y^L y^L (nonyellow). But the ratio of survivors would be (50% + 25%) = 75%, so 50/75 : 25/75 = 2:1. So survivors are 2 yellow : 1 nonyellow, but we also have a 25% that die, which is another yellow. So the F1 ratio is 2 yellow (surviving) : 1 nonyellow : 1 yellow (dead), making 4 parts in total.

So the question is to determine what the surviving mice's genotypes are. The options give different possibilities.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Surviving yellows are Y^l y^L, nonyellow y^L y^L.

That makes sense because Y^l is dominant, so Y^l y^L would show yellow, and y^L y^L would be nonyellow. But wait, Y^l Y^l is the one that dies.

So the surviving yellows are Y^l y^L. The nonyellow is y^L y^L. So option A says exactly that.

Option B: Surviving yellows Y^l Y^l, nonyellow y^L y^L. But Y^l Y^l dies, so that's not possible.

Option C: Surviving yellow Y^L Y^L? Wait, but Y^L is a different allele. Maybe not. So maybe that's not right.

Option D: Surviving yellows y^L y^L. But that would be recessive, so nonyellow. So no, that can't be right.

Option E: Yellows Y^l y^L, nonyellow Y^L y^L. Hmmm, wait. If nonyellow is Y^L y^L, that's Y^L from each parent. But in our cross, the parents are Y^l y^L, so gametes are Y^l and y^L. So the nonyellow would have to be y^L y^L. So E's nonyellow is Y^L y^L, which isn't possible because each gamete gives either Y^l or y^L. So F1 nonyellow would be y^L y^L, not Y^L y^L.

Wait, looking back, the parents are Y^l y^L. So their gametes are Y^l and y^L. So the possible F1 are Y^l Y^l (25%), Y^l y^L (50%), y^L y^L (25%).

So the nonyellow must be y^L y^L. So in the options, the nonyellow is y^L y^L in A, B, and so on.

Looking at option J: Surviving yellows Y^l y^L, nonyellow Y^L y^L. But wait, nonyellow would be y^L y^L, not Y^L something.

So the correct answer would be option A, where surviving yellows are Y^l y^L (which are 50% of the F1, but since 25% die, that leaves 2/3 of survivors as Y^l y^L, and 1/3 as y^L y^L. So the ratio is 2 yellow to 1 nonyellow.

Wait, the question says the F1 ratio is 2 yellow : 1 nonyellow : 1 yellow (dies). So 2:1:1? Or is it 2:1, with an additional 1 that dies?

Wait, perhaps the F1 generation before death would be all four genotypes, but Y^l Y^l dies. So the ratio is 2 yellow survivors (Y^l y^L) to 1 nonyellow (y^L y^L), but since Y^l Y^l (25%) dies, that's the 1 yellow (dying) in the ratio.

So the correct option is the one where surviving yellow is Y^l y^L and nonyellow is y^L y^L.

Looking back, option A says surviving yellows Y^l y^L, nonyellows y^L y^L. That fits.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: Surviving yellow Y^l y^L, nonyellow y^L y^L. Yes.

Other options:

Option J: surviving yellows Y^l y^L, nonyellow Y^L y^L. No, because nonyellow must be y^L y^L.

So the answer should be A.

The question involves a genetic cross between two yellow-haired mice (genotype \( Y^l y^L \)) that produces an F1 ratio of 2 yellow : 1 nonyellow : 1 yellow (dies). The goal is to determine the correct genotypic representation of the surviving yellow and nonyellow mice.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Parental Genotypes and Gametes**: Both parents are \( Y^l y^L \). Each parent produces two types of gametes: \( Y^l \) and \( y^L \), each with a probability of \( \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **F1 Genotypes**: Using a Punnett square, the F1 generation will have the following genotypes:
   - \( Y^l Y^l \) (25%): Dies (lethal genotype).
   - \( Y^l y^L \) (50%): Surviving yellow.
   - \( y^L y^L \) (25%): Surviving nonyellow.

3. **F1 Ratio**: The F1 ratio is 2 yellow : 1 nonyellow : 1 yellow (dies). This corresponds to:
   - 2 yellow survivors (\( Y^l y^L \)).
   - 1 nonyellow survivor (\( y^L y^L \)).
   - 1 yellow that dies (\( Y^l Y^l \)).

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Surviving yellows are \( Y^l y^L \), and nonyellows are \( y^L y^L \). This matches the F1 ratio and is correct.
   - **Option B**: Surviving yellows are \( Y^l Y^l \), but \( Y^l Y^l \) dies, so this is incorrect.
   - **Option C**: Surviving yellows are \( Y^L Y^L \), which is inconsistent with the given genotypes, so this is incorrect.
   - **Option D**: Surviving yellows are \( y^L y^L \), but \( y^L y^L \) is nonyellow, so this is incorrect.
   - **Option E**: Nonyellow is \( Y^L y^L \), which is not possible since nonyellow must be \( y^L y^L \), so this is incorrect.
   - **Option F**: Surviving yellows are \( y^L y^L \), but \( y^L y^L \) is nonyellow, so this is incorrect.
   - **Option G**: Nonyellow is \( Y^l y^L \), which is yellow, so this is incorrect.
   - **Option H**: Surviving yellows are \( Y^l Y^l \), but \( Y^l Y^l \) dies, so this is incorrect.
   - **Option I**: Surviving yellows are \( y^l y^l \), which is not consistent with the given genotypes, so this is incorrect.
   - **Option J**: Nonyellow is \( Y^L y^L \), which is not possible since nonyellow must be \( y^L y^L \), so this is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option A**, where the surviving yellow mice are genotypically \( Y^l y^L \), and the nonyellow mice are \( y^L y^L \).
