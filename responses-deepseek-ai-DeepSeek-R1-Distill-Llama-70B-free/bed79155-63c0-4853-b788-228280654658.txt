Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it again. It's about spaceships and velocities. Hmm, right, I remember this is related to special relativity because velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh wait, the problem says a spaceship is moving away from Earth at 0.75c. Then it launches a rocket that's moving at 0.75c with respect to the spaceship. I need to find the rocket's velocity relative to Earth.

Wait, I think this involves the velocity addition formula from special relativity. In classical mechanics, you'd just add the velocities, right? Like, 0.75c plus another 0.75c would make 1.5c, but that's over the speed of light, which isn't possible. So relativity must have a different way to calculate this.

Right, the relativistic velocity addition formula. I remember it's not a simple addition. The formula is something like (u + v) divided by (1 + (u*v)/(c²)). So u is the velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth, and v is the rocket's velocity relative to the spaceship. Let me make sure I get the formula right. Oh yeah, it's u plus v over 1 plus (uv)/c².

So plugging in the numbers: u is 0.75c, v is 0.75c. Let me compute the numerator and denominator. Numerator is 0.75c + 0.75c = 1.5c. Denominator is 1 + (0.75c * 0.75c) / c². Wait, the c² in the denominator will cancel with the c² from the numerator of the product. So that's 1 + (0.75 * 0.75) = 1 + 0.5625 = 1.5625.

So the velocity is 1.5c divided by 1.5625. Let's compute that. 1.5 divided by 1.5625. Hmm, 1.5 / 1.5625.

Let me think, 1.5625 is equal to 25/16, because 25 divided by 16 is 1.5625. And 1.5 is 24/16. So 24/16 divided by 25/16 is 24/25. 24 divided by 25 is 0.96. So the velocity is 0.96c.

Wait, let me double-check. 0.75c + 0.75c in the formula: (0.75 + 0.75)/(1 + (0.75)^2). So 1.5 / (1 + 0.5625) = 1.5 / 1.5625 = 0.96. Yep, that makes sense.

So the rocket's speed relative to Earth is 0.96 times the speed of light. Looking at the options, option I is 0.96c. So the answer should be I.

To determine the velocity of the rocket with respect to Earth, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u = 0.75c \) (velocity of the spaceship relative to Earth),
- \( v = 0.75c \) (velocity of the rocket relative to the spaceship).

### Step 1: Compute the numerator
\[
u + v = 0.75c + 0.75c = 1.5c
\]

### Step 2: Compute the denominator
\[
1 + \frac{uv}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{(0.75c)(0.75c)}{c^2} = 1 + 0.5625 = 1.5625
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( u' \)
\[
u' = \frac{1.5c}{1.5625} = 0.96c
\]

Thus, the velocity of the rocket with respect to Earth is \( 0.96c \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**I: 0.96c**
