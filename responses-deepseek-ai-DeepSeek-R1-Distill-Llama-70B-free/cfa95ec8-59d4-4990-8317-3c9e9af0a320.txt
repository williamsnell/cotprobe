Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem here. The question is asking for the product of 5 multiplied by -9. Hmm, that sounds like a basic multiplication problem, but I want to make sure I get it right.

Alright, let's break it down. Multiplying a positive number by a negative number should give a negative result, right? Because when you multiply positives, it's positive, and if one is negative, the result is negative. So 5 is positive and -9 is negative. So their product should be negative.

Now, what's 5 times 9? Oh, that's easy, that's 45. So putting it together, 5 times -9 should be -45. Let me just double-check that. If I have 5 groups of -9, that would be adding -9 five times. So -9 + -9 is -18, plus another -9 is -27, and another makes -36, and one more is -45. Yep, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, option B is -45. So I think that's the correct answer. Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't confuse any of the options. Option A is -54, which is way too big because 5*9 is 45, not 54. Option C is 54, which is positive but we know the result should be negative, so that's out. Option D is 35, way off. E is 45, positive again, nope. F is 14, way too small. G is 0, no way. H is -14, no. I is -4, no. J is -35. So the only one that fits is B: -45.

I guess I'm pretty confident now. The product of 5 and -9 is definitely -45.

The product of 5 and −9 is calculated by multiplying the absolute values (5 × 9 = 45) and then applying the sign rule for multiplication (positive × negative = negative). Therefore, the result is −45. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

B: −45

Answer: B
