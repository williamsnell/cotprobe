Okay, so I've got this economics question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about the impact of government spending and taxation on real GDP. Hmm, I remember that government spending and taxes affect the economy in specific ways, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

The question says that the government of country Z increases spending by $12 million and also raises taxes by the same amount. So, spending up by $12M, taxes up by $12M. I need to find out what happens to real GDP.

Wait, I think this relates to fiscal policy. The government can influence the economy through spending and taxation. When the government spends more, it can stimulate the economy, right? But raising taxes takes money out of people's pockets, which might have a negative effect.

Wait, but in this case, both are increased by the same amount. So, the government is spending an extra $12 million but also taking away $12 million in taxes. So the net change might be zero? Or maybe not, because the way the money is spent and collected could have different effects.

I remember something about the balanced budget multiplier. Oh right! If the government increases spending and taxes by the same amount, the net effect isn't zero. Because government spending has a multiplier effect, while taxes might have a different effect depending on how they're used.

Let me recall: The balanced budget theorem says that an increase in government spending matched by an equal increase in taxes will increase aggregate demand. Because government spending directly adds to demand, whereas higher taxes reduce disposable income, but the initial spending has a multiplier effect that's larger.

Wait, actually, the balanced budget multiplier is positive. The formula, I think, is that the change in real GDP is equal to the change in government spending times (1/(1 - MPC)), where MPC is the marginal propensity to consume. But wait, because the taxes are also increased, which would reduce consumption.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let me think in terms of the aggregate demand equation. Aggregate demand (AD) is C + I + G + (X-M). But focusing on G and taxes.

When G increases by $12M, that's a direct increase in AD. But the increase in taxes by $12M would reduce disposable income, which reduces consumption. So the net effect would be the sum of these two impacts.

The initial spending adds $12M to AD. But the tax increase reduces household income, which reduces their spending. The reduction in consumption would be tax increase multiplied by MPC. Let's say MPC is, for example, 0.8. So the tax increase of $12M would reduce consumption by 12 * 0.8 = $9.6M. So the net effect would be 12M - 9.6M = $2.4M increase in AD.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm considering the multipliers correctly. Another approach: the government spending multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC), and the tax multiplier is (MPC)/(1 - MPC). So when G increases by $12M and T increases by $12M, the net change is 12*(1/(1-MPC)) - 12*(MPC/(1-MPC)).

Wait, simplifying that:

12/(1 - MPC) - (12 * MPC)/(1 - MPC) = 12(1 - MPC)/(1 - MPC) ) = 12. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 12/(1 - MPC) - 12MPC/(1 - MPC) = [12 - 12MPC]/(1 - MPC) ) = 12(1 - MPC)/(1 - MPC) ) = 12. So the net effect is 12.

Wait, that suggests that increasing G and T by the same amount leads to an increase in AD by the same amount as the increase in G, which in this case is $12M. But that seems a bit counterintuitive. I thought the effect was a multiplier but perhaps not as much as when only G increases.

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: The balanced budget multiplier is equal to 1. So, when G and T both increase by the same amount, the net effect on AD is exactly equal to the increase in G. So, in this case, a $12M increase in G and T would lead to a $12M increase in AD, and thus real GDP would increase by $12M.

Wait, but if the government increases spending by $12 and raises taxes by $12, the overall effect is a $12 increase in GDP. So the answer would be that real GDP increases by $12 million. Looking at the options, that's option D.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing things. Let me think again. If G goes up by $12 and T goes up by $12, the net effect on the budget is zero. But the impact on the economy is positive because government spending has a more direct effect. The balanced budget multiplier is positive but less than the government spending multiplier alone.

Wait, no, the balanced budget multiplier is actually 1, because when G and T increase by the same amount, the net effect is that AD increases by the same amount as G. So if G goes up by $12M, AD goes up by $12M.

Wait, let me think of it in equations. The aggregate demand equation can be written as:

AD = C + G

And C = (1 - T) * Y * MPC + A (autonomous consumption). Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

AD = C + I + G

But C can be expressed as C = MPC*(Y - T) + C_autonomous.

So, when G increases by ΔG and T increases by ΔT = ΔG, let's say both increase by 12.

So, initial AD becomes:

AD = MPC*(Y - (T + ΔT)) + C_autonomous + I + (G + ΔG)

So, the change in AD would be the effect of ΔG and ΔT.

Alternatively, the change in equilibrium output can be found using the multiplier.

In the standard Keynesian model, the government spending multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC), and the tax multiplier is MPC/(1 - MPC).

So, when G increases by ΔG and T increases by ΔT = ΔG, the total effect on Y is:

ΔY = (ΔG)/(1 - MPC) - (ΔT * MPC)/(1 - MPC)

But since ΔG = ΔT = $12M, this becomes:

ΔY = (12M)/(1 - MPC) - (12M * MPC)/(1 - MPC) = [12M(1 - MPC)] / (1 - MPC) )= 12M.

So, the change in Y is $12M. Therefore, real GDP increases by $12 million.

Looking at the options, the correct answer would be D: Real GDP will increase by $12 million.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the tax reducing consumption, but according to this calculation, the net effect is a $12M increase. So I think D is the correct answer.

When the government of country Z increases spending by $12 million and raises taxes by the same amount, the net impact on real GDP can be analyzed using the concept of the balanced budget multiplier. 

Government spending directly increases aggregate demand (AD), while higher taxes reduce disposable income, which in turn reduces consumption. However, the balanced budget multiplier states that if government spending and taxes increase by the same amount, the net effect on AD is equal to the increase in government spending. This is because the direct injection of government spending into the economy outweighs the reduction in consumption caused by higher taxes.

In this case, the $12 million increase in government spending directly boosts AD, and while the $12 million tax increase reduces consumption, the net effect is still a $12 million increase in real GDP. This result is consistent with the balanced budget multiplier theorem, which predicts that the net effect on AD is equal to the increase in government spending when taxes and spending increase by the same amount.

Thus, real GDP in country Z will increase by $12 million.
