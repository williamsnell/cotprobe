Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is an initial value problem for a second-order linear differential equation. The equation is y'' + γ y' + y = δ(t-1), with initial conditions y(0)=0 and y'(0)=0. I need to find the time t1 when the solution reaches its maximum value. The options are given from A to J, so I have to calculate t1 and match it with the options.

Hmm, I remember that for linear differential equations with delta function inputs, Laplace transforms are a good tool to use. Yeah, Laplace transforms can handle the delta function easily. So maybe I should start by taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation.

Let me write down the Laplace transform of each term. The Laplace transform of y'' is s²Y(s) - s y(0) - y'(0). Since y(0) and y'(0) are both zero, this simplifies to s²Y(s). Similarly, the Laplace transform of y' is sY(s) - y(0), which is sY(s). The Laplace transform of y is Y(s). 

On the right-hand side, the delta function δ(t-1) has a Laplace transform of e^{-s}, because the transform of δ(t-a) is e^{-a s}.

Putting it all together, the equation becomes:
s² Y(s) + γ s Y(s) + Y(s) = e^{-s}
So, Y(s) (s² + γ s + 1) = e^{-s}
Therefore, Y(s) = e^{-s} / (s² + γ s + 1)

Now, I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s) to get y(t). The denominator is a quadratic, so perhaps it's a damped sinusoid or an exponentially decaying function depending on whether the roots are complex or real.

Wait, the denominator can be written as s² + γ s +1. The discriminant is γ² -4*1*1 = γ² -4. Depending on γ, the roots can be real and distinct, repeated, or complex conjugates. But since the input is a delta function, and the system is underdamped (likely), I'll assume that the roots are complex, so the solution will involve a sinusoid multiplied by an exponential.

Let me factor the denominator. The standard form is (s + α)^2 + β², where α is γ/2, and β is sqrt(1 - (γ²/4)). So, the inverse Laplace would involve e^{-α t} [cos(β t) + something]. But wait, the numerator is e^{-s}, which suggests a time shift. Oh, right! There's a time shift in the Laplace transform.

So, let's think about this. Y(s) has an e^{-s} factor, which means the inverse Laplace will involve a shifted function. So, the function y(t) will be zero until t=1, and then for t>1, it's the inverse transform of 1/(s² + γ s +1).

Wait, no. Wait, the Laplace transform is e^{-s} multiplied by 1/(s² + γ s +1). So, the inverse would be the function u(t-1) multiplied by the inverse transform of 1/(s² + γ s +1).

So, y(t) = H(t-1) * [inverse of 1/(s² + γ s +1)] evaluated at (t-1).

So, what's the inverse of 1/(s² + γ s +1)? Let me compute that. Let me complete the square in the denominator. 

Denominator: s² + γ s +1 = (s + γ/2)^2 + (1 - γ²/4) = (s + γ/2)^2 + ω², where ω = sqrt(1 - (γ²/4)).

So, 1/(s² + γ s +1) = 1/[(s + γ/2)^2 + ω^2]. The inverse Laplace transform of this is e^{-γ t/2} [ (1/ω) sin(ω t) ].

Wait, but wait: the standard form is 1/[(s+a)^2 + b²], whose inverse is (1/b) e^{-a t} sin(b t). So yes, correct.

So then, the inverse Laplace of 1/(s² + γ s +1) is (1/ω) e^{-γ t/2} sin(ω t).

But remember that in Y(s), we have this multiplied by e^{-s}, so the inverse is u(t-1) multiplied by (1/ω) e^{-γ (t-1)/2} sin[ω (t-1)].

So, putting it all together, the solution y(t) is:

y(t) = [u(t-1)] * (1/ω) e^{-γ (t-1)/2} sin[ω (t-1)]

Where ω = sqrt(1 - γ²/4). Wait, but this is under the assumption that γ² <4, meaning underdamped. If γ were equal to or larger than 2, we'd have different behavior, but I think the problem is considering underdamped since it's a typical case.

Now, the question is to find the time t1 when y(t) reaches its maximum. Since y(t) is zero before t=1, the maximum must occur at some t>1.

So, the function we're looking at for t>1 is:

y(t) = (1/ω) e^{-γ (t-1)/2} sin[ω (t-1)]

To find its maximum, take the derivative of y(t) with respect to t, set it to zero, and solve for t.

Let me compute y'(t):

y'(t) = d/dt [ (1/ω) e^{-γ (t-1)/2} sin(ω (t-1)) ]

Let's denote τ = t-1, so τ = t-1, so t = τ +1, and for t>1, τ>0.

Then y(t) becomes:

y(τ) = (1/ω) e^{-γ τ/2} sin(ω τ)

So, y'(t) with respect to t is dy/dτ * dτ/dt. Since dτ/dt is 1, it's just dy/dτ.

Compute dy/dτ:

dy/dτ = (1/ω) [ -γ/2 e^{-γ τ/2} sin(ω τ) + e^{-γ τ/2} ω cos(ω τ) ]

Factor out e^{-γ τ/2}:

dy/dτ = (1/ω) e^{-γ τ/2} [ -γ/2 sin(ω τ) + ω cos(ω τ) ]

Set dy/dτ = 0 to find extrema:

(1/ω) e^{-γ τ/2} [ -γ/2 sin(ω τ) + ω cos(ω τ) ] = 0

Since e^{-γ τ/2} is never zero, and 1/ω is non-zero (because ω is sqrt(1 - γ²/4), and γ² <4 so ω>0), the term in the brackets must be zero:

-γ/2 sin(ω τ) + ω cos(ω τ) = 0

Let me write this as:

ω cos(ω τ) = (γ/2) sin(ω τ)

Divide both sides by cos(ω τ) (assuming cos(ω τ) ≠0):

ω = (γ/2) tan(ω τ)

So tan(ω τ) = (2 ω)/γ

But ω is sqrt(1 - γ²/4). Let me compute 2ω/γ:

2ω/γ = 2 * sqrt(1 - γ²/4) / γ

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to express in terms of known variables. Let me denote θ = ω τ. Then we have:

tan θ = (2 ω)/γ

But θ = ω τ, so τ = θ/ω.

So tan θ = (2 ω)/γ.

Wait, but let's express 2ω/γ:

2ω/γ = 2 * sqrt(1 - (γ²/4)) / γ.

Let me compute that:

sqrt(1 - γ²/4) = sqrt( (4 - γ²)/4 ) = sqrt(4 - γ²)/2.

So 2 * [sqrt(4 - γ²)/2 ] = sqrt(4 - γ²).

So 2ω = sqrt(4 - γ²).

Wait, no: 2ω = 2 * sqrt(1 - γ²/4) = 2 * sqrt( (4 - γ²)/4 ) = 2 * [sqrt(4 - γ²)/2] ] = sqrt(4 - γ²).

Yes, correct. So 2ω = sqrt(4 - γ²). Therefore, 2ω/γ = sqrt(4 - γ²)/γ.

So tan θ = sqrt(4 - γ²)/γ.

Hmm, perhaps I can think of this in terms of a right triangle. Let me imagine a right triangle where the opposite side is sqrt(4 - γ²) and the adjacent side is γ. Then the hypotenuse would be sqrt( γ² + (4 - γ²) ) = sqrt(4) =2.

So, in this triangle, sin θ = opposite/hypotenuse = sqrt(4-γ²)/2, and cos θ = adjacent/hypotenuse = γ/2.

Wait, but in our case, tan θ = sqrt(4 - γ^2)/γ = [sqrt(4-γ²)] / γ.

So, θ = arctan( sqrt(4-γ²)/ γ )

Alternatively, perhaps using some trigonometric identities. Wait, let me think differently.

But perhaps it's easier to proceed with substitution. Let me compute θ from tan θ = (2ω)/γ.

So, θ = arctan( 2ω / γ )

But 2ω is sqrt(4 - γ²), so θ = arctan( sqrt(4 - γ²)/ γ ).

Wait, but sqrt(4 - γ²) is 2ω, as we saw earlier. No, wait, 2ω is sqrt(4 - γ²) because 2ω = sqrt(4 - γ²). So, 2ω/γ = sqrt(4 - γ²)/γ.

Wait, then tan θ = sqrt(4 - γ²)/ γ.

So, θ = arctan( sqrt(4 - γ²)/ γ )

Hmm, perhaps I can express this in terms of some angle. Let me think about a substitution. Let me let phi be an angle such that cos(phi) = γ / 2. Because if we have a right triangle where the adjacent side is γ and hypotenuse is 2, then the opposite side would be sqrt(4 - γ²). So phi = arccos(γ/2).

Then, sin(phi) = sqrt(4 - γ^2)/2.

So, tan(phi) = [sqrt(4 - γ^2)] / γ.

Wait, that's exactly what we have for tan(theta) = sqrt(4 - γ^2)/ γ.

So, tan(theta) = tan(phi), so theta = phi + k pi, but since we're dealing with the first occurrence after τ=0, we can take theta=phi.

So, theta = arccos(γ/2), since phi = arccos(γ/2). 

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me make sure. If cos(phi) = γ/2, then the opposite side is sqrt(4 - γ²), so tan(phi) = sqrt(4 - γ²)/γ. Which is exactly the ratio we have in tan(theta). So theta = phi, which is arccos(γ/2). 

Therefore, theta = arccos(γ/2).

But theta is omega tau, so:

omega tau = arccos(γ/2)

So, tau = arccos(γ/2) / omega

But tau is t -1, so:

t1 = 1 + [ arccos(γ/2) ] / omega

Wait, but what is omega? Omega is sqrt(1 - gamma^2/4). Let's write that as:

omega = sqrt( (4 - gamma^2) ) / 2.

Because sqrt(1 - gamma^2/4) = sqrt( (4 - gamma^2)/4 ) = sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/2.

So, omega = sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/2.

So, substituting back, tau = arccos(γ/2) / [ sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/2 ]

Which simplifies to:

tau = 2 arccos(γ/2) / sqrt(4 - gamma^2)

So, t1 = 1 + [ 2 arccos( γ / 2 ) ] / sqrt(4 - gamma^2 )

Wait, but this seems a bit complicated. Is there a simpler expression?

Alternatively, perhaps we can express this in terms of natural logarithms. Because sometimes, solving tan(theta) = something leads to expressions involving ln.

Wait, let me go back to the equation where we had:

tan(theta) = sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/gamma.

Let me write this as:

tan(theta) = sqrt( (4/gamma^2) -1 )

Hmm, because sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/gamma = sqrt( (4 - gamma^2) ) / gamma = sqrt( (4/gamma^2) -1 ) * (1/gamma) * gamma? Not sure.

Alternatively, cross-multiplied: sin(theta)/cos(theta) = sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/gamma.

Which can be written as:

gamma sin(theta) = sqrt(4 - gamma^2) cos(theta)

Square both sides:

gamma^2 sin^2(theta) = (4 - gamma^2) cos^2(theta)

Using identity sin^2 + cos^2 =1:

gamma^2 (1 - cos^2(theta)) = (4 - gamma^2) cos^2(theta)

Expand:

gamma^2 - gamma^2 cos^2(theta) = 4 cos^2(theta) - gamma^2 cos^2(theta)

Simplify:

gamma^2 = 4 cos^2(theta)

So cos(theta) = ± gamma /2

But since theta is in a range where tan(theta) is positive, and we're looking for the first maximum after t=1, theta is in the first quadrant, so cos(theta) is positive. So cos(theta) = gamma/2.

Wait, that makes sense because earlier I had phi = arccos(gamma/2), and theta=phi. So that's consistent.

So, theta = arccos(gamma/2).

Now, substituting back, tau = theta / omega.

We have theta = arccos(gamma/2), and omega = sqrt(1 - gamma^2/4) = sqrt( (4 - gamma^2) )/2.

So tau = [ arccos(gamma/2) ] / [ sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/2 ]

Which is tau = 2 arccos(gamma/2) / sqrt(4 - gamma^2 )

Hmm, but perhaps there's a trigonometric identity that can help simplify this expression.

Wait, let me think about arccos(gamma/2). Let me denote phi = arccos(gamma/2), so that cos(phi) = gamma/2. Then, from the identity, sin(phi) = sqrt(1 - (gamma/2)^2 ) = sqrt( (4 - gamma^2)/4 ) = sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/2.

So, sin(phi) = sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/2.

So, 2 sin(phi) = sqrt(4 - gamma^2).

So, tau = 2 phi / (2 sin(phi) ) = phi / sin(phi)

Wait, that's a simplification! Because:

tau = [ 2 arccos(gamma/2) ] / sqrt(4 - gamma^2 )

But sqrt(4 - gamma^2) = 2 sin(phi), since sin(phi)=sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/2.

So,

tau = [ 2 phi ] / (2 sin(phi) )

Which simplifies to phi / sin(phi).

So, tau = phi / sin(phi) = [ arccos(gamma/2) ] / [ sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/2 ]

Wait, no, because phi is arccos(gamma/2), and sin(phi) is sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/2. So, phi/sin(phi) would be [ arccos(gamma/2) ] / [ sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/2 ]

Wait, I think I made a mistake in substitution. Let me retrace.

I had:

tau = 2 arccos(gamma/2) / sqrt(4 - gamma^2 )

But sqrt(4 - gamma^2) = 2 sin(phi), where phi=arccos(gamma/2).

So, sqrt(4 - gamma^2) = 2 sin(phi) → sin(phi) = sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/2.

So, substituting back:

tau = [ 2 phi ] / (2 sin(phi) ) → tau = phi / sin(phi).

Therefore, tau = phi / sin(phi).

But phi is arccos(gamma/2), so:

tau = arccos(gamma/2) / [ sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/2 ]

Wait, no. Because sin(phi) = sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/2, so 1/sin(phi) = 2 / sqrt(4 - gamma^2).

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things here. Let me try a different approach. Let's calculate tau in terms of phi.

So, tau = (2 phi) / sqrt(4 - gamma^2).

But phi is arccos(gamma/2), and sqrt(4 - gamma^2) is 2 sin(phi), as established earlier.

So, tau = (2 phi) / (2 sin(phi)) ) → tau = phi / sin(phi).

So, tau = phi / sin(phi) = [ arccos(gamma/2) ] / [ sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/2 ]

Wait, no, because sin(phi) is sqrt(4 - gamma^2)/2, so 1/sin(phi) is 2/sqrt(4 - gamma^2).

Hmm, perhaps I should consider specific values of gamma to see if any of the options match. Wait, the problem doesn't specify gamma, but the options are numerical. So perhaps the question assumes a particular value for gamma
