Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about a belief regarding a child's misbehavior and which psychological theory it aligns with. Let me break this down step by step.

The question states that the belief is that a child's misbehavior has one of four goals: attention, revenge, power, or to display inadequacy. I need to match this with the correct psychological theory from the given options.

First, I'll list out the options again to make sure I have them all:

A: Skinner's behaviorism
B: Adler’s individual psychology.
C: Beck’s cognitive-behavioral therapy.
D: Perls’s Gestalt therapy.
E: Erikson's stages of psychosocial development
F: Freud's psychoanalytic theory
G: Mahler’s object relations theory.
H: Piaget's theory of cognitive development
I: Rogers's person-centered therapy
J: Bandura's social learning theory

Now, I need to think about each of these theories and what they say about child behavior, particularly misbehavior.

Skinner's behaviorism (Option A) is all about operant conditioning, where behavior is driven by rewards and punishments. So, if a child misbehaves, it's because they're seeking a reward (like attention) or avoiding punishment. But does Skinner specifically outline four goals like attention, revenge, etc.? I'm not sure. Skinner focuses more on external factors rather than internal goals.

Adler’s individual psychology (Option B) emphasizes the importance of social interests and striving for superiority. Adler talked about children's behavior as attempts to gain power or control, especially in the family setting. He also discussed how children might misbehave to get attention or because they feel inadequate. That sounds closer to the four goals mentioned.

Beck’s CBT (Option C) focuses on cognitive distortions and how thoughts influence behavior. It's more about identifying negative thought patterns rather than categorizing misbehavior into specific goals.

Perls's Gestalt therapy (Option D) deals with the here and now, and personal responsibility. It's about awareness of the present moment and doesn't specifically categorize child misbehavior into those four goals.

Erikson's psychosocial stages (Option E) are about developmental stages and crises. Each stage has a specific conflict, but I don't recall him listing specific goals for misbehavior.

Freud's psychoanalysis (Option F) is about unconscious drives and the id, ego, superego. Misbehavior might be seen as a result of unconscious conflicts, but not neatly into the four categories mentioned.

Mahler's object relations (Option G) is about the development of the sense of self through early relationships. It's more about attachment and separation issues rather than specific behavioral goals.

Piaget's cognitive development (Option H) focuses on how children think and learn, not so much on why they misbehave in terms of specific goals.

Rogers's person-centered therapy (Option I) emphasizes unconditional positive regard and self-actualization. It's about the therapeutic relationship, not categorizing misbehavior.

Bandura's social learning (Option J) talks about learning through observation and imitation. It includes reinforcement, but again, not the specific four goals mentioned.

So, going back, the key here is the four goals: attention, revenge, power, inadequacy. Adler’s theory seems to fit because he discussed children's misbehavior as attempts to get attention, to seek power, or because of feelings of inadequacy. I remember something about Adler saying that children may act out in certain ways to achieve these ends, especially in the context of family dynamics.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on whether Adler exactly listed those four. Let me think again. Adler's theory includes the concept of 'striving for superiority,' which is about seeking power or control. He also talked about the importance of social interest and feelings of inferiority. When children feel inadequate, they might misbehave to get attention or as a form of revenge against others they feel have wronged them. So yes, the four goals mentioned in the question align with Adler's ideas about the underlying reasons for children's misbehavior.

So the answer should be B: Adler’s individual psychology.

The question asks which psychological theory aligns with the belief that a child's misbehavior is driven by one of four goals: attention, revenge, power, or to display inadequacy. To determine the correct answer, each option was analyzed in relation to the four goals mentioned:

- **Skinner's behaviorism (A)** focuses on operant conditioning and external rewards/punishments but does not specifically outline the four goals.
- **Adler’s individual psychology (B)** emphasizes striving for superiority, social interests, and feelings of inadequacy. Adler discussed how children might misbehave to gain attention, power, or as an act of revenge, aligning closely with the four goals.
- **Beck’s cognitive-behavioral therapy (C)** focuses on cognitive distortions and thoughts influencing behavior, not specific behavioral goals.
- **Perls’s Gestalt therapy (D)** emphasizes awareness and personal responsibility in the present moment, unrelated to the four goals.
- **Erikson's psychosocial stages (E)** involve developmental stages and crises but do not categorize misbehavior into specific goals.
- **Freud's psychoanalytic theory (F)** attributes misbehavior to unconscious drives, not the four goals mentioned.
- **Mahler’s object relations theory (G)** focuses on early relationships and attachment, not specific behavioral goals.
- **Piaget's cognitive development (H)** concerns how children think and learn, not misbehavior goals.
- **Rogers's person-centered therapy (I)** emphasizes unconditional positive regard and self-actualization, not the four goals.
- **Bandura's social learning theory (J)** involves learning through observation and imitation but does not specify the four goals.

Adler’s theory best matches the four goals, as it explains misbehavior in terms of attention-seeking, power struggles, revenge, and feelings of inadequacy. 

Answer: B
