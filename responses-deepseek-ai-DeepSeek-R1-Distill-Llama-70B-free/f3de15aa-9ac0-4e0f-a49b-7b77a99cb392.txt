Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the total sale at a gas station. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says a motorist buys 13 and 6/10 gallons of gas. Wait, 6/10 is the same as 0.6, right? So that's 13.6 gallons total. And the price per gallon is $0.539. I think I need to multiply these two numbers together to get the cost of the gas.

So, 13.6 gallons multiplied by $0.539 per gallon. Let me do the math. Hmm, 13 times 0.539 is... let's see, 13 * 0.5 is 6.5, and 13 * 0.039 is 0.507. Adding those together gives 7.007. Then I have the 0.6 gallons left. 0.6 * 0.539 is, well, 0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3, and 0.6 * 0.039 is 0.0234. So adding those gives 0.3234. So total gas cost is 7.007 + 0.3234, which is 7.3304 dollars. Let me write that as $7.33 approximately.

Next, the motorist buys 2 quarts of oil at $1.10 per quart. Oh wait, quarts, so 2 quarts would just be 2 multiplied by 1.10. That's easy. 2 * 1.10 is $2.20.

Now, to find the total sale, I need to add the gas cost and the oil cost. So $7.33 plus $2.20. That adds up to $9.53.

Looking at the options, J is $9.53. So the answer should be J.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Gas calculation again: 13.6 gallons * $0.539. Let me compute that more accurately. 

13 * 0.539 = let's break it down. 10 * 0.539 is 5.39, and 3 * 0.539 is 1.617. Adding those gives 5.39 + 1.617 = 7.007. Then 0.6 * 0.539 is 0.3234. So total is 7.007 + 0.3234 = 7.3304, which rounds to 7.33. That seems correct.

Oil is 2 * 1.10 = 2.20. Adding 7.33 + 2.20 gives 9.53. Yep, that's right. So option J is the correct answer.

The total sale is calculated by adding the cost of the gasoline and the oil. 

1. **Gasoline Cost**:  
   - Volume purchased: 13.6 gallons  
   - Price per gallon: $0.539  
   - Calculation: \( 13.6 \times 0.539 = 7.3304 \), which rounds to $7.33.  

2. **Oil Cost**:  
   - Volume purchased: 2 quarts  
   - Price per quart: $1.10  
   - Calculation: \( 2 \times 1.10 = 2.20 \).  

3. **Total Sale**:  
   - Sum of gasoline and oil costs: \( 7.33 + 2.20 = 9.53 \).  

Thus, the total sale is **$9.53**, which corresponds to option **J**.
