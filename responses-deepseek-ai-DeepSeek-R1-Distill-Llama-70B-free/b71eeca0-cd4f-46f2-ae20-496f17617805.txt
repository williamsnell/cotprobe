Question:

Congress enacted a statute designed to make the stabilization of rents more effective throughout the United States. The statute will be applicable to all leasehold contracts hereafter entered into between landlords and tenants involving residential and commercial properties. The new federal statute is intended to protect tenants from spiraling rents and "profiteering" by landlords without curtailing the supply of rental units or depriving landlords of substantial constitutional rights. The new federal statute would be most clearly constitutional as applied to

Options:

A: the rental of a vacation home by an individual landlord to a family on a short-term lease.
B: the rental of a state-owned office building by a state to a privately owned business.
C: the rental of a college dormitory by a private university to its students.
D: the rental of residential property located in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six.
E: the rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically focusing on the Commerce Clause and federal regulation. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about a new federal statute that aims to stabilize rents across the U.S. It applies to all future lease contracts between landlords and tenants for both residential and commercial properties. The goal is to protect tenants from high rents and stop landlords from making excessive profits. But it also tries to balance by not curbing the supply of rental units or infringing too much on landlords' constitutional rights.

The question is asking which scenario the statute would most clearly be constitutional as applied to. The options are A through E.

First, I need to recall the relevant constitutional principles. The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. So, the federal government can pass laws in areas that have a significant impact on trade across state lines.

Looking at each option:

Option A: Rental of a vacation home by an individual landlord to a family on a short-term lease. So, this is a private transaction between two parties, probably within the same state. Vacation homes are typically for individual use, not commercial purposes. I'm thinking that this might not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Unless the property is rented frequently to out-of-state people, but even then, individual leases might be considered too localized.

Option B: Rental of a state-owned office building by the state to a private business. Here, the landlord is a state government, so this is a state action. The Commerce Clause usually applies to private conduct, not state government actions unless the state is engaging in economic activity that affects interstate commerce. But wait, the statute applies to all leasehold contracts, including those involving states. However, states have sovereign immunity, so Congress can't regulate state activities unless it's under a valid constitutional power that allows it to bind the states. The Commerce Clause can sometimes do that, but there are limitations. Also, the Tenth Amendment might be a consideration here, as it protects states' powers. I'm not too sure about this one, but it might be problematic because the landlord is a state entity.

Option C: Rental of a college dormitory by a private university to its students. A private university is not a state actor, so the Commerce Clause applies if the activity affects interstate commerce. Dormitories are a part of the educational services, and students might come from out of state. But renting dorms is more of a local activity. However, the question is whether the rental of such properties has a sufficient impact on interstate commerce. If the university is engaging in interstate commerce by attracting students from other states, maybe. But I'm not certain if that connection is strong enough for the Commerce Clause to apply here. It might be a stretch.

Option D: Rental of residential property in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family. The District of Columbia is a federal enclave, so Congress has plenary authority over it. Any federal law applies directly without worrying about state sovereignty. So, since D.C. is under federal jurisdiction, Congress can regulate activities there without needing to rely on the Commerce Clause. Therefore, the statute would clearly be constitutional here because it's within Congress's direct authority.

Option E: Rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord. The tenant here is a city government, which is a state entity. So similar to option B, this involves a state actor as the tenant. The landlord is private, though. So the lease is between a private individual and a city. The question is whether this affects interstate commerce enough for the Commerce Clause to apply. Office buildings are commercial properties, and if the city is involved in activities that affect commerce, maybe. But wait, the regulation is on the landlord's ability to set rent. If the landlord is private and the tenant is a city, does that lease have a substantial effect on interstate commerce? Possibly, especially if the office is used for purposes that involve interstate activities. But I'm not sure if this is as direct as option D.

So, considering each option, option D stands out because it's in the District of Columbia, where Congress has direct authority. The Commerce Clause is about regulating interstate commerce, so for the other options, the question is whether each activity has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. But since D doesn't require that analysis—it's within Congress's exclusive jurisdiction—it's the clearest case where the statute is constitutional.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D.

The question concerns the constitutionality of a federal statute aimed at stabilizing rents across the United States, specifically under the Commerce Clause and Congress's regulatory powers. The statute applies to all future leasehold contracts involving residential and commercial properties. The analysis evaluates each option to determine where the statute would most clearly be constitutional.

- **Option A**: The rental of a vacation home by an individual landlord to a family on a short-term lease is a private, localized transaction. It lacks a substantial effect on interstate commerce, making the statute's constitutionality here unclear.

- **Option B**: The rental of a state-owned office building by a state to a private business involves state action. While the Commerce Clause can bind states in certain cases, sovereign immunity and Tenth Amendment protections make this application problematic.

- **Option C**: The rental of a college dormitory by a private university to its students is more of a local activity, despite potentially attracting out-of-state students. The connection to interstate commerce is weak, making this option less clear.

- **Option D**: The rental of residential property in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family is directly subject to Congress's plenary authority, as the District is a federal enclave. This makes the statute's constitutionality here clear and unambiguous.

- **Option E**: The rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord involves a state actor as the tenant. While the lease might have some connection to interstate commerce, this is less direct than the clear federal authority in Option D.

The clearest case for the statute's constitutionality is **Option D**, as it falls under Congress's direct jurisdiction over the District of Columbia, bypassing the need for Commerce Clause analysis.
