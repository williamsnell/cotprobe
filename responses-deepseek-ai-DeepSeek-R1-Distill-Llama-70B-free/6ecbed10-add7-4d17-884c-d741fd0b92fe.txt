Okay, so I have this math problem here about matrices, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem states: Let I be not equal to A, and A is not equal to -I, where I is the identity matrix and A is a real 2x2 matrix. Also, it's given that A equals its inverse, A = A^(-1). The question is asking for the trace of A, and there are multiple-choice options provided.

Hmm, okay. I remember that for a matrix A, if A is its own inverse, then A squared should equal the identity matrix. Because if A = A^(-1), then multiplying both sides by A gives A^2 = I. So, that's a key point.

Wait, right, because A * A = I. So that's an important equation: A² = I.

Now, the trace of a matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements. For a 2x2 matrix, it's just the sum of the top-left and bottom-right elements.

But how does knowing that A squared equals I help me find the trace? Oh, right, I think there's something about the eigenvalues here. Because if A² = I, then the eigenvalues of A must satisfy λ² = 1. So the eigenvalues of A are either 1 or -1.

Wait, but wait. The trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues. So if the eigenvalues are 1 and 1, the trace is 2. If they're 1 and -1, the trace is 0. If they're both -1, the trace is -2. But wait, the problem says that I is not equal to A, and A is not equal to -I. So A can't be the identity matrix or the negative identity matrix.

Wait, let me think. If A were equal to I, then obviously A equals I, but the problem says that's not allowed. Similarly, A can't be -I. So that means that A is some other matrix that when squared gives I. So the eigenvalues can't both be 1 (because that would make A equal to I, but with possible scaling, but wait, for 2x2, if both eigenvalues are 1, then A is I, right? Or maybe A is similar to I, which would just be I itself. Similarly for -1.

Wait, but if A is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal entries 1, that's the identity matrix. So if A can't be I, then the eigenvalues can't both be 1. Similarly, if both are -1, then A would be -I, which is also not allowed. So the only possibility is that the eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So the trace would be 1 + (-1) = 0.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Because if A is a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues 1 and -1, then it's diagonalizable, right? So it can be written as a diagonal matrix with 1 and -1 on the diagonal. But then, such a matrix would satisfy A squared equals I because each diagonal entry squared is 1. So that's correct.

Alternatively, what if A is not diagonal? Like, a Jordan block? Well, if A is a Jordan block, then it would have complex eigenvalues, but since A is real, the eigenvalues must be real. So in this case, the only real eigenvalues are 1 and -1, so A must be similar to a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1 and -1. So the trace is 0.

Wait, but wait, what's the trace in that case? 1 + (-1) is 0. So the trace of A is 0.

Looking at the options, option B is 0. So that's probably the correct answer.

But let me think again to check for any mistakes. So A is a real 2x2 matrix where A^2 = I, and A isn't equal to I or -I. So A must have eigenvalues 1 and -1 because otherwise, if both were 1, A would be I, which is excluded, and both being -1 would make A = -I, which is also excluded. Therefore, the trace is 0.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be B.
</think>

Given that \( A = A^{-1} \), it follows that \( A^2 = I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. This implies that the eigenvalues of \( A \), denoted as \( \lambda \), must satisfy \( \lambda^2 = 1 \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A \) can only be \( 1 \) or \( -1 \).

Since \( A \neq I \) and \( A \neq -I \), \( A \) cannot have both eigenvalues equal to \( 1 \) (which would make \( A = I \)) or both eigenvalues equal to \( -1 \) (which would make \( A = -I \)). The only remaining possibility is that \( A \) has one eigenvalue \( 1 \) and the other \( -1 \).

The trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues. For \( A \), this means:

\[
\text{Trace}(A) = 1 + (-1) = 0.
\]

Thus, the trace of \( A \) is \( 0 \).

The correct answer is **B: 0**.
