Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: I need to find the value of N that satisfies the equation (4^(3^3)) / ((4^3)^3) equals 2^N. And the options are A through J with various numbers. Hmm.

Alright, let's break this down. The equation is a bit complex with exponents stacked on each other, so I think I should simplify both the numerator and the denominator first.

Starting with the numerator: 4 raised to the power of 3^3. Wait, 3^3 is 27, right? So 4^27. That's a big number, but maybe I can express it in terms of base 2. Because 4 is 2 squared, so 4 is 2^2. So substituting that in, 4^27 becomes (2^2)^27. 

Wait, when you raise a power to a power, you multiply the exponents. So (2^2)^27 is 2^(2*27) which is 2^54. So the numerator simplifies to 2^54. Okay, got that part.

Now the denominator: (4^3)^3. Let me tackle this step by step. First, compute 4^3, which is 4*4*4. 4*4 is 16, times 4 is 64. So 4^3 is 64. Then, we raise that result to the 3rd power again. So 64^3. 

But again, maybe it's easier to express this in terms of base 2. Since 4 is 2^2, 4^3 would be (2^2)^3. Oh wait, that's 2^(2*3) which is 2^6, which is 64. So (4^3) is 2^6. Now, we raise that to the third power: (2^6)^3. Again, raising a power to a power, multiply exponents. So 2^(6*3) which is 2^18. So the denominator is 2^18.

Now putting it all together, the original expression is numerator divided by denominator, so 2^54 divided by 2^18. When you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract them. So 54 minus 18 is 36. Therefore, the expression simplifies to 2^36.

But wait, the equation says this equals 2^N. So 2^36 equals 2^N, which means N must be 36. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Numerator: 4^(3^3) = 4^27 = (2^2)^27 = 2^54. That seems right.
Denominator: (4^3)^3. 4^3 is 64, which is 2^6. Then (2^6)^3 is 2^18. So denominator is 2^18.
Dividing 2^54 by 2^18 gives 2^(54-18) = 2^36. So N is 36. Looking at the options, option C is 36, so the answer should be C.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't mix up the exponents anywhere. Another way to approach it: Maybe simplify the entire fraction before breaking it down. Let me see.

The original expression is 4^(3^3) divided by (4^3)^3. Let's write everything in terms of exponents of 4 first.

4^(3^3) is 4^27. (4^3)^3 is 4^(3*3) = 4^9. So now the expression is 4^27 / 4^9. Subtracting exponents, 27-9=18, so 4^18. But wait, that's different from earlier! Oh no, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait wait, no. Because in this approach, I'm writing it as 4^18, but earlier I converted 4 to 2^2, so 4^18 is (2^2)^18 = 2^(36). Oh right, because 4^18 equals 2^(2*18) which is 2^36. So that's consistent with my earlier result. So N is 36, so option C.

I think I confused myself for a moment there, but both methods give the same answer. So I'm confident that the correct N is 36, which is option C.

To solve the equation \(\frac{4^{(3^3)}}{(4^3)^3} = 2^N\), we start by simplifying both the numerator and the denominator.

1. **Numerator**: \(4^{(3^3)}\). Since \(3^3 = 27\), this becomes \(4^{27}\). Expressing \(4\) in terms of base \(2\), we have \(4 = 2^2\). Thus, \(4^{27} = (2^2)^{27} = 2^{2 \cdot 27} = 2^{54}\).

2. **Denominator**: \((4^3)^3\). First, compute \(4^3\): \(4^3 = 64\). Then raise \(64\) to the power of \(3\): \(64^3\). Expressing \(64\) in terms of base \(2\), we have \(64 = 2^6\). Thus, \((4^3)^3 = (2^6)^3 = 2^{6 \cdot 3} = 2^{18}\).

3. **Combine the results**: The original expression becomes \(\frac{2^{54}}{2^{18}}\). When dividing exponents with the same base, subtract the exponents: \(2^{54-18} = 2^{36}\).

Since the equation simplifies to \(2^{36} = 2^N\), it follows that \(N = 36\).

Thus, the correct answer is **C: 36**.
