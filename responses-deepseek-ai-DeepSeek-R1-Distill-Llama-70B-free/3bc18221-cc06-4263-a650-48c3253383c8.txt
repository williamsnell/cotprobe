Question:

The flow through a sluice gate set into a dam is to be investigated by building a model of the dam and sluice at 1 : 20 scale. Calculate the head at which the model should work to give conditions corresponding to a prototype head of 20 meters. If the discharge from the model under this corresponding head is 0.5 m^3/s, estimate the discharge from the prototype dam. A relationship between a set of physical variables can be stated as a relationship between a set of independent dimensionless groups made up from suitably chosen variables. The variables involved in this problem are Q -- the flow rate, d -- a leading dimension of the sluice, h -- the head over the sluice, \rho -- the mass density of the water, g -- the gravity field intensity and \mu -- the viscosity of water, so that there is some function, f (Q, \rho, g, h, d, \mu) = 0

Okay, so I've got this problem about a sluice gate model and the prototype. Hmm, I remember from my fluid mechanics class that when dealing with models and prototypes, similitude laws are used. Oh right, like Reynolds, Froude, or Euler numbers. But wait, this problem probably involves Froude scaling because it's about open channel flow and sluice gates, which are free surface flows.

The question has two main parts. First, calculate the head for the model given a prototype head of 20 meters. The scale is 1:20, so model is smaller than prototype. Second, find the prototype discharge when the model discharge is 0.5 m³/s.

Wait, the problem also mentions a functional relationship involving variables Q, ρ, g, h, d, μ. So the function is f(Q, ρ, g, h, d, μ) = 0. That suggests I need to use dimensional analysis to find the relevant dimensionless groups. But maybe I can bypass that by using Froude scaling directly since it's a free surface flow problem.

Froude number is Fr = V/(sqrt(gL)), where V is velocity, g is gravity, and L is a length scale. For dynamic similarity, the Froude numbers must be equal between model and prototype.

But wait, in this scenario, the head h is related to the velocity through the sluice. I think for a free jet, the velocity V is sqrt(2gh), from energy conservation (assuming negligible friction and velocity of approach). So V = sqrt(2gh).

So for model (subscript m) and prototype (p), the Froude numbers should be equal:

Fr_m = Fr_p => (V_m)/(sqrt(g L_m)) ) = (V_p)/(sqrt(g L_p)) )

But since V = sqrt(2gh), substituting that in for both model and prototype:

sqrt(2 g h_m) / sqrt(g L_m) ) = sqrt(2 g h_p) / sqrt(g L_p) )

Simplify this. The sqrt(g) cancels out in numerator and denominator. So we get:

sqrt(2 h_m) / sqrt(L_m) ) = sqrt(2 h_p) / sqrt(L_p) )

The sqrt(2) cancels on both sides. So:

sqrt(h_m)/sqrt(L_m) = sqrt(h_p)/sqrt(L_p)

Square both sides:

h_m / L_m = h_p / L_p

So h_m = h_p * (L_m / L_p )

Wait, L is the length scale, which is the same as the scale of the model. Since the model is 1:20 scale, L_m = L_p / 20. So substituting:

h_m = h_p * ( (L_p/20) / L_p ) ) => h_m = h_p / 20.

Wait no, wait. Let me recheck. Oh wait, no, the scale is model:prototype =1:20, so L_m = L_p /20.

Wait, the length scale ratio is Lm/Lp = 1/20.

So from h_m / Lm = hp / Lp,

h_m = hp * (Lm/Lp) )

Because from h_m/Lm = hp/Lp --> h_m = hp * Lm/Lp.

Since Lm/Lp is 1/20, h_m = (20 m) * (1/20) ) = 1 m.

Wait, that makes sense. So the model head is 1 meter when the prototype is 20 meters.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. I assumed V is sqrt(2gh). But maybe that's only when the head is h. Oh, right, because the velocity under a sluice gate is indeed V = sqrt(2gh), assuming the upstream depth is much larger than h, but I think that's a standard assumption here.

So first part: model head is 1 meter.

Second part: estimate the prototype discharge.

Discharge Q is area times velocity. For a sluice gate, the flow area is the area of the gate opening. Let's say the gate is a rectangular opening of width b and height d (wait, the problem says 'd' is a leading dimension of the sluice—so perhaps d is the height of the opening).

Wait, the problem says 'd' is the leading dimension. So perhaps the area is d multiplied by the width. But in the model, the width would scale down by 1/20, same as other dimensions.

So the discharge for prototype Qp is area_p * Vp, and for model Qm is area_m * Vm.

Since area scales with (length)^2, so area_m = area_p * (1/20)^2.

Velocity, from Froude scaling, Vm = Vp * (Lm/Lp)^(1/2) ? Wait, no, earlier we had Vm/Vp = sqrt( (Lm hp)/(Lp hm) )? Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, earlier we found that V is sqrt(2gh). So Vm = sqrt(2 g hm), Vp = sqrt(2 g hp). So Vm/Vp = sqrt( hm / hp ). Since hm is 1m and hp is 20m, Vm/Vp = sqrt(1/20) = 1/sqrt(20).

Wait, but wait, earlier from Froude scaling, since V scales with sqrt(g L), maybe I should have considered the velocity scale as Vm/Vp = (Lm/Lp)^(1/2) = (1/20)^(1/2) = 1/sqrt(20). Which matches the sqrt(1/20) from the velocity formula.

So Qm = Am * Vm, and Qp = Ap * Vp.

Since Am = (1/20)^2 Ap,

Qm = (1/20)^2 Ap * Vm.

But Vm = Vp / sqrt(20) as we found.

So Qm = (1/400) Ap * (Vp / sqrt(20) )

But Qp = Ap * Vp. So Qp = Ap Vp.

So let's express Qm in terms of Qp.

Qm = (1/400) * (1/sqrt(20)) * Ap Vp ) = (1/(400 * sqrt(20))) ) * Qp.

Wait, maybe it's easier to write the ratio Qp/Qm.

Qp/Qm = (Ap Vp) / (Am Vm) ) = (Ap / Am) * (Vp / Vm).

We have Ap/Am = (20)^2 = 400.

Vp/Vm is sqrt(20), because Vm = Vp / sqrt(20).

So Qp/Qm = 400 * sqrt(20) = 400 * (2*sqrt(5)) )^{0.5} ?

Wait, sqrt(20) is sqrt(4*5)=2*sqrt(5). So sqrt(20)=2 sqrt(5) ≈ 4.472.

So Qp/Qm =400 * 2 sqrt(5) )= 800 sqrt(5). Hmm, wait, wait, let me compute 400 * 2 * sqrt(5)= 800 sqrt(5). So Qp= Qm * 800 sqrt(5).

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the scaling laws. Since for Froude models, the discharge scales as Qm/Qp = (Lm/Lp)^(5/2) * (vm/vp) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should use the Froude scaling for discharge.

Wait, Froude scaling for discharge: since Q is volume per time, which is L^3 T^{-1}.

In model scaling, each dimension is scaled by Lr = Lm/Lp = 1/20.

Time scale Tr is (Lr)^(1/2} because Froude number is V/(sqrt(g L)), so V is proportional to sqrt(g L). So Vm/Vp = sqrt(Lr) = sqrt(1/20)=1/sqrt(20).

So time scale Tr = Tm / Tp = (1) / (sqrt(20)).

So for discharge Q = L^3 / T.

So Qm/Qp = (Lr)^3 / Tr = (1/20)^3 / (1/sqrt(20)) )= (1/(8000)) * sqrt(20) ) = sqrt(20)/(8000) = (2 sqrt(5))/(8000) )= sqrt(5)/(4000).

Wait, but that can't be right because earlier approach gave a different ratio. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the Froude number approach. Since the Froude number is the same, Fr_m = Fr_p.

Fr = V/(sqrt(g L)), where L is the characteristic length. Here, L could be the head h or the gate opening dimension d. I'm a bit confused about which length to use. Wait, in the problem statement, the head is h and the leading dimension is d. So perhaps for Froude scaling, the L is the same as d, assuming that the geometry is similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the length scale in Froude's law is h, the head. Because the velocity V is related to h via V= sqrt(2gh), so maybe the relevant length is h.

So then, the Froude scaling would require Fr_m = Fr_p.

Which gives Vm / sqrt(g hm) = Vp / sqrt(g hp).

Which simplifies to Vm / Vp = sqrt(hm / hp) ) = sqrt(1/20).

So Vm = Vp / sqrt(20).

Now, since discharge Q is A * V, and the area A scales as (scale factor)^2. So model area Am = (1/20)^2 Ap.

So Qm = Am * Vm = (1/400) Ap * (Vp / sqrt(20)) ).

Qp = Ap * Vp.

So Qm = (1/(400 * sqrt(20))) ) * Qp.

So Qp = Qm * (400 * sqrt(20)) ).

Compute that: 400 * sqrt(20) = 400 * 4.4721 ≈ 400 *4.4721 ≈ 1788.85.

Wait that can't be right because the options are all around 500-1000.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in scaling. Let me think again.

Another approach: Use the dimensionless groups. The function is f(Q, ρ, g, h, d, μ) = 0. So we can write this as a function of dimensionless terms.

The variables are Q, ρ, g, h, d, μ. We can use Buckingham Pi theorem to find the relevant pi terms.

But maybe for this problem, it's easier to assume that Reynolds number isn't dominant because the flow is under a sluice gate, which is a high Reynolds number situation where viscous effects are negligible. So we can neglect μ, meaning the function simplifies to f(Q, ρ, g, h, d) = 0.

So the relevant dimensionless groups can be formed. Let's try to form them.

We have variables: Q (m^3/s), ρ (kg/m^3), g (m/s²), h (m), d (m).

We need to form dimensionless groups. Let's choose ρ, g, d as recurring variables.

The function can be expressed in terms of dimensionless groups. So let's find:

Pi1 = Q / (d^2 sqrt(g d)) )

Because:

- Q has dimensions L^3 T^{-1}.
- d^2 is L^2.
- sqrt(g d) is (L^3 T^{-2} * L )^{1/2} = (L^4 T^{-2})^{1/2} = L^2 T^{-1}.

So d^2 sqrt(g d) has dimensions L^2 * L^2 T^{-1} = L^4 T^{-1}.

So Q divided by that gives (L^3 T^{-1}) )/( L^4 T^{-1} ) = 1/L, which isn't dimensionless. Hmm, maybe I should adjust.

Alternatively, another approach. Let's take variables Q, ρ, g, h, d.

The function is f(Q, ρ, g, h, d) = 0.

We can write this as Q = some function of ρ, g, h, d.

But perhaps the key is to form the Froude number, which is Fr = V/(sqrt(g L)), where V is velocity, L is length.

In this case, the velocity can be expressed as V = Q/(d * h), assuming the flow area is roughly d*h.

So V = Q/(A) where A is area = d * h (assuming d is width and h is head, but wait, no, the head is the height of the water, but the gate's opening is d, perhaps the height is d. Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, think of the area as d (width) multiplied by h (height), so A = d * h.

So V = Q/(d h).

Then Fr = V/(sqrt(g h)) ) = (Q/(d h)) ) / sqrt(g h)) = Q/(d h^(3/2) sqrt(g)).

But for dynamic similarity, Fr must be the same in model and prototype.

So (Qm)/(d_m h_m^(3/2) sqrt(g)) ) = (Qp)/(d_p h_p^(3/2) sqrt(g)) )

Since g is same for both, it cancels out.

So Qm/(d_m h_m^(3/2)) ) = Qp/(d_p h_p^(3/2)) )

Now, since the model is scaled by 1/20, d_m = d_p /20, h_m = h_p /20 (as found earlier).

So substituting:

Qm / ( (d_p/20) * (h_p/20)^(3/2) ) ) = Qp / (d_p * h_p^(3/2)) )

Simplify the denominator on the left side:

(d_p/20) * (h_p/20)^(3/2) ) = (d_p h_p^(3/2)) ) / (20 * (20)^(3/2)) )

Wait, 20^(3/2) is sqrt(20^3) )= sqrt(8000) = 20*sqrt(20).

So denominator becomes d_p h_p^(3/2) ) / (20 * 20^(3/2)) ) = d_p h_p^(3/2) ) / (20^(5/2)) )

So the equation becomes:

Qm / [ d_p h_p^(3/2) / 20^(5/2) ) ] = Qp / [d_p h_p^(3/2) ) ]

Multiply both sides by denominator:

Qm * 20^(5/2) / (d_p h_p^(3/2)) ) = Qp / (d_p h_p^(3/2)) )

Multiply both sides by (d_p h_p^(3/2)) ):

Qm * 20^(5/2) ) = Qp

So Qp = Qm * 20^(5/2)

Compute 20^(5/2): sqrt(20^5) = 20^(2) * sqrt(20) )= 400 * 4.4721 ≈ 400 *4.4721 ≈ 1788.84.

Wait, but the model discharge is given as 0.5 m³/s, so Qp = 0.5 * 1788.84 ≈ 894.42 m³/s.

Looking at the options, option E is 894 m³/s, which is very close.

So the answer should be E.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use Froude scaling, which is appropriate for free surface flows like those under a sluice gate. The Froude number is given by:

\[
Fr = \frac{V}{\sqrt{gL}}
\]

where \( V \) is the velocity, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( L \) is a characteristic length. For dynamic similarity, the Froude number must be the same for both the model and the prototype.

### Step 1: Determine the model head
The model scale is \( 1:20 \), so the head in the model (\( h_m \)) is related to the prototype head (\( h_p = 20 \, \text{m} \)) by:

\[
\frac{h_m}{h_p} = \frac{L_m}{L_p} = \frac{1}{20}
\]

Thus:

\[
h_m = \frac{h_p}{20} = \frac{20}{20} = 1 \, \text{m}
\]

The model head is \( 1 \, \text{m} \).

### Step 2: Relate model and prototype discharge
The discharge \( Q \) is related to the velocity \( V \) and the flow area \( A \). For a rectangular sluice gate, the flow area scales as \( A_m / A_p = (L_m / L_p)^2 = (1/20)^2 = 1/400 \). The velocity scales as \( V_m / V_p = \sqrt{L_m / L_p} = \sqrt{1/20} \). Therefore, the discharge scales as:

\[
\frac{Q_m}{Q_p} = \frac{A_m}{A_p} \cdot \frac{V_m}{V_p} = \frac{1}{400} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{20}}
\]

\[
Q_p = Q_m \cdot 400 \cdot \sqrt{20}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the prototype discharge
Given \( Q_m = 0.5 \, \text{m}^3/\text{s} \), we calculate:

\[
Q_p = 0.5 \cdot 400 \cdot \sqrt{20}
\]

\[
\sqrt{20} \approx 4.472
\]

\[
Q_p = 0.5 \cdot 400 \cdot 4.472 \approx 0.5 \cdot 1788.8 \approx 894 \, \text{m}^3/\text{s}
\]

### Final Answer
The discharge from the prototype dam is approximately \( 894 \, \text{m}^3/\text{s} \), which corresponds to option **E**.
