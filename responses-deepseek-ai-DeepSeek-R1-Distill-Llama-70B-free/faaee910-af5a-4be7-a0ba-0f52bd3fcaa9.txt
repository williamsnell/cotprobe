Question:

Suppose there is a correlation of r = 0.9 between number of hours per day students study and GPAs. Which of the following is a reasonable conclusion?

Options:

A: 90% of the variation in number of study hours per day can be explained by variation in GPAs.
B: If a student studies less, their GPA will always decrease.
C: 90% of students who study receive high grades.
D: 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.
E: The correlation between number of hours studied per day and GPA is not significant.
F: 81% of students who study receive high grades.
G: 90% of students who study a lot receive low grades.
H: 90% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by variation in number of study hours per day.
I: If a student studies more, their GPA will always increase.
J: 90% of students who receive high grades study a lot.

Okay, so I have this question about correlation and I need to figure out which conclusion is reasonable based on the given data. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the correlation r is 0.9 between the number of hours students study per day and their GPAs. I remember that correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. The value of r ranges from -1 to +1. A positive r means a positive relationship, so as study hours increase, GPA does too. 

Now, the value here is 0.9, which is a strong positive correlation because it's close to 1. But wait, correlation doesn't imply causation. So even though there's a strong relationship, it doesn't mean that studying more causes higher GPAs. There could be other factors involved.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 90% of the variation in study hours can be explained by GPA variation. Hmm, wait. The coefficient of determination is r squared. If r is 0.9, then r squared is 0.81 or 81%. But does this apply to GPA or study hours? I think it's the other variable. Since the correlation is between study hours and GPA, the variation in GPA explained by study hours would be 81%, not the other way around. So A says 90% of study hours are explained by GPA, which isn't right. So A is incorrect.

Option B: If a student studies less, GPA will always decrease. That sounds too absolute. Correlation shows a trend, but it's not a guarantee. There are probably exceptions. So B is making a universal statement which isn't supported by correlation data. So B is incorrect.

Option C: 90% of students who study receive high grades. The 0.9 correlation doesn't translate into percentages of students. It's about the strength of the relationship, not the proportion of students. So C is not correct.

Option D: 81% of variation in GPAs explained by study hours. Oh wait, because r is 0.9, r squared is 0.81, so 81%. So this would mean that 81% of the variance in GPA is accounted for by study hours. That sounds right. So D is a possible correct choice.

Option E: The correlation isn't significant. But r = 0.9 is a very high value, so it's likely statistically significant. So E is incorrect.

Option F: 81% of students who study get high grades. Again, this is about students, but the 0.81 is about variance, not the number of students. So F is incorrect.

Option G: 90% of students who study a lot get low grades. This contradicts the positive correlation. If r is positive, studying more is associated with higher GPAs, so G is wrong.

Option H: 90% of GPA variation explained by study hours. Wait, 0.9 squared is 0.81, which is 81%. So H says 90%, which is incorrect because 0.9 is r, not r squared. So H is wrong.

Option I: If a student studies more, GPA will always increase. Again, this is an absolute statement. Correlation doesn't mean every case follows; it's a trend. So I is incorrect.

Option J: 90% of high grade students study a lot. This is making a claim about the proportion of students with high grades who study a lot. But the correlation doesn't give information about proportions of students, only the strength of the relationship between variables. So J is incorrect.

So looking back, the correct option is D because it correctly states that 81% of the variation in GPAs is explained by study hours, which matches r squared.

The correlation coefficient \( r = 0.9 \) indicates a strong positive relationship between the number of hours students study per day and their GPAs. This means that as study hours increase, GPAs tend to increase as well. The coefficient of determination, \( r^2 \), is calculated as \( 0.9^2 = 0.81 \), which means that 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by the variation in study hours. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. It reverses the relationship, claiming that 90% of the variation in study hours is explained by GPA, which is not supported by the data.
- **B**: Incorrect. Correlation does not imply causation, and it is not a guarantee that studying less will always lead to a lower GPA.
- **C**: Incorrect. The correlation does not provide information about the percentage of students who study and receive high grades.
- **D**: Correct. \( r^2 = 0.81 \) means that 81% of the variation in GPAs can be explained by the variation in study hours.
- **E**: Incorrect. A correlation of \( r = 0.9 \) is highly significant.
- **F**: Incorrect. The 81% refers to the variation explained, not the percentage of students.
- **G**: Incorrect. This contradicts the positive correlation, as studying more is associated with higher GPAs.
- **H**: Incorrect. It incorrectly states 90% instead of 81% of the variation in GPAs being explained by study hours.
- **I**: Incorrect. Correlation does not imply a universal causal relationship.
- **J**: Incorrect. The correlation does not provide information about the percentage of high-achieving students who study a lot.

The correct answer is **D**, as it accurately reflects the relationship described by the correlation coefficient.

Answer: D
