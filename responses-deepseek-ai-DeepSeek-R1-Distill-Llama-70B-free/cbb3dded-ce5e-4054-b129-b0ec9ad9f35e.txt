Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about Thomas Hill's perspective on environmental ethics. Hmm, I remember that Hill has some specific arguments about why destroying the environment is wrong, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let's think this through.

The question says that instead of asking why the act of destroying the environment might be immoral, Hill wants to ask a different question. So the options are about what alternative question he's posing.

From what I recall, Hill discusses the moral considerations regarding the environment. I think he argues against the idea that people are bad if they destroy the environment. Wait, was it that he doesn't focus on the character of the people but rather on the act itself? Or maybe he's more concerned with the impact on future generations.

Wait, no, I think Hill is critical of a certain approach. He might be saying that instead of judging people as bad for destroying the environment, we should consider the inherent value of nature. Or perhaps he wants to shift the focus from the immorality of the act to something else.

Wait, another angle: I remember reading that Hill argues that the question shouldn't be about whether people who destroy the environment are bad (which would be option G), but instead about whether the act itself is wrong because it disregards the value of nature. So instead of looking at the moral character of the person, he looks at the act's inherent wrongness.

Looking at the options, the original question is about why destroying the environment is immoral. So Hill is suggesting a different angle. Let me go through the options.

Option A: How the decision to preserve benefits the environment. That seems more about the positive effects, not the moral question.

Option B: How destruction affects the economy. That's more economic impact, not directly about morality.

Option C: Why people who preserve might be good. That's about the moral character of people, which I think Hill is moving away from.

Option D: How destruction affects future generations. That's a consequentialist approach, focusing on the impact on others. Possible.

Option E: Why destroying nature might be immoral. Wait, that's the same as the original question. So the opposite of what Hill is doing.

Option F: Whether plants have interests. That's about the interests of non-human entities, which relates to their moral standing.

Option G: Why people who destroy might be bad. Again, this is about the person's character, which I think Hill is moving away from.

Option H: If it's legally punishable. That's about law, not morality.

Option I: Whether nature has a right to exist. That's about rights, which is a different angle.

Option J: Whether animals have rights. Similar to I, but specific to animals.

Wait, I think Hill's argument is that we should consider the intrinsic value of nature. So perhaps he's asking whether nature itself has rights or interests, rather than focusing on human morality.

Alternatively, I've heard that Hill critiques the "arrogance" of humans thinking they can manipulate nature without considering nature's own value. He argues that destroying the environment is wrong not just because it's bad for humans or future generations, but because nature has inherent worth.

So looking again, the original question is about the immorality of the act. Hill wants to ask something else. So perhaps he's asking whether nature has a right to exist (option I) or whether plants have interests (option F). Alternatively, maybe he's focusing on the impact on future generations (option D).

I'm a bit torn. Let me try to recall more precisely. I think Hill's point is that we should consider the environment's intrinsic value, so the question would shift to whether nature has rights. So option I would be about nature's rights, while option F is about plants' interests.

Alternatively, another angle: Hill argues that the question isn't about whether people are good or bad (so not option G or C) but about the act's immorality because it disregards the value of natural things. So perhaps he's asking whether nature has a right to exist, which would be option I.

Wait, but I remember that Hill talks about the Aldo Leopold land ethic, which extends ethical consideration to the land itself. So maybe the question is about whether nature has rights.

Alternatively, the question might be about the impact on future generations, but I'm not sure if that's Hill's focus.

I think the correct answer is option I: whether nature has a right to exist. Because Hill is concerned with the intrinsic value of nature, not just the consequences for humans or the character of the people involved.

The question revolves around Thomas Hill's perspective on environmental ethics, specifically his alternative approach to understanding the morality of environmental destruction. Hill argues against focusing on the moral character of individuals who destroy the environment and instead emphasizes the intrinsic value of nature itself. This shifts the inquiry from the immorality of the act to whether nature has inherent rights or interests.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, G, H, J**: These options focus on economic impacts, human moral character, or legal frameworks, which do not align with Hill's emphasis on nature's intrinsic value.
- **D**: While considering future generations is a valid perspective, it is more consequentialist and does not directly address the intrinsic value of nature.
- **E**: This is the original question Hill seeks to move away from.
- **F**: This touches on non-human interests but is narrower, focusing on plants.
- **I**: This directly addresses the intrinsic value and rights of nature, aligning with Hill's argument.

Thus, Hill's alternative question is about whether nature has a right to exist, reflecting his concern for nature's inherent worth.
