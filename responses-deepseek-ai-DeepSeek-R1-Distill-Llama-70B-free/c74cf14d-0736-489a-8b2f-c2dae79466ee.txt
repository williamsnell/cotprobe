Okay, so I've got this fluid mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about a liquid flowing past a flat plate. The given parameters are the density (rho) as 62.4 lb/ft³, the dynamic viscosity (mu) as 7.5e-4 lb/ft·s, and the free-stream velocity is 12 ft/s. The point in question is 2 inches from the leading edge of the plate. They're asking for three things: the laminar boundary layer thickness, the shear stress, and the shear force per unit width up to that point.

Hmm, I remember that for boundary layer problems, the Reynolds number is crucial. The Reynolds number tells us whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. Since the question specifies the laminar boundary layer, I can assume we're in the laminar regime here.

Wait, but wait. The Reynolds number for the flow along the plate up to a certain point x is given by Re_x = (rho * U * x) / mu. If Re_x is less than about 500,000, the flow is laminar. Let me check what Re_x is here.

First, I need to make sure all the units are consistent. The distance x is given as 2 inches, which I should convert to feet because the other units are in feet. 2 inches is 2/12 = 0.1667 feet.

So, Re_x = (62.4 lb/ft³) * (12 ft/s) * (0.1667 ft) / (7.5e-4 lb/ft·s).

Let me calculate this. 

Numerator: 62.4 * 12 = 748.8, then 748.8 * 0.1667 ≈ 748.8 * 0.1667 ≈ 124.8 (since 748.8 * 0.1 is 74.88, 0.06 is 44.928, 0.0067 is about 5.0; total around 124.8). 

Denominator: 7.5e-4 = 0.00075.

So Re_x ≈ 124.8 / 0.00075 ≈ 166,400. Wait, no, wait: 124.8 divided by 0.00075. Let me compute that more accurately. 124.8 / 0.00075 = 124800 / 0.75 = 166,400. So Re_x is approximately 166,400, which is less than 500,000, so yes, laminar flow. Good.

Now, the first part is the boundary layer thickness. I think the formula for the laminar boundary layer thickness (delta) is given by delta = (5 * mu) / (rho * U) * sqrt(Re_x). Wait, wait, let me recall the exact formula. I think it's delta = (5 * mu) / (rho * U) * sqrt(Re_x) but maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, another formula comes to mind: delta = (4.96 * x) / sqrt(Re_x). Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Oh wait, the exact formula is delta = (5 * x) / (sqrt(Re_x)) * (1/ (sqrt(Re_x)) ). Wait, no, perhaps I should remember that for a flat plate, the boundary layer thickness in laminar flow is given by delta = (5 * nu * x) / (U * sqrt(Re_x)). Wait, no, maybe I should look up the correct formula.

Wait, another approach. I recall that for a flat plate with laminar flow, the boundary layer thickness can be found using the approximate formula delta = (5 * x) / (Re_x^(1/2)) * (1/ (something)). Alternatively, the formula is delta = (4.96 * x) / sqrt(Re_x). Let me check the derivation.

The boundary layer thickness for laminar flow over a flat plate is given by delta = (5 * nu * x)/(U * sqrt(Re_x)). Wait, let's see. The Reynolds number Re_x is (rho U x)/mu. So nu is mu/rho, so nu = mu/(rho). Therefore, substituting, delta = (5 * (mu/rho) * x ) / (U * sqrt(Re_x)).

But since Re_x = (rho U x)/mu, then sqrt(Re_x) = sqrt( (rho U x)/mu ). Let me substitute this into the delta equation.

delta = (5 * (mu/rho) * x ) / (U * sqrt( (rho U x)/mu )) )

Let me simplify this expression step by step.

First, numerator: 5 * (mu/rho) * x.

Denominator: U * sqrt( (rho U x)/mu )

Let me write it as [U * sqrt(rho U x / mu) ].

So delta = [5 mu x / rho ] / [ U * sqrt( (rho U x)/mu ) ]

Let me square the denominator's term:

sqrt( (rho U x)/mu ) = [ (rho U x) / mu ) ]^(1/2) 

So denominator becomes U * [ (rho U x)/mu ) ]^(1/2)

Putting it all together:

delta = (5 mu x / rho ) / [ U * ( (rho U x)/mu )^(1/2) ) ]

Let me separate the terms:

Multiply numerator and denominator:

Denominator: U * (rho U x/mu)^(1/2) 

So,

delta = [5 mu x / rho ] / [ U * (rho U x/mu)^(1/2) ) ]

Let me write this as 5 mu x / [ rho * U * (rho U x/mu)^(1/2) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute by substituting the values directly.

Alternatively, I've heard that a simpler formula is delta = (5 x) / (Re_x^(1/2)) when Re_x is based on x, but I'm not 100% sure. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The boundary layer thickness for a flat plate in laminar flow can be approximated by delta = (4.96 * x) / sqrt(Re_x). I think that's the formula I remember.

So with Re_x =166,400, sqrt(Re_x) = sqrt(166400) ≈ let's calculate that.

What's sqrt(166400)? Let's see, 408^2 is 166,464 (because 400^2=160,000; 408^2= (400+8)^2=400² + 2*400*8 +8²=160000 + 6400 +64=166464). So sqrt(166400) is just a bit less than 408, maybe 407.8 or so.

But perhaps for simplicity, I can approximate it as 408.

So delta = (4.96 * x) / 408, where x is in feet.

Wait, x is 0.1667 feet.

So delta = (4.96 * 0.1667) / 408.

Compute numerator: 4.96 * 0.1667 ≈ let's calculate.

4 * 0.1667 is 0.6668, 0.96 * 0.1667 is approximately 0.16, so total ≈ 0.6668 + 0.16 = 0.8268.

So numerator is about 0.8268.

Denominator is 408.

So delta ≈ 0.8268 / 408 ≈ approximately 0.002027 feet. Let me do it more accurately.

408 * 0.002 = 0.816. 0.002027 *408= 0.8268. So yes, about 0.002027 ft.

Wait, but the formula I'm using is delta = (4.96 x) / sqrt(Re_x). Let me confirm if that's correct. Oh wait, wait, another thought. Another formula I found earlier was delta = (5 nu x)/(U sqrt(Re_x)). Let me try that as well.

nu = mu/rho = (7.5e-4 lb/ft-s) / (62.4 lb/ft³) = (7.5e-4) / 62.4 = let's compute that.

7.5e-4 is 0.00075. 0.00075 /62.4 = approximately 1.203e-5 ft²/s.

So nu = 1.203e-5 ft²/s.

Then, (5 * nu * x) / (U * sqrt(Re_x)).

Compute numerator: 5 * 1.203e-5 * 0.1667 ≈ 5 * 1.203e-5 = 6.015e-5, times 0.1667 ≈ 1.0025e-5.

Denominator: U * sqrt(Re_x) = 12 ft/s * 408 ≈ 4896.

So delta = 1.0025e-5 / 4896 ≈ approx 2.046e-9 ft? That can't be right, because earlier I got 0.002 ft. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the substitution. Let me recheck the formula. I think the correct formula is delta = (5 * nu * x) / (U * sqrt(Re_x)).

Wait, but substituting the numbers gives me a tiny value, which contradicts the earlier approach. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is delta = (4.96 x) / sqrt(Re_x). Let me stick with that for now, as it gives a reasonable value.

Wait, so 4.96 * 0.1667 ≈ 0.826 feet. Then divided by 408 gives about 0.002027 ft, which is 0.00203 ft, or approximately 0.002 ft.

Looking at the options, option C has a) 0.002 ft. Option A has 0.0022 ft, and option F is 0.0028 ft. So perhaps the correct is around 0.002 ft.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately. Let me get the exact Re_x.

Re_x = (rho * U * x) / mu.

rho =62.4 lb/ft³, U=12 ft/s, x=0.1667 ft, mu=7.5e-4 lb/ft·s.

So Re_x = (62.4 *12 *0.1667 ) / (7.5e-4 )

Compute numerator: 62.4 *12 = 748.8, 748.8 *0.1667 ≈ let's compute 748.8 * 0.1667:

0.1 *748.8 =74.88

0.06 *748.8 =44.928

0.0067 *748.8 ≈ 5.01296

Adding these: 74.88 +44.928=119.808 +5.01296≈124.82096.

So numerator is approximately 124.821.

Denominator is 7.5e-4 =0.00075.

Re_x=124.821 / 0.00075 = 166,428. (since 124.821 /0.00075: 124.821 * (1/0.00075) = 124.821 * 1333.333... ≈ 166,428.)

So Re_x≈166,428.

Now, sqrt(Re_x)=sqrt(166428)=approx 407.85.

So, delta=4.96 *x / sqrt(Re_x) = 4.96 *0.1667 /407.85.

Compute numerator: 4.96 *0.1667 = 0.8267.

Divide by 407.85: 0.8267 /407.85 ≈ 0.002027 ft.

So approximately 0.00203 ft, which is 0.0020 ft when rounded to three decimal places. So option C is a) 0.002 ft. Option A is 0.0022 ft, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise formula. Another thought: The exact solution for the laminar boundary layer gives delta as (5 x)/(Re_x^(1/2)) * (1/ (sqrt(5))) ? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is different.

Wait, I think the correct formula for delta in laminar flow over a flat plate is delta = (5 x)/(sqrt(Re_x)) * (1/ (something)).

Wait, let me recall the exact formula. The Blasius solution for the boundary layer on a flat plate gives the boundary layer thickness as delta = (5 nu x)/(U sqrt(Re_x)). Wait, but I think that was the formula I tried earlier, but it gave a very small number. Let me try that again.

nu = mu/rho = (7.5e-4 lb/ft-s) / (62.4 lb/ft³) = 7.5e-4 /62.4 = approx 1.2028e-5 ft²/s.

So, (5 * nu * x ) = 5 * 1.2028e-5 * 0.1667 ≈ 5 *1.2028e-5 =6.014e-5, times 0.1667≈1.002e-5.

Denominator: U * sqrt(Re_x) =12 * 407.85≈4898.2.

So delta =1.002e-5 /4898.2≈2.045e-9 ft. That's way too small, which doesn't make sense. So I'm definitely making a mistake in applying the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is delta = (5 x) / (Re_x^(1/2)) multiplied by something else. Let me look it up in my notes or a textbook. Oh wait, I can't access that right now.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the boundary layer thickness is delta = (5 x) / (sqrt(Re_x)) * (1/ (something)). Or perhaps I'm confusing it with the momentum thickness.

Wait, no, another approach: The Prandtl-Blasius solution gives delta = (5 x)/(sqrt(Re_x)) * (1/ (sqrt(5)))? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps it's delta = (4.96 x) / sqrt(Re_x). Let me stick with that.

So with x=0.1667 ft, Re_x=166,428, sqrt(Re_x)=407.85.

So delta=4.96 *0.1667 /407.85 = (4.96 *0.1667)=0.8267, divided by 407.85 gives 0.002027 ft, which is approximately 0.00203 ft.

So option C has a) 0.002 ft, which is close. Option A is 0.0022, which is a bit higher. So perhaps the correct answer is option C for part a.

Now, moving on to part b) the shear stress. Shear stress at the wall in laminar flow is given by tau = (mu * U) / (delta) * (something). Or wait, another formula: tau = (mu * U) / (delta) ? No, perhaps I need to recall the correct formula.

Wait, the shear stress at the wall for a laminar boundary layer is given by tau = (mu * U) / (delta) * (dU/dy|_{y=0}), but I think the Blasius solution gives the wall shear stress as tau = 0.332 * (rho * U^2) / (sqrt(Re_x)).

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The formula for wall shear stress in laminar boundary layer is tau = (mu * U) / (delta) * (df/deta|_{eta=0}), where df/deta is the derivative of the Blasius function at eta=0. For the Blasius solution, the skin friction coefficient is Cf = (2 mu U)/(rho U^2 x) ) * (dU/dy at wall). Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that the shear stress is given by tau = (mu * U) / (delta) * (derivative of the velocity profile at the wall).

Alternatively, the skin friction coefficient is Cf = tau/(0.5 rho U^2) = 0.664 / sqrt(Re_x).

Wait, that seems familiar. So, tau = 0.5 rho U^2 * Cf. Since Cf = 0.664 / sqrt(Re_x), so tau = 0.5 rho U^2 * (0.664 / sqrt(Re_x)).

Let me compute that.

Compute Cf first: 0.664 / sqrt(166428) = 0.664 /407.85 ≈0.001628.

Then, tau = 0.5 *62.4 lb/ft³*(12 ft/s)^2 * 0.001628.

Calculate step by step:

12^2=144.

0.5 *62.4=31.2.

31.2 *144=31.2 *144. Let's compute 30*144=4320, 1.2*144=172.8, so total 4320+172.8=4492.8.

Now multiply by 0.001628: 4492.8 *0.001628.

Well, 4492.8 *0.001 =4.4928, 4492.8 *0.0006=2.69568, 4492.8 *0.000028=0.1258.

Adding them up: 4.4928 +2.69568=7.18848 +0.1258≈7.31428.

Wait, wait, no. Because 0.001628 is 0.001 +0.0006 +0.000028.

Wait, let me compute 0.001628 *4492.8.

Alternatively, 4492.8 *0.001628 =4492.8 *1.628e-3 = (4492.8 *1.628) *1e-3.

Compute 4492.8 *1.628:

Let's approximate:

4492.8 *1.6=7,186.08.

4492.8 *0.028=125.7984.

Total≈7186.08 +125.7984≈7311.8784.

Multiply by 1e-3:7.3118784 lb/ft².

Wait, that's approximately 7.31 lb/ft². But looking at the answer options, the
