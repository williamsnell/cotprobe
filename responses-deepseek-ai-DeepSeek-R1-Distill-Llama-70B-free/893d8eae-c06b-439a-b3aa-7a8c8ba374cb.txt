Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about stable isotopes and their use in measuring total body water. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is asking which stable isotope is commonly given for measuring total body water. The options are from A to J. 

Let me think about what I remember. I know that isotopes are variants of elements with different numbers of neutrons. Stable isotopes don't undergo radioactive decay, which makes them safe for use in biological studies.

Water in the body is H2O, so the isotopes involved would be of hydrogen or oxygen. I remember that deuterium is a heavy isotope of hydrogen. Deuterium has one proton and one neutron, unlike regular hydrogen which has just a proton. So deuterium is H²H or D.

Oxygen has some stable isotopes too. Oxygen-16 is the most common, but there's also Oxygen-18, which is heavier. I think sometimes O-18 is used in studies, but I'm not sure for what exactly.

Now, the method for measuring body water... I remember something about using a tracer. The idea is that you give a person a known amount of a stable isotope, and then measure how it distributes in the body. Since water is everywhere in the body, the dilution of the isotope can help determine the total water volume.

Deuterium oxide (D2O) is often used, I think. When someone drinks D2O, the deuterium spreads throughout all the water in their body. Then, by measuring the concentration of deuterium in body fluids, you can calculate the total amount of water. So the isotope here would be deuterium, which is a form of hydrogen.

Looking at the options, option J is Deuterium. That makes sense. I don't think it's Oxygen-18 because I remember that being used more in things like tracking water sources or in paleoclimate studies, not so much for body water measurement.

Wait, another thought. I've heard that sometimes both deuterium and oxygen-18 are used as tracers in water. But when it comes to specifically measuring total body water, I think deuterium is the standard. Because each water molecule has two hydrogen atoms, there's more opportunity for the tracer to dilute evenly.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be Deuterium, which is option J.

The measurement of total body water often involves the use of stable isotopes as tracers. Among the options provided, deuterium (a heavy isotope of hydrogen) is the most commonly used for this purpose. When deuterium oxide (D₂O) is administered, the deuterium distributes throughout the body's water compartments. By measuring the dilution of deuterium in body fluids, the total body water can be accurately determined. This method is widely recognized as the standard approach for such measurements.

Other isotopes, such as Oxygen-18, are used in different contexts, like tracking water sources or paleoclimate studies, but deuterium is specifically favored for its effectiveness in measuring total body water due to its integration into water molecules (H₂O). Therefore, the correct answer is deuterium.

Answer: J
