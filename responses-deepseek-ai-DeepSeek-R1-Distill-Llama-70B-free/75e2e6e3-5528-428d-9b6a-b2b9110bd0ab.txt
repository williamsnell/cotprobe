Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this probability problem here. Let's see, the question is about rolling two dice and calculating the expected gain or loss per game. Hmm, I remember that expected value is like the average outcome if you were to play the game many times. 

Alright, let's break this down. The game works like this: you roll two dice. If both show a 6, you win $20. Otherwise, you lose the game. It costs $2 to play. So I need to find out whether on average the player gains or loses money, and how much.

First, I should find the probability of winning. Each die has 6 faces, so when rolling two dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6 * 6 = 36. Right? Because each die is independent. 

Now, the winning condition is both dice showing 6. There's only one outcome where both are six: (6,6). So the probability of winning is 1 out of 36. So that's 1/36. To get the decimal, I think 1 divided by 36 is approximately 0.02778, or about 2.78%.

Next, the probability of losing must be the complement of that. So 1 minus 1/36 is 35/36, which is about 0.9722 or 97.22%. 

Now, the payouts. If you win, you get $20, but it cost $2 to play. Wait, does the $20 include getting your $2 back, or is it profit? Hmm, the question says "wins $20", so I think that's the net gain. Because when you play, you pay $2 to play, so if you win, you gain $20, but you also lose the $2 cost if you lose. Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The cost is separate. So when you play, you pay $2 regardless. Then, if you win, you gain $20. If you lose, you don't get anything back, so your net is -$2. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The problem says, "it costs $2.00 to play the game." So that's the cost to play, and then depending on the outcome, you either win $20 or lose. But does losing mean you just lose the $2, or do you lose more? The wording says, "otherwise the player loses the game." So I think losing the game means you don't get any money back beyond the cost. So your net gain is -$2 in that case.

Wait, no, maybe. Let me read it again. "If both dice show 6, then the player wins $20; otherwise the player loses the game." So when you lose, you lose the game, which I think means you lose the amount you paid to play. So the cost is $2, so if you lose, your net is -$2. If you win, your net is +$20, because you paid $2 and got $20, so net $18? Or is the $20 including the cost? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. 

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: the expected payout is $20 when you win, and $0 when you lose, but you have to subtract the cost to play each time. Because the cost is $2 each game, regardless of outcome. So the expected value would be the probability of winning times the payout, plus the probability of losing times losing amount, then subtract the cost.

Wait, another approach: the net gain is (payout - cost) when you win, and (-cost) when you lose. Or is the payout in addition to the cost? Let me think about it.

Alternatively, the expected value (EV) formula is:

EV = (probability of winning) * (amount won) + (probability of losing) * (amount lost)

But in this context, the cost to play is a fixed loss regardless. So perhaps it's better to structure it as:

Each game, you pay $2 to play. Then, with probability 1/36, you gain $20, and with 35/36, you gain nothing. So your net gain is the payout minus the cost.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's model it correctly.

The expected gain per game is calculated as:

EV = (probability of winning) * (winnings) + (probability of losing) * (loss) - cost to play.

Wait, no. Because the cost is paid every time you play. So each game, you're spending $2, regardless of the outcome. So the net gain when you win would be $20 (winnings) minus the $2 (cost), giving a net of $18. When you lose, you just lose the $2 cost, so net is -$2.

Wait, does that make sense? Or perhaps the $20 is profit, meaning that the $2 cost is already considered. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as:

When you play, you pay $2. Then, if you win, you get $20 (so net gain is $20 - $2 = $18). If you lose, you get nothing, so net gain is -$2.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Because the way the problem is phrased, you pay $2 to play, and then you either win $20 or lose (i.e., get nothing). So the net gain would be:

If you win: $20 (winnings) - $2 (cost) = $18 profit.

If you lose: -$2 (because you paid $2 and got nothing).

Alternatively, another way: the expected value is calculated as the sum of (probability * payout) minus the cost.

Because the cost is separate. So the expected payout from the game itself is (1/36)*20 + (35/36)*0 = 20/36 ≈ 0.5556.

Then, since you pay $2 to play, the expected net gain is 0.5556 - 2 = -1.4444 dollars.

Which is approximately -$1.44 per game. So the expected loss is about $1.44.

Looking at the options, option A says the player will lose about $1.44. Option C is about $0.89 loss, which doesn't match. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure.

Probability of winning: 1/36 ≈ 0.027778.

Payout when win: $20.

Payout when lose: $0.

So expected payout from the game is 20*(1/36) + 0*(35/36) = 20/36 ≈ 0.5556.

Cost to play is $2, so net gain per game is 0.5556 - 2 = -1.4444.

So yes, that's approximately -$1.44. So the player loses about $1.44 per game on average.

Looking back at the options, option A matches this.

To determine the expected gain or loss per game, we calculate the expected value (EV) of the game. The game involves rolling two dice, and the outcomes are as follows:

1. **Winning Condition**: If both dice show 6, the player wins $20.  
   - Probability of winning: \( \frac{1}{36} \) (since there is only 1 favorable outcome out of 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice).  
   - Payout when winning: $20.

2. **Losing Condition**: If the dice do not both show 6, the player loses the game.  
   - Probability of losing: \( \frac{35}{36} \) (the complement of the winning probability).  
   - Payout when losing: $0.

The cost to play the game is $2, which is paid regardless of the outcome. The expected value is calculated as:

\[
\text{EV} = (\text{Probability of Winning} \times \text{Payout when Winning}) + (\text{Probability of Losing} \times \text{Payout when Losing}) - \text{Cost to Play}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{EV} = \left(\frac{1}{36} \times 20\right) + \left(\frac{35}{36} \times 0\right) - 2
\]

\[
\text{EV} = \frac{20}{36} - 2
\]

\[
\text{EV} \approx 0.5556 - 2 = -1.4444
\]

Thus, the expected loss per game is approximately $1.44. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A: The player will lose about $1.44.**
