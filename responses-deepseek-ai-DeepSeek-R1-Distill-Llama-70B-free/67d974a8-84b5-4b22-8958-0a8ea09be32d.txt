Okay, so I've got this question about monopsony, and I need to figure out which option correctly identifies a monopsonist. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, monopsony is a market structure where there's only one buyer of a particular product or service. In the context of labor, that would mean one buyer of labor services. So, in a regular competitive market, there are many buyers and sellers, right? But monopsony is the oppositeâ€”only one buyer.

Wait, so the question is asking which option identifies a monopsonist. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A says a wage payment lower than the average revenue product of labor. Hmm, average revenue product (ARP) is like the revenue generated per worker. In a competitive market, I remember that firms pay workers according to their marginal revenue product (MRP), and under monopsony, the wage is lower than MRP. But I'm not sure how ARP plays into this. Maybe it's a distractor.

Option B: Employment level lower than competitive. I think that's correct because a monopsonist would hire fewer workers than a competitive market. Because they're the only buyer, they can set the wage, and they'll choose where MRP equals MFC (marginal factor cost), which is lower than the competitive level where MRP equals the wage.

Option C: Single buyer of labor services. Oh wait, that's exactly what a monopsonist is. So this seems right. But let me check the other options to make sure.

Option D: Employment higher than competitive. No, that's the opposite. Monopsony reduces employment compared to the competitive case.

Option E: Wage lower than MRP. Oh yes, I remember that in monopsony, the wage is less than the MRP because the firm has market power. So they pay less than the value the worker brings. So this is a characteristic, but the question is about identifying a monopsonist. So E is a result, not the definition.

Option F: Wage equal to competitive. No, because in competitive markets, wage equals MRP, but in monopsony, it's lower.

Option G: Wage higher than competitive. No, that doesn't make sense; monopsonists pay less.

Option H: Multiple seller. Wait, no, monopsony is one buyer, so multiple sellers would be on the selling side, which is the case here. So H refers to the sellers, but monopsony is about the buyer side.

Option I: Employment equal. No, because as B says, it's lower.

Option J: Single seller. Wait, no, that's monopoly. Monopsony is single buyer, so J is about the seller side, which is different.

So looking back, the question is what identifies a monopsonist. So the correct answer would be C, because a monopsonist is a single buyer of labor. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought some of the other options describe the outcomes, but the question is about identification.

Wait, the question says "is identified by one of the following." So it's looking for the definition. So the single buyer is the identifier. So option C is correct.

But wait, I also remember that in monopsony, the firm's MFC (which is the supply curve) is higher than the wage because they have to pay more to attract more workers. So they set where MRP equals MFC, which is lower than the competitive quantity. So the employment level is lower than competitive, which is option B. So is that also an identifier?

Hmm, maybe both C and B are identifiers. But the question is giving options, and I have to pick the correct one. The question is phrased as "is identified by one of the following." So which one is the defining characteristic.

I think the defining characteristic is that a monopsonist is a single buyer. So option C. Because, without being a single buyer, you can't have the other effects like lower employment or lower wages. So the identifier is being a single buyer.

Yes, I think C is the correct answer.

A monopsonist is identified by being a single buyer of labor services. This is the defining characteristic of monopsony, as it describes the market structure where there is only one buyer in the labor market. While other options, such as lower employment levels or wages below the marginal revenue product, are outcomes of monopsony, they are not the defining feature. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: A single buyer of labor services.
