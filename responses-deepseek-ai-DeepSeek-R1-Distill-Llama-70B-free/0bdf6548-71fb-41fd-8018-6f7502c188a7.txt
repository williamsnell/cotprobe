Okay, so I've got this geography question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about someone planning to move from their hometown to Pittsburgh but stops in Columbus, Ohio, visits a relative, and ends up loving the city so much they decide to stay there instead. The question is asking what this scenario is an example of, with options from A to J.

Hmm, I remember from my classes that migration patterns have different terms. Let me think through each option.

Option A is intervening opportunity. I think this is when something along the way stops you from reaching your original destination. Like, if you're moving to Pittsburgh but find a great job in Columbus, so you stay there. That sounds exactly like what's happening here.

Option B is periodic movement. That's more like seasonal movements, like migrating for work and then returning home. Not really the case here since the person is settling permanently.

Option C is forced migration. That's when you're made to leave, like refugees. The person here chose to stay, so no.

Option D is distance decay. That refers to how interaction between places decreases with distance. Not relevant here.

Option E is push-pull factors. These are the reasons why people leave (push) or are attracted (pull) to a place. While they fell in love with Columbus, the question is more about the process of stopping along the way.

Option F is step migration. I think that's moving in stages, like from a rural area to a nearby city, then to a bigger one. Maybe not exactly this situation.

Option G is involuntary migration. Again, that's forced, so no.

Option H is transnational migration. That's moving across national borders, which isn't the case here.

Option I is cyclical movement. Like commuting or seasonal moves, which doesn't fit.

Option J is chain migration. That's when people follow others from their place of origin, leading to a chain. The question mentions visiting a relative, so maybe that's a factor, but the main point is the stop along the way.

Wait, the key here is that the move to Pittsburgh was planned, but an intervening opportunity (Columbus) caused them to stay. So intervening opportunity is when an attractive option along the migration route causes the migrant to stop before reaching the original destination.

So the correct answer should be A: intervening opportunity.

The scenario describes a situation where an individual initially plans to move to Pittsburgh but stops in Columbus, Ohio, discovers opportunities there, and decides to stay. This aligns with the concept of **intervening opportunity**, which occurs when an attractive option along the migration route causes the migrant to stop short of their original destination.

- **A: intervening opportunity** fits perfectly as the individual was drawn to Columbus due to its appeal.
- Other options like **push-pull factors** or **chain migration** are relevant but not the primary concept here.

Answer: A
