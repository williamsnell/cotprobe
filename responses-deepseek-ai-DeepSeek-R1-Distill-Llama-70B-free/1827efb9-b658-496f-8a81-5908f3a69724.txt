Alright, so I've got this question about embryonic cleavage, and I'm trying to figure out which statement is not true. Hmm. Let's break this down.

Okay, first, I remember that cleavage refers to the early divisions of the fertilized egg. It's a series of mitotic divisions without much growth, so the cells get smaller each time. The main purpose is to increase the number of cells, right? 

Looking at the options:

Option A: The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage. I think this is true. Yolk is usually found in the vegetal pole, and I remember that in some animals, like birds, the yolk is abundant. The yolk makes the cells larger, so cleavage is inhibited in areas with a lot of yolk. So A is a true statement.

Option B: Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage. Telolecithal means a lot of yolk concentrated in one part, like the vegetal pole. Meroblastic cleavage is when cleavage is only partial, so in birds and reptiles, the cleavage doesn't split the yolk-rich part entirely. So B sounds correct. Telolecithal eggs do undergo meroblastic cleavage. So B is true.

Option C: The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than the animal pole. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy here. The animal pole typically has less yolk, so maybe it undergoes more cleavage. Because the yolk inhibits cleavage, as in option A. So if the animal pole has less yolk, cleavage happens more there. So C says the opposite. The vegetal pole (more yolk) undergoes cleavage more readily? That doesn't seem right. Because yolk inhibits cleavage, the animal pole without yolk would cleave more. So C is probably false, making it the correct answer to the question.

Option D: The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres. Yes, cleavage is when the zygote divides into blastomeres. So D is a true statement.

So the question is asking which is NOT true. So the false statement is C.

The question asks which statement about embryonic cleavage is NOT true. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage. This is true because yolk-rich regions, like the vegetal pole, have less cleavage due to the inhibition caused by yolk.

- **Option B**: Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage. This is correct because telolecithal eggs, which have concentrated yolk, undergo meroblastic cleavage, where cleavage is partial and does not fully divide the yolk-rich areas.

- **Option C**: The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than the animal pole. This is false because the vegetal pole, being yolk-rich, experiences less cleavage. The animal pole, with less yolk, undergoes more cleavage.

- **Option D**: The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres. This is true, as cleavage involves mitotic divisions that produce blastomeres.

The statement that is NOT true is **Option C**, as the vegetal pole does not undergo cleavage more readily than the animal pole.
