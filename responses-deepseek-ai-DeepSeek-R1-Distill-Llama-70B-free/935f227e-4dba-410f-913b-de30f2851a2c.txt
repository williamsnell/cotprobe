Okay, so I've got this problem here about seating arrangements, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. It says, "In how many ways can 10 people be seated at 1 identical round tables? Each table must have at least 1 person seated." Hmm, wait a minute, so there's only one table, and all 10 people have to sit around it.

Wait, but the question says "identical round tables", but the count is 1. So, I guess it's just a single round table. And each table must have at least one person, but since there's only one table, that means all 10 are seated there. So it's a circular permutation problem.

I remember that for circular permutations, the formula is different from linear arrangements. For arranging n people in a circle, the number of ways is (n-1)! instead of n! because rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical. So for 10 people, it would be 9! ways.

Let me calculate 9! So 9 factorial is 9 ×8 ×7 ×6 ×5 ×4 ×3 ×2 ×1. Let me compute that. 9×8 is 72, times 7 is 504, times 6 is 3024, times 5 is 15120, times 4 is 60480, times 3 is 181440, times 2 is 362880. So 9! equals 362,880.

Looking at the options, option C is 362880, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait another second. The question says "identical round tables". So does that affect anything? Oh, wait, but when there's only one table, the fact that tables are identical doesn't really change the count because there's nothing to compare with. So yeah, it's still (n-1)!.

So I think I'm confident that the answer is C.

The problem involves determining the number of ways to seat 10 people at 1 identical round table, with each table requiring at least one person. Since there is only one table, all 10 people must be seated around it. This is a circular permutation problem.

For circular permutations, the formula is \((n-1)!\), where \(n\) is the number of people, because rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical. For \(n = 10\), the number of ways is:

\[
(10-1)! = 9! = 362,880
\]

Among the given options, the value \(362,880\) corresponds to option C. The fact that the table is "identical" does not affect the calculation, as there is only one table in this scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: 362880

Answer: C
