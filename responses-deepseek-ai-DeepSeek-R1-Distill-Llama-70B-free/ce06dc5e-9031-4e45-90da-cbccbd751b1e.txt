Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the problem says that air is expanded in a cylinder from an initial state of 100 psia and 800°R to a final pressure of 10 psia along a polytropic path with n = 1.3. The process is adiabatic, and air behaves as an ideal gas. I need to calculate the friction of the process per pound mass of air. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused about what exactly is being asked here. The term "friction of the process" isn't something I remember exactly. Oh wait, maybe they're referring to the work done by friction? Or perhaps the heat transfer, but no, the process is adiabatic, so Q is zero. Wait, no, in an adiabatic process, there's no heat exchange, so Q=0. So if it's an adiabatic process, the first law (energy conservation) says that the work done is equal to the change in internal energy.

Wait, but in polytropic processes, the work done is calculated using the formula for polytropic work. Also, for an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. So maybe the question is asking for the work done per unit mass, which would be the specific work.

Wait, I'm getting a bit muddled here. Let me think again. The process is adiabatic, so Q=0. So the work done by the system would be the change in internal energy. But wait, in expansion, the system does work on the surroundings, so the internal energy decreases. So the specific work done (per unit mass) would be the change in internal energy, which is Cp*(T2 - T1), but wait, wait, because for expansion, the system loses internal energy, so the work done by the system would be positive, but the internal energy change is negative.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me make this clearer. The first law for a system undergoing a process is:

ΔU = Q - W

But since the process is adiabatic, Q=0, so ΔU = -W. So the work done by the system is equal to the decrease in internal energy.

But wait, the problem is about friction. Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps "friction" here refers to the irreversibility or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a translation error, and they're referring to the work done, or perhaps the specific work.

Wait, I think I need to focus on the given data and what's being asked. Let's list what's given:

- Initial pressure, P1 = 100 psia
- Initial temperature, T1 = 800°R
- Final pressure, P2 = 10 psia
- Polytropic index, n = 1.3
- Process is adiabatic
- Air is an ideal gas

We need to find the friction per lbm of air. Hmm. Wait, I'm still not clear on what "friction of the process" means here. Maybe it's a term used in the context of internal irreversibilities, such as in an actual (irreversible) adiabatic process where friction would cause entropy increase, but in that case, the work done would be less than that of a reversible process.

Wait, but the process is given as polytropic. Polytropic processes can be either reversible or irreversible, depending on the value of 'n'. For an ideal gas, the reversible adiabatic process (isentropic) has n = γ, where γ is the heat capacity ratio (Cp/Cv). For air, γ is approximately 1.4. So if n is 1.3, which is less than γ, that suggests that the process is not isentropic, perhaps an expansion with some heat transfer (but wait, the process is adiabatic, so Q=0, which complicates things).

Wait, no, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about the work done in a polytropic process. The formula for work done in a polytropic process (per unit mass) is given by:

w = (P1 v1 - P2 v2) / (n - 1)

But wait, that's when the process is PV^n = constant. Alternatively, the work can be expressed in terms of temperatures. Since air is an ideal gas, I can relate pressure and temperature using the ideal gas law.

But wait, maybe I should first find the final temperature T2. Because in a polytropic process, the relation between T and P is known. The relation is T1 / T2 = (P1 / P2)^((n-1)/n)

Wait, yes, because for a polytropic process, TV^(n-1) = constant, and since PV = RT, we can express V in terms of T and P. Let me derive that quickly.

The ideal gas equation: PV = mRT. So V = mRT/P.

In a polytropic process, PV^n = C. So substituting V from ideal gas equation:

P (mRT/P)^n = C → P (m^n R^n T^n) / P^n = C → m^n R^n T^n / P^{n-1} = C → T^n / P^{n-1} = C/m^{n} R^{n}

Wait, maybe another approach. For a polytropic process, the relation between T and P is:

(T2 / T1) = (P2 / P1) ^ [(n-1)/n]

Yes, that's correct. So I can compute T2 using this.

Given P1 = 100 psia, P2 = 10 psia, n=1.3.

So (T2/T1) = (10/100) ^ [(1.3-1)/1.3] = (0.1)^(0.3/1.3)

Let me compute 0.3/1.3 ≈ 0.23077. So 0.1 raised to the 0.23077 power.

Hmm, 0.1^0.23077. Let me calculate that. Let's take natural logs:

ln(0.1^0.23077) = 0.23077 * ln(0.1) ≈ 0.23077 * (-2.302585) ≈ -0.531.

Exponentiating: e^(-0.531) ≈ 0.588.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 0.588. Since T1 is 800°R, T2 ≈ 800 * 0.588 ≈ 470.4 °R.

Wait, but wait, when you expand a gas, the temperature should drop, which is what's happening here, from 800 to ~470 R.

Now, the specific work done in the process is the change in internal energy, because it's an adiabatic process (Q=0). For an ideal gas, ΔU = m * Cv * (T2 - T1).

Wait, but wait a second. The first law says ΔU = Q + W (where W is work done on the system). But in some conventions, W is the work done by the system, so ΔU = Q - W. Since Q=0, ΔU = -W. So the work done by the system is W = -(T2 - T1)*m*Cv. But I'm a bit confused about the sign here.

Wait, in the first law, ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. So if the system does work on the surroundings, W is positive, and ΔU decreases. So yes, in this case, since the process is expansion, work is done by the system, so W is positive, and ΔU = -W.

So, the specific work (per unit mass) would be w = (Cv)(T1 - T2). Because ΔU per unit mass is Cv*(T2 - T1), and W is equal to -(T2 - T1)*Cv.

Wait, but wait, let me get the signs straight. If T2 < T1, then T2 - T1 is negative, so ΔU is negative, which means that the system has lost internal energy, which is converted into work done by the system. So W = -(ΔU) = Cv*(T1 - T2).

Okay, so I need to compute Cv for air. I remember that for air, the specific heat at constant pressure, Cp, is about 0.24 BTU/lbm.R, and the specific heat at constant volume, Cv, is about 0.17 BTU/lbm.R. Wait, are those the right values? Let me double-check. Oh yes, for air, Cp is approximately 0.24 BTU/lbm-°R, and Cv is approximately 0.17 BTU/lbm-°R, since γ = Cp/Cv ≈ 1.4.

So, the specific work w would be:

w = Cv * (T1 - T2) = 0.17 BTU/lbm-°R * (800 - 470.4) °R

Compute 800 - 470.4 = 329.6 °R.

So, 0.17 * 329.6 ≈ let's calculate:

0.17 * 300 = 51, 0.17 * 29.6 ≈ 5.032. So total ≈51 +5.032≈56.032 BTU/lbm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 56.6, which is close. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in T2.

Wait, let me recompute T2 more accurately. Because earlier I approximated 0.1^0.23077 as 0.588, but perhaps a more precise calculation is needed.

Let me compute (P2/P1) = 10/100 = 0.1. The exponent is (n-1)/n = (0.3)/1.3 ≈ 0.23076923.

So, T2 = T1 * (0.1)^(0.23076923)

Let me compute this using logarithms more accurately.

Compute ln(0.1) = -2.302585093.

Multiply by 0.23076923: -2.302585093 * 0.23076923 ≈ -0.531.

So, ln(T2/T1) = -0.531 → T2/T1 = e^(-0.531) ≈ 0.5885.

So T2 = 800 * 0.5885 ≈ 470.8 °R.

So, T1 - T2 = 800 - 470.8 = 329.2 °R.

Now, 0.17 * 329.2 = ?

0.17 * 300 = 51.

0.17 * 29.2 = Let's compute 0.17*29=4.93, 0.17*0.2=0.034 → total 4.964.

So total w ≈51 +4.964=55.964≈56.0 BTU/lbm.

But the option I is 56.6, which is slightly higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the exact value using more precise exponentiation.

Alternatively, perhaps the polytropic process formula for work should be used instead. Because the process is polytropic, maybe I should compute the work using the polytropic work formula, which might be more accurate.

The formula for specific work in a polytropic process is:

w = (R/(1 - n)) * (T1 - T2) / (J) )

Wait, no, perhaps the general work formula for a polytropic process (reversible or not) is:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2) / (n - 1)

But since we're dealing with per unit mass, specific work would be:

w = (P1 v1 - P2 v2) / (n - 1)

Where v is the specific volume, which is volume per unit mass.

But I can express specific volume in terms of ideal gas law: v = R T / P, where R is the specific gas constant for air.

Wait, R for air is 1716 ft·lbf/lbm·R, but when using BTU units, perhaps it's better to convert R to BTU units.

Wait, 1 BTU = 778 ft·lbf, so R = 1716 ft·lbf/lbm·R → in terms of BTU, it's 1716 / 778 ≈ 2.2068 BTU/lbm·R.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me check:

Wait, 1 BTU is approximately 778 foot-pounds-force (ft·lbf). So to convert R from ft·lbf/(lbm·R) to BTU/(lbm·R), divide by 778.

So R = 1716 ft·lbf/(lbm·R) → 1716 / 778 ≈ 2.2068 BTU/(lbm·R).

Wait, but wait, that seems high because I thought R for air is about 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·R), but no, wait, maybe I'm confusing with other units. Let me double-check.

Wait, the universal gas constant R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·R). For air, the specific gas constant is R_specific = R / M, where M is molar mass.

M for air is approximately 28.97 lbm/lbmol. So R_specific = 10.7316 * 144 in²/ft² * ft³/(lbmol·R) / 28.97 lbm/lbmol → wait, let me compute this carefully.

Wait, 1 psia = 144 psfi (pound-force per square inch), but when computing in ft³, perhaps it's more straightforward to compute R in units of ft·lbf/(lbm·R).

Alternatively, I can use the value of R for air as 1716 ft·lbf/(lbm·R), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, another approach: since the process is polytropic and we know T1 and T2, and since for an ideal gas, the internal energy change is only a function of temperature, perhaps the work done is indeed the change in internal energy, which is Cv*(T1 - T2).

But earlier, using Cv=0.17, I got around 56 BTU/lbm, which is close to option I (56.6). But perhaps I made a mistake in the value of Cv.

Wait, maybe I should check the specific heats more accurately. Let me recall that for air, Cp is about 0.24 BTU/lbm·R, and Cv is Cp / γ, where γ is about 1.4. So Cv = 0.24 / 1.4 ≈ 0.1714 BTU/lbm·R. So that's correct.

Wait, so let me recalculate the specific work:

w = Cv*(T1 - T2) = 0.1714 * (800 - 470.8) = 0.1714 * 329.2.

Calculating:

0.1714 * 329.2 → let's compute this step by step.

0.1714 * 300 = 51.42

0.1714 * 29.2 → compute 0.1714 * 30 = 5.142, but since it's 29.2, which is 0.8 less than 30.

So, 0.1714 * 29.2 = 5.142 - (0.1714 * 0.8) → 5.142 - 0.13712 ≈5.00488.

So total w ≈51.42 +5.00488=56.42488 ≈56.42 BTU/lbm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I:56.6, but it's a bit higher than my calculation. Hmm, maybe I made an error in calculating T2.

Let me compute T2 more accurately. I had T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^( (n-1)/n )

So (n-1)/n = 0.3/1.3 ≈0.23076923.

So, (P2/P1)=0.1. So 0.1^0.23076923.

Let me compute this using more precise logarithms:

ln(0.1)= -2.302585093.

Multiply by 0.23076923: -2.302585093 * 0.23076923 ≈-0.531.

So, e^(-0.531) → let's compute this accurately.

e^(-0.531) = 1 / e^(0.531).

Compute e^0.531: e^0.5 is about 1.64872, e^0.531 is a bit higher.

Using calculator: e^0.531 ≈1.700.

So 1/1.700≈0.5882.

So T2 ≈800 * 0.5882≈470.56 °R.

So T1 - T2=800 -470.56=329.44 °R.

Now, w=0.1714 *329.44 ≈let's compute:

0.1714 *329.44 → break it down:

0.1714 * 300 =51.42

0.1714 *29.44 → compute 0.1714*29=4.9706, and 0.1714*0.44≈0.0754.

So 4.9706 +0.0754≈5.046.

Total w≈51.42 +5.046≈56.466 BTU/lbm.

So approximately 56.47, which is very close to option I:56.6. Hmm, but option I is 56.6, which is a bit higher. Perhaps I missed a decimal somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the specific heats. Maybe I was too quick to approximate Cv as 0.1714. Let me check the exact value.

Cp for air is 0.24 BTU/lbm·R, and γ (Cp/Cv) is 1.4, so Cv=0.24/1.4=0.17142857 BTU/lbm·R.

So that's precise. So using that, with T1-T2=329.44, the work would be:

0.17142857 *329.44= ?

Let me compute this more accurately.

329.
