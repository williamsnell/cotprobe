Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the volume of a solid formed by rotating the region bounded by the x-axis and the function f(x) = x/(1 + x³) about the x-axis. Hmm, I remember that when you rotate a function around the x-axis, the volume can be found using the method of disks or washers. 

Wait, right, the formula for the volume when rotating around the x-axis is π times the integral from a to b of [f(x)]² dx. So I need to set up that integral. But first, I should figure out the limits of integration, a and b. 

The region is bounded by the x-axis, so I guess I'm looking for where the function f(x) intersects the x-axis. The x-axis is y=0, so setting f(x) to zero: x/(1 + x³) = 0. The numerator must be zero, so x = 0. Hmm, but wait, that's just one point. Oh, I think I also need to consider where the function starts and ends. Or perhaps it's an infinite region? Because as x approaches infinity, what does f(x) do? Let me see, x/(1 + x³) simplifies to approximately 1/x² for large x, so it approaches zero. So maybe the region is from x=0 to x approaching infinity? 

Wait, but the function might have asymptotes or other points where it crosses the x-axis. Let me think again. At x=0, the function is zero. What about negative x? If x is negative, the denominator is 1 + (-x)^3 = 1 - x³. So for x negative, say x approaches -1, the denominator approaches zero, so the function goes to negative infinity. But wait, the problem says the region bounded by the x-axis and the function. So perhaps we're only considering the area where y is positive since it's bounded by the x-axis. So maybe we're looking at x from 0 to some point where the function is positive again, but wait, for x>0, the function x/(1+x³) is positive because numerator and denominator are both positive. So from x=0 to x approaching infinity, it's positive, and approaches zero as x goes to infinity. 

But wait, is the function defined for all x? Let me check the denominator 1 + x³. It's zero when x³ = -1, so x = -1. So the function has a vertical asymptote at x = -1. But since the region bounded by the x-axis, maybe the region is from x=-infinity to x=-1? No, because at x approaching -1 from the left, the denominator approaches zero from the negative side, and the numerator would be negative (since x is negative), so the function approaches positive infinity? Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. But the problem specifies the region bounded by the x-axis and the function. So perhaps we're considering the area where the function is above the x-axis (positive y) and bounded by it. 

Wait, but for x > 0, the function is positive, and for x < -1, what's happening? Let me pick x = -2: denominator is 1 + (-8) = -7, numerator is -2, so the function is (-2)/(-7) = 2/7, positive. So between x = -1 and x = 0, what's the function doing? Let's pick x = -0.5: denominator is 1 + (-0.125) = 0.875, positive. Numerator is -0.5, so f(x) is negative. So the function is negative between x = -1 and x = 0. So the area bounded by the x-axis would be where the function is above or below? Hmm, but the x-axis is y=0, so the region bounded by it would be where the function is above the x-axis (positive y) and between certain x-values. 

Wait, perhaps the region is from x=0 to x approaching infinity, because that's where the function is positive. So the limits of integration would be from 0 to infinity. But wait, the problem says "the region bounded by the x-axis and the function." That could imply that the function crosses the x-axis somewhere else. Wait, earlier I thought f(x) is zero only at x=0. Let me double-check: f(x) = x/(1 + x³). So f(x) = 0 when x=0. So the area is from x=0 to x= some point where maybe the function returns to zero. But as x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches zero again. So the region is from x=0 to x=∞, bounded above by f(x) and below by the x-axis. 

So the volume is π times the integral from 0 to ∞ of [x/(1 + x³)]² dx. Hmm, integrating from 0 to infinity. That seems a bit tricky, but maybe there's a substitution that can make this easier. 

Let me write the integral as π ∫₀^∞ [x² / (1 + x³)²] dx. Hmm, perhaps substitution. Let me set u = 1 + x³. Then du/dx = 3x², so (du) = 3x² dx → x² dx = du/3. 

But wait, when x=0, u=1, and as x→∞, u→∞. So substituting, the integral becomes π ∫_{u=1}^{u=∞} [x²/(u)^2] * (du/(3x²))). Wait, but x² cancels out, so I have π ∫₁^∞ (1/u²) * (du/3). So that's π/3 ∫₁^∞ u^(-2) du. 

The integral of u^(-2) is -u^(-1). So evaluating from 1 to ∞: 

At ∞, -u^(-1) is 0. At 1, it's -1. So subtracting, [0 - (-1)] = 1. So the integral is π/3 * 1 = π/3. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. So substitution steps:

- Let u = 1 + x³ → du = 3x² dx → x² dx = du/3.

The integral becomes ∫ (x² dx) / (1 + x³)^2 = ∫ (du/3) / u² = (1/3) ∫ u^(-2) du.

Which integrates to (1/3)(-u^(-1)) + C → -1/(3u) + C.

Evaluated from u=1 to u=∞: 

At u=∞: -1/(3*∞) → 0.

At u=1: -1/(3*1) = -1/3.

So subtracting, [0 - (-1/3)] = 1/3.

Multiply by π: (1/3) * π = π/3.

So the volume is π/3. Looking at the options, option E is π/3. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait another moment—am I missing something? Because sometimes when functions have asymptotes or the region extends to infinity, you have to ensure that the integral converges. But in this case, the integral from 0 to ∞ of x²/(1+x³)^2 dx converges because as x approaches infinity, the integrand behaves like x²/x^6 = 1/x^4, which is integrable.

So yeah, I think I did it right. So the volume is π/3, which is option E.

To find the volume of the solid generated by rotating the region bounded by the x-axis and the function \( f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + x^3} \) about the x-axis, we use the method of disks. The formula for the volume is:

\[
V = \pi \int_{a}^{b} [f(x)]^2 \, dx
\]

### Step 1: Determine the limits of integration
The region is bounded by the x-axis (\( y = 0 \)) and the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + x^3} \) is positive for \( x > 0 \) and approaches zero as \( x \to \infty \). Therefore, the region of interest is from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = \infty \).

### Step 2: Set up the integral
Substituting \( f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + x^3} \) into the volume formula, we get:

\[
V = \pi \int_{0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{x}{1 + x^3} \right)^2 \, dx = \pi \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{x^2}{(1 + x^3)^2} \, dx
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the integral using substitution
Let \( u = 1 + x^3 \). Then, \( du = 3x^2 \, dx \), which implies \( x^2 \, dx = \frac{du}{3} \). Substituting these into the integral:

\[
V = \pi \int_{u=1}^{u=\infty} \frac{1}{u^2} \cdot \frac{du}{3} = \frac{\pi}{3} \int_{1}^{\infty} u^{-2} \, du
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the integral
The integral of \( u^{-2} \) is \( -u^{-1} \). Evaluating this from \( u = 1 \) to \( u = \infty \):

\[
\int_{1}^{\infty} u^{-2} \, du = \left[ -\frac{1}{u} \right]_{1}^{\infty} = \left( 0 - \left( -\frac{1}{1} \right) \right) = 1
\]

Thus, the volume is:

\[
V = \frac{\pi}{3} \cdot 1 = \frac{\pi}{3}
\]

### Step 5: Match the result to the options
From the given options, \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) corresponds to option **E**.
