Okay, so I have this question here about data transmission, and I need to figure it out. Let's see... The question is asking about when data must arrive exactly as they were sent. Hmm, I remember from my networking classes that there are different terms related to data security and integrity.

Wait, the key here is that the data arrives exactly as sent. So it's about ensuring that the data hasn't been altered or corrupted during transmission. I think that's related to integrity. Let me think about each option.

Option A is Message Security. I'm not too sure about that one. Security can be a broad term, including confidentiality and integrity, but the question specifically mentions the data arriving exactly, so maybe it's more specific than that.

Option B: Message Clarity. That doesn't ring a bell. Clarity might refer to how clear the message is, but not necessarily if it's unchanged.

Option C: Message Integrity. Oh right, integrity is about the accuracy and completeness of the data. So yes, if data arrives exactly as sent, that's integrity.

Option D: Message Authenticity. Authenticity is about making sure the message is from the correct sender, not about the content being unchanged. So that's different.

Option E: Message Splashing. I don't recall ever hearing that term. Maybe it's a distractor.

Option F: Message Reliability. Reliability in networking usually refers to whether the data arrives at all, like using protocols that ensure delivery, but not necessarily about the data being unchanged.

Option G: Message Sending. That's just the act of sending, not about the state upon arrival.

Option H: Message Stability. Not sure about that. Stability might refer to consistent performance over time, not data integrity.

Option I: Message Confidentiality. That's about keeping the data secret, so unauthorized parties can't read it. But again, the question is about the data arriving unchanged, not about secrecy.

Option J: Message Completion. That sounds like whether the entire message arrives, but again, not necessarily about being unaltered.

So putting it all together, the term that refers to data arriving exactly as sent is Message Integrity. So the answer should be option C.
