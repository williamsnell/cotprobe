Okay, so I have this question about learned helplessness and which psychological concept it's an example of. Hmm. I remember that learned helplessness is a term from psychology, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think through this.

I think learned helplessness was first studied in animals. The classic experiment was with dogs, right? They were given electric shocks, and some could stop the shocks by pressing a lever, while others couldn't. Then later, when the dogs who couldn't stop the shocks before were put in a situation where they could escape, they didn't even try. They just lay down and took the shocks because they had learned that they were helpless.

So, the key here is that the behavior is being modified based on consequences, like rewards or punishments. Wait, but in this case, it's more about the absence of control over the outcome. The dogs learned that their actions didn't matter, so they became passive.

I remember that operant conditioning is about how behavior is controlled by its consequences. So positive reinforcement is when you add a pleasing stimulus, like a reward, to increase a behavior. Negative reinforcement is when you remove an aversive stimulus, which also increases behavior. But learned helplessness seems different. It's more about learning that your actions don't affect the outcome, leading to a decrease in trying.

Wait, so in operant conditioning, when a behavior isn't reinforced, it can extinguish. But learned helplessness is a specific type of extinction where the individual learns that their responses don't influence the environment. So it's a form of operant conditioning because it's about the relationship between behavior and its consequences (or lack thereof).

Other options: classical conditioning is about associative learning, like Pavlov's dogs salivating when they hear a bell. That doesn't fit here. Intrinsic motivation is when you do something because it's rewarding in itself, not because of external factors. Observational learning is about learning by watching others, like in Bandura's experiments. Modeling is a part of social learning, where behavior is imitated. Cognitive dissonance is about holding conflicting thoughts and trying to reduce discomfort. Negative reinforcement is part of operant conditioning but is when an unpleasant stimulus is removed, which increases the behavior.

So learned helplessness is best explained by operant conditioning because it's about how behavior is learned based on the consequences (or lack) of previous actions. Therefore, the answer should be H: operant conditioning.

Learned helplessness is a concept that arises from operant conditioning, as it involves the modification of behavior based on the consequences of actions. In the classic experiments, animals learned that their actions had no effect on outcomes, leading to passivity. This aligns with operant conditioning, where behavior is shaped by reinforcement or the absence of it. Other options like classical conditioning, intrinsic motivation, or observational learning do not fit as well.
