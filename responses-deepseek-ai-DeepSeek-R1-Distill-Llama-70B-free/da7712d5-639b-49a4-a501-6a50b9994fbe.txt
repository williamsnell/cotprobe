I: denies the antecedent or affirms the consequent
J: classifies subjects

Okay, so I have this logic question here about disjunctive syllogisms. Hmm, I remember that syllogisms are a form of deductive reasoning, right? There's different types like categorical and disjunctive. 

Wait, disjunctive syllogism specifically deals with "or" statements. I think the basic structure is something like if A then B, but A is not the case, so B must be. Or something along those lines. Oh right, the two types of syllogisms are modus ponens and modus tollens. But wait, no, those are for conditional syllogisms. Disjunctive must be different.

So, a disjunctive syllogism has a major premise that presents two or more alternatives. Like, "Either P or Q." Then, one of the propositions is denied, leading to the conclusion that the other must be true. For example, if it's either raining or snowing, and it's not raining, then it must be snowing.

The question is asking about the major premise of a valid disjunctive syllogism. So, the major premise is the one that sets up the alternatives. Looking at the options, option F says "includes two or more alternatives." That makes sense because a disjunctive premise presents multiple options connected by 'or.'

Wait, what about the other options? Option A talks about affirming the antecedent or denying the consequent. That sounds more like conditional syllogism rules, like modus ponens and tollens. So A is probably not the right choice here.

Option D says three or more alternatives. I think disjunctive can have more than two, but traditionally, it's two. So the premise includes two, so F is better than D.

Option I is about denying the antecedent or affirming the consequent. That relates to conditional statements again, and I think those are invalid forms, like denying the antecedent fallacy.

So putting it together, the major premise of a disjunctive syllogism includes two or more alternatives, which is option F.

A disjunctive syllogism involves reasoning with "or" statements, where the major premise presents two or more alternatives (e.g., "Either P or Q"). From this, if one alternative is denied, the other must be affirmed. The question asks about the major premise of a valid disjunctive syllogism, which must include two or more alternatives. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** refers to conditional syllogisms (modus ponens and tollens), not disjunctive ones.
- **Option D** suggests three or more alternatives, but disjunctive syllogisms traditionally involve two.
- **Option F** correctly states that the major premise includes two or more alternatives, aligning with the structure of disjunctive syllogisms.
- Other options, such as **I**, relate to conditional statements and are irrelevant here.

Thus, the correct answer is **F**.

Answer: F
