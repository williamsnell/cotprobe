Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about passive personality jurisdiction, and I need to figure out the correct answer. I'm a bit rusty on my international law terms, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that jurisdiction refers to the authority a court has to hear a case. There are different types of jurisdiction, like territorial, active personality, passive personality, and universal. Each has different criteria for when a country can claim jurisdiction over a case.

I think active personality jurisdiction is when a country claims jurisdiction because the offender is a national of that country. So, if a French citizen commits a crime anywhere, France might prosecute under active personality.

Passive personality must be the opposite in some way. Instead of focusing on the offender's nationality, maybe it's about the victim's nationality. So, if a country's citizen is the victim, the country might claim jurisdiction over the offender, regardless of where the crime was committed.

Looking at the options, option D says it's based on the nationality of the victims. That sounds right because passive personality is about the victim's nationality. So the country of the victim can prosecute the offender, even if the crime happened elsewhere.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing this with other types. Territorial jurisdiction is where the crime occurred, which is option I, but that's not passive personality. Universal jurisdiction is for crimes like genocide, which any country can prosecute, but that's option G, which mentions international law.

So the key here is that passive personality jurisdiction is when the victim's nationality gives the country jurisdiction. That would be option D.

Passive personality jurisdiction allows a country to assert jurisdiction over a case based on the nationality of the victim. This means that if a citizen of a particular country is the victim of a crime, that country can claim the authority to prosecute the offender, regardless of where the crime was committed. 

The correct answer is D: It is jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victims.

Answer: D
