Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about blood types. Hmm. Let me try to think through it step by step. So the question is: Two individuals, one with type B blood and one with type AB blood, have a child. What's the probability that the child has type O blood?

Wait, I remember that blood types are determined by the ABO system, which involves three alleles: IA, IB, and i. IA and IB are dominant over i, and they're codominant with each other. So type A has IAIA or IAi, type B is IBIB or IBi, AB is IAIB, and O is ii.

Let me break down the parents' genotypes. The first parent is type B. So their genotype could be either IBIB or IBi. The second parent is type AB, which means their genotype must be IAIB because that's the only genotype for AB blood.

Wait, no, wait. Type AB has both IA and IB alleles, so their genotype is IAIB. And the type B parent, since they can either be IBIB or IBi. Oh wait, but type B can only be IBIB or IBi. So when they have a child, the possible alleles each can contribute would depend on their genotype.

Wait, but the question is about the child having type O, which is ii. So the child must get an i allele from each parent.

Let me think: for the child to have type O blood, both parents must contribute an i allele. So I need to figure out the probability that each parent gives an i.

Looking at the parents: one parent is type B, which is IBIB or IBi. The other is AB, IAIB.

Wait, the AB parent: IAIB. So what alleles can they pass on? IA or IB, right? Because each parent gives one allele. So for IAIB, they can give either IA or IB, each with 50% chance.

Wait no, wait. Wait, when someone is IAIB, their gametes are IA or IB. So each gamete has either IA or IB, each 50% chance.

But for the B parent's genotype, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The B parent can be either IBIB (homozygous) or IBi (heterozygous). Because type B is IBIB or IBi. So the B parent's genotype is either IBIB or IBi.

Wait, but without knowing which, perhaps we have to consider both possibilities. Or wait, wait, no, maybe I can just figure it out. Let's think: the B parent must pass either IB or i. Because if they're IBIB, then all their gametes are IB. But if they're IBi, then 50% IB and 50% i.

So the AB parent can only contribute IA or IB. So the possible combinations would be IA from AB and... from B parent either IB or i, depending on their genotype.

Wait, but the child's blood type is determined by the combination. So to get O, the child must get i from each parent.

So let me think: the AB parent can only give IA or IB. So if the AB parent gives IA or IB, and the B parent gives IB or i.

Wait, but for the child to have ii (type O), each parent must give an i. So the AB parent must give an i? Wait, but AB parents can't give i, right? Because their genotype is IAIB, so they can only give IA or IB. So they don't have an i allele to give.

Oh wait, that's a key point. So the AB parent can't contribute an i allele because they don't have one. So if the AB parent is IAIB, their gametes are IA or IB. So the child can't get an i from the AB parent. So the child's alleles would be IA from AB and whatever from the B parent, or IB from AB and whatever from the B parent.

Wait, but since the AB parent can't give i, the child can't get ii, because one allele must come from the AB parent, which is either IA or IB.

So that would mean that the child cannot have type O blood, because they would have at least one allele that's not i. So the probability is zero.

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me try to outline the possible crosses.

Parent 1: Type B. Genotype could be IBIB or IBi.

Parent 2: Type AB. Genotype IAIB.

Case 1: Parent 1 is IBIB.

So, gametes from Parent 1 (IBIB) can only be IB.

Parent 2 (IAIB) can produce IA or IB.

So possible offspring:

IA (from parent 2) + IB (from parent 1) = IAIB → type AB.

IB (from parent 2) + IB (from parent 1) = IBIB → type B.

So in this case, the possible blood types are AB and B. No chance of O.

Case 2: Parent 1 is IBi.

So, gametes from Parent 1 are IB (50%) or i (50%).

Parent 2 is IAIB, so gametes IA (50%) or IB (50%).

So the possible combinations:

IA (from P2) + IB (P1) → IAIB → AB.

IA (P2) + i (P1) → IAi → type A.

IB (P2) + IB (P1) → IBIB → type B.

IB (P2) + i (P1) → IBi → type B.

So possible blood types are AB, A, B, B.

So in this case, possible blood types are AB, A, and B. No O.

Wait a minute, so in both cases, whether the B parent is IBIB or IBi, the child can't get O blood. Because the AB parent always gives either IA or IB, and the B parent can give IB or i.

Wait, but if the B parent is IBi, then they can give i. But the AB parent can't, so the child would get IA or IB from AB, and IB or i from B.

So if the B parent contributes i, then the child's genotype would be IAi (from IA and i) or IBi (from IB and i).

IAi is type A, IBi is type B.

So in no case does the child get ii (type O).

So the probability is zero.

So looking at the options, option C is 0%.
</think>

To determine the probability that a child has type O blood when one parent has type B blood and the other has type AB blood, we analyze the genotypes and possible allele combinations.

Blood types are determined by the ABO system, where the alleles are **IA**, **IB**, and **i**. The genotype-to-phenotype relationships are as follows:
- Type A: **IAIA** or **IAi**
- Type B: **IBIB** or **IBi**
- Type AB: **IAIB**
- Type O: **ii**

### Parent Genotypes:
1. **Type B parent**: The genotype could be **IBIB** (homozygous) or **IBi** (heterozygous).
2. **Type AB parent**: The genotype is **IAIB** (heterozygous, as AB blood requires one **IA** and one **IB** allele).

### Gamete Contributions:
- The **Type AB parent** (**IAIB**) can only produce gametes with **IA** or **IB** (50% chance for each).
- The **Type B parent**:
  - If **IBIB** (homozygous), all gametes will carry **IB**.
  - If **IBi** (heterozygous), gametes will carry **IB** (50%) or **i** (50%).

### Child's Blood Type:
For the child to have type O blood (**ii**), they must inherit an **i** allele from **both** parents. However:
- The **Type AB parent** (**IAIB**) cannot contribute an **i** allele, as they only have **IA** and **IB** alleles.
- Therefore, the child will always inherit at least one **IA** or **IB** allele from the **Type AB parent**, making it impossible for the child to have type O blood (**ii**).

### Conclusion:
Since the **Type AB parent** cannot pass on an **i** allele, the child cannot have type O blood. The probability of the child having type O blood is **0%**.
