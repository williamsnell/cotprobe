Okay, so I have this problem here about a sling psychrometer, and I need to calculate specific humidity, relative humidity, and dew point temperature. The given dry bulb temperature (DBT) is 85°F and the wet bulb temperature (WBT) is 65°F. The atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on psychrometry, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that a psychrometer measures the WBT and DBT to determine the properties of the air. The specific humidity, which is the mass of water vapor per mass of dry air, is what I need for part (a). Relative humidity is part (b), and dew point is part (c).

I think the first step is to use the psychrometric chart or the equations related to psychrometry. But since I don't have the chart in front of me, I'll have to rely on formulas.

I recall that the specific humidity (w) can be found using the formula derived from the psychrometer equations. The formula I think is:

w = (P_w / (P_atm - P_w)) * (M_w / M_a)

Where P_w is the partial pressure of water vapor, P_atm is atmospheric pressure, M_w is molar mass of water, and M_a is molar mass of air. Oh wait, but to get P_w, I need the saturation pressure at the wet bulb temperature.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The correct approach is to use the wet bulb temperature to find the humidity. I think the formula connects the dry and wet bulb temperatures to determine the humidity.

Another approach is the psychrometer equation, which relates the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures to the humidity. The equation is:

P_w = P_s_at_wbt * ( (T_db - T_wb) / (T_db - T_dp) )^(some exponent)

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I remember that the specific humidity can be calculated using the equation:

w = (0.622 * P_sw) / (P_atm - P_sw)

Where P_sw is the saturation pressure at the wet bulb temperature.

So first, I need to find the saturation pressure at 65°F (the WBT). I'll need to convert that temperature to Rankine or Kelvin, but I think Fahrenheit can be used with the appropriate saturation table.

Wait, I remember that the saturation pressure of water can be found using the Antoine equation or by looking up steam tables. Since I don't have the tables in front of me, I'll have to approximate.

Alternatively, I remember that at 65°F, the saturation pressure is around 0.25 psia or something like that. Wait, no, let me think. At 60°F, I think the saturation pressure is about 0.1497 psia, and at 70°F, it's 0.3632 psia. So 65°F is between 60 and 70. Let me interpolate.

The temperature difference between 60 and 70 is 10°F, and 65 is 5°F above 60. The saturation pressures at 60°F and 70°F are approximately 0.1497 psia and 0.3632 psia, respectively.

So the difference is 0.3632 - 0.1497 = 0.2135 psia over 10°F. So per degree, 0.02135 psia/°F. So for 5°F above 60, it's 0.1497 + 5 * 0.02135 = 0.1497 + 0.10675 = 0.25645 psia. Let's say approximately 0.256 psia.

Wait, but I think I might have that wrong. Let me make sure. Alternatively, I can use the Antoine equation to calculate it more accurately. The Antoine equation is:

log10(P) = A - (B / (T + C))

Where T is in °C. So first, convert 65°F to Celsius. 65 -32 = 33 *5/9 ≈ 0.5556 *33 = 18.333°C.

The Antoine constants for water (IUPAC) are A=8.14019, B=1810.94, C=244.485. So:

log10(P) = 8.14019 - (1810.94 / (18.333 +244.485)) 

Denominator is 18.333 +244.485 = 262.818.

So 1810.94 / 262.818 ≈ 6.893.

So log10(P) = 8.14019 -6.893 = 1.24719.

So P = 10^1.24719 ≈ 17.54 kPa. Wait, wait, because the Antoine equation gives P in kPa? Or in another unit? Hmm, no, I think the units depend on the source. Let me double-check. Oh wait, the Antoine coefficients I used are for P in kPa when T is in °C.

Wait no, I might have made a mistake. Let me think again. I might have the wrong units. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for P in inches of Hg or another unit. Maybe it's better to look for a simpler approximation.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. I remember another formula to find the vapor pressure at WBT.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula for specific humidity based on the psychrometer. The formula I found once is:

w = (0.622 * P_sw) / (P_atm - P_sw)

But P_sw is the saturation pressure at the WBT, which is 65°F. So first, I need to find P_sw.

Alternatively, I can use the psychrometric equation which is:

(T_db - T_wb) / (T_wb - T_dp) = (P_atm / P_sw) * (0.622 * (P_sat_dbt / P_sw)) )

Wait, maybe I should look for the formula that connects DBT, WBT, and RH. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the approximate formula:

RH = (P_sw_wbt / P_sat_dbt) * 100

Wait, but that's only true if the air is saturated at DBT, which it's not. No, wait, that's not the right approach either.

Wait, another approach: The relative humidity can be calculated using the formula:

RH = (P_w) / (P_sat_dbt) * 100

Where P_w is the water vapor pressure in the air, and P_sat_dbt is the saturation pressure at the dry bulb temperature.

But how to find P_w? Well, from the wet bulb temperature. The wet bulb temperature is related to the water vapor pressure.

I think another formula connects the WBT and DBT to find P_w. The formula is:

P_w = P_sat_wbt * exp[ ( (H_wg * M_w) / (R * T_wb) ) * (1 - (T_wb / T_db)) ) ]

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the psychrometer equation is:

(T_db - T_wb) = ( (P_atm * M_a) / (H_fg * M_w) ) * ln( P_sat_wbt / P_w )

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try another approach.

I think the correct psychrometer formula is:

(T_db - T_wb) = ( (P_atm * (M_a / M_w) ) / (H_fg * (1 + (M_w/M_a)*w )) ) * (w * M_w / M_a )

Wait, maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, I can use the formula for specific humidity:

w = (0.622 * P_sw) / (P_atm - P_sw)

But P_sw is the saturation pressure at WBT, which is 65°F. So first, find P_sw.

Let me look up (or approximate) the saturation pressure at 65°F. I think I remember that at 60°F, P_sat is about 0.25 psia, but let's check:

Wait, I found once that at 60°F, P_sat is approximately 0.25 psia; at 70°F, it's about 0.363 psia. So 65°F is halfway, but since it's a logarithmic scale, let's approximate.

Wait no, I think the actual values are:

At 60°F (15.56°C): P_sat ≈ 0.2517 psia.

At 65°F (18.33°C): P_sat ≈ 0.4071 psia.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should use more accurate data. Let me think:

I found a psychrometric chart online once, and at 65°F WBT, the specific humidity is about 0.009 lbm_water/lbm_dry_air. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's try to compute it. Let's find the saturation pressure at 65°F.

Using the Antoine equation again. Let me get the correct Antoine coefficients. Antoine equation for water (IUPAC formulation):

log10(P) = A - (B / (T + C))

Where P is in kPa, and T is in °C.

A = 8.14019, B = 1810.94, C = 244.485.

So T is 65°F = (65 - 32) * 5/9 = 33 *5/9 = 18.333°C.

Compute denominator: 18.333 +244.485 = 262.818

Compute B/(T + C): 1810.94 /262.818 ≈ 6.893

So log10(P) = 8.14019 -6.893 ≈ 1.2472

P = 10^1.2472 ≈ 17.54 kPa.

Convert that to psia. Since 1 kPa = 0.1450377 psia.

17.54 kPa * 0.1450377 ≈ 2.544 psia? That can't be right because at 65°F, P_sat shouldn't be over 2 psia.

Wait, no, wait. Wait 17.54 kPa is about 2.544 psia, but that seems high. Because at 100°F, P_sat is about 14.7 psia (boiling point). So 65°F should be much lower. Wait, no, 65°F is 18.33°C, which I think has a P_sat of around 2.36 kPa, not 17.54. Wait, so I think I messed up the units.

Wait, perhaps the Antoine equation gives P in mmHg instead of kPa. Let me check: I think I might have used the wrong units. Because I've seen Antoine constants where the result is in mmHg.

Wait, another set of Antoine constants for water (I think when using mmHg) are A=8.14019, B=1810.94, C=244.485. So, when T is in °C, P is in mmHg.

Wait, that makes more sense. So let me recalculate.

log10(P_mmHg) = 8.14019 - (1810.94 / (T + 244.485))

So T = 65°F = 18.333°C.

Compute denominator: 18.333 +244.485 = 262.818.

Compute 1810.94 /262.818 ≈ 6.893.

So log10(P_mmHg) = 8.14019 -6.893 ≈ 1.24719.

So P_mmHg = 10^1.24719 ≈ 17.54 mmHg.

Convert that to psia. Since 1 atm is 29.92126 inHg, and 1 psi is 0.0254 inHg? No, wait, 1 psi is 0.0254 meters of water, no. Let's think: 1 atm = 14.7 psia = 29.92 inHg.

So 1 mmHg = 14.7 / 760 ≈ 0.019337 psia.

So 17.54 mmHg * 0.019337 ≈ 0.340 psia.

Ah, okay, that makes sense. So P_sw at 65°F is approximately 0.34 psia.

Now, back to the specific humidity formula:

w = (0.622 * P_sw) / (P_atm - P_sw)

P_atm is given as 14.7 psia.

So P_sw = 0.34 psia.

Plugging in:

w = (0.622 * 0.34) / (14.7 - 0.34) = (0.21148) / (14.36) ≈ 0.01474 lbm_water/lbm_dry_air.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have around 0.0147. The closest is option A: 0.011, H: 0.012, etc. Hmm, maybe my calculation is wrong. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Antoine calculation. Let me recalculate P_sw.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the steam tables. At 65°F, the saturation pressure is approximately 0.4071 psia? Or wait, I'm getting confused between °C and °F. Let me think: 65°F is 18.33°C.

Looking up steam table data at 18.33°C, the saturation pressure should be about 2.11 kPa, which is 0.306 psia (since 1 kPa ≈ 0.145 psia). So 2.11 kPa = 2.11 * 0.145 ≈ 0.306 psia.

Wait, earlier with the Antoine equation, I got 17.54 mmHg, which is 0.34 psia. So perhaps 0.306 psia is more accurate. So let's use 0.306 psia.

Then, w = (0.622 * 0.306) / (14.7 - 0.306) = (0.189172) / (14.394) ≈ 0.01314 lbm/lbm.

Hmm, that's about 0.0131. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should use the psychrometric chart approach. I remember that for a DBT of 85°F and WBT of 65°F, the specific humidity is around 0.009 to 0.01 lbm/lbm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Maybe the correct formula is:

w = (0.622 * P_sw) / (P_atm - P_sw)

But P_sw is the saturation pressure at WBT, which is 65°F, so 0.306 psia.

So w = 0.622 * 0.306 / (14.7 - 0.306) = 0.622 *0.306 ≈ 0.190; denominator is 14.394.

0.190 / 14.394 ≈ 0.0132 lbm/lbm.

Hmm, but the options don't have this value. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: 0.011

B: 0.0095

C: 0.00859

D:0.0075

E:0.01

F:0.005

G:0.007

H:0.012

I:0.009

J:0.006

So the closest to 0.013 is option H:0.012, but that's 0.012, which is 0.0012 higher than my calculated 0.0132. So perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of P_sw. Let me think again.

Wait, I found a source that says at 65°F, the saturation pressure is 0.4071 psia. No, that can't be right because at 70°F it's about 0.363 psia. Wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing up Celsius and Fahrenheit. Let me confirm.

Wait, perhaps 65°F is 18.33°C, and the saturation pressure at 18.33°C is approximately 2.11 kPa, which is about 0.306 psia. So perhaps my initial calculation was correct.

Hmm, but then why don't the options match? Perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Let me think of another method.

Wait, perhaps the specific humidity can be found from the psychrometric chart. Alternatively, I might have the formula wrong. Another formula I found is:

w = ( (P_atm - P_sw) / (P_atm - P_sw) ) * something. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

w = 0.622 * (P_sw) / (P_atm - P_sw)

Which is what I used. So perhaps I made a mistake in the P_sw value.

Wait, another approach: perhaps it's better to use the approximation method. For a sling psychrometer, the specific humidity can be approximated using the formula:

w = (0.00085 * (T_db - T_wb) ) + 0.0000025 * (T_db - T_wb)^2 * something? No, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, I can use the formula that relates the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures to find the relative humidity.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the relative humidity first. The formula is:

RH = (P_w) / (P_sat_dbt) * 100%

Where P_w is the water vapor pressure, and P_sat_dbt is the saturation pressure at DBT.

How to find P_w? From the wet bulb readings. There's a formula for P_w in terms of the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures.

The formula is:

P_w = P_sat_wbt * exp( (M_w * g) / (R * T_wb) * (T_wb - T_db) / (M_a * (T_db + 273.15)) ) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, the psychrometer equation can be written as:

(T_db - T_wb) = ( (M_a * P_atm) / (M_w * H_fg) ) * ( (P_sat_wbt - P_w) / (T_wb + 273.15) )

But I'm getting stuck here because I don't remember all the constants.

Wait, another approach: I can use the approximation that relative humidity is:

RH = (P_sw_wbt / P_sat_dbt) * 100%

Wait, but that's not accurate because P_sw_wbt is the saturation at WBT, but the actual vapor pressure is lower. So that would give RH as (P_sw_wbt / P_sat_dbt) * 100%, but that's only if the air is saturated at WBT, which it's not. So that's
