Question:

A company contracted with a builder to construct a new corporate headquarters for a fixed price of $100 million. At the time of the contract, structural steel was widely available and was included in the contract as a $6 million item. Before work began on the project, tornado damage shut down the production facility of the biggest structural steel supplier in the country, and the price of structural steel increased by 20% as a result. The builder informed the company of the steel price increase, and the parties then orally agreed to increase the project price to $101 million. The builder proceeded with construction and delivered the project on time. The company paid the builder $100 million but refused to pay the additional $1 million. If the builder sues the company for $1 million, is the builder likely to prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the price change of structural steel was not significant enough to warrant a contract modification.
B: No, because there was no consideration for the modification of the contract.
C: No, because the modification was never reduced to a writing signed by the party to be charged.
D: No, because the company did not sign a new contract reflecting the price change.
E: Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel.
F: Yes, because the builder completed the project on time despite the unforeseen circumstances.
G: Yes, because the builder had no control over the price increase of structural steel.
H: Yes, because the companyÕs promise was supported by consideration.
I: Yes, because the company was aware of the price increase and verbally agreed to it.
J: No, because the builder should have anticipated potential price fluctuations in materials.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, specifically dealing with modifications to a contract. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The situation is that a company hired a builder to construct their headquarters for a fixed price of $100 million. Structural steel was a $6 million item in that contract. Then, before any work started, there was a tornado that damaged the main steel supplier, causing steel prices to go up by 20%. The builder told the company about this, and they orally agreed to increase the project price by $1 million, making it $101 million. The builder did the work on time, but the company only paid $100 million. Now, the builder is suing for the extra million. The question is whether the builder will win.

Hmm, so the main issue here is whether the oral modification of the contract is enforceable. I remember that the common law has something called the pre-existing duty rule, which says that a modification to a contract needs consideration to be valid. But wait, in this case, the contract price was increased because of a price increase in materials. So, was there consideration for the modification?

Alternatively, I think about the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which might apply here because structural steel could be considered goods. Under UCC 2-209, a contract can be modified without consideration if the modification is in good faith. But I'm not sure if that applies here because the contract is for construction, which is a service contract, not a sale of goods. So maybe the UCC doesn't apply, and we're under common law.

Under common law, any modification needs consideration. So, if the builder is just agreeing to do the same work but for an extra million because their costs went up, is that a valid modification? The problem is that the builder is asking for more money for the same work, so the company isn't getting anything extra. So, did the builder provide any new consideration? It doesn't seem like it. They're just demanding more payment for the same obligations.

Wait, but the event here was a tornado causing the price increase. Does that count as an unforeseen event that would allow for a modification without consideration? Or maybe it's a case of impracticability or frustration, but those doctrines usually allow for excuse of performance, not just a price increase. 

Another thought: the parol evidence rule and the Statute of Frauds. The original contract was for $100 million, which I assume is in writing since construction contracts usually are. Modifying it orally—would that be enforceable? The Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing, but I think modifications to contracts aren't necessarily required to be in writing unless the original contract says so. So, the oral agreement might be okay in terms of the Statute of Frauds.

Looking at the answer options, option B says no because there's no consideration for the modification. That seems relevant because, under common law, without consideration, the modification isn't binding. The company's promise to pay an extra million without getting anything new doesn't have consideration. So the modification wouldn't be enforceable.

Option E says yes because the modification was fair and equitable. But fairness alone isn't enough if there's no consideration. So without consideration, the modification isn't valid under common law.

Option I says yes because the company was aware and agreed verbally. But again, the issue is consideration, not just mutual agreement.

Option J says no because the builder should have anticipated price fluctuations. That's a possibility. Builders usually account for such risks in their pricing, so maybe they can't now demand more because of that. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here. The main issue is the legal enforceability of the modification, not whether it's fair or anticipated.

So, putting it all together: Without consideration, the oral modification isn't binding. The builder can't enforce the extra million because there's no new consideration from the company. Therefore, the answer should be B.

The question revolves around the enforceability of an oral modification to a fixed-price construction contract. Under common law, modifications to contracts generally require consideration to be valid. Here, the builder and the company orally agreed to increase the contract price by $1 million due to a 20% increase in structural steel costs caused by a tornado. However, the builder did not provide any new consideration for this modification—it simply demanded more money for the same work. Without new consideration, the modification lacks legal enforceability under the pre-existing duty rule.

While the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) allows for modifications without consideration in good faith under certain circumstances (e.g., UCC §2-209), this case likely falls under common law because it involves a service contract (construction) rather than a sale of goods. The oral agreement does not appear to violate the Statute of Frauds, but the absence of consideration is the critical issue. Fairness or mutual agreement alone cannot substitute for the requirement of consideration.

Thus, the oral modification is not enforceable, and the builder cannot recover the additional $1 million. The correct answer is:

**B: No, because there was no consideration for the modification of the contract.**
