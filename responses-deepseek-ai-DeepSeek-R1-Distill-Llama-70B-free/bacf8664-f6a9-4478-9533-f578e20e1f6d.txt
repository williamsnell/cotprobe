Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether 1/4 and 1/13 are in the Cantor set. I remember the Cantor set is also called the ternary set because it's related to base 3. Let me think about how the Cantor set is constructed.

The Cantor set starts with the interval [0,1]. In the first step, we remove the middle third, so we're left with [0,1/3] and [2/3,1]. Then, each of those intervals is split again, removing their middle thirds. This process continues infinitely.

To check if a number is in the Cantor set, I think it's about whether its base 3 expansion doesn't contain a 1. Because every time we remove the middle third, those numbers have a 1 in their ternary expansion. So the Cantor set consists of numbers in [0,1] that can be expressed in base 3 without using the digit 1.

Let's start with 1/4. I need to convert 1/4 into base 3. Hmm, how do I do that? Well, I remember that to convert a decimal fraction to base 3, I can multiply by 3 and take the integer part each time.

So for 1/4:

1/4 * 3 = 0.75 → the integer part is 0, so the first digit after the decimal is 0.
0.75 * 3 = 2.25 → integer part 2 → next digit is 2.
0.25 * 3 = 0.75 → integer part 0 → next digit 0.
0.75 again, so the next digits will repeat: 2, 0, 2, 0, etc.

So 1/4 in base 3 is 0.\overline{02}, where the bar is over 02. So the digits are 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2... So no 1s here. That means 1/4 is in the Cantor set.

Wait, but wait a minute. I thought that the endpoints of the removed intervals are excluded, but sometimes they are included. Do I need to worry about that? For example, 1/3 is an endpoint. 1/3 in base 3 is 0.1, which would mean it's excluded because it has a 1. But wait, no, the standard Cantor set includes the endpoints because they are the start and end points of each remaining interval. Wait, no, wait: when you remove the middle third, the endpoints are kept. So 1/3 is in the Cantor set because it's the endpoint of [0,1/3], which is kept in the first iteration.

Wait, but in base 3, 1/3 is 0.1, which is a 1. So according to the rule, numbers with 1s are excluded. But 1/3 is included in the Cantor set. So maybe the rule is that if the expansion contains a 1, it's excluded, except for numbers that can be expressed without a 1 in some way.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the Cantor set contains all numbers in [0,1] that can be expressed in base 3 without using the digit 1. So, if a number has a 1 in any position of its ternary expansion, it's not in the Cantor set.

So, 1/4 is 0.020202... in base 3, so no 1s. So it's in the Cantor set.

Now, what about 1/13? Let's convert 1/13 into base 3.

1/13 is approximately 0.076923 in decimal. Let's compute its base 3 expansion.

Multiply 1/13 by 3: 3/13 ≈ 0.230769 → integer part 0, so first digit is 0.
0.230769 *3 = 0.692307 → integer part 0 → next digit 0.
0.692307 *3 = 2.076923 → integer part 2 → next digit 2.
0.076923 *3 = 0.230769 → integer part 0 → next digit 0.
0.230769 *3 = 0.692307 → integer part 0 → next digit 0.
0.692307 *3 = 2.076923 → integer part 2 → next digit 2.
0.076923 → this looks like a repeating cycle.

So putting it together, 1/13 in base 3 is 0.\overline{0020}, where the bar is over 0020. Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, let's recount:

1st step: 1/13 *3 = 3/13 → 0. So digit 0.
Fraction: 3/13 → 0.230769.

2nd step: 0.230769 *3 = 0.692307 → digit 0.
Fraction: 0.692307.

3rd step: *3 → 2.076923 → digit 2.
Fraction: 0.076923.

4th step: *3 → 0.230769 → digit 0.
Fraction: 0.230769.

5th step: *3 → 0.692307 → digit 0.
Fraction: 0.692307.

6th step: *3 → 2.076923 → digit 2.
Fraction: 0.076923 → same as step 3.

So the pattern repeats every four digits: 0,0,2,0, then 0,0,2,0 again.

So the base 3 expansion is 0.002020002020... So the digits are 0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2... etc.

So, looking for any digit 1 in the expansion. There are none. So according to the rule, 1/13 is in the Cantor set.

Wait, but wait another moment. I'm a bit confused because sometimes the ternary expansion might have a 1 in a different representation. For example, 1/4 is 0.020202... which is correct, but what about 1/13?

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach. Let me list the Cantor set's elements as numbers that can be expressed in base 3 with digits only 0 and 2. So, if 1/13 can be expressed that way, it's in.

But wait, the expansion I got was 0.002020002... which indeed only has 0s and 2s. So that suggests 1/13 is in the Cantor set.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes the ternary expansion might have a 1 if you represent it differently. For example, numbers like 1/4 can also be written as 0.0222222... in base 3, which is equal to 0.1 in base 3. But in base 3, 0.02222... equals 0.1, so 1/4 is 0.020202... or 0.02222...? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute 0.02222... base 3. That's equal to 2/3 * (1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + ... ) = 2/3 * (1/2) ) = 1/3. Oh wait, so 0.02222... is 1/3, which is 0.1 in base 3. So 1/4 is not equal to 1/3. So that suggests that 1/4 is 0.020202..., which doesn't have any 1s, so it is in the Cantor set.

So, both 1/4 and 1/13 would be in the Cantor set. So the answers would be [1,1].

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is [1,1], which would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another way to think about it: the Cantor set includes numbers that can be written without 1s in their ternary expansions, including fractions that have non-terminating expansions. So, if 1/4 and 1/13 both have such expansions, they're in.

But I'm a bit confused because I remember that the numbers removed are those with a 1 in their ternary expansions. So, in the first removal, the middle third (1/3, 2/3) is removed. So, any number in (1/3, 2/3) is not in the Cantor set.

Wait, but 1/4 is 0.25, which is less than 1/3 (~0.3333), so it's in the first interval [0,1/3]. Then, in the second iteration, [0,1/3] is split into [0,1/9] and [2/9,1/3]. 1/4 is approximately 0.25, which is 2.25/9, which is between 2/9 (~0.2222) and 1/3 (~0.3333). So, 1/4 is in the second interval [2/9, 1/3], so it's kept in the second iteration.

In the third iteration, [2/9,1/3] is split into [2/9,7/27] and [8/27,1/3]. 1/4 is 0.25, which is 7.875/27, so it's in [7/27 (~0.259), 8/27 (~0.296)], but wait: 0.25 is 6.75/27. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, 2/9 is about 0.2222, 7/27 is approximately 0.259, and 8/27 is approximately 0.296. 1/4 is 0.25, which is between 7/27 and 8/27? Wait, no, 7/27 is ~0.259, which is larger than 0.25, so 0.25 is less than 7/27. So actually, 1/4 is between 2/9 (0.222) and 7/27 (~0.259). So, during the third iteration, the middle third of [2/9,1/3] is removed, which is ( (2/9 + 1/3)/2 ) = ( (2/9 + 3/9)/2 ) = (5/9)/2 = 5/18 ≈ 0.2778. So the middle third to remove is (2/9 + 1/27, 7/27 + 1/27) ?

Wait, no, the middle third of [2/9, 1/3] is [2/9 + (1/3 - 2/9)/3, 2/9 + 2*(1/3-2/9)/3 ].

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 1/4 in base 3. Since I already did that, and it's 0.020202..., which doesn't have any 1s, so 1/4 is definitely in the Cantor set.

Now, 1/13 is approximately 0.076923. Let's see which intervals it falls into.

First, [0,1/3] is kept. 0.0769 is less than 1/3, so it's in the first interval.

Next, in the second iteration, [0,1/9] and [2/9,1/3]. 0.0769 is less than 1/9 (~0.1111), so it's in [0,1/9].

Third iteration: [0,1/27] and [2/27,1/9]. 0.0769 is 2/27 (~0.07407) and 1/9 (~0.1111). 2/27 is approximately 0.074, so 0.0769 is greater than 2/27, so it's in [2/27, 1/9].

Fourth iteration: Split [2/27, 1/9] into [2/27, 7/81] and [8/81, 1/9].

Compute 7/81: 7 ÷ 81 ≈ 0.086419753. 8/81 ≈ 0.098765432.

1/13 ≈ 0.076923 is less than 7/81, so it's in [2/27, 7/81].

Wait, 2/27 is about 0.07407, 7/81 is ≈0.086419753.

So 0.07692 is between 0.07407 and 0.08641975, so it's in the first sub-interval [2/27,7/81].

Now, in the next iteration, we split [2/27,7/81] into three parts. The middle third is removed.

But regardless, since we're only checking whether the number is in the Cantor set, and each time we're narrowing down the interval, but the key point is that in base 3, 1/13 doesn't have any 1s, so it's in the Cantor set.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 1/13's base 3 expansion is 0.002020002..., which doesn't have any 1s. So it should be in the Cantor set.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the base 3 conversion. Let me double-check.

1/13 = ?

Let me compute it step by step:

1/13 = 0.076923076923... in decimal.

To convert to base 3:

Multiply by 3: 0.076923 *3 = 0.230769 → integer part 0, so first digit 0. Remainder 0.230769.

Multiply by 3: 0.230769 *3 = 0.692307 → integer part 0. Second digit 0. Remainder 0.692307.

Multiply by 3: 0.692307 *3 = 2.076923 → integer part 2. Third digit 2. Remainder 0.076923.

Now, this is where the cycle starts again, because we're back to 0.076923.

So the digits so far are 0, 0, 2.

Now, multiply 0.076923 by3: 0.230769 → digit 0.

Multiply by3: 0.692307 → digit 0.

Multiply by3: 2.076923 → digit 2.

So the pattern is 0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,... So the base 3 expansion is 0.002020002020... So no 1s, so 1/13 is in the Cantor set.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting results. Because according to the intervals, 1/13 is in the Cantor set. But wait, when you think about the ternary expansion, it's only 0s and 2s, so it should be in.

But wait, earlier I thought 1/4 is 0.020202..., which is in, and 1/13 is 0.002020..., which is also in. So both would be 1s, so the answer would be [1,1], which is option H.

But wait, looking back, let me think again. Because I've heard that the Cantor set doesn't include numbers like 1/4. No, that's not right. Let's check 1/4: 0.020202... in base 3, which is allowed. So it's in.

Wait, but what about 1/3? Its base 3 is 0.1, which has a 1, so it's not in? No, wait, 1/3 is an endpoint and is included in the Cantor set. Wait, that's confusing. Because according to the ternary rule, it would have a 1, but in reality, it's kept because it's the endpoint. So perhaps the rule is that numbers that can be expressed without any 1s are in, but those that have an infinite expansion with 1s are excluded, but those with terminating expansions (like 0.1 in base 3, which is 1/3) are also excluded. Wait, no, because 1/3 is in the Cantor set. So maybe the rule is that if any digit after the decimal in base 3 is 1, and it's not part of a terminating expansion that ends with a 1, then it's excluded.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just stick with the base 3 expansion. 1/4 is 0.020202... which has no 1s, so it's in. 1/13 is 0.002020... which also has no 1s, so it's in. Therefore, the answers are [1,1], which corresponds to option H.

To determine whether \( \frac{1}{4} \) and \( \frac{1}{13} \) belong to the Cantor set, we analyze their base 3 (ternary) expansions. The Cantor set consists of numbers in \([0,1]\) that can be expressed in base 3 without using the digit 1.

### Analysis of \( \frac{1}{4} \):
1. Convert \( \frac{1}{4} \) to base 3:
   - \( \frac{1}{4} \times 3 = 0.75 \), integer part = 0.
   - \( 0.75 \times 3 = 2.25 \), integer part = 2.
   - \( 0.25 \times 3 = 0.75 \), integer part = 0.
   - The cycle repeats, giving \( \frac{1}{4} = 0.\overline{02} \) in base 3.

Since the base 3 expansion of \( \frac{1}{4} \) contains only the digits 0 and 2, with no 1s, \( \frac{1}{4} \) is in the Cantor set.

### Analysis of \( \frac{1}{13} \):
1. Convert \( \frac{1}{13} \) to base 3:
   - \( \frac{1}{13} \times 3 = 0.230769 \), integer part = 0.
   - \( 0.230769 \times 3 = 0.692307 \), integer part = 0.
   - \( 0.692307 \times 3 = 2.076923 \), integer part =
