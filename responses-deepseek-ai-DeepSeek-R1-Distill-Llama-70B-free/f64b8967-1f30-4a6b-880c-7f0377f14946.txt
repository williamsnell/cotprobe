Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron moving in an electric field. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says an electron is released from rest and moves a distance of 10 cm in 1e-7 seconds. We need to find the electric field strength and the voltage between the two points. The options are given from A to J, each with different values for the electric field in statV/cm and voltage in volts.

Wait, statV/cm? Oh right, statvolts per centimeter is a unit for electric field strength. And voltage is in volts. So first, I think I need to find the electric field, E, and then calculate the potential difference, V, using the relation V = E * d, where d is the distance between the points.

But wait, the electric field can also be found by knowing the acceleration of the electron. Because in an electric field, the force on the electron is F = e * E. And since F = m * a, where m is mass and a is acceleration, combining these gives E = (m * a) / e.

So I need to compute the acceleration of the electron as it moves. The electron starts from rest, so initial velocity u = 0. It moves a distance s = 10 cm = 0.1 meters in a time t = 1e-7 seconds. 

Hmm, I remember that when you have initial velocity zero, the distance covered in time t under constant acceleration is s = 0.5 * a * t². So I can solve for a here.

Let me plug in the numbers: s = 0.5 * a * t² → a = 2s / t².

Substituting the values: s is 0.1 m, t is 1e-7 s.

So a = (2 * 0.1) / (1e-7)^2 → 0.2 / (1e-14) → 0.2e14 m/s². Wait, 0.2 times 1e14 is 2e13 m/s²? That seems really high, but I think it's correct because the time is very short.

Now, E is (m * a) / e. The mass of the electron m is 9.11e-31 kg. The charge e is 1.6e-19 coulombs.

So E = (9.11e-31 kg * 2e13 m/s²) / 1.6e-19 C.

Let me compute the numerator first: 9.11e-31 * 2e13 = 1.822e-17.

Divide by 1.6e-19: 1.822e-17 / 1.6e-19 = (1.822 / 1.6) * 1e2 → approximately 1.13875 * 100 → 113.875.

So E ≈ 114 V/m? Wait, but the options are in statV/cm. Oh, wait, I'm getting confused with the units. Because electric field can be in volts per meter or in statvolts per centimeter. I need to make sure about the conversion between these units.

Wait, 1 V/m is equal to 10^6 V/m in terms of cm, because 1 m is 100 cm. So 1 V/m = 10^4 statV/cm? Or wait, no. Let me think. Because 1 V/m is 1 volt per 100 cm, so that's 0.01 V/cm. Hmm, so 1 V/m is 0.01 statV/cm, right? Because statV/cm is volts per centimeter.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, because 1 V/m is 1 V per 100 cm, so that's 0.01 V per cm. So 1 V/m = 0.01 statV/cm. Therefore, if I have E = 114 V/m, then in statV/cm that's 114 * 0.01 = 1.14 statV/cm. Wait, but looking at the options, none have that. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me recheck the calculation. Let's go through the steps again.

First, acceleration. s = 0.5 a t² → a = 2s/(t²). s is 0.1 m, t is 1e-7 s. So:

a = (2 * 0.1) / (1e-7)^2 = 0.2 / (1e-14) = 2e13 m/s².

Then E = (m a) / e.

m = 9.11e-31 kg.

a = 2e13 m/s².

So m*a = 9.11e-31 * 2e13 = 1.822e-17 kg·m/s².

e is 1.6e-19 C.

So E = 1.822e-17 / 1.6e-19 = (1.822 / 1.6) * 1e2.

1.822 / 1.6 is about 1.13875. Multiply by 1e2 gives 113.875 V/m.

So E = ~113.875 V/m.

Wait, but wait, the unit conversion. Because 1 V/m is 0.01 statV/cm. So 113.875 V/m = 113.875 * 0.01 = 1.13875 statV/cm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G: 3.6e-3 statV/cm and 12 V. Wait, no, that's 0.0036, which is way smaller. None of the options have 1.14 statV/cm. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

Hmm, wait, let me check my approach again. Maybe I should use the formula E = (v^2)/(d), but no, because the electron is accelerating from rest. Alternatively, perhaps I should find the velocity first, then use E = (v)/(μ * t), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The electric field E can be found using the relation E = (1/2) m v²/(e d). Because the work done by the electric field is eEd = kinetic energy gained, which is 1/2 mv².

But wait, because the electron starts from rest, the final velocity v can be found from the kinematic equation. Since u=0, v = (2s)/t, because average velocity is s/t, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, let's think about velocity. The distance moved under constant acceleration is s = 0.5 a t². Then the velocity can be found using v = a t. Hmm, that's correct.

So v = a t = (2e13 m/s²) * (1e-7 s) = 2e6 m/s. Wait, that's 2 million meters per second, which seems high. Hmm, but let me check:

a = 2e13, t = 1e-7, so a*t = 2e13 * 1e-7 = 2e6 m/s. Yes, that's correct.

Then, the kinetic energy is 1/2 mv². Which should equal e E d.

So 1/2 m v² = e E d.

Solving for E: E = (m v²) / (2 e d).

Plugging the numbers:

m = 9.11e-31 kg,

v = 2e6 m/s,

d = 0.1 m,

e = 1.6e-19 C.

So numerator is 9.11e-31 * (2e6)^2 = 9.11e-31 * 4e12 = 3.644e-18.

Denominator is 2 * 1.6e-19 * 0.1 = 3.2e-20.

So E = 3.644e-18 / 3.2e-20 ≈ 113.875 V/m, same as before. So that's correct.

So E ≈ 113.875 V/m. Now, converting that to statV/cm. Wait, what is 1 statV/cm? Oh, I think 1 V/m is 10^6 V/m in terms of cm. Wait, no, no. Let me think about unit conversion. 1 V/m is 1 V per 100 cm, so 0.01 V/cm. So 1 V/m = 0.01 statV/cm.

So E = 113.875 V/m = 113.875 * 0.01 = 1.13875 statV/cm.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 1.1 statV/cm. The closest options are perhaps option G: 3.6e-3. Hmm, that's 0.0036, which is way lower. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, alternative approach: Maybe I should have used E = F/e, but F is ma.

Wait, maybe I confused the direction, but the magnitude should be correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong units somewhere. Maybe I should calculate the electric field in different units.

Wait, another approach: In cgs units, the electric field can be calculated with different constants. Let me think again. In the cgs system, F = q E, but the units are different.

Wait, maybe I should have used the formula with acceleration a = e E / m, which is correct in SI units. So E = (m a)/e, which I did. So why am I getting E in V/m, and the options are in statV/cm.

Wait, maybe I should express E in statvolts/cm. How do I convert V/m to statV/cm?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about unit conversion.

In SI units, 1 V/m = 1 N/(C·m). In cgs units, 1 statV/cm is equal to 1 erg/(esu·cm) = 1 dyne/esu. Since 1 dyne = 1e-5 N, and 1 esu is 1e-10 C (approximately, since 1 C = 2.998e9 esu). Wait, I'm not sure, perhaps it's better to look for a direct conversion factor between V/m and statV/cm.

I recall that 1 V/m is equal to 10^-6 statV/cm. Or wait, let me get this straight.

Wait, 1 V = 1 J/C = (kg·m²/s²·C⁻¹). In cgs, 1 statV = 1 erg/esu = (g·cm²/s²)/(esu). Since 1 erg is g·cm²/s², and 1 esu is (g^(1/2) cm^(3/2) s⁻¹) ) or something like that. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to use the conversion factor.

I think that 1 V/m is equal to 3.336e-5 statV/cm. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps 1 V/m is 10^6 V/m in centimeters, so 1 V/m is 0.01 statV/cm, because 1 m is 100 cm, so per cm it's 0.01 V. Wait, but that doesn't involve statvolts. Alternatively, perhaps 1 statV/cm is equal to 3.0e8 V/m. Wait, no, think about the units.

Wait, another approach: The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s, which in cm/s is 3e10 cm/s. In cgs units, E in statvolts/cm can be related to the speed of light. Because in cgs, E (statvolts/cm) = (force in dynes)/(charge in esu). And since F = q E, but the units are different.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a direct conversion. I think that 1 V/m is equal to 3.0e-5 statV/cm. Let me see:

1 V/m = (1 J/C)/m = (kg·m²/s²·C⁻¹)/m = kg·m/(s²·C).

In cgs, 1 statV/cm is (erg/esu)/cm. Erg is g·cm²/s², esu is sqrt(g·cm³/s²).

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I think that 1 V/m is equal to 3.0e-5 statV/cm.

If that's the case, then E in statV/cm would be 113.875 V/m * 3e-5 statV/(V·cm) per (V/m). Wait, no, perhaps 1 V/m = (1/3e8) statV/cm. Because 1 m = 100 cm, and 1 V = 1/(3e8) statV? Not quite, perhaps it's better to use the exact conversion.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the fact that 1 Tesla (the unit for magnetic field) is 10^4 gauss in cgs, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, I can use the relation between the units of E in V/m and statV/cm.

I found online once that 1 V/m = 3.0e-5 statV/cm. So if E is 113.875 V/m, then in statV/cm, it would be 113.875 * 3e-5.

Wait, let me compute that: 113.875 * 3e-5 = 0.00341325 statV/cm. That would be approximately 3.41325e-3 statV/cm.

Looking at the options, option G is 3.6e-3, which is close. But let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 113.875 V/m * (3e-5 statV/cm per V/m) = 113.875 * 3e-5.

Compute 113.875 * 3 = 341.625, then multiply by 1e-5: 0.00341625 statV/cm.

So approximately 3.416e-3 statV/cm.

Looking at the options:

Option G: 3.6e-3 statV/cm and 12 V.

Option C: 3e-3 and 10 V.

Hmm, our calculation gives approximately 3.416e-3, so option G is closer at 3.6e-3. But perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the conversion factor. Another source says 1 V/m = 3.0e-5 statV/cm. So yes, that's correct.

So E is approximately 3.416e-3 statV/cm. So the closest option is G: 3.6e-3 statV/cm.

Now, for the voltage between the two points, which is V = E * d.

Wait, but E is in V/m, and d is in meters, so V = E (V/m) * d (m) = E (V/m) * d.

Wait, no, because V is E times distance. So E is 113.875 V/m, d is 0.1 m. So V = 113.875 * 0.1 = 11.3875 V.

Looking at the options, option G has 12 V, which is close. But wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, using E in statV/cm and d in cm. Because E is 3.416e-3 statV/cm, and d is 10 cm.

So V = E (statV/cm) * d (cm) = 3.416e-3 * 10 = 0.03416 statV. Wait, that can't be right because 0.034 V is much lower than the other option.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing units again. V in volts would be E (V/m) times d (m) = 113.875 V/m * 0.1 m = 11.3875 V.

So the potential difference is approximately 11.4 V. Looking at the options, option B is 11.4 V with E=3.8e-3, and option G is 12 V with E=3.6e-3. Our E is 3.416e-3 and V is 11.4.

Wait, but according to the calculation, E is about 3.416e-3 statV/cm, which is between option G (3.6) and option C (3.0). The voltage is 11.4 V, which matches option B's voltage, but option B's E is higher (3.8e-3). Hmm, perhaps I messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the conversion factor once again. Maybe the factor is different. Let me think: 1 statV/cm is equal to 3.0e8 V/m. Because in cgs units, 1 statV/cm equals (1 erg/esu)/cm, and 1 erg is 1e-7 J, 1 esu is 1e-10 C. So (1e-7 J / 1e-10 C) per cm → (1e3 J/C) per 0.01 m → 1e5 V/m per 0.01 m? Wait, no, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, the conversion factor between E in V/m and E in statV/cm is given by 1 V/m = 3.0e-5 statV/cm. So E = 113.875 V/m = 113.875 * 3e-5 statV/cm = 0.00341325 statV/cm. Hmm, that's about 3.41e-3.

So the closest option is G, which is 3.6e-3 and 12.0 V. But wait, our voltage is 11.4 V, which is option B's voltage, but option B's E is 3.8e-3. Hmmm, but perhaps I messed up the calculation of the voltage.

Wait, no, the voltage is E in V/m times distance in meters. 113.875 V/m * 0.1 m = 11.3875 V, which is approximately 11.4 V. So the correct voltage is 11.4 V.

Looking back at the options, option B has 11.4 V but E is 3.8e-3, which is higher than our calculated 3.41e-3.

Hmm, perhaps I made an error in calculating E. Let me go back.

Wait, when I calculated E in V/m, I got 113.875 V/m
