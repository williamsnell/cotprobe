Okay, so I've got this question about Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Hmm, I remember that Maslow was a psychologist who developed this theory about what motivates people. The hierarchy is like a pyramid, right? Starting from the most basic needs at the bottom to more complex ones at the top.

The question asks what each person is motivated by according to Maslow. The options are A through J. Let me think about each option.

Option A says solely by physical needs. Wait, no, because the hierarchy includes more than just physical. There's safety, love, esteem, and self-actualization. So A is probably wrong.

Option B is about striving for self-actualization and personal growth. That sounds familiar. I think self-actualization is the top of the pyramid, where people seek to fulfill their potential. So this might be part of the motivation, but is it the sole motivator? Or is it part of a broader process?

Option C talks about primary and secondary needs. Primary as physical, secondary as emotional. I'm not sure if that's exactly how Maslow framed it. His hierarchy includes more levels, like safety, belonging, esteem, etc. So maybe C is too simplistic.

Option D says a constant state of dissatisfaction. That doesn't ring a bell. I don't think Maslow's theory is about being dissatisfied all the time. It's more about progressing through the needs as lower ones are met.

Option E is desire for power and dominance. I think that's more related to other theories, like maybe McClelland's acquired needs theory, where need for power is one of the motivations. So E might not be correct here.

Option F is about fulfilling societal expectations. I'm not sure where that fits. Maybe that's more related to social identity theory or something else. Doesn't directly tie to Maslow's hierarchy.

Option G mentions homeostasis needs determined by our inner self. Homeostasis is about maintaining balance, like physiological equilibrium, which is part of the basic needs. But I'm not sure if this is the main motivator in Maslow's view.

Option H says motivation comes from fear of failing to meet needs. That sounds a bit negative. I think Maslow's theory is more about moving towards growth rather than fear. So H might not be right.

Option I is desire to achieve in the eyes of others. That feels more like external validation, perhaps related to esteem needs, but again, not the overarching motivator.

Option J is about satisfying needs from the next step in the hierarchy. Oh wait, I remember that Maslow's theory says that once a lower need is met, the person is motivated by the next higher need. So each person is motivated to move up the hierarchy, addressing the next unmet need. So J sounds correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought B was about self-actualization. So maybe both B and J are correct? Let me think. The question is, what motivates each person? According to Maslow, the motivation is to fulfill the hierarchy step by step. So once lower needs are satisfied, the next level up becomes the motivator. So J says they're motivated by the next step. So J would be the correct answer.

Wait, but B says striving for self-actualization and personal growth. That is part of the highest level, but is that the only motivator? Or is the general idea that each person progresses through the hierarchy, so their motivation is to move to the next unmet need, regardless of the level. So J is more about the process, while B is about the top of the hierarchy.

The question is about what each person is motivated by in general. So Maslow's theory says that people are motivated to satisfy their needs in order, starting from the bottom. So the motivation is to fulfill the next level of needs once the current ones are met.

So the correct answer should be J: satisfying needs from the next step in the hierarchy.

The question asks about Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs and what motivates each person according to his theory. Maslow's hierarchy is a pyramid of needs, starting with basic physiological needs at the bottom and progressing to safety, love, esteem, and finally self-actualization at the top. The theory suggests that once lower-level needs are met, individuals are motivated to address the next higher-level need in the hierarchy.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect, as motivation is not solely based on physical needs; the hierarchy includes multiple levels.
- **B**: Partially correct, as self-actualization is part of the theory, but it is only the highest level, not the sole motivator.
- **C**: Incorrect, as it oversimplifies the hierarchy into just primary and secondary needs.
- **D**: Incorrect, as the theory is not about constant dissatisfaction but about progressing through needs.
- **E**: Incorrect, as the desire for power is more related to other theories, like McClelland's.
- **F**: Incorrect, as fulfilling societal expectations is not central to Maslow's hierarchy.
- **G**: Incorrect, as homeostasis is only part of the basic needs.
- **H**: Incorrect, as fear of failing is not the driving force in Maslow's theory.
- **I**: Incorrect, as achieving in the eyes of others relates to esteem needs but is not the overarching motivator.
- **J**: Correct, as it accurately reflects the idea that motivation comes from satisfying the next unmet need in the hierarchy.

Thus, the correct answer is that people are motivated to satisfy needs from the next step in the hierarchy.
