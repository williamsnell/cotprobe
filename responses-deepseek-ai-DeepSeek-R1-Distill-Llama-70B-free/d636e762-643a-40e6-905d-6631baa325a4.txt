Okay, so I have this calculus problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully again.

The problem says that f is a continuously differentiable real-valued function on the open interval (-1, 4). So that means f is smooth enough, and its derivative exists everywhere in that interval. They give me that f(3) equals 5, and the derivative f'(x) is greater than or equal to -1 for all x in that interval. The question is asking for the greatest possible value of f(0), and there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm. So I need to find the maximum possible value of f at 0 given these conditions.

I remember something about differential inequalities and using the Mean Value Theorem. Maybe I can apply that here. Let me think. So the function's derivative is bounded below by -1. That means the slope of the function can't be less than -1 anywhere in the interval. So the function can't be decreasing too steeply; its descent is limited.

I think I can set up some kind of inequality using the derivative condition. Since f' is ≥ -1, integrating that over an interval should give me information about f(x).

Wait, maybe using the Mean Value Theorem directly would help. The theorem states that if a function is continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b), then there exists some c in (a, b) such that f'(c) equals (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a).

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Alternatively, I can think about the function's behavior. Since f' ≥ -1, the function can't decrease faster than a line with slope -1. So over an interval from x=a to x=b, the maximum decrease in f would be if the derivative is exactly -1 throughout. So perhaps I can model the maximum possible f(0) by considering the steepest possible descent from 0 to 3, and then using the known value at 3 to find f(0).

Wait, but going from 0 to 3, if the function is decreasing as much as possible, that would give me the minimal value of f(0), not the maximum. Oh wait, no. Wait, we have f(3) =5. To find the maximum f(0), maybe the function increased as much as possible before 3, but I have to consider the constraints.

Wait, perhaps we can model f(0) by integrating the maximum possible increase from 0 to 3. But wait, the derivative is bounded below, not above. So f' ≥ -1 means that the function's slope is at least -1, but it could be higher. So the function can increase without bound, except for the constraint that at x=3, it's 5.

Wait, no, that can't be right because f is defined on (-1,4), but the only condition is on the derivative, and one point f(3)=5. So to find the maximum possible f(0), I think I need to maximize f(0) given that f(3)=5 and f' ≥ -1.

So maybe I can write an inequality that relates f(0) and f(3). Let's see.

The function's derivative f' is ≥ -1. So between x=0 and x=3, the function's slope can't be less than -1. So the maximum possible f(0) would be achieved when the function is increasing as much as possible from 0 to 3, but constrained by the derivative's lower bound. Wait, no, because if f' can be very large (since it's only bounded below), then the function could have a very steep increase from 0 to 3, making f(0) as large as possible. But wait, wait, no: because the function is going from 0 to 3, and f(3) is fixed at 5. So if the function increases rapidly from 0 to 3, then f(0) would be much lower than 5. But we want the maximum f(0), meaning that the function would have to be as high as possible at 0, so perhaps it decreases as little as possible from 0 to 3.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it this way: the function's maximum at 0 would occur when the function decreases as little as possible from 0 to 3. Since the derivative is ≥ -1, the function can't decrease faster than slope -1. So the minimal decrease would be when the derivative is exactly -1 over that interval. Because if the derivative is higher than -1, the function would decrease less, which would mean a higher value at 0.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. If f'(x) is greater than or equal to -1, then the steepest descent is -1. So the function can't drop more than that. So the minimal possible drop from 0 to 3 would be if f' is exactly -1 over that interval. That is, the function decreases at the maximum allowed rate.

So if we model the function from x=0 to x=3 as f(x) = f(0) + ∫ from 0 to x of f'(t) dt. Since f'(t) ≥ -1, the minimal possible value of f(3) would be f(0) + (-1)*(3-0) = f(0) -3. But wait, f(3) is given as 5. So 5 ≥ f(0) -3. So 5 ≥ f(0) -3 → f(0) ≤ 8.

Wait, so that would give f(0) ≤ 8. So the maximum possible value of f(0) is 8. So looking at the options, option H is 8.

But wait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Let me think again. If the function's derivative is at least -1, then the function can't decrease faster than a slope of -1. So over the interval from 0 to 3, the maximum possible decrease is 3 units (because 3-0=3, multiplied by slope -1 gives -3). So the function could go from f(0) to f(3)=5 by decreasing by 3 units. So f(0) = 5 +3 =8.

But wait, could the function's derivative be larger than -1 in some places and exactly -1 in others, leading to a higher f(0)? No, because if the function's derivative is higher than -1, that means the function is not decreasing as much; so f(3) would be higher than 5, but we know that f(3) is fixed at 5. So to maximize f(0), we need the function to decrease as much as possible from 0 to 3, which is when f'(x)=-1 over that interval.

So yes, that gives f(0)=8, which is option H.

I think that's the correct approach. So the answer should be H:8.

To determine the greatest possible value of \( f(0) \), we analyze the given conditions: \( f \) is continuously differentiable on \((-1, 4)\), \( f(3) = 5 \), and \( f'(x) \geq -1 \) for all \( x \) in the interval. The derivative condition \( f'(x) \geq -1 \) implies that the function cannot decrease faster than a slope of \(-1\).

To maximize \( f(0) \), we consider the interval from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 3 \). The function's decrease over this interval is bounded by the condition \( f'(x) \geq -1 \). If the function decreases at the maximum allowed rate (i.e., \( f'(x) = -1 \)), the decrease in \( f(x) \) over the interval \( [0, 3] \) would be:

\[
f(3) = f(0) + \int_0^3 f'(x) \, dx \leq f(0) + (-1)(3-0).
\]

Since \( f(3) = 5 \), we have:

\[
5 \leq f(0) - 3.
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
f(0) \leq 8.
\]

Thus, the greatest possible value of \( f(0) \) is 8. This occurs when \( f(x) \) decreases at the maximum rate of \(-1\) over the interval \( [0, 3] \), consistent with the given conditions.

The correct answer is **H: 8**.
