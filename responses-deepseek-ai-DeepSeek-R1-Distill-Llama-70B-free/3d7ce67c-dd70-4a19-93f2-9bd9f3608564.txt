Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that one cubic foot of oxygen is being compressed adiabatically to 0.4 cubic feet. I need to find the resulting temperature and pressure after this process. Then, I have to figure out what the pressure and temperature would be if the process were isothermal instead. The options are given from A to J, each with two sets of values.

First, let's break down the problem. I remember that for adiabatic processes, no heat is exchanged with the surroundings, so Q=0. The process follows the relation PV^γ = constant, where γ is the heat capacity ratio (Cp/Cv). For diatomic gases like oxygen, γ is around 1.4. Wait, is oxygen diatomic? Yeah, O2 is diatomic, so γ=1.4.

Let's think about the initial conditions. The initial volume V1 is 1 cubic foot, initial pressure P1 is 15 psia, and initial temperature T1 is 100°F. Wait, but in thermodynamics, temperatures are usually in absolute units—like Kelvin or Rankine. I think I need to convert Fahrenheit to Rankine. Oh right, the conversion is T(°R) = T(°F) + 459.67. So T1 is 100 + 459.67 = 559.67 °R.

In an adiabatic compression, the volume decreases from 1 ft³ to 0.4 ft³. So V2 = 0.4 V1. Wait, no, V2 is 0.4 ft³, and V1 is 1 ft³, so the ratio V2/V1 is 0.4.

The adiabatic equations I remember are:

T1 * V1^(γ-1) = T2 * V2^(γ-1)
and
P1 * V1^γ = P2 * V2^γ

So I can use either of these to find T2 and P2.

Let me start with the temperature. Using the first equation:

T2 = T1 * (V1/V2)^(γ-1)

V1 is 1, V2 is 0.4, so V1/V2 is 2.5. γ-1 is 0.4, so 2.5^0.4. Hmm, calculating exponents can be tricky without a calculator. Wait, 2.5^0.4... I think 2^0.4 is about 1.3195, and 3^0.4 is around 1.5157. But wait, wait. Let me think again. Alternatively, I can use logarithms. Let's think of it as e^(ln(2.5)*0.4). ln(2.5) is approximately 0.9163. Multiply by 0.4 gives 0.3665. e^0.3665 is roughly 1.442. So T2 is T1 times 1.442.

Wait, T1 is 559.67 °R. 559.67 * 1.442. Let's compute that. 500 * 1.442 is 721, and 59.67 * 1.442 is approximately 86. So total is around 807.67 °R. To convert back to Fahrenheit, subtract 459.67: 807.67 - 459.67 = 348°F. Hmm, but none of the options have 348°F. Wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I should double-check the exponent. Let me recalculate 2.5^0.4. Alternatively, I can think in terms of exact exponents. Let's see, 2.5 is 5/2, so (5/2)^0.4 is e^(0.4 * ln(5/2)) = e^(0.4 * 0.9163) = e^0.3665. As before, around 1.442. So that part seems correct.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong formula. Another approach: For an adiabatic process, T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1)^( (γ-1)/γ ). Alternatively, since we have volumes, perhaps the way I did it is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The relation is T1 * V1^(γ-1) = T2 * V2^(γ-1). So T2 = T1 * (V1 / V2)^(γ-1). So yes, that's correct.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should compute (V1/V2)^(γ). Let me compute the ratio for pressure first because maybe that's easier.

For pressure, P2 = P1 * (V1 / V2)^γ. So V1 is 1, V2 is 0.4, so ratio is 2.5. γ=1.4. So 2.5^1.4. Hmm, what's 2.5^1.4?

Wait, 2.5^1 is 2.5, 2.5^2 is 6.25. 1.4 is between 1 and 2, so it's somewhere between 2.5 and 6.25. Alternatively, using logarithms again.

ln(2.5)=0.9163. Multiply by 1.4: 0.9163 * 1.4 ≈ 1.283. e^1.283 is about 3.6. So P2 is 15 psia * 3.6 ≈ 54 psia. Hmm, looking at the options, that's around 54. Option C has 58, H has 54. So possible.

Wait, but earlier I calculated T2 as about 348°F, but none of the options have that. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let's try an alternative approach. For an adiabatic process, the temperature change can also be calculated using:

(T2 / T1) = (V1 / V2)^(γ-1)

So V1 is 1, V2 is 0.4. So (1/0.4) = 2.5.

γ is 1.4, so γ-1 is 0.4. So (2.5)^0.4 ≈ 1.442.

So T2 = 559.67 * 1.442 ≈ 807.67 R, which is 807.67 - 459.67 = 348 F.

Hmm, that's what I got earlier. But looking at the options, the highest temperature I see is option F at 380°F. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait, perhaps oxygen is a different gas? Wait, oxygen's γ is indeed around 1.4. So that shouldn't be the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between pressure and temperature. Because I found P2 to be around 54 psia. Let me see the options for P2. Option H is 54 psia, and the temperature is 350°F.

Wait, let's compute T2 using the pressure ratio. Because T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1) ^ [(γ-1)/γ].

So P2 is 54 psia, P1 is 15 psia. So ratio is 54/15 = 3.6.

(γ-1)/γ = 0.4/1.4 ≈ 0.2857.

So 3.6^0.2857. Let's compute that. Let me take natural logs.

ln(3.6) is about 1.2809. Multiply by 0.2857: 1.2809 * 0.2857 ≈ 0.366.

e^0.366 ≈ 1.442. So T2 = 559.67 R * 1.442 ≈ same as before, 807.67 R → 348°F.

Hmm, but the option H has 350°F, which is close. Maybe due to rounding. So perhaps the correct P2 is 54 psia and T2 is 350°F. So that would match option H.

Wait, but let me check the isothermal part now. Because the question also asks what would happen if the process were isothermal.

In an isothermal process, temperature remains constant. So T stays at 100°F (which is 559.67 R). The relation for pressure and volume in isothermal processes is P1 V1 = P2 V2.

So P2 = P1 * (V1 / V2) = 15 psia * (1 / 0.4) = 15 * 2.5 = 37.5 psia.

Looking at the options, option H's isothermal pressure is 37.5 psia. Yes, that's exactly what I got. So the isothermal case would have P=37.5 psia and T=100°F.

So for the adiabatic case, the pressure is 54 psia, temp 350°F; for the isothermal case, P=37.5 psia, T=100°F.

Looking back at the options, option H says 54.0 psia and 350°F, 37.5 psia and 100°F. That matches exactly.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated P2 for the adiabatic case as 54 psia, that's correct. So option H seems to be the right one.

But wait, let me just make sure. Let me recheck the calculation for P2.

P2 = P1 * (V1/V2)^γ.

V1=1, V2=0.4 → ratio=2.5.

γ=1.4.

So 2.5^1.4.

Let me compute 2.5^1.4 more accurately.

We can write 2.5^1.4 = e^(1.4 * ln(2.5)).

ln(2.5) is about 0.916291.

Multiply by 1.4: 0.916291 * 1.4 = 1.2832.

e^1.2832 is approximately e^1.28 ≈ 3.597, e^1.2832 ≈ 3.60. So P2=15 *3.6=54 psia. Correct.

For the temperature, as before, 559.67 * (2.5^0.4) = 559.67 * 1.442 ≈ 807.7 R → 348 F. Option H says 350 F, which is very close, probably due to rounding in intermediate steps.

So the correct answer is option H: 54.0 psia and 350°F for adiabatic, and 37.5 psia and 100°F for isothermal.

To solve the problem, we analyze the adiabatic and isothermal processes separately using the given initial conditions:  
- Initial pressure, \( P_1 = 15 \, \text{psia} \)  
- Initial volume, \( V_1 = 1 \, \text{ft}^3 \)  
- Initial temperature, \( T_1 = 100^\circ \text{F} = 559.67^\circ \text{R} \)  
- Final volume, \( V_2 = 0.4 \, \text{ft}^3 \)  
- Heat capacity ratio for oxygen, \( \gamma = 1.4 \).

### Adiabatic Process:
For an adiabatic process, the relations are:  
1. \( P_1 V_1^\gamma = P_2 V_2^\gamma \)  
2. \( T_1 V_1^{\gamma-1} = T_2 V_2^{\gamma-1} \)

#### Pressure Calculation:
Using \( P_2 = P_1 \left( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \right)^\gamma \):  
\[
P_2 = 15 \left( \frac{1}{0.4} \right)^{1.4} = 15 \cdot (2.5)^{1.4}
\]  
Approximating \( 2.5^{1.4} \approx 3.6 \):  
\[
P_2 = 15 \cdot 3.6 = 54.0 \, \text{psia}
\]

#### Temperature Calculation:
Using \( T_2 = T_1 \left( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \right)^{\gamma-1} \):  
\[
T_2 = 559.67 \cdot (2.5)^{0.4}
\]  
Approximating \( 2.5^{0.4} \approx 1.442 \):  
\[
T_2 = 559.67 \cdot 1.442 \approx 807.67^\circ \text{R}
\]  
Converting to \( ^\circ \text{F} \):  
\[
T_2 = 807.67 - 459.67 = 348.00^\circ \text{F}
\]  
This is very close to \( 350^\circ \text{F} \), likely due to rounding.

### Isothermal Process:
For an isothermal process, the relation is:  
\[
P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2
\]  
\[
P_2 = P_1 \left( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \right) = 15 \cdot \frac{1}{0.4} = 15 \cdot 2.5 = 37.5 \, \text{psia}
\]  
The temperature remains constant at \( T_2 = 100^\circ \text{F} \).

### Final Answer:
For the adiabatic process, the final state is \( P_2 = 54.0 \, \text{psia} \) and \( T_2 = 350^\circ \text{F} \).  
For the isothermal process, the final state is \( P_2 = 37.5 \, \text{psia} \) and \( T_2 = 100^\circ \text{F} \).  

The correct option is **H: 54.0 psia and 350°F, 37.5 psia and 100°F**.
