Question:

A veterinarian was the owner in fee of a 50-acre tract of farmland. The veterinarian contracted to sell her property to an investor for $300,000. The parties signed a written land-sale agreement that provided for 30 monthly installment payments of $10,000 each. According to the terms of the sale agreement, the veterinarian would deliver a warranty deed to the investor upon payment of the last installment. In accordance with state law, the farmland's land-sale agreement was properly recorded. After making the first 10 installment payments, the investor discovered that there was an unrecorded mortgage on the farmland. The veterinarian, who is the mortgagor, has regularly made her mortgage payments and is not in default. This jurisdiction has the following recording statute in effect:"No conveyance or instrument is good as against any subsequent purchaser for value and without notice, unless the same be recorded prior to subsequent purchase. "After the investor learned of the outstanding mortgage, he discontinued making further installment payments to the veterinarian. The investor alleged that the veterinarian was in breach of the land-sale agreement due to the existence of the unrecorded mortgage. The investor sues the veterinarian for breach of contract. Ifjudgment is rendered in favor of the veterinarian, it will be because

Options:

A: the recording statute does not apply to this situation since the investor was already making payments.
B: the investor was aware of the mortgage when he signed the contract.
C: the prior mortgage has no legal effect on the investor's rights under the installment land-sale agreement.
D: the investor did not properly inspect the property before purchase.
E: the time for the veterinarian, as seller, to deliver marketable title has not yet arrived.
F: although the land-sale agreement is actually a mortgage, it does not impair the investor's right of redemption.
G: the veterinarian is not in default of her mortgage payments, thus not affecting the investor's rights.
H: the investor has failed to fulfill his part of the contract by discontinuing the installment payments.
I: the veterinarian offered a warranty deed to the investor, securing his rights.
J: the installment land-sale agreement is a security device.

Okay, so I've got this question about real property law, specifically dealing with land-sale agreements and recording statutes. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The situation is that a veterinarian owns a 50-acre farmland and contracts to sell it to an investor for $300,000. They have a written land-sale agreement where the investor will make 30 monthly payments of $10,000 each. The vet will deliver a warranty deed after the last payment. The agreement was properly recorded as per state law.

After 10 payments, the investor finds out there's an unrecorded mortgage on the property. The vet is the mortgagor and has been making payments, not in default. The jurisdiction's recording statute says that a conveyance isn't valid against a subsequent purchaser for value without notice unless recorded before the subsequent purchase.

The investor stops making payments, claiming the vet breached the contract because of the unrecorded mortgage. He's suing for breach. The question is why the vet would win if the judgment is in her favor.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which reason would allow the vet to win. Let's think about each aspect.

First, the key points are about the recording statute and the effect of an unrecorded mortgage in a land-sale agreement. The vet is the seller, and the investor is the buyer under an installment agreement.

The recording statute here is a notice statute. So, it says that a conveyance is only valid against a subsequent purchaser for value without notice if it's recorded before that subsequent purchase. So, if someone buys without notice of a prior unrecorded interest, their interest is protected.

In this case, the vet had a mortgage, which is a lien on the property. The mortgage wasn't recorded, so when the investor bought the land under the installment agreement, he might be considered a subsequent purchaser. But wait, the land-sale agreement was recorded. Does that matter?

Wait, the mortgage was unrecorded when the investor entered into the agreement. The vet's mortgage was prior in time but not recorded. When the investor contracted to buy, he's a subsequent purchaser. Since the mortgage wasn't recorded, the investor, as a purchaser for value without notice, would take free of the mortgage, right? Because under the recording statute, the prior unrecorded conveyance (the mortgage) is not valid against the subsequent purchaser without notice.

But wait, in this scenario, the investor is buying through an installment agreement. So he's not getting the deed yet; he's paying in installments, and upon final payment, the deed is delivered. So during the installment period, does the investor have an interest in the land? Or is the vet still the legal owner until the final payment?

I think in an installment sale, the buyer (investor) gets equitable title, and the seller (vet) holds legal title until the final payment. So the investor's interest is that of a purchaser under an executory contract.

Now, the issue is whether the unrecorded mortgage affects the investor's rights. The vet is the mortgagor and is not in default, so the mortgagee (the lender) hasn't foreclosed yet.

In real property, the general rule is that a buyer is entitled to receive marketable title. Marketable title means that the title is free of encumbrances, like mortgages, that would affect the value or use of the property. If the seller can't provide a marketable title, the buyer can refuse to perform.

But the timing here is important. The vet is supposed to deliver the warranty deed upon the last installment payment. So the time for delivering marketable title hasn't arrived yet because the investor still has 20 more payments to make.

Wait, that's a key point. The land-sale agreement requires the vet to deliver the deed at the end. Until then, the investor doesn't have legal title, only equitable. So, the vet's obligation to deliver marketable title arises when the investor pays the last installment. Since the investor stopped paying after the 10th payment, the vet's obligation hasn't kicked in yet.

So, the investor is suing now, before the deed is delivered. The vet's duty to provide marketable title is at the time of the closing, which is when the last payment is made. Since that hasn't happened yet, the vet hasn't breached the contract because she hasn't failed to deliver marketable title yet.

Looking at the options, option E says: "the time for the veterinarian, as seller, to deliver marketable title has not yet arrived." That seems to fit because the vet is only required to deliver the deed and marketable title at the end of the 30 months. Since the investor stopped paying early, the vet's obligation to provide title hasn't been triggered.

Other options: Let's consider them briefly.

Option A: The recording statute doesn't apply because the investor was making payments. Not sure if that's correct. The statute applies to subsequent purchasers, and the investor is a subsequent purchaser because the mortgage was prior but unrecorded. But the timing is about when the investor's interest is recorded. Wait, the land-sale agreement was recorded, so that might affect things. But I'm not sure that's relevant here.

Option B: Investor knew about the mortgage. There's no indication in the facts that he knew, so probably not.

Option C: The prior mortgage has no effect on the investor's rights. But the mortgage is an encumbrance, so it would affect the title. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Investor didn't inspect. Maybe, but the issue is about the mortgage, which is a matter of record. If it's unrecorded, inspection wouldn't find it, but the recording statute protects the investor. So D might not be the reason.

Option E, as discussed, seems correct because the time for delivering title hasn't come yet.

Option F: The land-sale agreement is a mortgage. No, it's an installment sale, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Vet is not in default, so it doesn't affect investor. But the existence of the mortgage itself could affect title, regardless of whether the vet is in default.

Option H: Investor failed to fulfill contract by stopping payments. Well, the investor stopped because he thought the vet was in breach. If the vet wasn't in breach, then the investor's stopping would be a breach. But the question is why the vet would win, implying that the investor's claim of breach is invalid. So if the vet isn't required to provide title yet, she didn't breach, so the investor's stopping payments would be a breach, making H a possible answer. But the question is about why judgment is for the vet when the investor sues for breach. So if the vet didn't breach, the investor's claim fails, so the vet wins. So H could be an answer, but does it address the reason? H says the investor failed to fulfill the contract, which would make the investor in breach. But the question is about the vet's defense against the investor's claim. The investor is suing for breach, so the vet's defense would be that she didn't breach. So the reason would be E, not H. Because the vet's obligation to deliver title hasn't arisen yet, so she hasn't breached.

Option I: Warranty deed secures investor's rights. But the warranty deed is to be delivered at the end. The issue is about the mortgage affecting the title before that.

Option J: Installment agreement is a security device. Not sure, but the main point is about the timing of the title delivery.

So the correct answer should be E because the vet's duty to deliver marketable title hasn't yet arrived, so she hasn't breached the contract.

The question revolves around a land-sale agreement and the implications of an unrecorded mortgage on the property. The veterinarian (seller) and the investor (buyer) entered into an installment agreement, where the investor would make 30 monthly payments, and the veterinarian would deliver a warranty deed upon the final payment. After 10 payments, the investor discovered an unrecorded mortgage on the property and stopped making further payments, alleging a breach of contract by the veterinarian. The jurisdiction's recording statute protects subsequent purchasers for value without notice, but the key issue is whether the veterinarian has breached the contract.

The veterinarian's obligation to deliver marketable title arises only at the time of delivering the warranty deed, which is upon the last installment payment. Since the investor stopped payments after 10 installments, the veterinarian's duty to provide marketable title has not yet been triggered. Therefore, the veterinarian cannot be in breach of the contract at this stage. The investor's claim fails because the time for the veterinarian to deliver marketable title has not yet arrived.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**E: the time for the veterinarian, as seller, to deliver marketable title has not yet arrived.**

This reasoning aligns with the terms of the land-sale agreement and the timing of the veterinarian's obligations under the contract.
