Okay, so I have this question about paint coverage. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is: How much area, in square meters, will one liter of paint cover if it's brushed out to a uniform thickness of 100 microns?

Wait, I remember that paint coverage is related to volume and thickness. Oh right, the formula must involve converting the volume into a layer that covers a certain area with a specific thickness. So I think the formula is something like area equals volume divided by thickness. But wait, I need to make sure about the units here because liters and microns are involved.

So, one liter is 1 liter. I need to convert that into cubic meters because the area will be in square meters and the thickness is in meters. Oh yeah, 1 liter is 0.001 cubic meters. Because 1 cubic meter is 1000 liters, so 1 liter is 1/1000, which is 0.001 m³.

The thickness given is 100 microns. Wait, microns to meters. I remember that 1 micron is 1e-6 meters. So 100 microns is 100 times 1e-6, which is 1e-4 meters. So thickness is 0.0001 meters.

So putting it all together, the area should be volume divided by thickness. That's 0.001 m³ divided by 0.0001 m. Let me calculate that. 0.001 divided by 0.0001 is the same as 0.001 / 0.0001 = 10. So 10 square meters? Wait, but wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check the math.

Wait, 0.001 / 0.0001. Let's think in exponents. 0.001 is 1e-3, and 0.0001 is 1e-4. So 1e-3 divided by 1e-4 is 1e1, which is 10. Yeah, that seems right. So the area is 10 m².

Looking back at the options, option F is 10 m². So the answer should be F. But wait, am I missing anything here? Like, could the density of the paint affect this? Oh, right, but wait, paint's density is usually around water, but since the problem gives the volume as one liter, I think that's already accounted for. Because one liter is a volume measurement, and when you spread it out, the thickness is given, so no density is needed. So yeah, I think F is correct.

To determine how much area one liter of paint will cover when brushed out to a uniform thickness of 100 microns, we use the relationship between volume, thickness, and area. The formula is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\text{Volume}}{\text{Thickness}}
\]

1. **Convert the volume of paint to cubic meters**:  
   Since 1 liter = \( 0.001 \, \text{m}^3 \), the volume is \( 0.001 \, \text{m}^3 \).

2. **Convert the thickness to meters**:  
   100 microns = \( 100 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} = 0.0001 \, \text{m} \).

3. **Calculate the area**:  
   Substituting the values into the formula:  
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{0.001}{0.0001} = 10 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

Thus, one liter of paint will cover an area of \( 10 \, \text{m}^2 \) when applied to a uniform thickness of 100 microns.

The correct answer is **F: 10 m²**.
