Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about services marketing, I think. The question is about which concept is based on the idea that customer expectations shape their perception of the actual service encounter. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

Let me break down the question. It says that the concept is about customer expectations influencing their perception during the service encounter. So, the key terms here are expectations, perception, and service encounter.

I remember from my studies that in services marketing, there's a model called the Service Quality Model, or something like that. Oh wait, it's the Expectancy-Disconfirmation Model. Right, that's the one. This model suggests that customers have certain expectations before they receive a service, and their satisfaction is influenced by how the actual service compares to those expectations.

So the question is asking which term matches this idea. The options are A to J. Let me look through them. Option J is Service quality. That rings a bell because service quality is often defined as the difference between expected and perceived service. So the Service Quality concept is based on customer expectations affecting their perception of the service they receive.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Isn't there another term related to the actual experience? Like, the service encounter itself is the interaction, but the quality is about meeting expectations. So the question is about the perception being shaped by expectations, which ties directly to how quality is perceived.

Another thought: Service satisfaction (option H) might be about how satisfied they are after the service, which could be related but is more the outcome rather than the concept of expectations shaping perception. Service quality is more about the comparison between expectation and reality.

So putting it all together, the concept is Service Quality, which is option J.

The concept described in the question is Service Quality. This is because Service Quality is based on the idea that customer expectations influence their perception of the actual service encounter. It involves the comparison between expected service and the service actually delivered, which aligns with the Expectancy-Disconfirmation Model. 

Answer: J
