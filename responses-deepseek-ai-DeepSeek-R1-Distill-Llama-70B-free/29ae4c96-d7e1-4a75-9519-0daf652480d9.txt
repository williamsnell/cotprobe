The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The question, therefore, should be quickly settled, whether free colored persons, born and naturalized in this country, are not American citizens, and justly entitled to all the rights, privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states; and whether the Constitution of the United States makes or authorizes any invidious distinction with regard to the color or condition of free inhabitants.
"For myself, I have not the shadow of doubt on the subject. I believe that the rights of the free colored persons need only to be vindicated before the U.S. Supreme Court, to be obtained; that no prejudice or sophistry . . . can prevent their acknowledgement . . . and that the present laws, affecting your condition, are clearly unconstitutional. The fact that you have been treated, by common consent and common usage, as aliens and brutes, is not proof that such treatment is legal, but only shows the strength, the bitterness, and the blindness of prejudice."
—William Lloyd Garrison, "To the Free People of Color of the United States," The Liberator, January 15, 1831

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a Supreme Court decision that contradicted William Lloyd Garrison's argument. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what Garrison was arguing in the passage provided. The quote is from The Liberator in 1831. He's talking about free colored persons, saying they are American citizens entitled to all the rights, privileges, and immunities of citizens. He's confident that the Supreme Court would agree if their rights were vindicated there, and he believes the laws affecting them are unconstitutional. He also mentions that treating them as aliens and brutes isn't legal, just a result of prejudice.

So, Garrison is asserting that African Americans, even free ones, are citizens with equal rights under the Constitution. He's against any discrimination based on color or condition, believing the Constitution doesn't allow such distinctions.

The question is asking which Supreme Court case later contradicted this argument. So, I'm looking for a case where the Court ruled against the idea that African Americans were citizens with equal rights.

Looking at the options provided:

A: United States v. Nixon (1974) – This was about executive privilege and Watergate, not related to citizenship or race.
B: Miranda v. Arizona (1966) – Deals with Miranda rights, criminal procedure, not relevant here.
C: Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) – Right to an attorney, not about citizenship or race.
D: Marbury v. Madison (1803) – Establishing judicial review, not related.
E: Brown v. Board of Education (1954) – This overturned segregation, supporting equal rights, so it's the opposite of what we're looking for.
F: Ex parte Milligan (1866) – About military tribunals and due process, not directly about citizenship of African Americans.
G: Roe v. Wade (1973) – Abortion rights, unrelated.
H: Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) – This case upheld "separate but equal," allowing segregation, which contradicts equal rights. But wait, there's another case that might be more directly contradictory.
I: McCulloch v. Maryland (1819) – About federal power and state taxation, not related.
J: Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857) – This is the big one. The Dred Scott decision ruled that African Americans, whether free or enslaved, were not citizens and had no rights under the Constitution. This directly contradicts Garrison's argument.

So, the correct answer should be J: Dred Scott v. Sanford. It's the case where the Supreme Court ruled against African American citizenship, which is exactly what Garrison was arguing against.

The argument made by William Lloyd Garrison in the passage asserts that free colored persons are American citizens entitled to equal rights under the Constitution. The question asks which Supreme Court decision contradicted this argument. The correct answer is **Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857)**, as it ruled that African Americans were not citizens and had no rights under the Constitution, directly opposing Garrison's stance.

Answer: J
