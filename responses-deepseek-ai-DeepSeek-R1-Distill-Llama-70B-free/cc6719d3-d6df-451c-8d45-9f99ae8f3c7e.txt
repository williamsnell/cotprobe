Question:

In 2006, an investor purchased a 100-acre tract located in a rural county. Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan that created 90 one-acre residential building lots on this tract with the remaining 10-acre lot proposed for a public school building. In the investor's sales brochure promoting the subdivision, he stated that "in addition to the close proximity of the proposed school for subdivision residents, the county school district would not need to expend tax money to acquire this property for school construction. " In 2007, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. On January 15, 2009, the county school board voted to build a new school on the 10-acre tract. The investor's proposed designation of the 1 0-acre tract for construction of a school building would best be described as a (an)

Options:

A: equitable servitude.
B: easement for public use.
C: invalid legal agreement.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about real estate law, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

First, the scenario: An investor buys a 100-acre tract in a rural county in 2006. He then creates a subdivision plan with 90 one-acre lots and a 10-acre lot for a public school. He mentions in a sales brochure that the county school district won't have to spend tax money to acquire the property because it's already set aside. In 2007, the subdivision plan is recorded. Then, in 2009, the school board votes to build a school on that 10-acre tract.

The question is asking what the investor's designation of the 10-acre tract for the school would be called. The options are various legal terms related to real estate.

Hmm, so I need to match the scenario to the correct legal concept. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Equitable servitude. I remember that equitable servitudes are a type of restrictive covenant that are enforced in equity. They're usually created through a written agreement and bind future owners. They're often found in deeds or recorded documents.

Option B: Easement for public use. Easements are rights to use another's land. A public easement would typically be for a specific public purpose, like a road or utility. But here, the investor is designating land for a school, not granting a right to use his land.

Option C: Invalid legal agreement. I don't see any immediate reason why this would be invalid. The investor recorded the plan, so it might be a valid agreement.

Option D: Implied easement. Implied easements arise without a written agreement, often based on prior use. That doesn't seem to fit here because the investor is explicitly setting aside the land.

Option E: Adverse possession. That's when someone takes ownership of land without the owner's permission. Not relevant here.

Option F: Restrictive covenant. These are agreements that restrict the use of land. They can be enforceable if properly recorded and meet certain criteria. The investor's plan includes a restriction for a school, which could be a restrictive covenant.

Option G: Real estate lien. A lien is a claim on property for debt. Doesn't apply here since there's no mention of debt or loans.

Option H: Unenforceable restriction. I'm not sure if the restriction is enforceable. It depends on how it's set up. If it's properly recorded and part of the subdivision, it might be enforceable.

Option I: Right of way easement. This is a type of easement allowing someone to cross another's land. Not applicable here because the land is being set aside for a building, not for passage.

Option J: Zoning regulation. Zoning is a government-imposed regulation. Here, the investor is making the designation, not the government, so it's not zoning.

Wait, so the key here is that the investor is designating land for a school. When a developer sets aside land for public use as part of a subdivision, it's often done through a restrictive covenant or an easement. But in this case, the investor is dedicating the land specifically for a school, which the school board later accepts.

I think the correct term here is a restrictive covenant. Because the investor is imposing a restriction on how that 10-acre lot can be usedâ€”only for a school. By including this in the recorded subdivision plan, it's likely binding on future owners, which fits with a restrictive covenant.

But wait, could it also be an easement? An easement for public use would allow the public to use the land, but in this case, the land is being given for the school to build on, which is more of a dedication rather than an easement. An easement usually allows use without transferring ownership, whereas here, the ownership might be intended to transfer to the school district, or at least the right to use it exclusively for the school.

Alternatively, could this be a dedication? Like when a developer dedicates land for public use, it's often considered a public dedication. But the options don't include that term. So looking at the options, the closest would be a restrictive covenant.

Another angle: The investor's sales brochure mentions that the district wouldn't need to spend tax money to acquire the property. This suggests that the land is already set aside for them, which might imply that the investor has placed a covenant on the land, ensuring its use for the school.

So, between A and F. Equitable servitude and restrictive covenant. I think restrictive covenant is the more general term, and equitable servitude is a specific type that's enforced in equity. Since the subdivision plan is recorded, it's likely a restrictive covenant that's enforceable against future owners.

Therefore, the correct answer should be F: restrictive covenant.

The investor's designation of the 10-acre tract for a school would best be described as a restrictive covenant. A restrictive covenant is an agreement that imposes a specific restriction on the use of land, and it is typically enforceable if properly recorded and included in the subdivision plan. In this case, the investor explicitly set aside the 10-acre lot for a school and included this designation in the recorded subdivision plan, creating a binding restriction on the land's use. This aligns with the definition of a restrictive covenant, as it limits the property's use for the benefit of the subdivision and the public.
