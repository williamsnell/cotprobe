Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the cost of each order, and there are three parts: a, b, and c. Each part has a certain number of items and their respective prices. My goal is to calculate each total cost and then match it to the options provided. Let me take it step by step.

Starting with part (a): 346 glasses at 50 cents each. Hmm, 50 cents is like $0.50. So I need to multiply 346 by 0.50. Let me do that calculation. 346 * 0.5 is equal to 173. So that's $173.00. Wait, that makes sense because half of 346 is 173. So part (a) is $173.00.

Moving on to part (b): 870 nails at 3 and a half cents each. Oh wait, 3 and a half cents is 3.5 cents, which is $0.035. So I need to calculate 870 * 0.035. Let me think about how to compute this. Maybe breaking it down: 870 * 0.03 is 26.1, and 870 * 0.005 is 4.35. Adding them together, 26.1 + 4.35 equals 30.45. So part (b) is $30.45.

Now part (c): 125 chains at $16.48 each. So that's 125 multiplied by 16.48. Let me calculate that. 125 is the same as 100 + 25. So 100 * 16.48 is 1648, and 25 * 16.48 is... Wait, 25 times 16 is 400, and 25 times 0.48 is 12, so 400 +12=412. So total is 1648 + 412 = 2060. So part (c) is $2,060.00.

Now, looking back at the options. Each option lists the three amounts in the order a, b, c. So I need to find which option matches 173.00, 30.45, 2060.00.

Let me look through the options:

Option A: 150, 33.45, 2500 → No, a is wrong.

Option B: 173, 35, 2100 → a is correct, but b is higher than 30.45.

Option C: 150, 25.45, 2100 → a is wrong.

Option D: 173, 30.45, 2500 → a and b correct, but c is 2500 instead of 2060.

Option E: 200, 35, 2500 → a is wrong.

Option F: 150, 30.45, 2060 → a is wrong.

Option G: 180, 33.45, 1960 → a wrong.

Option H: 173, 30.45, 2060 → all three match! a is 173, b 30.45, c 2060.

Wait, let me double-check. Option H says 173, 30.45, 2060. Yes, that's exactly what I calculated. But let me look at the other options to be sure.

Option I: 180, 25.45, 2060 → a and b wrong.

Option J: 200, 30.45, 1960 → a wrong, c wrong.

So the correct option is H.

The correct answer is option H, which matches the calculated costs: $173.00 for part (a), $30.45 for part (b), and $2,060.00 for part (c).
