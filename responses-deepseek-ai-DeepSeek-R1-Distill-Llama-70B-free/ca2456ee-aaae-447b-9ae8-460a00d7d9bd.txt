Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. The question is asking which situation can be represented by the expression 6 x 2. The options are from A to I, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, first I should understand what 6 multiplied by 2 means. Multiplication is essentially repeated addition. So 6 x 2 is like adding 6 two times, which equals 12. But in real-life situations, it's about groups or sets. So I'm looking for a scenario where there are 6 items in each of 2 groups, leading to a total.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Rocco read six books in two months. Wait, that doesn't directly translate to multiplication. It sounds more like he read six books over two months, but not necessarily two sets of six. So maybe it's just a total of six, not 6 times 2.

Option B: Rocco hiked six miles each day for two days. Oh, this sounds promising. Each day he hikes 6 miles, and he does this for two days. So that's 6 miles/day * 2 days = 12 miles total. That fits 6 x 2.

Option C: Rocco spent six hours on homework for two days. Similar logic here. Each day he spends six hours, over two days. So 6 + 6 = 12 hours. That's 6 x 2 as well. So both B and C seem to fit so far.

Option D: Rocco has six siblings and two of them are girls. Wait, that's about the composition of siblings, not multiplication. It's more like out of six, two are girls. So this isn't a multiplication scenario.

Option E: Rocco had a total of six tennis balls in two cans. So it's saying six divided into two cans, perhaps three in each? Or maybe it's just the total, but the way it's phrased doesn't clearly show multiplication. It's more like 6 divided by 2, which would be 3 each, but the expression is 6 x 2, which is 12. So E doesn't fit.

Option F: Rocco had six shirts and washed two of them. That's about selecting a subset, not multiplication. So it's 6 shirts, and he washed two, so that's 2/6. Doesn't fit 6 x 2.

Option G: Rocco biked six miles and then continued for two more miles. So he went 6 + 2 = 8 miles. That's addition, not multiplication. So G is out.

Option H: Rocco had six baseballs and gave away two of them. Again, this is subtraction or a subset. He had six and gave two away, so it's 6 - 2 = 4 left. Not multiplication.

Option I: Rocco had six apples and ate two of them. Same as H, he's eating two out of six. So it's 6 - 2 = 4 apples left. Not multiplication.

Wait, so both B and C involve 6 occurring twice. So let me think again. The expression is 6 x 2, which is 12. So the situation should involve two groups of six each, making a total of 12.

Option B: He hiked 6 miles each day for two days. So total miles hiked would be 6 * 2 = 12. That fits.

Option C: He spent six hours on homework for two days. So each day six hours, two days. 6 * 2 = 12 hours total. That also fits.

Wait, so both B and C could be correct. But looking back at the options, the question says "could be represented by 6 x 2." So perhaps both are correct? But the options only allow one answer.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says which situation could be represented. So maybe both B and C are possible, but the options only allow one choice. Hmm, but looking back, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the way the options are phrased matters. Let me check again.

Option B: "Rocco hiked six miles each day for two days." So each day is a group of six miles, and there are two such groups. So total is 12. So yes, 6 x 2 = 12.

Option C: "Rocco spent six hours on homework for two days." Each day, he spends six hours. So again, 6 x 2 = 12 hours total.

So both B and C fit the expression. But looking back at the options, the correct answer should be one of them. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the options are A through I, and in the question, only one can be correct. Hmm. Maybe the intended answer is B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the way the question is phrased, only one option correctly uses multiplication.

Wait, let me think again. The key is that multiplication represents multiple groups. So in both cases, it's about multiple instances of the same number.

So perhaps both B and C are correct, but the options only list one of them as the correct choice. But looking back, the options are A to I, and each is a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps the answer expects only one correct option. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the original question lists the options as A to I, but in the problem statement, the options are labeled A to I, each with a different scenario. So, perhaps both B and C are correct, but only one of them is among the options. Wait, no, both B and C are in the options.

Wait, no, looking back: the options are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I. So both B and C are present. So that would imply that either could be correct. But the question asks which situation could be represented, so potentially more than one is correct, but the options likely have only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The expression is 6 x 2, which is 12. So the situation must involve 6 groups of 2, or 2 groups of 6. So both B and C have 2 groups of 6. So both B and C are correct.

Wait, but the options only allow one answer. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps only one of them is correct. Let me think about the wording.

Option B: "hiked six miles each day for two days." So each day is a group of six miles. So 6 x 2 = 12 miles in total.

Option C: "spent six hours on homework for two days." So each day is a group of six hours. So 6 x 2 = 12 hours in total.

So both are correct. But the answer options only have one correct choice, so perhaps only one of them is present in the options. Wait, in the given options, both B and C are present, so that would imply that either could be correct. But the options are mutually exclusive, so perhaps the intended answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think about the other options again.

Option E says Rocco had six tennis balls in two cans. That could mean 3 per can, but that's 6 divided by 2, which is 3, not 6 x 2. So E isn't correct.

So, in the end, both B and C seem correct, but since the options only allow one choice, perhaps the intended answer is B. Or maybe the question has a typo, but I think that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the answer is both B and C, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps the correct answer is B. Alternatively, the correct answer is both B and C, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the question expects just one. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the most appropriate one. Both are correct, but perhaps the answer is B.

Wait, no, perhaps the answer is E. Wait, no, E is about six tennis balls in two cans, which is 3 each, which is 6 divided by 2, not multiplication. So E is incorrect.

So, I think both B and C are correct, but since the options don't have both as correct, perhaps the intended answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and only one of them is correct. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the expression 6 x 2 represents two groups of six, so any situation where two groups each have six items. So, for example, B is two days each with six miles, so 6*2=12. C is two days each with six hours, so 6*2=12.

So both B and C are correct, but the options don't have both as correct. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is either B or C. But since the options are given, perhaps the correct answer is B.

Wait, but looking back, the options are A to I, and the correct answer is supposed to be one of them. So perhaps both B and C are correct, but the intended answer is B.

Wait, but in the initial question, the options are presented as A to I, so perhaps the correct answer is B and C, but since each is a separate option, perhaps only one is intended.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should just pick one.

So, I think the correct answer is B: Rocco hiked six miles each day for two days.

Wait, but then C also fits. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E: Rocco had a total of six tennis balls in two cans. But that's 6 in two cans, which would be 3 per can, so 6 = 3 x 2. So that's 3 groups of 2, but that's not 6 x 2. So E is not correct.

So, I think the correct answers are B and C, but since the question expects one, perhaps the intended answer is B.

The expression \(6 \times 2\) represents a situation where there are two groups of six items each, resulting in a total of 12. This can be applied to real-life scenarios involving multiplication.

- **Option A**: Rocco read six books in two months. This does not fit because it describes a total of six books over two months, not two groups of six.
- **Option B**: Rocco hiked six miles each day for two days. This fits because it involves two groups of six miles, totaling \(6 \times 2 = 12\) miles.
- **Option C**: Rocco spent six hours on homework for two days. This also fits because it involves two groups of six hours, totaling \(6 \times 2 = 12\) hours.
- **Option D**: Rocco has six siblings and two of them are girls. This does not fit because it describes a subset of six, not two groups of six.
- **Option E**: Rocco had a total of six tennis balls in two cans. This does not fit because it implies \(6 \div 2 = 3\) balls per can, not \(6 \times 2\).
- **Option F**: Rocco had six shirts and washed two of them. This does not fit because it describes a subset of six, not two groups of six.
- **Option G**: Rocco biked six miles and then continued for two more miles. This does not fit because it describes addition (\(6 + 2 = 8\)), not multiplication.
- **Option H**: Rocco had six baseballs and gave away two of them. This does not fit because it describes subtraction (\(6 - 2 = 4\)), not multiplication.
- **Option I**: Rocco had six apples and ate two of them. This does not fit because it describes subtraction (\(6 - 2 = 4\)), not multiplication.

Both **Option B** and **Option C** correctly represent \(6 \times 2\), as they involve two groups of six. However, since the question expects one answer, **Option B** is selected as the most appropriate choice.

Answer: B
