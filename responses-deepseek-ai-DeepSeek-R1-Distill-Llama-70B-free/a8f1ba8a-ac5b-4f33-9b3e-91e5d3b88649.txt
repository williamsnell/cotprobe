Okay, so I've got this question about meiosis and chromatids. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is about an animal with a diploid number of 8, so that means 2n equals 8. So the haploid number, n, would be 4. 

The question has three parts: a, b, and c. I'll tackle them one by one.

Part (a): During the tetrad stage, how many chromatids are present. The tetrad stage is part of prophase I in meiosis. I remember that during prophase I, the chromosomes condense, and each homologous pair forms a tetrad. Each chromosome has two sister chromatids because of replication in the S phase. So each tetrad has four chromatids. Wait, but wait—each tetrad is made of two chromosomes (each with two chromatids), so that's 2 chromosomes × 2 chromatids each = 4 chromatids per tetrad. But wait, the diploid number is 8, so how many tetrads are there? Oh wait, no, the tetrad stage refers to each pair. So for each homologous pair, there's a tetrad. So if diploid is 8, then 4 pairs. Each pair has 4 chromatids. So total chromatids would be 4 pairs × 4 chromatids each? Or wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Each tetrad is one pair, which has two chromosomes. Each of those has two chromatids. So each tetrad has 2 × 2 = 4 chromatids. So the question is asking about the tetrad stage, so the total number of chromatids in all tetrads. Since there are 4 pairs, each with 4, that's 4 × 4 = 16? Wait, but wait. Or is it that each tetrad has 4 chromatids, and the total is the sum? So 4 tetrads × 4 chromatids each = 16 chromatids. Hmm, but another thought: during the tetrad stage, the entire cell's chromosomes are in tetrads. So for a diploid of 8, there are 8 chromosomes in total, but during prophase I, each pair is a tetrad. Each of these 4 pairs has 4 chromatids. So the cell would have 4 tetrads × 4 chromatids each = 16 chromatids in total. So part (a) is 16? But wait, looking at the options, I need to check which option has (a) as 16. Let me look later.

Wait, no, another approach. During meiosis, each chromosome has two chromatids because they replicated in S phase. So the diploid cell has 8 chromosomes, each with 2 chromatids. So the total number of chromatids in the cell during tetrad stage is 8 × 2 = 16. Yes, that makes sense. So (a) is 16 chromatids. So looking for options where (a) is 16.

Looking at the options, let's see. Let's go through each option:

Option A: (a)4 → no, since I thought (a) is 16.
Option B: (a)8 → no.
Option C: (a)12 → no.
Option D: (a)8 → no.
Option E: (a)16 → yes, possible.
Option F: (a)4 → no.
Option G: (a)16 → yes.
Option H: (a)16 → yes.
Option I: (a)12 → no.
Option J: (a)4 → no.

So options E, G, H have (a) as 16.

Now part (b): late telophase of the first meiotic division. So what happens in telophase I. 

In meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes separate, so each daughter cell gets one from each pair. At the end of telophase I, the nuclear envelope reforms, and the chromosomes become less condensed. But wait, do the chromatids separate in meiosis I? No, because in meiosis I, it's the homologous pairs that separate, but each chromosome is still composed of two chromatids. So the sister chromatids are still attached. So each cell after meiosis I will have n=4 chromosomes, each with 2 chromatids. 

Wait, but during telophase I, the chromosomes are moving to the poles. So in late telophase I, each daughter cell has 4 chromosomes, each with 2 chromatids. So the number of chromatids per cell would be 4 × 2 =8.

Wait, but the question is asking for the number of chromatids in the cell during late telophase I. So each cell has 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So 4×2=8 chromatids per cell. So (b) is 8.

Wait, but wait—another thought. The first meiotic division produces two cells, each with 4 chromosomes. So each cell has 4 chromosomes, each with 2 chromatids, so 8 chromatids per cell. So part (b) is 8.

Looking back at the options, for (b), we need 8.

Looking at the options where (a) is 16:

Option E: (b)4 → no, not 8.
Option G: (b)8 → yes.
Option H: (b)8 → yes.

So now, options G and H are possible.

Now part (c): metaphase of the second meiotic division. So in meiosis II, each cell has n=4 chromosomes (haploid number). In metaphase II, the chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate. Each of these chromosomes is single (they are the result of the first division), but each still has two chromatids, because the sister chromatids haven't separated yet. Wait, no—no, in meiosis II, each chromosome is a single chromatid? No, wait. Let me think.

Wait, in meiosis I, after the division, each cell has 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. In meiosis II, each cell undergoes a division similar to mitosis. So during prophase II, the sister chromatids are still attached. So during metaphase II, each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids. So each cell in metaphase II has 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So total chromatids per cell is 4 × 2 =8.

Wait, but wait—am I mixing the counts? Let me think. The diploid is 8, so n=4. After meiosis I, each cell has 4 chromosomes, each with 2 chromatids (so 8 chromatids in each cell). Then in meiosis II, each cell divides into two. So during metaphase II, each cell has 4 chromosomes (same as before), each with 2 chromatids, so 8 chromatids in total.

Wait, but another angle: if the cell is in metaphase II, it's undergoing the second division. The number of chromosomes is the same as in the haploid state. So n=4, each with 2 chromatids. So 4×2=8 chromatids. So part (c) is 8.

Looking back at the options, for part (c) we need 8.

So among the options G and H:

Option G: (c) 8 → yes.
Option H: (c) 16 → no.

Wait, option G's (c) is 8, which matches.

So let's recap:

(a) 16 → part (a) is correct in G.
(b) 8 → correct.
(c) 8 → correct.

Looking at option G: (a)16, (b)8, (c)8. So that's option G.

Wait, but let's double-check.

Wait, meiosis I: the cell goes from diploid (8) to haploid (4), but each of the 4 has two chromatids. So during meiosis I telophase, each cell has 4 chromosomes with 2 chromatids each → 8 chromatids. So part (b) is 8.

Meiosis II, each cell from meiosis I has 4 chromosomes, each with two chromatids. So during metaphase II, each cell has 4×2 =8 chromatids.

So the correct numbers are (a)16, (b)8, (c)8. So option G.

Looking at the options, option G is (a)16, (b)8, (c)8.

So the correct answer should be option G.

To solve the question, we analyze each part based on the diploid number of 8 (2n=8), meaning the haploid number is 4 (n=4). The question asks about the number of chromatids during specific stages of meiosis.

### Part (a): Tetrad stage
During the tetrad stage in prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair up, forming tetrads. Each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids due to replication in the S phase. Since there are 4 homologous pairs (diploid number = 8), each pair contributes 4 chromatids (2 chromosomes × 2 chromatids each). Thus, the total number of chromatids in all tetrads is:

\[
4 \text{ pairs} \times 4 \text{ chromatids per pair} = 16 \text{ chromatids}.
\]

### Part (b): Late telophase of the first meiotic division
In telophase I, homologous chromosomes separate, and each daughter cell receives one chromosome from each pair. At this stage, each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids. Since the haploid number is 4, each daughter cell has:

\[
4 \text{ chromosomes} \times 2 \text{ chromatids per chromosome} = 8 \text{ chromatids}.
\]

### Part (c): Metaphase of the second meiotic division
In metaphase II, the chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate. Each chromosome still consists of two sister chromatids, as they have not yet separated. Since the haploid number is 4, the total number of chromatids in the cell is:

\[
4 \text{ chromosomes} \times 2 \text{ chromatids per chromosome} = 8 \text{ chromatids}.
\]

### Evaluating the Options
- **(a)** 16 chromatids: Options E, G, and H are valid.
- **(b)** 8 chromatids: Options G and H are valid.
- **(c)** 8 chromatids: Only option G is valid.

Thus, the correct answer is **G: (a) 16 chromatids, (b) 8 chromatids, (c) 8 chromatids**.
