Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 110 plus 70. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm not super confident with mental math, but I think I can break it down.

Alright, let's start by looking at the numbers. 110 is one hundred and ten, and 70 is seventy. So adding them together should give me... wait, maybe I can add the hundreds and the tens separately. The hundreds place in 110 is 1, and in 70 there's no hundreds, so that's 1 hundred. Then the tens place in 110 is 1 ten, which is 10, and in 70 it's 7 tens, which is 70. So adding those together: 10 plus 70 is 80. Then the ones place: 110 has 0 ones, and 70 also has 0, so that's 0. 

So putting it all together, 1 hundred plus 8 tens and 0 ones. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 hundred plus 8 tens would actually be 180, right? Because 100 plus 80 is 180. So 110 + 70 should be 180.

Let me double-check that because sometimes I get confused with the places. Another way is to just add them straight. 110 plus 70: 110 plus 70 is like adding 100 + 70 first, which is 170, and then adding the remaining 10, making it 180. Yeah, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, let me check each one. Option A is 18, which is way too small. B is 190, that's higher than what I got. C is 81, nope. D is 200, that's too high. E is 170, which is close but I think I added correctly to get 180. F is 810, that's way off. G is 210, no. H is 220, nope. I is 280, definitely not. J is 180, which matches what I calculated.

So I think the correct answer is J: 180.

The calculation for 110 + 70 is broken down by adding the hundreds, tens, and ones places separately. 

- Hundreds place: 100
- Tens place: 80 (from 70)
- Ones place: 0

Adding these together gives 180. Among the options provided, J corresponds to 180.

Answer: J
