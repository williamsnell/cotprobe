Question:

Two years ago, a developer conveyed title to a lot to a woman by warranty deed. The woman purchased an owner's policy of title insurance before the an owner's policy of title insurance before the closing. Because of an error by the title insurance company, the title commitment and title policy failed to list a county tax lien encumbering the lot as an exception to coverage. Last year, the woman conveyed the lot for a bargain price by a quitclaim deed to a friend, who paid cash, did not conduct a title search, and did not purchase title insurance. Subsequently, the county began proceedings to foreclose the tax lien, and the friend filed a claim with the woman's title insurance company, demanding that the company reimburse her for the tax lien amount. Is the title insurance company obligated to pay the friend's claim?

Options:

A: No, because the friend did not conduct a title search before purchasing the lot.
B: No, because the friend did not purchase her own title insurance.
C: No, because the title insurance policy expired when the woman conveyed the lot to the friend.
D: Yes, because the tax lien was not listed as an exception on the title insurance policy.
E: No, because the woman no longer owns the property, and thus her title insurance is no longer valid.
F: Yes, because the woman used a quitclaim deed, which means all encumbrances should transfer to the new owner.
G: No, because the friend is not a named insured on the title insurance policy.
H: Yes, because the friend paid cash, making her eligible for claims.
I: Yes, because the woman is liable to the friend for breach of the covenant against encumbrances, and the title policy should cover the friend's potential loss.
J: Yes, because the title insurance company made an error in not listing the tax lien.

Okay, so I've got this question about title insurance, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that a developer sold a lot to a woman two years ago using a warranty deed. She bought an owner's title insurance policy before closing. The title company made a mistake and didn't list a county tax lien as an exception. So, the policy didn't cover that lien.

Then, last year, the woman sold the lot to her friend using a quitclaim deed for a bargain price. The friend paid cash, didn't do a title search, and didn't get her own title insurance. Now, the county is foreclosure proceedings on the tax lien, and the friend is claiming against the woman's title insurance company to reimburse her for the lien amount. The question is whether the insurance company has to pay.

I remember that title insurance policies typically cover the owner against defects or encumbrances that were present at the time the policy was issued. The policy usually has exceptions, which are things not covered. Here, the tax lien wasn't excepted, so it should be covered under the policy.

Wait, but the woman sold the property to her friend. Does the title insurance stay with the property or with the original owner? I think that owner's policies are for the owner's benefit. So when the woman conveyed the lot, she might no longer be the owner, so her policy might not cover the friend. But some policies have a provision that allows the coverage to pass to subsequent owners, but I'm not sure about that.

Looking at the options, option D says yes because the tax lien wasn't excepted. Option G says no because the friend isn't named insured. Option I says yes because the woman is liable and the policy covers the friend's loss.

Wait, the woman's policy likely covers her up to the time she owned the property. When she sold it via quitclaim, the friend took the property as is. But the tax lien was a problem when the woman owned it, so the title company's mistake would affect the woman's ownership. But since she's no longer the owner, does the insurance still apply?

Wait, no. The title insurance policy generally protects the insured (the woman) against losses during her ownership. Once she sells, unless there's a provision that extends coverage to future owners, the friend wouldn't be covered under the woman's policy. So the friend isn't the insured, so the company isn't obligated to pay her claim.

Looking at the options again, option G says no because she's not a named insured. That makes sense because the policy was issued to the woman. The friend didn't buy her own policy.

So the answer should be G. But wait, another thought: sometimes, when you sell property, the title insurance might have a clause that allows it to continue for the new owner, but I think that's more common in extended coverage or specific endorsements, not standard. Also, the friend didn't have any policy, so she's not covered.

So the correct answer is G: No, because the friend is not a named insured on the title insurance policy.

The title insurance policy was issued to the woman when she purchased the property, and it protected her against defects or encumbrances present at the time of issuance. However, title insurance policies typically cover only the named insured, which in this case was the woman. When the woman conveyed the property to her friend via a quitclaim deed, she was no longer the owner, and the policy did not automatically extend coverage to the friend. The friend, not being a named insured on the policy, cannot make a claim under it. Therefore, the title insurance company is not obligated to pay the friend's claim.

G: No, because the friend is not a named insured on the title insurance policy.

Answer: G
