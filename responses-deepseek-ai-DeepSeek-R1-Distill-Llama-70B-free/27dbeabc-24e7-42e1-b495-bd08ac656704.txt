Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about inventory valuation methods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So the company is called Magic-Voice Radio Supply, and they're dealing with their #84A tubes. They're taking inventory at the end of the year, and I need to calculate the value using three methods: Average Cost, FIFO, and LIFO. The question gives the quantities and costs from various purchases, and the ending inventory quantity.

Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, I'll list out all the data provided. The initial inventory on January 1 is 800 tubes at $0.252 each. Then, there are four purchases throughout the year: March 3rd (2000 tubes at $0.247), June 5th (1500 at $0.262), October 13th (900 at $0.27), and November 25th (600 at $0.272). The total quantity on hand at the end is 1700 tubes.

Wait, so I think I need to calculate the total number of tubes available for sale and see how much was sold. Hmm, but wait, the problem is about the value of the remaining inventory, so maybe I should calculate how many tubes were sold and then apply the costing methods to the remaining.

Wait, no. The ending inventory is 1700, so we need to see how many were purchased and how many are left. Let me calculate the total tubes available:

Initial inventory: 800

Plus purchases:

March: 2000 → total so far 2800

June: +1500 → 4300

October: +900 → 5200

November: +600 → 5800.

So total tubes available during the year are 5800.

But ending inventory is 1700, which means the number sold is 5800 - 1700 = 4100 tubes.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the company started with 800, then bought more. So total available is 800 + 2000 + 1500 + 900 + 600 = 5800. Ending inventory is 1700, so they must have sold 5800 - 1700 = 4100 tubes. So the cost of goods sold would be based on these 4100, but the question is about the ending inventory value, which is 1700 tubes.

So for each method, I need to calculate the value of these 1700 tubes.

Let me tackle each method one by one.

Starting with (a) Average Cost.

Average cost would take the total cost of all tubes available for sale, divide by total quantity, then multiply by the ending inventory quantity.

So first, calculate total cost:

Initial inventory: 800 * 0.252 = let's see, 800 * 0.25 is 200, so 0.252 is 200 + (800 * 0.002) = 200 + 1.6 = 201.6.

March purchase: 2000 * 0.247 → 2000 * 0.2 is 400, 2000 * 0.04 is 80, 2000 * 0.007 is 14. So 400 +80=480 +14=494. So 2000 *0.247 = $494.

June: 1500 * 0.262 → Let's compute 1500 *0.2=300, 1500*0.06=90, 1500*0.002=3. So 300+90=390 +3=393. So $393.

October:900 *0.27 → 900 *0.2=180, 900*.07=63 → total 243.

November:600 *0.272 → 600 *0.2=120, 600 *0.07=42, 600 *0.002=1.2 → 120+42=162 +1.2=163.2.

Now sum all these costs:

Initial: 201.6

March:494 → 201.6 +494 = 695.6

June: 393 → 695.6 +393=1088.6

October:243 → 1088.6 +243=1331.6

November:163.2 → 1331.6 +163.2=1494.8.

So total cost is $1,494.8 (Wait, wait: 201.6 +494 is 695.6, plus 393 is 1088.6, plus 243 is 1331.6, plus 163.2 is 1,494.8? Wait, no, 1331.6 + 163.2 is 1,494.8? Let me check: 1331.6 + 163.2 = 1494.8. Yes, correct.

Total quantity available is 800 +2000+1500+900+600=5800 tubes.

Average cost per tube is total cost / quantity = 1494.8 /5800.

Let me compute that. 1494.8 divided by 5800. Hmm.

Let me do this: 1494.8 /5800 = ?

Well, 5800 = 5.8e3. 1494.8 /5800 = (1494.8 / 58) /100.

Compute 1494.8 /58:

58 ×25 = 1450. 58×25=1450. 1494.8-1450=44.8 left.

44.8 /58 = approximately 0.7724 (since 58 ×0.7=40.6, 44.8-40.6=4.2 → 4.2/58≈0.0724). So total is 25.7724.

So 25.7724 /100 → 0.257724 per tube.

So average cost per tube is approximately $0.257724.

Now, ending inventory is 1700 tubes. So total value is 1700 * 0.257724.

Compute 1700 *0.25 =425.

1700 *0.007724 = ?

0.007724 *1700 = let's compute step by step.

0.007 *1700 =11.9

0.000724 *1700 = approx 1.2308.

So total 11.9 +1.2308 =13.1308.

So 425 +13.1308 =438.1308.

So approximately $438.13.

Looking at the options, I think option B is (a) $439.60, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should calculate more accurately.

Let me compute 1494.8 ÷5800.

Compute 1494.8 ÷5800:

5800 goes into 14948 how many times?

5800 ×2 =11600 → 11600. Subtract from 14948: 14948-11600=3348.

Bring down a zero → 33480.

5800 ×5=29000 → 33480-29000=4480.

Bring down 0 →44800.

5800 ×7=40600 →44800-40600=4200.

Bring down 0→42000.

5800 ×7=40600 → again 40600 → 42000-40600=1400.

So so far, 2.5757 (approximately), but wait, I'm getting 1494.8 /5800 = 0.2577... So 0.2577 per unit.

Then 1700 × 0.2577 = ?

1700 ×0.2 =340

1700 ×0.05=85 → 340+85=425.

1700 ×0.0077= approx 13.09.

So total 425+13.09=438.09.

Hmm, so about 438.09. So option B has (a) 439.60, which is higher. So perhaps I made an error in the total cost.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the total cost. Let me recalculate each cost.

Initial inventory:800 *0.252 = 800*0.25=200, 800*0.002=1.6 → total 201.6. Correct.

March:2000 *0.247 → let's compute 2000*.2=400, 2000*.04=80, 2000*.007=14 → 400+80+14=494. Correct.

June:1500 *0.262 → 1500*.2=300, 1500*.06=90, 1500*.002=3 → 393. Correct.

October:900 *0.27 → 900*.2=180, 900*.07=63 → 243. Correct.

November:600 *0.272 → let's compute 600*.2=120, 600*.07=42, 600*.002=1.2 → total 163.2. Correct.

So total cost is indeed 201.6+494+393+243+163.2 = 

Let me add them:

201.6 +494 = 695.6

695.6 +393 = 1088.6

1088.6 +243 =1331.6

1331.6 +163.2=1494.8. So correct.

So 1494.8 /5800 =0.257724 approximately.

So 1700 *0.257724 = ?

Wait, to compute this accurately, maybe I should do it step by step.

0.257724 per unit.

1700 * 0.25 =425.

1700 *0.007724= ?

Compute 0.007724 *1700:

0.007 *1700=11.9

0.000724 *1700=1.2308

So 11.9 +1.2308=13.1308.

So total is 425 +13.1308=438.1308.

So about $438.13.

Looking at the options, which one has (a) as approximately 438.13?

Looking at the options:

Option B: (a) 439.60 → higher.

Option H: (a) 437.60, (b)457.60, (c)422.90.

Option E: (a)435.80.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the average cost calculation.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the average cost is (total cost) / total quantity.

Wait, but 1494.8 /5800 = 0.257724 dollars per tube.

So 1700 *0.257724 = 438.13. So perhaps option H is (a) 437.60.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1494.8 /5800 more accurately.

Let me compute 1494.8 ÷5800:

5800 goes into 14948 2 times (2×5800=11600). Subtract 11600 from 14948 → 3348.

Bring down a zero → 33480.

5800 ×5=29000 → subtract → 4480.

Bring down zero →44800.

5800×7=40600 → subtract →4200.

Bring down zero →42000.

5800×7=40600 → subtract →1400.

Bring down zero →14000.

5800×2=11600 → subtract →2400.

So the division is 0.257... Let me write it as 0.257724 approximately.

So 0.257724 ×1700 = 438.13.

So the average cost is approximately $438.13.

Looking at the options, maybe the closest is option B: (a) 439.60, but that's higher. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute the average cost differently. Let me try another approach.

Total cost is $1494.8.

Total quantity is 5800.

So per unit cost is 1494.8 /5800.

Let me compute this using calculator-like steps.

5800 × 0.2577 → let's see: 5800 ×0.2=1160, 5800 ×0.05=290, 5800 ×0.007=40.6, 5800×0.0007=4.06.

Adding 1160+290=1450, +40.6=1490.6, +4.06=1494.66. So 5800 ×0.2577=1494.66, which is close to 1494.8. So 0.2577 per unit.

Thus, 1700 ×0.2577 = ?

1700 ×0.2=340.

1700 ×0.05=85 → 340+85=425.

1700 ×0.0077=13.09.

So total 425+13.09=438.09.

So approximately $438.09.

Looking at the options, the closest I see is option B: (a) 439.60, which is a bit higher. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial total cost calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the initial cost again. Let me add the costs again.

Initial:800×0.252=201.6.

March:2000×0.247=494.

June:1500×0.262=393.

October:900×0.27=243.

November:600×0.272=163.2.

Adding all: 201.6 +494 is 695.6, plus 393 is 1088.6, plus 243 is 1331.6, plus 163.2 is 1494.8. Correct.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the average to be calculated differently, like including the initial inventory in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the average cost is computed as the total cost divided by total units, but I'm confident I did that correctly.

Moving on, perhaps I'll check the other methods to see if any of the options match.

Next, (b) FIFO.

FIFO assumes that the earliest purchased tubes are sold first. So the ending inventory would consist of the most recent purchases.

So to calculate FIFO, I need to see which tubes remain in inventory.

Total tubes sold:4100.

The order of purchases is:

Jan 1:800

March 3:2000

June5:1500

Oct13:900

Nov25:600

So the sales would be taken from the earliest lots first.

So the first 800 are sold, then March's 2000, then June's 1500, etc., until 4100 are sold.

Let me track how many are taken from each lot.

Total sold:4100.

Start with Jan 1:800. So take all 800 → sold:800. Remaining to sell:4100-800=3300.

Next, March 3:2000. Take all 2000 → sold:800+2000=2800. Remaining:4100-2800=1300.

Next, June 5:1500. Take 1300 from here → sold 2800+1300=4100.

So the remaining inventory would be June 5 lot's remaining:1500-1300=200, and then the October 13 and November 25 lots are untouched.

Wait, no. Because after March, we sold 2800, then took 1300 from June. So the ending inventory would be the remaining from June (1500-1300=200), plus all of October (900) and November (600). So total is 200+900+600=1700, which matches.

So the FIFO cost would be:

200 tubes from June at $0.262.

900 tubes from October at $0.27.

600 tubes from November at $0.272.

So compute each:

200 ×0.262 =52.4.

900 ×0.27=243.

600 ×0.272=163.2.

Total FIFO value:52.4 +243=295.4 +163.2=458.6.

So $458.6.

Looking at the options, option B's FIFO is 459.60, which is higher. Hmm, maybe I missed something.

Wait, wait. Let me check the calculations again.

June's cost: 200 ×0.262 → 200 ×0.2=40, 200 ×0.06=12, 200×0.002=0.4 → total 40+12=52 +0.4=52.4.

October:900 ×0.27=243.

November:600 ×0.272=163.2.

Total 52.4+243=295.4 +163.2=458.6.

So approximately $458.60.

Looking at the options, option B has (b) $459.60, which is close but a bit higher. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of units taken from each lot.

Wait, let me double-check the number of units sold from each lot.

Total tubes available:5800.

Ending inventory:1700, so sold 4100.

Jan:800 sold → 800.

March:2000 sold → total 2800.

June:1500 available, we need to sell 1300 more → so 1300 sold from June's 1500, leaving 200.

So yes, that's correct.

So FIFO value is 200×0.262 +900×0.27 +600×0.272 =458.6.

Now, looking at the options, the closest is option B, which has (b) 459.60. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute each part again.

200 ×0.262:

0.262 ×200 → 0.2 ×200=40, 0.06×200=12, 0.002×200=0.4 → total 52.4.

900 ×0.27 → 900 ×0.27: 900 ×0.2=180, 900×0.07=63 → 180+63=243.

600 ×0.272 → 600 ×0.2=120, 600×0.07=42, 600×0.002=1.2 → 120+42=162 +1.2=163.2.

So 52.4 +243=295.4 +163.2=458.6.

So $458.60.

Looking at the options, none of the (b) options exactly match. Let's look at the options again.

Option B: (a)439.60, (b)459.60, (c)424.90.

Option G: (a)438, (b)458, (c)423.

Wait, none of the options show (b) as 458.60. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the method.

Wait, perhaps in FIFO, the ending inventory is considered to be the latest purchases, but perhaps I should have taken more from later lots.

Wait, no. FIFO uses the earliest units
