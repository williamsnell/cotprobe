Question:

Sometimes, when the percentages in a discount series are familiar fractions, such as 33(1/2)% = (1/3) , 12(1/2)% = (1/8) or 6(1/4)% = (1/16) you can solve the problem more easily if you change the order of the discounting. What is the net amount you get from (a) $63.60 less 16(2/3)% and 10% (b) $126.00 less 2% and 66(2/3)%?

Options:

A: $54.24, $44.52
B: $50.88, $37.80
C: $47.70, $41.16
D: $53.00, $42.00
E: $5.30, $0.84
F: $48.96, $38.88
G: $42.84, $39.06
H: $45.30, $43.20
I: $60.00, $40.00
J: $10.60, $84.00

Okay, so I have this problem about discounts and finding the net amount after applying two successive discounts. The question has two parts, (a) and (b), each with a different starting amount and two discount percentages. The hint says that sometimes when the percentages are familiar fractions, changing the order can make it easier. Hmm, I've heard that because when you have discounts like 33 1/2%, which is 1/3, or 12 1/2% which is 1/8, applying them in a different order might lead to the same result, but maybe it's easier to compute one way.

Let me tackle part (a) first. The problem is $63.60 with discounts of 16 2/3% and 10%. So I need to find the net amount after applying both discounts in some order. Wait, but the hint suggests that sometimes changing the order can help, but do I need to change the order, or just apply them in the given order? I think the discounts are applied successively, so the order matters because each discount is applied on the previous amount.

Wait, but maybe some discounts can be applied in any order because they are fractions that multiply in a way that's commutative. For instance, 16 2/3% is 1/6, because 16.666...% is 1/6. So 16 2/3% as a decimal is approximately 0.166666..., which is 1/6. So a 16 2/3% discount is taking away 1/6 of the price, leaving 5/6. Then 10% is 0.10, so the remaining is 90%, or 0.9.

So, if I apply 16 2/3% first, then 10%, the calculation would be 63.60 * (5/6) * 0.9. Alternatively, if I apply 10% first, then 16 2/3%, it would be 63.60 * 0.9 * (5/6). But multiplication is commutative, so the order doesn't change the result. So perhaps changing the order doesn't affect the final amount, but the hint suggests that sometimes it can make the problem easier. Maybe because some fractions are easier to compute in a certain way.

Wait, but maybe I should compute both ways to make sure. Let's compute both ways.

First, applying 16 2/3% first. So 16 2/3% is 1/6, so 5/6 remains. 63.60 * 5/6. Let me compute that. 63.60 divided by 6 is 10.6, multiplied by 5 is 53. So after the first discount, it's 53. Then apply 10% discount. 10% of 53 is 5.3, so 53 -5.3 is 47.7.

Alternatively, applying 10% first. 63.60 * 0.9 is 57.24. Then applying 16 2/3% discount, which is 5/6 of 57.24. 57.24 divided by 6 is 9.54, times 5 is 47.7. Same result. So the order doesn't change the outcome here because multiplication is commutative.

So part (a) gives $47.70.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see. The options are pairs, so for (a) and (b). Let me check the options. Option C is (a) 47.70 and (b) 41.16. Hmm, but wait, I haven't done part (b) yet.

Now part (b): $126.00 less 2% and 66 2/3%. So I need to apply both discounts. Let me see what 66 2/3% is as a fraction. 66 2/3% is 2/3, because 66.666...% is 2/3. So a discount of 66 2/3% would leave 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. So the remaining is 1/3.

Wait, but the discounts are 2% and 66 2/3%. So maybe I can compute the two discounts in any order, but let's see what's easier. Let me try both ways.

First way: apply 2% first. 2% of 126 is 2.52, so subtracting gives 123.48. Then apply 66 2/3%, which is 2/3. So the remaining is 1/3. 123.48 * (1/3) is 41.16.

Alternatively, apply 66 2/3% first. 126 * (1/3) is 42. Then apply 2% discount on 42, which is 0.02 *42=0.84. So 42 -0.84 is 41.16. So same result.

So part (b) gives $41.16.

Looking back at the options, option C is (a) $47.70 and (b) $41.16. So option C. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: $54.24, $44.52

B: $50.88, $37.80

C: $47.70, $41.16

D: $53.00, $42.00

E: $5.30, $0.84

F: $48.96, $38.88

G: $42.84, $39.06

H: $45.30, $43.20

I: $60.00, $40.00

J: $10.60, $84.00

So the correct answer for part (a) is 47.70, part (b) 41.16, which is option C.

The problem involves calculating the net amount after applying two successive discounts in each of two scenarios. The discounts are given as percentages, and the hint suggests that recognizing these percentages as familiar fractions can simplify the calculations. The key steps are as follows:

### Part (a): $63.60 less 16(2/3)% and 10%
1. **Convert percentages to fractions**:
   - 16(2/3)% = 1/6, so the remaining fraction is 5/6.
   - 10% = 1/10, so the remaining fraction is 9/10 (or 0.9).
2. **Apply the discounts**:
   - First, apply 16(2/3)%:  
     \( 63.60 \times \frac{5}{6} = 53.00 \).
   - Then, apply 10%:  
     \( 53.00 \times 0.9 = 47.70 \).
   - Alternatively, applying the discounts in reverse order yields the same result due to the commutative property of multiplication.

Thus, the net amount for part (a) is **$47.70**.

---

### Part (b): $126.00 less 2% and 66(2/3)%
1. **Convert percentages to fractions**:
   - 2% = 0.02, so the remaining fraction is 0.98.
   - 66(2/3)% = 2/3, so the remaining fraction is 1/3.
2. **Apply the discounts**:
   - First, apply 2%:  
     \( 126.00 \times 0.98 = 123.48 \).
   - Then, apply 66(2/3)%:  
     \( 123.48 \times \frac{1}{3} = 41.16 \).
   - Alternatively, applying the discounts in reverse order yields the same result due to the commutative property of multiplication.

Thus, the net amount for part (b) is **$41.16**.

---

### Final Answer:
The net amounts for parts (a) and (b) are **$47.70** and **$41.16**, respectively. Comparing these results to the provided options, the correct choice is:

**C: $47.70, $41.16**
