Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the "reasonable person" standard in tort law. Hmm, I remember that the reasonable person is a legal fiction used to determine if someone acted with ordinary care. Let me think through each option carefully.

Option A says the standard applies only to people with high education. Wait, no, the reasonable person is about ordinary care, not tied to education level. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says it applies only to people without disabilities. That doesn't sound right either. I think the standard might adjust for certain disabilities. For example, a blind person wouldn't be expected to see something, but maybe their actions are judged based on a reasonable blind person. So B might be incorrect.

Option C claims the standard varies from person to person. No, I think it's more of an objective standard, not subjective. It's about what a typical reasonable person would do, not varying individually. So C is probably wrong.

Option D says it requires acting as the average person in the community. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think the reasonable person is an objective standard, but does it refer to the average person? Or is it more about what's considered reasonable regardless of the average? Maybe D is incorrect.

Option E suggests a mentally disabled person must act like others with the same disability. Wait, I think the law might hold them to the standard of a reasonable person with their condition. So E could be correct, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, does it use the reasonable person without considering the disability? Or adjust for it?

Option F states a physically disabled person must act as a reasonable person with the same disability. That sounds right. Like, a person in a wheelchair would be judged against what a reasonable person in a wheelchair would do. So F might be correct.

Option G says the standard focuses on the defendant's subjective mental state. No, the reasonable person is about objective behavior, not subjective intent. So G is wrong.

Option H claims it's based solely on age. No, age can be a factor, but the standard isn't solely based on it. So H is incorrect.

Option I says a mentally disabled person isn't subject to the standard. I don't think that's right. They are subject to it, but the standard is adjusted to their condition. So I is probably wrong.

Now, going back. The key is understanding how the reasonable person standard applies to people with disabilities. I remember that for physical disabilities, the standard is adjusted. So a blind person is held to the standard of a reasonable blind person. But for mental disabilities, like cognitive impairments, it's sometimes handled differently. Wait, but the question is about the correct statement.

Looking at the options again, F says a physically disabled person must act as a reasonable person with the same disability. That aligns with what I remember. So F is correct.

Wait, what about E? E says a mentally disabled person must act as a person with the same mental disability. I'm not as sure about that. I think for mental disabilities, sometimes the standard isn't adjusted because it's about the person's actual capacity. Or maybe it's more complicated. I'm a bit torn, but I think F is the correct answer because it's a clear application of the adjusted standard for physical disabilities.

The "reasonable person" standard in tort law is an objective measure used to determine whether a defendant's actions were reasonable under the circumstances. It is not based on subjective mental states, education level, or solely on age. The standard adjusts for certain disabilities, particularly physical ones, where the defendant is held to the standard of a reasonable person with the same disability. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The standard applies broadly, not just to highly educated individuals.
- **B**: Incorrect. It applies to everyone, including those with disabilities, though adjustments may be made.
- **C**: Incorrect. The standard is objective and does not vary from person to person.
- **D**: Incorrect. It is not about the "average" person but what a reasonable person would do.
- **E**: Potentially correct but less clear. The law may adjust the standard for mental disabilities, but this is not as straightforward as for physical disabilities.
- **F**: Correct. A physically disabled person is held to the standard of a reasonable person with the same disability.
- **G**: Incorrect. The standard focuses on objective behavior, not subjective mental states.
- **H**: Incorrect. Age is a factor but not the sole basis of the standard.
- **I**: Incorrect. Mentally disabled individuals are subject to the standard, though adjustments may apply.

The most accurate and clear answer is **F**, as it correctly reflects the application of the reasonable person standard to individuals with physical disabilities.
