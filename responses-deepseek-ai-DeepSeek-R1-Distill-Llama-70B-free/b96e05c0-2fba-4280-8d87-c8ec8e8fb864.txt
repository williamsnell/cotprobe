Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Savigny's Volksgeist and which statement is least likely to follow from it. Hmm, I remember that Savigny was a 19th-century German legal scholar, part of the Historical School of jurisprudence. His idea of Volksgeist refers to the "spirit of the people," suggesting that law grows organically from a nation's culture, history, and collective consciousness. So, the law isn't just made by some authority; it's deeply rooted in the people's traditions and values.

The question asks which statement is least likely to follow from this notion. Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: "Law is the deliberate expression of a sovereign's will." Wait, Savigny's view is that law isn't imposed by a ruler but arises from the people. So this statement seems more like the positivist view, where law comes from a sovereign. That might be the opposite of Volksgeist, so this could be the least likely.

Option B: "Law is an integral element of the social fabric." Yeah, that makes sense because if law comes from the people's spirit, it's definitely part of the social structure. So this would follow from Savigny's idea.

Option C: "Law is the direct outcome of a society's economic structure." Hmm, I'm not sure. Volksgeist is more about culture and history. Economic structure is more of a Marxist view, like base and superstructure. So maybe this isn't directly related, but I'm not certain if it's the least likely. I'll have to think more.

Option D: "Law is like language." Oh, right! Savigny compared law to language because both develop organically and are part of a people's identity. So this definitely follows, making it not the answer.

Option E: "A society's law is a reflection of its culture." That's exactly what Volksgeist is about. So this is a direct consequence and not the least likely.

Option F: "Law is merely a tool for oppression by the ruling class." This seems like a Marxist or critical legal studies perspective, suggesting law is used to oppress. Savigny's view is more about law being an organic part of the people, not a tool of oppression. So this is unlikely to follow from his ideas.

Now, I need to determine which is least likely. Let's compare A and F. Savigny's Volksgeist opposes the idea that law is imposed by a sovereign (A) and also doesn't see law as a tool for oppression (F). But which is less likely?

Savigny's argument was against the idea that law is created by a sovereign's will, so A directly contradicts his view. F, on the other hand, is a different perspective but maybe not as directly opposed because Volksgeist doesn't necessarily address whether law is oppressive or not. It just says it comes from the people, but the people could be diverse. Wait, but if law reflects the Volksgeist, it's the collective spirit, so it's not just the ruling class's tool. So F would also be unlikely.

But the question is about which is least likely. Between A and F, I think A is more directly opposed because it's about the source of law. Savigny's whole point was against positivism, which is what A states. So A is the least likely.

Wait, but option C says law is a direct outcome of economic structure. That's more about materialism. Savigny's approach is more idealist, focusing on culture and spirit. So C is also unlikely. But comparing A, C, and F.

Savigny's Volksgeist is about law being part of the culture, history, and collective mind. So option C, which ties law directly to economics, doesn't align. But I think A is even more directly opposed because it's about the deliberate expression of a sovereign, which is the opposite of organic growth from the people.

So the least likely would be either A or F. But since F is about oppression, which isn't directly addressed by Savigny but more by others, A is more directly contradictory.

Savigny's concept of Volksgeist posits that law organically arises from a nation's culture, history, and collective consciousness, emphasizing that it is not imposed by a sovereign but reflects the "spirit of the people." With this in mind, the question asks which statement is least likely to follow from this notion. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: "Law is the deliberate expression of a sovereign's will." This directly contradicts Savigny's view, as Volksgeist argues that law grows organically from the people, not from a sovereign's will. This makes it a strong candidate for the least likely statement.

- **Option B**: "Law is an integral element of the social fabric." This aligns with Savigny's idea, as law is seen as deeply embedded in the culture and traditions of a society.

- **Option C**: "Law is the direct outcome of a society's economic structure." While this reflects a Marxist perspective, it is less directly opposed to Savigny's Volksgeist, which focuses on culture and history rather than economics.

- **Option D**: "Law is like language." Savigny explicitly compared law to language, as both develop organically and reflect a people's identity, making this statement consistent with his ideas.

- **Option E**: "A society's law is a reflection of its culture." This is a direct expression of Volksgeist, as law is seen as a reflection of the collective spirit and culture of a people.

- **Option F**: "Law is merely a tool for oppression by the ruling class." While this is unlikely to follow from Savigny's ideas, it is less directly contradictory than Option A, as Volksgeist does not explicitly address oppression but rather focuses on the organic origins of law.

Between the options, **Option A** is the least likely to follow from Savigny's Volksgeist, as it directly opposes the idea that law arises from the people rather than being imposed by a sovereign.
