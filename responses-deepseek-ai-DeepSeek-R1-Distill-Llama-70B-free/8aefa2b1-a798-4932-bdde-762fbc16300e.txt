Okay, so I have this question about Japanese history, specifically about when Japan closed itself off to Christianity and Europe. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that this period is often referred to as sakoku, which was a time when Japan isolated itself from the outside world. I think it started in the 17th century. The main reasons were political and religious. The Tokugawa shogunate was in power then, right? They were concerned about European influence, especially Christianity, which they saw as a threat to their authority.

Wait, when did this actually happen? I recall that the Portuguese arrived in Japan in the mid-16th century, bringing Christianity with them. The Jesuits started converting people, but the Japanese rulers weren't too happy about that. So, the shogunate began to crack down on Christians and eventually expelled the Europeans.

I think the key event was the issuance of the "Closed Country Edict" around 1633-1639. Oh, but there were earlier steps too. Like in 1587, Toyotomi Hideyoshi issued an edict banning missionaries, but that wasn't the full closure. The actual closure came a bit later when the Tokugawa took over.

So the sakoku period is usually said to have started around 1633 and lasted until the mid-19th century when Commodore Perry arrived. But looking at the options, I need to find the right range.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 1587-1639. Well, 1587 is when Hideyoshi's edict was issued, but the full closure happened later. So this might be too early.

Option G: 1641-1853. That seems a bit too late. Because the main closure started in the 1630s. 1641 is when the Dutch were moved to Dejima, but the initial edict was earlier.

Option F: 1614-1859. Hmm, 1614 is when the Tokugawa banned Christianity more strictly. But the full sakoku started a bit later.

Option B: 1603-1868. That's the Edo period, which is when the Tokugawa ruled. But sakoku was a part of this period. The closure started in the 1630s, so maybe the dates in the options don't exactly match.

Wait, the actual period of sakoku is considered to be from about 1633 to 1853. But looking at the options, none exactly match that. Let me check the options again.

Option C is 1587-1639. That's from Hideyoshi's edict to when the Portuguese were expelled. Maybe that's considered the initial phase, but the full closure was from 1633 onwards. So perhaps the correct answer is Option C, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, Option G is 1641-1853. 1641 is when the Dutch were confined to Dejima, which was part of the sakoku policies. So maybe the sakoku is considered to have started around then.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The major events were:

- 1587: Hideyoshi bans missionaries.
- 1614: Tokugawa Ieyasu issues an edict expelling foreigners and banning Christianity.
- 1633: The Tokugawa shogunate issues the Closed Country Edict, starting sakoku.
- 1639: The Portuguese are expelled, and the last Christians are executed.
- 1853: Perry arrives, leading to the end of sakoku.

So the period of closure was from the early 1630s to the 1850s. Looking at the options, the closest would be Option C (1587-1639) or G (1641-1853). But Option C ends in 1639, which is about when the main events happened, but the closure had already been in effect for a few years before that.

Alternatively, Option G starts in 1641, which is a bit after the main closure. So perhaps the correct option is C, as it covers the initial edicts and the expulsion. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another thought: the period of sakoku is often said to have lasted from 1633 to 1853. So the start would be around 1633 and end in 1853. Looking at the options, none of them exactly match that. But looking at the options, Option G is 1641-1853. That starts a bit later than the actual start but ends correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the time when Christianity was banned and the country was closed, which might include the earlier edicts. So Option C covers from Hideyoshi's edict to the expulsion.

I'm a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is C: 1587-1639. Because that's when the major steps towards closure happened, even though the full sakoku was a bit later.

The question asks for the timespan of Japan's closure to Christianity and Europe, commonly known as the sakoku period. This era of isolation was initiated by the Tokugawa shogunate in response to the spread of Christianity and the perceived threat of European influence. Key events include:

- **1587**: Toyotomi Hideyoshi issued an edict banning Christian missionaries.
- **1614**: Tokugawa Ieyasu expelled foreigners and banned Christianity.
- **1633**: The "Closed Country Edict" was issued, formally beginning sakoku.
- **1639**: The Portuguese were expelled, and the last Christians were executed.
- **1853**: Commodore Matthew Perry's arrival led to the end of sakoku.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C (1587-1639)**: This range starts with Hideyoshi's edict and ends with the expulsion of the Portuguese, covering the initial and critical phases of closure.
- **Option G (1641-1853)**: This range begins after the main closure had already started and ends correctly with Perry's arrival.

While the sakoku period is often considered to have started in 1633, the broader context of closure began earlier with Hideyoshi's edicts. Therefore, **Option C (1587-1639)** best represents the timespan of Japan's closure to Christianity and Europe.
