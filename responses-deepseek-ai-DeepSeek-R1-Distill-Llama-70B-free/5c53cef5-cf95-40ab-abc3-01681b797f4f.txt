Okay, so I have this question about consciousness, and I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me think about what I know about consciousness. From what I remember, consciousness refers to being aware of one's surroundings, thoughts, and feelings. It's like being awake and having a sense of self. I think it's a broader concept than just thinking or problem-solving.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Storage of genetic info—no, that's DNA in cells, so probably not.

Option B: Ability to think—thinking is part of consciousness, but I think consciousness is more than just thinking.

Option C: Ability to talk to oneself—like self-talk, maybe related, but not the whole picture.

Option D: Solve complex math—seems too narrow. Consciousness isn't just about math.

Option E: Breathing and heartbeat—those are autonomic functions, not consciousness.

Option F: Memory recall—again, a part of it, but not all.

Option G: State of wakefulness—this sounds closer. Because when you're awake, you're conscious.

Option H: Brain digesting food—no, that's the digestive system's job, not the brain's.

Option I: Perceive time—maybe part of it, but not the definition.

Option J: Sum of mental experiences—this seems broad, like including thoughts, feelings, awareness.

Wait, I'm a bit confused between G and J. G says wakefulness, which I think is one aspect. But J is the sum total of mental experiences, which might encompass various aspects of consciousness beyond just being awake.

So the question is, what's the exact definition. I've heard that consciousness includes being aware of your environment and your thoughts, which is more than just wakefulness. But sometimes, people use consciousness to mean being awake and aware, which would align with G.

Alternatively, J says it's the sum total of mental experiences, which sounds more comprehensive. So maybe that's the better answer. Because consciousness isn't just wakefulness, it's the experience of being aware of internal and external stimuli.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of some examples. When you're awake, you're conscious. But sometimes, even when you're daydreaming or thinking deeply, you're still conscious. So G is about the state, while J is about the content.

I think the term consciousness refers more to the state of being aware, which includes various mental experiences. So perhaps J is correct because it's the sum of all mental experiences, which would include being aware, thinking, perceiving, etc.

Wait, but another angle: sometimes, people define consciousness as being self-aware or having a sense of self. So J's option is about mental experiences in general, which might include that.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating it. The standard definition from biology or psychology is that consciousness is being aware of one's environment and thoughts, which is wakefulness. So G could be correct.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me recall: in psychology, consciousness refers to your awareness of your surroundings and your internal thoughts. So it's a state, but the term can also encompass the content of that awareness.

So, looking back at the options, J says "sum total of mental experiences." That sounds like it covers all aspects, including thoughts, feelings, perceptions. So J might be the right answer.

Wait, but sometimes "state of wakefulness" is considered the primary definition. Hmm. But I think the broader definition includes the mental experiences. So perhaps J is correct.

I think I'll go with J as the answer.

The term "consciousness" refers to the sum total of mental experiences, encompassing awareness of one's surroundings, thoughts, and feelings. It is a broader concept that includes various aspects of being aware, both internally and externally. While wakefulness is a component of consciousness, the term extends beyond just being awake to include the entirety of mental experiences. Therefore, the correct answer is:

ANSWER: J
