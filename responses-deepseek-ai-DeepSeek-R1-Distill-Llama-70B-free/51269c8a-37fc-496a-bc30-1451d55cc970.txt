Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about client-centered case consultation. Hmm, I remember from my studies that client-centered approaches focus on the client's needs and perspectives, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics of case consultation.

The question is about the primary goal of the consultant. The options are A through J. Let me go through each option and see what I remember.

Option A: Work independently to provide the optimal intervention. That doesn't sound right. Consultants usually work with the consultee, not independently. So probably not A.

Option B: Help the consultee develop a stronger professional identity. I think this might be more about the consultee's personal growth, but I'm not sure if that's the primary goal in case consultation.

Option C: Help identify methods for evaluating services. Evaluation is important, but is that the main focus in case consultation? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option D: Improve communication skills. That sounds more like training or separate development rather than the main goal of case consultation.

Option E: Help consultee work more effectively with a particular client. This rings a bell. I remember that case consultation is often about addressing specific client cases, so the consultant helps the consultee handle that case better.

Option F: Manage professional stress. That's more about self-care, which might be a secondary benefit but not the primary goal.

Option G: Establish a structured plan for future interactions. Structured plans are part of it, but is that the main goal? I'm not sure.

Option H: Work collaboratively to deliver intervention. This sounds good, but I think the consultant isn't delivering the intervention themselves. They're advising the consultee.

Option I: Enhance skills and knowledge for future effectiveness. This seems broader, more about professional development overall, not just for a specific case.

Option J: Identify areas for personal growth. Again, this is more about the consultee's development rather than addressing a specific client situation.

Wait, client-centered case consultation... I think the focus is on helping the consultee work better with the client they're currently dealing with. So the primary goal is to improve the consultee's effectiveness with that particular client. That would align with option E.

Also, I remember that in case consultation, the consultant helps the consultee explore their approaches and strategies for the specific case, rather than focusing on the consultee's general skills or identity. So E seems to fit best.
