Okay, so I have this question here that asks me to determine the number of cubic centimeters in one cubic inch. The options are from A to J, and each gives a different value. I'm a bit rusty on my unit conversions, but let's think this through.

First, I remember that inches and centimeters are units of length, and cubic inches and cubic centimeters are their three-dimensional counterparts. So, to convert between them, I need to consider how inches convert to centimeters and then cube that factor.

Wait, right, 1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters. That's a standard conversion. So if 1 inch is 2.54 cm, then 1 cubic inch would be (2.54 cm)^3. Because when you cube the length, it's length times width times height, so each dimension gets multiplied by the conversion factor.

Let me calculate that. 2.54 cm cubed. Let me break it down. 2.54 times 2.54 is... let me see, 2 times 2 is 4, 2 times 0.54 is about 1.08, 0.54 times 2 is another 1.08, and 0.54 times 0.54 is around 0.2916. Adding those up: 4 + 1.08 + 1.08 + 0.2916. Wait, that's not the right way to do it. Oh wait, no, that's for (a+b)^2. I should just multiply it step by step.

So 2.54 * 2.54. Let's do it properly:

2.54 * 2.54:
Multiply 2.54 by 2, which is 5.08.
Multiply 2.54 by 0.54. Hmm, 2.54 * 0.5 is 1.27, and 2.54 * 0.04 is 0.1016. So 1.27 + 0.1016 is 1.3716.
Now add 5.08 and 1.3716. That gives me 6.4516. So 2.54 squared is 6.4516 cm².

Now I need to multiply that by 2.54 again to get the cubic value. So 6.4516 cm² * 2.54 cm. Let's compute that.

6.4516 * 2 is 12.9032.
6.4516 * 0.54: Let's break that down. 6.4516 * 0.5 is 3.2258, and 6.4516 * 0.04 is 0.258064. Adding those gives 3.2258 + 0.258064 = 3.483864.
Now add the two parts together: 12.9032 + 3.483864 = 16.387064 cm³.

Wait, that's approximately 16.387, which is about 16.39 cubic centimeters. Looking at the options, option F is 16.4 cc. That seems to match.

But wait, let me double-check my calculation because sometimes I might make a mistake in multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I can remember that 1 cubic inch is approximately 16.387 cubic centimeters, which rounds to 16.4. So option F should be correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that 1 inch is 2.54 cm, so 1 in³ = (2.54)^3 cm³. Which is exactly what I did. So yes, the calculation seems right.

To determine the number of cubic centimeters in one cubic inch, we start by knowing that 1 inch equals 2.54 centimeters. To convert cubic inches to cubic centimeters, we cube the conversion factor:

\[
1 \, \text{in}^3 = (2.54 \, \text{cm})^3
\]

First, calculate \(2.54 \times 2.54\):

\[
2.54 \times 2.54 = 6.4516 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

Next, multiply this result by 2.54 to find the cubic value:

\[
6.4516 \times 2.54 = 16.387064 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

Rounding this to one decimal place gives approximately \(16.4 \, \text{cm}^3\). Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**F: 16.4 cc**
