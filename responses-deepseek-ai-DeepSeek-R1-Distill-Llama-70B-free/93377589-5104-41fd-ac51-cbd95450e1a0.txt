Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a rotating coil in a magnetic field. Hmm, I need to find the peak current and the average power supplied to a resistor. Let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when a coil rotates in a magnetic field, it generates an electromotive force (emf) due to electromagnetic induction. The type of emf here is probably alternating current (AC) because the coil is rotating continuously, changing the magnetic flux through it.

The problem gives me a flat coil with 500 turns, each with an area of 50 cm². Wait, I should convert that area into square meters because standard units are needed for calculations. Oh right, 1 cm² is 1e-4 m², so 50 cm² is 50e-4 m², which is 0.005 m².

The coil rotates about a diameter, and the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the magnetic field. The magnetic field intensity is 0.14 Wb/m², and the angular velocity is 150 rad/s. The coil's resistance is 5 ohms, and it's connected via slip rings and brushes to an external resistance of 10 ohms. So there's a total resistance involved when the emf is induced.

Wait, slip rings and brushes mean that the coil is connected to an external circuit without interrupting the rotation, so the generated emf is available continuously. But because it's rotating, the emf will alternate, right?

So the first thing I need to calculate is the peak emf induced in the coil. I think the formula for the peak emf (E₀) in a rotating coil is E₀ = N * B * A * ω, where N is the number of turns, B is the magnetic field, A is the area, and ω is the angular velocity. Let me confirm that. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, the maximum emf (peak) for a rotating coil is given by E₀ = NABω. Yes, that makes sense because when the coil is spinning, the rate of change of flux is maximum when the plane of the coil is perpendicular to the field, leading to the peak emf.

So plugging in the numbers: N is 500, B is 0.14 T, A is 0.005 m², and ω is 150 rad/s.

Calculating that: E₀ = 500 * 0.14 * 0.005 * 150.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 0.14 multiplied by 0.005 is 0.0007. Then, 500 * 0.0007 is 0.35. Multiply that by 150: 0.35 * 150 is 52.5 volts. So the peak emf is 52.5 V.

Now, this emf is alternating, and the coil's resistance is 5 ohms, connected in series with an external resistance of 10 ohms. So the total resistance in the circuit is 5 + 10 = 15 ohms.

Wait, but when dealing with AC circuits, if there's inductance or capacitance, we'd have to consider impedance. But the problem doesn't mention any inductance or capacitance, so I think we can treat this as a purely resistive circuit. So the current will be I = E₀ / R_total for the peak values.

So the peak current I_peak would be 52.5 V divided by 15 ohms. Let's calculate that: 52.5 / 15 is 3.5 amperes. Wait, that's 3.5 A as the peak current.

But wait, I should double-check. The emf is sinusoidal, so the rms (root mean square) value would be E_peak divided by sqrt(2). But the question asks for the peak current, so I think I'm correct in using the peak emf for the peak current.

Wait, but the problem says 'peak current flowing', so yeah, that's correct. So I_peak is 3.5 A.

Wait, looking at the options, option F says peak current 3.5 A, and average power 61.25 W. Option F is one of the choices.

Wait, but wait, no, let me think again. Because the external resistor is 10 ohms, but the coil has its own resistance of 5 ohms. So when current flows, it's flowing through both resistors. So the total resistance is 15 ohms, as I thought earlier.

So the peak current is 52.5 V / 15 ohms = 3.5 A. So the peak current is 3.5 A.

Now for the average power supplied to the 10-ohm resistor. Since the resistor is in the circuit, the average power can be calculated using the rms current squared multiplied by the resistance. Alternatively, since we have the peak current, we can find the rms current as I_rms = I_peak / sqrt(2), and then compute power as I_rms² * R.

Wait, the power in a resistor is V²/R for DC, but for AC, it's (V_rms)^2 / R. Alternatively, since P = I² R, and for AC, P_avg = I_rms² R.

So first, I'll find the rms current. The peak current is 3.5 A, so I_rms is 3.5 / sqrt(2) ≈ 3.5 / 1.414 ≈ 2.474 A.

Then, the average power is (2.474)^2 * 10 ohms. Let me compute that:

2.474 squared is approximately 6.12. 6.12 multiplied by 10 is 61.2 watts. Hmm, looking at option F, the average power is 61.25 W, which is very close to this. Alternatively, perhaps I should do the calculation more accurately.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula for average power in terms of peak values. The average power for a resistor in an AC circuit is (E_peak² / (2 * R_total)) * (R_external / R_total), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the power is split between the two resistors, perhaps it's better to compute the rms current and then find the power in the external resistor.

Wait, the total resistance is 15 ohms. The current through both resistors is the same because they are in series. So the voltage across the external resistor (10 ohms) is I_rms * 10. The power is (I_rms)^2 * 10.

Alternatively, since the external resistor is 10 ohms, the power can be found as (I_peak)^2 * (10/15) * (1/2), because the average power is (1/2) I_peak² R. Because P_avg = (I_peak^2 / 2) * R.

So let's compute that: (3.5)^2 is 12.25. Multiply by 10 ohms gives 122.5. Multiply by (1/2), so 61.25 W. So that's exactly what I get. So the average power is 61.25 W.

But wait, let me think again. Because the current is AC, and the power is the average over a full cycle. The power in a resistor is I_rms squared times R. So I_rms is 3.5 / sqrt(2) ≈ 2.474 A. So (2.474)^2 is about 6.12. 6.12 * 10 = 61.2 W, which is approximately 61.25 W when considering exact fractions.

Wait, using exact fractions: 3.5 is 7/2, so (7/2)^2 = 49/4. Then, 49/4 divided by 2 (since it's rms) is 49/8. So 49/8 multiplied by 10 is 490/8 = 61.25 W exactly.

So the average power is 61.25 W, and the peak current is 3.5 A. Looking back at the options, option F says peak current 3.5 A and average power 61.25 W. So that's the correct answer.

But wait, wait a minute. The question specifies that the induced emf is connected via slip rings and brushes to an external resistor. So the setup is such that the emf is being sent through the external resistor. But in that case, the circuit would consist of the internal resistance (5 ohms) of the coil and the external resistor (10 ohms) in series. So the total resistance is indeed 15 ohms. So my calculations seem correct.

So the peak current is 3.5 A, and the average power is 61.25 W. So option F is correct.

To solve the problem, we calculate the peak current and the average power supplied to the 10-Ω resistor. The coil has 500 turns, each with an area of \( 50 \, \text{cm}^2 = 0.005 \, \text{m}^2 \), and rotates at an angular velocity of \( 150 \, \text{rad/s} \) in a uniform magnetic field of \( 0.14 \, \text{Wb/m}^2 \). The total resistance in the circuit is \( 5 \, \Omega + 10 \, \Omega = 15 \, \Omega \).

### Step 1: Calculate the peak emf
The peak emf induced in the coil is given by:
\[
E_0 = N \cdot B \cdot A \cdot \omega
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
E_0 = 500 \cdot 0.14 \cdot 0.005 \cdot 150 = 52.5 \, \text{V}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the peak current
The peak current is given by Ohm's law:
\[
I_{\text{peak}} = \frac{E_0}{R_{\text{total}}}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
I_{\text{peak}} = \frac{52.5}{15} = 3.5 \, \text{A}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the average power
The average power supplied to the 10-Ω resistor is calculated using the rms current, which is related to the peak current by:
\[
I_{\text{rms}} = \frac{I_{\text{peak}}}{\sqrt{2}}
\]
Substituting \( I_{\text{peak}} = 3.5 \, \text{A} \):
\[
I_{\text{rms}} = \frac{3.5}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 2.474 \, \text{A}
\]
The average power is then:
\[
P_{\text{avg}} = I_{\text{rms}}^2 \cdot R_{\text{external}}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
P_{\text{avg}} = (2.474)^2 \cdot 10 \approx 61.25 \, \text{W}
\]

### Final Answer
The peak current is \( 3.5 \, \text{A} \), and the average power supplied to the 10-Ω resistor is \( 61.25 \, \text{W} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**F: Peak current is 3.5 A, average power is 61.25 W.**
