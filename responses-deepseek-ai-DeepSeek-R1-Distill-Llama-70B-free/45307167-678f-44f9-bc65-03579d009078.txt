Okay, so I need to figure out why House members are more concerned about their committee assignments than senators. Hmm, I remember that in the US Congress, both the House and Senate have committees, but they function a bit differently.

Wait, let me think. The House has more members than the Senateâ€”435 vs. 100. So each representative has a smaller constituency maybe, but how does that affect committees? Oh right, House members typically serve on only one or two committees, while senators can serve on multiple committees. So maybe the number of committees they can be on affects their concern about assignments.

Why would that matter? Well, if a House member is on only one committee, their influence is concentrated there. So getting a good committee assignment is crucial because it's their main way to impact legislation. Senators, on the other hand, can be on several committees, so maybe each individual committee is less critical since they have more avenues to influence legislation.

Looking at the options, option D says "Senators are able to serve on multiple committees at once." That seems to fit because if senators can juggle multiple committees, their focus isn't as intense on a single assignment. House members, limited to fewer committees, care more about which ones they get.

Another option that caught my eye is G: Senate committees don't have as much influence. I don't think that's right. Both House and Senate committees are important, but the structure is different. So G doesn't seem correct.

Option A says House members serve on only one committee. I think that's not entirely accurate. I remember they can serve on a couple, but maybe fewer than senators. So if A is correct, that would explain their concern. But I think the key point is that senators can serve on multiple, making their committee assignments less critical individually.

Wait, another thought. The House has more specialized committees because there are more members. So each member's committee role is a bigger part of their job. But again, the main point is about the number of committees each can join.

So putting it together, the reason House members care more is because they can't serve on as many committees as senators. So D seems to be the correct option.

House members are more concerned about their committee assignments than senators because they typically have fewer opportunities to serve on multiple committees. In the House of Representatives, members usually serve on only one or two committees, making their committee assignments a critical avenue for influencing legislation. In contrast, senators are often able to serve on multiple committees simultaneously, which reduces the intensity of their focus on any single committee assignment. This difference in the number of committees they can join explains why House members are more concerned about their assignments.

The correct answer is:

D: Senators are able to serve on multiple committees at once.

Answer: D
