Question:

What is involved in human discrimination learning?

Options:

A: It is a form of learning that occurs without any external stimuli, relying solely on internal thought processes.
B: Discrimination learning is primarily focused on the physical sensations rather than cognitive recognition of stimuli.
C: It involves the recognition of a single stimulus that changes over time, with rewards and punishments given for recognizing the changes.
D: It involves only the presence of a single stimulus.
E: The process depends on the presence of three or more stimuli, with all being rewarded in a variable manner.
F: The general characteristic involved in both situations is the presence of two stimuli, either simultaneously or successively, where only one of these stimuli is frequently rewarded or punished.
G: Human discrimination learning is the ability to discern between more than two stimuli, none of which are associated with rewards or punishments.
H: It involves a process where a single stimulus is both rewarded and punished at random intervals.
I: It is exclusively related to language acquisition.
J: It is only associated with punishment, not reward.

Okay, so I've got this question about human discrimination learning. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is asking what's involved in human discrimination learning. The options are A through J. I remember that discrimination learning is a concept from psychology, probably related to behaviorism or learning theory.

So, discrimination learning... I think it's about learning to differentiate between different stimuli. Like, in operant conditioning, organisms learn to respond to certain cues. So, for example, a child might learn that doing homework before playing gives a reward, while playing first doesn't. That's a form of discrimination.

Wait, so discrimination learning involves two or more stimuli where the organism learns which ones are associated with rewards or punishments. For example, in a Skinner box, a pigeon might learn to peck a green light but not a red one because the green one gives food.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's without external stimuli, relying on internal thought. No, I don't think so. Discrimination learning involves external stimuli because the organism responds to them.

Option B focuses on physical sensations over cognitive recognition. Maybe, but I think it's more about the stimuli and their associations with rewards, not just the physical feelings.

Option C talks about a single stimulus changing over time, with rewards for recognizing changes. That doesn't sound right. Discrimination is about multiple stimuli, not just one changing.

Option D says only a single stimulus is involved. No, that's not it. Discrimination requires at least two to compare.

Option E mentions three or more stimuli, all rewarded variably. That's a possibility, but I think the key is two stimuli, one rewarded and one not.

Option F states that two stimuli are present, either at the same time or successively, and only one is rewarded or punished. That rings a bell. Discrimination learning typically involves two stimuli where one is associated with a reward and the other isn't. So the organism learns to respond to the correct one.

Option G is about more than two stimuli without rewards. Doesn't fit because rewards are a key part of learning.

Option H is a single stimulus being both rewarded and punished randomly. That sounds more like a variable schedule or maybe something else, not discrimination.

Option I is about language acquisition. I don't think that's specific enough. Discrimination is a broader concept.

Option J is only punishment, no reward. No, both rewards and punishments can be involved.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be F. It involves two stimuli, one rewarded and the other not, either shown together or one after the other.

The correct answer is F. Discrimination learning involves the presence of two stimuli, either simultaneously or successively, where only one is frequently rewarded or punished, allowing the individual to learn the distinction between them.

Answer: F
