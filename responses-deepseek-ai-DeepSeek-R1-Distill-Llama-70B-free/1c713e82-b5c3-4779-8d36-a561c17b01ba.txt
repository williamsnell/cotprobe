Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a nuclear reaction, and I need to find the mass of the neutron. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The reaction given is: 5B^11 + 2He^4 → 7N^14 + 0n^1. Hmm, I remember that in nuclear reactions, the mass on both sides should balance, but because of the energy involved, there's probably some mass defect which relates to the energy using Einstein's equation E=mc².

The problem gives me the masses of the boron, nitrogen, and alpha particle (which is helium-4). The masses are 11.01280 amu, 14.00752 amu, and 4.00387 amu respectively. Wait, but wait a second: the helium is the alpha particle, so in the reactants, it's the helium and boron. So the initial masses are 11.01280 amu (B) and 4.00387 amu (He), right?

But the reaction also involves kinetic energies. The incident alpha particle has 5.250 MeV of kinetic energy. Then, the neutron and nitrogen have energies of 3.260 MeV and 2.139 MeV respectively. Wait, I think I need to consider the conservation of energy here. Oh, but wait, the Q value of the reaction comes into play. The Q value is the energy released or absorbed, and it's related to the mass defect.

Wait, maybe I should approach this using conservation of energy and mass-energy equivalence. Let me jot down what I know.

The initial kinetic energy is the alpha's 5.250 MeV. Then, the products (neutron and nitrogen) have kinetic energies of 3.260 MeV and 2.139 MeV. So the total kinetic energy after is 3.260 + 2.139 = 5.399 MeV. But the initial kinetic energy was 5.250 MeV. Hmm, that's an increase, which suggests that energy was released. So the Q value is positive, meaning the reaction is exothermic.

Wait, but to find the mass of the neutron, maybe I should first calculate the mass defect. The mass defect is the difference between the total mass of the reactants and the total mass of the products. Because some mass is converted into energy (the Q value), but wait, in this case, the Q is the energy released, so the mass of the products is less than the reactants by Q/c².

Wait, but wait: the given masses are the rest masses (since they're given in amu). So the reaction's Q value would be calculated using the rest masses, but the kinetic energies complicate things because the initial and final states have different kinetic energies.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the conservation of energy and momentum to find the mass of the neutron. But I'm not sure how to approach that.

Let me think again. The initial rest mass is the sum of boron and helium. Boron is 11.01280 amu, helium (alpha) is 4.00387 amu. So total initial rest mass is 11.01280 + 4.00387 = 15.01667 amu.

The products are nitrogen (14.00752 amu) and neutron (m_n, which I'm trying to find). So the total rest mass of products is 14.00752 + m_n.

The mass defect Δm is the initial mass minus the product mass: Δm = (11.01280 + 4.00387) - (14.00752 + m_n) = (15.01667) - (14.00752 + m_n) → 15.01667 -14.00752 = 1.00915 amu. So Δm = 1.00915 - m_n.

Wait, but wait, no: because Δm is (reactants rest mass) - (products rest mass). So Δm = (11.0128 +4.00387) - (14.00752 + m_n) → 15.01667 - (14.00752 + m_n) → 15.01667 -14.00752 = 1.00915. So Δm = 1.00915 - m_n.

But then, the Q value of the reaction is the energy equivalent of Δm times c², but also considering the kinetic energies. Because the reaction's Q is the energy released when the reactants are at rest and the products are at rest. So when the alpha has kinetic energy, the actual kinetic energy changes will relate to the Q.

Wait, perhaps I should use the energy conservation. The initial kinetic energy is that of the alpha (5.250 MeV), and the final kinetic energies are those of the neutron (3.260 MeV) and nitrogen (2.139 MeV). So the total initial energy is the rest mass energy of the reactants plus the initial kinetic energy. The total final energy is the rest mass energy of the products plus their kinetic energies.

Wait, so the total energy before reaction (E_initial) is the sum of the rest energy of boron and helium plus their kinetic energies. But wait, the boron is presumably at rest, since it's a target, and the helium is moving with kinetic energy. So the initial kinetic energy is just the alpha's 5.250 MeV.

So:

E_initial = (mass_B * c²) + (mass_He * c²) + K_He

Similarly, the final energy E_final is (mass_N * c²) + (mass_n * c²) + K_N + K_n.

Because energy is conserved, E_initial = E_final.

So:

mass_B c² + mass_He c² + K_He = mass_N c² + mass_n c² + K_N + K_n.

But the kinetic energies are given in MeV. Let me convert everything to the same unit. Let me use amu and convert to energy using c².

I know that 1 amu is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So I can convert the masses into energy units.

So let's compute each term:

mass_B = 11.01280 amu → 11.01280 * 931.5 MeV = let's calculate that.

Similarly for mass_He, mass_N, and mass_n.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to rearrange the equation:

mass_n = mass_B + mass_He - mass_N + (K_He - K_N - K_n)/c².

Wait no, let me rearrange the energy equation.

mass_B c² + mass_He c² + K_He = mass_N c² + mass_n c² + K_N + K_n.

So, solving for mass_n:

mass_n c² = mass_B c² + mass_He c² + K_He - mass_N c² - K_N - K_n.

So,

mass_n = [ (mass_B + mass_He) c² + K_He - mass_N c² - K_N - K_n ] / c².

Wait, perhaps it's better to collect terms. Let me write it as:

mass_n = (mass_B + mass_He - mass_N) + (K_He - K_N - K_n)/c².

Because:

mass_n c² = (mass_B + mass_He)c² - mass_N c² + (K_He - K_N - K_n).

So,

mass_n = (mass_B + mass_He - mass_N) + (K_He - K_N - K_n)/(c²).

Now substituting the known values.

mass_B = 11.01280 amu, mass_He = 4.00387 amu, mass_N = 14.00752 amu.

So,

mass_B + mass_He - mass_N = 11.01280 + 4.00387 -14.00752 = (15.01667) -14.00752 = 1.00915 amu.

Now, the kinetic terms:

K_He =5.250 MeV,

K_N=2.139 MeV,

K_n=3.260 MeV.

So K_He - K_N - K_n = 5.250 - 2.139 -3.260 = let's compute that.

5.250 - 2.139 is 3.111; 3.111 -3.260 = -0.149 MeV.

So (K_He - K_N - K_n) = -0.149 MeV.

Now, to convert this into amu, since 1 amu c² is 931.5 MeV, so 1 MeV is 1/931.5 amu.

So,

(K_He - K_N - K_n) / c² = (-0.149 MeV) / (931.5 MeV/amu) ) = -0.149 / 931.5 amu ≈ -0.0001599 amu.

So,

mass_n = 1.00915 amu + ( -0.0001599 ) amu ≈ 1.00899 amu.

Wait, let me do the calculation more accurately.

0.149 / 931.5 = approximately 0.0001599.

So,

mass_n ≈ 1.00915 - 0.0001599 = 1.00899 amu.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.00899 amu. So that's probably the answer.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations to be sure.

Compute (K_He - K_N - K_n):

5.250 -2.139 = 3.111, then 3.111 -3.260 = -0.149 MeV. Correct.

Convert -0.149 MeV to amu using 1 amu = 931.5 MeV.

-0.149 / 931.5 → let's compute:

0.149 / 931.5 = approximately 0.0001599.

So, 1.00915 - 0.0001599 = 1.00899 amu.

So the neutron mass is approximately 1.00899 amu, which corresponds to option E.

To determine the mass of the neutron in the given nuclear reaction:

**Reaction:**  
\[
 {}_5\text{B}^{11} + {}_2\text{He}^4 \rightarrow {}_7\text{N}^{14} + {}_0\text{n}^1
\]

**Given Data:**  
- Mass of boron (\(m_B\)): \(11.01280 \, \text{amu}\)  
- Mass of helium (\(m_{He}\)): \(4.00387 \, \text{amu}\)  
- Mass of nitrogen (\(m_N\)): \(14.00752 \, \text{amu}\)  
- Kinetic energy of the incident \(\alpha\)-particle (\(K_{He}\)): \(5.250 \, \text{MeV}\)  
- Kinetic energy of the neutron (\(K_n\)): \(3.260 \, \text{MeV}\)  
- Kinetic energy of the nitrogen (\(K_N\)): \(2.139 \, \text{MeV}\)  
- \(1 \, \text{amu} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\).

### Step 1: Conservation of Energy
The total energy before and after the reaction must be conserved. The total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy:

\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}
\]

\[
(m_B c^2 + m_{He} c^2 + K_{He}) = (m_N c^2 + m_n c^2 + K_N + K_n)
\]

Rearranging for \(m_n\):

\[
m_n = m_B + m_{He} - m_N + \frac{K_{He} - K_N - K_n}{c^2}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate Rest Mass Difference
The rest mass difference is:

\[
m_B + m_{He} - m_N = 11.01280 + 4.00387 - 14.00752 = 1.00915 \, \text{amu}
\]

---

### Step 3: Convert Kinetic Energy Difference to Mass
The kinetic energy difference is:

\[
K_{He} - K_N - K_n = 5.250 - 2.139 - 3.260 = -0.149 \, \text{MeV}
\]

Convert this energy difference to mass using \(1 \, \text{amu} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\):

\[
\frac{K_{He} - K_N - K_n}{c^2} = \frac{-0.149}{931.5} \approx -0.0001599 \, \text{amu}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the Neutron Mass
Substitute the values into the equation for \(m_n\):

\[
m_n = 1.00915 - 0.0001599 \approx 1.00899 \, \text{amu}
\]

---

### Final Answer
The mass of the neutron is approximately \(1.00899 \, \text{amu}\), which corresponds to **option E**.
