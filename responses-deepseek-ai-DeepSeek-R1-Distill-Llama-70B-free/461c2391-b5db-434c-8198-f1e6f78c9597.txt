Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the UK Constitution. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me break it down.

The question is asking which statement best describes the UK Constitution. There are options from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says the UK Constitution is a direct copy of the US Constitution. Hmm, I remember that the US has a written constitution with a clear separation of powers, while the UK is different. So I don't think A is correct.

Option B claims it's codified and in a single document. Wait, I thought the UK doesn't have a single document as its constitution. Instead, it's made up of various statutes, conventions, and such. So B is probably wrong.

Option C suggests it can be changed by a simple majority in Parliament. Well, I recall that the UK Parliament is sovereign, so yes, they can change the constitution that way. But is that the best description? Maybe, but I'm not sure yet.

Option D says the judiciary can overturn acts of Parliament. No, that's not right. The UK follows parliamentary supremacy, so the judiciary can't overturn laws passed by Parliament. Unless there's something like the European Court, but that's separate, and even then, it's not part of the UK Constitution per se.

Option E is about a Bill of Rights. The UK does have a Bill of Rights, but I don't think the entire constitution is based on it. It's just one part, so E might not be the best choice.

Option F states the Constitution's power comes solely from Parliament. That sounds a bit off. I think the UK's constitution has multiple sources, including conventions and common law, not just Parliament. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G claims it's based entirely on EU law. No, that's not true, especially since Brexit. Even before, the UK's constitution was broader than just EU law.

Option H says it's uncodified and found in multiple sources. This rings a bell. The UK has an uncodified constitution, meaning it's not in one document. It's made up of various statutes, conventions, case laws, etc. So H seems correct.

Option I says power is only from the sovereign. No, because while the monarch has a role, the actual governance is through Parliament and other institutions. So I is incorrect.

Option J claims it's based solely on common law. That's not right because statutes and conventions also play a big role. So J is out.

So putting it all together, the best answer should be H. It's uncodified and found in multiple sources.
