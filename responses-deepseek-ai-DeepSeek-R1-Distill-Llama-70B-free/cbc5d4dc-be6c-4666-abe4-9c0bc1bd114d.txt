Okay, so I've got this problem about an electric heater, and I'm trying to figure out its power rating. Hmm, let's see. The question says the heater takes 4 amperes from a 120-volt line. I remember that power in electricity is calculated using volts and amperes. But wait, what's the exact formula again?

Oh right, power equals voltage multiplied by current. So P = V * I. Voltage here is 120 volts, and current is 4 amperes. So I should multiply 120 by 4. Let me do that: 120 times 4 is 480. So that gives me 480 watts. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people talk about power factors or resistance. Oh wait, in this case, I think it's just a straightforward multiplication because the problem doesn't mention anything about power factor or phase differences. So I shouldn't worry about that. It's a simple DC or purely resistive AC scenario.

Looking at the options, option D is 480 watts. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check. 120 volts multiplied by 4 amps is indeed 480 watts. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I'm missing anything here.

The power rating of the electric heater is calculated using the formula \( P = V \times I \), where \( V \) is the voltage and \( I \) is the current. Given \( V = 120 \, \text{volts} \) and \( I = 4 \, \text{amperes} \), the power is:

\[
P = 120 \times 4 = 480 \, \text{watts}.
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

D: 480 watts.

Answer: D
