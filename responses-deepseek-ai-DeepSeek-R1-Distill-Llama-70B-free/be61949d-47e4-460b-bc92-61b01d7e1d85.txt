Alright, so I've got this question here: "How many $100 bills does it take to equal one million dollars?" And I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Let me think about this step by step.

Okay, first, I know that each $100 bill is worth 100 dollars. I need to find out how many of these bills add up to exactly one million dollars. So the basic approach is to divide the total amount by the value of each bill.

Let me write that down. One million dollars is $1,000,000. Each bill is $100. So the number of bills would be 1,000,000 divided by 100. 

Hmm, doing the division... 1,000,000 divided by 100. Well, dividing by 100 moves the decimal point two places to the left. So 1,000,000 becomes 10,000. So that would mean 10,000 bills of $100 make up one million dollars.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes when dealing with large numbers, it's easy to slip up. So let me break it down differently. If one $100 bill is $100, then:

- 10 bills would be 10 * 100 = $1,000.
- 100 bills would be 100 * 100 = $10,000.
- 1,000 bills would be 1,000 * 100 = $100,000.
- 10,000 bills would be 10,000 * 100 = $1,000,000.

Yep, that checks out. So 10,000 $100 bills equal one million dollars.

Now looking at the options provided:

A: five hundred thousand → 500,000. That's way too high because 500,000 * 100 = 50,000,000, which is way more than a million.

B: five thousand → 5,000. 5,000 * 100 is 500,000, which is half a million. Not enough.

C: two thousand → 2,000 * 100 = 200,000. Still less than a million.

D: one hundred thousand → 100,000 * 100 = 10,000,000. That's ten million, which is ten times more than needed.

E: one thousand → 1,000 *100 = 100,000. Just a tenth of a million.

F: fifty thousand → 50,000 *100 = 5,000,000. Five million, which is five times more than needed.

G: twenty thousand → 2,000,000. Still double the target.

H: one hundred → 100 *100 = 10,000. Just ten thousand, way too low.

I: one million → That's the total amount, not the number of bills. So that's not it.

J: ten thousand → 10,000 *100 = 1,000,000. Exactly one million. So this must be the correct answer.

Wait a second, I should double-check to make sure I'm not confusing the options. Let me read the options again.

Option J is ten thousand, which matches my calculation. So yes, the correct answer is J.

To determine how many $100 bills equal one million dollars, we divide the total amount by the value of each bill: 

$1,000,000 ÷ $100 = 10,000. 

This means it takes 10,000 $100 bills to equal one million dollars. Among the provided options, the correct answer is **J: ten thousand**.

J
