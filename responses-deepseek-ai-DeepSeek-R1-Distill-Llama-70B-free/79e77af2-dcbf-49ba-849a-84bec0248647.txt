Okay, so I have this physics problem here about blackbody radiation and the wavelengths at which the most energy is emitted at different temperatures. Hmm, I remember that blackbody radiation relates to how objects emit light based on their temperature. Oh right, there's this thing called Wien's Law, which connects the temperature of a blackbody to the peak wavelength of the emitted radiation.

Wait, Wien's Law is lambda max equals some constant divided by the temperature, right? I think the formula is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. What's the value of b again? Oh, it's approximately 2.9 × 10^-3 m·K. But wait, meters can be converted to micrometers by multiplying by 1e6, so 2.9e-3 meters is 2.9e3 micrometers? No, wait, 1 meter is 1e6 micrometers. So 2.9e-3 meters is 2.9e3 micrometers? Wait, 2.9e-3 m = 2900 micrometers, which is 2.9 mm. Hmm, but wait, the options are in micrometers, so I have to be careful with the units.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the exact value of Wien's constant. Oh right, sometimes it's given as 2.8977719×10^-3 m·K. So for the calculation, I'll use approximately 2.898 ×10^-3 m·K, which is 2898 μm·K because 1 m is 1e6 μm, so 2.898e-3 m = 2.898e3 μm. So the formula becomes lambda_max (μm) = (2.898e3 μm·K) / T(K).

But wait, the temperatures given are in Celsius. Oh right, I need to convert them to Kelvin first. So for each temperature, I add 273.15 to the Celsius value.

Let me list the temperatures and convert them:

500°C: 500 + 273.15 = 773.15 K
1000°C: 1000 + 273.15 = 1273.15 K
1500°C: 1500 + 273.15 = 1773.15 K
2500°C: 2500 + 273.15 = 2773.15 K

Now for each, calculate lambda_max = 2898 / T.

Starting with 500°C (773.15 K):

lambda_max = 2898 / 773.15 ≈ let's see, 2898 ÷ 773. Let me compute this. 773 × 3 is 2319; 773 × 3.75 is 773*3=2319, 773*.75=579.75 → 2319+579.75=2898.75. Oh, so approximately 3.75 μm. Wait, that's interesting. So 2898 /773.15 is about 3.75 μm.

Wait, let me calculate more accurately. 773.15 × 3.75 = ?

Well, 700 ×3.75 = 2625. 73.15 ×3.75: 70*3.75=262.5, 3.15*3.75≈11.8125. So 262.5+11.8125=274.3125. So total 2625 +274.3125=2899.3125. So 3.75 μm gives a product just a bit over 2898, so the actual value is slightly less than 3.75. Let me compute 2898 /773.15.

Let me compute 2898 ÷773.15. Let's see, 773.15 ×3.75=2899.3125 as above. So 3.75 would give 773.15 ×3.75=2899.3125, but we have 2898, which is 1.3125 less. So how much is that in terms of the multiplier.

So, 773.15 * x =2898 → x=2898/773.15=approx 3.75 - (1.3125/773.15).

1.3125 /773.15 is approximately 0.0017. So x≈3.75 -0.0017=3.7483 μm. So about 3.75 μm.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check each one.

So first, the 500°C (773 K) case gives ~3.75 μm.

Now for 1000°C: 1273.15 K.

Lambda_max = 2898 /1273.15 → let's compute that.

1273 ×2.28 is about 2900. So 2898/1273 ≈2.28 μm.

Wait, more accurately:

What's 1273.15 ×2.28 =?

1273 *2 =2546, 1273 *0.28=356.44 → total 2546+356.44=2902.44. But we have 2898, which is 4.44 less. So 2.28 *1273.15=2902.44. So 2898 is 4.44 less. So the actual x is 2.28 - (4.44 /1273.15).

4.44/1273≈0.0035. So x≈2.2765 μm, so approximately 2.28 μm.

Wait, but wait, 2898 ÷1273.15 → let me compute 2898 /1273.15.

Using a calculator approach:

1273.15 × 2 = 2546.3 → 2898 -2546.3=351.7 left.

351.7 /1273.15 → 3517/127315 → approximately 0.276. So 2.276 μm, which rounds to 2.28 μm.

So second temperature is about 2.28 μm.

Third temperature: 1500°C →1773.15 K.

Lambda_max=2898 /1773.15 → let's compute.

1773 ×1.63 → 1773 ×1.6=2836.8, 1773 ×0.03=53.19 → total 2889.99, which is close to 2898. So 1.63 gives 2889.99, and we need 2898, which is 8.01 more.

So 8.01 /1773.15 ≈0.0045, so x≈1.6345 μm. So about 1.63 μm.

Wait, but wait, 2898 /1773.15 → let me compute.

Divide 2898 by 1773.15:

1773.15 × 1.63 → 1773 *1.63: 1773*1=1773, 1773*0.6=1063.8, 1773*0.03=53.19 → 1773 +1063.8=2836.8 +53.19=2889.99. So 1.63 gives 2889.99, which is 8.01 less than 2898. So how much more?

8.01 /1773.15 → approximately 0.00452. So 1.63 +0.00452=1.6345 → ~1.63 μm.

But wait, another way, 2898 ÷1773.15 → let me compute 2898 ÷1773.15.

Approximately 2898 /1773 ≈ 1.634.

So 1.63 μm.

Wait, but the options—let me note down the values:

500°C: ~3.75 μm

1000°C: ~2.28 μm

1500°C: ~1.63 μm

2500°C: Let's compute that now.

2500°C is 2773.15 K.

Lambda_max=2898 /2773.15 → let's compute.

2773 ×1.04 = 2773 *1=2773, 2773*0.04=110.92 → 2883.92. That's close to 2898. The difference is 14.08.

So 14.08 /2773.15 → approx 0.00507.

So x=1.04 +0.00507=1.04507 μm.

So approximately 1.05 μm.

Wait, but let me compute 2898 /2773.15 more accurately.

2773.15 ×1.045 → 1 × 2773.15=2773.15, 0.04 ×2773.15=110.926, 0.005 ×2773.15=13.8658.

Adding together: 2773.15 +110.926=2884.076 +13.8658=2897.9418. Oh, that's very close to 2898. So 1.045 gives 2897.94, which is 0.06 less than 2898. So 1.045 + (0.06 /2773.15) → approximately 1.045 + 0.00002 → ~1.04502 μm. So approximately 1.045 μm, which is about 1.05 μm.

Wait, but let me confirm:

1.045 ×2773.15 = ?

Well, 2773.15 ×1 = 2773.15

2773.15 ×0.04 = 110.926

2773.15 ×0.005 =13.86575

Adding these: 2773.15 +110.926 = 2884.076; +13.86575 = 2897.94175. So 1.045 gives 2897.94, which is 0.05925 less than 2898. So to get the exact value, we can compute 0.05925 /2773.15 = approx 2.136e-5. So x=1.045 +0.00002136 =1.04502136 μm → approximately 1.045 μm, which is about 1.05 μm.

So our four values are approximately:

500°C: 3.75 μm

1000°C: 2.28 μm

1500°C:1.63 μm

2500°C:1.05 μm

Now, looking at the options provided.

Option H says:

500C:3.75μm, 1000C:2.28μm, 1500C:1.63μm, 2500C:1.05μm.

That's exactly our calculated values.

Wait, let me check the other options.

Option B: 500C:6.25μm, 1000C:5.78μm, 1500C:4.13μm, 2500C:2.85μm. Those are all larger than our values, so probably wrong.

Option E: 500C:2.95μm, which is smaller than our 3.75μm. So not matching.

Option C: 500C:3.75μm, but 1000C:2.28μm. Wait, 3.75 is correct for 500C, but 1000C is 2.28μm. But looking at the rest, 1500C:2.63μm, which is higher than our 1.63μm. So no, doesn't match.

Option H: yes, exactly matches all four.

So the correct answer should be option H.

To determine the wavelengths at which the most energy is emitted by a blackbody radiator at different temperatures, we use **Wien's Law**: 

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant (\( 2.898 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m·K} \)) and \( T \) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin. The temperatures given are in Celsius, so we convert them to Kelvin by adding \( 273.15 \). The calculations are as follows:

1. **500°C**:  
   \( T = 500 + 273.15 = 773.15 \, \text{K} \)  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{2898}{773.15} \approx 3.75 \, \mu\text{m}
   \]

2. **1000°C**:  
   \( T = 1000 + 273.15 = 1273.15 \, \text{K} \)  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{2898}{1273.15} \approx 2.28 \, \mu\text{m}
   \]

3. **1500°C**:  
   \( T = 1500 + 273.15 = 1773.15 \, \text{K} \)  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{2898}{1773.15} \approx 1.63 \, \mu\text{m}
   \]

4. **2500°C**:  
   \( T = 2500 + 273.15 = 2773.15 \, \text{K} \)  
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{2898}{2773.15} \approx 1.05 \, \mu\text{m}
   \]

Thus, the corresponding wavelengths are:  
- **500°C**: \( 3.75 \, \mu\text{m} \)  
- **1000°C**: \( 2.28 \, \mu\text{m} \)  
- **1500°C**: \( 1.63 \, \mu\text{m} \)  
- **2500°C**: \( 1.05 \, \mu\text{m} \)

Comparing these values with the options provided, **Option H** matches exactly:  
- 500°C: \( 3.75 \, \mu\text{m} \)  
- 1000°C: \( 2.28 \, \mu\text{m} \)  
- 1500°C: \( 1.63 \, \mu\text{m} \)  
- 2500°C: \( 1.05 \, \mu\text{m} \)

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**H**
