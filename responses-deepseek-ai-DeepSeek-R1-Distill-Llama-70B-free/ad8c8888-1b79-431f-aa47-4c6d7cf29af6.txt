Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Boeing 747 taking off. Hmm, let's see. The question says the jet is accelerating at 4 m/sec² during takeoff roll, and it takes 40 seconds to reach takeoff speed. I need to find the takeoff speed and the distance it travels on the ground. The options are multiple choice, so I guess I can calculate both and see which option matches.

Wait, right. So, I remember from kinematics that when you're dealing with constant acceleration, certain equations apply. Let me think about the equations. Oh yeah, the basic ones are:

v = u + at
s = ut + 0.5 a t²

Where v is final velocity, u is initial velocity (which I think is 0 here because it starts from rest), a is acceleration, t is time, and s is the distance.

So for the takeoff speed, the initial velocity u is zero, right? Because the plane starts from rest. So the equation simplifies to v = a * t. Oh wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Yeah, because u is zero, so v = a*t.

So given a is 4 m/s² and time t is 40 seconds, then v should be 4 * 40, which is 160 m/s. Hmm, that's the takeoff speed.

Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options. Option D says takeoff speed 160 m/s and distance 3.2 km. Option H is 180, which is higher. So I'm thinking maybe that's the speed.

Now for the distance. Since the plane starts from rest, the average velocity during acceleration can be used. Alternatively, use the equation s = 0.5 * a * t². Because initial velocity u is zero, so the equation simplifies to that.

So s = 0.5 * 4 * (40)^2. Let me compute that. 40 squared is 1600. Multiply by 4 gives 6400, times 0.5 is 3200 meters. Oh, 3200 meters is 3.2 kilometers.

So that matches option D exactly: 160 m/s and 3.2 km.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute again:

v = a*t = 4 *40 = 160 m/s. Correct.

s = 0.5 * a * t² = 0.5 *4*(40)^2. 40 squared is 1600, times 4 is 6400, times 0.5 is 3200 meters, which is 3.2 km. Yep, that's right.

So looking at the options, D is the one that matches both values. So the answer must be D.

To determine the takeoff speed and distance traveled by the Boeing 747, we use the kinematic equations for constant acceleration:

1. **Takeoff Speed**:  
   The initial velocity \( u \) is 0 (since the plane starts from rest), and the equation simplifies to:  
   \[
   v = a \cdot t
   \]  
   Substituting \( a = 4 \, \text{m/sec}^2 \) and \( t = 40 \, \text{sec} \):  
   \[
   v = 4 \cdot 40 = 160 \, \text{m/sec}
   \]  

2. **Distance Traveled**:  
   Using the equation for distance under constant acceleration:  
   \[
   s = u \cdot t + 0.5 \cdot a \cdot t^2
   \]  
   Since \( u = 0 \), this simplifies to:  
   \[
   s = 0.5 \cdot a \cdot t^2
   \]  
   Substituting \( a = 4 \, \text{m/sec}^2 \) and \( t = 40 \, \text{sec} \):  
   \[
   s = 0.5 \cdot 4 \cdot (40)^2 = 0.5 \cdot 4 \cdot 1600 = 3200 \, \text{m} = 3.2 \, \text{km}
   \]  

Thus, the takeoff speed is \( 160 \, \text{m/sec} \), and the distance traveled is \( 3.2 \, \text{km} \). Comparing these results with the options, the correct choice is:

**D: Takeoff speed is 160 m/sec and the distance is 3.2 km.**
