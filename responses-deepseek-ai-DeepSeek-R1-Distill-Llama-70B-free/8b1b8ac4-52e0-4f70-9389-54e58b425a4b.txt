Okay, so I've got this problem here about ionization of magnesium when energy is added. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that 40.0 kJ of energy is added to 1.00 gram of magnesium atoms in the vapor state. We need to find out the composition of the final mixture. The options involve different percentages of Mg atoms, Mg+ ions, and Mg++ ions.

First, I remember that ionization potential is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom. The first ionization potential is the energy needed to go from Mg to Mg+, and the second is from Mg+ to Mg++. The values given are 735 kJ/mol for the first and 1447 kJ/mol for the second. So, each Mg atom requires a lot of energy to ionize, especially the second ionization.

Wait, but wait. The energy given here is 40 kJ. So I should probably calculate how many moles of magnesium we have and then see how much energy is available per mole.

First, I need the molar mass of magnesium. I think it's around 24.3 grams per mole. So 1.00 gram is 1 / 24.3 ≈ 0.0412 moles. So about 0.0412 mol of Mg atoms.

Now, the energy added is 40 kJ. Let me convert that into kJ per mole to see how much each mole can ionize. So for 0.0412 moles, 40 kJ is 40 kJ / 0.0412 mol ≈ 970 kJ per mole? Wait no, wait. Wait, 40 kJ is for 0.0412 moles, so per mole it's 40 / 0.0412 ≈ 970 kJ per mole. Wait that can't be right. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1.00 gram is 1/24.3 ≈ 0.0412 moles. Total energy is 40 kJ. So per mole, the energy available is 40 kJ / 0.0412 mol ≈ let me calculate that. 40 / 0.0412 is approximately 970 kJ per mole. Oh wait, no, that's 40 divided by 0.0412. So 40 / 0.0412 ≈ 970. So 970 kJ per mole of Mg.

Wait, but wait, the first ionization potential is 735 kJ/mol. So 735 per mole is the energy needed to ionize each Mg atom to Mg+. If I have 970 kJ per mole available, that's more than enough to ionize all the Mg atoms once, right? Because 735 is less than 970. So first, let's see how much energy is needed to ionize all the Mg.

Each mole of Mg requires 735 kJ for first ionization. So for 0.0412 moles, the energy needed is 0.0412 *735 kJ. Let me calculate that: 0.0412 *735 ≈ 30.3 kJ. So to ionize all the Mg atoms to Mg+ (first ionization), it takes about 30.3 kJ.

Wait, but the total energy we added is 40 kJ. So 30.3 kJ is used to ionize all the Mg to Mg+. That leaves us with 40 - 30.3 = 9.7 kJ remaining. Now, what can we do with that remaining 9.7 kJ?

Well, the second ionization potential is 1447 kJ/mol. That's a lot higher than the first. So for the second ionization, each mole of Mg+ requires 1447 kJ to become Mg++. So let's see how much of that we can do with 9.7 kJ.

Again, we're dealing with 0.0412 moles. So how much energy is needed for second ionization per mole is 1447 kJ. So per mole, we have 9.7 kJ available, but for second ionization, each mole needs 1447 kJ. So 9.7 kJ is much less than 1447 kJ. So, how many moles can we ionize the second time?

Let me think: the energy available is 9.7 kJ. The energy needed per mole is 1447 kJ. So moles that can be second-ionized is 9.7 / 1447 ≈ 0.0067 moles. Wait, but wait, that's the amount in moles. But we have 0.0412 moles in total. So 0.0067 / 0.0412 is about 0.1626, so about 16.26% of the Mg+ can be ionized to Mg++.

So, summarizing:

- All the Mg is first ionized to Mg+ (since 30.3 kJ is enough for that).
- Then, with the remaining 9.7 kJ, we can ionize about 16.26% of the Mg+ to Mg++.

So the final mixture would be:

- Mg atoms: 0% (all ionized)
- Mg+: 100% - 16.26% = 83.74%
- Mg++: 16.26%

Looking at the options, let me see:

Option H says Mg++ 16.5%, Mg+ 83.5%. That's very close to our calculation. So the correct answer should be option H.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let's recalculate the numbers.

Total moles of Mg: 1.00 g / 24.305 g/mol ≈ 0.04116 mol.

Energy required to first ionize all: 0.04116 *735,000 J. Let me compute that. 0.04116 *735 = approx 30.26 kJ.

Energy remaining: 40 -30.26 =9.74 kJ.

Energy per mole for second ionization: 1447 kJ/mol.

Moles that can be second ionized: 9.74 kJ / 1447 kJ/mol = 0.00673 mol.

Percentage of total Mg that's Mg++: (0.00673 /0.04116)*100 ≈16.33%.

So, yes, about 16.33% Mg++. So Mg+ is 83.67%, which rounds to 83.5% and 16.5% respectively. So option H is the closest.
</think>

To determine the composition of the final mixture, we start by calculating the number of moles of magnesium. The molar mass of magnesium is approximately 24.305 g/mol, so:

\[
\text{Moles of Mg} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{24.305 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.0412 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Next, we calculate the energy required to ionize all the magnesium atoms. The first ionization potential of magnesium is 735 kJ/mol, so the energy needed to fully ionize 0.0412 moles of Mg to Mg+ is:

\[
\text{Energy for first ionization} = 0.0412 \, \text{mol} \times 735 \, \text{kJ/mol} \approx 30.3 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

Since 40.0 kJ of energy is added, the remaining energy after the first ionization is:

\[
\text{Remaining energy} = 40.0 \, \text{kJ} - 30.3 \, \text{kJ} = 9.7 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

This remaining energy can be used for the second ionization. The second ionization potential of magnesium is 1447 kJ/mol, so the number of moles of Mg+ that can be ionized to Mg++ is:

\[
\text{Moles of Mg+ ionized to Mg++} = \frac{9.7 \, \text{kJ}}{1447 \, \text{kJ/mol}} \approx 0.0067 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The percentage of the total magnesium that is ionized to Mg++ is:

\[
\text{Percentage of Mg++} = \left( \frac{0.0067}{0.0412} \right) \times 100 \approx 16.26\%.
\]

Thus, the composition of the final mixture is:

- **Mg atoms**: 0% (all Mg atoms are ionized to Mg+).
- **Mg+**: \( 100\% - 16.26\% = 83.74\% \).
- **Mg++**: \( 16.26\% \).

The closest option to this result is **Option H: Mg++ 16.5%, Mg+ 83.5%**.
