Okay, so I've got this problem about vector spaces and changing coordinates between different bases. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup is that we have a finite-dimensional vector space V over a field F. There are two bases, M1 and M2. M1 consists of vectors a1, a2, a3, and M2 has b1, b2, b3. 

The problem gives me the coordinates of each bi in terms of M1. So, b1 has coordinates (1,1,-1) under M1, which I think means that b1 = 1*a1 + 1*a2 + (-1)*a3. Similarly, b2 is (1,-1,1), so b2 = a1 - a2 + a3. And b3 is (-1,1,1), so b3 = -a1 + a2 + a3.

Now, there's a vector d in V whose coordinates under M1 are (1,3,5). So, d = 1*a1 + 3*a2 +5*a3. I need to find the coordinates of d under M2, which I'll call (x, y, z), such that d = x*b1 + y*b2 + z*b3.

Wait, but how do I find x, y, z? Oh right, I remember something about change of basis matrices. Since each bi is expressed in terms of M1, I can write a matrix where each column is the coordinate vector of bi in M1. Then, to find the coordinates of d in M2, I might need to invert this matrix and multiply by the coordinates of d in M1.

So, let's construct the matrix. The columns are the coordinates of b1, b2, b3 in M1. So the matrix, let's call it C, looks like:

C = | 1  1 -1 |
    | 1 -1  1 |
    |-1  1  1 |

Wait, but I think I might have the rows and columns mixed up. Because each coordinate is a column vector, so each bi's coordinate vector is a column in the matrix. So yes, that's correct.

Then, the coordinates of d in M2 should be C^-1 multiplied by the coordinates of d in M1. Because [d]_M2 = C^-1 [d]_M1.

So, [d]_M1 is (1,3,5), which as a column vector is:

|1|
|3|
|5|

So, I need to compute C^-1 multiplied by this vector.

Wait, but finding the inverse of a 3x3 matrix can be a bit involved. Maybe I should compute it step by step.

First, let me write down matrix C:

Row 1: 1, 1, -1

Row 2: 1, -1, 1

Row 3: -1, 1, 1

I need to find its inverse. Hmm, the inverse of a matrix C is (1/det(C)) * adjugate(C). So first, I should compute the determinant of C.

Calculating determinant of C:

det(C) = 1*( (-1)(1) - (1)(1) ) - 1*(1*1 - (-1)*1) + (-1)*(1*1 - (-1)*(-1)) 

Wait, let me expand along the first row.

det(C) = 1*( (-1)(1) - (1)(1) ) - 1*( (1)(1) - (-1)(1) ) + (-1)*( (1)(1) - (-1)(-1) )

Let me compute each minor:

First term: 1*( (-1)(1) - (1)(1) ) = 1*(-1 -1) = 1*(-2) = -2

Second term: -1*( (1)(1) - (-1)(1) ) = -1*(1 +1) = -1*2 = -2

Third term: (-1)*( (1)(1) - (1)(1) ) = (-1)*(1-1)= (-1)*0=0

So det(C) = (-2) + (-2) + 0 = -4

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation because I might have messed up the signs.

Wait, the cofactor expansion for the first row is:

C11 * M11 - C12 * M12 + C13 * M13

Because the signs alternate starting with positive for (1,1).

Wait, so for a 3x3 matrix, the determinant is:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]

So, applying this to our C:

a=1, b=1, c=-1

d=1, e=-1, f=1

g=-1, h=1, i=1

So det = 1*( (-1)(1) - (1)(1) ) - 1*( (1)(1) - (1)(-1) ) + (-1)*( (1)(1) - (-1)(-1) )

Compute each part:

First term: 1*( (-1)(1) - 1*1 ) = 1*(-1 -1) = 1*(-2) = -2

Second term: -1*( (1*1) - (1*(-1)) ) = -1*(1 +1) = -1*2 = -2

Third term: (-1)*( (1*1) - (-1)*(-1) ) = (-1)*(1 -1) = (-1)*0 = 0

So det = (-2) + (-2) +0 = -4. So determinant is -4.

Now, to find the adjugate matrix, which is the transpose of the cofactor matrix.

Let me compute the matrix of minors, then apply the cofactor signs, then transpose.

Compute minors for each element:

M11: determinant of submatrix obtained by removing row 1, column 1:

| -1  1 |
|  1  1 |

Determinant: (-1)(1) - (1)(1) = -1 -1 = -2

M12: remove row1, column2:

|1  1|
|-1 1|

Determinant: (1)(1) - (1)(-1) = 1 +1 = 2

M13: remove row1, column3:

|1 -1|
|-1 1|

Determinant: (1)(1) - (-1)(-1) = 1 -1 = 0

M21: remove row2, column1:

|1  -1|
|1   1 |

Determinant: (1)(1) - (-1)(1) = 1 +1 = 2

M22: remove row2, column2:

|1  -1|
|-1  1 |

Determinant: (1)(1) - (-1)(-1) = 1 -1 = 0

M23: remove row2, column3:

|1  1|
|-1 1|

Determinant: (1)(1) - (1)(-1) = 1 +1 = 2

M31: remove row3, column1:

|1  -1|
|-1  1 |

Determinant: (1)(1) - (-1)(-1) = 1 -1 = 0

M32: remove row3, column2:

|1  -1|
|1   1 |

Determinant: (1)(1) - (-1)(1) = 1 +1 = 2

M33: remove row3, column3:

|1  1|
|1 -1|

Determinant: (1)(-1) - (1)(1) = -1 -1 = -2

Now, cofactors are minors multiplied by (-1)^(i+j):

C11: (+) M11 = (-2)

C12: (-) M12 = -2

C13: (+) M13 = 0

C21: (-) M21 = -2

C22: (+) M22 = 0

C23: (-) M23 = -2

C31: (+) M31 = 0

C32: (-) M32 = -2

C33: (+) M33 = (-2)

So the cofactor matrix is:

[ -2   -2    0  ]
[ -2    0   -2  ]
[  0   -2   -2  ]

Now, the adjugate matrix is the transpose of this cofactor matrix.

Transposing, the rows become columns:

First row of transpose: -2, -2, 0

Second row: -2, 0, -2

Third row: 0, -2, -2

Wait, no. Wait, the cofactor matrix is:

Row 1: -2, -2, 0

Row 2: -2, 0, -2

Row 3: 0, -2, -2

So the transpose (adjugate) is:

Columns become rows.

So first column becomes first row:

-2, -2, 0

Second column becomes second row:

-2, 0, -2

Third column becomes third row:

0, -2, -2

Wait, no, that's the same as the cofactor matrix. Wait, no, when you transpose, each row becomes a column. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, the cofactor matrix is:

Row 1: C11, C12, C13 → -2, -2, 0

Row 2: C21, C22, C23 → -2, 0, -2

Row 3: C31, C32, C33 → 0, -2, -2

The transpose would be:

Column 1 becomes Row 1: C11, C21, C31 → -2, -2, 0

Column 2 becomes Row 2: C12, C22, C32 → -2, 0, -2

Column 3 becomes Row 3: C13, C23, C33 → 0, -2, -2

Wait, that's the same as the cofactor matrix. So the adjugate is the same as the cofactor matrix in this case? That can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the cofactor signs.

Wait, let me double-check the cofactor signs. The (i+j) for each element:

C11: i=1, j=1 → (+) → correct.

C12: i=1, j=2 → (-) → correct.

C13: i=1, j=3 → (+) → correct.

C21: i=2, j=1 → (-) → correct.

C22: i=2, j=2 → (+) → correct.

C23: i=2, j=3 → (-) → correct.

C31: i=3, j=1 → (+) → correct.

C32: i=3, j=2 → (-) → correct.

C33: i=3, j=3 → (+) → correct.

So the cofactors are correct. So the adjugate is the transpose, which as I wrote above, is the same as the cofactor matrix in this specific case? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because the cofactor matrix is:

Row1: -2, -2, 0

Row2: -2, 0, -2

Row3: 0, -2, -2

So the transpose would be:

Column1: -2, -2, 0 → becomes Row1: -2, -2, 0

Column2: -2, 0, -2 → becomes Row2: -2, 0, -2

Column3: 0, -2, -2 → becomes Row3: 0, -2, -2

Wait, that's the same as the original cofactor matrix. Hmmm, maybe in this specific case, the cofactor matrix is symmetric, so its transpose is the same. Interesting.

So the adjugate matrix is:

[ -2  -2   0 ]

[ -2   0  -2 ]

[  0  -2  -2 ]

Now, the inverse of C is (1/det(C)) * adjugate(C). Since det(C) is -4, the inverse is (1/-4) times the adjugate matrix.

So inverse C is:

(1/-4) * [ -2  -2   0 ]

           [ -2   0  -2 ]

           [  0  -2  -2 ]

Multiplying each element by (-1/4):

First row: (-2)(-1/4)= 0.5, (-2)(-1/4)=0.5, 0*(-1/4)=0.

Second row: (-2)(-1/4)=0.5, 0*(-1/4)=0, (-2)(-1/4)=0.5.

Third row: 0*(-1/4)=0, (-2)(-1/4)=0.5, (-2)(-1/4)=0.5.

So inverse of C is:

[ 0.5   0.5    0 ]

[ 0.5    0    0.5 ]

[ 0     0.5   0.5 ]

Wait, let me confirm each element:

First row:

(-2)*(-1/4) = 0.5

(-2)*(-1/4) = 0.5

0*(-1/4) = 0

Second row:

(-2)*(-1/4)=0.5

0*(-1/4)=0

(-2)*(-1/4)=0.5

Third row:

0*(-1/4)=0

(-2)*(-1/4)=0.5

(-2)*(-1/4)=0.5

Yes, that's correct.

Now, I need to multiply this inverse matrix by the coordinate vector of d in M1, which is [1; 3; 5].

So the multiplication is:

[0.5 0.5 0]   [1]   = 0.5*1 + 0.5*3 + 0*5 = 0.5 + 1.5 + 0 = 2

[0.5 0 0.5] * [3]   = 0.5*1 + 0*3 + 0.5*5 = 0.5 + 0 + 2.5 = 3

[0   0.5 0.5]  [5]   = 0*1 + 0.5*3 + 0.5*5 = 0 + 1.5 + 2.5 = 4

Wait, wait, let me compute each component step by step.

First component:

(0.5)(1) + (0.5)(3) + (0)(5) = 0.5 + 1.5 + 0 = 2.

Second component:

(0.5)(1) + (0)(3) + (0.5)(5) = 0.5 + 0 + 2.5 = 3.

Third component:

(0)(1) + (0.5)(3) + (0.5)(5) = 0 + 1.5 + 2.5 = 4.

So the coordinates of d in M2 are (2,3,4), which would correspond to option A.

Wait, let me check the options given:

Option A: [2,3,4]

Yes, that's option A. So the answer should be A.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to determine the coordinates of the vector \( d \) under the basis \( M2 \), given its coordinates under \( M1 \). The steps involve constructing the change-of-basis matrix from \( M1 \) to \( M2 \), finding its inverse, and using the inverse to transform the coordinates of \( d \).

### Step 1: Construct the change-of-basis matrix
The coordinates of \( b_1, b_2, b_3 \) under \( M1 \) are given as:
\[
c_1 = (1, 1, -1), \quad c_2 = (1, -1, 1), \quad c_3 = (-1, 1, 1).
\]
These vectors form the columns of the change-of-basis matrix \( C \):
\[
C = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & -1 \\
1 & -1 & 1 \\
-1 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the determinant of \( C \)
The determinant of \( C \) is calculated as:
\[
\det(C) = 1 \cdot [(-1)(1) - (1)(1)] - 1 \cdot [(1)(1) - (-1)(1)] + (-1) \cdot [(1)(1) - (-1)(1)].
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\det(C) = 1 \cdot (-2) - 1 \cdot (2) + (-1) \cdot (0) = -2 - 2 + 0 = -4.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the adjugate of \( C \)
The adjugate of \( C \) is the transpose of the cofactor matrix. The cofactor matrix is computed by finding the minors and applying the appropriate signs. The cofactor matrix is:
\[
\text{Cofactor Matrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
-2 & -2 & 0 \\
-2 & 0 & -2 \\
0 & -2 & -2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The adjugate matrix is the transpose of the cofactor matrix:
\[
\text{Adjugate Matrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
-2 & -2 & 0 \\
-2 & 0 & -2 \\
0 & -2 & -2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the inverse of \( C \)
The inverse of \( C \) is given by:
\[
C^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(C)} \cdot \text{Adjugate Matrix}.
\]
Substituting \( \det(C) = -4 \):
\[
C^{-1} = \frac{1}{-4} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
-2 & -2 & 0 \\
-
