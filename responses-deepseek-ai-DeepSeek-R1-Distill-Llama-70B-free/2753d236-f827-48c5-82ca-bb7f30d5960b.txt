Okay, so I have this cybersecurity question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again. The question is asking which concept does NOT form part of the technical discourse on cybersecurity. The options are from A to I.

Hmm, I remember that cybersecurity involves a lot of technical stuff. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A is Social networking. Wait, social networking... I think that's more about how people connect online, like Facebook or Twitter. But wait, isn't social engineering a part of cybersecurity? Oh right, social engineering attacks use social networks to trick people. So social networking is related because it's a platform where cyber attacks can happen.

Option B is Business networks. Business networks are definitely part of cybersecurity because they involve securing internal company networks, protecting data, etc. So B is related.

Option C is Computer experts. Computer experts are the ones who work in cybersecurity, so that's definitely part of the discourse. They're the ones implementing security measures.

Option D is Computer networks. Computer networks are a big part of cybersecurity. Securing networks from attacks, making sure data is safe while it's transmitted. So D is definitely part of it.

Option E is Internet of Things. IoT devices are a big target for cyber attacks because many aren't secured properly. So E is definitely part of cybersecurity discussions.

Option F is Cloud storage. Cloud storage security is a major topic. Protecting data stored in the cloud, ensuring it's encrypted, access controls, etc. So F is related.

Option G is Mobile technology. Mobile devices are a big part of cybersecurity too. Securing mobile apps, preventing malware on phones, etc. So G is part of it.

Option H is Firewall protection. Firewalls are a fundamental security tool. They monitor and control traffic based on set rules. So H is definitely part of cybersecurity.

Option I is Anti-virus industry. Antivirus software is a basic security measure. The industry provides tools to detect and remove malware, so I is related.

So looking back at the options, which one is NOT part of the technical discourse? Let me think. The question is about which does NOT form part of it. So the odd one out.

Wait, option C is Computer experts. But wait, while experts are involved, the term 'computer experts' is more about the people rather than the technical aspects or components of cybersecurity itself. The other options are all technologies, tools, or systems related to cybersecurity. Computer experts are more like the practitioners, not the technical elements or concepts within the field.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is A, Social networking, because it's more of a social aspect rather than a technical one. But earlier I thought social engineering uses social networks, so it's related.

Wait, the question is about technical discourse. So it's about the technical aspects. Social networking is a platform, but the technical side of it would relate to how it's secured. But if the concept itself is more about the social aspect, then maybe it's not part of the technical discourse.

Alternatively, maybe option C: Computer experts. The technical discourse would focus on technologies and methods, not the people. So the concept of computer experts doesn't form part of the technical aspects themselves but rather the human element.

So the answer is either A or C. I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, the question is which does NOT form part of the technical discourse. So, technical discourse would include technologies, tools, measures, etc. So social networking as a concept is about the social aspect, not the technical. Whereas computer experts are people, not a technical concept.

So perhaps option C is the correct answer because it's about people, not a technical component.

Alternatively, option A is about a platform that's used, but cybersecurity does involve securing these platforms. So maybe A is part of it.

Wait, but the question is about which does NOT form part. So which is outside the technical aspects. Computer experts are part of the field but not a technical concept themselves. So option C is the one that doesn't fit as a technical concept.

Alternatively, maybe option A is the answer because social networking is a social concept, not a technical one. But I'm not sure.

I think I'm getting stuck between A and C. Let me think again.

Cybersecurity technical discourse includes things like firewalls, antivirus, cloud security, IoT, etc. Social networking can be a vector for attacks, so it's part of the discourse in terms of threats. But as a standalone concept, is it considered part of the technical discourse? Or is it more of a separate field.

Alternatively, computer experts are essential but are they part of the technical concepts? No, they're the practitioners. So the concepts are more about technologies and processes, not the people.

So the answer would be C: Computer experts. Because the other options are all technologies or systems, while computer experts are people involved in the field, not a technical concept themselves.

The question asks which concept does NOT form part of the technical discourse on cybersecurity. To determine this, it's important to analyze each option and identify whether it pertains to technical aspects of cybersecurity or not.

- **Option A: Social networking**  
  Social networking platforms can be vectors for cyber attacks, such as social engineering. While the concept of social networking itself is more about connecting people, its security aspects are part of cybersecurity discussions. Thus, it is related to the technical discourse.

- **Option B: Business networks**  
  Business networks involve securing internal company data and systems, which is a core part of cybersecurity. Therefore, this is part of the technical discourse.

- **Option C: Computer experts**  
  Computer experts are the practitioners who implement and manage cybersecurity measures. However, the concept of "computer experts" refers to people rather than a technical aspect or component of cybersecurity itself. This makes it the odd one out in the context of technical discourse.

- **Option D: Computer networks**  
  Securing computer networks is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity, making this part of the technical discourse.

- **Option E: Internet of Things (IoT)**  
  IoT devices are frequently targeted in cyber attacks, and their security is a significant topic in cybersecurity. Thus, this is part of the technical discourse.

- **Option F: Cloud storage**  
  Cloud storage security involves protecting data stored remotely, which is a key area in cybersecurity. Therefore, this is part of the technical discourse.

- **Option G: Mobile technology**  
  Securing mobile devices and applications is an essential part of cybersecurity, making this part of the technical discourse.

- **Option H: Firewall protection**  
  Firewalls are a critical security tool in cybersecurity, used to monitor and control network traffic. This is part of the technical discourse.

- **Option I: Anti-virus industry**  
  Antivirus software is a basic yet crucial tool in cybersecurity, used to detect and remove malware. Thus, this is part of the technical discourse.

After analyzing all options, **Option C: Computer experts** stands out as the concept that does NOT form part of the technical discourse on cybersecurity. While computer experts are essential to the field, they represent the human element rather than a technical concept or component.
