Okay, so I have this question about the Ricardian theory of land rents and the single-tax movement in the late nineteenth century. I'm a bit rusty on my economics history, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that David Ricardo was a classical economist. His theory on land rents, I think, explains that landowners earn rent because of the scarcity of land and its varying fertility. The idea is that as population grows, more marginal land is used, which isn't as productive. The owners of the more fertile land can charge higher rents because farmers are willing to pay more to use the better land.

Now, the single-tax movement. I've heard this term before, probably related to Henry George. Oh right, Henry George's book "Progress and Poverty" proposed the idea of a single tax on land. The movement's goal was to tax only the value of land, not the improvements made on it, like buildings. The rationale was that the value of land increases due to the community around it, not because of the landowner's efforts. So, taxing land would capture the unearned gains that landowners receive.

The question is asking about the goal and rationale of the single-tax movement. The options are A through J. The goal was to eliminate all other taxes and only have a tax on land. So looking at the options, option A says "To eliminate all taxes but a tax on land". That sounds right.

Wait, let me check other options to be sure. Option B is about taxing corporate profits, which doesn't fit. Option C talks about wealth and capital gains—no, that's different. Option D is replacing all taxes with an income tax. No, the single-tax was on land, not income. Option E is eliminating all taxes, which is incorrect because they wanted to keep the land tax. Option F is a consumption tax—nope. G is a flat tax on all income, not it. H is about trade taxes, which isn't related. I is reducing land taxes, which is the opposite. J is increasing all taxes, which doesn't fit.

So the correct answer should be A. The movement aimed to have only a land tax and eliminate other taxes. The rationale was based on Ricardo's theory, which they believed showed that land rents were unearned and could be taxed without discouraging productivity.

The Ricardian theory of land rents, developed by David Ricardo, explains that landowners earn rent due to the scarcity and varying fertility of land. The single-tax movement, influenced by Henry George, aimed to implement a single tax on land value, excluding improvements like buildings. The rationale was that land value increases due to community factors, not landowners' efforts, making it a fair source of taxation. The movement sought to eliminate all other taxes, keeping only the land tax.

Answer: A
