Okay, so I have this question about the loudness of a sound and what it's related to. Hmm, I remember from my science classes that sound has a few different characteristics. Let me think. I know that sound is a wave, right? So it has properties like amplitude, wavelength, frequency, and so on.

The question is asking about loudness. I think loudness has to do with how strong the sound is. Oh wait, I remember that amplitude is the height of the wave, which I think relates to how loud it is. Because a higher amplitude means the wave has more energy, so it's louder. So that would connect loudness to amplitude.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. What about the other options? Like, pitch is related to frequency. Frequency is how many waves pass by per second, measured in Hertz. So higher frequency means a higher pitch. So G is frequency and H is pitch, but that's not related to loudness.

Timbre is like the quality of the sound, what makes a guitar sound different from a piano even if they play the same note. So that's A: timbre. Not related to loudness.

Wavelength is the distance between two peaks of the wave. Wavelength and frequency are inversely related because when one increases, the other decreases, assuming the speed of sound is constant. So B is wavelength, but I don't think that's directly linked to loudness. Maybe indirectly, but not the main factor.

Duration is how long the sound lasts. Like, whether it's a short beep or a long note. So C is duration. That doesn't affect how loud it is, just how long it's heard.

Period is the time it takes for one complete wave cycle. So D is period. Since period is the reciprocal of frequency, it's related to pitch again, not loudness.

E is tone. Tone is sometimes used interchangeably with pitch, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, tone also relates to the quality, like timbre. So E and A might be similar. Either way, not about loudness.

F is resonance. Resonance is when a system vibrates at a specific frequency, like when you hit a glass and it rings. It can affect the quality and maybe the loudness in certain contexts, but I don't think it's the primary factor for loudness in general.

Velocity, I, is the speed of the sound wave. The speed of sound in air is around 343 m/s at 20Â°C. Velocity is more about how fast the sound travels, not how loud it is. So I is velocity.

So putting it all together, the loudness is most closely related to the amplitude of the sound wave. So the correct answer should be J: amplitude.

The loudness of a sound is most closely related to its amplitude. Amplitude determines the intensity of the sound wave, with higher amplitudes corresponding to louder sounds. Other characteristics like pitch (related to frequency) and timbre (related to sound quality) do not directly affect loudness. 

Answer: J
