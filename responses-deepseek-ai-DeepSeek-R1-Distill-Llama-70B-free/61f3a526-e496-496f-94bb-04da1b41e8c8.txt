Okay, so I need to figure out Buzz Reinhaus's total earnings for last week. Let's see, the problem gives me his hours worked and the pay rates for different parts of those hours. Hmm, I think I should break this down step by step.

Alright, Buzz worked a total of 63 hours last week. But wait, how are these hours divided between regular, time and a half, and double time? Oh, the question says he was paid time and a half for 15 hours and double time for 9 hours. So that's 15 plus 9, which is 24 hours. That leaves the remaining hours as regular pay.

So, 63 total hours minus 24 (15+9) equals 39 hours. So 39 hours at regular pay, 15 at time and a half, and 9 at double time.

His regular rate is $2.60 per hour. Got it. Now I need to calculate each part and sum them up.

Regular pay: 39 hours * $2.60. Let me calculate that. 39 * 2 is 78, and 39 * 0.6 is 23.4, so total is 78 + 23.4 = $101.40.

Time and a half means 1.5 times the regular rate. So 1.5 * $2.60. Let me compute that. 2.60 * 1 = 2.60, 2.60 * 0.5 = 1.30. So 2.60 + 1.30 = $3.90 per hour for time and a half. He worked 15 hours at this rate. So 15 * 3.90. Let me see, 10*3.90 is 39, and 5*3.90 is 19.5, so total is 39 +19.5 = $58.50.

Double time is twice the regular rate. So 2 * $2.60 = $5.20 per hour. He worked 9 hours here. So 9 * 5.20. Hmm, 9*5 is 45, and 9*0.2 is 1.8. So 45 + 1.8 = $46.80.

Now, adding all three parts together: regular ($101.40) + time and a half ($58.50) + double time ($46.80). Let me sum them up.

101.40 +58.50 is 159.90. Then 159.90 +46.80 is 206.70. So his total earnings should be $206.70.

Looking at the options, option B is $206.70. So the answer should be B.

To calculate Buzz Reinhaus's total earnings for the week, we break down his 63 hours of work into three categories: regular pay, time and a half, and double time.

1. **Regular Pay**:  
   Buzz worked 39 hours at his regular rate of $2.60 per hour.  
   Calculation:  
   \[
   39 \text{ hours} \times \$2.60/\text{hour} = \$101.40
   \]

2. **Time and a Half**:  
   Buzz worked 15 hours at 1.5 times his regular rate.  
   Calculation:  
   \[
   1.5 \times \$2.60 = \$3.90/\text{hour}  
   \]  
   Total for 15 hours:  
   \[
   15 \times \$3.90 = \$58.50
   \]

3. **Double Time**:  
   Buzz worked 9 hours at 2 times his regular rate.  
   Calculation:  
   \[
   2 \times \$2.60 = \$5.20/\text{hour}  
   \]  
   Total for 9 hours:  
   \[
   9 \times \$5.20 = \$46.80
   \]

4. **Total Earnings**:  
   Adding all components together:  
   \[
   \$101.40 + \$58.50 + \$46.80 = \$206.70
   \]

Thus, Buzz's total earnings for the week are **$206.70**, which corresponds to option **B**.
