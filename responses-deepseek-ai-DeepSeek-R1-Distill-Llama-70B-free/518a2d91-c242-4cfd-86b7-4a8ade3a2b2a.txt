Okay, so I have this question about capacitors, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is asking which of the options would increase the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor. Alright, I remember that capacitance depends on a few factors, so let's think about the formula.

I think the formula for capacitance (C) of a parallel-plate capacitor is C = ε₀ε_r * A / d. Where ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity, ε_r is the relative permittivity or dielectric constant of the material between the plates, A is the area of the plates, and d is the distance between them. 

So the factors that affect capacitance are the dielectric constant, the area, and the distance between the plates. Voltage isn't directly in that formula, so changes in voltage might not affect capacitance itself, but maybe the charge or something else. 

Looking at the options now:

Option A: Decreasing the voltage between the plates. Wait, voltage (V) relates to charge (Q) and capacitance (C) via Q = CV. If voltage decreases and C stays the same, then Q decreases. But does changing the voltage change C? I don't think so. So this might not affect capacitance.

Option B: Using a dielectric with zero dielectric constant. Oh wait, dielectric constant ε_r is the relative permittivity. If ε_r is zero, that would make the capacitance zero because C would be zero. That doesn't increase capacitance. So B is bad.

Option C: Using smaller plates. The area A is smaller, which would decrease C because C is proportional to A. So C would decrease, so this isn't the answer.

Option D: Moving the plates closer together. The distance d decreases. Since C is inversely proportional to d, decreasing d would increase C. That sounds right. So D could be the correct answer.

Option E: Moving the plates further apart. That increases d, which would decrease C. So E isn't correct.

Option F: Increasing the voltage. As earlier, voltage doesn't directly affect C. Unless changing voltage somehow causes another effect. But no, in the formula, C doesn't depend on V. So F doesn't change C.

Option G: Replacing dielectric with smaller ε_r. ε_r is in the numerator. If it's smaller, C decreases. So G would decrease C, so not the answer.

Option H: Increasing the distance between the plates. As in E and H, that would increase d, so C decreases. So H isn't correct.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D. Moving the plates closer increases capacitance because the distance d is smaller. And I think other options either don't affect C or decrease it.

To determine which option increases the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor, we use the formula for capacitance:

\[
C = \frac{\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r A}{d}
\]

Here, capacitance \(C\) depends on the dielectric constant (\(\varepsilon_r\)), the plate area (\(A\)), and the distance between the plates (\(d\)). Voltage (\(V\)) does not directly affect capacitance, as \(C\) is independent of \(V\) in this formula.

**Analysis of the options:**

- **A:** Decreasing the voltage does not affect capacitance, as \(C\) is independent of \(V\).  
- **B:** A dielectric constant of zero would eliminate capacitance entirely, as \(C\) would become zero.  
- **C:** Smaller plates reduce the area \(A\), which decreases capacitance.  
- **D:** Moving the plates closer together reduces \(d\), and since \(C\) is inversely proportional to \(d\), this increases capacitance.  
- **E:** Moving the plates further apart increases \(d\), which decreases capacitance.  
- **F:** Increasing the voltage does not affect capacitance, as \(C\) is independent of \(V\).  
- **G:** A smaller dielectric constant (\(\varepsilon_r\)) reduces \(C\), as \(C\) is directly proportional to \(\varepsilon_r\).  
- **H:** Increasing the distance between the plates increases \(d\), which decreases capacitance.  

The only option that increases capacitance is **D**, as reducing the distance between the plates directly increases \(C\).

**Answer: D**
