Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the belt width for a pulley system. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on belt drives, but I remember some basic concepts.

Alright, the problem gives me a bunch of data. The belt is 1/4 inch thick, operates on a 1-foot pulley rotating at 800 rpm, and delivers 25 horsepower. I need to find the belt width based on several factors: allowable belt stress, angle of contact, coefficient of friction, and specific weight of the belt material.

Wait, let's list out all the given data to organize my thoughts:

- Belt thickness (t) = 1/4 in.
- Pulley diameter (D) = 1 ft = 12 inches. Oh wait, because 1 foot is 12 inches. So radius (r) would be 6 inches.
- Speed (N) = 800 rpm.
- Power (P) = 25 hp.
- Allowable belt stress (σ) = 550 psi.
- Angle of contact (θ) = 160 degrees.
- Coefficient of friction (μ) = 0.45.
- Specific weight (γ) = 0.04 lb/cu-in. Wait, specific weight is usually in lb/ft³, but here it's per cubic inch. Hmm, might relate to calculating the belt's weight.

I remember that power transmitted by a belt is related to the belt tension, speed, and the angle of contact with the pulley. Also, factors like the coefficient of friction and belt stress come into play.

First, maybe I should calculate the belt speed. The belt's linear speed (v) can be found using the formula v = πDN/60. Wait, D is in inches, N is rpm, so let's plug in the numbers.

Wait, D is 12 inches, N is 800 rpm. So v = π * 12 * 800 / 60. Let me compute that.

12 * 800 = 9600. 9600 /60 = 160. So v = π * 160. Approximately 3.1416 * 160 ≈ 502.65 in/min. Oh wait, but wait, power is often in horsepower, which relates to feet per minute. Maybe I should convert this to feet per minute. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, 502.65 in/min is 502.65 /12 ≈ 41.887 ft/min. Wait, no, wait—because 502.65 is in inches per minute. 502.65 inches is 502.65/12 = 41.887 feet per minute. So v ≈ 41.887 ft/min.

Wait, but power is given in horsepower. The formula for power is P = (T * v) / 33000, where T is the tension in pounds, v in ft/min. So rearranging, T = (P * 33000) / v.

So T = (25 hp * 33000) / 41.887 ft/min.

Let me compute that. 25 * 33000 = 825,000. 825000 / 41.887 ≈ 19,700 lb approximately? Wait, that seems high. Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, 41.887 is about 41.887 ft/min, and 33000 is the conversion from horsepower to ft-lbs per minute. So yes, T = (25 * 33000) / 41.887 ≈ (825000) / 41.887 ≈ 19,700 lb. Hmm, that's a lot. Maybe I should think about whether the units are correct or if I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait a second. The formula for power in terms of belt is P = (T1 - T2) * v / 33000, where T1 is the tension on the tight side and T2 on the slack. But in a belt drive, if it's an open belt, the difference in tensions is what matters. But wait, in this problem, perhaps we're considering the average tension or something else, because I'm not given information about the wrap angle or the coefficient of friction in the context of tension difference. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, but the problem gives the angle of contact, which is 160 degrees. Oh right, the angle of contact is the angle that the belt wraps around the pulley. So that relates to the tension ratio between the tight and slack sides. The formula for the ratio of tensions is T1 / T2 = e^(μθ), where μ is the coefficient of friction and θ is in radians.

Wait, θ is given in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians. 160 degrees is (160 * π) / 180 ≈ 2.7925 radians.

So the ratio T1/T2 = e^(0.45 * 2.7925) ≈ e^(1.2586) ≈ 3.513. So T1 = 3.513 * T2.

But without knowing either T1 or T2, how do I proceed? Hmm. Also, I remember that the total tension T (maybe average) is related to the power. Wait, but the power formula I used earlier assumes T is the difference in tensions multiplied by velocity. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me clarify. The power transmitted by a belt is (T1 - T2) * v / 33000 = P.

So P = (T1 - T2) * v / 33000.

We have T1 = 3.513 * T2.

So substituting:

(T1 - T2) = T2 (3.513 -1 ) = 2.513 T2.

So P = (2.513 T2) * v / 33000.

We can solve for T2:

T2 = (P * 33000) / (2.513 * v).

Wait, but earlier I calculated v in ft/min as ≈41.887 ft/min.

So plugging in:

T2 = (25 * 33000) / (2.513 * 41.887).

Let me compute this step by step.

25 *33000 = 825000.

2.513 *41.887 ≈ let's see. 2.5 *42 is 105, so approximate 2.513*41.887≈ 105.2.

So T2≈825000 / 105.2 ≈ 7839 lb.

Then T1=3.513 * 7839 ≈ 27514 lb.

Wait, so T1 is about 27,514 lb, T2 about 7,839 lb.

But that's the tension on each side. But how does that help me find the belt width?

I think the next step involves the allowable belt stress. The maximum stress in the belt is given as 550 psi. Stress is force per unit area. So the maximum tension the belt can handle without failing is the stress multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the belt.

Wait, the belt's cross-sectional area would be thickness (t) multiplied by width (w). So area A = t * w.

So the maximum allowable tension T_max = σ * A = σ * t * w.

But wait, which tension are we considering here? Because the belt is under different tensions on the tight and slack sides. But the maximum tension occurs on the tight side, T1. So we can set T1 = σ * t * w.

Wait, but T1 is 27,514 lb. So:

27,514 lb = 550 psi * (1/4 in) * w.

Wait, let's check units. Psi is pounds per square inch. So 550 psi * (1/4 in * w in) → area in square inches. So 550 * (1/4 * w) → units are lb.

So solving for w:

w = (27,514 lb) / (550 psi * (1/4 in)).

Let me compute that. 550 * (1/4) = 137.5 psi·in.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. 550 psi is 550 lb/sq.in. The area is t*w, where t is 1/4 in and w is in inches, so area is (1/4)*w in².

So T1 = 550 lb/sq.in * (1/4 in) * w in = 550*(w/4) lb.

So solving for w:

w = (T1 *4) /550.

Plug T1 =27,514 lb.

So w = (27514 *4) /550.

Compute numerator: 27514 *4= 110,056.

110056 /550 = let's see. 550 ×200=110,000. So 200 with 56 left. 56/550 ≈0.102. So approximately 200.102 inches. Wait, that can't be right. 200 inches is way too big, and the options are all under 7 inches. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, that can't be. The belt width can't be 200 inches. There's a mistake here somewhere. Let me go back.

Hmm, maybe I mixed up the formula. I think I might have confused the belt's maximum tension with the operating tension. Because the belt can't actually handle T1 as 27,514 lb if the allowable stress is 550 psi and the cross-section is small.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The allowable belt stress is 550 psi. So the maximum tension the belt can handle is the stress multiplied by the cross-sectional area. So T_max = σ * A = σ * t * w.

But in the problem, the belt is operating at T1, which should be less than or equal to T_max.

So T1 = σ * t *w.

Wait, wait, but earlier I calculated T1 as 27,514 lb. So setting that equal to σ*t*w:

27,514 lb = 550 lb/sq.in * (1/4 in) * w in.

So 27,514 = 550 * (1/4) * w.

Let's compute 550*(1/4) = 137.5.

So 27514 = 137.5 * w → w = 27514 / 137.5 ≈ let's calculate that.

27514 ÷ 137.5 ≈ 200.1 inches. That's way too big. The options are much smaller. So I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, another approach: maybe the maximum tension isn't T1, but rather the difference in tensions (T1 - T2) can't exceed the allowable stress multiplied by the area. Or perhaps I'm missing something about how the belt's weight affects the tension.

Wait, another factor is the specific weight of the belt material. Oh right, the belt has weight, which contributes to the tension. The specific weight is given as 0.04 lb/cu-in. So the belt's weight per unit length would be specific weight multiplied by cross-sectional area.

Wait, specific weight (γ) is 0.04 lb/cu-in. So the weight per unit length (w') is γ * area. Area is t * w. So w' = 0.04 lb/cu-in * t * w in² → units would be lb/in.

Wait, that's the weight per inch of belt. So the total weight of the belt would depend on the length, but perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, maybe the belt's weight causes an additional tension. I remember that for belts, the weight can create tension, especially in longer belts. But I'm not sure how to incorporate that into this problem.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach neglects the belt's weight. Let me think: In the standard belt drive equations, the weight of the belt can induce tension, but when the belt is running, the weight contributes to the tension. So the tensions T1 and T2 are related to both the power and the belt's weight.

Wait, there's a formula that considers the belt's weight. The difference in tensions is due to both the power transmitted and the weight. Hmm, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for power considering the belt's weight. The power P is given by P = (T1 - T2) v / 33000, but T1 and T2 are affected by the belt's weight. The belt's weight causes an additional tension, so the effective difference might be less.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, another formula I remember is that the power transmitted by a belt is also given by P = (σ * w * t * v * sin(θ/2)) / 33000. Wait, not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps considering the angle of contact.

Wait, maybe the torque transmitted is related to the belt tensions. Torque T = (T1 - T2) * r, where r is the pulley radius.

But I also know that power P = Torque * angular speed (in consistent units). So P = T * ω, where ω is in radians per minute.

Wait, let's compute torque first. Torque T = (T1 - T2) * r. The radius r is 6 inches, which is 0.5 feet.

Wait, but the unit conversion might be tricky here. Let me think.

Power P is given as 25 hp. Converting that to ft-lbs per minute: 1 hp = 33000 ft-lbs per minute. So P =25 *33000 = 825000 ft-lb/min.

Angular speed ω is 800 rpm, which is 800 * 2π radians per minute. So ω = 1600π ≈ 5026.548 rad/min.

So, torque τ = P / ω = 825000 / 5026.548 ≈ 164.07 ft-lb.

But torque is also (T1 - T2) * r. Since r is 6 inches (0.5 ft), so:

τ = (T1 - T2) * 0.5 ft.

So 164.07 = (T1 - T2)*0.5 → T1 - T2 = 328.14 lb.

Earlier, from the power formula, I had T1 - T2 = 2.513 * T2 = 328.14 lb.

Wait, so 2.513 T2 = 328.14 → T2 ≈ 130.6 lb. Then T1 = 328.14 +130.6 ≈ 458.74 lb.

Wait, that's a much smaller number than before. So maybe I messed up earlier when calculating T1 and T2.

Wait, so perhaps the problem is that I didn't convert units correctly earlier. Let me try again.

Wait, earlier when I computed v as 502.65 in/min, which is 502.65 inches per minute. But to convert to ft/min, it's 502.65 /12 ≈41.887 ft/min.

Then power P =25 hp = 25 *33000 = 825000 ft-lb/min.

So P = (T1 - T2) * v / 33000 → 825000 = (T1 - T2) * 41.887 / 33000.

Wait, no, the formula is P = (T1 - T2) * v / 33000. So 25 hp = (T1-T2) * 41.887 ft/min / 33000.

So (T1-T2) = 25 * 33000 /41.887 ≈ (825000)/41.887 ≈19,700 lb. Wait, that can't be right, because earlier when considering torque, I got T1-T2=328 lb.

Hmm, there's a contradiction here. So I must have made a mistake in one of these approaches.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from the two different methods. Let me clarify:

Method 1: Using power formula P = (T1-T2) * v / 33000 → T1-T2 = (P *33000)/v.

Method 2: Using torque τ = (T1-T2)*r and τ = P/ω.

These should give the same result. Let me compute both.

Using Method 1:

v = π D N /60 → D=12 in, N=800 rpm.

v = π *12 *800 /60 = (3.1416 *12 *800)/60 → (3.1416 *9600)/60 → 3.1416 * 160 ≈502.65 in/min.

Convert to ft/min: 502.65 /12 =41.887 ft/min.

So T1-T2 = (25 *33000) /41.887 → 825000 /41.887≈19,700 lb.

Using Method 2:

Torque τ = P/ω.

P=25 hp =25*33000=825000 ft-lb/min.

Angular speed ω =800 rpm * 2π rad/rev =1600π rad/min ≈5026.548 rad/min.

τ=825000/5026.548≈164.07 ft-lb.

Torque is also (T1-T2)*r, where r is the radius in feet.

r=6 in =0.5 ft.

So (T1-T2) = τ / r =164.07 /0.5 =328.14 lb.

Wait, so now I have two different values for T1-T2: 19,700 lb from Method 1 and 328 lb from Method 2. That's impossible. So I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Ah! I see the mistake. In Method 1, when I used v in ft/min, the correct formula should have T1-T2 in lb, v in ft/min, and P in hp. Let me re-examine the correct formula.

The correct formula is P (hp) = (T1 - T2) (lb) * v (ft/min) / 33000.

So rearranged, T1-T2 = (P * 33000) / v.

So with P=25, v=41.887 ft/min.

So T1-T2=25 *33000 /41.887≈ 825000 /41.887≈19,700 lb.

But in Method 2, using torque and angular velocity, I get T1-T2=328 lb.

This discrepancy suggests I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I confused angular velocity units. Let me double-check Method 2.

Torque in ft-lbs, angular velocity in radians per minute.

Power P = τ * ω → τ= P/ω.

But P must be in consistent units. Wait, 1 hp = 33000 ft-lb per minute, so P=25 hp=25*33000 ft-lb/min.

Angular velocity ω is 800 rpm =800 *2π rad/min=1600π rad/min≈5026.548 rad/min.

So τ=825000 /5026.548�
