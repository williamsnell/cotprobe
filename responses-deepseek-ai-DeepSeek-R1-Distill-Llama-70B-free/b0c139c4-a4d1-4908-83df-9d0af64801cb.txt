Okay, so I've got this question about an electret sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. So an electret is like a material that has a permanent electric dipole moment, right? And it's in the absence of free charges. So the question gives me an electret sphere of radius R, and the polarization vector P is given as r̂ P0 r. Wait, wait, no, actually, looking again, it's P = r̂ P0 r. Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Oh wait, maybe it's P = (r̂) P0 r? Or perhaps P = P0 multiplied by the radial unit vector times r? Hmm, maybe it's P = P0 r̂, which would mean it's radial and varies with r. Wait, perhaps it's P(r) = P0 r̂, but that would be a constant magnitude, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's P equals r̂ times P0 times r, so P = P0 r r̂. That would make it proportional to r.

Wait, but thinking about the problem, since it's a sphere, the polarization is probably uniform in direction (radial) but perhaps increases with r. Or maybe it's uniform in magnitude. Wait, no, the question says P is r̂ P0 r. So P points radially outward, and its magnitude is P0 multiplied by r. So P(r) = P0 r r̂. That seems a bit unusual, but okay, let's go with that.

The question asks for three things: the bound charge density rho', the electric displacement vector D, and the electric field E as functions of r. So I need to find these for regions inside the sphere (r < R) and outside (r > R).

I remember that bound charges in a material are given by the divergence of the polarization. The bound charge density rho_b is given by -div(P) + any surface charge, but since there's no free charge, I think we can ignore surface charges for now. Wait, no, the bound charges are volume and surface. So rho' (I think that's the bound charge density) is -div(P) for the volume charge, and sigma' is P dot n for the surface charge.

So first, let's compute rho' = -div(P). Since P is a vector field, we need to compute its divergence.

In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field P which is radial and depends only on r is given by (1/r²) d/dr (r² P_r). So since P = P0 r r̂, which means P_r = P0 r. So the divergence would be (1/r²) d/dr (r² * P0 r) = (1/r²) d/dr (P0 r^3) = (1/r²)(3 P0 r²) )= 3 P0.

Wait, no. Wait, let me recheck. P is P0 r r̂, so P_r = P0 r. So the divergence is (1/r²) * d/dr (r² P_r) ) = (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * P0 r) = (1/r²) d/dr (P0 r^3) ) = (1/r²) * 3 P0 r^2 = 3 P0. So rho' = -div(P) = -3 P0.

Wait, but wait. Is that correct? Because if P is proportional to r, then the divergence is positive 3 P0, so rho' would be -3 P0? Hmm, that's option D, E, I, J mention rho' as -3 P0 or similar.

Wait, but let's think again. Wait, rho' is the bound charge density, which is rho_b = -div(P). So if div(P) is 3 P0, then rho_b is -3 P0. So that would be negative three P0. So looking at the options, options D and E have rho' = -3 P0. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option D: rho' = -3P0, D=0, E = -(P0 r)/(epsilon_0) for r > R, and E=0 inside.

Option E: rho' = -3P0, D=0, E=-(P0 r/epsilon_0) for r < R, and E=0 outside.

Hmm, but wait, that can't be right. Because in a uniformly polarized sphere, the field inside is uniform, but this case isn't uniform polarization. Because here, P is varying with r as P = P0 r r̂. So maybe the approach is different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the divergence calculation. Let me go through it again. P(r) = P0 r r̂, so P_r = P0 r, and the other components are zero. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a radial vector field is (1/r²) d/dr (r² P_r). So d/dr (r² * P_r) = d/dr (r² * P0 r) = d/dr (P0 r^3) = 3 P0 r^2. So (1/r²) * 3 P0 r² = 3 P0. So div P is 3 P0. Therefore, rho' = -3 P0. So the volume charge is negative 3 P0.

Wait, but wait a second, what about the surface charge? The surface charge sigma' would be P · n, where n is the normal vector at the surface. So at r = R, sigma' = P(R) · r̂ = P0 R. So there's a positive surface charge on the sphere.

So inside the sphere, we have a volume charge rho' = -3 P0, and a surface charge sigma' = P0 R.

Now, to find the electric displacement D. I remember that D is related to the free charges, but here there are no free charges, so I think D would satisfy div D = rho_free. Since rho_free is zero, div D = 0. But D is also related to E via D = epsilon_0 E + P. So D = epsilon_0 E + P.

Wait, but let me think again. Since there are no free charges, the displacement field D satisfies div D = 0. So in regions where there's no free charge, D can be found using this condition.

For the region inside the sphere (r < R), since rho' is the bound charge, but wait, no. Wait, the bound charges are not free charges. So the free charge density rho_free is zero. Therefore, div D = rho_free = 0. So D must be such that its divergence is zero.

Now, let's model D. Since the problem is spherically symmetric, D should be radial and depend only on r. So D(r) = D_r(r) r̂.

From D = epsilon_0 E + P, so E = (D - P)/epsilon_0.

But I also know that the electric field E can be found using Gauss's law, considering the bound charges. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find E first, then compute D.

Wait, but maybe we should find D first. Since div D = 0, the divergence of D is (1/r²) d/dr (r² D_r) ) = 0. So integrating, r² D_r must be a constant. Let's call this constant k.

So for r < R, D_r(r) = k / r². What is k? Well, perhaps determined by boundary conditions. Alternatively, perhaps we can find D from the relation D = epsilon_0 E + P, and E can be determined from the bound charges.

Wait, but another approach: the electric field E is related to the bound charges. The bound charges consist of the volume charge rho' = -3 P0 and the surface charge sigma' = P0 R.

So to find E inside the sphere (r < R), perhaps we can use Gauss's law for the bound charges.

Wait, no, because E is due to all charges, both bound and free. But in this case, there are no free charges, so E is due to the bound charges only.

So using Gauss's law: the integral of E · dA over a surface is equal to the enclosed charge divided by epsilon_0.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, Gauss's law in terms of E is ∮ E · dA = Q_enc / epsilon_0.

For a sphere of radius r < R, the enclosed charge Q_enc is the integral of rho' over the volume inside r: Q_enc = integral (rho') dV = integral (-3 P0) * 4 pi r'^2 dr' from 0 to r.

So Q_enc = -3 P0 * 4 pi ∫ (from 0 to r) r'^2 dr' = -3 P0 * 4 pi [ r'^3 /3 ] from 0 to r ) = -3 P0 * 4 pi (r³/3) ) = -4 pi P0 r³.

So the flux is E * 4 pi r² = ( -4 pi P0 r³ ) / epsilon_0.

So E = ( -4 pi P0 r³ ) / (epsilon_0 * 4 pi r² ) ) = (- P0 r ) / epsilon_0.

Wait, but that gives E as negative. Since the field is radial, and the charge is negative inside, the field should point inward, so negative, which matches.

So inside the sphere, E = - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂.

Then, from D = epsilon_0 E + P, since P = P0 r r̂, substituting:

D = epsilon_0 [ - (P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂ ] + P0 r r̂ = - P0 r r̂ + P0 r r̂ = 0.

So D is zero inside the sphere.

Hmm, but wait, that's unexpected. So D is zero inside the sphere.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. E is - (P0 r/epsilon_0) r̂. Then D = epsilon_0 E + P.

So substituting, D = epsilon_0 * (- P0 r / epsilon_0) r̂ + P0 r r̂ = (- P0 r + P0 r) r̂ = 0. So yes, D is zero inside the sphere.

What about outside the sphere, r > R?

In that region, the bound charges are zero because P is only present inside the sphere. So for r > R, P = 0.

So D must satisfy div D = 0. So again, D must be of the form D = (k / r²) r̂.

What is the value of k? Well, we can find it by considering the continuity of D across the surface at r = R. Wait, but wait, D has a discontinuity in its normal component equal to the free surface charge. But in this problem, there are no free charges, so D should be continuous across the surface.

Wait, the free surface charge is sigma_free = 0. So the normal component of D must be continuous across the surface. Let's compute D just inside and just outside at r = R.

Inside, D is zero. Outside, D at r=R must be D_out(R) = (k / R²) r̂.

But at the surface, the bound surface charge is sigma' = P · n = P0 R * r̂ · r̂ = P0 R. So sigma' is a bound surface charge. But for D, the discontinuity is given by sigma_free. Since there's no free charge, the discontinuity is zero. So the normal component of D just outside minus the normal component just inside is zero.

So D_out(R) r̂ · r̂ = D_in(R) r̂ · r̂. But D_in is zero, so D_out(R) r̂ · r̂ = 0? But that can't be right because the bound charges contribute to the field.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing things. Let's think again. The relation for the discontinuity in D is that the jump in the normal component is equal to the free surface charge sigma_free. Since there's no free charge, sigma_free is zero. So D_out(R) - D_in(R) = 0. But D_in(R) is zero, so D_out(R) must be zero as well. But that would imply that D is zero everywhere outside as well, which can't be right because there's a surface charge that would create a field.

Wait, no, because the bound surface charge sigma' = P · n = P0 R. So that's a bound charge, not a free charge. So the field outside would be due to this bound surface charge.

Wait, but the bound surface charge is sigma' = P · n = P0 R. So the total bound charge on the sphere is sigma' * 4 pi R² = 4 pi R² * P0 R = 4 pi P0 R^3. But wait, that seems like a volume charge, but it's actually a surface charge. Wait, no, the total bound charge would be integral over the surface: 4 pi R^2 * sigma' = 4 pi R^2 * P0 R = 4 pi P0 R^3. But wait, that can't be right because the volume charge inside is rho' = -3 P0, so the total bound charge is integral of rho' dV + integral of sigma' dA.

Wait, the total bound charge should be zero because the surface is positive and the volume is negative. Let me compute that. Volume charge: integral of -3 P0 over the sphere is -3 P0 * (4/3 pi R^3) )= -4 pi P0 R^3. Surface charge: 4 pi R^2 * P0 R = 4 pi P0 R^3. So total bound charge is (-4 pi P0 R^3) + (4 pi P0 R^3) )= 0. So the net charge is zero, which makes sense because the electret has no net charge, just dipolar charge distribution.

So outside the sphere, the field should look like that of a dipole, but wait, no, because the net charge is zero, so the field at large distances would fall off like 1/r^3, but since it's a sphere, maybe it's like a dipole outside. Wait, but wait, no, because the surface charge is positive and the volume is negative, but the net charge is zero, so the field outside would be like that of a dipole.

Wait, but let me compute E outside using Gauss's law. For r > R, the Gaussian surface encloses all the bound charges. The total bound charge is zero, as we saw. But wait, that can't be right because when you have a dipolar charge distribution, the field outside is dipolar, but the monopole term (total charge) is zero. So the field would decrease as 1/r^3.

Wait, but alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute E outside by considering the bound charges. So E outside would be the field due to the bound surface charge and the volume charge. Since the net charge is zero, the monopole contribution is zero, so the field would be that of a dipole.

But perhaps a simpler way is to use the fact that for r > R, the field is similar to that of a dipole with dipole moment p.

The dipole moment of the sphere is given by p = (1/3) P R^3. Wait, no, wait, the dipole moment p is the integral over the polarization: p = ∫ P dV.

Since P = P0 r r̂, the integral becomes p = ∫ (P0 r r̂) r² sinθ dr dθ dφ.

But since P is radial, the integral simplifies. The only component of p would be in the radial direction, but when integrated over the sphere, the components in other directions cancel due to symmetry. So p would be along, say, the z-axis, but for a sphere, the integral of r̂ over the sphere is zero. Wait, no, because r̂ varies with direction. Wait, this can't be right. Because P is pointing radially outward, the dipole moment would be the sum of all the dipoles pointing outward, but that's not a dipole but a monopole-like distribution because every point is outward.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting complicated. Let me instead think about the field outside the sphere.

Since the net charge is zero, the field outside must be that of a dipole. So the potential would be dipolar, varying as 1/r^2, and the field as 1/r^3.

But wait, let me think again. For a sphere with a uniform polarization, the field inside is uniform, and outside it's like a dipole. But in this case, the polarization isn't uniform; it's increasing with r.

Wait, but in this problem, since D is zero inside, perhaps D outside is non-zero, but let's compute it.

Wait, for r > R, the region outside the sphere, the bound charges are zero, so P = 0. So D must satisfy div D = 0. So as before, D = (k / r²) r̂.

Now, the value of k can be found by considering the boundary conditions at r = R.

The electric displacement D has a discontinuity in its normal component equal to the free surface charge sigma_free. But since sigma_free is zero, the normal component of D is continuous across r = R.

Inside, D is zero. So just outside, D_r(R) must be zero. So D outside is zero? That can't be right because then E would be zero outside, which would imply no field, but we have bound charges that would produce a field.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe using E instead would be better.

Wait, inside the sphere, E is -(P0 r/epsilon_0) r̂. Then, D = epsilon_0 E + P = epsilon_0 (-P0 r/epsilon_0) r̂ + P0 r r̂ = 0, as before.

Outside, P = 0, so D = epsilon_0 E. Also, div D = 0, so D must be of the form D = (k / r²) r̂.

At the surface r = R, the normal component of D must be continuous, so D_out(R) = D_in(R) = 0. So k / R² = 0 ⇒ k = 0. So D is zero everywhere outside as well. But that can't be right because then E would be zero outside, which doesn't make sense because the bound charges should produce a field.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the surface charge contributes to the field. Since at r = R, the surface has a bound charge sigma' = P0 R, that would create a discontinuity in E. The electric field has
