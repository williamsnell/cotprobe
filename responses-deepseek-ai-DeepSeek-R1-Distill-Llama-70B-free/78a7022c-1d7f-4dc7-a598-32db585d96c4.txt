Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about freezing point depression. Hmm, I remember that when you dissolve a solute in a solvent, the freezing point of the solution decreases. The formula for freezing point depression is ΔTf = Kf * m, where ΔTf is the change in freezing point, Kf is the freezing point constant, and m is the molality of the solution.

Wait, right, the problem gives me some numbers. The freezing point constant (Kf) of toluene is 3.33°C per mole per 1000g. Oh wait, no, per mole per kilogram, since 1000g is a kilogram. So Kf is 3.33°C·kg/mol.

The problem says I'm dissolving 0.4 moles of solute in 500g of toluene. Oh wait, because molality is moles per kilogram. So 500g is 0.5 kg. So the molality m would be moles divided by kg. So m = 0.4 mol / 0.5 kg. That's 0.8 m. Wait, 0.4 divided by 0.5 is 0.8, right? So m is 0.8 mol/kg.

So then ΔTf is Kf multiplied by m. So 3.33 * 0.8. Let me calculate that. 3.33 times 0.8 is... 3.33 * 0.8. 3 times 0.8 is 2.4, 0.33 *0.8 is 0.264, so total is 2.4 +0.264 = 2.664°C. So the change in freezing point is +2.664°C, but wait, freezing point depression is a lowering of the freezing point, which would make the solution freeze at a lower temperature. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is ΔTf = Kf * m, but the freezing point depression is the change, which is the original freezing point minus the solution freezing point. Or wait, the formula is solution freezing point = pure solvent freezing point + ΔTf? No, wait, no, the freezing point decreases, so the solution's freezing point is lower. So the equation is T_f solution = T_f pure solvent - ΔTf.

Wait, wait, no, the freezing point depression is the amount the freezing point has decreased. So the formula is actually ΔTf = T_pure - T_solution. So the solution's freezing point is lower than the pure solvent's. So to find the new freezing point, T_solution = T_pure - ΔTf.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The freezing point of the pure solvent is given as -95.0°C. When you add a solute, the freezing point decreases (gets more negative, further from zero). So the solution will freeze at a lower temperature than the pure solvent. So the freezing point is lower, meaning more negative. So T_solution = T_pure - ΔTf.

Wait, no, wait. Because ΔTf is the change, which is the amount the freezing point has been depressed. So if the pure solvent freezes at, say, T0, then the solution will freeze at T0 - ΔTf. But wait, if T0 is -95, and ΔTf is positive, say 2.664, then T_solution would be -95 - 2.664 = -97.664°C, which is more negative. So that would be the case.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Because sometimes I get confused with the signs. So the formula for freezing point depression is ΔTf = Kf * m. And the solution's freezing point is lower (more negative) than the pure solvent's. So yes, T_solution = T_pure - ΔTf.

So in this case, T_pure is -95.0°C. So the solution's freezing point is -95.0 - 2.664. Let me compute that. 95 plus 2.664 is 97.664, so with negative signs, it's -97.664°C, which I can round to maybe -97.66°C.

Looking at the options, option E is -97.66°C and option H is -98.34°C. Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate the molality. We have 0.4 moles in 500g, which is 0.5 kg. So 0.4 / 0.5 is 0.8 mol/kg. Correct. Then ΔTf is 3.33 * 0.8. Let's compute that again: 3.33 * 0.8.

3.33 * 0.8:

3 * 0.8 is 2.4.

0.33 * 0.8 is 0.264.

So 2.4 + 0.264 = 2.664. So yes, correct.

So T_solution = -95.0 - 2.664 = -97.664°C. So approximately -97.66°C. Let me look at the options again.

Option E is -97.66°C. So the correct answer would be E. But wait, let me check if any of the other options match that. Hmm.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh wait, is toluene's freezing point given correctly? The question says the freezing point of toluene is -95.0°C. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, some sources say the freezing point of toluene is around -93°C, but in the problem, it's given as -95.0°C, so I have to go by that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, 0.4 moles in 500g (0.5 kg) gives 0.8 m. Correct.

Kf is 3.33°C·kg/mol. So 3.33 * 0.8 = 2.664. So the change is +2.664, but the solution's freezing point is lower by that amount. So T_solution = -95.0 - 2.664 = -97.664, which is -97.66°C when rounded to two decimal places.

Looking at the options, option E is -97.66°C, which matches exactly. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me look again. Oh, wait, the options are:

A: -92.34°C

B: -89.66°C

C: -88.0°C

D: -90.0°C

E: -97.66°C

F: -100.0°C

G: -93.0°C

H: -98.34°C

I: -94.0°C

J: -96.0°C

So E is correct. So the correct answer is E.

To calculate the freezing point of the solution, we use the formula for freezing point depression:

\[
\Delta T_f = K_f \cdot m
\]

where:
- \( \Delta T_f \) is the change in freezing point,
- \( K_f \) is the freezing point constant of toluene (\( 3.33 \, \text{°C·kg/mol} \)),
- \( m \) is the molality of the solution.

### Step 1: Calculate molality (\( m \))
Molality is defined as:

\[
m = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kilograms of solvent}}
\]

Given:
- Moles of solute = \( 0.4 \, \text{mol} \),
- Mass of solvent = \( 500 \, \text{g} = 0.5 \, \text{kg} \),

\[
m = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \, \text{mol/kg}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \Delta T_f \)
Using the formula \( \Delta T_f = K_f \cdot m \):

\[
\Delta T_f = 3.33 \cdot 0.8 = 2.664 \, \text{°C}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the new freezing point
The freezing point of the solution is given by:

\[
T_{\text{solution}} = T_{\text{pure}} - \Delta T_f
\]

Given:
- Freezing point of pure toluene (\( T_{\text{pure}} \)) = \( -95.0 \, \text{°C} \),

\[
T_{\text{solution}} = -95.0 - 2.664 = -97.664 \, \text{°C}
\]

Rounding to two decimal places:

\[
T_{\text{solution}} = -97.66 \, \text{°C}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option to \( -97.66 \, \text{°C} \) is **E: -97.66°C**.
