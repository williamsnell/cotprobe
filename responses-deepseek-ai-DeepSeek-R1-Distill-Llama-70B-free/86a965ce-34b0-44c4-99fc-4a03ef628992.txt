Okay, so I've got this legal question here about property ownership and deeds. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my property law, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the question says that a wife and husband own a dairy as tenants by the entirety. I remember that tenancy by the entirety is a type of co-ownership that's only available to a married couple. It's different from joint tenancy or tenancy in common. The key features, if I recall correctly, are the right of survivorship and the fact that neither spouse can transfer their interest without the other's consent.

So the scenario is that the wife transfers her interest via a quitclaim deed to her aunt without the husband's knowledge. The question is, what interest does the aunt get, if any?

First, let me think about what a quitclaim deed does. From what I remember, a quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the grantor has at the time. It doesn't guarantee that the grantor actually has good title or any interest at all. So if the wife doesn't have the right to transfer her interest, then the aunt might not get anything.

Wait, but in tenancy by the entirety, each spouse owns an undivided half interest, but they can't transfer it without the other's consent. So if the wife tries to transfer her half, does that work? I think in this case, the wife can't convey a valid interest because she doesn't own the property as an individual; it's held by the entirety. So the deed she gives would be ineffective.

Another point is that in tenancy by the entirety, both spouses have to act together to transfer the property. If one tries to do it alone, it doesn't affect the other's interest. So the husband still holds his interest, and the wife's attempt to transfer doesn't change anything.

So the aunt, in this case, probably doesn't get any interest. The quitclaim deed from the wife wouldn't convey anything because the wife doesn't have the authority to transfer her interest without her husband's consent.

Looking at the options:

A: Temporary leasehold - No, because it's about ownership, not a lease.

B: Undivided 1/2 with survivorship - That would be if she had a joint tenancy, but in tenancy by entirety, each can't transfer separately.

C: 1/3 interest - Doesn't make sense here.

D: Right to inhabit - Maybe if it were a life estate, but that's not the case.

E: 1/2 without survivorship - Again, she can't transfer her half alone.

F: Life estate - No, the deed isn't for a life estate.

G: Claim to profits - Maybe if she had an interest, but since she doesn't, the aunt can't claim profits.

H: No interest - That seems right because the wife couldn't convey anything.

I: Lien - No, a lien is a claim against the property, not an ownership interest.

J: Full ownership - No, the wife can't transfer full ownership.

So the answer must be H: No interest.

In a tenancy by the entirety, a married couple holds title to property as a single legal entity, with each spouse owning an undivided half interest. A key characteristic of this form of ownership is that neither spouse can transfer their interest without the consent of the other. The wife's attempt to transfer her interest via a quitclaim deed without her husband's knowledge or consent is therefore ineffective. A quitclaim deed only transfers the interest the grantor has at the time, and since the wife cannot unilaterally transfer her interest in a tenancy by the entirety, the aunt acquires no interest in the property.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, E, F, G, I, J**: These options all assume the aunt acquires some form of interest, which is incorrect because the wife's transfer is invalid under tenancy by the entirety.
- **D**: The right to inhabit is not relevant here, as the question pertains to ownership, not occupancy rights.
- **H**: This is correct because the aunt receives no interest due to the invalidity of the wife's transfer.

Thus, the aunt has no interest in the property.

Answer: H
