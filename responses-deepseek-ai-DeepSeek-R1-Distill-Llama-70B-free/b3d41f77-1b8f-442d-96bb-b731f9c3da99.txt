Okay, so I have this question about Butler's view on acting virtuously. I'm a bit rusty on philosophy, but I'll try to think it through. 

Butler was a Bishop and a philosopher, right? I remember he wrote about ethics, particularly in his "Fifteen Sermons." His ideas were a response to Hobbes, I think. Hobbes believed that humans are primarily self-interested, but Butler argued that humans have more than just self-love; we have other principles like benevolence.

Wait, so Butler talked about different principles or springs of action in human nature. These include self-love, benevolence, and conscience. He believed that these are all part of our nature, but they have a hierarchy. 

Self-love is often misunderstood as selfishness, but Butler saw it as a rational, long-term interest. Benevolence is the desire for the happiness of others. Then there's conscience, which is our moral faculty that approves or disapproves of actions.

So, the question is about what acting virtuously consists of according to Butler. The options are various principles. Let me go through them.

Option A: all of our inward principles. That doesn't sound right because if we act according to all, there might be conflicts. Butler probably didn't mean that.

Option B: our highest inward principle. That sounds more plausible. I think Butler believed that conscience is the highest principle, so acting according to it would be virtuous.

Option C: principles dictated by law. I don't recall Butler focusing on external laws as the basis for virtue. It was more about internal principles.

Option D: commands of God. While Butler was a theologian, I'm not sure if he said virtue comes directly from God's commands or from the principles He implanted in us. Maybe more about the latter.

Option E: principles of our elders. No, that's more like traditional or cultural norms, not Butler's view.

Option F: principles of society. Similar to E, more societal norms rather than internal principles.

Option G: weakest inward principle. That doesn't make sense because virtue would be about the stronger, guiding principle.

Option H: strongest inward principle. Well, if the strongest is self-love, then that's not necessarily virtuous. So maybe not H.

Option I: principles of our peers. Again, that's external influence, not internal.

Wait, back to Butler's hierarchy. He said that self-love and benevolence are both legitimate, but when they conflict, conscience should guide. So the highest principle is conscience. So acting virtuously would be acting in accordance with our highest inward principle, which is conscience.

So the correct answer should be B. Let me double-check. Yes, because Butler's ethical system emphasizes the role of conscience as the supreme principle that should govern our actions when other principles like self-love and benevolence conflict.

In Butler’s view, acting virtuously involves adhering to the highest inward principle, which he identifies as conscience. This principle serves as the moral faculty that guides actions and resolves conflicts between other principles like self-love and benevolence. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: our highest inward principle.

Answer: B
