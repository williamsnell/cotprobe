Question:

Suppose that your utility bill for July states that you used 328 kw-hrs of electricity and 1400 cu. ft. of natural gas. There is a flat rate of $1.70 for the first 15 kw-hours. Different rates are set for daytime, evening and late-evening to 8 A.M. You used 45 hours at .043 per hour, 140 hours at $.0318 per hour, and 128 hours at .0179 per hour. The charges for gas are: 600 cu. ft. ($3.20 flat charge) plus 800 cu. ft. at $.253 per 100 cu. ft. Your phone bill, subject to a 10% federal tax, has a basic charge of $6.27, plus long distance calls at $1.36 and $3.45. Electric, gas, and phone bills are subject to a 6% city tax. What is the total amount of each bill?

Options:

A: Electric bill: $9.45, Gas bill: $7.68, Phone bill: $13.50
B: Electric bill: $8.79, Gas bill: $6.02, Phone bill: $10.94
C: Electric bill: $10.25, Gas bill: $7.50, Phone bill: $10.00
D: Electric bill: $15.00, Gas bill: $8.10, Phone bill: $14.22
E: Electric bill: $13.20, Gas bill: $4.87, Phone bill: $9.68
F: Electric bill: $5.22, Gas bill: $11.00, Phone bill: $10.38
G: Electric bill: $12.86, Gas bill: $6.27, Phone bill: $5.53
H: Electric bill: $10.38, Gas bill: $5.22, Phone bill: $11.00
I: Electric bill: $11.00, Gas bill: $5.53, Phone bill: $12.86
J: Electric bill: $6.87, Gas bill: $9.35, Phone bill: $11.76

Okay, so I have this question about calculating utility bills, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these calculations, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me three different bills: electric, gas, and phone. Each has its own way of being calculated, and then there's a city tax applied to all of them. Plus, the phone bill has a federal tax. The options are A through J, each giving different totals for each bill. I need to calculate each bill correctly and see which option matches.

Let's start with the electric bill. The usage is 328 kw-hrs. But wait, the rates are based on time of use. So there's a flat rate for the first 15 kw-hours, which is $1.70. Then there are different rates for different time periods: daytime, evening, and late evening.

Wait, the usage hours are broken down into:
- 45 hours at $0.043 per hour,
- 140 hours at $0.0318 per hour,
- 128 hours at $0.0179 per hour.

Hmm, but wait, the total kw-hrs used is 328. Let me check if the sum of these hours' usage equals 328.

Wait, no. Wait a minute, no. Oh, wait, no. The way the question is written might be confusing. The usage is 328 kw-hrs, but the hours are the number of hours the electricity was used in different time brackets, right? Or wait, maybe not. Because the way it's described, the first 15 kw-hrs have a flat rate, but then the rest might be charged at different rates based on when they were used.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the question again. 

"Flat rate of $1.70 for the first 15 kw-hours. Different rates set for daytime, evening, and late-evening to 8 A.M. You used 45 hours at .043 per hour, 140 hours at $.0318 per hour, and 128 hours at .0179 per hour."

Wait, no, perhaps the total electricity used is 328 kw-hrs, but the hours are the number of hours the meter was in each rate category. Or maybe the 45,140,128 hours are the number of hours in each usage period, but that doesn't directly translate to kw-hrs. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the electricity is billed with time-of-use rates. So the first 15 kw-hrs are charged at a flat rate of $1.70. Then, the remaining usage (328 - 15 = 313 kw-hrs) are charged based on when they were used.

Wait, but the given hours are 45, 140, and 128. Let me sum those: 45 + 140 + 128 = 313 hours. Oh, that's the same as the remaining after the first 15 kw-hrs. So each hour in these periods contributes a certain amount to the total kw-hrs. Wait, no, that can't be right because 313 hours times some rate per hour would give more than 313 kw-hrs. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the way it's structured is that you have 45 hours of usage during the day, 140 during evening, and 128 during late-evening. But each hour of usage in each period would consume a certain amount of energy, but that's not how it's presented. Or perhaps the rates are per kw-hr, and the hours are the number of hours in each period.

Wait, perhaps the rates are per kw-hr, and the 45, 140, 128 are the number of hours in each time bracket. But that doesn't make sense because the rates are per kw-hr. Alternatively, perhaps the 45, 140, 128 are the number of kw-hrs used in each period. Wait, no, the way it's written is "used X hours at Y per hour," which is a bit ambiguous. Wait, maybe it's that for each hour in the period, you consume some amount of energy, but that's not how billing usually works. Alternatively, maybe the 45 hours are the number of hours, and the rate is per hour in that period. So, for the 45 hours in the day, you pay 0.043 per hour, but what's the unit here? It must be dollars per kw-hr, so the cost would be 45 * 0.043 dollars, but wait, that would give a very small amount.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 hours are the number of kw-hrs used during the day, and each of those is charged at 0.043 dollars per kw-hr. So 45 * 0.043, plus 140 * 0.0318, plus 128 * 0.0179, plus the flat rate. That might make sense.

Wait, but the first 15 kw-hrs are at a flat rate of $1.70, and the remaining 313 are split into these three time periods. So the total electric cost would be the flat rate plus the sum of each time period's usage times their respective rate.

So electric_bill = 1.70 + (45 * 0.043) + (140 * 0.0318) + (128 * 0.0179)

Let me compute each part:

45 * 0.043 = 1.935
140 * 0.0318 = 4.452
128 * 0.0179 ≈ 2.2912
Adding these together: 1.935 + 4.452 = 6.387; 6.387 + 2.2912 ≈ 8.6782
Then add the flat rate: 8.6782 + 1.70 = 10.3782

Then, I need to apply the 6% city tax on this amount. So 10.3782 * 1.06 = ?

Let me compute that:

10.3782 * 0.06 = 0.622692
So total electric: 10.3782 + 0.622692 ≈ 11.000892, which is approximately $11.00.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have electric bills like $10.25, $9.45, etc. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps the time of use rates are based on hours, not kw-hrs? Let me think again. The question says "used 45 hours at .043 per hour" etc. So if it's per hour, then 45 hours * $0.043 per hour would be 45 * 0.043 = $1.935. Similarly for the others.

Wait, but that would mean that the total from the time-based rates is 1.935 + 4.452 + 2.2912 = approximately 8.678, plus the flat rate 1.70, making 10.378 before tax. Then adding 6% tax gives about 11.00. So that would make the electric bill about $11.00.

Wait, looking at the options, option I has electric bill $11.00, gas $5.53, phone $12.86. Option J has electric $6.87, etc.

Wait, but let me proceed to calculate gas and phone to see which option matches.

Next, the gas bill. The charges are 600 cu. ft. with a flat charge of $3.20, plus 800 cu. ft. at $0.253 per 100 cu. ft.

Wait, the total gas used is 1400 cu. ft. So the first 600 is flat $3.20, and the remaining 800 is charged at $0.253 per 100 cu. ft.

So the 800 cu. ft. would be 8 times 100, so 8 * 0.253 = $2.024.

So total gas cost before tax: 3.20 + 2.024 = $5.224.

Then apply 6% city tax: 5.224 * 1.06 = ?

5.224 * 0.06 = 0.31344
So total gas bill: 5.224 + 0.31344 ≈ 5.53744, which is about $5.54.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have gas bills as $5.53, $5.22, etc.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Gas: 600 cu.ft: $3.20
Next 800 cu.ft: (800 / 100) * 0.253 = 8 * 0.253 = 2.024
Total before tax: 3.20 + 2.024 = 5.224
Tax: 5.224 * 0.06 = 0.31344
Total gas: 5.224 + 0.31344 = 5.53744, which is approximately $5.54.

Hmm, but in the options, the closest would be gas $5.53 (option I), or $5.22 (option H). Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 800 cu.ft * (0.253 per 100) = 800/100 = 8; 8 * 0.253 = 2.024. That seems correct. So total before tax is 3.20 + 2.024 = 5.224. Tax is 5.224 * 0.06 = 0.31344. So total is 5.53744, which is $5.54, but the options don't have that exact number. Let me check the options again.

Option I: Gas bill $5.53. Maybe it's rounded down. Or perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Now, the phone bill. The basic charge is $6.27, plus long distance calls at $1.36 and $3.45. So the calls total 1.36 + 3.45 = $4.81. So the total before tax is 6.27 + 4.81 = $11.08.

But wait, the phone bill is subject to a 10% federal tax, and then 6% city tax. Wait, how are the taxes applied? Are they applied sequentially?

The question says: "Your phone bill, subject to a 10% federal tax..." So I think first the federal tax is applied to the total, and then the city tax? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the way it's written: "phone bill has a basic charge... subject to a 10% federal tax." So perhaps the federal tax is applied to the total, and then the city tax is applied to that sum.

Wait, let's compute step by step. The phone bill before any taxes is 6.27 + 1.36 + 3.45 = 6.27 + 4.81 = 11.08.

First, apply the 10% federal tax: 11.08 * 0.10 = 1.108, so total after federal tax is 11.08 + 1.108 = 12.188.

Then, apply the 6% city tax on this amount: 12.188 * 0.06 = 0.73128.

So total phone bill: 12.188 + 0.73128 ≈ 12.91928, which is approximately $12.92.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest would be option I with phone bill $12.86, or option D with $14.22.

Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the order of applying taxes. Alternatively, perhaps the city tax is applied before the federal tax, but that seems less likely. Or maybe both taxes are applied to the same base.

Wait, another approach: taxes are applied as follows. If a bill is subject to both federal and city taxes, sometimes they are compounded. So the total tax would be 10% + 6% + (10% * 6%) = 16.6% total tax. Wait, no, that's if they are applied one after another. Alternatively, the total tax factor would be 1.10 * 1.06 = 1.166.

Let me compute that way: 11.08 * 1.10 * 1.06.

First, 11.08 * 1.10 = 12.188.

Then, 12.188 * 1.06 = let's compute:

12.188 * 0.06 = 0.73128, so total is 12.188 + 0.73128 = 12.91928, same as before, about $12.92.

Looking at the options, none of the phone bills exactly match this. Let me check the options again:

Option I: Phone bill $12.86
Option J: Phone bill $11.76
Option D: $14.22
Others are lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phone bill. Let me check again.

The phone bill is $6.27 basic, plus two calls: $1.36 and $3.45. So 1.36 + 3.45 is indeed 4.81. So total before any taxes is 6.27 + 4.81 = 11.08.

Now, the federal tax is 10% on this amount: 11.08 * 0.10 = 1.108.

So after federal tax, it's 12.188.

Then, the city tax is 6% on this new amount: 12.188 * 0.06 = 0.73128.

So total phone bill is 12.188 + 0.73128 ≈ 12.919, which is $12.92.

But none of the options have exactly $12.92. The closest is option I at $12.86, but that's a bit off. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps the city tax is applied before the federal tax? Let me try that.

So first, apply city tax: 11.08 * 0.06 = 0.6648. So total becomes 11.08 + 0.6648 = 11.7448.

Then apply federal tax: 11.7448 * 0.10 = 1.17448.

Total: 11.7448 + 1.17448 ≈ 12.91928, same result. So the order doesn't change the final amount, because multiplication is commutative.

Hmm, so the total is approximately $12.92, but none of the options match exactly. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option I: Electric $11.00, Gas $5.53, Phone $12.86.

Hmm, $12.86 is close to 12.919, but it's a bit lower. Could it be that the calculation is done more precisely?

Wait, perhaps the exact computation would result in $12.86. Let me compute more accurately.

Phone total before taxes: $11.08.

Federal tax: 11.08 * 0.10 = 1.108.

City tax: (11.08 + 1.108) * 0.06 = 12.188 * 0.06.

Wait, 12.188 * 0.06:

0.06 * 12 = 0.72
0.06 * 0.188 = 0.01128
So total city tax: 0.72 + 0.01128 = 0.73128.

So total phone bill: 11.08 + 1.108 + 0.73128 = 12.91928.

Rounded to the nearest cent, that's $12.92. But in the options, the closest is I: $12.86, which is 6 cents less. Hmm, maybe the numbers were rounded differently, or perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, let me re-examine the gas calculation. Maybe I miscalculated there. The gas bill:

First 600: $3.20
Next 800: 800/100 = 8 units. 8 * 0.253 = 2.024
Total before tax: 3.20 + 2.024 = 5.224
Tax: 5.224 * 0.06 = 0.31344
Total: 5.224 + 0.31344 = 5.53744, which is $5.54 when rounded to the nearest cent.

But in option I, gas is $5.53, which is one cent less. Hmm, perhaps the rounding is done at each step, leading to a slightly lower total.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial gas usage is 1400 cu.ft. The first 600 is charged at $3.20, and the remaining 800 is charged at $0.253 per 100 cu.ft. So 800 cu.ft. is 8 * 100, so 8 * 0.253 = 2.024.

So before tax: 3.20 + 2.024 = 5.224.

Tax is 5.224 * 0.06 = 0.31344.

So total gas: 5.224 + 0.31344 = 5.53744, which is $5.54 when rounded to the nearest cent. So perhaps in the options, it's approximate.

Now, looking back at the electric bill: I calculated it as approximately $11.00 before tax, which after tax becomes about $11.00.

Wait, wait, no: the electric bill before tax was 10.3782, then 6% tax brings it to approximately 11.00.

So electric: ~$11.00, gas: ~$5.54, phone: ~$12.92.

Looking at the options:

Option I: Electric $11.00, Gas $5.53, Phone $12.86.

Hmm, that's very close. The phone bill in option I is $12.86, which is 6 cents less than my calculation. But perhaps the problem expects rounding at each step, leading to slight differences.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the electric bill calculation.

Wait, let me redo the electric bill step by step.

Electric bill:

Flat rate for first 15 kw-hrs: $1.70.

Then, the remaining 313 kw-hrs are split into:

45 hours at $0.043 per hour,
140 hours at $0.0318 per hour,
128 hours at $0.0179 per hour.

Wait, but wait a second. If the first 15 kw-hrs are a flat rate, and the total used is 328, then the remaining is 313 kw-hrs. But the sum of the hours (45 +140 +128 = 313) matches the remaining. So each of these hours represents kw-hrs used during that time.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 313 hours at, say, 1 kw would be 313 kw-hrs, but the usage is 328 kw-hrs. So perhaps the 45, 140, 128
