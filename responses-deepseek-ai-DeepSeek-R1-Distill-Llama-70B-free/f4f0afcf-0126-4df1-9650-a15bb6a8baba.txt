Options:

A: 14 in. × 3 in.
B: 16 in. × 4 in.
C: 18 in. × 6 in.
D: 15 in. × 5 in.

Okay, so I've got this problem here about designing a bar to resist pure tension. Hmm, let's see what I need to do. Alright, the problem says the bar needs to handle a pure tension of 4000 pounds, and there's a factor of safety of 2.5. The material's tensile strength is 175 psi. I need to pick the correct dimensions from the options given.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with tension, the formula involves stress and area. Stress is force over area, right? Oh wait, but we also have a factor of safety here. So the actual allowable stress would be the tensile strength divided by the factor of safety.

Let me write that down. So the allowable stress (σ_allowable) is 175 psi divided by 2.5. Let me calculate that. 175 divided by 2.5 equals... 70 psi. Yeah, because 2.5 times 70 is 175. So the bar can't have stress higher than 70 psi.

Now, the bar is under a tension force of 4000 lb. Stress is force divided by area, so σ = F/A. We want σ to be less than or equal to 70 psi. So rearranging the formula, the area A must be at least F divided by σ_allowable.

Putting in the numbers, 4000 lb divided by 70 psi equals the minimum area needed. Let me calculate that. 4000 /70 is approximately 57.14 square inches. So the cross-sectional area of the bar needs to be at least around 57.14 in².

Now I look at the options provided. Each option gives dimensions in inches, so I assume they are the width and height, making a rectangular bar. I'll calculate the area for each option to see which ones meet or exceed 57.14 in².

Option A: 14 in × 3 in. Area is 14 *3 =42 in². That's way below 57.14, so A is out.

Option B: 16 in ×4 in. Area is 16*4=64 in². That's above 57.14, so B is a possibility.

Option C:18 in ×6 in. Area is 18*6=108 in². That's way more than needed, but it's an option.

Option D:15 in ×5 in. Area is 15*5=75 in². Also above the required area.

So the options B, C, and D all have areas larger than 57.14. But wait, the problem might require the smallest possible area, or perhaps the correct one based on some other consideration. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says "design a bar" but doesn’t specify minimizing area or anything else. So any bar with area equal to or larger than 57.14 would work. But I need to look at the options.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me double-check. 4000 lb divided by 70 psi is 4000/70=57.1428... So yes, correct.

Looking at the options, B gives 64, which is just enough. C is 108, which is larger, but perhaps overkill. D is 75, which is also larger than required.

So the question is, which of these is the correct answer. The problem might be looking for the smallest area that meets the requirement. So the minimal area would be B's 64, which is the closest one above 57.14.

Wait, but wait—no, the problem doesn't specify choosing the smallest. It just asks for a bar that can resist the tension with the given factor of safety. So any of B, C, D would technically be correct. But the options only give one correct answer. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Oh wait, is the formula correct? Stress equals force over area. So yes, F=σ*A. So A=F/σ. So with F=4000 lb, σ=70 psi. So 4000/70 is indeed 57.14.

So the minimal area is 57.14, so any bar with area equal or higher is acceptable.

Looking back at the options:

A:42 – too small.

B:64 – acceptable.

C:108 – acceptable.

D:75 – acceptable.

But the question is to select the correct option from A to D. So perhaps the correct choice is the one that meets the minimum requirement. So the smallest area that just meets it. So option B is 64, which is just over 57.14. So perhaps B is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the units again. The force is given in pounds, and stress in psi, which is pounds per square inch. So using Imperial units correctly.

Yes, so everything checks out. So the correct answer is B:16 in ×4 in.

To design a bar to resist pure tension of 4000 lb with a factor of safety of 2.5 and a material tensile strength of 175 psi, we start by calculating the allowable stress:

\[
\sigma_{\text{allowable}} = \frac{\text{Tensile Strength}}{\text{Factor of Safety}} = \frac{175 \, \text{psi}}{2.5} = 70 \, \text{psi}.
\]

Next, we determine the minimum cross-sectional area required to resist the applied force of 4000 lb using the formula:

\[
A = \frac{\text{Force}}{\text{Allowable Stress}} = \frac{4000 \, \text{lb}}{70 \, \text{psi}} \approx 57.14 \, \text{in}^2.
\]

Now, we evaluate the given options to find the smallest cross-sectional area that meets or exceeds 57.14 in²:

- **Option A: 14 in × 3 in**  
  Area = \(14 \times 3 = 42 \, \text{in}^2\)  
  This is below the required area, so it is not acceptable.

- **Option B: 16 in × 4 in**  
  Area = \(16 \times 4 = 64 \, \text{in}^2\)  
  This is above the required area and is acceptable.

- **Option C: 18 in × 6 in**  
  Area = \(18 \times 6 = 108 \, \text{in}^2\)  
  This is well above the required area and is acceptable, though larger than necessary.

- **Option D: 15 in × 5 in**  
  Area = \(15 \times 5 = 75 \, \text{in}^2\)  
  This is also above the required area and is acceptable.

Since the problem does not specify minimizing the area, any option with an area equal to or greater than 57.14 in² is technically correct. However, the smallest area that meets the requirement is **Option B: 16 in × 4 in**.
