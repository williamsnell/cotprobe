Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the electrostatic energy of this system. Let me see... Okay, the setup is a point charge q at the center of a spherical conducting shell. The shell has an inner radius r₁ and an outer radius r₂. Hmm, I remember that conducting shells have some specific properties when it comes to electric fields and charges.

Wait, when you have a conducting shell, the charge on it resides on the outer surface, right? Because in electrostatics, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. So any excess charge on a conductor goes to the surface. But wait, the point charge is inside the shell. Oh, right, the shell is neutral unless it's charged. Wait, the question doesn't say the shell has any charge, so I guess the shell itself is neutral. But the point charge is q inside.

So the conducting shell is neutral, so it doesn't have any net charge. But because there's a point charge inside, the shell must have induced charges. Right, because the electric field from the point charge inside will induce charges on the inner surface of the shell. So the inner surface will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface will have +q because the shell is neutral overall. Wait, wait, no, because the shell is neutral, so the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q, making the total zero.

Wait, no, wait: the point charge is q. The inner surface of the conducting shell must have an induced charge of -q, so that the electric field within the conducting material (between r₁ and r₂) is zero. Then, to keep the shell neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. So the shell's total charge is zero, but it's split into -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer. But wait, the question doesn't mention the shell having any charge, so maybe the shell is uncharged. No, wait, no, if the shell is neutral, then the inner surface must be -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance it out. So the shell as a whole has zero charge.

But in this problem, the shell is just a conducting shell, and the point charge is inside. So the shell's inner radius is r₁, outer radius r₂. The point charge q is at the center.

Now, the question is about the electrostatic energy of the system. Hmm, electrostatic energy is usually the potential energy stored in the system due to the configuration of charges. For a system of point charges, it's the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But for continuous charge distributions, it's a bit different.

Wait, but in this case, the point charge is at the center, and the shell has induced charges. So the system consists of the point charge q and the induced charges on the shell's inner and outer surfaces. But wait, the induced charges are due to q, so maybe we can model this as the point charge interacting with the induced charges on the shell.

Alternatively, another approach is to think about the work done in assembling the system. The potential energy U is the work done to bring the charges from infinity to their positions in the system.

So first, let's consider the charges present. There's the point charge q at the center. Then, on the inner surface of the shell, there's a charge -q, and on the outer surface, a charge +q. So the shell's inner and outer surfaces have charges -q and +q respectively.

But wait, if the shell is neutral overall, then yes, because (-q) + (+q) = 0. So the system has the point charge q, and the shell's inner (-q) and outer (+q) charges.

Now, to compute the electrostatic potential energy, I need to find the work done in assembling these charges. However, sometimes it's easier to compute the potential energy using the formula U = (1/2) Q V, where Q is the charge and V is the potential at the location of Q due to all other charges.

Alternatively, since the system has multiple parts (the point charge and the shell's inner and outer surfaces), perhaps it's better to compute the energy as the sum of the energies of each pair.

Wait, but let's think about the potential at each location due to the other charges. Let me break it down.

First, the point charge q is placed at the center. Then, the shell's inner surface is at r₁, outer at r₂. The potential at the center due to the inner surface charge and the outer surface charge.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure this.

The electrostatic potential energy (U) of a system of charges is given by:

U = (1/2) Σ Q_i V_i

Where V_i is the potential at the location of charge Q_i due to all other charges in the system.

So our system has four parts?

Wait, no. The point charge is q at the center. The inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. So the system is made of three charges: q, -q, and +q.

Wait, but the inner and outer surfaces are both parts of the conducting shell, which is a conductor, so their charges are induced. But when calculating the potential energy, I should consider each of these as separate charges.

So, let's compute the potential energy contributed by each pair.

Wait, but perhaps a different approach would be easier. The energy can be found by considering the work done in bringing each charge into position.

So, the point charge q is at the center. Then, the inner surface has charge -q, and the outer surface +q. So:

1. Bringing the point charge q into the center: What's the potential here? Since it's the first charge, the potential is zero, so no work is needed. Or wait, the potential at a point before placing any charges is zero, so the work to bring q to the center is zero.

Wait, no. Because when you bring a charge from infinity, the potential at the point where you bring it is due to all other charges already present. Since this is the first charge, the work done is zero.

2. Next, bringing the inner surface charge (-q) onto the inner surface of the shell. The inner surface is a sphere of radius r₁. The potential at the inner surface (r = r₁) is due to the point charge q at the center.

So the potential V_inner_surface due to q is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / r₁.

The charge being placed is -q, so the work done is (-q) * V_inner_surface.

So work W1 = (-q) * (1/(4πε₀)) (q / r₁) ) = - q²/(4πε₀ r₁).

3. Then, we need to bring the outer surface charge (+q) onto the outer surface of the shell, which is at radius r₂.

Now, the potential at r₂ is due to two charges: the point charge q and the inner surface charge (-q). But wait, wait: For a conducting shell, the electric field inside the conducting material is zero, so the potential due to the inner charge (-q) doesn't affect the potential outside the shell. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the potential inside a conducting shell (i.e., inside the conductor) is the same as on the surface. But for points outside the shell, the potential is due to the total charge of the shell (which is +q on the outer surface). Wait, wait, no, the shell's inner surface is -q, outer is +q. So from the outside, the shell's charge is +q, and from inside the shell's cavity, it's -q.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: The conducting shell has an inner radius r₁ and outer radius r₂. Inside the cavity (r < r₁), the electric field is due to the point charge q and the inner surface charge -q. But wait, the inner surface charge -q is on the inner surface of the conducting shell. So within the cavity, the field is due to q and the inner surface charge.

But wait, the point charge q is at the center, and the inner surface has -q. So the electric field inside the cavity (r < r₁) would be due to q and the inner surface's -q. But wait, no, because the inner surface is a shell, its field inside (r < r₁) is zero. So the field in the cavity is only due to the point charge q.

Wait, that's correct. The electric field inside a conducting shell's cavity (r < r₁) is only due to the charges inside the cavity. So the conducting shell's inner surface having -q doesn't contribute to the field in the cavity—it's like the cavity is shielded from the inner surface charge. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the conducting material of the shell is a conductor, and the field within the conductor is zero. So the field inside the cavity is due to the point charge q. The inner surface's -q is on the inner surface of the conducting shell, which is at r = r₁. So, inside the cavity (r < r₁), the field is due to q only. Between r₁ and r₂, the field is zero because it's in the conductor. Outside the shell (r > r₂), the field is due to the outer surface charge, which is +q.

So when we bring the outer surface charge +q onto the outer surface (r = r₂), the potential at r₂ is due to the point charge q, the inner surface charge -q, and any charges already present on the outer surface. Wait, but when we bring the +q to the outer surface, what is the potential at that point?

Wait, the potential at the outer surface (r = r₂) is due to the point charge q and the inner surface charge -q. Because the point charge is at the center, so at r = r₂, the potential from q is (1/(4πε₀))(q / r₂). The inner surface charge of -q is on a sphere of radius r₁, so for points outside r₁, like r₂, the potential due to a shell of charge -q is (-q)/(4πε₀ r₂). So the total potential at r = r₂ when placing the +q charge is:

V = (1/(4πε₀))( q / r₂ ) + (-q)/(4πε₀ r₂) ) = (q - q)/(4πε₀ r₂ ) = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the point charge is inside the cavity, and the inner surface is at r₁. So the potential at r₂ due to q is (1/(4πε₀))(q / r₂). The potential at r₂ due to the inner surface (-q) is (1/(4πε₀))(-q / r₂), since the inner surface is a shell with radius r₁, so for points outside r₁, the potential is same as if the charge were at the center. So the total potential at r₂ is (q/(4πε₀ r₂)) - (q/(4πε₀ r₂)) ) = 0.

So the work done to bring the +q charge to the outer surface is W2 = (+q) * V = 0.

Wait, that's strange. So the work done in bringing the outer charge is zero? That doesn't seem right. Because the +q is being placed on the outer surface, which is influenced by the existing charges.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Because when we bring the +q to the outer surface, the potential there is due to q (the point charge) and the inner surface (-q). So yes, their contributions cancel out. So the potential at r₂ is zero, so the work done is zero. That's interesting.

So the total work done is W = W1 + W2 = (-q²)/(4πε₀ r₁) + 0 = -q²/(4πε₀ r₁).

Wait, but that would imply that the potential energy U is negative, which makes sense because bringing opposite charges together releases energy. But wait, in reality, the system's potential energy should be the sum of all the work done in assembling the charges.

Wait, but I'm missing something. Because the shell's charges are induced by the point charge. So the shell itself doesn't have any charges initially. So when the point charge is placed at the center, it induces -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface. So maybe we should model the system as just the point charge and the induced charges on the shell.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the system can be considered as the energy stored in the electric fields. The formula for the electrostatic energy U is (1/2) ε₀ ∫ E² dV over all space.

But that might be more complicated, but perhaps it's a viable approach.

Alternatively, since the conducting shell is a conductor, the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So the regions where E is non-zero are:

1. Inside the cavity (r < r₁): E is due to the point charge q. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q / r²) radially outward.

2. Outside the shell (r > r₂): E is due to the outer surface charge +q. So E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q / r²) radially outward.

Between r₁ and r₂ (the conducting shell), E is zero.

So the energy U would be the integral of (1/2) ε₀ E² dV in the regions where E is non-zero.

So let's compute that.

First, inside the cavity (r < r₁):

E = (q/(4πε₀ r²)) ȓ.

So E² = (q²)/(16 πε₀² r⁴)

The volume element dV = 4π r² dr.

So the integral for the cavity region becomes:

U1 = (1/2) ε₀ * ∫ (q²)/(16 πε₀² r⁴) * 4π r² dr, integrated from 0 to r₁.

Let me compute U1.

U1 = (1/2) ε₀ * (q²) / (16 πε₀²) * 4π ∫ (r² / r⁴) dr from 0 to r₁

Simplify:

(1/2) * (1/ (16 πε₀)) * 4π q² ∫ (1/r²) dr from 0 to r₁

Wait, let's compute the coefficients:

(1/2) * (1/(16 πε₀)) * 4π = (1/2) * (4π)/(16 πε₀) ) = (4π)/(32 πε₀) ) = π/(8 ε₀)

Wait, no, perhaps better to compute the constants step by step.

Wait, U1 = (1/2) ε₀ * (q²)/(16 πε₀²) * 4π ∫ (1/r²) dr from 0 to r₁.

Simplify:

(1/2) * (1/(16 πε₀)) * 4π * q² ∫ (1/r²) dr.

Wait, let's compute the constants:

(1/2) * (4π) / (16 πε₀) ) ) = (4π) / (32 πε₀) ) = π/(8 ε₀)

So U1 = (π/(8 ε₀)) q² ∫ (1/r²) dr from 0 to r₁.

The integral of 1/r² dr is [-1/r] evaluated from 0 to r₁. But wait, from 0 to r₁, the lower limit is 0, which would go to negative infinity. That can't be right. Hmm, that suggests that the integral diverges, which doesn't make sense. Wait, but this must be wrong because the energy should be finite.

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the integral. Let's go back.

The integral for U1 is from 0 to r₁ of (1/2) ε₀ E² dV.

E² is (q²)/(16 π² ε₀² r^4), since E = q/(4 π ε₀ r²) → E² = q²/(16 π² ε₀² r^4).

Wait, wait, no. Because E = (1/(4 π ε₀)) (q/r²) → E² = q²/(16 π² ε₀² r^4).

So (1/2) ε₀ E² = (1/2) ε₀ * q²/(16 π² ε₀² r^4) ) = q²/(32 π² ε₀ r^4).

Then, dV is 4 π r² dr.

So U1 is integral from 0 to r₁ of [ q²/(32 π² ε₀ r^4) ] * 4 π r² dr.

Simplify:

q²/(32 π² ε₀) * 4 π ∫ (r² / r^4) dr from 0 to r₁.

Which is q²/(32 π² ε₀) * 4 π ∫ (1/r²) dr.

Simplify the constants:

4π / (32 π² ε₀) ) = 1/(8 π ε₀).

So U1 = (1/(8 π ε₀)) q² ∫ (1/r²) dr from 0 to r₁.

The integral ∫ (1/r²) dr is -1/r + C.

Evaluated from 0 to r₁, it's (-1/r₁) - (lim_{r→0} (-1/r)) → (-1/r₁) - (infinity) → negative infinity. That's not possible, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, that suggests that the energy inside the cavity is infinite, which can't be right. So perhaps this approach isn't correct. Maybe because I'm treating the point charge as a continuous distribution, but it's actually a point charge, so the electric field diverges at r=0, leading to an infinite energy. Hmm, but that's a problem. So maybe calculating the energy via the electric field isn't the right approach here. Or perhaps I should model the system differently.

Let me try a different approach. The system consists of the point charge q and the induced charges on the shell. The shell's inner surface has charge -q, outer surface +q. So the system's charges are q (point), -q (inner), and +q (outer). Wait, but that's three charges, but actually, the shell's charges are induced by q, so perhaps the shell itself doesn't contribute any charge. So the total system's charge is q (point) + (-q + q) (shell) ) = q + 0 = q.

Wait, but for the purpose of calculating potential energy, each pair of charges contributes. So the potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

So the pairs are:

1. Point charge q and inner surface (-q).

2. Point charge q and outer surface (+q).

3. Inner surface (-q
