Okay, let's see. I have this question about functions between sets A and B. There are two functions: f maps A to B, and g maps B to A. The condition given is that for every a in A, g(f(a)) equals a. So, g composed with f is the identity on A. Hmm, what does that imply about f?

The question has two statements. Statement 1 says f must necessarily be injective. Statement 2 says f must necessarily be surjective. I need to evaluate both statements.

First, I remember some function properties. Injective means one-to-one: if f(a1) = f(a2), then a1 = a2. Surjective means onto: for every b in B, there's an a in A such that f(a) = b.

Since g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, that suggests that f is injective. Because if f(a1) = f(a2), then applying g to both gives a1 = a2. So f must be injective. So Statement 1 seems true.

What about Statement 2, f being surjective? Wait, if f is not surjective, that means there are elements in B that are not hit by f. But does that contradict the condition we have? Let me think. Suppose there's a b in B that's not in the image of f. Does that cause any problem with g(f(a)) = a?

Well, g is a function from B to A. So for elements in B not in f(A), g can map them anywhere. But since g(f(a)) = a, it doesn't impose any condition on those other elements. So f doesn't have to be surjective. For example, if A is a subset of B, and f is the inclusion map, then g would be the projection back to A. In that case, f is injective but not surjective unless A = B.

So Statement 2 is not necessarily true. It depends on the specific sets and functions. So the answer would be that Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false. Wait, looking at the options, option I says True, False. But let me double-check.

Wait, let me think again. If g is a function such that g(f(a)) = a, then f must be injective because, as I thought before, f(a1)=f(a2) implies a1=a2. So Statement 1 is necessarily true.

For Statement 2, f must be surjective onto B? No, because g only needs to map f(A) back to A correctly, but g could map other elements of B elsewhere. So f doesn't have to cover all of B. So f doesn't have to be surjective. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

So the correct answer would be that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false. Looking at the options, option I is "True, False". So the answer should be I.

The question involves functions \( f: A \to B \) and \( g: B \to A \) such that \( g(f(a)) = a \) for all \( a \in A \). This implies that \( g \circ f \) is the identity function on \( A \). 

### Analysis of Statement 1: \( f \) must necessarily be injective.
- A function is injective if \( f(a_1) = f(a_2) \) implies \( a_1 = a_2 \).
- Since \( g(f(a)) = a \), if \( f(a_1) = f(a_2) \), applying \( g \) to both sides gives \( a_1 = a_2 \). Thus, \( f \) must be injective.
- **Conclusion:** Statement 1 is true.

### Analysis of Statement 2: \( f \) must necessarily be surjective.
- A function is surjective if for every \( b \in B \), there exists an \( a \in A \) such that \( f(a) = b \).
- The condition \( g(f(a)) = a \) only ensures that \( g \) maps \( f(A) \) back to \( A \). It does not require \( f(A) \) to cover all of \( B \). For example, if \( A \subset B \) and \( f \) is the inclusion map, \( f \) is injective but not surjective unless \( A = B \).
- **Conclusion:** Statement 2 is false.

### Final Answer:
Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false. The correct option is:

**I: True, False**
