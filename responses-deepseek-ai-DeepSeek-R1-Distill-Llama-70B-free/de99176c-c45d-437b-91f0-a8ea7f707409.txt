Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the effective annual yield of a bank account. Hmm, I remember that effective annual yield has to do with compound interest, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

The question says the interest is compounded daily at a rate of 7%. Oh right, and the effective annual rate is calculated by finding the difference between the final and initial balances, then dividing by the initial. So it's like the actual interest earned over the year as a percentage.

Wait, the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Right, where:
- A is the amount after time t,
- P is the principal,
- r is the annual interest rate,
- n is the number of times interest is compounded per year,
- t is the time in years.

Since it's compounded daily, n is 365, assuming it's not a leap year. The time here is 1 year, so t=1.

So the effective annual yield would be (A - P)/P, which simplifies to (1 + r/n)^(n) - 1.

Let me plug in the numbers. r is 7%, so 0.07. n is 365.

So the calculation is (1 + 0.07/365)^365 - 1. That should give me the effective rate.

Wait, I don't have a calculator here, but maybe I can approximate it. Oh wait, I remember that the formula (1 + r/n)^(n) approaches e^r as n approaches infinity. So e^0.07 is about 1.0725, which would make the effective rate approximately 7.25%. But since 365 is a large number, the effective rate should be a bit less than that.

Wait, no. Actually, e^r is the limit as n approaches infinity, so for n=365, the effective rate is slightly less than e^0.07. Let me think: e^0.07 is about 1.0725, so 7.25% effective. But wait, the options don't have 7.25 as an option. Let me check the options again.

Options are A:7.18, B:7.12, C:7.5, D:7.6, E:6.95, F:7.25, G:7.30, H:6.9, I:7, J:6.85.

Oh wait, option F is 7.25. But I thought the daily compounding would give a rate a little lower than that. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again.

The formula is (1 + 0.07/365)^365. Let me compute it step by step.

0.07 divided by 365 is approximately 0.00019178.

So (1 + 0.00019178) is 1.00019178. Now raising this to the power of 365.

This is the same as e^(365 * ln(1.00019178)).

But I can approximate ln(1+x) for small x as x - x²/2 + x³/3... So ln(1.00019178) ≈ 0.00019178 - (0.00019178)^2 / 2.

Calculating that: 0.00019178 squared is about 3.68e-8. Divided by 2 is 1.84e-8. So ln(1.00019178) ≈ 0.00019178 - 0.0000000184 ≈ 0.00019176.

So 365 times that is approximately 365 * 0.00019176 = 0.0700684.

So e^0.0700684. What's e^0.07? Let's see, e^0.07 is about 1.072508. But our exponent is 0.0700684, which is a little higher.

So e^0.0700684 would be a bit more than 1.0725. Let me calculate the difference.

The difference between 0.0700684 and 0.07 is 0.0000684. So e^0.07 * e^0.0000684.

e^0.0000684 is approximately 1 + 0.0000684 + (0.0000684)^2/2. Which is about 1.0000684 + 0.0000000023 ≈ 1.0000684.

So total e^0.0700684 ≈ 1.072508 * 1.0000684 ≈ 1.072575. So about 7.2575%.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the effective rate is (1 + 0.07/365)^365 - 1. Which would be approximately 7.2575% as above, so around 7.26%. But let's check the options again.

Option F is 7.25%, which is close. Option G is 7.30. Hmm. Maybe my approximation is a bit off. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (1 + 0.07/365)^365 more accurately. Let me try using a calculator approach.

Wait, 0.07/365 is approximately 0.00019178. So each day, the multiplier is 1.00019178.

Now, (1.00019178)^365. Let me think in terms of logarithms.

Take natural log: ln(1.00019178) = approximately 0.00019176.

Multiply by 365: 0.00019176 * 365 = 0.0700684.

Now, e^0.0700684 = ?

We know that e^0.07 = 1.072508177.

What's the difference? The exponent is 0.0700684, which is 0.07 + 0.0000684. So, e^0.07 * e^0.0000684.

We can approximate e^0.0000684 as 1 + 0.0000684 + (0.0000684)^2/2.

Calculating: 0.0000684 + (0.00000467) = 0.00007307.

So e^0.0000684 ≈ 1.00007307.

So e^0.0700684 ≈ 1.072508 * 1.00007307 ≈ 1.072508 + (1.072508 * 0.00007307).

Calculating 1.072508 * 0.00007307: Approximately 0.0000784.

So total is 1.0725864, which is about 7.25864%.

So the effective yield is approximately 7.2586%, which is about 7.26%.

Looking back at the options, F is 7.25%, which is very close. But perhaps the options are rounded to two decimal places, so 7.26% would round to 7.26%, which isn't an option. Wait, the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake in the approximation. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation is better. Let me try to compute (1 + 0.07/365)^365.

But without a calculator, it's challenging. However, I remember that for daily compounding, the effective annual rate is slightly higher than the nominal rate. So 7% would result in a bit more than 7% when compounded daily.

Wait, if it's compounded daily, the effective rate is higher than the nominal. Because the more frequent compounding, the more interest earned. So let's compute it more accurately.

I think the exact value is (1 + 0.07/365)^365 ≈ e^(0.07) * (1 - (0.07)^2/(2*365)) )? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1 + r/n)^(n) = e^r * (1 - r/(2n) + ... )? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps using the Taylor expansion for (1 + x)^n, where x is small. But I'm not confident about that approach.

Alternatively, I remember that the effective annual rate for daily compounding with 7% is approximately 7.26%. So looking at the options, the closest would be F:7.25% or G:7.30%. Since 7.26 is closer to 7.25, perhaps F is the answer. But wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of more accurate calculation. Let's compute 365 * ln(1 + 0.07/365).

So 0.07/365 = 0.00019178. ln(1.00019178) ≈ 0.00019176 as before. Multiply by 365: 0.00019176 *365 = 0.0700684.

Now, e^0.0700684. Let's compute this more accurately.

We know that e^0.07 is 1.072508177.

The additional 0.0000684 in the exponent:

e^0.0700684 = e^(0.07 + 0.0000684) = e^0.07 * e^0.0000684.

As before, e^0.0000684 is approximately 1.0000684 + (0.0000684)^2/2 + (0.0000684)^3/6.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the Taylor series for e^x around x=0.07.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x^3/6.

So x here is 0.0700684.

So e^(0.0700684) ≈ 1 + 0.0700684 + (0.0700684)^2/2 + (0.0700684)^3/6.

Compute each term:

1st term: 1.

2nd term: 0.0700684.

3rd term: (0.0700684)^2 = 0.0049142. Divided by 2: 0.0024571.

4th term: (0.0700684)^3 = approx 0.000345. Divided by 6: ~0.0000575.

Adding them up: 1 + 0.0700684 = 1.0700684; plus 0.0024571 gives 1.0725255; plus 0.0000575 gives ~1.072583.

So e^0.0700684 ≈ 1.072583, so the effective rate is 7.2583%. So about 7.26%.

Looking back at the options, the closest is F:7.25% and G:7.30%. So 7.26 is closer to 7.25 than 7.30, so the answer would be F.

Wait, but another way to think: perhaps the exact calculation with (1 + 0.07/365)^365 is actually closer to 7.25% or 7.26%. Since the options don’t have 7.26, F is 7.25, which is the closest. So I think the correct answer is F:7.25%.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Because I remember that the effective annual rate for 7% compounded daily is approximately 7.26%, which isn't exactly in the options, but perhaps the options are rounded.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute (1 + 0.07/365)^365 = e^(365 * ln(1 + 0.07/365)).

But without precise calculation, I can't be certain. But given the options, I'd go with F:7.25%.
</think>

To calculate the effective annual yield of a bank account with a nominal interest rate of 7% compounded daily, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Effective Annual Yield} = \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^n - 1
\]

where:
- \( r = 0.07 \) (the nominal interest rate),
- \( n = 365 \) (the number of compounding periods per year).

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Effective Annual Yield} = \left(1 + \frac{0.07}{365}\right)^{365} - 1
\]

### Step 1: Approximate \( \frac{0.07}{365} \)
\[
\frac{0.07}{365} \approx 0.00019178
\]

Thus, the formula becomes:

\[
\left(1 + 0.00019178\right)^{365} - 1
\]

### Step 2: Simplify using logarithms
To approximate \( \left(1 + 0.00019178\right)^{365} \), we use the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(1 + 0.00019178\right) \approx 0.00019176
\]

Multiply by 365:

\[
365 \times 0.00019176 \approx 0.0700684
\]

Now, calculate \( e^{0.0700684} \). Using the Taylor series expansion for \( e^x \), we find:

\[
e^{0.0700684} \approx 1.072583
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Effective Annual Yield} = 1.072583 - 1 = 0.072583 \approx 7.26\%
\]

### Step 3: Match to the closest option
The calculated effective annual yield is approximately 7.26%. Among the given options, the closest value is **7.25% (Option F)**.

### Final Answer:
F
