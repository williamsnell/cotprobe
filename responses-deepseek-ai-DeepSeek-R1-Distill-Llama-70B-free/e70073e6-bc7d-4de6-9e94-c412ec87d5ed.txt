Question:

A state highway runs through the center of a city's business district. As the highway passes through this business district, there is a stretch where the highway is too narrow to satisfS' the safety standards for state roadways. Along this narrow stretch and on opposite sides of the street are located two businesses. Situated on the east side of the street is a bar and grill; directly across the street on the west side is a lounge. In order to comply with state highway regulations, the state highway department, acting pursuant to state statute, ordered the city to prohibit parking on one side of the highway within the business district. The city council convened a special meeting to determine whether parking should be prohibited on the east or west side of the street. During the meeting, the council was unable to resolve the issue. Finally, the city council president decided the only fair way to resolve the matter was to flip a coin. After the coin flip, the city prohibited parking at all times on the west side of the highway. On account of this decision, parking in front of the lounge was permanently prohibited. This caused the lounge to suffer a substantial decline in business because of the unavailability of on-street parking. As a consequence, the owner of the lounge brought suit for declarative relief against the city alleging that the parking ban on his side of the street was unconstitutional. In all likelihood, will the plaintiff be successful in this cause of action?

Options:

A: No, because as a governmental entity, the city enjoys immunity from such suits under the Eleventh Amendment.
B: No, because the city was acting in accordance with state highway safety regulations.
C: Yes, because the action of the city violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
D: No, because the city's action was reasonable.
E: Yes, because the city council failed to consider the economic impact of their decision on the lounge.
F: No, because the city council president's decision to flip a coin was arbitrary and capricious.
G: No, because the state highway department's order supersedes any claim by the lounge owner.
H: Yes, because the prohibition of parking constitutes a taking of property without just compensation.
I: Yes, because the city council's decision unfairly targeted businesses on the west side of the street.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand the situation.

So, there's a state highway that goes through a city's business district. The part where it's narrow doesn't meet safety standards, so the state highway department tells the city to prohibit parking on one side. The city council can't decide which side, so they flip a coin and end up banning parking on the west side. This affects a lounge there, causing a big drop in business because people can't park out front. The lounge owner sues the city, claiming the parking ban is unconstitutional.

The question is whether the plaintiff (lounge owner) will win the case.

The options are A through I. I need to think about constitutional law principles, probably equal protection or something like that.

Let me break it down. The city prohibited parking on one side, west, which impacted the lounge. The decision was made by flipping a coin because they couldn't decide. So the issue is whether this action violates any constitutional rights.

First, considering the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Equal protection says that similarly situated individuals should be treated similarly. Here, the two sides of the street are across from each other, and the only difference is which businesses are there—a bar and grill on the east, a lounge on the west. The parking ban was applied to one side but not the other.

The city's reason for the ban is to comply with state highway safety regulations. But the way they chose which side was arbitrary—a coin flip. So the question is if the city's decision was reasonable or if it violated equal protection.

I remember that when the government action affects fundamental rights, strict scrutiny applies, but here parking might not be a fundamental right. More likely, rational basis review. But wait, if the law implicates equal protection, the government's action must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest.

In this case, the legitimate interest is highway safety. But the method of choosing which side—flipping a coin—doesn't seem to have any rational basis related to that interest. It's arbitrary. So even if the goal is legitimate, the method wasn't based on any reason related to safety. They could have looked at factors like which side has more traffic, more businesses, pedestrian activity, etc. But flipping a coin doesn't consider any of that.

So the decision to pick one side over the other without a rational reason could be seen as violating equal protection. Because the businesses on each side are similarly situated, and the state treated them differently without a rational basis.

Looking at the options, option C says yes because it violated the equal protection clause. Option D says no because the action was reasonable. But if the method was arbitrary, then it's not reasonable. Option F says no because the coin flip was arbitrary and capricious, but that's more about administrative law, not constitutional. The question is about whether it's unconstitutional, so equal protection is more likely the angle.

Option H mentions taking without compensation. Prohibiting parking might be a regulatory taking, but generally, such traffic regulations are seen as permissible and don't require compensation. So H is probably not the right answer.

Option I says yes because it targeted west side businesses, but that's more about equal protection as well. C and I seem similar, but C is broader about equal protection, while I is about targeting, which might imply a specific intent, which isn't stated here.

So the most likely correct answer is C: Yes, because the city's action violated the equal protection clause. The arbitrary decision without a rational basis treats similar businesses differently.

The situation involves a city forced to prohibit parking on one side of a state highway for safety reasons. The city council, unable to decide which side, used a coin flip, resulting in a parking ban on the west side. This decision impacted a lounge, causing a significant decline in business. The lounge owner sued, alleging the ban was unconstitutional.

The key issue is whether the city's action violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Equal protection requires that similarly situated individuals or businesses be treated similarly unless there is a rational basis for the differentiation. Here, the businesses on both sides of the street were similarly situated, but the city chose to ban parking on one side arbitrarily through a coin flip. This method lacks a rational connection to the state's interest in highway safety, as no relevant factors (e.g., traffic, pedestrian activity) were considered.

Option C correctly identifies that the city's arbitrary decision violated the Equal Protection Clause by treating similarly situated businesses differently without a rational basis. Other options, such as D and F, are less relevant because the decision's arbitrariness undermines its reasonableness, and the constitutional issue is better addressed under equal protection than administrative law.
