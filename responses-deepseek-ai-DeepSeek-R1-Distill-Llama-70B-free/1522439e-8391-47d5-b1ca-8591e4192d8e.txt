Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the mass of oxygen in a cylinder, and I'm a bit rusty on my gas laws, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the given data: the cylinder has oxygen at 10 atm pressure, a temperature of 300 K, and a volume of 10 liters. I need to find the mass. Hmm, I remember that the ideal gas law is probably going to be useful here. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, right? Where P is pressure, V volume, n moles, R the gas constant, and T temperature.

But wait, I need mass, so I'll have to find moles first and then convert to grams using the molar mass. Oh right, oxygen's molar mass is 32 g/mol because each O atom is 16, and O2 is 32.

So, let's list the values:

P = 10 atm
V = 10 L
T = 300 K
R is the gas constant. I think R can be 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when using these units. Yeah, because when pressure is in atm and volume in liters, R is 0.0821.

Wait, so plugging into PV = nRT. So n = PV/(RT). Let me compute that.

P*V = 10 atm * 10 L = 100 L·atm.

RT = 0.0821 * 300. Let me calculate that. 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63.

So n = 100 / 24.63. Let me do that division. 100 divided by 24.63. Hmm, 24.63 *4 is about 98.52, because 24 *4 is 96, 0.63*4 is 2.52, so 98.52. So 4 gives 98.52, which is just under 100. The difference is 1.48. So 1.48 /24.63 is about 0.06. So n is approximately 4.06 moles? Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 100 divided by 24.63. Let me do it with a calculator in my head. 24.63 times 4 is 98.52, as I said. So 100 is 98.52 +1.48. So 1.48 /24.63 is approximately 0.06. So n≈4.06 mol.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it more accurately. 24.63 × x =100. 

24.63 * 4 = 98.52, remainder 1.48. So 1.48 /24.63 = approximately 0.06. So n≈4.06 moles.

Wait, but wait, perhaps it's better to calculate it more precisely. Let me do 24.63 × 4.06. 

4 ×24.63=98.52; 0.06 ×24.63=1.4778. So adding 98.52 +1.4778=99.9978, which is almost 100. So n≈4.06 mol.

But let me check with actual division. 100 ÷24.63. Let me see:

24.63 goes into 100 four times, as 4*24.63=98.52. Subtract that from 100, we get 1.48.

Bring down a zero, making it 14.8 (wait, but wait, 1.48 is after the decimal, so perhaps I should consider 1.48 as 14.8 when moving to tenths place). Let me think: 24.63 goes into 14.8 zero times. So we write 0. Next, bring down another zero, making it 148. Now, 24.63 goes into 148 how many times? Let's see: 24.63 *6=147.78. So that's 6 times. Subtract 147.78 from 148, we get 0.22. Bring down another zero, making it 2.2. 24.63 goes into 2.2 zero times. So next digit is 0. Bring down another zero, making it 22.0. 24.63 goes into 22.0 zero times. So perhaps it's 4.06 approximately, because the next digits are getting small. So n≈4.06 mol.

Now, moles to grams: molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol. So mass m= n * M.

m=4.06 mol *32g/mol= 4.06 *32.

Let me compute 4 *32=128, and 0.06 *32=1.92. So total is 128+1.92=129.92 grams.

Wait a minute, but looking at the options, the closest is option G: 130.08 grams. Hmm, but my calculation gives about 129.92, which is approximately 130 grams. So why is option G 130.08? Did I miscalculate something?

Wait perhaps I was too approximate with n. Let me recalculate n more accurately.

n= PV/(RT) = (10 atm *10 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K *300 K)

So numerator is 100.

Denominator is 0.0821 *300=24.63.

n=100/24.63 = let's compute this with more precision.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approach. Let me do long division.

100 divided by 24.63.

24.63 ×4=98.52 → 4.0 → remainder 1.48.

Bring down a zero: 14.8 → 24.63 goes into 14.8 zero times. So 4.0 → 4.00.

Bring down another zero: 148.0 → 24.63 ×6=147.78 → 6. → remainder 0.22.

Bring down a zero: 2.20 → 24.63 goes into 2.20 zero times.

Bring down another zero: 22.0 → 24.63 can't go in, so next digit is 0.

So n≈4.06 after a few steps, but perhaps more accurately, let's calculate 100/24.63.

Alternatively, I can compute 24.63 ×4.06 = 24.63*(4 +0.06) = (24.63*4) + (24.63*0.06) = 98.52 + 1.4778= 99.9978, which is very close to 100. So n=4.06 is accurate enough.

So m=4.06 *32= 129.92 grams.

But the options don't have 130, but option G is 130.08 grams. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations, or perhaps I should carry more decimal places.

Wait another approach: perhaps I should compute n more accurately.

n=100/(0.0821 *300)

Calculate denominator exactly: 0.0821 *300 = 24.63.

So n=100/24.63.

Let me compute 100 ÷24.63 precisely.

I can write 24.63 as 2463/100, so 100/(2463/100) )= 100 * (100/2463) )= 10000/2463.

Let me compute 10000 ÷2463.

2463 *4=9852 → 4*2463=9852. Subtract from 10000: 10000-9852=148.

So 148 left. Bring down a zero: 1480.

2463 goes into 1480 zero times. Next digit is 0.

Bring down another zero: 14800.

How many times does 2463 go into 14800?

Compute 2463 *6=14778 → 6*2463=14778.

Subtracting, 14800-14778=22.

So 22 left. So 14800/2463=6 with remainder 22.

So overall, 10000/2463=4.06 (approximately up to four decimal places: 4.0608?)

Wait, let me see:

10000 ÷2463 = 4.0608 approximately.

Wait, because 2463 ×4.06 = ?

4.06 =4 +0.06.

2463 ×4=9852.

2463 ×0.06=147.78.

Total =9852+147.78= 9999.78.

Which is very close to 10000, so 4.06 gives 9999.78, and the actual value is 4.0608.

So n=4.0608 mol.

Then, m=4.0608 *32 = let's compute that.

4 *32=128.

0.0608 *32= 1.9456.

So 128 +1.9456=129.9456 grams, approximately 129.95 grams.

So about 130 grams.

Looking at the options, option G is 130.08 grams, which is very close. So probably, the exact calculation gives something like 130.08.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise R value. Wait, R is 0.082057 L·atm/(mol·K), which is approximately 0.082057. So perhaps using more precise R gives a slightly different n.

Let me recalculate with R=0.082057.

n=100/(0.082057 *300)=100/(24.6171)= approx?

24.6171 *4=98.4684.

Subtracting from 100 gives 1.5316.

1.5316 /24.6171 ≈0.0622.

So n≈4.0622 mol.

Then m=4.0622 *32= let's compute.

4*32=128.

0.0622 *32=1.9904.

Total m=128+1.9904=129.9904 grams, approximately 130 grams.

Hmm, but the option G is 130.08, which is a bit higher. So perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, another approach. Let's compute n precisely.

n = (10 atm *10 L) / (0.082057 *300 K)

n=100/(24.6171) ≈4.0622 mol.

Mass m=4.0622 *32= ?

Compute 4 *32=128, 0.0622 *32=1.9904 → total 129.9904 g, which is 129.99 g, approximately 130.

But the option G is 130.08, which is a bit higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Or maybe the initial data uses a different value for R.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to use R=0.0821, as I did initially.

Wait, let's compute n with R=0.0821:

n = 100/(0.0821 *300) =100/(24.63)= approx 4.0608 mol.

Then m=4.0608 *32= 129.9456 grams, which is approx 129.95, so 130.0 grams.

But the option G is 130.08, which is off by about 0.13 grams. Hmm, that's a bit strange. Maybe I should recheck my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 4.0608 ×32 more accurately.

4.0608 ×32:

Calculate 4 ×32 =128.

0.0608 ×32: 0.06 ×32=1.92, 0.0008×32=0.0256.

So 1.92 +0.0256=1.9456.

Total:128 +1.9456=129.9456 grams. So approximately 129.95 grams.

But the option G is 130.08. Hmm, that's a little confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of n.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects me to use R=0.08206, and perhaps round more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise calculation steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using moles as n=PV/(RT) without approximations, and then carry more decimals.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute n as:

n= (10 *10)/(0.0821 *300) =100/(24.63) =4.0608... mol.

So, 4.0608 mol ×32 g/mol= 129.9456 g.

So, 129.9456 grams, which is approximately 130 grams.

Looking at the options, option G is 130.08 grams. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the molar mass. Wait, oxygen is O2, which is 32 g/mol, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 4.0608 ×32.

Wait, 4.0608 ×32.

Let me compute 4 ×32=128.

0.0608 ×32: 0.06 ×32=1.92; 0.0008 ×32=0.0256.

So 1.92 +0.0256=1.9456.

So 128 +1.9456=129.9456 grams, which is 129.95 grams. So about 130 grams.

But the option G is 130.08, which is 130.08 grams. So perhaps there's a more precise calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute 100/(24.63) more accurately.

Let me compute 100 divided by 24.63.

24.63 ×4=98.52.

Subtract from 100: 1.48.

Bring down a zero: 14.8.

24.63 goes into 14.8 0 times. So 0.

Bring down another zero: 148.0.

24.63 ×6=147.78.

So 6 → subtract 147.78 from 148 → 0.22.

Bring down a zero: 2.2.

24.63 goes into 2.2 0 times.

Bring down another zero: 22.0.

24.63 goes into 22.0 0 times.

Bring down another zero: 220.

24.63 ×8=197.04 → 197.04.

220-197.04=22.96.

Bring down a zero: 229.6.

24.63 ×9=221.67.

229.6-221.67=7.93.

Bring down a zero: 79.3.

24.63 ×3=73.89.

79.3-73.89=5.41.

Bring down a zero:54.1.

24.63 ×2=49.26.

54.1-49.26=4.84.

So putting it all together, the division of 100/24.63 gives:

4. (4.0608 approx)

Wait, let me line it up:

24.63 | 100.000000

4 ×24.63=98.52 → subtract, remainder 1.48.

Bring down 0 →14.8 → 0. So 4.0

Bring down 0 →148 →6 ×24.63=147.78 → remainder 0.22.

Bring down 0 →2.20 →0.

Bring down 0 →22.00 →0.

Bring down 0 →220 →8 ×24.63=197.04 → remainder 22.96.

Bring down 0 →229.6 →9 ×24.63=221.67 → remainder 7.93.

Bring down 0 →79.3 →3 ×24.63=73.89 → remainder 5.41.

Bring down 0 →54.1 →2 ×24.63=49.26 → remainder 4.84.

So the decimal expansion is 4.060803... So 4.060803 approximately.

So n=4.060803 moles.

Then mass m=4.060803 ×32.

Compute 4 ×32=128.

0.060803 ×32.

0.06 ×32=1.92.

0.000803 ×32=0.025696.

So 1.92 +0.025696=1.945696.

Adding to 128 gives 128 +1.945696=129.945696 grams.

So about 129.95 grams. So 130.0 grams when rounded to two decimal places.

But the option G is 130.08, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Or perhaps the problem used a different value for R.

Wait, maybe I should try with R=0.08206 instead of 0.0821.

n=100/(0.08206 *300) =100/(24.618)= approx?

24.618 ×4=98.472 → 100-98.472=1.528.

1.528 /24.618 ≈0.06207.

So n≈4.06207 mol.

Then m=4.06207 ×32= ?

4 ×32=128.

0.06207 ×32=1.98624.

So total is 128 +1.98624=129.98624 grams, which is approximately 129.99 grams, or 130.0 grams.

Still, that's about 130. So the closest option is G: 130.08 grams, but my calculation gives around 130. So why is option G 130.08?

Wait, perhaps I should check the exact calculation using more precise steps.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't use R=0.0821 but instead uses R=0.082057, which is the more precise value. Let me compute with that.

R=0.082057 L·atm/(mol·K).

n= (10 ×10) / (0.082057 ×300) =100/(24.6171)= approx 4.0622 mol.

So 4.0622 ×32= ?

4 ×32=128.

0.0622 ×32=1.9904.

Total=128 +1.9904=129.9904 grams, which is 129.99 grams.

Wait, that's 129.99, which is 130.0 when rounded to one decimal place.

But the option G is 130.08, which is 0.09 grams higher. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects rounding to two decimal places, but even then, 129.99 rounds to 130.00.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of n.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I misread the volume. The volume is 10 liters, right? So 10 L, yes.

Wait another approach: use R with more precise value and calculate n.

n = (10 atm *10 L) / (0.082057 L·atm/mol·K *300 K
