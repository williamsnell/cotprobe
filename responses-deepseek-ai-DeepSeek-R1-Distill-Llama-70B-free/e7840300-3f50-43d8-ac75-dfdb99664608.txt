Okay, so I've got this problem here about John Wilson retiring and how much he and his wife receive each month. Hmm, I think this is related to Social Security benefits because that's usually what people get when they retire. Let me try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the question says John retired at 62 with average yearly earnings of $5,400. His wife was also 62 when he retired. I need to find out their monthly payment. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Wait, I remember that Social Security benefits are calculated based on your earnings record, and the amount you get depends on your Primary Insurance Amount (PIA). The PIA is the benefit you receive at your full retirement age. But since John is retiring at 62, which is earlier than the full retirement age, his benefits would be reduced. Also, his wife would receive spousal benefits based on his earnings.

Let me think about how Social Security works. The PIA is calculated using your average indexed monthly earnings (AIME), which are adjusted for inflation. Then, a formula applies to the AIME to get the PIA. The formula is 90% of the first $926 of the AIME, plus 32% of the amount between $926 and $5,785, plus 15% of the amount over $5,785. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact numbers here because the dollar amounts might change each year. But I think for this problem, maybe the numbers are simplified.

Wait, but John's average yearly earnings are $5,400. So his yearly earnings are $5,400. I think that's the average, so maybe that's his AIME. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, AIME is the average of the highest 35 years of earnings, indexed. But perhaps for this problem, we can take his average yearly earnings as $5,400, so maybe his monthly would be around $5,400 divided by 12, which is $450 per month.

Wait, but Social Security uses a different method. Let me think again. So the Primary Insurance Amount is calculated as:

PIA = 0.9 * (AIME up to the first bend point) + 0.32 * (AIME between first and second bend points) + 0.15 * (AIME above the second bend point).

But I'm not exactly sure about the bend points for the year this problem is referring to. Let's say for this example, the bend points are at $926 and $5,785 as I thought earlier.

So John's AIME is calculated from his average yearly earnings. Let's see, if he made $5,400 a year on average, that's $5,400 divided by 12, which is $450 per month.

Wait, but I think the AIME is calculated by taking the average of the highest 35 years of indexed earnings. But maybe in this problem, they're simplifying it by just using $5,400 as the average, so the AIME would be $5,400/12 = $450.

Wait, but if his AIME is $450, then let's apply the PIA formula. So first, calculate each part:

First bend point: $926. So $450 is less than that, right? Wait, no, $450 is lower than $926. So the PIA would be 90% of $450, since it's all below the first bend point.

Wait wait, no, because if the AIME is $450, then the first bracket is up to $926, but since $450 is less than that, the entire amount would be multiplied by 0.9.

So PIA = 0.9 * 450 = $405 per month.

Wait, but he's retiring at 62, which is before his full retirement age. So his benefits will be reduced. How much is the reduction? I think for each year you retire before full retirement age, the benefit is reduced by 5/9 of 1% per month. Or wait, maybe it's a fixed percentage for each year.

Wait, more accurately, if the full retirement age is 66, then retiring at 62 would mean 48 months early. The reduction is 5/9 of 1% for each of the first 36 months, and 5% for each month beyond 36, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, I think the reduction is 0.556% per month for each month before full retirement age, up to 36 months. So for 48 months early, the first 36 months would be reduced by 0.556% each, and the remaining 12 months by 0.4167% each.

Wait, but maybe it's simpler. I've heard that retiring at 62 leads to a 30% reduction in benefits compared to full retirement. Wait, let me think: for each year before full retirement, you lose a certain percentage. For someone with a full retirement age of 66, retiring at 62 would mean 4 years early. I think the reduction is 20% for 60 months, so 20% less? Or maybe 25%? Wait, perhaps 30%? I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's a 25% reduction for someone retiring at 62 when the full retirement age is 66.

Wait, wait, I think the formula is that for each year before full retirement age, you lose 5/9 of 1% per month. So for each year, that's 12 months, so 12*(5/9)% per year. So 12*(5/9) = 60/9 = 6.666...%, so about 6.666% per year. So for 4 years, that would be 4*6.666 = 26.666% reduction.

So if the PIA is $405, then the reduced amount would be 405*(1 - 0.26666) = 405*(0.73333) ≈ 405 * 0.7333 ≈ let's see, 405 * 0.7 is 283.5, and 405 * 0.0333 is around 13.5, so total around 297. So maybe around $297 per month.

But wait, that's just for John. But the question says "how much do the Wilsons receive each month?" So does that mean both John and his wife?

Because when a spouse retires, they can receive spousal benefits. The wife, if she's 62 and hasn't worked or hasn't earned much, would get 50% of John's PIA, but also reduced because she's taking it early.

Wait, but John's PIA is $405, so without reduction, the spousal benefit would be half of that, which is $202.50. But since she's also taking it at 62, her benefit would be reduced as well.

Wait, but the spousal benefit reduction is calculated the same way as the worker's benefit. So if she starts receiving at 62, her benefit is reduced by the same percentage as John's.

Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, they are both receiving their full spousal benefits without reduction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem states that John's average yearly earnings are $5,400. So perhaps his Social Security benefit is based on that. Maybe we can compute his monthly benefit as half of that, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is using a simplified formula where the monthly benefit is 1/12 of the average yearly earnings. But that would be $5,400 / 12 = $450 per month. But that doesn't account for any reductions or spousal benefits.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different calculation. I've heard that Social Security uses 35 highest earning years. If John's average is $5,400 per year, then over 35 years, his total would be 35 * 5,400 = let's see, 35*5,000 is 175,000, plus 35*400=14,000, so total 189,000. Then, the average monthly earnings would be 189,000 divided by 35 years, which is 5,400 per year, so 5,400/12 = 450 per month, same as before.

So PIA would be 90% of 450, which is 405. Then, reduced by 26.666% for retiring at 62, giving John's benefit as 405 * 0.7333 ≈ 297.

Now, his wife would get half of John's PIA, which is 202.50, but also reduced by the same percentage. So 202.50 * 0.7333 ≈ 148.50.

Wait, but maybe the spousal benefit isn't reduced if the wife is taking it at her own full retirement age. Wait, but in this case, she's 62, so she's also taking it early, so her benefit would be reduced as well.

So John's benefit is about $297, and his wife's is about $148.50. Together, that's $297 + $148.50 = $445.50 per month. Hmm, but none of the options are exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: $262.15

B: $150.25

C: $475.00

D: $294.50

E: $410.80

F: $345.70

G: $94.00

H: $5400

I: $200.50

J: $125.00

Hmm, none of these match $445.50. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is different. Maybe the problem assumes that both John and his wife receive their own benefits, not spousal. But the question says John's wife was 62 when he retired. So perhaps she didn't work, so she's only getting spousal benefits.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that John's retirement benefit is based on his average earnings, and his wife gets half of that. Let me see.

If John's average yearly earnings are $5,400, then perhaps his monthly benefit is calculated as some percentage of that. But I'm not sure. Maybe the problem is using the average earnings as the basis for the benefit, without considering the PIA calculation. So, perhaps it's 1/12 of $5,400, which is $450, but reduced by 25% for taking it at 62, so 450 * 0.75 = 337.50. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is that John's benefit is 1.5% of his average earnings times the number of years he worked. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a simplified formula where the monthly benefit is (average earnings × 35 years) / 12. Let's see: 5,400 × 35 = 189,000. 189,000 / 12 = 15,750. That's way too high, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to both John and his wife receiving benefits, so their total would be twice the individual benefit. If John's benefit is $294.50 (option D), then together they'd get $589, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the options are showing individual benefits, so the total would be double, but that's not one of the options either.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the PIA. Let me try again. If the AIME is $450, then PIA is 0.9 × 450 = 405. Correct. Then, the reduction for retiring at 62 is 26.666%, so 405 × 0.7333 ≈ 297. So John gets $297 per month. His wife gets half of his PIA, which is 202.50, reduced by the same 26.666%, so 202.50 × 0.7333 ≈ 148.50. So together, 297 + 148.50 = 445.50. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options, option E is $410.80, which is close but not exact. Maybe I'm miscalculating the reduction. Let me check the exact reduction percentage.

I think the reduction for retiring at 62 when the full retirement age is 66 is calculated as follows: for each month before full retirement, the benefit is reduced by 5/9 of 1% per month for the first 36 months, and 5% per month for the months beyond that. So, 48 months early would mean 36 months at 5/9% and 12 months at 5%. 

So, the total reduction would be (36*(5/9) + 12*5)%. Let's compute that:

36*(5/9) = 20%.

12*5 = 60%.

So total reduction is 20% + 60% = 80%? Wait, that can't be right because that would leave only 20% of the benefit, which is too low.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The reduction is applied per month, so each month before FRA reduces the benefit by a certain percentage. So for each of the first 36 months, you lose 5/9 of 1%, which is approximately 0.5555% per month. Then, for each month beyond 36, you lose 5% per month.

So for 48 months early:

First 36 months: 36 * 0.5555% = 20%.

Next 12 months: 12 * 5% = 60%.

Total reduction: 20% + 60% = 80%.

Wait, that would mean the benefit is reduced by 80%, leaving 20% of the PIA. So if PIA is $405, 20% of that is $81, which is way too low. That can't be right because the options don't have such a low number.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. I think the correct way is that for each year before FRA, the benefit is reduced by 5/9 of 1% times the number of months, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction is 5/9 of 1% per month for the first 36 months, which would be 36 * (5/9)% = 20%. Then, for the remaining months beyond 36, it's 5% per month. So if someone retires 48 months early, that's 36 + 12 months.

So reduction would be 20% + (12 * 5%) = 20% + 60% = 80%. Again, that's an 80% reduction, which seems too high.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check a different approach. I've heard that retiring at 62 when the FRA is 66 leads to a 25% reduction in benefits. So maybe the reduction is 25%, not 26.666%. So 405 * 0.75 = 303.75.

Then the wife's benefit would be 202.50 * 0.75 = 151.875. So together, 303.75 + 151.875 = 455.625, which is around $455.63. But that's still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that John's wife is receiving half of his reduced benefit, not half of his PIA. So if John's benefit is reduced to 75% of his PIA, then his wife gets half of that reduced amount.

So John's reduced benefit: 405 * 0.75 = 303.75. Wife's benefit: 303.75 / 2 = 151.875. So together, 303.75 + 151.875 = 455.625, same as before.

Still not matching the options. Maybe the problem is using a different calculation method. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the average earnings directly without applying the PIA formula. So if John earned $5,400 per year, his monthly benefit is 5,400 / 12 = 450. Then, reduced by 25% for retiring at 62: 450 * 0.75 = 337.50. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is treating John's and his wife's benefits as separate, each receiving half of his earnings. So 5,400 / 2 = 2,700 per year each, so 225 per month each. But that would be 450 total, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the wife receives 50% of John's benefit. So if John's benefit is 337.50, then the wife gets 168.75, totaling 506.25. Still not matching.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options again. Option D is $294.50. That's close to my earlier calculation of $297. Maybe the exact reduction leads to $294.50. Let me check that.

If John's PIA is 405, and the reduction is 26.666%, then 405 * 0.7333 = 405 * (11/15) = (405 * 11) / 15 = 4455 / 15 = 297. So that's $297. But option D is $294.50, which is close but not exact. Maybe the actual calculation uses more precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different PIA calculation. Let me think again about the PIA formula. Maybe the bend points are different. Wait, perhaps the first bend point is lower. Let me check the 2023 bend points. Oh wait, maybe the problem is using the 2023 figures where the first bend point is $1,024, and the second is $6,172.

Wait, if John's AIME is $450, which is below $1,024, then PIA would be 90% of 450, which is 405, same as before.

But perhaps the problem uses a different method, such as taking 80% of the average earnings. So 5,400 * 0.8 = 4,320 per year, divided by 12 is 360 per month. But that's not an option either.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem uses a flat rate, such as 1.5% of earnings times the number of years worked. So 1.5% * 35 years = 52.5% of average earnings. So 5,400 * 0.525 = 2,835 per year, divided by 12 is 236.25 per month. That's not an option either.

Hmm, I'm not getting closer. Let me try to think of the options given. Option D is $294.50, which is close to my calculation of John's reduced benefit as $297. If that's the case, maybe the question is only asking about John's benefit, not both of them.
