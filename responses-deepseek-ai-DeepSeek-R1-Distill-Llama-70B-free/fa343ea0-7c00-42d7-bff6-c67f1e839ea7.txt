Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the energy of a photon with a given wavelength. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that photons have energy related to their wavelength. Let me think about the formula I need.

Oh right, the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. Wait, what's the value of h and c again? Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. I think those are the right numbers.

The wavelength given is 100 picometers. Oh wait, picometers are 1e-12 meters. So λ = 100 pm = 100 x 10^-12 m, which is 1e-10 meters. Right, so that's 1e-10 m.

Plugging the numbers into the equation, E = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3.0e8 m/s) / (1e-10 m). Let me calculate that step by step.

First, multiply h and c. 6.626e-34 * 3.0e8 = ... 6.626 * 3 is about 19.878, and the exponents multiply as 10^-34 * 10^8 = 10^(-34+8) = 10^-26. So that gives 19.878e-26 J·m. Wait, no, the units would be J·m because the s in the denominator cancels with the m/s's seconds, leaving m.

Wait, let me correct that. The units: h is J·s, c is m/s. So when you multiply h*c, the seconds cancel out, leaving J·m. So yes, that's correct.

Then divide by λ, which is 1e-10 m. So the calculation is (19.878e-26 J·m) / (1e-10 m). The meters cancel, leaving J. The exponents: 1e-26 divided by 1e-10 is 1e-16, right? So 19.878e-26 / 1e-10 = 19.878e-16 J.

Wait, 19.878e-16 J is the same as 1.9878e-15 J because 19.878e-16 is 1.9878 times 10^-15. So approximately 2.0e-15 J, which is 2.0 x 10^-15 J.

Looking at the options, let me see. Option E is 2e-15 J, which matches my calculation. Wait, the options are labeled A to J. So let's check the list.

Options:

A:4e-15 J

B:1.2e-15

C:5e-15

D:3.5e-15

E:2e-15 J

F:1.5e-15

G:1.0e-15

H:0.5e-15

I:3e-15

J:2.5e-15

So the correct answer should be E. But wait, let me double-check my calculation because sometimes I might make a mistake with exponents.

Let me recalculate:

h=6.626e-34

c=3e8

λ=1e-10 m.

E=6.626e-34 *3e8 / 1e-10.

Multiply 6.626e-34 and 3e8: 6.626 *3 is 19.878, and 1e-34 *1e8 is 1e-26. So 19.878e-26.

Divide by 1e-10: 19.878e-26 /1e-10 = 19.878e-16. Oh wait, no, 1e-26 divided by 1e-10 is 1e-16, yes. So 19.878e-16 is 1.9878e-15, which is approximately 2.0e-15 J.

So E is correct. But wait, looking at the options, option E is written as 2 10^-15 J, so yeah. So the answer should be E.

To calculate the energy of a photon with a wavelength of 100 pm, we use the formula:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 100 \, \text{pm} = 100 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{m} = 1.0 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (3.0 \times 10^8)}{1.0 \times 10^{-10}}
\]

First, calculate \( h \cdot c \):

\[
6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 3.0 \times 10^8 = 19.878 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J·m}
\]

Now divide by \( \lambda = 1.0 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \):

\[
E = \frac{19.878 \times 10^{-26}}{1.0 \times 10^{-10}} = 19.878 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J}
\]

Convert \( 19.878 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J} \) to a simpler form:

\[
19.878 \times 10^{-16} = 1.9878 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J} \approx 2.0 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the energy of the photon is approximately \( 2.0 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J} \).

From the given options:

- **A:** \( 4 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J} \)
- **B:** \( 1.2 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J} \)
- **C:** \( 5 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J} \)
- **D:** \( 3.5 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J} \)
- **E:** \( 2 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J} \)
- **F:** \( 1.5 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J} \)
- **G:** \( 1.0 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J} \)
- **H:** \( 0.5 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J} \)
- **I:** \( 3 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J} \)
- **J:** \( 2.5 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J} \)

The correct answer is **E: \( 2 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J} \)**.
