Okay, so I have this calculus problem here, and I need to find the inflection point of the function f(x) = (10 ln(x))/x². Hmm, inflection points are where the concavity of the function changes, right? That happens when the second derivative equals zero and changes sign. 

Alright, so first, I should find the first derivative of f(x), and then the second derivative. Let me start by writing down the function: f(x) = 10 ln(x) / x². 

To find the first derivative, f'(x), I can use the quotient rule. The quotient rule is (u'v - uv') / v², where u is the numerator and v is the denominator. So, u = 10 ln(x), so u' would be 10*(1/x). The denominator v is x², so v' is 2x. 

Putting it together, f'(x) = [ (10/x * x²) - (10 ln(x) * 2x) ] / (x²)^2. Let me simplify that. The numerator becomes 10x - 20x ln(x), and the denominator is x⁴. So f'(x) = (10x - 20x ln(x)) / x⁴. I can factor out 10x in the numerator: 10x(1 - 2 ln(x)) / x^4. Then, simplify the x terms: 10(1 - 2 ln(x)) / x³. So f'(x) = [10(1 - 2 ln(x))] / x³.

Now, I need the second derivative, f''(x). Let me take the derivative of f'(x). So f'(x) is 10(1 - 2 ln(x)) times x^(-3). I'll use the product rule here. Let me denote u = 10(1-2 ln x) and v = x^(-3). Then u' is 10*(0 - 2*(1/x)) = -20/x. And v' is -3x^(-4).

So, f''(x) = u'v + uv'. Let's compute each part. u'v is (-20/x) * x^(-3) = -20 x^(-4) = -20 / x^4. Then, uv' is 10(1-2 ln x) * (-3 x^(-4)) )= -30 (1-2 ln x) / x^4.

So f''(x) is the sum of these two terms: (-20/x^4) + (-30 (1-2 ln x)/x^4). Let me combine them over a common denominator. So:

f''(x) = [ -20 - 30(1 - 2 ln x) ] / x^4.

Let me expand the numerator: -20 -30 +60 ln x. Combine the constants: -50 + 60 ln x. So f''(x) = (60 ln x -50) / x^4.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the signs. Let me check again. The second term is -30 (1 - 2 ln x) which is -30 +60 ln x. So when I add -20 (from the first term), that's -50 +60 ln x. So that's correct.

So f''(x) = (60 ln x - 50) / x^4.

Now, to find inflection points, set f''(x) = 0. So:

60 ln x -50 = 0.

Solving for x: 60 ln x = 50 → ln x = 50/60 → ln x = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

So x = e^(5/6). Let's compute that. e^5 is about 148.413, but wait, 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. So e^0.8333 is approximately 2.300 something. Let me compute it more accurately. Hmm, e^0.8 is about 2.2255, and e^0.8333 is slightly higher. Let me calculate it using a calculator approach. Let's see, 0.8333 is 5/6. So e^(5/6) is approximately 2.319. Wait, but looking at the answer options, option J is 2.301, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, I remember that ln(2) is about 0.693, ln(3) is around 1.0986. So e^0.8333 is between e^0.693 (which is 2) and e^1.0986 (which is 3). Let me get a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use Taylor's expansion to compute e^(5/6). But maybe a quicker way is to use known values. 5/6 is about 0.833333.

Let me compute e^0.833333. Let me think: e^0.8 is about 2.2255, as I thought. e^0.833333 is e^(0.8 + 0.033333) = e^0.8 * e^(0.033333). Since e^0.033333 is approximately 1 + 0.033333 + (0.033333)^2/2 ≈ 1 + 0.033333 + 0.000555 ≈ 1.033888.

So 2.2255 * 1.033888 ≈ 2.2255 * 1.0339.

Let me compute that: 2.2255 * 1 is 2.2255, 2.2255 * 0.03 is 0.066765, 2.2255 *0.0039 is approx 0.00868. So adding them together: 2.2255 + 0.066765 = 2.292265, plus 0.00868 is about 2.3009. So e^(5/6) is approximately 2.3009.

Looking at the options, option J is 2.301, which matches. So the inflection point is at x ≈ 2.301.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let's double-check the second derivative.

f(x) = 10 ln x / x².

First derivative: f'(x) = [10*(1/x) * x² - 10 ln x * 2x ] / x^4.

Which is [10x - 20x ln x]/x^4 = 10(x - 2x ln x)/x^4 = 10(1 - 2 ln x)/x³.

Yes, that's correct.

Then f''(x): Let's differentiate 10(1-2 ln x) * x^(-3).

Using product rule: 10 [ d/dx (1-2 ln x) * x^(-3) + (1-2 ln x) * d/dx x^(-3) ].

d/dx (1-2 ln x) is -2/x.

d/dx x^(-3) is -3 x^(-4).

So f''(x) = 10 [ (-2/x)*x^(-3) + (1-2 ln x)*(-3 x^(-4)) ) ].

Simplify each term:

-2/x * x^(-3) = -2 x^(-4) = -2/x^4.

(1-2 ln x)*(-3 x^(-4)) = -3(1-2 ln x)/x^4.

So f''(x) =10 [ (-2/x^4) -3(1-2 ln x)/x^4 ) ].

Factor out 1/x^4:

10 [ (-2 -3(1-2 ln x) ) /x^4 ].

Compute numerator: -2 -3 +6 ln x = (-5) +6 ln x.

So f''(x) =10 (6 ln x -5 ) /x^4.

Wait, wait a minute. Earlier I thought the numerator was 60 ln x -50, but now it's 6 ln x -5, multiplied by 10, so 60 ln x -50. So that's correct. So when I set f''(x)=0, 60 ln x -50=0 → ln x=50/60=5/6. So x=e^(5/6)= approx 2.301.

Which is option J.

So the inflection point is at x=2.301, which is option J.

To find the inflection point of the function \( f(x) = \frac{10 \ln(x)}{x^2} \), we need to determine where the second derivative \( f''(x) \) equals zero and changes sign. 

First, we compute the first derivative \( f'(x) \) using the quotient rule. Let \( u = 10 \ln(x) \) and \( v = x^2 \). Then \( u' = \frac{10}{x} \) and \( v' = 2x \). Applying the quotient rule:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2} = \frac{\frac{10}{x} \cdot x^2 - 10 \ln(x) \cdot 2x}{x^4} = \frac{10x - 20x \ln(x)}{x^4}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{10(1 - 2 \ln(x))}{x^3}.
\]

Next, we compute the second derivative \( f''(x) \) using the product rule. Let \( u = 10(1 - 2 \ln(x)) \) and \( v = x^{-3} \). Then \( u' = -\frac{20}{x} \) and \( v' = -3x^{-4} \). Applying the product rule:

\[
f''(x) = u'v + uv' = \left(-\frac{20}{x}\right)x^{-3} + 10(1 - 2 \ln(x))(-3x^{-4}).
\]

Simplifying each term:

\[
f''(x) = -\frac{20}{x^4} - \frac{30(1 - 2 \ln(x))}{x^4}.
\]

Combining over a common denominator:

\[
f''(x) = \frac{-20 - 30(1 - 2 \ln(x))}{x^4}.
\]

Expanding the numerator:

\[
f''(x) = \frac{-20 - 30 + 60 \ln(x)}{x^4} = \frac{60 \ln(x) - 50}{x^4}.
\]

To find the inflection point, set \( f''(x) = 0 \):

\[
60 \ln(x) - 50 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \ln(x) = \frac{50}{60} = \frac{5}{6}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = e^{5/6}.
\]

Using approximations, \( e^{5/6} \approx 2.301 \). Comparing this to the given options, the closest match is option \( J: 2.301 \).

Thus, the inflection point of \( f(x) \) is at \( x \approx 2.301 \).
