Okay, so I've got this problem here about stock turnover rates. Hmm, I remember that stock turnover, or inventory turnover, is a measure of how many times inventory is sold and replaced in a given period. It's important because a high turnover might mean you're selling a lot, but maybe not holding too much stock, whereas low turnover could indicate slow-selling items.

The question gives me data about a business's inventory at the start and end of the year, along with sales data. I need to find the stockturn rates at cost, selling price, and number of units. The options are A to J, each with different numbers.

Let me read the data again to make sure I get all the numbers right.

At the start of the year, the inventory was 90,000 items. The cost was $60,000, and the selling price was $80,000. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Wait, no, maybe it's the total cost for the 90k items is $60,000? Or maybe the per-item cost? Hmm, no, wait. Let me think.

Wait, no, the problem probably says that the beginning inventory consisted of 90k items costing $60k total, and selling price (maybe total) would be $80k. Similarly, the end inventory is 70k items costing $90k, selling for $120k. Then, during the year, 360k items were sold. Those cost $300k, and net sales were $380k.

Wait, so for the year, the cost of goods sold is $300k, and sales are $380k. The question is about calculating the stock turn rates.

Stock turnover is usually calculated as cost of goods sold divided by average inventory at cost. Similarly, for selling price, it's sales divided by average inventory at selling price, and for units, it's units sold divided by average units in inventory.

So, I think there are three different turnover ratios here: one based on cost, one on selling price, and one on units.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, calculate the average inventory in terms of cost, selling price, and units.

For cost-based average inventory:

Beginning inventory cost: $60,000.

Ending inventory cost: $90,000.

Average inventory cost = (60,000 + 90,000) / 2 = 150,000 / 2 = $75,000.

Then, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is $300,000.

So, cost-based stock turn = COGS / average inventory cost = 300,000 /75,000 = 4.0.

Wait wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, COGS is $300,000? Or wait, the problem says that during the year, 360,000 items were sold which cost $300,000. So yes, COGS is $300k.

So cost-based turnover is 300,000 /75,000 = 4.0.

Alright, that's one part.

Next, the selling price-based stock turn. For this, I think we need to calculate the average inventory at selling price and then divide the net sales by that.

Beginning inventory selling price: $80,000.

Ending inventory selling price: $120,000.

So average selling price inventory = (80,000 + 120,000)/2 = 200,000 /2 = $100,000.

Net sales for the year are $380,000.

So selling price-based stock turn = 380,000 /100,000 = 3.8.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe it's the average of the beginning and ending selling prices, but in terms of quantities.

Wait, no, the average inventory in terms of selling price would be the same as taking the average of the total value of inventory at selling price at the start and end. So yes, (80k +120k)/2 = 100k.

So turnover is 380k /100k = 3.8.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternative approach: perhaps selling price per unit?

Wait, the beginning inventory's selling price is $80,000 for 90,000 units. So per unit, that's 80,000 /90,000 â‰ˆ $0.89 per item. Similarly, the ending is 120,000 for 70,000 units, which is about $1.71 per unit. But maybe that's complicating it.

Alternatively, maybe the selling price-based turnover is (net sales) / (average inventory value at selling price). So that's correct as 380,000 /100,000 = 3.8.

Wait, but in the options, I don't see 3.8 for selling price. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3.5,4.0,4.5

Option B: 3.5,3.5,5.0

Option C:4.5,4.2,3.8

Option D:5.0,4.5,3.5

Option E:4.0,4.0,4.0

Option F:4.2,3.5,3.8

Option G:4.0,3.8,4.5

Option H:3.8,4.0,3.5

Option I:4.5,3.8,4.0

Option J:3.0,4.2,4.2

Hmm, so the selling price-based is 3.8, which appears in options C, F, H, and I.

Wait, but let's proceed to the third part: number of units.

Units sold during the year: 360,000 items.

Average units in inventory: (90,000 +70,000)/2 = 160,000 / 2 =80,000.

So units-based stock turn = 360,000 /80,000 =4.5.

Wait, that's 4.5 units.

So putting it all together:

Cost-based: 4.0

Selling price-based:3.8

Units-based:4.5

Wait, but looking at the options, none of the options have 4.0, 3.8, 4.5 in the same order. Wait, let me check the order of the question. The question asks for the stockturn rates at cost, selling price, and number of units. So the order would be cost, selling price, units.

So my calculations are 4.0 (cost), 3.8 (selling), 4.5 (units).

Looking at the options, is there an option that matches 4.0, 3.8, 4.5?

Looking again:

Option G: 4.0, 3.8,4.5. Yes, that's option G.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Average cost inventory: (60k +90k)/2 =75k. COGS is 300k. 300/75=4. Correct.

Average selling price inventory: (80k +120k)/2=100k. Sales 380k. 380/100 =3.8.

Units: (90k +70k)/2=80k. Units sold 360k. 360/80=4.5.

So yes, 4.0, 3.8, 4.5.

Looking for that in the options. Option G is 4.0,3.8,4.5.

So option G would be the answer.

Wait, but let me look back at the options to confirm:

Option G:4.0, 3.8,4.5. Correct.

So the answer should be G.

To calculate the stockturn rates at cost, selling price, and number of units, the following steps were taken:

1. **Cost-Based Stockturn Rate**:  
   - Beginning inventory cost: $60,000  
   - Ending inventory cost: $90,000  
   - Average inventory cost: \((60,000 + 90,000) / 2 = 75,000\)  
   - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): $300,000  
   - Stockturn rate at cost: \(300,000 / 75,000 = 4.0\).

2. **Selling Price-Based Stockturn Rate**:  
   - Beginning inventory selling price: $80,000  
   - Ending inventory selling price: $120,000  
   - Average inventory selling price: \((80,000 + 120,000) / 2 = 100,000\)  
   - Net sales: $380,000  
   - Stockturn rate at selling price: \(380,000 / 100,000 = 3.8\).

3. **Units-Based Stockturn Rate**:  
   - Beginning inventory units: 90,000  
   - Ending inventory units: 70,000  
   - Average inventory units: \((90,000 + 70,000) / 2 = 80,000\)  
   - Units sold: 360,000  
   - Stockturn rate at units: \(360,000 / 80,000 = 4.5\).

Thus, the stockturn rates are **4.0 (cost), 3.8 (selling price), and 4.5 (units)**. Comparing these results to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**G: 4.0, 3.8, 4.5**.
