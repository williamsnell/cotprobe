Okay, so I have this question about which country invested the largest fraction of its GDP in renewable energy in 2015. The options are A through J, each a different country. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

First, I remember that GDP investment in renewable energy isn't just about the total amount spent but the percentage relative to the country's economy. So a country with a smaller GDP might have a higher percentage even if the absolute investment is lower.

I think about the big players in renewable energy. China comes to mind because I've heard they invest a lot in solar and wind. But wait, the question is about the fraction of GDP, not the absolute amount. So maybe a smaller country?

I recall that some European countries are big on renewables. Germany has the Energiewende policy, which is a big shift to renewables. But I'm not sure how that translates to percentage of GDP. I think Germany's economy is pretty large, so maybe the fraction isn't the highest.

Then there's Brazil. I remember Brazil uses a lot of hydroelectric power, which is renewable. But I'm not sure if their investment in new renewables was high in 2015. Plus, their GDP is substantial.

What about Canada? They have a lot of hydro too, but I'm not certain about their investment relative to GDP. Australia has a lot of sun, so maybe they invest in solar, but I don't think they were leading in 2015.

Chile is an interesting option. I've heard that Chile has made significant investments in solar energy, especially in the Atacama desert, which has high solar potential. But I'm not sure how much that translates to in terms of GDP percentage.

South Africa? They have some renewable projects, but I don't recall them leading in this aspect.

Wait, I think there's something about Costa Rica or Uruguay being leaders in renewables, but they're not among the options. So maybe the answer is Chile or Germany.

Another angle: I remember reading that in 2015, some countries were pushing hard to meet their Paris Agreement targets early. Maybe Chile had ambitious targets and invested a larger portion of their GDP.

Alternatively, Germany's large economy might mean that even if they invest a lot, the percentage of GDP isn't the highest. China's economy is huge, so their investment, while large in absolute terms, might not be the highest fraction.

I'm trying to think of any reports or data from that time. There was a report by the International Energy Agency or maybe the REN21 Network that tracks renewable energy investments.

Wait, I think I read that in 2015, Chile had one of the highest percentages of GDP invested in renewables. They were pushing solar and wind projects heavily because of high electricity demand and good natural resources.

So putting it all together, I think the answer might be Chile, which is option C. But I'm not 100% sure. Another possibility is Germany, but I'm more inclined towards Chile.

The question asks which country invested the largest fraction of its GDP in renewable energy in 2015. To determine this, it's important to consider both the absolute investment and the percentage relative to GDP, as smaller economies might have higher percentages despite lower absolute investments.

- **China (A)**: A major investor in renewables, but due to its large GDP, the fraction might not be the highest.
- **India (B)**: Significant investments, but the fraction of GDP is unclear.
- **Chile (C)**: Known for substantial investments in solar energy, particularly in the Atacama Desert, suggesting a high fraction of GDP.
- **United States (D)**: A large economy, so the fraction might not be the highest.
- **Japan (E)**: Advanced in technology but not noted for the highest GDP fraction in renewables.
- **Canada (F)**: Relies heavily on hydroelectric power but unclear on the fraction.
- **Germany (G)**: A leader in renewables with its Energiewende policy, but its large GDP might lower the fraction.
- **Australia (H)**: Strong in solar potential but not a leader in GDP fraction.
- **South Africa (I)**: Some renewable projects but not prominent in this aspect.
- **Brazil (J)**: Relies on hydroelectric power but unclear on new investments.

Given the analysis, Chile (C) stands out as a likely candidate due to its significant focus on solar and wind projects relative to its GDP.

Answer: C
