Alright, so I've got this problem here about finding the determinant of a linear transformation D(f) = f' on the space V spanned by cos(2x) and sin(2x). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with linear transformations, especially on function spaces, it's helpful to represent the transformation as a matrix with respect to a basis. Since V is spanned by cos(2x) and sin(2x), I can use these two functions as my basis vectors. Let's denote the basis as {v1, v2}, where v1 = cos(2x) and v2 = sin(2x).

Now, the transformation D takes a function f and maps it to its derivative f'. So, I need to apply D to each of the basis vectors and see what they look like in terms of the original basis.

Let's start with D(v1) = d/dx [cos(2x)]. The derivative of cos(2x) with respect to x is -2 sin(2x). So, D(v1) = -2 sin(2x). In terms of our basis, that's 0*v1 + (-2)*v2. So, the first column of the matrix representation will be [0, -2]^T.

Next, D(v2) = d/dx [sin(2x)]. The derivative of sin(2x) is 2 cos(2x). So, D(v2) = 2 cos(2x), which is 2*v1 + 0*v2. Therefore, the second column of the matrix will be [2, 0]^T.

Putting these together, the matrix representation of D with respect to the basis {v1, v2} is:

[ 0   2 ]
[ -2  0 ]

Now, to find the determinant of this matrix. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] is ad - bc. Applying that here:

det(D) = (0)(0) - (2)(-2) = 0 - (-4) = 4.

Wait, but looking at the options, 4 is option H. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes determinants can have signs based on orientation or other factors. Let me double-check my calculations.

Matrix:
Row 1: 0, 2
Row 2: -2, 0

Determinant: (0)(0) - (2)(-2) = 0 + 4 = 4. Yep, that seems right. So the determinant should be 4, which is option H.

But wait, I'm recalling that the determinant of the derivative operator on a space spanned by sin and cos might have a determinant related to the coefficient inside the trig function. Since it's 2x, maybe there's a factor involved. Oh, but in this case, I've already accounted for the 2 when taking the derivatives, so the matrix correctly includes those factors. So the determinant is indeed 4.

So, I think the correct answer is H: 4.

To determine the determinant of the linear transformation \( D(f) = f' \) on the space \( V \) spanned by \( \cos(2x) \) and \( \sin(2x) \), we first represent \( D \) as a matrix with respect to the basis \( \{v_1, v_2\} \), where \( v_1 = \cos(2x) \) and \( v_2 = \sin(2x) \).

1. Apply \( D \) to \( v_1 \):  
   \[
   D(v_1) = \frac{d}{dx}[\cos(2x)] = -2\sin(2x) = 0 \cdot v_1 + (-2) \cdot v_2
   \]  
   Thus, the first column of the matrix is \( [0, -2]^T \).

2. Apply \( D \) to \( v_2 \):  
   \[
   D(v_2) = \frac{d}{dx}[\sin(2x)] = 2\cos(2x) = 2 \cdot v_1 + 0 \cdot v_2
   \]  
   Thus, the second column of the matrix is \( [2, 0]^T \).

The matrix representation of \( D \) is:  
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 2 \\
-2 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

3. Compute the determinant of this matrix:  
\[
\text{det}(D) = (0)(0) - (2)(-2) = 0 - (-4) = 4
\]

Thus, the determinant of the linear transformation \( D \) is \( 4 \).
