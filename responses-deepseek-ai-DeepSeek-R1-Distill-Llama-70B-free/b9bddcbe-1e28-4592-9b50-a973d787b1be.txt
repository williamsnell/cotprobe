Okay, so I have this problem here about buying a sofa on an installment plan. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the sofa is valued at $547.50. They're paying 20% down, and the rest is to be paid over 36 months. Oh, and there's a service charge of 20% of the unpaid balance. I need to find the amount of each monthly payment.

Alright, first, the down payment is 20% of the total price. Let me calculate that. 20% of 547.50 is 0.20 * 547.50. Let me do that multiplication. 0.2 times 500 is 100, and 0.2 times 47.50 is 9.50, so together that's 109.50. So the down payment is $109.50.

That leaves the unpaid balance. The total was 547.50, minus the down payment, so 547.50 - 109.50. Let me subtract that. 547.50 minus 100 is 447.50, then minus another 9.50 gives me 438. So the unpaid balance is $438.

Now, the problem says that 20% of this unpaid balance is added as a service charge. So I need to calculate 20% of $438. 0.20 times 438. Let me see, 0.2 * 400 is 80, and 0.2 *38 is 7.6. So 80 +7.6 is 87.6. So the service charge is $87.60.

Wait, but is the service charge added to the unpaid balance, making the new total higher? I think so. So the total amount to be paid over the months is the unpaid balance plus the service charge. So that's 438 + 87.60. Let me add those. 438 plus 80 is 518, plus 7.60 is 525.60. So the total now is $525.60.

This amount is to be paid over 36 months. So each monthly payment would be 525.60 divided by 36. Let me do that division. Hmm, 525.60 รท 36. Maybe I can simplify this. Let's see, 36 times 14 is 504. So 525.60 minus 504 is 21.60. So 14 plus (21.60/36) which is 0.60. So 14.60 per month.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my math again. 36 times 14 is 504. 504 + 21.60 is 525.60. So each month is 14.60 dollars. Looking at the options, option D is $14.60.

Wait another thing, perhaps I should approach it another way. The service charge is 20% of the unpaid balance, which is 438. So 438 * 0.20 = 87.6. Then the total owed becomes 438 + 87.6 = 525.6. Then 525.6 divided by 36 is indeed 14.6. So yes, each payment is $14.60, which is option D.

But let me think again. Sometimes these problems can have different interpretations. Wait, does the service charge apply each month or just once? The problem says 20% of the unpaid balance was added as a service charge, so I think it's a one-time charge. So yes, adding it once to the balance. So I think my calculation is correct.

The sofa is valued at $547.50, with a 20% down payment. Calculating the down payment:

\[
0.20 \times 547.50 = 109.50
\]

The unpaid balance is:

\[
547.50 - 109.50 = 438.00
\]

A service charge of 20% is added to the unpaid balance:

\[
0.20 \times 438.00 = 87.60
\]

The total amount to be paid over 36 months is:

\[
438.00 + 87.60 = 525.60
\]

Each monthly payment is:

\[
\frac{525.60}{36} = 14.60
\]

Thus, the amount of each monthly payment is **$14.60**, which corresponds to option **D**.
