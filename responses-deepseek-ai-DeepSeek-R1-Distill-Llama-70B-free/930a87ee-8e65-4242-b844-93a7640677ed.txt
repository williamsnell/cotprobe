Okay, so I've got this question here about a study by Sprecher, Barbee, and Schwartz from 1995. It's asking what women were more likely to feel after their first intercourse compared to men. The options are A through J, each with different emotions.

Hmm, I remember that research often shows gender differences in emotional responses to first sexual experiences. I think traditionally, men and women might experience different emotions because of societal expectations and cultural norms. 

Wait, I think I've heard that women are more likely to feel negative emotions like regret or guilt after their first time. Maybe because there's more societal pressure on women regarding sexual activity. Men, on the other hand, might feel more positive, like excitement or relief.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option D is "experienced regret," and H is "experienced guilt." I'm trying to recall which one the study found. I think Sprecher's study found that women were more likely to feel regret. Or was it guilt? Maybe both, but which is more specific.

I remember that some studies suggest that women might feel regret because of the social stigma or expectations around losing virginity, while men might feel relief or accomplishment. So, the answer is probably regret, which is option D.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes guilt is tied in with religious or moral beliefs. Maybe that's a factor too. But I think the study pointed more towards regret as the primary emotion for women compared to men.

So I'm leaning towards D: experienced regret.
