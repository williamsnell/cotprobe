Question:

Two cousins took title to real estate as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. The first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. It was later entered as a judgment against the first cousin's interest in the real estate. The first cousin died a year later. The second cousin decided to sell the property, but the mortgagee filed an action to prevent the sale and to enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death. Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin?

Options:

A: Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy.
B: Yes, because the mortgagee has the right to enforce his interest in the property to recover the loan.
C: No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights.
D: No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact.
E: Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.
F: No, because the first cousin's debt did not affect the second cousin's rights to the property.
G: Yes, because the mortgagee has a valid claim to the property due to the first cousin's unpaid loan.
H: Yes, because the first cousin's debt was not settled before his death, hence the property cannot be sold until the debt is settled.
I: No, because the second cousin did not have knowledge of the first cousin's debt before his death.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this joint tenancy question. Let me start by recalling what I know about joint tenancies. Joint tenancy with right of survivorship means that when one tenant dies, the other automatically gets the entire property. So, the surviving tenant owns the whole thing without the deceased's interest going through probate.

In this case, two cousins are joint tenants. The first cousin used his interest as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. Then, a judgment was entered against his interest. Later, the first cousin died, and the second cousin wants to sell the property. But the mortgagee is trying to stop the sale to enforce their interest.

The question is whether the court will enforce the mortgagee's lien against the sale. So, I need to think about what happens to liens on a joint tenancy interest when one tenant dies.

I remember that when a joint tenant mortgages their interest, it affects only their own share. But because of the right of survivorship, when the first cousin dies, the second cousin gets the entire property. But does the mortgagee's lien survive the death?

Wait, I think that when one joint tenant mortgages their interest, the lien attaches to that tenant's interest. But upon death, since the survivorship right takes effect, the lien might be extinguished because the first cousin's interest ends. Alternatively, the lien might still be enforceable against the deceased's share, but since that share ceases to exist upon death, maybe it doesn't apply anymore.

Let me think about the options. Option D says no because the second cousin became sole owner due to survivorship, so the joint tenancy was intact. So, the lien would be extinguished. Option E says yes because the mortgage destroys the tenancy. Hmm, I thought that a mortgage by one tenant doesn't sever the joint tenancy; it just affects that tenant's interest. So the tenancy remains, but the lien is on that one's share.

Wait, but upon death, the first cousin's share goes to the second cousin. So, does the lien attach to the property, making the entire property subject to the lien? Or does the lien only affect the first cousin's interest, which no longer exists after death?

I think that when a joint tenant mortgages their interest, the lien is only on their interest. If the tenant dies, the lien can't attach to the survivor's interest because the deceased's interest ceases to exist. So, the mortgagee can't enforce against the survivor's property because the lien was only on the deceased's share, which is now gone.

So, the court would likely say that the lien is extinguished upon the first cousin's death. Therefore, the mortgagee can't enforce the lien against the sale by the second cousin.

Looking at the options, option D says no because the second cousin became sole owner, so the joint tenancy was intact. That makes sense. So the answer should be D.

Wait, another thought: some jurisdictions might treat the lien as attaching to the property, allowing the mortgagee to enforce against the survivor's interest. But I think the majority rule is that the lien only affects the deceased's interest, which is extinguished. So the mortgagee can't recover from the survivor's ownership.

So, the correct answer is D.

The question revolves around whether a mortgagee can enforce a lien against a property after the death of one joint tenant. In a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship, the surviving tenant automatically becomes the sole owner of the property upon the death of the other tenant. When one joint tenant mortgages their interest, the lien attaches only to that tenant's share, not the entire property. Upon the death of the first cousin, his interest ceases to exist, and the lien on his interest is extinguished. The second cousin, as the sole owner, is not obligated to satisfy the lien from the deceased's share. 

Option D correctly reflects this principle, stating that the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, and the lien was extinguished upon the first cousin's death.

Answer: D
