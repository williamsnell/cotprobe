Okay, so I've got this question about abelian groups and I need to figure out whether the two statements are true or false. Let's take it step by step.

First, let me read the statements again.

Statement 1: There exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank.

Hmm, I remember that a free abelian group is one that has a basis, like a vector space but with integers instead of a field. So the rank is the number of elements in the basis. For any positive integer n, can I find a free abelian group with rank n? I'm pretty sure the answer is yes. For example, for rank 1, it's just the integers Z. For rank 2, it's Z × Z, and so on. So Statement 1 seems true.

Now, Statement 2: A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.

Wait, I need to unpack this. The Betti number is the rank of the group, right? Because the Betti number in the context of finitely generated abelian groups refers to the free rank. So if the group is finitely generated, it can be expressed as a direct sum of cyclic groups. The free part is the part without torsion, so the Betti number is the number of free generators.

So Statement 2 is saying that if the Betti number (which is the rank) equals the size of a generating set, then the group is free abelian. Let me think about that. If the group is finitely generated, then it's isomorphic to Z^r ⊕ (finite cyclic groups). The Betti number is r.

If the Betti number equals the number of generators, then what does that imply? Well, in a finitely generated abelian group, the minimal number of generators is equal to the rank (Betti number) plus the number of torsion generators, because each torsion element can be generated by one element. So, if the Betti number is equal to the number of generators, that would mean that there are no torsion elements because the number of generators is exactly the Betti number. So the group would be free abelian. Because if there were any torsion, you'd need more generators than the Betti number.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose I have a group G = Z^r ⊕ (torsion part). A generating set must include at least r elements for the free part and one for each torsion cyclic factor. So the minimal number of generators is r + k, where k is the number of torsion factors. So if the generating set has exactly r elements, which equals the Betti number, that implies that k must be zero because the minimal number of generators can't be less than r. So the group has no torsion and is free abelian. So Statement 2 is true.

So both statements are true. Looking back at the options, option J says both are true.
</think>

Statement 1: There exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank.  
This is true because for any positive integer \( n \), a free abelian group of rank \( n \) can be constructed, such as \( \mathbb{Z}^n \). The rank corresponds to the number of elements in a basis, and such groups exist for all \( n \geq 1 \).

Statement 2: A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.  
This is also true. The Betti number represents the rank of the free part of the group. If the Betti number equals the size of a generating set, it implies there is no torsion (since torsion would require additional generators). Therefore, the group must be free abelian.

Both statements are true.
