Question:

A wedding planner owned a summer cottage on the lake. In order to facilitate the access to the cottage, which is located on a knoll above the lake, the wedding planner entered into an agreement with a neighbor, an adjoining land owner, whereby the neighbor, in writing, granted the wedding planner a right-of-way over a strip of land 30 feet in width and a quarter of a mile in length along the eastern margin of the neighbor's property. Without notif'ing the neighbor, the wedding planner proceeded with his plan to improve the roadbed by having the road asphalted in order to make it more accessible for motor vehicle traffic. Several years later, the neighbor started a sand business, which required him to do heavy hauling that subsequently destroyed the asphalted surface on the road. Ten years after the neighbor started his sand business, the wedding planner sold his lakefront property to an artist. Shortly after the artist took possession of the cottage and property, the neighbor erected wooden barriers across the roadway, thus obstructing the access to the artist's property. The interest that the wedding planner acquired in the access road may best be described as

Options:

A: an easement by estoppel.
B: an easement of light and air.
C: a prescriptive easement.
D: an express easement.
E: a profit a prendre.
F: an easement by necessity.
G: an easement implied by prior use.
H: a license.
I: an easement of support.
J: an easement in gross.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here about easements. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through carefully.

The scenario is about a wedding planner who owns a summer cottage on a lake. To make access easier, he makes an agreement with a neighbor who owns the adjoining land. The neighbor grants him a right-of-way in writing. The specifics are a strip 30 feet wide and a quarter mile long along the eastern edge of the neighbor's property.

So, the key here is that it's a written agreement granting a right-of-way. That sounds like an easement. But wait, which type? I remember that easements can be express, implied, by necessity, etc.

The wedding planner then improves the road by asphalting it without telling the neighbor. Later, the neighbor starts a sand business that damages the asphalt. Ten years pass, and the wedding planner sells the property to an artist. Then the neighbor blocks the road with barriers.

The question is about the type of interest the wedding planner had in the access road.

I think the main point is how the easement was created. Since it was a written agreement, that points towards an express easement. Express easements are created through a written document, like a deed or contract. So when the neighbor granted the right-of-way in writing, that's an express grant.

Wait, but what about other possibilities? Let's think. Could it be an easement by necessity? That usually arises when a parcel is landlocked and the easement is necessary for access. But here, the wedding planner had a cottage on a lake, so maybe he had some access already, or maybe not. The problem doesn't state that it was landlocked, so probably not an easement by necessity.

Easement by estoppel would be if someone was induced to believe they had an easement and relied on it, but that's more when there's a mistake in a conveyance or something. Doesn't fit here because it's a written agreement.

Prescriptive easement is when someone uses the land without permission for a certain period, but that's not the case here. The neighbor agreed, so it's not adverse use.

Profit a prendre is the right to take something from the land, like minerals or timber. Not applicable here.

Easement in gross would mean it's personal to the holder, not attached to land. But here, the easement benefits the wedding planner's property, so it's appurtenant, not in gross.

So the options are down to express easement. The fact that it's written makes it express. The subsequent actions, like asphalting or the neighbor's business, don't really change the type of easement. Even if the easement was later obstructed, the type remains the same.

So I'm leaning towards D: an express easement.
</think>

The wedding planner acquired an easement through a written agreement with the neighbor, granting a right-of-way over a specific strip of land. This written grant indicates the creation of an express easement. Other types of easements, such as easement by necessity or prescriptive easement, do not apply here because the easement was explicitly created by a written document. The subsequent actions, like improving the road or the neighbor obstructing it, do not alter the nature of the easement. Therefore, the interest acquired by the wedding planner is best described as an express easement.

Answer: D
