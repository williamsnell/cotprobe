Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve about finding the capacitance of a single, isolated conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I remember something from my electrostatics class. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, capacitance. Capacitance of a sphere. I remember that for a conducting sphere, the capacitance is related to its radius. But wait, is it just the radius, or does it involve more factors like the permittivity of free space?

I think the formula is something like C equals 4 pi epsilon zero times the radius. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think maybe it's 4 pi epsilon times a, but I'm not entirely sure. Or was it 4 pi epsilon zero multiplied by something else?

Wait, I remember that the electric field outside a conducting sphere is the same as that of a point charge. So when you have a conducting sphere with charge Q, the electric field at a distance r from the center is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q/r²). But how does that relate to capacitance?

Oh right, capacitance is defined as C equals Q divided by V, the potential. So I need to find the potential V of the sphere when it has charge Q.

The potential of a conducting sphere is the same as the potential at its surface. So the potential at the surface is V = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q/a), since r is equal to a, the radius.

So putting that together, C = Q/V = Q / ( (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q/a) ) )

Wait, let's compute that. Substitute V:

C = Q / [ Q/(4π ε₀ a) ) ] 

The Q's cancel out, so C = 4 π ε₀ a. Oh, wait, but wait a second. I think I might be mixing something up here. Because I've heard that for a single sphere, the capacitance is 4πε₀ times a. But I also remember that sometimes when multiple spheres are involved, like in a spherical capacitor, the formula is a bit different.

Wait, another thought. I think the formula is C = 4πε₀ a. So looking at the options, option I is C =4 π ε₀ a. So that would be the correct answer.

But wait, another angle. I remember something about a sphere in isolation having capacitance C = 4 π ε₀ a. But sometimes in problems involving two spheres or capacitors, other terms come in. But in this case, it's a single sphere, so 4 π ε₀ a should be correct.

Wait, but I'm a little confused because sometimes I've seen the formula written as C = 4 π ε₀ r, where r is the radius. So I think that's the same as option I here.

So yeah, I think the correct answer is option I: C =4 π ε₀ a.
</think>

The capacitance of a single, isolated conducting sphere is determined by its radius and the permittivity of free space. The electric field outside the sphere is equivalent to that of a point charge, and the potential at the surface of the sphere is given by \( V = \frac{Q}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 a} \), where \( Q \) is the charge on the sphere and \( a \) is its radius. Capacitance is defined as \( C = \frac{Q}{V} \), so substituting \( V \) into this equation yields:

\[
C = \frac{Q}{\frac{Q}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 a}} = 4 \pi \varepsilon_0 a.
\]

This matches option I. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I: \( C = 4 \pi \varepsilon_0 a \).
