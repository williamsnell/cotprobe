Okay, so I'm trying to solve this PCM question. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem states that a 4 kHz audio signal is being transmitted using PCM. The system operates just above the threshold, and the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 47 dB. I need to find N, the number of binary digits per sample, which will give me M as 2^N.

Wait, the given formulas are a bit confusing. Let me jot them down:

S_O (output signal power) is given by (I² / T_s²) multiplied by (M² S² / 12). 

N_q (quantization noise power) is (I² / T_s) multiplied by (S² / 12)(2f_m). 

N_th (thermal noise power) is (I² / T_s²) multiplied by (P_e² N S² / 3). 

Oh, and there's this note about the error probability P_e: (2^{2N + 2} P_e) = 0.26(1). I think that's supposed to be 0.26 times (1), but maybe it's an approximation. 

So, the system is operating just above threshold, which probably means that the thermal noise is the dominant noise source, or maybe the total noise is just enough to meet the SNR requirement. 

Wait, the SNR is given as 47 dB. SNR is usually the ratio of signal power to noise power. So, SNR = S_O / (N_q + N_th). But since it's just above threshold, perhaps the thermal noise is the limiting factor, and the quantization noise is negligible compared to thermal noise? Or maybe they're adding up.

Wait, but the problem says the output SNR is 47 dB. So I'll have to calculate total noise as the sum of quantization and thermal noise.

Hmm. Let me think about the steps. 

First, I should probably find P_e from the given equation: (2^{2N + 2})*P_e = 0.26. So P_e = 0.26 / (2^{2N+2}).

But wait, 0.26 is probably a rounded number. Maybe it's an approximation from something else. Anyway, I'll proceed with that.

So, the output SNR is S_O / (N_q + N_th) = 47 dB. Converting that to a ratio, 47 dB is 10^(47/10) ≈ 10^4.7 ≈ 5.01e4.

Wait, 10^(47/10) is 10^4.7. Let me compute that: 10^4 is 10000, 10^0.7 is about 5.01, so 10000 *5.01 is 50100. So the ratio is about 50100:1.

So, S_O / (N_q + N_th) = 50100.

Now, let me write expressions for each term.

S_O = (I² / T_s²) * (M² S² / 12)
N_q = (I² / T_s) * (S² / 12)(2f_m)
N_th = (I² / T_s²) * (P_e² N S² / 3)

Wait, but what is N here in N_th? Oh, the problem statement says M = 2^N, so N is the number of bits. So N is what we're solving for. Got it.

But wait, looking at N_th expression: it's (I² / T_s²) multiplied by (P_e squared * N * S squared) divided by 3. Hmm, but N here is the number of samples? Or is N the number of bits? Wait no, in the question, it's M=2^N, so N is the number of bits. So in N_th, the expression has N, which is the same N as the bits. That's a bit confusing. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the problem statement:

The question says, "N, the number of binary digits needed to assign individual binary code designation to the M quantization levels. i.e., M = 2^N." So yes, N is the number of bits. So in the N_th formula, N is the number of bits, which is also used in calculating the thermal noise. Interesting.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the sampling rate. The note says the signal is sampled at 2f_s, where f_s is the Nyquist rate. So the sampling frequency is f_s = 2*f_m, where f_m is the highest frequency component in the signal. Since the signal is 4kHz, f_m =4kHz, so f_s = 8kHz.

Wait, the sampling rate is twice the Nyquist rate? Hmm, I thought Nyquist rate is twice the maximum frequency. So if the maximum frequency is 4kHz, the Nyquist rate is 8kHz, so the sampling is done at 2*f_s, which would be 16kHz? Wait, no, the note says the signal is sampled at 2f_s where f_s is the Nyquist rate. So f_s is 2*f_m. So if f_m is 4kHz, f_s is 8kHz, so the sampling is at 2*f_s = 16kHz. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me proceed.

I think the key is to find expressions for S_O, N_q, N_th, then set up the SNR equation.

So let me write all the terms:

S_O = (I² / T_s²) * (M² S² / 12)

N_q = (I² / T_s) * (S² / 12) * (2f_m) 

N_th = (I² / T_s²) * (P_e² * N * S² / 3)

Wait, but what are I, T_s, and S here? I think I is the current, T_s is the pulse duration, and S is the slope of the coder characteristic. Hmm, but perhaps I can find a ratio that eliminates some variables.

Wait, if I take the ratio S_O / (N_q + N_th), perhaps some terms will cancel out, especially since I, S, and T_s are common factors.

Let me compute S_O / (N_q + N_th).

Let me write down each term:

S_O = (I² / T_s²) * (M² S² / 12) 

N_q = (I² / T_s) * (S² / 12) * (2f_m) 

N_th = (I² / T_s²) * (P_e² N S² / 3)

So, when I compute S_O / (N_q + N_th), the denominator becomes N_q + N_th.

Let me factor out (I² S²) from all terms:

S_O = (I² S²) * (M²) / (12 T_s²)
N_q = (I² S²) * (2 f_m) / (12 T_s)
N_th = (I² S²) * (P_e² N) / (3 T_s²)

So, S_O = (I² S² M²) / (12 T_s²)
N_q = (I² S² 2 f_m) / (12 T_s)
N_th = (I² S² P_e² N) / (3 T_s²)

So, when I take S_O / (N_q + N_th), the (I² S²) terms will cancel out.

So, S_O / (N_q + N_th) = [ M² / (12 T_s²) ] / [ (2 f_m) / (12 T_s) ) + (P_e² N) / (3 T_s²) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: M² / (12 T_s² )

Denominator: [ (2 f_m) / (12 T_s) ) + (P_e² N) / (3 T_s²) ) ]

Let me factor out 1/(12 T_s^2) from the denominator terms:

Wait, let's see. The first term in the denominator is (2 f_m)/(12 T_s) ) = (f_m)/(6 T_s). The second term is (P_e² N)/(3 T_s²) ) = (P_e² N * 4 )/(12 T_s²) )? Maybe that's not the best approach.

Alternatively, let me write each term with denominator 12 T_s²:

First term: (2 f_m)/(12 T_s) = (2 f_m T_s) / (12 T_s²) ) = (f_m T_s) / (6 T_s²) ) = f_m / (6 T_s )

Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's get a common denominator for the two terms in the denominator.

The denominators are 12 T_s and 3 T_s².

The least common denominator is 12 T_s².

So, first term: (2 f_m)/(12 T_s) ) = (2 f_m T_s) / (12 T_s² )

Second term: (P_e^2 N)/(3 T_s^2) ) = (4 P_e^2 N )/(12 T_s^2 )

So, the denominator becomes [ (2 f_m T_s) + 4 P_e^2 N ) ] / (12 T_s^2 )

So, putting it all together:

S_O / (N_q + N_th) = [ M^2 / (12 T_s^2) ] / [ (2 f_m T_s + 4 P_e^2 N) / (12 T_s^2) ) ]

The denominators 12 T_s^2 cancel out, so we have:

= M^2 / (2 f_m T_s + 4 P_e^2 N )

But wait, what is T_s? T_s is the pulse duration, which is 1 / sampling rate. The sampling rate is 2 f_s, and f_s is the Nyquist rate, which is 2 f_m. So the sampling rate f_samp = 2*(2 f_m) )=4 f_m?

Wait, no. Wait, the note says the system operates at just above threshold, and the signal is sampled at 2 f_s, where f_s is the Nyquist rate.

Wait, Nyquist rate is 2 f_m, right? Because for a signal with bandwidth f_m, the Nyquist rate is 2 f_m.

So, sampling rate here is 2 times the Nyquist rate, so f_samp = 2 * 2 f_m =4 f_m.

Thus, T_s = 1 / f_samp = 1/(4 f_m)

So, T_s = 1/(4 f_m) = 1/(4*4e3 Hz) )? Wait, f_m is 4 kHz, which is 4e3 Hz.

So, T_s = 1/(4 *4e3 ) = 1/(16e3 ) seconds.

Wait, 4*4e3 is 16e3, so 1/(16e3) is about 6.25e-5 seconds.

But perhaps it's better to keep it as 1/(4 f_m) for substitution.

So, T_s = 1/(4 f_m )

So, T_s = 1/(4 *4e3 )= 1/(16e3 )= 6.25e-5 s.

But perhaps I don't need to compute the numerical value yet.

So, substituting T_s =1/(4 f_m) into the expression:

S_O / (N_q + N_th) = M^2 / [ 2 f_m * (1/(4 f_m)) ) + 4 P_e^2 N ]

Simplify the denominator:

2 f_m * (1/(4 f_m)) )= 2/(4 ) = 1/2.

And 4 P_e^2 N remains as is.

So denominator becomes (1/2 + 4 P_e^2 N )

So overall, SNR = M^2 / (1/2 +4 P_e^2 N ) = 47 dB in linear scale ≈5e4.

So,

M^2 / (0.5 + 4 P_e^2 N ) ≈5e4.

But M is 2^N, so M^2 = (2^N)^2 =4^N.

So,

4^N / (0.5 +4 P_e^2 N ) =5e4.

Now, we can substitute P_e from the given equation: (2^{2N +2}) P_e =0.26

So,

P_e = 0.26 / ( 2^{2N +2} ) = 0.26 / (4 *4^N ) )= 0.26/(4^{N+1} )

So,

P_e^2 = (0.26)^2 / (4^{2N +2} )

Now, substitute P_e^2 into the SNR equation:

4^N / [ 0.5 +4 * (0.26^2)/(4^{2N +2}) ) * N ] =5e4

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute the denominator:

Denominator = 0.5 + [4 * (0.26^2) * N ] / (4^{2N +2}) )

Simplify the second term:

4 * 0.26^2 * N /4^{2N +2} = (0.26^2) * N *4 /4^{2N +2}.

Wait, 4 is 4^1, so 4^{1} /4^{2N+2} = 1/4^{2N+1}.

So, the second term becomes 0.26^2 * N / 4^{2N +1}.

So, denominator =0.5 + [ (0.0676) * N ] / (4^{2N +1} )

Hmm, 0.26 squared is 0.0676.

So, substituting back:

4^N / [ 0.5 + (0.0676 N )/(4^{2N +1} ) ] =5e4.

This looks complicated, but perhaps for reasonable N values, the second term in the denominator is negligible compared to 0.5. Let's test that.

Suppose N is 8, which is one of the options (option J).

Compute denominator:

0.5 + (0.0676 *8)/(4^{17} )

4^17 is a huge number, so the second term is negligible. So denominator ≈0.5.

So,

4^8 /0.5 = (65536)/0.5 =131072.

Which is 131072, which is less than 5e4 (which is 50,000). Wait no, 131,072 is larger than 50,000. Wait, 5e4 is 50,000. So 131,072>5e4, so SNR would be larger than required. But our target is 5e4, so perhaps N=8 gives a higher SNR than needed.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 4^8: 4^10 is 1e6, 4^8 is 65536. 65536 /0.5 is 131072, which is 131,072. But our target is 50,100, so that's too high. So perhaps N is smaller than 8.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the second term can't be neglected. Let me try N=7 (option D).

Compute denominator:

0.5 + (0.0676 *7 )/(4^{15} )

4^15 is 1,073,741,824.

(0.0676 *7 )=0.4732

0.4732 / 1.07e9 ≈ 4.416e-10.

So denominator≈0.5 + 4.4e-10 ≈0.5.

So,

4^7 =16384.

16384 /0.5=32768.

Which is 32,768, which is less than 5e4 (50,000). So SNR would be lower than required.

Wait, so N=7 gives SNR of about 32,768, which is less than 50,100. So perhaps N=8 gives 131,072, which is higher. So maybe the correct N is 8.

But wait, the options include 8 as option J. But wait, wait, the initial assumption that the second term is negligible may not hold for lower N. Let's try N=5.

Denominator for N=5:

0.5 + (0.0676 *5 )/(4^{11} )

4^11 is 4,194,304.

0.0676*5=0.338.

0.338 /4.194e6 ≈8.05e-8.

So denominator≈0.5. So 4^5=1024.

1024/0.5=2048, which is much less than 5e4.

So that's too low. So N has to be higher than 7.

Wait, but N=8 gives 131,072, which is way higher than 50,100.

Wait, what if the second term is not negligible? Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, the SNR equation is:

4^N / [0.5 + (0.0676 N)/(4^{2N +1}) ) ] =5e4.

So, let's set up the equation as:

4^N = 5e4 * [0.5 + (0.0676 N)/(4^{2N +1}) ]

But this seems complicated to solve algebraically. Maybe I can try plugging in the options and see which N satisfies this equation.

Let me try N=8:

Left side:4^8=65536.

Right side:5e4 * [0.5 + (0.0676 *8)/(4^{17}) ]

Compute denominator 4^{17}=17179869184.

0.0676 *8=0.5408.

0.5408 /1.717e10≈3.15e-9.

So 0.5 +3.15e-9≈0.50000000315.

So, 5e4 *0.5 =25000, plus 5e4 *3.15e-9≈1.575e-4. So total≈25000.0001575.

So, 65536 ≈5e4 * denominator.

So 65536 ≈25000.0001575. Not equal. So 65536 is much larger than 25000. So this doesn't satisfy the
