Okay, so I have this question here about a calculator's discount, and I need to figure out the percentage. Let me read it again carefully.

The calculator's list price is $10.00, and there's a $4.00 trade discount. The question is asking for the percentage of the discount. The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

Hmm, right. Trade discount usually means the amount subtracted from the list price, right? So the discount here is $4.00 off the original $10.00.

Wait, how do I calculate the percentage? I remember that to find the percentage discount, I can use the formula: (Discount amount / Original price) * 100. That should give me the percentage.

So plugging in the numbers... The discount is $4, and the original price is $10. So it's (4 / 10) * 100. Let me do that math. 4 divided by 10 is 0.4, and multiplying by 100 gives 40%.

Looking at the options, option F is 40%. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait a second. Are there any other ways this could be calculated? Like, sometimes people confuse markup and discounts, but in this case, it's straightforward. The discount is a straightforward subtraction from the list price. So yes, 40% makes sense.

I think that's correct. So the answer is F.

The trade discount is calculated as a percentage of the list price. Using the formula (Discount / Original Price) * 100, we find that ($4 / $10) * 100 equals 40%. Therefore, the correct answer is F.
