The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The owner of a parcel of land received the following letter from a buyer: "I will pay you $2,200 an acre for [theparcel]." The owner's letter of reply stated, "I accept your offer." Unknown to the owner, the buyer had intendedto offer only $2,000 per acre but had mistakenly typed "$2,200." As both parties knew, comparable land in thevicinity had been selling at prices between $2,000 and $2,400 per acre. Which of the following states the probable legal consequences of the correspondence between theparties?

Options:

A: There is a contract formed at a price of $2,400 per acre, as it is the highest price in the vicinity.
B: There is a contract, but the price per acre will be determined by a third-party appraiser.
C: There is no contract, because the parties attached materially different meanings to the price term.
D: There is no enforceable contract, because the buyer is entitled to rescission due to a mutual mistake asto a basic assumption.
E: There is no contract, because the buyer can argue that the price was a typo.
F: There is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, but the buyer can renegotiate the price.
G: There is no contract, because the parties have not met in person to discuss the deal.
H: There is a contract formed at a price of $2,000 per acre, as it is the lowest price in the vicinity.
I: There is a contract formed at a price of $2,000 per acre, as the buyer intended.
J: There is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might need to think through each part carefully.

Alright, the scenario is about a landowner and a buyer. The buyer sends a letter offering to pay $2,200 per acre for the parcel. The owner then writes back accepting the offer. But here's the twist: the buyer actually meant to offer $2,000 but made a typo. Neither the owner nor the buyer knew about this mistake. Also, both are aware that similar land in the area is selling between $2,000 and $2,400 per acre. 

The question is about the legal consequences of this exchange. Do they have a valid contract? And if so, at what price? Or is there no contract at all?

I remember that for a contract to be valid, there must be an offer, acceptance, and mutual consideration. Also, the terms need to be sufficiently definite. So the first thing I should consider is whether there was a valid offer and acceptance, and whether the mistake affects this.

The buyer's offer was $2,200, which the owner accepted. So on the surface, there's an offer and an acceptance. But the buyer made a mistake in the offer. I think this relates to the concept of mistake in contract law.

Mistakes can be unilateral or mutual. A unilateral mistake is when only one party is mistaken, and the other knows or should know about it. A mutual mistake is where both parties are mistaken about the same thing. Here, the buyer made a mistake in the offer, but the owner didn't know about it and presumably thought the offer was genuine. So it's a unilateral mistake.

In contract law, a unilateral mistake doesn't usually invalidate a contract, especially if the non-mistaken party relied on it. But wait, there's an exception. If the mistake relates to a fundamental aspect of the contract and the other party knew or should have known about it, then the contract can be voidable.

In this case, the buyer offered $2,200, and the owner accepted. The owner had no reason to know that the buyer intended $2,000. Since the typo was in the buyer's offer, and the owner just accepted it as is, it seems like the owner didn't know about the mistake.

So would the buyer be bound by the $2,200 offer? Because the owner accepted in good faith, and without knowledge of the mistake, the buyer might be stuck with the higher price.

Another angle is the concept of "meeting of the minds," which requires that both parties agree on the material terms. Here, the buyer intended $2,000, but the offer was $2,200. The owner accepted $2,200. So their minds didn't meet on the price. But wait, the owner's acceptance was based on the written offer, which was clear. So from the owner's perspective, the price was $2,200, and they accepted that. The buyer's intention was different, but the written offer was $2,200.

In such cases, the courts generally look at the objective manifestation of intent, not the subjective intent. So even if the buyer intended $2,000, the offer was $2,200, and the owner accepted that. Therefore, there's a contract at $2,200, unless the mistake was so obvious that the owner should have known.

But in this scenario, the comparable sales are between $2,000 and $2,400. So $2,200 is within that range. The owner wouldn't have any reason to suspect that the buyer made a typo because $2,200 is a reasonable price in the market. So the owner's acceptance was in good faith.

Therefore, the contract would be enforceable at $2,200 per acre. The buyer can't claim a mistake because the owner didn't know about it, and it's not so obvious that it's a typo given the market prices.

Looking at the options:

A: Contract at $2,400. No, that's higher than the offer.

B: Price determined by appraiser. I don't see any indication that they agreed to that.

C: No contract because different meanings. But the owner accepted the written offer, which was clear. So there is a contract.

D: No contract due to mutual mistake. No, it's a unilateral mistake.

E: No contract because typo. No, because typo was unilateral, and owner didn't know.

F: Contract at $2,200, but buyer can renegotiate. I don't think so; once accepted, the contract is formed.

G: No contract because no in-person meeting. That's not a requirement for a contract. Letters are fine.

H: Contract at $2,000. No, because the offer was $2,200.

I: Contract at $2,000 based on buyer's intent. No, because the written offer was $2,200.

J: Contract at $2,200 regardless of buyer's intent. Yes, that's what I was thinking.

The scenario involves a landowner and a buyer where the buyer sent an offer of $2,200 per acre due to a typo, intending to offer $2,000. The landowner accepted the offer without knowing about the mistake. The key issue is whether a valid contract was formed and at what price.

For a contract to be valid, there must be an offer, acceptance, and mutual understanding of the terms. The buyer's mistake was unilateral, as only the buyer was aware of the error, and the landowner had no reason to suspect it. Courts generally enforce contracts based on the objective terms of the offer and acceptance, not the subjective intentions of the parties. Since the offer was clearly stated at $2,200 and the landowner accepted it in good faith, the contract is enforceable at that price.

The comparable land prices in the vicinity ($2,000 to $2,400 per acre) further support that $2,200 is a reasonable price, and the landowner had no reason to doubt the offer. Therefore, the buyer is bound by the terms of the offer as written, and there is no basis for the buyer to rescind or renegotiate the contract.

**Analysis of the options:**

- **A, H, I, J:** These options focus on the price, but only J correctly identifies that the contract is enforceable at $2,200, consistent with the objective terms of the offer and acceptance.
- **B:** There is no indication that the parties agreed to involve a third-party appraiser.
- **C, E:** While there was a mistake, it was unilateral, and the landowner had no knowledge of it, so the contract remains valid.
- **D:** A mutual mistake would invalidate the contract, but this was a unilateral mistake.
- **F:** The buyer cannot renegotiate the price after the landowner accepted the offer.
- **G:** Contracts can be formed through letters without an in-person meeting.

The correct answer is **J: There is a contract formed at a price of $2,200 per acre, regardless of the buyer's true intention.**
