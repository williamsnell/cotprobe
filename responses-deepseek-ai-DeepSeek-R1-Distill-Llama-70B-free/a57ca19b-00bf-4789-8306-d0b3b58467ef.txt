Okay, so I've got this psychology question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a man who witnessed a horrific event—his wife and children were killed by a speeding truck as they crossed the street. But here's the thing: he has no memory of the event, and when people tell him he must remember, he gets upset. The question is asking what disorder he's most likely suffering from, with the options being A through J.

Hmm, I remember that there are several disorders related to memory and trauma. Let me think about each option.

Option A is major depressive disorder. Well, depression involves persistent sadness, loss of interest, and other symptoms, but the key here is the memory loss. While trauma can lead to depression, the main symptom described is the lack of memory, so maybe not A.

Option B is antisocial personality disorder. That's more about disregard for others' rights, lack of empathy, etc. Doesn't seem to fit here.

Option C is bipolar disorder. That's about mood swings—manic and depressive episodes. Not directly related to memory loss after trauma.

Option D is dissociative amnesia. Oh, right, dissociative disorders involve a disconnection from thoughts, feelings, or experiences. Dissociative amnesia specifically is when someone can't recall important information about themselves or events, especially traumatic ones. This sounds like it fits because the man can't remember the traumatic event.

Option E is conversion disorder, now known as functional neurological symptom disorder. It involves neurological symptoms like paralysis or seizures without a medical cause, often linked to psychological stress. Not about memory loss, so probably not E.

Option F is obsessive-compulsive disorder. That's characterized by obsessions and compulsions. Doesn't match the scenario here.

Option G is schizophrenia. This is a more severe mental disorder with symptoms like delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking. The man's issue is trauma and memory loss, so not G.

Option H is generalized anxiety disorder. That's excessive anxiety and worry about various things. Not the main issue here.

Option I is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD can involve memory of the event, avoiding triggers, nightmares, etc. But in this case, the man has no memory of the event. Wait, but in PTSD, sometimes people have flashbacks, not amnesia. There's a specifier called dissociative symptoms where people might have memory issues, but the primary symptom here is the inability to recall, which points more to dissociative amnesia.

Option J is panic disorder. That's about panic attacks and fear of having more. Not relevant here.

So putting it all together, the key symptom is the inability to remember a traumatic event, which is characteristic of dissociative amnesia. So the answer should be D.

The man in the scenario is unable to remember a traumatic event and becomes upset when reminded of it. This is most consistent with dissociative amnesia, a disorder where individuals forget important aspects of their lives, especially traumatic events, as a way to cope with the stress. Other options like PTSD involve memory of the trauma, not amnesia, and other disorders like depression or anxiety do not specifically address the memory loss described.

Answer: D
