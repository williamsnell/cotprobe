Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the mean free path for oxygen at 25°C under two different pressures: 1 atm and 10^-3 torr. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the mean free path (λ) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The formula for it is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the gas molecules, and P is the pressure. Or wait, maybe I should double-check that formula. Oh right, another version is λ = (1)/(sqrt(2) * π * n * d²), where n is the number density. Oh yeah, and n can be found from the ideal gas law, PV = NkT, so n = P/(kT).

Wait, so combining these, the formula becomes λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d² * P). That makes sense because higher pressure would decrease λ since the molecules are closer together.

So I need the values for each part. Let me jot them down.

Temperature is 25°C, which is 298 K. Oxygen gas, so what's the diameter of an oxygen molecule? I think it's around 3.64 x 10^-10 meters? Or maybe I should confirm. Alternatively, sometimes the collision diameter for O2 is taken as about 0.361 nm, which is 3.61e-10 m. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, I think I might have mixed up some numbers. Let me think. Another source I remember said the diameter of O2 is approximately 3.64 angstroms, which is 3.64e-10 m. So I'll go with that.

Boltzmann's constant k is 1.380649e-23 J/K. Pi is approximately 3.1416, and sqrt(2) is about 1.4142.

Now for part (a), pressure is 1 atm. I need to convert that into Pascals because standard SI units are needed. 1 atm is 101325 Pascals.

Let me plug the numbers in for part (a):

λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d² * P)

So substituting:

k=1.38e-23, T=298, d=3.64e-10 m, P=101325.

Calculating numerator: 1.38e-23 * 298 ≈ 4.1124e-21 J·m.

Denominator: sqrt(2) * π * (3.64e-10)^2 * 101325.

First compute (3.64e-10)^2: (3.64)^2 is about 13.25, so 13.25e-20 m².

Multiply by sqrt(2)*pi: 1.4142 * 3.1416 ≈ 4.4429.

So denominator becomes 4.4429 * 13.25e-20 * 101325.

Let me compute 4.4429 * 13.25e-20 first: 4.4429 *13.25 is about 58.8, so 58.8e-20. Then multiply by 101325:

58.8e-20 * 1e5 (approx, since 1e5 is 10^5, 101325 is about 1.01325e5) → 58.8e-20 * 1.01325e5 ≈ 58.8 * 1.01325e-15.

Wait, 58.8 * 1.01325 is approx 59.6. So denominator is approx 59.6e-15 J·m^-1 (since P is in Pa = N/m² = kg/(m·s²), and other units — but perhaps the units will work out in the end).

Wait, maybe I should compute each step more accurately.

Wait, let me compute the denominator step by step.

Compute d squared: (3.64e-10)^2 = (3.64)^2 * (1e-10)^2 = 13.2496 * 1e-20 = 1.32496e-19 m².

Then multiply by sqrt(2)*pi: 1.4142 * 3.1416 ≈ 4.44288. So 4.44288 * 1.32496e-19 = let's calculate that.

4.44288 * 1.32496 ≈ let's approximate. 4 * 1.325 is 5.3, 0.44288 * 1.325≈0.586. So total approximately 5.886. So 5.886e-19 m².

Wait, no, wait: 4.44288 * 1.32496e-19 = (4.44288 * 1.32496) * 1e-19.

Calculating 4.44288 * 1.32496:

4 * 1.32496 = 5.29984

0.44288 * 1.32496 ≈ 0.44288 * 1.325 ≈ 0.586.

So total ≈5.29984 +0.586=5.88584.

So that's 5.88584e-19 m².

Now multiply by pressure P: 101325 Pa.

So denominator is 5.88584e-19 m² * 101325 Pa.

101325 is ~1.01325e5.

Multiply 5.88584e-19 * 1.01325e5 = 5.88584 *1.01325e-14.

5.88584 *1.01325 ≈ approx 5.96.

So denominator is ~5.96e-14 (since 1e-19 * 1e5 = 1e-14).

Wait, no: 5.88584e-19 * 1.01325e5 = (5.88584 *1.01325) * (1e-19 *1e5) )= (5.96) * 1e-14 = 5.96e-14.

So denominator is 5.96e-14 m²·Pa.

Now numerator is 4.1124e-21 J·m (since k*T is in J, and then multiplied by m? Wait, no. Wait, the numerator is (k*T), which is in J, because k is J/K, T is K: so k*T = J. Then, when you divide by (denominator in Pa, which is kg/(m·s²)), let me think about the units.

Wait, perhaps it's better to just proceed with the calculation.

So λ = numerator / denominator = (4.1124e-21) / (5.96e-14) m.

Wait, because numerator is in J (kg·m²/s²), denominator is in Pa·m² (since d² is m², and P is Pa which is kg/(m·s²)).

Wait, in the denominator, we have sqrt(2)*pi*d²*P. So the unit is (m²) * (kg/(m·s²)) )= kg/(s²·m). Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should just calculate the value.

So 4.1124e-21 / 5.96e-14 = (4.1124 /5.96) * 1e-7.

4.1124 /5.96 ≈ 0.6898.

So 0.6898e-7 m = 6.898e-8 m, which is approximately 6.90e-8 meters, or about 6.9e-8 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see options with 7.02e-8 and 6.02e-8. Hmm, maybe my approximations are off. Let me re-calculate more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I was a bit too approximate with the numbers. Let me try a more precise calculation.

Compute numerator: k*T = 1.380649e-23 J/K * 298 K = approx 4.1145e-21 J.

Denominator:

sqrt(2) = 1.41421356

pi = 3.14159265

d = 3.64e-10 m → d²= (3.64e-10)^2 = 13.2496e-20 m² = 1.32496e-19 m².

So denominator part1: sqrt(2)*pi = 1.41421356 *3.14159265 ≈ 4.442882908.

Multiply by d²: 4.442882908 *1.32496e-19 = let's compute 4.442882908 *1.32496.

4 *1.32496 =5.29984

0.442882908 *1.32496 → let's compute 0.4 *1.32496=0.529984; 0.042882908 *1.32496≈0.05686.

So total is 0.529984 +0.05686≈0.58684.

So 4.44288 *1.32496≈5.29984 +0.58684=5.88668.

So denominator part1:5.88668e-19 m².

Now multiply by pressure P=101325 Pa:

5.88668e-19 m² *101325 Pa = ?

101325 = 1.01325e5.

So 5.88668e-19 *1.01325e5 = (5.88668 *1.01325) * 1e-14.

Compute 5.88668 *1.01325.

Let me compute that:

5 *1.01325=5.06625

0.88668 *1.01325= approx 0.88668*1=0.88668; 0.88668*0.01325≈0.01174 → total 0.88668+0.01174≈0.89842.

So total 5.06625 +0.89842=5.96467.

So denominator is 5.96467e-14.

Now λ = numerator / denominator =4.1145e-21 /5.96467e-14.

Divide 4.1145e-21 by 5.96467e-14:

4.1145 /5.96467 ≈0.6895.

And 1e-21 /1e-14 =1e-7.

So λ≈0.6895e-7 m →6.895e-8 m, which is approximately 6.90e-8 meters, which is 6.9e-8 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 6.02e-8 m for part (a). Option H is 7.02e-8, option A is 7.02e-8. Hmm, but my calculation is about 6.9e-8, which is close to 7e-8. Maybe I made a mistake in the molecule diameter. Oh wait, perhaps I used the wrong diameter for O2.

Let me double-check the collision diameter for O2. Another source says that the collision diameter for O2 is about 0.361 nm, which is 3.61e-10 m. I used 3.64e-10 earlier. Let me try with 3.61e-10.

So d=3.61e-10 m.

d squared is (3.61e-10)^2 = (3.61)^2=13.0321 → 13.0321e-20 =1.30321e-19 m².

Denominator part1: sqrt(2)*pi =4.44288.

Multiply by d squared:4.44288 *1.30321e-19 = 4.44288 *1.30321e-19.

Compute 4 *1.30321 =5.21284.

0.44288 *1.30321≈approx 0.44288*1.3=0.5757; 0.44288*0.00321≈0.001423 → total≈0.5771.

Total:5.21284 +0.5771=5.78994e-19.

Multiply by P=101325:

5.78994e-19 *1.01325e5=5.78994 *1.01325e-14.

5.78994 *1.01325 ≈5.86 (exact value needed).

5 *1.01325=5.06625

0.78994 *1.01325 → approx 0.78994*1=0.78994; 0.78994 *0.01325≈0.01047 → total 0.80041.

Total 5.06625 +0.80041=5.86666.

So denominator is 5.86666e-14.

Numerator is same, 4.1145e-21.

So λ=4.1145e-21 /5.86666e-14= (4.1145/5.86666)e-7.

4.1145 /5.86666≈0.7013.

So 0.7013e-7 m =7.013e-8 m, which is 7.013e-8 m.

Ah, okay, that's about 7.02e-8 m, which matches some of the options. So for part (a), the mean free path is approximately 7.02e-8 meters.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have messed up in the calculation where I switched the diameter. So in my first calculation with d=3.64e-10 m, I got around 6.9e-8 m, but with d=3.61e-10 m, I get 7.02e-8 m. So which is correct? I need to know the exact diameter used in the problem. But since in the options, 7.02e-8 is present, perhaps that's the correct value for part (a).

So part (a) is 7.02e-8 m.

Now part (b) is at 10^-3 torr. I need to convert that pressure into Pascals.

First, 1 torr is 133.322 Pascals. So 10^-3 torr is 0.133322 Pa.

So P=0.133322 Pa.

Let me compute lambda again with this pressure.

Lambda = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * pi * d^2 * P).

Wait, but since all other variables (k, T, d) are same, except P, which is lower by a factor of (101325 Pa)/(0.133322 Pa) = approx 760. Because 1 atm is about 760 mmHg, and 1 mmHg is 1 torr. So 1 torr is 1 mmHg, and 1 atm is 760 torr. So 10^-3 torr is 1e-3 /760 atm. Wait, no. Wait, 1 atm =760 torr. So 1 torr =1/760 atm. So 10^-3 torr = (10^-3)/760 atm = 1.31579e-6 atm.

Alternatively, in Pascals: 1e-3 torr =1e-3 *133.322 Pa=0.133322 Pa.

So using the same formula:

lambda = (1.38e-23 *298) / (sqrt(2)*pi*(3.61e-10)^2 *0.133322 )

Compute numerator same as before:1.38e-23*298=4.1124e-21.

Denominator: same as before, sqrt(2)*pi*d² is 5.88668e-19 m² (from part a when d=3.61e-10 m).

Wait, no, wait, in part (a), denominator was 5.88668e-19 m² when P is 1 atm. So for part (b), P is 0.133322 Pa, so denominator is 5.88668e-19 * 0.133322.

Wait, no, the denominator in the formula is sqrt(2)*pi*d² * P. So in part (a), denominator in the formula was 5.88668e-19 *101325. For part (b), it's 5.88668e-19 *0.133322.

So denominator for part (b) is 5.88668e-19 *0.133322 = let's compute that.

Approximately 5.88668e-19 *0.133322 ≈ (5.88668 *0.133322) *1e-19.

5 *0.133322=0.66661.

0.88668 *0.133322≈approx 0.1183.

So total ≈0.66661 +0.1183=0.78491.

So denominator is 0.78491e-19 =7.8491e-20.

Wait, wait, no: 5.88668e-19 *0.133322 = (5.88668 *0.133322) *1e-19.

5.88668 *0.133322 → let me compute this accurately.

5 *0.133322=0.66661.

0.88668 *0.133322 → 0.8 *0.133322=0.1066576; 0.08*0.133322=0.0106658; 0.00668*0.133322≈0.00089. So total≈0.1066576 +0.0106658=0.1173234 +0.00089=0.1182134.

So 0.66661 +0.1182134=0.7848234.

So denominator is 0.7848234e-19.

Wait, no, wait: 5.88668e-19 *0.133322 Pa → 5.88668 *0.133322 =0.7848234, so 0.7848234e-19 =7.848234e-20.

So denominator is 7.848234e-20 m²·Pa.

Wait, no, wait, the denominator is (sqrt(2)*pi*d²) * P, which in part (b) is (5.88668e-19 m²) * 0.133322 Pa.

So 5.88668e-19 *0.133322 = (5.88668 *0.133322) e-19 = 0.
