Okay, so I need to figure out the Yiddish word for "covenant." Hmm, I remember that Yiddish has a lot of words borrowed from Hebrew, especially for religious terms. Let me think about each option.

Option A is Haggadah. I think that's the text read during Passover Seder. So that's probably not it.

Option B is Halakhah. That sounds familiar too. I believe Halakhah refers to Jewish law, like the collective body of religious laws. So not a covenant.

Option C is Brit. Wait, I've heard that before. In Hebrew, "brit" means covenant. Like when we talk about the covenant of circumcision, it's called Brit Milah. But is that also the Yiddish term? I'm pretty sure it is because Yiddish uses a lot of Hebrew words for such concepts.

Option D is Bris. Bris sounds similar to Brit. I think Bris is actually the Yiddish pronunciation of Brit. Because in Yiddish, some Hebrew words are pronounced differently. For example, in Hebrew, it's "brit," but in Yiddish, it might be "bris." So Bris is the Yiddish term for covenant.

Wait, so the question is asking specifically for Yiddish. So if Brit is Hebrew and Bris is Yiddish, then the answer would be D: Bris.

Let me double-check. Brit Milah is the circumcision covenant, and in Yiddish, it's often called a bris. So yes, Bris is the Yiddish word for covenant.

The Yiddish word for "covenant" is "Bris," which is the Yiddish pronunciation of the Hebrew word "Brit."
