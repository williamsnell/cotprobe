Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about market research methods. Let's see what it's asking. The question is about a company selling a product at two different prices in two different locations. They want to know which type of research will best identify the optimal price, assuming all other marketing factors are constant.

Hmm, I remember that different research methods are used for different purposes. Let me think about each option.

Option A is Experimental. Experimental research involves manipulating variables to see the effect. Since the company is already selling at two different prices, maybe they're conducting an experiment by changing the price and observing the outcome. This could help determine causality between price and sales.

Option B is Predictive. Predictive research is about forecasting future trends. Not sure if that's what's needed here because they're looking for the optimal price now, not predicting future sales.

Option C is Causal. Causal research aims to establish cause and effect. This sounds similar to experimental because experiments are often used to determine causality. So maybe C is a contender, but I think experimental is more specific here.

Option D is Observational. Observational research is where you observe without interfering. But in this case, the company is already changing prices, so it's more active than passive observation.

Option E is Longitudinal. That's a long-term study over time. The question doesn't mention time, so maybe not relevant here.

Option F is Correlational. This looks for relationships but doesn't establish causation. So it might show a correlation between price and sales, but not necessarily the best price point.

Option G is Ethnographic. That's more about understanding culture and behavior through detailed observation, probably not relevant to pricing.

Option H is Descriptive. Descriptive research describes characteristics, like market size. It doesn't necessarily test variables to find the best price.

Option I is Cross-sectional. This involves looking at data from different groups at a single point in time. Could be useful, but if they're testing two prices in two locations, that's cross-sectional, but the key is whether it's experimental.

Option J is Exploratory. This is for initial investigations to understand a problem. They're past that stage since they're testing prices.

Wait, so the company is already varying the price (independent variable) and measuring the effect (dependent variable, like sales). That's setting up an experiment. So the best method here is experimental research because it allows them to control variables and see the effect of price changes.

So the correct answer should be A: Experimental.

To determine the optimal price for a product when all other marketing factors are held constant, the most effective research method would involve actively manipulating the price (the independent variable) and observing the effect on sales or consumer behavior (the dependent variable). This scenario aligns with experimental research, which is designed to establish cause-and-effect relationships by controlling variables and testing their impact.

Other options like observational, correlational, or cross-sectional research do not involve active manipulation of variables, making them less suitable for identifying the optimal price. Predictive, longitudinal, and ethnographic research focus on forecasting, long-term trends, or cultural behaviors, respectively, which are not the primary goals here. Descriptive and exploratory research are more about understanding characteristics or initial investigations, which are not as precise for this purpose.

Thus, experimental research is the most appropriate choice as it allows the company to directly test the impact of different prices and identify the optimal one.
