Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about ethical responsibilities of a psychologist working with a child in a school setting. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think through it carefully.

The question is asking what the psychologist should do to meet their ethical responsibilities when counseling a 10-year-old. The options are A through J, each describing different consent and assent scenarios.

I remember that when dealing with minors, there are specific rules about consent and assent. Let me try to recall. Informed consent usually requires that a parent or legal guardian gives permission for a minor to receive psychological services. But the child's assent is also important. Assent means the child agrees to participate, but it's not as formal as consent.

Wait, so for someone under 18, the parent gives consent, and the child gives assent. The assent can be verbal because the child might not be able to sign a written form. But the parent's part is typically written consent.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through each:

Option A: Parents provide written consent, child's assent is non-verbal. I think non-verbal might be okay, but I'm not sure if it's the best. Maybe verbal is preferred because it's more clear.

Option B: Both parents and child provide written consent. But the child is 10, maybe can't sign, so this might not be necessary. Also, the child's part is assent, not consent.

Option C: Child provides written and verbal consent. No, because the child can't legally consent; it's the parents who consent.

Option D: Parents give written consent, child assents verbally. That sounds right because the parent's part is written, and the child's is verbal assent.

Option E: Psychologist gets written consent from school and parents. Wait, does the school need to give consent? I thought it's the parents, but maybe the school has some role in referral. But the question is about the psychologist's ethical responsibility, which primarily involves the parent and child.

Option F: School provides written consent, child assents. No, because the school isn't the legal guardian. Unless the school has some authority, which I don't think so in this context.

Option G: Parents give both written and verbal consent. That's more than necessary. Written is sufficient for consent, verbal might not add much here. But the main point is the child's assent.

Option H: Parents verbal, child written. No, because the parent's consent should be written, and child's assent is usually verbal.

Option I: Child gives verbal assent. But where's the parent's consent? This can't be right because the parent's consent is needed.

Option J: Psychologist gets verbal consent from school. No, the school isn't the legal guardian, so their consent isn't what's needed here.

So the correct approach is that the parents provide written consent, and the child gives verbal assent. Looking back, that's option D. So the best answer is D.

The best way for the psychologist to meet their ethical responsibility is to obtain written consent from the parent(s) and verbal assent from the child. This ensures compliance with legal and ethical standards, where minors require parental consent and are encouraged to provide their assent.

Answer: D
