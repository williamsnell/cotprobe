Okay, so I have this problem about saturated steam condensing on a vertical pipe. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem states that saturated steam at 100°F is condensing on the outer surface of a vertical pipe. The pipe is 1 foot long and has an outer diameter of 6 inches. The pipe is maintained at 80°F. I need to find the average coefficient of heat transfer, the rate of heat transfer, and the mass flow rate of the condensate, assuming laminar flow.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I remember that when a vapor condenses on a surface, it's a process of film condensation. The heat transfer coefficient for this can be calculated using certain correlations.

I think the formula for the average heat transfer coefficient (h) for film condensation on a vertical surface is given by the Nusselt theory. The Nusselt equation for vertical surfaces is h = (4 * k^3 * ρ * g * (T_sat - T_surface)) / (μ * D * (Ja)) )^(1/4), wait no, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Alternatively, I've heard of the correlation involving the Reynolds number.

Wait, another approach: For laminar film condensation on a vertical plate, the average Nusselt number is Nu = (4 * Ja) / (1 - (η_liquid/η_vapor)) ), but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is Nu = ( ( ( (4 * Pr * Re) ) / ( (1 - ρ_vapor/ρ_liquid) ) ) )^(1/2) ), but I might be getting that wrong. Maybe I should look for the specific formula for vertical surfaces.

Wait, wait. I remember that for film condensation on a vertical surface, the average heat transfer coefficient can be found using the correlation:

h = ( (k^3 * g * ρ (ρ - ρ_v) (T_sat - T_w)) ) / (μ D (Ja)) )^(1/4)

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is h = ( (k³ * g * ρ * (ρ - ρ_vapor) * (T_sat - T_surface)) ) / (μ * D * (Ja)) ))^(1/4) )

Wait, perhaps another approach: the Nusselt number for vertical surfaces is Nu = (h L k) )^(-1), no. Wait, the Nusselt number is h L / k, where L is the characteristic length. So for vertical surfaces, the characteristic length is the height of the surface, which in this case is 1 ft.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. For film condensation on a vertical plate, the average Nusselt number is given by:

Nu = ( (4 * Pr * Re) ) / (1 + 3.022 Pr^{0.5}) ) )^{1/2}

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is:

h = ( (k³ g ρ (ρ - ρ_v) (T_sat - T_w)) ) / (μ D Ja) )^(1/4)

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, I remember that the heat transfer coefficient for laminar film condensation on a vertical surface can be calculated using:

h = 0.943 * ( (k³ g ρ (ρ - ρ_v) (T_sat - T_w)) ) / (μ D Ja) )^(1/4)

No, wait, perhaps that's the formula for a vertical plate. Since the problem is about a vertical pipe, which is a cylinder, maybe the formula is a bit different. I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I think the formula for vertical cylinders (like a pipe) is similar to that for vertical plates, with the characteristic length being the diameter. Or maybe the formula adjusts the length in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is the same as for a vertical plate because the curvature doesn't matter much for a thin film.

Hmm. Let's think about the properties first. Saturated steam at 100°F. So the saturation temperature T_sat is 100°F. The surface temperature T_w is 80°F. The temperature difference is 20°F. But I think I need to convert these temperatures to absolute temperatures for the properties, or maybe use them as is because the formulas might account for that.

Wait, properties for steam at 100°F. I need to find the properties of the saturated vapor and the saturated liquid at 100°F. Let me recall the properties:

At 100°F, the saturation pressure is about 1 atm (14.7 psia is at 100°F? Wait, no, wait, 100°C is 1 atm, but 100°F is about 38°C, so the pressure is higher than atmospheric. Wait, no, 100°F is 37.8°C, which is lower than 100°C, so the saturation pressure is lower than atmospheric. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Wait, 100°F is about 37.8°C, and at that temperature, the saturation pressure is about 1.0 atm? No, wait, actually, at 100°F (37.8°C), the saturation pressure is about 1.0 atm. Hmm, wait, let me confirm: at 100°F, the vapor pressure of water is about 1 atm. So yes, that's correct.

So for saturated steam at 100°F (T_sat = 100°F), the properties would be:

- Vapor density (ρ_v) is about 0.0597 lbm/ft³.
- Liquid density (ρ_l) is about 62.4 lbm/ft³.
- Liquid viscosity (μ_l) is about 0.00031 lbm/ft·hr.
- Thermal conductivity of liquid (k_l) is about 0.364 Btu/hr·ft·°F.
- Specific heat capacity of liquid (c_p) is about 1.0 Btu/lbm·°F.
- latent heat (h_fg) is about 1038.3 Btu/lbm.

Wait, I'm not 100% certain about these values, but I think they're in the right ballpark. Let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values, but since this is a problem-solving scenario, I'll proceed with these.

So, the temperature difference is T_sat - T_w = 20°F. Since the problem gives all temperatures in °F, I think the formulas can handle that as long as the properties are in consistent units.

Now, the pipe is vertical, so I think the correct formula for the average heat transfer coefficient is:

h = ( (k^3 g ρ (ρ - ρ_v) (T_sat - T_w)) ) / (μ * D * Ja) )^(1/4)

Wait, but I'm not confident about the formula. Another approach: the Nusselt number for vertical surfaces is given by:

Nu = 0.943 [ (Pr g (T_sat - T_w) / ν^2 ) ( (ρ (ρ - ρ_v) ) / μ ) ) ]^(1/4)

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, I've read that the average Nusselt number for a vertical plate can be calculated by:

Nu = (4 Pr Re )^(1/2) / (1 + 3.022 Pr^{0.5} )

But I'm not sure about the Reynolds number in this context. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

h = (k^3 * g * ρ * (ρ - ρ_v) * (T_sat - T_w)) / (μ D Ja) )^(1/4)

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct formula for film condensation on a vertical surface. Oh wait, I can't look it up, so I have to rely on memory.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

h = 0.943 * [ (k^3 * g * ρ * (ρ - ρ_v) * (T_sat - T_w)) / (μ D * Ja) ) ]^(1/4)

Where:

- k is thermal conductivity of liquid
- μ is dynamic viscosity of liquid
- ρ is density of liquid
- ρ_v is density of vapor
- D is the diameter of the pipe
- Ja is the Jakob number, which is (c_p (T_sat - T_w)) / h_fg
- g is acceleration due to gravity, 32.2 ft/s²

Wait, but in the formula, is D the diameter or the length? Since the pipe is vertical and the length is 1 ft, but in the formula, I think D is the diameter because it's a vertical plate or cylinder. Alternatively, perhaps for a vertical cylinder, the formula uses the diameter as the characteristic length.

So let me proceed with that formula.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, let's compute the Jakob number, Ja.

Ja = (c_p (T_sat - T_w)) / h_fg

Plugging in the numbers:

c_p = 1.0 Btu/lbm·°F

T_sat - T_w = 100°F - 80°F = 20°F

h_fg = 1038.3 Btu/lbm

So Ja = (1.0 * 20) / 1038.3 ≈ 0.01925

Next, compute the numerator inside the big brackets:

k^3 * g * ρ * (ρ - ρ_v) * (T_sat - T_w)

k is 0.364 Btu/hr·ft·°F, so k^3 is (0.364)^3 ≈ 0.0483 (Btu³/(hr³·ft³·°F³))

g is 32.2 ft/s²

ρ is 62.4 lbm/ft³

ρ - ρ_v = 62.4 - 0.0597 ≈ 62.3403 lbm/ft³

T_sat - T_w is 20°F

Multiply all these together:

0.0483 * 32.2 * 62.4 * 62.3403 * 20

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

0.0483 * 32.2 = approx 1.55466

1.55466 * 62.4 ≈ 96.942 (since 62.4 * 1.5 is 93.6, plus 0.05466*62.4≈3.41, so total ≈97.02)

97.02 * 62.3403 ≈ 6054.7

6054.7 * 20 = 121,094

So numerator is approximately 121,094.

Denominator is μ * D * Ja

μ is 0.00031 lbm/ft·hr

D is 6 inches, which is 0.5 ft

Ja is 0.01925

So denominator = 0.00031 * 0.5 * 0.01925

Let me compute that:

0.00031 * 0.5 = 0.000155

0.000155 * 0.01925 ≈ 0.000002982

So denominator is approx 2.982e-6

So the term inside the brackets is numerator / denominator = 121,094 / 0.000002982 ≈ 40,625,000

Wait, 121,094 divided by approximately 0.000003 is about 40,364,666,667. That seems extremely high. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, k is 0.364, so k^3 is 0.364^3 = 0.0483 (correct).

g is 32.2 ft/s² (correct).

ρ is 62.4 lbm/ft³ (correct).

ρ - ρ_v is 62.4 - 0.0597 ≈ 62.3403 lbm/ft³.

(T_sat - T_w) is 20°F (correct).

So 0.0483 * 32.2 = let's compute accurately: 0.0483 * 32.2.

0.0483 * 30 = 1.449

0.0483 * 2.2 ≈ 0.10626

Total ≈ 1.449 + 0.10626 ≈ 1.55526

Then multiply by 62.4: 1.55526 * 62.4

Let me compute 1.5 * 62.4 = 93.6

0.05526 * 62.4 ≈ 3.447

So total ≈ 93.6 + 3.447 = 97.047

Then multiply by 62.3403: 97.047 * 62.3403 ≈ let's approximate. 97 * 60 = 5820, 97 * 2.3403 ≈ 227. So total approx 6047.

Then multiply by 20: 6047 * 20 = 120,940.

So numerator is 120,940.

Denominator: μ is 0.00031 lbm/ft·hr.

D is 0.5 ft.

Ja is 0.01925.

So denominator = 0.00031 * 0.5 = 0.000155.

0.000155 * 0.01925 = let's compute 0.000155 * 0.02 = 0.0000031, but since it's 0.01925, it's 0.000155 * 0.01925 = 0.000002982 approximately.

So denominator is 0.000002982.

So the term inside the brackets is 120940 / 0.000002982 ≈ Let's compute 120940 / 0.000003 = 40,313,333,333. Hmm, that's a huge number.

Wait, but then we take the 1/4 power of this. So h would be 0.943 * (40,313,333,333 )^(1/4)

Wait, let's compute 40,313,333,333^(1/4). Let's see: 1e12^(1/4) is 1e3, since (1e3)^4 = 1e12. So 4e13^(1/4) is around 4.64e3. Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 40,313,333,333 is approximately 4.0313333333e10.

Wait, 4e10^(1/4) is (4)^(1/4) * (1e10)^(1/4) = sqrt(2) * (1e2.5) = 1.4142 * 316.227766 ≈ 447. So 4e10^(1/4) is approximately 447.

But wait, 447^4 is (447^2)^2 = (199,809)^2 ≈ 3.986e10, which is about 4e10. So yes, 447^4 ≈ 4e10.

So 4.031e10^(1/4) ≈ 447. So the term inside becomes 447.

Multiply by 0.943: 0.943 * 447 ≈ 421. So h ≈ 421 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 1250, B:1500, C:1357, D:1200. None are near 421. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe I should have used the correlation for a vertical plate, which is h = (k^3 g ρ (ρ - ρ_v) (T_sat - T_w) / (μ D Ja) )^(1/4) multiplied by 0.943? Or maybe I missed a factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is h = 0.943 * [ (k^3 g ρ (ρ - ρ_v) (T_sat - T_w) ) / (μ^2 Ja) ) ]^(1/4) * (μ/(ρ g D))^(-1/2)

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, I remember that for film condensation on a vertical plate, the average heat transfer coefficient is given by:

h = 0.943 * [ (k^3 g ρ (ρ - ρ_v) (T_sat - T_w)) / (μ^2 Ja D) ) ]^(1/4)

Wait, that would change the denominator. Let me try that.

So, the expression inside would be:

[k^3 g ρ (ρ - ρ_v) (ΔT)] / (μ^2 Ja D)

So let's compute that.

Compute numerator: 0.364^3 * 32.2 * 62.4 * 62.3403 * 20

We already have 0.364^3 * 32.2 * 62.4 * 62.3403 * 20 = 120,940 as before.

Denominator: μ^2 * Ja * D

μ = 0.00031 lbm/ft·hr, so μ^2 is (0.00031)^2 = 9.61e-8 lbm²/ft²·hr²

Ja is 0.01925

D is 0.5 ft

So denominator = 9.61e-8 * 0.01925 * 0.5

Compute 9.61e-8 * 0.01925 = approx 1.85e-9

Multiply by 0.5: 9.27e-10

So the term inside the brackets is 120940 / 9.27e-10 ≈ 1.305e14

Now take the fourth root: (1.305e14)^(1/4) = (1.305)^(1/4) * (1e14)^(1/4) = approx 1.09 * 1e3.5 (since 1e14^(1/4)=1e3.5= 3162.27)

So 1.09 * 3162 ≈ 3447.

Multiply by 0.943: 3447 * 0.943 ≈ 3250 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Hmm, that's much higher than any of the options. So I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong correlation. Let me think again. Maybe the correct formula for vertical surfaces is:

h = 0.943 * [ (k^3 g ρ (ρ_v - ρ_l) (T_sat - T_w) ) / (μ^2 Ja L) ) ]^(1/4)

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the correlation for
