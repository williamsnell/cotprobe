Okay, so I've got this problem here about contention approaches in LANs, specifically CSMA/CD. The question is about calculating the fraction of slots that are wasted because multiple stations try to transmit at the same time. Hmm, I remember that in contention-based methods, when multiple stations try to send data at the same time, it causes collisions, which waste the slot.

The setup: there are 5 stations, and each has a probability of 0.35 to transmit in each slot. So, time is divided into discrete slots, and each station decides to transmit with p=0.35 each slot. I think the key here is to find the probability that more than one station transmits in a slot, which would make the slot wasted.

Wait, right, a slot is wasted if two or more stations try to transmit in the same slot. So the wasted fraction is the probability that the number of transmitting stations is two or more.

So, let's model this. The number of stations transmitting follows a binomial distribution. Each trial is independent, with n=5 trials, and probability p=0.35 each.

We need to find the probability that the number of successes (transmissions) is 2 or more. Alternatively, we can subtract the probability of zero and one transmission from 1.

The binomial probability formula is P(k) = C(n,k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). 

So, first, calculate P(0) and P(1), then sum them and subtract from 1 to get the probability of 2 or more.

Calculating P(0): C(5,0) is 1, p^0 is 1, (1-p)^5 is (0.65)^5.

P(0) = 1 * 1 * (0.65)^5. Let me compute that. 0.65^5. Let's see, 0.65^2 is 0.4225. 0.4225 * 0.65 = approx 0.2746 (0.65 * 0.4225: 0.4225 *0.6=0.2535, 0.4225*0.05=0.021125, total 0.2746). Then 0.2746 * 0.65 is about 0.1785 (0.2746*0.6=0.16476, 0.2746*.05=0.01373; total 0.17849). Then multiply by 0.65 again: 0.17849 * 0.65. 0.1*0.65 is 0.065, 0.07*0.65=0.0455, 0.00849*0.65 is about 0.00552. Adding up: 0.065 +0.0455=0.1105, plus 0.00552 gives ~0.116. So, approximately P(0)=0.116.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me compute 0.65^5.

0.65^1 = 0.65

0.65^2 = 0.4225

0.65^3 = 0.4225 * 0.65 = let's compute 0.4 *0.65=0.26, 0.0225 *0.65=0.014625. Sum: 0.26 +0.014625=0.274625.

0.65^4 = 0.274625 * 0.65 = let's compute 0.2*0.65=0.13, 0.07*0.65=0.0455, 0.004625 *0.65=0.00300625. So sum is 0.13 + 0.0455=0.1755 + 0.00300625=0.17850625.

0.65^5 = 0.17850625 * 0.65. Let's compute 0.1 *0.65=0.065, 0.07*0.65=0.0455, 0.00850625 *0.65. Let's break it down: 0.008 *0.65=0.0052, 0.00050625 *0.65=0.0003288125. So total is 0.065 +0.0455 =0.1105, plus 0.0052=0.1157, plus 0.0003288= approx 0.1157 + 0.0003288 is 0.1160288. So P(0)=0.1160288.

Now, P(1): C(5,1)=5. So 5 * (0.35)^1 * (0.65)^4.

We have (0.35) = 0.35, and (0.65)^4 is 0.17850625, as calculated earlier.

So P(1) =5 * 0.35 * 0.17850625.

Calculating 0.35 * 0.17850625: 0.35 * 0.17 is 0.0595, 0.35 * 0.00850625 is about 0.0029769. So sum ≈0.0624769.

Multiply by 5: 5 * 0.0624769 ≈ 0.3123845.

So P(0)≈0.1160288, P(1)=~0.3123845. Sum P(0)+P(1) = 0.1160288 + 0.3123845 = 0.4284133.

So the probability that two or more stations transmit is 1 - 0.4284133 = 0.5715867.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.572, which is very close to this value. So the answer should be C.

To determine the fraction of slots wasted due to multiple simultaneous transmission attempts in a contention-based LAN with 5 stations, where each station transmits with probability \( p = 0.35 \) in each slot, we model the number of transmitting stations using a binomial distribution. A slot is wasted if two or more stations transmit simultaneously.

The probability of \( k \) stations transmitting in a slot is given by the binomial formula:

\[
P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\]

where \( n = 5 \). To find the fraction of wasted slots, we calculate the probability of two or more stations transmitting, which is:

\[
P(\text{wasted slot}) = 1 - P(0) - P(1)
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( P(0) \) (no stations transmit)
\[
P(0) = \binom{5}{0} p^0 (1-p)^5 = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot (0.65)^5
\]
\[
(0.65)^5 \approx 0.1160288 \quad \Rightarrow \quad P(0) \approx 0.1160288
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(1) \) (one station transmits)
\[
P(1) = \binom{5}{1} p^1 (1-p)^4 = 5 \cdot 0.35 \cdot (0.65)^4
\]
\[
(0.65)^4 \approx 0.17850625, \quad 0.35 \cdot 0.17850625 \approx 0.0624769
\]
\[
P(1) = 5 \cdot 0.0624769 \approx 0.3123845
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( P(\text{wasted slot}) \)
\[
P(\text{wasted slot}) = 1 - P(0) - P(1) = 1 - 0.1160288 - 0.3123845
\]
\[
P(\text{wasted slot}) \approx 1 - 0.4284133 = 0.5715867
\]

### Final Answer
The fraction of slots wasted due to multiple simultaneous transmission attempts is approximately \( 0.572 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
