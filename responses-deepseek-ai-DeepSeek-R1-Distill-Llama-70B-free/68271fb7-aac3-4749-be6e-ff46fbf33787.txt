Okay, so I've got this problem here about a convex lens producing an image on a screen. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let's try to work through this.

The problem says the image is three times as large as the object. Wait, I remember that the magnification (m) is the ratio of image height to object height. So if the image is three times larger, that could mean m is either 3 or -3, right? Because magnification can be positive or negative depending on whether the image is upright or inverted. But wait, convex lenses can produce both real and virtual images. Since the image is on a screen, it must be a real image, which means the magnification is negative. Oh right, because real images are inverted. So m = -3.

Now, the screen is 14.4 cm from the lens. That should be the image distance, v. So v = 14.4 cm. The formula I think I need is the lens formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v, where u is the object distance. But wait, there's another formula involving magnification. Oh right, m = -v/u. Since m is -3, then -3 = -v/u. So 3 = v/u, so u = v/3. Let me plug in the numbers. v is 14.4 cm, so u would be 14.4 /3 = 4.8 cm.

Wait, wait. Wait, the magnification formula is m = -v/u. Oh yeah, that's right. So m = -3 = -v/u → 3 = v/u → u = v/3. So yes, u is 4.8 cm.

Now, plug u and v into the lens formula to find f. So 1/f = 1/u + 1/v = 1/4.8 + 1/14.4. Let me calculate that. 1/4.8 is approximately 0.208333, and 1/14.4 is approximately 0.069444. Adding those together gives about 0.277777. So 1/f ≈ 0.277777. Therefore, f is roughly 3.6 cm. Oh wait, because 1/0.277777 is 3.6. Yeah.

Wait, but wait a second. The question asks for the refracting power, which is the diopter. Diopter is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. So if f is 3.6 cm, that's 0.036 meters. So 1/0.036 is approximately 27.777... diopters. Oh, that's like 27.78 diopters. Looking at the options, option I is 27.78 diopters.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recalculate 1/u +1/v.

u =4.8 cm = 0.048 m. 1/u is 20.8333... per meter. v=14.4 cm=0.144 m. 1/v is 6.9444... per meter. Adding them gives 20.8333 +6.9444 = 27.7777... So 1/f is 27.7777, so f is 1/27.7777 ≈ 0.036 m, which is 3.6 cm. That's correct.

So the refracting power is 27.777..., which is approximately 27.78 diopters. Looking at the options, option I is 27.78. So the answer should be I.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the image is three times as large as the object, which means the magnification \( m = -3 \) (negative because the image is inverted). The screen is 14.4 cm from the lens, so the image distance \( v = 14.4 \, \text{cm} \).

Using the magnification formula \( m = -\frac{v}{u} \), we solve for the object distance \( u \):  
\[
-3 = -\frac{14.4}{u} \implies u = \frac{14.4}{3} = 4.8 \, \text{cm}.
\]

Next, we use the lens formula \( \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} \) to find the focal length \( f \). Substituting \( u = 4.8 \, \text{cm} \) and \( v = 14.4 \, \text{cm} \):  
\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{4.8} + \frac{1}{14.4}.
\]

Converting to meters:  
\[
u = 0.048 \, \text{m}, \quad v = 0.144 \, \text{m}.
\]

Calculating the terms:  
\[
\frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{0.048} \approx 20.8333, \quad \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{0.144} \approx 6.9444.
\]

Adding these together:  
\[
\frac{1}{f} = 20.8333 + 6.9444 = 27.7777.
\]

Thus, the focal length is:  
\[
f = \frac{1}{27.7777} \approx 0.036 \, \text{m} = 3.6 \, \text{cm}.
\]

The refracting power of the lens is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters:  
\[
\text{Refracting power} = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{0.036} \approx 27.78 \, \text{diopters}.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **I: 27.78 diopters**.
