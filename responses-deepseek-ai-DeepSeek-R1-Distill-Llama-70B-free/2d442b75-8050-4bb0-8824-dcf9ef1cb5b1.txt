Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question describes an adiabatic system that's open to the atmosphere. The atmospheric pressure is given as 14.7 psia, which I think is standard atmospheric pressure.

The system contains two substances: 1.0 lbm of ice at 32°F and 6.0 lbm of liquid water at 80°F. Oh wait, ice and water together. And the process is adiabatic, so no heat transfer with the surroundings, right? But wait, the system is open, so mass can transfer? Or maybe it's just that the system is open but mass isn't necessarily moving in or out. Hmm, wait, in thermodynamics, adiabatic means Q=0, and "open" usually means mass can cross the boundary. But in this case, maybe the system is just the mixture, and being open to the atmosphere, but since it's adiabatic, I'm not sure if that affects anything. Maybe it's just a way to say the pressure is atmospheric? I'm a bit confused, but I'll proceed.

The problem gives me the specific heat Cp as 1.0 Btu/lbm-°F for water, and the latent heat of fusion for ice is 144 Btu/lbm. I need to find the final temperature of the system after this adiabatic process and the change in entropy.

Wait, so the system is adiabatic, but the process is spontaneous. So probably, heat is being exchanged between the ice and the warmer water. Since the system is adiabatic, the heat lost by the warmer water will be gained by the ice. But also, the ice will melt, right? Because it's at 32°F, which is its melting point, and the water is at a higher temperature, so heat will flow from the water to the ice, causing the ice to melt and the water to cool down.

So, this seems like a heat transfer problem where the heat released by the cooling water is used to melt the ice and possibly raise the temperature of the melted ice.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the heat available from the liquid water as it cools down to some final temperature T.
2. Calculate the heat required to melt the ice and then bring it up to temperature T.
3. Since the system is adiabatic, the heat lost by the water should equal the heat gained by the ice (plus any changes from melting).
4. Set up an equation where the heat lost by the water equals the heat gained by the ice and solve for T.

Wait, but the problem says it's an adiabatic process. So the system as a whole doesn't exchange heat with the surroundings, but internally, heat is transferred. So the heat lost by the warm water will be absorbed by the ice.

So, the heat lost by the water (as it cools from 80°F to T) will be equal to the heat gained by the ice (to melt it and then bring it up to T).

Let me write that equation:

Heat lost by water = Heat to melt ice + Heat to raise temperature of melted ice.

Mathematically, that would be:

m_water * Cp * (T_initial_water - T_final) = m_ice * h_fusion + m_ice * Cp * (T_final - T_ice_initial)

Wait, but the ice is initially at 32°F, which is the melting point. So when it melts, it becomes water at 32°F, and then this water can be heated to T_final.

So, the equation becomes:

m_water * Cp * (T_water_initial - T_final) = m_ice * h_fusion + m_ice * Cp * (T_final - T_ice_initial)

But wait, T_ice_initial is 32°F, same as the melting point. So the term (T_final - 32) would be the change for the melted ice.

Let me plug in the numbers. m_water is 6 lbm, m_ice is 1 lbm. Cp is 1.0 Btu/lbm-°F. h_fusion is 144 Btu/lbm.

So,

6 lbm * 1.0 Btu/lbm-°F * (80°F - T) = 1 lbm * 144 Btu/lbm + 1 lbm * 1.0 Btu/lbm-°F * (T -32°F)

Let me compute each part.

Left side: 6*(80 - T) = 6*(80 - T)

Right side: 144 + (T -32)

So the equation is:

6*(80 - T) = 144 + (T - 32)

Let me expand both sides.

Left: 480 - 6T

Right: 144 + T -32 → 112 + T

So:

480 -6T = 112 + T

Bring variables to one side and constants to the other:

480 -112 = 6T + T → 368 =7T → T=368/7 ≈52.571°F. Hmm, approximately 52.57°F.

Looking at the options, option F is 52.6°F. So that's the final temperature.

Now, the second part is the change in entropy. Since the process is adiabatic, the entropy change of the system is due to internal processes. However, wait, the system is adiabatic but the process is spontaneous and irreversible. So the total entropy change (system + surroundings) would increase, but in this case, since the system is adiabatic and the process is internal, the entropy change is for the system only.

Wait, the system includes both the ice and the water. So the entropy change is the sum of the entropy change of the water and the entropy change of the ice.

Entropy is a state function, so we can calculate the change for each.

For the water: it cools from 80°F to 52.57°F. The change in entropy is m * Cp * ln(T_final / T_initial), but wait, temperature must be in absolute scale. So I need to convert to Rankine.

Wait, no, the formula for entropy change when temperature changes is ΔS = m Cp ln(T2/T1), but only if it's at constant pressure, which it is here since it's open to atmosphere, so pressure is constant. So that works.

Similarly, for the ice: it melts and then warms up. But wait, the entropy change when melting is Q / T, where Q is the heat absorbed (m h_fusion) and T is the melting temperature in absolute scale.

Wait, but also, after melting, the water (from ice) will increase in temperature to T_final. So the entropy change for the ice is two parts: melting and heating.

So, let's compute each part.

First, compute for the water:

Initial T_water: 80°F → 80 + 459.67 = 539.67 R
Final T_water: 52.57°F → 52.57 + 459.67 = 512.24 R

ΔS_water = m_water * Cp * ln(T_final / T_initial)
=6 lbm * 1.0 Btu/lbm-°R * ln(512.24 / 539.67)
Wait, but wait, because the water is cooling, so T_final < T_initial, so ln(...) will be negative. So the entropy of the water decreases.

Wait, but the ice is melting and increasing in entropy. Let me compute each part.

Compute entropy change for the water:

ΔS_water = 6 * 1.0 * ln(512.24 / 539.67)
=6 * ln(0.9484)
≈6 * (-0.0535) ≈-0.321 Btu/°R

Now, for the ice:

First, the entropy change when melting. Since it's at the melting point, T =32°F = 491.67 R.

ΔS_melt = m_ice * h_fusion / T_melt
=1 lbm *144 Btu/lbm /491.67 R
≈144 /491.67 ≈0.2926 Btu/°R

Then, the melted water (1 lbm) is heated from 32°F to 52.57°F.

ΔS_heat = m_ice * Cp * ln(T_final / T_initial)
=1 *1.0 * ln(512.24 / 491.67)
= ln(1.0422) ≈0.0413 Btu/°R

So total ΔS_ice = 0.2926 + 0.0413 ≈0.3339 Btu/°R

So the total entropy change of the system is ΔS_water + ΔS_ice = (-0.321) + 0.3339 ≈0.0129 Btu/°R

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one is option F, which has a change in entropy of +0.021 Btu/°R. Hmm, but my calculation gives about 0.0129. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check my calculations.

Let me recheck the temperatures in Rankine.

T_initial_water =80°F = 80 +459.67=539.67 R

T_final =52.57°F →512.24 R.

So ln(512.24/539.67)=ln(0.9484)=approx -0.0535.

ΔS_water=6 * (-0.0535)= -0.321.

For the ice: 

h_fusion is 144 Btu/lbm, T is 32°F=491.67 R.

ΔS_melt=1*144 /491.67=approx 0.2926.

Then, heating from 32°F (491.67 R) to 52.57°F (512.24 R):

ln(512.24/491.67)=ln(1.0422)= approx 0.0413.

So 0.2926 +0.0413=0.3339.

Total entropy change: -0.321 +0.3339 ≈0.0129. So approximately 0.013.

Looking at the options, option F has a change of +0.021, which is larger. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the entropy. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the water's entropy change correctly. Let me compute ln(512.24/539.67) precisely.

Wait, 512.24 / 539.67 is approximately 0.9484.

The natural logarithm of 0.9484 is approximately -0.0535, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the specific heat for the ice? No, because ice's specific heat isn't given. Oh wait, does ice have a different specific heat? The problem states C_p is for water, but perhaps ice has a different value. The problem doesn't provide it, so maybe I shouldn't consider heating the ice before it melts. Wait, no, because the ice is already at 32°F. When it melts, it becomes water at 32°F, which then heats up. So no, the initial phase is ice at 32°F.

Wait, another point: in the entropy calculation for melting, the formula is correct. Now, when the ice melts, it's at 32°F, so T is 491.67 R, correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the entropy change for the heating of the melted water. Let me compute that again.

ΔS_heat = 1 lbm *1.0 Btu/lbm-°R * ln(512.24/491.67)
=1 *1.0 * ln(1.0422) → which is approximately 0.0413.

So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem expects me to consider the entropy of the surroundings? No, the problem states it's an adiabatic system. Wait, no, the system is the ice and water. The surroundings are not part of the system, so their entropy change isn't included. So the total system's entropy change is what I calculated, which is about 0.013.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: +0.018, but that's with a final temp of 60.5°F, which doesn't match. Option F is 52.6°F with +0.021. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the heat transfer equation? Let me recheck that.

Wait, the heat lost by the water is m * Cp * (T_initial - T_final). The heat gained is m_ice * h_fusion + m_ice * Cp * (T_final - T_ice_initial).

Wait, in the equation:

6*(80 - T) =144 + (T -32)

Wait, 6*(80 - T) =144 + (T -32)
480 -6T =112 + T → 480-112=7T → 368=7T → T=52.571°F, correct.

So that's right.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as considering the ice's specific heat? No, since the ice is at 32°F, and upon melting, the heat is h_fusion, and then the water from ice is heated. The specific heat for ice isn't given, so I can't include any temperature change for ice before melting. So I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the entropy calculation for the ice's heating is wrong. Let me recompute it.

Wait, the melted water goes from 32°F to 52.57°F. The entropy change is m*Cp*ln(T2/T1). So T1 is 32°F=491.67 R, T2=52.57°F=512.24 R.

So ln(512.24/491.67)=ln(1.0422)≈0.0413.

Yes, correct.

So sum of all entropy changes is about 0.0129. The options don't have exactly that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me think again.

The water is cooling, so its entropy decreases: ΔS_water is negative.

The ice melts and warms, so ΔS_ice is positive.

So total entropy change is positive 0.0129, approximately 0.013.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F, which has a ΔS of +0.021. But that's a bigger value. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate more precisely.

Let me compute the ln values more accurately.

For the water:

T_initial_water = 539.67 R

T_final =512.24 R

Ratio:512.24/539.67=0.94836.

ln(0.94836)=?

Let me use calculator input: 

ln(0.94836)= approx -0.05346.

So ΔS_water=6 * (-0.05346)= -0.3208 ≈-0.3208.

For the ice:

ΔS_melt=144 /491.67= 0.2926.

ΔS_heat=1 *1.0 * ln(512.24/491.67)= ln(1.0422)= approx 0.04125.

So total ΔS_ice=0.2926+0.04125=0.33385.

Total ΔS= -0.3208 +0.33385=0.01305≈0.013 Btu/°R.

Hmm, the options don't have this exact value. But looking at the options, option C is +0.028, F is +0.021, B is +0.030, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake by using Cp for water in the entropy calculation. Because the ice's specific heat isn't given, perhaps we should neglect the entropy change of the melted ice as it heats up. But that doesn't make sense because the melted ice does increase in temperature, which would contribute to entropy increase.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the heat transfer equation. Let me think again.

Wait, the equation I set up assumes all the heat from the water goes into melting the ice and heating it. But the problem is adiabatic, so that's correct. So the heat lost by the water is equal to the heat gained by the ice (melting and heating).

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the ice can only melt until the water cools to 32°F, but that doesn't make sense because the water can cool below that, but wait, no, because ice can't exist below 32°F unless under pressure, but the system is under atmospheric pressure. So the lowest the water can cool is 32°F, but in this case, the ice would have melted, and the water would have cooled to 32°F. But that's not the case here because the heat from the water is sufficient to melt all the ice and raise the temperature.

Wait, no, the process is such that the ice melts, increasing the mass of water, and the final temperature is higher than 32°F. So the initial setup is correct.

Wait, but maybe I should compute the entropy more precisely. Let me try to calculate the entropy again.

Compute each term with more precise numbers.

First, for the water:

ΔS_water =6 lbm *1.0 Btu/lbm-°R * ln(512.24/539.67)

Compute 512.24 divided by 539.67:

512.24 /539.67 ≈0.94836.

ln(0.94836)=?

Let me look up ln(0.94836). Alternatively, I can compute it using Taylor series or a calculator.

Using calculator: ln(0.94836) ≈-0.05346.

So ΔS_water=6 * (-0.05346)= -0.32076 ≈-0.3208 Btu/°R.

For the ice:

ΔS_melt =1 lbm *144 Btu/lbm /491.67 R =144/491.67 ≈0.2926 Btu/°R.

Then, heating from 32°F (491.67 R) to 52.57°F (512.24 R):

ΔS_heat =1 *1.0 * ln(512.24/491.67)= ln(1.0422)= approximately 0.04125.

So total ΔS_ice=0.2926 +0.04125=0.33385 Btu/°R.

Total entropy change: ΔS_water +ΔS_ice= (-0.3208)+0.33385=0.01305 Btu/°R, which is about +0.013.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match. The closest is option F, which is final temp 52.6°F and ΔS=+0.021. But my calculation is 0.013, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the latent heat is negative? Because the system is losing heat when the ice melts. No, the latent heat of fusion is given as 144 Btu/lbm, which is the
