Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with kinetics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the thermal decomposition of a compound in the gas phase. The compound is (CH3)3COOC(CH3)3, which I think is called t-butyl peroxide or something like that. It decomposes into acetone, (CH3)2CO, and ethane, C2H6. The reaction starts at 1.0 atm, and the rate constant is given as 0.0019 s^-1. They're asking at what time the pressure would be 1.8 atm.

Hmm, I remember that for gas-phase reactions, pressure changes can be related to the extent of reaction. Oh right, because when a gas reacts and produces more moles of gas, the pressure increases. So I need to figure out how the pressure changes over time based on the reaction.

First, let's write the balanced chemical equation. The reactant is (CH3)3COOC(CH3)3. Wait, that's di-t-butyl peroxide. When it decomposes, it forms two molecules of acetone and one molecule of ethane. Or wait, no, maybe I should balance the equation properly.

Wait, let me think. The molecule is (CH3)3CO-O-C(CH3)3. When it decomposes, each O-O bond breaks maybe. So each molecule might split into two parts. Let me see: the decomposition of di-t-butyl peroxide produces two acetone molecules? Or maybe each peroxide group breaks into an acetone and something else.

Wait, I think the correct products are two acetone molecules and ethane. Let me try to write it:

(CH3)3COOC(CH3)3 → 2 (CH3)2CO + C2H6

Wait, let me check the formula. Di-t-butyl peroxide is [(CH3)3CO]2O, which might decompose into two (CH3)2CO and maybe ethane? Or wait, maybe each (CH3)3CO becomes (CH3)2CO and something else. Alternatively, perhaps each O in the peroxide breaks, leading to two acetone molecules and one ethane.

Wait, maybe I should count the carbons. The peroxide is (CH3)3CO-O-C(CH3)3. So each side of the O is a t-butoxy group. When it decomposes, each t-butoxy (CH3)3CO· would decompose. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

(CH3)3COOC(CH3)3 → 2 (CH3)2CO + C2H6 ?

Wait, let's see the molecular formulas. Di-t-butyl peroxide is C8H18O2. Acetone is (CH3)2CO, which is C3H6O. So two moles of acetone would be 2*(C3H6O)= C6H12O2. Ethane is C2H6. So combining 2 acetone and 1 ethane gives C8H18O2, which matches the di-t-butyl peroxide. So the balanced equation is correct.

So the reaction is: (CH3)3COOC(CH3)3 → 2 (CH3)2CO + C2H6.

Now, considering the stoichiometry, one mole of reactant produces three moles of products (2 + 1). So for every mole that reacts, the total moles increase by 2 (since 1 becomes 3, so increase of 2). So the pressure increases accordingly.

Initially, the pressure is 1.0 atm. As the reaction proceeds, the pressure increases because more moles of gas are formed.

Wait, the problem states that the initial pressure is 1.0 atm, but I'm assuming that it's the pressure of the pure reactant, right? Because if it's a mixture, that's a different story, but the problem says it's 1.0 atm of the reactant, so that's the starting point.

Let me model this. Let's let the initial pressure be P0 = 1.0 atm. Let x be the extent of reaction in atm. So, at time t, the pressure of the reactant is (1.0 - x) atm. The products are 2x of acetone and x of ethane. So the total pressure P_total is:

P_total = (1.0 - x) + 2x + x = 1.0 + 2x.

Because (1-x) is the reactant, and 2x from acetone, x from ethane adds up to 3x. So 1.0 - x + 3x = 1.0 + 2x.

Wait, wait, no. Let me recalculate that. If the reactant is (1 - x), then the products are 2x (from acetone) and x (from ethane). So total pressure is (1 - x) + 2x + x = 1 + 2x. Because 1 - x + 3x = 1 + 2x. So that's correct.

The problem asks when the pressure is 1.8 atm. So set 1 + 2x = 1.8 → 2x = 0.8 → x = 0.4 atm.

So x is 0.4 atm. Now, how to relate x to time.

The reaction is a first-order reaction because the rate constant has units s^-1, which is typical for first-order. So the rate law is rate = k [A], where A is the concentration of the reactant.

In terms of pressure, because it's a gas, we can use the partial pressure instead of concentration. Since the reaction is first-order, the integrated rate law is ln([A]0/[A]) = kt.

But in terms of pressure, since it's proportional to concentration, we can write ln(P_A0 / P_A) = kt.

Wait, P_A0 is initial pressure of the reactant, which is 1.0 atm. P_A is the pressure at time t, which is (1.0 - x) = 1.0 - 0.4 = 0.6 atm.

So ln(1.0 / 0.6) = kt.

Compute ln(1/0.6) = ln(5/3) ≈ ln(1.6667) ≈ 0.5108.

k is 0.0019 s^-1. So 0.5108 = 0.0019 * t → t = 0.5108 / 0.0019 ≈ ?

Let me calculate: 0.5108 / 0.0019.

Well, 0.0019 is 19e-4. Let's compute 0.5108 / 0.0019:

0.5108 / 0.0019 = (510.8 / 19) ≈ 26.893.

Wait, 19 * 26 = 494, 19*26.8 = 19*(26 +0.8)= 494 + 15.2=509.2. 19*26.89=509.2 + (19*0.09)= 509.2 +1.71=510.91. So 26.89 is approximately 26.89, so 26.89 *19=510.91, which is about 0.5108, so 26.89 s? Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the hundreds.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 0.5108 divided by 0.0019 is 0.5108 / 0.0019 = (0.5108 * 1000) / (0.0019 * 1000) )= 510.8 /1.9 ≈ 269 seconds.

Ah, yes, because 0.5108 /0.0019 is the same as 510.8 /1.9, which is approximately 269 s.

Looking at the options, option I is 269 s.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I make mistakes.

So, the reaction is first-order, so ln([A]0/[A])=kt.

[A]0 is 1.0, and [A] is 0.6, so ln(1.0/0.6) = ln(5/3) ≈ 0.5108.

k is 0.0019 s^-1.

t = 0.5108 / 0.0019 ≈ 269 s.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option I: 269 s.

The question involves the gas-phase thermal decomposition of di-t-butyl peroxide, $(\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COO})_2$, which produces acetone, $(\mathrm{CH}_3)_2\mathrm{CO}$, and ethane, $\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_6$. The reaction is first-order, with a rate constant of $k = 0.0019 \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The goal is to determine the time at which the total pressure reaches $1.8 \, \mathrm{atm}$, starting from an initial pressure of $1.0 \, \mathrm{atm}$.

The balanced chemical equation is:

\[
(\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{COO})_2 \rightarrow 2 (\mathrm{CH}_3)_2\mathrm{CO} + \mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_6
\]

From the stoichiometry, one mole of reactant produces three moles of products (2 moles of acetone and 1 mole of ethane), resulting in a net increase of 2 moles of gas per mole of reactant. The total pressure at any time $t$ can be expressed as:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{reactant}} + P_{\text{products}}
\]

Let $x$ represent the extent of reaction in atm. The pressure of the reactant decreases to $(1.0 - x)$, while the pressures of acetone and ethane are $2x$ and $x$, respectively. Thus, the total pressure is:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = (1.0 - x) + 2x + x = 1.0 + 2x
\]

The problem specifies that the total pressure is $1.8 \, \mathrm{atm}$. Setting $P_{\text{total}} = 1.8$, we solve for $x$:

\[
1.0 + 2x = 1.8 \implies 2x = 0.8 \implies x = 0.4 \, \mathrm{atm}
\]

For a first-order reaction, the integrated rate law is:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_{\text{reactant, initial}}}{P_{\text{reactant, final}}}\right) = kt
\]

Here, $P_{\text{reactant, initial}} = 1.0 \, \mathrm{atm}$ and $P_{\text{reactant, final}} = 1.0 - x = 1.0 - 0.4 = 0.6 \, \mathrm{atm}$. Substituting these values:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1.0}{0.6}\right) = 0.0019t
\]

\[
\ln(1.6667) \approx 0.5108 = 0.0019t
\]

Solving for $t$:

\[
t = \frac{0.5108}{0.0019} \approx 269 \, \mathrm{s}
\]

Thus, the time at which the pressure reaches $1.8 \, \mathrm{atm}$ is approximately $269 \, \mathrm{s}$. The correct answer is:

I: 269 s
