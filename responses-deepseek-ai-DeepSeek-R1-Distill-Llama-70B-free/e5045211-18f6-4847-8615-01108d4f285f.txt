Okay, so I have this question about a convergent lens used as a simple microscopic lens, and I need to find the angular magnification compared to print at the usual reading distance of 40 cm. Let me try to break this down.

First, the lens has a refractive power of +15.00 diopters. I remember that refractive power is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. So if the power is 15 diopters, the focal length f should be 1/15 meters, which is approximately 0.0667 meters or 6.67 centimeters. Oh wait, I need to remember the units correctly because the reading distance is given in centimeters.

The question is about angular magnification. I think the formula for the angular magnification of a simple microscope is M = (25 cm) / f, but wait, wait. Or is it M = 1 + (25 cm) / f? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the simple microscope formula... Oh right, the angular magnification M is given by M = (25 cm) / f when the image is at infinity, which is the case for maximum magnification. Because when you hold the lens close to your eye and focus on the near object, the virtual image is formed at infinity, allowing the eye to relax. So yeah, M = 25/f, but wait, wait, no, wait. Another thought: I think the formula is actually M = 1 + (D * 25 cm), where D is the diopter. Because D is 1/f in meters, so f is 1/D.

Wait, maybe I should write the formulas more clearly. So the angular magnification M for a simple microscope when the image is at infinity is given by M = (25 cm) / f. Since the object is placed just inside the focal point (so that the image is at infinity), the magnification is just the ratio of the near distance (25 cm) to the focal length.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up two different formulas. Oh, right! Another version: the magnification is M = (d)/(f) + 1, but that's when the image is at the near point. Wait, no, perhaps I should clarify.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The simple microscope, or the magnifying glass, has two scenarios: when the image is at infinity (relaxed viewing) and when it's at the near point (maximum magnification). 

In the case where the image is at infinity, the object is placed at the focal point. So the magnification M is given by M = 25 cm / f. Because the angular size is determined by the ratio of the object's size at the near distance to the object's size at the focal point.

Wait, no, maybe that's not exactly right. Wait, the angular magnification M is the ratio of the angle subtended by the object when viewed through the lens to the angle subtended when viewed with the naked eye at the near point.

So when the object is placed at the focal point, the image is at infinity. So the angular size is then (object height)/(f) for the lens. But the unaided eye would see the object at 25 cm. So the angular magnification M is (25 cm)/f.

Wait, but I think I saw a formula where M = 1 + (25 cm)/f. Because when the image is formed at the near point, that's when the maximum magnification occurs, and that formula would apply.

Wait, let me get this straight. The simple magnifier can be used in two modes: 

1. When the image is formed at infinity (relaxed eye), magnification is M = (25 cm)/f.

2. When the image is formed at the near point (maximum magnification), M = 1 + (25 cm)/f.

But wait, I think I might have that the other way around. Because when the image is at infinity, the object is at the focal point, and the magnification is just (25/f). But when the image is at the near point, the object is closer than the focal point, and the magnification is higher, so it's 1 + (25/f).

Wait, that makes more sense. So for the maximum magnification, M is 1 + (25/f) diopters.

But the question says, "compared to print at the usual reading distance of 40 cm." Wait, wait a minute. Wait, the usual reading distance is 25 cm, isn't it? Because I've always heard that the near point is about 25 cm. So why is the question saying 40 cm? Hmm, this could be a point of confusion.

Wait, wait. Let me read the question again. It says, "compared to print at the usual reading distance of 40 cm." Oh, so the usual reading distance here is 40 cm, not 25 cm. So I think the formula would then adjust accordingly. So I need to use 40 cm instead of the usual 25 cm.

So, the angular magnification M would be (40 cm) / f, assuming the image is at infinity, which is the case for a simple microscope. Because with the simple microscope, the object is placed just inside the focal length, so the image is at infinity, allowing the eye to view it without accommodation.

Wait, but if the usual reading distance is 40 cm, then the formula should be M = (reading distance) / f. So M = 40 cm / f. 

But wait, no. Let me think again. The angular magnification is the ratio of the angle with the lens to the angle without. Without the lens, the print is viewed at 40 cm. So the angle without the lens is determined by the size of the print at 40 cm. With the lens, the object is placed at the focal point, so the image is at infinity, making the angle θ = h / f, where h is the object height. Without the lens, the angle would be h / (40 cm). So the magnification M is (h/f) / (h/40 cm) ) = (40 cm)/f.

So yes, M = (40 cm) / f.

Now, since the lens has a power of 15 diopters, which is 1/f in meters, so f = 1/15 m = 0.066666... meters, which is 6.666... centimeters.

So plugging in, M = 40 cm / 6.666... cm ≈ 6.0. So the magnification would be approximately 6.0.

Wait, but wait. Let me recalculate. 40 divided by 6.666 is 6 exactly. Because 6.666 is 20/3. So 40/(20/3) = 40 * 3/20 = 6.

So the angular magnification is 6.0, which would be option D.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't confuse the formula. Another approach: the power D is 15 D, so f = 1/15 m = 6.666 cm.

So M = (near distance) / f = 40 cm / 6.666 cm ≈6.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be D:6.0.

To determine the angular magnification of a convergent lens with a refractive power of +15.00 diopters used as a simple microscopic lens, we start by calculating the focal length \( f \). Since refractive power \( D \) is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters, we have:

\[
f = \frac{1}{D} = \frac{1}{15} \, \text{m} = 0.0667 \, \text{m} = 6.67 \, \text{cm}.
\]

The angular magnification \( M \) of a simple microscope is given by:

\[
M = \frac{\text{reading distance}}{f},
\]

where the reading distance is the usual distance at which the eye views the object without the lens. In this case, the reading distance is specified as 40 cm. Substituting the values:

\[
M = \frac{40 \, \text{cm}}{6.67 \, \text{cm}} \approx 6.0.
\]

Thus, the angular magnification produced by the lens compared to print at the usual reading distance of 40 cm is approximately **6.0**.

The correct answer is:

**D: 6.0**
