The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A shopper in a store sees that a display case is about to fall on a second shopper's head. The shopper does nothing to warn or assist the second shopper, who is a stranger to her. She could have taken action to protect the second shopper without harming herself. Did the shopper have a duty to take action to try and protect the second shopper from injury?

Options:

A: No, the shopper is not required to intervene unless she is a store employee or security personnel.
B: Yes, the shopper must take action under the "Good Samaritan" law.
C: Yes, the fact that a person sees that action is needed for another's aid or protection does impose a legal duty to act.
D: No, there is no duty for a shopper to render assistance to a stranger even if it can be done without hurting herself.
E: Yes, the shopper is legally obligated to intervene because she was the first person to notice the danger.
F: Yes, the shopper is legally obligated to intervene in any potentially harmful situation.
G: Yes, the shopper must take action under the "last clear chance" doctrine.
H: No, a failure to act does not and cannot result in liability under any circumstances.
I: No, the shopper is not required to intervene unless she has a special relationship with the person in danger.
J: No, the shopper has no duty to act unless she directly caused the danger.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let's see what it says. 

The situation is about a shopper who sees a display case about to fall on another shopper. The first shopper does nothing to warn or help, even though she could have acted without harming herself. The question is whether she had a duty to act.

Hmm, I remember that in tort law, there's something about the duty to rescue or the Good Samaritan laws. Wait, but I think most places don't require people to help others in distress unless certain conditions are met. Like, if you're somehow responsible for the danger or have a special relationship with the person in danger, like being a parent or a professional.

So the options are A through J. Let me go through them.

Option A says no, unless she's an employee or security. I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe employees have more duties, but I don't think that's the main point here.

Option B says yes, under Good Samaritan law. Wait, Good Samaritan laws usually protect people who do help from liability, not require them to help. So B might be incorrect.

Option C says yes, seeing the need imposes a duty. That doesn't sound right because generally, there's no duty to rescue unless specific conditions apply.

Option D says no, no duty to help a stranger. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier. Generally, no legal duty unless certain exceptions.

Option E says yes, because she noticed first. I don't think being first to notice creates a duty. It's more about the relationship or causing the harm.

Option F says yes, any potentially harmful situation. That seems too broad; I don't think the law requires intervention in every possible situation.

Option G: Last clear chance doctrine. I think that's more about negligence in allowing harm after someone else had a chance to prevent it, but not sure if it applies here.

Option H: No liability ever. Well, that's too extreme. There are cases where not acting can lead to liability, like if you caused the danger.

Option I: No duty unless special relationship. That sounds correct. Like, if she's a parent, or maybe if she has a professional duty, but as a stranger, no.

Option J: No duty unless she caused danger. That's another exception. If she caused the danger, she would have a duty to act. But here, she didn't cause it, so J would apply.

Wait, so the question says she didn't cause the danger. So according to J, she has no duty. But I thought I also had the special relationship exception. So which applies here?

In the scenario, the second shopper is a stranger. So the special relationship (I) would say no duty. And since she didn't cause the danger (J), also no duty.

So looking back at the options, D says no duty to assist a stranger. I says no duty unless special relationship.

Wait, so which is correct? I think the general rule is that there's no duty to rescue a stranger. So the correct answer would be D or I.

But wait, option I says unless she has a special relationship. So if she doesn't, then no duty. So in this case, since it's a stranger, I's condition isn't met, so no duty.

So the answer would be either D or I.

Wait, but the question is whether she had a duty. So the correct answer would be that she does not have a duty because there's no special relationship and she didn't cause the danger.

Looking back at the options, D says "No, there is no duty for a shopper to render assistance to a stranger even if she can do so without hurt." That sounds correct.

But option I says "No, unless she has a special relationship." So both D and I could be correct, but depending on how the options are phrased.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual legal principle. The general rule is that there's no duty to rescue a stranger in peril unless a statute imposes such a duty, which is rare. So without a special relationship or causing the danger, no duty.

So the options are D and I. Let me read them again.

D: No, no duty to render assistance to a stranger.

I: No, unless special relationship.

So which applies here? The question is about a stranger, so both D and I could apply. But I think the general answer is that there's no duty unless certain exceptions, which include special relationship or causing the danger.

So the correct answer would be either D or I. But let me think about the options given.

Wait, option C says yes, the fact that a person sees the need imposes a duty. I don't think that's correct because that would mean everyone has a duty to act whenever they see someone in need, which isn't the case.

So the correct answer is either D or I. But looking back, the question is whether the shopper had a duty. Since she is a stranger and didn't cause the danger, the answer is no.

So in the options, D and I are both "No." But the reasoning differs. D is about strangers, I about special relationships.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D or I. Let me think of the standard tort answer. The traditional rule is that there's no duty to rescue. So the correct answer is D: No, there's no duty to render assistance to a stranger.

Wait, but another thought: Some jurisdictions might have laws requiring people to act, but generally, the common law rule is no duty unless specific circumstances.

So in the options, D is correct. Alternatively, I could be correct if the reasoning is based on special relationships. But the question is about a stranger without any special relationship, so both D and I would apply. But the options are exclusive, so I need to choose the best answer.

Wait, the options are A through J, and only one is correct.

Looking again, the question is whether she had a duty. The general rule is no, unless exceptions (special relationship, caused the danger, etc.). So the correct answer is that there's no duty because she's a stranger and didn't cause it.

So the options that say "No" are A, D, H, I, J.

From these, D says no duty to a stranger, I says no unless special relationship.

So the correct answer is either D or I.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D because it specifically addresses strangers, while I is about the relationship.

But I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about which option is more accurate in law.

In most common law jurisdictions, there is no general duty to rescue. So the correct answer would be D: No, no duty to render assistance to a stranger.

So I think the answer is D or I. Wait, but looking back, the question is about a duty. So if she didn't have a special relationship and didn't cause the danger, then no duty.

So the correct answer is D: No, there is no duty for a shopper to render assistance to a stranger even if it can be done without hurting herself.

Wait, but another angle: Some might argue that if you can easily prevent harm, you have a duty. But I don't think that's the case in general. It's more of a moral obligation, not a legal one.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.

The question revolves around whether a shopper has a legal duty to intervene when she sees another shopper in danger. The key issue is whether there is a legal obligation to act in such circumstances. 

Under common law, there is generally no duty to rescue a stranger unless specific exceptions apply, such as having a special relationship with the person in danger (e.g., parent-child, doctor-patient) or being responsible for causing the danger. In this scenario, the shopper is a stranger to the person in danger, and there is no indication that she caused the danger. Therefore, the general rule applies: there is no legal duty to render assistance to a stranger.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The duty to act is not limited to store employees or security personnel; the question is about a general shopper.
- **B**: Incorrect. Good Samaritan laws typically protect those who act from liability, not impose a duty to act.
- **C**: Incorrect. Seeing the need for assistance does not, by itself, impose a legal duty to act.
- **D**: Correct. This aligns with the general rule that there is no duty to render assistance to a stranger unless specific exceptions apply.
- **E**: Incorrect. Being the first to notice the danger does not create a legal duty to act.
- **F**: Incorrect. The law does not require intervention in every potentially harmful situation.
- **G**: Incorrect. The "last clear chance" doctrine is not relevant here.
- **H**: Incorrect. While there is generally no duty to act, this option is too broad in stating that a failure to act can never result in liability.
- **I**: Incorrect. While the absence of a special relationship is a valid reason for no duty, this option is less specific than D, which directly addresses the lack of duty to strangers.
- **J**: Incorrect. The shopper did not cause the danger, so this exception does not apply.

The most accurate answer is **D**, as it directly addresses the lack of duty to assist a stranger in the absence of specific exceptions.

Answer: D
