Okay, so I've got this problem about removing carbon dioxide from an aqueous solution using an air stream in a wetted wall column. I'm a bit rusty on mass transfer concepts, but let's try to think this through.

The question gives me some parameters: the air is flowing at 3.0 ft/sec, the column has an internal diameter of 3 inches, and at a certain point, the CO2 concentration in the air is 1 mole percent while in the water it's 0.5 mole percent. The column is operated at 10 atm and 80°F. I need to find the gas-phase mass transfer coefficient (kg?) and the mass flux at that point.

Hmm, I remember that mass transfer involves the movement of molecules from a region of higher concentration to lower. Here, CO2 is in both the gas (air) and liquid (water) phases. The mass transfer coefficient probably relates to how quickly this transfer happens.

Wait, the gas-phase mass transfer coefficient is usually denoted as kg or sometimes k_g. Oh right, it's the mass transfer coefficient for the gas phase. The formula I think is kg = (D * Sc)^(-1/2) * velocity, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's using the Sherwood number or something like that?

Wait, another approach: the mass transfer can be calculated using the equation N = kg * (y - y*) where y* is the equilibrium concentration. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, for a wetted wall column, the mass transfer coefficient might be determined using the correlation for a falling film or something like that.

Wait, the wetted wall column is a type where the liquid flows down as a thin film, and the gas flows upward. So maybe the correlation for kg is applicable here. I think there's a specific correlation for this setup. Let me try to recall.

I think the mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase can be estimated using the equation kg = (D_gas / d) * (Re)^0.5 * (Sc)^0.3. Or wait, maybe it's kg = (D_gas) * (velocity) / (diameter) ) * some function of Reynolds and Schmidt numbers. Alternatively, the equation might involve the square root of velocity or something like that.

Wait, another thought: the mass transfer coefficient kg can be found using the penetration theory, which might involve the square root of (velocity) and the diameter, but I'm not clear on that.

Alternatively, maybe the correlation is kg = 0.25 * (G) / (μ_gas) )^0.5 * (μ_gas / (ρ_gas * D_gas)) )^(1/3). No, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, maybe I should look up the correlation for a wetted wall column in the context of gas absorption. Oh wait, I can't look things up right now. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that in a wetted wall column, the liquid flows as a film on the wall, and the gas flows through the core. The mass transfer coefficient in the gas phase (kg) is given by:

kg = (D_gas / (π * D)) * ( (4 * G) / (μ_gas)) )^(1/2) * (μ_gas / (ρ_gas * D_gas)) )^(-1/6)

Wait, I'm not sure. Another approach: the mass transfer coefficient kg can be determined using kg = (Sh) * (D_gas) / (diameter). And the Sherwood number (Sh) for a wetted wall column in the gas phase is often given by Sh = 0.25 * Re_gas^0.5 * Sc^0.3, where Re is the Reynolds number and Sc is the Schmidt number.

Wait, let's outline the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate the Reynolds number for the gas phase.
2. Use a correlation to find the Sherwood number (Sh).
3. From Sh, calculate kg.
4. Use kg to find the mass flux (which is kg multiplied by the concentration difference).

Wait, let me get the parameters right. The diameter is 3 inches, which is 0.25 feet. The velocity is 3.0 ft/s.

So, the gas is air. I need the properties of air at 80°F and 10 atm. Wait, what's the temperature in Kelvin? 80°F is (80-32)*5/9 = about 27°C, 300 K approximately.

At 10 atm, the pressure is higher, so the density and viscosity will be higher than at 1 atm. But I'm not exactly sure of their values. Let me think: for air, at 1 atm and 300 K, the viscosity μ is about 0.0182 cP (centipoise), which is 0.0000182 lb/ft·s. At 10 atm, the viscosity remains roughly the same because viscosity is a function of temperature, not pressure. So μ_gas ≈ 0.0000182 lb/ft·s.

The density of air at 1 atm and 300 K is about 0.076 lb/ft³. But at 10 atm, using the ideal gas law, the density would be 10 times higher, so 0.76 lb/ft³.

Wait, wait, ideal gas law says density ρ = (P M) / (R T), where M is molar mass. Since P increases by 10 times, density also increases 10 times. So yes, ρ = 0.76 lb/ft³.

The diffusivity of CO2 in air: I think it's around 0.16 ft²/hr at 1 atm and 300 K. But wait, at higher pressures, the diffusivity would decrease because D ∝ 1/P. So D_gas = 0.16 / 10 = 0.016 ft²/hr? Wait, is that right? Because at higher pressure, the same number of molecules are present in a smaller volume, so the rate of diffusion would be slower. So yes, D_gas would be lower. So D_gas = 0.16 / 10 = 0.016 ft²/hr.

Wait, but sometimes correlations are in terms of D in cm²/s or m²/s. But I think for this problem, all units are in ft and lb, etc.

Now, let's compute the Reynolds number (Re) for the gas phase. Re = (density * velocity * diameter) / viscosity.

So Re = (0.76 lb/ft³) * (3 ft/s) * (0.25 ft) / (0.0000182 lb/ft·s).

Let me compute that step by step.

Numerator: 0.76 * 3 = 2.28; 2.28 * 0.25 = 0.57.

Denominator: 0.0000182.

So Re = 0.57 / 0.0000182 ≈ 31316. Approximately 3e4.

Wait, 0.57 / 0.0000182 is about 57 / 0.0182 ≈ 3131. Let me compute 0.57 / 0.0000182. 0.0000182 is 1.82e-5. So 0.57 / 1.82e-5 ≈ 57 / 1.82 ≈ 31.32; then 31.32e5? Wait, no, 0.57 divided by 0.0000182 is 0.57 / 0.0000182 = (57e-2) / (1.82e-5) ) = (57/1.82) * (1e3) ≈ 31.32 * 1e3 = 31320. So Re ≈ 31320.

Now, the Schmidt number (Sc) is (μ / (ρ * D_gas)).

So Sc = (0.0000182 lb/ft·s) / (0.76 lb/ft³ * 0.016 ft²/hr).

Wait, let's compute the denominator first: 0.76 * 0.016 = 0.01216 lb/ft³*ft²/hr.

Wait, but units for Sc should be dimensionless. Let me check units.

μ is in lb/ft·s.

ρ is lb/ft³.

D is ft²/hr.

So μ/(ρ * D) → (lb/ft·s) / ( (lb/ft³) * (ft²/hr) ) )

Simplify denominator: (lb * ft²) / (ft³ * hr) ) → (lb) / (ft * hr) )

So overall, units: (lb/ft·s) / ( lb/(ft·hr) ) ) → (1/(ft·s)) * (ft·hr) ) → (hr)/(s) )= 3600, so the units would be s^-1 * something? Hmm, perhaps I messed up the unit analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with the calculation.

Compute denominator: 0.76 * 0.016 = 0.01216 lb/(ft³) * ft²/hr → but wait, the units would be (lb·ft²)/(ft³·hr) = lb/(ft·hr). So μ is lb/(ft·s), so μ/(ρ D) = (lb/(ft·s)) / (lb/(ft·hr)) ) ) → (1/s) * (hr/1) ) → 3600/1, so Sc is unitless and equals 3600 * (μ/(ρ D)).

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the numerical value.

Sc = μ / (ρ * D) → 0.0000182 / (0.76 * 0.016) → 0.0000182 / 0.01216 ≈ 0.001497, approximately 0.0015. Hmm, that seems low. Wait, that can't be right. Because Sc for gases is typically around 1 or higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me double-check the D_gas. I thought it was 0.16 ft²/hr at 1 atm, but at 10 atm, it's 0.016. Wait, that seems correct because diffusivity is inversely proportional to pressure.

But let me check: D is proportional to T^(3/2) and inversely proportional to P. So if T is the same, D would be D0 * P0 / P, where P0 is 1 atm. So yes, 0.16 ft²/hr at 1 atm becomes 0.016 at 10 atm.

Wait, but with that, the Sc is 0.0000182 / (0.76 * 0.016) → 0.0000182 / 0.01216 → approximately 0.001497. That's 0.0015, which is 1.5e-3. That's a very low Sc, but maybe that's correct for gases. Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the diffusivity is higher? Let's think again: at 1 atm, D for CO2 in air is about 0.16 ft²/hr. Wait, no, that seems a bit low. Alternatively, maybe 0.16 cm²/s, which is a different unit. Oh, right, I might have mixed up units.

Wait, in gas systems, the diffusivity is often in cm²/s. For CO2 in air, I think it's around 0.16 cm²/s. But in my earlier calculation, I used ft²/hr, which is a much larger unit. So I must have messed up the unit conversion.

Wait, let me clarify the units. Let's convert D_gas to ft²/hr correctly.

1 cm²/s → (1 cm)^2/(1 s) → 1 cm = 0.01 m = 0.0333 ft. So 1 cm² = (0.0333 ft)^2 ≈ 0.00111 ft². 1 second is 1/3600 hours. So 1 cm²/s = 0.00111 ft² / (1/3600 hr) ) → 0.00111 * 3600 ft²/hr ≈ 4 ft²/hr.

Wait, so 0.16 cm²/s → 0.16 * 4 ft²/hr = 0.64 ft²/hr. But wait, that's at 1 atm. At 10 atm, D would be 0.64 /10 = 0.064 ft²/hr.

Ah, okay, that makes more sense. So D_gas = 0.064 ft²/hr.

So now, let's recalculate Sc.

Sc = μ / (ρ * D_gas).

μ is 0.0000182 lb/(ft·s).

ρ is 0.76 lb/ft³.

D_gas is 0.064 ft²/hr.

So denominator: 0.76 * 0.064 = 0.04864 lb/(ft³) * ft²/hr → 0.04864 lb/(ft·hr).

Wait, units again: μ is lb/(ft·s), denominator is lb/(ft·hr). So:

Sc = (0.0000182 lb/(ft·s)) / (0.04864 lb/(ft·hr)) )

The lb/(ft) units cancel out. s and hr: 1 hr = 3600 s.

So Sc = (0.0000182 / 0.04864) * (3600 s / 1 hr) → (0.0000182 / 0.04864) * 3600.

Calculate numerator: 0.0000182 / 0.04864 ≈ 0.000374.

Multiply by 3600: 0.000374 * 3600 ≈ 1.346.

So Sc ≈ 1.35.

That makes more sense because Sc for gases is usually around 1.

Now, using the Sherwood number correlation for the gas phase in a wetted wall column. I think the correlation is Sh = 0.25 * Re^0.5 * Sc^0.3.

Wait, is that correct? Or perhaps it's Sh = (Re * Sc)^0.5, or another exponent. I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another correlation could be Sh = 0.25 * (Re^0.5) * (Sc)^0.3.

Wait, let me think: for a wetted wall column, the gas flows through a cylindrical tube, and the liquid flows down as a film. The mass transfer occurs from the gas to the liquid (or vice versa). The common correlations for Sh in a wetted wall column for the gas phase might involve Re and Sc.

I've heard that Sh can be expressed as 0.25 * Re^0.5 * Sc^(1/3), but I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, maybe it's Sh = 0.25 * (Re * Sc)^(1/2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the correct correlation. Oh wait, in my notes, I remember that for a wetted wall column, the Sherwood number can be approximated by Sh = 0.25 * Re^0.5 * Sc^0.3.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about the exponents. Let me proceed with that.

So Sh = 0.25 * Re^0.5 * Sc^0.3.

We have Re = 31320, Sc = 1.35.

Compute Re^0.5: sqrt(31320) ≈ 177 (since 177^2=31329, almost exactly).

Sc^0.3: 1.35^0.3 ≈ e^{0.3 * ln(1.35)} → ln(1.35) ≈ 0.3001, so 0.3 * 0.3001 ≈ 0.09003. e^0.09003 ≈ 1.094.

So Sh ≈ 0.25 * 177 * 1.094 ≈ 0.25 * 177 ≈ 44.25; 44.25 * 1.094 ≈ 48.3.

So Sh ≈ 48.3.

Then, kg = Sh * D_gas / diameter.

D_gas is 0.064 ft²/hr.

Diameter is 0.25 ft.

So kg = 48.3 * 0.064 / 0.25.

Compute numerator: 48.3 * 0.064 ≈ 3.0912.

Divide by 0.25: 3.0912 / 0.25 ≈ 12.366 ft/hr.

Wait, that's kg ≈ 12.37 ft/hr? But looking at the options, the kg values are in the 80s to 90s. So this can't be right. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I got the correlation wrong. Maybe the correct correlation is Sh = 0.25 * Re^0.5 * Sc^(1/3). Let me try that.

Sc^(1/3) = (1.35)^(0.333) ≈ 1.10.

So Sh ≈ 0.25 * 177 * 1.10 ≈ 0.25 * 177 = 44.25; 44.25 * 1.1 ≈ 48.68.

So Sh ≈ 48.68.

kg = 48.68 * 0.064 / 0.25 → 48.68 * 0.064 ≈ 3.115; 3.115 / 0.25 ≈ 12.46 ft/hr.

Still too low. But the options are all around 80-90 ft/hr. So I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I got the diameter wrong. The diameter is 3 inches, which is 0.25 ft. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong correlation. Maybe for a wetted wall column, the Sherwood number correlation is different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct correlation for the gas-phase Sherwood number is Sh = 0.009 * Re^0.9 * Sc^0.5. No, that doesn't ring a bell.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the penetration theory, where kg = (D_gas * u) / (π * D * δ), where δ is the thickness of the boundary layer. Hmm, but I don't know δ.

Wait, another approach: in a wetted wall column, the liquid flows as a thin film, and the gas flows in the core. The mass transfer coefficient for the gas can be estimated using the equation kg = 5.56 * (D_gas * u) / (diameter).

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, for a wetted wall column, kg = (D_gas / (diameter)) * (Re)^0.5 * (Sc)^0.3.

Wait, let's try that. So kg = (0.064 ft²/hr / 0.25 ft) ) * Re^0.5 * Sc^0.3.

Wait, Re^0.5 is sqrt(31320
