Question:

What are factors which affect concept attainment and how does each affect the learning of concepts?

Options:

A: The factors are the socioeconomic status of the student, the educational policies in place, and the consistency of teaching styles.
B: The factors include the pacing of the curriculum, the extracurricular activities of the student, and peer influence.
C: The factors which affect concept attainment are the dominance of cues in the stimuli, feedback and reinforcement after performance, and the selection and organization of information.
D: The factors are the student's genetic predispositions, the color of the classroom walls, and the seating arrangements.

Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about factors affecting concept attainment and their impact on learning. Hmm, I need to think through this carefully.

First, the question asks what factors affect concept attainment and how each affects learning. The options are A to D, each listing different factors. I remember from my studies that concept attainment involves how we form concepts through experiences and learning. So, factors that influence this process would relate to the learning environment, teaching methods, and perhaps individual differences.

Looking at option A: socioeconomic status, educational policies, and teaching styles. Socioeconomic status can definitely impact a student's resources and access to education, which might affect concept learning. Educational policies shape curriculum and teaching methods. Consistent teaching styles could influence how well concepts are taught. But wait, are these the most direct factors in concept attainment? I'm not too sure. These seem more like broader educational factors rather than specific to concept learning processes.

Option B: pacing of the curriculum, extracurricular activities, and peer influence. The pacing of the curriculum affects how quickly concepts are introduced. If it's too fast, some students might struggle; too slow, and others might get bored. Extracurricular activities might take time away from studying but can also build skills. Peer influence can affect motivation and engagement. But again, are these the primary factors specifically for concept attainment? They might be more general learning factors.

Option C: dominance of cues in stimuli, feedback and reinforcement, and selection and organization of information. This rings a bell. Dominance of cues refers to how prominent certain features are when learning a concept. If the relevant cues are clear, it's easier to learn. Feedback and reinforcement after performing a task help in confirming whether the concept was understood correctly. Positive reinforcement strengthens the learning. The selection and organization of information are about how the teacher presents the materialâ€”whether it's structured and relevant, which aids in understanding. This seems to directly relate to the process of attaining concepts, as it's about the learning environment and the methods used.

Option D: genetic predispositions, color of walls, seating arrangements. Genetic factors can influence learning abilities, but the color of walls and seating might be environmental factors that affect comfort and focus, but are they directly linked to concept attainment? I'm not certain. These seem more like classroom environment factors rather than specific to how concepts are learned.

So, thinking back, concept attainment is about how concepts are formed. The process involves identifying relevant features (cues), receiving feedback, and how information is presented. So option C lists factors directly tied to these aspects. The other options include broader or less directly related factors.

The factors which affect concept attainment are the dominance of cues in the stimuli, feedback and reinforcement after performance, and the selection and organization of information. These factors directly influence how concepts are formed and learned, as they pertain to the clarity of relevant features, confirmation of understanding through feedback, and the structured presentation of material. 

Answer: C
