Okay, so I've got this problem here about drafts and discounting, and I'm supposed to find out the proceeds. Hmm, let's break it down step by step because I'm a bit rusty on this.

Alright, the draft is dated December 9, and it's drawn by Parker Bros. for $815.50 at 6% and payable 4 months after the date. So, the maturity date would be April 9th of next year, right? Because December has 31 days, so 31 minus 9 is 22 days left in December, then January (31), February (28), March (31), that's 22+31+28+31 = 112 days? Wait no, wait, wait. Wait, 4 months after December 9 would be April 9. Because December to March is 3 months, plus one more month makes April. So from Dec 9 to April 9 is 4 months.

But wait, the draft is discounted at the bank on January 9. So the time between Dec 9 and Jan 9 is one month. So the bank is discounting it before it's due, taking the present value.

The discounting rate is 6 and a half percent, which is 6.5%. Also, there's a charge of 1/8 percent for collecting when it's due. I need to calculate the proceeds that Parker Bros. received when they discounted the draft.

So the formula for the proceeds when discounting a note is:

Proceeds = Face Value - Discount

The discount is calculated as the face value multiplied by the discount rate multiplied by the time in years. 

Wait, but the time here is from January 9 to April 9. Because the bank is discounting it on January 9, so the time until maturity is the period from Jan 9 to April 9. Let me calculate the number of days between those dates.

January has 31 days, so from Jan 9 to Jan 31 is 22 days. Then February 28 days, March 31, and April 9. So 22 (Jan) +28 (Feb)+31 (Mar)+9 (Apr) = 90 days total. Because 22+28 is 50, plus 31 is 81, plus 9 is 90 days.

Wait, but wait: from January 9 to April 9 is exactly 3 months. Because each month is roughly 30 days, so 3 times 30 is 90 days. Yeah, that checks out. So 90 days is a quarter of a year, which is 0.25 years.

So the discount rate is 6.5% per annum, so the discount is face value * rate * time.

Face value is $815.50. Rate is 6.5% or 0.065. Time is 90 days, which is 90/365 = approximately 0.246575 years. Or wait, alternatively, sometimes in banking, they might use 360 days as the year, but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, the problem says 6% payable 4 months after date, but when discounting, the bank's rate is 6.5%. I think it's safer to go with 365 days unless stated otherwise, but sometimes it's 360 for some calculations. But maybe the problem uses 360 days. Let me think.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify, but perhaps it's better to use 360 days because it's a common practice in some financial calculations. Alternatively, maybe it's exact months. Let's see: 4 months is about 121 days (since 30 days a month would be 120, plus 1 more day). But wait, when the draft is 4 months after Dec 9, that would be April 9, as I thought earlier.

But for discounting, the time is 90 days from Jan 9 to April 9. So 90 days is the period.

If I'm using 360 days a year, then 90 days is 0.25 years (since 90/360=0.25). If using 365, it's about 0.246575.

But perhaps the problem expects me to use 360 days. Let's proceed with that for now.

So discount calculation:

Discount = 815.50 * (6.5/100) * (90/360)

Wait, 90/360 is 0.25, so 815.50 * 0.065 * 0.25.

Let me compute that.

First, 815.50 * 0.065. Let's see:

815.50 * 0.06 = 48.93

815.50 * 0.005 = approx 4.0775

So total is 48.93 + 4.0775 = 53.0075

Then multiply by 0.25: 53.0075 * 0.25 = 13.251875

So the discount is approximately $13.25.

So the proceeds from discounting would be Face Value minus discount, which is 815.50 - 13.25 = 802.25.

Wait, but wait a second, there's also a charge of 1/8 percent for collecting when due. Oh, right, so that's an additional charge.

So what's 1/8 percent of the face value? 1/8% is 0.125%, so 815.50 * 0.00125.

Let me calculate that: 815.50 * 0.00125. 815.50 * 0.001 is 0.8155, and 0.00025 is approx 0.203875. So total is 0.8155 + 0.203875 = 1.019375.

So that's approximately $1.02.

So the total charges are discount plus collection charge: 13.25 + 1.02 = 14.27.

Therefore, proceeds = 815.50 - 14.27 = 801.23.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: $809.35

B: $817.2

C: $13.52

D: $792.40

E: $834.67

F: $842.10

G: $815.50

H: $800.00

I: $825.75

J: $831.81

Hmm, $801.23 is not in the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Let me go back and reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the discount. Maybe the rate is applied differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use 365 days for the time factor.

So time is 90 days. 90/365 is approximately 0.246575.

So discount would be 815.50 * 0.065 * (90/365).

Compute 0.065 * (90/365) first.

90/365 is approx 0.246575. 0.065 * 0.246575 ≈ 0.016026875.

Then 815.50 * 0.016026875.

Let me compute that.

815.50 * 0.016 = approx 13.048

815.50 * 0.000026875 ≈ approx 815.50 * 0.000027 ≈ 0.022.

So total discount is approximately 13.048 + 0.022 = 13.07.

Then subtract that from face value: 815.50 - 13.07 = 802.43.

Then subtract the 1/8% charge: 815.50 * 0.00125 = approx 1.02.

So total proceeds: 815.50 - 13.07 - 1.02 = 815.50 -14.09 = 801.41.

Still, none of the options match this. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the time. Let's think again about when the draft is discounted. If the draft is dated Dec 9 and discounted on Jan 9, that's 31 days later (since Dec has 31 days). So the time from Dec 9 to Jan 9 is 31 days. But the draft is payable 4 months after Dec 9, which is April 9. So from the discount date (Jan 9) to maturity (April 9) is 90 days, as before.

Wait, but maybe the discount calculation uses the time from the discount date to the due date. So yes, 90 days.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated using the bank's discounting method, which might be 360 days.

Wait, let me try the 360-day approach again.

Discount: 815.50 * 0.065 * (90/360) = 815.50 * 0.065 * 0.25 = 815.50 * 0.01625.

Calculate 815.50 * 0.01625.

Let me break it down:

815.50 * 0.01 = 8.155

815.50 * 0.006 = 4.893

815.50 * 0.00025 = approx 0.203875

So adding these:

8.155 +4.893 =13.048

13.048 + 0.203875 =13.251875, which is approx $13.25.

So discount is $13.25, as before.

So proceeds after discount: 815.50 - 13.25 = 802.25.

Then subtract the 1/8% collection fee: 815.50 * 0.00125=1.019375, which is about $1.02.

So total proceeds: 802.25 -1.02=801.23.

Hmm. None of the options are near this, except perhaps option A is 809.35, which is higher. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the collection charge is not a separate deduction but part of the discount? Or perhaps the 1/8% is applied to the discounted amount?

Alternatively, perhaps the 1/8% is a flat fee regardless, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the 1/8% is an additional fee, so the total deductions are discount plus the fee.

Wait, but the problem says a charge of 1/8% for collecting when due. So that would be an additional fee, yes.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the discount rate includes all fees, but in this problem, the 6.5% is the discount rate and the 1/8% is an additional charge.

Wait, perhaps the 1/8% is on the face value. So total deductions would be discount plus 1/8% of face value.

So total deduction is (discount) + (collection fee).

So discount is 13.25 (as before), collection fee is 1.02, total deduction 14.27.

Proceeds: 815.50 -14.27=801.23.

No, still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the discount is calculated differently. Maybe it's simple interest applied to the discounted time.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the 6% on the draft is the interest rate, but when discounting, the bank uses their own rate of 6.5%. So perhaps the calculation method is different.

Wait, perhaps the draft's face value includes interest, so when discounted, it's the present value.

Wait, the draft is a time draft, which is like a postdated check. So when discounted, the bank gives the present value of the face amount.

So the present value would be face value divided by (1 + rt), where r is the discount rate and t is time in years.

Wait, that might be another approach.

So using present value formula: PV = FV / (1 + rt)

But wait, the discount is calculated as FV * r * t, so in the previous approach, the proceeds are FV - (FV * r * t) = FV*(1 - r*t).

Alternatively, the present value would be FV / (1 + r*t), but that's when using simple interest.

Wait, but since the discount is calculated as simple interest, the two approaches are equivalent.

Hmm, perhaps I should try using the present value approach.

So PV = 815.50 / (1 + (0.065 * (90/360)))

So 90/360=0.25. 0.065*0.25=0.01625.

So denominator is 1.01625.

So PV = 815.50 / 1.01625.

Let me compute that.

Divide 815.50 by 1.01625.

Let me see: 1.01625 * 800 = approx 813.

So 800 * 1.01625 = 813.

So 800 gives 813, which is less than 815.50.

Wait, maybe 802 * 1.01625?

Let's compute 800 *1.01625=813.

2 *1.01625=2.0325.

So 802 *1.01625= 813 +2.0325=815.0325.

Which is very close to 815.50.

So 802 *1.01625≈815.0325.

So 815.50 /1.01625 ≈ approx 802.05.

So the present value is approximately $802.05.

Then, subtract the 1/8% collection fee.

So 1/8% of 815.50 is 815.50 *0.00125=1.019375≈$1.02.

So proceeds would be 802.05 -1.02≈800.03.

Hmm, that's about $800, which is option H.

But wait, earlier I thought the proceeds were around $801.23, but this approach gives about $800.03.

Wait, but perhaps the collection fee is applied after the discount. Or maybe the collection fee is included in the calculation as part of the discount. Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is a flat fee, not based on the face value.

Wait, the problem states: "A charge of (1/8)% for collecting it when due was also charged."

So the charge is 1/8%, which is 0.125%, so that's a fee of 815.50 * 0.00125= approx $1.02.

So the proceeds after discount and fee would be 815.50 - discount - fee.

Which in the present value method, the discount is 13.25, fee is 1.02, so proceeds are 801.23.

Hmm, but that doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option A is 809.35, which is higher than the face value. That can't be right, because when you discount, you get less than face value. So A is higher, which suggests it's an error. Or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong time period. Let's recalculate the number of days between Jan 9 and April 9.

Jan 9 to April 9: January has 31 days, so from Jan 9 to Jan 31 is 22 days. Then February (28), March (31), and April 9 is 9 days. So 22+28=50, +31=81, +9=90 days. So that's correct.

Wait, what if the discount is calculated using 360 days?

So 90/360=0.25.

So discount is 815.50 * 0.065 * 0.25=13.251875.

Proceeds after discount: 815.50 -13.251875=802.248125.

Then subtract the collection fee of (1/8)%: 815.50 *0.00125=1.019375.

So total proceeds: 802.248125 -1.019375=801.22875, which is approximately $801.23.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is applied to the proceeds after discount, not to the face value. So instead of subtracting 1.02 from the face value, it's subtracted from the discounted amount.

Wait, let me try that.

After discount, proceeds are 815.50 -13.251875=802.248125.

Then, subtract 1/8% of 802.248125, which is 802.248125 *0.00125≈1.0028.

So total proceeds: 802.248125 -1.0028≈801.245.

Still around $801.25, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the charge. Maybe the 1/8% is on the discounted amount, not the face value. But that would make the fee smaller, but still not matching the options.

Alternatively, maybe the problem doesn't deduct the collection fee from the proceeds but adds it as an expense. But that wouldn't make sense because the bank would deduct their fees.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1/8% is an annual rate, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 6% in the draft is the interest rate, but the discounting is done at 6.5%. So maybe the interest is calculated on the draft for 4 months, but when discounted, the bank takes their rate.

Wait, perhaps the proceeds are calculated by subtracting the interest that would accrue from the date of discounting to the due date, plus the collection fee.

So the draft is for 4 months, so the interest on the draft is 6% per annum, so for 4 months, it's 6%*(4/12)=2%.

So the interest is 815.50 * 0.02= $16.31.

So the net amount after interest would be 815.50 -16.31=799.19.

Wait, but that's not considering the discounting at 6.5%.

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up concepts here.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6% is the interest rate for the draft, and the discounting is done at 6.5%, so the proceeds are calculated as the present value minus the draft's interest, but that seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I need to approach this using the concept of bank discount and present value.

The bank discount is calculated as the face value multiplied by the discount rate multiplied by the time.

So BD = FV * r * t.

Then, the present value (proceeds) is FV - BD.

In this case, BD =815.50 *6.5% * (90/360) =?

So 6.5% is 0.065, 90/360 is 0.25.

So BD=815.50 *0.065*0.25=13.251875.

Proceeds after discount: 815.50 -13.251875=802.248125.

Then, subtract the collection fee of 1/8% of FV, which is 1.019375.

So total proceeds: 802.248125 -1.019375=801.22875≈801
