Okay, so I need to find the value of a > 0 where the tangent line to the function f(x) = x² e^(-x) at x = a passes through the origin. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the equation of a tangent line to a function at a point x = a is given by y = f(a) + f’(a)(x - a). Since the tangent passes through the origin (0,0), plugging x=0 and y=0 into this equation should satisfy it. So, 0 = f(a) + f’(a)(0 - a), which simplifies to 0 = f(a) - a f’(a). That gives me the equation f(a) = a f’(a).

Now, I need to compute f(a) and f’(a). The function is f(x) = x² e^(-x). To find f’(x), I'll have to use the product rule. The product rule says that if you have u(x) = x² and v(x) = e^(-x), then f’(x) = u’(x)v(x) + u(x)v’(x).

Calculating u’(x) is straightforward: u’(x) = 2x. For v’(x), the derivative of e^(-x) is -e^(-x). So putting it together, f’(x) = 2x e^(-x) + x² (-e^(-x)) = (2x - x²) e^(-x).

So f(a) = a² e^(-a) and f’(a) = (2a - a²) e^(-a). Plugging these into the equation f(a) = a f’(a):

a² e^(-a) = a * (2a - a²) e^(-a).

Hmm, I can factor out e^(-a) from both sides since e^(-a) is never zero. That leaves me with a² = a (2a - a²).

Let me simplify the right side: a*(2a - a²) = 2a² - a³.

So now the equation is a² = 2a² - a³. Let's bring all terms to one side: a² - 2a² + a³ = 0 → -a² + a³ = 0 → a³ - a² = 0.

Factor out a²: a² (a - 1) = 0. So the solutions are a²=0 → a=0, or a-1=0 → a=1. But the question specifies a > 0, so a=0 is not valid. Hence, a=1 is the solution.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me plug a=1 back into the original condition to see if it works.

Compute f(1) = (1)^2 e^(-1) = e^(-1) ≈ 0.3679.

Compute f’(1) = (2*1 - 1^2) e^(-1) = (2 -1) e^(-1) = e^(-1) ≈ 0.3679.

Then, the tangent line equation at x=1 is y = f(1) + f’(1)(x - 1). Plugging x=0, y should be 0.

So y = e^(-1) + e^(-1)(0 -1) = e^(-1) - e^(-1) = 0. That works! So a=1 is indeed the correct answer.

Looking at the options, option E is 1. So the answer should be E.

To find the value of \( a > 0 \) such that the tangent line to the graph of \( f(x) = x^2 e^{-x} \) at \( x = a \) passes through the origin, we start by determining the equation of the tangent line. The tangent line at \( x = a \) is given by:

\[
y = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a).
\]

Since the tangent passes through the origin \((0,0)\), substituting \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \) into the equation gives:

\[
0 = f(a) - a f'(a).
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
f(a) = a f'(a).
\]

Next, we compute \( f(a) \) and \( f'(a) \). The function is \( f(x) = x^2 e^{-x} \). Using the product rule, the derivative is:

\[
f'(x) = 2x e^{-x} + x^2 (-e^{-x}) = (2x - x^2) e^{-x}.
\]

Thus, \( f(a) = a^2 e^{-a} \) and \( f'(a) = (2a - a^2) e^{-a} \). Substituting these into \( f(a) = a f'(a) \), we get:

\[
a^2 e^{-a} = a (2a - a^2) e^{-a}.
\]

Factoring out \( e^{-a} \) (which is never zero), the equation simplifies to:

\[
a^2 = a (2a - a^2).
\]

Expanding and rearranging terms:

\[
a^2 = 2a^2 - a^3 \quad \implies \quad a^3 - a^2 = 0.
\]

Factoring out \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 (a - 1) = 0.
\]

This gives the solutions \( a = 0 \) or \( a = 1 \). Since \( a > 0 \), we discard \( a = 0 \), leaving \( a = 1 \).

To verify, we check that the tangent line at \( a = 1 \) passes through the origin. Substituting \( a = 1 \) into \( f(a) \) and \( f'(a) \):

\[
f(1) = 1^2 e^{-1} = e^{-1}, \quad f'(1) = (2(1) - 1^2) e^{-1} = e^{-1}.
\]

The tangent line equation is:

\[
y = e^{-1} + e^{-1}(x - 1).
\]

At \( x = 0 \):

\[
y = e^{-1} + e^{-1}(0 - 1) = e^{-1} - e^{-1} = 0.
\]

This confirms that the tangent line passes through the origin when \( a = 1 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: 1**
