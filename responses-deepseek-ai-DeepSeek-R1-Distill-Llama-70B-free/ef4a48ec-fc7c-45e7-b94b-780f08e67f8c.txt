Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 0.3 multiplied by 427. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that multiplying decimals can sometimes be tricky, but there must be a straightforward way to do it.

Wait, 0.3 is the same as 3 tenths, right? So maybe I can think of this as 427 multiplied by 3 and then divided by 10. That might make it easier. Let me try that.

First, I'll multiply 427 by 3. Let's see, 400 times 3 is 1200, and 27 times 3 is 81. So adding those together, 1200 plus 81 equals 1281. Okay, so 427 times 3 is 1281. Now, since I want 427 times 0.3, which is 3/10, I need to divide this result by 10. 

Dividing 1281 by 10 is simple; I just move the decimal point one place to the left. So 1281 becomes 128.1. Got it. So 0.3 times 427 is 128.1.

Let me double-check that. Another way to think about it is that 0.3 is 30%, so 30% of 427. To find 10%, I can divide 427 by 10, which is 42.7. Then, 30% is three times that, so 42.7 times 3. Let's calculate that: 40 times 3 is 120, and 2.7 times 3 is 8.1. Adding them gives 120 + 8.1 = 128.1. Yep, same result. That makes me confident the answer is correct.

Looking at the options, option A is 128.1, which matches my calculation. So the correct answer should be A.
