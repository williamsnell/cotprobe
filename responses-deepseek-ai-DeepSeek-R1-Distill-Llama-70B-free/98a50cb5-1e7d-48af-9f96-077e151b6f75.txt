Okay, so I've got this question about population pyramids and their shapes based on birth and death rates. Hmm, population pyramids are those bar graphs that show the distribution of a population across different age groups, right? They usually have three shapes: expanding, stable, or contracting.

The question says the population has had a slightly larger birth rate than death rate for several generations. Wait, so more people are being born than dying. That probably means the population is growing. In terms of the pyramid, I remember that when there are more births, the base of the pyramid gets wider because there are more young people.

So let me think about what each shape implies. An expanding population, which is growing, typically has a broad base and tapers upwards. That's because each age cohort is larger than the one before it. So the pyramid looks kind of like a triangle from the bottom, getting narrower as you go up.

Looking at the options, I need to pick which shape corresponds to this. Option A says narrow at the bottom and wide at the top. No, that doesn't make sense because a growing population should have a wide base, not narrow. Option B is parallel sides, which I think would be a stable population where each age group is similar in size. So that's probably not it.

Option C is diamond-shaped. I'm not too sure about that. Maybe that's a different scenario, like a population with a lot of middle-aged people. Option D has even width, so that's the same as B, maybe a stable population. Option E is bulging at the top. That's probably a population with a high proportion of older people, maybe a declining population.

Option F is bulging in the middle. That might indicate a lot of people in the middle age groups, perhaps a stable or a different kind of population structure. Option G is wider at the top than in the middle. That seems a bit strange; I'm not sure which scenario that fits. Option H is wider at the bottom than at the top. Oh wait, that's what I was thinking earlierâ€”so the base is wide because of more births. So H could be the answer.

Option I is narrow at the top and wide in the middle. That might suggest a lot of middle-aged individuals, but I'm not sure. Option J is narrow in the middle and wide at top and bottom. That seems unusual, maybe a population with a lot of young and old but not many middle-aged, but I don't think that's the case here.

So putting it together: a slightly higher birth rate than death rate leads to more young people, so the pyramid is wider at the bottom. So the correct answer should be H: Wider at the bottom than at the top.

The population pyramid of a population with a slightly larger birth rate than death rate for several generations will typically have a broad base and taper upwards. This is because a higher birth rate results in more young individuals, making the base wider. Among the given options, the shape that matches this description is "wider at the bottom than at the top."

Answer: H
