Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about vapor pressure. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is asking for the vapor pressure of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) at 38°C. They've given me some data: the enthalpy of vaporization H is 32,000 J/mol, and at 23°C, the vapor pressure is 0.132 atm. Oh right, I remember that vapor pressure depends on temperature, so I probably need to use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation here.

Wait, what's the Clausius-Clapeyron equation again? I think it's ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH_vap / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2). Yeah, something like that. So P is pressure, T is temperature in Kelvin, R is the gas constant, and ΔH is the enthalpy of vaporization.

First, I need to convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin because the equation requires absolute temperature. For T1, which is 23°C, adding 273.15 gives me 296.15 K. T2 is 38°C, so that's 311.15 K.

So plugging in the known values: P1 is 0.132 atm, T1 is 296.15 K, T2 is 311.15 K, ΔH is 32,000 J/mol, and R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). Wait, wait, I should make sure the units match. Oh right, since ΔH is in J, R is 8.314, so that's okay.

Let me write the equation again with the numbers:

ln(P2/0.132) = (32000 / 8.314) * (1/296.15 - 1/311.15)

Calculating the denominator first: 1/296.15 is approximately 0.003378, and 1/311.15 is about 0.003215. So subtracting them gives 0.003378 - 0.003215 = 0.000163.

Now, 32000 divided by 8.314 is about 32000 /8 ≈4000, but let me calculate it accurately. 32000 /8.314 = approximately 3848.5.

So multiply that by the difference (0.000163): 3848.5 * 0.000163 ≈ ?

Let me compute 3848.5 * 0.0001 = 0.38485, and 3848.5 * 0.000063 = let's see, 3848.5 *6e-5 = 0.23091. Adding them together gives 0.38485 + 0.23091 = 0.61576. Wait, wait, no, that can't be right because 0.000163 is 1.63e-4. So maybe a better way is 3848.5 * 1.63e-4.

3848.5 * 1.63e-4 = Let's compute 3848.5 * 1.63 = 3848.5 *1 is 3848.5, 3848.5 *0.6 is 2309.1, 3848.5 *0.03 is 115.455. So adding those: 3848.5 +2309.1=6157.6; 6157.6 +115.455=6273.055. Now multiply by 1e-4: 6273.055e-4 = 0.6273055.

So ln(P2/0.132) ≈ 0.6273.

Now, to solve for P2: take the exponential of both sides. So P2/0.132 = e^0.6273.

What's e^0.6273? I remember that e^0.6 is about 1.822, and e^0.63 is approximately 1.88. Let me compute it more accurately. Let's see, 0.6273 is about 0.63.

Alternatively, maybe using a calculator approach. Let me think: e^0.6 = 1.8221, e^0.02 = 1.0202, e^0.0073 ≈ 1.0073.

So e^0.6273 = e^0.6 * e^0.02 * e^0.0073. So 1.8221 *1.0202 = approx 1.8596, then times 1.0073 gives 1.8596 *1.0073 ≈ 1.874.

So P2 = 0.132 atm * 1.874 ≈ 0.247 atm.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.250 atm. That's really close. So I'd say H is the answer.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of (1/T1 - 1/T2). T1 is 296.15 K, T2 is 311.15 K.

1/296.15 ≈ 0.003378, 1/311.15≈0.003215. Difference is 0.000163. Okay, that seems right.

32000 /8.314. Let me compute that precisely. 8.314 * 3848 = ?

Compute 8 * 3848 = 30784, 0.314 *3848 = let's see, 3848 *0.3= 1154.4, 3848*0.014=53.872. So 1154.4 +53.872=1208.272. So total is 30784 +1208.272= 31992.272. Hmm, that's very close to 32000. So 3848 gives 31992.27, so 3848 is 32000/8.314≈3848.5? So that's correct.

So 3848.5 * 0.000163 = let me compute 3848.5 *0.0001 = 0.38485, 3848.5 *0.000063 = ?

0.000063 is 6.3e-5. So 3848.5 *6.3e-5 = (3848.5 *63)/1e6. 3848.5 *63: let's compute 3800*63=239,400, 48.5*63≈3055.5. So total is 239400 +3055.5= 242,455.5. So divided by 1e6: 242455.5e-6 = 0.242455. So 0.38485 +0.242455= 0.627305.

So yes, that part is correct.

Then, ln(P2/0.132) = 0.6273. So exponentiate both sides. e^0.6273.

Alternatively, using a calculator, e^0.6273 is approximately 1.872. So P2 = 0.132 * 1.872 ≈ 0.247 atm, which is about 0.25 atm, so option H.

Wait, but another approach: sometimes the Antoine equation is used, which is a different form. But in this problem, the data given is two points, so the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is the right approach.

Yes, so I think the correct answer is H: 0.250 atm.

To determine the vapor pressure of CCl₄ at 38°C, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin
- \( T_1 = 23^\circ\text{C} + 273.15 = 296.15 \, \text{K} \)
- \( T_2 = 38^\circ\text{C} + 273.15 = 311.15 \, \text{K} \)

### Step 2: Plug in known values
- \( P_1 = 0.132 \, \text{atm} \)
- \( \Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 32,000 \, \text{J/mol} \)
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \)

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{0.132}\right) = \frac{32,000}{8.314} \left(\frac{1}{296.15} - \frac{1}{311.15}\right)
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \)
- \( \frac{1}{296.15} \approx 0.003378 \, \text{K}^{-1} \)
- \( \frac{1}{311.15} \approx 0.003215 \, \text{K}^{-1} \)
- \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = 0.003378 - 0.003215 = 0.000163 \, \text{K}^{-1} \)

### Step 4: Calculate \( \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \)
\[
\frac{32,000}{8.314} \approx 3848.5
\]

### Step 5: Multiply and solve for \( \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{0.132}\right) \)
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{0.132}\right) = 3848.5 \times 0.000163 \approx 0.6273
\]

### Step 6: Exponentiate to solve for \( P_2 \)
\[
\frac{P_2}{0.132} = e^{0.6273} \approx 1.872
\]
\[
P_2 = 0.132 \times 1.872 \approx 0.247 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Final Answer
The vapor pressure of CCl₄ at 38°C is approximately \( 0.250 \, \text{atm} \), which corresponds to option **H**.
