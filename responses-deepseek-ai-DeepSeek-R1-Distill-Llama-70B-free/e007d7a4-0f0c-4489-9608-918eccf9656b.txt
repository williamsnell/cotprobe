Okay, so I've got this question about amino acids and which one becomes essential under stress. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my biochemistry, but I'll try to think this through.

The question is asking about amino acids that are usually dispensable, meaning the body can make them, but under stress conditions, like metabolic or other stress, they might be needed in larger amounts than the body can produce. So, in such cases, the body can't keep up, and they become essential to obtain from the diet.

I remember that amino acids are categorized as essential or non-essential. Essential ones can't be made by the body, so we have to get them from food. Non-essential can be synthesized. But wait, the question is about which non-essential (dispensable) amino acid becomes required in higher amounts during stress.

Let me think about each option:

A: Glutamate – I think this is a non-essential amino acid. It's a neurotransmitter and plays a role in metabolism. But is it required more under stress?

B: Tyrosine – Oh, right, tyrosine is conditionally essential. It's usually made from phenylalanine, which is essential. So under conditions where phenylalanine is limited, tyrosine becomes essential. But the question is about stress, not phenylalanine availability.

C: Alanine – It's non-essential. It's involved in glucose production via gluconeogenesis. I'm not sure if it's required more under stress.

D: Glutamine – Oh yeah, I remember this one. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body. Under stress, like intense exercise, burns, or illness, the body's demand for glutamine increases. It's used by the immune system and for gut health. Normally, it's non-essential because the body makes it, but in times of stress, the need may outstrip production, making it conditionally essential.

E: Arginine – Another conditionally essential amino acid. Important for nitric oxide production. I think in certain conditions, like infancy or severe stress, it becomes essential. But is it the one that's dispensable but needed more under stress?

F: Glycine – Non-essential, involved in collagen and proteins. Not sure about stress needs.

G: Proline – Also non-essential, made from glutamate. Important for collagen. I don't recall it being conditionally essential.

H: Cysteine – Usually considered non-essential because it's synthesized from methionine, which is essential. But in some cases, like when methionine is limited, cysteine might be needed. But again, the question is about stress.

I: Aspartate – Non-essential, involved in the citric acid cycle. Not sure about its role in stress.

J: Serine – Another non-essential, important for various metabolic processes. Maybe required in larger amounts during stress?

So, back to the options. The key here is that during stress, the body's synthesis might not meet the demand. Glutamine comes to mind because I've heard that in catabolic states, like sepsis or burns, the body can't make enough glutamine, so supplementation is often needed. So glutamine becomes essential in those situations.

Wait, arginine is also semi-essential. In infancy, it's essential, but in adults, usually not. But under certain stresses, maybe it's needed more. But I'm more confident about glutamine being the answer here.

So looking at the options, D is glutamine. That must be the correct answer.

Under conditions of metabolic or other stress, the body may require certain amino acids in greater amounts than it can synthesize, even if they are typically considered dispensable. Among the options provided, glutamine stands out as the correct answer. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body and plays a critical role in immune function, gut health, and energy metabolism. During stress, such as intense exercise, burns, or illness, the body's demand for glutamine increases significantly, and its synthesis may not meet these elevated needs. This makes glutamine conditionally essential under such conditions. 

Other options, such as tyrosine, arginine, and cysteine, are either conditionally essential under specific circumstances or not primarily associated with stress-related increased demand. Therefore, glutamine is the most appropriate choice.

Answer: D
