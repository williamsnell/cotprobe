Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question: "At what age can someone first attend an R-rated movie without an accompanying adult?" The options are A through J, with various ages listed.

Hmm, I remember that movie ratings in the US are regulated by the Motion Picture Association (MPA), right? And the ratings are like G, PG, PG-13, R, and NC-17. R-rated movies typically have more mature themes, language, or content that's not suitable for young children.

Wait, so what's the rule for R-rated movies? I think that if a movie is R-rated, you have to be a certain age to see it without an adult. I remember that for PG-13, you just need to be accompanied by someone, maybe over a certain age, but R is more strict.

I'm pretty sure the age is 17. Because I've heard that some places let 17-year-olds see R-rated movies alone, but others might require being 18. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Or was it that some theaters have their own policies, but the MPAA guidelines say something else?

Let me think. The MPAA guidelines state that children under 17 must be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian to attend an R-rated movie. So that would mean that once you turn 17, you can go without an adult. But wait, is it 17 or 18? Because 18 is the age of majority in many places. Maybe some theaters enforce 18 instead of 17 because it's easier? Or is the MPAA guideline exactly 17?

I think it's 17. Because I've heard that when you're 17, you can buy tickets to R-rated movies without an adult. So the answer should be E: 17.

Wait, but I should double-check. I might be mixing it up with the NC-17 rating, which I believe requires you to be 18 or older, no exceptions. So for R-rated, it's 17 and up can go alone. So the correct answer would be E: 17.

The correct answer is E: 17. According to MPAA guidelines, individuals must be at least 17 years old to attend an R-rated movie without an accompanying adult.
