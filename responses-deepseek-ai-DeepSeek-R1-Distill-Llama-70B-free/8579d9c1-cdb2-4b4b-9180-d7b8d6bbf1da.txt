Okay, so I've got this calculus problem to solve. The function is h(x) = 1/(√x + 1), and I need to find the second derivative h''(x) when x equals 1. Hmm, I remember that finding the second derivative involves taking the derivative twice. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll start by finding the first derivative h'(x). The function h(x) is a quotient, so I might need the quotient rule, but maybe it's easier to rewrite it in a different form. Let me think. Alternatively, I can use the chain rule because the denominator has √x plus 1. 

So, h(x) can be written as (sqrt(x) + 1)^(-1). That might make taking the derivative easier. Using the power rule and chain rule, the derivative of u^n is n*u^(n-1)*u', right?

Applying that here, the first derivative h'(x) would be -1*(sqrt(x) + 1)^(-2) * (derivative of sqrt(x) + 1). The derivative of sqrt(x) is (1/(2√x)) and the derivative of 1 is zero. So putting it together:

h'(x) = -1*( (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) ) * (1/(2√x)) )

Simplify that, h'(x) = -1/(2√x (sqrt(x)+1)^2 )

Wait, let me check the signs. The chain rule gives a negative because of the exponent -1, and then the derivative of the inside is positive 1/(2√x), so yeah, the negative stays.

Now, I need to find the second derivative h''(x). So I'll have to differentiate h'(x). Let me write h'(x) as:

h'(x) = - [1] / [2√x (sqrt(x)+1)^2 ]

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it before taking the derivative. Alternatively, let's consider h'(x) as a product. Let me think: the denominator is 2√x times (sqrt(x)+1)^2. So, h'(x) = -1/(2√x) * 1/(sqrt(x)+1)^2.

Wait, maybe I can combine these terms into a single denominator. Alternatively, I can express this as a product of two functions. Let's say u = 1/(2√x) and v = 1/(sqrt(x)+1)^2. Then h'(x) = - u*v. So to find h''(x), I need to take the derivative of -u*v, which is - (u'v + uv').

But perhaps it's easier to use the quotient rule again. Let me try that approach.

Expressing h'(x) as a single fraction: numerator is -1, denominator is 2√x (sqrt(x)+1)^2. So, it's easier to write h'(x) as (-1) * [2√x (sqrt(x)+1)^2 ]^(-1).

Wait, but maybe taking the derivative using the product and quotient rules might get messy. Maybe I can use the chain rule again by expressing h'(x) in terms that are easier to differentiate.

Alternatively, perhaps I'll rewrite h'(x) as:

h'(x) = - (sqrt(x)+1)^(-2) * (2√x)^(-1)

But I'm not sure if that helps. Let me think about the differentiation. Maybe using the product rule on the terms 1/(2√x) and 1/(sqrt(x)+1)^2.

Wait, let me write h'(x) as:

h'(x) = (-1/2) * x^(-1/2) * (sqrt(x) + 1)^(-2)

So, h'(x) = (-1/2) * x^(-1/2) * (x^(1/2) +1)^(-2)

Now, to find h''(x), I'll need to take the derivative of this expression. Since it's a product of two functions, I'll apply the product rule. Let me set u = x^(-1/2) and v = (x^(1/2)+1)^(-2). Then, h'(x) = (-1/2) * u * v.

So, the derivative of h'(x) is (-1/2) [ u' v + u v' ].

Let me compute u' and v' separately.

First, u = x^(-1/2), so u' = (-1/2) x^(-3/2).

Second, v = (x^(1/2) + 1)^(-2). So v' would be -2*(x^(1/2)+1)^(-3) * (1/(2 x^(1/2)) ), using the chain rule.

Wait, let me compute v' again. The derivative of v with respect to x is:

v = (x^(1/2) +1)^(-2)
So dv/dx = (-2)(x^(1/2)+1)^(-3) * (d/dx)(x^(1/2)+1)
The derivative of x^(1/2) is (1/2)x^(-1/2), and the derivative of 1 is 0. So,

dv/dx = (-2)(x^(1/2)+1)^(-3) * (1/(2 x^(1/2)) )
Simplify that:

The 2 and 1/2 cancel each other, so:

dv/dx = - (x^(1/2)+1)^(-3) * (1/x^(1/2)) )

So now, putting it all together:

h''(x) = (-1/2) [ u' v + u v' ]

Compute each term:

u' v = [ (-1/2) x^(-3/2) ] * [ (x^(1/2)+1)^(-2) ]

u v' = [ x^(-1/2) ] * [ - (x^(1/2)+1)^(-3) * (1/x^(1/2)) ) ]

Wait, wait, let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute u':

u = x^(-1/2)
u' = (-1/2) x^(-3/2)

So, u' v = (-1/2) x^(-3/2) * (x^(1/2) + 1)^(-2)

Now, u v' = x^(-1/2) * [ - (x^(1/2)+1)^(-3) * (1/x^(1/2)) ) ]

Wait, let me clarify that expression. The v' is - (x^(1/2)+1)^(-3) * (1/x^(1/2)), so when I multiply by u, which is x^(-1/2), I get:

u * v' = x^(-1/2) * [ - (x^(1/2)+1)^(-3) * x^(-1/2) ) ]

So, that becomes:

- x^(-1/2) * x^(-1/2) * (x^(1/2)+1)^(-3)

Which is:

- x^(-1) * (x^(1/2) +1)^(-3 )

So, putting it all together:

h''(x) = (-1/2) [ (u' v) + (u v') ]

So substituting in:

h''(x) = (-1/2) [ (-1/2 x^(-3/2) (x^(1/2)+1)^(-2) ) + ( - x^(-1) (x^(1/2)+1)^(-3) ) ) ]

Wait, but let me double-check the signs. The u v' term is negative because v' has a negative sign. So when I substitute, it's:

h''(x) = (-1/2) [ [ (-1/2 x^{-3/2}) (x^{1/2}+1)^{-2} ] + [ x^{-1/2} * (- (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} * x^{-1/2}) ) ] ]

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs earlier. Let me recalculate the u v' term.

v' is - (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} * (1/x^{1/2} )

So when u is x^{-1/2}, u v' becomes x^{-1/2} * [ - (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} * x^{-1/2} ]

So that's:

- x^{-1/2} * x^{-1/2} * (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} )

Which is:

- x^{-1} * (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3}

So back to h''(x):

h''(x) = (-1/2) [ ( (-1/2) x^{-3/2} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-2} ) + ( -x^{-1} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} ) ) ]

Wait, no, the second term is negative, so the entire expression becomes:

[ (-1/2 x^{-3/2} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-2}) ) + ( -x^{-1} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} ) ]

So, it's (-1/2) multiplied by [ term1 + term2 ]

Let me compute this step by step.

First, let's write each term:

term1: (-1/2) x^{-3/2} (x^{1/2} +1)^{-2}

term2: - x^{-1} (x^{1/2} +1)^{-3}

So, h''(x) = (-1/2) [ term1 + term2 ]

Wait, but that would be:

= (-1/2) [ (-1/2) x^{-3/2} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-2} - x^{-1} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} } ]

Hmm, that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor out some terms to simplify.

Let me factor out x^{-3/2} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} from both terms. Wait, let's see.

Looking at term1 and term2:

term1: (-1/2) x^{-3/2} (x^{1/2} +1)^{-2} = (-1/2) x^{-3/2} (x^{1/2} +1)^{-2} * (x^{1/2}+1)/(x^{1/2}+1) ) 

Wait, that might not help. Alternatively, let me write both terms with the same denominator.

Note that (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} can be written as (x^{1/2}+1)^{-2} * (x^{1/2}+1)^{-1}.

Similarly, x^{-3/2} can be written as x^{-1} * x^{-1/2}.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to combine the two terms by finding a common denominator.

Let me compute term1 and term2:

term1 = (-1/2) x^{-3/2} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-2}

term2 = - x^{-1} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3}

Let me factor out (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} x^{-3/2} } from both terms.

Wait, let's see:

term1: (-1/2) x^{-3/2} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-2} = (-1/2) x^{-3/2} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-2} * (x^{1/2}+1) / (x^{1/2}+1) )

So that becomes (-1/2) x^{-3/2} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} (x^{1/2}+1) )

Similarly, term2 is -x^{-1} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} = -x^{-1} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} * x^{-1/2} / x^{-1/2} )

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe a better approach is to factor out (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} x^{-3/2} from both terms.

Let me factor out (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} x^{-3/2}:

term1: (-1/2) x^{-3/2} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-2} = (-1/2) * (x^{1/2}+1)^{-2} * x^{-3/2} = (-1/2) * (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} * (x^{1/2}+1) * x^{-3/2}

So,

term1 = (-1/2) (x^{1/2}+1) * x^{-3/2} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3}

Similarly, term2 is -x^{-1} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} = -x^{-1} (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} * x^{-1/2} * x^{1/2}

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too tangled. Let me try plugging in x=1 right away, maybe that would simplify things.

Because, ultimately, we just need h''(1). So let's compute each part at x=1.

First, compute h'(x) at x=1, then find h''(x) at x=1.

Wait, no, because h''(x) is the derivative of h'(x), so perhaps it's easier to compute h''(x) in terms of x, then plug x=1.

Alternatively, let's compute each term at x=1.

Wait, let's compute the terms step by step.

First, x=1, so sqrt(1) =1.

Compute u and u' at x=1:

u = x^{-1/2} = 1^{-1/2} = 1

u' = (-1/2) x^{-3/2} = (-1/2) * 1^{-3/2} = (-1/2)*1 = -1/2

v = (x^{1/2}+1)^{-2} = (1 +1)^-2 = (2)^-2 = 1/4

v' = - (x^{1/2}+1)^{-3} * x^{-1/2} = -(2)^-3 * 1^{-1/2} = - (1/8) * 1 = -1/8

Now, h''(x) is (-1/2) [ u' v + u v' ]

Substituting the values at x=1:

u' v = (-1/2) * (1/4) = (-1/2) * 1/4 = -1/8

u v' = (1) * (-1/8) = -1/8

So, u' v + u v' = (-1/8) + (-1/8) )= -2/8 = -1/4

Then, h''(x) = (-1/2) * (-1/4) = (1/2) * (1/4) ) = 1/8? Wait, wait, no:

Wait, (-1/2) multiplied by (-1/4) is positive (1/8).

Wait, but wait, let me recalculate:

u' v is (-1/2) * (1/4) = -1/8

u v' is (1) * (-1/8) = -1/8

So sum is (-1/8) + (-1/8) )= -2/8 = -1/4

Then, h''(x) = (-1/2) * (-1/4) ) = (1/2) * (1/4) ) = 1/8 ?

Wait, no:

Wait, it's (-1/2) multiplied by (-1/4), which is positive (1/8).

Wait, but that can't be right because when I compute h'(x) at x=1, I should get a negative value, and h''(x) would be another derivative. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

At x=1:

u = x^{-1/2} =1

u' = (-1/2) x^{-3/2} = (-1/2) *1 = -1/2

v = (1 +1)^-2 = 4^(-1) = 1/4

v' = - (1+1)^-3 * (1/(sqrt(1))) = - (8^-1) * 1 = -1/8

So, u' v is (-1/2) * (1/4) = -1/8

u v' is (1) * (-1/8) = -1/8

Sum is (-1/8) + (-1/8) = -2/8 = -1/4

Then, h''(x) = (-1/2) * (-1/4) = 1/8.

Wait, but this would make h''(1) = 1/8. But looking at the options, 1/8 is 0.125, which is option G. But I'm not sure if I did everything correctly.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the setup. Because when I took the derivative of h'(x), I used the product rule correctly, but perhaps I missed a negative sign.

Wait, let me retrace the steps.

Wait, h'(x) is (-1/2) times u*v, where u = x^{-1/2} and v = (x^{1/2} +1)^{-2}.

Then, the derivative of h'(x) is (-1/2) [ u'v + uv' ]

Yes, that's correct.

At x=1, u=1, u'=-1/2, v=1/4, v'=-1/8.

So, u'v = (-1/2)(1/4) = -1/8

uv' = (1)(-1/8) = -
