Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about logical fallacies. Hmm, I remember that logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that can undermine the logic of an argument. The question is asking which fallacy occurs when someone attributes the cause of an event to a simple cause when it's actually more complicated.

Let me think. The options are A through J, each representing a different fallacy. I need to figure out which one fits this description.

The question is about misattributing a complex cause to a simple one. So, the fallacy would involve oversimplifying the cause of an event. I remember a few fallacies related to causation. There's "post hoc ergo propter hoc," which is when someone assumes that because B follows A, A must cause B. But that's more about confusing sequence with causation, not necessarily about oversimplifying.

Another one is the "slippery slope," which is when someone argues that a small action will lead to a series of related events culminating in some significant effect, much like a snowball effect. But that's more about predicting a chain of events rather than simplifying a cause.

Wait, there's also the "false dichotomy," which presents two options as if they are the only possibilities when there are more. But that's not exactly about cause either.

Oh, what about the "appeal to ignorance"? That's arguing that since something isn't known to be false, it must be true. Not related to cause simplification.

I think the fallacy I'm looking for is called "complex cause." Let me see. The complex cause fallacy, also known as the "fallacy of the single cause," occurs when someone attributes an event to a single cause when in reality the event is the result of multiple, perhaps complex, causes. This seems to fit the question perfectly.

Looking at the options, option B is "complex cause." So I think that's the correct answer. Let me just cross-check. The description says the cause is simple when it's actually complicated. Yep, that's exactly what complex cause fallacy is about. So I'm confident the answer is B.

The question asks which fallacy occurs when someone attributes the cause of an event to a simple cause when it is actually more complicated. This is known as the "complex cause" fallacy, where an event is oversimplified by assigning it to a single cause rather than recognizing the multiple, complex factors at play. 

Option B, "complex cause," fits this description perfectly.

Answer: B
