Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about why, according to Hakim (1995, 1996), most part-time work is done by women. Let me start by recalling what I know about Catherine Hakim's work.

I remember that Hakim discussed women's work patterns, particularly in the context of their life choices. She introduced the idea of the "preference theory," which suggests that women often choose part-time work because it fits better with their domestic and family responsibilities. So, the idea is that women make a rational decision to balance their work and home life.

Looking at the options:

Option A says full-time work isn't available in the fields women want. I'm not sure if Hakim focused on availability or more on choice.

Option B suggests women prefer part-time for work-life balance. That sounds similar to what I remember, but maybe it's too vague.

Option C says part-time offers flexible hours for domestic work. This also aligns because managing home responsibilities is a big factor.

Option D mentions a rational choice to combine employment with home-centered lives. Oh, right, I think Hakim talked about women making a choice based on their priorities, which are often centered around the home.

Option E says part-time is less demanding. I don't recall Hakim emphasizing the nature of the work being less demanding, more about the hours.

Option F points to structural constraints like childcare costs. While that's a real issue, I think Hakim's argument was more about preferences than structural barriers.

Option G is about employers hiring women due to stereotypes. That's more of a discrimination angle, which might not be what Hakim was focusing on here.

Option H says part-time allows time for personal development. I don't think that's the main point she made.

Option I suggests more part-time opportunities for women. Maybe, but again, Hakim's point was more about choice than availability.

Option J says part-time pays high wages. That doesn't sound right because part-time jobs often pay less.

So narrowing it down, options B, C, D are the strongest. But I think the key here is the "rational choice" aspect. Hakim argued that women make a deliberate choice to combine work with their home-centered lives. So that would point to option D.

Wait, but option C is about managing domestic responsibilities, which is part of that choice. So both C and D seem relevant. How do they differ? Option C is more about the practical aspect of flexible hours, while D is about the choice to combine employment with home life, which is more the underlying reason.

Hakim's theory is about women making a choice based on their priorities, so D seems more accurate. So the answer should be D.

The question asks why, according to Hakim (1995, 1996), the majority of part-time work is done by women. Hakim's work emphasizes that women make a rational choice to combine employment with their "home-centred" lives, reflecting their priorities and life circumstances. Among the options, D aligns most closely with this reasoning, as it captures the essence of women's deliberate decision-making to balance work and domestic responsibilities.

Answer: D
