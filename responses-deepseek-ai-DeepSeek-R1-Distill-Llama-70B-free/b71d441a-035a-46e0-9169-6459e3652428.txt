Okay, so I have this GDP question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about what's included in the U.S. GDP. There are four statements, I to IV, and I need to figure out which ones are part of U.S. GDP.

First, I remember that GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product. From what I've studied, GDP measures the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders over a specific time period. It's about where the production happens, not where the goods are sold or who owns the company.

So, looking at each statement one by one:

I. The market value of movies made in Africa by U.S. citizens.
Hmm, the key here is where the movies were made. Since they were made in Africa, the production isn't in the U.S. Even though the citizens are American, the location matters. So this wouldn't count towards U.S. GDP.

II. The market value of olive oil made in Italy and sold in the United States.
This is about olive oil produced in Italy. Since it's made there, it's part of Italy's GDP, not the U.S. So when it's sold in the U.S., that's just an import for the U.S., but the production isn't in the U.S., so it doesn't count here.

III. The market value of blue jeans made in the United States and sold in Japan.
Okay, these blue jeans were produced in the U.S. So even though they're sold in Japan, the fact that they were made here means they're included in U.S. GDP. Exports are part of GDP because they're part of domestic production.

IV. The market value of wine made in the United States by Canadian citizens.
The production is in the U.S., so it doesn't matter if the citizens are Canadian. As long as the wine is produced domestically, it's part of U.S. GDP.

So reviewing each:

I: Not included (made in Africa)
II: Not included (made in Italy)
III: Included (made in U.S., sold abroad)
IV: Included (made in U.S.)

So which statements are included? III and IV.

Looking at the options, option G says III and IV only. So the correct answer should be G.

The correct answer is:

G: III and IV only

Answer: G
