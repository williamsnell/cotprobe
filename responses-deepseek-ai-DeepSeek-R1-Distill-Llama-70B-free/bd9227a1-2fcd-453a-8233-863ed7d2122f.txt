Okay, so I have this problem here about Harry Hyppeis getting paid, and I need to figure out how much he'll earn. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says Harry is paid a straight wage of $2.89 (1/2) per hour. Hmm, wait, that part is a bit confusing. The way it's written, $2.89 (1/2). I think that might mean $2.89 and a half dollars per hour. Like, sometimes people say two and a half dollars as $2.50. So maybe this is $2.89 plus half a dollar? Let me think. Oh wait, no, wait. If it's $2.89 (1/2), maybe it's $2.89 and a half cents? Or wait, perhaps it's $2.89 per hour plus half of something else. Or maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be $2.895, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe it's $2.89 per hour, and the (1/2) refers to something else, like time and a half pay, but that's usually for overtime, which isn't mentioned here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the question again. It says a straight wage of $2.89 (1/2) per hour. So perhaps the amount is $2.89 and a half, meaning $2.89 plus $0.50, which would make it $3.39 per hour? Or maybe the (1/2) is indicating a fraction, like $2.89 and a half dollar, so $3.39. Alternatively, maybe it's (1/2) of a cent, but that seems unlikely. But wait, 2.89 is in dollars, so adding half a dollar would make sense. So I think the wage is $2.89 plus $0.50, totaling $3.39 per hour.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes in old terms, people might denote half a dollar as (1/2). So $2.89 (1/2) could be $2.89 and a half, which is $3.39. Alternatively, it could be a way of writing $2.895, but that's more like $2.90 when rounded. But I think the first interpretation is correct, that it's $2.89 and a half, so $3.39 per hour.

Alternatively, maybe it's $2.89 for the first part, and then an additional half, but I'm not sure. Let's test both possibilities.

Wait, let's see what the options are. The options are all around $140 to $200, so let's see.

If the wage is $3.39 per hour, and he works 9 hours a day for 6 days, then 9 * 6 is 54 hours. 54 hours * $3.39 per hour equals what?

Let me calculate that. 54 * 3 is 162, 54 * 0.39 is... 0.39 *54. 0.3 *54 is 16.2, 0.09 *54 is 4.86. So 16.2 +4.86 is 21.06. So total is 162 +21.06 = $183.06. Hmm, but looking at the options, F is $180.54, which is close but not exactly that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 54 * 3.39 again. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 54 * 3 = 162, 54 * 0.39 = ?

Wait, 0.39 * 54: let's compute 54 * 0.3 = 16.2, 54 * 0.09 = 4.86. Adding them gives 21.06. So total is 162 +21.06=183.06. So the total would be $183.06.

Looking at the options, there's no 183.06. The closest is option F at 180.54, which is a bit lower. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated the wage. Alternatively, perhaps the (1/2) doesn't mean an additional $0.50 but something else.

Wait another thought: perhaps the (1/2) is indicating that the wage is $2.89 and a half cents, but that would be $2.895, which is approximately $2.90, but that seems unlikely because the options are in whole dollars and cents.

Alternatively, maybe the (1/2) is indicating that the rate is $2.89 plus half of the minimum wage or something else, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial wage. Maybe the "1/2" is part of the dollar amount, like $2.89 and a half, so $3.39, as I thought before. But that gives me 183.06, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: $168.21

B: $150.48

C: $156.33

D: $174.96

E: $192.78

F: $180.54

G: $165.00

H: $139.23

I: $198.72

J: $142.05

So none match 183.06. So perhaps my initial assumption about the wage is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, another interpretation: the "straight wage of $2.89 (1/2) per hour" could mean that Harry is paid $2.89 plus half of that rate. So for example, 2.89 plus half of 2.89, which would be 2.89 +1.445=4.335 per hour. Let's see what that gives.

So 9 hours/day * 6 days =54 hours.

54 * 4.335 = let's compute that.

54 *4=216, 54*0.335= approx 18.09. So total is 216+18.09=234.09. That's way higher than any of the options, so that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe the (1/2) isn't an addition but a multiplier. Alternatively, perhaps the (1/2) is a way of writing 0.5, so the total is 2.89 + 0.5=3.39, which is what I thought earlier. But that didn't match.

Wait, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let's compute the options based on possible wages.

If the wage is $2.89 per hour, then 54 hours would be 54*2.89. Let me compute that.

2.89 * 54: 2*54=108, 0.89*54=48.06. So total is 108+48.06=156.06. Hmm, looking at the options, C is $156.33, which is close. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, 2.89 *54:

Let me compute 2.89 *50=144.5, 2.89*4=11.56. So 144.5+11.56=156.06. So that's $156.06, which is option C at 156.33. Hmm, but that's off by 27 cents. Maybe the (1/2) in the wage is adding half a cent, making it 2.895, so 2.895 *54.

2.895 *54: let's compute 2.895 *50=144.75, 2.895*4=11.58. So 144.75+11.58=156.33. Oh! That's exactly option C, $156.33.

Wait, so perhaps the (1/2) in the wage is half a cent, making the wage $2.895 per hour, which is 2.89 and a half cent. Because 0.5 cents is half a cent, so 2.89 + 0.005 = 2.895.

So then, 54 hours *2.895 per hour equals:

As I calculated, 2.895 *54=156.33, which is option C.

But wait, the original problem says "$2.89 (1/2)", which I think is more likely to be $2.89 and a half dollar, making it $3.39, but that gives a total that's not in the options. So perhaps the correct interpretation is that the (1/2) is half a cent, making the wage $2.895, and the total $156.33, which is option C.

Alternatively, maybe the (1/2) is indicating something else. Let me see: in some contexts, (1/2) after a number could mean "and a half", so perhaps $2.89 and a half cents, which would be $2.895. Alternatively, maybe it's a way of writing $2.89 per hour with an additional half-hourly rate, but that seems more complicated.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the wage is $2.89 plus half of the minimum wage, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's $2.89 per hour for the first, say, 40 hours, and time and a half after that, but the problem states it's a straight wage, so no overtime.

Wait, the problem says "straight wage", which usually means no overtime or other adjustments, so it's just the regular pay. So perhaps the (1/2) is just part of the rate, making it $2.895 per hour.

So, if the wage is $2.895 per hour, then 54 hours would give 2.895 *54 =156.33, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the (1/2) is a mistake, and the intended wage is $2.89 per hour, making the total 156.06, which is close to option C at 156.33. The slight difference could be due to rounding, but perhaps the exact calculation is 54*2.89=156.06, but the option is 156.33, which is exactly 2.89 *54=?

Wait, let me check 2.89 *54 again.

2.89 *54:

Let's compute 2.89 * 54:

2.89 * 50 = 144.5

2.89 *4=11.56

Adding together: 144.5 +11.56=156.06.

So that's $156.06, but option C is $156.33. That's a 27 cent difference. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the (1/2) is adding half a dollar to each hour's wage. So 2.89 +0.5=3.39 per hour, but as I calculated earlier, 54*3.39=183.06, which isn't an option.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the (1/2) is indicating that the rate is $2.89 for the first half of the hour and something else for the other half, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the (1/2) is a way of indicating a fraction of an hour, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the (1/2) is indicating that the wage is $2.89 plus half of the previous dollar amount. That would be 2.89 + (2.89 /2) = 2.89 +1.445=4.335 per hour. But that gives a total of 54*4.335=234.09, which isn't an option.

So I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let's look at the answer options and see which one makes sense.

If I take option C: $156.33. That would mean the hourly wage is 156.33 /54 â‰ˆ2.893 per hour, which is approximately $2.893, which is 2.89 and 3/10 of a cent. So that would fit with the (1/2) being 0.5 cents, making 2.895, which when multiplied by 54 gives 156.33.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C, $156.33.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the (1/2) in the wage is a way of writing 2.89 and a half, meaning $2.89 + $0.50, making it $3.39 per hour. Then 54*3.39=183.06, which isn't an option, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 54 *3.39 again.

3.39 *54:

3 *54=162.

0.39*54=21.06.

So 162+21.06=183.06, which is not among the options.

So perhaps that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the (1/2) is indicating that the wage is $2.89 for a half-hour, so the hourly rate would be double that, $5.78 per hour. Then 54 *5.78=?

Wait, 50*5.78=289, 4*5.78=23.12. So 289+23.12=312.12, which is way higher than any option, so that's not possible.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of what each option would imply.

Option C is $156.33. So 156.33 /54 hours equals approximately $2.893 per hour. So that's $2.89 plus 0.3 cents, which doesn't make much sense, but perhaps the (1/2) is a half cent, making the wage $2.895.

Alternatively, perhaps the (1/2) is a mistake, and the intended wage is $2.89 per hour, making the total 54*2.89=156.06, which is close to option C's 156.33.

Wait, perhaps the problem meant $2.89 per hour, and the (1/2) is a typo or something. In that case, option C would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the (1/2) refers to something else, like a 50% bonus or something, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the (1/2) is indicating that the wage is $2.89 plus half of the minimum wage. But without knowing the minimum wage, that's impossible to calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a misprint, and the actual wage is $2.89 per hour, making the total 54 *2.89=156.06, which is approximately option C, 156.33, perhaps with some rounding.

So, considering all possibilities, I think the intended answer is option C, $156.33.
</think>

The problem states that Harry Hyppeis is paid a straight wage of $2.89 (1/2) per hour. The interpretation of "$2.89 (1/2)" is crucial. After analyzing the options and the calculations, the most plausible interpretation is that the wage is $2.895 per hour, where "(1/2)" represents half a cent. 

To calculate Harry's total earnings:
- He works 9 hours per day for 6 days, totaling \( 9 \times 6 = 54 \) hours.
- At $2.895 per hour, the total earnings are \( 54 \times 2.895 = 156.33 \).

This matches option C: $156.33. Other interpretations of the wage (e.g., $3.39 per hour) result in totals that do not align with the provided options. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: $156.33

Answer: C
