Okay, so I've got this question here about convex sets and something called S_a. Hmm, let me try to break it down. Alright, the question is whether S_a is convex when S is convex. I remember that a convex set is one where, for any two points in the set, the line segment connecting them is entirely within the set.

So, S is convex. Now, S_a is defined as all points x such that the distance from x to S is less than or equal to a. Oh right, the distance here is the infimum of the norm of x minus y for y in S. So S_a is like all the points within a distance a from S. I think this is called the epsilon-neighborhood or the closed neighborhood around S.

Wait, so S_a would include all points that are within 'a' units away from any point in S. If I imagine S as a convex shape, like a circle or a square, then S_a would be like expanding that shape outward by a distance a. So for a convex set, would expanding it by a uniform distance on all sides result in another convex set?

Let me think about this. Suppose S is a line segment, which is convex. S_a would then be a rectangle with rounded ends, like a sausage shape. Oh wait, no, actually, when you take the Minkowski sum of a convex set with a ball, you get another convex set. Because Minkowski sum preserves convexity. Since S is convex and a ball (which is convex) is added to it, the resulting set S_a should be convex.

Wait, wait. The Minkowski sum of two convex sets is convex. So S_a is the Minkowski sum of S and a closed ball of radius a. Since both are convex, their sum should be convex. So yes, S_a is convex.

Alternatively, think about taking two points in S_a. Each point is within distance a from S. So for any two points x and y in S_a, the line segment between them must also be in S_a. Because for any point z on that segment, the distance from z to S would be at most the maximum of the distances from x and y to S, which is <=a. Wait, that might not be strictly accurate. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of triangle inequality.

Let me formalize that. Take any two points u and v in S_a. That means there exist points p and q in S such that ||u - p|| ≤ a and ||v - q|| ≤ a. Now, consider a point w on the line segment between u and v, so w = (1-t)u + t v for some t in [0,1].

I need to show that w is in S_a, which means that the distance from w to S is ≤ a. So, the distance from w to S is the infimum of ||w - s|| for s in S.

Hmm, maybe I can express w in terms of p and q. Let me see: w is (1-t)u + t v. Since u is close to p and v is close to q, maybe I can approximate w as being close to a point in S.

Wait, but S is convex, so any point on the line between p and q is in S. So let me think: Let's take s = (1-t)p + t q, which is in S because S is convex. Then, the distance from w to s is ||w - s|| = ||(1-t)(u - p) + t(v - q)|| ≤ (1-t)||u - p|| + t||v - q|| ≤ (1-t)a + t a = a.

So, the distance from w to s is ≤a, which means that dist(w, S) ≤a. Thus, w is in S_a. Since this holds for any w on the segment between u and v, S_a is convex.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, meaning return 1. Looking at the options, option D is 1.0.

To determine whether \( S_a \) is convex when \( S \) is convex, we analyze the definition of \( S_a \) and the properties of convex sets. \( S_a \) is defined as the set of all points \( x \) such that the distance from \( x \) to \( S \) is at most \( a \), i.e., \( S_a = \{ x \mid \text{dist}(x, S) \leq a \} \), where \( \text{dist}(x, S) = \inf_{y \in S} \|x - y\| \). This makes \( S_a \) the closed \( a \)-neighborhood of \( S \).

For \( S_a \) to be convex, it must satisfy the property that for any two points \( u, v \in S_a \), the entire line segment connecting \( u \) and \( v \) lies within \( S_a \). Since \( S \) is convex, the Minkowski sum of \( S \) with a closed ball of radius \( a \) (which is also convex) preserves convexity. Thus, \( S_a \), being the Minkowski sum of \( S \) and a ball, is convex.

To confirm this, consider two points \( u \) and \( v \) in \( S_a \). By definition, there exist points \( p \) and \( q \) in \( S \) such that \( \|u - p\| \leq a \) and \( \|v - q\| \leq a \). For any point \( w \) on the line segment between \( u \) and \( v \), \( w = (1-t)u + t v \) for some \( t \in [0, 1] \). The corresponding point \( s = (1-t)p + t q \) lies in \( S \) because \( S \) is convex. The distance from \( w \) to \( s \) is bounded by:

\[
\|w - s\| = \|(1-t)(u - p) + t(v - q)\| \leq (1-t)\|u - p\| + t\|v - q\| \leq (1-t)a + ta = a.
\]

Thus, \( \text{dist}(w, S) \leq a \), meaning \( w \in S_a \). Since this holds for all \( w \) on the segment between \( u \) and \( v \), \( S_a \) is convex.

Therefore, the answer is **1.0**, corresponding to option D.
