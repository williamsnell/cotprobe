Question:

A landlord is the owner in fee simple of a tract of land on which is situated a large office building. The landlord leases the land and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years, commencing on August 1, 2001, and terminating at midnight on July 31, 2008. The lease contains the following provisions:"(1) The tenant covenants to pay the rent of $750 per month on the first day of each month. "After three years of the lease had expired, the tenant assigned the entire balance of the lease period to an attorney, who took immediate possession of the leased property. Then in 2005, the attorney assigned his leasehold interest to a doctor. The doctor went into possession, but failed to pay any rent for two months. After the doctor failed to make his rental payments for the first two months of his lease, the landlord brought suit against the tenant to recover for the unpaid rent. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the tenant, because he was not directly responsible for the doctor's failure to pay rent.
B: the landlord, because the tenant and the assignees breached the lease agreement.
C: the tenant, because the landlord did not take action when the doctor failed to pay rent.
D: the tenant, because the doctor, as assignee, would only be held liable.
E: the tenant, because the landlord did not formally approve the assignments.
F: the landlord, because he did not object to the assignments.
G: the landlord, because the doctor, as the final assignee, failed to fulfill his obligation to pay rent.
H: the tenant, because his assignment to the attorney constituted a novation, thereby extinguishing his obligation to pay rent.
I: the landlord, because the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments.
J: the landlord, because the attorney failed to pay rent for two months.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this landlord-tenant law question. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the setup is that a landlord owns a tract of land with an office building and leased it to a tenant for seven years, starting August 1, 2001, and ending July 31, 2008. The lease says the tenant has to pay $750 monthly on the first day of each month.

After three years, so that would be around August 2004, the tenant assigned the entire remaining lease period to an attorney, who took possession. Then, in 2005, the attorney assigned his interest to a doctor. The doctor moved in but didn't pay rent for the first two months. The landlord then sued the tenant for the unpaid rent.

The question is asking who should win the caseâ€”landlord or tenant?

I remember that when a tenant assigns a lease, the original tenant is usually still liable unless there's a novation. A novation would require the landlord's agreement to release the tenant and accept the new tenant. So, if there's no novation, the tenant remains responsible.

In this case, the lease was assigned first to the attorney and then to the doctor. The question doesn't mention the landlord agreeing to any novation. So, the tenant's assignment doesn't release him from liability.

So, when the doctor fails to pay rent, the landlord can go after the tenant because the tenant is still on the hook. The lease terms probably require the tenant to pay regardless of who is using the property.

Looking at the options:

Option I says the landlord should win because the tenant's obligation survived the assignments. That makes sense because without a novation, the tenant remains liable.

Other options: A says the tenant isn't responsible for the doctor. But we know that's not true because the tenant is still liable unless released. E says the landlord didn't approve the assignments, but assignments usually don't require approval unless the lease says so. The question doesn't mention any such clause, so E might not be correct.

H says there was a novation, but the question doesn't indicate the landlord agreed, so H is likely wrong.

So, the correct answer should be I.

The correct answer is I. The landlord should prevail because the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments. Assignments do not release the original tenant from liability unless there is a novation, which requires the landlord's agreement. Here, there was no indication of a novation, so the tenant remains liable for unpaid rent.
