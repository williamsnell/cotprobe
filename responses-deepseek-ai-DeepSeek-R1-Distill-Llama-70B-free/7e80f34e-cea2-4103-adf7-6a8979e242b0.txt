Okay, so I need to find the GCD of 25 and 55. Hmm, GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor, right? That's the largest number that can divide both numbers without leaving a remainder. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I can figure it out.

Let me start by recalling what factors are. Factors are numbers that you can multiply together to get another number. So for 25, the factors are 1, 5, 25 because 5 times 5 is 25. For 55, the factors would be 1, 5, 11, and 55 because 5 times 11 is 55. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check: 5 times 11 is indeed 55, so yes.

Now, to find the GCD, I need to find the common factors of both 25 and 55 and then pick the largest one. Looking at the factors I listed, both numbers have 1 and 5 as factors. So the common factors are 1 and 5. Between those, 5 is larger. So the GCD should be 5.

Wait, let me think if there's another way to do this, maybe using the Euclidean algorithm. I remember that the Euclidean algorithm is a method where you divide the larger number by the smaller one and then use the remainder to continue the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

Let me try that. The two numbers are 55 and 25. So I divide 55 by 25. 25 times 2 is 50, which is less than 55, and the remainder is 5 (55 minus 50). Now, I take the previous divisor, which is 25, and divide it by the remainder 5. 5 goes into 25 exactly 5 times with no remainder. So since the remainder is now zero, the last non-zero remainder is 5. That confirms my earlier answer that the GCD is 5.

Looking back at the options provided: 

A: 275
B:15
C:20
D:50
E:11
F:30
G:5
H:10
I:25
J:35

The correct answer is G:5.

The GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of 25 and 55 is found by identifying the largest number that divides both without a remainder. The factors of 25 are 1, 5, 25, and the factors of 55 are 1, 5, 11, 55. The common factors are 1 and 5, with 5 being the largest. Using the Euclidean algorithm, dividing 55 by 25 gives a remainder of 5, and then dividing 25 by 5 gives no remainder, confirming the GCD is 5.

From the options, the correct answer is G:5.
