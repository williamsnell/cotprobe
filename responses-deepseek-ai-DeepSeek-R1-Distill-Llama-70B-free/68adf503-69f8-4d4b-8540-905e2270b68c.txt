Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the magnitude of the spin magnetic moment of an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to think it through.

I remember that the magnetic moment is related to the spin of a particle. Electrons have spin-½, right? And their magnetic moment is measured in units of the Bohr magneton. Oh wait, what's the Bohr magneton again? I think it's a physical constant and represents the magnetic moment of an electron.

The formula for the magnetic moment (μ) of an electron is μ = -g * (μ_B) * (S), where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and S is the spin. Wait, but for electrons, the spin is ħ/2, right? Or maybe in terms of units, the spin quantum number s is 1/2, so the magnitude of spin S would be sqrt(s(s+1))ħ. Wait, no, wait. Spin magnetic moment for an electron, maybe I should just recall the standard value.

Wait, the electron's spin magnetic moment is approximately the Bohr magneton. Oh, but wait, the Bohr magneton μ_B is about 9.27e-24 J/T. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The spin quantum number s for an electron is 1/2. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * μ_B * m_s, where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, no, that's the formula for orbital magnetic moment maybe. Or wait, no, for spin, the formula is similar but the g-factor is different. Oh right, the Landé g-factor for spin is approximately 2. So for an electron, the spin magnetic moment is μ = g_s * μ_B * (s), where s is the spin quantum number, which is 1/2.

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is μ = g_s * (μ_B) * (s), where s is 1/2. So the calculation would be μ = 2 * (μ_B) * (1/2). Oh wait, that would make μ equal to μ_B, right? Because 2*(1/2) is 1, so μ = μ_B.

But wait, the Bohr magneton is about 9.27e-24 J/T. So if the spin magnetic moment is equal to the Bohr magneton, then the magnitude should be around 9.27e-24 J/T. Let me check the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1.23e-23 J/T → 1.23e-23 is larger than 9.27e-24.

Option B: 3.26e-23 → much larger.

Option C: 2.20e-23 → also larger.

Option D: 0.91e-23 → about 9.1e-24, which is close to 9.27e-24.

Wait, so option D is 0.91e-23, which is 9.1e-24. Hmm, very close to the Bohr magneton value. But wait, the exact value might depend on precise calculations.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: the spin magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * g, where g is approximately 2 for electrons. So let's compute it.

The constants: e is the charge of electron, 1.6e-19 C. ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. m_e is the mass of electron, 9.109e-31 kg.

So putting it all together:

μ = (e * ħ) / (2 m_e) * g. Since g is approximately 2 for electrons, let me substitute:

μ = (1.6e-19 C * 1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 9.109e-31 kg) ) * 2.

Wait, but the 2s would cancel out. Let me compute this.

Wait, let's compute the numerator first: 1.6e-19 * 1.0545718e-34 = ?

1.6 * 1.0545718 ≈ 1.687. So 1.687e-53.

Denominator: 2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30.

So (1.687e-53) / (1.8218e-30) ) = approximately (1.687 / 1.8218) * 1e-23.

1.687 / 1.8218 ≈ 0.926, so 0.926e-23 J/T, since the units would be (C·J·s)/(kg·J/T) which I'm not 100% on, but I think it comes out to J/T.

Wait, but I multiplied by g=2, but in the formula, the 2 in the denominator and the g=2 would cancel. Let me see:

Wait, the initial formula is μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * g. So substituting g=2, the 2's cancel, so μ = (eħ)/(m_e) * (1/2) * 2? Wait, no.

Wait, let me clarify:

The formula is μ = (g * e * ħ) / (2 * 2m_e) )? Or perhaps I'm mixing up the factors.

Wait, maybe the correct formula for the spin magnetic moment is μ = g_s * (μ_B) * s, where s is the spin. For an electron, s = 1/2, and g_s is approximately 2.

μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is (eħ)/(2m_e). So putting it together:

μ = g_s * μ_B * s.

g_s is 2, s is 1/2.

So μ = 2 * μ_B * (1/2) = μ_B.

So μ equals the Bohr magneton, which is 9.27e-24 J/T.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 0.91e-23 J/T, which is 9.1e-24. That's very close to 9.27e-24.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Alternatively, perhaps the spin magnetic moment is given by μ = (g_e/2) * μ_B, where g_e is the electron g-factor, approximately 2. So μ would be (2/2)*μ_B = μ_B. So same result.

But wait, if I calculate μ_B numerically.

μ_B = (eħ)/(2 m_e).

Calculating:

e = 1.602176634e-19 C
ħ = 1.054571817e-34 J·s
m_e = 9.1093837015e-31 kg

So μ_B = (1.602176634e-19 C * 1.054571817e-34 J·s) / (2 * 9.1093837015e-31 kg).

Let me compute numerator: 1.602176634e-19 * 1.054571817e-34 =

Multiply the numbers: 1.602176634 * 1.054571817 ≈ 1.69.

So 1.69e-53 C·J·s.

Denominator: 2 * 9.1093837015e-31 = 1.8218767403e-30 kg.

So μ_B = (1.69e-53) / (1.8218767403e-30) ) J·s·C/(kg).

Wait, what's the unit? Because J is kg·m²/s², and C is charge, so J·s·C would be kg·m²/s² * s * C = kg·m²·C/s. Hmm, but the unit for magnetic moment is J/T (since magnetic moment times magnetic field gives energy: μ·B is energy, so μ is energy per tesla, which is J/T).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting lost here, but in any case, the numerical calculation:

1.69e-53 / 1.8218767403e-30 = (1.69 / 1.8218767403) * 1e-23.

1.69 divided by 1.82188 is approximately 0.928. So 0.928e-23 J/T, which is 9.28e-24 J/T.

That's almost exactly the value of the Bohr magneton, which is 9.27e-24 J/T as per standard constants.

Looking back at the options, option D is 0.91e-23, which is 9.1e-24. That's very close.

Wait, but 9.28e-24 is closer to 9.3e-24. So perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, e is 1.602176634e-19, ħ is 1.054571817e-34, m_e is 9.1093837015e-31.

Compute numerator: e * ħ = (1.602176634e-19) * (1.054571817e-34) = let me compute this more accurately.

1.602176634 * 1.054571817 ≈ Let's calculate:

1.602176634 * 1 = 1.602176634

1.602176634 * 0.054571817 ≈ 1.602176634 * 0.05 = 0.0801088317, and 1.602176634 * 0.004571817 ≈ approximately 0.007322. So total for 0.054571817 is about 0.08743.

Total numerator without exponents: 1.60218 + 0.08743 ≈ 1.6896.

So 1.6896e-53 (since 1e-19 * 1e-34 = 1e-53).

Denominator: 2 * m_e = 2 * 9.1093837015e-31 = 1.8218767403e-30.

So μ_B = (1.6896e-53) / (1.8218767403e-30) ) = (1.6896 / 1.82187674) ) * 1e-23.

Calculating 1.6896 ÷ 1.82187674:

1.82187674 * 0.926 = approx 1.6896.

Yes, so 0.926 * 1e-23 J/T → 9.26e-24 J/T.

So the value is approximately 9.26e-24 J/T.

Which is very close to option D, which is 0.91e-23 = 9.1e-24, but perhaps there's a more precise option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: 0.91e-23 → 9.1e-24.

Option G: 1.47e-23 → 1.47e-23 is 14.7e-24, which is way larger.

Option E: 1.61e-23 → 16.1e-24.

So D is the closest.

Wait, but wait, in some sources, the spin magnetic moment is given as μ = (g_s μ_B ) / 2, which would make it (2 * μ_B ) / 2 = μ_B, same result.

Alternatively, perhaps I've forgotten a factor somewhere. Another approach: the formula for the electron's spin magnetic moment is μ = (eħ)/(2m_e), which is exactly μ_B. So that's correct.

Therefore, the magnitude is approximately 9.27e-24 J/T.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 0.91e-23 J/T, which is 9.1e-24 J/T.

But wait, let me check the options again. Oh, option D is 0.91e-23, which is 9.1e-24. That's very close to the calculated 9.26e-24. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but wait another thing. I thought the spin magnetic moment is given as μ = (g_s/2) * μ_B * s, but s is 1/2. So:

μ = (g_s/2) * μ_B * (1/2) * 2? No, perhaps s is sqrt(s(s+1))ħ, but for s=1/2, it's sqrt(3/4) ħ. Wait, no, because when calculating the magnetic moment, the formula involves the quantum numbers differently.

Wait, let me clarify. The spin magnetic dipole moment for an electron is given by μ = g_s * μ_B * m_s, where m_s is the magnetic quantum number, which can be ±1/2.

But the magnitude would be μ = g_s * μ_B * (1/2), because m_s is 1/2.

So μ = 2 * μ_B * (1/2) ) → μ_B.

Wait, that's the same result as before. So the magnitude is μ_B, which is about 9.27e-24 J/T.

So yes, the correct option is D: 0.91e-23 J/T → 9.1e-24 J/T.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be D.

To calculate the magnitude of the spin magnetic moment of an electron, we start with the formula:

\[
\mu = g_s \cdot \mu_B \cdot m_s
\]

Here:
- \( g_s \) is the electron g-factor, approximately \( 2 \),
- \( \mu_B \) is the Bohr magneton, given by \( \mu_B = \frac{e \hbar}{2 m_e} \),
- \( m_s \) is the spin magnetic quantum number, which is \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) for an electron.

The magnitude of the spin magnetic moment is:

\[
\mu = g_s \cdot \mu_B \cdot \frac{1}{2}
\]

Substituting \( g_s = 2 \), the formula simplifies to:

\[
\mu = \mu_B
\]

The Bohr magneton \( \mu_B \) is calculated using the fundamental constants:
- \( e = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \) (charge of the electron),
- \( \hbar = 1.054571817 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \) (reduced Planck's constant),
- \( m_e = 9.1093837015 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg} \) (mass of the electron).

\[
\mu_B = \frac{e \hbar}{2 m_e}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
e \cdot \hbar = (1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (1.054571817 \times 10^{-34}) = 1.6896 \times 10^{-53} \, \mathrm{C \cdot J \cdot s}
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 m_e = 2 \cdot (9.1093837015 \times 10^{-31}) = 1.8218767403 \times 10^{-30} \, \mathrm{kg}
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
\mu_B = \frac{1.6896 \times 10^{-53}}{1.8218767403 \times 10^{-30}} = 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \mathrm{J/T}
\]

Thus, the magnitude of the spin magnetic moment of the electron is approximately \( 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \mathrm{J/T} \).

Comparing this result to the given options:
- Option A: \( 1.23 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/T} \) is too large.
- Option B: \( 3.26 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/T} \) is much too large.
- Option C: \( 2.20 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/T} \) is too large.
- Option D: \( 0.91 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/T} = 9.1 \times 10^{-24} \, \mathrm{J/T} \), which is very close to the calculated value.
- Option E: \( 1.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/T} \) is too large.
- Option F: \( 1.80 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/T} \) is too large.
- Option G: \( 1.47 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/T} \) is too large.
- Option H: \( 2.01 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/T} \) is too large.
- Option I: \( 1.00 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/T} \) is too large.
- Option J: \( 2.54 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/T} \) is much too large.

The closest match is **Option D: \( 0.91 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/T} \)**, which corresponds to \( 9.1 \times 10^{-24} \, \mathrm{J/T} \), very close to the calculated value of \( 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \mathrm{J/T} \).

Answer: D
