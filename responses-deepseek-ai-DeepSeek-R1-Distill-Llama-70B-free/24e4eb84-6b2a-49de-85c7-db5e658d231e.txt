Okay, so I have this differential equation to solve. The problem is an initial value problem, and I need to find the value of y0 such that the solution touches but doesn't cross the t-axis. Hmm, I remember that touching the t-axis without crossing would mean the solution just touches it at a point, so maybe the solution has a repeated root or something like that. Oh wait, that's when the graph just touches the axis, right? Like a double root.

The equation given is y' + (2/3)y = 1 - (1/2)t. So it's a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. I think I need to solve this using an integrating factor. 

The standard form for such an equation is y' + P(t)y = Q(t). Here, P(t) is 2/3 and Q(t) is 1 - (1/2)t. So the integrating factor would be e^(∫P(t) dt), which is e^(∫(2/3) dt). Let me compute that integral. ∫(2/3) dt is (2/3)t, so the integrating factor is e^( (2/3)t ).

Multiplying both sides of the equation by the integrating factor:

e^( (2/3)t ) y' + (2/3)e^( (2/3)t ) y = (1 - (1/2)t) e^( (2/3)t )

The left side should now be the derivative of (y * integrating factor). So,

d/dt [ y * e^( (2/3)t ) ] = (1 - (1/2)t) e^( (2/3)t )

Next, integrate both sides with respect to t to find y:

y * e^( (2/3)t ) = ∫ (1 - (1/2)t) e^( (2/3)t ) dt + C

Hmm, this integral looks a bit tricky. Maybe I can use integration by parts. Let me set u = 1 - (1/2)t, dv = e^( (2/3)t ) dt. Then du = (-1/2) dt, and v = (3/2) e^( (2/3)t ), since ∫e^(kt) dt = (1/k)e^(kt).

Wait, let me check that. Wait, the integral of e^(at) dt is (1/a)e^(at), right. So here, a is 2/3, so v would be (3/2) e^( (2/3)t ).

So using integration by parts:

∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du

So,

∫ (1 - (1/2)t) e^( (2/3)t ) dt = (1 - (1/2)t) * (3/2) e^( (2/3)t ) - ∫ (3/2)e^( (2/3)t ) * (-1/2) dt

Simplify each part:

First term: (3/2)(1 - t/2) e^( (2t/3) )

Second term: The integral becomes (3/2)(1/2) ∫ e^( (2t/3) ) dt = (3/4) * (3/2) e^( (2t/3) ) + C, because the integral of e^(at) is (1/a)e^(at).

Wait, let me compute it step by step:

The integral part is ∫ (3/2) e^( (2/3)t ) * (1/2) dt. Wait, I think I messed up the signs. The original is:

= (1 - (1/2)t)(3/2 e^(2t/3)) - ∫ (3/2 e^(2t/3)) (-1/2) dt

So the integral becomes + (3/2)(1/2) ∫ e^(2t/3) dt.

So (3/2)*(1/2) = 3/4. So the integral is 3/4 ∫ e^(2t/3) dt.

The integral of e^(2t/3) is (3/2) e^(2t/3). So multiplying that by 3/4 gives (3/4)(3/2) e^(2t/3) = (9/8) e^(2t/3).

Putting it all together, the integral is:

(3/2)(1 - t/2) e^(2t/3) + (9/8) e^(2t/3) + C

Wait, wait, let me make sure:

Wait, the integration by parts formula is ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. So when I do that substitution, I have:

∫ (1 - (1/2)t) e^(2t/3) dt = (1 - (1/2)t)(3/2 e^(2t/3)) ) - ∫ (3/2 e^(2t/3)) (-1/2) dt

Which simplifies to:

(3/2)(1 - t/2) e^(2t/3) + (3/4) ∫ e^(2t/3) dt.

Then, the integral is (3/4) * (3/2) e^(2t/3) + C.

So (3/4)(3/2) is 9/8, so the integral becomes:

(3/2)(1 - t/2) e^(2t/3) + (9/8) e^(2t/3) + C

Wait, but that's just the integral. So going back to the solution:

y e^(2t/3) = (3/2)(1 - t/2) e^(2t/3) + (9/8) e^(2t/3) + C

Wait, wait, no, no. Because when we integrated both sides, the right side was the integral, so the left side is y * e^(2t/3) equals that integral plus C.

Wait, no, let me correct that. So the equation after integrating both sides is:

y e^(2t/3) = [ (3/2)(1 - t/2) e^(2t/3) + (9/8) e^(2t/3) ) ] + C

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Maybe I made a mistake in the integration by parts. Let me try to compute that integral again more carefully.

Let me set u = 1 - (1/2)t, dv = e^(2t/3) dt.

Then du = (-1/2) dt, v = (3/2) e^(2t/3).

So the integral becomes u*v - ∫ v*du.

Which is (1 - (1/2)t)(3/2 e^(2t/3)) ) - ∫ (3/2 e^(2t/3)) (-1/2) dt.

Simplify:

= (3/2)(1 - t/2) e^(2t/3) + (3/4) ∫ e^(2t/3) dt.

Compute the integral:

(3/4) * (3/2) e^(2t/3) + C.

So the integral is (3/2)(1 - t/2) e^(2t/3) + (9/8) e^(2t/3) + C.

So putting it all together:

y e^(2t/3) = (3/2)(1 - t/2) e^(2t/3) + (9/8) e^(2t/3) + C.

Now, I can factor out e^(2t/3) on the right side:

y e^(2t/3) = e^(2t/3) [ (3/2)(1 - t/2) + 9/8 ] + C.

So divide both sides by e^(2t/3) to get y:

y(t) = (3/2)(1 - t/2) + 9/8 + C e^(-2t/3).

Simplify the terms:

Let me compute (3/2)(1 - t/2):

= 3/2 * 1 - 3/2 * t/2 = 3/2 - (3/4) t.

So adding 9/8:

3/2 is 12/8, so 12/8 + 9/8 = 21/8.

So y(t) = (21/8) - (3/4) t + C e^(-2t/3).

So the general solution is y(t) = 21/8 - (3/4) t + C e^(-2t/3).

Now, apply the initial condition y(0) = y0.

At t=0, y(0) = 21/8 - 0 + C e^0 = 21/8 + C = y0.

So C = y0 - 21/8.

Therefore, the solution is:

y(t) = 21/8 - (3/4) t + (y0 - 21/8) e^(-2t/3).

Now, the problem states that the solution touches but does not cross the t-axis. So the solution must have a point where y(t) = 0 and y'(t) = 0 at that point. Because if it just touches the axis, it's a double root, so both y and its derivative are zero there.

So we need to find t such that y(t) = 0 and y'(t) = 0.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of the solution. Since the solution is y(t) = 21/8 - (3/4) t + (y0 -21/8) e^(-2t/3).

We can set y(t) = 0 and find where it's tangent to the t-axis, so at that point, y(t) = 0 and dy/dt = 0.

So let's compute y'(t):

y'(t) = derivative of 21/8 is 0, derivative of -(3/4)t is -3/4. Then the derivative of the last term is (y0 -21/8) * (-2/3) e^(-2t/3).

So y'(t) = -3/4 + (y0 -21/8)(-2/3) e^(-2t/3).

Wait, let me compute that correctly.

The derivative of (y0 -21/8) e^(-2t/3) is (y0 -21/8) * (-2/3) e^(-2t/3).

So y'(t) = -3/4 + (y0 - 21/8)(-2/3) e^(-2t/3).

Alternatively, it's:

y'(t) = -3/4 - (2/3)(y0 -21/8) e^(-2t/3).

Now, when the solution touches the t-axis, there exists some t = t0 where y(t0) = 0 and y'(t0) = 0.

So we have two equations:

1) 21/8 - (3/4) t0 + (y0 -21/8) e^(-2t0/3) = 0

2) -3/4 - (2/3)(y0 -21/8) e^(-2t0/3) = 0

We can solve these equations to find y0 and t0.

Let me denote A = (y0 -21/8) e^(-2t0/3).

Then equation 1 becomes: 21/8 - (3/4) t0 + A = 0.

Equation 2 becomes: -3/4 - (2/3)(y0 -21/8) e^(-2t0/3) = 0.

Wait, but (y0 -21/8) e^(-2t0/3) is exactly A. So equation 2 is:

-3/4 - (2/3) A = 0.

So from equation 2:

-3/4 - (2/3) A = 0 → (2/3) A = -3/4 → A = (-3/4) * (3/2) = -9/8.

So A = -9/8.

Now, from equation 1:

21/8 - (3/4) t0 + A = 0 → 21/8 - (3/4) t0 -9/8 = 0.

Simplify 21/8 -9/8 = 12/8 = 3/2.

So 3/2 - (3/4) t0 = 0 → (3/4) t0 = 3/2 → t0 = (3/2) / (3/4) = (3/2) * (4/3) )= 2.

So t0 is 2.

Now, since A = (y0 -21/8) e^(-2t0/3) = (y0 -21/8) e^(-4/3).

We found A = -9/8.

So:

(y0 -21/8) e^(-4/3) = -9/8.

Solve for y0:

y0 -21/8 = (-9/8) e^(4/3).

So y0 = 21/8 + (-9/8) e^(4/3).

Compute this value.

First, compute e^(4/3). e is approximately 2.71828. 4/3 is approximately 1.3333.

e^1 is 2.71828, e^0.3333 is about 1.3956 (since e^(1/3) ≈ 1.3956). So e^(4/3) = e * e^(1/3) ≈ 2.71828 * 1.3956 ≈ let's compute that.

2.71828 * 1.3956 ≈ 3.8 (exact value may vary, but let me compute more accurately).

Wait, 2.71828 * 1 = 2.71828.

2.71828 * 0.3956: Let's compute 2.71828 * 0.3 = 0.815484, 2.71828 * 0.0956 ≈ 0.2597.

So total ≈ 0.815484 + 0.2597 ≈ 1.075184.

So total e^(4/3) ≈ 2.71828 + 1.075184 ≈ 3.79346.

So e^(4/3) ≈ 3.7935.

So y0 = 21/8 + (-9/8)(3.7935).

Compute 21/8: 21 divided by 8 is 2.625.

Now, (-9/8)*3.7935: 9/8 is 1.125. So 1.125 * 3.7935 ≈ 4.272375. So with the negative sign, it's -4.272375.

So y0 ≈ 2.625 - 4.272375 = -1.647375.

Looking at the options, option A is -1.642876, option E is -1.73205, option D is -1.41421.

Wait, but my approximate calculation gives about -1.647, which is close to option A (-1.642876) and option E is more negative. So perhaps my approximation is a bit off. Alternatively, maybe I should compute e^(4/3) more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate e^(4/3) more precisely.

Let me compute 4/3 = 1.3333333333.

Calculating e^1.3333333333.

Using a calculator approach:

We can write e^x = 1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + x^4/4! + ... 

But that might take a while. Alternatively, using known values:

We know that e^1 = 2.718281828459045.

e^0.3333333333 is e^(1/3).

e^(1/3) can be calculated as approximately 1.3956124250860895.

So e^(4/3) = e^(1 + 1/3) = e^1 * e^(1/3) ≈ 2.718281828459045 * 1.3956124250860895.

Let me compute that multiplication more accurately.

2.718281828459045 * 1.3956124250860895.

Let me do this step by step.

Compute 2 * 1.3956124250860895 = 2.791224850172179.

0.7 * 1.3956124250860895 = 0.9768284975606624.

0.1 * 1.3956124250860895 = 0.139561242506089.

0.08 * 1.3956124250860895 ≈ 0.111649.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to compute:

2.718281828459045 * 1.3956124250860895.

Let me compute 2.718281828 * 1.395612425.

Breakdown:

= 2 * 1.395612425 = 2.79122485

+ 0.7 * 1.395612425 = 0.9768284975

+ 0.1 * 1.395612425 = 0.1395612425

+ 0.08 * 1.395612425 ≈ 0.111649.

Wait, but that approach is getting messy.

Alternatively, use the fact that 2.718281828 * 1.395612425:

Let me compute 2 * 1.395612425 = 2.79122485.

0.718281828 * 1.395612425:

Compute 0.7 * 1.395612425 = 0.9768284975.

0.018281828 * 1.395612425 ≈ 0.018281828 * 1.3956 ≈ approximately 0.0255.

So adding up: 0.9768284975 + 0.0255 ≈ 1.0023285.

So total is 2.79122485 + 1.0023285 ≈ 3.79355335.

So e^(4/3) ≈ 3.79355335.

So y0 = 21/8 + (-9/8) * 3.79355335.

Compute 21/8 = 2.625.

(-9/8)*3.79355335 = (-1.125) * 3.79355335.

Compute 1.125 * 3.79355335:

1 *
