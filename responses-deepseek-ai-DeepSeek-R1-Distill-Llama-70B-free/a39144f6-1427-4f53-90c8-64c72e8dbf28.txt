Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit new to this kind of math, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says a machinist worked for 23 and a half hours. I need to calculate the cost of his labor if he's paid $3.90 per hour. Hmm, right, so it's a multiplication problem, but I have to make sure I handle the mixed number correctly.

First, I should probably convert that mixed number into a decimal or an improper fraction to make the multiplication easier. Wait, 23 and a half hours is the same as 23.5 hours, right? Because 1/2 an hour is 0.5 hours. So 23 + 0.5 equals 23.5 hours.

Now, the pay rate is $3.90 per hour. So to find the total cost, I multiply the number of hours by the hourly rate. That makes sense. So I need to calculate 23.5 multiplied by 3.90.

Let me think about how to do this multiplication. Maybe breaking it down would help. 23.5 is the same as 20 + 3.5. So I can split the multiplication into two parts: 20 * 3.90 and 3.5 * 3.90, then add them together.

Calculating 20 * 3.90 first. Well, 20 times 3 is 60, and 20 times 0.90 is 18. So 60 + 18 equals 78. So that part is $78.

Next, 3.5 multiplied by 3.90. Hmm, 3 times 3.90 is 11.70, and 0.5 times 3.90 is 1.95. Adding those together gives 11.70 + 1.95 = 13.65.

Now I add the two results: 78 plus 13.65. Let's see, 78 + 13 is 91, and then add the 0.65, so 91.65. So the total cost should be $91.65.

Looking at the options provided, option D is $91.65. So that's the answer. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, I could multiply 23.5 by 3.90 directly. Let me write it out:

23.5
x 3.90
--------
First, multiply 23.5 by 0.90. Hmm, 23.5 * 0.9. Let's see, 23 * 0.9 is 20.7, and 0.5 * 0.9 is 0.45. So 20.7 + 0.45 is 21.15.

Then, multiply 23.5 by 3.00, which is 70.50.

Adding 70.50 and 21.15 gives 91.65. Yep, same result. So I think I did it right.

Wait, maybe another way to check. Let's use another method. 3.90 is the same as 3.9 dollars. So 23.5 * 3.9.

I can think of 3.9 as 4 - 0.1. So 23.5 * 4 is 94, and 23.5 * 0.1 is 2.35. Subtracting 2.35 from 94 gives 91.65. Same answer again. So I must be correct.

So the correct option is D, $91.65.

The machinist worked for 23.5 hours at a rate of $3.90 per hour. To calculate the total labor cost:

1. Convert the mixed number 23(1/2) hours to a decimal: 23.5 hours.
2. Multiply the total hours by the hourly rate:  
   \[
   23.5 \times 3.90 = 91.65
   \]
3. Verify the calculation using alternative methods to ensure accuracy.

The total cost of labor is **$91.65**.
