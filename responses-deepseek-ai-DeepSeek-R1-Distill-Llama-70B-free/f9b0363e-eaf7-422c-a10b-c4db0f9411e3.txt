Okay, so I've got this motor problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on DC motors, but I'll try to remember the key concepts.

Alright, the motor is a 230-volt DC motor. The armature circuit resistance is 0.3 ohms. It runs at 1200 rpm with normal excitation and an armature current of 50 amps. 

The problem has two main parts. Part (i) asks about what happens when the load changes, and part (ii) is about starting the motor with and without auxiliary resistance. Let's tackle part (i) first.

Part (i)(a): The load increases, armature current rises to 60 A. What's the new speed?

Hmm, I remember that in a DC motor, speed depends on the armature current because of the induced voltage. The formula I think is V = Ia(Ra + Rsh) + (PφZ)/(6N) * Ia², but wait, that might be for something else. Oh wait, no, the speed equation for a DC motor is n = (V - IaRa) / (Kφ), where K is some constant. Or maybe it's better to think in terms of the back EMF. Right, back EMF E = V - IaRa. Since the speed is proportional to E, because E = Kφn, so n is proportional to E.

Wait, let me think again. The speed equation for a DC motor is n = (V - IaRa) / (K), where K is dependent on flux and other constants. So when the armature current changes, the back EMF changes, which changes the speed. 

So, initially, at 50 A, the back EMF E1 = V - Ia*Ra = 230 - 50*0.3 = 230 - 15 = 215 V.

The speed n1 is 1200 rpm, which is proportional to E1. So n = E/(Kφ), but flux φ is constant since excitation is normal (so same flux). So E is proportional to speed.

When the current increases to 60 A, E2 = 230 - 60*0.3 = 230 - 18 = 212 V. So E has decreased, meaning speed will decrease.

The initial speed was 1200 rpm at E1=215 V. So new speed n2 = (E2/E1) * n1. So n2 = (212/215)*1200. Let me calculate that.

212 divided by 215. Let's see, 215 is 212 +3, so 212/215 ≈ 0.986. So 0.986 * 1200 ≈ 1183 rpm. Wait, but looking at the options, that's one of the numbers I see. Let me check.

Wait, part (i) has (a) and (b), so part (i)(a) would be n2, part (i)(b) is n3 when Ia is 25 A. Let's do part (i)(a) first.

Wait, let me compute 212/215 exactly. 212/215 = (215-3)/215 = 1 - 3/215 ≈ 0.9860465. Multiply by 1200: 0.9860465 * 1200 ≈ around 1183.2 rpm. So approximately 1183 rpm. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options, looking for part (i)(a) and (b) speeds. Let's see option I: S2=1183 rpm, S3=1242 rpm. That fits. So part (i)(a) is 1183 rpm, and part (i)(b) is when Ia is 25 A.

Now part (i)(b): Load is reduced, Ia drops to 25 A. So E3 = 230 - 25 * 0.3 = 230 -7.5 = 222.5 V.

So E3 is higher than E1 (215). So speed n3 = (222.5/215)*1200. Let's calculate that.

222.5 / 215 = approx 1.035. 1.035 *1200 = 1242 rpm. So part (i)(b) is 1242 rpm. So looking at option I, part (i)(a) and (b) match.

So that's part (i) done. Now part (ii):

Part (ii)(a): Starting the motor without auxiliary resistance. What's the current at the moment of starting?

Starting current Ia_start is V / Ra. Because when the motor is starting, speed is zero, so back EMF E is zero. So Ia = V / Ra. V is 230 V, Ra is 0.3 ohms. So Ia = 230 / 0.3 = 766.666... ≈ 766.67 A. So looking for an option where I_a is approximately 766.67 A. Let's see the options.

Option I says I_a=766 (2/3) amp, which is 766.666... So that's correct. Other options have 765, 766, 767, etc. So option I fits.

Part (ii)(b): What series resistance should be inserted so that starting current is limited to 1.5 times the normal current. Normal current is 50 A, so 1.5 *50 =75 A.

So starting current I_start = 75 A. The formula is I_start = V / (R_total), where R_total is Ra + R_s (series resistance).

So 75 = 230 / (0.3 + R_s). Let's solve for R_s.

0.3 + R_s = 230 /75 → 230/75 ≈3.0667 ohms. So R_s =3.0667 -0.3 = 2.7667 ohms. Approximately 2.7667, which is about 2.77 ohms. Looking at option I, R_s is 2.77 ohms. That's spot on.

So all the parts point to option I being correct.

The problem involves analyzing the behavior of a 230-volt DC motor with an armature resistance of 0.3 ohms under varying conditions. The motor operates at 1200 rpm with normal excitation and an armature current of 50 A. The analysis is divided into two parts:

### Part (i)
**(a)** When the load increases and the armature current rises to 60 A, the back EMF decreases due to the higher voltage drop across the armature resistance. The new back EMF is calculated as:

\[
E_2 = V - I_a R_a = 230 - 60 \times 0.3 = 212 \, \text{V}.
\]

Since speed is proportional to back EMF, the new speed is:

\[
n_2 = \frac{E_2}{E_1} \cdot n_1 = \frac{212}{215} \cdot 1200 \approx 1183 \, \text{rpm}.
\]

**(b)** When the load decreases and the armature current drops to 25 A, the back EMF increases:

\[
E_3 = V - I_a R_a = 230 - 25 \times 0.3 = 222.5 \, \text{V}.
\]

The new speed is:

\[
n_3 = \frac{E_3}{E_1} \cdot n_1 = \frac{222.5}{215} \cdot 1200 \approx 1242 \, \text{rpm}.
\]

### Part (ii)
**(a)** When the motor is started without auxiliary resistance, the starting current is:

\[
I_{\text{start}} = \frac{V}{R_a} = \frac{230}{0.3} \approx 766.67 \, \text{A}.
\]

**(b)** To limit the starting current to 1.5 times the normal current (75 A), the total resistance in the circuit must be:

\[
R_{\text{total}} = \frac{V}{I_{\text{start}}} = \frac{230}{75} \approx 3.067 \, \Omega.
\]

The series resistance to be added is:

\[
R_s = R_{\text{total}} - R_a = 3.067 - 0.3 \approx 2.77 \, \Omega.
\]

### Conclusion
The calculations for part (i) yield speeds of approximately 1183 rpm and 1242 rpm for the two cases, and the calculations for part (ii) yield a starting current of 766.67 A and a required series resistance of 2.77 ohms. These values match the data in **Option I**.
