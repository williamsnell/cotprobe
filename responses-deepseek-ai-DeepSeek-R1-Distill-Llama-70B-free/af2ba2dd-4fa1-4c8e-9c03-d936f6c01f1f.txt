Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the tax on a store. Hmm, let's see. The store's assessed valuation is $6,640. The tax rate is $3.87 per $100, and there's an additional 2% collector's fee. I need to find the total tax including that fee.

Alright, first step is to calculate the base tax. The tax rate is $3.87 for every $100 of assessed value. So I think I need to find out how many hundreds are in $6,640. Let me divide 6,640 by 100. Oh wait, that's 66.4. So each $100 contributes $3.87, so 66.4 times 3.87.

Wait, let me do the math. 66 times 3.87 plus 0.4 times 3.87. 66 * 3.87 is... Let's see, 60*3.87 is 232.2, and 6*3.87 is 23.22, so total is 232.2 +23.22=255.42. Then 0.4 *3.87 is 1.548. So adding that to 255.42 gives 256.968. Let me write that as approximately $256.97 for the base tax.

Now, there's a collector's fee which is 2% of the tax. So I need to calculate 2% of $256.97. 2% is 0.02, so 256.97 * 0.02. Let's compute that. 256 *0.02 is 5.12. 0.97*0.02 is 0.0194. So total is 5.12 + 0.0194 = 5.1394. So approximately $5.14 as the collector's fee.

Now add the base tax and the fee. $256.97 + $5.14 equals $262.11. Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another approach: Maybe I should calculate the tax first more accurately. 6,640 divided by 100 is 66.4. Multiply by 3.87. Let's do it step by step.

66.4 *3.87. Let's break it down:

3.87 * 66 = ?

3.87 *60 = 232.2

3.87 *6 = 23.22

So 232.2 +23.22=255.42

Then 3.87 *0.4 = 1.548

So total tax is 255.42 +1.548=256.968, which is $256.97 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Then, 2% of 256.97 is (256.97 * 2)/100 =5.1394, which is $5.14.

Total tax with fee: 256.97 +5.14=262.11.

Looking at the options, option D is $262.11, so the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option D is $262.11, yes. So that's the correct answer.

To calculate the total tax on the store, we start by determining the base tax. The tax rate is $3.87 per $100 of assessed valuation. The assessed valuation is $6,640, which is 66.4 times $100. 

The base tax is calculated as:
\[
66.4 \times 3.87 = 256.968 \, \text{(rounded to \$256.97)}.
\]

Next, we add the 2% collector's fee. The fee is calculated as:
\[
0.02 \times 256.97 = 5.1394 \, \text{(rounded to \$5.14)}.
\]

Adding the base tax and the collector's fee gives:
\[
256.97 + 5.14 = 262.11.
\]

Thus, the total tax, including the collector's fee, is **$262.11**.

The correct answer is:

D: $262.11
