Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the index of refraction for a glass with a given dielectric constant. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, I remember that the index of refraction (n) is related to the dielectric constant (ε_r), but I'm not exactly sure of the exact relationship. Wait, wasn't there a formula that connects these two? Oh right, I think it's something like n equals the square root of the dielectric constant. So n = sqrt(ε_r). Does that sound right?

Let me double-check. The dielectric constant ε_r is also known as the relative permittivity. It's the ratio of the permittivity of the material to the vacuum permittivity. And the index of refraction is related to how much light slows down in a medium. So when light enters a medium, its speed decreases by a factor of n. But how does that tie into the dielectric constant?

Oh, right! In non-magnetic materials, which glass probably is, the dielectric constant is approximately equal to the square of the refractive index. So ε_r ≈ n². That makes sense because the refractive index depends on the material's response to the electric field of the light wave. 

So if ε_r is 2.5, then n would be the square root of 2.5. Let me calculate that. The square root of 2.5 is approximately... Well, sqrt(2) is about 1.414, and sqrt(2.25) is 1.5 because 1.5 squared is 2.25. So 2.5 is a bit more than 2.25. Let me compute it more accurately.

2.5 is equal to 5/2. The square root of 5 is approximately 2.236, so sqrt(5/2) would be (sqrt(5))/sqrt(2) ≈ 2.236 / 1.414 ≈ 1.581. Oh wait, that's about 1.58. So the index of refraction is around 1.58.

Looking at the options, let's see: option F is 1.58. So that must be the correct choice.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing anything up. Are there any exceptions or other factors I'm forgetting? For example, does this relationship hold for all frequencies or is it only an approximation? I think for visible light and non-magnetic materials, this relation holds pretty well. So glass, being a non-conductive material, should fit this.

So yeah, I think I'm confident. The answer is F, 1.58.

The index of refraction \( n \) for a non-magnetic material is approximately the square root of its dielectric constant \( \varepsilon_r \), i.e., \( n = \sqrt{\varepsilon_r} \). Given \( \varepsilon_r = 2.5 \), we calculate:

\[
n = \sqrt{2.5} \approx 1.58
\]

Among the provided options, the closest value to 1.58 is option F. This relationship holds well for non-magnetic materials like glass under visible light conditions.

Answer: F
