Okay, so I've got this equation to solve for x. Let me read it again carefully. The problem is:

√x divided by (x√3 + √2) equals 1 divided by (2x√6 +4). So, in equation form, that's (√x)/(x√3 + √2) = 1/(2x√6 +4).

Alright, I need to solve for x. Hmm, where to start. Maybe cross-multiplying would help? Yeah, that makes sense because it's a proportion.

So if I cross-multiply, I get √x * (2x√6 +4) equals (x√3 +√2) * 1. Simplifying both sides.

Let me write that out:

√x * (2x√6 +4) = x√3 +√2.

Hmm, let's expand the left side. Distribute √x into the terms inside the parentheses.

So, √x * 2x√6 would be 2x√6 * √x. And √x *4 is 4√x.

Wait, let me compute each term. So 2x√6 times √x is 2x√6 * √x. Since √x is x^(1/2), multiplying by x gives x^(3/2). And √6 is a constant. So 2x√6 * √x = 2 x^(3/2) √6.

Similarly, 4√x is just 4x^(1/2).

So the left side becomes 2√6 x^(3/2) +4x^(1/2).

The right side is x√3 +√2.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated because of the different exponents of x. Maybe I can factor out √x from the left side.

Wait, let's see:

Left side: 2√6 x^(3/2) +4x^(1/2) = √x (2√6 x +4).

So the equation becomes √x (2√6 x +4) = x√3 +√2.

Hmm, perhaps I can divide both sides by √x? But wait, that would require x not being zero, but I think that's safe because if x were zero, the left side denominator would involve division by zero as well, so x can't be zero. So dividing both sides by √x is acceptable.

So dividing both sides by √x:

2√6 x +4 = (x√3 +√2)/√x.

Wait, let me make sure. Dividing each term on the left by √x:

(2√6 x^(3/2))/(√x) = 2√6 x.

And (4√x)/(√x)=4.

So yes, left side becomes 2√6 x +4.

On the right side, (x√3 +√2)/√x. Let me split that into two terms:

x√3 /√x + √2/√x.

Simplify each term. x/√x is x^(1) / x^(1/2) = x^(1/2) = √x.

So first term: √x *√3 = √(3x).

Second term: √2 / √x = √(2/x) = √2 * x^(-1/2).

So the right side becomes √(3x) + √(2/x).

So putting it all together, the equation is:

2√6 x +4 = √(3x) + √(2/x).

Hmm, this still looks tricky. Maybe a substitution would help. Let me let t = √x. Then x = t^2, and √x = t.

Substituting into the equation:

2√6 (t^2) +4 = √(3 t^2) + √(2/t^2).

Simplify each term.

√(3 t^2) is t√3, since t is positive (since it's a square root).

Similarly, √(2/t^2) is (√2)/t.

So the equation becomes:

2√6 t² +4 = t√3 + (√2)/t.

Hmm, maybe multiply both sides by t to eliminate the denominator. Let's try that.

Multiply each term by t:

2√6 t^3 +4t = t^2 √3 + √2.

So now we have:

2√6 t^3 +4t - √3 t^2 -√2 =0.

This is a cubic equation in t. Solving cubic equations can be a bit involved, but perhaps we can find a rational root or factor it somehow.

Let me try to rearrange the terms:

2√6 t³ - √3 t² +4t -√2 =0.

Looking for possible factors. Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution that can make this equation look simpler. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor by grouping. Let's see:

Group terms as (2√6 t³ - √3 t²) + (4t -√2).

Factor out t² from the first group: t² (2√6 t - √3) + (4t -√2).

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let me compute 2√6 t -√3. Maybe factor √3 out.

Wait, √6 is √2 *√3. So 2√6 is 2√2√3.

So 2√6 t -√3 = √3 (2√2 t -1).

So the first group becomes t² *√3 (2√2 t -1).

The second group is 4t -√2. Let me see if I can factor something here. Hmm, 4t is 2√2 t * something? Wait, 4t = 2√2 t * (√2 * 2 / √2) ? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps 4t -√2 can be expressed in terms of (2√2 t -1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's see, 4t -√2. If I factor out √2, that would be √2 ( (4/√2) t -1 ). 4/√2 is 2√2, so √2 (2√2 t -1 ) = 4t -√2.

Ah, yes! So 4t -√2 = √2 (2√2 t -1).

So substituting back, the equation becomes:

√3 t² (2√2 t -1) + √2 (2√2 t -1 )=0.

Now, notice that both terms have a common factor of (2√2 t -1). So factor that out:

(2√2 t -1)(√3 t² + √2 ) =0.

So the product equals zero, so either factor is zero.

Case 1: 2√2 t -1 =0 → 2√2 t =1 → t=1/(2√2).

Case 2: √3 t² +√2=0. But since √3 and √2 are positive, and t² is non-negative, this sum can't be zero. So only Case 1 is valid.

So t =1/(2√2).

But t was our substitution for √x. So √x=1/(2√2). Then x= [1/(2√2)]².

Compute that: 1/( (2√2)^2 ) = 1/(4 *2 )=1/8.

So x=1/8.

Let me check the options. Option D is 1/8. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check by plugging back into the original equation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Original equation: √x / (x√3 +√2 ) = 1/(2x√6 +4).

Compute each side with x=1/8.

Left side numerator: √(1/8) = 1/(2√2).

Denominator: ( (1/8)√3 ) + √2 = √3/(8) + √2.

Right side denominator: 2*(1/8)*√6 +4 = ( √6 )/4 +4.

Compute left side: [1/(2√2)] / [√3/8 + √2 ].

Let me rationalize denominators or compute numerically to check.

Alternatively, let's compute each side.

Left side denominator: √3/(8) + √2 ≈ (1.732)/(8) + 2.828 ≈ 0.2165 + 2.828 ≈ 3.0445.

So numerator is 1/(2√2) ≈ 1/(2.828) ≈ 0.3536.

So left side ≈ 0.3536 /3.0445 ≈ 0.116.

Right side denominator: √6/4 +4 ≈ 2.449/4 +4 ≈ 0.612 +4 =4.612.

So 1/(4.612) ≈ 0.2168.

Wait, that doesn't seem to match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, that's confusing. If x=1/8, then according to substitution, it's a solution, but when I plug in, the left side is around 0.116 and the right side is 0.2168. So they don't match. That suggests I made a mistake.

Hmm, maybe I messed up in the substitution or the algebra steps.

Wait, let me re-examine my steps.

So starting again, the equation after cross-multiplying was:

√x (2x√6 +4) = x√3 +√2.

Then I divided both sides by √x, getting:

2√6 x +4 = (x√3)/√x + √2/√x.

Which simplifies to:

2√6 x +4 = √(3x) + √(2/x).

Then I let t=√x, so x=t², and substituted:

2√6 t² +4 = t√3 + (√2)/t.

Then multiplied both sides by t:

2√6 t³ +4t = t²√3 +√2.

Then rearranged:

2√6 t³ -√3 t² +4t -√2 =0.

Then I tried factoring. Let me double-check that.

I grouped terms as (2√6 t³ -√3 t²) and (4t -√2).

Factoring t² from the first group: t²(2√6 t -√3 ). From the second group, I tried to find a common factor.

Wait, 4t -√2 can be written as √2 ( (4/√2) t -1 ), which is √2 (2√2 t -1 ), correct. Because 4/√2 is 2√2.

So then, both groups have a factor of (2√2 t -1 ). So factoring that out:

(2√2 t -1)(√3 t² +√2 )=0.

So either 2√2 t -1=0 → t=1/(2√2), or √3 t² +√2=0, which is impossible. So t=1/(2√2).

So x= t²=1/(8).

Wait, but when I plug x=1/8 into the original equation, the left and right sides don't match. So I must have made a mistake in the substitution or the algebra.

Wait, let me recompute the substitution steps. Let's go back to when I had:

√x (2x√6 +4) = x√3 +√2.

Wait, perhaps I should have kept the equation as 2√6 x^(3/2) +4√x = x√3 +√2.

Alternatively, perhaps another substitution would work better. Let me try a substitution where u = √x. So x= u².

Then the equation becomes:

u/(u²√3 +√2 ) = 1/(2 u²√6 +4).

Cross-multiplying: u*(2 u²√6 +4) = u²√3 +√2.

Expanding left side: 2√6 u^3 +4u.

So equation is 2√6 u^3 +4u = u²√3 +√2.

Rearranged: 2√6 u^3 -√3 u² +4u -√2=0.

Hmm, same as before. So perhaps I made an error in substitution elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the mistake is in the initial cross-multiplication step. Let me recheck that.

Original equation: (√x)/(x√3 +√2) =1/(2x√6 +4).

Cross-multiplying gives √x*(2x√6 +4) = (x√3 +√2)*1.

Yes, that's correct.

Expanding: √x*(2x√6) +√x*4 = x√3 +√2.

Which is 2√6 x^(3/2) +4√x =x√3 +√2.

So that's correct.

Hmm, maybe I should try a different approach. Let me square both sides of the original equation to eliminate the square roots. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can express denominators in terms of √x.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let y=√x, so x = y². Then the equation becomes:

y/(y²√3 +√2 ) =1/(2 y²√6 +4).

Cross-multiplying: y*(2 y²√6 +4) = y²√3 +√2.

Which is the same as before. So same result.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake when I plugged in x=1/8. Let me recompute that.

Left side: √x / (x√3 +√2).

x=1/8, so √x=1/(2√2).

Denominator: (1/8)√3 +√2.

Compute denominator numerically:

(1/8)*1.732 ≈ 0.2165.

√2≈1.4142.

So denominator ≈0.2165 +1.4142≈1.6307.

Numerator: 1/(2√2)≈0.35355.

So left side ≈0.35355 /1.6307≈0.2168.

Right side:1/(2x√6 +4).

x=1/8, so 2*(1/8)=1/4.

√6≈2.4495.

So 2x√6= (1/4)*2.4495≈0.6124.

Adding 4: 0.6124 +4=4.6124.

So 1/4.6124≈0.2168.

Ah, so both sides are approximately 0.2168. So they do match. So x=1/8 is correct.

Earlier, I must have miscalculated the denominator when I thought it didn't match.

So the correct answer is D: 1/8.
</think>

To solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{x}}{x\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2x\sqrt{6} + 4},
\]

we start by cross-multiplying to eliminate the denominators:

\[
\sqrt{x} \cdot (2x\sqrt{6} + 4) = (x\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}) \cdot 1.
\]

Expanding both sides:

\[
2\sqrt{6} \cdot x^{3/2} + 4\sqrt{x} = x\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}.
\]

To simplify, let \( t = \sqrt{x} \), so \( x = t^2 \) and \( \sqrt{x} = t \). Substituting these into the equation gives:

\[
2\sqrt{6} \cdot t^3 + 4t = t^2\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
2\sqrt{6}t^3 - \sqrt{3}t^2 + 4t - \sqrt{2} = 0.
\]

Next, we factor by grouping. Group the terms as:

\[
(2\sqrt{6}t^3 - \sqrt{3}t^2) + (4t - \sqrt{2}).
\]

From the first group, factor out \( t^2 \):

\[
t^2(2\sqrt{6}t - \sqrt{3}).
\]

From the second group, factor out \( \sqrt{2} \):

\[
\sqrt{2}(2\sqrt{2}t - 1).
\]

Now, notice that \( 2\sqrt{6}t - \sqrt{3} \) can be rewritten as \( \sqrt{3}(2\sqrt{2}t - 1) \). Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
\sqrt{3}t^2(2\sqrt{2}t - 1) + \sqrt{2}(2\sqrt{2}t - 1) = 0.
\]

Factor out the common term \( (2\sqrt{2}t - 1) \):

\[
(2\sqrt{2}t - 1)(\sqrt{3}t^2 + \sqrt{2}) = 0.
\]

Since \( \sqrt{3}t^2 + \sqrt{2} > 0 \) for all real \( t \), the only solution comes from:

\[
2\sqrt{2}t - 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Recall that \( t = \sqrt{x} \), so:

\[
\sqrt{x} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \left(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{8}.
\]

Finally, verify the solution by substituting \( x = \frac{1}{8} \) back into the original equation. Both sides simplify to approximately \( 0.2168 \), confirming that the solution is correct.

Thus, the answer is:

**D: \(\frac{1}{8}\)**
