Okay, so I have this economics question here about Alfred Marshall's contribution to the debate between classical economists and early marginalists. Hmm, I remember that classical economists like Adam Smith and David Ricardo focused a lot on the cost of production as the main determinant of price. They believed that the price of a good is mainly based on how much it costs to produce it, including labor and materials.

Then there were the marginalists, like Carl Menger and William Stanley Jevons, who came along later. They argued that demand plays a crucial role in determining price. So they shifted the focus towards the utility or marginal benefit that consumers get from a product. The idea was that the price isn't just about production costs but also about how much people want or need the product.

Now, the question is about Alfred Marshall. I think he tried to bring these two views together. Marshall is known for his work in economics, especially his book "Principles of Economics." I remember something about supply and demand curves from him. Oh right, he's the one who popularized the supply and demand diagram where the equilibrium price is where the two curves intersect.

So, Marshall's contribution was probably to synthesize both the cost of production (supply side) and consumer demand (demand side) into a single theory. He showed that price isn't determined by just one factor but by both supply and demand interacting in the market. This would mean that neither the classical view nor the marginalist view alone was complete; instead, both are necessary to understand how prices are determined.

Looking at the options, option D says, "Marshall synthesized the views of earlier writers into a new theory of price." That sounds right. The other options don't fit as well. Option E says he introduced the concept of supply, but I think supply was already part of classical economics, so that's not his main contribution. Option F is about focusing solely on demand, which was the marginalist view, not Marshall's. Option A says he disregarded time, which doesn't make sense because Marshall actually considered time factors in his analysis, like short-run vs. long-run.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D.

Alfred Marshall's contribution was to integrate the classical economists' focus on production costs (supply) with the marginalists' emphasis on demand. He developed the supply and demand framework, illustrating how prices result from their intersection. This synthesis is best captured by option D.
