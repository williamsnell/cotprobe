Okay, so I've got this question about JK flip-flops and their modes. Hmm, I remember that flip-flops are basic memory elements in digital electronics, right? They can store a bit of information. The JK flip-flop is one type, and I think it's named after its inventor, Jack Kilby, but I'm not totally sure about that.

The question is asking about the toggle mode of a JK flip-flop. Wait, toggle mode... I think that's when the flip-flop changes its state every time the clock signal is applied. Like, it alternates between 0 and 1 each clock cycle. So, in toggle mode, the output complements its previous state.

Now, the options given are A through D, each with different J and K input values. I need to remember how the JK flip-flop behaves based on the inputs. I recall that the JK flip-flop has a truth table. Let me try to recall it.

When J=0 and K=0, I think the flip-flop doesn't change its state. It stays the same; so it's in the hold mode. So that's option A, which is J=0, K=0.

When J=1 and K=1, that's where the toggle mode comes in. Oh right, because if both J and K are high, the flip-flop toggles its output on each clock pulse. So that would be option B: J=1, K=1.

Other options: C is J=0, K=1. I think that's the reset condition. Because if K is 1, it might act like a reset, setting the output to 0 regardless of J. Or wait, maybe that's when K is 1 and J is 0, the flip-flop gets reset. Or perhaps that's the clear condition. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with the SR flip-flop. I should be careful.

Option D is J=1, K=0. I think that's the set condition. When J is 1 and K is 0, the flip-flop sets the output to 1, regardless of the current state. So that's the set mode.

So the question is about the toggle mode, which is when J and K are both 1. So the correct answer should be option B. Let me double-check. In the JK flip-flop, when both inputs are high, the output toggles on each clock edge. Yes, that's right. So option B is J=1, K=1.

In the toggle mode of a JK flip-flop, the flip-flop changes its state with each clock pulse, alternating between 0 and 1. This occurs when both the J and K inputs are set to 1. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A (J=0, K=0):** This is the hold mode, where the flip-flop retains its current state.
- **B (J=1, K=1):** This is the toggle mode, where the flip-flop alternates its state on each clock pulse.
- **C (J=0, K=1):** This is the reset mode, where the flip-flop is reset to 0.
- **D (J=1, K=0):** This is the set mode, where the flip-flop is set to 1.

The correct answer for the toggle mode is **B (J=1, K=1)**.

Answer: B
