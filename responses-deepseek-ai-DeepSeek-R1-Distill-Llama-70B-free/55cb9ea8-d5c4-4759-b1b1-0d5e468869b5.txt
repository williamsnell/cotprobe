Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the marginal propensity to consume and the break-even point. Hmm, I remember these terms from my studies, but I need to think carefully.

Alright, so the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is given as 1/2. I think MPC is the fraction of additional income that a household consumes rather than saves. So if you get an extra dollar, you spend half of it and save the other half. Right, so MPC = 1/2 here.

The break-even point is $8,000. Wait, what's the break-even point again? Oh right, I think that's the level of income where consumption equals income, meaning that savings are zero at that point. So when income is exactly $8,000, people spend all of it, and nothing is saved. Or wait, noâ€”wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again. The break-even point is where the household's income is just enough to cover their consumption without any savings. So if income is below that, they might have to dissave (use past savings) to cover expenses. But when income is exactly at the break-even point, savings are zero.

So the problem states that income is $10,000, which is higher than the break-even point of $8,000. So at $10,000 income, they will consume some amount and save the rest.

Now the question is, how much will be consumed and how much saved. The options are A to J.

I think the formula for consumption is C = MPC*(Y - B), where Y is income and B is the break-even point. Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Or perhaps the consumption function is C = MPC*Y + (1 - MPC)*B. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the standard consumption function is C = a + MPC*Y, where a is autonomous consumption. But I'm trying to relate this to the break-even point.

Alternatively, another approach. At the break-even point, Y = B, so savings S = Y - C = 0. So C = Y at Y=B. So if income is B, consumption is B. So when Y = B, C = B.

But in the standard setup, the consumption function is C = a + MPC*Y. So when Y = B, C = B. So substituting, B = a + MPC*B. Solving for a, we get a = B - MPC*B = B*(1 - MPC). So a = 8000*(1 - 1/2) = 8000*(1/2) = $4,000.

So the consumption function is C = 4000 + (1/2)*Y.

Now, when Y is $10,000, let's compute C. So C = 4000 + 0.5*10,000. 0.5*10k is 5k, plus 4k is 9k. So consumption is $9,000. Then savings S = Y - C = 10,000 - 9,000 = $1,000.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way: The break-even point is $8,000. So when Y = 8,000, C = 8,000 and S = 0. When Y increases beyond 8,000, each additional dollar is split with MPC 1/2. So for each dollar above 8k, 50 cents is consumed, 50 saved.

So income is 10k, which is 2k above break-even. So the extra 2k would have savings of 2k * (1 - MPC) = 2k*(1/2) = 1k. So total savings is 1k, consumption is 8k (break-even) + 2k*(1/2) = 8k + 1k = 9k. So yes, same result.

Looking at the options, option F says consumption is $9,000 and $1,000 saved. That matches.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Let me recast the problem using the formula.

The standard formula is C = a + bY, where b is MPC. At Y = B, C = B. So substituting, B = a + b*B. Solving for a: a = B(1 - b).

So a = 8000*(1 - 0.5) = 4000. So C = 4000 + 0.5 Y.

At Y=10,000, C=4000 + 5000=9000. S=Y-C=1000. So yes, F is correct.

Looking at the options, option F is consumption $9,000 and save $1,000. So the answer should be F.

To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given values:

1. **Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)** = 1/2. This means that for every additional dollar of income, 50 cents is consumed, and 50 cents is saved.
2. **Break-even point (B)** = $8,000. At this income level, consumption equals income, and savings are zero.
3. **Income (Y)** = $10,000. This is the current income level, which is $2,000 above the break-even point.

The consumption function can be expressed as:

\[
C = a + \text{MPC} \cdot Y
\]

At the break-even point, \( Y = B \), and \( C = B \). Substituting these values into the equation:

\[
B = a + \text{MPC} \cdot B
\]

Solving for \( a \) (autonomous consumption):

\[
a = B \cdot (1 - \text{MPC})
\]

Substituting \( B = 8,000 \) and \( \text{MPC} = 1/2 \):

\[
a = 8,000 \cdot (1 - 1/2) = 8,000 \cdot 1/2 = 4,000
\]

Thus, the consumption function becomes:

\[
C = 4,000 + 0.5 \cdot Y
\]

Now, substituting \( Y = 10,000 \):

\[
C = 4,000 + 0.5 \cdot 10,000 = 4,000 + 5,000 = 9,000
\]

Savings (\( S \)) is calculated as:

\[
S = Y - C = 10,000 - 9,000 = 1,000
\]

Thus, at an income of $10,000, consumption is $9,000, and savings are $1,000.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**F: Consumption is $9,000 and $1,000 is saved.**
