Question:

A pharmacist was employed by a drug store. A long-time customer of the drug store presented a prescription to the pharmacist for the medication Clinoril, which was prescribed by her physician to treat her arthritic condition. The pharmacist was in a rush that day because of a backlog of prescriptions to fill, and he misread the customer's prescription. He filled her prescription with Clinitest, a caustic substance not for internal use. He labeled the container with the instructions for Clinoril: "Take one tablet twice a day. "The customer followed the instructions, consumed the Clinitest, and suffered severe injuries to her stomach and esophagus. If the customer brings a strict liability in tort action against the pharmacist, what is his best defense?

Options:

A: The customer did not suffer any injuries due to the medication.
B: The customer did not ask for clarification about the medication.
C: The physician had prescribed the wrong medication.
D: The drug store was not the manufacturer upon whom ultimate liability falls.
E: The medication was properly labeled with the correct medication name.
F: It was the cashier and not he who personally received the money for the medication.
G: The customer should have been aware that the medication was not correct.
H: He was not a seller of the product upon whom strict liability may be imposed.
I: He exercised reasonable care under the circumstances.
J: The customer misread the label on the medication.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about a pharmacist and a customer. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit new to tort law, especially strict liability, so I'll need to think carefully.

The scenario is that a pharmacist misfilled a prescription. The customer had a prescription for Clinoril, which is for arthritis. But the pharmacist was rushed and filled it with Clinitest instead. Clinitest is a caustic substance, not meant to be taken internally. He labeled it correctly as Clinoril with the dosage instructions. The customer took it and got hurt.

The question is about a strict liability in tort action against the pharmacist. So, what's the best defense for the pharmacist?

I remember that strict liability applies in certain situations, like product liability. Typically, strict liability applies to manufacturers or sellers of products. So, if the pharmacist is the seller, he might be liable. But wait, maybe there's an exception.

Let me think about the defenses in strict liability. One common defense is that the product wasn't defective or that the plaintiff was using it in an abnormal way. But in this case, the product was definitely defective because it was the wrong one. So that's not it.

Another point is whether the pharmacist is a "seller" under the strict liability theory. Pharmacists usually are considered sellers because they sell the medication. So option H says he wasn't a seller. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe if he's an employee, the employer (drug store) is the seller, but the pharmacist himself might still fall under that category.

Wait, but let me think again. In some jurisdictions, pharmacists are considered learned professionals and might not be strictly liable for product defects because they're not in the business of manufacturing or selling. But more often, they are part of the chain of distribution. So maybe option H isn't the right defense.

Another option is assumption of risk. If the customer should have known something was wrong, like the medication looked different or the name was wrong. But the pharmacist labeled it as Clinoril, so the customer wouldn't know. So option G says the customer should have been aware, but that doesn't seem applicable here.

What about the pharmacist's exercise of reasonable care? Strict liability doesn't require negligence; it's about the product being defective. So even if he was careful, if the product is defective, he could still be liable. But wait, maybe if it's a strict liability case, the defenses are different. Oh, I think in strict product liability, a defense could be that the product wasn't unreasonably dangerous when used as intended. But here, the product was Clinitest, which isn't meant to be taken internally, so using it as per the label (which said take orally) made it dangerous. So that doesn't help.

Another angle: the pharmacist could argue that the customer's injury wasn't caused by the product's defect but by something else. But the facts say she consumed Clinitest, which caused injury, so that's not it.

Option I says he exercised reasonable care. But in strict liability, it's not about care; it's about the product being defective. So even if he was careful, that's not a defense. Unless... wait, in some cases, like if the error was in the prescription itself, maybe the pharmacist isn't liable if he's following a doctor's order. But that's more about negligence, not strict liability.

Wait, the customer is suing under strict liability. So, the elements are: (1) defendant was a seller or manufacturer, (2) product had a defect that made it unreasonably dangerous, (3) defect caused the injury, (4) plaintiff used the product as intended.

So, the pharmacist's possible defenses would be if he isn't a seller, which I thought might be option H. Or if the product wasn't defective when it left his hands, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, if the misfilling was a mistake that a reasonable person wouldn't make, but strict liability doesn't require negligence. So that's not relevant.

Wait, another thought: the pharmacist is not a manufacturer. The drug store isn't the manufacturer either. So, if the strict liability is against the manufacturer, maybe the pharmacist isn't liable. But that's probably not the case because the pharmacist is part of the distribution chain. So option D says the drug store wasn't the manufacturer. But that's not a defense for the pharmacist himself. The question is about the pharmacist's defense, not the store's.

So, looking back, the best defense might be that he wasn't a seller. But I'm not sure if that's true. Pharmacists are generally considered sellers because they sell the product to the end user. So option H might not be correct.

Wait, another option is that the medication was properly labeled. Option E says the medication was properly labeled with the correct name. Wait, but the pharmacist labeled it as Clinoril, but the actual medication was Clinitest. So the label was incorrect. So E is not correct.

Another option is that the customer misread the label, but she followed the instructions, so that's option J. But the label had the correct name, but the contents were wrong. So she wouldn't have known.

Hmm, maybe the best defense is that he wasn't a seller. So option H. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the fact that the product wasn't defective when it left the manufacturer—wait, no, the defect was the substitution by the pharmacist.

Wait, another angle: strict liability applies when the product is sold in a defective or unreasonably dangerous condition. If the pharmacist was a distributor or seller, then yes. But if he, as a pharmacist, is considered a professional and not a commercial seller, perhaps strict liability doesn't apply. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, maybe the defense is that the product wasn't defective when it left the pharmacist's hands. But wait, he substituted the wrong product, so the product he provided was defective. So that's not a defense.

Wait, perhaps the pharmacist can argue that the customer's injury was due to an unforeseeable misuse. But in this case, the customer used it as directed, so that's not it.

Another possibility: the pharmacist could argue that the drug was not defective but was merely not what was prescribed. But I think that's a defect because it's not what the customer needed, making it unreasonably dangerous in this context.

Wait, but in strict product liability, a defect can be a manufacturing defect (wrong product) or a design defect. In this case, it's a manufacturing defect because the wrong product was provided.

So the pharmacist, as the seller, would be strictly liable unless a defense applies.

Wait, but wait—some defenses in strict liability include that the product was misused, or that the defect was caused by someone else after the product left the defendant's hands. But here, the defect was caused by the pharmacist himself.

So, considering all that, the best defense seems to be that the pharmacist wasn't a seller, which would be option H. But I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate because pharmacists are usually considered part of the chain of distribution.

Alternatively, the defense could be that he exercised reasonable care, but in strict liability, that's not a defense. So perhaps the only possible defense is that he wasn't a seller.

Wait, another thought: the pharmacist is a professional who might be subject to negligence but not strict liability. But I think that's incorrect because strict liability can apply to anyone in the chain of distribution, including retailers.

So, perhaps the best answer is H: He was not a seller of the product upon whom strict liability may be imposed.

But I'm a bit uncertain. Another possibility is that the customer's damages aren't a result of the defect, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, option I: He exercised reasonable care. But as I said earlier, strict liability doesn't depend on care. Unless, perhaps, in a situation where the pharmacist could not have reasonably known, but that's more a negligence defense.

Wait, another thought: strict liability requires that the product was sold in the course of business. If the pharmacist is an employee, perhaps he isn't engaged in the business of selling, but that seems unlikely because he's filling prescriptions as part of his job.

So, perhaps the best defense is that he wasn't a seller, making option H the answer.

In this scenario, the pharmacist misfilled a prescription, substituting Clinoril with Clinitest, a caustic substance not intended for internal use. The customer followed the incorrect instructions, leading to severe injuries. The question asks for the pharmacist's best defense in a strict liability in tort action.

Strict liability applies to sellers or manufacturers of defective products that cause injury when used as intended. The pharmacist, as part of the distribution chain, is generally considered a seller. However, one potential defense is whether the pharmacist qualifies as a "seller" under strict liability. Pharmacists are typically part of the chain of distribution and are considered sellers, but if the pharmacist argues that he was not acting as a commercial seller but rather as a professional, this could be a defense.

Other options, such as the customer's awareness (G) or the medication being properly labeled (E), are not applicable because the label was incorrect, and the customer had no reason to suspect the error. The exercise of reasonable care (I) is irrelevant in strict liability, as liability does not depend on negligence. The argument that the drug store was not the manufacturer (D) does not absolve the pharmacist of liability, as strict liability applies to all parties in the distribution chain.

The best defense for the pharmacist is to argue that he was not a seller of the product upon whom strict liability may be imposed. While pharmacists are typically considered sellers, this could be a viable defense depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances.
