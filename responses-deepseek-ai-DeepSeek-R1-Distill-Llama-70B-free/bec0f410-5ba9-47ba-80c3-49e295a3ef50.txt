Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about machine learning, specifically about SVM and Perceptrons. Hmm, I need to figure out whether each statement is true or false. Let me break it down step by step.

Alright, the question has two statements. Let's tackle them one by one.

**Statement 1:** The SVM learning algorithm is guaranteed to find the globally optimal hypothesis with respect to its object function.

Wait, I remember that SVM uses a convex optimization problem. Convex problems have a single minimum, so any local minimum is the global minimum. That means the algorithm should find the optimal solution, right? So I think Statement 1 is True.

But wait, am I mixing this up with other algorithms? Like, for example, neural networks which have multiple local minima and aren't guaranteed to find the global optimum. No, SVMs are different because of the way the problem is formulated. The hinge loss and the use of kernels make the problem convex. So yes, Statement 1 is True.

**Statement 2:** After being mapped into feature space Q through a radial basis kernel function, a Perceptron may be able to achieve better classification performance than in its original space (though we can’t guarantee this).

Hmm, Perceptrons are linear classifiers, right? They work in the original feature space and can only separate linearly separable data. If the data isn't linearly separable, the Perceptron won't perform well. But if we use a kernel, like a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, it maps the data into a higher-dimensional space where it might become linearly separable. So the idea is that in this new feature space Q, the Perceptron can find a better separating hyperplane, thus improving classification performance.

Wait, does the kernel trick apply to Perceptrons? I thought kernels are mainly used with SVMs. Oh, but technically, any algorithm that can be written in terms of dot products can use kernels. So Perceptrons can too. So by using a kernel, the Perceptron can operate in a higher-dimensional space without explicitly computing the coordinates, which might make the data easier to classify.

But the statement says "may be able to achieve better performance", not that it definitely will. So it's possible that in some cases, the classification improves, but not always. So Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. I thought maybe the Perceptron's convergence depends on the data being linearly separable. So if the kernel maps it into a space where it's linearly separable, then the Perceptron would work. But if not, it won't. So in some cases, it can perform better. So yes, Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but wait another thing. The Perceptron algorithm itself doesn't use kernels. Oh, but the question says "after being mapped into feature space Q through a radial basis kernel function, a Perceptron may achieve better classification...". So, perhaps the feature mapping is done, and then the Perceptron is applied in that space.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to using the kernel trick within the Perceptron's update rule, but I'm not sure if that's standard. But regardless, the statement is about whether the mapping can lead to better performance. So the key point is that using a kernel (implicit mapping) allows the Perceptron to operate in a higher-dimensional space, which could make the data separable. So the statement is correct in that it's possible, though not guaranteed.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is True.

Wait, but looking again at the options. Let me check the options. The options are from A to J. Let's see:

Option F: True, True. That would be if both statements are true.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me think again about Statement 1. What's the exact condition for SVM finding the global optimum? SVM is a convex optimization problem, so under the condition that the problem is convex, it's guaranteed to find the global optimum. So Statement 1 is True.

So both statements are True, so the correct option would be F: True, True.

Wait, but I just remembered that sometimes, in practice, SVM's optimization might get stuck in a local minima with certain solvers, but the question is about the algorithm being guaranteed, which depends on the formulation. Since the problem is convex, any local minima is global. So the algorithm (like Sequential Minimal Optimization) should find the global optimum. So Statement 1 is True.

So Statements 1 is True, Statement 2 is True. So the correct option is F: True, True.

Wait, wait, but looking back at the options, let me make sure. The options are:

A: F, T

B: T, F

C: Statement1 F, 2 not applicable

D: F,F

E: Statement1 T, 2 not applicable

F: T, T

G: 1 part true, 2 F

H: both not applicable

I: 1 not applicable, 2 F

J: 1 N/A, 2 T

So according to my analysis, both are True, so F is the correct option.

Statement 1: The SVM learning algorithm is guaranteed to find the globally optimal hypothesis with respect to its objective function.  
This is true because SVM is formulated as a convex optimization problem. In convex problems, any local minimum is also the global minimum, ensuring that the algorithm finds the optimal solution.

Statement 2: After being mapped into feature space Q through a radial basis kernel function, a Perceptron may be able to achieve better classification performance than in its original space (though we can’t guarantee this).  
This is also true. Perceptrons are linear classifiers that struggle with non-linearly separable data. Using a radial basis kernel maps the data into a higher-dimensional space, potentially making it linearly separable and improving classification performance. While this improvement is not guaranteed, it is possible.

Since both statements are true, the correct answer is:

**F: True, True**

Answer: F
