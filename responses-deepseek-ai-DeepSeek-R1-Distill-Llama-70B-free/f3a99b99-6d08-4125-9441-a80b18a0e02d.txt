Okay, so I've got this question about two's complement numbers and overflow when adding them. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking which pair of 8-bit two's complement numbers will cause an overflow when added. Two's complement is used to represent signed integers, right? So in 8 bits, the range is from -128 to 127. Overflow happens when the sum exceeds these limits.

So each option gives two binary numbers, and I need to check their sum for overflow. Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: 11110000 and 00001111.

First, let's convert these to decimal. 

11110000 in two's complement: Since the first bit is 1, it's negative. The remaining bits are 111000. To find the negative value, invert and add 1. Inverting gives 0001000, which is 8 in decimal. So 8 + 1 is 9. So the value is -9.

00001111 is positive. That's 15 in decimal.

Adding them: -9 + 15 = 6. That's within the 8-bit range, so no overflow. So A is not the answer.

Option B: 01111111 and 10000000.

01111111 is positive. Let's see, that's 127 in decimal because 01111111 is 127.

10000000 is negative. Let's calculate. The remaining bits are 000000, invert to 111111, which is 63 (since 111111 is 63 in 6 bits). Add 1 gives 64, so the value is -64.

Adding them: 127 + (-64) = 63. Still within the range, so no overflow. B isn't the answer.

Option C: 00000001 and 10000000.

00000001 is +1. 10000000 is -128 (since it's 1 followed by zeros, which is the minimum value in two's complement).

Adding them: 1 + (-128) = -127. That's within the range, so no overflow. C is not the answer.

Option D: 10000001 and 10101010.

Let's convert both.

10000001: The sign is negative. The remaining bits are 000001. Invert to 111110, which is 30 (since 111110 is 30 in 6 bits). Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, 8 bits. So 10000001 is 8 bits. The number is negative, so the two's complement is: 10000001.

Inverting gives 01111110, add 1: 01111111. That's 127 in two's complement. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the process is: for a negative number, the value is - (2^7 - value). Or perhaps better to think: take the binary, invert, add 1, and that's the absolute value.

Wait, 10000001 in binary is 129 in 8-bit unsigned. So to get the two's complement value, it's -(256 - 129) = -127? Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, 8 bits: the range is -128 to 127. So 10000001 is -127.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. For an 8-bit two's complement number:

The number is 10000001.

To find the decimal value: the sign bit is 1, so it's negative. The rest is 000001. The value is the negative of (000001 in two's complement as positive). So 000001 is 1, so this is -1?

Wait, no, wait. Because 10000001 is the two's complement representation. Let's compute it properly.

Compute the two's complement of 10000001.

Inverting the bits gives 01111110. Adding 1 gives 01111111, which is 127. So the value is -127. So 10000001 is -127.

Now, the second number in D is 10101010. Let's convert that.

Sign bit is 1, so negative. The rest is 0101010. Wait, that's 7 bits. Let me see: 10101010 is 8 bits, so the sign is 1. The remaining bits are 0101010, which is 42 in decimal. So the two's complement value is - (42 +1) = -43? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the process is: take the number, invert the bits after the sign, add 1. So for 10101010:

Invert bits after sign (the first bit is 1, the rest 0101010 becomes 1010101). Then add 1. 1010101 +1 is 1010110. Now, convert that to decimal.

1010110 in binary is 64 + 16 +4 +2 = 86. So the value is -86.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me check again. Alternatively, I can calculate 10101010 as an 8-bit number: 128 + 32 + 8 + 2 = 170. But since it's negative, it's -(256 - 170) = -86. Yes, that's correct.

So the two numbers are -127 and -86.

Adding them: -127 + (-86) = -213. 

Wait, 8-bit two's complement can represent down to -128. So -213 is below -128, which means it's outside the range, so an overflow occurs. So D is a possible candidate.

Wait, but let me check other options to be sure.

Option E: 11111111 and 00000001.

11111111 is -1 in two's complement. 00000001 is +1.

Adding them: -1 +1 = 0. No overflow, as 0 is within the range. So E is not the answer.

Option F: 11111111 and 10000001.

11111111 is -1, and 10000001 is -127.

Adding them: -1 + (-127) = -128. Wait, that's exactly at the lower limit. So the sum is -128, which is within the 8-bit two's complement range (since -128 is included). So no overflow. So F is not the answer.

Option G: 00000000 and 10000000.

00000000 is 0, and 10000000 is -128.

Adding them: 0 + (-128) = -128. Again, within the range. No overflow. So G isn't the answer.

Option H: 10000001 and 00000001.

10000001 is -127, 00000001 is +1.

Adding them: -127 +1 = -126. Within the range, so no overflow. H isn't the answer.

Option I: 10101010 and 11111111.

10101010 is -86, as we calculated earlier. 11111111 is -1.

Adding them: -86 + (-1) = -87. Which is within the range, so no overflow. So I isn't the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check option D. The sum was -127 + (-86) = -213. The 8-bit two's complement can only represent from -128 to 127. So -213 is way below -128, which would cause an overflow. So option D would result in an overflow.

But wait, in two's complement addition, when adding two numbers, the overflow is detected when the sum exceeds the maximum positive or goes below the minimum negative value. So in D, the sum is -213, which is less than -128, so overflow occurs.

But wait a second, let me think about each step again, as sometimes I might have made a mistake in conversion.

Wait, for option D:

10000001 is in two's complement. Let me confirm its value. The first bit is 1, so negative. The rest are 000001. The inverse would be 111110. Adding 1 gives 111111, which is 127. So the value is -127. Correct.

The second number is 10101010. Which in two's complement is -86. Because 10101010 is 170 in 8 bits unsigned. So 256 - 170 = 86, so it's -86. Correct.

So adding -127 and -86 gives -213. The 8-bit two's complement can only go down to -128. So this would overflow, as the sum is -213, which is less than -128. So yes, D is an overflow.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if I made a mistake with any other options. Let's look at option E again. E is -1 +1 =0, which is fine.

Option F: -1 + (-127) =-128, which is allowed, so no overflow.

What about option B? 01111111 is 127, 10000000 is -128. 127-128 = -1. Which is within the range.

Wait, no, 127 -128 is -1. No, 127 + (-128) is -1, which is within the 8-bit range.

So the only option that causes an overflow is option D. So the answer should be D.
