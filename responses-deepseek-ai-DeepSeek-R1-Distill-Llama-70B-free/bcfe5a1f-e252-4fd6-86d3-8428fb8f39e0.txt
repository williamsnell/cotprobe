Okay, so I've got this question about preventing SQL injection. I remember that SQL injection is a big security issue, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact methods to prevent it. Let me think through this.

The question gives me options from A to J. I need to figure out which one is correct. I remember that SQL injection happens when an attacker is able to insert malicious SQL code into a web application's database, which can extract or modify sensitive data.

So, how do you stop that? I think the main way is to use something called parameterized queries or prepared statements. Oh wait, but the options don't mention that directly. Let's look at the options provided.

Option A is "Merge tables." That doesn't sound right. Merging tables is more about combining data, not security.

Option B: "Escape queries." I've heard of escaping characters, especially in user inputs. Like, if a user inputs a semicolon or apostrophe, escaping those could prevent them from being executed as part of the SQL command. But I'm not sure if escaping alone is enough. I think it's better to use prepared statements which handle escaping automatically and more securely.

Option C: "Use a different programming language." I don't think switching languages inherently prevents SQL injection. It's more about how you write the code. For example, both PHP and Java can be vulnerable if not handled properly.

Option D: "Regularly restart the server." That doesn't make sense. Restarting might help with other issues, but it doesn't prevent injection attacks.

Option E: "Interrupt requests." Not sure what that means. Maybe stopping malicious requests in progress? But that's not a proactive prevention method.

Option F: "Use unfiltered user input directly in queries." Oh, that's definitely bad. That's exactly what causes SQL injection. So F is the wrong approach.

Option G: "Use antivirus software." Antivirus helps with malware, but it doesn't prevent SQL injection attacks, which are more about application vulnerabilities.

Option H: "Use a stronger password for the database." Strong passwords are good for general security, but they don't stop SQL injection because the attack is through the application, not brute-forcing the database login.

Option I: "Write all SQL queries in uppercase." SQL is case-insensitive in most parts, so writing in uppercase doesn't affect security. That doesn't prevent anything.

Option J: "All of the above." Well, that can't be right because some options are clearly wrong, like F and merging tables.

Wait, so the correct answer isn't among the options? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. The best practice is to use prepared statements or parameterized queries, which I don't see listed. Oh, but option B is about escaping queries. Maybe that's the closest option, even though it's not the best method. Or perhaps there's another method I'm forgetting.

Another method I remember is using input validation. So ensuring that user inputs don't contain malicious SQL code. But again, the options don't mention that.

Wait, the options given don't include the most recommended solution, which is prepared statements. So among the options provided, which is the best?

Option B: Escape queries. I think escaping is part of it, but not the most secure on its own. However, maybe in the context of the question, it's the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since the question is multiple-choice, I have to choose from the options given. So if B is escaping, which is a method, though not the best, it's part of the solution.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the options. Let me go through them again.

The question is about preventing SQL injection. The correct methods include using prepared statements (parameterized queries), escaping user inputs properly, and validating inputs. So looking at the options, B is "Escape queries" which is one method, but perhaps not the only one. However, the options don't list a better approach.

So, the best answer from the options given is B: Escape queries. But wait, I've heard that escaping can be error-prone and not foolproof. So maybe the intended answer is something else.

Wait, another thought: using stored procedures can help, but that's not listed either.

Looking back, the options are A through J. The correct answer is likely B, because escaping is a known method, even if not the best. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that none of the options are correct, but since that's not an option, I have to pick the best available.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct answer is that the best way is to use parameterized queries, but that's not an option. So in the given options, B is escape queries, which is better than nothing.

So I think the answer is B.
</think>

To prevent SQL injection, the most effective method is using prepared statements or parameterized queries, which are not listed among the options. However, the closest alternative is "Escape queries," as it involves sanitizing user inputs to prevent malicious SQL code execution. While escaping is not foolproof, it is a known method to mitigate SQL injection risks. Other options like merging tables, using a different programming language, or writing queries in uppercase do not address the issue. Therefore, the best available answer is:

B: Escape queries
