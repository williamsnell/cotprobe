Question:

What is the relationship between the genetic factor and the environmental factor in intelligence?

Options:

A: Intelligence is solely determined by environmental factors
B: Intelligence is solely determined by genetic factors
C: Intelligence fluctuates significantly throughout life, independent of genetic or environmental stability
D: Intelligence is not affected by either genetic or environmental factors
E: Intelligence is determined at birth and remains constant throughout life, regardless of genetics or environment
F: Intelligence is determined by both genetic and environmental factors
G: Intelligence is determined by social factors, with genetics playing a secondary role
H: Intelligence is the result of a complex interplay between genetic factors and life experiences, with environmental factors being less significant
I: Intelligence is primarily determined by educational factors, with minimal influence from genetics or environment
J: Intelligence is determined by a balance of genetic factors, environmental factors, and random chance events

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the relationship between genetic and environmental factors in intelligence. I remember from my psychology classes that intelligence is influenced by both nature and nurture. Let me think through this.

The question asks what the relationship is between genetic and environmental factors. The options are A through J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says intelligence is solely determined by environmental factors. That doesn't sound right because I recall that genetics play a big role too. Studies on twins and adoption show that there's a heritable component.

Option B claims it's solely genetic. That also doesn't seem correct. While genetics are important, environment definitely plays a part. For example, access to education and upbringing can influence intelligence.

Option C suggests intelligence fluctuates a lot and is independent of genetics or environment. I don't think that's accurate. Both factors are considered stable influences, though maybe not completely.

Option D says it's not affected by either. That can't be right because both factors are known to contribute.

Option E says intelligence is determined at birth and stays constant. I think intelligence can change based on experiences, so this isn't correct.

Option F states it's determined by both genetic and environmental factors. This aligns with what I rememberâ€”nature and nurture both play roles.

Option G gives priority to social factors over genetics. While social factors are part of the environment, I don't think it's accurate to say genetics are secondary. It's more of an interaction.

Option H says it's a complex interplay but environment is less significant. I'm not sure. I thought both have substantial impact, not one being less.

Option I focuses on education with minimal genetics or environment. That doesn't seem right because genetics are a strong factor.

Option J includes random chance along with genetics and environment. I'm not sure about the randomness part. The main factors are usually considered genetics and environment.

So the best answer seems to be F. Intelligence is influenced by both genetics and environment. They interact in complex ways, so F makes the most sense.

The relationship between genetic and environmental factors in intelligence is best understood as an interaction between both, where each plays a significant role. Genetic factors provide the foundation, while environmental factors influence development and expression. This dual influence is supported by research on twins and adoption, which highlights the interplay of nature (genetics) and nurture (environment). Therefore, the correct answer is:

F: Intelligence is determined by both genetic and environmental factors.
