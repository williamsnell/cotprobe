Question:

One evening, a defendant set fire to an occupied house. As a result of the blaze, the homeowner's daughter was killed. The defendant was charged with felony murder on the first count and arson on the second count of the two-count indictment. The jury found the defendant guilty on the first count, but returned a not guilty verdict on the second count. The defendant's attorney's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge will be

Options:

A: denied, because the jury's decision in a criminal trial is final.
B: denied, because the verdicts do not amount to a reversible error.
C: denied, because the defendant can be found guilty of felony murder without being found guilty of arson.
D: granted, because the verdicts are contradictory and thus nullify each other.
E: denied, because the felony murder charge stands independent of the arson charge.
F: granted, because the guilty verdict is plain error that adversely affects the defendant's constitutional rights.
G: granted, because the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to an acquittal of both charges.
H: granted, because the defendant was not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
I: granted, as the defendant's attorney presented new evidence that could potentially change the verdict.
J: denied, because the defendant's proper remedy is to seek an appellate review for a non-constitutional error.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with felony murder and arson charges. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A defendant sets fire to an occupied house, which results in the death of the homeowner's daughter. The charges are two countsâ€”first count is felony murder, second is arson. The jury found the defendant guilty on the first count but not guilty on the second. Now, the defense attorney is moving to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge, and we need to determine if this motion will be granted or denied, and why.

I remember that felony murder is a doctrine where a death occurs during the commission of a felony. The underlying felony here would be arson because setting fire to an occupied building is arson. So, felony murder requires that the defendant was committing a felony (like arson) and that a death resulted from it.

But wait, the jury acquitted the defendant on the arson charge. So, how can someone be guilty of felony murder if they weren't guilty of the underlying felony? That seems contradictory. I've heard that in some jurisdictions, the felony murder rule requires the defendant to be convicted of the underlying felony. But I'm not entirely sure if all jurisdictions handle this the same way.

I think about the concept of legal consistency in verdicts. If the jury finds the defendant not guilty of arson, can they still be guilty of felony murder based on that same arson? I remember a case where the Supreme Court held that if the underlying felony is an essential element of the felony murder charge, then acquittal on the felony would make the felony murder conviction invalid. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

So, in this case, the two counts were felony murder (count 1) and arson (count 2). The jury found the defendant guilty on count 1 but not guilty on count 2. If the felony murder charge relies on the arson as the underlying felony, then the not guilty verdict on count 2 might undermine the conviction on count 1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the defendant can be guilty of felony murder without being guilty of arson. Is that possible? I thought that felony murder requires the underlying felony. But maybe in some cases, like when the felony is a lesser included offense, but I'm not sure.

Option E says the felony murder charge stands independent of the arson. That doesn't sound right because felony murder is based on the commission of another felony. If the defendant isn't guilty of that felony, how can they be guilty of felony murder?

Option B says the verdicts don't amount to a reversible error. But if the guilty verdict on felony murder hinges on the arson, and the defendant was acquitted of arson, that seems like a fundamental error.

Option D suggests the verdicts are contradictory and nullify each other. That makes sense if both charges depend on the same underlying facts. But I'm not certain if the law allows such inconsistency.

Option G says the verdicts are legally inconsistent and should lead to acquittal of both charges. That seems possible if the felony murder charge requires the defendant to be guilty of the underlying felony.

Wait, I think the key here is whether the jury's verdicts are legally inconsistent. If they are, then the guilty verdict on felony murder might not stand because it's based on an acquitted charge.

In some jurisdictions, a conviction for felony murder requires the defendant to be convicted of the underlying felony. So, if the jury acquitted on the underlying felony, then the felony murder conviction can't stand because it's based on the same act. Therefore, the verdicts would be inconsistent, and the guilty verdict would have to be set aside.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions might allow the felony murder conviction even without the underlying felony conviction if it's based on different evidence. But I'm not sure about that.

Looking back at the options, option C says the defendant can be guilty of felony murder without being guilty of arson. If that's correct, then the verdicts aren't inconsistent, and the motion would be denied. But I thought that the underlying felony is a required element.

Wait, maybe the felony murder doesn't require a conviction of the underlying felony, just that the defendant committed it. So even if the jury acquitted on the arson charge, perhaps they still found that the defendant committed the arson for the purposes of felony murder. But that seems odd because the same jury would be considering both charges.

But wait, in a single trial, if the jury found the defendant not guilty of arson, can they still find them guilty of felony murder based on that same arson? Or does the acquittal on the arson count mean that the necessary element for felony murder is missing?

I think the answer depends on whether the felony murder charge requires the defendant to have been convicted of the underlying felony or merely that the felony was committed. If it's the latter, then the defendant can be guilty of felony murder without being convicted of the underlying felony. But if the former, then the conviction can't stand.

Upon further reflection, I believe that in felony murder, the prosecution must prove that the defendant committed the underlying felony, but the defendant doesn't necessarily have to be convicted of it in a separate count. So, the jury could find the defendant guilty of felony murder even if they find them not guilty of the arson, as long as they believe that the defendant committed the arson for the purposes of felony murder.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the same jury is deciding both counts. If they found the defendant not guilty of arson, how can they find them guilty of felony murder based on that same arson? It seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, maybe the jury could have found that the defendant committed the arson for the felony murder but not for the arson charge because of some legal distinction, like intent or another element. But I'm not sure.

I think the key here is that for felony murder, the underlying felony doesn't need to be charged or convicted. So, even if the defendant is acquitted of the arson charge, the felony murder conviction can still stand because the jury could have found that the defendant committed the arson for the purposes of felony murder, but perhaps had a reasonable doubt on some element of the arson charge itself.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. If the same jury is considering both charges, and they find not guilty on arson, how can they find guilty on felony murder? It seems logically inconsistent because the felony murder requires the commission of the felony.

But maybe the felony murder charge is based on a different set of facts or elements. For example, perhaps the felony murder doesn't require all the elements of the underlying felony. Or maybe the jury found that the defendant committed the arson but for some reason didn't find all the elements necessary for the arson charge. But I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the felony murder charge doesn't require the defendant to be convicted of the underlying felony; it just needs to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the felony was committed, regardless of the outcome of the separate charge.

In that case, the jury could find the defendant guilty of felony murder even if they acquitted them on the arson count because they might have had reasonable doubt on one element of the arson charge but not on the elements needed for felony murder.

So, if that's the case, the verdicts wouldn't necessarily be inconsistent, and the motion to set aside the felony murder conviction would be denied.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: denied, because the defendant can be found guilty of felony murder without being found guilty of arson.

So, if the felony murder doesn't require a conviction on the underlying felony, just that the felony was committed, then the verdicts aren't inconsistent, and the motion would be denied.

I think this is correct because the underlying felony in felony murder doesn't need to be a separate conviction; it just needs to be proven as part of the felony murder charge. Therefore, even if the jury acquitted on the arson count, they might have still found that the defendant committed the arson for the purposes of felony murder.

So the correct answer would be option C.

The scenario involves a defendant charged with felony murder (count 1) and arson (count 2) after setting fire to an occupied house, resulting in the death of the homeowner's daughter. The jury found the defendant guilty on the felony murder charge but not guilty on the arson charge. The question is whether the defendant's motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge will be granted or denied.

Felony murder is a doctrine where a death occurs during the commission of a felony. In this case, the underlying felony would be arson. However, the jury acquitted the defendant on the arson charge, raising the question of whether the felony murder conviction can stand without a conviction on the underlying felony.

Key considerations include:

1. **Felony Murder and Underlying Felony**: Felony murder requires that the defendant committed a felony (in this case, arson) during which a death occurred. However, in some jurisdictions, the defendant does not need to be convicted of the underlying felony for a felony murder conviction to stand. Instead, it is sufficient for the prosecution to prove that the felony was committed, even if the defendant is acquitted of the separate felony charge.

2. **Jury Verdicts and Consistency**: The jury acquitted the defendant on the arson charge but convicted them on the felony murder charge. While this may seem inconsistent at first glance, it is possible for the jury to find that the defendant committed the arson for the purposes of felony murder while harboring reasonable doubt about certain elements of the arson charge itself.

3. **Legal Inconsistency**: The verdicts are not necessarily contradictory because the felony murder charge does not depend on a conviction for the underlying felony. Instead, it depends on the proof of the felony's commission during the crime. Therefore, the guilty verdict on felony murder can stand independently of the acquittal on the arson charge.

Given these considerations, the motion to set aside the guilty verdict on the felony murder charge will likely be denied because the defendant can be found guilty of felony murder without being convicted of arson. The verdicts are not legally inconsistent, and the felony murder charge stands independent of the arson charge.
