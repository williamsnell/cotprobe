Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these concepts yet. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that 100 grains of benzene is vaporized at its boiling point of 80.2°C under 760 torr pressure. I need to calculate four things: a) W_rev, b) q, c) ΔH, and d) ΔE. Oh wait, looking at the options, it looks like they've provided all four values for each choice, so I guess I need to compute each of these.

First, I should probably recall some basic thermodynamics formulas. I remember that when dealing with phase changes, like vaporization, the heat involved is related to the heat of vaporization (or enthalpy of vaporization). Also, for processes at constant pressure, the heat q is equal to ΔH, which is enthalpy change. Since vaporization occurs at a constant temperature (boiling point), this is likely a phase change where q is calculated using the heat of vaporization.

Wait, the data given: the heat of vaporization is 94.4 cal/g. So, the benzene is vaporizing, which is an endothermic process, so q will be positive. But wait, the system is absorbing heat, so from the surroundings, but in terms of work done by the system, I think the work done by the system (like expanding against atmospheric pressure) is considered negative when the system does work on the surroundings.

Let me jot down the given data:

Mass of benzene = 100 grains. Wait, grains? That's not grams. Oh, I remember that in the old system, 1 grain is about 0.0648 grams. So 100 grains would be 100 * 0.0648 = 6.48 grams. Wait, but let me confirm that conversion factor. Oh right, 1 grain is approximately 0.0648 grams. So 100 grains is 6.48 grams.

Heat of vaporization (ΔHvap) is given as 94.4 cal/g. So for 6.48 grams, the total heat q would be 94.4 cal/g * 6.48 g. Let me calculate that: 94.4 * 6.48. Hmm, 94 *6 is 564, 94 *0.48 is about 45.12. So 564 +45.12= 609.12, but wait, maybe I should compute more accurately.

Wait, 94.4 *6 = 566.4, 94.4 *0.48 = let's see, 94.4 * 0.4 is 37.76, and 94.4 *0.08 is 7.552. So 37.76 +7.552=45.312. So total q is 566.4 + 45.312=611.712 cal. Wait, but none of the options have 611 cal for q. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass conversion.

Wait, maybe I got the conversion wrong. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, 1 grain is 0.0648 grams, so 100 grains is 6.48 grams. So that part seems correct. So q is 6.48 grams *94.4 cal/g = 611.712 cal. But looking at the options, the q values are in the thousands, like 9440, 9400, etc. Wait, wait, wait! Did I miss a decimal point?

Wait, the heat of vaporization is given as 94.4 cal/g, but maybe that's 94.4 cal per gram. So 6.48 grams would be 6.48 *94.4. Let me recalculate that.

6 *94.4 = 566.4, 0.48 *94.4 = let's compute 0.4 *94.4=37.76, 0.08 *94.4=7.552. So 37.76 +7.552=45.312. So total q=566.4+45.312=611.712 cal. But looking at the options, for example, option A has q=9440 cal. That's way higher. So I'm missing something here.

Wait, wait a second. Oh! Maybe the mass is 100 grams, not grains. Because 100 grams would make sense with the options, but the question says 100 grains. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.

The problem says: 100 grains of benzene. So 100 grains is about 6.48 grams, as I calculated. Then q would be around 611 cal, but the options have q around 9000-9500. So that's a big discrepancy. Did I convert grains to grams wrong?

Wait, perhaps the unit is grains, but in the context of the problem, maybe it's 100 grams, but the question says grains. Or perhaps the question actually says grams, and I misread it. Let me look again.

Wait, the question says "100 grains of benzene is vaporized at its boiling point of 80.2°C." So it's definitely 100 grains, which is 6.48 grams. So why are the options so much higher?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Oh wait, no, the heat of vaporization is given as 94.4 cal/g. So 6.48 grams would be 6.48 *94.4 = 611.71 cal. But that's way less than the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the mass.

Wait, perhaps I should check the conversion again. Let me see: 1 grain is 0.0648 grams. So 100 grains is 6.48 grams. That seems correct. So 6.48 grams *94.4 cal/g = 611.71 cal. But the options are much higher. So perhaps I'm missing a decimal point. Alternatively, maybe the heat of vaporization is given in different units. Wait, the heat of vaporization is 94.4 cal/g. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different unit for the mass, like 100 grams. Let me recalculate that. If it's 100 grams, then q would be 100 *94.4 = 9440 cal. That matches option A's q value. But the question says 100 grains, not grams. So perhaps there's a mistake in the question, but given the options, maybe I should proceed with 100 grams.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the term 'grains' in this context. Wait, grains is a unit of mass, but perhaps in some contexts, it's used differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem intended to say 100 grams, but wrote grains by mistake. Because with 100 grams, the q would be 9440 cal, which matches some options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm missing something else. Let's think about the other parts. The question also asks for work (W_rev), which is the reversible work done during vaporization. I remember that for vaporization at constant temperature and pressure, the work done is PΔV. Since the system is expanding (liquid to gas), the system does work on the surroundings, so W_rev should be negative.

The formula for reversible work (W_rev) is -P_ext ΔV. At constant pressure, PΔV = nRT, but since it's vaporization, maybe we can model it as an ideal gas. Benzene vapor can be approximated as an ideal gas at the boiling point.

Wait, the process is vaporization at the boiling point, which is a phase change at constant temperature and pressure. So the work done should be W = -PΔV. Since the pressure is 1 atm (760 torr), and assuming that the volume of the liquid is negligible compared to the gas, ΔV is approximately equal to the volume of the gas.

So, for n moles of benzene, ΔV = nRT/P. So W_rev = -nRT.

Wait, since W_rev is the work done by the system, it will be negative because the system is doing work on the surroundings.

But wait, to find n, I need the number of moles. Let me compute that.

The molar mass of benzene (C6H6) is 6*12.01 + 6*1.008 = 72.06 + 6.048 = 78.108 g/mol.

So mass is 6.48 grams (from 100 grains) → moles = 6.48 g / 78.108 g/mol ≈ 0.0829 mol.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, T is the boiling point in Kelvin. Boiling point is 80.2°C, which is 353.3 K.

So ΔV = nRT/P → since P is 1 atm, ΔV = nRT. So W_rev = -nRT.

Plugging in the numbers: n ≈ 0.0829 mol, R=0.0821, T=353.3 K.

nRT = 0.0829 * 0.0821 *353.3 → let me compute that.

First, 0.0829 * 0.0821 ≈ 0.00681.

Then, 0.00681 *353.3 ≈ 2.407.

So W_rev ≈ -2.407 L·atm. But we need to convert that into calories because the other quantities are in cal.

I remember that 1 L·atm is approximately 24.217 cal. So 2.407 L·atm *24.217 cal/(L·atm) ≈ 58.3 cal.

So W_rev ≈ -58.3 cal. But looking at the options, the W_rev values are around -800 to -900 cal. So that can't be right. What did I do wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. If the mass is 100 grams instead of 6.48 grams, then moles would be 100 /78.108 ≈ 1.28 mol.

Then, nRT = 1.28 * 0.0821 *353.3 → Let's compute that.

1.28 * 0.0821 = 0.1051.

0.1051 *353.3 ≈ 37.12 L·atm.

Converting to cal: 37.12 *24.217 ≈ 37 *24 = 888 cal. So W_rev ≈ -888 cal, which is about -888 cal, which is close to option A's -898 cal. But why?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Because if the mass is 100 grains, which is 6.48 grams, then the W_rev is about -58 cal, but that's not matching any options. So perhaps the question intended 100 grams, not grains. Because then the numbers make sense.

So perhaps the correct approach is to treat the mass as 100 grams, leading to q=9440 cal (as 100 *94.4 =9440), which matches option A's q=9440 cal.

Then, W_rev would be about -888 cal, which is close to option A's -898 cal. The slight difference might be due to rounding.

Wait, let's compute more accurately. With 100 grams:

Molar mass of benzene is 78.108 g/mol → 100 g /78.108 g/mol ≈1.28 mol.

n=1.28 mol.

R=0.08206 L·atm/(mol·K).

T=80.2°C=353.35 K.

So nRT=1.28 *0.08206 *353.35.

Compute 1.28 *0.08206 first.

1.28 *0.08 =0.1024, 1.28 *0.00206≈0.00263. So total ≈0.10503.

Then 0.10503 *353.35 = Let's compute 0.1 *353.35=35.335, 0.00503 *353.35≈1.777. So total ≈35.335+1.777≈37.112 L·atm.

Convert to cal: 37.112 L·atm * 24.217 cal/(L·atm) ≈37.112 *24.217.

Let me compute that more accurately.

37 *24 = 888.

0.112 *24=2.688 → total 890.688.

0.112 *0.217≈0.0243 → total ≈890.688 +0.0243≈890.71 cal.

Wait, but wait, 37.112 *24.217 = ?

37 *24 = 888.

37 *0.217 = 8.029.

0.112 *24 = 2.688.

0.112 *0.217≈0.0243.

So adding them up: 888 +8.029=896.029 +2.688=898.717 +0.0243≈898.74 cal.

So W_rev ≈ -898.74 cal, which is approximately -898 cal, matching option A's W_rev of -898 cal.

So then, q is 100 g *94.4 cal/g =9440 cal. So q=9440 cal, which matches option A's q=9440.

ΔH is the enthalpy change, which at constant pressure is equal to q. So ΔH=9440 cal.

Now, for ΔE (the change in internal energy), we can use the first law of thermodynamics: ΔE = q + W. Wait, no, wait: the first law is ΔE = q - W, but wait, I need to check the sign conventions.

Wait, the first law is ΔE = q - W, where W is the work done by the system. Since W_rev is negative (work done by the system is considered negative in the formula), then:

ΔE = q - W_rev.

So W_rev is -898 cal, so substituting:

ΔE = 9440 cal - (-898 cal) =9440 +898=10338 cal. Wait, that's way higher than any option given. But that can't be right because none of the options have ΔE over 10,000 cal. Wait, I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the correct formula is ΔE = q - W, where W is the work done by the system. So if W is negative, then ΔE = q - (-|W|) = q + |W|.

Wait, but let me think again. The system does work (expands), so W is negative. So W = -898 cal.

So ΔE = q + W → 9440 + (-898) = 8542 cal.

Wait, no, wait: the first law is ΔE = q - W, where W is work done by the system. So if the system does work (W positive), then ΔE = q - W.

In this case, W_rev is negative because the system is doing work on the surroundings. So W_rev = -898 cal. So substituting:

ΔE = q - (-898) = q +898 =9440 +898=10338 cal. That doesn't make sense because the options have ΔE around 8500-8600.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me check.

Wait, another approach: For vaporization at constant temperature, the internal energy change can be calculated using ΔU = nC_v ΔT. But since it's a phase change at constant temperature, ΔT=0, so ΔU would be due to the phase change only, which complicates things. Alternatively, maybe I can use the ideal gas law for the vapor.

Wait, perhaps another formula: For an ideal gas, ΔU = nC_v ΔT. But since the process is at constant temperature, ΔT=0, so ΔU=0. But that's only true if the gas is ideal and the temperature doesn't change. But benzene vapor is not an ideal gas, perhaps, but maybe as an approximation.

Wait, but wait, this doesn't seem right because the internal energy should change when going from liquid to gas. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relation between ΔH and ΔU.

We know that ΔH = ΔU + Δ(PV). For an ideal gas, PV = nRT, so Δ(PV) = Δ(nRT) = nRΔT. But since the temperature is constant, ΔT=0, so Δ(PV)=0. Therefore, ΔH = ΔU for an ideal gas at constant temperature. But wait, that can't be right because for phase changes, ΔH includes the work done.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The correct relation is ΔH = ΔU + PΔV. So for the process, PΔV is the work done, which is W_rev = -PΔV. So ΔH = q_p (since at constant pressure, q = ΔH). So from the first law, ΔU = q - W.

But since W = -PΔV, then ΔU = q - (-PΔV) = q + PΔV. But PΔV = nRT, so ΔU = q + nRT.

Wait, but wait, in this case, q is the heat absorbed, which is positive. So let me compute it.

We have q = 9440 cal, W_rev = -898 cal (since work done by the system is -ve).

So ΔU = q + W → because W is the work done by the system, which is negative, so ΔU = 9440 + (-898) = 8542 cal.

Wait, that would give ΔU =8542 cal. Let me check: 9440 -898 = 8542. Yes.

Looking at the options, option A has ΔE=8542 cal. So that matches.

So putting it all together:

a) W_rev = -898 cal.

b) q =9440 cal.

c) ΔH=9440 cal.

d) ΔE=8542 cal.

Looking at the options, option A is:

A: W_rev= - 898 cal, q = 9440 cal, ΔH = 9440 cal, ΔE = 8542 cal.

So the correct answer would be option A.

To solve the problem, we calculate the thermodynamic quantities for the vaporization of benzene at its boiling point of 80.2°C under 760 torr. The key steps are as follows:
