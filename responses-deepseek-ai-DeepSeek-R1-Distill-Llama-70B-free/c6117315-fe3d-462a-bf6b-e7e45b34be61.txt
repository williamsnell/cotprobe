Question:

In Jules Verne's 1865 story with this title, three men went to the moon in a shell fired from a giant cannon sunk in the earth in Florida. Find the minimum muzzle speed that would allow a shell to escape from the earth completely (the escape speed). Neglect air resistance, the earth's rotation, and the gravitational pull of the moon. The earth's radius and mass are $R_E}=$ $6.38 \times 10^6 m$ and $m_E=5.97 \times 10^{24} kg$. (Unit: 10 ^ 4 m/s)

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about escape velocity. Hmm, I remember that escape velocity is the speed you need to go to break free from a planet's gravity without any further propulsion. The question gives me Earth's radius and mass, and asks for the escape speed. Let's see.

Wait, the formula for escape velocity is something like the square root of (2*G*M/R), right? Or wait, is it square root of (G*M/R)? No, wait, I think I'm mixing it up. Oh right, escape velocity v is sqrt(2GM/R), but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Oh yeah, the gravitational potential energy is -GMm/R, and kinetic energy is 1/2 mv². To escape, the kinetic energy needs to overcome the gravitational potential, so 1/2 mv² = GMm/R. Wait, no, because the potential energy is negative, so to escape, the kinetic energy must be equal to the absolute value of the potential energy. So 1/2 mv² = GMm/R. Then solving for v gives sqrt(2GM/R). Right, that's the formula.

Okay, so I need to plug in the numbers. Let me get the values:

Earth's mass, M = 5.97e24 kg.

Earth's radius, R = 6.38e6 meters.

G is the gravitational constant, which I think is 6.674e-11 N(m/kg)^2.

So the formula is v = sqrt( (2 * G * M) / R )

Let me compute the numerator first. 2 * G * M. Let's see, 2 * 6.674e-11 * 5.97e24.

Compute that step by step.

2 * 6.674e-11 = 1.3348e-10.

Multiply by 5.97e24: 1.3348e-10 *5.97e24.

Let me compute 1.3348 *5.97 first. 1.3348 *5 is 6.674, 1.3348 *0.97 is approximately 1.297. So total is about 7.971.

So 7.971e14 (since 1e-10 *1e24 =1e14). So the numerator is 7.971e14.

Then, divide by R, which is 6.38e6 meters.

So 7.971e14 /6.38e6 = approximately 1.249e8 (since 7.97/6.38 is around 1.249, and 1e14/1e6 = 1e8).

So now take the square root of 1.249e8.

Wait, sqrt(1.249e8) = sqrt(1.249) * sqrt(1e8).

sqrt(1e8) is 1e4, because (1e4)^2 is 1e8.

sqrt(1.249) is approximately 1.118, since 1.118 squared is about 1.25 (because 1.1^2 is 1.21, 1.12^2 is 1.2544, which is a bit higher than 1.249, so maybe closer to 1.117 or so.

Wait, let me compute 1.118 squared: 1.118 * 1.118 = (approx) 1.25. So 1.118 *1e4 gives 1.118e4 m/s.

Wait, but wait, 1.118e4 m/s is 11180 m/s. But the options are given in units of 1e4 m/s. So 1.118e4 is 11.18e3 m/s, which is 1.118 *1e4, so 11.18 x10^3 m/s, so in terms of 1e4 units, that would be approximately 1.118. But looking at the options, let's see.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me compute the numerator again. 2 * G * M.

G is 6.674e-11, M is 5.97e24.

So 2 *6.674e-11 = 1.3348e-10.

1.3348e-10 *5.97e24 = let's compute:

First, multiply 1.3348 *5.97.

1.3348 *5 =6.674.

1.3348 *0.97 = let's compute that.

0.97 *1.3348:

1.3348 *0.9 = 1.20132.

1.3348 *0.07=0.093436.

Adding them: 1.20132 +0.093436=1.294756.

So total 6.674 +1.294756=7.968756.

So 7.968756e14.

Then, divide by R, which is 6.38e6.

So 7.968756e14 /6.38e6 = (7.968756/6.38) *1e8.

Compute 7.968756 /6.38.

Let me see: 6.38 *1.25 =7.975, because 6 *1.25=7.5, 0.38*1.25=0.475, total 7.975.

Oh, our numerator is 7.968756, which is just a bit less than 7.975, so 7.968756 /6.38 is approximately 1.249 approximately.

So 1.249e8.

Now square root of 1.249e8 m²/s².

So sqrt(1.249e8) = sqrt(1.249)*sqrt(1e8).

sqrt(1e8)=1e4=10,000 m/s.

sqrt(1.249)= approx 1.118.

So 1.118 *1e4 =11,180 m/s.

Wait, but the options are in units of 1e4 m/s. So 11.18e3 m/s is 1.118e4 m/s, which would be 1.118 in units of 1e4.

Looking at the options: option C is 1.12, which is the closest to 1.118. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I have the formula correct. Another way to calculate escape velocity is v = sqrt(2 * g * R), where g is the surface gravity. Wait, but I don't have g here. Alternatively, using the other formula.

Wait, another way to compute escape velocity is using v = sqrt( (2 G M) / R ), which is what I did. So I think the calculation is correct. So the correct option is C: 1.12.
</think>

To determine the escape velocity from Earth, we use the formula:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2 G M}{R}}
\]

where:  
- \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \) (gravitational constant),  
- \( M = 5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \) (Earth's mass),  
- \( R = 6.38 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \) (Earth's radius).  

### Step 1: Compute the numerator \( 2 G M \)
\[
2 G M = 2 \times (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \times (5.97 \times 10^{24})
\]
\[
2 G M = 1.3348 \times 10^{-10} \times 5.97 \times 10^{24} = 7.968756 \times 10^{14}
\]

### Step 2: Divide by \( R \)
\[
\frac{2 G M}{R} = \frac{7.968756 \times 10^{14}}{6.38 \times 10^6} = 1.249 \times 10^8
\]

### Step 3: Take the square root
\[
v = \sqrt{1.249 \times 10^8} = \sqrt{1.249} \times \sqrt{10^8}
\]
\[
\sqrt{1.249} \approx 1.118, \quad \sqrt{10^8} = 10^4
\]
\[
v \approx 1.118 \times 10^4 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 4: Convert to the given unit (\( 10^4 \, \text{m/s} \))
\[
v \approx 1.118 \, \text{(in units of \( 10^4 \, \text{m/s} \))}.
\]

### Final Answer
The closest option to \( 1.118 \) is **1.12**, which corresponds to **option C**.
