Okay, so I have this physics problem about electric fields from two charges. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the problem says there are two particles fixed on the x-axis. Particle 1 has a charge q1 = 2.1e-8 C and is at x=20 cm. Particle 2 has a charge q2 = -4.00 q1, so that's -4 times q1. Let me calculate what q2 is. Oh wait, I don't know if I need the actual number right away, but maybe it's useful. So q2 is -8.4e-8 C, right?

The question is asking where the net electric field is zero. So I need to find a point along the x-axis where the electric fields from these two charges cancel each other out.

I remember that the electric field E is given by E = k*q / r², where k is Coulomb's constant, q is the charge, and r is the distance from the charge to the point where we're calculating the field.

Since the charges are on the x-axis, the electric fields will be along this line too. The direction depends on the sign of the charge. Positive charges create fields that point away from them, and negative charges create fields that point towards them.

Wait, so I need to find a point x where the fields from q1 and q2 are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Let me think about where this could happen. There are two regions to consider: between the two charges and outside the two charges on either end.

Let me visualize this. q1 is at 20 cm, and q2 is at 70 cm. So the distance between them is 50 cm. If I consider a point to the left of q1 (like x < 20 cm), then both charges would be to the right of that point. How would their fields behave?

At a point left of q1, q1's field would point to the left (since it's positive, field lines go away, so left). q2 is negative, so its field at that point would point towards q2, which is to the right. So the fields from q1 and q2 in this region would be in opposite directions. Hmm, maybe that's where they could cancel.

Alternatively, if I look to the right of q2, say x >70 cm. There, q1's field would point to the right (since it's a positive charge and the field is away), and q2's field, being negative, would point towards q2, which is to the left. So in this region, both fields would be in opposite directions again. Wait, no. Let me think again: if I'm to the right of q2, then the field from q1 (positive) would point right (since I'm right of q1, the field direction is away), and the field from q2 (negative) would point towards it, which is to the left. So in this region, the fields are in opposite directions. So it's possible for them to cancel here as well.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about their magnitudes. Because the charges have different magnitudes. q2 is four times as big as q1 in magnitude, but opposite in sign.

Wait, q2 is -4 q1, so the magnitude is 4 times q1's. So, when considering the electric fields, the field from q2 will be larger in magnitude than that from q1, unless the distance makes the fields comparable.

So, maybe the point where the fields cancel is to the right of q2. Because q2 produces a stronger field, so to balance it, the point might need to be closer to q2 than to q1. Or perhaps to the left of q1.

Wait, let's consider each region.

First, the region left of q1 (x < 20 cm):

At a point x here, the distance from q1 is (20 - x) cm, and from q2 is (70 - x) cm. Since q1 is positive, the field from q1 points to the left (because the point is left of q1, so field direction is away from q1, which is left). The field from q2 (negative) points towards q2, which is to the right.

So E1 (from q1) is to the left, E2 (from q2) is to the right. So if E1 and E2 are equal in magnitude, they'll cancel each other.

So in this region, E_net = E1 (left) + E2 (right) = 0. So E1 = E2 in magnitude but opposite in direction.

So the equation would be k q1 / (r1)^2 = k q2 / (r2)^2, but wait, I need to get the signs right. Wait, no. Because the fields are in opposite directions, so their magnitudes must be equal.

Wait, but the charges are opposite in sign. Because q2 is negative, the field from q2 is in the opposite direction of the unit vector pointing from the charge to the point. Hmm, maybe I should just focus on the magnitudes, considering the directions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to represent the electric fields as vectors. Let me think about the directions.

In the left region (x < 20 cm), the field from q1 is to the left (since it's positive), and the field from q2 is to the right (because it's negative, so field points towards it, which is to the right at a point left of q2). So for the fields to cancel, E1 (left) must equal E2 (right) in magnitude. So the equation would be:

( k q1 ) / ( (20 - x) )² = ( k |q2| ) / ( (70 - x) )² )

Because E1 is left, E2 is right, but we can set their magnitudes equal.

Wait, but q2 is negative, so |q2| is 4 q1. So substituting, |q2| = 4 q1.

So the equation becomes:

k q1 / (20 - x)^2 = k (4 q1) / (70 - x)^2

The k's and q1's cancel out from both sides:

1/(20 - x)^2 = 4 / (70 - x)^2

Take square roots on both sides:

1/(20 - x) = 2/(70 - x)

Wait, but wait, let's square root carefully. Taking square roots of both sides of 1/(a)^2 = 4/(b)^2 gives (1/a) = 2/(b), but considering positive roots because distance is positive.

So, 1/(20 - x) = 2/(70 - x)

Cross-multiplying:

70 - x = 2 (20 - x )

70 - x = 40 - 2x

Bring like terms together:

70 -40 = -2x + x

30 = -x

So x = -30 cm.

Wait, that's one of the options. Option C is -30 cm. So that's a possible point.

But wait, does this make sense? Let me check.

So, x is at -30 cm. That's 50 cm to the left of q1 (which is at 20 cm). So the distance from q1 is 20 - (-30) = 50 cm. From q2, it's 70 - (-30) = 100 cm.

So E1 is k*(2.1e-8) / (0.5)^2 = since 50 cm is 0.5 meters.

E2 is k*(4*2.1e-8) / (1.0)^2 = k*8.4e-8 / 1.

Wait, E1 is (2.1e-8) / 0.25 = 8.4e-8 C /(m^2). E2 is 8.4e-8 C / (1 m²). So E1 is 8.4e-8, E2 is 8.4e-8, so same magnitude. But directions: E1 points left, E2 points right. So they indeed cancel. So that's a valid point.

But wait, what about the other possibility? The region to the right of q2, x>70 cm.

In that case, the distance from q1 is x - 20 cm, and from q2 is x -70 cm.

The field from q1 (positive) points to the right (since the point is to the right of q1), and the field from q2 (negative) points to the left (because field lines go into the negative charge). So in this region, E1 is right, E2 is left. So the net field could be zero if E1 = E2 in magnitude but opposite direction.

So the equation would be:

k q1 / (x - 20)^2 = k |q2| / (x -70)^2

Again, substituting |q2|=4 q1,

q1/(x-20)^2 = 4 q1/(x-70)^2

Cancel q1:

1/(x-20)^2 =4/(x-70)^2

Take square roots:

1/(x-20) = 2/(x-70)

So cross-multiplying:

x-70 = 2(x -20 )

x-70=2x -40

Subtract x both sides:

-70 = x -40

x = -30 cm.

Wait, that's the same x as before. But wait, we're considering x>70 cm, but this solution gives x=-30 cm, which is less than 70. So this solution isn't in the region we're considering (right of q2), so it's not valid here. So that means that in the right region, there's no solution because the x obtained doesn't lie in that region. So the only solution is x = -30 cm.

Wait, but I thought when I considered the right region, maybe another solution exists. Let me re-examine the equation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me rederive that.

In the region x >70 cm:

E1 points to the right (from q1), E2 points to the left (from q2). For the fields to cancel, E1 must equal E2 in magnitude.

So:

E1 = k q1 / (x-20)^2 (direction right)
E2 = k |q2| / (x-70)^2 (direction left)

So E1 = E2 in magnitude:

k q1 / (x-20)^2 = k |q2| / (x-70)^2

Again, |q2|=4 q1, so substituting:

q1/(x-20)^2 = 4 q1/(x-70)^2

Cancel q1:

1/(x-20)^2 =4/(x-70)^2

Take square roots:

1/(x-20) = 2/(x-70)

So  x-70 = 2*(x-20)

x-70=2x-40

x-70-2x = -40

- x -70 = -40

- x = 30

x = -30 cm.

Wait, same result. So this suggests that the solution x=-30 cm is the only point where E is zero. But that's in the left region, not the right.

So the point is at x=-30 cm, which is option C.

But wait, the question says "other than at infinity". So that's acceptable.

Wait, but let me think again. Because when you have a positive and a negative charge, the point where their fields cancel could be in between them, but only if one is positive and the other negative. But wait, in this case, q1 is positive, q2 is negative. So in between, the fields could be in the same direction, making it impossible for them to cancel. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the region between q1 and q2 (20 cm < x <70 cm). At a point in between, the field from q1 (positive) points right (since point is right of q1), and the field from q2 (negative) points left (since point is left of q2, so towards q2 which is negative). So E1 to the right and E2 to the left. So their fields are in opposite directions. So it's possible for them to cancel here.

So perhaps there's another solution in this region.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier by only considering the left and right regions but not the middle. So I should check if a solution exists there.

So let's set up the equation for 20 <x <70.

In this region, E1 points right, E2 points left. So their fields oppose each other, so net E is zero when E1 = E2.

So:

E1 = k q1 / (x-20)^2 (to the right)
E2 = k |q2| / (70 -x)^2 (to the left)

So for the fields to cancel, their magnitudes must be equal:

k q1 / (x-20)^2 = k |q2| / (70 -x)^2 

Again, |q2|=4 q1, so:

q1/(x-20)^2 =4 q1/(70 -x)^2 

Cancel q1:

1/(x-20)^2 =4/(70-x)^2 

Take square roots:

1/(x-20) = 2/(70 -x )

Cross-multiply: 70 -x = 2(x -20 )

70 -x = 2x -40

70 +40 = 3x

110 =3x

x= 110/3 ≈36.666... cm.

Wait, that's approximately 36.67 cm. Looking at the options, F is 30 cm, G is 50, E is 40. So 36.67 isn't among the options. Hmm, but let's recheck the calculations.

Wait, did I get that right? So in the region between 20 and70, I set up the equation to find when E1 (right) equals E2 (left):

1/(x-20)^2 =4/(70-x)^2 

Wait, taking square roots:

sqrt(1/(x-20)^2) = sqrt(4/(70-x)^2)

Which is 1/(x-20) = 2/(70-x)

So 70 -x = 2(x-20)

70 -x = 2x -40

70 +40 = 3x

110=3x → x= 110/3 ≈36.666 cm.

But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the correct solution is x=-30 cm, which is option C. But wait, the question says "other than at infinity", which is fine, but are there two solutions? Because I found x=-30 and x≈36.67 cm.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the direction for the middle region. Let me think again.

Wait, in the middle region, the field from q1 (positive) points to the right, and the field from q2 (negative) points to the left. So yes, their fields are opposing. So the point where E1 = E2 in magnitude would be a point where the net field is zero.

So, according to the calculation, x≈36.67 cm. But that's not one of the options. The given options are A:10, B:80, C:-30, D:-50, E:40, F:30, G:50, H:-20, I:90, J:60.

Hmm, 36.67 is closest to 30 or 40. But it's not exact. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the setup for the middle region.

Wait, in the middle region, the field from q1 is to the right, and the field from q2 is to the left. So the net field is zero when E1 equals E2 in magnitude, but opposite in direction.

So the equation is E1 = E2, but I think I might have mixed up the signs.

Wait, E1 is to the right, so positive direction, E2 is to the left, negative. So E_net = E1 - E2 = 0 → E1 = E2.

So that's correct.

Hmm, but the calculation gave x=110/3 cm ≈36.666 cm, which is 36.666... but none of the options match. So perhaps this is a miscalculation.

Wait, wait. Let me check the algebra again.

From the equation:

1/(x-20) = 2/(70 -x )

Multiply both sides by (x-20)(70-x):

70 -x = 2(x-20)

70 -x = 2x -40

Bring all terms to left:

70 -x -2x +40=0 → 110 -3x=0 → 3x=110 →x=110/3=36.666... cm.

Yes, that's correct. So why isn't this one of the options? Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:10 cm

B:80

C:-30

D:-50

E:40

F:30

G:50

H:-20

I:90

J:60.

So, 36.67 isn't present, but E is 40, F is 30.

But perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the problem. Let me try the same approach again.

Wait, perhaps I should define the distance as absolute values because when taking square roots, sometimes negative distances can come into play, but in this case, x is between 20 and70, so x-20 is positive, 70-x is positive. So the equation seems correct.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should consider the direction in terms of vectors. Let me model the electric fields as vectors.

Let me assume the point is at x, and the electric fields are vectors. So:

E_net = E1 (to the right) + E2 (to the left) =0.

So, E1 = E2.

E1 = k q1 / (x-20)^2 (to the right, so positive)

E2 = k |q2| / (70 -x)^2 (to the left, so negative)

So E_net = E1 - E2 =0 → E1 = E2.

Which gives the same equation as before.

So same solution. So x=36.666 cm is the solution in the middle region.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, let me look back at the problem statement. Oh wait, the problem says "other than at infinity". So perhaps there are two possible points where the field is zero: one to the left of q1, and one between q1 and q2.

But according to the options, only x=-30 cm is present. So perhaps I should re-ex
