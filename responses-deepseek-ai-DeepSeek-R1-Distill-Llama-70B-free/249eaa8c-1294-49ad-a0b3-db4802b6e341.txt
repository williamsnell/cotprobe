Question:

Which of the following is not true with regard to contingency tables for chi-square tests for independence?

B: Expected frequencies should be whole numbers.
C: Contingency tables are not required for chi-square tests for independence.
D: Observed frequencies should be whole numbers.
E: The categories are not numerical for either variable.

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contingency tables and chi-square tests for independence. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking which statement is not true regarding contingency tables for chi-square tests of independence. The options are A through E. Let's go through each one.

First, I remember that contingency tables are used to display the observed frequencies of data in categorical variables. Chi-square tests are used to determine if there's an association between these variables. So, what's the setup for these tests?

Option A: "Expected frequencies in each cell should be at least 5, and to achieve this, one sometimes combines categories for one or the other or both of the variables." I think this is correct. I recall that in chi-square tests, each cell's expected frequency should be at least 5. If they're too low, the approximation might not be valid. So, combining categories is a common solution to meet this requirement.

Option B: "Expected frequencies should be whole numbers." That makes sense because expected frequencies are calculated based on marginal totals, and they represent counts, which are whole numbers. So B sounds correct.

Option C: "Contingency tables are not required for chi-square tests for independence." Wait, I thought contingency tables are a fundamental part of these tests. The chi-square test is applied to the observed data in the table to compare against the expected frequencies. If you don't have a contingency table, how would you run the test? So C is probably not true, meaning it's the incorrect statement. But wait, let me check the other options before jumping to conclusions.

Option D: "Observed frequencies should be whole numbers." Of course, because you can't have a fraction of an observation. The data counts are always whole numbers, so D is definitely correct.

Option E: "The categories are not numerical for either variable." Chi-square tests for independence are used for categorical (nominal) data, not numerical. So E is correct because both variables should be categorical, not numerical.

So, circling back to option C. The statement says contingency tables are not required, which doesn't seem right. I thought they were essential because the test relies on comparing observed vs expected frequencies in each cell. Without a contingency table, you wouldn't have the structure to calculate these frequencies.

Wait, but maybe there's a case where another method is used without a contingency table? I'm trying to remember. Oh, wait, maybe some tests use other representations, but for the standard chi-square test of independence, the contingency table is necessary. So option C is incorrect because it claims that contingency tables are not required, which is false.

So the question is asking which is NOT true. So the false statement is option C. Therefore, option C is the correct answer to the question.

To determine which statement is not true regarding contingency tables for chi-square tests for independence, let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: This is true. In chi-square tests, expected frequencies in each cell should ideally be at least 5. If they are not, categories are often combined to meet this requirement.

- **Option B**: This is true. Expected frequencies are calculated as whole numbers because they represent counts.

- **Option C**: This is false. Contingency tables are essential for chi-square tests for independence, as they provide the structure to compare observed and expected frequencies.

- **Option D**: This is true. Observed frequencies are always whole numbers because they represent actual counts of data.

- **Option E**: This is true. Chi-square tests for independence are used for categorical data, not numerical data.

The statement that is not true is **Option C**, as contingency tables are required for chi-square tests for independence.

Answer: C
