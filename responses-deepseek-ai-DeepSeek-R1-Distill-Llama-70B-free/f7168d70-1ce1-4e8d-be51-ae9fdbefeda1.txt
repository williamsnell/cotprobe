Okay, so I have this problem about finding the input impedance of a transmission line. Hmm, I remember that transmission line theory can be a bit tricky, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says it's a 50-ohm line, and it's terminated in +j50 ohms. Oh right, that's a purely reactive load, specifically a capacitor or an inductor. Wait, +j50 would be an inductive reactance because impedance is R + jX, and for inductors X is positive.

The line length is such that βd equals π radians. Oh wait, β is the phase constant, right? And the phase constant β is (2π/λ), so when βd = π, that means d = λ/2, because β*d = (2π/λ)*(λ/2) )= π. So the line is λ/2 long.

I think the formula for the input impedance of a transmission line is Zin = Z0 * (ZL + j Z0 tan(βd)) / (Z0 + j ZL tan(βd)). Or wait, maybe I have the formula backwards. Oh wait, no, the standard formula is Zin = Z0 * [ (ZL + j Z0 tan(βd)) ] / [ Z0 + j ZL tan(βd) ) ].

Wait, another approach: when the transmission line has a length that's a multiple of a quarter wavelength or half wavelength, there are simplifications. Oh right, because at certain lengths, like λ/4 or λ/2, the behavior changes.

Since the line is λ/2 long, and βd is π, then tan(βd) is tan(π) which is 0. So tan(βd) is zero because tan of π is zero. Oh that's a relief because that simplifies the equation.

So substituting tan(βd) = 0 into the input impedance formula:

Zin = Z0 * [ ZL + j Z0 * 0 ] / [ Z0 + j ZL * 0 ]

Which simplifies to Zin = Z0 * ZL / Z0. Because the numerator becomes ZL, denominator becomes Z0. So ZL is 50 ohms, and Z0 is 50 ohms.

Wait, ZL is the load impedance, which is +j50 ohms. Oh, right, so ZL is j50.

So Zin = (50 ohms) * (j50 ohms) / (50 ohms). Oh wait, the 50s cancel. So that gives Zin = j50 ohms.

Wait wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when the line is λ/2 long, the impedance repeats. Oh wait, I remember that for a half-wavelength line, the input impedance equals the load impedance. Because the line acts like it's not there except for a phase shift, which doesn't affect impedance magnitude when the line is lossless and matched in a certain way.

Wait wait, let me think again. Oh wait, for a lossless line, when the length is an integer multiple of half-wavelengths (like λ/2, λ, 3λ/2, etc.), the line's input impedance is equal to the load impedance. Because the phase change over λ/2 is π radians, which would invert the impedance in a certain way, but wait, only for certain conditions.

Wait, no, more accurately, for a line of length d where βd = mπ (m is an integer), then the input impedance Zin is equal to ZL. Because the exponential terms become 1 or -1. Let me think about this.

The general formula for Zin is Z0 * (ZL + j Z0 tan(βd)) / (Z0 + j ZL tan(βd)).

When βd = mπ, tan(βd) = 0, so Zin = Z0 * ZL / (Z0) )= ZL. So yeah, the input impedance is just ZL.

Wait wait but in this case, ZL is j50. So Zin would be j50 ohms. So looking at the options, option J is j50 ohms. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check.

Wait, another way to think about it: when the length is λ/2, the input impedance is the same as the load impedance. So if load is j50, input is j50. So the answer should be option J. But wait, wait, let me make sure I remember correctly. Because sometimes, in some textbooks, the effect of the line length is considered with e^(jβd) terms, and for d=λ/2, it's e^(jπ) which is -1.

Wait, but in the Zin formula, when the line is a multiple of λ/2, the input impedance equals the load impedance. Because the reflection is such that the line doesn't affect the impedance, except for possibly a sign change, but in magnitude it's same. Wait, but if the line is lossless, then for d=λ/2, the input impedance is the same as ZL, including the phase. So if ZL is j50, then Zin is j50.

So looking at the options, option J is j50, which is correct.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, when the line is λ/2 long, the input impedance is Z0 squared divided by ZL. Wait, no, that's for a quarter wavelength transformer. For a quarter wavelength line, the input impedance is Z0^2 / ZL. But that's when βd is π/2, i.e., λ/4. So for λ/4 line, it's a impedance transformer.

But here, for βd=π (λ/2), the input impedance is ZL. So in this case, Zin = ZL = j50, so option J.

But wait, looking back at the answer options, let me check: option J is j50 ohms. So that's the correct answer.

To find the input impedance of a 50-ohm transmission line terminated in a load impedance of \( +j50 \, \Omega \), with a line length such that \( \beta d = \pi \) radians, we use the formula for the input impedance of a transmission line:

\[
Z_{\text{in}} = Z_0 \frac{Z_L + j Z_0 \tan(\beta d)}{Z_0 + j Z_L \tan(\beta d)}
\]

Here:
- \( Z_0 = 50 \, \Omega \) (characteristic impedance of the line),
- \( Z_L = +j50 \, \Omega \) (load impedance),
- \( \beta d = \pi \), so \( \tan(\beta d) = \tan(\pi) = 0 \).

Substituting \( \tan(\beta d) = 0 \) into the formula simplifies it to:

\[
Z_{\text{in}} = Z_0 \frac{Z_L}{Z_0}
\]

Since \( Z_0 = 50 \, \Omega \) and \( Z_L = +j50 \, \Omega \), the input impedance becomes:

\[
Z_{\text{in}} = Z_L = +j50 \, \Omega
\]

This result aligns with the property that for a transmission line of length \( \beta d = m\pi \) (where \( m \) is an integer), the input impedance equals the load impedance, including its reactive component.

From the given options:
- Option J corresponds to \( j50 \, \Omega \), which matches the calculated input impedance.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J: \( j50 \, \Omega \)**
