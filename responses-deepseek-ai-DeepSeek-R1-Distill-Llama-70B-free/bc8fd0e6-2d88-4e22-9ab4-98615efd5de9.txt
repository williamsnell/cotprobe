Okay, so I have this insurance question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about how much Mr. and Mrs. Tobin would have saved on their car insurance premium if they had no accidents in the past three years. 

First, I need to understand the information given. They have a car insurance policy with specific coverage: 50-and-100 bodily injury, $10,000 property damage, and $2,000 medical payments. They've had three accidents in the last three years and their car is kept in 02 territory. The question is asking how much they would have saved this year if they had no accidents.

Wait, I'm not sure what "02 territory" means. Maybe it's a typo, like a ZIP code or area code? Probably refers to their location, which affects insurance rates. But since the question focuses on accidents, maybe the location factor is constant and doesn't change the calculation here.

Now, the key point is about accidents and how they affect premiums. Typically, when you have accidents, especially if you're at fault, your insurance premiums can increase. This is often because insurance companies view you as a higher risk. So having multiple accidents in a short period (three in three years) would likely lead to higher premiums.

So, the Tobins have had three accidents. If they had none, their premiums would be lower. The question is by how much. But wait, the options are given, and I don't have specific numbers about how much each accident affects the premium. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I'm missing some standard rate increases for accidents.

I remember that insurance companies often apply surcharges for accidents. For example, the first accident might increase the premium by a certain percentage, and each subsequent accident could add more. Alternatively, there might be a fixed amount added per accident.

Let me think. I've heard that sometimes each accident can increase your premium by a certain amount. Let's say, for example, each accident adds $50 to the premium. If they had three, that's $150 extra. But if they had none, they'd save that $150. But looking at the options, $150 isn't an option. The closest is option F ($195), but that's higher.

Wait, maybe the surcharge increases with each accident. Like the first accident adds $50, the second $70, and the third $75. That would total $195, which is option F. But I'm not sure if that's how it works. Alternatively, maybe each accident adds a percentage of the base premium.

Another approach: Perhaps the base premium without any accidents is a certain amount, and each accident adds a surcharge. Let's say the base premium is, say, $800 a year. If they have three accidents, each adding, say, 25% each, that would be 3 * $200 = $600, making the total $1400. Without accidents, it would be $800, so the saving is $600. But $600 isn't among the options either.

Wait, maybe the surcharge is a fixed amount per accident. Let's say each accident adds $50. Three accidents would add $150, so without them, they save $150. But again, $150 isn't an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the first accident adds $75, the second $100, and the third $120. That totals $295. But that's not an option either. The closest is option G ($310) or C ($375). Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the surcharge is calculated differently. Maybe it's based on the coverage limits. They have 50/100 bodily injury, which is $50k per person and $100k per accident. Maybe the surcharge is a percentage of that. Or perhaps the surcharge is a flat rate per accident, like $50 each, totaling $150 for three.

But again, the options don't have $150. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about how insurance points work. In many states, each accident or violation adds points to your driving record, which increases your premium. For each point, the insurance goes up by a certain amount.

Suppose each accident adds two points, and each point increases the premium by, say, $30. So three accidents would be 6 points, leading to an increase of 6 * $30 = $180. Without accidents, they'd save $180. But again, $180 isn't an option. The closest is option F ($195) or H ($220).

Alternatively, if each accident adds three points, and each point is $25, then 3 accidents * 3 points = 9 points. 9 * $25 = $225. That's close to option H ($220). But not exact.

Wait, maybe the surcharge is a percentage increase. For instance, each accident could increase the premium by 10%. So if the base premium is $1000, one accident makes it $1100, the second $1210, the third $1331. So their premium with three accidents is $1331. Without any, it's $1000, so the saving is $331. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the increase is a flat rate per accident. Let's say each accident adds $65. Three accidents would add $195, which is option F. So if without accidents, they save $195.

Looking at the options, option F is $195. That would make sense if each accident adds $65. Alternatively, maybe the first accident adds $50, second $60, third $85, totaling $195.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: perhaps the insurance company applies a surcharge based on the number of claims, not just accidents. But the question says they had three accidents, so maybe each accident is considered a claim, leading to a surcharge.

Alternatively, maybe the Tobins are in a higher tier because of the accidents. Without accidents, they'd be in a better tier with lower premiums. For example, if their current premium is $1000, and without accidents, it's $805, the saving is $195. So option F.

Wait, but how do I get the exact number without more data? The question doesn't provide the base premium or the exact surcharge per accident. So perhaps I'm supposed to know an average surcharge per accident.

Upon reflection, I think that each at-fault accident can increase premiums by approximately 30% on average, but this varies. However, if they had three accidents, the surcharge might be higher each time. But without knowing the base premium, it's hard to calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a specific known surcharge. For example, some companies charge $200 per accident. Three accidents would be $600 extra. Without that, saving $600. But again, $600 isn't an option.

Wait, maybe the question is simpler. Maybe the answer is E: $85. But I'm not sure why that would be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the saving is based on the medical payments coverage. They have $2,000. But I don't see how that relates.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the fact that with three accidents, their premium includes a surcharge, and without, it's lower. So if, for example, each accident adds $50, three would be $150. But the options have F as $195. Maybe each accident adds $65.

Alternatively, perhaps the saving is calculated based on the coverage limits. Their BI is 50/100, PD is 10k, and MP is 2k. Maybe the surcharge is a percentage of these. But I'm not sure.

I'm a bit stuck here. Since the question is multiple choice and I don't have exact numbers, I have to make an educated guess. Given the options, I think the intended answer is F: $195, assuming each accident adds about $65 to the premium. So three accidents would add $195, which they would save if they had none.

The question involves determining how much Mr. and Mrs. Tobin would have saved on their car insurance premium if they had no accidents in the past three years. The key information provided is that they have had three accidents, which likely increased their premium due to surcharges applied by the insurance company. The exact surcharge per accident is not provided, but it is reasonable to assume that each accident adds a fixed amount to the premium.

Considering the options and typical insurance practices, it is plausible that each accident adds approximately $65 to the premium. Therefore, with three accidents, the total additional cost would be $195. If they had no accidents, they would save this amount.

Thus, the most reasonable answer, based on the given options and the assumption of a fixed surcharge per accident, is:

**F: $195**

Answer: F
