Okay, so I've got this integral to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because integrals can be tricky, especially when they involve trigonometric functions and infinite limits. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem is to find the value of (2/π) times the integral from 0 to infinity of [sin²(t)/t²] cos(2xt) dt, where x is sqrt(17)/17. Then I need to round the result to the hundredths place and pick the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, first, I should probably figure out what the integral part is. The integral looks a bit complex because it's an oscillatory function multiplied by a decaying function (since sin²(t)/t² goes to zero as t increases). I remember that integrals involving sin²(t) and cos terms might have some standard forms or known results.

Wait, I recall that the integral of sin²(t)/t² can be expressed in terms of the sine integral or cosine integral functions, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a Fourier transform approach here since we're dealing with an integral over all positive t, which is like a Fourier transform scenario.

Another thought: I remember that sin²(t) can be rewritten using a double-angle identity. Yeah, sin²(t) is (1 - cos(2t))/2. So let me substitute that into the integral.

So the integral becomes the integral from 0 to infinity of [ (1 - cos(2t))/2 ] / t² * cos(2x t) dt. Let me write that out:

Integral from 0 to ∞ [ (1 - cos(2t))/(2t²) ) * cos(2x t) ] dt.

Hmm, that might make it easier. Let me factor out the 1/2:

(1/2) ∫₀^∞ [ (1 - cos(2t)) / t² ] cos(2x t) dt.

Now, I can split this into two integrals:

(1/2) [ ∫₀^∞ (1/t²) cos(2x t) dt - ∫₀^∞ (cos(2t)/t²) cos(2x t) dt ].

Wait, but I'm not sure about the convergence of these integrals. The 1/t² term might cause problems at t=0, but perhaps when combined with the cosine terms, the integrals converge.

I think I remember that integrals involving t^(-n) and oscillatory functions can sometimes be evaluated using differentiation under the integral sign or known Fourier transforms.

Another approach: Maybe use the fact that the Fourier transform of 1/t² isn't straightforward, but perhaps integrating by parts could help. Let me try integrating by parts.

Let me consider the first integral, ∫ (1/t²) cos(a t) dt from 0 to ∞, where a is 2x in the first term and 2 in the second.

Wait, integrating 1/t² * cos(a t) from 0 to ∞. Hmm, integrating by parts, let u = cos(a t), dv = (1/t²) dt. Then du = -a sin(a t) dt, and v = -1/t.

Integration by parts gives uv from 0 to ∞ minus ∫ v du. So:

[ -cos(a t)/t ] from 0 to ∞ + a ∫ sin(a t)/t dt.

Wait, evaluating the first term at the limits: as t approaches ∞, cos(a t) oscillates but 1/t goes to zero, so that term is zero. As t approaches 0, cos(a t) approaches 1, so 1/t goes to infinity. Wait, but that seems problematic. So perhaps this approach isn't working.

Wait, maybe I should consider whether the integral converges. The integral ∫ (1/t²) cos(a t) dt from 0 to ∞. Let's check the behavior near t=0 and t=∞.

Near t=0: cos(a t) ≈ 1 - (a² t²)/2, so 1/t² * cos(a t) ≈ 1/t² - a²/2. So the integrand behaves like 1/t² near zero, which is not integrable because the integral of 1/t² from 0 to any positive number is [ -1/t ] from 0 to something, which goes to infinity. So that integral diverges? That's a problem.

Wait, but in our original integral, we have (1 - cos(2t))/t². Let me expand that: (1 - cos(2t)) ~ (2t²) when t is near 0, because the Taylor series of cos(2t) is 1 - (2t)^2/2 + (2t)^4/24 - ... So 1 - cos(2t) ≈ (4t²)/2 = 2t². So (1 - cos(2t))/t² ≈ 2 as t approaches 0. So the function [1 - cos(2t)]/t² is actually finite as t approaches zero, which is good for convergence. So the integral of [1 - cos(2t)]/t² cos(2x t) dt from 0 to ∞ should converge.

So perhaps it's better to consider the integral as a whole rather than splitting it. Let me think about known integrals involving [1 - cos(a t)]/t².

Wait, I think I remember that ∫₀^∞ [1 - cos(a t)] / t² dt = π a / 2. Yes, that sounds familiar. But wait, that's without any other cosine terms. But in our case, we have an extra cos(2x t) term.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the convolution theorem or some Fourier transform properties. Let me consider that.

Wait, the integral we have is ∫₀^∞ [ (1 - cos(2t)) / t² ] cos(2x t) dt. Let me denote this as I.

So, I = ∫₀^∞ [ (1 - cos(2t)) / t² ] cos(2x t) dt.

Hmm, perhaps I can express this as the Fourier transform of [1 - cos(2t)]/t² evaluated at 2x. Let me recall that the Fourier transform of a function f(t) is F(k) = ∫_{-infty}^{infty} f(t) e^{-i k t} dt. But our integral is from 0 to ∞, and involves only cos terms, so perhaps it's the cosine transform.

Wait, alternatively, since the integrand is even, I can extend it to the entire real line. So I can write I as (1/2) ∫_{-infty}^infty [ (1 - cos(2t)) / t² ] cos(2x t) dt.

Because the function [1 - cos(2t)]/t² is even, so the integral from -infty to infty would be twice the integral from 0 to infty. So that's why I'm putting a 1/2 factor.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how to proceed. Maybe I should consider the Fourier transform of [1 - cos(2t)]/t². Alternatively, perhaps I can find the Fourier transform of 1/t² and cos(2t)/t² separately.

Wait, I think the Fourier transform of 1/t² might not be straightforward because 1/t² isn't a tempered distribution, but perhaps in the principal value sense.

Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts would help. Let me try that.

Let me let u = [1 - cos(2t)] and dv = cos(2x t)/t² dt.

Wait, integrating by parts, I get:

I = uv| from 0 to ∞ - ∫ v du.

Wait, but the choice of u and dv is crucial. Let me try that again.

Let me set u = 1 - cos(2t), so du/dt = 2 sin(2t).

Let dv = cos(2x t)/t² dt. Then v would be the integral of cos(2x t)/t² dt. Hmm, that might not be easy to compute.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider integrating by parts the other way. Let me set u = cos(2x t), so du/dt = -2x sin(2x t). And dv = [1 - cos(2t)]/t² dt. Then v would be the integral of [1 - cos(2t)]/t² dt.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to find v. The integral of [1 - cos(2t)]/t² dt. Let's see, integrating [1 - cos(2t)]/t² dt. Let me make a substitution: let u = 2t, so du = 2 dt, dt = du/2. Then the integral becomes ∫ [1 - cos(u)]/( (u/2) )² ) * (du/2).

Hmm, that might not help much. Alternatively, perhaps integrating by parts again. Let me try:

Let me set u1 = 1 - cos(2t), dv1 = dt/t².

Then du1 = 2 sin(2t) dt, and v1 = -1/t.

So, integrating [1 - cos(2t)]/t² dt = u1 v1 - ∫ v1 du1 = (1 - cos(2t)) (-1/t) - ∫ (-1/t) * 2 sin(2t) dt.

So that's (- (1 - cos(2t)) / t ) + 2 ∫ sin(2t)/t dt.

The integral ∫ sin(2t)/t dt is Si(2t), the sine integral function. So putting it together, the integral [1 - cos(2t)]/t² dt = - (1 - cos(2t))/t + 2 Si(2t) + C.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's helpful for the integration by parts in I. Let me go back to the original I:

I = ∫ [1 - cos(2t)]/t² cos(2x t) dt.

If I integrate by parts with u = [1 - cos(2t)] and dv = cos(2x t)/t² dt, then du = 2 sin(2t) dt, and v is the integral of cos(2x t)/t² dt, which I'm not sure about. Maybe this isn't the best approach.

Another idea: Maybe use the fact that the integral involves the product of two cosine functions, so I can use a product-to-sum identity. Let me try that.

The product cos(A) cos(B) is [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] / 2.

So, [1 - cos(2t)] cos(2x t) = [1 * cos(2x t) - cos(2t) cos(2x t)].

So, 1 * cos(2x t) is cos(2x t), and cos(2t) cos(2x t) is [cos(2(t + x t)) + cos(2(t - x t))]/2? Wait, no, the identity is cos a cos b = [cos(a+b) + cos(a-b)]/2.

So, cos(2t) cos(2x t) = [cos(2t + 2x t) + cos(2t - 2x t)] / 2.

Wait, that is [cos(2(1 + x) t) + cos(2(1 - x) t)] / 2.

So, putting it all together:

[1 - cos(2t)] cos(2x t) = cos(2x t) - [cos(2(1 + x) t) + cos(2(1 - x) t)] / 2.

So, our integral I becomes:

(1/2) ∫₀^∞ [cos(2x t) - (cos(2(1+x) t) + cos(2(1 - x) t))/2 ] / t² dt.

Wait, I think I might have messed up the substitution. Let me re-express the integral correctly.

Wait, no, earlier I had:

I = (1/2) [ ∫ (1/t²) cos(2x t) dt - ∫ (cos(2t)/t²) cos(2x t) dt ].

Then, for the second integral, I applied the product-to-sum formula:

cos(2t) cos(2x t) = [cos(2(1+x) t) + cos(2(1 - x) t)] / 2.

So the second integral becomes ∫ cos(2t)/t² cos(2x t) dt = (1/2) ∫ [cos(2(1+x)t) + cos(2(1 - x)t)] / t² dt.

So, putting it all together, I is:

I = (1/2) [ ∫ (cos(2x t))/t² dt - (1/2) ∫ [cos(2(1+x)t) + cos(2(1 - x)t)] / t² dt ].

So, I = (1/2) [ ∫ cos(2x t)/t² dt - (1/2)( ∫ cos(2(1+x) t)/t² dt + ∫ cos(2(1 - x) t)/t² dt ) ].

Hmm, but each of these integrals ∫ cos(a t)/t² dt from 0 to ∞. Earlier, I thought about whether this converges. Wait, earlier when I considered ∫ (1/t²) cos(a t) dt, I saw that near t=0, cos(a t) ~ 1, so 1/t² is not integrable, but in our original problem, the integrand was [1 - cos(2t)]/t², which is finite at t=0.

Wait, but in this approach, I split the integral into parts where each integral has 1/t² multiplied by cosine terms, which might not converge individually.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe I should find another way.

Wait, another idea: I remember that the integral ∫₀^∞ [1 - cos(a t)] / t² dt = (π a)/2. Let me verify that.

Yes, I think that's correct. So, ∫₀^∞ (1 - cos(a t)) / t² dt = (π a)/2.

But in our problem, we have an extra cos(2x t) term. So perhaps we can consider that as the Fourier transform of [1 - cos(2t)]/t².

Wait, let me think about Fourier transforms. The Fourier transform of a function f(t) is F(k) = ∫_{-infty}^infty f(t) e^{-i k t} dt. But our integral is from 0 to ∞, and involves cos(2x t), which relates to the real part of the Fourier transform.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of the Fourier cosine transform, since our function is even.

The Fourier cosine transform of f(t) is defined as F_c(k) = ∫₀^∞ f(t) cos(k t) dt. So, in our case, [1 - cos(2t)]/t² is the function, and we're evaluating its Fourier cosine transform at k = 2x.

So, our integral I is exactly the Fourier cosine transform of [1 - cos(2t)]/t² evaluated at k = 2x.

Hmm, if I can find the Fourier cosine transform of [1 - cos(2t)]/t², that would solve the problem.

I recall that the Fourier cosine transform of t^(-ν) is related to certain gamma functions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the Fourier transform of [1 - cos(2t)]/t² by relating it to known transforms.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that [1 - cos(2t)]/t² is the second derivative of some function. Let me think about integrating factors.

Wait, maybe I can express [1 - cos(2t)]/t² as the derivative of something. Let me see:

We know that d/dt [sin(2t)/(2t)] = [2t cos(2t) * 2t - sin(2t) * 2 ] / (2t^2) )? Wait, perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, let's compute the derivative of [sin(2t)/t]:

d/dt [sin(2t)/t] = (2 cos(2t) * t - sin(2t)) / t².

Hmm, that's 2t cos(2t)/t² - sin(2t)/t² = 2 cos(2t)/t - sin(2t)/t².

Not quite what we have, but maybe integrating that.

Alternatively, perhaps taking the second derivative of something.

Wait, perhaps I can write [1 - cos(2t)]/t² as the second derivative of a function. Let me see.

We know that the first derivative of sin(2t)/t is [2t cos(2t) - sin(2t)] / t² = 2 cos(2t)/t - sin(2t)/t².

Then, taking the derivative of that:

d/dt [2 cos(2t)/t - sin(2t)/t² ].

Let's compute each term:

d/dt [2 cos(2t)/t] = 2 [ -2 sin(2t) * t - cos(2t) ] / t² = [ -4 t sin(2t) - 2 cos(2t) ] / t².

d/dt [ - sin(2t)/t² ] = - [ 2 cos(2t) * t² - sin(2t) * 2t ] / t^4 = - [ 2 t² cos(2t) - 2 t sin(2t) ] / t^4 = - [ 2 cos(2t) - 2 sin(2t)/t ] / t².

So adding these together, the derivative is:

[ -4 t sin(2t) - 2 cos(2t) ] / t² - [ 2 cos(2t) - 2 sin(2t)/t ] / t².

Hmm, that seems complicated, but maybe there's a pattern here. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider integrating [1 - cos(2t)]/t² in terms of known integrals.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that ∫₀^∞ [1 - cos(a t)]/t² dt = (π a)/2,
