Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because balancing equations can be tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that a red signal flare is made by mixing strontium nitrate, carbon, and sulfur. The chemical equation provided is 2Sr(NO3)2 + 3C + 2S → ... and we need to complete and balance it. Also, it mentions that no atmospheric oxygen is necessary, so all the oxygen must come from the compounds involved.

First, I should probably figure out what the products are. Strontium nitrate is Sr(NO3)2. When it decomposes, especially in reactions with C and S, which are probably acting as reducing agents, I think the products might include strontium oxide (SrO), some form of nitrogen gas (like N2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). But I'm not 100% sure, so let me think.

So the reactants are Sr(NO3)2, C, and S. The products likely involve SrO because when nitrates decompose, they often form metal oxides. Then, the nitrate (NO3^-) would probably form N2 since that's a common product in decomposition reactions, especially with reducing agents like C and S. Carbon reacting with oxygen typically forms CO2, and sulfur with oxygen forms SO2.

So the products should be SrO, N2, CO2, and SO2. Now, I need to write the equation with these products and balance it.

The unbalanced equation would look something like:

2 Sr(NO3)2 + 3 C + 2 S → SrO + N2 + CO2 + SO2.

Now, I need to balance each element. Let's list out the elements involved: Sr, N, O (from nitrate), C, S.

Starting with Sr: On the left, there are 2 Sr atoms. So the product side must have 2 SrO. So I'll write 2 SrO.

Nitrogen: Each Sr(NO3)2 has 2 nitrate ions, so 2 molecules means 4 nitrates. Each nitrate is NO3, so 4 NO3 groups. Each NO3 has one N, so 4 N total. The product is N2 gas, which is diatomic. So to get 4 N, we'll need 2 molecules of N2 (because each has 2 N). So 2 N2.

Carbon: There are 3 C on the left. The product is CO2, so each CO2 has one C. So we need 3 CO2 to account for all 3 C atoms.

Sulfur: There are 2 S on the left. The product is SO2. Each SO2 has one S, so we'll need 2 SO2 molecules.

Now, let's count the oxygens because that's where it might get tricky. The nitrate groups have a lot of O.

Each Sr(NO3)2 has 2 nitrate ions, each with 3 O, so 2 * 3 * 2 (since there are 2 Sr(NO3)2 molecules) = 12 O. Plus, the C and S on the left don't contribute O because they're elemental. So total O on the left is 12.

On the product side:

SrO: Each has 1 O. 2 SrO gives 2 O.
CO2: Each has 2 O. 3 CO2 gives 6 O.
SO2: Each has 2 O. 2 SO2 gives 4 O.
N2 doesn't have O.

So total O on the right is 2 + 6 + 4 = 12 O. Oh, that matches the O on the left. So the O is balanced.

Let me check each element again:

Sr: 2 on both sides.
N: 4 on left (from 2 Sr(NO3)2 → 4 NO3^- → 4 N). On right, 2 N2 → 4 N. So balanced.
C: 3 on left, 3 CO2 → 3 C. Balanced.
S: 2 on left, 2 SO2 → 2 S. Balanced.
O: 12 on both sides. Balanced.

So the balanced equation is:

2 Sr(NO3)2 + 3 C + 2 S → 2 SrO + 2 N2 + 3 CO2 + 2 SO2.

Now, looking at the options:

Option I says: 2SrO + 2N_2 + 3CO_2 + 2SO_2.

Which matches exactly what I have. So the correct answer should be option I.

To balance the given chemical equation for the reaction involving strontium nitrate (Sr(NO₃)₂), carbon (C), and sulfur (S), we first identify the products. Strontium nitrate likely decomposes into strontium oxide (SrO) and nitrogen gas (N₂), while carbon and sulfur react to form carbon dioxide (CO₂) and sulfur dioxide (SO₂), respectively. The unbalanced equation is:

\[
2 \, \text{Sr(NO₃)₂} + 3 \, \text{C} + 2 \, \text{S} \rightarrow \text{SrO} + \text{N₂} + \text{CO₂} + \text{SO₂}.
\]

### Balancing the Equation:
1. **Strontium (Sr):** There are 2 Sr atoms on the left, so the product side must include 2 SrO.
2. **Nitrogen (N):** Each Sr(NO₃)₂ contains 2 nitrate ions (NO₃⁻), and there are 2 Sr(NO₃)₂ molecules, giving a total of 4 NO₃ groups. Each NO₃ group contains 1 N atom, so there are 4 N atoms on the left. Since nitrogen forms N₂ gas, 2 molecules of N₂ are needed to account for all 4 N atoms.
3. **Carbon (C):** There are 3 C atoms on the left, so the product side must include 3 CO₂ molecules.
4. **Sulfur (S):** There are 2 S atoms on the left, so the product side must include 2 SO₂ molecules.
5. **Oxygen (O):** The total oxygen on the left comes from the nitrate groups: 2 Sr(NO₃)₂ provides \(2 \times 2 \times 3 = 12\) O atoms. On the right, the oxygen atoms in SrO, CO₂, and SO₂ sum to \(2 + (3 \times 2) + (2 \times 2) = 12\), matching the oxygen on the left.

The balanced equation is:

\[
2 \, \text{Sr(NO₃)₂} + 3 \, \text{C} + 2 \, \text{S} \rightarrow 2 \, \text{SrO} + 2 \, \text{N₂} + 3 \, \text{CO₂} + 2 \, \text{SO₂}.
\]

### Matching with the Options:
The correct option is **I**, as it matches the balanced equation:

\[
\text{I: } 2 \, \text{SrO} + 2 \, \text{N₂} + 3 \, \text{CO₂} + 2 \, \text{SO₂}.
\]
