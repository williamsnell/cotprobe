Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric circuits. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the current flowing through a coil connected to a cell, considering the cell's internal resistance in two different scenarios.

Alright, let's read the question again. The coil has a resistance of 0.05 ohms. The cell's electromotive force (emf) is 1.5 volts. The internal resistance of the cell is given as 0.1 ohm in part (a) and 0.01 ohm in part (b). I need to find the current in each case.

Wait, I remember that when a cell with internal resistance is connected to an external resistor, the total resistance in the circuit is the sum of the internal resistance and the external resistor. Oh right, because resistors in series add up. So the total resistance R_total is r_internal + R_external.

And the current I can be found using Ohm's Law: I = emf / R_total. Oh right, because the actual voltage available to drive the current through the external resistor is the emf minus the voltage drop in the internal resistance. But using the formula I = emf / (r + R) is the same thing.

So for part (a), the internal resistance is 0.1 ohms. The external resistor is 0.05 ohms. So R_total = 0.1 + 0.05 = 0.15 ohms. Then I = 1.5 V / 0.15 ohms. Let's calculate that: 1.5 divided by 0.15. Hmm, 0.15 times 10 is 1.5, so 1.5 / 0.15 is 10. So the current is 10 amps in part (a).

Wait, but let me double-check that. Oh yes, because 0.15 ohms is 0.15, and 1.5 divided by 0.15 is indeed 10. So I think I'm right there.

Now part (b) has an internal resistance of 0.01 ohms. So R_total is 0.01 + 0.05 = 0.06 ohms. Then I = 1.5 / 0.06. Let me compute that. 0.06 times 25 is 1.5 because 0.06 times 10 is 0.6, times 20 is 1.2, plus 0.06 times 5 is 0.3. So 1.2 + 0.3 is 1.5. So 25. So current is 25 amps.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to make sure. Let me look at the options. Option E says (a) 5 amp, (b) 20 amp. No, that's opposite. Option J is (a)10, (b)25. Oh yes, that's the one I got. So J seems to be the correct choice.

But wait, let me check if I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate part (a):

1.5 V divided by (0.1 + 0.05) = 1.5 / 0.15. 0.15 goes into 1.5 ten times because 0.15 * 10 = 1.5. Yes, that's correct. So part (a) is 10 A.

Part (b): 1.5 / (0.01 + 0.05) = 1.5 / 0.06. Let's compute 0.06 times 25. 25 * 0.06 is 1.50, so yes, 25 A.

So the correct option is J: (a)10, (b)25. Looking back at the options, option J is (a)10, (b)25. So the answer should be J.

To solve the problem, we use Ohm's Law in the context of a circuit with an external resistor and the cell's internal resistance. The total resistance in the circuit is the sum of the external resistance and the internal resistance:  

\[
R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{external}} + r_{\text{internal}}
\]

The current \( I \) is then given by:  

\[
I = \frac{\text{emf}}{R_{\text{total}}}
\]

### Part (a):  
- External resistance \( R_{\text{external}} = 0.05 \, \Omega \)  
- Internal resistance \( r_{\text{internal}} = 0.1 \, \Omega \)  
- Total resistance:  
  \[
  R_{\text{total}} = 0.05 + 0.1 = 0.15 \, \Omega
  \]  
- Current:  
  \[
  I = \frac{1.5}{0.15} = 10 \, \text{A}
  \]

### Part (b):  
- External resistance \( R_{\text{external}} = 0.05 \, \Omega \)  
- Internal resistance \( r_{\text{internal}} = 0.01 \, \Omega \)  
- Total resistance:  
  \[
  R_{\text{total}} = 0.05 + 0.01 = 0.06 \, \Omega
  \]  
- Current:  
  \[
  I = \frac{1.5}{0.06} = 25 \, \text{A}
  \]

### Final Answer:  
From the calculations, the current in part (a) is \( 10 \, \text{A} \), and in part (b) it is \( 25 \, \text{A} \). Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct choice is **J**.
