Question:

A pipe is cooled internally by forced convection from the flow of a non-Newtonian fluid. The pipe is 5 ft. long, with a diameter of 1 in. The flow is measured at 600Ibm/hr, and the wall surface temperature is 200°F. Assume it is a laminar flow of a power-law fluid. Physical and flow properties are: \rho = 65lbm/ft^3c_p = 0.5 Btu/lbm-°F k = 0.7 Btu/hr-ft-°F n = n' = 0.4 (constant) K = 94 lbm-sec^n-2/ft at 100°F = 42 lbm-sec^n-2/ft at 200°F A plot of log K vs. T°F is a straight line. If the fluid enters the section at 100°F, at what temperature does it leave?

Okay, so I've got this problem about a pipe being cooled by a non-Newtonian fluid. Hmm, non-Newtonian... right, that means the viscosity isn't constant and depends on the shear rate. The problem gives a bunch of data, and I need to find the exit temperature of the fluid.

First, let me list out what's given. The pipe is 5 ft long with a diameter of 1 inch. The flow rate is 600 lbm/hr. The wall temperature is 200°F, and the fluid enters at 100°F. The fluid is a power-law type, so I remember that the constitutive equation is τ = K * (γ_dot)^n, where τ is shear stress, γ_dot is the shear rate, and K is the consistency index.

The physical properties: density (rho) is 65 lbm/ft³, specific heat (c_p) is 0.5 Btu/lbm-°F, thermal conductivity (k) is 0.7 Btu/hr-ft-°F. The flow behavior index n is 0.4, same as n', which probably relates to the power-law in the constitutive equation.

K is given at two temperatures: 94 lbm-secⁿ-²/ft at 100°F and 42 at 200°F. Oh, and there's a straight-line plot between log K and T°F, so K varies with temperature, and we can maybe model it with an Arrhenius-type equation or a linear relation.

The question is, what's the exit temperature of the fluid?

I think I need to calculate the heat transfer from the pipe wall to the fluid. Since it's a cooling problem, the fluid will gain heat, so its temperature will rise. Wait, no—wait, the pipe is being cooled, so the fluid is losing heat. Or wait, the pipe is being cooled by the fluid. Oh wait, the pipe's wall is at a higher temperature (200°F) than the fluid's inlet (100°F), so heat is transferred from the pipe to the fluid. So the fluid is being heated. So the exit temperature will be higher than 100°F.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the pipe is cooled internally by the fluid. So the fluid is flowing through the pipe, and the pipe's wall is hotter than the fluid, so heat is conducted into the fluid, heating it up. So the fluid's temperature will increase as it flows through the pipe.

Wait, but the problem says the pipe is cooled by the convection. So the fluid must be at a lower temperature than the pipe wall. So heat flows from the pipe into the fluid, heating the fluid.

So the fluid's exit temperature is higher than 100°F. The options are from 100 up to 200, but the pipe wall is 200°F. So the fluid can't reach that, so the exit temp is somewhere between 100 and 200.

But how to calculate it. I think I need to find the heat transfer rate to the fluid and then use that to find the temperature change.

The approach probably involves calculating the heat transfer coefficient, then the heat flux, then the total heat transferred, then using the fluid's heat capacity to find the temperature rise.

But wait, for non-Newtonian fluids in laminar flow, the heat transfer calculations are a bit different than for Newtonian. I remember something about the Graetz number and the use of a modified version for power-law fluids.

Wait, I think the Graetz number is important here. The Graetz number (Gz) is used in laminar flow heat transfer, especially for situations where the flow is developing. The formula is Gz = (Re * Pr * D) / L, but I might be mixing up the exact formula.

Wait, no, the Graetz number is defined as Gz = (D/(L)) * (Re * Pr), maybe? Or I might have it backwards. Alternatively, I think the Graetz problem is about heat transfer in the entrance region of a pipe, and for a fully developed flow, the Nusselt number is constant.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think. For a Newtonian fluid in laminar flow, the Nusselt number for a circular tube with constant wall temperature is 3.66 for fully developed flow. But when flow is developing (like in the thermal entrance region), the Nusselt number varies along the length.

But since the pipe is 5 ft long, which is pretty long, maybe the flow is fully developed. But I'm not sure about that given the fluid's properties.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Sieder-Tate equation, which accounts for both developing and developed flow. The Sieder-Tate correlation is for laminar flow in tubes with constant wall temperature, and it's given by:

Nu = 1.86 * (Re * Pr * D/L)^(1/3) * (μ/μ_wall)^(0.14)

Wait, but for non-Newtonian fluids, the Reynolds number calculation is different. Because the Reynolds number for a power-law fluid is defined differently. I think the Reynolds number for a power-law fluid is Re = (rho * u^2-n * D^n) / K, where u is the average velocity.

Wait, let me get that right. For a power-law fluid, the generalized Reynolds number is Re = (rho * (8 V_avg / (3n+1))^(n) * D^{n} ) / K) * (3n+1)/(4n)^n ?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the steps needed.

First, calculate the average velocity of the fluid in the pipe. The mass flow rate is 600 lbm/hr. The density is 65 lbm/ft³. The cross-sectional area is pi*(d/2)^2. Let me compute that.

The pipe diameter is 1 inch, which is 1/12 ft. So radius is 1/(24) ft.

Area A = pi * (1/24)^2 = pi * 1/(576) ≈ 0.00545 ft².

Mass flow rate m_dot is 600 lbm/hr. So the velocity v_avg is m_dot / (rho * A).

Wait, m_dot = rho * A * v_avg => v_avg = m_dot / (rho * A).

Plugging in the numbers:

m_dot = 600 lbm/hr. Let me convert units to ft², etc.

Wait, rho is 65 lbm/ft³, A is 0.00545 ft².

So v_avg = 600 lbm/hr / (65 lbm/ft³ * 0.00545 ft²)

But wait, units: lbm/hr divided by (lbm/ft³ * ft²) gives (1/hr) * ft³/(lbm ft²) ) * lbm → (ft³/(ft²)) ) * 1/hr → ft/(hr).

But I might need to convert to ft/s or something else, but perhaps it's manageable.

Wait, 600 / (65 * 0.00545) = 600 / (0.35325) ≈ 600 / 0.35325 ≈ approx 1699.57 lbm/(ft²·hr) ??? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the denominator is rho * A, which is lbm/ft³ * ft² = lbm/ft. So the numerator is lbm/hr, so (lbm/hr) / (lbm/ft) ) = (1/hr) * ft → ft/hr.

Wait, maybe I should compute it numerically.

Compute rho * A: 65 lbm/ft³ * 0.00545 ft² = 65 * 0.00545 = approx 0.35325 lbm/ft.

v_avg = m_dot / (rho * A) = (600 lbm/hr) / (0.35325 lbm/ft) ) → (600 / 0.35325) ft/hr.

600 / 0.35325 ≈ 1699.57 ft/hr. That's about 0.472 ft/s (since 1 ft/s is 3600 ft/hr).

Wait, but 1699.57 ft/hr divided by 3600 is approx 0.472 ft/s.

Now, I need to find the Reynolds number for the power-law fluid. The generalized Reynolds number is Re = (rho * v_avg^(2-n) * D^n) / K.

Wait, let me make sure. For a power-law fluid, the Reynolds number is defined as Re = (rho * (8 V_avg / (3n +1 ))^n * D^(n-1) * D ) ) / (K ( (3n +1)/ (4n) )^n ) )

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct expression. Alternatively, another source says Re = (rho * V_avg^2 * D) / (K V_avg^n D^(n-1)) ) ) → simplifies to (rho V_avg^{2-n} D^{2 -n} ) / K.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The general form for the Reynolds number in power-law fluids is Re = (rho * (8 V_avg) )^n * D^{n+1} / (K (3n +1)^(n+1) )) ) × something. Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe it's better to use the Metzner and Reed Reynolds number, which is Re = (rho * V_avg^2 * D) / (K (8 V_avg/D)^n ) )

Wait, perhaps I can look up the formula. For a power-law fluid, the Reynolds number is Re = (rho * D^ (n+1) * V_avg^n ) / (K * 8^n ) )

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to refer to the expression for the Reynolds number for a power-law fluid.

The Reynolds number for a power-law fluid is defined as:

Re = (rho * V_avg^2 * D) / (K ( (3n + 1)/(4n) )^n * (8 V_avg/D) )^n )

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the apparent viscosity and then use the standard Reynolds number formula.

Wait, for a power-law fluid, the apparent viscosity μ_app is K (γ_dot)^{n-1}, where γ_dot is the shear rate. For a pipe flow, the shear rate at the wall is approximately 8 V_avg / D for a Newtonian fluid, but for a power-law fluid, the expression might differ. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Rabinowitsch-Moore equation, but that's getting into more complex territory.

Alternatively, perhaps the generalized Reynolds number for a power-law fluid is given by:

Re = (rho * D^n * V_avg^{2 -n} ) / K

Yes, I think that's the one I've seen before. So Re = (rho * D^n * V_avg^{2 -n} ) / K.

So, let me plug in the numbers. But wait, K depends on temperature. Since the fluid's temperature changes from 100°F to T_exit, I need to account for the variation of K with temperature.

The problem says that a plot of log K vs. T°F is a straight line. So K(T) can be determined from the two given points.

At T=100°F, K=94 lbm·sⁿ⁻²/ft.

At T=200°F, K=42 lbm·sⁿ⁻²/ft.

So I can model K(T) using a linear relation between log K and T.

Let me compute the slope of log K vs T.

Slope m = (log(42) - log(94)) / (200-100) = (log(42/94)) / 100.

42/94 ≈ 0.4474.

Log(0.4474) ≈ -0.3498.

So slope m = (-0.3498) / 100 = -0.003498 per °F.

Then, the equation is log(K) = log(K_at_100) + m*(T - 100).

log(K) = log(94) + (-0.003498)(T - 100).

log(94) is about 1.9731.

So, K(T) = 10^(1.9731 - 0.003498*(T-100)).

But wait, perhaps I can find K as a function of T using this equation.

But since the temperature of the fluid increases along the pipe, and K decreases with temperature, the viscosity decreases as the fluid heats up. Hmm, but wait, K is the consistency index, which for some non-Newtonian fluids might decrease with temperature, implying the fluid becomes less viscous at higher temperatures.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Maybe I can proceed by assuming that K is evaluated at the average temperature of the fluid. Alternatively, perhaps I can use an average K over the pipe length.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the K at the inlet temperature, compute the Reynolds number, find the heat transfer coefficient, and then find the exit temp. But that's an iterative process because the K depends on temperature, which depends on the heat transfer, which depends on K.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that K is constant, but given that K changes with temperature, I don't think that's the case. So maybe I should model the variation of K along the pipe.

Wait, perhaps I can model K as varying with the fluid temperature, which in turn affects the Reynolds number, Nusselt number, and thus the heat transfer coefficient. But this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can make an assumption that K is average over the temperature range.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the K at the inlet condition to compute everything, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem states that the fluid enters at 100°F. So perhaps the K is 94 lbm·sⁿ⁻²/ft at the inlet. But as the fluid heats up, K decreases. So, the average K in the pipe might be somewhere between 94 and 42, depending on the exit temp.

But without knowing the exit temp, I can't know the average K. So perhaps an iterative approach is needed.

But perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the temperature dependence of K, but that seems unlikely given the data provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the variation of K with T is not needed because the problem gives K at 100°F and 200°F, and the exit temp is somewhere in between. But I'm not sure how to proceed without more info.

Wait, perhaps I can proceed as follows:

1. Assume that the fluid's temperature is such that K can be approximated.

2. Compute the Reynolds number, then the Prandtl number, then the Nusselt number.

3. Use the Nusselt number to find the heat transfer coefficient.

4. Use the heat transfer coefficient and the pipe's surface area to find the heat transferred.

5. Use the heat transferred to find the temperature rise, and thus the exit temperature.

But perhaps I need to use an average K value.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that K is taken at the inlet condition, so K=94, and compute everything with that.

So let's try that approach.

So, compute Re using K=94.

Compute Re = (rho * D^n * V_avg^{2 -n}) / K.

Given:

rho = 65 lbm/ft³,

D = 1 inch = 1/12 ft,

n = 0.4,

V_avg = 1699.57 ft/hr.

Wait, but the units for V_avg are ft/hr. I need to convert this to ft/s perhaps.

V_avg = 1699.57 ft/hr = 1699.57 / 3600 ft/s ≈ 0.472 ft/s.

Wait, but let me check: 1 ft/hr is 1/(3600) ft/s. So, yes.

So, D = 1/12 ft,

V_avg = 0.472 ft/s.

So plug into Re formula:

Re = (65 lbm/ft³) * ( (1/12 ft)^0.4 ) * (0.472 ft/s)^{2 - 0.4} / 94 lbm·s^{0.4·n} ? Wait, no, units for K are lbm·sⁿ⁻²/ft. Wait, n is 0.4, so K has units lbm·s^{0.4 -2}/ft = lbm·s^{-1.6}/ft? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled in units.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the numerical value.

Compute D^n: (1/12)^0.4 ≈ (0.08333)^0.4.

Let me compute that:

ln(0.08333) ≈ -2.4887.

Multiply by 0.4: -0.9955.

Exponentiate: e^-0.9955 ≈ 0.370.

So D^0.4 ≈ 0.370.

V_avg^{2 -n} = (0.472)^{1.6}.

Compute 0.472^1.6:

Take natural log: ln(0.472) ≈ -0.751.

Multiply by 1.6: -1.2016.

Exponentiate: e^-1.2016 ≈ 0.300.

So V_avg^{1.6} ≈ 0.300.

Now, multiply all together:

Re = 65 * 0.370 * 0.300 / 94.

Compute numerator: 65 * 0.370 = 24.05; 24.05 * 0.3 ≈7.215.

Divide by 94: 7.215 /94 ≈ 0.0768.

So Re ≈ 0.0768.

Wait, that's a very low Reynolds number, which would imply laminar flow, which matches the problem statement. So that's correct.

Now, the Prandtl number for a power-law fluid is defined as Pr = (c_p * K (8 V_avg/D)^{n-1} ) / k.

Wait, I think the Prandtl number for non-Newtonian fluids is given by:

Pr = (c_p * μ_app ) / k.

But μ_app is the apparent viscosity, which for a power-law fluid is K (γ_dot)^{n-1}.

The shear rate γ_dot for a pipe is approximately 8 V_avg / D.

So, γ_dot = 8 * V_avg / D = 8 * 0.472 / (1/12) = 8 * 0.472 * 12 = 8 * 5.664 ≈45.31 s^-1.

Then, μ_app = K * (γ_dot)^{n-1} = K * (45.31)^{0.4 -1} = K * (45.31)^{-0.6}.

Compute (45.31)^{-0.6}:

Take natural log: ln(45.31) ≈3.814.

Multiply by -0.6: -2.288.

Exponentiate: e^-
