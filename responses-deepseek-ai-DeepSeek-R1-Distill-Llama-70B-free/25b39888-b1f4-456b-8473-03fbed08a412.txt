Okay, so I've got this property law question here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. It's about the different types of estates and future interests in property. I remember that when someone owns a property in fee simple, they have the highest form of ownership, which means they can do whatever they want with it, including transferring it.

The question says that the uncle executed a deed with a specific granting clause. The clause reads: "To my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew, then to my gardener." I need to figure out what this means for the ownership rights.

So, the first part is "To my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew." Wait, so both the nephew and niece are getting something for the life of the nephew. That sounds like a joint life estate, but I'm not entirely sure. Because it's "for the life of my nephew," that could mean that the estate lasts only as long as the nephew is alive. So both the nephew and niece have a life estate, but it's measured on the nephew's life. So if the nephew dies first, the estate ends, right?

Then, after that, it goes to the gardener. So the gardener is next in line. I think that's called a remainder. But is it a vested remainder or contingent? Well, the grant is to the gardener, so it's a transfer after the life estate ends. Since the life estate is for the nephew's life, the remainder would take effect upon his death. Now, the question is whether the remainder is vested or contingent. A vested remainder is when the right to the property is certain; there's no condition except the natural termination of the prior estate. In this case, the remainder is to the gardener, so as long as he's alive, it should be vested. Unless there's a condition like "if he's still working as my gardener," but there's no such condition here. So the gardener has a vested remainder.

Wait, but what about the niece? Because the initial grant is to both nephew and niece. So they both have a present interest in the property. So each of them holds a life estate, but it's for the life of the nephew. So their estates are tied to the nephew's lifespan. So when the nephew dies, both their life estates end, and the property goes to the gardener. 

So let me break it down. The nephew and niece each have a life estate, but it's measured by the nephew's life. So they're both life tenants, but the duration is based on the nephew's life. So if the niece dies before the nephew, does the nephew's estate continue? Yes, because the measuring life is the nephew, so the niece's death doesn't affect the duration. But wait, if the life estates are joint, then the death of one might affect the other. Hmm, not necessarily in this case because the duration is based on the nephew's life. So the niece's life estate ends when the nephew dies, regardless of whether she's alive or not.

Wait, but when the granting clause says "to A and B for the life of A," what does that mean? I think that both A and B have a life estate, but it's pur autre vie, meaning the duration is tied to someone else's life (here, the nephew's). So the niece's life estate would end when the nephew dies, even if she's still alive. So the life estate for both is tied to the nephew's life. So they both have a life estate pur autre vie, but that doesn't sound right because usually, a life estate is for someone's own life or someone else's (pur autre vie). So in this case, both nephew and niece have a life estate that lasts until the nephew dies. So the niece's life estate is pur autre vie because it's measured by someone else's life (the nephew's).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. When the grant is "to A and B for the life of A," does that mean each of them has a life estate measured by A's life? Or is it a joint life estate where they both have to die for it to end? I think it's the former. So each of them holds a life estate that ends upon A's death. So if A dies, both their estates end, and the remainder kicks in.

So in this case, the nephew (A) and niece (B) each have a life estate pur autre vie (since it's measured by the nephew's life). But wait, the nephew's own life estate is for his own life, right? So the nephew has a life estate for his own life, and the niece has a life estate measured by the nephew's life. Because the grant is "to nephew and niece for the life of nephew," that means the duration is tied to the nephew's life. So the nephew's estate ends at his death, and the niece's also ends at the nephew's death, even if she's still alive.

Wait, but that would mean the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, while the nephew has a regular life estate. So that's a bit different. So the nephew has a life estate for his own life, and the niece has a life estate for the nephew's life. So when the nephew dies, both estates end, and the property goes to the gardener, who has a vested remainder.

So looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this. Let's look at the options:

Option J: The nephew has a life estate, the niece also has a life estate, and the gardener has a vested remainder.

Wait, does this fit? Because in this case, both have life estates, but the niece's is pur autre vie. So the option says both have life estates, but doesn't specify that the niece's is based on the nephew's life. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the correct option is J, because it captures that both have life estates, and the gardener has a vested remainder.

Wait, but option J doesn't specify whether the niece's life estate is pur autre vie. So maybe that's not the right option. Let me check the other options.

Option H: The nephew has a life estate, the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder.

Wait, that seems to fit. Because the nephew's life estate is for his own life, and the niece's is for the nephew's life (so pur autre vie). Then the gardener has a vested remainder.

But wait, does the grant create two separate life estates, or a joint one? Because the grant is "to nephew and niece for the life of nephew." So it's possible that they are joint life tenants, but their estates are measured by the nephew's life. Alternatively, each has their own life estate, but the niece's is pur autre vie.

Wait, but in the granting clause, it's "to A and B for the life of A." So A (nephew) gets a life estate for his own life, and B (niece) gets a life estate that ends when A dies. So the niece's estate is pur autre vie.

So option H says nephew has a life estate, niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder. That seems correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option J says both have life estates, but not specifying pur autre vie. So perhaps the answer is H.

Wait, but another possibility: when the grant is "to A and B for the life of A," it could mean that both A and B have a life estate that lasts until A's death. So A's estate is for his own life, and B's is pur autre vie. So in that case, the answer would be H.

But I'm a bit confused because I remember that when you have a grant to two people for the life of one, each of them has a life estate measured by that one's life. So yes, the niece's estate would be pur autre vie.

So looking back at the options, option H says the nephew has a life estate, the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder. That seems correct.

Wait, but another option is J, which says both have life estates. But J doesn't specify that the niece's is pur autre vie. So perhaps J is correct because both have life estates, regardless of whose life they're based on.

Wait, but the key here is the type of estate each has. So the nephew has a life estate (his own), and the niece has a life estate pur autre vie (based on nephew's life). So the correct option would be H.

But let me look at the other options to make sure. Option D says that the nephew and niece are tenants in common, and the gardener has a vested remainder. But that's not right because their estates are for a life, not a fee.

Option J says both have life estates, which is correct, but doesn't specify that the niece's is pur autre vie. Hmm. Wait, but maybe the fact that the grant is for the life of the nephew affects both their estates. So both have life estates, but they are measured by the nephew's life. So in that case, both have life estates pur autre vie? Or is the nephew's measured by his own life, and the niece's by his.

Wait, the nephew's estate is his own life, and the niece's is tied to his. So the nephew has a regular life estate, and the niece has a life estate pur autre vie.

So the correct option would be H: nephew has a life estate, niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder.

Wait, but another point: when the grant is to two people for the life of one, then upon the death of that one, both their estates end. So the niece's estate ends when the nephew dies, even if she's still alive.

So the gardener's remainder is vested because it's not subject to any condition other than the termination of the prior estate. So the gardener has a vested remainder in fee simple.

So looking at the options:

Option J: The nephew has a life estate, the niece also has a life estate, and the gardener has a vested remainder.

That's correct in terms of the estates, but it doesn't specify that the niece's is pur autre vie. But perhaps the question doesn't require that level of detail, and just needs to know the types of estates.

Wait, but the answer needs to be the most accurate. So if the niece's estate is pur autre vie, then the option that specifies that is better.

Looking again, option H says:

H: The nephew has a life estate, the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder.

That's exactly what we have, so H should be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that when a grant is to A and B for the life of A, both A and B have a life estate that ends when A dies. So A's estate is for his own life, and B's is pur autre vie. So H seems correct.

But let me think again. When the grant is to A and B for the life of A, the estate given to A is a life estate for A's own life. The estate given to B is a life estate that lasts until A's death (pur autre vie). So yes, H is the correct answer.

Alternatively, if the grant was "to A and B for their lives," that would be a joint life estate with the last survivor. But in this case, it's for the life of the nephew, so it's different.

So the answer should be H.

The question revolves around the interpretation of a granting clause in a deed: "To my nephew and my niece for the life of my nephew, then to my gardener." The task is to determine the ownership rights created by this clause.

The granting clause creates a life estate for both the nephew and the niece, but the duration of their estates is tied to the nephew's life. Specifically:

1. **Nephew's Interest**: The nephew has a life estate for his own life. This is a standard life estate, where the estate ends upon his death.

2. **Niece's Interest**: The niece also has a life estate, but it is a life estate pur autre vie. This means her estate is measured by the nephew's life and ends when the nephew dies, regardless of whether she is still alive.

3. **Gardener's Interest**: After the life estates end (upon the nephew's death), the property passes to the gardener. The gardener has a vested remainder in fee simple because there is no condition attached to the remainder other than the natural termination of the prior estates.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option H**: Correctly states that the nephew has a life estate, the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder. This aligns with the analysis above.
- **Option J**: While it states that both the nephew and niece have life estates and the gardener has a vested remainder, it does not specify that the niece's life estate is pur autre vie. Since the question asks for the most accurate statement, Option H is preferable.

Thus, the most accurate answer is:

**H: The nephew has a life estate, the niece has a life estate pur autre vie, and the gardener has a vested remainder.**

Answer: H
