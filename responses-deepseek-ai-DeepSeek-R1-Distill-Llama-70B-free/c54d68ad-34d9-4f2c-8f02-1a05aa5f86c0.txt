Okay, so I need to find the voltage across an inductor when given the current through it. Hmm, I remember from my circuits class that inductors have a specific relationship between voltage and current. Oh right, Faraday's Law of Induction. The formula is something like v(t) equals L times the derivative of i(t) with respect to time. Yeah, that sounds right.

Wait, the inductance L is given as 10^-3 henry. And the current i_L(t) is 0.1 sin(10^6 t). So I need to take the derivative of this current. Oh right, the derivative of sin is cos. But also, when you take the derivative with respect to time, you multiply by the coefficient of t inside the sine function. So let me think about that.

Let me write down the formula again. v_L(t) = L * di_L/dt. So di_L/dt is the derivative of 0.1 sin(10^6 t) with respect to t. The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), and then times the derivative of x. Here, x is 10^6 t, so its derivative is 10^6. So putting that together, di_L/dt = 0.1 * 10^6 * cos(10^6 t).

Wait, let me calculate that. 0.1 times 10^6 is 10^5, right? Because 10^6 is a million, and 0.1 of that is 100,000, which is 1e5 or 10^5. So di_L/dt is 10^5 cos(10^6 t).

Then, multiplying by L, which is 1e-3 H. So v_L(t) is 1e-3 * 1e5 cos(10^6 t). Let me compute that. 1e-3 times 1e5 is (1e5)*(1e-3) = 1e2, which is 100. So the voltage is 100 cos(10^6 t).

Now, looking at the options, option G is 100 cos(1e6 t), which matches what I got. So the answer should be option G.

To find the voltage across the inductor, we use the relationship between voltage and current for an inductor:

\[
v_L(t) = L \cdot \frac{di_L}{dt}
\]

Here, the inductance \( L = 10^{-3} \, \text{H} \), and the current is given as \( i_L(t) = 0.1 \sin(10^6 t) \). To compute \( \frac{di_L}{dt} \), we take the derivative of \( i_L(t) \):

\[
\frac{di_L}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left[ 0.1 \sin(10^6 t) \right] = 0.1 \cdot 10^6 \cos(10^6 t)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{di_L}{dt} = 10^5 \cos(10^6 t)
\]

Now, substitute this into the formula for \( v_L(t) \):

\[
v_L(t) = L \cdot \frac{di_L}{dt} = 10^{-3} \cdot 10^5 \cos(10^6 t)
\]

\[
v_L(t) = 100 \cos(10^6 t)
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**G: \( 100 \cos(10^6 t) \)**

Answer: G
