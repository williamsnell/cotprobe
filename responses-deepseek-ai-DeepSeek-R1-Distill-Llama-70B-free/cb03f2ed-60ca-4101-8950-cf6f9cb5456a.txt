Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about kinetic energy. Hmm, I remember that kinetic energy has to do with the motion of an object. Let me think. The question says a pitcher throws a baseball that weighs 5 ounces, and it's moving at 96 feet per second. I need to find the kinetic energy in foot-pounds.

Wait, right, kinetic energy is calculated using the formula KE = (1/2)mv². Oh wait, but wait—units are important here. The mass is given in ounces, and the velocity is in feet per second. I need to make sure everything is in the right units because the answer options are in ft-lb.

So, first, I think I need to convert the weight into mass. Oh wait, weight is given as 5 ounces. But weight in the English system is in pounds-force, and mass is in slugs. Oh right, because weight (W) equals mass (m) times gravity (g). So m = W / g. But wait, weight is in ounces—oh, that's a unit of force? Or is it a unit of mass?

Wait, no. In the US system, ounces can be both volume and weight. Oh wait, no—ounces can be fluid ounces (volume) or avoirdupois ounces (mass). But in this context, it's a baseball's weight, so it's a force. Wait, no. Wait, when someone says the baseball weighs 5 ounces, they're talking about its mass. Or are they using "weigh" as force?

Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify. In the English system, weight is measured in pounds (force), and mass is measured in slugs. But sometimes people use "ounce" as a unit of mass, like when talking about food. So a 5-ounce baseball would mean its mass is 5 ounces. But wait, in physics terms, if we're using the formula, we need mass in slugs because the unit of force is pounds.

So wait, I think I need to convert 5 ounces (mass) into slugs. Because 1 slug is 32 pound-seconds squared per foot (lb·s²/ft). Alternatively, I can convert ounces to pounds because 1 pound is 16 ounces. So 5 ounces is 5/16 pounds (mass). Wait, no, that's not right because pounds are a unit of force, not mass. Oh wait, in the English system, mass is measured in slugs, and 1 slug is the mass that accelerates 1 foot per second squared when a pound of force is applied.

So to get the mass in slugs, since weight (force) is mass times gravity, I can write m = weight / g. But wait, the weight in pounds would be 5 ounces. Wait, no, because 5 ounces is a mass, not a force. So perhaps the question is mixing terms. Hmm, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: in common usage, when someone says a baseball weighs X ounces, they're referring to its mass. So 5 ounces (mass) is 5/16 pounds (mass), since 1 pound (mass) is 16 ounces (mass). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in the US system, 1 pound (force) is equal to the force of gravity on 1 pound mass. So I think I'm getting myself mixed up here.

Wait, another approach: the formula for kinetic energy in foot-pound units. The standard formula is KE = (1/2)mv², but when using m in slugs, v in feet per second, the KE would be in foot-pounds. But I'm not sure about the ounces part.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the mass from ounces to slugs. Let me look up the conversion. Oh wait, I can't actually look it up, but I remember that 1 slug is 32.174 pounds-mass. Or wait, 1 pound-mass is approximately 0.03125 slugs because 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft. So, if the baseball's mass is 5 ounces, I need to convert that to slugs.

Wait, 1 pound-mass is 16 ounces. So 5 ounces is 5/16 pounds-mass. Since 1 pound-mass equals approximately 0.03125 slugs (because 32.174 lb·s²/ft divided by 32.174 ft/s² gives 1 lb-force equals 1 slug per s², but I'm getting myself confused again).

Wait, let me approach it step by step. Let's first convert 5 ounces (mass) to pounds (mass). Since 16 ounces = 1 pound, 5 ounces = 5/16 pounds (mass). Now, since 1 slug is equal to 32.174 pounds (mass), so to get the mass in slugs, I divide by 32.174. So m = (5/16) / 32.174 slugs.

Wait, 5/16 is 0.3125. So 0.3125 divided by 32.174 is approximately 0.00969 slugs. Let me double-check: 32.174 times 0.03125 is 1, because 32.174 / 32.174 is 1. So 1 pound mass is 0.03125 slugs. So 5 ounces is 5*(1/16) lbm * (1 slug/32.174 lbm). Wait, no, sorry, wait: 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft. So 1 lbm (pound mass) is 1/32.174 slugs, because F = ma, so 1 slug is the mass that accelerates 1 ft/s² under 1 lb force. So m in slugs is weight in lb divided by g in ft/s².

Wait, the standard gravity is 32.174 ft/s². So m (slug) = weight (lb) / g (ft/s²). So if the baseball's weight is 5 ounces, wait, no, that's mass. Wait, perhaps the question is using weight in ounces, but in reality, if it's a 5-ounce baseball, that's the mass.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the weight in pounds. Since 1 lb-force is the force exerted by one pound mass under standard gravity. So if the baseball has a mass of 5 ounces, which is 5/16 lbm, then its weight in lb-force is m * g. So weight W = (5/16 lbm) * 32.174 ft/s². But that would give W in lb-force. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should just proceed with the formula and see. The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But I need m in slugs, v in ft/s. So I have v = 96 ft/s. So first, m in slugs.

So m = 5 ounces. Wait, 5 ounces is a mass, so I need to convert that to slugs. Let me think of the conversion factors.

1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft. Alternatively, 1 lbm = 0.03125 slugs. Because 1 slug is how much mass would accelerate 1 ft/s² with 1 lb of force. So since F=ma, a=F/m. So if F is 1 lb, and a is 1 ft/s², then m is 1 slug. So 1 slug = 32.174 lbm (since F=ma, so m = F/(a) = (1 lb)/(1 ft/s²). But wait, units: lb is a force, and m is in slugs. So perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of units. Since 1 slug = 32.174 lbm, then 1 lbm = 1/32.174 slugs ≈ 0.03108 slugs.

So 5 ounces is 5/16 lbm, which is 5/(16) * (1/32.174) slugs. Let me calculate that: 5 divided by (16 * 32.174) = 5/(516.784) ≈ 0.00968 slugs.

So m ≈ 0.00968 slugs. Now, velocity is 96 ft/s.

Then KE = 0.5 * m * v². Plugging in the numbers: 0.5 * 0.00968 * (96)^2.

Calculate 96 squared: 96 * 96 = 9216. 

Then 0.5 * 0.00968 * 9216.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 0.5 * 0.00968 = 0.00484.

Then 0.00484 * 9216.

Compute 9216 * 0.00484.

Let me compute 9216 * 0.004 = 36.864.

9216 * 0.00084 = Let me compute 9216 * 0.0008 = 7.3728, and 9216 * 0.00004 = 0.36864. So 7.3728 + 0.36864 = 7.74144.

So total is 36.864 + 7.74144 = 44.60544.

So KE ≈ 44.605 ft-lb.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:55, B:45, etc. Wait, option B is 45 ft-lb. So that's the closest.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, wait, 5 ounces is 5/16 lbm. 1 lbm is 0.03125 slugs, so 5/16 * 0.03125 = ?

Let me compute that: 5 divided by 16 is 0.3125. 0.3125 * 0.03125 = 0.009765625 slugs. So that's correct.

v² is 96^2 = 9216.

Then KE = 0.5 * 0.009765625 * 9216.

So 0.5 * 0.009765625 = 0.0048828125.

Multiply by 9216: 0.0048828125 *9216.

Let me compute 9216 * 0.0048828125.

Hmm, 9216 * 0.004 = 36.864.

9216 * 0.0008 = 7.3728.

9216 * 0.0000828125 = Let's compute 0.00008 *9216=0.73728, and 0.0000028125 *9216≈0.02592.

Wait, 0.0000828125 = 0.00008 + 0.0000028125.

So 0.73728 + 0.02592 = 0.7632.

So total would be 36.864 + 7.3728 = 44.2368, plus 0.7632 gives 45. So exactly 45 ft-lb.

Wait, so I think my earlier approximation was a bit off, but the exact calculation gives 45 ft-lb. So the correct answer would be option B:45 ft-lb.

Wait, but let me double-check all steps. Did I make a mistake in the mass conversion?

Wait, 5 ounces is 5/16 lbm. 1 lbm is 0.03125 slugs, so 5/16 * 0.03125 = (5 * 0.03125)/16.

Wait, 5 * 0.03125 is 0.15625. Then 0.15625 /16 = 0.009765625 slugs. Correct.

v is 96, so v squared is 9216.

Then KE = 0.5 * m * v² = 0.5 * 0.009765625 *9216.

0.5 * 0.009765625 is 0.0048828125.

Multiply by 9216: 0.0048828125 *9216.

Let me compute this using a different method.

0.0048828125 = 4.8828125e-3.

So 9216 * 4.8828125e-3 = ?

Compute 9216 * 4.8828125 = ?

Wait, 9216 * 4 = 36864.

9216 * 0.8828125 = Let's compute 9216 *0.8=7372.8, 9216 *0.08=737.28, 9216 *0.0028125 ≈26.0 (exactly: 9216 *0.0028125=26.0).

Wait, 0.8 + 0.08 = 0.88, plus 0.0028125 is 0.8828125.

So 7372.8 + 737.28 = 8,110.08, plus 26.0 gives 8,136.08.

So total 9216 *4.8828125=36864 +8,136.08=42, 000.08?? Wait, 36864 +8,136.08 = 42, 000.08? Let me compute: 36864 + 8136.08 = 45000.08.

Wait, 36864 + 8136 = 45000. So 9216 * 4.8828125 = 45,000.08 approximately.

But then, 0.0048828125 *9216 = (4.8828125e-3) *9216 = 45,000.08e-3 = 45.00024 ft-lb. So that's exactly 45 ft-lb. So the correct answer is B:45 ft-lb.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the mass conversion. Because sometimes people get confused between mass and force. So in the question, the baseball's weight is 5 ounces, but in physics terms, weight is a force. So perhaps the question is correct, and I should treat 5 ounces as the force, which would require a different approach.

Wait, that's a good point. If the question says the baseball weighs 5 ounces, that would imply the weight (force) is 5 ounces-force. But that's unusual because typically weight is expressed in pounds, and 5 ounces is less than a pound. So perhaps the question is using "weigh" in the sense of mass. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and they meant the mass is 5 ounces.

Wait, but if weight is 5 ounces-force, then to find the mass, I would use m = W/g. But wait, W would be in lb-force. So 5 ounces is 5/16 lb-force. Then m = (5/16 lb) / (32 ft/s²) ) = (5/16) /32 slugs.

Wait, because m = W/g, and W is in lb, g is 32 ft/s². So m = (5/16)/32 = 5/(16*32) =5/512 slugs. Then, calculating KE with m=5/512 slugs and v=96 ft/s.

So KE = 0.5 * (5/512) * (96)^2.

Compute 96^2 = 9216.

Then, 0.5 * 5/512 *9216.

Compute 9216 *5 =46080; 46080 /512 = 46080 ÷512.

Well, 512 *90=46080, so 46080/512 =90.

Then, 0.5 *90 =45. So same result. So whether 5 ounces is mass or force, the KE comes out to be 45 ft-lb.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if 5 ounces is mass, then m=5/16 lbm = 5/(16 * 32.174) slugs. Wait, but in the previous calculation where I treated 5 ounces as mass, I got the same answer as when I treated it as force. That can't be a coincidence.

Wait a second, perhaps the units are set up in such a way that it works out. Because when using W in lb-force, m = W/g, and when using W as mass (lbm), then m is W (lbm) / (1 lbm / slug * g), which would be the same as m = W (lbm) * (1 slug / (g lbm)).

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting too tangled here. But in both approaches, the kinetic energy comes out to 45 ft-lb. So the answer must be B:45 ft-lb.
</think>

To calculate the kinetic energy of the baseball, we use the formula for kinetic energy:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]

where \(m\) is the mass in slugs and \(v\) is the velocity in feet per second. The problem states that the baseball weighs 5 ounces and travels at 96 feet per second. Since the options are in foot-pounds (ft-lb), we need to ensure all units are consistent.

### Step 1: Convert mass to slugs
The baseball's weight is given as 5 ounces. In the English system, weight can refer to force, but here it is interpreted as mass. To convert 5 ounces (mass) to slugs:

1. Convert ounces to pounds (mass):  
   \[
   5 \, \text{ounces} = \frac{5}{16} \, \text{lbm}
   \]

2. Convert pounds (mass) to slugs:  
   \[
   1 \, \text{lbm} = 0.03125 \, \text{slugs}, \quad \text{so} \quad m = \frac{5}{16} \times 0.03125 = 0.009765625 \, \text{slugs}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate velocity squared
The velocity of the baseball is 96 feet per second. Squaring this value:

\[
v^2 = 96^2 = 9216 \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

### Step 3: Compute kinetic energy
Substitute the values of \(m\) and \(v^2\) into the kinetic energy formula:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.009765625 \times 9216
\]

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{2} \times 0.009765625\):

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 0.009765625 = 0.0048828125
\]

Then multiply by \(921
