Okay, so I've got this problem here about Leo's Restaurant buying a neon sign. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my accounting terms, but I'll take it slow.

First, the purchase was made on July 1st for $202. The discount terms are given as (3/10), (n/30) R.O.G. Hmm, I remember that R.O.G. stands for "Remittance On Goods," which I think means that the discount period starts when the goods are received, not when the invoice is dated. So the 10 days for the discount would start counting from when the sign was delivered, not from July 1.

The sign was delivered on July 12. So the discount period begins on that day. The payment was made on July 20. I need to figure out if this payment date is within the discount period to get the 3% discount.

Wait, let me make sure. The terms are 3/10, n/30. That means a 3% discount if paid within 10 days, otherwise, the net is due in 30 days. But since it's R.O.G., the 10-day period starts from July 12. So the last day to get the discount would be July 12 plus 10 days, which is July 22. Oh wait, but payment was made on July 20, which is before July 22. So they qualify for the discount.

So the calculation would be the invoice amount minus 3% of that. Let me compute that: 3% of $202 is 0.03 * 202. Let me calculate that. 0.03 times 200 is 6, and 0.03 times 2 is 0.06, so total is 6.06. So the discount is $6.06. Subtracting that from $202 gives $195.94. So the amount paid should be $195.94.

Looking at the options, option B is $195.94. So I think that's the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check the dates. From July 12 to July 20 is 8 days, right? Because 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20—that's 9 days including both start and end? Wait, no, when you count days from the 12th to the 20th, it's 8 days because you exclude the starting day. So 20 minus 12 is 8 days. So yes, that's within the 10-day window. So the discount applies.

Another thing to consider: are there any other charges or terms? The problem doesn't mention any, so I think it's straightforward—just the 3% discount.

The problem involves calculating the amount paid by Leo's Restaurant for a neon sign purchased under specific discount terms. The invoice amount is $202, with terms (3/10), (n/30) R.O.G. The key points are:

1. **R.O.G. (Remittance On Goods):** The discount period starts when the goods are delivered, not when the invoice is dated. The sign was delivered on July 12, so the 10-day discount period begins on this date.

2. **Payment Date:** The payment was made on July 20. Since July 20 falls within the 10-day discount period (July 12 to July 22), the restaurant qualifies for the 3% discount.

3. **Discount Calculation:** The discount is 3% of $202:
   \[
   0.03 \times 202 = 6.06
   \]
   Subtracting the discount from the invoice amount:
   \[
   202 - 6.06 = 195.94
   \]

Thus, the amount paid is $195.94, which corresponds to option **B**.

**Answer: B**
