E: Title is in the sister and the cousin as tenants in common, with the sister having a 40% interest and the cousin having a 60% interest.
F: Title is in the sister and the cousin as equal tenants in common.
G: Title is in the sister and the cousin as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

Okay, so I've got this question about joint tenancy and what happens when one of the joint tenants dies. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

Alright, the setup is that a brother and sister bought land as joint tenants with right of survivorship. I remember that joint tenancy means they both own the property together, and if one dies, the other automatically gets the deceased's share. So, the key here is the right of survivorship, which overrides any will, right? Because even if the brother's will leaves everything to his cousin, the joint tenancy might take precedence.

The purchase price was $50,000. The sister paid $10k, and the brother paid $40k. Wait, does that matter for the ownership? I think when you buy as joint tenants, each owns an equal share, regardless of how much each contributed. So each would own 50%, even though the brother paid more. But maybe that's only for the title. The contributions might affect the equity or the mortgage situation.

Then the sister mortgaged her interest. Oh, so she took out a mortgage on her share. Later, the brother dies, leaving his estate to his cousin. But since they were joint tenants, the brother's share should go to the sister, right? Because of the right of survivorship, the sister would own the entire property after the brother's death.

Wait, but the sister had a mortgage. So what happens with that? She later paid off the mortgage and got it released. Does that affect the ownership? Well, the mortgage was on her interest. So when she paid it off, she owned her share free and clear. But since the brother died, she should own the whole thing now.

Wait, but let's think again. The mortgage was on her own interest. So when she took out the mortgage, she was pledging her 50% interest. But if she dies first, the brother would get her share. But in this case, the brother died first. So the sister's mortgage wouldn't affect the brother's share, because his share would have gone to her upon his death.

So after the brother dies, the sister owns 100% of the property because of the joint tenancy. The fact that she had a mortgage on her half shouldn't matter anymore because upon the brother's death, she took his half, making her the sole owner. She paid off the mortgage, so the cousin shouldn't have any claim.

Looking at the options:

A: Cousin owns everything. No, because joint tenancy overrides the will.

B: Depends on lien vs title theory. I don't think so because the mortgage is paid off.

C: Brother's share in probate. No, joint tenancy avoids probate.

D: Sister, cousin, and lender as tenants in common. Mortgage is paid, so lender is out.

E: Sister and cousin with 40% and 60%. No, because sister should own all.

F: Sister and cousin as equal tenants in common. No, because sister should have everything.

G: Sister and cousin as joint tenants. No, because the brother's interest went to sister.

H: Sister owns everything. Yes, that seems right.

Wait, but let me make sure. The sister mortgaged her interest, but the brother's death means she gets his half. So the mortgage was only on her original half, which she paid off. So after paying off, she owns both halves.

So the answer should be H.

The brother and sister purchased the land as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. This means that upon the death of one tenant, the surviving tenant automatically inherits the entire property, regardless of any will. The purchase price of $50,000, with the sister contributing $10,000 and the brother contributing $40,000, does not affect the equal ownership of the property under joint tenancy.

The sister mortgaged her interest in the land, but this only affected her 50% share. When the brother died, the sister became the sole owner of the property due to the right of survivorship. The fact that the sister later paid off the mortgage and had it released further solidifies her full ownership of the property. The brother’s will, which left his estate to his cousin, is irrelevant because joint tenancy overrides the will.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The cousin cannot inherit the property because the right of survivorship ensures the sister becomes the sole owner.
- **B**: Incorrect. The distinction between lien theory and title theory of mortgages is irrelevant here since the mortgage was paid off.
- **C**: Incorrect. The brother’s share does not go into probate because joint tenancy avoids probate.
- **D**: Incorrect. The mortgage lender is no longer involved since the debt was paid off.
- **E**: Incorrect. The sister and cousin do not own the property as tenants in common because the sister owns the entire property.
- **F**: Incorrect. The sister and cousin are not tenants in common; the sister owns the property outright.
- **G**: Incorrect. The sister and cousin are not joint tenants because the brother’s interest passed entirely to the sister.
- **H**: Correct. The sister owns the property entirely after paying off the mortgage.

Thus, the sister is the sole owner of the land. 

Answer: H
