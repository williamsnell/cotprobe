Okay, so I've got this question about quasi species viruses, like influenza and HIV. Hmm, I remember that quasi species refers to a group of viruses that have a lot of genetic variation. But wait, let me think through this properly.

The question is asking which characteristic is true of quasi species viruses. The options are A through J. Let me go through each option one by one to see which fits.

Option A: Possesses only RNA. Well, I know that both influenza and HIV do have RNA. Influenza is an RNA virus, and HIV is a retrovirus, which also has RNA. But wait, is that the defining characteristic of quasi species? I'm not sure. Quasi species is more about the genetic variation, not necessarily the type of genetic material they have. So maybe this isn't the right answer.

Option B: A stable and unchanging genome. No, that doesn't sound right. If they're quasi species, they must have a lot of mutations and changes, so the genome is anything but stable. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C: Possesses only DNA. No, I don't think so. As mentioned earlier, both examples are RNA viruses. So C is out.

Option D: Has a single, unsegmented genome. Wait, influenza has a segmented genome. It has several segments of RNA. So D is incorrect because influenza has segmented genomes. Maybe HIV has a single genome, but I'm not sure. Either way, the presence of segmentation in one of the examples makes D not the right choice.

Option E: Possesses RNA and DNA. That's not right because both influenza and HIV don't have both. Influenza is RNA only, and HIV is RNA that converts to DNA during replication, but the virus itself doesn't possess both. So E is incorrect.

Option F: A very large genome. I think larger genomes are usually found in DNA viruses like herpes or something. Influenza and HIV have relatively smaller genomes, so F is probably not the answer.

Option G: A fragmented or segmented genome. Oh, right! Influenza has a segmented RNA genome, which allows for antigenic shift through reassortment. So G is a characteristic. But wait, what about HIV? I think HIV has a single RNA genome, not fragmented. So does that mean G is not the correct answer for both examples? Hmm, maybe I'm conflating things. Or perhaps the question is considering that quasi species have a range of variants, which could come from various factors like high mutation rates, recombination, or in the case of influenza, segmentation leading to more diversity. So maybe G is a correct point, but I'm not entirely certain yet.

Option H: Co-existence of innumerable genetic variants. Yes, this rings a bell. Quasi species are defined by a high degree of genetic variation. They exist as a group of closely related but distinct genetic variants. So H sounds correct. Both influenza and HIV have this. HIV mutates rapidly, leading to many variants, and influenza's segmented genome allows for reassortment, creating many strains.

Option I: Cannot mutate or evolve. That's the opposite of what quasi species do. They mutate and evolve quickly, so I is incorrect.

Option J: Only exists in one form or variant. Again, the opposite. They have many variants, so J is wrong.

So now I'm trying to decide between G and H. The question is, which is a characteristic of quasi species viruses. Quasi species theory emphasizes the presence of many variants due to mutation and selection. So H would be the correct answer. While G is true for influenza, it's not a general characteristic of all quasi species viruses, like HIV. So the best answer is H.

Quasi species viruses, such as influenza and HIV, are characterized by their high degree of genetic diversity. This diversity arises due to factors like rapid mutation rates, recombination, and, in the case of influenza, reassortment of segmented genomes. Among the options provided:

- **A, C, E, F, I, J**: These are incorrect because they do not align with the defining features of quasi species viruses. For example, quasi species viruses are not limited to RNA (A) or DNA (C), do not have very large genomes (F), and are not restricted to a single form or variant (J). They also mutate and evolve rapidly, so I is incorrect.

- **B, D**: These are also incorrect. Quasi species viruses do not have stable, unchanging genomes (B), and while influenza has a segmented genome (D), this is not a universal characteristic of all quasi species viruses, such as HIV.

- **G**: While influenza has a fragmented or segmented genome, this is not a defining feature of quasi species viruses in general, as HIV does not have a segmented genome.

- **H**: This is correct. Quasi species viruses are defined by the co-existence of numerous genetic variants due to their high mutation rates and rapid evolution. This characteristic applies to both influenza and HIV.

Thus, the best answer is **H**.

Answer: H
