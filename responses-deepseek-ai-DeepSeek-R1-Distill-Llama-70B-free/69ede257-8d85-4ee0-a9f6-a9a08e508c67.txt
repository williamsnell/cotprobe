Okay, so I've got this problem about the salaries of technical writers. Let me see. The question says that the annual salaries are approximately normally distributed with a mean of $55,800. The first quartile is $48,815, and I need to find the standard deviation from the options given.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but I remember that in a normal distribution, the quartiles relate to the percentiles. The first quartile is the 25th percentile, right? So that means 25% of the data is below that point, and 75% is above.

Wait, in a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all the same. So the median here is $55,800. The first quartile is at 25%, so it's below the mean. The third quartile would be at 75%, above the mean.

I think the interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between Q3 and Q1. But wait, in this question, I only have Q1 given. So perhaps I can relate this to the standard deviation using the properties of the normal distribution.

Oh right, in a normal distribution, the percentiles can be related to z-scores. The z-score for the first quartile (25th percentile) is -0.6745, if I remember correctly. Because the 25th percentile is one standard deviation below the mean in a certain way.

Wait, let me think. The z-score formula is z = (X - μ) / σ. Here, X is the value (Q1), μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation we're looking for.

So plugging in the values, Q1 is $48,815. So:

-0.6745 = (48815 - 55800) / σ

Let me calculate the numerator. 48815 minus 55800 is... let's see, 55,800 minus 48,815. 55,800 minus 48,000 is 7,800, and then 48,815 is 815 more than 48,000. So 7,800 minus 815 is 6,985. So the difference is negative 6,985.

So the equation becomes:

-0.6745 = (-6985) / σ

I want to solve for σ. Let's rearrange that. Multiply both sides by σ:

-0.6745 * σ = -6985

Then, divide both sides by -0.6745:

σ = (-6985) / (-0.6745) = 6985 / 0.6745

Let me compute that. Let's approximate. 6985 divided by 0.6745.

Wait, 6985 ÷ 0.6745 ≈ Let's see, 6985 ÷ 0.6 is about 11,642.5. But since 0.6745 is a bit more than 0.6, the result will be a bit less than that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 6985 ÷ 0.6745.

Wait, 0.6745 times 10,000 is 6,745. So 0.6745 * 10,356 is about... let's see, 0.6745*10,000=6,745. 0.6745 * 356 = ?

Wait, maybe I should just do the division properly. Let me compute 6985 ÷ 0.6745.

Let me see, 0.6745 * 10,000 = 6,745. So 6,745 is less than 6,985 by 240. So how much more do I need beyond 10,000?

So 0.6745 * x = 6,985.

We know 0.6745 * 10,000 = 6,745.

6,985 - 6,745 = 240.

So, 240 = 0.6745 * y, where y is the additional amount beyond 10,000.

So y = 240 / 0.6745 ≈ Let's calculate that. 240 ÷ 0.6745.

Hmm, 0.6745 * 356 = ?

Wait, 0.6745 * 300 = 202.35. 0.6745 * 56 = let's see, 0.6745*50=33.725, and 0.6745*6=4.047. So 33.725 +4.047=37.772. So 0.6745 *356=202.35 +37.772=240.122. Wow, that's very close to 240.

So y≈356.

So total is 10,000 + 356 = 10,356. So σ≈10,356.

Looking at the options, option D is $10,356. So the answer should be D.

To determine the standard deviation of the salaries, we use the relationship between the first quartile (Q1), the mean (μ), and the z-score for the 25th percentile in a normal distribution. The z-score for Q1 is approximately **-0.6745**. The formula for the z-score is:

\[
z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

Here:
- \( X = 48,815 \) (Q1),
- \( \mu = 55,800 \) (mean),
- \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation.

Substituting the values:

\[
-0.6745 = \frac{48,815 - 55,800}{\sigma}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
48,815 - 55,800 = -6,985
\]

The equation becomes:

\[
-0.6745 = \frac{-6,985}{\sigma}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( \sigma \):

\[
\sigma = \frac{-6,985}{-0.6745} = \frac{6,985}{0.6745}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\sigma \approx 10,356
\]

From the given options, the closest value to the calculated standard deviation is **$10,356**, which corresponds to option **D**.
