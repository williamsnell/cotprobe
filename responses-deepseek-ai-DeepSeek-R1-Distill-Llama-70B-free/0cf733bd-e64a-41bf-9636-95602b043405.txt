Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the nth roots of unity and whether they form a group or something else. Hmm, I remember that the nth roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy the equation x^n = 1. Right, they are evenly spaced around the unit circle in the complex plane.

Wait, the question is about the set of all nth roots of unity under multiplication. So I need to think about group theory here. The options include various types of groups and semigroups.

Let me recall the group axioms. A group must have an associative binary operation, an identity element, every element must have an inverse, and the set must be closed under the operation.

So the nth roots of unity include 1, and when you multiply any two of them, you get another nth root of unity. Because (e^(2πik/n)) * (e^(2πil/n)) = e^(2πi(k+l)/n), and since addition modulo n wraps around, this is another root. So closure holds.

Is the operation associative? Multiplication of complex numbers is associative, so yes. 

Identity element is definitely 1, since multiplying by 1 doesn't change anything.

Each nth root of unity has an inverse in the set. Because for each e^(2πik/n), its inverse is e^(-2πik/n) = e^(2πi(n-k)/n), which is also an nth root of unity. So inverses are present.

Now, what about commutativity? When we multiply two roots, does the order matter? Let's see: e^(2πik/n) * e^(2πil/n) = e^(2πi(k+l)/n) and e^(2πil/n) * e^(2πik/n) is the same. So multiplication is commutative. Hence, the group is abelian.

Wait, so the set under multiplication is an abelian group. Let's look at the options. Option E is abelian group. Option C is commutative semigroup with identity, but a group is more than that because it includes inverses. So E seems correct.

Another thought: how many elements are there? There are exactly n distinct nth roots of unity, so it's a finite group. But the options don't specify finite or infinite, except option B is infinite. So no, in this case, the group is finite, but the question is about the type, not the size.

So putting it all together, the nth roots of unity form a group under multiplication, and since multiplication is commutative here, it's an abelian group. So the answer must be E.

The set of all nth roots of unity consists of complex numbers that satisfy the equation \(x^n = 1\). These roots are evenly spaced around the unit circle in the complex plane. Under multiplication, this set must be analyzed in terms of group theory.

To determine the structure, we check the group axioms:

1. **Closure**: The product of any two nth roots of unity is another nth root of unity because \((e^{2\pi i k/n}) \cdot (e^{2\pi i l/n}) = e^{2\pi i (k+l)/n}\), and addition modulo \(n\) ensures the result remains within the set.
2. **Associativity**: Multiplication of complex numbers is associative.
3. **Identity Element**: The element \(1\) serves as the identity since multiplying any root by \(1\) leaves it unchanged.
4. **Inverses**: Every nth root of unity has an inverse within the set, as the inverse of \(e^{2\pi i k/n}\) is \(e^{-2\pi i k/n} = e^{2\pi i (n-k)/n}\), which is also an nth root of unity.

Additionally, the multiplication operation is commutative because \(e^{2\pi i k/n} \cdot e^{2\pi i l/n} = e^{2\pi i (k+l)/n} = e^{2\pi i (l+k)/n} = e^{2\pi i l/n} \cdot e^{2\pi i k/n}\). This makes the group abelian.

Analyzing the options:
- **A, D, F**: Incorrect because the group is abelian, not non-commutative.
- **B**: Incorrect because the group is finite, with exactly \(n\) elements.
- **C, G**: Incorrect because the set is more than just a semigroup; it satisfies all group axioms.
- **E**: Correct because the set forms an abelian group under multiplication.

Thus, the set of all nth roots of unity under multiplication forms an abelian group.

Answer: E
