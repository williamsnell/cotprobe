Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these types of questions, but I'll give it a shot. Let me read through it again.

The problem says: A ball with a volume of 500 cm³ is hung from a wire. The wire has a cross-sectional area of 2e-3 cm². Young's modulus for the wire is 7e11 dynes/cm². When the ball is immersed in water, the length of the wire decreases by 0.05 cm. We need to find the original length of the wire.

Wait, okay. So the setup is that the ball is hanging from the wire, stretching it. Then when it's submerged in water, the buoyant force reduces the effective weight, so the wire's length decreases. So the decrease is due to the change in stress (force) in the wire.

Hmm. I remember that Young's modulus relates stress and strain. The formula is Y = (F/A)/(ΔL/L), where Y is Young's modulus, F is the force applied, A is the cross-sectional area, ΔL is the change in length, and L is the original length.

Wait, but wait: when the ball is in water, the buoyant force reduces the effective force on the wire. So the force when submerged is less than when in air. The difference in force must cause the change in length.

So first, I should calculate the change in force when the ball is submerged. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced water. The volume of the ball is 500 cm³, so the mass of the displaced water is 500 cm³ * density of water.

Wait, density of water is 1 g/cm³, right? So the displaced water's mass is 500 g. So the weight (buoyant force) is mass * g. But wait, what's g in CGS units? Oh right, g is 980 cm/s².

So the buoyant force F_buoyant is 500 g * 980 cm/s². Let me calculate that. 500 * 980 = 490,000 dynes. Because 1 gram is 1 dyne/cm²? Wait, no, weight in dynes is mass (g) * g (cm/s²), so yeah, 500 * 980 = 490,000 dynes.

So the force when the ball is in air is greater than when it's in water by this buoyant force. Let me think: the initial force (in air) is the weight of the ball plus the buoyant force maybe? No, wait. When the ball is in air, the force on the wire is just the weight of the ball. When it's submerged, the weight is reduced by the buoyant force. So the change in force is F_buoyant.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The force causing the extension in the wire is the weight of the ball. So when the ball is in air, the force is F_air = m * g, which is the weight. When submerged, F_water = F_air - F_buoyant. So the change in force is F_air - F_water = F_buoyant. So the force decreases by F_buoyant when submerged. Therefore, the extension decreases, which is what the problem says—the length decreases by 0.05 cm.

So the change in force is F_buoyant = 490,000 dynes. Wait, no, because F_air is mg, and F_water is mg - F_buoyant. So the difference is F_air - F_water = F_buoyant. So the force applied to the wire decreases by F_buoyant, which is 490,000 dynes.

Wait, Young's modulus relates to the stress and strain. So the formula is Y = (F/A)/(ΔL/L). But here, the change in force (ΔF) is F_buoyant. So F is the initial force, which is the weight of the ball. But wait, when the ball is in water, the force is F - F_buoyant. So the change in force is F_buoyant, which is the difference between the two. So the wire experiences a decrease in force of F_buoyant, which causes a decrease in length.

So the formula for the change in length would be ΔL = (F_buoyant * L) / (A * Y).

Wait, wait, let me think again. The formula from Young's modulus is ΔL = (F * L) / (A Y). So when the force decreases by F_buoyant, the change in length would be (F_buoyant * L) / (A Y). Because ΔF is F_buoyant.

Yes, that makes sense. So ΔL is given as 0.05 cm, and we can solve for L.

So let's plug in the numbers.

ΔL = (F_buoyant * L) / (A Y)

We need to solve for L:

L = (ΔL * A Y) / F_buoyant

Wait, wait, no. Let's rearrange the formula.

ΔL = (F * L) / (A Y)

But in this case, the change in length is due to a change in force, so ΔF = F_initial - F_final = F_buoyant.

So for the change in length ΔL, it's equal to (ΔF * L) / (A Y).

Wait, but wait, the original force is F_initial = weight of ball. But when submerged, F_final = F_initial - F_buoyant. So the change in force is F_buoyant.

So the change in length ΔL = (F_buoyant * L) / (A Y). So solving for L:

L = (ΔL * A Y) / F_buoyant

Wait, no, because:

ΔL = (ΔF * L) / (A Y)

So, L = (ΔL * A Y) / ΔF

Yes, that makes sense.

So let me plug in the numbers.

ΔL is 0.05 cm.

A is 2e-3 cm².

Y is 7e11 dynes/cm².

ΔF is F_buoyant = 490,000 dynes.

So,

L = (0.05 cm * 2e-3 cm² * 7e11 dynes/cm²) / (490,000 dynes)

Let me compute the numerator first.

0.05 * 2e-3 = 0.05 * 0.002 = 0.0001 cm³.

Wait, wait: 0.05 cm * 2e-3 cm² = (0.05) * (2e-3) cm³. Wait, but Y is in dynes/cm², so when multiplied by area (cm²), it becomes dynes. Let me think units:

Wait, let me compute the numerator:

0.05 cm * 2e-3 cm² * 7e11 dynes/cm².

So 0.05 cm * 2e-3 cm² = 1e-4 cm³.

Then multiply by 7e11: 1e-4 * 7e11 = 7e7. The units would be cm³ * (dynes/cm²) ?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of units.

Wait, Young's modulus Y has units of dynes/cm².

F is in dynes.

A is cm². So (F/A) is (dynes/cm²), which is Y.

ΔL over L is dimensionless.

So the formula is correct.

But perhaps I should compute each part step by step.

Calculating numerator:

0.05 cm * 2e-3 cm² = (0.05) * (2e-3) = 0.0001 cm³. Then multiply by 7e11:

0.0001 cm³ * 7e11 = 7e7 cm³·dynes/cm².

Wait, but denominator is F_buoyant in dynes.

So the denominator is 490,000 dynes.

So the entire expression is:

(7e7 cm³·dynes/cm²) / (490,000 dynes) )

Wait, but the cm³ and cm² would give cm. So the units would be cm.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it too much. Let me compute the numbers without worrying about units for a moment.

Numerator: 0.05 * 2e-3 * 7e11.

Let me calculate that:

0.05 is 5e-2.

So 5e-2 * 2e-3 = (5 * 2) * 1e-5 = 10e-5 = 1e-4.

Then multiply by 7e11: 1e-4 * 7e11 = 7e7.

So numerator is 7e7.

Denominator is 490,000 = 4.9e5.

So L = (7e7) / (4.9e5) cm.

Calculate that:

7e7 / 4.9e5 = (7 / 4.9) * 1e2.

7 divided by 4.9 is approximately 1.42857.

So 1.42857 * 1e2 = 142.857 cm.

Looking at the options, option B is 142.9 cm, which matches. So the answer should be B.

To solve the problem, we use Young's modulus formula:

\[
Y = \frac{\frac{F}{A}}{\frac{\Delta L}{L}}
\]

Rearranging for \( L \), the length of the wire:

\[
L = \frac{\Delta L \cdot A \cdot Y}{\Delta F}
\]

### Given Data:
- Change in length: \( \Delta L = 0.05 \, \text{cm} \)
- Cross-sectional area: \( A = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{cm}^2 \)
- Young's modulus: \( Y = 7 \times 10^{11} \, \text{dynes/cm}^2 \)
- Buoyant force: \( \Delta F = F_{\text{buoyant}} = 490,000 \, \text{dynes} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the numerator
\[
\Delta L \cdot A \cdot Y = (0.05) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-3}) \cdot (7 \times 10^{11})
\]
\[
= (5 \times 10^{-2}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-3}) \cdot (7 \times 10^{11})
\]
\[
= (10 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot (7 \times 10^{11})
\]
\[
= 7 \times 10^{7}
\]

### Step 2: Divide by the denominator
\[
L = \frac{7 \times 10^{7}}{490,000}
\]
\[
= \frac{7 \times 10^{7}}{4.9 \times 10^{5}}
\]
\[
= \frac{7}{4.9} \cdot 10^{2}
\]
\[
\approx 1.42857 \cdot 10^{2}
\]
\[
\approx 142.857 \, \text{cm}
\]

### Final Answer:
The length of the wire is approximately **142.9 cm**, which corresponds to option **B**.
