Question:

Distinguish between the two types of proteins produced by ribosomes.

Options:

A: Structural proteins provide temporary cellular functions, while functional proteins provide permanent structure to cells

C: Structural proteins catalyze chemical reactions while functional proteins are involved in the structure of the cell
D: Structural proteins are soluble in the cell while functional proteins are generally insoluble
E: Structural proteins are found only outside the cell, while functional proteins are exclusively found inside the cell
F: Structural proteins are only used for muscle contraction, while functional proteins are responsible for energy production
G: Structural proteins are part of the cell protoplasm and contribute to cell and body growth, while functional proteins control cell activity such as hormone production or nutrient metabolism.
H: Structural proteins are unable to catalyze any reactions, while functional proteins form the structural components of ribosomes
I: Structural proteins are synthesized from amino acids in the cytoplasm, while functional proteins are synthesized in the nucleus
J: Structural proteins are produced by free ribosomes, while functional proteins are produced by membrane-bound ribosomes

Okay, so I have this question about proteins produced by ribosomes and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking to distinguish between two types of proteins made by ribosomes. I remember that proteins can be classified into structural and functional categories. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact differences.

Structural proteins, as the name suggests, are probably involved in the structure of cells and tissues. Like, they provide support or form parts of the cell's framework. Examples that come to mind are collagen in connective tissue or keratin in skin and hair. These proteins are usually fibrous and give structure.

Functional proteins, on the other hand, are more about doing specific jobs. They are usually globular and catalyze reactions, transport molecules, or act as hormones. Enzymes are a big part of this category because they speed up biochemical reactions. Also, proteins like hemoglobin which carries oxygen or antibodies that fight infections are functional.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Structural provide temp functions, functional give permanent structure. That doesn't sound right. I thought structural are more about structure, not temporary functions.

Option B: Structural control activity, functional part of protoplasm. Hmm, I'm not sure. Control activity doesn't quite fit with structural proteins. Maybe not the best choice.

Option C: Structural catalyze reactions, functional for structure. Wait, that's the opposite. Structural shouldn't catalyze; that's enzymes (functional). So C is probably wrong.

Option D: Structural soluble, functional insoluble. I'm not sure if that's accurate. Like, some structural proteins are soluble (e.g., blood proteins), others aren't (like collagen). Maybe this isn't a solid distinction.

Option E: Structural only outside, functional inside. No, that's not correct. Both types are found inside and outside. For example, muscles have structural proteins inside the cell, and some functional enzymes are inside cells.

Option F: Structural only for muscles, functional for energy. That's too narrow. Structural proteins are in many places, not just muscles. And functional do a lot more than just energy.

Option G: Structural part of protoplasm, contribute to growth; functional control activity like hormones. Wait, structural proteins being part of protoplasm (the cell substance) makes sense. And functional proteins do control activities, like enzymes or hormones. This seems plausible.

Option H: Structural can't catalyze, functional form ribosomes. Hmm, functional proteins as part of ribosomes? Ribosomes are made of rRNA and proteins, so maybe some structural proteins are part of them. Not sure if this is the best option.

Option I: Structural from amino acids in cytoplasm, functional in nucleus. No, both are made by ribosomes, which are in the cytoplasm or attached to ER. Not about location of synthesis like nucleus.

Option J: Structural by free ribosomes, functional by bound. Wait, free ribosomes make proteins that stay in the cell, like structural proteins. Bound ribosomes make proteins for secretion or membranes, which are often functional like enzymes or hormones. So maybe this is correct. For example, structural proteins like actin are made by free ribosomes, while many enzymes (functional) are made by attached ribosomes.

Wait, but I thought structural proteins might include things like those in the cell matrix, which could be made by bound ribosomes if they are secreted. Hmm. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Structural proteins like those in the cytoskeleton are made by free ribosomes because they stay inside the cell. Functional proteins, such as those secreted (like digestive enzymes) or membrane proteins, are made by ribosomes attached to the ER. So option J says structural are from free, functional from membrane-bound. That seems correct.

So looking back, the options G and J are both possible.

Option G says structural proteins are part of protoplasm and contribute to growth, while functional control activity. That aligns with my initial thoughts. But option J is about the location of ribosomes.

Wait, the question is about the types of proteins, not where they're made. So the correct distinction is about their function and structure, not the ribosomes they come from. Because the question is about the types, not the production location.

So I think G is the correct answer. Let me check option G again.

Option G: Structural proteins are part of the cell protoplasm and contribute to cell and body growth, while functional proteins control cell activity such as hormone production or nutrient metabolism. That makes sense. Structural proteins like actin help the cell grow and maintain structure. Functional proteins like enzymes and hormones regulate activities.

So I think the answer is G.

To distinguish between the two types of proteins produced by ribosomes, it is important to focus on their roles and characteristics. Structural proteins are primarily involved in providing structure and support to cells and tissues, such as collagen in connective tissue or actin in the cytoskeleton. These proteins are often part of the cell protoplasm and contribute to cell and body growth.

Functional proteins, on the other hand, are responsible for carrying out specific cellular activities. They include enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions, hormones that regulate various physiological processes, and proteins involved in nutrient metabolism. These proteins are typically globular and play a dynamic role in controlling cell activity.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** incorrectly states that structural proteins provide temporary functions, while functional proteins provide permanent structure. This is the opposite of their actual roles.
- **Option B** suggests that structural proteins control cell activity, which is not accurate since functional proteins are responsible for this.
- **Option C** reverses the roles, stating that structural proteins catalyze reactions and functional proteins provide structure, which is incorrect.
- **Option D** claims that structural proteins are soluble while functional proteins are insoluble, but this is not a consistent or accurate distinction.
- **Option E** incorrectly limits structural proteins to being outside the cell and functional proteins to being inside, when both types can be found in various locations.
- **Option F** overly narrows the roles of structural proteins to muscle contraction and functional proteins to energy production, which is incomplete.
- **Option G** correctly identifies that structural proteins are part of the cell protoplasm and contribute to growth, while functional proteins control activities like hormone production or nutrient metabolism. This aligns with the roles of these proteins.
- **Option H** incorrectly states that structural proteins cannot catalyze reactions and that functional proteins form ribosomes, which is not accurate.
- **Option I** incorrectly associates the synthesis of structural proteins with the cytoplasm and functional proteins with the nucleus, which is not correct since both are synthesized by ribosomes.
- **Option J** focuses on the location of ribosomes (free vs. membrane-bound) rather than the types of proteins themselves, which is not the focus of the question.

The correct answer is **Option G**, as it accurately distinguishes between structural and functional proteins based on their roles and characteristics.
