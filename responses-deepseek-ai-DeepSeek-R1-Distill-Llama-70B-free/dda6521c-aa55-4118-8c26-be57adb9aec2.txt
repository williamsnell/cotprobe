Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is: "Nonverbal and primarily nonculturally biased abilities are referred to as:" with options from A to J.

Hmm, okay, so I need to understand what each term means here. Let's break down the question. It's about abilities that are nonverbal and not much influenced by cultural bias. So, we're looking for a type of intelligence or ability that doesn't rely heavily on language or cultural knowledge.

I remember that in psychology, especially in the context of intelligence theories, there's a distinction between different types of intelligence. One major theory I recall is the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory, which divides intelligence into various levels. At the top is general intelligence, then broad abilities, and then narrow ones.

Fluid intelligence is a term I've heard before. From what I remember, fluid intelligence refers to the ability to think logically, solve problems in new situations, and think abstractly. It's more about raw cognitive power and isn't dependent on prior learning or culture. So fluid intelligence is nonverbal because it doesn't rely on language skills. It's also less culturally biased because it's not testing knowledge that's specific to a culture.

Looking at the options, option H is fluid intelligence. That seems like a good fit.

Let me think about the other options to make sure. Option B is crystallized intelligence, which I think is the opposite. Crystallized intelligence is about knowledge and skills learned over time, like vocabulary, which is culturally dependent and often verbal. So B doesn't fit.

Option C is abstract reasoning, which sounds similar to fluid intelligence, but I think that's more of a specific aspect rather than the term used here. The question is about a category of abilities, not a specific type of reasoning.

Option H, fluid intelligence, seems to be the correct answer because it's nonverbal and less influenced by culture. It's about the ability to reason and solve problems without relying on learned information.

The correct answer is H: Fluid intelligence. Fluid intelligence refers to the ability to think logically, solve problems in new situations, and reason abstractly without relying on prior learning or cultural knowledge. It is nonverbal and primarily nonculturally biased, making it the best fit for the question.

Answer: H
