Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the oscillations of argon atoms in a molecule. Hmm, I remember that when two atoms form a molecule like Ar₂, they're held together by some kind of intermolecular force, right? And in this case, it's a van der Waals interaction. 

The question gives me U₀ as 1.68e-21 J and R₀ as 3.82e-10 m. I need to find the frequency of small oscillations of one Ar atom about its equilibrium position. The options are given, and the unit is 1e11 Hz, so I'll need to calculate and then convert into that unit.

Wait, small oscillations... Oh right, that sounds like a harmonic oscillator approximation. So maybe I should model the atoms as masses connected by a spring. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², and the force is kx. But here, the potential is given by the van der Waals interaction. I think the van der Waals potential is usually something like U(r) = U₀ [ (R₀/r)^12 - 2 (R₀/r)^6 ] or something like that. But wait, no, actually, I think for the Morse potential or maybe the Lennard-Jones potential, but van der Waals is often considered as the attractive part at long distances. Oh, but in this problem, perhaps they're using a simplified form where the potential near equilibrium can be approximated as a harmonic oscillator.

So near the equilibrium point R₀, the potential can be approximated by expanding it in a Taylor series and keeping only up to the quadratic term. That way, we can treat it as a harmonic oscillator. So the first step is to find the 'spring constant' k for this system.

The potential U(r) around R₀ can be approximated as U(r) ≈ U₀ + (1/2) k (r - R₀)^2. Wait, but wait, the actual form of the van der Waals potential is more complex, I think. Maybe I should think of the general approach for any potential.

The general approach is that the force F(r) is the negative derivative of the potential U(r). The equilibrium is where F(r) = 0, which is at R₀. Then, the effective spring constant k is the second derivative of U(r) evaluated at R₀. Because for small oscillations, the restoring force is approximately F ≈ -k (r - R₀), leading to simple harmonic motion.

So, I need to compute the second derivative of U with respect to r, evaluated at r = R₀. Let's think about the van der Waals potential. Wait, the van der Waals interaction is often modeled as a Lennard-Jones potential, which is U(r) = 4ε [ (σ/r)^12 - (σ/r)^6 ], where ε is the depth of the potential well and σ is the distance where the potential is zero. But the problem gives U₀ and R₀. Hmm, maybe in this problem, U(r) is given as U(r) = U₀ [ (R₀/r)^12 - 2 (R₀/r)^6 ]? Or perhaps a different form. Alternatively, perhaps the van der Waals interaction is being considered as a simple two-term potential, where the first term is repulsive (r^12) and the second is attractive (r^6), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the given U₀ is the depth of the potential, so the potential might look like U(r) = U₀ [1 - (R₀/r)^6 ]^2 or something else. Wait, no, that would give a different form.

Wait, maybe the potential is given as U(r) = U₀ [ (R₀/r)^12 - 2 (R₀/r)^6 ]. Let me check: at r=R₀, the first term becomes 1, the second becomes 2. So U(R₀) = U₀ (1 - 2) = -U₀. So the potential minimum is at -U₀, which makes sense. So yes, that form makes sense. So U(r) = U₀ [ (R₀/r)^12 - 2 (R₀/r)^6 ].

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact form. Alternatively, perhaps the van der Waals potential is U(r) = - (C / r^6) + (B / r^12), but that's another way to write it. But the problem states that U₀ is the potential depth, so perhaps the minimum is at U₀. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential is modeled as U(r) = U₀ [ (R₀/(r - R₀))² - 1 ], but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that might not make sense dimensionally.

Wait, perhaps I should not get stuck on the exact form of U(r) and instead think about the general approach. The key is that for small oscillations around R₀, the potential can be approximated as a harmonic oscillator. So we can find the effective spring constant k by taking the second derivative of U with respect to r, evaluated at R₀.

So, let me proceed step by step.

1. The equilibrium separation is R₀ = 3.82e-10 m.

2. The potential U(r) has its minimum at R₀. So U'(R₀) = 0.

3. The effective spring constant k is given by k = U''(R₀).

So I need to compute the second derivative of U(r) with respect to r at r = R₀.

But wait, I need to know the exact form of U(r). Since the problem gives U₀ and R₀, maybe it's a Morse potential. Alternatively, perhaps they're considering a simplified form where U(r) = U₀ * (1 - (r/R₀)^2 )² or something else. Hmm, but without knowing the exact form, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the Lennard-Jones potential. Let me recall: the Lennard-Jones potential is U(r) = 4ε [ (σ/r)^12 - (σ/r)^6 ], where ε is the depth of the potential well (the minimum value of U is -ε) and σ is the distance at which U(r)=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential is being approximated as U(r) = U₀ [ (R₀/r)^n - m (R₀/r)^m ] or something like that. But without knowing the exact form, perhaps I can find another approach.

Wait, another approach: the problem gives U₀ as the potential depth. The minimum of U(r) is U₀. So perhaps the potential can be written as U(r) = U₀ [ (R₀ / r)^12 - 2 (R₀ / r)^6 ] because that would give U(R₀) = U₀ (1 - 2) = -U₀, implying that the minimum is -U₀. So, that might make sense.

Assuming that U(r) = U₀ [ (R₀ / r)^12 - 2 (R₀ / r)^6 ], then I can compute the derivatives.

Let me write U(r) as:

U(r) = U₀ [ (R₀/r)^12 - 2 (R₀/r)^6 ]

Let me compute U'(r), which is dU/dr.

Compute dU/dr:

dU/dr = U₀ [ d/dr ( (R₀/r)^12 ) - 2 d/dr ( (R₀/r)^6 ) ]

Let me compute each derivative.

Let’s denote (R₀/r)^n as R₀^n * r^(-n).

So, d/dr (r^(-n)) = -n r^(-n-1) = -n / r^(n+1).

So,

d/dr (R₀/r)^12 = R₀^12 * (-12) r^(-13) = -12 R₀^12 / r^13.

Similarly, d/dr (R₀/r)^6 = R₀^6 * (-6) r^(-7) = -6 R₀^6 / r^7.

So putting it all together:

U’(r) = U₀ [ (-12 R₀^12 / r^13) - 2*(-6 R₀^6 / r^7) ) ]

Simplify:

= U₀ [ (-12 R₀^12 / r^13 ) + 12 R₀^6 / r^7 ]

Now, evaluate U’(r) at r = R₀.

At r=R₀:

U’(R₀) = U₀ [ (-12 R₀^12 / R₀^13 ) + 12 R₀^6 / R₀^7 ) ]

Simplify each term:

-12 R₀^12 / R₀^13 = -12 / R₀

12 R₀^6 / R₀^7 = 12 / R₀

So,

U’(R₀) = U₀ [ (-12 / R₀ ) + (12 / R₀ ) ] = U₀ [0] = 0.

Which confirms that R₀ is the equilibrium point.

Now, compute the second derivative U''(r) to get the spring constant k.

So, U’(r) = U₀ [ (-12 R₀^12 / r^13 ) + 12 R₀^6 / r^7 ]

So, U''(r) is the derivative of U’(r):

U''(r) = U₀ [ d/dr (-12 R₀^12 r^(-13) ) + d/dr (12 R₀^6 r^(-7) ) ]

Compute each term:

d/dr (-12 R₀^12 r^(-13) ) = (-12 R₀^12 ) * (-13) r^(-14) = 156 R₀^12 / r^14.

Similarly, d/dr (12 R₀^6 r^(-7) ) = 12 R₀^6 * (-7) r^(-8) = -84 R₀^6 / r^8.

So,

U''(r) = U₀ [ (156 R₀^12 ) / r^14 - 84 R₀^6 / r^8 ]

Now evaluate this at r = R₀:

U''(R₀) = U₀ [ 156 R₀^12 / R₀^14 - 84 R₀^6 / R₀^8 ]

Simplify each term:

156 R₀^12 / R₀^14 = 156 / R₀^2

84 R₀^6 / R₀^8 = 84 / R₀^2

So,

U''(R₀) = U₀ [ (156 - 84) / R₀^2 ] = U₀ (72 / R₀² )

So, k = U''(R₀) = (72 U₀) / R₀².

Now, with k known, the angular frequency ω of oscillation is sqrt(k/m), where m is the reduced mass of the system. But since both atoms are Ar, each has mass m = atomic mass of Ar times the atomic mass unit.

Wait, the atomic mass of Ar is approximately 40 atomic mass units (since Ar is argon, atomic number 18, and its standard atomic weight is about 39.948, so approx 40 u). Each argon atom has mass m = 40 u. Since the molecule is diatomic, the reduced mass μ is (m * m)/(m + m) )= m²/(2m) )= m/2.

Wait, no, the reduced mass for two identical masses is each mass multiplied by the other, divided by the sum. So μ = (m1 * m2)/(m1 + m2) ). Since m1 = m2 = m, μ = m²/(2m) )= m/2. So yes, μ = m/2.

So m is the mass of one Ar atom, which is 40 u. Let me compute that in kilograms.

1 u (atomic mass unit) is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m = 40 u = 40 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 6.642e-26 kg.

So μ = m/2 = 3.321e-26 kg.

Now, the angular frequency ω is sqrt(k/μ).

Wait, so ω = sqrt( (72 U₀ / R₀² ) / μ )

We can plug in the numbers.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute k = (72 U₀) / R₀².

U₀ is given as 1.68e-21 J.

R₀ is 3.82e-10 m.

So,

R₀² = (3.82e-10)^2 = let me compute that: 3.82 squared is about 14.5924, so 14.5924e-20 m².

So,

k = 72 * 1.68e-21 J / (14.5924e-20 m² )

Compute numerator: 72 * 1.68e-21 = let's compute 72 * 1.68 first.

72 * 1.68 = 120.96 → so 120.96e-21 J.

Denominator: 14.5924e-20 m².

So,

k = 120.96e-21 / 14.5924e-20 = (120.96 / 14.5924) * (1e-21 / 1e-20 )

Compute 120.96 / 14.5924 ≈ let me compute 14.5924 * 8 = 116.7392. 120.96 -116.7392=4.2208 → so approximately 8.29.

Wait,

14.5924 * 8 = 116.7392.

120.96 -116.7392=4.2208.

Now 4.2208 /14.5924 ≈ 0.289.

So 8.289.

So 8.289 * (1e-21 / 1e-20 ) → because 1e-21 / 1e-20 is 0.1, so 8.289 * 0.1 = 0.8289.

So k ≈ 0.8289 N/m.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation more accurately.

Compute 72 * 1.68e-21 = 72 * 1.68 = 120.96 → 120.96e-21 J.

R₀ squared is (3.82e-10)^2 = (3.82)^2=14.5924, so 14.5924e-20 m².

So,

k = 120.96e-21 J / 14.5924e-20 m² = (120.96 / 14.5924) * (1e-21 / 1e-20) → (120.96/14.5924) * (1e-1).

Calculate 120.96 / 14.5924:

14.5924 * 8 = 116.7392.

120.96 -116.7392 =4.2208.

4.2208 /14.5924 ≈ 0.2893.

So 8 + 0.2893=8.2893.

Multiply by 1e-1: 0.82893.

So k ≈ 0.82893 N/m.

Now, μ is 3.321e-26 kg.

So, angular frequency ω = sqrt(k/μ) = sqrt(0.82893 / 3.321e-26 )

Compute 0.82893 /3.321e-26 ≈ 0.82893 /3.321 ≈ 0.2497 → 0.2497e26 → 2.497e25.

Wait, no, 0.82893 / 3.321e-26 → it's (0.82893) / (3.321e-26) ) = (0.82893 /3.321 ) * 1e26.

0.82893 ÷3.321 ≈ 0.2497.

So, 0.2497 * 1e26 = 2.497e25.

So, sqrt(2.497e25) → sqrt(2.497e25) = sqrt(2.497) * 1e12.5.

Wait, because sqrt(1e25) is 1e12.5, which is 1e12 * sqrt(10) ≈3.1623e12.

Compute sqrt(2.497) ≈ 1.58.

So, ω ≈ 1.58 * 3.1623e12 → approx 5e12 rad/s.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 2.497e25:

sqrt(2.497e25) = sqrt(2.497) * sqrt(1e25) = 1.5801 * 1e12.5.

1e12.5 is 1e12 * sqrt(10) ≈3.16228e12.

So 1.5801 *3.16228e12 ≈ 1.5801 *3.16228 ≈5.0 (since 1.58 *3 is ~4.74, 1.58*0.16228≈0.256, total ~4.996 → ~5e12 rad/s.

Wait, that's the angular frequency.

But we're asked for the frequency f, which is ω/(2π).

So f = ω/(2π) → 5e12 rad/s / (2π) → 5e12/(6.2832) ≈ 7.96e11 Hz.

Wait, but the options are all around 1e11 Hz, so perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, let me recheck all steps because that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the exponents earlier.

Let me recalculate k.

k = 72 U₀ / R₀².

U₀ = 1.68e-21 J.

R₀ = 3.82e-10 m, so R₀² = (3.82)^2e-20 = 14.5924e-20 m² = 1.45924e-19 m².

Wait, no: (3.82e-10)^2 = (3.82)^2 * (1e-10)^2 = 14.5924 * 1e-20 = 1.45924e-19 m².

So,

k = (72 * 1.68e-21) / (1.45924e-19 )

Compute numerator:72 *1.68e-21 = 120.96e-21 =1.2096e-19 J.

So,

k = 1.2096e-19 J / 1.45924e-19 m² → (1.2096 /1.45924 ) → approx 0.829 N/m.

So that's correct.

Now, μ is 3.321
