Question:

A builder sold a new house to a buyer for use as the buyer's residence. The buyer paid 10% of the purchase price and financed the rest by executing a promissory note and purchase money mortgage to the builder. A year later, the buyer missed several mortgage payments to the builder and became unable to make payments to the builder and became unable to make payments. During that year, property values in the neighborhood declined substantially. The builder suggested that the buyer deed the house back to the builder to settle all claims and avoid the costs and other disadvantages of foreclosure. The buyer deeded the house back to the builder. Does the builder now own fee simple title to the house?

Options:

A: No, because the builder cannot accept the deed while also holding the mortgage.
B: No, because the owner of a personal residence cannot waive the right to foreclosure.
C: Yes, because the transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances.
D: No, because the builder coerced the buyer into deeding the house back.
E: Yes, because the buyer defaulted on the mortgage payments.
F: Yes, because the builder originally held the mortgage.
G: Yes, because of the doctrine of equitable redemption.
H: No, because the buyer still technically owns the house until foreclosure.
I: No, because the deed back to the builder constitutes a disguised mortgage.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate question. Let's see what the scenario is. 

The builder sold a new house to a buyer as a residence. The buyer paid 10% and financed the rest with a promissory note and a purchase money mortgage. So, the builder is both the seller and the mortgagee. A year later, the buyer misses payments and can't make them anymore, and property values have gone down. The builder suggests that the buyer deed the house back to settle all claims and avoid foreclosure. The buyer does that. Now, does the builder own the house outright?

Hmm. So, I'm a bit rusty on real estate law, but I remember something about deeds in lieu of foreclosure. I think that when a borrower can't pay, the lender can accept a deed to the property instead of foreclosing. This is called a deed in lieu. But wait, is that always valid, especially when the property is the buyer's residence?

I remember that in some cases, especially with residential property, there are protections for the borrower. Like, the lender can't just take the property without going through foreclosure unless certain conditions are met. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Looking at the options, option I says no because it's a disguised mortgage. Wait, what's a disguised mortgage? I think that's when a transaction looks like a sale but is actually a loan. Like, if the seller takes a security interest in the property. But in this case, the builder already had a mortgage. So when the buyer deeds it back, is that treated as a mortgage or a sale?

Another point: the buyer is deeding the property back, so that should transfer ownership. But I remember something about the doctrine of equitable redemption, which allows the borrower to redeem the property even after foreclosure. Option G says yes because of that, but wait, equitable redemption usually applies after foreclosure. If the buyer gave the deed voluntarily, does that doctrine still apply?

Wait, no, the doctrine of equitable redemption is more about the borrower's right to get the property back by paying off the loan after default but before foreclosure. If the borrower gives the deed, that might be a different situation.

What about option C: yes, because the transaction was reasonable and fair. So, if the builder and buyer agree to this, and it's done fairly, the builder would own the property. But are there any legal barriers to that?

Option I suggests it's a disguised mortgage. So, if the builder accepts the deed, does that mean the original debt is still in place, making it a mortgage? Or does it actually transfer ownership? I think a deed in lieu of foreclosure is considered a transfer of title, not a mortgage. So option I might not be correct.

Option A says no because the builder can't accept the deed while holding the mortgage. But I think that's not right. The builder can accept the deed to satisfy the mortgage. It's a way to avoid foreclosure.

Option D says no because of coercion. But the question doesn't state that the builder coerced the buyer, just suggested it. So unless there's evidence of coercion, D might not be applicable.

Option E says yes because the buyer defaulted. But defaulting doesn't automatically transfer ownership; foreclosure is usually needed. Unless the buyer gives the deed, which they did here.

So, putting it together: when a buyer deeds the property back to the lender (here, the builder) in lieu of foreclosure, the lender gets title. But in some states, especially for residential property, there might be requirements. But the question doesn't mention any specific laws preventing this.

Wait, but I also remember that in some cases, if the property's value has declined, the lender might be better off foreclosing to get a deficiency judgment. But here, they agreed to settle all claims, so deficiency might not be an issue.

So the main issue is whether the deed in lieu is valid. If it's done properly, the builder would own the house. So the answer should be yes. Looking at the options, option C says yes because it's reasonable and fair. So I think that's the right choice.

The scenario involves a builder who sold a house to a buyer for residential use, with the buyer paying 10% of the purchase price and financing the rest through a promissory note and purchase money mortgage. When the buyer defaulted on mortgage payments and property values declined, the builder suggested deeding the house back to avoid foreclosure. The buyer agreed, and the question is whether the builder now owns fee simple title to the house.

Key points to consider:

1. **Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure**: A deed in lieu allows a borrower to transfer ownership of the property to the lender to satisfy the debt, avoiding foreclosure. This is a valid transaction if done fairly and voluntarily.

2. **Disguised Mortgage (Option I)**: A disguised mortgage occurs when a transaction appears to be a sale but is actually a loan. Here, the builder already held a mortgage, and the buyer voluntarily deeded the property back. This does not constitute a disguised mortgage.

3. **Doctrine of Equitable Redemption (Option G)**: This doctrine allows a borrower to redeem the property by paying off the loan after default but before foreclosure. It does not apply here because the buyer voluntarily transferred the deed.

4. **Coercion (Option D)**: The question does not provide evidence of coercion; the builder merely suggested the deed in lieu, and the buyer agreed.

5. **Reasonableness and Fairness (Option C)**: If the transaction was reasonable and fair, the builder would own the property. The facts suggest the transaction was voluntary and intended to settle all claims.

6. **Default and Ownership (Option E)**: Defaulting on payments does not automatically transfer ownership. However, the buyer's voluntary deed transfer does.

Given these considerations, the builder now owns fee simple title to the house because the transaction was reasonable and fair under the circumstances.
