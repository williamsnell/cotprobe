Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about converting temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin. Hmm, I remember that Kelvin and Celsius are related, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conversion. Let me think through this step by step.

The question asks to express 20°C and -5°C on the Kelvin scale. So I need to find the Kelvin equivalents for both of these temperatures.

Wait, I think the conversion formula is something like Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15. Oh right, because 0 degrees Celsius is equal to 273.15 Kelvin. So to convert Celsius to Kelvin, you just add 273.15 to the Celsius temperature.

Let me apply that. Starting with 20°C. Adding 273.15 to 20, that would be 293.15 K. But looking at the options, I don't see 293.15 exactly. Wait, maybe they round it. So 293 K when rounded. Or perhaps 293.15 is written as 293 K. Let's keep that in mind.

Now for -5°C. Hmm, adding 273.15 to -5. Let me do the math. 273.15 minus 5 is 268.15, so that would be approximately 268.15 K, which I guess is rounded to 268 K.

So the two Kelvin temperatures are 293 K and 268 K. Now I need to look at the options to find which one matches these two values.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 310K and 260K → 310 is way higher than 293, so no.

Option B: 280 and 268. 280 is lower than 293, nope.

Option C: 273 and 248. 273 is 0°C, so 20°C should be higher. 273 is too low, so no.

Option D: 303 and 258. 303 is 30°C plus 273 (303 is 30+273=303), but our first value is 293, which is 20+273. So 303 is too high.

Option E: 290 and 250. 290 is 17°C (because 273+17=290), which is close to 20, but not exact. Wait, 20+273 is 293, so this is a bit off.

Option F: 293 and 268. Oh wait, that matches exactly what I calculated. 293 K and 268 K.

Option G: 295 and 275. 295 would be 22°C, which is a bit higher than 20, so not it.

Option H: 293 and 278. 278 would be 4.85°C (since 278-273=5, approx). But we have -5°C, which is 268, so no.

Option I: 285 and 263. 285 is 12°C, which is lower than 20, so no.

Option J: 300 and 270. 300 is 27°C, which is higher than 20, so no.

So the correct option is F, which has both 293K and 268K. That matches our calculations.

To convert temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin, the formula used is:

\[
K = °C + 273.15
\]

1. For \( 20°C \):  
   \[
   20 + 273.15 = 293.15 \, \text{K} \approx 293 \, \text{K}
   \]

2. For \( -5°C \):  
   \[
   -5 + 273.15 = 268.15 \, \text{K} \approx 268 \, \text{K}
   \]

Thus, the Kelvin equivalents are approximately \( 293 \, \text{K} \) and \( 268 \, \text{K} \). Comparing these values to the options provided, the correct choice is:

**F: 293K and 268K**
