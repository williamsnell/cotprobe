Question:

As a legislative aide to a U. S. Senator you are called upon to provide an analysis of the constitutionality of a bill pending congressional approval. The bill imposes a 15% tax upon the gross annual receipts from the sales of all birth control devices. The bill has the strong support of conservative and pro-life organizations. The stated purpose of the proposed measure is to raise revenue and spur population growth across the country. In your learned opinion, the proposed tax is probably

Options:

A: constitutional, because the fact that the tax applies to all sales of every type of birth control device invalidates any possible objection to the tax on the grounds that it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
B: unconstitutional, because it infringes on the rights of businesses to operate freely in the market.
C: unconstitutional, because it unfairly targets a specific industry, which violates the principle of fair trade.
D: unconstitutional, because in inseverable aggregates, the domestic purchases and sales of birth control devices affect interstate and foreign commerce.
E: unconstitutional, because it may disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who rely on these devices for family planning.
F: constitutional, because the tax applies universally to all forms of birth control devices, and thus does not single out any particular group or entity for discrimination.
G: constitutional, because it is within the government's rights to levy taxes to generate revenue, regardless of the potential social implications.
H: unconstitutional, because the tax burdens the fundamental right to privacy of users of birth control devices without establishing a compelling national interest for doing so.
I: constitutional, because the government has the power to tax as a means of controlling population growth.
J: constitutional, because the fact that controversial policy motives may have induced the enactment of an otherwise reasonable measure calculated to raise revenue does not ipso facto invalidate the tax.

Okay, so I've got this question about constitutional law, specifically concerning a proposed bill that imposes a 15% tax on the gross annual receipts from the sales of all birth control devices. The question is asking whether this tax is constitutional, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I remember that the Constitution gives Congress the power to tax, but there are limits. Taxes can't violate other constitutional principles, like equal protection or substantive due process.

The bill's stated purpose is to raise revenue and spur population growth. So, the government is using taxation to influence behavior, which isn't uncommon. For example, taxes on cigarettes aim to reduce smoking. But this one is about birth control, which touches on privacy rights.

I recall the Supreme Court case Griswold v. Connecticut, where the Court held that the right to privacy includes the right to use birth control. So, if this tax makes birth control more expensive, it could burden that right. The question is whether such a burden is constitutional.

Under the Constitution, when a law burdens a fundamental right, the government must show a compelling interest and that the law is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. This is the strict scrutiny standard. So, does this tax pass strict scrutiny?

The tax applies to all sales of birth control devices. The options suggest different arguments. Option H says it's unconstitutional because it burdens the right to privacy without a compelling interest. Option E talks about lower-income individuals being disproportionately affected, which is an equal protection issue.

Wait, the equal protection clause is part of the 14th Amendment. If the tax applies equally to everyone, maybe there's no equal protection violation. But if it disproportionately affects certain groups, like the poor, then it might be a problem. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option H seems more about the fundamental right to privacy. The tax could make it harder for people to afford birth control, thus infringing on their right. The government's purpose here is to raise revenue and increase population. Are those compelling enough to justify the burden on privacy? I don't think so. The Supreme Court has been protective of reproductive rights, so a tax that directly impacts access might be seen as an undue burden.

Another angle: the commerce clause. Option D mentions that domestic purchases affect interstate commerce. Congress can regulate economic activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. But the question is about the constitutionality of the tax, not the commerce clause power. So maybe that's not the right path.

Option A suggests that because the tax applies to all sales, it doesn't violate equal protection. But equal protection isn't the main issue here; it's the burden on a fundamental right. So A might not be the right choice.

Option G says it's constitutional because the government can tax for revenue. But the issue isn't the power to tax; it's whether the tax violates other rights.

Option J argues that even if the motives are controversial, the tax is otherwise reasonable. But the problem is the impact on fundamental rights, not just the motive.

Putting it all together, the tax likely burdens the fundamental right to privacy without a compelling government interest. So the correct answer should be H.

The proposed tax on birth control devices raises concerns about its constitutionality, particularly regarding its impact on fundamental rights. The right to privacy, including the use of birth control, is a well-established fundamental right under Griswold v. Connecticut. When a law burdens such a right, the government must demonstrate a compelling interest and show that the law is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. 

The bill's purpose—to raise revenue and spur population growth—does not constitute a compelling interest sufficient to justify the burden it places on access to birth control. By increasing the cost of birth control, the tax could effectively infringe upon individuals' ability to exercise their right to privacy. 

While other options address issues like equal protection or the commerce clause, the central constitutional concern lies in the tax's impact on the fundamental right to privacy. Therefore, the tax is likely unconstitutional because it burdens this right without meeting the strict scrutiny standard.
