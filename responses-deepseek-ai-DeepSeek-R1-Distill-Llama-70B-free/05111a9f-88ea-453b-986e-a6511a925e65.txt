Okay, so I've got this problem about the rotational spectrum of HF, and I need to find the moment of inertia and the bond length. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, I remember that the rotational spectrum of a diatomic molecule is related to its moment of inertia. The spacing between the lines in the rotational spectrum gives us the rotational constant, which is related to the moment of inertia. Oh right, the formula for the spacing between lines is 2B, where B is the rotational constant. Wait, no, wait. I think the spacing is equal to 2B in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1). Or is it just B? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, I think the spacing between adjacent lines in the rotational spectrum is 2B. Because the lines are at positions 2B, 4B, 6B, etc. So the difference between them is 2B. So if the spacing is 41.9 cm^-1, then 2B = 41.9, so B would be 20.95 cm^-1.

But wait, sometimes the rotational constant is given as B = h/(8π²cI), where I is the moment of inertia. So knowing B, I can find I. That makes sense.

So the formula for the rotational constant B is B = h/(8π²cI). Rearranging for I, we get I = h/(8π²cB).

Wait, but let me make sure. Planck's constant h is 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is approximately 3 × 10^10 cm/s (since 1 m is 100 cm, so 3e8 m/s is 3e10 cm/s). Pi is about 3.1416.

So plugging in the numbers:

I = (6.626e-34) / (8 * (3.1416)^2 * 3e10 * 20.95)

Wait, let's compute the denominator step by step. 8 times pi squared is first. 3.1416 squared is about 9.8696. Multiply by 8: 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

Then multiply by c, which is 3e10 cm/s: 78.9568 * 3e10 = 2.3689e12.

Then multiply by B, which is 20.95 cm^-1: 2.3689e12 * 20.95 ≈ 4.964e13.

So denominator is approximately 4.964e13.

Now numerator is 6.626e-34.

So I = 6.626e-34 / 4.964e13 = (6.626 / 4.964) × 1e-47.

6.626 divided by 4.964 is roughly 1.335. So I ≈ 1.335e-47 kg·m².

Wait, but wait a second. Units? Because c is in cm/s, and B is in cm^-1. Let me think about the units.

Alternatively, maybe I should express everything in meters. Because in SI units, c is about 3e8 m/s. Let me try that approach.

Wait, B is given in cm^-1, which is 100 m^-1. So if B is 20.95 cm^-1, that's 2095 m^-1.

Wait, no, wait: 1 cm^-1 is 100 m^-1. So 20.95 cm^-1 is 20.95 × 100 = 2095 m^-1.

So maybe I should recalculate with B in m^-1.

So I = h/(8 π² c B).

h=6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s, B=2095 m^-1.

Compute denominator: 8 * pi^2 * c * B.

8 * (3.1416)^2 ≈ 78.9568 as before.

So denominator: 78.9568 * 3e8 m/s * 2095 m^-1.

Wait, let's compute that.

3e8 * 2095 = 6.2835e11.

Multiply by 78.9568: 6.2835e11 * 78.9568 ≈ 4.964e13.

So denominator is 4.964e13.

Numerator: 6.626e-34.

So I = 6.626e-34 / 4.964e13 = 1.335e-47 kg·m².

Wait, same as before. So that's the moment of inertia.

Now, for the bond length. The moment of inertia I is given by I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

So I need to find μ first. The reduced mass μ is (m_H * m_F) / (m_H + m_F).

But I need the masses in kg. The atomic masses: H is about 1.00784 u, F is about 18.9984 u.

Wait, 1 u is 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m_H = 1.00784 u * 1.6605e-27 kg/u = approx 1.6736e-27 kg.

m_F = 18.9984 u * 1.6605e-27 kg/u = let's compute that: 18.9984 * 1.6605e-27.

18.9984 * 1.6605 ≈ 31.56, so m_F ≈ 3.156e-26 kg.

So μ = (1.6736e-27 kg * 3.156e-26 kg) / (1.6736e-27 + 3.156e-26).

Denominator: 1.6736e-27 + 3.156e-26 = approx 3.3236e-26 kg.

Numerator: 1.6736e-27 * 3.156e-26 = approx (1.6736 * 3.156)e-53 = about 5.284e-53.

So μ = 5.284e-53 / 3.3236e-26 = approx 1.589e-27 kg.

Wait wait, let me calculate that again. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait m_H is 1.00784 u, m_F is 18.9984 u.

μ = (m_H * m_F) / (m_H + m_F) = (1.00784 * 18.9984) / (1.00784 + 18.9984) u.

Compute numerator: 1.00784 * 18.9984 ≈ let's see: 1 * 19 is 19, so 0.00784 * 19 is about 0.149, so total around 19.149.

Denominator: 1.00784 + 18.9984 = 20.00624 u.

So μ ≈ 19.149 / 20.00624 u ≈ 0.9569 u.

Convert μ to kg: 0.9569 u * 1.6605e-27 kg/u ≈ 1.589e-27 kg.

Wait, that's the same as before.

Now, I = μ r².

We have I as 1.335e-47 kg m².

So r² = I / μ = (1.335e-47 kg m²) / (1.589e-27 kg) = approx 8.4e-21 m².

r = sqrt(8.4e-21) = approx 9.165e-11 m. Which is 9.165e-2 nm, or 0.9165 angstroms? Wait, wait. Because 1 m is 1e9 nm, so 9.165e-11 m is 0.9165e-1 nm, which is 9.165e-2 nm, which is 0.9165 angstroms. Hmm, but wait, I thought HF bond length is about 0.92 angstroms, which is 9.2e-11 m, or 9.2e-2 nm.

Wait, so my calculation gives around 9.16e-2 nm, which is about 0.916 nm? Wait no, wait units again. 9.16e-2 nm is 0.0916 nm, which is 9.16e-11 m. Oh wait, no, wait 1 nm is 1e-9 m, so 9.16e-2 nm is 9.16e-11 m, which is 0.916 angstroms. That makes sense because HF's bond length is around 0.92 Å.

So the bond length is approximately 9.16e-2 nm, which is 0.916 nm? Wait no, no. Wait, 9.16e-2 nm is 0.0916 nm, which is 9.16e-11 m. Oh wait, that's 0.916 Å, correct.

So looking at the options, let's see.

The moment of inertia I was calculated as ~1.335e-47 kg m², and bond length r ~9.16e-2 nm.

Looking at the options:

Option G: I=1.336e-47 kg m², r=9.196e-2 nm.

Wait, 9.196e-2 nm is 0.9196 nm? No, wait 9.196e-2 nm is 0.09196 nm, which is 9.196e-11 m, or 0.9196 Å. That's very close to our calculation.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, 9.196e-2 nm is 0.09196 nm, which is 9.196e-11 m. But in the options, the choices are given as 9.196 ×10^-2 nm, which would be 0.09196 nm, yes.

So I think option G is the correct one: I=1.336e-47 kg m², r=9.196e-2 nm.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, I had the moment of inertia I as 1.335e-47 kg m², which matches option G's 1.336e-47. And bond length as approximately 9.16e-2 nm, which is 0.0916 nm, which is 9.16e-11 m. Option G gives 9.196e-2 nm, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be G.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the rotational spectrum of HF. The spacing between adjacent lines in the rotational spectrum is given as 41.9 cm⁻¹. This spacing corresponds to \( 2B \), where \( B \) is the rotational constant. Therefore, \( B = \frac{41.9}{2} = 20.95 \, \text{cm}^{-1} \).

The rotational constant \( B \) is related to the moment of inertia \( I \) by the formula:

\[
B = \frac{h}{8 \pi^2 c I}
\]

Rearranging for \( I \), we get:

\[
I = \frac{h}{8 \pi^2 c B}
\]

Substituting the known values:
- Planck's constant \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \),
- Speed of light \( c = 3.0 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \),
- Rotational constant \( B = 20.95 \, \text{cm}^{-1} \),

we calculate the denominator:

\[
8 \pi^2 c B = 8 \cdot (3.1416)^2 \cdot 3.0 \times 10^{10} \cdot 20.95
\]

First, \( 8 \cdot (3.1416)^2 \approx 78.9568 \). Then:

\[
78.9568 \cdot 3.0 \times 10^{10} = 2.3689 \times 10^{12}
\]

\[
2.3689 \times 10^{12} \cdot 20.95 = 4.964 \times 10^{13}
\]

Now, calculate \( I \):

\[
I = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{4.964 \times 10^{13}} = 1.335 \times 10^{-47} \, \text{kg·m}^2
\]

This matches the moment of inertia given in option G.

Next, to find the bond length \( r \), we use the relationship between the moment of inertia and the reduced mass \( \mu \):

\[
I = \mu r^2
\]

The reduced mass \( \mu \) for HF is calculated as:

\[
\mu = \frac{m_H \cdot m_F}{m_H + m_F}
\]

Using atomic masses:
- \( m_H = 1.00784 \, \text{u} = 1.6736 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \),
- \( m_F = 18.9984 \, \text{u} = 3.156 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg} \),

we find:

\[
\mu = \frac{(1.6736 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (3.156 \times 10^{-26})}{1.6736 \times 10^{-27} + 3.156 \times 10^{-26}} = 1.589 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
\]

Now, solve for \( r \):

\[
r = \sqrt{\frac{I}{\mu}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.335 \times 10^{-47}}{1.589 \times 10^{-27}}}
\]

\[
r \approx 9.16 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m} = 9.16 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{nm}
\]

This bond length is very close to the value \( 9.196 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{nm} \) given in option G.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**G: \( 1.336 \times 10^{-47} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \) and \( 9.196 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{nm} \)**.

Answer: G
