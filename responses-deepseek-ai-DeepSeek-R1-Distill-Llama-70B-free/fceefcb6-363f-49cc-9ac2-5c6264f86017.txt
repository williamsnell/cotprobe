Okay, so I have this division problem here: 7,285 divided by 4. Hmm, I need to find the correct answer from the given options. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I'll try to do the division step by step. I remember that when dividing, you start from the leftmost digit and see how many times the divisor can go into it, then move to the next digit, and so on.

So, the dividend is 7,285 and the divisor is 4. Let me write this out as a long division problem.

4 | 7,285

I'll start with the first digit, which is 7. How many times does 4 go into 7? Well, 4 times 1 is 4, and 4 times 2 is 8, which is too big. So it goes in once. I write 1 above the 7, subtract 4 from 7, which leaves 3.

Now, bring down the next digit, which is 2, making it 32. How many times does 4 go into 32? Let me think, 4 times 8 is 32 exactly. So I put 8 next to the 1, making the quotient so far 18. Subtract 32 from 32, which leaves 0.

Next, bring down the 8. Now, how many times does 4 go into 8? Exactly 2 times. So I add a 2, making the quotient 182. Subtract 8 from 8, which leaves 0.

Now, bring down the 5. How many times does 4 go into 5? Once again, 4 times 1 is 4. Subtract 4 from 5, which leaves a remainder of 1.

So putting it all together, the quotient is 1,821 with a remainder of 1. Wait, wait, but let me check that again. Because 4 times 1,821 is... let's calculate that to make sure.

Calculating 1,821 multiplied by 4: 1,800 *4 is 7,200, and 21*4 is 84. Adding them gives 7,284. Oh, wait, but the dividend is 7,285. So 7,284 is 1 less than 7,285, meaning the remainder is 1. So yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches. The options are:

A: 1,821

B: 1,811 R1

C: 1,801

D: 1,811

E: 1,831 R1

F: 1,821 R2

G: 1,831

H: 1,801 R2

I: 1,801 R1

J: 1,821 R1

So the quotient is 1,821 with a remainder of 1. So the correct answer should have 1,821 and R1. Looking through the options, option J is 1,821 R1, and option F is 1,821 R2. So the remainder is 1, so option J is correct.

Wait a second, did I make a mistake in the remainder? Let me double-check the division. So 4 times 1,821 is 7,284. 7,285 minus 7,284 is indeed 1. So remainder is 1. So option J is the right one.

The division of 7,285 by 4 yields a quotient of 1,821 with a remainder of 1. This matches option J.
