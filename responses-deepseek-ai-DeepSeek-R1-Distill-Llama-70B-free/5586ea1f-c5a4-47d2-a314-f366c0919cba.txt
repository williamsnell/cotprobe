Question:

A state is the only state that imposes a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely

Options:

A: valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.
B: invalid, because the Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, which includes the extraction of resources.
C: valid, because the state has the right to impose taxes on resources, regardless of federal legislation.
D: valid, because Congress does not have the power to regulate state taxation.
E: valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.
F: invalid, because Congress has the power to regulate all forms of energy production.
G: invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.
H: invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.
I: valid, because the state has the right to tax resources found within its borders.
J: invalid, because the state cannot tax a resource that is vital to the national economy.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this constitutional law question about whether a state's tax on pitchblende extraction is valid after Congress passed a law forbidding such taxes. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the Constitution has the Supremacy Clause, which says that federal law is the highest law of the land. So if a state law conflicts with a federal law, the federal one takes precedence. That makes me think that if Congress has the authority to pass the law, the state tax might be invalid.

The question says that pitchblende is crucial for the national economy because it's a source of uranium and plutonium, which are used for atomic energy. So the federal interest here is probably high. Now, what powers does Congress have that could allow them to regulate this? Well, one major power is the Commerce Clause, which lets Congress regulate interstate commerce. Even though pitchblende isn't mined in other states, the products derived from it (like uranium and plutonium) might be part of interstate commerce. So Congress could argue that regulating the extraction affects interstate commerce.

Another thought: does Congress have the power under the Commerce Clause to prohibit state taxation in this area? I recall cases where the Supreme Court has ruled that states can't tax in ways that unduly burden interstate commerce. But here, it's the federal government stopping the state from taxing. So maybe Congress is using its Commerce power to prevent state interference with a nationally important resource.

Option B says the tax is invalid because Congress can regulate interstate commerce, including extraction. That sounds plausible. But wait, the extraction itself is intrastate, right? The mining happens within one state. But the downstream effects on energy production and national security might tie into interstate commerce.

Option G mentions the plenary power over interstate commerce and the Supremacy Clause. Plenary means absolute, so if Congress's action falls under their Commerce power, the state law must yield. That makes sense because the Supremacy Clause would make the federal law override the state tax.

Option E suggests Congress can't treat states unequally. But here, the law applies to all states, even though only one is affected. So it's not an equal protection issue but rather a commerce issue.

Option F says Congress can regulate all energy production. I'm not sure if that's a specific enumerated power or if it's part of the Commerce Clause. Energy production might relate to commerce, but the broader point is whether Congress can regulate it through the Commerce power.

Option J argues that the state can't tax something vital to the national economy. But states do tax all sorts of things that are nationally important, like gasoline or income. So that's probably not the right reason.

So, putting it together: the federal law is based on the Commerce Clause, and because of the Supremacy Clause, the state tax is invalid. So the correct answer should be either B or G. Between those, G says when Congress uses its plenary power, the state action is void. But does Congress have plenary power over interstate commerce here?

Wait, plenary power usually refers to areas like immigration or foreign policy where Congress's authority is exclusive. Interstate commerce is a shared power, so maybe G is stretching it. Alternatively, B is more about the Commerce Clause in general.

Hmm, but the question says the federal law only affects this one state because others don't mine pitchblende. Does that matter? Probably not, because Congress's power under the Commerce Clause can be exercised even if it affects one state, as long as it's related to interstate commerce.

So I'm leaning towards option G, but I'm a bit confused about the plenary part. Alternatively, option B might be more accurate because it's about Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause.

Wait, another angle: can Congress use its Commerce power to prohibit state taxation? I think yes. For example, in cases where state taxes burden interstate commerce, Congress can step in. So if the tax on extraction affects the national supply chain (since uranium is used across states), Congress can regulate it.

So the state tax is invalid because of the Commerce Clause and the Supremacy Clause. So option B or G.

Looking back, option G says "when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action." Plenary might not be the right term here, but the idea is that Congress's commerce power allows them to preempt state laws. So I think G is correct because it's about the Supremacy Clause making the state law invalid once Congress acts within its commerce power.

The question revolves around whether a state's tax on pitchblende extraction is valid after Congress enacted a law forbidding such taxes. The key issue is the interplay between federal authority under the Commerce Clause and state taxing power, as well as the Supremacy Clause.

The Constitution's Commerce Clause grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. While pitchblende is mined in only one state, the products derived from it—such as uranium and plutonium—are critical to national energy production and likely part of interstate commerce. Congress can regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce, and prohibiting the state tax on pitchblende extraction could be justified as protecting national economic interests.

The Supremacy Clause ensures that federal law preempts conflicting state laws when Congress acts within its constitutional authority. Here, Congress's prohibition on taxing pitchblende extraction, if grounded in the Commerce Clause, would override the state tax. The fact that the federal law affects only one state does not undermine Congress's authority, as the Commerce Clause applies even if the impact is localized, as long as it relates to interstate commerce.

Option G correctly identifies that when Congress exercises its authority under the Commerce Clause, the Supremacy Clause voids inconsistent state actions. While the term "plenary power" might imply exclusivity, the broader principle is that Congress's valid exercise of Commerce Clause authority preempts state laws. Therefore, the state tax on pitchblende extraction is invalid.
