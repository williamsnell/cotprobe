Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the access matrix approach to protection in computer systems. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Okay, the question is asking about the difficulty of the access matrix approach. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that the access matrix is a model used in computer security to manage access control. It's basically a matrix where one dimension represents subjects (like users or processes) and the other represents objects (like files or resources). Each cell in the matrix indicates the access rights that a subject has over an object, such as read, write, execute, etc.

Now, the question is about the difficulties or challenges this approach has. Let's look at each option.

Option A says it requires a lot of computational power. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. The matrix itself is more of a conceptual model. I don't recall it being computationally intensive. It's more about how it's implemented, maybe, but the model itself doesn't need massive processing power.

Option B claims it can't express complex protection requirements. Wait, I thought the access matrix is quite flexible because each cell can hold various rights. So maybe it can handle complex rules, making B incorrect.

Option C states that if the matrix is stored directly, it's large and clumsy. Oh right, because if you have many subjects and objects, the matrix would be huge. For instance, if there are thousands of users and thousands of files, the matrix would be a million entries or more. Storing this directly would take a lot of memory and could be hard to manage, so this might be a valid point.

Option D says the matrix can't be modified once created. That doesn't sound right. I think access rights can change, so the matrix should support modifications. So D is probably wrong.

Option E mentions it doesn't allow resource sharing between processes. Wait, the matrix does allow sharing because if a subject has access, multiple processes under that subject can access the resource. So E doesn't seem correct.

Option F points out there's no way to express who can change the access matrix itself. Oh, that's an interesting point. The access matrix defines access rights, but who has the right to modify the matrix itself? That's a meta-level access control issue. The matrix model itself doesn't include a mechanism for that. So the system would need another way to manage who can edit the matrix, which could be a limitation or difficulty.

Option G says it doesn't protect against external threats. Well, the access matrix is about internal access control, not about external threats like network attacks. But the question is about the difficulty of the approach itself, not its scope. So maybe G isn't the right answer here.

Option H claims there's no hierarchy of access rights. Wait, I think the access matrix is flat. It doesn't inherently support hierarchies, like allowing a manager to inherit rights from a subordinate. So expressing hierarchy might be a problem. But I'm not sure if that's the primary difficulty the question is pointing out.

Option I says deciding access is undecidable. That doesn't make much sense. Access is determined by looking up the matrix, so it's definitely decidable. So I is incorrect.

Option J says if the matrix isn't stored directly, it can cause failure. I'm not sure about this. If it's not stored directly, maybe it's computed on the fly, which could have trade-offs, but I don't think it's a primary issue. The main problem is more about the size when stored directly.

So, putting this together, the main difficulties seem to be either C or F or H. 

The question is about the specific difficulty. The access matrix approach doesn't inherently handle the modification of the matrix itself. For example, in the model, who can change the access rights (like who can modify the matrix entries) isn't part of the model. So the system using the matrix needs another mechanism to control who can edit it, which could be a limitation or a difficulty.

Alternatively, the size issue is another problem. If the matrix is stored directly, it can become very large, making it hard to manage. So options C and F are both possibilities.

Wait, looking back, the question asks about the difficulty that the access matrix approach has. I remember reading that one of the main issues is the size of the matrix. For example, a system with many subjects and objects would need a huge matrix, which is impractical to store and manage directly. So option C seems correct.

Another point is that in practice, access matrices are often sparse because each subject doesn't have access to every object. So storing the entire matrix isn't efficient, leading to the use of alternative methods like access control lists (ACLs) or capability lists, which only store non-empty entries. This supports option C as the correct answer.

So, considering all this, the correct answer is C: the matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage.

The access matrix approach is a widely used model for managing access control in computer systems. It organizes access rights in a matrix where subjects (e.g., users or processes) are represented on one axis and objects (e.g., files or resources) on the other. Each cell in the matrix specifies the access rights a subject has over an object. While this model is flexible and effective for defining access control, it presents certain challenges.

Among the options provided, the most significant difficulty is that the matrix, if stored directly, becomes large and cumbersome to manage. This is particularly true in systems with numerous subjects and objects, where the matrix can grow exponentially, requiring substantial memory and becoming unwieldy. For example, a system with thousands of subjects and objects would result in a matrix with millions of entries, making direct storage impractical. This limitation often leads to the use of alternative implementations, such as access control lists (ACLs) or capability lists, which store only non-empty entries and are more memory-efficient.

Other options, such as the inability to express who can modify the matrix (Option F) or the lack of hierarchy in access rights (Option H), are valid points but are not the primary difficulty associated with the access matrix approach. The size and manageability of the matrix when stored directly are the most prominent challenges.
