Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's asking.

The question states that the capital consumption in an economy is $500,000, and the GNP (Gross National Product) is $2,050,000. They're asking for the NNP, which I think stands for Net National Product.

Hmm, I remember that GNP includes the value of all final goods and services produced by the country, including depreciation. But wait, what's the exact relationship between GNP and NNP? Oh right, I think NNP is GNP minus depreciation or capital consumption. Oh right! So the formula should be NNP = GNP - Capital Consumption.

Wait, let me make sure I have that right. Capital consumption, also known as depreciation, represents the wear and tear on capital goods during production. So when calculating the net, we subtract that. So yes, NNP = GNP - Depreciation (or Capital Consumption).

So plugging in the numbers: GNP is $2,050,000 and capital consumption is $500,000. So NNP would be 2,050,000 minus 500,000.

Let me do the math: 2,050,000 minus 500,000 is 1,550,000. So the NNP should be $1,550,000.

Now looking at the options, option E is $1,550,000. So the correct answer should be E.

To determine the Net National Product (NNP), we use the formula:

**NNP = GNP - Capital Consumption**

Given:
- **GNP** = $2,050,000
- **Capital Consumption** = $500,000

Substituting the values:

**NNP = $2,050,000 - $500,000 = $1,550,000**

From the options provided, the correct answer is **E: $1,550,000**.
