Okay, so I've got this economics question here about the reserve ratio and how a withdrawal affects the money in circulation. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my monetary policy, but I'll think it out.

The question says the reserve ratio is 0.10, which is 10%. Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million from her checking account and keeps it as cash. I need to figure out how this affects the money in circulation.

Wait, so when someone withdraws cash from their checking account, what happens? Well, checking accounts are part of the money supply, specifically M1, which includes cash and demand deposits. So if she takes out $1 million in cash, that money is moving from her checking account (which is in the bank) to her physical possession.

But wait, how does this affect the overall money in circulation? Initially, I might think that taking cash out of the bank increases the money in circulation because she's holding more cash. But wait, the money was already in circulation when it was in her checking account. Or is it? Because when it's in the bank, it's part of the bank's reserves, right?

Oh wait, the reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that banks must hold in reserves. So if the bank has a reserve ratio of 10%, it means that for every $100 deposited, the bank must keep $10 in reserve and can lend out $90.

But in this case, the withdrawal is from Mommy's checking account. Let me think about the process. When she withdraws $1 million, the bank's reserves decrease by $1 million because they're giving her cash. But since the reserve ratio is 10%, the bank has to make sure it's holding enough reserves. So if the bank's reserves drop, does that affect the overall money supply?

Wait, the money in circulation... When she takes out $1 million, that cash is now outside the bank. But before, that $1 million was part of the bank's deposits (checking account), which the bank could use to make loans. Now, that $1 million is in her possession, so it's still part of the money supply, right? Or does moving it from the bank to her cash hoard change anything?

Wait, money in circulation typically refers to the currency held by the public, not the banks. So when she takes cash out, the money in circulation increases because she's holding it. But wait, the bank's reserves decrease by $1 million, which might affect their ability to lend. But does that have a multiplier effect?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up concepts here. The reserve ratio affects the money multiplier. The money multiplier is 1 divided by the reserve ratio. So with a 10% reserve ratio, the multiplier is 10. So when the bank gets an infusion of deposits, it can expand the money supply by a factor of 10.

But in this case, it's the opposite. The bank is losing $1 million in reserves because Mommy is withdrawing cash. So the bank's excess reserves are reduced, which would mean that the amount they can lend is reduced. This would lead to a decrease in the money supply, but how much?

Wait, but the question is about money in circulation, not the total money supply. So if Mommy takes out $1 million, that's $1 million more in circulation, right? So the money in circulation increases by $1 million. But wait, the options don't have that as an option. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: option B is Increases by $1 million. Option J is increases by $100,000. Hmm. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait another angle: when she withdraws $1 million, the bank's reserves drop by $1 million. Since the reserve ratio is 10%, the required reserves for the bank would be based on deposits. So if the bank's deposits decrease by $1 million (because she took the money out), then their required reserves decrease by 10% of that, which is $100,000. So the bank's excess reserves would decrease by $900,000 (since they had to give out $1 million, their reserves go down by $1 million, but their required reserves only went down by $100k, so excess is $900k less).

But how does that affect the money supply? The money multiplier effect would suggest that a change in reserves leads to a change in money supply by the multiplier factor. But wait, when reserves decrease, the money supply would decrease by (change in reserves) * money multiplier.

So the change in reserves is a decrease of $1 million. The money multiplier is 10. So the money supply would decrease by $10 million. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, that would mean the money supply decreases by $10 million. But the question is about money in circulation. So if the money supply decreases by $10 million, but Mommy has $1 million more in cash, then perhaps the overall effect is a decrease of $9 million?

Wait, that's confusing. Let me try to break it down more carefully.

When Mommy takes out $1 million in cash, the bank's reserves fall by $1 million. Because of the reserve requirement, the bank must have 10% of its deposits in reserves. So if deposits decrease by $1 million, required reserves decrease by $100,000. So the bank's excess reserves decrease by $900,000.

The money multiplier is 1/0.10 = 10. So the decrease in excess reserves would lead to a decrease in the money supply. The change in money supply would be the change in excess reserves times the multiplier. So $900,000 * 10 = $9 million decrease.

Wait, but the money in circulation is part of the money supply. But in this case, Mommy's action has two effects: she's holding more cash (which is part of money in circulation), and the bank's ability to lend is reduced, which would decrease the money supply by more than that.

So the total money supply would be the initial money plus the $1 million she took out, but then the bank's lending would decrease, leading to a contraction.

Wait, maybe I should model it step by step.

Initially, Mommy had $1 million in her checking account. That's part of M1. She withdraws it, so now she holds $1 million in cash. The bank's reserves (vault cash) decrease by $1 million. But the bank's required reserves were 10% of deposits, so when deposits fell by $1 million, required reserves fell by $100,000. So the bank now has excess reserves that are $900,000 less than before.

The bank can lend out its excess reserves. So a decrease of $900,000 in excess reserves would mean that the bank can't lend as much. Each dollar lent can create additional money through the multiplier effect. So the decrease in lending would lead to a decrease in the money supply.

The money multiplier is 10, so the change in excess reserves (-$900,000) times 10 gives a change in money supply of -$9,000,000.

But wait, the money supply includes both cash and deposits. So when Mommy takes out $1 million, that's a shift from deposits to cash. The total money supply would be the initial amount plus the $1 million taken out as cash, but then the bank's lending leads to a decrease.

Wait, no. The initial $1 million in deposits is part of the money supply. When she takes it out as cash, it's still part of the money supply. So the total M1 remains the same in that aspect. But the bank's ability to make loans is reduced, which reduces the broader money supply.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between M1 and the total money supply. Let me clarify.

M1 includes cash and checking deposits. So when Mommy takes $1 million from checking to cash, M1 remains the same because both are components of M1. But the bank's reserves go down by $1 million, which reduces their ability to lend, thus reducing the amount they can create through the lending multiplier. So the broader money supply (like M2) would decrease because the bank can't lend as much. But M1 remains the same.

But the question is about money in circulation. Money in circulation is cash held by the public, so when she takes out $1 million, that's an increase in circulation by $1 million.

But according to the options, the answer would be B: increases by $1 million. However, I'm seeing other possibilities here.

Wait, another angle: when she takes cash out, the bank's reserves are reduced by $1 million. The bank now has to maintain the reserve ratio. So if their deposits are $D, then required reserves are 0.10 * D. If their reserves (which include vault cash) are R, then R = 0.10 * D.

When she withdraws $1 million, deposits D decrease by $1 million. Therefore, required reserves decrease by 0.10 * $1 million = $100,000. So the bank's excess reserves (R - required reserves) decrease by $1 million (the reserves lost) minus the $100,000 reduction in required reserves. So excess reserves decrease by $900,000.

The money multiplier is 10, so the potential change in money supply is $900,000 * 10 = $9 million decrease.

But wait, the money supply includes both cash and deposits. So when Mommy takes out $1 million, that's a shift from deposits to cash. The total money supply (M1) doesn't change because both are part of M1. But the broader money supply (M2, M3) could be affected because the bank can't lend as much, so less lending leads to less deposit creation.

But the question is specifically about money in circulation. Money in circulation is the cash held by the public, so when she takes out $1 million, that's an increase of $1 million in circulation.

Wait, but the options don't have an increase of $1 million as the correct answer. Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B: Increases by $1 million.

But earlier, I thought that the money supply might decrease by $9 million because of the multiplier effect. But that's in the broader money supply, not M1.

Wait, the question asks about money in circulation, which is M0, just the cash. So when she takes out $1 million, that's an increase in M0 by $1 million. So the correct answer would be B.

But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. The bank's reserves go down by $1 million, which means they can't lend as much. That would lead to a contraction in the money supply elsewhere. But the money in circulation is just about the cash, so it's a separate measure.

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion is that when the bank's reserves decrease, they have less to lend, which reduces deposits, but the cash in circulation increases. So the net effect on money in circulation (cash) is an increase of $1 million, but the overall money supply (including deposits) would decrease by $9 million.

But the question specifically asks about money in circulation, which is just the cash. So the answer is B.

Wait, but another angle. The reserve ratio applies to deposits. So when deposits decrease, the bank's required reserves decrease. The bank may adjust by reducing their loans, which reduces deposits further. So the initial withdrawal causes a chain reaction.

But for money in circulation, it's just the cash. So the withdrawal increases cash in circulation by $1 million. So the answer is B.

But looking back at the options, that's option B. Hmm. But I'm a bit confused because some sources say that when you take cash out, it reduces the bank's ability to lend, which reduces the money supply. But that refers to the broader money supply, not just cash in circulation.

So the answer should be B: increases by $1 million.

The reserve ratio is 0.10 (10%), and Mommy Morebucks withdraws $1 million from her checking account, keeping it as cash. This action affects the money in circulation as follows:

1. **Withdrawal and Money in Circulation**: When Mommy withdraws $1 million in cash, this money moves from her checking account (a bank deposit) to her physical possession. Money in circulation refers to cash held by the public, so this withdrawal increases the money in circulation by $1 million.

2. **Impact on the Bank**: The bank's reserves decrease by $1 million due to the withdrawal. Since the reserve ratio is 10%, the bank's required reserves decrease by $100,000 (10% of $1 million). However, the bank's excess reserves decrease by $900,000 ($1 million reduction in reserves minus the $100,000 reduction in required reserves).

3. **Money Multiplier Effect**: The decrease in excess reserves could reduce the bank's ability to lend, potentially decreasing the broader money supply (e.g., M2 or M3) by $9 million (the $900,000 reduction in excess reserves multiplied by the money multiplier of 10). However, this effect is on the broader money supply, not the money in circulation.

4. **Focus on Money in Circulation**: The question specifically asks about money in circulation, which is cash held by the public. Since Mommy's withdrawal increases the cash held by the public by $1 million, the correct answer is an increase of $1 million.

Thus, the withdrawal increases the money in circulation by $1 million.

**Answer: B**
