Okay, so I've got this problem about designing a compression spring's wire diameter under fatigue loading. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step. 

The problem states that the fatigue loading has a minimum load of 145 lbs and a maximum of 295 lbs. We need to design the spring wire diameter considering a factor of safety of 1.4 against fatigue failure. The mean coil diameter is given as 0.95 inches, and the spring is made of hard-drawn wire.

Wait, I remember that for springs, especially under cyclic loading, fatigue is a big concern. Fatigue strength is crucial here. The factor of safety (FS) is applied to the fatigue strength to ensure the spring doesn't fail under the expected loads.

First, I think I need to calculate the stress amplitude. Stress in a spring is related to the force applied. The formula for shear stress in a spring is τ = (8FD)/(πd²), where F is the force, D is the mean diameter, and d is the wire diameter. But since this is a fatigue situation, I should consider the alternating stress.

In fatigue loading, the stress varies between a minimum and maximum value. So the stress amplitude (τm) would be (τmax - τmin)/2. But wait, since this is a mean stress situation, the Goodman or Soderberg equation might come into play for the fatigue strength.

Alternatively, I remember that for fatigue, the endurance limit is the key. For steels, the endurance limit is typically around 0.5 times the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), but that depends on factors like the material condition, surface finish, etc. Since it's hard-drawn wire, which is a type of cold-drawn steel, the UTS is probably higher than regular steel.

Wait, I think for hard-drawn steel wire, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) can be around 200,000 psi or more. But I'm not entirely sure. I think the formula for the fatigue strength (endurance limit) for wires might be given by Se = 0.5 * UTS. But I'm a bit hazy on the exact value.

Alternatively, I've heard that the fatigue strength for springs can be calculated using the formula:

Se = (FS * Fm) / (AG), 

where Fm is the mean force, and AG is a factor related to the stress. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up here.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Determine the mean and alternating forces.
2. Calculate the mean and alternating stresses.
3. Apply the Goodman line or another fatigue failure criterion to find the allowable stress.
4. Use the factor of safety to relate the allowable stress to the actual stress, then solve for the wire diameter.

So, first, the forces: F_min = 145 lbs, F_max = 295 lbs. The mean force Fm is (F_max + F_min)/2 = (295 + 145)/2 = 440/2 = 220 lbs. The alternating force Fa is (F_max - F_min)/2 = (150)/2 = 75 lbs. 

Wait wait, 295-145 is 150, so Fa is 75 lbs, right.

Now, the stress amplitude. The stress due to a force F is τ = (8FD)/(πd²). So for F = Fa, the alternating stress τa is (8 * Fa * D) / (π d²). Similarly, the mean stress τm is (8 * Fm * D) / (π d²).

But wait, in fatigue, the stress fluctuates between τ_min and τ_max. So the stress amplitude is (τ_max - τ_min)/2, and the mean stress is (τ_max + τ_min)/2. But I'm not sure if I'm applying this correctly here.

Alternatively, since the force varies from F_min to F_max, the stress varies from τ_min to τ_max. The stress amplitude would be (τ_max - τ_min)/2, which is the same as (τa) = (8 * Fa * D) / (π d²).

So, for the mean stress: τm = (8 * Fm * D) / (π d²).

Now, the factor of safety relates to the fatigue strength. The Goodman equation is: (τa)/(Se) + (τm)/(UTS) = 1/n, where n is the factor of safety. Wait, no, the Goodman equation is for relating mean and alternating stresses to the endurance limit and UTS.

Wait, the standard Goodman equation is:

τa / Se + τm / UTS = 1 / FS

Wait, no, maybe I remember it as (τa/Se) + (τm/UTS) = 1, but that might be without considering the factor of safety. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the allowable stress is determined by the endurance limit divided by the factor of safety. Because the factor of safety is applied to the endurance limit.

So, the maximum allowable stress amplitude would be Se / FS. Then, using that, I can find the required wire diameter.

Wait, let me think again. The factor of safety (FS) is applied to the fatigue strength. So, the allowable stress amplitude is Se divided by the factor of safety.

So, Se is the endurance limit. For hard-drawn steel wire, I believe Se is around 70,000 to 100,000 psi. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps Se = 0.5 * UTS. So if I can find the UTS for hard-drawn wire.

Wait, another approach. The AISC manual or machinery's handbook might have some standard values. For example, for music wire (which is a high carbon steel), the UTS is about 300,000 psi. But hard-drawn wire might have a lower UTS. Let me think, perhaps for hard-drawn wire, UTS is around 150,000 psi. So Se would be 0.5 * UTS = 75,000 psi.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident about that. Alternatively, perhaps for the endurance limit (Se) of hard-drawn steel, it's about 40,000 psi. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the fatigue strength of springs, which considers the factor of safety.

Another approach: The stress due to the variable loading must be within the endurance limit adjusted by the factor of safety.

So, the maximum stress (at F_max) would be τ_max = (8 * F_max * D) / (π d²).

The minimum stress is τ_min = (8 * F_min * D) / (π d²).

The mean stress is (τ_max + τ_min)/2, and the stress amplitude is (τ_max - τ_min)/2.

In fatigue, the Goodman line suggests that the combination of mean and alternating stress must lie below the line defined by the UTS and the endurance limit.

The Goodman equation is:

(τa / Se) + (τm / UTS) = 1.

But since we have a factor of safety (FS), perhaps we adjust the allowable stress.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the maximum allowable stress amplitude is Se / FS. Alternatively, the stress must satisfy τa ≤ Se / FS.

Wait, that might be an approach. So let's say τa is the alternating stress, and we set τa = Se / FS.

So, let's compute τa as (8 * Fa * D) / (π d²).

We need to find d such that τa = Se / FS.

But I need to find Se for the material. Let's assume that for hard-drawn steel wire, Se is, say, 40,000 psi. Wait, that seems low. Alternatively, perhaps Se is calculated based on the ultimate tensile strength.

Wait, another approach. The endurance limit (Se) for steels can be approximated as Se = 0.5 * UTS, provided that the UTS is below 200,000 psi. But if UTS is above 200,000 psi, Se is taken as 0.5 * 200,000 = 100,000 psi, according to the Goodman line approach.

So, first, we need the UTS of the material. Since it's hard-drawn wire, perhaps the UTS is around 180,000 psi. Then Se would be 0.5 * 180,000 = 90,000 psi.

But I'm really not certain about the exact UTS value. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for another way.

Wait, another formula I remember for the wire diameter under fatigue is:

d = [ (8 * FS * F_max * D) / (π * Se) ]^(1/3)

Wait, I'm not sure if that's correct, but let me try.

Wait, no, I think the formula is based on the stress equation.

So, τ = 8FD/(πd²).

Rearranged, d = sqrt(8FD/(πτ)).

But since we have alternating stress, we're considering the stress amplitude.

So, τa = 8 Fa D / (π d²).

We can solve for d: d = sqrt(8 Fa D / (π τa)).

Now, τa is the allowable stress amplitude, which would be Se / FS.

So, d = sqrt(8 Fa D / (π (Se/FS)) ).

We can plug in the numbers.

Given: Fa = 75 lbs (since Fa = (295-145)/2 = 75).

D = 0.95 inches.

FS = 1.4.

We need Se.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct value of Se for hard-drawn steel wire. Let me try to recall. 

In some references, for hard-drawn spring wire, the endurance limit (Se) is about 45,000 psi. Alternatively, perhaps it's higher. Alternatively, I might need to use the corrected Goodman equation considering that for torsional stresses, the endurance limit is adjusted.

Wait, another thought. The Goodman equation can be written as:

τa = Se (1 - τm / UTS )

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the mean stress affects the allowable alternating stress.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the Soderberg equation, which is:

τa / Se + τm / (0.5 UTS) = 1 / FS

Wait, no, I'm getting more confused now.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with the assumption that Se is 45,000 psi. Let's try that.

So Se = 45,000 psi.

τa = Se / FS = 45000 / 1.4 ≈ 32143 psi.

Now, τa is given by 8 Fa D / (π d²) = 32143.

So, 8 * 75 lbs * 0.95 in / (π d²) = 32143 psi.

Wait, but wait, the units. Since pounds are in lbf, and inches are in inches, when we calculate stress in psi, we need to ensure that the units are compatible.

Wait, the formula for stress is τ = 8FD/(πd²).

F is force in lbf, D is diameter in inches, so F*D is in lbf*in, and d is in inches, so d² is in². So the units would be (lbf * in) / in² = lbf/in, which is psi.

So, 8 * 75 * 0.95 / (π d²) = 32143.

Let me compute the numerator: 8 *75 = 600; 600 *0.95 = 570.

So, 570 / (π d²) = 32143.

Solving for d²: d² = 570 / (π * 32143).

Calculate the denominator: π * 32143 ≈ 3.1416 * 32143 ≈ let's compute 3*32143=96429, 0.1416*32143≈ 4553. So total ≈ 96429 + 4553 ≈ 100,982.

So, d² ≈ 570 / 100982 ≈ 0.005645 in².

Taking square root: d ≈ sqrt(0.005645) ≈ 0.0751 inches. Wait, that's about 0.075 inches. But looking at the options, the closest is option E: 0.18 in, which is 0.18. Hmm, that's way off. So perhaps my assumption of Se is wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the Se value. Let me think again. If I took Se as higher, say 70,000 psi, then τa = 70,000 / 1.4 = 50,000 psi.

So, let's try that.

τa = 50,000 = 8 *75 *0.95 / (π d²).

So, 8*75=600, 600 *0.95=570.

So, 570/(π d²)=50,000.

d² = 570 / (π * 50000) ≈ 570 / (157,080) ≈ 0.003627 in².

d ≈ sqrt(0.003627) ≈ 0.0602 in. That's even smaller, which doesn't match any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I have the formula wrong. Maybe I should consider the mean stress as well, not just the alternating stress.

Let me try to approach this with the Goodman equation. The Goodman equation is:

τa / Se + τm / UTS = 1.

We want to ensure that this is satisfied with a factor of safety. So perhaps the equation becomes τa / (Se/FS) + τm / (UTS/FS) = 1.

Wait, that could make sense, as each term is divided by the adjusted strength.

So, τa = (8 Fa D)/(π d²).

τm = (8 Fm D)/(π d²).

So, plugging into the Goodman equation with FS:

(8 Fa D)/(π d² (Se / FS)) + (8 Fm D)/(π d² (UTS / FS)) ) = 1.

Simplify:

[8 Fa D FS ] / [ π d² Se ] + [8 Fm D FS ] / [ π d² UTS ] = 1.

Factor out [8 D FS ] / [ π d² ]:

[8 D FS / (π d²)] * [ Fa / Se + Fm / UTS ] = 1.

Wait, perhaps that's too complicated. Maybe I should find UTS for the material.

Wait, if Se = 0.5 UTS, then UTS = 2 Se.

So, substituting that into the equation, we get:

τa / Se + τm / (2 Se) = 1.

Which simplifies to:

τa + τm/2 = Se.

So, that's another approach.

So, τa = 8 Fa D / (π d²).

τm = 8 Fm D / (π d²).

So, τa + τm/2 = Se.

Putting them together:

(8 Fa D)/(π d²) + (8 Fm D)/(2 π d²) ) = Se.

Simplify:

(8 Fa D)/(π d²) + (4 Fm D)/(π d²) ) = Se.

Factor out 8 D/(π d²):

[8 Fa + 4 Fm ] D / (π d²) ) = Se.

So, 8 Fa +4 Fm = 8*75 +4*220 = 600 + 880 = 1480.

So, 1480 D / (π d²) ) = Se.

So, 1480 * 0.95 / (π d²) = Se.

Which is 1480 *0.95 = 1406.

So, 1406 / (π d²) = Se.

We need to find Se. Wait, but we don't know Se yet. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use Se = 0.5 UTS, and find UTS from some standard for hard-drawn wire.

Wait, I think hard-drawn steel wire has a UTS around 180,000 psi, so Se would be 90,000 psi.

So, 1406 / (π d²) = 90,000.

Solving for d²: d² = 1406 / (π * 90,000) ≈ 1406 / (282,743) ≈ 0.004977 in².

d ≈ sqrt(0.004977) ≈ 0.0705 inches. Again, that's about 0.07 inches, but none of the options are that low. The smallest option is E at 0.18, which is much larger.

Wait, so perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the formula I'm using isn't correct, or I'm miscalculating somewhere.

Another thought: Perhaps the mean coil diameter D is given as 0.95 inches, so the wire diameter d is subtracted from D to get the inside diameter. No, wait, mean coil diameter is typically the average of the inside and outside diameters, but in the formula for stress, it's the mean diameter that's used, so D is given as 0.95 in. So I think I'm correct in using D = 0.95.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. I've heard that for springs, the stress can also be expressed as τ = 8 F D / (π d²), but perhaps that's for a specific condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the wire diameter d and the mean diameter D. Let me confirm: yes, the formula is correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider the ultimate tensile strength and the endurance limit differently. Let me try looking for another approach.

Wait, perhaps using the fatigue strength formula for springs, which is:

d = ( (8 * F_max * D) / (π * S_e) )^(1/3)

But that would be for static loading, not considering fatigue. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, considering the stress range. The stress range Δτ is τ_max - τ_min.

Δτ = (8 F_max D)/(π d²) - (8 F_min D)/(π d²) = 8 (F_max - F_min) D / (π d²) = 8 Fa *2 D / (π d²) because Fa is (F_max - F_min)/2.

Wait, no, Fa is (F_max - F_min)/2, so (F_max - F_min) = 2 Fa. Thus, Δτ = 8 * 2 Fa D/(π d²) = 16 Fa D/(π d²).

So, Δτ = 16 Fa D/(π d²).

In fatigue, the stress range is related to the number of cycles, but in this case, we're looking for the stress range that the spring can endure without failing,
