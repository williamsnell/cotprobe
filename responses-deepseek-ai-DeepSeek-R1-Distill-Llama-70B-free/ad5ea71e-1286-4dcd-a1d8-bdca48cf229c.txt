Okay, so I've got this problem about a ladder sliding down a wall. Hmm, I remember these are related rates problems from calculus. Let me try to think through it step by step.

So the ladder is 9 meters long. It's leaning against a vertical wall on level ground. The bottom is being moved away from the wall at 2 meters per second. I need to find how fast the top is sliding down when it's 3 meters above the ground.

Alright, let's visualize this. The ladder, the wall, and the ground form a right triangle. The ladder is the hypotenuse with length 9m. Let's denote the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall as x, and the height of the top of the ladder on the wall as y.

So, by the Pythagorean theorem, x² + y² = 9², which is 81.

Now, we know the bottom is moving away at dx/dt = 2 m/s. We need to find dy/dt when y = 3 m.

Since we're dealing with related rates, I should differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time t.

Differentiating x² + y² = 81:

2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0.

Wait, yeah, because the derivative of 81 is zero.

So, simplifying, 2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0. We can divide both sides by 2:

x dx/dt + y dy/dt = 0.

We're looking for dy/dt, so let's solve for that.

x dx/dt + y dy/dt = 0 → y dy/dt = -x dx/dt → dy/dt = -(x/y) dx/dt.

Okay, so dy/dt is negative because the top is moving downward, which makes sense.

Now, we need to find x when y is 3m. Because the problem specifies the top is 3m above ground at that moment.

So, using the Pythagorean theorem again with y=3:

x² + (3)^2 = 81 → x² = 81 - 9 = 72 → x = sqrt(72) → sqrt(36*2) → 6*sqrt(2) meters.

So x is 6√2 m when y is 3 m.

Now plug the known values into the expression for dy/dt:

dy/dt = -(x/y) dx/dt = -(6√2 / 3) * 2.

Simplify that:

6√2 divided by 3 is 2√2. So 2√2 * 2 is 4√2. But wait, there's a negative sign, so dy/dt is -4√2 m/s.

But the question asks for how fast the top end is sliding downward. Since it's moving downward, the rate is positive, but the negative just indicates direction. So the speed is 4√2 m/s.

Looking at the options, option C is 4*sqrt(2). So I think that's the answer.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the ladder, wall, and ground form a right triangle, where the ladder is the hypotenuse with a length of 9 meters. Let \( x \) represent the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall, and \( y \) represent the height of the top of the ladder on the wall. Using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
x^2 + y^2 = 81
\]

We are given that the bottom of the ladder is moving away from the wall at a constant rate of \( \frac{dx}{dt} = 2 \, \text{m/s} \), and we need to find how fast the top of the ladder is sliding downward (\( \frac{dy}{dt} \)) when \( y = 3 \, \text{m} \).

First, differentiate the Pythagorean equation with respect to time \( t \):

\[
2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \frac{dy}{dt} = 0
\]

Simplify by dividing through by 2:

\[
x \frac{dx}{dt} + y \frac{dy}{dt} = 0
\]

Solve for \( \frac{dy}{dt} \):

\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = -\frac{x}{y} \frac{dx}{dt}
\]

Next, determine \( x \) when \( y = 3 \, \text{m} \) using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
x^2 + 3^2 = 81 \implies x^2 = 72 \implies x = \sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2} \, \text{m}
\]

Substitute \( x = 6\sqrt{2} \), \( y = 3 \), and \( \frac{dx}{dt} = 2 \) into the expression for \( \frac{dy}{dt} \):

\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = -\frac{6\sqrt{2}}{3} \cdot 2 = -4\sqrt{2} \, \text{m/s}
\]

The negative sign indicates that the top of the ladder is moving downward. Since the problem asks for the speed (magnitude), the answer is \( 4\sqrt{2} \, \text{m/s} \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: \( 4\sqrt{2} \)**
