Okay, I need to solve this problem about radiation dose and time. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. So the question is asking how long it would take for a person to receive a maximum weekly dose of 2.0 rem to their hands and forearms. 

First, I remember that dose in rem is calculated using the formula: Dose (rem) = Dose rate (rad/h) × Time (h). Wait, but I think I have to convert the units correctly because the time might be in minutes.

So, the first thing I need is the dose rate. The problem gives me the source strength as 15 millicuries. Oh right, millicuries is a unit of radioactivity. I remember that the activity (A) is related to the dose rate through the formula involving gamma rays. 

The source emits gamma rays with 3.0 MeV energy. I think each gamma photon's energy is important here. So, I need to find the exposure rate from the source. There's a formula for exposure rate, which is often given in roentgens per hour (R/h), but I might need to convert that to rads or rems.

Wait, the units can get a bit tricky. Let me think: 1 rad is equal to 0.001 joules per kilogram, and 1 rem is equal to 0.01 sieverts, which relates to the biological effect. But for gamma rays, I think the roentgen is a unit that's exposure, not dose. Oh right, 1 roentgen (R) is approximately 0.00877 rads in air when considering gamma rays, but wait, the problem says to assume no radiation is absorbed by the air, so maybe that part doesn't matter here.

Wait, no. The roentgen is about exposure in air, but in this problem, the radiation is not absorbed by the air, so perhaps the entire flux reaches the person. Hmm, but how does that affect the calculations? Maybe I can proceed without worrying about air absorption because it's given.

So, going back: the formula I need is the exposure rate from a gamma source. The exposure rate (in R/h) at a certain distance can be calculated using the point source formula. The formula is:

Exposure rate (R/h) = (Activity (Ci) × Gamma ray constant (R·h²/(Ci·cm²)) × Energy factor) / (distance (cm))²

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, I recall that the exposure rate constant (Γ) for gamma rays is given in R·h²/(Ci·cm²) for a particular energy. For example, for a 1 MeV gamma, the Γ is about 0.608 R·h²/(Ci·cm²). But wait, the source here is emitting 3.0 MeV gammas, so does that change the Γ? Or is each photon's energy considered individually?

Wait, no, the gamma constant is specific to the energy. For example, for 1 MeV, it's about 0.608, for 2 MeV, it's around 0.462, but wait, I might be mixing up numbers. Alternatively, I think that the exposure rate can be calculated using the formula:

Exposure rate (R/h) = (A * Γ * E) / d²

Where:
A is activity in Ci,
Γ is the exposure rate constant (R·h²/(Ci·cm²·photon)),
E is energy per photon in MeV,
d is distance in cm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check: Another approach is to use the formula for dose rate:

Dose rate (rad/h) = (A * Γ * E) / d²

But wait, I think I need to find the correct gamma constant. Alternatively, the general formula for exposure rate from a gamma source is:

Exposure rate (R/h) = (A * Γ * E) / d²

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

Exposure rate (R/h) = (A × Γ) / d²

But I'm getting stuck because I'm not entirely sure about the correct formula. Let me think again. Maybe I should use the formula that involves the activity and the energy per photon.

Another approach: The activity A is 15 millicuries, which is 15 mCi. To convert that to Ci, it's 0.015 Ci. The distance is 15 cm, so d² is 225 cm².

I think the formula for the exposure rate in R/h is:

Exposure rate = (A × Γ × E) / d²

Where Γ is the exposure rate constant for the specific gamma energy. For 1 MeV, Γ is about 0.608 R·h²/(Ci·cm²·MeV). Wait, no, I think Γ is specific per energy, so for 1 MeV, Γ is 0.608 R·h²/(Ci·cm²), and for other energies, it's different. So for a 3.0 MeV gamma, what's the Γ? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should look for a table or a way to calculate it.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula involving the photon energy and the number of photons emitted per second. Let me think about it in terms of flux.

The number of photons emitted per second (N) is given by the activity A, which is the number of decays per second. A is 15 mCi = 0.015 Ci. Since 1 Ci is 3.7e10 decays per second, so A = 0.015 × 3.7e10 = 5.55e9 decays/s.

Assuming each decay emits one gamma photon, which is the case for this problem, then N = 5.55e9 photons/s.

The energy per photon E is 3.0 MeV. To convert that to ergs, since 1 eV = 1.602e-12 ergs, 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so E = 3.0 MeV = 3.0e6 eV × 1.602e-12 erg/eV = 4.806e-6 ergs per photon.

Now, the flux at distance d is given by the number of photons per cm² per second. The flux Φ = N / (4πd²).

But wait, since the area is a sphere of radius d, the area is 4πd² cm², so Φ = N / (4πd²) photons/cm²/s.

Then, the energy deposition rate (dose rate) would be Φ × E × conversion factors.

But wait, I'm trying to find the exposure in R/h. So, perhaps I should relate the energy flux to the exposure rate.

Alternatively, the exposure X is defined as the charge produced per unit mass of air. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should find the exposure rate in R/h using the flux and energy.

Wait, another approach: Use the formula for the exposure rate (X) in R/h:

X = (A * Γ) / d²

Where Γ is the exposure rate constant in R·h²/(Ci·cm²) per photon, but I think Γ already accounts for the energy, so for a 3 MeV photon, what is Γ?

Wait, I think I'm confusing the gamma constant. Let me recall: for a monoenergetic source of gamma rays with energy E (MeV), the gamma constant Γ is approximately 0.2E + 0.825, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Γ for Co-60 (1.25 MeV) is about 0.34 R·h²/(Ci·cm²). For Cs-137 (0.662 MeV), it's about 0.319 R·h²/(Ci·cm²). So perhaps for 3.0 MeV, it's higher. Maybe Γ is around 0.608 for 1 MeV, as I thought earlier, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I can use the formula Γ = 0.5 * E, but that might not be accurate.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find the correct gamma constant for a 3 MeV photon. From what I remember, for a 1 MeV gamma, the gamma constant Γ is approximately 0.608 R·h²/(Ci·cm²). So for 3 MeV, is it three times that? No, because gamma constant isn't linear with energy. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a table, but since I can't do that, I'll have to make an assumption. Let's say for 3 MeV, Γ is about 1.2 R·h²/(Ci·cm²). Wait, that might not be correct, but let me proceed for now.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula:

Exposure rate (R/h) = (A * Γ * E) / d²

Wait, but I'm not sure if it's E in MeV, and what units Γ is in. Alternatively, the formula I think is:

Exposure rate (R/h) = (A (Ci) × Γ (R·h²/(Ci·cm²)) ) / (d (cm))²

So Γ should be in R·h²/(Ci·cm²). So for a particular gamma energy, Γ is a known constant. 

From my notes, for example, for Co-60 (gamma energy about 1.25 MeV), Γ is approximately 0.34 R·h²/(Ci·cm²). For Cs-137 (0.662 MeV), Γ is about 0.319.

So for 3.0 MeV, I'm not sure, but maybe it's higher. Let me try to find a correlation. I think the exposure rate constant increases with energy, but perhaps not linearly. Alternatively, maybe the value for 3 MeV is around 0.6 or higher. Let me think: I've heard that for higher energy gammas, the exposure rate constant is higher because each photon carries more energy. So perhaps for 3 MeV, Γ is about 0.608 * 3 = 1.824? But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's 0.608 R·h²/(Ci·cm²) per MeV, so 3 MeV would be 0.608 * 3 = 1.824 R·h²/(Ci·cm²). Wait, that would make sense if Γ scales with the photon energy.

But I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Maybe I should look up the formula another way. Alternatively, perhaps the exposure rate can be calculated using the formula:

X = (A * N_A * E_photon) / (d² * e * m_air)

Wait, that's getting more complicated. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the dose rate using the formula:

Dose rate (rad/h) = (A (Ci) × 0.5 × Γ (R·h²/(Ci·cm²)) × E (MeV)) / d² (cm²)

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try to find a better approach.

Wait, I found a formula elsewhere: The exposure rate in R/h is given by X = (A × Γ) / (d²), where Γ is in R·h²/(Ci·cm²). So for a 3 MeV photon, what's Γ?

Looking up a table, I find that for:

- 0.1 MeV: Γ ≈ 0.06
- 0.5 MeV: Γ ≈ 0.2
- 1.0 MeV: Γ ≈ 0.608
- 2.0 MeV: Γ ≈ 0.46
- 3.0 MeV: Γ ≈ 0.56

Wait, I'm not sure if that's accurate, but let's proceed with Γ = 0.608 for 1 MeV. But the problem is for 3 MeV. Alternatively, perhaps Γ is about 0.5 for 3 MeV. Hmm, this is getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the absorbed dose rate in air:

Dose rate (rad/h) = (A × 0.5 × E (MeV) × 5.93e-5) / d²

Wait, I'm getting this from a formula I found once. Let me see:

The formula is D = (A × 0.5 × E × 5.93e-5) / (d²), where D is in rads per hour, A is in Ci, E in MeV, d in cm.

Wait, let me check the units. 0.5 is perhaps a unit conversion factor. Let me see: 5.93e-5 is in units that would convert everything into rads per hour.

So, let me apply this formula.

Given:
A = 0.015 Ci (since 15 mCi = 0.015 Ci)
E = 3.0 MeV
d = 15 cm

Plug into the formula:

Dose rate (rad/h) = (0.015 Ci) × 0.5 × 3.0 MeV × 5.93e-5 / (15 cm)²

Let me compute this step by step.

First, calculate the numerator:

0.015 * 0.5 = 0.0075
0.0075 * 3.0 = 0.0225
0.0225 * 5.93e-5 = Let's compute that.

5.93e-5 is 0.0000593.

So 0.0225 * 0.0000593 = 0.000001332.

Wait, let me compute:

0.0225 * 0.0000593:

Multiply 225e-4 * 59.3e-6 = (225 * 59.3) * 1e-10.

225 * 59.3 = let's compute:

200 * 59.3 = 11,860
25 *59.3=1,482.5
Total: 11,860 + 1,482.5 = 13,342.5

So 13,342.5e-10 = 1.33425e-6.

So numerator is 1.33425e-6.

Denominator is (15 cm)^2 = 225 cm².

So Dose rate = 1.33425e-6 / 225 ≈ 5.927e-9 rad/h.

Wait, that seems really low. That can't be right. Because 5.927e-9 rad/h is a very small dose rate. That would mean it would take an extremely long time to accumulate 2.0 rem, which is 200 rad (since 1 rem = 100 rad? Wait no, wait. Wait, 1 rem is 0.001 rad? No, wait: 1 rad is 100 ergs per gram, and 1 rem is equal to 0.01 sieverts, which for gamma rays is 1 rem = 0.01 Sv. Wait, but I'm getting confused between rads and rems.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: 1 rad = 0.01 J/kg. 1 rem = 0.01 Sv. For gamma rays, the radiation weighting factor is 1, so 1 Sv = 1 J/kg. Therefore, 1 rem = 0.01 Sv = 0.01 J/kg, which is 0.01 rad.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1 Sv is 100 rem. Because 1 Sv = 100 rem. So, 1 rem = 0.01 Sv. And since 1 Sv is 1 J/kg, 1 rem is 0.01 J/kg, which is 0.01 rad. Because 1 rad is 0.01 J/kg (since 1 rad = 0.01 J/kg). Wait, no, 1 rad is 0.01 J/kg? Wait, no, 1 rad is 0.01 J/kg. Yes, because 1 Gy is 1 J/kg, and 1 Gy = 100 rad. So 1 rad = 0.01 J/kg.

So, 1 rem is 0.01 Sv, which for gamma rays is 0.01 Sv * 1 (since gamma's Q is 1) = 0.01 Sv, which is 0.01 J/kg, which is 1 rad.

Wait, no: Wait, 1 Sv = 100 rem. So, 1 rem = 0.01 Sv. And 1 Sv is 1 J/kg. So, 1 rem = 0.01 J/kg, which is 1 rad.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 1 rad is 0.01 J/kg, yes. So 1 rem is 0.01 J/kg × (Q), where Q is the quality factor. For gamma rays, Q=1, so 1 rem = 0.01 J/kg = 1 rad. So, 1 rem = 1 rad.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. 

Actually, 1 rad is 0.01 J/kg. 1 rem is 0.01 Sv. Since 1 Sv is 1 J/kg, then 1 rem is 0.01 J/kg, which is exactly 1 rad. So yes, 1 rem = 1 rad. So in this problem, the dose is 2.0 rem = 2.0 rads.

But wait, the problem says the maximum weekly dose is 2.0 rem. So the required dose D is 2.0 rem, which is 2.0 rads.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the dose rate is 5.927e-9 rad/h, which is 5.927e-9 rads per hour. That seems way too low. So to get 2.0 rads, time = D / rate = 2.0 / (5.927e-9) hours. That would be a huge number, which doesn't make sense given the answer options are in the range of tens of minutes.

I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.

The formula I used earlier: Dose rate (rad/h) = (A × 0.5 × E × 5.93e-5) / d².

Wait, maybe the formula is incorrect. Let me check the units. The 5.93e-5 must have units that, when multiplied by Ci, MeV, etc., give rad/h.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Dose rate (rad/h) = (A × 0.5 × E × 5.93e-5) / (d²)

Wait, but 5.93e-5 has units of (rad·h)/(Ci·MeV·cm²). Let me
