Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about differential diagnosis between bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. Hmm, I remember that both are eating disorders but have some key differences.

The question is asking about one of the key features that distinguish them. Let me think about the characteristics of each disorder.

Anorexia nervosa is primarily marked by self-starvation, leading to a significantly low body weight. People with anorexia have a fear of gaining weight and often restrict their food intake. They might also exercise excessively. Sometimes, they might purge, but that's not the main feature.

Bulimia nervosa, on the other hand, is characterized by episodes of binge eating followed by purging or other compensatory behaviors. People with bulimia usually maintain a normal or near-normal weight because they rid their bodies of the consumed calories quickly.

So the question is about the key differential feature. Let's look at the options:

Option A: Use of laxatives. Both might use laxatives as a purge method, so that's not unique.

Option B: Purging. Both can purge, but in different contexts. Anorexia might have purging subtype, while bulimia always involves purging after binging.

Option C: Fear of gaining weight. Both have this fear, so that's not distinguishing.

Option D: Bingeing. That's the hallmark of bulimia. Anorexia typically doesn't involve bingeing; they restrict instead.

Option E: Excessive exercise. Both may do this, so not unique.

Option F: All of the above. No, because some options are similar.

Option G: Maintaining normal body weight. That's more bulimia, since anorexia leads to low weight.

Option H: Overeating in short periods. That's bingeing, which is D.

Option I: None of the above. Maybe not, since D and G are possible.

Option J: Self-imposed starvation. That's more anorexia.

So the key feature between them is that bulimia involves bingeing (D) and typically normal weight (G), while anorexia involves self-starvation (J) and low weight.

But the question is about the differential diagnosis. So one of the key features is whether the person binges. Because anorexia doesn't involve regular bingeing episodes, whereas bulimia does. So the answer would be D: Bingeing.

Alternatively, another point is body weightâ€”G: Maintaining a normal weight is a key feature of bulimia, whereas anorexia leads to being underweight. So G could also be a differentiator.

Wait, the question is which is a key feature. Both could be distinguishing factors. But the options list each as separate choices.

Looking back, the question is which is one of the key features. So either D or G could be correct.

Wait, the options are presented as A through J, so perhaps the answer is G and D. But the options are single letters. The question asks for one key feature.

The most distinguishing feature is probably the presence of binge eating in bulimia. Because while both can purge and fear weight gain, the bingeing is unique to bulimia. So D: Bingeing would be the key feature.

Alternatively, maintaining a normal body weight (G) is also a key point. Because in anorexia, they're underweight, whereas bulimia patients are usually normal weight or even overweight sometimes.

So perhaps the key differential is G: Maintaining a normal body weight.

Wait, but the options are individual. Let's think about what the DSM says. Anorexia is characterized by restriction leading to significantly low weight, intense fear of gaining weight, and disturbance in self-perceived weight. Bulimia involves recurrent episodes of binge eating, inappropriate compensatory behaviors (like purging), and self-evaluation unduly influenced by body shape/weight.

So the key difference would be the presence of binge eating (bingeing) in bulimia and the low body weight in anorexia. So for differential diagnosis, one key feature is whether the person has episodes of bingeing.

Looking back at the options, D is Bingeing. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but the options list is A-J, and the options are:

A: Use of laxatives

B: Purging

C: Fear of gaining weight

D: Bingeing

E: Excessive exercise

F: All of the above

G: Maintaining a normal body weight

H: Overeating in short periods (which is similar to D, bingeing)

I: None of the above

J: Self-imposed starvation

So in the options, D and H seem similar. H is overeating in short periods, which is essentially bingeing.

But D is Bingeing, H is overeating. I think D is more precise.

So the key feature is whether the person binges. So the answer is D.

Alternatively, the key feature could be their weight. So G: Maintaining a normal body weight is a key feature differentiating bulimia from anorexia.

Wait, the question is about the key feature for differential diagnosis. Both could be distinguishing factors, but perhaps the primary one is the presence of bingeing in bulimia.

So I'm going to go with D: Bingeing as the key feature.

The key feature for making a differential diagnosis between bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa is the presence of bingeing, which is a hallmark of bulimia nervosa. While anorexia nervosa is characterized by self-imposed starvation and significant low body weight, bulimia nervosa involves recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors like purging. Although maintaining a normal body weight (option G) is also a distinguishing factor, the presence of bingeing (option D) is more specific to bulimia nervosa and serves as a primary differentiator.

Answer: D
