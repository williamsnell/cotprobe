Question:

On Thursday, March 7, an owner's home was destroyed by fire. The owner's house was insured against such fire loss by an insurance company. According to the policy contract, the insured was required to notify the insurance company within 10 days following any loss due to fire or other catastrophe. The owner sued the insurance company to recover $750,000, which was the face amount that his home was insured for. The insurance company admitted that the owner's house was insured for that amount, though the company denied liability because it claimed that it had not received notice of the fire within the 10-day period as required by the policy. At trial, the owner calls his bookkeeper to testify. The bookkeeper proposes to testify that on March 11, the owner handed her an envelope and told her it contained a notice form for the insurance company, and that she mailed the envelope on his behalf. If the bookkeeper intends to establish that the envelope that the owner handed her contained the notice of fire loss, her proposed testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, because the owner's statement to her is non-hearsay.
B: inadmissible, as the bookkeeper's testimony is considered second-hand information.
C: admissible, because a letter properly mailed is presumed received in due course.
D: inadmissible, because it is the responsibility of the owner, not the bookkeeper, to ensure the insurance company received the notice.
E: inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is not the best evidence.
F: admissible, as the bookkeeper's testimony provides proof of the owner's attempt to notify the insurance company.
G: inadmissible, because the owner's statement to the bookkeeper is hearsay not within any exception.
H: inadmissible, because the bookkeeper cannot confirm the contents of the envelope.
I: admissible, because the owner's statement is considered a verbal act.
J: admissible, because the bookkeeper is a credible witness.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let's take it step by step. The situation is about an insurance claim where the owner's house was destroyed by fire. The insurance company is denying the claim because they say they didn't get the notice within 10 days as required by the policy. The owner is suing to recover the $750,000.

The owner called his bookkeeper to testify. She's going to say that on March 11, the owner gave her an envelope and told her it contained a notice form for the insurance company. Then she mailed it for him. The question is whether her testimony about what the owner said is admissible.

Hmm, I remember that hearsay is a big issue here. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So the owner told the bookkeeper that the envelope had the notice. If the bookkeeper is testifying about that statement, is that hearsay? It seems like it might be because the statement is being used to prove that the envelope indeed contained the notice.

Wait, but there's an exception to hearsay called the "verbal act" doctrine. Sometimes, words are used not just to communicate information but to perform an action. Like, if someone says, "I appoint you as my agent," those words are a verbal act and not hearsay. Or in this case, the owner telling the bookkeeper that the envelope contains the notice might be a verbal act because it's part of the process of mailing the notice.

Another angle: the owner's statement is about the contents of the envelope. The bookkeeper can't confirm what was inside, but she's testifying about what the owner said. So the content of the envelope is what's crucial here. If the owner said it had the notice, then that's being used to prove that the envelope did have it, which would make it hearsay.

Wait, but if the purpose is to show that the owner intended to send the notice, maybe it's not hearsay. Like, the owner's statement is being used to show that he took the action of mailing the notice, not necessarily the truth of the contents. Or is it? Because the statement's truth is that the envelope had the notice, which is what's being offered to prove.

Alternatively, maybe it's admissible under the hearsay exception for statements of a party opponent. The owner is the party here, so his statement to the bookkeeper would be an admission by a party opponent. That's an exception under FRE 801(d)(2). So if the bookkeeper is testifying about the owner's statement, it's an admission and not hearsay.

Wait, but the owner is the plaintiff, so he's a party. His statement to the bookkeeper would be an admission. So that makes the statement admissible as non-hearsay.

Wait, but does the owner's statement about the envelope's contents count as an admission? Because the owner is the one making the statement, and it's being offered against his own interest? Or is it being offered in his own case? He's the plaintiff, so his own statement would be an admission by a party opponent. So it's not hearsay.

Wait, but the bookkeeper is testifying about what the owner said. So the owner's out-of-court statement is being offered for the truth of the matter (that the envelope contained the notice). But as an admission, it's exempt from hearsay. So that would make the testimony admissible.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the mailing. The bookkeeper is testifying that she mailed the envelope on March 11. But the issue is whether the envelope contained the notice. So the owner's statement is to prove that it did, which is hearsay unless an exception applies.

But wait, the owner is the plaintiff, and the statement is part of his own action. So the statement would be an admission. So under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), it's not hearsay.

So looking at the options, option A says it's admissible because the owner's statement is non-hearsay. That would make sense if it's an admission. Option G says it's inadmissible as hearsay with no exception. But if it's an admission, G would be wrong.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Could it be that the owner's statement is not offered for the truth but just to show that he gave the envelope to the bookkeeper? But I don't think that's the case. The purpose is to show that the envelope had the notice, which is the truth of the matter.

Wait, but the question is whether the owner's statement is hearsay. If the bookkeeper is testifying about what the owner said, and the purpose is to prove that the envelope had the notice, then it's hearsay. Unless an exception applies.

So is the owner's statement an admission? I think it is. Because the owner is a party, and he's making a statement that's being offered against the insurance company. So it's an opposing party's statement, making it admissible under 801(d)(2).

So the correct answer would be A: admissible, because the owner's statement is non-hearsay as an admission.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Another angle: the bookkeeper's testimony about mailing the envelope is relevant to prove that the notice was sent. But whether the owner actually put the notice in the envelope is another matter. The owner's statement that it was a notice is hearsay unless it's an admission.

So yes, it's an admission, so it's admissible. So option A is correct.

Alternatively, another option might be F: admissible as proof of the owner's attempt to notify. But that's more about the owner's intent to send the notice, not about the contents. But the statement is about the contents, so that's more about the truth of the matter.

So I think the correct answer is A.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the bookkeeper's testimony regarding the owner's statement that the envelope contained a notice of fire loss. The key issue is whether this statement constitutes hearsay and, if so, whether it falls under any exception.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the owner's statement to the bookkeeper about the envelope's contents is being used to prove that the envelope contained the notice, which appears to be hearsay. However, under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(2)(A), statements made by a party opponent (in this case, the owner, as the plaintiff) are not considered hearsay. The owner's statement to the bookkeeper qualifies as an admission by a party opponent, making it admissible.

Other options were considered but found less applicable. For example, the "verbal act" doctrine might apply if the statement was part of an action (e.g., mailing the notice), but the primary purpose here is to prove the envelope's contents, making the admission exception more relevant. Additionally, the bookkeeper's credibility or the presumption of mailing does not address the hearsay issue directly.

Thus, the owner's statement is admissible because it is non-hearsay under the admission exception.
