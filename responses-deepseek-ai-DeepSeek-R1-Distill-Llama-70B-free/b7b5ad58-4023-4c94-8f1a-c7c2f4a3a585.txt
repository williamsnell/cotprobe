Okay, so I need to solve this noise power problem. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding the effective input source noise power expressed in dBm. 

Alright, I remember that noise power is related to the temperature and the bandwidth. Oh right, the formula for noise power is P = k * T * B, where k is Boltzmann's constant. Wait, but wait, I think that's when the impedance is matched. Oh, right, because if the impedance isn't matched, there might be some scaling involved. But in this problem, the input and output impedances are both 750 ohms, so I think they're matched. So that part should be straightforward.

Wait, but what's the value of k? I think Boltzmann's constant is 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. And the noise temperature is given as 290 K, which is standard. The bandwidth is 22 kHz, which I should convert into Hz. Oh wait, 22 kHz is 22,000 Hz.

So putting it all together, P = k*T*B. Let me plug in the numbers. P = 1.38e-23 * 290 * 22,000. Let me calculate that step by step. 

First, 1.38e-23 * 290. Let me compute that. 1.38 * 290 is approximately 400.2. So 400.2e-23. Then multiply by 22,000. 22,000 is 2.2e4. So 400.2e-23 * 2.2e4. Let me multiply those numbers.

400.2 * 2.2 is approximately 880.44. And the exponents: 1e-23 * 1e4 = 1e-19. So P = 880.44e-19 J. Wait, but wait, because J is in watts per second, so maybe I'm mixing units here because dBm is related to power in watts.

Wait, no, because dBm is dB relative to 1 mW. So perhaps I should compute the power in watts and then convert to dBm.

Wait, wait, another approach: the noise power available from a source is P = k*T*B, and when the impedance is matched, this is the power delivered to the load. So the formula gives P in watts.

So let me compute P = 1.38e-23 * 290 * 22e3. Let me compute each step:

1.38e-23 * 290 = (1.38 *290)*1e-23. 1.38 *290 = 400.2, so 400.2e-23.

Then multiply by 22e3: 400.2e-23 *22e3 = (400.2 *22) * 1e-23+3.

400.2 *22 is 8804.4. And 1e(-23+3)=1e-20. So P = 8804.4e-20 watts. Wait, 8804.4e-20 is 8.8044e-17 watts? That seems really small, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should check my calculation again. Let's compute 1.38e-23 *290 = 1.38*290=400.2, so 400.2e-23. Multiply by 22,000: 400.2e-23 *22,000.

Wait, 22,000 is 2.2e4. So 400.2e-23 * 2.2e4 = (400.2 *2.2) * 1e-23 +4.

400.2 *2.2 is approximately 880.44. 1e-19? Because 1e-23 *1e4 is 1e-19. So P = 880.44e-19 watts, which is 8.8044e-17 W.

Wait, but I think I might have messed up the exponents. Let me redo the calculation using exponents properly.

1.38e-23 J/(K·s) * 290 K = (1.38 *290) *1e-23 = 400.2e-23 J/s, since J is watts per second, so that's correct.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is P = k*T*B, where B is bandwidth in Hz. So P is in watts. So 1.38e-23 *290 *22e3.

So 1.38e-23 *290 = 1.38 *290 = 400.2, so 400.2e-23.

Then multiply by 22e3: 400.2e-23 *22e3 = (400.2 *22) * 1e-23 *1e3 = 8804.4 *1e-20.

Which is 8.8044e-17 W. Hmm.

Wait, that seems really low. Let me check my approach. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm thinking of is different. Oh wait, another formula comes to mind: noise power in dBm can be calculated using the formula:

Noise power (dBm) = 10 log (k*T*B / (1e-3 W)) 

Wait, because dBm is 10 log(P / 0.001 W). So P is in watts, so 0.001 W is 1 mW.

So let me compute P in watts first.

P = k*T*B = (1.38e-23 J/K) *290 K *22e3 Hz.

Compute this:

1.38e-23 *290 = 1.38 *290 = 400.2, so 400.2e-23.

400.2e-23 *22e3 = 400.2e-23 *2.2e4 = (400.2 *2.2) *1e(-23 +4) = 880.44 *1e-19 = 8.8044e-17 W.

Wait, but that's 8.8e-17 W, which is 0.88e-16 W. Hmm, that's very small. Let me check if I should have used 4k instead of 290K, but no, the source temperature is given as 290K. So that's correct.

Now, converting P to dBm:

dBm = 10 * log10( P / 0.001 )

P is 8.8044e-17 W, so P / 0.001 W = 8.8044e-17 / 1e-3 = 8.8044e-14.

Now, 10 * log10(8.8044e-14) = 10 * [ log10(8.8044) + log10(1e-14) ]

log10(8.8044) is about 0.944. Because 10^0.944 ≈ 8.8.

log10(1e-14) is -14.

So 0.944 -14 = -13.056.

Multiply by 10: -130.56 dBm.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options listed. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recalculate the P.

Wait, 1.38e-23 *290 = 1.38 * 290 = 400.2, so 400.2e-23 J/s (watts).

Then, 400.2e-23 *22e3 = 400.2 *22e3 *1e-23.

Wait, 400.2 *22e3 is 400.2 *22,000 = 8,804,400.

So 8,804,400e-23 = 8.8044e-19 W.

Wait, so P=8.8044e-19 W.

Wait, wait, 22e3 is 22,000, so 22e3 is 2.2e4.

So 400.2e-23 *2.2e4 = 400.2 *2.2 = 880.44, and exponents: 1e-23 *1e4 = 1e-19.

So P=880.44e-19 W = 8.8044e-17 W.

Wait, no, 880.44e-19 is 8.8044e-17 W. Because 880.44 *1e-19 is 8.8044 *1e-17.

So P=8.8044e-17 W.

Now, P in dBm is 10 * log10(P / 1e-3).

So P /1e-3 = 8.8044e-17 W / 1e-3 W = 8.8044e-14.

log10(8.8044e-14) = log10(8.8044) + log10(1e-14) = approx 0.944 -14 = -13.056.

Multiply by 10: -130.56 dBm.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest I see is option H: -134.57, F: -130.22, or D: -124.53, but none exactly match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong formula. Another approach: the noise power in dBm can be calculated using the formula:

N = 10 log (k T B / (1e-3)) )

Wait, that's the same as what I did. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, let's calculate P = k T B.

k = 1.38e-23 J/K
T = 290 K
B =22 kHz =22e3 Hz

P = 1.38e-23 *290 *22e3.

Calculating step by step:

1.38e-23 *290 = (1.38 * 290) = 400.2 → 400.2e-23 J/s.

Then multiply by 22e3: 400.2e-23 *22e3 = (400.2 *22e3) *1e-23.

Wait, 400.2 *22e3 is 400.2 * 22,000 = let's compute that.

400 *22,000 = 8,800,000.

0.2 *22,000 = 4,400. So total is 8,804,400.

So 8,804,400 *1e-23 W = 8.8044e-19 W? Wait, no, 8,804,400e-23 is 8.8044e-19 W.

Wait, 1e-23 *1e6 (because 22e3 is 2.2e4) → 1e-23 *2.2e4 = 2.2e-19, multiplied by 400.2 gives 880.44e-19, which is 8.8044e-17 W.

Wait, why the confusion? Let me clarify exponents.

Wait, 22e3 is 2.2e4, so 400.2e-23 *2.2e4 = 400.2 *2.2 *1e(-23 +4) = 880.44 *1e-19 =8.8044e-17 W.

So P = 8.8044e-17 W.

Now, dBm is 10 * log10(P / 0.001).

P is 8.8044e-17 W.

So P /0.001 W =8.8044e-17 /1e-3 =8.8044e-14.

Now, compute log10(8.8044e-14).

log10(8.8044e-14) = log10(8.8044) + log10(1e-14).

log10(8.8044)= approx 0.944.

log10(1e-14) is -14. So total is 0.944 -14 = -13.056.

Multiply by 10 → -130.56 dBm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F: -130.22, but that's not exact. Hmm, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, maybe I should compute log10(8.8044e-14) more accurately. Let me compute it step by step.

8.8044e-14 = 8.8044 * 1e-14.

log10(8.8044) is approximately 0.944? Let me calculate it more accurately.

Log10(8) is 0.9031, log10(9)=0.9542. 8.8 is between them. Let's compute 8.8.

8.8: log10(8.8) = approx 0.9445.

Yes, so 0.9445 -14 = -13.0555.

Multiply by 10: -130.555 dBm.

So approximately -130.56 dBm.

Looking at the options, option F is -130.22, which is a bit higher. Option H is -134.57, which is lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the formula is expressed in terms of dBm, so using another formula.

Wait, another formula I've heard of is:

Noise power (dBm) = 10 log (T/T0) + 10 log (B) - 105

Where T0 is 290 K, but wait, no, perhaps that's for a different scenario.

Alternatively, I've read that the noise power can be expressed as:

N = 10 log (k T B / (1e-3)) 

Which is what I did before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using precise values.

Compute P = 1.38e-23 *290 *22e3.

1.38e-23 *290 = 400.2e-23.

400.2e-23 *22e3 = 400.2 *22e3 *1e-23.

Compute 400.2 *22e3:

400.2 *22 = 8804.4 → 8804.4e3 → 8,804,400.

So 8,804,400e-23 = 8.8044e-19 W.

Wait, 8,804,400e-23 = 8.8044e-19 W.

Wait, no, 8,804,400e-23 is 8.8044e-19 W. Because 1e-23 multiplied by 8.8044e6 (since 8,804,400 is 8.8044e6)? No, wait, 8,804,400 is 8.8044e6? Let me think: 1e6 is a million, so 8 million is 8e6, so 8,804,400 is 8.8044e6. So 8.8044e6 *1e-23 =8.8044e-17 W.

Ah, so P=8.8044e-17 W.

So P =8.8044e-17 W.

Now, let's compute the dBm.

dBm = 10 * log10(8.8044e-17 / 1e-3) = 10 * log10(8.8044e-14).

Compute log10(8.8044e-14):

log10(8.8044) is approximately 0.9445, as before. log10(1e-14) is -14. So total is 0.9445 -14 = -13.0555.

Multiply by 10: -130.555 dBm.

So approximately -130.56 dBm.

Looking back at the options, option F is -130.22 and option H is -134.57. Hmm, I don't see -130.56 as an option, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again, more accurately.

Let me compute the exact value of log10(8.8044e-14).

So 8.8044e-14 = 8.8044 × 10^-14.

log10(8.8044) is approximately 0.9445.

So log10(8.8044e-14) = 0.9445 -14 = -13.0555.

Multiply by 10 gives -130.555, which is -130.56 dBm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F: -130.22. But why the discrepancy? Maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using precise values without approximations.

Wait, let me compute 1.38e-23 *290 = exactly 1.38 *290 = 400.2, yes.

400.2e-23 *22e3 = 400.2 *22e3 * 1e-23.

400.2 *22e3 = 400.2 *22000 = let's compute that.

400 *22000 = 8,800,000.

0.2 *22000=4,400. So total is 8,804,400.

So 8,804,400e-23 = 8.8044e-19 W? Wait, no, because 8,804,400 is 8.8044e6. So 8.8044e6 *1e-23 =8.8044e-17 W.

Wait, I think I've got that right.

So P =8.8044e-17 W.

Now, P in dBm is 10*log10(P/1e-3) = 10*log10(8.8044e-14).

Compute 8.8044e-14.

Let me compute log10(8.8044e-14) precisely.

We can write this as log10(8.8044) + log10(1e-14) = log10(8.8044) -14.

log10(8.8044) can be calculated more accurately.

I know that 10^0.94 = approx 8.71, because 10^0.9=7.943, 10^0.94= approx 8.71.

Wait, let me compute 10^0.9445.

0.9445 in exponents: 10^0.94 = ?

Let me use the Taylor series or a calculator-like approach.

Wait, alternatively, use natural logs.

log10(x) = ln(x)/ln(10).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to accept that log10(8.8044)=0.9445.

So log10(8.8044e-14)=0.9445 -14 = -13.0555.

Multiply
