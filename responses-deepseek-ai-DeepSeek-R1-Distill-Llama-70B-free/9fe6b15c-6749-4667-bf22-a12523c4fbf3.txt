Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Allport's concept of functional autonomy and how it differs from other theories of motivation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my psychology theories, but let me try to work through this.

First, I remember that Allport was a personality theorist. He's known for his trait theory, right? So functional autonomy must be part of that. From what I recall, functional autonomy refers to the idea that adult motives are not driven by the same needs they were in childhood. So like, as people grow, their motivations become more independent of their original purposes.

Wait, other theories—I think most theories of motivation, like Freud's psychoanalysis or maybe even behaviorist theories, tie current behavior to past experiences. Freud definitely focuses on childhood experiences shaping adult behavior. Behavioral theories might look at past learning experiences influencing current actions through conditioning.

So Allport's functional autonomy would argue that current motives aren't directly tied to past history. Instead, they've become independent. So for example, if someone started playing a sport because their parents pushed them, over time, they might play because they genuinely enjoy it—so the motivation becomes self-sustaining and separate from the original reason.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Functional autonomy permits a relative divorce from the past of the organism. That sounds right because it's about motives becoming independent of their origin.

Option B: Maintains current motives tied to history. That's the opposite of what I was thinking, so B is probably incorrect.

Option C: Behavior is reaction to immediate stimuli. That sounds more like a behaviorist or stimulus-response theory, not Allport.

Option D: Motivation decreases with age. I don't remember Allport saying anything about that. Maybe it's someone else's theory.

Option E: Relies on biological drives. That's more like Freud or maybe Maslow, not Allport's trait theory.

Option F: Behavior from learned associations. That's behaviorism again, like Skinner, not Allport.

Option G: External rewards and punishments. Again, behaviorism. Allport's theory is more about internal traits.

Option H: Emphasizes past experiences. No, Allport moves away from past, so H is wrong.

Option I: Constant biological reinforcement. Doesn't ring a bell. Maybe something else, not Allport.

Option J: Only early childhood. No, functional autonomy is about adults, so J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be A. It says the motives are somewhat divorced from the past, which aligns with Allport's idea that adult motives become functionally autonomous.

The correct answer is A: Functional autonomy permits a relative divorce from the past of the organism.

Allport's concept of functional autonomy suggests that adult motives become independent of their original causes and are no longer tied to past experiences. This differs from other theories that emphasize the influence of history or conditioning on current behavior. 

Answer: A
