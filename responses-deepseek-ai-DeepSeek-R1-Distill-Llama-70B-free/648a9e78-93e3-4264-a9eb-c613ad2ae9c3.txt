Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a cooling system, and I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: A cooling system maintains a refrigerator at -25°C in a room that's at +25°C. The heat transfer into the refrigerator is 10^4 J per minute. The system operates at 50% of its maximum thermodynamic efficiency. I need to estimate the power requirement, and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm. Alright, so I remember that when dealing with refrigerators, the coefficient of performance (COP) is important. The COP is the ratio of the heat removed from the cold reservoir to the work input. But wait, the problem mentions thermodynamic efficiency, which I think might relate to the Carnot efficiency. Oh right, the maximum efficiency a heat engine can achieve is given by the Carnot efficiency.

Wait, but wait. Refrigerators are a bit different. The Carnot refrigerator's COP is different from a heat engine's efficiency. Let me think. The maximum COP for a refrigerator operating between two temperatures is given by COP_Carnot = Tc / (Th - Tc), where Tc is the temperature of the cold reservoir and Th is the hot reservoir. But wait, that's in Kelvin, right?

So first, I should convert the temperatures to Kelvin. The refrigerator is at -25°C, which is 258.15 K (since 0°C is 273.15K, so 273.15 -25 = 248.15? Wait wait, no: wait, no, -25°C is 273.15 -25 = 248.15 K. The room is at +25°C, which is 298.15 K.

Wait no, wait. Let me double-check. 0°C is 273.15 K. So -25°C is 273.15 -25 = 248.15 K. And 25°C is 273.15 +25 = 298.15 K.

So COP_Carnot = Tc / (Th - Tc). So that's 248.15 / (298.15 - 248.15) = 248.15 / 50 = about 4.963. Wait, let me calculate that exactly. 248.15 divided by 50 is 4.963, yeah.

But the system is operating at 50% of its maximum thermodynamic efficiency. Wait, so does that mean the COP is 50% of the Carnot COP? That's what I think. So the actual COP would be 0.5 * 4.963 ≈ 2.4815.

Wait, wait. COP is the heat removed (Qc) over the work input (W). So COP = Qc / W. So if I can find Qc, and I know the COP, I can find W, the work done.

Wait, the problem states that the heat transfer into the refrigerator is 10^4 J per minute. Wait, the heat transfer into the refrigerator: wait, no, that's the heat being removed from the refrigerator. Because the refrigerator is at a lower temperature, so heat is being pumped out into the room. Wait, wait no, the problem says "heat transfer into the refrigerator" is 10^4 J/min. Hmm. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think.

In a refrigerator, the working fluid absorbs heat from the cold reservoir (inside the fridge) and releases it to the hot reservoir (the room). So the heat transfer into the refrigerator would be Qc, the heat removed from the inside. So the heat transfer into the refrigerator is Qc = 10^4 J per minute.

Wait, actually, that might be a point of confusion. The heat transfer into the refrigerator—wait, the refrigerator's inside is cold, so heat is flowing out of the refrigerator into the room. Or wait, no. The refrigerator is the cold reservoir, so the system pumps heat from the cold reservoir (inside) to the hot reservoir (room). So Qc is the heat extracted from the cold reservoir. So the problem says this heat transfer is 10^4 J per minute.

So yes, Qc = 10^4 J per minute.

But wait, the units here are per minute, and power is in watts, which is joules per second. So I'll have to convert that.

So, the COP is 2.4815. COP = Qc / W.

So W = Qc / COP.

But let me write it out:

COP = Qc / W => W = Qc / COP.

So, Qc is 1e4 J per minute. Let's convert that to per second. Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, 1e4 J/60 s = approx 166.666... J/s, which is about 166.67 watts. Wait, no, wait, that's the rate of heat transfer. So Qc is 1e4 J per minute, which is 10000 / 60 = approx 166.6667 J/s.

So, W = Qc / COP.

Wait, but wait. Qc is 1e4 J per minute, which is 10000 J / 60 s = 166.6667 J/s. So W would be (166.6667 J/s) / 2.4815 ≈ let's compute that.

166.6667 / 2.4815 ≈ approximately 67.2 watts.

Wait, but let me check: 2.4815 times 67 is about 166.5, so yes, that makes sense.

So the power requirement W is approximately 67.2 watts. Looking at the options, option J is 67.4 watts. That's very close. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, converting temperatures to Kelvin: correct.

Calculating Carnot COP as Tc/(Th-Tc): correct.

Then, actual COP is 50% of that, so 0.5 * 4.963 = 2.4815: correct.

Then, Qc is 1e4 J per minute, which is 10000/60 J/s ≈ 166.6667 J/s: correct.

Then, W = Qc / COP = 166.6667 / 2.4815 ≈ 67.2 W: correct.

Looking at the options, J is 67.4, which is very close. So the correct answer is J.

To determine the power requirement of the cooling system, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Temperatures**:  
   - Refrigerator temperature: \( T_c = -25^\circ \text{C} = 248.15 \, \text{K} \)  
   - Ambient temperature: \( T_h = 25^\circ \text{C} = 298.15 \, \text{K} \)  

2. **Maximum thermodynamic efficiency**:  
   The maximum coefficient of performance (COP) for a Carnot refrigerator is given by:  
   \[
   \text{COP}_{\text{Carnot}} = \frac{T_c}{T_h - T_c}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{COP}_{\text{Carnot}} = \frac{248.15}{298.15 - 248.15} = \frac{248.15}{50} \approx 4.963
   \]  

   Since the system operates at 50% of its maximum thermodynamic efficiency, the actual COP is:  
   \[
   \text{COP} = 0.5 \times \text{COP}_{\text{Carnot}} = 0.5 \times 4.963 \approx 2.4815
   \]  

3. **Heat transfer rate**:  
   The heat transfer into the refrigerator is given as \( Q_c = 10^4 \, \text{J/min} \). Converting this to watts (J/s):  
   \[
   Q_c = \frac{10^4}{60} \approx 166.67 \, \text{W}
   \]  

4. **Power requirement**:  
   The power input \( W \) required to operate the refrigerator is related to the COP and \( Q_c \) by:  
   \[
   W = \frac{Q_c}{\text{COP}}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   W = \frac{166.67}{2.4815} \approx 67.2 \, \text{W}
   \]  

5. **Final answer**:  
   The closest option to the calculated power requirement is **67.4 W**, which corresponds to option **J**.

Answer: J
