Okay, so I've got this question here with two statements, and I need to figure out if each is true or false. Let's take it step by step.

First, statement (1) says, "In every country, people think other individuals in their country are less happy than they actually are." Hmm, I remember reading something about perception of happiness. I think it's related to something called the "unhappy others" bias or something like that. Wait, or was it the opposite? Maybe people think others are happier than they are? No, wait, I think it's the other way around. Like, people might underestimate others' happiness. So statement (1) is suggesting that in every country, people believe others are less happy than they really are. So if that's a common bias, then statement (1) would be true. But wait, is it every country? I'm not sure if this applies universally. Maybe it's more of a general trend rather than every single country. So perhaps statement (1) is partially true or mostly true but not entirely in every place.

Now, statement (2) claims, "In the United States, women’s happiness has increased both absolutely and relative to men." I'm trying to recall data on this. I think there was a study that showed women's happiness has actually declined relative to men in the US. Or wait, maybe the opposite. Let me think. I remember reading that women's life satisfaction has decreased compared to men over the past few decades. Oh wait, no—another angle: perhaps in terms of absolute happiness, women are less happy now than before. Or maybe their happiness has increased, but not as much as men's, so relative to men, it's decreased. Or maybe the statement is saying that both absolutely (their own happiness) and relative (compared to men) have gone up. Wait, I'm a bit confused. I think I read that women's happiness in the US has actually declined in recent decades, both in absolute terms and relative to men. So statement (2) would be false because it's saying the opposite.

Putting it together, statement (1) is true in many places, but the question says "every country," which might be too broad. So statement (1) is maybe partially true or true. Statement (2) sounds false because I think women's happiness hasn't increased relative to men; if anything, it's the opposite.

Wait, maybe I should think again about statement (1). I think the "unhappy others" idea is that people think others are less happy than themselves, which would mean that people underestimate others' happiness. So statement (1) says, "people think others are less happy than they actually are," which aligns with that. So (1) is true. But does this happen in every country? I'm not certain. Maybe some cultures have different perceptions. But perhaps the statement is generally true, so (1) is true.

Then for statement (2), if women's happiness hasn't increased relative to men, then statement (2) is false. So statement (1) is true, statement (2) is false.

Looking at the options, E is True, False. So the correct answer would be E.

The first statement suggests that in every country, people underestimate others' happiness, which aligns with the "unhappy others" bias and is generally true. The second statement claims that women’s happiness in the U.S. has increased both absolutely and relative to men, but evidence suggests the opposite, making this statement false.

Answer: E
