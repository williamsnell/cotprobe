Question:

A doctor is concerned about the relationship between blood pressure and irregular heartbeats. Among her patients, she classifies blood pressures as high, normal, or low and heartbeats as regular or irregular and finds that 16\% have high blood pressure; (b) 19\% have low blood pressure; (c) $17 \%$ have an irregular heartbeat; (d) of those with an irregular heartbeat, $35 \%$ have high blood pressure; and (e) of those with normal blood pressure, $11 \%$ have an irregular heartbeat. What percentage of her patients have a regular heartbeat and low blood pressure?

Options:

A: 18.7%
B: 10.2%

D: 14.0%
E: 8.6%
F: 22.9%
G: 20.4%
H:  15.1%

Okay, so I've got this problem about a doctor studying the relationship between blood pressure and heartbeats. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Let's see, the data given is:

- 16% have high blood pressure.
- 19% have low blood pressure.
- So the remaining must have normal blood pressure. Since percentages add up to 100, normal would be 100 -16 -19 = 65%. Wait, wait, that can't be right because high and low are 16 and 19, which sum to 35, so 100-35=65. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, heartbeats are either regular or irregular. 17% have irregular heartbeats, so the rest, 83%, have regular.

Now the tricky part comes in with the conditional probabilities. 

Point (d) says that of those with irregular heartbeats, 35% have high blood pressure. So let's think about that. So 35% of the 17% who have irregular heartbeats have high BP. That would be 0.35 * 17 = 5.95%. So 5.95% of all patients are in the high BP and irregular heartbeat category.

Point (e) says that of those with normal blood pressure, 11% have irregular heartbeats. Wait, so 11% of the 65% have irregular. That's 0.11 *65 = 7.15%. So 7.15% are normal BP and irregular heartbeat.

Now, I think I can make a table or a contingency matrix to visualize this better. Let's outline the possible categories.

The categories are:

Blood Pressure (High, Normal, Low) and Heartbeat (Regular, Irregular).

We can create a 2x3 table, but maybe it's easier to split it into parts.

First, let's handle the irregular heartbeat group because we have their percentages.

Total irregular heartbeat =17% of all patients.

From (d), within irregular, 35% have high BP. So 35% of 17% is 5.95% as I calculated. Then, the rest of the irregular heartbeat patients must have either normal or low BP.

Wait, the rest would be 100% -35% =65% of 17% = 11.05%. But wait, point (e) tells us that of normal BP patients, 11% have irregular heartbeats. So the 7.15% comes from the normal BP category. So what about the low BP and irregular category?

So, the irregular heartbeat group is 17% in total. Of these, 35% are high BP (5.95%) and 11% of normal BP patients are irregular (7.15%). Wait, no, 11% of normal BP is 7.15% of all patients. So in the irregular group, that 7.15% is a subset. So the remaining in irregular would be in low BP.

So, total irregular =17% = high_irr + normal_irr + low_irr.

We know high_irr =5.95%, normal_irr=7.15%, so low_irr =17-5.95-7.15 = 3.9%? Wait, let me calculate that again.

Wait 5.95 +7.15 =13.1, so 17-13.1 =3.9. So yes, low_irr is 3.9% of all patients.

Wait, but let me check another way. Because point (e) says that 11% of normal BP have irregular. So normal BP is 65%, 11% of that is 7.15% as I said. So that 7.15% is part of the irregular heartbeat group, which is 17% of all patients. So yes, the 7.15% is part of that 17%.

So, in the irregular group:

- High BP: 5.95%
- Normal BP:7.15%
- Low BP: 3.9%

Let me check if 5.95 +7.15 +3.9 =17%. 5.95 is 6 approx, 7.15 is 7, 3.9 is 4. So 6+7=13, 13+4=17. Yeah, adding up.

Now, I think the question is asking for the percentage of patients who have regular heartbeat and low blood pressure. So that's the regular heartbeat group (83% of all patients) and low BP (19% of all patients). But wait, that's not correct because some of the low BP have irregular heartbeats, and some have regular. So I need to find the percentage of low BP that have regular heartbeats.

Because, from the data, of the low BP group, how many have regular heartbeats? Well, we know that 3.9% of all patients are low BP and irregular. So since low BP is 19% of all patients, the regular heartbeat portion would be 19% -3.9% =15.1%.

Wait, that math seems right. Because 3.9% of the total are low BP and irregular, so the rest of the low BP must have regular heartbeats. So 19% -3.9% =15.1%.

Looking at the options, 15.1% is option H. So the answer would be H.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm all the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, to find the percentage with low BP and regular heartbeat, we can subtract the percentage with low BP and irregular from the total low BP percentage.

Total low BP:19% of all patients.

Low BP and irregular:3.9% (as calculated earlier).

So 19% -3.9% =15.1%, which is option H.

Yes, that seems correct.

To determine the percentage of patients with a regular heartbeat and low blood pressure, we analyze the given data:

1. **Blood Pressure Distribution**:  
   - High blood pressure: 16%  
   - Normal blood pressure: 65% (calculated as 100% - 16% - 19%)  
   - Low blood pressure: 19%  

2. **Heartbeat Classification**:  
   - Irregular heartbeat: 17%  
   - Regular heartbeat: 83% (calculated as 100% - 17%)  

3. **Conditional Probabilities**:  
   - Of those with irregular heartbeats, 35% have high blood pressure. This corresponds to \( 0.35 \times 17\% = 5.95\% \) of all patients.  
   - Of those with normal blood pressure, 11% have irregular heartbeats. This corresponds to \( 0.11 \times 65\% = 7.15\% \) of all patients.  

4. **Calculating Low Blood Pressure and Irregular Heartbeat**:  
   - Total irregular heartbeat: 17%  
   - Irregular heartbeat with high blood pressure: 5.95%  
   - Irregular heartbeat with normal blood pressure: 7.15%  
   - Remaining irregular heartbeat must be with low blood pressure:  
     \[
     17\% - 5.95\% - 7.15\% = 3.9\%
     \]  

5. **Calculating Low Blood Pressure and Regular Heartbeat**:  
   - Total low blood pressure: 19%  
   - Low blood pressure with irregular heartbeat: 3.9%  
   - Low blood pressure with regular heartbeat:  
     \[
     19\% - 3.9\% = 15.1\%
     \]  

Thus, the percentage of patients with a regular heartbeat and low blood pressure is **15.1%**.
