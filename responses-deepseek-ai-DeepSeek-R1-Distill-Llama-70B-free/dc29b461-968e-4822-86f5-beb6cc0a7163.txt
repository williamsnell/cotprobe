Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about inoculating someone against a persuasive message. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

So, the term "inoculate" here is metaphorical, right? Like how a vaccine inoculates against a disease. So, in a social psychology context, inoculation theory suggests that exposing someone to a weakened form of an opposing argument can help them build resistance against more persuasive messages later on.

The question is asking what method is used to inoculate someone. The options are from A to J. Let me go through each one and see which fits.

Option A: Provide strong arguments against her beliefs. Hmm, wait. If you give someone strong arguments against their beliefs, that might actually persuade them, not inoculate. Inoculation isn't about defeating the person's beliefs but making them resistant. So maybe this isn't it.

Option B: Discredit the source. That sounds like a different tactic, maybe related to undermining credibility. I think that's more about attacking the source rather than building resilience against the message itself.

Option C: Warn about an upcoming persuasive message. Oh, this rings a bell. I remember something about forewarning. Yes, if you tell someone they're about to hear a persuasive message, they might prepare counterarguments. That's part of inoculation techniques. So C could be a contender.

Option D: Ignore and avoid discussing. That doesn't sound active enough. Inoculation requires some engagement, not just avoidance. So probably not D.

Option E: Provide arguments against her beliefs and weak refutations. This sounds familiar. So you present opposing arguments but then refute them weakly. The idea is that when the person faces stronger arguments later, they'll have practiced countering them. So this is a form of inoculation. Wait, but I thought it's about giving a weakened version of the opposing argument so the person can build their own defenses.

Option F: Reiterate current beliefs. Strengthening existing beliefs might make them more resistant, but isn't that more like reinforcing rather than inoculating? I'm not sure if that's the same as inoculation.

Option G: Distract during the message. That's more about preventing the message from being processed, not building resistance. So probably not G.

Option H: Provide weak arguments supporting her beliefs. That might not be effective because weak arguments don't build strong defenses. Inoculation needs the person to have some defense against stronger attacks, so this might not be the right approach.

Option I: Encourage disregarding opposing beliefs. That sounds like ignoring rather than addressing the opposing views. Inoculation involves acknowledging and countering them, so I don't think this is it.

Option J: Provide information supporting current beliefs. That's similar to option F and H. It's about reinforcing, not inoculating against future persuasion.

Wait, so the main contenders are C and E. Let me think again. Inoculation can be done in two ways: one is the "inoculation approach" where you present a weakened opposing argument along with a refutation, so the person learns to counter it. The other is the "forewarning" method, where you warn the person that they'll be exposed to persuasion, prompting them to generate their own counterarguments.

So option E is about giving arguments against her beliefs and then weak refutations. That would help her build defenses. Option C is about warning her about the message, which also works but is a different method.

The question is asking which action would inoculate someone. So both methods are part of inoculation. But looking at the options, I need to choose which one is correct.

Wait, the question mentions "inoculate against a persuasive message." The classic inoculation involves giving a small dose of the argument and then refuting it. So option E seems to fit that description. Because you provide the opposing arguments and then weakly refute them, which helps the person build their own stronger defenses.

Alternatively, option C is about forewarning, which is another technique but perhaps not the primary method. So the correct answer might be E.

Wait, but another angle: sometimes inoculation is done by exposing people to the same persuasive message in a weakened form so they can build resistance. So in that case, option E would be providing opposing arguments (the weakened form) and then refuting them, which might be the correct method.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is E: provide the person with arguments against her beliefs and weak refutations of those arguments.

To "inoculate" someone against a persuasive message, the most effective method involves exposing them to a weakened version of opposing arguments and then providing weak refutations of those arguments. This allows the person to build their own defenses and resistance against stronger persuasive messages they may encounter later. Among the options provided, the one that aligns with this approach is:

E: Provide the person with arguments against her beliefs and weak refutations of those arguments.

This method is consistent with the inoculation theory, which aims to strengthen resistance by exposing individuals to a mild form of counterarguments and helping them practice countering those arguments.

Answer: E
