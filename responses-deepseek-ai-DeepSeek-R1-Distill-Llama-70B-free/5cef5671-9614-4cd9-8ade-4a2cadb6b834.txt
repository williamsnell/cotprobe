Question:

In 1985, a landowner, the undisputed owner of an apartment building, leased it to a tenant for a term of seven years. Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the landowner died leaving no heirs. In her will, the landowner left her entire estate to the Girl Scouts of America. The apartment building was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the landowner died, the tenant, having learned of the landowner's death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Girl Scouts of America organization was unaware of the landowner's gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Girl Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the apartment building. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. In an ejection action by the Girl Scouts of America against the tenant, the organization will prevail

Options:

A: if the tenant believed that his lease with the landowner was still in effect after the latter died.
B: because the Girl Scouts of America did not know about their ownership until 2009.
C: because the tenant discontinued paying rent following the landowner's death.
D: if the tenant was never formally notified about the landowner's will.
E: if the tenant leased the apartment building to a teacher for three years while he (the tenant) was called into military service.
F: because the statutory period for adverse possession had not yet been reached.
G: if the tenant claimed to have bought the apartment building from the landowner before her death.
H: because the tenant never paid taxes on the apartment building.
I: if the tenant made significant improvements to the apartment building.

Okay, so I've got this legal problem here about adverse possession and lease agreements. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

So, the setup is that a landowner leased an apartment building to a tenant for seven years starting in 1985. The rent was monthly, due on the first of each month. Then, in 1986, the landowner died without any heirs, and her will left everything to the Girl Scouts of America. The apartment wasn't specifically mentioned in the will, so I guess it passed as part of the residue. 

The tenant found out about the landowner's death a month later and decided to stay but stopped paying rent. Now, the Girl Scouts didn't know about the gift until 2009 when their attorneys did an inventory. The statutory period for adverse possession here is 20 years. The question is whether the Girl Scouts will prevail in an ejection action against the tenant.

Wait, so the options are about different scenarios, and I need to pick which one makes the Girl Scouts win. 

First, I should think about what happens when a landlord dies and there's a lease. Normally, the lease continues with the new owner, right? So when the landowner died, her estate would take over, and since she left everything to the Girl Scouts, they became the new landlords. But the tenant stopped paying rent after the landowner's death. 

But here's the thing: the tenant was a tenant under a lease. So the lease would typically bind the new owner (the Girl Scouts) as the lease is still in effect. So the tenant's obligation to pay rent continues unless the lease is terminated. 

But the tenant stopped paying rent. So the question is, does that mean the tenant is now a trespasser, or is the lease still in effect? Because if the lease is still in effect, the tenant can't be evicted just for non-payment unless the landlord takes action, like eviction proceedings. But wait, the Girl Scouts didn't know they owned the property until 2009. So from 1986 to 2009, the tenant was living there without paying rent. 

But wait, the lease was for seven years, so it started in 1985 and would end in 1992. So the lease term ended in 1992, right? So after that, if the tenant stayed on without a new lease, they might become a tenant at will or a tenant at sufferance. But the lease was until 1992, so after that, the tenant's status changes. 

Wait, but the lease was for seven years, so it's a fixed term. So after 1992, the tenant would be a holdover tenant, right? Because the lease ended, and they didn't leave. So the Girl Scouts, as the new owners, could have started eviction then. But they didn't know about it until 2009. 

So the tenant stayed from 1986 (when the landowner died) until 2009, which is 23 years. The statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years. So if the tenant was in adverse possession for 20 years, they could gain title. 

But wait, the tenant was a leaseholder, so initially, they had the landlord's permission to be there. So the possession under the lease isn't adverse. But once the lease ends, and they stay without permission, that's when adverse possession could start. 

So the lease ended in 1992. From 1992 to 2009 is 17 years. The statutory period is 20, so the 17 years aren't enough. So the tenant hasn't completed the adverse possession period yet. Therefore, the Girl Scouts can evict them because the tenant's possession isn't adverse for the full 20 years. 

Looking at the options, option F says because the statutory period hadn't been reached. So that would mean the Girl Scouts would prevail because the tenant can't claim adverse possession yet. 

Wait, but when did the lease end? Let me double-check. The lease was in 1985 for seven years. So 1985 +7 =1992. So the lease ended in 1992. The tenant stayed until 2009, which is 17 years after the lease ended. But the statutory period is 20, so he hasn't met it yet. So adverse possession requires 20 years, which he hasn't completed. Therefore, the Girl Scouts can eject him because his possession isn't adverse for the full period. 

So the correct answer would be F. 

Wait, but option C says because the tenant stopped paying rent. But under the lease, the rent was due, but if the lease is still in effect, stopping payment could lead to eviction for breach of lease, not necessarily adverse possession. But the lease ended in 1992, so after that, the tenant was a holdover. So the Girl Scouts could have evicted him for holding over, but they didn't know. 

So the issue is whether the tenant's possession after the lease ended counts toward adverse possession. From 1992 to 2009 is 17 years. Since the statutory period is 20, he hasn't completed it. So the Girl Scouts can eject him because he hasn't acquired title through adverse possession yet. 

So the answer is F.

The scenario involves a tenant who leased an apartment building in 1985 for a term of seven years. The landowner died in 1986, leaving the property to the Girl Scouts of America through her will. The tenant stopped paying rent after the landowner's death but remained on the property. The Girl Scouts were unaware of their ownership until 2009, and the statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years.

Key points to consider:

1. **Lease Term and Expiration**: The lease was for seven years, ending in 1992. After the lease expired, the tenant became a holdover tenant, as they remained on the property without a new lease.

2. **Adverse Possession Requirements**: Adverse possession requires continuous, open, hostile, and exclusive possession of the property for the statutory period (20 years in this case). The tenant's possession under the lease was permissive and not adverse. Adverse possession could only begin after the lease expired in 1992.

3. **Time Period for Adverse Possession**: From 1992 to 2009, the tenant occupied the property for 17 years. Since the statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years, the tenant has not yet completed the required period to gain title through adverse possession.

4. **Girl Scouts' Right to Eject**: The Girl Scouts, as the rightful owners, can prevail in an ejection action because the tenant's possession does not meet the 20-year requirement for adverse possession. Additionally, the tenant's failure to pay rent after the lease expired does not affect the Girl Scouts' ability to eject, as the tenant's possession is not legally protected under adverse possession.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is based on the fact that the statutory period for adverse possession had not yet been reached by the tenant.

**Answer: F**
