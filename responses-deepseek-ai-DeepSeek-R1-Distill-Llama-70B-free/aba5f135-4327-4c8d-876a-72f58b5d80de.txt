Okay, so I've got this question about steady incompressible flow. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it. The question asks which of the given functions u and v are possible for a steady incompressible flow. There are three options: a, b, and c. And then the choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what's the condition for a flow to be steady and incompressible? Oh right, for incompressible flow, the divergence of the velocity field must be zero. Because in incompressible flow, the density is constant, so the continuity equation becomes divergence of velocity equals zero. And for steady flow, the partial derivatives with respect to time are zero, but I think that doesn't affect the divergence condition here.

So I need to compute the divergence of each (u, v) pair and see if it's zero.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option (a): u = kxy + y, v = kxy + x.

Wait, wait. Let me write these correctly. Wait u is k x y plus y? Or is it k times (x y + y)? No, the way it's written is u = kxy + y. So u = k x y + y. Similarly, v is k x y + x.

So the divergence is the partial derivative of u with respect to x plus the partial derivative of v with respect to y.

Calculating for option (a):

∂u/∂x = k y + 0 (since y is treated as a variable, but when taking the partial derivative with respect to x, y is constant). So ∂u/∂x = k y.

∂v/∂y = k x + 0 (since the term is x, which is treated as a variable; wait, no, wait. v = k x y + x. So the derivative with respect to y of v: k x (since derivative of x y with respect to y is x) plus 0 (since x is treated as a variable when taking the derivative with respect to y). So ∂v/∂y = k x.

Wait, wait, but for incompressible flow, the divergence is ∂u/∂x + ∂v/∂y. So that's (k y) + (k x) = k(x + y). For this to be zero for all x and y, k must be zero, but the problem doesn't state that k is zero. So unless k is zero, the divergence isn't zero. But the problem gives u and v as functions, so unless k is specified as zero, this won't satisfy divergence zero. So option (a) isn't incompressible unless k=0, which isn't stated. So (a) is not a possible function for incompressible flow.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Option (a): u = k x y + y. So ∂u/∂x is k*y. Correct. And v = k x y + x. ∂v/∂y is k*x. So divergence is k(y + x). Unless k is zero, that's not zero. So (a) can't be incompressible. So (a) is invalid.

Moving on to option (b): u = x² + y², v = -2x y.

Compute the divergence: ∂u/∂x + ∂v/∂y.

∂u/∂x is 2x. ∂v/∂y is -2x. So 2x + (-2x) = 0. Oh, so the divergence is zero. So this satisfies incompressibility. So option (b) is acceptable.

Now option (c): u = x y² + x + y², and v = x(x - y) + 3 y³.

Let me compute ∂u/∂x and ∂v/∂y.

First, u = x y² + x + y². So ∂u/∂x is y² + 1 (because derivative of x y² is y², derivative of x is 1, and derivative of y² with respect to x is zero).

v is x(x - y) + 3 y³. Let's expand that: x² - x y + 3 y³. So ∂v/∂y is derivative of x² is 0, derivative of -x y is -x, and derivative of 3 y³ is 9 y². So ∂v/∂y = (-x) + 9 y².

Adding ∂u/∂x and ∂v/∂y: (y² + 1) + (-x +9 y²) = y² +1 -x +9 y² = 10 y² -x +1.

Wait, for incompressibility, this must be zero everywhere. But 10 y² -x +1 =0 is not possible for all x and y. So the divergence isn't zero. So option (c) doesn't satisfy incompressibility.

Wait, but wait, did I make a mistake in calculating the derivatives?

Let me check again.

u = x y² + x + y².

∂u/∂x: derivative of x y² is y². Derivative of x is 1. Derivative of y² is zero. So correct, y² +1.

v = x(x - y) +3 y³.

Let me expand v: x² - x y +3 y³.

So ∂v/∂y: derivative of x² is 0. Derivative of -x y with respect to y is -x. Derivative of 3 y³ is 9 y². So yes, ∂v/∂y = -x + 9 y².

So divergence is y² +1 -x +9 y² =10 y² -x +1.

Which is not zero. So option (c) is not incompressible.

So, to recap:

Option (a): divergence is k(x + y) → not zero unless k=0, but k is a parameter. So (a) is invalid.

Option (b): divergence is zero. Valid.

Option (c): divergence is 10 y² -x +1 → not zero. Invalid.

So among the options, only option (b) is valid.

Looking at the choices, the options are A to J. The question is which of the functions are possible for a steady incompressible flow. So the functions in (b) are acceptable; (a) and (c) are not.

So the correct options would be only (b). Let's see the options:

Options:

E: b.

So the correct answer should be E.

Wait wait, let me make sure I read the options correctly. The question presents options a, b, c, and the choices are combinations.

Wait, the choices are:

A: none

B: a and c

C: a, b, and c

D: c

E: b

F: b and c

G: a and b

H: a

I: all

J: c and d (Wait, but the question only has a,b,c. So perhaps a typo, but J mentions c and d which doesn't make sense.)

So the correct functions are only (b), so the correct choice is E.

To determine which of the given functions \( u \) and \( v \) are possible for a steady incompressible flow, we need to check if the divergence of the velocity field is zero. The divergence is calculated as:

\[
\text{divergence} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}.
\]

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### (a) \( u = kxy + y \), \( v = kxy + x \)
- \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = ky\), \(\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = kx\).
- Divergence: \( ky + kx = k(x + y) \).
- For incompressibility, \( k(x + y) = 0 \) must hold for all \( x \) and \( y \), which is only true if \( k = 0 \). Since \( k \) is not specified as zero, this option does not satisfy incompressibility.

#### (b) \( u = x^2 + y^2 \), \( v = -2xy \)
- \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 2x\), \(\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = -2x\).
- Divergence: \( 2x - 2x = 0 \).
- The divergence is zero, so this option satisfies incompressibility.

#### (c) \( u = xy^2 + x + y^2 \), \( v = x(x - y) + 3y^3 \)
- \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = y^2 + 1\), \(\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = -x + 9y^2\).
- Divergence: \( y^2 + 1 - x + 9y^2 = 10y^2 - x + 1 \).
- This expression is not zero for all \( x \) and \( y \), so this option does not satisfy incompressibility.

### Conclusion:
- Option (a) is invalid because the divergence is not zero unless \( k = 0 \), which is not specified.
- Option (b) is valid as the divergence is zero.
- Option (c) is invalid because the divergence is not zero.

Thus, only option (b) satisfies the condition for a steady incompressible flow.

### Final Answer:
E
