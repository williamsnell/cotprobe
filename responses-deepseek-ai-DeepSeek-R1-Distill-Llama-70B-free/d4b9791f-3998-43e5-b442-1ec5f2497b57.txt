Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here about the function f(x) = x³ + 2x² – 9x – 18. I'm supposed to figure out which of the statements A through J is true. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that to analyze the behavior of a cubic function, I should probably look at its first derivative to find where it's increasing or decreasing. Also, finding critical points and possibly the second derivative for concavity might help. Oh, and maybe I should check for real roots of f(x) because some options are about the number of real solutions.

Let me start by finding the first derivative of f(x). The derivative, f'(x), is 3x² + 4x – 9. To find critical points, I set this equal to zero: 3x² + 4x – 9 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, x = [-4 ± sqrt(16 + 108)] / (2*3) = [-4 ± sqrt(124)] /6. Sqrt(124) is about 11.135, so the solutions are approximately (7.135)/6 ≈ 1.189 and (-15.135)/6 ≈ -2.523. So the critical points are around x ≈ 1.189 and x ≈ -2.523.

These points divide the number line into intervals. I can test these intervals to see where the function is increasing or decreasing. Let's pick test points in each interval:

1. For x < -2.523, let's take x = -3. Plugging into f'(x): 3*(-3)^2 +4*(-3) –9 = 27 -12 –9 = 6. Positive, so the function is increasing here.

2. Between -2.523 and 1.189, let's try x=0. f'(0)=0+0–9= -9. Negative, so decreasing.

3. For x > 1.189, let's take x=2. f'(2)= 12 +8 –9=11. Positive, so increasing.

So the function increases until x ≈-2.523, then decreases until x≈1.189, then increases again. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: The function is decreasing for x ≥3. Since at x=2, the function is increasing (as f'(2)=11), and beyond x=1.189 it's increasing, so for x≥3, it's definitely increasing. So A is false.

Option D: The function is increasing for x ≥-3. Well, from x=-3 to x≈-2.523, it's increasing, but between -2.523 and 1.189, it's decreasing. So D is false because it's not increasing throughout x≥-3.

Option E: The function is decreasing for x ≤-3. Wait, earlier I found that for x < -2.523 (so x ≤-3 is a subset), the derivative is positive, meaning function is increasing. So E is false because it says decreasing.

Hmm, let me check again. For x < -2.523, f'(x) is positive, so function is increasing. So option E is incorrect.

Now looking at the roots of f(x). Since it's a cubic, it must have at least one real root. Let me try to factor f(x). Maybe using rational root theorem. Possible roots are factors of 18 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±9, ±18.

Testing f(3): 27 + 18 –27 –18 = 0. Oh, so x=3 is a root. Therefore, (x-3) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Dividing f(x) by (x-3):

Using synthetic division:

3 | 1  2  -9  -18
          3  15   18
      1  5   6   0

So f(x) = (x-3)(x² +5x +6). Factorizing the quadratic: x² +5x +6 = (x+2)(x+3). So f(x) = (x-3)(x+2)(x+3). So the roots are x=3, x=-2, x=-3.

So f(x)=0 has three real solutions at x= -3, -2, and 3. So option F is correct (it says three real solutions), and option B is wrong (it says two).

Wait, but let me check if all three are real. Well, the factoring shows three real roots, so yes, F is correct.

So for options B and J: B says two real solutions, J says no real solutions. Both are incorrect because F is correct with three.

Now looking at the other options. Option C: f(x) ≥ –18 for all x ≥0. Let's see. Let's compute f(0): 0 + 0 –0 –18 = -18. So at x=0, f(x)=-18. Then as x increases beyond 0, since the function is increasing (we saw after x≈1.189 it increases), but wait, for x between 0 and 1.189, the function is decreasing because the critical point is around 1.189. Wait, earlier analysis showed that between -2.523 and 1.189, function is decreasing. So from x=0 to x≈1.189, function decreases. So f(0) is -18, but at x just above 0, it would decrease further? Wait, no. Wait, f'(x) is negative between -2.523 and 1.189, so function is decreasing in that interval. So from x=0 to x≈1.189, the function is decreasing. So the minimum in that interval would be at x=1.189.

Wait, let me compute f(1.189). Alternatively, perhaps I can find the minimum value in that interval. Since from x=0 to x≈1.189, function is decreasing, so the minimum would be at x≈1.189. Let me compute f(1): 1 +2 –9 –18 = -24. Hmm, lower than f(0) which was -18. So that suggests that for x=1, f(x)=-24. So at x=1, which is in x≥0, f(x) is -24, which is less than -18. So option C claims f(x)≥–18 for all x≥0, but this is false because at x=1, it's -24. So C is incorrect.

Option G: f(x) ≤–18 for all x ≤0. Let's see. Let's check x=-3: f(-3)= (-3)^3 + 2*(-3)^2 –9*(-3) –18 = -27 + 18 +27 –18 = 0. So at x=-3, f(x)=0, which is greater than -18. So G is false.

Option H: f(x) > –18 for all x <0. Let's see. Let me pick x=-1: f(-1)= -1 + 2 +9 –18= (-1+2)=1; 1+9=10; 10-18=-8. So f(-1)=-8, which is greater than -18. x=-2: f(-2)= (-8) + 8 +18 –18 = (-8+8)=0; 0+18-18=0. So 0>-18. x=-3: f(-3)=0 as before, which is >-18. What about x approaching negative infinity? As x approaches -infty, x^3 dominates, so f(x) approaches -infty. Wait, but that's not possible because our function is a cubic with positive leading coefficient, so as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches -infty. So for very large negative x, f(x) will be less than -18. So option H is false because there are x<0 where f(x) ≤-18.

Option I: f(x) ≤0 for all x ≤–3. Let's see. At x=-3, f(x)=0. For x less than -3, like x=-4: f(-4)= (-64) + 32 + 36 –18 = (-64 +32)= -32; (-32 +36)=4; 4-18=-14. So f(-4)=-14, which is ≤0. Wait, but wait, x=-5: f(-5)= (-125)+50 +45 –18 = (-125 +50)= -75; (-75 +45)= -30; -30-18=-48 ≤0. So maybe I is correct. Hmm, but wait, what about x=-3. Let me double-check. At x=-3, f(x)=0. What about x=-2.5? Wait, no, x=-2.5 is greater than -3, so not considered in option I. Option I says x ≤-3. But wait, perhaps for x approaching negative infinity, f(x) tends to negative infinity? Wait, yes, because leading term is x³, which goes to negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity. So all x ≤-3, f(x) is ≤0? Wait, wait, let's compute another point. x=-3.5: f(-3.5)= (-3.5)^3 + 2*(-3.5)^2 –9*(-3.5) –18.

Calculate each term:

(-3.5)^3 = -42.875
2*(12.25) = 24.5
–9*(-3.5)=31.5
So sum: -42.875 +24.5 = -18.375; +31.5=13.125; 13.125 –18= -4.875. So f(-3.5)= -4.875 ≤0.

Another point: x=-4, we've done, f(x)=-14 ≤0. So maybe option I is correct. Because for x ≤-3, function is ≤0. But wait, wait, x=-3 is the root where f(x)=0. What about x=-2.523, which is a critical point. Wait, no, x=-2.523 is greater than -3, so not in the x ≤-3 region. So in the region x ≤-3, the function is increasing (since f'(x) is positive there), and at x=-3, f(x)=0. So as x decreases below -3, the function's value decreases from 0 to negative infinity. So for all x ≤-3, f(x) ≤0. Therefore, Option I is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The function is increasing for x ≤-2.523, but after x=-3, as x increases towards -2.523, function increases. Wait, no, for x < -2.523 (like x=-3), function is increasing as x increases towards -2.523. So at x=-3, f(x)=0. As x decreases from -3 to -infty, function decreases, so f(x) becomes negative. So yes, for all x ≤-3, f(x) ≤0. So option I is correct.

But wait, I thought option F was correct because f(x)=0 has three real solutions. So I have to check all options to see which are correct.

Looking back, the options are:

A: false.

B: false.

C: false.

D: false.

E: false.

F: true (three solutions).

G: false.

H: false.

I: true.

J: false.

Wait, but the options are from A to J, and the question says "which of the following statements is true". So more than one can be correct? Or just one?

Wait, the options are each individual statements, so I have to check each and see which are true.

But looking at the options, perhaps both F and I are correct. Wait, but let me check. Did I make a mistake with option I?

Wait, when x is less than -3, f(x) is negative, except at x=-3 where it's zero. So for x ≤-3, f(x) ≤0. So I is correct. But wait, the question presents each option as a possible correct statement. So both F and I could be correct, but perhaps only one is among the options.

Wait, let's look at the options:

Options are A through J, each is a statement.

Wait, looking again:

Option F is true (three real solutions).

Option I is also true (f(x) ≤0 for all x ≤-3).

So then, the correct options would be F and I. But the question says "which of the following statements is true", and the options are individual letters. So perhaps more than one is correct, but the way the question is phrased, I need to choose all that are correct. However, the way the options are presented, each is a possible answer, and the user is to select the correct one(s). But the initial question expects a single choice (the user is to reply with a single letter). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate. Let me go through each option again.

Option A: x≥3, function is decreasing. But we saw that for x≥1.189, function is increasing. So A is false.

Option B: f(x)=0 has two real solutions. But it has three, so B is false.

Option C: f(x) ≥-18 for all x≥0. But at x=1, f(x) is -24, which is less than -18. So C is false.

Option D: function is increasing for x≥-3. But between x=-3 and x≈1.189, the function decreases, so D is false.

Option E: function decreasing for x≤-3. No, function is increasing for x < -2.523, which includes x≤-3. So E is false.

Option F: f(x)=0 has three real solutions. Correct.

Option G: f(x) ≤-18 for all x≤0. We saw that at x=-3, f(x)=0 which is greater than -18. So G is false.

Option H: f(x) >-18 for all x<0. Wait, but at x=0, f(x)=-18. For x approaching negative infinity, f(x) approaches -infty, so for some x<0, f(x) is less than -18. So H is false.

Option I: f(x) ≤0 for all x≤-3. Correct, as for x ≤-3, f(x) is 0 or negative.

Option J: f(x)=0 has no real solutions. False, as it has three.

So both F and I are correct. But looking at the options, each is a single statement, so perhaps both F and I are correct, but the options given are A-J, each is a possible answer. But the question might be a multiple-choice where only one option is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option I.

Wait, let me recheck option I. It says f(x) ≤0 for all x ≤-3. Let me pick x=-4: f(-4)= (-64) + 32 +36 –18. Let's compute: (-64 +32)= -32; (-32 +36)=4; 4-18= -14. So yes, f(-4)=-14 ≤0. What about x=-3.5: as before, f(-3.5)=-4.875 ≤0. And x=-3: 0. So yes, all x ≤-3, f(x) ≤0. So I is correct.

Wait, but the initial options provided are A-J, and the problem is to select the correct one. So perhaps both F and I are correct, but the options don't allow for selecting multiple letters. Hmm, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, looking back, the function's behavior for x ≤-3: it's increasing because f'(x) is positive for x < -2.523. So as x increases from -infty to -2.523, function increases. At x=-3, f(x)=0. So for x < -3, function is increasing towards x=-3, but since x is getting more negative, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, when x approaches from the left (more negative than -3), as x increases towards -3, the function increases. So for x < -3, the function is increasing as x approaches -3. But the function's value at x=-3 is 0. So for x < -3, the function's value is less than 0 because as x increases towards -3, function approaches 0 from below. So yes, for x ≤-3, function is ≤0. So option I is correct.

So in this case, both F and I are correct, but looking at the options, each is a separate choice. So perhaps the correct answer is both F and I, but the question expects one choice. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and only F is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the behavior again. Since in the region x ≤-3, the function is increasing as x increases towards -3. So at x=-4, f(x)=-14, and at x=-3, f(x)=0. So as x increases from -4 to -3, f(x) increases from -14 to 0. So for all x ≤-3, f(x) ≤0 because the maximum value in that interval is 0 at x=-3. So I is correct.

Thus, the correct options are F and I. But the problem gives options from A to J, each as a possible answer. So perhaps the answer is both F and I. But since that's not possible, perhaps I made a mistake and only one is correct.

Wait, looking again at the options, option F is "f(x) =0 has three real solutions." That's correct. Option I is "f(x) ≤0 for all x ≤-3." Also correct. So both F and I are true. But the way the question is presented, the user is to select one answer (A-J). So perhaps the correct answer includes both F and I, but that's not an option. Or perhaps the intended answer is F, and I is incorrect. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating I.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the region for x ≤-3. Let me think again: the function is increasing for x < -2.523. So as x increases, f(x) increases. So for x approaching -infty, function approaches -infty, and as x approaches -2.523 from the left, function approaches some value. At x=-3, which is less than -2.523, f(x)=0. So as x increases from -infty to -3
