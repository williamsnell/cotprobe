Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about lenses. Hmm, let me try to remember what I learned about concave and convex lenses and their focal lengths. 

The problem says there's a concave lens with a focal length of 12 cm placed in contact with a convex lens of 7.5 cm. I need to find the refracting power of the combination. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, refracting power is related to the focal length. Oh right, refracting power is the reciprocal of the focal length, measured in meters. So diopter is 1 divided by the focal length in meters.

But wait, wait. Concave and convex lenses have different signs for their focal lengths. I think convex lenses are positive because they cause light to converge, while concave lenses are negative because they diverge light. So the sign matters here.

So the formula for the combined focal length when two lenses are in contact is 1/f_total = 1/f1 + 1/f2. But wait, since one is concave and the other convex, their signs will be opposite.

Let me get this straight. The concave lens has a focal length of 12 cm. Concave is negative, so f1 is -12 cm. The convex lens has a focal length of 7.5 cm, which is positive, so f2 is +7.5 cm.

Wait, no, wait another thing. Wait, I might be mixing things up. Focal length for concave lenses is considered negative because they diverge light. So yeah, f1 is -12 cm, f2 is +7.5 cm.

But wait, I've heard that when lenses are combined, their focal lengths add, but with signs. So the combined focal length would be calculated using 1/f_total = 1/f1 + 1/f2.

So let me compute that. Let's convert cm to meters first, but maybe it's easier to compute in cm and then convert to diopters at the end.

So f1 is -12 cm, f2 is +7.5 cm.

So 1/f1 is 1/(-12) cm^-1, and 1/f2 is 1/(7.5) cm^-1.

Adding them together: 1/f_total = (1/-12) + (1/7.5) = (-1/12) + (1/7.5)

Let me calculate that. What's -1/12 plus 1/7.5?

Hmm. Let's find a common denominator. 12 and 7.5. Let's see, 7.5 is 15/2, so maybe 30? Let me convert them:

-1/12 = -2.5/30 (because 12*2.5=30, so multiply numerator and denominator by 2.5)

1/7.5 is same as 2/15, which is 4/30 (since 15*2=30, so multiply numerator by 2 and denominator by 2).

So -2.5/30 +4/30 = (4-2.5)/30 = 1.5/30 = 0.05.

So 1/f_total = 0.05 cm^-1. So f_total = 1/0.05 cm = 20 cm.

Wait, 0.05 is 1/20, so 1/0.05 is 20. So f_total is 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters.

But wait, what's the sign? Because when you add -1/12 and 1/7.5, you get positive. So 1/f_total is positive, meaning f_total is positive. So the combination is a convex lens because it has a positive focal length.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic.

So let's compute -1/12 + 1/7.5 again. Let's convert them to decimal. 

1/12 is approximately 0.083333..., so -1/12 is -0.083333. 1/7.5 is 0.133333... So adding them: -0.083333 + 0.133333 = 0.05. So yes, that's correct. So 1/f_total is 0.05 cm^-1, so f_total is 20 cm. That's 0.2 meters.

So the combined focal length is 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters. So the refracting power is 1/f, which is 1/0.2 meters = 5 diopters. Wait, but wait, the focal length is positive, so the power is positive. So the refracting power is +5 diopters.

Looking at the options, option D is -5 diopters, which is negative. Option G is 4.5, E is 8, so none of them are 5. Wait, did I do something wrong?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the signs. Let me think again. The concave lens has a negative focal length, so f1 is -12 cm. The convex lens has f2=+7.5 cm. So adding their reciprocals:

1/f_total = (1/-12) + (1/7.5) = (-0.083333) + (0.133333) = 0.05. So 1/f_total is 0.05 cm^-1 → f_total is 20 cm.

So that's correct. So the focal length is positive 20 cm, so the power is positive 5 diopters. But looking at the options, there's no +5. Hmm. Let's see the options again.

Options are:

A: -7.5

B: 19.5

C:12

D: -5

E:8

F:-12

G:4.5

H:-3

I: -19.5

J:0

Wait, none of the options is +5. So maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me try another approach.

Wait, maybe I confused the formula. Alternatively, when two lenses are in contact, their powers add. Because power is 1/f, so P_total = P1 + P2.

Ah, that's a simpler approach. Because the formula for combined power is just the sum of individual powers.

So, let me think. The focal length of the concave lens is -12 cm, so its power is 1/(-0.12 m) = -8.333... diopters.

The convex lens has focal length 7.5 cm, so 0.075 m. So its power is 1/0.075 ≈ 13.333... diopters.

So P_total = (-8.333) + (13.333) = 5 diopters.

So again, 5 diopters. But the options don't have +5. So I must have made a mistake. Wait, but the options do have option D as -5.

Wait, but my calculation says positive. What's going on here?

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the sign for the concave lens. Wait, another thought: some sources consider concave lenses to have positive focal lengths when used as diverging. Wait, no, I'm pretty sure concave lenses have negative focal lengths because they diverge light. Convex have positive because they converge.

Wait, let me confirm with the formula. The power of a lens is 1/f in meters, with sign according to the type of lens. So, convex lenses have positive power, concave have negative.

So in this problem, concave lens f = -12 cm → -0.12 m. So power is 1/(-0.12) ≈ -8.333 diopters.

Convex lens f = +7.5 cm → 0.075 m. Power is 1/0.075 ≈13.333 diopters.

Adding them: -8.333 +13.333 = 5 diopters. So the combined power is +5 D.

But the options don't have +5. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, maybe I swapped the focal lengths. Let me read the problem again: the concave lens has focal length 12 cm, convex 7.5 cm.

So the concave is f1 = -12 cm, convex f2 = +7.5 cm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the focal length of the concave lens is positive because the problem gives it as 12 cm? No, no. The sign is determined by whether it's concave or convex. So the problem says concave, so f is negative.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different when lenses are in contact. I thought that when two lenses are in contact, their focal lengths are effectively additive for power, but perhaps there's another consideration. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's compute the combined focal length using 1/f_total = 1/f1 + 1/f2.

f1 = -12 cm → -0.12 m. So 1/f1 = -8.333 diopters.

f2 = 7.5 cm →0.075 m →1/f2=13.333 diopters.

So adding, 1/f_total = (-8.333) +13.333=5 diopters → f_total=0.2 m=20 cm.

So again, same result. So power is +5 D.

But the options don't have +5. Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is -5 diopters. But I'm getting positive. So did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Another approach: when two lenses are placed in contact, the combined focal length is given by 1/f = 1/f1 + 1/f2, but with their signs.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is 1/f = 1/f1 + 1/f2, where f1 and f2 are in meters, with correct signs.

So let me compute again with meters.

f1 = -0.12 m → 1/f1 = -8.333 diopters.

f2 = 0.075 m →1/f2 =13.333 diopters.

So 1/f_total = (-8.333) + (13.333) =5 → f_total=0.2 m → 20 cm.

So the combined power is 5 diopters. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the refracting power, which is the same as the power. So I get +5 D, but the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should have taken the concave lens as positive. No, that can't be right. Concave lenses have negative focal lengths. Unless the problem gives the focal length as positive, but in reality, concave lenses have negative focal lengths.

Wait, the problem says the concave lens has focal length 12 cm. So that's the absolute value, but the sign is negative because it's concave. So f1 is -12 cm. Similarly, the convex is +7.5 cm.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but that's impossible. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options go up to J. Let me list them:

A: -7.5

B:19.5

C:12

D:-5

E:8

F:-12

G:4.5

H:-3

I:-19.5

J:0

So no +5. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is that the lenses are placed in contact, but the formula is different. Wait, no. The formula 1/f_total = 1/f1 + 1/f2 is correct for thin lenses in contact.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the focal length is measured differently. Let me try using cm instead of meters.

So f1 = -12 cm, so 1/f1 = -1/12 cm^-1.

f2=7.5 cm →1/f2=1/7.5 cm^-1.

So 1/f_total = (-1/12) + (1/7.5) = let's compute this in cm.

Compute (-1/12) + (1/7.5) = ?

1/7.5 is 2/15, which is approximately 0.1333...

1/12 is approximately 0.0833, so negative is -0.0833.

Adding: -0.0833 +0.1333= 0.05 cm^-1.

So 1/f_total=0.05 cm^-1 → f_total=20 cm. Which is 0.2 m.

So diopter is 1/f in meters → 1/(0.2)=5 D.

So again, 5 D. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the focal length is negative? Because when the combined focal length is positive, the lens is convex, but perhaps the question wants the power to be negative. No, that's not right. Power is positive for convex.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is different. For two lenses in contact, the formula is 1/f = 1/f1 + 1/f2. But perhaps I should have added the focal lengths as fractions in meters.

Wait, let's compute it in meters.

f1 = -0.12 m → 1/f1 = -8.333 D.

f2=0.075 m →1/f2=13.333 D.

Sum: -8.333 +13.333=5 D.

Hmm, same result.

So perhaps the correct answer is 5 D, but it's not among the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says the concave lens is placed in contact with the convex lens. Oh wait, maybe I swapped the order. Wait, no, the order doesn't matter because addition is commutative. So 1/f1 +1/f2 is same regardless of order.

Wait, maybe I should have used the other formula, like for magnification or something else. No, the question is about refracting power, which is the same as optical power, which is the sum of the individual powers.

Wait, let me check the options again. Oh wait, option E is 8 diopters. Did I miscalculate? Let me compute the individual powers again.

Concave lens: f = -12 cm = -0.12 m. Power is 1/-0.12 = -8.333 D.

Convex lens: f=7.5 cm=0.075 m. Power is 1/0.075≈13.333 D.

Sum: -8.333 +13.333=5 D.

So it's 5, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, or I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong sign for the convex lens. No, convex should be positive. Wait, perhaps the convex lens has a negative power? No, that's wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with the reciprocal. Let me compute 1/7.5 cm. Wait, 7.5 cm is 0.075 m. So 1/0.075 is approximately 13.333 D. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for something else. Oh wait, the question asks for the refracting power of the combination, which is the same as the combined power, so 5 D. But since that's not an option, I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute using a different approach. Let me compute the focal length in cm again.

f1 = -12 cm, f2=7.5 cm.

So 1/f_total = (1/-12) + (1/7.5) = (-1/12) + (2/15) → let's find a common denominator, which is 60.

-1/12 = -5/60, 2/15=8/60.

So sum is (-5 +8)/60=3/60=1/20.

So 1/f_total=1/20 cm^{-1} → f_total=20 cm.

So 20 cm is 0.2 m. Power is 1/0.2=5 D.

Again, same result. So I'm confident that the answer should be 5 D. But since it's not an option, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers the concave lens as positive. Let's try that. Suppose f1=+12 cm (wrong, but just to see).

Then 1/f1=1/12 cm^-1, 1/f2=1/7.5 cm^-1.

Sum: 1/12 +1/7.5 = (7.5 +12)/(12*7.5) =19.5/90=0.21666... cm^{-1}.

So f_total= approx 4.615 cm. Which is 0.04615 m. Power is 1/0.04615≈21.67 D. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, if the convex is negative, which would be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem swapped the focal lengths. Let me try with f1=12 cm (assuming it's convex) and f2=-7.5 cm (as concave).

So 1/f_total =1/12 +1/(-7.5)= (1/12) - (1/7.5).

1/12≈0.0833, 1/7.5≈0.1333.

So 0.0833 -0.1333= -0.05 → 1/f_total= -0.05 cm^{-1} → f_total= -20 cm.

Then power is 1/(-0.2 m)= -5 D. So that would match option D: -5 diopters.

Ah, so perhaps I swapped the signs. So the correct approach is f1 is -12 cm (concave) and f2=+7.5 cm (convex). But if I mistakenly took f1 as positive and f2 as negative, I would get -5 D.

Wait, but the problem states that the concave has 12 cm, so f1 must be -12. Convex has 7.5, so f2=+7.5.

But in this case, the result is +5 D, which isn't an option. Unless the problem expects the focal length to be treated as positive for the concave, which would be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask for the focal length, but that doesn't make sense. The question is about refracting
