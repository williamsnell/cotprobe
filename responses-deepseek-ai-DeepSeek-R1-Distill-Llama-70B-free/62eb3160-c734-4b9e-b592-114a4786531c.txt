Okay, so I've got this question about a steel helical spring and its fundamental frequency under two different conditions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the spring has an index of 10 and 12 active coils. The wire is oil-tempered number 7 gauge. I remember that the index is the ratio of the coil diameter to the wire diameter, so index = D/d = 10. That means if the wire diameter is d, the diameter of each coil is 10d.

Wait, but I don't know the actual diameter of the wire. Oh, right, the wire is number 7 gauge. I think the gauge number relates to the diameter. I remember there's a standard for wire gauges, like the American Wire Gauge (AWG). Let me try to recall the diameters. I think for steel, number 7 gauge is about 0.177 inches? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, I think the formula for wire diameter in AWG is d = 0.457 * 92^((36 - n)/39), where n is the gauge number. Let me calculate that for n=7.

So n=7. So 36-7 is 29. 29 divided by 39 is about 0.7436. 92 raised to that power. Wait, 92^0.7436. Hmm, that's a bit tricky without a calculator. Alternatively, I might remember that 7 gauge is approximately 0.177 inches in diameter. Let me double-check that number. Wait, I think I might be confusing it with another gauge. Alternatively, perhaps 7 gauge is 0.177 inches, 6 is 0.203, 8 is 0.162, etc. I'll go with d=0.177 inches for now.

So the coil diameter D is 10*d = 10 * 0.177 = 1.77 inches. Hmm, okay. Now, the number of active coils is 12.

The question is about the fundamental frequency for two cases: one end fixed and the other free, and both ends fixed. I remember that the fundamental frequency depends on the support conditions. For a spring, it's similar to a beam, I think. When one end is fixed and the other is free, it's like a cantilever beam, and when both ends are fixed, it's like a clamped-clamped beam.

Wait, but wait, the formula for natural frequency of a spring. Oh right, the formula for the natural frequency (fn) in Hz (cycles per second) is given by fn = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m), where k is the spring constant and m is the mass. But wait, for a helical spring, the effective mass m is related to the mass of the spring.

Wait, the mass of the spring is the volume times density. The volume of the spring is the volume of the wire, which is the area of the wire cross-section times the length of the wire. The wire is wound into a helix, so the length of the wire (L) is the number of coils (n) times the average circumference, which is πD times n. Wait, no, wait. The length of the wire is the number of coils multiplied by the circumference of each coil. So L = n * π D. But wait, n is the number of active coils, which is 12 in this case. So L = 12 * π * D. Since D is 1.77 inches, L = 12 * π * 1.77.

But wait, no, the wire is a helix, so the length of the wire is approximately the number of coils times the average circumference per coil. So each coil's circumference is πD, so L = n * π D. So for n=12, D=1.77 inches, L=12 * π * 1.77. Let me compute that.

12 * 3.1416 * 1.77 ≈ 12 * 5.56 ≈ 66.72 inches. Hmm, that's the length of the wire.

The cross-sectional area of the wire is A = π (d/2)^2. Since d=0.177 inches, A = π*(0.0885)^2 ≈ π*0.00783 ≈ 0.0246 square inches.

So the volume of the wire is A * L = 0.0246 * 66.72 ≈ 1.642 in³.

The specific weight (density) is given as y = 0.285 lb/in³. So the mass m is y * volume = 0.285 * 1.642 ≈ 0.468 lb. Wait, but wait, mass is in slugs, right? Because in the English system, weight is in lb, mass is in slugs. Oh, but I might be mixing up. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the weight to mass.

Wait, specific weight is weight per unit volume, so y = 0.285 lb/in³. So weight W = y * V = 0.285 * 1.642 ≈ 0.468 lb. Then mass m = W / g, where g is 386 in/s². So m = 0.468 / 386 ≈ 0.001212 slugs.

Alternatively, sometimes people use lb-mass, but I think in this context, it's better to stick with slugs for consistency in the formula.

Now, the spring constant k for a helical spring is given by k = (G * d^4) / (8 * n * D^3) ). Wait, no, more accurately, k = (G * d^4) / (8 * n * D^3 * i), where i is the number of active coils? Or wait, the formula I remember is k = (G * d^4) / (8 * n * D^3), where n is the number of active coils. Wait, let me double-check. Oh, right, the formula for the spring rate is k = (G * d^4) / (8 * n * D^3). So G is modulus of rigidity, which is given as 11.5e6 lb/in².

So plugging in the numbers: G=11.5e6, d=0.177, D=1.77, n=12.

Calculating numerator: G*d^4 = 11.5e6 * (0.177)^4.

Let me compute (0.177)^4. 0.177^2 = 0.0313, so 0.0313^2 ≈ 0.00098.

So 11.5e6 * 0.00098 ≈ 11.5e6 * 0.00098 = 11270 lb/in² * in^4? Wait, units might not track, but perhaps we'll get to that.

Denominator: 8 * n * D^3 = 8 * 12 * (1.77)^3.

1.77^3 is approx 1.77 * 1.77 = 3.1329, then *1.77: 3.1329 *1.77 ≈ 5.545 in³.

So denominator: 8 * 12 * 5.545 = 96 * 5.545 ≈ 532.32 in³.

So k = numerator / denominator = 11270 / 532.32 ≈ 21.17 lb/in.

Wait, that seems low. Let me check the calculations again. Maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, 0.177^4: 0.177^2 is 0.0313, then squared again: 0.0313^2 = 0.00098, correct. So 11.5e6 * 0.00098 = 11.5e6 * 9.8e-4 = approx 11.5 *9.8 *1e2 = 112.7e2 = 11270 lb/in² * in^4? Wait, units might need checking, but perhaps the units will work out.

Wait, modulus of rigidity G is in lb/in², d is in inches, so d^4 is in^4. So numerator is G*d^4 → (lb/in²) * in^4 = lb*in².

Denominator: 8 is unitless, n is 12, D^3 is in^3. So denominator is in^3.

So overall, k has units (lb*in²) / in^3 = lb/in. Which is correct, since spring constant is in lb per in.

So k≈21.17 lb/in.

Wait, that seems a bit low, but perhaps it's correct. Let me think, for a steel spring, that's a moderate rate.

Now, the natural frequency for the two cases. Let's start with case (1): one end fixed, one end free.

Wait, the formula for natural frequency for a spring is fn = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m). But wait, that's for a simple mass-spring system, where m is the mass attached to the spring. But in this case, the spring's own mass is considered, so the formula might be a bit different.

Wait, I think when considering the spring's own mass, the effective mass (or the equivalent mass) comes into play. For a spring with distributed mass, the effective mass for the fundamental mode depends on the boundary conditions.

Wait, for a beam or a rod, the natural frequency is given by different formulas depending on the supports. For a cantilever beam (fixed-free), the natural frequency is (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (3EI)/(m L^3) ), where m is mass per unit length. Hmm, but I'm not sure if this applies directly to a spring.

Alternatively, for a spring treated as a rod, the natural frequency when one end is fixed and the other is free would be based on the formula for a fixed-free rod, which is fn = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (EI)/(m L^3) ) * some mode shape factor.

Wait, but maybe I should model the spring as a rod and use the appropriate formulas. The general formula for the natural frequency of a beam in bending is:

fn = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (EI)/(m L^3) ) * (some factor based on boundary conditions)

For fixed-free, the factor is sqrt(3), so fn = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (3 EI) / (m L^3) )

Similarly, for fixed-fixed, the factor is higher, maybe sqrt( (7.85)^2 ) for the first mode, but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, but for a helical spring, which is essentially a torsion spring when considering its primary function, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for longitudinal vibration applies, but I think the problem is treating it as a transverse vibration, which would be like a beam.

Wait, but in this problem, the spring is being considered for its natural frequency in bending, I think, so it's treated as a beam. So the formula would depend on whether the ends are fixed or free.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on whether to model it as a beam or as a simple spring-mass system. Maybe I should consider the spring as a beam with distributed mass and use the beam's natural frequency formula.

So, for a fixed-free beam, the first natural frequency is given by:

fn = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (3 EI ) / (m L^3) )

Where E is the modulus of elasticity, I is the moment of inertia, m is mass per unit length, L is length.

Wait, no, actually, it's:

The general formula for natural frequency is:

fn = (β^2 / (2π)) * sqrt( EI / (m L^4) )

Where β is a factor depending on boundary conditions. For a fixed-free beam, β is sqrt(3) * (1) for the first mode. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, another approach: The formula for the natural frequency of a cantilever beam (fixed-free) is:

fn = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (3EI)/(m L^3) )

Similarly, for a fixed-fixed beam, the formula is:

fn = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (7.85)^2 EI / (m L^3) )

But wait, 7.85 is the first mode eigenvalue for fixed-fixed ends. So the formula is:

fn = (7.85^2)/(2π) * sqrt( EI/(m L^3) )

Wait, but 7.85 is the value of β, so the formula becomes fn = β^2/(2π) * sqrt(EI/(m L^4)), but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the spring as a rod in axial vibration, but that's probably not the case. Since the question is about the fundamental frequency, and the spring is helical, I think it's more about transverse vibration, so the beam approach applies.

But wait, the modulus of rigidity G is given, which is the shear modulus, so perhaps it's a torsional vibration problem. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, actually, the modulus of rigidity, G, is relevant for torsional deformations. So for a helical spring, when you apply a torque, it twists. So perhaps the natural frequency in torsion is what's being considered here.

Wait, but the question is about the fundamental frequency when the ends are fixed or free. So maybe it's about the torsional natural frequency.

If that's the case, then the formula for the natural frequency in torsion is:

fn = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (GJ)/(I L) )

Where J is the polar moment of inertia, I is the moment of inertia of the cross-section, and L is the length.

Wait, no, more accurately, for a rod in torsion, the natural frequency is given by:

fn = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (GJ)/(m L) )

Where J is the polar moment of inertia per unit length, and m is the mass per unit length.

Wait, but I might need to think again. The general wave equation for torsion is similar to that for bending. The speed of torsional waves is sqrt(GJ/ρ I), where I is the polar moment of inertia.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the natural frequency of a rod in torsion:

fn = (β/(2π)) * sqrt( (G J)/(ρ I L^2) )

Where β is a factor depending on the boundary conditions.

For a fixed-free rod in torsion (one end fixed, the other free), the first mode β is π/2. For a fixed-fixed rod, β is π.

Wait, let me check that. In torsion, the boundary conditions affect the eigenvalues. For fixed-free, the eigenvalue is (nπ/2), where n is the mode number. So for the first mode, β = π/2. For fixed-fixed, β = π.

So the natural frequency would be:

fn = (β/(2π)) * sqrt( (G J)/(ρ I L^2) )

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Alternatively, another approach is to model it as a rod with distributed mass.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again about the spring's properties.

The spring has n=12 coils, wire diameter d=0.177 inches, D=1.77 inches. The modulus of rigidity G=11.5e6 lb/in².

Wait, the formula for natural frequency for a spring is sometimes given as:

fn = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m)

But that's for a lumped mass system, where m is the attached mass. In this case, the spring's own mass is being considered, so perhaps the formula involves the mass of the spring.

Wait, but earlier I calculated the mass of the spring as approximately 0.468 lb (weight), which is 0.001212 slugs (mass). Wait, that's correct because mass m = weight W / g.

Wait, but if I use this m in the formula fn = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m), then m is 0.001212 slugs. Let me plug in the numbers.

k was calculated as approximately 21.17 lb/in.

So sqrt(k/m) = sqrt(21.17 / 0.001212) = sqrt(21.17 / 0.001212) ≈ sqrt(17465) ≈ 132.2 rad/s.

Then, 1/(2π) times that is about 132.2 / 6.283 ≈ 21.04 Hz. Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are in the 28-37 Hz range.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me recheck that.

The formula for the spring rate k is (G d^4)/(8 n D^3).

G is 11.5e6 lb/in².

d = 0.177 inches.

n=12 coils.

D=10*d = 1.77 inches.

So let's compute each part step by step.

Calculate d^4: (0.177)^4.

0.177^2 = 0.031329.

Then, (0.031329)^2 = approximately 0.000980.

So G*d^4 = 11.5e6 * 0.000980 = 11.5e6 * 0.000980 = 11.5 * 980 = 11270 lb/in² * in^4? Wait, no, units need to be consistent. Wait, G is in lb/in², d is in inches, so d^4 is in^4. So G*d^4 is lb/in² * in^4 = lb·in².

Denominator: 8 * n * D^3.

Compute D^3: (1.77)^3.

1.77 * 1.77 = 3.1329; 3.1329 * 1.77 ≈ 5.545 in³.

So denominator is 8 * 12 * 5.545 = 8*12=96; 96*5.545≈532.32 in³.

So k = 11270 / 532.32 ≈ 21.17 lb/in. That's what I had before.

Wait, but then using that in the formula gives a frequency of about 21 Hz, but the options are higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mass. Let's recheck that.

Volume of wire: length L = n * π D = 12 * π * 1.77 ≈ 12 * 5.556 ≈ 66.67 inches.

Area A = π*(d/2)^2 = π*(0.0885)^2 ≈ 0.0246 in².

Volume
