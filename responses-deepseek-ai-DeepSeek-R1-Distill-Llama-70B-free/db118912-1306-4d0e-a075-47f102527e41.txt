Question:

The STANDARD SCORES express raw score distance from mean by SD and considered the most satisfactory type of NR score. Which statement out of the following ones is about T-scores?

Options:

A: M=0, SD=1, often used in research studies
B: M=100, SD=15 or 16
C: They express raw scores in terms of percentiles
D: M=500, SD=100, often used in college entrance exams
E: Shows how many standard deviations a score is above or below the mean: a score of +1.0 means itâ€™s 1 SD above the mean
F: M=100, SD=10, commonly used in IQ tests
G: M=100, SD=24, typically used in personality assessments
H: M=50, SD=10- it is used on many psychological tests, MMPI
I: They express raw scores in terms of ranks
J: standard nine: M=5, SD=approx 2

Okay, so I need to figure out which statement is about T-scores. The question gives me several options, from A to J, each describing different types of scores. I remember that standard scores are a way to express raw scores in terms of their distance from the mean, measured in standard deviations. T-scores are a type of standard score, right?

Wait, I think T-scores have a specific mean and standard deviation. I recall that Z-scores have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. But the question is about T-scores, so I'm a bit confused because sometimes people mix them up. Or maybe T-scores are another name for standard scores with different parameters.

Looking at the options:

Option A: M=0, SD=1. That sounds like Z-scores, not T-scores. So A is probably about Z-scores.

Option B: M=100, SD=15 or 16. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I think some tests use a mean of 100 with SD around 15, like maybe IQ tests or certain standardized tests.

Option C: They express raw scores as percentiles. No, that's percentile ranks, not standard scores. So C is not about T-scores.

Option D: M=500, SD=100. That rings a bell; maybe SAT scores? But I'm not sure if that's T-scores or just another kind of scaled score.

Option E: Explains how many SDs from the mean. That's the definition of standard scores like Z, but the example is a +1.0 being 1 SD above. So E describes Z-scores, perhaps.

Option F: M=100, SD=10, used in IQ tests. I'm pretty sure IQ tests often use a mean of 100 with an SD of 15, so F might not be correct.

Option G: M=100, SD=24 for personality tests. Not sure, but I thought personality assessments use different scoring methods, maybe not T-scores.

Option H: M=50, SD=10, used on MMPI. I remember MMPI uses a different scaling, perhaps T-scores where the mean is 50 and SD is 10. Oh wait, yes, T-scores are sometimes set with a mean of 50 and SD of about 10, so this might be T-scores.

Option I: Expresses raw scores as ranks. That's not standard scores, so I is out.

Option J: Standard nine, M=5, SD=2. Not sure what that's about, maybe a different system.

Wait, the question says that standard scores express raw scores in terms of SDs from the mean. So the correct answer should have a specific mean and SD. T-scores, as I recall, are often used in certain psychological tests. I think in MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory), T-scores are used with a mean of 50 and SD of 10. So looking at the options, option H says M=50, SD=10, used on many psychological tests, MMPI included. So that must be T-scores.

So the statement about T-scores is option H.

The correct answer is H because T-scores are often used in psychological assessments like the MMPI, where the mean is 50 and the standard deviation is 10.
