Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about issues management and crisis management. I'm a bit rusty on these topics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking which statement is NOT true about both. That means I need to find the option that doesn't apply to either or doesn't apply to at least one of them.

First, I should recall what each term means. Issues management, as I remember, is about identifying and managing issues that could affect an organization. It's more proactive, trying to prevent problems before they escalate. Crisis management, on the other hand, is about handling full-blown crises, which are more severe and immediate.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: They both are reactive approaches. Wait, no. Issues management is proactive, right? It's about anticipating issues before they become crises. So if this option says both are reactive, that's not true because issues management is proactive. So this might be the answer, but I should check the others.

Option B: Both can damage reputation. That makes sense. Issues, if not managed, can become crises, and crises definitely harm reputation. So B is true for both, so it's not the answer.

Option C: Deal with acute risks. Issues are more ongoing or emerging, while crises are acute. So maybe C is not true for both. Or wait, maybe in issues management, they deal with potential risks that could become acute. Hmm, I'm not sure. I'll come back to this.

Option D: New practices developed. I think both might lead to changes. After a crisis, organizations often adopt new practices, and issues management might lead to new strategies to prevent issues. So D is true for both, not the answer.

Option E: Swift response time. Crises definitely require quick responses. Issues management might not always need to be as swift, but maybe sometimes. Wait, or is it that issues management is more about monitoring and planning, not necessarily immediate response? So maybe E is not true for both. But I'm not certain.

Option F: Both can lead to improvement. Yes, dealing with issues can lead to better practices, and crises often trigger changes. So F is true for both.

Option G: Require research monitoring. Issues management definitely involves monitoring. Crises management might involve some monitoring during the response, but perhaps not as much as issues management. Or maybe both require it. I'm not sure.

Option H: Both are planned in advance. Issues management plans are proactive, while crisis management also has plans in place. So H is true for both.

Option I: Require change in structure. Not sure. Maybe some crises lead to structural changes, but not always. Issues management might not require structural changes unless the issue is significant. So I might not be universally true for both.

Wait, going back to the options. The question asks which is NOT true of both. So I'm looking for the statement that doesn't apply to either.

Option A says both are reactive. But issues management is proactive, so A is false for issues management. Therefore, A is the statement that's NOT true of both.

Wait, but let me double-check the other options. Option C: They both deal with acute risks. Issues management deals with potential or emerging issues, which may not be acute yet. Crises are acute. So C is not true for issues management. So C would be a statement that's not true about both, making it a possible answer.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT true about both. So if the statement is not true for at least one, then it's the answer.

So, let's think again.

Option A: Both reactive. Issues management is proactive. So A is false for issues management, meaning it's not true that both are reactive. So A is the answer.

But then what about option C? Are both dealing with acute risks? Issues management is about potential risks that may or may not be acute. Crises are acute. So C is not true for both.

Wait, the question is which statement is NOT true of both. So if a statement is not true for either, it's the answer.

So both A and C could be candidates. Let me see the options again.

Wait, the options are about which is NOT true of both. So if an option is false for at least one, it's the correct answer.

So, for A, issues management is proactive, so A is false. So A is the answer.

But let me think about the other options in case I'm missing something.

Option E: Both require swift response. Crises do, but issues management might not need as swift a response. So E's statement isn't true for both. So E could be another candidate.

Wait, but I thought A was the answer. Hmm.

Wait, the question is which is NOT true of both. So the statement that is false for at least one of them.

So, let's go through each option.

A: They both are reactive. Issues management is proactive. So A is false for issues management. So A is a statement that's not true about both. So A is the answer.

But let's check the others. What about E? For example, issues management might not require a swift response because they're dealing with emerging issues, which can be managed over time. So E is not true for both. So E would also be a possible answer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up some notes.

Issues management: proactive, identifies potential issues before they become crises, involves monitoring and planning.

Crisis management: reactive, deals with immediate threats, requires quick action.

So, looking at the options again.

Option A: Both reactive. Issues management is proactive, so A is false. So A is the answer.

Option E: Both require swift response. Crisis does, but issues management doesn't necessarily. So E is also false about both, making E another possible answer.

Wait, but the question asks which is NOT true of both. So if an option is not true for either, then it's the answer.

So, I have to find the option that is not true for both. So if one is true for one and false for the other, it's the answer.

So let's go through each option.

A: Both reactive: No, issues management is proactive. So A is false.

B: Both can damage reputation: True for both.

C: Both deal with acute risks: Issues management deals with potential, not acute. Crisis deals with acute. So C is false for issues management.

D: New practices: True for both.

E: Require swift response: Crisis yes, issues management may not. So E is false for issues management.

F: Both can lead to improvement: True.

G: Both require research monitoring: Issues management requires monitoring. Crisis management might involve some during the response, but perhaps not as much beforehand. Not sure.

H: Both planned in advance: Issues management is planned, and crisis management has plans. So H is true.

I: Both require structural change: Not necessarily. So I might not be true for both.

So now, the options that are false for at least one are A, C, E, G, I.

The question is which statement is NOT true of both. So the correct answer is the one that is not applicable to both.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT true about both. So the statement that doesn't apply to either.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of which statement is true for both. The question is asking for the one that is NOT true for both.

So, for example, if a statement is true for one and false for the other, it's the answer.

So, let's re-examine each option.

Option A: Both are reactive. Issues management is proactive, so A is false for issues management. So A is a statement that is not true for both.

Option C: Both deal with acute risks. Crisis management deals with acute, issues management with potential, so C is false for issues management.

Option E: Both require swift response. Crisis yes, issues management no, so E is false for issues management.

So, the question is which of these is NOT true about both. So all of A, C, E, etc., are candidates.

But the answer options are A to J.

Looking back at the original question, the correct answer is the one that is not true for both. So which of these options is not true for both.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A because issues management is proactive, making A false.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about each option.

Option H: Both are planned in advance. Issues management is planned, and crisis management has plans. So H is true for both. So H is not the answer.

Option G: Both require research monitoring. Issues management does, but does crisis management? Maybe during the crisis, but perhaps not as much as in issues management. So maybe G is not true for both. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A because it's clearly not true for issues management.

Wait, but looking for the option that is NOT true for both. So the statement that is false for at least one of them.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A. Because issues management is proactive, so A is false for issues management. So A is the statement that is NOT true for both.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought E might also be a candidate.

Wait, the question is about which statement is NOT true of both. So if the statement is true for one and false for the other, it's the answer.

So, looking for the statement that is false for either.

In that case, multiple options could be correct, but the question gives only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the definitions again.

Issues management is proactive, aiming to prevent crises. It involves identifying and managing issues before they escalate.

Crisis management is reactive, dealing with the crisis once it occurs.

So, looking at the options:

A: Both are reactive. No, because issues management is proactive. So A is false.

E: Both require swift response. Crisis yes, issues management may not. So E is false for issues management.

So both A and E are false for issues management.

But the question is which is NOT true about both. So which option is a statement that applies to neither, or at least one.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A because it's a clear opposite for issues management.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E because swift response isn't a requirement for issues management.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for the option that is not applicable to either, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A because issues management is proactive.

So in that case, the statement that is NOT true for both is A, because issues management is not reactive.

So the answer is A.

To determine which statement is NOT true of both issues management and crisis management, we analyze each option based on the definitions and characteristics of these two concepts:

- **Issues Management**: Proactive in nature, focusing on identifying and managing potential issues before they escalate into crises. It involves monitoring, planning, and strategic interventions to prevent or mitigate risks.

- **Crisis Management**: Reactive, dealing with acute threats or events that have already occurred. It requires immediate action to address the crisis and minimize harm.

### Analysis of Each Option:

**A: They both are reactive approaches to handle issues.**  
This is false for issues management, as it is proactive, aiming to prevent issues before they escalate. Therefore, this statement is NOT true for both.

**B: Both have the potential to damage an organisation's reputation.**  
This is true for both. Poorly managed issues or crises can harm an organization's reputation.

**C: They both deal with acute risks.**  
This is false for issues management, as it deals with potential or emerging risks, not acute ones. Crises, however, involve acute risks. Thus, this statement is NOT true for both.

**D: New organizational practices are developed as a result of each.**  
This is true for both. Both issues management and crisis management can lead to changes in organizational practices.

**E: Both require a swift response time.**  
This is false for issues management, as it does not necessarily require immediate action. Crises, however, do require swift responses. Thus, this statement is NOT true for both.

**F: Both can lead to improvement in organizational practices.**  
This is true for both. Addressing issues or crises can result in organizational improvements.

**G: They both require research monitoring.**  
This is true for both. Issues management involves monitoring potential risks, and crisis management may involve monitoring during and after the crisis.

**H: Both are planned in advance and implemented when needed.**  
This is true for both. Issues management involves proactive planning, and crisis management relies on pre-established plans.

**I: Both require a change in organizational structure.**  
This is not necessarily true for both. While some crises or issues may lead to structural changes, it is not a universal requirement.

### Conclusion:
The question asks for the statement that is NOT true of both. Based on the analysis, **Option A** is the best answer because issues management is proactive, not reactive. While other options like **C** and **E** are also false for issues management, **A** is the most straightforward and clear example of a statement that is NOT true for both.
