Question:

A man suffered frostbite when he spilled a soft drink on his lap that he had purchased from a restaurant. The man sued the restaurant for negligence and damages. At trial, the man's attorney calls a witness to testify that the witness also suffered frostbite when she spilled a soft drink in her lap that she had purchased at the restaurant two weeks earlier. The witness also states that she told the restaurant about her injury immediately after suffering it. Upon objection by the restaurant's attorney, the trial judge should rule the witness's testimony

Options:

A: admissible, but only to prove the restaurant's negligence and not for any claims of damages.
B: inadmissible, as it is an unrelated incident and does not prove the restaurant's negligence in the man's case.
C: admissible, as it is a similar occurrence and can prove a pattern of negligence by the restaurant.
D: inadmissible, as it is hearsay and not directly related to the man's case.
E: admissible to prove that the restaurant should have been aware of the danger of frostbite posed by its soft drinks.
F: inadmissible, because it is not probative of a fact in issue.
G: admissible to prove the restaurant's negligence, provided that the court gives a cautionary instruction that the testimony should not be considered as bearing on the issue of damages.
H: inadmissible, because it seeks to put into evidence separate, unrelated transactions with a third party.
I: admissible, as it demonstrates the restaurant's knowledge of the risk associated with their soft drinks.
J: inadmissible, because it constitutes character evidence against the restaurant.

Okay, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with admissibility of testimony in a trial. Let me try to break it down. 

The scenario is that a man sued a restaurant for negligence after spilling a soft drink on his lap and suffering frostbite. His attorney is calling a witness who also had a similar incident two weeks earlier, spilling a soft drink and getting frostbite. The witness told the restaurant about it immediately. The restaurant's attorney objects, and the judge has to rule on whether this testimony is admissible.

So the question is about whether the witness's testimony is admissible or not, and under what grounds. Let's go through the options one by one.

First, I remember that in evidence law, prior incidents can sometimes be admissible to show notice or a pattern of behavior. But they're not always admissible, especially if they're too remote or not sufficiently similar.

Option A says it's admissible to prove negligence but not for damages. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the case. The purpose here might be to show that the restaurant knew about the problem, which could relate to their negligence, not directly about the man's damages.

Option B claims it's inadmissible as an unrelated incident. But wait, the incidents are similar—both involve spilling soft drinks and frostbite. So they might be related. But maybe the timing is an issue. Two weeks earlier could be recent enough, showing that the restaurant had notice and failed to act.

Option C suggests it's admissible as a similar occurrence proving a pattern of negligence. That sounds plausible because similar incidents can show that the defendant was negligent in a recurring way. But I think the rules on this are specific. I recall that under FRE 406, evidence of a person’s character trait or tendency is usually inadmissible, but there are exceptions. Wait, no, FRE 405 deals with methods of proving character, but maybe this is about prior incidents showing a pattern.

Wait, another thought: This might fall under the category of "similar acts" evidence. Generally, prior acts can't be used to prove that the person acted in a certain way on a particular occasion, but they can be used for other purposes, like showing knowledge or notice. 

So in this case, the man's attorney is trying to show that the restaurant knew their drinks were dangerous. If the witness told them about her frostbite, that gives them notice. So the testimony could be admissible to prove that the restaurant had knowledge, which is part of the negligence claim.

Option E says it's admissible to show the restaurant should have known about the danger. That seems right because if they had a prior incident and were informed, that establishes notice, a key element of negligence.

But wait, the witness's testimony is about her own experience. So it's not just about the incident, but also that she told the restaurant. That part would be important because it shows the restaurant had actual knowledge.

Option I says it's admissible as it demonstrates the restaurant's knowledge. That also sounds correct, but I need to see which option aligns with the rules.

Option C says it's admissible as a similar occurrence showing a pattern. But I think the primary purpose here is to show notice, not just a pattern. So maybe E or I.

Looking at the options again, E is about proving the restaurant should have been aware, and I is about demonstrating their knowledge.

So under FRE 803(21), or perhaps as non-hearsay, since the statement by the witness about telling the restaurant is being offered to prove that the restaurant knew, not for the truth of the incident itself. Or maybe it's not hearsay because it's a statement about what the witness did, not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.

Wait, no, the fact that the witness told the restaurant is being used to show that the restaurant had notice, so it's not hearsay because it's a statement about an event (communication) that's relevant for its effect, not for the truth of the matter asserted.

So the witness's testimony about her own frostbite and informing the restaurant would be admissible to show the restaurant's knowledge. So that would make option E correct.

But wait, another angle: the fact that the witness had a similar incident could be considered as a prior occurrence. But the rules on prior occurrences can be tricky. For example, in products liability, prior accidents can be used to show notice or defect.

In this case, the prior incident shows that the restaurant had notice of the dangerous temperature of their drinks, which is relevant to whether they were negligent in the plaintiff's case.

So the testimony is admissible for the purpose of showing that the restaurant had knowledge of the risk, which makes option E correct.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option E says admissible to prove the restaurant should have been aware of the danger. Option I says admissible as it demonstrates the restaurant's knowledge.

The distinction is between "should have been aware" (which is constructive knowledge) and actual knowledge. The witness told the restaurant, so that's actual knowledge. So option I might be more precise because it's about demonstrating their actual knowledge, not just that they should have known.

But looking back, option E says "should have been aware," which implies constructive notice. But the witness's informing them makes it actual notice. So which option is better?

Option I: "admissible, as it demonstrates the restaurant's knowledge of the risk associated with their soft drinks." That seems correct because the witness informed them, showing actual knowledge.

Wait, but the question is about the admissibility of the entire testimony, including both the frostbite incident and the informing. So the prior incident plus the notification.

So the testimony serves two purposes: showing that a similar incident happened, which could indicate a pattern or a problem, and that the restaurant was informed, showing they knew about it.

So the admissibility would be for the purpose of proving notice, which is part of negligence. So the testimony is admissible to show that the restaurant had knowledge, which makes option I correct.

Alternatively, option E is about the restaurant's awareness, whether they should have known. But since the witness told them, it's more than should have known—it's actual knowledge.

So I think the correct answer is E or I. But looking back, option E says "should have been aware," which is constructive knowledge, while option I says "demonstrates the restaurant's knowledge," which is actual.

Since the witness told them, it's actual knowledge, so option I seems better.

Wait, but let's think about the rules again. Under FRE 402, evidence is admissible if it's relevant. To be relevant, it must have a tendency to make a fact of consequence more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.

Here, the fact that another person was injured and informed the restaurant makes it more probable that the restaurant knew about the danger. So it's relevant and admissible for that purpose.

Thus, the testimony is admissible to show the restaurant's knowledge, which is option I.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check each option again.

Option C: admissible as similar occurrence proving pattern of negligence. That could be correct, but the primary issue is notice, not just a pattern.

Option E: admissible to prove restaurant should have been aware. So that's constructive knowledge.

Option I: admissible as demonstrates restaurant's knowledge. That's actual knowledge.

In this case, the witness told the restaurant, so it's actual knowledge, making option I correct.

Wait, but the question is about the admissibility of the testimony as a whole. The witness testifying about her own incident and informing the restaurant.

So the testimony includes both the prior incident and the notification. The prior incident shows that there was a problem, and the notification shows the restaurant was aware.

So the purpose is to prove that the restaurant had notice, which is an element of negligence. Therefore, the testimony is admissible for that purpose.

Looking at the options, option E says it's admissible to prove the restaurant should have been aware. Option I says it's admissible to demonstrate their knowledge.

Since the restaurant was actually told, it's more than "should have been aware"—it's actual knowledge. So option I is more accurate.

Wait, but let me think again. The witness's testimony about her informing the restaurant is not hearsay. She's testifying about her own statement. So that's admissible as a fact, not for the truth of the matter asserted (that the drink was dangerous), but to show that the restaurant was informed.

So the entire testimony is relevant to show notice, making it admissible.

So the correct ruling is that the testimony is admissible to show the restaurant's knowledge, which would make option I correct.

Wait, but another point: under FRE 403, even if relevant, evidence can be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by prejudice. But I don't think that's the issue here. The question is about admissibility, not exclusion under 403.

So putting it all together, the witness's testimony is admissible to show the restaurant's knowledge, making option I the correct answer.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a witness's testimony in a negligence case where a man sued a restaurant after suffering frostbite from spilling a soft drink. The witness testifies that she had a similar incident two weeks earlier and informed the restaurant about her injury. The issue is whether this testimony is admissible and for what purpose.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

- **Option A**: Suggests the testimony is admissible to prove negligence but not for damages. While the testimony could relate to negligence, it is not limited to this purpose, as it also establishes notice, which is a critical element of negligence.

- **Option B**: Argues the testimony is inadmissible as an unrelated incident. This is incorrect because the incidents are similar (both involve spilling soft drinks and frostbite), making them relevant and not entirely unrelated.

- **Option C**: Claims the testimony is admissible to prove a pattern of negligence. While similar incidents can sometimes show a pattern, the primary purpose here is to establish notice, not just a pattern of behavior.

- **Option D**: States the testimony is inadmissible as hearsay. This is incorrect because the witness is testifying about her own experiences and statements, which are not hearsay.

- **Option E**: Suggests the testimony is admissible to prove the restaurant "should have been aware" of the danger. This implies constructive knowledge, but the witness's notification makes it actual knowledge, which is more precise.

- **Option F**: Argues the testimony is inadmissible because it is not probative of a fact in issue. This is incorrect because the testimony is highly probative, as it establishes notice and relevance to the restaurant's potential negligence.

- **Option G**: Proposes the testimony is admissible to prove negligence with a cautionary instruction. While the testimony could prove negligence, the primary focus is on notice, and no cautionary instruction is necessary for this purpose.

- **Option H**: Claims the testimony is inadmissible as evidence of unrelated transactions. This is incorrect because the incidents are similar and directly relevant to the case.

- **Option I**: States the testimony is admissible to demonstrate the restaurant's actual knowledge of the risk. This is the most accurate option because the witness informed the restaurant, establishing actual knowledge, which is a key element of negligence.

- **Option J**: Argues the testimony is inadmissible as character evidence. This is incorrect because the testimony is not being used to attack the restaurant's character but to establish notice and negligence.

### Conclusion:
The witness's testimony is admissible because it demonstrates the restaurant's actual knowledge of the risk associated with their soft drinks. This makes **Option I** the correct answer.
