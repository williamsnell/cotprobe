Okay, so I need to figure out how much Mr. Jackson still owes on his loan in 2015 when he decides to pay it off. Let me start by understanding the problem.

He bought the house in 1995 and took a 30-year loan at 7.8% interest. His monthly payment was $1260. Now, in 2015, that's 20 years later because 2015 minus 1995 is 20 years. So he's been paying for 20 years and now wants to pay off the remaining balance.

Hmm, wait, but I should double-check that. 30 years from 1995 would end in 2025. Oh right, because 1995 plus 30 is 2025. So in 2015, 20 years have passed. So he's made 20 years' worth of monthly payments.

So the question is, what's the remaining balance after 20 years of payments on a 30-year loan.

I remember that to calculate the remaining balance on a mortgage, you can use the present value of an annuity formula, but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, maybe I can find the outstanding balance using the loan amortization formula.

The formula for the remaining balance after a certain number of payments is similar to the present value of an ordinary annuity. The present value (PV) formula is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

But wait, in this case, the PV after n payments would be the remaining balance. Because each payment is reducing the principal plus interest.

Wait no, wait. The original loan amount was the present value at the start. Now, after 20 years, the remaining balance is the present value of the remaining 10 years of payments.

Wait, actually, the loan was for 30 years, so after 20 years, there's 10 years left. So the balance would be the present value of the remaining 120 monthly payments (10 years *12 months) at the same interest rate.

But wait, I'm not sure if I'm getting this right. Let me think again.

The initial loan amount (let's call it P) was such that the monthly payment (PMT) of $1260 would pay it off over 30 years at 7.8% annual interest. So P can be found using the present value formula.

P = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Where r is the monthly interest rate, which is 7.8% divided by 12, and n is the total number of payments, which is 30*12=360.

But wait, in this problem, we don't know P because we already have PMT. So maybe I don't need P. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the remaining balance directly after 240 payments (20 years), which would be the present value of the remaining 120 payments at the same rate.

Wait, yes, that's probably the right approach. Because after 20 years (240 payments), the remaining balance is the present value of the next 120 payments, discounted back to the present.

So let me lay out the variables I have:

PMT = $1260 (monthly)
r = 7.8%/12 = 0.0065 per month
n_remaining = 10 years *12 = 120 months

So the remaining balance (B) is:

B = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n_remaining ) / r ]

Let me plug in the numbers.

First, calculate (1 + r)^n_remaining.

n_remaining is 120, so 1 + 0.0065 = 1.0065. Raise that to the 120th power.

I can approximate that. Let me think about how to calculate 1.0065^120.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using logarithms or exponentials, but perhaps it's easier to calculate it using the formula step by step.

Wait, perhaps I can use the present value interest factor of an ordinary annuity (PVIFA). The formula is [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r.

So let me compute that factor.

r = 0.0065
n =120

Compute (1 + 0.0065)^120.

Let me compute this. I'll try to compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I remember that (1 + r)^n can be approximated, but maybe I can use logarithms.

ln(1.0065) = approx 0.006470 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3..., and for small x, it's close to x. So 0.0065 is about 0.65%, so ln(1.0065) ≈ 0.00645.

So ln(1.0065^120) = 120 * ln(1.0065) ≈ 120 * 0.00645 = 0.774.

So e^0.774 is approximately 2.169. Wait, because e^0.7 is about 2.0138, e^0.774 is a bit higher. Let me check more accurately.

Wait, wait, 0.774 is the exponent. So e^0.774 = approx 2.169.

Wait, but that's the value of (1.0065)^120 ≈ 2.169?

Wait, that doesn't sound right because 1.0065^120 would be the future value of $1 after 120 months at 0.65% per month. 0.65% per month is 7.8% annually, so over 10 years, the future value should be more than double, perhaps.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the natural log approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 72 to estimate. The rule of 72 says that at 7.8% annually, the doubling time is about 72/7.8 ≈ 9.23 years. So in 10 years, it's a bit more than double. So perhaps 2.2 times.

So (1.0065)^120 ≈ 2.2.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator, but since this is a thought process, perhaps I can proceed with an approximate value.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about the actual calculation.

Let me compute (1.0065)^120 more accurately.

We can compute it using the formula for compound interest.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step, but that would take a long time.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a better approximation.

Wait, 0.0065 is 6.5 basis points, so each month's rate is 0.0065.

The formula for (1 + r)^n is e^(n * ln(1 + r)).

So ln(1.0065) ≈ 0.00645 (as before). So n=120, ln(1.0065)^n = 120 * 0.00645 = 0.774.

e^0.774 is approximately 2.169.

So (1.0065)^120 ≈ 2.169.

So (1 + r)^-n = 1/2.169 ≈ 0.461.

So [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] = 1 - 0.461 = 0.539.

Then, [0.539] / r = 0.539 / 0.0065 ≈ let's compute that.

0.539 divided by 0.0065.

Well, 0.0065 * 80 = 0.52, so 0.539 is 0.019 more than 0.52.

So 80 + (0.019 / 0.0065) ≈ 80 + 2.923 ≈ 82.923.

So the factor is approximately 82.923.

So the present value (B) is 1260 * 82.923.

Let me compute that.

1260 * 80 = 100,800.

1260 * 2.923 ≈ Let's compute 1260 * 2 = 2520; 1260 * 0.923 ≈ 1260 * 0.9 = 1134, 1260 * 0.023=28.98. So 1134 +28.98=1162.98.

So 2520 +1162.98=3682.98.

So total B is approximately 100,800 + 3,682.98=104,482.98.

Looking at the options, option G is 104761.48, which is close to this approximation. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but perhaps my approximations are a bit off because I estimated (1.0065)^120 as 2.169, but perhaps it's a bit higher or lower. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the actual formula for the remaining balance. Wait, another approach is to calculate the outstanding balance after 20 years using the formula:

Balance = P * [ (1 + r)^n * r / ((1 + r)^n - 1) ) ]

Wait, no, that's the formula for the monthly payment. Alternatively, the remaining balance can be calculated using:

Remaining Balance = P * (1 + r)^(n_payments) - (PMT / r) * ( (1 + r)^n_payments - 1 )

But perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just use the present value approach, which I did earlier, and that gave me around 104,483, which is very close to option G: 104761.48.

So I think the correct answer is option G.

To determine the remaining balance on Mr. Jackson's loan in 2015, we calculate the present value of the remaining 10 years (120 monthly payments) of his mortgage. The loan originally had a 30-year term at an annual interest rate of 7.8%, with a monthly payment of $1260. After 20 years (240 payments), the remaining balance is the present value of the next 120 payments.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is:

\[
PV = PMT \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}
\]

Where:
- \(PMT = 1260\) (monthly payment),
- \(r = \frac{7.8\%}{12} = 0.0065\) (monthly interest rate),
- \(n = 120\) (remaining number of payments).

First, calculate \((1 + r)^n\):
\[
(1 + 0.0065)^{120} \approx 2.169
\]

Then, calculate \((1 + r)^{-n}\):
\[
(1 + 0.0065)^{-120} = \frac{1}{2.169} \approx 0.461
\]

Next, calculate the present value factor:
\[
\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} = \frac{1 - 0.461}{0.0065} = \frac{0.539}{0.0065} \approx 82.923
\]

Finally, calculate the remaining balance:
\[
PV = 1260 \times 82.923 \approx 104,482.98
\]

This value is closest to option G: **104761.48**. The slight difference is due to rounding during intermediate calculations.
