Alright, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again. The question is asking which of the options is equal to one. The options are from A to J, each representing a different economic concept.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in economics, especially in macroeconomics, there are several multipliers. Wait, multipliers... like the fiscal multiplier, investment multiplier, etc. Each of these affects the economy in different ways. I think the key is to remember which of these multipliers equals one.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: The elasticity of the long-run aggregate supply curve. I recall that the long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical because in the long run, the economy is at its potential output and changes in the price level don't affect real output. So if the curve is vertical, its elasticity would be zero, not one. So A isn't the answer.

Option B: The spending (or expenditure) multiplier. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think the expenditure multiplier is related to how much consumption changes with income. But I'm not sure if it's one. Maybe when there's no taxes or other factors, but I'm not certain. I'll have to come back to this.

Option C: The investment multiplier. Oh wait, the investment multiplier is about how much investment affects income. But I think its value is more than one because of the multiplier effect. So probably not equal to one.

Option D: The balanced budget multiplier. Hmm, I remember that the balanced budget multiplier is about how government spending and taxes affect the economy. I think when the government increases spending and taxes by the same amount, the multiplier is one. Because the initial spending increases income, which leads to more taxes, but the balanced part means the net effect is still positive. So D could be the right answer.

Option E: The aggregate demand multiplier. I'm not too sure about this one. I think aggregate demand has a multiplier effect based on the marginal propensity to consume. But I'm not sure if it's equal to one. It might be, but I need to think more.

Option F: The income multiplier. Oh right, the income multiplier is also known as the consumption multiplier. It's based on the MPC (marginal propensity to consume). So if MPC is 0.5, the multiplier is 1/(1-0.5) = 2. So that's not one.

Option G: The fiscal policy multiplier. I think this is similar to the government spending multiplier. The standard multiplier is (1/(1-MPC)), but when considering taxes, it might be different. Wait, but I'm not certain if it's equal to one.

Option H: The money (or banking) multiplier. This relates to how much the money supply increases with a change in reserves. I think it's calculated as 1/(reserve requirement). So if the reserve is 20%, the multiplier is 5. So that's not one.

Option I: The inflation multiplier. I'm not too familiar with this term. Maybe it's how inflation affects something, but I don't recall this being a standard term. Possibly not the answer.

Option J: The interest rate multiplier. I'm not sure. There's the liquidity preference or the interest sensitivity... but I don't remember this multiplier being exactly one.

Wait, going back to option D, the balanced budget multiplier. I think in a balanced budget, where government purchases increase by ΔG and taxes increase by ΔT, and ΔG=ΔT. The formula is (ΔG)/(1 - MPC + MPT), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the standard balanced budget multiplier formula is actually 1. Because when G and T both increase by the same amount, the net effect on aggregate demand is G - T, but since they're equal, it's zero. Wait no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Oh, right, the balanced budget multiplier is equal to 1. Because when the government increases both its spending and taxes by the same amount, the overall effect on equilibrium income is equal to the increase in spending. So, for example, if G and T both increase by 100, the multiplier is 1, meaning the income increases by 100. So D is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the spending multiplier. Let me clarify: the government spending multiplier is (1/(1-MPC)). But when accompanied by a tax increase, it's the balanced budget multiplier, which is 1. So yes, D is the correct answer.

So the answer is D.

The question asks which of the given options is equal to one. To determine the correct answer, each option is analyzed:

- **Option A**: The elasticity of the long-run aggregate supply curve is not relevant here, as the long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical, implying zero elasticity, not one.  
- **Option B**: The spending (or expenditure) multiplier is related to consumption and income but does not inherently equal one.  
- **Option C**: The investment multiplier describes how investment affects income, but its value is typically greater than one due to the multiplier effect.  
- **Option D**: The balanced budget multiplier occurs when government spending and taxes increase by the same amount. In this case, the net effect on equilibrium income is exactly equal to the increase in spending, making the multiplier equal to one.  
- **Option E**: The aggregate demand multiplier depends on factors like the marginal propensity to consume and does not inherently equal one.  
- **Option F**: The income multiplier, also known as the consumption multiplier, is calculated as \( \frac{1}{1 - MPC} \), which is typically greater than one.  
- **Option G**: The fiscal policy multiplier is similar to the government spending multiplier and does not inherently equal one.  
- **Option H**: The money (or banking) multiplier is calculated as \( \frac{1}{\text{reserve requirement}} \), which is typically greater than one.  
- **Option I**: The inflation multiplier is not a standard term and does not equal one.  
- **Option J**: The interest rate multiplier is not a standard term and does not equal one.  

The correct answer is **Option D**, as the balanced budget multiplier is equal to one when government spending and taxes increase by the same amount. 

Answer: D
