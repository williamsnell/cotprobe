Okay, so I have this physics problem here about lenses and chromatic aberration. Hmm, I remember that chromatic aberration is when a lens focuses different colors of light at slightly different points because each color has a different wavelength and thus a different refractive index. 

The question is about a lens made of borate flint glass. They give me the value of ν, which is the reciprocal of the dispersive power. Wait, the dispersive power is (n_blue - n_red), so ν must be 1 divided by that, right? So ν = 1/(n_blue - n_red). 

The focal length for sodium light is given as 30 inches. Sodium light is usually considered as the yellow light, I think, with a wavelength around 589 nm. So that's the reference point here. But the problem is asking about the distance between the red and blue images formed by the lens. Oh, that's the longitudinal chromatic aberration, meaning the red and blue images are at different distances from the lens.

So I need to find the difference in focal lengths between red and blue light. Wait, but how do I approach that? I think the formula for the focal length is f = R/(n-1), where R is related to the radii of the lens surfaces. But wait, that's for a thin lens in air, right? Hmm, but here, the lens is in air, I think, because it's just a lens in air focusing light.

Wait, no, the focal length formula when the lens is surrounded by a medium (like air) is f = (n-1)^-1 * (1/r1 - 1/r2), but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Alternatively, for a thin lens in air, the focal length f is given by 1/f = (n-1)(1/r1 - 1/r2). So if the lens is made of a material with refractive index n, then f depends on n.

But in this problem, the focal length for sodium light is 30 inches. So for sodium light, f_yellow = 30 inches. I need to find the focal lengths for red and blue, then find the difference between them.

Wait, but wait. The dispersive power relates to how much the refractive index changes with wavelength. So the difference in focal lengths comes from the difference in refractive indices for red and blue.

Given ν = 55.2. I remember that ν is defined as (n - 1)/(n_blue - n_red), but wait no, wait. Wait, the Abbe number ν is given by (n_d - 1)/(n_F - n_C), where d is sodium light, F is blue, and C is red. Oh right, Abbe number is defined as ν = (n_d - 1)/(n_F - n_C). So that's the formula.

So ν is given as 55.2, so (n_d -1)/(n_F - n_C) = 55.2.

But I'm trying to find the difference in focal lengths between red and blue. So I need to find (1/f_red) - (1/f_blue) or something like that, because the focal length changes with the refractive index.

Wait, the focal length f is given by the lensmaker's equation. For a thin lens in air, 1/f = (n-1)(1/r1 - 1/r2). So for different wavelengths, n changes, so f changes.

Let me think. Let’s denote:

For sodium (yellow) light, n = n_d.

For red light, n = n_C.

For blue light, n = n_F.

So for each color, the focal length is:

f_d = 1 / [ (n_d -1) (1/r1 - 1/r2) ) ]

Similarly,

f_red = 1 / [ (n_C -1) (1/r1 - 1/r2) ) ]

f_blue = 1 / [ (n_F -1) (1/r1 - 1/r2) ) ]

But since the lensmaker's equation for the given lens in air is 1/f = (n-1)(1/r1 - 1/r2), and for sodium light, f is 30 inches.

So (1/r1 - 1/r2) can be found from the sodium data.

Let me denote:

(1/r1 - 1/r2) = (1/f_d) ) / (n_d -1) 

Because 1/f_d = (n_d -1)(1/r1 - 1/r2) → (1/r1 - 1/r2) = 1/(f_d (n_d -1)).

But then, for red and blue:

1/f_red = (n_C -1) * (1/r1 -1/r2 ) = (n_C -1) * [1/(f_d (n_d -1)) ) ]

So f_red = [ f_d (n_d -1) ] / (n_C -1 )

Similarly, f_blue = [ f_d (n_d -1) ] / (n_F -1 )

So the difference in focal length between blue and red would be f_blue - f_red.

So Δf = f_blue - f_red = [ f_d (n_d -1) ( 1/(n_F -1) - 1/(n_C -1) ) ]

Let me compute that.

But wait, I need expressions in terms of ν. Let's see, ν is given by (n_d -1)/(n_F - n_C) ) = 55.2.

Wait, no, earlier I thought ν = (n_d -1)/(n_F - n_C). But wait, actually, the Abbe number is ν = (n_d -1)/(n_F - n_C), yes. Because n_F > n_C, so n_F - n_C is positive.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The Abbe number is defined as ν = (n_d -1)/(n_F - n_C), where n_F is the refractive index for blue light (like F line of hydrogen), and n_C is for red (C line of hydrogen). So yes, ν = (n_d -1)/(n_F - n_C).

So from that, (n_F - n_C) = (n_d -1)/ ν.

So (n_F - n_C) = (n_d -1)/55.2.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Let me think about f_blue and f_red.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express (1/f_red) - (1/f_blue) in terms of (n_C -1) and (n_F -1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe another approach. Since the focal length for sodium is 30 inches, and knowing that the focal length changes with the refractive index, perhaps the difference in focal lengths can be found using the Abbe number.

I remember that the longitudinal chromatic aberration (distance between images) is given by Δf = f * ( (1 - (n_d -1)/(n -1) ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using the relation involving the Abbe number.

Alternatively, another approach: The change in focal length with wavelength can be approximated. The difference in focal length between two wavelengths (red and blue) would be:

Δf = f_na * ( (n_blue - n_red)/(n_na -1) ) * (1/ν )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the formula for longitudinal chromatic aberration.

Wait, I think the longitudinal chromatic aberration (the distance between the two images) is given by:

Δf = (f_na * (n_blue - n_red)) / (n_na -1 )

But wait, n_blue - n_red is the dispersive power, which is 1/ν * (n_na -1), because ν = (n_na -1)/(n_blue - n_red).

So substituting:

Δf = (f_na * (1/ν) * (n_na -1) ) / (n_na -1 )

So the (n_na -1) terms cancel out, giving Δf = f_na / ν.

Wait, that can't be right because the units don't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, let me re-examine. Suppose f_na is the focal length for sodium light, which is 30 inches.

The formula I recall is that the chromatic aberration is Δf = (f_na) * (n_blue - n_red) / (n_na -1 )

But since ν = (n_na -1)/(n_blue - n_red), then (n_blue - n_red) = (n_na -1)/ν.

Substituting into Δf:

Δf = f_na * ( (n_na -1)/ν ) / (n_na -1 )

Which simplifies to Δf = f_na / ν.

So Δf = 30 inches / 55.2.

Let me compute that. 30 / 55.2.

Hmm, 30 divided by 55.2. Let me compute:

55.2 goes into 30 zero times. 30/55.2 = 0.543 approx.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute more accurately.

55.2 = 55.2

30 / 55.2 = (30 * 10)/(55.2 *10) = 300 / 552 = Let's divide numerator and denominator by 12: 300/12=25, 552/12=46. So 25/46 ≈ 0.54347826...

So approximately 0.543 inches. Looking at the options, option A is 0.54 inches, option J is 0.50, etc.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting 0.543 inches, which is about 0.54 inches, which is option A.

But wait, I need to make sure I have the right formula. Because sometimes the formula might involve the reciprocal or something else.

Wait, another thought: the formula I used gives the difference between the two focal lengths, but is that correct? Because earlier reasoning suggested that.

Wait, but let me think again. Let me double-check the formula.

The longitudinal chromatic aberration (Δf) is given by the difference between the focal lengths of the extreme colors (like red and violet/blue). The formula is Δf = (f_na) * (1/ν), where ν is the Abbe number. So that would give 30 / 55.2 ≈ 0.543 inches, which matches option A.

But wait, another possibility is that I might have the formula inverted. Suppose the formula is Δf = (f_na) / (ν). Then yes, 30/55.2 is about 0.543, option A.

But wait, let me think about units. ν is dimensionless, focal length is in inches. So the result would be inches, which matches.

But wait, let me think if I made a mistake in the formula. Because I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think of another way.

Another approach: The focal length for a particular wavelength is f = (n-1)^-1 * (1/(1/r1 - 1/r2)), but the (1/r1 - 1/r2) is fixed for the lens. Let's call that term K, so K = 1/r1 - 1/r2.

So for sodium light, f_na = 1/( (n_na -1) K ) = 30 inches.

For red light, f_red = 1/( (n_red -1) K )

Similarly, f_blue = 1/( (n_blue -1) K )

So the difference between f_blue and f_red is:

Δf = f_blue - f_red = [1/( (n_blue -1) K ) ] - [1/( (n_red -1) K ) ]

= (1/K) [ 1/(n_blue -1) - 1/(n_red -1) ]

Factor out 1/K:

= (1/K) [ (n_red -1 - n_blue +1 ) / ( (n_blue -1)(n_red -1) ) ) ]

Simplify numerator: (n_red - n_blue )

So:

Δf = (1/K) * (n_red - n_blue ) / [ (n_blue -1)(n_red -1) ) ]

But wait, n_red < n_blue, so n_red - n_blue is negative. So Δf would be negative, but I'm interested in the magnitude.

Wait, but let's think about this. Since n_blue > n_red, for a converging lens, the focal length is shorter for higher n. Because f is inversely proportional to (n-1). So if n_blue > n_red, then (n_blue -1) > (n_red -1), so 1/(n_blue -1) < 1/(n_red -1). So f_blue < f_red. So the blue image is closer to the lens than the red image. So the distance between them is f_red - f_blue.

So the difference Δf is positive and equal to f_red - f_blue.

So from the earlier equation, but perhaps I should have taken absolute value.

In any case, the expression I have for Δf is:

Δf = (1/K) * (n_red - n_blue ) / [ (n_blue -1)(n_red -1) ) ]

But since n_red < n_blue, (n_red - n_blue) is negative, so the overall Δf is negative, but since I'm taking the magnitude, I can write:

Δf = [ (n_blue - n_red ) / ( (n_blue -1)(n_red -1) ) ) ] * (1/K )

But I can express (n_blue - n_red) in terms of ν.

Because ν = (n_na -1)/(n_blue - n_red )

So n_blue - n_red = (n_na -1)/ν.

Substituting that into Δf:

Δf = [ ( (n_na -1)/ν ) / ( (n_blue -1)(n_red -1) ) ) ] * (1/K )

But from the sodium focal length, f_na = 30 = 1/( (n_na -1) K )

So K = 1/( (n_na -1) * 30 )

Substituting K into Δf:

Δf = [ (n_na -1)/(ν) ) / ( (n_blue -1)(n_red -1) ) ) ] * ( (n_na -1) * 30 )

Simplify numerator:

(n_na -1) * (n_na -1) * 30 / ( ν * (n_blue -1)(n_red -1) )

So:

Δf = (30 (n_na -1)^2 ) / ( ν (n_blue -1)(n_red -1) )

But this seems complicated. I'm not sure if I can simplify further without knowing the exact values of n_na, n_blue, and n_red.

Wait, maybe I can find a relation between (n_blue -1)(n_red -1) and (n_na -1). But I don't think that's straightforward. So perhaps my initial approach was better.

Wait, earlier I thought that Δf = f_na / ν. Let me see if that holds.

Because:

Δf = [ (n_blue - n_red ) / (n_na -1) ] * f_na.

Because using the formula Δf = (f_na (n_blue - n_red )) / (n_na -1 )

But since n_blue - n_red = (n_na -1)/ν,

Δf = (f_na ( (n_na -1)/ν )) / (n_na -1 )

So Δf = f_na / ν.

Yes, that's correct. So 30 inches / 55.2 equals approximately 0.543 inches.

Looking back at the options, option A is 0.54 inches. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because sometimes ν is defined differently. Let me double-check the definition of Abbe number.

Upon checking, the Abbe number ν is defined as ν = (n_d - 1)/(n_F - n_C), where n_d is for sodium D-line (about 589 nm), n_F is for hydrogen F-line (about 486 nm, blue), and n_C is for hydrogen C-line (about 656 nm, red). So yes, ν is (n_d-1)/(n_F - n_C).

So the formula Δf = f_na / ν holds, meaning 30/55.2 = ~0.543, which is 0.54 inches, option A.

But wait, looking at the options, option J is 0.50, which is close but not exact. But the exact calculation gives approximately 0.543, which is 0.54 when rounded to two decimal places.

So the correct answer should be option A: 0.54 inches.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance between the red and blue images formed by the lens due to chromatic aberration. The lens is made of borate flint glass, and the given parameters are:

- **Abbe number (ν)** = 55.2  
- **Focal length for sodium light (f_na)** = 30 inches  

The Abbe number is defined as:

\[
\nu = \frac{n_d - 1}{n_F - n_C}
\]

where \(n_d\) is the refractive index for sodium light (yellow, 589 nm), \(n_F\) is the refractive index for blue light (486 nm), and \(n_C\) is the refractive index for red light (656 nm). The longitudinal chromatic aberration (\(\Delta f\)), which is the distance between the red and blue images, can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta f = \frac{f_{\text{na}}}{\nu}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\Delta f = \frac{30}{55.2}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\Delta f \approx 0.543 \, \text{inches}
\]

This value rounds to **0.54 inches** when rounded to two decimal places. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**A: 0.54 inches**

Thus, the distance between the red and blue images formed by the lens is **0.54 inches**.
