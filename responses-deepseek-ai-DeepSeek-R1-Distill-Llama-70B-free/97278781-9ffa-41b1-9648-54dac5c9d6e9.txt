Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics question here about estimating the standard reaction Gibbs energy for the production of ammonia at a higher temperature. Alright, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The reaction given is N2(g) + 3 H2(g) → 2 NH3(g) at 500 K. They mentioned that all gases are perfect and data is at 298 K unless stated otherwise. I'm supposed to find the standard Gibbs energy change (ΔG°) for this reaction at 500 K.

Hmm, I remember that the standard Gibbs energy change for a reaction can be calculated using the formula ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°, but wait, that's at a specific temperature. Oh, right, but when the temperature changes, we need to adjust ΔH and ΔS accordingly, probably using the van't Hoff equation or some relation involving the Gibbs energies at different temperatures.

Wait, another approach: the Gibbs energy at another temperature can be found if we know ΔH° and ΔS° at 298 K. Since the problem gives us data for 298 K, maybe we can use those values to calculate ΔG° at 500 K.

But wait, I don't have the exact values of ΔH° and ΔS° for the reaction provided here. So perhaps I need to recall some standard values. Let me think. The formation of ammonia is exothermic, right? So the standard enthalpy change ΔH° should be negative. I think for the reaction as written (forming 2 moles of NH3), ΔH° is around -92 kJ/mol. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation for NH3 is about -46 kJ/mol per mole. So since the reaction forms 2 moles, ΔH° would be 2*(-46) = -92 kJ. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh, right, the reaction is N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3. So yes, ΔH° would be 2*(ΔHf of NH3) minus the reactants, which are elements in their standard state so their ΔHf is zero. So ΔH°(rxn) is 2*(-46) = -92 kJ.

Then, the entropy change ΔS° for the reaction. Well, gases are involved, and the reaction is going from 1 mole of N2 and 3 of H2 (total 4 moles) to 2 moles of NH3. So the entropy should decrease because we're going from 4 moles of gas to 2. So a negative ΔS°. Let me think of the standard molar entropies. I remember that S° for N2 is about 191 J/(mol·K), H2 is around 131 J/(mol·K), and NH3 is maybe 193 J/(mol·K). So let's calculate ΔS°.

ΔS° = [2 * S°(NH3)] - [S°(N2) + 3 * S°(H2)]
So plugging in numbers:
2*(193) - (191 + 3*131)
That's 386 - (191 + 393) = 386 - 584 = -198 J/(mol·K) → which is -198 J/K·mol. So converting to kJ, that's -0.198 kJ/(mol·K).

Now, at 298 K, the standard Gibbs energy change is ΔG°(298) = ΔH° - TΔS°. But wait, I don't know ΔG° at 298 K for this reaction. Oh wait, maybe I can calculate it, but wait, the question is about 500 K. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects me to use the van't Hoff equation to find ΔG at 500 K using the data at 298 K. Alternatively, I can use the relation:

ΔG2 = ΔH - T2 * ΔS

But wait, ΔH is the enthalpy change at the initial temperature (298 K), and T is the temperature in Kelvin. So for T2=500 K, I can compute ΔG at 500 K using ΔH (at 298) and ΔS (at 298), assuming that ΔH and ΔS don't change much with temperature, which might be an approximation.

So let's compute that. Wait, but wait a second. The formula is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. But wait, ΔH here is the standard enthalpy change at 298 K, and T is 500 K. But this approach assumes that ΔH and ΔS are constant with temperature, which is an approximation. But the problem says to estimate, so it's acceptable.

So, ΔH° is -92,000 J (since it's -92 kJ). ΔS° is -198 J/K. So at 500 K:

ΔG = (-92000 J) - (500 K) * (-198 J/K)
Let me compute each part.

First part: -92000 J.

Second part: 500 * (-198) = -99,000 J. But since it's subtracted, it becomes +99,000 J.

So ΔG = (-92,000) + 99,000 = 7,000 J → 7 kJ/mol.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

ΔH is -92,000 J. TΔS is 500 * (-198) = -99,000 J. So ΔG = ΔH - TΔS → -92000 - (-99000) → -92000 + 99000 = 7000 J, which is 7 kJ/mol.

But wait, the options are given in "mol⁻¹", so 7 kJ per mol. So looking at the options, option D is 7 mol⁻¹. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the sign somewhere.

Wait, wait. The reaction is N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3. The ΔH is -92,000 J (exothermic). The ΔS is negative because the system is becoming more ordered.

At higher temperatures, the TΔS term becomes more significant. Since ΔS is negative, TΔS is negative, so when you subtract TΔS (which is negative), you're adding a positive value.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation:

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS → ΔH is -92000 J, TΔS is 500 * (-198) = -99000 J.

So ΔG = (-92000) - (-99000) = (-92000) + 99000 = 7000 J → 7 kJ/mol. So positive 7 kJ/mol. So looking at the options, option D is 7 mol⁻¹.

Wait, but wait a moment. The standard Gibbs energy at 298 K can be calculated, but that's not what the question is asking. The question is about at 500 K. So the calculation I did should give the ΔG° at 500 K.

Wait another thing: wait, the standard Gibbs energy of reaction at 500 K can be found using:

ΔG°(T2) = ΔH°(T1) - T2 * ΔS°(T1)

But is that accurate? Well, if we assume that ΔH and ΔS don't change with temperature, which is an approximation, then yes. So yes, the calculation should be correct.

Therefore, the answer should be 7 kJ/mol, which is option D.

To estimate the standard reaction Gibbs energy (ΔG°) for the reaction:

$$\mathrm{N}_2(\mathrm{g}) + 3 \mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{NH}_3(\mathrm{g})$$

at 500 K, we use the relationship:

$$\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$$

### Step 1: Determine ΔH° and ΔS° at 298 K
- The standard enthalpy change, ΔH°, is calculated using the standard enthalpy of formation of ammonia ($\Delta_f H^\circ(\mathrm{NH}_3) = -46 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}$). Since the reaction forms 2 moles of NH$_3$, we have:

  $$\Delta H^\circ = 2 \times (-46 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}) = -92 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol} = -92,000 \, \mathrm{J/mol}.$$

- The standard entropy change, ΔS°, is calculated using standard molar entropies:  
  - $S^\circ(\mathrm{N}_2) = 191 \, \mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}$,  
  - $S^\circ(\mathrm{H}_2) = 131 \, \mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}$,  
  - $S^\circ(\mathrm{NH}_3) = 193 \, \mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}$.  

  Thus,

  $$\Delta S^\circ = [2 \times S^\circ(\mathrm{NH}_3)] - [S^\circ(\mathrm{N}_2) + 3 \times S^\circ(\mathrm{H}_2)],$$  
  $$\Delta S^\circ = [2 \times 193] - [191 + 3 \times 131] = 386 - 584 = -198 \, \mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)} = -0.198 \, \mathrm{kJ/(mol \cdot K)}.$$

### Step 2: Calculate ΔG° at 500 K
Using the formula $\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$, we substitute the values:  
- $\Delta H = -92,000 \, \mathrm{J/mol}$,  
- $T = 500 \, \mathrm{K}$,  
- $\Delta S = -198 \, \mathrm{J/(mol \cdot K)}$.  

First, calculate $T\Delta S$:  
$$T\Delta S = 500 \times (-198) = -99,000 \, \mathrm{J/mol}.$$

Now, calculate $\Delta G$:  
$$\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S = -92,000 - (-99,000) = -92,000 + 99,000 = 7,000 \, \mathrm{J/mol} = 7 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}.$$

### Final Answer
The standard reaction Gibbs energy for the reaction at 500 K is **7 kJ/mol**, which corresponds to **option D**.
