Alright, I've got this problem about finding the required capacitance to resonate a coil at a certain frequency. Okay, let's see. I remember that resonance in an LC circuit is when the inductive reactance equals the capacitive reactance. Oh right, the formula for the resonant frequency is f = 1/(2π√(LC)). So I need to find the capacitance C when given the inductance L and the frequency f.

Given L is 0.001 mH. Wait, mH is milliHenrys, so that's 0.001 times 1e-3 H, which makes it 1e-6 H. Oh wait, no, wait. 1 mH is 0.001 H, so 0.001 mH is 0.000001 H, which is 1e-6 H. Got it.

The frequency f is 2 MHz, which is 2e6 Hz. Okay, plugging into the formula. Let me rearrange the formula to solve for C. Starting with f = 1/(2π√(LC)), so rearranging:

√(LC) = 1/(2πf)
LC = 1/( (2πf)^2 )
So C = 1/( (2πf)^2 * L )

Let me compute this step by step. First, calculate 2πf. 2 * π is approximately 6.2832. Multiply by f (2e6 Hz): 6.2832 * 2e6 = 12.5664e6.

Wait, 2e6 is 2,000,000. So 6.2832 * 2,000,000 is 12,566,400. So (2πf)^2 is (12,566,400)^2. But wait, that's a huge number. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of exponents.

Wait, (2πf)^2 = (2π)^2 * f^2. So (2π)^2 is about 39.4784. Then f^2 is (2e6)^2 = 4e12. So 39.4784 * 4e12 = 1.579e14.

Wait, no. Wait, (2πf)^2 is (2π)^2 * f^2. So (2π)^2 is (approx) 39.478. f is 2e6, so f squared is 4e12. So 39.478 * 4e12 = approx 1.579e14.

Wait, but then L is 1e-6 H, so denominator is (2πf)^2 * L = 1.579e14 * 1e-6 = 1.579e8.

So C = 1 / (1.579e8 ) = approx 6.33e-9 F. Because 1e-9 F is 1 nF, 6.33e-9 is 6.33 nF, which is 6330 pF.

Hmm, looking at the options, option F is 6,330 pF. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have messed up the exponents.

Wait, let's do it another way. Let's compute 2πf:

2 * π ≈ 6.2832
f = 2e6 Hz.
So 2πf = 6.2832 * 2e6 = 12.5664e6 rad/s.

Now, (2πf)^2 = (12.5664e6)^2. Let me compute that:

12.5664e6 squared is (12.5664)^2 times 1e12. 12.5664 squared is approximately (12.566 is about 2π*2, but anyway):

12 * 12 is 144, 0.5664 squared is small, but let's compute 12.5664^2. 12^2 is 144. (0.5664)^2 is about 0.321. The cross term is 2*12*0.5664 = 13.5968. So total is 144 +13.5968 +0.321 ≈ 157.9178.

So (12.5664e6)^2 ≈ 157.9178e12 = 1.579178e14.

Now, L is 0.001 mH = 1e-6 H.

So (2πf)^2 * L = 1.579178e14 * 1e-6 = 1.579178e8.

So C = 1 / (1.579178e8) = approx 6.33e-9 F = 6.33 nF = 6330 pF.

So the correct option is F: 6,330 pF.

To determine the capacitance required to resonate a coil of 0.001 mH at a frequency of 2 MHz, we use the formula for the resonant frequency of an LC circuit:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \(C\):

\[
C = \frac{1}{(2\pi f)^2 \cdot L}
\]

### Given:
- \(L = 0.001 \, \text{mH} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{H}\)
- \(f = 2 \, \text{MHz} = 2 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz}\)

### Step 1: Calculate \(2\pi f\)
\[
2\pi f = 2 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 2 \times 10^6 = 12.5664 \times 10^6 \, \text{rad/s}
\]

### Step 2: Square \(2\pi f\)
\[
(2\pi f)^2 = (12.5664 \times 10^6)^2 = 1.579178 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

### Step 3: Multiply by \(L\)
\[
(2\pi f)^2 \cdot L = 1.579178 \times 10^{14} \cdot 1 \times 10^{-6} = 1.579178 \times 10^8
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \(C\)
\[
C = \frac{1}{1.579178 \times 10^8} \approx 6.33 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{F} = 6,330 \, \text{pF}
\]

### Final Answer:
The required capacitance is **6,330 pF**, which corresponds to option **F**.
