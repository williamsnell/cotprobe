Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The situation is about a shopkeeper who owns a vacant lot in fee simple absolute. In 1960, the shopkeeper conveyed the property using a general warranty deed. The deed says, "The grantor hereby conveys the vacant lot to my friend, but if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25." At the time of the conveyance, the sister was single. Then, the sister married and had two sons. One son died in a car accident. Three years after that, the sister had a daughter. Now, the question is about determining the ownership rights to the vacant lot, with all minors represented.

I'm a bit rusty on property law, but I remember that when a deed includes conditions like this, it's probably a future interest scenario. The initial conveyance is to the friend, but there's a condition that if the property is used for church purposes, it goes to the sister's children who reach 25.

So, the first thing is to parse the deed. The friend gets the property, but there's a condition subsequent or maybe a defeasance. Wait, the wording is "but if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children..." That sounds like a condition subsequent creating a right of reentry or an executory interest. Wait, or is it a springing executory interest?

In any case, the friend has a fee simple subject to an executory limitation. The executory interest is in the sister's children upon the condition that they reach 25. So, the structure is:

1. Present interest: Fee simple in the friend, but subject to a condition that if the property is used for church purposes, it goes to the sister's children who are 25.

Wait, no, the wording is "but if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25." So upon the occurrence of the condition (use for church), the property goes to the sister's children who have reached 25.

Wait, but does the condition trigger a shift immediately, or is it that when the property is used for church purposes, the ownership shifts to those children? And what about the children who haven't been born yet?

At the time of conveyance in 1960, the sister was single. So, she later married and had two sons, one of whom died, then a daughter. So, the sister has two sons and a daughter, but one son died.

The question is about ownership now. The minors are represented, so any interests they have are being considered.

Wait, but the condition is that the property is used for church purposes. The question doesn't say that happened yet. So, the property is still with the friend unless and until it's used for church purposes.

Wait, no, the question is about the ownership rights now, not when the condition is triggered. So, the friend holds the property unless the condition happens. So, the friend's interest is a fee simple subject to an executory interest in the sister's children upon reaching 25, but only if the property is ever used for church purposes.

But the problem says that the action is to determine ownership rights. So, perhaps the condition hasn't occurred yet, meaning the property is still with the friend, but the executory interest is held by whoever the beneficiaries are.

Wait, but the question is about who holds title now. So, the friend has the present fee simple, but the executory interest is in the sister's children who reach 25, but only if the condition is met.

But the condition is about the use for church purposes. So, until that happens, the friend has the fee simple absolute? Or is it a fee simple determinable or subject to a condition subsequent?

Wait, the wording is "if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children..." So, this is a condition subsequent, creating a right of reentry or an executory interest. Wait, no, a right of entry is typically for the grantor, but here it's going to the sister's children. So, it's an executory interest.

So, the initial conveyance is to the friend, giving the friend a fee simple subject to an executory limitation. The executory interest is in the sister's children who reach 25, but only upon the condition that the property is used for church purposes.

So, the current ownership is with the friend unless and until the condition is triggered.

Wait, but the question is about the ownership now, regardless of whether the condition has been met. So, the friend has a fee simple subject to executory limitation. The executory interest is held by the class of the sister's children who reach 25, but only when the condition (church use) happens.

So, the current title is with the friend, but if the property is ever used for church purposes, then the title shifts to the sister's children who are 25 or older.

But the question is about the ownership now, so the friend holds the fee simple, and the other parties have a contingent future interest.

Wait, but the sister had two sons and a daughter. Let me think about their status. The two sons: one died, so he can't reach 25 anymore. The other son is alive, but is he 25? The problem doesn't specify their ages. Hmm. The sister had two sons, then a daughter three years after the first son's death.

Wait, the timeline is: conveyance in 1960, sister was single. Then she married and had two sons. Then one son died in an automobile accident. Then three years after that, she had a daughter.

So, let's say the first son was born, say, 1965, died in, say, 1985 (age 20), then the sister had a daughter in 1988.

Assuming current time is, say, 2023, the daughter would be 35, so over 25. The second son, if born after the first, say in 1970, died in 1985 at age 15. Wait, no, he died in an automobile accident, but the exact age isn't given.

Wait, but the question is about the ownership now, with all minors represented. So, perhaps the surviving son and daughter are minors. Wait, but how old are they?

Alternatively, perhaps the daughter is a minor, and the surviving son is a minor as well. Or maybe the surviving son is over 25.

Wait, the problem doesn't give specific ages, so I can't assume. So, perhaps the key is that the executory interest is in the sister's children who reach 25, but it's contingent upon two things: the property being used for church purposes, and the child reaching 25.

So, the executory interest is a contingent remainder in the sister's children upon reaching 25, but only if the condition (church use) is met.

Now, since the condition hasn't been met (the property isn't used for church purposes yet), the executory interest hasn't cut in, so the friend still holds the fee simple.

But the question is about the current ownership. So, the friend owns the property. The executory interest is held by the class of the sister's children who reach 25, but that's only if the condition occurs.

Wait, but the sister's children include the two sons and the daughter. One son is deceased. The other son and the daughter might be living. But since the condition hasn't occurred, the friend still has the fee simple.

Wait, but the question is about the title now. So, the friend holds the fee simple, but subject to the executory limitation.

So, the options are:

A: friend and sister.

B: friend, deceased son, and daughter.

C: friend only.

D: friend, son, daughter, and any additional children.

E: friend and any children reaching 25.

F: sister and her children.

G: friend and surviving son only.

H: friend, surviving son, sister.

I: friend, son, daughter, additional children within 21 years.

J: friend, son, daughter.

Wait, from my analysis, the friend holds the fee simple now, subject to the executory interest. So, the executory interest is in the sister's children who reach 25 if the condition is met. Since the condition hasn't been met, the friend is the current owner.

So, looking at the options, option C is "the friend only." That would make sense if the friend holds the fee simple absolute, but wait, no, because the executory interest is still out there. So, the friend's interest is a fee simple subject to executory limitation, meaning that if the condition occurs, the executory interest takes effect.

But the question is about the current ownership. So, unless the condition has been triggered, the friend is the sole owner. Therefore, the correct answer would be C: the friend only.

Wait, but let me think again. The executory interest is held by the sister's children, but only when the condition is met. So, until then, the friend has the fee simple, but it's subject to that future interest.

So, the current title is with the friend, but if the condition is met, it goes to the sister's children who have reached 25. But if the condition hasn't occurred, then the friend owns it, and the sister's children have a contingent future interest.

But the question is asking who holds title now. So, the title is with the friend, because the executory interest hasn't vested yet. So, the answer would be C.

Wait, but another angle: the conveyance was to the friend, but with a springing executory interest to the sister's children upon the condition. So, the friend has a fee simple subject to executory limitation, and the executory interest is held by the sister's children who reach 25. So, the executory interest is a future interest, but it's contingent on both the condition (church use) and reaching 25.

So, the current ownership is the friend. So, the answer is C.
</think>

The shopkeeper conveyed the vacant lot to the friend in 1960 with a condition: "if the property shall ever be used for church purposes, then to the children of my sister who reach the age of 25." This creates a fee simple subject to an executory limitation. The friend holds the present interest, while the sister's children who reach the age of 25 hold a contingent executory interest that will vest only if the condition (use for church purposes) is triggered.

At the time of the conveyance, the sister was single, and she later married and had two sons and a daughter. One son died, and the sister had a daughter three years after his death. The question asks about the current ownership rights to the vacant lot, with all minors represented. Importantly, the condition (use for church purposes) has not occurred yet. Therefore, the executory interest has not vested, and the friend remains the sole owner of the property.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The sister has no present ownership rights; her children hold a contingent executory interest.
- **B**: Incorrect. The deceased son cannot inherit, and the friend's interest is not shared with the daughter or the deceased son.
- **C**: Correct. The friend holds the fee simple, subject to the executory limitation, and no other party has a present ownership interest.
- **D**: Incorrect. The executory interest is limited to the sister's children who reach the age of 25, and there is no indication of additional children.
- **E**: Incorrect. The executory interest depends on both the condition (church use) and reaching the age of 25, not just the latter.
- **F**: Incorrect. The sister has no ownership rights, only her children hold a contingent executory interest.
- **G**: Incorrect. The surviving son and the friend do not jointly hold ownership; the friend holds the fee simple.
- **H**: Incorrect. The sister has no ownership rights, and the surviving son holds only a contingent executory interest.
- **I**: Incorrect. The executory interest does not extend to additional children born within 21 years after the deceased son's death.
- **J**: Incorrect. The friend holds the fee simple, and the son and daughter hold only contingent executory interests.

The correct answer is **C**: the friend only.
