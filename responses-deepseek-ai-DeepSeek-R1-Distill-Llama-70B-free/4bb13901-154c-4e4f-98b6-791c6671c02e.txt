Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically assault and battery. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So Donny threw a knife at Sally intending to injure her severely. But he missed her; the knife went by about an inch from her head. Sally saw it and got scared. Now she's suing him for assault and battery. The question is asking which option is correct.

Hmm. I remember that assault and battery are two separate torts. Let me recall the definitions. Battery is when there's an intentional harmful or offensive touching of another person. The touching can be direct or with an object, like throwing something. Assault, on the other hand, is an intentional act that causes the plaintiff to fear imminent harmful or offensive contact. So it's more about the apprehension of harm.

In this case, Donny threw the knife intending to hurt Sally. So he definitely intended to commit a battery because he meant to hit her with the knife. But he missed, so there was no actual touching. Wait, so does that mean there's no battery? Because I think for battery, the touching must occur. If he missed, maybe there's no battery. But what about assault?

Assault requires that the defendant's action made the plaintiff reasonably fear that they were about to be touched in a harmful way. So when Donny threw the knife, Sally saw it and was scared. She was in fear of being hit. So that would be assault because he created the apprehension of imminent harmful contact. But since the knife missed, there was no actual battery. So he's liable for assault but not battery.

Wait, but wait a second. There's a concept called "transferred intent." I think that applies here. Transferred intent means that if you intend to commit a tort against one person but accidentally commit it against another, the intent transfers. But in this case, Donny intended to hit Sally, but he missed her. So if the intent was to hit her, but he didn't, does transferred intent apply? Or is that more for when the action affects someone else.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Transferred intent usually applies when, for example, Donny aims at Sally but hits someone else. Then the intent to hit Sally transfers, and he's liable for battery against the person he actually hit. But in this case, he didn't hit anyone, so it's a bit different.

So back to assault and battery. Battery requires the intentional touching. If he missed, no touching, so no battery. So he can't be liable for battery. But for assault, the act of throwing the knife would create an apprehension in Sally. So he's liable for assault.

Looking at the options, option C says Donny is liable for assault but not battery because he missed. Option J also says liable for assault not battery. But wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: "Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery because he missed Sally with the knife." Option J: "Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery."

Wait, so both C and J say he's liable for assault not battery. But what's the difference between C and J? Let me look again.

Option C says it's because he missed, J just states the liability without that reason. Hmm, but perhaps C is more accurate because it gives the reason. But I'm not sure. The key thing is whether intent for battery exists when he missed.

Wait, I think the majority rule is that assault doesn't require actual touching, only the apprehension. So Donny intended to hit her, which would have been a battery, but he missed. So the intent to commit battery is there, which supports the assault claim.

Wait, but wait another point. Some jurisdictions might say that if the defendant intended to commit a battery (which he did) and the plaintiff apprehends that, then that's assault. So in this scenario, Sally saw the knife and was scared, so she apprehended imminent harmful contact. Hence, assault.

So the correct answer would be that he's liable for assault but not battery. So looking at the options, that would be either C or J.

Wait, option C says he's liable for assault but not battery because he missed. Option J just says he's liable for assault, not battery. So both C and J are similar, but C adds the reason. So the question is, is missing the only reason why there's no battery? Yes, because without touching, there's no battery. So option C is correct.

But wait, another thought. What about the possibility that even if he missed, the intent was there, but some jurisdictions might consider that as an attempted battery, but I don't think that applies in tort law the same way as criminal law. In torts, the focus is on whether the elements are met, not the attempt.

So to sum up: Donny is liable for assault because he caused Sally to fear imminent harmful contact, but not for battery because he didn't touch her. So the correct answer is C or J. Wait, looking again, the options are:

Option C: Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery because he missed.

Option J: Donny will be liable for assault, but not battery.

So both C and J are correct in stating he's liable for assault, not battery. But C gives the reason. The question is asking which is most correct. I think both C and J could be correct, but perhaps the answer is C because it explains that the reason for no battery is because he missed.

Alternatively, sometimes the answer might hinge on the fact that battery requires an actual harmful touching. So since he missed, no battery. So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that when you intend to commit a battery, and the victim apprehends it, that's assault, but the actual battery would require the touching. So yes, in this case, no battery because no touching. So the correct answer is C.

But wait, let me think about option J. It says he's liable for assault, not battery. So both C and J are the same in that sense. So perhaps the correct answer is J, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, looking again, the options:

Option C says he's liable for assault but not battery because he missed. So that's correct because the reason is that he missed, so no touching.

Option J says he's liable for assault but not battery, without stating the reason.

So the correct answer is C.

Donny threw a knife at Sally with the intent to injure her, but he missed, and the knife passed by about an inch from her head. Sally, seeing the knife, was scared. To determine liability for assault and battery, the following analysis applies:

1. **Battery**: Battery requires an intentional, harmful, or offensive touching. Since Donny missed Sally and there was no physical contact, the element of touching is absent. Therefore, Donny is not liable for battery.

2. **Assault**: Assault requires an intentional act that causes the plaintiff to reasonably fear imminent harmful or offensive contact. Donny's act of throwing the knife, which Sally observed, created a reasonable apprehension of imminent harm. Thus, Donny is liable for assault.

Given the options, both **C** and **J** state that Donny is liable for assault but not battery. However, **C** explicitly provides the reason for the absence of battery: Donny missed Sally. This makes **C** the most accurate and complete answer.

ANSWER: C
