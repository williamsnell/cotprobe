Okay, so I've got this problem here about a teacher dividing stickers among students. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the teacher has three packages of stickers. The packages have 56, 48, and 58 stickers respectively. I think I need to find the total number of stickers first. So I should add those three numbers together. Let me do that: 56 plus 48 is... let me see, 56+40 is 96, plus 8 makes 104. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 56 + 48 is actually 104? Wait, 56+40 is 96, plus 8 is 104, yes. So then adding the third package, which is 58. So 104 plus 58. Hmm, 100 + 50 is 150, and 4 +8 is 12, so total is 162. Wait, no, 104 +58: 100+50=150, 4+8=12, so 162. So total stickers are 162.

Now, the teacher wants to divide all these stickers equally among 27 students. So I need to divide 162 by 27. Let me think about how to do that. 

I can try to see how many times 27 goes into 162. Let's see, 27 times 6 is 162 because 27*5 is 135, and 27 more would be 162, so that's 6. Oh wait, no, wait, wait. 27 times 6: 20*6=120, 7*6=42, so 120+42=162. So each student gets 6 stickers. 

Wait, but let me double-check the addition first. 56 +48 is 104, yes. 104 +58: 104 +50=154, plus 8 is 162. Yep. Then 162 divided by 27 is indeed 6. 

So looking at the options, option F is 6 stickers. So the answer should be F.

The teacher has three packages of stickers: 56, 48, and 58. Adding these together gives a total of 162 stickers. Dividing 162 stickers equally among 27 students results in each student receiving 6 stickers. 

F: 6 stickers

Answer: F
