Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Moche civilization, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking what the Moche built at the heart of their urban center. The options are A through J, each suggesting different structures or systems. I remember that the Moche were an ancient civilization in what's now northern Peru, flourishing around 100 to 700 AD. They're known for their impressive art, especially in ceramics and metallurgy.

I think the Moche were organized into city-states, and their urban centers were pretty complex. So, the heart of their cities probably had important structures. I recall that in many ancient cities, the central area is where you'd find temples, palaces, or other significant buildings that served as the political or religious hubs.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Temple of the Feathered Serpent. I think that's more associated with the Aztecs or maybe Teotihuacan. The Feathered Serpent deity, like Quetzalcoatl, was more central to Mesoamerican cultures, not so much the Moche.

Option B: An enormous walled-in precinct of elite residences. Hmm, that sounds plausible. The Moche were known for their social hierarchy, so having a walled area for elites makes sense. But I'm not sure if that's what's typically found in the heart of their cities.

Option C: Palace of the Painted Walls. I'm not too familiar with this name specifically, but it sounds like it could be a significant building. Maybe, but I don't have a strong memory of this.

Option D: A complex irrigation system. The Moche were skilled in irrigation, which allowed them to farm in arid regions. However, while important, an irrigation system might not be the central structure in the urban center. It's more of an infrastructure spread out.

Option E: Pyramid of the Sun. That's definitely from Teotihuacan, a Mesoamerican city, not the Moche. So E is probably not correct.

Option F: Tower of Moche. I'm not sure about this one. It doesn't ring a bell, so maybe it's not the right choice.

Option G: An extensive library of written records. Wait, I thought the Moche didn't have a written language. They used visual art for communication, so a library doesn't make sense here.

Option H: Central marketplace. Marketplaces are common, but again, in the Moche's case, I'm not sure if that's the central focus. They were more known for their ceremonial centers.

Option I: A vast complex of temples and artisan workshops. This sounds likely. The Moche were known for their religious structures and their artisan workshops, especially for metalworking and pottery. So the urban center might have a large area dedicated to both temples and workshops, which would be important for both religious and economic activities.

Option J: Amphitheater for gladiatorial combats. I don't think the Moche had gladiatorial games like the Romans or Aztecs. Their art and culture don't point towards that, so J is probably not correct.

So narrowing it down, the options that seem most plausible are B, C, and I. B suggests elite residences, which could be in the center, but I think the Moche were more focused on religious and ceremonial structures. Option C, Palace of the Painted Walls, sounds like a significant building, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, I remember reading about the Moche having large ceremonial centers with temples and plazas. Also, their artisans were integral to their society, creating intricate ceramics and metalwork. So a complex with both temples and workshops would fit well as the central feature of their urban centers.

So putting it all together, the answer is probably I: a vast complex of temples and artisan workshops.

The Moche civilization, flourishing in northern Peru from 100 to 700 AD, was known for its sophisticated urban centers. At the heart of these centers were structures that reflected their religious, political, and economic priorities. While options like elite residences (B) or the Palace of the Painted Walls (C) are plausible, the Moche were particularly noted for their ceremonial and artisanal activities. Their urban centers often featured large complexes dedicated to temples and workshops, which were central to both religious practices and the production of their renowned ceramics and metalwork. This aligns most closely with option I.

Answer: I
