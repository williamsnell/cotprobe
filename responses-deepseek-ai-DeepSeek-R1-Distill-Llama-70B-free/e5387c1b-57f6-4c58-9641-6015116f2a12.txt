Okay, so I've got this DNA question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem gives me the antisense (noncoding) strand of DNA as 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'. I need to find three things: a) the sense strand, b) the mRNA transcribed, and c) the polypeptide chain that's translated. The options are from A to J, but only A to I are listed here. 

Hmm, right. DNA has two strands: the coding (sense) and noncoding (antisense). The antisense is the one that's complementary to the mRNA, except for T vs U. So the sense strand would be complementary to the antisense, right? Wait, no. Actually, the sense strand is the same as the mRNA but with T instead of U. Or wait, no, the sense strand is the one that has the same sequence as the mRNA, except the mRNA is made from the antisense. Wait, maybe I should think this through.

The DNA is double-stranded. The antisense strand runs from 5' to 3', and it's complementary to the sense strand, which also runs 5' to 3'. When mRNA is made, it's transcribed from the antisense (template) strand, so the mRNA is complementary to the antisense DNA but uses uracil instead of thymine.

Wait, no, wait. DNA has two strands: one is the coding (sense) strand, which is the same as the mRNA (except T instead of U), and the other is the antisense (noncoding) strand, which is the template for transcription. So when the antisense strand is given as 5' ATG GAT ... 3', the sense strand would be complementary and run 3' to 5' because DNA strands are antiparallel. So to get the sense strand, I need to take the complement of the antisense and reverse it to get 5' to 3' direction.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The antisense strand is the template for mRNA. So mRNA is synthesized from the antisense DNA strand. So the mRNA will be complementary to the antisense DNA. So, for example, if the antisense DNA is 5' ATG 3', then the mRNA would be 5' UAC 3', but wait, mRNA is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, so it's complementary to the template.

Wait, perhaps I should take it one part at a time.

First, part a: the sense strand. The antisense strand is given as 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'. So the sense strand is complementary to this. Since DNA strands are antiparallel, the sense strand will run 3' to 5'. Wait no, wait. The sense strand is the non-template strand, which is same as mRNA (with T instead of U). So the sense strand should be complementary to the antisense but in the same direction? Or wait, no.

Let me visualize the DNA strands. The antisense is the template, which is 5' to 3' in the direction it's given. The sense strand is the other DNA strand, which runs 3' to 5', but when written, it's usually presented 5' to 3' as well, so we have to reverse complement.

So to get the sense strand, I take the antisense strand, reverse it, and take the complement of each base. So let's break it down.

Antisense (noncoding) strand: 5' A T G G A T A A A G I T T T A A A C A G A G A G G A A T C T 3'

Wait, but wait, the letters after GAT: AAA GIT... Hmm, wait, I think I might have to consider that the antisense is the template for mRNA, so the mRNA is complementary to the antisense.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the sense strand is the same as the mRNA but with T instead of U. So, if the antisense DNA is 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3', then the sense strand would be complementary to that, but in the 5' to 3' direction, which would be the same as the mRNA but with T instead of U.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to write the sense strand.

The antisense strand is 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'.

To get the sense strand, we need to take the complementary bases, but in the reverse direction because DNA strands are antiparallel. So the sense strand would be 3' TAC CTA TTT CAA AAT TTG TCT CTC CTT AGA 5'. But wait, when we present DNA strands, we usually write them in 5' to 3' direction. So the sense strand is 5' AGA GAG GAA TCT ... wait, no, let's do it step by step.

Wait, perhaps the easiest way is to reverse the antisense strand and then take the complement of each base. So reverse the antisense first.

Antisense: 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'

Reversed: 3' TCT GAA GAG AGA AAC TTA TIG AAA TAG GAT ATG 5'

Wait, but when you reverse the antisense, you get the complementary of the sense strand. So the sense strand would be the reverse complement of the antisense.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me take each part one by one.

Antisense DNA: 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'

To find the sense DNA strand, we need to create its complement, but in the 5' to 3' direction. Because DNA strands are antiparallel, the sense strand is the complement of the antisense, written in the reverse direction.

So for each part of the antisense, I'll write the complement in reverse.

Let's split the antisense into segments:

ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT

Let me write each triplet (codon) and find their complements.

ATG → complement is TAC (since A pairs with T, T with A, G with C, but wait, no, the complement of ATG is TAC? Wait A's complement is T, T→A, G→C. So ATG becomes TAC.

Wait, no: DNA strands are complementary, so the sense strand will have the same sequence as mRNA but with T instead of U. So the mRNA is complementary to the antisense DNA.

Alternatively, perhaps for the sense DNA strand, each base is the complement of the antisense but in reverse order.

Wait, another approach: the sense strand is the same as the mRNA, except T instead of U. So if I can find the mRNA, then the sense strand is just the DNA version of that.

The mRNA is transcribed from the antisense DNA, so it's complementary to the antisense.

So antisense DNA is 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'

mRNA is 5' [complement of each base] 3', so let's write that.

Each DNA base in antisense: A becomes U in mRNA, T becomes A, G becomes C, C becomes G.

Wait, no. mRNA is complementary to the antisense DNA. So for each base in antisense DNA:

A → U in mRNA
T → A
G → C
C → G
I → ? Wait, wait a second. Wait, the DNA has 'I'? Oh wait, no, I think that's a typo. DNA bases are A, T, C, G. So the given antisense DNA has a 'GIT' part, which must be a typo. Oh wait, maybe it's a typo for 'GTT'? Or perhaps it's a mistake because DNA doesn't have 'I'. So I'm a bit confused here. Let me look back at the question.

Wait, the antisense strand is given as 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'. So 'GIT' is part of it. Hmm, that's strange because DNA doesn't have I (inosine). Maybe it's a typo, perhaps it's supposed to be 'GTT' or 'CT'? Or maybe it's a mistake, and I should proceed assuming it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different base, but I'm not aware of I being a standard DNA base. So perhaps the correct antisense is 5' ATG GAT AAA GTT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'. Maybe the 'I' is a typo for 'T' in GTT.

So I'll proceed with that assumption. So the antisense is ATG GAT AAA GTT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT.

Now, the mRNA is complementary to this. So each DNA base is transcribed as:

A → U
T → A
G → C
C → G

So let's transcribe the mRNA.

Antisense DNA: 5' ATG GAT AAA GTT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'

mRNA (complementary): 5' UAC CUA UUU CAA UUA GUU CUC CUU AGA 3'

Wait, let me do it step by step.

ATG → UAC
GAT → CUA
AAA → UUU
GTT → CAA
TTA → UUA
AAC → GUU
AGA → UCU
GAG → CUC
GAA → CUU
TCT → AGA

So mRNA is 5' UAC CUA UUU CAA UUA GUU UCU CUC CUU AGA 3'

Wait, but mRNA is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, so the first codon would be UAC, which corresponds to the first part of the antisense DNA.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct mRNA is 5' AUG G... because the start codon is AUG. Hmm, wait, wait. Wait, in DNA, the sense strand would have ATG as the start codon. So the mRNA would have AUG as the start codon. So perhaps the antisense DNA's first codon is ATG, so the mRNA's first codon would be UAC, which doesn't make sense because that's a tyrosine, not a start codon. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The sense DNA strand would have ATG as the start codon, and the mRNA would have AUG. So the antisense DNA's first codon would be CAT, because the sense strand is ATG. Wait, I'm getting myself more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the options given. Let me look at the options.

Looking at option C: sense strand is 3' TAC CTA TTT CAA AAT TTG TCT CTC CTT AGA 5', mRNA is 5' AUG GAU AAA GUU UUA AAC AGA GAG GAA UCU 3', which starts with AUG, the start codon.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, the mRNA should have started with UAC. So perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the antisense DNA is the template, so the mRNA is complementary. Let's try again.

If the antisense DNA is 5' ATG GAT AAA GTT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3', then the mRNA is 5' UAC CUA UUU CAA UUA GUU UCU CUC CUU AGA 3'. But that starts with UAC, which is tyrosine, not a start codon.

Wait, that can't be right because the start codon in mRNA is AUG, which corresponds to ATG in the sense DNA. So perhaps the sense DNA starts with ATG, and the antisense has CAT.

Wait, perhaps I got the strands reversed. Let me think again.

The sense strand has the same sequence as the mRNA, except T instead of U. So mRNA starts with AUG, which is the start codon. So the sense DNA strand would have ATG as the first codon. Therefore, the antisense DNA strand, which is the template, would have CAT as the first codon (complement of ATG).

But the given antisense DNA starts with ATG, which would mean the sense strand starts with CAT, which can't be right because the sense strand should start with ATG as the start codon.

Wait, this is getting really confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the first part.

Alternative approach: the sense strand is the one that has the same sequence as the mRNA, with T instead of U. So, to get the sense DNA, I can take the mRNA and replace U with T, then write it in DNA's 5'→3' direction.

Wait, but the mRNA is made from the antisense DNA. So the mRNA is complementary to the antisense DNA. So if the antisense DNA is 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3', then the mRNA is 5' UAC CUA UUU CAA UUA GUU UCU CUC CUU AGA 3'.

But that can't be because the first codon would be UAC, not AUG. So perhaps the initial part is correct, but maybe the given antisense DNA is actually the sense strand? Or perhaps I have a misunderstanding.

Wait, no, the question says the antisense is 5' ATG GAT ... So perhaps the sense strand starts with CAT.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me look at the options.

Option B: sense strand is 3' TAC CTA TTT CAA AAT TTG TCT CTC CTTAGA 5'. Wait, that's the reverse complement of the antisense. So if the antisense is 5' ATG GAT ... then the sense is 3' CAT CUA ... etc. So when presented as 5' to 3', the sense would be the complement in reverse.

So the sense strand should be 5' AGA GAG GAA TCT ... etc., but that doesn't make sense because the first codon would be AGA, which is arginine, not a start codon. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me take the antisense DNA and find its complement, then reverse it to get the sense strand.

Antisense: 5' ATG GAT AAA GTT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'

Complement of each base: TAC CUA UUU CAA UUA GUU UCU CUC CUU AGA

Now, reverse this to get the sense strand in 5'→3' direction.

So reversing TAC CUA UUU CAA UUA GUU UCU CUC CUU AGA gives AGA GUU CUC UAG UU CAA UUU ACUAGTAC.

Wait, that's not right. Wait, I'm not doing this correctly. Let me write the antisense as a string and then find the reverse complement.

Antisense (5' to 3'): ATG GAT AAA GTT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT

Let's write it without spaces: ATGGATAAAGTTTAAACAGAGAGGAA TCT → Wait, perhaps I should write it all as one string: ATGGATAAAGT TTAAACAGAGAGGAATCT.

Wait, perhaps I should write the entire antisense as a single sequence. Let me do that.

Antisense: 5' A T G G A T A A A G T T T T A A A C A G A G A G G A A T C T 3'

Wait, assuming the 'I' was a typo and replaced with T, so it's GTT.

So the entire antisense is: 5' ATGGATAAAGTTTAAACAGAGAGGAATCT 3'

The sense strand would be the reverse complement, which would be 3' CTAGAAGAAGCTGTTTAACTTTTATGCTAC 5' ?

Wait, no. Let me take each base and reverse it.

The antisense is 5' ATGGATAAAGTTTAAACAGAGAGGAATCT 3'

The reverse would be 3' TCTAAGGAGAGCTGTTTAAAGTTTATGATGAT 5'

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write the entire antisense, then reverse it, then take the complement.

Wait, maybe it's easier to do it step by step.

Antisense: 5' A T G G A T A A A G T T T T A A A C A G A G A G G A A T C T 3'

Let's write the complement for each base:

A → T

T → A

G → C

G → C

A → T

T → A

A → T

A → T

G → C

T → A

T → A

T → A

A → T

A → T

C → G

A → T

G → C

A → T

G → C

G → C

A → T

A → T

T → A

C → G

T → A

Now, writing the complement: 3' T C C A T T T C A A C T T T A T T G C T C G C T T A G C A T 5'

Wait, that seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps I should write the entire antisense as a single string, reverse it, then take the complement.

Let's try that.

Antisense sequence (5' to 3'): ATGGATAAAGTTTAAACAGAGAGGAATCT

Reversed: TCTAAGGAGAGCTGTTTAAAGTTTATGATGAT

Now, take the complement of each base in this reversed sequence.

T → A

C → G

T → A

A → T

A → T

G → C

G → C

A → T

G → C

A → T

G → C

T → A

G → C

T → A

T → A

T → A

A → T

A → T

G → C

T → A

T → A

A → T

T → A

G → C

A → T

T → A

So the complement of the reversed antisense is:

A G C T C G A C G C A T T T A T G C T T A T G
