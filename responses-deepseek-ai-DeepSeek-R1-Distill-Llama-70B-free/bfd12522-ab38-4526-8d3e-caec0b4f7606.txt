Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with function transformations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the graph of y = f(x) has a certain property: if you shift it 20 units to the right, it looks the same as before. So, shifting right by 20 doesn't change the graph. Hmm, that must mean that the function is periodic, right? And the period would be 20 because after every 20 units, the function repeats its values.

Wait, actually, the fundamental period is the smallest period. So if shifting by 20 gives the same graph, but maybe a smaller shift could do the same. But the question doesn't specify whether 20 is the smallest such number. But I think for this problem, we can take 20 as the period because that's what's given.

Now, the question is about the function y = f(x/5). We're supposed to find the smallest positive 'a' such that shifting this new function a units to the right leaves it unchanged. So, we're looking for the period of y = f(x/5).

Let me think about how transformations affect the period. If you have a function f(x) with period T, then f(kx) would have a period of T/|k|. Is that right? Because when you replace x with kx, it's a horizontal scaling. So if k > 1, the graph is compressed, making the period shorter. If 0 < k < 1, the graph is stretched, making the period longer.

In this problem, f(x) has a period of 20. So for f(x/5), k is 1/5. So the period should be T / (1/5) ) which is T *5. So 20 *5 =100. So the period of f(x/5) is 100. Therefore, the smallest positive 'a' that would make the graph identical after a right shift is 100.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let's say f(x) repeats every 20 units. So f(x) = f(x+20n) for any integer n. Now, for f(x/5), if I shift x by a units, then the new function is f( (x - a)/5 ) = f( x/5 - a/5 ). For this to be the same as f(x/5), the shift inside must be a multiple of the period of f. So, a/5 must be equal to a multiple of 20. So a/5 =20*m, where m is an integer. To get the smallest positive a, m should be 1. So a =20*5=100.

So the answer should be G:100.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing transformations. The function f(x) is periodic with period 20, so f(x) = f(x+20). Then, when we have f(x/5), shifting the graph right by 'a' would mean replacing x with x - a, giving f( (x -a)/5 ) = f( x/5 - a/5 ). For this to equal f(x/5) for all x, the shift of a/5 must be a multiple of the original period of 20. So a/5 =20n, so a=100n. The smallest positive a is when n=1, so a=100.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is G:100.

The problem involves a function \( y = f(x) \) that is periodic with a period of 20 units, meaning \( f(x) = f(x + 20n) \) for any integer \( n \). The task is to determine the smallest positive \( a \) such that shifting the graph of \( y = f\left(\frac{x}{5}\right) \) by \( a \) units to the right leaves it unchanged.

For \( y = f\left(\frac{x}{5}\right) \), replacing \( x \) with \( x - a \) gives \( f\left(\frac{x - a}{5}\right) = f\left(\frac{x}{5} - \frac{a}{5}\right) \). For this to be identical to \( f\left(\frac{x}{5}\right) \), the shift \( \frac{a}{5} \) must be an integer multiple of the original period of \( f(x) \), which is 20. Thus, \( \frac{a}{5} = 20n \), where \( n \) is an integer. Solving for \( a \), we find \( a = 100n \). The smallest positive \( a \) occurs when \( n = 1 \), giving \( a = 100 \).

Therefore, the smallest positive \( a \) is **100**.
