Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see... A proton is at rest far away from Earth, and it falls toward Earth due to gravity. When it reaches Earth, all its kinetic energy is converted into a single quantum of light. I need to find the frequency of that quantum. Hmm.

Alright, first, I remember that when an object falls under gravity, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The proton starts from rest, so initially, it has gravitational potential energy. As it falls, that potential energy turns into kinetic energy. Then, when it hits the Earth, that kinetic energy is converted into a photon. 

So the key steps are: calculate the kinetic energy the proton has just before impact, then equate that to the energy of the photon and solve for frequency.

Let me recall the formulas. The gravitational potential energy (U) between two masses is given by U = - G*(M*m)/r, where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, m is the proton's mass, and r is the distance from Earth's center. Since the proton starts at rest far away, the initial potential energy is almost zero, so the change in potential energy is just U = - G*M*m / R, where R is Earth's radius.

The kinetic energy (K) gained will be equal to the loss in potential energy. So K = G*M*m / R. Wait, because the potential energy is negative, so the change is positive, right? So K = (G M m) / R.

Then, the energy of a photon is given by E = h*f, where h is Planck's constant and f is frequency. So setting K equal to E: h*f = G*M*m / R.

I need to solve for f: f = (G M m) / (h R).

Now, I should plug in the numbers. Let me remember the constants. G is 6.674×10^-11 N·m²/kg². Earth's mass M is about 5.972×10^24 kg. The proton mass m is 1.673×10^-27 kg. Earth's radius R is roughly 6.371×10^6 meters. Planck's constant h is 6.626×10^-34 J·s.

So putting all these together. Let me compute the numerator first: G*M*m.

G is 6.674e-11. M is 5.972e24 kg. m is 1.673e-27 kg.

So G*M = 6.674e-11 * 5.972e24. Let me calculate that. 6.674 *5.972 is approximately 6.674 *6 is about 40, but wait, 5.972 is 6 minus 0.028. So 6.674*(6 - 0.028) = 6.674*6 = 40.044, minus 6.674*0.028 ≈ 0.187. So about 39.857. But with exponents: 1e-11 * 1e24 = 1e13. So G*M is about 3.9857e14 m³/s² (wait, units? Hmm, maybe I should focus on the calculation first.)

Wait no, G*M would have units m³ kg^-1 s^-2, but let's not get bogged down with units right now. 

So G*M ≈ 6.674e-11 * 5.972e24 = (6.674 *5.972) * 1e13. Let me compute 6.674 *5.972. Let me do 6 *5.972 = 35.832, 0.674 *5.972 ≈ 4.023. So total is about 35.832 +4.023 = 39.855. So G*M ≈ 39.855e13 = 3.9855e14 (m³/s²? Not sure, but moving on).

Now multiply by m, which is 1.673e-27 kg.

So G*M*m = 3.9855e14 * 1.673e-27.

Let me compute that. 3.9855 *1.673 is approximately 6.674 (since 4 *1.673 is ~6.69, and 0.0055 *1.673 is about 0.009 so total ~6.7). The exponent part is 1e14 * 1e-27 = 1e-13. So G*M*m ≈6.7e-13 J·m.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, what are the units here? Because G*M has units of m³/s², and m is kg. So G*M*m is (m³/s²)*kg = kg·m³/s². Which is equivalent to energy multiplied by meters? Wait, no. Because energy is kg·m²/s². Hmm, maybe I messed up the units along the way. Maybe I should just proceed numerically.

So moving on. The denominator is h*R. h is 6.626e-34 J·s, R is 6.371e6 m.

So h*R = 6.626e-34 *6.371e6 = Let's compute 6.626 *6.371 is approximately 42.23. The exponents are 1e-34 *1e6 =1e-28. So h*R ≈42.23e-28 =4.223e-27 J·m·s.

Wait, but wait. The numerator is G*M*m =6.7e-13 J·m? Or maybe I'm getting the units wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the numerator as G*M*m/(R) and the denominator as h. So perhaps I should calculate G*M*m and divide by (h*R), but perhaps I should proceed step by step.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the entire equation:

f = (G M m) / (h R)

So f = (6.674e-11 * 5.972e24 kg * 1.673e-27 kg) / (6.626e-34 J·s * 6.371e6 m )

Wait, no, because G is in m³ kg^-1 s^-2. Let me check units to make sure everything cancels out correctly.

G has units m³ kg^-1 s^-2

M is in kg

m is in kg

R is in m.

h has units J·s, which is kg m²/s.

So putting the units into the equation:

Numerator: G*M*m → (m³/kg/s²) * kg * kg = kg m³/s²

Denominator: h * R → (kg m²/s) * m = kg m³/s

So f has units (kg m³/s²) / (kg m³/s) ) → (1/s²) * s → 1/s. Which is correct for frequency.

So the units check out.

Now, compute the numerator:

G*M = 6.674e-11 *5.972e24 = Let me calculate this accurately. 

6.674e-11 *5.972e24 = (6.674 *5.972) * 1e13.

6.674 *5.972: 

6 *5 =30, 6*0.972=5.832; 0.674*5=3.37, 0.674*0.972≈0.655.

Adding:

30 +5.832 =35.832; 3.37 +0.655=4.025. Total 35.832+4.025=39.857.

So 39.857e13 = 3.9857e14 m³/s².

Multiply by m (proton mass) 1.673e-27 kg:

3.9857e14 *1.673e-27 = (3.9857 *1.673) * 1e-13.

3.9857 *1.673: Let me compute:

3 *1.673 =5.019; 0.9857 *1.673 ≈ 1.649. So total ≈6.668.

So 6.668e-13 J·m.

Wait no, J is kg m²/s², so in numerator, the unit is kg m³/s². Hmm.

Denominator: h * R.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s, R=6.371e6 m.

So 6.626e-34 *6.371e6 = (6.626 *6.371) * 1e-28.

6.626 *6.371: 6 *6=36, 6*0.371≈2.226; 0.626*6≈3.756; 0.626 *0.371≈0.232. So total is 36 +2.226 +3.756 +0.232 =42.214.

So denominator is 42.214e-28 =4.2214e-27 J·m·s.

Wait, no, let me check exponents:

6.626e-34 * 6.371e6 = (6.626 *6.371) * 1e(-34+6) )= 42.214 *1e-28 =4.2214e-27.

So now, f = (6.668e-13 J·m) / (4.2214e-27 J·m·s) )

Wait, because the denominator is (h*R) which is in J·m·s.

Wait no, the denominator is h*R, which has units:

h is J·s, R is m. So h*R is J·s·m. But J is kg m²/s², so h*R is kg m³/s.

Wait, wait. Let's clarify:

h is 6.626e-34 J·s → units: kg m²/s.

R is 6.371e6 m.

So h*R → (kg m²/s) * m = kg m³/s.

The numerator is G*M*m = kg m³/s².

So f = (kg m³/s²) / (kg m³/s) ) =  (1/s²) / (1/s) )= 1/s. Which is correct.

So back to the calculation:

f = (6.668e-13) / (4.2214e-27) ) → 6.668e-13 /4.2214e-27 = (6.668 /4.2214) *1e14.

6.668 /4.2214 ≈1.58. Let me compute: 4.2214 *1.5 =6.3321. 6.668-6.3321=0.3359. 0.3359/4.2214≈0.0796. So total is 1.5 +0.0796 ≈1.5796.

So f≈1.5796e14 Hz.

Looking at the options:

A:2.2e14

B:0.8e14

C:1.0e14

D:1.2e14

E:1.8e14

F:2.0e14

G:1.6e14

H:1.9e14

I:2.5e14

J:1.4e14

Hmm. Our calculation is around 1.58e14, which is closest to option G:1.6e14 or option J:1.4e14.

Wait, 1.58 is closer to 1.6 than to 1.4. So perhaps G is the answer.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I computed G*M*m:

G*M = 6.674e-11 *5.972e24 = 3.985e14 (m^3/s^2) [Wait, no: 6.674e-11 *5.972e24 = (6.674 *5.972) *1e13 = 39.857e13=3.9857e14 m^3/s².

Then G*M*m =3.9857e14 m³/s² * 1.673e-27 kg.

So 3.9857e14 *1.673e-27 = (3.9857 *1.673) * 1e-13.

3.9857 *1.673 = Let me compute:

3 *1.673 =5.019

0.9857 *1.673: 0.9*1.673=1.5057; 0.0857*1.673≈0.1435. So total 1.5057 +0.1435=1.6492.

So total is 5.019 +1.6492=6.6682.

So 6.6682e-13.

Denominator: h*R =6.626e-34 *6.371e6 =6.626*6.371=42.21 (approx) and exponent 1e-34+6=1e-28. So 42.21e-28 =4.221e-27.

So f =6.6682e-13 /4.221e-27 = (6.6682/4.221) *1e14.

6.6682 /4.221 is approximately 1.579, as before. So 1.579e14 Hz.

So the closest option is G:1.6e14. But wait, option J is 1.4e14. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the numerator and denominator.

Alternative approach: Maybe using approximate values to make it simpler.

Let me approximate the values:

G ≈7e-11

M=6e24 kg

m=1.67e-27 kg

R=6.4e6 m

h=6.6e-34

Compute numerator: G*M*m =7e-11 *6e24 *1.67e-27.

7e-11 *6e24 =4.2e14. Then 1.67e-27: 4.2e14 *1.67e-27 = (4.2 *1.67) *1e-13.

4.2 *1.67 ≈7.014. So 7.014e-13.

Denominator: h*R=6.6e-34 *6.4e6= (6.6*6.4) *1e-28.

6.6 *6.4=42.24. So 42.24e-28=4.224e-27.

So f=7.014e-13 /4.224e-27 = (7.014/4.224) *1e14.

7.014/4.224 ≈1.662. So f≈1.662e14 Hz.

Again, approximately 1.66e14. So the closest option is G:1.6e14.

But wait, what if I used more precise numbers?

Let me compute G*M*m precisely:

G=6.67430e-11

M=5.972e24

m=1.6726219e-27 kg.

G*M =6.6743e-11 *5.972e24 =6.6743 *5.972=?

6 *5.972=35.832

0.6743 *5.972: 

0.6 *5.972=3.5832

0.0743 *5.972≈0.4439.

So 3.5832 +0.4439=4.0271.

So total 35.832 +4.0271=39.8591.

So 39.8591e13 =3.98591e14.

Multiply by m=1.6726219e-27:

3.98591e14 *1.6726219e-27 = (3.98591 *1.6726219) *1e-13.

3.98591 *1.6726219 ≈let's compute:

3 *1.6726=5.0178

0.98591 *1.6726≈1.6496.

So total≈5.0178+1.6496=6.6674.

So 6.6674e-13.

Denominator: h=6.62607015e-34, R=6.371e6.

h*R=6.62607015e-34 *6.371e6 =6.62607015 *6.371=?

6 *6.371=38.226.

0.62607015 *6.371=approx 3.99.

So total ≈38.226 +3.99=42.216.

So 42.216e-28 =4.2216e-27.

Now f=6.6674e-13 /4.2216e-27 = (6.6674 /4.2216) *1e14.

6.6674 /4.2216≈1.579.

So f≈1.579e14 Hz.

Looking back at the options, option G is 1.6e14, which is very close. But wait, option J is 1.4e14, which is a bit lower.

Wait, another thought: Did I forget to account for the negative sign in potential energy? No, because the change in potential energy when moving from infinity to R is positive, equal to GMm/R.

Another possible error: Did I mix up radius and diameter? No, because Earth's radius is about 6.37e6 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the kinetic energy. Oh wait, when the proton falls from rest at infinity, the kinetic energy at the surface is K=GMm/R. Yes, that's correct.

So I think my calculation is right, and the correct answer should be about 1.58e14 Hz, so option G:1.6e14.

But looking at the options, option J is 1.4e14. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents. Let me check the exponents again.

Wait, in the numerator:

G*M*m = (6.674e-11) * (5.972e24) * (1.673e-27)

So exponents: 1e-11 * 1e24 =1e13. Then *1e-27 → 1e13 *1e-27=1e-14.

Wait wait, that can't be right. Because 6.674e-11 *5.972e24 = (6.674*5.972) *1e13 → 39.85 *1e13 =3
