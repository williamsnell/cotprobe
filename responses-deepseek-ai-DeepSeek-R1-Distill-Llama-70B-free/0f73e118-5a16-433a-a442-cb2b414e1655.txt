Okay, so I've got this question about Mercury's orbit and its distance from the sun in terms of astronomical units (AU). Hmm, I remember that 1 AU is the average distance from the Earth to the sun. The question says Mercury orbits the sun in about one-fifth of an Earth year. I need to find out what its distance from the sun is approximately.

Wait, I think this has to do with Kepler's laws, maybe the third one. Kepler's third law relates the orbital period of a planet to its distance from the sun. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. But wait, since we're dealing with Earth years and AU, maybe there's a simpler version of the formula when using those units.

The formula I remember is P² = a³, where P is the orbital period in Earth years and a is the semi-major axis in AU. Yeah, that sounds right. So Mercury's period is 1/5 of an Earth year. Let me plug that into the formula.

P is 1/5, so P squared is (1/5)² = 1/25. According to the formula, that equals a cubed. So, a³ = 1/25. To find a, I take the cube root of both sides. The cube root of 1 is 1, and the cube root of 25 is... wait, what is the cube root of 25? Let me think. 25 is 5 squared, so the cube root of 25 would be 25^(1/3). Alternatively, maybe I can approximate it.

Wait, I know that 2.9 cubed is approximately 24.389, which is close to 25. So the cube root of 25 is about 2.924. Wait, no, wait, because 3 cubed is 27, so 25's cube root is a bit less than 3. Maybe around 2.9 or so. But wait, Mercury's distance should be less than 1 AU because it's closer to the sun than Earth.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Oh wait, no, wait. If P is 1/5, then a³ is 1/25. So a is (1/25)^(1/3). Wait, but that's the same as 1/(25^(1/3)). So 25 is 5 squared, so 25^(1/3) is 5^(2/3). Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 25 = 5², so 25^(1/3) is about 2.924. So 1 divided by that is approximately 0.342 AU. But looking at the options, I don't see 0.342 as an option. Let me look at the options again.

The options are A: 1/2 (0.5), B: 1/4 (0.25), C:1/25 (0.04), D:1/9 (~0.111), E:1/5 (0.2), F:1/3 (~0.333), G:1/15 (~0.0667), H:1/7 (~0.1428), I:1/10 (0.1), J:1/20 (0.05).

Wait, so 0.342 is closest to option F, which is 1/3 (about 0.333). But wait, I thought the cube root of 25 is about 2.924, so 1 divided by that is around 0.342, which is about 0.34 AU. So is that closer to 1/3 (0.333) or perhaps 1/2 is too big. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in applying Kepler's law.

Wait, another approach: I remember that Mercury's actual orbital period is about 88 Earth days, which is roughly 0.24 Earth years. Wait, but the question says it's about one-fifth, so 0.2 Earth years. Hmm, but Mercury's actual distance is about 0.387 AU on average. Wait, so if I use P = 0.24 years, then P² would be ~0.0576, and a³ would be 0.0576, so a is cube root of 0.0576. Let me calculate that.

Wait, but the question says the orbital period is about one-fifth (0.2) Earth years, so using the formula for that. So P = 0.2 years.

Then P² = (0.2)^2 = 0.04. So a³ = 0.04. Therefore, a = cube root of 0.04. What's the cube root of 0.04? Hmm, 0.04 is 4 x 10^-2. The cube root of 4 is about 1.587, and the cube root of 10^-2 is 10^(-2/3) ≈ 0.0464. So 1.587 * 0.0464 ≈ 0.0736 AU. But that doesn't match any of the options exactly. Wait, but that's when P is 0.2. But according to the question, Mercury's period is 1/5, so 0.2 years.

Wait, but then the a would be cube root of (0.04) ≈ 0.34 AU, which is about 1/3 AU (0.333). So option F is 1/3. But wait, when I plug in P=0.2, a³=0.04, so a≈0.34, which is closer to 1/3 than to 0.2. So the answer would be F:1/3.

But wait, earlier I thought Mercury's actual distance is about 0.387 AU, which is roughly 0.39, which is closer to 0.333 (1/3) than to 0.5 (1/2). So maybe option F is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because using P=0.2, a=0.34, but Mercury's actual semi-major axis is about 0.387 AU. But the question gives the period as one-fifth of a year, which is 0.2 years, but in reality, Mercury's period is about 0.24 years, so perhaps that's why the approximation is a bit off. But given the options, 0.34 is closest to 1/3, which is 0.333.

So among the options, the closest is F:1/3 AU. So the answer should be F.

To determine the approximate distance between Mercury and the Sun in terms of astronomical units (AU), we use Kepler's third law, which states that \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), where \( P \) is the orbital period in Earth years and \( a \) is the semi-major axis in AU. The problem specifies that Mercury's orbital period is approximately one-fifth of an Earth year (\( P = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \)).

Using the formula \( P^2 = a^3 \), we calculate:

\[
P^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04
\]

Thus, \( a^3 = 0.04 \), and solving for \( a \) gives:

\[
a = \sqrt[3]{0.04} \approx 0.34 \, \text{AU}
\]

This value is closest to \( \frac{1}{3} \, \text{AU} \) (approximately \( 0.333 \, \text{AU} \)) among the given options. While Mercury's actual semi-major axis is about \( 0.387 \, \text{AU} \), the question provides an approximate orbital period of \( \frac{1}{5} \, \text{Earth year} \), leading to this result.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**F: \( \frac{1}{3} \, \text{AU} \)**.
