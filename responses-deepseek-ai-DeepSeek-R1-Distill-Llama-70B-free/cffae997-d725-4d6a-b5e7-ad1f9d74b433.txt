Question:

If real GDP per capita grows at a rate of 10 percent a year then we can expect the standard of living to double in

D: 12 years.
E: 5 years.
F: 11 years.
G: 7 years.
H: 13 years.
I: 10 years.
J: 15 years.

Okay, so I've got this question here about real GDP per capita growth and how long it takes for the standard of living to double. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that there's a rule about this. Oh wait, it's the Rule of 72. Right, the Rule of 72 is a quick way to estimate how long it'll take for an investment or something growing at a certain rate to double in value.

So the formula, I think, is to take 72 and divide it by the annual growth rate percentage. In this case, the growth rate is 10 percent a year. Let me do the calculation. 72 divided by 10 equals 7.2. So that's about 7.2 years. But wait, the options don't have 7.2; the closest is 7 years or maybe 8.

Wait, sometimes people use the Rule of 70 for easier numbers, but I think 72 is more accurate. Let me think again. If it's 10% growth, then each year the GDP per capita is multiplying by 1.10. To find the doubling time, I can set up the equation (1.10)^t = 2. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, ln(1.10^t) = ln(2). So t = ln(2)/ln(1.10). 

Calculating that, ln(2) is approximately 0.693 and ln(1.10) is around 0.09531. So t ≈ 0.693 / 0.09531 ≈ 7.27 years. So about 7.27 years. Since the options are in whole numbers, the closest would be 7 years. Let me check the options again. Option G is 7 years, and option A is 8. So the answer should be G, right?

Wait, maybe I should double-check with another method. Like, using the Rule of 72 again. 72/10 is 7.2 years. So 7.2 is closer to 7 than 8. So yeah, the answer should be 7 years. That would be option G.

To determine how long it takes for real GDP per capita to double at a 10% annual growth rate, we use the Rule of 72. The formula is:

\[
\text{Doubling Time} = \frac{72}{\text{Growth Rate}}
\]

Here, the growth rate is 10%, so:

\[
\text{Doubling Time} = \frac{72}{10} = 7.2 \text{ years}
\]

Since the question asks for the closest whole number, 7.2 years rounds to 7 years. Therefore, the correct answer is:

G: 7 years.
