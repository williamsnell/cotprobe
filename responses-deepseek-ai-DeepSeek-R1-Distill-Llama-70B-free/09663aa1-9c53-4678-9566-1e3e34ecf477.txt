Question:

A man brought a federal diversity action against his insurance company, alleging that the company had breached its duty under his insurance policy by refusing to pay for his medical expenses resulting from a mountain-biking accident. At the jury trial, the man presented evidence that he had paid all premiums on the insurance policy and that the policy cov-ered personal-injury-related medical expenses arising from accidents. After he rested his case, the company presented evidence that a provision of the policy excluded payment for injury-related expenses resulting from an insured's Òunduly riskyÓ behavior. The company also presented a witness who testified that the accident had occurred in an area where posted signs warned bikers not to enter. The man did not cross-examine the witness. After resting its case, the company moved for judgment as a matter of law. Should the court grant the motion?

Options:

A: Yes, because the company's uncontradicted evidence of the man's unduly risky behavior means that no reason-able jury could find that the policy covers his injuries.
B: No, because the company did not provide sufficient evidence to prove that the man's behavior was unduly risky.
C: No, because the signs warning bikers not to enter were not part of the insurance policy.
D: No, because a motion for judgment as a matter of law must first be made at the close of the plaintiff's case-in-chief.
E: Yes, because the man failed to cross-examine the company's witness.
F: Yes, because the company provided evidence of a policy clause excluding unduly risky behavior.
G: Yes, because the man waived his right to rebut the company's evidence by not addressing the Òunduly riskyÓ policy provision in his case-in-chief.
H: No, because the man had paid all his premiums on the insurance policy.
I: No, because whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact for the jury to resolve.
J: Yes, because the man did not provide sufficient evidence to prove that the company breached its duty.

Okay, so I've got this question about a legal case, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully.

Alright, the situation is a man suing his insurance company in federal diversity court. He says they breached their duty by not paying his medical expenses after a mountain-biking accident. At trial, he presented evidence that he paid all premiums and that the policy covers medical expenses from accidents. Then the company, after he rested his case, presented evidence that a policy provision excludes coverage for injuries from "unduly risky" behavior. They also had a witness who said the accident happened where signs warned bikers not to enter. The man didn't cross-examine that witness. Now, the company has moved for judgment as a matter of law. The question is whether the court should grant that motion.

Hmm, I remember that a motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) is made when one party believes that no reasonable jury could find against them on a particular issue. So the company is arguing that even considering the man's evidence, they're entitled to judgment because their evidence shows the exclusion applies.

Let me think about the elements here. The man has the burden to prove that the policy covers his injuries. He presented evidence that the policy covers personal injuries from accidents, and he paid premiums. So he's met his initial burden.

The company then presents evidence that the policy excludes coverage for unduly risky behavior. They have a witness saying the area was marked with signs warning bikers not to enter, which suggests that the man engaged in risky behavior. The man didn't cross-examine, so that evidence stands.

Now, for JMOL, the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, which here is the man. So even if the company's evidence is strong, if there's any dispute in the facts, JMOL should not be granted.

So the key issue is whether the company's evidence is sufficient to show that the man's behavior was unduly risky as a matter of law, leaving no room for a reasonable jury to disagree. Alternatively, does the evidence present a factual dispute that the jury should decide.

Option A says yes because the company's evidence is uncontradicted, so no reasonable jury could find coverage. But wait, the man didn't contradict it, but maybe the evidence isn't sufficient. Or maybe the man's behavior could be seen differently by the jury.

Option B says no because the company didn't provide enough evidence. But the company did present a witness about the signs, which could indicate undue risk. So B might not be correct.

Option C argues that the signs weren't part of the policy. But the policy exclusion is about the insured's behavior, so the signs are evidence of that behavior. So C doesn't seem right.

Option D says the motion must be made after the plaintiff's case. Wait, no, I think a JMOL can be made after the defense presents their case as well. So D is incorrect.

Option E is about the man not cross-examining, but that doesn't necessarily mean the evidence is undisputed; it just means the man didn't challenge it. So E isn't the reason for granting JMOL.

Option F says yes because the company provided evidence of the exclusion. But just having the clause isn't enough; they need to prove the facts that trigger it. So F is probably not enough alone.

Option G suggests the man waived his right by not rebutting in his case-in-chief. But in a trial, each side presents their case, and the man could have chosen not to address it during his case but could still argue against it in rebuttal. So G doesn't make sense.

Option H says no because the man paid premiums. Paying premiums is a different issue; the exclusion could still apply regardless of payment. So H is not the right reasoning.

Option I says no because whether the behavior was unduly risky is a fact question for the jury. That makes sense because the company's evidence might not be conclusive. Even if there were signs, maybe the man had a reason to be there, or the signs were unclear. The jury should weigh the evidence.

Option J says yes because the man didn't provide enough evidence of breach. But the man did present evidence that the policy covers such expenses, so J is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the company's evidence might show that the exclusion applies, but whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact. The court can't take it from the jury unless the evidence is so one-sided that no reasonable jury could disagree. Since the man could argue that entering the area despite the signs doesn't necessarily make it unduly risky, or perhaps he had a justification, the issue remains a factual dispute. Therefore, the court shouldn't grant JMOL because it's up to the jury to decide.

The question revolves around whether the court should grant the insurance company's motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) in a federal diversity case. The man sued the company for breach of duty under his insurance policy after it refused to cover his medical expenses from a mountain-biking accident. At trial, the man presented evidence that he paid all premiums and that the policy covered personal-injury-related medical expenses from accidents. The company countered with evidence of a policy exclusion for injuries resulting from "unduly risky" behavior and presented a witness who testified that the accident occurred in an area with posted signs warning bikers not to enter. The man did not cross-examine the witness.

For JMOL, the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party (here, the man). The company's evidence, including the witness's testimony about the posted signs, suggests that the man engaged in unduly risky behavior, potentially triggering the policy exclusion. However, the man could argue that entering the area despite the signs does not necessarily constitute unduly risky behavior or that there were justifications for his actions. These are factual disputes that a jury should resolve.

Key analysis of the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. While the company's evidence is uncontradicted, it does not necessarily mean that no reasonable jury could find in favor of the man. The man could argue that his behavior was not unduly risky.
- **B**: Incorrect. The company provided evidence of the policy exclusion and the posted signs, which could sufficiently support their claim of unduly risky behavior.
- **C**: Incorrect. The signs are relevant evidence of the man's behavior, even if they are not part of the policy itself.
- **D**: Incorrect. A motion for JMOL can be made after the defense presents its case, so timing is not an issue here.
- **E**: Incorrect. The man's failure to cross-examine the witness does not automatically entitle the company to JMOL; the evidence must still be evaluated.
- **F**: Incorrect. While the company provided evidence of the exclusion, they must also prove that the man's behavior met the criteria for "unduly risky," which is a factual issue.
- **G**: Incorrect. The man did not waive his right to rebut the company's evidence by not addressing it in his case-in-chief.
- **H**: Incorrect. Paying premiums does not negate the potential application of the policy exclusion.
- **I**: Correct. Whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a question of fact for the jury to decide, as there could be reasonable disagreement about the interpretation of the evidence.
- **J**: Incorrect. The man provided sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of breach of duty under the policy.

The court should not grant the motion because the issue of whether the man's behavior was unduly risky is a factual dispute that the jury must resolve.
