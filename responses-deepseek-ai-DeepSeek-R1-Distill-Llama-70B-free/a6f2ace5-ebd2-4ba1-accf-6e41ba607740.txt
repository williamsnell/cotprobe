Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the decomposition of PCI5. Hmm, I remember that PCI5 can decompose into PCl3 and Cl2. The problem gives me an equilibrium constant K as 33.3 at 760 K. I need to find the percentage of PCI5 that decomposes when 1.00g is injected into a 500 mL flask.

Alright, let's start by writing down what I know. The reaction is PCI5 ⇌ PCl3 + Cl2. The equilibrium constant K is 33.3. The initial amount is 1.00g of PCI5, and the volume is 500 mL. The temperature is 760 K, but I don't think temperature affects the calculation directly beyond the given K.

First, I should calculate the initial concentration of PCI5. The molecular weight (M.W.) of PCI5 is given as 208.235 g/mol. So, moles of PCI5 = mass / M.W. That's 1.00g / 208.235 g/mol. Let me compute that.

1 divided by 208.235 is approximately 0.0048 moles. Wait, let me double-check: 208.235 is a bit more than 200, so 1/200 is 0.005, so 0.0048 is right. 

Now, the volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is moles per liter, so 0.0048 moles / 0.5 L = 0.0096 M. So initial concentration of PCI5 is 0.0096 M. 

At equilibrium, let's let x be the amount of PCI5 that decomposes. The ICE table would look like this:

Initial:
[PCI5] = 0.0096 M
[PCl3] = 0
[Cl2] = 0

Change:
PCI5 decreases by x, so [PCI5] = 0.0096 - x
PCl3 increases by x
Cl2 increases by x

Equilibrium:
[PCI5] = 0.0096 - x
[PCl3] = x
[Cl2] = x

The equilibrium expression is K = [PCl3][Cl2] / [PCI5]. Plugging in the values, K = (x)(x) / (0.0096 - x) = 33.3.

So, 33.3 = x² / (0.0096 - x). Let's rearrange this. Multiply both sides by (0.0096 - x):

x² = 33.3 (0.0096 - x)

Expanding the right side: x² = 33.3 * 0.0096 - 33.3 x.

Calculate 33.3 * 0.0096. Let's see: 33 * 0.01 is 0.33, so 33.3 * 0.0096 is approximately 0.31968. So:

x² = 0.31968 - 33.3 x

Bring all terms to one side: x² + 33.3 x - 0.31968 = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait no, I think I made a mistake. Let me check the expansion again.

Wait no, I think I messed up the sign. Because it's x² = 33.3*(0.0096 - x), which is 0.31968 - 33.3 x. So when moving everything to left side, it's x² +33.3 x -0.31968=0.

Hmm, solving this quadratic for x. Quadratic equation: a=1, b=33.3, c= -0.31968.

The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a).

Compute discriminant: b² -4ac = (33.3)^2 -4*1*(-0.31968) = 1108.89 + 1.27872 ≈ 1110.16872.

Square root of 1110.16872 is approximately 33.33 (since 33^2=1089, 34^2=1156. 33.33^2 = 1108.8889, which is very close to 1108.89, so sqrt is about 33.33.

So x = [ -33.3 ±33.33 ] / 2. We can ignore the negative root because concentration can't be negative.

So x = ( -33.3 +33.33 ) / 2 → approximately (0.03)/2=0.015. But wait, that would make x=0.015. But wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, let me re-calculate the discriminant more accurately. Let's compute 33.3 squared: 33.3 *33.3 = let's compute 33*33=1089, 33*0.3=9.9, 0.3*33=9.9, 0.3^2=0.09. So (33 +0.3)^2 = 33² + 2*33*0.3 +0.3²=1089 +19.8 +0.09=1108.89. So the discriminant is 1108.89 -4*1*(-0.31968)=1108.89 + (4 * 0.31968)=1108.89 + 1.27872=1110.16872.

So sqrt(1110.16872) is approximately 33.33, as before.

So x = [ -33.3 +33.33 ] /2 → (0.03)/2=0.015, and the other solution is [ -33.3 -33.33 ] /2 → negative, so we take 0.015.

Wait, but wait, this can't be right because when x=0.015, the denominator in the K expression is (0.0096 - x)= 0.0096 -0.015= -0.0054. That's negative, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in my setup.

Ah, I see the problem. Because the initial concentration is 0.0096 M, and x can't be larger than that. So if x comes out larger than 0.0096, that would be impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the ICE table.

Wait, maybe it's better to assume that x is much smaller than 0.0096, so the approximation can be made that 0.0096 -x ≈0.0096. But let me check if that's valid.

Let me try to compute K again without the approximation. My earlier approach led to a problem because x came out to be larger than the initial concentration. So perhaps I should not ignore the x in the denominator.

Wait, another approach: considering that K is 33.3, which is a relatively large value. So the reaction favors the products, meaning that a significant amount of PCI5 will decompose. So x might be a significant portion of 0.0096, so I can't ignore x in the denominator.

So going back to the equation: x²/(0.0096 - x) =33.3.

Multiply both sides by (0.0096 -x):

x² =33.3*(0.0096 -x) → x² = 0.31968 -33.3 x.

Bring all terms to one side:

x² +33.3 x -0.31968=0.

This is a quadratic equation in x. Using the quadratic formula:

x= [-33.3 ± sqrt((33.3)^2 +4*1*0.31968)] / (2*1).

Wait, wait, wait. Because the equation is x² +33.3x -0.31968=0, so a=1, b=33.3, c= -0.31968.

So discriminant D = b² -4ac = (33.3)^2 -4*(1)*(-0.31968)= 1108.89 +1.27872= 1110.16872.

So sqrt(D)=√1110.16872 ≈33.33.

So x= [-33.3 ±33.33]/2.

We take the positive root: (-33.3 +33.33)/2= (0.03)/2=0.015.

So x=0.015 M. But wait, initial concentration is 0.0096 M, so 0.015 is greater than 0.0096, which is impossible because you can't have negative concentration. That suggests that my assumption is wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, that can't happen. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I should have set up the equation correctly. Let me double-check the K expression.

Yes, K= [PCl3][Cl2]/[PCI5] = x²/(0.0096 -x) =33.3.

So when I solve x²=33.3*(0.0096 -x).

Which gives x²=0.31968 -33.3x →x² +33.3x -0.31968=0.

Which is what I did before. So the solution suggests x=0.015 M, but that's larger than initial concentration, which is 0.0096 M. So that's impossible. So that suggests that perhaps the assumption that x is small is invalid, or perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. The reaction is 1 mole of PCI5 decomposing into 1 mole of PCl3 and 1 mole of Cl2. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that K is 33.3, which is a large value, suggesting that the reaction goes almost to completion. So perhaps the assumption that x is about 0.0096 is valid. But then, in that case, 0.0096 -x would approach zero, which would make K very large, which aligns with K being 33.3.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by assuming that x is approximately 0.0096, but let's see.

Wait, let me try to solve the equation without approximations. So x²/(0.0096 -x) =33.3.

Let me rearrange this as x² =33.3*(0.0096 -x).

Which gives x² =0.31968 -33.3x.

Bringing all terms to left: x² +33.3x -0.31968=0.

Using the quadratic formula again, but perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, the discriminant is D = 33.3² +4*1*0.31968.

Wait, because c is negative, so -4ac is positive. So D = 1108.89 +1.27872= 1110.16872.

Square root of that is 33.33.

So x = [-33.3 ±33.33]/(2).

Positive solution: (0.03)/2=0.015. But this is larger than 0.0096, which is impossible. So this suggests that under these conditions, the reaction goes to completion, meaning that all the PCI5 decomposes, but that can't be right because K is 33.3, which is large but not extremely so.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the initial moles are very small. Let's compute the initial moles again.

Molar mass of PCI5 is 208.235 g/mol. So 1.00g is 1/208.235 = approx 0.0048 moles. Volume is 0.5 L, so initial concentration is 0.0096 M, correct.

So if x is 0.0096, then [PCI5] would be zero, which would make K infinite. But K is 33.3, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should let the change be y instead of x. Maybe I should consider that [PCI5] at equilibrium is y, and [PCl3] and [Cl2] are both equal to (0.0096 - y). Wait no, because for every mole of PCI5 that decomposes, you get one mole of PCl3 and one of Cl2. So if initially, [PCI5]=0.0096, and y is the amount that remains, then decomposed is 0.0096 - y. So [PCl3] = [Cl2] = (0.0096 - y).

Wait, perhaps that's a better way to set it up. Let me try that.

So, at equilibrium:

[PCI5] = y

[PCl3] = (0.0096 - y)

[Cl2] = (0.0096 - y)

So the K expression is:

K = (0.0096 - y)^2 / y =33.3.

So, (0.0096 - y)^2 =33.3 y.

Expanding (0.0096 - y)^2: 0.0096² - 2*0.0096 y + y² = 92.16e-6 -0.0192 y + y².

So, y² -0.0192 y +92.16e-6 =33.3 y.

Bring all terms to left:

y² -0.0192 y +92.16e-6 -33.3 y =0 → y² -33.3192 y +92.16e-6=0.

This is a quadratic in y. So a=1, b= -33.3192, c=92.16e-6.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (33.3192)^2 -4*1*(92.16e-6).

Compute 33.3192^2: approximately 33^2=1089, 0.3192^2≈0.1018, cross terms 2*33*0.3192≈21.14. So total approximately 1089 +21.14 +0.1018≈1110.24.

Wait, more accurately, 33.3192 *33.3192:

Let me compute 33 *33 =1089.

33 *0.3192 = 10.5236.

0.3192 *33=10.5236.

0.3192^2≈0.1018.

So (33 +0.3192)^2 =33² + 2*33*0.3192 +0.3192²=1089 +21.0472 +0.1018≈1110.149.

So D=1110.149 -4*92.16e-6.

Compute 4*92.16e-6=368.64e-6=0.00036864.

So D≈1110.149 -0.00036864≈1110.1486.

Square root of D is approximately sqrt(1110.1486)= about 33.33 (since 33.33²=1110.8889, which is a bit higher, but close).

So sqrt(D)=33.33.

So y = [33.3192 ±33.33]/2.

Taking the positive root:

y= [33.3192 +33.33]/2 ≈ (66.6492)/2≈33.3246. But that's not possible because y is a concentration and can't exceed the initial 0.0096.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I should take the other root: [33.3192 -33.33]/2 = ( -0.0108 )/2= -0.0054. But negative concentration isn't possible. So this suggests that there's no solution, which can't be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. The problem is that K is large, so the reaction goes almost to completion, meaning that y is very small. So perhaps I should assume that y is negligible compared to 0.0096, but even so, let's try to proceed.

Wait, perhaps I should approximate. Let's assume that y is much smaller than 0.0096, so 0.0096 - y ≈0.0096. Then, the K expression becomes:

K ≈ (0.0096)^2 / y =33.3 → y= (0.0096)^2 /33.3.

Compute 0.0096^2: 0.00009216.

Divide by 33.3: 0.00009216 /33.3 ≈ 2.77e-6.

So y≈2.77e-6 M.

Then, the amount decomposed is 0.0096 - y ≈0.0096 M.

So the percentage decomposed is (0.0096 - y)/initial concentration *100.

But initial concentration is 0.0096, so (0.0096 - y)/0.0096 *100 ≈ (1 - y/0.0096)*100.

Since y is 2.77e-6, y/0.0096≈2.77e-6 /0.0096≈2.885e-4.

So 1 - 0.0002885≈0.99971.

So percentage decomposed is 99.971%, which is approximately 99.97% or 99.99%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 99.9% dissociated. So that's one of the choices.

But wait, I thought earlier that when I set x=0.015, which was impossible, but now with this approach, I get that nearly all of the PCI5 decomposes.

But wait, let me think again. If K is 33.3, which is a fairly large value, the reaction strongly favors products, so most of the PCI5 should decompose. So getting nearly 100% decomposition makes sense.

So the percentage decomposition is approximately 99.9%.

Looking at the options, option H is 99.9% dissociated.
</think>

To determine the percentage of PCI₅ that decomposes, we start with the reaction:

\[
\text{PCI}_5 \rightleftharpoons \text{PCl}_3 + \text{Cl}_2
\]

The equilibrium constant is given as \( K = 33.3 \) at 760 K. Initially, 1.00 g of PCI₅ is injected into a 500 mL flask. The molecular weight of PCI₅ is 208.235 g/mol, so the initial moles of PCI₅ are:

\[
\text{Moles of PCI}_5 = \frac{1.00}{208.235} \approx 0.0048 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The initial concentration of
