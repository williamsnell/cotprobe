Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrostatic force between two point charges. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Alright, the question says: what's the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two 1.00 C point charges separated by 1.00 meter? And the options are from A to J.

Wait, I remember that the formula for the electrostatic force is Coulomb's Law. Yeah, Coulomb's Law is F equals k times the product of the charges divided by the distance squared. Oh right, the formula is F = k * (q1 * q2) / r².

So the charges here are both 1.00 C each. And the distance r is 1.00 m. Let me plug those into the formula. 

Wait, what's the value of k? Coulomb's constant. I think it's 8.99 times 10^9 N·m²/C². Yeah, that's right. So k is approximately 9e9, but maybe I should use the exact value for precise calculation.

So substituting the values: F = (8.99e9) * (1.00 C * 1.00 C) / (1.00 m)^2. Let's compute that.

The numerator would be 8.99e9 multiplied by 1, which is 8.99e9. The denominator is 1 squared, so 1. So F equals 8.99e9 N. 

Looking at the options, option I is 8.99e9 N. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check the options. Option A is 7.99e9, which is a bit lower. Oh, maybe someone might think k is 9e9, which would give 9e9, but none of the options have exactly that. Wait, option E is 10e9, option I is 8.99e9. So I think I is correct.

Wait another thought: Are the charges both positive or opposite? The problem says "magnitude", so the sign doesn't matter. So the magnitude is the same regardless of whether they're both positive or opposite. So yeah, 8.99e9 N is the right answer.

To determine the magnitude of the electrostatic force between two 1.00 C point charges separated by a distance of 1.00 m, we use Coulomb's Law:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{q_1 \cdot q_2}{r^2}
\]

Here:
- \( k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \) (Coulomb's constant),
- \( q_1 = q_2 = 1.00 \, \mathrm{C} \),
- \( r = 1.00 \, \mathrm{m} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
F = (8.99 \times 10^9) \cdot \frac{(1.00)(1.00)}{(1.00)^2} = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N}.
\]

The magnitude of the force is \( 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N} \), which corresponds to option I.
