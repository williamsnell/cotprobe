Okay, so I've got this question here about neural networks and the ResNet models. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The question has two statements. Statement 1 says that industrial-scale neural networks are normally trained on CPUs, not GPUs. Statement 2 claims that the ResNet-50 model has over 1 billion parameters. I need to evaluate whether each statement is true or false and then pick the correct option from A to J.

Starting with Statement 1. I remember that GPUs are much better for parallel processing tasks, which is exactly what training neural networks requires. CPUs are good for sequential tasks, but when you have a lot of data and complex computations like matrix multiplications in neural networks, GPUs can handle them much faster. So big companies and researchers probably use GPUs for training. That would make Statement 1 false because it's the opposite of what's true.

Now, Statement 2 is about ResNet-50 having over a billion parameters. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers, but I think ResNet models vary in size. ResNet-50 is a commonly used model. Let me try to recall: I think ResNet-50 has around 25 million parameters, not a billion. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Or maybe I'm mixing it up with another model. Oh wait, maybe I should think about the structure. ResNet uses residual blocks with skip connections. Each block has a certain number of layers. ResNet-50 has 50 layers, but the number of parameters depends on the number of filters and layers.

Wait, I think ResNet-50 actually has around 25.6 million parameters. So that's way less than a billion. So Statement 2 is false. Oh wait, wait. Did I get that right? Because sometimes people confuse parameters with FLOPS. Like, training a model might involve billions of operations, but the number of parameters is different. So yes, ResNet-50 doesn't have a billion parameters. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but then looking at the options, let's see. The options are about whether each statement is true or false, and sometimes specify for which model.

So Statement 1: False (since GPUs are used, not CPUs).
Statement 2: False (ResNet-50 doesn't have over 1B params).

Looking at the options, option J is False, True. But wait, that would mean Statement 1 is False (correct) and Statement 2 is True (which I just thought is incorrect). So J isn't right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Oh wait, maybe I'm thinking of ResNet-101 or ResNet-152. Let me think: ResNet-50 has 50 layers. Each residual block has two 3x3 conv layers. The initial layers might have 64 filters, then increasing. Let's see, the formula for parameters is a bit involved, but I think ResNet-50 is in the tens of millions, not billions.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with something else. Oh wait, perhaps larger models like ResNet-200 or something else. But the question is about ResNet-50. So Statement 2 is false.

So both statements are false. Wait, the question is evaluating Statement 1 and Statement 2.

So Statement 1: Industrial-scale neural networks are normally trained on CPUs, not GPUs. As I thought earlier, that's false because GPUs are used.

Statement 2: ResNet-50 has over 1 billion parameters. Also false.

So both statements are false. Now, looking at the options, which option says both are false. Looking at the options:

Option G: False, False. That would mean both statements are false.

Wait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake with Statement 2.

Wait, another approach: ResNet-50 has about 25.6 million parameters, as I thought. So over a billion would be 1e9, which is way higher. So Statement 2 is false.

So both statements are false. So the correct option is G: False, False.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is "False, False". So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait the options again. Let me list them:

A: False, True for ResNet-101 only
B: True, True for ResNet-152 only
C: False, False for ResNet-101 only
D: True, True
E: True, False for ResNet-101 only
F: False, False for ResNet-152 only
G: False, False
H: True, False
I: True, True for ResNet-101 only
J: False, True

So the correct answer is G: False, False. Because both statements are false.

Statement 1 claims that industrial-scale neural networks are normally trained on CPUs, not GPUs. This is false because GPUs are preferred for training neural networks due to their superior parallel processing capabilities compared to CPUs, which are better suited for sequential tasks.

Statement 2 asserts that the ResNet-50 model has over 1 billion parameters. This is also false, as ResNet-50 has approximately 25.6 million parameters, far less than 1 billion.

Since both statements are false, the correct answer is:

G: False, False.

Answer: G
