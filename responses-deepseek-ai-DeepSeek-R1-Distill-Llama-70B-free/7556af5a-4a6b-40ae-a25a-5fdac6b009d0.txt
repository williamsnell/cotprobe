Question:

Discuss the influence of heredity on emotionalresponsivity for both animals and humans.

Options:

A: Heredity has no impact on emotional responsivity
B: Heredity provides a predisposition for emotional responsivity, but it is ultimately shaped by early childhood experiences
C: Heredity influences only basic emotions, while complex emotions are entirely learned
D: Emotional responsivity is not inherited, but learned
E: Environment solely influences emotional responsivity
F: Heredity is influential in emotional responsivity, as seen in animal and human studies demonstrating genetic influence on emotional reactions
G: Emotional responsivity is equally determined by heredity and environment with no variation among individuals
H: Emotional responsivity is a random process, not influenced by heredity or environment
I: Heredity determines emotional responsivity completely, with no role for the environment
J: Emotional responsivity is determined solely by individual learning experiences, with heredity playing no role

Okay, so I've got this question about the influence of heredity on emotional responsivity in both animals and humans. Hmm, I remember from my psychology classes that this is a nature vs. nurture kind of topic. Let me think through this.

The question is asking about heredity's role. I think heredity refers to genetics, right? So, do our genes influence how we respond emotionally? I recall that twin and family studies have shown that some aspects of personality and emotional responses are heritable. Like, certain traits have a genetic component. But wait, it's not all or nothing, right? Environment plays a role too.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says heredity has no impact. That seems off because I remember reading that genetics do play a part. So A is probably wrong.

Option B suggests heredity gives a predisposition but early experiences shape it. That sounds more like an interaction between nature and nurture. It makes sense because, for example, a child might have a temperament that's more sensitive, but their upbringing influences how that develops.

Option C says heredity affects only basic emotions, and complex ones are learned. Basic emotions like fear, anger, happiness are universal and probably have an evolutionary basis, so maybe they're more influenced by genetics. But complex emotions like guilt or loveâ€”do those come solely from learning? I'm not sure. It might be an oversimplification because even complex emotions could have some genetic predispositions in how they're expressed or experienced.

Option D claims emotional responsivity isn't inherited but learned. That contradicts what I thought earlier about twin studies showing some heritability, so D is probably incorrect.

E says environment is the only influence. That's too extreme because it ignores the genetic factors we know exist. So E is out.

Option F states that heredity influences emotional responsivity, as seen in animal and human studies showing genetic influence. This aligns with what I remember. Studies on animals, like mice or primates, have shown that genetic factors affect their emotional responses, like fear responses or aggression. In humans, twin studies show heritability estimates for traits like neuroticism, which relate to emotional responsivity. So F sounds correct.

Option G claims equal determination with no variation. That doesn't make sense because people vary a lot, and the influence of heredity vs. environment can differ for different traits. Plus, it's rare for traits to be exactly 50-50. So G is incorrect.

H says it's random, no influence from either. That's not right because both factors do play a role, so H is wrong.

I suggests heredity completely determines it, no environment. That's too extreme. Even if there's a genetic component, experiences and environment shape how those genes are expressed. So I is incorrect.

J says it's solely determined by learning, no heredity. Again, this ignores the genetic evidence, so J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be F. It correctly states that heredity has an influence, supported by studies in both animals and humans, showing genetic factors at play in emotional reactions.

The question concerns the influence of heredity on emotional responsivity in animals and humans. Heredity, or genetics, plays a role in emotional responses, as evidenced by twin and family studies showing heritability in traits related to emotional responsivity. However, it is not the sole factor; environmental influences, such as early childhood experiences, also shape emotional development. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, D, E, H, I, J**: These options either ignore heredity entirely, attribute emotional responsivity solely to environment, or claim complete determination by heredity, which are overly simplistic or contradictory to evidence.
- **B**: Suggests heredity provides a predisposition but early experiences shape it, which aligns with the interaction between nature and nurture. However, it may not fully capture the scope of genetic influence.
- **C**: Implies basic emotions are heritable and complex emotions are entirely learned, which oversimplifies the complexity of emotional development.
- **F**: Correctly states that heredity influences emotional responsivity, supported by studies in animals (e.g., fear responses) and humans (e.g., twin studies on traits like neuroticism).
- **G**: Claims equal determination by heredity and environment with no variation, which is unrealistic given individual differences.

The most accurate answer is **F**, as it reflects the genetic influence on emotional responsivity while acknowledging the role of studies in both animals and humans.

Answer: F
