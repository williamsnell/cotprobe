Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it carefully. 

The question says that a child slides a block of mass 2 kg along a slick kitchen floor. The initial speed is 4 m/s, and the block hits a spring with a spring constant of 6 N/m. I need to find the maximum compression of the spring. The options are from A to J.

Hmm. I remember that when something like this happens, the kinetic energy of the block is converted into the potential energy stored in the spring. Oh right, the conservation of energy comes into play here. So I think I should start by calculating the kinetic energy of the block and then set that equal to the potential energy of the spring when it's compressed.

Wait, but wait. The block is sliding on a slick floor, so I guess friction is negligible. That means all the kinetic energy goes into the spring. But wait again, I remember that the potential energy in a spring is (1/2)kx², where k is the spring constant and x is the compression. 

So the initial kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Let me plug in the numbers. The mass m is 2 kg, velocity v is 4 m/s. So KE = 0.5 * 2 * (4)^2. Let me compute that. 0.5 * 2 is 1, and 4 squared is 16. So 1 * 16 = 16 Joules. 

So the kinetic energy is 16 J. Now, when the spring is compressed, this energy is stored as potential energy in the spring. So PE = (1/2)kx². I need to find x, the compression. 

The spring constant k is 6 N/m. So setting KE equal to PE: 16 = 0.5 * 6 * x². Let's compute the right side. 0.5 *6 is 3, so 3x². So 3x² =16. 

Solving for x squared: x² =16/3. Then x is the square root of (16/3). Let me compute that. Square root of 16 is 4, square root of 3 is approximately 1.732. So 4 divided by 1.732 is about 2.309 m? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, that would be if it's sqrt(16/3) which is 4/sqrt(3). But wait, wait, wait. 

Wait, 16 divided by 3 is about 5.333. The square root of 5.333 is approximately 2.309 m. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me check the options again. 

The options are A:3.5, B:3.2, C:1.0, D:1.5, E:4.0, F:2.6, G:2.9, H:0.8, I:2.3, J:2.0. Oh, option I is 2.3 m. That's close to what I got, 2.309. So probably, the correct answer is I.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I do that correctly? Let me double-check my math. Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv² = 0.5 * 2 * 16. Oh wait, no. Wait, 4 squared is 16, so 0.5 *2 is 1, 1*16=16 J. Correct. 

Spring potential energy is (1/2)kx². So 16 = (1/2)*6*x^2. 0.5*6 is 3, so 3x²=16. Then x²=16/3, which is about 5.333. Square root of that is indeed around 2.309. So 2.3 m would be the correct answer, which is option I.

But wait, another thought. I'm assuming that all the kinetic energy is converted into spring potential energy. But what if the block sticks to the spring and moves with it? Oh, but no, in this case, the block would just compress the spring until its velocity becomes zero, and then the spring would push it back. So the maximum compression occurs when the block's velocity is zero, which is when all KE is converted to PE.

So yeah, I think I did it right. So the answer should be I, option I: 2.3 m.

To determine the maximum compression of the spring, we use the principle of energy conservation. The kinetic energy of the block is converted into the potential energy of the spring at maximum compression. 

1. **Calculate the kinetic energy (KE)** of the block:  
   \[
   KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
   \]  
   Substituting \(m = 2 \, \mathrm{kg}\) and \(v = 4 \, \mathrm{m/s}\):  
   \[
   KE = \frac{1}{2} (2) (4)^2 = 16 \, \mathrm{J}
   \]

2. **Set the kinetic energy equal to the potential energy (PE)** of the spring at maximum compression:  
   \[
   PE = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
   \]  
   Substituting \(k = 6 \, \mathrm{N/m}\) and \(PE = 16 \, \mathrm{J}\):  
   \[
   16 = \frac{1}{2} (6) x^2
   \]  
   Simplify:  
   \[
   3x^2 = 16 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 = \frac{16}{3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \sqrt{\frac{16}{3}}
   \]  
   Compute:  
   \[
   x \approx \sqrt{5.333} \approx 2.309 \, \mathrm{m}
   \]

3. **Compare with the options**: The closest value to \(2.309 \, \mathrm{m}\) is \(2.3 \, \mathrm{m}\), which corresponds to option **I**.

Thus, the maximum compression of the spring is approximately **2.3 m**.
