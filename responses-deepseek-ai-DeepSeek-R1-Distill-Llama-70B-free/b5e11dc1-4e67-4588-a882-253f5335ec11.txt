Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two cylinders and their kinetic energies. Let's try to break it down. Alright, the question says both cylinders are homogeneous and made of the same material. They rotate about their own axes with the same angular velocity, omega. And the radius of one is twice the other. I need to find the ratio of their kinetic energies.

Hmm, I remember that rotational kinetic energy depends on the moment of inertia and the angular velocity. The formula is KE = (1/2) I ω². So if both have the same ω, the kinetic energy ratio depends on the ratio of their moments of inertia.

Wait, both are cylinders, so I should think about the moment of inertia for a solid cylinder. Oh right, the formula is I = (1/2) m r². But wait, the mass m comes into play. Since they're made of the same material and probably have the same density, the mass would depend on their volume. Volume of a cylinder is π r² h, assuming height is the same for both? Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the heights are the same. Hmm, but since both are made of the same material and homogeneous, maybe their heights are the same? Or perhaps they have the same mass? No, the problem states they have the same material but not necessarily the same mass. So I think each cylinder's mass would be proportional to their volume.

Let me think: For a solid cylinder, mass m = density * volume. Volume is π r² h. So m is proportional to r² h. But if the height h is the same for both cylinders, then m is proportional to r². But wait, the problem doesn't specify the height, so maybe I should assume that the length (height) is the same for both? Or perhaps they have the same mass? No, the problem doesn't say that. Hmm, maybe I should express the kinetic energy in terms of their radii and see how it scales.

Wait, the problem says they are made of the same material, so density is the same. Let's denote density as ρ. So for each cylinder, mass m = ρ * π r² L, where L is the height (assuming same height for both). But I don't know if the heights are the same. Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I should consider that the only difference is the radius. So maybe each cylinder's mass is proportional to r². But wait, if both are made of the same material and their radii are different, their masses would differ based on their volumes.

So the moment of inertia I is (1/2) m r². Substituting m as ρ π r² L, I becomes (1/2) (ρ π r² L) r² = (1/2) ρ π L r^4. So I is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but the kinetic energy is (1/2) I ω². So KE is proportional to I, since ω is the same for both. So KE is proportional to r^4.

But wait, the problem says the radius of one is twice the other. Let's call the smaller radius r, so the larger is 2r. So the KE ratio would be (r1/r2)^4, but wait, since KE1/KE2 = (I1/I2), and I is proportional to r^4.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let’s denote cylinder A with radius r and cylinder B with radius 2r. So for cylinder A, IA = (1/2) m_A r². But m_A is ρ π r² L. So IA = (1/2) * ρ π r² L * r² = (1/2) ρ π L r^4.

For cylinder B, IB = (1/2) m_B (2r)^2. m_B is ρ π (2r)^2 L = 4 ρ π r² L. So IB = (1/2) * 4 ρ π r² L * (4 r²) ?

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the moment of inertia for a solid cylinder is I = (1/2) m r². m is ρ V, and V is π r² L. So m = ρ π r² L. So I = (1/2) * ρ π r² L * r² = (1/2) ρ π L r^4.

So cylinder A has radius r, so IA = (1/2) ρ π L r^4.

Cylinder B has radius 2r. So IB = (1/2) ρ π L (2r)^4 = (1/2) ρ π L 16 r^4.

So IB is 16 times IA. So the ratio IA : IB is 1:16. But wait, the question is about the kinetic energies. Since KE is (1/2) I ω², and ω is same, KE is proportional to I. So KE_A : KE_B is IA : IB, which is 1:16.

Wait, but wait. The question is asking for the ratio between their kinetic energies. So if B has a radius twice as A, then the ratio of KE_A to KE_B would be 1:16.

But looking at the options, option G is 1:16.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check if I made a mistake in the exponents.

IB for radius 2r: (2r)^4 is 16 r^4. So IB is 16 IA. So KE would be IA and IB, so (IA) / (IB) is 1/16. So the ratio is 1:16.

So the answer should be option G, 1:16.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: The moment of inertia is proportional to m r², and m is proportional to r^2 (since m = volume * density, volume is π r² L, so m ~ r²). So I ~ r² * r² = r^4. So I goes as r^4. So if radius doubles, I scales by 2^4 =16. So kinetic energy, which depends on I, would scale as 16. So the cylinder with twice the radius has 16 times the KE. So if the question is about the ratio of KE1:KE2 where radius1 is r and radius2 is 2r, then KE1/KE2 is 1/16.

So the ratio is 1:16, which is option G.

To determine the ratio of the kinetic energies of two homogeneous cylinders made of the same material, rotating with the same angular velocity \(\omega\), we start by recalling the formula for rotational kinetic energy:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
\]

Since \(\omega\) is the same for both cylinders, the ratio of their kinetic energies depends on the ratio of their moments of inertia, \(I\). For a solid cylinder, the moment of inertia is given by:

\[
I = \frac{1}{2} m r^2
\]

where \(m\) is the mass of the cylinder and \(r\) is its radius. The mass \(m\) is proportional to the volume of the cylinder, which is \(V = \pi r^2 L\), assuming the height \(L\) is the same for both cylinders. Thus, \(m \propto r^2\), and substituting this into the formula for \(I\), we find:

\[
I \propto r^2 \cdot r^2 = r^4
\]

This shows that the moment of inertia is proportional to \(r^4\). Now, let the radius of the smaller cylinder be \(r\) and the radius of the larger cylinder be \(2r\). The moments of inertia for the two cylinders are then:

\[
I_1 \propto r^4 \quad \text{and} \quad I_2 \propto (2r)^4 = 16r^4
\]

Thus, the ratio of the moments of inertia is:

\[
\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \frac{r^4}{16r^4} = \frac{1}{16}
\]

Since the kinetic energy is proportional to the moment of inertia, the ratio of the kinetic energies will be the same as the ratio of the moments of inertia:

\[
\frac{KE_1}{KE_2} = \frac{1}{16}
\]

Therefore, the ratio of the kinetic energies of the two cylinders is \(1:16\).
