Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how long the NBA shot clock is. I've heard about the shot clock in basketball, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact time. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that the shot clock is the time a team has to shoot the ball after gaining possession. If they don't get a shot off within that time, it's a turnover. So the clock counts down from a certain number, and when it hits zero, that's when the violation occurs.

I think the NBA changed the shot clock a while back. Originally, I believe it was 24 seconds. But wait, was that the case? Or maybe it's different now. I'm a bit confused because I remember hearing something about it being reduced to speed up the game.

Wait, no, I think the standard shot clock in the NBA is 24 seconds. But I'm not 100% sure. I should consider the options given. Let's look at the choices again: A is 25, B is 18, C is 40, D is 45, E is 24, F is 30, G is 35, H is 32, I is 20, J is 28.

So E is 24, which I thought was the correct answer. But I also recall that in some cases, like when the ball is advanced to the frontcourt quickly, the shot clock might be shorter. Wait, no, that's more about when the clock doesn't reset the full time. For example, if there's a foul or a stoppage, the shot clock might reset to a shorter time, like 14 seconds, but that's not the standard.

So the standard shot clock is 24 seconds. Therefore, the answer should be E: 24 seconds.

Wait, but another thought: I've heard that in college basketball, the shot clock is longer, like 30 seconds. So maybe the NBA is shorter. But I thought the NBA uses 24 seconds. So E is correct.

Yes, I'm pretty confident the NBA shot clock is 24 seconds. So the correct answer is E.
