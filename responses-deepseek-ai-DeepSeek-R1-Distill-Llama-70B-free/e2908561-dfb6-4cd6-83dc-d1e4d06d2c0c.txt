Question:

An experiment is conducted in which the response variable is the average gain in participants' performance in the long jump. A two-sample t-test with a 5% level of significance will be used to analyze the results. If all else is kept the same, which of the following descriptions of a possible change in procedure is true?

Options:

A: Taking more careful measurements to reduce variability in the response would increase the power of the test.
B: Change from equal size treatment groups to very different size treatment groups would increase the power of the test.
C: Increasing the sample size would reduce the probability of a Type I error.
D: Change from a 5% significance level to a 1% significance level would increase the power of the test.
E: Changing from a two-sample t-test to a one-sample t-test would increase the power of the test.
F: Reducing the size of the treatment groups would increase the power of the test.
G: Increasing the variability in the response would increase the power of the test.
H: Changing the response variable to the median gain in performance would increase the power of the test.
I: Decreasing the sample size would increase the power of the test.

Okay, so I've got this question about statistics and hypothesis testing. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a two-sample t-test used in an experiment on long jump performance. The focus is on factors that affect the power of the test. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through each option.

The question asks which change would increase the power of the test. Power, as I remember, is the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. So, factors that make it easier to detect a true effect will increase power.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Taking more careful measurements to reduce variability. Reducing variability should help, right? Because if the data is less spread out, the effect might be more noticeable. I think that when variability decreases, the standard error decreases, making the t-statistic larger in magnitude if there's a real effect. That should increase power because the test is more likely to detect the difference. So A sounds correct.

Option B: Changing to very different group sizes. Wait, in a two-sample t-test, unequal sample sizes can affect the degrees of freedom. But does having unequal sizes increase power? I remember that the power is more influenced by the total sample size. If the sizes are very different, say one is much bigger than the other, the smaller group might have less precise estimates. Or maybe the test becomes less efficient. Or perhaps the power isn't much affected? I'm a bit confused here, but I think B might not be correct because unequal sizes don't necessarily increase power. In fact, they might decrease it because the smaller sample contributes more variability.

Option C: Increasing sample size reduces Type I error. Wait, Type I error is the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis. The significance level (alpha) is set by the researcher, like 5%. Changing the sample size affects power, not alpha. So increasing sample size should increase power, not affect Type I error. So C is incorrect because it's talking about Type I error, not power.

Option D: Changing from 5% to 1% significance level. Lowering alpha makes the test more conservative. The critical value increases, making it harder to reject the null hypothesis. So power would decrease because the probability of rejecting H0 when it's false goes down. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Switching to a one-sample t-test. Well, a one-sample test compares a sample mean to a known population mean. If the original was two samples, maybe the design is different. Whether this increases power? Not sure. Power depends on effect size, variability, sample size. If the two-sample is comparing two groups, changing to one-sample might not inherently increase power unless other factors change. I'm not convinced E is correct.

Option F: Reducing treatment group sizes. That would decrease sample size. I remember that lower sample size reduces power because the estimate is less precise. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Increasing variability. More variability would make it harder to detect a real effect. Because the standard errors are larger, the t-statistic is smaller, so power decreases. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Changing response variable to median. The t-test assumes normally distributed data. If the data is skewed, the mean might not be a good measure. Using the median could reduce variability if there are outliers. But wait, the t-test is based on the mean. If the response changes to median, perhaps a different test is more appropriate, but does that increase power? Maybe, but the question is about changing the response variable. However, the test remains a t-test, which relies on means. So I'm not sure; maybe H is incorrect.

Option I: Decreasing sample size. That definitely reduces power, so I is wrong.

So looking back, the correct answer is A: reducing variability increases power. Because lower variability makes the effect stand out more, making it easier to detect, thus higher power.

To determine which change increases the power of the test, it is important to understand that power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. Factors that enhance the ability to detect a true effect will increase power.

- **Option A**: Reducing variability in the response makes the effect more noticeable by decreasing the standard error, which increases the t-statistic's magnitude when there is a real effect. This increases power, so A is correct.  
- **Option B**: Changing to very different group sizes does not necessarily increase power. While it affects degrees of freedom, it can reduce efficiency and does not inherently enhance the ability to detect a true effect.  
- **Option C**: Increasing sample size affects power, not the Type I error rate, which is determined by the significance level (alpha). Thus, C is incorrect.  
- **Option D**: Lowering the significance level (e.g., from 5% to 1%) makes the test more conservative, increasing the critical value and reducing the likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis. This decreases power, so D is incorrect.  
- **Option E**: Switching to a one-sample t-test does not inherently increase power unless other factors change. Power depends on effect size, variability, and sample size, so E is not necessarily correct.  
- **Option F**: Reducing treatment group sizes decreases sample size, which reduces power by making estimates less precise. Thus, F is incorrect.  
- **Option G**: Increasing variability makes it harder to detect a real effect, as larger standard errors reduce the t-statistic's magnitude. This decreases power, so G is incorrect.  
- **Option H**: Changing the response variable to the median may reduce variability in skewed data but does not inherently increase power since the t-test relies on means. Thus, H is not necessarily correct.  
- **Option I**: Decreasing sample size reduces power, so I is incorrect.  

The correct answer is **A**, as reducing variability increases the power of the test by making the effect more detectable.
