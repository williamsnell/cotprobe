Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: X = A X + b u, with the initial condition X(0) = X0. The given matrices and vectors are A, b, and X0. Also, u(t) is the delta function, an impulse. Hmm, I remember this is a state-space equation, probably in control systems or something like that.

Wait, the problem mentions A is |10|, which I think is a 1x1 matrix with just 10. Similarly, b is |1|, so a 1x1 matrix as well. X0 is given as |-1|, |22, 2, 0|, but wait, that seems a bit off. Wait, looking back, maybe it's a vector with components [-1, 22, 2, 0], but that doesn't make sense because if X is a vector, then A should be a matrix that can multiply it. Oh wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says A = |10|, so that's a 1x1 matrix. Then X would be a scalar, right? Because A is 1x1. But then X0 is given as |-1|, |22|, |2|, |0|. Oh wait, maybe X0 is a vector with four elements: [-1, 22, 2, 0]? But that doesn't fit with A being 1x1. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a diagonal matrix with entries 10, and X is a vector. But the question says A = |10|, which I think is a 1x1. Maybe X is a scalar, so X0 is a scalar as well. Oh, but the way X0 is written has multiple numbers. Hmm, maybe that's a typo, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, let me read the problem again. It says A = |10|, b = |1|, X0 = |-1|, |-22|, |2|, |0|. Oh wait, maybe that's a list of possible X0 values? Or perhaps it's a vector with multiple elements. But if A is 1x1, then X must be a scalar. So perhaps the X0 given is a single value, maybe -1, and the other numbers are part of the problem but not part of X0. Or maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the notation is a bit off. Maybe A is a 4x4 matrix with diagonal entries 10, 10, 10, 10. But that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different notation where |10| represents a vector with elements 10, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the equation X = A X + b u. If X is a scalar, then A is a scalar, same with b and u. The equation would be X(t) = A X(t) + b u(t). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the time derivatives are missing. Oh, right, this is a differential equation. So it should be dX/dt = A X + b u(t). So the equation is a first-order linear differential equation.

Given that, and u(t) is the delta function δ(t), which is the impulse function. So the solution should involve the Laplace transform, perhaps. Let me recall: the Laplace transform of δ(t) is 1. So maybe I can take Laplace transforms of both sides.

Alternatively, for a linear time-invariant system, the response to an impulse is the system's impulse response, which is h(t) = e^{At} b, assuming A is in the denominator.

Wait, but let's get back. The state equation is dX/dt = A X + b u(t). The solution with X(0) = X0 is given by X(t) = e^{A t} X0 + ∫ (from 0 to t) e^{A (t-τ)} b u(τ) dτ.

Since u(t) is δ(t), the integral becomes e^{A (t - 0)} b * 1, because δ(t) is zero except at t=0, so the integral picks up the value at τ=0. So the solution becomes X(t) = e^{A t} X0 + e^{A t} b.

But wait, let me make sure. The convolution integral would be the system's response. So for u(τ) = δ(τ), the response is just the impulse response. So X(t) = e^{A t} X0 + e^{A t} b * u(0)? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of Laplace transforms.

Taking Laplace transforms: s X(s) - X(0) = A X(s) + b U(s). Since U(s) is 1 for δ(t), we have:

(s X(s) - X0) = A X(s) + b.

So rearranging: X(s) (s - A) = X0 + b.

Therefore, X(s) = (X0 + b) / (s - A).

Taking inverse Laplace transform, X(t) = e^{A t} (X0 + b).

Wait, but that can't be right, because the standard solution is X(t) = e^{At} X0 + e^{At} ∫_{0}^{t} e^{-A τ} b u(τ) dτ.

But with u(t)=δ(t), the integral becomes e^{A t} b.

Wait, perhaps the solution is X(t) = e^{A t} (X0 + b) ? Let me think. No, because the homogeneous solution is e^{At} X0, and the particular solution due to the impulse would be e^{A t} b, because the impulse is at t=0.

So X(t) = e^{A t} X0 + e^{A t} b. Which is e^{A t} (X0 + b).

Wait, but if X0 is a vector and b is a vector, then yes, that makes sense. But in our case, A is 10, a scalar, X0 is a scalar, and b is 1, a scalar. So substituting, X(t) = e^{10 t} (X0 + 1).

But wait, the initial condition is X(0) = X0. Let's check at t=0: X(0) = e^{0} (X0 +1) = X0 + 1. But according to the problem, X(0) is given as X0, so this would imply X0 +1 = X0, which implies 1=0. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake.

Ah, perhaps I messed up the Laplace transform approach. Let me try again. The equation is dX/dt = A X + b u(t). Taking Laplace transform:

s X(s) - X(0) = A X(s) + b * 1.

So s X(s) - X0 = A X(s) + b.

Bring terms together: (s - A) X(s) = X0 + b.

Therefore, X(s) = (X0 + b) / (s - A).

Inverse Laplace transform: X(t) = e^{A t} (X0 + b).

Wait, but that leads to the same problem as before. At t=0, X(0) would be (X0 + b), but according to the initial condition, X(0) = X0. So that would imply X0 + b = X0 => b=0, which it's not because b=1. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I should have subtracted the terms correctly. Let me redo the algebra.

s X(s) - X(0) = A X(s) + b.

So moving A X(s) to the left:

s X(s) - A X(s) = X0 + b.

Factor X(s):

X(s) (s - A) = X0 + b.

So X(s) = (X0 + b) / (s - A).

Inverse Laplace gives X(t) = (X0 + b) e^{A t}.

But as before, this gives X(0) = X0 + b, which contradicts the initial condition X(0)=X0. So this suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait a minute, I think I see the problem. The equation is X = A X + b u, but perhaps it's actually dX/dt = A X + b u. Because X is a function of time, so the equation must involve a derivative. That makes sense. So the correct equation is dX/dt = A X + b u(t).

So the Laplace approach would be correct, but then the solution suggests that X(0) would be X0 + b, which can't be right. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.

Wait, perhaps the correct solution is X(t) = e^{A t} X0 + e^{A t} * b * u(t) ?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Let me think again.

In the Laplace domain, the transfer function for the system is G(s) = b / (s - A), assuming no initial conditions. But when initial conditions are present, the solution would include the homogeneous part plus the particular part.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is X(t) = e^{A t} X0 + ∫_{0}^{t} e^{A(t - τ)} b u(τ) dτ.

Since u(τ) is δ(τ), the integral becomes e^{A(t - 0)} b * 1 = e^{A t} b.

So X(t) = e^{A t} X0 + e^{A t} b.

Wait, but that again gives X(0) = X0 + b, which doesn't match the initial condition of X(0) = X0.

Ah, perhaps the integral is ∫0^t e^{A(t-τ)} b u(τ) dτ. When u is δ(τ), this becomes e^{A(t)} b ∫0^t δ(τ) dτ = e^{A t} b (1), because the integral of δ(τ) from 0 to t is 1 for t>0.

So X(t) = e^{A t} X0 + e^{A t} b.

But then at t=0, X(0) = X0 + b. But the initial condition is X(0) = X0, so this implies X0 + b = X0 → b = 0, which isn't the case. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the system's response. Let me think again. The general solution is X(t) = e^{A t} [X0 + b ∫0^t e^{-A τ} u(τ) dτ ].

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is:

The state equation is dX/dt = A X + b u(t), X(0) = X0.

The solution is X(t) = e^{A t} X0 + e^{A t} ∫_{0}^{t} e^{-A τ} b u(τ) dτ.

Wait, that seems correct. So with u(τ) = δ(τ), the integral becomes ∫0^t e^{-A τ} b δ(τ) dτ = e^{0} b * 1 = b.

So X(t) = e^{A t} X0 + e^{A t} b.

Again, same result. So X(0) = X0 + b.

But initial condition says X(0) = X0, so this suggests that X0 + b = X0 → b=0, which can't be. So maybe the setup is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Let me check an example. Suppose A = 0, then dX/dt = b u(t). Then X(t) = X0 + b ∫0^t u(τ) dτ. If u is δ(t), then X(t) = X0 + b * 1 = X0 + b. At t=0, X(0) would be X0, but according to the equation, it's X0 + b. So same problem.

Wait, this suggests that the initial condition is applied after the impulse. So perhaps the initial condition is X(0-) = X0, and X(0+) jumps to X0 + b. But that's getting into distribution theory.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to treat the differential equation in the distribution sense. So the solution would be X(t) = e^{A t} X0 + e^{A t} b u(t). But that doesn't seem right because u(t) is a distribution, not a function.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is X(t) = e^{A t} (X0 + b u(t) * δ(t)) ). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using the Laplace transform correctly. Let me try again. The equation is dX/dt = A X + b δ(t), with X(0-) = X0.

Taking Laplace transform:

s X(s) - X(0-) = A X(s) + b * 1.

So (s - A) X(s) = X0 + b.

Thus X(s) = (X0 + b) / (s - A).

Inverse Laplace is X(t) = (X0 + b) e^{A t}.

But as before, at t=0, X(0) = X0 + b, which contradicts X(0) = X0. So this suggests that perhaps the correct initial condition after the impulse is X0 + b.

Wait, but the initial condition given is X(0) = X0. So maybe the system is defined for t ≥ 0, and the impulse is applied at t=0, causing an immediate jump in X.

So perhaps the solution is X(t) = e^{A t} (X0 + b) for t ≥ 0.

But then, the initial condition X(0) would be X0 + b, not X0. So perhaps the correct initial condition is X(0+) = X0 + b, and X(0-) = X0.

But the question says X(0) = X0, so perhaps that's the value before the impulse is applied. So maybe the solution is X(t) = e^{A t} (X0 + b).

In our case, A=10, b=1, X0 is given as... wait, the problem says X0 is |-1|, |22|, |2|, |0|. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe X0 is a vector with components [-1, 22, 2, 0], but earlier I thought A was 1x1. But now I'm more confused.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a single-variable system, so X0 is a scalar. But the way it's written in the problem is unclear. Let me read again:

"A = |10|, b=|1|, X0 = |-1|, |-22|, |2|, |0|"

Wait, maybe that's a typo and X0 is just |-1|, which would be -1. Then, the other numbers are perhaps distractors or part of another parameter. Alternatively, perhaps it's a multi-variable system, but A is a 4x4 matrix with each row being [10, 0, 0, 0], but that's speculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem was supposed to write X0 as a vector with those components, but given that A is 1x1, that doesn't fit. So maybe I should proceed under the assumption that X0 is a scalar, say X0 = -1.

So, with A=10, b=1, X0=-1, u(t)=δ(t).

So the solution would be X(t) = e^{10 t} (-1 + 1) = e^{10 t} (0) = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So X(t) would be zero for all t>0. Because the initial condition after the impulse is X0 + b = -1 +1 = 0, and then it evolves as e^{10 t} * 0 = 0.

So the solution is X(t) = 0 for all t ≥ 0.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.

But wait, maybe I should double-check. If X(t) = e^{10 t} (X0 + b), and X0 = -1, b=1, then X(t) = e^{10 t} (0) = 0.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer would be 0, which is option C.

The problem involves solving the differential equation:

\[
\frac{dX}{dt} = AX + bu(t),
\]
with the initial condition \(X(0) = X_0\), where \(A = 10\), \(b = 1\), \(X_0 = -1\), and \(u(t) = \delta(t)\) (the impulse function). 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Equation**: The equation is a first-order linear differential equation. The term \(u(t) = \delta(t)\) represents an impulse function, which is zero everywhere except at \(t = 0\), where it is infinite but has unit area.

2. **General Solution**: The general solution for such an equation is:
   \[
   X(t) = e^{At} \left[X_0 + \int_0^t e^{-A\tau} b u(\tau) d\tau \right].
   \]
   For \(u(t) = \delta(t)\), the integral simplifies because \(\delta(t)\) is nonzero only at \(\tau = 0\). This gives:
   \[
   X(t) = e^{At} \left[X_0 + b \right].
   \]

3. **Substituting Parameters**: Substituting \(A = 10\), \(b = 1\), and \(X_0 = -1\), the solution becomes:
   \[
   X(t) = e^{10t} \left[-1 + 1\right] = e^{10t} \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]

4. **Interpretation**: The term \(X_0 + b = -1 + 1 = 0\) indicates that the system starts at equilibrium after the impulse is applied. Therefore, the solution \(X(t) = 0\) holds for all \(t \geq 0\).

5. **Answer Selection**: Among the given options, the value \(0\) corresponds to option \(C\).
