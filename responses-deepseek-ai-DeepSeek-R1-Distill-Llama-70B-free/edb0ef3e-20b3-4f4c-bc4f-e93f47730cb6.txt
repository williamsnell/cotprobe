Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about dissociative disorders as listed in the DSM-III. My task is to figure out which option correctly lists these disorders. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the DSM-III is an older edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published before the DSM-IV and DSM-5. The question is about dissociative disorders specifically, so I should focus on what categories were included back then.

I think dissociative disorders involve a disconnection from one's thoughts, identity, or feelings. Common examples I've heard of include dissociative amnesia, fugue, identity disorder, depersonalization, and maybe some others.

Looking at the options:

Option I says: Five categories are listed in DSM-III: (1) psychogenic amnesia, (2) psychogenic fugue, (3) multiple personality, (4) depersonalization disorder, and (5) other dissociative disorders.

That sounds familiar. I recall that in older classifications, multiple personality disorder was a distinct category, now referred to as dissociative identity disorder in DSM-5. Psychogenic amnesia and fugue were also separate. Depersonalization is another classic dissociative symptom, so that makes sense. And having an "other" category is common in DSM for cases that don't fit the specific ones.

Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not getting this mixed up. Option E lists somatization and conversion disorders, which I think are part of the somatoform disorders, not dissociative. Option A is about sleep disorders, B is mood/anxiety, C is eating disorders, D is obsessive-compulsive related, F is about stress responses, G is sexual disorders, H is mood disorders, and J is psychotic symptoms.

So none of the other options seem to pertain to dissociative disorders except I. Therefore, I think the correct answer is I.

The correct answer is I, as it accurately lists the dissociative disorders from the DSM-III: psychogenic amnesia, psychogenic fugue, multiple personality, depersonalization disorder, and other dissociative disorders.
