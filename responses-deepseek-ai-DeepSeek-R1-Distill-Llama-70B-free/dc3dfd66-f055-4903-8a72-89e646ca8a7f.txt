Okay, so I've got this question about Engel's Law, and I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, but I remember it's related to how people spend their income on food versus other things. Let me try to think through this.

Engel's Law... I think it was proposed by Ernst Engel. The basic idea, if I recall correctly, is that as people's incomes increase, the proportion they spend on food decreases. So, when you make more money, you don't spend as much of your total income on food, but maybe more on other stuff like entertainment, clothes, or gadgets. 

Wait, but I should double-check. So, when income rises, what happens to the food proportion? It goes down. That makes sense because food is a necessity, and once you have enough for that, you spend extra money elsewhere. So higher income leads to lower percentage on food.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: As income declines, the proportion of income spent on food increases. Hmm, that seems to align with the reverse. If income goes down, you might spend a larger portion on essentials like food because you have less overall. So this could be correct, but I'm not certain if it's the exact statement of Engel's Law, which I think is specifically about rising income.

Option B: As income remains the same, the proportion on food increases. That doesn't sound right. Engel's Law is about income changes, not when it's static.

Option C: As income rises, proportion remains similar. No, that's opposite of what I remember. It should decrease, not stay the same.

Option D: Income same, food proportion declines. I don't think so; Engel's is about changes in income.

Option E: Income declines, proportion on non-food increases. Wait, if income goes down, people might spend more on food (a larger proportion), so less on non-food. So this might not be correct.

Option F: Income declines, food proportion declines. That seems opposite of A. If income goes down, you probably can't afford non-food, so you spend a larger portion on food, so F would be incorrect.

Option G: Income declines, food proportion same. Unlikely, because lower income would affect spending.

Option H: As income rises, proportion on food increases. No, I'm pretty sure it's the oppositeâ€”so H is wrong.

Option I: Income rises, non-food proportion declines. No, because when income rises, people spend more on non-food, so this would be incorrect.

Option J: As income rises, proportion on food declines. Yes, this sounds exactly like what I remember Engel's Law stating.

So the correct answer should be option J.

Engel's Law states that as income rises, the proportion of income spent on food declines. This is because food is a necessity, and once basic needs are met, additional income is allocated to non-food items. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct in the reverse scenario (income decline), but not Engel's Law.
- **B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I**: Do not align with Engel's Law.
- **J**: Accurately reflects Engel's Law.

Answer: J
