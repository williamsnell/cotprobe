Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the total gallons of water used by all the homes in West Valley. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

Alright, the problem says there are 2,817 homes, and each uses an average of 380 gallons a day. So I need to multiply these two numbers together to get the total. The expression given is 2,817 × 380. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on multiplying large numbers, but I'll take it slow.

First, I remember that breaking down the numbers can make it easier. So 380 can be thought of as 300 + 80. That way, I can multiply each part separately and then add them up. 

Let me start by multiplying 2,817 by 300. Wait, 300 is 3 times 100, so maybe I can first compute 2,817 × 3 and then add two zeros at the end because of the hundreds. 

Calculating 2,817 × 3: Let's do it digit by digit. 3 times 7 is 21, write down 1 and carry over 2. Then 3 times 1 is 3 plus 2 is 5. Next, 3 times 8 is 24, write down 4 and carry over 2. There's nothing left except the carried 2, so that's 2. So 2,817 × 3 is 8,451. Now, since I multiplied by 300, I need to add two zeros, making it 845,100.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check that. Oh wait, no, 2,817 × 300 is 2,817 × 3 × 100. So 8,451 × 100 is 845,100. Right, that's correct.

Next, I need to multiply 2,817 by 80. Hmm, 80 is 8 times 10, so I can compute 2,817 × 8 first and then add a zero at the end.

Calculating 2,817 × 8: Let's do it step by step. 8 times 7 is 56, write down 6, carry over 5. 8 times 1 is 8 +5 =13, write 3, carry over 1. 8 times 8 is 64 +1=65, write 5, carry over 6. Then 8 times 2 is 16 +6=22. So that's 22,5... let's see, the digits would be 22,5 6 3 6? Wait, maybe I should write it out properly.

Wait, 2,817 × 8:
- 7×8=56 → 6, carry 5
- 1×8=8 +5=13 → 3, carry 1
- 8×8=64 +1=65 → 5, carry 6
- 2×8=16 +6=22 → write 22.

So putting it together, it's 22,536. But wait, wait, no. Let me check again. Oh wait, no, because 2,817 is four digits, so 2,817 ×8:

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write it as:

  2817
×   8
--------

Starting from the right:
7×8=56 → 6, carry 5
1×8=8 +5=13 → 3, carry 1
8×8=64 +1=65 → 5, carry 6
2×8=16 +6=22 → 22

So the result is 22536. Now, since we're multiplying by 80, we add a zero, making it 225,360.

Wait a second, 80 is 8×10, so yes, 22,536 ×10 is 225,360. So now I have two parts: 845,100 (from 300) and 225,360 (from 80). 

Now I need to add those two together to get the total. Let's line them up:

845,100
+225,360
----------

Adding the units place:

0 + 0 =0

0 +6=6

1+3=4 (tens place)

5 (hundreds) +5=10, write 0, carry 1.

4 (thousands) +2=6, plus carried 1=7.

8 (ten-thousands) +2=10, write 0, carry 1.

Finally, 0 + carried 1 is 1.

Wait, let me add it properly:

845,100
+225,360
= (845,100 + 200,000) = 1,045,100
Plus 25,360: 1,045,100 +25,360 = 1,070,460.

Wait, that's 1,070,460. Hmm, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, 845,100 + 225,360.

Let me do it step by step:

845,100 + 200,000 = 1,045,100.

Then, add 25,360: 1,045,100 +25,360 = 1,070,460.

Yes, that looks right.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial multiplication steps.

Alternative approach: Maybe I can use another method to verify. Let's try multiplying 2,817 by 380 directly.

Another way is to break down 380 into 400 - 20. So 2,817 ×400 is 2,817×4×100. 2,817×4 is, let's compute that.

2,817 ×4:

7×4=28 → 8, carry 2
1×4=4 +2=6
8×4=32 → 2, carry 3
2×4=8 +3=11.

So 2,817 ×4 is 11,268. Multiply by 100 gives 1,126,800.

Now, 2,817 ×20 is 2,817×2×10. 2,817×2 is:

7×2=14 →4, carry 1
1×2=2 +1=3
8×2=16 →6, carry 1
2×2=4 +1=5.

So 2,817×2=5,634. Multiply by 10 gives 56,340.

Now, 380 is 400-20, so 2,817×380 = 2,817×400 - 2,817×20 = 1,126,800 -56,340.

Let me compute that: 1,126,800 minus 56,340.

1,126,800 -50,000 =1,076,800

Then subtract 6,340: 1,076,800 -6,340 =1,070,460.

Same result as before. So that's reassuring.

So the total is 1,070,460 gallons.

Looking at the options:

Options are A through J.

Let me look at the options again.

Option D is 1,070,460 gallons.

So the correct answer should be D.

To determine the total number of gallons of water used by the homes in West Valley, we need to calculate the product of the number of homes (2,817) and the average daily water usage per home (380 gallons). This is represented by the expression:

\[
2,817 \times 380
\]

### Step 1: Break down the multiplication
To simplify the calculation, we can break 380 into \(300 + 80\). This allows us to compute two smaller multiplications and then add the results:

\[
2,817 \times 380 = (2,817 \times 300) + (2,817 \times 80)
\]

#### Part 1: \(2,817 \times 300\)
- First, compute \(2,817 \times 3 = 8,451\).
- Since \(300 = 3 \times 100\), add two zeros to 8,451 to account for the hundreds:
  \[
  8,451 \times 100 = 845,100
  \]

#### Part 2: \(2,817 \times 80\)
- First, compute \(2,817 \times 8 = 22,536\).
- Since \(80 = 8 \times 10\), add one zero to 22,536 to account for the tens:
  \[
  22,536 \times 10 = 225,360
  \]

### Step 2: Add the results
Now, add the two parts together:
\[
845,100 + 225,360 = 1,070,460
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of gallons of water used by the homes in West Valley on average each day is **1,070,460 gallons**.

From the given options:
- **D: 1,070,460 gallons**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D**
