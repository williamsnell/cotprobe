Okay, so I've got this problem here about BennetBros. accepting a draft and getting it discounted. Hmm, I need to find the proceeds they get after discounting. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the details given:

- The draft is for $3000, dated March 15.
- It's due in 2 months after sight, and the sight was on March 30.
- They had it discounted on April 15 at a 6% rate.

Wait, okay, so after sight means that the two-month period starts from the date of sight, which is March 30. So the due date would be two months after March 30. Let me calculate that. March has 31 days, so adding two months... March 30 plus two months would be May 30. But wait, March has 31 days, so March 30 plus one month is April 30, and then another month to May 30. So the due date is May 30.

But the discounting happened on April 15. So the time between April 15 and May 30 is the period for which interest is calculated. Let's figure out how many days that is.

April has 30 days, so from April 15 to April 30 is 15 days. Then May has 31 days up to May 30, which is another 30 days. Wait no, from April 15 to April 30 is 15 days (including the 15th?), or 16? Hmm, wait, from the 15th to the 30th, inclusive? Or exclusive? I think when calculating days between two dates, we usually count the days from the start date to the end date, not including the end. Or maybe it's better to think of it as the number of days elapsed.

Wait, April 15 to April 30: the number of days is 30 - 15 = 15 days. Plus the 30 days in May up to the 30th, so 15 + 30 = 45 days. So the time is 45 days.

Wait, but sometimes in finance, they use 360-day years for calculations. So the interest would be calculated based on that. So the discount is 6% per annum. So the formula for the discount is (principal * rate * time) where time is in years.

So the time here is 45 days. To convert that into years, 45/360 = 0.125 years.

So the discount amount is 3000 * 0.06 * 0.125. Let me calculate that.

0.06 * 0.125 is 0.0075. Then 3000 * 0.0075 equals... 3000 * 0.0075 is 22.5.

So the discount is $22.50. Therefore, the proceeds would be the principal minus the discount, which is 3000 - 22.50 = $2977.50.

Wait, but let me double-check. The discounting date is April 15. The due date is May 30. So from April 15 to May 30 is 45 days. That's correct. So yes, the calculation is correct.

Looking at the options, option E is $2977.50. So that should be the answer.

The draft is for $3000, dated March 15, and due in 2 months after sight on March 30. This means the due date is May 30. The draft was discounted on April 15 at a 6% annual rate. The time period from April 15 to May 30 is 45 days. Using a 360-day year, the time in years is 45/360 = 0.125. The discount is calculated as:

\[
\text{Discount} = \$3000 \times 0.06 \times 0.125 = \$22.50
\]

The proceeds are the principal minus the discount:

\[
\text{Proceeds} = \$3000 - \$22.50 = \$2977.50
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**E: $2977.50**

Answer: E
