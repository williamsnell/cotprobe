Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about what predicts a child's post-divorce adjustment. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which factor is the best predictor in the two years following a divorce. The options are A to J, each with different factors. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Level of involvement of the non-custodial parent. I remember that having both parents involved is good for kids, but is it the best predictor? I'm not sure. Maybe consistent involvement helps, but maybe other factors are more important.

Option B: Age of the child at the time of divorce. I think younger children might adjust differently than older ones. But does age directly predict adjustment? I'm not certain. It might interact with other factors.

Option C: Degree of continued conflict between the parents after the divorce. Oh right, I've heard that ongoing conflict can really affect kids negatively. Even after the divorce, if parents keep fighting, the child might have more emotional issues. This sounds like a strong candidate.

Option D: Degree of hostility during the divorce process. Hostility during the actual divorce might matter, but does it continue to affect after? Maybe the ongoing conflict (option C) is more predictive over time than the initial hostility.

Option E: Residence with the preferred parent. I'm not sure about this. Maybe living with a preferred parent makes the child happier, but it's possible that other factors like conflict or support matter more.

Option F: Child's academic performance before the divorce. Previous performance could influence how they handle stress, but I don't think it's the best predictor. Maybe it's more about the environment after the divorce.

Option G: Financial status of the parents. Money can affect stress levels, but I've read that the emotional environment is more critical than financial status for the child's adjustment.

Option H: Withdrawal of the more disturbed parent. If a troubled parent isn't involved, maybe that's better for the child. But I'm not sure if this is the top factor.

Option I: Support from extended family. Family support helps, but again, maybe not the primary factor compared to direct parental conflict.

Option J: Frequency of contact with friends. Friends are important, but perhaps not as influential as family dynamics in the immediate post-divorce period.

So, thinking back, the key issue seems to be the level of conflict between parents after the divorce. Ongoing conflict can lead to more stress and adjustment issues for the child. So the best predictor is probably option C.

The best predictor of a child’s post-divorce adjustment during the 2 years following divorce is the degree of continued conflict between the parents after the divorce. This factor is more influential than others because ongoing conflict can create a stressful and unstable environment for the child, directly impacting their emotional well-being and ability to adjust. 

Answer: C
