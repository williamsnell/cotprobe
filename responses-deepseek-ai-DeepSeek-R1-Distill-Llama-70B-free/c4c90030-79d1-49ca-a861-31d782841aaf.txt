Okay, so I've got this problem about a shunt motor, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me a 15-hp motor at 220 volts, 1800 rpm, with 87% efficiency. The field resistance is 440 ohms. I need to find the full-load armature current and the torque. The options are from A to J, so I'll need to calculate both parts and match them to the options.

Alright, starting with part (a), the full-load armature current. I remember that in a shunt motor, the field current is separate from the armature current. The total current drawn from the supply is the sum of the field current and the armature current, but wait, no, in a shunt motor, the field is across the same supply as the armature, so the total line current is I_field plus I_armature. Or wait, no, maybe that's for series motors. Wait, no, in a shunt motor, the field winding is connected in parallel with the armature, so the current through the field is separate. So the armature current is the main current, and the field current is I_shunt = V / R_shunt.

So first, let's find the field current. The resistance of the field is 440 ohms, and the voltage is 220 V. So I_shunt = V / R = 220 / 440 = 0.5 A. Okay, so the field current is 0.5 amps.

Now, the total input power to the motor is the power supplied, which is voltage times the total current. Wait, but I have the output power in horsepower, and the efficiency. So maybe I can find the input power first.

The motor's output is 15 hp. Efficiency is 87%, so η = output / input → input = output / η. So output is 15 hp, which I need to convert to watts because volts and amps are in SI units.

1 hp is 746 watts, so 15 hp is 15 * 746 = let's see, 15 times 700 is 10,500 and 15 times 46 is 690, so total 11,190 watts. So output is 11,190 W.

Efficiency is 0.87, so input power is 11,190 / 0.87 = let me compute that. 11,190 divided by 0.87. Let's see, 11,190 / 0.87 ≈ 12,862.07 watts, approximately.

Now, the input power is also equal to the supply voltage times the total line current. Wait, but the line current is the sum of the shunt current and the armature current? Or no, wait, in a shunt motor, the armature and field are in parallel, so the line current is I_armature + I_shunt. But wait, no, wait: the armature current is I_a, and the field current is I_shunt. So total line current I_line = I_a + I_shunt.

But the input power is V * I_line. So:

Input power = V * (I_a + I_shunt)

We have V=220, I_shunt=0.5, and input power≈12,862 W.

So 12,862 = 220 * (I_a + 0.5)

Let me solve for I_a:

I_a + 0.5 = 12,862 / 220 ≈ 58.46 A

So I_a ≈ 58.46 - 0.5 = 57.96 A.

Wait, that's the armature current. So part (a) is approximately 57.96 A.

Looking at the options, option F is 57.96 amps for part (a). So that's looking good.

Now part (b), the torque. Torque can be calculated using the formula T = (P * 60) / (2 * π * N), where P is the power, N is the speed in rpm.

But wait, which power? Since torque is related to the power developed by the motor, but when considering output torque, it's based on the output power. Alternatively, sometimes torque is calculated based on the armature current, but I think the standard formula uses the power.

Wait, another approach: the torque in a motor can be found using T = (9.55 * power) / speed, where power is in watts and speed is in rpm. So that's another way to think about it.

Wait, but let me make sure. The formula T (in Nm) = (Power (W) * 60) / (2 * π * speed (rpm)) ) is correct. Alternatively, it's (Power * 9.55) / speed.

So the output power is 11,190 W. So let's plug that in.

T = (9.55 * 11,190) / 1800.

Wait, let's compute that.

First, 9.55 * 11,190 = let's see. 10,000 *9.55 is 95,500. 190 *9.55 is about 1,814.5. So 95,500 + 1,814.5 = 97,314.5.

Now divide by 1800: 97,314.5 / 1800 ≈ 54.07 Nm.

Wait, but the options are in lb-ft. So I need to convert Nm to lb-ft.

I remember that 1 Nm is approximately 0.737562 lb-ft. So 54.07 Nm * 0.737562 ≈ let's compute that.

54 * 0.737562 ≈ around 54 * 0.737 is 39.8, and 0.07 *0.737 is about 0.051. So approx 39.8 + 0.051 ≈ 39.85 lb-ft.

Wait, but my calculation earlier might have an error because I used the output power. Alternatively, maybe I should use the armature power instead of the output power. Hmm.

Wait, the output power is the mechanical power, which is equal to the armature power minus the losses. Or wait, the armature power is the input to the armature, which is I_armature * V. Then, the output power (mechanical) is armature power minus the armature losses, which are I_a^2 * R_armature plus other losses, but perhaps for torque calculation, it's based on the developed power, which would be the mechanical power plus some losses, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula T = (I_a * Z * φ * P ) / (2π A), but that's getting complicated without knowing the machine's details.

Alternatively, considering that the output power is 11,190 W, so using that to compute torque.

Wait, earlier calculation gave me about 54 Nm, which converts to about 39.85 lb-ft. Looking at the options, option F has 43.77 lb-ft, which doesn't match. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the torque using the developed power, which would be the input to the armature. Because the output power is the mechanical power after accounting for motor losses.

Wait, the armature's input power is I_a * V = 57.96 A * 220 V = 12,753.2 W.

But not all of that is mechanical power; some is lost as heat (I^2 R losses) and other losses.

Wait, the overall efficiency is 87%, which is output power divided by input power. So the input power is 12,862 W (as I calculated before), and the output is 11,190 W.

So the output power is 11,190 W. So when I calculated the torque with that, I got approximately 39.85 lb-ft, but the options don't seem to have that. Option F says 43.77 lb-ft.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the armature power instead. Let's try that.

Wait, the armature power is I_a * V = 57.96 * 220 = let's compute that. 57.96 * 200 is 11,592, and 57.96 * 20 is 1,159.2. So total is 12,751.2 W.

But the output power is 11,190 W, so the difference is 12,751.2 - 11,190 = 1,561.2 W, which would be the losses (like I_a^2 R_armature and other losses). But for torque calculation, perhaps I should use the armature's developed power, which is the mechanical power plus the armature's own losses.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: torque is related to the power output at the shaft. So T = (P_output * 60) / (2 * π * N) ), which is the same as (9.55 * P_output) / N.

So P_output is 11,190 W, so T = 9.55 * 11,190 / 1800.

Compute 9.55 * 11,190 first.

Let me compute 10,000 *9.55=95,500, 190*9.55=1,814.5 → total 97,314.5.

Then 97,314.5 /1800 ≈ 54.07 Nm.

Convert 54.07 Nm to lb-ft: 54.07 * 0.737562 ≈ 39.85 lb-ft.

But none of the options match that exactly. Looking at the options, option F is 43.77 lb-ft, which is higher.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong power. Perhaps the developed torque is based on the armature's input, considering that the armature's input is higher than the output.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the torque is calculated based on the line current, considering the field current as part of the total, but I don't think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the torque using the developed power, which is the armature power minus the armature copper losses. So the developed power is the mechanical power plus the armature losses.

Wait, the armature current is 57.96 A, and the armature voltage is 220 V, so the armature input is 57.96 * 220 = 12,751 W.

The output is 11,190 W, so the difference is 1,561 W, which would be the sum of armature copper losses and other losses. But without knowing the exact armature resistance, it's hard to be precise.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the torque using the armature current and some formula involving it. But without knowing the machine's constants like flux or number of conductors, I can't use those formulas.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a better approach. Since we know the motor's efficiency, perhaps the torque can be calculated from the output power, which is 11,190 W.

Wait, let's try the calculation again.

T = 9.55 * P / N

So P is 11,190 W, N is 1800 rpm.

T = 9.55 * 11,190 / 1800.

Compute 11,190 / 1800 = 6.2167.

Then 9.55 * 6.2167 ≈ let's see.

6 * 9.55 = 57.3, 0.2167 *9.55 ≈ 2.07. So total ≈ 57.3 + 2.07 = 59.37 Nm.

Wait, wait, wait, that's different from before. Wait, no, wait, 11,190 / 1800 is 6.216666...

Then 9.55 * 6.216666 = let me compute more accurately.

Compute 6 * 9.55 = 57.3.

0.216666 * 9.55 = approx 2.068.

So total is approximately 57.3 + 2.068 = 59.368 Nm.

Wait, that's very different from the previous 54 Nm. That's because I think I made a mistake earlier in the calculation.

Wait, 9.55 * 11,190 = let me compute it correctly.

11,190 * 9.55.

Let me break it down:

11,190 * 9 = 100,710.

11,190 * 0.55 = 6,154.5.

So total is 100,710 + 6,154.5 = 106,864.5.

Then divide by 1800.

106,864.5 / 1800 ≈ 59.36 Nm.

Ah, that's much better. So 59.36 Nm.

Now convert that to lb-ft: 59.36 Nm * 0.737562 lb-ft/Nm ≈ 59.36 * 0.737562.

Let me compute that:

59 * 0.737562 = approx 59 * 0.7 is 41.3, 59 * 0.037562 is approx 2.22. So 41.3 + 2.22 ≈ 43.52 lb-ft.

Hmm, that's close to 43.5 lb-ft, which matches option F's 43.77 lb-ft. Wait, but my calculation gave me 43.52, and option F is 43.77. Close enough considering rounding errors.

Wait, but wait a second, where did I get 9.55 from? Oh right, the formula T = (Power * 60) / (2πN), and 60/(2π) is approximately 9.549296..., so 9.55.

So yes, the torque is approximately 59.36 Nm, which is about 43.52 lb-ft. Option F gives 43.77, which is very close.

So putting it together, part (a) is 57.96 A, which is option F's first part, and part (b) is approximately 43.77 lb-ft, which matches option F exactly.

So the answer should be option F.

To solve the problem, we calculate the full-load armature current and the torque of the shunt motor based on the given data:

### Part (a): Full-Load Armature Current
1. **Field Current**: The field resistance is 440 Ω, and the supply voltage is 220 V. The field current is:
   \[
   I_{\text{shunt}} = \frac{V}{R_{\text{shunt}}} = \frac{220}{440} = 0.5 \, \text{A}
   \]

2. **Input Power**: The motor has an output of 15 hp, which is converted to watts:
   \[
   P_{\text{output}} = 15 \times 746 = 11,190 \, \text{W}
   \]
   The efficiency is 87%, so the input power is:
   \[
   P_{\text{input}} = \frac{P_{\text{output}}}{\eta} = \frac{11,190}{0.87} \approx 12,862.07 \, \text{W}
   \]

3. **Armature Current**: The input power is also related to the supply voltage and the total current:
   \[
   P_{\text{input}} = V \times (I_a + I_{\text{shunt}})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   12,862.07 = 220 \times (I_a + 0.5)
   \]
   Solving for \(I_a\):
   \[
   I_a + 0.5 = \frac{12,862.07}{220} \approx 58.46 \, \text{A}
   \]
   \[
   I_a \approx 58.46 - 0.5 = 57.96 \, \text{A}
   \]

Thus, the full-load armature current is approximately **57.96 A**.

---

### Part (b): Torque of the Machine
The torque can be calculated using the formula:
\[
T = \frac{9.55 \times P_{\text{output}}}{N}
\]
where \(P_{\text{output}} = 11,190 \, \text{W}\) and \(N = 1800 \, \text{rpm}\). Substituting:
\[
T = \frac{9.55 \times 11,190}{1800}
\]
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
9.55 \times 11,190 = 106,864.5
\]
Then divide by 1800:
\[
T = \frac{106,864.5}{1800} \approx 59.36 \, \text{Nm}
\]

Convert the torque from Nm to lb-ft (1 Nm ≈ 0.737562 lb-ft):
\[
T = 59.36 \times 0.737562 \approx 43.77 \, \text{lb-ft}
\]

Thus, the torque is approximately **43.77 lb-ft**.

---

### Final Answer
Comparing the calculated values with the options:
- Part (a): \(I_a = 57.96 \, \text{A}\) matches option **F**.
- Part (b): \(T = 43.77 \, \text{lb-ft}\) matches option **F**.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**F: 57.96 amps, 43.77 lb. ft**

The final answer is:

**F**
