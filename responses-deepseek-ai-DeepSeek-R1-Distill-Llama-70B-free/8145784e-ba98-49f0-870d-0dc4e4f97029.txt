Okay, so I have this question about utility functions and certainty equivalent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that an investor has a utility function U(x) = x^(1/4). His job offer is $80,000 plus a bonus. The bonus can be $0, $10k, $20k, up to $60k, each with equal probability. So that's seven possible outcomes, each with probability 1/7.

The question is asking for the certainty equivalent value of this job offer. From what I remember, the certainty equivalent is the certain amount of money that gives the same utility as the expected utility of the risky option.

So first, I think I need to calculate the expected utility of the job offer. Then, find the value of x where U(x) equals that expected utility. That x will be the certainty equivalent.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, list all possible total salaries. The base is $80k, so adding each bonus:

- 0 → 80,000
- 10,000 → 90,000
- 20,000 → 100,000
- 30,000 → 110,000
- 40,000 → 120,000
- 50,000 → 130,000
- 60,000 → 140,000

Wait, wait, no, wait. Oh wait! No, wait. The base is $80k, and the bonus is added to that. So the possible total salaries are:

80,000 + bonus. So each bonus is 0 to 60,000 in 10k increments. So the possible total salaries are 80k, 90k, 100k, 110k, 120k, 130k, 140k.

Each of these occurs with probability 1/7, since there are seven outcomes.

Now I need to compute the expected utility. The utility function is U(x) = x^(1/4). So for each possible salary, I calculate U(salary), then average them.

So let me compute each U(x):

1. U(80,000) = (80,000)^(1/4)
2. U(90,000) = (90,000)^(1/4)
3. U(100,000) = (100,000)^(1/4)
4. U(110,000) = (110,000)^(1/4)
5. U(120,000) = (120,000)^(1/4)
6. U(130,000) = (130,000)^(1/4)
7. U(140,000) = (140,000)^(1/4)

Wait, calculating fourth roots might be a bit tricky without a calculator. Maybe I can find a way to simplify this. Alternatively, express each as (x)^(0.25).

Alternatively, note that 100,000 is (10^5), so 100,000^(1/4) is (10^5)^(1/4) = 10^(5/4) ≈ 10^1.25 = about 17.7828.

Similarly, 80,000 is 8*10^4, so (8*10^4)^(1/4) = (8)^(1/4) * (10^4)^(1/4) = 8^(0.25) * 10^(1). 8^(0.25) is the same as (2^3)^(1/4) = 2^(3/4) ≈ 1.6818. So 1.6818 * 10 = ~16.818.

Wait, let's compute each one:

1. 80,000: 80,000^(0.25) = (8e4)^(0.25) = (8)^(0.25) * (1e4)^(0.25) = 1.6818 * 10 = 16.818.

2. 90,000: 90,000^(0.25) = (9e4)^(0.25) = (9)^(0.25) * (1e4)^(0.25) = sqrt(sqrt(9)) * 10 = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, so 1.732 *10 ≈17.32.

Wait, wait, 9^(0.25) is (3^2)^(0.25) = 3^(0.5) = sqrt(3), yes. So 1.732 *10=17.32.

3. 100,000: As before, about 17.7828.

4. 110,000: Let's compute 110,000^(0.25). Let me think in terms of 100,000. 110,000 is 1.1 times 100,000. So (1.1e5)^(0.25) = (1.1)^(0.25) * (1e5)^(0.25) = approx 1.1^0.25 *17.7828.

What's 1.1^0.25? Well, natural log of 1.1 is ~0.09531. Multiply by 0.25: ~0.02383. Exponentiate: e^0.02383 ≈ 1.02415. So 17.7828 *1.02415 ≈ approx 18.20.

Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to compute it as (110000)^(1/4).

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each term numerically. Let's try to find approximate values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write each term as x = 80,000 + 10,000 * n, where n ranges from 0 to 6.

So x = 80,000 +10,000n. So for n=0, x=80,000; n=6, x=140,000.

I think I can express each x as 10,000*(8 +n). So x = 10^4*(8 +n). Then, U(x) = (10^4*(8+n))^(1/4) = (10^4)^(1/4) * (8+n)^(1/4) ) = 10^(1) * (8+n)^(1/4) = 10*(8+n)^(0.25).

So the expected utility E[U] is the average of U(x) over n=0 to 6.

E[U] = (1/7) * sum_{n=0 to 6} [10*(n+8)^(0.25)] = (10/7) * sum_{n=0 to6} (n+8)^(1/4).

So I can compute sum = (8)^(0.25) + (9)^(0.25) + (10)^(0.25) + (11)^(0.25) + (12)^(0.25) + (13)^(0.25) + (14)^(0.25).

Wait, wait, no: n runs from 0 to 6, so n+8 from 8 to 14. So the terms are 8,9,10,11,12,13,14. So each term is (8)^(1/4), (9)^(1/4), up to (14)^(1/4).

So I need to compute each of these and sum them.

Let's compute each term:

1. 8^(1/4) = (2^3)^(1/4) = 2^(3/4) ≈ 1.6818.

2. 9^(1/4) = (3^2)^(1/4) = 3^(0.5) ≈ 1.73205.

3. 10^(1/4) ≈ 1.778279.

4. 11^(1/4): Hmm, let me think. 3^4 is 81, so 10 is about 3.16^2, but maybe I can approximate. Alternatively, using logarithms.

Compute ln(11) ≈2.3979. Multiply by 0.25: 0.599475. Exp(0.599475) is about e^0.6≈1.8221. So 11^(1/4)≈1.8221.

5. 12^(1/4): ln(12)=2.4849. 0.25*2.4849=0.6212. e^0.6212≈1.860.

6. 13^(1/4): ln(13)=2.5649. 0.25*2.5649=0.6412. e^0.6412≈1.897.

7. 14^(1/4): ln(14)=2.6391. 0.25*2.6391=0.6598. e^0.6598≈1.933.

So adding these up:

1.6818 + 1.73205 = ~3.4138

+1.7783 = 5.1921

+1.8221 = 7.0142

+1.86 = 8.8742

+1.897 = 10.7712

+1.933 = 12.7042.

Wait wait, let me recheck the additions step by step.

Term 1: 1.6818 → sum =1.6818

Term 2: +1.73205 → sum=3.41385

Term3: +1.778279 → sum=5.192129

Term4: +1.8221 → sum=7.014229

Term5: +1.86 → sum=8.874229

Term6: +1.897 → sum=10.771229

Term7: +1.933 → sum=12.704229.

So sum ≈12.7042.

E[U] = (10/7) * sum ≈ (10/7)*12.7042 ≈ (10 * 12.7042)/7.

Compute 12.7042 *10=127.042.

127.042 /7 ≈18.1631.

So E[U] ≈18.1631.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Because earlier I expressed U(x) as 10*(n+8)^(1/4), so sum of U(x) is 10 times sum of (n+8)^(1/4). So E[U] is (10/7)*sum ≈ (10/7)*12.7042≈18.163.

So E[U] ≈18.163.

Now, the certainty equivalent (CE) is the x such that U(x) = E[U]. So U(CE) = 18.163.

But U(x) = x^(1/4), so:

x^(1/4) = 18.163.

To find x, raise both sides to the 4th power.

x = (18.163)^4.

Wait, let's compute that. Hmm, 18^4 is (18)^2 squared. 18^2=324. 324^2=104,976.

But 18.163 is a bit more than 18. Let me compute (18.163)^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it step by step.

First, compute 18.163 squared:

18.163^2 ≈ Let's see, 18^2=324. 0.163^2≈0.0266. Cross term 2*18*0.163 = 5.868.

So (18 + 0.163)^2 ≈ 324 +5.868 +0.0266 ≈ 329.8946.

Now, square that again to get (18.163)^4.

So (329.8946)^2.

Let me compute that:

329.8946 * 329.8946.

Approximate:

First, 330^2=108900. But let's compute it more accurately.

(330 - 0.1054)^2 = 330^2 - 2*330*0.1054 + (0.1054)^2.

= 108900 - (2*330*0.1054) + 0.01114.

Compute 2*330=660. 660 *0.1054≈660 *0.1=66; 660*0.0054≈3.564 → total ≈69.564.

So 108900 -69.564 +0.01114 ≈108900 -69.564=108830.436 +0.01114≈108830.447.

So (18.163)^4 ≈108,830.447.

Wait, but this can't be right because looking at the options, the highest is 130,000. So CE is about 108,830, which isn't an option. Wait, the options are A-J, and I see option B is 108610, which is close. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps my approximations are off. Let's think again.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum calculation. Because when I computed the sum of (n+8)^(1/4) from n=0-6, I got about 12.7042. Let me double-check those approximate values.

Let me try to compute each (n+8)^(1/4) more accurately.

n ranges from 0 to 6, so n+8 is 8,9,10,11,12,13,14.

Compute each:

8^(0.25) = 8^(1/4) = (2^3)^(1/4) = 2^(3/4) ≈ 1.6817928.

9^(0.25) = 3^(1/2) ≈1.7320508.

10^(0.25): Let me compute it more accurately. 10^0.25.

We can compute it as e^( (ln10)/4 ). ln10≈2.302585. So 2.302585 /4=0.575646.

e^0.575646 ≈ 1.7777778 (wait, actually e^0.5756 is approximately 1.7778).

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

e^0.5=1.64872, e^0.6=1.8221188.

At 0.575646, it's about 1.7778. So 10^(1/4)= approx 1.778.

11^(0.25): Let's compute more accurately.

ln(11)=2.397895.

Divide by 4: 0.5994738.

e^0.5994738. Let me compute e^0.59947.

We can compute it as e^0.5 * e^0.09947.

e^0.5=1.64872.

e^0.09947 ≈1 +0.09947 + (0.09947^2)/2 + (0.09947^3)/6 + ... Let's compute up to third order.

0.09947 ≈0.1. So (0.1)^2=0.01, divided by 2=0.005. (0.1)^3=0.001, /6≈0.0001667.

So e^0.09947 ≈1 +0.09947 +0.005 +0.0001667≈1.10463.

So e^0.59947≈1.64872 *1.10463≈ let's compute:

1.64872 *1.1 =1.81359.

1.64872 *0.00463≈approx 0.00763.

So total ≈1.8212.

So 11^(1/4)= approx 1.8212.

12^(0.25): ln(12)=2.48490665.

Divide by 4: 0.62122666.

e^0.62122666.

Again, split into e^0.6 * e^0.02122666.

e^0.6=1.8221188.

e^0.02122666≈1 +0.02122666 + (0.02122666)^2/2 + (0.02122666)^3/6.

0.02122666^2 ≈0.0004505, /2≈0.000225.

0.02122666^3≈0.00000956, /6≈0.0000016.

So e^0.02122666≈1.02126.

So e^0.6212266≈1.8221188 *1.02126 ≈1.8603.

So 12^(1/4)= approx 1.8603.

13^(0.25): ln(13)=2.564949.

Divide by 4: 0.6412373.

e^0.6412373.

Compute e^0.6=1.8221188.

e^0.6412373-0.6=0.0412373.

e^0.0412373≈1 +0.0412373 + (0.0412373^2)/2 + (0.0412373^3)/6.

0.0412373^2=0.00170, /2=0.00085.

0.0412373^3≈0.0000698, /6≈0.0000116.

So e^0.0412373≈1.0412373 +0.00085 +0.0000116≈1.0421.

So e^0.6412373≈1.8221188 *1.0421≈ let's compute:

1.8221 *1.04 =1.8221 *1=1.8221, 1.8221 *0.04=0.07288. So total ≈1.89498.

So 13^(1/4)≈1.895.

14^(0.25): ln(14)=2.639057.

Divide by 4: 0.659764.

e^0.659764.

Again, split into e^0.6 * e^0.059764.

e^0.6≈1.8221188.

e^0.059764≈1 +0.059764 + (0.059764^2)/2 + (0.059764^3)/6.

0.059764^2≈0.003573, /2≈0.001786.

0.059764^3≈0.0002123, /6≈0.0000354.

So e^0.059764≈1.059764 +0.001786 +0.0000354≈1.061585
