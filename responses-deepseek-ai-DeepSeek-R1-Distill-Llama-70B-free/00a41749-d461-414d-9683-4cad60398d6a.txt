Alright, so I have this genetics problem here about MN blood types in a population. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty on blood type genetics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me a table with the counts of M, N, and MN phenotypes in a village. The numbers are M:53, N:4, MN:29, and the total is 86. They're asking for the frequencies of the L^M and L^N alleles. 

Wait, I remember that the MN blood group is determined by two alleles, L^M and L^N, which are codominant. So each person has two alleles, and their phenotype depends on which alleles they have. The possible genotypes are L^M L^M (M), L^M L^N (MN), and L^N L^N (N). Right, so each phenotype corresponds directly to their genotype.

So the frequencies of the alleles can be found using the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The formula to find allele frequencies is p^2 + 2pq + q^2 =1, where p is the frequency of L^M and q is L^N. But to find p and q, I need to look at the genotype frequencies.

Wait, let me think. The phenotype M corresponds to L^M L^M, so that's p^2. The phenotype N is L^N L^N, which is q^2. And the MN phenotype is L^M L^N, which is 2pq.

So I can calculate the frequencies of each genotype by dividing the counts by the total population.

M (L^M L^M): 53/86
N (L^N L^N):4/86
MN (L^M L^N):29/86

Wait, but wait—no, that's the phenotype frequencies, which are the same as the genotype frequencies because each phenotype maps directly to a genotype in this case.

So to find p (L^M), I can take the square root of the M frequency, right? Because p^2 is the frequency of M. Alternatively, another approach is to calculate p as (number of L^M alleles) divided by the total alleles in the population.

Oh, right! For a diploid population, each individual has two alleles. So the total number of alleles is 2*N, where N is the population size.

So the total number of alleles is 2*86=172.

Now, the number of L^M alleles comes from the M and MN phenotypes. Each M individual has two L^M alleles, and each MN has one.

So number of L^M alleles = (number of M * 2) + (number of MN * 1) 

That's (53 *2) + (29 *1) = 106 +29=135.

Similarly, the number of L^N alleles is (number of N *2) + (number of MN *1) = (4*2)+(29)=8+29=37.

Wait, let me check: 53 M people contribute 53*2=106 L^M alleles. 29 MN contribute 29 L^M. So 106+29=135 L^M alleles. Total alleles 172. So frequency p (L^M) is 135/172.

Similarly, L^N is 37/172. Wait, but 135 +37=172, which adds up, since 53*2 (M) is 106, 4*2 (N)=8, and 29*2 (MN)=58, but wait, no: wait, for MN each person has one L^M and one L^N. So the total L^M is 53*2 +29*1=106+29=135. L^N is 4*2 +29*1=8+29=37. So yes, 135+37=172.

So p =135/172. Let me calculate that. 135 divided by 172. Let's see, 172 is 86*2, so 86 is 43*2. 135/172 approx equals 0.784? Let me compute it. 172*0.78 is 134.16. 172*0.784= let me compute 0.78*172=134.16, 0.004*172=0.688, so 134.16+0.688=134.848. 135-134.848=0.152 left. So approximately 0.7843. So p≈0.784.

Similarly, q is 37/172. 37/172 is approximately 0.215. Because 37*5=185, so 37/172 is about 0.215.

Wait, but let me check the numbers again. 53 M, so 53*2=106 L^M. 29 MN, so 29 L^M. So 106+29=135. L^M. 4 N, so 4*2=8 L^N. 29 MN, 29 L^N. 8+29=37.

So p=135/(2*86) =135/172. Let me compute that. 172 ÷ 2 is 86. 135 ÷ 86 is approximately 1.569... Wait, no, that's 135/86. But that's not correct. Wait, no, I'm thinking of 135/172.

Let me compute 135 ÷ 172.

172 goes into 135 zero times. So 0. Let's add a decimal. 172 into 1350. 172 *7=1204, 172*8=1376. So 7 times. 7*172=1204. Subtract from 1350: 1350-1204=146. Bring down a zero: 1460.

172*8=1376. 1460-1376=84. Bring down zero: 840.

172*4=688. 840-688=152. Bring down zero: 1520.

172*8=1376. 1520-1376=144. Bring down zero:1440.

172*8=1376. 1440-1376=64. So it's approximately 0.784...

So p≈0.784, and q=37/172≈0.215.

Wait, but let me compute 37/172. Let's see, 172 × 0.2 is 34.4. 37-34.4=2.6. So 2.6/172=≈0.0151. So 0.2+0.0151≈0.215. So yes, 0.215.

So the frequencies are L^M ≈0.784 and L^N≈0.215.

Looking at the options:

Option I says L^M=0.785 and L^N=0.215. That's the closest. So the correct answer should be option I.

To determine the frequencies of the **L^M** and **L^N** alleles in the population, we use the data provided:

- **M phenotype (L^M L^M):** 53 individuals  
- **N phenotype (L^N L^N):** 4 individuals  
- **MN phenotype (L^M L^N):** 29 individuals  
- **Total population:** 86 individuals  

The MN blood group system is codominant, meaning the phenotype directly reflects the genotype. The allele frequencies can be calculated using the counts of each phenotype:

1. **Total alleles in the population:**  
   Since each individual is diploid, the total number of alleles is:  
   \[
   2 \times \text{Total population} = 2 \times 86 = 172
   \]

2. **Number of L^M alleles:**  
   - Each M individual contributes 2 L^M alleles: \( 53 \times 2 = 106 \)  
   - Each MN individual contributes 1 L^M allele: \( 29 \times 1 = 29 \)  
   - Total L^M alleles: \( 106 + 29 = 135 \)

3. **Number of L^N alleles:**  
   - Each N individual contributes 2 L^N alleles: \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \)  
   - Each MN individual contributes 1 L^N allele: \( 29 \times 1 = 29 \)  
   - Total L^N alleles: \( 8 + 29 = 37 \)

4. **Frequencies of the alleles:**  
   - Frequency of **L^M**:  
     \[
     p = \frac{\text{Number of L^M alleles}}{\text{Total alleles}} = \frac{135}{172} \approx 0.784
     \]
   - Frequency of **L^N**:  
     \[
     q = \frac{\text{Number of L^N alleles}}{\text{Total alleles}} = \frac{37}{172} \approx 0.215
     \]

5. **Comparison with the options:**  
   The closest match to these frequencies is **Option I**, which states:  
   - Frequency of **L^M** = 0.785  
   - Frequency of **L^N** = 0.215  

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I: frequency L^M = .785, frequency L^N = .215**
