Okay, so I have this accounting question here about inventory valuation methods. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about Mast Co. switching from FIFO to LIFO during a period of inflation. I need to figure out how this change affects their ending inventory and income tax payable.

First, I remember that FIFO and LIFO are methods to value inventory. FIFO stands for First-In, First-Out, which assumes that the oldest items are sold first. LIFO is Last-In, First-Out, so the most recent items are sold first.

In a period of inflation, the prices are rising. So the cost of goods purchased later would be higher than those purchased earlier.

Under FIFO, the oldest (and thus cheaper) items are considered sold first. So the ending inventory would consist of the more recent, higher-priced items. Because each new purchase is more expensive, the ending inventory value under FIFO would be higher.

Now, switching to LIFO. Under LIFO, the most recent (and more expensive) items are considered sold first. So the cost of goods sold (COGS) would be higher because you're selling the more expensive items. Wait, no, actually, wait—no, wait. When you use LIFO, the cost of the most recent items goes into COGS. So during inflation, COGS increases.

But wait, let me clarify. When prices are rising, the cost of the latest goods is higher. So in LIFO, since you're selling the latest (higher cost) goods, COGS is higher, which would mean that net income is lower. Because COGS is higher, profits go down.

But wait, the question is about ending inventory. So under LIFO, the ending inventory is made up of the oldest items, which were purchased when prices were lower. Because in LIFO, the latest items are sold, so the remaining inventory is the older, cheaper stuff. So the ending inventory under LIFO would be lower than FIFO.

So comparing FIFO and LIFO during inflation: FIFO's ending inventory is higher because it's valued at recent higher prices. LIFO's ending inventory is lower because it's valued at older lower prices.

Now, the tax implications. Since Mast Co. is using LIFO for both financial statements and taxes, their taxable income would be lower because COGS is higher (as it's using more expensive, recent items). Lower taxable income means lower income tax payable. So using LIFO in an inflationary period reduces income tax payable compared to FIFO.

Wait wait, but wait. Let me double-check. 

Under FIFO, COGS is lower because you're selling the older, cheaper items. So net income is higher. Under LIFO, COGS is higher because you're selling the newer, more expensive items. So net income is lower. Therefore, taxes are based on net income. So with LIFO, taxable income is lower, so tax payable is lower.

So putting it all together: when Mast switches to LIFO during inflation, ending inventory is lower than under FIFO. And income tax payable is lower as well.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the question is comparing after the switch. So before, they were using FIFO. Now, after switching to LIFO, what's the effect.

So after switching, ending inventory is lower, and tax payable is lower.

So the options given: the first part is ending inventory, the second is income tax.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Lower Higher → No, because both are lower.

Option D: Lower Lower → Yes, that's the case.

Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Same Higher

B: Same Lower

C: Lower Higher

D: Lower Lower

E: Same Same

F: Higher Higher

G: Lower Same

H: Higher Same

I: Higher Lower

J: No change in either.

So the correct answer should be D: Lower Lower.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't mix up ending inventory. Wait, when using LIFO, ending inventory is lower because the remaining inventory is older, cheaper items. So yes, compared to FIFO, which has higher ending inventory, LIFO's is lower.

And tax payable is lower because income is lower. So both ending inventory and tax payable are lower. So option D.

When Mast Co. switches from the FIFO method to the LIFO method during a period of inflation, the effects on ending inventory and income tax payable can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Ending Inventory**:  
   Under FIFO, the oldest (and cheapest) items are considered sold first, so the ending inventory consists of the most recent, higher-priced items. In contrast, under LIFO, the most recent (and more expensive) items are considered sold first, leaving the ending inventory to consist of older, lower-priced items. Therefore, during inflation, ending inventory under LIFO is lower than under FIFO.

2. **Income Tax Payable**:  
   Using LIFO during inflation increases the cost of goods sold (COGS) because the most recent, higher-priced items are expensed first. This results in lower net income and, consequently, lower taxable income. As a result, income tax payable is also lower under LIFO compared to FIFO.

Thus, after switching to LIFO during inflation, Mast Co.'s ending inventory and income tax payable will both be lower than under FIFO.
