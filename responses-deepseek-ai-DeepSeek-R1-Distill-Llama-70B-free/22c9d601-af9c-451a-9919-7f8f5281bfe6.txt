Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Samuels buying some stocks and calculating the commission. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on.

Alright, he bought 50 shares. The round lot price is 146 1/8. Wait, round lot usually means 100 shares, right? So the price per share when buying 100 shares is 146 and 1/8 dollars. But he bought 50 shares, which is an odd lot because it's less than 100. Oh, and there's an odd-lot differential of 1/4 of a point. I think that means he has to pay a bit more per share because he's buying an odd lot. 

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure about the differential. A point is a dollar, right? So 1/4 point would be $0.25. So for each share, he has to pay an extra quarter? Or is it 1/4 of a point on the total sale? Hmm. Maybe it's added to the total price. I'll need to clarify that.

First step, I think I should calculate the total cost of the shares. The round lot price is 146 1/8 per 100 shares, but he bought 50. So I'll find the price per share first. 

146 1/8 is the same as 146.125 dollars. So per share, that's 146.125 divided by 100, which is 1.46125 dollars per share. Oh wait no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Round lot is 100 shares for 146 1/8. So each share is 146.125 / 100. No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. 146 1/8 is the price per 100 shares, so to get per share, it's 146.125 / 100, which is 1.46125 per share. No, wait, that seems low. Hmm, no, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait a second. 146 1/8 is the price for 100 shares, right? So the price per share is 146.125 dollars. So each share is $146.125. Oh, I see, I was confused before. So 100 shares cost $146.125, so each share is $1.46125? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, no, noâ€”wait, 146 1/8 is the price for each 100 shares. So 100 shares cost $146.125. So per share, it's $146.125 / 100 = $1.46125 per share. Wait, but that seems way too low for a stock price. Maybe I got this wrong. Oh wait, maybe the round lot is 100 shares, and the price is 146 1/8 per share. Oh wait, that makes more sense. So 100 shares at 146.125 each would be way too expensive. So perhaps the 146 1/8 is the price per share when buying a round lot (100 shares). So each share is $146.125, and 100 shares would cost 146.125 * 100 = $14,612.5. But Mr. Samuels bought 50 shares, so the cost would be 50 * 146.125 = $7,306.25. But wait, he's buying an odd lot, so he has to pay an extra 1/4 point per share. So the differential is 0.25 per share. So 50 shares * 0.25 = $12.50 added to the total. So the total cost becomes $7,306.25 + $12.50 = $7,318.75. 

Wait, but I'm not sure if the differential is per share or on the total. The question says it's 1/4 of a point. A point is a dollar, so 1/4 point is $0.25. So if it's per share, then yes, 50 * 0.25 is $12.50. Alternatively, if it's 1/4 point on the total sale, that would be $7,306.25 * (1/4)/100 = $18.265625. But that doesn't align with the options given. Hmm. Let me check the options. The options are: A is 85.87, B 92.50, C 75.25, D 7318.75, etc. Wait, option D is $7,318.75, which is exactly the total I calculated. But that's the total cost, not the commission. So I think the differential is added to the total, making the sale amount higher, but the commission is calculated on the sale amount. 

Wait, but the commission is based on the amount of the purchase. Let me read the brokerage rates again. They have different tiers: 

- $100 - $799: 2% plus $4.40 up to $65
- $800 - $2,499: 1.3% plus $10 up to $65
- $2,500 and above: 0.9% plus $20 up to $65

Wait, but it's about the amount of the purchase. So the sale amount (the total Mr. Samuels paid) is $7,318.75, which falls into the highest tier, $2,500 and above. So the commission would be 0.9% of the sale amount plus a $20 fee, but the plus is up to $65. So, does that mean the commission is 0.9% + $20, but the total can't exceed $65? Or is the $20 itself capped at $65? Wait, the wording is "plus $20 up to $65". Hmm, perhaps it's a bit ambiguous, but I think it's structured as the commission is a percentage plus a flat fee, and the flat fee itself has a maximum. For example, the first tier is 2% plus $4.40, up to a maximum of $65. So maybe each tier's commission is (percentage * amount) + flat fee, but the total can't exceed $65. Or perhaps the flat fee is capped at $65. That part is a bit unclear, but perhaps I should read it as the commission being (percentage of the amount) plus a flat fee, with the flat fee not exceeding $65. 

Wait, but in the first tier, it's 2% plus $4.40 up to $65. So for amounts between $100 and $799, the commission is (2% of the amount) + $4.40, but this sum can't exceed $65. Similarly, for the second tier, it's 1.3% plus $10, up to $65. The third tier is 0.9% plus $20, up to $65. So the maximum commission in any case is $65. 

So in this problem, the sale amount is $7,318.75, which is way above $2,500. So the commission is 0.9% of $7,318.75 plus $20, but the total cannot exceed $65. Let's calculate 0.9% of 7,318.75: 0.009 * 7318.75 = let's compute that. 7,318.75 * 0.009. 7,000 *0.009 is 63. 318.75 *0.009 is about 2.86875. So total is 63 + 2.86875 = 65.86875. Then add the $20 flat fee: 65.86875 +20 = 85.86875. But wait, the maximum commission is $65. So does that mean that even though the calculation gives 85.86, the maximum is 65? So the commission would be $65. 

Looking back at the options, option F is $65. So that's probably the answer. 

But wait, I thought the sale amount was $7,318.75, which is correct. So the commission is 0.9% of that plus $20, but the maximum is $65. So 0.9% is 65.86875, which is over 65, so commission is $65. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'up to $65' applies to each component. Let me re-read the table. The first line says: "$100 - $799 2.0% plus $4.40 up to $65". So perhaps the $4.40 is the maximum that part can be. Or maybe the total commission is capped at $65. Hmm. For example, in the first tier, if the amount is, say, $100, 2% is $2, plus $4.40 is $6.40, which is below $65. But if the amount is higher, like $799, 2% is ~16, plus 4.40 is 20.40, still under 65. So the cap is per tier. So for the highest tier, 0.9% plus $20, with the total not exceeding $65. So if 0.9% of 7318.75 is 65.86875, which is more than 65, so the commission is $65. 

So the commission would be $65, which is option F. 

Wait, but let me check again. Another way: maybe the 'up to $65' applies to the flat fee. So for the third tier, it's 0.9% plus $20, but the $20 can't exceed $65. That doesn't make much sense because $20 is less than $65. So perhaps the 'up to $65' is the maximum total commission for that tier. So if the calculated commission (percentage + flat fee) exceeds $65, then it's capped at $65. 

In this case, 0.9% of $7,318.75 is $65.86875, plus $20 is $85.86875. But since the tier's maximum is $65, the commission is $65. 

So the answer should be F: $65. 

Looking at the options, F is $65, which matches.

To calculate the commission on Mr. Samuels' purchase, we start by determining the total cost of the 50 shares. The round lot price is $146 1/8 per 100 shares, which is equivalent to $146.125 per share. Therefore, the cost for 50 shares is:

\[
50 \times 146.125 = 7,306.25
\]

Since Mr. Samuels purchased an odd lot (fewer than 100 shares), an odd-lot differential of 1/4 point (or $0.25 per share) is applied. Adding this differential:

\[
50 \times 0.25 = 12.50
\]

Thus, the total amount of the purchase is:

\[
7,306.25 + 12.50 = 7,318.75
\]

Next, we refer to the brokerage rates table to determine the commission. The total purchase amount of $7,318.75 falls into the highest tier: "$2,500 and above," which specifies a commission of 0.9% of the amount plus $20, with a maximum commission of $65. Calculating the commission:

\[
0.9\% \times 7,318.75 = 65.86875
\]

Adding the flat fee:

\[
65.86875 + 20 = 85.86875
\]

However, the commission cannot exceed the maximum of $65. Therefore, the final commission is:

\[
65
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**F: $65**
