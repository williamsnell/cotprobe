Okay, so I've got this question about asymptotic notation, and I'm trying to figure out which option is the largest. Hmm, I remember that asymptotic notations describe the growth rate of functions as n approaches infinity. The question gives me options from A to I, each with different O notations. I need to determine which one grows the fastest as n becomes very large.

Let me list out the options again to make sure I have them right:

A: O(n²)
B: O(n³)
C: O(sqrt(n)) which is the square root of n.
D: O(2^n)
E: O(log n) which is logarithmic.
F: O(n log n)
G: O(log log n)
H: O(1) which is constant time.
I: O(n)

I think the key is to compare the growth rates of each function as n gets large. The fastest growing function will be the largest asymptotically.

Starting with the smallest, O(1) is a constant, so it doesn't grow at all. Next, logarithmic functions like O(log n) and O(log log n) grow very slowly. Between E and G, I remember that log log n grows even slower than log n because it's the logarithm of a logarithm. So G is smaller than E.

Then comes sqrt(n), which is O(n^(1/2)). That grows faster than log n but much slower than linear functions. So C is bigger than E and G but not as big as the options that come next.

Looking at the linear options, O(n) is straightforward. Then there's O(n log n), which is F. Since log n grows slower than any polynomial, n log n is O(n^2) when n is large? Wait, no. Wait, n log n is actually bigger than O(n) because you're multiplying by log n. So F is bigger than I.

Wait, let me think again. For example, for n=1,000,000, log n is about 20, so n log n is 20,000,000. O(n²) is 1e12. So n² is bigger than n log n. So which is larger between A and F? A is O(n²), which grows faster than F as n increases.

But then there's B, which is O(n³). That's n cubed, which grows faster than n squared. So B is bigger than A.

But wait, option D is O(2^n), which is exponential. Exponential functions grow much faster than any polynomial function. So 2^n grows faster than n³ as n becomes large. So D must be larger than B.

So putting it all together, the order from smallest to largest asymptotic growth would be something like:

G (log log n) < E (log n) < H (1) < C (sqrt(n)) < I (n) < F (n log n) < A (n²) < B (n³) < D (2^n).

Wait, but I thought H is O(1), which is a constant. So it's smaller than all the others except maybe G and E. So the largest is D, O(2^n).

So the question asks which is the largest asymptotically, so the answer should be D.

The question asks which asymptotic notation grows the largest as \( n \) approaches infinity. To determine this, we analyze the growth rates of each option:

- **Option A: \( O(n^2) \)**  
  This grows quadratically, faster than linear functions but slower than exponential or higher polynomial functions.

- **Option B: \( O(n^3) \)**  
  This grows cubically, which is faster than \( O(n^2) \) but still slower than exponential growth.

- **Option C: \( O(\sqrt{n}) \)**  
  Square root growth is much slower than linear or polynomial growth.

- **Option D: \( O(2^n) \)**  
  Exponential growth, which is significantly faster than any polynomial growth as \( n \) becomes large.

- **Option E: \( O(\log n) \)**  
  Logarithmic growth is very slow, much slower than polynomial or exponential functions.

- **Option F: \( O(n \log n) \)**  
  This grows faster than linear \( O(n) \) but slower than quadratic \( O(n^2) \).

- **Option G: \( O(\log \log n) \)**  
  This grows even slower than \( O(\log n) \).

- **Option H: \( O(1) \)**  
  Constant time, which does not grow at all.

- **Option I: \( O(n) \)**  
  Linear growth, faster than logarithmic but slower than polynomial or exponential growth.

Among these, \( O(2^n) \) (Option D) grows the fastest asymptotically because exponential functions outpace all other listed growth rates as \( n \) becomes very large.
