Okay, so I have this question about determinants of matrices. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question says that A and B are both orthogonal square matrices, and the determinant of A is the negative of the determinant of B. I need to find the determinant of (A + B). 

Wait, what do I remember about orthogonal matrices? Oh right, an orthogonal matrix is one where its transpose is equal to its inverse. So that means A^T * A = I, and similarly for B. And the determinant of an orthogonal matrix has to be either 1 or -1 because when you multiply them, the determinant squared is 1. So det(A) is either 1 or -1, same with det(B).

But the question says det A = -det B. So if det A is 1, then det B must be -1, and vice versa. That makes sense.

Now, what about the determinant of A+B? Hmm. Wait, I'm trying to think if there's a property that relates det(A+B) directly to det(A) and det(B). I don't recall a straightforward formula for that. Oh wait, the determinant of a sum isn't the sum of determinants. So det(A + B) isn't det A + det B. That's not helpful.

So I need another approach. Maybe think of specific examples of orthogonal matrices where this condition holds. Let's consider the simplest case, maybe 2x2 matrices.

Let me think about rotation matrices. A rotation matrix is orthogonal. For example, a rotation by θ degrees has determinant cosθ * cosθ - sinθ * sinθ = cos(2θ). Wait, no, the determinant is actually 1, because rotation matrices have determinant 1. But if I use a reflection matrix, the determinant would be -1. Oh right, reflection matrices are orthogonal too.

Wait, maybe a simple example would help. Let's take A as a rotation matrix with det A = 1, and B as a reflection matrix with det B = -1. Then det A = -det B, which matches the condition.

Wait, but what's A + B in that case? Let me pick specific matrices. Let me think of A as the identity matrix. The identity matrix is orthogonal because its transpose is itself, and inverse is itself. So det(A) = 1. Then B should be a matrix with det(B) = -1. For example, a reflection across a line. Let's say B is a diagonal matrix with entries [1, -1], so det B is -1.

So A is [[1,0],[0,1]], B is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Then A + B would be [[2, 0], [0, 0]]. What's the determinant of that matrix? The determinant of a diagonal matrix is the product of the diagonal elements. So 2 * 0 = 0.

Hmm, so in this case, det(A + B) is zero. So the answer would be 0.0, which is option B.

Wait, but is this the only case? Let me think of another example. Suppose A is a rotation matrix with θ=0, which is the identity matrix. Then B could be another matrix with determinant -1, like [[-1,0],[0,1]], but wait, that matrix has determinant -1 * 1 = -1. So A + B would be [[0,0],[0,2]]. The determinant is 0*2 - 0*0 = 0. So again, determinant is zero.

Another test case. Let me take A as a 90-degree rotation matrix. So A would be [[0, -1], [1, 0]], which has determinant (0*0) - (-1*1) = 1. Then B needs to have determinant -1. Let's take B as the reflection matrix [[1,0],[0,-1]], determinant is -1. So A + B is [[1, -1], [1, -1]]. Let's compute the determinant: (1)(-1) - (-1)(1) = -1 +1 = 0. So again, determinant is zero.

Hmm, so all these examples are giving me zero. So maybe the determinant of (A+B) is always zero under these conditions. So the answer is 0.0, which is option B.

If A and B are orthogonal square matrices, their determinants must satisfy \( \det(A) = \pm 1 \) and \( \det(B) = \pm 1 \). The problem states \( \det(A) = -\det(B) \), which implies that one determinant is \( 1 \) and the other is \( -1 \).

To find \( \det(A + B) \), we consider specific examples of orthogonal matrices. For instance, let \( A \) be the identity matrix, which has \( \det(A) = 1 \), and \( B \) be a reflection matrix with \( \det(B) = -1 \). Adding these matrices, \( A + B \), results in a matrix whose determinant is computed to be \( 0 \). Testing other pairs of orthogonal matrices, such as rotation and reflection matrices, consistently yields \( \det(A + B) = 0 \).

Thus, the determinant of \( A + B \) is always \( 0 \) under the given conditions.
