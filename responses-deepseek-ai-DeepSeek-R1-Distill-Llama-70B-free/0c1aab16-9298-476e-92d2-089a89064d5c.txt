Question:

Stomata allow gases, such as H2O and CO2, to exchange between the inside of a plant leaf and the surrounding environment. Which of the following occurs under normal daytime environmental conditions?

Options:

A: CO2 diffuses out of the leaf faster than H2O enters.
B: H2O and CO2 both diffuse out of the leaf at the same rate.
C: H2O exchanges with CO2 at equal rates.
D: CO2 diffuses out of the leaf slower than H2O enters.
E: H2O and CO2 do not exchange at all.
F: CO2 diffuses into the leaf faster than H2O exits.
G: There is no gas exchange under normal daytime conditions.
H: H2O diffuses out of the leaf slower than CO2 enters.
I: H2O diffuses out of the leaf faster than CO2 enters.
J: H2O diffuses into the leaf faster than CO2 exits.

Okay, so I've got this question about stomata and gas exchange in plants. Hmm, I remember that stomata are these tiny pores on the surface of leaves, right? They're crucial for the plant's respiration and photosynthesis. Oh wait, during the day, plants are usually undergoing photosynthesis, which means they're taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. But wait, wait, wait—stomata are involved in exchanging gases, including CO2 and water vapor.

So the question is about what happens under normal daytime conditions. Let's think: during the day, especially when it's light, plants open their stomata to let CO2 in for photosynthesis. But when the stomata are open, they also let water vapor escape. That's transpiration, which is part of the water cycle.

Now, the question is about the exchange rates of H2O and CO2. Which one moves faster? I remember that water vapor tends to diffuse out of the leaf faster than CO2 diffuses in. Why? Oh right, because the concentration gradient for water is usually steeper. The air outside the leaf is typically drier than the interior, so water evaporates from the leaf cells into the air more rapidly. On the flip side, CO2 is being taken into the leaf for photosynthesis, but the concentration gradient for CO2 isn't as steep as that for water vapor because CO2 is used up in the leaf cells during the Calvin cycle. So even though both are moving through the stomata, water exits faster than CO2 enters.

Looking at the options, option I says "H2O diffuses out of the leaf faster than CO2 enters." That sounds right. Option F says CO2 diffuses in faster, which doesn't fit. Option D is the opposite. And other options don't seem to match what I'm thinking.

Wait, let me make sure. During the day, plants are taking in CO2 and releasing O2, but the main exchange through stomata involves CO2 in and H2O out. Since H2O is a byproduct of respiration, but wait no, during photosynthesis, plants release O2 but take in CO2. Oh wait, wait—no, during photosynthesis, plants use CO2 and release O2. So in the daytime, CO2 is being absorbed into the leaf through the stomata, while H2O is being released. But which is faster?

CO2 is entering, and H2O is exiting. So the rate of H2O exiting would be higher than CO2 entering because water vapor has a higher diffusion rate. I think that's correct because water evaporates more readily. So H2O diffuses out faster than CO2 comes in. So the correct answer should be I.

Stomata are small pores on the leaves of plants that facilitate gas exchange, including the entry of CO2 for photosynthesis and the exit of H2O through transpiration. During normal daytime conditions, plants open their stomata to allow CO2 to enter for photosynthesis, while simultaneously releasing water vapor into the air. The rate of water vapor diffusion out of the leaf is typically faster than the rate of CO2 diffusion into the leaf. This is because the concentration gradient for water vapor is steeper, as the air outside the leaf is usually drier than the interior of the leaf. Additionally, water evaporates more readily than CO2 diffuses into the leaf. Therefore, under normal daytime conditions, H2O diffuses out of the leaf faster than CO2 enters.

The correct answer is **I: H2O diffuses out of the leaf faster than CO2 enters.**
