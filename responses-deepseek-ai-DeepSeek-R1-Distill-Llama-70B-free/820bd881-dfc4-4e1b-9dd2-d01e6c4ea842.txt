Okay, so I've got this question here about correlations between GPA and study time. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but let's think this through.

The question says that when the correlation between high school students' GPA and their study time is a certain value, about 15% of the variability in GPA is explained by study time. So I need to figure out what that correlation value is.

I remember that correlation coefficients measure the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. The value ranges from -1 to +1. But wait, how does that relate to the percentage of variability explained?

Oh right, the coefficient of determination is the square of the correlation coefficient. The coefficient of determination, r², tells us the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that's predictable from the independent variable. So if the correlation is r, then r² is the percentage.

The question states that about 15% of the variability is accounted for. So that means r² is 0.15. Because 15% is 0.15 in decimal form.

Wait, so if r² is 0.15, then the correlation r would be the square root of 0.15. Let me calculate that. The square root of 0.15 is approximately 0.387, which is about 0.39 when rounded. But wait, the question is about the correlation value, which is r, not r squared.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.39, and option C is 0.39 squared. Oh wait, option C says 0.39^2, which would be about 0.1521, which is close to 0.15. That's a bit confusing. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the correlation is ____ , and that 15% variability is accounted for. So the 15% comes from r squared. So r is the square root of 0.15, which is about 0.39. So the correlation value is 0.39, which is option E.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to think: if the correlation is 0.39, then r squared is 0.1521, which is about 15%. So the answer would be E (0.39). But I see another option F is 0.15 squared. Oh, no, F is 0.15 squared, which is 0.0225, so that's 2.25%, which is way lower than 15%. So that's not right.

So the correct answer is E, 0.39. Because r is 0.39, and r squared is 0.15, which is 15% variability explained.

The question asks for the correlation value when 15% of the variability in GPA is explained by study time. The coefficient of determination, \( r^2 \), represents the proportion of variance explained, so \( r^2 = 0.15 \). Taking the square root of \( 0.15 \) gives \( r \approx 0.39 \). Among the options, \( 0.39 \) corresponds to option E. 

Answer: E
