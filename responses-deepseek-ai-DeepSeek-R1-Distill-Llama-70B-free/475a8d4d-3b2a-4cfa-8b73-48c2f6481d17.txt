Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a spring-mass system. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that the acceleration of the mass is given as a function of displacement: a(x) = -(k/m)x. The mass starts from rest at a displacement of -ρ. I need to find the velocity as a function of displacement. The options are A to J.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in a spring-mass system, the motion is simple harmonic. The equation a(x) = -(k/m)x is the same as the acceleration for SHM, which is proportional to displacement but opposite in direction. So this makes sense.

Since the mass starts from rest, that means the initial velocity v(0) is zero. Wait, no, because displacement is -ρ. So the initial position is x = -ρ and v = 0 there. So the mass is released from rest at x = -ρ.

I think I should use energy conservation here. In SHM, the total mechanical energy (potential + kinetic) is conserved because there are no frictional forces. So the potential energy at the initial position should equal the sum of potential and kinetic energy at any other position x.

Wait, the potential energy in a spring is (1/2)k x², right? But wait, wait. Actually, the potential energy for a spring is (1/2)k x², where x is the displacement from the equilibrium position. So at the initial position, x is -ρ. But since it's squared, the potential energy at that point is (1/2)k ρ².

As the mass moves, at any point x, the potential energy is (1/2)k x², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)m v². So the total energy is (1/2)k ρ², because initial KE is zero.

So setting up the energy equation: (1/2)k x² + (1/2)m v² = (1/2)k ρ².

I can rearrange this to find v². Let me do that.

Subtract (1/2)k x² from both sides:

(1/2)m v² = (1/2)k (ρ² - x²)

Multiply both sides by 2:

m v² = k (ρ² - x²)

Then divide both sides by m:

v² = (k/m)(ρ² - x²)

So looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this expression.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v² = (ρ² - x²)(k/m) → That's exactly what I have.

Option F says the same thing, because it's written as (ρ² - x²) times k/m.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option A is v² = (rho - x^2) (k/m). No, wait, that can't be right. Because (rho - x squared) would be ρ minus x squared, which is not the same as (rho squared minus x squared). So perhaps I read that wrong.

Looking back, the options:

Option A: (ho - x^2) (k/m) → That's ρ - x² multiplied by k/m. Not the same as (ρ² - x²).

Option F: (ho^2 - x^2) (k/m) → Ah, that's (ρ squared minus x squared) times k/m. So that's the same as my equation.

So the correct answer should be option F.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the letters. The options:

A: v²=(ho -x²)(k/m) → No.

F: v²=(ho² -x²)(k/m) → Yes.

So the answer should be F.

To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the given acceleration \( a(x) = -\frac{k}{m}x \) describes a spring-mass system undergoing simple harmonic motion (SHM). The total mechanical energy in such a system is conserved, as there are no frictional forces. The total energy is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy.

The potential energy of the spring is given by \( U(x) = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 \), where \( x \) is the displacement from the equilibrium position. At the initial position \( x = -\rho \), the mass is at rest, so the initial velocity \( v = 0 \), and the total energy is purely potential energy:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2}k\rho^2.
\]

At any other position \( x \), the total energy is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}k\rho^2.
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( v^2 \):

\[
\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}k(\rho^2 - x^2),
\]

\[
v^2 = \frac{k}{m}(\rho^2 - x^2).
\]

This matches the form of Option F, which is:

\[
v^2 = (\rho^2 - x^2)\frac{k}{m}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**F**
