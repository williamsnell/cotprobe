Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out the correct English interpretation of the given proposition. Let's break it down step by step.

The proposition is: (∀x){Ax ⊃ (∀y)[(Hy • Ly) ⊃ ∼Bxy]} 

First, let's understand the components using the translation key provided.

Ax means "x is an apartment."
Hx means "x is a house."
Lx means "x is large."
Bxy means "x is bigger than y."

So the proposition starts with a universal quantifier for x, which applies to all x. Then, for each x, if x is an apartment (Ax), then it implies something about y. 

The implication is that for all y, if y is a house and y is large (Hy • Ly), then it's not the case that x is bigger than y (∼Bxy). So, putting it together, for every x, if x is an apartment, then for every y that's a large house, x isn't bigger than y.

Wait, let me rephrase that. For any apartment x, and for any large house y, x is not bigger than y. So, all apartments are not bigger than any large house. Or, in other words, no apartment is bigger than any large house.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C says, "No apartment is bigger than any large house." That seems to match what I just thought. Let me check the others to be sure.

Option A: "No large house is bigger than some apartments." Hmm, that's saying there's no large house that's bigger than some apartments. But the original proposition is about apartments not being bigger than large houses. So this seems different.

Option B: "All apartments are not bigger than some large house." Wait, this might be tricky. It could mean that for each apartment, there's at least one large house it's not bigger than. But the original statement says that for every apartment and every large house, the apartment isn't bigger. So B seems weaker because it's only saying not bigger than some, not all.

Option C is stronger, stating that for any apartment and any large house, the apartment isn't bigger. So C seems correct.

Option D: "No large house is bigger than all apartments." That's saying there's no large house that's bigger than every apartment, which is different. The original is about each apartment not being bigger than any large house.

Option E: "All large houses are bigger than any apartment." That's the opposite of what we're saying. The original says apartments aren't bigger than large houses, but this would mean large houses are bigger than apartments, which isn't the same as the original.

Option F: "No apartment is smaller than any large house." This is a bit of a twist. It's talking about being smaller, but the original is about not being bigger. So if an apartment isn't bigger than a large house, it could be smaller or the same size. So F isn't necessarily correct.

Option G: "All large houses are not bigger than some apartment." Again, this is about large houses not being bigger than some apartment, which isn't what the original says.

Option H: "Some apartments are not bigger than all large houses." This seems similar to B but phrased differently. It's about some apartments not being bigger than all large houses, which isn't the same as all apartments not being bigger than any.

Option I: "Some large houses are not bigger than all apartments." This is about some large houses, but the original is about all apartments and all large houses.

Option J: "All apartments are bigger than any large house." That's the opposite of the original statement, so definitely wrong.

So after going through each option, I think option C is the correct interpretation.

The proposition (∀x){Ax ⊃ (∀y)[(Hy • Ly) ⊃ ∼Bxy]} can be interpreted as: "For every apartment x, and for every large house y, x is not bigger than y." This translates to "No apartment is bigger than any large house."

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. It suggests no large house is bigger than some apartments, which is different from the original statement.
- **B**: Incorrect. It states that all apartments are not bigger than some large house, but the original requires apartments not to be bigger than *any* large house.
- **C**: Correct. It matches the interpretation that no apartment is bigger than any large house.
- **D**: Incorrect. It claims no large house is bigger than all apartments, which is not what the original states.
- **E**: Incorrect. It asserts that all large houses are bigger than any apartment, which is the opposite of the original.
- **F**: Incorrect. It talks about apartments being smaller than large houses, which is not directly addressed by the original statement.
- **G**: Incorrect. It focuses on large houses not being bigger than some apartment, which is not the original's focus.
- **H**: Incorrect. It says some apartments are not bigger than all large houses, which is weaker than the original.
- **I**: Incorrect. It discusses some large houses not being bigger than all apartments, which is unrelated to the original.
- **J**: Incorrect. It claims all apartments are bigger than any large house, which is the opposite of the original.

The best interpretation is **C**: "No apartment is bigger than any large house."
