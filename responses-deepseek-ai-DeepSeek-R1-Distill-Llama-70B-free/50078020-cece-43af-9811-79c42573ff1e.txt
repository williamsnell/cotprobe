Question:

What is the major difference between naturalism and positivism?

Options:

A: On the one hand, naturalism is based on a set of rules that are of universal and objective scope and on the other hand, positivism is based on a structured and coherent legal system that is created by States in light of their interests and desires
B: While naturalism serves only the theory human rights law, positivism has a wider and more general scope
C: Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society, while positivism the international rules as such
D: Naturalism is a school of thought advocated outside of Europe, while positivism is Euro-centric theory

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the differences between naturalism and positivism. I'm a bit rusty on these topics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that both naturalism and positivism are legal philosophies, but they have different focuses. Naturalism, from what I recall, is more about natural law. Natural law theories suggest that there's a higher, universal set of principles that dictate what's right and wrong. These principles are thought to be derived from nature, religion, or morality, and they exist independently of human-made laws. So naturalism might say that certain things are inherently right or wrong, regardless of what the laws on the books say.

Positivism, on the other hand, is about positive law, which is law that's been created by humans. Positivists focus on the actual laws and legal systems that societies create. They're more concerned with the rules as they are, enforced by governments and institutions. Positivists might argue that what's legal is determined by the rules set by authority, and that's separate from morality.

Looking at the question, it's asking for the major difference between these two. So I need to figure out which option correctly captures that.

Let's go through the options:

Option A: Says naturalism is based on universal and objective rules, while positivism is based on structured legal systems created by states. That sounds right because naturalism is about universal principles, and positivism is about man-made laws created by states. So this could be a contender.

Option B: Says naturalism only serves human rights law, and positivism is broader. I'm not sure about this. I think both can apply to human rights, but positivism is more general in application, not limited to human rights. But I'm not certain if naturalism is only for human rights. Maybe this is incorrect.

Option C: Naturalism concerns underlying values of international society, positivism the rules. Hmm, this seems plausible. Naturalism is about the values (like justice, fairness), while positivism is about the actual rules that exist. So this could be correct.

Option D: Says naturalism is non-European and positivism is Euro-centric. I don't recall this being a key distinction. Both theories have European roots, I think, so this might not be the right answer.

Now I'm trying to decide between A and C. Let me think again. Naturalism is about universal principles, which are more like underlying values. Positivism is about the actual rules that states create. So option C seems to align with that, because naturalism is about the values (underpinning values) and positivism is about the rules themselves.

Wait, but option A says naturalism is universal and objective rules, which are like natural laws, and positivism is structured legal systems created by states. That also sounds correct because positivism is about man-made laws. So which is it?

I think the key is that naturalism is about the underlying values or principles, while positivism focuses on the actual rules. So option C says naturalism concerns the underpinning values, positivism the rules. That makes sense.

Alternatively, option A is about the source of the rules—natural vs. state-made. So both options could be correct depending on how the question is framed.

Wait, the question is about the major difference. I think the main distinction is that naturalism is about higher moral laws, while positivism is about human-made laws. So option A is talking about the scope and source, while option C is about values vs. rules.

I think the major difference is the source and nature of the law. Naturalism believes in a higher law, whereas positivism focuses on laws created by humans. So option A might be the correct answer because it's contrasting the basis of each—naturalism being universal and objective rules, positivism being state-created structured systems.

But then again, option C is about values vs. rules, which is also a distinction. I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, another approach: natural law is about what the law should be (based on morality), while positivism is about what the law is (based on actual rules). So that would align more with option C, because naturalism is about the underlying values that should guide the law, and positivism is about the existing rules.

So I'm leaning towards option C being correct. But I'm not 100% sure. I think I need to remember what each theory emphasizes. Naturalism is more about the moral principles that law should reflect, whereas positivism is about the actual legal rules as they are, regardless of their moral content.

Yes, so the major difference would be that naturalism is concerned with the underlying values and principles of justice and morality, while positivism focuses on the actual rules and laws that exist in a society, created by human authorities.

So looking back at the options, option C says: "Naturalism concerns the underpinning values of the international society, while positivism the international rules as such." That matches what I was thinking. So I think option C is the correct answer.

The major difference between naturalism and positivism lies in their focus and principles. Naturalism emphasizes universal moral and ethical principles that underpin the law, often derived from nature, morality, or higher values. It concerns itself with what the law should be based on these principles. On the other hand, positivism focuses on the actual legal rules and systems created by human authorities, such as states, emphasizing what the law is rather than what it should be.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** highlights the source of rules, contrasting naturalism's universal principles with positivism's state-created legal systems. While accurate, it doesn't fully capture the core distinction between values and rules.
- **Option B** incorrectly limits naturalism to human rights law, which is not its sole focus.
- **Option C** correctly identifies that naturalism concerns the underpinning values of international society, while positivism focuses on the international rules as they exist. This aligns with the distinction between moral principles and actual legal rules.
- **Option D** incorrectly attributes geographical origins to the theories, which is not a key distinction.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as it accurately reflects the primary difference between naturalism's focus on underlying values and positivism's emphasis on existing legal rules.
