Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about finding the distance between two planes that pass through the centers of adjacent close-packed layers of spheres. All the spheres have the same radius, which is 0.200 nm. Hmm, I remember close-packed structures from my chemistry class, maybe something like hexagonal close packing or face-centered cubic.

Wait, so the spheres are arranged in close-packed layers. Close-packed layers are where each sphere is surrounded by as many others as possible. In each layer, the spheres are arranged in a hexagonal pattern, right? So each sphere touches six others in the same layer.

Now, the problem is about the distance between two such adjacent layers. I need to find the distance between the planes passing through their centers. Let me visualize this. Imagine two layers of spheres, each layer is a hexagonal packing. The next layer is placed in the gaps of the first, so the spheres nestle into the depressions between three spheres below.

I think this is related to the concept of the unit cell in crystals. In a close-packed structure, like hexagonal close packing (HCP) or face-centered cubic (FCC), the layers are arranged in an ABAB... or ABCABC... sequence. But wait, FCC has layers in ABC order, but that's for the cubic system. HCP is ABAB, so maybe this question is about HCP.

But wait, the distance between two adjacent layers—like from layer A to layer B. How is that calculated? I recall that the distance in HCP is the height of the unit cell. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact calculation.

Each sphere has a radius r, which is 0.200 nm here. So the diameter is twice that, 0.400 nm. But the distance between layers isn't simply the diameter, because the layers are offset.

In a close-packed arrangement, the centers of the spheres form a hexagonal lattice. The vertical distance between layers would involve the height of a tetrahedron or perhaps an octahedron.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the unit cell. In HCP, the unit cell is hexagonal. The height (c) of the unit cell is the distance between two adjacent layers. But wait, the unit cell includes two layers, right? So the c parameter is the distance between two layers multiplied by two? Or is it the distance between the same positions in adjacent layers?

No, wait. No, in HCP, the unit cell includes two layers (like A and B), so the height c is the distance from layer A to layer B and then to the next A, making the total height for two layers. Wait, no, I think the c-axis is the distance between two equivalent layers. So in HCP, the unit cell has a height c, which is the distance between two A layers through the B layer. So for two adjacent layers (A and B), the distance would be c/2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this by considering the arrangement of the spheres. The centers of the spheres in adjacent layers are positioned directly above the gaps in the layer below. So the distance between the layers would be the vertical component from the center of a sphere in one layer to the center of a sphere in the next.

Let me try to model this. Imagine two spheres in adjacent layers. The centers are separated by a certain distance. The horizontal component would be the distance from the center of a sphere in the lower layer to the center of the gap where the upper sphere sits.

In a close-packed layer, each sphere has six neighbors in a hexagonal arrangement. The distance between centers in the same layer is 2r (since each sphere touches its neighbor). So the radius of each sphere is 0.200 nm, so diameter is 0.400 nm.

The centers of the spheres in adjacent layers form a tetrahedral arrangement. The centers of two spheres in adjacent layers and their nearest neighbor in the lower layer form a regular tetrahedron. Wait, no, perhaps a different approach. Let's think about the vertical distance between the layers.

In a close-packed structure, the centers of the spheres in adjacent layers are arranged such that each sphere rests in a threefold hollow of the layer below. The triangle formed by three sphere centers in the lower layer is an equilateral triangle with side length 2r. The sphere in the upper layer is positioned above the center of this triangle.

So the centers of the three lower spheres and the upper sphere form a regular tetrahedron. The edge length of this tetrahedron is 2r (the distance between any two centers in the same layer). So the edge length a is 2r.

Wait, no. The edge length is the distance between centers in the same layer, which is 2r (0.400 nm). The vertical distance h between layers is the height of this tetrahedron.

The height H of a regular tetrahedron with edge length a is given by H = sqrt(2/3) * a. Because the height can be found using Pythagoras' theorem in three dimensions. Alternatively, the height is sqrt(a² - ( (a√3)/3 )² ), which simplifies to sqrt(a² - a²/3) = sqrt(2a²/3) )= a*sqrt(2/3).

So substituting a = 2r (0.400 nm), the height h is 0.400 * sqrt(2/3) nm.

Wait, but is that the distance between the two layers? Because the centers are in the two layers separated by this height h. So yes, that's the distance between the two planes.

Let me compute that. sqrt(2/3) is approximately 0.8165. So 0.400 * 0.8165 ≈ 0.3266 nm. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see exactly this number. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: .225 nm

B: .400 nm

C: .5657 nm

D: .200 nm

E: .9798 nm

F: .327 nm

G: .500 nm

H: .150 nm

I: .250 nm

J: .710 nm

Option F is 0.327 nm, which is very close to my calculation. But why isn't it exactly 0.3266? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, let me reevaluate. Maybe the vertical distance isn't the height of the tetrahedron but something else. Another approach: consider the face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, which also has close-packed layers. In FCC, the layers are arranged in ABCABC order. The distance between layers (like from A to B) is a*sqrt(2)/2, where a is the lattice parameter. But wait, the relationship between a and the sphere radius.

In FCC, the relation is that the face diagonal equals 4r. Because in the face of the cube, the diagonal is sqrt(2)*a, and the face diagonal is equal to 4r (since each corner has a sphere of radius r, and the face diagonal spans four radii—each edge is 2r, but wait, that's not right. Wait, the edge length of the cube (a) is related to the radius. In FCC, each edge is such that the face diagonal is 4r. Because each face has atoms at the corners and one in the center. The diagonal of the face would pass through the centers of two corner atoms and the center atom.

Wait, let's think again. In FCC, the atoms touch along the face diagonal. So the face diagonal is 4r. Because each corner atom has radius r, the center atom is also radius r, so the distance between centers is 2r (diameter) for the face diagonal. Wait, no, the face diagonal is the distance between centers along that diagonal. So for a face with edge length a, the diagonal is a*sqrt(2). Along this diagonal, there are two atoms: from corner to center is a vector. Wait, perhaps I should think of the atoms in contact along the face diagonal. So, the face diagonal would be 4r, because from corner to corner through the center, the distance is 4r (each radius is r, so two diameters).

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me step back. In FCC, the atoms are in contact along the face diagonal. So the face diagonal is equal to 4r. Because the face diagonal spans four radii: two from the corner atoms and two from the center.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify. Each atom has a radius r. The centers of two adjacent atoms (touching each other) are 2r apart. So in the face of the cube, the diagonal would have atoms at each corner and the center. The distance between the corner atom and the center atom would be a*(sqrt(2)/2), where a is the edge length. Since the center atom is at (a/2, a/2, 0), and the corner is at (0,0,0). So the distance is sqrt( (a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2 ) = a*(sqrt(2)/2).

But for these atoms to be in contact, this distance should be 2r. So a*(sqrt(2)/2) = 2r → a = (2r * 2)/sqrt(2) )= (4r)/sqrt(2) )= 2*sqrt(2)*r.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps in FCC, the relation between a (edge length) and r is a = 2√2 r.

But wait, another approach: the close-packed layers in FCC are spaced in a particular way. The distance between the layers (like from A to B) can be found using the lattice parameter.

In FCC, the unit cell has a edge length a, and the close-packed layers are along the (111) planes. The distance between two adjacent (111) planes is given by the interplanar spacing d_{111}.

The interplanar spacing d for a plane (hkl) in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²).

So for (111), d = a / sqrt(1+1+1) )= a / sqrt(3).

But in FCC, the relation between a and r is a = 2√2 r. Because the face diagonal is 4r, which equals a√2 → a=4r/√2 = 2√2 r.

So substituting a = 2√2 r into d:

d = (2√2 r) / sqrt(3) )= 2√2 / sqrt(3) * r = 2 * sqrt(2/3) * r.

Wait, so the interplanar distance d_{111} is 2*sqrt(2/3) * r.

Wait, but in the problem, the question is about the distance between two adjacent close-packed layers. In FCC, these layers are the (111) planes, and the distance between them is d_{111}.

So substituting r = 0.200 nm:

d = 2 * sqrt(2/3) * 0.2 nm → let's compute that.

sqrt(2/3) is approximately 0.81649658.

So 2 * 0.81649658 ≈ 1.632993.

Multiply by 0.2: 1.632993 * 0.2 ≈ 0.3265986 nm.

Which is approximately 0.3266 nm. Looking back at the options, option F is 0.327 nm, which matches.

Alternatively, another approach. How about in hexagonal close packing? Let's see. In HCP, the unit cell is hexagonal with parameters a and c. The close-packed layers are along the a and b directions, and the distance between layers is c/2.

Wait, no. In HCP, the unit cell height (c) is the distance between two equivalent layers. So the distance between adjacent layers (A and B) would be c/2.

What's the value of c in terms of a and the radius r?

In HCP, the relationship is c = 2*sqrt(2/3)*a, where a is the distance between adjacent atoms in the close-packed layer. But wait, a is the distance between centers in the same layer, which is 2r.

Wait, a = 2r. So substituting into c:

c = 2*sqrt(2/3) * (2r) )= 4r * sqrt(2/3).

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again.

In HCP, the unit cell has a height c. The close-packed layers are along the c-direction. The distance between two adjacent layers (like the A and B layers) is c/2. But wait, no, the unit cell includes two layers, so the height c is the distance between A and the next A, passing through B. So the distance between A and B is c/2.

But the calculation for c in HCP is c = 2*sqrt(6)/3 * a, where a is the distance between atoms in the same layer (a=2r).

So c = 2*sqrt(6)/3 * 2r → 4r*sqrt(6)/3.

But the distance between adjacent layers (A to B) is c/2 → (4r*sqrt(6)/3)/2 → (2r*sqrt(6))/3.

Wait, let me compute that. Let me plug in r=0.200 nm.

sqrt(6) is approximately 2.4495.

So 2 * 0.200 * 2.4495 /3 → (0.4 * 2.4495)/3 ≈ (0.9798)/3 ≈ 0.3266 nm.

Same result as before. So regardless of whether it's HCP or FCC, the distance between two adjacent close-packed layers is approximately 0.3266 nm, which is option F, 0.327 nm.

So the correct answer should be F.
</think>

To determine the distance between two adjacent close-packed layers of spheres, we analyze the arrangement of the spheres. In a close-packed structure, each sphere touches its neighbors in the same layer, and the centers of the spheres form a hexagonal lattice. The distance between the centers of spheres in the same layer is equal to the diameter of the spheres, which is \( 2r \), where \( r = 0.200 \, \text{nm} \). Thus, the diameter is \( 0.400 \, \text{nm} \).

The distance between adjacent layers is not simply the diameter because the layers are offset. Instead, the centers of the spheres in adjacent layers form a tetrahedral arrangement. The vertical distance between the layers corresponds to the height of a regular tetrahedron with edge length \( a = 2r = 0.400 \, \text{nm} \).

The height \( h \) of a regular tetrahedron is given by:

\[
h = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \cdot a
\]

Substituting \( a = 0.400 \, \text{nm} \):

\[
h = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \cdot 0.400 \, \text{nm}
\]

The value of \( \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \) is approximately \( 0.8165 \), so:

\[
h \approx 0.8165 \cdot 0.400 \, \text{nm} \approx 0.3266 \, \text{nm}
\]

This calculation matches the distance between the planes passing through the centers of adjacent close-packed layers. Among the given options, the closest value is \( 0.327 \, \text{nm} \), which corresponds to option F.
