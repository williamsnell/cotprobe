Okay, so I have this biology question here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about a plant growing in the opposite direction of the gravitational force. Hmm, I remember that plants respond to various stimuli, like light, gravity, touch, chemicals, etc. These responses are called tropisms, right?

Alright, let's break it down. The plant is growing opposite to gravity. So, which tropism is that? I think plants usually grow towards gravity, like roots growing downward. Oh wait, that's called positive geotropism because "geo" means earth or gravity. So if something is positive, it's moving towards the stimulus.

But wait, the question says the plant is growing opposite, so that would be negative. So negative geotropism? But let me think again. Oh wait, maybe the term is gravitropism. Because geotropism and gravitropism are sometimes used interchangeably, both referring to responses to gravity. So negative gravitropism would mean growing away from gravity.

Wait, no, actually, I think gravitropism is the more general term. So a plant growing away from gravity would exhibit negative gravitropism. But let me make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Wait, plants typically show positive gravitropism. For example, roots grow downward (toward gravity) which is positive, and stems grow upward, which is negative gravitropism. Wait, no, that's not right. Stems growing upward would be negative because they're moving away from the gravitational pull. So plants' stems show negative gravitropism.

So in this question, the plant is growing opposite to gravity. So that's negative gravitropism. Let me look back at the options.

Looking at the options, option G is negative gravitropism. So the answer should be G.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing with other tropisms. For instance, phototropism is about light. Positive phototropism is plants growing towards light, like stems bending towards sunlight. But the question is about gravity, not light, so options related to photo can be ruled out.

Chemotropism is about chemicals, like how roots might grow towards certain chemicals. But the question is about gravity; so chemotropism isn't it.

Thigmotropism is response to touch, like how tendrils curl around supports. Not relevant here.

Hydrotropism is response to water. So if a plant grows towards water, that's positive hydrotropism. But the question is about gravity, so that's not it either.

So the only option that fits is G: negative gravitropism.

The question asks about a plant growing in the opposite direction of gravitational force. This behavior is classified as a type of tropism, specifically related to gravity. Plants typically exhibit positive geotropism (or gravitropism), where they grow toward the gravitational stimulus, such as roots growing downward. However, when a plant grows away from gravity, this is termed negative gravitropism. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Positive chemotropism (A)** and **negative chemotropism (D)** relate to responses to chemicals, not gravity.
- **Positive phototropism (B)** and **negative phototropism (C)** pertain to responses to light.
- **Positive hydrotropism (E)** and **negative hydrotropism (J)** involve responses to water.
- **Positive thigmotropism (H)** and **negative thigmotropism (I)** are about responses to touch.
- **Positive geotropism (F)** refers to growth toward gravity, which is the opposite of the scenario described.

The correct answer is **negative gravitropism (G)**, as it describes growth away from the gravitational force.

Answer: G
