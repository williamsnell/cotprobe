Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the future value of an ordinary annuity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

An ordinary annuity means that the payments are made at the end of each period, right? So each year, $800 is paid, and I need to find out what that's worth in four years with a 5% interest rate. 

Wait, the formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity is something like FV = PMT Ã— [(1 + r)^n - 1]/r, right? Or is it a different formula? Oh yeah, I think that's correct. PMT is the annual payment, r is the interest rate per period, and n is the number of periods.

So the PMT here is $800, r is 5%, which is 0.05, and n is 4 years. Plugging the numbers in... Let me write this down.

FV = 800 * [(1 + 0.05)^4 - 1] / 0.05

First, calculate (1 + 0.05) which is 1.05. Then raise that to the 4th power. Let me compute 1.05^4.

1.05^1 = 1.05
1.05^2 = 1.1025
1.05^3 = 1.157625
1.05^4 = 1.21550625

So the numerator becomes 1.21550625 - 1 = 0.21550625.

Now divide that by 0.05: 0.21550625 / 0.05 = 4.310125.

Then multiply by the PMT of 800: 800 * 4.310125.

Let me compute that. 800 * 4 is 3200, and 800 * 0.310125 is... 800 * 0.3 is 240, 800 * 0.010125 is 8.1. So 240 + 8.1 is 248.1. So 3200 + 248.1 is 3448.1.

Wait, looking at the options, option F is 3448.1. So I think that's the answer.

Alternatively, I could have used the future value of annuity factor. The formula is the same, but sometimes tables or financial calculators are used. Let me double-check my calculations.

Recalculating (1.05)^4: 1.05 * 1.05 is 1.1025, times 1.05 is 1.157625, times 1.05 is 1.21550625. That seems correct.

Subtracting 1 gives 0.21550625. Divide by 0.05 gives 4.310125. Multiply by 800 gives 4.310125 * 800.

Wait, 4 * 800 is 3200, 0.310125 * 800 is 248.1, so total is 3448.1. Yep, that checks out.

So I'm confident the correct answer is option F.

To calculate the future value of an ordinary annuity with annual payments of $800 for 4 years at a 5% interest rate, we use the formula:

\[
FV = PMT \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}
\]

Where:
- \( PMT = 800 \)
- \( r = 0.05 \)
- \( n = 4 \)

First, compute \((1 + 0.05)^4\):
\[
1.05^4 = 1.21550625
\]

Subtract 1:
\[
1.21550625 - 1 = 0.21550625
\]

Divide by \( r \):
\[
\frac{0.21550625}{0.05} = 4.310125
\]

Multiply by \( PMT \):
\[
FV = 800 \times 4.310125 = 3448.1
\]

Thus, the future value of the annuity is **3448.1**, which corresponds to option **F**.
