Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down each part.

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate their truthfulness. Then, based on that, pick the correct option from A to J.

Statement 1 says: For n > 1, the set {1,2, ..., n-1} is a group under multiplication modulo n. Hmm, I remember that a group must satisfy four properties: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses for each element.

Closure under multiplication modulo n should hold because multiplying any two numbers in the set and taking mod n will give another number in the set. Associativity is true because multiplication is associative. The identity element is 1, which is in the set.

But wait, the tricky part is about inverses. For every element a in the set, there must exist an element b such that (a*b) mod n = 1. This only happens if a and n are coprime, meaning a has an inverse modulo n. So for the set {1,2,...,n-1}, not every element will have an inverse unless n is prime. Oh wait, no, n doesn't have to be prime. It just needs that a is coprime with n. So if n is composite, some elements in the set won't have inverses. For example, let's take n=4. The set is {1,2,3}. 2 and 4 are not coprime, so 2 doesn't have an inverse modulo 4. So in that case, the set isn't a group because not all elements have inverses.

So Statement 1 is false because it's only true when n is prime, but the statement says for any n>1, which includes composite numbers where it's not a group. So Statement 1 is false.

Now, Statement 2: There is an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1. This is asking if 63 has a multiplicative inverse modulo 100. For an inverse to exist, 63 and 100 must be coprime, meaning their greatest common divisor (gcd) should be 1.

Let me find gcd(63,100). 63 factors into 7*9, and 100 is 2^2*5^2. They share no common prime factors. So yes, their gcd is 1. Therefore, an inverse exists. So Statement 2 is true.

Now, the question is about the options. Let me look at the options again.

Each option gives the truth values for the two statements, and sometimes extra info about x.

So Statement 1 is False, Statement 2 is True.

Looking at the options:

Option A: False, True.

Option C: False, True and x is odd.

Option E: False, True and x is prime.

Option H: True, True. But we know statement1 is false, so H is out.

So from the options, A, C, E are possible.

Now, let's see about the extra info. The question says "and x is..." So in Statement 2, does x have any particular properties?

We need to find x such that 63x â‰¡ 1 mod 100. Let's compute it to find x.

We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for 63 and 100.

Compute gcd(100,63):
100 = 1*63 + 37
63 = 1*37 + 26
37 = 1*26 + 11
26 = 2*11 +4
11 = 2*4 +3
4 = 1*3 +1
3=3*1+0. So gcd is 1.

Now, working backwards to find x and y such that 63x + 100y=1.

Starting from step 6: 1=4 -1*3.

But 3=11 -2*4, so substitute:
1=4 -1*(11 -2*4) = 3*4 -1*11.

Then 4=26 -2*11, substitute:
1=3*(26 -2*11) -1*11 = 3*26 -7*11.

11=37 -1*26, substitute:
1=3*26 -7*(37 -26) =10*26 -7*37.

26=63 -1*37, substitute:
1=10*(63 -37) -7*37 =10*63 -17*37.

37=100 -1*63, substitute:
1=10*63 -17*(100 -63) =27*63 -17*100.

So the equation is 27*63 -17*100 =1, which implies that x=27 is an inverse of 63 mod 100.

But wait, the inverse is 27 modulo 100. So x can be 27, 127, etc., but the smallest positive solution is 27. So x is 27. 

Now, is 27 a prime number? No, 27 is 3^3, so it's not prime. So any option that says x is prime is incorrect.

Is x an odd number? 27 is odd, yes. So option C says Statement 1 is false, Statement 2 true, and x is odd. That matches.

Option A only has the truth values correct but doesn't provide the extra info, but the options require selecting all correct aspects. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, some of them include extra info about x.

Option C: False, True and x is an odd number. So that's correct.

Option E says x is a prime. But since x=27 isn't prime, E is incorrect.

So the correct option would be C: False, True and x is odd.

Wait, but let me double-check if 27 is the inverse. Let me compute 63 *27 mod 100.

63 *27 = 1701. 1701 divided by 100 is 17 remainder 1. So 1701 mod 100 is indeed 1. So yes, x=27 is correct.

So in the options, the correct choice is C.

To evaluate the question, we analyze the two statements and the provided options:

### Statement 1:
The set {1, 2, ..., n-1} is a group under multiplication modulo **n** for **n > 1**.  
For a set to be a group, it must satisfy four properties: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.  
- **Closure**: Multiplication modulo **n** is closed in the set.  
- **Associativity**: Multiplication is associative.  
- **Identity**: The element 1 serves as the identity.  
- **Inverses**: Every element must have an inverse, meaning for each **a** in the set, there must exist a **b** such that \( (a \cdot b) \mod n = 1 \).  

However, not all elements in the set {1, 2, ..., n-1} have inverses unless **a** and **n** are coprime. For example, if \( n = 4 \), the set is {1, 2, 3}, but 2 does not have an inverse modulo 4. Thus, the set is not a group for all \( n > 1 \), only when **n** is prime.  
**Conclusion**: Statement 1 is **False**.

---

### Statement 2:
There is an integer **x** such that \( 63x \mod 100 = 1 \).  
This requires finding an integer **x** that serves as the multiplicative inverse of 63 modulo 100. For an inverse to exist, 63 and 100 must be coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor, gcd, must be 1).  
- The prime factorization of 63 is \( 7 \cdot 9 \), and the prime factorization of 100 is \( 2^2 \cdot 5^2 \).  
- Since 63 and 100 share no common prime factors, their gcd is 1. Therefore, an inverse exists.  

Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that \( x = 27 \) satisfies \( 63 \cdot 27 \mod 100 = 1 \).  
**Conclusion**: Statement 2 is **True**.

---

### Evaluating the Options:
1. **Option A**: False, True.  
   - Correct truth values, but no extra information about **x**.  

2. **Option C**: False, True, and **x** is an odd number.  
   - Correct truth values, and \( x = 27 \), which is odd. This matches.  

3. **Option E**: False, True, and **x** is a prime number.  
   - Incorrect, as \( x = 27 \) is not a prime number.  

4. **Option H**: True, True.  
   - Incorrect, as Statement 1 is False.  

5. Other options are either inconsistent with the truth values or provide incorrect extra information.  

### Final Answer:
The correct choice is **Option C**, as it accurately reflects the truth values of the statements and the property of **x**.  

**Answer: C**
