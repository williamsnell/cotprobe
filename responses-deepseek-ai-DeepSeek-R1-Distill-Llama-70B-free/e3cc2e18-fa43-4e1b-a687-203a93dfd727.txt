Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the tax on a house. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question says the market value is $18,400, and the assessed value is 65% of that. Then there's a tax rate of $4.57 per $100. I need to find the tax amount.

Wait, first I should figure out the assessed value. Oh right, the assessed value is a percentage of the market value. So 65% of $18,400. Let me calculate that. 18,400 times 0.65. Let me see, 18,400 times 0.6 is 11,040, and 18,400 times 0.05 is 920. So adding those together, 11,040 + 920 equals 11,960. So the assessed value is $11,960.

Next, the tax rate is $4.57 per $100 of assessed value. I think that means I need to find out how many hundreds are in $11,960. Oh right, because it's per $100. So I divide 11,960 by 100. That gives me 119.6. Hmm, but tax rates usually apply to each full hundred, or is it just a straight calculation?

Wait, no, I think it's just a straight multiplication. So the tax rate is $4.57 per $100. So for each $100, you pay $4.57. So if the assessed value is $11,960, that's 119.6 times $100. So the tax would be 119.6 multiplied by 4.57.

Let me calculate that. 119.6 times 4.57. Hmm, let's break this down. 120 times 4.57 is easier, but I'll subtract the extra 0.4 times 4.57. Wait, no, maybe I should just do it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can multiply 119.6 by 4.57. Let me write it out as a multiplication problem. 119.6 * 4.57.

Hmm, maybe I can approximate first. 120 * 4.5 is 540. But I need to be precise here. Let me do the exact calculation.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think of 4.57 as 4 + 0.57. So 119.6 * 4 = 478.4, and 119.6 * 0.57. Let's compute that. 119.6 * 0.5 is 59.8, and 119.6 * 0.07 is 8.372. So adding those gives 59.8 + 8.372 = 68.172. Now add that to 478.4: 478.4 + 68.172 = 546.572. So approximately $546.57.

Wait, looking at the options, option J is $546.57. So that must be the correct answer. Let me double-check my steps. Assessed value: 18400 * 0.65 = 11960. Then 11960 / 100 = 119.6, multiplied by 4.57 gives 546.57. Yep, that seems right.

The tax is calculated by first determining the assessed value of the house, which is 65% of the market value. 

1. **Calculate Assessed Value**:  
   Market Value = $18,400  
   Assessed Value = 65% of $18,400 = 0.65 × 18,400 = $11,960  

2. **Determine the Tax Rate Application**:  
   The tax rate is $4.57 per $100 of assessed value. To find the tax, divide the assessed value by 100 and multiply by the tax rate.  
   Tax = ($11,960 ÷ 100) × $4.57 = 119.6 × 4.57  

3. **Perform the Multiplication**:  
   119.6 × 4.57 = $546.57  

Thus, the tax on the house is **$546.57**, which corresponds to option **J**.
