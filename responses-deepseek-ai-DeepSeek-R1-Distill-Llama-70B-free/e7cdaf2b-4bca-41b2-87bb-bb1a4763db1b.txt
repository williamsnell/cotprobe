Question:

An investor owned a four-story office building located in downtown. The building was old and badly in need of renovation. To finance the improvements, the investor borrowed $125,000 from his friend. As consideration for the loan, the investor executed a promissory note for $125,000 payable to the friend in one year and secured by a mortgage on the building. The mortgage was dated January 1, and was recorded January 2. Thereafter, on February 1, the investor executed a deed absolute on the building and named the friend as grantee. This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. In order to make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the investor then delivered the deed to his nephew in escrow with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the investor failed to pay his promissory note at maturity. On January 1 of the following year, the investor failed to pay the note when it came due. Thereupon, the nephew, in accordance with the escrow instructions, delivered the investor's deed on the office building to the friend, which the friend promptly and properly recorded. Two weeks later, the investor tendered the $125,000 indebtedness to the friend. When the friend refused to accept it, the investor brought an appropriate action to set aside and cancel the deed absolute and to permit the redemption of the building from the friend. Conversely, the friend counterclaimed to quiet title and argued that the deed absolute was intended as an outright conveyance upon default. The court should enter a judgment that will grant the relief sought by

Options:

A: the investor, but only if the investor can establish that the mortgage takes precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time.
B: the friend, because the deed absolute effectuated an outright conveyance that extinguished the redemption interest sought to be retained by the investor.
C: the friend, because the investor has no right to redeem after the deed absolute was executed.
D: the friend, if the friend can establish that the deed absolute was executed later in time.
E: the investor, because the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption.
F: the friend, because the investor failed to pay his promissory note at maturity.
G: the investor, because the friend refused to accept the $125,000 indebtedness.
H: the investor, if the investor can prove that the deed was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt.
I: the investor, because the deed absolute was not intended as an outright conveyance upon default.

Okay, I need to solve this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with mortgages, deeds, and the right of redemption. Let me carefully go through the problem and the options.

So, the scenario is an investor who owns a four-story office building. The building is old and needs renovation, so the investor borrows $125,000 from his friend. As security, he executes a promissory note and secures it with a mortgage on the building. The mortgage was dated January 1 and recorded January 2.

Then, on February 1, the investor executes a deed absolute (which is a type of deed that typically conveys absolute ownership without any conditions) naming the friend as the grantee. However, the problem states that this deed was intended only as additional security for the debt, not as an outright transfer. So, this deed absolute is meant to be a mortgage in disguise, perhaps?

Next, the investor wants to avoid judicial foreclosure and eliminate the right to redeem. To do this, he delivers the deed to his nephew in escrow with instructions to deliver it to the friend if the investor fails to pay the promissory note by maturity. So, the escrow arrangement here is conditional: if the investor doesn't pay, the nephew gives the deed to the friend.

Now, on January 1 of the following year, the investor fails to pay the note. The nephew gives the deed to the friend, who records it promptly. Two weeks later, the investor tenders the $125,000 but the friend refuses. The investor sues to set aside the deed and redeem the property, while the friend counters to quiet title, arguing it was an outright conveyance.

The question is about who will win in court. The options are from A to I, each presenting a different legal argument.

I remember that in property law, mortgages can sometimes be structured in different ways. A deed absolute given as security is often treated as a mortgage, especially if the intention is clear. This is because a mortgage typically involves a conditional transfer of the property. If the borrower repays the loan, the lender must reconvey the property. If not, the lender can foreclose.

But wait, in this case, the investor didn't just give the friend a mortgage. He first gave a mortgage (recorded on Jan 2) and then a deed absolute on Feb 1 as additional security. Then, he put that deed in escrow to be delivered upon default. So the question is about the nature of this deed absolute.

I think about the concept of a "mortgage by conveyance." Sometimes, instead of a traditional mortgage where the borrower keeps title, the borrower conveys the title to the lender as security, with a promise to reconvey upon repayment. In that case, the lender has legal title, and the borrower has an equity of redemption.

But in this problem, the initial mortgage was already given. Then the deed absolute was given as additional security. The deed was held in escrow to be delivered upon default, which would transfer title to the friend. So the key issue is whether the deed absolute is treated as a mortgage (thus allowing redemption) or as an outright transfer (so no redemption).

Another important point is whether the deed absolute, when delivered, would extinguish the equity of redemption. Because the investor tried to structure it so that the friend could take the deed without judicial foreclosure, perhaps intending to eliminate redemption. But I'm not sure if that's legally possible.

In some jurisdictions, a conveyance absolute as security is treated as a mortgage, regardless of its form. So the fact that it's absolute in form doesn't matter if the intent was only for security. The court would look beyond the form to the substance. So even if the deed is absolute, if it's intended as security, it's a mortgage, and the borrower retains the equity of redemption.

In this case, the investor delivered the deed to the nephew in escrow with instructions to deliver it upon default. This seems like a conditional delivery. So when the friend gets the deed, it's conditional on default. Therefore, the friend holds it as a mortgage, and the investor should have a right to redeem.

However, the friend argues that the deed absolute was intended as an outright conveyance. But the problem states that the deed was intended as additional security, so the intent is important.

Looking at the options:

Option H says the investor wins if he can prove the deed was intended as additional security. That aligns with the idea that the deed is treated as a mortgage, allowing redemption.

Option E says the investor wins because the deed absolute didn't extinguish his right of redemption. That might be correct if the deed is considered a mortgage, in which case the right of redemption exists.

Option I says the investor wins because the deed wasn't intended as an outright conveyance. That's similar to H and E.

Option B says the friend wins because the absolute deed caused an outright conveyance, extinguishing redemption. But if the deed is treated as a mortgage, that's not the case.

So, the main issue is whether the deed absolute is treated as a mortgage or an outright transfer.

In many jurisdictions, a deed absolute given as security is treated as a mortgage. So the investor would have an equity of redemption, meaning he can pay the debt to get the property back, even after the deed was delivered.

So, the friend's argument that it's an outright conveyance would fail because the intent was for security, not an outright transfer. Therefore, the investor should be able to redeem.

But wait, in this case, the friend didn't get the deed until after the default. So the deed was delivered upon default, which is a bit different than a typical mortgage by conveyance, where the conveyance happens upfront.

In a typical mortgage by conveyance, the borrower conveys the property to the lender at the time of the loan, with a promise to reconvey upon payment. Here, the borrower first gave a mortgage (which is a lien), and then a deed absolute in escrow as additional security. So when the escrow condition is met (default), the deed is delivered.

So, is this structure more akin to a mortgage, or does it become an outright transfer upon delivery?

I think the key is that the deed was intended as security, so even if delivered upon default, it's treated as a mortgage, allowing redemption. So the investor can still pay the debt and get the property back.

Thus, the court should allow the investor to redeem. So the judgment would be in favor of the investor, which would mean the friend has to return the deed upon payment.

Looking again at the options:

Option E: investor, because deed absolute didn't extinguish right of redemption.

Option H: investor, if he can prove the deed was intended as additional security.

Option I: investor, because deed wasn't intended as outright conveyance.

All these options suggest the investor wins, but under different reasoning.

In the problem, the intent is clear that the deed was additional security, so the court should treat it as a mortgage. Therefore, the investor retains the right to redeem.

So, the correct answer would be either E, H, or I.

Option E says the deed didn't extinguish the right of redemption. That's correct because a mortgage (even if through a deed absolute) allows redemption.

Option H says the investor wins if he can prove the deed was intended as additional security. Since the problem states that the deed was intended as additional security, H is correct.

Option I says the investor wins because the deed wasn't intended as an outright conveyance, which is similar.

But the options might hinge on the nuances of whether the right of redemption exists after the deed is delivered.

Wait, when the deed is delivered upon default, does it transfer ownership, thereby eliminating the equity of redemption? Or is the equity of redemption preserved regardless?

In a typical mortgage, even after default, the borrower has a certain period (depending on jurisdiction) to redeem. If the lender forecloses, the borrower's equity is cut off. But in this case, the investor is trying to pay before foreclosure, so perhaps the right still exists.

But in this case, the deed was delivered upon default, so the friend now holds legal title. However, if the deed is treated as a mortgage, the investor still has the equity of redemption, which allows him to pay the debt and get the property back.

So, the investor should be able to redeem, meaning the court would set aside the deed and allow redemption. Therefore, the judgment would be in favor of the investor.

Looking back, the options:

Option E: investor, because deed absolute didn't extinguish right of redemption.

Option H: investor, if he can prove the deed was intended as additional security.

Which is the better option? Since the problem states that the deed was intended as additional security, the court would likely treat it as a mortgage, thus preserving the right of redemption.

So, the correct answer would be either E or H.

Option E is more about the effect (right of redemption exists despite the deed), while H is about the intent (if the investor can prove it was for security).

But in the problem, the intent is given as fact: the deed was intended as additional security. So the investor doesn't need to prove it because it's stated. Therefore, the judgment should favor the investor because the deed was intended as security, making it a mortgage, thus allowing redemption.

Wait, but the options don't all state that. Option E is a statement of law, not dependent on the investor proving intent. Option H is conditional on the investor proving intent, but in the problem, the intent is already provided.

Wait, no, in the problem, the facts are that the deed was intended as additional security. So the court would know that. So the investor doesn't need to prove it beyond what's stated in the facts.

Therefore, the judgment should be for the investor because the deed was intended as security, making it a mortgage, so the right of redemption exists. Thus, the correct answer would be H, but wait, no—option H says "if the investor can prove the deed was intended as additional security." Since the problem states the intent, perhaps the court will recognize it, making option H correct because the investor can prove it (as it's given in the facts).

Alternatively, option E doesn't require proof because it's a matter of law that such a deed doesn't extinguish the right of redemption.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The key point is that a deed absolute, when used as security, is treated as a mortgage. Therefore, the right of redemption is preserved. So even though the form is an absolute deed, the substance is a mortgage, so redemption is possible.

Therefore, the investor can redeem, so the court should rule in his favor. So the correct option is either E, H, or I.

Looking at the options:

Option E: The investor, because the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption.

Option H: The investor, if he can prove the deed was intended as additional security.

Option I: The investor, because the deed absolute was not intended as an outright conveyance.

Given the facts, the intent is clear, so the court would treat it as a mortgage, thus the investor can redeem. So, the judgment is for the investor.

Between E, H, and I, which is the best fit.

Option E seems to be a statement of the legal effect, regardless of intent. Option H and I are about the intent.

But in the law, the intent is crucial. If the deed is intended as a mortgage, then it's treated as such. So the investor would need to establish that intent.

Wait, but the facts say that the deed was intended as additional security, so the court would accept that. Therefore, the investor would succeed because the deed was intended as security, making it a mortgage.

So the correct answer is H or I.

Option I says the investor wins because the deed was not intended as an outright conveyance. That's another way of saying it's a mortgage, so yes.

But the options might be trying to test the knowledge that a deed absolute as security is a mortgage, allowing redemption.

So the correct answer is H: the investor, if he can prove the deed was intended as additional security. But since the problem states the intent, the investor can prove it, so H applies.

Wait, but the problem says the deed was intended as additional security, so H's condition is met. Therefore, the court would rule in the investor's favor.

Alternatively, option E says the deed didn't extinguish the right of redemption, which is a correct statement of law, but perhaps E is too broad.

Wait, maybe E is correct because regardless of the intent, a deed absolute as security doesn't extinguish the right of redemption. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, the right of redemption exists when the conveyance is treated as a mortgage. So the key is whether the deed is treated as a mortgage, which depends on intent.

So, the correct answer is H because the investor can prove the intent, making the deed a mortgage, thus allowing redemption.

But let me make sure. If the deed is absolute but intended as security, it's a mortgage, so the borrower has an equity of redemption. Therefore, when the borrower tenders payment, the lender must return the property.

So, the friend's refusal to accept payment was wrong, and the court should allow the investor to redeem.

Therefore, the correct answer is H: the investor, if he can prove the deed was intended as additional security.

But wait, the problem says the deed was intended as additional security, so the investor can prove that. Therefore, the judgment is for the investor.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions may treat a deed in escrow as a mortgage, and the delivery upon default doesn't change that. So the right of redemption exists.

So, the correct answer is H.

The question revolves around a property law issue involving a mortgage, a deed absolute, and the right of redemption. The investor borrowed $125,000 from his friend, securing the loan with a mortgage recorded on January 2. On February 1, the investor executed a deed absolute as additional security, which was held in escrow. The deed was to be delivered to the friend upon default. The investor defaulted on January 1 of the following year, and the deed was delivered to the friend, who recorded it. The investor later tendered the debt, but the friend refused to accept it. The investor sued to set aside the deed and redeem the property, while the friend argued the deed was an outright conveyance.

The key issue is whether the deed absolute, intended as additional security, is treated as a mortgage or an outright transfer. Under property law, a deed absolute given as security is often treated as a mortgage, preserving the borrower's equity of redemption. The intent behind the deed is crucial: if it was intended as security, it is treated as a mortgage, allowing the borrower to redeem the property upon repayment of the debt.

Given the facts, the deed was explicitly intended as additional security, not an outright conveyance. Therefore, it should be treated as a mortgage, and the investor retains the right to redeem the property. The friend's refusal to accept payment was improper, as the investor's equity of redemption remains intact.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The mortgage's priority over the deed is irrelevant because the deed is treated as part of the security arrangement.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The deed absolute does not automatically extinguish the right of redemption if it is treated as a mortgage.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The investor retains the right to redeem if the deed is treated as a mortgage.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The timing of the deed's execution does not determine its treatment as a mortgage or outright conveyance.
- **Option E**: Correct in substance but less precise. While the deed absolute does not extinguish the right of redemption, the reasoning should focus on the intent behind the deed.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The investor's default does not automatically make the deed an outright conveyance.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The friend's refusal to accept payment is not the determining factor; the investor's right to redeem exists regardless.
- **Option H**: Correct. The investor can prove the deed was intended as additional security, treating it as a mortgage and allowing redemption.
- **Option I**: Correct in substance but less precise. The deed was not intended as an outright conveyance, but the focus should be on proving the intent to treat it as additional security.

The best answer is **Option H**, as it directly addresses the intent behind the deed and aligns with the legal principle that a deed absolute, when intended as security, is treated as a mortgage, preserving the right of redemption.

Answer: H
