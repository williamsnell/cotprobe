Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about autocorrelation and statistical significance. Hmm, I remember that autocorrelation has to do with the correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself. The question gives me coefficients for lags 1, 2, and 3, and asks which are significant at the 5% level.

The coefficients are: Lag 1 is 0.2, Lag 2 is -0.15, and Lag 3 is -0.1. Oh wait, but how do I determine their significance?

I think about hypothesis testing here. For autocorrelation, the null hypothesis is that the true autocorrelation is zero. So we're testing whether each coefficient is significantly different from zero.

Assuming the coefficients are normally distributed, which they are here as per the question. So I can use a standard normal test. The critical value for a two-tailed test at 5% significance (since we're testing both positive and negative deviations) would be around 1.96.

But wait, what's the standard error? Oh, right, for autocorrelation coefficients, the standard error (SE) is approximately 1 over the square root of the number of observations. Oh wait, the sample size is 250. So SE = 1/sqrt(250).

Calculating that... sqrt(250) is about 15.81, so 1/15.81 is approximately 0.0632. So each coefficient's standard error is about 0.0632.

Now, the z-score for each coefficient is (coefficient / SE). Let's compute each:

For Lag 1: 0.2 / 0.0632 ≈ 3.16. That's way above 1.96, so it's significant.

Lag 2: -0.15 / 0.0632 ≈ -2.37. The absolute value is 2.37, which is higher than 1.96, so this is also significant.

Lag 3: -0.1 / 0.0632 ≈ -1.58. That's below 1.96, so not significant.

Wait, but wait a minute. The question says "assuming the coefficients are approximately normally distributed" and that we can use the normal distribution for testing. So the approach is correct.

So out of the three lags, lags 1 and 2 are significant, while lag 3 isn't.

Now looking at the options, option I says "1 and 2 only". Option E is only 1, but that's not right because Lag 2 is also significant.

Wait, but let me double-check the standard error. Oh, yes, for autocorrelation, especially when the data is not serially correlated, the standard error is 1/sqrt(n) for each lag. But wait, that's only true under certain conditions, like when there's no autocorrelation beyond lag 0. But since we're considering the sample autocorrelations, maybe there's a different formula.

Wait, another approach: the standard error for the sample autocorrelation at lag k is approximately sqrt( (1 + 2∑ρ^2) / n ), where ρ is the true autocorrelation. But if the true autocorrelation is zero beyond lag 0, then the SE is sqrt(1/n). So for our case, assuming no true autocorrelation beyond lag 0, SE is 1/sqrt(250), which is about 0.0632 as before.

So the calculations hold. So Lag 1 and 2 are significant. So option I is correct.

But wait, looking back at the options, option I says 1 and 2 only. So that would be the correct choice.

Wait, but I just recalled something. Oh, wait, the Bartlett formula for standard errors in autocorrelation says that under the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation, the variance of the sample autocorrelation is 1/n. So yeah, SE is 1/sqrt(n), which is what I used.

So, the conclusion is that only lags 1 and 2 are significant. So the answer should be option I.

To determine which autocorrelation coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level, we start by noting that the null hypothesis is that the true autocorrelation coefficient is zero. The coefficients provided are:

- Lag 1: 0.2  
- Lag 2: -0.15  
- Lag 3: -0.1  

The sample size is 250, and the standard error (SE) for autocorrelation coefficients under the null hypothesis is approximately \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \), which equals \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{250}} \approx 0.0632 \).

The z-scores for each coefficient are calculated as:

- **Lag 1**: \( z = \frac{0.2}{0.0632} \approx 3.16 \)  
- **Lag 2**: \( z = \frac{-0.15}{0.0632} \approx -2.37 \)  
- **Lag 3**: \( z = \frac{-0.1}{0.0632} \approx -1.58 \)  

At the 5% significance level, the critical z-value for a two-tailed test is \( \pm 1.96 \). Comparing the absolute z-scores:

- Lag 1: \( |z| = 3.16 > 1.96 \) → Significant  
- Lag 2: \( |z| = 2.37 > 1.96 \) → Significant  
- Lag 3: \( |z| = 1.58 < 1.96 \) → Not Significant  

Thus, only the coefficients at lags 1 and 2 are statistically significant. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**I: 1 and 2 only**
