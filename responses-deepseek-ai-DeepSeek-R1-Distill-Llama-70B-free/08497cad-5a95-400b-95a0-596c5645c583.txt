Okay, so I've got this question about Peter Singer and his arguments. The question is asking why he presents his three-premise argument along with the case of the drowning child. I remember that Singer uses both logical arguments and emotional examples in his work. Let me try to break this down.

First, Singer's three-premise argument is a logical, step-by-step approach. I think the premises go something like: if you can prevent something bad without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, you should do it. Applying that globally, people in affluent countries should help those in need. So that's the abstract, logical part.

Then there's the drowning child example, which is more emotional. It paints a vivid picture: if you saw a child drowning in a pond and you could save them without any real sacrifice, wouldn't you do it? Most people would say yes. Then he extends that to children suffering in other parts of the world due to poverty or disasters, arguing that the moral obligation is the same.

So why does he use both? I think it's because he wants to appeal to both reason and emotion. The three premises are for the logical, rational part of the reader's mind. They follow a clear structure and are based on moral principles. The drowning child, though, is an emotional appeal. It's a relatable scenario that makes the reader feel the moral imperative more strongly.

Looking at the options:

A: Says moral claims can only be justified through reasoning and examples. Not sure if it's "only"; maybe he's using both but not necessarily saying they're the only ways.

B: Thinks abstract arguments convince more. But he uses both, so maybe this isn't the reason.

C: Wants a balanced perspective. That sounds possible, but I'm not sure if it's about balance or effectiveness.

D: Appeals to reason, not just emotions. But he does use emotions too, so maybe this isn't it.

E: Shows obligations from both rational and emotional. This seems close, as he's using both types of appeal.

F: Arguments are more efficient for emotions. Doesn't seem right; arguments are usually for reason.

G: Drowning child makes it more relatable. That's true, but why present both? It's part of the reason but perhaps not the whole.

H: Emotional reactions don't affect moral claims. No, because he does use emotions to make a point.

I: Appeals to both logical and emotional. That fits because he's using both types of appeals.

J: Combination is more effective. This also makes sense, as using both might be more persuasive.

Wait, the question is about why he presents both the argument and the example. So the options are about his reason for using both methods.

Option E says he wants to show that obligations come from both rational and emotional. That makes sense because the argument is rational, the example emotional.

Option I says he's appealing to both aspects. So he's addressing both parts of the mind.

Option J says a combination is more effective. That's a possible reason—using both makes the argument stronger.

Hmm. So which is it? The question says, "in addition to appealing to the case," so why add the argument?

Wait, the three-premise argument is the abstract part, and the drowning child is the emotional. So the reason is that he wants to engage both reason and emotion. So the answer would be either E, I, or J.

Looking back, E is about showing obligations arise from both. I is about appealing to both aspects. J is about combination being more effective.

The question is about why he uses both. So perhaps he's using both methods to make the argument more convincing by addressing both the logical and emotional sides. So J says the combination is more effective. Or I, which is about appealing to both.

Alternatively, E is about the origin of obligations, which may not directly answer why he uses both methods.

So between I and J. The question is asking why he presents both—so maybe it's about appealing to both aspects (I), or because the combination is more effective (J).

In the context of the question, the answer is likely J: he thinks a combination is more effective. Because using both reason and emotion would make the argument more persuasive than either alone.

Wait, but another angle: the three premises are the argument, and the example is an application. So together, they provide both the logical structure and the emotional impact. So the reason is to appeal to both the logical and emotional parts, which is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps he wants to show that the conclusion is supported both by reason and by emotion, making it more convincing.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn here. Let me think about the structure of Singer's argument. He starts with the logical premises and then illustrates with the drowning child. So he's building a rational case and then making it relatable emotionally. So perhaps he wants to ensure that the reader is both logically convinced and emotionally moved, making the argument more compelling overall.

So the correct answer would be that he wants to appeal to both the logical and emotional aspects, which is option I. Or maybe J, which is about the combination being more effective.

Wait, the question is why he presents both. The options are about his reasons.

Option I says he aims to appeal to both the logical and emotional aspects. That sounds correct.

Alternatively, option E says he shows obligations from both. But the way the question is phrased, it's about why he presents both the argument and the example, not about the source of obligations.

So I think the answer is either I or J.

Another thought: The question says, Singer presents his three-premise argument "in addition to" the case. So why add the example? Because he wants to make the argument more relatable and emotionally engaging, thereby making it more persuasive.

So perhaps the reason is that the combination is more effective, which is option J.

Wait, but option G says the case makes it more relatable, which is true, but that's just one part of why.

Alternatively, the reason is to show that moral obligations come from both rational and emotional responses, which is E.

I think I need to look up the structure of Singer's argument. Singer's original argument in "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" starts with the three premises, then uses the drowning child as an example to make the point more vivid. He's trying to show that the same moral principles apply both locally and globally. So by using both, he's appealing to the reader's reason (the premises) and their emotions (the example), making the argument more compelling.

So the reason is to combine both approaches for a stronger impact. That points to option J: a combination is more effective than either alone.

But another angle: does he present both to show that the obligations arise from both reasoning and emotion? That's option E.

Wait, the question is about why he presents both. So perhaps he's trying to support his argument both logically and emotionally, making it more convincing. So that would be option E: obligations from both.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, option I says he wants to appeal to both aspects, which makes sense because he's using both methods.

In the end, I think the correct answer is I or J. Hmm.

I'll go with I: he aims to appeal to both the logical and emotional aspects of the reader's mind.

Singer presents his three-premise argument alongside the case of the drowning child to engage both the logical and emotional aspects of the reader's mind. The three-premise argument provides a rational, step-by-step foundation for his moral claims, while the drowning child example serves as an emotional appeal to make the argument more relatable and impactful. By combining these two approaches, Singer aims to create a more persuasive case by addressing both reason and emotion. This dual strategy ensures that the argument is not only logically sound but also emotionally compelling, making it more effective in convincing the reader.

The correct answer is **I: he aims to appeal to both the logical and emotional aspects of the reader's mind.**

Answer: I
