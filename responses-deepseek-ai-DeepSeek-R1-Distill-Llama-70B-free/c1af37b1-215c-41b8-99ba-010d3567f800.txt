Question:

Johnstown Mills manufactures cotton fabrics. Overhead is allocated to each department according to the ratio of total overhead to the total prime cost. During February, total direct labor costs came to $216,000 and the cost of materials to $84,000. The total overhead for the month was $45,000. Find the overhead percent of prime cost to be charged to each department. Then find the amount of overhead to be charged to the Design Department with a prime cost of $18,500.

Options:

A: 20%, $3,700
B: 22%, $4,070
C: 18%, $3,330
D: 30%, $5,550
E: 10%, $1,850
F: 25%, $4,625
G: 28%, $5,180
H: 15%, $2,775
I: 35%, $6,475
J: 12%, $2,220

Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully first.

The problem is about Johnstown Mills, which manufactures cotton fabrics. They allocate overhead to each department based on the ratio of total overhead to total prime cost. In February, the direct labor costs were $216,000, and materials cost was $84,000. Total overhead for the month was $45,000. I need to find two things: the overhead percent of prime cost to be charged to each department, and then the amount of overhead to be charged to the Design Department, which has a prime cost of $18,500.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I should calculate the total prime cost. Prime cost is the sum of direct materials cost and direct labor cost. So, direct materials are $84,000, and direct labor is $216,000. Adding those together should give me the total prime cost.

So, $84,000 plus $216,000 equals... let's see, 84k + 216k is 300k. So the total prime cost is $300,000.

Next, the problem mentions that overhead is allocated according to the ratio of total overhead to total prime cost. So, I think that means the overhead percentage is calculated by dividing the total overhead by the total prime cost and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

The total overhead for the month is $45,000. So, the overhead percentage would be (45,000 / 300,000) * 100. Let me compute that. 45 divided by 300 is 0.15, and 0.15 times 100 is 15%. So the overhead percent is 15%.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Let me make sure I'm doing that right. Because sometimes overhead application is based on a different base, but here the problem says it's the ratio of total overhead to total prime cost. So yes, that's correct. 45k divided by 300k is 0.15, so 15% overhead rate.

Now, the second part is to find the amount of overhead charged to the Design Department, which has a prime cost of $18,500. So, I think I need to apply the 15% overhead rate to this department's prime cost.

So, 15% of $18,500 is calculated as 0.15 * 18,500. Let me compute that. 18,500 times 0.15. Hmm, 10% of 18,500 is 1,850, and 5% is half of that, which is 925. So 1,850 plus 925 is 2,775. So the overhead charged would be $2,775.

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. 18,500 * 0.15. Alternatively, 18,500 * 15% is the same as 18,500 * 3/20, which is (18,500 รท 20) * 3. 18,500 รท 20 is 925, and 925 * 3 is indeed 2,775. So that's correct.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which option matches 15% and $2,775. Let me look through the options:

Option H says 15%, $2,775. So that's the one.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recap:

Total direct labor: $216k
Total materials: $84k
Total prime cost: 216 + 84 = 300k
Total overhead: 45k
Overhead percentage: (45/300)*100 = 15%
Design Department's prime cost: $18,500
Overhead charged: 15% of 18,500 = 2,775.

Yes, that all adds up. So the correct answer should be option H.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the total prime cost by adding the direct labor costs and direct materials costs:

\[
\text{Total Prime Cost} = \$216,000 + \$84,000 = \$300,000
\]

Next, we determine the overhead percentage by dividing the total overhead by the total prime cost and multiplying by 100:

\[
\text{Overhead Percentage} = \left(\frac{\$45,000}{\$300,000}\right) \times 100 = 15\%
\]

Now, we calculate the overhead to be charged to the Design Department, which has a prime cost of \$18,500, by applying the overhead percentage:

\[
\text{Overhead Charged} = 0.15 \times \$18,500 = \$2,775
\]

Thus, the overhead percentage is 15%, and the overhead charged to the Design Department is \$2,775. Comparing this with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**H: 15%, $2,775**

H
