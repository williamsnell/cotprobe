Question:

This question refers to the following information.
On Being Brought from Africa to America
'Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land,
Taught my benighted soul to understand
That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too;
Once I redemption neither sought nor knew.
Some view our sable race with scornful eye,
"Their colour is a diabolic die."
Remember, Christians, Negroes, black as Cain,
May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.

Alright, I need to figure out which option best compares to the point of Phillis Wheatley's poem. Let me start by understanding the poem itself.

The poem, "On Being Brought from Africa to America," speaks about being brought from a pagan land and taught about God and a Savior. Wheatley emphasizes that despite being black, she can be refined and join the angels. This seems to be a defense against racial prejudice, arguing that skin color doesn't determine one's worth or ability to be saved.

Looking at the options, I need to find a work that similarly addresses racial equality and the inherent worth of oppressed groups. Let's go through them one by one.

A: Malcolm X's "The Ballot or the Bullet" speech. Malcolm X was about empowerment and using any means necessary, which is more militant. Doesn't seem to match the hopeful, inclusive tone of Wheatley's poem.

B: Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream” speech. King's speech is about equality and unity, envisioning a future where people are judged by character, not color. This seems close because both are arguing for equality and challenging racial stereotypes.

C: Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. This was a political document ending slavery, not a speech about equality or moral worth, so probably not the best fit.

D: Seneca Falls Declaration. This is about women's rights, so while it's a rights movement, it's gender-focused, not race.

E: Thomas Paine's "Common Sense." This is about American independence from Britain, not race issues.

F: Nelson Mandela's speech. He fought against apartheid, similar to racial issues, but I'm not sure how it directly compares to Wheatley's point about religious and moral equality.

G: Frederick Douglass's speech. He critiques the hypocrisies of celebrating freedom while slavery exists. It's a powerful message, but Douglass is more confrontational, whereas Wheatley seems to be appealing to shared religious values.

H: Jonathan Edwards's sermon. This is a Puritan sermon about sin and salvation, not addressing race at all.

I: JFK's Berlin speech. It's about supporting democracy in Berlin, unrelated to race.

J: Declaration of Independence. While it states all men are created equal, it's a founding document, not specifically addressing the same themes as Wheatley, who is countering racial stereotypes directly.

So, the closest comparison would be Martin Luther King Jr.'s speech because both address racial equality and challenge prejudice, advocating for inclusion and dignity based on shared humanity. Both use hopeful, inspiring language to promote unity and equality.

The poem by Phillis Wheatley challenges racial stereotypes and argues for the equal spiritual and moral worth of Black individuals, appealing to shared religious values. Among the options, Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream” speech similarly advocates for racial equality and envisions a future of unity and mutual respect, making it the best comparison.

Answer: B
