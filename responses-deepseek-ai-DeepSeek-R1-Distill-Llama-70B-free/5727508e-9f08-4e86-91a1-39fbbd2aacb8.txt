Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Dani has 45 marbles, and she has 5 times as many as Joe. The question is asking how many marbles Joe has. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll try to understand the relationship between the number of marbles Dani and Joe have. The problem says Dani has 5 times as many marbles as Joe. So if Joe has a certain number, say X marbles, then Dani has 5 times X.

Let me write that down as an equation. Let's let J represent the number of marbles Joe has. So Dani's marbles would be 5 times J, which is 5J.

The problem states that Dani has 45 marbles. So I can set up the equation like this: 5J = 45. Now, I need to solve for J to find out how many marbles Joe has.

To solve for J, I should get J by itself on one side of the equation. Since it's multiplied by 5, I can do the opposite operation, which is division. So I'll divide both sides of the equation by 5.

5J divided by 5 is just J, and 45 divided by 5 is 9. So J equals 9.

Wait, let me double-check that. If Joe has 9 marbles, then 5 times that is 45, which matches what Dani has. That makes sense.

Looking at the options provided, option J is 9. So the correct answer should be J.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's a straightforward division problem once I set up the equation correctly. So yeah, Joe has 9 marbles.

The problem states that Dani has 45 marbles, which is 5 times the number Joe has. Let J represent Joe's marbles. The equation is 5J = 45. Solving for J gives J = 45 / 5 = 9. Therefore, Joe has 9 marbles.

Answer: J
