Okay, so I have this problem about array displacement in lexicographic order. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

Alright, the array is A with dimensions 10x10x10. So, each dimension has 10 elements. The elements are stored in lexicographic order of their indices. Lex order is like dictionary order, right? So for a 3D array, the first index varies the slowest, and the third index the fastest. Wait, no, wait. Lex order for 3D arrays—let me think. Oh right, in lexicographic order, you iterate through the last dimension the fastest. So for a 3D array, the order is such that the third index (let's say k) changes first, then j, then i. So the layout is A[i][j][k], and when you increment k, it's the next element in memory.

Wait no, I might have that backwards. Let me clarify. Lex order for multi-dimensional arrays can be a bit confusing. In row-major order, which is common in programming, the rightmost index varies fastest. So for a 3D array, each element A[i][j][k] is stored such that k increases first. So the memory layout goes A[1][1][1], A[1][1][2], ..., A[1][1][10], then A[1][2][1], etc. Wait, but the problem says lexicographic order of their indices. So lex order would order the tuples (i,j,k) in lex order. So the order is first by i, then j, then k. So the first i is 1, and the elements run through all j and k for that i before moving to i=2. But wait, that's not right. Wait, no—lexicographic order for the indices would be ordered by i first, then j, then k. So for i=1, j runs from 1 to 10, and for each j, k runs from 1 to 10. So the elements would be ordered as (1,1,1), (1,1,2), ... (1,1,10), (1,2,1), (1,2,2)... up to (1,10,10), then (2,1,1), and so on up to (10,10,10).

Wait, but in that case, the array is stored in a way where i is the slowest varying index, j next, and k the fastest. So the displacement would be calculated by considering how many elements are before a given (i,j,k) in this order.

To find the displacement of a given element relative to A(1,1,1), which is the first element, I need to compute how many elements come before it. The displacement would be the count of elements before it, because each element is stored contiguously.

So for a general (i,j,k), the number of elements before it would be:

(i-1)*10*10 + (j-1)*10 + (k-1). 

Because for each i, there are 10*10 elements. Then for each j in the current i, 10 elements. Then k counts up from 1.

So the displacement is (i-1)*100 + (j-1)*10 + (k-1).

Wait, but wait—since arrays are 1-based here. So for example, A(1,1,1) has zero elements before it, displacement 0. A(1,1,2) would have 1 element before, displacement 1. A(1,2,1) would have 10 elements before (since for j=1, k runs 1-10, then j=2 starts with k=1). So yes, the formula makes sense.

Wait, but let me test with i=2, j=1, k=1. The number of elements before would be 10*10 = 100. So yes, displacement is 100. Which matches (2-1)*100 + (1-1)*10 + (1-1) = 100.

So the formula is correct.

Now, I need to compute the displacement for each of the three points given.

Problem (a): A(5,6,7)
So i=5, j=6, k=7.

Compute: (5-1)*100 + (6-1)*10 + (7-1) = 4*100 +5*10 +6 = 400 +50 +6=456.

So displacement is 456.

Problem (b): A(10,9,8)
i=10, j=9, k=8.

(10-1)*100 + (9-1)*10 + (8-1) =9*100=900, 8*10=80, 7. So 900+80+7=987.

So displacement is 987.

Problem (c): A(1,5,9)
i=1, j=5, k=9.

(1-1)*100 + (5-1)*10 + (9-1)= 0 +40 +8=48.

So the three displacements are 456, 987, 48.

Looking at the options, which option has these three numbers?

Option C: 456,987,48.

Option G: 546,987,48.

Wait, let's check again. Let me make sure I did the calculations correctly.

For (a): 5,6,7.

(5-1) =4 → 4*100=400.

(6-1)=5 →5*10=50.

(7-1)=6 →6.

Total 400+50=450 +6=456. Correct.

For (b): 10,9,8.

(10-1)=9 →9*100=900.

(9-1)=8 →8*10=80.

(8-1)=7.

900+80=980 +7=987. Correct.

For (c): 1,5,9.

(1-1)=0 →0.

(5-1)=4 →4*10=40.

(9-1)=8.

40+8=48. Correct.

So the triplet is 456,987,48. Looking at the options:

Option C says 456,987,48.

Option G is 546,987,48. So C is correct.

So the answer would be option C.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the displacements of the given elements relative to A(1,1,1) in a 10x10x10 array stored in lexicographic order. In lexicographic order, the elements are stored such that the first index (i) varies the slowest, the second index (j) next, and the third index (k) the fastest. The displacement of an element A(i,j,k) relative to A(1,1,1) is given by:

\[
\text{Displacement} = (i-1) \cdot 10 \cdot 10 + (j-1) \cdot 10 + (k-1)
\]

### Calculations:
1. **For A(5,6,7):**
   \[
   (5-1) \cdot 100 + (6-1) \cdot 10 + (7-1) = 4 \cdot 100 + 5 \cdot 10 + 6 = 400 + 50 + 6 = 456
   \]

2. **For A(10,9,8):**
   \[
   (10-1) \cdot 100 + (9-1) \cdot 10 + (8-1) = 9 \cdot 100 + 8 \cdot 10 + 7 = 900 + 80 + 7 = 987
   \]

3. **For A(1,5,9):**
   \[
   (1-1) \cdot 100 + (5-1) \cdot 10 + (9-1) = 0 \cdot 100 + 4 \cdot 10 + 8 = 0 + 40 + 8 = 48
   \]

Thus, the displacements are **456, 987, and 48**.

### Matching with Options:
The option that matches these displacements is **C: 456, 987, 48**.
