Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says to express 2/5 and 1/100 as a percentage. Hmm, I remember that converting fractions to percentages is something I've learned before, but I'm a bit rusty, so I'll need to think carefully.

Alright, let's start with the first part: 2/5 as a percentage. I know that to convert a fraction to a percentage, you multiply by 100. So 2/5 times 100. Wait, how do I do that math again? Maybe I can convert the fraction to a decimal first and then multiply by 100.

So 2 divided by 5. I think 5 goes into 2 zero times, so I add a decimal point. 5 into 20 is 4 because 5*4 is 20. So 2/5 is 0.4 as a decimal. Then, to make it a percentage, I multiply by 100, which moves the decimal two places right. So 0.4 becomes 40%. Okay, that makes sense.

Now the second part: 1/100 as a percentage. Hmm, that seems simpler. Because 1/100 is the same as 1%. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1/100 is 0.01 as a decimal, right? Because 1 divided by 100 is 0.01. Then, to get the percentage, you multiply by 100. So 0.01 times 100 is 1%. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, 1/100 is 1%, because the denominator is 100. Oh wait, maybe that's correct. So 1/100 is 1%. But wait, earlier I thought 0.01 times 100 is 1%, so yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thought. Because 1/100 is 0.01 in decimal, and then when you convert to percentage, you multiply by 100, which gives 1%. So yes, 1/100 is 1%.

Wait no, wait a second. Because I've heard that 1/100 is 1%, yes. So that must be right.

So putting it all together, 2/5 is 40%, and 1/100 is 1%. Now, looking at the options, which option has 40% and 1%?

Looking at the options:

Option A: 40%, 0.25% → No, because the second is 0.25, not 1.

Option B: 40%, 1% → Yes, that's what I got.

Option C: 35%, 0.75% → No.

Option D:50%,1% → No, first is 50.

Option E:40%,0.5% → No.

Option F:20%,0.5% → No.

Option G:20%,0.25% → No.

Option H:50%,0.5% → No.

Option I:30%,0.25% → No.

Option J:20%,1% → No.

So the correct answer should be option B. But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought 1/100 is 1%, but let me double-check.

Wait, 1 divided by 100 is 0.01. To get percentage, 0.01 *100 is 1%. Yep, correct. So the two answers are 40% and 1%, which is option B.
</think>

To determine the correct answer, we need to convert the fractions (2/5) and (1/100) into percentages.

1. **Converting (2/5) to a percentage:**
   - Divide 2 by 5: \( 2 \div 5 = 0.4 \).
   - Multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage: \( 0.4 \times 100 = 40\% \).

2. **Converting (1/100) to a percentage:**
   - Recognize that \( \frac{1}{100} \) is equivalent to 1% because the denominator is 100.

Thus, the percentages are 40% and 1%. Comparing this result with the provided options:

- **Option A:** 40%, 0.25% → Incorrect (second value is wrong).
- **Option B:** 40%, 1% → Correct (matches both values).
- **Option C:** 35%, 0.75% → Incorrect.
- **Option D:** 50%, 1% → Incorrect (first value is wrong).
- **Option E:** 40%, 0.5% → Incorrect (second value is wrong).
- **Option F:** 20%, 0.5% → Incorrect.
- **Option G:** 20%, 0.25% → Incorrect.
- **Option H:** 50%, 0.5% → Incorrect.
- **Option I:** 30%, 0.25% → Incorrect.
- **Option J:** 20%, 1% → Incorrect (first value is wrong).

The correct answer is **Option B: 40%, 1%**.
