Question:

Rainbow Corporation has outstanding 1,000 shares of voting common stock and 1,000 shares of nonvoting preferred. The preferred has a liquidation preference equal to its par value of $100 per share plus a 3 percent noncumulative dividend. Rainbow submits to its stockholders a proposal to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that would come ahead of the old preferred stock. At a shareholders' meeting, 700 common and 400 preferred vote in favor of the proposal. Which of the following statements is correct?

Options:

A: The proposal is invalidly approved because a unanimous vote from both classes is required.
B: The proposal is validly approved because the nonvoting preferred stock does not count towards the vote.
C: The proposal is invalidly approved because a two-thirds vote of each class is required.
D: The vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because it was nonvoting stock.
E: The proposal is validly approved because the common shareholders have the majority vote.
F: The vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because the proposal affects the common stock.
G: The proposal is validly approved because the preferred stockholders who voted in favor have a liquidation preference.
H: The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the outstanding shares did not approve.
I: The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.
J: The proposal is validly approved because overall a majority of the outstanding shares did approve.

Okay, so I've got this question here about corporate governance and voting on a proposal. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The company, Rainbow Corporation, has two types of shares: 1,000 shares of voting common stock and 1,000 shares of nonvoting preferred stock. The preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $100 per share plus a 3% noncumulative dividend. Now, they're proposing a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that come ahead of the old preferred. So, this new class would have higher priority in certain situations, like liquidation maybe.

They put this proposal to the stockholders. At the meeting, 700 common shareholders vote in favor, and 400 preferred shareholders do the same. I need to figure out if the proposal is validly approved or not, and why.

First, I should recall how stockholder voting works, especially when it comes to different classes of stock. I remember that in general, common stockholders have voting rights, typically one vote per share, and they elect the board of directors and vote on major corporate actions. Preferred stock usually doesn't have voting rights unless specified, like in certain circumstances.

In this case, the existing preferred stock is nonvoting. Wait, but the question says that 400 preferred shareholders voted. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. If the preferred is nonvoting, why did they vote? Or perhaps the question is implying that they were allowed to vote on this specific proposal?

Wait, the question states that the preferred stock is nonvoting, but the company submitted a proposal that affects the preferred stock. So sometimes, when a company proposes something that affects the rights of a particular class of stock, the holders of that class might get to vote on it, even if they usually don't have voting rights.

So I think that when a proposal affects the rights of a class of stock, like here creating a new preferred that has higher redemption rights, the existing preferred shareholders might have a vote. Because their rights are being altered. But wait, normally, nonvoting preferred doesn't vote unless their rights are being changed.

But the question says that the preferred is nonvoting. So I think that in general, they don't get to vote on regular matters, but for certain changes that affect their rights, they might have to approve it. So maybe in this case, the proposal to create a new class that affects their liquidation preference would require their consent.

Wait, but the question says the preferred stock is nonvoting. So perhaps they can't vote on this proposal at all. Or maybe they can because it's about their rights. I'm a bit confused here.

Another angle: The proposal is to authorize a new class of preferred stock. Under corporate law, when a company wants to issue a new class of stock that affects existing shareholders' rights, it usually requires the approval of the affected class. So if the new preferred comes ahead of the old in terms of redemption, then the existing preferred's rights are being changed. So they should have a say.

So in this case, the existing preferred might have the right to vote on this proposal, even if they're nonvoting otherwise. Because it's a change to their class rights.

So the proposal would need approval from both the common and the preferred shareholders, but perhaps each class votes separately.

Wait, how does that work? For changes that affect a particular class, sometimes that class has to approve the change by a certain percentage. In some cases, a two-thirds majority is required for amendments affecting class rights.

So the common stockholders would typically vote on their own, and the preferred would vote as a separate class. If the proposal affects the preferred's rights, then the preferred shareholders would need to approve it, perhaps by a majority or a higher threshold.

Looking at the votes: 700 common in favor, 400 preferred in favor. So total shares: 1,000 common, 1,000 preferred. So 700/1000 is 70% of common in favor. 400/1000 is 40% of preferred in favor.

Now, the question is, what's the required vote here? If the proposal affects the preferred's rights, then each class might need to approve it by a majority, or maybe a higher threshold.

Wait, the options mention things like two-thirds. Option C says it's invalid because a two-thirds of each class is required. So if each class needs to approve by two-thirds, then 700 is more than two-thirds of 1000 (which would be 666.67), so common is okay. But preferred only got 400, which is 40%, less than two-thirds. So if a two-thirds vote per class is needed, then it's not approved, making the proposal invalid.

But wait, maybe not. Let me think about when a class vote is required. Typically, when a company wants to amend the rights of a particular class of stock, that class must approve the amendment. The required vote can vary by jurisdiction or the company's charter. But commonly, it's a majority of that class.

Wait, but in some cases, like when creating a new class that's senior in rank, it's considered to adversely affect the existing preferred. So the existing preferred's approval might be needed, perhaps by a majority. But I'm not sure if it's a simple majority or something else.

Wait, let's get back to the question. The proposal is to create a new class of preferred with redemption rights that come ahead of the old preferred. So the new class would have higher priority, which could dilute the old preferred's rights. So the old preferred's holders might need to approve this change.

If the preferred stock is nonvoting, but they're allowed to vote on this particular matter because it affects their rights, then their vote would count. So the question is, what's the required percentage.

In the options, option I says the proposal is invalid because a majority of the preferred didn't approve. Since 400 is less than 500 (majority of 1000), that would mean the preferred didn't approve. If their approval is needed, then the proposal fails.

Alternatively, if the company's charter requires a higher threshold, like two-thirds, then 400 is less than the required 666, so option C would apply.

But I'm not exactly sure about the default rules. In many jurisdictions, when amending the rights of a class, the approval of that class is required, typically by a majority (unless the charter specifies otherwise). So if the preferred's rights are being changed, their majority vote would be needed.

In this case, the preferred only got 40% in favor. So the proposal didn't get a majority from the preferred. Thus, it's invalid because the preferred didn't approve it.

Wait, but option I says "invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve." So if a majority is needed, then yes, 400 is less than 500, so the preferred didn't approve. Thus, the proposal is invalid.

But wait another point: The question states that the preferred is nonvoting. So maybe they don't have the right to vote on this proposal at all. But earlier reasoning suggested that when their rights are affected, they do get to vote. So perhaps the fact that they typically don't vote doesn't matter here because the proposal affects their rights.

Alternatively, maybe nonvoting preferred can't vote even on matters affecting their rights. But that doesn't seem right because changes to their rights should require their consent.

So putting it together, the proposal affects the preferred's rights, so they need to approve it, perhaps by a majority. Since 400 out of 1000 is 40%, less than a majority, the proposal didn't get their approval. Therefore, it's invalidly approved.

Looking at the options, option I says that. So the correct answer would be I.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option C says it's invalid because two-thirds of each class is required. So if the required vote was two-thirds, then the common got 70% which is over, but the preferred only 40% which is under. So the proposal would fail. But I'm not sure if two-thirds is the required threshold here.

In general, for amending the certificate of incorporation regarding class rights, the typical requirement is a majority vote of that class. So unless the corporation's charter requires a supermajority, it's a majority.

So in that case, the preferred's approval wasn't obtained (only 40%), so the proposal is invalid. So option I is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The proposal is to authorize a new class of preferred stock. So the common shareholders would typically have the authority to approve that, as they're the ones who usually vote on such amendments. But if this new class affects the existing preferred's rights, then perhaps the preferred must also approve it.

So the proposal needs both the common's approval and the preferred's approval. Common approved (70%), which is a majority, but preferred did not (40%). So overall, the proposal isn't approved because the preferred didn't give their consent.

Therefore, the correct answer would be I: The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.

But wait, another thought: Do the nonvoting preferred shareholders have the right to vote on this matter? Normally, nonvoting stock doesn't vote, unless the matter is of the type that gives them voting rights, like changes to their rights.

In this case, the proposal is about creating a new class that comes ahead in redemption, which affects the old preferred's rights. So perhaps the nonvoting preferred do get to vote on this particular issue.

So the answer hinges on whether the nonvoting preferred can vote on this proposal. If they can, and their majority is needed, and they didn't approve, then the proposal fails.

Alternatively, if nonvoting preferred can't vote even on their own rights changes, then their vote doesn't matter, and only the common's approval is needed. But that doesn't make much sense because changes to their rights should require their consent.

But the question says they did vote, with 400 in favor. So perhaps the scenario is that the preferred were allowed to vote on this matter despite being nonvoting generally.

So, in that case, their approval is needed, and since they didn't approve by a majority, the proposal is invalid. So option I is correct.

The question revolves around whether a proposal by Rainbow Corporation to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that come ahead of the existing preferred stock is validly approved. The company has 1,000 shares of voting common stock and 1,000 shares of nonvoting preferred stock. The proposal received 700 votes in favor from common shareholders and 400 votes in favor from preferred shareholders. The key issue is whether the proposal is validly approved, given the voting requirements and the rights of the preferred shareholders.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Voting Rights of Nonvoting Preferred Stock**: Typically, nonvoting preferred stock does not have the right to vote on general corporate matters. However, when a proposal affects the rights of the preferred stockholders (e.g., by creating a new class of preferred stock with superior redemption rights), the existing preferred stockholders may be granted voting rights on that specific proposal.

2. **Impact of the Proposal**: The new class of preferred stock would have redemption rights that come ahead of the existing preferred stock, effectively altering the rights of the current preferred stockholders. This suggests that the proposal directly affects their interests, and their approval may be required.

3. **Voting Requirements**: When a proposal affects the rights of a class of stock, that class often must approve the proposal. The required threshold for approval typically depends on the company’s charter or applicable law. If the preferred stockholders are allowed to vote on this proposal, their approval may be required by a majority (or potentially a higher threshold, such as two-thirds).

4. **Vote Results**:
   - Common shareholders: 700 out of 1,000 voted in favor (70% approval).
   - Preferred shareholders: 400 out of 1,000 voted in favor (40% approval).

   If a majority vote of the preferred shareholders is required, the proposal would fail because only 40% of the preferred shareholders approved it. Similarly, if a two-thirds vote of the preferred shareholders is required, the proposal would also fail.

5. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. Unanimous approval is not typically required for such proposals.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The nonvoting preferred stock may still have the right to vote on matters affecting their rights.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. While a two-thirds vote of each class may be required in some cases, the question does not specify that this is the threshold.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The vote of the preferred stockholders does matter if their rights are affected.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. While the common shareholders approved the proposal, the preferred shareholders’ rights may also need to be considered.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The proposal affects the preferred stockholders’ rights, so their vote is relevant.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The liquidation preference of the preferred stockholders does not directly determine the validity of the proposal.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The overall majority of outstanding shares is not the determining factor if the proposal requires class-specific approval.
   - **Option I**: Correct. The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve it.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. Overall majority approval is not sufficient if the proposal requires approval from the preferred shareholders.

### Conclusion:
The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve it. This makes **Option I** the correct answer.
