Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about mole fractions of solute and solvent. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I can figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about preparing a solution by dissolving 98 grams of H2SO4 in 162 grams of H2O. I need to find the mole fractions of each. The options are from A to J, each giving different mole fractions. 

Okay, first things first, I remember that mole fraction is the moles of a component divided by the total moles in the solution. So I need to find the moles of H2SO4 and H2O, then compute their mole fractions.

Wait, the molecular weights are given: H2SO4 is 98 g/mol and H2O is 18 g/mol. Right, so I can calculate the moles by dividing the mass by the molar mass.

Let me calculate the moles of H2SO4. So 98 grams divided by 98 g/mol. Oh, that's easy—98/98 is 1 mole. So n(H2SO4)=1.

Now for the H2O: 162 grams divided by 18 g/mol. Let's see, 162 divided by 18... 18 times 9 is 162, so that's 9 moles. So n(H2O)=9.

Wait, but wait a second—wait, wait. Because when H2SO4 dissolves in water, does it dissociate? Hmm, I think for mole fraction calculations, we treat the solute as a single component unless it dissociates into ions. But wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid and it dissociates completely in water. Oh, right, but wait, in solution, H2SO4 dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2- ions. So would that affect the mole fractions? Or does mole fraction consider the formula units before dissociation?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Mole fraction is based on the amount of substance, considering each molecule as a unit. So if the solute dissociates, the number of particles increases, but mole fraction is calculated based on the formula before dissociation. Wait no, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, mole fraction is the moles of each component (as they are in solution) divided by total moles. So if H2SO4 dissociates completely into H+ and SO4^2-, then each H2SO4 gives two particles. So would that affect the mole fractions?

Wait, no, wait. No, mole fraction is calculated based on the actual species present. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because I'm pretty sure when calculating mole fractions, you consider the solute as the formula unit before dissociation. Because otherwise, the mole fractions would change based on the extent of dissociation, which complicates things. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, but let me think again.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because in a solution, the solute might dissociate, but mole fraction is based on the actual particles present. So for example, if H2SO4 dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-, then each mole of H2SO4 becomes 2 moles of ions. So that would mean the moles of solute particles increase. But wait, the question says the solute is H2SO4. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, but wait a minute, the problem doesn't specify whether to consider the ions or not. Hmm. In most cases, mole fraction problems treat the solute as the formula unit without considering dissociation. So perhaps I should proceed with that assumption, treating H2SO4 as a single component.

Therefore, H2SO4 is 1 mole, and H2O is 9 moles. So the total moles would be 1 + 9 =10 moles.

So mole fraction of H2SO4 is 1/(1+9) = 1/10 = 0.1. Mole fraction of H2O is 9/10 = 0.9.

So looking at the options, that's option A: mole fraction H2SO4 is 0.1, H2O is 0.9.

Wait, but wait a second—could the fact that H2SO4 is a strong acid and dissociates completely affect this calculation? Because if each H2SO4 molecule becomes two ions, then the total moles in solution would be 1 (from H2SO4) * 2 (ions) plus 9 (H2O) = 2 +9=11 moles? But then H2SO4's mole fraction would be 2/11, which is approximately 0.18, and H2O's would be 9/11, about 0.82. But that's not one of the options. Hmm, none of the options match that. So perhaps the problem expects us not to consider dissociation. Because otherwise, the answer wouldn't be among the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats the solute as the entire H2SO4 molecule without considering dissociation. Because in the options, option A matches if we don't consider dissociation.

So, given that, I think the correct approach here is to calculate based on the formula units, not the ions. So the initial calculation of mole fractions being 0.1 and 0.9, which is option A.

To determine the mole fractions of H₂SO₄ (solute) and H₂O (solvent) in the solution, the following steps are taken:

1. **Calculate the moles of H₂SO₄**:  
   The mass of H₂SO₄ is 98 g, and its molar mass is 98 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₂SO₄} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{98}{98} = 1 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the moles of H₂O**:  
   The mass of H₂O is 162 g, and its molar mass is 18 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H₂O} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{162}{18} = 9 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Calculate the total moles in the solution**:  
   \[
   \text{Total Moles} = \text{Moles of H₂SO₄} + \text{Moles of H₂O} = 1 + 9 = 10 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the mole fractions**:  
   - Mole fraction of H₂SO₄:  
     \[
     X_{\text{H₂SO₄}} = \frac{\text{Moles of H₂SO₄}}{\text{Total Moles}} = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1.
     \]
   - Mole fraction of H₂O:  
     \[
     X_{\text{H₂O}} = \frac{\text{Moles of H₂O}}{\text{Total Moles}} = \frac{9}{10} = 0.9.
     \]

5. **Interpretation of dissociation**:  
   Although H₂SO₄ dissociates completely into H⁺ and SO₄²⁻ ions in water, the problem does not explicitly require considering dissociation. Therefore, the mole fractions are calculated based on the formula units of H₂SO₄ and H₂O as given.

6. **Final Answer**:  
   The mole fractions are \( X_{\text{H₂SO₄}} = 0.1 \) and \( X_{\text{H₂O}} = 0.9 \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
