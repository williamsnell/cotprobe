Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about boiling point elevation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the boiling point of a solution made by dissolving 234 grams of NaCl in 500 grams of water. I remember that when you dissolve a solute in a solvent, the boiling point increases. This is called boiling point elevation. The formula for calculating the change in boiling point is ΔTb = Kb * m, where Kb is the boiling point elevation constant and m is the molality of the solution.

Wait, right, molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. So I need to find the molality first. Let's break it down.

First, I need to find the moles of NaCl. The molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol (Na is about 23, Cl is about 35.45, so 23 + 35.45 equals 58.45, I think). So moles of NaCl would be mass divided by molar mass. The mass given is 234 grams. 

Calculating that: 234 g / 58.44 g/mol. Let me do the math. 234 divided by 58.44. Hmm, 58.44 times 4 is 233.76, which is almost 234. So that would be approximately 4 moles. Wait that can't be right because 4 times 58.44 is 233.76, which is just a bit less than 234. So maybe it's like 3.999 moles, which is roughly 4.0 moles. Okay, so approximately 4 moles of NaCl.

Wait, but wait, NaCl dissociates in water into two ions: Na+ and Cl-. So each formula unit gives two particles. But wait, for boiling point elevation, does the van't Hoff factor come into play? Oh right, because the formula accounts for the number of particles. So the molality would effectively double because each NaCl gives two ions. So the molality used for ΔTb would be 2 times the molality of NaCl.

Wait, let me get that straight. The van't Hoff factor (i) is 2 for NaCl because it dissociates into two ions. So when calculating the boiling point elevation, I have to consider that each mole of NaCl contributes two moles of particles. So the molality for the solution's effect on boiling point is 2 * (moles of NaCl) / kg of solvent.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Molality (m) is moles of solute divided by kg of solvent. But since each mole of NaCl gives two moles of particles, the effective molality for boiling point purposes is 2m. So when calculating ΔTb, it's Kb multiplied by that effective molality.

So first, let's compute the molality of NaCl. Moles of NaCl is 234 g / 58.44 g/mol ≈ 4.0 moles. The mass of the solvent (water) is 500 grams, which is 0.5 kg. So molality m = 4.0 / 0.5 = 8.0 m.

But since NaCl dissociates into two ions, the effective molality is 2 * 8.0 = 16.0 m.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The molality of the solution in terms of particles is i times the molality of the solute. So m_effective = i * m. So m is 8.0, i is 2, so m_effective is 16.0.

Now, I need the Kb value for water. I remember that Kb for water is 0.512 °C·kg/mol. So that's the boiling point elevation constant. So ΔTb = Kb * m_effective = 0.512 * 16.0.

Calculating that: 0.512 * 16. Let's see, 0.5 *16 is 8, and 0.012*16 is 0.192, so total is 8.192 °C. So the boiling point increases by approximately 8.192 degrees.

Wait, but wait. The standard boiling point of pure water is 100°C at standard pressure. So the new boiling point would be 100 + 8.192 = 108.192°C. Rounding that, it would be approximately 108.2°C.

Looking at the options, option H is 108.32°C. That's pretty close. But wait, maybe my approximations are off. Let me recalculate more accurately.

Let me redo the calculations without approximations.

First, the exact moles of NaCl. The exact molar mass of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol. So 234 g /58.44 g/mol equals approximately what?

Let me compute 58.44 times 4 is 233.76. So 234 -233.76 is 0.24 grams. So that's 4 + 0.24/58.44. 0.24 /58.44 is approximately 0.0041. So moles of NaCl is about 4.0041 mol.

Molality m = moles / kg of solvent. So 4.0041 / 0.5 kg = 8.0082 m.

Since i=2, the effective molality is 16.0164 m.

Now ΔTb = Kb * m_eff = 0.512 * 16.0164. Let's calculate that.

0.512 * 16 is 8.192.

But 0.512 * 0.0164 = approximately 0.0084288.

So total ΔTb is approximately 8.192 + 0.0084288 ≈ 8.2004 °C.

Adding that to 100°C gives 108.2004°C, which is approximately 108.2°C.

Looking back at the options:

Option H is 108.32°C.

Hmm, that's a bit higher than my calculated 108.2. Why the discrepancy? Maybe because I approximated the moles or the Kb value.

Wait, let me double-check the Kb value. The Kb for water is 0.512 °C·kg/mol. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of NaCl. Let me calculate 234 divided by 58.44 more accurately.

58.44 × 4 = 233.76 → 234 -233.76=0.24 grams.

0.24 g /58.44 g/mol = 0.24 /58.44 = approximately 0.004106 mol.

So total moles of NaCl is 4.0041 mol.

Molality m = 4.0041 /0.5 =8.0082 m.

Effective m = 2 ×8.0082=16.0164 m.

ΔTb=0.512 ×16.0164.

Let me compute 0.512 ×16 =8.192.

0.512 ×0.0164=0.0084288.

Total ΔTb=8.192 +0.0084288=8.2004°C.

So Tboil=100 +8.2004=108.2004°C.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H:108.32°C, but my calculation gives about 108.2. So why is there a difference? Maybe I used an approximate Kb value.

Wait, perhaps the exact Kb for water is 0.512 °C·kg/mol. So that's correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to round the moles to 4, making m=8.0, so ΔTb=0.512 ×16=8.192, giving 108.192°C. So, 108.2°C, which isn't exactly an option. The options are A:102.5, B:100, C:109.5, D:106.78, E:101.22, F:112.45, G:115, H:108.32, I:105, J:110.

So 108.2 is closest to H (108.32) and perhaps another option. Wait, what about more precise calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately. Let me do 0.512 ×16.0164.

Let me compute 16 ×0.512 =8.192.

Then 0.0164 ×0.512 = ?

0.01 ×0.512=0.00512.

0.0064 ×0.512=0.0032768.

So 0.00512 +0.0032768=0.0083968.

So total ΔTb=8.192 +0.0083968=8.2003968 °C.

So 100 +8.2004 is 108.2004°C, approximately 108.2°C.

But the option H is 108.32°C, which is a tenth higher. So perhaps my approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the van't Hoff factor. Wait, in the case of NaCl, the van't Hoff factor is indeed 2 because it dissociates into two ions. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting me not to consider that, but that wouldn't make sense. Boiling point elevation depends on the number of particles.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is using a different Kb value. For example, sometimes Kb is taken as 0.51 instead of 0.512. Let me try with 0.51.

So ΔTb =0.51 *16.0164.

0.5 ×16=8, 0.01×16=0.16, 0.001 ×16=0.016. So 0.51 is 0.5+0.01, so 8 +0.16=8.16, plus 0.0164 ×0.51?

Wait, maybe I should compute 0.51 ×16.0164.

Compute 16 ×0.51 =8.16.

0.0164 ×0.51: 0.01 ×0.51=0.0051, 0.0064 ×0.51=0.003264. So total 0.0051 +0.003264=0.008364.

So 8.16 +0.008364=8.168364.

So ΔTb=8.1684°C.

Then boiling point is 100 +8.1684=108.1684°C, which is about 108.17°C. Still not matching any option exactly.

Hmm, the options don't have 108.2, but H is 108.32. Which is about 0.12 higher than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of NaCl. Let me compute 234 /58.44 more accurately.

58.44 *4=233.76.

234-233.76=0.24 g.

So 0.24 g /58.44 g/mol =0.24 /58.44.

Let me compute this exactly: 0.24 divided by 58.44.

58.44 goes into 0.24 how many times? Let's see: 58.44 ×0.004=0.23376. So 0.23376 is less than 0.24. The difference is 0.24 -0.23376=0.00624.

So 0.00624 /58.44 ≈0.0001068. So total moles is 4.0041068.

So m=4.0041 /0.5=8.008216 mol/kg.

m_eff=2 ×8.008216=16.016432.

ΔTb=0.512 ×16.016432.

Compute 16 ×0.512=8.192.

0.016432 ×0.512=?

0.01 ×0.512=0.00512

0.006432 ×0.512= let's calculate: 0.006 ×0.512=0.003072, 0.000432 ×0.512=0.000221184.

So 0.003072 +0.000221184=0.003293184.

So 0.00512 +0.003293184=0.008413184.

So total ΔTb=8.192 +0.008413184=8.200413184.

So about 8.2004°C. Thus, Tboil=108.2004°C, which is approximately 108.2°C.

Looking again at the options: H is 108.32, which is 0.12 higher than 108.2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the Kb value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me not to consider the van't Hoff factor.

Wait, if I don't consider the van't Hoff factor, then m_eff would be 8.0082, and ΔTb =0.512 ×8.0082=?

0.512 ×8=4.096.

0.512 ×0.0082= approx 0.0041984.

So total ΔTb=4.1001984.

So Tboil=100 +4.10=104.10°C. But that's not any of the options either. Wait, but that's not matching because the options don't have 104.1. So that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, like considering the solution's concentration in terms of mass percent or something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps calculate using the formula that includes the molality correctly.

Wait, but I think my initial approach is correct: considering the van't Hoff factor. So why is the option H 108.32, which is a bit higher?

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a Kb of 0.513 instead of 0.512. Let me try that.

ΔTb=0.513 *16.0164.

Compute 16 *0.513=8.208.

0.0164 *0.513=approx 0.0084152.

Total ΔTb=8.208 +0.0084152=8.2164152.

So Tboil=100 +8.2164=108.2164, which is about 108.22°C. That's still a little lower than 108.32.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a Kb of 0.515. Let me try that.

0.515 ×16.0164= ?

16 ×0.515=8.24.

0.0164 ×0.515=approx 0.008446.

Total=8.24+0.008446=8.248446.

So Tboil=100+8.248=108.248°C. Hmm, still lower than 108.32.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different value for the molar mass of NaCl. Let me check.

The exact molar mass of NaCl is 22.99 (Na) +35.45 (Cl)=58.44 g/mol. So that part is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the formula without considering that NaCl dissociates, but that would be incorrect because boiling point elevation depends on the number of particles.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the solution's concentration in terms of molarity instead of molality.

Wait, but boiling point elevation uses molality, not molarity. Because molality is based on mass, which doesn't change with temperature.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of moles.

Wait, let me recompute 234 /58.44.

So 58.44 *4=233.76.

234-233.76=0.24 grams.

So moles=4 + (0.24/58.44)=4 + 0.004106=4.004106 mol.

So that part seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the solvent's mass is 500 g, which is 0.5 kg, correct.

Wait, maybe I should try an alternative approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for boiling point elevation with the solution's molality as (moles of NaCl ×i) divided by kg of solvent.

Which is what I did. So I think my calculation is correct, and the closest option is H at 108.32°C, but my calculation is 108.20. Hmm.

Looking at the options, there's another option: option C is 109.5, which is higher. Option J is 110, which is even higher. So none of them is exactly matching 108.2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Kb. Alternatively, perhaps the Kb used here is 0.52 instead of 0.512.

Let me try Kb=0.52.

ΔTb=0.52 *16.0164.

16 *0.52=8.32.

0.0164 *0.52=0.008528.

So ΔTb=8.32+0.008528=8.3285.

So Tboil=100 +8.3285=108.3285, which is approximately 108.33°C. That's very close to option H, which is 108.32°C.

Ah, so if the Kb used is 0.52 instead of 0.512, then the answer would be approximately 108.33°C, which matches option H.

So perhaps the question uses a rounded Kb value of 0.52 instead of the more precise 0.512.

So under that assumption, the correct answer would be H:108.32°C.
</think>

To determine the boiling point of a solution prepared by dissolving 234 g of NaCl in 500 g of water, we use the concept of boiling point elevation. The formula for boiling point elevation is:

\[
\Delta T_b = K_b \cdot m_{\text{effective}}
\]

Where:
- \( \Delta T_b \) is the change in boiling point.
- \( K_b \) is the boiling point elevation constant for water, approximately \( 0.512 \, ^\circ\text{C} \cdot \text{kg/mol} \).
- \( m_{\text{effective}} \) is the effective molality of the solution, which accounts for the dissociation of NaCl into two ions (Na\(^+\) and Cl\(^-\)).

### Step 1: Calculate the moles of NaCl
The molar mass of NaCl is \( 58.44 \, \text{g/mol} \). The number of moles of NaCl is:

\[
\text{Moles of NaCl} = \frac{\text{Mass of NaCl}}{\text{Molar Mass of NaCl}} = \frac{234}{58.44} \approx 4.0041 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the molality of NaCl
Molality (\( m \))
