Okay, so I have this problem about a diffraction grating and resolving a sodium doublet. Hmm, I remember that diffraction gratings are used to split light into its colors, and the number of lines on the grating affects the resolution. The sodium doublet has two wavelengths, 589.0 nm and 589.6 nm. The question is about finding the minimum number of grating lines needed to resolve these two lines when the grating is blazed for the second order.

Wait, I think the key here is to use the Rayleigh criterion for resolution. Rayleigh said that two adjacent wavelengths can just be resolved when the angle of the first minimum of one coincides with the angle of the maximum of the other. But wait, or is it when the maxima are separated by at least the width of one of the minima? I might be confusing that part.

Alternatively, the formula for the resolving power of a grating is R = m*N, where m is the order and N is the number of lines. Oh right, resolving power is the ability to distinguish two close wavelengths. So R = λ/Δλ. So the resolving power needed here should be at least the ratio of the wavelength to the difference between them.

Wait, the two wavelengths are 589.0 and 589.6 nm. So Δλ is 0.6 nm. So λ is about 589 nm. So R should be λ/Δλ = 589 / 0.6. Let me calculate that. 589 divided by 0.6 is approximately 982.333... So R ≈ 983.

Since R = m*N, and m is the order. The problem says the grating is blazed for the second order, so m=2. So N would need to be at least R/m. So N = R/m ≈ 983 / 2 ≈ 491.5.

But wait, the grating must have at least this many lines. So we need to round up to the next whole number. So 492 lines. But looking at the options, option J is 491, which is just below. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check. The wavelengths are 589.0 and 589.6 nm. So the difference is 0.6 nm. So Δλ = 0.6. Then λ is approximately 589.3 nm (average of the two?), but for the resolving power, it's λ/Δλ, so 589.3/0.6 is about 982.17. So R is about 982.17.

So R = m*N → N = R/m = 982.17 / 2 ≈ 491.085. So N needs to be at least 492, but the closest option is 491 (option J). Wait, why is the answer not 492? Because maybe the numbers are approximated. Or perhaps I'm missing something about the blaze angle.

Wait, the grating is blazed for the second order, which affects the efficiency, but does it affect the number of lines required for resolution? Blaze angle is about where the maximum efficiency is, but for resolving power calculations, it's about N and m. So maybe my previous approach is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but I need to reevaluate. Let's see the options again. The options are A:560, B:520, C:500, D:600, E:470, F:450, G:480, H:510, I:430, J:491.

Wait, 491 is option J. So according to my calculation, I need about 491.085 lines, so the minimum number of lines is 492, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question expects us to round down, but that doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction. Or maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula isn't R = m*N. I think I confused Rayleigh's criterion with the resolving power equation. Let me clarify.

The resolving power of a grating is given by R = m*N. So R is the product of the order and the number of lines. To resolve two wavelengths, the condition is that R must be greater than or equal to λ/Δλ.

So let me redo the calculation. λ is the average of 589.0 and 589.6, which is 589.3 nm. Δλ is 0.6 nm. So λ/Δλ = 589.3 / 0.6 ≈ 982.17.

So R = m*N needs to be at least 982.17. Since m is 2, N must be at least 982.17 / 2 = 491.085. So N must be at least 492 lines. But none of the options is 492. The closest is J:491.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using the minimum R, so maybe exact calculation is needed. Let me compute more precisely.

λ₁ = 589.0 nm, λ₂ =589.6 nm → Δλ = 0.6 nm.

So λ/Δλ = 589.3 / 0.6 = 982.1666...

So R = m*N → N = R/(m). So N = 982.1666... /2 = 491.083333.

So N must be greater than 491.0833. So the next integer is 492. But the options don't have 492. So perhaps the intended answer is 491, but that would give R=m*N=2*491=982, which is just below the required 982.17. So maybe the correct answer is 491 isn't sufficient, and we need 492. But in the options, J is 491, which is just below.

Wait, but maybe the calculation is done using the highest order? Or perhaps I should think about the angular resolution.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula based on the angle. The grating equation is d sin θ = m λ. The resolving condition is that the separation in wavelengths is such that the angle between the two maxima is at least the width of the diffraction peak.

The Rayleigh condition is that the secondary maximum of one overlaps with the principal maximum of the other. The angular separation between the two maxima should be at least the width of the central maximum.

The angular width of the central maximum is 2θ, where θ is given by sinθ = λ/(2d) [from the first minimum condition: d sinθ = (m+1/2)λ, but wait, for the first minimum, it's (m + 0.5)λ = d sin θ → θ = arcsin( (m + 0.5)λ/d ).

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. The formula for the resolving power is R = m*N = (λ/Δλ) ≥ (λ)/(Δλ). So I think the initial approach is correct.

But perhaps the actual calculation of Δλ is λ₂ - λ₁ = 589.6 -589.0 =0.6 nm. So λ/Δλ =589.3/0.6≈982.1666...

So R needs to be at least 982.1666. Since R = m*N → N=982.1666/2=491.0833.

So since N must be an integer, N must be at least 492. But no option is 492, so perhaps the closest is 491, but that would give R=982, which is just below the needed 982.17. So perhaps the correct answer is the next integer above, but the options don't have that.

Wait, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 589.3/0.6 again. 589.3 divided by 0.6 is 589.3 ÷ 0.6. Let me compute this correctly.

0.6 * 982 = 589.2, so 0.6 * 982.1666 is 589.3. So yes, 982.1666.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is 491, but since 491*2=982, which is less than 982.17, it's insufficient. So perhaps the correct minimum N is 492, but since it's not an option, maybe the question is considering something else.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should use the highest possible m? No, the grating is blazed for m=2, so we use m=2.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of lines is per inch or per meter? No, the problem doesn't specify any units, so I think the initial approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact resolving power needed. Let's see, the formula for resolving power when considering the diffraction grating is R = (m*(N)) = (λ_avg / Δλ).

Wait, but maybe the correct formula is R = m*N = (d sinθ)/ (Δλ) ), but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the formula for the resolving power is R = m*N, so m is the order, N the number of lines. So to resolve two wavelengths, the condition is that m*N ≥ λ_avg / Δλ.

So in this case, m=2, so N must be at least (λ_avg / Δλ)/m.

So (589.3 nm / 0.6 nm) = 982.1666, divided by 2 gives N=491.0833.

So N must be at least 492. But since the options don't include 492, perhaps I have to check the options again.

Wait the options are:

A:560

B:520

C:500

D:600

E:470

F:450

G:480

H:510

I:430

J:491

So the closest is option J:491. But according to the calculation, 491 lines provide R=2*491=982, which is less than 982.17, meaning the doublet wouldn't be resolved. So perhaps the correct answer is the next integer, but it's not present. Maybe the question expects us to round down, which would suggest option J:491 is the answer, but that might not be sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing λ. Let me double-check the exact values. The sodium doublet is at 589 nm (approximately the D lines at 589.0 and 589.6). So λ1 = 589.0, λ2 =589.6. So Δλ is 0.6 nm. The average λ is (589.0 +589.6)/2 = 589.3 nm.

So R = 589.3 / 0.6 = 982.166... So R must be >=982.166. So R = m*N=2*N >=982.166 → N >=491.083. So N must be at least 492.

But the options don't have 492, so perhaps the intended answer is 491 (J). But that would give R=982, which is just below the needed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the approximation that R = m*N ≥ λ/Δλ. So if R is 2*N, then N = R /2. So perhaps the exact calculation is:

N = (λ/Δλ) / m.

Wait, let me compute it again:

λ =589.0 and 589.6 → average is 589.3, Δλ=0.6.

So R =589.3 /0.6 =982.166.

N= R / m =982.166 / 2=491.083.

Since N must be integer, N=492. But it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is 491, but that would not meet the requirement. So perhaps the question made a miscalculation, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the calculation uses λ =589.3 nm, and the difference is 0.6. So λ/Δλ = 589.3 / 0.6 =982.166.

But perhaps the question is using the maximum possible R for N lines, which would be R = m*N. So to get R >=982.166, with m=2, N must be at least 492. So why isn't that an option?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula in terms of the highest order. No, the grating is blazed for second order, so m=2 is the optimal. So I think the correct calculation is N=492, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the closest option above 491.083, which would be 491. But if 491 is the option, then perhaps the intended answer is J:491. But that doesn't meet the required R. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the resolving power to be just R= m*N, and perhaps the answer is the next integer above, but since that's not present, maybe the intended answer is option J.

Hmm, perhaps the intended approach is to compute N = (λ/(Δλ)) / m, and round to the nearest integer. So 491.08 would round to 491, but that's still insufficient. So perhaps the correct answer is 491, but that's just barely under. 

Alternatively, maybe the question uses the maximum wavelength in the doublet, so 589.6 nm, and compute R as 589.6 /0.6 = 986. So R=986, then N=986/2=493. Still, 493 isn't an option.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is considering the separation in the first order? No, the grating is blazed for the second order, so that's where the maximum efficiency is, so m=2 is used.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of lines per mm or inch, but I don't think so because the problem doesn't mention it.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula used is R = N*m, which is the same as before. So I think the correct approach is N must be at least 492, but since that's not an option, the intended answer must be J:491.

Wait another angle: Maybe the question is referring to the minimum number of lines required to just resolve, so perhaps exactly at the limit. So N=491.0833 would be the limit, so 491 lines would just barely not make it, and 492 would. But since 492 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is 491, but that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula R = m*N = (λ)/(Δλ) → so N = (λ)/(m Δλ). Let's compute that.

λ is 589.0 nm and 589.6 nm. So perhaps the average is 589.3 nm, as before.

So N = (589.3) / (2 * 0.6) → 589.3/(1.2)=492.4166. So N=493? Again, no option for that.

Alternatively, perhaps using the maximum of the two, 589.6, so N=589.6/(2*0.6) → 589.6/(1.2)=492.666... So again, N=493.

But in the options, the closest is J:491. So perhaps the intended answer is J:491.

Wait, but in that case, perhaps the problem expects us to use the lower wavelength, 589.0, so N=589/(2*0.6)=589/1.2=492.5, which would round to 493. But again, not present.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to pick the closest option, which is J:491, but that's just under. Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the calculation another way.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the angular resolution: θ = arcsin(m λ / d). The resolving power is R = m N, so R = (λ/Δλ).

Wait, another formula: The number of lines per meter is given by another approach, but I think I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option J:491. But I'm not entirely confident because 491 lines give R=982, which is less than 982.17. So perhaps the question intended to use R= m*N ≥ (λ/Δλ), but since 491 is the closest, that's the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recalculate:

Δλ = 589.6 -589.0 = 0.6 nm.

λ_avg = (589.0 +589.6)/2 = 589.3 nm.

R = λ_avg / Δλ = 589.3 /0.6 = 982.166...

R = m*N → N = R/m =982.166 /2 =491.0833.

So N must be at least 492. Since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is J:491, but that's not sufficient. So perhaps the correct answer isn't present, but the closest is J.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses R = (λ₂ - λ₁) / (m N) ≤ 1, so 0.6/(2*N) ≤ 1 → N ≥ 0.3, but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. The resolving condition is that the overlap of the maxima and minima occurs, so the formula is R = m N ≥ λ/Δλ.

So in that case, the calculation is correct, and the required N is 492, but it's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is J:491, but that doesn't meet the requirement. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the maximum possible N from the options. Let me compute R for each option when m=2.

Option J:491 → R=2*491=982.

Which is just below the required 982.17. So 982 < 982.17 → insufficient. So the doublet wouldn't be resolved.

The next higher option is H:510 → R=2*510=1020, which is sufficient.

But that's much higher than needed. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is the next option above, which isn't present here. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps the intended is J:491.

Wait, but the question says "at least how many lines must the grating have". So we need the minimum N where R >=982.17. So N must be 492, but it's not an option. So perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the sodium lines are 589.3 and 589.9, making Δλ=0.6, but that doesn't change the calculation. Or perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Another approach: The formula for the resolving power of a grating in a spectrometer is R = m N = (d/dθ) (sinθ2 - sinθ1), but that's getting into calculus. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation R = m N.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the angle between the two wavelengths. The condition
