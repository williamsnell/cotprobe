Okay, so I'm trying to solve this commutator machine problem. Hmm, let's see what the question is about. It's a 4-pole machine with 124 lap coils, each having two turns. The flux per pole is 0.015 weber. I need to calculate two things: part (a) is the DC voltage across quadrature brushes, and part (b) is the RMS voltage for three-phase working with some specific conditions.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, so I'll need to think step by step. Let me start with part (a).

First, I remember that in a DC machine, the generated voltage (EMF) can be calculated using the formula E = (PφNZ)/(60A), where P is the number of poles, φ is the flux per pole, N is the speed in rpm, Z is the number of armature conductors, and A is the number of parallel paths.

Wait, but wait—this is a commutator machine, so it's probably a DC machine. Oh, right, the question mentions quadrature brushes, which makes sense in a DC machine with commutators. So part (a) is about the DC voltage.

But wait, the problem doesn't give the speed. Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh no, part (b) gives the speed as 1400 rev/min. But part (a) doesn't mention speed. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, maybe the speed is given in part (b), but part (a) perhaps assumes some standard condition? Wait, no, that's confusing. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says for part (b), the relative field/conductor speed is 1400 rev/min. Hmm, maybe that's the speed for part (b). So for part (a), perhaps I'm missing the speed, or maybe the speed is related to another parameter. Alternatively, perhaps the speed is given in part (a) implicitly elsewhere. Wait, no, the problem as stated only gives the speed in part (b). So maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-read.

Wait, no, in the question, the speed (1400 rev/min) is given for part (b). So perhaps part (a) doesn't require the speed? That doesn't make sense because the generated voltage depends on speed. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps part (a) is about the induced voltage without considering the speed, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the speed is given elsewhere. Oh wait, perhaps the 124 lap coils and 4 poles imply something about the speed or the number of conductors.

Wait, no, the number of conductors Z is the number of coils multiplied by the number of turns per coil. Wait, each lap coil has two turns, so Z would be 124 * 2 * 2? Because each coil has two turns, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, each coil has two turns, so the total number of conductors Z would be the number of coils times the number of turns per coil times 2? Because each turn has two conductors in series? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me clarify. In a lap winding, the number of parallel paths A is equal to the number of poles P. So for a 4-pole machine, A = 4. That's correct.

The number of armature conductors Z is calculated as the number of coils multiplied by the number of turns per coil. But wait, each coil has two turns, so each coil adds two conductors in series? Or is each turn a separate conductor? Hmm, perhaps I should model each coil as contributing two conductors. So the total number of conductors Z = 124 coils * 2 turns per coil * 2 (since each turn has two conductors). Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, each coil has two turns, so each turn is a loop, which would have two conductors (one on each side). So for each coil, two turns would mean four conductors? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps each lap coil has two conductors in series per turn. So for two turns, each lap coil would contribute 2 conductors. So total conductors Z = 124 * 2 = 248.

Wait, that seems more plausible. Because each lap winding has as many parallel paths as the number of poles. So for 4 poles, A = 4. So now, the generated EMF E is given by E = (P * φ * N * Z) / (60 * A). But wait, without the speed N for part (a), I can't compute it. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The problem states that it's a 4-pole machine with 124 lap coils, each having two turns. So the number of conductors per coil is two, so each coil has two conductors in series? Or perhaps the number of conductors is 124 * 2 = 248? Let me think again.

Wait, each lap coil has two turns. So each turn is a loop, which has two conductors. So two turns would have four conductors per coil. But that would make Z = 124 * 4 = 496. That seems high. Alternatively, perhaps each turn is a single conductor loop, so each coil has two conductors in series. So each coil contributes two conductors, so Z is 124*2=248.

I think that's correct. So Z = 248.

Now, the formula for generated voltage is E = (P * φ * N * Z) / (60 * A). So P is 4, φ is 0.015 Wb, Z is 248, A is 4 (since it's lap winding, A=P).

Wait, but part (a) doesn't give N, the speed. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake. Maybe the speed is given in part (a) as well, but I'm missing it. Let me check the question again.

The question says for part (b), the speed is 1400 rev/min. So part (a) must have a different speed, but it's not given. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Unless I'm supposed to assume a certain speed for part (a), but that's not indicated.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's a different type of machine, like an alternator, but the question says it's a commutator machine, which is a DC machine.

Wait, perhaps part (a) uses a different speed, but the problem doesn't state it. Alternatively, perhaps the speed for part (a) is the same as in part (b), but that's not indicated either. Alternatively, perhaps the speed is not needed for part (a), but that seems impossible because voltage depends on speed.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the speed is given as the relative speed between field and conductor? No, part (b) gives the speed as 1400 rev/min, so maybe part (a) uses a different approach.

Wait, perhaps part (a) is about the maximum voltage, regardless of speed, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to provide the speed for both parts, but it's only given in part (b). Hmm, this is a problem. Maybe I'm missing a key piece of information.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed by assuming that the speed for part (a) is the same as in part (b), 1400 rev/min. But that might not be correct because part (a) and (b) are separate calculations. Alternatively, maybe the speed isn't needed for part (a). Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question has a typo, and the speed is given for part (a) as well. But since it's not, I'm stuck. Alternatively, maybe I can find another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the DC voltage in part (a) is calculated without considering the speed, but that doesn't make sense because the induced EMF depends on speed.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the generated voltage at a specific speed, but I'm not given that. Hmm, maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the given options can help me deduce the correct approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-examine the problem statement. Oh wait, perhaps the question gives the speed in part (a) as well. Let me check again.

No, the question states that for part (b), the relative field/conductor speed is 1400 rev/min. So part (a) must not require the speed, which is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps part (a) uses the same speed, but it's not specified. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with part (a) without the speed and see what happens. But I can't compute the voltage without speed. Maybe I'm missing a key formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps part (a) refers to the voltage when the brushes are placed at quadrature, which might relate to the reactance voltage or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the maximum voltage, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the DC voltage is calculated as E = (φZNP)/(60A). Let's plug in the numbers. But without N, the speed, I can't compute it. So I'm stuck unless I find the speed elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 1400 rev/min for part (a) as well, but the problem only states it for part (b). Alternatively, maybe the speed is given implicitly through the number of conductors and poles. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 1200 rpm or some other standard value, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the speed is given by the number of conductors and poles, but I don't see how.

Wait, maybe I should proceed to part (b) first, using the given speed, and see if that gives me any clues.

For part (b), it's a 3-phase working with three sets of brushes per pole pair. The speed is 1400 rev/min.

In a three-phase machine, the RMS voltage induced in each phase can be calculated using E = (φZNP)/(60 * A), where A is now the number of parallel paths. But wait, for a 3-phase, 4-pole machine, how many parallel paths are there?

Wait, in a three-phase lap winding, the number of parallel paths A is equal to the number of poles P. So A = 4 for part (b).

Wait, no, I think for a three-phase machine with lap winding, the number of parallel paths per phase is P, so A = P =4. So each phase has 4 parallel paths.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, in a three-phase machine, the number of parallel paths might be 2, but I'm not certain. Hmm.

Wait, the formula for RMS voltage in a three-phase machine is E_rms = (φ Z N P) / (60 * sqrt(3) * A), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the phase voltage is given by E_phase = (φ Z N S) / (60 * A), where S is the number of slots per pole per phase, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps for a three-phase machine, the induced EMF per phase is E = (φ Z N) / (60 * A), similar to the DC case, but considering the AC waveform.

Wait, perhaps I should approach part (b) using the same formula as part (a), but adjusted for three phases.

Wait, but in part (a), the DC voltage E_dc is given by E = (PφZN)/(60A). For part (b), it's a three-phase machine, so each phase's RMS voltage would be E_phase = E_dc / sqrt(3), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the RMS voltage is the same as the DC voltage divided by sqrt(3), but that would only apply if it's a star-connected (Y) three-phase system.

Wait, let's think again. In a three-phase machine, the phase voltage is E_phase = (φ Z N P) / (60 * A * something). Hmm, but I'm not recalling the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the RMS voltage for each phase is E_rms = (φ Z N) / (60 * A) * (P/2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the general formula for induced EMF in an AC machine. The RMS EMF per phase is E = (φ Z N P) / (60 * A * 2π) * ω, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach part (a) again, assuming that the speed is the same as in part (b), even though the problem doesn't specify it. Let's proceed with that assumption, perhaps the question intended that.

So for part (a), speed N is 1400 rpm.

So the parameters are:
P = 4 poles
φ = 0.015 Wb
Z = 124 coils * 2 turns each = 248 conductors
A = 4 (since it's a lap winding, A = P)

So E_dc = (P * φ * N * Z) / (60 * A)
Plugging in the numbers:

E_dc = (4 * 0.015 * 1400 * 248) / (60 * 4)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 in numerator and denominator cancels out, so:

E_dc = (0.015 * 1400 * 248) / 60

Calculate step by step:

0.015 * 1400 = 21

21 * 248 = Let's compute that:
21 * 200 = 4200
21 * 48 = 1008
Total = 4200 + 1008 = 5208

Now, 5208 /60 = 86.8 volts.

Wait, but none of the options have 86.8 V for part (a). Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe my assumption about the speed is wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Z or A.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated Z. Let me recheck: 124 lap coils, each with two turns. So each turn is a loop, which has two conductors. So each coil contributes two turns, meaning four conductors per coil? So Z = 124 * 4 = 496.

If Z is 496, then E_dc = (4 * 0.015 * 1400 * 496) / (60 *4) )

Again, 4 cancels out:

(0.015 *1400 *496)/60

0.015 *1400 =21

21 *496 = Let's compute: 500*21=10500, minus 4*21=84, so 10500-84=10416.

10416 /60 = 173.6 volts.

Hmm, 173.6 is close to 175 V, which is option G's part (a). But let me check the options. Option G is a)175 V, b)95 V. Hmm.

Wait, but I'm not sure if Z is 496. Because each lap coil has two turns, but each turn is a conductor loop, so each turn has two conductors. So two turns would have four conductors. So 124 coils would give 124 *4 =496 conductors. So that seems correct.

But then E_dc is 173.6 V, which is about 174 V. Looking at the options, option C is 186 V, option G is 175 V, option I is 190 V.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate:

Z = 124 * 2 turns per coil = 248 conductors, as I thought earlier. Wait, but each turn is a loop, so each turn contributes two conductors. So each coil with two turns contributes four conductors. So Z = 124 * 4 = 496.

So E_dc = (4 *0.015 *1400 *496)/(60*4)

So 4 cancels, so 0.015 *1400 *496 /60.

0.015 *1400 =21.

21 *496 = 21*(500-4) = 10500 -84=10416.

10416 /60 = 173.6 V, which is approximately 174 V. Looking at the options, the closest is option G: a)175 V.

But wait, perhaps I should consider that the number of conductors Z is 124 * 2 = 248, not 496. Because each turn is a single conductor, so two turns per coil give two conductors per coil, so Z=248.

Then E_dc = (4 *0.015 *1400 *248)/(60*4) = (0.015*1400*248)/60.

0.015*1400=21.

21*248= 5208.

5208/60=86.8 V.

But that's not matching any options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of parallel paths A is different. Wait, in part (a), it's a DC machine with quadrature brushes, which probably means it's using a short pitch winding, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is incorrect. Wait, another formula for DC machines is E = (φZNP)/(60A), where A is the number of parallel paths.

So for part (a), A would be the number of parallel paths. In a lap winding, A = P =4. So that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the calculation with Z=248:

E_dc = (4 *0.015 *1400 *248) / (60*4) = (0.015*1400*248)/60.

0.015 *1400 =21.

21*248=5208.

5208/60=86.8 V.

But none of the options have this value. So perhaps I'm miscalculating Z.

Wait, another approach: the number of conductors in a lap winding is given by Z = (number of coils) * (number of turns per coil * 2). Because each turn has two conductors (one on each side). So 124 coils, 2 turns each: Z = 124 * 2 * 2 = 496.

So that brings us back to Z=496 and E_dc=173.6 V, which is close to 175 V, option G's a) 175 V.

But let me look at the options again. Option C is a)186 V, which is a bit higher. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the speed in part (a) is different. Suppose the speed is 1500 rpm instead of 1400. Let's try that.

E_dc = (4 *0.015 *1500 *496)/(60*4)

Again, 4 cancels.

0.015*150
