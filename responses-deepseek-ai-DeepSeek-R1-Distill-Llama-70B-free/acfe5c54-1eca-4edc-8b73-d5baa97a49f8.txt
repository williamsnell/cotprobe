Question:

A cross between two true breeding lines one with dark blue flowers and one with bright white flowers produces F1 offspring that are light blue. When the F1 progeny are selfed a 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers is observed. What genetic phenomenon is consistent with these results?

Options:

A: overdominance
B: polygenic inheritance
C: epistasis
D: pleiotropy
E: lethal alleles
F: genetic drift
G: genetic linkage
H: codominance
I: incomplete dominance
J: inbreeding depression

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about a cross between two true breeding lines. One has dark blue flowers, the other bright white. Their F1 offspring are light blue. Then when the F1s are selfed, the ratio is 1:2:1 for dark blue to light blue to white. I need to figure out which genetic phenomenon this is.

Wait, true breeding lines mean they're homozygous for the trait. So the parents are probably homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive, or maybe both have different alleles. Let's think about the F1 being light blue. So when they cross, the offspring are not showing either parent's phenotype but something in between. That reminds me of incomplete dominance, where the heterozygote shows a blended trait. 

But wait, in incomplete dominance, when the F1 selfs, what happens? Let me recall. If it's a case of incomplete dominance, like snapdragons or four o'clock plants, the F1 is heterozygous. When they self, the F2 would have a ratio of 25% homozygous dominant (dark blue), 50% heterozygous (light blue), and 25% homozygous recessive (white). So that's a 1:2:1 ratio. That matches the question exactly.

So the options given are: A is overdominance, which is when the heterozygote has a higher fitness. But here, the heterozygote's phenotype is just an intermediate, not necessarily better in fitness. So maybe not A.

B is polygenic, which means multiple genes. But the cross is between two true breeding lines, so it's probably a single gene trait. So B might not fit.

C is epistasis, which is when one gene affects another. That seems more complex. The F1 ratio is 1:2:1, which is a typical case for a single gene with certain dominance relationships.

D is pleiotropy, which is one gene affecting multiple traits. Not sure that applies here.

E is lethal alleles. If an allele is lethal, like in a recessive lethal, maybe you'd see a different ratio, like 2:1 in a test cross. But here the ratio is 1:2:1, which doesn't suggest lethality.

F is genetic drift, which is change in allele frequencies due to chance. That's a population genetics concept and doesn't explain the phenotypic ratios here.

G is genetic linkage, which involves genes on the same chromosome. But again, the ratio here points to a single gene.

H is codominance, where both alleles are expressed fully. Like blood types, where AB has both A and B antigens. But in that case, the F1 would show both parents' traits simultaneously, not a blend. So maybe not H.

I is incomplete dominance. That fits, because the heterozygote shows a blend, and when selfed, gives a 1:2:1 ratio.

J is inbreeding depression, which is reduced fitness from inbreeding. Not directly related to the phenotypic ratios observed.

So the correct answer should be I: incomplete dominance. Because the F1 shows a phenotype intermediate between the parents, and upon selfing, the F2 has the 1:2:1 ratio expected from segregation of alleles where neither is completely dominant.

The question involves a genetic cross between two true breeding lines, one with dark blue flowers and the other with bright white flowers. The F1 offspring exhibit light blue flowers, and when selfed, the F2 generation shows a 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers. This pattern suggests a specific genetic phenomenon.

True breeding lines are homozygous for the trait, meaning the parents are likely homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive. The F1 offspring showing an intermediate phenotype (light blue) indicates that neither allele is completely dominant over the other, which is characteristic of **incomplete dominance**. In this case, the heterozygous state produces a blended phenotype.

When the F1 (heterozygous) individuals are selfed, the F2 generation exhibits a 1:2:1 phenotypic ratio. This is consistent with Mendelian inheritance for a single gene with two alleles, where the heterozygote produces an intermediate trait. This ratio aligns perfectly with the concept of incomplete dominance.

Analyzing the options:
- **A (overdominance):** Refers to heterozygotes having higher fitness, which is not relevant here.
- **B (polygenic inheritance):** Involves multiple genes, but the question suggests a single gene trait.
- **C (epistasis):** Involves one gene affecting another, which is unnecessary to explain the observed ratio.
- **D (pleiotropy):** Refers to one gene affecting multiple traits, which is not applicable.
- **E (lethal alleles):** Would likely produce a different phenotypic ratio, such as 2:1.
- **F (genetic drift):** Pertains to population genetics and does not explain the phenotypic ratios.
- **G (genetic linkage):** Involves genes on the same chromosome, which is irrelevant here.
- **H (codominance):** Refers to both alleles being fully expressed, which would not produce a blended phenotype.
- **I (incomplete dominance):** Fits the observed data, as the heterozygote shows a blended phenotype, and the F2 ratio is 1:2:1.
- **J (inbreeding depression):** Refers to reduced fitness from inbreeding, which is unrelated to the phenotypic ratios.

The correct answer is **I: incomplete dominance**, as it explains both the intermediate phenotype in the F1 and the 1:2:1 ratio in the F2 generation.
