Okay, so I've got this question about Chord, a distributed hash table used in peer-to-peer networks. Hmm, I remember that Chord uses a ring-based structure where each node is responsible for a range of keys. The nodes are arranged in a circle, and each node has a successor and a predecessor.

The question states that the address space is 25. So, I'm guessing that the possible keys or node IDs range from 0 to 24 because 2^5 (since 5 is the next power of two after 25, but wait, 25 isn't a power of two. Oh wait, maybe the address space is m bits, so m=5 because 2^5 is 32, but the question says 25. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe the address space is 25, but each node's ID is a 5-bit number, so 0 to 31, but the network only uses 25 of them. Or perhaps the maximum node ID is 25, so IDs go from 0 to 24. The problem says the nodes are N3, N8, N15, N19, N30. Wait, N30 is way higher than 25. That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe the address space is 32, as 2^5 is 32. So the IDs wrap around modulo 32.

So the nodes are N3, N8, N15, N19, N30. So their IDs are 3, 8, 15, 19, and 30. Now, I'm supposed to find the target keys for N3. Wait, target keys? Oh right, in Chord, each node is responsible for certain keys, and the target key for a node is the key that the node is storing. Or wait, maybe I'm thinking of the keys that a node is responsible for. So in Chord, each key is assigned to the node whose ID is the successor of the key. So the target keys for a node are the keys for which that node is the successor.

So to find all the target keys for N3, I need to find the range of keys where N3 is the successor. The way Chord works is that each node's responsible range starts from the node's ID plus 1, up to the predecessor's ID. So for each node, the keys it's responsible for are (predecessor, node ID]. Or wait, maybe it's (predecessor's ID, node's ID], because the keys are modulo 2^5.

Wait, let me think again. In Chord, each node has a finger table that helps in routing. But for the keys, each node is responsible for the keys that are in the range from the node's ID to the next higher node's ID. Or perhaps from the node's predecessor plus one to the node's ID. Because in a ring structure, each node's range starts at the predecessor's next key.

So the process is:

1. Sort all the node IDs in the circle.

In this case, the nodes are 3, 8, 15, 19, 30. But wait, since the address space is 25, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, earlier I thought the address space is 5 bits, which would be 32, not 25. So perhaps the address space is 5 bits, making maximum ID 31. So the nodes would be arranged in the ring from 0 to 31.

So the node IDs are 3, 8, 15, 19, 30.

Let me list them in order around the ring, considering modulo 32. So arranging them in numerical order: 3, 8, 15, 19, 30.

Wait, but 30 is less than 32, so it's fine. Now, the next node after 30 is 3 because it's a ring. So each node is responsible for the range from their predecessor's next to their own ID.

So let's list the nodes in order, considering the ring:

3, 8, 15, 19, 30, 3 (since it wraps around).

So for N3, its predecessor is 30, because in the ring, the nodes go 30 →3→8→15→19→30.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The predecessor of 3 is the node just before it in the ring. So the nodes are ordered as 3,8,15,19,30 in the ring. So the predecessor of 3 is 30, because after 30 comes 3. So the range that N3 is responsible for is from 30 +1 = 31, up to 3, but since it's modulo 32, 31 comes before 0, which comes before 3.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try a different approach. Each node is responsible for the range of keys starting right after its predecessor up to itself.

So for each node, the range is (predecessor, self]. But since it's a ring, if the node is the first one, its predecessor is the last node.

So let's list each node and its predecessor:

- N3's predecessor is N30.
- N8's predecessor is N3.
- N15's predecessor is N8.
- N19's predecessor is N15.
- N30's predecessor is N19.

So for N3, the range is (N30, N3], meaning any key k where N30 < k ≤ N3, considering modulo 32.

N30 is 30, N3 is 3.

So the range is (30, 3]. But since 30 is larger than 3, the range wraps around. So the range includes 31 and 0,1,2,3.

Wait, but in Chord, each node's responsible for the keys from its predecessor's ID +1 to its own ID. So for N3, the range is (30,3], which in modulo 32 terms is 31, 0, 1, 2, 3.

So the keys that N3 is responsible for are 31,0,1,2,3.

But the question says to list the target keys in ascending order, ignoring the node's identifier itself. So the node's ID is 3, so we ignore 3. Wait, no, the target keys are those for which N3 is the successor. So the keys are the ones that fall in the range (predecessor, node ID], which includes 31,0,1,2,3.

So the target keys for N3 would be 0,1,2,3 (excluding 3? Or including? Because the range is up to and including the node's ID. But the question says to ignore the node's identifier itself, so we exclude 3.)

Wait, the question says, "Show all the target key (in ascending order, ignore the node's identifier itself) for N3." So the target keys are the keys that N3 is responsible for, but we exclude N3's own ID.

So the keys are 0,1,2,3. But wait, the range is 31,0,1,2,3. So excluding 3, the keys are 0,1,2,31.

Wait, but the question is about the target keys for N3. So the keys that N3 holds are in the range (30,3], which is 31,0,1,2,3. So the keys are 31,0,1,2,3. But when listed in ascending order, that's 0,1,2,3,31. But since we're to ignore the node's own ID (3), we have 0,1,2,31.

Wait, but the options don't include 0,1,2,31. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: [6, 11, 16, 21, 1] → No, not matching.

Option B: [5, 8, 12, 18, 24] → No.

Option C: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] → No.

Option D: [4,5,7,11,19] → No.

Option E: [7,14,21,28,2] → No.

Option F: [4,6,9,17,22] → No.

Option G: [4,9,16,20,25] → No.

Option H: [3,8,15,19,30] → Those are the node IDs, but the target keys are not these.

Option I: [8,15,19,30,3] → Again, node IDs, not the keys.

Option J: [5,10,15,20,25] → No.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The address space is 25, but perhaps it's 5 bits, which is 32 possible addresses, but only 25 are used. Or maybe the address space is 25, meaning each node is assigned a unique number from 0 to 24. But the given nodes have IDs 3,8,15,19,30. Wait, 30 is larger than 24 if the address space is 25. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the address space is 32 (5 bits), and the nodes are 3,8,15,19,30.

So the possible keys are 0 to 31. So each node is responsible for a certain range.

So for N3, the keys it's responsible for are the ones between its predecessor (N30) and itself, which would be 31,0,1,2,3.

But the question says to list the target keys in ascending order, ignoring the node's own ID (3). So the keys are 0,1,2,31.

Wait, but the options don't have 0,1,2,31. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the target keys are the keys that N3 is responsible for, and the node's own ID is included, but the question says to ignore the node's identifier itself. So in the target keys, exclude 3.

So the keys would be 0,1,2,31. But that's four keys, but the options have five elements. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the number of keys each node is responsible for depends on the number of nodes. Since there are 5 nodes, each node would have 32/5 = 6.4 keys on average, but that's not exact. Alternatively, each node's range is determined by the next node.

Wait, let me try to list all the ranges for each node.

Nodes sorted: 3,8,15,19,30.

So:

- N3's range is (30,3]. So 31,0,1,2,3.

So keys: 31,0,1,2,3.

- N8's range is (3,8]. So 4,5,6,7,8.

- N15's range is (8,15]. So 9,10,11,12,13,14,15.

- N19's range is (15,19]. So 16,17,18,19.

- N30's range is (19,30]. So 20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30.

Wait, but in this case, N3's range is 5 keys (31,0,1,2,3). N8 has 5 keys (4-8), N15 has 7 keys (9-15), N19 has 4 (16-19), and N30 has 11 (20-30). That adds up to 5+5+7+4+11=32 keys, which covers the address space.

But the question is about the target keys for N3, which are 31,0,1,2,3. Excluding 3, the keys are 31,0,1,2.

So that's four keys. But the options have five elements. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the target keys are the ones that N3 holds, including its own ID, but the problem says to ignore the node's identifier itself. So the keys N3 holds are 0,1,2,3,31. But when we ignore 3, we're left with 0,1,2,31. But that's four keys, and the options have five. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the address space as 25, so the IDs are modulo 25, meaning that 30 mod25 is 5. So the nodes are 3,8,15,19,5. Then, the sorted list would be 3,5,8,15,19. Then, each node's range is determined as follows.

So for N3, the predecessor is 19. So the range is (19,3] modulo25. So that would be 20,21,22,23,24,0,1,2,3.

Wait, but 3 is the node's ID. So the keys are 20,21,22,23,24,0,1,2,3. So excluding 3, the keys are 20,21,22,23,24,0,1,2.

That's eight keys. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the address space is 25, so the IDs are 0-24. But N30 would be 30 mod25=5, so N5. But the given node IDs are N3, N8, N15, N19, N30 (which is 5). So the nodes are N3, N5, N8, N15, N19.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the nodes are 3,5,8,15,19.

So sorted, they are 3,5,8,15,19.

Now, each node's range is (predecessor, self].

So N3's predecessor is 19. So range is (19,3]. So 20,21,22,23,24,0,1,2,3.

Excluding 3, the keys are 20,21,22,23,24,0,1,2.

But again, that's eight keys. The options have five keys each, so this seems off.

Wait, perhaps the way the question is phrased is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it. Maybe the address space is 25, but the node IDs are assigned from 1-25, not 0-based. So node IDs are 3,8,15,19,25 (since 30 mod25 is 5, but perhaps 30 is beyond 25, so maybe the address space is 32).

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me check each option to see if any fit.

What's the correct approach here? Let me think again.

In Chord, each node is responsible for the keys in the range (predecessor, node ID]. So for N3, the predecessor is the largest node ID less than 3. Wait, no, that's in an ordered list.

Wait, the nodes are arranged in a circle. So the sorted node IDs are 3,8,15,19,30 (if the address space is 32). So the predecessor of 3 is 30 because after 30 comes 3 in the circle.

So the range for N3 is (30,3], which includes 31,0,1,2,3.

So the keys are 31,0,1,2,3. Excluding 3, the target keys are 31,0,1,2.

But the options don't have this combination.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the next five keys in the range, but each node has more than one key. But that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the keys that N3 would be responsible for when considering the m=5, so each node's responsible for m bits.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the target keys as the keys that N3 is the successor for. So each key is assigned to the successor node.

In this case, for each key k, the successor is found by looking for the smallest node ID greater than k. So for each key, the responsible node is the smallest node ID >=k.

So for example, key 0 would be assigned to N3 because N3 is the first node ID >=0.

Key 1: N3.

Key 2: N3.

Key3: N3.

Key4: N8.

Key5: N8.

Wait, but this seems to suggest that N3 is responsible for keys 0,1,2,3.

Similarly, N8 is responsible for 4-7.

N15 for 8-14.

N19 for 15-18.

N30 for 19-30.

But wait, the address space is 25, so the maximum key is 24. So N30 would be responsible for 19-24, and then the next node after 30 is 3, so key 25 would wrap around to 3? But that can't be because 25 is beyond 24.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe the address space is 32, so keys go up to 31.

So, with nodes 3,8,15,19,30.

Keys:

0-3: N3.

4-7: N8.

8-14: N15.

15-18: N19.

19-30: N30.

31: N3 (since N3 is the next after N30).

So the keys that N3 is responsible for are 0,1,2,3,31.

But the problem says to ignore N3's own ID (3), so the target keys are 0,1,2,31.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is [6,11,16,21,1]. That doesn't fit. Option B is [5,8,12,18,24]. No. Option C is [1,2,3,4,5], which includes 1,2 but also 3, which we're ignoring. So that's not it.

Option D: [4,5,7,11,19]. No.

Option E: [7,14,21,28,2]. No.

Option F: [4,6,9,17,22]. No.

Option G: [4,9,16,20,25]. No.

Option H: [3,8,15,19,30]. These are node IDs, not keys.

Option I: [8,15,19,30,3]. Again, node IDs.

Option J: [5,10,15,20,25]. No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the range. Maybe the keys are 31,0,1,2,3, and when sorted, it's
