Okay, so I've got this question here about logical fallacies, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again: "An arguer who threatens another to gain agreement commits the fallacy of..." and there are ten options to choose from.

First, I remember that logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that can undermine the logic of an argument. They're common mistakes people make when trying to persuade others. So the question is about identifying which specific fallacy occurs when someone threatens another person to get them to agree.

Let me think about each option:

A: Red herring. I think that's when someone introduces an unrelated topic to distract from the issue at hand. Like, if someone changes the subject to avoid talking about the real problem. So that's probably not it because this question is about threatening someone.

B: False analogy. That's when someone makes an analogy between two things that aren't really similar. For example, comparing apples and oranges in a way that's misleading. Doesn't seem to fit here because the scenario is about using threats.

C: Appeal to force. Hmm, the name itself makes me think it's related to using force or threats. I think this fallacy is when someone uses physical or psychological threats to make someone agree. Like, "Agree with me or else..." So this might be the right answer.

D: Appeal to tradition. This is when someone argues that a practice is correct because it's been done that way for a long time. Like, "We've always done it this way, so it must be right." Not related to threats.

E: Circular argument. That's when the conclusion is used as a premise, so the argument just goes in circles. Like, "This is true because it's true." Again, not about threats.

F: False cause. This fallacy occurs when someone incorrectly identifies the cause of an event. For example, thinking that because one event followed another, the first caused the second. Not related to threats.

G: Straw person. This is when someone misrepresents someone else's argument to make it easier to attack. Like, exaggerating or distorting the opposing view. So that's not it either.

H: Appeal to ridicule. This is when someone dismisses an argument by making it look ridiculous, often through sarcasm or mockery, instead of addressing the argument itself. Not about threats.

I: Ignorance of refutation. I think this is when someone claims that because an argument hasn't been refuted, it must be true. Or maybe it's about not addressing counterarguments. Still, not about using threats.

J: Tu quoque. Ah, this means "you too." It's when someone dismisses an argument by pointing out that the arguer is guilty of the same thing they're criticizing. Like, "You're saying I should stop smoking, but you smoke too!" Not related to threats.

So, putting it all together, the scenario is about threatening someone to get their agreement. The fallacy that fits this is "appeal to force," which is option C. That's when the argument relies on force or the threat of force to persuade, rather than logical reasoning. So the answer should be C.

The fallacy in question involves threatening someone to gain agreement, which directly relates to the "appeal to force." This fallacy occurs when an argument relies on threats or force rather than logical reasoning. 

Answer: C
