Okay, so I've got this question about securities and portfolio returns. Hmm, let me think. I remember from my studies that when you have a portfolio with multiple securities, the expected return of the portfolio is the weighted average of the returns of the individual securities. Oh wait, right, weights are usually determined by the proportion of each security in the portfolio.

The question says there are three securities: A, B, and C. Their expected returns are 7%, 12%, and 5% respectively. But the portfolio in question is only composed of A and C, and it's equally weighted. Oh, so that means each of them makes up 50% of the portfolio.

Wait, so even though there's a Security B, it's not part of this portfolio. So I can ignore Security B's return of 12%. The portfolio is just A and C, each with equal weight. So each has a weight of 0.5.

To calculate the expected portfolio return, I should take the sum of each security's return multiplied by its weight. So for Security A: 7% times 0.5, and for Security C: 5% times 0.5. Then add those two together.

Let me do the math. 7% is 0.07, 5% is 0.05. 0.07 * 0.5 is 0.035. 0.05 * 0.5 is 0.025. Adding them together: 0.035 + 0.025 equals 0.06. Oh, wait, 0.06 is 6%. So the expected return of the portfolio is 6%.

Looking at the options, option D is 6.50%, which is 6.5%, and option G is 6%. So the correct answer should be D or G? Wait, wait— my calculation was 6%, which would be 6.0%. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. 7% for A is 7, times 0.5 is 3.5. 5% for C is 5, times 0.5 is 2.5. Adding 3.5 and 2.5 gives 6. So 6% total. So the correct answer is option D? No, option D is 6.50%. Oh wait, no— option D is 6.5% and option G is 6%. So 6% is option G.

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe I'm missing something. The question says "equal weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C." Equal weighting usually means each has the same proportion, so 50% each. So yes, 7% * 0.5 is 3.5, 5% *0.5 is 2.5. Sum is 6%.

So looking at the options: D is 6.50%, which isn't matching. Option G is 6%, which is our result. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let me list them again to make sure. The options are A:10, B:11, C:12, D:6.50, E:7.50, F:9, G:6, H:5, I:8.50, J:7. So yes, option G is 6%, which matches our calculation.

The expected return of an equal-weighted portfolio composed of Securities A and C is calculated by taking the weighted average of their individual returns. Since the portfolio is equally weighted, each security has a weight of 0.5. The calculation is as follows:

- Security A's contribution: \( 7\% \times 0.5 = 3.5\% \)
- Security C's contribution: \( 5\% \times 0.5 = 2.5\% \)

Adding these contributions gives the portfolio's expected return:  
\( 3.5\% + 2.5\% = 6\% \).

Among the provided options, the correct match for 6% is option G.
