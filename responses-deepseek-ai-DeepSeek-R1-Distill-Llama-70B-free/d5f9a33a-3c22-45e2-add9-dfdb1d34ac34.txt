Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about identifying which process is an irreversible reaction from the given options. Hmm, I remember from my classes that reactions can be reversible or irreversible, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

First, I need to recall what irreversible reactions are. Oh right, irreversible reactions are those that proceed in one direction only and don't reach equilibrium. They go to completion, meaning they essentially go all the way to the products, and the reactants aren't regenerated. On the other hand, reversible reactions reach a point where the concentrations of reactants and products stabilize, so you have both reactants and products present at the same time.

Looking at the options, a lot of them have double arrows (↔), which I think indicates reversible reactions. So those would be equilibrium situations. But some have single arrows (→), which might mean they're irreversible. But wait, I remember that sometimes even reactions with a single arrow can still be reversible under certain conditions, but maybe in the context of this question, the arrow direction is a clue.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: H2(g) + I2(g) ↔ 2HI(g). Oh, this is a reversible reaction. I remember that the formation of HI from H2 and I2 is a classic example of a reversible process because it's exothermic and can reverse if conditions change, like increasing temperature.

Option B: HCN(aq) + H2O(l) → CN-(aq) + H3O+(aq). Hmm, this is the dissociation of HCN in water. HCN is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. That means the reaction reaches an equilibrium, so it's reversible. The single arrow might be a simplification, but in reality, it's reversible.

Option C: 2H2O(l) ↔ 2H2(g) + O2(g). This is the electrolysis of water. But wait, water doesn't spontaneously split into hydrogen and oxygen on its own; it requires energy input. However, the reaction as written uses a double arrow, implying it's reversible, but actually, without the energy, it doesn't proceed in reverse. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe this is an electrolysis reaction, which is not spontaneous, so it's not reversible under normal conditions. Wait, but the question is about the process being irreversible. So perhaps this is a non-spontaneous reaction, but I'm not sure if that's the same as being irreversible.

Option D: 2Ag+(aq) + Ti(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ti2+(aq). This looks like a redox reaction. Titanium is reducing silver ions to metallic silver, and itself getting oxidized to Ti²+. I think such redox reactions can sometimes be irreversible, especially if the process is spontaneous. Like, once the silver is plated out, it doesn't go back into solution under the same conditions. So this might be an irreversible reaction.

Option E: PCl5(g) ↔ PCl3(g) + Cl2(g). This is a decomposition reaction. PCl5 can decompose into PCl3 and Cl2, and I believe this is a reversible process because it's an equilibrium. So it's not the answer.

Option F: CH3COOH(l) + CH3OH(l) ↔ CH3COOCH3(l) + H2O(l). This is an acid-catalyzed esterification reaction. I recall that esterification is reversible; it's an equilibrium, so this isn't the answer.

Option G: H2(g) + Cl2(g) ↔ 2HCl(g). This is the formation of HCl from hydrogen and chlorine gases. I think this reaction is exothermic, but it's also reversible because at higher temperatures, it can decompose back. Wait, but under certain conditions, it might proceed to completion. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this one. Maybe it's a reversible reaction because the arrow is bidirectional.

Option H: N2(g) + 3H2(g) ↔ 2NH3(g). This is the Haber process for ammonia synthesis. It's definitely a reversible reaction because it's an equilibrium, so it's not the answer.

Option I: CH4(g) + O2(g) → CO2(g) + H2O(l). This is the combustion of methane. Combustion reactions are typically exothermic and, once the reactants are converted to products, they don't reverse under normal conditions. The products are stable, so this process doesn't go backward. Therefore, this is an irreversible reaction.

Wait, but wait a minute. Methane combustion is highly exothermic, and the products are CO2 and H2O. In reality, could they decompose back? Well, under standard conditions, no, because the reverse would require high energy, which isn't present. So this reaction is considered irreversible.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D's reaction is 2Ag+ + Ti → 2Ag + Ti²+. That's a redox reaction. Silver ions are being reduced to metallic silver, and titanium is oxidized. Once the silver is deposited, it's a solid, so the reaction doesn't reverse unless under different conditions, like applying a reverse current in electrolysis. So that's another candidate for an irreversible process.

So now I have two possible options: D and I.

Let me think again. Irreversible reactions are those that go to completion and don't reverse. Combustion reactions are typically examples of this, as they release a lot of heat and form stable products. So option I's reaction is CH4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O. That's combustion, which is an irreversible process.

Option D, the reaction between Ag+ and Ti, might be a spontaneous redox reaction. Once Ti has oxidized and Ag has been deposited, the reaction doesn't reverse under normal conditions. So that's another irreversible reaction.

Wait, but how many options can be correct? The question asks which of the following is an irreversible reaction. So possibly more than one is irreversible, but the options are from A to J, and the user expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Reversible (double arrow)
B: Reversible (though maybe not if it's a strong acid, but HCN is weak)
C: Double arrow, so it's reversible?
D: Single arrow, redox, likely irreversible
E: Reversible
F: Reversible
G: Reversible
H: Reversible
I: Single arrow, combustion, which is typically irreversible.

So both D and I are candidates.

Wait, but I thought option C is 2H2O(l) → 2H2 + O2 with a double arrow. That's electrolysis, which requires energy. The reverse process (combining H2 and O2 to form water) is combustion, which is spontaneous. So the electrolysis reaction is not spontaneous, so it's not reversible under normal conditions without a power source. So perhaps the reaction is written as an equilibrium, but in reality, it's not. So option C might not be a spontaneous reversible reaction.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, the question's options are about the reaction being irreversible, regardless of whether it's spontaneous or requires energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that reactions with a single arrow (→) are considered irreversible in the context of this question, assuming that the arrow indicates the direction. So let's check which options have single arrows.

Looking at the options:

A: ↔ → reversible
B: → (but it's a weak acid dissociating)
C: ↔
D: →
E: ↔
F: ↔
G: ↔
H: ↔
I: →
J: ? Wait, the options are A-J, but the user only listed up to I.

Wait, the options provided are A through I, because the question lists options A to I. So from the given, options with single arrows are B, D, and I.

But I thought B is HCN dissociation, which is reversible, so why is it a single arrow? Perhaps the question is simplifying, but in reality, it's an equilibrium.

So perhaps the correct answers are D and I.

But wait, the question is a multiple-choice, so only one is correct. So which of the options is an irreversible reaction?

Another approach: think about which reactions are known to be irreversible.

Combustion reactions (like I) are usually considered irreversible because they release a lot of heat and don't tend to reverse unless under extreme conditions. So option I is a combustion reaction, so it's irreversible.

Option D is a redox reaction between silver ions and titanium. Silver has a higher reduction potential than titanium. So when Ti metal is placed in a solution of AgNO3, it will reduce Ag+ to Ag metal, and Ti will oxidize to Ti²+. Once the silver is deposited, it doesn't dissolve back. So this reaction is considered irreversible under these conditions.

So both D and I are irreversible. But wait, looking again, option I's products are CO2 and H2O, which are both stable. So the reaction goes to completion and doesn't reverse, making it irreversible.

So the question is, which option is an irreversible reaction.

So in the options, both D and I are candidates. But the options only allow one correct answer.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

The options provided are A to I.

Option D: 2Ag+ + Ti → 2Ag + Ti²+.

This is a single displacement reaction where titanium displaces silver from its ions. Since it's a metal more active than silver (assuming Ti is more reactive), it will proceed to completion, making it irreversible.

So both D and I are irreversible. But the question is, which of the following is an irreversible reaction. So perhaps more than one is correct, but the options given only have one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each option.

Option B: HCN + H2O → CN⁻ + H3O+. HCN is a weak acid, so this is an equilibrium reaction. So option B is reversible.

So now, the single arrow in options D and I. Let's think about what each represents.

Option D: It's a redox reaction. Once the silver metal is formed, it doesn't go back to Ag+ unless in specific conditions, so it's irreversible under standard conditions.

Option I: Combustion reactions are exothermic and don't reverse; the products are stable, so it's irreversible.

So both D and I are irreversible. But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Looking at the options, which one is the best example of an irreversible reaction.

In the context of the question, perhaps option I is the correct answer because combustion is a classic example of an irreversible reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D because it's a redox reaction that doesn't reverse once the metals have changed.

Hmm. Another angle: in the context of the options, which reactions are typically considered irreversible.

- Combustion (I) is definitely irreversible.
- Redox reactions like D may or may not be irreversible depending on conditions.

Wait, but in a solution, once Ag is plated out, it stays as a solid. The reaction doesn't run in reverse unless you pass an electric current, which isn't the case here. So D is irreversible because it's a spontaneous reaction that doesn't reverse.

So now I'm torn between D and I. But perhaps the question expects I to be the answer because combustion is a more obvious irreversible reaction.

Wait, another thought: the Haber process (H) is a reversible reaction, so it's out. So the options with single arrows are B, D, I.

But B is a weak acid dissociation, which is reversible, so it's not the answer.

So between D and I.

Which one is an irreversible reaction?

In the case of D, once Ti has reacted with Ag+ to form Ag(s) and Ti²+, the reverse reaction (Ag(s) oxidizing Ti²+ back to Ti(s) and Ag+ ) is not spontaneous. So D is an irreversible process.

Similarly, I is a combustion reaction, which is also irreversible.

So both D and I are irreversible.

Wait, but looking back, the question is phrased as "which of the following processes is an irreversible reaction." So perhaps more than one is correct, but the options provided in the question only allow one correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering D as irreversible. Let me think about the solubility. Ag metal is a solid, so the reaction would proceed until all Ag+ is consumed, but in reality, because it's a solid, the concentration doesn't change, so perhaps it's considered to go to completion, making it irreversible.

So given that, perhaps both D and I are correct, but in the options, only one is given as the correct answer.

Wait, the user didn't list the options correctly. Let me recheck: the options are labeled A to I. So the correct answer is either D or I.

Wait, perhaps I should look up whether these specific reactions are considered reversible or irreversible.

But since I can't do that, I'll have to make my best judgment.

Combustion reactions, like option I, are generally irreversible because the products are stable and the reaction releases a lot of energy, making the reverse process highly unlikely without an external energy source.

Option D is a redox reaction where a more reactive metal displaces a less reactive one from its compound. Once the displacement happens, the products are a solid and ions in solution. Since the solid (Ag) doesn't dissolve back under the same conditions, the reaction doesn't reverse, making it irreversible.

So both D and I are irreversible, but the question presents only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Option D: 2Ag+ + Ti → 2Ag + Ti²+.

This is a single replacement (displacement) reaction. In such reactions, if the metal added is more reactive than the metal being displaced, the reaction proceeds, and it's spontaneous. Once Ti has been oxidized and Ag has been deposited, the reverse won't happen without external intervention, so it's an irreversible process.

So perhaps both D and I are correct, but the options may have only one correct answer.

Wait, looking back, the user's question lists the options as A to I, but the correct answer is to pick one.

Alternatively, perhaps one of these is actually a reversible reaction. For example, some redox reactions can be reversible under certain conditions, but in this case, it's a single displacement, which is a one-way reaction.

So perhaps the correct answers are D and I. But since the question gives only one correct option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps option I is written as a single arrow, but in reality, combustion reactions can sometimes have reverse processes under specific conditions, but it's not practical. So perhaps option I is the intended correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing the knowledge of which reactions are considered irreversible. Combustion is a classic example, so option I is correct.

But I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should go with option I as the correct answer.

To determine which process is an irreversible reaction, we analyze the given options:

### Key Concepts:
- **Irreversible reactions** proceed in one direction and do not reach equilibrium under normal conditions. They often involve stable products that do not regenerate reactants spontaneously.
- **Reversible reactions** reach equilibrium, where both reactants and products are present, often indicated by a double arrow (↔).

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A: H₂(g) + I₂(g) ↔ 2HI(g)**  
   This is a reversible reaction. The formation of HI from H₂ and I₂ is a classic equilibrium process.

2. **Option B: HCN(aq) + H₂O(l) → CN⁻(aq) + H₃O⁺(aq)**  
   This represents the dissociation of HCN, a weak acid. While it is shown with a single arrow, it is a reversible equilibrium reaction.

3. **Option C: 2H₂O(l) ↔ 2H₂(g) + O₂(g)**  
   This is the electrolysis of water, which requires an external energy source. While the reaction is reversible in theory, it does not proceed spontaneously in reverse under normal conditions. However, the double arrow suggests equilibrium, so it is not considered irreversible.

4. **Option D: 2Ag⁺(aq) + Ti(s) → 2Ag(s) + Ti²⁺(aq)**  
   This is a redox reaction where titanium reduces silver ions to metallic silver, and titanium is oxidized to Ti²⁺. Once silver is deposited as a solid, the reaction does not reverse under normal conditions, making it irreversible.

5. **Option E: PCl₅(g) ↔ PCl₃(g) + Cl₂(g)**  
   This is a reversible equilibrium reaction, as indicated by the double arrow.

6. **Option F: CH₃COOH(l) + CH₃OH(l) ↔ CH₃COOCH₃(l) + H₂O(l)**  
   This is an acid-catalyzed esterification reaction, which is reversible and reaches equilibrium.

7. **Option G: H₂(g) + Cl₂(g) ↔ 2HCl(g)**  
   This is a reversible reaction. The formation of HCl from H₂ and Cl₂ is an equilibrium process.

8. **Option H: N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ↔ 2NH₃(g)**  
   This is the Haber process for ammonia synthesis, a well-known reversible equilibrium reaction.

9. **Option I: CH₄(g) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + H₂O(l)**  
   This is a combustion reaction. Combustion reactions are highly exothermic and produce stable products (CO₂ and H₂O), which do not spontaneously regenerate reactants. Thus, this is an irreversible reaction.

### Conclusion:
Both **Option D** and **Option I** describe irreversible reactions. However, since the question asks for a single answer, **Option I** is the more classic and obvious example of an irreversible reaction due to the nature of combustion processes.
