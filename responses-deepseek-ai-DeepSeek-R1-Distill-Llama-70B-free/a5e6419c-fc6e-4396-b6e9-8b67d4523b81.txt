Question:

Mr. Lucci put together 5 bags of pens. He put 19 black pens and 12 red pens in each bag. Which expression shows the total number of pens Mr. Lucci put into bags?

Options:

A: 19 × (5 + 12)
B: (5 + 19) × 12
C: 5 - (19 + 12)
D: 5 × (19 + 12)
E: (5 × 19) + 12
F: 12 × (5 + 19)
G: (5 × 19) - 12
H: (5 - 19) × 12
I: 5 + (19 × 12)
J: (5 + 19) + 12

Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what it's about. Mr. Lucci made 5 bags of pens, and in each bag, he put 19 black pens and 12 red pens. The question is asking which expression shows the total number of pens he put into the bags.

Hmm, right, so I think I need to find the total number of pens. Each bag has black and red pens. So per bag, it's 19 black plus 12 red. That makes sense. So for one bag, the total pens would be 19 + 12. Let me calculate that: 19 plus 12 is 31 pens per bag.

But wait, there are 5 bags. So the total number of pens would be 31 pens multiplied by 5 bags. Because each bag has 31, so 5 times 31. So that's 5 × (19 + 12). Because 19 plus 12 is the number per bag, and multiplying by 5 gives the total across all bags.

Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches that expression. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: 19 × (5 + 12). Hmm, that would be 19 multiplied by 17, which is 323. But that's not right because that would mean each bag has 5+12=17 pens, which isn't the case. Each bag has 19 black and 12 red, so adding those makes 31 per bag, not 17.

Option B: (5 + 19) × 12. That would be 24 × 12, which is 288. No, that doesn't make sense. Because 5+19 is 24, but that's not the correct approach. We're not adding the number of bags to the pens and then multiplying by the red pens or something.

Option C: 5 - (19 + 12). That's 5 minus 31, which is negative. That can't be right because the total pens can't be negative. So this option is out.

Option D: 5 × (19 + 12). That's exactly what I was thinking earlier. 19+12 is 31, multiplied by 5 is 155. So this looks right.

Option E: (5 × 19) + 12. That would be 95 +12 =107. Wait, that's not right because it's only considering the black pens across all bags plus 12. But we need to account for both black and red in each bag.

Option F: 12 × (5 + 19). So that's 12 ×24 =288. No, same issue as option B, because it's adding bags and pens incorrectly.

Option G: (5 ×19) -12. 95-12=83. No, that's less than the total and subtracts without reason.

Option H: (5-19) ×12. That's negative 14 ×12= -168. Negative pens don't make sense, so no.

Option I:5 + (19×12). 5 + 228=233. That's way too high. Because 19×12 is 228, adding 5 gives 233, which doesn't fit with our per bag approach.

Option J: (5 +19) +12. That's 24 +12=36. That's just a small number, less than the per bag total, so definitely wrong.

So the correct expression is option D: 5 × (19 + 12). That correctly calculates the total pens by adding the per bag counts and then multiplying by the number of bags.

The total number of pens Mr. Lucci put into bags can be determined by first calculating the number of pens in one bag and then multiplying by the number of bags. Each bag contains 19 black pens and 12 red pens, so the total per bag is \(19 + 12 = 31\) pens. Since there are 5 bags, the total number of pens is \(5 \times (19 + 12)\).

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: \(19 \times (5 + 12)\) incorrectly adds the number of bags to the number of red pens before multiplying.
- **B**: \((5 + 19) \times 12\) incorrectly adds the number of bags to the number of black pens before multiplying.
- **C**: \(5 - (19 + 12)\) results in a negative number, which is not possible for the total number of pens.
- **D**: \(5 \times (19 + 12)\) correctly calculates the total by adding the pens per bag and then multiplying by the number of bags.
- **E**: \((5 \times 19) + 12\) only accounts for the black pens across all bags, ignoring the red pens in each bag.
- **F**: \(12 \times (5 + 19)\) incorrectly adds the number of bags to the number of black pens before multiplying.
- **G**: \((5 \times 19) - 12\) subtracts without reason and does not represent the total number of pens.
- **H**: \((5 - 19) \times 12\) results in a negative number, which is not possible for the total number of pens.
- **I**: \(5 + (19 \times 12)\) incorrectly calculates the total by multiplying only the black pens by the number of red pens and then adding the number of bags.
- **J**: \((5 + 19) + 12\) does not account for the multiplication by the number of bags.

The correct expression is **D: \(5 \times (19 + 12)\)**.
