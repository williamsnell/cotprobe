Okay, so I've got this math problem here about ABC Publications buying paper. Let's see what it's asking. Hmm, I need to find out how much they paid after taking the cash discount. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem says they bought 50 reams of paper at $2.76 each. So the initial cost would be 50 times $2.76. Let me calculate that. 50 * 2.76... well, 50 times 2 is 100, and 50 times 0.76 is 38, so 100 + 38 is $138. So the total before any discounts is $138.00.

Next, there's a 50-10% discount. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, trade discounts are often written like that. So I think a 50-10% discount means that the first discount is 50% off, and then an additional 10% off. Or wait, no, maybe it's a series of discounts? Or perhaps it's a single discount rate. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, I remember that trade discounts are sometimes given in a series, like 50% then an additional 10%. So first, calculate 50% off the total, and then take 10% off the result. Let me try that.

So the original total is $138.00. A 50% discount would be half of that, so 138 * 0.5 = $69.00. Now, applying the additional 10% discount on this amount. 10% of 69 is 6.9, so subtracting that gives 69 - 6.9 = $62.10. So after the trade discounts, the amount is $62.10.

But wait, there's another discount if payment is made within 10 days. That's a 1% cash discount. So I need to apply that 1% to the $62.10. Let me calculate that. 1% of 62.10 is 0.621. Subtracting that gives 62.10 - 0.621 = $61.479. Hmm, which is approximately $61.48 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Looking at the options, B is $61.48. So the answer should be B.

Wait, let me double-check the trade discount part. Did I apply it correctly? Another way to think is that the trade discount is 50% followed by 10%. So the total discount factor is 0.5 * 0.9 = 0.45. So 45% of the original price. So 138 * 0.45 = 62.10. Yeah, same as before. Then the 1% off: 62.10 * 0.99 = 61.479, which is 61.48. So yes, B is correct.

The problem involves calculating the final amount paid by ABC Publications after applying both a trade discount and a cash discount. 

1. **Calculate the total cost before discounts**:  
   ABC Publications bought 50 reams of paper at $2.76 each.  
   Total = \( 50 \times 2.76 = 138.00 \).

2. **Apply the trade discount (50% followed by 10%)**:  
   - First, apply a 50% discount:  
     \( 138.00 \times 0.5 = 69.00 \).  
   - Then, apply an additional 10% discount on the result:  
     \( 69.00 \times 0.9 = 62.10 \).  

3. **Apply the 1% cash discount for payment within 10 days**:  
   \( 62.10 \times 0.99 = 61.479 \), which rounds to \( 61.48 \).  

Thus, the final amount paid is **$61.48**, corresponding to option **B**.
