Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says an object starts from rest and is given an acceleration of 16 feet per second squared for 3 seconds. I need to find its speed at the end of those 3 seconds. The options are A through J, with various numbers.

Hmm, right. I remember that when an object starts from rest, its initial velocity is zero. So the initial velocity, u, is 0. The acceleration, a, is given as 16 ft/s², and the time, t, is 3 seconds. I think the formula to find the final velocity in this case is v = u + a*t. Yeah, that sounds right because velocity changes with acceleration over time.

So plugging in the numbers, u is 0, so v equals 0 plus 16 multiplied by 3. Let me do that math. 16 times 3 is 48. So the velocity should be 48 feet per second after 3 seconds.

Looking at the options, option A is 48 ft per sec. So that must be the correct answer. I don't think I need to consider any other formulas here because it's a straightforward constant acceleration problem with initial velocity zero. There's no mention of distance or anything else that might require a different approach.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Another formula I know is s = ut + ½ a t², which gives displacement. But since the question is asking for speed, which in this case is the final velocity, the first formula should be correct. Yeah, I think I'm confident with that.

The object starts from rest, so its initial velocity \( u \) is 0. The acceleration \( a \) is 16 ft/s², and the time \( t \) is 3 seconds. Using the formula for final velocity \( v = u + a \cdot t \), we substitute the values: 

\[
v = 0 + 16 \cdot 3 = 48 \, \text{ft/s}.
\]

Thus, the speed at the end of 3 seconds is 48 ft/s. Among the options provided, the correct answer is **A**.
