Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about general partnerships and profit sharing. Hmm, I remember learning a bit about partnerships in my business law class. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that the partners have agreed only on voting percentage, and their voting shares are unequal. I need to figure out how the profits are shared in this case. The options are A through J.

Wait, in a general partnership, if the partners don't specify how profits are divided, I think the default is that they split them equally. But wait, does that apply here? Because the question says they've agreed on voting percentages which are unequal. So maybe that affects the profit-sharing somehow.

I remember that in a partnership, the sharing of profits is separate from voting rights or ownership percentages. Unless specified otherwise, profits are shared equally, regardless of capital contributions or other factors. But if the partners have an agreement that specifies profit-sharing, that's what they follow. If not, it's equal.

But wait, the question says they've only agreed on voting percentages. So they have unequal voting shares. So their agreement is about voting, not about profit sharing. So does that mean the profits are shared equally, or in another way?

Wait, another thought: in the absence of an agreement on profit-sharing, each partner gets an equal share, regardless of their capital contribution or role. So if the only agreement is about voting, then the profit-sharing must be equal.

Looking at the options, option I says "Partners share equally." That seems to fit. Let me go through the other options to make sure.

Option A: Experience and expertise. I don't think that's the default unless agreed. So no.

Option B: Contributions to capital/assets. That's the default in some cases, but I think in general partnerships, it's equal unless stated otherwise. So if they didn't agree on that, it's not B.

Option C: Voting percentage. Hmm, that's about how decisions are made, but does that affect profit-sharing? I don't think so. Profit-sharing isn't tied to voting shares unless specified.

Option D: Unanimous agreement. That sounds like it's about when they can distribute, not how they split the profits.

Option E: Role in partnership. No, that's not the default.

Option F: Predetermined ratio. That would require an agreement, which the question says they didn't make except for voting.

Option G: Time spent. No, that's not standard.

Option H: Third-party arbitrator. No, that's not the usual case.

Option J: Individual profits. That doesn't make much sense because the profits are for the partnership as a whole.

So the correct answer should be I: Partners share equally.

In a general partnership, the default rule for profit sharing is that partners share equally unless there is an explicit agreement stating otherwise. The question specifies that the partners have only agreed on voting percentages, with no mention of profit-sharing arrangements. Since voting percentages do not automatically determine profit-sharing ratios, the profits must be shared equally among the partners. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, E, G, J**: These options suggest profit-sharing based on factors like experience, capital contributions, role, time spent, or individual profits, none of which apply here as there is no agreement on these factors.
- **C**: Voting percentage does not determine profit-sharing unless explicitly agreed upon, which it is not in this case.
- **D, H**: These options pertain to distribution processes or third-party arbitration, which are unrelated to the default profit-sharing rule.
- **F**: A predetermined ratio would require an agreement, which the question states does not exist.
- **I**: This correctly reflects the default rule of equal profit-sharing in the absence of an agreement.

Thus, the correct answer is **I: Partners share equally.**
