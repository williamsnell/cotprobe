Okay, so I need to solve this subtraction problem: 142.76 minus 16.5. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty on my math, but I think I can figure it out step by step.

First, I'll write down the numbers to make it clearer. So, 142.76 is the larger number, and I'm subtracting 16.5 from it. I remember that when subtracting decimals, it's important to line up the decimal points to keep the digits in the right place value.

Let me set it up like a vertical subtraction problem:

```
 142.76
-  16.5
```

Wait, the second number has only one decimal place. To make it easier, I can add a zero so that both numbers have two decimal places. So 16.5 becomes 16.50. Now it looks like:

```
 142.76
-  16.50
```

Okay, now I'll subtract each column starting from the rightmost digit, which is the hundredths place.

Starting with the hundredths place: 6 minus 0 is 6. That's easy.

Next, the tenths place: 7 minus 5 is 2. So far, so good.

Moving to the ones place: 2 minus 6. Oh wait, I can't subtract 6 from 2 because 2 is smaller. So I need to borrow from the next higher place. The next digit is in the tens place, which is 4. I'll borrow 1 from the 4, making it 3, and adding 10 to the 2, making it 12. Now, 12 minus 6 is 6.

Now the tens place: After borrowing, it's 3 minus 1 (from 16.50). Wait, no, the tens place in 16.50 is 1. So 3 minus 1 is 2.

Finally, the hundreds place: 1 minus 0 is 1.

Putting it all together, the result is 126.26. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

Alternatively, I can try adding 16.5 to 126.26 to see if I get 142.76. Let's see:

126.26 + 16.5 = ?

Adding the decimals first: 0.26 + 0.5 = 0.76. Then adding the whole numbers: 126 + 16 = 142. So yes, 142.76. That checks out.

Looking at the options, option A is 126.26, which matches my result. So the answer should be A.
