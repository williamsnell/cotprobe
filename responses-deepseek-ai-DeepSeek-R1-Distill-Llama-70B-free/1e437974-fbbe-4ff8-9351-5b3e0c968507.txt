Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about passive personality jurisdiction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my international law terms, but I'll try to think through this.

First, I remember that jurisdiction refers to which country has the authority to try a case. There are several types like territorial, nationality, universal, and maybe others. Passive personality, I think, is one of them.

Wait, active personality jurisdiction is when a country claims jurisdiction over its nationals who commit crimes abroad, right? So the focus is on the nationality of the offender. But passive personality must be the opposite. Instead of the offender's nationality, maybe it's based on the victim's nationality.

So, if a crime is committed against a citizen of a country, that country might claim jurisdiction even if the crime happened elsewhere. For example, if a French citizen is harmed in another country, France might want to prosecute the offender under passive personality jurisdiction.

Looking at the options now. Option D says it's based on the nationality of the victims. That sounds right. Option B is about the offender's nationality, which would be active personality. So D is probably the correct answer.

Other options: A is where a legal person is registered, which might relate to corporate jurisdiction. C is about the relationship between victim and offender, which I don't think is a standard basis. E is severity, which isn't a specific jurisdiction type. F is where the crime was planned, which is more about the planning aspect. G is international law, which is too broad. H is residence of the offender, which is different. I is where the offence was committed, that's territorial jurisdiction. J is nationality of the witness, which I don't think is a thing.

So yeah, D must be the right choice.

The question asks about passive personality jurisdiction, which is a legal concept where a country claims the right to prosecute someone based on the nationality of the victim, even if the crime was committed elsewhere. This is different from active personality jurisdiction, which focuses on the nationality of the offender. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A** refers to where a legal person is registered, which is unrelated.
- **B** is about the offender's nationality, which is active personality jurisdiction.
- **C** is about the victim-offender relationship, not a standard jurisdiction basis.
- **D** correctly identifies passive personality jurisdiction based on the victim's nationality.
- **E** refers to the severity of the offence, not a specific jurisdiction type.
- **F** is about where the crime was planned, which is more related to planning aspects.
- **G** is too broad, as international law covers many areas.
- **H** is about the offender's residence, a different jurisdiction type.
- **I** is territorial jurisdiction, based on where the crime occurred.
- **J** is about the witness's nationality, which isn't relevant here.

Thus, the correct answer is **D**.

D
