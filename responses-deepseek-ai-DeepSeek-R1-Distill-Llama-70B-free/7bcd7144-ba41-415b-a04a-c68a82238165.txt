Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about ethics, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is: "_______ and _______ are both examples of _______ -based theories which are based on basic universal principles of right and wrong."

The options are from A to J, each pairing two theories with a base type.

Hmm, I remember from my philosophy class that ethical theories are often categorized into different types. The main ones I recall are consequentialist, deontological, virtue ethics, and maybe relativism. I think I need to figure out which two theories fit into which category based on their underlying principles.

So the sentence structure is: [Theory1], [Theory2] are examples of [Base]-based theories, which rely on universal principles of right and wrong.

Wait, so the question is asking for two theories that are both based on the same type, and that type is based on universal principles. I think theories that are principle-based are often deontological, because deontological ethics focuses on duties and rules. Consequentialist theories, on the other hand, focus on the outcomes of actions, like utilitarianism.

Let me look at the options. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Egoism, Ethics of rights and justice, Consequentialist. Wait, egoism is about self-interest, and I think it can be a form of consequentialism because it's about the consequences for oneself. Ethics of rights and justice—maybe that's more deontological, like Kant's theories. So if the base is consequentialist, that might not fit both.

Option B: Ethics of rights and justice, Egoism, Deontological. Hmm, Ethics of rights and justice sounds deontological. Egoism, though, I'm not sure. If the base is deontological, then both should be. But I'm not sure if egoism is deontological. Egoism is more about consequences for the self, so maybe it's a form of consequentialism. So maybe this option isn't correct.

Option C: Egoism, Utilitarianism, Deontological. Wait, both egoism and utilitarianism are consequentialist theories because they focus on outcomes. If the base is deontological, that wouldn't fit. So this option is probably wrong.

Option D: Utilitarianism, Ethics of duty, Relativist. Relativist theories don't rely on universal principles, they depend on cultural or personal variations. So if the base is relativist, the statement says it's based on universal principles, which would contradict. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: Utilitarianism, Egoism, Principle. Principle-based—so maybe deontological? But utilitarianism is consequentialist, so this doesn't fit. So E is wrong.

Option F: Ethics of rights and justice, Utilitarianism, Virtue. Virtue ethics focuses on character traits, not on principles of right and wrong per se. So this might not fit. Also, the two theories here are ethics of rights (possibly deontological) and utilitarianism (consequentialist), so they belong to different bases. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Ethics of duty, Ethics of rights and justice, Principle. Both of these sound deontological because they're about duties and rights. Principle-based would align with deontological, which is about universal principles. So this could be correct. Let me hold on to G as a possible answer.

Option H: Egoism, Ethics of duty, Relativist. As before, relativism doesn't fit with universal principles, so H is out.

Option I: Ethics of duty, Utilitarianism, Consequentialist. Ethics of duty is deontological, and utilitarianism is consequentialist. So they're under different bases. The base here is consequentialist, but only utilitarianism fits, not ethics of duty. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Ethics of duty, Egoism, Virtue. Ethics of duty is deontological, egoism is probably consequentialist, and virtue is its own category. So J is mixing different bases, so it's wrong.

Wait, going back. The question is about two theories that are both examples of the same base. So G says Ethics of duty and Ethics of rights and justice are both principle-based. That makes sense because both are deontological. Deontological theories are about duties, rights, and adherence to rules, so they rely on universal principles.

So the correct option should be G, where both are examples of principle-based (deontological) theories.

The question asks which two ethical theories are examples of a specific type of theory based on universal principles of right and wrong. To determine the correct answer, it's important to analyze the options and align them with the correct category of ethical theories.

- **Option A**: Egoism and Ethics of rights and justice are paired with Consequentialist. Egoism can be seen as consequentialist, but Ethics of rights and justice align more with deontological ethics, making this option inconsistent.
- **Option B**: Ethics of rights and justice and Egoism are paired with Deontological. While Ethics of rights and justice fit the deontological category, egoism is more aligned with consequentialism, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Egoism and Utilitarianism are paired with Deontological. Both egoism and utilitarianism are consequentialist theories, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Utilitarianism and Ethics of duty are paired with Relativist. Relativism does not rely on universal principles, contradicting the question's focus, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option E**: Utilitarianism and Egoism are paired with Principle. Utilitarianism is consequentialist, not principle-based, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option F**: Ethics of rights and justice and Utilitarianism are paired with Virtue. Virtue ethics focuses on character traits, not universal principles, and the two theories belong to different categories, making this option incorrect.
- **Option G**: Ethics of duty and Ethics of rights and justice are paired with Principle. Both theories are deontological, focusing on universal principles of right and wrong, making this option correct.
- **Option H**: Egoism and Ethics of duty are paired with Relativist. Relativism contradicts the idea of universal principles, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option I**: Ethics of duty and Utilitarianism are paired with Consequentialist. Ethics of duty is deontological, while utilitarianism is consequentialist, so this option is incorrect.
- **Option J**: Ethics of duty and Egoism are paired with Virtue. Ethics of duty is deontological, egoism is consequentialist, and virtue ethics is a separate category, making this option incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option G**, as both Ethics of duty and Ethics of rights and justice are deontological theories based on universal principles of right and wrong.
