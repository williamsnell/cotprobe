Okay, so I've got this question about the Box-Pierce Q test and the Ljung-Box Q* test. Hmm, I remember these are used for testing linear dependence in time series, specifically for checking if there's autocorrelation in the residuals. The question is asking which statement is incorrect when comparing these two tests.

Let me try to recall what I know about these tests. I think both tests are used to determine whether a time series is white noise, meaning no autocorrelation. But they must have some differences in how they're calculated or perform under different conditions.

The options are A through D. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Asymptotically, the values of the two test statistics will be equal. Wait, I remember that both tests are based on the same idea but calculated differently. The Box-Pierce Q uses the sum of squared autocorrelation coefficients up to a certain lag, each divided by the number of observations. Ljung-Box, on the other hand, adjusts each term by the sample size, which I think makes it more accurate in small samples. But as the sample size grows (asymptotically), these differences might become negligible. So maybe their values become similar when n is large. So A might be correct, but I'm not sure yet.

Option B: The Q test has better small-sample properties than the Q*. No, wait. I think the opposite is true. The Ljung-Box test (Q*) is known to have better performance with small samples. Because the Box-Pierce test tends to have a higher probability of Type I error, meaning it's oversized in small samples. So B is incorrect, which would make B the wrong statement. But I need to check the other options to be sure.

Option C: The Q test is sometimes over-sized for small samples. Over-sized means the test rejects the null more than it should, right? So if the null is that there's no autocorrelation, an over-sized test would incorrectly reject it too often. I think Box-Pierce (Q) does have this issue in small samples. So C is correct, meaning the statement is correct, not incorrect. So it's not the answer we're looking for.

Option D: As the sample size tends to infinity, both tests will tend to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation. Wait, no. If the null is true (no autocorrelation), as n increases, the test statistics should follow a chi-square distribution. If your model is correctly specified (no autocorrelation), the tests should not always reject the null. Unless the model is wrong, but the question states the null is zero autocorrelation. So if the null is true, as n grows, the power of the test increases, but the size remains correct. Wait, but if the model is actually false, then both tests would tend to reject. But the statement says "tend to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation". So if the null is true, they shouldn't reject. But if the null is false, they would. So the statement is incorrect because it's making a general statement. Or wait, maybe the statement is correct. Hmm, I'm not too sure about D. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is about which statement is incorrect. So which statement is wrong.

So going back:

Option B says Q has better small-sample properties than Q*, which is incorrect because Q* (Ljung-Box) is better in small samples. So B is incorrect. So the incorrect statement is B, making B the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure. Oh wait, the options are asking for the incorrect statement. So which statement is wrong.

The question is which is incorrect. So:

Option B claims the Q test (Box-Pierce) has better small-sample properties than the Q* (Ljung-Box). But from what I remember, the Ljung-Box test is an improvement over Box-Pierce, especially in small samples. So B is incorrect.

So the incorrect statement is B. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but let me double-check the other options to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Option D: As n tends to infinity, both tests will show a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis. If the null is true, the tests should not reject. But if the null is false, they would. The statement doesn't specify, so it's a bit ambiguous. But the statement implies that regardless of whether the null is true or not, as n increases, they'll reject. That can't be correct. But the statement is asserting that, so that would make D incorrect.

Wait, so the question is which statement is incorrect. So if D is incorrect, that's another possibility.

Wait, in reality, if the null hypothesis is true (zero autocorrelation), then as n increases, the test statistics would have higher power, but the type I error (incorrectly rejecting) should be controlled if the test is correctly sized. But Box-Pierce test is known to be oversized in small samples. However, for D, it's saying that as n tends to infinity, the tests will always reject the null. That's not correct if the null is true. Because with the null being true, and correct size, the tests should not always reject. But if the null is not true, they would.

Wait, but the statement in D says "tend to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients." So it's making a general statement, regardless of whether the null is true or not. That's not correct. Because if the null is true, the tests shouldn't reject. So D is an incorrect statement. But wait, the question is about which statement is incorrect in comparing the two tests.

Wait, the options are about the comparison between Q and Q*. So perhaps the incorrect statement is about their properties.

Wait, the question is about the incorrect statement comparing Q and Q*, not about their general behavior.

Let me re-examine each option:

Option A: Asymptotically, the two test statistics' values are equal. I think as n becomes large, their test statistics should both approach the same chi-square distribution, so their values would be similar. So A is correct.

Option B: Q has better small-sample properties than Q*. No, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Q is sometimes over-sized for small samples. Yes, that's correct, so C is correct.

Option D: As n tends to infty, both tests tend to always reject the null. Wait, if the null is true, in the limit, the tests would have power against any fixed alternative, but if the null is true, the test should not reject. So D is incorrect because it's saying they will always reject, but that's only when the null is false. So D is an incorrect statement because it's making a universal claim.

Wait, but the question is about which of the statements is incorrect concerning their comparison. So in that case, if D is incorrect, then that would be another contender.

Wait, but the question is about the comparison of the two tests. So in reality, both tests are similar in that when the null is false, their power increases as n increases, leading to more rejections. But if the null is true, the tests should maintain their significance level and not always reject. So the statement D is incorrect because it's not conditional on the null being true or false. So the statement is incorrect because it's implying that regardless of the situation, as n increases, both tests always reject the null. That's not correct.

So now I'm a bit confused. Option B and D are both possibly incorrect.

But the question is about the incorrect statement comparing the two tests.

Looking back at the question: "Which of the following statements is INCORRECT concerning a comparison of the Box-Pierce Q and the Ljung-Box Q* statistics for linear dependence in time series?"

So which option is incorrect about their comparison.

Option B is incorrect because it's the opposite: Q* has better small sample properties than Q.

Option D: As n tends to infty, both tests will tend to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation.

I think the statement in D is incorrect because whether they reject depends on whether the null is true or not. If the null is true, as n increases, they won't necessarily reject. But if the null is false, they will. So the statement is incorrect because it's making a generalization that doesn't hold. So D is incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about the comparison between the two tests. So it's possible that both tests have the same behavior in that regard. So the incorrect statement is that they will always reject, regardless of the situation, which is not true. So D is incorrect.

So now I'm a bit torn between B and D as the incorrect statements.

But the question is about which is incorrect concerning their comparison. So looking again:

Option D: As the sample size tends towards infinity, both tests will show a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients.

Wait, if the null hypothesis is true (i.e., no autocorrelation), as n increases, both tests would have higher power against any fixed alternative, but if the null is true, they would not reject. So the statement is incorrect because it's not always the case. So D is incorrect.

So which is the incorrect statement in the question? The question is about which statement is incorrect concerning the comparison.

Let me think about each option again:

Option B: Q has better small sample properties than Q*. No, that's incorrect because Q* is better, so B is wrong.

Option D: As n→infty, both tests will tend to always reject the null hypothesis. That's incorrect because if the null is true, they wouldn't. So D is incorrect.

So both B and D are incorrect? But I can only choose one. Wait, the options are A to D, so four options. The question is multiple choice, so only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me rephrase each option.

Option D says that as n tends to infinity, both tests will show a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis. If the null is true, the tests shouldn't reject. So D is incorrect. But if the null is false, both tests would tend to reject. So the statement is not universally true. So D is incorrect.

So the incorrect statements are B and D. But the question is which is incorrect.

Wait, the question is which statement is incorrect about their comparison. So which of the four is incorrect.

Going back, in the lecture notes or textbook, I think the main issue is that the Box-Pierce test can be oversized in small samples, while the Ljung-Box adjusts for sample size, making it better in small samples. So statement B is incorrect because it says the opposite.

So the answer would be option B is incorrect.

Wait, but what about D? Is D incorrect?

Yes, D is also incorrect, but perhaps that's not one of the options. The question is about which statement is incorrect concerning the comparison between Box-Pierce and Ljung-Box.

Hmm, perhaps I should prioritize based on which is more clearly incorrect.

In the options, the incorrect statement is B because it's about small sample properties, which is a direct comparison. D is a statement that's incorrect in general, but perhaps it's not comparing the two tests but their behavior under certain conditions.

So I think the incorrect statement is B. So the answer is B.
</think>

To determine which statement is incorrect concerning the comparison of the Box-Pierce Q and Ljung-Box Q* statistics, let us analyze each option:

### Option A: 
"Asymptotically, the values of the two test statistics will be equal."  
Both tests are based on the sum of squared autocorrelation coefficients but differ in their calculation. However, as the sample size \( n \) becomes large, the differences between the two tests diminish, and their values tend to converge. Therefore, this statement is **correct**.

---

### Option B: 
"The Q test has better small-sample properties than the Q*."  
This is **incorrect**. The Ljung-Box Q* test is known to have better small-sample properties compared to the Box-Pierce Q test. The Box-Pierce test tends to be oversized in small samples, meaning it rejects the null hypothesis more frequently than it should. Thus, this statement is **incorrect**.

---

### Option C: 
"The Q test is sometimes over-sized for small samples."  
This is **correct**. The Box-Pierce Q test is indeed known to be over-sized in small samples, meaning it has a higher probability of Type I error (incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis). Therefore, this statement is **correct**.

---

### Option D: 
"As the sample size tends towards infinity, both tests will show a tendency to always reject the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation coefficients."  
This statement is **incorrect**. If the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation is true, neither test should always reject the null hypothesis, even as \( n \) increases. Instead, the tests should maintain their significance level. If the null hypothesis is false, both tests would indeed tend to reject it as \( n \) increases. However, the statement makes a universal claim that does not account for whether the null hypothesis is true or false, making it **incorrect**.

---

### Conclusion:  
Both options B and D are incorrect. However, the question specifically asks for the incorrect statement concerning the **comparison** of the two tests. Option B directly compares the small-sample properties of the Box-Pierce Q and Ljung-Box Q* tests and is clearly incorrect, as the Ljung-Box Q* test is superior in small samples. Therefore, the best answer is:

**B**
