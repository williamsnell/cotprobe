Okay, let's see. I have this problem where Spark Co. is buying cordless phones and selling them. I need to find out how many units they must sell to achieve a desired profit of 10% of sales. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's get the given data clear. The cost per phone is $125, and they sell each for $200. So the selling price per unit is $200. They pay a sales commission of $25 per phone sold. Also, there are fixed costs every month amounting to $3000. And the desired profit is 10% of sales. So I need to find the number of units, let's call that 'x', that they need to sell to meet this profit target.

Wait, wait. Profit is usually calculated as total revenue minus total costs. But here, the desired profit is 10% of sales. So, profit = 0.10 * total sales. So I need to set up an equation where Profit equals 10% of Sales.

Let me structure this. 

Total Sales (Revenue) would be the number of units sold times the selling price per unit. So Revenue = x * 200.

Total Variable Costs would be the cost per unit plus the commission per unit, because both are costs that depend on the number of units sold. So variable costs per unit are 125 (cost) +25 (commission) = 150 per unit. So total variable costs = x * 150.

Fixed costs are $3000, which don't change with the number of units sold.

So the total cost is variable costs + fixed costs, which is 150x + 3000.

Profit is then Revenue minus Total Costs. So Profit = (200x) - (150x + 3000) = 50x - 3000.

But the desired profit is 10% of sales. Sales is the same as revenue, which is 200x. So desired profit is 0.10 * 200x = 20x.

So I can set up the equation:

50x - 3000 = 20x

Wait, wait. Because the profit equals 20x. So solving for x.

Subtract 20x from both sides: 30x - 3000 = 0.

Then, 30x = 3000.

Divide both sides by 30: x = 100.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my equations.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the profit equation.

Let me think again. Profit is 10% of sales, so Profit = 0.10 * (200x) = 20x.

On the other hand, Profit is also (Selling Price - Variable Costs) * x - Fixed Costs.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently.

Contribution per unit is selling price minus variable costs. Variable costs include both the cost to buy the phone and the commission. So variable cost per unit is 125 +25 = 150. So contribution per unit is 200 -150 = 50.

So total contribution is 50x.

Fixed costs are 3000. So profit is total contribution minus fixed costs: Profit =50x - 3000.

But desired profit is 10% of sales. Sales are 200x, so 0.10*200x =20x.

Set 50x -3000=20x. Subtract 20x: 30x=3000 → x=100.

Wait, but 100 isn't among the options I've listed. Hmm, the options given are A:400, B:1000, and so on. The closest is J:100, but that's option J.

Wait, but let me double-check my approach because maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, the desired profit is 10% of sales, not 10% of revenue. Oh wait, sales and revenue are the same here. So maybe my equations are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the desired profit is 10% of sales, meaning the profit margin is 10%. But that would usually be profit divided by sales. So in that case, profit =0.10 * sales.

Yes, that's what I did. So according to this, x is 100 units. But looking at the options, option J is 100, which isn't one of the more prominent options, but perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculating the contribution. Let me check again.

Selling price per unit: 200.

Variable costs per unit: 125 (purchase) +25 (commission) =150. So yes, contribution is 50 per unit.

So total contribution is 50x.

Fixed costs are 3000. So profit is 50x -3000.

Desired profit is 20x (0.10 *200x).

Set 50x -3000 =20x → 30x =3000 → x=100.

So the answer would be 100 units, which is option J. But wait, I don't see option J in the first list I was given. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A:400

B:1000

C:600

D:800

E:500

F:200

G:900

H:700

I:300

J:100

Yes, option J is 100. So that would be the correct answer. But let me think again: is there another way this could be approached?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the desired profit calculation. Because sometimes, profit is calculated on investment or something else, but the question says profit is 10% of sales, so 10% of revenue.

Alternatively, let me think about the total desired profit as 10% of sales, which is 0.10 *200x =20x.

But the actual profit is 50x -3000. So setting them equal: 50x -3000=20x → 30x=3000 → x=100.

So yes, that seems correct. So the answer should be J:100.

To determine how many units Spark Co. must sell to achieve a desired profit of 10% of sales, we start by defining the variables and given data:

- **Selling price per unit**: $200  
- **Cost per unit**: $125  
- **Sales commission per unit**: $25  
- **Fixed costs**: $3000  
- **Desired profit**: 10% of sales  

### Step 1: Calculate total revenue and total costs
- **Total Revenue**: \( \text{Revenue} = 200x \), where \( x \) is the number of units sold.  
- **Variable Costs**: \( \text{Variable Costs} = (125 + 25)x = 150x \).  
- **Fixed Costs**: \( \text{Fixed Costs} = 3000 \).  
- **Total Costs**: \( \text{Total Costs} = 150x + 3000 \).  

### Step 2: Calculate profit
- **Profit**: \( \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total Costs} = 200x - (150x + 3000) = 50x - 3000 \).  

### Step 3: Set up the equation for desired profit
The desired profit is 10% of sales, which is 10% of total revenue:  
- **Desired Profit**: \( 0.10 \times 200x = 20x \).  

Set the actual profit equal to the desired profit:  
\[
50x - 3000 = 20x
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Subtract \( 20x \) from both sides:  
\[
30x - 3000 = 0
\]

Add \( 3000 \) to both sides:  
\[
30x = 3000
\]

Divide by 30:  
\[
x = 100
\]

### Final Answer
Spark Co. must sell **100 units** to achieve the desired profit of 10% of sales. Among the given options, the correct answer is **J: 100**.
