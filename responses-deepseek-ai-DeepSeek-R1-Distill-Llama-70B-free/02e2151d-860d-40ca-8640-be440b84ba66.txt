Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a tungsten lamp and photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the lamp is 100-W, operates at 1800 K. The question is asking how many photons it emits per second in the wavelength interval from 5000 Angstroms to 5001 Angstroms, using the blackbody approximation. The options are from A to J.

Wait, I remember the blackbody radiation involves Planck's law. Right, the Planck distribution gives the intensity of light emitted at different wavelengths. But photons per second... So I probably need to find the number of photons emitted in that specific wavelength range.

First, I should think about the steps. I think I need to calculate the spectral radiance (the power per unit area per unit wavelength) and then integrate over the given wavelength range, and then convert that into the number of photons.

Wait, but the lamp's total power is given as 100 W. Wait, 100 W is the total power emitted, but blackbody radiation is a function of wavelength, so we have to find the fraction of that power in the specified interval.

But wait, the lamp's operating temperature is 1800 K, and we're looking at a very narrow wavelength range, 5000 to 5001 Angstroms. So that's a 1 Angstrom interval.

Hmm, okay, so first, I think I should calculate the spectral radiance Bλ at 5000 Angstroms, then multiply by the wavelength interval (1 Angstrom) to get the power per unit area, but wait, no. Wait, the lamp is 100 W total, but the problem is in the context of blackbody radiation, so perhaps we can model the lamp as a blackbody radiator.

Wait, but the total power emitted by a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: P = σ * A * T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is the surface area. But wait, the problem doesn't give the surface area of the lamp. Hmm, that could be a problem because without knowing the area, I can't directly compute the spectral radiance. But wait, maybe the question is assuming that the 100 W is the total power, so perhaps the area is somehow accounted for in the calculation. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem expects me to use the power per unit wavelength and then relate that to the number of photons.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by finding the number of photons emitted per second per wavelength interval. So, the number of photons N is equal to the power Pλ (power per wavelength) multiplied by the interval Δλ, divided by the energy per photon E.

Wait, that makes sense. Because each photon has energy E = hc/λ, so the number of photons would be the power in that wavelength range divided by the energy per photon.

But wait, Pλ is the power per unit wavelength, so Pλ multiplied by Δλ gives the total power in that interval. Then, dividing by E gives the number of photons per second.

So, formula-wise, N = (Pλ * Δλ) / (hc/λ) ) = (Pλ * Δλ * λ) / (h c)

So I think that's the approach.

But wait, Pλ is the power per unit wavelength. But the lamp has a total power of 100 W, and the blackbody spectrum tells us how that power is distributed with wavelength. So maybe I can find the fraction of the total power that's in the given wavelength interval, and then calculate the number of photons from that.

Alternatively, the Planck distribution gives the spectral radiance Bλ, which is the power emitted per unit area per unit wavelength per steradian. But then, to get the total power, you have to integrate over all wavelengths and solid angles. But in this problem, perhaps it's easier to work with the distribution function.

Wait, but without knowing the surface area, I'm stuck. Unless the problem assumes that the 100 W is the total power from the blackbody, and we can model the entire emission as coming from a blackbody at 1800 K with a total power of 100 W.

Alternatively, perhaps the Stefan-Boltzmann law can help. The total power P is σ A T^4. So, A = P/(σ T^4). Then, the spectral radiance Bλ is (2 h c^2)/(λ^5) / (e^{hc/(λ k T)} - 1). So the power per unit wavelength would be Bλ multiplied by the area A and integrated over all solid angles, but wait, no, Bλ is already per unit area and per steradian. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let's clarify. The Stefan-Boltzmann law says P = σ A T^4. So A is the surface area. The spectral radiance Bλ is the power per unit area per unit wavelength per steradian. To get the total power at a particular wavelength λ, you would integrate Bλ over all solid angles (which is 4π steradians) and over the area, but wait, no. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the total power per unit wavelength is Pλ = 4 π A Bλ. Because each point on the surface emits into 2π steradians for a blackbody (I think), or is it 4π? Wait, no, no, for a blackbody, the emission is isotropic, so the total power per unit wavelength emitted by the entire area would be Pλ = A * ∫ Bλ dΩ, where dΩ is the solid angle element. Since Bλ is the radiance per steradian, integrating over all solid angles (4π steradians) gives Pλ = 4 π A Bλ.

But I'm not entirely sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is Pλ = 4 π A Bλ, but I might need to double-check that.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way. Since the lamp's total power is given, perhaps the number of photons can be found by finding the fraction of power in the wavelength interval and then using that to compute the number of photons.

So, the Planck distribution in terms of wavelength is given by:

Bλ = (2 h c^2) / (λ^5) ) / ( e^{h c/(λ k T)} - 1 )

But then, the power emitted per unit wavelength is Pλ = Bλ * 4 π A, since Bλ is per unit area and per steradian, and integrating over all solid angles (4π) and area A gives the total power per wavelength.

Wait, but the total power is P = ∫ Pλ dλ from λ=0 to λ=∞, and that equals σ A T^4, according to Stefan-Boltzmann.

But perhaps, for a small wavelength interval, we can approximate Pλ as constant over Δλ, so the power in that interval is approximately Pλ * Δλ.

Thus, the number of photons in that interval would be N = (Pλ * Δλ) / (E_photon) )

And E_photon = h c / λ.

So N = (Pλ * Δλ * λ) / (h c )

But Pλ is 4 π A Bλ, so substituting:

N = (4 π A Bλ * Δλ * λ) / (h c )

But Bλ is given by Planck's law: Bλ = (2 h c^2) / (λ^5 (e^{h c/(λ k T)} - 1)) )

So substituting Bλ:

N = (4 π A * (2 h c^2) / (λ^5 (e^{h c/(λ k T)} - 1) )) * Δλ * λ ) / (h c )

Simplifying, let's see:

N = [4 π A * 2 h c^2 / (λ^5 (e^{x} -1)) ) * Δλ * λ ] / (h c )

Wait, x would be h c / (λ k T)

So let me compute the terms step by step.

First, the numerator:

4 π A * 2 h c^2 = 8 π A h c^2

Denominator: λ^5 (e^{x} -1)

Multiply by Δλ and λ: so Δλ * λ / (λ^5) = Δλ / λ^4

Then, all that is divided by h c.

So putting it together:

N = (8 π A h c^2 * Δλ / (λ^4 (e^{x} -1 )) ) ) / (h c )

Simplify the terms:

h c^2 / (h c) ) = c

So,

N = (8 π A c * Δλ ) / (λ^4 (e^{x} -1) )

Hmm, that seems manageable.

But wait, we can write A from the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Since P = σ A T^4, so A = P / (σ T^4 )

Substituting A into N:

N = (8 π (P/(σ T^4 )) c Δλ ) / (λ^4 (e^{x} -1) )

So,

N = (8 π P c Δλ ) / (σ T^4 λ^4 (e^{x} -1) )

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe manageable.

Let me plug in the numbers.

Given:

P = 100 W

T = 1800 K

Δλ = 1 Angstrom = 1e-10 m (since 1 A = 1e-10 m)

λ = 5000 A = 5000e-10 m = 5e-7 m

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = speed of light = 3e8 m/s

k = Boltzmann constant = 1.38e-23 J/K

σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant = 5.67e-8 W/(m^2 K^4)

Now, let's compute x = h c / (λ k T )

Compute numerator: h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: λ k T = 5e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K * 1800 K

Wait, let me calculate that.

5e-7 m * 1.38e-23 = 6.9e-30, multiplied by 1800 gives 6.9e-30 * 1.8e3 = 1.242e-26 J·m

So x = (1.9878e-25) / (1.242e-26) ≈ 16.0

Wait, wait, let me compute more accurately:

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ k T = 5e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K * 1800 K = 5e-7 * 1.38e-23 * 1.8e3.

Compute step by step:

5e-7 * 1.8e3 = 5 *1.8 =9, exponents: e-7 * e3 = e-4, so 9e-4.

Then 9e-4 * 1.38e-23 = (9*1.38) e-27 = 12.42e-27 = 1.242e-26.

So x = 1.9878e-25 / 1.242e-26 ≈ 16.0

So x ≈ 16.

Compute e^x -1: e^16 is a big number. Let me calculate e^16.

e^10 is about 22026, e^16 = e^10 * e^6 ≈ 22026 * 403.4 ≈ 22026 * 400 = 8,810,400, plus 22026*3.4≈ 74,888.4 → total ≈ 8,885,288.4. So e^16 ≈ 8.89e6, so e^x -1 ≈ 8.89e6.

So e^{x}-1 ≈ 8.89e6.

Now, let's plug all the values into N:

N = (8 π P c Δλ) / (σ T^4 λ^4 (e^x -1) )

Compute each part step by step.

First, compute numerator: 8 * π * P * c * Δλ

P=100, c=3e8, Δλ=1e-10 m.

So 8 * π * 100 * 3e8 * 1e-10.

Compute 8*100 =800; 800 *3e8 =2.4e11; 2.4e11 *1e-10=2.4e1 =24.

Multiply by π: 24 * π ≈75.398.

Denominator: σ T^4 λ^4 (e^x -1 )

Compute each part:

σ =5.67e-8 W/(m² K^4)

T=1800 K, so T^4 = (1800)^4.

Compute 1800^4: 1800^2=3,240,000. So (3.24e6)^2 = approx 1.05e13 (since (3.24)^2=10.4976, so 10.4976e12 =1.04976e13 )

Wait, but more accurately: 1800^4 = (1.8e3)^4 = (1.8)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 10.4976 * 1e12 =1.04976e13.

λ=5e-7 m, so λ^4 = (5e-7)^4 = 625e-28 =6.25e-25 m^4.

So denominator parts:

σ * T^4 =5.67e-8 *1.04976e13 = let's compute that.

5.67e-8 *1e13 =5.67e5, and 5.67e-8 *0.04976e13=5.67e-8 *4.976e11=5.67 *4.976e3 ≈28.35e3=2.835e4.

So total σ*T^4=5.67e5 +2.835e4=5.67e5 +0.2835e5=5.9535e5 ≈5.95e5.

Now multiply by λ^4: 5.95e5 *6.25e-25 = ?

5.95e5 *6.25e-25 = (5.95 *6.25) *1e5 *1e-25 = 37.1875 *1e-20 =3.71875e-19.

Now multiply by (e^x -1)=8.89e6:

Denominator = 3.71875e-19 *8.89e6 = approx 3.71875e-19 *8.89e6 ≈3.71875 *8.89e-13 → 3.71875 *8.89 ≈33.06 → so 33.06e-13 =3.306e-12.

So denominator ≈3.306e-12.

Now numerator is ~75.398.

So N ≈75.398 / 3.306e-12 ≈2.28e13 photons per second.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

75.398 / 3.306e-12 = (75.398 / 3.306) ) * 1e12.

75.398 /3.306 ≈ 22.81.

So 22.81e12 = 2.281e13.

Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 4.9e13

B:9.6e13

C:6.9e13

D:3.5e13

E:7.1e13

F:2.2e13

G:5.8e13

H:4.2e13

I:6.2e13

J:8.4e13

So my calculation gives approx 2.28e13, which is close to option F (2.2e13) or perhaps a bit higher. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Let me check the calculations again for any possible errors.

First, let's recheck the x calculation.

x = h c / (λ k T )

h=6.626e-34, c=3e8, λ=5000A=5e-7 m, k=1.38e-23, T=1800.

Compute numerator:6.626e-34 *3e8=1.9878e-25.

Denominator:5e-7 *1.38e-23 *1800 =5e-7 *1.38e-23 =6.9e-30 → 6.9e-30 *1.8e3=1.242e-26.

So x=1.9878e-25 /1.242e-26 ≈ 16.0.

e^16 is about 8.886e6, so e^x -1≈8.886e6.

Now, the numerator in N: 8π P c Δλ.

P=100 W, c=3e8 m/s, Δλ=1e-10 m.

8π *100 *3e8 *1e-10.

Compute step by step:

8 *100 =800.

800 *3e8=2.4e11.

2.4e11 *1e-10=2.4e1=24.

24 *π≈75.398.

Denominator: σ T^4 λ^4 (e^x-1).

Compute σ=5.67e-8, T=1800 → T^4= (1.8e3)^4=1.8^4 *1e12=10.4976 *1e12=1.04976e13.

Wait, earlier I approximated it as 1.04976e13, correct.

So σ*T^4=5.67e-8 *1.04976e13.

5.67e-8 *1e13=5.67e5.

5.67e-8 *0.04976e13=5.67e-8 *4.976e11=5.67 *4.976e3≈28.2e3=2.82e4.

So σ*T^4=5.67e5 +
