Okay, so I have this question about the money supply and what action would decrease it. Hmm, I remember that the money supply is influenced by the Federal Reserve, the Fed, through various tools. Let me think about each option.

Option A says the Fed lowers the discount rate. Wait, the discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges banks for loans. If they lower it, banks can borrow more cheaply, which might encourage them to borrow more. More loans mean more money in circulation, so that should increase the money supply, not decrease it. So A probably doesn't lead to a decrease.

Option B is the Fed selling government securities in the secondary market. Oh, right, this is part of open market operations. When the Fed sells securities, they're taking money out of the economy. Because when they sell, they receive money from banks, which reduces the banks' reserves. With less reserves, banks can't lend as much, so the money supply decreases. So B seems correct.

Option C is the federal government spending less. If the government spends less, it might reduce demand, but how does that affect the money supply? I'm a bit confused here. The money supply is more about the amount of money in circulation. Government spending affects fiscal policy, but the Fed's monetary policy tools directly affect money supply. So if the government spends less, maybe it reduces the need for borrowing, but I'm not sure if that directly decreases the money supply. Or perhaps it's more about the multiplier effect on the economy rather than the actual money stock. So C might not be the right answer.

Option D is the Fed lowering reserve requirements. Reserve requirements are the percentage of deposits banks must keep as reserves. Lowering them means banks have more to lend. More loans mean more money is created through the banking system, increasing the money supply. So D would actually increase the money supply, not decrease it.

So the correct answer should be B. The Fed selling securities decreases the money supply.

The correct answer is B. When the Fed sells government securities in the secondary market, it removes money from circulation, reducing the reserves of banks and thus decreasing the money supply. 

Answer: B
