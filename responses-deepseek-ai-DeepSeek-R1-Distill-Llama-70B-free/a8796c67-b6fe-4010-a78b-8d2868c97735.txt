Okay, so I've got this matrix problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The matrix given is a 4x5 matrix. The question is asking for the row rank and column rank. I remember that both row and column ranks are equal to the rank of the matrix, which is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. So ideally, the row rank should equal the column rank, but I'm not entirely sure about that. I think they should be the same because rank is a unique property of the matrix, but maybe in some cases they can differ? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

The matrix A is:

1  2   3   4  -3
1  2   0  -5   1
2  4  -3  -19  6
3  6  -3  -24  7

I think the best way to find the rank is to perform row reduction to get it into row-echelon form. That way, I can count the number of non-zero rows, which will give me the row rank. Since the rank is the same for both row and column, that should also be the column rank.

Let me start writing down the matrix:

Row 1: 1  2   3    4   -3
Row 2: 1  2   0   -5    1
Row 3: 2  4  -3  -19    6
Row 4: 3  6  -3  -24    7

First, I'll use Row 1 as the pivot. I'll eliminate the elements below the pivot in the first column.

Row 2: Subtract Row 1 from Row 2:
Row2_new = Row2 - Row1
= (1-1, 2-2, 0-3, -5-4, 1-(-3))
= (0, 0, -3, -9, 4)

Row 3: Subtract 2*Row1 from Row3:
Row3_new = Row3 - 2*Row1
= (2-2*1, 4-2*2, -3-2*3, -19-2*4, 6-2*(-3))
= (0, 0, -3-6= -9, -19-8= -27, 6+6=12)

Row 4: Subtract 3*Row1 from Row4:
Row4_new = Row4 - 3*Row1
= (3-3*1, 6-3*2, -3-3*3, -24-3*4, 7-3*(-3))
= (0, 0, -3-9= -12, -24-12= -36, 7+9=16)

Now the matrix looks like:

Row 1: 1  2   3    4   -3
Row 2: 0  0  -3   -9    4
Row 3: 0  0  -9  -27   12
Row 4: 0  0 -12  -36   16

Next, I'll move to the second column. But since the second element in Row 2 is 0, I'll look at the third column for the pivot. So the pivot is in Row 2, column 3.

To make the pivot 1, I can divide Row 2 by -3. Let's do that:

Row2_scaled = Row2 / (-3)
= (0, 0, 1, 3, -4/3)

But maybe it's better not to use fractions yet. Alternatively, I can use Row 2 as is and eliminate below it.

Looking at Row 3 and Row 4 in column 3, I'll eliminate those elements using Row 2.

Row 3: Row3 is [0,0,-9,-27,12]. I can add 3 times Row2 to Row3 to eliminate the third column.

Row3_new = Row3 + 3 * Row2
= (0+0, 0+0, -9 +3*(-3)= -9-9= -18, -27 +3*(-9)= -27-27= -54, 12 +3*4=12+12=24)

Wait, wait. Wait, Row2 is [0,0,-3,-9,4]. So 3*Row2 would be [0,0,-9,-27,12]. So Row3 + 3*Row2 would be:

[0+0, 0+0, -9 + (-9)= -18, -27 + (-27)= -54, 12 +12=24]

Hmm, so Row3 becomes [0,0,-18,-54,24].

Similarly, for Row4: [0,0,-12,-36,16]. Let's see, to eliminate the third column, we can use Row2.

Row4 has -12 in the third column. Since Row2's third column is -3, the factor would be (-12)/(-3) =4. So we can add 4*Row2 to Row4.

Row4_new = Row4 +4*Row2
= (0+0, 0+0, -12 +4*(-3)= -12-12= -24, -36 +4*(-9)= -36-36= -72, 16 +4*4=16+16=32)

Wait, let me double-check that:

Row4's third column is -12. 4 times Row2's third column is 4*(-3) = -12. So adding that would give -12 + (-12) = -24? Wait, no, because Row4's third column is -12, and 4*Row2's third is -12. So Row4's third would be -12 + (-12) = -24, yes.

So now the matrix becomes:

Row 1: 1  2    3     4    -3
Row 2: 0  0   -3    -9     4
Row 3: 0  0  -18   -54   24
Row 4: 0  0  -24   -72   32

Now, looking at Row 3 and Row 4, I can try to eliminate further. Let's look at Row3: [0,0,-18,-54,24]. Let's factor out a common factor. Maybe factor out 6: -18/6= -3, -54/6= -9, 24/6=4. So Row3 is 6 times [0,0,-3,-9,4], which is the same as 6*Row2. That means Row3 is a multiple of Row2, so it's linearly dependent. So Row3 can be eliminated by subtracting 6*Row2 from Row3, but actually, since it's a multiple, it's already zero after that. Wait, no, let me think. If Row3 is 6 times Row2, then Row3 -6*Row2 would be zero. So that means Row3 is redundant, so we can set it to zero.

Similarly, Row4: [0,0,-24,-72,32]. Let's factor out -24/(-3) would be 8. So 8*Row2 would have third column as -24, fourth as -72, fifth as 32 (since 8*4=32). So Row4 is 8 * Row2. Hence, Row4 -8*Row2 would be zero.

So, after these operations, the matrix would have Row3 and Row4 as zero rows. So the row-echelon form would have two non-zero rows: Row1 and Row2.

Wait, but let me check. So after the previous operations, Row3 becomes zero when we subtract 6*Row2, and Row4 becomes zero when we subtract 8*Row2.

So the updated matrix after these operations would be:

Row1: 1  2    3     4    -3
Row2: 0  0   -3    -9     4
Row3: 0  0    0     0     0
Row4: 0  0    0     0     0

Wait, is that correct? Let me go through the steps again.

Starting from the earlier step:

After eliminating the first column, the matrix is:

Row1: 1 2 3 4 -3
Row2: 0 0 -3 -9 4
Row3: 0 0 -9 -27 12
Row4: 0 0 -12 -36 16

Then, for Row3, I added 3*Row2 to Row3. So Row3 becomes [0,0, (-9) +3*(-3)= -18, (-27)+3*(-9)= -54, 12 +3*4=24].

For Row4, I added 4*Row2 to Row4. So Row4 becomes [0,0, (-12)+4*(-3)= -24, (-36)+4*(-9)= -72, 16+4*4=32].

Now, looking at Row3: [0,0,-18,-54,24]. Let's factor out 6: 6*(0,0,-3,-9,4) which is 6*Row2. So Row3 = 6*Row2. So if I subtract 6*Row2 from Row3, it becomes zero.

Similarly, Row4 is [0,0,-24,-72,32]. That's 8*Row2 (since 8*(-3) = -24, 8*(-9)=-72, 8*4=32). So Row4 is 8*Row2. Subtracting 8*Row2 from Row4 gives zero.

So after these operations, the matrix becomes:

Row1: 1 2 3 4 -3
Row2: 0 0 -3 -9 4
Row3: 0 0 0 0 0
Row4: 0 0 0 0 0

So now, in row-echelon form, there are two non-zero rows. So the row rank is 2.

Wait, but does this mean the column rank is also 2? Because I thought rank is the same for row and column ranks. So the column rank would also be 2.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is [2,2], which would be the case. But looking at the initial matrix, it's a 4x5, so the maximum rank possible is 4, but in this case, it's 2.

Wait, but let me make sure. Maybe I made a mistake in the row operations.

Let me try another approach: computing the determinant or checking for linear independence.

Alternatively, perhaps the rank is 3 because I might have missed something. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps I should have gone further in the row reduction. Let me see.

After getting Row2 as [0,0,-3,-9,4], maybe I should create a leading 1 in the third column.

So, I can divide Row2 by -3 to get:

Row2_scaled: [0, 0, 1, 3, -4/3]

Then use this to eliminate the third column entries in Rows 1, 3, and 4.

Wait, but Rows 3 and 4 are already zero in the third column in the current state, so maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps I should have proceeded differently.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed beyond the initial steps. Let me try to see.

Wait, perhaps I should check for pivot positions beyond the second column.

Wait, the first pivot is at (1,1). The second pivot would be at (2,3) since after the first step, the second row starts with two zeros, and the first non-zero is at column 3.

So the pivot positions are columns 1 and 3. So the rank is 2, because there are two pivots.

So the row rank is 2, and the column rank should also be 2. So the answer should be [2,2], which is option H.

Wait, but let me think again. Because sometimes, when you have more columns, maybe there's another pivot. Let me make sure.

After row reduction, the matrix becomes:

Row 1: 1 2 3 4 -3
Row 2: 0 0 -3 -9 4
Row 3: 0 0 0 0 0
Row 4: 0 0 0 0 0

So there are two non-zero rows, so row rank is 2. Column rank is also 2 because rank is the same for row and column. So the answer should be [2,2], which is option H.

Wait, but looking at the options, H is [2,2], which would be the correct answer. So I think that's it.

To determine the row rank and column rank of the given matrix:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & -3 \\
1 & 2 & 0 & -5 & 1 \\
2 & 4 & -3 & -19 & 6 \\
3 & 6 & -3 & -24 & 7
\end{pmatrix},
$$

we perform row reduction to transform the matrix into row-echelon form. The row-echelon form of a matrix reveals the number of non-zero rows, which corresponds to the row rank. Since the row rank and column rank of a matrix are always equal, this will also give us the column rank.

### Step 1: Eliminate the first column
Using Row 1 as the pivot row:
- Subtract Row 1 from Row 2:  
  $$\text{Row2\_new} = \text{Row2} - \text{Row1} = [0, 0, -3, -9, 4].$$
- Subtract 2 times Row 1 from Row 3:  
  $$\text{Row3\_new} = \text{Row3} - 2 \cdot \text{Row1} = [0, 0, -9, -27, 12].$$
- Subtract 3 times Row 1 from Row 4:  
  $$\text{Row4\_new} = \text{Row4} - 3 \cdot \text{Row1} = [0, 0, -12, -36, 16].$$

The matrix becomes:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & -3 \\
0 & 0 & -3 & -9 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & -9 & -27 & 12 \\
0 & 0 & -12 & -36 & 16
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

### Step 2: Eliminate the third column
Using Row 2 as the pivot row:
- Add 3 times Row 2 to Row 3:  
  $$\text{Row3\_new} = \text{Row3} + 3 \cdot \text{Row2} = [0, 0, 0, 0, 24].$$
- Add 4 times Row 2 to Row 4:  
  $$\text{Row4\_new} = \text{Row4} + 4 \cdot \text{Row2} = [0, 0, 0, 0, 32].$$

The matrix becomes:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & -3 \\
0 & 0 & -3 & -9 & 4 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 24 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 32
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

### Step 3: Analyze the row-echelon form
The matrix now has two non-zero rows (Row 1 and Row 2). Therefore, the row rank is 2. Since the row rank and column rank are always equal, the column rank is also 2.

### Final Answer
The row rank and column rank of the matrix are both 2. Thus, the answer is:

**[2, 2]**
