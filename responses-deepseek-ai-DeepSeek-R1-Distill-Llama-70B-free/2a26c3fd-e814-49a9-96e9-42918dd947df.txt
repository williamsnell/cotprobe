Question:

A march was held to call attention to the fact that minorities are still disenfranchised from the electoral process. A congressional report revealed that in the certain parts of the country, only 42% of minorities eligible to vote were, in fact, registered.

As a consequence, Congress enacted a statute that makes any law denying minorities the right to vote shall be deemed unconstitutional. This federal statute will most likely be upheld under which of the following constitutional provisions?

Options:

A: Twenty-sixth Amendment.
B: Tenth Amendment.
C: Eighth Amendment.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically relating to voting rights and congressional statutes. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question is about a march that brought attention to minorities being disenfranchised. A congressional report found that only 42% of eligible minorities were registered, and some states had residency laws restricting voting. Congress then passed a statute declaring any law denying minorities the right to vote as unconstitutional. The question is asking under which constitutional provision this statute will most likely be upheld.

First, I need to recall the constitutional amendments related to voting rights. I remember that the 15th Amendment deals with race and voting. The 15th Amendment says that the right to vote cannot be denied based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. It gives Congress the power to enforce this by legislation.

Wait, but there's also the 14th Amendment, which deals with equal protection under the law. And the 26th Amendment is about age, right? It says you can't deny voting based on age if you're 18 or older. The 19th Amendment is about sex, ensuring women can vote. 

The question mentions that states have residency laws that restrict voting. Residency requirements could be seen as a barrier, particularly affecting minorities. So Congress is stepping in to say such laws are unconstitutional.

So the statute is making state laws that deny minorities the right to vote unconstitutional. Which part of the Constitution gives Congress this authority?

I think the 15th Amendment is the key here. Because it specifically addresses race and voting rights, and it gives Congress enforcement power. Section 2 of the 15th Amendment allows Congress to pass laws to enforce the prohibition against racial discrimination in voting.

But wait, could it also relate to the 14th Amendment? The 14th's Section 5 gives Congress power to enforce equal protection, which includes voting rights. So maybe both 14th and 15th are relevant.

But the question is about denying minorities the right to vote, which is more directly tied to race. So the 15th Amendment would be the basis for Congress's action. 

Looking at the options, option J is the 15th Amendment. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. The 15th Amendment was about ensuring freed slaves could vote, right? And it's been used in cases to strike down discriminatory voting laws based on race.

Alternatively, the 14th Amendment's Section 5 is about enforcing the amendment, which includes voting rights. So if a state law violates the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause by disenfranchising minorities, Congress can enact legislation under Section 5.

But the question here is about minorities being disenfranchised, so race is the factor. The 15th Amendment directly prohibits denying the vote based on race, so Congress's statute would be based on their power under the 15th Amendment.

Therefore, the correct answer should be J: Fifteenth Amendment.

The question revolves around a congressional statute aimed at combating the disenfranchisement of minorities, specifically addressing state laws that restrict voting rights based on race. The 15th Amendment explicitly prohibits the denial of voting rights on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude and grants Congress the authority to enforce this prohibition through legislation. While the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause is also relevant, the statute's focus on race-based disenfranchisement aligns most directly with the 15th Amendment's provisions. Therefore, the statute will most likely be upheld under the Fifteenth Amendment.

Answer: J
