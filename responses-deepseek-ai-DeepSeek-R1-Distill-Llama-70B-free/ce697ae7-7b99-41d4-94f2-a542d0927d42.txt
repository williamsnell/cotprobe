Okay, so I need to figure out how to classify the sentence "Every day was a happy day, and every night was peaceful." The options are A through I, each representing different sentence types. Let me start by recalling what each of these terms mean.

First, I remember that sentences can be classified based on their structure and purpose. The main categories are simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex. Then there are the declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory sentences, which are more about the sentence's purpose or mood.

Looking at the given sentence, it's a declarative sentence because it's making a statement. So I can probably rule out options A (interrogative, which is a question), D (imperative, which gives a command), and F (exclamatory, which expresses strong emotion).

Now, focusing on the structure. The sentence has two independent clauses connected by a conjunction. The clauses are "Every day was a happy day" and "every night was peaceful." Each has a subject and a predicate, so they're both independent. They're joined by "and," which is a coordinating conjunction.

Since there are two independent clauses joined by a conjunction, this makes a compound sentence. A compound sentence is made up of two or more independent clauses with no dependent clauses. There's no subordinating conjunction here, so it's not complex or compound-complex.

Wait, but the options are specific. Let me check the options again. Option G is "compound," which would fit if it's a compound sentence. Option E is "compound-simple," which I'm not as familiar with. I think "compound-simple" isn't a standard term. Typically, it's either compound, simple, complex, or compound-complex.

Wait, perhaps the options are using a different terminology. Let me think again. The sentence has two independent clauses, so it's compound. But what about the structure of each clause? Each is a simple sentence because each has a single subject and predicate without any additional clauses or structures. So the entire sentence is a compound sentence made up of two simple clauses. So the term would be "compound-simple," but I'm not sure if that's an option.

Looking back at the options, E is "compound-simple." Hmm, but more commonly, it's just called a compound sentence. Because the two independent clauses make it compound, regardless of each being simple. So perhaps the correct classification is "compound." But I'm a bit confused because the options include E as "compound-simple."

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me clarify. The structure is:

- Two independent clauses (each simple) connected by a coordinating conjunction. So the overall sentence is compound. Therefore, it's a compound sentence, which would be option G.

But wait, looking at the options again, option E is "compound-simple," and option G is "compound." So which is correct? I'm a bit torn because sometimes people describe a compound sentence as consisting of two simple sentences. So perhaps the term used here is "compound-simple," making E the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is G, "compound," because that's the standard term. I'm a bit unsure. Let me think of definitions.

A simple sentence has one independent clause. A compound sentence has two or more independent clauses joined by a conjunction, semicolon, or colon, with no dependent clauses. So this sentence fits that. Therefore, the correct classification is "compound," which is option G.

Wait, but the options also have "compound-simple" as E. Maybe "compound-simple" is another way to say it's a compound sentence made of simple sentences. But I'm not certain if that's a standard classification. I think the more standard term is "compound," so option G would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the overall structure. Since each clause is simple, and together they form a compound structure, maybe the answer is E: compound-simple. But I'm not sure if that's a standard term or just a distractor.

I think I need to go with the standard classification. The sentence is a compound sentence because it contains two independent clauses. So the answer should be G: compound.

The sentence "Every day was a happy day, and every night was peaceful" is best classified as a compound sentence. It consists of two independent clauses ("Every day was a happy day" and "every night was peaceful") joined by the coordinating conjunction "and." There are no dependent clauses, making it a compound sentence rather than a complex or compound-complex sentence. While the term "compound-simple" might suggest a compound sentence composed of simple clauses, the standard classification is "compound." Therefore, the correct answer is:

G
