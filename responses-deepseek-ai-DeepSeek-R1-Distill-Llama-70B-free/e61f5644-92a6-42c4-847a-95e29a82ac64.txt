Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the effect of concentration changes on the number of collisions between reactants A and B in a chemical reaction. The reaction is A + B → C + D. The question asks two parts: part (a) is when the concentration of each is tripled, and part (b) is when each is quadrupled. I need to find out how these changes affect the number of collisions.

Hmm, I remember that the rate of a reaction is related to the number of collisions between the reactant molecules. The collision theory says that for a reaction to occur, the molecules must collide with sufficient energy and proper orientation. But how does concentration affect this?

Wait, concentration is a measure of how many particles are in a given volume. So if the concentration of each reactant increases, the number of particles per unit volume increases. More particles around means more frequent collisions between them.

I think the number of collisions is proportional to the product of the concentrations of A and B. Because each molecule of A can collide with each molecule of B. So if [A] is the concentration of A, and [B] is the concentration of B, the collision rate (number of collisions per unit time) should be proportional to [A][B].

So the initial situation is when [A] and [B] are at some initial concentrations, say [A]₀ and [B]₀. The initial number of collisions would be proportional to [A]₀ * [B]₀.

Now, for part (a), both concentrations are tripled. So new [A] is 3[A]₀, and new [B] is 3[B]₀. The new number of collisions is proportional to (3[A]₀) * (3[B]₀) = 9 [A]₀[B]₀. So the number of collisions increases by 9 times.

Similarly, for part (b), both concentrations are quadrupled. New concentrations are 4[A]₀ and 4[B]₀. The product is 4 * 4 = 16 times the original product. So collisions increase by 16 times.

Looking at the options, I need to find an option where (a) is 9 times and (b) is 16 times. Let's scan the options.

Option D says 9 times and 16 times. That's exactly what I found. Option A is 18 and 32, which is 3^2*2 and 4^2*2, but that doesn't fit. Option D seems right.

I should make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me think again. The number of collisions depends on both concentrations because each molecule of A can collide with each B. So it's a product. Tripling each leads to 3*3=9 times the collisions. Quadrupling each gives 4*4=16. Yep, so D is correct.

The number of collisions between reactants A and B in the reaction A + B → C + D is proportional to the product of their concentrations, [A][B]. 

- **Part (a):** When the concentration of each reactant is tripled, the new concentrations are 3[A]₀ and 3[B]₀. The number of collisions becomes proportional to (3[A]₀)(3[B]₀) = 9[A]₀[B]₀, which is 9 times the original number of collisions.  
- **Part (b):** When the concentration of each reactant is quadrupled, the new concentrations are 4[A]₀ and 4[B]₀. The number of collisions becomes proportional to (4[A]₀)(4[B]₀) = 16[A]₀[B]₀, which is 16 times the original number of collisions.

Thus, the effect of tripling the concentrations results in 9 times more collisions, and quadrupling the concentrations results in 16 times more collisions. The correct answer is:

D: 9 times and 16 times.
