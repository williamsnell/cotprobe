Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the mass difference between the final and initial nuclei when a gamma ray is emitted. Hmm, I remember that when a nucleus undergoes a transition from an excited state to a ground state, it emits a gamma photon, and this process involves a mass defect because energy is released.

Wait, the mass defect is related to the energy through Einstein's equation, E=mc². So the energy released should correspond to the mass lost. But wait, since the excited state is higher in energy, and it's moving to a lower energy state, the mass of the system must decrease because energy is being emitted as the gamma ray.

The problem says that the initial nucleus is (^19_8O)*, the excited state, and it transitions to (^19_8O) in the ground state plus a gamma ray. The energy change given is ΔE = 1.06 × 10^8 kcal/mole. Oh wait, that's a huge number. But wait, what's the sign here? Since the system is losing energy (emitting), the energy of the system decreases, so the mass should decrease as well. So Δm would be negative because the mass after is less than before.

But wait, units are in grams per mole. So I need to convert the energy from kcal to joules probably, and then use E=mc² to find the mass difference.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Convert the energy from kcal/mole to joules.
2. Use E=Δm c² to find Δm.
3. Make sure the units are in grams per mole.

Wait, right. 1 kilocalorie (kcal) is 4184 joules. So 1.06e8 kcal is 1.06e8 * 4184 J.

Wait, but energy is given as per mole. So per mole of transitions? So per mole, the energy released is that.

So let's compute ΔE in joules:

ΔE = 1.06e8 kcal/mol * 4184 J/kcal = 1.06e8 *4.184e3 = Let me calculate that.

1.06e8 is 1.06 * 10^8. Multiply by 4.184e3:

1.06 * 4.184 = approximately 4.432 (exact would be 1.06 *4=4.24, 1.06*0.184=0.195, total ~4.435) → so 4.435e11 J/mol.

Wait, wait, 1e8 * 1e3 is 1e11, so yeah, 4.435e11 J/mol.

E=mc² → m= E/(c²).

c is speed of light, about 3e8 m/s. c squared is 9e16 m²/s².

So m= E/(c²) = (4.435e11 J/mol) / (9e16 m²/s²) → J is kg·m²/s², so J/(m²/s²) → kg.

Wait, so 4.435e11 / 9e16 → 4.435/(9e5) → let's compute that.

4.435 /9 = ~0.4928. So 0.4928e-5 kg/mol.

Wait, 0.4928e-5 kg is equal to 4.928e-6 kg/mol. Because 1 kg is 1e3 grams, so 4.928e-6 kg is 4.928e-3 grams. Wait, no:

Wait, 0.4928e-5 kg is 4.928e-6 kg. To convert kg to grams, multiply by 1e3: 4.928e-3 grams. So 4.928e-3 g/mol.

Wait, but wait, if the mass is lost, then Δm is negative. Because the initial mass (excited state) is higher than the final (ground plus photon). So the change in mass is initial minus final: m_initial - m_final = mass defect, which is positive, but here the emitted gamma is energy leaving, so the mass decrease is positive, but the problem is asking for the difference in mass between final and initial, which is m_final - m_initial. So that would be negative.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The question says: "Calculate Δm, the difference in mass between the final and initial nuclei". So Δm = m_final - m_initial.

But since the system loses mass (because energy is emitted), m_final is less than m_initial, so Δm is negative.

Wait, but wait, when the nucleus emits a gamma ray, the mass of the system (nucleus + gamma) is considered. Hmm, but actually, the gamma is energy, so the mass is the rest mass of the nucleus after, and the gamma is energy. But in reality, the mass of the system (nucleus plus photon) would have the same rest mass as before, but that's probably not the case here. Wait, no, because the photon has energy but no rest mass. So the initial nucleus has higher rest mass, and after emitting the photon, the rest mass is lower, because the photon carries away energy. So the rest mass of the nucleus decreases, and the energy of the photon comes from that loss.

Wait, so the initial mass (excited nucleus) is m_initial, and the final is m_final (ground nucleus) plus the energy of the photon. But when considering the mass of the nucleus, the energy carried away by the photon corresponds to the mass difference via E=Δm c². So the mass of the final nucleus is m_final = m_initial - Δm, and the energy of the photon is Δm c². So the total mass after is m_final (ground nucleus) plus the photon's energy, but photons don't contribute to rest mass. So the system's rest mass is m_final, and the photon is just energy.

But for the purpose of this calculation, the energy of the photon (ΔE) equals the mass defect (Δm) times c². So Δm = m_initial - m_final = ΔE/(c²). But since the question is asking for Δm = m_final - m_initial, that would be negative.

So in this case, the mass difference Δm is negative, as m_final < m_initial.

So putting it all together:

ΔE = 1.06e8 kcal/mol * 4184 J/kcal = 1.06e8 *4.184e3 = 4.435e11 J/mol.

Δm = ΔE/(c²) → 4.435e11 J/mol / (9e16 m²/s²) = 4.435e11 /9e16 kg/mol → 4.435/(9e5) → approximately 4.928e-6 kg/mol → 4.928e-3 g/mol.

But since Δm is m_final - m_initial, it's negative. So Δm = -4.928e-3 g/mol.

Looking at the options:

Option G is -4.92 × 10^-3 g/mole.

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 1.06e8 kcal/mol * 4184 J/kcal = 1.06e8 *4.184e3 = let me compute that more accurately.

1.06e8 is 106,000,000.

Multiply by 4184:

106,000,000 * 4184 = let's compute.

106e6 *4.184e3 = 106 *4.184 *1e9 = (106 *4.184) = let's compute 100*4.184=418.4, 6*4.184=25.104 → sum is 443.504 → 443.504e9 J/mol → 4.43504e11 J/mol.

Then, E = 4.43504e11 J/mol.

c squared is (3e8)^2 =9e16 m²/s².

Δm = E/(c²) = 4.43504e11 /9e16 = (4.43504 /9) *1e-5 kg/mol.

4.43504 /9 → 0.4928 approximately.

So 0.4928e-5 kg/mol → 4.928e-6 kg/mol → 4.928e-3 grams/mol.

But since the problem asks for mass difference, m_final - m_initial is negative. So Δm = -4.928e-3 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option G is -4.92e-3 g/mole. So that's the correct answer.

To calculate Δm, the difference in mass between the final and initial nuclei in grams per mole for the emission of a γ ray, we use the relationship derived from Einstein's equation:  

\[
E = \Delta m \cdot c^2
\]

### Step 1: Convert energy from kcal/mol to joules
The energy released is given as \( \Delta E = 1.06 \times 10^8 \, \text{kcal/mol} \). Converting to joules:  

\[
1 \, \text{kcal} = 4184 \, \text{J}, \quad \Delta E = 1.06 \times 10^8 \cdot 4184 = 4.435 \times 10^{11} \, \text{J/mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the mass difference
Rearranging the equation \( E = \Delta m \cdot c^2 \) to solve for \( \Delta m \):  

\[
\Delta m = \frac{\Delta E}{c^2},
\]

where \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light, so \( c^2 = 9.00 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2 \). Substituting the values:  

\[
\Delta m = \frac{4.435 \times 10^{11}}{9.00 \times 10^{16}} = 4.928 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{kg/mol}.
\]

Convert to grams:  

\[
\Delta m = 4.928 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the sign of Δm
The problem asks for \( \Delta m \), the difference in mass between the final and initial nuclei. Since the initial nucleus (excited state) has a higher mass than the final nucleus (ground state), \( \Delta m = m_{\text{final}} - m_{\text{initial}} \) is negative. Thus:  

\[
\Delta m = -4.928 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The closest option to the calculated value is:  

**G: -4.92 × 10⁻³ g/mole.**
