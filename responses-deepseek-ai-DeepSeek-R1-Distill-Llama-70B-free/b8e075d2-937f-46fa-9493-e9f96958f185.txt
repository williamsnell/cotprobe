Question:

A woman owned land in fee simple absolute. The woman conveyed the land to a friend "for life," and when the friend died the land was to go to the woman's neighbor "and her heirs." The neighbor died and in her duly probated will devised her entire estate to a local charity. If she had died intestate, her daughter would have been her only heir. One year after the neighbor died, her daughter executed a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she might have in the land to the woman's friend. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. There are no other applicable statutes. Who has what interest in the land?

Options:

A: The friend has a life estate and the woman has a reversion, because the neighbor's remainder was void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.
B: The friend has a fee simple absolute, because his life estate merged with the remainder conveyed to him by the daughter.
C: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable and her will transferred her entire estate.
D: The friend has a fee simple absolute, because the quitclaim deed from the daughter transferred any interest she might have had in the land.
E: The friend has a life estate and the daughter has a contingent remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor's heirs.
F: The friend has a life estate and the daughter has a vested remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor's heirs.
G: The friend has a life estate and the woman's neighbor has a vested remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor.
H: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.
I: The friend has a life estate and the local charity has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's will transferred her entire estate.
J: The friend has a life estate and the woman's neighbor has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's will devised her entire estate to a local charity.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here about the Rule Against Perpetuities and future interests. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read through the question again carefully.

So, a woman owns land in fee simple absolute. She conveys it to her friend "for life," and when the friend dies, it's supposed to go to her neighbor "and her heirs." Then, the neighbor died and left her entire estate to a local charity in her will. If she had died intestate, her daughter would have been her only heir. A year after the neighbor died, the daughter executed a quitclaim deed to the friend, conveying any interest she might have had. The jurisdiction follows the common law Rule Against Perpetuities without any modifications or other statutes.

The question is, who has what interest in the land now?

Alright, let's break this down. The woman conveyed the land to her friend for life. So, that's a life estate to the friend. Then, the remainder is to the neighbor and her heirs. Wait, when you grant to someone and their heirs, that typically creates a fee simple absolute. So, the neighbor was supposed to get a fee simple absolute after the friend's life estate ends.

But the neighbor died before the friend. Oh, wait, no, the friend is still alive because the conveyance is for the friend's life. So the neighbor died, but the friend is still alive. So, the remainder to the neighbor... but the neighbor died, so what happens to her interest?

Wait, the neighbor died after the conveyance but before the friend. The neighbor's will left everything to charity. So, the neighbor had a vested remainder in fee simple absolute. Because at the time the woman created the life estate and the remainder, the neighbor was ascertained, and her interest wasn't subject to a condition. So it's a vested remainder, which is transferable and devisable.

So when the neighbor died, she could pass her vested remainder to her estate. Her will says she left everything to charity. So the charity gets the vested remainder. So after the friend dies, the land should go to the charity.

But wait, the daughter of the neighbor executed a quitclaim deed to the friend a year after the neighbor died. So the daughter is conveying any interest she might have. But under intestacy, the daughter would have been the heir. But the neighbor died testate, leaving everything to charity, so the daughter didn't inherit anything from the neighbor. So the daughter's quitclaim deed probably doesn't transfer anything because she didn't have any interest. Unless... perhaps the Rule Against Perpetuities affects this.

Wait, let me think again. The original conveyance was to the friend for life, then to the neighbor and her heirs. So the neighbor has a vested remainder in fee simple. But under the Rule Against Perpetuities, any contingent interest must vest, if at all, within 21 years after the death of a life in being at the time of the conveyance. So, when the woman created the life estate to the friend, and a remainder to the neighbor and her heirs, the neighbor is a life in being. So the remainder is to the neighbor, but does it create any issues?

Wait, no, because the remainder to the neighbor is a vested remainder. It's a present interest; she's ascertained, and there's no condition. So the Rule Against Perpetuities isn't violated here because the vested remainder is going to take effect immediately upon the friend's death, and the friend is a life in being. So the neighbor's interest is fine.

So when the neighbor died, her vested remainder passed to her estate, which she devised to the charity. So the charity now holds that vested remainder.

So the current interests are: the friend has a life estate, and the charity has a vested remainder in fee simple absolute.

Looking at the answer options:

Option H says the friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder. That fits.

Option C says the friend has a life estate and the charity has a contingent remainder. No, because the remainder was vested, so it's not contingent.

Option I says the charity has a contingent remainder. Again, no, it's vested.

Option A suggests the neighbor's remainder was void under RAP, but that's not the case here because the remainder was vested and not subject to RAP issues.

Option B says the friend has fee simple because of merger. But the remainder is in the charity now, so the friend's life estate doesn't merge with a remainder he might have bought. Wait, the daughter's quitclaim deed to the friend: does that affect anything? The daughter had no interest because the neighbor left everything to charity. So the daughter didn't own any part of the remainder. So the quitclaim deed from daughter to friend doesn't transfer anything. So the remainder is still with the charity.

Therefore, the correct answer is H.

The woman conveyed the land to her friend for life, creating a life estate in the friend. The remainder was granted to the neighbor "and her heirs," which constitutes a vested remainder in fee simple absolute. The neighbor, as a life in being at the time of the conveyance, ensured that her vested remainder was not subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities. When the neighbor died, her vested remainder passed to her estate, which she devised to the local charity through her will. 

The daughter's quitclaim deed to the friend a year after the neighbor's death does not affect the outcome because the daughter had no interest in the land. Under the neighbor's will, the charity inherited the vested remainder, and the daughter would only have had an interest if the neighbor had died intestate, which she did not.

Thus, the friend holds a life estate, and the charity holds a vested remainder in fee simple absolute. 

The correct answer is:

H: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.

Answer: H
