Question:

The relationship introduced in Problem $1-48$ has been interpreted to mean that a particle of mass $m\left(E=m c^2\right)$ can materialize from nothing provided that it returns to nothing within a time $\Delta t \leq h / m c^2$. Particles that last for time $\Delta t$ or more are called real particles; particles that last less than time $\Delta t$ are called virtual particles. The mass of the charged pion, a subatomic particle, is $2.5 \times 10^{-28} \mathrm{~kg}$. What is the minimum lifetime if the pion is to be considered a real particle?

Options:

A: 2.0 x 10^-23 s
B:  2.9$10^{-23} \mathrm{~s}$ 
C: 3.0 x 10^-22 s
D: 2.5$10^{-23} \mathrm{~s}$
E: 1.2 x 10^-23 s
F: 3.2$10^{-23} \mathrm{~s}$
G: 4.1 x 10^-23 s
H: 3.7$10^{-23} \mathrm{~s}$
I: 5.0 x 10^-23 s
J: 1.5 x 10^-23 s

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the minimum lifetime of a charged pion to be considered a real particle. Hmm, I remember from my notes that real particles are those that last longer than a certain time, which is determined by their mass. The key formula mentioned earlier was something like delta t being less than or equal to h over (m c squared). Oh wait, right! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The relation is Δt ≤ h/(m c²), where h is Planck's constant.

So the pion's mass is given as 2.5e-28 kg. I need to calculate the minimum lifetime, which would be when it's exactly at the threshold of being real—so when Δt equals h/(m c²).

Wait, what's the value of Planck's constant h? Oh right, h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. And the speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s.

Let me plug the numbers in. So the formula becomes Δt = h/(m c²). 

Calculating the denominator first: m is 2.5e-28 kg, c squared is (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s². So m c² is 2.5e-28 kg * 9e16 m²/s². Let me compute that: 2.5 * 9 is 22.5, and 10^-28 * 10^16 is 10^-12. So m c² is 22.5e-12 J.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so that makes sense.

Now, h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So Δt = (6.626e-34) / (22.5e-12). Let me compute that division.

6.626e-34 divided by 22.5e-12 equals (6.626 / 22.5) multiplied by 1e-22. Because 10^-34 divided by 10^-12 is 10^(-34+12) = 10^-22.

Calculating 6.626 / 22.5. Let's see: 22.5 times 0.29 is 6.525. Because 22.5 * 0.3 would be 6.75, which is a bit higher than 6.626. So 0.29 is about 6.525. The difference is 6.626 - 6.525 = 0.101. So 0.101/22.5 is about 0.0045. So approximately 0.2945. So roughly 0.2945e-22 seconds.

Wait, wait. Oh no, no, because 6.626e-34 divided by 22.5e-12 is (6.626 / 22.5) * 10^(-34+12) which is 10^-22. So 6.626 /22.5 is approximately 0.2944, so 0.2944e-22 seconds. But wait, 0.2944e-22 is the same as 2.944e-23 seconds.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.9e-23 s, which matches. Hmm, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recompute 6.626 / 22.5. 22.5 times 0.29 is 6.525. 22.5 * 0.294 is 22.5*(0.29 +0.004)=6.525 + 0.09=6.615. Oh, that's really close to 6.626. So 0.294 gives 6.615, the target is 6.626. The difference is 6.626 -6.615=0.011. So 0.011 /22.5 is about 0.000489. So 0.294 + 0.000489 is approximately 0.2945. So 0.2945e-22 s, which is 2.945e-23 s. So yeah, approximately 2.9e-23 s.

Wait, but option B is 2.9e-23, which would be the answer. But let me check the options again. Oh, wait, option B is 2.9x10^-23 s.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Oh wait, the formula is delta t = h/(m c²). Did I get that right? Yes, because the problem states that the pion is considered real if its lifetime is longer than delta t, so the minimum is when delta t equals h/(m c²). So that's correct.

So the calculation steps are correct. So the answer should be option B, 2.9e-23 seconds.

To determine the minimum lifetime of a charged pion to be considered a real particle, we use the relationship derived from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta t \leq \frac{h}{m c^2}
\]

Here:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( m = 2.5 \times 10^{-28} \, \mathrm{kg} \) (mass of the charged pion),
- \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{m/s} \) (speed of light).

First, calculate \( m c^2 \):
\[
m c^2 = (2.5 \times 10^{-28}) \cdot (3.0 \times 10^8)^2 = 2.5 \times 10^{-28} \cdot 9 \times 10^{16} = 22.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{J}.
\]

Next, calculate \( \Delta t \):
\[
\Delta t = \frac{h}{m c^2} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{22.5 \times 10^{-12}}.
\]

Perform the division:
\[
\frac{6.626}{22.5} \approx 0.2944, \quad \text{and} \quad 10^{-34} / 10^{-12} = 10^{-22}.
\]

Thus:
\[
\Delta t \approx 0.2944 \times 10^{-22} = 2.944 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{s}.
\]

Rounding to two significant figures gives:
\[
\Delta t \approx 2.9 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{s}.
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B: \( 2.9 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{s} \)**.
