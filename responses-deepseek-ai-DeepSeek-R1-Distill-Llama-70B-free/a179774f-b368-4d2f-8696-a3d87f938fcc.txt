Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out which expression is equivalent to 5 times (6x plus 3y). Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, I remember that when you have something like 5 multiplied by a parenthesis, it means you have to distribute the 5 to both terms inside the parentheses. So that's the distributive property, right? Like, a(b + c) equals ab plus ac.

So the original expression is 5(6x + 3y). I need to distribute the 5 to both 6x and 3y. Let's do that. 

5 multiplied by 6x — okay, 5 times 6 is 30, so that gives 30x. Then, 5 multiplied by 3y. 5 times 3 is 15, so that's 15y. 

Putting those together, after distributing, the expression becomes 30x plus 15y. Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches this.

Looking at the options: 

Option A is 11x + 3y. Wait, that doesn't fit because our x term is 30x, not 11, and the y term here is only 3y, not 15. So A is out.

Option B is 11x + 8y. Again, 11 doesn't match 30, and 8 doesn't match 15. So B isn't right either.

Option C is 30x + 3y. Oh, the x part matches, but the y part is 3 instead of 15. So C is incorrect.

Option D is 30x + 15y. Oh yeah, that's exactly what I got after distributing. So D must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I multiply correctly? 5 times 6x is indeed 30x. And 5 times 3y is 15y. Yep, that's right. So when I combine them, it's 30x +15y, which is option D. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's pretty straightforward. Just apply the distributive property correctly, and you get the right answer.

The expression 5(6x + 3y) can be simplified using the distributive property, which states that \( a(b + c) = ab + ac \). Applying this:

\[
5(6x + 3y) = 5 \cdot 6x + 5 \cdot 3y = 30x + 15y
\]

Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A:** \( 11x + 3y \) — Incorrect, as the coefficients do not match.
- **Option B:** \( 11x + 8y \) — Incorrect, as the coefficients do not match.
- **Option C:** \( 30x + 3y \) — Incorrect, as the coefficient of \( y \) does not match.
- **Option D:** \( 30x + 15y \) — Correct, as it matches the simplified expression.

Thus, the correct answer is:

D
