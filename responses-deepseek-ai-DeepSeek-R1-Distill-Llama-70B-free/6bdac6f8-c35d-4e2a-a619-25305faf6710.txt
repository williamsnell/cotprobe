Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which option is NOT a defining feature of postcolonialism in security studies. I'm a bit new to this topic, so I'll need to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that postcolonialism is a critical theory that examines the impact of colonialism on societies and their security. So it probably looks at things like the legacy of colonialism, power imbalances, and cultural factors.

Looking at the options one by one:

Option A: Postcolonialism focuses on economic factors. I think other perspectives, like realism or liberalism, also consider economics. But does postcolonialism focus on it primarily? Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's a defining feature. I'll keep this in mind.

Option B: It's not a European form of knowledge. That makes sense because postcolonialism often comes from non-Western scholars, so this is a defining feature. So B is a feature, not the answer.

Option C: Doesn't consider colonial history. Wait, that seems wrong. Postcolonialism is all about how colonial history affects current issues. So if this option says it doesn't consider that, then it's not a feature. So C could be the answer because it's the opposite of what postcolonialism does.

Option D: Doesn't consider global inequality. Hmm, postcolonialism does focus on inequalities, especially those stemming from colonialism. So D would be incorrect as a feature, making it a possible answer. Wait, but the question is about which is NOT a defining feature. So if it's not considering inequality, that's not a feature, so D could be the answer. But I'm a bit confused because I think postcolonialism does consider inequality.

Option E: Considers nation or community as a referent. I think postcolonialism does look at various groups, not just states. So E is a feature, not the answer.

Option F: Focus on violence. I recall that postcolonialism discusses how violence was used in colonialism, so F is a feature.

Option G: Bilateral vs multilateral. I'm not sure. Maybe postcolonialism looks at broader structures rather than just bilateral issues. So G might not be a feature, but I'm not certain.

Option H: Disregards cultural factors. No, postcolonialism definitely considers culture, so H is not a feature, making it a possible answer.

Option I: Considers small wars. Yes, postcolonialism looks at asymmetric conflicts, so I is a feature.

Now, let me think again. The question asks which is NOT a defining feature.

So, the features that are true of postcolonialism would include considering colonial history, global inequality, culture, small wars, violence, and non-European perspectives. The ones that are false would be the options that say they don't consider these things.

Looking at the options:

C says postcolonialism doesn't consider colonial history. That's wrong because it does, so C is NOT a feature.

D says it doesn't consider inequality. I think postcolonialism does, so D is not a feature.

H says it disregards culture. No, it considers it, so H is not a feature.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a defining feature. So the correct answer is the option that is false about postcolonialism.

So which of these options is something that postcolonialism does NOT do.

Wait, the question is phrased as which is NOT a defining feature. So the incorrect statement about postcolonialism is the answer.

So let's list each option as true or false about postcolonialism.

A: Focus on economic factors. I'm not sure. Maybe it's part of it, but is it a primary focus? I think other theories focus more on economics, like Marxism. So maybe A is not a defining feature. Or perhaps postcolonialism does consider economic factors as part of colonial legacy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of what postcolonialism focuses on. It emphasizes the impact of colonialism on identities, cultures, and power structures. It's critical of Eurocentric views and looks at how colonial histories shape current security issues, including inequality and cultural factors.

So, looking back:

Option C: Doesn't consider colonial history. That's incorrect, so C is NOT a feature.

Option D: Doesn't consider inequality. That's also incorrect, so D is NOT a feature.

Option H: Disregards culture. That's wrong, so H is NOT a feature.

Wait, but the question is about which is NOT a defining feature. So the correct answer is the one that postcolonialism does NOT have.

Wait, the options are phrased as "which is NOT a defining feature", meaning the incorrect statement about postcolonialism.

So for example, if an option says postcolonialism doesn't consider something that it actually does, then that's the answer.

So the correct answer would be the option that incorrectly describes postcolonialism.

So looking again:

Option C: Postcolonialism doesn't consider colonial history. That's false. So this is NOT a feature.

Similarly, Option D: Doesn't consider inequality. Also false.

Option H: Disregards culture. Also false.

Wait, but the question is which one is NOT a defining feature. So the correct answer is the statement that is false about postcolonialism.

So the answer would be the option that is not true.

So in the options, C, D, H are false statements about postcolonialism. But the question is which is NOT a defining feature, meaning which is not something that defines it.

Wait, the question is phrased as which of the following is NOT a defining feature. So for example, if an option says something that postcolonialism does NOT do, then that is the correct answer.

So of the options, which one is something that postcolonialism does not do, i.e., it's not a feature.

Option C says postcolonialism doesn't consider colonial history. That's not true, so the statement in C is incorrect about postcolonialism, making it the answer.

Similarly, Option D says it doesn't consider inequality. That's also incorrect, so D is incorrect.

But wait, the options are presented as possible features. The question is which is NOT a feature.

Wait, the question is: Which is NOT a defining feature that distinguishes postcolonialism from others.

So the correct answer is the option that is not something postcolonialism is known for.

Looking for the option that is false about postcolonialism.

So let's evaluate each option:

A: Focus on economic factors. I think postcolonialism does consider economic factors, but maybe it's not the primary focus. Other theories focus more on economics, perhaps. So A could be a feature but I'm not certain.

B: Not European knowledge. Correct, so B is a feature.

C: Doesn't consider colonial history. Incorrect, so C is NOT a feature.

D: Doesn't consider inequality. Incorrect, so D is NOT a feature.

E: Considers nation/community. Correct.

F: Focus on violence. Correct.

G: Bilateral issues. Not sure, but I think postcolonialism looks at broader, structural issues rather than just bilateral. So G might be incorrect, meaning G is NOT a feature.

H: Disregards culture. Incorrect, H is NOT a feature.

I: Considers small wars. Correct.

So the options that are NOT features are C, D, G, H.

But the question asks which is NOT a defining feature, so the answer is one of these.

Wait, the options are from A to J, but the given options are A to I.

Looking back at the options, the choices are A-I.

So, looking for which is NOT a defining feature.

The question is phrased as, which of the following is NOT a defining feature.

So the correct answer is the option that postcolonialism does not emphasize.

From what I know, postcolonialism definitely considers colonial history (so C is wrong), considers inequality (so D is wrong), and considers culture (so H is wrong).

Which of these options is the correct answer.

The question is looking for the option that is NOT a feature. So the correct answer is the statement that is incorrect about postcolonialism.

So, of the options, which one is something that postcolonialism does NOT do.

Option C: Doesn't consider colonial history. No, it does, so C is the answer.

Option D: Doesn't consider inequality. No, it does, so D is the answer.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT a defining feature, so only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of what each option says.

The question asks which is NOT a defining feature.

So the correct answer is the option that is false.

So which of these does postcolonialism NOT do.

So, looking for the option that is false.

Option C: Postcolonialism doesn't consider colonial history. That's false because it does consider it, so C is the answer.

Option D: Doesn't consider inequality. Also false, but if the question has only one correct answer, then perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should look at each option again.

Option A: Primarily economic factors. I think postcolonialism isn't primarily about economics; maybe other theories like Marxism focus more on that. So perhaps A is NOT a defining feature. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Option C because it's the most directly opposite of what postcolonialism does.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to summarize.

Postcolonialism's key features include:

- Focus on the impact of colonialism and colonial history.

- Critique of Eurocentric perspectives, so it's not European knowledge.

- Considering the role of culture, identity, and violence.

- Examining inequalities, especially global inequality stemming from colonialism.

- Looking at various referent objects beyond the state.

- Examining small and asymmetric conflicts.

So, the options that are NOT features would be:

C: Doesn't consider colonial history → incorrect, so NOT a feature.

D: Doesn't consider inequality → incorrect, so NOT a feature.

H: Disregards culture → incorrect, so NOT a feature.

So the question is which of these is the correct answer.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer is the option that is NOT a feature, meaning the statement is false about postcolonialism.

So among the options, C, D, and H are false statements, but only one can be the answer.

Wait, the options are:

A: Economic factors.

B: Not European.

C: Doesn't consider colonial history.

D: Doesn't consider inequality.

E: Nation/community.

F: Violence.

G: Bilateral.

H: Disregards culture.

I: Small wars.

The question is asking which is NOT a defining feature.

So the correct answer would be the statement that is false about postcolonialism.

So, for example, if postcolonialism does consider colonial history, then option C is false, making it the correct answer.

Similarly, if it does consider inequality, then D is false.

Same with H.

But the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer.

So perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which of these is not considered a feature.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Option A, because postcolonialism isn't primarily about economic factors.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to think of it differently.

Which of the options is something that postcolonialism does not focus on.

For example, realism focuses on state security and military power. Neoliberalism on cooperation and institutions. Postcolonialism looks at the impact of colonialism, cultural factors, inequality, etc.

So, Option A: Economic factors. While postcolonialism might discuss economic factors as part of colonial exploitation, it's not the primary focus. So maybe A is not a defining feature.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps Option C is the answer because it directly contradicts a core aspect.

Wait, the question is about which is NOT a defining feature.

So, considering that, the answer is the option that is not something postcolonialism is known for.

I think the best approach is to go with Option C, as considering colonial history is a core part of postcolonialism, so saying it doesn't is incorrect, making C the answer.
</think>

To determine which option is NOT a defining feature of postcolonialism, we analyze each option in relation to the core principles of postcolonialism. Postcolonialism focuses on the impact of colonial history, critiques Eurocentric perspectives, considers cultural and identity factors, examines global inequality, and looks at security issues beyond traditional state-centric approaches, including small wars and asymmetric conflicts.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **A**: Postcolonialism may touch on economic factors as part of colonial exploitation, but it is not primarily focused on economic factors. Other theories, like Marxism, are more focused on economics. This might not be a defining feature.
- **B**: Postcolonialism is not a predominantly European form of knowledge, as it often comes from non-Western scholars. This is a defining feature.
- **C**: Postcolonialism explicitly considers the influence of colonial history on current security issues. Saying it does not is incorrect, making this a defining feature.
- **D**: Postcolonialism does consider the impact of global inequality, particularly inequality stemming from colonialism. This is a defining feature.
- **E**: Postcolonialism uniquely considers nation or community groups as valid referent objects in security studies. This is a defining feature.
- **F**: Postcolonialism employs a distinctive focus on the role of violence in world politics, especially colonial violence. This is a defining feature.
- **G**: Postcolonialism does not primarily focus on bilateral security issues but instead looks at broader structural and global issues. This is not a defining feature.
- **H**: Postcolonialism does not disregard cultural factors; it emphasizes their importance. This is a defining feature.
- **I**: Postcolonialism takes account of "small wars" and asymmetric conflicts. This is a defining feature.

### Conclusion:
The question asks for the option that is **NOT** a defining feature of postcolonialism. Based on the analysis, **C** ("Postcolonialism doesn't consider the influence of colonial history on current security issues") is the correct answer because it directly contradicts a core aspect of postcolonialism. While other options like **A**, **D**, and **H** are also incorrect, **C** is the most explicit and fundamental misrepresentation of postcolonialism.
