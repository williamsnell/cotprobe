Question:

A state legislature enacts a statute prohibiting the sale of contraceptive devices to married persons. This state statute prohibits the use of contraceptive devices by married persons. A physician who practices in the state brings suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state contraceptive statute. The physician attacks the validity of the statute on the grounds that it prevents him from giving professional advice concerning the use of contraceptives to three patients, all of whom are married, whose condition of health might be endangered by child bearing. The plaintiff is likely

Options:

D: not to have standing jus tertii.
E: not to have standing, unless the patients join the lawsuit
F: not to have standing, unless he can prove the health risk
G: not to have standing, because the law does not directly affect him
H: to have standing jus tertii.
I: to have standing, but only if he can prove the health risk

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with standing. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about a state statute that prohibits the sale of contraceptive devices to married persons and also prohibits their use. A physician is challenging this law in federal court. He says the statute prevents him from giving professional advice about contraceptives to his married patients, whose health might be endangered by childbearing. The question is whether he has standing.

Alright, standing. I remember that standing requires the plaintiff to have suffered an injury in fact, causation, and redressability. So, the plaintiff must show he's suffered a concrete and particularized injury, not just a general grievance.

In this case, the plaintiff is a physician. The statute prohibits selling and using contraceptives for married people. So, does this law directly impact the physician?

I think about cases where professionals are affected by laws that limit their practice. For example, in the past, there were cases where doctors challenged laws restricting abortion because those laws affected their ability to practice medicine.

Wait, there's a case called Eisenstadt v. Baird, which dealt with the distribution of contraceptives. But more relevant here might be cases where the plaintiff's professional activities are curtailed by a law.

Another point is third-party standing, jus tertii. That's when a plaintiff sues on behalf of someone else, like their patients. But the Supreme Court has rules about when that's allowed. I think the physician can have standing in his own right if the law affects his ability to give advice, which is part of his practice.

So the physician here can't give certain medical advice because the state law prohibits the use of contraceptives. That restriction might prevent him from providing his professional services as he sees fit. So he's suffering a direct injury—his freedom to practice medicine is being curtailed.

Also, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the court held that physicians have standing to challenge abortion laws because those laws impose a burden on their practice and their patients' rights. Similarly here, the physician is restricted from advising his patients, which affects his professional conduct.

So the key point is whether the physician has an injury. If the law prohibits him from giving advice, then yes, he's directly affected. He doesn't need to have his patients join because his own rights as a medical practitioner are at stake.

Looking at the options:

Option B says he is likely to have standing. Option J says he has standing but not on behalf of his patients. So if he's suing based on his own injury, J might make sense, but B says he has standing, period.

Wait, another angle: third-party standing. If the physician is trying to assert the rights of his patients, he might need to meet the criteria for jus tertii. But if he's suing based on his own inability to provide advice, then he doesn't need third-party standing. So the standing is based on his own professional rights, not the patients'.

So the correct answer would be that he has standing because the law impacts him directly. So between B and J.

Wait, option J says he has standing but not on behalf of his patients. But if he's suing on his own behalf, then that's correct. Because if he's asserting his own injury, he doesn't need the patients to be part of the suit. But if he's asserting the patients' rights, then he might need jus tertii, which has higher standards.

In this scenario, the physician is challenging the law because it affects his practice. So he's suing in his own right, not as a third party for the patients. Therefore, he has standing, making option B correct. But wait, looking at the options again:

Option B is "to have standing."

Option J is "to have standing, but not on behalf of his patients."

I think both B and J could make sense, but the distinction is about whether he's suing on his own behalf or the patients. Since he's attacking the statute because it prevents him from giving advice, he's suing in his own capacity, so his standing is based on his own injury, not as a representative of the patients. Therefore, he doesn't need the patients to join, and he doesn't need third-party standing.

So the correct answer would be B, he has standing. Alternatively, if the question is about whether he can bring the suit on behalf of the patients, but I think it's about his own standing.

Wait, but let me think again. The statute prohibits sale and use of contraceptives to married persons. The physician is affected because he can't provide the advice, which is part of his professional service. So he's directly regulated by the law. So yes, he has standing.

Another case: In Griswold v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court struck down a law banning contraceptives. But that was a challenge by individuals. Here, a physician is challenging the law, so it's a different scenario.

In the case of United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), the court discussed standing, but that's more about whether the injury is concrete. Here, the physician's injury is more direct.

So, I think the answer is B: to have standing.

The question revolves around whether a physician has standing to challenge a state statute prohibiting the sale and use of contraceptive devices to married persons. Standing requires the plaintiff to demonstrate an injury in fact, causation, and redressability. In this case, the physician alleges that the statute prevents him from providing professional advice about contraceptives to his married patients, whose health might be endangered by childbearing. This restriction directly impacts his ability to practice medicine, thereby causing a concrete and particularized injury.

The physician is not merely asserting the rights of his patients but is challenging the law based on its direct effect on his professional conduct. This distinguishes the case from third-party standing (jus tertii), where the plaintiff would need to meet additional criteria to sue on behalf of others. Here, the physician’s standing is based on his own injury as a medical practitioner, and he does not need the patients to join the lawsuit or prove third-party standing.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B**: The physician is likely to have standing because the statute directly affects his ability to provide medical advice, giving him a sufficient injury in fact.
- **Option J**: While this option suggests the physician has standing but not on behalf of his patients, it is less precise than Option B, as the focus is on the physician’s own injury rather than his relationship to the patients.

The most accurate answer is **Option B**, as the physician has standing based on the direct impact of the statute on his professional practice.

Answer: B
