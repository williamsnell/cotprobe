Okay, so I've got this question here about the average speeds of gas molecules, specifically O2 and CO2. Hmm, let me think. I remember from chemistry that the speed of gas molecules is related to their molar mass and temperature. Oh wait, the temperature is the same here, 0°C, so that simplifies things a bit.

So the average speed of O2 is given as 1700 km/h. I need to find the average speed of CO2 under the same conditions. I think the key here has to do with the molar masses of the two gases. The formula that comes to mind is the root mean square speed, which is sqrt(3RT/M), where R is the gas constant, T is temperature, and M is molar mass. 

Wait, but wait, the average speed might be different from the rms speed. Oh right, average speed is actually the mean speed, which is calculated differently. The formula for mean speed is sqrt((8RT)/(πM)). So both rms and mean speeds depend on the square root of (T/M). Since the temperature is the same, the speed is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass.

So let's get the molar masses. O2 has a molar mass of 32 g/mol (since each O is 16, 16*2=32). CO2 has a molar mass of 44 g/mol (C is 12, O is 16 each, so 12+16*2=44). 

Since the speeds are inversely proportional to sqrt(M), the ratio of their speeds would be sqrt(M_O2 / M_CO2). So the speed of CO2 should be speed of O2 multiplied by sqrt(32/44). Let me calculate that.

32 divided by 44 is the same as 8/11. The square root of 8/11 is approximately sqrt(0.727) which is around 0.853. So the speed of CO2 would be 1700 km/h multiplied by 0.853. Let me compute that: 1700 * 0.853.

1700 * 0.8 is 1360, and 1700 * 0.053 is approximately 90.1, so total around 1450 km/h. 

Looking back at the options, option E is 1450 km/h. That must be the correct answer. 

Wait, but wait a second. Did I mix up rms and average speed? Oh no, because I used the same formula for both, the temperature and R would cancel out, so the ratio depends only on the molar masses. So whether it's rms or average, the ratio would be the same. So the calculation should hold. So yes, 1450 is the right choice.

The average speed of gas molecules is inversely proportional to the square root of their molar mass, as given by the formula for mean speed: 

\[
v_{\text{mean}} = \sqrt{\frac{8RT}{\pi M}}
\]

Here, \( M \) is the molar mass, \( R \) is the gas constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. Since the temperature is the same for both O\(_2\) and CO\(_2\), the ratio of their speeds depends only on the square root of the inverse ratio of their molar masses:

\[
\frac{v_{\text{CO}_2}}{v_{\text{O}_2}} = \sqrt{\frac{M_{\text{O}_2}}{M_{\text{CO}_2}}}
\]

The molar mass of O\(_2\) is 32 g/mol, and the molar mass of CO\(_2\) is 44 g/mol. Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{v_{\text{CO}_2}}{v_{\text{O}_2}} = \sqrt{\frac{32}{44}} = \sqrt{\frac{8}{11}} \approx 0.853
\]

Given that the speed of O\(_2\) is 1700 km/h, the speed of CO\(_2\) is:

\[
v_{\text{CO}_2} = 1700 \times 0.853 \approx 1450 \, \text{km/h}
\]

Thus, the average speed of a CO\(_2\) molecule at 0°C is approximately **1450 km/h**.
