Okay, so I have this problem about finding the volume of a tetrahedron. Hmm, I remember that a tetrahedron is a type of pyramid with four triangular faces. But wait, the question says it has three mutually perpendicular faces and edges of lengths 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm. Oh right, I think this is a right tetrahedron, where the three edges meeting at one vertex are perpendicular to each other.

So, how do I find the volume of such a tetrahedron? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I think it's similar to how we find the volume of a rectangular prism, but adjusted for the tetrahedron. Oh wait, right! For a rectangular box, the volume is length × width × height, which makes sense because it's three dimensions multiplied. But a tetrahedron is like a pyramid, so I think the formula involves a third of something.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If the three edges are perpendicular and meet at a vertex, then the tetrahedron is like one-eighth of a rectangular prism. Because imagine the prism with sides a, b, c. The tetrahedron would occupy a corner, and the rest would be divided into other parts. Oh wait, no, actually, I think the volume of the tetrahedron is (a*b*c)/6. Because the prism would have volume a*b*c, and the tetrahedron is 1/6th of that. Wait, why 1/6? Let me think. Oh right, because the prism can be divided into 6 such tetrahedrons. So each one is 1/6 of the total.

So applying that formula here, the edges are 3, 4, and 5 cm. So plugging into the formula, (3*4*5)/6. Let me calculate that. 3 times 4 is 12, times 5 is 60. Then 60 divided by 6 is 10.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, I remember that the volume V of a right tetrahedron is (abc)/6, where a, b, c are the mutually perpendicular edges. So yeah, that's exactly the case here. So substituting a=3, b=4, c=5, V = (3×4×5)/6 = 60/6 =10 cm³.

Looking at the options, option D is 10 cm³. So the answer should be D.

But wait, another way to think about it: the volume of a tetrahedron can be found using the scalar triple product of the vectors defining its edges from a common vertex. If the edges are perpendicular, then the vectors are orthogonal, and their scalar triple product is just the product of their magnitudes. Then divide by 6. So yes, the same formula applies. So yes, the answer is 10, which is option D.

The volume of a right tetrahedron with three mutually perpendicular edges of lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by the formula:

\[
V = \frac{a \cdot b \cdot c}{6}
\]

Here, the edge lengths are \(a = 3 \, \text{cm}\), \(b = 4 \, \text{cm}\), and \(c = 5 \, \text{cm}\). Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
V = \frac{3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5}{6} = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

Thus, the volume of the tetrahedron is \(10 \, \text{cm}^3\), which corresponds to option **D**.
