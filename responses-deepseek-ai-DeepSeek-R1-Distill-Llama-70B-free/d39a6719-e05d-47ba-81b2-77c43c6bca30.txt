Okay, so I've got this question here about a tornado's wind velocity and barometric pressure at different distances from the center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to break it down.

The question says that the wind velocity 5 miles from the center is 30 mph, and the barometer reads 29 inches of mercury. I need to find the wind velocity half a mile from the center and the corresponding barometric pressure. The options are from A to J, each giving different values.

Wait, I remember something about the relationship between wind speed and distance from the center in a tornado. Oh right, it's probably related to the idea that the wind speed increases as you get closer to the center. But how exactly? I think it's an inverse square relationship, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, inverse square law applies to things like gravitational or electric fields where the intensity decreases with the square of the distance. But in this case, if the wind speed is higher closer in, maybe it's the opposite. Oh wait, maybe it's the area that matters. Like, the area over which the same amount of air is moving is smaller when you're closer, so the speed must be higher.

Right, Bernoulli's equation might come into play here because it relates pressure and velocity. Bernoulli's principle states that faster moving air has lower pressure. So, if the wind is moving faster near the center, the pressure should be lower there.

But how do I model the velocity change with distance? Let's think about the flow. If the tornado is assumed to be a rotating column, maybe the velocity varies with distance from the center. I'm trying to recall if this is a case of a free vortex or a forced vortex. Oh wait, forced vortex has angular velocity constant, like a solid body rotation, and velocity is proportional to radius. But free vortex (like in irrotational flow) has velocity proportional to 1/r.

Wait, no, I think for a free vortex, the velocity v is related to the angular momentum, which is conserved. So v would be proportional to 1/r, where r is the distance from the center.

But wait, the question is about the velocity at two different radii, so if the velocity is inversely proportional to the radius, then v1 * r1 = v2 * r2.

Wait, the initial situation is at r1 =5 miles, v1=30 mph. The second situation is at r2=0.5 miles, so I can set up the equation: v2 = v1 * (r1/r2).

Yes, that makes sense because if you're closer, the radius is smaller, so velocity increases.

So plugging in the numbers: r1 is 5 miles, r2 is 0.5 miles. So v2 = 30 mph * (5 / 0.5) = 30 *10 = 300 mph.

Wait, that's a big jump. So the wind speed at half a mile would be 300 mph. Now looking at the options, let's see which ones have 300 mph.

Looking at options A and I. Option A says 300 mph and 29 in. Hg. Option I says 300 mph and 25.62 in. Hg.

Now the next part is the barometric pressure. So I need to calculate the pressure at 0.5 miles from the center. I know that at 5 miles, the pressure is 29 in. Hg.

Wait, how is pressure related here? Well, Bernoulli's equation says that the static pressure is lower when the velocity is higher because the dynamic pressure (due to motion) increases. So the total pressure remains the same, but static pressure drops.

Wait, Bernoulli's equation is (for incompressible flow):

P + ½ ρ v² + ρ g y = constant.

Assuming that the elevation (y) doesn't change much here, maybe we can ignore the gravity term. So P + ½ ρ v² = constant.

So between two points, the sum of static pressure and dynamic pressure is the same. So if the velocity increases, the static pressure must decrease.

So applying Bernoulli's equation between the two points.

At point 1 (5 miles, 30 mph): P1 = 29 in Hg.

At point 2 (0.5 miles, 300 mph): P2 = ?

So the equation is:

P1 + ½ ρ (v1)^2 = P2 + ½ ρ (v2)^2

Wait, no, wait. Because the total pressure (sum) is the same, so P1 + ½ ρ (v1)^2 = P2 + ½ ρ (v2)^2.

Wait, no, that's if the flow is along a streamline and the other terms are negligible. So rearranging:

P2 = P1 + ½ ρ (v1^2 - v2^2)

Wait, wait, let me make sure. Let me write it step by step.

Bernoulli's equation: P + ½ ρ v² = constant.

So P1 + ½ ρ (v1)^2 = P2 + ½ ρ (v2)^2.

Solve for P2:

P2 = P1 + ½ ρ (v1^2 - v2^2 )

Wait no, because it's (v2)^2 is bigger, so P2 would be lower than P1 by that amount. Yes.

But to compute this, I need the density of air, which is given as ρ_air = 0.00238 slug/ft^3.

The velocities are in mph, though. I need to convert them to ft/s to use in the equation.

Wait, 30 mph to ft/s: 30 miles per hour. There are 5280 feet in a mile and 3600 seconds in an hour.

So 30 mph = 30 * 5280 ft / 3600 s.

Calculating that: 30*5280 = 158400. Divided by 3600: 158400/3600 = 44 ft/s.

Similarly, 300 mph: 300 *5280 /3600. 300*5280=1,584,000. Divided by 3600: 440 ft/s.

Wait, 44 ft/s and 440 ft/s.

Wait, that's a big jump in velocity. Let me confirm the calculations.

Yes, mph to ft/s: multiply by 5280/3600 = 1.46667.

So 30 mph * 1.46667 ≈ 44 ft/s.

300 mph *1.46667≈440 ft/s.

Now, compute the dynamic pressure difference.

So, P1 is 29 in Hg, and we need to find P2.

But wait, the equation gives the difference in static pressure. So:

P2 = P1 - ½ ρ (v2² - v1² )

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Because from Bernoulli, the higher velocity leads to lower pressure. So P2 = P1 + ½ ρ (v1² - v2² )

Because v2 is bigger than v1, so (v1² - v2²) is negative, so P2 is lower than P1.

So the equation is correct: P2 = P1 + ½ ρ (v1² - v2² )

Compute ½ ρ (v1² - v2^2):

But wait, let me compute the values.

v1 =44 ft/s → v1² = 44^2=1936 ft²/s².

v2=440 ft/s → v2²= (440)^2=193600 ft²/s².

So (v1^2 - v2^2) = 1936 - 193600 = -191,664 ft²/s².

Multiply by ½ ρ:

½ * 0.00238 slug/ft³ * (-191664) ft²/s².

Wait, let's compute that.

0.5 * 0.00238 = 0.00119.

Multiply by -191664: 0.00119 * (-191664) = let's compute.

0.00119 * 191664 = Let's see, 191,664 * 0.001 is 191.664. 0.00019 * 191664 ≈ 36.515. So total is about 191.664 +36.515 ≈ 228.179. But since it's negative, it's -228.179.

Wait, but in what units? Slug is unit of mass, ft²/s² is (ft/s)^2. So the term ½ ρ (v^2) is in units of (slug/ft³)(ft²/s²) → slug/(ft s²) → which is (mass)/(length time squared). Force per area is pressure, which in slug units would be lb.force = slug * ft/s².

Wait, perhaps I should convert the pressure into consistent units. Because the ½ ρ v² term is in lb/ft², and the barometric pressure is given in inches of mercury.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let's compute the pressure difference in lb/ft², then convert that to inches of mercury.

So, the term we have is ½ ρ (v1² - v2^2 ) = -228.179 lb/ft².

Wait, wait, wait, no. Let me think about units.

Density, ρ, is in slug/ft³.

v is in ft/s. So v² is ft²/s².

So ½ ρ v² → (slug/ft³) * (ft²/s²) → slug/(ft s²). 

But 1 slug = 1 lbf*s²/ft. So substituting that: ( (lbf s²/ft ) / ft³ ) * ft²/s² ) → lbf / ft².

So yes, ½ ρ v² is in lb per square foot (lb/ft²), which is a unit of pressure.

So, the term ½ ρ (v1² - v2^2 ) is equal to -228.179 lb/ft².

So P2 = P1 + (-228.179 lb/ft² )

But P1 is given in inches of mercury. So I need to convert P1 to lb/ft² to do the calculation.

Wait, 1 atmosphere is about 29.92 in Hg, and 1 atmosphere is 2116.2 lb/ft².

But wait, the given rho_air is 0.00238 slug/ft³. Let me check if that makes sense. At sea level, rho_air is approximately 0.00238 slug/ft³, which is correct.

So, 1 ft Hg is 13.55 ft of water. Wait, but how much pressure is that in lb/ft²?

Wait, the question says 1 ft Hg =13.55 ft of water. Hmm, but we can convert inches of Hg to lb/ft².

Wait, the pressure due to a column of fluid is P = rho * g * h.

So, let's compute the pressure in lb/ft² for 29 in Hg.

First, convert 29 inches to feet: 29/12 ≈2.4167 ft.

Density of mercury is known, but since the question gives a conversion factor, maybe that's easier.

Wait, 1 ft Hg corresponds to 13.55 ft of water. So 1 ft Hg = 13.55 ft water.

So, 1 ft Hg = 13.55 ft water.

The density of water is 62.4 lb/ft³. So the pressure from 1 ft of water is: 62.4 lb/ft³ * 1 ft * g. Wait, but since we're using lb-force units, the g is accounted for in the conversion.

Wait, no, in the English system, pressure is lb/ft². So the pressure from a column of water is rho_water * g * h. But in the unit conversion, perhaps we can use the given factor.

Wait, the question says 1 ft Hg = 13.55 ft water. So 1 ft Hg is equivalent in pressure to 13.55 ft of water.

So the pressure in lb/ft² for 29 in Hg is:

First, 29 inches is 29/12 ft ≈ 2.4167 ft Hg.

So 2.4167 ft Hg * 13.55 ft water per ft Hg = 2.4167 *13.55 ≈ let's compute that.

2.4167 *13.55. Let me calculate:

2 *13.55=27.1

0.4167 *13.55≈ 5.645

So total ≈27.1 +5.645=32.745 ft water.

So 29 in Hg ≈32.745 ft water.

Now, the pressure from 32.745 ft of water is rho_water * g * h.

But in English units, 1 ft of water is 62.4 lb/ft³ * 1 ft * g (which is 32.174 lbm-ft/lbf-s², but perhaps in pressure terms, 1 ft of water is approximately 62.4 lb/ft². Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, the pressure at the bottom of a column of water is P = rho_water * g * h.

In English units, rho_water is 62.4 lbm/ft³, g is 32.174 ft/s², and h is in ft.

So P = 62.4 lbm/ft³ * 32.174 ft/s² * h ft.

But since 1 lbf = 32.174 lbm-ft/s², so lbm-ft/s² = lbf.

So P = (62.4 * 32.174) * h lb/ft².

Compute 62.4 *32.174. Let me approximate.

62.4 * 30 =1872, 62.4 *2.174≈135.5. So total ≈1872 +135.5≈2007.5 lb/ft² per foot of water.

Wait, no, wait that's not right because 62.4 lbm/ft³ *32.174 ft/s² = 62.4 *32.174 lb/ft² per foot.

Compute 62.4 *32.174 = Approximately 62 *32 =1984, plus 0.4*32≈12.8, so around 1996.8 lb/ft² per ft.

So 1 ft of water ≈1996.8 lb/ft². So 32.745 ft water would be 32.745 *1996.8 lb/ft².

Wait, that's a huge number. Wait, but wait, that would be 32.745 * ~2000= ~65,490 lb/ft².

But wait, standard atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psi, which is 14.7 *144 lb/ft²=2116.8 lb/ft². So 32.745 ft water can't be 65,000 lb/ft². I think I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should use the fact that 1 ft of water is approximately 62.4 lb/ft². Because that's what I remember.

Wait, no, wait. Let's compute it correctly.

P = rho * g * h.

In English units, rho is in lbm/ft³, g is ft/s², h is ft.

So P = (lbm/ft³) * (ft/s²) * (ft) → (lbm*ft)/(ft³ s²) ) → (lbm)/(ft² s²).

But 1 lbf = 1 lbm * g / c, where c is the conversion factor. Wait, perhaps that's complicating it.

Alternatively, using the fact that 1 psi is 1 lb per square inch. To convert to lb/ft², 1 psi = 144 lb/ft².

But for water, 1 ft of water is 0.433 psi. So 1 ft water = 0.433 psi = 0.433 *144 lb/ft² ≈ 62.352 lb/ft².

Ah, so 1 ft of water is approximately 62.352 lb/ft².

Therefore, 32.745 ft water = 32.745 *62.352 lb/ft².

Compute that: 32 *62.352 = 1996. 0.745 *62.352≈46.5. So total ≈1996 +46.5=2042.5 lb/ft².

So 29 in Hg is about 2042.5 lb/ft².

Wait, but that can't be, because earlier I thought that atmospheric pressure is about 2116 lb/ft². So 29 in Hg is about 14.7 psi * 144 =2116 lb/ft². Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the units here.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's use the conversion factor given in the question.

The question states that 1 ft Hg =13.55 ft of water. So we can compute the pressure in lb/ft² for 1 ft Hg, then scale it to 29 inches.

But wait, another approach: since 1 ft Hg =13.55 ft water, and 1 ft water is 62.4 lb/ft² (as per the 0.433 psi), then 1 ft Hg is 13.55 *62.4 lb/ft².

Compute 13.55 *62.4 = Let's see, 10*62.4=624, 3.55*62.4≈221.4. So total≈624+221.4=845.4 lb/ft².

So 1 ft Hg =845.4 lb/ft².

So 29 in Hg is 29/12 ft Hg ≈2.4167 ft.

Multiply by 845.4 lb/ft² per ft Hg: 2.4167 *845.4 ≈ let's compute.

2 *845.4 =1690.8

0.4167 *845.4 ≈ 352.4.

So total ≈1690.8 +352.4≈2043.2 lb/ft².

So P1 is 2043.2 lb/ft².

Now, the term from Bernoulli is ½ ρ (v1² -v2² ) = -228.179 lb/ft².

So P2 = P1 + (½ ρ (v1² -v2² )) → 2043.2 + (-228.179) = 2043.2 -228.179 ≈1815.02 lb/ft².

Wait, but earlier I thought that atmospheric pressure is about 2116 lb/ft², so 181
