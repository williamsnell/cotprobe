Okay, so I have this question about aesthetics. Hmm, what's aesthetics again? I remember it's related to beauty and art. Let me think. Aesthetics is the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of beauty and taste. It's about what makes something beautiful or pleasing.

The question is asking, "Aesthetics deals with objects that are_____." The options are A through J. I need to pick the correct one.

Looking at the options:

A: not essential to our existence
B: frequently used in daily life
C: not visible to the human eye
D: only appreciated by experts
E: universally liked
F: unimportant to most people
G: essential for survival
H: essential to our existence
I: rarely viewed
J: universally disliked

So, what kind of objects does aesthetics focus on? Well, aesthetics is about things that are beautiful or have artistic value. These aren't the same as essential things we need for survival. For example, a painting or a sculpture is an aesthetic object. These aren't necessary for survival, but they bring value to our lives in terms of beauty or emotional impact.

So, looking at the options, A says "not essential to our existence," which sounds right. Because while food, water, shelter are essential, aesthetic objects are more about enjoyment and appreciation rather than necessity.

Let me check the other options to make sure. B is about frequent use, which might not always be the case. Some art is only viewed occasionally. C is about visibility, but art is usually visible. D says only experts appreciate them, but many people enjoy art without being experts. E says universally liked, but that's not true because beauty is subjective. F says unimportant, which I don't think is correct because aesthetics do matter to people. G and H are about being essential, which I don't think applies. I is about rarely viewed, which isn't necessarily true. J is about being disliked, which is the opposite.

So the correct answer should be A: not essential to our existence.

Aesthetics focuses on objects related to beauty and artistic value, which are not necessary for survival but enrich our lives through appreciation and enjoyment. These objects are not essential to our existence.
