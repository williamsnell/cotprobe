Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spaceship losing heat through radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question says the spaceship's surface is at 40°F, and its emissivity is 0.1. Space is considered a perfect black body at 0°R. The spaceship is modeled as a gray infinite cylinder. I need to find the net radiant heat loss per square foot.

Wait, right, radiant heat transfer is all about the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is Q = εσA(T^4 - T_surrounding^4), but since it's an infinite cylinder, maybe I need to adjust the formula. Oh, right, for an object surrounded by a much larger space, the surrounding is like a blackbody. So the spaceship emits radiation and also absorbs from space.

First, I should probably convert the temperatures to absolute units because the Stefan-Boltzmann law uses Kelvin or Rankine. Oh wait, the spaceship's temperature is given in Fahrenheit, and space's temperature is 0°R, which is Rankine. Right, so I need to convert 40°F to Rankine. 

How do I convert Fahrenheit to Rankine? Oh yeah, Rankine is Fahrenheit plus 459.67. So 40°F is 40 + 459.67 = 499.67°R. Space is at 0°R, so that's easy.

The emissivity ε is given as 0.1. The Stefan-Boltzmann constant σ is 0.1714×10^-8 Btu/hr-ft²-°R⁴, if I remember correctly. Wait, or is that in different units? No, I think that's right for English units. Let me make sure: yes, σ is approximately 0.1714e-8 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R⁴).

So the formula for the net heat loss per unit area (since the question is per square foot) would be Q/A = εσ(T^4 - T_surrounding^4). Since it's per area, the A cancels out.

Plugging the numbers in: ε is 0.1, σ is 0.1714e-8, T is 499.67°R, and T_surrounding is 0°R. So the surrounding term is zero. So the equation simplifies to Q/A = 0.1 * 0.1714e-8 * (499.67)^4.

Wait, but the spaceship is an infinite cylinder, which I think affects the view factor. Oh wait, no, because when an object is in space, it's surrounded, so the emissivity and view factor are considered. For a cylinder, the effective emissivity might be adjusted, but the problem says to model it as a gray body. Oh wait, emissivity already accounts for that. So perhaps the formula remains the same.

Wait, but wait, for a cylinder, the radiation exchange might be different. Hmm, I'm a little confused here. Let me think again. The Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiative heat transfer from an object to its surroundings is Q = εσA(T^4 - T_surr^4), regardless of the geometry, as long as the emissivity accounts for the shape. But wait, emissivity is a property of the material, not the shape. So maybe the shape doesn't affect the calculation here because the formula is per unit area. So I can proceed with the formula as is.

So let's compute each part. First, calculate (T^4). T is 499.67 R. 499.67 to the fourth power. Let me compute that step by step.

Wait, 500^4 is (5e2)^4 = 625e8, which is 6.25e11. But since it's 499.67, which is about 500 - 0.33. So approximately, maybe I can calculate (500 - 0.33)^4. But that's a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 499.67^4 exactly.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to compute 500^4 first and then adjust. 500^4 is 500*500*500*500. 500^2 is 250,000, so 500^4 is 250,000 squared, which is 62,500,000,000. So 6.25e10. Wait, no, 250,000^2 is 62,500,000,000, which is 6.25e10. So 500^4 is 6.25e10 R^4.

Wait, but 499.67 is 500 - 0.33. Let me calculate (a - b)^4, where a=500, b=0.33. The expansion would be a^4 - 4a^3 b + 6 a^2 b² -4 a b^3 + b^4. But since b is small, the terms beyond the second might be negligible.

So a^4 is 6.25e10.

4a^3 b = 4*(500)^3 *0.33. 500^3 is 125e6. Multiply by 4: 500e6. Multiply by 0.33: approx 165e6.

So 4a^3 b = 4 * 125e6 *0.33 = 4 * 41,250,000 = 165,000,000.

So 6.25e10 - 165e6 is approximately 6.249835e10. Wait, but the subtraction is actually 6.25e10 minus 0.165e9. Because 165e6 is 0.165e9.

Wait, 6.25e10 is 62,500,000,000. Subtract 165,000,000: 62,500,000,000 - 165,000,000 = 62,335,000,000. So 6.2335e10. But wait, the higher-order terms (like 6a²b²) would be even smaller. Because 6*(500)^2*(0.33)^2. 500^2 is 250,000. 0.33^2 is 0.1089. So 6 * 250,000 * 0.1089 = 6 * 250,000 * 0.1089 = 6 * 27,225 = approx 163,350. So that's 1.6335e5, which is much smaller than the 165e6 term. So maybe the approximation is sufficient.

So T^4 is approximately 6.2335e10 R^4.

Wait, but wait, I think I messed up the calculation. Because 500^4 is 6.25e10, and subtracting 4a^3 b which is 165e6, which is 0.165e9, so 6.25e10 - 0.165e9 = 6.249835e10? Wait, no, 6.25e10 is 62,500,000,000. Subtracting 165,000,000 (which is 0.165e9) gives 62,500,000,000 - 165,000,000 = 62,335,000,000, which is 6.2335e10. So yes, T^4 is approximately 6.2335e10.

But wait, 499.67 is actually 40°F converted correctly. Because 40°F in Rankine is indeed 40 + 459.67 = 499.67 R. So T^4 is (499.67)^4. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute (500 - x)^4 where x is 0.33. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just proceed with the approximate value of 6.2335e10 R^4.

So now, the equation becomes:

Q/A = 0.1 * 0.1714e-8 * (6.2335e10) 

Let me compute that step by step. First, 0.1 multiplied by 0.1714e-8 is 0.01714e-8, which is 1.714e-10.

Then, multiply by 6.2335e10: (1.714e-10) * (6.2335e10) = 1.714 * 6.2335 * 1e0. Because 1e-10 * 1e10 is 1e0.

Calculating 1.714 * 6.2335: Let me compute that. 1.7 *6 is 10.2, 0.014 *6 is 0.084. So approximately 10.284. But more accurately, let's do 1.714 * 6.2335:

1.714 * 6 is 10.284.

1.714 * 0.2335: Let's compute 1.714 * 0.2 = 0.3428; 1.714 * 0.0335 ≈ 0.057449. So total is 0.3428 + 0.057449 ≈ 0.400249.

So total is 10.284 + 0.400249 = 10.684249.

So approximately 10.684. So the product is about 10.684 Btu/hr-ft².

Wait, but wait: the formula is Q/A = εσ(T^4 - T_surr^4). Since T_surr is 0, it's just εσT^4.

So the calculation is 0.1 * 0.1714e-8 * (T^4), which we approximated as 10.684. But wait, let me check the exact calculation again.

Wait, 0.1 * 0.1714e-8 is 0.01714e-8 = 1.714e-10.

Multiply by 6.2335e10:

1.714e-10 * 6.2335e10 = 1.714 * 6.2335 = Let me compute that precisely.

1.714 * 6 = 10.284
1.714 * 0.2335 = ?

1.714 * 0.2 = 0.3428
1.714 * 0.03 = 0.05142
1.714 * 0.0035 = 0.005.999
Adding those: 0.3428 + 0.05142 = 0.39422 + 0.005999 ≈ 0.400219.

So total is 10.284 + 0.400219 = 10.684219.

So about 10.684 Btu/hr-ft². But wait, none of the options exactly match 10.68. Let me check the options:

Options are:

A:17.2

B:6.5

C:14.2

D:11.5

E:15.4

F:9.8

G:10.71

H:13.7

I:12.3

J:8.5

So option G is 10.71, which is very close to our approximation of 10.684. Hmm, that's a good sign. But wait, perhaps my approximation for T^4 was a bit off. Maybe I should calculate T^4 more accurately.

Let me compute T^4 more accurately. T is 499.67 R.

So 499.67^4. Let me compute step by step.

First, compute 499.67 squared. 499.67 * 499.67.

Well, 500^2 is 250,000. The difference is (500 - 0.33)^2 = 500^2 - 2*500*0.33 + (0.33)^2 = 250000 - 330 + 0.1089 = 249,670.1089.

So 499.67^2 ≈ 249,670.11.

Now, square that to get (499.67)^4: (249,670.11)^2.

Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute 249,670.11 squared.

Compute (250,000 - 329.89)^2 = 250,000^2 - 2*250,000*329.89 + (329.89)^2.

250,000^2 = 62,500,000,000.

2*250,000*329.89 = 500,000 * 329.89 = 164,945,000.

(329.89)^2 ≈ let's compute 330^2 = 108,900, subtract (0.11)^2 and some cross terms. Wait, 329.89 is 330 - 0.11, so (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b².

So 330² = 108900.

2ab = 2 * 330 * 0.11 = 72.6.

b² = (0.11)^2 = 0.0121.

So (329.89)^2 = 108900 - 72.6 + 0.0121 ≈ 108827.4121.

So putting it all together:

62,500,000,000 - 164,945,000 + 108,827.4121.

Wait, wait: because (a - b)^2 is a² - 2ab + b², so when a is 250,000 and b is 329.89, it's 62.5e9 - 164.945e6 + 0.108827e6 ≈ 62.5e9 - 164.836e6 = ?

Wait, 62,500,000,000 minus 164,945,000 is 62,500,000,000 - 164,945,000 = 62,335,055,000.

Then, adding 108,827.4121 gives 62,335,055,000 + 108,827.41 ≈ 62,335,163,827.41.

So (499.67)^4 ≈ 6.233516382741e10.

Wait, because 62,335,163,827.41 is 6.233516382741e10.

So now, going back to the formula:

Q/A = 0.1 * 0.1714e-8 * 6.23351638e10.

Compute that:

0.1 * 0.1714e-8 = 0.01714e-8 = 1.714e-10.

Multiply by 6.23351638e10:

1.714e-10 * 6.23351638e10 = 1.714 * 6.23351638 = ?

1.714 * 6 = 10.284.

1.714 * 0.23351638 ≈ Let me compute 1.714 * 0.23351638.

1.714 * 0.2 = 0.3428.

1.714 * 0.03351638 ≈ 

First, 1.714 * 0.03 = 0.05142.

1.714 * 0.00351638 ≈ approx 0.00603.

So adding: 0.05142 + 0.00603 ≈ 0.05745.

So 0.3428 + 0.05745 ≈ 0.40025.

So total is 10.284 + 0.40025 = 10.68425.

So about 10.684 Btu/hr-ft².

Looking at the options again, option G is 10.71, which is very close. But wait, perhaps my approximation for T^4 was a bit off. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, maybe I should use exact calculation. Let me compute 499.67^4 precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps using exact exponentials isn't necessary and the approximation is sufficient. Another thought: perhaps the emissivity is applied differently. Oh wait, the emissivity is 0.1, which is much lower than 1, so the heat loss is lower.

Wait, but according to the calculation, it's about 10.684, and the closest option is G:10.71, which is 10.71. That's about 0.026 difference, which is probably due to more precise calculation of T^4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recompute the exact T^4 value.

Wait, 499.67 R is 40°F. Let me compute 499.67^4 more accurately.

Compute 499.67^2:

499.67 * 499.67.

Well, 500 * 500 = 250,000.

But 499.67 = 500 - 0.33.

So (500 - 0.33)^2 = 500^2 - 2*500*0.33 + 0.33^2.

So 250,000 - 330 + 0.1089 = 249,670.1089.

So 499.67^2 = 249,670.1089.

Now, square that to get 499.67^4:

(249,670.1089)^2.

We can write this as (249,670.1089)^2 = ?

Let me compute this step by step.

249,670.1089 * 249,670.1089.

This is going to be a bit tedious, but perhaps we can compute it as:

= (250,000 - 329.8911)^2

= 250,000^2 - 2 * 250,000 * 329.8911 + (329.8911)^2

250,000^2 = 62,500,000,000.

2 * 250,000 * 329.8911 = 500,000 * 329.8911 = 164,945,550.

(329.8911)^2 = let's compute this.

329.8911^2. Let me compute 330^2=108,900. Then, 329.8911 is 330 minus 0.1089.

So (330 - 0.1089)^2 = 330^2 - 2 * 330 * 0.1089 + (0.1089)^2.

330^2 = 108,900.

2 * 330 * 0.1089 = 660 * 0.1089 ≈ 71.829.

(0.1089)^2 ≈ 0.01188.

So (329.8911)^2 ≈ 108,900 - 71.829 + 0.01188 ≈ 108,900 - 71.81712 ≈ 108,828.18288.

Putting it all together:

62,500,000,000 - 164,945,550 + 108,828.18288 =

62,500,000,000
