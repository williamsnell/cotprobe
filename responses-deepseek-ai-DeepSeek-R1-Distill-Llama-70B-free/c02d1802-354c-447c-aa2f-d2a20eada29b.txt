Question:

A defendant was on the first day of her new secretarial job when her boss called her into his office. The boss directly suggested that if the defendant did not go out on a date with him, she would be fired in one week. Every day during the remainder of the week, the boss approached the defendant with his demand, and the defendant refused to cooperate. At the end of the week, when the boss called the defendant into his office and again tried to pressure her to go out on a date with him, the defendant knocked him unconscious with a giant stapler and choked him to death. The defendant is tried for murder. In accordance with the following statute, the state relies at trial on the presumption of malice:"When the act of killing another is proved, malice aforethought shall be presumed, and the burden shall rest upon the party who committed the killing to show that malice did not exist. "If the defendant is convicted of first-degree murder and challenges her conviction on the grounds of the above statute, on appeal she will

Options:

A: lose, because the presumption may be rebutted.
B: win, because the statute violates due process.
C: lose, because the presumption of malice aforethought is constitutional.
D: win, because she acted in self-defense.
E: lose, because her actions were premeditated.
F: win, because the statute is unjust.
G: lose, because she did not show that malice did not exist.
H: win, because the statute is discriminatory.
I: lose, because she failed to overcome the presumption.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with murder and the presumption of malice. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's read the question carefully. The scenario is about a defendant who was on her first day of a new job. Her boss immediately starts pressuring her to go out on a date, threatening to fire her if she doesn't comply. Every day that week, he repeats this demand, and she refuses each time. Finally, at the end of the week, when he tries again, she attacks him with a stapler, knocking him unconscious and choking him to death. Now, she's on trial for murder, and the state is relying on a presumption of malice based on a specific statute.

The statute says that when the act of killing another is proved, malice aforethought is presumed, and the burden is on the defendant to show that malice didn't exist. The question is about whether her conviction will stand on appeal, challenging this statute.

I need to figure out which option is correct. The options are from A to I, each presenting a different outcome.

Let me recall some criminal law concepts. Murder typically requires malice aforethought, which can be express or implied. Express malice is when the intent to kill is deliberate, while implied malice might involve situations like acting with wanton disregard for human life.

The statute in question creates a presumption that malice exists once the killing is proven. The burden then shifts to the defendant to rebut this presumption. But is such a presumption constitutional?

I remember that in criminal law, the prosecution generally bears the burden of proving each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Shifting the burden to the defendant might raise due process issues because it could potentially violate the principle that the state must prove guilt beyond a doubt.

The key here is whether the presumption is a rebuttable presumption or a mandatory one. If it's a rebuttable presumption, the defendant can present evidence to counter it. But if the presumption is irrebuttable, it could be problematic because it might relieve the state of its burden to prove an essential element.

In this case, the statute says the burden rests on the defendant to show malice didn't exist. So it's a rebuttable presumption. But does that violate due process? I think the U.S. Supreme Court has addressed similar issues.

I recall the case of Mullaney v. Wilbur, where the Supreme Court dealt with a presumption of malice in a murder case. The Court held that placing the burden on the defendant to prove that he acted in the heat of passion (which would reduce the charge to manslaughter) violated due process. The reasoning was that the state must prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, including malice.

Applying that to this scenario, the statute at hand presumes malice and shifts the burden to the defendant. This is similar to what was found unconstitutional in Mullaney. Therefore, the statute would likely be held to violate due process because it shifts the burden of proof on an essential element (malice) to the defendant.

So, looking at the options, option B says she will win because the statute violates due process. That aligns with my reasoning. Other options can be eliminated: for example, options C and G suggest the presumption is okay or that she didn't rebut it, but if the statute is unconstitutional, her failure to rebut becomes irrelevant because the burden shouldn't have been on her in the first place.

Option D mentions self-defense, but the facts don't indicate that she was in imminent danger when she killed him. He was pressuring her all week, but the killing occurred when he tried again, but I don't see evidence of immediate threat at the moment she acted. So self-defense might not apply here.

Options E and F are about premeditation and the statute being unjust, which don't directly address the constitutional issue. Option A suggests she loses because the presumption can be rebutted, but if the statute is unconstitutional, the ability to rebut doesn't matter.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of a statute that presumes malice aforethought in a murder case, shifting the burden to the defendant to prove otherwise. The defendant killed her boss after a week of harassment and intimidation, and the state relied on this presumption at trial. The key issue is whether this statute violates due process.

In criminal law, the prosecution must prove all elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The statute in question creates a rebuttable presumption of malice, shifting the burden to the defendant to show that malice did not exist. This raises concerns under due process, as it potentially relieves the state of its burden to prove an essential element of the crime.

The Supreme Court addressed a similar issue in *Mullaney v. Wilbur*, where it held that a statute presuming malice and requiring the defendant to prove heat of passion (to reduce the charge to manslaughter) violated due process. The Court emphasized that the state must prove each element of the crime, including malice, beyond a reasonable doubt. Applying this precedent, the statute in this case is likely unconstitutional because it improperly shifts the burden of proof to the defendant.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B** correctly identifies that the defendant will win on appeal because the statute violates due process, aligning with the reasoning in *Mullaney v. Wilbur*.  
- Other options, such as **C**, **G**, and **A**, are incorrect because they assume the statute is constitutional or focus on the defendant's ability to rebut the presumption, which is irrelevant if the statute itself is unconstitutional.  
- **D** is incorrect because the facts do not support a self-defense claim, as there was no imminent threat at the time of the killing.  
- **E** and **F** are irrelevant to the constitutional issue.  

Thus, the correct answer is **B**.

Answer: B
