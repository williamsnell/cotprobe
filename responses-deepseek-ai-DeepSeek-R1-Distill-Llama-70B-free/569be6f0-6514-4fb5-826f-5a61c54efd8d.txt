Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Mill and how he determines the value of pleasures. The question is asking, according to Mill, what we must do to decide if one pleasure is more valuable than another. The options are A through J.

From what I remember, Mill was a utilitarian, specifically a proponent of hedonistic utilitarianism, but he had some differences from Bentham. Bentham I think focused more on the quantity of pleasure, like how intense or long-lasting it is. But Mill, on the other hand, emphasized the quality of pleasure. So for Mill, not all pleasures are equal. He believed that some pleasures are inherently better because they come from higher faculties or are more meaningful.

Wait, the question is about how to determine which pleasure is more valuable. So, according to Mill, how do we figure that out? I think he said that we should look at which pleasure is preferred by those who have experienced both. Because someone who's experienced a higher pleasure wouldn't choose a lower one, even if the lower one is more intense. So, for example, someone who's read a lot and appreciated literature wouldn't choose a base pleasure over that, even if the base one feels more intense at the moment.

Looking at the options, option A says "determine which pleasure most experienced people prefer." That sounds right. Because Millâ€™s approach is that the preferences of people who have experienced both are the best judges. So if most people who've had both choose one over the other, that's the higher pleasure.

Let me check the other options to be sure. Option B says consult science. I don't think Mill relied on science for this; it was more about informed preference. Option C is about religious leaders, which doesn't fit Mill's utilitarian approach. Option D talks about objective pleasure, but Mill's view is more about subjective preferences of informed people. Option E is about intensity, which is more Bentham, not Mill. Option F is about attainability, which doesn't directly relate to the value of pleasure. Option G is personal preference, but Mill emphasizes the collective preference of experienced individuals. Option H is about universal preference, which might be similar, but I think it's more about those who have the experience. Option I is duration, again more quantitative, which is Bentham. Option J is philosophers, which might not be what Mill suggests.

So the correct answer should be A.

According to Mill, the value of a pleasure is determined by the preferences of those who have experienced both the pleasures being compared. He believed that individuals who have experienced higher and lower pleasures would consistently choose the higher ones, as they are more fulfilling and meaningful. This aligns with option A, which states that we should determine which pleasure most experienced people prefer.

Answer: A
