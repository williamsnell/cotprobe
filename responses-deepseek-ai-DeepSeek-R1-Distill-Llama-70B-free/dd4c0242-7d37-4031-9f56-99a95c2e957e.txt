Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two conductors connected in series and parallel, and I need to figure out where the heating is greater in each case. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the two conductors are of the same length and material but have different cross-sectional areas. So, same material means same resistivity, right? And same length too, so the only difference is the cross-sectional area, which affects the resistance.

I remember that resistance R is given by R = ρ * L / A, where ρ is resistivity, L is length, and A is cross-sectional area. So if one conductor has a larger A, its resistance R will be smaller, and vice versa.

The question is about heating. Oh right, heating in a resistor is related to power dissipation, which is given by P = V²/R when connected across a voltage V. Or alternatively, P could be calculated using I²R, since power can be expressed that way too.

Let me tackle each case separately: series and parallel connections.

Case (a): Connected in series. So the two resistors are in series. In a series connection, the current I is the same through both resistors. The voltage across each resistor will depend on their resistances. So the one with higher resistance will have a higher voltage across it.

Since power is I²R, and the current is the same, the resistor with higher R will dissipate more power (heat). But wait, in series, the larger cross-sectional area conductor has a smaller R, right? Because A is larger. So the one with smaller A has larger R. So in series, the conductor with smaller cross-sectional area will have higher resistance and thus higher power dissipation, meaning more heating.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me make sure. Let me say conductor 1 has a larger area than conductor 2. So R1 = ρL/A1, R2 = ρL/A2. Since A1 > A2, R1 < R2. So in series, the current I is same, and power is I²R. So since R2 is larger, P2 is larger. So more heating in conductor 2, which has smaller cross-sectional area.

So in series, the one with smaller A has higher heating.

Case (b): Connected in parallel. Now, when connected in parallel, the voltage across each resistor is the same. So each is connected to the same potential difference V.

Power here is V²/R. So the resistor with smaller resistance (larger A) will have lower power, while the resistor with higher resistance (smaller A) will have higher power.

Because R is higher for smaller A, V²/R will be larger for that resistor. So in parallel, the conductor with smaller cross-sectional area will have higher power dissipation, thus more heating.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, in parallel, the voltage is same across both, so the one with higher R would have higher power because P=V²/R. Oh, no, wait. If R is bigger, then V²/R would be smaller, not bigger. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait no, no. Let's say R is bigger. So V²/R would be smaller. Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Wait, no, that can't be correct. Because if a resistor has higher resistance, for the same voltage, the current is lower (I=V/R), so power is I² R = (V²/R) * R = V². Wait no, that would make power equal to V squared, independent of R. That can't be right. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, P=I²R. And I for a resistor in parallel is V/R. So P = (V^2 / R^2) * R = V²/R. So yes, power is V²/R. So a higher R leads to lower power. So in parallel, the resistor with smaller R (larger A) will have higher power. Because if R is smaller, V²/R is larger.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think with numbers. Let's say V is 10 volts.

If R1 is 5 ohms: P1=10^2 /5=20 watts.

If R2 is 10 ohms: P2=100/10=10 watts.

So R1 has smaller resistance, so P is higher. So in parallel, the resistor with smaller R (larger A) will have higher power, meaning more heating.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in parallel, the smaller A conductor (which has larger R) would have lower power. So the larger A (smaller R) would have higher power. So in parallel, the conductor with larger cross-section area would have higher heating.

Wait, this is conflicting with my initial thought. Let me re-express this.

In parallel, each resistor has the same V across them. Power is V²/R. So lower R → higher power.

Since R is inversely proportional to A (R=ρL/A), a larger A means smaller R. So, larger A → smaller R → higher power.

So in parallel, the conductor with larger cross-sectional area will have higher power dissipation, thus more heating.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So in series, the smaller A (higher R) has higher power. In parallel, the larger A (smaller R) has higher power.

So in each case, the conductor with the smaller cross-sectional area in series has more heating, and the larger cross-sectional area in parallel has more heating.

Wait, but looking back at the problem, the question is for each case (a) series and (b) parallel, which conductor has greater heating.

So summarizing:

(a) Series: more heating in the conductor with smaller cross-sectional area.

(b) Parallel: more heating in the conductor with larger cross-sectional area.

Wait, but what about the options? Let me look at the options:

Option C: Greater in the larger A when series; smaller A when parallel.

Wait, no. Because in series, smaller A has higher heating. So option C says when in series, larger A has greater heating—wrong. So option C is incorrect.

Option I: Greater in smaller A when in parallel; larger A when series. No, in series, smaller A, so that's the opposite of option I.

Option J: Greater in smaller A when series; greater in larger A when parallel. Yes, that's what I've concluded.

Wait, option J says: Greater in the smaller cross-sectional area when in series; greater in the larger when in parallel.

Yes, that's what I have.

So the correct answer should be option J.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the options.

Looking at the options:

Option J: Greater in the conductor with the smaller cross-sectional area when in series; greater in the conductor with the larger cross-sectional area when in parallel.

Yes, that's correct.

Another option to check is option G: Greater in smaller A regardless of connection. That's not correct because in parallel, larger A has greater heating.

So the correct answer is option J.

To determine where the heating is greater in each case, we analyze the power dissipation in the conductors. The power dissipated in a resistor is given by \( P = I^2R \) or \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \), depending on the connection type. The resistance of a conductor is \( R = \frac{\rho L}{A} \), where \( \rho \) is resistivity, \( L \) is length, and \( A \) is cross-sectional area. Since the conductors have the same material and length, the resistance depends only on the cross-sectional area (\( R \propto \frac{1}{A} \)).

### Case (a): Series Connection
In a series connection, the current \( I \) is the same through both conductors. The power dissipated is \( P = I^2R \). Since \( I \) is constant, the conductor with the higher resistance (\( R \)) will dissipate more power. A smaller cross-sectional area corresponds to a higher resistance (\( R \propto \frac{1}{A} \)). Therefore, in a series connection, the conductor with the smaller cross-sectional area will experience greater heating.

### Case (b): Parallel Connection
In a parallel connection, the voltage \( V \) across each conductor is the same. The power dissipated is \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \). Since \( V \) is constant, the conductor with the smaller resistance (\( R \)) will dissipate more power. A larger cross-sectional area corresponds to a smaller resistance (\( R \propto \frac{1}{A} \)). Therefore, in a parallel connection, the conductor with the larger cross-sectional area will experience greater heating.

### Conclusion
- In a series connection, the conductor with the smaller cross-sectional area has greater heating.
- In a parallel connection, the conductor with the larger cross-sectional area has greater heating.

This matches the description in **Option J**.
