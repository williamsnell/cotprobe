Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that a ball of mass m is tossed upward without any air resistance and reaches a height of 20 meters. Then it's asking about the net force on the ball when it's at the 10-meter position, which is halfway up. The options are from A to J with various multiples of mg.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with projectile motion under gravity, especially when air resistance is neglected, the only force acting on the ball is gravity. So the net force should be equal to the weight of the ball, which is mg. But wait, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, the ball is moving upward, so it's in motion against gravity. Oh, right, when the ball is going up, it decelerates due to gravity. But does that affect the net force? I think the net force is still mg downward because that's the only force acting on it. There's no other force mentioned, like air resistance or anything else. So the net force should be mg.

Wait, but the question is about the net force at the 10-meter point, which is halfway. Does the position affect the force? Hmm, gravity near the Earth's surface is roughly constant, right? So whether it's at 10 meters or 20 meters, the gravitational force is approximately the same, especially if we're assuming it's near the Earth's surface. So the net force should still be mg.

Wait, but wait a second. When the ball is at the highest point, its velocity is zero, but here it's halfway, so it's moving upward but slowing down. The net force is still mg because that's the only force. So the net force is mg acting downward.

Looking at the options, option I is mg. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but I might be getting confused between net force and other concepts. Let me think again. When an object is in motion under gravity, the net force is mg regardless of its position as long as we're near Earth. So yeah, the answer is I.

In the absence of air resistance, the only force acting on the ball is gravity, which exerts a constant downward force equal to the ball's weight, \( mg \). This remains true regardless of the ball's position or velocity, as long as the motion occurs near the Earth's surface where gravity is approximately constant. At the 10-meter position, halfway up, the net force on the ball is still \( mg \), as no other forces are acting on it.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

I: \( mg \)

Answer: I
