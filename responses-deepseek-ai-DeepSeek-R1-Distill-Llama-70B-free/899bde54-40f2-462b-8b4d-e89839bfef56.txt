Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about polarized light and intensity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. 

The question says that unpolarized light is incident on a pair of ideal linear polarizers. The transmission axes are at a 45-degree angle with each other. And we need to find out what percentage of the incident intensity comes through both polarizers.

Wait, I remember that when light passes through a polarizer, if it's initially unpolarized, the intensity gets cut in half. Because unpolarized light has all possible polarizations, and the polarizer only allows one plane through. So the first polarizer would let through 50% of the incident intensity.

But then there's a second polarizer. Oh right, the angle between their transmission axes is 45 degrees. I think Malus's Law comes into play here. Malus's Law says that the transmitted intensity is I = I0 * cos²(theta), where theta is the angle between the polarizer's axis and the light's polarization.

Wait, the first polarizer would polarize the light along its axis, say at 0 degrees. The second polarizer is at 45 degrees relative to the first. So the angle theta between the light's polarization (from the first polarizer) and the second's axis is 45 degrees.

So the intensity after the first polarizer is I1 = (I0)/2. Then, passing through the second, it's I2 = I1 * cos²(45°).

What's cos(45°)? Oh, that's √2/2, so squared is 1/2. So I2 becomes (I0/2) * (1/2) = I0/4. 

I0 is the initial intensity, so I2 is 25% of I0. So the transmitted intensity is 25% of the incident intensity.

Looking at the options: option D is 25%, so that must be the answer.

When unpolarized light passes through the first ideal linear polarizer, the intensity is reduced by half because the polarizer allows only one plane of polarization to pass through. This leaves the transmitted intensity as \( I_1 = \frac{I_0}{2} \), where \( I_0 \) is the incident intensity.

The second polarizer is oriented at an angle of \( 45^\circ \) relative to the first. According to Malus's Law, the transmitted intensity through the second polarizer is given by:

\[
I_2 = I_1 \cdot \cos^2(\theta),
\]

where \( \theta = 45^\circ \). Substituting \( \cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), we find:

\[
\cos^2(45^\circ) = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Thus, the intensity after the second polarizer is:

\[
I_2 = \frac{I_0}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{I_0}{4}.
\]

This means the transmitted intensity is 25% of the incident intensity. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

D: 25%.
