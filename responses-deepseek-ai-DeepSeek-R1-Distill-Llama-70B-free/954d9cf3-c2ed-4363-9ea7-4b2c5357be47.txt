Okay, so I have this question about birthstones, and I need to figure out the correct answer. The question is asking what the birthstone for January is. I'm a bit rusty on my birthstones, so I'll have to think this through.

First, I remember that each month has a specific gemstone associated with it. I think some of them are pretty common, like diamonds for April, right? So, let's try to list out what I know.

January, February, March... I think February is amethyst because I've heard that before. March might be aquamarine or bloodstone, but I'm not too sure. April is definitely diamond. May is emerald, I think. June has pearl and moonstone, maybe? July is ruby, I believe. August is peridot or something like that. September is sapphire. October has opal and tourmaline. November is topaz, maybe? December is turquoise, zircon, or something else.

Wait, but the question is about January. Let me think. I'm trying to remember if it's garnet or something else. I've heard of garnet being a dark red stone. Oh, I think I saw somewhere that January's birthstone is garnet. So that must be the answer.

Looking at the options, option I is garnet. So the answer should be I.
