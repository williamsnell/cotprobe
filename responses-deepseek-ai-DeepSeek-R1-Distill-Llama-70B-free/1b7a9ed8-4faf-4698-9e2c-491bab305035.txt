Okay, so I have this logic problem in front of me, and I'm supposed to figure out if the argument is valid using indirect truth tables. If it's invalid, I need to pick a counterexample from the given options. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the structure of the argument. The premises are:

1. (K · L) ⊃ M
2. N ⊃ ~M
3. N ∨ K

And the conclusion is L ⊃ K. Wait, no, looking again, the conclusion is actually given as part of the premises? Wait no, the argument is presented as:

Premises:
1. (K · L) → M
2. N → ~M
3. N ∨ K

And the conclusion is supposed to be L → K. Or wait, maybe I misread. Let me check the problem again.

Wait, the problem says the argument is as follows:

(K · L) ⊃ M
N ⊃ ~M
N ∨ K
∴ L ⊃ K

Wait no, looking again, the last line says "N ∨ K / L ⊃ K". Oh, I see, so the premises are the first three lines, and the conclusion is L → K. So the argument is:

Premise 1: (K ∧ L) → M
Premise 2: N → ¬M
Premise 3: N ∨ K
Conclusion: L → K

Wait, no, the conclusion is written as "L ⊃ K". So the argument is that from the three premises, we can conclude that L implies K.

My task is to determine if this argument is valid. If it's not valid, I need to find a counterexample from the options provided.

I remember that an argument is valid if in every possible scenario where all the premises are true, the conclusion is also true. If there's even one scenario where the premises are all true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that scenario serves as a counterexample.

Since the problem suggests using indirect truth tables, I think that method involves assuming the premises are true and the conclusion is false, and then checking if such a scenario is possible.

So, let's outline the steps for the indirect method:

1. Assume that all premises are true and the conclusion is false.
2. Then, derive the truth values of the individual propositions (K, L, M, N) based on this assumption.
3. If this leads to a consistent set of truth values (no contradictions), then the argument is invalid because we've found a counterexample.
4. If it leads to a contradiction, the argument is valid.

So, let's proceed.

Assume:
- Premise 1: (K ∧ L) → M is true.
- Premise 2: N → ¬M is true.
- Premise 3: N ∨ K is true.
- Conclusion: L → K is false.

Wait, the conclusion is L → K. For this implication to be false, L must be true and K must be false. Because in logic, an implication A→B is false only when A is true and B is false.

So, under our assumption for the indirect method, we have:

- L is true (because conclusion is false, so antecedent true, consequent false)
- K is false (since conclusion is L→K, which is false when K is false and L is true)

So, K is false, L is true.

Now, with K being false, let's look at the premises.

Premise 3: N ∨ K is true. Since K is false, N must be true (because for a disjunction to be true, at least one disjunct must be true). So N is true.

Now, Premise 2: N → ¬M is true. Since N is true, for the implication to hold, ¬M must be true, which means M is false.

Premise 1: (K ∧ L) → M. Let's check this. K is false, L is true, so K ∧ L is false. In an implication, if the antecedent is false, the entire implication is true regardless of M. So, (false) → M is automatically true, which aligns with Premise 1 being true.

So, let's summarize the assumed scenario:

- K: false
- L: true
- N: true
- M: false

Now, let's check if all premises hold in this scenario.

Premise 1: (K ∧ L) → M
(K is false, L true) → M is false → (false) → false is true, because any implication with a false antecedent is true.

Premise 2: N → ¬M. N is true, ¬M is true (since M is false). So true → true is true.

Premise 3: N ∨ K is true ∨ false → true, which holds.

Conclusion: L → K. L is true, K is false, so L→K is false. Which is what we assumed.

So, this scenario is consistent. All premises are true, and the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is invalid, and this scenario serves as a counterexample.

Now, let's look at the options provided to find which one matches this scenario.

The options are:

A: Valid
B: Invalid. Counterexample when L, M, N are true and K is false.
Wait, in our scenario, L is true, M is false, N is true, K is false.

So, L is true, M is false, N is true, K is false.

Looking at the options:

Option D says: "Invalid. Counterexample when L and N are true and K and M are false." That matches exactly our scenario.

Option B says L, M, N true; K false. But in our case, M is false, so Option B is not correct.

Option C: L and M true, K and N false. That's not our case either.

So the correct answer should be Option D.

To determine the validity of the argument, we use the indirect truth table method. The argument is:

1. \((K \land L) \to M\)
2. \(N \to \neg M\)
3. \(N \lor K\)
4. \(\therefore L \to K\)

### Assumptions for Indirect Method:
- All premises are true.
- The conclusion \(L \to K\) is false.

For \(L \to K\) to be false, \(L\) must be true and \(K\) must be false.

### Deriving Truth Values:
1. From \(K = \text{false}\) and \(N \lor K = \text{true}\), \(N\) must be true (since \(K\) is false).
2. From \(N = \text{true}\) and \(N \to \neg M\), \(\neg M\) must be true, so \(M = \text{false}\).
3. From \(K = \text{false}\), \(L = \text{true}\), and \((K \land L) \to M\), the antecedent \(K \land L\) is false. An implication with a false antecedent is always true, so this premise holds.

### Summary of Truth Values:
- \(K = \text{false}\)
- \(L = \text{true}\)
- \(M = \text{false}\)
- \(N = \text{true}\)

### Checking Premises:
1. \((K \land L) \to M\): \((\text{false} \land \text{true}) \to \text{false}\) is true.
2. \(N \to \neg M\): \(\text{true} \to \neg \text{false}\) is true.
3. \(N \lor K\): \(\text{true} \lor \text{false}\) is true.

### Conclusion:
In this scenario, all premises are true, but the conclusion \(L \to K\) is false. This constitutes a counterexample, proving the argument is invalid.

### Matching the Counterexample to Options:
The scenario matches **Option D**: "Invalid. Counterexample when \(L\) and \(N\) are true and \(K\) and \(M\) are false."
