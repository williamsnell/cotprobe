Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says.

The problem states: "A tape deck sells for $200. The dollar markup is $80. Find the percent markup based on the selling price." And then there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that markup has to do with the profit a seller makes on a product. Markup can be calculated in dollars (which is the flat amount added to the cost) or as a percentage, which is relative to either the cost or the selling price. So the question is asking for the percentage markup, but specifically based on the selling price.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I understand the terms correctly. The selling price is the final price the product is sold for, which here is $200. The dollar markup is the amount added to the cost to get to the selling price. So if the markup is $80, that means the cost price plus $80 equals $200.

Oh right, so the cost price must be the selling price minus the markup. Let me calculate that. Selling price is $200, markup is $80, so cost price is 200 minus 80, which is $120. So the cost is $120, and the markup is $80, making the selling price $200.

Now, the question is about percent markup. I think there are two ways to calculate markup percentage: one based on the cost price and another based on the selling price. Since the question specifies "based on the selling price," I need to calculate it that way.

The formula for percent markup based on selling price is (Markup Amount / Selling Price) multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. So plugging in the numbers, that's 80 divided by 200 times 100.

Let me do that math. 80 divided by 200 equals 0.4. Multiply by 100, that's 40%. So the percent markup based on the selling price is 40%.

Looking at the options, option A is 40%. So that's the answer.

Wait a second, just to make sure I didn't mix up the formulas. Another way is to think about markup based on cost. In that case, the formula would be (Markup / Cost) *100. So using that, 80 divided by 120 is 0.666..., which is about 66.67%. But the question isn't asking that; it's asking based on selling price, so my initial calculation should be correct.

Yes, I think I'm confident that the correct answer is 40%, which is option A.

To determine the percent markup based on the selling price, we start with the given values: the selling price is $200, and the dollar markup is $80. 

First, calculate the cost price by subtracting the markup from the selling price:
\[
\text{Cost Price} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Markup} = 200 - 80 = 120.
\]

Next, use the formula for percent markup based on the selling price:
\[
\text{Percent Markup} = \left( \frac{\text{Markup Amount}}{\text{Selling Price}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{80}{200} \right) \times 100 = 40\%.
\]

Thus, the percent markup based on the selling price is **40%**, corresponding to option A.
