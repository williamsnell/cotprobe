Okay, so I need to find the pH of a 0.2 M solution of formic acid, and I know the Ka is 1.76 × 10^-4. Hmm, formic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. I remember from my chemistry class that for weak acids, we can use the formula involving the square root of Ka times the concentration, but wait, only when the dissociation is small compared to the initial concentration. 

Wait, let me think. The general formula is that for a weak acid HA, the [H+] is approximately sqrt(Ka * C), where C is the concentration. So here, C is 0.2 M. Let me plug in the numbers. 

Ka is 1.76e-4, so 1.76e-4 multiplied by 0.2 gives... let's see, 1.76 * 0.2 is 0.352, so 0.352e-4, which is 3.52e-5. Taking the square root of that. The square root of 3.52 is about 1.876, so the square root of 3.52e-5 is 1.876e-2.5, wait, no, wait: 3.52e-5 is the same as 3.52 × 10^-5. The square root of that would be sqrt(3.52) × 10^(-5/2). 

Wait, let me calculate that correctly. The square root of 3.52 is approximately 1.876. Then 10^-5/2 is 10^-2.5, which is the same as 1e-2.5. Wait, 10^-2 is 0.01, 10^-3 is 0.001, so 10^-2.5 is 3.16e-3, because 10^0.5 is about 3.16. So 1e-2.5 is 3.16e-3. So 1.876 * 3.16e-3 would be... let's compute that. 

1.876 times 3 is 5.628, and 1.876 times 0.16 is about 0.300. So adding 5.628 + 0.300 is about 5.928e-3. So [H+] is approximately 5.928e-3 M. Then pH is -log(5.928e-3). Let me calculate that. 

Log(5.928e-3) is log(5.928) + log(1e-3). Log(5.928) is about 0.7715, since log(5)=0.69897, log(6)=0.77815; 5.928 is close to 6. So approximately 0.7715. Then log(1e-3) is -3. So log(5.928e-3) is 0.7715 -3 = -2.2285. So pH is -(-2.2285) = 2.2285, which is approximately 2.23.

Wait, but I should check the assumption that the dissociation is small. The initial concentration is 0.2 M, and the [H+] we found is about 5.9e-3, which is 0.0059 M. So 0.0059 / 0.2 is about 0.0295, which is 2.95%, which is less than 5%, so the approximation holds. So the pH should be around 2.23.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.23. So the answer should be B.

To determine the pH of a 0.2 M solution of formic acid (HCOOH), we use the formula for weak acids: 

\[
[H^+] \approx \sqrt{K_a \cdot C}
\]

Here, \( K_a = 1.76 \times 10^{-4} \) and \( C = 0.2 \, \text{M} \). Substituting these values:

\[
[H^+] = \sqrt{(1.76 \times 10^{-4}) \cdot 0.2} = \sqrt{3.52 \times 10^{-5}}
\]

The square root of \( 3.52 \times 10^{-5} \) is approximately \( 5.928 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \). Thus:

\[
[H^+] \approx 5.928 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

The pH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[H^+] = -\log(5.928 \times 10^{-3})
\]

Breaking this down:

\[
\log(5.928 \times 10^{-3}) = \log(5.928) + \log(10^{-3}) \approx 0.7715 - 3 = -2.2285
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{pH} \approx 2.23
\]

To verify, the dissociation percentage is:

\[
\frac{[H^+]}{C} \times 100 = \frac{5.928 \times 10^{-3}}{0.2} \times 100 \approx 2.95\%
\]

Since this is less than 5%, the approximation is valid. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**B: 2.23**
