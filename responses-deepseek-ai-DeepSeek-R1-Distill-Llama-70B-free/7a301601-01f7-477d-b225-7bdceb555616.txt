Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the isoelectric point of glycine. Hmm, I remember that the isoelectric point, or pI, is the pH at which a molecule has an equal number of positive and negative charges. So for amino acids like glycine, which are zwitterionic, this is important.

The problem gives me the two dissociation steps of glycine+. Wait, glycine+ is the protonated form, right? Because the structure is ^+NH3CH2COOH. So that's the fully protonated form, I think.

The first dissociation is k1, with pK1 = 2.35. That step is when the carboxyl group (COOH) loses a proton. Because the first step would be the COOH deprotonating to COO^-.

The second dissociation is k2, with pK2 = 9.78. That's when the amino group (NH3+) loses a proton, turning into NH2.

Wait, so glycine has two pKa values: one for the carboxyl group and one for the amino group. But in this case, since the starting point is the fully protonated glycine+ (which is a cation), the first deprotonation is the carboxyl group, and the second is the amino group.

Wait, no. Wait, the starting form is ^+NH3CH2COOH. So that's the form where both the amino group is protonated (NH3+) and the carboxyl is protonated (COOH). Then, the first dissociation (k1) is the loss of a proton from the carboxyl group. So the species after first dissociation is ^+NH3CH2COO^-, which is the zwitterion. Then the second dissociation (k2) is the loss of a proton from the amino group, leading to NH2CH2COO^-.

Wait, but wait, for amino acids, the pKa values are typically around 2 for the carboxyl and around 9.5 for the amino. So this glycine+ must be a diprotic species.

Wait, but in this case, the species is a cation because it's glycine^+, which I think is the fully protonated form. So the first deprotonation is from the carboxyl group, so that pK1 is 2.35. The second is from the amino group, pK2 is 9.78.

Wait, but in general, for amino acids, the first pKa is for the carboxyl group (COOH losing a proton), and the second pKa is for the amino group (NH3+ losing a proton). So the pI is the average of these two pKa values when the molecule is in the zwitterionic form.

Wait, wait no. Wait, the isoelectric point is calculated as the average of the two pKa values when the molecule has equal positive and negative charges. So for a molecule that can donate and accept protons, like an amino acid, the pI is (pKa1 + pKa2)/2 when the molecule is in the form where it has one positive and one negative charge, so the net charge is zero.

But wait, in this problem, the starting point is the glycine+ species, which has a +1 charge. So the first dissociation step (k1) would take it to the zwitterion form, which has zero net charge (one positive, one negative). Then the second dissociation (k2) would take it to the fully deprotonated form, with a -1 charge.

So to find the isoelectric point, I think we're looking for the pH where the net charge is zero. That occurs at the point between the first and second dissociation steps. Or wait, no. Wait, the pI is the pH where the average of the two relevant pKa's is taken.

Wait, for amino acids, the general formula for pI is (pKa1 + pKa2)/2 when the molecule is a diprotic and has two dissociable groups. So here, since the first pKa is 2.35 (carboxyl) and the second pKa is 9.78 (amino), the pI is (2.35 + 9.78)/2.

Wait, wait, let me think again. Because glycine, as a neutral molecule, has a structure where the carboxyl is deprotonated and the amino is protonated, making the zwitterion. So the pKa1 is for the carboxyl group (COOH → COO^- + H+), and the pKa2 is for the amino group (NH3+ → NH2 + H+).

So the pI is indeed the average of pKa1 and pKa2. So let's compute that.

pKa1 is 2.35, pKa2 is 9.78. Adding them gives 2.35 + 9.78 = 12.13, divided by 2 is 6.065. So approximately 6.07.

Looking at the options, option H is 6.07. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, the given species is glycine^+, which is the fully protonated cation. So in solution, when it dissociates, it goes to the zwitterion, then to the fully deprotonated anion.

But the isoelectric point is when the average charge is zero. So the pI is the point where the molecule is in the zwitterionic form. So the pI is the average of the two pKas, which are 2.35 and 9.78.

Yes, that makes sense. So the calculation is correct, and the answer should be 6.07, which is option H.

The isoelectric point (pI) is the pH at which a molecule has an equal number of positive and negative charges, resulting in a net charge of zero. For amino acids like glycine, which are diprotic, the pI is calculated as the average of the two pKa values corresponding to the dissociation of the carboxyl group (pKa1) and the amino group (pKa2).

In this problem, the dissociation steps of glycine+ are as follows:

1. **First dissociation (pKa1 = 2.35):** The carboxyl group (COOH) loses a proton, forming the zwitterion ^+NH3CH2COO^-.
2. **Second dissociation (pKa2 = 9.78):** The amino group (NH3+) loses a proton, forming the fully deprotonated species NH2CH2COO^-.

The pI is the pH at which the molecule is in the zwitterionic form, where the number of positive charges equals the number of negative charges. This is calculated as:

\[
\text{pI} = \frac{\text{pKa1} + \text{pKa2}}{2}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{pI} = \frac{2.35 + 9.78}{2} = 6.07
\]

Thus, the isoelectric point of glycine is 6.07, which corresponds to option H.
