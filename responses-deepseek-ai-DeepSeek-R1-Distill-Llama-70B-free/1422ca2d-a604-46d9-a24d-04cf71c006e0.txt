Okay, so I need to figure out which of these convolution kernels, when applied to an image, won't change the image. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on my image processing, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that a convolution kernel is a small matrix that slides over an image, performing some operation on the pixels. The result depends on the values in the kernel. If the kernel is such that it's like an identity operation, then the image remains unchanged.

The identity kernel for convolution is a 3x3 matrix where the center is 1 and everything else is 0. Because when you convolve with that, you're just taking each pixel and not changing it. So any kernel that's all zeros except the center would leave the image the same.

Looking at the options:

Option A is a 3x3 zero matrix. If I convolve with all zeros, that would make every pixel zero, which definitely changes the image. So A is out.

Option B is a 3x3 identity matrix. Each diagonal is 1, and others are zero. Wait, no, the identity matrix is 1s on the diagonal, but in convolution, usually, the kernel is symmetric around the center. Wait, no. Wait, the identity kernel is just a single 1 in the center, and zeros elsewhere. So option B isn't that. Let me check. Option B's matrix is:

1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1

Wait, that's a 3x3 matrix with 1s on the main diagonal. But in convolution, how does this affect the image? Each pixel would be replaced by a sum of its own value and the values of the other pixels multiplied by the kernel. Wait, but if the kernel is like that, each pixel's new value would be the sum of itself plus the other diagonal pixels multiplied by 1. No, wait, no. Wait, no, actually, convolution with a kernel that's 1s on the diagonal might not do that. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, actually, the standard identity kernel would be a 3x3 matrix where only the center is 1, and others are zero. So that when you convolve, each output pixel is just the input pixel, so the image doesn't change.

Looking back at the options, option H is a kernel with a single 1 in the center. Let me check option H.

Option H's kernel is:

0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0

Yes, that's the identity kernel. So convolving with this should leave the image unchanged. So option H would be correct.

Wait, but let me look at the other options to make sure. Let's see.

Option B: the matrix is 3x3 with 1s on the diagonal. So when you convolve, each pixel becomes the sum of itself and the top-left, center, and bottom-right pixels. Wait, no, actually, each element in the resulting pixel is a weighted sum of the neighborhood.

Wait, no. Convolution works by flipping the kernel and sliding it over the image. Oh wait, in some definitions, convolution includes flipping the kernel, but in image processing, sometimes people just use a kernel without flipping, which is technically a cross-correlation. So for this question, I think the standard approach applies.

But for the identity kernel, the key point is that each pixel's output is the same as the input. That's achieved when the kernel has a 1 in the center and 0 elsewhere. So option H is correct.

But wait, let me check the other options. Could any other options also result in no change?

Looking at option B again, the matrix has 1s on the diagonal. So when you convolve, each pixel would be computed as the sum of the corresponding positions in the kernel multiplied by the image's neighborhood.

Wait, the kernel's first row is [1,0,0], second [0,1,0], third [0,0,1]. So when you convolve, each pixel is computed as:

For a pixel at (i,j), its new value would be 1*image(i-1,j-1) + 0*image(i-1,j) + 0*image(i-1,j+1)
+ 0*image(i,j-1) + 1*image(i,j) + 0*image(i,j+1)
+ 0*image(i+1,j-1) + 0*image(i+1,j) + 1*image(i+1,j+1)

Wait, no, wait. I think I'm getting the kernel indices wrong. Let me think again. The kernel is a 3x3 matrix. For each position, the kernel is applied such that the center of the kernel aligns with the current image pixel.

So when you convolve, each output pixel (i,j) is the sum over the kernel elements multiplied by the corresponding image pixels. So for kernel K, the value at (i,j) is sum_{dx, dy} K[dx, dy] * image[i+dx, j+dy], but I think the kernel is flipped in the convolution process. Or wait, maybe not. Hmm, perhaps in image processing, they don't flip the kernel, so it's more like a sliding window without flipping.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think differently. The identity kernel is the one that doesn't change the image. So the only kernel that does that is the one with a single 1 in the center.

So option H is the correct one.

Wait, but what about option B? Let me think about it again. If the kernel is the identity matrix, does it act as an identity operation? Or does it do something else.

If I have a kernel that's 1s on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere, then each pixel's new value would be the sum of the pixel itself and the top-left and bottom-right pixels, each multiplied by 1. So for example, the new value at (i,j) would be image[i-1,j-1] + image[i,j] + image[i+1,j+1]. That would definitely change the image, adding neighboring pixels to the current one. So option B would change the image, so B is not correct.

Similarly, looking at other options:

Option H is the only one with a single 1 in the center. So when you convolve, each pixel remains the same because it's multiplied by 1 and all other contributions are zero. So the image doesn't change.

Therefore, the correct answer is H.

To determine which convolution kernel does not change the image, we need to identify the kernel that acts as an identity operation. In image processing, the identity kernel is a 3x3 matrix with a single 1 in the center and 0s elsewhere. When this kernel is applied, each pixel in the output image is identical to the corresponding pixel in the input image, leaving the image unchanged.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: A 3x3 matrix of all zeros. Convolving with this kernel would result in a completely black image, as all pixel values would be zero. This changes the image, so **A is incorrect**.

- **Option B**: A 3x3 matrix with 1s on the main diagonal and 0s elsewhere. Convolving with this kernel would replace each pixel with a weighted sum of itself and the top-left and bottom-right pixels, altering the image. Thus, **B is incorrect**.

- **Option C**: A 3x3 matrix with 1s in specific positions. Convolving with this kernel would modify the image by combining neighboring pixel values, so **C is incorrect**.

- **Option D**: A 3x3 matrix with 1s in the first row and 0s elsewhere. This kernel would shift or alter the image, so **D is incorrect**.

- **Option E**: A 3x3 matrix of all 1s. Convolving with this kernel would compute the sum of a 3x3 neighborhood around each pixel, changing the image. Thus, **E is incorrect**.

- **Option F**: A 3x3 matrix with 1s in the bottom row and 0s elsewhere. This kernel would shift or alter the image, so **F is incorrect**.

- **Option G**: A 3x3 matrix with 1s in a cross pattern. Convolving with this kernel would combine neighboring pixel values, altering the image. Thus, **G is incorrect**.

- **Option H**: A 3x3 matrix with a single 1 in the center and 0s elsewhere. This is the identity kernel, which leaves the image unchanged. Therefore, **H is correct**.

- **Option I**: A 3x3 matrix with 1s in the first and third columns and 0s elsewhere. Convolving with this kernel would modify the image, so **I is incorrect**.

- **Option J**: A 3x3 matrix with 1s in a checkerboard pattern. This kernel would combine neighboring pixel values, altering the image. Thus, **J is incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The only kernel that does not change the image is the identity kernel in **Option H**.
