Okay, so I've got this problem to solve about calculating the molecular weight of horse hemoglobin using some given data. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that there's a formula called the Stokes-Einstein equation, which relates the diffusion coefficient (D) to other properties of the molecule. The equation is D = k*T / (6πηr), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, η is the viscosity, and r is the radius of the molecule. But wait, the question might be using a different approach because they've given parameters like s, v, and rho. Oh right, I think I should be using the Svedberg equation instead. Svedberg's equation relates the sedimentation coefficient (s) to the molecular weight (M). 

The Svedberg equation is s = (M*(1 - vρ))/(N_A * D * 6πη)^(1/2) or something like that. Wait, no, maybe another version. Oh right, another formula for molecular weight combines the sedimentation coefficient and diffusion coefficient. Let me think. Oh yes, the formula is M = (s * N_A) / (D) * ( (1 - vρ) / (2) )^(-1/2) )? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the exact formula, but since I can't, I'll try to reconstruct it.

Wait, I think the correct Svedberg equation is M = (s * D * N_A) / ( (1 - vρ) * R * T ). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, there's another version where M is calculated using M = (s * R * T) / (D * (1 - vρ)) ) * (something). Oh wait, I think the formula is M = (s * R * T) / (D * (1 - vρ)) ) * (something with N_A?), but I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, let me think again. The Svedberg equation is M = (s * R * T) / (D * (1 - vρ)) ) * ( 1/(1 - ρ v) )? No, that seems off. Alternatively, the formula might be M = (s * N_A) / ( (D) * (1 - vρ) ) ). Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, I think the correct formula is M = (s * R * T) / (D * (1 - vρ)) ) * (1/(1 - vρ)) ). No, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps M = (s * R T) / (D * (1 - v ρ)) ) multiplied by Avogadro's number? Hmm, I'm getting myself more confused.

Wait, perhaps I should just write down all the given data and see how they fit into the equation.

Given data:
D = 6.3e-7 cm²/s
s = 4.41e-13 s (wait, that can't be right. Oh no, wait, s is the sedimentation coefficient, which is in units of svedbergs, but the given unit here is seconds. So maybe that's a typo. Oh, perhaps the unit is actually Svedberg, which is 1e-13 seconds. So s is 4.41 Svedbergs, which is 4.41e-13 s. So that's correct.

v = 0.749 cm³/g, which is the partial specific volume.
ρ = 0.9982 g/cm³, which is the density of the solution.
Temperature is 20°C, which is 293.15 K.

I think the formula I need is the Svedberg equation, which is:

M = (s * R * T) / (D * (1 - vρ)) ) * (1/(1 - vρ)) ?

Wait, no, perhaps the correct equation is:

M = (s * R T) / (D * (1 - v ρ)) ) * (something else). Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M = (s * N_A) / (D) * (something), but I'm not getting it right.

Wait, I remember that the Svedberg equation can be written as:

M = (s * D * N_A) / ( (1 - vρ) * R T )

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M = (s * R T) / (D (1 - vρ)) ) * (something). Oh, I think I might have the formula inverted. Let me try to think about the units. Molecular weight M has units of g/mol. Let's see:

s is in seconds (svedbergs = 1e-13 s), D is cm²/s, R is gas constant (maybe in erg/mol·K or similar), T in Kelvin, v is cm³/g, and rho is g/cm³. So (1 - v rho) is dimensionless, and D in cm²/s.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M = (s * R T) / (D (1 - v rho)) ). Let's plug in the units to check.

s: s
R: erg/mol·K
T: K
D: cm²/s
(1 - v rho) is unitless.

So the units would be:

s * (erg/mol·K) * K / (cm²/s) ) = s * erg/(mol·K) * K * s/cm²

The erg is g·cm²/s². So substituting:

s * (g·cm²/(s²·mol·K)) ) * K * s/cm²

Simplify:

s * (g·cm²/(s²·mol)) ) * s/cm² = (s * g·cm² * s) ) / (s²·mol·cm²) )

Wait, let's compute step by step:

The numerator in units: s * erg/(mol·K) * K = s * (g cm²/s²) / mol → (s * g cm²) / (s² mol) ) = g cm²/(s mol)

Denominator in units: D (cm²/s) → denominator is cm²/s, so when you divide, it's (g cm²/(s mol)) ) / (cm²/s) ) = (g cm² s) / (s mol cm²) ) → g/(mol)

Which is the unit for molecular weight. So the formula M = (s R T) / (D (1 - v rho)) ) would have the correct units. So that's probably the right formula.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Because I think the correct Svedberg equation is:

M = (s * R T) / ( D (1 - v ρ) ) 

But wait, I think I've forgotten Avogadro's number somewhere. Because R is the gas constant, which is N_A * k. So perhaps the correct formula includes N_A. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the equations.

Wait, another thought. The Svedberg equation is derived from combining sedimentation and diffusion data. The equation is:

M = ( s * R T ) / ( D (1 - v ρ) )

But wait, some sources mention that M = (s R T) / (D (1 - v rho)) ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's M = (s D R T) / ( (1 - v rho) * something else )

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the formula that uses the sedimentation coefficient (s), diffusion coefficient (D), and other terms. 

Wait, another approach: the formula for molecular weight can be derived from the equation:

s = ( M (1 - v ρ) ) / ( 6πη D )^(1/2) * ... No, perhaps it's better to look up the exact formula.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to write down the correct Svedberg equation. The formula is:

M = (s * R * T) / (D * (1 - v ρ)) ) * (1/(1 - v ρ)) )? No, that can’t be right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M = (s * D * R T) / ( (1 - v ρ)² ) ? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the Svedberg equation as:

s = ( ( M (1 - v ρ) ) / ( 6πη D ) )^(1/2) ) * (something else). No, I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, maybe the formula is M = (s * D * N_A) / ( (1 - v ρ) R T ). Let's check the units again.

s is in seconds, D is cm²/s, N_A is mol⁻¹, (1 - v rho) is unitless, R is erg/(mol·K), T is K.

So:

s * D = s * cm²/s = cm².

Multiply by N_A (mol⁻¹): cm² * mol⁻¹.

Divide by R T: (erg/(mol·K) ) * K ) → erg/mol.

So overall:

(cm² * mol⁻¹) / (erg/mol) ) = (cm² * mol⁻¹ * mol) / erg ) = cm² / erg.

But erg is g cm²/s², so cm²/(g cm²/s²) ) = s²/g.

That doesn't give g/mol, so perhaps that's not correct.

Hmm, maybe I should just accept that I can't remember the exact formula and proceed with the one I think is correct. Let me proceed with M = (s R T) / (D (1 - v ρ)).

So plugging in the numbers:

Given:
s = 4.41e-13 s (since 1 Svedberg is 1e-13 s)
D = 6.3e-7 cm²/s
v = 0.749 cm³/g
rho = 0.9982 g/cm³
T = 20°C = 293.15 K

R is the gas constant. Wait, what value of R should I use? Let me think. The gas constant R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is 8.314 m³·Pa/(mol·K), but I need to make sure the units are compatible. Alternatively, in cgs units, R is 8.314×10^7 erg/(mol·K) because 1 J = 10^7 erg. So R = 8.314e7 erg/(mol·K).

Now, compute 1 - v rho. v is 0.749 cm³/g, rho is 0.9982 g/cm³. So v rho = 0.749 * 0.9982 ≈ let's compute that.

0.749 * 0.9982 ≈ 0.749 * (1 - 0.0018) ≈ 0.749 - 0.749*0.0018 ≈ 0.749 - 0.001347 ≈ 0.74765. So 1 - 0.74765 = 0.25235.

Wait, wait, 0.749 * 0.9982: let me compute it accurately.

0.749 * 0.9982: Let's compute 0.7 * 0.9982 = 0.69874, 0.04 * 0.9982=0.039928, 0.009 *0.9982=0.0089818. Adding them up: 0.69874 + 0.039928 = 0.738668 + 0.0089818 = 0.7476498. So 1 - 0.7476498 = 0.2523502. Approximately 0.25235.

So 1 - v rho ≈ 0.25235.

Now, plug into the formula:

M = (s R T) / (D (1 - v rho)) )

Plugging the numbers:

s = 4.41e-13 s
R = 8.314e7 erg/(mol·K)
T = 293.15 K
D = 6.3e-7 cm²/s
(1 - v rho) = 0.25235

Compute numerator: s * R * T

s * R = 4.41e-13 s * 8.314e7 erg/(mol·K) → 4.41e-13 * 8.314e7 = let's compute that.

4.41e-13 * 8.314e7 = (4.41 * 8.314) * 1e-13+7 = 36.67 * 1e-6 = 3.667e-5.

Then multiply by T (293.15 K): 3.667e-5 * 293.15 ≈ ?

3.667e-5 * 293 ≈ 3.667e-5 * 2.9315e2 = 3.667 * 2.9315 * 1e-3.

3.667 * 2.9315 ≈ Let's compute:

3 * 2.9315 = 8.7945
0.667 * 2.9315 ≈ approx 1.954.
So total ≈ 8.7945 + 1.954 ≈ 10.7485.

So 10.7485e-3 → 0.0107485.

So numerator is approximately 0.0107485 erg·s/(mol).

Denominator: D * (1 - v rho) = 6.3e-7 cm²/s * 0.25235 → 6.3e-7 * 0.25235 ≈ 1.589005e-7 cm²/s.

So M = numerator / denominator = 0.0107485 / 1.589005e-7.

Compute 0.0107485 / 1.589005e-7 → Let's write 0.0107485 as 1.07485e-2.

So 1.07485e-2 / 1.589005e-7 = (1.07485 / 1.589005) * 1e5.

Compute 1.07485 / 1.589005 ≈ approx 0.6756.

So 0.6756 * 1e5 = 6.756e4 g/mol.

Wait, that's 67,560 g/mol. Looking at the options, option H is 67554, which is very close. So the calculation gives around 67,500, which matches H.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake in the steps.

Let me recalculate the numerator: s * R * T.

s = 4.41e-13 s
R = 8.314e7 erg/(mol·K)
T = 293.15 K

So s*R*T = 4.41e-13 * 8.314e7 * 293.15.

First compute 4.41e-13 * 8.314e7:

4.41e-13 * 8.314e7 = (4.41 * 8.314) * 1e-13+7 = 36.67 * 1e-6 = 3.667e-5.

Then multiply by T (293.15):

3.667e-5 * 293.15 = let's compute 3.667e-5 * 293.15.

3.667 * 293.15 ≈ 3.667 * 293 = let's compute 3 * 293 = 879, 0.667 * 293 ≈ 195.331. Total ≈ 879 + 195.331 = 1074.331.

So 3.667e-5 * 293.15 ≈ 1074.331e-5 → 0.01074331.

Denominator: D*(1 - v rho) = 6.3e-7 cm²/s * 0.25235.

6.3e-7 * 0.25235 = 6.3 * 0.25235 = 1.588605e-7.

So M = 0.01074331 / 1.588605e-7.

Compute 0.01074331 / 1.588605e-7 → 0.01074331 / 0.0000001588605 → Let me do this division.

Alternatively, write both in scientific notation:

Numerator: 1.074331e-2
Denominator: 1.588605e-7

So (1.074331e-2) / (1.588605e-7) ) = (1.074331 / 1.588605) * 1e5.

Compute 1.074331 / 1.588605. Let's do that division.

1.074331 ÷ 1.588605 ≈ 0.6755.

So 0.6755 * 1e5 = 6.755e4 → 67,550 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option H is 67554, which is very close. So that must be the answer.

To calculate the molecular weight of horse hemoglobin, the Svedberg equation is used:

\[
M = \frac{s \cdot R \cdot T}{D \cdot (1 - v \rho)}
\]

Where:
- \(s = 4.41 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{s}\) (sedimentation coefficient),
- \(R = 8.314 \times 10^7 \, \text{erg/(mol·K)}\) (gas constant in cgs units),
- \(T = 293.15 \, \text{K}\) (temperature in Kelvin),
- \(D = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{cm}^2/\text{s}\) (diffusion coefficient),
- \(v = 0.749 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{g}\) (partial specific volume),
- \(\rho = 0.9982 \, \text{g/cm}^3\) (density of the solution).

### Step 1: Calculate \(1 - v \rho\)
\[
v \rho = 0.749 \cdot 0.9982 = 0.74765
\]
\[
1 - v \rho = 1 - 0.74765 = 0.25235
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the numerator (\(s \cdot R \cdot T\))
\[
s \cdot R = 4.41 \times 10^{-13} \cdot 8.314 \times 10^7 = 3.667 \times 10^{-5}
