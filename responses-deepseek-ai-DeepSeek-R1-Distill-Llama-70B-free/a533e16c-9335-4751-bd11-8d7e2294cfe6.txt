Okay, so I've got this problem here about mixing benzene and iso-pentane. The conditions are 1.5 atm and 110°F. I need to find the liquid and vapor compositions using Raoult's law. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, I remember that Raoult's law applies to ideal solutions, and it states that the partial pressure of each component is equal to the mole fraction in the liquid multiplied by its pure vapor pressure at that temperature. So, P = x * P_pure for each component.

Wait, the problem gives me a total pressure of 1.5 atm. Since this is a mixture of two components, the total pressure would be the sum of the partial pressures of benzene and iso-pentane. So, P_total = P_B + P_P, where P_B is the partial pressure of benzene and P_P is that of iso-pentane.

But wait, I don't have the pure vapor pressures of benzene and iso-pentane at 110°F. Oh wait, maybe I can look that up or maybe they're given in a table somewhere. Oh wait, the problem must expect me to know or have the values. Maybe I should recall some approximate values.

I think at around 110°F (which is about 43.3°C), the vapor pressure of benzene is roughly around 0.5 atm? Or maybe higher? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. At 20°C, benzene's vapor pressure is around 0.12 atm. As temperature increases, vapor pressure increases. So 110°F is higher than 20°C. Let me see... I might be mixing up some numbers here. Alternatively, maybe I should remember a specific value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to know that at 110°F, the vapor pressure of benzene is about 2 atm, and iso-pentane is about 4 atm? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the vapor pressures are 1.5 atm each, but that might not add up.

Wait, maybe I should consider that if the total pressure is 1.5 atm, and both components are volatile, then their partial pressures would add up to 1.5 atm.

Alternatively, perhaps the vapor pressures at 110°F are such that benzene has a lower vapor pressure than iso-pentane. Because iso-pentane is a smaller molecule, it's more volatile, so higher vapor pressure.

Wait, I think I need to get the vapor pressures right. Let me try to recall or find approximate values.

After some thinking, I recall that benzene's vapor pressure at 100°F (about 37.8°C) is around 1.3 atm. At 110°F, maybe about 1.8 atm? Maybe I should use 1.8 atm for benzene. As for iso-pentane, which is 2-methylbutane, I think its vapor pressure is higher. Let me think; at 20°C, iso-pentane's vapor pressure is about 1.4 atm. At higher temperatures, it would be higher. So maybe 3.0 atm at 110°F? Or perhaps 2.5 atm.

Wait, but if the total pressure is 1.5 atm, and both components are present, then the sum of their partial pressures must equal 1.5 atm. So, each partial pressure is x_i * P_i^0, where x_i is the mole fraction in the liquid.

Wait, but the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures, which equals 1.5 atm. So, P_B = x_B * P_B0, P_P = x_P * P_P0. And x_B + x_P = 1, because it's a binary solution.

Wait, but without knowing the pure vapor pressures, I can't proceed. So perhaps the problem expects us to know or have these values. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that one of the components is much more volatile, so that the solution is dilute in one component.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is such that the solution is at the azeotropic point, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach. Let's suppose that the vapor pressures at 110°F are P_B0 = 1.5 atm and P_P0 = 3 atm. Let me check: if the total pressure is 1.5 atm, then the sum of the partial pressures is 1.5.

So, P_B = x_B * 1.5, P_P = (1 - x_B) * 3.0.

Adding these: x_B *1.5 + (1 - x_B)*3 = 1.5 atm.

Expanding: 1.5 x_B + 3 - 3 x_B = 1.5.

Combine like terms: (1.5 -3) x_B +3 =1.5 → (-1.5 x_B) +3 =1.5 → -1.5 x_B = -1.5 → x_B = 1.

Wait, that can't be right. If x_B =1, then P_B=1.5 atm, and P_P=0. But that would make the total pressure 1.5 atm, which fits, but that's just pure benzene.

Hmm, maybe my assumed vapor pressures are wrong. Perhaps I should pick different values. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps benzene has a lower vapor pressure than iso-pentane. Let's say at 110°F, P_B0 = 1 atm and P_P0 = 2 atm.

Then, P_total = x_B * 1 + x_P * 2 = (x_B + 2 x_P).

But x_B + x_P =1 → x_P = 1 - x_B.

So P_total = x_B *1 + (1 - x_B)*2 = x_B + 2 - 2 x_B = 2 - x_B.

We know P_total is 1.5 atm. So:

2 - x_B = 1.5 → x_B = 0.5.

So x_B=0.5, x_P=0.5.

Then, the partial pressures would be P_B=0.5 *1=0.5 atm, P_P=0.5 *2=1 atm.

Total is 1.5 atm, which matches.

So the liquid composition is x_B=0.5, x_P=0.5.

Now, for the vapor composition, we use y_i = P_i / P_total.

So y_B = 0.5 / 1.5 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333, y_P=1 /1.5 = 2/3 ≈ 0.666.

Looking at the options, let's see if any match x_B=0.5 and y_B= ~0.33.

Option E: x_B=0.5, x_P=0.5, y_B=0.2, y_P=0.8. Hmm, doesn't match.

Wait, so none of the options match. So perhaps my assumed vapor pressures are wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I should choose different vapor pressures. Let me try another set.

Suppose P_B0 = 2.0 atm, P_P0 = 4.0 atm.

Then P_total = x_B *2 + (1 -x_B)*4 = 2 x_B + 4 -4 x_B = 4 - 2 x_B.

Set equal to 1.5 atm: 4 -2 x_B =1.5 → 2 x_B = 2.5 → x_B=1.25. That's impossible because x can't be more than 1. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Maybe I have the vapor pressures the other way around. Let me assume P_B0 is higher than P_P0.

Wait, if benzene has a higher vapor pressure than iso-pentane, that would mean it's more volatile. But iso-pentane is a smaller molecule, so it's more volatile. So maybe my initial assumption about which has higher vapor pressure was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the vapor pressures at 110°F.

But since I'm just thinking through, let me try another approach. Suppose that at 110°F, P_B0 is 1.2 atm and P_P0 is 3.0 atm.

Then, P_total = x_B *1.2 + (1 -x_B)*3 =1.2 x_B +3 -3 x_B = 3 -1.8 x_B.

Set equal to 1.5:

3 -1.8 x_B = 1.5 → 1.8 x_B = 1.5 → x_B = 1.5 /1.8 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

So x_B=0.8333, x_P=0.1667.

Partial pressures: P_B=0.8333 *1.2 ≈1.0 atm, P_P=0.1667 *3≈0.5 atm.

Total 1.5 atm, correct.

Then vapor composition:

y_B=1.0 / 1.5≈0.6667, y_P=0.5/1.5≈0.3333.

Which would correspond to x_B=0.8333, y_B≈0.67.

Looking at the options, option J has x_B=0.25, y_B=0.4. No, not matching. Option A has x_B=0.15, y_B=0.25. No. Hmm.

Wait, none of the options seem to match the numbers I'm getting, so perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the solution is such that one component is more volatile, so the liquid is richer in the less volatile component, and the vapor richer in the more volatile.

So, suppose that iso-pentane is more volatile (higher vapor pressure), so in the liquid, x_P is lower, and in the vapor, y_P is higher.

Wait, the problem gives the total pressure, so perhaps using Raoult's law, we can set up the equations.

Let me denote:

x_B = mole fraction of benzene in liquid.

x_P = 1 - x_B.

Pure vapor pressures:

P_B0 = vapor pressure of pure benzene at 110°F.

P_P0 = vapor pressure of pure iso-pentane at 110°F.

Partial pressures:

P_B = x_B * P_B0.

P_P = x_P * P_P0.

Total pressure P = P_B + P_P =1.5 atm.

So,

x_B * P_B0 + (1 - x_B) * P_P0 = 1.5.

We can solve for x_B:

x_B (P_B0 - P_P0) + P_P0 = 1.5.

x_B = (1.5 - P_P0) / (P_B0 - P_P0).

But without knowing P_B0 and P_P0, I can't compute x_B.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to know that at 110°F, P_B0 is 1.5 atm and P_P0 is 3 atm. Let me try that.

So,

x_B = (1.5 -3)/(1.5-3) = (-1.5)/(-1.5) = 1. So x_B=1, which would mean pure benzene. But then the vapor would be pure benzene as well. But the options don't have x_B=1.

Alternatively, perhaps P_B0 is 3 atm and P_P0 is 1.5 atm. Then,

x_B = (1.5 -1.5)/(3 -1.5) → 0/1.5 = 0. So x_B=0, x_P=1. Which would make the solution pure iso-pentane, but that's not in the options either.

Hmm, perhaps I should instead think that the vapor pressures sum in a way that allows a solution between 0 and 1.

Wait, maybe I should use the Antoine equation to estimate the vapor pressures. But that's complicated without specific constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to know that at 110°F, the vapor pressures are such that when mixed, the total pressure is 1.5 atm, leading to a certain composition.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see which ones make sense.

Option B: x_B=0.10, x_P=0.90. So, if P_B0 is higher than P_P0, then the more volatile component is benzene, but that would mean the vapor is richer in benzene.

Wait, but in option B, y_B=0.15, which is higher than x_B=0.10. So the vapor is richer in benzene than the liquid, which would mean benzene is more volatile.

But if benzene is more volatile, then P_B0 > P_P0.

Wait, let's try using the numbers from Option B.

Assume x_B=0.10, x_P=0.90.

P_total = 0.1 * P_B0 + 0.9 * P_P0 =1.5.

And the vapor composition y_B = (0.1 P_B0 ) / 1.5.

In option B, y_B=0.15, so 0.1 P_B0 /1.5 = 0.15 → 0.1 P_B0 =0.225 → P_B0=2.25 atm.

Then, substituting back into P_total:

0.1 *2.25 + 0.9 * P_P0 =1.5.

0.225 + 0.9 P_P0 =1.5 → 0.9 P_P0=1.275 → P_P0=1.4167 atm.

So if benzene has a higher vapor pressure (2.25 atm) than iso-pentane (1.4167 atm), then that makes sense. So this would imply that benzene is more volatile, leading to a higher concentration in the vapor.

Wait, but wait, iso-pentane is a smaller molecule, so it's usually more volatile than benzene. So maybe the vapor pressures I'm using are swapped.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming which is more volatile. Let me double-check.

Benzene's normal boiling point is about 80°C, while iso-pentane's is around -58°C. So iso-pentane is more volatile; it has a higher vapor pressure at a given temperature. So at 110°F (43.3°C), iso-pentane's vapor pressure should be higher than benzene's.

So in that case, P_P0 > P_B0.

Wait, but in option B, the calculated P_B0 is 2.25 atm, and P_P0 is 1.4167 atm, which would imply benzene is more volatile. That contradicts the boiling points.

So perhaps option B is incorrect.

Let me try another option. Let's take option D: x_B=0.30, x_P=0.70. y_B=0.02, y_P=0.98.

Wait, if y_B is 0.02, that's much lower than x_B=0.30. That would imply that the vapor is depleted in benzene, so benzene is less volatile. Which aligns with iso-pentane being more volatile.

So, let's compute the partial pressures.

P_total = x_B P_B0 + x_P P_P0 =1.5 atm.

And y_B = (x_B P_B0) /1.5 =0.02 → x_B P_B0 =0.03.

So if x_B=0.30, then 0.30 P_B0=0.03 → P_B0=0.1 atm.

Then, substituting into P_total:

0.30 *0.1 +0.70 * P_P0 =1.5 → 0.03 +0.7 P_P0=1.5 → 0.7 P_P0=1.47 → P_P0≈2.1 atm.

So iso-pentane's vapor pressure is higher than benzene's, which makes sense.

So in this case, with P_B0=0.1 atm and P_P0=2.1 atm, and x_B=0.3, we get y_B=0.02, which matches option D.

But wait, I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me check another option.

Option H: x_B=0.13, x_P=0.87, y_B=0.02, y_P=0.98.

So, y_B = (x_B P_B0) / P_total → 0.02 = (0.13 P_B0)/1.5 → 0.13 P_B0=0.03 → P_B0≈0.2308 atm.

Then, P_total = 0.13 *0.2308 +0.87 * P_P0 =1.5.

0.03 + 0.87 P_P0 =1.5 → 0.87 P_P0=1.47 → P_P0≈1.69 atm.

Which is higher than benzene's, which makes sense.

But then, what's the right option?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that when the solution is such that the total pressure is 1.5 atm, and given that iso-pentane is more volatile, the liquid will be rich in benzene (the less volatile component), and the vapor rich in iso-pentane.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H has x_B=0.13, which is lower than y_B=0.02. Wait, no, y_B is 0.02, which is lower than x_B=0.13. That would imply that the vapor is less rich in benzene than the liquid, which can't be right because if benzene is less volatile, the liquid should have more benzene, and the vapor less.

Wait, that makes sense. So in option H, x_B=0.13, y_B=0.02. So liquid has 13% benzene, vapor has 2% benzene. That fits because benzene is less volatile, so vapor is mostly iso-pentane.

But earlier, when I used the numbers from option D, I got P_B0=0.1, which seems low for benzene's vapor pressure at 110°F.

Perhaps I should look for an option where x_B is low and y_B is even lower. Let me check option H.

In option H, x_B=0.13, y_B=0.02.

So, using Raoult's law:

P_B = x_B * P_B0.

P_P = x_P * P_P0.

P_total = P_B + P_P =1.5 atm.

And y_B = P_B / P_total.

So,

y_B = (x_B P_B0) / (x_B P_B0 + x_P P_P0) = 0.02.

Let me plug
