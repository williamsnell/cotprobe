Question:

A state legislature passed a law requiring state universities to have male and female students live in separate dormitory facilities. The law was passed in order to curtail the increasing number of co-ed pregnancies on college campuses. Two students at a state university are engaged to be married and wish to share a dormitory room together. Citing the law, university housing officials refuse to allow them to live together in a campus dormitory facility. The students bring an appropriate action to challenge the constitutionality of the law. Which of the following correctly states the applicable burden of persuasion?

Options:

A: Since the law does not affect a fundamental right or involve gender discrimination, the burden is on the plaintiffs to show that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.
B: Since the law deals with the fundamental right of privacy, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.
C: Since the law involves marital discrimination, the state must prove that the law is substantially related to an important state interest.
D: Since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.
E: Since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must prove that the law is substantially related to an important state interest.
F: Since the law deals with the freedom of association, the burden is on the plaintiffs to prove that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.
G: Since the law deals with the freedom of association, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.
H: Since the law involves privacy rights, the burden is on the plaintiffs to prove that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.
I: Since the law affects the fundamental right to education, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.
J: Since the law does not affect a fundamental right or involve marital discrimination, the burden is on the plaintiffs to show that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this constitutional law question, and honestly, it's a bit tricky for me. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a state legislature passing a law that requires state universities to have separate dorms for male and female students. The reason given is to reduce the number of co-ed pregnancies on campus. Now, there are two students who are engaged and want to share a dorm room, but the university won't let them because of this law. They're challenging the law's constitutionality, and the question is about the burden of persuasion in this case.

Alright, so I remember that in constitutional law, the level of scrutiny applied depends on what right is being affected and whether the law is infringing on it. The main levels of scrutiny are rational basis, intermediate scrutiny, and strict scrutiny.

First, I need to figure out what fundamental rights are at play here. The students are engaged and want to live together, so I think this relates to privacy and maybe marital rights. The right to privacy is a fundamental right under the Constitution, as established in cases like Griswold v. Connecticut. But wait, in this case, the students are engaged but not yet married. Hmm, does that affect anything? Also, the law is about housing based on gender, so could that involve gender discrimination?

Wait, the law requires separate dorms for male and female students, regardless of marital status. So, the students here are a male and a female who are engaged and want to live together. The university is citing the law to prevent them. So the issue is whether the state can enforce this separation based on gender, even for engaged couples.

Now, thinking about the rights involved: privacy, which includes personal autonomy in decisions regarding marriage and living arrangements. Also, the right to marry is a fundamental right, but these students are already engaged, so maybe they're about to get married, but not yet. But I think the right to privacy includes the right to make decisions about who to live with, especially in the context of being engaged, which is a step towards marriage.

Alternatively, the law could be seen as gender-based discrimination because it's separating housing based on sex. So that might trigger intermediate scrutiny if the law is based on gender. But wait, the law applies equally to all students, not just one gender, so maybe it's not gender discrimination in the traditional sense. Or is it? Because it's treating males and females differently in terms of housing.

Wait, gender discrimination cases usually involve treating one gender differently than the other, which this law does. So perhaps the law is based on gender, which would mean that the state has to meet a higher burden, like intermediate scrutiny.

So, when a law discriminates based on gender, the court applies intermediate scrutiny. That means the state must show that the law is substantially related to an important governmental interest. If the law infringes on a fundamental right, then strict scrutiny applies, requiring a compelling interest.

But in this case, is the law infringing on a fundamental right? The right to privacy, perhaps. Or the right to marry. The Supreme Court has held that the right to marry is a fundamental right, so laws that substantially interfere with that are subject to strict scrutiny. But in this case, the students are engaged but not yet married. Are they being prevented from marrying? Or just from living together before marriage? Hmm.

Wait, the law is about dormitories, not about marriage licenses. So perhaps it's more about privacy and the right to choose where to live. The right to privacy in this context includes personal autonomy in making decisions about one's living arrangements, especially concerning intimate relationships. So maybe the law is infringing on their privacy rights.

Alternatively, another angle is the right to equal protection under the law. If the law discriminates based on gender, then the state must have an important interest and the law must be substantially related to achieving that interest.

Wait, but the law doesn't explicitly discriminate against one gender; it's separating males and females. So perhaps it's a form of sex-based classification. Let me think: in cases like United States v. Virginia, the Supreme Court struck down the Virginia Military Institute's male-only admission policy because it failed intermediate scrutiny. So sex-based laws are subject to intermediate scrutiny.

So the law here is a sex-based classification because it separates housing based on gender. Therefore, the state would have to prove that the law is substantially related to an important governmental interest.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option E says: Since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must prove that the law is substantially related to an important state interest. That sounds like intermediate scrutiny, which is correct for gender-based laws.

Option D says the state must show a compelling interest, which would be strict scrutiny. But I think gender discrimination is intermediate scrutiny, not strict. So D is probably wrong.

Option C mentions marital discrimination. I'm not sure if that's a separate category. I think marital status can be a factor, but in this case, the law isn't targeting marital status; it's about gender. The students are engaged but not married, and the law applies regardless of marital status. So maybe C is not the right approach.

Option B mentions the fundamental right of privacy and says the state must show a compelling interest. If the right to privacy is a fundamental right, then strict scrutiny applies. So if the law infringes on privacy, then yes, it's strict scrutiny. But is the law infringing on privacy here?

The students are being prevented from living together in a dorm, but are engaged. So maybe their privacy right to cohabitate is being affected. But I'm not sure if the court would consider this a fundamental right in this context. The right to marry includes the right to cohabitate after marriage, but they're not married yet. So perhaps the privacy right here is more about personal autonomy, but I'm not sure if that's considered a fundamental right in the same way as marriage.

Alternatively, if the law is based on gender, then it's a gender discrimination issue, leading to intermediate scrutiny. So, which applies here?

Wait, the Supreme Court in cases like Lawrence v. Texas has recognized that private sexual conduct is part of the liberty interest under the due process clause, which is a fundamental right. So perhaps the right to make decisions about one's living arrangements with a partner is part of that privacy right. If that's the case, then the law would trigger strict scrutiny.

But in this scenario, the students are not married, so maybe the court is less likely to apply strict scrutiny. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

The law requires separate dorms for males and females. So it's a sex-based classification. Therefore, under equal protection, it's subject to intermediate scrutiny. The state must show that the law is substantially related to an important governmental interest. So the burden is on the state to meet intermediate scrutiny.

Looking back at the options, option E states that since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must prove the law is substantially related to an important interest. That fits.

But wait, another thought: the question is about the burden of persuasion. So in equal protection cases based on gender, the plaintiff must prove that the law is based on gender, which they would do, and then the state must show that the law meets intermediate scrutiny.

So the options are about who has the burden. The question is, which option correctly states the applicable burden of persuasion.

So if the law is a gender-based classification, then the state bears the burden of proving that the law is substantially related to an important government interest. That's option E.

Alternatively, if the law implicates a fundamental right, then the state would have the burden under strict scrutiny. So which is it here?

I think the key is whether the law affects a fundamental right. The students are engaged, so perhaps they have a fundamental right to marry, but they're not married yet. The right to marry includes the right to cohabitate after marriage, but I'm not sure if being engaged and wanting to live together before marriage is part of that.

In Turner v. Safley, the Supreme Court considered a law that prohibited prisoners from marrying. The court applied strict scrutiny because the right to marry is fundamental. But that's in the context of prisoners, and the court found that the regulation was not narrowly tailored.

In this case, the students are not being prohibited from marrying, just from living together in the dorm. So maybe the right to marry isn't directly at issue, but the right to privacy is.

Alternatively, perhaps the law doesn't implicate a fundamental right, so rational basis applies, but I don't think so because gender is involved.

Wait, the law is a gender classification, so regardless of whether a fundamental right is implicated, it's subject to at least intermediate scrutiny. So the burden is on the state to show substantial relation to an important interest.

So looking back at the options, E seems correct. So the applicable burden is that the state must prove the law is substantially related to an important interest.

So the correct answer should be E.

The question involves a state law requiring separate dormitories for male and female students at state universities, enacted to reduce co-ed pregnancies. Two engaged students challenge the law after being denied the opportunity to share a dorm room. The issue centers on the applicable burden of persuasion in assessing the law's constitutionality.

To determine the correct burden, it is essential to identify the rights and classifications at play. The law separates housing based on gender, which constitutes a sex-based classification under equal protection analysis. Sex-based classifications trigger intermediate scrutiny, requiring the state to prove that the law is substantially related to an important governmental interest. 

While the students' situation could raise privacy concerns, the law does not directly infringe on a fundamental right like marriage or privacy in a way that would require strict scrutiny. Instead, the primary issue is gender discrimination, as the law treats males and females differently in housing. Therefore, the state must satisfy intermediate scrutiny by showing the law is substantially related to an important interest.

Among the options, **E** correctly states that since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must prove that the law is substantially related to an important state interest. This aligns with the intermediate scrutiny standard applicable to sex-based classifications.

**Answer: E**
