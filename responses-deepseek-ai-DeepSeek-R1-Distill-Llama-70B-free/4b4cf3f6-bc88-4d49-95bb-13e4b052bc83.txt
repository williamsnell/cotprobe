Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a pendulum and its period changing when moved from London to Paris. Hmm, I remember that the period of a pendulum depends on the acceleration due to gravity, right? Let me think about this.

The problem says the pendulum has a period of 1 second in London where g is 32.200 ft/s². Then it's taken to Paris and it loses 20 seconds per day. Wait, losing time means it's running slow, so the period must be longer in Paris. Or wait, no, if it's losing time, maybe it's going faster? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the period is the time for one complete swing. So if the period increases, the pendulum is swinging slower, meaning it's taking more time per swing. So if it's losing 20 seconds per day, that suggests that in Paris, each day (which is 24*60*60 = 86400 seconds) it's behind by 20 seconds. So the total time measured would be less than the actual, which implies the pendulum is running slow. Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up here.

Wait, let's think differently. Let's say in London, the pendulum is accurate because it was set there. So when taken to Paris, it loses time. So in London, it's keeping correct time (1 sec per period), but in Paris, it's not. So the period in Paris must be different.

Wait, the formula for the period of a pendulum is T = 2π√(L/g), right? Where L is the length of the pendulum and g is the acceleration due to gravity. So the period depends on the square root of L/g. Since the pendulum is the same when moved, the length L doesn't change. So the change in period is due to the change in g.

In London, T1 is 1 second, and g1 is 32.200 ft/s². In Paris, the period T2 will be different because g2 is different. The pendulum is losing 20 seconds per day in Paris.

Wait, but a day has 86400 seconds. If the pendulum is losing 20 seconds per day, that means that for each real day (86400 seconds), the pendulum only counts 86400 - 20 = 86380 seconds? Or does it mean that the pendulum's time is longer? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me think about it this way: if the pendulum's period is longer in Paris, then it would take more time per swing. So if you have a certain number of swings, the total time measured by the pendulum would be more than the actual time. But in the problem, it says the pendulum loses time, so perhaps it's actually running slow. Wait, no, that contradicts. Let me clarify.

Suppose the pendulum in London has a period T1 = 1 s. So in 86400 seconds (one day), it would swing 86400 times. Now, when it's taken to Paris, due to a different g, its period becomes T2. Let’s say that in Paris, the pendulum completes fewer cycles than it should in a day, causing it to lose time.

Wait, no. Because if the period in Paris is longer, then in real time (like one day), the pendulum would have made fewer oscillations. So the number of ticks (each tick being one period) would be less than 86400, which would make the pendulum think less time has passed. So the pendulum would show a time that's less than a real day. But the problem says it loses 20 seconds per day, which I think refers to the real time. Hmm, maybe it's better to model it with the periods.

Alternatively, the total time the pendulum measures in a day would be T2 multiplied by the number of periods it does. But perhaps it's easier to calculate the difference in the period.

Wait, another approach: The pendulum's period in Paris is T2. The real time in a day is 86400 seconds. So the number of periods the pendulum goes through in a day is 86400 / T2. But the pendulum's own time would be (number of periods) * T2. Wait, that can't be right because that would just give 86400, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm complicating things.

Let me think again. The pendulum is supposed to tick once per second in London (T1=1 s). When it's taken to Paris, each tick now takes T2 seconds. So in real time t, the pendulum will have ticks at every T2 seconds. So the number of ticks in time t is t / T2. But the correct number of ticks should have been t / T1.

The problem states that in Paris, the pendulum loses 20 seconds per day. So over 86400 seconds of real time, the pendulum's time is 86400 - 20 = 86380 seconds. So the number of ticks is 86380 / T1 = 86380.

But the actual number of ticks, based on T2, is 86400 / T2. So 86400 / T2 = 86380.

Wait, that would mean T2 = 86400 / 86380 ≈ 1.00023256 seconds. So the period in Paris is longer than in London, meaning that g is smaller because T increases when g decreases.

Wait, that makes sense because if g decreases, the pendulum swings more slowly, so the period increases.

So now, using the formula T = 2π√(L/g), we can relate the periods and the gravities.

In London: T1 = 1 s = 2π√(L/g1)
In Paris: T2 = (86400 / 86380) ≈ 1.00023256 s = 2π√(L/g2)

Dividing T2 by T1, we get T2/T1 = sqrt(g1/g2). Because the L is same.

So, (1.00023256) / 1 = sqrt(g1/g2)

Squaring both sides: (1.00023256)^2 ≈ g1/g2

So, g2 = g1 / (1.00023256)^2

Calculating that, let's see:

First, compute (1.00023256)^2. Let's approximate:

Approximate 1.00023256^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.00023256) + (0.00023256)^2 ≈ 1 + 0.00046512 + 0.000000054 ≈ 1.00046517

So, g2 ≈ 32.200 / 1.00046517 ≈ ?

Let me compute that division.

32.200 divided by approximately 1.000465.

Let's compute 32.200 * (1 / 1.000465) ≈ 32.200 * (0.999535) ≈ ?

Wait, 1/1.000465 ≈ 0.999535 (since 1.000465 ≈ 1 + 0.000465, so reciprocal ≈ 1 - 0.000465 )

So 32.200 * 0.999535 ≈ ?

32.2 * 0.999535.

Let me compute 32.2 * 0.999535.

0.999535 is approximately 1 - 0.000465, so 32.2 * (1 - 0.000465) = 32.2 - (32.2 * 0.000465)

Compute 32.2 * 0.000465:

32.2 * 0.0004 = 0.01288

32.2 * 0.000065 = 0.002093

Total: 0.01288 + 0.002093 ≈ 0.014973

So 32.2 - 0.014973 ≈ 32.185027 ft/s².

Looking at the options, option D is 32.185 ft/s², which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation because I might have made a mistake in the approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the exact delta.

Wait, 86400 seconds is the real time. The number of periods in real time is 86400 / T2.

The pendulum's time is (number of periods) * T1 = (86400 / T2) * 1 = 86400 / T2.

But the actual time is 86400, so the pendulum's time is 86400 / T2.

But the problem states that the pendulum loses 20 seconds, so its time is 86400 - 20 = 86380.

So, 86400 / T2 = 86380 → T2 = 86400 / 86380 ≈ 1.00023256 s.

So the period in Paris is 1.00023256 s.

Then, T2 = 2π√(L/g2), and T1 = 2π√(L/g1).

Dividing, T2/T1 = sqrt(g1/g2) → (1.00023256) = sqrt(32.200 / g2).

Squaring both sides: 1.000465 ≈ 32.200 / g2 → g2 ≈ 32.200 / 1.000465 ≈ 32.185.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is D.

To determine the value of \( g \) in Paris, we start with the formula for the period of a pendulum:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}
\]

where \( T \) is the period, \( L \) is the length of the pendulum, and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. Since the pendulum's length \( L \) remains constant, the period depends only on \( g \).

### Step 1: Relating periods and gravities
In London, the period is \( T_1 = 1 \, \text{s} \), and \( g_1 = 32.200 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \). In Paris, the period changes to \( T_2 \), and we need to find \( g_2 \). The relationship between the periods and gravities is given by:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{g_1}{g_2}}
\]

Rearranging for \( g_2 \):

\[
g_2 = g_1 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^2
\]

### Step 2: Determining \( T_2 \)
The pendulum loses 20 seconds per day in Paris. A day has \( 86400 \, \text{s} \), so the total time measured by the pendulum in Paris is:

\[
\text{Pendulum's time} = 86400 - 20 = 86380 \, \text{s}
\]

The number of periods in one day is:

\[
\text{Number of periods} = \frac{\text{Real time}}{\text{Period}} = \frac{86400}{T_2}
\]

The pendulum's time is also equal to the number of periods multiplied by its own period \( T_1 \):

\[
\text{Pendulum's time} = \left(\frac{86400}{T_2}\right) \cdot T_1
\]

Equating the two expressions for the pendulum's time:

\[
\frac{86400}{T_2} \cdot T_1 = 86380
\]

Solving for \( T_2 \):

\[
T_2 = \frac{86400 \cdot T_1}{86380}
\]

Substituting \( T_1 = 1 \, \text{s} \):

\[
T_2 = \frac{86400}{86380} \approx 1.00023256 \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculating \( g_2 \)
Using the formula \( g_2 = g_1 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^2 \), substitute \( g_1 = 32.200 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \), \( T_1 = 1 \, \text{s} \), and \( T_2 \approx 1.00023256 \, \text{s} \):

\[
g_2 = 32.200 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{1.00023256}\right)^2
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{1}{1.00023256} \approx 0.99976744 \), and then square it:

\[
\left(0.99976744\right)^2 \approx 0.99953488
\]

Now multiply:

\[
g_2 = 32.200 \cdot 0.99953488 \approx 32.185 \, \text{ft/s}^2
\]

### Final Answer
The value of \( g \) in Paris is approximately \( 32.185 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \), which corresponds to option **D**.
