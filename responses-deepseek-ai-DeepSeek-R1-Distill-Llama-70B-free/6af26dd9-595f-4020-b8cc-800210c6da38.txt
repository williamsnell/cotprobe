Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about Lewis structures and unpaired electrons. Hmm, I remember that Lewis structures are diagrams that show the bonding between atoms of a molecule and the lone pairs of electrons that may exist. They help us understand the structure of molecules.

The question says: "Substances whose Lewis structures must be drawn with an unpaired electron are called..." and then there are the options from A to J.

Wait, I need to think about what an unpaired electron implies. Lewis structures typically show all the valence electrons. If an atom has an unpaired electron, it means it doesn't have a full octet, right? Or maybe it's part of a molecule where electrons aren't all paired.

Oh right, free radicals come to mind. Free radicals are species with unpaired electrons. They're usually pretty reactive because they seek to gain or lose electrons to achieve a stable configuration. So if a substance's Lewis structure has an unpaired electron, that's a free radical.

Looking at the options, option B is free radicals. So the answer should be B.

But wait, let me go through the other options just to make sure I'm not making a mistake.

Option A: Hydrogen bonds. Those are a type of intermolecular force, not related to unpaired electrons in Lewis structures. So A isn't right.

Option C: Allotropes. Those are different structural forms of the same element, like diamond and graphite for carbon. They don't inherently have unpaired electrons unless the specific form does, but that's not the general case. So C isn't the right category here.

Option D: Isotopes. These are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. They have the same electronic structure, so their Lewis structures would be the same as the base element. No unpaired electrons unless the element itself has them, but that's not about isotopes. So D is out.

Option E: Nonpolar molecules. These have symmetrical charge distribution. Their Lewis structures might have lone pairs but not necessarily unpaired electrons. But wait, like O2 has a double bond and each O has two unpaired electrons in the ground state. Oh, wait, but O2 is a diradical. So maybe some nonpolar molecules are free radicals. But the term nonpolar refers to the distribution of electrons, not the presence of unpaired electrons. So E isn't the correct category for the question.

Option F: Polar molecules. These have a net dipole moment because of asymmetrical charge distribution. But again, their Lewis structures can have lone pairs, but not necessarily unpaired electrons. So F isn't it.

Option G: Covalent compounds. These involve sharing electrons. Lewis structures for them usually show all electrons paired, unless it's a radical. So G is too broad and doesn't specifically refer to unpaired electrons.

Option H: Resonance structures. These are different Lewis structures that show the delocalization of electrons in a molecule. They don't necessarily involve unpaired electrons unless the molecule is a radical. So H isn't the answer.

Option I: Dipole moments. This is about the separation of charges in a molecule. Again, not about unpaired electrons. So I isn't it.

Option J: Ionic compounds. These involve the transfer of electrons, leading to ions. Their Lewis structures would show the transfer, but not necessarily unpaired electrons unless the ion itself has them. But ionic compounds are more about complete transfer, so J isn't the right choice.

So yep, the correct answer is B: free radicals.

The question asks about substances whose Lewis structures must be drawn with an unpaired electron. Lewis structures represent the valence electrons of atoms in a molecule, and an unpaired electron indicates that an atom does not have a full octet of electrons. Free radicals are defined as species with unpaired electrons, making them inherently reactive as they seek to gain or lose electrons to achieve stability. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Hydrogen bonds** are intermolecular forces and unrelated to unpaired electrons.  
- **B: Free radicals** are species with unpaired electrons, fitting the description.  
- **C: Allotropes** are structural forms of an element and do not inherently involve unpaired electrons.  
- **D: Isotopes** vary in neutrons, not electrons, so they do not affect Lewis structures.  
- **E: Nonpolar molecules** refer to symmetry in electron distribution, not unpaired electrons.  
- **F: Polar molecules** involve asymmetrical charge distribution, not necessarily unpaired electrons.  
- **G: Covalent compounds** typically involve paired electrons unless they are radicals.  
- **H: Resonance structures** show electron delocalization but do not inherently involve unpaired electrons.  
- **I: Dipole moments** relate to charge separation, not unpaired electrons.  
- **J: Ionic compounds** involve electron transfer, not necessarily unpaired electrons.  

The correct answer is **B: free radicals**, as they are specifically defined by having unpaired electrons in their Lewis structures.

Answer: B
