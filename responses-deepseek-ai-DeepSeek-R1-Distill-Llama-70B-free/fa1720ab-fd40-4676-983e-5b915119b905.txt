Okay, so I've got this question about bonds, right? Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, a bond yielding 5% interest pays annual interest of $2.50. I need to find the face value of the bond.

Wait, I remember that the interest from a bond is usually calculated as a percentage of its face value. Oh right, the formula is something like Interest = (Face Value × Rate) / Time. But since the interest here is annual, I guess the Time part is 1 year, so it simplifies to Interest = Face Value × Rate.

So the rate is 5%, which is like 5 per 100, so 0.05 in decimal. The interest paid each year is $2.50. So plugging into the formula: 2.50 = Face Value × 0.05. 

Wait, I need to solve for Face Value. So I'll rearrange the formula. Face Value = Interest / Rate. That makes sense. So Face Value equals 2.50 divided by 0.05.

Let me do the math. 2.50 divided by 0.05. Hmm, 0.05 is the same as 5 hundredths, so dividing by 0.05 is the same as multiplying by 20. Because 1/0.05 is 20. So 2.50 × 20 = 50. Oh, so the face value is $50.

Looking at the options, option D is $50. So the answer should be D.

To determine the face value of the bond, we use the formula for simple interest:

\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Face Value} \times \text{Rate}
\]

Given that the annual interest is $2.50 and the rate is 5% (or 0.05 in decimal form), we can rearrange the formula to solve for the face value:

\[
\text{Face Value} = \frac{\text{Interest}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{2.50}{0.05} = 50
\]

Thus, the face value of the bond is $50. From the options provided, the correct answer is:

D: $50

Answer: D
