Okay, so I have this DNA question in front of me. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my DNA replication, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me a single strand of DNA: 5' - AAAT C G A TTG C G C T A T C G - 3'. I need to find the complementary sequence that would pair with this during replication. I remember that DNA is antiparallel, so the complementary strand runs in the opposite direction.

Wait, right, DNA strands are complementary and antiparallel. So the given strand is 5' to 3', which means the complementary strand should be 3' to 5'. Oh wait, no, during replication, the new strand is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction. So the complementary strand would be built in the opposite direction.

Let me break it down. The original strand is 5' to 3', so the complementary should be 3' to 5' when considering the double helix. But when writing the complementary sequence, I think we write it 5' to 3' as well, but complementary and reversed.

Wait, wait, no. Let's think. If the given strand is 5' → 3', the complementary strand must run 3' → 5' to pair with it. So to construct the complementary sequence, I need to reverse the order of the given strand and then take the complement of each nucleotide.

So the given strand is:

5' - A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G - 3'

I should write the complementary strand from 3' to 5', so the sequence would be the reverse complement.

Let me reverse the given sequence first. Let's write it backwards.

Original sequence: A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G

Reversed: G C T A T G C G T G A T C G A A A

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original is 5' to 3' as written. So the complementary strand is built in the 5' to 3' direction, but it's the reverse complement.

Let me write the sequence in order, then reverse it and take the complement.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to go step by step.

Let me write the given strand as a string, breaking it into parts for clarity.

The given strand is divided as: AAAT C G A TTG C G C T A T C G

Wait, perhaps it's written without the spaces. Maybe the spaces are just for readability. So the actual sequence is AAATCGATTGCGCTATCG.

Wait, perhaps I should just ignore the spaces and read it as a continuous string.

So the given is: 5' - A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G -3'

So the entire sequence is: A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G

Wait, I can write it as:

5' - A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G - 3'

So the complementary strand will pair with this. Each nucleotide pairs as A-T, T-A, C-G, G-C.

So to get the complementary strand, I take each nucleotide in reverse order and replace it with its complement.

So let me write the sequence in reverse order first.

Original sequence (5' to 3'): A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G

Wait, no, the actual letters are in order from 5' to 3', so when reversed, it's 3' to 5'.

Wait, maybe it's easier to write each nucleotide and then reverse the list.

Let me list each nucleotide in order from 5' to 3' (as given):

1. A
2. A
3. A
4. T
5. C
6. G
7. A
8. T
9. T
10. G
11. C
12. G
13. C
14. T
15. A
16. T
17. C
18. G

So the sequence is 18 nucleotides long. Now, to get the complementary strand, I need to:

1. Reverse the order of the nucleotides.
2. Take the complement of each nucleotide (A→T, T→A, C→G, G→C).

So reversing the order gives me:

G, C, T, A, T, G, C, G, T, T, A, G, C, T, A, A, A.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, let me list them in original order, then reverse, then take the complement.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the original as 5' to 3', then the complementary would be 3' to 5', so when written as 5' to 3', it's the reverse complement.

So, let's take each nucleotide, starting from the 3' end of the original (which is the last nucleotide in the given sequence) and go backward.

The given ends with G at the 3' end. So the complementary strand starts with C at its 5' end.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write each nucleotide in reverse order and then take their complement.

Let me try to write the original sequence from 5' to 3' as a list:

[ A, A, A, T, C, G, A, T, T, G, C, G, C, T, A, T, C, G ]

Now, reverse this list:

[ G, C, T, A, T, G, C, G, T, T, A, G, C, T, A, A, A ]

Wait, no, wait. The reversed list would be the order from last to first.

So the reversed list is:

G (18th), C (17th), T (16th), A (15th), T (14th), G (13th), C (12th), G (11th), C (10th?), wait no.

Wait, let me index the positions correctly.

Original list (indices 1-18):

1: A
2: A
3: A
4: T
5: C
6: G
7: A
8: T
9: T
10: G
11: C
12: G
13: C
14: T
15: A
16: T
17: C
18: G

So when reversed, the order is 18,17,16,...1.

So reversed list:

18: G → position 1 in reversed
17: C → position 2
16: T → 3
15: A →4
14: T →5
13: C →6
12: G →7
11: C →8
10: G →9
9: T →10
8: T →11
7: A →12
6: G →13
5: C →14
4: T →15
3: A →16
2: A →17
1: A →18

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me write the reversed sequence of the given.

Original: 5' A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G 3'

Reversed: 3' G C T A T G C G C T T G A T C G A A A 5'

Wait, that's the reversed sequence. Now, to get the complement, each nucleotide is replaced by its complement.

So, replacing each in the reversed sequence:

G → C
C → G
T → A
A → T
T → A
G → C
C → G
G → C
C → G
T → A
T → A
G → C
A → T
T → A
C → G
G → C
A → T
A → T
A → T

Wait, no, the reversed sequence is G C T A T G C G C T T G A T C G A A A.

Wait, let me do it step by step.

Reversed sequence (from 3' to 5') is:

G C T A T G C G C T T G A T C G A A A

Wait, but actually, the reversed sequence is the original read backward. So taking the original 5' to 3' and reading it backward gives the 3' to 5' of the complementary strand.

So the complementary strand is built in the 5' to 3' direction, which is the reverse complement.

So the complementary sequence, written 5' to 3', would be the original sequence's reverse complement.

Let me try to write each nucleotide in reverse order and then take the complement.

Original sequence: A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G

Reversed: G C T A T G C G T T G A C T G C A A A

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me process each nucleotide in reverse order and take the complement.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

Take the given sequence, 5' to 3': A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G.

Write the complement of each nucleotide in reverse order.

So:

Original (5'→3'): A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G

Complement of each (A→T, T→A, C→G, G→C):

T T T A G C T A A C G C G A T A G C

But wait, that's the complement without reversing. So that would be if the original was 3'→5' and you're writing the complement as 5'→3'. But wait, no.

Ah, wait, when the original is 5'→3', the complement is 3'→5', so to write the complement as 5'→3', you need to take the reverse of the complement.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to reverse the original sequence first and then take the complement.

Let me try that.

Original sequence:

5' A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G 3'

Reversed sequence (3'→5'): G C T A T G C G C T T G A T C G A A A

Now, take the complement of each nucleotide in this reversed sequence.

G → C

C → G

T → A

A → T

T → A

G → C

C → G

G → C

C → G

T → A

T → A

G → C

A → T

T → A

C → G

G → C

A → T

A → T

A → T

So putting it all together:

C G A T A C G C G A T A C G T T T

Wait, let me write each step carefully.

Reversed sequence: G C T A T G C G C T T G A T C G A A A

Taking each nucleotide and replacing with complement:

G → C
C → G
T → A
A → T
T → A
G → C
C → G
G → C
C → G
T → A
T → A
G → C
A → T
T → A
C → G
G → C
A → T
A → T
A → T

So the complemented reversed sequence is:

C G A T A C G C G A T A C G T T T

Wait, but wait, let me recheck. Because the reversed sequence is G C T A T G C G C T T G A T C G A A A.

So that's 18 nucleotides. Let me break it down:

1. G → C
2. C → G
3. T → A
4. A → T
5. T → A
6. G → C
7. C → G
8. G → C
9. C → G
10. T → A
11. T → A
12. G → C
13. A → T
14. T → A
15. C → G
16. G → C
17. A → T
18. A → T
19. A → T ? Wait, no. Wait, the reversed sequence is 18 nucleotides.

Wait, let's correct this. The original sequence is 18 nucleotides long. So when reversed, it's 18, so the complement will have 18.

Wait, the reversed sequence is 18 nucleotides: G C T A T G C G C T T G A T C G A A A ?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the reversed sequence.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to write the original sequence as a string, then reverse it, then take the complement.

The original is: AAATCGATTGCGCTATCG.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps I can process each part.

Wait, maybe the given sequence is written as 5' – AAAT C G A TTG C G C T A T C G –3'

So without the spaces, it's: AAATCGATTGCGCTATCG.

Wait, let me count the letters.

AAAT: 4
CGA:3 → 7
TTG:3 →10
CGC:3 →13
TAT:3 →16
CG:2 →18. Yep, 18 nucleotides.

So the original is 18 nt long.

The complementary strand will have 18 nt, in reverse order and complemented.

So for each nucleotide, starting from the end:

The original ends with G (position 18), so the complement starts with C (position 1 in the new strand, which is 5').

Wait, perhaps I should write the original as 5'→3': A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G.

So the complementary strand, written 3'→5', is C G A T A C G C G A T A C G T T T.

But since DNA strands are written 5'→3', the complementary strand as 5'→3' would be the reverse of that, which would be T T T A C G A T A G C G T A C A T C G.

Wait, no, that can't be right. I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach: the complementary strand is formed by pairing each nucleotide in the original, but in reverse order.

So the original is 5' →3' : A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G.

The complementary would be 3' →5' : T T T A G C T A A C G C G A T A G C.

But when written in 5' →3' direction, the complementary is C G A T A G C G C G A T T C G A A A T.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should write the complementary as 5' to 3' by taking the reverse complement of the original.

So the original is 5' A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G 3'

The reverse complement would be 5' C G A T A G C G C G A T T C G A A A T 3'.

Wait, let me write it out.

Original (5'→3'): A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G.

Reverse the sequence to get 3'→5': G C T A T G C G C T T G A T C G A A A.

Then, take the complement of this reversed sequence to get the 5'→3' direction.

Wait, no. The reversed sequence is the original read backward. To get the complementary strand, which is antiparallel, you take each nucleotide's complement in reverse order.

So the correct complementary strand (5'→3') is the complement of the original in reverse order.

So for the original: A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G.

Take the complement: T T T A G C T A A C G C G A T A G C.

Then reverse this complement to get the 5'→3' strand.

Wait, no. Wait, the complementary strand is built in the 5'→3' direction, and it's the reverse complement of the original.

So the correct way is to reverse the original sequence and then take the complement.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up.

Let me try an alternative approach.

The given strand is 5'→3': A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G.

The complementary strand must be 3'→5': T T T A G C T A A C G C G A T A G C.

But when written in the 5'→3' direction, the complementary strand is the reverse of that.

So the 5'→3' complementary strand would be C G A T A G C G C G A T T C G A A A T.

Wait, that can't be right because the length is same as original.

Wait, but the options are all written as 3' something 5'.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3' - TTTG A C G AAC G C G T A G C G -5'

Wait, let me look at the options:

Option A: 3' - TTTG A C G AAC G C G T A G C G -5'

Wait, perhaps I should compare each option.

Wait, perhaps I can find the correct complementary sequence and match it with the options.

The correct complementary sequence should be:

Each nucleotide in reverse order and complemented.

Original: 5' A A A T C G A T T G C G C T A T C G 3'

So the complementary will be 3' T T T A G C T A A C G C G A T A G C 5'

But wait, that's written 3'→5'. So when written as 5'→3', it would be C G A T A G C G C G A T T C G A A A T.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try to write each step.

Let me write the original sequence as a list:

Positions 1 to 18:

1: A

2: A

3: A

4: T

5: C

6: G

7: A

8: T

9: T

10: G

11: C

12: G

13: C

14: T

15: A

16: T

17: C

18: G

To get the complementary strand, each position's nucleotide is complemented and the order is reversed.
