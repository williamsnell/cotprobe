Okay, so I have this problem here about bakers making apple pies. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says that the bakers have 15 boxes of apples. Each box contains 18 apples. They use 7 apples for each pie. I need to find out how many pies they can make in total. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Alright, first, I should calculate the total number of apples they have. Since there are 15 boxes and each has 18 apples, I can multiply these two numbers together. Let me write that down: 15 boxes * 18 apples per box. Hmm, 15 times 18. Let me think about how to compute that. I remember that 15 times 18 is the same as 15*(20-2) which is 15*20 minus 15*2. 15*20 is 300, and 15*2 is 30, so 300-30 is 270. So there are 270 apples in total.

Now, each pie requires 7 apples. To find out how many pies they can make, I need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pie. So that's 270 divided by 7. Let me do that division. 

Hmm, 7 goes into 27 three times because 7*3 is 21, and that leaves a remainder of 6. Then bring down the 0, making it 60. 7 goes into 60 eight times because 7*8 is 56. Subtracting that from 60 gives a remainder of 4. So the division would give me 38 with a remainder of 4. Wait, but the question is asking for the total number of pies. So if they have 4 apples left over, they can't make a full pie with those. So they can only make 38 pies.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 38 pies times 7 apples per pie would be 38*7. Let me calculate that: 30*7 is 210 and 8*7 is 56, so 210+56 is 266. Oh wait, but they have 270 apples, so 266 apples used leaves 4 left. That makes sense. So 38 pies is correct, which would be option F.

But wait, looking at the options again: option F is 38. But wait, let me check if I multiplied correctly earlier. 15 boxes times 18 apples each. 15 times 18—let me compute it another way to confirm. 10 boxes would be 180 apples, and 5 boxes would be 90, so 180 +90 is 270. That's correct. So yes, 270 apples.

Dividing 270 by 7: 7*38 is 266, as I calculated. So the answer must be 38, which is option F.

Wait another thought—am I supposed to round up or down? Since you can't make a partial pie, you have to take the integer part. So yes, 38 is the correct number.

The total number of apples the bakers have is calculated by multiplying the number of boxes (15) by the number of apples per box (18), which equals 270 apples. Each pie requires 7 apples, so dividing 270 by 7 gives 38 pies with a remainder of 4 apples. Since only whole pies can be made, the total number of pies is 38.

Answer: F
