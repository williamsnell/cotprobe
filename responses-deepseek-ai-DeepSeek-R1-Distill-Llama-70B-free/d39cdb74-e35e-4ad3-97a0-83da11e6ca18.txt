Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Kubler-Ross and the stages of grief. I remember that Kubler-Ross proposed a model where people go through several stages when facing a terminal illness or significant loss. The question is about the initial reaction when a patient is told about their condition.

The options are from A to J. I think the stages are Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance. So the first stage is Denial. 

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that reflects denial. Let's go through each option.

Option A: “I hate everybody and everything!” That sounds more like anger, maybe stage two.

Option B: "Can we negotiate a deal, God?" That's bargaining, which is stage three.

Option C: “If you help me, God, I’ll reform my life!” Also bargaining, so same as B.

Option D: “No. it’s not possible!” This seems like denial because the person is refusing to accept the information.

Option E: “I give up: I'm powerless!” That might be depression, which is stage four.

Option F: "I don't believe in terminal illnesses." Hmm, that's more like avoidance or maybe not accepting reality, which could be denial as well.

Option G: "I'm not scared, I'm ready." That sounds like acceptance, the last stage.

Option H: "I knew this was coming." Not sure, maybe some form of acceptance or even denial if they're just acknowledging it without emotional response.

Option I: "I'll fight this and win." That's more like the fighting stage, maybe before denial or during bargaining.

Option J: "Why me? It's not fair!" That feels like anger or maybe the initial reaction of shock, but I think it's more about anger.

Wait, so the initial reaction is denial. So between D and F. Option D is a direct refusal, like "No, it's not possible." Option F is about not believing in terminal illnesses, which is a bit different. Which one is more about denial?

I think D is the classic denial response. Like when someone first hears bad news, they might say, "No, that can't be right." So the answer should be D.

The question asks about the initial reaction of a terminally ill patient upon being informed of their condition, according to Kubler-Ross's model. The first stage in her model is Denial. Among the options, the one that best reflects denial is D: “No. it’s not possible!” This response typifies the initial refusal to accept the reality of the situation.

Answer: D
