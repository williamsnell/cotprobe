Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me about why most people can tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi. Hmm, I need to figure out which psychological concept explains this. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about detecting the difference between two similar things, Coke and Pepsi. So it's about perception and how we distinguish between similar stimuli. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Depth perception. Wait, that's about how we perceive 3D objects, judging distances. Doesn't seem related to tasting soda differences. So probably not A.

Option B: Sensory adaptation. That's when our senses get less sensitive because of constant stimuli. Like if you're in a room with a certain smell and after a while, you don't notice it as much. But here, the question is about detecting a difference, not getting used to something. So maybe not B.

Option C: Subliminal perception. That's about processing stimuli below the threshold of conscious awareness, like hidden messages. I don't think that's what's happening when someone tastes and consciously detects a difference. So C is probably out.

Option D: Perceptual constancy. That's when our perception remains consistent even if the sensory input changes, like seeing a door as the same even when it's open or closed. Not sure how that applies to taste differences. Maybe not D.

Option E: Gestalt principles. Those are about how our brain organizes visual information into patterns and shapes. Doesn't seem related to taste. So E is unlikely.

Option F: Absolute threshold. That's the minimum amount of a stimulus that a person can detect. Like the faintest sound you can hear. But in this case, the question is about the difference between two stimuli, not the minimum detection. So F might not be the right choice.

Option G: Signal detection theory. This deals with how we detect signals amidst noise. It's about recognizing when a stimulus is present or not, considering both hits and false alarms. I'm not sure how directly this applies to distinguishing between two similar products. Maybe, but let me think more.

Option H: Divided attention. That's when you're paying attention to multiple things at once. But the question is about detecting a difference, not about how attention is split. So H might not be the answer.

Option I: Selective attention. This is when you focus on specific stimuli while ignoring others. Again, the question is about detecting a difference, not about what you're focusing on. So I might not be it.

Option J: Difference threshold. Oh wait, the difference threshold is the minimum difference between two stimuli that a person can detect. Like, how much louder a sound has to be for you to notice it's louder. So if people can tell Coke and Pepsi apart, it's because the difference exceeds their difference threshold. That makes sense. So J sounds right.

Let me double-check. The question is about why people can detect the difference. So it's about the just noticeable difference between two stimuli, which is exactly what difference threshold refers to. So the correct answer should be J.

The question asks why most people can detect the difference between Coke and Pepsi, which involves the concept of distinguishing between two similar stimuli. The correct answer relates to the minimum difference between two stimuli that a person can perceive. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A (Depth perception)**: Irrelevant, as it pertains to 3D vision.
- **B (Sensory adaptation)**: Refers to reduced sensitivity over time, not detecting differences.
- **C (Subliminal perception)**: Involves unconscious processing, not conscious detection.
- **D (Perceptual constancy)**: Deals with consistent perception despite changing stimuli, not relevant here.
- **E (Gestalt principles)**: Related to organizing visual information, not taste.
- **F (Absolute threshold)**: Concerns the minimum detectable stimulus, not differences between stimuli.
- **G (Signal detection theory)**: Focuses on detecting signals amidst noise, not directly about differences.
- **H (Divided attention)**: Involves attending to multiple stimuli, not detecting differences.
- **I (Selective attention)**: Focuses on specific stimuli, not differences.
- **J (Difference threshold)**: Refers to the minimum detectable difference between two stimuli, which explains why people can distinguish between Coke and Pepsi.

The correct answer is **J: Difference threshold**, as it directly addresses the ability to detect differences between similar stimuli.

Answer: J
