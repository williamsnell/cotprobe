Question:

An American franchise operates as an importer and distributor of bicycles manufactured by a foreign country, and maintains several warehouses for the wholesale distribution of the bicycles. A warehouse located in a county handles the distribution of bicycles for several states. The bikes and bike tires are shipped separately to the county warehouse. The tires are mingled, stacked, and stored in the warehouse along with various other tires. The bicycles, on the other hand, arrive completely assembled in their shipping crates and remain on the loading docks. The county imposes an ad valorem property tax on the bikes and tires. The county's ad valorem tax may properly be assessed against the

Options:

A: bikes and tires, but only when they are stored in the warehouse.
B: bicycles only.
C: tires, but only while they are in the warehouse.
D: tires and bicycles.
E: bikes and tires, but only during the distribution process.
F: bicycles, but only while they are on the loading docks.
G: bicycles, but only if they are not in their shipping crates.
H: neither the tires nor the bicycles, unless they are being actively distributed.
I: neither the tires nor the bicycles.
J: tires only.

Okay, so I've got this tax question here about ad valorem property taxes. I remember ad valorem means based on value, right? So it's a type of property tax where the tax is calculated as a percentage of the property's value.

The question is about an American franchise that imports and distributes bicycles from a foreign country. They have warehouses for wholesale distribution. One warehouse in a particular county serves several states. Now, the bikes and tires are shipped separately to this county warehouse. 

The tires are mingled, stacked, and stored along with other tires. The bicycles arrive completely assembled in shipping crates and stay on the loading docks. The county is imposing an ad valorem property tax on both the bikes and tires. The question is, can they do that?

Hmm. I think I need to figure out if the bikes and tires are considered taxable property in the county. I remember something about property taxes applying to tangible personal property. So, if the items are personal property and have a taxable situs, the tax can be imposed.

Wait, taxable situs refers to where the property is located for tax purposes. Generally, property is taxed where it's located on the assessment date, usually January 1st. So, if the bikes and tires are in the warehouse on that date, they might be taxable there.

But wait, are they considered to be part of the inventory? I think inventory is sometimes exempt or treated differently. Oh, but they're stored in a warehouse, so maybe they're part of the business's inventory, which could be taxable.

Another thing I'm trying to remember is about goods in transit. If the goods are just passing through and not stored for an extended period, they might not be taxable. But in this case, the bikes and tires are stored in the warehouse. The tires are mingled and stacked, so they're not just in transit anymore. The bicycles are on the loading docks, but they're there for distribution to several states, so maybe they're stored there for a while.

Wait, the fact that the bikes are in shipping crates on the loading dockâ€”does that matter? I think if they're still in their shipping crates and not yet moved into the warehouse, maybe they're considered goods in transit. Or does being on the loading dock count as being stored?

Alternatively, if the property is in the warehouse and part of the business's inventory, then it's taxable. So the tires are definitely in the warehouse, so they would be taxable. What about the bicycles? They're on the loading dock, which is part of the warehouse premises, I suppose.

I think that as long as the property has a taxable situs, which it does if it's located there, even temporarily, it's subject to tax. Unless there's an exemption. 

Wait, there's something about imports. Sometimes imports are exempt until they enter the stream of commerce. But once they're stored in a warehouse for distribution, they're part of the stream of commerce, so they lose that exemption. 

So the tires are in the warehouse, not in transit, so taxable. The bicycles, even if on the loading dock, are part of the inventory stored there, so they're taxable too. 

So the county can assess the tax on both the bikes and the tires, regardless of where exactly in the warehouse they are. So looking at the options, the correct answer would be D: tires and bicycles.

Wait, let me check the options again. Yes, option D says tires and bicycles. So the answer should be D.

The question revolves around whether an ad valorem property tax can be assessed on bicycles and tires stored in a warehouse. Ad valorem taxes are based on the value of property and typically apply to tangible personal property with a taxable situs, meaning the property must be located in the jurisdiction on the tax assessment date.

The key factors are:

1. **Tires**: The tires are mingled, stacked, and stored in the warehouse, indicating they are no longer in transit and are part of the inventory. Inventory stored in a warehouse is generally subject to property tax.

2. **Bicycles**: The bicycles arrive assembled in shipping crates and remain on the loading docks. Although they are in crates, they are stored on the warehouse premises for distribution. Since they are part of the inventory and not merely in transit, they also have a taxable situs.

Both the tires and bicycles are considered taxable property in the county where the warehouse is located. Therefore, the county can properly assess the ad valorem property tax on both items.

**Answer: D**
