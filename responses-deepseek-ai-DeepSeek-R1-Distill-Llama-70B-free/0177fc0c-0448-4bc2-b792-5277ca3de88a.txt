Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of entropy changes and all that. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about calculating the total change in entropy when a sample of nitrogen gas undergoes an isothermal irreversible expansion. Hmm, right, isothermal means the temperature stays constant, which I remember is important because for ideal gases, the internal energy doesn't change when temperature is constant. But wait, entropy change isn't zero in such cases, right?

So the given data is: mass of nitrogen is 14 grams. The initial conditions are 298 K and 1.00 bar. The process is an isothermal irreversible expansion where the gas doubles its volume, and the external pressure is zero. Oh wait, p_ex is zero? So the gas is expanding against a vacuum? That makes sense for an irreversible process.

Wait, wait, no. If p_ex is zero, that implies that the external pressure is zero, so the expansion is against a vacuum. So the work done would be zero because, in such cases, the system doesn't do work (since there's nothing pushing back). But wait, in an irreversible expansion, the work is calculated using the external pressure, right?

So for an isothermal process, the change in entropy of the system (the gas) can be calculated using the formula ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) because it's a reversible process entropy change, but wait, is that correct even for irreversible processes?

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. For entropy, the formula ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) applies when the process is reversible and isothermal. But for an irreversible process, do I have to consider the surroundings as well? Because the total entropy change is the sum of the system and the surroundings.

Wait, the problem says "total change in entropy," which I think refers to the universe, so both system and surroundings.

But since the process is isothermal and for an ideal gas, the heat transfer is Q = W, but wait, in this case, the work done is zero because p_ex is zero. So the gas isn't doing any work. Hmm, but wait, the expansion is happening, so the gas must be expanding into a vacuum. So the work done by the system is zero because there's no external pressure opposing it.

Wait, so in an isothermal expansion, the heat absorbed by the gas is equal to the work done. But since work done is zero, that would mean no heat is exchanged. So Q = 0. But for an ideal gas, the internal energy doesn't change with temperature, so ΔU = 0, and Q = W. If W is zero, then Q is zero.

But wait, if the process is isothermal, then the change in entropy of the gas is nR ln(V2/V1), regardless of whether the process is reversible or not, because entropy is a state function. So the system's entropy change is nR ln(2), since the volume doubles.

But what about the surroundings? Since the process is irreversible, the surroundings might have a change in entropy as well. Wait, but if the process is isothermal and Q is zero, then the surroundings don't exchange heat either, so their entropy change is zero. So the total entropy change is just that of the system, which is positive because the volume increases.

Wait, but let me think again. The formula for entropy change for the surroundings when heat is transferred is ΔS_surroundings = -Q_rev / T. But in this case, since Q is zero, the surroundings' entropy change is zero. So the total entropy change is just the system's entropy change, which is nR ln2.

Wait, but let's calculate it step by step. First, find the number of moles of nitrogen. The mass is 14 grams, and the molar mass of N2 is 28 g/mol. So moles n = 14g / 28g/mol = 0.5 mol.

Then, the entropy change of the system is ΔS_sys = nR ln(V2/V1) = 0.5 * R * ln(2). Since R is 8.314 J/mol·K, so 0.5 * 8.314 * ln(2) ≈ 0.5 * 8.314 * 0.693 ≈ let me calculate that.

0.5 * 8.314 is about 4.157. Multiply by 0.693: 4.157 * 0.693 ≈ around 2.88 J/K. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, the options have 3.6, 4.2, etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me re-calculate that:

n is 0.5 mol.

ΔS_sys = 0.5 * 8.314 * ln(2) = 0.5 * 8.314 * 0.693147.

Calculating 8.314 * 0.693147 first: 8 * 0.693 is about 5.544, 0.314*0.693 ≈ 0.217, so total ≈ 5.761. Multiply by 0.5 gives ≈2.8805 J/K. So approximately 2.88 J/K.

But looking at the options, the closest is I: 2.9 J/K. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: +6.3

B: +4.2

C: +0.75

D: +5.8

E: +3.6

F: +1.5

G: +8.4

H: +7.2

I: +2.9

J:+1.2

So option I is 2.9, which is close to my calculation of 2.88. So that would make me think that the answer is I.

Wait, but wait a minute. I thought that when the process is irreversible, the total entropy change is greater than zero, but in this case, the system's entropy increases, and the surroundings' entropy doesn't change because Q is zero. So the total entropy change is just the system's, which is +2.88, so option I.

But another thought: wait, is the process really isothermal? The problem states that it's an isothermal irreversible expansion. Since it's isothermal, the temperature is constant, so for the system (ideal gas), ΔU is zero, so Q = W. But since the expansion is against zero pressure, the work W is zero, so Q is zero. So no heat is exchanged, so the surroundings' entropy change is zero. So the total is just the system's, which is positive.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the process. Wait, in an irreversible expansion, sometimes the calculation involves using the initial and final states with the entropy change being the same as for a reversible process because entropy is a state function. So regardless of the path, the entropy change of the system is the same.

So the system's entropy change is indeed nR ln(V2/V1) = 0.5 * R * ln(2) ≈ 2.88 J/K. Therefore, the total change in entropy is +2.88 J/K, which is approximately option I: +2.9 J/K^{-1}.

But wait, another angle: sometimes, in irreversible processes, the entropy change is calculated as ΔS = Q_rev / T, but in this case, since the process is irreversible, perhaps the heat transfer is different?

Wait, no. The entropy change of the system depends only on the initial and final states, not the path. So whether the process is reversible or irreversible, the system's entropy change is the same. So it's nR ln(V2/V1).

So the total entropy change is just the system's, which is +2.88 J/K, so option I.

To calculate the total change in entropy for the isothermal irreversible expansion of nitrogen gas, we start by noting that entropy is a state function. This means the change in entropy depends only on the initial and final states of the system, not the path taken. For an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal process, the entropy change of the system is given by:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = nR \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)
\]

Here, the gas doubles its volume (\(V_2/V_1 = 2\)), and the number of moles of nitrogen is calculated from its mass. The molar mass of \(N_2\) is \(28 \, \mathrm{g/mol}\), so:

\[
n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{14 \, \mathrm{g}}{28 \, \mathrm{g/mol}} = 0.5 \, \mathrm{mol}
\]

Substituting into the formula for entropy change:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = 0.5 \cdot R \cdot \ln(2)
\]

Using \(R = 8.314 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K}\) and \(\ln(2) \approx 0.693\):

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = 0.5 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 0.693 \approx 2.88 \, \mathrm{J/K}
\]

Since the process is isothermal and the external pressure is zero (\(p_{\text{ex}} = 0\)), no work is done by the gas, and there is no heat exchange with the surroundings (\(Q = 0\)). As a result, the surroundings' entropy change is zero:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{surroundings}} = 0
\]

The total entropy change is therefore equal to the system's entropy change:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{total}} = \Delta S_{\text{system}} + \Delta S_{\text{surroundings}} = 2.88 \, \mathrm{J/K} + 0 = +2.88 \, \mathrm{J/K}
\]

This value is closest to option **I: +2.9 J/K**. Thus, the total change in entropy is approximately \(+2.9 \, \mathrm{J/K}\).
