Okay, so I've got this problem about filters and their optical properties. Hmm, it's a bit confusing, but let's try to break it down step by step. 

The problem has two parts, (a) and (b). Let's start with part (a).

In part (a), I'm given a filter #1 with a thickness of 2mm. Its transmittance is τ₁λ = 0.512, and the internal optical density δ₁λ is 0.2518. I need to compute the internal transmittance v₁λ of filter 1.

Wait, what's the difference between transmittance (τ) and internal transmittance (v)? I remember that transmittance includes both the internal transmittance and the effects of reflection at the surfaces. Oh right, when light enters and exits the filter, some of it reflects off the surfaces. So τ is the total transmittance considering those reflections, whereas v is just the fraction that passes through the material itself, without considering the surface reflections.

The formula I think connects τ and v is the one that accounts for multiple reflections. Oh wait, the formula is τ = (2v)/(1 + v²), but wait, no, I think that's when you have two surfaces. Or maybe it's τ = (2v)/(1 + v)²? Or perhaps τ = (v) / (1 + something). Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, I remember that the transmittance τ is related to the internal transmittance v by the equation τ = (v)/(1 + (n-1)/(n+1)^2 * (1 - v)) )? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, I think the correct formula is τ = v / (1 + ( (n-1)/(n+1) )^2 * (1 - v) ) ). Or perhaps it's simpler.

Wait, another approach: The total transmittance τ can be expressed in terms of the internal transmittance v, considering reflection at both surfaces. The formula I remember is τ = (2v)/(1 + v²). No, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Oh, I think I'm mixing up the formulas for reflectance and transmittance. For normal incidence, the reflectance R at each surface is ((n - 1)/(n + 1))^2, where n is the refractive index relative to the surrounding medium. Since the filter is in a medium with n=1.53, the surrounding is probably air with n=1, so R = ((1.53 - 1)/(1.53 + 1))^2 = (0.53/2.53)^2 ≈ (0.2092)^2 ≈ 0.0438 or about 4.38% reflection per surface.

Wait, but when calculating the total transmittance τ, we have to account for both the front and back surfaces. So the transmittance through each surface is T = 1 - R, which is about 0.9562 per surface. But that's just the surface transmission. The internal transmittance v is due to absorption and scattering within the material.

Wait, the internal transmittance v is the fraction of light that passes through the material without being absorbed. So the total transmittance τ would be T_surface * v * T_surface, but wait, no, because the light enters through the front surface (so T = 1-R), then goes through the material (v), and then exits through the back surface (another T = 1-R). So τ = (1-R)^2 * v.

But wait, that can't be the whole story because there's also the possibility of multiple internal reflections. Like, some light might reflect back and forth inside the filter before exiting. But I'm not sure if that's considered here. Oh, but perhaps for this problem, we're assuming that the filter's internal transmittance v is the effective transmittance considering the thickness and absorption, and the τ is the overall transmittance including the surface reflections.

Wait, the formula for τ when considering surface reflections is τ = (2v)/(1 + v²), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, the correct formula might be τ = (v) / (1 + ( (n-1)/(n+1) )^2 (1 - v) ) ), but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's simpler: τ = v * (1 - R)^2, where R is the reflectance per surface.

Wait, the problem states that the computations are carried out for normal incidence and with a constant relative refractive index n=1.53. So perhaps the correct approach is to relate τ and v via the formula that includes the surface reflections.

Wait, I think the formula is τ = (v) / (1 + ( ( (n-1)/(n+1) )^2 ) * (1 - v) ) ). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's τ = (2v)/(1 + v²). Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't do that right now. Let me think again.

I recall that the total transmittance τ of a material considering surface reflection is given by τ = ( (1 - R) * (1 - R) ) * v, where R is the reflectance. But that would be τ = (1 - R)^2 * v. But that seems too simplistic because it doesn't account for multiple internal reflections.

Wait, no, actually, the correct formula for the total transmittance τ when considering multiple internal reflections is τ = ( (1 - R) * v ) / (1 - R * v^2 ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's τ = (2v)/(1 + v^2), but that doesn't involve R. Hmm.

Wait, I think the correct formula is: τ = v * (1 - R) / (1 - R*v), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula:

τ = ( (1 - R) ) / ( e^{δ d} + R e^{-δ d} ) ) * (1 - R) e^{-δ d}

Wait, no, that seems more complicated. Alternatively, I think the relation between τ and v is given by the equation:

τ = ( (1 - R) )^2 * v / (1 - R v )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express R in terms of n and then relate τ and v.

Wait, R is the reflectance per surface, which is (n-1)^2/(n+1)^2. Since n is the relative refractive index, which is 1.53. So R = (0.53)^2/(2.53)^2 ≈ (0.2809)/(6.4009) ≈ 0.0439, so about 4.39% per surface.

But how does this tie into τ and v?

Wait, another approach. The internal transmittance v is the transmittance due to the material only, without considering the surface reflections. So the total transmittance τ would be the product of the surface transmission and the internal transmission, but including multiple internal reflections.

Wait, the formula for the total transmittance τ is:

τ = ( T^2 * v ) / (1 - R * v )

where T is the surface transmittance, which is sqrt( (4n) )/( (n+1)^2 ) ), but wait, for normal incidence, T = 1 - R.

Wait, no, for each surface, the transmittance is T = 1 - R. So for two surfaces, the surface transmittance would be T_total = T * T = (1 - R)^2. But that's without considering internal reflections.

Wait, but when a beam enters the material, some of it reflects back, and some goes through. The part that goes through then has some transmitted through the back surface, but the part that reflects can bounce back and forth, each time losing some intensity.

So the total transmittance τ can be expressed as τ = (T^2 * v) / (1 - R * v^2 ), but I'm not entirely sure. Because each time the light bounces, it's multiplied by R and v twice (once for each pass). So the first pass is T^2 * v. The second term is T^2 * v * R * v * R * v, which is T^2 * R^2 * v^3. Wait, that seems complicated.

Alternatively, I've read before that the total transmittance τ for a plane parallel plate is given by:

τ = ( (1 - R) * v ) / ( 1 - R * v^2 )

where R is the reflectance per surface.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's assume this is correct for now. So, τ = ( (1 - R) * v ) / (1 - R * v^2 )

Wait, but I'm given τ and I need to find v. Let's plug in the numbers.

First, compute R. Since n = 1.53, R = (n-1)^2/(n+1)^2 = (0.53)^2/(2.53)^2. Let me calculate that.

0.53^2 = 0.2809
2.53^2 ≈ 6.4009
So R ≈ 0.2809 / 6.4009 ≈ 0.0439.

So R ≈ 0.0439.

Now, the formula τ = ( (1 - R) * v ) / (1 - R * v^2 )

Wait, but that's a quadratic equation in terms of v. Hmm, solving for v would involve some algebra.

But wait, maybe I should think differently. Because the internal transmittance v is related to the internal optical density δ by the formula v = e^{-δ d}, where d is the thickness in mm. Wait, no, the internal optical density is usually defined as δ = (ln(1/v)) / d, so v = e^{- δ d}.

Wait, wait, the internal optical density is defined as the optical density per unit thickness. So the optical density D is δ * d, and since D = -ln(v), we have δ = D/d = (-ln(v))/d. So v = e^{- δ d}.

Wait, that makes sense. So for part (a), v₁λ = e^{- δ₁λ * d}, where d is 2 mm. Because the internal optical density δ is per mm, so for a 2 mm thickness, the total optical density is 2 * δ₁λ.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "internal optical density δ₁λ". So, δ is the optical density per unit thickness. So the total optical density D is δ * d. Therefore, the internal transmittance v is v = e^{-D} = e^{- δ d}.

So for part (a), v₁λ = e^{- δ₁λ * d} = e^{-0.2518 * 2}.

Wait, 0.2518 * 2 is 0.5036. So v₁λ = e^{-0.5036} ≈ ?

Let me compute that. e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, and e^-0.5036 is slightly less. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator:

0.5036 → e^-0.5036 ≈ 0.605.

Wait, let me double-check with a calculator. Alternatively, using a Taylor expansion or approximate method.

But perhaps I can use the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that τ is given, and relate it to v.

Wait, but wait. Because I'm given τ and δ, perhaps I should first compute v using the relation between τ and v, which involves the surface reflections.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to be systematic.

In part (a), given: τ₁λ = 0.512, δ₁λ = 0.2518, d = 2 mm.

We need to find v₁λ.

We can compute v from δ and d: v = e^{- δ * d}.

So δ₁λ is 0.2518 per mm. So for d = 2 mm, D = δ * d = 0.2518 * 2 = 0.5036.

Thus, v = e^{-0.5036} ≈ e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, but 0.5036 is slightly less than 0.5, so e^-0.5036 is about 0.605.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give τ in terms of this, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is τ = (v)/(1 + (n-1)^2/(n+1)^2 * (1 - v) )

Wait, that formula might be the correct one. Let me think.

I think the formula for the total transmittance τ considering surface reflections is given by:

τ = ( (1 - R) * v ) / ( 1 - R * v )

Wait, that can't be right because the formula I've seen before is more like:

τ = ( (1 - R) * v ) / (1 - R * v^2 )

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

τ = (2 v) / (1 + v² )

But that doesn't involve R, which doesn't make sense because R should affect τ.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the relation between τ and v using the formula that includes R.

The formula I think is correct is:

τ = ( (1 - R) * v ) / ( 1 - R * v )

Wait, let's try plugging in the numbers to see if that makes sense.

We have τ = 0.512, R ≈ 0.0439. So:

0.512 = ( (1 - 0.0439) * v ) / ( 1 - 0.0439 * v )

Let me compute 1 - R = 0.9561.

So:

0.512 = (0.9561 * v ) / (1 - 0.0439 v )

Multiply both sides by denominator:

0.512 (1 - 0.0439 v ) = 0.9561 v

Expand left side:

0.512 - 0.512 * 0.0439 v = 0.9561 v

Compute 0.512 * 0.0439 ≈ 0.0225.

So:

0.512 - 0.0225 v = 0.9561 v

Bring terms with v to one side:

0.512 = 0.9561 v + 0.0225 v

0.512 = (0.9561 + 0.0225) v → 0.512 = 0.9786 v

So v ≈ 0.512 / 0.9786 ≈ 0.523.

But wait, earlier I computed v using δ and d as v ≈ e^{-0.5036} ≈ 0.605. But that's a different value. So this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the definitions. Let me clarify:

The internal transmittance v is the transmittance through the material only, not considering surface reflections. So v is given by v = e^{- δ d}.

But the total transmittance τ is the product of the surface transmittances and the internal transmittance, considering multiple internal reflections.

Alternatively, perhaps τ is given by τ = (v) / (1 + (n-1)^2/(n+1)^2 (1 - v) )

Wait, I think I've read that before. Let me check that formula.

The formula for the total transmittance τ, considering surface reflections, is:

τ = v / (1 + ( (n - 1)/(n + 1) )^2 (1 - v) )

Wait, that sounds familiar. So let's compute that.

We have v = e^{-δ d} = e^{-0.2518 * 2} ≈ e^{-0.5036} ≈ 0.605.

But if we use the formula τ = v / (1 + R (1 - v) ), where R is (n-1)^2/(n+1)^2 ≈ 0.0439.

So τ = v / (1 + R (1 - v) )

Plugging in v ≈ 0.605 and R ≈ 0.0439:

Denominator = 1 + 0.0439*(1 - 0.605) = 1 + 0.0439*(0.395) ≈ 1 + 0.0173 ≈ 1.0173.

So τ ≈ 0.605 / 1.0173 ≈ 0.595.

But the problem states that τ₁λ is 0.512, which is lower than 0.595. So that suggests that our initial assumption about v being e^{-δ d} is incorrect, which can't be. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the other way around. Maybe the internal transmittance v is related to τ and R.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is τ = ( (1 - R) * v ) / (1 - R * v )

Wait, trying that:

(1 - R) = 0.9561.

So:

τ = (0.9561 * v) / (1 - 0.0439 v )

We have τ = 0.512.

So:

0.512 = (0.9561 v) / (1 - 0.0439 v )

Multiply both sides by denominator:

0.512 (1 - 0.0439 v ) = 0.9561 v

Expanding:

0.512 - 0.512 * 0.0439 v = 0.9561 v

Calculate 0.512 * 0.0439 ≈ 0.0225.

So:

0.512 - 0.0225 v = 0.9561 v

Bring terms together:

0.512 = 0.9561 v + 0.0225 v → 0.512 = 0.9786 v → v ≈ 0.512 / 0.9786 ≈ 0.523.

But according to the other approach, v should be e^{-δ d} = e^{-0.5036} ≈ 0.605. These two values of v are conflicting, which suggests I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the internal optical density δ is defined differently. Maybe δ is the optical density, which is D = δ * d = -ln(v). So v = e^{-δ d}.

So for part (a), δ₁λ = 0.2518, d = 2mm.

v₁λ = e^{-0.2518 * 2} = e^{-0.5036} ≈ 0.605.

But
