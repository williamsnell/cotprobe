Okay, so I have this economics question about demand curves and shifts. Hmm, I remember that demand curves show the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded. When something happens that increases the quantity demanded at every price, the demand curve shifts to the right. Conversely, if something decreases the quantity demanded, it shifts to the left.

The question asks what would cause the demand for orange juice to shift to the right. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: A decrease in the price of orange juice. Wait, if the price of OJ goes down, people might buy more, but that's a movement along the demand curve, not a shift. Because the change is in price, which is on the axis, so it's just a movement, not a shift. So A isn't the right answer.

Option B: A decrease in the price of Tang. Tang is a substitute for orange juice, right? If Tang becomes cheaper, people might buy more Tang and less OJ. That would decrease the demand for OJ, shifting the curve to the left. So B isn't the right answer either.

Option C: An increase in the price of grapefruit juice. Grapefruit juice is another substitute. If it becomes more expensive, people might switch to OJ because it's relatively cheaper now. So demand for OJ would increase, shifting the curve to the right. C looks promising.

Option D: A decrease in income for juice drinkers. Assuming OJ is a normal good, lower income would decrease demand, shifting the curve left. So D is out.

Option E: Bumper crop of oranges in Florida. More oranges would probably increase supply, leading to lower prices, but that affects supply, not demand. So E is about supply, not demand shift.

Option F: Expectations of higher future income. If people think they'll earn more later, they might buy more now, increasing current demand. That would shift the demand curve right. So F is another possibility.

Option G: Decrease in popularity of healthy drinks. OJ is often seen as healthy, so if healthy drinks are less popular, demand for OJ would drop. So G would shift left.

Option H: Significant increase in OJ price. That's a change in price, so movement along the curve, not a shift.

Option I: Decrease in price of apples. Apples are a different product. Unless they're substitutes, which I don't think they are. Maybe complements? Like, if apples are cheaper, maybe more people eat them with peanut butter, but how does that affect OJ? Not sure. Maybe negligible effect, so probably not the best option.

Option J: Expectations of lower future prices. If people expect OJ to be cheaper later, they might buy less now and wait, decreasing current demand. So J would cause a left shift.

So, from the options, C and F are the ones that cause a right shift.

Wait, let me think again. The question asks which is most likely to cause a right shift. So, between C and F.

Option C is about the price of a substitute increasing. If grapefruit juice becomes more expensive, people buy more OJ. So demand for OJ increases, curve shifts right.

Option F is about future income expectations. If people expect higher income, they might increase their current consumption, thinking they can afford more. So that's a positive shift.

So both C and F can cause a right shift. But let me check the options again to make sure.

Looking back:

Option C: An increase in the price of grapefruit juice. That's a substitute, so higher price makes OJ more attractive. So yes, demand for OJ increases.

Option F: Expectations of higher future income. If people think next year they'll have more money, they might buy more OJ now, because they expect to be wealthier. So that would increase current demand.

So which of these is more likely? Both are possible, but the question is which option is correct.

Wait, the question is about what causes a shift to the right, which is an increase in demand. So both could do that.

But looking at the options given, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, another thought—option B is a decrease in the price of Tang, which is a substitute. So if Tang is cheaper, people might buy more Tang and less OJ. So that would decrease OJ demand, shifting left. So B is the opposite.

Option F: If income is expected to rise, then current demand can increase because people are more optimistic about their future finances. So they might buy more now.

So both C and F would cause a right shift.

Wait, but looking again at the options, maybe the answer is F. Because if people expect higher income, their demand increases now.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the determinants of demand. The main factors are:

1. Price of the good (but changes cause movement along the curve)
2. Income
3. Prices of related goods (substitutes and complements)
4. Tastes/preferences
5. Expectations

So, in this case, option C is about a substitute's price increasing, which would increase demand for OJ. Option F is about expectations of higher income, which would increase demand.

So both C and F would shift the demand curve to the right.

But the question is asking which is the most likely. So perhaps I should look for the best option.

Wait, the options are:

C: An increase in the price of grapefruit juice (a substitute). So, yes, this would shift OJ demand right.

F: Expectations of higher income would also shift right.

So I need to see which of these is among the options.

Looking at the options, both C and F are present. So perhaps the answer is either C or F.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the wording. The question is about which option would most likely cause a right shift.

Which of these has a more direct impact? The price of a substitute increasing would directly make OJ more attractive, leading to higher demand. Similarly, expectations of higher income would lead to higher demand.

In an exam setting, which one is more likely to be the correct answer?

Hmm. Let me consider the options again.

Wait, in the options, option B says a decrease in the price of Tang, which is a substitute, which would cause a left shift. So the opposite.

Option C is an increase in the price of grapefruit juice, a substitute. So that's a right shift.

Option F is about expectations, which can cause a right shift.

So both C and F are possible, but I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, the question is about which is most likely. I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that in multiple-choice questions like this, the correct answer is usually the one that directly affects demand factors, such as prices of substitutes or complements, or income changes.

So, perhaps option C is a better answer. Because when a substitute becomes more expensive, people switch to the original product, thus increasing demand.

Alternatively, option F is an expectation of higher income, which would also increase demand.

I'm a bit torn between C and F.

Wait, perhaps I should look for other options that might also affect it, but I think C and F are the only ones that would cause a right shift.

So, perhaps the correct answer is either C or F.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

The question is which leads to a right shift, so an increase in demand.

So, considering all options:

Options that increase demand:

- C: Substitutes become more expensive → buy more OJ → demand increases.

- F: Expect higher income → buy more OJ now → demand increases.

Which one is the correct answer? The question is asking which is most likely. So perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, but sometimes, in exams, the correct answer is the one that's about substitutes. Because changes in substitute prices are a primary determinant.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F. Because if people expect higher income, they might buy more now.

Wait, maybe both C and F are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps only one is present.

Wait, the options are A through J, and each is a separate option. So the correct answer is either C or F, but which one is more likely?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.

Wait, another approach: the demand for a product increases (shifts right) when:

- Income increases (normal good)
- Price of substitutes increases
- Price of complements decreases
- Taste/preferences increase
- Expectations of higher future prices (people buy now before price goes up)
- Expectations of higher future income (they can afford to buy more now)

Wait, no. Expectations of higher future income would make people increase current consumption if they believe their income will rise. So yes, that would increase current demand.

So, both C and F would cause a right shift.

But looking at the options, perhaps the answer is F.

Wait, perhaps I should consider which factors are more significant. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the options given.

Looking back, the options are:

C: An increase in the price of grapefruit juice.

F: Expectations of higher future income among juice drinkers.

So, both would cause a right shift.

But I can only choose one. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F. Because expectations can have a strong impact on current purchasing decisions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because it's a direct competitor in the juice market.

I'm a bit stuck. But perhaps I should think about the fact that a change in substitute's price is a more direct cause.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F. Because if income is expected to rise, people might buy more now.

Wait, but expectations about future income would affect their current purchasing power, but it's more of an anticipatory effect. For example, if I expect to earn more next year, I might start buying more expensive things now, perhaps taking on debt or using savings.

But it's possible that the expectation leads to higher current demand.

In that case, both C and F would increase demand.

But perhaps in the context of this question, the answer is F.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake. Let me think again.

The question is about a shift to the right in the demand curve for orange juice. So, what causes an increase in demand.

Another approach: let's eliminate wrong options.

Options that cause a left shift or movement along the curve:

A: Price decrease → movement along curve, not shift.

B: Price of Tang decreases → substitute becomes cheaper → OJ demand decreases (left shift).

D: Income decreases → demand decreases (left).

E: Bumper crop → supply increases, not demand.

G: Less popularity for healthy drinks → OJ is healthy → demand decreases (left).

H: Price increase → movement along curve.

I: Price of apples decreases → not related unless apples are a complement. Unlikely.

J: Expect lower prices → buy less now, wait for lower prices → demand decreases (left).

So the only options left are C, F.

So, the correct answer is either C or F.

Now, which one is more likely to be correct.

In an exam, I think both could be correct, but perhaps the answer is F.

Wait, no, the question is about the demand curve shifting, not the supply. So, the correct answer is either C or F.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F, because expectations of higher income would increase demand, but I'm not fully confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C, because it's a direct substitute effect.

I think I'll have to go with C, as the increase in a substitute's price would definitely cause a right shift in OJ demand.

So, the answer is C.

To determine which option is most likely to result in a shift to the right in the demand curve for orange juice, we analyze each option based on the determinants of demand:

1. **Option A**: A decrease in the price of orange juice would cause a movement along the demand curve, not a shift, as it involves a change in the price of the good itself.

2. **Option B**: A decrease in the price of Tang, a substitute for orange juice, would make Tang more attractive, decreasing the demand for orange juice and shifting the demand curve to the left.

3. **Option C**: An increase in the price of grapefruit juice, a substitute for orange juice, would make grapefruit juice less attractive, increasing the demand for orange juice and shifting the demand curve to the right.

4. **Option D**: A decrease in income for juice drinkers would decrease the demand for orange juice, shifting the demand curve to the left, assuming orange juice is a normal good.

5. **Option E**: A bumper crop of oranges in Florida would increase the supply of orange juice, not the demand, as it affects supply rather than demand.

6. **Option F**: Expectations of higher future income among juice drinkers would increase current demand for orange juice, as people may choose to buy more now in anticipation of higher future income, shifting the demand curve to the right.

7. **Option G**: A decrease in the popularity of healthy drinks would decrease the demand for orange juice, shifting the demand curve to the left, as orange juice is often perceived as a healthy drink.

8. **Option H**: A significant increase in the price of orange juice would cause a movement along the demand curve, not a shift, as it involves a change in the price of the good itself.

9. **Option I**: A decrease in the price of apples is unlikely to have a significant impact on the demand for orange juice, as apples are not a close substitute or complement for orange juice.

10. **Option J**: Expectations of lower future prices for orange juice would decrease current demand, as people might choose to wait for lower prices, shifting the demand curve to the left.

From this analysis, both **Option C** (an increase in the price of grapefruit juice) and **Option F** (expectations of higher future income) would cause a right shift in the demand curve for orange juice. However, the question asks for the **most likely** cause. The increase in the price of a substitute (grapefruit juice) directly impacts the relative attractiveness of orange juice, making it the more direct and likely cause of a right shift in demand.

**Answer: C**
