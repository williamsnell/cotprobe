Question:

A 67-year-old man with Parkinson disease is admitted to the hospital for treatment of pneumonia. The patient's daughter, who is visiting the patient, says he has had increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation during the past 6 months. She also says that there are times during the day when his tremors increase in severity, although he continues to care for himself at home. Medical history is also remarkable for hypertension. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 78 kg (172 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 38.9°C (102.0°F), pulse 60/min supine and 68/min standing, respirations 22/min, and blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg supine and 80/50 mm Hg standing. The patient appears ill and older than his stated age. He is fully oriented but lethargic. Auscultation of the chest discloses rhonchi in the right mid lung field. Abdominal examination discloses no abnormalities. Neurologic examination discloses masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity; gait was not assessed on admission. Chest x-ray shows a right lower lobe infiltrate. ECG shows no abnormalities. Appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy is initiated. Prior to discharge, which of the following is the most appropriate step?

Options:

A: Begin corticosteroid treatment
B: Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube
C: Administer influenza vaccine
D: Prescribe fludrocortisone
E: Discontinue levodopa and carbidopa
F: Arrange for home oxygen therapy
G: Initiate physical therapy
H: Obtain CT scan of the chest
I: Obtain a swallowing evaluation
J: Start patient on anticoagulant therapy

Okay, so I've got this question here about a 67-year-old man with Parkinson's disease. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the patient is admitted with pneumonia. He's been having increased lethargy for the past day and decreased ambulation over six months. His daughter mentioned that his tremors get worse at times, but he's still able to take care of himself at home. His medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. He's a bit on the heavier side with a BMI of 28, so maybe a bit overweight.

Looking at his vital signs, he has a fever of 38.9°C, which is pretty high. His pulse is 60 when supine and 68 standing, which shows a slight increase but not a huge jump. Blood pressure is 100/60 supine and 80/50 standing. Oh, that's a significant drop. That's orthostatic hypotension, right? So when he stands up, his BP drops, which can cause dizziness or fainting.

On physical exam, he looks ill and older than his age. He's fully oriented but lethargic. His chest has rhonchi in the right mid lung field, which makes sense with the pneumonia. The chest x-ray confirms a right lower lobe infiltrate, so that's the pneumonia. The ECG is normal, so probably no cardiac issues here.

His neurological exam shows masked facies, bradykinesia, and cogwheel rigidity—all classic signs of Parkinson's. Gait wasn't assessed because he's probably not ambulating much now.

He's started on IV antibiotics, which is appropriate for pneumonia. The question is about what to do prior to discharge. So we're looking for the most appropriate step before sending him home.

Let's look at the options:

A: Begin corticosteroid treatment. I don't think so. He's being treated with antibiotics, so steroids might not be necessary unless it's a severe infection or there's an inflammatory component, but there's no indication here.

B: Place a PEG tube. He's able to care for himself at home, so unless he has severe dysphagia or can't eat, this isn't needed. Plus, the question doesn't mention issues with eating or swallowing.

C: Administer influenza vaccine. Wait, he's being treated for pneumonia, which is bacterial. The flu vaccine is for influenza, a virus. But maybe it's a preventive measure. However, it's not clear if it's flu season or if he's due for it. Also, the question is about prior to discharge, so maybe it's appropriate to vaccinate to prevent future issues, especially since he has a chronic condition.

D: Prescribe fludrocortisone. That's used for orthostatic hypotension. He does have a significant drop in BP when standing. Fludrocortisone can help increase blood volume and reduce orthostasis. That's a possibility.

E: Discontinue levodopa and carbidopa. No, those are essential for managing his Parkinson's symptoms. Stopping them could worsen his condition, so that's not appropriate.

F: Arrange for home oxygen therapy. His oxygen saturation isn't mentioned, but he has pneumonia. Maybe he needs oxygen, but the question doesn't specify low O2 levels. Also, after treatment, he might not require it anymore.

G: Initiate physical therapy. He's had decreased ambulation, and with Parkinson's, physical therapy could help maintain mobility and prevent complications like pressure sores or further decline. That sounds useful, especially since he's been less ambulatory.

H: Obtain CT scan of the chest. He already has a chest x-ray showing the infiltrate. A CT might be more detailed, but unless there's a complication or the pneumonia isn't resolving, it's probably unnecessary.

I: Obtain a swallowing evaluation. If there were concerns about dysphagia, especially with Parkinson's, which can affect swallowing, this might be important. But the daughter said he's able to care for himself, implying he can eat. Unless his lethargy is affecting that now, but the question doesn't specify.

J: Start anticoagulant therapy. There's no mention of blood clots or risk factors like DVT, so this doesn't seem relevant.

Now, considering his orthostatic hypotension. He's on hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, which can contribute to low blood pressure. Maybe adjusting medications could help, but the option isn't about that. Option D is about adding fludrocortisone, which is a mineralocorticoid that helps with blood pressure.

But another angle is his decreased ambulation. Immobility can lead to complications like pressure ulcers, muscle atrophy, and decreased mobility. So initiating physical therapy (option G) could help him regain strength and mobility, which is especially important for someone with Parkinson's who might already have motor issues.

Wait, but the patient has had decreased ambulation for six months. Could that be due to his Parkinson's progressing, or maybe deconditioning? Either way, physical therapy could help improve his mobility and prevent further decline.

Alternatively, the orthostatic hypotension could be a big issue. So which is more critical? The question is about the most appropriate step prior to discharge. Let me think.

Orthostatic hypotension can lead to falls, which is a big risk in the elderly, especially with Parkinson's. So managing that is crucial. Fludrocortisone could help with that. But other options to manage orthostasis include increasing salt intake, ensuring adequate hydration, and maybe adjusting medications that cause hypotension, like diuretics or beta-blockers.

Looking at his medications: he's on atenolol, a beta-blocker, which can cause bradycardia and potentially contribute to hypotension. The hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic, which can cause dehydration and orthostasis. So perhaps discontinuing or adjusting these medications could help, but that's not one of the options. The option D is adding fludrocortisone, which can help increase blood volume.

Alternatively, the question is about prior to discharge. Maybe the patient's current state, with orthostatic hypotension, puts him at risk when he goes home. So starting fludrocortisone could be necessary to manage that.

But another consideration is his mobility. If he's not ambulating well, he's at higher risk for complications like pneumonia again, or pressure sores. So physical therapy could address that.

Wait, the question says he's about to be discharged. So the appropriate step would be something to ensure his safety at home. If he's at risk for falls due to orthostasis, then treating that would be crucial. Alternatively, if he's not moving much, physical therapy could help prevent further decline.

Which option is more appropriate? Let me think about the management of orthostatic hypotension in Parkinson's patients. Parkinson's itself can cause autonomic dysfunction, leading to orthostasis. So managing that is important.

Fludrocortisone is sometimes used to manage orthostatic hypotension. It works by promoting sodium retention, increasing blood volume. So that could help.

But then, the patient is already on a diuretic, which would counteract that. So maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, maybe discontinuing the diuretic would be better, but that's about managing hypertension. The patient has hypertension, so they can't just stop the diuretic without alternative BP management.

Alternatively, the treatment for orthostatic hypotension includes non-pharmacological measures like increasing salt intake, drinking more fluids, wearing compression stockings, and avoiding sudden position changes. Maybe those are part of the management, but the options don't include those.

So among the options, D is about starting fludrocortisone. But if the diuretic is contributing, maybe adjusting that. However, the question doesn't present that as an option.

Alternatively, the patient's lethargy could be due to the infection, and once the pneumonia is treated, his energy levels might improve, making G (physical therapy) more appropriate to help him get moving again.

Wait, the primary issue upon discharge is likely to be his mobility and preventing further complications. So physical therapy to help him ambulate better would make sense. Plus, he's had decreased ambulation for six months, which could be contributing to his overall decline.

Another point: the patient's BMI is 28, which is overweight. Maybe that's contributing to his decreased mobility, but I don't think that's directly relevant here.

So, considering all, the most appropriate step would be to either manage his orthostasis or improve his mobility.

I think the best answer here is G: Initiate physical therapy. Because after being hospitalized, especially with pneumonia and decreased mobility, physical therapy can help him regain strength, improve mobility, and reduce the risk of further complications like pressure sores or deconditioning.

Alternatively, if the orthostatic hypotension is severe, that's a more immediate concern. But without knowing other factors, I think physical therapy is a standard part of recovery, especially in someone with limited mobility and Parkinson's.

The patient is a 67-year-old man with Parkinson’s disease admitted for pneumonia. He has increased lethargy, decreased ambulation over six months, and orthostatic hypotension (blood pressure drops from 100/60 supine to 80/50 standing). His medications include hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, levodopa, and carbidopa. The chest x-ray confirms a right lower lobe infiltrate, and he is started on appropriate intravenous antibiotics. The question asks for the most appropriate step prior to discharge.

**Analysis of options:**

- **A: Begin corticosteroid treatment**  
  Corticosteroids are not indicated here, as the patient is being treated for bacterial pneumonia with antibiotics, and there is no mention of a severe inflammatory component.

- **B: Place a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube**  
  There is no evidence of severe dysphagia or inability to eat, as the patient is able to care for himself at home. This is unnecessary.

- **C: Administer influenza vaccine**  
  While influenza vaccination is important for someone with a chronic condition like Parkinson’s, it is not directly relevant to the acute management of pneumonia or the discharge plan.

- **D: Prescribe fludrocortisone**  
  Fludrocortisone is used to manage orthostatic hypotension by increasing blood volume. The patient has significant orthostatic hypotension, but he is also on hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, which may counteract the effects of fludrocortisone. Adjusting current medications or non-pharmacological measures might be more appropriate.

- **E: Discontinue levodopa and carbidopa**  
  These medications are essential for managing Parkinson’s symptoms. Discontinuing them would worsen his condition and is not appropriate.

- **F: Arrange for home oxygen therapy**  
  There is no mention of hypoxia or need for supplemental oxygen, so this is unnecessary.

- **G: Initiate physical therapy**  
  The patient has decreased ambulation for six months, likely exacerbated by Parkinson’s and hospitalization. Physical therapy can help improve mobility, prevent further decline, and reduce complications like pressure sores or deconditioning. This is a standard and beneficial intervention for someone with limited mobility.

- **H: Obtain CT scan of the chest**  
  A CT scan is unnecessary, as the chest x-ray already confirms the pneumonia, and there is no indication of complications.

- **I: Obtain a swallowing evaluation**  
  There is no evidence of dysphagia, as the patient is able to care for himself at home. This is not indicated.

- **J: Start patient on anticoagulant therapy**  
  There is no mention of thromboembolic events or risk factors for blood clots, so this is not relevant.

**Conclusion:**  
The most appropriate step prior to discharge is to **initiate physical therapy**. This will address the patient’s decreased ambulation, help prevent further decline, and improve his mobility and overall recovery, especially given his Parkinson’s disease and recent hospitalization.
