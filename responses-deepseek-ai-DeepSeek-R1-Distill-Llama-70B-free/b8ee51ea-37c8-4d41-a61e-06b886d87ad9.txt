Okay, so I have this problem about E. coli cells and their ribosomes. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says there are 25,000 ribosomes in an E. coli cell. Each ribosome has structural proteins, and if we were to stretch all those proteins out as fully extended polypeptide chains, how many times could they encircle the E. coli cell. Hmm, I need to find the total length of all the proteins and compare it to the circumference of the E. coli cell.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Number of ribosomes = 25,000
- Diameter of each ribosome = 180 Å (angstroms). Wait, do I need the volume of a ribosome for this? Oh, right, because the problem mentions that the ribosomes contain 40% protein. So I guess I need to find the volume of one ribosome, then find out how much of that is protein, and from there find the total mass or volume of protein, and then convert that into the length of the polypeptide chains.

Wait, the specific gravity is 1.0, which means the density is the same as water, so 1g/cm³. But since we're dealing with proteins, maybe I should think in terms of protein density? Or perhaps it's just about the volume.

Wait, the problem says the ribosomes have a specific gravity of 1.0, so their density is 1 g/cm³. So each ribosome's volume is (4/3)πr³. The diameter is 180 Å, so the radius is 90 Å. Let me convert that into cm because density is in g/cm³.

Wait, 1 Å is 1e-8 cm. So 90 Å is 90e-8 cm, which is 9e-7 cm. So the volume of one ribosome is (4/3) * π * (9e-7 cm)^3.

Calculating that:

(4/3) * π ≈ 4.1888.

(9e-7)^3 = 729e-21 = 7.29e-19 cm³.

Multiply by 4.1888: 4.1888 *7.29e-19 ≈ 3.058e-18 cm³ per ribosome.

But wait, each ribosome is 40% protein by volume? Or by mass? The question says they contain 40% protein. I think it's by mass or volume. Hmm, the specific gravity is 1, so the mass density is same as water. So perhaps the proteins contribute 40% of the mass of the ribosome.

Wait, but proteins are denser than water. Hmm, but the ribosome's overall density is 1.0. So maybe the 40% is by mass. So for each ribosome, 40% of its mass is protein.

So the mass of a ribosome would be volume * density. Volume is 3.058e-18 cm³, density is 1 g/cm³, so mass is 3.058e-18 grams per ribosome.

Then 40% of that is protein: 0.4 * 3.058e-18 = 1.223e-18 grams per ribosome.

Now, for 25,000 ribosomes, total protein mass is 25,000 * 1.223e-18 g = 3.0575e-14 g.

Wait, 25,000 is 2.5e4, so 2.5e4 * 1.223e-18 = 3.0575e-14 grams.

Now, I need to find the total length of all the polypeptide chains from this mass. For that, I need to know the mass of a single protein chain, or perhaps the mass per unit length.

Wait, but proteins are made of amino acids. The molecular weight of an average amino acid is about 120 g/mol (since some are larger, some smaller; but roughly around that). So, the number of amino acids in a protein chain would determine the length, but since we're stretching them out, we need to know the linear length per residue.

Wait, but if I'm considering the polypeptide chains as fully extended, each amino acid contributes a certain length. For example, in an alpha helix, the rise per residue is about 1.5 Å, but when fully extended (like in a beta strand), it's about 3.5 Å per residue. Wait, but maybe for a fully extended chain, it's more like each amino acid adds about 3.5 Å to the length, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the chain is completely stretched, perhaps each peptide bond contributes a certain length.

Wait, the peptide bond is rigid, and in a fully extended conformation, each residue adds about 3.5 Å to the length. So each amino acid contributes about 3.5 Å. So the length per mole would be based on the number of amino acids.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the mass of a single amino acid, calculate how many are in the total protein, multiply by 3.5 Å per amino acid to get the total length.

So, let's proceed.

The total mass of all proteins is 3.0575e-14 grams.

The molecular weight of an average amino acid is about 120 g/mol. So, number of moles of amino acids = total mass / molecular weight.

Molar mass is 120 g/mol. So moles = 3.0575e-14 g / 120 g/mol = approx 2.5479e-16 mol.

Number of amino acids is moles multiplied by Avogadro's number (6.022e23 /mol).

So 2.5479e-16 mol * 6.022e23 = approx 1.534e8 amino acids.

Each contributes 3.5 Å to the length, so total length is 1.534e8 * 3.5 Å = 5.369e8 Å.

Wait, 1.534e8 *3.5 is 5.369e8. So 5.369e8 angstroms.

Now, convert that to meters because the E. coli cell's diameter is given in micrometers. 

1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 5.369e8 Å = 5.369e8 * 1e-10 m = 5.369e-2 meters, which is 5.369 centimeters.

Wait, that seems short, but let's check:

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the total mass of proteins is 3.0575e-14 g. Each amino acid is 120 g/mol, so moles = 3.0575e-14 / 120 = approx 2.548e-16 mol. Multiply by Avogadro's number: 2.548e-16 *6.022e23 = approx 1.534e8 amino acids.

Each amino acid contributes 3.5 Å: 1.534e8 *3.5 = 5.369e8 Å. 5.369e8 Å is 5.369e8 * 1e-10 m = 5.369e-2 m, which is 5.369 cm.

Wait, that's about 5.37 centimeters of total length.

Now, the E. coli cell is a sphere with 1 micron diameter. So the circumference is π * diameter = 3.1416 * 1e-6 meters = 3.1416e-6 m, which is 3.1416 micrometers.

So, how many times can 5.369 cm encircle a 3.1416e-6 m circumference?

First, convert 5.369 cm to meters: 0.05369 meters.

Number of encirclements = total length / circumference.

So 0.05369 m / 3.1416e-6 m = approx 17,100. But wait, none of the options are that high. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait the options are up to 4e4, like 40,000 times. So maybe my calculation is missing something.

Let me go back and check each step.

Wait, 25,000 ribosomes. Each has a volume of (4/3)π*(90e-8 cm)^3. Let's compute that again.

Wait, 90e-8 cm is 9e-7 cm.

Volume = (4/3) * π * (9e-7)^3.

Compute (9e-7)^3 = 729e-21 = 7.29e-19 cm³.

Multiply by 4/3 * π: 4.1888 * 7.29e-19 = approximately 3.058e-18 cm³ per ribosome.

Yes, that seems right.

Mass is volume * density: 3.058e-18 cm³ * 1 g/cm³ = 3.058e-18 g per ribosome.

40% is protein: 1.223e-18 g per ribosome.

Total for 25,000: 25,000 is 2.5e4. 2.5e4 * 1.223e-18 = 3.0575e-14 g. Correct.

Molar mass of amino acid = 120 g/mol.

Moles = 3.0575e-14 / 120 = approx 2.5479e-16 mol.

Number of amino acids: 2.5479e-16 *6.022e23 = approx 1.534e8.

Yes, correct.

Each amino acid contributes 3.5 Å: 1.534e8 *3.5 = 5.369e8 Å.

Convert to meters: 5.369e8 Å = 5.369e8 * 1e-10 m = 5.369e-2 m, which is 0.05369 m or 5.369 cm.

E. coli circumference is π * 1e-6 m = ~3.1416e-6 m.

So number of times around = 0.05369 / 3.1416e-6 = approximately 17,100. But looking at the options, the highest is 4e4, and the options are A to J, with E being 1.76e4, J 2e4, etc.

Wait, 17,100 is about 1.7e4, which is close to option E (1.76e4) or option J (2e4). Hmm, but why is my calculation getting 1.7e4 and the options have 1.76e4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion of Å to meters. Let me recheck that.

Wait, 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. So 5.369e8 Å is 5.369e8 * 1e-10 = 5.369e-2 meters. Yes, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the protein content. The problem says ribosomes contain 40% protein. Did I correctly calculate the protein mass?

Yes, 40% of 3.058e-18 g is 1.223e-18 g per ribosome.

Wait, maybe the specific gravity is given as 1.0, so the density is 1 g/cm³. So that part is correct.

Another possibility: Maybe the ribosomes are not spherical? No, the problem states the diameter is 180 Å, implying a sphere.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the per amino acid length. I assumed 3.5 Å per amino acid for a fully extended chain, but maybe the actual value is different.

Wait, some sources say that a fully extended polypeptide chain (like in a beta strand) has each residue contributing about 3.5 Å to the length. So that seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the length per mole of protein. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the average molecular weight per Å.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the number of amino acids per ribosome, then sum all of them.

Wait, another approach: Find the volume of all the proteins, then calculate how much length that would occupy if stretched out, assuming a certain cross-sectional area.

Wait, proteins are about 1.3 to 1.4 g/cm³ in density. But the cell's density is 1.0. Hmm, but earlier I considered the ribosome's density as 1.0, so perhaps the protein's density is different.

Wait, maybe I should have used the density of protein to find the volume from the mass of the proteins.

Wait, because I calculated the protein mass as 3.0575e-14 grams. If the density of protein is, say, 1.3 g/cm³, then the volume would be mass / density = 3.0575e-14 / 1.3 ≈ 2.352e-14 cm³.

But wait, maybe this isn't necessary because when the proteins are stretched out, the volume they occupy would be length * cross-sectional area.

Wait, when you stretch a protein into a long chain, the volume remains the same, assuming no overlap. So the volume of the protein is the same whether it's in a globule or stretched.

So the volume of all proteins is 3.0575e-14 g / (1 g/cm³) = 3.0575e-14 cm³ (since density is 1 g/cm³ for the ribosomes, but the protein's density is higher. Hmm, this might be a point where I made a mistake.)

Wait, the ribosome has a density of 1 g/cm³, and contains 40% protein by mass. So the mass of protein is 40% of the ribosomal mass. But the density of the proteins themselves is higher, so their volume would be less than 40% of the ribosome's volume.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The mass of the protein is 40% of the ribosome's mass. The ribosome's mass is volume_ribosome * density_ribosome. So, mass_protein = 0.4 * (vol_rib * 1 g/cm³).

Then, the volume of the protein would be mass_protein / density_protein. But since I don't know the density of the protein, perhaps I can ignore it because when the proteins are stretched out, their volume is the same as before. Wait, but when you stretch a protein into a fiber, the volume remains the same, but the shape changes. So, the volume of the protein is mass_protein / density_protein. If I don't know the density, perhaps I can't proceed that way.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the density of the protein and just use the mass to find the length, assuming a certain mass per unit length.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies by considering that the volume of the proteins is 40% of the ribosome's volume. Because the ribosome's density is 1 g/cm³, then 40% of the volume is protein. Wait, no, because the 40% is by mass, not volume. So if the density of the protein is higher than the ribosome's, the volume occupied by protein would be less than 40% of the ribosome's volume.

Hmm, perhaps this is complicating things. Let me think again. The question is about the length of the polypeptide chains when stretched out. So perhaps the key is to find the total number of amino acids and multiply by the length per amino acid.

Wait, the earlier calculation gave me 1.534e8 amino acids, each contributing 3.5 Å, for a total length of 5.369e8 Å.

Wait, 5.369e8 Å is 5.369e8 * 1e-4 micrometers (since 1e4 Å = 1 micrometer), so 5.369e8 * 1e-4 = 5.369e4 micrometers, which is 53,690 micrometers.

Wait, wait, that's a different approach. Let me try:

1 micrometer is 1e4 Å (since 1e4 Å = 1e-6 m = 1 micrometer).

So 5.369e8 Å = 5.369e8 / 1e4 micrometers = 5.369e4 micrometers.

Wait, that's 53,690 micrometers, which is 53.69 millimeters.

Wait, but the E. coli's circumference is 1 micron (since diameter is 1 micron; circumference is π * 1e-6 m = 3.14e-6 m = 3.14 micrometers).

So the number of times is total length (53,690 micrometers) divided by circumference (3.14 micrometers).

So 53,690 / 3.14 ≈ 17,100 times. So approximately 1.71e4 times.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.76e4, which is close. Maybe I have some rounding errors.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate with more precise numbers.

So let me recompute each step precisely.

1. Volume of a ribosome: (4/3)πr³.

r = 90 Å = 90e-8 cm = 9e-7 cm.

Volume = (4/3)*π*(9e-7)^3.

Compute (9e-7)^3: 729e-21 cm³ = 7.29e-19 cm³.

Multiply by (4/3)π: 4.18879 * 7.29e-19 = ?

4.18879 *7.29e-19: let's compute 4 *7.29e-19 = 29.16e-19; 0.18879 *7.29e-19 ≈ (approx 0.18879 *7.29)= approx 1.376, so 1.376e-19.

Total ≈ 29.16e-19 +1.376e-19 = 30.536e-19 = 3.0536e-18 cm³ per ribosome.

Mass of ribosome: volume * density = 3.0536e-18 g (since density is 1g/cm³).

Protein mass per ribosome: 0.4 * 3.0536e-18 = 1.22144e-18 g.

Total protein for 25,000 ribosomes: 25,000 * 1.22144e-18 = 3.0536e-14 g.

Molar mass of amino acid = 120 g/mol.

Moles of amino acids = 3.0536e-14 / 120 = 2.54467e-16 mol.

Number of amino acids = moles * Avogadro = 2.54467e-16 *6.022e23 = ?

Calculate 2.
