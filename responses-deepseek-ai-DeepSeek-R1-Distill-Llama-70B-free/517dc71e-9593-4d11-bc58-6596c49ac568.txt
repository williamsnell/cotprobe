Okay, so I need to figure out this compass and straightedge construction problem. The question is about whether we can construct the edge length of a cube such that its volume is X times the volume of a given cube. X is from the set {3,17,8,27,343,1331}, and for each X, I have to return 1 if it's possible and 0 if not.

Hmm, I remember that compass and straightedge constructions are limited to certain operations. They can do things like adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing lengths, and taking square roots. But cube roots are tricky because they might not be constructible in general.

The volume of a cube is edge length cubed. So if the original cube has edge length 'a', its volume is a³. The new cube should have a volume X times that, so X*a³. Let's call the new edge length 'b'. Then, b³ = X*a³. To find b, we take the cube root of (X*a³), which is a * cube_root(X). 

So the question boils down to: for each X in the set, is the cube root of X a constructible number? Because if I can construct the cube root of X, then I can multiply it by the given edge length 'a' (which is constructible since it's given) to get the new edge length 'b'.

Wait, but wait. Constructibility with compass and straightedge isn't just about taking roots. It's about whether the number is a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients of degree 2^n, where n is a finite number. So cube roots would correspond to degree 3, which isn't a power of 2, so they're not constructible unless the cube root is an integer or perhaps a rational number.

Wait, cube roots of integers... Let's think. The cube root of 8 is 2, which is an integer. So for X=8, the cube root is 2, which is obviously constructible. Similarly, X=27, cube root is 3, which is also constructible. X=343 is 7³, so cube root is 7. X=1331 is 11³, cube root is 11.

What about the others? X=3, cube root is around 1.442, which is irrational. X=17, cube root is about 2.571, also irrational.

Wait, but wait again. So for a number to be constructible, it's necessary that it can be expressed using a finite number of additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, and square roots. Cube roots can't be expressed that way unless they're integers or perhaps rational. Because if you have a cube root that's not an integer, you can't construct it with just those operations. For example, cube root of 2 is not constructible with compass and straightedge.

So applying that, let's go through each X:

1. X=3: cube root is irrational, not constructible. So no, 0.
2. X=17: same issue, cube root is irrational. No, 0.
3. X=8: cube root is 2, which is constructible. Yes, 1.
4. X=27: cube root is 3. Yes, 1.
5. X=343: cube root is 7. Yes, 1.
6. X=1331: cube root is 11. Yes, 1.

Wait wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check X=343. 7³ is 343. So yes, cube root is 7. Similarly, 11³ is 1331. So yes for those.

Wait, but the initial problem says that X is from the set {3,17,8,27,343,1331}, and the order matters. So the order in the answer should correspond to each X in that order.

So for each X:

3 → 0

17 →0

8 →1

27 →1

343→1

1331 →1

So the resulting list is [0,0,1,1,1,1]. Looking at the options, which option matches this?

Looking at the options, option C is [0,0,1,1,1,1], which matches. So the answer is C.

Wait, but wait again. Let me double-check the options. Let me look back:

Options:

A: [1,0,1,0,1,0]

B: [1,1,0,0,0,0]

C: [0,0,1,1,1,1]

D: [0,1,1,1,0,0]

E: [0,1,1,0,0,1]

F: [0,1,0,1,0,1]

G: [0,0,0,0,0,0]

H: [1,1,1,0,0,1]

I: [1,1,1,1,1,1]

J: [1,0,0,1,1,0]

Yes, option C is [0,0,1,1,1,1], which is exactly what I have. So the answer is option C.

To determine whether we can use compass and straightedge construction to construct the edge length of a cube with a volume equal to \( X \) times the volume of a given cube, we analyze the constructibility of the cube root of \( X \). 

The volume of a cube is proportional to the cube of its edge length. If the original cube has edge length \( a \), its volume is \( a^3 \). For the new cube to have a volume \( X \cdot a^3 \), its edge length must be \( a \cdot \sqrt[3]{X} \). Compass and straightedge constructions can only construct numbers that are solutions to polynomial equations of degree \( 2^n \), where \( n \) is a finite integer. Cube roots, which correspond to degree 3, are not constructible unless \( X \) is a perfect cube.

### Analysis of Each \( X \):
1. **\( X = 3 \):** \( \sqrt[3]{3} \) is irrational and not constructible. **Result: 0**.
2. **\( X = 17 \):** \( \sqrt[3]{17} \) is irrational and not constructible. **Result: 0**.
3. **\( X = 8 \):** \( \sqrt[3]{8} = 2 \), which is an integer and constructible. **Result: 1**.
4. **\( X = 27 \):** \( \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \), which is an integer and constructible. **Result: 1**.
5. **\( X = 343 \):** \( \sqrt[3]{343} = 7 \), which is an integer and constructible. **Result: 1**.
6. **\( X = 1331 \):** \( \sqrt[3]{1331} = 11 \), which is an integer and constructible. **Result: 1**.

### Final Answer List:
For \( X = \{3, 17, 8, 27, 343, 1331\} \), the results are \([0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\).

### Matching Option:
The correct option is **C: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]**.
