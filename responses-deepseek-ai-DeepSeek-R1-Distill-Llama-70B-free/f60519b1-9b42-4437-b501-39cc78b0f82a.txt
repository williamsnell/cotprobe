Question:

A previously healthy 27-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of moderate-to-severe pain and swelling of the left labia. She is sexually active and uses condoms inconsistently. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 115/75 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a 4 x 3-cm, tender, fluctuant mass medial to the left labium majus compromising the introital opening. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Administration of intravenous vancomycin
B: Incision and drainage
C: Administration of intravenous ceftriaxone
D: Administration of intravenous metronidazole
E: Observation and re-evaluation in 24 hours
F: Administration of oral antibiotics
G: Administration of intravenous penicillin G
H: Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of the mass
I: Initiation of antiviral therapy
J: Surgical excision of the mass

Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The patient is a 27-year-old woman who's nulligravid, meaning she's never been pregnant. She comes to the ED with a 2-day history of moderate to severe pain and swelling in her left labia. She's sexually active and uses condoms inconsistently. Her vital signs are mostly normal—temp 37.2°C, which is just a bit above normal but not high. Pulse is 92, which is slightly elevated but not too bad. Respirations 18, BP 115/75, all within normal ranges.

On pelvic exam, there's a 4x3 cm mass that's tender and fluctuant, located medial to the left labium majus, and it's affecting the introital opening. So, fluctuant suggests it's filled with fluid, like a cyst or abscess.

The question is asking for the next step in management. The options are various treatments, mostly antibiotics or procedures.

Hmm. So, what's the differential diagnosis here? The key points are the location (labia), the description (tender, fluctuant mass), and the patient's sexual activity.

Possible considerations could include Bartholin's gland abscess or cyst, an inguinal lymph node abscess, or maybe a tubo-ovarian abscess, but the location is more in line with Bartholin's. Bartholin glands are located near the vaginal opening, two on each side. If the gland gets blocked, it can form a cyst, and if it becomes infected, an abscess.

Bartholin's abscess typically presents as a painful, swollen mass near the labia. It can cause significant discomfort and may interfere with activities like walking or sitting. In this case, the mass is 4x3 cm, which is pretty sizable, and it's fluctuant, so drainage might be necessary.

So, the next step would likely be an incision and drainage (I&D) of the abscess. But wait, what about antibiotics? Since the patient is sexually active and uses condoms inconsistently, there's a possibility of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) like gonorrhea or chlamydia causing the abscess. However, Bartholin's abscesses are often polymicrobial, involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

But the immediate step is usually drainage because the abscess won't resolve with antibiotics alone. After drainage, antibiotics may be needed if there's a surrounding infection or if the causative organisms require it. But in many cases, especially if the abscess is drained completely, antibiotics might not be necessary unless there's evidence of cellulitis or systemic infection.

Looking at the options, option B is incision and drainage. Option H is ultrasound-guided needle aspiration. Needle aspiration might be less invasive, but if the abscess is large and fluctuant, I&D would be more definitive. Also, in an emergency setting, ultrasound guidance might not be immediately available, but in this case, it's mentioned as an option.

Alternatively, if the patient is stable and the abscess is accessible, I&D is the standard treatment. So, I think B is the right answer.

Wait, but some sources say that for Bartholin's abscess, especially in sexually active young women, considering STI as a cause is important. So, should we culture the abscess material? But the question is about the next step, not about whether to culture.

In terms of management, the first step is usually drainage. So, the answer should be B: Incision and drainage.

The patient is a 27-year-old nulligravid woman presenting with a 2-day history of moderate-to-severe pain and swelling of the left labia. She is sexually active and uses condoms inconsistently. On examination, a 4x3-cm tender, fluctuant mass is noted medial to the left labium majus, compromising the introital opening. The most likely diagnosis is a Bartholin's gland abscess, which typically presents as a painful, swollen, and fluctuant mass near the labia.

The immediate management of a Bartholin's abscess involves incision and drainage (I&D) to relieve symptoms and prevent further complications. While antibiotics may be considered if there is evidence of surrounding cellulitis or systemic infection, they are not a substitute for drainage in this case. Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration (option H) is less definitive for a large, fluctuant abscess, and I&D is the standard treatment. Other options, such as administration of antibiotics or observation, are not appropriate as the next step.

The most appropriate next step in management is **incision and drainage**.
