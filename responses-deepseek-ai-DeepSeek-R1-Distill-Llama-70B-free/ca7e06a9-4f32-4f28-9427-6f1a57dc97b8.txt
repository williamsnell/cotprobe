Okay, so I've got this problem where a particle moves along the curve y = x³/2, and the distance from the origin along the curve is given by s = t³. I need to find the acceleration when t = 2 seconds. Hmm, this seems like a kinematics problem involving parametric equations and moving along a curve. I remember that acceleration in such cases has two components: tangential and normal. 

Wait, right, the acceleration vector a can be broken down into the tangential acceleration a_t and the normal (or centripetal) acceleration a_n. The formula I think is a = a_t * T + a_n * N, where T and N are the unit tangent and unit normal vectors, respectively.

So first, I need to find the position of the particle as a function of time. The position is along the curve y = x³/2, so maybe I can write x and y as functions of a parameter, say u, which could be related to s or t. But here, s is given as t³, and s is the arc length. So perhaps the particle's position is parameterized by the arc length s, which is a function of time t.

Wait, the arc length s from the origin to a point (x,y) on the curve is given by s = t³. So s is a function of t. I need to express x and y in terms of t, then find the derivatives to get velocity and acceleration.

Alternatively, since s is the arc length, we can relate ds/dt to the speed. Because speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector, which is ds/dt. Oh right, because s is the distance along the curve, so ds/dt is the speed.

So v = ds/dt. Since s = t³, then ds/dt = 3t². So at t=2, v = 3*(2)^2 = 12 in/sec.

But wait, velocity is a vector. So the velocity vector v has a magnitude of v=12, and direction given by the tangent to the curve at that point.

Now, the acceleration. Acceleration has two components: dv/dt (the rate of change of speed, which is the tangential acceleration), and (v²)/R, where R is the radius of curvature (the normal component).

So first, let's find the position x and y as functions of s, then express them in terms of t, or perhaps find x and y in terms of s and then relate s to t.

Wait, the curve is y = x³/2. To find the arc length s as a function of x, the formula for arc length is s = ∫√(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx from x=0 to x. So let's compute dy/dx.

dy/dx = (3x²)/2. So (dy/dx)^2 = (9x^4)/4. Then 1 + (dy/dx)^2 = 1 + (9x^4)/4. So the integrand becomes sqrt(1 + (9x^4)/4). Hmm, that might be complicated to integrate, but perhaps there's a substitution or another approach.

Wait, but we have s = t³, and we need to find the relation between x and s. So s = ∫ from 0 to x of sqrt(1 + (9x'^4)/4) dx'. But integrating this seems tricky. Maybe instead of integrating, we can find a differential equation relating ds/dx and then express x in terms of s.

Alternatively, since s is given as a function of time, and the particle's position is on the curve, perhaps we can parameterize x and y in terms of s. Wait, but s is the arc length parameter. So perhaps x and y can be expressed as functions of s, which is a function of t.

Wait, let me think again. The arc length s is given by s = t³. So t = s^(1/3). But I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.

Wait, perhaps I need to express x in terms of s. Let me try that. The differential arc length is ds = sqrt(1 + (dy/dx)^2) dx. So ds = sqrt(1 + (9x^4)/4) dx. So rearranged, dx/ds = 1 / sqrt(1 + 9x^4/4) = 2 / sqrt(9x^4 +4).

Hmm, but this seems complicated to integrate, so maybe I can find expressions for dx/dt and dy/dt, or perhaps find the derivatives using the chain rule.

Alternatively, maybe we can express x and y as functions of s, and then since s is a function of t, express x and y as functions of t, then find velocity and acceleration.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to parameterize the curve with a parameter, say θ, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can express x as a function of s, then find dx/dt using the chain rule.

Wait, let's think: s is a function of x, so s = ∫0^x sqrt(1 + (9x'^4)/4) dx'. So, s = ∫0^x (sqrt(9x'^4 +4 )) / 2 dx'. Hmm, that integral looks challenging. Maybe a substitution: let u = x'^2. Then du = 2x' dx'. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps approximate or use a series expansion, but that's probably not the way to go.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since s = t³, and s is the arc length, then maybe I can find x as a function of s, and then express x in terms of t, and proceed from there.

Wait, let's try to find the velocity vector components.

The velocity vector v has components dx/dt and dy/dt. The speed is |v| = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 ) = ds/dt = 3t², as established earlier.

So, (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 = (ds/dt)^2 = (3t²)^2 = 9t^4.

But dy/dx = (3x²)/2, so dy/dt = dy/dx * dx/dt = (3x²/2) dx/dt.

So, (dx/dt)^2 + ( (3x²/2 dx/dt) )^2 = 9t^4.

Factor out (dx/dt)^2:

(dx/dt)^2 [1 + (9x^4)/4] = 9t^4.

So, (dx/dt)^2 = (9t^4) / [1 + (9x^4)/4 ]

Taking square root:

dx/dt = (3t²) / sqrt(1 + (9x^4)/4 )

Hmm, but this seems tricky because x is a function of t. Maybe I can express x in terms of s, and then s in terms of t.

Wait, perhaps I can find a relation between x and s. Since s is the arc length, and from earlier, we have ds = sqrt(1 + (9x^4)/4) dx.

Wait, so ds/dx = sqrt(1 + (9x^4)/4).

Which gives, dx/ds = 1 / sqrt(1 + (9x^4)/4).

But then, dx/dt = dx/ds * ds/dt = [1 / sqrt(1 + (9x^4)/4)] * (3t²).

Hmm, but this still leaves me with x as a function of t, which I don't have.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the radius of curvature R at a general point x on the curve, which would help in finding the normal component of acceleration.

The formula for the radius of curvature R is [1 + (dy/dx)^2]^(3/2) / |d²y/dx²|.

So dy/dx = (3x²)/2, and d²y/dx² = 3x.

So R = [1 + (9x^4)/4]^(3/2) / |3x|.

But this might get complicated, but perhaps manageable.

So, the normal acceleration a_n is v² / R.

Wait, let's compute that.

a_n = v² / R = ( (3t²)^2 ) / [ [1 + (9x^4)/4]^(3/2) / (3|x|) ) ]

= (9t^4) * (3|x|) / [1 + (9x^4)/4]^(3/2)

But again, x is a function of t, which I don't have explicitly.

Hmm, perhaps I need to find x when t=2. Let's see if that approach is possible.

At t=2, s = t³ = 8 inches.

So, s = 8 inches is the arc length from the origin to the point (x, y) on the curve.

But to find x when s=8, I need to solve s = ∫0^x sqrt(1 + (9x'^4)/4) dx' = 8.

This integral seems difficult; perhaps I can approximate it numerically, but that might not be straightforward without computational tools. Alternatively, maybe we can find a substitution or another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can let u = x^2. Then du = 2x dx. Hmm, but I'm not sure that helps. Alternatively, maybe substitute x^2 = something.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that for small x, the 9x^4/4 term might be negligible, but when s=8, I'm not sure if x is small. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that when s=8, the integral is 8. So,

8 = ∫0^x sqrt(1 + (9x'^4)/4) dx'.

Let me make a substitution: let’s say x' = (2/3)^(1/4) * u, so that when x' is expressed in terms of u, the expression under the square root becomes 1 + u^4. Let me check:

Let x' = k*u, where k is a constant to be determined. Then,

sqrt(1 + (9x'^4)/4 ) = sqrt(1 + (9 (k u)^4 ) /4 )

We want this to equal sqrt(1 + u^4 ), so:

9 k^4 /4 =1 → k^4 = 4/9 → k = (4/9)^(1/4) = [ (2^2)/(3^2) ) ]^(1/4) ) = (2/3)^(1/2) )= sqrt(2/3).

So, k = (2/3)^(1/2) = sqrt(6)/3 ≈ 0.816.

So, substituting x' = sqrt(6)/3 * u, then dx' = sqrt(6)/3 du.

So, the integral becomes:

8 = ∫0^{x} sqrt(1 + u^4) * [sqrt(6)/3] du.

So, 8 = (sqrt(6)/3) ∫0^{x} sqrt(1 + u^4) du.

But the integral ∫ sqrt(1 + u^4) du doesn't have an elementary antiderivative, as far as I remember. So, perhaps I'm stuck here and need to think of another approach.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to avoid explicitly finding x(t) and instead use some parametric differentiation. Let me think about this.

We have the curve y = x³/2. So, the position vector r(t) can be written as x(t) ȇ_x + y(t) ȇ_y, where y(t) = (x(t))³ / 2.

The velocity vector v(t) is dr/dt = dx/dt ȇ_x + dy/dt ȇ_y.

The speed v is |v| = sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 ) = ds/dt = 3t², as established before.

So, dy/dt = (3x²/2) dx/dt.

Therefore, v^2 = (dx/dt)^2 + ( (3x²/2 dx/dt ) )^2 = (dx/dt)^2 (1 + (9x^4)/4 ).

So, dx/dt = v / sqrt(1 + (9x^4)/4 ) = (3t²) / sqrt(1 + (9x^4)/4 ).

But again, x is a function of t, which we don't have.

Wait, but perhaps at t=2, s=8, and we can find x(2). Let's see, maybe using series expansion or substitution.

Wait, another approach: Since s = ∫0^x sqrt(1 + (9x'^4)/4) dx' = 8.

Let me approximate the integral numerically. Let's say I use a numerical method like the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule to approximate x when s=8.

But without a calculator, this might be time-consuming, but perhaps I can make an educated guess or find a substitution that simplifies the integral.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to find expressions without explicitly evaluating x, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can express the acceleration in terms of x and then find the relation between x and s, and from s=8, find x.

Wait, the acceleration components are a_t = dv/dt and a_n = v² / R.

We have v = 3t². So dv/dt = 6t. At t=2, a_t = 12 in/sec².

So, that's the tangential component. Now, the normal component is a_n = v² / R.

We need R, the radius of curvature, which we found earlier as R = [1 + (dy/dx)^2]^(3/2) / |d²y/dx²|.

So, dy/dx = 3x²/2. (dy/dx)^2 = 9x^4/4.

d²y/dx² = 3x.

So, R = [1 + (9x^4)/4]^(3/2) / |3x|.

So, a_n = (v²) / R = ( (3t²)^2 ) * |3x| / [1 + (9x^4)/4]^(3/2).

At t=2, this becomes:

a_n = (9*4) * 3|x| / [1 + (9x^4)/4]^(3/2)

= 36 * 3|x| / [1 + (9x^4)/4]^(3/2)

= 108 |x| / [1 + (9x^4)/4]^(3/2).

Hmm, but again, I need x at t=2, which is when s=8.

Wait, perhaps I can find x when s=8 by using the relation s = ∫0^x sqrt(1 + (9x'^4)/4) dx' = 8.

Let me make a substitution: let’s let u = x'^2. Then du = 2x' dx', so dx' = du/(2√u).

Wait, substituting into the integral:

s = ∫0^x sqrt(1 + (9x'^4)/4) dx' = ∫0^{x^2} sqrt(1 + (9u²)/4) * du/(2√u).

Hmm, that might not help much. Alternatively, perhaps approximate numerically.

Wait, let me try to approximate x when s=8. Let's consider that for large x, the term 9x^4/4 dominates, so sqrt(1 + 9x^4/4) ≈ (3x^2)/2.

So, s ≈ ∫0^x (3x'^2/2) dx' = (x'^3)/2 evaluated from 0 to x → x³/2.

Wait, but s=8, so x³/2 ≈8 → x≈2.

But wait, that's an approximation for large x. Let me check if x=2 gives s=8.

Wait, when x=2, s ≈ 8. Let's compute more accurately.

Wait, s = ∫0^2 sqrt(1 + (9x^4)/4) dx.

But for x=2, 9*(2)^4 /4 = 9*16 /4 = 36. So sqrt(1 + 36) = sqrt(37) ≈6.082.

So, the integrand at x=2 is about 6.082. If I approximate the integral using the trapezoidal rule, maybe.

But perhaps a better approximation: let's take x=2, then s≈∫0^2 (3x²/2) dx → [x³/2] from 0 to 2 is 4. But we know that for x=2, the actual s is 8, so maybe the approximation is off. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is needed.

Wait, another idea: Let me consider that s = t³ and t=2, so s=8. So, s=8, and the arc length is 8 inches. So, the position (x, y) is somewhere along the curve y = x³/2 such that the arc length from (0,0) to (x, y) is 8.

But without knowing x, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I can proceed by expressing the acceleration in terms of x and then relate it using s.

Wait, perhaps I can find a relation between x and s, and then express a_n in terms of x.

But maybe I'm getting stuck here, so let me think about the possible options. The options have specific numbers, so perhaps I can find a way to express a_t and a_n without knowing x, or find a way to relate everything in terms of s and t.

Wait, another thought: The acceleration vector a can be expressed as a = dv/dt * T + (v² / R) * N, where T is the unit tangent vector and N is the unit normal vector.

But perhaps I can find the components without knowing x explicitly. Let me try to outline the steps.

1. Find dx/dt and dy/dt.

We know that v = ds/dt = 3t². The velocity vector has components (dx/dt, dy/dt). The direction of the velocity is along the tangent, which is given by the derivatives of y and x.

Since dy/dx = 3x²/2, so dy/dt = (3x²/2) dx/dt.

So, the velocity vector components are:

dx/dt = v_x,

dy/dt = (3
