Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the work required when a magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic substance. Hmm, I remember that in thermodynamics, when you have a magnetic system, the work done is related to the change in the magnetic field and the magnetization of the material.

The problem says the volume of the substance is 0.1 m³, and it's kept at a constant temperature of 4 K. The magnetic field increases from 0 to (4π/10) weber/m², which I think is the same as 4π/10 T because the unit weber/m² is Tesla, right? Oh wait, no, wait. Weber per square meter is Tesla, so (4π/10) Wb/m² equals 0.4π T. 

The substance follows the Curie equation of state, and the Curie constant C is given as 4π × 10^9 weber·°K/amp·m. Wait, units are a bit confusing here. Let me think. The Curie law is M = C * (B)/(T), but wait no— Curie's law is M = (C * B) / T where C is the Curie constant, but the exact form can vary based on how it's expressed. 

Wait, no, Curie's law is typically M = χ * H, where χ is the susceptibility. Oh wait, but for paramagnetic materials, susceptibility is given by χ = C / T, where C is the Curie constant. So M = (C H) / T. But wait, in some formulations, it's M = C * (H)/(T), but I'm a bit hazy on the exact variables here.

Wait, the problem says the Curie equation of state, so perhaps M is proportional to H over T. So M = (C * H) / T, where C is given as 4π × 1e9 Wb·°K/(A·m). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me check the units again. Oh, maybe the units are weber per ampere per meter, but I'm not sure. 

Wait, the unit for the Curie constant is usually in K·m³/(A·m), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is given as M = (C / T) * B, but I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is M = (C * H) / (T), where H is the magnetic field. Wait, in SI units, B = μ0 (H + M), but for linear materials, B = μ H, where μ is permeability.

Wait, but if the substance is ferromagnetic, but it's following Curie's law, maybe it's paramagnetic in this context? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, ferromagnetic materials are more complicated, but Curie's law is for paramagnets. But the problem says to assume the Curie equation, so perhaps it's M = C * (H) / (T), but perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, the problem says the Curie equation of state, so perhaps it's M = C * (H) / (T). So M is the magnetization, which is in Amperes per meter (A/m), H is the magnetic field in Ampère/meter, T is temperature in Kelvin. So let me see: if C has units of (Wb·°K)/(A·m), then M would have units (Wb·K/(A·m)) * (A/m) / K = Wb/(m²) ?

Wait, Weber is V·s, and 1 Wb/m² is 1 Tesla. So M is in A/m, but if C has units (Wb·K)/(A·m), then when multiplied by H (A/m) and divided by T (K), the units would be (Wb·K)/(A·m) * (A/m) / K ) = Wb/(m²) * (1/m * 1/m) )? Hmm, that doesn't seem to give the correct units for M, which should be A/m. Maybe I'm mixing something up.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation is M = (C * H) / T, and the units for C are such that when you multiply by H (A/m) and divide by T (K), you get M in A/m.

Let me see: (C) * (H) / (T) → M. So C has units (A·m²)/(Wb·K). Because:

[A/m] = C * (A/m) / K → C must be (A·m²)/(Wb·K).

But the given C is 4π × 1e9 Wb·°K/(A·m). Wait, Wb is V·s, but that's a bit messy. Maybe I should just proceed with the given equation regardless of the units confusion.

So, the work done in magnetizing a substance is given by the integral of H dM, or M dB, depending on the variables. Because for magnetic work, the work done is W = integral from 0 to B of M dB, or alternatively, since M and H are related, perhaps we can express it in terms of H.

Wait, from thermodynamics, the work done by the system when magnetized is dW = B dH, or H dB? Hmm, I think it's dW = H dB, because B is the magnetic field (in Wb/m²) and H is the magnetic field strength (in A/m), but perhaps more accurately, the work done is the integral of M dH, where M is the magnetization (A/m).

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again: the magnetic work is analogous to PdV work in gases. So in mechanical systems, work is force times distance, but in magnetic systems, it's more involved.

The general expression for the work done when the system is magnetized is W = integral from H_initial to H_final of M dH.

But M is given by the equation of state, which is M = C H / T.

So substituting, W = integral (C H / T) dH from 0 to H_final.

H_final is the final value of H. Wait, but in the problem, they give B_final as (4π/10) Wb/m². Since B = μ0 (H + M), but for non-linear materials, this might complicate things, but if the material is following Curie's law, perhaps we can express H in terms of B or vice versa.

Wait, no. Let's clarify. B is the magnetic flux density, H is the magnetic field strength. The relation is B = μ0 (H + M), where μ0 is the permeability of free space, 4π × 1e-7 H/m.

But if M is proportional to H, then perhaps we can express M in terms of H, and then express B in terms of H.

Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, we can treat H and B as the same thing, but scaled by μ0. Wait, maybe that's not correct because M contributes to B as well.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.

Given that the Curie equation is M = (C H) / T.

We have to find the work done when the magnetic field increases from 0 to B_final.

Wait, but in the expression for work, should I use B or H? Because the work is done by the external field, and H is the field due to free currents, while B includes the magnetization.

Hmm, but I think the work is given by integrating M dH over the volume. Because in analogy to pressure and volume, the work done is the integral of P dV. In magnetism, the energy is the integral of H dM, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me check the formula. The work done per unit volume when taking H from 0 to H is W = integral (from 0 to H) of H' dM. Since M = (C H')/T, dM = (C / T) dH'. So W per unit volume is integral from 0 to H of H'*(C/T) dH' = (C/(2 T)) H^2.

But wait, the problem gives B_final, not H_final. So I need to express H in terms of B.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem assumes that B = μ0 H, which is only true for vacuum, but if the material is not present, but in this case, the material is present, so B is not simply μ0 H.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is treating the material as a paramagnetic substance where B = μ0 (H + M), and M is given by Curie's law. So substituting M into B's equation, perhaps I can express H in terms of B.

Wait, but let me think: From B = μ0 (H + M). And M = (C H) / T.

So substituting, B = μ0 ( H + (C H)/T ) = μ0 H (1 + C/T ).

Then, we can solve for H: H = B / [ μ0 (1 + C/T ) ].

But wait, the problem gives B_final as (4π/10) Wb/m². So H_final = B_final / [ μ0 (1 + C/(T) ) ].

But that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that M is negligible compared to H, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps in the problem, since we're dealing with the work done, and the equation of state is given in terms of H, it's easier to express everything in terms of H, and then relate it to B.

Wait, but perhaps in the problem, the magnetic field being increased is B, so we have to express H in terms of B.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem just wants us to compute the work done as the integral of M dB, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the basics.

The work done in magnetizing a material is given by W = integral (from 0 to B) M dB.

But since M is a function of H, and H is a function of B, perhaps we can express this in terms of H.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is W = integral (0 to H) M dH.

I think that's the correct approach. So M = (C H) / T.

So, W per unit volume is the integral from 0 to H_final of M dH = integral (C H / T) dH from 0 to H_final.

Which is (C/(2 T)) H_final^2.

Then, the total work is this value multiplied by the volume, which is 0.1 m³.

Wait, but I need to express H_final in terms of the given B_final.

Hmm, because the problem gives B_final, not H_final. So I'll need to find H_final in terms of B_final.

Since B = μ0 (H + M ), and M = (C H)/T.

So substituting:

B = μ0 H + μ0 (C H)/T = μ0 H [1 + C/(T)].

So solving for H, H = B / [ μ0 (1 + C/(T) ) ].

Plugging in the numbers:

Given:
- B_final = (4π/10) Wb/m² = 0.4π T.
- T = 4 K.
- C = 4π × 1e9 Wb·K/(A·m).
- μ0 = 4π × 1e-7 H/m.

Wait, but H has units of A/m. Let me compute H_final.

H_final = (0.4π) / [ (4π × 1e-7) (1 + (4π × 1e9) / (4) ) ) ]

Wait, let's compute the denominator step by step.

First, compute μ0 (1 + C/(T)).

μ0 = 4πe-7 H/m.

C/(T) = (4πe9) / 4 = πe9.

So 1 + C/T = 1 + πe9.

But 1 is negligible compared to πe9, so approximately, 1 + C/T ≈ πe9.

So the denominator becomes μ0 * πe9 = (4πe-7) * πe9 = (4π^2) * (1e2) ) = 4π^2 * 100.

Wait, 4πe-7 * πe9 = 4 π^2 (1e-7 * 1e9) ) = 4 π^2 * 1e2.

So denominator ≈ 4 π^2 * 1e2.

So H_final ≈ (0.4 π) / (4 π^2 * 1e2) ) = (0.4 π) / (4 π^2 * 100) ) = 0.4 / (4 π * 100) ) = 0.1 / (π * 100) ) = 1e-3 / (π * 4) ?

Wait, let me compute that more accurately:

Wait, 0.4 π is in numerator.

Denominator is 4 π^2 * 1e2 = 4 * π^2 * 100.

So H_final = (0.4 π) / (4 π^2 * 100 )

= 0.4 / (4 π * 100 )

= 0.1 / (π * 100 )

= 1e-3 / (4 π ) ?

Wait, 0.4 /4 is 0.1, and 100 is 1e2, so 0.1/(1e2) is 1e-3.

So H_final ≈ 1e-3 / (4 π ) A/m.

Wait, that seems really small. Maybe I made a mistake in the approximation.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should not approximate and calculate more accurately.

Compute denominator μ0 (1 + C/T ):

μ0 = 4πe-7 H/m.

1 + C/T = 1 + (4πe9)/(4) = 1 + πe9.

So 1 + C/T = 1 + πe9 ≈ πe9.

So denominator is μ0 * πe9 = (4πe-7) * πe9 = 4 π^2 (1e-7 * 1e9) ) = 4 π^2 * 1e2.

So H_final = (0.4 π) / (4 π^2 * 1e2 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

0.4 π / (4 π^2 1e2 ) = 0.4 / (4 π 1e2 ) ) = (0.1) / (π 1e2 ) ) = 1e-3 / (4 π ) ???

Wait, 0.4 /4 is 0.1, and 1e2 is 100, so 0.1 /100 is 1e-3.

So H_final ≈ 1e-3 / (π) * (1/4) ?

Wait, no, 0.4/(4 π 100) ) = (0.4 /4 ) * (1/(π * 100 )) = 0.1 * 1e-2 / π = 1e-3 / π.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute it more carefully.

H_final = (0.4 π) / [ (4πe-7) * (1 + (4πe9)/4) ) ]

Compute denominator:

4πe-7 * (1 + πe9 ) ≈ 4πe-7 * πe9 = 4 π^2 e2.

So denominator is 4 π^2 * 1e2.

So H_final = (0.4 π) / (4 π^2 1e2 ) ) = (0.4 ) / (4 π 1e2 ) ) = 0.1 / (π 1e2 ) ) = (0.1) / (100 π ) )= 1e-3 / (10 π ) ) = 1e-4/( π ).

Wait, 0.1/(100 π ) is 1e-3/(10 π )? Wait, 0.1 is 1e-1, 100 is 1e2, so 1e-1 / 1e2 = 1e-3. So 1e-3 / π.

So H_final ≈ 1e-3 / π A/m.

Wait, that's a very small H. But perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should not mix B and H, and instead work entirely in terms of B, but that complicates things because M is a function of H.

Wait, maybe the approach should be to express H in terms of B, as I did, but perhaps the problem is intended to be simpler.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that B = μ0 H, which would only be true if M is zero, but that's not the case here. So that approach wouldn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives the final B as 4π/10 Wb/m², and since in SI units, B = μ0 (H + M ), and M = (C H ) / T, maybe I can substitute.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the work as W = integral (H dB ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The work done in magnetizing a material is given by W = integral from 0 to B of H dB.

But H is a function of B. From B = μ0 (H + M ), and M = (C H ) / T.

So substituting M into B's equation:

B = μ0 H + μ0 (C H)/T = μ0 H (1 + C/(T) )

So H = B / [ μ0 (1 + C/(T) ) ]

So, H = B / [ μ0 (1 + C/(T) ) ]

Now, the differential dH/dB is 1 / [ μ0 (1 + C/(T) ) ].

So, the work W is the integral from 0 to B_final of H dB.

Which is integral (B / [ μ0 (1 + C/(T) ) ]) dB from 0 to B_final.

Which is (1 / [ μ0 (1 + C/(T) ) ]) * integral B dB from 0 to B_final.

The integral of B dB is ½ B_final^2.

So, W = (1 / [ μ0 (1 + C/(T) ) ]) * (½ B_final^2 )

But wait, that gives the work per unit volume? Or is this the total work?

Wait, no, because H is
