Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. It says that X₁ and X₂ are a random sample of size n=2 from a distribution with the pdf f(x) = 3x² for 0 < x < 1. I need to find the probability that the maximum of X_i is less than 3/4. That is, P(max X_i < 3/4), which is the same as P(X₁ < 3/4, X₂ < 3/4).

Wait, so since X₁ and X₂ are both less than 3/4, that's the same as the maximum being less than 3/4. Right, because if both are less, then the maximum can't be more than 3/4.

So, since these are independent samples, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities, right? Because for independent events, P(A and B) = P(A)P(B).

But wait, I think I need to compute the CDF for each, then square it because both need to be less than 3/4.

Wait, the CDF F(x) is the integral of f(t) from 0 to x. So for each X_i, F(x) = ∫₀^x 3t² dt.

Let me compute that. The integral of 3t² is t³, so F(x) = x³ for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.

So, the probability that a single X_i is less than 3/4 is F(3/4) = (3/4)³ = 27/64.

Since the sample is of size 2, and they're independent, the joint probability is [F(3/4)]², which is (27/64)².

Let me compute that. 27 squared is 729, and 64 squared is 4096. So that gives 729/4096.

Looking at the options, option E is 729/4096. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me double-check. The maximum being less than 3/4 implies both X₁ and X₂ are less than 3/4. So it's the same as the joint probability, which is [F(3/4)]². Yeah, that makes sense. So I think option E is correct.

To determine \( P\left(\max X_i < 3/4\right) \), we note that this is equivalent to \( P(X_1 < 3/4, X_2 < 3/4) \). Since \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are independent, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities.

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the given distribution is:

\[
F(x) = \int_0^x 3t^2 \, dt = x^3, \quad 0 \leq x \leq 1.
\]

The probability that a single \( X_i \) is less than \( 3/4 \) is:

\[
F(3/4) = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^3 = \frac{27}{64}.
\]

Since the sample is of size \( n=2 \), the joint probability is:

\[
\left[F(3/4)\right]^2 = \left(\frac{27}{64}\right)^2 = \frac{729}{4096}.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**E: \( \frac{729}{4096} \)**

Answer: E
