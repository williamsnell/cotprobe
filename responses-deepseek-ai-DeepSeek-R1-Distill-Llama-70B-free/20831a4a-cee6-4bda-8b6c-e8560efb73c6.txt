Okay, so I've got this economics question here about cost curves when the price of capital changes. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

Alright, the question says that in the short run, a firm uses labor and capital to produce gadgets. The annual price of capital increases. I need to figure out what happens to the short-run cost curves. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that in the short run, a firm has fixed and variable costs. Capital is considered a fixed cost in the short run because, by definition, the short run is a period where at least one input is fixed. So if the price of capital increases, that fixed cost will go up. 

Wait, but capital is a fixed cost, so the fixed costs increase. So average fixed cost (AFC) depends on the fixed cost. AFC is FC divided by output. If FC increases, then AFC must increase as well. 

Now, let's think about the other curves. Marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of total cost with respect to output. MC is also the change in total cost for each additional unit produced. Since MC depends on variable costs (like labor), if the price of capital (a fixed cost) goes up, does that affect MC? I don't think so because MC is about variable costs. So MC shouldn't shift. 

Wait, no, wait a second. Oh, wait, no, in the short run, capital is fixed. So the cost of capital is a fixed cost, not a variable cost. So when the price of capital increases, it's the fixed cost that's affected. So variable costs remain the same. Therefore, average variable cost (AVC) shouldn't change because AVC depends on variable costs. 

But let's make sure. AVC is (Variable Costs)/Q. If variable costs don't change, then AVC stays the same. So if only fixed costs change, then AFC increases. 

What about average total cost (ATC)? ATC is AFC + AVC. Since AFC increases, ATC must also increase. Because ATC is the sum of fixed and variable costs per unit. 

Wait, but what about marginal cost? MC is the slope of the variable cost curve. Since variable costs don't change, MC remains the same. So the MC curve doesn't shift. 

So putting it together: AFC increases, so the AFC curve shifts upward. ATC increases because it's AFC + AVC, and AFC went up. But the AVC and MC curves don't change. 

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches. 

Option A: MC and AFC up. But MC shouldn't change, right? So A is incorrect because MC doesn't shift.

Option B: AFC up, ATC same? No, because ATC would go up. So B is wrong.

Option C: MC and AVC up. No, because AVC doesn't change. So C is wrong.

Option E: None affected. No, because AFC and ATC do change. E is wrong.

Option F: All curves shift up. No, because MC and AVC don't change. So F is wrong.

Option I: AFC and ATC up. That fits what I thought. AFC increases, so ATC also increases because it's AFC + AVC. So I is a possibility.

Wait, let's check the other options. Option J says AFC and AVC up. But AVC isn't affected, so J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be I. 

Wait, but earlier I thought that ATC increases because AFC increases. So the correct option is I: The average fixed cost and average total cost curves will shift upward.

When the annual price of capital increases in the short run, it affects the firm's cost structure. Capital is considered a fixed cost in the short run, so an increase in its price will lead to an increase in fixed costs. This causes the average fixed cost (AFC) curve to shift upward. Since average total cost (ATC) is the sum of AFC and average variable cost (AVC), and AVC remains unchanged (as it depends on variable costs like labor), the ATC curve will also shift upward. 

Marginal cost (MC), which is derived from variable costs, is unaffected by the increase in the price of capital. Therefore, the MC curve does not shift. Similarly, the AVC curve remains unchanged because variable costs are not impacted by the price of capital.

Analyzing the options:
- **A**: Incorrect, as MC does not shift.
- **B**: Incorrect, as ATC also increases.
- **C**: Incorrect, as AVC does not shift.
- **D**: Incorrect, as costs do not shift downward.
- **E**: Incorrect, as AFC and ATC are affected.
- **F**: Incorrect, as MC and AVC do not shift.
- **G**: Incorrect, as costs do not shift downward.
- **H**: Incorrect, as AFC and ATC increase, not decrease.
- **I**: Correct, as AFC and ATC shift upward.
- **J**: Incorrect, as AVC does not shift.

The correct answer is **I**.
