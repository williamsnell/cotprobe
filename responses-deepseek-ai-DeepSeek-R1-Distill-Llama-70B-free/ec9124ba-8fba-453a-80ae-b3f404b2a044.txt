Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about marketing media. The question is asking which medium is very effective at delivering messages because it allows for detailed explanations that other media can't. The options are from A to J, each representing different types of marketing channels.

Let me think about each option one by one. 

First, option A is Broadcast. Broadcast media includes TV and radio. While they reach a wide audience, TV can show visuals and audio, which is good, but I'm not sure if they allow for detailed explanations as effectively as, say, print or digital where you can have more text.

Option B is Social Media. Social media is great for engagement and reach, but messages are often concise because of character limits or attention spans. So maybe not the best for detailed explanations.

Option C is Direct Mail. Direct mail can include letters, brochures, etc. These can explain things in detail because you can include more text and images. People might keep them longer too.

Option D is Guerrilla Marketing. This is more about unconventional tactics, often creating experiences or buzz. It's more about grabbing attention quickly rather than explaining in depth.

Option E is Digital. Digital marketing is broad, including websites, email, social media. Websites can have a lot of information, so they can explain things in detail. But the question seems to be asking for a specific medium rather than a broad category.

Option F is Email Marketing. Emails can have detailed content, but they are often skimmed, and not everyone reads them thoroughly. Plus, if they're too long, people might not read the whole thing.

Option G is Word-of-Mouth. This relies on personal recommendations. It's powerful but not a medium that allows for detailed explanations; it's more about personal influence and quick messages.

Option H is Outdoor. This includes billboards and posters. These have limited space and time to grab attention, so they can't provide detailed explanations.

Option I is Print. Print media like newspapers, magazines, brochures can include detailed articles and explanations. Print allows for in-depth information because people can read at their own pace and refer back to the material.

Option J is Event Marketing. Events allow for interactive experiences and can demonstrate products, but they might not be the best for detailed, written explanations.

So the question is about which medium allows for detailed explanations that others can't. Print media, like brochures or magazines, can include lengthy articles, providing in-depth information. Direct mail can do that too, but it's a subset of print perhaps. Wait, direct mail is a method, while print is a medium. So the answer could be either C or I.

Wait, the question says "most other media cannot." So which is more effective at detailed explanations. Print media, like magazines or newspapers, can have long-form content. Direct mail, like a brochure, can also do that, but maybe print as a medium is broader.

Alternatively, maybe it's event marketing because you can have presentations and speeches that explain things in person. But that's more verbal, not written.

Hmm, the question doesn't specify written or verbal. But usually, when it comes to detailed explanations, written media allows for more comprehensive information. So I think print or direct mail.

Wait, the options are separate: C is Direct Mail, I is Print.

So the question is which is better at delivering messages with detailed explanations. Direct mail can be quite targeted, but print media can reach a wider audience with the same detailed content.

Alternatively, event marketing allows for live explanations and Q&A, which can be very effective but maybe not as scalable.

Wait, but the question is about delivering messages. So perhaps print is the answer because it's a traditional medium known for detailed explanations.

Alternatively, digital could be, but digital is broad. So maybe the intended answer is Print, option I.

Another angle: the question says "most other media cannot." Which medium is known for allowing detailed, in-depth explanations better than others? Print, like a magazine article, can go into much more depth than, say, a TV ad or a social media post.

So I'm leaning towards I: Print.

The medium that is very effective at delivering messages with detailed explanations is Print. This is because print media, such as magazines, newspapers, and brochures, allows for in-depth written content that can be consumed at the reader's pace. It provides a platform for comprehensive information that other media, like broadcast or outdoor advertising, cannot match due to their time or space constraints. Therefore, Print stands out as the most suitable option for detailed explanations.

Answer: I
