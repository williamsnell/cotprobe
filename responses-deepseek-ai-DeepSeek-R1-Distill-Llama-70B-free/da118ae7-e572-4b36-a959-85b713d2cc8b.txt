Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which factor is NOT a good predictor of which states will get nuclear weapons. The options are A through F. Let me think through each one carefully.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about identifying which option does not predict nuclear weapons acquisition. So, I should consider each option and determine whether it's a known factor in states pursuing nuclear weapons.

Option A: Geographic location. Hmm, I remember that geographic factors can influence a state's security concerns. For example, being in a volatile region with neighboring nuclear states might push a country to pursue nuclear weapons. So, geography does play a role.

Option B: Age of the state. Wait, age... I'm not sure about this one. I don't recall age being a significant factor in whether a state gets nuclear weapons. Maybe it's more about other factors like security threats or economic capacity. So this could be the answer, but I'll keep thinking.

Option C: Regime type. Oh, right! Research shows that regime type can influence nuclear proliferation. For example, some argue that democratic states might have different incentives compared to authoritarian regimes. So regime type is a predictor.

Option D: Wealth/GDP. Definitely, a state's economic capacity matters. Building nuclear weapons is expensive, so a country needs sufficient wealth or GDP to invest in such programs. So wealth is a good predictor.

Option E: Receipt of sensitive nuclear assistance. Yes, if a state receives help, like technology or materials, that's a big factor. For example, the A.Q. Khan network provided assistance to several countries. So this is a strong predictor.

Option F: Rivalry with a nuclear state. Absolutely, security concerns and rivalries are major drivers. If a state has a nuclear neighbor or rival, it's more likely to pursue nuclear weapons to deter threats. So this is a key factor.

Now, circling back to option B: Age of the state. Does the age of a state determine whether it goes nuclear? I don't think so. For instance, both young and old states have pursued nuclear weapons. It's more about the state's current circumstances than how long it's been around. So age doesn't seem to predict nuclear weapons acquisition.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.

The question asks which factor is NOT a good predictor of which states will acquire nuclear weapons. Each option is analyzed as follows:

- **Option A (Geographic location):** A state's geographic location can influence its security concerns, such as being near nuclear-armed rivals, making it a relevant factor.
- **Option B (Age of the state):** The age of a state is not a recognized predictor of nuclear weapons acquisition. Both young and old states have pursued nuclear weapons, and this factor is not directly tied to proliferation decisions.
- **Option C (Regime type):** Regime type can influence nuclear proliferation, as different political systems may have varying incentives for acquiring nuclear weapons.
- **Option D (Wealth/GDP):** Economic capacity is crucial, as developing nuclear weapons is costly and requires significant resources.
- **Option E (Receipt of sensitive nuclear assistance):** Receiving external assistance, such as technology or materials, is a strong predictor of nuclear proliferation.
- **Option F (Rivalry with a nuclear state):** Security rivalries, especially with nuclear-armed states, are a major driver of nuclear weapons acquisition.

Based on this analysis, **Option B (Age of the state)** is the correct answer, as it is not a significant predictor of nuclear weapons acquisition.
