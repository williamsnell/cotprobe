Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about a therapist's responsibilities when faced with a violent threat. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

Wayne W. tells Dr. Pete Pannick that his partner is threatening to harm Dr. Pannick because the partner is unhappy with the advice Wayne is getting in therapy. Dr. Pannick knows that Wayne's partner has a history of violent behavior and believes the threat is serious. The question is what Dr. Pannick should do.

The options are A through D, each suggesting a different course of action. I need to determine which one is correct based on ethical and legal standards for therapists.

First, I remember that therapists have a duty to protect others when there's a credible threat. This is part of the Tarasoff rule, which requires therapists to take reasonable steps to protect potential victims if a patient threatens them or others. So, in this case, since the partner is threatening the therapist, Dr. Pannick must take action.

Option A suggests continuing therapy and asking Wayne to bring the partner to the next session. That seems risky because it involves bringing the potentially violent partner into the therapy setting, which could escalate the situation. Also, the threat is against the therapist himself, so involving the partner might not be the safest approach.

Option B says to continue therapy but contact the police with Wayne's permission. That makes sense because involving law enforcement is a direct way to address the threat. However, I'm not sure if the therapist needs Wayne's permission to contact the police. In some cases, confidentiality can be broken to protect the therapist or others from harm. So, maybe Dr. Pannick doesn't need permission and should just contact the police.

Option C suggests terminating therapy with proper pre-termination steps. While termination is an option if the therapist feels unsafe, I think the primary responsibility is to ensure safety first, which might involve reporting the threat rather than just ending the therapy relationship.

Option D mentions terminating therapy with Raymond, but I don't think Raymond is a character in the problem. Wayne is the patient, so this option seems irrelevant or maybe a typo.

Wait, going back to the Tarasoff duty. The therapist must take steps to protect the intended victim. Here, the intended victim is Dr. Pannick himself. So, the therapist should take actions to ensure his own safety. That might include notifying the police, which would be a responsible step.

But can the therapist breach confidentiality to report the threat? Yes, because the threat poses a serious risk of harm, which is an exception to confidentiality. So, Dr. Pannick should contact the police without needing Wayne's permission, but the option B says "with his permission." Hmm, that makes me think: is permission necessary, or can the therapist act unilaterally?

I'm not entirely sure, but I think in cases of imminent danger, the therapist doesn't need permission to breach confidentiality. So, maybe option B is not the best because it includes getting permission, which might not be required. Alternatively, perhaps the correct action is to contact the police regardless, but none of the options state that without mentioning permission.

Wait, looking again, option B says "with his permission, contact the police." So if Wayne gives permission, that's fine, but if not, can Dr. Pannick still contact them? I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is to contact the police, but since the option includes getting permission, perhaps it's the best available choice.

Option A is risky because it brings the violent partner into the session. Option C is about terminating, but that doesn't address the immediate threat to the therapist. So, the most appropriate action is to ensure the threat is reported to authorities.

So, I think the correct answer is B: continue seeing Wayne in therapy but, with his permission, contact the police. But wait, is it necessary to have permission? Or can the therapist contact the police without it? If the therapist can do it without permission, then option B might not be the best because it includes getting permission. But if the options don't have that, then B is the closest correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is to contact the police without permission, but that's not one of the options. So, perhaps B is the intended correct choice, as it's the only option involving police contact.

The correct answer is B. 

Wayne W. informs Dr. Pete Pannick that his partner is threatening to harm Dr. Pannick due to dissatisfaction with the advice Wayne is receiving in therapy. Dr. Pannick knows the partner has a history of violent behavior and considers the threat serious. Based on the Tarasoff rule, therapists must take reasonable steps to protect potential victims when a credible threat exists. Here, the threat is against Dr. Pannick himself, so ensuring safety is paramount.

Option A is risky because involving the violent partner in a session could escalate the situation. Option C focuses on terminating therapy but does not address the immediate threat. Option D is irrelevant as Raymond is not part of the scenario. Option B, while mentioning obtaining Wayne's permission to contact the police, is the most appropriate choice as it involves taking action to address the threat. Although confidentiality can typically be breached without permission in such cases, B aligns with the necessary steps to ensure safety.

Answer: B
