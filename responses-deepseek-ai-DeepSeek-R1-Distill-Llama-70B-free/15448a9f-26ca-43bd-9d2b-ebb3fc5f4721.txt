Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the first standardized measure of assessment. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about the first standardized measure. I remember that standardized tests have a set format and scoring system, so they're reliable across different administrations. The options given are A through J, each a different psychological test.

I think the Binet-Simon scale was one of the earliest intelligence tests. Let me recall: Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon developed it in the early 1900s. The first version came out in 1905. Its purpose was to identify children who needed special assistance in school. That sounds like it could be the first standardized measure.

Wait, what about the Stanford-Binet? Oh right, that was an adaptation of the Binet-Simon scale by Lewis Terman in 1916. So Stanford-Binet is a later version, not the first.

Looking at the options, option F is Binet–Simon Scale, and option C is Stanford Binet. So if the question is about the first, then F is the answer.

Other options include things like the Wechsler scales (B), which came much later, in the 1930s I think. Rorschach Inkblot (G) is a projective test developed in the 1920s. Thematic Apperception Test (A) is another projective test, but I don't think it's the first standardized one.

Raven’s Progressive Matrices (E) are non-verbal tests, but I'm not sure when they were developed. Holtzman Inkblot (D) is a variation of Rorschach, so probably later. Minnesota Clerical Test (H) and MMPI (I) are personality tests developed in the mid-20th century.

Woodcock-Johnson (J) is a more recent cognitive test, I believe from the 70s or 80s.

So putting it all together, the first standardized measure was the Binet-Simon Scale in 1905. So the correct answer should be F.

The first standardized measure of assessment was the Binet–Simon Scale, developed by Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon in 1905. It was designed to identify children needing special educational assistance and predates other tests like the Stanford-Binet, which was an adaptation by Lewis Terman in 1916. Other options, such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Rorschach Inkblot Test, and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, were developed later in the 20th century. Therefore, the correct answer is:

F
