Okay, so I've got this problem here about polynomials and their degrees. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on polynomial degrees, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the problem says that f(x) is a degree 6 polynomial, and g(x) is degree 3. Then there's this other polynomial h(x), and when we combine f(g(x)), g(h(x)), and h(f(x)), the result has a degree of 36. We need to find the degree of h(x).

Hmm, I remember that when you compose two polynomials, say f(g(x)), the degree of the resulting polynomial is the degree of f multiplied by the degree of g. Because if f is degree m and g is degree n, then f(g(x)) is m*n.

So let's apply that here. Let's denote the degree of h(x) as d. I need to find d.

First, let's compute the degrees of each term in the sum f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x)).

1. f(g(x)): f is degree 6, g is degree 3. So 6 * 3 = 18. So this term's degree is 18.

2. g(h(x)): g is degree 3, h is degree d. So 3 * d = 3d.

3. h(f(x)): h is degree d, f is 6. So d * 6 = 6d.

Now, when you add polynomials together, the degree of the sum is the maximum of the degrees of the individual polynomials. So the overall degree of the expression f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x)) will be the maximum of 18, 3d, and 6d.

Wait, but the problem says this sum has degree 36. So the maximum among 18, 3d, and 6d is 36.

Let me write that: max(18, 3d, 6d) = 36.

Since 6d is larger than 3d when d is positive, which it is because it's a degree. So the maximum is either 6d or 18. So 6d must equal 36, because if 6d were less than 18, then the max would be 18, which is less than 36. So 6d must be 36.

So 6d = 36 => d = 36/6 = 6.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. If d is 6, then 3d is 18. So the degrees of the terms would be 18, 18, and 36. So the maximum is 36, which matches the given condition. That seems right.

Wait, but the options don't have 6 as an option? Wait, looking at the options again. Wait, option C is 6, so that's an option.

Wait, but why isn't 3d being the maximum? Because 6d is larger than 3d for d positive. So 6d would be the one that's bigger, so that's why the max is 6d.

So with d=6, 6d=36, which is the degree of the sum. So the answer is 6, which is option C.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose d was 9, which is option D. Then 6d would be 54, which is larger than 36. But the problem says the sum is degree 36, so 54 can't be the case. So d can't be 9. So 6 is correct.

Wait, another way to think: which term in the sum has the highest degree? It's h(f(x)) which is 6d. So 6d must be 36, so d=6.

To determine the degree of the polynomial \( h(x) \), we analyze the given expression \( f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x)) \), where \( f(x) \) has degree 6, \( g(x) \) has degree 3, and the result has degree 36. 

1. **Degree of \( f(g(x)) \):**  
   The degree of \( f(g(x)) \) is the product of the degrees of \( f \) and \( g \), which is \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \).

2. **Degree of \( g(h(x)) \):**  
   The degree of \( g(h(x)) \) is the product of the degrees of \( g \) and \( h \). Let the degree of \( h(x) \) be \( d \). Then, the degree of \( g(h(x)) \) is \( 3 \times d = 3d \).

3. **Degree of \( h(f(x)) \):**  
   The degree of \( h(f(x)) \) is the product of the degrees of \( h \) and \( f \), which is \( d \times 6 = 6d \).

The overall degree of the expression \( f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x)) \) is the maximum of the degrees of its individual terms. Thus, we have:  
\[
\max(18, 3d, 6d) = 36.
\]

Since \( 6d > 3d \) for \( d > 0 \), the maximum degree is determined by \( 6d \). Setting \( 6d = 36 \), we solve for \( d \):  
\[
d = \frac{36}{6} = 6.
\]

Thus, the degree of \( h(x) \) is 6. Verifying, if \( d = 6 \), the degrees of the terms are \( 18 \), \( 18 \), and \( 36 \), and the maximum is indeed 36, which matches the given condition.

The correct answer is **C: 6**.
