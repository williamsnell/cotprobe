Question:

A taxpayer was notified by the government that her individual income tax was underpaid by $1,012. 69. The taxpayer retained an attorney to represent her in contesting the assessment. During the preparation of his client's case, the attorney suggested that it might be a good idea if the taxpayer hired an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement for the year in question. Following the attorney's advice, the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend, who prepared a financial statement, which the attorney referred to at trial. During the trial, the attorney representing the government called the accountant to testif' about statements that the taxpayer made to him. The accountant's proposed testimony is

Options:

A: inadmissible as violative of the work-product rule.
B: inadmissible, because it would be hearsay evidence.
C: inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's privilege against self-incrimination.
D: inadmissible, because it would violate the taxpayer's right to privacy.
E: admissible, because it was used in the preparation of the case.
F: inadmissible, because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.
G: admissible as an admission.
H: inadmissible, because it would violate the accountant-client privilege.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with privileges and what's admissible in court. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a taxpayer whose income tax was underpaid. She hired an attorney to contest the assessment. The attorney suggested she hire an accountant to organize her records and prepare a financial statement. She did that, using an old family friend as the accountant. The accountant prepared the financial statement, which the attorney used at trial.

Now, during the trial, the government's attorney called the accountant to testify about statements the taxpayer made to him. The question is about whether the accountant's proposed testimony is admissible or not, and which option correctly states the reason.

I remember that there are several privileges recognized in evidence law, like attorney-client privilege, work-product doctrine, and maybe others. Also, hearsay is a big issue, so I need to consider if the testimony falls under any exceptions.

Let's think about the attorney-client privilege first. That privilege covers confidential communications between a client and her attorney made for the purpose of seeking legal advice. But in this case, the taxpayer made statements to the accountant, not directly to the attorney. So would those statements be covered by attorney-client privilege? I think generally, communications made to someone outside the attorney might not fall under that privilege unless certain conditions are met.

Wait, but the attorney suggested hiring the accountant. Maybe that affects it. The work-product doctrine protects materials prepared in anticipation of litigation, like strategies, notes, etc. But the financial statement here was prepared by the accountant, not the attorney, so maybe it's not covered by work-product. Although the attorney used it at trial, the accountant's testimony about the taxpayer's statements could still be an issue.

Next, the accountant-client privilege. I'm not as familiar with that. I think some states recognize an accountant-client privilege, but it's not as broad as the attorney-client privilege. Also, federal courts might not recognize it in the same way. So if this is a federal case, maybe that privilege doesn't apply. Plus, even if it did, there are exceptions. For example, in criminal cases, the accountant-client privilege might not apply, or there might be exceptions for certain types of crimes. But I'm not sure about the specifics here.

Another angle is the hearsay rule. The accountant would be testifying about statements made by the taxpayer. If those statements are being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, then they would be hearsay. But there are exceptions, like admissions by a party-opponent. If the taxpayer is the party against whom the statement is being offered, then her statements to the accountant could be admissible as admissions under FRE 801(d)(2). So that could make the testimony admissible.

Wait, but if the statements were made to the accountant in the course of preparing the financial statement, which was then used by the attorney in trial, does that affect anything? Also, if the accountant was acting at the direction of the attorney, maybe that brings it under attorney-client privilege. But I'm not sure. I think that the attorney-client privilege doesn't necessarily extend to third parties like accountants unless they're necessary for the legal consultation.

So let's think about what each option says. Option F says it's inadmissible because of attorney-client privilege. But I don't think the statements to the accountant are covered by that. Option H says it's inadmissible because of accountant-client privilege. If that's recognized, then maybe. But I'm not sure if that applies here, especially in a tax case.

Option G says it's admissible as an admission. That sounds plausible because the taxpayer's own statements could be considered admissions. Unless there's a privilege that prevents it.

Wait, but if the communication was made to the accountant for the purpose of preparing the financial statement, which the attorney then used, would that fall under the attorney-client privilege? I think the Supreme Court case of Swidler & Berlin v. United States might be relevant here. In that case, the Court held that communications between a client and an accountant, made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice from the attorney, are protected by attorney-client privilege. But in this case, the taxpayer consulted the accountant at the attorney's suggestion. So the communication was made in the course of seeking legal advice.

Wait, no, Swidler & Berlin was about whether the attorney could withhold the accountant's notes under work-product doctrine. But another case, perhaps United States v. Adlman, where the court held that communications between client and accountant are protected when they are made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. So if the taxpayer made statements to the accountant to help the attorney, then those statements might be protected by attorney-client privilege.

But wait, the government attorney is calling the accountant to testify about the taxpayer's statements. So if those statements are privileged under attorney-client, then the testimony would be inadmissible. However, if the accountant's testimony is about the statements, but the statements themselves are not privileged, then it's admissible.

Wait, but if the accountant was acting as an agent of the attorney, then the communication might be covered. So in that case, the communication from the taxpayer to the accountant would be privileged as part of the attorney-client relationship.

Alternatively, maybe the work-product doctrine applies because the financial statement was prepared in anticipation of litigation. But the work-product doctrine protects the documents and materials, not necessarily the underlying information. So the accountant could still testify about the facts, but the documents themselves might be protected.

Wait, the question is about the accountant's proposed testimony, not the documents. So the accountant is being called to testify about what the taxpayer said. If that communication is protected by attorney-client privilege, then the testimony would be inadmissible. Otherwise, it could be admissible as an admission.

So in this scenario, the taxpayer made statements to the accountant at the suggestion of her attorney, to prepare for the case. That makes it seem like it's part of the legal strategy. So perhaps the communication is protected, and thus the testimony is inadmissible. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, in Swidler & Berlin, the court held that the attorney could not be compelled to produce notes that included the accountant's work because it was protected work product. But it didn't directly address whether the accountant's testimony about the client's statements would be barred. So maybe the accountant can testify about what the client said, as long as it's not revealing the attorney's strategies or the privileged communications.

Alternatively, if the statements are considered confidential communications made in the context of seeking legal advice, then they would be protected. So the accountant's testimony about those statements would be inadmissible under attorney-client privilege.

Wait, but in that case, the correct answer would be F: inadmissible because of attorney-client privilege. But earlier I thought that the statements to the accountant might not be covered by that privilege unless specific conditions are met.

Alternatively, if the communication is not covered by any privilege, then the testimony would be admissible as an admission, making option G correct.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to outline the possible scenarios.

1. If the communication to the accountant is protected by attorney-client privilege, then the accountant's testimony is inadmissible (Option F).
2. If it's not protected, then the testimony is admissible as an admission (Option G).

I think the key is whether the communication to the accountant is considered part of the attorney-client privileged communication. The Supreme Court, in Swidler & Berlin, held that when an accountant works at the behest of an attorney, the communications are protected as part of the attorney-client privilege. So if the taxpayer was making the statements to the accountant in order to assist the attorney in providing legal advice, then those statements are protected.

But wait, in that case, the accountant's testimony about those statements would be barred because they're privileged. So the correct answer would be F.

But wait, isn't the attorney-client privilege only for communications between the client and the attorney? If the client communicates directly to the accountant, does that fall under the privilege? I think the answer depends on whether the accountant was acting as an agent of the attorney in facilitating legal advice. If so, then yes, the communication is privileged.

So in this case, the attorney suggested hiring the accountant, implying that the accountant was acting to assist the attorney in the legal representation. Therefore, the taxpayer's statements to the accountant would be considered confidential communications made in the pursuit of legal advice, thus protected by attorney-client privilege.

Therefore, the government attorney calling the accountant to testify about those statements would be trying to get around the privilege, which isn't allowed. So the testimony would be inadmissible under attorney-client privilege, making option F the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes the accountant-client privilege is a separate issue. But I think in this case, since the accountant was engaged at the attorney's suggestion, it falls under the attorney-client umbrella.

So the correct answer should be F: inadmissible because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.

Wait, but another point: the financial statement was used by the attorney at trial. Does that mean the taxpayer waived the privilege by using the document? Because if you use the document in court, you might waive the privilege as to the underlying information.

Hmm. Wait, but the issue is about the statements made to the accountant, not the document itself. So even if the document is used, the underlying communications might still be privileged unless the waiver applies.

I think the waiver would apply if the client discloses the privileged communication, but in this case, the document was prepared using the communications, but the document's use doesn't necessarily waive the privilege for the communications themselves.

So the accountant can't testify about the taxpayer's statements because they're privileged. Therefore, option F is correct.

Wait, but I'm second-guessing because I remember that the work-product doctrine might apply to the documents but not to the testimony about facts. So maybe the accountant can testify about the facts, but not about the work product. But that's a different issue.

Alternatively, the work-product rule protects the materials prepared in anticipation of litigation, but not the underlying facts. So the accountant can testify about the facts, but the financial statement's preparation might be protected. But the question is about the statements made by the taxpayer to the accountant, which are facts, not work product.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The work-product doctrine (Federal Rule 26(b)(3)) protects documents and tangible things prepared in anticipation of litigation. It doesn't protect the underlying facts. So the accountant can testify about what the taxpayer said, unless another privilege applies.

So then, the accountant's testimony about the statements would be admissible unless a privilege applies. So the question is whether the statements are privileged.

If the statements are protected by attorney-client privilege because they were made to an accountant acting at the attorney's behest, then option F applies. Otherwise, if no privilege applies, then the testimony is admissible as an admission (option G).

So I'm back to the initial point: are the communications to the accountant protected by attorney-client privilege when the accountant is acting to assist the attorney in providing legal advice.

Yes, according to some cases. So the testimony would be inadmissible, making F the correct answer.

Alternatively, if the accountant is not an agent of the attorney, but just a regular accountant, then the communication might not be privileged. But in this case, the attorney suggested hiring the accountant, so it's likely that the communication is protected.

So I think the answer is F.

The question revolves around whether the accountant's testimony about statements made by the taxpayer is admissible or inadmissible, and the correct legal basis for that determination. The taxpayer was underpaid on her income tax and hired an attorney to contest the assessment. At the attorney's suggestion, the taxpayer consulted an accountant, an old family friend, to organize her records and prepare a financial statement. The accountant's testimony about the taxpayer's statements is now at issue.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Attorney-Client Privilege**:  
   Communications between a client and an attorney, made for the purpose of seeking legal advice, are protected under attorney-client privilege. In this case, the taxpayer made statements to the accountant at the attorney's suggestion, implying the accountant was acting to assist the attorney in providing legal advice. Courts have held that communications made to third parties, such as accountants, are protected by attorney-client privilege if they are made to facilitate legal representation. Therefore, the taxpayer's statements to the accountant are likely protected under this privilege.

2. **Work-Product Doctrine**:  
   The work-product doctrine protects materials prepared in anticipation of litigation, such as the financial statement. However, it does not protect the underlying facts or communications. Thus, while the financial statement itself may be protected, the accountant's testimony about the taxpayer's statements is not barred by the work-product doctrine.

3. **Accountant-Client Privilege**:  
   Some jurisdictions recognize an accountant-client privilege, but it is not as broadly recognized as attorney-client privilege, especially in federal courts. Even if applicable, the accountant-client privilege may not protect communications made in anticipation of litigation.

4. **Hearsay and Admissions**:  
   The accountant's testimony about the taxpayer's statements could be considered hearsay, but it might qualify as an admission by a party-opponent under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2). However, if the statements are protected by attorney-client privilege, this would override their admissibility as admissions.

5. **Waiver of Privilege**:  
   Using the financial statement at trial does not necessarily waive the privilege for the underlying communications. The privilege applies to the communications themselves, not the document's use in court.

### Conclusion:  
The taxpayer's statements to the accountant, made at the attorney's suggestion to assist in legal representation, are protected by attorney-client privilege. Therefore, the accountant's testimony about those statements is inadmissible because it would violate the attorney-client privilege.
