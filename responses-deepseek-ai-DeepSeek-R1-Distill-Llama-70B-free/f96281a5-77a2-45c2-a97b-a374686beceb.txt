Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the total weekly expenses of several sales representatives. The names and their respective amounts are given, and I need to sum them all up. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.

First, I'll list out each person's expenses to make sure I don't miss any. The names and amounts are:

- Danvers: $203.75
- Halleck: $187.50
- Isaac: $185.00
- Meade: $176.85
- Munez: $163.90
- Wooten: $214.00

Wait, that's six people, right? Let me count again to make sure I didn't miss anyone. Yep, six entries. Now, I'll add them one by one.

I'll start with Danvers and Halleck. So, 203.75 plus 187.50. Let me do that math. 203 + 187 is 390, and 0.75 + 0.50 is 1.25. So together that's 391.25. Hmm, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 203.75 + 187.50. Let me add the dollars and cents separately. 203 + 187 is 390, and 0.75 + 0.50 is 1.25. So 390 + 1.25 equals 391.25. Okay, that makes sense.

Next, add Isaac's $185. So 391.25 + 185. Let me break it down: 391 + 185 is 576, and the 0.25 remains. So that's 576.25 now.

Then Meade's $176.85. Adding that to 576.25. Let's see, 576 + 176 is 752, and 0.25 + 0.85 is 1.10. So 752 + 1.10 is 753.10. Wait, no. Wait, 576.25 plus 176.85... Let me calculate again. 576.25 + 176.85: 576 + 176 is 752, 0.25 + 0.85 is 1.10, so total is 753.10. Yep, correct.

Next up is Munez with $163.90. Adding that to 753.10. So 753 + 163 is 916, and 0.10 + 0.90 is 1.00. So 916 + 1 is 917.00. Wait, no, wait. 753.10 + 163.90. Let me add the dollars: 753 + 163 is 916. The cents: 0.10 + 0.90 is 1.00. So 916 + 1.00 is 917.00. Correct.

Finally, Wooten's $214.00. Adding that to 917.00. So 917 + 214 is 1,131.00. Because 917 + 200 is 1,117, plus 14 is 1,131. So the total comes out to $1,131.00.

Now, looking at the options provided:

A: $1,155.00  
B: $1,250.00  
C: $1,130.00  
D: $1,200.00  
E: $1,131.00  
F: $1,210.00  
G: $1,135.00  
H: $1,145.00  
I: $1,100.00  
J: $1,160.00  

The total I calculated is $1,131.00, which matches option E. So the correct answer should be E.

The total of all representatives' expenses for the week is calculated by summing the individual amounts:

- Danvers: $203.75  
- Halleck: $187.50  
- Isaac: $185.00  
- Meade: $176.85  
- Munez: $163.90  
- Wooten: $214.00  

Adding these together step by step:  
$203.75 + $187.50 = $391.25  
$391.25 + $185.00 = $576.25  
$576.25 + $176.85 = $753.10  
$753.10 + $163.90 = $917.00  
$917.00 + $214.00 = $1,131.00  

The total is $1,131.00, which corresponds to option E.
