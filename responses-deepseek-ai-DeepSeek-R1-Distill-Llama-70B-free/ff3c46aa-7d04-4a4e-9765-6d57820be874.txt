Okay, so I've got this problem here about dew point and relative humidity, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says the air is at 15°C, and the dew point is 10°C. Barometric pressure is 76 cm of mercury. I need to find the relative humidity and the mass of 1 liter of moist air.

Hmm, I remember that relative humidity (RH) is the ratio of the actual water vapor pressure in the air to the saturated vapor pressure at the same temperature. Oh wait, right, the formula is RH = (P_water) / (P_sat_at_air_temp) * 100%. 

So, the dew point is the temperature where the air becomes saturated with water vapor. At that point, the vapor pressure equals the saturated vapor pressure at the dew point temperature. So, the actual vapor pressure in the air is P_sat at 10°C, which is given as 9.2 mm Hg. 

Wait, but air temperature is 15°C, so the saturated vapor pressure at 15°C is 12.8 mm Hg. So RH would be (9.2 / 12.8) * 100. Let me calculate that. 9.2 divided by 12.8 is 0.71875, so 71.875%, which is approximately 71.9%. Looking at the options, that's option D for RH.

Now, the second part is finding the mass of 1 liter of moist air. I think I need to use the ideal gas law. But wait, moist air is a mixture of dry air and water vapor. So I should calculate the partial pressures of each and find their individual densities, then sum them up.

The total pressure is given as 76 cm Hg. Let me convert that to mm Hg because the vapor pressures are in mm. Since 1 cm is 10 mm, 76 cm is 760 mm Hg. 

The partial pressure of water vapor (P_water) is 9.2 mm Hg, as found earlier. So the partial pressure of dry air (P_air) is total pressure minus P_water, which is 760 - 9.2 = 750.8 mm Hg.

Next, I'll use the ideal gas law PV = nRT, and since we're dealing with mass, I'll convert moles to grams. 

For water vapor:
The molar volume at a certain temperature is V = 22.4 liters/mole at 0°C and 1 atm, but since our temperature is 15°C (288 K), the molar volume changes. Alternatively, I can use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles.

The gas constant R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K. Wait, but our pressure is in mm Hg. Let me convert units properly.

Actually, maybe it's easier to use pressure in atmospheres. 760 mm Hg is 1 atm. So 9.2 mm Hg is 9.2/760 atm, and 750.8 mm Hg is 750.8/760 atm.

Let me compute the number of moles for water vapor first.

n_water = (P_water * V) / (R*T)

Wait, but wait, V is 1 liter. So let me plug in the numbers.

P_water = 9.2 mm Hg = 9.2 / 760 atm = approx 0.012105 atm.
V = 1 L
R = 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K
T = 15°C = 288 K.

So n_water = (0.012105 atm * 1 L) / (0.0821 * 288) 

Let me compute the denominator: 0.0821 * 288 ≈ 23.6608

So n_water ≈ 0.012105 / 23.6608 ≈ 0.0005115 moles.

The molecular weight of water is 18 g/mol, so mass_water = n_water * 18 = 0.0005115 * 18 ≈ 0.00921 grams.

Now for dry air. Its partial pressure is 750.8 mm Hg, which is 750.8 / 760 atm ≈ 0.987421 atm.

n_air = (P_air * V) / (R*T) = (0.987421 * 1) / (0.0821 * 288)

Denominator same as before: 23.6608

n_air ≈ 0.987421 / 23.6608 ≈ 0.04175 moles.

Molecular weight of air is given as 28.9 g/mol. So mass_air = 0.04175 * 28.9 ≈ 1.206 g.

So total mass of moist air is mass_air + mass_water = 1.206 + 0.00921 ≈ 1.2152 grams.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D says 1.2346 g. Hmm, my calculation gives about 1.215 g. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the conversion of pressure units. Let me try another approach using the specific gas constant or maybe using the formula for density.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the density of moist air. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, another approach: The density of a gas is (PM)/(RT), where P is pressure, M is molar mass, R is gas constant, T is temperature.

So for each component, dry air and water vapor, compute their densities and sum.

Compute density of dry air:

P_air = 750.8 mm Hg. Let's convert to atmospheres: 750.8 /760 = 0.987421 atm.

M_air = 28.9 g/mol.

Density_air = (P_air * M_air) / (R*T)

R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So density_air = (0.987421 * 28.9) / (0.0821 * 288)

Calculate numerator: 0.987421 *28.9 ≈ 28.56 g/L·atm.

Denominator: 0.0821 *288≈23.66 L·atm/(mol·K) * K → unit is L·atm/mol? Wait, no, the denominator is 0.0821 * 288 = 23.66 (units L·atm/mol).

So 28.56 / 23.66 ≈ 1.207 g/L.

Similarly for water vapor:

P_water =9.2 mm Hg = 9.2/760=0.012105 atm.

M_water =18 g/mol.

Density_water = (0.012105 *18) / (0.0821 *288)

Numerator: 0.21789 g/L·atm.

Denominator: 23.66.

So 0.21789 /23.66 ≈ 0.0092 g/L.

Wait, that's the same as before. So total density is 1.207 + 0.0092 = 1.216 g/L. So mass of 1 L is 1.216 grams. But none of the options exactly match this. Option D is 1.2346 g, which is higher, and Option E is 1.25 g.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation? Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated P_air. Let me see:

Total pressure is 760 mm Hg (since 76 cm Hg is 760 mm Hg). Dew point is 10°C, so P_water is 9.2 mm Hg. So P_air is 760 -9.2 =750.8 mm Hg.

Wait, another thing: when using P in mm Hg, perhaps I should convert to atmospheres correctly. Let me recalculate the n for air and water.

Wait, perhaps the miscalculation is in the calculation of n_air or n_water.

Alternative approach: Use the ideal gas law for each component.

n = PV/(RT)

But for each gas, P is in atm, V in liters, R is 0.0821, T in K.

For water:

P_water =9.2 mm = 9.2 /760 = 0.01210526 atm.

n_water = (0.01210526 atm * 1 L) / (0.0821 * 288 K) 

= (0.01210526) / (23.6608) ≈ 0.0005115 mol.

Mass_water = n_water * 18 g/mol = 0.00921 g.

For air:

P_air = 750.8 mm Hg = 750.8 /760 atm ≈ 0.987421 atm.

n_air = (0.987421 atm * 1 L) / (0.0821 * 288) 

= 0.987421 / 23.6608 ≈ 0.04175 mol.

Mass_air = 0.04175 mol * 28.9 g/mol ≈ 1.206 g.

Total mass ≈ 1.206 + 0.00921 = 1.2152 g.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D: 1.2346 g. Hmm. So maybe I did something wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects using the specific humidity approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should have used the saturation pressure at 15°C for the vapor pressure, but wait, no, the vapor pressure is determined by the dew point. So the actual vapor pressure is P_sat at 10°C, which is 9.2 mm Hg. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the molar volumes correctly. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the conversion of pressure units. Because 1 atm is 760 mm Hg, so when I compute n_water, perhaps I should use 9.2 mm Hg as pressure.

Wait, but in the ideal gas law, pressure should be in atm when R is 0.0821. So I converted correctly.

Wait, is the volume 1 liter? Yes.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the numbers. Let me recalculate n_water:

n_water = (P * V) / (R*T) = (9.2/760 * 1) / (0.0821 *288)

= (0.01210526) / (23.6608) = approximately 0.0005115 moles. So that's correct.

Similarly for air:

n_air = (750.8/760 *1 ) / (0.0821 *288) 

750.8/760 is 0.987421. So 0.987421 /23.6608 ≈ 0.04175 mol.

So 0.04175 *28.9 = 1.206 grams. So mass_water is 0.00921 grams.

1.206 + 0.00921 ≈ 1.2152 grams. So the answer should be around 1.215 g, but looking at the options, the closest is option D: 1.2346 g. Why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculations without approximating so much.

Let me compute n_water exactly.

n_water = (9.2 mm Hg) * 1 L / (R*T)

But converting to atm: 9.2/760 = 0.012105263 atm.

R*T = 0.0821 * 288 = let's compute that exactly. 0.0821 * 288:

288 * 0.08 = 23.04

288 * 0.0021 = 0.6048

Total: 23.04 + 0.6048 = 23.6448.

So n_water = 0.012105263 / 23.6448 ≈ 0.0005115 mol.

Mass_water = 0.0005115 *18 = 0.00921 g.

Now for air:

P_air = 750.8 mm Hg = 750.8/760 = 0.9874210526 atm.

n_air = 0.9874210526 * 1 / (0.0821 * 288) = 0.9874210526 / 23.6448 ≈ 0.04175 mol.

Mass_air = 0.04175 * 28.9 = let's compute this exactly.

0.04175 *28.9:

0.04 *28.9 = 1.156

0.00175 *28.9 = 0.050575.

So 1.156 + 0.050575 = 1.206575 grams.

So total mass is 1.206575 +0.00921 = 1.215785 grams.

Approximately 1.2158 g.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.2346 g, which is a bit higher. So why is my calculation not matching? Did I make a mistake in the approach?

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question uses different units, like considering the volume at 15°C and pressure, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the specific humidity.

Wait, another approach: Using the formula for the density of moist air. The formula is:

Density = (P - e) * M_air / (R*T) ) + e * M_water / (R*T)

Where e is the vapor pressure, P is total pressure.

So,

Density = ( (P - e) * M_air + e * M_water ) / (R*T)

Plugging in the numbers:

P = 760 mm Hg = 1 atm. But wait, wait, no: P is 760 mm Hg, which is 1 atm.

Wait, no, P is 760 mm Hg, which equals 1 atm. So:

Density = [ (760 - 9.2) *28.9 + 9.2 *18 ] * mmHg_conversion / (R*T)

Wait, but wait, the units aren't matching. Because P is in mm Hg, so I need to convert to atm or use R in mm Hg units.

Alternatively, perhaps better to use R in units that match.

Let me try this:

The formula can be written as:

Density (g/L) = [ (P_air * M_air) + (P_water * M_water) ] / (R*T)

Where P_air and P_water are in mm Hg, R is in (mm Hg·L)/(g·mol·K), but wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), but if I'm using mm Hg, I need to adjust R accordingly.

1 atm = 760 mm Hg, so R in mm Hg units would be 0.0821 *760 = approx 62.4 L·mmHg/(mol·K).

So,

Density = [ (P_air * M_air) + (P_water * M_water) ] / (R*T)

Where R is 62.4 L·mmHg/(mol·K).

So P_air is 760 -9.2 =750.8 mm Hg.

P_water =9.2 mm Hg.

M_air=28.9 g/mol, M_water=18 g/mol.

T=288 K.

Calculating numerator:

(750.8 *28.9) + (9.2 *18) 

Compute each part:

750.8 *28.9 = Let's compute 750 *28.9 = 21675, 0.8 *28.9 =23.12 → total 21675 +23.12=21698.12.

9.2 *18 = 165.6.

Sum: 21698.12 + 165.6 =22863.72.

Now denominator: R*T=62.4 *288 = let's compute 62 *288= 62*200=12400, 62*88=5456 → 17856, plus 0.4*288=115.2 → total 17971.2.

So density=22863.72 /17971.2 ≈ 1.2718 g/L.

Wait, that's about 1.27 grams per liter. But according to my earlier calculation, it's 1.215 g/L. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the R value. Let me check. R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), which is equivalent to 0.0821 *760 = 62.36 L·mmHg/(mol·K). So R is 62.36, not 62.4.

So, denominator is 62.36 *288 = let me compute:

62 *288 = 17,856

0.36 *288 =103.68 → total 17,856 +103.68=17,959.68.

So density=22863.72 /17959.68 ≈ 1.273 g/L.

Wait, that's about 1.273 g/L, but earlier I got 1.215 g/L. That's conflicting. So which approach is correct?

Wait, perhaps the confusion is because in the first approach, I treated each gas separately, calculating their moles and masses, then summed. That gave me about 1.215 g/L. 

In the second approach, using the combined formula, I get 1.273 g/L. These are different. So I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Hmm, perhaps the first approach is correct because it directly applies the ideal gas law to each component. Let me double-check the second approach.

Wait, the formula I used in the second approach is correct: 

Density = (P_air * M_air + P_water * M_water) / (R*T)

But wait, R in mm Hg units is 62.36 L·mmHg/(mol·K). So yes.

Let me compute numerator and denominator precisely.

Numerator:

P_air =750.8 mm Hg, M_air=28.9 g/mol → 750.8 *28.9 = ?

Compute 700 *28.9=20230, 50.8 *28.9=1470.92 → total 20230 +1470.92=216, wait, wait, 700 is 700, 50.8 is 50.8. So 750.8 is 700 +50.8.

700 *28.9 =20,230.

50.8 *28.9: 50*28.9=1445, 0.8*28.9=23.12 →1445+23.12=1468.12.

So 20,230 +1,468.12=21,698.12.

P_water =9.2 mm Hg, M_water=18 →9.2*18=165.6.

Sum:21,698.12 +165
