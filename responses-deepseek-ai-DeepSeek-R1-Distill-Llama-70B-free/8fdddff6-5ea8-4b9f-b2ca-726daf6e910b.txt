Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the surface current density when a magnetic field induces a magnetic dipole moment in a material. Hmm, I remember that when a material is magnetized, it creates a distribution of currents, right? And these currents are related to the magnetization M.

Wait, the problem says that the effect of the magnetic field is to induce a magnetic dipole moment per atom of 10^-23 A m². And the number of atoms per cubic meter is 10^27 atoms/m³. Oh right, so the magnetization M is the dipole moment per unit volume. So I think M would be the dipole moment per atom multiplied by the number of atoms per volume. Let me write that down: M = (10^-23 A m²/atom) * (10^27 atoms/m³) = 10^4 A/m. Oh wait, because 10^-23 * 10^27 is 10^(4), so yeah, M is 10^4 A/m.

Now, the question is about the surface current density. I remember that when you have a magnetization M, the surface current density K is related to the component of M perpendicular to the surface. Oh right, K is equal to M times the sine of the angle theta between M and the normal to the surface. Wait, or is it M times the cosine? No, wait, when the surface is inclined at an angle θ with M, the component of M perpendicular to the surface would be M sinθ. Or wait, maybe I should think about it differently.

I think the formula is K = M × n, where n is the unit normal vector to the surface. Alternatively, since K is a surface current, it's the component of M that's perpendicular to the surface. So K is equal to M multiplied by sinθ, where θ is the angle between M and the normal. Because if the surface is at an angle θ to M, then the projection of M onto the direction perpendicular to the surface is M sinθ.

Wait, let me think again. The surface current density K is given by the magnitude of M times the sine of the angle between M and the normal. Because when the surface is perpendicular to M (θ=0), the current is maximum. When the surface is parallel to M (θ=90), the current is zero. So yes, K = M * sinθ.

In this problem, the surface makes an angle of 45 degrees with M. So θ is 45 degrees. So sin(45) is √2/2, which is approximately 0.7071.

So putting it all together: K = M * sinθ = (10^4 A/m) * (√2/2) = 10^4 * 0.7071 ≈ 7071 A/m. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 7070 A m^-1. That makes sense. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, M is 1e4 A/m, right? Because 1e-23 * 1e27 is 1e4. Then K = 1e4 * sin(45). Sin(45) is about 0.7071, so 1e4 * 0.7071 is 7071. So option C is 7070, which is approximately that. So the correct answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the magnetization \( M \), which is the magnetic dipole moment per unit volume. Given that the magnetic dipole moment per atom is \( 10^{-23} \, \text{A m}^2 \) and the number of atoms per unit volume is \( 10^{27} \, \text{atoms/m}^3 \), the magnetization is:

\[
M = \left( 10^{-23} \, \text{A m}^2/\text{atom} \right) \times \left( 10^{27} \, \text{atoms/m}^3 \right) = 10^4 \, \text{A/m}.
\]

Next, the surface current density \( K \) is related to the magnetization \( M \) and the angle \( \theta \) between \( M \) and the normal to the surface. The formula for \( K \) is:

\[
K = M \sin\theta.
\]

Here, the surface makes an angle of \( 45^\circ \) with \( M \), so \( \sin(45^\circ) = \sqrt{2}/2 \approx 0.7071 \). Substituting \( M = 10^4 \, \text{A/m} \) and \( \sin(45^\circ) \approx 0.7071 \), we find:

\[
K = \left( 10^4 \, \text{A/m} \right) \times \left( 0.7071 \right) \approx 7071 \, \text{A/m}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the closest match is \( 7070 \, \text{A/m} \), which corresponds to option C.
