Question:

Attempting to teach a new behavior through the use of aversive techniques is difficult because of which of the following

Options:

A: The behavior becomes more frequent and intense
B: Emotional reactivity is often increased
C: The frequency of behavior is often low
D: It increases the individual's motivation to learn new behaviors
E: The individual develops a positive association with the aversive technique
F: Inhibition co conditioning is encountered
G: It leads to an immediate and permanent change in behavior

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about teaching behaviors using aversive techniques. Hmm, I remember that aversive techniques involve using unpleasant stimuli to decrease a behavior. But the question is asking why it's difficult to teach a new behavior this way.

Let me think about what I learned in psychology. Aversive methods, like punishment, can have some drawbacks. One thing I recall is that punishment might suppress the behavior, but it doesn't necessarily teach a new one. Instead, the individual might just avoid the situation where the punishment occurred.

Wait, the question is about why it's difficult. So possible issues with aversive techniques... Oh right, they can cause emotional reactions. Like, if you use something unpleasant, the person might become anxious or stressed. That could make the learning process harder because they're more focused on the negative emotion than the new behavior.

Looking at the options:

Option B says emotional reactivity is increased. That makes sense because aversive stimuli can cause fear or anxiety, making the situation more stressful.

Option A says the behavior becomes more frequent and intense. No, that doesn't sound right. Aversive techniques are meant to decrease, not increase, behavior frequency.

Option C says frequency is low. I'm not sure. If you're using aversive methods, the target behavior might decrease, but the question is about teaching a new behavior, not reducing an old one.

Option D says it increases motivation. Probably the opposite. If someone is punished, they might be less motivated to engage in the task.

Option E suggests positive association with the aversive technique. That's unlikely because aversive stimuli are negative, so associations would be bad, not positive.

Option F: Inhibition co conditioning. I'm not familiar with that term, but I'm guessing it's a specific concept. Maybe it's a type of conditioning where the individual avoids certain situations, making learning harder.

Option G: Immediate and permanent change. I don't think so. Behavior change from aversive methods might not be lasting and could have other side effects.

So, the main issue with using aversive techniques is the emotional response. The person might develop anxiety or fear, which can interfere with learning. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, another thought. Sometimes, aversive techniques can lead to the individual associating the punishment with the situation, not the behavior. So they might not learn the new behavior but just avoid the context where punishment happens. But that doesn't directly answer the question about why it's difficult to teach.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B because increased emotional reactivity makes the learning environment stressful, hindering the acquisition of new behaviors.

I think I'm confident that B is the right choice here.

The question asks why teaching a new behavior through aversive techniques is difficult. Aversive techniques involve using unpleasant stimuli to reduce or eliminate unwanted behaviors, but they can have significant drawbacks when attempting to teach new behaviors. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Aversive techniques are intended to decrease, not increase, the frequency or intensity of a behavior.
- **Option B**: Correct. Aversive techniques can increase emotional reactivity, such as anxiety or fear, which can interfere with the learning process by making the environment stressful and distracting.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While aversive techniques may reduce the frequency of unwanted behaviors, the question focuses on the difficulty of teaching new behaviors, not reducing existing ones.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Aversive techniques are more likely to decrease motivation rather than increase it.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Aversive stimuli create negative associations, not positive ones.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. While "inhibition co conditioning" might be a specific concept, it is not the primary reason aversive techniques are difficult for teaching new behaviors.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Aversive techniques rarely lead to immediate and permanent behavior change and often result in temporary suppression.

The primary issue with using aversive techniques is that they can increase emotional reactivity, making the learning process more challenging. Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.

Answer: B
