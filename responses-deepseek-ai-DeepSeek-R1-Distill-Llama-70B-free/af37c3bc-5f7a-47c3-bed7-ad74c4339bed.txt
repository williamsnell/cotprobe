Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the importance of the family as a socializing agent and Baumrind's 1967 study. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think through what I know.

First, the question is asking about the role of the family in socialization and specifically about Baumrind's study. I remember that Baumrind did work on parenting styles and their effects on children. So the options should relate to that.

The first part of the question emphasizes the importance of the family as a socializing agent. From what I've studied, the family is considered the primary and most influential socializing agent, especially in early childhood. So any option that downplays the family's role, like saying it's the least important or secondary, is probably incorrect.

Looking at the options, option A says the family is the least important. That doesn't sound right. Option B claims the family's role is secondary to educational institutions, which I don't think is correct either. I remember the family being the first and most impactful.

Now, Baumrind's study. She identified different parenting styles: authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive. She found that authoritative parenting, which is warm and structured, leads to better social and emotional outcomes in children. So her study showed a clear relationship between parenting style/discipline and child personality.

Let me look at the options again. Option J says the family is the first important agent and Baumrind found a relation between discipline and child personality. That fits. Other options like E, F, G, H suggest no impact or only certain styles matter. For example, E says permissive styles have no impact, which contradicts Baumrind's findings because she did find that permissive parenting can lead to certain traits, maybe less self-control.

Option G says authoritarian is the only effective method, but Baumrind actually found that while authoritarian can produce obedient children, they might have lower self-esteem or social competence compared to authoritative. So that's not correct either.

So putting it together, the correct answer should state that the family is the most important socializing agent and that Baumrind found a relationship between discipline and child personality.

The family is recognized as the first and most powerful socializing agent in a child's life, playing a crucial role in shaping their development. Baumrind's 1967 study demonstrated a clear relationship between parenting styles and a child's personality, identifying authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive styles and their respective impacts. Authoritative parenting, characterized by warmth and structure, was found to foster positive outcomes. Therefore, the correct answer acknowledges the family's significance and Baumrind's findings on the influence of discipline on child personality.

J: The family is the first important and most powerful socializing agent in a child's life. Baumrind's study found that a child's personality is related to the type of discipline he receives from his parents.

Answer: J
