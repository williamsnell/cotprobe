Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question has two parts, (a) and (b), each asking about a different component—inductor and capacitor. Both involve calculating their values based on the energy stored when certain conditions are met.

Starting with part (a): I need to find the value of an inductor that carries 2 A of current and stores 20 J of energy. Hmm, I remember that inductors store energy in a magnetic field when current flows through them. The formula for the energy stored in an inductor is something like U equals (1/2) L I squared. Right, so U is the energy, L is inductance, and I is current.

So the formula is U = (1/2) * L * I². I can rearrange this to solve for L. Let's plug in the numbers. U is 20 J, I is 2 A. So substituting:

20 = 0.5 * L * (2)^2
20 = 0.5 * L * 4
Simplify 0.5 *4, that's 2. So:
20 = 2 * L
Divide both sides by 2:
L = 10 H. So the inductance is 10 henrys.

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh right, 2 squared is 4. 0.5 *4 is 2. 20 divided by 2 is indeed 10. So part (a) answer is 10 H.

Now part (b): Find the value of a capacitor with 500 volts across it and 20 J energy stored. Capacitors store energy in an electric field, and the formula for the energy stored is U equals (1/2) C V squared. So U is 20 J, V is 500 V. I'll rearrange the formula to solve for C.

So U = (1/2) * C * V² → C = (2U) / V².

Plugging in the numbers:
C = (2 * 20) / (500)^2
Calculate denominator: 500 squared is 250,000.
So numerator is 40.

C = 40 / 250,000 → let me compute this. 40 divided by 250,000 is 0.00016 farads. Wait, because 1 microfarad is 1e-6 farads. So 0.00016 F is 160 microfarads.

Wait a second, let me make sure. 500 squared is 250,000. 2*20 is 40. 40 / 250,000 = 0.00016 F. Yes, because 1e-6 is a micro, so 0.00016 F is 160 μF.

Now, looking at the options. Let's see each option gives an inductor and a capacitor value. I need to find the option where (a) is 10 H and (b) is 160 μF.

Looking through the options:

Option A: 30 H, 75 μF → No, H is too high.
Option B: 12 H, 140 μF → H is 12, but I have 10. No.
Option C: 20 H, 100 μF → No.
Option D:7 H, 220 μF → No.
Option E:25 H, 80 μF → No.
Option F:6 H, 180 μF → No.
Option G:10 H, 160 μF → Oh wait, yes! 10 H and 160 μF. That's exactly what I calculated.
Option H:5 H, 200 μF → No.
Option I:15 H, 120 → No.
Option J:8 H, 250 → No.

So the correct option is G. So the answers are 10 H and 160 μF, which is option G.

To solve the problem, we calculate the inductor and capacitor values using their respective energy storage formulas.

### Part (a): Inductor
The energy stored in an inductor is given by the formula:  
\[
U = \frac{1}{2} L I^2
\]  
Rearranging for \(L\):  
\[
L = \frac{2U}{I^2}
\]  
Substituting \(U = 20 \, \text{J}\) and \(I = 2 \, \text{A}\):  
\[
L = \frac{2 \cdot 20}{2^2} = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \, \text{H}
\]  

### Part (b): Capacitor
The energy stored in a capacitor is given by the formula:  
\[
U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2
\]  
Rearranging for \(C\):  
\[
C = \frac{2U}{V^2}
\]  
Substituting \(U = 20 \, \text{J}\) and \(V = 500 \, \text{V}\):  
\[
C = \frac{2 \cdot 20}{500^2} = \frac{40}{250,000} = 0.00016 \, \text{F} = 160 \, \mu\text{F}
\]  

### Matching with Options
From the calculations, the inductor value is \(10 \, \text{H}\) and the capacitor value is \(160 \, \mu\text{F}\). The correct option is **G: 10 H, 160 μF**.
