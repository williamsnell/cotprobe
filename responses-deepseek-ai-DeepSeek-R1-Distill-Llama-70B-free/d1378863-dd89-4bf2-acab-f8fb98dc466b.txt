Okay, so I've got this question about frequency modulation and bandwidth. Hmm, frequency modulation, right. I remember that in FM, the bandwidth is determined by something called the Carson's rule. Wait, what was that again? Oh right, Carson's rule says that the bandwidth is approximately twice the sum of the frequency deviation and the modulating frequency. So the formula is Bandwidth = 2*(Δf + f_m), where Δf is the frequency deviation and f_m is the modulating frequency.

So part (a) says the modulating signal is a sinusoid with frequency 3 kHz, and the frequency deviation is 5 kHz. Plugging into the formula, that would be 2*(5 + 3) = 2*8 = 16 kHz. Wait, but wait a second. Does that sound right? Because I think in FM, the bandwidth is actually twice the sum of the maximum frequency deviation and the highest modulating frequency. Oh wait, but in this case, the modulating frequency is 3 kHz, so that's the highest, and the deviation is 5 kHz. So yes, 2*(5+3) equals 16 kHz. So part (a)'s bandwidth is 16 kHz.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option G is 16 kHz and 13 kHz for part (a) and (b) respectively. But wait, let me do part (b) as well.

Part (b) says the frequency of the modulating signal is increased to 4 kHz, and the amplitude is decreased by a factor of 2. Oh wait, how does the amplitude affect the frequency deviation? Because frequency deviation Δf is proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal. So if the amplitude is halved, the deviation should be halved too.

Wait, right! Because in FM, the frequency deviation Δf is given by the product of the modulating signal amplitude and the frequency sensitivity of the modulator. So if the amplitude decreases by a factor of 2, Δf becomes 5 kHz / 2 = 2.5 kHz.

So now, the new Δf is 2.5 kHz and the new modulating frequency f_m is 4 kHz. Applying Carson's rule again, the bandwidth is 2*(2.5 +4) = 2*(6.5) = 13 kHz.

So part (a) is 16 kHz and part (b) is 13 kHz. Looking back at the options, option G says 16 kHz and 13 kHz, which matches my calculations. So the correct answer should be G.

I should double-check the options. The options are:

A: 10 and 7

B:22 and 17

C:20 and15

D:18 and14

E:26 and20

F:14 and11

G:16 and13

H:24 and19

I:8 and6

J:12 and8.

Yes, option G is the correct one.

To determine the bandwidth of a frequency-modulated (FM) waveform, Carson's rule is applied. Carson's rule states that the bandwidth is approximately twice the sum of the frequency deviation (Δf) and the modulating frequency (f_m):  

\[
\text{Bandwidth} = 2 \cdot (\Delta f + f_m)
\]

### Part (a):
- The modulating frequency is \( f_m = 3 \, \text{kHz} \), and the frequency deviation is \( \Delta f = 5 \, \text{kHz} \).  
- Substituting into the formula:  
  \[
  \text{Bandwidth} = 2 \cdot (5 + 3) = 2 \cdot 8 = 16 \, \text{kHz}.
  \]

### Part (b):
- The modulating frequency is increased to \( f_m = 4 \, \text{kHz} \), and the amplitude of the modulating signal is halved. Since frequency deviation is proportional to the amplitude, the new frequency deviation becomes \( \Delta f = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \, \text{kHz} \).  
- Substituting into the formula:  
  \[
  \text{Bandwidth} = 2 \cdot (2.5 + 4) = 2 \cdot 6.5 = 13 \, \text{kHz}.
  \]

### Final Answer:
The bandwidths for parts (a) and (b) are 16 kHz and 13 kHz, respectively. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**G: 16 kHz and 13 kHz**
