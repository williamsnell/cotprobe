Question:

The president of an online music streaming service whose customers pay a fee wants to gather additional information about customers who have joined in the past 12 months. The company plans to send out an e-mail survey to a sample of current customers with a link that gives participants a month of streaming service for free once the survey has been completed. They know that musical tastes vary by geographical region. Which of the following sample plans would produce the most representative sample of its customers?

Options:

A: Choose all of the customers who joined in the last 6 months.
B: From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 10 customers from each state.
C: Choose all of the customers who joined in the last month.
D: Choose a random sample of customers who joined in the last 12 months and have streamed at least 100 songs.
E: Make a list of all the customers who joined in the last 12 months and choose a random sample of customers on this list.
F: From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the city in which they live, then choose 5 customers from each city.
G: Choose all of the customers who have joined in the last 12 months and have streamed at least 200 songs.
H: From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the country in which they live, then choose 5% of the customers from each country.
I: From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the genre of music they most frequently listen to, then choose a random sample from each genre.
J: From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 3% of the customers from each state.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this statistics question. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The president of an online music streaming service wants to gather more info about customers who joined in the past 12 months. They plan to send an email survey to a sample of current customers. The incentive is a free month of streaming after completing the survey. The key point here is that musical tastes vary by geographical region, so the sampling method needs to account for that to get a representative sample.

The question is asking which sample plan would produce the most representative sample of their customers. The options are A through J.

I remember that a representative sample is one that accurately reflects the characteristics of the population it's drawn from. So, the method should ensure diversity across different groups within the population, especially considering factors like geography, which is mentioned as important here.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Choose all customers from the last 6 months. Wait, but the target is the last 12 months. So this would exclude the first 6 months of that period. Not sure if that's a good idea because it might miss trends or differences in the earlier part of the year.

Option B: Classify by state and choose 10 from each. Hmm, if states have varying numbers of customers, just picking 10 from each might not be proportional. For example, a state with a million customers would have way more diversity than a state with just 100 customers. So this could overrepresent smaller states and underrepresent larger ones.

Option C: Choose all from last month. Same issue as A but even worse because it's only one month. It's a very small time frame and might not capture the full 12-month diversity.

Option D: Random sample of those who joined in 12 months and streamed at least 100 songs. That adds a filter based on usage. But this might exclude customers who don't use the service as much, potentially introducing bias. Maybe heavy users have different tastes than casual users. So this might not be representative of the entire 12-month customer base.

Option E: Random sample from the list of all 12-month customers. That sounds like a simple random sample. Each customer has an equal chance of being selected. This should provide a representative sample because it reflects the overall population without bias towards any subgroup. But wait, the question mentions that musical tastes vary by region. So maybe they need to ensure that each region is adequately represented. A simple random sample might not do that if, say, one region has a much larger population and others are smaller. But then again, if it's random, the proportions should still hold in the sample.

Option F: Classify by city and choose 5 from each. Similar issue as B but at a city level. If cities vary in size, this could cause over or underrepresentation. Also, 5 per city might be too small, especially if there are many cities, leading to a small overall sample size.

Option G: All customers in 12 months who streamed at least 200 songs. This is similar to D but with a higher threshold. Again, this excludes less active users, which might skew the data. Not representative of all customers.

Option H: Classify by country, then choose 5% from each. This ensures representation from each country, which makes sense if the service operates in multiple countries. However, within each country, it's a simple 5%, so it's a stratified sample. This could be good because it ensures each country's proportional representation. But it depends on whether the population is spread across countries or if most are in one country. If one country has 90% of customers, a 5% sample from each would mean that country contributes 4.5% of the sample, which might not reflect its actual proportion.

Option I: Classify by music genre, then random sample from each. This stratifies the sample by genre, ensuring each genre is represented. But the question emphasizes geographical region, not genre. So even though this could help in some aspects, it doesn't address the geographical variation which is the key point here.

Option J: Classify by state, choose 3% from each. Similar to B but with a percentage instead of a fixed number. This way, larger states would contribute more to the sample. But wait, if it's 3% of each state's customers, it might not be the same as the overall population's distribution. For example, if State X has 50% of the customers, 3% of State X would be a larger number than 3% of a smaller state. But in a stratified sample, the idea is to have each subgroup (state) represented according to their proportion in the population. Alternatively, sometimes stratified sampling uses proportionate allocation, where the sample size per stratum is proportional to the size of the stratum in the population. If this option is taking a fixed percentage per state, it might not be proportionate. For example, if a state has 10% of the population, 3% of that is 0.3% of the total, which doesn't match the 10% proportion. So this might not be the best approach.

Wait, no. Option J says "choose 3% of the customers from each state." So if a state has, say, 1000 customers, 3% is 30. Another state with 10,000 would have 300 selected. So in the sample, the proportion would mirror the population proportions because each state's contribution is proportional. Because 3% is taken from each, it's a proportionate stratified sample.

Alternatively, option E is a simple random sample without stratification. The question is which is better for representativeness considering geography.

In stratified sampling, when you have heterogeneous subgroups (like states with different musical tastes), stratified sampling can yield more precise results because it ensures each subgroup is adequately represented. So if the population varies by state, stratified sampling by state would make the sample more representative in terms of geographical distribution.

So comparing E and J, which is better?

Option E is a simple random sample from the entire list. It doesn't consider any stratification, so while it's random, it may by chance underrepresent some states if the population is spread unevenly. For example, if one state has a much larger population, the random sample should still represent that, but if you have a small sample size, maybe some states aren't represented at all.

Option J ensures that each state contributes 3% of its customers to the sample. So even if some states have very few customers, they will still be represented. However, if the sample size is fixed, this approach might require a larger overall sample size because you're taking from each state. But given that the question is about the "most representative," it's about accuracy, not efficiency.

Wait, but the question says "the most representative sample." So which method would better capture the variation across states?

Option E may not capture all states, especially those with small populations. For example, if a state has only 10 customers in the 12-month period, a random sample might not include any, leading to no representation from that state. Option J, by taking 3% from each state, ensures that even small states contribute to the sample.

So if the company wants to ensure that each state's customers are represented, stratified sampling (Option J) would be better because it ensures representation across all states, which aligns with the fact that musical tastes vary geographically.

Alternatively, option H does this by country, but the question's focus is on geographical region, which in the US context could be states. So the best approach is stratified sampling by state.

Wait, but looking at option J again, it says "classify by state, then choose 3% of the customers from each state." So in this case, it's taking a proportionate sample from each state, assuming each state's contribution is 3% of their own population. But in stratified sampling, proportionate allocation is when each stratum contributes to the sample in proportion to their size in the population. So if a state has 10% of the total population, the sample would take 10% of the sample size from that state.

Option J's approach is to take the same percentage (3%) from each state, regardless of their size. So if a state has 50% of the customers, 3% of that is 1.5% of the total sample. But if another state has 1% of the population, 3% of that is 0.03% of the total sample. So it's not proportionate; it's actually over-sampling smaller states and under-sampling larger ones.

Wait, no. Because each state's 3% is relative to their own population. So for the larger state, 3% would be a larger number of people than for smaller states. So in the overall sample, the proportion would be the same as in the population. For example:

State A: 1,000,000 customers → 3% = 30,000
State B: 100,000 customers → 3% = 3,000
So in the sample, State A contributes 30k and State B 3k. The ratio is 10:1, same as in the population. So yes, it's a proportionate stratified sample. Therefore, the overall sample would have the same proportion of customers from each state as the population.

So option J is a proportionate stratified sample by state, which would make the sample more representative in terms of geography.

Option E is a simple random sample. While it's unbiased, it might not ensure that all states are represented, especially if the sample size is small. But if the sample size is large enough, it should approach the population proportions.

The question is asking for the most representative. Since stratified sampling can provide more precision by ensuring each subgroup is represented, and the question mentions geographical variation, J would be better than E.

Wait, but wait. The question says "the most representative sample of its customers." So the key is that the sample reflects the entire customer base's characteristics, including geographical distribution.

Option E's simple random sampling is straightforward and usually provides a representative sample. But if certain states have very different musical preferences, a simple random sample might not capture those differences as effectively as a stratified sample.

So in this case, because the company knows that musical tastes vary by region, using a stratified sample based on state (Option J) would ensure that each region's preferences are adequately represented in the survey. This would make the sample more representative regarding the geographical variation in music taste.

Alternatively, Option I stratifies by genre, but the question emphasizes geographical region, not genre. So I isn't the right approach.

So the best options are E and J. Between them, J ensures that each state is represented proportionally, which is better for geographical representation.

Therefore, the correct answer is J.

To determine the most representative sample of customers for the online music streaming service, it is essential to consider the company's goal of gathering information about customers who joined in the past 12 months. The key factor emphasized in the question is that musical tastes vary by geographical region, so the sampling method must ensure representation across different regions.

### Analysis of the Options:

- **Option A**: Selecting all customers who joined in the last 6 months excludes the first 6 months of the 12-month period, potentially missing important trends or differences. This is not representative of the entire 12-month customer base.

- **Option B**: Classifying customers by state and choosing 10 from each state does not account for the varying sizes of state populations. Smaller states may be overrepresented, while larger states may be underrepresented, leading to a biased sample.

- **Option C**: Selecting all customers who joined in the last month is too narrow a time frame and does not capture the diversity of the entire 12-month period. This would not be representative of the full customer base.

- **Option D**: Choosing a random sample of customers who joined in the last 12 months and have streamed at least 100 songs introduces bias by excluding less active users. This may skew the results toward heavier users and does not represent the entire customer base.

- **Option E**: Selecting a random sample from the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months ensures that every customer has an equal chance of being selected. While this is unbiased, it does not guarantee representation across geographical regions, especially if the sample size is small.

- **Option F**: Classifying customers by city and choosing 5 from each city faces the same issue as Option B but at the city level. Cities with smaller populations may be overrepresented, while larger cities may be underrepresented.

- **Option G**: Selecting all customers who joined in the last 12 months and have streamed at least 200 songs is similar to Option D but with a higher usage threshold. This excludes even more customers, leading to a less representative sample.

- **Option H**: Classifying customers by country and choosing 5% from each country ensures representation across countries. However, this does not address the geographical variation within countries, particularly at the state level, which is the focus of the question.

- **Option I**: Classifying customers by the genre of music they most frequently listen to and then choosing a random sample from each genre ensures representation across music preferences. However, the question emphasizes geographical variation, not genre, making this less relevant.

- **Option J**: Classifying customers by state and choosing 3% from each state ensures proportional representation across states. This method accounts for the varying sizes of state populations, making the sample more representative of the geographical distribution of customers. By ensuring that each state contributes proportionally to the sample, this approach aligns with the company's goal of capturing regional differences in musical tastes.

### Conclusion:

The most representative sample is achieved by using a stratified sampling method that ensures proportional representation across states. This approach addresses the geographical variation in musical tastes, which is critical for the company's survey. Therefore, **Option J** is the best choice.
