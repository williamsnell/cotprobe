Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about the Earth's rotation when its mass is redistributed. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with the moment of inertia and angular momentum.

The Earth is considered a uniform solid sphere, and then all its mass is moved into a thin-walled hollow spherical shell of the same radius. I need to find out the new rotation period and the fraction of kinetic energy lost.

Wait, right. When the mass distribution changes, the moment of inertia changes, which affects rotation. Since angular momentum is conserved (assuming no external torques), the angular velocity will change.

I remember that for a solid sphere, the moment of inertia is (2/5)MR², and for a hollow sphere (a thin shell), it's (2/3)MR². Oh wait, no, wait. A thin-walled hollow sphere would have I = (2/3)MR². Because the mass is all at radius R, so I think that's correct.

So initially, the Earth is a solid sphere. Let's call the initial moment of inertia I_initial = (2/5)MR². The final moment of inertia, I_final, would be (2/3)MR².

Angular momentum L is I * ω. Since L is conserved, I_initial * ω_initial = I_final * ω_final.

So ω_final = (I_initial / I_final) * ω_initial. Plugging in the moments of inertia, that's ( (2/5) / (2/3) ) ) ω_initial. Simplifying that, (2/5) * (3/2) ) is 3/5. So ω_final = (3/5)ω_initial. Wait wait, no, wait. Because when I increases, ω should decrease, right? Because if I_final is bigger than I_initial, then ω would have to be smaller to keep L the same. So wait, (2/5) is less than (2/3). So I_initial is less than I_final. So I_initial/I_final is (2/5)/(2/3) = 3/5. So ω_final is (3/5)ω_initial. So the angular velocity decreases by a factor of 3/5.

Wait, but wait, the period T is the inverse of the angular velocity's frequency. Because T = 2π / ω. So if ω_final is (3/5)ω_initial, then the period T_final is (5/3) T_initial. Because if ω is smaller, the period is longer—so the Earth would take longer to rotate.

But wait, what's the initial period? Oh, I think the Earth's current rotational period is about 24 hours. So the initial T_initial is 24 hours. So the new period would be (5/3)*24 = 40 hours. Wait, that's 40 hours. So looking at the options, which one has a 40-hour period?

Looking at the options:

Option H is 40 hours, 2/5 of the initial kinetic energy is lost. Option B is 42 hours, but that's not matching. So the period would be 40 hours, so option H is a candidate for that.

But wait, I'm not done yet. I also need to find the fraction of kinetic energy lost. The kinetic energy of rotation is (1/2) I ω².

So initial kinetic energy, KE_initial = (1/2) I_initial ω_initial².

Final kinetic energy, KE_final = (1/2) I_final ω_final².

Wait, but since L is conserved, KE might change because I and ω change.

So let me compute KE_final as a fraction of KE_initial.

First, express everything in terms of initial variables.

ω_final = (I_initial / I_final) ω_initial.

So KE_final = (1/2) I_final ( (I_initial / I_final) ω_initial )².

Simplify that:

(1/2) I_final * (I_initial² / I_final²) ω_initial² ) = (1/2) (I_initial² / I_final) ω_initial².

But KE_initial is (1/2) I_initial ω_initial².

So the ratio of KE_final to KE_initial is ( (1/2)(I_initial²/I_final) ω² ) / ( (1/2) I_initial ω² ) ) = (I_initial² / I_final) / I_initial ) = I_initial / I_final.

So KE_final = (I_initial / I_final) * KE_initial.

Wait, that's interesting. So the final KE is (I_initial/I_final) times the initial KE.

Because I_initial is (2/5) MR², I_final is (2/3) MR². So the ratio is (2/5)/(2/3) ) = 3/5.

So KE_final = (3/5) KE_initial.

That means the kinetic energy lost is KE_initial - KE_final = (1 - 3/5) KE_initial = (2/5) KE_initial.

So 2/5 of the initial kinetic energy is lost. So the fraction lost is 2/5.

So the time period becomes 40 hours, and 2/5 is lost.

Looking at the options, option H is 40 hours, 2/5 lost. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might mix up the moments of inertia.

I_initial = (2/5) MR² for solid sphere.

I_final = (2/3) MR² for hollow sphere.

So I_initial/I_final = (2/5)/(2/3) = (3/5).

So the ratio of the kinetic energies is I_initial/I_final = 3/5. So KE_final is 3/5 of KE_initial.

Thus, the kinetic energy lost is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. So 2/5 is lost, which matches option H.

So yes, the period is 40 hours, and 2/5 of the KE is lost. So the correct answer is H.

To solve the problem, we analyze the redistribution of the Earth's mass from a uniform solid sphere to a thin-walled hollow spherical shell of the same radius. This change affects the moment of inertia, angular velocity, and kinetic energy of rotation.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Moment of Inertia**:
   - For a uniform solid sphere:  
     \[
     I_{\text{initial}} = \frac{2}{5} MR^2
     \]
   - For a thin-walled hollow sphere:  
     \[
     I_{\text{final}} = \frac{2}{3} MR^2
     \]

2. **Conservation of Angular Momentum**:  
   Angular momentum \( L \) is conserved, so:  
   \[
   I_{\text{initial}} \omega_{\text{initial}} = I_{\text{final}} \omega_{\text{final}}
   \]
   Solving for \(\omega_{\text{final}}\):  
   \[
   \omega_{\text{final}} = \frac{I_{\text{initial}}}{I_{\text{final}}} \omega_{\text{initial}}
   \]
   Substituting the moments of inertia:  
   \[
   \omega_{\text{final}} = \frac{\frac{2}{5}}{\frac{2}{3}} \omega_{\text{initial}} = \frac{3}{5} \omega_{\text{initial}}
   \]

3. **Rotational Period**:  
   The rotational period \( T \) is inversely proportional to angular velocity:  
   \[
   T_{\text{final}} = \frac{\omega_{\text{initial}}}{\omega_{\text{final}}} T_{\text{initial}}
   \]
   Substituting \(\omega_{\text{final}} = \frac{3}{5} \omega_{\text{initial}}\):  
   \[
   T_{\text{final}} = \frac{5}{3} T_{\text{initial}}
   \]
   Given \( T_{\text{initial}} = 24 \, \text{hours} \):  
   \[
   T_{\text{final}} = \frac{5}{3} \times 24 = 40 \, \text{hours}
   \]

4. **Kinetic Energy of Rotation**:  
   Kinetic energy is given by:  
   \[
   KE = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
   \]
   The ratio of final to initial kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   \frac{KE_{\text{final}}}{KE_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{I_{\text{final}} \omega_{\text{final}}^2}{I_{\text{initial}} \omega_{\text{initial}}^2}
   \]
   Using \(\omega_{\text{final}} = \frac{3}{5} \omega_{\text{initial}}\) and \(I_{\text{final}} = \frac{2}{3} MR^2\):  
   \[
   \frac{KE_{\text{final}}}{KE_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{\frac{2}{3} MR^2 \left(\frac{3}{5} \omega_{\text{initial}}\right)^2}{\frac{2}{5} MR^2 \omega_{\text{initial}}^2} = \frac{3}{5}
   \]
   Thus, the final kinetic energy is \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the initial kinetic energy. The fraction of kinetic energy lost is:  
   \[
   1 - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

### Final Results:
- The new rotational period is **40 hours**.  
- The fraction of kinetic energy lost is \(\frac{2}{5}\).

### Correct Option:
From the given options, the correct choice is **H: 40 hours, 2/5 of the initial kinetic energy is lost**.
