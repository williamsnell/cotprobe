Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Reiman and van den Haag's arguments on the death penalty. Hmm, I remember that both of them are philosophers who have discussed capital punishment, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Wait, I think van den Haag is a defender of the death penalty. He argues that it's justified because it serves as a deterrent and because even if it doesn't deter more crimes than life imprisonment, it's still morally justified. He's a retributivist too, I believe, meaning he thinks punishment should fit the crime.

Reiman, on the other hand, is against the death penalty. He probably critiques van den Haag's arguments. But the question is about what Reiman says van den Haag's argument leads to. So, Reiman is interpreting van den Haag's conclusion.

I remember that van den Haag's argument is about deterrence and retribution. But Reiman might point out a flaw in that reasoning. Oh wait, there's something about the idea that if the death penalty is more severe, it's a better deterrent, but it's also more irreversible. So maybe Reiman argues that van den Haag's logic would lead to a conclusion that the death penalty is the ultimate form of justice because it's the most severe punishment.

Alternatively, I think van den Haag's position is that even if the deterrent effect isn't proven, the death penalty is still morally justified because it's a fitting punishment for the worst crimes. So, Reiman might say that van den Haag's argument supports the idea that the death penalty is the ultimate form of justice.

Looking at the options, option H says "the death penalty is the ultimate form of justice." That sounds like what Reiman would attribute to van den Haag's argument leading to.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I might have mixed up their positions. Let me think again. Van den Haag believes that capital punishment is justified because it's a deterrent and because it's morally deserved. So his argument leads to the conclusion that it's justified as the ultimate form of justice.

So the correct answer would be H. But let me double-check the options.

Option H: the death penalty is the ultimate form of justice.

Yes, that makes sense. So according to Reiman, van den Haag's argument leads to that conclusion.

The question asks about the conclusion that Reiman attributes to van den Haag's argument regarding the death penalty. Van den Haag is known for defending capital punishment, arguing that it is morally justified as a form of retribution and because it serves as a deterrent. Reiman critiques van den Haag's position but would acknowledge that his argument leads to the conclusion that the death penalty represents the ultimate form of justice due to its severity and moral justification.

Among the options provided, the one that aligns with this reasoning is:

H: the death penalty is the ultimate form of justice.

Answer: H
