Question:

An avowed corrimunist was elected vice president of a union. A senator, in his investigation of communist infiltration of national labor unions, found a provision in a statute passed by Congress, which makes it a crime for a member of the communist party to act as an official of a labor union. After a subsequent legislative hearing, the communist is dismissed from his position by the union. Which of the following most accurately summarizes the applicable rule of constitutional law regarding the aforementioned provision of the statute?

Options:

A: The statutory provision is a violation of the person's Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment.
B: The statutory provision is a violation of the person's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial.
C: The statutory provision in the act is a form of legislative punishment violative of the Constitution as a bill of attainder.
D: Making it a crime for a Communist to hold a union office is a suspect classification, which violates the equal protection clause.
E: The statutory prohibition is a reasonable method of discrimination since the benefit to the public outweighs the injury or restrictions that would be inflicted upon the person.
F: The statute is valid as it is a reasonable restriction on the First Amendment rights of an individual in the interest of national security.
G: The statutory provision is unconstitutional as it violates the person's right to due process under the Fifth Amendment.
H: The statutory provision is a form of unconstitutional prior restraint on a person's First Amendment right of free association.
I: The statutory prohibition is a valid exercise of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce.
J: The statute is unconstitutional because it infringes upon the individual's right to political affiliation, protected under the First Amendment.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through the question carefully and try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a communist who was elected vice president of a union. A senator is investigating communist infiltration into labor unions and found a statute that makes it a crime for a communist party member to be a labor union official. After a hearing, the communist is dismissed from his position. The question is about the constitutionality of that statutory provision.

The options are from A to J, each pointing to a different constitutional issue. I need to determine which one is the applicable rule here.

First, I should recall the relevant constitutional principles. The question seems to touch on several amendments, like the First, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth, and concepts like bills of attainder, equal protection, and due process.

The key issue here is whether the statute is constitutional. The statute is making it a crime for a communist to hold a union office. That sounds like it's imposing a penalty based on someone's political affiliation or beliefs.

I remember that the Constitution prohibits bills of attainder, which are laws that single out individuals or groups for punishment without a trial. The idea is that the legislature can't act as the judiciary by pronouncing guilt and punishment. So if the statute is punishing people simply for being communists, it might be a bill of attainder.

Wait, but I think the Supreme Court has dealt with similar cases. There's the case of United States v. Lovett, where the Court struck down a law that prohibited certain federal employees from receiving salaries because they were deemed subversive. The Court said it was a bill of attainder because it imposed punishment without a judicial trial.

Another case that comes to mind is the Communist Control Act cases, where laws targeting communists were challenged. The Court has generally held that laws which impose penalties on individuals based on their political beliefs without a trial violate the Constitution, specifically as bills of attainder.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the provision is a form of legislative punishment, which is a bill of attainder. That fits with what I was thinking.

Option J says it's unconstitutional because it infringes on the right to political affiliation under the First Amendment. That's also a possible angle because the First Amendment protects association and political beliefs.

So now I'm torn between C and J. I need to think about the difference between a bill of attainder and a First Amendment violation.

A bill of attainder is a legislative act that singles out a person or group for punishment without trial. It's more about the process of punishment without due process, rather than the content of the regulation.

On the other hand, the First Amendment issue would be about the government restricting someone's right to associate or hold certain political beliefs, which is a substantive due process or equal protection issue.

In the case described, the statute is making it a crime for a communist to hold office. So it's both imposing a penalty (punishment) and restricting their employment based on their political affiliation.

I think the key here is whether the statute is considered punitive. If it's a penalty without a trial, it's a bill of attainder. Alternatively, if it's a regulation based on their status, it's a First Amendment issue.

Wait, another point: The Supreme Court case of De Jonge v. Oregon might be relevant. It held that the First Amendment protects the right to associate for political purposes. But in this case, the statute is preventing someone from holding a position because of their party membership.

But the question is about the constitutional rule applicable to the statute. So the statute making it a crime is a form of punishment. Therefore, it's more aligned with a bill of attainder because it's legislative punishment without trial.

So option C says it's a bill of attainder. Option J says it's a First Amendment violation regarding political affiliation.

I think the correct answer is C because it's about legislative punishment without trial, which is a bill of attainder. The First Amendment issue would more likely involve prior restraints or content-based restrictions, but the core issue here is the method of punishment by Congress without judicial process.

Another angle: The Fifth Amendment's due process clause also protects against deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process. If the statute is taking away someone's job (liberty/property) without a trial, that's a due process violation. But option G says it's a violation of Fifth Amendment due process. So that's another possibility.

Wait, but in the case of United States v. Lovett, the Court found it was a bill of attainder, which is an issue under Article I, Section 10 (states can't pass bills of attainder) and Article I, Section 9 (federal government can't pass them either). So it's a separation of powers issue, where Congress is acting judicially.

So, the statute is a bill of attainder because it's imposing punishment without trial. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

But wait, option J is about the First Amendment right to political affiliation. The Supreme Court has held that the government can't impose penalties solely based on someone's beliefs or associations unless there's a clear and present danger. But in this case, the statute is making it a crime, which is a penalty, so it's both a bill of attainder and a First Amendment issue.

Hmm, but the question is about the most applicable rule. Bills of attainder are specific and directly address legislative punishment, whereas the First Amendment would be a broader application.

I think the primary issue here is the bill of attainder because it's about Congress acting as a judicial body to punish without trial. So the correct answer is C.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of a statutory provision that makes it a crime for a member of the communist party to act as an official of a labor union. The key issue is whether this provision violates the Constitution, and if so, under which constitutional principle.

The statute imposes a penalty on individuals based solely on their political affiliation without a trial, which raises concerns about legislative overreach. This scenario aligns with the constitutional prohibition against bills of attainder, as established in cases like *United States v. Lovett*. Bills of attainder are legislative acts that single out individuals or groups for punishment without judicial process, violating the separation of powers and the right to due process.

While the First Amendment protects political affiliation and association, the primary issue here is the legislative imposition of punishment without trial, making the bill of attainder doctrine the most applicable rule. Therefore, the statutory provision is unconstitutional because it constitutes a bill of attainder.
