Okay, so I've got this physics question about projectile motion. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about which statement is true concerning the motion of an ideal projectile launched at a 45-degree angle to the horizontal.

First, I remember that in projectile motion, when you launch something at an angle, it has both horizontal and vertical components of velocity. The key point is that the horizontal component doesn't change if we neglect air resistance because there's no acceleration in the horizontal direction. But the vertical component is affected by gravity.

So, the projectile's motion can be broken down into horizontal and vertical parts. The horizontal velocity (v_x) is constant, while the vertical velocity (v_y) changes because of gravity. The acceleration in the vertical direction is g (9.8 m/s² downward), so the vertical velocity decreases as it goes up and increases as it comes down.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: The horizontal speed decreases on the way up and increases on the way down. Wait, no, the horizontal speed should stay constant because there's no air resistance. So A must be incorrect.

Option B: The acceleration vector points opposite to the velocity on the way up and same on the way down. Hmm. The acceleration is always downward because gravity acts down. So when the projectile is going up, the velocity is upwards, so acceleration is opposite (down). When coming down, the velocity is down, so acceleration is same direction. So B says that on the way up, acceleration is opposite, and on way down same. That's correct. So B might be true. But wait, let me check other options.

Option C: The total speed increases during the entire flight. That doesn't sound right. At launch, the speed is maximum because both components are high. As it goes up, vertical speed decreases, so total speed decreases. At the top, speed is lower (only horizontal component). Then, as it starts to come down, vertical speed increases again, but since horizontal is constant, the total speed increases. So the total speed decreases until the peak, then increases. So the total speed isn't increasing the entire flight. So C is false.

Option D: Speed at top is maximum. No, because at the top, vertical component is zero, so speed is just the horizontal component, which is lower than the initial speed (which had both components). So D is wrong.

Option E: Vertical speed increases up and decreases down. No, because as it goes up, vertical speed decreases (slowing down), and as it comes down, it increases. So E is the opposite, so E is wrong.

Option F: Total speed decreases during entire flight. No, because after the peak, it starts increasing again. So F is wrong.

Option G: Vertical speed decreases on way up and increases on way down. Yes, that makes sense. Because gravity is slowing it down as it ascends and speeding it up as it descends. So G is correct. But let me check.

Option H: Acceleration same as velocity on way up and opposite when down. No, because acceleration is always down. So when going up, acceleration is opposite; when going down, same. So H says the opposite of that. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Speed at top is zero. No, horizontal speed is still present. So I is wrong.

Option J: Total speed remains constant. No, because as we discussed, it first decreases then increases. So J is wrong.

So, the correct options so far seem to be B and G. Wait, let me reevaluate. 

Option B says the acceleration points opposite to velocity on way up and same on way down. That's correct because on the way up, velocity is upward, acceleration is down (opposite). On the way down, velocity is downward, acceleration is down (same direction). So B is correct.

Option G says vertical speed decreases on way up and increases on way down. Yes, that's correct. Because when you throw something upwards, its upward velocity decreases until it stops (at peak), then increases in the downward direction as it falls.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is true. So both B and G are correct? But the options are mutually exclusive because it's a multiple-choice question with only one correct answer. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, the options are A to J. So I need to pick the correct one.

I think that B and G are both correct statements. But let me look again.

Wait, the question is about which statement is true. So let me think about each option's validity.

Option B: Acceleration vector direction. Yes, on the way up, acceleration (down) is opposite to velocity (up). On the way down, acceleration (down) is same as velocity (down). So B is correct.

Option G: Vertical speed decreases on the way up and increases on way down. That's correct because as projectile goes up, v_y decreases; as it comes down, v_y increases in the negative direction. So G is correct.

Wait, but can both B and G be correct? Because each is making a different correct point. The question is which statement is true, so perhaps more than one is correct, but the options are such that only one is correct.

Wait, looking back, the question states "Which one of the following statements is true"—so only one option is correct.

So which of B and G is correct?

Let me re-examine each.

Option B says the acceleration vector points opposite to the velocity vector on the way up and same direction on the way down. Since acceleration is always downward, that's correct. So B is correct.

Option G says vertical speed decreases on the way up and increases on the way down. Yes, correct because as it goes up, v_y decreases (becomes less positive); as it comes down, v_y becomes more negative (so its magnitude increases). So G is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which option is correct. So both B and G are correct?

But the options are given as A to J, and each is a separate option. So I must have made a mistake in my initial assessment.

Wait no, because in projectile motion, the vertical velocity changes. So G is correct.

But looking back, which options are present.

Wait, the options are:

A: Incorrect because horizontal speed is constant.

B: Correct.

G: Also correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to reevaluate. Because the question could have only one correct answer, I must determine which is the correct statement.

Wait, perhaps B is incorrect. Let me think again.

No, B is correct because when the projectile is moving upward, the velocity vector is up, and acceleration is down, so they're opposite. When moving downward, velocity is down, and acceleration is down, same direction. So B is correct.

G is correct because as the projectile moves up, vertical speed decreases; as it comes down, it increases. So G is correct.

Wait, but that would mean both B and G are correct, but that can't be because it's a single-choice question. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the speed, not the velocity components. Let's see the options again.

The question is about which statement is true.

Wait, option J says the object's total speed remains constant. That's not correct because the total speed is sqrt(vx² + vy²). Since vy changes, the total speed changes. So J is incorrect.

Option C says total speed increases during entire flight. That's wrong because it first decreases, then increases. So C is wrong.

Option G says vertical speed decreases on the way up and increases on the way down. That's correct.

Wait, but then option G must be correct. But what about B?

Let me think about the acceleration vector. Since acceleration is constant (g downward), it's correct that on the way up, acceleration is opposite to velocity, and same on the way down. So B is correct.

Wait, but the options might not have both B and G correct. So perhaps only one is correct, and I'm missing something.

Wait the options are:

Option B: The acceleration vector points opposite to the velocity vector on the way up and in the same direction as the velocity vector on the way down.

Yes, that's correct.

Option G: The vertical speed decreases on the way up and increases on the way down.

Yes, that's correct.

But since the question is multiple-choice with only one correct answer, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, looking at the options again. Let me re-express each.

Option B: Accel opposite to velocity on way up, same on way down. Correct.

Option G: Vertical speed decreases going up, increases going down. Correct.

So both B and G are correct statements about the motion. But that's impossible because the options are single-answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm misremembering. Oh wait, wait. The initial velocity is 45 degrees, so the horizontal and vertical components are equal. But that doesn't affect the generality of the statements in B and G.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the 'same direction on the way down'. Wait, no. When the projectile is going down, velocity is in the same direction as acceleration (both downward). So B is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is both B and G, but I must choose between them. But the options don't have them both; in the given options, they are separate.

Looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in another way. Let me check the options again:

The options are:

A: Horizontal speed decreases up, increases down. No.

B: Accel opposite way up, same down. Yes.

C: Total speed increases entire flight. No.

D: Speed at top is max. No.

E: Vertical speed increases up, decreases down. No.

F: Speed decreases entire flight. No.

G: Vertical speed decreases up, increases down. Yes.

H: Accel same up, opposite down. No.

I: Speed at top zero. No.

J: Speed same. No.

So both B and G are correct. But that can't be. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The question is about which statement is true. So let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the vertical speed increases in magnitude on the way down. So G is correct.

But B is also correct. So perhaps the correct answer is both B and G, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in reality, when the projectile is moving upwards, the vertical velocity decreases (so G is correct), and the acceleration is opposite to the direction of motion (so B is correct). So both are correct.

But that's a problem because the options can't have two correct answers. I must have made an error in my reasoning.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The question is which statement is true. So perhaps I should pick both, but since that's not possible, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing speed and velocity in option G. Option G says vertical speed increases on the way down, which is correct because the magnitude of vertical velocity increases as it comes down. So G is correct.

Option B is correct because the direction of acceleration is opposite to velocity on the way up, same on the way down.

So both B and G are correct. But that's impossible because the options are single-answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick, and actually, option J is correct. Wait, no. Because the total speed isn't constant. Because at the peak, the speed is lower than the initial speed. So J is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about the total speed. Let me compute it.

The initial speed is v₀ at 45 degrees. So v₀x = v₀y = (v₀)/√2. The total initial speed is v₀.

At the highest point, v_y is zero, so speed is v₀x = v₀/√2, which is about 0.707 v₀. Then, as the projectile comes down, the vertical component becomes v_y = gt (but since it's a projectile, the time up is (v₀y)/g = (v₀/√2)/g. So the time to come down is the same. But that's getting too detailed.

Wait, the speed at the top is v₀x, which is less than v₀. Then, as it comes down, the vertical speed increases downward, so the total speed increases again. So the total speed first decreases, then increases. So it's not constant, nor always increasing or decreasing.

So in the flight, the speed is maximum at launch and landing, and lower at the top.

So which options are correct?

So the statements:

Option B: Correct.

Option G: Correct.

But according to the given options, only one can be correct. So I must have made a mistake in my initial assessment.

Wait, perhaps B is correct and G is incorrect. Or vice versa.

Wait, option G says the vertical speed increases on the way down. That's correct because as it comes down, the vertical component becomes more negative, so its magnitude increases.

Option B says the acceleration vector points opposite to velocity on the way up and same direction on the way down. That's correct because acceleration is gravity, which is down.

So both B and G are correct statements.

But that can't be because the options are unique. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question is about the speed, not the components.

Wait, the problem is an ideal projectile, so no air resistance. So the horizontal speed is constant. So option A is wrong.

So, going back, perhaps the correct answer is option G. But another thought: the vertical speed on the way up decreases, which is correct, and on the way down it increases. So G is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is true. So perhaps both B and G are correct, but that's not possible. I need to see which of these is among the options.

Wait, the options are given as A to J, and the correct answer must be one of them.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option B.

Wait, option B says the acceleration vector points opposite to the velocity vector on the way up and in the same direction as the velocity vector on the way down.

Yes, that's correct because when going up, velocity is up, acceleration is down. When going down, velocity is down, acceleration is down. So B is correct.

Hmm. So the conclusion is that both B and G are correct statements, but the options don't allow that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps only one of them is correct. Let me think about the options again.

Wait, the question is about the motion of an ideal projectile. So, in reality, not considering air resistance, the horizontal speed is constant, and the vertical speed changes.

Looking again at the options:

The correct statements would be:

- Horizontal speed is constant (so A is wrong, as it says it decreases and increases).

- Vertical speed decreases going up, increases going down (so G is correct).

- Acceleration is always downward (so B is correct).

But since the problem asks for which one is true, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps option G is correct and B is incorrect. Wait, no. Because B is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is G because it's talking about the vertical speed, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B because it's correct about the acceleration.

Wait, perhaps I should go with option G as the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Another approach: think about each option and determine which is correct.

Option B: The acceleration vector points opposite to the velocity vector on the way up and in the same direction as the velocity vector on the way down.

Yes, because acceleration is gravity, which is down. When the projectile is moving upward, velocity is up, so acceleration is opposite. When moving down, velocity is down, so acceleration is same direction. So B is correct.

Option G: The vertical speed decreases on the way up and increases on the way down.

Yes, because as you go up, the vertical component decreases (becomes less positive), and as you come down, it becomes more negative, so the magnitude increases. So G is correct.

Wait, but the options can't have both B and G correct. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in reality, when the projectile is moving upwards, the vertical velocity decreases, and when it's moving downwards, the vertical velocity becomes more negative, so the magnitude increases. So G is correct.

So perhaps the correct answer is G.

But earlier, B also seemed correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that in the problem statement, it's the acceleration vector relative to the velocity vector.

Wait, option B says the acceleration vector points opposite to velocity on the way up and same on the way down. That must be correct because acceleration is always down.

So perhaps the correct answer is B and G. But since that's not possible, perhaps the intended answer is G.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me check the possible answers again.

Another approach: remember that in projectile motion, the only acceleration is downward (gravity), so the direction of acceleration is always the same, regardless of the direction of motion. Hence, when the projectile is moving up, acceleration is opposite; when moving down, same direction.

So option B is correct.

Option G is also correct because the vertical component decreases as it goes up and increases as it comes down.

Wait, but perhaps the question is about the speed, not the velocity vector. So in terms of speed (scalar), the vertical speed decreases on the way up, and increases on the way down. So G is correct.

But according to the options, both B and G are correct. But since the question is multiple-choice, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look for the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J: the object's total speed remains constant. No, because the speed changes as the vertical component changes. So J is wrong.

So I'm back to B and G.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G because it's about the vertical speed, which changes.

But I'm not sure anymore. I think I'll have to go with option G because it directly addresses the change in vertical speed, which is a key aspect of projectile motion.

In projectile motion, the horizontal velocity remains constant (assuming no air resistance), while the vertical velocity changes due to gravity. The acceleration is always downward (opposite to the upward direction) and is caused by gravity. Let us analyze the given options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The horizontal speed remains constant throughout the motion; it does not decrease on the way up or increase on the way down.  
- **Option B**: Correct. The acceleration vector (always downward due to gravity) points opposite to the velocity vector on the way up (when the velocity is upward) and in the same direction as the velocity vector on the way down (when the velocity is downward).  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The total speed does not increase during the entire flight. At the top of the trajectory, the vertical component of velocity is zero, so the total speed decreases until the peak and then increases as the projectile descends.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The speed at the top
