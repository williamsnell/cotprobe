The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The Opposition tells us that we ought not to govern a people without their consent. I answer, the rule of liberty that all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed, applies only to those who are capable of self-government. We govern the Indians without their consent, we govern our territories without their consent, we govern our children without their consent. How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them? And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world? Shall we turn these peoples back to the reeking hands from which we have taken them? Shall we abandon them, with Germany, England, Japan, hungering for them? Shall we save them from those nations, to give them a self-rule of tragedy?â€¦Then, like men and not like children, let us on to our tasks, our mission, and our destiny."
Albert J. Beveridge, "The March of the Flag," 1898
Which of the following rationales does Beveridge employ in his argument?

Options:

A: Governing territories confers economic benefits to both European and nonwhite nations.
B: The United States is obligated to expand its territory for the sake of national security.
C: The closing of the western frontier impels the United States to expand its territory overseas.
D: Powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed nations.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a speech by Albert J. Beveridge from 1898. I'm a bit rusty on my American history, but I'll try to break this down.

The question is asking which rationale Beveridge uses in his argument. The options are A through D, each presenting a different reasoning.

First, I'll read the provided text carefully. Beveridge is talking about governing people without their consent. He compares it to governing Indians, territories, and children, implying that some groups aren't capable of self-governance. He argues that the U.S. provides a better government than what the Philippines had before, which he describes as "savage" and "bloody." He also mentions other countries like Germany, England, and Japan wanting to take over, suggesting that the U.S. should prevent that.

So, the main points I'm picking up are:
1. The idea that some people aren't ready for self-government and need guidance.
2. The U.S. has a mission to civilize and bring order.
3. There's a moral duty to protect these people from other nations and from their own potential chaos.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Economic benefits for both European and nonwhite nations. The text doesn't really talk about economic benefits. It's more about governance and moral duty, so I don't think this is it.

Option B: National security through expansion. The speech mentions other countries wanting to take over, which could relate to security, but the main argument seems more about the moral duty to help rather than security. So maybe, but not sure yet.

Option C: Closing of the western frontier pushing overseas expansion. I don't recall Beveridge mentioning the frontier in this text. The frontier closing was more of a Turner thesis idea, but I don't see that here. So probably not.

Option D: Powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed ones. This sounds spot on. Beveridge is saying that the U.S. has a mission to civilize and rescue the Philippines from worse situations, implying a moral obligation.

Wait, let me double-check. He says the U.S. is providing a "just, human, civilizing government" and asks if they should abandon them to other nations or let them have self-rule that would be tragic. That definitely points to a moral duty to govern those he sees as less capable.

So the answer is D.

The correct answer is D. Beveridge's argument centers on the idea that powerful nations have a moral duty to govern less developed ones, emphasizing the U.S.'s mission to civilize and protect.

Answer: D
