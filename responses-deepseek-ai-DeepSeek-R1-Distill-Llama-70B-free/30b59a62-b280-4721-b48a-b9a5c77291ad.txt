Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the frequency of a helium-neon laser. Hmm, I remember that lasers emit light at specific wavelengths. The problem says the wavelength is 632.8 nm. I need to find the frequency. 

Wait, I think I should use the formula that relates speed of light, wavelength, and frequency. Oh right, c equals lambda times nu. So c = λ * ν. That makes sense because the speed of light is the product of the wavelength and the frequency of the light wave.

So I need to solve for ν, the frequency. Rearranging the formula, ν should be equal to c divided by λ. Got it. 

What's the speed of light in a vacuum? I remember it's approximately 3.00 x 10^8 meters per second. But wait, the wavelength given is in nanometers. Oh right, I should convert that to meters to keep the units consistent. 

So 632.8 nm is the same as 632.8 x 10^-9 meters. Because 1 nm is 1e-9 meters. Let me write that down: λ = 632.8e-9 m.

Now plug in the numbers into the formula. ν = c / λ. Substituting the numbers, ν = (3.00e8 m/s) / (632.8e-9 m).

Let me do the division. Let's see, 3e8 divided by 632.8e-9. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this. Let's write the denominator as 6.328e-7. So 3e8 divided by 6.328e-7.

Wait, 3e8 is 3 x 10^8, and 6.328e-7 is 6.328 x 10^-7. So when you divide, the exponents subtract: 10^8 / 10^-7 = 10^(8+7) = 10^15. So the calculation becomes (3 / 6.328) x 10^15.

Wait, actually, let me think again. 3e8 divided by 6.328e-7 is (3 / 6.328) multiplied by 10^(8 - (-7)) which is 10^15? Wait wait, 8 - (-7) is 15, yes. So the exponent is 15.

So 3 divided by 6.328. Let me approximate that. Let's see, 6.328 times 0.47 is approximately. Hmm, 6.328 * 0.47: 6*0.47 is 2.82, 0.328*0.47 is about 0.154, so total is around 2.974. That's close to 3. So 3 / 6.328 is roughly 0.474, maybe a little less because 6.328*0.474 is?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 3 divided by 6.328 more accurately. Let me do this division. 3 ÷ 6.328. Let's see, 6.328 goes into 3 zero times. So 0., and then we have 30.000... Let me compute this as a decimal.

6.328 into 30.000. 6 times 4 is 24, 6.328 is about 6.33. 6.33 * 4 = 25.32, which is less than 30. So 4 times. 4 * 6.328 is 25.312. Subtract that from 30, gives 4.688. Bring down a zero, making 46.88.

6.328 goes into 46.88 how many times? Let's see, 6.328 *7=44.296. 6.328*7=44.296. Subtract that from 46.88, we get 2.584. Bring down a zero, making 25.84.

6.328 into 25.84? Let's see, 6.328*4=25.312. So 4 times. 25.312 subtracted from 25.84 gives 0.528. Bring down a zero, making 5.28.

6.328 goes into 5.28 less than once. So 0. So far, we have 0.474... So the division is approximately 0.474.

So ν≈0.474 x 10^15 Hz. Wait, 0.474e15 Hz is the same as 4.74e14 Hz.

Looking at the options, option I is 4.738e14 Hz. That's really close to what I got. So I think the correct answer is I.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to mix up exponents.

Let me recalculate the division step more carefully. 3e8 m/s divided by 632.8e-9 m.

632.8e-9 m is the same as 6.328e-7 m. So 3e8 / 6.328e-7 = (3 / 6.328) * 10^(8 - (-7)) )? Wait, no. Wait, 3e8 is 3 x 10^8, and 6.328e-7 is 6.328 x 10^-7. So when you divide, the exponents subtract: 10^8 / 10^-7 = 10^(8+7) = 10^15.

So the calculation is (3 / 6.328) x 10^15. I think I did that right before.

3 / 6.328 ≈ 0.474. So 0.474 x 1e15 = 4.74e14 Hz.

Looking at the options, option I is 4.738e14 Hz. That's very close, so I must have miscalculated a bit in the division, but it's the closest option.

So the answer should be I.

To calculate the frequency of the helium-neon laser, we use the relationship between the speed of light \( c \), wavelength \( \lambda \), and frequency \( \nu \):  

\[
c = \lambda \nu \quad \text{or} \quad \nu = \frac{c}{\lambda}.
\]

### Step 1: Convert the wavelength to meters  
The wavelength is given as \( \lambda = 632.8 \, \text{nm} \). Since \( 1 \, \text{nm} = 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \), we have:  

\[
\lambda = 632.8 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 6.328 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Substitute known values  
The speed of light in a vacuum is \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting into the formula:  

\[
\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda} = \frac{3.00 \times 10^8}{6.328 \times 10^{-7}}.
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the calculation  
Divide the coefficients and subtract the exponents:  

\[
\nu = \frac{3.00}{6.328} \times 10^{8 - (-7)} = \frac{3.00}{6.328} \times 10^{15}.
\]

Performing the division \( \frac{3.00}{6.328} \), we find:  

\[
\frac{3.00}{6.328} \approx 0.474.
\]

Thus:  

\[
\nu \approx 0.474 \times 10^{15} \, \text{Hz} = 4.74 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Hz}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option  
The closest option to \( 4.74 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Hz} \) is **I: \( 4.738 \times 10^{14} \, \text{Hz} \)**.
