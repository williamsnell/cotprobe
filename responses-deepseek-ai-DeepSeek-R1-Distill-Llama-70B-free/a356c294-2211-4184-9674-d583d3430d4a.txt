Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about determining the rate law for a reaction. Hmm, I remember that the rate law is found by looking at how the concentrations of the reactants affect the rate of the reaction. The reaction given is A + 2B → products. The data from three experiments is provided, so I need to analyze that.

Let me look at the experiments. There are three experiments, each with different concentrations of A and B, and the corresponding rate. My goal is to find the order of the reaction with respect to each reactant.

I think the way to approach this is to compare experiments where only one concentration changes at a time. That way, I can determine how each concentration affects the rate.

Looking at Experiments 1 and 2: 

In Experiment 1, [A] is 2.0e-3, [B] is 4.0e-3, and the rate is 5.7e-7.
In Experiment 2, [A] is the same (2.0e-3), but [B] is doubled to 8.0e-3. The rate here is 11.4e-7.

So when [B] doubles, the rate also doubles (5.7e-7 * 2 = ~11.4e-7). That suggests that the rate is directly proportional to [B], so the order with respect to B is 1. Because if [B] increases by a factor and the rate increases by the same factor, the order is 1.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should calculate the ratio. Let me see: [B]2/[B]1 = 8e-3 /4e-3 = 2. The rate2/rate1 is (11.4e-7)/(5.7e-7) = 2. So rate is proportional to [B]^1. So B is first order.

Now, looking at Experiments 1 and 3. [A] in Experiment 3 is 4.0e-3, which is double that of Experiment 1 (2.0e-3). [B] is the same (4.0e-3). The rate in Experiment 3 is 22.8e-7, which is four times the rate of Experiment 1 (5.7e-7 *4 = 22.8e-7).

So when [A] doubles, the rate quadruples. That suggests that the rate is proportional to [A]^2. Because (2)^2 =4. So the order with respect to A is 2.

So putting it together, the rate law should be rate = k [A]^2 [B]^1. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options: 

Option J is rate = k [A]^2 [B]. So that fits.

Wait, but wait, let me recheck my calculations.

In Experiment 1 and 2: [A] same, [B] doubles, rate doubles. So order of B is 1.

In Experiment 1 and 3: [A] doubles, [B] same, rate goes from 5.7 to 22.8, which is 4 times. So 2^2 =4, so order of A is 2.

Yes, that's correct. So the rate law is rate = k [A]^2 [B].

Looking at the options, that's option J.

To determine the rate law for the reaction \( A + 2B \rightarrow \text{products} \), we analyze the provided experimental data:

### Step 1: Determine the order with respect to \( [B] \)
- Compare **Experiment 1** and **Experiment 2**:
  - \( [A] \) is constant at \( 2.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mol/L} \).
  - \( [B] \) doubles from \( 4.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mol/L} \) to \( 8.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mol/L} \).
  - The rate also doubles from \( 5.7 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{mol/L·s} \) to \( 11.4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{mol/L·s} \).
  - This indicates that the rate is directly proportional to \( [B] \), so the order with respect to \( B \) is 1.

### Step 2: Determine the order with respect to \( [A] \)
- Compare **Experiment 1** and **Experiment 3**:
  - \( [B] \) is constant at \( 4.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mol/L} \).
  - \( [A] \) doubles from \( 2.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mol/L} \) to \( 4.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mol/L} \).
  - The rate increases by a factor of 4, from \( 5.7 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{mol/L·s} \) to \( 22.8 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{mol/L·s} \).
  - This indicates that the rate is proportional to \( [A]^2 \), so the order with respect to \( A \) is 2.

### Step 3: Write the rate law
From the above analysis, the rate law is:
\[
\text{Rate} = k [A]^2 [B]
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The correct option is **J: rate = k [A]^2 [B]**.
