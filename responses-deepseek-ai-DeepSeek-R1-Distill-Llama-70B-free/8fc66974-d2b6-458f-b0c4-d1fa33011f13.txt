Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these energy conservation questions. Let's see what the question says.

So the setup is a horizontal massless spring attached to a wall. On the other end, there's a mass of 0.30 kg resting on a table. The mass is displaced by 0.030 meters from its equilibrium position and then released. As it passes through the equilibrium point, its speed is 0.040 m/s. The question is asking for the total mechanical energy of the system when there's no friction. 

Hmm, right. I remember that in the absence of friction, the mechanical energy should be conserved. That means the total energy at any point in the motion should be the same as at any other point. So the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energies.

Wait, but when the mass is at equilibrium, what's happening? At equilibrium, the displacement is zero, so the potential energy from the spring should be zero as well. But the kinetic energy would be at its maximum because the mass is moving fastest there. Oh wait, but no, that's when it's passing through equilibrium. So the potential energy is zero and kinetic is maximum. So the total energy would just be the kinetic energy at that point, right?

Wait, no. Because the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But since potential is zero at equilibrium, the total energy must equal the kinetic energy there. But wait, the problem gives the speed at that point, so we can calculate the kinetic energy right there.

Alternatively, another approach: the total mechanical energy is also equal to the potential energy when the mass is at its maximum displacement because at that point, the mass isn't moving (so kinetic energy is zero) and all energy is stored as potential in the spring.

So the total energy E should be equal to both the maximum potential energy and the maximum kinetic energy at equilibrium.

Let me try both approaches to check.

First approach: At equilibrium, potential energy U = 0 (since displacement x is zero), so E = K. So E is just the kinetic energy at that point.

Kinetic energy K is (1/2)mv². So m is 0.30 kg, v is 0.040 m/s.

Plugging in the numbers: 0.5 * 0.3 * (0.04)^2.

Let me compute that. 0.5 * 0.3 is 0.15. 0.04 squared is 0.0016. Multiply 0.15 * 0.0016.

0.15 * 0.0016 = 0.00024. Since the unit is joules, that's 0.24 millijoules. Oh wait, let me think about the units again. 0.3 kg, 0.04 m/s. So K is (0.3)(0.04)^2 * 0.5.

Wait, 0.04 squared is 0.0016. 0.3 * 0.0016 is 0.00048. Then multiply by 0.5: 0.00024 J, which is 0.24 mJ. So that would be the total mechanical energy.

Alternatively, let's think about when the mass is at maximum displacement. At that point, it's not moving, so all energy is potential. So U is (1/2)kx². But wait, I don't know the spring constant k. Hmm, because the problem doesn't give it directly. But perhaps I can find k using the information given.

Wait, another approach: since energy is conserved, the sum of kinetic and potential at any point equals E. So when the mass is released from the maximum displacement, it has potential energy U = (1/2)kx², and K=0. So E = (1/2)k x². But then, when it passes through equilibrium, U=0, and K is (1/2)mv². So E must equal both.

So (1/2)k x² = (1/2) m v². So k can be found from this equation. Let me compute k.

k = (m v²) / x².

Wait, let's plug in the numbers.

m = 0.30 kg, v = 0.040 m/s, x = 0.030 m.

So v squared is 0.0016, m is 0.3. 0.3 * 0.0016 = 0.00048. x squared is (0.03)^2 = 0.0009.

So k = 0.00048 / 0.0009 = 0.5333... N/m. Approximately 0.533 N/m.

But wait, once I have k, I can compute E as (1/2)k x². Let's see:

(1/2) * (0.5333) * (0.03)^2.

0.03 squared is 0.0009. 0.5333 * 0.0009 is 0.00048. Multiply by 0.5: 0.00024 J, which is again 0.24 mJ. So that's the same result as before.

So the total mechanical energy is 0.24 mJ. Looking back at the options, option C is 0.24 mJ.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because the mass is on a table, so is there any gravitational potential energy involved? Oh, the problem says it's a horizontal spring, so the mass doesn't change its vertical position. Therefore, the gravitational potential energy is constant and can be ignored, or included but since it's the same at all points, it's part of the total mechanical energy, which in this case is just the energy of the spring-mass system. So the total mechanical energy would be the sum of the spring's potential and the kinetic energy, but since the gravitational part doesn't change, we can ignore it when calculating the change. So the problem is only considering the spring's potential and the kinetic energy, and any other forms are either zero or constant.

So the answer should be 0.24 mJ, which is option C.

To determine the total mechanical energy of the system, we note that in the absence of friction, mechanical energy is conserved. The total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic energy (K) and potential energy (U). For a horizontal spring-mass system, the gravitational potential energy is constant and can be ignored since the mass does not move vertically.

### Approach 1: At Equilibrium
At the equilibrium position, the displacement \( x = 0 \), so the potential energy of the spring is \( U = 0 \). All the energy is in the form of kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is given by:

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

Here, \( m = 0.30 \, \text{kg} \) and \( v = 0.040 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting the values:

\[
K = \frac{1}{2} (0.30) (0.040)^2 = 0.15 \cdot 0.0016 = 0.00024 \, \text{J} = 0.24 \, \text{mJ}
\]

Thus, the total mechanical energy of the system is \( E = K = 0.24 \, \text{mJ} \).

### Approach 2: At Maximum Displacement
At maximum displacement (\( x = 0.030 \, \text{m} \)), the mass is momentarily at rest, so \( K = 0 \) and all energy is stored as potential energy in the spring. The potential energy is given by:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
\]

To find \( k \), we use the fact that at equilibrium, the total energy is conserved:

\[
\frac{1}{2} k x^2 = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

Solving for \( k \):

\[
k = \frac{m v^2}{x^2}
\]

Substituting \( m = 0.30 \, \text{kg} \), \( v = 0.040 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( x = 0.030 \, \text{m} \):

\[
k = \frac{(0.30)(0.040)^2}{(0.030)^2} = \frac{0.00048}{0.0009} = 0.533 \, \text{N/m}
\]

Now, calculate \( U \) at maximum displacement:

\[
U = \frac{1}{2} (0.533) (0.030)^2 = 0.5 \cdot 0.533 \cdot 0.0009 = 0.00024 \, \text{J} = 0.24 \, \text{mJ}
\]

Thus, the total mechanical energy is \( E = U = 0.24 \, \text{mJ} \).

### Final Answer
Both approaches confirm that the total mechanical energy of the system is \( 0.24 \, \text{mJ} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: 0.24 mJ**
