C: 12 + 2.326(0.3) ounces
D: 12 - 1.96(0.3) ounces
E: 12 + 2.576(0.3) ounces
F: 12 + 1.645(0.3) ounces
G: 12 - 0.99(0.3) ounces
H: 12 - 2.576(0.3) ounces
I: 12 + 1.96(0.3) ounces

Okay, so I have this problem about a soft drink dispenser, and I need to figure out the correct mean setting so that a 12-ounce cup overflows less than 1% of the time. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I remember that the dispenser's delivery follows a normal distribution. The standard deviation is given as 0.3 ounces. The problem is about setting the mean so that the probability of overflowing is less than 1%. Overflowing would mean that the amount dispensed is more than 12 ounces, right?

Wait, no, wait. The cup is 12 ounces. So if the dispenser delivers more than 12, the cup overflows. So we need to find the mean (μ) such that the probability of delivering more than 12 ounces is less than 1%. 

I think in terms of the normal distribution, the Z-score tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean a value is. The Z formula is Z = (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.

We need to find μ such that P(X > 12) < 0.01 (since 1% is 0.01). Because the normal distribution is symmetric, the area to the right of 12 should be less than 1%.

Wait, wait, but in a standard normal distribution table, we usually look for the Z value that corresponds to a certain area. Since 1% is in the upper tail, the Z value would be the one that leaves 1% in the upper tail. I think that's the 99th percentile. Let me think. Wait, actually, no, the 99th percentile would correspond to 99% of the data below it, so the Z-score for 0.99 cumulative probability is about 2.33. But wait, this is for a two-tailed scenario?

Wait, no, the 1% is the area in one tail. So if the total area in the upper tail beyond Z is 1%, that's the Z value we need. Looking at the standard normal table, the Z that corresponds to 0.99 (since 1 - 0.01 = 0.99) is approximately 2.326. Yeah, I remember that Z for 99% confidence is around 2.326.

So the equation would be: P(X > 12) = 0.01. So, rearranging, 12 is the point where only 1% of the distribution lies beyond it. Using the Z formula, we can write:

Z = (12 - μ) / σ = 2.326

Wait, no. Because when X is greater than 12, and we're solving for μ, I need to think about how to set this up. Let me think again. The Z-score for X=12 is (12 - μ)/σ. Since we want the area beyond 12 to be 1%, the Z-score should be positive 2.326. So:

(12 - μ) / σ = 2.326

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If the mean is set lower, then 12 would be to the right of the mean. So for the probability that X is greater than 12 to be 1%, the Z-score is 2.326. So:

(12 - μ) / σ = 2.326.

Because if μ is less than 12, then 12 is higher than the mean, so the Z would be positive.

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. The Z-score for X being at 12 is (12 - μ)/σ. If we want P(X > 12) = 0.01, then 12 is at the 99th percentile. So the Z value is 2.326. So:

(12 - μ) / 0.3 = 2.326

So solving for μ:

12 - μ = 2.326 * 0.3

Then μ = 12 - (2.326 * 0.3)

Let me compute that. 2.326 * 0.3 is approximately 0.6978. So μ ≈ 12 - 0.6978 = 11.3022 ounces.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this. Let me check each option:

Option B: 12 - 1.645(0.3). 1.645 is the Z for 90% confidence (5% tail), not 1% tail.

Option D: 12 -1.96(0.3). 1.96 is the Z for 95% confidence (2.5% tail each side). So probably not.

Option H: 12 - 2.576(0.3). 2.576 is the Z for 99.5% confidence, which is 0.5% tail. So that would be for 0.5% overflow, but we need 1%.

Option J: 12 - 2.326(0.3). Because 2.326 is the Z for 99% (1% tail). So that's exactly what we're looking for.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. So the formula I used was (12 - μ)/σ = Z, so solving for μ gives μ = 12 - Z*σ. That makes sense because if the machine's mean is set lower, then 12 is higher, giving a higher chance to overflow. But we want the overflow to be less than 1% of the time, so we set the mean such that 12 is 2.326 standard deviations above the mean.

So the correct formula is μ = 12 - (Z * σ), where Z is 2.326. So looking at the options, option J is 12 - 2.326*(0.3), which is exactly that.

So the answer should be option J.

To determine the correct mean setting for the soft drink dispenser so that a 12-ounce cup overflows less than 1% of the time, we use the normal distribution. The standard deviation is given as 0.3 ounces, and the goal is to ensure that the probability of delivering more than 12 ounces is less than 1% (P(X > 12) < 0.01).

In a normal distribution, the Z-score corresponding to a 1% upper tail probability is approximately 2.326. The Z-score formula is:

\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

Here, \(X = 12\), \(\sigma = 0.3\), and \(Z = 2.326\). Rearranging the formula to solve for \(\mu\):

\[
\mu = X - Z \cdot \sigma
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\mu = 12 - 2.326 \cdot 0.3
\]

Calculating \(2.326 \cdot 0.3\):

\[
2.326 \cdot 0.3 = 0.6978
\]

Thus:

\[
\mu = 12 - 0.6978 = 11.3022
\]

This means the mean setting should be \(12 - 2.326(0.3)\). Among the given options, the one that matches this calculation is:

**J: \(12 - 2.326(0.3)\)**.
