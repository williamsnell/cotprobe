Question:

A 20-year-old man has had frequent upper respiratory tract infections over the past 4 years. He has daily purulent sputum and has noted decreased exercise tolerance over the past 2 years. He and his wife have been unable to conceive because of his low sperm count. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?

Options:

A: Bronchoscopy
B: Examination of sputum for eosinophils
C: Sputum cytology
D: Sweat chloride test
E: Chest CT scan
F: Echocardiogram
G: Spirometry repeat test
H: Tuberculin skin test
I: Complete blood count
J: Arterial blood gas analysis

Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The patient is a 20-year-old man with a history of frequent upper respiratory tract infections over the past four years. He has daily purulent sputum and decreased exercise tolerance for two years. He and his wife have had trouble conceiving because of his low sperm count. On physical exam, there's scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi in both lungs. The chest x-ray shows hyperinflation, and spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio.

Hmm, the question is asking which test would most likely confirm the diagnosis. The options are A through J, each a different test.

Let me think about the symptoms. Frequent upper respiratory infections, purulent sputum daily... That makes me think of something chronic. The fact that he's had this for years suggests maybe a condition like bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis. Also, the decreased FEV1:FVC ratio points towards an obstructive lung disease. Obstructive because FEV1 is reduced relative to FVC, so that's like asthma or COPD, but in a 20-year-old, COPD is less likely.

The chest x-ray showing hyperinflation also supports an obstructive pattern. Hyperinflation is common in conditions like asthma or cystic fibrosis. The wheezing and rhonchi further support that.

Another clue is the low sperm count. I remember that cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, which leads to infertility. So if this guy has CF, that would explain the low sperm count.

So putting it all together, the most likely diagnosis seems to be cystic fibrosis. Now, what test confirms CF?

Cystic fibrosis is typically diagnosed with a sweat chloride test. The sweat test measures the level of chloride in sweat; high levels are indicative of CF. So the sweat chloride test is the gold standard for diagnosis.

Looking at the options, option D is the sweat chloride test. So that's probably the answer.

But wait, what about other options? Let me make sure I'm not missing anything.

Option A is bronchoscopy. That could show some signs, but it's more invasive and not the first line for confirming CF.

Option B: sputum for eosinophils. Eosinophils are more about allergic reactions, like in asthma. But this patient's symptoms include purulent sputum, which is more about infection and chronic bronchitis, maybe CF-related.

Option C: sputum cytology. Maybe looking for abnormal cells, but that's more for cancer or other cytological issues, not CF.

Option D: sweat chloride. This is the key test for CF.

Option E: chest CT. It might show bronchiectasis, which is a feature of CF, but CT is not the confirmatory test, just supportive.

Option F: echocardiogram. Maybe if there's concern for cor pulmonale, but again, not the confirmatory test.

Option G: spirometry repeat. He already has abnormal spirometry, but that just shows obstruction, not the specific disease.

Option H: tuberculin skin test. For TB, but his symptoms don't strongly suggest TB, more a chronic infection pattern.

Option I: CBC. Might show signs of infection or inflammation, like leukocytosis, but not specific.

Option J: ABG. Could show hypoxemia or hypercapnia, but again, not confirming the diagnosis.

So yeah, the most likely test to confirm is the sweat chloride test, which is option D.

The patient is a 20-year-old man with a history of frequent upper respiratory tract infections, daily purulent sputum, decreased exercise tolerance, and infertility due to low sperm count. Physical examination reveals scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi, and diagnostic tests show hyperinflation on chest x-ray and a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio on spirometry. These findings suggest an obstructive lung disease, with cystic fibrosis (CF) being a strong consideration given the chronic infections, hyperinflation, and infertility.

Cystic fibrosis is often confirmed by the sweat chloride test, which measures chloride levels in sweat. Elevated chloride levels are diagnostic of CF. Other tests, such as bronchoscopy, chest CT, or spirometry, may support the diagnosis but are not definitive. The sweat chloride test is the gold standard for confirming CF.
