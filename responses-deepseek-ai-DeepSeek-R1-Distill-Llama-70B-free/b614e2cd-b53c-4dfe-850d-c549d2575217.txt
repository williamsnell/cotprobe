Okay, so I've got this question here about the FASB and how they make changes to the Accounting Standards Codification. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that FASB is the Financial Accounting Standards Board, right? They're responsible for setting accounting standards in the US. Before the Codification, there were different types of pronouncements like SFAS, SFAC, etc. But now everything is organized into the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).

The question is asking what the FASB issues to make changes to the ASC. The options are from A to J. I need to pick the right one.

I think the FASB used to issue Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) before the Codification. But after the Codification was introduced, they started issuing something else for updates. Oh right, they began releasing Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) to make changes. So each ASU amends the Codification.

Looking at the options, option B is Accounting Standards Updates. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, let me make sure. Other options: E is SFAS, which was before the Codification. So E is probably not correct anymore because after Codification, they don't issue SFAS anymore. They use ASUs instead.

What about option C, Emerging Issues Task Force Releases? I think EITF releases are part of the process but maybe they're not the actual updates. They might discuss and reach consensus on emerging issues, and then the FASB would issue an ASU based on that.

Option A is Staff Technical Bulletins. I think those are more like guidance from the staff, maybe not the official updates.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident the answer is B: Accounting Standards Updates.

The FASB makes changes to the Accounting Standards Codification by issuing Accounting Standards Updates. These updates, known as ASUs, are used to amend the Codification. Prior to the Codification, the FASB issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS), but since the Codification's introduction, ASUs have become the standard method for updates. Other options, such as EITF Releases or Staff Technical Bulletins, are not the primary means of updating the Codification.

Answer: B
