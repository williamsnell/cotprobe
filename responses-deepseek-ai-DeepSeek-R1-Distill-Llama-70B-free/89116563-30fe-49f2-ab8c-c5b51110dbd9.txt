Okay, so I need to solve this finance problem about Parker Bros accepting a draft and then discounting it. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the draft is for $3500 with 6% interest, dated April 5th and due in 6 months. So the due date would be October 5th because April has 30 days, so adding 6 months would take us to October. Wait, no, wait. If it's due in 6 months after April 5, then yes, October 5. Because April 5 plus 6 months is October 5.

Now, it was discounted on August 20th at a discount rate of 6.5%. So the bank is going to give Parker Bros the present value of that draft, minus some fees. Also, there's a collection fee of 1/3 percent, which is 0.333...%. So I think I need to calculate the present value of the draft as of August 20th, then subtract the collection fee.

Wait, the process is: when a draft is discounted, the bank pays the present value immediately, and the bank's fee is usually deducted from the proceeds. So the proceeds Parker Bros receive would be the present value minus any fees.

So first, I need to find out the time period between April 5 and August 20. Let me calculate the number of days. April has 30 days, so from April 5 to April 30 is 25 days. Then May has 31, June 30, July 31, and August 20. Let's add them up:

April: 25 days (from 5th to 30th inclusive)
May: 31
June: 30
July:31
August:20
Total days: 25 +31=56; 56+30=86; 86+31=117; 117+20=137 days.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, when you count days between two dates, do you include both the start and end dates? Hmm, but in finance, for discounting, it's usually the number of days the money is held. So from April 5 to August 20 is how many days? Let me check that more accurately.

April 5 to April 30 is 25 days (since 30-5+1=26? Wait, no. From April 5 to April 30 is 25 days because April 5 is day 1, 6 is day 2, ..., 30 is day 26. So 26 days minus the starting day? Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently.

Alternatively, use the formula for days between two dates, but perhaps a simpler way is to count the months and then the days.

Wait, another approach: the due date is October 5, and it's being discounted on August 20. So the time from August 20 to October 5 is the remaining period. Wait, no, wait. The draft is due on October 5, so when it's discounted on August 20, the time remaining is from August 20 to October 5.

Wait, no, wait, wait. The draft is accepted on April 5 and is due in 6 months, so it's due on October 5. When it's discounted on August 20, the time from April 5 to August 20 is the period that's already passed, so the remaining time until maturity is from August 20 to October 5.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. When you discount a note, you calculate the present value based on the remaining time until maturity. So the discounting is done on August 20, so the time remaining is from August 20 to October 5.

So the number of days from August 20 to October 5 is:

August has 31 days, so from August 20 to August 31 is 12 days (including the 20th? Or not? Wait, when calculating the days between August 20 and August 31, it's 31-20=11 days, but if you include both start and end, it's 12 days. Hmm, but in finance, typically, the day of discounting is counted as day 0, so perhaps it's better to use 365 days for calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the formula for simple interest, calculating the time in years.

Wait, the interest rate on the draft is 6%, so the face value is $3500, and it's a 6-month draft. Wait, but when you discount a note, you calculate the present value using the discount rate.

Wait, but the draft itself bears interest, so perhaps the amount at maturity is $3500 plus interest. Wait, no, wait. When a draft is accepted, the face value usually includes the interest, but sometimes it's just the principal. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The problem says the draft is for $3500 bearing interest at 6%, dated April 5, due in 6 months. So the maturity value would be $3500 plus 6% interest for 6 months. Wait, but sometimes drafts are non-interest bearing, but this one says it's bearing interest. So maybe the $3500 is the principal, and the interest is 6% per annum, so for 6 months, it's 3% on $3500.

So the maturity value would be $3500 + (3500 * 6% * (6/12)) = $3500 + (3500 * 0.06 * 0.5) = $3500 + $105 = $3605. So when it's due on October 5, the total to be paid is $3605.

Wait, but when the draft is discounted on August 20, the present value is calculated based on the discount rate. So the present value (PV) is the maturity value divided by (1 + discount rate * time in years).

Wait, but I think I'm mixing up things. Let me clarify: when you discount a note, you're finding the present value of the future amount using the discount rate. The formula is PV = FV / (1 + r * t), where r is the discount rate, and t is the time in years until maturity.

Wait, but wait, the discount rate here is 6.5%, and the time from August 20 to October 5 is how many days? Let's calculate that.

From August 20 to August 31: 12 days (since 31-20+1=12)
September: 30 days
October 1 to October 5: 5 days
Total days: 12+30+5=47 days.

Wait, but another way: August 20 to October 5.

August has 31 days, so from August 20 to August 31 is 12 days (31-20+1=12). Then September has 30, and October 5 is 5 days. So total is 12 + 30 +5=47 days.

So 47 days is the time remaining until maturity. To convert that into years, we divide by 365. So 47/365 ≈ 0.1288 years.

Now, the discount rate is 6.5%, so r=0.065.

So the present value PV is FV / (1 + r * t).

FV is the maturity value, which we calculated as $3605.

So PV = 3605 / (1 + 0.065 * (47/365)).

Wait, let me compute the denominator first. 0.065 * (47/365) = ?

47/365 is approximately 0.1288.

0.065 * 0.1288 ≈ 0.008368.

So 1 + 0.008368 = 1.008368.

So PV ≈ 3605 / 1.008368 ≈ Let me compute that.

3605 / 1.008368. Let me do this division.

Well, 3605 ÷ 1.008368 ≈ ?

Alternatively, perhaps approximate it more accurately. Let me compute 1.008368 times 3575, which is one of the options, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the discount first. The discount is FV * r * t. So discount = 3605 * 0.065 * (47/365).

Compute 0.065 * (47/365) = 0.065 * 0.1288 ≈ 0.008368.

Then 3605 * 0.008368 ≈ Let's calculate that.

3605 * 0.008 = 28.84
3605 * 0.000368 ≈ 3605 * 0.0003 = 1.0815; 3605 * 0.000068 ≈ 0.245. So total ≈ 1.0815 + 0.245 ≈ 1.3265
So total discount ≈ 28.84 + 1.3265 ≈ 30.1665.

So the present value is 3605 - 30.1665 ≈ 3574.83.

But wait, this is the present value before any collection fees. The bank charges a 1/3% collection fee on the proceeds. So the collection fee would be 1/3% of the present value.

Wait, the collection fee is usually deducted from the proceeds. So proceeds = PV - (PV * collection fee rate).

So the collection fee is (1/3)% which is approximately 0.003333.

So proceeds = PV * (1 - 0.003333) = PV * 0.996667.

So taking PV as approximately 3574.83, then proceeds = 3574.83 * 0.996667 ≈ Let's calculate.

3574.83 * 0.996667 ≈ 3574.83 - (3574.83 * 0.003333).

3574.83 * 0.003333 ≈ 11.915.

So proceeds ≈ 3574.83 - 11.915 ≈ 3562.915.

Looking at the options, option J is $3563.04, which is very close. So perhaps my approximation is a bit off, but I think that's the correct approach.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations more accurately.

First, the maturity value: $3500 * (1 + 0.06*(6/12)) = 3500*(1+0.03) = 3500*1.03 = $3605. So that's correct.

Time from August 20 to October 5: 47 days.

So time in years: 47/365 = 0.12876712.

Discount rate is 6.5%, so 0.065.

Discount amount: 3605 * 0.065 * (47/365).

Compute 0.065 * (47/365) first.

47/365 = 0.12876712.

0.065 * 0.12876712 = 0.008370.

So discount is 3605 * 0.008370 = Let me compute this accurately.

3605 * 0.008 = 28.84
3605 * 0.000370 = Let's compute 3605 * 0.0003 = 1.0815, 3605 * 0.00007=0.25235. So total 1.0815 + 0.25235 = 1.33385.

So total discount is 28.84 + 1.33385 ≈ 30.17385.

So present value is 3605 - 30.17385 ≈ 3574.82615.

Now, the collection fee is 1/3% on the proceeds. So proceeds = PV * (1 - 0.00333333).

So 3574.82615 * (1 - 0.00333333) = 3574.82615 * 0.99666667.

Let me compute this accurately.

3574.82615 * 0.99666667.

Let me compute 3574.82615 * 0.99666667.

Alternatively, 0.99666667 is 3574.82615 * (1 - 1/300) ≈ but perhaps it's easier to compute as:

3574.82615 - (3574.82615 * (1/3)%).

Compute (1/3)% of 3574.82615: 3574.82615 * 0.00333333.

3574.82615 * 0.003 = 10.72447845.

3574.82615 * 0.00033333 ≈ 3574.82615 * 0.0003 = 1.072447845; 3574.82615 * 0.00003333 ≈ 0.119158.

So total ≈ 10.72447845 + 1.072447845 + 0.119158 ≈ 11.9150843.

So proceeds ≈ 3574.82615 - 11.9150843 ≈ 3562.91107.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J: $3563.04.

Wait, but let me check if I made any errors in the discount calculation. Perhaps I should compute using more precise decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute using the simple interest formula without subtracting the discount first, but I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: the present value is FV divided by (1 + rt), using simple interest.

So FV is $3605, r is 6.5%, t is 47/365.

So PV = 3605 / (1 + 0.065*(47/365)).

Let me compute 0.065*(47/365) = 0.065 * 0.128767123 ≈ 0.008370.

So denominator is 1.008370.

So PV = 3605 / 1.008370 ≈ Let me compute this division more accurately.

3605 ÷ 1.008370.

Let me approximate:

1.008370 * 3575 = ?

Compute 3575 * 1.008370:

3575 * 1 = 3575

3575 * 0.008370 = let's compute that.

3575 * 0.008 = 28.6

3575 * 0.000370 = approx 1.3225

So total 28.6 + 1.3225 = 29.9225

So 3575 * 1.008370 ≈ 3575 + 29.9225 ≈ 3604.9225.

Hmm, but FV is 3605, so perhaps 3575 is a bit low.

Wait, 3575 * 1.008370 ≈ 3604.92, which is very close to 3605. So the PV is approximately $3575. So after subtracting the collection fee, which is 1/3% of PV, it would be $3575 - (3575 * 0.003333) = 3575 - 11.916 ≈ 3563.08, which is close to option J: 3563.04.

Wait, but the exact calculation might give a slightly different result. Let me do more precise calculations.

Compute 3605 / 1.008370.

Let me write it as 3605 ÷ 1.008370.

Using a calculator approach:

1.008370 × 3575 = 3604.92 as before, which is just under 3605. So perhaps 3575.04 would give exactly 3605.

So 3575.04 × 1.008370 = 3575.04 + (3575.04 × 0.008370).

Compute 3575.04 × 0.008370:

3575 × 0.008370 = 29.92 as before, and 0.04 ×0.008370=0.000335. So total ≈ 29.920335.

So 3575.04 + 29.920335 ≈ 3605. So yes, 3575.04 is the PV.

Now, the collection fee is 1/3% of 3575.04.

1/3% is 0.00333333.

So 3575.04 × 0.00333333 ≈ let's compute.

3575 × 0.00333333 = 11.91666.

0.04 × 0.00333333 ≈ 0.00013333.

Total fee ≈ 11.91666 + 0.00013333 ≈ 11.9168.

So proceeds = 3575.04 - 11.9168 ≈ 3563.1232.

Looking at the options, option J is $3563.04, which is very close. The slight difference might be due to rounding during intermediate steps.

So the correct answer should be option J: $3563.04.

To determine the proceeds Parker Bros received after discounting the draft, we need to calculate the present value of the draft as of August 20, considering the discount rate and the collection fee. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Maturity Value Calculation**:  
   The draft is for $3500 with an annual interest rate of 6%, and it is due in 6 months. The maturity value is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Maturity Value} = 3500 \times (1 + 0.06 \times \frac{6}{12}) = 3500 \times 1.03 = 3605
   \]

2. **Time Remaining Until Maturity**:  
   The draft is discounted on August 20, and it matures on October 5. The number of days remaining is:  
   - August 20 to August 31: 12 days  
   - September: 30 days  
   - October 1 to October 5: 5 days  
   Total = \(12 + 30 + 5 = 47 \, \text{days}\).  
   Converting this to years:  
   \[
   t = \frac{47}{365} \approx 0.1288 \, \text{years}.
   \]

3. **Present Value Calculation**:  
   The present value (PV) is calculated using the discount rate of 6.5% (0.065) and the formula:  
   \[
   PV = \frac{\text{FV}}{1 + r \times t}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   PV = \frac{3605}{1 + 0.065 \times 0.1288} = \frac{3605}{1.008368} \approx 3575.04
   \]

4. **Collection Fee**:  
   The bank charges a collection fee of \( \frac{1}{3}\% \) (0.003333) on the present value. The fee is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Fee} = 3575.04 \times 0.003333 \approx
