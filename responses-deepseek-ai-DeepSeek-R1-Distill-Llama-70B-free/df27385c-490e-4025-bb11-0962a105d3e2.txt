Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Ethernets, and I'm trying to figure out which statement is false. I'm a bit rusty on my networking concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which statement is typically false about Ethernets. The options are A through D. Let's go through each one.

Option A: "Ethernet protocols use a collision-detection method to ensure that messages are transmitted properly." I remember that Ethernet uses something called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD). So when two devices try to send data at the same time, a collision happens, and they detect it. Then they wait for a random time before trying again. So A sounds true. So this isn't the false statement.

Option B: "Ethernets use circuit switching to send messages." Hmm. Circuit switching is a method where a dedicated communication path is established between two nodes before any data is sent. I think examples are traditional telephone networks. But Ethernet, I believe, uses packet switching instead. In packet switching, data is broken into packets, and each packet finds its way through the network. So B is saying Ethernets use circuit switching, which I think is incorrect. So B might be the false statement. But I'll check the other options to be sure.

Option C: "Networks connected by Ethernets are limited in length to a few hundred meters." I remember that Ethernet cables have distance limitations. Like, the maximum length for a segment is around 100 meters for CAT5, but it can vary a bit with different cable types. So C is saying a few hundred meters, which is longer than the typical max. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, actually, some Ethernet variants can go up to a few hundred meters, but traditional ones are limited. Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up. Or perhaps the question is referring to a single segment. Because when you have multiple segments connected by switches or repeaters, the overall network can be larger. But the statement says "networks connected by Ethernets" which might be implying the entire network, not a single cable run. So I'm a bit confused here. I'll have to think more about this.

Option D: "Ethernets use buses with multiple masters." Wait, in the past, Ethernet used a bus topology, right? Like a single cable where all devices tap in. And in that setup, every device can be a master, meaning any can send. So D sounds correct. So the false statement isn't D.

Back to option B. So if B is about circuit switching, which I thought is wrong. Because Ethernet uses packet switching. So B is false.

Wait, option C: If the maximum cable length is around 100 meters, then a few hundred meters would be false. But wait, some Ethernet types like 10Gbps may have longer ranges, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is talking about the entire network's maximum length, but I think the limit is per segment, and with hubs or switches, you can extend it beyond that. So the statement in C would be true. Because each segment can't be more than a few hundred meters, but the entire network can be larger. Wait, the question says "networks connected by Ethernets are limited in length to a few hundred meters." Hmm, maybe that's not accurate. Let me think: a single Ethernet segment can't be longer than a certain length, like 100 meters for UTP. But the overall network can be much larger by using switches and routers. So the statement in C is false if it's talking about the entire network. Wait, no. Wait, the option says "limited in length to a few hundred meters." So if the maximum for a single segment is 100 meters, then a few hundred would be longer than that, which would make option C false. But wait, the option is a statement, so if it's saying that the networks are limited to a few hundred meters, that would be incorrect because the overall network can be much larger, but individual segments can't. So perhaps the statement in C is false. But I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, the question is about which statement is false. So let's recap:

Option B: Ethernets use circuit switching. If that's wrong, then B is the false statement.

Option C: If it's saying the network's total length is limited to a few hundred meters, that's false because you can have much larger networks with multiple segments. So C would be false if that's the case.

Wait, the way the options are phrased is important.

Option C says "limited in length to a few hundred meters." So if the maximum cable run is 100 meters, then a few hundred would exceed that, making the statement incorrect. So perhaps C is false.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. What's the maximum length for an Ethernet cable? For example, Cat5 is 100 meters (about 328 feet). So a few hundred meters would be beyond that, which isn't possible. So the statement in C would be false because the limit is much lower. So in that case, C is false.

Wait, but another thought: some Ethernet types, like 10BASE5 (thicknet), have a longer maximum segment length. 10BASE5 can go up to 500 meters, which is a few hundred. So in that case, C would be correct. So perhaps C is true, making B the false statement.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me clarify:

The question is which statement is false.

Option B: Ethernets use circuit switching. I'm pretty sure that's wrong. Ethernet uses packet switching, so B is false.

So the false statement is B. So the correct answer is B.

To determine which statement about Ethernets is typically false, let's analyze each option:

**Option A:** "Ethernet protocols use a collision-detection method to ensure that messages are transmitted properly."  
This is true. Ethernet uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) to detect and handle collisions when two devices transmit data simultaneously. Thus, this statement is correct.

**Option B:** "Ethernets use circuit switching to send messages."  
This is false. Ethernet uses packet switching, where data is broken into packets and transmitted independently through the network. Circuit switching, which establishes a dedicated communication path before data transmission, is not used in Ethernet.

**Option C:** "Networks connected by Ethernets are limited in length to a few hundred meters."  
This is true. While the maximum length of a single Ethernet segment is limited (e.g., 100 meters for Cat5 cable), the overall network can extend beyond this by using devices like switches and repeaters. However, the statement refers to the limitation of individual segments, which aligns with the few hundred meters constraint for certain Ethernet types (e.g., 10BASE5 thicknet can reach up to 500 meters). Therefore, this statement is correct.

**Option D:** "Ethernets use buses with multiple masters."  
This is true. Ethernet originally used a bus topology where all devices shared a common cable, and any device could act as a master to transmit data. Thus, this statement is correct.

The false statement is **Option B**, as Ethernet does not use circuit switching but rather packet switching. 

**Answer: B**
