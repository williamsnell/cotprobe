Okay, so I need to figure out which early battle led to the conversion of Mecca. Hmm, I remember that Mecca was the holy city where Muhammad was born, and it was a key place for the early Muslims. The conversion of Mecca probably happened after some significant event.

I think the Hijra was when Muhammad moved from Mecca to Medina, right? So after that, he started building his community there. There were several battles fought between the Muslims and the Meccans. The first major battle was Badr, which I think the Muslims won. But did that lead to Mecca converting? I don't think so because there were more battles after that.

Wait, there's also the Battle of the Trench, which was when the Meccans attacked Medina but were repelled. That's also known as the Battle of the Confederates. But that doesn't seem directly connected to Mecca's conversion.

Oh, right, the Treaty of Hudaybiyah! That was a peace treaty between Muhammad and the Meccans. I think that happened a few years after Hijra, maybe around 6 AH. The treaty allowed Muslims to visit Mecca for pilgrimage, which was a significant step. But I'm not sure if that's the battle in question because it was a treaty, not a battle.

Wait, the question is about a battle leading to Mecca's conversion. So maybe it's the Conquest of Mecca, but that wasn't a battle per se because it was more of a peaceful takeover. Or was there a battle right before that?

Wait, I think before the Conquest of Mecca, there was the Battle of Hunayn. Let me recall, Hunayn was a valley near Mecca. After the Conquest, Muhammad defeated the Hawazin tribe there. Oh wait, no, the Conquest of Mecca happened without a major battle. So the Battle of Hunayn might have been after the Conquest.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think in order. The Hijra was in 622 CE. The first battle was Badr in 624. Then Uhud in 625, where Muslims lost. Then the Trench in 627, which they won. Then maybe the Treaty of Hudaybiyah in 628, leading up to the Conquest of Mecca in 630, which was peaceful because the Meccans surrendered without much resistance.

So if the Conquest led to Mecca converting, but it wasn't a battle. So maybe the question is referring to the events leading up to it. Alternatively, perhaps the Battle of Hunayn, which was after the Conquest. Because after Mecca fell, some tribes resisted, and Muhammad went to fight them. So Hunayn was in 630, same year as the Conquest.

Wait, but the conversion of Mecca was when Muhammad took the city and the people accepted Islam. So the actual event was the Conquest without a battle. But the question is about a battle leading to it.

Alternatively, maybe the Battle of Ta'if, which was after Hunayn. But Ta'if was a siege and the people didn't convert immediately. So that might not be it.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the Battle of Hudaybiyah, but that was a treaty, not a battle. So maybe the correct answer is the Battle of Hunayn. Because after that, Muhammad returned and the Meccans had already surrendered, leading to their conversion.

Wait, no, the Conquest of Mecca happened before Hunayn. Let me check the timeline again. The Conquest was in January 630, then Muhammad went to Hunayn in the same year, maybe a few months later. So if the battle was Hunayn, that's after Mecca's conversion.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option:

A: Badr - First battle, but Mecca didn't convert yet.
C: Hunayn - After the Conquest.
D: Mut'ah - That was against the Byzantines, I think, and a loss.
E: Tabuk - Later battle, maybe against Byzantines.
F: Khaybar - Against Jews, not Mecca.
G: Camel - Part of the fitna, much later.
H: Trench - Defense of Medina.
I: Ta'if - After Conquest.
J: Uhud - Loss, so no.

Wait, so perhaps the Conquest of Mecca itself isn't one of the options. The question is about a battle leading to it. Maybe the Treaty of Hudaybiyah was a result of a battle, but I don't think so. Alternatively, the Battle of the Trench weakened the Meccans, leading to their eventual surrender.

Wait, no. The Trench was in 627, and the Conquest was in 630. So between them, the Muslims became stronger. But the actual trigger was when the Meccans broke the Treaty of Hudaybiyah by attacking the Banu Bakr tribe. So Muhammad gathered an army and marched on Mecca, leading to its surrender without a fight.

So the event that led directly was the breaking of the treaty. But the question is about a battle. Maybe none of the options directly, but the closest would be the Battle of Hunayn, which was after Mecca.

Alternatively, perhaps the Battle of the Trench made the Meccans realize they couldn't defeat the Muslims, leading them to eventually surrender. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the Battle of Khaybar was in 628, which was a Jewish fortress. After that, the Muslims' power increased, which might have influenced Mecca's decision.

Alternatively, the Battle of Mut'ah was in 629, against the Byzantines. It was a loss, but led to more support for Muhammad.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think: which battle directly preceded the fall of Mecca? I think it was the Conquest, but that wasn't a battle. So perhaps the answer is C: Hunayn, but that was after.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is the Conquest, but since it's not an option, maybe the question refers to the events that led to it. Alternatively, maybe the Battle of Ta'if, but that was after Mecca.

Wait, another approach: the conversion of Mecca happened during the Conquest, which was a peaceful takeover. So the battle that led to it would be the one that made the Meccans realize they couldn't resist. Maybe the Battle of the Trench, showing that Medina was secure. Or perhaps the Treaty of Hudaybiyah, which was a result of a standoff, not a battle.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is the Battle of Hunayn. Because after Hunayn, Muhammad's power was at its peak, leading to Mecca's conversion. But I thought the Conquest happened before Hunayn.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to remember the order again. The Hijra in 622. Then Badr (624), Uhud (625), Trench (627), Hudaybiyah (628), then the Conquest of Mecca (630), then Hunayn (630), then Tabuk (631).

So the Conquest of Mecca was in early 630, and then Hunayn happened later that same year. So the conversion of Mecca was due to the Conquest, which wasn't a battle. So perhaps the question is a bit tricky, and the answer is that there was no battle, but the options don't include that.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is the Battle of Hunayn. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the Conquest is considered a battle, but I don't think so because it was more of a peaceful surrender. So perhaps the correct answer is C: Battle of Hunayn.

Wait, but after the Conquest, the Meccans had already converted. So I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about what each battle resulted in.

The Battle of Badr: First major victory, boosted morale but didn't lead to Mecca's conversion.

Uhud: Loss, so not relevant.

Trench: Repelled the Meccans, showed strength but Mecca didn't convert yet.

Hudaybiyah: Treaty allowing access to Mecca, but not a battle.

Khaybar: Jewish tribe defeated, gave more resources to Muslims.

Mut'ah: Loss against Byzantines, but not related.

Tabuk: Against Byzantines, later.

Camel and others: Part of later conflicts.

Hunayn: After Conquest, so probably not.

Wait, perhaps the answer is none of the above, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C: Hunayn. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is I: Ta'if, but that was after.

Wait, no. The Battle of Ta'if was after the Conquest of Mecca. So the answer must be C: Hunayn.

Wait, but I'm not certain. I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should go with C.

The question asks which early battle led to the conversion of Mecca. To determine this, it is important to consider the timeline of events in early Islamic history and the role of each battle.

1. **Battle of Badr (624 CE)**: This was the first major battle fought by the Muslims and resulted in a victory. However, it did not lead to the conversion of Mecca, as the Meccans continued to resist.

2. **Battle of Uhud (625 CE)**: This battle was a loss for the Muslims and does not relate to the conversion of Mecca.

3. **Battle of the Trench (627 CE)**: This battle, also known as the Battle of the Confederates, was a defensive victory for the Muslims. While it demonstrated the growing strength of the Muslim community, it did not directly lead to the conversion of Mecca.

4. **Treaty of Hudaybiyah (628 CE)**: This was a peace treaty between Muhammad and the Meccans, allowing Muslims to visit Mecca for pilgrimage. While it was a significant step, it was not a battle.

5. **Conquest of Mecca (630 CE)**: This event marked the peaceful surrender of Mecca to Muhammad, leading to the conversion of its people. However, it was not a battle but a negotiated surrender.

6. **Battle of Hunayn (630 CE)**: This battle occurred after the Conquest of Mecca, as Muhammad defeated the Hawazin tribe. Since it took place after the conversion of Mecca, it cannot be the correct answer.

7. **Other Battles (e.g., Khaybar, Mut'ah, Tabuk, Ta'if)**: These battles were fought against other tribes or enemies and did not directly lead to the conversion of Mecca.

Given the options, the Battle of Hunayn is the closest in time to the conversion of Mecca, even though it occurred after the Conquest. Therefore, based on the provided options, the answer is:

C: The Battle of Hunayn.

Answer: C
