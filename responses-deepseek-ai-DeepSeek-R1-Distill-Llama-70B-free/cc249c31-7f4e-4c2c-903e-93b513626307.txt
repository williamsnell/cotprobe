Okay, so I've got this physics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about electromagnetic induction, which I remember is related to how voltages are induced in wire loops. Let me think this through step by step.

The question asks when a voltage is induced in a wire loop, specifically in relation to the magnetic field within that loop. The options are A to I, each giving a different condition. I need to pick the correct condition.

From what I remember in class, Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction is the key here. Faraday's Law states that a changing magnetic field in a loop induces an electromotive force (EMF), which is like a voltage. So the main idea is that the magnetic field has to be changing over time. If the magnetic field is static or unchanging, no voltage is induced.

Looking at the options:

Option A: is amplified. Well, if the magnetic field's strength is increasing, that's a change, so this might fit. But wait, the question is about the condition when a voltage is induced, so any change would do, not just amplification.

Option B: converts to magnetic energy. Hmm, not sure about this. Magnetic energy is a form of energy storage, but I don't think the conversion process itself directly relates to induced voltage. Voltage is induced due to change in the field, not necessarily energy conversion.

Option C: is parallel to the electric field. I don't think the orientation relative to an electric field matters here. The question is about the magnetic field's state, not its relation to an electric field.

Option D: changes. Oh, this looks promising. Faraday's Law says a changing magnetic field induces voltage. So if the magnetic field changes, whether in strength, direction, or both, a voltage is induced.

Option E: is at right angles to the electric field. Again, I don't think the angle between magnetic and electric fields is the determining factor here. It's more about the change in the magnetic field itself.

Option F: converts to electric energy. That sounds more like what happens in a generator, but the cause is the change in the magnetic field, not the conversion process itself.

Option G: aligns with the electric field. Similar to C and E, this is about orientation, which I don't think is the main factor. The key is the change in the magnetic field.

Option H: is at a 45-degree angle to the electric field. Again, not relevant. The angle doesn't directly cause induction.

Option I: is static. Static means unchanging. If the magnetic field isn't changing, no voltage is induced. So this is the opposite of what we're looking for.

So putting it all together, the correct condition for inducing a voltage is when the magnetic field changes. That's option D.

The correct answer is based on Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction, which states that a voltage is induced in a wire loop when the magnetic field within the loop changes over time. This change can involve the strength, direction, or both. Among the given options, only option D directly aligns with this principle.

Answer: D
