Question:

What is cognitive dissonance as explained byFestinger?

Options:

A: Cognitive dissonance is a learning theory that describes the process by which people adapt their behavior to match their intentions
B: Cognitive dissonance is a condition where an individual experiences difficulty in decision-making due to the presence of too many choices
C: Cognitive dissonance is a motivational theory that suggests individuals are driven to change their attitudes when they experience positive reinforcement
D: Cognitive dissonance is a theory about memory retention
E: Cognitive dissonance is a state of mind where an individual is completely aware and accepting of their conflicting attitudes
F: Cognitive dissonance is a theory about emotional stability
G: Cognitive dissonance is a psychological phenomenon where an individual's beliefs are in harmony with their actions at all times
H: Cognitive dissonance is a theory about personality traits
I: Cognitive dissonance is a theory that states that cognitions can have one of three relations to one another - consonant, irrelevant, or dissonant. Dissonant cognitions result in contradictory behaviors, and the experience of dissonance is a negative motivational state that aims at reducing the dissonance.
J: Cognitive dissonance is a social theory that explains the dynamics of group decision-making

Okay, so I've got this question about cognitive dissonance as explained by Festinger. I remember that Festinger is the guy who came up with this theory. Let me think. I think cognitive dissonance has to do with conflicting thoughts or feelings causing discomfort. So when someone's beliefs or actions clash, they feel this discomfort and are motivated to reduce it.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one to see which fits best. 

Option A says it's a learning theory about adapting behavior to match intentions. I don't think that's right. Learning theories I remember are more about observing and imitating, like Bandura's stuff. Dissonance is more about internal conflict.

Option B is about too many choices causing difficulty. That sounds more like the paradox of choice, which is a different concept. So B is probably not it.

Option C mentions changing attitudes with positive reinforcement. That sounds like operant conditioning, where rewards shape behavior. But cognitive dissonance is more about internal inconsistency leading to change, not necessarily because of rewards.

Option D is about memory retention. I don't think that's related. Dissonance is more about emotions and motivations than memory.

Option E says the person is aware and accepting of conflicting attitudes. No, I think dissonance causes discomfort, so people aren't just accepting it. They try to reduce it.

Option F is about emotional stability. That's part of it, but not the whole theory. Dissonance is a specific state, not overall stability.

Option G claims beliefs are always in harmony with actions. That's the opposite of dissonance. Dissonance occurs when they're not in harmony.

Option H is about personality traits. I don't think that's correct. Dissonance is a situational theory, not about personality.

Option I says cognitions can be consonant, irrelevant, or dissonant, with dissonance causing negative motivation to reduce it. This sounds accurate. It describes the three possible relations and the effect of dissonance.

Option J is about group decision-making. That's more like social theories or groupthink, not dissonance.

So the correct answer should be I. It captures the essence of Festinger's theory by explaining the types of cognitions and the resulting discomfort that leads to change.

The correct answer is I. Cognitive dissonance, as explained by Festinger, refers to a psychological state where an individual experiences discomfort due to conflicting thoughts or actions. This theory posits that cognitions can be consonant, irrelevant, or dissonant. Dissonant cognitions create a negative motivational state, driving individuals to reduce the discomfort by altering their beliefs or behaviors.

Answer: I
