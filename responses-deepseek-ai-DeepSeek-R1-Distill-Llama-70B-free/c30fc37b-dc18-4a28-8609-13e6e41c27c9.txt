Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about corporate law, specifically regarding the removal of directors. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the rules around removing directors can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the corporation's articles. The question is about what happens when there's no specific provision in the articles of incorporation.

The question asks: In the absence of a provision to the contrary in the articles of incorporation, the directors of a corporation elected for a specified term... and then it gives several options.

I think the key here is understanding the default rule when the articles don't specify. I recall that under the Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA), which many states follow, directors can generally be removed with or without cause. But wait, isn't there something about shareholder meetings and majorities?

Let me think. If the articles don't say anything, then the default rule applies. In most jurisdictions, unless the articles state otherwise, directors can be removed by the shareholders. And I think the default is that they can be removed with or without cause. So the shareholders don't need a specific reason; a simple majority vote at a meeting should suffice.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember that some states require cause for removal, but under the MBCA, the default is that directors can be removed without cause. So if the articles don't have any provisions, then the shareholders can remove them at a meeting, with or without cause.

Looking at the options:

Option E says: can be removed from office at a meeting of the shareholders, with or without cause. That sounds right based on what I remember.

Option C says they cannot be removed before their term expires. That would be true only if the articles have a specific provision, but the question says there isn't one. So C is incorrect.

Option I says only for cause. That might be the case in some jurisdictions, but under the MBCA default, it's not required. So I think I is incorrect.

Option A requires a two-thirds majority. I don't think that's the default; I believe the default is a majority unless specified otherwise. So A is probably wrong.

Option H mentions removal only for cause and after an opportunity to be heard. That seems more like a due process requirement, which might apply in some cases, but the question is about the general rule. So H is not the correct default.

Options D, F, G, J all have specific conditions that I don't think are part of the default rule. D says only the board can remove, which I don't think is right because shareholders typically have that power. F requires a court decree, which is more extreme. G needs a unanimous vote, which is too strict. J requires a replacement, but I don't recall that being a default condition.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be E. Directors can be removed by shareholders at a meeting with or without cause.

In the absence of a provision to the contrary in the articles of incorporation, the default rule under the Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA) and many jurisdictions allows shareholders to remove directors with or without cause. This means that a majority vote at a shareholders' meeting is sufficient for removal, and no specific conditions like cause, a supermajority, or court intervention are required unless stipulated in the articles. 

Analyzing the options:

- **E** correctly reflects the default rule that directors can be removed at a meeting of the shareholders, with or without cause.  
- Other options impose additional conditions (e.g., requiring cause, a supermajority, or court involvement) that are not part of the default rule.  

Thus, the correct answer is **E**.

Answer: E
