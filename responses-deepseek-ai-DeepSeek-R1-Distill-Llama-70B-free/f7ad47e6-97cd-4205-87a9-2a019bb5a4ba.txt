Okay, so I've got this question about skeletal muscle and the energy it can produce. Hmm, let's see. I remember that muscles use ATP and phosphocreatine as their main high-energy compounds. The question is asking how much work a 400-gram muscle can do using just these, with glycolysis and respiration inhibited. So no additional ATP production from other sources.

The data given is that per gram wet weight, there's 5e-6 mole of ATP and 30e-6 mole of phosphocreatine. Wait, I think phosphocreatine is also called creatine phosphate. And when it breaks down, it donates a phosphate to ADP to make ATP, right? So each phosphocreatine can generate one ATP.

So for each gram, total high-energy phosphate is ATP plus phosphocreatine. Oh wait, because each phosphocreatine can make one ATP. So the total ATP available per gram would be the initial ATP plus the phosphocreatine.

Let me break it down. For one gram:
- ATP: 5e-6 mol
- Phosphocreatine (PCr): 30e-6 mol

So total ATP available is 5e-6 + 30e-6 = 35e-6 mol per gram.

But wait, when PCr breaks down, it forms ATP. But each PCr molecule contributes one ATP. So the initial ATP is 5e-6, and the PCr can make 30e-6 more. So the total is 35e-6 per gram.

Since the muscle is 400 grams, the total would be 400 * 35e-6. Let me calculate that.

35e-6 is 0.000035. Multiply by 400: 0.000035 * 400 = 0.014 moles of ATP.

Now, each mole of ATP provides about 10,000 calories? Wait, no, wait. I think I'm mixing things up. Oh right, the energy per mole of ATP is about 10,000 calories, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the correct value is that the hydrolysis of one mole of ATP yields about 10,000 calories. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would be way too high. Oh wait, no, I might be confusing units. Let me recall: I think it's about 7.3 kcal per mole of ATP. Wait, no, wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, I think each mole of ATP hydrolysis releases about 7.3 kcal. But wait, I've also heard that during cellular respiration, each glucose molecule produces up to 38 ATP, but that's under ideal conditions, but that's not relevant here. Wait, no, the question is about the energy from the phosphate bonds. So each ATP broken down gives about 7.3 kcal per mole. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's that each mole of ATP is about 1,300 calories. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, I'm getting this mixed up.

Let me double-check. I recall that the energy stored in ATP is about 30-40 kJ per mole. Oh wait, that's in kJ. So 1 mole of ATP is about 7.3 kcal because 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So 30 kJ is approximately 7.16 kcal. So yeah, about 7.3 kcal per mole of ATP.

So if I have 0.014 moles of ATP, then the energy is 0.014 * 7.3 kcal.

Let me compute that. 0.014 *7.3 = let's see, 0.01 *7.3 = 0.073, and 0.004 *7.3=0.0292. Summing them gives 0.1022 kcal. Wait, that's only about 0.1 kcal? That can't be right because the answer options are in the tens of calories.

Wait, I must have made a mistake. Let me go back. Oh wait, the units in the problem might be in millimoles or micromoles. Wait, the question says 5 ×10^-6 mole of ATP per gram. So 5e-6 per gram. So for 400 grams, it's 400 *5e-6 = 2e-3 moles of ATP.

But wait, the phosphocreatine is 30e-6 per gram, so 400 *30e-6 is 12e-3 moles.

But each of those can generate one ATP, so the phosphocreatine contributes an additional 12e-3 moles of ATP. So total ATP is 2e-3 +12e-3=14e-3 moles, which is 0.014 moles.

Wait, that's correct. Then 0.014 moles times 7.3 kcal per mole would be 0.014 *7.3 = let's compute that. 0.01 *7.3 is 0.073. 0.004 *7.3 is 0.0292. So 0.1022 kcal. But that's about 0.1 kcal, which is 100 Joules, but the options are way higher. So I'm definitely making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong energy per mole. Maybe each mole of ATP is about 8,000 calories? No, that can't be. Wait, 1 mole is about 7.3 kcal. So 0.014 *7.3 is 0.1022 kcal. But that can't be, because the options start at 75 cal. There's a miscalculation here.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor. Wait, perhaps each mole of ATP is 8,000 calories. That doesn't make sense because that would make the energy way too high. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the energy as 10,000 calories per mole, but that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the energy per mole of high-energy phosphate bonds. Let's think differently. The question says "high-energy phosphate bonds." So perhaps each mole of ATP has 2 high-energy phosphate bonds, and each broken bond releases a certain amount of energy.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: the complete breakdown of ATP to ADP and Pi releases energy from two high-energy bonds. Each of these bonds releases about 7,300 calories per mole. Wait, no, that's not right because that would make the total 14,600 calories per mole of ATP, which is way higher than anything I know.

Wait, no, perhaps each high-energy phosphate bond is about 3,000 calories per mole. So two would be 6,000. But that's still higher than what I thought earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a rounded value of 10,000 calories per mole of ATP. Let me try that.

So 0.014 moles times 10,000 cal/mol gives 140 cal. But that's option B which is 138.2 cal. Hmm, close.

Wait, maybe the exact value is 7,300 calories per mole of ATP. So 0.014 *7,300 would be 102.2 cal, which is near option F:100 cal, but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 8,000 calories per mole. So 0.014 *8,000 = 112 cal, which would be near option G:110 cal.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think if I have the correct approach. The muscle has ATP and phosphocreatine. Each gram has 5e-6 ATP and 30e-6 PCr. So for 400g, it's 400*(5e-6 +30e-6) =400*(35e-6) =14e-3 moles of ATP.

Now, each mole of ATP yields about 7.3 kcal. So 0.014 *7.3 = 0.1022 kcal, but that's way too low. Therefore, I must have messed up the units.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of total moles. Let me recalculate.

Each gram has 5e-6 ATP: that's 5 micromoles per gram. 400 grams would be 400 *5e-6 = 2e-3 moles.

Phosphocreatine is 30e-6 per gram. So 400 *30e-6 = 12e-3 moles. Each of those can be converted to ATP, so 12e-3 more ATP. So total ATP is 14e-3 moles.

14e-3 moles is 0.014 moles.

Now, each mole of ATP gives 7.3 kcal, so 0.014 *7.3 = 0.1022 kcal, which is about 0.1 kcal. But the options start at 75 cal. So this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10 somewhere. Oh wait, 5e-6 is 5 micromoles. 400 grams would be 400 *5 micromoles = 2,000 micromoles, which is 2e-3 moles. Similarly, 30e-6 is 30 micromoles per gram, so 400 grams is 12,000 micromoles, which is 12e-3 moles.

Wait, perhaps the energy per mole is 8,000 calories, but that would give 0.014 *8,000 = 112 cal. Which is option G:110 cal, but it's 112.

Alternatively, maybe the energy is 7,300 calories per mole. So 0.014 *7300 = 102.2 cal, which is about 100 cal, option F.

But wait, another approach: maybe each mole of high-energy phosphate is 10,000 calories. So for each mole of ATP, you get two high-energy bonds, so 2 *10,000? No, that would be 20,000 cal per mole, which is way too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the high-energy phosphate in ATP is 10,000 cal per mole. So each mole of ATP contributes 10,000 cal. Then 0.014 moles would be 140 cal, which is option B:138.2.

Wait, but why would that be? Each mole of ATP gives 7.3 kcal when broken down into ADP. So maybe the question is using a higher value, perhaps 10,000 cal per mole. But that seems off.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm forgetting that phosphocreatine also has high-energy bonds. No, because when PCr breaks down, it's converted into creatine and Pi, and in the process, it donates a phosphate to ADP, making ATP. So each PCr gives one ATP, which can then be broken down. So the total ATP available is the sum of initial ATP and the PCr.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the total high-energy phosphate bonds. Each ATP has two high-energy bonds. Let me think: when you break down ATP to AMP and pyrophosphate, you break two bonds. But in reality, the breakdown to ADP releases one bond, and then ADP to AMP another.

Wait, perhaps the question considers each ATP as providing two high-energy bonds, each worth about 10,000 calories per mole. So each ATP would be 20,000 cal per mole. But that can't be right because that's way higher than the known value.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible options. The calculated 0.014 moles times 7.3 kcal is approximately 0.102 kcal, which is 102 joules, which is way lower than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the multipliers. Let me redo the calculation. 5e-6 mole/g *400g = 2e-3 moles. 30e-6 *400=12e-3. So 14e-3 total ATP. 14e-3 is 0.014 moles.

If each mole of ATP provides about 8,000 cal, then 0.014 *8000=112 cal. That's option G:110 cal. But it's 112, which isn't exactly an option, but close to G.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy per mole is 10,000 cal, so 0.014 *10,000=140 cal. That's option B:138.2.

Wait, but why would the energy be 10,000 cal per mole? I thought it's about 7.3 kcal.

Wait, maybe the question is using the total energy from both ATP and PCr as their own high-energy bonds. Because PCr also has a high-energy bond. So for each PCr, you get another 7.3 kcal when it's broken down. Wait, no, because PCr donates a phosphate to ADP to form ATP, which then can be broken down. So the energy from PCr is realized when that ATP is broken down. So the initial ATP is 5e-6, and the PCr gives another 30e-6 ATP equivalents.

So the total is 35e-6 per gram, which for 400g is 0.014 moles.

Each mole of ATP broken down gives 7.3 kcal, so 0.014 *7.3 = 0.1022 kcal. That can't be, because the options are all higher.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong units. Perhaps the data is in millimoles instead of micromoles. Let me check the question again. It says 5 ×10^-6 mole, which is 5 micromoles.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total energy in a different way. Let me think about the energy per gram. Each gram has 5e-6 moles of ATP and 30e-6 of PCr. So total high-energy phosphate per gram is 35e-6 moles. Each mole gives 7.3 kcal, so per gram, it's 35e-6 *7.3 = 255.5e-6 kcal, which is 0.0002555 kcal per gram. Multiply by 400 grams: 0.0002555 *400 = 0.1022 kcal. Still way too low.

Wait, I'm definitely missing something here. Let me think about the number of moles again. 400 grams × 35e-6 moles/g = 0.014 moles. 0.014 moles × 7.3 kcal/mole = 0.1022 kcal. So about 0.1 kcal, which is 100 J. But the options are all way higher, like 75,90, etc.

So perhaps I've made a mistake in units. Wait, maybe the values are in millimoles, not micromoles. Let me check the question again. The question says 5 ×10^-6 mole is 5 micromole. So that's correct.

Wait, another angle: maybe the energy is calculated per high-energy bond, not per mole of ATP. Each mole of ATP has two bonds, each releasing about 3,400 calories (but that number seems high). Wait, no, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy per mole is 10,000 calories. So 0.014 moles ×10,000 cal/mole = 140 cal. That's option B:138.2. Wait, but why 10,000?

Alternatively, maybe the question considers that each mole of ATP gives 8,000 cal. So 0.014 ×8,000 = 112 cal, which is option G:110. But not exact.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more precisely. Let's take 7.3 kcal per mole.

0.014 moles ×7.3 kcal/mole = ?

Let me compute 0.01 *7.3=0.073, 0.004 *7.3=0.0292. Sum is 0.1022 kcal.

But that's way below the options. So I'm definitely making a mistake here. Maybe the question expects me to sum the ATP and PCr as separate molecules, each contributing their own energy.

Wait, that is, perhaps the ATP's energy plus the PCr's energy. Because PCr also has high-energy bonds.

So each mole of ATP gives 7.3 kcal, and each mole of PCr gives 7.3 kcal as well, because when PCr breaks down, it releases energy to form ATP. So total energy would be ATP plus PCr, both contributing 7.3 kcal per mole.

So for each gram:

ATP:5e-6 ×7.3 = 3.65e-5 kcal.

PCr:30e-6 ×7.3 = 2.19e-4 kcal.

Total per gram: 3.65e-5 + 2.19e-4 = 2.855e-4 kcal.

Multiply by 400 grams: 2.855e-4 ×400 = 0.1142 kcal, which is about 0.114 kcal. Still too low.

This can't be right. Therefore, I must have made a wrong assumption. Maybe I should consider that each high-energy phosphate bond is worth about 10,000 cal, so each mole of ATP (with 2 bonds) would give 20,000 cal. Let's try that.

Then:

ATP per gram:5e-6 mol → each mole has 2 bonds → 5e-6 *2 =1e-5 bonds.

Energy per bond:10,000 cal → 1e-5 moles ×10,000 cal = 1e-1 cal per gram from ATP.

PCr per gram:30e-6 mol → each mole has 1 bond →30e-6 ×1 =3e-5 bonds.

Energy:3e-5 ×10,000 =3e-0 cal per gram.

So per gram, ATP+PCr: 0.1 +3=3.1 cal per gram.

Wait, 0.1 cal/g from ATP and 3 cal/g from PCr? Wait, no, let me compute again.

Wait, each mole of ATP has 2 high-energy bonds, so 5e-6 moles would have 1e-5 moles of bonds. Each bond is 10,000 cal, so 1e-5 *10,000=0.1 cal per gram from ATP.

PCr has one bond per mole, so 30e-6 *1 =3e-5 moles of bonds. Each is 10,000 cal, so 3e-5 *10,000=3 cal per gram.

So per gram, total is 0.1 +3 =3.1 cal.

Multiply by 400 grams:3.1 *400=1,240 cal. That's way higher than any option,
