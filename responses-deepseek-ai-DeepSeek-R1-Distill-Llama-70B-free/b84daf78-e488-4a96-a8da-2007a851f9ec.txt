Question:

In the extreme case, $ 1,000 of new reserves put into a bank will ultimately result in an increase of $ 5,000 of bank de-posits, assuming that the reserve ratio is 20%. But in reality this is rarely the case. What stops the extreme case from being realized?

Options:

A: A decrease in the money supply by the central bank
B: Withdrawals of reserves from the banking system and not adhering to the reserve ratio
C: Low bank deposits
D: Excessive regulation of the banking industry
E: Increase in government borrowing crowding out private lending

Okay, so I've got this economics question here about banking and the money supply. Hmm, I remember that banks have something called a reserve ratio, which is the proportion of deposits they must keep as reserves rather than lending out. The question is about why the extreme case of a $1,000 increase in reserves leading to $5,000 more deposits doesn't usually happen.

Wait, right, the reserve ratio is 20%, so that means banks have to keep 20% of their deposits as reserves. So if a bank gets $1,000 in new reserves, they can lend out 80% of that, which is $800. Then that $800 gets deposited elsewhere, and the next bank can lend out 80% of that, and so on. So in the extreme case, the money supply increases by moreâ€”like $5,000 because 1000/(1-0.8) = 5000. But why doesn't this actually happen fully?

I think in reality, not all the money gets redeposited. Like, people might hold some of it as cash, or maybe the banks don't lend all they can because they're worried about their reserves. Oh, wait, another factor is that when banks make loans, not all the money goes back into the banking system. Some people might use it for transactions, or maybe the recipients don't deposit all of it, so the money doesn't get multiplied as much.

Looking at the options, option B says "Withdrawals of reserves from the banking system and not adhering to the reserve ratio." Hmm, not sure. Wait, if banks don't adhere, maybe they're holding more reserves, but that would actually lead to less lending. Or maybe if they have to withdraw reserves, perhaps the central bank is doing something.

Option A is a decrease in money supply by the central bank. So central banks can do open market operations. If they sell securities, they take money out of circulation. But that's an action that would counteract the expansion, but the question is why the initial $1000 doesn't lead to the full $5000.

Option C is low bank deposits. I don't see how that directly stops the money multiplier. Maybe if deposits are low, the initial reserve addition has a smaller base, but the example starts with $1000, so it's about the process not completing.

Option D is excessive regulation. I'm not sure. Regulations like reserve requirements are in place, but if anything, that's part of the model. So maybe if banks are over-regulated, they can't lend as much, but the question is more about why the process stops in reality.

Option E is increase in government borrowing. If the government borrows more, it can crowd out private borrowing. So banks might have less lending because the government is taking up funds. That could reduce the money multiplier because less lending happens.

Wait, but the question is specifically about what stops the extreme case. So if the extreme case is when the money is fully redeposited each time, but in reality, some of the money is held as cash or used for transactions. So the money isn't redeposited, so the multiplier effect is less.

But the options don't directly mention cash holdings. Let me look again. Option B says "Withdrawals of reserves from the banking system." Oh, maybe if people take cash out, that's a withdrawal, reducing the reserves. So when someone withdraws cash, the bank's reserves go down, so they can't lend as much. So each time the money circulates, some is taken out as cash. That would prevent the full multiplier.

Another thing is that when banks make loans, the borrowed funds might not all be redeposited. Like, if I take a loan and use it to buy something from someone who doesn't bank, or who keeps some cash, that reduces the amount available for the next round of lending.

So looking back, which option covers this? The option B says withdrawals of reserves, so if people are taking cash out, that reduces the bank's reserves, making the multiplier less. So the answer might be B.

Wait, but the question says "what stops the extreme case from being realized?" So the extreme case assumes that all the money is redeposited. So in reality, people don't redeposit all of it. Maybe they hold some as cash or spend it on goods, etc.

Another possibility is that banks might not lend all their excess reserves because they prefer to hold more for precautionary motives. But that's not one of the options here.

So among the options, the closest is probably B. Because when people make withdrawals, it's like taking cash out, which reduces the bank's reserves. So the banks don't have as much to lend, thus the multiplier is limited.

Alternatively, option E: if government borrowing increases, it might reduce the amount that banks can lend to the private sector. But that's more about fiscal policy affecting the money supply. So if the government borrows a lot, it could absorb the liquidity, making banks have less to lend. That could also reduce the multiplier.

But the question is about why the initial $1000 doesn't lead to $5000. So it's more about the process of lending and redepositing. So maybe it's because some of the money is held as cash, which would be a withdrawal in a sense, so option B.

Wait, but the question says "what stops the extreme case from being realized?" So the extreme case is when banks fully utilize their reserves, but in reality, they might not because of factors like cash withdrawals.

So the correct answer is B. Because when reserves are withdrawn, the banks can't lend as much, so the multiplier is less than the theoretical maximum.

The question asks why the extreme case, where $1,000 in new bank reserves leads to a $5,000 increase in deposits, is rarely realized. This extreme case assumes that all funds are redeposited into the banking system and that banks fully utilize their excess reserves for lending. However, in reality, several factors prevent this from happening.

One key reason is that not all funds are redeposited. For example, some individuals may hold cash for transactions or other purposes, reducing the amount available for lending. Additionally, when banks make loans, the borrowed funds might not all be redeposited into the banking system. Instead, some may be used for purchases or held as cash, further limiting the multiplier effect.

Among the options provided, **Option B: Withdrawals of reserves from the banking system and not adhering to the reserve ratio** best explains why the extreme case is not realized. Withdrawals of cash or other forms of reserves reduce the amount of funds banks can lend, thereby limiting the money multiplier. This aligns with the idea that not all funds are redeposited or used for further lending, which is a critical assumption in the extreme case.

Other options, such as **Option E: Increase in government borrowing**, could theoretically reduce lending by crowding out private borrowing. However, this is more about fiscal policy and less about the specific mechanism of why the money multiplier falls short in this scenario.

Thus, the most accurate answer is **Option B**, as it directly addresses the reduction in reserves and the subsequent limitation on lending, which prevents the extreme case from being realized.
