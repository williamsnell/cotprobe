Okay, so I've got this problem here about a perfect gas undergoing isothermal compression. I'm a bit rusty on my gas laws, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says the gas undergoes isothermal compression, which means the temperature stays constant. Oh right, for isothermal processes, the ideal gas law can be simplified using Boyle's Law or the combined gas law. I remember that for isothermal processes, the product of pressure and volume remains constant. So P1 * V1 = P2 * V2, right?

The problem gives me the final pressure (P2) as 5.04 bar and the final volume (V2) as 4.65 dm³. The volume was reduced by 2.20 dm³, so the original volume must have been V1 = V2 + 2.20. Let me calculate that. V2 is 4.65 dm³, adding 2.20 gives V1 = 6.85 dm³. Wait, that makes sense because compression reduces volume, so the initial volume is larger.

Now, using the equation P1 * V1 = P2 * V2. I need to find P1. So rearranging the equation gives P1 = (P2 * V2) / V1.

But wait, I should check the units because the answer needs to be in atm. The given pressure is in bar, so I'll need to convert bar to atm. I remember that 1 bar is approximately 0.9869 atm. Alternatively, 1 atm is about 1.01325 bar, so maybe I should convert P2 from bar to atm before plugging into the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate P1 in bar first and then convert to atm. Let's see. Let me proceed step by step.

First, calculate P2 * V2. P2 is 5.04 bar, V2 is 4.65 dm³. So 5.04 * 4.65 = let's compute that. 5 * 4.65 is 23.25, and 0.04 *4.65 is 0.186. So adding them gives about 23.25 + 0.186 = 23.436 bar·dm³.

Now, divide that by V1, which is 6.85 dm³. So 23.436 / 6.85. Let me compute that. Let's see: 6.85 times 3 is 20.55. Subtract 20.55 from 23.436, which leaves about 2.886. Bring down a zero (since 6.85 goes into 28.86 four times? 6.85*4=27.4, so 4 * 0.1 is 0.4 atm? Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe better to approximate.

Wait, 6.85 times 3.43 is approximately 23.436?

Let me check: 6 * 3.43 = 20.58, 0.85 *3.43 is about 2.9155. Sum is 20.58 +2.9155=23.4955. That's a bit over, so maybe 3.43 is a little high. Let me see, 6.85 * 3.42 = ?

6 *3.42=20.52, 0.85 *3.42 is 2.907. Sum is 23.427. Oh, that's very close to 23.436. So P1 is approximately 3.42 bar.

Wait wait, no, no. Wait, I'm getting P1 as 3.42 bar, but wait no, the calculation was (P2 * V2) / V1. So 23.436 bar·dm³ divided by 6.85 dm³ gives approximately 3.42 bar. So P1 is about 3.42 bar.

But the question asks for the original pressure in atm. So I need to convert 3.42 bar to atm.

Since 1 bar ≈ 0.9869 atm. So 3.42 bar * 0.9869 atm/bar ≈ let's see. 3 * 0.9869 is 2.9607, 0.42 *0.9869 is about 0.415. So adding those gives approximately 3.3757 atm.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B: 3.38 atm. But wait, let me check my calculations again for accuracy. Because I approximated, maybe I should be more precise.

Let me redo the calculation without approximations.

Calculating P2 * V2: 5.04 *4.65.

Let me compute 5 *4.65 =23.25, 0.04 *4.65=0.186. So total is 23.436.

Divide by V1=6.85: 23.436 /6.85.

Let me do the division more accurately.

6.85 times 3 is 20.55. 23.436 -20.55 =2.886.

Bring down a zero (since it's 23.436.0), making it 28.860.

6.85 goes into 28.860 four times: 4 *6.85=27.4. Subtract: 28.86 -27.4=1.46.

Bring down a zero: 14.60.

6.85 goes into 14.60 twice: 2*6.85=13.7. 14.60-13.7=0.90.

Bring down a zero: 9.00.

6.85 goes into 9.00 once: 1*6.85=6.85. Subtract: 9.00-6.85=2.15.

Bring down zero: 21.5.

6.85 *3=20.55. Subtract: 21.5-20.55=0.95.

So now, putting it all together: 3.42 + (0.04 from the first step? Wait, no, let me recount.

Wait, the initial 23.436 /6.85.

Wait, 6.85 * 3.42 is 23.427, which is 23.436-23.427=0.009 less.

So the exact division would be 3.42 + (0.009 /6.85) ≈ 3.42 + 0.0013 ≈3.4213 bar.

So P1 is approximately 3.4213 bar.

Now, converting to atm:

3.4213 bar * 0.9869 atm/bar = ?

Compute 3 *0.9869 = 2.9607.

0.4213 *0.9869: Let me compute 0.4 *0.9869=0.39476, 0.0213*0.9869≈0.02103.

So 0.39476 +0.02103=0.41579.

Total is 2.9607 +0.41579=3.3765 atm.

So approximately 3.3765 atm.

Looking back at the options, option B is 3.38 atm, which is very close. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but let me double-check if I mixed up P1 and P2. Oh no, because in Boyle's Law, P1 V1 = P2 V2. So P1 = (P2 V2)/V1.

Yes, I did that correctly. Because during compression, the volume decreases, so if V2 is smaller than V1, P2 should be higher than P1 if the process is compression. Wait, no. Wait, in isothermal compression, if the volume decreases (V2 < V1), then according to P1 V1 = P2 V2, since V2 is smaller, P2 must be larger than P1. Wait, but in this case, P2 is 5.04 bar, which is higher than P1 in bar. But when converted to atm, since 1 bar is ~0.987 atm, 5.04 bar is about 5.04 *0.987≈4.98 atm. Wait, wait, let me compute that.

Wait, 5.04 bar *0.9869 atm/bar = ?

5 *0.9869 =4.9345, 0.04 *0.9869≈0.0395. Sum is 4.9345 +0.0395≈4.974 atm. So P2 is about 4.974 atm. But in my calculation, P1 is about 3.38 atm. Since the compression leads to higher pressure, that makes sense because P2 is higher than P1. So that's correct.

So the original pressure was 3.38 atm, which is option B.

To solve the problem, we use the fact that the process is isothermal, meaning the product of pressure and volume remains constant: 

\[
P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2
\]

### Step 1: Determine the initial volume
The final volume is given as \( V_2 = 4.65 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \), and the volume is reduced by \( 2.20 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \). Therefore, the initial volume is:

\[
V_1 = V_2 + 2.20 = 4.65 + 2.20 = 6.85 \, \mathrm{dm}^3
\]

### Step 2: Apply Boyle's Law
Rearranging the equation \( P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 \) to solve for \( P_1 \):

\[
P_1 = \frac{P_2 V_2}{V_1}
\]

Substitute the given values \( P_2 = 5.04 \, \mathrm{bar} \), \( V_2 = 4.65 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \), and \( V_1 = 6.85 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \):

\[
P_1 = \frac{5.04 \times 4.65}{6.85}
\]

First, calculate \( 5.04 \times 4.65 \):

\[
5.04 \times 4.65 = 23.436 \, \mathrm{bar} \cdot \mathrm{dm}^3
\]

Now divide by \( 6.85 \):

\[
P_1 = \frac{23.436}{6.85} \approx 3.42 \, \mathrm{bar}
\]

### Step 3: Convert pressure to atm
Since \( 1 \, \mathrm{bar} \approx 0.9869 \, \mathrm{atm} \), convert \( P_1 \) from bar to atm:

\[
P_1 = 3.42 \times 0.9869 \approx 3.38 \, \mathrm{atm}
\]

### Final Answer
The original pressure of the gas is approximately \( 3.38 \, \mathrm{atm} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
