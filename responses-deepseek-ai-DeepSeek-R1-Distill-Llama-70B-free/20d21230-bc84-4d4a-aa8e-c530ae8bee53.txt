Okay, so I have to answer this multiple-choice question with two statements. Let's take each statement one by one.

Statement 1 says, "L2 regularization of linear models tends to make models more sparse than L1 regularization." Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on regularization types. From what I remember, L1 regularization adds a term proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients, which can push some coefficients to zero, making the model sparse. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a term proportional to the square of the coefficients. I think L2 doesn't make the model as sparse because the penalty grows with larger coefficients but doesn't set them exactly to zero. So models with L1 tend to be sparser. That means Statement 1 is false. Because L2 doesn't make models more sparse than L1; it's the other way around.

Statement 2: "Residual connections can be found in ResNets and Transformers." I'm more confident about this. Residual Networks (ResNets) definitely use residual connections; that's a key part of their design to help with training deep networks. As for Transformers, I think they also use residual connections. In the Transformer architecture, after the self-attention layer and the feed-forward network, they add the input to the output, which is a residual connection. So yes, both ResNets and Transformers have residual connections. So Statement 2 is true.

Now, looking at the options. The first part of each option is about Statement 1 being True or False, and the second about Statement 2.

Statement 1 is False. So the options that have the first part as False are A, B, D, F, J.

Statement 2 is True, so the second part must be True. So looking at the options, which have the second part as True: Option B is (False, True), and Option J is (Mostly False, True). Wait, but Statement 1 is definitely False, not Mostly. So Option B is (False, True), which is correct for both statements.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there any nuances? For Statement 1, is there any situation where L2 might lead to sparsity? I think L2 is for preventing large weights but doesn't zero them out. So models aren't sparse. So Statement 1 is definitely False. Statement 2 is definitely True.

So the correct option is B: False, True.

The correct answer is based on evaluating each statement. Statement 1 is false because L2 regularization does not produce sparse models as effectively as L1. Statement 2 is true as both ResNets and Transformers use residual connections.

Answer: B
