Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Sinnott-Armstrong's views on what a government morally ought to do. Hmm, I remember that Sinnott-Armstrong has written about the difference between what the government should do and what individuals should do, especially in the context of moral obligations.

The question is asking about the implications of the government having a moral obligation. The options are A through D. Let me think this through.

I think Sinnott-Armstrong argues that just because the government morally ought to do something, it doesn't automatically mean that individuals, like the citizens, have the same moral obligation. For example, if the government should provide aid, it doesn't necessarily mean each citizen should provide that aid individually. So, the government's duty is a collective one, and individuals might not have the same responsibility.

Looking at the options:

Option A says that the fact doesn't prove government officials should promote it. Wait, that doesn't sound right. If the government morally ought to do something, then officials, as part of the government, probably should promote it.

Option B says the fact doesn't prove that you (as an individual) ought to do it. Oh, that makes sense. Because the government's obligation is separate from individual obligations. So even if the government should act, it doesn't directly mean the individual should.

Options C and D suggest that it proves you shouldn't or should do it, respectively. But I think the main point is that the government's obligation doesn't transfer directly to individuals, so C is probably incorrect. D would be the opposite, saying you should do it, which isn't necessarily true.

So the correct answer is B. The fact that the government morally ought to do something doesn't prove that you as an individual ought to do it. It's about the distinction between collective and individual moral obligations.

The question concerns Sinnott-Armstrong's view on the relationship between a government's moral obligations and those of individuals. Sinnott-Armstrong argues that the moral obligations of a government (a collective entity) do not automatically translate to moral obligations for individuals. For instance, if a government morally ought to provide aid, this does not necessarily mean that every citizen is morally required to provide aid individually. The key distinction lies between collective and individual moral responsibilities.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** suggests that the fact does not prove government officials should promote it. This is incorrect because if the government morally ought to do something, officials, as part of the government, are likely obligated to promote it.
  
- **Option B** states that the fact does not prove that you (as an individual) ought to do it. This aligns with Sinnott-Armstrong's argument, as the government's moral obligation does not directly impose a moral duty on individuals.

- **Option C** claims that the fact proves you ought not to do it, which is incorrect because the government's obligation does not imply that individuals are forbidden from acting.

- **Option D** asserts that the fact proves you ought to do it, which is also incorrect because the government's moral obligation does not automatically impose a moral duty on individuals.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**, as it reflects the distinction between collective and individual moral obligations.

Answer: B
