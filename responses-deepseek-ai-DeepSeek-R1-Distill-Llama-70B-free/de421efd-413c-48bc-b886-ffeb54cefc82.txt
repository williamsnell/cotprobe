Okay, so I've got this question about car insurance, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully again.

The situation is that Mr. Winter's car was overturned during a riot, causing $346.50 in damage. He has a $50 deductible collision insurance, but no comprehensive coverage. The question is, how much will the insurance company pay him?

Hmm, I remember that car insurance has different types of coverage. There's collision and comprehensive. Collision typically covers damages when your car collides with another vehicle or object, right? Comprehensive covers other things like theft, vandalism, natural disasters, or maybe even riots?

Wait, the question says he has collision insurance with a $50 deductible. But he doesn't have comprehensive. So, when his car was overturned in a riot, what kind of coverage would that fall under?

I think a riot might be considered an act of vandalism or something that's not a collision. So maybe it's under comprehensive. Oh, but he doesn't have comprehensive coverage. So does that mean the insurance company won't cover it?

Wait, but wait. Collision insurance covers damage caused by collisions, like if he crashes into something. But a riot causing the car to overturnâ€”does that count as a collision? Or is it something else?

Alternatively, maybe the riot is considered an act of civil unrest, which is more like vandalism. Vandalism is usually covered under comprehensive insurance. Since he doesn't have comprehensive, maybe the insurance won't pay anything.

Let me think again. Collision insurance is for when your car hits or is hit by something, like another car, a tree, etc. Comprehensive covers non-collision events, like fire, theft, broken windshield, or vandalism. So a riot would likely be considered vandalism, which is comprehensive.

Since Mr. Winter only has collision and no comprehensive, the insurance company won't cover the damages from the riot. So they won't pay anything.

Looking at the options, option E says "not pay him anything." That must be the correct answer.

The insurance company will not pay Mr. Winter anything because the damage from the riot falls under comprehensive coverage, which he does not have. 

Answer: E
