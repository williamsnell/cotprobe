Okay, so I have this question about Chinese divination methods, and I'm a bit new to this topic. Let me see what I can figure out. The question is asking about a specific method where they examine fired animal bones to divine the future. Hmm, I remember hearing about something like this before, maybe in a history class or something.

I think it's related to ancient China. Oh right, I think it's called something like "oracle bones." But wait, the options don't have "oracle bones" as an option. Let me look at the choices again.

The options are A through H. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Hang-t'u. I'm not sure what that is. It doesn't ring a bell immediately.

Option B: Scapulimancy. Scapula is the shoulder blade, right? So scapulimancy would be divination using shoulder blades. I think that's a real method. Maybe this is it because the question mentions animal bones, and shoulder blades are bones. So this could be a possibility.

Option C: I Ching. I know that the I Ching is the Book of Changes, a classic Chinese text used for divination, but I think it uses coins or yarrow sticks, not animal bones. So probably not the answer here.

Option D: Geomancy. That sounds like it's related to earth or geography. I'm pretty sure geomancy involves interpreting natural features or earth signs, not animal bones. So probably not D.

Option E: Kau Cim. I'm not too familiar, but I think Kau Cim is a Chinese divination method involving bamboo sticks. So maybe not related to bones.

Option F: Cylinder seal prophecy. Cylinder seals are more associated with Mesopotamia, like for making impressions on clay tablets. Doesn't sound like it's about bones.

Option G: Tung Shing. I'm not sure. Maybe another form of divination, but I don't recall it involving animal bones.

Option H: Sarsen divination. Sarsens are a type of sandstone, I think, used in stone circles like Stonehenge. So that's probably not it.

So narrowing it down, the main contenders are B: scapulimancy and possibly A: hang-t'u. Wait, I'm trying to remember. I think scapulimancy is indeed the term for divination using animal shoulder blades, which were heated, and the cracks were interpreted. And in Chinese culture, this was a common practice, especially during the Shang Dynasty. So I think B is the answer.

But wait, the question refers to the process by its Chinese name. Scapulimancy is more the general term, right? The Chinese term might be something else. Oh, wait, I think the actual Chinese term is "ji gu" or something similar, but it's not in the options. Let me think again.

Wait, the question is asking for the Chinese process, so the term should be the Chinese name. The options are a mix of terms. Scapulimancy would be the method but in a general sense, not the specific Chinese name. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is scapulimancy, which is the practice, and option A is Hang-t'u. I'm not sure what Hang-t'u refers to. Maybe Hang-t'u is a term for this practice. Alternatively, I'm mixing up the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, as scapulimancy is the method, regardless of the culture. So if the question is asking for the process, the answer would be scapulimancy. But I'm a bit uncertain because I thought the Chinese called it something else.

Wait, I think the Chinese term for oracle bones is "ji gu," and the practice is called "ji gu" as well. But that's not among the options. So the closest would be scapulimancy, which is the method of using shoulder blades for divination.

So I think the answer is B: scapulimancy.

The question asks about the Chinese process of divining the future by examining fired animal bones. The key is identifying the correct term for this practice. 

- **Option A: Hang-t'u** is unfamiliar and does not directly relate to the described method.  
- **Option B: Scapulimancy** refers to divination using animal shoulder blades, which aligns with the question, as it involves interpreting cracks in fired bones.  
- **Option C: I Ching** is a Chinese text used for divination but involves coins or yarrow sticks, not animal bones.  
- **Option D: Geomancy** relates to earth-based divination, not bones.  
- **Option E: Kau Cim** involves bamboo sticks, not bones.  
- **Option F: Cylinder seal prophecy** is associated with Mesopotamian practices, not Chinese bone divination.  
- **Option G: Tung Shing** is another form of divination but not linked to animal bones.  
- **Option H: Sarsen divination** involves stones, not bones.  

While the Chinese term for this practice is "ji gu," the closest match among the options is **scapulimancy**, which describes the method of using animal bones for divination. Therefore, the answer is:

B
