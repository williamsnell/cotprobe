Question:

Ann, Bea, and Carla were three friends who lived in the same neighborhood. While Ann was away on a business trip, someone broke into her garage and stole her golf clubs. The next week, Ann was planning to go on vacation and asked Bea if she could borrow her golf clubs. Bea agreed and loaned her golf clubs to Ann, who promised to return them after her vacation. When Ann returned home, she kept the golf clubs and continued to use them. A few weeks later, Bea was having dinner with Carla and learned that Carla owed Ann $4,000. Carla had just been laid off from her job and did not have the money to repay Ann. Bea told Carla that she would contact Ann and make arrangements to repay the loan on her behalf. Thereupon, Ann and Bea entered into a written agreement wherein Bea promised to pay Ann, at a rate of $400 a month, the matured $4,000 debt that Carla owed Ann. In the same written instrument, Ann promised to return Bea's golf clubs, which she still had in her possession. Ann, however, made no written or oral. commitment to forbear to sue Carla to collect the $4,000 debt; and Bea made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. After this agreement between Ann and Bea was signed and executed, Ann promptly returned the golf clubs to Bea. For the next six months, Bea made and Ann accepted the $400 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, Ann, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against Carla. However, Bea then repudiated her agreement with Ann, and 30 days later Ann filed a contract action against Bea. Assume that the applicable statute of limitations on Ann's antecedent claim against Carla expired the day before Ann filed her contract action against Bea. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that Bea is not liable to Ann under the terms of their written agreement?

Options:

A: Since the agreement did not specify the consequences if Bea failed to make the payments, Bea is not liable to Ann.
B: Since Bea had already begun making payments to Ann, there was no valid contract between them.
C: Since the written agreement between Bea and Ann shows a gross imbalance between the values of the promises exchanged, the consideration for Bea's promise was legally insufficient to support it.
D: Since Carla, when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, had a pre-existing duty to repay the $4,000 debt to Ann, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann.
E: Since Ann did not expressly promise to forbear to sue Carla to collect the antecedent $4,000 debt, Ann's forbearance for six months could not constitute consideration for Bea's promise.
F: Since Ann did not take any legal action against Carla, Bea's promise to repay the debt was unnecessary and thus lacks consideration.
G: Since Ann returned Bea's golf clubs before the agreement was signed, Bea's promise to repay the $4,000 debt lacks consideration.
H: Since Bea had made no oral or written request for Ann's forbearance, Bea's promise to repay the debt lacks consideration.
I: Since Ann had a pre-existing duty to return Bea's golf clubs to her when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann.
J: Since the statute of limitations on Ann's claim against Carla had expired, Bea's promise to repay the debt is not enforceable.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario involves three friends: Ann, Bea, and Carla. Ann's golf clubs were stolen while she was away. The next week, she borrows Bea's clubs and promises to return them after her vacation. But Ann keeps them and uses them. Later, Bea finds out that Carla owes Ann $4,000, but Carla can't pay because she lost her job. Bea offers to repay the debt on Carla's behalf, and they make a written agreement where Bea will pay Ann $400 a month for the $4,000 debt. In the same agreement, Ann promises to return Bea's golf clubs, which she still has. 

After signing, Ann returns the clubs, and Bea makes payments for six months. Then Bea stops paying, and Ann sues her. The key point is that the statute of limitations on Ann's claim against Carla expired the day before Ann sued Bea.

The question is asking which argument best shows Bea isn't liable under their agreement. The options are A to J, each presenting a different legal argument.

I remember that for a contract to be valid, there needs to be consideration. Consideration is something of value that each party gives to the other. Without it, the promise isn't enforceable.

Looking at the agreement, Bea promises to pay $4,000, and Ann promises to return the golf clubs. But wait, Ann had already borrowed the clubs and was supposed to return them. So when she agreed to return them as part of this new deal, is that a valid consideration?

I think about pre-existing duties. If someone does something they're already supposed to do, that doesn't count as consideration. So Ann returning the clubs might not be sufficient because she was already obligated to return them. That would mean there's no consideration for Bea's promise to pay the debt.

Looking at the options, option I says: "Since Ann had a pre-existing duty to return Bea's golf clubs to her when the agreement was made, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann." That fits because Ann was already supposed to return the clubs, so her promise to do so isn't new consideration.

Another point is the debt. Carla owed Ann $4,000, and Bea agreed to pay it. But if Carla's debt was still valid, then Bea's promise would be a separate contract. However, the consideration from Ann's side is questionable. She didn't promise to forbear suing Carla; she just did it without a promise. So Ann's forbearance wasn't part of the agreement, which might mean there's no consideration from her side.

Option E says that since Ann didn't expressly promise to forbear, her forbearance can't be consideration. But in the agreement, Ann didn't promise that; she just returned the clubs. So maybe that's another angle, but I think the main issue is the pre-existing duty regarding the clubs.

So I think the best argument is option I because Ann was already required to return the clubs, so there's no new consideration for Bea's promise. Without consideration, the contract isn't enforceable, so Bea isn't liable.

The most persuasive argument that Bea is not liable to Ann under the terms of their written agreement is that Ann had a pre-existing duty to return Bea's golf clubs. Since Ann was already obligated to return the clubs, her promise to do so in the agreement does not constitute valid consideration for Bea's promise to pay the $4,000 debt. Without new consideration from Ann, the contract lacks the necessary legal foundation to be enforceable.
