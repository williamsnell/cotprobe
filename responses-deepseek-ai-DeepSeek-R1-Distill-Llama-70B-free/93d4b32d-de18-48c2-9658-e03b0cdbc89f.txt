Okay, so I've got this problem here about desks arranged in a row. There are 7 desks, right? And I need to figure out how many seats to the left of Tonya Kim is sitting. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

First, let me visualize the row. There are 7 desks in a line. Let's number them from 1 to 7 for clarity. So desk 1 is the first on the left, and desk 7 is the last on the right.

Now, the first piece of information is that Hector sits two seats to the right of Kim. So if Kim is sitting at desk number K, then Hector would be at K + 2. Because each seat to the right increases the desk number by one.

Then, Tonya sits three seats to the right of Hector. So if Hector is at H, then Tonya is at H + 3. Substituting the previous info, since H is K + 2, Tonya would be at (K + 2) + 3, which is K + 5.

Wait, let me write that out to make sure. Let me assign variables:
- Kim's seat: K
- Hector's seat: H = K + 2
- Tonya's seat: T = H + 3 = (K + 2) + 3 = K + 5

So Tonya is 5 seats to the right of Kim. But the question is asking how many seats to the left of Tonya Kim sits. So if Tonya is at seat T, Kim is at T - (T - K) seats to the left. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

Another way: the distance between Kim and Tonya is 5 seats. So if I'm looking from Tonya's position, Kim is 5 seats to the left. Because if you're at position T, then K is T - 5. So the number of seats to the left would be 5.

Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me assign actual numbers to test.

Let's say Kim is at desk 1. Then Hector would be at 3 (1+2). Tonya would be at 3+3=6. So Kim is at 1, Tonya at 6. How many seats to the left of Tonya is Kim? Well, 6-1=5 seats apart. So Kim is 5 seats to the left of Tonya.

Another example: if Kim is at 2. Then Hector is at 4. Tonya at 7. So Kim is at 2, Tonya at 7. The difference is 5 again. So yes, Kim is 5 seats to the left of Tonya.

Wait, but the options are given, and option I is 5. So the answer should be I?

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's try when Kim is at 3. Then Hector is at 5, Tonya at 8. Oh wait, but there are only 7 desks. So Tonya can't be at 8. So in that case, Kim must be at a position such that Tonya doesn't go beyond 7.

So the maximum Kim can be at is position 2. Because if Kim is at 2, Hector is at 4, and Tonya is at 7, which is the last desk.

So in all valid scenarios, the number of seats between Kim and Tonya is 5. So the answer should be 5 seats to the left.

Looking back at the options, option I is 5. So the correct answer is I.

To solve the problem, we start by assigning variables to each person's seat:

- Let Kim's seat be \( K \).
- Hector sits 2 seats to the right of Kim, so Hector's seat is \( H = K + 2 \).
- Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector, so Tonya's seat is \( T = H + 3 = (K + 2) + 3 = K + 5 \).

This means Tonya is 5 seats to the right of Kim. Since the question asks how many seats to the left of Tonya Kim sits, the answer is the same as the distance between them, which is 5 seats.

To verify, consider specific examples:
- If Kim is at seat 1, Hector is at seat 3, and Tonya is at seat 6. Kim is 5 seats to the left of Tonya.
- If Kim is at seat 2, Hector is at seat 4, and Tonya is at seat 7. Again, Kim is 5 seats to the left of Tonya.

Thus, the correct answer is 5 seats to the left of Tonya.

The answer is I.
