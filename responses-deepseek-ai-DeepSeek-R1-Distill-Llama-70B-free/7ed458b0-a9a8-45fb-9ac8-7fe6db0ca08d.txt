Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an automobile accelerating, and I'm trying to figure out how far it travels during the acceleration. Hmm, let's see. The car starts at 30 mi/hr and goes up to 60 mi/hr in 10 seconds. I remember that acceleration problems often involve using kinematic equations. 

Wait, but the units here are in miles per hour and seconds, which are a mix. I think I should convert everything to consistent units. Maybe to feet and seconds because the answer options are in feet. I remember that 1 mile is 5280 feet and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. 

So, first, I need to convert the initial and final speeds from mi/hr to ft/s. Let's calculate each one. 

Starting with 30 mi/hr. To convert to ft/s, I multiply by 5280/3600. So, 30 * (5280/3600). Let me compute that. 5280 divided by 3600 is 1.4667 approximately. So 30 * 1.4667 equals... 30 times 1 is 30, 30 times 0.4667 is about 14. So total is around 44 ft/s. Wait, let me do it more accurately. 5280/3600 = 22/15 = 1.466666... So 30 * (22/15) = (30/15)*22 = 2 *22 = 44 ft/s. Oh, right, that's easier. So initial velocity u is 44 ft/s.

Then the final velocity is 60 mi/hr. Using the same conversion: 60 * (22/15) = (60/15)*22 = 4 *22 = 88 ft/s. So v is 88 ft/s.

The time taken for this acceleration is 10 seconds.

Now, I need to find the distance traveled during acceleration. I think the equation that can be used here is the one that relates distance without needing to find acceleration first. The equation is: s = (u + v)/2 * t. Because when acceleration is uniform, the average velocity is the average of initial and final velocities.

So plugging the numbers in: u is 44, v is 88, so their average is (44 +88)/2 = 132/2 = 66 ft/s. Multiply by time t=10 s: 66 *10 = 660 ft. 

Wait, but let me double-check the units. Oh wait, I converted mi/hr to ft/s correctly, so the calculation is right. So the distance should be 660 feet. Looking at the options, option E is 660 ft, so that's the answer. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I mix up which formula to use. Alternatively, the formula s = ut + 0.5 a t² could be used, but that requires knowing the acceleration. But since I don't have a, maybe it's easier to use the average velocity method. 

Wait, another approach: What's the acceleration here? Maybe I can check that way. The acceleration a is (v - u)/t. So (88-44)/10 = 44/10 = 4.4 ft/s². Then, using s = ut + 0.5 a t². u is 44, t is 10. So s = 44*10 + 0.5 *4.4 *10². 

Calculating each part: 44*10 is 440. 0.5 *4.4 is 2.2. 10 squared is 100, so 2.2*100=220. So total s=440+220=660 ft. Yep, same answer. So I'm confident now that E is correct.

To determine how far the automobile travels during the acceleration, we start by converting the speeds from miles per hour (mi/hr) to feet per second (ft/s). Using the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{mi/hr} = \frac{5280}{3600} = 1.4667 \, \text{ft/s}\):

- Initial velocity: \(u = 30 \, \text{mi/hr} = 30 \times 1.4667 = 44 \, \text{ft/s}\),
- Final velocity: \(v = 60 \, \text{mi/hr} = 60 \times 1.4667 = 88 \, \text{ft/s}\).

The time of acceleration is \(t = 10 \, \text{s}\). The distance traveled during uniform acceleration can be calculated using the formula:

\[
s = \frac{(u + v)}{2} \cdot t
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
s = \frac{(44 + 88)}{2} \cdot 10 = 66 \cdot 10 = 660 \, \text{ft}.
\]

Thus, the automobile travels **660 feet** during the acceleration. This matches option **E**.
