Question:

On June 1, an appliance manufacturer telephoned a supplier to determine whether the supplier could provide 300 washing machine motors of a particular model by October 1. The supplier offered to do so at a price of $300 per motor (a total price of $90,000). The manufacturer's representative said, "Deal." The next day the manufacturer's representative sent the supplier an unsigned note on company letterhead that stated, "I am happy that you are going to supply us with the motors. I will call you soon to talk about another order." The manufacturer then sent catalogs to its regular customers advertising washing machines that included the specified motors. The manufacturer did not hear from the supplier until July 1, when the supplier called to say that it would be unable to supply the motors because it was no longer carrying that model. At that time, the manufacturer had received no orders for the machines with the specified motors. The manufacturer sued the supplier for breach of contract, and the supplier raised the statute of frauds as a defense. Is the supplier's statute of frauds defense likely to succeed?

Options:

A: Yes, because the manufacturer had not received any orders for the machines with the specified motors at the time of the supplier's refusal.
B: No, because the manufacturer's representative verbally agreed to the deal over the phone.
C: No, because the supplier failed to object to the contents of the note sent by the manufacturer.
D: Yes, because the supplier was no longer carrying the model of the motor at the time of the call.
E: Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract.
F: Yes, because the manufacturer's note failed to contain a signature.
G: No, because the manufacturer's representative sent the note on company letterhead.
H: No, because the supplier did not inform the manufacturer about not being able to supply the motors in time.
I: Yes, because the supplier never agreed to the contract in writing.
J: No, because the manufacturer distributed the catalogs in reliance on the contract, making the contract enforceable under the statute of frauds.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law and the statute of frauds. Hmm, I remember that the statute of frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is about a manufacturer and a supplier. On June 1, the manufacturer called the supplier to see if they could provide 300 washing machine motors by October 1. The supplier agreed at $300 each, so that's a total of $90,000. The manufacturer's rep said, "Deal." Then the next day, the manufacturer sent an unsigned note on company letterhead. The note said they were happy about the motors and would call soon about another order. 

After that, the manufacturer sent catalogs to customers advertising washing machines with those motors. But they didn't hear back from the supplier until July 1, when the supplier said they couldn't provide the motors because they weren't carrying that model anymore. At that point, the manufacturer hadn't received any orders yet. So the manufacturer sued for breach, and the supplier is using the statute of frauds as a defense.

I need to figure out if the supplier's defense will work. The options are A to J.

First, what's the statute of frauds requirement here? Contracts for the sale of goods over $500 must be in writing to be enforceable under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), right? So this is a sale of goods—300 motors at $300 each, so $90,000 total. That definitely exceeds $500, so the statute of frauds applies.

The question is whether there's a sufficient written memorandum. The manufacturer sent a note, but it was unsigned. The note said they were happy about the motors and would call about another order. Does this note count as a written memorandum under the statute of frauds?

Under the UCC, a written memorandum needs to show that a contract was made. It doesn't have to be signed by both parties, but it does need some indication of agreement. The note here was from the manufacturer, and it mentions that they're going to supply the motors, but it's unsigned. Also, does it include the quantity term? The quantity was 300 motors, which was discussed on the phone. The note doesn't specify that, I think.

So, the unsigned note from the manufacturer—does that satisfy the writing requirement? I remember that under the UCC, the writing must be between the parties, but it doesn't have to be a formal contract. It can be an invoice, a letter, etc. But it needs to include the essential terms, like quantity.

Wait, in this case, the note doesn't mention the quantity. The quantity was 300 motors. So the note just says they're happy about the motors, but doesn't specify the number or the price. So without the quantity term in the writing, does that make the writing insufficient?

Alternatively, maybe the note plus the prior oral agreement could be enough. But no, the writing must contain the essential terms. If the note doesn't have the quantity, then it's insufficient. So the contract wouldn't satisfy the statute of frauds because the writing lacks the quantity term.

Looking at the options, option E says, "Yes, because there is no writing that contains the quantity term of the contract." That sounds right. Because without the quantity in the writing, the statute of frauds isn't satisfied.

Other options: Option F says the note failed to contain a signature. But under UCC, a memorandum doesn't need to be signed by both parties, only that it's written in a way that indicates a contract. So F is incorrect because the absence of a signature isn't the issue here.

Option I says the supplier never agreed in writing, but the note was from the manufacturer. However, the issue is whether the writing includes all the necessary terms, not just mutual agreement.

Option E seems to be the correct reason why the defense would succeed. So the answer is E.
</think>

The statute of frauds under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) requires contracts for the sale of goods over $500 to be in writing. In this case, the contract involves the sale of 300 motors at $300 each, totaling $90,000, which exceeds the $500 threshold. The manufacturer sent an unsigned note to the supplier, but this note did not include the quantity term (300 motors), an essential term of the contract. Without the quantity term in the writing, the statute of frauds is not satisfied. Therefore, the supplier's defense based on the statute of frauds is likely to succeed because the writing lacks the required quantity term.

The correct answer is E. 

Answer: E
