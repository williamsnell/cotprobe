Question:

A state trooper was convicted in federal court in 2008 of taking bribes. He was sentenced to probation. He had served as a state trooper since 1978, and in 1998, he became fully qualified for his pension upon retirement. In 2006, the trooper retired and immediately started receiving monthly state pension checks. In 2009, the governor of the state signed into law a statute, which provided in part:"Section 8. Any member of the state law enforcement staff. . . who is convicted of. . . briberyshall not be entitled to receive any retirement or other benefit or payment of any kind from the stateSuch conviction shall be considered a breach of the staff member's employment contractSection 12. The provisions of this Act shall be retroactive to December 31, 1975. Section 14. This Act shall take effect immediately. "Following the enactment of the statute, the state trooper received a letter from the state which stated that pursuant to the statute, the state is immediately discontinuing pension benefit payments to you on account of your 2008 bribery conviction. "The trooper contacted an attorney, who challenged the discontinuance of benefits on the grounds that the new law was unconstitutional. Assume that the state's highest court holds the statute constitutional. The trooper might still be able to eventually have his pension reinstated if

Options:

A: he can prove that the bribe was unrelated to his duties as a state trooper.
B: he can show that he was convicted before the effective date of thestatute.
C: he can prove that the statute is being applied selectively and discriminately.
D: he can show that the discontinuance of benefits is a form of double jeopardy.
E: he receives a presidential pardon for his bribery offense.
F: he can demonstrate that the statute unfairly targets retired law enforcement officials.
G: he can demonstrate that his conviction was overturned on appeal.
H: he exercises his constitutional right to discretionary review in the U. S. Supreme Court.
I: he can show that the statute violates the dormant commerce clause.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a state trooper who had his pension revoked because of a bribery conviction. The question is about whether he can get his pension back, even if the state's highest court says the statute is constitutional. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, the facts: The trooper was convicted in 2008 of taking bribes and got probation. He had been a trooper since 1978 and became fully eligible for his pension in 1998. He retired in 2006 and started getting pension checks. Then, in 2009, a new law was enacted that says anyone in law enforcement convicted of bribery can't receive any retirement benefits. The law is retroactive to 1975, so it applies to past convictions too. The state stopped his payments, and he's challenging it.

The attorney is arguing the law is unconstitutional, but the state's highest court upheld it. So, the question is, under what circumstances can he still get his pension back?

Looking at the options:

A: Prove the bribe was unrelated to his duties. I'm not sure if that matters because the law seems to apply regardless of the nature of the bribe. It's about being convicted, not about the specifics.

B: Show he was convicted before the statute's effective date. Wait, the statute is retroactive to 1975, so even if he was convicted in 2008, which is before 2009 when the law passed, the retroactivity might cover it. But the question is about the effective date, which is when the law took effect. If the law is applied retroactively, then his prior conviction would be covered. So maybe this isn't a viable option because the law is retroactive.

C: Prove selective application. That's about equal protection or due process if the law is applied unfairly to him compared to others. But the question assumes the highest court upheld the statute as constitutional, so unless there's selective enforcement, which is a different issue. But the question is about the statute being constitutional, not about how it's applied. So maybe this could work if he can show it's being applied discriminatorily, but the question says the court found the statute constitutional, so perhaps this isn't the answer.

D: Double jeopardy. Double jeopardy is about being tried twice for the same offense. Here, the issue is about losing a pension, which is more like a civil penalty. I think the Supreme Court has held that losing a pension based on conviction isn't double jeopardy because it's a civil consequence, not criminal punishment. So this might not work.

E: Presidential pardon. A pardon would forgive the offense, but does it automatically reinstate benefits? I'm not sure. If the pardon erases the conviction, then under the statute, which relies on the conviction, maybe the state would have to start payments again. But I'm not certain about the legal effect of a pardon on such statutes.

F: Unfairly targets retirees. If the statute targets retired officials specifically, maybe it's a bill of attainder or violates some other constitutional principle. But the question says the state court upheld the statute, so that argument might have been considered and rejected. So this might not be a winning argument.

G: Conviction overturned on appeal. If his conviction is overturned, then the basis for stopping the pension is gone. The statute is based on the conviction, so without it, the state would have to reinstate the pension. This seems like a solid option because it directly removes the reason for the penalty.

H: Exercises right to discretionary review in the US Supreme Court. The question states that the state's highest court has already ruled, so if he wants to go to the US Supreme Court, it's possible, but the question is about what might allow him to have the pension reinstated. However, the question assumes the state court upheld it, and the US Supreme Court might not take the case, so this isn't a guarantee.

I: Dormant commerce clause violation. That's about interstate commerce, which doesn't seem directly relevant here since it's a state pension law affecting a state employee. So probably not applicable.

Wait, the question is about what might still allow him to get his pension back, even if the statute is constitutional. So, if the statute is upheld, then any constitutional challenges based on the statute's provisions would fail. But if his conviction is overturned, then the predicate for the statute's application is gone. So the state would no longer have a basis to stop the pension, regardless of the statute's constitutionality.

So the answer would be G. Because if his conviction is overturned, the reason for stopping the pension is removed, so the pension would have to be reinstated.

The question revolves around a state trooper whose pension was revoked due to a bribery conviction, with the revocation based on a retroactive statute upheld as constitutional by the state's highest court. The trooper seeks to have his pension reinstated, and the analysis focuses on identifying the most plausible argument to achieve this outcome.

- **Option A**: The nature of the bribe being unrelated to duties is unlikely to matter, as the statute applies to any bribery conviction, regardless of context.
- **Option B**: The statute's retroactivity to 1975 means it applies to the trooper's 2008 conviction, so challenging based on the effective date would likely fail.
- **Option C**: While selective application could raise equal protection concerns, the statute's constitutionality has already been upheld, making this less viable.
- **Option D**: Double jeopardy does not apply here, as the revocation of benefits is a civil consequence, not criminal punishment.
- **Option E**: A presidential pardon might erase the conviction, potentially reinstating benefits, but the legal effect of a pardon on such statutes is uncertain.
- **Option F**: The statute targeting retirees was likely considered in the state court's ruling, which upheld the law, so this argument is unlikely to succeed.
- **Option G**: If the trooper's conviction is overturned, the basis for revoking the pension disappears, making this the most direct and plausible path to reinstatement.
- **Option H**: While discretionary review in the U.S. Supreme Court is possible, it is not guaranteed and does not directly address reinstatement.
- **Option I**: The dormant commerce clause is irrelevant here, as the case involves state pension laws and not interstate commerce.

The strongest argument is **Option G**, as overturning the conviction would remove the statutory basis for revoking the pension, leading to its reinstatement regardless of the statute's constitutionality.
