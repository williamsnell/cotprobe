Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: In triangle RST, point X is on side RS, Y is on RT, and Z is on ST. XY and XZ are midsegments of triangle RST. The length of XY is 7, RT is 13, and the measure of angle YXZ is 124 degrees. I need to find the length of ST.

Hmm, midsegments in a triangle... I remember that a midsegment is a segment that connects the midpoints of two sides of a triangle. And the important thing about midsegments is that they're parallel to the third side and half as long as that side. So, if XY is a midsegment, it should be parallel to ST and half its length. Wait, but XY's length is 7, so that would make ST 14? That seems straightforward, but let me think again.

Wait, but the problem also mentions XZ is a midsegment. So, X is on RS, Y is on RT, and Z is on ST. So, XY connects RS to RT, meaning it's a midsegment between RS and RT. Wait, no, I might be getting confused. Let me clarify.

Midsegments connect midpoints. So, if XY is a midsegment, then X and Y must be midpoints of RS and RT, respectively. Similarly, if XZ is a midsegment, then X and Z must be midpoints of RS and ST, respectively. So, that means X is the midpoint of RS, Y is the midpoint of RT, and Z is the midpoint of ST.

Wait, but X is on RS, Y on RT, Z on ST. So, if XY is a midsegment, then it's connecting midpoints of RS and RT, so XY is parallel to ST and half its length. Similarly, XZ connects midpoints of RS and ST, so XZ is parallel to RT and half its length.

So, XY = (1/2) ST, so ST would be 2 * XY. XY is 7, so ST would be 14. That would make option I:14 the correct answer. But wait, there's more information given. The length of RT is 13, and angle YXZ is 124 degrees. So, why is that information provided? Because if ST is simply 14, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps this is not just a straightforward midsegment problem because of the angle given. Maybe I need to use the Law of Cosines or something here.

Let me try to visualize the triangle RST and the points X, Y, Z. Let's denote the midpoints:

- X is the midpoint of RS.
- Y is the midpoint of RT.
- Z is the midpoint of ST.

So, triangle RST has midsegments XY and XZ. So, XY connects X (mid RS) to Y (mid RT), making XY parallel to ST and half its length. Similarly, XZ connects X (mid RS) to Z (mid ST), making XZ parallel to RT and half its length.

So, in triangle YXZ, we have sides XY and XZ, and the angle between them, YXZ, is 124 degrees.

Wait, so XY is 7, which is half of ST. So, ST would be 14. But let me check if I can confirm this using the other information.

Wait, but if XZ is a midsegment, then XZ is half of RT. RT is 13, so XZ should be 13/2 = 6.5.

So in triangle YXZ, XY is 7, XZ is 6.5, and the angle between them is 124 degrees. So, perhaps I can compute YZ using the Law of Cosines and see if it relates to something else.

Wait, but YZ is another midsegment. Or maybe it's not. Let me think. Y is the midpoint of RT, and Z is the midpoint of ST. So, YZ would be a midsegment connecting midpoints of RT and ST. Therefore, YZ should be parallel to RS and half its length.

But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. Maybe I should focus on triangle YXZ. Let's compute YZ using Law of Cosines.

In triangle YXZ:

- XY =7
- XZ=6.5
- angle YXZ=124 degrees

So, YZ² = XY² + XZ² - 2 * XY * XZ * cos(angle YXZ)

YZ² = 7² + 6.5² - 2*7*6.5*cos(124°)

Let me compute this:

7²=49
6.5²=42.25
2*7*6.5=91

cos(124°) is negative because 124 is in the second quadrant. Let me compute it numerically.

cos(124°) ≈ cos(180-56) = -cos(56°) ≈ -0.5592

So,

YZ² = 49 + 42.25 - 91*(-0.5592)
= 91.25 + (91 * 0.5592)
Compute 91 * 0.5592:

Let me compute 90 * 0.5592 = 50.328, plus 1*0.5592=0.5592 → total 50.8872

So, YZ² ≈ 91.25 +50.8872 = 142.1372 → YZ ≈ sqrt(142.1372) ≈ 11.926, which is approximately 11.93.

Hmm, so YZ is about 11.93. Now, since YZ is a midsegment parallel to RS and half its length, then RS should be approximately 2*11.93 ≈23.86. But I'm not sure if RS is needed here.

Wait, but the problem is asking for ST, which I thought was 14. But the given angle and other lengths might not affect that, because midsegments are determined by the sides they're parallel to, regardless of angles.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the triangle RST can be analyzed using the midsegments and the given angle.

Wait, since XY is a midsegment, it's half of ST, so ST is 14. That seems straightforward. But why is RT given as 13? Oh, because XZ is a midsegment, so XZ is half of RT, which is 13/2=6.5, which matches what I used earlier.

So, perhaps the angle given is just extra information, but doesn't affect the length of ST, because midsegments are based purely on the lengths of the sides they're parallel to, not the angles.

Wait, but in that case, why would the problem give the angle? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating something. Let me double-check.

If XY is a midsegment, then it's connecting midpoints of RS and RT, so it's parallel to ST and half as long. So, yes, ST should be 14.

Alternatively, maybe the midsegments are not as I'm thinking. Let me confirm: a midsegment connects midpoints of two sides and is parallel to the third and half its length.

So, in triangle RST, midsegments would be:

- Between RS and RT: connects their midpoints, so XY, and is parallel to ST.

- Between RT and ST: connects their midpoints, so YZ, and is parallel to RS.

- Between RS and ST: connects their midpoints, so XZ, and is parallel to RT.

Wait, so XZ is a midsegment connecting RS and ST, so XZ is parallel to RT and half its length. Since RT is 13, XZ is 6.5, which matches what I had earlier.

So, in triangle YXZ, sides XY=7, XZ=6.5, angle YXZ=124°, so YZ can be found via Law of Cosines, as I did, giving YZ≈11.93.

But since YZ is a midsegment connecting Y (mid RT) and Z (mid ST), YZ should be parallel to RS and half its length. So RS = 2* YZ ≈23.86.

But I don't think RS is needed for the problem. The question is asking for ST, which is 2*XY=14.

So, perhaps the angle is a red herring, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but maybe the triangle is not a standard triangle, and the midsegments form a smaller triangle within, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using vectors or coordinate geometry.

Let me try assigning coordinates. Let me place point X at the origin (0,0). Since XY and XZ are midsegments, and given the angle between them, perhaps I can model this.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of triangle similarity. Since XY is parallel to ST, and XZ is parallel to RT, then triangle YXZ is similar to triangle STR? Or maybe not exactly, because the midsegments form a medial triangle.

Wait, the medial triangle is formed by connecting midpoints, so triangle XYZ would be the medial triangle of RST. So, the sides of XYZ are half the length of the corresponding sides of RST, and the angles are the same.

Wait, but in the problem, angle YXZ is 124°, so the corresponding angle in RST would be the same. But wait, in triangle RST, the angle at X would correspond to which angle?

Wait, no, because X is the midpoint of RS, so angle at X in the medial triangle corresponds to angle at R in RST? Or S?

Wait, maybe I should think differently. In the medial triangle, each angle corresponds to the same angle in the original triangle. For example, angle YXZ in the medial triangle corresponds to angle RST in the original triangle.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. In the medial triangle, each vertex corresponds to the midpoint of a side. So, point Y is the midpoint of RT, point Z is the midpoint of ST, and point X is the midpoint of RS.

So, in the medial triangle XYZ, the angles correspond to the original triangle's angles. So, angle at X in XYZ is equal to angle at R in RST. Because as the midsegments form, the angles remain the same.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps angle YXZ in the medial triangle is equal to angle RST in the original triangle. Because Y is the midpoint of RT, Z is the midpoint of ST, so line YZ is midsegment parallel to RS. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use vectors or coordinate geometry to model the problem.

Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let me place point X at (0,0). Since XY is a midsegment, and X is the midpoint of RS, Y is the midpoint of RT.

Wait, but I'm getting confused again. Let me try a different approach.

Since XY is a midsegment, it's parallel to ST and half its length. So, ST = 2 * XY = 14, which would be option I.

But then, why is the angle given? Maybe it's to confirm that the triangle is possible, but perhaps it's not necessary for calculating ST.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that XY is a midsegment between RS and RT, when in fact, it's between RS and ST. Wait, no, the problem says XY is a midsegment, so it connects midpoints of two sides. So, if X is on RS and Y is on RT, then XY connects midpoints of RS and RT, making it parallel to ST.

So, given that, ST is twice XY, so 14.

Therefore, the answer should be I:14.
</think>

In triangle RST, points X, Y, and Z are located on sides RS, RT, and ST, respectively, and XY and XZ are midsegments. A midsegment of a triangle connects the midpoints of two sides and is parallel to the third side, with a length equal to half of that side.

1. **Midsegment XY**:  
   - XY connects the midpoints of RS and RT, making it parallel to ST.  
   - Since XY = 7, the length of ST is \( 2 \times XY = 2 \times 7 = 14 \).

2. **Midsegment XZ**:  
   - XZ connects the midpoints of RS and ST, making it parallel to RT.  
   - Since RT = 13, the length of XZ is \( \frac{1}{2} \times RT = \frac{1}{2} \times 13 = 6.5 \).

3. **Angle YXZ**:  
   - The problem states that the measure of angle YXZ is 124°.  
   - While this information could be used to analyze triangle YXZ further (e.g., using the Law of Cosines to find YZ), it is not necessary for determining the length of ST, as the midsegment property already gives ST = 14 directly.

Thus, the length of ST is **14**, which corresponds to option I.
