Question:

A neighborhood homeowners' association hired a security company to provide an armed guard to patrol the neighborhood. One evening, the guard saw a young man stealing a rake that a homeowner in the neighborhood had left outside in his yard. The guard ran toward the young man. Seeing the guard, the young man dropped the rake and began to flee. Believing that the young man was about to escape, the guard pulled out his gun and fired a shot at the young man. The bullet struck the young man in the arm. If the young man asserts a claim against the security company for damages for his injuries, the young man will

Options:

A: prevail, because the guard did not give a warning that he had a gun and was about to shoot.
B: not prevail, because the homeowner's association approved the use of force in such situations.
C: prevail, because the guard should have called the police instead of taking matters into his own hands.
D: not prevail, because the guard acted within his rights to protect property within the neighborhood.
E: prevail, because the guard used unreasonable force to protect the homeowner's property.
F: not prevail, because the young man was engaged in theft when he was shot.
G: not prevail, because the injury was a result of the young man's own criminal activity.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically regarding the use of force by a security guard. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A neighborhood hires a security company with an armed guard. The guard sees a young man stealing a rake left outside. The guard runs towards him, the man drops the rake and flees. The guard, thinking he's about to escape, shoots him in the arm.

The question is whether the young man can successfully claim damages against the security company.

I remember that in tort law, the use of force, especially deadly force, is subject to certain rules. For a security guard or anyone else, the key is whether the force used was reasonable under the circumstances.

So, the guard was hired to protect the neighborhood. He saw someone stealing, which is a theft, a misdemeanor. In many jurisdictions, the use of deadly force is only justified when there's an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm. Theft, unless it's aggravated (like armed robbery), doesn't usually warrant deadly force because it's not inherently violent.

I think about the concept of "hot pursuit." If a security guard is trying to apprehend someone, they might have some authority, but it's limited. They can use reasonable force, but not deadly force unless necessary to prevent serious harm.

In this case, the guard shot the young man to prevent him from escaping. But the young man wasn't threatening anyone with a weapon or causing harm; he was just stealing a rake and then running away. So, using a gun here seems excessive.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the young man will prevail because the guard used unreasonable force to protect property. That sounds right because the force (shooting) was more than necessary for the situationâ€”a simple theft without any threat of bodily harm.

Option A says the guard didn't give a warning. I'm not sure if a warning is required in every case, but even if he did, the main issue is whether deadly force was justified, which it probably wasn't here.

Option B says the HOA approved the use of force. But even if they did, the guard's actions could still be illegal if they used excessive force. The HOA's approval doesn't make it lawful if the guard acted unreasonably.

Option C suggests the guard should have called the police. While that's a good idea, the legal issue is more about the reasonableness of the force used, not whether he called the police.

Options D, F, G, H all suggest reasons why the young man wouldn't prevail, mainly focusing on the theft or trespass. But the key is that using deadly force for a misdemeanor where there's no immediate danger is not justified.

So, the correct answer should be E. The guard used unreasonable force, so the young man would prevail.

The young man will prevail because the guard used unreasonable force. The guard shot him to prevent escape during a theft, but deadly force is only justified when there's an imminent threat of serious harm, which wasn't present here. The theft was a misdemeanor without any indication of violence, making the use of a gun excessive.

E
