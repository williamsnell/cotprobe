Question:

A new blood test to detect prostate cancer is evaluated in 300 male volunteers. A needle biopsy of the prostate gland is done on all men with serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations greater than 5 ng/mL (N<4). One hundred men undergo biopsy procedures; 90 are found to have prostate cancer, and five are found to have chronic prostatitis. Which of the following is necessary to calculate the sensitivity of this test?

Options:

A: Prevalence of chronic prostatitis in the general population
B: Prevalence of prostate cancer in the general population
C: Prostate biopsies of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL
D: Prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL
E: Number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and chronic prostatitis
F: Incidence of prostate cancer in the general population
G: Number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen
H: Number of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen
I: Number of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL and chronic prostatitis
J: Incidence of chronic prostatitis in the general population

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about calculating the sensitivity of a new blood test for prostate cancer. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my biostatistics, so I'll need to think carefully.

First, what's the question asking? It's about what's necessary to calculate the sensitivity of this test. I remember that sensitivity is about the test's ability to correctly identify those with the disease. Specifically, sensitivity is the proportion of true positive results. So, if someone has prostate cancer, how often does the test detect it?

The setup is that they evaluated this blood test in 300 male volunteers. A biopsy was done on all men with serum PSA (prostate-specific antigen) levels greater than 5 ng/mL. So, the cutoff is 5; above that, they do a biopsy. 

Out of the 300, 100 underwent biopsy. So, 100 had PSA >5, and 200 had PSA <=5. Of those 100 biopsied, 90 had prostate cancer and 5 had chronic prostatitis. So, the other 5 (since 100-90-5=5) must have had normal biopsies or some other finding, but the question doesn't specify.

Wait, the question says these are the 100 men who had biopsies. So, in that group, 90 are positive for cancer, 5 have prostatitis, and maybe 5 are normal? But I'm not sure about that breakdown. But that might not matter for the question.

The question is asking what's needed to calculate the sensitivity. Sensitivity involves true positives. So, we need to know how many people actually have the disease (prostate cancer) and how many of them test positive. 

In this study, the test is the PSA level. So, a positive test is PSA >5. The true positives are those with cancer whose PSA was above 5. But wait, how do we know that all the people with cancer in the study were correctly identified?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the study design. The 300 volunteers had the blood test. Then, those with PSA>5 got a biopsy. So, the 100 who underwent biopsy include those with true positives (cancer) and false positives (like prostatitis or others). But what about the 200 men who didn't get a biopsy because their PSA was <=5? Are they assumed to not have cancer? Or could they still have cancer but with lower PSA levels?

Ah, that's a key point. Because the sensitivity is about all the actual cases in the population, not just those tested. So, if some men in the 200 have cancer but weren't biopsied (because their PSA was low), then the test would have missed them. Those are false negatives.

So, to calculate sensitivity, which is TP/(TP + FN), we need to know the true positives (TP) and the false negatives (FN). 

In the given data, TP is 90 (cancer cases correctly identified because their PSA was high). But what about the FN? Those would be the men with cancer whose PSA was <=5, so they didn't get a biopsy. But the study doesn't tell us how many of the 200 men without a biopsy actually have cancer. Because without knowing that, we can't determine the FN.

Wait, but the question is which data is necessary to calculate the sensitivity. So, the data needed would be about the men not tested (i.e., those with PSA <=5) and whether they have cancer.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: Prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL. So, if we biopsied those men, we could find out how many have cancer but were not flagged by the test. That would give us the FN.

Because without knowing how many of the 200 have cancer, we can't calculate the FN. So, to find the sensitivity, we need to know the FN, which requires knowing how many in the PSA <=5 group actually have cancer.

Looking at the options, option D is about biopsying the men with PSA <=5. That would provide the necessary data.

Other options: Let's quickly consider others to make sure.

Option C: Biopsies of those with PSA>5. We already have that data, so it's not needed additionally.

Option E: Number of men with PSA>5 and prostatitis. That's about false positives, but sensitivity doesn't depend on false positives—it's about true positives and false negatives.

Options A and J: Prevalence/incidence in the general population. Maybe not needed because the study is in volunteers, and we're focusing on the sample, unless we're extrapolating, but I think the question is about what's needed within this study.

Options F and B: Incidence/prevalence in the general population. Not directly relevant here because sensitivity is about the test's performance, not the population's disease rate.

Option G: Number of men with PSA>5 and normal biopsy. That's the false positive rate but not needed for sensitivity, which is about actual positives.

Option H: Men with PSA<=5 and normal biopsy. If we knew how many in the PSA<=5 group are normal, but we still wouldn't know how many have cancer (the FN).

Option I: Men with PSA<=5 and prostatitis. Again, not directly relevant to the cancer status.

So the correct answer is D: Prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL. Because without biopsying them, we don't know how many have cancer and were missed by the test (false negatives), which is essential for calculating sensitivity.

To calculate the sensitivity of the new blood test for prostate cancer, it is necessary to determine the proportion of true positive results. Sensitivity is defined as:

\[
\text{Sensitivity} = \frac{\text{True Positives (TP)}}{\text{True Positives (TP)} + \text{False Negatives (FN)}}
\]

In this study, the true positives (TP) are the 90 men with prostate cancer whose PSA levels were greater than 5 ng/mL, leading to a biopsy and a correct diagnosis. However, the false negatives (FN) are the men with prostate cancer whose PSA levels were 5 ng/mL or below, and thus were not biopsied. Without biopsy results for these men, the number of false negatives cannot be determined.

Among the options provided, **Option D** ("Prostate biopsies of men with test results equal to or below 5 ng/mL") is the correct choice. Conducting biopsies on this group would reveal how many men with PSA levels ≤5 ng/mL actually have prostate cancer, allowing the calculation of false negatives and, consequently, the sensitivity of the test.

Other options are not relevant for calculating sensitivity:
- **Option C** is unnecessary because biopsy results for men with PSA >5 ng/mL are already provided.
- **Options A, B, F, and J** pertain to prevalence or incidence in the general population, which are not directly relevant to the calculation of sensitivity within this study.
- **Options E, G, H, and I** relate to other outcomes (e.g., prostatitis, normal biopsies) that do not affect the calculation of sensitivity.

Thus, the necessary data to calculate sensitivity is the biopsy results for men with PSA levels ≤5 ng/mL.

**Answer: D**
