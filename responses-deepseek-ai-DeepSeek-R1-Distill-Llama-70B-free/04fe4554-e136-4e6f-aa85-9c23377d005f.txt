Question:

Consider the ABO blood group locus in humans, which has six (6) alleles reported for it, of which three are most prominent, I^A, I^B andi. The I^A and I^B alleles are both dominant toiandcodominantto each other. A woman of blood group O marries a man who has blood group B. There are four children in the family: a son and daughter of blood group O; a daughter who has A blood type; and a son who has B blood type. One of the children is adopted. Which child is the adopted child?

Options:

A: the daughter of blood group O
B: The son with A blood type
C: the son of blood group O
D: the daughter who has blood group A
E: None of the children are adopted; a genetic mutation occurred
F: The daughter with AB blood type
G: the son who has B blood type
H: The son with AB blood type
I: The daughter with B blood type
J: The child with a rare blood type not listed

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about blood groups, and I'm a bit rusty on my ABO system, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about a couple where the woman has blood group O and the man has blood group B. They have four children, but one is adopted. The children's blood types are two O (a son and daughter), one A, and one B. I need to figure out which child is the adopted one.

First, I remember that blood type is determined by the ABO system, which has three main alleles: IA, IB, and i. IA and IB are dominant over i, but they are codominant with each other. So, the possible genotypes and phenotypes are:

- IA IA or IA i → Blood type A
- IB IB or IB i → Blood type B
- IA IB → Blood type AB
- ii → Blood type O

The woman has blood type O, which means her genotype must be ii because O is only possible when both alleles are recessive i.

The man has blood type B. So his genotype can be either IB IB or IB i. But wait, IB IB is possible, but IB i would also express as B. So his possible genotypes are IB IB or IB i.

Now, let's think about the possible offspring. Since the woman is ii, she can only pass on an i allele. The man can pass either an IB or an i, depending on his genotype.

If the man is IB IB, then he can only pass IB. So all his children would get an IB from him and an i from the mother. So each child would be IB i, which is blood type B.

Wait, but the children have blood types O, A, B, and O. So if the man is IB IB, then all children would be IB i (B), but there's a child with O and another with A. That's impossible. So the man must have the genotype IB i. Because then he can pass either IB or i.

So the man's genotype is IBi (IB and i). The woman is ii. So let's see the possible offspring:

Each parent gives one allele.

Mother: i

Father: IB or i

So the possible combinations for each child are:

- IB (from father) + i (from mother) → IBi → blood type B
- i (from father) + i (from mother) → ii → blood type O

So the children can only be either O or B. But in the problem, the children have blood types O, O, A, and B. So the presence of a child with blood type A is impossible if both parents are ii and IBi.

Wait, that's a problem. So where does the A come from? Because the mother is O (ii), she can't give an A allele. The father is IBi, so he can only give IB or i. So none of the children should have A blood type. But one daughter has A.

That suggests that the child with A blood type isn't their biological child. Unless there's a mutation or something, but the question says one is adopted. So the daughter with A must be the adopted one.

But let me double-check. Let me outline the possible blood types again.

Mother: ii → O
Father: IBi → B

Each child will get i from mother, and either IB or i from father.

So possible blood types:

- IB i → B
- ii → O

So among the four children, two are O and two are B. But the children are O, O, A, B. So the A is impossible, unless it's the adopted child.

Therefore, the daughter with A blood type is the adopted one. Wait, looking back, the options are:

Options:

A: daughter O

B: son A (but none of the sons are A, the sons are O and B, and one daughter is A)

Wait, the children are: son O, daughter O, daughter A, son B.

So the daughter with A is option D.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: daughter O

B: son with A (but the children don't have a son with A; the son's blood types are O and B)

C: son O

D: daughter A

E: none adopted, mutation.

So the daughter with A is D. So the answer should be D.

But wait, another thing to consider: the man's genotype. If the man is IB IB, then all his kids would be IBi, which is B. But if he's IBi, then as I thought before, the kids can be IBi (B) or ii (O). So the presence of a child with A is impossible. So the A child must be adopted.

The ABO blood group system involves three main alleles: **I^A**, **I^B**, and **i**. The woman in this scenario has blood type O, which means her genotype is **ii**. The man has blood type B, so his genotype is either **I^B I^B** or **I^B i**. If the man were **I^B I^B**, all children would inherit **I^B** from him and **i** from the mother, resulting in a genotype of **I^B i** and a blood type of B. However, since the couple has children with blood types O, A, and B, the man must have the genotype **I^B i**, as this allows for the possibility of passing on either **I^B** or **i**.

Given this, the possible genotypes for the children are:

- **I^B i** (blood type B) if the child inherits **I^B** from the father and **i** from the mother.
- **i i** (blood type O) if the child inherits **i** from both parents.

Thus, the biological children of this couple can only have blood types O or B. However, one of the children has blood type A, which is genetically impossible for these parents to produce. The only explanation is that the child with blood type A is the adopted child.

Among the options provided:

- **A**: Daughter with blood type O — This is possible for biological children.
- **B**: Son with blood type A — There is no son with blood type A in the family.
- **C**: Son with blood type O — This is possible for biological children.
- **D**: Daughter with blood type A — This is genetically impossible for biological children, so this must be the adopted child.
- **E**: None of the children are adopted; a genetic mutation occurred — This is unlikely, as the question specifies that one child is adopted.
- **F**: Daughter with blood type AB — There is no child with blood type AB.
- **G**: Son with blood type B — This is possible for biological children.
- **H**: Son with blood type AB — There is no child with blood type AB.
- **I**: Daughter with blood type B — This is possible for biological children.
- **J**: The child with a rare blood type not listed — This is irrelevant to the scenario.

The adopted child must be the daughter with blood type A.
