Okay, so I've got this question about pricing an asset-or-nothing put option using the Black-Scholes model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand the parameters given. The question says the company has written one million units of a European asset-or-nothing put option. The underlying asset is an equity index fund currently trading at 1000. It pays continuous dividends at a rate proportional to its price, with a dividend yield of 2%. The volatility is 20%, and the risk-free rate is 2.5% continuously compounded.

The option's payoff is only if the index is down by more than 40% at the end of one year. So, that means the strike price K must be such that the index is below K at expiration. Wait, no, wait. If it's down by more than 40%, that means the index is below 60% of its current value. So, 1000 * (1 - 0.4) = 600. So K would be 600, I think.

But wait, asset-or-nothing put options pay the value of the underlying asset if it's below the strike at expiration, right? So the payoff is S_T if S_T < K, otherwise nothing. Wait no, no. Wait, I might be getting confused. Asset-or-nothing put pays the asset itself (so S_T) if the option is in the money. So in this case, the option payoff is S_T when S_T < K.

Wait, no, wait. A standard put option pays max(K - S_T, 0), but an asset-or-nothing put would pay S_T if S_T < K. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think: in an asset-or-nothing call, you receive the asset if S_T is above K. So for a put, it's the opposite. So yes, if S_T < K, you get S_T; else, nothing.

So in this case, the option will pay S_T if S_T ≤ 600. Because it's only if the index is down by more than 40%, so below 600.

Now, Black-Scholes model. The formula for an asset-or-nothing put option. I remember that the price of an asset-or-nothing put is S0 * e^(-qT) * N(-d1) - K * e^(-rT) * N(-d2). Wait, no, that's for a standard put option. Wait, no, the standard put is K e^{-rT} N(-d2) - S0 e^{-qT} N(-d1).

Wait no, wait. Let me get this straight. The Black-Scholes formula for a European put option is:

Put Price = K e^{-rT} N(d2) – S0 e^{-qT} N(d1)

Wait, no, because for a call it's S0 e^{-qT} N(d1) – K e^{-rT} N(d2). So for a put, it's the opposite. So Put = K e^{-rT} N(-d2) – S0 e^{-qT} N(-d1). Because N(-d2) is 1 - N(d2), etc.

But wait, I'm trying to find the price of an asset-or-nothing put. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should model this as a binary option. Because an asset-or-nothing option is a type of binary option where the payoff is the asset itself if it meets the condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a regular put option, but with a different payoff structure. Wait, no, the standard put gives a cash payoff, while the asset-or-nothing put gives the asset. So the formula would be different.

Let me try to recall. The asset-or-nothing put option's payoff is S_T if S_T < K, else 0. So the present value should be e^{-rT} times the expected payoff under the risk-neutral measure.

In the Black-Scholes model, the risk-neutral dynamics are dS = (r - q) S dt + σ S dW. So the expected future stock price is S0 e^{(r - q)T}.

Wait, to value the option, I can express the payoff as S_T * I_{S_T < K}, where I is the indicator function. So the price would be e^{-rT} times the expectation of S_T * I_{S_T < K} under the risk-neutral measure.

But how to compute that expectation. Hmm. Let me think about it.

The risk-neutral probability that S_T < K is N(-d2), where d2 is as usual. But wait, the expectation of S_T given that S_T < K would involve integrating S_T over the lognormal distribution from 0 to K.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for this expectation. I remember that for a lognormally distributed variable, the expected value conditional on being below K can be expressed in terms of the Black-Scholes d1 and d2 terms.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the formula for the asset-or-nothing put is S0 e^{-qT} N(-d1) – K e^{-rT} N(-d2). Wait, that doesn't seem right because I'm trying to get the expectation of S_T given it's below K.

Wait, let me think again. The expectation E[S_T * I_{S_T < K}] can be written as e^{(r - q)T} S0 * N(-d1'), where d1' is something. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach. Let's recall that the price of an asset-or-nothing put can be derived similarly to a regular put, but with the payoff being S_T instead of (K - S_T).

In the Black-Scholes model, the formula for an asset-or-nothing put is:

P = S0 e^{-qT} N(-d1) – K e^{-rT} N(-d2)

Wait, no, that would be the standard put. Wait, let's think about the regular put option: it's the right to sell at K, so the payoff is max(K - S_T, 0). The asset-or-nothing put would instead have a payoff of max(S_T, 0) if S_T < K, but wait, no. Wait, no, the asset-or-nothing put gives the holder the asset itself if S_T is below K, so the payoff is S_T when S_T < K. But S_T can't be negative, so it's S_T if S_T < K, else 0.

So the present value is e^{-rT} * E[S_T * I_{S_T < K}].

In the risk-neutral framework, the expected value of S_T is S0 e^{(r - q)T}.

But to compute E[S_T I_{S_T < K}], perhaps we can use the same approach as for regular options but adjust the integrals.

The formula for E[S_T I_{S_T < K}] under the risk-neutral measure would involve the lognormal distribution.

Let me recall that for a variable S following S_T = S0 e^{(r - q - 0.5 σ²) T + σ sqrt(T) Z}, where Z is standard normal.

So, the expectation E[S_T I_{S_T < K}] can be written as the integral from 0 to K of S_T * f(S_T) dS_T, where f(S_T) is the lognormal PDF.

This integral can be computed and results in S0 e^{(r - q) T} N(d1'), where d1' is calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps I can find a formula for this expectation. Let me try to compute it.

The expectation E[S_T I_{S_T < K}] is equal to S0 e^{(r - q) T} N(-d1), where d1 is the usual d1 parameter.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think of the formula for a regular put option, which is K e^{-rT} N(-d2) - S0 e^{-qT} N(-d1). So, the present value of (K - S_T) I_{S_T < K} is equal to that.

But in our case, the payoff is S_T I_{S_T < K}, so perhaps we can find a similar formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express it in terms of the standard normal distribution. Let me define d1 and d2 as usual.

d1 = [ln(S0/K) + (r - q + 0.5 σ²) T] / (σ sqrt(T))
d2 = d1 - σ sqrt(T)

So, for the asset-or-nothing put, the price would be e^{-rT} * E[S_T I_{S_T < K}].

Hmm, I think the formula is S0 e^{-qT} N(-d1) - K e^{-rT} N(-d2). Wait, but that's the same as the standard put option formula. No, because in the standard put, it's (K - S_T), so it's K e^{-rT} N(-d2) - S0 e^{-qT} N(-d1).

Wait, but in our case, the payoff is S_T when S_T < K, so the expectation is E[S_T I_{S_T < K}] = S0 e^{(r - q) T} N(-d1) - K e^{(r - q) T} N(-d2) ??

Wait, maybe not. Let's think differently. The expectation E[S_T I_{S_T < K}] can be found by integrating from 0 to K of S_T * f(S_T) dS_T, where f(S_T) is the risk-neutral PDF.

The risk-neutral process for S_T is lognormal with parameters (r - q) and σ. So f(S_T) = (1/(S_T σ sqrt(2 π T))) exp( - [ (ln(S_T/S0) - (r - q - 0.5 σ²) T )^2 ] / (2 σ² T) ) )

So the integral becomes ∫₀^K S_T * f(S_T) dS_T.

Substituting variables, let’s set x = ln(S_T) → S_T = e^x, dS_T = e^x dx.

Then, the integral becomes ∫_{-infty}^{ln K} e^x * [1/(e^x σ sqrt(2 π T))] exp( - [ (x - ln S0 + (r - q - 0.5 σ²) T )^2 ] / (2 σ² T) ) ] dx

Simplify:

= 1/(σ sqrt(2 π T)) ∫_{-infty}^{ln K} exp( x - [ (x - (ln S0 - (r - q - 0.5 σ²) T ))^2 ] / (2 σ² T) ) dx

Hmm, this looks a bit messy, but perhaps I can complete the square in the exponent.

Let me denote a = ln S0 - (r - q - 0.5 σ²) T

So the exponent becomes x - (x - a)^2/(2 σ² T)

= x - [x² - 2 a x + a²]/(2 σ² T)

= (2 σ² T x - x² + 2 a x - a²) / (2 σ² T)

Hmm, perhaps not the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a substitution.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to recall that for a lognormally distributed variable with mean μ and volatility σ, the expected value conditional on being below K can be expressed as:

E[S_T | S_T < K] = e^{μ + 0.5 σ²} N( (ln(K) - (μ - σ²)) / σ ) / N( (ln(K) - μ) / σ )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a formula for E[S_T I_{S_T ≤ K}] under the Black-Scholes model.

Another approach: Let me express S_T in terms of a martingale. Under the risk-neutral measure, S_T = S0 e^{(r - q)T + σ W_T - 0.5 σ² T}, where W_T is a Brownian motion.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for the formula for the asset-or-nothing put option. From what I recall, the formula for the asset-or-nothing put is:

Asset-or-nothing put = S0 e^{-qT} N(-d1) - K e^{-rT} N(-d2)

Wait, but that's the same as the standard put option, which can't be right because the payoffs are different. Wait, no, no, let me correct that. The standard put is K e^{-rT} N(-d2) - S0 e^{-qT} N(-d1). So in that case, the asset-or-nothing put would have a different formula.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the put option. The standard put gives (K - S_T) when S_T < K. The asset-or-nothing put gives S_T when S_T < K. So perhaps the price can be expressed as the present value of S_T I_{S_T < K}.

Let me consider that the price is e^{-rT} E[S_T I_{S_T < K}].

In the risk-neutral world, S_T has a lognormal distribution with parameters (r - q) and σ. So the expectation E[S_T I_{S_T < K}] can be found using the lognormal distribution.

The formula for E[S_T I_{S_T < K}] is S0 e^{(r - q)T} N(d1'), where d1' is [ln(S0/K) + (r - q + 0.5 σ²)T]/(σ sqrt(T)).

Wait, let me compute d1 for the asset-or-nothing put. Wait, no, perhaps the formula is S0 e^{-qT} N(-d1) where d1 is computed as [ln(S0/K) + (r - q - 0.5 σ²)T]/(σ sqrt(T)).

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled up here. Let me try to look up the formula for an asset-or-nothing put. From my notes, the asset-or-nothing put is:

P = S0 e^{-qT} N(-d1) - K e^{-rT} N(-d2)

Wait, that's the same as the standard put, which can't be correct because the payoffs are different. So perhaps that's not right.

Wait, another approach: Since the asset-or-nothing put pays S_T when S_T < K, its value is the present value of E[S_T I_{S_T < K}].

Let me compute this expectation. The Black-Scholes model tells us that under the risk-neutral measure, S_T is a martingale, so E[S_T] = S0 e^{(r - q)T}.

But how to compute E[S_T I_{S_T < K}].

Let me recall that in the Black-Scholes model, the probability that S_T < K is N(-d2), where d2 is [ln(S0/K) + (r - q - 0.5 σ²) T]/(σ sqrt(T)).

But E[S_T I_{S_T < K}] is the integral from 0 to K of S_T f(S_T) dS_T, where f(S_T) is the lognormal PDF.

I think the formula for this expectation is S0 e^{(r - q)T} N(d1'), where d1' is [ln(S0/K) + (r - q + 0.5 σ²) T]/(σ sqrt(T)).

Wait, let me compute d1 and d2.

d1 = [ln(S0/K) + (r - q + 0.5 σ²) T]/(σ sqrt(T))

d2 = d1 - σ sqrt(T) = [ln(S0/K) + (r - q - 0.5 σ²) T]/(σ sqrt(T))

So, E[S_T I_{S_T < K}] = S0 e^{(r - q) T} N(-d1)

Wait, that's what I thought earlier. So then the price of the option would be e^{-rT} * S0 e^{(r - q)T} N(-d1) = S0 e^{-qT} N(-d1).

Wait, that seems too simple. But let me check the dimensions. The option is for one unit, but the company has written one million units, so the total price would be 1,000,000 * S0 e^{-qT} N(-d1).

Wait, but let me see: the company wrote the options, so they are short the options. So the price per option is S0 e^{-qT} N(-d1). But wait, that seems too high.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The expectation E[S_T I_{S_T < K}] is S0 e^{(r - q)T} N(-d1), because d1 is calculated with (r - q + 0.5 σ²) in the numerator.

Wait, let me compute d1 correctly. Let's plug in the numbers first, maybe that will help.

Given:
S0 = 1000
K = 600 (since 40% drop from 1000)
T = 1 year
q = 2% (dividend yield)
r = 2.5%
σ = 20% or 0.2

Compute d1 and d2.

d1 = [ln(1000/600) + (0.025 - 0.02 + 0.5 * 0.2^2) * 1 ] / (0.2 * sqrt(1))
= [ln(5/3) + (0.005 + 0.02) * 1 ] / 0.2

ln(5/3) is approximately ln(1.6667) ≈ 0.5108.

So numerator is 0.5108 + 0.025 = 0.5358.

So d1 = 0.5358 / 0.2 ≈ 2.679.

Then N(-d1) is the probability that a standard normal variable is less than -2.679. Looking at standard normal tables, that's approximately 0.0037 or 0.37%.

So the expectation E[S_T I_{S_T < K}] = 1000 * e^{(0.025 - 0.02)*1} * N(-2.679)

= 1000 * e^{
