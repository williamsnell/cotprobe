Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which pair of expressions are equivalent. Let me take it step by step.

The question gives me options from A to G, each with two expressions. I need to find which pair is equal. Hmm, okay. Let's go through each option one by one.

Starting with option A: 2x + 2x and 2x². So, 2x plus 2x adds up to 4x. But 2x squared is 2 times x squared, which is 2x². 4x is not the same as 2x², so A isn't correct.

Next, option B: x+x+x+x and x⁴. Adding x four times gives 4x. x⁴ is x to the fourth power, which is way bigger unless x is 1 or 0. So B can't be right either.

Option C: 3x +5x and 15x. Adding 3x and 5x gives 8x, not 15x. So C is out.

Option D: 4(2x -6) and 8x -24. Let me compute the left side. 4 times 2x is 8x, and 4 times -6 is -24. So that gives 8x -24, which matches exactly the right side. So D looks correct. But I'll check the rest to be sure.

Option E: 3x +3x +3x and 3x³. Adding them gives 9x, and 3x cubed is 3x³, which isn't the same as 9x. So E isn't right.

Option F: 7(2x) and 9x. 7 times 2x is 14x, which doesn't equal 9x. So F is out.

Option G: x added five times and x⁵. Five x's add up to 5x, and x⁵ is a much higher power. So G isn't correct.

So, after checking each option, D is the only one where the two expressions match. The others either add up to a different coefficient or involve exponents that don't equate.

The correct answer is the pair of expressions that are equivalent. 

- **A**: 2x + 2x equals 4x, which is not equal to \(2x^2\).
- **B**: x + x + x + x equals 4x, which is not equal to \(x^4\).
- **C**: 3x + 5x equals 8x, which is not equal to 15x.
- **D**: \(4(2x - 6)\) simplifies to \(8x - 24\), which matches the second expression exactly.
- **E**: 3x + 3x + 3x equals 9x, which is not equal to \(3x^3\).
- **F**: \(7(2x)\) equals 14x, which is not equal to 9x.
- **G**: x + x + x + x + x equals 5x, which is not equal to \(x^5\).

Thus, the equivalent pair is in **D**.

Answer: D
