Okay, so I've got this field extension question to tackle. The question is asking about the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) over Q. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my field theory, but let me try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with field extensions, the degree of the extension is the dimension of the larger field as a vector space over the smaller field. So here, Q is the base field, and we're looking at the extension Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)).

Wait, sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) is the same as sqrt(6), right? Because sqrt(a)*sqrt(b) = sqrt(ab) when a and b are non-negative. So sqrt(2)*sqrt(3) equals sqrt(6). So the field in question is Q(sqrt(6)).

Now, what's the degree of Q(sqrt(6)) over Q? I think that the degree of Q(sqrt(n)) over Q is usually 2 if n is not a perfect square because the minimal polynomial is x² - n. But wait, is 6 a square? No, because sqrt(6) is irrational. So the minimal polynomial of sqrt(6) over Q is x² -6, which is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion with p=2 or 3. So the degree should be 2.

Wait, but wait a second. The original question was phrased as Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) over Q. Does that change anything? Or is it just the same as Q(sqrt(6))?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking about the compositum of Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3))? Because sometimes, when you have multiple square roots, you have to consider the compositum, which can have a higher degree.

Wait, let me clarify. The notation Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) is a bit ambiguous. Is it Q generated by the product sqrt(2)*sqrt(3), which is sqrt(6), or is it the product of the fields Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3))? Hmm, I think it's the former because when you write Q(a), it's the field generated by a over Q. So Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) is just Q(sqrt(6)).

But wait, then the degree would be 2. So looking at the options, option I is 2. So is that the answer?

Wait, but another thought: maybe the question is about the compositum of Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3)) over Q. Because sometimes, when you have two extensions, the compositum can have a higher degree. But the way the question is written, it's Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)), which seems to be a single generator. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me re-express it: If I have Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), then that's the compositum, which would have degree 4 over Q, because Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is a degree 2 extension over Q(sqrt(2)) which is degree 2 over Q, so total degree 4. But the question is about Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)), which is just Q(sqrt(6)), right?

So if that's the case, then the minimal polynomial is x² -6, so the degree is 2. So the answer would be option I, which is 2.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another approach is to consider the tower of field extensions. If I have Q included in Q(sqrt(2)) included in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), then the degree from Q to Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) is 4 because [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] = [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] * [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] = 2 * 2 =4.

But in this problem, the field is Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) which is Q(sqrt(6)). So [Q(sqrt(6)) : Q] is 2. So the degree is 2, which is option I.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes, when you have multiple square roots, you have to consider whether the extension is simple or not. But sqrt(6) is a single element, so Q(sqrt(6)) is a simple extension of Q of degree 2.

So I think the correct answer is 2, which is option I.

The question asks for the degree of the field extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{3}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \). 

First, note that \( \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{6} \), so the field in question is \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6}) \). The degree of a field extension \( \mathbb{Q}(a) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is determined by the degree of the minimal polynomial of \( a \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \). For \( \sqrt{6} \), the minimal polynomial is \( x^2 - 6 \), which is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q} \) (e.g., by Eisenstein's criterion with \( p = 2 \) or \( p = 3 \)). Therefore, the degree of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is 2.

The question does not involve the compositum of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \) and \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}) \), which would have a higher degree (4 over \( \mathbb{Q} \)). Instead, it specifically asks about \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6}) \), which is a simple extension of degree 2. Thus, the correct answer is 2.

Option I corresponds to 2.
