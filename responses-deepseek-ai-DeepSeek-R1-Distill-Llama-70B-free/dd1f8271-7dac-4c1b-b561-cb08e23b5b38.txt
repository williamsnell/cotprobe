Question:

Assume that A. T. Hun's marginal propensity to save = marginal propensity to consume. If he makes an extra $1000 this year, and this increase in his income does not changehis marginal propensities, how much of this $1000 willMr. Hun save?

Options:

A: $800
B: $1000
C: $100
D: $300
E: $200
F: $750
G: $600
H: $400
I: $250
J: $500

Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that A. T. Hun's marginal propensity to save is equal to his marginal propensity to consume. So, if he makes an extra $1000 this year, and this doesn't change his marginal propensities, how much will he save?

Hmm. I remember that in economics, the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the amount of additional income that a household consumes rather than saves. Similarly, the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the amount saved out of additional income. 

Wait, so MPC plus MPS should equal 1, because whatever extra income you have, you either spend it or save it. Right? So if MPC equals MPS, each must be 0.5. Because 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.

So if he gets an extra $1000, his saving would be MPS multiplied by that income. So 0.5 * 1000 = 500. So he'll save $500.

Let me think if there's any other angle. Oh, wait, sometimes questions can be tricky about whether it's about average or marginal, but here they clearly state marginal propensities. So yeah, it's straightforward.

Looking at the options, J is $500. So the answer should be J.

The question states that A. T. Hun's marginal propensity to save (MPS) is equal to his marginal propensity to consume (MPC). Since MPC + MPS = 1, each must be 0.5. When Mr. Hun earns an extra $1000, the amount he saves is calculated as MPS × $1000 = 0.5 × $1000 = $500. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J: $500
