Okay, so I've got this problem about radiant heat transfer in a ventilating duct. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the setup is a duct with non-gray interior surfaces. The wall temperature is 600 K, and the duct has a thickness of 12 mm. Wait, but the thickness is probably not so relevant here since the question is about heat transfer at the wall, not through the duct material. The absorption coefficient of the duct is 120/m. 

Then there's this vapor flowing through the channel at 1100 K. Oh right, the vapor is emitting radiation. The black body radiosity of the vapor increases linearly over the boundary layer thickness of 2 mm and becomes constant at the outlet. So the radiosity starts at the wall and increases as you move away from the wall, reaching a maximum after 2 mm, which I guess is the boundary layer thickness.

The question is asking for the resultant radiant heat transfer at the wall. I remember that radiant heat transfer depends on the emissivity, the view factor, and the temperature difference between the gas and the walls. But wait, in this case, it's about the exchange between the vapor and the wall, considering the non-gray surfaces.

Wait, the wall has non-gray surfaces. So the emissivity isn't 1, but probably given. Hmm, the problem doesn't mention the emissivity of the wall. Did I miss that? Oh wait, maybe the absorption coefficient is part of the story. Oh, right, the absorption coefficient (denoted as κ) is given as 120/m. And the duct's wall is at T_w = 600 K.

I think the formula for radiant heat flux from a gas to a wall when the medium is non-gray and the gas's emissivity varies might be needed here. Oh wait, the black body radiosity increases linearly over a certain distance. So the radiosity isn't uniform; it's a function of distance from the wall.

In a gray medium, the emissivity ε is related to κ, the thickness L, such that ε = 1 - e^(-κL). But here, it's non-gray, but maybe the approach is similar in some way.

Wait, but the problem says the black body radiosity increases linearly. So the radiosity J (which is the black body radiosity) of the vapor goes from zero at the wall and increases linearly to some maximum value over a 2 mm boundary layer, then stays constant beyond that.

So probably, the average emissivity is considered. Because the radiosity varies with distance, the heat transfer would depend on the average value of the radiosity over the boundary layer.

Wait, but how is the heat flux calculated in such a case? I recall that the radiant heat flux q is proportional to the difference between the gas emissive power and the wall's emissive power, multiplied by some factor involving emissivity and view factor.

Alternatively, the heat flux can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, but adjusted for the emissivity of the gas and the wall.

Wait, the general formula for the net radiant heat flux from a gas to a wall is:

q = (ε_gas * σ * T_gas^4 - ε_wall * σ * T_wall^4) * (ε_wall / (1 - ε_wall + ε_wall * ε_gas))

Wait, no, maybe not exactly. I think when both the gas and the wall emit and absorb, the heat transfer is given by:

q = (J_gas - J_wall) * (ε_wall / (1 - ε_wall + ε_wall * ε_gas))

Where J is the radiosity. But wait, J for the gas might be its emissive power, which is σ T^4. But J_wall is also σ T_w^4. 

Alternatively, I remember the formula as:

q = (ε_gas σ T_gas^4 - ε_wall σ T_wall^4) / (1 - ε_wall + ε_gas ε_wall)

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've seen it written as:

q = (σ (T_gas^4 - T_wall^4)) * (ε_gas ε_wall) / (1 - ε_wall + ε_gas ε_wall)

Wait, if the gas is gray, then the heat flux can be calculated using this formula. But in this problem, the gas's radiosity isn't uniform; it increases linearly. So maybe we need to find an average emissivity for the gas.

But wait, the gas's radiosity increases linearly over the boundary layer, which is 2 mm thick. So for the region within 2 mm of the wall, J increases from zero to J_max. Beyond that, J is J_max.

So I think the approach is to compute the average radiosity in the boundary layer, then use that to find the heat flux.

Wait, another approach: for a medium where the absorption coefficient is κ, the emissivity ε depends on the optical thickness τ = κ * L, where L is the thickness of the layer. The emissivity is ε = 1 - e^(-τ).

In this case, the boundary layer is 2 mm, which is 0.002 m. So τ = κ * L = 120/m * 0.002 m = 0.24. So τ is 0.24, which is much less than 1, so the medium is optically thin.

In such a case, ε ≈ κ * L, because for small τ, e^(-τ) ≈ 1 - τ, so 1 - e^(-τ) ≈ τ. So ε ≈ τ = 0.24.

So the average emissivity of the gas in the boundary layer would be approximately 0.24.

Wait, but the problem says that the radiosity increases linearly. So perhaps the emissivity is not uniform, but the average is considered.

Alternatively, maybe the heat flux is calculated by integrating the radiosity over the boundary layer. But since it's a linear increase, the average would be half of the maximum value.

So let's think about this. The black body radiosity J is σ T^4. So the maximum J would be J_max = σ T_vapor^4. But wait, the vapor is at 1100 K. So J_max is σ*(1100)^4.

But wait, the vapor's radiosity increases from 0 at the wall to J_max at 2 mm, then remains J_max beyond that. So the average radiosity in the 2 mm layer would be (J_max)/2.

So the average J for the gas would be (σ T_vapor^4)/2.

But wait, how does this affect the heat transfer? The net heat flux would be the difference between the gas's radiosity and the wall's radiosity, multiplied by some factors involving emissivity.

Alternatively, since the wall is at a lower temperature, the net flux is from the gas to the wall.

Wait, the formula I remember for the heat flux when both surfaces are gray is:

q = (ε_gas σ T_gas^4 - ε_wall σ T_wall^4) / (1 - ε_wall + ε_gas ε_wall)

But in this case, the gas's emissivity isn't uniform. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the concept of the effective emissivity. Since the gas's radiosity increases linearly in the boundary layer, maybe the average emissivity for the gas is (ε)/2, where ε is the emissivity based on the boundary layer thickness.

Wait, earlier I calculated ε as approximately 0.24 for the boundary layer. So average ε would be 0.24, but since the radiosity increases linearly, maybe the average is 0.12? Or perhaps not, because the emissivity is a property of the medium, not directly related to the radiosity profile.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe another approach: the heat flux at the wall is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, multiplied by the emissivity of the gas and the wall, adjusted for any reflections.

But in this case, the gas's emissivity isn't uniform, but the problem states that the radiosity increases linearly. So perhaps the average gas emissivity is taken as (1/2) ε, because the radiosity is linear.

Wait, so J_avg = (J_max)/2. And J_max is σ T_vapor^4. So J_avg = (σ T_vapor^4)/2.

But then, the heat flux q would be J_avg - J_wall, multiplied by the wall's emissivity. Wait, no, because the wall can reflect some of the radiation.

Alternatively, the net heat flux is (J_gas - J_wall) * (ε_wall / (1 - ε_wall + ε_wall ε_gas)) )

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the formula. Alternatively, it's q = (J_gas - J_wall) * (ε_wall ε_gas) / (1 - (1 - ε_wall)(1 - ε_gas)) )

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of radiation exchange between the gas and the wall. The gas emits radiation which reaches the wall, and the wall emits radiation which is absorbed by the gas. The net heat transfer is the difference between these two.

So the heat flux q would be:

q = ε_wall * (J_gas - J_wall) 

But J_gas is the radiosity of the gas as seen by the wall. However, if the gas's radiosity varies with distance, then we have to find the average J_gas.

In this scenario, since J increases linearly up to 2 mm, the average J_gas over the boundary layer would be (0 + J_max)/2 = J_max/2. Beyond 2 mm, J remains J_max, but those contributions are not varying, so perhaps their contribution is negligible or considered as J_max beyond that point. But wait, the duct's thickness is 12 mm, but the channel's length would determine how much of the gas is in the boundary layer.

Wait, perhaps the problem simplifies by considering only the boundary layer, which is 2 mm thick. So the average J_gas is J_max/2.

So J_gas_avg = σ T_vapor^4 / 2.

Then, the heat flux from the gas to the wall would be q = ε_wall (J_gas_avg - J_wall).

But wait, J_wall is σ T_wall^4.

So putting it together:

q = ε_wall ( (σ T_vapor^4 / 2) - σ T_wall^4 )

But wait, I'm not sure if the formula is correct because the wall's emissivity would affect how much it emits and absorbs. Also, the gas's emissivity comes into play for its own emission.

Hmm, maybe another angle. The gas emits with an emissivity ε_gas, which depends on the boundary layer's optical thickness. As I calculated earlier, ε_gas = 1 - e^(-κ δ), where δ is the boundary layer thickness (0.002 m). So κ δ = 0.24, so ε_gas ≈ 0.24 (since τ is small, e^-0.24 ≈ 0.786, so 1 - 0.786 = 0.214, approximately 0.21. But earlier I thought τ=0.24 gives ε=0.24, but exact calculation gives around 0.214.)

But since the emissivity is low, the gas's emission is not too strong.

But then, the wall has its own emissivity, ε_wall, which we don't know. Oh wait, the problem states the duct's surfaces are non-gray, but perhaps the wall's emissivity is given elsewhere? Or maybe it's assumed to be black? No, the problem states non-gray, so we can't assume it's black.

Wait, the problem says the interior surfaces are non-gray, but doesn't specify their emissivity. So perhaps that's a missing piece. Hmm, but the problem gives the absorption coefficient of the duct, which is 120/m. Wait, the duct's absorption coefficient—wait, no, the duct's interior is the surface; perhaps the gas is the medium inside. Wait, no, I think the absorption coefficient given is for the gas.

Wait, no, the question says the duct has non-gray interior surfaces, so perhaps the absorption coefficient is for the walls, but that doesn't make much sense because absorption coefficients are properties of participating media, not solids. So maybe it's a typo, and the gas has an absorption coefficient of 120/m.

Alternatively, perhaps the duct is made of a material with an absorption coefficient of 120/m, but that's not how it's worded. The question says, "a ventilating duct with non-gray interior surfaces, at temperature T_w=600 K, has a uniform thickness of 12 mm and absorption coefficient 120/m." So the duct's surfaces (the walls) have an absorption coefficient of 120/m. But that's a bit unusual because absorption coefficients are for gases or semitransparent solids, not opaque surfaces.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and the gas has the absorption coefficient. Because otherwise, I'm not sure how to proceed without knowing the wall's emissivity. Because the problem doesn't give the wall's emissivity, but if I have to calculate it, perhaps it's from the absorption coefficient.

Wait, for an opaque surface, the emissivity and absorptivity are equal (by Kirchhoff's law). So if the wall's absorption coefficient is given, but that's typically for gases, not solids. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the absorption coefficient is for the gas. Because in radiative heat transfer in participating media, the absorption coefficient is a property of the gas. So maybe the duct's interior surface is at 600 K, and the gas inside has an absorption coefficient of 120/m.

So perhaps the setup is: the gas is at 1100 K, the walls at 600 K. The gas has an absorption coefficient κ = 120/m.

The black body radiosity of the gas increases linearly over the boundary layer (2 mm), reaching a constant at the duct's outlet.

But wait, the black body radiosity is the emission from a black body, so J_bb = σ T^4.

Wait, but for a non-black gas, the radiosity J is ε σ T^4, where ε is the emissivity of the gas. But the problem says the black body radiosity (J_bb) of the vapor increases linearly. So J_bb = σ T_vapor^4, and it's varying with position.

Wait, perhaps in the boundary layer, the temperature of the vapor isn't uniform, so T_vapor increases from the wall (at 600 K) to 1100 K over 2 mm. Wait, no, the problem states that the vapor is at 1100 K. Hmm, that can't be if the wall is at 600 K. Unless it's a boundary layer where the vapor's temperature increases from the wall to the bulk.

Wait, perhaps the vapor's temperature increases from the wall (which is at 600 K) to the bulk temperature of 1100 K over a boundary layer of 2 mm. So the temperature gradient is such that within the 2 mm layer, the temperature goes from 600 K to 1100 K, and beyond that, it's 1100 K.

If that's the case, then the radiosity J_bb of the vapor in the boundary layer varies with temperature. So J_bb at a distance y from the wall is σ T(y)^4, where T(y) increases linearly from 600 K to 1100 K as y increases from 0 to 2 mm.

So the average J_bb over the boundary layer would be the average of σ T(y)^4 from y=0 to y=2 mm.

But wait, if T(y) increases linearly, then T(y) = T_wall + (T_bulk - T_wall) * (y / δ), where δ is 2 mm.

So, T(y) = 600 + (1100 - 600) * (y / 0.002)

Wait, y is in meters? Yes, because 2 mm is 0.002 m. So y ranges from 0 to 0.002 m.

So, T(y) = 600 + 500 * (y / 0.002) 

Wait, 500 is 1100-600, and y/0.002 is the fraction across the boundary layer.

Wait, but that would give T(y) in Kelvins. So at y=0, T=600 K; at y=0.002 m, T=1100 K.

But integrating σ T(y)^4 over this would be complicated. Alternatively, maybe an average temperature is taken, or perhaps the average of T^4 is considered.

But wait, the problem says the black body radiosity increases linearly. So J_bb(y) = σ T(y)^4, and this increases linearly. So J_bb(y) is not linear in y, because T^4 is not linear in T, and T(y) is linear in y. So perhaps the problem is making an approximation, treating J_bb as increasing linearly, but that's not physically accurate. Unless maybe it's using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying by saying that the radiosity increases linearly, so the average would be (J_wall + J_max)/2. But J_wall would be σ T_wall^4, and J_max is σ T_vapor^4.

Wait, but J_wall is at y=0, which is the wall's temperature, 600 K. So J_wall = σ (600)^4. J_max is at y=0.002 m, which is σ (1100)^4.

So the average J_bb in the boundary layer would be (J_wall + J_max)/2.

Then, the net heat flux q would be the difference between the average gas J_bb and the wall's J_bb, multiplied by the wall's emissivity and the gas's emissivity.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the heat flux q is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law multiplied by the emissivity of the gas and the wall, considering the view factor. But since the duct is a channel, the view factor is probably 1, as it's surrounded by the walls.

Wait, another approach: the effective emissivity method.

The radiant heat flux from the gas to the wall can be calculated as q = ε_eff σ (T_gas^4 - T_wall^4)

Where ε_eff is the effective emissivity, which depends on the emissivity of both the gas and the wall.

But the effective emissivity ε_eff can be calculated as:

ε_eff = (ε_gas ε_wall) / (1 - ε_wall + ε_gas ε_wall)

But to find ε_gas, we can use the relation ε_gas = 1 - e^(-κ δ), where δ is the optical path length. In this case, the boundary layer is 2 mm, so δ = 2 mm.

So δ = 0.002 m.

Then, κ δ = 120 * 0.002 = 0.24.

So ε_gas = 1 - e^(-0.24) ≈ 1 - 0.7867 ≈ 0.2133.

So ε_gas ≈ 0.213.

But wait, if the
