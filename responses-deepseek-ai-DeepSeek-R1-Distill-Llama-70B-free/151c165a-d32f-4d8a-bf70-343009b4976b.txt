Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the UK Constitution. Hmm, I need to figure out which statement best describes it. Let's start by recalling what I know about the UK Constitution.

Wait, I remember that the UK doesn't have a single written document like the US Constitution. So it's not codified in one place. That means options B, E, or G might not be correct. Option B says it's codified and in a single document. No, that's not right because I think the UK's is uncodified.

So looking at the options, H says it's uncodified and found in multiple sources. That sounds familiar. I remember hearing that the UK Constitution is made up of various statutes, conventions, and other documents. So H might be the correct choice.

Let's go through the other options to make sure. Option A: a copy of the US Constitution? Definitely not. The US has a written constitution with a different structure, like the separation of powers. The UK's system is different, relying more on parliamentary sovereignty.

Option C: Can be changed by a simple majority in Parliament. Wait, I think that's true because Parliament is sovereign. They can pass laws, including constitutional changes, with a simple majority. But does that describe the constitution itself? Or is that a characteristic of the legal system. Hmm, but the question is about which statement best describes the UK Constitution.

Option D: Judiciary can overturn acts of Parliament. No, I remember that in the UK, the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty means Parliament is supreme, and courts can't overturn laws unless maybe through EU law, but since Brexit, that's changed. So D isn't correct.

Option E: Based on a Bill of Rights. The UK has a Bill of Rights, but that's just one part. Their constitution isn't solely based on it. So E isn't the best description.

Option F: Power derived solely from Parliament. Well, the UK Constitution's authority comes from various sources, including conventions, common law, statutes, etc. So F isn't entirely accurate because it's not solely from Parliament.

Option G: Based entirely on EU law. No, that's definitely not true, especially after Brexit. Even before, the UK had its own constitution alongside EU law.

Option I: Only source of power is the sovereign. That's not right because the UK is a constitutional monarchy, and the sovereign's powers are limited by Parliament and conventions.

Option J: Based solely on common law. No, because it's also based on statutes and conventions. So J isn't correct.

So putting it all together, the best answer is H: The UK Constitution is uncodified and can be found in a number of sources.

The UK Constitution is best described as uncodified and found in multiple sources, such as statutes, conventions, and common law, rather than a single document. 

Answer: H
