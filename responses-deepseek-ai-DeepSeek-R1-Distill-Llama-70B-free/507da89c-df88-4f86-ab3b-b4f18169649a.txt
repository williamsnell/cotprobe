Okay, so I've got this question about intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that IIED is a tort that involves one person acting in a way that intentionally causes another person severe emotional distress. The elements usually are: (1) the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly; (2) the conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) the actions caused emotional distress; and (4) the distress was severe.

In this scenario, the football player was dismissed from the team after missing practices. He met with the coach, who told him the other players despised him and he couldn't return. Then, as he was leaving, the coach said, "Hope you decide to transfer, because everybody hates your guts around here." That night, the player wrote a suicide note blaming the coach and attempted suicide by overdose. His roommate found him, and he was taken to the first aid center where he recovered.

So the question is whether the player can successfully claim IIED against the coach.

Looking at the elements:

1. Intentional or reckless conduct: The coach made those statements. Did he intend to cause distress? The coach's remarks were pretty harsh, but was the intention clear? Or was he just stating his opinion?

2. Extreme and outrageous conduct: The comments were certainly mean and could be seen as harsh, but courts often set a high bar for what's considered extreme and outrageous. Insults alone might not be enough unless they're particularly egregious.

3. Causation: The player's distress seems to follow the coach's words. But there's also the factor of the player's own actionsâ€”he took the overdose voluntarily. Does that break the chain of causation?

4. Severe distress: The player attempted suicide, which shows severe distress, but did the coach's words directly cause that?

I think the key points are whether the coach's conduct meets the standard for IIED. I recall that in some cases, mere insults or expressions of opinion, even if harsh, aren't enough for IIED because they don't meet the 'extreme and outrageous' threshold. The coach's statements, while hurtful, might be seen as opinion or related to the player's performance and team dynamics, not as an intent to cause severe distress.

Also, the player's overdose was a voluntary act. In tort law, if the plaintiff's injury results from their own voluntary actions, it can be a break in the chain of causation. So even if the coach's words caused distress, the player's decision to take drugs might be considered an unforeseeable or superseding cause, which would relieve the coach of liability.

Looking at the options:

Option I says the coach's remarks don't meet the legal standard for IIED. That makes sense because the conduct might not be extreme and outrageous enough. It's more about expressing an opinion, even harshly, rather than something beyond the bounds of decency.

Option J mentions the overdose was unforeseen. That's about causation. If the coach couldn't have reasonably foreseen the player would attempt suicide, then the player's action would break the causation, so the coach isn't liable.

Between I and J, I think I is more accurate because the main issue is whether the conduct was extreme and outrageous. The coach's statements, although mean, might not rise to that level. Courts are reluctant to impose liability for IIED based on verbal statements unless they're particularly outrageous.

So the correct answer is probably I: not prevail because the remarks don't meet the legal standard.

The football player's claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) against the coach hinges on whether the coach's conduct meets the legal standards for IIED. The elements of IIED include intentional or reckless conduct, extreme and outrageous behavior, causation, and severe emotional distress. While the coach's remarks were harsh, they may not meet the high threshold of being "extreme and outrageous," as they could be interpreted as opinions related to team dynamics rather than an intent to cause severe distress. Additionally, the player's voluntary act of overdosing may break the chain of causation. Courts typically require conduct beyond mere insults to qualify as IIED, and the coach's statements likely fall short of this standard.

Answer: I
