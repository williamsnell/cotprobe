Question:

A company has a permit to mine for gold in a region of New Mexico for 3 years. Management is trying to decide how to finance the machinery. One option is to rent it for $130 per month over the three years. The deal includes the fuel needed to operate the equipment. The other option is to buy the equipment now and. it after three years. The machinery costs $11,500. There is a down payment of $2,500, so that the balance due will be $11,500 - $2,500 = $9,000. This balance will be covered by a 5(1/2)% loan to be paid in equal annual installments over 15 years. The annual fuel costs for the equipment would be $375. If the minimum attractive rate of return is 5%, at what resale value (end of third year) will both options be equally economical? Make all calculations to the nearest dollar.

Options:

A: $8,400
B: $2,650
C: $6,825
D: $5,760
E: $4,248
F: $1,987
G: $7,950
H: $10,500
I: $9,937
J: $3,500

Okay, so I've got this finance problem here about a company deciding whether to rent or buy machinery for mining. Hmm, I need to figure out the resale value where both options are equally economical. Let's break it down.

The company has two options: rent or buy. Let me outline each option's costs.

Option 1: Renting. They pay $130 per month for three years, and that includes fuel. So that's straightforward. I'll calculate the total rental cost over three years. Three years times 12 months each is 36 months. 36 times 130 is... 36 * 130. Let me compute that. 36 * 100 is 3600, 36*30=1080, total 4680. So $4,680 total rental cost.

Option 2: Buying. It's a bit more complex. The machinery costs $11,500. They put down $2,500, so the balance is $9,000. They take out a 5.5% loan over 15 years, and they have to make equal annual installments. Plus, there's annual fuel costs of $375. Oh, and after three years, they'll resell the machinery. The resale value is what we're trying to find to make both options equal.

So the idea is to compute the present value of all costs for both options and find the resale value where they're equal.

Let me handle the buying option first. The initial outlay is the down payment, $2,500. Then, each year for three years, they have a loan payment plus fuel costs. But wait, the loan is for 15 years, so I think we need to calculate the annual payment for the loan, and then consider only the first three years' payments, along with the fuel.

So first, find the annual loan payment. The loan is $9,000 at 5.5% for 15 years. The formula for an installment loan payment is P * [i(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n - 1], where P is principal, i is rate per period, n is number of periods.

Here, P is 9000, i is 0.055, n is 15. Let me compute that. So the numerator is 9000 * 0.055 * (1.055)^15. Wait, no, wait. The formula is [i(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n - 1] multiplied by P.

Wait, maybe I should use the PMT function in Excel, but since I'm doing this manually, let me compute it step by step.

Alternatively, I can calculate it as:

Payment = (P * i) / (1 - (1 + i)^-n )

Hmm, let's plug in the numbers. P is 9000, i=0.055, n=15.

Denominator: 1 - (1.055)^-15. Let me compute (1.055)^15 first. Wait, 1.055^15. Let me see, 1.055^10 is approximately 1.819, then 1.055^5 more. 1.055^5 is about 1.340. So 1.819 * 1.340 = around 2.439. So (1.055)^15 ≈ 2.439. So 1/(1.055)^15 ≈ 1/2.439 ≈ 0.4098.

So denominator is 1 - 0.4098 = 0.5902.

So payment is 9000 * 0.055 / 0.5902.

9000 * 0.055 = 495.

495 / 0.5902 ≈ 838. So approximately $838 per year. Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.055)^15 more precisely. Let me compute it year by year for a few steps, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, use the formula for compound interest.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the exact value using a financial calculator approach, but since I don't have one, I'll proceed with approximate calculations.

Assuming the payment is approximately $838 per year. Wait, but maybe it's better to compute it more accurately. Let's see, 1.055^15.

Let me compute it step by step:

Year 1: 1.055

Year 2: 1.055^2 = 1.113

Year 3: ~1.172 (approx 1.055*1.113)

Year 4: ~1.055 * 1.172 ≈ 1.236

Year 5: 1.055 * 1.236 ≈ 1.305

Year 6: 1.055 * 1.305 ≈ 1.377

Year 7: 1.055 * 1.377 ≈ 1.454

Year 8: ~1.055 * 1.454 ≈ 1.535

Year 9: 1.055 * 1.535 ≈ 1.621

Year 10: 1.055 * 1.621 ≈ 1.709

Year 11: 1.055 * 1.709 ≈ 1.803

Year 12: 1.055 * 1.803 ≈ 1.903

Year 13: 1.055 * 1.903 ≈ 2.008

Year 14: 1.055 * 2.008 ≈ 2.118

Year 15: 1.055 * 2.118 ≈ 2.235

So (1.055)^15 ≈ 2.235. So 1/(1.055)^15 ≈ 1/2.235 ≈ 0.447.

Denominator is 1 - 0.447 = 0.553.

So payment is (9000 * 0.055) / 0.553.

9000 * 0.055 is 495. 495 / 0.553 ≈ 894.76. So about $895 per year.

So each year, the company would pay approximately $895.

Wait, but let me check with another approach. The present value of an annuity formula can help. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the more precise method.

Alternatively, I could use the PMT formula correctly.

Wait, the formula for the payment is PMT = P * [i (1+i)^n ] / [ (1+i)^n - 1 ]

So plugging in P=9000, i=0.055, n=15.

Compute numerator: 0.055 * (1.055)^15.

We have (1.055)^15 ≈ 2.235, so 0.055 * 2.235 ≈ 0.123.

Denominator: (1.055)^15 - 1 = 2.235 -1 = 1.235.

So PMT = 9000 * (0.123 / 1.235 )

0.123 / 1.235 ≈ 0.0995.

So 9000 * 0.0995 ≈ 895.5. So about $896 per year.

So the annual payment is approximately $896.

Now, the company will make three payments of this amount, and also pay $375 each year for fuel. So each year, the total cash outflow is 896 + 375 = 1,271.

But wait, the machinery is bought now, so the down payment is 2,500 at time zero. Then, over the next three years, each year the company pays 896 (loan) plus 375 (fuel), so 1,271 per year.

In addition, at the end of year three, the company will sell the machinery for the resale value, let's call it S. So that's an inflow of S at the end of year three.

So the total cost for buying option is the initial 2,500 down payment, plus the present value of the three annual payments of 1,271, minus the present value of the resale S.

Wait, no: The loan payments and fuel are outflows, and resale is an inflow.

So the net present value of the buying option is:

NPV_buy = -2,500 (initial) + [sum from t=1 to 3 of - (896 + 375) ] + S/(1.05)^3.

Wait, no, wait. The initial down payment is at time 0, so it's -2,500.

Each year, the company makes a payment of 896 (loan) and 375 (fuel), so total of 1,271 per year. So that's three payments at t=1, t=2, t=3.

At t=3, the company sells the machinery for S, which is a cash inflow.

So the NPV for the buying option is:

NPV_buy = -2,500 + [ -1,271/(1.05)^1 -1,271/(1.05)^2 -1,271/(1.05)^3 ] + S/(1.05)^3.

Wait, no: because each annual payment is at the end of the year, so for t=1, 2,3.

So the NPV would be:

NPV_buy = -2,500 + sum_{t=1 to 3} [ - (896 + 375) / (1.05)^t ] + S/(1.05)^3.

Similarly, the renting option has no initial payment, just 130 per month. So 130 * 12 = 1,560 per year. For three years, so each year t=1,2,3, 1,560 is paid.

So the NPV_rent = sum_{t=1 to3} [ -1,560 / (1.05)^t ].

We need to find S such that NPV_buy = NPV_rent.

So let's compute both NPVs.

First, compute NPV_rent:

NPV_rent = -1,560/(1.05) -1,560/(1.05)^2 -1,560/(1.05)^3.

Compute each term:

1.05^1 = 1.05 → 1/1.05 ≈ 0.95238 → 1,560 * 0.95238 ≈ 1,486.23.

So first term: -1,486.23.

1.05^2 = 1.1025 → 1/1.1025 ≈ 0.90703 → 1,560 * 0.90703 ≈ 1,413.46.

Second term: -1,413.46.

1.05^3 = 1.157625 → 1/1.157625 ≈ 0.86384 → 1,560 * 0.86384 ≈ 1,347.54.

Third term: -1,347.54.

So summing these: -1,486.23 -1,413.46 -1,347.54 = let's add the negatives first.

1,486.23 + 1,413.46 = 2,899.69. Plus 1,347.54 gives 4,247.23. So NPV_rent ≈ -4,247.23.

Wait, but I'm confused. Because the NPV is the sum of the present values. So if each is negative, then the total is negative.

So NPV_rent = -1,486.23 -1,413.46 -1,347.54 = -4,247.23.

Wait, but when we set the two NPVs equal, we have:

NPV_buy = NPV_rent.

So -2,500 + [sum of -1,271/(1.05)^t from t=1 to3 ] + S/(1.05)^3 = -4,247.23.

Wait, let me compute the sum in NPV_buy.

The sum is for three years: -1,271 each year.

So compute each term:

t=1: 1,271 / 1.05 ≈ 1,271 * 0.95238 ≈ 1,210.54. So term is -1,210.54.

t=2: 1,271 / (1.05)^2 ≈ 1,271 * 0.90703 ≈ 1,152.50. So term is -1,152.50.

t=3: 1,271 / (1.05)^3 ≈ 1,271 * 0.86384 ≈ 1,099.07. So term is -1,099.07.

Summing these: -1,210.54 -1,152.50 -1,099.07 = let's add the absolute values: 1,210.54 +1,152.50=2,363.04 +1,099.07=3,462.11. So sum is -3,462.11.

So NPV_buy = -2,500 + (-3,462.11) + S/(1.05)^3.

Which is -5,962.11 + S/(1.157625).

Set this equal to NPV_rent, which is -4,247.23.

So:

-5,962.11 + S/(1.157625) = -4,247.23.

Let's solve for S.

S/(1.157625) = -4,247.23 +5,962.11 = 1,714.88.

So S = 1,714.88 * 1.157625.

Compute that: 1,714.88 * 1.157625.

Let me compute 1,714.88 * 1 = 1,714.88.

1,714.88 * 0.157625 = Let's compute 1,714.88 * 0.15 = 257.23, 1,714.88 * 0.007625= approx 13.08.

So 257.23 +13.08= 270.31.

So total S ≈1,714.88 + 270.31=1,985.19.

Wait, but that's about $1,985, which is close to option F: $1,987. But let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let's compute 1,714.88 * 1.157625 precisely.

1.157625 can be written as 1 + 0.157625.

So 1,714.88 * 1 = 1,714.88.

1,714.88 * 0.157625.

Let me compute 1,714.88 * 0.1 = 171.488.

1,714.88 * 0.05 = 85.744.

1,714.88 * 0.007625 = Let's compute 0.007 = 12.01416, and 0.000625=1.0713. So total is 12.01416 +1.0713=13.08546.

Adding up: 171.488 +85.744=257.232 +13.08546=270.31746.

So 1,714.88 +270.31746=1,985.197 ≈1,985.20.

So S≈$1,985.20.

Looking at the options, the closest is F: $1,987. But let's check if perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the loan payment calculation. Let me double-check the annual payment.

Earlier, I approximated the annual loan payment as $896. But perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

The loan is $9,000 at 5.5% annually for 15 years.

The formula for the annual payment is:

PMT = (P * i) / (1 - (1 + i)^-n )

Plugging in:

P = 9,000

i=0.055

n=15

So denominator is 1 - (1.055)^-15.

Compute (1.055)^-15. As above, I approximated it as 0.447, but let's compute it more accurately.

Compute (1.055)^15:

1.055^1 =1.055

2: 1.055^2=1.113025

3: 1.055^3≈1.113025 *1.055≈1.1722.

4: 1.1722 *1.055≈1.236.

5: 1.236 *1.055≈1.305.

6: 1.305 *1.055≈1.377.

7: 1.377 *1.055≈1.453.

8: 1.453 *1.055≈1.534.

9: 1.534 *1.055≈1.618.

10: 1.618 *1.055≈1.706.

11: 1.706 *1.055≈1.799.

12: 1.799 *1.055≈1.898.

13: 1.898 *1.055≈2.003.

14: 2.003 *1.055≈2.115.

15: 2.115 *1.055≈2.232.

So (1.055)^15≈2.232. So (1.055)^-15=1/2.232≈0.448.

So denominator is 1 -0.448=0.552.

PMT= (9,000 *0.055)/0.552 = (495)/0.552≈896.43.

So more accurately, the payment is about $896.43 per year.

So the annual payment is $896.43, which I approximated as $896 before. So that's correct.

So then, each year's payment is 896.43 + 375 = 1,271.43.

So in the sum for NPV_buy:

sum = -1,271.43/(1.05) -1,271.43/(1.05)^2 -1,271.43/(1.05)^3.

Compute each term.

t=1: 1,271.43 /1.05 ≈1,212.00.

t=2: 1,271.43 / 1.1025≈1,271.43 *0.9070 ≈1,152.37.

t=3:1,271.43 /1.157625≈1,271.43 *0.8638≈1,099.17.

Sum of present values: -1,212 -1,152.37 -1,099.17 ≈-3,463.54.

So NPV_buy = -2,500 -3,463.54 + S/(1.05)^3.

Which is -5,963.54 + S/(1.157625).

Set equal to NPV_rent=-4,247.23.

So:

-5,963.54 + S/1.157625 = -4,247.23
