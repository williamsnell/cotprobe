I: Bc ⊃ (Pm • Gm)
J: Bc ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm)

Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of predicate logic. Let me take it step by step.

The question is asking me to translate the sentence "Cecilia breaks my heart if, and only if, Maria is either a problem or a girl" into predicate logic. The options are from A to J, each with different logical expressions.

First, I need to break down the sentence. The structure is "A if and only if B," where A is "Cecilia breaks my heart" and B is "Maria is either a problem or a girl."

I remember that "if and only if" translates to a biconditional in logic, which is the ≡ symbol. So the main structure will be A ≡ B.

Now, I need to define the predicates. Let's see:

- Let's say Bc stands for "Cecilia breaks my heart." So Bc is the predicate for that.
- Then, Maria being a problem could be Pm, and Maria being a girl could be Gm. So the second part is about Maria, so Pm and Gm are predicates where the subject is Maria.

The "either...or" part is a disjunction, which in logic is the ∨ symbol. So B, which is "Maria is either a problem or a girl," translates to Pm ∨ Gm.

Putting it all together, the sentence becomes Bc ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm). So that would be the structure: Bc if and only if (Pm or Gm).

Now, looking at the options:

Option J says Bc ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm), which matches what I derived. But wait, I should check the other options to make sure none fit better.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Bc ⊃ (Pm ⊃ Gm). This looks like an implication chain, which doesn't fit the biconditional structure we need.

Option B: Cb ⊃ (Pm • Gm). Hmm, Cb isn't defined, but assuming it's similar, but it's an implication, not biconditional, and uses • which is conjunction, not disjunction. So no.

Option C: Bc ≡ (Pm ⊃ Gm). This is a biconditional, but the right side is an implication, not a disjunction. So the "either...or" is not captured here.

Option D: Bc ⊃ (Pm ∨ Gm). This is an implication, not a biconditional. So only one direction, not both.

Option E: Bc ≡ (Pm • Gm). Again, uses conjunction, which is "and," not "or." So that's incorrect.

Option F: Cb ⊃ (Pm ∨ Gm). Again, Cb is different, but even if it's a typo, it's an implication, not biconditional.

Option G: Bc ≡ (Gm • Pm). This is a biconditional, but again, it's a conjunction, so "and," which isn't what we want.

Option H: Cb ⊃ (Gm ∨ Pm). Same as F, different subject, and implication, not biconditional.

Option I: Bc ⊃ (Pm • Gm). This is an implication with a conjunction. Not right.

So the only option that correctly uses the biconditional and the disjunction is option J.
</think>

The sentence "Cecilia breaks my heart if, and only if, Maria is either a problem or a girl" is translated into predicate logic using a biconditional (≡) for "if and only if" and a disjunction (∨) for "either...or." Letting Bc represent "Cecilia breaks my heart," Pm represent "Maria is a problem," and Gm represent "Maria is a girl," the correct translation is **Bc ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm)**. 

Reviewing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I** all fail to correctly combine the biconditional and disjunction or use incorrect logical connectives.
- **J** matches the required structure: Bc ≡ (Pm ∨ Gm).

Thus, the best translation is **J**.

Answer: J
