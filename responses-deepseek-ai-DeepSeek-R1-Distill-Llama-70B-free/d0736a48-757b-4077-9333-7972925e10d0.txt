D: The court should apply international negligence law.
E: The court should apply the negligence law of the state where the truck driver's company is headquartered.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which state's negligence law a federal court should apply in a diversity jurisdiction case. Hmm, I remember that when a federal court hears a case based on diversity jurisdiction, it has to apply the substantive laws of the state. But wait, how exactly does that work when there might be a conflict between two states' laws?

The question says a truck driver from State A and a bus driver from State B were in an accident in State B. The truck driver sues in federal court in State B. They're suing for negligence, and the amount is over $75,000, so diversity jurisdiction applies.

I think the key here is that the federal court sits in State B, so the first thing is, does the state where the court is sitting have a conflict of laws rule that would point to another state's law? Like, maybe State B's own conflict of laws rules would determine which state's negligence law to apply.

Wait, in federal diversity cases, the court applies the substantive law of the state in which it's sitting, including that state's conflict of laws principles. So if the federal court is in State B, it would look to State B's own rules to decide which state's law applies. For example, if State B follows the rule that the law of the place of injury (lex loci delicti) applies, then the court would use State B's negligence law because the accident happened there.

Alternatively, some states might have different approaches, like the "most significant relationship" test under the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws. But regardless, the federal court would first look to State B's conflict of laws rules to determine which state's law to apply. So in this case, the court in State B would apply whatever law a state court in State B would apply. That makes sense because the federal court is supposed to follow state law in diversity cases, including how the state resolves conflicts of law.

Looking at the options, option F says the court should determine which state's negligence law a state court in State B would apply and apply that. That sounds right. So the answer should be F.

Wait, let me double-check. Option B says the court considers both states' laws and picks which is more appropriate. But no, the federal court doesn't decide based on its own judgment of what's appropriate; it follows the forum state's conflict rules. So yes, F is correct.

In a federal diversity jurisdiction case, the court must apply the substantive law of the state in which it is sitting, including that state's conflict of laws rules. Here, the federal court is located in State B. Therefore, it will apply the negligence law that a state court in State B would apply, based on State B's conflict of laws principles. This ensures consistency with how state courts in State B would resolve such cases.

The correct answer is:

F: The court should determine which state's negligence law a state court in State B would apply and apply that law in this action.

Answer: F
