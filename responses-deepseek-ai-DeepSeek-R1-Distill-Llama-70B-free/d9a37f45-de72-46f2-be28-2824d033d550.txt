Okay, so I've got this question asking about the tallest trees on Earth, and I need to choose the right answer from options A to J. I'm a bit rusty on my tree knowledge, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the tallest trees are usually conifers, like pines or redwoods. I think the redwoods are some of the tallest. There's the Coast Redwood and the Giant Sequoia. I've heard that the Coast Redwood is the tallest, while the Giant Sequoia is the largest by volume. So maybe that's a clue.

Let me look at the options again. Option B is Coast Redwood and E is Giant Sequoia. So between those two, I think B might be the answer. But wait, what about other options? Let me think about each one.

Option A: Noble Fir. I think noble fir is a medium-sized tree, not the tallest. They're common in Christmas tree farms, I believe, but not known for being the tallest.

Option C: Sitka Spruce. I know spruces can be large, but I'm not sure if they're the tallest. Sitka Spruce is found in the Pacific Northwest, maybe, but I don't recall them being the tallest.

Option D: Coast Douglas Fir. Now, I think Douglas Firs are pretty tall. I've heard they can grow very tall, but are they the tallest? Maybe, but I'm not certain. I think they might not surpass the redwoods.

Option E: Giant Sequoia. As I thought earlier, these are massive trees, but their height isn't the maximum. They have a huge trunk diameter and volume, but not the tallest.

Option F: Yellow Meranti. Hmm, not sure about this one. I think Meranti trees are more common in tropical regions, maybe in Southeast Asia. They can be large, but I don't think they're the tallest in the world.

Option G: Bald Cypress. These are found in swamps, I believe. They have those knees sticking out of the water. Not sure about their height, but I don't think they're the tallest.

Option H: Mountain Ash. I know Mountain Ash has compound leaves with many leaflets. They can grow into medium-sized trees, but not the tallest. I think they're more known for their berries.

Option I: Ponderosa Pine. Ponderosa Pines are large trees, but again, I don't think they reach the height of the redwoods. They're more known for their wide trunks and being common in certain forests.

Option J: Western Red Cedar. These are big, aromatic trees, but I don't think they're the tallest. They have that distinctive red wood and are often used for outdoor construction because of their durability.

So, putting it all together, I think the Coast Redwood (Option B) is the tallest tree species. The tallest tree in the world is a Coast Redwood named Hyperion, which is over 380 feet tall. Giant Sequoias are bigger in terms of volume, but not height. So the correct answer should be B: Coast Redwood.

The tallest trees on Earth are the Coast Redwoods. Among the options provided, Coast Redwood (Option B) is the correct answer. While Giant Sequoias (Option E) are the largest by volume, Coast Redwoods hold the record for height, with the tallest individual tree, Hyperion, standing over 380 feet tall.

Answer: B
