Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the energy needed to compress three carbon-carbon single bonds and stretch three double bonds to the benzene bond length. Hmm, I remember that benzene has delocalized electrons and all its bonds are of equal length, which is somewhere between single and double bonds. The given length is 1.397 Å.

The question mentions using a harmonic oscillator potential-energy function for bond stretching and compression. Oh right, the formula for the energy is (1/2) k (Δx)^2, where k is the force constant and Δx is the change in bond length.

So the problem is asking for the total energy change when three single bonds are compressed and three double bonds are stretched. Wait, but wait—wait, wait. Wait, in benzene, each bond is the same. So if we're taking three single bonds and stretching them from 1.53 to 1.397, and three double bonds being compressed from 1.335 to 1.397? Or wait, no—wait, the problem says "compress three C-C single bonds and stretch three C-C double bonds to the benzene bond length." So each of the three single bonds is being compressed, which would mean their lengths are decreasing. Wait, no, wait: no, wait, the single bonds are longer than the benzene length. So to get to benzene length, which is shorter, they need to be compressed. Similarly, the double bonds are shorter than benzene's length (since 1.335 is less than 1.397), so stretching them.

Wait, no: wait, the typical single bond is longer (1.53 Å) than benzene's 1.397, so to make them 1.397, they have to be compressed. The double bonds are 1.335, which is shorter than 1.397, so they have to be stretched. So for each single bond, the change in length is (1.53 - 1.397) = 0.133 Å, and for each double bond, it's (1.397 - 1.335) = 0.062 Å.

But wait, the problem says three each. So three single bonds being compressed and three double bonds being stretched. So I need to calculate the energy for each of these processes and sum them up.

Each single bond's compression energy is (1/2) * k_single * (Δx_single)^2. Similarly, each double bond's stretching is (1/2) * k_double * (Δx_double)^2.

Let me write down the numbers:

For single bonds:
k_single = 500 N/m
Δx_single = 1.53 - 1.397 = 0.133 Å. Oh wait, but wait, 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. So 0.133 Å is 0.133e-10 m.

For double bonds:
k_double = 950 N/m
Δx_double = 1.397 - 1.335 = 0.062 Å = 0.062e-10 m.

Each bond contributes an energy change, and since there are three of each, I'll multiply by 3 each.

So the energy per single bond is (1/2) * 500 * (0.133e-10)^2. Multiply by 3 for three bonds.

Same for double bonds: (1/2) *950 * (0.062e-10)^2, multiplied by 3.

Let me calculate each part.

First, for the single bonds:

(1/2) *500 = 250.

(0.133e-10)^2 = (0.133)^2 * 1e-20 = 0.017689e-20 = 1.7689e-22 m².

So 250 * 1.7689e-22 = 4.42225e-20 J per bond. Multiply by 3 bonds: 1.3267e-19 J.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 250 * 1.7689e-22 = 250 * 1.7689e-22 = 4.42225e-20 J per bond. Three bonds: 3 * 4.42225e-20 = 1.32667e-19 J.

Now for the double bonds:

(1/2)*950 = 475.

(0.062e-10)^2 = (0.062)^2 * 1e-20 = 0.003844e-20 = 3.844e-22 m².

So 475 * 3.844e-22 = let's see, 475 * 3.844 = 475 * 3 is 1425, 475 * 0.844 is approx 475*(0.8 + 0.044)= 380 + 20.9= 400.9. So total approx 1825.9. So 1825.9e-22 J per bond. Wait, wait, no: wait, 475 * 3.844e-22 = (475 *3.844) * 1e-22.

Wait, 475 * 3.844:

Let me compute 475 * 3.844 step by step.

475 * 3 = 1425.

475 * 0.8 = 380.

475 * 0.04 = 19.

475 * 0.004 = 1.9.

So 1425 + 380 = 1805, plus 19=1824, plus 1.9=1825.9. So approximately 1825.9e-22 J per bond.

Multiply by 3: 1825.9e-22 *3 = 5477.7e-22 J. Which is 5.4777e-19 J.

Now, total energy is the sum of the two contributions: 1.32667e-19 J + 5.4777e-19 J = 6.80437e-19 J.

But wait, wait a second. Is that 6.8e-19 J total? But per mole?

Wait, no, because each bond is calculated per molecule. But the question is about per mole, right? Because the options are in kcal/mol.

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait no, the problem says 'calculate the energy needed to compress three... and stretch three ...' So I think it's per molecule because each molecule has three single and three double bonds. But wait, wait, no. Wait, this can't be right. Because the answer is in kcal per mole, so I must have to calculate per mole.

Hmm. So I need to compute the energy per mole for each of these.

Wait, okay, so first, find the energy per bond for each type, then multiply by Avogadro's number to get per mole.

Wait, but wait: for each single bond, the energy is (1/2) k x^2, and then multiply by 3 bonds. Similarly for double bonds.

So total energy per molecule is E_single + E_double.

Compute that, then multiply by Avogadro's number (6.022e23 mol^-1) to get per mole.

Wait, let me compute E_single and E_double per molecule.

E_single per bond: (1/2)*k_single*(Δx_single)^2.

So E_single = 3*(1/2)*500*(0.133e-10)^2.

Similarly, E_double = 3*(1/2)*950*(0.062e-10)^2.

Let me compute E_single first.

E_single = (3) * (250) * (0.133e-10)^2.

0.133e-10 is 1.33e-11 meters. Squared is (1.33e-11)^2 = 1.7689e-22 m².

So 3 * 250 * 1.7689e-22 = 750 * 1.7689e-22 = 1.326675e-19 J per molecule.

Similarly, E_double = 3 * (1/2)*950*(0.062e-10)^2.

Which is 3 * 475 * (3.844e-22) = 1425 * 3.844e-22 = let's compute 1425 * 3.844e-22.

1425 * 3.844 = (1400*3.844) + (25*3.844) = 1400*3=4200, 1400*0.844=1177.6 → total 4200+1177.6=5377.6. Then 25*3.844=96.1 → total 5377.6 +96.1=5473.7 → 5473.7e-22 J.

So E_double per molecule is 5473.7e-22 J = 5.4737e-19 J.

Total energy per molecule: 1.326675e-19 + 5.4737e-19 = 6.800375e-19 J.

Now, multiply by Avogadro's number to get per mole.

6.800375e-19 J/molecule * 6.022e23 molecules/mol = ?

6.8e-19 * 6.022e23 = 6.8 *6.022e( -19 +23 ) = approx 41.0e4 → 4.10e5 J/mol.

Because 6.8 *6.022 = approx 40.95, so 40.95e4 J/mol.

Convert J to kcal: 1 kcal = 4184 J.

So 4.10e5 J/mol / 4184 J/kcal ≈ let's compute that.

4.10e5 /4.184e3 → 410000 / 4184 ≈ approximately 98 kcal/mol.

Wait, but wait, none of the options are near 98. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me redo the calculation.

Wait, wait: 6.8e-19 J/molecule * 6e23 = 6.8 *6e4 → 40.8e4 J/mol → 4.08e5 J/mol.

4.08e5 J/mol ÷ 4184 ≈ 97.5 kcal/mol.

But the options don't have 97.5; the highest is 60. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, let's compute each part more accurately.

First, for the single bonds:

Δx_single = 1.53 - 1.397 = 0.133 Å → 1.33e-11 m.

(Δx)^2 = (1.33e-11)^2 = 1.7689e-22 m².

E_single per bond: (1/2)*500 * 1.7689e-22 = 250 * 1.7689e-22 = 4.42225e-20 J.

Three bonds: 3 * 4.42225e-20 = 1.3267e-19 J.

Double bonds:

Δx_double = 1.397 - 1.335 = 0.062 Å → 6.2e-12 m? Wait, no, 0.062 Å is 6.2e-11 m? Wait, 1Å is 1e-10 m. So 0.062 Å is 6.2e-11 m.

Wait, wait, 1e-10 meters is 1 Å. So 0.062 Å is 6.2e-12 meters? No, wait, 0.1 Å is 1e-11 m. So 0.062 Å is 6.2e-12 m? No, wait 0.1 Å is 1e-10 m * 0.1 → 1e-11 m. So 0.062 Å is 6.2e-12 m? No, wait, 0.062 is 6.2 x 10^-2. So 6.2e-2 Å = 6.2e-12 m? No, wait, no: 1 Å = 1e-10 m. So 0.062 Å is 6.2e-11 m. Because 0.062 * 1e-10 = 6.2e-12? No, that's not right.

Wait, no, wait. 1e-10 m is 1 Å. So 0.062 Å is 0.062 * 1e-10 m = 6.2e-12 m.

Wait, that's correct. So 0.062 Å is 6.2e-12 m.

Wait, so (Δx_double) = 6.2e-12 m.

So (Δx_double)^2 is (6.2e-12)^2 = 3.844e-23 m².

Wait, earlier I thought 0.062 Å is 6.2e-11 m, but that's wrong. It should be 6.2e-12 m.

Oh no, I think I made a mistake here. So let me correct this.

Hold on, yes. So I think I messed up the exponent. So for the double bonds:

Δx_double = 0.062 Å = 6.2e-12 m.

So (Δx_double)^2 = (6.2e-12)^2 = 3.844e-23 m².

So the energy per double bond is (1/2)*950 * 3.844e-23.

(1/2)*950 = 475.

475 * 3.844e-23 = let's compute 475 * 3.844 = 1825.9 → 1825.9e-23 = 1.8259e-20 J per bond.

Three double bonds: 3 * 1.8259e-20 = 5.4777e-20 J.

Wait, but earlier, for the single bonds, I had 1.3267e-19 J.

Wait, so let me redo the total energy per molecule.

Single bonds: 1.3267e-19 J.

Double bonds: 5.4777e-20 J.

Total: 1.3267e-19 + 0.54777e-19 = 1.87447e-19 J per molecule.

Wait, no: 1.3267e-19 is 13.267e-20. 5.4777e-20 is 5.4777e-20. So sum is (13.267 +5.4777)=18.7447e-20 → 1.87447e-19 J per molecule.

Then, multiply by Avogadro's number: 1.87447e-19 J/molecule * 6.022e23 molecules/mol.

1.87447e-19 *6.022e23 = (1.87447 * 6.022) * 1e4.

Compute 1.87447 *6.022 ≈ let's see:

1.87 *6 is 11.22, 0.0447 *6 is 0.268, so 11.22 +0.268=11.488.

Plus 1.87 *0.022 ≈ 0.04114. So total ≈ 11.488 + 0.0411 ≈11.529.

So 11.529e4 J/mol → 1.1529e5 J/mol.

Convert to kcal: 1.1529e5 J/mol ÷4184 J/kcal ≈ 27.57 kcal/mol.

Looking at the options:

Option G is 27 kcal/mol.

Hmm, but wait, let's make sure the calculations are accurate.

Hold on, let me compute 1.87447e-19 *6.022e23.

6.022e23 is 6.022 * 1e23.

1.87447e-19 *6.022e23 = 1.87447 *6.022 *1e( -19 +23 ) = 1.87447 *6.022 *1e4.

Compute 1.87447 *6.022:

Let me compute 1.87447 *6 = 11.24682.

1.87447 *0.022 = 0.041178.

So total 11.24682 +0.041178=11.287998 ≈11.288.

So 11.288 *1e4 = 1.1288e5 J/mol.

1.1288e5 J/mol → convert to kcal.

1.1288e5 /4184 = approx 26.99 kcal/mol. So about 27 kcal/mol.

Looking at the options, option G is 27 kcal/mol.

So the answer should be option G.

To calculate the energy needed to compress three carbon-carbon single bonds and stretch three carbon-carbon double bonds to the benzene bond length (1.397 Å), we use the harmonic oscillator potential-energy function:

\[
E = \frac{1}{2} k (\Delta x)^2
\]

### Given Data:
- **Single bond**:  
  - Typical length: \( 1.53 \, \text{Å} \)  
  - Force constant: \( k_{\text{single}} = 500 \, \text{N/m} \)  
  - Change in length: \( \Delta x_{\text{single}} = 1.53 - 1.397 = 0.133 \, \text{Å} = 1.33 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)  

- **Double bond**:  
  - Typical length: \( 1.335 \, \text{Å} \)  
  - Force constant: \( k_{\text{double}} = 950 \, \text{N/m} \)  
  - Change in length: \( \Delta x_{\text{double}} = 1.397 - 1.335 = 0.062 \, \text{Å} = 6.2 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m} \)  

### Energy Calculations:
1. **Energy for compressing three single bonds**:  
   \[
   E_{\text{single}} = 3 \times \frac{1}{2} k_{\text{single}} (\Delta x_{\text{single}})^2
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   E_{\text{single}} = 3 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 500 \times (1.33 \times 10^{-10})^2
   \]  
   \[
   E_{\text{single}} = 3 \times 250 \times 1.7689 \times 10^{-22} = 1.3267 \times 10^{-19} \,
