Question:

Optometrists use a linear scale of lens power, measured in diopters, to prescribe corrective lenses. Sufferers of myopia, or nearsightedness, have difficulty resolving distant objects because the lenses in their eyes are too strong. If a myopic person has a prescription of -5 diopters, what image do her corrective lenses create for distant objects?

Options:

A: An upright, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes
B: An upright, virtual image about 5 cm behind her eyes
C: An inverted, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes
D: An inverted, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes
E: An inverted, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes
F: An inverted, virtual image 5 cm behind her eyes
G: An upright, real image about 5 cm in front of her eyes
H: An upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes
I: An upright, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes
J: An inverted, real image about 5 cm in front of her eyes

Okay, so I have this question about optometrists and corrective lenses for myopia. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what I know about myopia and diopters.

Myopia, or nearsightedness, means that a person can see nearby objects clearly but struggles with distant ones. I think this is because the eye's lens is too strong, causing light rays to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it. So, the eyeball might be longer than normal, or the cornea is too curved.

Now, the prescription here is -5 diopters. Wait, diopters are the unit of lens power. A diopter is 1/meters, so a 5 diopter lens has a focal length of 0.2 meters, right? Oh wait, but the sign is negative. I remember that in optics, concave lenses have negative focal lengths and are used for correcting myopia. Concave lenses are diverging lenses, which spread out the light rays.

So, if someone has a prescription of -5 diopters, their corrective lens is a concave lens with a focal length of -0.2 meters, which is -20 cm. Because 1 diopter is 1/m, so 5 diopters is 1/5 m = 0.2 m.

Now, what do these corrective lenses do? For a myopic eye, the light coming from distant objects is converging too much. The corrective lens (concave) will cause the light rays to diverge, making it so that the eye can focus them properly on the retina.

Wait, but how does that translate to the image formation? When a diverging lens is used, the image formed by the lens is virtual and upright. Because concave lenses always produce virtual images, right? Unless they are part of a compound lens system, but I think in this case, the corrective lens is a single lens.

So, when the person with myopia looks at a distant object, the corrective lens will create an image that is virtual. The image's position depends on the focal length and the object distance.

In this case, the object is at infinity because it's a distant object. So, the image formed by the lens would be at the focal point. But wait, since the focal length is negative, where is the image?

I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The lens formula is 1/f = 1/v - 1/u, where u is the object distance. If the object is at infinity, 1/u is zero. So 1/v = 1/f. So v = f.

But f is -20 cm. So v would be -20 cm. Wait, but wait, the sign conventions. In optics, the sign of v depends on the direction of the image. For a diverging lens, the image is formed on the same side as the object, so the image distance is negative when the object is real (on the opposite side). So if the object is at u approaching infinity, then v = f. So in this case, v = -20 cm. That would mean that the image is formed 20 cm behind the lens. Or wait, is the image on the same side as the object?

Wait, I need to clarify the sign conventions. Typically, in optics, for a diverging lens, the focal length is negative. When the object is at infinity, the image is at the focal point on the same side as the incoming light. So for a diverging lens, the image is virtual and upright, located at the focal point behind the lens.

Wait, but if the object is real and on one side, the image for a diverging lens is virtual on the same side as the object. So the image distance is negative.

So in this case, the image is virtual, upright, and located 20 cm behind the lens. Because the object is at infinity, the image is at the focal point, which is negative 20 cm, meaning 20 cm on the same side as the object (so behind the lens from the viewer's perspective).

Wait, but the person is wearing the lens in front of their eyes. So the image is 20 cm behind the lens, which would be in front of the eye. Or wait, the lens is in front of the eye, so when the image is formed behind the lens, that would be on the same side as the eye. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of how the corrective lens affects the light. For a myopic eye, the lens is too strong, causing light to focus in front of the retina. The corrective lens (concave) makes the light diverge, so the light appears to come from a point closer than it actually is. So the image is virtual and located behind the lens.

Wait, if the object is at infinity, the image would be at the focal point of the lens. So for a -5 diopter lens, the focal point is -20 cm. So the image is 20 cm behind the lens. Since the person is looking at a distant object, the lens creates an image that's 20 cm behind it. But the eye can then focus on this image as if it were coming from that point.

Wait, but the eye's retina can't refocus on an image that's too close. Oh no, wait. No, in this case, the lens is creating an image that's virtual and behind the lens. So the eye can adjust its focus to that image.

Wait, another approach: the corrective lens is a diverging lens with a focal length of -20 cm. The object is at u = infinity. So applying the lens formula 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. Since u is infinity, 1/u is zero, so 1/v = 1/f → v = f = -20 cm. So the image is virtual, upright, and located 20 cm on the same side as the object. So for a person wearing the lens, the image is 20 cm behind the lens, which is in front of their eyes.

Wait, wait. The lens is in front of the eye. So the image is on the same side as the object. The object is at infinity in front of the lens. So the image is 20 cm behind the lens, which is on the same side as the object. Wait, no, that's not right. If the object is in front of the lens, and the image is same side, that would be in front, but the focal length is negative, so perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the image is virtual and located 20 cm behind the lens, which would be towards the eye. So the image is 20 cm in front of the eye because the lens is right in front of the eye. Wait, but 20 cm behind the lens would be 20 cm away from the lens, on the side opposite to the object. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the direction.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of real and virtual images. Concave lenses always produce virtual images when the object is real and beyond the focal point. Or wait, for any real object, the image is virtual because the focal length is negative.

Wait, let me think of the lens equation again. For a diverging lens (f negative), when the object is at a finite distance (not infinity), the image is virtual, upright, and reduced. But when the object is at infinity, the image is at the focal point.

So, for an object at infinity, the image is at f, which is -20 cm. So the image is 20 cm behind the lens. So from the perspective of the person wearing the lens, the corrective lens creates an image that is 20 cm behind it, which is on the same side as the eye. Because the lens is in front of the eye, so behind the lens is towards the eye.

Wait, so the image is 20 cm behind the lens, which is 20 cm in front of the eye? No, wait. If the lens is in front of the eye, then 20 cm behind the lens is 20 cm towards the eye. So the image is 20 cm in front of the eye. Because the lens is, say, 1 cm in front of the eye, then 20 cm behind the lens is 19 cm in front of the eye. Wait, that can't be right. Or perhaps the image is 20 cm from the lens, on the same side as the eye.

Wait, perhaps a real-life example: if I have a diverging lens with f = -20 cm, and I place an object at infinity. The image is formed at f, which is -20 cm, meaning 20 cm on the same side as the object. Wait, but in the case of a corrective lens, the object is in front of the lens, so the image is 20 cm behind the lens, which is in front of the eye.

Wait, perhaps that's getting me more confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it this way: the corrective lens creates a virtual image of the distant object at a point where the eye can focus it.

In myopia, the eye's focus is too close, so the corrective lens creates an image that is virtual and closer to the eye than the actual object. So the image is formed at a point that the eye can focus on.

So, the image must be virtual, upright, and located behind the lens, which for the wearer is in front of their eyes.

Wait, but how far? The focal length is 20 cm, so the image is 20 cm behind the lens. So if the lens is right in front of the eye, the image is 20 cm behind the lens, which is 20 cm in front of the eye.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the image is formed on the same side as the object. So if the object is in front of the lens, the image is also in front of the lens. But that can't be right because when you look through a diverging lens, the image is behind the lens (from the viewer's perspective). Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the image location relative to the eye. The corrective lens is in front of the eye, so when it creates an image, that image is virtual and appears to be behind the lens. So the image is 20 cm behind the lens, which would be 20 cm in front of the eye.

Wait, no. The lens is in front of the eye, so 20 cm behind the lens is 20 cm towards the eye. So the image is 20 cm in front of the eye? No, that can't be because 20 cm is a short distance and the eye can't focus on something that close when looking at a distant object. Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the image's position. For a myopic person, the image without correction would fall short of the retina. The corrective lens (diverging) makes it so that the image is formed further back, onto the retina.

So, the corrective lens creates an image that is virtual and located behind the lens. The focal length is -20 cm, so the image is 20 cm behind the lens. So from the eye's perspective, the image is 20 cm behind the lens, which is 20 cm in front of the eye.

Wait, but if the image is 20 cm in front of the eye, that's a very close object. But the person is looking at a distant object, so the image must be formed where the eye can see it as if it's coming from far away.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the options given.

The options are:

A: Upright, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes
B: Upright, virtual image about 5 cm behind her eyes
C: Inverted, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes
D: Inverted, real image about 20 cm behind her eyes
E: Inverted, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes
F: Inverted, virtual image 5 cm behind her eyes
G: Upright, real image about 5 cm in front of her eyes
H: Upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes
I: Upright, real image about 20 cm in front of her eyes
J: Inverted, real image about 5 cm in front of her eyes

So, considering that the image is virtual and upright, because diverging lenses produce virtual, upright images. So options B, C, F, H, and maybe others can be considered.

Wait, the image is virtual and upright. So options that have upright and virtual.

Looking at the options:

Option A: real, so no.

Option B: upright, virtual, 5 cm behind eyes.

Option C: inverted, virtual – no.

Option H: upright, virtual, 20 cm in front.

Option I: real – no.

Wait, the image is virtual and upright, so B and H are possibilities.

Now, where is the image located? We have the image at v = -20 cm (since f = -20 cm when u is infinity). So the image is 20 cm on the same side as the object. The object is in front of the lens, so the image is 20 cm in front of the lens. Wait, but that can't be right because that would mean the image is on the same side as the object, which is in front of the lens.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. The image is formed at v = f = -20 cm, which means 20 cm on the same side as the object. So if the object is in front of the lens, the image is 20 cm in front of the lens. So, from the person's perspective, the image is 20 cm in front of the lens, which is 20 cm in front of their eye.

Wait, but that's not possible because the eye can't focus on an image that's 20 cm in front of it when looking at a distant object.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. The object is at infinity, so u is infinity. So 1/u is 0. Then 1/v = 1/f → v = f. So for f = -20 cm, v = -20 cm. So the image is 20 cm on the same side as the object, which is in front of the lens.

So the image is 20 cm in front of the lens. So the image is 20 cm in front of the lens, which is 20 cm in front of the person's eyes.

Wait, but that would make the image appear 20 cm in front, so the person would see it as a close object, not a distant one. That doesn't make sense because the corrective lens is supposed to make distant objects clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the image is formed behind the lens, which would be in front of the eye, but that's not matching with the calculation.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. The corrective lens (diverging) takes the incoming parallel rays (from distant objects) and makes them appear to diverge from the focal point behind the lens. So the image is virtual and located at the focal point behind the lens, which is 20 cm.

So, for the person wearing the lens, the image is 20 cm behind the lens, which is 20 cm in front of their eyes. Because the lens is right in front of the eye, so 20 cm behind the lens is 20 cm in front of the eye.

So the image is virtual, upright, and about 20 cm in front of her eyes. Looking at the options, that would be option H.

Wait, option H says: An upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.

Yes, that matches. So the correct answer should be H.
</think>

Myopia, or nearsightedness, occurs when the eye's lens is too strong, causing light rays from distant objects to focus in front of the retina. To correct this, a concave lens (diverging lens) with a negative focal length is prescribed. The given prescription is -5 diopters, which corresponds to a focal length of $f = -20 \, \text{cm}$ (since $1 \, \text{diopter} = 1/\text{meter}$).

For a distant object (at infinity), the image formed by the lens is located at the focal point. Using the lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u},
\]

where $u$ (object distance) is at infinity, $\frac{1}{u} \to 0$. Thus, $\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{f}$, so $v = f = -20 \, \text{cm}$. The negative sign indicates that the image is virtual and located on the same side as the object.

In this case, the object is in front of the lens, so the image is 20 cm in front of the lens. Since the lens is worn in front of the eyes, the image is effectively 20 cm in front of the eyes. Diverging lenses always produce virtual, upright images, so the image is upright and virtual.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, D, E, G, I, J**: These describe real images, which are incorrect because diverging lenses produce virtual images.
- **B, F**: These describe images 5 cm behind the eyes or 5 cm behind the lens, which is inconsistent with the calculated image distance of 20 cm.
- **C**: Describes an inverted image, which is incorrect because diverging lenses produce upright images.
- **H**: Correctly describes an upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H: An upright, virtual image about 20 cm in front of her eyes.**
