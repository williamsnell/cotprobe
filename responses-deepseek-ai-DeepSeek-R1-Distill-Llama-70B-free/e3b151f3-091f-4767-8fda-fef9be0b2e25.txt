Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about a vertical cylinder with a diameter of 300 mm, which is filled with water at 70°C. There's a piston on top that's tight but frictionless. The outside of the piston is exposed to atmospheric pressure, which is 100 kPa. We need to find the minimum force applied to the piston that will cause the water to boil.

Hmm, I remember that boiling occurs when the vapor pressure of the water equals the surrounding pressure. So, the idea is that when the pressure inside the cylinder is reduced enough, the water will start boiling. But wait, in this setup, the piston is at the top, so applying a force might actually reduce the pressure inside the cylinder. Or does it increase it? Wait, no, if you apply a downward force, that would compress the water, but wait, water is nearly incompressible. Alternatively, if you pull up on the piston, you're reducing the pressure.

Wait, the piston is exposed to atmospheric pressure on the outside. So, when the piston is at rest, the pressure inside is atmospheric. But if you apply a force to the piston, that could either increase or decrease the pressure inside. Since the question is about causing the water to boil, we need the vapor pressure to match the pressure inside the cylinder. 

Wait, boiling occurs when the vapor pressure equals the ambient pressure. So, if the pressure inside the cylinder is lower than the vapor pressure at 70°C, the water will boil. Or wait, no, if the pressure is reduced, the boiling point decreases. Wait, no, the vapor pressure is a function of temperature. So, at 70°C, the vapor pressure is some value. If the surrounding pressure is lower than that, the water will boil.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by the vapor when the liquid and vapor are in equilibrium at a given temperature. So, at 70°C, the vapor pressure of water is lower than the standard atmospheric pressure (100 kPa). Wait, no, let me check. I think at 100°C, the vapor pressure is 101.3 kPa (standard atmospheric pressure), which is why water boils at 100°C under standard conditions. So, at 70°C, the vapor pressure is lower. Let me confirm the vapor pressure of water at 70°C. I think it's about 31 kPa or something like that.

Wait, maybe I should look up the vapor pressure of water at 70°C. From my notes, I remember that at 70°C, the vapor pressure is approximately 31.2 kPa. Yeah, that sounds right.

So, the atmospheric pressure outside the piston is 100 kPa. The piston is frictionless and tight, so it's going to transmit the pressure. So, the water is initially at 70°C, and the pressure inside the cylinder is atmospheric (since the piston is at the top, and assuming before any force is applied, the pressure is 100 kPa). But we want to make the water boil, which happens when the surrounding pressure equals the vapor pressure at that temperature. Wait, no, the water will boil when the surrounding pressure is equal to the vapor pressure. Because when you lower the pressure, the boiling point decreases. So, if the pressure is reduced, the water will start boiling at a lower temperature.

Wait no, in this case, the temperature is fixed at 70°C. So the vapor pressure at 70°C is about 31.2 kPa. So, to make the water boil, the pressure in the cylinder must be reduced to 31.2 kPa. Because when the pressure is lower than the vapor pressure, the liquid will vaporize.

Wait, no. Wait, the vapor pressure is the pressure at which the liquid and vapor are in equilibrium. So, if the ambient pressure is lower than the vapor pressure, the liquid will boil. So, if the pressure inside the cylinder is reduced to the vapor pressure of water at 70°C (31.2 kPa), then boiling will occur.

So, the idea is that we need to create a pressure inside the cylinder of 31.2 kPa. Because the piston is exposed to atmospheric pressure (100 kPa), we can model this as a force balance on the piston.

The piston is frictionless, so the force applied (F) will create a pressure inside the cylinder. Let me think about the forces.

The piston has an area A. The atmospheric pressure P_atm acts on the outside, pushing down with a force F_atm = P_atm * A. The force applied on the piston (F) is upward, trying to reduce the pressure inside. Wait, no, if you apply a force upward on the piston, you're stretching the water, which is almost incompressible, so actually, you're reducing the pressure inside because you're increasing the volume. Wait, but in a vertical cylinder, if you pull up on the piston, you're increasing the volume, which would lower the pressure. So, the pressure inside becomes lower than atmospheric, and the atmospheric pressure pushes the piston down.

Wait, but the question says the cylinder is completely filled with water. So, if you apply a force F upward, you're trying to expand the water, but since water is incompressible, it's difficult. But in reality, some expansion might occur, lowering the pressure until the vapor pressure is reached, causing boiling.

Alternatively, perhaps the force applied is the force that, when combined with the atmospheric pressure, results in the pressure inside being equal to the vapor pressure. Hmm, maybe I should model it as the pressure inside being P_vapor, and the force applied is such that the net pressure is P_vapor.

Wait, the piston is exposed to atmospheric pressure on the outside. So the force balance on the piston would be: F_applied + (P_inside * A) = P_atm * A. Because atmospheric pressure is pushing down, and the applied force plus the internal pressure is pushing up.

Wait, let me draw it out mentally. The piston is in equilibrium, so the sum of the forces upward equals the sum downward. The forces downward are the atmospheric pressure force (P_atm * A) and the force F (applied downward? Or is it upward?)

Wait, no, if F is the force applied by someone pushing down on the piston, then the forces would be F downward and P_atm * A downward as well, while the internal pressure P_inside * A upward.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify. The piston is at the top, and the cylinder is vertical. The piston is tight but frictionless. The outside is atmospheric pressure (100 kPa). The inside is filled with water at 70°C.

So, when no force is applied, the pressure inside is atmospheric, because the piston can move freely. But when you apply a force to the piston, you change the pressure inside.

Wait, if you apply a downward force, you're compressing the water, but since water is nearly incompressible, the pressure would rise. But we're trying to make the water boil, which requires lower pressure, not higher. So maybe the force is applied upward, trying to pull the piston up, which would reduce the pressure inside.

But in that case, the pressure inside would be lower than atmospheric, so the atmospheric pressure would push the piston back down.

So, the force applied (F) upward would have to counteract the atmospheric pressure's downward force, adjusted by the internal pressure.

Wait, the force balance equation should be:

F_applied (upward) + P_inside * A (upward) = P_atm * A (downward)

Wait, no, that can't be right because P_atm is on the outside, pushing down, and P_inside is pushing up. So the correct equation is:

P_inside * A = F_applied + P_atm * A.

Wait, no, because the piston is subject to atmospheric pressure on the outside. So, the forces on the piston are:

Upward: P_inside * A.

Downward: P_atm * A + F_applied.

Since the piston is in equilibrium, the upward force must equal the downward forces.

So, P_inside * A = P_atm * A + F_applied.

Wait, that's the correct equation. Because the pressure inside is pushing up, and the atmospheric pressure plus any applied force is pushing down.

Wait, but wait—if F_applied is the force you're applying downward, then yes. But if F_applied is upward, then it's on the same side as P_inside. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. Let's model the piston as a plate. The forces acting on it are:

From the inside: pressure P_inside acting upward on the piston, force = P_inside * A.

From the outside: atmospheric pressure P_atm acting downward, force = P_atm * A.

Additionally, any applied force F. If the applied force is downward, it adds to the P_atm * A. If it's upward, it subtracts.

Wait, but in our case, to reduce the internal pressure, we need to pull upward on the piston, making the internal pressure lower.

So, the applied force is upward, which would reduce the net downward force. So, the force balance equation would be:

P_inside * A = P_atm * A - F_applied.

Because F_applied is upward, opposing the atmospheric pressure.

Wait, that makes sense. So when you apply an upward force, you're reducing the net downward force, hence allowing the internal pressure to be lower.

Wait, but if the piston is in equilibrium, the sum of the forces upward equals the sum downward. So:

Upward forces: P_inside * A + F_applied.

Downward forces: P_atm * A.

So, P_inside * A + F_applied = P_atm * A.

Which rearranges to F_applied = (P_atm - P_inside) * A.

Ah, that makes sense. So the applied force (upward) must make up the difference between the atmospheric pressure and the internal pressure.

In this scenario, we want the internal pressure P_inside to be equal to the vapor pressure at 70°C, which is about 31.2 kPa.

So, P_inside = 31.2 kPa.

P_atm is 100 kPa.

So, F_applied = (100 kPa - 31.2 kPa) * A.

First, let me calculate the area A. The cylinder has a diameter of 300 mm, so radius is 150 mm or 0.15 meters.

Area A = π r² = π (0.15)^2 = π * 0.0225 ≈ 0.0706858 m².

Now, F_applied = (100,000 Pa - 31,200 Pa) * 0.0706858 m².

Wait, 100 kPa is 100,000 Pa, and 31.2 kPa is 31,200 Pa.

So, 100,000 - 31,200 = 68,800 Pa.

F_applied = 68,800 Pa * 0.0706858 m².

Let me compute that:

68,800 * 0.0706858 ≈ ?

Let me calculate step by step.

68,800 * 0.07 = 4,816.

68,800 * 0.0006858 ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute 68,800 * 0.0706858.

Multiplying 68,800 by 0.0706858:

0.0706858 = 7.06858e-2.

68,800 * 7.06858e-2 = let's compute 68,800 * 7.06858e-2.

68,800 * 0.07 = 4,816.

0.0006858 is 6.858e-4.

So 68,800 * 6.858e-4 = 68,800 * 0.0006858 ≈ 47.15.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach:

0.0706858 * 68,800.

Compute 68,800 * 0.07 = 4,816.

68,800 * 0.0006858 ≈ 68,800 * 0.0006 = 41.28, plus 68,800 * 0.0000858 ≈ approximately 5.90.

So 41.28 + 5.90 = 47.18.

So total F ≈ 4,816 + 47.18 = 4,863.18 N.

Which is approximately 4,863 Newtons, or about 4.863 kN.

Looking at the options, option H is 4.86kN, which matches.

Wait, but let me check if all my steps are correct.

Wait, the area calculation: diameter 300 mm is 0.3 m, radius 0.15 m.

A = π*(0.15)^2 = π * 0.0225 ≈ 0.0706858 m². Correct.

P_inside is vapor pressure at 70°C, which I took as 31.2 kPa. I think that's correct. Let me double-check: yes, at 70°C, the vapor pressure is around 31.2 kPa.

So, F = (100 - 31.2) kPa * A.

Which is 68.8 kPa * 0.0706858 m².

Wait, 68.8 kPa is 68,800 Pa, yes.

So, 68,800 * 0.0706858 = ?

Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.0706858 * 68,800:

0.07 * 68,800 = 4,816.

0.0006858 * 68,800 = let's compute 68,800 * 0.0006 = 41.28.

68,800 * 0.0000858 = ?

Well, 68,800 * 0.00008 = 5.504.

68,800 * 0.0000058 = approx 0.400.

So 5.504 + 0.400 ≈ 5.904.

So 41.28 + 5.904 ≈ 47.184.

So total F = 4,816 + 47.184 ≈ 4,863.184 N.

That's about 4,863 N, which is 4.863 kN. So the closest option is H: 4.86kN.

Yes, so the correct answer should be H.

To determine the minimum force required to cause the water to boil, we analyze the pressure and force balance in the system. The cylinder is filled with water at 70°C, and the piston is exposed to atmospheric pressure (100 kPa). Boiling occurs when the internal pressure equals the vapor pressure of water at 70°C, which is approximately **31.2 kPa**.

### Key Steps:
1. **Force Balance on the Piston**:  
   The piston is in equilibrium, so the upward forces (internal pressure and applied force) must equal the downward forces (atmospheric pressure). The relationship is:  
   \[
   F_{\text{applied}} = (P_{\text{atm}} - P_{\text{inside}}) \cdot A
   \]  
   where \(P_{\text{atm}} = 100 \, \text{kPa}\), \(P_{\text{inside}} = 31.2 \, \text{kPa}\), and \(A\) is the cross-sectional area of the piston.

2. **Calculate the Cross-Sectional Area**:  
   The cylinder has a diameter of 300 mm, so the radius is \(r = 0.15 \, \text{m}\). The area is:  
   \[
   A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.15)^2 \approx 0.0706858 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

3. **Compute the Applied Force**:  
   Substituting the values into the force equation:  
   \[
   F_{\text{applied}} = (100,000 - 31,200) \cdot 0.0706858
   \]  
   \[
   F_{\text{applied}} = 68,800 \cdot 0.0706858 \approx 4,863.18 \, \text{N}
   \]  
   Converting to kilonewtons:  
   \[
   F_{\text{applied}} \approx 4.86 \, \text{kN}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The minimum force required to cause the water to boil is approximately **4.86 kN**, which corresponds to option **H**.
