Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the equilibrium of CO2 and water forming H3O+ and HCO3^-. I'm a bit rusty on my equilibrium calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me the Ka, which is 4.3 × 10^-7, and the pH is 7.40. I need to find the ratio of the concentrations of bicarbonate (HCO3^-) to carbon dioxide (CO2). Hmm, right, so the ratio is [HCO3^-]/[CO2].

I remember that the Ka expression for this equilibrium is written as Ka = [H3O+][HCO3^-] / [CO2][H2O]. But wait, since water is a pure liquid, its concentration is taken as 1, so the expression simplifies to Ka = [H3O+][HCO3^-] / [CO2].

Oh wait, and [H3O+] is related to pH. Since pH is given as 7.40, I can find [H3O+] by using pH = -log[H3O+]. So [H3O+] = 10^-pH, which is 10^-7.40. Let me calculate that. 10^-7 is 1e-7, and 10^-0.40 is about 0.398, so 1e-7 * 0.398 is approximately 3.98e-8. I'll just note it as [H3O+] ≈ 4.0e-8 for simplicity.

Now, substituting into the Ka expression:

Ka = [H3O+][HCO3^-] / [CO2] = 4.3e-7.

Let me rearrange the equation to find the ratio [HCO3^-]/[CO2]. If I divide both sides by [H3O+], I get:

[HCO3^-]/[CO2] = Ka / [H3O+].

Plugging in the numbers, that's (4.3e-7) / (4.0e-8). Let me compute that. 4.3 divided by 4 is approximately 1.075. Then, 1e-7 divided by 1e-8 is 10. So 1.075 * 10 = 10.75. So the ratio is about 10.75.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. 4.3e-7 divided by 4e-8 is (4.3/4) * (1e-7 / 1e-8) = 1.075 * 10 = 10.75. Yeah, that seems right.

Looking at the options, option B is 10.75. So the answer should be B.

To solve the problem, we start with the equilibrium:

\[
\text{CO}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightleftarrows \text{H}_3\text{O}^+ + \text{HCO}_3^-
\]

The acid dissociation constant is given as \( K_a = 4.3 \times 10^{-7} \), and the pH is 7.40. The goal is to find the ratio of bicarbonate (\(\text{HCO}_3^-\)) to carbon dioxide (\(\text{CO}_2\)) concentrations, i.e., \([\text{HCO}_3^-]/[\text{CO}_2]\).

The \( K_a \) expression for this equilibrium is:

\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}_3\text{O}^+][\text{HCO}_3^-]}{[\text{CO}_2]}
\]

Rearranging to solve for the ratio \([\text{HCO}_3^-]/[\text{CO}_2]\), we get:

\[
\frac{[\text{HCO}_3^-]}{[\text{CO}_2]} = \frac{K_a}{[\text{H}_3\text{O}^+]}
\]

The concentration of \([\text{H}_3\text{O}^+]\) can be calculated from the pH using the relationship \([\text{H}_3\text{O}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}}\). Substituting \(\text{pH} = 7.40\):

\[
[\text{H}_3\text{O}^+] = 10^{-7.40} \approx 3.98 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]

Now substitute \( K_a = 4.3 \times 10^{-7} \) and \([\text{H}_3\text{O}^+] \approx 4.0 \times 10^{-8}\) into the equation:

\[
\frac{[\text{HCO}_3^-]}{[\text{CO}_2]} = \frac{4.3 \times 10^{-7}}{4.0 \times 10^{-8}} = \frac{4.3}{4.0} \times \frac{10^{-7}}{10^{-8}} = 1.075 \times 10 = 10.75
\]

Thus, the ratio of \([\text{HCO}_3^-]\) to \([\text{CO}_2]\) is approximately 10.75. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B: 10.75**
