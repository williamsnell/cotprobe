Question:

A contractor learned that a city intended to open a new grammar school and was going to ask for bids to construct the school. The contractor decided to submit a bid to do the construction. The contractor contacted all of the subcontractors she had worked with in the past, informed them of the specifics of the school construction project, and asked each to submit a bid for the work they would be requested to perform. An insulation company submitted a bid of $25,000 to do the required insulation work in the new school. Based on that and other subcontract bids, the contractor prepared a general bid and submitted it to the city. Three days after the contractor submitted the bid to the city, the insulation company notified the contractor that it had overbooked its workforce and would be unable to perform the insulation work. The next day, the city notified the contractor that she had won the bid to build the school. The contractor was forced to find another company to do the insulation work. The other company charged the contractor $30,000 to do the insulation. Which of the following arguments best supports the claim for $5,000 by the contractor against the insulation company?

Options:

A: An option contract was created, because the contractor used the insulation company's bid in computing the bid it submitted to the city and notified the insulation company of that fact.
B: The contractor had made an offer to the insulation company that the latter accepted when it submitted its bid.
C: The contractor had the right to rely on the insulation company's bid in calculating its own bid to the city.
D: The insulation company's bid was a firm offer that it could not withdraw without the contractor's agreement.
E: The contractor and the insulation company had a valid contract that the insulation company breached by failing to perform the work.
F: The insulation company had made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the insulation company's bid in computing the bid it submitted to the city.
G: The insulation company had a duty to honor its bid because the contractor had relied on it in good faith.
H: The insulation company breached a contract when it failed to perform the insulation work.
I: The contractor suffered damages as a direct result of the insulation company's failure to perform the agreed work.
J: The insulation company's bid was an offer that it was obligated to hold open, because the insulation company and the contractor were merchants.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

So, the scenario is about a contractor who's bidding to build a school. She contacts subcontractors, including an insulation company, who gives her a bid of $25,000. She uses that bid in her own calculations and submits her general bid to the city. Then, three days later, the insulation company says they can't do the job because they're overbooked. The city then awards the contract to her, and she has to find another company that charges $30,000. She wants to claim the $5,000 difference from the insulation company.

The question is asking which argument best supports her claim. The options are A through J.

Hmm. I remember that in contract law, when someone makes a bid, it's usually an offer. But in business contexts, sometimes there are exceptions. For example, in the case of Drennan v. Star Paving Co., it was held that a subcontractor's bid can be considered a firm offer if the general contractor relies on it. I think this is under the "detrimental reliance" theory, which can make an offer irrevocable even without consideration.

So, in this case, the insulation company gave a bid, which is an offer. Normally, offers can be revoked unless there's consideration for an option or if it's a firm offer under certain statutes, like the UCC for merchants. But the contractor here used that bid in her own bid to the city, which constitutes reliance.

Wait, but the question is about which argument supports the contractor's claim for $5,000. So, the key here is probably that the insulation company's bid was a firm offer that they couldn't revoke because the contractor relied on it. Or maybe that there was a contract formed because of the reliance.

Looking at the options:

Option A says an option contract was created because the contractor used the bid and notified the insulation company. But I don't think an option contract requires notification unless it's under the option contract rules, which usually require consideration. So maybe not A.

Option B says the contractor made an offer which the insulation company accepted by submitting the bid. Wait, no, the insulation company submitted the bid first, which was an offer. So the contractor would be the offeree. So B is probably wrong because it reverses the roles.

Option C states the contractor had the right to rely on the insulation's bid in calculating her own. This sounds like the reliance theory, which would make the offer irrevocable. So this could be a good option.

Option D says the insulation's bid was a firm offer that couldn't be withdrawn without agreement. That would be the case if the insulation company is a merchant and under UCC, their offers are firm for a certain period. But the question doesn't specify if they're merchants. So D might apply only if they are, but the question doesn't say that.

Option E claims a valid contract existed that was breached. But for a contract, there needs to be acceptance. The contractor didn't accept the insulation company's offer yet. She just used the bid in her own bid. So unless she accepted, there's no contract. So E is probably incorrect.

Option F says the insulation made an offer which the contractor accepted by using the bid. But using the bid in computing her own bid isn't an acceptance. Acceptance would be if she said, "I accept your bid, let's do the work." So F is incorrect.

Option G argues the insulation had a duty because the contractor relied in good faith. This aligns with the promissory estoppel doctrine. Promissory estoppel says that if someone makes a promise that the other party relies on to their detriment, the promise can be enforced even without consideration. So this might be the case here.

Option H says they breached a contract by failing to perform. Again, if there was no contract, this wouldn't apply. So H is likely wrong.

Option I says the contractor had damages as a result of failure to perform agreed work. Again, this implies a contract existed, which I don't think it did. So I is probably wrong.

Option J says the insulation's bid was an offer they had to keep open because they are merchants. This refers to UCC 2-205, which makes firm offers irrevocable for a certain period. But unless the insulation company is a merchant, this wouldn't apply. The question doesn't specify if they're merchants, so J might not be the best choice unless we can assume they are in the business, which is possible. But the question doesn't state that, so maybe J is a stretch.

So putting it together, the strongest argument would be under promissory estoppel, which is option C or G. Wait, option C says the contractor had the right to rely on the bid in calculating her own. Option G says the insulation had a duty to honor because the contractor relied in good faith.

Wait, I think the correct doctrine here is promissory estoppel, which prevents the offeror from revoking the offer if the offeree relied on it. So the insulation company's offer couldn't be revoked because the contractor relied on it to her detriment (by submitting a bid based on it). So the argument would be that the insulation company is bound by their offer because of the reliance, making their withdrawal a breach.

Looking back at the options, option C says the contractor had the right to rely, which is part of promissory estoppel. Option G says the insulation had a duty because of reliance. So which option aligns with this?

Option C: The contractor had the right to rely on the insulation company's bid in calculating her own bid.

Yes, that's the basis for promissory estoppel. So the contractor can argue that the insulation company's bid was irrevocable because she relied on it, and the company is now liable for the damages caused by revoking it.

Alternatively, option D suggests it's a firm offer. But D would require that the offer is firm without needing reliance, perhaps under UCC. But without knowing if they are merchants, D might not apply.

So the best argument is option C, which supports the claim based on reliance, making the offer irrevocable under promissory estoppel.

The scenario involves a contractor who relied on an insulation company's bid to calculate her own bid for a school construction project. After the contractor submitted her bid, the insulation company withdrew its offer, forcing the contractor to find a more expensive alternative. The question asks which argument best supports the contractor's claim for the $5,000 difference.

In contract law, a subcontractor's bid is typically considered an offer. Normally, offers can be revoked unless they are made irrevocable through consideration (e.g., an option contract) or under specific doctrines like promissory estoppel. Promissory estoppel applies when the offeror's promise is relied upon by the offeree to their detriment, making the offer irrevocable. This doctrine is central to the contractor's claim, as she relied on the insulation company's bid to submit her own bid.

**Analysis of the options:**

- **Option A:** Incorrect. An option contract requires consideration, which is not mentioned here.
- **Option B:** Incorrect. The insulation company's bid was the offer, and the contractor did not accept it by using it in her bid.
- **Option C:** Correct. This aligns with promissory estoppel, as the contractor had the right to rely on the insulation company's bid, making it irrevocable due to her detrimental reliance.
- **Option D:** Potentially correct if the insulation company is a merchant under UCC 2-205, but the question does not specify this.
- **Option E:** Incorrect. No contract was formed, as the contractor did not accept the insulation company's offer.
- **Option F:** Incorrect. Using the bid in her own bid does not constitute acceptance.
- **Option G:** Close, but less precise than Option C. While it mentions reliance, Option C directly addresses the right to rely, which is the basis for promissory estoppel.
- **Option H:** Incorrect. No contract existed, so there was no breach of contract.
- **Option I:** Incorrect. This assumes a contractual relationship, which did not exist.
- **Option J:** Potentially correct if the insulation company is a merchant, but this is not stated in the question.

The strongest argument is that the insulation company's bid became irrevocable because the contractor relied on it to her detriment, as stated in Option C. This aligns with the doctrine of promissory estoppel, which prevents the insulation company from revoking its offer under these circumstances.

**Answer: C**
