Question:

A woman owns a tract of land located in a state in the Midwest. On June 1, 2005, the woman sells to a husband and wife an undivided one-half interest in this land for $100,000 (the entire consideration being paid by the husband). The deed to the husband and wife reads as follows: "To (husband) and (wife) and their heirs as tenants by the entirety, and not as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common. "On June 1, 2006, the woman sells her remaining interest in the tract of land to the husband and his brother for $125,000 (the husband pays $80,000 of the purchase price, and the brother pays the balance). The deed to the husband and the brother provides: "To (the husband) and (the brother) and their heirs as joint tenants and not as tenants in common. "The husband conveys to his cousin all his right, title, and interest under the two deeds from the woman. The husband then dies. The brother then dies. The cousin is thus the owner of

Options:

Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down the problem.

First, the scenario involves a woman who owns a tract of land. She sells parts of it in two separate transactions, and then there's a conveyance by the husband to his cousin, followed by the deaths of the husband and brother. The question is about what interest the cousin ends up owning.

Let me outline the facts to make it clearer.

1. **First Sale (June 1, 2005):** The woman sells an undivided one-half interest to a husband and wife. The deed says they take it as tenants by the entirety, not as joint tenants or tenants in common. The entire $100,000 was paid by the husband.

2. **Second Sale (June 1, 2006):** The woman sells her remaining interest (which would be the other half, since she sold half before) to the husband and his brother. The deed here states they take as joint tenants. The husband pays $80,000, and the brother pays $45,000 (since total is $125,000).

3. **Conveyance by Husband:** The husband then conveys all his rights under both deeds to his cousin. After that, the husband dies, and then the brother dies. The question is, what does the cousin own now?

Hmm. So I need to figure out the interests each person had before the conveyance and then how it transfers.

Let me think about the first sale. The woman sold a 1/2 interest to the husband and wife as tenants by the entirety. Tenancy by the entirety is a form of joint ownership, but it's only available to a husband and wife. It's like a joint tenancy but with the unique right of survivorship between spouses. So when one dies, the other gets the entire interest.

Wait, but in this case, the husband and wife are each alive when the husband later conveys his interest. So after the first sale, the woman has a 1/2 interest left. Then she sells that to the husband and his brother as joint tenants.

Wait, joint tenants have the right of survivorship. So when one joint tenant dies, the other gets their share. But in this scenario, the husband conveys his interest to his cousin before he dies. So in the second sale, the husband and brother are joint tenants on the remaining half, right?

Wait, no. Let's clarify. The first sale is for 1/2 of the land. The second sale is for the remaining 1/2. So the first 1/2 is held by the husband and wife as tenants by the entirety. The second 1/2 is held by the husband and brother as joint tenants.

Wait no, not exactly. Because when the woman sells to the husband and wife, she's selling a 1/2 interest. So after that, she has a 1/2 interest left. Then she sells that 1/2 to the husband and brother as joint tenants. So that means the husband and brother each have a 25% interest each, but as joint tenants, so together they own 50% as joint tenants.

Wait, no. Wait, if two people are joint tenants of a 1/2 interest, does each have a 25% undivided interest? Or do they together own the 50% as joint tenants, meaning each owns an equal share, but as a joint tenancy, so each has a 25% interest, but if one dies, the other gets their 25%?

Wait, no. Let me think again. If two people are joint tenants of a 50% interest, each has an equal share, so 25% each, but under joint tenancy, they each have a right of survivorship. So if one dies, the other gets the entire 50% share in that joint tenancy. But wait, no, if they are joint tenants, they each have an equal undivided interest, and when one dies, the survivor gets the entire 50% interest.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the ownership structure step by step.

After the first sale (2005), the ownership is:

- Husband and wife: 50% as tenants by the entirety.

- Woman still owns 50%.

Then, in 2006, the woman sells her remaining 50% to the husband and brother as joint tenants. So the 50% is now owned by husband and brother as joint tenants. So each of them has a 25% interest, but as joint tenants, so upon the death of one, the other gets the entire 50%.

But wait, the husband is already part of the first tenancy with his wife. So the overall ownership after both sales would be:

- From the first sale: husband and wife own 50% as tenants by the entirety.

- From the second sale: husband and brother own 50% as joint tenants.

Wait no, no. Wait, the second sale is 50% of the entire land. So the husband and brother each have a 25% interest in the entire land, but as joint tenants. So when the husband dies, the brother would get the husband's 25%, making the brother own 50% in that joint tenancy.

Wait, maybe I should represent this as a table.

After the first sale:

- Woman: 50% (undivided).

- Husband and wife: 50% as tenants by entirety.

Then, after the second sale (2006), the woman's 50% is sold to husband and brother as joint tenants. So:

- Husband and wife: 50% as tenants by entirety.

- Husband and brother: 50% as joint tenants.

Wait, but the husband is now part of two different co-ownership arrangements. So the husband, in effect, has two separate interests: one as tenant by entirety with his wife (which is a 50% share), and another as joint tenant with his brother (which is a 25% share, since the 50% is split equally between them as joint tenants).

Wait, no. Wait, the 50% from the second sale is owned by both the husband and brother as joint tenants, so each has a 25% interest in the entire property.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The second sale is for the woman's remaining 50% interest. She sells it to husband and brother as joint tenants, which means that together they own 50% of the property, and as joint tenants, each has a 25% interest. So, the husband gets a 25% interest, and the brother gets a 25% interest, but as joint tenants, so if one dies, the other gets the entire 50%.

But wait, the husband already has a 50% interest as tenant by the entirety with his wife. So the husband's total interest is 50% (from the first sale) plus 25% (from the second sale). So 75%?

Wait, no, because the first sale's 50% is owned by the husband and wife as tenants by the entirety. So, in that, each has a 25% interest, but as tenants by entirety, they can't unilaterally convey their interest. So the husband can't sell his 25% share from the first sale without the wife's consent.

But in the second sale, the husband and brother each have a 25% interest as joint tenants. So the husband's total interest is 25% (from the second sale) because in the first sale, he and his wife together own 50%, but individually, each has a 25% interest, but they are held as tenants by entirety. So the husband's individual interest from the first sale is 25%, but he can't dispose of it without his wife's consent.

Wait, but in the problem, the husband conveys "all his right, title, and interest under the two deeds from the woman." So that includes both his interest from the first sale and the second sale.

Wait, but in the first sale, the husband and wife received the 50% as tenants by the entirety. So the deed was to both of them, so the husband's interest is as a tenant by entirety. But I'm not sure if he can convey his interest in that without the wife's consent. Because in a tenancy by entirety, neither spouse can convey their interest without the other's consent. So if the husband tries to convey his interest, the wife might have to agree, otherwise it's not possible.

Wait, but the problem says the husband conveys all his right, title, and interest under the two deeds. So perhaps the first deed (the tenancy by entirety) and the second deed (joint tenancy with brother) are both from the woman to the husband and others. So the husband's interest under both deeds is being conveyed to the cousin.

But wait, in the first deed, the husband and wife are tenants by entirety, so the husband's interest is 25% (but as part of the entirety). So can he convey that without the wife's consent? Or does the tenancy by entirety prevent that?

Wait, in a tenancy by entirety, each spouse has an undivided right to the entire property, but they can't alienate their interest without the other's consent. So if the husband tries to transfer his interest, the wife would have to agree. But the problem doesn't mention the wife's involvement in this conveyance. So perhaps the husband's conveyance of his interest in the first deed is ineffective because he can't convey without the wife's consent.

Hmm, that complicates things. If the husband can't convey his interest from the first sale, then the cousin only gets his interest from the second sale. Let's explore both possibilities.

First, assuming the husband can convey both interests. Then, the cousin gets:

- From the first deed: the husband's 25% interest as tenant by entirety. But that's only possible if the wife consents, which she didn't in the problem. So perhaps that part of the conveyance is invalid, and the cousin only gets the husband's interest from the second deed.

Alternatively, if the conveyance is valid, then the cousin would get both the 25% from the first sale and the 25% from the second sale, totaling 50%, but that seems unlikely because the husband can't convey the first part without the wife's consent.

So perhaps the cousin only gets the husband's 25% from the second sale.

Wait, but let's think again. The first deed is to the husband and wife as tenants by entirety. So if the husband tries to convey his interest, he can't do so because in a tenancy by entirety, the spouses can't separately convey their interest without the other's consent. Therefore, the husband's conveyance to the cousin of his interest under the first deed is ineffective. So the cousin only acquires the husband's interest under the second deed.

In the second deed, the husband and brother are joint tenants of a 50% interest, each holding a 25% share. So when the husband conveys his 25% to the cousin, the cousin now owns that 25%. But since it's a joint tenancy, if the husband dies, the brother would get the husband's share, but in this case, the husband has already conveyed it to the cousin.

Wait, no. Joint tenancy has the right of survivorship, which applies upon death. But if the husband conveys his interest before dying, then the joint tenancy is severed as to his interest, and it becomes a tenancy in common between the cousin and the brother, I think.

Wait, when a joint tenant conveys their interest, the joint tenancy is severed, and the conveyed interest becomes a tenancy in common with the remaining joint tenant.

So, in the second deed, the husband and brother are joint tenants of 50% (each 25%). The husband conveys his 25% to the cousin, so now the cousin owns 25%, and the brother still owns 25%, but now as tenants in common, not joint tenants.

Then, the husband dies. But he had already conveyed his 25% to the cousin, so his death doesn't affect that 25%—it's already gone. Then the brother dies. The brother's 25% would pass to his heirs, but in the problem, it's not stated. Wait, but the brother's ownership is as a joint tenant initially, but after the husband conveyed his share, the brother's 25% would remain.

Wait, in the second deed, the initial ownership after the sale is husband (25%) and brother (25%) as joint tenants. When the husband conveys his 25% to the cousin, the joint tenancy is severed, so now the cousin and brother are tenants in common, each owning 25% of the 50% that was the joint tenancy. So the overall ownership is:

- From the first sale: husband and wife own 50% as tenants by entirety.

- From the second sale: cousin owns 25%, brother owns 25% as tenants in common.

Wait, but the husband's conveyance of his 25% to the cousin would mean that the cousin now owns 25% of the entire property, and the brother owns 25% as well, with the husband and wife owning 50%.

But wait, the husband's ownership from the second sale was 25%, which he conveyed, so after that, the cousin has 25%, and the brother has 25%, each as tenants in common in that 50%.

Now, when the husband dies, his interest in the first sale (50% as tenant by entirety) passes to the wife via the right of survivorship. So the wife now owns 50% by entirety.

Then, the brother dies. The brother owned 25% of the entire property as a tenant in common. So upon his death, his 25% would pass to his heirs, but the problem doesn't mention any heirs conveying to the cousin. So the cousin only has the 25% from the husband's conveyance.

Wait, but the problem says the husband conveys his interest under both deeds to the cousin. So if the first deed's conveyance is invalid, then the cousin only gets the second deed's 25%. But if the conveyance was valid for both, which it's not because the first deed's interest can't be conveyed without the wife's consent, then the cousin only gets the 25%.

So, after all, the cousin ends up with a 25% interest as tenant in common with the brother's heirs (assuming the brother died, but the problem says the brother dies, but doesn't say who inherits his 25%). Wait, the problem says the cousin is the owner after the husband and brother die, so perhaps the cousin's 25% is secure, but the brother's 25% would go to his estate, but since it's not mentioned, perhaps it's assumed that the cousin doesn't get that part.

Wait, but the problem states that the husband conveys all his interest in both deeds to the cousin. So if the first deed's interest can't be conveyed, then the cousin only gets the second deed's 25%. Then, when the husband dies, the wife gets the 50% from the first deed. The brother, upon his death, his 25% would go to his heirs or next of kin, but the problem doesn't say the cousin inherits that. So the cousin only has 25%, and the wife has 50%, and the brother's heirs have 25%.

Wait, but the options given don't include 25%. Looking at the options:

A: 1/5 (20%)

B: 1/4 (25%)

C: no interest

D: 2/3

E: 3/5

F: 1/6

G: entire

H: 1/3

I: 3/4

So option B is 25%, which would be the case if the cousin only gets the second deed's interest. But wait, let me reconsider.

Wait, after the husband conveys his 25% from the second deed, the cousin has 25%. The husband then dies, but he had already conveyed that 25%, so his death doesn't affect the cousin's 25%. Then the brother dies. The brother's 25% would pass to his heirs, but the cousin isn't mentioned to inherit that. So the cousin's interest remains at 25%, which is option B.

But wait, let's think again about the initial ownership. After the first sale, the husband and wife own 50% as tenants by entirety. The second sale, the husband and brother own 50% as joint tenants. The husband then conveys his 25% (from the second sale) to the cousin. So the cousin now owns 25%, and the brother owns 25% as tenants in common. The husband and wife own 50%, but upon the husband's death, the wife gets the 50% entirely.

So after all deaths, the ownership is:

- Wife: 50% (as sole owner after husband's death in the tenancy by entirety).

- Cousin: 25%.

- Brother's estate or heirs: 25%.

But the question is about what the cousin owns, which is 25%, so option B.

Wait, but the problem says the husband conveys all his interest under both deeds. If the first deed's interest can't be conveyed, then the cousin only gets the second. But if somehow the first deed's interest can be, perhaps the cousin gets more.

Wait, but in the first deed, the husband's interest is as tenant by entirety, so he can't convey it without the wife's consent. Therefore, the cousin only gets the 25% from the second deed. So the answer would be B: undivided one-quarter interest.

Wait, but let me check for any other possibilities. Let's say the husband's conveyance to the cousin includes both his 25% from the second deed and his 25% from the first deed. But can he convey the first deed's interest?

No, because in a tenancy by entirety, the husband can't convey his interest without the wife's consent. Therefore, the conveyance of the first deed's interest is ineffective. So the cousin only gets the second deed's 25%.

Therefore, the cousin ends up with a 25% interest, which is option B.

The question involves the ownership of a tract of land after a series of transactions and deaths. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Sale (June 1, 2005):** The woman sells an undivided 50% interest to the husband and wife as tenants by the entirety. In a tenancy by the entirety, the husband and wife each have an undivided 25% interest in the property, but neither can convey their interest without the other's consent.

2. **Second Sale (June 1, 2006):** The woman sells her remaining 50% interest to the husband and his brother as joint tenants. As joint tenants, the husband and brother each have a 25% interest in the property. Joint tenancy includes the right of survivorship, meaning that if one joint tenant dies, the other inherits their share.

3. **Husband's Conveyance:** The husband conveys "all his right, title, and interest under the two deeds" to his cousin. However:
   - The husband's interest in the first sale (
