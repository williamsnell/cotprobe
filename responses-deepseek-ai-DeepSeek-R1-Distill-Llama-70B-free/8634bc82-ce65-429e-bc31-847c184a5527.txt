Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the acid-test ratio for ABC Plumbing. Hmm, I remember that the acid-test ratio is a liquidity ratio that helps determine if a company can pay its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

I think the acid-test ratio, also known as the quick ratio, is calculated by dividing the quick assets by the current liabilities. Quick assets usually include cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. They exclude inventory because it's not as liquid. So that makes sense because the question provides those figures.

Looking at the data given: Cash is $7,300, Marketable Securities are $14,200, and Accounts Receivable is $2,120. So I need to add those together for the numerator. Let me do that math. 7,300 plus 14,200 is 21,500, and then add 2,120, which brings it to 23,620. So the quick assets are $23,620.

Now the denominator is the current liabilities. The question lists Notes Payable as $1,400 and Accounts Payable as $1,850. So adding those together, 1,400 plus 1,850 equals $3,250. That's the total current liabilities.

So the acid-test ratio is quick assets divided by current liabilities. That would be 23,620 divided by 3,250. Let me compute that. Hmm, 23,620 ÷ 3,250. I can simplify this by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10 first, so 2,362 ÷ 325.

Let me do the division step by step. 325 goes into 2,362 how many times? Well, 325 times 7 is 2,275. Subtracting that from 2,362 gives 87. Bring down a zero (treating it as 870). 325 goes into 870 two times (2x325=650). Subtracting that leaves 220. Bring down another zero, making it 2200. 325 goes into 2200 six times (6x325=1950). Subtract to get 250. Bring down a zero to make 2500. 325 goes into 2500 seven times (7x325=2275). Subtract to get 225. Bring down a zero, making it 2250. 325 goes into that six times (6x325=1950), leaving 300. Hmm, but this is getting a bit tedious. Maybe I can use a calculator approach.

Wait, alternatively, I can compute 23,620 ÷ 3,250. Let's see: 3,250 x 7 = 22,750. Subtract that from 23,620: 23,620-22,750=870. Now, 870 divided by 3,250 is 0.268 (since 3,250 x 0.268 is 870). So adding the 7 and 0.268 gives 7.268. Rounding that to the nearest hundredth would be 7.27.

Wait, let me double-check that. 3,250 * 7.27 = let's compute that. 3,250 *7=22,750; 3,250 *0.27=877.5. Adding 22,750 and 877.5 gives 23,627.5. Oh wait, the quick assets are 23,620, which is slightly less than 23,627.5. So maybe the actual ratio is a bit less than 7.27. But when I compute 23,620 ÷ 3,250, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.

Let me try another approach. 3,250 times 7 is 22,750. 23,620 minus 22,750 is 870. So 870 divided by 3,250 equals approximately 0.2676 (since 3,250 * 0.2676 ≈ 870). So the total is 7.2676, which is approximately 7.27 when rounded to the nearest hundredth.

Looking at the options, option G is 7.27 and option A is 8.27. So the correct answer must be G.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial calculation. Quick assets: 7,300 +14,200 =21,500 +2,120 =23,620. Current liabilities: 1,400 +1,850 =3,250. 23,620 ÷3,250=7.268... which rounds to 7.27. So yes, the correct answer is G.

The acid-test ratio is calculated by dividing quick assets (cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable) by current liabilities. 

For ABC Plumbing:
- **Quick Assets**:  
  Cash = $7,300  
  Marketable Securities = $14,200  
  Accounts Receivable = $2,120  
  Total Quick Assets = $7,300 + $14,200 + $2,120 = **$23,620**

- **Current Liabilities**:  
  Notes Payable = $1,400  
  Accounts Payable = $1,850  
  Total Current Liabilities = $1,400 + $1,850 = **$3,250**

The acid-test ratio is:  
\[
\text{Acid-Test Ratio} = \frac{\text{Quick Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}} = \frac{23,620}{3,250} \approx 7.27
\]

Rounding to the nearest hundredth, the acid-test ratio is **7.27**. Among the options provided, the correct answer is **G**.
