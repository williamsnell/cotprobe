Question:

A buyer contracted in writing to purchase 1,000 gidgets (which are similar to widgets but are more popular because of their greater durability and- resiliency) from a manufacturer for a total contract price of $4,000. After this agreement was executed and before delivery, the buyer and the manufacturer agreed in a telephone conversation to change the quantity term from 1,000 to 800 gidgets. This modification is probably unenforceable, because

Options:

A: it violates the statute of frauds.
B: there was no consideration.
C: the original contract was in writing.
D: the parol evidence rule bars contradictory terms.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically dealing with modifications of contracts. Hmm, I remember that contracts can sometimes be modified, but there are certain rules about how that can happen. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about a buyer who contracted to purchase 1,000 gidgets for $4,000. After the contract was made, they had a phone conversation where they agreed to change the quantity to 800 gidgets. Now, the question is why this modification might be unenforceable.

The options are A through D. Let me go through each one.

Option A says it violates the statute of frauds. I recall that the statute of frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. For example, contracts for goods over a certain value typically need to be in writing. But wait, the original contract was already in writing. The modification here is a change in quantity, but I'm not sure if that affects the statute of frauds. Maybe if the modification brings it under the threshold, but the original was for $4,000, and changing to 800 might reduce the price. Let me think, the statute of frauds usually applies to the original contract, not necessarily modifications, unless the modification is about something else like land or suretyship. So maybe A isn't the correct reason here.

Option B is that there was no consideration. Ah, consideration is crucial for contract modifications. Under common law, a modification needs new consideration to be binding. But wait, I remember something about the pre-existing duty rule. If both parties agree to modify a contract, but there's no additional consideration beyond their original duties, the modification isn't enforceable. In this case, the buyer and manufacturer just agreed to change the quantity. Was there any new consideration? The buyer is reducing the number, so maybe the manufacturer is losing revenue. But did the buyer offer something extra, like a higher price per gidget? If not, maybe there's no consideration, making the modification unenforceable. That could be B.

Option C says the original contract was in writing. I remember that a written contract can be modified by a subsequent agreement, whether written or oral, unless the original contract specifies that modifications must be in writing. The question doesn't say anything about the original contract requiring modifications to be in writing. So just because the original was written doesn't automatically make the modification unenforceable. So C might not be the right answer.

Option D is about the parol evidence rule barring contradictory terms. Parol evidence deals with prior or contemporaneous agreements contradicting a written contract. But here, it's a subsequent modification, not prior. So the parol evidence rule wouldn't apply here. D doesn't seem right.

Wait, but some jurisdictions have rules about modifications. Under the UCC, which governs sales of goods, there's a different approach. The UCC allows for modifications without consideration as long as they're made in good faith. But wait, this might be a trick. The UCC (Article 2) indeed says that a contract for the sale of goods can be modified without additional consideration as long as it's done in good faith. So in that case, the modification would be enforceable, unless the original contract had a no-oral-modification clause.

Hold on, the original contract was in writing, but did it include a provision that any modifications must be in writing? The question doesn't say that. So under UCC ยง 2-209(2), a modification doesn't require consideration if it's in good faith. So if that's the case, then the lack of consideration (option B) wouldn't make the modification unenforceable. But wait, the question is about why it's unenforceable. So if the UCC applies, the modification is enforceable, but if common law applies, it's not without consideration.

Wait, but the UCC applies to goods, and gidgets are goods. So according to UCC, the modification should be okay as long as in good faith, even without consideration. So the reason the modification is unenforceable wouldn't be B. So then why is the answer B?

Wait, perhaps the question is set outside the UCC context, or perhaps it's a common law question. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the rules. Let me think again.

Under common law, to modify a contract, there must be consideration. So if the parties just agree to change terms without anything extra, it's not enforceable. But under UCC, consideration isn't required for modifications of goods contracts, as long as done in good faith. So the answer depends on whether this is a common law or UCC situation.

The question says it's a contract for the sale of goods (gidgets, which are similar to widgets, so they're goods). So UCC applies. Then the modification is enforceable without consideration. So why is the answer B? Hmm. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing on the pre-existing duty rule, but under the UCC, that's not a bar. So the absence of consideration wouldn't make it unenforceable. So the answer can't be B. Then why is the modification unenforceable?

Wait, perhaps the modification would require consideration unless under the UCC, but if the contract was for over $500, the statute of frauds requires a writing. The original contract was for $4,000, so it's covered by the SoF. If they modify it to 800 gidgets, the price per would be $5, making 800 x $5 = $4,000. Wait, no, original was 1,000 for $4,000, so $4 each. If they reduce to 800, same total, so $5 each. So the new contract is still for $4,000, which is over the SoF threshold, so a written modification might be needed. But the original contract was in writing, and the modification was oral. Wait, the SoF requires contracts for goods over $500 to be in writing. But the modification is an oral agreement. So if the modification is about the quantity, which affects the price, but the total remains over $500, does the SoF apply to the modification? Or does the original written contract suffice?

I think the SoF requires the original contract to be in writing. The modification, even if oral, doesn't need to be in writing unless the modification itself is a new contract that would fall under the SoF. But the original contract was already in writing, so maybe the oral modification is okay because the original was written. So SoF might not be the issue here.

Wait, the modification doesn't create a new contract; it's just a change to the existing one. So the SoF doesn't apply to the modification itself because the original contract was already in compliance. So A wouldn't be the correct answer.

Wait, but under the SoF, any contract for goods over $500 must be in writing. So if the original contract was written, and the modification is oral, but the modified contract is still for over $500, the modification itself doesn't need to be in writing because it's not a new contract. So A is not correct.

So going back, the modification was oral, but under UCC, that's okay. But if the original contract had a clause requiring modifications to be in writing, then the oral mod wouldn't be allowed. But the question doesn't mention such a clause. So C isn't the answer.

Hmm, so if the modification is enforceable under UCC without consideration, then why is the question saying it's probably unenforceable? Because the options are suggesting that the reason is B, no consideration. But under UCC, that's not necessary. Unless the question is set outside UCC, but the question says it's about goods, so UCC applies.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The UCC allows modifications without consideration, but if the modification is a reduction in quantity, perhaps the buyer is trying to lower their obligation. But the manufacturer might not have agreed to that without something in return. Oh, but under UCC 2-209, the modification is allowed in good faith without consideration. So the absence of consideration isn't a bar. So the modification should be enforceable, meaning the answer isn't B. So why is the question saying it's unenforceable?

Wait, perhaps the question is tricking me. Let me check the options again. Oh, maybe I'm confusing the pre-existing duty rule. Under common law, a modification without consideration is unenforceable. But the UCC says that's not required. So if the exam question is testing common law, then B would be the answer. But if it's testing UCC, then the modification is enforceable, making B incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about the enforceability of the modification. If it's under UCC, the modification is enforceable without consideration. So the answer shouldn't be B. But the options are given, and the question says it's probably unenforceable. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the contract was within the statute of frauds, and the modification is oral. But the modification doesn't need to be in writing if the original contract was in writing. Wait, no, the SoF requires the contract to be in writing, but modifications can be oral. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that a modification to a written contract must also be in writing to be enforceable. But under UCC, that's not the case. Unless the original contract specifies that any modifications must be in writing, which the question doesn't say. So in that case, the oral modification is okay.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what the question is asking. It says the modification is probably unenforceable because... So the answer should be B: no consideration.

But under UCC, that's not a problem. So perhaps the question is not considering UCC, and is instead under common law.

Wait, but the UCC applies to the sale of goods, and the question is about gidgets, which are goods. So the UCC should apply. Therefore, the modification should be enforceable even without consideration, making B incorrect.

Hmm, but the question says the modification is probably unenforceable. So perhaps the intended answer is B, but I'm getting confused because under UCC, that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the question is trying to say that because the contract was in writing, any modification must also be in writing. But that's not the case unless the contract says so. So option C is incorrect.

Wait, another angle: the original contract was for 1,000 gidgets. The modification reduces it to 800. If the contract was for a quantity term, perhaps under the UCC, when a buyer reduces the quantity, the seller can refuse, but if they agree, it's allowed. But without consideration, under common law, it's not allowed.

Wait, maybe the question is considering that the modification is a substitution of a new contract, requiring consideration.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B because in the absence of consideration, the modification isn't binding, but under UCC, that's not required. So I'm getting stuck.

Wait, maybe the answer is A, statute of frauds. Let me think again. The original contract was in writing, satisfying the SoF. The modification is oral, but the SoF doesn't require the modification to be in writing. So A isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B because under common law, modifications require consideration, but under UCC, they don't. So the question might be testing the common law approach.

But since this is a sales contract, UCC applies. So the answer shouldn't be B.

Wait, maybe I'm missing another point. The UCC allows modifications without consideration, but if the modification is unilateral, it might not be allowed. But in this case, both parties agreed, so it's a bilateral modification.

Hmm, perhaps the question is a trick, and the correct answer is B because the modification lacks consideration, but under UCC, that's not an issue. But the question says it's unenforceable, so perhaps the intended answer is B, assuming common law applies.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me recap: the contract is for the sale of goods, so UCC applies. Under UCC, modifications don't require consideration as long as in good faith. So the modification should be enforceable, meaning B isn't the correct reason for it being unenforceable.

But the question states the modification is probably unenforceable. So perhaps the answer isn't B. Maybe it's A? No, because the original contract was written, and the modification doesn't need to be written under SoF.

Wait, another thought: the parol evidence rule (option D) applies to prior agreements, not subsequent modifications, so D isn't correct.

So the only option left is B, but under UCC, that's not correct. Unless the question is considering the common law approach. Maybe the question is not under UCC, but I thought gidgets are goods.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to common law, not UCC. Maybe I should consider that. If it's common law, then yes, B would be correct because without consideration, the modification isn't binding.

But the UCC applies to goods. Hmm. I'm a bit confused. Maybe the correct answer is B because they're testing the common law principle, not UCC.

Alternatively, perhaps the original contract was a written, fully integrated contract, and the modification is oral. But under the UCC, that's allowed. So I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is B because without consideration, under common law, the modification isn't enforceable. But since it's a sale of goods, UCC applies, so the answer shouldn't be B. But the question is saying it's unenforceable, so perhaps the intended answer is B.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is B because the question is testing the common law rule, assuming that the UCC's exception isn't considered here.

I think the intended answer is B, because the question says the modification is probably unenforceable, and under common law, that's because there's no consideration. But under UCC, it's enforceable. But perhaps the question is designed to test common law, not UCC.

Alternatively, perhaps the contract falls under the UCC, and the answer is not B, making the question's premise incorrect, but since the question says it's unenforceable, perhaps the intended answer is B.

Wait, but the UCC is pretty clear on this. So maybe the question is wrong, but I have to choose from the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about what the bar exam would expect. In many bar exam questions, when dealing with sale of goods, UCC applies. So the lack of consideration isn't a problem. Thus, the modification is enforceable, so the answer can't be B.

But the question says it's unenforceable, so perhaps I'm missing something else. Alternatively, maybe the modification is a reduction in quantity, which under the UCC could be a breach if the seller doesn't agree. Wait, but the parties did agree in the phone call. So the modification is allowed.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the modification must be in writing if it's a change in the quantity term, but under the UCC, that's not required unless the contract specifies it.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to make a decision. The question states that the modification is unenforceable. The options are A to D.

If the modification is oral and under the UCC, it's enforceable, so B isn't the reason. If it's under common law, B is correct. But since this is a sale of goods, UCC applies, so the answer shouldn't be B. But the question says it's unenforceable, which would suggest B is the answer, but that would be incorrect under UCC.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the original contract was for $4,000, so the modification to 800 at the same price per unit (assuming same total) is acceptable under UCC, but perhaps without consideration, it's not binding. But under UCC, that's not required.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B because the question is testing common law, not UCC.

Wait, maybe I should think about the pre-existing duty rule again. Under common law, a promise to do what you're already contractually obligated to do doesn't count as consideration. So if the buyer is reducing the quantity, perhaps the manufacturer isn't getting anything new, so no consideration. Thus, the modification isn't enforceable. So the answer is B.

But under UCC, that's not necessary. So perhaps the question is intended to be under common law, not UCC. So the answer is B.
</think>

The question revolves around the enforceability of a contract modification under contract law principles. The buyer and manufacturer agreed in writing to a contract for 1,000 gidgets at a total price of $4,000. Subsequently, they orally modified the agreement to reduce the quantity to 800 gidgets. The issue is why this modification might be unenforceable.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Violation of the Statute of Frauds**  
   The Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts, including those for the sale of goods over $500, to be in writing to be enforceable. However, the original contract was already in writing and satisfied the Statute of Frauds. The oral modification does not violate the Statute of Frauds because the original contract was valid, and the modification does not create a new contract requiring a separate writing. Thus, this is not the correct reason.

2. **Option B: No Consideration**  
   Under common law, a contract modification requires new consideration to be enforceable. The pre-existing duty rule states that a promise to perform an obligation already required under the contract does not constitute valid consideration. In this case, the parties orally agreed to reduce the quantity, but there is no indication of any new consideration provided by either party. If the question is governed by common law, the lack of consideration would make the modification unenforceable. However, under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which applies to the sale of goods, consideration is not required for modifications as long as they are made in good faith. Despite this, the question suggests the modification is unenforceable, implying that the common law principle of lack of consideration is the intended reasoning.

3. **Option C: The Original Contract Was in Writing**  
   A written contract does not inherently bar oral modifications unless the original contract explicitly requires modifications to be in writing. The question does not indicate such a provision, so the fact that the original contract was written does not make the oral modification unenforceable. This option is incorrect.

4. **Option D: Parol Evidence Rule**  
   The parol evidence rule applies to prior or contemporaneous agreements that contradict a written contract. It does not apply to subsequent modifications, as this is a case of mutual agreement to alter the terms of an existing contract. Therefore, this option is also incorrect
