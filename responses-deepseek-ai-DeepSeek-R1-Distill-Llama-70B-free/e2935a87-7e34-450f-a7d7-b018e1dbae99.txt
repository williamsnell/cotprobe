D: It is an example of a formal research tool for practitioners.
E: The information collected cannot be used in decision making.
F: It is exclusively used for market research.
G: All participants in the focus group should have similar backgrounds and experiences.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about focus group research, and I need to figure out which statement is true. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through each option carefully.

First, I remember that focus groups are a type of qualitative research method. They involve gathering people to discuss a specific topic, right? So the main idea is to get opinions, thoughts, and experiences from participants in a group setting. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: Participants should be selected at random. Hmm. I think focus groups are usually made up of people with similar characteristics or experiences related to the topic. They might not be random samples because the goal is to get diverse perspectives within a specific context. So maybe A is not correct.

Option B: The information can be generalized to a larger population. Wait, since focus groups are qualitative and typically involve a small, non-random sample, I don't think the results are meant to be generalized. Quantitative studies with larger samples are better for generalization. So B is probably false.

Option C: The findings generate qualitative data used to develop surveys. Yes! Focus groups are often used to explore ideas and identify themes. Researchers can then use these qualitative insights to create more structured survey questions. So C sounds correct.

Option D: It's a formal research tool for practitioners. I'm not sure. Formal tools might be more structured like experiments or surveys. Focus groups are more flexible and used in exploratory phases, so maybe D isn't right.

Option E: The info can't be used in decision making. That doesn't make sense. Focus groups are used to inform decisions, especially in areas like product development or policy making. So E is wrong.

Option F: Exclusively used for market research. No, I remember focus groups being used in various fields like social sciences, education, and healthcare as well. So F is incorrect.

Option G: All participants should have similar backgrounds. Wait, sometimes focus groups are homogeneous to delve deep into a specific group's experiences. But sometimes they can be mixed. So I'm not sure if G is always true. Maybe it's not a general rule.

Option H: Most efficient way to gather quantitative data. No, focus groups are for qualitative data. They don't quantify data efficiently; surveys are better for that. So H is wrong.

Option I: The facilitator's role is to observe, not guide. No, the facilitator usually guides the discussion to keep it on topic and ensure all points are covered. Observing is part of it, but guiding is a key role. So I is incorrect.

Option J: The group must have at least 20 participants. No, I think typical focus groups are much smaller, like 6-10 people. Having 20 would make it too big and probably less effective. So J is wrong.

Putting it all together, the correct answer seems to be Option C. Focus groups generate qualitative data which can then be used to develop surveys.

The correct answer is C. Focus group research generates qualitative data that can be used to develop surveys, making it a valuable tool in the exploratory phase of research.

Answer: C
