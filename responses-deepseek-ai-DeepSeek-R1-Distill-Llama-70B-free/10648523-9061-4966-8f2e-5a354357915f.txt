Question:

Several states have enacted laws shielding reporters from being compelled to release the names of confidential sources. Now, Congress, under intense lobbying pressure from the press, proposes to enact legislation forbidding any state from requiring journalists to reveal the sources of their news articles in civil suits. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument in support of this proposed law?

Options:

A: Congress has the authority under the commerce clause to regulate the flow of news.
B: Acts of Congress are the supreme law of the land and take precedence over any conflicting state laws.
C: Congress is essentially reaffirming the free speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
D: Under Article I, Section 8, Congress has the authority to secure to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about whether Congress can pass a law that stops states from making journalists reveal their confidential sources in civil suits. The proposed law is backed by press lobbying, and I need to find the strongest constitutional argument supporting it.

The options are A through D. Let me read each one carefully.

Option A says Congress can regulate the flow of news under the Commerce Clause. Hmm, the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. So, if news is being distributed across state lines, maybe it's commerce. But wait, the First Amendment is about free speech, and the Commerce Clause is more about economic activities. I'm not sure if regulating news under the Commerce Clause is the strongest argument here. It feels a bit off because this is more about speech than commerce.

Option B states that Acts of Congress are supreme and override state laws. That's the Supremacy Clause, right? Article VI says federal law is the supreme law of the land. But does that mean Congress can just pass any law and it trumps state laws? Well, yes, but only if the law is within Congress's constitutional authority. So, if Congress has the power to enact this law, then it would supersede state laws. But the question is about the constitutional argument supporting the law, not just its supremacy. So B might not be the strongest because it doesn't address the underlying power Congress has to pass the law in the first place.

Option C claims Congress is reaffirming the First and Fourteenth Amendments' free speech guarantees. The First Amendment protects freedom of the press, which includes journalists' sources. The Supreme Court has recognized a qualified privilege for reporters to protect their sources (like in Branzburg v. Hayes, though that was a state case). So if Congress is passing a law to shield journalists, it's enforcing the First Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause also incorporates the First Amendment against the states. So Congress could be acting to enforce these rights. That sounds like a solid argument because it's based on constitutional amendments that protect free speech and the press.

Option D talks about Article I, Section 8, which is about copyrights and patents. It says Congress can secure exclusive rights for authors. But this question is about protecting sources, not about intellectual property rights. So D doesn't seem relevant here. It's about a different power of Congress.

Putting it all together: the strongest argument would be based on the First Amendment. Congress is acting to protect free speech and press by preventing states from compelling journalists to reveal sources. So option C is the strongest because it's directly tied to constitutional free speech guarantees.

I think options A and D are not as strong because they're about different powers. Option B is about supremacy but doesn't address the source of Congress's authority. So C makes the most sense.

The strongest constitutional argument supporting the proposed law is that Congress is reaffirming the free speech guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The First Amendment protects freedom of the press, which includes the qualified privilege of journalists to shield their confidential sources. Congress, in enacting this law, would be enforcing these constitutional protections. 

Answer: C
