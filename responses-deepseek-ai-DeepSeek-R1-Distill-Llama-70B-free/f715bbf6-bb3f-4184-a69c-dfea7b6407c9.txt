Okay, I have this question about primates and I need to figure out which option isn't one. Let's see, the options are A: orangutan, B: marmot, C: chimpanzee, D: baboon.

First, I should recall what defines a primate. Primates include lemurs, lorises, tarsiers, monkeys, and apes. They typically have features like binocular vision, grasping hands and feet, and they usually give birth to a small number of offspring with relatively long gestation periods.

Now, looking at each option:

A: Orangutan. I know that's a great ape, native to Indonesia. Definitely a primate.

C: Chimpanzee. Also a great ape, very closely related to humans. So that's a primate too.

D: Baboon. These are monkeys, part of the Old World monkeys. They're social and live in groups, so they're primates.

B: Marmot. Wait, what's a marmot? I think marmots are rodents. They're large ground-dwelling squirrels, right? They live in burrows and are found in mountainous areas. So they belong to the rodent family, not primates.

So the one that's not a primate must be the marmot, option B.

The question asks which of the options is not a type of primate. 

- **Orangutan (A)**: This is a great ape, clearly a primate.  
- **Marmot (B)**: Marmots are rodents, not primates.  
- **Chimpanzee (C)**: Another great ape, definitely a primate.  
- **Baboon (D)**: A type of Old World monkey, so it is a primate.  

The correct answer is **B: marmot**, as it is the only option that is not a primate.  

Answer: B
