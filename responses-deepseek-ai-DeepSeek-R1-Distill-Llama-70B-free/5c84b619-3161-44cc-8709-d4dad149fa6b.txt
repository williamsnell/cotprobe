Question:

A man and a woman were involved in a car accident that occurred when the man abruptly switched lanes in front of the woman without signaling. Unable to stop, the woman hit the man's car into a median. Immediately after the accident, as the two drivers emerged from their vehicles, a pedestrian, obviously emotional and upset from having just observed an accident, ran up to the man and shouted, "You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?" The pedestrian is never identified and is not present at trial. The pedestrian's statement is

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the bystander was not involved in the accident.
B: admissible under the excited utterance exception.
C: admissible as non-hearsay.
D: admissible, even though it is hearsay.
E: admissible under the present sense impression exception.
F: inadmissible, because it is an opinion, not a fact.
G: inadmissible, because the bystander cannot be identified and is not present at trial.
H: inadmissible, because it is prejudicial to the defendant.
I: admissible under the spontaneous statement exception.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the situation is a car accident between a man and a woman. The man switched lanes abruptly without signaling, causing the woman to crash into him and hit the median. After the accident, both drivers get out, and a pedestrian approaches the man. This pedestrian is clearly emotional and upset because he just saw the accident. He shouts at the man, calling him a careless driver and says something about not using a turn signal when switching lanes. Now, the pedestrian isn't identified and isn't present at the trial. The question is about whether the pedestrian's statement is admissible.

The options are from A to I, and I need to pick the right one. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that hearsay is a major issue in evidence law. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. If the pedestrian's statement is hearsay, it's inadmissible unless an exception applies.

So the pedestrian's statement is, "You careless driver, you. Didn't you ever learn that you're supposed to use a turn signal when you switch lanes?" This is being offered to prove that the man was careless and didn't use his turn signal, which would make him at fault. So, yes, it's being offered for the truth of the matter, which makes it hearsay.

Now, the exceptions to hearsay. There are a few that might apply here: excited utterance, present sense impression, or maybe the statement isn't hearsay at all. Let's think about each.

Excited utterance is under FRE 803(2). It applies when a statement is made under the stress of a startling event and relates to that event. The pedestrian just saw an accident, which is a startling event. He's emotional and upset, so he's under the stress of that event. His statement relates to the accident because he's commenting on the man's actions. So this seems like a possible exception.

Another exception is present sense impression, which is FRE 803(1). That's a statement describing an event made while the declarant is perceiving it or immediately thereafter. But here, the pedestrian made the statement immediately after the accident, but he's not describing what he just saw as it's happening. Instead, he's commenting on the man's actions. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the excitement of the moment.

Wait, but the pedestrian's statement is more of an accusation. He's not just describing what happened but is making a judgment about the man's carelessness. I'm not sure if that's covered under excited utterance. Because excited utterance allows for statements relating to the event, but I think it includes statements that are reactions to the event, even if they are accusatory.

Alternatively, the statement could be considered not hearsay. If the statement is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but just to show that the pedestrian was upset or something. But in this case, it's being offered to show that the man was careless, so it is for the truth. So it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Looking at the options, option B is excited utterance exception, E is present sense impression, and I is spontaneous statement exception. Wait, I think spontaneous statement is another term for excited utterance.

Option C says it's admissible as non-hearsay. I don't think so because it's being offered for the truth. So C is probably not correct.

Option D says admissible even though it's hearsay, which would mean an exception applies. But the option is a bit vague. If it's under an exception, like excited utterance, then it's admissible under that exception. So D is correct only if the exception applies, but the option isn't specific.

Looking at the options, B is excited utterance, E is present sense impression. Which one fits better?

The man's action of switching lanes without signaling and the accident just happened. The pedestrian is upset and immediately responds. His statement relates to the event he just witnessed. So it's an excited utterance because it was made under the stress of the event.

As for present sense impression, that's more for statements made contemporaneously with the event or immediately after. But excited utterance is more about the stress, so I think excited utterance applies here.

So the pedestrian's statement would be admissible under the excited utterance exception. So option B is the correct answer.

Wait, but could the statement be excluded for some other reason? Like if it's an opinion. Option F says it's inadmissible because it's an opinion, not a fact. The pedestrian calls the man "careless," which is an opinion. But under FRE 803(2), excited utterances can include opinions if they relate to the event. Or maybe the statement is a statement of fact wrapped in an opinion. Hmm, but I think for excited utterance, the entire statement is admissible as long as it relates to the event and was made under stress.

So the statement is admissible as an excited utterance, making option B correct.
</think>

The pedestrian's statement is being offered to prove that the man was careless and failed to use a turn signal, making it hearsay under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE). Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless an exception applies. 

The statement qualifies as an excited utterance under FRE 803(2) because it was made immediately after a startling event (the car accident), while the pedestrian was still under the stress of that event. The content of the statement relates to the event and reflects the pedestrian's reaction to it. Although the statement includes an opinion ("careless driver"), excited utterances can include such language when made in the heat of the moment.

Other options are less applicable: 
- **Present sense impression (FRE 803(1))** typically applies to statements describing an event as it is perceived or immediately after, but here the statement is more of a reaction to the event.
- The statement is hearsay, so it cannot be admissible as non-hearsay (option C).
- While option D correctly states that the statement is admissible despite being hearsay, it is less specific than option B, which identifies the excited utterance exception.

Thus, the correct answer is that the pedestrian's statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception.

**Answer: B**
