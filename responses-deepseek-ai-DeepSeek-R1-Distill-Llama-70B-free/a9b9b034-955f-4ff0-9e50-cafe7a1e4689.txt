Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the pH of a solution in two different scenarios. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on buffer solutions, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem has two parts, (a) and (b). Let me start with part (a): a 0.5 M solution of CH3COOH and CH3COONa. I remember that when you mix a weak acid with its conjugate base, you get a buffer solution. Buffers are great because they resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added.

Wait, what's the formula for calculating the pH of a buffer? Oh right, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. That's pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). Right. So I need to find the pKa first. The given Ka is 1.75e-5. So pKa is the negative logarithm of that.

Calculating pKa: log(1.75e-5) is... Let me think. 1e-5 is 5, so that's a log of 5. Then 1.75 is about 0.243. So pKa is 4.74 or so. Because log(1.75e-5) = log(1.75) + log(1e-5) → 0.243 + (-5) → -4.757, so wait, no. Wait, wait. No, because pKa is -log(Ka). So if Ka is 1.75e-5, then pKa is -log(1.75e-5). Let me compute that more accurately.

Taking 1.75e-5. The log(1.75) is approximately 0.2430. So log(1.75e-5) is 0.2430 -5 = -4.757, so pKa is 4.757. Let's say 4.76 for simplicity.

Now, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The solution is 0.5 M for both CH3COOH and CH3COONa. Wait, because CH3COONa dissociates into CH3COO^- and Na+. So the concentration of A- (acetate ion) is 0.5 M, and the concentration of HA (acetic acid) is also 0.5 M.

So plugging into the equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]) → 4.76 + log(0.5/0.5) → 4.76 + log(1) → 4.76 + 0 → 4.76. So the pH is 4.76. That's part (a).

Now part (b): the same solution after adding 0.1 mole HCl per liter. Hmm. So HCl is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely. The H+ ions will react with the acetate ions (A-) in the solution.

Wait, the initial concentrations are both 0.5 M for CH3COOH and CH3COONa. So the moles per liter are each 0.5. Let me think in terms of moles because adding HCl adds H+.

HCl will donate H+ ions, which will react with CH3COO^- (the conjugate base). The reaction is H+ + CH3COO^- → CH3COOH.

So, let's calculate the moles after adding HCl.

Initial moles in 1 liter:
CH3COOH: 0.5 mol
CH3COO^-: 0.5 mol

HCl added: 0.1 mol H+ per liter → 0.1 mol in 1 L.

The H+ will react with CH3COO^-.

So moles after reaction:
CH3COO^-: 0.5 - 0.1 = 0.4 mol
CH3COOH: 0.5 + 0.1 = 0.6 mol

So now, the concentrations are [A-] = 0.4 M and [HA] = 0.6 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Does the volume change? The problem says to assume the volume is unchanged. So when we add HCl, it's in 1 L, so the volume remains 1 L. So the concentrations are 0.4 M and 0.6 M.

So using Henderson-Hasselbalch again. pH = pKa + log(0.4/0.6).

0.4/0.6 is 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. The log of 2/3. Let me think: log(2) is 0.3010, log(3) is 0.4771. So log(2/3) = log(2) - log(3) ≈ 0.3010 - 0.4771 = -0.1761.

So pH = 4.76 + (-0.1761) → 4.5839. Approximately 4.58.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check that calculation. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, using exact calculation. Let me compute log(0.4/0.6) = log(2/3) = log(0.6667). 

Log(0.6667) is approximately -0.1761, so pH is 4.76 - 0.1761 = 4.5839. So about 4.58.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. For part (a), the pH is 4.76, and part (b) is 4.58.

Looking at the options, option J is (4.76, 4.58). Option C is (4.76,4.65), option J is (4.76,4.58). So that would make option J the correct choice.

Wait, but let me make sure. Are there any other factors I might have missed?

Wait, when we add HCl, a strong acid, it will fully dissociate, and the H+ will react with the acetate ions. So yes, the moles of acetate (A-) decrease by 0.1, and acetic acid (HA) increases by 0.1.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach is correct here. So the calculations seem right.

So for part (a): 4.76, part (b): 4.58.

Looking at the options, the only option that matches is J: 4.76, 4.58.

To calculate the pH of the given solution in both scenarios, we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right)
\]

### Part (a): pH of the buffer solution
The solution contains 0.5 M CH₃COOH (weak acid) and 0.5 M CH₃COONa (conjugate base). The dissociation constant \( K_a \) for acetic acid is \( 1.75 \times 10^{-5} \), so:

\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(K_a) = -\log(1.75 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.76
\]

Since the concentrations of CH₃COOH (\([\text{HA}]\)) and CH₃COO⁻ (\([\text{A}^-]\)) are equal, the ratio \(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = 1\), and \(\log(1) = 0\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.76 + \log(1) = 4.76
\]

### Part (b): pH after adding 0.1 mole HCl per liter
HCl is a strong acid that dissociates completely, donating \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) per liter. The \( \text{H}^+ \) reacts with CH₃COO⁻ (conjugate base) to form CH₃COOH (weak acid). The initial moles of CH₃COOH and CH₃COO⁻ in 1 liter are both \( 0.5 \, \text{mol} \). After the reaction:

- Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (\([\text{A}^-]\)): \( 0.5 - 0.1 = 0.4 \, \text{mol} \)
- Moles of CH₃COOH (\([\text{HA}]\)): \( 0.5 + 0.1 = 0.6 \, \text{mol} \)

Since the volume is unchanged, the concentrations are:

\[
[\text{A}^-] = 0.4 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{HA}] = 0.6 \, \text{M}
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.76 + \log\left(\frac{0.4}{0.6}\right)
\]

\[
\log\left(\frac{0.4}{0.6}\right) = \log(0.6667) \approx -0.176
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 4.76 - 0.176 = 4.58
\]

### Final Answer
For part (a), the pH is 4.76, and for part (b), the pH is 4.58. Comparing these values with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**J: 4.76, 4.58**
