Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about estimating the change in Gibbs energy when the pressure on benzene is increased. The setup is that we have 1.0 dm³ of benzene, and the pressure increases from 1.0 atm to 100 atm. We need to find the Gibbs energy change for this process. All gases are considered perfect, and the temperature is 298.15 K.

Hmm, wait a second. Benzene is a liquid, isn't it? Or is it a gas under these conditions? Because if it's a liquid, then the calculation for Gibbs energy change with pressure would be different than if it were a gas. Oh, right, the problem says to assume all gases are perfect. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the question is about benzene. Benzene is a liquid at room temperature and pressure. But maybe under certain conditions, it's a gas. But the question says that we're to treat all gases as perfect, implying that we're dealing with gases. Wait, but benzene isn't a gas at standard conditions. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the question is treating benzene as a gas for the sake of the problem. Because, in reality, at 298 K and 1 atm, benzene is a liquid. But maybe, for the sake of the problem, we're to consider it as a perfect gas. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the process where benzene is in the gas phase. But wait, if the pressure is increased from 1 atm to 100 atm, and assuming it's a gas, then perhaps we can model it as an ideal gas.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: The Gibbs energy change when pressure changes for a substance can be calculated using the equation ΔG = nVΔP, but wait, I think I'm mixing up some equations here. Alternatively, I remember that for a process at constant temperature, the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) is given by the integral of V dP, where V is the volume and P is the pressure.

Wait, the formula I recall is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1) when dealing with an ideal gas at constant temperature. But wait, that's for the change in Gibbs energy when the pressure changes, assuming the gas is ideal and the process is isothermal. But wait, when would that apply?

Wait, another thought: the Gibbs free energy change for a gas when pressure changes is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). But wait, that's when the gas is undergoing a change in pressure, and assuming it's an ideal gas. So if the gas goes from pressure P1 to P2 at constant temperature, then yes, that's the formula.

But wait, but in this problem, benzene is a liquid. So maybe I'm supposed to treat it as a liquid, and for liquids, the volume is considered constant because liquids are incompressible. So the change in Gibbs energy for a liquid when pressure increases can be approximated as ΔG ≈ VΔP, where V is the molar volume and ΔP is the change in pressure.

But wait, the question gives the volume as 1.0 dm³. Wait, 1 dm³ is 1 liter. So if it's a liquid, then the volume is 1.0 dm³, which is 0.001 m³. But wait, let me think about molar volume. Benzene's molar mass is about 78 g/mol. The density of benzene is around 0.876 g/cm³, so 1 dm³ (which is 1 liter or 1000 cm³) would have a mass of 876 grams, which is 876 / 78 ≈ 11.23 moles. So n ≈ 11.23 mol.

Wait, but if benzene is a liquid, and if the volume doesn't change much with pressure (since liquids are incompressible), then the Gibbs energy change would be ΔG = VΔP. So V is 1.0 dm³, ΔP is 100 atm - 1 atm = 99 atm. But wait, units matter here. Because in SI, pressure is in Pascals, and volume is in m³.

So 1 atm is approximately 101325 Pascals. So ΔP = 99 * 101325 Pa. Let me compute that. 100 atm is 101325 * 100 = 10,132,500 Pa, so 99 atm is 10,132,500 - 101325 = 9,  (Wait, no, 100 atm is 101325 *100 = 10,132,500 Pa. So 99 atm is 99 * 101325 = Let me calculate that. 100 * 101325 = 10,132,500; subtract one atm (101325), so 99 atm = 10,132,500 - 101,325 = 10,031,175 Pa.

Wait, but 1.0 dm³ is 0.001 m³. So ΔG = V * ΔP = 0.001 m³ * 10,031,175 Pa.

Wait, but wait, Pa is N/m². So m³ * Pa is N*m, which is Joules. So 0.001 m³ * 10,031,175 Pa = 0.001 * 10,031,175 = 10,031.175 J. Which is about 10,031 J, or approximately 10 kJ. So the change in Gibbs energy would be positive because ΔP is positive (压力增加), so ΔG is positive.

Wait, but wait, the problem says to consider all gases as perfect, which suggests that maybe I'm supposed to treat benzene as a gas. But that would be incorrect because benzene is a liquid at standard conditions. So perhaps I should approach it as if benzene is a gas, and use the ideal gas equation.

Wait, if benzene is considered as a perfect gas, then the Gibbs energy change would be nRT ln(P2/P1). Let's compute that.

First, find n. The volume is 1.0 dm³, which is 0.001 m³. The pressure is initially 1.0 atm, so let's compute the number of moles using PV = nRT.

But wait, the problem is that the volume remains constant? Or does the pressure change and the volume change? Wait, no, the system is 1.0 dm³ of benzene, and the pressure is increased. So perhaps it's at constant volume? No, wait, no, the problem isn't saying whether the volume is constant or not. Wait, no, the question says "the pressure acting on it is increased from 1.0 atm to 100 atm." So it's a process where the pressure is applied, but perhaps the volume changes. But in the case of a gas, the volume would change with pressure.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

If benzene is treated as an ideal gas, then the Gibbs energy change when pressure increases from P1 to P2 at constant T is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). So I need to find n, the number of moles.

Wait, but I don't have the volume under standard conditions. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of moles in 1.0 dm³ of benzene gas at 1 atm and 298 K.

Wait, using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT.

So P is 1.0 atm, which is 101325 Pa. V is 1.0 dm³ = 0.001 m³. R is 8.314 J/mol·K. T is 298 K.

So n = (P V)/(R T) = (101325 * 0.001) / (8.314 * 298).

Compute numerator: 101325 * 0.001 = 101.325.

Denominator: 8.314 * 298 ≈ 2477.572.

So n ≈ 101.325 / 2477.572 ≈ approximately 0.0409 moles.

Then, ΔG = n R T ln(P2/P1). P2 is 100 atm, P1 is 1 atm.

So ln(100/1) = ln(100) ≈ 4.605.

So ΔG = 0.0409 * 8.314 * 298 * 4.605.

Compute step by step:

0.0409 * 8.314 ≈ 0.0409 * 8 ≈ 0.3272, 0.0409 * 0.314 ≈ ~0.0128, so total ≈ 0.34.

Then, 0.34 * 298 ≈ 101.32.

Then, 101.32 * 4.605 ≈ Let's approximate 100 * 4.605 = 460.5, and 1.32 * 4.605 ≈ ~6.07, so total ≈ 466.57 J. Which is about 466.6 J, or approximately 0.467 kJ.

But wait, the options are in the range of 10s of kJ. So if I treat benzene as a gas, I get a ΔG of about 0.467 kJ, which is much lower than any of the options given, which start from -10 kJ up to +50 kJ. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is treating benzene as a liquid, and thus the volume is considered constant. So for a liquid, the change in Gibbs energy when the pressure increases is ΔG = VΔP. So the volume is 1.0 dm³, which is 0.001 m³, and the pressure change is from 1 atm to 100 atm, so ΔP is 99 atm.

But wait, 1 atm is 101325 Pa. So 99 atm is 99 * 101325 = let me compute that: 100 atm is 10132500 Pa, so subtract 101325 to get 99 atm: 10132500 - 101325 = 10,031,175 Pa.

So ΔG = V * ΔP = 0.001 m³ * 10,031,175 Pa.

0.001 * 10,031,175 = 10,031.175 J, which is about 10,031 J, or approximately 10 kJ.

Looking at the options, option I is +10 kJ. So that's a possibility.

But wait, wait a second. For a liquid, the molar volume is used, right? Because Gibbs energy is an extensive property, so it's per mole. Wait, but the formula ΔG = VΔP would be for the total volume, not molar volume. Because V is extensive, so for the entire sample, it's V (in m³) multiplied by ΔP (in Pa) to get J.

Yes, so in that case, 0.001 m³ * 10,031,175 Pa gives about 10,000 J, which is 10 kJ. So the answer would be +10 kJ, which is option I.

Wait, but wait another thing. In the formula for ΔG for a liquid under pressure change, is there any other factor? Because for solids and liquids, the Gibbs energy change is approximately ΔG ≈ VΔP, assuming that the volume doesn't change much with pressure (because they're not very compressible). So that seems correct.

So in this case, the correct calculation would be ΔG ≈ VΔP, leading to about +10 kJ, which is option I.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Compute ΔP in Pascals:

100 atm - 1 atm = 99 atm.

Each atm is 101325 Pa, so 99 * 101325 = Let's compute:

100 * 101325 = 10,132,500.

Subtract 101325: 10,132,500 - 101,325 = 10,031,175 Pa.

V is 1.0 dm³ = 0.001 m³.

ΔG = 0.001 m³ * 10,031,175 Pa = 10,031.175 J.

Convert to kJ: 10,031.175 J ≈ 10.03 kJ, which is approximately +10 kJ. So option I.

But wait, another thought: Since the problem refers to 1.0 dm³ of benzene, which is a liquid, and liquids have high densities, so a volume of 1 dm³ would correspond to a significant number of moles. But when you calculate ΔG as VΔP, you don't need to worry about moles because you're using the total volume. So that's correct.

Alternatively, if benzene were a gas, the calculation would be much smaller, but as we saw earlier, that gives about 0.467 kJ, which doesn't match any options. So treating it as a liquid is the right approach here.

So the correct answer should be option I: +10 kJ.
</think>

To estimate the change in Gibbs energy of 1.0 dm³ of benzene when the pressure is increased from 1.0 atm to 100 atm, we consider benzene as a liquid. For liquids, the change in Gibbs energy with pressure can be approximated as:

\[
\Delta G = V \Delta P
\]

Where:
- \( V \) is the volume of benzene, given as \( 1.0 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 = 0.001 \, \mathrm{m}^3 \),
- \( \Delta P \) is the change in pressure, calculated as \( P_2 - P_1 = 100 \, \mathrm{atm} - 1 \, \mathrm{atm} = 99 \, \mathrm{atm} \).

Converting \( \Delta P \) to Pascals:
\[
1 \, \mathrm{atm} = 101325 \, \mathrm{Pa}, \quad \Delta P = 99 \times 101325 = 10,031,175 \, \mathrm{Pa}.
\]

Substituting into the equation:
\[
\Delta G = V \Delta P = 0.001 \, \mathrm{m}^3 \times 10,031,175 \, \mathrm{Pa} = 10,031.175 \, \mathrm{J}.
\]

Converting to kilojoules:
\[
\Delta G \approx 10.03 \, \mathrm{kJ}.
\]

Since the pressure increases, the Gibbs energy change is positive. Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is **+10 kJ**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I: +10 kJ**
