Okay, so I've got this question about neuron membrane potentials, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says: A change in a neuron membrane potential from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts is considered what? And there are options from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that neurons have different states of membrane potential. The resting potential is when the neuron is not being stimulated, right? I think that's around -70 mV. Oh wait, so if the neuron is at +50 mV and then goes to -70 mV, that's a big change. 

Wait, what's the normal sequence here. So, when a neuron is at rest, it's about -70 mV. When it gets excited, it depolarizes, meaning the membrane potential becomes less negative, moving towards zero and even positive. So, if the membrane potential goes from -70 to +50, that's depolarizationâ€”like when an action potential happens. 

But in this question, it's the opposite. The change is from +50 to -70. So, that's going from a positive value back to a negative one. I think that's called repolarization. Because after an action potential (which is the depolarization), the membrane returns to its resting state by repolarizing, bringing the potential back to -70 mV.

Wait, but are there other terms I should consider? Let's think. Hyperpolarization is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential, like -80 mV or something. But in this case, it's going back to the resting state, not beyond it, so that's just repolarization, not hyperpolarization.

What about action potential? The action potential is the rapid depolarization, reaching up to +30 or +50 mV, and then repolarization. So the change from +50 to -70 is part of the action potential phase, specifically the repolarization part.

So looking at the options:

A: Threshold potential is around -55 mV, the point where action potential is triggered. Not relevant here.

B: Hyperpolarization is more negative than resting. Not the case.

C: Action potential is the whole process, but the question is about the change from +50 to -70, which is just the repolarization phase.

D: Equilibrium potential is the state where ion concentrations balance, but I don't think that's what's being asked.

E: Resting potential is -70 mV, but the question is about the change, not the state.

F: Graded potentials are varying strengths, like in dendrites, but this is more about the action potential.

G: Depolarization is going from -70 to +50, which is the opposite.

H: Synapse potential? Not sure, but I think that's more about synaptic potentials, which are graded.

I: Refractory period is the time after an action potential when the neuron can't fire again. Not directly about the voltage change.

J: Repolarization is the process of returning to resting potential after depolarization. So that fits.

Wait, but another thought: when does repolarization occur? After the peak of the action potential, K+ channels open, and the cell returns to resting. So yes, this change is repolarization.

So the answer should be J: repolarization.

The question asks about a change in neuron membrane potential from +50 mV to -70 mV. This change represents the process of returning to the resting potential after an action potential. Here's the analysis of the options:

- **A: Threshold potential** refers to the point (-55 mV) where an action potential is triggered, not relevant here.  
- **B: Hyperpolarization** occurs when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential (e.g., -80 mV), which is not the case here.  
- **C: Action potential** is the entire process of depolarization and repolarization, but the question specifically focuses on the change from +50 mV to -70 mV, which is only the repolarization phase.  
- **D: Equilibrium potential** is related to ion concentration balance, not the voltage change described.  
- **E: Resting potential** is the final state (-70 mV), but the question is about the process of change, not the state itself.  
- **F: Graded potential** refers to varying potentials in dendrites, unrelated to this scenario.  
- **G: Depolarization** is the opposite process, where the membrane potential becomes less negative or even positive.  
- **H: Synapse potential** pertains to synaptic transmission, not the voltage change described.  
- **I: Refractory period** is the time after an action potential when the neuron cannot fire again, not directly related to the voltage change.  
- **J: Repolarization** is the process of returning the membrane potential to its resting state after depolarization, which matches the change from +50 mV to -70 mV.

The correct answer is **J: repolarization**.
