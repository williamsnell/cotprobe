Okay, so I've got this problem about an inductor and I need to find the voltage across it. Hmm, I remember that inductors have something to do with voltage and current changing over time. Oh right, Faraday's law or something like that. 

Wait, the formula for the voltage across an inductor is V = L * (di/dt), right? Yeah, that sounds familiar. So the voltage is the inductance multiplied by the derivative of the current with respect to time.

The question gives me the current through the inductor as i_L(t) = 0.1 sin(10^6 t). And the inductance L is 10^-3 henrys. Okay, so I need to find V_L(t) across this inductor.

Let me think about taking the derivative of the current. The current is a sine function. The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), right? So the derivative of sin(10^6 t) with respect to t would be 10^6 cos(10^6 t). Oh wait, because of the chain rule—so 10^6 is the derivative of the inside term, so it multiplies by the cosine.

So putting it all together. di/dt is the derivative of 0.1 sin(10^6 t). The 0.1 is a constant, so it stays. The derivative of sin is cos, multiplied by the derivative of the argument, which is 10^6. So di/dt = 0.1 * 10^6 cos(10^6 t). 

Wait, 0.1 times 1e6 is 1e5, right? Because 1e6 is a million, so 0.1 million is 1e5. So di/dt = 100,000 cos(1e6 t).

Then the voltage V_L is L multiplied by di/dt. L is 1e-3 H. So V_L = (1e-3) * (1e5) cos(1e6 t). 

Wait, 1e-3 times 1e5 is 1e2, because when you multiply exponents with the same base, you add the powers. So 1e-3 * 1e5 = 1e( -3 +5 )= 1e2. So 1e2 is 100. 

So V_L(t) = 100 cos(1e6 t). Let me look at the options. Option B is 100 cos(1e6 t). So the answer should be B.

Wait, did I make a mistake anywhere? Let me double-check. Current is 0.1 sin(ωt), ω is 1e6. di/dt is 0.1 * ω cos(ωt). Oh yeah, that's 0.1 * 1e6 = 1e5. Multiply by L which is 1e-3: 1e5 * 1e-3 is 1e2, which is 100. So yes, option B.

To find the voltage \( V_L(t) \) across the inductor, we use the formula for the voltage across an inductor:

\[
V_L(t) = L \cdot \frac{di_L}{dt}
\]

The current through the inductor is given as:

\[
i_L(t) = 0.1 \sin(10^6 t)
\]

First, we compute the derivative of \( i_L(t) \) with respect to time:

\[
\frac{di_L}{dt} = 0.1 \cdot \frac{d}{dt} \left[ \sin(10^6 t) \right]
\]

Using the chain rule, the derivative of \( \sin(10^6 t) \) is \( 10^6 \cos(10^6 t) \). Therefore:

\[
\frac{di_L}{dt} = 0.1 \cdot 10^6 \cos(10^6 t) = 10^5 \cos(10^6 t)
\]

Now, substitute \( \frac{di_L}{dt} \) into the formula for \( V_L(t) \), where \( L = 10^{-3} \, \text{H} \):

\[
V_L(t) = 10^{-3} \cdot 10^5 \cos(10^6 t)
\]

Simplify \( 10^{-3} \cdot 10^5 \):

\[
V_L(t) = 10^2 \cos(10^6 t) = 100 \cos(10^6 t)
\]

Thus, the voltage across the inductor is \( V_L(t) = 100 \cos(10^6 t) \). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: \( 100 \cos(10^6 t) \)**
