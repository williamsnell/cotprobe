Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about prisms and the minimum deviation. Hmm, I remember that when light passes through a prism, the angle of deviation depends on the angle of incidence and the refracting angle of the prism. The question says the minimum deviation is 32 degrees and 40 minutes, and the refracting angle is 40 degrees. I need to find the refractive index of the prism material.

Wait, I think the formula for minimum deviation in a prism is given by the equation: 

minimum deviation (δ_min) = 2 * (n * sin(α) - sin(α)) 

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, the minimum deviation occurs when the angle of incidence equals the angle of emergence, which is when the light ray passes symmetrically through the prism.

The formula I think is: δ_min = (n - 1) * A, where A is the apex angle of the prism. But wait, that doesn't seem right because I remember that for minimum deviation, there's a specific relation involving the angles.

Let me think again. The formula for the deviation δ is given by:

δ = A + (i1 + i2) - 90°?

Wait, no, maybe it's:

When the light enters the prism, it's refracted at the first face, then exits after the second face. The deviation is the total change in direction. For minimum deviation, the light hits the prism such that the incident angle on the first face equals the emergent angle on the second face, and this occurs when the path inside the prism is symmetric.

The formula I remember is:

n = (sin( (A + δ_min)/2 )) / sin( A/2 )

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Oh wait, no, the correct formula for the minimum deviation is when the angle inside the prism is 90 degrees minus the apex angle over two. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach. The formula for minimum deviation is:

δ_min = 2 * (n * sin(α) - sin(α)) 

Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I think the correct formula when the prism has an apex angle A, and the minimum deviation is δ_min, then:

δ_min = A + 2 * sin^{-1}( (n * sin(A/2)) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Oh, I think I'm mixing it up. Let me look it up in my notes.

Wait, the correct formula is:

At minimum deviation, the angle of incidence on each face is equal, and the formula is:

n = (sin( (A + δ_min)/2 )) / sin( A/2 )

Yes, that's right. So here, δ_min is given as 32 degrees and 40 minutes. I need to convert that to decimal degrees. 40 minutes is 40/60 = 0.6667 degrees, so δ_min = 32.6667 degrees.

The apex angle A is 40 degrees.

So substituting into the formula:

n = sin( (40 + 32.6667)/2 ) / sin(40/2 )

Calculating the numerator inside the sine: 40 + 32.6667 = 72.6667 degrees. Half of that is 36.3333 degrees.

The denominator inside the sine is 40/2 = 20 degrees.

So n = sin(36.3333°) / sin(20°).

Let me compute that. I'll need to get the sine values.

sin(36.3333°) ≈ let's see. 36 degrees is 0.5878 (since sin(30)=0.5, sin(45)≈0.7071). 36.333 is roughly 36 and 1/3 degrees. Maybe about 0.5924.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Using a calculator:

sin(36.3333) ≈ let's compute 36.3333 degrees.

Let me convert it to radians? Alternatively, I'll use approximate values.

Alternatively, I can remember that sin(36°) is about 0.5878 and sin(36.3333) would be slightly higher. Let's compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach.

But since I can't use a calculator, I'll proceed with approximate values.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps better to compute using exact expressions.

Wait, let me try to compute it step by step.

n = sin(36.3333) / sin(20)

Compute sin(20°) first. I know that sin(20) ≈ 0.3420.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me correct that. Wait, sin(20 degrees) is approximately 0.3420. No, wait, actually, sin(30) is 0.5, so sin(20) would be less. Let me think: sin(0)=0, sin(30)=0.5, sin(45)=0.7071, sin(60)=0.8660, sin(90)=1.

Wait, sin(20) is approximately 0.3420, yes. And sin(36.3333°) is approximately 0.5924.

So n ≈ 0.5924 / 0.3420 ≈ let me calculate that.

0.5924 / 0.3420 ≈ 1.733.

Hmm, that's about 1.733. Wait, looking at the options, option J is 1.7323, which is close to 1.732, which would be sqrt(3) approximately 1.73205.

So my calculation gives about 1.733, which is very close to option J, 1.7323.

Wait, but let me check the exact calculation with more precise numbers, because the approximate method could be leading me close but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value using more precise sine values.

Let me calculate the numerator and denominator more accurately.

First, compute (A + δ_min)/2 = (40 + 32.6667)/2 = 72.6667 / 2 = 36.3333 degrees.

Compute sin(36.3333°):

Using a calculator, sin(36.3333) ≈ sin(36.3333) ≈ 0.5924.

Sin(20°) is approximately 0.3420201.

So 0.5924 / 0.3420201 ≈ 1.733.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator for more precise values.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the exact formula again.

The formula is n = sin( (A + δ_min)/2 ) / sin( A/2 )

So substituting the values:

(A + δ_min) = 40 + 32.6667 = 72.6667 degrees.

Half of that is 36.3333 degrees.

A/2 is 20 degrees.

So n = sin(36.3333) / sin(20).

Let me compute these sine values more accurately.

I can use a calculator here, but since I don't have one, I'll approximate.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can remember some exact sine values or use series expansion, but that's probably too time-consuming.

Another approach: I think that for small angles, the approximation sin(x) ≈ x in radians, but that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps using known sine values:

sin(30°) = 0.5

sin(35°) ≈ 0.5736

sin(36°) ≈ 0.5878

sin(36.3333) is 36 and 20 minutes, which is 36.3333 degrees.

Between 36 and 37 degrees.

sin(37°) ≈ 0.6018.

So from 36 to 37 degrees, each degree is about 0.014 increase in sine.

So 36.3333 is 0.3333 degrees above 36. So 0.5878 + (0.3333)*(0.6018-0.5878)/1 ≈ 0.5878 + (0.3333)(0.014) ≈ 0.5878 + 0.00467 ≈ 0.59247.

So sin(36.3333) ≈ 0.59247.

Sin(20°) is approximately 0.3420201.

So n ≈ 0.59247 / 0.3420201 ≈ let's compute this.

0.59247 ÷ 0.34202.

Let me compute this division.

0.34202 × 1.73 = ?

0.34202 × 1.7 = 0.58154

0.34202 × 0.03 = 0.0102606

So 0.34202 × 1.73 = 0.58154 + 0.01026 ≈ 0.5918.

Which is very close to 0.59247.

So 1.73 × 0.34202 ≈ 0.5918.

Our numerator is 0.59247, which is 0.59247 - 0.5918 ≈ 0.00067 higher.

So 0.00067 / 0.34202 ≈ 0.00196.

So total is approximately 1.73 + 0.00196 ≈ 1.73196 ≈ 1.732.

So n ≈ 1.732.

Looking at the options, option J is 1.7323, which is very close.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I use the correct formula?

Yes, the formula is n = sin( (A + δ_min)/2 ) / sin(A/2 ), correct.

So with A =40°, δ_min=32°40' =32.6667°, so (40+32.6667)/2=36.3333°, and A/2=20°, so the calculation holds.

So the correct answer is option J: 1.7323.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the refractive index \( n \) of a prism when the minimum deviation \( \delta_{\text{min}} \) and the apex angle \( A \) are known:

\[
n = \frac{\sin\left(\frac{A + \delta_{\text{min}}}{2}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{A}{2}\right)}
\]

### Given:
- Apex angle \( A = 40^\circ \)
- Minimum deviation \( \delta_{\text{min}} = 32^\circ 40' = 32.6667^\circ \)

### Step 1: Calculate the angles
1. \( \frac{A + \delta_{\text{min}}}{2} = \frac{40 + 32.6667}{2} = 36.3333^\circ \)
2. \( \frac{A}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20^\circ \)

### Step 2: Compute the sine values
1. \( \sin(36.3333^\circ) \approx 0.5924 \)
2. \( \sin(20^\circ) \approx 0.3420 \)

### Step 3: Calculate \( n \)
\[
n = \frac{\sin(36.3333^\circ)}{\sin(20^\circ)} = \frac{0.5924}{0.3420} \approx 1.733
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The calculated value \( n \approx 1.733 \) is very close to option **J: 1.7323**, which corresponds to \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.73205 \).

Thus, the refractive index of the prism is approximately **1.7323**.
