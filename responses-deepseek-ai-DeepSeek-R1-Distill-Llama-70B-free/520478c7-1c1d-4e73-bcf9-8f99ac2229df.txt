Okay, so I have this question about insurance premiums and refunds. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says that Barnes and Sons, Co. insured their offices with an annual premium of $130 on March 3. Then, on October 15, the carrier canceled the policy. I need to find out what refund they're due.

Hmm, so the key here is to figure out how much of the policy period has passed and how much is left. Since the carrier is canceling it, they probably refund the unused portion based on the time elapsed.

First, I should determine how many months the policy was in effect. The policy started on March 3 and was canceled on October 15. Let me count the months:

March: The policy started on the 3rd, so March is not a full month. Wait, but wait—insurance policies usually consider the start date as the beginning of coverage. So March is a full month because it's from the 3rd to the end. Or maybe they prorate it based on days?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of days to be precise. Let me calculate the exact number of days between March 3 and October 15.

March has 31 days, so from March 3 to March 31 is 31 - 3 + 1 = 29 days? Wait no, wait. From March 3 to March 31 is 29 days because the 3rd is day 1. So 31-3 =28, plus 1 gives 29 days in March.

Then April has 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30, and then October up to the 15th.

Wait, let me list them all out:

March: 29 days (from 3rd to 31st)
April: 30
May:31
June:30
July:31
August:31
September:30
October:15 (up to the 15th)

Wait, no, wait. No, because from March 3 to October 15 is the period. So I think I should calculate the days from March 3 to October 15, inclusive? Or up to but not including October 15? Hmm, maybe it's better to calculate the total days covered and then find the refund based on that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the total days in a year and the days elapsed.

Wait, but the annual premium is $130, so the daily rate would be 130 divided by 365 days.

But let's see. From March 3 to October 15.

Wait, I think a better approach is to calculate the number of days between March 3 and October 15.

Let me break it down month by month:

March: from March 3 to March 31: 31 -3 +1 =29 days.

April: 30 days

May:31

June:30

July:31

August:31

September:30

October:15 days (since it's up to the 15th)

Wait, no. Because the policy is canceled on October 15, so that day is the last day of coverage, right? So from March 3 to October 15, that's a total of how many days?

Let me calculate each month:

March: 29 days (as above)

April: 30

May:31

June:30

July:31

August:31

September:30

October:15.

Adding these: 29 +30=59; +31=90; +30=120; +31=151; +31=182; +30=212; +15=227 days.

Wait, let me add again:

March:29

April:30 → 29+30=59

May:31 →59+31=90

June:30 →90+30=120

July:31 →120+31=151

August:31 →151+31=182

September:30 →182+30=212

October:15 →212+15=227 days.

So total days covered: 227 days.

The annual policy is 365 days, so the unused days would be 365 -227 =138 days.

Wait, but wait—wait, the policy started on March 3, so the total policy term is from March 3 to March 2 of the next year. So the total days in the policy would be 365 days (assuming it's not a leap year).

Wait, but the cancellation is on October 15, so the time covered is from March 3 to October 15, which is 227 days, as calculated above.

So the refund would be the amount corresponding to the remaining days: 365-227=138 days.

So the daily rate is $130 /365 = approximately $0.35616 per day.

So the refund would be 138 days * 0.35616 ≈ let's calculate that.

138 * 0.35616. Let me compute this:

First, 100 * 0.35616 =35.616

38 *0.35616: 30 *0.35616=10.6848, 8*0.35616=2.84928 → total 10.6848+2.84928=13.53408.

So 35.616 +13.53408=49.15008. So approximately $49.15.

Looking at the options, option C is $49.51, which is close. Hmm, but wait, perhaps my calculation is a bit off because of rounding.

Wait, let me recalculate more accurately.

130 divided by 365 equals exactly 0.356164383... per day.

Multiply by 138 days:

0.356164383 *138.

Let me compute that:

0.356164383 *100 =35.6164383

0.356164383 *38= let's compute 0.356164383 *30=10.684913

0.356164383 *8=2.84931507

So 10.684913 +2.84931507=13.534228.

So total 35.6164383 +13.534228=49.150666.

So approximately $49.15, which would round to $49.15.

Looking at the options, option C is $49.51, which is a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the days calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the days between March 3 and October 15.

Alternative approach: Use an online calculator or count differently.

Wait, March 3 to March 31 is 29 days.

From April 1 to October 15:

April:30, May:31, June:30, July:31, August:31, September:30, October:15.

So from April to September: 30+31+30+31+31+30 = 183 days.

Plus October's 15 days: 183 +15=198.

So total is 29 (March) +198=227 days. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe the carrier calculates it as the number of months passed, not days. Because sometimes, for simplicity, they might do it monthly.

If that's the case, let's see how many full months have passed.

March: started on the 3rd, so perhaps considered as a full month.

Then April, May, June, July, August, September, and October up to the 15th.

Wait, let's see: from March 3 to March 31 is March.

April is a full month.

May: full.

June: full.

July: full.

August: full.

September: full.

October: up to the 15th, which is half a month? Or maybe considered as a full month if they prorate by months.

Wait, but if the carrier calculates refunds on a monthly basis, perhaps they refund for full months not used. So let me think differently.

The policy was in effect from March 3 to October 15. How many full months is that?

March: from the 3rd, so maybe they count March as a full month.

April: full.

May: full.

June: full.

July: full.

August: full.

September: full.

October: 15 days. So perhaps the carrier only charges for the full months that have passed. So from March 3 to the end of September would be 7 full months (March to September inclusive). Then October would be another month if they charge per month.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: The policy is for 12 months, so the premium is $130 per year. If the policy is canceled after 7 full months, the refund would be for the remaining 5 months.

Wait, but that would be if they cancel after 7 months, but in this case, it's 7 months plus a bit.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is based on the number of months, not days. So, the policy started in March, and was canceled in October.

March is the first month, so from March to October is 8 months? Wait, March (1), April (2), May (3), June (4), July (5), August (6), September (7), October (8). So 8 months have passed.

Wait, no, because the policy started on March 3. If the cancellation is on October 15, then the months that have been fully or partially covered are from March to October. So 8 months in total.

Wait, but the annual premium is for 12 months. So the carrier would have earned the premium for 8 months, and the refund is for the remaining 4 months.

So, the monthly premium would be 130 /12 ≈ $10.8333 per month.

So, 8 months would be 8 *10.8333 ≈ $86.6664.

The total premium is $130, so the refund would be 130 -86.6664 = $43.3336.

But that's not one of the options. The closest would be option E: $58.33, but that's higher. Hmm. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, maybe the carrier charges for each month as a fraction. For example, if a policy is canceled partway through a month, they might charge for that full month.

But the question is about the refund due when the policy is canceled on October 15. So, perhaps the number of full months that have passed is 7 (from March through September), and October is a partial month.

So, the carrier has covered 7 full months and part of the 8th. If they calculate refunds based on full months only, then the refund would be for the remaining 5 months (12-7=5), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to calculate the exact days and then find the refund based on the daily rate.

Earlier calculation gave approximately $49.15, which is close to option C: $49.51.

But wait, maybe I should compute the exact amount without approximating.

Let me compute 130 * (138/365) to find the refund.

Wait, no, wait. The refund is the unused portion, which is 138 days. So the refund would be (138/365)*130.

So 138 *130 = 17,940.

17,940 divided by 365.

Let me compute that.

365 × 49 = 365×50=18,250 minus 365 → 18,250-365=17,885.

So 365 ×49=17,885.

17,940 -17,885=55.

So 49 with a remainder of 55.

55/365 = 0.15068...

So the exact amount is 49 + 55/365 = 49.15068...

So approximately $49.15, which is $49.15. Looking at the options, the closest is option C: $49.51.

Wait, but why is there a slight discrepancy? Maybe because of rounding during the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 138 * 130 /365.

138 *130 = 17,940.

17,940 ÷ 365.

Let me compute 365 × 49 = 17,885.

17,940 -17,885 = 55.

So 55/365 = 0.15068...

So total is 49.15068... So approximately $49.15.

But option C is $49.51, which is about 0.36 higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days.

Wait, let me recount the days from March 3 to October 15.

March 3 to March 31: 29 days (including the 3rd and 31st).

April: 30

May:31

June:30

July:31

August:31

September:30

October:15.

Adding these:

29 +30=59

59 +31=90

90 +30=120

120+31=151

151+31=182

182+30=212

212+15=227 days.

Yes, that's correct.

So 227 days have passed, 138 days remain.

So the refund is 138/365 *130 = 49.15068...

So $49.15, which isn't exactly an option, but option C is $49.51.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the days. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I should include the start and end dates differently. Some people count the start date as day 0, so perhaps I should subtract one day.

Wait, for example, March 3 to March 4 is 1 day, so March 3 to March 3 is 0 days. So, from March 3 to October 15 is 227 days including both start and end dates.

But when calculating the time period, sometimes the end date is not counted. Wait, no, because the policy is canceled on October 15, so coverage ends on that day. So the days covered are up to and including October 15.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the number of days as (end date - start date) +1.

Wait, let me think differently: Using an example, from March 3 to March 4 is 2 days, so 1 day difference but 2 days counted.

So, using that method, the number of days from March 3 to October 15 is:

March:31-3+1=29 days.

April:30

May:31

June:30

July:31

August:31

September:30

October:15.

Same as before: 227 days.

So I think that's correct.

Wait, maybe the insurance company calculates the refund based on the number of months, not days. Let me try that approach.

March is the first month. From March 3 to March 31 is considered as one month.

Then, each subsequent full month until October. So, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, and part of October.

So that's 8 months in total. But because October is only 15 days, perhaps they consider it as an additional month, making it 8 full months, and then the refund is for 4 months (12-8=4).

So, 4 months' refund.

The annual premium is $130, so per month it's 130/12 ≈ $10.8333.

4 months would be 4 ×10.8333 ≈ $43.3333.

But that's not one of the options either.

Hmm, maybe the refund is calculated based on the number of full months passed. So from March 3 to October 15 is 7 full months (March to September), and October is a partial month.

So, 7 full months have passed. The refund would be for the remaining 5 months.

5 ×10.8333 ≈ $54.1665.

Looking at the options, option E is $58.33, which is 7 months' worth (7 ×10.8333=75.8333; 130-75.8333=54.1667). Wait, no, 130 -75.8333=54.1667. So that's approximately $54.17, which isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps the carrier calculates the refund based on short-rate, which might involve a different method. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the policy is being canceled after 7 months and 12 days. Let's compute that.

From March 3 to October 15: 7 months and 12 days.

So, 7 months would be 7 × (130/12) =7 ×10.8333≈75.8333.

12 days would be (12/365)×130≈4.219.

So total used:75.8333 +4.219≈80.052.

Refund would be 130 -80.052≈49.948, which is about $49.95, which is close to option C: $49.51.

Wait, but that's still a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is based on exact days, which would give $49.15, but the closest option is C: $49.51.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the days calculation is correct. Let me try an alternative approach using another method.

Using the date difference calculator:

March 3 to October 15.

March 3 to March 31: 29 days.

April:30, May:31, June:30, July:31, August:31, September:30, October:15.

So total days: 29+30=59; +31=90; +30=120; +31=151; +31=182; +30=212; +15=227 days.

So yes, 227 days.

Thus, the refund is 138 days ×(130/365) =49.15.

Looking at the options, the closest is C: $49.51.

But wait, perhaps the question expects the refund to be calculated using a 360-day year, which is sometimes done in financial calculations.

If the annual premium is based on 360 days, then the daily rate would be 130/360 ≈ $0.3611 per day.

138 days ×0.3611 ≈ 49.86, which is about $49.86, which is still closest to option C: $49.51, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the company uses a different method, like considering each month as 30 days.

So, let's try that approach.

March has 31 days, but perhaps they approximate each month as 30 days.

So, from March 3 to October 15:

March:31-3=28 days remaining, but perhaps they count it as 30 days.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps each month is considered as 1/12 of the year, regardless of the actual days.

So, the number of months elapsed would be from March 3 to October 15.

March: from the 3rd, so 1 month (March) is considered as fully elapsed.

Then April, May, June, July, August, September: that's 6 more months, totaling 7 months.

October: 15 days, which is half a month (since 15 is half of 30
