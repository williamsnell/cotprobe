Question:

A researcher is hoping to find a predictive linear relationship between the explanatory and response variables in her study. Accordingly, as part of her analysis she plans to generate a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line for the two variables. The interval is determined to be (0.45, 0.80). Which of the following is (are) true? (Assume conditions for inference are met.) I. She has good evidence of a linear relationship between the variables. II. It is likely that there is a non-zero correlation (r) between the two variables. III. It is likely that the true slope of the regression line is 0.

Options:

A: I only
B: I, II, and III
C: None of the above
D: I and II only
E: III only
F: II and III only
G: I and III only
H: Only II is likely, while I and III are not
I: II only
J: I and II are likely, but III is not

Okay, so I have this statistics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a researcher who's looking for a predictive linear relationship between two variables. She's planning to create a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line, and the interval she got is (0.45, 0.80). Then there are three statements, I, II, and III, and I need to determine which are true.

Hmm, I remember that a confidence interval for the slope tells us about the likely range of the true slope. Since it's a 95% interval, that means we're 95% confident that the true slope lies within that range, assuming all the conditions are met, which the question says they are.

Looking at the interval (0.45, 0.80), both numbers are positive. So the lower bound is 0.45, upper is 0.80. That suggests that the slope is positive. Wait, but what does that mean for the statements?

Statement I: She has good evidence of a linear relationship between the variables. Well, if the confidence interval doesn't include zero, because zero isn't between 0.45 and 0.80, then that means the slope is statistically significantly different from zero. So we can reject the null hypothesis that the slope is zero. That implies there's a significant linear relationship. So I would say statement I is true.

Statement II: It is likely that there is a non-zero correlation (r) between the two variables. Hmm. The correlation coefficient r measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship. The slope of the regression line is actually r*(sy/sx), where sy is the standard deviation of y and sx of x. So if the slope is non-zero (as our interval suggests), then r can't be zero either. So if the slope isn't zero, then r isn't zero either. So statement II should be true because a non-zero slope implies non-zero correlation.

Statement III: It is likely that the true slope of the regression line is 0. Wait, the confidence interval doesn't include zero. So the interval is entirely above zero. So the likely range for the slope is from 0.45 to 0.80, meaning zero isn't in there. So the true slope being zero is not supported by this interval. Therefore, statement III is false.

So putting that together: I is true, II is true, III is false. Now looking at the options, let's see.

The options are A through J. Let's read the options again.

Option A: I only. But we have I and II true, so A isn't correct.

Option B: I, II, III. No, because III is false.

Option C: None. No, because I and II are true.

Option D: I and II only. That matches our conclusion.

Option E: III only. No, because III is false.

Option F: II and III. No.

Option G: I and III. No.

Option H: Only II. No, because I is also true.

Option I: II only. No, same as H.

Option J: I and II are likely, but III is not. Wait, that's the same as D: I and II only.

Looking back, the answer should be D: I and II only.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The confidence interval being entirely above zero (like 0.45 to 0.80) means that zero isn't in the interval. So the p-value for the slope would be less than 0.05, leading us to reject the null hypothesis of a zero slope. That supports a linear relationship, so I is correct.

And since the slope is non-zero, the correlation r can't be zero either, as r is related to the slope. So II is correct.

III is incorrect because the interval doesn't include zero, so it's unlikely.

So the correct statements are I and II, which is option D.
</think>

The question involves interpreting a 95% confidence interval for the slope of a regression line, given as (0.45, 0.80). This interval does not include zero, which has implications for the three statements provided:

1. **Statement I**: Since the confidence interval does not include zero, there is statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis of a zero slope. This indicates a significant linear relationship between the variables. Therefore, Statement I is true.

2. **Statement II**: A non-zero slope implies that the correlation coefficient \( r \) is also non-zero because the slope is directly related to \( r \) (slope = \( r \cdot \frac{s_y}{s_x} \)). Thus, Statement II is also true.

3. **Statement III**: The confidence interval (0.45, 0.80) does not include zero, meaning the true slope is unlikely to be zero. Therefore, Statement III is false.

Given these conclusions, the correct answer is the option that includes only Statements I and II. 

**Answer: D**
