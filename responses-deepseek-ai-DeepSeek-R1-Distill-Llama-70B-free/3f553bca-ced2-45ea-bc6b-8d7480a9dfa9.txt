Question:

In a group of students, about 36 percent could roll their tongues, a trait determined by a dominant gene. The other 64 percent of the students werenonrollers. Calculate the frequencies of the gene R for tongue rolling and its recessive allele r fornonrolling.

Options:

A: frequency of R = 0.5, frequency of r = 0.5
B: frequency of R = 0.7, frequency of r = 0.3
C: frequency of R = 0.4, frequency of r = 0.6
D: frequency of R = 0.18, frequency of r = 0.82
E: frequency of R = 0.2, frequency of r = 0.8
F: frequency of R = 0.6, frequency of r = 0.4
G: frequency of R = 0.3, frequency of r = 0.7
H: frequency of R = 0.64, frequency of r = 0.36
I: frequency of R = 0.36, frequency of r = 0.64
J: frequency of R = 0.8, frequency of r = 0.2

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see... The question is about calculating gene frequencies for tongue rolling. Hmm, I remember that tongue rolling is a dominant trait. So, the problem says that 36% of the students can roll their tongues, and 64% can't. I need to find the frequencies of the gene R (dominant) and r (recessive).

Wait, I think this has to do with Hardy-Weinberg equations. Oh right, the Hardy-Weinberg principle helps calculate allele frequencies in a population. The equation is p² + 2pq + q² = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (R) and q is the recessive (r). 

So, the first thing I need to figure out is what the percentages represent in terms of genotype. Since the trait is dominant, the 36% who can roll their tongues must have at least one R allele. That means their genotype could be either RR or Rr. The 64% who can't roll are the recessive homozygotes, so their genotype is rr. 

Wait, but how does that translate into allele frequencies? I remember that q² is the frequency of the recessive phenotype. So in this case, q² = 0.64 because 64% can't roll their tongues. So if q² is 0.64, then q must be the square root of 0.64. Let me calculate that. The square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So q, which is the frequency of r, is 0.8.

Now, since p + q = 1, p would be 1 - q. So p = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. So the frequency of R is 0.2 and r is 0.8.

Wait, let me double-check. If R is 0.2, then the dominant genotypes would be RR and Rr. The frequency of RR would be p², which is (0.2)^2 = 0.04. The frequency of Rr would be 2pq, which is 2 * 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.32. So the total frequency of dominant traits is 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36, which is 36%, matching the question. Oh that makes sense.

So looking at the options, I need to find R=0.2 and r=0.8. Scanning the options, option E says R=0.2, r=0.8. So that's the correct choice.

To calculate the frequencies of the gene R (dominant) and r (recessive) for tongue rolling, we use the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The problem states that 36% of the students can roll their tongues (dominant phenotype) and 64% cannot (recessive phenotype). 

1. **Determine q (frequency of r):**  
   The recessive phenotype (non-rollers) corresponds to the genotype rr, and its frequency is given as 64% or 0.64. Since \( q^2 = 0.64 \), taking the square root gives \( q = 0.8 \).

2. **Determine p (frequency of R):**  
   Using the relationship \( p + q = 1 \), we find \( p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 \).

3. **Verify the calculations:**  
   - Frequency of RR (homozygous dominant): \( p^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04 \).  
   - Frequency of Rr (heterozygous): \( 2pq = 2(0.2)(0.8) = 0.32 \).  
   - Total frequency of the dominant phenotype (rollers): \( p^2 + 2pq = 0.04 + 0.32 = 0.36 \), which matches the given 36%.  

Thus, the frequency of R is 0.2, and the frequency of r is 0.8. Comparing this with the options, the correct answer is:

**E: frequency of R = 0.2, frequency of r = 0.8.**
