Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about freezing point depression. Hmm, I remember that when a solute dissolves in a solvent, it can lower the freezing point. The formula for freezing point depression is ΔTf = i * Kf * m, right? Where ΔTf is the change in freezing point, i is the van't Hoff factor, Kf is the freezing point depression constant, and m is the molality of the solution.

The problem says that the solution is 0.0100 m AB, and the freezing point is -0.0193°C. Wait, water's normal freezing point is 0°C, so the change here is -0.0193°C. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, the freezing point of the solution is lower than that of pure water, so the ΔTf is the difference. So, yes, ΔTf is 0.0193°C, because the solution freezes at a lower temperature.

The Kf for water is given as -1.86°C·kg/mol. Wait, but in the formula, Kf is a positive value, and the ΔTf is negative because it's a lowering. Oh wait, maybe the problem states it as -1.86, but when using it in the formula, we take the magnitude. Or perhaps I should be careful with signs.

So the formula is ΔTf = i * Kf * m. Wait, the Kf is given as -1.86°C per mole, but I think that's just a way of expressing that the freezing point decreases. So in calculations, we can use the absolute value.

Let me plug in the numbers. ΔTf is 0.0193°C. Kf is 1.86°C·kg/mol. The solution is 0.0100 m, which is the molality. But wait, the solute is AB, which dissociates into A and B. So the van't Hoff factor i will depend on how many particles it dissociates into.

AB is a strong electrolyte, I think, because it's dissociating in water. So AB → A+ + B-. So each formula unit of AB produces two particles. So i is 2.

Wait, but the question is about the percent dissociation. Oh, right, because AB may not dissociate completely. So the actual i is less than 2. Hmm, I need to find the degree of dissociation, which affects the van't Hoff factor.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula I remember is that the observed freezing point depression (ΔTf observed) equals the theoretical freezing point depression multiplied by the degree of dissociation. Or maybe not exactly. Let me think again.

The formula is ΔTf = i * Kf * m. But in this case, i is the number of particles the solute dissociates into. If AB dissociates into two ions, each mole of AB gives two moles of particles. But if it's only partially dissociated, then the actual i would be 1 + α, where α is the degree of dissociation. Wait, no, because for AB dissociating into A+ and B-, the expression is:

For each mole of AB that dissociates, you get 1 mole of A+ and 1 mole of B-, so a total of 2 moles of ions. So the total number of particles is (1 - α)*1 (the undissociated AB) plus 2*α (the dissociated ions). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Alternatively, the van't Hoff factor i is equal to the number of particles after dissociation. So for AB dissociating as AB → A+ + B-, the i is 2 if it completely dissociates, but if it only partially dissociates, say by a fraction α, then the total number of particles is 1*(1 - α) (for the AB that remains) plus 2*α (for each AB that dissociates into two ions). So i = (1 - α) + 2α = 1 + α.

Wait, but in the case of strong electrolytes that completely dissociate, α is 1, so i=2. For weak electrolytes, α is less than one, so i is between 1 and 2.

But in the problem, the solution is 0.0100 m AB, so the initial molality is 0.0100 before dissociation. Let me clarify:

The formula for freezing point depression is ΔTf = i * Kf * m. But here, m is the molality of the solute before dissociation. Or is it the total molality after dissociation?

Wait, no, the m in the formula is the molality of the solute, which is the same as the molality of the solution. So for a solution of AB with a molality of 0.0100 m, when it dissociates into A+ and B-, each at 0.0100 * α m, but the total number of particles is 0.0100*(1 + α). Because each mole of AB that dissociates produces two ions.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it this way: the van't Hoff factor i is the number of particles per formula unit after dissociation. So for AB, i = 2 (since AB → A+ + B-). But because AB doesn't completely dissociate, the actual i is less than 2. So let me model it.

Let’s say the initial concentration of AB is 0.0100 m. Let the degree of dissociation be α. Then, the concentration of AB that dissociates is α * 0.0100 m, producing α * 0.0100 m of A+ and the same for B-. The remaining AB is (1 - α) * 0.0100 m.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because for every mole of AB that dissociates, you get one mole of A+ and one of B-. So the total number of particles after dissociation is (1 - α)*0.0100 (from undissociated AB) + 2*(α * 0.0100) (ions from dissociated AB).

So the total molality of particles is 0.0100*(1 - α) + 0.0200*α = 0.0100*(1 + α).

Wait, no, wait: Let me compute it step by step.

Total moles of AB initially: 0.0100 moles per kg.

After dissociation: (1 - α) * 0.0100 remains as AB.

Each AB that dissociates becomes A+ and B-, so 0.0100 * α of AB becomes 0.0100 * α of A+ and same for B-. So total of 0.0100 * α * 2 = 0.0200 * α moles of ions.

Wait, no. Wait, the total moles after dissociation would be:

Moles of AB: 0.0100 (1 - α)
Moles of A+ : 0.0100 α
Moles of B- : 0.0100 α
Total moles = 0.0100 (1 - α) + 0.0100 α + 0.0100 α = 0.0100 (1 - α + 2α) )= 0.0100 (1 + α).

So the total molality is 0.0100 (1 + α) m.

So the van't Hoff factor i is (1 + α). Because each mole of AB contributes (1 + α) moles of particles.

So the freezing point depression is ΔTf = i * Kf * m.

Wait, but in the formula, m is the molality of the solute, which is 0.0100 m. But in the presence of dissociation, the effective molality is higher because of more particles. So the formula would use i multiplied by m (the initial molality of AB) because each mole contributes i particles.

So putting it all together:

ΔTf = i * Kf * m
ΔTf = (1 + α) * Kf * (0.0100 m)

We know ΔTf is 0.0193°C, Kf is 1.86°C·kg/mol (using the magnitude, ignoring the negative sign because it's just the value needed for calculation), and m is 0.0100.

So plug in:

0.0193 = (1 + α) * 1.86 * 0.0100

Let me compute the right side.

First, 1.86 * 0.0100 = 0.0186.

So 0.0193 = (1 + α) * 0.0186.

Divide both sides by 0.0186:

(0.0193) / 0.0186 = 1 + α.

Let me compute that: 0.0193 / 0.0186 ≈ 1.0376.

So 1.0376 = 1 + α → α = 0.0376, or about 3.76%.

Wait, that's approximately 3.76% dissociation. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, wait, let me compute 0.0193 divided by 0.0186 accurately.

0.0193 / 0.0186: Let me write it as 193 / 186 (since both multiplied by 10000 to eliminate decimals).

193 ÷ 186 = approx 1.0376.

Yes, so that's 1.0376. So 1 + alpha = 1.0376 → alpha = 0.0376 → 3.76%.

So the percentage dissociation is approximately 3.76%. Looking at the options, option H is 3%, option I is 5%, so which is closer? 3.76 is closer to 4%, but the options don't have 4% as the correct answer. Wait, looking at the options, option H is 3%, option F is 4%. Wait, the options are:

Options:

A:12%, B:6%, C:8%, D:10%, E:2%, F:4%, G:15%, H:3%, I:5%, J:7%.

So 3.76% is approximately 4%, which is option F.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, the van't Hoff factor i for AB dissociating into two ions is 2 if fully dissociated, but when partially dissociated, it's (1 + α). So the formula is ΔTf = (1 + α) * Kf * m.

Wait, let me make sure that m is the molality of AB before dissociation. So yes, correct.

So the equation is 0.0193 = (1 + α) * 1.86 * 0.0100.

1.86 * 0.0100 is 0.0186.

So 0.0193 / 0.0186 = 1.0376 = 1 + α → α = 0.0376 → 3.76%, which is about 3.8%, so closer to 4%. So the answer should be F:4%.

Wait, but wait, another approach: perhaps I should consider that the molality after dissociation is m * i, so i is (1 + α). So the equation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me think again.

Another approach: The freezing point depression is given by ΔTf = Kf * m * i, where i is the van't Hoff factor, which for AB is 2 if fully dissociated. But if it's only partially dissociated, then the effective i is 1 + α, where α is the degree of dissociation.

So, solving for i:

i = (ΔTf) / (Kf * m)

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔTf = 0.0193°C
Kf = 1.86°C·kg/mol
m = 0.0100 mol/kg.

So i = 0.0193 / (1.86 * 0.0100) = 0.0193 / 0.0186 ≈ 1.0376.

But i is 1 + α, so 1.0376 = 1 + α → α ≈ 0.0376 → 3.76% dissociation.

So again, 3.76% is close to 4%, which is option F.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 3%, which is a little lower. Could there be a mistake in my calculation?

Let me compute 0.0193 divided by 0.0186 more accurately.

0.0193 / 0.0186 = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

First, 0.0193 / 0.0186: Let's multiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to eliminate decimals: 193 / 186.

186 × 1 = 186 → 193-186=7 → 7/186 ≈ 0.0376.

So 1.0376, which is 1.0376, so 3.76% as I calculated.

So the closest option is F:4%.

Wait, but the options have F as 4%, H as 3%. So perhaps the correct answer is F.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating i. Because in another approach, the solution is 0.0100 m in AB, which dissociates into A+ and B-. So the total molality would be 0.0100 * (1 + α). So the formula is ΔTf = Kf * (0.0100) * (1 + α).

Wait, that's the same as what I did before. So it's correct.

So unless I made a mistake in the calculation, the answer should be about 3.76%, closest to 4%, option F.

Wait, but the options also have option I as 5%. Let me check if I perhaps miscalculated.

Wait, wait, let me compute 0.0193 / (1.86 * 0.0100) again.

1.86 * 0.0100 = 0.0186.

0.0193 / 0.0186 = ?

Let me compute 0.0186 × 1.04 = 0.0186 * 1 = 0.0186, 0.0186 * 0.04 = 0.000744. So 0.0186 + 0.000744 = 0.019344, which is a bit higher than 0.0193.

So 0.0186 * 1.04 = 0.019344.

But our ΔTf is 0.0193, which is a little less than 0.019344. So 1.04 would give 0.019344, which is just a bit higher than 0.0193. So the actual value is a little less than 1.04, so around 1.0376.

Which would mean alpha is about 3.76%.

So the closest option is F:4%.

But wait, the answer choices don't have a 4% option near the top. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A:12%, B:6%, C:8%, D:10%, E:2%, F:4%, G:15%, H:3%, I:5%, J:7%.

So yes, F is 4%, which is correct.

To determine the percentage dissociation of AB in the solution, we use the freezing point depression formula:

\[
\Delta T_f = i \cdot K_f \cdot m
\]

Where:
- \(\Delta T_f = 0.0193^\circ \text{C}\) (freezing point depression),
- \(K_f = 1.86^\circ \text{C·kg/mol}\) (freezing point depression constant of water),
- \(m = 0.0100 \, \text{mol/kg}\) (molality of the solution),
- \(i\) is the van't Hoff factor, which depends on the degree of dissociation (\(\alpha\)).

For AB dissociating as \(AB \rightarrow A^+ + B^-\), the van't Hoff factor is given by:

\[
i = 1 + \alpha
\]

Substituting into the formula:

\[
\Delta T_f = (1 + \alpha) \cdot K_f \cdot m
\]

Rearranging to solve for \(1 + \alpha\):

\[
1 + \alpha = \frac{\Delta T_f}{K_f \cdot m}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
1 + \alpha = \frac{0.0193}{1.86 \cdot 0.0100} = \frac{0.0193}{0.0186} \approx 1.0376
\]

Thus:

\[
\alpha = 1.0376 - 1 = 0.0376 \, \text{or} \, 3.76\%
\]

The degree of dissociation is approximately \(3.76\%\). Among the given options, the closest value is \(4\%\).
