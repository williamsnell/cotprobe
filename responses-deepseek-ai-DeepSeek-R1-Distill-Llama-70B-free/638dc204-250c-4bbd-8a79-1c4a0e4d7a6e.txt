Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the smallest positive integer that leaves specific remainders when divided by 5, 7, and 9. Let me see... Okay, the problem says:

- The number leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5.
- It leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 7.
- And a remainder of 2 when divided by 9.

Hmm, I remember that this is a problem involving the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which deals with solving systems of congruences. But I'm not too familiar with the exact method, so I'll have to think it through step by step.

Let me break it down. Let's say the number we're looking for is N. So according to the problem:

N ≡ 3 mod 5  
N ≡ 4 mod 7  
N ≡ 2 mod 9  

I need to find the smallest N that satisfies all three conditions.

Maybe I can approach this by solving two congruences at a time and then combining the results. Let me start with the first two conditions.

First, N ≡ 3 mod 5. That means N can be written as 5k + 3 for some integer k. Let's substitute this into the second condition.

So, substituting into N ≡4 mod7:

5k + 3 ≡4 mod7  
Subtracting 3 from both sides gives:  
5k ≡1 mod7  

Now I need to solve for k here. 5k ≡1 mod7. Hmm, what's the inverse of 5 modulo 7? Because I need to multiply both sides by the inverse of 5 to find k.

Let me think: 5 * x ≡1 mod7. Trying x=3: 5*3=15, which mod7 is 1. Oh, right, because 15-14=1. So x=3 is the inverse.

So multiplying both sides by 3:

k ≡3*1 mod7  
k ≡3 mod7  

So k can be written as 7m +3 for some integer m. 

Now substitute back into N=5k+3:  
N=5*(7m +3) +3 = 35m +15 +3 = 35m +18.

So now, N ≡18 mod35. Now, this N must also satisfy the third condition, which is N ≡2 mod9.

So let's set up the equation:  
35m +18 ≡2 mod9  

Let me compute 35 mod9 first. 9*3=27, 35-27=8. So 35 ≡8 mod9. And 18 mod9 is 0, since 9*2=18. So substituting:

8m + 0 ≡2 mod9  
So 8m ≡2 mod9  

Now I need to solve for m. Let's find the inverse of 8 mod9. Because 8 and 9 are coprime, the inverse exists. Let's see, 8* x ≡1 mod9.

Testing x=8: 8*8=64 → 64 mod9: 9*7=63, 64-63=1. So x=8 is the inverse.

Multiply both sides by 8:  
m ≡2*8 mod9  
m ≡16 mod9 → 16-9=7, so m≡7 mod9.

So m can be written as 9n +7 for some integer n. 

Substituting back into N=35m +18:  
N=35*(9n +7) +18 = 315n + 245 +18 = 315n +263.

So the smallest positive integer occurs when n=0: N=263. Wait, but let me check if that's correct.

Wait, n=0 gives N=263. Let me check if 263 satisfies all the conditions.

First condition: 263 divided by5. 5*52=260, 263-260=3. So yes, remainder 3.

Second condition: 263 divided by7. Let's see, 7*37=259, 263-259=4. So remainder 4. Good.

Third condition: 263 divided by9. 9*29=261, 263-261=2. So remainder 2. Perfect.

So 263 is the smallest positive integer that meets all three conditions.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option D is 263. So the answer should be D.

But wait, let me double-check to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I should check another possible number, like when n=1: 315+263=578. But since 263 is smaller, that's the answer.

Alternatively, let's see if any smaller number in the options satisfies the conditions.

Looking at the options: The options are A:142, B:173, C:372, D:263, E:52, F:289, G:105, H:324, I:233, J:210.

I can check each to see if any is smaller than 263 and satisfies all conditions.

Let's check option E:52. 

52 mod5: 52-50=2. So remainder 2, but we need 3. So no.

Option G:105. 105 mod5 is 0, since 105 is divisible by5. Not 3. So no.

Option I:233. Let's check:

233 mod5: 5*46=230, 233-230=3 → good.

233 mod7: 7*33=231, 233-231=2 → but we need remainder 4. So no. So 233 doesn't work.

Option J:210. 210 mod5 is 0 → no.

Option A:142. mod5: 140 is 28*5, so 142-140=2 → remainder2. Not 3. So no.

Option B:173. mod5: 5*34=170, 173-170=3 → good.

mod7: 7*24=168, 173-168=5 → need 4. So no.

Option C:372. Let's see:

mod5: 372-370=2 → no.

Option F:289. mod5: 285 is 57*5, 289-285=4 → no.

Option H:324. mod5: 324 ends with 4, 4 mod5 is 4. So remainder 4, but we need 3. So no.

So the only number that meets all conditions is D:263.

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( N \) that satisfies the following conditions:

1. \( N \equiv 3 \mod 5 \)
2. \( N \equiv 4 \mod 7 \)
3. \( N \equiv 2 \mod 9 \)

### Step 1: Solve the first two congruences
From \( N \equiv 3 \mod 5 \), we can express \( N \) as:
\[
N = 5k + 3
\]
Substituting this into \( N \equiv 4 \mod 7 \):
\[
5k + 3 \equiv 4 \mod 7
\]
Simplifying:
\[
5k \equiv 1 \mod 7
\]
The modular inverse of 5 modulo 7 is 3 (since \( 5 \cdot 3 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)). Multiplying both sides by 3:
\[
k \equiv 3 \mod 7
\]
Thus, \( k = 7m + 3 \) for some integer \( m \). Substituting back into \( N = 5k + 3 \):
\[
N = 5(7m + 3) + 3 = 35m + 18
\]
So, \( N \equiv 18 \mod 35 \).

### Step 2: Solve for the third congruence
Now, \( N = 35m + 18 \) must satisfy \( N \equiv 2 \mod 9 \). Substituting:
\[
35m + 18 \equiv 2 \mod 9
\]
Simplifying:
\[
8m \equiv 2 \mod 9
\]
The modular inverse of 8 modulo 9 is 8 (since \( 8 \cdot 8 \equiv 1 \mod 9 \)). Multiplying both sides by 8:
\[
m \equiv 16 \mod 9 \implies m \equiv 7 \mod 9
\]
Thus, \( m = 9n + 7 \) for some integer \( n \). Substituting back into \( N = 35m + 18 \):
\[
N = 35(9n + 7) + 18 = 315n + 263
\]
The smallest positive integer occurs when \( n = 0 \), giving \( N = 263 \).

### Step 3: Verify \( N = 263 \)
- \( 263 \div 5 = 52 \) remainder 3: \( 263 \equiv 3 \mod 5 \)
- \( 263 \div 7 = 37 \) remainder 4: \( 263 \equiv 4 \mod 7 \)
- \( 263 \div 9 = 29 \) remainder 2: \( 263 \equiv 2 \mod 9 \)

All conditions are satisfied.

### Step 4: Check the options
From the given options, \( 263 \) corresponds to option **D**. None of the other options satisfy all three conditions.

**Answer: D**
