Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the 5th term in a series. Let me read it again carefully. The first term is 2, and each subsequent term is -2 multiplied by the preceding term. Hmm, okay, so it's like a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by a common ratio.

Wait, right, in a geometric sequence, each term is the previous term multiplied by a constant ratio. So here, that ratio is -2. That makes sense. So the first term is 2. Let me think about how the series progresses.

Let me write down the terms one by one to visualize it better. The first term is given as 2. So term 1 is 2. Then term 2 is -2 multiplied by term 1. So term 2 = -2 * 2. Let me compute that: -2 times 2 is -4. Okay, so term 2 is -4.

Now, term 3 would be -2 multiplied by term 2, which is -4. So term 3 = -2 * (-4). Multiplying two negatives gives a positive, so that's 8. Got it, term 3 is 8.

Moving on to term 4: that's -2 multiplied by term 3, which is 8. So term 4 = -2 * 8 = -16. So term 4 is -16.

Then term 5 is -2 multiplied by term 4. Term 4 is -16, so term 5 = -2 * (-16). Again, two negatives make a positive, so that's 32. So term 5 is 32.

Wait, let me double-check that. Let me list them out:

Term 1: 2

Term 2: 2 * (-2) = -4

Term 3: -4 * (-2) = 8

Term 4: 8 * (-2) = -16

Term 5: -16 * (-2) = 32

Yes, that looks right. So the fifth term is 32.

Looking at the options, I need to find which letter corresponds to 32. The options are:

A: −16

B:16

C:32

D:−256

E:−32

F:−128

G:256

H:128

I:64

J:−64

So option C is 32. So the correct answer should be C.

The series starts with the first term as 2, and each subsequent term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by -2. Calculating each term step by step:

- Term 1: 2  
- Term 2: \( 2 \times (-2) = -4 \)  
- Term 3: \( -4 \times (-2) = 8 \)  
- Term 4: \( 8 \times (-2) = -16 \)  
- Term 5: \( -16 \times (-2) = 32 \)  

Thus, the 5th term is 32. From the given options, 32 corresponds to option C.
