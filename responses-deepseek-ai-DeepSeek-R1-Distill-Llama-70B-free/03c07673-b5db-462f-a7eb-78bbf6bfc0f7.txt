Okay, so I've got this problem here about LeroiWilson and his belt business. I need to find his gross revenue for the week. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that gross revenue is basically the total money made from sales before any expenses or costs. So, I think I just need to calculate how many belts he sold in total during the six days and then multiply that by the price per belt.

The problem says he gets $2.80 per belt. So, the formula would be Total Revenue = (Total Belts Made) * (Price per Belt). 

Let me get the numbers of belts he made each day:

- Monday: 56
- Tuesday: 126
- Wednesday: 130
- Thursday: 110
- Friday: 118
- Saturday: 56

I need to add all these up. Let me do that step by step to avoid mistakes.

Starting with Monday and Tuesday: 56 + 126 = 182.

Adding Wednesday's 130: 182 + 130 = 312.

Then Thursday's 110: 312 +110 = 422.

Friday adds 118: 422 + 118 = 540.

And Saturday is another 56: 540 +56 = 596.

Wait, let me double-check that sum to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me add them all again:

56 (Mon) +126 (Tue) = 182. Plus Wednesday 130 makes 312. Thursday is 110, so 312 +110 = 422. Friday adds 118, so 422 +118 = 540. Saturday 56: 540 +56 = 596. Yeah, that seems right.

So total belts are 596. Now multiply by $2.80 per belt.

Hmm, 596 * 2.80. Let me think about how to calculate that. Maybe break it down.

I can think of 2.80 as 2 + 0.80. So 596 * 2 = 1192. Then 596 * 0.80 is... let's see, 596 * 0.8. 0.8 is 4/5, so 596 * 4 = 2384, divided by 5 is 476.8. So 1192 + 476.8 = 1668.8.

Wait, so $1,668.80. Let me check the options. Option E is $1,668.80. So that must be the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I added the belts correctly. Did I add them right?

Monday:56, Tuesday:126 (total 182), Wednesday:130 (312), Thursday:110 (422), Friday:118 (540), Saturday:56 (596). Yes, that's correct.

And 596 * 2.8. Alternatively, maybe compute 596 * 2.8 as:

596 * 2 = 1192.

596 * 0.8 = 476.8.

Adding gives 1192 + 476.8 = 1668.8, which is $1,668.80. So yes, that's correct.

Looking back at the options, option E is $1,668.80. So the answer should be E.

To determine LeroiWilson's gross revenue for the week, we calculate the total number of belts he made and multiply by the price per belt. The total belts made during the six days are:

- Monday: 56  
- Tuesday: 126  
- Wednesday: 130  
- Thursday: 110  
- Friday: 118  
- Saturday: 56  

Adding these together:  
56 + 126 = 182  
182 + 130 = 312  
312 + 110 = 422  
422 + 118 = 540  
540 + 56 = 596  

LeroiWilson made a total of **596 belts**. At $2.80 per belt, the gross revenue is:  
596 * 2.80 = $1,668.80  

Thus, the correct answer is **E: $1,668.80**.
