Question:

On January 1, 1964, Stead and Company purchased a delivery truck for $4,000. It is estimated that the truck will have a useful life of four years, and that at the end of that time it will have a salvage value (resale value) of $400. It is expected that the truck will be used for 72,000 miles. Find the depreciation per year, if the truck was used for 20,000 miles during the first year, 25,000 miles during the second year, 18,000 miles during the third year and 9,000 miles during the fourth year. Use the units of production method for determining depreciation.

Options:

A: $1,500.00
B: $1,000.00
C: $2,000.00
D: $1,200.00
E: $2,500.00
F: $2,400.00
G: $1,800.00
H: $3,600.00
I: $2,800.00
J: $4,000.00

Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about depreciation using the units of production method. Hmm, I remember that the units of production method bases depreciation on how much the asset is used each year rather than a fixed annual amount. Let me think through this carefully.

The problem states that Stead and Company bought a delivery truck for $4,000 on January 1, 1964. The useful life is four years, and the salvage value is $400. The total expected mileage is 72,000 miles. 

So, the first thing I need to calculate is the total depreciation over the life of the truck. Since the salvage value is $400, the depreciable amount would be the cost minus the salvage value. That's $4,000 minus $400, which equals $3,600. 

Next, the total units of production are 72,000 miles. The depreciation rate per mile would be the depreciable amount divided by total miles. So, $3,600 divided by 72,000 miles. Let me compute that: 3600 / 72000 = 0.05. So each mile depreciates the truck by $0.05.

Now, I need to find the depreciation for each year based on the miles driven each year. Let's break it down:

Year 1: 20,000 miles. Depreciation = 20,000 * 0.05 = $1,000.
Year 2: 25,000 miles. Depreciation = 25,000 * 0.05 = $1,250.
Year 3: 18,000 miles. Depreciation = 18,000 * 0.05 = $900.
Year 4: 9,000 miles. Depreciation = 9,000 * 0.05 = $450.

Wait, but the question is asking for the depreciation per year. Oh, wait, no—the question is to find the depreciation for each year, but the options are given as a single answer. Wait, no, actually, the question says "find the depreciation per year" but then gives multiple-choice options, each with a single value. Oh, wait, maybe I misunderstood. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says, "Find the depreciation per year." But then the options are all single amounts. Wait, that's confusing. No, perhaps I'm misreading it. Wait, the question is asking for the depreciation per year, but perhaps it's considering the annual depreciation calculated using the units of production method, which varies each year. Oh, but the options are all single numbers. Hmm, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the total depreciation over the four years, but that's $3,600 total. But none of the options are that.

Wait, no, maybe the question is asking for the rate per unit, but no, the options are in dollars. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the depreciation for each year, but the problem is that each year's depreciation is different. But the options are individual values, so perhaps each year's depreciation is one of the options. Wait, but the question is phrased as "find the depreciation per year," which might be the annual rate, but under units of production, it's not a fixed amount per year. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the depreciation per unit, but that would be per mile, which is $0.05.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the depreciation per year, but using the units of production method, so each year's depreciation varies. However, the options provided are single values, so perhaps the question is asking for the total depreciation over four years, but that's $3,600, which is option F. Or perhaps the question is asking for the depreciation for the first year, which is $1,000. Let me check the options: option B is $1,000. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the method, so let me make sure I applied it correctly.

Another approach: the units of production method calculates depreciation by multiplying the units produced in a period by the depreciation per unit. The depreciation per unit is (Cost - Salvage Value) / Total Units. So, (4000-400)/72000 = 3600/72000 = 0.05 per mile. Then, each year's depreciation is miles driven times 0.05.

So for each year:

Year 1: 20,000 * 0.05 = 1,000 → option B.
Year 2: 25,000 * 0.05 = 1,250 → not an option.
Year 3: 18,000 * 0.05 = 900 → not an option.
Year 4: 9,000 * 0.05 = 450 → not an option.

But the question is phrased as "Find the depreciation per year," which could imply that each year's depreciation is being asked, but the options only include one of the years' amounts. Alternatively, perhaps the question is misworded, and they're asking for the rate per unit, but that's not what the options suggest.

Wait, maybe the question is actually asking for the total depreciation over the four years, but that would be $3,600, which is option F. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the average annual depreciation, but that would be 3600/4 = $900, which isn't an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps I should sum the annual deprecations to see if it aligns with any option. Let's compute each year's:

Year 1: 20,000 * 0.05 = $1,000
Year 2: 25,000 * 0.05 = $1,250
Year 3: 18,000 * 0.05 = $900
Year 4: 9,000 * 0.05 = $450
Total: 1,000 + 1,250 + 900 + 450 = 3,600. That adds up correctly.

But the options don't have 3,600 except option F. So perhaps the question is asking for the total depreciation over the four years. But the question states, "find the depreciation per year." Hmm, that's confusing. 

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the depreciation per year on average, but that's not the units of production method. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the rate per unit, which is $0.05 per mile, but that's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again: "Find the depreciation per year, if the truck was used for..." So, each year, the depreciation is calculated based on the miles for that year. So the depreciation each year varies. But the options are single values, so perhaps the question is only asking about the depreciation for the first year, which is $1,000. Option B.

But the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the annual depreciation under straight-line, but no, the question specifies units of production. So I think the correct approach is to calculate each year's depreciation, but since the options are single values, perhaps the question is asking for the first year's depreciation, which is $1,000, B.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is mistakenly phrased, and it's asking for the total depreciation, which is F. But given the context, I think the intended answer is the first year's depreciation, which is $1,000, option B.

Wait, no, wait. The question says, "Find the depreciation per year," which might be interpreted as the rate per year, but under units of production, it's not a fixed rate. So perhaps the answer is the total depreciation per year on average, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the rate per mile multiplied by the total miles per year, but that's the same as calculating each year's depreciation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is just trying to get the rate per mile, but again, that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible options. The first year's depreciation is $1,000, which is option B. The total depreciation is $3,600, which is F. So which one is the correct answer?

The question is about the units of production method, which assigns depreciation based on usage each year. So the depreciation per year varies each year. But the question is phrased as "Find the depreciation per year," which is a bit ambiguous. But looking at the options, perhaps the intended correct answer is the total depreciation over four years, which is $3,600, option F.

Wait, no, because the question says, "if the truck was used for...", which implies that the usage varies each year, so the depreciation per year would vary. But the options don't have the individual years except for the first year. So perhaps the intended answer is the first year's depreciation, which is $1,000, option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the rate per unit, but that's $0.05 per mile, which isn't an option. So I think the correct approach is that the first year's depreciation is $1,000, so the answer is B.
</think>

To determine the depreciation per year using the units of production method, the following steps were taken:

1. **Calculate the depreciable amount**:  
   The cost of the truck is $4,000, and the salvage value is $400. Therefore, the depreciable amount is:  
   \[
   \text{Depreciable Amount} = \text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value} = \$4,000 - \$400 = \$3,600.
   \]

2. **Determine the depreciation rate per mile**:  
   The truck is expected to be used for 72,000 miles over its useful life. The depreciation rate per mile is:  
   \[
   \text{Depreciation Rate per Mile} = \frac{\text{Depreciable Amount}}{\text{Total Miles}} = \frac{\$3,600}{72,000} = \$0.05 \text{ per mile}.
   \]

3. **Calculate depreciation for each year**:  
   Depreciation for each year is calculated by multiplying the miles driven during that year by the depreciation rate per mile:  
   - **Year 1**:  
     \[
     \text{Depreciation} = 20,000 \text{ miles} \times \$0.05 = \$1,000.
     \]
   - **Year 2**:  
     \[
     \text{Depreciation} = 25,000 \text{ miles} \times \$0.05 = \$1,250.
     \]
   - **Year 3**:  
     \[
     \text{Depreciation} = 18,000 \text{ miles} \times \$0.05 = \$900.
     \]
   - **Year 4**:  
     \[
     \text{Depreciation} = 9,000 \text{ miles} \times \$0.05 = \$450.
     \]

4. **Total Depreciation**:  
   The total depreciation over the four years is:  
   \[
   \text{Total Depreciation} = \$1,000 + \$1,250 + \$900 + \$450 = \$3,600.
   \]

5. **Interpretation of the Question**:  
   The question asks for "the depreciation per year." However, the units of production method results in varying depreciation amounts each year based on mileage. The options provided are single values, which suggests the question may be asking for the depreciation for the first year or the total depreciation over the four years.  
   - The depreciation for the first year is **\$1,000** (Option B).  
   - The total depreciation over the four years is **\$3,600** (Option F).  

Given the phrasing of the question and the options provided, the most likely interpretation is that it is asking for the depreciation for the first year. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: \$1,000.00**

B
