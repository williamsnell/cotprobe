Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

So, there's a bricklayer, and his mate is 10 feet below him. The mate is tossing bricks vertically upward to the bricklayer. When the bricks reach the bricklayer, their speed is 6 ft/s. The question is asking what percentage of the energy used by the mate serves no useful purpose. The options are A to J, each with different percentages.

Hmm, I think this has to do with energy conservation and maybe kinetic and potential energy. Oh right, when the mate throws the brick upwards, he's expending energy to give the brick both kinetic energy and to lift it against gravity. But some of that energy might not be useful. Wait, useful purpose here probably refers to the kinetic energy the brick has when it reaches the bricklayer. Or maybe it's the other way around; maybe the energy used that doesn't contribute to the brick's kinetic energy is the one that's wasted.

Wait, let me think. The mate is doing work in two ways: first, giving the brick kinetic energy so it can move upward, and second, lifting the brick against gravity to the height where the bricklayer is. But if the brick has kinetic energy when it reaches the bricklayer, then part of the mate's energy went into that, and the rest went into lifting it. But perhaps the energy that goes into lifting the brick is useful in the sense that it's needed to get the brick up there, while the kinetic energy is maybe not useful because the brick might just be caught and not use that energy. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite. Let me clarify.

Wait, the problem states that the bricks have a speed of 6 ft/s when they reach the bricklayer. So, the mate's energy is used to do two things: increase the brick's kinetic energy (from 0 to 6 ft/s) and to increase its potential energy (from the lower position to the higher position, 10 feet up). But wait, no, the mate is 10 feet below the bricklayer, so when the brick is thrown upwards, it moves up 10 feet to reach the bricklayer. So the total change in height is 10 feet.

So the energy the mate uses is the work done to accelerate the brick to a certain velocity, which would determine both its kinetic energy and the potential energy gained from lifting.

Wait, but how does this relate to the energy used? Let's model this. The mate applies some initial velocity to the brick, which then travels upwards, slows down due to gravity, and arrives at the bricklayer's height with a speed of 6 ft/s.

Wait, but in the problem, the brick is tossed vertically upward, so it's moving against gravity. So the initial velocity must be higher than 6 ft/s because as it goes up, gravity slows it down. But wait, no, the brick starts from the mate's position, which is 10 feet below. So when the brick reaches the bricklayer, it's moving upward with 6 ft/s. So I think I need to find the initial velocity the mate gives to the brick, and then calculate the kinetic energy at the start and at the end, along with the potential energy change.

The total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) at the start should equal that at the end, assuming no energy loss (like air resistance, which is probably negligible here, as the problem doesn't mention it).

Wait, but the problem is about the percentage of energy used that serves no useful purpose. So maybe the useful energy is the potential energy gained, and the kinetic energy is either useful or not. Or perhaps the other way around. Wait, when the brick is caught by the bricklayer, its kinetic energy is then dissipated (as heat or work in stopping the brick), so perhaps that energy is 'wasted' because it doesn't contribute to the brick being in the higher position. Alternatively, from the mate's perspective, the useful energy is lifting the brick, and the kinetic energy is what's left over after that.

Wait, the mate's energy expenditure goes into two parts: the kinetic energy given to the brick and the potential energy to lift it 10 feet. But when the brick reaches the bricklayer, it still has kinetic energy (6 ft/s). So that kinetic energy isn't being used for anything useful, perhaps, because the brick is moving and then has to be stopped, which would involve work being done to stop it. So the energy that the mate used to give the brick that final kinetic energy is 'wasted' because the bricklayer just needs the brick to be there, not moving. So the useful energy is the potential energy change, and the kinetic energy at the top is the wasted part.

So, the plan is:

1. Calculate the initial velocity given by the mate (let's call it v0).
2. Use energy conservation to find the initial kinetic energy and the final kinetic and potential energies.
3. The useful energy is the potential energy gained (mgh).
4. The initial kinetic energy was (1/2 m v0²), and the final kinetic is (1/2 m v²), where v is 6 ft/s.
5. The work done by the mate is the total energy change, which would be the sum of the final kinetic and potential energy minus the initial kinetic energy. Wait, wait, actually, the initial state is when the brick is at the lower position with velocity v0, and the final state is at the higher position (10 ft up) with velocity 6 ft/s.

Wait, no. Wait, the brick starts at the lower position (mate's height) with some initial velocity v0 upwards. It travels up 10 ft, reaching the bricklayer, at which point it has a velocity of 6 ft/s upwards.

So, using the conservation of energy, the initial kinetic energy plus the initial potential energy equals the final kinetic plus the final potential.

Let me set up the equations.

Let me set the mate's position as the reference point (y=0). Then the bricklayer is at y = 10 ft.

The brick starts at y=0 with velocity v0. It ends at y=10 ft with velocity v =6 ft/s.

So, using conservation of mechanical energy (assuming no air resistance, so only gravity doing work):

Initial kinetic energy (KE_initial) + initial potential energy (PE_initial) = final KE (KE_final) + final PE (PE_final).

PE_initial is m * g * 0 = 0.

PE_final is m * g * 10.

KE_initial is (1/2) m v0².

KE_final is (1/2) m (6)^2.

So:

(1/2) m v0² + 0 = (1/2) m (36) + m g (10)

We can cancel m from all terms.

(1/2) v0² = 18 + 10 g

Wait, but what's g in ft/s²? I think in imperial units, g is approximately 32 ft/s². So,

(1/2) v0² = 18 + 10 *32

10*32 is 320, so 18 + 320 = 338.

Then,

v0² = 2 * 338 = 676.

So v0 = sqrt(676) = 26 ft/s. Hmm, that's a pretty high initial velocity, but okay.

So the initial kinetic energy was (1/2 m v0²) = (1/2 m * 676).

The final kinetic energy is (1/2 m * 36) = 18 m.

The potential energy gained is m g 10 = m *32 *10= 320 m.

Now, the energy expended by the mate is the work he does on the brick, which would be the change in the brick's mechanical energy. Wait, no. The work done by the mate is equal to the initial kinetic energy plus the change in potential energy. Wait, no, the mate is providing the initial kinetic energy and doing work against gravity to lift the brick.

Wait, maybe another approach: the work done by the mate is the initial kinetic energy, because he imparts that to the brick. Then, as the brick rises, the gravitational potential energy increases, and the kinetic energy decreases. But perhaps the mate's work is the initial KE plus the change in potential energy. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, the work done by the mate is the total energy the brick has initially, which is the initial KE. Then, as the brick moves upward, it converts some of that KE into PE, but since it ends up with some KE, the total energy is the sum of the final KE and PE.

Wait, wait, the initial energy provided by the mate is the initial KE. Then, the brick's total mechanical energy is that initial KE, which equals the sum of the final KE and the PE gained.

So:

Initial KE = Final KE + PE gained.

Which matches the equation earlier.

So, the initial KE is (1/2 m v0²) = 338 m as before.

The final KE is 18 m, and the PE gained is 320 m.

So, the total energy used by the mate is 338 m (the initial KE), right? Because that's the energy he imparts to the brick.

Out of this, the useful energy is the PE gained, which is 320 m, because that's what actually gets the brick up to the bricklayer. The remaining energy (18 m) is the final KE, which the brick has when it reaches the top. So that energy is 'wasted' because the brick is moving and that energy isn't being used for anything productive—it's just the kinetic energy the brick has when it arrives. So the percentage wasted is (18 / 338) * 100%.

Wait, let me calculate that.

18 divided by 338 is equal to approximately 0.05326, or 5.326%. So the percentage of energy that serves no useful purpose is about 5.3%.

Looking at the options, option B is 5.3%. So the answer should be B.

But wait, let me double-check. What exactly is the energy used by the mate? Because the mate imparts the initial kinetic energy, but the brick also gains potential energy as it rises. So the work done by the mate is the initial kinetic energy, which is (1/2 m v0²) = 338 m. The useful work is lifting the brick to 10 ft, which is 320 m. The kinetic energy at the top is 18 m, which is the 'wasted' part.

So the percentage wasted is (18 / 338) *100% ≈5.3%, which is option B.
</think>

To determine the percentage of energy used by the mate that serves no useful purpose, we analyze the energy expenditure in the scenario. The mate imparts an initial kinetic energy to the brick, which is then converted into a combination of final kinetic energy and potential energy as the brick reaches the bricklayer.

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   Using conservation of mechanical energy, the initial kinetic energy imparted by the mate equals the sum of the final kinetic energy and the potential energy gained:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} m v_0^2 = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 + m g h
   \]  
   where \(v_0\) is the initial velocity, \(v = 6 \, \text{ft/s}\) is the final velocity, \(g = 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \(h = 10 \, \text{ft}\) is the height difference.

2. **Solve for Initial Velocity (\(v_0\))**:  
   Substituting the known values:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} v_0^2 = \frac{1}{2} (6)^2 + 32 \cdot 10
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} v_0^2 = 18 + 320 = 338
   \]  
   \[
   v_0^2 = 676 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_0 = \sqrt{676} = 26 \, \text{ft/s}
   \]

3. **Energy Calculations**:  
   - Initial kinetic energy:  
     \[
     KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} m v_0^2 = \frac{1}{2} m (26)^2 = 338m
     \]  
   - Final kinetic energy:  
     \[
     KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \frac{1}{2} m (6)^2 = 18m
     \]  
   - Potential energy gained:  
     \[
     PE_{\text{gained}} = m g h = m (32)(10) = 320m
     \]

4. **Useful vs. Wasted Energy**:  
   - The useful energy is the potential energy gained (\(320m\)), which is used to lift the brick to the bricklayer's height.  
   - The wasted energy is the final kinetic energy (\(18m\)), as it does not contribute to the brick's height and is dissipated when the brick is caught.

5. **Percentage of Wasted Energy**:  
   The percentage of energy that serves no useful purpose is:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage Wasted} = \frac{KE_{\text{final}}}{KE_{\text{initial}}} \times 100 = \frac{18}{338} \times 100 \approx 5.3\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of energy used by the mate that serves no useful purpose is approximately **5.3%**, corresponding to option **B**.
