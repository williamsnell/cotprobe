Okay, so I've got this question here about which leader is known for spreading the dharma of non-violence. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these historical figures, but let me think this through.

First, I need to understand what "dharma of non-violence" means. Dharma usually refers to a principle or duty, often in a religious or philosophical context. Non-violence, or ahimsa, is a key concept in several Eastern religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. So the question is probably pointing towards someone who promoted this principle.

Looking at the options:

A: Ashoka. I remember Ashoka was an Indian emperor, right? He ruled a large part of India after a big war, maybe the Kalinga war. I think he converted to Buddhism after that war because he was so moved by the destruction. He then became a promoter of non-violence and spread Buddhism throughout his empire. So Ashoka fits the non-violence part.

B: Nelson Mandela. He was a South African leader who fought against apartheid. He's known for his role in ending segregation and promoting reconciliation, but I'm not sure if he's specifically linked to the dharma of non-violence in a religious sense. More about political non-violent resistance maybe.

C: Martin Luther King Jr. Definitely a leader in non-violent civil rights movement, inspired by Gandhi. He used non-violent methods to fight for civil rights in the US. But again, I'm not sure if it's tied to the term 'dharma' here.

D: Ngo Dinh Diem. I think he was the president of South Vietnam. From what I recall, his rule wasn't exactly peaceful. There was a lot of conflict during his time, including the start of the Vietnam War, so probably not him.

E: Adolf Hitler. No way, he's the opposite of non-violence. He's responsible for the Holocaust and WWII, so definitely not.

F: Vladimir Putin. He's the current Russian leader. His policies and actions don't align with non-violence, especially with the conflicts in Ukraine and elsewhere.

G: Mother Teresa. She was a humanitarian and nun who helped the poor, but her work was more about charity and compassion rather than spreading a non-violence movement in a political or religious leadership sense.

H: Siddhartha. Oh, Siddhartha Gautama is the Buddha himself, the founder of Buddhism. He taught non-violence as a core principle, but the question is about a leader who spread it, not the founder. Plus, the question specifies a leader, and Siddhartha is more of a spiritual teacher.

So, looking back, Ashoka (A) was a leader who converted to Buddhism and actively spread its teachings, including non-violence, across his empire. That makes sense. Mandela and MLK Jr. were more in the civil rights sphere but not tied to the term 'dharma' as much. So the answer should be A: Ashoka.

The leader known for spreading the dharma of non-violence is Ashoka. After converting to Buddhism following the Kalinga war, Ashoka became a prominent advocate for non-violence and propagated Buddhist teachings throughout his empire. This aligns with the concept of dharma, emphasizing duty and ethical principles.

Answer: A
