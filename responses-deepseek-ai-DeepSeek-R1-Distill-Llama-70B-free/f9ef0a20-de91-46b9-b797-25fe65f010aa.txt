Question:

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the recognition of foreign judgments and whether they follow the same rules as treaties when it comes to incorporation and transformation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that treaties and foreign judgments have different processes in international law. Treaties are agreements between states, and their incorporation into domestic law can depend on whether a country follows monism or dualism. Monism means that international law is automatically part of domestic law, while dualism requires an act of transformation, like legislation, to make a treaty applicable domestically.

Now, foreign judgments are different. They're decisions made by courts in another country. I think the recognition of these judgments isn't about the same incorporation or transformation process as treaties. Treaties are more about the state agreeing to be bound by certain rules, while foreign judgments are about whether a court in one country will recognize and enforce a judgment from another.

I remember something about the "rule of reciprocity" being a factor here. So, if Country A recognizes judgments from Country B, then Country B might do the same for A. But does that mean it's discretionary? Or is there another basis?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Monism. Monism is about treaties being part of domestic law automatically. I don't think this applies to judgments.

Option B: Dualism. Dualism would require some act to bring the foreign judgment into domestic law. But I don't think that's how it works. Judgments are more about recognition than incorporation.

Option C: Incorporation doctrine. That seems more about treaties again, like how they become part of the law without needing legislation.

Option D: Depends on bilateral or multilateral treaties. This makes sense because countries often have agreements (treaties) that outline when they'll recognize each other's judgments. Like the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements, for example.

Option E: Discretion based on reciprocity. So courts might decide based on whether the other country recognizes theirs. This sounds plausible, but I think it's often combined with treaties. So maybe it's not the only factor.

Option F: Automatic recognition without process. I don't think that's the case. There are usually some conditions or procedures.

Option G: Transformation doctrine. Again, transformation is about turning international law into domestic law through legislation, which is more about treaties.

So putting it together, the recognition of foreign judgments isn't about the same rules as treaties (like incorporation or transformation). Instead, it's more about whether there are treaties (bilateral or multilateral) in place that govern this recognition. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but what about the common law countries where recognition might be based on reciprocity without a treaty? Like in some jurisdictions, they might recognize foreign judgments if there's reciprocity, even without a treaty. So then option E could be a factor. But I think generally, it's more secure with treaties. The question is whether the rules are the same as treaties' incorporation/transformation. Since treaties' rules involve incorporation or transformation (monism/dualism), and foreign judgments don't use these doctrines, the answer would be that the recognition is dependent on treaties, making D correct.

Alternatively, if the question is whether the process is the same as for treaties (like needing to be incorporated or transformed), then the answer would be no, and it's based on other rules, such as treaties between nations or reciprocity.

I think the key is that the incorporation/transformation applies to treaties, while foreign judgments are recognized through separate mechanisms, often via treaties or reciprocity. So the correct answer is D, because the recognition is dependent on treaties, but not following the same incorporation rules as treaties themselves.

The recognition of foreign judgments operates under different principles than the incorporation and transformation of treaties. Treaties are incorporated into domestic law through doctrines such as monism (automatic incorporation) or dualism (requiring an act of transformation), whereas foreign judgments are typically recognized based on bilateral or multilateral treaties that outline the conditions for recognition and enforcement. While reciprocity may play a role in some jurisdictions, the primary mechanism for recognizing foreign judgments is the existence of such treaties. Therefore, the recognition of foreign judgments is not subject to the same rules as the incorporation and transformation of treaties.

D: The recognition of foreign judgments is dependent on the existence of appropriate bilateral or multilateral treaties.

Answer: D
