Okay, so I have this question about Sikhism and the ambrosial hours. Hmm, I remember that Sikh practices involve certain times for prayer and meditation. Ambrosial hours... I think that's a specific term in Sikh terminology. Let me try to recall.

I think the ambrosial hours are the early morning times when Sikhs are supposed to meditate and recite prayers. The word "ambrosial" makes me think of something sweet and divine, like a special time. So probably very early in the morning.

Wait, I've heard about the "Amrit Vela". Oh right, that's the term. Amrit Vela translates to the ambrosial hours. And Amrit Vela is the early morning time, like before sunrise. So when is that exactly?

From what I remember, Amrit Vela starts about 2 hours before sunrise. But I'm not sure about the exact hours because sunrise varies by season. But in terms of a standard time, maybe it's considered as between 1 am to 5 am or something? Or perhaps the specific hours are 3-6 am.

Looking at the options, let me see. The options are:

A: 9–11 p.m. — That's evening, probably not.
B: 10–12 p.m. — Midday, doesn't fit.
C: 6–9 p.m. — Evening again.
D: 1–4 a.m. — That's early morning, possible.
E: 12–3 p.m. — Afternoon.
F: 3–6 p.m. — Late afternoon.
G: 6–9 a.m. — Morning, but maybe after sunrise.
H: 7–10 a.m. — Later morning.
I: 3–6 a.m. — Early morning, fits the Amrit Vela idea.
J: 5–7 a.m. — Also early but maybe a bit later.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. I thought Amrit Vela is the last three hours before sunrise. So if sunrise is around 6 am, Amrit Vela would be from 3 am to 6 am. That would be option I: 3–6 a.m.

Alternatively, sometimes it's considered as 1–4 a.m., but that might be earlier. I'm pretty sure the standard ambrosial hours are 3–6 am, so option I.

The ambrosial hours, known as "Amrit Vela" in Sikhism, are the early morning period considered ideal for meditation and prayer. This time is typically observed as the last three hours before sunrise, which corresponds to 3–6 a.m. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

I: 3–6 a.m.

Answer: I
