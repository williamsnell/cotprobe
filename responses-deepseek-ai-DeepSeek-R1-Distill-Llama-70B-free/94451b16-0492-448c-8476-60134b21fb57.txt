Okay, so I've got this optics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a thin lens with a certain index of refraction and radii, and I need to find two factors: the Coddington shape factor (σ) and the position factor (π) for an object placed 1.2 meters away.

First, I remember that the Coddington shape factor, σ, is given by the formula σ = (R2 - R1) / (R1 + R2), but wait, wait. Wait, no, I think I might have that backwards. Let me think again. Oh right, the formula is σ = (R1 + R2)/(R1 - R2), but wait, no, that's not it either. Maybe I should look up the correct formula.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Oh wait, I think the Coddington shape factor is actually defined as σ = (R2 - R1)/(R1 - R2) or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's σ = (R1 + R2)/(R2 - R1). Hmm, this is getting a bit fuzzy.

Wait, I think it's σ = (R1 + R2)/(R1 - R2) multiplied by something. Or maybe σ is (R2 - R1)/(R2 + R1). Wait, perhaps I should think about the formula correctly.

Oh right, I think the Coddington shape factor is σ = (R1 + R2)/(R1 - R2). But wait, let me double-check. Another thought: I've heard that for a lens, σ is (R1 + R2)/(R1 - R2). But I'm not 100% confident. Alternatively, maybe σ is (R2 - R1)/(R2 + R1), but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the lens maker's formula, which is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2). But that's for focal length. How does that relate to σ?

Alternatively, I recall that the Coddington shape factor σ is given by (R1 + R2)/(R1 - R2). Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think: if a lens is equiconvex, like both surfaces are convex, then R1 would be positive and R2 negative, assuming R2 is the other radius. Wait, in the problem, R1 is +15 cm and R2 is -30 cm. So R1 is positive, R2 is negative.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write down the formula. From what I remember, the shape factor σ is defined as (R2 - R1)/(R2 + R1), but let me confirm. Oh wait, no, maybe it's (R1 - R2)/(R1 + R2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach: let's compute both possibilities and see which one makes sense.

Given R1 = +15 cm and R2 = -30 cm. Let me plug into the formula. Let's say option 1: σ = (R1 + R2)/(R1 - R2) → (15 + (-30))/(15 - (-30)) → (-15)/(45) = -1/3. Option 2: σ = (R1 - R2)/(R1 + R2) → (15 - (-30))/(15 + (-30)) → (45)/(-15) = -3. That can't be right because the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think again. Another possibility: I think the correct formula for the Coddington shape factor is σ = (R2 - R1)/(R1 + R2). Let's compute that. R2 is -30, R1 is 15. So R2 - R1 is (-30 - 15) = -45. R1 + R2 is 15 + (-30) = -15. So σ = (-45)/(-15) = 3. Hmm, that's not matching any of the options either. So perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, maybe the formula is σ = (R1 - R2)/(R1 + R2). Let's try that. R1-R2 is 15 - (-30) = 45. R1 + R2 is -15. So 45 / (-15) = -3. Again, not matching the options. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is σ = (R1 + R2)/(R1 - R2). Let's try that. (15 + (-30))/(15 - (-30)) → (-15)/(45) = -1/3. This gives σ = -1/3. Looking at the options, option C is σ = -1/3, π = 0.167, and option E is σ = -1/3, π = -0.167.

So that would give us σ as -1/3. So that's part (a) done.

Now part (b) is the position factor π, which is given by π = (s - f)/(s + f), where s is the object distance. Wait, but wait, another approach: I think the position factor is defined as π = (f)/(f + s) or something similar. Alternatively, I remember that the position factor might relate to the object distance and the focal length. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the position factor π is given by π = (s - f)/(s + f). Or maybe it's (f)/(s). Hmm, I'm not certain. Alternatively, in the context of lens formulas, when dealing with magnification or something else, the position factor could involve the object distance and focal length.

Wait, I think the position factor is defined as π = (f)/(f + s), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (s - f)/(s + f). Let me think of an example. Suppose the object is at the focal point, so s = f. Then, (s - f) is zero, so π would be zero. That might make sense, but I'm not certain.

Wait, alternatively, the position factor π is defined as (s - f)/(s + f). So when s approaches infinity, π approaches (s)/(s) → 1. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, I might be confusing it with the magnification formulas. Alternatively, perhaps the position factor is defined as π = (f)/(s), but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the lens formula: 1/f = 1/s + 1/s', where s' is the image distance. But I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the position factor is given by π = (s - f)/(s + f). Let's try that.

Given that the object distance s is 1.2 meters, which is 120 cm. Wait, but we need to compute the focal length f first.

To compute f, we can use the lens maker's formula: 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2). So n is 1.60. R1 is +15 cm, R2 is -30 cm.

So 1/f = (1.60 - 1) * (1/15 - (1/(-30))) → (0.60) * (1/15 + 1/30) → 0.6 * (2/30 + 1/30) → 0.6 * (3/30) → 0.6 * (1/10) → 0.06 → 1/f = 0.06 cm^{-1}, so f = 1/0.06 = approx 16.666... cm, which is 16.666... cm. So 1/f = 0.06 → f ≈ 16.6667 cm, which is 1/6 cm^{-1} → Wait, wait: 0.06 is 6/100, so 1/0.06 is 100/6 ≈ 16.6667 cm.

So f ≈ 16.6667 cm, which is 0.166667 meters.

Now, the object distance s is given as 1.2 meters, which is 120 cm, which is larger than f, so the object is outside the focal length.

Now, position factor π is (s - f)/(s + f). Let's compute that. s = 120 cm, f ≈ 16.6667 cm.

s - f = 120 - 16.6667 ≈ 103.3333 cm.

s + f = 120 + 16.6667 ≈ 136.6667 cm.

So π ≈ 103.3333 / 136.6667 ≈ 0.7556, but wait, that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, if π is (f)/(s + f), then f/(s + f) is 16.6667/(136.6667) ≈ 0.1222, which is approximately 0.122, which is close to 0.125, which is 1/8. But none of the options have 0.125.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C has π = 0.167, which is 1/6, approximately. Option E has π = -0.167.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for π. Maybe π is (s - f)/(s + f). Let's compute that.

s is 120 cm, f is 16.6667 cm.

s - f = 103.3333 cm.

s + f = 136.6667 cm.

103.3333 / 136.6667 ≈ 0.7556, which is about 0.756, which is roughly 3/4. But none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating f. Let me recalculate f.

Using the lens formula again:

1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ]

Given R1 is +15 cm, R2 is -30 cm.

So 1/R1 = 1/15 cm⁻¹, 1/R2 = 1/(-30) cm⁻¹.

So (1/R1) - (1/R2) = (1/15) - ( -1/30 ) = 1/15 + 1/30 = 2/30 + 1/30 = 3/30 = 1/10 cm⁻¹.

Multiply by (n-1) = 0.6 → 0.6 * (1/10) = 0.06 cm⁻¹.

So 1/f = 0.06 → f = 1/0.06 ≈ 16.6667 cm, which is correct.

So the mistake isn't there.

Wait, perhaps the position factor is defined differently. Maybe π is (f)/(s - f). Let's try that.

So f = 16.6667 cm, s = 120 cm.

f/(s - f) = 16.6667/(120 - 16.6667) = 16.6667/103.3333 ≈ 0.1613, which is about 0.1613, which is approximately 0.167 (1/6). Hmm, that's close to 0.167.

Looking at the options, option C has π = 0.167, and option E has π = -0.167.

So if π is (f)/(s - f), then it's positive 0.1613, which rounds to 0.167. So that would correspond to option C, where σ is -1/3 and π is 0.167.

Wait, but why would the position factor be f/(s - f)? I thought maybe it's (f)/(s + f) or (s - f)/(s + f), but perhaps I should verify the correct formula.

Alternatively, the position factor might be defined as π = (f)/(s + f). Let me compute that.

f/(s + f) = 16.6667/(120 + 16.6667) = 16.6667/136.6667 ≈ 0.1222, which is about 0.122, which is 1/8.25, but none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the position factor is π = (f)/(s). Let's see: 16.6667/120 ≈ 0.1389, which is about 0.139, which is not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again about the position factor. I recall that in some contexts, the position factor relates to the ratio of the image distance to the object distance, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the position factor π is given by (s - f)/(s + f). But in that case, as we computed earlier, it's around 0.756, which isn't any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps π is given by (f)/(s - f). Let's compute that:

f = 16.6667 cm, s = 120 cm.

f/(s - f) = 16.6667/(120 - 16.6667) = 16.6667/103.3333 ≈ 0.1613, which is about 0.1613. So approximately 0.167, which is option C.

But in the options, option C has π = 0.167 and σ = -1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the position factor is defined as π = (f)/(s + f), which as we saw is about 0.122, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the formula for position factor is different. Let me think: maybe π is (s - f)/(2f), but that would give (120 - 16.6667)/(2*16.6667) ≈ 103.3333 / 33.3333 ≈ 3.1, which is too big.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (s)/(f) - 1. Let's see: s = 120 cm, f = 16.6667 cm. s/f = 120/16.6667 ≈ 7.2. So 7.2 - 1 = 6.2, which is way off.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the definition of position factor. Alternatively, maybe it's defined as (f)/(s - f) as I thought earlier, which gives ~0.1613, which is close to 0.167, so option C's π is 0.167, which would be correct.

So part a) σ is -1/3, and part b) π is approximately 0.167, so option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for σ. Let me check that again.

σ is the Coddington shape factor, and I think it's defined as (R2 - R1)/(R1 + R2). Wait, earlier I thought that gave me 3, but perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, R1 is 15 cm, R2 is -30 cm.

R2 - R1 = (-30) - 15 = -45 cm.

R1 + R2 = 15 + (-30) = -15 cm.

So σ = (R2 - R1)/(R1 + R2) → (-45)/(-15) → 3. So σ = 3. But that's not any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the correct formula is σ = (R1 - R2)/(R1 + R2). So R1-R2 is 15 - (-30) = 45. R1 + R2 is -15.

So σ = 45 / (-15) = -3. Again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is σ = (R1 + R2)/(R1 - R2). So R1 + R2 is -15, R1 - R2 is 45. So σ = (-15)/45 = -1/3.

Ah, that matches. So σ is -1/3. So part a) is correct with that. So part (a) is σ = -1/3.

So then, part (b), as per earlier calculation, if π is f/(s - f) → 16.6667/(120 - 16.6667) ≈ 0.1613, which is approximately 0.167. So π ≈ 0.167, matching option C, which has σ = -1/3 and π = 0.167.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the sign conventions. For the lens maker's formula, the signs are based on the direction the lens is facing. R1 is positive if it's convex towards the incoming light, and R2 is negative if it's concave on the other side. Wait, in this problem, R1 is +15 and R2 is -30. So that makes the lens a converging lens because (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2) is positive, which we saw gives a positive f.

Wait, but when calculating the position factor, the sign might matter. Wait, in the formula I used earlier, if s is the object distance, it's positive when it's real (on the same side as the incoming light). So in our case, s is positive, and f is positive because it's a converging lens.

Wait, but perhaps the position factor is (s - f)/(s + f), which would be (120 - 16.6667)/(120 + 16.6667) → 103.3333/136.6667 ≈ 0.756, which isn't any of the options. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the position factor is defined as (f)/(s), which is 16.6667/120 ≈ 0.1389, which is about 0.139. None of the options have that.

Wait, maybe the position factor is (f)/(s - f), which is 16.6667/(120 - 16.6667) ≈ 0.1613, which is approximately 0.167. So that would match option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the position factor with something else. Maybe it's better to look up the exact definition.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the position factor. Let me recall: the position factor π is defined as the ratio of the image distance (s') to the object distance (s). But wait, that's the transverse magnification. No, that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the position factor is defined as π = (f)/(f + s), which in this case would be 16.6667/(16.6667 +
