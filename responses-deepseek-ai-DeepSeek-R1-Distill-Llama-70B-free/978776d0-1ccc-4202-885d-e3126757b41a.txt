Okay, so I've got this question here about Mr. Hammer's finances and I need to find his propensity to save. Hmm, I remember that propensity to save has something to do with savings rate, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Alright, let's break it down. The question says Mr. Hammer's disposable income last year was $5,000. Disposable income is the money left after paying taxes and other mandatory deductions, right? So that's the total amount he had available to spend or save.

His total expenditures were $4,600. Expenditures would be all the money he spent. So if he had $5,000 and spent $4,600, how much did he save? I think savings would be income minus expenditures. So 5,000 minus 4,600 equals... let's see, 400. Yeah, he saved $400.

Now, the question is about the propensity to save. I'm pretty sure that's the ratio of savings to disposable income. So the formula should be savings divided by disposable income, then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

So plugging in the numbers: 400 divided by 5,000. Let me do that calculation. 400 รท 5000 equals... 0.08. Multiply by 100 gives 8%. So his propensity to save is 8%.

Looking at the options, I see F is 8%. So the answer should be F.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Some people confuse it with the average propensity to consume, which is expenditures over income. But here it's savings over income, which is the same as 1 minus APC. So yes, 400/5000 is 8%, so F is correct.

To determine Mr. Hammer's propensity to save, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Propensity to Save} = \left( \frac{\text{Savings}}{\text{Disposable Income}} \right) \times 100
\]

1. **Disposable Income**: $5,000  
2. **Total Expenditures**: $4,600  
3. **Savings**: Disposable Income - Total Expenditures = $5,000 - $4,600 = $400  

Plugging the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Propensity to Save} = \left( \frac{400}{5,000} \right) \times 100 = 8\%
\]

Thus, Mr. Hammer's propensity to save is 8%.

The correct answer is:

**F: 8%**

F
