Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about group performance on a certain type of task. It says that the group's performance is limited by the least skilled or knowledgeable member. Hmm. I remember from my psychology class that group tasks can be categorized based on how the group's overall performance is determined. 

I think there are different types like additive, conjunctive, disjunctive, etc. Let me try to remember what each of these terms means. 

Additive tasks are when the group's total output is the sum of each member's contributions. Like if each person can do a part, and the more they do, the better the total. For example, if you're collecting donations and each person brings in some amount, the total is additive.

Conjunctive tasks, on the other hand, are when the group's success depends on every member's performance. So if even one person doesn't do well, the whole group's performance suffers. Like if you're working on a project where each person has a critical part, and if one fails, the whole project fails. Or maybe a team sport where everyone needs to perform well together.

Disjunctive tasks are the opposite, I think. The group's success depends on at least one member doing well. So if even one person does a great job, the whole group does well. Like in a brainstorming session where only one good idea is needed.

Then there's additive versus conjunctive. So the question is about when the group's performance is limited by the weakest member. That sounds like a conjunctive task because the group can't perform better than the weakest link. 

Wait, let me think again. If it's a conjunctive task, the group's overall performance is as strong as the weakest member. So in a task where everyone has to work together, and all must perform well, the group's performance can't exceed the lowest performer. 

So the blank should be filled with 'conjunctive'. Looking at the options, option B is conjunctive. So the correct answer should be B.

The correct answer is B: conjunctive.
