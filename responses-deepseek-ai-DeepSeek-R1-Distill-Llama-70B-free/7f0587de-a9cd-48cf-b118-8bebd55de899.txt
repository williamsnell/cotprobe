Okay, so I've got this probability problem about the lifetimes of two components in a device. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

Alright, the setup is that we have two independent random variables, X₁ and X₂. Each represents the lifetime of a component, and both have an exponential distribution with a mean of 1000 hours. The device fails only when both components fail. Then they define Y₁ as the minimum of X₁ and X₂, and Y₂ as the maximum. So Y₁ is the time when the first component fails, and Y₂ is when the second one fails. The joint distribution of Y₁ and Y₂ is defined for 0 < y₁ < y₂ < infinity.

The question is part (a), and it's asking for G(y₁, y₂), which is the probability that Y₁ is less than or equal to y₁ and Y₂ is less than or equal to y₂. So G(y₁, y₂) = P(Y₁ ≤ y₁, Y₂ ≤ y₂).

Hmm, okay, I remember that when dealing with order statistics like the minimum and maximum of two variables, there's a way to find their joint distribution. Since X₁ and X₂ are independent, their joint PDF is the product of their individual PDFs.

Each X_i has an exponential distribution. The PDF of an exponential distribution with mean θ is λe^(-λx) for x ≥ 0, where λ is 1/θ. Since the mean is 1000, λ should be 1/1000. So the PDF for each X is (1/1000) e^(-x/1000).

Now, for the order statistics Y₁ and Y₂. The joint PDF of Y₁ and Y₂ can be found, but here we're asked for the joint CDF G(y₁, y₂) = P(Y₁ ≤ y₁, Y₂ ≤ y₂).

Wait, but Y₂ is the maximum, so if both Y₁ and Y₂ are less than or equal to y₁ and y₂ respectively, that implies that both X₁ and X₂ are less than or equal to y₂, because Y₂ is the maximum. But since Y₁ is the smaller one, it's less than Y₂, so y₁ must be less than y₂.

So G(y₁, y₂) is the probability that both X₁ and X₂ are ≤ y₂, but with the condition that the minimum is ≤ y₁. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, since Y₁ ≤ y₁ and Y₂ ≤ y₂, this is equivalent to both X₁ ≤ y₂ and X₂ ≤ y₂ (because the maximum can't exceed y₂), and also that the minimum of X₁ and X₂ is ≤ y₁. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait another approach: Y₁ is the minimum, Y₂ is the maximum. So the event {Y₁ ≤ y₁, Y₂ ≤ y₂} is the same as the event that both X₁ ≤ y₂ and X₂ ≤ y₂ (since Y₂ is the max), and at least one of them is ≤ y₁.

Wait, that might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to express G(y₁, y₂) in terms of the individual probabilities.

Wait, I think the correct way is to note that for G(y₁, y₂) = P(Y₁ ≤ y₁, Y₂ ≤ y₂), which is the same as P(Y₁ ≤ y₁, Y₂ ≤ y₂). But since Y₁ is the minimum and Y₂ is the maximum, this is equivalent to P(X₁ ≤ y₂, X₂ ≤ y₂, and min(X₁,X₂) ≤ y₁). But since if both X's are ≤ y₂, then the minimum is automatically ≤ y₂, which is larger than y₁ because y₁ < y₂. So maybe that's redundant.

Wait no, because y₁ is less than y₂, so the condition that min(X₁,X₂) ≤ y₁ is automatically satisfied if both X₁ and X₂ are ≤ y₂. Because if both are ≤ y₂, then the minimum is ≤ y₂, which is certainly ≥ y₁? No, wait, no. Because y₁ is less than y₂. So if the minimum is ≤ y₂, but we want it to be ≤ y₁. So G(y₁, y₂) is the probability that both X₁ and X₂ are ≤ y₂, and the minimum of X₁ and X₂ is ≤ y₁.

Wait, but if both X₁ and X₂ are ≤ y₂, then the minimum is automatically ≤ y₂. But we need the minimum to be ≤ y₁, where y₁ < y₂. So this would mean that at least one of X₁ or X₂ is ≤ y₁, and both are ≤ y₂.

So G(y₁, y₂) is the probability that both X₁ and X₂ are ≤ y₂, and at least one of them is ≤ y₁.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute G(y₁, y₂) using the joint distribution of Y₁ and Y₂.

Wait, I think I remember that the joint CDF of the order statistics for two independent variables can be expressed as:

G(y₁, y₂) = P(Y₁ ≤ y₁, Y₂ ≤ y₂) = [F_X(y₂)]² - [F_X(y₁) - F_X(y₂)]²?

No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps another approach. The joint PDF for Y₁ and Y₂ when they are order statistics of two independent exponentials.

Wait, but maybe I should find the joint CDF. The joint CDF G(y₁, y₂) is the probability that Y₁ ≤ y₁ and Y₂ ≤ y₂. Y₁ is the minimum, Y₂ is the maximum.

So that means both X₁ and X₂ are ≤ y₂, and the smaller one is ≤ y₁. But since y₁ < y₂, the minimum being ≤ y₁ automatically satisfies that it's ≤ y₂. So the condition Y₁ ≤ y₁ and Y₂ ≤ y₂ is equivalent to both X₁ ≤ y₂ and X₂ ≤ y₂, and min(X₁, X₂) ≤ y₁.

So G(y₁, y₂) = P(X₁ ≤ y₂, X₂ ≤ y₂, min(X₁,X₂) ≤ y₁).

But since both variables are ≤ y₂, the min is automatically ≤ y₂, which is larger than y₁, so we need the min to be ≤ y₁, which is a stricter condition.

So how do I compute that?

Alternatively, think about the event {Y₁ ≤ y₁, Y₂ ≤ y₂} as the union of two cases: either X₁ ≤ y₁ and X₂ ≤ y₂, or X₂ ≤ y₁ and X₁ ≤ y₂. But wait, since y₁ < y₂, if X₁ is ≤ y₁, then X₂ can be up to y₂. Similarly for X₂ ≤ y₁.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute this as G(y₁, y₂) = P(Y₁ ≤ y₁ and Y₂ ≤ y₂) = P(min(X₁, X₂) ≤ y₁ and max(X₁, X₂) ≤ y₂).

Since min ≤ y₁ and max ≤ y₂, and since y₁ < y₂, this is equivalent to both X₁ and X₂ being ≤ y₂, and at least one of them being ≤ y₁.

Because if both are ≤ y₂, but neither is ≤ y₁, then the min would be > y₁, which would violate the condition. So the condition is that both are ≤ y₂ AND at least one is ≤ y₁.

So G(y₁, y₂) = P(X₁ ≤ y₂, X₂ ≤ y₂, and (X₁ ≤ y₁ or X₂ ≤ y₁)).

But since X₁ and X₂ are independent, maybe I can compute this as:

G(y₁, y₂) = P(X₁ ≤ y₂ and X₂ ≤ y₂) - P(X₁ > y₁ and X₂ > y₁ and X₁ ≤ y₂ and X₂ ≤ y₂).

Wait, because P(A and B) = P(B) - P(not A and B). So A is (X₁ ≤ y₁ or X₂ ≤ y₁), B is (X₁ ≤ y₂ and X₂ ≤ y₂).

So G(y₁, y₂) = P(X₁ ≤ y₂ and X₂ ≤ y₂) - P(X₁ > y₁ and X₂ > y₁ and X₁ ≤ y₂ and X₂ ≤ y₂).

Simplify the second term: X₁ > y₁ and X₁ ≤ y₂ is equivalent to y₁ < X₁ ≤ y₂. Similarly for X₂. So the second term becomes P(y₁ < X₁ ≤ y₂ and y₁ < X₂ ≤ y₂).

Which is [P(y₁ < X₁ ≤ y₂)]² because X₁ and X₂ are independent.

Since each X_i is exponential, P(y₁ < X_i ≤ y₂) = F_X(y₂) - F_X(y₁), where F_X is the CDF of X_i.

The CDF of X_i is 1 - e^(-λ x), where λ = 1/1000.

So F_X(y) = 1 - e^(-y/1000).

Thus, P(y₁ < X_i ≤ y₂) = [1 - e^(-y₂/1000)] - [1 - e^(-y₁/1000)] = e^(-y₁/1000) - e^(-y₂/1000).

So the second term is [e^(-y₁/1000) - e^(-y₂/1000)]².

So putting it all together:

G(y₁, y₂) = [F_X(y₂)]² - [e^(-y₁/1000) - e^(-y₂/1000)]².

Wait, because the first term is P(X₁ ≤ y₂ and X₂ ≤ y₂) = [F_X(y₂)]².

So,

G(y₁, y₂) = [F_X(y₂)]^2 - [e^{-y₁/1000} - e^{-y₂/1000}]^2.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, F_X(y₂) = 1 - e^{-y₂/1000}, so [F_X(y₂)]^2 = (1 - e^{-y₂/1000})^2.

Then, the second term is [e^{-y₁/1000} - e^{-y₂/1000}]^2.

So,

G(y₁, y₂) = (1 - e^{-y₂/1000})² - (e^{-y₁/1000} - e^{-y₂/1000})².

Let me expand both squares.

First term: (1 - a)^2 where a = e^{-y₂/1000}.

= 1 - 2a + a².

Second term: (b - a)^2 where b = e^{-y₁/1000}.

= b² - 2ab + a².

So subtracting second term from first:

[1 - 2a + a²] - [b² - 2ab + a²] = 1 - 2a + a² - b² + 2ab - a².

Simplify:

1 - 2a - b² + 2ab.

Wait, let's compute:

1 - 2a + a² - b² + 2ab - a².

The a² cancels with -a².

So 1 -2a -b² + 2ab.

Factor terms:

1 - 2a + 2ab - b².

Hmm, maybe I can factor this differently.

Wait, let's think about it again. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way.

Wait, another approach: since the variables are exponential and independent, maybe the joint distribution of Y₁ and Y₂ has a known form.

The joint PDF for order statistics of two exponentials can be derived, but since the question is about the CDF, perhaps using the method I started earlier is the way to go.

But let me think again. Another way to compute G(y₁, y₂) is to realize that for Y₁ ≤ y₁ and Y₂ ≤ y₂, both X₁ and X₂ must be ≤ y₂, and at least one of them is ≤ y₁.

So G(y₁, y₂) = P(X₁ ≤ y₂ and X₂ ≤ y₂) - P(X₁ > y₁ and X₂ > y₁ and X₁ ≤ y₂ and X₂ ≤ y₂).

Which simplifies to [F_X(y₂)]^2 - [F_X(y₂) - F_X(y₁)]^2, because P(X > y₁ and X ≤ y₂) = F_X(y₂) - F_X(y₁).

Wait, that makes sense. Because the event X₁ > y₁ and X₁ ≤ y₂ is F_X(y₂) - F_X(y₁), same for X₂. Since they're independent, the joint probability is [F_X(y₂) - F_X(y₁)]².

So G(y₁, y₂) = [F_X(y₂)]² - [F_X(y₂) - F_X(y₁)]².

Expanding this:

= F_X(y₂)^2 - (F_X(y₂)^2 - 2 F_X(y₂) F_X(y₁) + F_X(y₁)^2 )

= F_X(y₂)^2 - F_X(y₂)^2 + 2 F_X(y₂) F_X(y₁) - F_X(y₁)^2

= 2 F_X(y₂) F_X(y₁) - F_X(y₁)^2.

Factor out F_X(y₁):

= F_X(y₁) [ 2 F_X(y₂) - F_X(y₁) ].

Wait, but F_X(y₁) is 1 - e^{-y₁/1000}, and F_X(y₂) is 1 - e^{-y₂/1000}.

So plugging in:

G(y₁, y₂) = [1 - e^{-y₁/1000}] * [ 2(1 - e^{-y₂/1000}) - (1 - e^{-y₁/1000}) ]

Simplify the expression inside the brackets:

= [1 - e^{-y₁/1000}] * [ 2 - 2 e^{-y₂/1000} - 1 + e^{-y₁/1000} ]

= [1 - e^{-y₁/1000}] * [1 + e^{-y₁/1000} - 2 e^{-y₂/1000} ]

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the expression G(y₁, y₂) = 2 F_X(y₁) F_X(y₂) - [F_X(y₁)]².

Wait, no, from earlier, it's 2 F_X(y₁) F_X(y₂) - [F_X(y₁)]². Wait no, earlier step said G(y₁,y₂)=2 F_X(y₂) F_X(y₁) - F_X(y₁)^2.

Wait, let me double-check:

We had G(y₁, y₂) = [F_X(y₂)]² - [F_X(y₂) - F_X(y₁)]².

Which expands to F_X(y₂)^2 - (F_X(y₂)^2 - 2 F_X(y₂) F_X(y₁) + F_X(y₁)^2 )

So that's F_X(y₂)^2 - F_X(y₂)^2 + 2 F_X(y₂) F_X(y₁) - F_X(y₁)^2.

Which simplifies to 2 F_X(y₂) F_X(y₁) - F_X(y₁)^2.

So yes, G(y₁, y₂) = 2 F_X(y₁) F_X(y₂) - [F_X(y₁)]^2.

Factoring F_X(y₁):

= F_X(y₁) [ 2 F_X(y₂) - F_X(y₁) ].

Hmm, but perhaps it's easier to compute using the expression I derived earlier:

G(y₁, y₂) = 2 F_X(y₁) F_X(y₂) - [F_X(y₁)]^2.

Now, substituting F_X(y) = 1 - e^{-y/1000}.

So,

G(y₁, y₂) = 2 [1 - e^{-y₁/1000}] [1 - e^{-y₂/1000}] - [1 - e^{-y₁/1000}]^2.

Let me compute this:

Expand the first term:

2 [ (1)(1) - 1 e^{-y₂/1000} - 1 e^{-y₁/1000} + e^{-y₁/1000} e^{-y₂/1000} ]

= 2 [1 - e^{-y₂/1000} - e^{-y₁/1000} + e^{-(y₁+y₂)/1000} ]

Then subtract the second term, which is [1 - 2 e^{-y₁/1000} + e^{-2 y₁/1000} ].

So,

G = 2[1 - e^{-y₂} - e^{-y₁} + e^{-(y₁+y₂)} ] - [1 - 2 e^{-y₁} + e^{-2 y₁} ]

Let me drop the 1000 denominator for simplicity, remembering that it's all divided by 1000.

Expanding:

= 2*1 - 2 e^{-y₂} - 2 e^{-y₁} + 2 e^{-(y₁+y₂)} -1 + 2 e^{-y₁} - e^{-2 y₁}.

Simplify term by term:

2 - 2 e^{-y₂} - 2 e^{-y₁} + 2 e^{-(y₁+y₂)} - 1 + 2 e^{-y₁} - e^{-2 y₁}.

Combine like terms:

2 - 1 = 1.

-2 e^{-y₂} remains.

-2 e^{-y₁} + 2 e^{-y₁} cancels out.

+2 e^{-(y₁+y₂)} remains.

- e^{-2 y₁} remains.

So,

G(y₁, y₂) = 1 - 2 e^{-y₂} + 2 e^{-(y₁ + y₂)} - e^{-2 y₁}.

Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me check if this makes sense.

Wait, when y₁ approaches 0, what happens?

As y₁ → 0, e^{-0} =1, so:

G = 1 - 2 e^{-y₂} + 2 e^{-y₂} - e^{0} = 1 -2 e^{-y₂} + 2 e^{-y₂} -1= 0. Which makes sense because Y₁
