Okay, so I have this question about ions having a rare gas electronic configuration. Hmm, I remember that rare gases, like noble gases, have a full outer shell, so their electron configuration is very stable. So when ions have that configuration, they're more stable.

The question gives me five ions: Ca²+, In⁺, Ga³+, Sc³+, and Se²-. I need to figure out which of these have a noble gas configuration.

Wait, let me think about each ion one by one. I should probably start by writing their electron configurations. 

First, Ca²+. Calcium is in group 2, so it has an atomic number of 20. Its electron configuration is [Ar] 4s². When it loses two electrons to become Ca²+, it loses the 4s electrons, so the configuration becomes [Ar]. That's the same as argon, a noble gas. So Ca²+ definitely has a rare gas configuration.

Next, In⁺. Indium is in group 13. Its atomic number is 49. The electron configuration is [Kr] 4d¹⁰ 5s² 5p¹. When it loses one electron to become In⁺, it would lose the 5p electron. So the configuration becomes [Kr] 4d¹⁰ 5s². Wait, that's similar to krypton, which is a noble gas. So In⁺ should have a rare gas configuration too.

Now Ga³+. Gallium is in group 13 as well. Atomic number 31. Its electron configuration is [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s² 4p¹. Losing three electrons would mean losing the 4p and 4s electrons. So Ga³+ would have [Ar] 3d¹⁰. That's the same as argon, so Ga³+ also has a noble gas configuration.

Sc³+ is next. Scandium is in group 3. Atomic number 21. Electron configuration is [Ar] 3d¹ 4s². Losing three electrons would mean losing the 4s and 3d electrons. So Sc³+ would have [Ar]. That's noble gas configuration again.

Wait, wait. Wait, Sc is [Ar] 3d¹ 4s². Losing three electrons: first lose 4s² (two electrons), then one from 3d, making Sc³+ with [Ar]. So yes, Sc³+ has a noble gas config.

Se²-: Selenium is in group 16. Atomic number 34. Electron configuration is [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s² 4p⁴. When it gains two electrons, it becomes Se²-: [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s² 4p⁶. That's [Ar] 4p⁶, which is krypton's configuration. So Se²- also has a noble gas setup.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Calcium's Ca²+ is [Ar], correct. Indium In⁺ is [Kr], because indium's neutral is [Kr] 5s² 4d¹⁰ 5p¹, losing one gives [Kr] 5s² 4d¹0? Or wait, does the 5p electron go first? Hmm, maybe I should think about the filling order. For neutral In, it's [Kr] 4d¹0 5s² 5p¹. So when it loses one electron, it's losing the 5p¹, so the configuration becomes [Kr] 4d¹0 5s². That's the same as the krypton configuration, which is a noble gas.

Wait, but wait again. Krypton's configuration is [Kr], but indium is in the fifth period. When In⁺ loses an electron, does its configuration become [Kr] 4d¹0 5s²? Because 5s is lower in energy than 4d. Oh wait, actually, 4d is filled after 5s. So the configuration for In⁺ would be [Kr] 4d¹0 5s². But Krypton's configuration is [Kr], which is 36 electrons. Let me count:

In⁺ has atomic number 49 minus 1 charge, so 48 electrons. [Kr] is 36. 48-36=12 electrons left. So the 4d has 10, 5s² gives 2, so 12 total. So yes, [Kr] 4d¹0 5s² is correct. But wait, that's not a noble gas configuration, because the noble gas krypton is [Kr], but In⁺ has more electrons beyond that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is about having a rare gas configuration, which means the same as a noble gas. So if the ion's electrons equal a noble gas, then it's correct. So let me recount.

In⁺: neutral In is Z=49. So In⁺ is Z=49, but with a +1 charge, so 48 electrons.

Kr has 36 electrons. So In⁺ has 48 - 36 = 12 electrons beyond Kr. So the configuration is [Kr] 4d¹0 5s². But that's more than Kr, so it's not a noble gas configuration. Oh wait, no! Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the rare gas configuration would mean that the ion's electron count equals that of a noble gas. So let's think about it that way.

What noble gases are nearby? Krypton has 36 electrons, Xenon 54, Argon 18.

In⁺ has 48 electrons. None of the noble gases have that. So In⁺ doesn't have a noble gas configuration. Oh no, so maybe I was wrong earlier.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Maybe I got confused. So, the question is which ions have a configuration that's equal to a noble gas. So for Ca²+, as [Ar], which is 18 electrons. So Ca²+ has 20-2=18, which is correct.

In⁺ has 49-1=48. Which noble gas has 48 electrons? Let's see:

He: 2, Ne:8, Ar:18, Kr:36, Xe:54, Rn:86. So 48 isn't a noble gas. So In⁺ does not have a rare gas configuration. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong about In⁺ earlier.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the electron configuration. Let me think again. Indium is in period 5, group 13. So for In, the neutral configuration is [Kr] 4d^10 5s^2 5p^1. When it loses one electron, it becomes In^+ with [Kr] 4d^10 5s^2. So the electron count is 36 (Kr) + 10 (4d) + 2 (5s) = 48. So that's correct, but 48 isn't a noble gas. So In⁺ doesn't have a rare gas configuration. So I must have made a mistake earlier thinking it did.

Hmm, so maybe I need to reevaluate the ions.

Let's go through each ion again.

(a) Ca²+: Z=20, 20-2=18. [Ar], which is a noble gas. Yes.

(b) In⁺: Z=49, 49-1=48. 48 isn't a noble gas number. So no.

(c) Ga³+: Z=31, 31-3=28. So 28. What noble gas is that? Argon is 18, Krypton 36. 28 is between them. So Ga³+ is [Ar] 3d^10, because 18 + 10 = 28. So [Ar] 3d^10 is the configuration. So this is also a noble gas configuration? Because [Ar] 3d^10 is similar to Krypton only if it's [Kr], but wait, no. [Ar] 3d^10 is not the same as any noble gas. Because Krypton is [Kr], which is 36 electrons. So Ga³+ is [Ar] 3d^10 (28 electrons), which isn't a noble gas. Wait, but wait. [Ar] 3d^10 4s^0 would be 18 + 10 = 28. But what is the configuration for a noble gas? They have completely filled p orbitals. So Ga³+ would have an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d^10, but that's not a noble gas. So Ga³+ doesn't have a rare gas configuration. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The noble gases have full outer shells. So for example, Argon has 8 electrons in its outer shell (n=3), Krypton has 8 in n=4.

Wait, Ga³+ has the configuration [Ar] 3d^10. So that means it has 3 shells: first shell (n=1) filled, second (n=2) filled, third (n=3) has d orbitals filled but the s and p are filled as in Argon. Wait, actually, the electron configuration for Ga³+ is [Ar] 3d^10. So the outermost shell is n=3, but the p orbitals are filled in [Ar], and the d are part of n=3 as well. So for Ga³+, the valence electrons are the 3d, but the p in n=3 is already filled in [Ar]. So the configuration is [Ar] 3d^10. So that doesn't correspond to any noble gas, because noble gases have p^6, and possibly no d electrons. So Ga³+ doesn't have a rare gas configuration.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each ion's electron count and compare to noble gases.

Ca²+: 20-2=18 → [Ar], yes.

In⁺: 49-1=48 → Not a noble gas count (nearest is Kr at 36, Xe at 54).

Ga³+: 31-3=28 → which is more than Ar (18) but less than Kr (36). 28 isn't a noble gas count.

Sc³+: Scandium has Z=21. 21-3=18 → 18, which is Ar. So Sc³+ has [Ar] configuration, which is a noble gas.

Se²-: Se has Z=34. 34 + 2 = 36 → [Kr], which is a noble gas. Because Se²- has 36 electrons. So yes, Se²- has a rare gas configuration.

Wait, so let me list which ions have rare gas configurations:

(a) Ca²+ → Yes (Ar).

(b) In⁺ → No.

(c) Ga³+ → No.

(d) Sc³+ → Yes (Ar).

(e) Se²- → Yes (Kr).

So the ions that have rare gas configurations are Ca²+, Sc³+, and Se²-.

Looking back at the options, let's see.

The options are A to J. Let me read the options again.

Option C: Ca²+, Sc³+, Se²-. Yes, that's the combination.

Option C is (Ca²+, Sc³+, Se²-).

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A: In⁺, Sc³+, Se²-

B: Ca²+, Ga³+, In³+

C: Ca²+, Sc³+, Se²-

D: In³+, Ga³+, Se²-

E: Ca²+, In⁺, Se²-

F: In⁺, Ga³+, Sc³+

G: Ga³+, In⁺, Ca²+

H: Ca²+, In³+, Ga³+

I: In³+, Ca²+, Sc³+

J: Sc³+, Se²-, Ga³+.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine which ions possess a rare gas electronic configuration, we analyze each ion's electron count and compare it to the electron counts of noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn). Noble gases have full outer shells, and ions with the same electron count as a noble gas are said to have a rare gas configuration.

### Analysis of Each Ion:
1. **Ca²+**:  
   - Calcium (Z = 20) loses 2 electrons to form Ca²+.  
   - Electron count = 20 - 2 = 18.  
   - This matches the electron count of argon (Ar), a noble gas.  
   - **Conclusion**: Ca²+ has a rare gas configuration.

2. **In⁺**:  
   - Indium (Z = 49) loses 1 electron to form In⁺.  
   - Electron count = 49 - 1 = 48.  
   - No noble gas has 48 electrons (nearest are Kr with 36 and Xe with 54).  
   - **Conclusion**: In⁺ does not have a rare gas configuration.

3. **Ga³+**:  
   - Gallium (Z = 31) loses 3 electrons to form Ga³+.  
   - Electron count = 31 - 3 = 28.  
   - This does not match the electron count of any noble gas (nearest are Ar with 18 and Kr with 36).  
   - **Conclusion**: Ga³+ does not have a rare gas configuration.

4. **Sc³+**:  
   - Scandium (Z = 21) loses 3 electrons to form Sc³+.  
   - Electron count = 21 - 3 = 18.  
   - This matches the electron count of argon (Ar), a noble gas.  
   - **Conclusion**: Sc³+ has a rare gas configuration.

5. **Se²-**:  
   - Selenium (Z = 34) gains 2 electrons to form Se²-.  
   - Electron count = 34 + 2 = 36.  
   - This matches the electron count of krypton (Kr), a noble gas.  
   - **Conclusion**: Se²- has a rare gas configuration.

### Final Answer:
The ions that possess a rare gas electronic configuration are **Ca²+, Sc³+, and Se²-**. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct choice is:

**C: Ca²+, Sc³+, and Se²-**
