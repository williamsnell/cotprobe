The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The question as to who, and what, is responsible for African underdevelopment can be answered at two levels. Firstly, the answer is that the operation of the imperialist system bears major responsibility for African economic retardation by draining African wealth and by making it impossible to develop more rapidly the resources of the continent. Secondly, one has to deal with those who manipulate the system and those who are either agents or unwitting accomplices of the said system. The capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa."
Walter Rodney, historian, How Europe Underdeveloped Africa, 1974

Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans from 1450 to 1750 C.E. The question references Walter Rodney's work, which I remember talks about how Europe underdeveloped Africa through exploitation.

Let me start by understanding the question. It's asking what best explains the importance of these trading contacts. So I need to look at each option and see which one fits the context.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with Europeans for firearms. I know that firearms were part of the trade, especially in some regions like West Africa. For example, the Ashanti and Dahomey kingdoms used firearms to expand their territories. So this seems plausible.

Option B: They relied on Europeans to circumvent the Arab slave trade. Wait, the Arab slave trade was mainly across the Sahara and the Indian Ocean, while Europeans were involved in the transatlantic slave trade. So maybe this isn't correct because the Europeans were part of the slave trade, not helping to circumvent it.

Option C: Europeans were the sole purchasers of slaves. No, that's not right. Europeans were major buyers, but the slave trade also involved internal African sales and other markets. So C isn't correct.

Option D: They gained an economic advantage by trading resources for European goods. While they did trade resources, I'm not sure if it was an advantage. Rodney's argument is that this trade was exploitative, draining African wealth. So maybe D is not the best choice.

Option E: Dependency on European goods led to local industries collapsing. This sounds like it could be true. If Africans relied too much on European imports, their own industries might have declined. But was this the primary importance of the trade contacts? I'm not sure.

Option F: They used trade to get European education and religion. I don't think this was the main point. Missionaries came later, maybe more in the 19th century. The primary trade was about goods, not education.

Option G: Europeans helped sustain population with New World foods. New World crops like maize and cassava did come to Africa, but did this happen during 1450-1750? I think the Columbian exchange started in the 1500s, so maybe. But was this the main importance? I'm not certain.

Option H: Allies with Europeans against Arab merchants. I don't recall this being a major factor. The competition was more between European powers themselves.

Option I: Spread their culture to Europe through trade. I don't think this was the case. The cultural exchange was more one-sided, with Europe influencing Africa, especially later on.

Option J: Acquired new agricultural techniques. Again, this might have happened, but was it the main reason for the importance of trade? Probably not the primary factor.

So, going back, the question is about the importance of the trade contacts. The options that seem most relevant are A, D, E, G.

Rodney's point is that the trade was exploitative, leading to underdevelopment. So the trade was important because it allowed access to certain goods that might have helped in the short term but were detrimental in the long run.

Option A says they used firearms to consolidate states. Firearms were indeed traded, and some African kingdoms used them to expand. So maybe this is a key point. But does it explain the overall importance? It's more of a specific use rather than the general importance.

Option D suggests economic advantage, but as Rodney argues, the trade was a net loss for Africa. So D might not be correct because it's more about resources being drained.

Option E talks about dependency leading to collapse of industries. This aligns with Rodney's argument that the system made African economies dependent and underdeveloped. So this could be a strong contender.

Option G's about population growth through food imports. I'm not sure how significant this was during that period. Maize and cassava did help, but perhaps that's more of a secondary effect.

So, considering all this, the best answer might be E: Sub-Saharan Africans developed a dependency on European goods, leading to a collapse of local industries. But wait, the question is about the importance of the trading contacts, not the negative impact. Or maybe it's about what the Africans gained.

Alternatively, Option A focuses on the consolidation of states through firearms, which was a direct result of the trade. So maybe A is better because it's a specific positive outcome, while E is a negative consequence.

But the question is about the importance, not whether it was good or bad. So if the trade allowed them to get firearms which helped consolidate states, that's an important reason.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question asks which option best explains the importance of the trading contacts. So it's about why the trade was important for the Africans. If they used the trade to get firearms to build their states, then A is correct. But if the trade was important because it led to dependency and underdevelopment, then E would be the answer.

Looking back at Rodney's quote, he says that the imperialist system drained African wealth and prevented rapid development. So the trading contacts were part of that system. Therefore, the importance might be tied to how it integrated Africa into a system that exploited them, leading to underdevelopment.

But the question is phrased as "the importance of trading contacts... for Sub-Saharan Africans." So it's from their perspective, what was the importance.

So perhaps the trade was important because it allowed them to acquire goods they needed, like firearms, which helped in state-building. But over time, it led to negative consequences.

In the options, A says they consolidated states by trading for firearms. That seems to be a key point. So maybe A is the best answer.

Alternatively, if the trade was important because it provided economic advantage, but that's not accurate because Rodney argues it was exploitative.

Hmm. I'm a bit torn between A and E.

Wait, the question is about the period 1450-1750. During this time, the transatlantic slave trade was a major part of the trade contacts. But the options don't all focus on that.

Option A is about firearms and state consolidation. I think that's correct because many African kingdoms did trade for firearms to strengthen their military, which helped in expanding their territories.

So I think the answer is A.

The question asks about the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans between 1450 and 1750 C.E. To determine the best answer, each option must be evaluated in the context of historical events and Walter Rodney's argument that European trade contributed to African underdevelopment.

- **Option A**: Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with Europeans for firearms. This is plausible, as firearms were used by some African kingdoms, like the Ashanti and Dahomey, to expand their territories. This represents a specific, positive outcome of the trade.
  
- **Option B**: Sub-Saharan Africans relied on Europeans to circumvent the Arab slave trade. This is incorrect because Europeans were active participants in the transatlantic slave trade, not helpers in circumventing it.

- **Option C**: Europeans were the sole purchasers of slaves. This is false, as the slave trade involved multiple markets, including internal African and Arab networks.

- **Option D**: Sub-Saharan Africans gained an economic advantage by trading resources for European goods. This aligns less with Rodney's argument, as he emphasizes exploitation rather than economic advantage.

- **Option E**: Dependency on European goods led to the collapse of local industries. This aligns with Rodney's critique of underdevelopment but focuses on a negative consequence rather than the importance of the trade itself.

- **Option F**: Trade provided access to European education and religion. This is incorrect, as education and religion were not primary aspects of the trade during this period.

- **Option G**: Europeans sustained population growth through New World foodstuffs. While New World crops like maize and cassava were introduced, this was a secondary effect and not the primary importance of the trade.

- **Option H**: Africans allied with Europeans against Arab merchants. This is not a major factor, as competition was mainly between European powers.

- **Option I**: Trade spread African cultural influence to Europe. This is incorrect, as cultural exchange was largely one-sided.

- **Option J**: Trade provided new agricultural techniques. This is not the primary reason for the importance of the trade.

The question focuses on the importance of the trade from the African perspective. While Rodney's work highlights exploitation, the trade's importance during this period can also be understood through specific benefits, such as the acquisition of firearms to consolidate states. Therefore, **Option A** is the best answer, as it directly addresses a key outcome of the trade contacts.

Answer: A
