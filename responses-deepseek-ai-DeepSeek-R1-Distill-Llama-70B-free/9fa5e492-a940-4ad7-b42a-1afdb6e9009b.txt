Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me about reaction rates and zero-order reactions. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think step by step.

Wait, what's a zero-order reaction again? I remember that reaction rates depend on the concentration of the reactants, right? And the order of the reaction tells us how the rate depends on each reactant's concentration.

Zero order... oh right! For a zero-order reaction, the rate is independent of the concentration of the reactant. Oh wait, wait. So the rate doesn't depend on how much A is present. So the rate equation can't have [A] in it.

But wait, the general rate law is rate = k [A]^m, where m is the order. So if the reaction is zero order, m is zero. So [A]^0 is 1, because anything to the zero power is 1. So the rate becomes k * 1, which is just k. 

So looking at the options, which one is just k? Let me check.

Option A: r = k [B] → No, that's first order in B, but the reaction is A→B, so probably the rate depends on [A], not [B]. Unless it's a reverse reaction, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option B: r = k [A]^2 → Second order. Not zero.

Option C: r = k [A] → First order. No, we're looking for zero.

Option D: Square root of [A]. That's like half-order, so no.

Option E: [A] to the power of -1. That's negative first order. Not zero.

Option F: r = k → Yes, that's it. Because for zero order, the rate is just the rate constant.

Options G through J involve other orders or dependencies on [B] or other terms. So none of those fit.

Wait, but is there any other possibility? Like, could the rate expression involve [B]? Well, in a zero-order reaction, the rate is independent of [A], but what about [B]?

Wait, the reaction given is A → B. So it's a simple first-order reaction if it's first order, but for zero order, the rate doesn't depend on [A]. So would it ever depend on [B]? Probably not, because the rate is about the disappearance of A, which is the reactant. Products usually don't affect the rate in elementary reactions, unless it's a reversible reaction, but that's not indicated here.

So yeah, the correct answer should be option F: r = k.

In a zero-order reaction, the rate is independent of the concentration of the reactant. For the reaction \( A \to B \), the rate law is expressed as \( r = k \), where \( k \) is the rate constant. This is because the rate does not depend on \( [A] \) or \( [B] \) in any way.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: \( r = k [B] \)** → Incorrect. This implies first-order dependence on \( [B] \), which is not relevant for a zero-order reaction.
- **B: \( r = k [A]^2 \)** → Incorrect. This represents a second-order reaction, not zero-order.
- **C: \( r = k [A] \)** → Incorrect. This is a first-order reaction.
- **D: \( r = k \sqrt{[A]} \)** → Incorrect. This represents a half-order reaction.
- **E: \( r = k [A]^{-1} \)** → Incorrect. This represents a negative first-order reaction.
- **F: \( r = k \)** → Correct. This matches the definition of a zero-order reaction, where the rate is independent of reactant concentration.
- **G: \( r = k [B]^2 \)** → Incorrect. This implies second-order dependence on \( [B] \), which is unrelated to zero-order kinetics.
- **H: \( r = k [A]^3 \)** → Incorrect. This represents a third-order reaction.
- **I: \( r = k / [A] \)** → Incorrect. This represents a reaction with a negative first-order dependence on \( [A] \).
- **J: \( r = k \ln[A] \)** → Incorrect. This is not a standard form for zero-order kinetics.

The correct answer is **F: \( r = k \)**. 

Answer: F
