Question:

A heavyset man with long red hair robbed a liquor store. Thereafter, a man was arrested and charged with the armed robbery. At the man's trial, the owner of the liquor store was called to testify. He admitted that he was unable to identify the man, who now had a shaven head, as the robber. The prosecuting attorney then handed the owner six photographs. He proposed to testify, over defense objections, that he had previously told the prosecuting attorney that picture #4, admittedly a picture of the man before he shaved his head, was a picture of the person who robbed his store. The owner's proffered testimony should be adjudged

Options:

A: admissible as a prior identification by the witness.
B: inadmissible, due to the potential for bias or suggestion.
C: admissible as past recollection recorded.
D: admissible, as it is the owner's personal account of the event.
E: inadmissible, because it is a violation of the man's right of confrontation.
F: admissible, because it is relevant to the case.
G: inadmissible, as it is based on a photograph and not a live lineup.
H: admissible, as it provides critical evidence for the case.
I: inadmissible, because the owner failed to identify the man in court.

Okay, so I have this evidence law question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The situation is about a robbery. A heavyset man with long red hair robbed a liquor store. Then, a man was arrested and charged. At the trial, the liquor store owner testified but couldn't identify the man because the man had a shaven head now. The prosecution then gave the owner six photos. The owner had previously told the prosecuting attorney that picture #4, which is a picture of the man before he shaved his head, was the robber. The prosecution wants the owner to testify about this, but the defense objects. The question is whether this testimony is admissible.

So the options are A through I, each giving a different reason why it's admissible or not.

First, I need to think about the rules of evidence, particularly regarding witness identification and prior statements.

I remember that when a witness cannot make an identification in court, the prosecution can sometimes use prior identifications. But there are rules about how that's done. I think prior identifications can be used if they were made under circumstances that indicate reliability. Like, if the witness identified a photo in a lineup before, that can be admissible even if the witness can't identify the person in court.

Wait, but in this case, the witness is testifying about a prior identification he made from photographs. So the prosecutor is asking the witness to recount that prior statement. So the issue is whether that's allowed.

I recall that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a prior statement by a witness can be used to rebut a charge of recent fabrication, but it's generally not allowed as substantive evidence unless certain conditions are met. Wait, but here, the witness is testifying about his own prior statement, which would be hearsay unless an exception applies.

Wait, but in this scenario, the witness is on the stand, and he's being asked about his prior identification. So the prosecution is offering his testimony about his prior statement as evidence that the defendant is guilty. But the problem is that the defendant is now in court with a different appearance, so the witness can't identify him now.

So the question is, is the witness's prior identification admissible now?

I think the rule is that prior identifications can be admissible if they were made under circumstances that show they were reliable. But here, the prior identification was made from photographs, not a lineup, so maybe that's a factor.

Wait, the prior identification from photo arrays is generally admissible if certain procedures were followed, but even if not, the court might allow it if it's reliable. But in this case, the witness is testifying about his prior identification, so that would be using the prior statement as substantive evidence.

But wait, the prior statement would be hearsay if offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Unless it falls under an exception. So is the witness's prior identification admissible under any hearsay exception?

I remember that prior identifications can be admissible under the rule that allows for statements of identification of a person made after perceiving him, which is an exception to hearsay. So under FRE 801(d)(1)(C), a statement of identification is not hearsay.

Wait, let me think. FRE 801(d)(1)(C) says that a statement is not hearsay if it's a statement of identification of a person made after perceiving him, and the statement is made by the declarant while believing the declarant was perceiving a drug, or (I think) in any event, if the declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination.

Wait, no, I think the rule is that a prior identification can be used as substantive evidence because it's a statement of identification under 801(d)(1)(C), which is an exclusion from hearsay.

So in this case, the witness (the owner) is testifying that he previously identified picture #4 as the robber. That would qualify under 801(d)(1)(C) because it's a statement of identification made by the witness after perceiving the person (the robber), and now the witness is testifying in court and can be cross-examined. So that statement would not be hearsay and would be admissible as substantive evidence.

But wait, in the scenario, the defense is objecting. So the question is whether this prior identification is admissible.

But another point is that when a witness cannot identify the defendant in court, the prior identification can still be admitted. So the fact that the owner can't identify the man now because he's shaven doesn't bar the prior identification from being admitted.

So looking at the options:

Option A says it's admissible as a prior identification by the witness. That seems to fit because the prior statement is a prior identification, and under 801(d)(1)(C), it's admissible.

Option B says inadmissible due to bias or suggestion. But I don't think that's the issue here. The prior identification is based on the witness's own perception, so unless there was something wrong with how the photos were presented, it should be okay.

Option C: past recollection recorded. That usually applies when a witness can't remember and refers to a document to refresh their memory. That's not the case here.

Option D: the owner's personal account. That doesn't directly address the hearsay issue.

Option E: confrontation clause violation. I don't think so, because the witness is testifying in court and can be cross-examined. The prior statement is being offered through the witness's own testimony, so no confrontation issue.

Option F: relevant. It is relevant, but that doesn't answer the hearsay objection.

Option G: based on a photo, not live lineup. I don't think that matters; photo identifications are allowed.

Option H: critical evidence. That's more about relevance, not admissibility.

Option I: inadmissible because owner couldn't identify in court. But as I thought earlier, prior identifications are allowed even if the current identification is lacking.

So the correct answer should be A.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a witness's prior identification of a defendant from a photograph, where the witness cannot identify the defendant in court due to a change in appearance. The prosecution seeks to admit the witness's prior statement identifying the defendant from a photo array, and the defense objects. The key issue is whether this prior identification is admissible under the rules of evidence.

Under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(1)(C), a statement of identification of a person made after perceiving them is not considered hearsay if the declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination. In this case, the witness (the liquor store owner) is testifying about his prior identification of the defendant from the photograph, and he is subject to cross-examination. Therefore, the prior identification qualifies as an exception to the hearsay rule and is admissible as substantive evidence.

Additionally, the fact that the witness cannot identify the defendant in court does not bar the admissibility of the prior identification. Prior identifications are generally admissible if they were made under reliable circumstances, even if the witness cannot make an in-court identification. The use of photographs, as opposed to a live lineup, does not render the identification inadmissible, as photo identifications are commonly allowed.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. The prior identification is admissible under FRE 801(d)(1)(C) as a prior identification by the witness.
- **B**: Incorrect. There is no indication of bias or suggestion affecting the reliability of the prior identification.
- **C**: Incorrect. This applies to past recollection recorded, which is not relevant here.
- **D**: Incorrect. While the testimony is the owner's personal account, this does not address the hearsay issue.
- **E**: Incorrect. The witness is testifying in court and subject to cross-examination, so there is no confrontation clause violation.
- **F**: Incorrect. While the evidence is relevant, this does not address the admissibility under hearsay rules.
- **G**: Incorrect. Photo identifications are admissible and do not require a live lineup.
- **H**: Incorrect. While the evidence may be critical, this does not address the legal standard for admissibility.
- **I**: Incorrect. The inability to identify the defendant in court does not bar the admissibility of the prior identification.

The correct answer is **A**.
