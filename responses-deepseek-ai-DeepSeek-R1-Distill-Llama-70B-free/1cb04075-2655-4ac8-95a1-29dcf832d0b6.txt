Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about phase differences in light reflected from thin films. Hmm, I remember that thin film interference has to do with the path difference and any phase changes that happen during reflection. Let me try to break this down.

The problem states: We have a magnesium fluoride (MgF2) coating of thickness 1000 Å on a lens. The refractive index of MgF2 is 1.38. We need to find the phase difference for violet light (4000 Å) and red light (7000 Å). Oh wait, but the options are in degrees, so I guess I need to calculate the phase difference in terms of wavelength first and then convert it to degrees.

Wait, phase difference is usually calculated as (2π/λ) multiplied by the path difference. But wait, the path difference comes from two things: the extra distance the light travels and any phase shifts upon reflection.

So for each reflection, when light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of π (180 degrees). If it reflects off a lower index, there's no phase shift. So in this case, let's think about the two reflections: the first is air to MgF2, and the second is MgF2 to glass (I assume the lens is glass, which has a higher n than MgF2, since MgF2 is often used as an anti-reflective coating).

Wait, MgF2 has n=1.38. Glass typically has a higher refractive index, say around 1.5 or so. So when light goes from MgF2 to glass, it's going to a higher index medium. So the reflection at the MgF2-glass interface would cause a phase shift of π.

But wait, the first reflection is air (n≈1) to MgF2 (n=1.38). Since 1.38 is higher than 1, this reflection also causes a phase shift of π. So both reflections have a phase shift, right?

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The two reflected rays we're considering are:

1. Ray 1: reflects off the air-MgF2 interface.
2. Ray 2: goes through MgF2, reflects off MgF2-glass, then comes back out.

So for Ray 1: air (n=1) to MgF2 (n=1.38). Since it's going from lower to higher n, this reflection causes a phase shift of π.

For Ray 2: MgF2 (n=1.38) to glass (n=1.5, let's say). Again, going from lower to higher n, so this reflection also causes a phase shift of π. So both reflections have a phase shift of π each.

Wait, but when light goes through a medium and reflects, does the transmission affect the phase? No, I think the phase shifts are only due to reflection. So both rays undergo a phase shift of π upon reflection.

But wait, Ray 2 goes through the MgF2 twice: once into the MgF2 and once coming back out. So the path length is twice the thickness of the MgF2. But since the MgF2 has a refractive index higher than air, the effective path length is 2 * n * t, where t is the thickness. Oh wait, no, the path difference is 2nt because the light travels through the film twice (once down, once up), and each time the path is n times the thickness in terms of optical path length.

Wait, the physical thickness is t = 1000 Å. The optical path for one pass (down) is n*t, so the round trip is 2n t.

So the path difference between Ray 2 and Ray 1 is 2n t.

But wait, what about the phase difference due to the path? It would be (2π/λ) * 2n t. But we also need to account for any phase shifts due to reflection.

So each reflection (Ray 1 and Ray 2) has a phase shift of π. So the total phase shift from reflections is π (Ray 1) plus π (Ray 2), which is 2π. But 2π is equivalent to 0 in terms of phase difference because it's a full cycle. So the net phase shift from reflections is zero.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Ray 1 reflects once (air-MgF2), phase shift π. Ray 2 reflects once (MgF2-glass), phase shift π. So the total phase shift between Ray 2 and Ray 1 is π (Ray1) minus π (Ray2) — wait, no. Because both undergo the same phase shift. So the relative phase shift is zero. So the only contribution is from the path difference.

Wait, no. Because both undergo a phase shift of π. So the phase difference between the two rays due to reflection would be π - π = 0. So the only phase difference comes from the path difference.

Wait, but wait: in thin film interference, when both reflections cause a phase shift, then the net effect is that the phase difference from reflection is zero. So the only phase difference is due to the path difference.

So the phase difference (Δφ) is (2π/λ) * (2n t) )

Wait, but wait, the formula for phase difference in thin films when both reflections cause a phase shift of π (so net zero) is: Δφ = (2π/λ) * 2n t.

So that's the formula I should use.

Now, the thickness t is 1000 Å, which is 1000 Angstroms. But wait, the wavelength given is in Angstroms as well, so 4000 Å and 7000 Å. So we can compute 2n t / λ to get the number of wavelengths difference, multiply by 2π to get the phase in radians, then convert to degrees by multiplying with (180/π).

Wait, let's compute for part (a): violet light, λ = 4000 Å.

n = 1.38, t = 1000 Å.

So 2n t = 2 * 1.38 * 1000 = 2760 Å.

Now, the ratio is 2760 / 4000 = 0.69.

But wait, wait, no: 2nt is 2*1.38*1000 = 2760 Angstroms.

The wavelength λ is 4000 Angstroms. So the number of wavelengths is 2760 / 4000 = 0.69.

But wait, this is the path difference in terms of the wavelength. So the phase difference is 0.69 * 2π radians.

Wait, 0.69 * 2π = approximately 4.34 radians.

But wait, 4.34 radians is more than 2π (which is about 6.28). Wait, no, 0.69 * 2π is 0.69 * 6.28 ≈ 4.33 radians. To convert that into degrees, since 2π radians = 360 degrees, 4.33 radians * (180/π) = 4.33 * (57.2958) ≈ 248 degrees.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation.

n = 1.38, t = 1000 Å.

So 2nt = 2 * 1.38 * 1000 = 2760 Å.

λ = 4000 Å.

So 2nt/λ = 2760 / 4000 = 0.69.

Multiply by 2π to get phase: 0.69 * 2π ≈ 4.33 radians.

Convert to degrees: 4.33 * (180/π) ≈ 248 degrees.

That matches option E's first part, which is 256 and 144, no... Wait, option E is 256 and 144. Wait, my calculation gives 248 for part (a). Let me check the options:

Option B: 248 and 142.

Yes, option B is 248 and 142 degrees.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait, 2nt = 2 * 1.38 * 1000 = 2760.

2760 / 4000 = 0.69.

0.69 * 360 degrees = 248.4 degrees, which rounds to 248 degrees. That's part (a).

Now part (b): red light, λ=7000 Å.

So 2nt = 2760 Å as before.

2760 / 7000 = 0.3942857.

Multiply by 360 degrees: 0.3942857 * 360 ≈ 142 degrees.

So part (b) is approximately 142 degrees.

Looking at the options, option B is 248 and 142. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't forget any other phase shifts. For example, sometimes if the path difference results in a phase shift that is an odd multiple of π, but in this case, since both reflections cause a phase shift, the net phase shift from reflections is zero. So all the phase difference comes from the path difference, which is 2nt.

Yes, so the calculation should be correct.

To determine the phase difference between light reflected from the inner and outer surfaces of a magnesium fluoride (MgF₂) deposit, we analyze the situation as follows:

The MgF₂ layer has a refractive index \( n = 1.38 \) and a thickness \( t = 1000 \, \text{Å} \). The phase difference arises due to the optical path difference and any phase shifts upon reflection. 

### Key Points:
1. **Phase Shifts Due to Reflection**:
   - At the air-MgF₂ interface, light reflects from a lower to a higher refractive index (\( n_{\text{air}} = 1 \) to \( n_{\text{MgF₂}} = 1.38 \)), causing a phase shift of \( \pi \) (180°).
   - At the MgF₂-glass interface, light reflects from a lower to a higher refractive index (\( n_{\text{MgF₂}} = 1.38 \) to \( n_{\text{glass}} \approx 1.5 \)), causing another phase shift of \( \pi \) (180°).
   - Since both reflections cause a phase shift of \( \pi \), the net phase shift due to reflection is \( \pi - \pi = 0 \).

2. **Path Difference**:
   - The light traveling through the MgF₂ layer twice (down and back) experiences an optical path difference of \( 2nt \), where \( t = 1000 \, \text{Å} \) and \( n = 1.38 \).
   - The optical path difference is \( 2nt = 2 \cdot 1.38 \cdot 1000 = 2760 \, \text{Å} \).

3. **Phase Difference Calculation**:
   - The phase difference is given by:
     \[
     \Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \cdot 2nt
     \]
   - For violet light (\( \lambda = 4000 \, \text{Å} \)):
     \[
     \Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi}{4000} \cdot 2760 = 0.69 \cdot 2\pi \approx 4.33 \, \text{radians}
     \]
     Converting to degrees:
     \[
     \Delta \phi \approx 4.33 \cdot \frac{180}{\pi} \approx 248^\circ
     \]
   - For red light (\( \lambda = 7000 \, \text{Å} \)):
     \[
     \Delta \phi = \frac{2\pi}{7000} \cdot 2760 = 0.394 \cdot 2\pi \approx 2.48 \, \text{radians}
     \]
     Converting to degrees:
     \[
     \Delta \phi \approx 2.48 \cdot \frac{180}{\pi} \approx 142^\circ
     \]

### Final Answer:
The phase differences for violet and red light are approximately **248° and 142°**, respectively. This matches **Option B**.
