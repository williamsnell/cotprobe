Alright, I'm trying to figure out the correct answer to this multiple-choice question about psychosomatic disorders. Okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. It's asking what psychosomatic disorders are and the general means of treating them. The options are from A to J.

I remember that the term "psychosomatic" combines "psyche" (mind) and "soma" (body). So, it's related to how the mind affects the body. Psychosomatic disorders are conditions where psychological factors play a significant role in the development or worsening of physical symptoms. So, it's not just in the mind; there are real physical symptoms involved.

Looking at the options:

Option A says psychosomatic disorders are mental illnesses with no physical symptoms, treated only through counseling. That doesn't sound right because psychosomatic disorders do have physical symptoms. So A is incorrect.

Option B claims they're caused exclusively by environmental factors and treated with lifestyle changes. I'm not sure about "exclusively," but I know that environmental factors can contribute along with others, like psychological ones. Also, treatment isn't just lifestyle changes. So B is probably wrong.

Option C states they're purely physical illnesses. No, because psychosomatic involves psychological aspects too. So C is incorrect.

Option D says they're imaginary diseases. That's not correct either. The symptoms are real, even if influenced by the mind. So D is wrong.

Option E says they're diagnosed only through physical exams and treated with surgery. That can't be right because psychological factors are involved, so treatment would include psychological methods. E is wrong.

Option F says they're genetic and treated with gene therapy. I don't think that's the case. While some might have genetic components, treatment isn't just gene therapy. So F is incorrect.

Option G says it's when psychological problems contribute to organic pathology, and treatment is both medical and psychological. That sounds right. Psychosomatic disorders involve both mind and body aspects, so treatment would address both. So G looks correct.

Option H attributes it to spiritual imbalances and uses spiritual healing. I don't think that's the standard approach, though some might use it alongside. So H is probably not the best answer.

Option I claims they're cured only by medication. That's not true because psychological treatments like therapy are also used. So I is wrong.

Option J says symptoms are from nutritional deficiencies and treated with supplements. That's too narrow; psychosomatic is broader. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be G. It accurately describes psychosomatic disorders as involving psychological factors in physical illnesses and uses both medical and psychological treatments.

The correct answer is G. Psychosomatic disorders involve psychological factors contributing to physical illnesses, requiring both medical and psychological treatment.
