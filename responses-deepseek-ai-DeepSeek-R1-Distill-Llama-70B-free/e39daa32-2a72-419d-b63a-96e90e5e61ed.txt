Okay, so I've got this problem here about a machine's rating and need to find the input, output, and efficiency at full load. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The nameplate says 110 volts, 38.5 amperes, and 5 horsepower. I remember that in electrical engineering, these kinds of problems involve calculating power. So I think the first step is to figure out the input power, which should be the electrical power coming into the machine.

Input power is usually voltage multiplied by current, right? So that's P_input = V * I. Let's plug in the numbers: 110 volts * 38.5 amps. Let me do that math. 110 * 38.5. Hmm, 100*38.5 is 3850, and 10*38.5 is 385, so adding them gives 4235 watts. Okay, so the input is 4235 W.

Wait, but sometimes efficiency comes into play. Oh wait, no, the input is just the power supplied, regardless of efficiency. So that's straightforward.

Next, the output. The output is the mechanical power, I think, which is given in horsepower. So we need to convert horsepower to watts. I remember that 1 horsepower is about 746 watts. So 5 hp would be 5 * 746. Let me calculate that. 5 * 700 is 3500, and 5 * 46 is 230, so total is 3730 watts. So the output is 3730 W.

Wait a second, but the problem says the machine is at full load. So is the output the same as the horsepower rating? I think that's correct. So output is 3730 W.

Now, efficiency. Efficiency is the output divided by input, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. So η = (output / input) * 100.

Plugging in the numbers: (3730 / 4235) * 100. Let me compute that. 3730 divided by 4235. Hmm, let me approximate. 4235 is roughly 4200, 3730 is 3730. 3730/4200 is about 0.89, because 0.8*4200 is 3360, 0.09*4200 is 378, so 3360+378=3738, which is a bit higher than 3730. So maybe it's about 0.888 or something. Let's compute it more accurately.

4235 multiplied by 0.88 is 4235 * 0.8 = 3388, plus 4235 * 0.08= 338.8, so total 3726.8. Which is very close to 3730. So 0.88 is 88%, but wait 0.88 is 88%, but wait 0.88 is 88%, so 0.88*4235= approx 3726.8, which is close to 3730, so the efficiency is about 88%. Wait, but wait, let's compute it more exactly.

3730 / 4235. Let me compute that. 4235 goes into 3730 how many times. Let's see:

4235 * 0.88 = 3726.8. So 3730 is 3.2 more than that. So 3.2 /4235 is approximately 0.000755, so adding that to 0.88 gives 0.880755, so approximately 88.0755%. So about 88.08%.

Looking at the options, let's see which option matches.

Option C says input 4350, output 3730, efficiency 85.7%. Wait, no, because our input is 4235, not 4350. So that's not right.

Option B: input 4500, output 4000, efficiency 88.9%. Hmm, output is 4000, but we calculated 3730. So that's not matching.

Option A: input 4235, output 3600, efficiency 85%. No, our output is higher.

Option F: input 4230, output 3650, efficiency 86.3%. Hmm, our output is 3730, which is higher than 3650, and efficiency is around 88%. So not matching.

Option C: input 4350, output 3730, 85.7% efficiency. Wait, input is higher than our calculated 4235, so that can't be.

Option I: input 4385, output 3750, efficiency 85.5%. No, our output is 3730, which is less than 3750. So that's not matching.

Wait, let me look again. Wait, option C has input 4350, which is higher than our 4235. So that's not it. Let me check the other options.

Option B: input 4500, output 4000. 4500 is higher than our 4235, but 4000 is higher than 3730. So no.

Option C's output is correct, but input is wrong. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck. Did the machine's nameplate say 5hp? Yes. So output is 5*746 = 3730 W. So that's correct.

Input is 110 * 38.5 = 4235 W. So correct.

Efficiency: 3730 / 4235 = 0.88075, so 88.075%. Looking for an option that has input around 4235, output 3730, and efficiency approx 88%.

Looking at the options:

Option C's input is 4350, which is higher.

Option F's input is 4230, which is close to 4235, but output is 3650, which is lower than 3730, efficiency is 86.3%.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Option C: input 4350, output 3730, efficiency 85.7%. Wait, 3730/4350 is 3730 ÷ 4350. Let me compute that. 3730/4350 = 0.857, so 85.7% efficiency. But our calculated input is 4235, which is lower than 4350. So that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me recompute.

Input = V * I = 110 * 38.5.

Let me calculate 110 * 38.5.

38.5 * 100 is 3850.

38.5 * 10 is 385.

So 3850 + 385 = 4235. Correct.

Output: 5hp = 5 *746=3730 W. Correct.

Efficiency: 3730 /4235 = ?

Let me compute 3730 divided by 4235.

Let me do this more accurately.

4235 * 0.88 = 4235*(0.8 + 0.08) = 4235*0.8= 3388, 4235*0.08= 338.8, sum is 3388+338.8= 3726.8.

3730 is 3.2 more than 3726.8, so 3.2 /4235 = approximately 0.000755. So 0.88 + 0.000755= 0.880755, which is 88.0755% efficiency.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B, which has efficiency 88.9%, but its output is 4000, which is higher than 3730, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the output is 5hp. Wait, the nameplate says 5hp. So yes, output is 5hp=3730W.

Wait, maybe the options have a typo. Let me check all options again.

Option C: input 4350, output 3730, efficiency 85.7%. So 3730/4350= 0.857 → 85.7%. But input should be 4235, not 4350.

Option B: input 4500, output 4000, efficiency 4000/4500=0.8888 → 88.89% efficiency. So that's 88.9%, but output is 4000, which is 4000/746 ≈5.36 hp, but the nameplate says 5hp, so that can't be.

Option F: input 4230, output 3650, efficiency (3650/4230)*100 ≈ 86.3%. But our output is 3730, which is higher than 3650.

Option C's output matches, but input is higher.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again.

Wait, perhaps the machine's output is not the same as the horsepower rating because sometimes the power factor comes into play, but the problem doesn't mention anything about power factor, so I think it's just voltage and current, so apparent power is V*I, and output is 5hp.

Wait, but wait, in electrical systems, when you have a motor, the input power is V * I, which is the apparent power. The output is the mechanical power, which is the shaft power, and the efficiency is output over input. So that's correct.

So according to that, the input is 4235 W, output 3730 W, efficiency approx 88.075%.

Looking at the options, none seem to have exactly these numbers.

Wait, let me check option C again. Input is 4350, output 3730, efficiency 85.7%. Hmm, 3730/4350 is 0.857, which is 85.7%. But the input should be 4235, not 4350.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the input calculation. Let me double-check. 110 *38.5.

Wait, 38.5 * 100 is 3850, 38.5 * 10 is 385, so 3850 +385=4235. Correct.

So the correct input is 4235 W, output 3730 W, efficiency ~88.075%.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B, but its output is higher. Option F has an input close to 4235, but output is lower.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing an option. Let me read the options again.

Option C is input=4350, output=3730, efficiency=85.7%.

So, if the input were 4350, then efficiency would be 85.7%, but our calculation shows input at 4235, which is lower than 4350, so efficiency would be higher.

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match. So perhaps I need to reevaluate.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the output is 5hp. Let me think: sometimes, the nameplate gives the output in horsepower, which is the mechanical power output. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for input as V * I, which is correct, but perhaps the options have rounded numbers. Let me see.

Our input is 4235 W. Let me see which option's input is closest.

Option A:4235 → matches our input.

Option A's output is 3600. Wait, 3600 is 3600/746 ≈4.82 hp. But the nameplate says 5 hp, so that's lower than expected. So option A's output is 3600, which is less than 3730.

Option F's input is 4230, which is close to our 4235. Its output is 3650, which is less than 3730.

Wait, perhaps the correct option isn't present. But that can't be. Let me look again.

Option C's output is 3730, which matches, but input is 4350. So perhaps the question had a typo. Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the voltage is 110, current is 38.5, but maybe it's three-phase? Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify, so I think we can assume single-phase.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, in such problems, the machine's rating is given as horsepower, but the input is calculated differently. No, I think I did it right.

Wait, perhaps the options consider the input in volt-amperes, but that's the same as watts for this purpose.

Wait, perhaps I should check the efficiency calculation again.

3730 /4235 = ?

Let me do this division more accurately.

3730 ÷ 4235.

Well, 4235 × 0.88 = 3726.8 → as before.

So 3730 - 3726.8 = 3.2.

So 3.2 /4235 = approximately 0.000755.

So total is 0.880755, which is 88.0755% efficiency.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B: efficiency 88.9%, but output is 4000 W, which is higher than 3730.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but that would require input being 4350, which is higher than calculated.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the input. Let me recheck.

38.5 A × 110 V = 4235 W. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but the input is 4350, which is higher than 4235. Maybe I should see if 4350 is 4235 rounded up. 4235 is approximately 4235. So option C's input is 4350, which is 115 more than 4235. That's a significant difference.

Wait, perhaps the correct option isn't listed, but that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the output.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the output is calculated using power = sqrt(3) * V * I * cos(theta) * efficiency, but without knowing the power factor, I can't compute that. Hmm, but the problem doesn't mention power factor, so I think we should ignore it and assume it's 1, meaning pure resistive load, so input is V*I, and output is the mechanical power, which is 5 hp.

So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me look at option C again. Input is 4350, output 3730, efficiency 85.7%. Let's compute what the input would be if efficiency is 85.7% and output is 3730. So input would be 3730 / 0.857 ≈ 4353 W, which is close to 4350. So that's how option C is computed. But in reality, the input is 4235, not 4350. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that 5 hp is the output, and the input is V × I × efficiency. Wait, no, efficiency is output over input. So input = output / efficiency.

But if the output is 3730 W, and the efficiency is, say, 85%, then input would be 3730 / 0.85 ≈4388 W. But our calculated input is 4235, which is lower. So that would require a higher efficiency.

Hmm, perhaps the given options are considering different approaches. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the option where output is 3730 W, input is 4235, and efficiency is approx 88.08%. But looking at the options, none match exactly.

Wait, let me look again. Option C: output 3730, input 4350, efficiency 85.7%. So perhaps the intended answer is C, but with the input being 4350, but that's not matching with our calculation of 4235. So maybe the question has a mistake, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me think: maybe the input is not V × I, but considering horsepower as input? No, that doesn't make sense because horsepower is output.

Wait, perhaps the input is in horsepower? No, no, input is electrical, so it's in watts.

Wait, another thought: maybe the machine's rating is 5 hp output, but the input current is 38.5 A, so perhaps the input power is 110 V × 38.5 A = 4235 W, and output is 5 hp = 3730 W. So efficiency is 3730/4235 ≈88.08%.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B: efficiency 88.9%, but its output is 4000 W, which is higher than 3730. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, and option C is the intended one, but with input 4235. But option C has 4350. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely in a multiple-choice question.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again, maybe I missed one.

Looking back:

Option C: Input 4350, Output 3730, Efficiency 85.7%.

Option F: Input 4230, Output 3650, Efficiency 86.3%.

Option B: 4500, 4000, 88.9%.

Hmm, none match 4235 input and 3730 output with 88% efficiency.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but the input is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose option C as the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of efficiency. Let me recompute.

3730 /4235 = ?

Let me compute 3730 ÷4235.

4235 goes into 3730 zero times. Let's add a decimal.

37300 ÷4235.

4235 ×8 = 33880.

37300 -33880= 3420.

Bring down a zero: 34200.

4235×8=33880. 34200-33880=320.

Bring down zero: 3200.

4235 goes into 3200 0 times. Next digit is 0.

So 0.88... approximately 0.880.

So 88.0%.

Looking for 88% efficiency, but none of the options have exactly that.

Wait, option B has 88.9%, which is close, but output is 4000, which is higher than 3730.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option C, but the input is 4350, which would mean efficiency is 3730/4350= 85.7%.

But why would the input be 4350 when V×I is 4235? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the output calculation. Let me check 5 hp again.

5 hp =5 ×746=3730 W. Correct.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should go with the option that has output 3730, which is
