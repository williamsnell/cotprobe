Question:

A property owner who owner her property in fee simple leased a three-story house and the 21 -acre tract upon which it stood to a friend for a term of 10 years. By the terms of the lease, the friend expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the friend, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The friend and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the friend assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a cousin, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the cousin would pay the owner the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The owner never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the owner conveyed her property interest in the premises to a developer. During the cousin's tenancy, the State Highway Authority filed proceedings to condemn two acres of the tract for the purpose of highway construction. As a result, the cousin contacted the developer and informed him that he should be entitled to an apportioned reduction in the rental. After the developer refused to reduce the rent, the cousin brings an action to have his rent apportioned pro tanto. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the developer, although the cousin would be entitled to terminate the lease.
B: the developer, because the cousin would be held to the original leasehold contract.
C: the cousin, because the value of his leasehold interest was reduced pro tanto.
D: the cousin, because eminent domain operates as an apportionment of rent.

Okay, let's try to work through this question step by step. So, the scenario involves property law, specifically lease agreements and the rights of the parties involved when certain events happen, like assignments and eminent domain. Hmm, I remember that leases can be a bit tricky, especially when it comes to assignments and what happens when the property is sold or when part of the land is taken for public use.

Let me start by breaking down the facts. The property owner leased a three-story house on a 21-acre tract to a friend for 10 years. The lease included a covenant to pay $300 monthly and to pay taxes. Also, the friend agreed not to assign or sublease without permission. But the friend assigned the lease to his cousin anyway, without the owner's consent. The assignment said the cousin would pay the rent but didn't mention taxes. The owner didn't object to this assignment. Later, the owner sold the property to a developer. 

Now, the state is condemning two acres for a highway. The cousin wants a reduction in rent because part of the land is being taken. The developer refused, so the cousin is suing for an apportionment of the rent. The question is whether the court will rule in favor of the cousin or the developer.

I think the first issue here is about the assignment of the lease. The original lease prohibited assignment, but the friend went ahead and assigned it to the cousin. The owner didn't object. Wait, does that mean the assignment is valid? I remember that if a lease prohibits assignment, but the lessor (the owner) consents to an assignment, it's allowed. But here, the owner didn't object after the assignment happened. So maybe the assignment is valid because the owner didn't timely object. Or maybe the owner's silence could be considered consent? I'm not sure. But in any case, the cousin is now in possession, so the developer, as the new owner, would have to deal with the cousin as the tenant.

Next, the issue is about the condemnation. The state is taking two acres through eminent domain. The lease was for the entire 21-acre tract, so taking part of it affects the lease. Now, the cousin is asking for the rent to be reduced proportionally because part of the land is no longer available. I think this is about apportionment of rent when part of the leased premises is condemned.

I recall that when part of the leased property is taken by eminent domain, the rent can be apportioned. The doctrine is that the tenant is entitled to a reduction in rent proportionate to the value of the part taken. But does this apply automatically, or does it depend on the lease terms?

Looking back at the lease, the friend (original lessee) covenanted to pay rent and taxes. The assignment to the cousin didn't mention taxes, but the lease's terms would still apply, right? Because the cousin steps into the friend's shoes as the lessee. So the cousin is responsible for the rent and the taxes, but in the assignment, the cousin only agreed to pay the rent. Wait, does that matter? Maybe not, because the lease's original terms bind the assignee. So the cousin has to pay both rent and taxes, regardless of what the assignment says. But that might not be directly relevant to the apportionment issue.

The main point is the condemnation. The cousin is using the remaining 19 acres (since 2 were taken). The rent was for the entire 21 acres, so when part is taken, the rent should be reduced proportionally. The lease is for the whole property, so the tenant isn't obliged to pay for the part that's no longer available. Therefore, the rent should be apportioned.

But wait, in some jurisdictions, the apportionment is allowed only if the lease isn't terminated. So when part of the land is taken, does the lease terminate as to the part taken, and the rent is reduced? Or does the tenant have the option to terminate the lease if the taking is substantial? I think the lease continues as to the remainder, and the rent is apportioned. So the cousin is entitled to a reduction.

But looking at the options, let's go through them. Option C says the cousin is entitled because the value of his lease was reduced. Option D says because eminent domain operates as an apportionment.

Wait, I think the doctrine is that when a part is taken, the rent is apportioned, so the tenant pays only for the part remaining. So the cousin would be entitled to a reduction. So the judgment would be for the cousin, either option C or D.

But another thought: who is the landlord now? The original owner sold the property to the developer, so the developer is now the landlord. The lease would have transferred to the developer, so the developer is responsible for the obligations under the lease, including any apportionment.

Wait, but the original lease was between the owner and the friend. When the owner sold the property, the developer steps into the owner's shoes as the landlord. So the developer is now entitled to collect rent and must comply with the lease terms. So when part of the land is taken, the developer would have to reduce the rent.

So the cousin, as the current tenant, is entitled to an apportioned rent. So the developer must reduce the rent pro tanto. Therefore, the cousin's action should succeed.

Looking at the options, option C says the cousin is entitled because the lease's value was reduced. Option D says because eminent domain causes apportionment. I think the correct reasoning is that when part is taken, the lease is apportioned, so the rent is reduced accordingly. So option D might be the reasoning, but sometimes the courts say that the tenant is entitled to an apportionment because the lease is for the whole, and they can't be forced to pay for the part taken. So maybe option C is more about the value, but option D is about the legal effect of eminent domain.

Alternatively, the common law rule is that if the leased premises are partially taken by eminent domain, the tenant is entitled to a proportionate reduction in rent. So option D says that. So I think the answer is C or D.

Wait, but looking back, option C says because the value of the lease was reduced, and D says because eminent domain operates as apportionment. I think the correct legal principle is that the taking by eminent domain results in apportionment of the rent. So the answer would be D.

Alternatively, some sources say that the apportionment is based on the diminished value of the leasehold, which would support option C.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Let me think again. The lease is for the entire 21 acres. When 2 acres are taken, the lease is split: the tenant holds the remaining 19, and the lease is apportioned. So the rent is apportioned according to the value of the land taken. The apportionment is because the lease can't continue as to the taken part. So the rent is reduced proportionally. So the reason is that the eminent domain results in apportionment, which is option D.

Wait, but I also remember that in some cases, the apportionment is at the tenant's option. If the taking is so substantial that it defeats the purpose of the lease, the tenant might have the option to terminate. But in this case, it's only 2 out of 21 acres, so probably not enough to terminate, but the tenant can get a reduced rent.

Wait, the question is about apportionment, not termination. The options A and B are about the developer winning, but I think the cousin is entitled to apportionment. So the options left are C and D.

I think the correct answer is C: the cousin because the value of his lease was reduced. Or D because eminent domain causes apportionment. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another angle: the lease is for the entire property. When part is taken, the lease is severed, and the rent abates proportionally. So the rent is reduced without the tenant needing to terminate. So the cousin doesn't have to terminate but can pay reduced rent. So the reason is based on the taking, so option D.

Alternatively, option C's reasoning is about the value, which is more of a equitable approach. But the legal doctrine is that the taking by eminent domain automatically results in apportionment. So I think D is the correct answer.

The scenario involves a lease agreement for a 21-acre tract with a three-story house, where the original lessee assigned the lease to a cousin despite a prohibition against assignments. The owner did not object to the assignment, and the property was later sold to a developer. When two acres were condemned for highway construction, the cousin sought an apportioned reduction in rent. The key issues are the validity of the assignment, the effect of the condemnation, and the entitlement to rent apportionment.

1. **Assignment of the Lease**: The lease prohibited assignment, but the owner's failure to object after the assignment could be interpreted as consent, making the assignment valid. As a result, the cousin became the lessee and stepped into the original lessee's position, bound by the lease terms.

2. **Condemnation and Rent Apportionment**: When part of the leased premises is taken by eminent domain, the lease is severed, and the rent is apportioned proportionally. The tenant is entitled to a reduction in rent corresponding to the value of the taken portion. This principle is based on the doctrine that a tenant should not be required to pay rent for property no longer in their possession due to condemnation.

3. **Developer's Role**: After the property was sold to the developer, the developer became the landlord and was obligated to honor the lease terms, including the apportionment of rent due to the condemnation.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The cousin is entitled to rent apportionment and does not need to terminate the lease.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The cousin is not bound to the original lease terms in a way that would prevent apportionment.
   - **Option C**: Plausible. The value of the leasehold interest was reduced due to the condemnation, supporting the cousin's entitlement to apportionment.
   - **Option D**: Correct. Eminent domain operates to apportion the rent, as the lease is severed for the condemned portion, and the tenant is only responsible for the remaining portion.

The correct answer is based on the legal principle that eminent domain results in the apportionment of rent, as the lease is severed for the condemned portion. 

Answer: D
