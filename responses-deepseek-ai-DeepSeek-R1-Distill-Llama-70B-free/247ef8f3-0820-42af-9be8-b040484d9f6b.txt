Question:

What are the psychoanalytic and behavioral theoriesof dissociativedisorders?

Options:

A: Behavioral theory posits that dissociative disorders are caused by genetic predispositions, while psychoanalytic theory suggests they stem from early attachment issues.
B: Dissociative disorders are caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain
C: Behavioral theory suggests dissociative disorders arise from reinforcement of certain behaviors, and psychoanalytic theory sees them as a manifestation of ego defense mechanisms.
D: Dissociative reactions are a result of unresolved childhood trauma
E: Dissociative disorders, according to behavioral theory, are the result of observational learning, while psychoanalytic theory links them to the death drive (Thanatos).
F: Psychoanalytic theory suggests dissociative disorders are learned behaviors, while behavioral theory suggests they are a form of self-punishment.
G: Psychoanalytic theory considers dissociative disorders as a byproduct of cognitive dissonance, whereas behavioral theory sees them as a consequence of classical conditioning.
H: Psychoanalytic theory attributes dissociative disorders to the failure of the Oedipus complex, while behavioral theory attributes them to the extinction of conditioned responses.
I: Psychoanalytic theory views dissociative reactions as instances of massive repression of unacceptable urges, usually relating back to the infantile sexual wishes. Behavioral theory views dissociative reactions as an avoidance response used to escape stressful stimuli.
J: Dissociative reactions are a result of social and environmental factors

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about dissociative disorders from the perspectives of psychoanalytic and behavioral theories. Hmm, I remember that dissociative disorders involve a disconnection from thoughts, feelings, or experiences. But wait, the question is about the theories behind them, specifically psychoanalytic and behavioral.

First, I should recall what each theory generally says about psychological issues. Psychoanalytic theory, which was developed by Freud, often talks about the unconscious mind, repression, and defense mechanisms. So, for dissociative disorders, maybe they think it's related to repressing traumatic memories or using defense mechanisms to escape stress.

Behavioral theory, on the other hand, focuses on observable behaviors and how they're learned through environment and experiences. So, maybe they attribute dissociative disorders to learned behaviors, perhaps as a way to cope with stress or as a result of conditioning.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Behavioral caused by genetics, psychoanalytic by attachment issues. I don't think behavioral theory focuses much on genetics; that's more of a biological perspective.

Option B: Chemical imbalance. That's a biological theory, not psychoanalytic or behavioral.

Option C: Behavioral says reinforcement of behaviors, psychoanalytic as ego defense. That sounds plausible. Defense mechanisms like repression are part of psychoanalytic theory. Behavioral might say that certain behaviors (like dissociation) are reinforced, maybe as a coping strategy.

Option D: Unresolved childhood trauma. This sounds more like a general statement, possibly aligning with psychoanalytic ideas, but the question is about both theories.

Option E: Behavioral as observational learning, psychoanalytic as death drive. Observational learning is part of social learning theory, a subset of behavioral. Death drive is a Freudian concept, but I'm not sure if that's linked to dissociation.

Option F: Psychoanalytic says learned behaviors, behavioral as self-punishment. That doesn't seem right. Psychoanalytic isn't about learning behaviors in that way, and self-punishment might be more behavioral, but I'm not certain.

Option G: Cognitive dissonance and classical conditioning. Cognitive dissonance is from cognitive theory, not psychoanalytic. So this might not be correct.

Option H: Oedipus complex and extinction. Oedipus is Freudian, but extinction is behavioral. Not sure if either directly relates to dissociation.

Option I: Psychoanalytic as repression of urges, behavioral as avoidance. This sounds right. Psychoanalytic theory often uses repression as a defense, so dissociation could be massive repression. Behavioral theory might see it as avoiding stressful stimuli, which fits as an avoidance response.

Option J: Social/environmental factors. That's more of a sociocultural perspective, maybe, but not specifically the two theories in question.

So, the correct answer is probably I. It correctly attributes psychoanalytic theory to repression and behavioral to avoidance.

The correct answer is I. Psychoanalytic theory views dissociative reactions as instances of massive repression of unacceptable urges, while behavioral theory sees them as an avoidance response to escape stressful stimuli.
