Okay, so I've got this problem here about Abby driving to work and back each day. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says Abby drives 18 miles round trip each day. Round trip means going to work and coming back home, right? So that's the total distance she covers in a day.

Now, the question is about rounding her daily trip to the nearest 5 miles. Hmm, I remember rounding numbers to the nearest five. So 18 milesâ€”let me think. The nearest multiples of five are 15 and 20. Since 18 is closer to 20 than 15 (because 18-15=3 and 20-18=2), so 18 rounded to the nearest 5 is 20 miles. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, 18 divided by 5 is 3.6. So the nearest integer is 4, so 4 times 5 is 20. Yeah, that makes sense. So each day's trip is approximated as 20 miles.

But wait, let me double-check. If the number ends in 5 or above, you round up. So 18 ends with an 8 which is above 5, so yeah, up to 20. That's correct.

Now, the next part is calculating the total miles driven in 5 days. So if each day is approximately 20 miles, then 5 days would be 20 * 5. Let me calculate that. 20 times 5 is 100. So the best estimate is 100 miles.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. The question says the daily round trip is rounded to the nearest 5 miles. So each day's 18 miles becomes 20, and then 5 days times 20 is 100. So looking at the options, option J is 100 miles.

But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A through J. Option J is 100, yes. But wait, are there any other considerations here? For example, sometimes when you round, you might have to think about whether the rounding is done per day or overall. But the question says the daily round trip is rounded, so yes, each day is rounded, then multiplied by 5.

Alternatively, if we didn't round each day, 18 miles a day times 5 days is 90 miles. But since each day is rounded up to 20, it's 100. So the answer should be 100 miles, which is option J.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me read the question again to confirm. It says, "the best estimate of the total number of miles driven in 5 days." So yeah, rounding each day's trip to the nearest 5 miles, then adding them up.

Another way to think: 18 is 2 away from 20, so each day she's driving 2 miles more than the actual. So over 5 days, that's an extra 10 miles. So 90 (actual total) +10 =100.

So I'm confident the correct answer is J: 100 miles.
</think>

Abby drives 18 miles round trip each day. When rounded to the nearest 5 miles, 18 miles becomes 20 miles per day. Over 5 days, the total distance is calculated as:

\[
20 \, \text{miles/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 100 \, \text{miles}.
\]

Thus, the best estimate for the total miles driven in 5 days is **100 miles**.

Answer: J
