Okay, so I have this physics problem here about work done during an isothermal compression of a liquid. Hmm. Let me think about what I remember from thermodynamics. So, the process is quasi-static and isothermal, which I think means it's happening very slowly and the temperature is constant. 

The equation given is ln(V/V₀) = -A(p - p₀), where A, V₀, and p₀ are constants. I need to find the expression for the total work done during this compression. 

Wait, work done during a process in thermodynamics is generally calculated using the integral of pressure with respect to volume, right? So the formula is W = ∫ P dV from the initial volume to the final volume. But since this is an isothermal process, is there a specific way to handle it?

Wait, no, in isothermal processes for ideal gases, we use W = nRT ln(V2/V1), but this is a liquid, and the equation given is different. So I can't directly apply the ideal gas law here. I need to derive the work from the given equation.

The given equation is ln(V/V₀) = -A(p - p₀). I can rearrange this to solve for p in terms of V. So let's see, ln(V/V₀) = -A(p - p₀) → multiply both sides by -1: -ln(V/V₀) = A(p - p₀). Then, divide by A: (p - p₀) = - (1/A) ln(V/V₀). So p = p₀ - (1/A) ln(V/V₀).

Wait, but I need to express P as a function of V to plug into the work integral. So P(V) = p₀ - (1/A) ln(V/V₀). 

But wait, let me check the algebra again. Starting from ln(V/V₀) = -A (p - p₀). Let me solve for p:

Add A p₀ to both sides: ln(V/V₀) + A p₀ = -A p.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try solving for p correctly:

ln(V/V₀) = -A (p - p₀)

Divide both sides by -A: (ln(V/V₀))/(-A) = p - p₀.

So p = p₀ - (1/A) ln(V/V₀). Yes, that's correct.

So P as a function of V is p = p₀ - (1/A) ln(V/V₀). 

Now, the work done is W = ∫ P dV from V₁ to V₂. Wait, but wait—the problem says it's a compression, so the volume decreases, which would mean work is done on the system. Depending on the sign conventions, work done by the system is positive or negative. I think in the formula, if the system is compressed (work done on it), the work would be negative, but I'll have to be careful.

So substituting P into the integral:

W = ∫ (from V1 to V2) [p₀ - (1/A) ln(V/V₀)] dV.

I can split this integral into two parts:

W = p₀ ∫ dV from V1 to V2 - (1/A) ∫ ln(V/V₀) dV from V1 to V2.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: p₀ (V2 - V1).

Second integral: ∫ ln(V/V₀) dV. Let me make substitution u = V/V₀, so V = u V₀, dV = V₀ du. So the integral becomes ∫ ln(u) * V₀ du. The integral of ln(u) du is u ln u - u, so:

∫ ln(u) V₀ du = V₀ [u ln u - u ] + C.

Substitute back u = V/V₀:

V₀ [ (V/V₀) ln(V/V₀) - (V/V₀) ) ] + C.

So the integral from V1 to V2 is:

V₀ [ (V2/V₀) ln(V2/V₀) - (V2/V₀) ) - ( (V1/V₀) ln(V1/V₀) - (V1/V₀) ) ) ]

Simplify this:

V₀ [ ( (V2 ln(V2/V₀) ) / V₀ - V2/V₀ ) - ( (V1 ln(V1/V₀) ) / V₀ - V1/V₀ ) ) ]

Multiply through by V₀:

= V₀ [ ( (2 ln(2) -1 ) ) type terms, but let me be precise.

Wait, let's simplify step by step.

The first term is [ (V2/V₀) ln(V2/V₀) - (V2/V₀) ].

The second term is [ (V1/V₀) ln(V1/V₀) - (V1/V₀) ].

So subtracting them gives:

[(V2/V₀)(ln(V2/V₀) -1) - (V1/V₀)(ln(V1/V₀) -1) ) ].

Multiply this by V₀:

= [V2 (ln(V2/V₀) -1) - V1 (ln(V1/V₀) -1) ) ]

So the second integral is:

- (1/A ) * [ V2 ( ln(V2/V₀) -1 ) - V1 ( ln(V1/V₀) -1 ) ) ]

Putting it all together, the work W is:

p₀ (V2 - V1) - (1/A) [ V2 ( ln(V2/V₀) -1 ) - V1 ( ln(V1/V₀) -1 ) ]

But I'm not sure if this is leading me towards any of the options given. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are much simpler. So maybe there's a smarter substitution or using the equation of state more directly.

Wait, perhaps I should express the work in terms of pressure instead of volume. Because the equation relates V and p, maybe substituting p into the integral would be better.

Wait, another approach: since we have a relation between V and p, perhaps we can write the integral in terms of p.

The work done is W = ∫ P dV. But if I can express V as a function of p, then dV would be the derivative of V with respect to p times dp. So dV = (dV/dp) dp.

From the given equation ln(V/V₀) = -A (p - p₀), we can write V = V₀ exp( -A (p - p₀) )

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(V) = ln(V₀) - A(p - p₀)

Differentiating both sides with respect to p:

(1/V) dV/dp = -A → dV/dp = -A V.

So dV = -A V dp.

Wait, but V is a function of p. So dV = -A V dp.

So substituting into W = ∫ P dV:

W = ∫ P dV = ∫ P (-A V) dp.

But from the equation V = V₀ exp(-A(p - p₀)), so I can substitute V in terms of p.

Wait, but P is expressed in terms of p as well. Wait, no. Wait, in this case, P is the pressure, which is the variable here. Wait, no, in the integral, the pressure is the function of volume, but here I'm changing variables to p. So when I write W = ∫ P dV, and dV is expressed in terms of dp, perhaps I can express P as a function of p.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think that in the integral, when changing variable from V to p, we have W = ∫ (from p1 to p2) P * (dV/dp) dp.

But P is the pressure, which in this case would be given by the equation. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, no. Because the equation given is ln(V/V₀) = -A (p - p₀), so solving for p gives p = p₀ - (1/A) ln(V/V₀). So P is a function of V, which we can write as P(V) = p₀ - (1/A) ln(V/V₀).

But perhaps it's easier to integrate with respect to p if I can express V in terms of p. So V(p) = V₀ exp( -A (p - p₀) )

So dV/dp = dV(p)/dp = V₀ exp( -A(p - p₀) ) * (-A) ) = -A V(p).

Which gives dV = -A V(p) dp.

Now, the work done is W = ∫ P dV. Since P is the pressure, which is a function of V, but I can write it in terms of p. Wait, no. Because in the integral ∫ P dV, P is the external pressure. Wait, but in a quasi-static process, the external pressure is almost equal to the internal pressure, which is given by the equation. So in a quasi-static process, the work is done against the internal pressure, which is P given by the equation. So yes, P in the integral is the same as the function we have.

So W = ∫ P dV = ∫ P * (dV) from initial to final state.

But since we're changing variables to p, let's express everything in terms of p.

So, W = ∫ (p_initial to p_final) [P] * [dV/dp dp]

But P is the same as p here because the process is quasi-static. Wait, is that correct? Hmm. Wait, in a quasi-static process, the system is in equilibrium, so the internal pressure P is equal to the external pressure at every step. So when you're doing work against the system, the pressure you're using in the integral is P, which is the same as p in this case.

So substituting:

W = ∫ (from p1 to p2) p * [dV/dp] dp.

But dV/dp is -A V(p), so:

W = ∫ (p1 to p2) p * (-A V(p)) dp.

But V(p) is given by V(p) = V₀ exp(-A(p - p₀)).

So substituting V(p):

W = -A V₀ ∫ (p1 to p2) p exp( -A (p - p₀) ) dp.

Hmm, that integral looks a bit complicated. Maybe integration by parts would help here. Let's let u = p, dv = exp(-A(p - p₀)) dp.

Then du = dp, and v = ∫ exp(-A(p - p₀)) dp.

Let me compute v:

Let me make substitution x = -A(p - p₀), so dx = -A dp → dp = -dx/A.

So v = ∫ exp(x) (-dx/A) ) = (-1/A) ∫ exp(x) dx = (-1/A) exp(x) + C.

Substituting back x = -A (p - p₀):

v = (-1/A) exp( -A(p - p₀) ) ) + C.

So now, integration by parts gives:

u v - ∫ v du.

So ∫ p exp(-A(p - p₀)) dp = u v - ∫ v du.

So u = p → u = p.

v = (-1/A) exp( -A (p - p₀) )

So u v = p * (-1/A) exp( -A (p - p₀) )

Then, ∫ v du = ∫ [ (-1/A) exp( -A (p - p₀) ) ] dp.

Which is (-1/A) * [ (-1/A) exp( -A (p - p₀) ) ) ] + C.

So putting it all together:

∫ p exp( -A (p - p₀) ) dp = [ (-p / A ) exp( -A (p - p₀) ) ) ] + (1/A²) exp( -A (p - p₀) ) ) + C.

So the integral from p1 to p2 is:

[ (-p / A ) exp( -A (p - p₀) ) + (1/A²) exp( -A (p - p₀) ) ) ] evaluated from p1 to p2.

Now, substituting back into W:

W = -A V₀ [ ( (-p/A) exp(-A(p-p₀)) + (1/A²) exp(-A(p-p₀)) ) ) ] evaluated from p1 to p2.

Simplify each term:

First, the expression inside the brackets is:

Term1: (-p/A) exp(...)

Term2: (1/A²) exp(...)

So, when we multiply by -A V₀, we get:

- A V₀ [ Term1 + Term2 ] from p1 to p2.

Let me compute each term:

For Term1 at p2 and p1:

Term1 at p2: (-p2/A) exp( -A (p2 - p₀) )

Term1 at p1: (-p1/A) exp( -A (p1 - p₀) )

Similarly for Term2:

Term2 at p2: (1/A²) exp( -A (p2 - p₀) )

Term2 at p1: (1/A²) exp( -A (p1 - p₀) )

So putting it all together:

W = -A V₀ [ ( (-p2/A) e1 + (1/A²) e1 ) - ( (-p1/A) e2 + (1/A²) e2 ) ) ]

Where e1 = exp( -A (p2 - p₀) ), e2 = exp( -A (p1 - p₀) )

Wait, this seems complicated and perhaps not leading me to the options given. Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Let me think again about the initial equation:

ln(V/V₀) = -A(p - p₀).

I can rearrange this as p = p₀ - (1/A) ln(V/V₀).

So, the pressure as a function of V is p(V) = p₀ - (1/A) ln(V/V₀).

Then, the work done W = ∫ p(V) dV from V1 to V2.

So, W = ∫ [ p₀ - (1/A) ln(V/V₀) ] dV.

This integral can be split into two parts:

W = p₀ (V2 - V1) - (1/A) ∫ ln(V/V₀) dV.

Now, the integral ∫ ln(V/V₀) dV.

Let me make substitution u = V/V₀ → V = u V₀ → dV = V₀ du.

So ∫ ln(u) * V₀ du = V₀ ∫ ln u du.

The integral of ln u du is u (ln u - 1) + C.

So ∫ ln u du = u ln u - u + C.

Substituting back:

V₀ [ u ln u - u ] from u1 to u2, where u1 = V1/V₀ and u2 = V2/V₀.

So the integral becomes:

V₀ [ (u2 ln u2 - u2) - (u1 ln u1 - u1) ) ]

Which is V₀ [ u2 ln u2 - u2 - u1 ln u1 + u1 ]

So putting it all back into W:

W = p₀ (V2 - V1) - (1/A) * V₀ [ (V2/V₀) ln(V2/V₀) - (V2/V₀) - (V1/V₀) ln(V1/V₀) + (V1/V₀) ) ]

Simplify each term:

= p₀ (V2 - V1) - (1/A) [ V2 ln(V2/V₀) - V2 - V1 ln(V1/V₀) + V1 ]

Hmm, but this still doesn't look like any of the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: W = (AV_0) (1 / p_2 - 1 / p_1)

B: W = (A / V_0) (p_1 - p_2)

C: W = (A / V_0) ln(p_2 / p_1)

D: W= (AV / 2) (p_2^2 - p_1^2)

E: W = -A ln(V / V_0) (p_2 - p_1)

F: W= - (AV / 2) (p_1^2 - p_2^2)

G: W = A(V_0 / V) (p_2 - p_1)

H: W= - (AV / 2) (p_2^2 - p_1^2)

I: W = A(V_0 + V) (p_2 - p_1)

Wait, none of these seem to match what I have. Am I making a mistake somewhere? Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps I should work with the equation in terms of p instead of V.

From ln(V/V₀) = -A(p - p₀), we can rearrange to get p = p₀ - (1/A) ln(V/V₀).

Wait, but if I take exponentials on both sides: V/V₀ = exp( -A (p - p₀) )

So V = V₀ exp( -A (p - p₀) )

Differentiating both sides with respect to p:

dV/dp = V₀ exp( -A(p - p₀) ) * (-A) ) = -A V.

So dV = -A V dp.

So then work done W = ∫ P dV = ∫ p * dV.

But since the process is quasi-static, the external pressure is equal to the internal pressure p. So substituting dV:

W = ∫ p * (-A V) dp.

But V can be expressed in terms of p: V = V₀ exp( -A (p - p₀) )

So:

W = -A V₀ ∫ p exp( -A (p - p₀) ) dp.

This integral looks tricky, but perhaps I can make a substitution. Let me let u = -A (p - p₀), so du/dp = -A → dp = -du/A.

Then, when p = p1, u1 = -A (p1 - p₀) = A (p₀ - p1).

Similarly, when p = p2, u2 = A (p₀ - p2).

Wait, but the integral is from p1 to p2, so substituting:

p = (p₀ - u/A )

dp = - du / A.

So substituting into the integral:

W = -A V₀ ∫ [ (p₀ - u/A ) exp(u) ] * ( - du / A )

The limits change from
