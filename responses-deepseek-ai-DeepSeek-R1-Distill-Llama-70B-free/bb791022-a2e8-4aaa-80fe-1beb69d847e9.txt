Okay, so I have this question about present value of a cash flow. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my finance formulas, but let me think. I remember that present value is about calculating the current worth of money that's going to be received in the future. The formula for that, right, it's something like PV = FV divided by (1 + r) raised to the power of n. 

Wait, yeah, the formula is PV = FV / (1 + r)^n. So FV is the future value, which in this case is $100. The discount rate is 5%, so that's r = 0.05. And the time is 5 years, so n=5.

Let me plug those numbers in. So it's 100 divided by (1.05)^5. I need to calculate (1.05)^5 first. Hmm, 1.05 to the power of 5. I think I can compute that step by step.

Wait, 1.05 squared is 1.1025. Then, to the third power would be 1.1025 * 1.05. Let me calculate that. 1.1025 * 1.05. Let's see, 1 times 1.05 is 1.05, 0.1025 * 1.05 is approximately 0.107625. Adding those together gives 1.157625. So 1.05^3 is about 1.157625.

Next, to the fourth power, multiply by 1.05 again. 1.157625 * 1.05. Let me compute that. 1.157625 * 1 = 1.157625, 1.157625 * 0.05 is 0.05788125. Adding them gives 1.21550625. So 1.05^4 is approximately 1.21550625.

Now, fifth power is multiplying by 1.05 once more. 1.21550625 * 1.05. So, 1.21550625 * 1 is 1.21550625, and 1.21550625 * 0.05 is 0.0607753125. Adding together gives 1.2762815625. So (1.05)^5 is about 1.2762815625.

So the denominator is approximately 1.2762815625. Then PV is 100 / 1.2762815625. Let me compute that division.

100 divided by 1.2762815625. Hmm, let's see. Let me approximate. 1.27628 is roughly 1.276. So 100 / 1.276. Let me think, 1.276 times 78 is about 1.276*70=89.32, 1.276*8=10.208, adding them gives 99.528. So 70 + 8 =78, and 78*1.276=99.528, which is just under 100. So 78 gives about 99.528. The difference is 100 -99.528=0.472. So how much more do I need? 0.472 /1.276 is about 0.37. So 78.37 would be approximately the PV. Wait, but my options are A:78.35, B:83.75, etc. So option A is 78.3526, which is very close to my approximation.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, using a calculator for (1.05)^5. Oh wait, I don't have a calculator, but maybe I can use logarithm or another method. Alternatively, I remember that (1.05)^5 is approximately 1.27628156 as I calculated earlier. So 100 / 1.27628156 equals approximately 78.3526.

Looking at the options, option A is 78.3526, which must be the correct answer.

The present value (PV) of a future cash flow is calculated using the formula:

\[
PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}
\]

Here, the future value (\(FV\)) is $100, the discount rate (\(r\)) is 5% (or 0.05), and the time (\(n\)) is 5 years. Plugging in these values:

\[
PV = \frac{100}{(1 + 0.05)^5}
\]

First, calculate \((1.05)^5\). Breaking it down step by step:

\[
(1.05)^2 = 1.1025
\]
\[
(1.05)^3 = 1.1025 \times 1.05 = 1.157625
\]
\[
(1.05)^4 = 1.157625 \times 1.05 = 1.21550625
\]
\[
(1.05)^5 = 1.21550625 \times 1.05 = 1.2762815625
\]

Now, divide \(100\) by \(1.2762815625\):

\[
PV = \frac{100}{1.2762815625} \approx 78.3526
\]

Comparing this result to the provided options, the closest match is **A: 78.3526**.
