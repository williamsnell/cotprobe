Okay, so I've got this question about the Soviet economy and the turnover tax. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Soviet economic system. I remember that it was a planned economy, so the government had a lot of control over production and distribution. They used various tools to manage the economy, including taxes and pricing mechanisms.

The question is asking about the role of the turnover tax. I think turnover tax is some kind of tax on businesses, but I'm not exactly sure how it worked in the Soviet context. Let me go through the options one by one to see which makes the most sense.

Option A: It's used to increase demand for goods. I'm not sure. Taxes can sometimes reduce demand if they make products more expensive, but maybe in this case it's different. I'll keep this in mind but not jump to conclusions.

Option B: A periodic levy on assets to encourage investment. That doesn't sound right. Levies on assets might discourage holding onto assets, but I don't see how that ties specifically to the turnover tax in the Soviet system.

Option C: Set by the central planning board. That sounds plausible because the Soviet economy was centrally planned. They probably controlled such taxes through a central authority. But does this answer the role of the tax itself?

Option D: A subsidy for exports. Subsidies are payments to encourage certain activities, but turnover tax is a tax, not a subsidy. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: Direct government rationing. Rationing is about controlling distribution, but I'm not sure how a tax would directly ration goods. Maybe through influencing prices, but I'm not certain. I'll think more on this.

Option F: A type of sales tax on total goods sold. That sounds familiar. I think turnover tax is similar to a sales tax, where businesses pay tax on their sales volume. But how does this fit into the Soviet economy's role?

Option G: A tariff on imports. Tariffs are trade barriers, but the question is about the Soviet internal economy, so G might not be the right context.

Option H: Adjusting money costs so demand matches supply. This sounds like it's about balancing the market. If the tax affects prices, it could influence how much people buy, making demand align with available quantity. That seems like a possible role, especially in a planned economy where supply and demand need to be balanced without market mechanisms.

Option I: Fee for operating in certain industries. That's possible, but I don't recall turnover tax being specifically about operating rights. It seems more about sales or revenue.

Option J: Income tax for social services. Turnover tax is on businesses' sales, not individuals' income, so J is probably wrong.

So narrowing it down, options C, F, and H are the strongest. Let me think deeper. The turnover tax in the Soviet system was a major source of government revenue. It was a tax on the sales of state enterprises. The government would set prices for goods, and the turnover tax would be the difference between the cost of production and the retail price. This way, the government could control the prices consumers paid and adjust the tax to influence demand.

Wait, so the tax was part of the pricing mechanism. By setting higher taxes on certain goods, the government could increase their prices, thereby possibly reducing demand if needed. Alternatively, lower taxes could make goods cheaper, increasing demand. But in a planned economy, they wanted to ensure that the quantity of goods produced matched the quantity demanded. So the turnover tax helped in adjusting prices so that people would buy what was available, preventing shortages or surpluses.

Looking back at the options, option H says it's a device for adjusting money costs to consumers so that demand matches supply. That fits with what I was thinking. The tax adjusts the final price, making sure that the quantity demanded aligns with what's available.

Option C says it's set by the central planning board, which is true, but it's more about the mechanism than the role. The question is about the role, so H explains the purpose, while C just explains who sets it.

So the correct answer should be H.

The turnover tax in the Soviet economy was a key mechanism used by the central planning authorities to influence prices and align the demand for goods with their available supply. It functioned by adjusting the final prices of consumer goods, ensuring that the quantities demanded by consumers roughly matched the quantities produced. This was crucial in a planned economy where market forces did not naturally balance supply and demand. By setting the turnover tax, the government could effectively control the prices consumers paid, thereby guiding demand to align with the available supply of goods. 

Among the options provided, option H correctly identifies the role of the turnover tax as a device for adjusting money costs to consumers to balance demand with supply. While option C is true in that the tax was set by the central planning board, it does not address the specific role of the tax in the economy. Therefore, the most accurate answer is:

H: Turnover tax is a device for adjusting the total money costs to consumers of each consumer good to a level at which the quantity demanded corresponds at least roughly to the quantity available.

Answer: H
