Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about uncertainty in kinetic energy. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that two students dropped a ball from rest and measured its speed just before impact. They estimated the uncertainty in the speed to be 10%. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the kinetic energy, assuming the mass's uncertainty is negligible. The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

I remember that kinetic energy (KE) is given by the formula KE = ½ mv². Since the mass's uncertainty is negligible, that means we only need to consider the uncertainty in the velocity (v) because mass (m) is effectively constant in this scenario.

Uncertainty propagation usually depends on how a variable is used in the equation. For kinetic energy, velocity is squared, so the percentage uncertainty in KE will be related to twice the percentage uncertainty in v. Because when you have a function like f(v) = v^n, the relative uncertainty becomes n times the relative uncertainty of v.

Let me break it down. If the speed v has an uncertainty of 10%, that means if v is some value, the uncertainty Δv is 0.10v. Now, KE depends on v squared, so the uncertainty in KE should be calculated based on that.

Using the formula for relative uncertainty (which is the same as percentage uncertainty when expressed as a percentage) for a function y = f(x), where f is a power function: if y = x^n, then (Δy/y) ≈ n*(Δx/x), assuming Δx is small.

In this case, KE = (1/2)m v², so n is 2 because v is squared. The 1/2 factor is a constant, so it doesn't affect the relative uncertainty.

So the relative uncertainty in KE should be 2 times the relative uncertainty in v. Since the uncertainty in v is 10%, the uncertainty in KE is 2 * 10% = 20%.

Wait, let me double-check that. Sometimes I get confused between absolute and relative uncertainties. The relative uncertainty in KE is the derivative of KE with respect to v multiplied by the relative uncertainty in v. The derivative of KE with respect to v is d(KE)/dv = m*v. So the relative uncertainty would be (m*v) * (Δv / v) ) / KE. Since KE is ½ m v², substituting that in, the m and v terms cancel out (because (m v) / (½ m v²) ) is 2/v * v ). So 2*(Δv/v). That gives 2 times the relative uncertainty in v, which is 10%, so 20%.

So the answer should be 20% uncertainty in kinetic energy. Looking at the options, H is 20%. So the correct choice is H.

To determine the uncertainty in the kinetic energy (KE) of the ball, we start with the formula for kinetic energy:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

Here, the mass \(m\) is constant, and the uncertainty in \(m\) is negligible. Therefore, the uncertainty in \(KE\) depends only on the uncertainty in the velocity \(v\). The problem states that the uncertainty in \(v\) is 10%.

When a variable is squared in a formula, the relative uncertainty (or percentage uncertainty) of the squared variable is approximately twice the relative uncertainty of the original variable. This is derived from the general rule for uncertainty propagation: if \(y = x^n\), the relative uncertainty in \(y\) is approximately \(n \times\) the relative uncertainty in \(x\). For \(KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2\), \(n = 2\), so the relative uncertainty in \(KE\) is:

\[
\text{Relative uncertainty in } KE = 2 \times \text{Relative uncertainty in } v
\]

Substituting the given uncertainty in \(v\) (10%):

\[
\text{Relative uncertainty in } KE = 2 \times 10\% = 20\%
\]

Thus, the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball is 20%. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**H: 20%**

Answer: H
