Okay, so I've got this math problem here: 28 multiplied by 42. Hmm, I need to find out what that equals and choose the correct option from A to J. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, I remember that multiplying two numbers can sometimes be broken down into easier steps. Maybe I can use the distributive property or something like that. Let's see, 28 times 42. Maybe I can split 42 into 40 and 2. So, 28 times 40 plus 28 times 2. That might make it easier.

Okay, so 28 times 40. Well, 28 times 4 is 112, right? So if I multiply that by 10, it's 1120. Got that part. Then, 28 times 2 is 56. So adding those together, 1120 plus 56 equals 1176. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check my steps.

Hmm, another way to think about it: 28 times 42. Maybe I can switch the numbers to make it simpler. Like, 42 times 28. Oh wait, that's the same thing, just commutative property. So maybe I can break down 28 into 20 and 8 instead. So 42 times 20 is 840, and 42 times 8 is 336. Adding those gives 840 + 336. Let me add those: 840 plus 300 is 1140, plus 36 is 1176. Okay, same result. So that seems correct.

Looking at the options, option F is 1,176. So that must be the right answer. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. 

Wait, another way: I can use the standard multiplication method. Let's try that.

First, multiply 8 times 42: 8*2=16, 8*4=32. So 336. Then, multiply 20 times 42, which is 840. Now add 336 and 840. 336 + 840 is 1176. Yep, same as before. So I'm confident the answer is 1176, which is option F.

The expression 28 × 42 can be calculated by breaking it down into simpler steps. 

First, split 42 into 40 and 2:
- 28 × 40 = 1,120
- 28 × 2 = 56

Adding these together:  
1,120 + 56 = 1,176.

To verify, another method involves breaking down 28 into 20 and 8:
- 42 × 20 = 840
- 42 × 8 = 336

Adding these together:  
840 + 336 = 1,176.

Both methods confirm that the result is 1,176. Comparing this with the options provided, the correct answer is **F: 1,176**.
