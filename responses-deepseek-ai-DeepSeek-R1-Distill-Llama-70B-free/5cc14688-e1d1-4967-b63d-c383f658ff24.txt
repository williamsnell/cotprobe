Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about the autoprotolysis of liquid ammonia. Hmm, I remember that autoprotolysis is when a substance can act as both an acid and a base, right? Like water does, where it can donate and accept protons.

The question is asking for the equilibrium equation and the expression for the equilibrium constant, and then it gives the K for liquid ammonia as 1e-22. Then they want to find how many molecules of ammonia are ionized in 1 mole of ammonia, considering the density of ammonia is 0.771 g/ml.

Wait, wait, I think the autoprotolysis of ammonia is similar to water's. For water, the equation is H2O ⇌ H+ + OH-. So for ammonia, NH3, the equation would be NH3 ⇌ NH4+ + NH2^-? Yeah, that sounds right. So the equilibrium is between ammonia molecules ionizing into ammonium and amide ions.

The equilibrium expression K would then be the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the reactants. So K = [NH4+][NH2^-] / [NH3]. Since it's a pure liquid, the concentration of NH3 is considered constant, but wait, no, because in the solution, it's in the liquid phase. But in K expressions, pure liquids and solids are not included because their concentrations don't change. Wait, but in this case, the solvent is NH3 itself. So the concentration of NH3 would be part of the equilibrium expression because it's the solvent undergoing autoprotolysis. Or maybe in this case, it's treated as a solvent, so its concentration is taken as constant, making K equal to [NH4+][NH2^-]. Wait, but according to my notes, for water autoprotolysis, Kw = [H+][OH-], and similarly for ammonia, they should have K = [NH4+][NH2^-]. So maybe in the expression, the [NH3] is considered a constant and incorporated into K. Or wait, no, because the problem states K_NH3 is 1e-22, which I think is the ion product, similar to Kw for water. So in that case, the expression would just be K = [NH4+][NH2^-], and that equals 1e-22.

So the first part of the question, the equilibrium equation is NH3 ⇌ NH4+ + NH2^-, and the equilibrium expression is K = [NH4+][NH2^-] = 1e-22.

Now, moving on to the second part. We need to find how many molecules of ammonia are ionized in 1 mole of ammonia. Let's think. Let's denote the concentration of NH4+ and NH2^- as x each because they're formed in a 1:1 ratio. So [NH4+] = x and [NH2^-] = x. Then, K = x * x = x² = 1e-22. So x² = 1e-22 → x = sqrt(1e-22) = 1e-11 M for each ion.

Wait, but wait, what is the total volume here? Because the problem gives the density, so maybe we need to find the volume of 1 mole of ammonia. Let's calculate that. The density is given as 0.771 g/ml. Molar mass of NH3 is 17 g/mol (14 for N, 3 for 3 H). So 1 mole is 17 grams. Density is mass/volume → volume = mass/density. So volume V = 17g / 0.771 g/ml. Let me calculate that.

17 / 0.771 ≈ let's see, 0.771 times 22 is about 17 (0.771 *20=15.42, 0.771*2=1.542 → 15.42+1.542=16.962, which is close to 17). So approximately 22.06 ml, or 0.02206 liters.

So the concentration x is 1e-11 M, which is 1e-11 mol per liter. So in 0.02206 liters, the number of moles of NH4+ (and NH2^-) is x * V = 1e-11 * 0.02206 ≈ 2.206e-13 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem is about the number of molecules ionized. So each ion comes from an ionized NH3 molecule. So for each NH4+ and NH2^-, one NH3 has ionized. So the total moles ionized would be 2x? Or wait, no, because each ionization event produces one NH4+ and one NH2^-. So each ionization consumes one NH3 and produces one of each ion. So the total number of ionized molecules is x per liter, but considering both ions, it's 2x? Or is it x, because each ionization event produces two ions from one molecule?

Wait, no. The reaction is NH3 ⇌ NH4+ + NH2^-. So each ionization produces one NH4+ and one NH2^- from one NH3. So the number of NH3 molecules that ionize is x, and the number of each ion is x. So the number of ionized molecules is x per liter. But wait, no, because each NH3 that ionizes produces two ions, but the number of NH3 molecules that ionized is x. So the total number of ionized NH3 molecules is x. So the moles of NH3 ionized is x, which is 1e-11 per liter.

But wait, the solution is in 0.02206 liters (from 1 mole). So the total moles ionized is x * V = 1e-11 mol/L * 0.02206 L ≈ 2.206e-13 mol.

Wait, no, wait. Because x is the concentration in the solution, which is 0.02206 L. So in that solution, the number of moles of NH4+ is x, and NH2^- is x, so total ionized NH3 is 2x? Or is it x because each ionization produces two ions? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of moles. Let me approach this again.

The total volume is V = 17g / 0.771g/ml ≈ 22.06 ml = 0.02206 L.

The concentration of each ion is x = 1e-11 M. So the moles of NH4+ = x * V = 1e-11 * 0.02206 ≈ 2.206e-13 mol. Similarly, moles of NH2^- is the same. So the total moles ionized is (2.206e-13 + 2.206e-13) = 4.412e-13 mol? But wait, that can't be right, because each ionization produces both ions from one NH3 molecule. So maybe the total moles of ionized NH3 is x, because each NH3 that ionizes gives both ions. So the moles would be x * V = 1e-11 * 0.02206 ≈ 2.206e-13 mol.

Wait, but each ionization event consumes one NH3 and produces one NH4+ and one NH2^-. So for each mole of NH3 that ionizes, you get one mole each of the ions. So the total ionized NH3 is x * V. So the moles ionized is x * V = 1e-11 * 0.02206 ≈ 2.206e-13 moles.

To find the number of molecules, multiply moles by Avogadro's number (6.022e23 molecules/mol). So 2.206e-13 mol * 6.022e23 = approx 1.329e11 molecules.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option C is 2.66e11, which is about double what I got. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the ionization produces two ions per molecule, so the total number of molecules ionized is 2*x*V. Let me think again. No, each molecule ionizes into two ions, but the number of molecules that ionize is x per liter. So the number of molecules ionized is x * V * Avogadro's number. So that's 1e-11 * 0.02206 L * 6.022e23.

Calculating that: 1e-11 * 0.02206 = 2.206e-13. Multiply by 6.022e23 gives 2.206e-13 * 6.022e23 = approx 1.329e11 molecules.

But looking at the options, option C is 2.66e11, which is about twice as much. Did I miss a factor of 2 somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate x correctly. Let me re-express:

We have K = [NH4+][NH2^-] = x^2 = 1e-22 → x = 1e-11 M.

But in the solution, the volume is 0.02206 L, so moles of NH4+ is x * V = 1e-11 * 0.02206 ≈ 2.206e-13 mol.

But that's the moles of each ion. But each mole of NH3 ionized gives one mole of each ion. So the moles of NH3 ionized is the same as the moles of NH4+ produced, which is 2.206e-13 mol.

Wait, but wait, if one mole of NH3 gives one mole of each ion, then the total moles ionized is x * V, which is 2.206e-13 mol.

Wait, but perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the concentration of NH3 is not 1/(Vm), but wait, I think I've got the correct approach.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the number of molecules in 1 mole of NH3. That's Avogadro's number, 6.022e23 molecules.

The fraction ionized is determined by the ionization. So let me model it as:

At equilibrium, [NH4+] = [NH2^-] = x. So x² = 1e-22 → x = 1e-11 M.

But the volume is V = 0.02206 L.

So the number of molecules ionized is x * V * Avogadro's number.

Wait, x is the molar concentration, so x * V gives moles, and times Avogadro's gives molecules.

So yes, x * V = 1e-11 * 0.02206 ≈ 2.206e-13 mol.

Multiply by 6.022e23 → 2.206e-13 * 6.022e23 = approx 1.329e11 molecules.

But none of the options exactly match this. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 2.66e11, which is about double. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in considering the volume. Let me check the volume calculation again.

Density is 0.771 g/ml. Molar mass of NH3 is 17.031 g/mol. So 1 mole is 17.031 grams.

Volume V = mass / density = 17.031 g / 0.771 g/ml.

Let me compute that more accurately. 17.031 / 0.771.

Hmm, 0.771 * 22 = let's see: 0.771 *20=15.42; 0.771*2=1.542. So 15.42 +1.542=16.962. The difference between 17.031 and 16.962 is 0.069 grams. So 0.069 / 0.771 = approx 0.0896 ml. So 22.0896 ml, which is 0.0220896 liters.

So V ≈ 0.02209 L.

So x * V = 1e-11 * 0.02209 = 2.209e-13 mol.

Multiply by Avogadro's number: 2.209e-13 * 6.022e23 = 1.33e11 molecules.

But the closest option is C: 2.66e11, which is about twice my result. Hmm.

Wait a minute, maybe the mistake is in the initial setup. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the K expression is written as (x)(x) = x² = 1e-22 → x=1e-11 M. So that part is correct.

But wait, another thought: in the solution, the total concentration is 1/(Vm) where Vm is the molar volume. But wait, no, because for a pure liquid, the concentration is usually considered as the density/(molar mass). Wait, maybe I should compute the concentration of NH3 as (density)/(molar mass) → which would be (0.771 g/ml) / (17.031 g/mol) → converting to mol/L.

Wait, 0.771 g/ml is 771 g/L. So 771 g/L /17.031 g/mol ≈ 45.3 mol/L. So the concentration of NH3 is about 45.3 M.

Wait, but in the ionization, the concentration of NH3 is considered to be constant, but perhaps that's not the case. Wait, no, in the expression for K, for a pure liquid, the concentration is taken as a constant and incorporated into K. So the K_NH3 is given as 1e-22, which is [NH4+][NH2^-].

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. For water, the autoprotolysis is H2O ⇌ H+ + OH-, and Kw = [H+][OH-] = 1e-14. So for ammonia, the same applies: K = [NH4+][NH2^-] = 1e-22.

So the initial approach was correct. So the number of ionized molecules is x * V * Avogadro's number. So that's 1e-11 M * 0.02209 L * 6.022e23.

Wait, but maybe the mistake is in considering the volume. Because 1 mole of NH3 is 17 grams, and with density 0.771 g/ml, the volume is 17 / 0.771 = ~22.06 ml, which is 0.02206 L. So that's correct.

So 1e-11 M is 1e-11 mol/L → in 0.02206 L, that's 1e-11 * 0.02206 = 2.206e-13 mol. Multiply by Avogadro's number: 2.206e-13 * 6.022e23 = approx 1.329e11 molecules. So about 1.33e11, which is 1.33 × 10^11.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.66 × 10^11, which is roughly double. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute x * V:

x = 1e-11 M = 1e-11 mol/L.

V = 17.031 g / 0.771 g/ml = (17.031 / 0.771) ml = 22.09 ml = 0.02209 L.

So x*V = 1e-11 * 0.02209 = 2.209e-13 mol.

Number of molecules = 2.209e-13 mol * 6.022e23 molecules/mol.

Let me calculate 2.209e-13 *6.022e23.

2.209e-13 *6.022e23 = (2.209 *6.022) * 1e10.

2.209 *6.022 ≈ 13.3 (since 2*6=12, 0.209*6≈1.25, 2*0.022≈0.044; but more accurately: 2.209 *6 = 13.254; 2.209 *0.022≈0.0486. So total ~13.254 + 0.0486 ≈13.3026.)

So 13.3026 * 1e10 = 1.33026e11 molecules, which is about 1.33e11.

But none of the options exactly match this. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A:45.3M molecules → 4.53e16 → no.

B:1e10 → no.

C:2.66e11 → maybe double our result.

D:7.5e8 → no.

E:5.55e22 → way too big.

F:1.2e20 → no.

G:8.99e14 → no.

H:3.01e12 → no.

I:4.42e-13 → no.

J:6.02e23 → Avogadro's number, which is 1 mole.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 because each ionization produces two ions, but the number of molecules ionized is x, as each ionization comes from one molecule.

Wait, but in the calculation, I considered x as the concentration of each ion, which comes from the ionization of x concentration of NH3. So the number of molecules ionized is x * V * Avogadro's number, which is 1e-11 * 0.02209 *6.022e23 ≈1.33e11.

But the option C is 2.66e11, which is exactly double. So perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation. Let me recompute the volume.

Density = 0.771 g/ml = 771 g/L.

Molar mass of NH3 is 17.031 g/mol.

So molarity (concentration) is density/(molar mass) = 771 /17.031 ≈ 45.3 M.

Wait, wait! Wait a minute. Oh no, I think I made a mistake here. Because earlier, I considered the volume as 22 ml for 1 mole, which is correct for volume. But in the K expression, the concentration of NH3 is actually 45.3 M, not 1 M. Wait, no, wait. Wait, for pure substances, like liquids, their concentration is considered constant and is incorporated into the equilibrium constant. So in the expression, K = [NH4+][NH2^-], because [NH3] is a constant and is part of K.

But wait, maybe I should think differently. If the concentration of NH3 is 45.3 M, then the actual K expression would be K = (x)(x)/[NH3] = x²/45.3. And if K_NH3 is given as
