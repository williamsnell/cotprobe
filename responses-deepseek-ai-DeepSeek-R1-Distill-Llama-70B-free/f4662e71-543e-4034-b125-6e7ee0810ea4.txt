Okay, so I have this question about calculating GNP, NNP, and NI using given data. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. 

First, I remember that GNP stands for Gross National Product. The formula for GNP is the same as GDP but includes the net income from foreign sources. Oh wait, but here we're probably starting from the expenditure side. 

The standard formula for GDP (which I think is the same as GNP if we're considering the expenditure approach) is: 

GNP = C + I + G + X - M

Where:
- C is Personal Consumption Expenditures
- I is Net Private Domestic Investment
- G is Government Purchases of Goods and Services
- X is Exports
- M is Imports

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing up GNP and GDP. Let me clarify. GNP includes income from domestic production by the country's citizens, regardless of where they are in the world. But for this calculation, I think we're using the expenditure approach. So maybe the formula is correct as I wrote.

Looking at the data provided:

- Personal consumption expenditures (C) = 230.9
- Net private domestic investment (I) = 63.4
- Government purchases (G) = 60.6
- Exports (X) =14.5
- Imports (M) =17.8

So plugging these into the formula:

GNP = 230.9 + 63.4 + 60.6 +14.5 -17.8

Let me calculate that step by step.

230.9 + 63.4 = 294.3
294.3 +60.6 = 354.9
354.9 +14.5 = 369.4
369.4 -17.8 = 351.6

So GNP is 351.6. Hmm, looking at the options, I see that option G has GNP=351.6. Option E has GNP=338.5, which is lower. So that's one point.

Next, NNP is Net National Product. NNP is GNP minus the capital consumption allowance (depreciation). The capital consumption allowance given is 12.3.

So NNP = GNP - Capital Consumption Allowance.

NNP = 351.6 - 12.3 = 339.3? Wait, wait. Let me check the numbers. 351.6 minus 12.3 is indeed 339.3. But looking at the options, I don't see 339.3. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating GNP.

Wait, let me recheck the GNP calculation. Let's do it again:

C = 230.9
I =63.4 → 230.9 +63.4 =294.3
G=60.6 → 294.3+60.6=354.9
X=14.5 → 354.9 +14.5=369.4
M=17.8 → 369.4 -17.8=351.6. So that's correct.

So NNP = 351.6 -12.3 = 339.3. But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach to calculate NI (National Income), and then deriving the others from that.

Wait, let me think about National Income (NI). I remember that NI is calculated by taking GNP and subtracting depreciation (capital consumption allowance) and also subtracting indirect business taxes and adding transfer payments and subsidies, but I might be getting confused here. Alternatively, National Income is the sum of all incomes earned by factors of production. 

Another approach is that NI can be calculated as GNP minus depreciation (capital consumption allowance) minus indirect business taxes plus net transfers. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The formula for NI is:

NI = GNP - Capital Consumption Allowance - Indirect Business Taxes + Transfer Payments - Personal Taxes?

Wait, no, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me recall that the National Income is the sum of compensation of employees, proprietors' income, rental income, corporate profits, and net interest. But perhaps another way is to calculate it from GNP.

Alternatively, I remember that:

NI = GNP - (Indirect Business Taxes + Capital Consumption Allowance) + Net Income from Abroad.

Wait, but in this problem, we're given data that includes compensation of employees, which is part of NI. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute NI using the income approach.

Wait, let's look back. The problem gives us several components, including Compensation of employees, which is 195.6. So perhaps I should compute NI using the income approach.

The income approach for NI is:

NI = Compensation of Employees + Proprietors' Income + Rental Income + Corporate Profits + Net Interest.

But the given data doesn't include all these components. Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives us enough to compute NI using another method.

Another formula for NI is:

NI = GNP - Capital Consumption Allowance - Indirect Business Taxes + Transfer Payments

Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but let me try. Let's see, the given data includes:

- Compensation of employees: 195.6
- Capital consumption allowance:12.3
- Indirect business taxes:13.1
- Transfer payments:14.2
- Personal taxes:43.0

Wait, perhaps I should compute NI as the sum of compensation of employees, plus other incomes, but maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is:

NI = GNP - (Capital Consumption Allowance + Indirect Business Taxes) + (Transfer Payments - Personal Taxes).

Wait, I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps NI is calculated as the sum of compensation of employees, plus other income components.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. The expenditure approach gives us GNP as 351.6. Then NNP is 351.6 - 12.3 = 339.3. Now, to find NI, perhaps we subtract indirect business taxes and add transfer payments.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. National Income is calculated by starting with GNP and then subtracting capital consumption allowance (depreciation) and indirect business taxes, and adding transfer payments and net foreign factor income. But since the problem doesn't mention net foreign factor income, perhaps we can ignore it.

So NI = GNP - Capital Consumption Allowance - Indirect Business Taxes + Transfer Payments.

So plugging in the numbers:

NI = 351.6 -12.3 -13.1 +14.2

Let me compute this step by step.

351.6 -12.3 = 339.3

339.3 -13.1 = 326.2

326.2 +14.2 = 340.4

Wait, that gives NI as 340.4, which isn't matching any of the options. Hmm. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps NI is calculated differently. Another way: NI is the sum of all incomes earned by households, which includes compensation of employees, plus other incomes. But the data only gives compensation of employees as 195.6. So perhaps this approach isn't possible without more data.

Wait, perhaps I should use the income approach. Let me recall that:

NI = Compensation of Employees + Rents + Interest + Profits + Proprietors' Income.

But without data on the other components, I can't calculate it directly. So maybe I'm supposed to calculate it from GNP using the formula:

NI = GNP - (Indirect Business Taxes + Capital Consumption Allowance) + (Transfer Payments)

Wait, I think I saw this formula before. So let me try that.

So NI = GNP - (Indirect Business Taxes + Capital Consumption Allowance) - Personal Taxes + Transfer Payments + Net Imports?

No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps:

NI = GNP - Capital Consumption Allowance - Indirect Business Taxes - Personal Taxes + Transfer Payments.

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the standard formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

NNP = GNP - Capital Consumption Allowance

And National Income (NI) is NNP minus indirect business taxes plus transfer payments.

Wait, let me check this. No, I think the correct relation is:

National Income (NI) = NNP - Indirect Business Taxes + Transfer Payments.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's look up the correct formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the identity:

GNP = C + I + G + X - M

But also, another formula is:

GNP = NI + Capital Consumption Allowance + Indirect Business Taxes - Transfer Payments - Net Factor Income Abroad

Wait, perhaps I should approach it this way. So rearranging:

NI = GNP - Capital Consumption Allowance - Indirect Business Taxes + Transfer Payments + Net Factor Income Abroad.

But in this problem, I don't see a figure for Net Factor Income from Abroad, so perhaps it's zero or included in other terms.

So, NI = GNP (351.6) - Capital Consumption Allowance (12.3) - Indirect Business Taxes (13.1) + Transfer Payments (14.2).

So let's calculate that:

351.6 -12.3 = 339.3

339.3 -13.1 = 326.2

326.2 +14.2 = 340.4

So NI would be 340.4. But looking at the options, I don't see that number. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the GNP calculation. Let me double-check that.

GNP = C + I + G + X - M

C=230.9, I=63.4, G=60.6, X=14.5, M=17.8.

So 230.9 +63.4 = 294.3

294.3 +60.6 = 354.9

354.9 +14.5 = 369.4

369.4 -17.8 = 351.6

Yes, that's correct. So GNP is 351.6.

Then NNP is GNP - Capital Consumption Allowance: 351.6 -12.3= 339.3.

Now, for NI, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me try another approach. Maybe NI is calculated as compensation of employees plus other incomes. But since we don't have other income data, perhaps I'm supposed to compute it using the formula NI = NNP - Indirect Business Taxes - Personal Taxes + Transfer Payments.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

NI = Compensation of Employees + Rents + Interest + Profits + Proprietors Income.

But without those numbers, I can't compute it that way. Alternatively, perhaps the NI is calculated as NNP minus indirect business taxes plus transfer payments.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to look at the options to see which ones fit.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option G: GNP=351.6, NNP=338.5, NI=363.9.

Wait, how can NI be higher than GNP? That doesn't make sense because NI should be less than GNP since it excludes depreciation and other things. So maybe that's not right.

Option E: GNP=338.5, NNP=351.6, NI=363.9 → This can't be right because NNP should be lower than GNP.

Option J: GNP=363.9, NNP=338.5, NI=351.6 → GNP as 363.9 would mean my calculation was wrong. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the GNP calculation. Let me compute it again.

C=230.9, I=63.4, G=60.6, X=14.5, M=17.8.

So 230.9 +63.4 =294.3

294.3 +60.6=354.9

354.9 +14.5=369.4

369.4 -17.8=351.6

So GNP is 351.6, so any option where GNP is 351.6 is possible. Let's check which options have that.

Looking at the options:

Option G: GNP=351.6, NNP=338.5, NI=363.9.

Wait, but NNP should be GNP minus capital consumption allowance (12.3). So 351.6 -12.3=339.3, not 338.5. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating NNP.

Wait, 351.6 minus 12.3 is 339.3, but none of the options have that. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute NNP as GNP minus capital consumption allowance, which I did, getting 339.3. But none of the options have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the GNP calculation. Let me recalculate:

C=230.9

I=63.4 → 230.9+63.4=294.3

G=60.6 → 294.3+60.6=354.9

X=14.5 → 354.9+14.5=369.4

M=17.8 → 369.4-17.8=351.6. So that's correct.

So NNP is 351.6-12.3=339.3.

But looking at the options, none have NNP=339.3. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, maybe NNP is Net National Product, which is GNP minus depreciation (capital consumption allowance) and also minus indirect business taxes and plus transfer payments. No, I think that's National Income. Let me get this straight.

I think the correct steps are:

1. Calculate GNP using the expenditure approach: done, 351.6.

2. NNP = GNP - Capital Consumption Allowance → 351.6 -12.3=339.3.

3. National Income (NI) = NNP - Indirect Business Taxes + Transfer Payments.

So NI=339.3 -13.1 +14.2 = 339.3 +1.1=340.4.

But none of the options have 340.4. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula for NI is different. Maybe NI is calculated as GNP minus Capital Consumption Allowance minus Indirect Business Taxes plus Transfer Payments.

So NI=351.6 -12.3 -13.1 +14.2.

Which is 351.6 -25.4 +14.2 = 326.2 +14.2=340.4.

Still 340.4. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is NI = GNP - (Capital Consumption Allowance + Indirect Business Taxes) + (Transfer Payments - Personal Taxes).

So that would be:

351.6 - (12.3 +13.1) + (14.2 -43.0)

=351.6 -25.4 + (-28.8)

=326.2 -28.8=297.4. That's even lower, which doesn't match any option.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Option J: GNP=363.9, NNP=338.5, NI=351.6.

But according to my calculation, GNP is 351.6. So that can't be right.

Option G: GNP=351.6, NNP=338.5, NI=363.9.

But according to my calculation, NNP should be 339.3, and NI 340.4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial GNP calculation. Let me try adding all the components again.

C=230.9

I=63.4 → 230.9+63.4=294.3

G=60.6 → 294.3+60.6=354.9

X=14.5 → 354.9+14.5=369.4

M=17.8 → 369.4-17.8=351.6.

No, that's correct. So GNP is 351.6.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula for NI. Let me think again.

Another approach is that National Income (NI) is equal to the sum of all the incomes: compensation of employees (195.6), plus proprietors' income, plus rental income, plus corporate profits, plus net interest. But since we don't have all these figures, perhaps this approach isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the NI can be calculated by taking the GNP and subtracting capital consumption allowance, indirect business taxes, and personal taxes, then adding transfer payments.

Wait, let me try that:

NI = GNP - Capital Consumption Allowance - Indirect Business Taxes - Personal Taxes + Transfer Payments.

Plugging in the numbers:

351.6 -12.3 -13.1 -43.0 +14.2

Calculating step by step:

351.6 -12.3 = 339.3

339.3 -13.1=326.2

326.2 -43.0=283.2

283.2 +14.2=297.4.

Hmm, that's lower than before, and doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps personal taxes are treated differently. Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Let me try to look at the options again to see which one fits the GNP I calculated.

The only options with GNP=351.6 are options G and H. But looking at option G: GNP=351.6, NNP=338.5, NI=363.9.

Wait, how could NI be higher than GNP? That doesn't make sense because NI should exclude depreciation, which would make it lower than GNP. So option G's NI being 363.9 is higher than GNP of 351.6, which can't be right. So perhaps option G is incorrect.

Option H has GNP=376.1, which doesn't match my calculation, so it's out.

Looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial GNP calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I missed a component. Let me list all the given data again:

Compensation of employees:195.6 → not used in GNP calculation via expenditure approach.

U.S. exports:14.5 → included.

Capital consumption allowance:12.3 → not in GNP.

Government purchases:60.6 → included.

Indirect business taxes:13.1 → not in GNP.

Net private domestic investment:63.4 → included.

Transfer payments:14.2 → not in GNP.

Imports:17.8 → included.

Personal taxes:43.0 → not in GNP.

Personal consumption expenditures:230.9 → included.

So I think I included all the necessary components. So GNP=351.6.

Wait,
