Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the partial derivatives of a vector function. Hmm, a is given as (u²v, u + e^v, u + v²). I need to find three things: the first partial derivatives ∂a/∂u and ∂a/∂v, and then the mixed second partial derivative ∂²a/∂u∂v.

Let me start by recalling how to compute partial derivatives. For each component of the vector, I treat the others as constants. So, I'll go through each component one by one.

First, let's compute ∂a/∂u. That means I'll take the partial derivative of each component of a with respect to u.

The first component of a is u²v. Taking the partial derivative with respect to u, treating v as a constant. The derivative of u² is 2u, so 2u*v, which is 2uv.

The second component is u + e^v. The derivative of u with respect to u is 1. The derivative of e^v with respect to u is zero since v is treated as a constant. So this component becomes 1.

The third component is u + v². The derivative of u is 1, and v² is treated as a constant, so derivative is zero. So this component is also 1.

So ∂a/∂u is (2uv, 1, 1).

Next, let's compute ∂a/∂v. Again, taking each component's partial derivative with respect to v, treating u as a constant.

First component: u²v. Partial derivative with respect to v is u².

Second component: u + e^v. The derivative of u is zero, and the derivative of e^v is e^v. So this component is e^v.

Third component: u + v². The derivative of u is zero, and the derivative of v² is 2v. So this component is 2v.

So ∂a/∂v is (u², e^v, 2v).

Now, the mixed second partial derivative ∂²a/∂u∂v. This means I take the partial derivative of ∂a/∂v with respect to u. Alternatively, since mixed partials are equal if the function is sufficiently smooth (Clairaut's theorem), I could also take the partial derivative of ∂a/∂u with respect to v. Let me think which is easier.

Let me take ∂a/∂v, which is (u², e^v, 2v), and compute its derivative with respect to u.

First component: u². The derivative with respect to u is 2u.

Second component: e^v. Since we're taking the derivative with respect to u, and e^v doesn't depend on u, it's zero.

Third component: 2v. Again, treating v as a constant, the derivative with respect to u is zero.

So the mixed partial derivative ∂²a/(∂u∂v) is (2u, 0, 0).

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, I could compute the derivative of ∂a/∂u with respect to v. Let's see:

∂a/∂u is (2uv, 1, 1). Taking the partial derivative with respect to v:

First component: 2uv. Derive with respect to v gives 2u.

Second component: 1. Derive with respect to v is zero.

Third component: 1. Derive with respect to v is zero.

So the same result: (2u, 0, 0). That's consistent.

Now, looking at the options:

Option H is: (∂a/∂u) = (2uv,1,1), (∂a/∂v) = (u², e^v, 2v), and ∂²a/∂u∂v = (2u, 0, 0). So that matches exactly.

Wait, let me check:

Looking at the options:

Option H: 1) (2uv, 1, 1), 2) (u², e^v, 2v), 3) (2u, 0, 0). Yep, that's exactly what I got.

Looking at other options to make sure:

Option F: ∂²a is (2u,0,0) as third part, but for the second part, ∂a/∂v is (u², e^v, 2v), which matches, and the first part is (2uv,1,0). Wait, no, wait: F's first part is (2uv,1,0), but I got (2uv,1,1). So F's first component's third entry is 0. So F isn't correct.

Option H's first derivative is correct. So the correct answer should be option H.

To solve the problem, we need to compute the partial derivatives of the vector function **a** = (u²v, u + eᵛ, u + v²). Specifically, we need to find:

1. **∂a/∂u**  
2. **∂a/∂v**  
3. **∂²a/∂u∂v**

### 1. Computing ∂a/∂u
For each component of **a**, we take the partial derivative with respect to **u**, treating **v** as a constant:  
- First component: ∂(u²v)/∂u = 2uv  
- Second component: ∂(u + eᵛ)/∂u = 1  
- Third component: ∂(u + v²)/∂u = 1  

Thus, **∂a/∂u = (2uv, 1, 1)**.

---

### 2. Computing ∂a/∂v
For each component of **a**, we take the partial derivative with respect to **v**, treating **u** as a constant:  
- First component: ∂(u²v)/∂v = u²  
- Second component: ∂(u + eᵛ)/∂v = eᵛ  
- Third component: ∂(u + v²)/∂v = 2v  

Thus, **∂a/∂v = (u², eᵛ, 2v)**.

---

### 3. Computing ∂²a/∂u∂v
We first compute ∂a/∂v = (u², eᵛ, 2v) and then take the partial derivative of this result with respect to **u**:  
- First component: ∂(u²)/∂u = 2u  
- Second component: ∂(eᵛ)/∂u = 0 (since eᵛ does not depend on u)  
- Third component: ∂(2v)/∂u = 0 (since 2v does not depend on u)  

Thus, **∂²a/∂u∂v = (2u, 0, 0)**.

---

### Final Answer
From the computations above:  
- **∂a/∂u = (2uv, 1, 1)**  
- **∂a/∂v = (u², eᵛ, 2v)**  
- **∂²a/∂u∂v = (2u, 0, 0)**  

The option that matches these results is **H**.
