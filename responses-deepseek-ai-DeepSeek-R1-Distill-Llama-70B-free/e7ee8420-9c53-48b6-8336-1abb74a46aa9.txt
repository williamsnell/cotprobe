Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Supreme Court and what happens when an appeal is made to it. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is asking what the Supreme Court usually does when an appeal is made. The options are A through J. I'm a bit rusty on my civics, but I'll try to remember.

First, I know that the Supreme Court is the highest court in the land. It doesn't handle all cases; instead, it's selective about which ones it takes. So when someone appeals to the Supreme Court, they're usually asking for a review of a lower court's decision.

Wait, I remember something about the Supreme Court having discretion over which cases it accepts. They don't have to take every appeal that comes their way. So if someone files an appeal, the Court can choose to hear it or not. If they don't want to hear it, they just refuse the appeal.

So looking at the options, option C is "refuses to hear the appeal." That sounds right because the Supreme Court doesn't automatically take every case. They have a process where they decide whether to grant a writ of certiorari, which means they'll review the case. If they deny cert, they're refusing the appeal, and the lower court's decision stands.

Other options don't seem right. Option A and E are about ruling in favor of one party, but the Supreme Court doesn't usually do that without hearing the case. Option B is about ordering a retrial, which I think is more what a higher court might do if it finds an error, but the Supreme Court might reverse or remand instead of ordering a retrial. Option D dismisses the case entirely, but that's more about not taking it up rather than refusing an appeal. Option G says they automatically accept, which I know isn't true because they are selective. The rest of the options like mistrials or juries don't apply here because the Supreme Court doesn't handle trials, just appeals.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be C: refuses to hear the appeal.

The Supreme Court has the discretion to choose which cases it will hear. When an appeal is made, the Court typically refuses to hear many of them, especially if they don't meet certain criteria for review. This is done through the process of granting or denying a writ of certiorari. If the Court refuses the appeal, the lower court's decision stands. 

The other options are incorrect because the Supreme Court doesn't automatically accept appeals, rule in favor of a party without hearing the case, order retrials, or dismiss cases entirely in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: refuses to hear the appeal.
