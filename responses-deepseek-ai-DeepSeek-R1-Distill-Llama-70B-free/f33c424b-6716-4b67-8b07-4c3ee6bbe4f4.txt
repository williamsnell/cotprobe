Okay, so I've got this question about affective disorders as described in the DSM-III. Hmm, I remember that DSM-III was a significant revision in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published in 1980. It introduced a lot of changes in how mental disorders were classified.

Affective disorders... I think they're related to mood. So, affective disorders would include conditions like depression and bipolar disorder. Wait, in DSM-III, how were they categorized? I recall that DSM-III made distinctions based on the type of mood disturbance and the duration of symptoms.

Looking at the options:

Option A says they're always chronic. That doesn't sound right. I think some can be episodic, like major depressive episodes, which are time-limited.

Option B says categorized solely by duration, ignoring mood. No, I remember that mood was a big factor. Like, whether the person was depressed, manic, etc.

Option C claims they're only based on predominant mood. That's partially true, but I think there was more to it. They might have considered other symptoms too, not just mood.

Option D: Disturbance of mood with related symptoms, and categories like depressed, manic, or bipolar, then further divided into episodic, chronic, atypical. That sounds more accurate. Episodic would be like major depressive episodes, chronic could be dysthymia, and atypical might refer to specific presentations.

Option E says mood instability due to external factors. I don't think that's the case. DSM-III was more about the symptom presentation than the cause, whether internal or external.

Option F mentions only extreme happiness or mania. No, because depression is a big part of affective disorders too.

Option G says they're not recognized in DSM-III. That's wrong because DSM-III definitely included affective disorders.

Option H: Single episode of depression, no recurrence. No, because bipolar disorders have manic episodes and recurrences.

Option I: Only depressive episodes without mania. No, because bipolar disorders include mania.

Option J: Based on cognitive impairments. No, affective disorders are about mood primarily.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be D.
