Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about money supply, specifically cash reserves and how they relate to the total money supply.

The problem says that the public wants to hold 15% of their total money balances as cash, and the rest as bank deposits. Banks, on the other hand, hold cash reserves equal to 12% of their deposits. The total money supply is $200 billion, and I need to find out the total cash required for both the banks and the public.

Wait, so the total money supply is M = 200 billion. The public's money is split into cash and deposits. Let me think about that.

Let me break it down. The public holds 15% as cash, so that's 0.15 * M, right? Because M is the total money supply. So public cash would be 0.15 * 200, which is $30 billion. But wait, that's the cash the public holds. But the banks also hold cash as reserves.

So the total cash required is the cash held by the public plus the cash held by the banks as reserves. So I need to find both parts.

First, I'll calculate the public's cash. That's straightforward: 15% of 200 billion. 0.15 * 200 = 30. So the public holds $30 billion in cash.

Now, the rest of the money supply is in bank deposits. So if total M is 200 billion, and 30 billion is cash, then the deposits are 200 - 30 = $170 billion. So public deposits are $170 billion.

But wait, no, I think I might be making a mistake here. Because when the public holds deposits, those deposits are in the banks. So the banks have to hold reserves against those deposits. The problem states that banks hold 12% of deposits as cash reserves.

So the reserves are 12% of the deposits. So the bank's required reserves would be 0.12 * deposits. But what's the deposits here? Let me make sure.

Wait, the public's deposits are $170 billion. So the banks need to hold 12% of that as reserves. So reserves = 0.12 * 170 = 20.4. So the banks hold $20.4 billion in reserves.

So the total cash required is the public's cash plus the bank's reserves. That would be 30 + 20.4 = 50.4 billion.

Wait, but let me think again. Because when the public holds cash, that cash is part of the total money supply, but the banks' reserves are also part of the total money supply? Or is it that the total money supply includes both the cash in circulation (public's cash) and the deposits.

Wait, no, the total money supply M is typically defined as the sum of cash in circulation and bank deposits. So M = cash + deposits. So in this case, M = 200 billion = cash held by public + deposits.

So, the cash held by the public is 15% of M, which is 30 billion, and deposits are 85% of M, which is 170 billion. But the banks have to hold reserves against those deposits. So the reserves are 12% of deposits, which is 0.12 * 170 = 20.4 billion.

So the total cash in the system is the cash held by the public (30 billion) plus the cash held by the banks as reserves (20.4 billion), totaling 50.4 billion.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when banks hold reserves, that's part of the total cash in the system. So the total cash required is the sum of both. So 30 + 20.4 = 50.4, which is option B.

Let me check the options again. Option B is $50.4 billion. That's what I get.

Alternatively, let me approach this using the money multiplier concept to see if I get the same answer. The money multiplier formula is:

Money Supply (M) = (1 + c) * (Reserve Requirement (rr)) / (c + rr)

Wait, no, the standard formula is M = (1 / (c + rr(1 - c))) * C, where C is the total cash.

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, the money multiplier (MM) is 1 / (reserve requirement + cash ratio). But let me think.

Wait, the cash ratio for the public is 15%, and the reserve ratio for banks is 12%. So the money multiplier would be 1/(0.15 + 0.12*(1 - 0.15)).

Wait, let's compute that:

0.12*(1 - 0.15) = 0.12*0.85 = 0.102.

So the denominator is 0.15 + 0.102 = 0.252.

So MM = 1 / 0.252 ≈ 3.968.

But the total money supply is 200 billion. So the total cash (C) can be found by C = M / MM.

So C = 200 / 3.968 ≈ 50.4 billion. Which matches what I got earlier.

So that's consistent. Therefore, the correct answer should be B: $50.4 billion.

To determine the total amount of cash required for both the public and the banks, we start by analyzing the given information:

1. **Public's Cash Holdings**: The public wishes to hold 15% of the total money supply ($200 billion) as cash.  
   \[
   \text{Public Cash} = 0.15 \times 200 = \$30 \text{ billion}.
   \]

2. **Public's Deposits**: The remainder of the money supply is held as bank deposits.  
   \[
   \text{Public Deposits} = 200 - 30 = \$170 \text{ billion}.
   \]

3. **Bank Reserves**: Banks are required to hold cash reserves equal to 12% of their deposits.  
   \[
   \text{Bank Reserves} = 0.12 \times 170 = \$20.4 \text{ billion}.
   \]

4. **Total Cash Required**: The total cash required is the sum of the cash held by the public and the cash reserves held by the banks.  
   \[
   \text{Total Cash} = 30 + 20.4 = \$50.4 \text{ billion}.
   \]

Thus, the total amount of cash required for use by both the banks and the public is **$50.4 billion**.
