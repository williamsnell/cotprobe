Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about calculating the amount Shepp's Store paid for the camping hotplates. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with trade discounts and terms, the process usually involves applying the trade discount first, then any cash discounts if applicable. 

The problem states that Shepp's Store bought the hotplates for $56.65 minus a trade discount of 10%. So, I think the first step is to calculate the price after the trade discount. 

Wait, trade discount is 10%, so I need to find 10% of $56.65 and subtract that from the original price. Alternatively, since it's a 10% discount, I can just multiply $56.65 by (1 - 0.10) which is 0.90. 

Let me compute that: 56.65 * 0.90. Hmm, 56.65 times 0.9. Let's see, 56.65 times 0.9. Well, 56 times 0.9 is 50.4, and 0.65 times 0.9 is 0.585. Adding those together, 50.4 + 0.585 equals 50.985. So the price after the trade discount is $50.985. I can round that to $50.99 for now.

Next, the terms are given as (2/10), (n/30). I think that means 2% discount if paid within 10 days, and the net is due in 30 days. So the n here is 30. 

Shepp's Store paid the bill on December 20. The invoice was on December 10. So how many days is that? Let me count. From the 10th to the 20th is 10 days. So they're paying within the 10-day window. That means they can take the 2% discount.

So now I need to apply the 2% discount to the price after the trade discount. The amount after trade discount is $50.985. Taking 2% off of that.

Calculating 2% of 50.985: 0.02 * 50.985 = 1.0197. So the discount is $1.0197. Subtract that from $50.985.

50.985 - 1.0197 = 49.9653. Rounding to the nearest cent would make it $49.97.

Looking at the options, option B is $49.97, which should be the correct answer.

Wait, did I miss anything? Let me double-check. The trade discount is applied first, correct. Then the cash discount because they paid within 10 days. Yep, that seems right. So the answer should be B.

The problem involves calculating the amount Shepp's Store paid for camping hotplates after applying a trade discount and a cash discount. 

1. **Trade Discount Calculation**:  
   The original price is $56.65, and a 10% trade discount is applied.  
   \[
   \text{Price after trade discount} = 56.65 \times (1 - 0.10) = 56.65 \times 0.90 = 50.985 \, \text{(rounded to \$50.99)}.
   \]

2. **Cash Discount Calculation**:  
   The terms (2/10), (n/30) indicate a 2% cash discount if payment is made within 10 days. Shepp's Store paid on December 20, which is within the 10-day window.  
   Applying the 2% discount to the price after the trade discount:  
   \[
   \text{Cash discount} = 50.985 \times 0.02 = 1.0197.
   \]  
   Subtracting the cash discount:  
   \[
   \text{Final amount paid} = 50.985 - 1.0197 = 49.9653 \, \text{(rounded to \$49.97)}.
   \]

Thus, the amount paid is **$49.97**, corresponding to option **B**.
