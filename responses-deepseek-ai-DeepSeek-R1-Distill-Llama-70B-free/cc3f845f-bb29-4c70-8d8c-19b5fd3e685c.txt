Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the pressure inside a boiler that contains both liquid water and steam at a temperature of 225°F. I remember that when a substance is at its boiling point, the pressure is a function of temperature. So I think this is a phase change problem, probably involving the vapor pressure of water.

But wait, the given data includes the enthalpy of vaporization at 212°F, which is the boiling point of water at 1 atm (14.7 psi). The specific volumes of the vapor and liquid phases are also provided. Hmm, I'm not sure how all these fit together.

I think I should recall the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to temperature. The equation is ln(P2/P1) = (h_lv)(1/T1 - 1/T2) / R, where h_lv is the enthalpy of vaporization, T is the temperature in absolute units, and R is the gas constant. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Alternatively, maybe I should use the steam tables to find the pressure at 225°F.

Oh wait, the problem gives me specific volumes. Wait, specific volume is the reciprocal of density. The specific volume of vapor is 26.80 ft³/lbm, and liquid is 0.01672 ft³/lbm. That rings a bell. Oh right, in the Rankine cycle, we use these values to determine the state. But how does that tie into pressure?

Wait, at a given temperature, the pressure of the saturated vapor (steam) is what we're looking for. So for water at 225°F, what's the saturation pressure? But I don't have a steam table here. So maybe the given data is enough to use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation to find the pressure at 225°F.

Wait, the enthalpy of vaporization given is at 212°F, which is 100°C, standard boiling point. So I can use that as my reference point. Let me list the given data:

T1 = 212°F = 680.67 °R (since °R = °F + 459.67)
P1 = 1 atm = 14.7 psi
h_lv = 970.3 Btu/lbm
v_g = 26.80 ft³/lbm (vapor)
v_f = 0.01672 ft³/lbm (liquid)
T2 = 225°F = 684.67 °R

Wait, but I'm not sure if I need v_f and v_g here. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is more about the latent heat and the change in specific volume between phases. Oh, right! The Clapeyron equation is (dP/dT) = (h_lv) / (T (v_g - v_f)).

But since h_lv is given, and v_g and v_f are given, perhaps I can use this to approximate the pressure change from 212°F to 225°F.

Wait, but wait. The Clapeyron equation is for the phase boundary, so for each T, there's a P where the liquid and vapor coexist. So the question is about the pressure when water and steam coexist at 225°F. So we can model this using the Clapeyron equation.

But since it's an equation that's differential, for a small change in T, we can approximate the change in P as delta_P = (h_lv / (T (v_g - v_f))) * delta_T.

Wait, but let's think in terms of the integrated form of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, assuming that h_lv is constant and the specific volume change is v_g - v_f. So the equation is ln(P2/P1) = (h_lv / R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1), assuming R is the gas constant for water vapor. Wait, but wait, I think I might have the equation wrong.

Alternatively, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is often written as ln(P2/P1) = (h_lv / R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1), but wait, R here is the specific gas constant for water vapor. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the more general form where the equation is ln(P2/P1) = [h_lv (1/T1 - 1/T2)] / (R), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation should be:

ln(P2/P1) = (h_lv / (R)) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (v_g - v_l)

Wait, I'm mixing up the Clapeyron and Clausius forms. Let me double-check. The Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = (h_lv) / (T (v_g - v_f)). Integrating this gives the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. If I assume that h_lv is constant and v_g and v_f don't change much with temperature, which is not strictly true, but perhaps acceptable for small temperature ranges, then I can integrate.

So, integrating, ln(P2/P1) = (h_lv / (R)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (v_g - v_f). Wait, but I'm not sure about the R here. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is ln(P2/P1) = [h_lv (1/T1 - 1/T2)] / [R (v_g - v_f)].

Wait, I think I'm getting the terms mixed up. Let me think again. The Clapeyron equation in differential form is dP/dT = (h_lv) / (T (v_g - v_f)). To integrate this from T1 to T2 and P1 to P2, assuming that h_lv and (v_g - v_f) are constant, we can write:

∫(dP/P) = ∫ [h_lv / (T (v_g - v_f))] dT

Which gives ln(P2/P1) = [h_lv / (v_g - v_f)] * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / 1

Wait, no R in this version. But wait, where does R come into play? Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the correct form is:

ln(P2/P1) = [h_lv (1/T1 - 1/T2)] / (R (v_g - v_f)).

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the exact form, but since I can't, I have to think carefully.

Another approach: The specific gas constant R for water vapor is R = R_universal / M, where M is molar mass. For water, M is 18.015 g/mol, so R = 10.7316 (ft·lbf)/(lbmol·R). Wait, but in the units here, the enthalpy is in Btu per lbm. So perhaps I should convert units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this using the ideal gas law for the vapor phase. But that's an approximation, and not as accurate as using the Clapeyron equation.

Wait, another thought: At the boiling point, the pressure is the saturation pressure for that temperature. So perhaps if I can find the saturation pressure at 225°F, that's the answer. But without a steam table, I have to calculate it.

So let's go back to the Clapeyron approach. The Clapeyron equation is:

dP/dT = (h_lv) / [T (v_g - v_f)]

Assuming that h_lv, v_g, and v_f are approximately constant over the temperature range from 212°F to 225°F, I can approximate the change in pressure as:

P2 = P1 + (h_lv / [T_avg (v_g - v_f)]) * (T2 - T1)

But wait, T_avg would be somewhere between T1 and T2, but perhaps I can calculate the average. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the integrated form:

ln(P2/P1) = (h_lv / (v_g - v_f)) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1)

Wait, but I think I'm missing a factor involving R here. Alternatively, perhaps the correct equation is:

ln(P2/P1) = (h_lv / (R)) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (v_g - v_f)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right dimensionally because the units wouldn't match.

Wait, perhaps I should consider units. The enthalpy of vaporization h_lv is given in Btu/lbm. Let me convert that to consistent units.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the ideal gas equation for the vapor. So, for an ideal gas, P = nRT/V. But for a specific volume v (v = V/m), so P = (n/m) R T / v. Since n/m is 1/molar mass, but I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the equation for enthalpy of vaporization in terms of P and T. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the correct form of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is:

ln(P2/P1) = (h_lv / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (1)

But that would be if we're treating the vapor as an ideal gas, and R is the specific gas constant for water vapor.

Wait, R for water vapor is R = R_universal / M, where R_universal is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R), and M is the molecular weight of water, 18.015 lbmol/lbmole.

So R = 10.7316 / 18.015 ≈ 0.5957 psi·ft³/(lbm·R).

Wait, let me compute that:

10.7316 / 18.015 = approximately 0.5957 psi·ft³/(lbm·R).

So now, h_lv is 970.3 Btu/lbm. Wait, but I need to convert this into consistent units. Because R is in (psi·ft³)/(lbm·R), and h_lv is in Btu/lbm. So I need to convert Btu to ft·lbf.

I remember that 1 Btu is approximately 778.169 ft·lbf. So h_lv = 970.3 Btu/lbm * 778.169 ft·lbf/Btu = 970.3 * 778.169 ≈ let's calculate that.

970.3 * 778 = let's approximate.

Well, 970 * 700 = 679,000.

970 * 78 = 75,660.

So total approximately 679,000 + 75,660 = 754,660 ft·lbf/lbm.

But wait, more accurately, 970.3 * 778.169 = Let's compute:

970 * 778 = let me compute 1000*778=778,000, subtract 30*778=23,340 → 778,000-23,340=754,660.

Then 0.3 *778.169≈233.45. So total h_lv ≈754,660 + 233.45 = 754,893.45 ft·lbf/lbm.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should keep more precise numbers.

Wait, 970.3 * 778.169 = ?

Well, 970 * 778.169 = 970 * 700 = 679,000; 970 * 78.169 = ?

970 * 70 = 67,900.

970 * 8.169 = approx 970 *8=7,760; 970*0.169≈164. So total 7,760 + 164=7,924.

So 67,900 +7,924=75,824.

So 679,000 +75,824=754,824.

Then 0.3 *778.169=233.45.

So total h_lv=754,824 +233.45=754,057.45 ft·lbf/lbm.

Wait, but that seems high. Let me confirm:

1 Btu = 778.169 ft·lbf.

So 970.3 Btu/lbm = 970.3 * 778.169 ft·lbf/lbm = Let me compute 970 *778.169 first.

But perhaps a calculator would help, but since I'm doing this mentally, let's proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should proceed with the equation.

So, using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P2/P1) = (h_lv / R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (v_g - v_f)

Wait, no, perhaps the correct form is:

ln(P2/P1) = (h_lv) / (R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2) / (v_g - v_f)

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the exact form. Maybe another approach: the change in pressure can be estimated using the enthalpy of vaporization and the specific volume change.

Wait, perhaps using the approximation that for a small temperature change, the pressure change can be found by:

P2 - P1 ≈ (h_lv / (T1 (v_g - v_f))) * (T2 - T1)

Wait, let me try that. So:

P2 = P1 + (h_lv / (T1 (v_g - v_f))) * (T2 - T1)

But wait, the units have to match. Let's check the units.

h_lv is in Btu/lbm. Let's convert that to ft·lbf/lbm as before.

h_lv = 970.3 Btu/lbm * 778.169 ft·lbf/Btu = 754,057 ft·lbf/lbm.

v_g - v_f = 26.80 - 0.01672 = 26.78328 ft³/lbm.

T1 is 212°F = 680.67 °R.

So putting the numbers in:

P2 = 14.7 psi + (754057 ft·lbf/lbm) / (680.67 °R * 26.78328 ft³/lbm) ) * (225°F - 212°F)

Wait, 225-212=13°F. Let's compute the term.

First, compute the denominator: 680.67 * 26.78328 ≈ 680.67 *26.78 ≈ let's compute 680 *26=17,680, 680*0.78≈531. So 17,680 +531=18,211. But wait, 680.67 *26.78328 is more accurately calculated as:

Compute 680 *26.78 = 680*26=17,680; 680*0.78= 531.84. So 17,680 +531.84=18,211.84.

Then, 0.67 *26.78 ≈ 17.92. So total denominator ≈18,211.84 +17.92≈18,229.76 (ft·lbf·lbm/(psi·ft³))?

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused with the units. Let's see:

h_lv is in ft·lbf/lbm.

v_g -v_f is in ft³/lbm.

T is in °R.

So (h_lv) / (T (v_g -v_f)) ) → (ft·lbf/lbm) / ( (°R)(ft³/lbm) ) ) → (ft·lbf) / (°R * ft³) )

But pressure is in psi, which is lbf/in². So perhaps I need to adjust units.

Wait, 1 ft = 12 inches, so 1 ft² = 144 in². So 1 lbf/ft² = 1/144 lbf/in² = 0.00694 psi.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the term (h_lv)/(T (v_g -v_f)) and then multiply by the temperature difference in °R.

Wait, but let's proceed numerically.

So:

h_lv = 754,057 ft·lbf/lbm

v_g -v_f = 26.78328 ft³/lbm

T1 = 680.67 °R

So the term (h_lv)/(T1*(v_g -v_f)) )= 754057 / (680.67 * 26.78328)

Compute denominator: 680.67 *26.78328 ≈ 18,229.7 (approx as before).

So 754057 / 18,229.7 ≈ let's see. 18,229.7 *41 = 747,398.7 (since 18,229.7 *40=729,188; +18,229.7= 747,417.7). So 41 gives us about 747k, and 754,057 -747,417.7=6,639.3 left.

So 6,639.3 /18,229.7≈0.364.

So total is ≈41.364.

So (h_lv)/(T1*(v_g -v_f))) ≈41.364 (units?)

Wait, let me see the units again. If h_lv is ft·lbf/lbm, and denominator is (°R * ft³/lbm), then overall units are (ft·lbf/lbm) / ( °R * ft³/lbm ) ) = ft·lbf/(°R * ft³) ) = (lbf/(ft²)) / °R * ft → because ft·lbf/ft³ is lbf/(ft²).

Wait, ft·lbf/ft³ = (lbf·ft)/(ft³) )= lbf/(ft²). So the term is (lbf/(ft²)) / °R = (lbf/(ft²·°R)).

But when we multiply by delta_T (in °R), the °R cancels, leaving lbf/ft².

So the term (h_lv)/(T1*(v_g -v_f))) * delta_T gives us lbf/ft², which is pressure. Since 1 lbf/ft² is 0.006944 psi (because 1 ft²=144 in², and 1 psi=1 lbf/in²= 144 lbf/ft²), so 1 lbf/ft²=1/144 psi ≈0.006944 psi.

So putting it all together:

delta_P = (h_lv / (T1 (v_g -v_f))) * delta_T

= 41.364 (lbf/ft²/°R) * 13 °R (since delta_T =13°F=13 °R)
