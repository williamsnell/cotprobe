Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked. 

The problem is an initial value problem for a second-order differential equation. The equation is y'' + γ y' + y = k δ(t-1), with initial conditions y(0)=0 and y'(0)=0. Here, γ is the damping coefficient, and k is the magnitude of an impulse at t=1. The specific task is to find the value of k, called k₁, such that the response (the solution y(t)) has a peak value of 2. 

The given value for γ is 1/2. So, I need to solve this differential equation under these conditions and find k₁. 

Alright, let's start by recalling that this is a linear second-order ODE with constant coefficients. The right-hand side is a Dirac delta function, which makes it an impulse response problem. The delta function is δ(t-1), meaning the impulse occurs at t=1. 

So, the homogeneous equation is y'' + (1/2) y' + y = 0. To solve this, I can find the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation would be r² + (1/2)r + 1 = 0. Let me solve for r:

r = [- (1/2) ± sqrt( (1/2)^2 - 4*1*1 ) ] / (2*1)
= [ -1/2 ± sqrt(1/4 - 4) ] / 2
= [ -1/2 ± sqrt(-15/4) ] / 2
= [ -1/2 ± (i sqrt(15)/2) ] / 2
= [ -1 ± i sqrt(15) ] / 4

So the roots are complex: r = (-1 ± i√15)/4. This means the homogeneous solution will be underdamped, involving exponential decay multiplied by sine and cosine functions.

The homogeneous solution is then:
y_h(t) = e^(-t/4) [ C1 cos( (√15 t)/4 ) + C2 sin( (√15 t)/4 ) ]

But since the nonhomogeneous term is a delta function, we should use the Laplace transform method to find the particular solution. 

Taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation:

L{y''} + γ L{y'} + L{y} = L{ k δ(t-1) }

The Laplace transforms are:
L{y''} = s² Y(s) - s y(0) - y'(0)
L{y'} = s Y(s) - y(0)
L{y} = Y(s)
L{δ(t-1)} = e^{-s}

Plugging in the initial conditions (both zero), this simplifies to:
(s² + γ s + 1) Y(s) = k e^{-s}

Solving for Y(s):
Y(s) = (k e^{-s}) / (s² + γ s + 1 )

Now, to find y(t), we need to inverse Laplace transform Y(s). Let's break Y(s) into two parts: e^{-s} multiplied by the transfer function.

The transfer function H(s) is 1/(s² + γ s + 1). So Y(s) = k e^{-s} H(s).

The inverse Laplace transform of H(s) is the impulse response of the system. Let me compute h(t) = L^{-1}{H(s)}.

H(s) = 1/(s² + (1/2)s +1). The denominator can be written as (s + a)^2 + ω_d^2, where a is the damping term divided by 2, and ω_d is the damped natural frequency.

Wait, actually, the denominator is s² + (1/2)s +1. To complete the square, s² + (1/2)s = (s + 1/4)^2 - (1/4)^2. So,

H(s) = 1/[ (s + 1/4)^2 + (sqrt(1 - (1/4)^2 ))^2 ) ]

Wait, let me compute the squares correctly. The standard form for underdamped systems is s² + 2 ζ ω_n s + ω_n². Comparing to our denominator, which is s² + (1/2)s + 1.

So 2 ζ ω_n = 1/2 → ζ = (1/2)/(2 ω_n) ) → but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, let's find the damped frequency.

The characteristic equation is r² + (1/2) r +1 =0, whose roots are complex as I found earlier. The damped natural frequency ω_d is sqrt( (4)^2 - 1^2 ) /4? Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, in the denominator s² + γ s +1, the natural frequency is sqrt(1) =1, but with damping, so the damped frequency is sqrt(1 - (γ/(2))² ). Wait, let me think again.

The standard form is H(s) = ω_n²/(s² + 2 ζ ω_n s + ω_n²). But our H(s) is 1/(s² + (1/2) s + 1). So comparing, ω_n² =1 → ω_n=1. 2 ζ ω_n = 1/2 → ζ= (1/2)/(2*1) )= 1/4. So the damping ratio ζ is 1/4.

So the damped natural frequency ω_d is ω_n sqrt(1 - ζ² ) = sqrt(1 - (1/4)^2 ) = sqrt(15/16) )= sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

Wait, that's the ω_d. So the inverse Laplace transform of H(s) is the impulse response h(t) = (ω_d / ζ) e^(-ζ ω_n t) sin(ω_d t). Wait, no, h(t) is usually (ω_d) e^{-ζ ω_n t} sin(ω_d t) multiplied by 1/(ω_n (1 - ζ² )^(1/2)) ), but perhaps I should double-check.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the inverse Laplace transform by expressing H(s) in terms of known transforms.

H(s) can be written as [1/( (s + a)^2 + b^2 ) ], where a=1/4 and b^2= (sqrt(15)/4 )^2 → Wait, let me compute the denominator as (s + 1/4)^2 + (sqrt(15)/4 )^2.

So H(s) = 1 / [ (s + 1/4 )^2 + (sqrt(15)/4 )^2 ].

The inverse Laplace transform of 1/( (s + a)^2 + b^2 ) is e^{-a t} sin(b t) / b.

So h(t) = L^{-1} { H(s) } = [ e^{ - (1/4) t } sin( (sqrt(15)/4 ) t ) ] / ( sqrt(15)/4 ) )

Simplify that: 4/sqrt(15) * e^{-t/4} sin( (sqrt(15)/4 ) t )

So h(t) = (4 / sqrt(15)) e^{ -t/4 } sin( (sqrt(15)/4 ) t )

But wait, our Y(s) is (k e^{-s} ) H(s), so the inverse Laplace transform is k times the time-shifted h(t-1). So y(t) = k * h(t-1) * u(t-1), where u(t) is the unit step function.

So, y(t) = k * (4 / sqrt(15)) e^{ -(t-1)/4 } sin( (sqrt(15)/4 )(t-1) ) * u(t-1)

Thus, for t ≥1, the solution is y(t)= (4k / sqrt(15)) e^{ -(t-1)/4 } sin( (sqrt(15)/4)(t-1) )

Now, we need to find the peak value of this response. The peak occurs when the sine term reaches its maximum, which is 1. But wait, the exponential term is also a function of time. So the maximum of y(t) occurs when the derivative dy/dt is zero.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to express y(t) in terms of an exponentially decaying envelope and find when this envelope multiplied by sine leads to the maximum. 

Wait, but the maximum of y(t) would occur at the first peak of the sinusoid, considering the exponential decay. Let's see.

Let me set τ = t-1. So for t ≥1, y(t) = A e^{-τ/4} sin(ω τ ), where A=4k/sqrt(15), ω = sqrt(15)/4.

The maximum of y(t) occurs when the derivative with respect to τ is zero. So let's find dy/dτ and set it to zero.

dy/dτ = A [ (-1/4) e^{-τ/4} sin(ω τ ) + e^{-τ/4} ω cos(ω τ ) ]

Set dy/dτ = 0:

(-1/4) sin(ω τ ) + ω cos(ω τ ) = 0

=> (ω) cos(ω τ ) = (1/4) sin(ω τ )

Divide both sides by cos(ω τ ), assuming cos(ω τ ) ≠0:

ω = (1/4) tan(ω τ )

Let me denote θ = ω τ. Then:

tan θ = 4 ω.

Wait, ω is sqrt(15)/4. So:

tan θ = 4 * (sqrt(15)/4 ) = sqrt(15)

So θ = arctan( sqrt(15) )

Compute arctan( sqrt(15) ). Let's see, sqrt(15) is approximately 3.87298. Arctan(3.87298) is an angle in the first quadrant. Let me compute this in radians.

But wait, wait. Let me compute tan θ = sqrt(15). So θ is the angle whose tangent is sqrt(15). Let's compute θ.

We can compute tan θ = sqrt(15) ≈3.87298. So θ is approx 1.3181 radians. Because tan(1.3181) ≈ tan(75.522 degrees) ≈3.732, wait, that's not right. Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: tan(π/2) is infinity. So tan(1.308) is tan(75 degrees) is 2 + sqrt(3) ≈3.732. Hmm, but sqrt(15) is about 3.872. So the angle should be a little more than 1.308 radians (75 degrees). Let me compute numerically.

Let me compute θ where tanθ = sqrt(15)=3.872983346...

Using a calculator, tan(1.310 radians) is approx:

1.310 radians is about 75.1 degrees. Let me compute tan(1.31):

Using a calculator: 

tan(1.31) ≈ 3.902.

Wait, that's very close to sqrt(15) ≈3.87298. Hmm, maybe I'll need to compute this more accurately, but perhaps I can use calculus. Alternatively, perhaps I can express θ as some exact expression.

Wait, perhaps there's a better approach. Let me think about the maximum of y(τ). The function is y(τ) = A e^{-τ/4} sin( ω τ )

The maximum occurs when the derivative is zero, which is when:

tan(ω τ) = 4 ω

As I had earlier. So, θ = ω τ = arctan(4 ω )

Wait, because ω is sqrt(15)/4, so 4 ω is sqrt(15). So,

θ = arctan( sqrt(15) )

Which is a specific angle. Let me compute this angle.

We know that tan(theta) = sqrt(15) → opposite = sqrt(15), adjacent =1 → hypotenuse = sqrt(1 +15) =4. So theta is arcsin( sqrt(15)/4 ), or arccos(1/4).

Because in a right triangle with opposite side sqrt(15), adjacent 1, hypotenuse 4. So theta can be expressed as arcsin( sqrt(15)/4 ), which is approximately 1.318 radians (since sin(1.318) ≈ sqrt(15)/4 ≈0.9682).

Wait, yes. Because sin(theta) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈0.9682, so theta ≈1.318 radians.

So, the time τ at which the maximum occurs is τ = theta / omega.

omega = sqrt(15)/4, so tau = theta * 4 / sqrt(15).

But theta is arctan( sqrt(15) ), which is also arcsin( sqrt(15)/4 ), as I just found. So, let me compute tau.

tau = (theta) / (sqrt(15)/4) ) = (4 theta ) / sqrt(15)

But theta = arctan( sqrt(15) ), which is arctan( (sqrt(15)/1) ). So, theta is the angle I discussed earlier.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express tau in terms of theta. So, tau is theta *4 / sqrt(15).

But theta is arctan(sqrt(15)), so I can express tau as:

tau = (4 * arctan( sqrt(15) )) / sqrt(15)

But perhaps I can compute this numerically.

Compute sqrt(15)=3.872983.

arctan(3.872983) ≈ 1.3181 radians.

So tau ≈ (4 * 1.3181 ) / 3.87298 ≈ (5.2724) /3.87298 ≈1.3618 seconds.

So, the time when the maximum occurs is t = 1 + tau ≈1 + 1.3618 ≈2.3618 seconds.

Now, the maximum value of y(t) is y_max = A e^{-tau/4} sin(theta)

But since theta is the angle where sin(theta)=sqrt(15)/4, as I found earlier. Wait, because in the triangle, opposite is sqrt(15), hypotenuse is4, so sin(theta)=sqrt(15)/4.

So, sin(theta)=sqrt(15)/4 ≈0.9682.

So, y_max = A * e^(-tau/4) * sin(theta) 

But A =4k / sqrt(15), and tau is 1.3618. So,

y_max = (4k / sqrt(15)) * e^(-1.3618/4) * (sqrt(15)/4 )

Simplify this:

The 4 cancels with the 4 in the denominator, and sqrt(15) cancels with 1/sqrt(15). So,

y_max = k * e^(-1.3618/4) * 1.

So, y_max =k * e^(-0.34045).

Compute e^(-0.34045) ≈ e^{-0.34045}.

Compute 0.34045: e^{-0.34045} ≈1/(e^{0.34045}). Let me compute e^{0.34045}.

e^0.3≈1.34986, e^0.34≈ 1.4049, e^0.34045≈ about 1.4055.

So, e^{-0.34045} ≈1/1.4055≈0.7112.

So, y_max ≈k *0.7112.

But the problem states that the peak value is 2. So,

2 = k * 0.7112 → k=2 /0.7112≈2.811.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.8108, which matches this value.

So, the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the given initial value problem:

$$
y'' + \gamma y' + y = k \delta(t-1), \quad y(0)=0, \quad y'(0)=0,
$$

where $\gamma = \frac{1}{2}$ and $k$ is the magnitude of an impulse at $t=1$, we aim to find $k_1$ such that the response $y(t)$ has a peak value of 2.

### Step 1: Solve the Homogeneous Equation
The homogeneous equation is:

$$
y'' + \frac{1}{2} y' + y = 0.
$$

The characteristic equation is:

$$
r^2 + \frac{1}{2}r + 1 = 0.
$$

Solving for $r$:

$$
r = \frac{-\frac{1}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2(1)} = \frac{-\frac{1}{2} \pm i\sqrt{\frac{15}{4}}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{15}}{4}.
$$

The roots are complex, indicating underdamped oscillations. The homogeneous solution is:

$$
y_h(t) = e^{-t/4} \left[C_1 \cos\left(\frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}t\right) + C_2 \sin\left(\frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}t\right)\right].
$$

### Step 2: Solve the Nonhomogeneous Equation
The nonhomogeneous term is $k \delta(t-1)$. Using the Laplace transform, the solution is:

$$
Y(s) = \frac{k e^{-s}}{s^2 + \frac{1}{2}s + 1}.
$$

The inverse Laplace transform of $Y(s)$ is:

$$
y(t) = k h(t-1) u(t-1),
$$

where $h(t)$ is the impulse response of the system. For $t \geq 1$, the response is:

$$
y(t) = \frac{4k}{\sqrt{15}} e^{-(t-1)/4} \sin\left(\frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}(t-1)\right).
$$

### Step 3: Find the Peak Value
The peak value of $y(t)$ occurs when the sine term reaches its maximum value of 1, and the exponential term is at its maximum. Let $\tau = t-1$. The response becomes:

$$
y(\tau) = \frac{4k}{\sqrt{15}} e^{-\tau/4} \sin\left(\frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}\tau\right).
$$

The peak
