Question:

In year 6, an IRS agent completed an examination of a corporation’s year 5 tax return and proposed an adjustment that will result in an increase in taxable income for each of years 1 through year 5. All returns were filed on the original due date. The proposed adjustment relates to the disallowance of corporate jet usage for personal reasons. The agent does not find the error to be fraudulent or substantial in nature. Which of the following statements regarding this adjustment is correct?

Options:

A: The adjustment is improper because the statute of limitations has expired for several years of the adjustment
B: The adjustment is improper because the agent did not find the error to be fraudulent or substantial in nature.
C: The adjustment is proper because it relates to the disallowance of personal usage of a corporate jet.
D: The adjustment is improper because an agent may only propose adjustments to the year under examination.
E: The adjustment is improper because the corporation had already filed their tax returns.
F: The adjustment is improper because the IRS agent is not authorized to propose such adjustments.
G: The adjustment is proper because there is no statute of limitations for improperly claiming personal expenses as business expenses
H: The adjustment is proper because it is within the agent’s discretion to propose adjustments for any year.
I: The adjustment is proper because it relates to a change in accounting method, which can be made retroactively irrespective of the statute of limitations.

Okay, so I've got this tax question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully.

The situation is about an IRS agent who examined a corporation's year 5 tax return and found an adjustment that increases taxable income for years 1 through 5. The adjustment is because they disallowed corporate jet usage for personal reasons. The agent didn't find any fraud or substantial error. The question is about which statement is correct regarding this adjustment.

Hmm, I remember that the statute of limitations is a big factor in tax audits. Generally, the IRS has three years from the filing date to assess additional taxes. Since all returns were filed on the original due date, the statute should start from that point.

Wait, but the agent is looking at year 5 and proposing changes for years 1-5. So, each year's return was filed on time. Year 1's return was due, say, April of year 2, right? So the statute would have run three years from then, making it expired for year 1, 2, 3, and maybe 4, depending on when the agent is doing this.

But wait, the adjustment relates to the disallowance of personal expenses. I think there are exceptions to the statute of limitations. One is if the error is due to fraud, but the agent didn't find any fraud here. Another exception is for substantial errors, but the agent didn't find that either. So those exceptions don't apply.

Is there any other reason the statute wouldn't apply? Oh, wait, I remember something about certain items that aren't properly reported. Like if a taxpayer doesn't report income or claims deductions they aren't entitled to. But in this case, the corporation claimed a business deduction for the jet usage, but the agent says it's personal, so it's disallowed. That might be a different situation.

Wait, another point: the agent is examining year 5 and making adjustments to years prior. Normally, once the statute has run on an earlier year, the IRS can't assess additional taxes for that year. So for years 1-3, the statute would have expired. Year 4 might still be within the three years if the examination started late enough. Year 5 is definitely within the statute period.

So if the agent proposes adjustments for years 1-5, but the statute has expired for years 1-3, then those adjustments would be improper because the IRS can't assess those years anymore. So the adjustment is improper for the expired years.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the adjustment is improper because the statute has expired for several years. That seems correct based on what I was thinking.

Option B says it's improper because the error isn't fraudulent or substantial. I think that relates to the exception for substantial errors, but if the statute is already expired, then B might be a reason, but I'm not sure. Wait, the normal statute applies unless an exception is met. Since the agent didn't find fraud or substantial error, the exceptions don't apply, so the statute of limitations would bar adjustments for years beyond three years.

Option C says the adjustment is proper because it's disallowance of personal usage. But the timing (statute) is the main issue here, so even if the adjustment is correct in substance, the IRS can't make it if the statute has run.

Option D says the adjustment is improper because agents can only propose adjustments to the year under examination. I don't think that's right. I remember that sometimes adjustments can be made to other years if there's an open statute, but if the statute is closed, then they can't.

Option E: improper because the returns were filed. No, filing doesn't prevent adjustments; that's what audits are for.

Option F: improper because the agent isn't authorized. I don't think that's correct. Agents are authorized to propose adjustments within the statute period.

Option G: proper because no statute for personal expenses as business. I don't think that's a thing. The general statute applies unless exceptions, which don't apply here.

Option H: proper because agent can propose any year. No, because statute of limitations restricts that.

Option I: proper because it's a change in accounting method. The question doesn't say anything about accounting methods, so this is irrelevant.

So the correct answer should be A: improper because the statute has expired for several years.

The correct answer is:

**A: The adjustment is improper because the statute of limitations has expired for several years of the adjustment.**

The IRS generally has three years from the filing date of a tax return to assess additional taxes, and this statute of limitations applies unless specific exceptions (such as fraud or substantial error) are present. In this case, the agent did not find fraud or substantial error, so the exceptions do not apply. Since the adjustment proposes changes to years 1 through 5 and the statute of limitations has likely expired for years 1-3, the IRS cannot properly assess adjustments for those years. Therefore, the adjustment is improper for the expired years.
