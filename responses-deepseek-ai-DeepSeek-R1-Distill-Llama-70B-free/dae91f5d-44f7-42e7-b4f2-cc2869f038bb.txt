Okay, so I'm trying to solve this tax question about gifts and stock sales. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

So, Simmons gave her child some publicly traded stock. The basis is $40,000, but the fair market value is $30,000. I remember that when you give a gift, the tax basis of the asset can change depending on whether it's a gain or loss situation. 

Wait, the basis for the donor is $40k, and the FMV at the time of the gift is $30k. So, since the FMV is lower than the basis, this is a loss situation. But when gifting, if the asset has decreased in value, the donee (the child here) takes the donor's basis, right? Or is it the other way around?

No, wait. I think when you gift an asset, the donee's basis is the same as the donor's basis. So, if Simmons had a basis of $40k, and the child receives the stock as a gift, the child's basis becomes $40k, regardless of the FMV at the time of the gift.

So, the child later sells the stock for $36k. The sale price is $36k, and the basis is $40k. So, the child's gain or loss would be the selling price minus the basis.

Let me calculate that. 36,000 minus 40,000 is -4,000. So that's a $4,000 loss. But wait, can you have a loss on a sale if the asset was a gift?

I recall that when you sell a gift, the basis is the donor's basis, but if the FMV at the time of the gift was lower than the basis, then the donee's basis is actually the FMV when it's a loss situation. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Oh wait, the rule is: if the asset is a gift, and the donee sells it, the basis is the donor's adjusted basis at the time of the gift, except when the donee sells it at a loss. In that case, the donee's basis is the lesser of the donor's basis or the FMV at the time of the gift.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing this up. Let me get this straight. Generally, for gifts, the donee's basis is the donor's basis, which is known as a carryover basis. However, if the donee sells the asset and realizes a loss, the basis is the lesser of the donor's basis or the FMV at the time of the gift.

Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. For determining loss, the basis is the lesser of the donor's basis or the FMV at the time of the gift. So, if the donor's basis is higher than the FMV, and the donee sells it for a lower price, then the basis for loss purposes is the FMV.

But in this case, the donee sells it for $36k, which is higher than the FMV of $30k but lower than the donor's basis of $40k.

So, let's apply this: the child's basis when calculating loss would be the FMV at the time of the gift ($30k) because that's lower than the donor's basis, and the sale results in a loss if sold below the basis. But wait, in this case, the sale is $36k, which is higher than $30k but lower than $40k.

Wait, no, the sale is $36k. The basis for the child is either $40k (donor's basis) or $30k (FMV at gift). So which one applies here?

I think the rule is that when the donee sells the asset, if it's sold for a gain, the basis is the donor's basis. If it's sold for a loss, the basis is the FMV at the time of the gift.

Wait, no. Let me look up the rule. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I'm trying to remember. So, the donee's basis is the donor's basis, but if the donee sells it and incurs a loss, the basis is the lesser of the donor's basis or the FMV at the time of the gift.

Wait, no. Maybe it's that the donee's basis is the donor's basis, but when calculating a loss, the basis can't exceed the FMV at the time of the gift. So, the loss is limited to the FMV.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe an example would help.

Scenario: Donor's basis is $40k, FMV at gift is $30k. Child sells for $36k.

If the child's basis is $40k, then selling for $36k would be a $4k loss. But since the FMV was $30k, perhaps the loss is limited to the difference between the sale price and the FMV? No, that doesn't make sense because the sale is higher than the FMV.

Wait, perhaps the basis for the child is the FMV when the asset is sold for a loss. So, when the sale is for a loss, the basis is the FMV at the time of the gift.

Wait, but in this case, selling for $36k is not a loss compared to the FMV of $30k. Because 36k is higher than 30k. So, wait, in this case, the child's basis would still be $40k.

Because the sale is $36k, which is less than $40k, so it's a loss of $4k. But wait, but the FMV was lower than the basis. So, maybe the loss is calculated using the FMV as the basis. So, the loss would be 36k - 30k = 6k gain? No, that can't be.

Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The general rule is that when you receive a gift, your basis is the donor's basis (carryover) if you sell it for a gain. If you sell it for a loss, your basis is the FMV at the time of the gift.

So, in this case, the child sells for 36k, which is between the FMV (30k) and the donor's basis (40k). So, the sale is a loss because 36k < 40k. Therefore, the basis used is the FMV of 30k.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the sale is higher than FMV, so it's a gain relative to FMV but a loss relative to the donor's basis.

So, the rule is: if the donee sells the asset for more than the FMV at the time of the gift, the basis is the donor's basis, and any gain is calculated from there. If sold for less than FMV, then the basis is the FMV.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to outline the rules.

When a gift is made, the donee's basis is:

- If the asset is sold for a gain (sale price > donor's basis), then donee's basis is donor's basis.

- If the asset is sold for a loss (sale price < FMV at gift time), then donee's basis is FMV at gift.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct rule is that the donee's basis is the donor's basis, but if the asset is sold at a loss, the loss is limited to the difference between the sale price and the FMV at the time of the gift.

Wait, no, that's not how it works. Another approach: the donee's basis is the donor's basis. But if the donee sells the asset, and the sale price is less than the FMV at the time of the gift, then the loss is the sale price minus the FMV. But if the sale price is between FMV and donor's basis, then the loss is based on the donor's basis.

Wait, that can't be right either. Let me think of an example.

Suppose donor's basis is 50, FMV is 30. Donee sells for 40. So, the sale is higher than FMV (30) but lower than donor's basis (50). So, is it a loss?

In terms of the donor's basis, yes, 40 is less than 50, so a loss of 10. But in terms of FMV, it's a gain of 10.

But according to the tax rules, I think when the donee sells the asset, the basis for calculating loss is the lesser of the donor's basis or the FMV at the time of the gift. So, if the donee sells it for 40, which is less than donor's basis (50) but higher than FMV (30), then the loss is calculated as 40 - 30 = 10 gain? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, perhaps the basis is the donor's basis unless the sale is below the FMV. Then, the basis becomes the FMV.

But in our case, the sale is 36k, which is higher than the FMV (30k), so the basis remains the donor's basis (40k). Therefore, the loss is 36k - 40k = -4k, which is a $4k loss.

But wait, is there a rule that when the sale is between FMV and donor's basis, the donee can only recognize a loss up to the FMV?

No, I think the donee's basis is the donor's basis, and the sale is 36k, which is less than 40k, so the loss is 4k.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Because some sources say that when you receive a gift and sell it, if you sell it at a loss, your basis is the lesser of the donor's basis or the FMV at the time of the gift.

So, in this case, the sale is $36k. The donor's basis is $40k. FMV at gift was $30k.

Since the sale is less than donor's basis, the basis becomes the FMV, which is 30k.

So, the loss would be 36k -30k = +6k, which is a gain. Wait, that can't be right because 36k is higher than 30k.

Wait, no. If the basis is the FMV, then the loss is calculated as sale price minus basis. So, 36k minus 30k is 6k, which is a gain, but that's not possible because the sale is less than the donor's basis.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think about how the loss is calculated.

When the donee sells the asset, the recognized loss is the lesser of (sale price minus donor's basis) or (sale price minus FMV at gift). Or is it that the basis is the donor's basis, but if the sale is below FMV, then the basis is FMV?

I think the correct rule is: when the donee sells the asset, the basis is the donor's basis, but if the sale price is less than the FMV at the time of the gift, then the basis is the FMV. So, the loss is the sale price minus the FMV.

Wait, that can't be right because in our case, the sale is higher than the FMV, so the basis remains the donor's basis, and the loss is 36k -40k = -4k, a $4k loss.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about it again.

Another approach: gifts. The donee's basis is generally the donor's basis. However, if the donee sells the asset at a loss, the basis is the lesser of the donor's basis or the FMV at the time of the gift.

So, in this case, the donee sells for 36k. The donor's basis is 40k, FMV at gift was 30k.

So, since the sale is 36k, which is less than donor's basis (40k), the donee has a loss. The basis for calculating the loss is the FMV, which is 30k.

Therefore, the loss is 36k -30k = 6k. But wait, that would be a gain because 36k >30k.

Wait, no, that can't be right. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify.

The rule is: when a gift is made and the donee sells the asset, the donee's basis is the donor's basis. However, if the asset is sold at a loss, the basis is the lesser of the donor's basis or the FMV at the time of the gift.

So, the donee's basis is 40k. The sale is 36k, which is less than 40k, so it's a loss. But because it's a loss, the basis is the lesser of 40k and 30k, which is 30k.

Therefore, the loss is 36k -30k = 6k. Wait, but that's a gain of 6k, not a loss. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, because 36k is the sale price. If the basis is 30k, then 36k -30k = 6k gain. But that's contradictory because the sale was below the donor's basis.

Alternatively, maybe the loss is the sale price minus the FMV, but only if the sale is below the FMV.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find a simpler approach.

In general, when you receive a gift, your basis is the donor's basis. But when you sell the gift, if the sale price is less than the donor's basis, your basis becomes the FMV at the time of the gift. So, the loss is calculated as the sale price minus the FMV.

Wait, but in our case, the sale is 36k, which is higher than the FMV (30k), so the loss would be 40k -36k = 4k, using the donor's basis.

But if the sale was less than the FMV, say 25k, then the loss would be 25k -30k = -5k, which is a 5k loss, but that's impossible because 25k is less than 30k. Wait, that's a loss of 5k.

Wait, no. If the sale is 25k, and the basis is 30k, then the loss is 5k.

But perhaps the correct approach is: when the donee sells the asset, the basis is the donor's basis, unless the sale price is less than the FMV at the time of the gift, in which case the basis is the FMV.

So, in our case, the sale is 36k, which is greater than the FMV (30k), so the basis remains the donor's basis (40k). Therefore, the loss is 36k -40k = -4k, which is a $4k loss.

But wait, the child's recognized gain or loss is the difference between the sale price and their basis. So, 36k -40k = -4k, so $4k loss.

But wait, when the FMV is lower than the donor's basis, and the donee sells it for a price between the two, the basis remains the donor's basis. So, the loss is 4k.

But I also recall that in such cases, the donee can't have a loss exceeding the difference between the sale price and the FMV. Hmm, but that doesn't apply here because the sale is above the FMV.

Wait, perhaps the rule is that the donee's basis is the donor's basis, but any loss is limited to the excess of the FMV over the sale price. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, the donee's basis is the donor's basis, and the recognized loss is the sale price minus the basis, regardless of FMV. So, 36k -40k = -4k, so $4k loss.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting information in my head. Maybe I should look for the correct rule.

The correct rule is: when a gift is made, the donee's basis is the donor's basis. However, if the donee sells the asset at a loss, the basis is the lesser of the donor's basis or the FMV at the time of the gift.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct rule is that the donee's basis is the donor's basis, but if the asset is sold for a loss, the loss is the sale price minus the FMV at the time of the gift, but only if the sale price is less than the FMV.

Wait, no, I think the correct rule is that when the donee sells the asset, the basis is the donor's basis, but if the sale price is less than the FMV at the time of the gift, the basis is the FMV, not the donor's basis.

Wait, that can't be, because if the sale is higher than FMV but lower than donor's basis, the basis would still be the donor's basis, leading to a loss.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find a clear answer.

Upon checking (hypothetically, because I can't look it up now), the rule is: the donee's basis in gifted property is the donor's basis. However, if the donee sells the property and the sale price is less than the FMV at the time of the gift, the donee's basis is the FMV. This means that the donee cannot recognize a loss exceeding the difference between the FMV and the sale price.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think differently.

When gifting, the donee's basis is the donor's basis. If the donee sells the asset, the gain or loss is calculated using the donee's basis (which is the donor's basis). However, if the sale price is less than the FMV at the time of the gift, the loss is limited. Specifically, the loss cannot exceed the difference between the FMV and the sale price.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct rule is that when the donee sells the asset, the basis is the donor's basis, but if the sale price is less than the FMV at the time of the gift, the basis is the sale price, leading to no loss or a smaller loss.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach it from another angle.

In this problem, the child sells the stock for $36k. The donor's basis is $40k, and the FMV at the time of the gift was $30k.

If the child's basis is the donor's basis ($40k), then the loss is $4k (36k-40k).

But I've heard that when the FMV is lower than the donor's basis, the donee's basis is the FMV for loss purposes. So, if the sale is $36k, which is higher than FMV, then the basis
