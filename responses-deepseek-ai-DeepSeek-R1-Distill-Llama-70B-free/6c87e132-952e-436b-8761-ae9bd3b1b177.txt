Question:

What is the physiological basis of allergies? What measures can be taken to decrease the effect of allergies?

Options:

A: Allergies are adverse immunological responses to antigens. Antihistamines and desensitization therapy can help decrease the effect of allergies.
B: Allergies are triggered by the body's overproduction of white blood cells. Avoiding allergens and taking vitamin supplements can decrease the effect of allergies.
C: Allergies are caused by genetic mutations and can be minimized by regular exercise and a healthy diet.
D: Allergies can be fully cured with antihistamines.
E: Allergies are caused by exposure to pathogens.
F: Allergies develop due to an overactive nervous system. Beta-blockers and nerve-calming medications can help mitigate the effects of allergies.
G: Allergies are a result of lack of immune response.
H: Allergies are psychosomatic and can be managed through stress reduction techniques and meditation.
I: Allergies result from the body's inability to produce sufficient antibodies. Immunoglobulin therapy can help decrease the effect of allergies.
J: Allergies are the body's natural response to environmental pollutants. Using air purifiers and avoiding outdoor activities can reduce allergy symptoms.

Okay, so I've got this question about the physiological basis of allergies and what measures can be taken to decrease their effects. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, what do I remember about allergies? I think they're related to the immune system. When the body reacts to something that's not harmful, like pollen or dust mites, it's an allergic reaction. So maybe it's an overreaction of the immune system?

Wait, I remember that the immune system usually protects against pathogens. But in allergies, it's reacting to allergens, which are normally harmless. So the immune system must be involved. Oh right, it's an immune response, but a specific kind. I think it's called a hypersensitivity reaction. There are different types, but the most common is probably the immediate hypersensitivity, which involves IgE antibodies.

So when an allergen enters the body, B cells produce IgE antibodies. These antibodies bind to mast cells. Then, if the allergen comes again, it binds to the IgE on the mast cells, causing them to release histamine and other chemicals. These chemicals lead to symptoms like sneezing, itching, and in severe cases, anaphylaxis.

So the physiological basis is an adverse immunological response to antigens, which are the allergens in this case. Now, the second part of the question is about measures to decrease the effects.

What do I know about treatments? Well, antihistamines are commonly used. They block the action of histamine, which reduces symptoms like runny nose or itchy eyes. Another treatment I've heard of is desensitization therapy, also known as immunotherapy. This involves gradually exposing the person to small amounts of the allergen to build up tolerance over time.

Looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A says allergies are adverse immunological responses and mentions antihistamines and desensitization. That fits with what I was thinking.

Option B says it's overproduction of white blood cells. I don't think that's right. Allergies are more about the type of immune response, not just more white cells.

Option C mentions genetic mutations. I know allergies can have a genetic component, but the main cause is the immune response, not mutations.

Option D claims allergies can be fully cured with antihistamines. No, antihistamines just manage symptoms. They don't cure allergies.

Option E says caused by exposure to pathogens. No, allergens are not pathogens, so that's incorrect.

Option F talks about an overactive nervous system. I don't think that's the case. Allergies are immune, not nervous system issues.

Option G says lack of immune response. No, it's the opposite; it's an overactive response.

Option H says psychosomatic. That's when the mind affects the body, but allergies are real immune reactions, so this isn't right.

Option I says inability to produce antibodies. No, they produce antibodies, but they're IgE which triggers the allergic response.

Option J says it's a response to environmental pollutants and suggests avoiding them. Well, avoiding allergens is a strategy, but the physiological basis here is correct only in part. The first part of J's option is wrong because it's the immune response, not just environmental pollutants.

So the correct answer should be A. It correctly identifies the immune basis and the appropriate treatments.

The physiological basis of allergies involves an overreaction of the immune system to harmless substances, such as pollen or dust mites, known as allergens. This triggers a hypersensitivity reaction, often mediated by IgE antibodies. When an allergen enters the body, it binds to these antibodies on mast cells, causing the release of histamine and other chemicals, leading to symptoms like sneezing, itching, and inflammation.

To manage allergies, antihistamines can block histamine's effects, reducing symptoms. Desensitization therapy, or immunotherapy, is another effective measure, involving gradual exposure to small amounts of the allergen to build tolerance over time.

Among the options provided, only Option A correctly identifies the immune basis of allergies and the appropriate measures to decrease their effects.

Answer: A
