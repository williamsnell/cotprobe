Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Horner's motive to avoid success. I remember that Horner studied something about women and success, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this.

The question is asking two parts: first, defining the motive according to Horner, and second, how she studied it in women. The options are A to D. 

I recall that Horner proposed the concept of the "fear of success." She noticed that some women might avoid succeeding because they think it could negatively impact their relationships. So, they might hold themselves back in their careers or intellectual pursuits to maintain emotional connections or avoid social disapproval.

Looking at the options, option A says it's about avoiding success in occupational and intellectual areas to ensure success in emotional and relational areas. That sounds right because it aligns with the idea that women might prioritize relationships over career success due to societal pressures or expectations.

Option B suggests women are less ambitious, but I don't think that's accurate. Horner's theory is more about fear of negative consequences rather than a lack of ambition.

Option C states that success leads to negative results. That's a bit too broad. It's more specific than thatâ€”fear of how success affects relationships.

Option D says success is unattainable for women, which doesn't fit. Horner's work was about the fear of achieving success, not the belief that it's impossible.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be A. It's about avoiding success in certain areas to maintain success in others, specifically emotional and relational pursuits.

The correct answer is A because Horner's theory describes the motive to avoid success in occupational and intellectual pursuits to ensure success in emotional and relational areas.
