Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says a cell is roughly spherical with a radius of 20.0e-6 meters. I need to calculate the work required to expand the cell surface against the surface tension when the radius increases by a factor of three. It also mentions that the cell is surrounded by pure water at T=298.15 K. Hmm, I guess I should remember some formulas related to surface tension and work done.

Wait, surface tension... right, surface tension (γ) is the energy required to increase the surface area. And the work done (W) against surface tension would be the change in surface area multiplied by the surface tension. So the formula should be W = γ * ΔA, where ΔA is the change in area.

But wait, does that apply here? I think so because expanding the surface against the tension requires work. So first, I need to find the initial and final surface areas.

The cell is a sphere, so the surface area (A) of a sphere is 4πr². Initially, the radius is r1 = 20e-6 m. The radius increases by a factor of three, so the new radius r2 would be 3 * 20e-6 = 60e-6 m.

So let me calculate the initial surface area A1 and the final A2.

A1 = 4π (r1)^2 = 4π (20e-6)^2
A2 = 4π (r2)^2 = 4π (60e-6)^2

The change in area ΔA is A2 - A1.

So ΔA = 4π (60e-6)^2 - 4π (20e-6)^2
I can factor out 4π (20e-6)^2 from both terms.

Wait, let's compute it numerically. Let me compute A1 and A2.

Compute A1:
20e-6 is 2e-5 m. (Wait, 20e-6 is 20 micrometers, which is 2e-5 m? Wait no, 1e-6 is a millionth, so 20e-6 is 20 micrometers, which is 2e-5? No, 20e-6 is 2e-5? Hmm, 20e-6 is 0.00002 meters, which is 2e-5 meters. Right, correct.

So A1 = 4 * π * (20e-6)^2 = 4π (4e-10) = 16πe-10 m². Wait, 20 squared is 400, so 400e-12? Because (20e-6)^2 is 400*(1e-6)^2 = 400e-12 = 4e-10. So 4π * 4e-10 = 16πe-10 m².

Similarly, A2 = 4π*(60e-6)^2. 60e-6 squared is 3600e-12, which is 3.6e-9 m². So 4π * 3.6e-9 = 14.4πe-9 m².

Wait, maybe it's easier to factor out 4π*(20e-6)^2 from ΔA. Let me try that.

ΔA = 4π (r2² - r1²) = 4π [(r2 - r1)(r2 + r1)].

r1 is 20e-6, r2 is 60e-6. So:

r2 - r1 = 40e-6 m
r2 + r1 = 80e-6 m

Multiply them: 40e-6 * 80e-6 = 3200e-12 = 3.2e-9 m².

So ΔA = 4π * 3.2e-9 = 12.8πe-9 m².

Wait, but wait, let me compute 4π*(r2² - r1²) directly.

r2 is 3 times r1, so r2 = 3r1. Thus, r2² = 9r1². So r2² - r1² = 8r1².

Thus, ΔA = 4π * 8 r1² = 32 π r1².

r1 is 20e-6 m, so r1² is 4e-10 m². So ΔA = 32π *4e-10 = 128 π e-10 m². Wait, 32 *4 is 128. So 128πe-10 m² is 1.28e-8 π m²? Wait, 128e-10 is 1.28e-8, yes.

Wait, but wait, earlier I tried another approach and got 12.8πe-9. Hmm, which one is correct?

Wait, let me compute r2² - r1². r1 is 20e-6, r2 is 60e-6.

r2² = (60e-6)^2 = 3600e-12 = 3.6e-9 m²
r1² = (20e-6)^2 = 400e-12 = 4e-10 m²
So r2² - r1² = 3.6e-9 - 0.4e-9 = 3.2e-9 m².

Then ΔA = 4π * 3.2e-9 = 12.8πe-9 m².

Yes, so that approach gives 12.8πe-9 m² as ΔA.

Wait, but when I expressed r2 as 3r1, I had r2² - r1² = 8r1² = 8*(20e-6)^2. Let's compute that:

8*(20e-6)^2 = 8*(4e-10) = 32e-10 m² = 3.2e-9 m², same as before. So 4π *3.2e-9 = 12.8e-9 * π m².

So yes, that's correct.

Now, the next part is finding the surface tension γ for water at 298.15 K. I remember that the surface tension of water decreases with temperature. At room temperature (like 25°C, which is 298.15 K), the surface tension of water is about 0.072 N/m. I think that's right. Let me double-check in my notes. Oh wait, I'm just recalling, but I think it's approximately 0.072 N/m at 25°C.

So γ is 0.072 N/m.

Now, the work done W is γ multiplied by the change in area ΔA. So W = γ * ΔA.

Wait, but wait, surface tension is in N/m, and area is in m², so N/m * m² = N*m = Joules. So the units check out.

So let me compute W.

ΔA is 12.8e-9 * π m². Let me compute that numerically.

12.8e-9 is 1.28e-8. So 1.28e-8 * π ≈ 4.02e-8 m².

Then W = γ * ΔA = 0.072 N/m * 4.02e-8 m².

Multiply 0.072 by 4.02e-8:

0.072 * 4.02e-8 = Let me compute 0.072 * 4.02 first.

0.07 *4= 0.28, 0.002 *4=0.008. 0.07*0.02=0.0014, 0.002 *0.02=0.00004. Wait, maybe a better approach: 4.02 *0.072.

4 * 0.072 = 0.288.

0.02 * 0.072 = 0.00144.

So total 0.288 + 0.00144 = 0.28944.

So 0.28944e-8 J. Which is 2.8944e-9 J.

Looking at the options, option E is 2.89e-9 J. So that's the closest value.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me recalculate the numbers more carefully.

Compute ΔA:

r1 = 20e-6 m, r2 =60e-6 m.

ΔA = 4π (r2^2 - r1^2) = 4π [(60e-6)^2 - (20e-6)^2]

Compute (60e-6)^2 = 3600e-12 = 3.6e-9 m²
(20e-6)^2 =400e-12 = 0.4e-9 m²
So difference is 3.2e-9 m².

So ΔA =4π *3.2e-9 = 12.8 π e-9 m².

Compute 12.8 * π ≈ 40.21 (Wait, wait, 12 * π is about 37.7, 0.8 * π is about 2.51, so total 40.21? Wait no, 12.8 is about 40.84 when multiplied by π? Wait, no, 12.8 * 3.1416 = let's compute:

12 *3.1416=37.6992
0.8 *3.1416=2.5133
Total: 37.6992 +2.5133=40.2125. So approximately 40.2125e-9 m²? Wait no, 12.8e-9 m² is 1.28e-8, multiplied by π gives about 4.02e-8 m². Oh wait, no, 12.8e-9 is 0.0128e-6, but no, sorry, I think I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, 12.8e-9 is 1.28e-8. Multiply by π: 1.28e-8 *3.1416≈4.02e-8 m².

So W=γ*ΔA =0.072 N/m *4.02e-8 m².

Compute 0.072 *4.02e-8:

0.072 *4.02 = let me compute 4 *0.072=0.288, 0.02 *0.072=0.00144. So total 0.28944.

So 0.28944e-8 J = 2.8944e-9 J.

Looking at the options:

Option E is 2.89e-9 J, which matches exactly. So the answer should be E.

To calculate the work required to expand the cell surface against the surface tension, we use the formula:

\[
W = \gamma \Delta A
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the surface tension of water, and \( \Delta A \) is the change in surface area. The cell is spherical, so the surface area of a sphere is given by:

\[
A = 4\pi r^2
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the initial and final radii
The initial radius of the cell is:

\[
r_1 = 20.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m}
\]

The radius increases by a factor of three, so the final radius is:

\[
r_2 = 3 \times r_1 = 3 \times 20.0 \times 10^{-6} = 60.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the change in surface area
The change in surface area is:

\[
\Delta A = A_2 - A_1 = 4\pi r_2^2 - 4\pi r_1^2 = 4\pi (r_2^2 - r_1^2)
\]

Substitute \( r_1 = 20.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m} \) and \( r_2 = 60.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m} \):

\[
r_2^2 - r_1^2 = (60.0 \times 10^{-6})^2 - (20.0 \times 10^{-6})^2 = 3.6 \times 10^{-9} - 0.4 \times 10^{-9} = 3.2 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{m}^2
\]

Thus:

\[
\Delta A = 4\pi (3.2 \times 10^{-9}) = 12.8\pi \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{m}^2
\]

Approximating \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):

\[
\Delta A \approx 12.8 \times 3.1416 \times 10^{-9} = 40.2125 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{m}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the work
The surface tension of water at \( T = 298.15 \, \mathrm{K} \) is approximately:

\[
\gamma = 0.072 \, \mathrm{N/m}
\]

The work required is:

\[
W = \gamma \Delta A = 0.072 \times 40.2125 \times 10^{-9}
\]

First, calculate \( 0.072 \times 40.2125 \):

\[
0.072 \times 40.2125 = 2.8944
\]

Thus:

\[
W = 2.8944 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{J}
\]

### Final Answer
The closest option to \( 2.8944 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{J} \) is:

**E: \( 2.89 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{J} \)**
