Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the demand curve for a perfectly competitive firm. Hmm. I remember that perfect competition has certain characteristics. Let me think.

First, in perfect competition, there are many firms producing a homogeneous product. That means each firm's product is the same as others, so they can't really differentiate. Also, there's free entry and exit, which affects the market structure.

Now, the question is about the demand curve for a single firm in this setup. I think I remember that in perfect competition, the demand curve faced by a single firm is perfectly elastic. Why? Because each firm is a small part of the market. If they raise their price even a little bit, consumers will just buy from another firm instead. So the firm can sell as much as they want at the market price, but if they set a higher price, they sell nothing.

Wait, so the demand curve for a perfectly competitive firm should be horizontal. That means it's perfectly elastic. Because at the market price, they can sell any quantity, but changing the price would result in zero sales. So the curve is a straight horizontal line at the market price.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option C says "perfectly elastic." Option G says "perfectly elastic and equal to the market demand curve." Hmm, wait a second. The market demand curve would be the overall demand in the market, which is downward sloping, right? Because as price increases, quantity demanded decreases.

Wait, so for a perfectly competitive firm, their demand curve is a horizontal line at the market price. That would mean it's a part of the market demand curve, but not the same as the market demand curve. So the firm's demand is perfectly elastic, but the market demand isn't necessarily.

Looking back at the options. Option C says "perfectly elastic." Option G says "perfectly elastic and equal to the market demand." That can't be right because the market demand is downward sloping, not perfectly elastic. So option C seems correct because the individual firm's demand is perfectly elastic.

Wait, but another thought. The demand curve for a perfectly competitive firm is also sometimes said to be the same as the market price because they're price takers. So in their case, the demand curve is horizontal, which is perfectly elastic. So yes, the correct answer should be C: perfectly elastic.

Alternatively, I remember that the firm's demand curve is perfectly elastic because they can sell all they want at the going market price. So that's definitely a horizontal line, meaning elastic. So option C is correct.

In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers, meaning they cannot influence the market price. Their demand curve is perfectly elastic because they can sell any quantity at the market price, but if they try to raise their price above the market price, they will lose all their sales. This results in a horizontal demand curve for the firm. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option C** correctly states that the demand curve is "perfectly elastic."
- **Option G** is incorrect because the firm's demand curve is not equal to the market demand curve; the market demand curve is downward sloping, while the firm's demand curve is horizontal.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: perfectly elastic**.

Answer: C
