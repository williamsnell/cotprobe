Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about finding the smallest positive integer that satisfies three different remainder conditions. Let me take it step by step.

The problem says: find the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 8, a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and a remainder of 7 when divided by 11. The options are given from A to J, so I'll need to check which one fits all these conditions.

First, let's break down each condition. I think the best approach here is to model each condition as a mathematical equation and then find a number that satisfies all three.

Condition 1: The number leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 8. So mathematically, this can be written as:
number ≡ 5 mod 8
Which means the number can be expressed as 8k + 5, where k is some integer.

Condition 2: The number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. So:
number ≡ 1 mod 3
Which can be written as 3m + 1, where m is an integer.

Condition 3: The number leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 11. So:
number ≡ 7 mod 11
Which is 11n + 7, n being an integer.

Now, I need to find a number that satisfies all three equations. One way to approach this is using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), but I'm not too familiar with that, so maybe I can try to find a common number by checking the options provided.

Let me list the options again:
A: 103
B: 100
C: 123
D: 300
E: 315
F: 400
G: 175
H: 233
I: 77
J: 205

I think the smallest number is more likely to be among the smaller options, but I'm not sure. Let's check each condition for each option.

Starting with option I: 77. Let's check each condition.

77 divided by 8: 8*9=72, 77-72=5. So yes, the remainder is 5. That's good for condition 1.

Next, 77 divided by 3: 3*25=75, 77-75=2. Oh wait, the remainder is 2, but we need a remainder of 1. So 77 doesn't satisfy condition 2. So I can eliminate option I.

Next, option J: 205.

205 divided by 8: Let's see, 8*25=200, 205-200=5. So remainder 5, condition 1 is satisfied.

205 divided by 3: 3*68=204, so 205-204=1. So remainder 1, condition 2 is good.

Now condition 3: 205 divided by 11. 11*18=198, 205-198=7. So remainder is 7. That's exactly condition 3. So 205 satisfies all three conditions. But wait, is 205 the smallest among the options? Let me check the other options to see if there's a smaller number that also fits.

Looking at the options, the numbers smaller than 205 are B (100), G (175), and I (77). I already checked I, which didn't work. Let's check G: 175.

175 divided by 8: 8*21=168, 175-168=7. So remainder 7, which doesn't match condition 1 (needs 5). So G is out.

Option B: 100.

100 divided by 8: 8*12=96, remainder 4. But condition 1 requires a remainder of 5. So B is out.

That leaves J:205 as the next candidate. But wait, are there any other options between 100 and 205? Let's see: option E is 315, which is larger, same with others. So 205 is the smallest among the options that fit.

But just to be thorough, I'll check another option, say H:233.

233 divided by 8: 8*29=232, so remainder 1. Doesn't match condition 1 (needs 5). So H is out.

Option E:315.

315/8: 8*39=312, remainder 3. Doesn't meet condition 1.

Option A:103.

103/8: 8*12=96, remainder 7. Doesn't meet condition 1 (needs 5).

Option C:123.

123/8: 8*15=120, remainder 3. Doesn't meet condition 1.

Option D:300.

300/8=37*8=296, remainder 4. Doesn't meet condition 1.

Option F:400.

400/8=50, remainder 0. Doesn't meet condition 1.

So the only option that satisfies all three conditions is J:205.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes there might be a smaller number that's not listed. For example, maybe 205 is the smallest, but perhaps there's a number less than 205 that also fits. Let me try to think without relying on the options.

Using the equations:

We can express the number as N = 8k +5.

We also know that N ≡1 mod 3. So substituting, 8k +5 ≡1 mod3.

8 mod3 is 2, so 2k +5 mod3 ≡1.

5 mod3 is 2, so 2k +2 ≡1 mod3.

Subtracting 2 from both sides: 2k ≡ -1 mod3 → which is same as 2k ≡2 mod3.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and3 are coprime, 2 has inverse mod3. The inverse of 2 mod3 is 2, because 2*2=4≡1 mod3. So multiply both sides by 2: k ≡2*2=4≡1 mod3. So k ≡1 mod3, meaning k=3m+1 for some integer m.

So substituting back into N: N=8*(3m+1)+5=24m +8 +5=24m +13.

So N can be written as 24m +13. Now, this must also satisfy the third condition: N ≡7 mod11.

So 24m +13 ≡7 mod11.

Let me compute 24 mod11 and 13 mod11 first.

24 ÷11 is 2*11=22, remainder 2. So 24 ≡2 mod11.

13 ÷11 is 1*11=11, remainder 2. So 13≡2 mod11.

So substituting, 2m +2 ≡7 mod11.

Subtract 2: 2m ≡5 mod11.

Now, we need to solve for m: 2m ≡5 mod11.

The inverse of 2 mod11 is 6, because 2*6=12≡1 mod11.

So multiply both sides by 6: m ≡5*6=30≡8 mod11 (since 30-2*11=8).

So m=11n +8 for some integer n≥0.

Now, substituting back into N: N=24m +13=24*(11n +8)+13=264n +192 +13=264n +205.

So the smallest positive N occurs when n=0: N=205. If n=1, it's 205+264=469, which is larger.

So the smallest N is 205, which matches option J.

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer that satisfies the following conditions:

1. The number leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 8:  
   \[
   \text{number} \equiv 5 \pmod{8}
   \]  
   This can be expressed as:  
   \[
   \text{number} = 8k + 5 \quad \text{for some integer } k.
   \]

2. The number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3:  
   \[
   \text{number} \equiv 1 \pmod{3}
   \]  
   Substituting \(\text{number} = 8k + 5\) into this condition:  
   \[
   8k + 5 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}.
   \]  
   Since \(8 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}\) and \(5 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}\), this simplifies to:  
   \[
   2k + 2 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}.
   \]  
   Solving for \(k\):  
   \[
   2k \equiv -1 \pmod{3} \quad \text{or} \quad 2k \equiv 2 \pmod{3}.
   \]  
   Dividing through by 2 (the inverse of 2 modulo 3 is 2):  
   \[
   k \equiv 1 \pmod{3}.
   \]  
   Thus, \(k = 3m + 1\) for some integer \(m\). Substituting back:  
   \[
   \text{number} = 8(3m + 1) + 5 = 24m + 13.
   \]

3. The number leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 11:  
   \[
   \text{number} \equiv 7 \pmod{11}.
   \]  
   Substituting \(\text{number} = 24m + 13\) into this condition:  
   \[
   24m + 13 \equiv 7 \pmod{11}.
   \]  
   Since \(24 \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\) and \(13 \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), this simplifies to:  
   \[
   2m + 2 \equiv 7 \pmod{11}.
   \]  
   Solving for \(m\):  
   \[
   2m \equiv 5 \pmod{11}.
   \]  
   The inverse of 2 modulo 11 is 6, so:  
   \[
   m \equiv 5 \cdot 6 \pmod{11} \quad \text{or} \quad m \equiv 30 \pmod{11} \quad \text{or} \quad m \equiv 8 \pmod{11}.
   \]  
   Thus, \(m = 11n + 8\) for some integer \(n\). Substituting back:  
   \[
   \text{number} = 24(11n + 8) + 13 = 264n + 192 + 13 = 264n + 205.
   \]

The smallest positive integer occurs when \(n = 0\):  
\[
\text{number} = 205.
\]

Finally, we verify that 205 satisfies all three conditions:  
- \(205 \div 8 = 25\) with a remainder of 5.  
- \(205 \div 3 = 68\) with a remainder of 1.  
- \(205 \div 11 = 18\) with a remainder of 7.  

Thus, the smallest positive integer that satisfies all the given conditions is **205**, which corresponds to option **J**.
