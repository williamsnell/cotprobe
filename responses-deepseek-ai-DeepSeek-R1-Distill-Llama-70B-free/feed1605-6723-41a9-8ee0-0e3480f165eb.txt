Question:

New York State has a criminal statute making it illegal to knowingly interfere with the operation of government with malicious intent. Corry is a computer hacker, who shut down the New York government's website by infecting it with a virus. The virus entered the electronic mail of users and mailed itself to every address listed in each user's e-mail address book every two hours. The website was crippled for the last week of January. The state passed a law in February clarifying that knowingly infecting the state's internet server with a computer virus met the definition of interference in the statute. During the subsequent criminal trial against Corry in March, the state asked for a jury instruction based on the statutory computer virus clarification. The defense objects to the instruction. How should the state court judge rule?

Options:

A: Admit the instruction, as a bill of attainder.
B: Reject the instruction, as it attempts to apply the law retroactively.
C: Admit the instruction, as it provides clarity on the existing law.
D: Reject the instruction, as it is irrelevant to the case.
E: Admit the instruction, as it is a valid interpretation of the law.
F: Reject the instruction, based on ex post facto.
G: Reject the instruction as a violation of due process.
H: Reject the instruction, as it is not a valid interpretation of the law.
I: Admit the instruction, because the law was passed before the prosecution was initiated.
J: Admit the instruction, as it is a necessary update to the law.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law and statutory interpretation. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll think it through carefully.

The question is about Corry, a hacker who shut down the New York government's website with a virus. The virus spread through emails and caused the site to be down for a week in January. Then, in February, the state passed a law clarifying that knowingly infecting the state's server with a virus falls under the existing statute about interfering with government operations. Now, in March, during the trial, the state wants a jury instruction based on this new clarification, and the defense objects. The question is whether the judge should admit or reject that instruction.

So, the main issue here seems to be about retroactive application of the law. I remember that ex post facto laws are unconstitutional. Ex post facto means that the law is applied retroactively, criminalizing an action that was not illegal at the time it was committed. The US Constitution prohibits ex post facto laws in Article I, Section 9.

Wait, but the initial statute was already in place before Corry's actions, right? The original law made it illegal to interfere with government operations with malicious intent. The problem is that the legislature passed a clarifying amendment after the fact. So, the question is whether this clarification can be applied to Corry's case, which happened before the clarification was passed.

I think the key here is whether the clarification is considered a substantive change or merely a procedural or interpretive one. If the original statute was clear enough that infecting the server was already illegal, then the clarification doesn't change the law retroactively. But if the original statute was ambiguous, and the clarification effectively changes the law, applying it retroactively would be an ex post facto violation.

So, Corry's actions happened in January, the law was passed in February, and the trial is in March. The state is seeking to apply the clarification in the trial. The defense argues that this is applying the law retroactively.

Looking at the options, option F says to reject the instruction based on ex post facto. Option B says to reject because it's retroactive. Option E says to admit as valid interpretation. Option C says admit as clarity on existing law.

Wait, the original statute was about interfering with government operations. Did it specifically mention computer viruses before the clarification? Probably not. So before February, the law didn't explicitly include virus infections. So Corry's actions might not have been clearly illegal under the original statute. Then, in February, the state clarified that such actions are covered. 

If the original statute's application to viruses was unclear, then the February law is changing the law, making it apply to something that wasn't explicitly covered before. Therefore, applying this new interpretation to events that happened before the clarification would be retroactive and thus an ex post facto law, which is unconstitutional.

So, the state's jury instruction would be applying a law that didn't exist at the time Corry acted, which would be an ex post facto application. Therefore, the judge should reject the instruction because it violates the ex post facto clause.

Looking back at the options, option F is "Reject the instruction, based on ex post facto." That seems to fit.

Another angle: the ex post facto clause applies to criminal laws. It prevents increasing the punishment after the fact, but also applies to laws that criminalize conduct that was not criminal before. So if the original statute didn't cover Corry's actions, the new law can't be used to prosecute him for past conduct.

So, the correct answer should be F. The judge should reject the instruction because it's an ex post facto application.

The question revolves around whether a state court judge should admit a jury instruction based on a clarifying law passed after the defendant's actions. The key issue is whether applying this clarification constitutes an unconstitutional ex post facto law, as it would retroactively criminalize conduct that may not have been explicitly illegal at the time of the offense.

The original statute prohibited interfering with government operations with malicious intent, but it did not explicitly mention computer viruses. Corry's actions occurred in January, before the clarifying law was passed in February. The clarifying law specified that infecting the state's server with a virus fell under the existing statute. If the original statute was ambiguous regarding computer viruses, the clarification could be seen as a substantive change to the law, criminalizing conduct that was not clearly illegal at the time of the action.

Applying this clarification retroactively would violate the ex post facto clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits laws that criminalize conduct after the fact. Therefore, the judge should reject the instruction because it would impermissibly apply the law retroactively.
