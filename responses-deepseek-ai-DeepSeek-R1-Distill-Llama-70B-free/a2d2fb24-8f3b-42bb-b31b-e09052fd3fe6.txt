Question:

A victim was standing on a street corner waiting to make a drug buy. The drug dealer was always late, so the victim continued to wait outside in the freezing cold weather because he needed a quick fix. Suddenly a car rounded the street corner and a shot rang out. The victim slumped over and fell to the sidewalk. Immediately after being shot and before he died, the victim exclaimed, "The defendant did it!" The defendant was indicted and is now on trial for the victim's murder. Based on these facts alone, the admissibility of the victim's statement should be determined by

Options:

A: the jury, after a preliminary determination by the judge.
B: the jury, without a preliminary determination by the judge.
C: the judge, only after consultation with a legal expert.
D: the judge, with instruction to the jury that it may consider the dying declaration if it determines that the victim knew he was dying.
E: the police department that conducted the initial investigation.
F: the jury, with instruction from the judge that it may disregard the dying declaration if it determines the victim was under duress.
G: the jury, with a requirement to cross-examine the statement with other presented evidence.
H: the judge, without assistance from the jury.
I: a third-party mediator, to prevent any bias.

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the admissibility of a statement made by a victim who was shot. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Okay, the scenario is that a victim was waiting to buy drugs, got shot, and before dying, said, "The defendant did it!" Now, the defendant is on trial, and the question is about whether this statement is admissible and who decides that.

I remember that statements made under certain circumstances can be exceptions to the hearsay rule. Hearsay is generally inadmissible, but there are exceptions like dying declarations. Wait, what's a dying declaration? From what I recall, a dying declaration is a statement made by someone who believes they are about to die, concerning the cause or circumstances of their impending death. 

So, the key points here are that the victim was shot, fell, and then made the statement before dying. The question is whether this qualifies as a dying declaration. If it does, then it's admissible as an exception to hearsay.

Next, who decides whether the statement fits the exception? I think the judge first determines whether the statement meets the legal criteria for a dying declaration. That would involve the judge assessing whether the victim had a subjective belief that death was imminent. If the judge decides it's admissible, then the statement goes to the jury. But the ultimate decision on whether it's a dying declaration is for the judge to make initially.

Wait, but sometimes the jury might consider the credibility or weight of the statement, but the admissibility is a matter for the court. So, the judge would make a preliminary determination that the statement qualifies as a dying declaration, and then the jury can consider its weight.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the jury decides after a preliminary determination by the judge. That fits because the judge first rules it's admissible, and then the jury can weigh it.

Option D says the judge decides with instructions to the jury that it may consider the declaration if it determines the victim knew he was dying. Wait, but the initial determination is up to the judge, not the jury. The judge decides whether it's a dying declaration, so the instruction in D might be mixing things up.

Option H says the judge decides without assistance from the jury. That could be correct because the admissibility is for the judge, but the jury still hears the statement if it's admitted.

Wait, the question is about who determines the admissibility. So the judge makes the initial call on whether it's admissible as a dying declaration. Once admitted, the jury can consider it as evidence, but the admissibility is determined by the judge.

So, looking back, the options are A and D. Option A says the jury decides after the judge's preliminary determination. But wait, no, the admissibility is determined by the judge, not the jury. So the judge makes the determination, and then the jury can hear it. So the admissibility is up to the judge, and the jury doesn't decide that. They just consider the evidence once it's admitted.

Wait, but the options have to be read carefully. Option D says the judge determines admissibility with an instruction that the jury may consider it if they find the victim knew he was dying. But I think the judge's role is to determine whether the statement meets the criteria (like whether the declarant believed they were dying). So the judge decides admissibility, and then the jury can assess the credibility, but the initial admissibility is the judge's call.

So the correct approach is that the judge first decides if it's a dying declaration, then the jury can consider it as evidence. So the admissibility is determined by the judge. But looking at the options, let me see.

Option A says the jury decides after the judge's preliminary determination. Wait, no. The admissibility is determined by the judge, not the jury. So the correct answer would be that the judge determines admissibility, and the jury then considers the evidence.

Wait, the question is phrased as "the admissibility... should be determined by" which body. So the admissibility is for the judge to decide, so the answer would involve the judge making that call.

Looking again at the options:

Option D: the judge, with instruction to the jury that it may consider the dying declaration if it determines the victim knew he was dying.

But wait, the judge has to determine whether the statement qualifies as a dying declaration in the first place. So the judge's instruction would tell the jury that it's a dying declaration, but the determination is up to the judge. Alternatively, some sources say that the judge first decides whether it's admissible, and then the jury can consider it. So the admissibility is determined by the judge, and the jury doesn't decide that but may assess its weight.

So the correct answer should be that the judge determines admissibility, and the jury then considers the statement. So looking at the options, which one reflects that?

Option D says the judge determines it, with an instruction to the jury about considering it if they find the victim knew he was dying. But that seems to mix up the roles. The judge determines admissibility, not the jury. So perhaps the correct option is A, but no, A says the jury decides after the judge's preliminary determination. But that would mean the jury makes the final admissibility decision, which isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the roles. In some cases, the judge makes a preliminary determination, and then the jury decides the weight, but admissibility is solely the judge's role.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is D, but I'm not sure. Another thought: the dying declaration is an exception under FRE 804(b)(2), which requires that the declarant's statement was made under a belief of impending death. The court (judge) must determine that the declarant is unavailable (which they are, since deceased) and that the statement was made under the belief of impending death. So the judge determines admissibility. Once admitted, the jury can consider it as evidence.

So the admissibility is determined by the judge, and the jury doesn't decide that. So the answer should be an option where the judge determines admissibility, and the jury is instructed accordingly.

Looking at the options:

Option D: the judge, with instruction to the jury that it may consider the dying declaration if it determines the victim knew he was dying.

But that instruction seems to put part of the determination on the jury, which isn't correct. Because the judge has already determined that the statement qualifies as a dying declaration. So the jury doesn't need to decide that; they just consider the statement as evidence.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A, but that would mean the jury decides admissibility after the judge's preliminary. That can't be right because the judge is the gatekeeper for admissibility.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is H: the judge, without assistance from the jury. Because the judge determines admissibility, and the jury just hears the statement as evidence.

But looking back, the initial determination is for the judge, so the admissibility is determined by the judge. So the correct option is either D or H.

Wait, another approach: in a jury trial, the judge rules on the admissibility of evidence. So the judge decides if the statement is admissible under the dying declaration exception. Once it's admitted, the jury can hear it and weigh its credibility. So the admissibility is decided by the judge, and the jury doesn't make that determination.

So the correct answer would be that the judge determines admissibility, which is option H or D.

Option H says the judge decides without assistance from the jury. That seems correct because it's the judge's role as the gatekeeper of evidence.

But wait, another thought: the dying declaration is a hearsay exception, so under FRE 804(b)(2), the judge must make a determination that the declarant is unavailable and that the statement was made under the belief of impending death. So the judge determines admissibility, and the jury then considers the evidence. So the admissibility is determined by the judge, and the jury doesn't decide that.

So the correct answer would be that the admissibility is determined by the judge, so the options that say the judge are H and D. 

Option D involves the judge instructing the jury, but the key point is that the judge decides admissibility. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is D: the judge, with instruction to the jury that it may consider the dying declaration if it determines that the victim knew he was dying.

No, that can't be right because the judge has already determined that the statement is admissible as a dying declaration. The jury doesn't need to make that determination again. The instruction would be that the statement is admissible, and the jury can consider it. So the instruction wouldn't be telling the jury to determine whether the victim knew he was dying; that's the judge's role.

So perhaps the correct answer is option D is incorrect because the instruction is about the jury making that determination, which they shouldn't. Therefore, the correct option is H: the judge, without assistance from the jury.

So the admissibility is determined by the judge, and the jury just considers it as evidence once it's admitted.

Wait, but sometimes the judge's determination is subject to review, but the initial decision is the judge's.

So I think the answer is A: the jury, after a preliminary determination by the judge.

Wait, no, because that would mean the jury decides admissibility after the judge's preliminary determination, which isn't correct. Admissibility is for the judge alone.

So perhaps the answer is H: the judge, without assistance from the jury.

But looking at the options again:

Option D says the judge decides with an instruction to the jury about considering it if the victim knew he was dying. That instruction is incorrect because it's the judge who decides that, not the jury.

Therefore, the correct answer must be H: the judge, without assistance from the jury.

Wait, but wait another point. The statement is "The defendant did it!" made immediately after being shot and before dying. So the victim's statement is a dying declaration only if the victim believed death was imminent. The judge must decide whether the victim had that belief. So the admissibility is up to the judge.

So the answer is that the judge determines admissibility, so option H is correct.

But looking again, option D says the judge, with instruction to the jury that it may consider the declaration if it determines the victim knew he was dying. That instruction is wrong because the judge has already made that determination.

Therefore, the correct option is H: the judge decides without the jury's involvement in the admissibility determination.
</think>

The admissibility of the victim's statement, made immediately after being shot and before dying, is governed by the legal principles surrounding dying declarations. A dying declaration is an exception to the hearsay rule and is admissible if the declarant (the victim) believed they were about to die and the statement concerns the cause or circumstances of their impending death. 

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(2), the court (judge) must first determine whether the statement qualifies as a dying declaration. This involves assessing whether the victim had a subjective belief in their imminent death. If the judge determines that the statement meets the criteria for a dying declaration, it is admitted into evidence, and the jury can then consider its weight and credibility. However, the ultimate decision on admissibility is solely the responsibility of the judge, not the jury.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. While the judge makes a preliminary determination, the jury does not decide admissibility; the judge is the final arbiter of whether the statement qualifies as a dying declaration.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The jury does not determine admissibility without a preliminary determination by the judge.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. There is no requirement for the judge to consult a legal expert in making this determination.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While the judge determines admissibility, the instruction described in this option is flawed. The judge decides whether the victim believed they were dying, and the jury does not reassess this determination.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The police department has no role in determining the admissibility of evidence.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The jury does not disregard the statement based on duress; admissibility is determined by the judge.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The jury does not cross-examine the statement for admissibility; that is the judge's role.
- **Option H**: Correct. The judge determines admissibility without assistance from the jury, as the judge is the gatekeeper of evidence.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. A third-party mediator has no role in this process.

The correct answer is that the judge determines the admissibility of the statement without assistance from the jury. 

**Answer: H**
