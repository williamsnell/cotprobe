The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A permanent resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper. A state trooper is a member of the state police force, a law enforcement body that exercises broad police authority throughout the state. The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. "Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen. In an opinion upholding the validity of the statute, the State Attorney General noted that since police officers fall within the category of important non-elective officials who participate directly in the execution of broad public policy, only citizens of the United States should be qualified to apply for such positions. "At the time the resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper, he was a citizen of a foreign country and not currently eligible for citizenship. As a result of a federal statute, Congress has imposed a five-year residency requirement for the attainment of citizenship. Under this federal law, an alien must reside in this country for a period of five years as a prerequisite before applying for citizenship. At this time, the resident alien had only lawfully been residing in the United States for two years, and thus would not be eligible to apply for naturalization until three years later. If the resident alien brings suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state statute limiting the membership of its state police force to citizens of the United States, the court will most likely declare the statute

Options:

A: constitutional, because citizenship bears a rational relationship to the special demands of the police function.
B: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
C: constitutional, as it falls under the state's right to regulate its own law enforcement bodies.
D: unconstitutional, as it infringes on the resident alien's right to seek employment.
E: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
F: constitutional, because the resident alien does not yet meet the federal requirements for citizenship.
G: unconstitutional, because it is an unfair restriction on the resident alien's opportunity for employment.
H: constitutional, because the statute is within the state's plenary power to regulate the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.
I: unconstitutional, because it violates the resident alien's rights under the Fifth Amendment.
J: constitutional, because the statute does not specifically discriminate against any particular nationality or ethnicity.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with the issue of whether a state can exclude permanent resident aliens from becoming state troopers. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says that a permanent resident alien applied for a state trooper position, but the state refused him because of a state statute requiring that all state police members be U.S. citizens. The state's reasoning is that police officers are important officials who execute public policy, so only citizens should qualify.

The resident alien is currently not eligible for citizenship because of a federal five-year residency requirement, and he's only been here two years. He's suing in federal court, challenging the constitutionality of the state statute.

So, the options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about the legal principles involved here.

I remember that the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment applies to states and prohibits discrimination based on certain classifications. Aliens, including resident aliens, are considered a suspect class for equal protection purposes, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, I think it's more about whether the classification is based on something like nationality or race, which are suspect, but sometimes it's about rational basis.

In the case of state laws restricting certain jobs to citizens, there's a line of Supreme Court cases. I recall the case of Cabell v. Chavez-Salido, which dealt with a similar issue regarding probation officers. The Court held that a state could require citizenship for certain public jobs that are considered part of the state's sovereign functions. The reasoning was that such positions involve functions that are an integral part of the state's governance and require a tie to the polity, which citizenship ensures.

In that case, the Court applied a rational basis test but found the requirement justified because the jobs were in the executive branch and involved discretionary enforcement. So, for positions that are considered part of the "state's sovereign functions," the citizenship requirement is constitutional.

Here, state troopers are part of the state police force, which exercises broad police authority. They're involved in law enforcement and executing public policy. That sounds similar to the positions in the Cabell case. So, the state's statute would likely be upheld as constitutional.

Looking at the options:

A: Constitutional because citizenship relates to police demands. This seems to align with the reasoning in Cabell. The idea is that police functions are closely tied to the state's sovereign powers, so requiring citizenship is rational.

B: Unconstitutional under Equal Protection. But if the higher court has upheld similar laws, then this might not be correct. So maybe B is not the right choice.

C: Constitutional under state's right to regulate law enforcement. That makes sense, but the question is more about the Equal Protection challenge, so the answer might be more specific than that.

D: Unconstitutional as it infringes on employment rights. But the state can have certain job requirements, especially for positions involving public trust.

E: Due process violation. I don't think due process is the main issue here; it's more about equal protection.

F: Constitutional because the alien isn't a citizen yet. But the issue is the state's requirement, not his eligibility, so this might not address the constitutional challenge.

G: Unconstitutional as unfair employment restriction. But again, the courts have allowed such restrictions for certain jobs.

H: Constitutional under state's police powers for health, safety, welfare. This is a broader statement but might be correct. However, the more precise reasoning would be about sovereign functions.

I: Fifth Amendment violation. The Fifth Amendment's due process applies to federal actions, and this is a state law, so it's more about the 14th Amendment.

J: Constitutional because no specific nationality is targeted. That's true, but the challenge is about excluding all non-citizens, which is a broader category, not a specific nationality.

So, the best answer seems to be A, because it directly ties the citizenship requirement to the special demands of the police function, which is a rational basis and supported by case law like Cabell. Alternatively, C and H are also possibilities, but A is more specific to the reasoning.

The question involves a constitutional challenge to a state statute requiring state troopers to be U.S. citizens. The resident alien, ineligible for citizenship due to federal residency requirements, argues the statute violates constitutional principles. The correct answer hinges on whether the citizenship requirement is constitutional for state police positions.

The Supreme Court has addressed similar issues, such as in *Cabell v. Chavez-Salido*, where it upheld citizenship requirements for certain public positions involving sovereign functions. State troopers, as law enforcement officers executing broad public policy, fall into this category. The citizenship requirement is rationally related to the state's interest in ensuring that those in such roles are tied to the polity they serve.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is correct because it aligns with the reasoning that citizenship bears a rational relationship to the special demands of police functions, supported by relevant case law.
- **B, D, E, G, I** are incorrect as they misapply constitutional principles or ignore established precedents upholding such requirements for certain public positions.
- **C, F, H, J** are less precise or address broader concepts without directly tying to the specific legal reasoning.

Thus, the most accurate answer is **A**.

Answer: A
