Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out which pair of expressions is equivalent for any variable value greater than zero. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

The question gives me ten options, labeled A through J. Each option presents two expressions, and I need to determine which pair is equivalent, meaning they simplify to the same thing for any positive variable value.

Alright, let's start by looking at each option one by one. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to go slowly and make sure I understand each part.

Option A: 4n + 2o and 8no. Wait, 4n plus 2o doesn't seem like it would combine into 8no. Because 4n + 2o is just adding two terms, while 8no is a product of n and o. Unless there's some factoring, but I don't see how 4n + 2o could be factored into something with no. Maybe if I factor 2 out of 4n + 2o, I get 2(2n + o), which isn't the same as 8no. So I don't think A is correct.

Option B: 2j + 2j + k and 4jk. Let's see, 2j + 2j is 4j, so the first expression becomes 4j + k. The second expression is 4jk, which is 4j multiplied by k. But 4j + k is not the same as 4jk because one is addition and the other is multiplication. So B isn't the right choice.

Option C: 5h + 3i and 15hi. Hmm, 5h plus 3i can't be combined through multiplication. 5h + 3i is just adding two terms, but 15hi would imply that 5h * 3i equals 15hi. But 5h + 3i isn't the same as their product. So C doesn't look right either.

Option D: 4d + 2e and 8d+e. Wait, 4d + 2e can be factored as 2(2d + e), but 8d + e is just combining 8d and e. These don't look equivalent. If I set 4d + 2e equal to 8d + e, that would imply that 4d + 2e = 8d + e, which simplifies to 0=4d - e, meaning e=4d. But that's only true for specific values of d and e, not for all positive variables. So D isn't correct.

Option E: s + s + 2t and 2st. Let's compute the first expression: s + s is 2s, plus 2t makes it 2s + 2t, which is 2(s + t). The second expression is 2st, which is 2 times s times t. So 2(s + t) is not the same as 2st unless s + t equals st, which isn't generally true. So E isn't the answer.

Option F: f + f + f + g and 3fg. The first expression is 3f + g. The second is 3fg, which is 3 times f times g. 3f + g isn't equal to 3fg because one is addition and the other is multiplication. So F isn't correct.

Option G: b + b + 3c and 2b + 3c. Wait, the first expression is 2b + 3c. The second expression is also 2b + 3c. Oh! They're exactly the same. So G's expressions are identical, which means they're equivalent for any value. That seems like a possible correct answer.

But let me check the remaining options just to be thorough.

Option H: p + q + q + r and 2pqr. Simplifying the first expression: p + 2q + r. The second is 2pqr. These are entirely different. One is a sum, the other a product. So H isn't correct.

Option I: l + m + m and 2lm. The first expression is l + 2m. The second is 2lm. Again, adding variables vs. multiplying; they're not equivalent. So I isn't right.

Option J: 3(x + 2) and 3x + 2. Let's expand 3(x + 2), which is 3x + 6. So 3x +6 vs. 3x +2. These are not the same because 6 isn't equal to 2. So J isn't correct.

Wait, so I thought G was the correct one because the expressions are the same. But let me double-check. Option G: b + b + 3c is 2b +3c, and the second expression is 2b +3c. Yes, they're identical. So G is correct.

To determine which pair of expressions is equivalent for any variable value greater than zero, let's analyze each option:

**A:** \(4n + 2o\) and \(8no\)  
\(4n + 2o\) simplifies to \(2(2n + o)\), which is not equivalent to \(8no\).  

**B:** \(2j + 2j + k\) and \(4jk\)  
\(2j + 2j + k = 4j + k\), which is not equivalent to \(4jk\).  

**C:** \(5h + 3i\) and \(15hi\)  
\(5h + 3i\) cannot be combined to form \(15hi\), as one is a sum and the other is a product.  

**D:** \(4d + 2e\) and \(8d + e\)  
\(4d + 2e = 2(2d + e)\), which is not equivalent to \(8d + e\).  

**E:** \(s + s + 2t\) and \(2st\)  
\(s + s + 2t = 2s + 2t = 2(s + t)\), which is not equivalent to \(2st\).  

**F:** \(f + f + f + g\) and \(3fg\)  
\(f + f + f + g = 3f + g\), which is not equivalent to \(3fg\).  

**G:** \(b + b + 3c\) and \(2b + 3c\)  
\(b + b + 3c = 2b + 3c\), which is identical to the second expression.  

**H:** \(p + q + q + r\) and \(2pqr\)  
\(p + q + q + r = p + 2q + r\), which is not equivalent to \(2pqr\).  

**I:** \(l + m + m\) and \(2lm\)  
\(l + m + m = l + 2m\), which is not equivalent to \(2lm\).  

**J:** \(3(x + 2)\) and \(3x + 2\)  
\(3(x + 2) = 3x + 6\), which is not equivalent to \(3x + 2\).  

The only pair of expressions that is equivalent for any variable value greater than zero is in **G**.
