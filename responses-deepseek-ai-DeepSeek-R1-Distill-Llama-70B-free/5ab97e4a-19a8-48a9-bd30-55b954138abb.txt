Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it says.

The problem is about function graphs. It says that the graph of y = f(x) includes the points (1,5), (2,3), and (3,1). So, that means when x is 1, y is 5, which I can write as f(1) = 5. Similarly, f(2) = 3 and f(3) = 1. Got that.

Now, the question is about the graph of y = f(f(x)). I need to find two points that must be on this graph and then calculate ab + cd, where (a,b) and (c,d) are these points. The options are given as A to J, so I'll have to compute the numbers and match them.

Hmm, okay, so y = f(f(x)) is a composition of functions. So for a given x, I first apply f to x, then apply f again to the result. So the steps are: take x, find f(x), then find f of that value.

Let me think about each of the given points and see if I can compute f(f(x)) for x values where I know both f(x) and f(f(x)).

The known points are x=1, x=2, x=3. Let me make a table to keep track.

For x=1:
f(1) =5
Then f(f(1)) = f(5)
Wait, but wait, do I know what f(5) is? The problem only gives me f(1), f(2), f(3). So I don't have information about f(5). So for x=1, f(f(1)) is f(5) which is unknown. So I can't determine a point on y=f(f(x)) for x=1.

For x=2:
f(2)=3
So f(f(2)) = f(3) =1
Oh, wait, yes! Because f(3)=1 is given. So for x=2, y=1. So the point (2,1) must be on the graph of y=f(f(x)).

Similarly, for x=3:
f(3)=1
Then f(f(3))=f(1)=5
So for x=3, y=5. So the point (3,5) is on the graph.

Wait, so that gives me two points: (2,1) and (3,5). Are these the only ones? Because for x=1, I don't know f(5), so I can't say anything about f(f(1)).

So the two points are (2,1) and (3,5). Now, I need to calculate ab + cd, where a and b are from the first point, and c and d from the second.

So for (2,1): a=2, b=1. So ab = 2*1=2.

For (3,5): c=3, d=5. So cd = 3*5=15.

Adding them: 2 + 15 =17.

So the answer should be 17, which is option B.

Wait, let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes?

Let me go through each step again.

Given f(1)=5, f(2)=3, f(3)=1.

f(f(1))=f(5) which is unknown, so no point there.

f(f(2))=f(3)=1 → point (2,1).

f(f(3))=f(1)=5 → point (3,5).

So yes, those are correct. Then ab for (2,1) is 2*1=2. For (3,5), 3*5=15. 2+15=17.

Looking at the options, option B is 17. So that's the answer.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given points on the graph of \( y = f(x) \): \( (1, 5) \), \( (2, 3) \), and \( (3, 1) \). This means:

- \( f(1) = 5 \)
- \( f(2) = 3 \)
- \( f(3) = 1 \)

We are tasked with finding points on the graph of \( y = f(f(x)) \). To do this, we compute \( f(f(x)) \) for the given \( x \)-values:

1. For \( x = 1 \):  
   \( f(1) = 5 \), but \( f(5) \) is unknown because it is not provided in the problem. Therefore, we cannot determine \( f(f(1)) \).

2. For \( x = 2 \):  
   \( f(2) = 3 \), and \( f(3) = 1 \). Thus, \( f(f(2)) = f(3) = 1 \). This gives the point \( (2, 1) \).

3. For \( x = 3 \):  
   \( f(3) = 1 \), and \( f(1) = 5 \). Thus, \( f(f(3)) = f(1) = 5 \). This gives the point \( (3, 5) \).

The two points on the graph of \( y = f(f(x)) \) are \( (2, 1) \) and \( (3, 5) \). To compute \( ab + cd \), where \( (a, b) = (2, 1) \) and \( (c, d) = (3, 5) \):

- \( ab = 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \)
- \( cd = 3 \cdot 5 = 15 \)
- \( ab + cd = 2 + 15 = 17 \)

Thus, the final answer is:

**B: 17**
