Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle and electrons. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty principle has something to do with not being able to know both the position and momentum of a particle exactly. Oh right, it's Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.

The question says: What is the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron if we know its position is somewhere in a 10 picometer (pm) interval? The options are from A to J with different values.

Wait, I think the formula for the uncertainty principle is something like Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. Right, so Δx is the uncertainty in position, and Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. So if I know the position within a certain range, I can find the minimum uncertainty in momentum.

But wait, the position is known to be within a 10 pm interval. So that's Δx = 10 pm. Oh, but wait, wait. Sometimes Δx is taken as the standard deviation, but sometimes it's the full interval. I think in the uncertainty principle, Δx is the standard deviation, but sometimes when people say the position is known within a range, they mean that the uncertainty is approximately that range. So maybe I can take Δx as 10 pm here.

First, let me convert all units to standard units. 10 pm is 10 picometers, which is 10^-12 meters. Because 1 pm is 1e-12 m.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. But in some formulas, I've seen h-bar (ħ) used, which is h/(2π). So the uncertainty principle is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle equation is Δx * Δp ≥ (h/(4π)). Because ħ = h/(2π), so substituting, ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, the exact inequality is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. Or is it Δx Δp ≥ h/(4π)? Because I've seen both forms. Let me think. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34, and ħ is h/(2π), which is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So the uncertainty principle is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. Or wait, wait, no, I think it's Δx Δp ≥ ħ/(2√2) when using standard deviations. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. I think the exact form is Δx Δp ≥ (ħ/2), assuming that Δx and Δp are the standard deviations of position and momentum, respectively.

Wait, maybe I should double-check. So Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum is at least h/(4π), which is ħ/2. So yes, Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2.

So I can rearrange this to find Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx).

Given that, I can plug in the numbers. So Δx is 10 pm, which is 1e-11 meters? Wait no, 10 pm is 10e-12 meters, which is 1e-11 m? No, wait: 1 pm is 1e-12 m. So 10 pm is 10e-12 m, which is 1e-11 m. Oh wait, 10 pm is 10 times 1e-12, so 1e-11 meters. Got it.

So Δx = 1e-11 m.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So plugging into the formula, Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-11).

Let me compute that. 2 * 1e-11 is 2e-11. So 1.05e-34 divided by 2e-11 is (1.05e-34)/(2e-11) = (1.05 / 2) * 1e-23.

1.05 divided by 2 is about 0.525. So 0.525e-23 kg·m/s.

Wait, but that gives me 5.25e-24 kg·m/s. Wait, wait no, 0.525e-23 is 5.25e-24? Wait no, because 1e-23 is 1e-23, so 0.525e-23 is 5.25e-24? Wait, wait: no.

Wait, 0.525e-23 is 5.25 x 10^-24, because 0.525 is 5.25 x 10^-1. So 5.25e-1 * 1e-23 is 5.25e-24.

Wait, but that seems small. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 1e-11 is 1e-11 m. So 2e-11 is 2e-11. So, 1.05e-34 / (2e-11) = (1.05 / 2) * 1e-34 / 1e-11. 1e-34 / 1e-11 is 1e-23. So yes. So 1.05/2 is 0.525. So 0.525e-23 kg·m/s.

So that's 5.25e-24 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 5.25e-24. Let me see the options again.

Options are:

A: 4.2e-23

B:7.2e-23

C:5.0e-23

D:3.3e-23

E:7.7e-23

F:2.1e-23

G:5.5e-23

H:6.6e-23

I:8.8e-23

J:9.1e-23

So none of these are 5.25e-24. Hmm, that's ten times smaller than any of the options, which all are in the 1e-23 range. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the exponent when converting pm to meters. Let's recheck that. 1 pm is 1e-12 m. So 10 pm is 10 * 1e-12 = 1e-11 m. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Because sometimes the uncertainty principle is written as Δx Δp ≈ h/(4π), which is roughly 1e-34/(1e1) )? Wait no, exact value of h/(4π) is about 1.0545718e-34 / (4 * 3.1416) )? Wait no, wait: h is 6.626e-34, so h/(4π) is 6.626e-34/(12.566) )= approx 5.27e-35.

Wait, no, let me compute. 4π is approximately 12.566. So h is 6.626e-34, so h/(4π) = 6.626e-34 / 12.566 ≈ 5.27e-35 J·s.

Wait, but if I use Δx Δp ≥ h/(4π), then Δp ≥ h/(4π Δx).

So let's try that. h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So Δp = 6.626e-34 / (4π * 1e-11) )

Compute denominator: 4 * π ≈12.566, 12.566e-11.

So, 6.626e-34 / 12.566e-11 = (6.626 / 12.566) * 1e-23.

6.626 / 12.566 ≈ 0.527. So 0.527e-23 kg·m/s → 5.27e-24 kg·m/s.

Same result as before. So why are the options all in the 1e-23 range? Did I miss a factor somewhere?

Wait a minute, perhaps the question is considering Δx as the full width (like the interval), and not the standard deviation. So maybe they're using the approximate formula where Δx is the range and Δp is approximated as h/(2Δx), or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe I'm forgetting the mass of the electron. Because I'm using the uncertainty principle for momentum, but perhaps I should be considering the relation involving the mass.

Wait, wait, no. The uncertainty principle relates Δx and Δp directly, regardless of mass. Because Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, which is mass times velocity. So the formula doesn't involve mass. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, wait. I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the numbers.

Compute Δp = h/(4π Δx)

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

Δx = 1e-11 m.

So 4π Δx = 4 * 3.1416 * 1e-11 ≈12.566 * 1e-11 = 1.2566e-10 m.

Wait, no, 4π is 12.566, so 12.566e-11 m.

Wait wait, no: 4π is 12.566, and multiplied by Δx which is 1e-11 m → 12.566e-11 m. So 12.566e-11 m is the denominator.

So 6.626e-34 / 12.566e-11 → let me compute numerator and denominator.

6.626e-34 / 12.566e-11 = (6.626 / 12.566) * (1e-34 / 1e-11) ) → 6.626/12.566 ≈ 0.527. And 1e-34 / 1e-11 is 1e-23.

So 0.527 * 1e-23 → 5.27e-24 kg·m/s.

But the options are all in 1e-23. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the uncertainty in position as the standard deviation, which is a factor of sqrt(3) or something. Alternatively, perhaps the position uncertainty is taken as the full width at half maximum, or something else, which would adjust the calculated Δp.

Wait, another thought: In some derivations, the uncertainty principle is written as Δx * Δp ≥ h/(2√2 π) ) or something like that. Or perhaps the minimum uncertainty is when Δx Δp = h/(4π), but sometimes people use approximate versions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used h-bar (ħ) instead of h in the formula. Let me think. Because the formula can be written as Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ = h/(2π). So let's compute with that.

So Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. So Δp ≥ ħ/(2 Δx).

ħ is approx 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ/(2 * 1e-11 m) = 1.0545718e-34 / (2e-11) → 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-11 = (1.0545718 / 2) * 1e-23.

1.0545718 / 2 is approx 0.527. So 0.527e-23 kg·m/s → 5.27e-24 kg·m/s.

Same result as before, which still doesn't match the options. So why are the options in the 1e-23 range?

Wait, perhaps the question is using the formula without the 4π denominator. Like using Δp ≈ h/(Δx), without the 4π factor. That would make the uncertainty much larger.

Let me try that. So if Δp ≈ h/(Δx), then h is 6.626e-34, and Δx is 1e-11 m. So 6.626e-34 / 1e-11 = 6.626e-23 kg·m/s.

But none of the options are exactly 6.6e-23, but option H is 6.6e-23. So that would be option H.

But wait, that approach ignores the factor of 4π, which would be incorrect because the uncertainty principle includes that factor.

So I'm a bit confused. On one hand, the correct calculation gives me 5.27e-24, which isn't among the options. On the other hand, if I ignore the 4π and just compute h/(Δx), I get 6.6e-23, which is option H.

But wait, perhaps the question intended to use Δx as the standard deviation, but then the calculation is correct as I did before. But the options don't have that value.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the Compton wavelength, which is h/(m_e c), but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, could I have made a mistake in the exponent? Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 10 pm is 10e-12 m, which is 1e-11 m. Correct.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So Δp = h/(4π * 1e-11) → 6.626e-34 / (4π * 1e-11).

4π is about 12.566. So 6.626e-34 / 12.566e-11 → 6.626 / 12.566 is about 0.527, and 1e-34 / 1e-11 is 1e-23. So 0.527e-23 → 5.27e-24.

But the options are all higher, like 3e-23 and up. So maybe the question considers the position uncertainty as the diameter instead of the radius, but that would make Δx twice as big, which would make Δp half as much, so 2.6e-24, which is even smaller. That doesn't help.

Wait another thought: Maybe the question is using the electron mass somewhere? But the uncertainty principle doesn't involve mass. Unless they're considering kinetic energy or something else. Wait, no, momentum is mass times velocity. But in the uncertainty principle, it's just the product of uncertainties, so mass doesn't come into play.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the formula and it's actually Δp ≈ h/(2π Δx). So let's try that.

So h is 6.626e-34. 2π is about 6.283. So 6.626e-34 / (6.283 * 1e-11) → 6.626 / 6.283 ≈ 1.055, so 1.055e-23 kg·m/s.

That's approximately 1.055e-23. Looking at the options, the closest one would be option A (4.2e-23 is higher), option B is 7.2e-23, which is higher. Option C is 5e-23. Option D is 3.3e-23. So none of these are exactly 1e-23. The closest higher is D:3.3e-23, but that's still higher than 1e-23.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor somewhere else. Let's think again.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the question isn't precise in how it states the position uncertainty. If the position is known to within 10 pm, that's the uncertainty in position, so Δx = 10 pm = 1e-11 m.

Then, using Δp ≥ h/(4π Δx).

h=6.626e-34, 4π=12.566, so 6.626e-34 / (12.566e-11) → 6.626 /12.566 ≈ 0.527 → 0.527e-23 → 5.27e-24 kg·m/s.

But again, that's not matching any option. So perhaps the intended approach is to use h instead of h-bar, without the 4π denominator.

So if I compute Δp = h/(2 * Δx) → 6.626e-34/(2 * 1e-11) → 3.313e-23 kg·m/s.

Wait, that's 3.313e-23. Looking at the options, option D is 3.3e-23. So that's close.

So that would be option D.

But why is this different from the correct approach? Because the correct formula includes 4π in the denominator. So perhaps the question is using a simplified version without the 4π factor, leading to Δp ≈ h/(2Δx).

So using Δp ≈ h/(2Δx) gives 3.3e-23, which matches option D.

In that case, the correct answer would be D:3.3e-23.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the correct approach with the uncertainty principle would lead to a lower value, but perhaps the question is using a simplified formula without considering the 4π factor.

So, in conclusion, the answer should be D:3.3e-23 kg·m/s.

To determine the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron when its position is known within a $10 \, \mathrm{pm}$ interval, we use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{h}{4\pi},
\]

where:
- $\Delta x$ is the uncertainty in position,
- $\Delta p$ is the uncertainty in momentum,
- $h$ is Planck's constant ($6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s}$),
- $4\pi$ is a constant.

### Step 1: Convert $\Delta x$ to standard units
The position uncertainty is given as $10 \, \mathrm{pm}$, which is $10 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{m} = 1.0 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{m}$.

### Step 2: Rearrange the formula to solve for $\Delta p$
Rearranging the uncertainty principle to solve for $\Delta p$ gives:

\[
\Delta p \geq \frac{h}{4\pi \cdot \Delta x}.
\]
