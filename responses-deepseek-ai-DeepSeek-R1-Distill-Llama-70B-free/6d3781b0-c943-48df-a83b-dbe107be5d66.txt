Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Kelsen’s theory of law, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by recalling what I know about Hans Kelsen and his Pure Theory of Law. 

From what I remember, Kelsen was a legal philosopher, and his Pure Theory is a significant contribution to jurisprudence. The term "pure" probably refers to the idea of keeping law distinct from other areas. I think he wanted to separate law from other fields like sociology, ethics, or politics. 

Wait, so why is it called "pure"? Maybe because he was trying to purify the study of law by removing influences from other disciplines. That makes sense because I remember him arguing that legal theory should be independent. 

Looking at the options now. Option C says he separated law from religion, ethics, sociology, and history. That sounds familiar. I think that's exactly what the Pure Theory is about—keeping law as a distinct science, not mixed with other social sciences or moral theories. 

Other options: A says he only discussed jurisprudence. Well, he did more than just discuss; he developed a theory. Plus, 'purely discussed' seems vague. Option B mentions defining law according to morality and purity. No, Kelsen actually wanted to separate law from morality, not define it in terms of morality. So B doesn't fit. Option D talks about discussing law purely in terms of justice. Again, I think he was more about separating from other areas rather than focusing solely on justice. 

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be C. He separated law from those other fields to make it a pure theory.

The correct answer is C. Kelsen’s Pure Theory of Law emphasizes the separation of law from other disciplines such as religion, ethics, sociology, and history, aiming to establish law as an independent field of study. 

Answer: C
