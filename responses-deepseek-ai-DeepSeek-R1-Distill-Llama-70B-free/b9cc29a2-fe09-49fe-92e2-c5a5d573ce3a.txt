Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Now, we have organized a society, and we call it "Share Our Wealth Society," a society with the motto "Every Man a King."…
We propose to limit the wealth of big men in the country. There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today.
We do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality … but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.…
We will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Huey P. Long's "Share Our Wealth Society." I'm a bit rusty on my U.S. history, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Huey Long was a senator from Louisiana during the Great Depression. His movement was called "Share Our Wealth," and its motto was "Every Man a King." The main idea was to redistribute wealth, right? So, the question is why this society attracted so many followers in 1934.

Looking at the provided text, Long talks about limiting the wealth of the rich. He mentions that the average family wealth is $15,000 and proposes that no one should have to live in poverty. He suggests a minimum of around $5,000 per family, which would provide basic conveniences and opportunities. Also, he wants to cap individual fortunes at $50 million.

Now, the options are from A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: The society proposed a revolutionary idea of limiting individual fortunes to $50 million. Well, that's part of what they did, but was that the main reason people followed? Maybe, but perhaps there's a broader reason.

Option B: There was growing dissatisfaction with the capitalist system. The Great Depression had people questioning capitalism, so this makes sense. But was that the main draw for Long's movement?

Option C: Attracted by "every man being a king." That's the motto, but does that fully explain why people followed? It's catchy, but maybe the actual policies were more important.

Option D: Promised to limit the wealth of the rich and provide a minimum standard. This seems to capture the essence of the plan. It's about both limiting the top and ensuring a minimum for everyone, which would address the stark inequalities of the time.

Option E: Rise of technology creating demand for wealth distribution. I don't recall technology being a main factor here. The focus was more on the Depression's economic issues.

Option F: New Deal hadn't ended the Depression. Wait, the New Deal was ongoing in 1934, but I'm not sure if that's the direct reason. Maybe people were looking for alternatives because the New Deal wasn't acting fast enough.

Option G: WWII encouraging equality. No, WWII was in the 1940s, so this is too early.

Option H: Immigrant surge looking for equal wealth. I don't think that's relevant here. The movement was more about existing citizens affected by the Depression.

Option I: Flourishing economy and baby boom. No, 1934 was during the Depression, so the economy wasn't flourishing.

Option J: Socialist ideas becoming popular. Long's ideas were more populist than socialist, I think. But some might see it as moving towards socialism.

So, putting it together. The Share Our Wealth Society proposed both limiting the wealthy and ensuring a minimum standard. So option D seems to directly address the main reasons. It's about redistributive policies that appeal to those suffering during the Depression.

But wait, option B is about dissatisfaction with capitalism. The movement was a response to that dissatisfaction, but the question is why it attracted followers. The specific policies (D) would be the direct reason, while B is more of a contributing factor.

Alternatively, option F says the New Deal hadn't ended the Depression. If people were unhappy with the New Deal's progress, they might look for alternatives like Long's plan. But the question is about the appeal of Long's society itself, not the failure of others.

So I think the best answer is D. It directly addresses the core proposal of limiting the wealthy and providing for the poor, which would attract followers during hard times.

The "Share Our Wealth Society" attracted followers in 1934 primarily because it promised to limit the wealth of the rich and provide a minimum standard of living for everyone. During the Great Depression, widespread economic hardship made redistributive policies appealing, as they addressed the stark inequalities of the time by capping individual fortunes and ensuring basic necessities for families.
