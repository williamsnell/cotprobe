Question:

A man filed a federal diversity action against a bus company, seeking damages for injuries he had sustained in an accident while riding a bus owned by the company. The man demanded a jury trial. After the parties' attorneys examined the prospective jurors and exercised their challenges, six jurors and two alternate jurors were chosen. During the trial, two jurors became ill and were replaced by the alternate jurors. At the conclusion of replaced by the alternate jurors. At the conclusion of the trial, a third juror also became ill, and the court excused that juror. The parties' attorneys stipulated to the return of a verdict from a five-person jury. The jury then deliberated and returned a verdict for the company. The man timely filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the five-person jury was not large enough to return a verdict. Should the court grant the motion?

Options:

A: No, because the verdict was reached before the third juror was excused.
B: No, because the court properly excused the three jurors due to illness.
C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury.
D: Yes, because there must be at least 12 jurors on a federal civil jury.
E: Yes, because the replacement of jurors during the trial invalidated the verdict.
F: Yes, because the stipulation of the attorneys cannot override federal jury size requirements.
G: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer than six jurors.
H: No, because the illness of jurors is a valid reason for reducing the jury size.
I: No, because the remaining jurors were sufficient to reach a unanimous decision.
J: Yes, because the man was not given a fair trial due to the reduced jury size.

Okay, so I've got this question about federal civil procedure, specifically dealing with jury trials. Hmm, the scenario is a man suing a bus company for injuries. He filed a federal diversity action, which I remember means the case is in federal court because the parties are from different states and the amount in controversy is over a certain threshold.

He demanded a jury trial. So, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, I think a party can demand a jury trial in certain cases, like when there are issues of fact to be decided. Now, the question is about the composition of the jury.

The setup: After examining prospective jurors and using their challenges, six jurors and two alternates were chosen. Wait, so that's a total of eight people selected, but only six as the main jury and two as alternates. That makes sense because sometimes alternates replace jurors who can't continue during the trial.

During the trial, two jurors became ill and were replaced by the alternates. So now, we've used up both alternates, and the main jury is still at six because each alternate replaced an ill juror. So far, so good, right? But then, a third juror became ill, and the court excused that juror. Now, the jury has five members left. The parties' attorneys stipulated to the return of a verdict from this five-person jury. So they agreed to let the five decide.

The man is now moving for a new trial, arguing that a five-person jury isn't large enough. The question is whether the court should grant this motion.

I need to recall the federal rules about jury size. I remember that in federal civil cases, the jury is typically six persons, unless the parties agree to a smaller number. Oh wait, but is there a minimum? Let me think. I think the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow for a jury of at least six, but with stipulation, it can be fewer. Wait, no, wait. Let me be precise.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 48(b) says that a federal civil jury must have at least six persons. But wait, can they have fewer? Or is six the minimum, and you can't go below that without violating the rule. Because I remember that in some cases, if the parties agree, they can have a smaller jury, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. I think that under Rule 48(b), the court may order a jury of fewer than six if the parties stipulate. So if both parties agree, the jury can be as small as, say, five or even one, but that's unusual. But wait, I also remember that the Supreme Court has held that a jury in a civil case can't be less than six, unless the parties consent. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing with state rules.

Wait, no, the Federal Rules are clear. Rule 48(b) states: "When the jury has... been reduced to fewer than 6 members, the court may order a mistrial if the parties do not stipulate to continue with the remaining jurors."

Wait, no. Let me read the rule again as I remember it. Rule 48(b) says that if a jury is unable to reach a verdict, the court may discharge it. But more importantly, regarding the size, I think the key is Rule 39(c), which allows for the parties to stipulate to a jury of as few as six, but can they go lower? Or is six the minimum, and you can't go below?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Oh, wait, in federal civil cases, the standard is a jury of six, unless the parties agree to a smaller one. But if the parties agree, can the jury be smaller than six? Or is six the minimum and you can't go below that without violating the rule.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Supreme Court case of Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.S. 149 (1973), held that a six-person jury was constitutional in civil cases. But that doesn't directly answer the question of whether fewer than six is allowed.

Wait, but Rule 48(b) says that after the jury has been sworn, if any juror is unable to continue, the court may excuse that juror and proceed with the remaining jurors. But if the number of jurors drops below six, the court must discharge the jury unless the parties stipulate to continue with fewer.

So, if after the jury is sworn, and some jurors are excused, and the count goes below six, the court can only proceed if the parties agree. So in this case, the jury started with six, then two became ill and were replaced by alternates, so still six. Then a third became ill, making it five. The parties stipulated to continue with five. So under Rule 48(b), that's allowed.

But wait, the man is arguing that a five-person jury is not large enough. So does federal law allow a jury of five in a civil case when the parties agree? Or is there a minimum of six?

Wait, the initial setup was a jury of six selected, so it's a six-person jury. Then, after excusing one, it's five, but only with the parties' agreement. So according to Rule 48(b), that's permissible.

Wait, but is there a minimum size? I thought that the minimum is six, but if parties agree, maybe they can go lower. But I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps the minimum is six, and you can't have a jury smaller than that, even with stipulation.

Wait, the man's argument is that five isn't enough. So if the law requires at least six, his motion should be granted. But if the law allows for fewer with stipulation, then the court's decision stands.

Looking back at the rules, Rule 39(c) allows a jury of any number agreed to by the parties, but the minimum is six. Wait, no, Rule 39(c) says that "a jury may be waived and the trial conducted by the court... as provided in Rule 38." Wait, no. Alternatively, I think Rule 48(b) is the one that says that if the jury is reduced below six, the court may discharge it unless the parties stipulate.

Wait, so the rule is that in a civil case, the jury can be as small as six, but the parties can agree to a smaller size. So if the parties stipulate, even to five, the court can proceed.

In this case, the parties did stipulate. So the verdict from five should be valid. Therefore, the court should deny the motion for a new trial.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial jury is six. Two jurors become ill, replaced by alternates, so still six. Then a third becomes ill, so five. The parties agree to proceed. So under Rule 48(b), that's acceptable.

So the court should not grant the motion. Therefore, the answer would be either A, B, G, H, or I.

Looking at the options:

A: No, because the verdict was reached before the third juror was excused. Wait, no, the verdict was after the third was excused because the verdict was after the five remained. So A is not correct.

B: No, because the court properly excused the three jurors due to illness. Well, the first two were replaced by alternates, so no, only the third was excused, not three total. So B is incorrect.

C: Yes, because there must be at least six jurors on a federal civil jury. So if the minimum is six, then the answer would be yes, but if parties can stipulate to fewer, then C is incorrect.

D: Yes, because 12 jurors are required. No, federal civil juries are six, so D is wrong.

E: Yes, because replacing jurors invalidated the verdict. But replacing with alternates is standard, so E is incorrect.

F: Yes, because the stipulation cannot override federal requirements. So if the federal rule requires at least six, then F would be correct. But if the rule allows stipulation to fewer, then F is wrong.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall the exact rules. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 48(b) says: "When the jury has been sworn, the court must discharge it if the jury cannot reach a verdict. If the jury is discharged without reaching a verdict, the court may order a new trial. If 6 or fewer jurors are left, whether because of excusal, sickness, or other reason, the court may order a mistrial if the parties do not stipulate to continue with the remaining jurors."

So, if the jury drops below six, the court may order a mistrial unless the parties agree to continue. So in this case, the parties stipulated to continue with five, so it's allowed.

Therefore, the court's decision to allow the five-person jury is valid. So the man's motion for a new trial should be denied.

Looking back at the options, F says "Yes, because the stipulation cannot override federal jury size requirements." But according to Rule 48(b), the stipulation can allow the court to proceed with fewer than six. So F is incorrect.

Option G: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from fewer than six. So G says the parties agreed, so it's okay. So G would be correct.

Wait, but another point: the initial jury was six, but when one more was excused, making it five, and the parties agreed. So the stipulation allowed the five to decide.

So the correct answer would be either G or another option that reflects that the parties stipulated, making it acceptable.

Looking at the options:

G: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer than six jurors.

So the answer would be G.

Wait, but I thought the initial jury was six, so when it's reduced to five, the parties can stipulate. So G is correct.

But wait, another thought: the man demanded a jury trial. If the jury size is reduced below what is required, does that violate the Seventh Amendment? I think the Seventh Amendment requires a jury in civil cases, but doesn't specify the size. The Supreme Court has held that a six-person jury is constitutional, but does it require at least six, or can it be less with consent?

In the case of a civil trial, the Seventh Amendment doesn't mandate a specific jury size, but traditionally, juries were twelve, but the Supreme Court has upheld six-person juries. However, I think that the Seventh Amendment does not prohibit smaller juries if the parties consent. So if the parties agree, a five-person jury would be acceptable.

So, in this scenario, the parties stipulated, so it's okay. Therefore, the court should not grant the motion. So the correct answer is G: No, because the parties stipulated.

Wait, but another option is F: Yes, because the stipulation cannot override federal jury size requirements. But if the federal rules allow for a stipulation to a smaller jury, then F is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the federal rules set a minimum of six, and you can't go lower even with stipulation. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, from what I remember, in federal civil cases, the jury can be as small as one if the parties agree, but that's rare. But the usual minimum is six unless the parties agree to a smaller number.

So, in this case, since the parties agreed to proceed with five, it's permissible, so the motion should be denied.

So, looking at the options, G is the correct answer: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer than six.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option F says the stipulation cannot override federal requirements. If federal rules allow for stipulation to smaller juries, then F is incorrect.

Another angle: the man demanded a jury trial. Does that mean he's entitled to a jury of a certain size, regardless of stipulation? Or can his attorney stipulate on his behalf.

Wait, but in this case, the man's attorney stipulated. So perhaps he's bound by that stipulation. But if the attorney doesn't have authority to stipulate to a jury size that's below the required minimum, then the stipulation would be invalid.

But I think that under the rules, the parties can stipulate to a smaller jury, so the attorney's stipulation is valid. Therefore, the court's decision stands.

So, the answer should be G: No, because the parties stipulated.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because some sources say that in federal civil cases, the jury must consist of at least six persons unless the parties agree otherwise. So, the parties can agree to a smaller jury.

In this case, the parties did agree, so it's okay. Therefore, the man's motion should be denied.

So the correct answer is G.

Wait, but another option is F, which says the stipulation cannot override federal requirements. If the federal requirement is a minimum of six, then F would be correct. So which is it?

Wait, let me check Rule 48(b) again. It says, "When the jury has been sworn, the court may discharge it if the jury cannot reach a verdict. If the jury is discharged without reaching a verdict, the court may order a new trial. If 6 or fewer jurors are left, whether because of excusal, sickness, or other reason, the court may order a mistrial if the parties do not stipulate to continue with the remaining jurors."

So, if the remaining jurors are fewer than six, the court may order a mistrial unless the parties stipulate. So, the parties can agree to proceed with fewer than six, meaning that the federal rules allow it. Therefore, the stipulation is valid, and the court can proceed. So the answer is G.

Thus, the correct answer is G: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer than six jurors.

In this case, the man filed a federal diversity action against a bus company and demanded a jury trial. A jury of six members and two alternate jurors was initially selected. During the trial, two jurors became ill and were replaced by the alternate jurors, maintaining a six-person jury. Later, a third juror became ill, reducing the jury to five members. The parties' attorneys stipulated to allow the five-person jury to return a verdict. The man now argues that a five-person jury was insufficient under federal law.

Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 48(b), a federal civil jury must have at least six members. However, if the number of jurors falls below six due to excusal, sickness, or other reasons, the court may proceed with the remaining jurors if the parties stipulate to continue. In this case, the parties agreed to proceed with a five-person jury, which is permissible under the rule. The Seventh Amendment does not mandate a specific jury size in civil cases, and the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of six-person juries. Additionally, the parties' stipulation to proceed with five jurors is valid and binding.

Given that the parties stipulated to continue with a five-person jury, the court's decision to allow the verdict stands. Therefore, the motion for a new trial should be denied.

The correct answer is **G: No, because the parties stipulated to a verdict from a jury of fewer than six jurors.**

**Answer: G**
