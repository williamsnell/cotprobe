Question:

A first-grade teacher is planning activities to introduce students to nonstandard units of measurement. Which of the following activities will best meet the teacher's goal?

Options:

A: Asking students to use pencils to measure the length of a desk
B: Asking students to use a digital scale to weigh their lunch box
C: Asking students to use a measuring tape to measure the length of the classroom door
D: Asking students to use a ruler to measure the length of a book
E: Asking students to determine how many one-liter bottles of water can fill a onegallon container
F: Asking students to stand in a line, from the shortest person to the tallest

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about nonstandard units of measurement for first-grade students. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the question is asking which activity would best introduce students to nonstandard units. Nonstandard units are things that aren't your typical rulers or measuring tapes. They're more like everyday objects that can be used to measure things.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Using pencils to measure the length of a desk. Pencils aren't standard measuring tools, so this makes sense. It's a simple object that students are familiar with, and using it to measure something bigger like a desk would be a good way to show how nonstandard units work.

Option B: Using a digital scale to weigh a lunch box. A digital scale is a standard tool for measuring weight, so this doesn't fit the nonstandard category. The question is about introducing nonstandard units, so B is probably not the right choice.

Option C: Using a measuring tape for the classroom door. Measuring tapes are standard, so this is out. It's the opposite of what the teacher wants.

Option D: Ruler to measure a book's length. Again, a ruler is a standard unit. So D isn't correct.

Option E: One-liter bottles filling a gallon container. This involves volume, but it's using standard units (liters and gallons). It's more about converting units rather than using nonstandard ones, so E might not be the best fit.

Option F: Students lining up by height. This is more about comparing heights, not really using a unit to measure. It's a way to order but doesn't involve a measuring tool or object, so probably not the right choice.

So the only option that uses a nonstandard unit is A. Using pencils to measure the desk's length. Pencils are everyday items, and measuring with them would help students understand that measurement doesn't have to be with traditional tools.

The activity that best introduces students to nonstandard units of measurement is using pencils to measure the length of a desk. This approach uses an everyday object as a measuring tool, effectively demonstrating nonstandard measurement.

Answer: A
