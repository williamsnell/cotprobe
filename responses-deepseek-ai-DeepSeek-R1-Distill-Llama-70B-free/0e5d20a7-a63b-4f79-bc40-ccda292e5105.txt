Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out when two slightly different starting values diverge by more than 30% when using a specific function. The function is given as x_{n+1} = α * x_n * (1 - x_n²), with α set to 2.5. The starting points are 0.9000000 and 0.9000001. 

Hmm, I remember that this kind of function is probably a logistic map or something similar. These kinds of functions can show chaotic behavior, especially when α is high enough. Since α is 2.5 here, which I think is above the chaos threshold for the logistic map—wait, no, the standard logistic map uses r, where chaos starts around r=3.0, but maybe this is a different scaling.

Wait, maybe I should think about how the function behaves. So each step, x_{n+1} depends on x_n in a nonlinear way because of the x_n squared term. Even a tiny difference in x_1 could lead to the two sequences diverging over time. That's the butterfly effect, right?

The question is asking me to find the smallest n where the two x_n values differ by more than 30%. So I need to simulate both starting points step by step and compare their values at each n until the difference exceeds 30%.

Wait, but doing this manually for each step up to, say, 40 steps would take a long time. Maybe I can find a pattern or perhaps the number of steps needed for the difference to grow beyond 30% is around the options given (25 to 40).

I think the initial difference between the two x1 values is 0.0000001. Let's call them x=0.9 and x=0.9000001. Since the function is x_{n+1} = 2.5 * x_n * (1 - x_n²), each step could amplify small differences.

Let me try to compute the first few steps for both. Maybe I can see a pattern or find when the 30% difference occurs.

Step 1:
For x=0.9:
x1 = 0.9
x2 = 2.5 * 0.9 * (1 - 0.9²) 
0.9 squared is 0.81, so 1-0.81=0.19. 
So x2 = 2.5 * 0.9 * 0.19 = let me calculate that. 0.9 * 0.19 is 0.171. Multiply by 2.5 gives 0.4275.

For x=0.9000001:
x1=0.9000001
x2 =2.5 * 0.9000001 * (1 - (0.9000001)^2)
Calculate (0.9000001)^2: it's approximately 0.81 + 2*0.9*0.0000001 + (0.0000001)^2, but since the last term is negligible, it's about 0.81 + 0.00000018 = 0.81000018.
So 1 - that is 0.18999982.
Multiply by 0.9000001: 0.9000001 * 0.18999982 ≈ let's see, 0.9 * 0.19 is 0.171, but the exact calculation would be 0.9000001 * 0.18999982. Maybe approximate as 0.17100000... wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the difference.

The initial x1 values differ by 1e-7. Let me compute the difference in x2.

x2 for 0.9 is 0.4275.
x2 for 0.9000001 would be 2.5 * 0.9000001 * (1 - (0.9000001)^2). Let's compute (0.9000001)^2 exactly: (0.9 + 1e-7)^2 = 0.81 + 2*(0.9)*(1e-7) + (1e-7)^2 = 0.81 + 1.8e-7 + 1e-14 ≈ 0.81000018.

So 1 - that is 0.18999982.

Then x2 = 2.5 * 0.9000001 * 0.18999982.

Let me compute 0.9000001 * 0.18999982 first. Hmm.

0.9 * 0.18999982 is 0.171, but the exact value is:

0.9000001 * 0.18999982 = (0.9 + 1e-7) * (0.18999982) 

= 0.9 * 0.18999982 + 1e-7 * 0.18999982 

= 0.171, let's compute more accurately.

Wait, 0.9 * 0.18999982 = 0.9 * 0.18 is 0.162, 0.9 * 0.00999982 is 0.008999538. So total is 0.171 + 0.000000? Wait, perhaps my approach is making this too complicated. Alternatively, maybe think in terms of the difference between x2 for the two cases.

Let me denote x1 = 0.9, x1' = 0.9000001. The difference is dx1 = 1e-7.

Then x2 = 2.5 x1 (1 - x1²) 
x2' = 2.5 x1' (1 - (x1')²)

The difference dx2 = x2' - x2.

But expanding, maybe using a linear approximation (Taylor expansion) for small dx1.

So, dx2 ≈ 2.5 [ (x1 + dx1) (1 - (x1 + dx1)^2 ) - x1 (1 - x1²) ]

Simplify this:

= 2.5 [ x1(1 - x1²) + dx1(1 - x1²) - x1*(2 x1 dx1) ) - x1(1 -x1²) ]

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the derivative of the function f(x) = α x (1 -x²). The derivative f’(x) = α (1 - x²) + α x (-2x) )= α (1 -x² - 2x²) = α (1 -3x²).

So, the change in x after each step is approximately given by dx_{n+1} ≈ f’(x_n) * dx_n.

So if the initial difference is dx1 = 1e-7, then at each step, the difference is multiplied by |f’(x_n)|.

So dx2 ≈ f’(x1) * dx1.

If we can track how the difference grows, we can find when it becomes larger than 0.3 times the current x_n (since the question states divergence by more than 30%).

Wait, but wait, the question says "diverge by more than 30%". So when |x'_n - x_n| / x_n > 0.3, perhaps. Or maybe it's the absolute difference is 30% of one of the values. Wait, the question says "diverge by more than 30%", so perhaps the absolute difference between x and x' is more than 30% of the average or one of the values.

Alternatively, perhaps it's when the relative difference is more than 30%—so |(x' -x)/x| > 0.3.

But perhaps the problem states that the two values differ by more than 30% in their magnitudes. So, for each n, compute x_n and x'_n, and find when |x'_n - x_n| > 0.3 * min(x_n, x'_n), or perhaps when |x'_n - x_n| / (x_n) > 0.3.

Wait, but the problem isn't entirely clear. Alternatively, perhaps it's when the two values differ by more than 30 percentage points in their ratio. So (x' /x) > 1.3 or <0.7.

Hmm, perhaps the exact definition is needed, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, it's when the absolute difference is more than 30% of one of the values.

But maybe to proceed, I can model the growth of the difference using the derivative.

So, the idea is that the difference dx_n grows by a factor of |f’(x_n)| each step. So:

dx_{n+1} ≈ |f’(x_n)| * dx_n.

Since f’(x) = α (1 - 3x^2).

Given α=2.5, so f’(x)= 2.5 (1 -3x²).

We start with x1=0.9, so f’(x1) = 2.5 (1 - 3*(0.9)^2 ) = 2.5 (1 - 3*0.81) = 2.5 (1-2.43) = 2.5 (-1.43) = -3.575.

So the magnitude is 3.575. So the difference dx grows by about 3.575 each step, but let's see.

Wait, but wait—this is only valid if the system is near x1, and as x changes, the derivative changes as well. So the approximation is only good for the first few steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps have a rapidly increasing difference, but after some steps, the behavior could change as x approaches different regions where |f’(x)| is smaller.

But maybe in this case, since α is 2.5 and x starts at 0.9, let's compute f’(x1)=3.575 as above. So the magnitude is 3.575, so each step, the difference is multiplied by about 3.575. So dx grows exponentially.

Wait, but let's compute a few steps manually.

Starting with x1=0.9 and x1'=0.9000001.

Compute x2 and x2' as before.

x2 = 2.5 * 0.9 * (1 - 0.81) = 2.5 * 0.9 * 0.19 = 0.4275.

x2' = 2.5 * 0.9000001 * (1 - (0.9000001)^2 )

Calculate (0.9000001)^2 = 0.81 + 2*(0.9)*(0.0000001) + (0.0000001)^2 = 0.81 + 0.00000018 + 1e-14 ≈ 0.81000018.

So 1 - that is 0.18999982.

So x2' = 2.5 * 0.9000001 * 0.18999982.

Let me compute 0.9000001 * 0.18999982.

0.9 * 0.18999982 = 0.171, but precisely:

0.18999982 = 0.19 - 0.00000018.

So 0.9 * 0.19 is 0.171, 0.9*(-0.00000018)= -0.000000162. So 0.171 - 0.000000162 = 0.170999838.

Then multiply by 0.9000001:

Wait, no. Wait, 0.9000001 is 0.9 + 1e-7.

So (0.9 + 1e-7) * 0.18999982 = 0.9 * 0.18999982 + 1e-7 * 0.18999982.

We already have 0.9 * 0.18999982 ≈ 0.170999838.

Then 1e-7 * 0.18999982 ≈ 1.8999982e-8.

So total is approximately 0.170999838 + 0.000000018999982 ≈ 0.171000, but perhaps more precisely 0.171000018999982.

Wait, wait, no, 0.170999838 is 0.171 - 0.000000162. Adding 0.000000018999982 gives 0.171 - 0.000000162 + 0.000000018999982 = 0.171 - 0.000000143017018 ≈ 0.170999856982982.

So approximately 0.170999857.

Multiply by 2.5: 0.170999857 * 2.5 = 0.4274996425.

So x2 is 0.4275, x2' is approximately 0.4274996425.

So the difference dx2 = x2' - x2 = 0.4274996425 - 0.4275 = -0.0000003575.

Wait, but that's a difference of about -3.575e-7, which is larger in magnitude than the initial difference of 1e-7. So |dx2| is 3.575e-7, which is 3.575 times the initial difference. So as expected, the growth factor is about 3.575, which matches the derivative's magnitude.

So dx grows by a factor of ~3.575 each step.

But wait, the growth factor might change as x changes, because f’(x) depends on x.

So let's compute the next step for x2 and x2'.

x2 is 0.4275.

Compute x3 = 2.5 * x2 * (1 - x2^2).

x2^2 = (0.4275)^2 = let's compute that. 0.4^2=0.16, 0.0275^2≈0.000756, cross terms 2*0.4*0.0275=0.022. So 0.4275^2 ≈ 0.16 + 0.022 + 0.000756 ≈ 0.182756.

So 1 - x2² ≈ 0.817244.

Then x3 = 2.5 * 0.4275 * 0.817244.

0.4275 * 0.817244 ≈ 0.4275 * 0.8 = 0.342, 0.4275 * 0.017244≈ ~0.4275 * 0.017 = approx 0.00727, so total ≈ 0.342 + 0.00727 ≈ 0.34927.

Multiply by 2.5: 0.34927 * 2.5 ≈ 0.873175.

So x3 ≈ 0.873175.

Now, what about x2' which was 0.4274996425.

Compute x3' = 2.5 * x2' * (1 - (x2')²).

x2' is 0.4274996425. Compute (x2')^2:

0.4275^2 is 0.182756, as before. Now, since x2' is 0.4275 - 0.0000003575, the square is (0.4275 - δ)^2 = 0.4275² - 2*0.4275*δ + δ².

δ is 0.0000003575.

So (x2')² ≈ 0.182756 - 2*0.4275 * 0.0000003575 + (0.0000003575)^2.

Compute each term:

2*0.4275 = 0.855.

0.855 * 0.0000003575 = approximately 0.0000003056.

So (x2')² ≈ 0.182756 - 0.0000003056 = 0.1827556944.

So 1 - (x2')² ≈ 0.8172443056.

Now, x2' * (1 - (x2')²) = 0.4274996425 * 0.8172443056.

Multiply 0.4275 * 0.8172443056.

We can approximate it as 0.4275 * 0.817244 = let's compute:

0.4 * 0.817244 = 0.3268976.

0.0275 * 0.817244 ≈ 0.02245305.

So total ≈ 0.3268976 + 0.02245305 ≈ 0.34935065.

But since x2' is 0.4274996425, which is 0.4275 - 0.0000003575, so the product would be:

(0.4275 - 0.0000003575) * (0.8172443056) ≈ 0.4275 * 0.8172443056 - 0.0000003575 * 0.8172443056.

We have 0.4275 * 0.8172443056 ≈ 0.34935065 (as above).

The second term is 0.0000003575 * 0.8172443056 ≈ 2.919e-7.

So the product is approximately 0.34935065 - 0.0000002919 ≈ 0.349350358.

Multiply by 2.5: 0.349350358 * 2.5 ≈ 0.873376.

So x3' ≈ 0.873376.

The difference dx3 = x3' - x3 ≈ 0.873376 - 0.873175 = 0.000201.

But wait, let me compute that again. Wait, x3 is 0.873175, x3' is 0.873376. So dx3 = 0.873376 - 0.873175 = 0.000201.

Wait, that's a difference of 0.000201, which is about 2e-4. But wait, earlier, the difference was about 3.5e-7 at n=2, and now it's 2e-4. That's a jump by a factor of about 57. So perhaps the growth factor is higher in this step.

Wait, but wait, the function's derivative at x2 is f'(x2) = 2.5*(1 - 3*(0.4275)^2).

Compute 0.4275 squared: 0.4275^2 = 0.18275625.

So 1 - 3*(0.18275625) = 1 - 0.54826875 = 0.45173125.

So f'(x2) = 2.5 * 0.45173125 ≈
