Question:

A state enacted a statute making it illegal to knowingly sell, purchase, or in anyway distribute any form of tobacco to a minor. Violation of the statute was a misdemeanor punishable by a $500 fine and up to 30 days in jail. After the statute's enactment, a defendant sold a pack of cigarettes to a girl who was 17 years of age. Before selling the product to the girl, the defendant carefully examined the girl's driver's license, which indicated that she was, in fact, 17 years old. The defendant nevertheless made the sale because he erroneously believed the age of majority to be 17. The defendant is subsequently charged with violation of the statute, and his mistake is honestly held to have been made. Such a mistake should

Options:

A: not prevent his conviction, because the crime imposes absolute criminal liability.
B: result in his acquittal, because the girl presented a false identity.
C: not prevent his conviction, because he intentionally sold the cigarettes.
D: not prevent his conviction, because he had previous knowledge of the law.
E: result in his acquittal, because he did not possess the requisite mens rea.
F: not prevent his conviction, because the age of majority is 18, not 17.
G: result in his acquittal, because he took reasonable steps to ascertain the girl's age.
H: result in his acquittal, because he honestly made a mistake.
I: result in his acquittal, because the statute was not clearly defined.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with mistake of fact and how it affects criminal liability. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question states that a state enacted a statute making it illegal to sell, purchase, or distribute tobacco to a minor. The punishment is a $500 fine and up to 30 days in jail, which is a misdemeanor. The defendant sold cigarettes to a 17-year-old girl. He checked her driver's license, which showed she was 17, but he believed the age of majority was 17, so he sold them anyway. Now, he's charged with violating the statute. His mistake was honest, and the question is whether this mistake should prevent his conviction.

I remember that in criminal law, the mens rea (the criminal intent) is a crucial element. Some crimes require specific intent, while others are strict liability offenses where intent isn't necessary. 

So, first, I need to figure out what kind of crime this statute is creating. The statute makes it a misdemeanor to sell tobacco to a minor. The elements here would be knowingly selling to a minor. The word "knowingly" usually implies that the defendant was aware of the circumstances, so it's a mens rea requirement. 

But wait, sometimes even if a crime requires knowledge, certain mistakes might not excuse the behavior. For instance, a mistake about the law is generally not a defense. But a mistake about a fact might be, depending on the situation.

In this case, the defendant made a mistake about the law. He thought the age of majority was 17, so he believed she was an adult. But the law actually sets the age higher, at 18. So he sold to a minor because of this mistake.

But wait, the statute says "knowingly sell... to a minor." So the defendant must have known that the person was a minor. If he mistakenly believed she wasn't a minor, then he didn't have the mens rea for that element.

Wait, but he did check her driver's license and saw she was 17. So he knew her age was 17, but because he thought 17 was the age of majority, he thought it was legal. So he didn't think she was a minor. 

So the question is whether his mistake about the legal status (whether 17 is a minor) affects the mens rea. Because he knew her age but misunderstood the law, does that negate the mens rea required?

In other words, the crime requires that he knowingly sold to a minor. If he didn't know she was a minor because he thought 17 wasn't a minor, then he lacked the required mens rea. 

But wait, another angle: strict liability crimes don't require mens rea. If this is a strict liability offense, then even a mistake wouldn't matter. But the statute uses the word "knowingly," which suggests it's not strict liability. So the prosecution must prove that the defendant knew the person was a minor.

So if the defendant didn't know she was a minor because of his mistake, then he didn't have the necessary intent. So his mistake would negate the mens rea, leading to acquittal.

Looking at the options, option E says "result in his acquittal because he did not possess the requisite mens rea." That sounds right.

But wait, let me think again. If the crime requires that the defendant knew the person was under 18 (a minor), and he checked her ID which said 17, then he actually did know her age. So perhaps he did know she was a minor, but he had a mistaken belief about the law. 

Wait, no. Because 'minor' is defined by law as under 18. So if he thought the age of majority was 17, he wouldn't think she's a minor. So his mistake is about the legal definition, not about her age. 

So in this case, he knew her age but didn't realize that 17 was below the age of majority. So he didn't know she was a minor in the eyes of the law. Therefore, he lacked the mens rea for that element of the crime. 

So the answer would be E. 

Wait, another thought: is the crime one of strict liability? The use of "knowingly" suggests it's not. So it's a specific intent crime where the defendant must know the person is a minor. Therefore, his mistake about what constitutes a minor would negate that knowledge.

Alternatively, if the crime were strict liability, then his knowledge of her age wouldn't matter, but the statute requires that the sale was knowing. So it's not strict liability.

So the correct reasoning is that his mistake negates the mens rea, so he should be acquitted. Therefore, the answer is E.

The question revolves around whether the defendant's honest mistake about the legal age of majority (believing it to be 17 instead of 18) should prevent his conviction for selling tobacco to a 17-year-old girl. The statute in question makes it a misdemeanor to "knowingly" sell tobacco to a minor, which implies that the prosecution must prove the defendant had the requisite mens rea (criminal intent) to commit the crime.

The defendant checked the girl's driver's license, which indicated she was 17, and mistakenly believed that 17 was the age of majority. This mistake pertains to the legal definition of a minor, not the girl's actual age. Since the statute requires the defendant to "knowingly" sell to a minor, the prosecution must prove that the defendant knew the girl was under the legal age of majority (18). The defendant's honest mistake about the legal age of majority negates the required mens rea, as he did not knowingly sell to a minor in the eyes of the law.

Given that the statute is not a strict liability offense (due to the use of "knowingly"), the defendant's lack of intent to sell to a minor means his conviction should be prevented. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: result in his acquittal, because he did not possess the requisite mens rea.

Answer: E
