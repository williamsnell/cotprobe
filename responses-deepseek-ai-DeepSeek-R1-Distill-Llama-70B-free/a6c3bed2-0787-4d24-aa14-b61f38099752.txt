Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. White and a loan he took from ABC Loan Company. I'm a bit new to this kind of stuff, but I'll try to figure it out step by step.

Alright, let's read the problem again. Mr. White received $972.50, and he agreed to pay back $1000 after 180 days. I need to find the discount rate of the loan. The options are given from A to J, so I need to calculate the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that discount rate means the interest is deducted upfront. So the amount he received is the present value, and the amount he has to pay back is the future value. The difference between the two is the interest, which is the discount.

Wait, so the formula I think is: Present Value (PV) = Future Value (FV) / (1 + rate * time). But wait, time in years, right? So 180 days is half a year, so 0.5 years.

Let me write down the numbers. PV is $972.50, FV is $1000, and time is 0.5 years. We're solving for the rate.

So plugging into the formula: 972.50 = 1000 / (1 + r*0.5). Let me rearrange this to solve for r.

First, divide both sides by 1000. Wait, no, actually, I can rearrange the equation as (1 + r*0.5) = 1000 / 972.50.

Calculating 1000 divided by 972.50. Let me do that: 1000 / 972.50 ≈ 1.02827. So 1 + r*0.5 = 1.02827.

Subtracting 1 from both sides: r * 0.5 = 0.02827. So r = 0.02827 / 0.5 = 0.05654.

Wait, 0.05654 is about 5.654%. But wait, the time here is 0.5 years, so is this a rate per year? Because the options are mostly per year, except option D which is per six months.

So the rate I calculated is for the six months period, right? No, wait, because we used 0.5 years, so the rate is annual. Because the formula uses time in years. So 5.654% per year.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.5% per year, and option E is 9%. Hmm. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation or the approach.

Wait another thought: the discount is the amount he didn't receive. So the discount would be 1000 - 972.50 = $27.50. So the interest is $27.50 on a principal of $972.50 for 180 days.

Wait, is that correct? Or is the principal $1000 and the discount is $27.50? Hmm, I think I might be mixing things up here.

Wait, the discount method: the present value is the amount received now, and the future value is the amount to be paid back. So the interest is FV - PV = 1000 - 972.50 = 27.50. So the interest is $27.50.

So the formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t. Wait, but is it simple interest? Because sometimes loans might use simple interest.

Wait, I think when calculating discount rates, it's often simple interest. So I = P * r * t.

Wait, but wait, in the discount method, the present value is PV = FV - D, where D is the discount (interest). So D = FV - PV = 1000 - 972.50 = 27.50.

So in that case, using simple interest formula: D = P * r * t. But wait, what's the principal here? Is it the present value or the face value?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. In the discount method, the interest is calculated on the face value (the amount to be paid back) but only for the time period. So perhaps D = FV * r * t.

Wait, that would make sense. So D is $27.50, FV is $1000, t is 180 days. Let me convert that to years: 180/365 ≈ 0.493 years, roughly 0.5 years.

So 27.50 = 1000 * r * (180/365). Let me compute 180/365 first. Since 180 is about half a year, approximately 0.4918 years.

So 27.50 = 1000 * r * 0.4918. Let's solve for r.

r = 27.50 / (1000 * 0.4918) = 27.50 / 491.8 ≈ 0.0559 or 5.59% per year.

Wait, that's close to 5.5%, which is option C, but earlier when I used the present value formula, I got approximately 5.65%. There's a slight discrepancy here, maybe because of using 0.5 instead of the exact 180/365.

Let me do the exact calculation with 180/365. So 180/365 is approximately 0.49315.

So using the first method: PV = FV / (1 + r * t).

972.50 = 1000 / (1 + r * 0.49315).

So 1 + r * 0.49315 = 1000/972.50 ≈ 1.02827.

So r * 0.49315 = 0.02827 → r = 0.02827 / 0.49315 ≈ 0.05735 or 5.735% per year.

Hmm, so that's about 5.735%, which is approximately 5.74%. Looking at the options, option C is 5.5%, E is 9%, so neither is exactly 5.74.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation with more precise numbers.

Wait, 1000 / 972.50 = 1.02827. So 1 + r * (180/365) = 1.02827.

So r*(180/365) = 0.02827 → r = 0.02827 * (365/180) → Let's compute 0.02827 * (365/180).

Compute 365/180 first: 365 ÷ 180 ≈ 2.02778.

So 0.02827 * 2.02778 ≈ 0.05735, which is 5.735%.

So that's about 5.74% per year. But the options don't have exactly that. The closest is option C, which is 5.5% per year.

But wait, another approach: perhaps they consider the time as 180 days, which is exactly half a year, so 0.5 years.

So let me recalculate with t=0.5.

r = 0.02827 / 0.5 → 0.05654, which is 5.654% per year. So about 5.65%, which is still closer to 5.5% or 5.75%. But the options don't have 5.65%.

Wait, looking at the options:

Options are:

A: 2.75% per year

B:7.5

C:5.5

D:5.0% per six months (so that's 10% annualized?)

E:9

F:4.5

G:6.5

H:8

I:4.0

J:3.0

So the closest is option C:5.5%, but my calculation says 5.65%. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the simple interest formula, where the interest is $27.50, which is the discount.

So I = P * r * t. But is P the present value or the future value?

Wait, in discounting, the interest is calculated on the face value (FV). So I = FV * r * t.

So 27.50 = 1000 * r * (180/365).

Let me compute r: 27.50 / (1000 * (180/365)).

Compute denominator: 1000 * (180/365) → 1000 * 0.49315 ≈ 493.15.

So 27.50 / 493.15 ≈ 0.05575 → 5.575%, which is about 5.58% per year.

That's approximately 5.58%, so still close to 5.5% or 5.75%.

Wait, but the options don't have 5.75%. So perhaps the answer is option C:5.5% per year.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate using simple interest without compounding, so using the formula:

Rate = (Interest / Principal) / Time.

But again, the principal here would be the face value, I think.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula for discount rate as (D / FV) * (365 / t), where D is the discount.

So D is $27.50, FV is $1000, t is 180 days.

So discount rate = (27.50 / 1000) * (365 / 180) * 100.

Let me compute that.

27.50 / 1000 = 0.0275.

365 / 180 ≈ 2.02778.

Multiply: 0.0275 * 2.02778 ≈ 0.05575 → 5.575%.

Again, same as before, which is about 5.58%.

So the options don't have 5.58, but option C is 5.5% and option G is 6.5%.

Wait, perhaps the question is using 180 days as half a year, so using t=0.5, then the rate is 5.65%, which is about 5.7%.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option that gives the correct present value when used in the formula.

Let's try option C:5.5% per year.

So r is 5.5%, t is 0.5 years.

So PV = FV / (1 + r*t) → 1000 / (1 + 0.055*0.5) = 1000 / (1 + 0.0275) = 1000 /1.0275 ≈ 973.72.

But the actual PV is 972.50, which is a bit lower. So the rate must be a bit higher than 5.5%.

Wait, so let's try option E:9% per year. Wait, that seems high.

Wait, option G is 6.5% per year.

Let me compute PV with 6.5% and t=0.5.

PV = 1000/(1 + 0.065*0.5) = 1000/(1 +0.0325)=1000/1.0325≈969.07. Hmm, that's lower than 972.50, so the rate is lower than 6.5%.

Wait, so the correct rate is between 5.5% and 6.5%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: perhaps the interest is calculated on the present value (the amount received) instead of the future value.

So I = PV * r * t.

Then, I = 972.50 * r * 0.5 = 27.50.

So r = 27.50 / (972.50 * 0.5) → 27.50 / 486.25 ≈ 0.0565 → 5.65% per year.

Again, same as before. So perhaps the closest option is 5.5%, which is option C.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, option D is 5.0% per six months. So that would be 10% per year, which is higher than what we calculated.

Option B is 7.5% per year. Hmm.

So perhaps the correct answer is not exactly present, but the closest is option C:5.5% per year.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the discount rate is calculated differently, like using 360 days instead of 365.

Let me try that. So time in years would be 180/360=0.5 years.

So using the same formula:

D = FV * r * t → 27.50 = 1000 * r * 0.5 → r = 27.50 / (1000 * 0.5) = 27.50 / 500 = 0.055 → 5.5% per year.

Ah, so that gives exactly 5.5% per year. So that would match option C.

Wait, because when using 360 days in a year, 180 days is exactly half a year. So with that assumption, the calculation becomes exact.

So in that case, the discount rate is 5.5% per year → option C.

To determine the discount rate of the loan, we analyze the given data:

- **Present Value (PV):** $972.50 (the amount Mr. White received).
- **Future Value (FV):** $1,000 (the amount Mr. White will pay back).
- **Time:** 180 days, which is equivalent to 0.5 years (or 180/360 = 0.5 if using a 360-day year).

The discount rate is calculated using the formula:

\[
PV = \frac{FV}{1 + r \cdot t}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( r \):

\[
1 + r \cdot t = \frac{FV}{PV}
\]

\[
r \cdot t = \frac{FV}{PV} - 1
\]

\[
r = \frac{\frac{FV}{PV} - 1}{t}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
r = \frac{\frac{1000}{972.50} - 1}{0.5}
\]

\[
r = \frac{1.02827 - 1}{0.5} = \frac{0.02827}{0.5} = 0.05654 \, \text{or} \, 5.654\% \, \text{per year}.
\]

This calculation shows the discount rate is approximately **5.654% per year**.

To verify, we can also calculate the interest as the difference between the future value and the present value:

\[
\text{Interest (Discount)} = FV - PV = 1000 - 972.50 = 27.50
\]

Using the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot r \cdot t
\]

Here, \( P \) is the future value (\$1,000), \( t \) is 0.5 years, and \( I \) is \$27.50. Solving for \( r \):

\[
r = \frac{I}{P \cdot t} = \frac{27.50}{1000 \cdot 0.5} = \frac{27.50}{500} = 0.055 \, \text{or} \, 5.5\% \, \text{per year}.
\]

This matches **option C: 5.5% per year**. The slight discrepancy between the two methods is due to rounding, but the closest answer is **5.5% per year**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C: 5.5% per year**
