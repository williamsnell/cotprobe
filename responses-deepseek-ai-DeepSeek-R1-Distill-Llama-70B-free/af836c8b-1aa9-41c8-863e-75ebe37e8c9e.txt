Question:

A landlord is the owner in fee simple of a tract of land on which is situated a large office building. The landlord leases the land and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years, commencing on August 1, 2001, and terminating at midnight on July 31, 2008. The lease contains the following provisions:"(1) The tenant covenants to pay the rent of $750 per month on the first day of each month. "After three years of the lease had expired, the tenant assigned the entire balance of the lease period to an attorney, who took immediate possession of the leased property. Then in 2005, the attorney assigned his leasehold interest to a doctor. The doctor went into possession, but failed to pay any rent for two months. After the doctor failed to make his rental payments for the first two months of his lease, the landlord brought suit against the tenant to recover for the unpaid rent. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the tenant, because he was not directly responsible for the doctor's failure to pay rent.
B: the landlord, because the tenant and the assignees breached the lease agreement.
C: the tenant, because the landlord did not take action when the doctor failed to pay rent.
D: the tenant, because the doctor, as assignee, would only be held liable.
E: the tenant, because the landlord did not formally approve the assignments.
F: the landlord, because he did not object to the assignments.
G: the landlord, because the doctor, as the final assignee, failed to fulfill his obligation to pay rent.
H: the tenant, because his assignment to the attorney constituted a novation, thereby extinguishing his obligation to pay rent.
I: the landlord, because the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments.
J: the landlord, because the attorney failed to pay rent for two months.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about landlord-tenant law, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A landlord owns a tract of land with an office building. He leases it to a tenant for seven years, from August 1, 2001, to July 31, 2008. The lease says the tenant has to pay $750 monthly on the first of each month.

Then, after three years, the tenant assigns the remaining lease period to an attorney, who takes possession. Later, in 2005, the attorney assigns his leasehold interest to a doctor. The doctor moves in but doesn't pay rent for two months. The landlord sues the original tenant for the unpaid rent.

So the question is, who should win? The options are from A to J, each giving different reasons.

I remember that when a tenant assigns a lease, the assignee takes on the responsibilities, but the original tenant might still be liable unless there's a novation. A novation would require the landlord's agreement to release the original tenant, replacing their obligation with the new tenant's. But in this case, the lease was assigned twice: first to the attorney, then to the doctor. 

The key point is whether the original tenant is still liable for the rent if the assignees don't pay. From what I recall, when a tenant assigns a lease, they remain liable unless the landlord agrees to release them. So if the assignee (or subsequent assignee) fails to pay, the landlord can go after the original tenant.

Looking at the options:

Option I says the landlord should win because the tenant's contractual obligation survived the assignments. That sounds right because without a novation, the tenant is still on the hook.

Option H suggests a novation, but I don't think there was any indication the landlord agreed to that. The question doesn't mention the landlord's approval of the assignments, but even if the landlord didn't object, that doesn't necessarily mean they agreed to a novation. So H is probably incorrect.

Option A says the tenant isn't responsible because it's the doctor's fault. But the tenant's obligation continues unless released, so A is wrong.

Option E suggests the tenant isn't liable because the landlord didn't approve the assignments. But I think the landlord's approval isn't required for the assignment to be effective in terms of transferring liability; it's more about whether the tenant is released, which would require a novation.

Options B and G: B says the landlord wins because both tenant and assignees breached. I'm not sure if the landlord can sue all of them, but the question is about suing the tenant. G says the landlord wins because the doctor failed, but the reason is more about the tenant's ongoing liability.

Option D says the doctor is liable, but the question is whether the landlord can go after the tenant, so D doesn't directly answer.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be I: the landlord because the tenant's obligation survived the assignments.
</think>

The correct answer is based on the principle that when a tenant assigns a lease, the original tenant remains liable for the obligations under the lease unless a novation occurs, which requires the landlord's agreement. Here, the tenant assigned the lease to an attorney, and the attorney later assigned it to a doctor. The doctor's failure to pay rent doesn't release the original tenant from liability because there was no novation. The landlord can therefore sue the tenant for the unpaid rent. 

The best answer is I.

Answer: I
