Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quadratics and their intersections. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that a parabola y1 = x² + 2x +7 and a line y2 =6x + b intersect at only one point. I remember that when a parabola and a line intersect at only one point, that means the line is tangent to the parabola. Oh right, tangency implies that the system of equations has exactly one solution. So, I think I need to set these two equations equal and solve for x, but since there's only one solution, the discriminant must be zero.

Let me write down the equations:

y1 = x² + 2x +7  
y2 =6x + b

Since they intersect where y1 = y2, I set them equal:

x² + 2x +7 =6x + b

Hmm, I should rearrange this to form a quadratic equation. Subtract 6x and b from both sides:

x² + 2x +7 -6x -b =0 → x² -4x + (7 - b) =0

So the quadratic equation is x² -4x + (7 - b) =0.

Now, for a quadratic equation ax² +bx +c=0, the discriminant is D = b² -4ac. And if D=0, there's exactly one real root, which is what we want here.

In this case, a=1, b=-4, c=(7 - b). Wait, wait—no, wait, the quadratic is x² -4x + (7 - b). So the coefficients are:
a =1
b_coeff = -4 (wait, no. Wait, in the standard form, it's ax² +bx +c. So actually, the coefficient of x is -4, so b_coeff is -4, and c is (7 - b).

So the discriminant D would be:
D = (-4)^2 -4*(1)*(7 - b) = 16 -4*(7 - b)

Set D to zero for tangency:

16 -4*(7 - b) =0

Let me compute that:

16 -28 +4b =0 → (-12) +4b=0 →4b=12 →b=3

Wait, that gives b=3. Let me check the options. Option C is 3, so that's probably the answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through the steps again.

Set y1 = y2: x² +2x +7 =6x +b → x² -4x +7 -b =0.

Compute discriminant: (-4)^2 =16, 4ac =4*1*(7 -b)=28 -4b.

So D=16 - (28 -4b) =16 -28 +4b = -12 +4b.

Set D=0: -12 +4b=0 →4b=12 →b=3. Yep, same result.

So the correct answer should be option C, which is 3.

To determine the value of \( b \) such that the parabola \( y_1 = x^2 + 2x + 7 \) and the line \( y_2 = 6x + b \) intersect at only one point, we set the equations equal to each other:

\[
x^2 + 2x + 7 = 6x + b
\]

Rearranging into standard quadratic form:

\[
x^2 - 4x + (7 - b) = 0
\]

For the parabola and the line to intersect at exactly one point, the quadratic equation must have exactly one real solution. This occurs when the discriminant \( D \) is zero. The discriminant of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is given by:

\[
D = b^2 - 4ac
\]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = 7 - b \). Substituting these values into the discriminant:

\[
D = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(7 - b) = 16 - 4(7 - b)
\]

Simplify:

\[
D = 16 - 28 + 4b = -12 + 4b
\]

Set \( D = 0 \) for tangency:

\[
-12 + 4b = 0 \implies 4b = 12 \implies b = 3
\]

Thus, the value of \( b \) is \( 3 \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
