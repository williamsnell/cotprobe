Okay, so I've got this problem here about mixing ammonia solutions. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is asking how much water needs to be added to 5 gallons of a 90% ammonia solution to make it a 60% solution. 

Alright, let's break this down. I remember that when dealing with solutions, the amount of pure substance stays the same when you dilute it by adding more solvent, which in this case is water. So the initial solution is 90% ammonia, which means in those 5 gallons, 90% is ammonia and 10% is water. Wait, no, actually, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, no, the 90% is ammonia, so that's the active ingredient, the rest is probably water. So the 5 gallons is 90% ammonia, so the amount of ammonia is 0.9 * 5 gallons. 

Let me calculate that. 0.9 times 5 is 4.5 gallons. So there's 4.5 gallons of ammonia in the original solution. The rest, which is 0.5 gallons, is water. But wait, wait, the problem says we're adding more water to this. So when we add water, the total volume of the solution will increase, and the concentration of ammonia will decrease to 60%. 

So after adding some amount of water, let's call it x gallons, the total volume becomes 5 + x gallons. And the concentration of ammonia is now 60%, which is 0.6 times the total volume. But the amount of ammonia remains the same, 4.5 gallons. So I can set up an equation here. 

The amount of ammonia after adding water is 0.6 * (5 + x) = 4.5. Let me write that out:

0.6 * (5 + x) = 4.5

Now, I need to solve for x. Let me expand the left side. 

0.6 * 5 is 3, and 0.6 * x is 0.6x. So:

3 + 0.6x = 4.5

Subtract 3 from both sides:

0.6x = 1.5

Now, divide both sides by 0.6 to solve for x:

x = 1.5 / 0.6

Let me calculate that. 1.5 divided by 0.6 is the same as 15 divided by 6, right? Because 1.5 is 15/10, and 0.6 is 6/10. So 15/10 divided by 6/10 is (15/10) * (10/6) = 15/6 = 2.5. 

Wait, no, wait another second. Wait, 1.5 divided by 0.6. Let me compute this accurately. 0.6 times 2 is 1.2. 0.6 times 2.5 is 1.5. Oh yeah, 0.6 * 2.5 = 1.5. So x is 2.5 gallons. 

Wait, wait, but looking back at the options, option A is 2.5 gallons. So is that correct? Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

So initial ammonia is 4.5 gallons. After adding x gallons of water, the total volume is 5 + x. 60% of that is ammonia. So 0.6*(5 + x) = 4.5. Solving gives x = 2.5. So the answer should be option A. 

Wait, but wait another thought. Wait, the initial solution is 5 gallons, 90% ammonia, which is 4.5 gallons NH3, correct. Adding x gallons of water (which is 0% ammonia) so the new amount of NH3 is still 4.5. The new total volume is 5 + x. So 4.5 / (5 + x) = 0.6. So 4.5 = 0.6*(5 + x). So solving for (5 + x) = 4.5 / 0.6 = 7.5 gallons. So 5 + x =7.5, so x=2.5. Yep, that's correct. So the correct answer is A, 2.5 gallons.

To determine how much water must be added to 5 gallons of a 90% ammonia solution to reduce it to a 60% solution, we start by calculating the amount of pure ammonia in the initial solution. Since the solution is 90% ammonia, the amount of ammonia is:

\[
0.9 \times 5 = 4.5 \text{ gallons.}
\]

When water is added, the total volume of the solution increases, but the amount of ammonia remains constant at 4.5 gallons. Let \( x \) represent the amount of water to be added. The new total volume of the solution becomes \( 5 + x \), and the new concentration of ammonia is 60%. This gives the equation:

\[
0.6 \times (5 + x) = 4.5.
\]

Expanding and solving for \( x \):

\[
0.6 \times 5 + 0.6x = 4.5,
\]
\[
3 + 0.6x = 4.5,
\]
\[
0.6x = 1.5,
\]
\[
x = \frac{1.5}{0.6} = 2.5.
\]

Thus, 2.5 gallons of water must be added to reduce the solution to a 60% ammonia concentration. The correct answer is:

**A: 2.5 gallons.**
