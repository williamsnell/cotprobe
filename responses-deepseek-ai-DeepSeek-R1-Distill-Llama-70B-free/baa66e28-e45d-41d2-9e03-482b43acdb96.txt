Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about hostile aggression, and I need to figure out which option best illustrates it. Let me start by recalling what hostile aggression is. From what I remember, hostile aggression is when someone acts aggressively with the intention to cause harm, usually because they're angry or want revenge. It's more about emotion-driven behavior rather than just trying to achieve a goal.

Looking at the options:

Option A: An employee sabotages a coworker's project due to jealousy. That sounds like someone intentionally causing harm because of a negative emotion, jealousy. So that's a possible candidate.

Option B: A waitress breaking cups because she drops a tray. Hmm, that seems more like an accident. She didn't intend to break them; it was a mistake. So probably not hostile aggression.

Option C: A teacher harshly grading because of a personal grudge. That fits because the teacher is intentionally being harsh to harm the student's grade, driven by personal anger or dislike. So that's another option to consider.

Option D: A man slapping his wife because she made hamburgers again. That's a clear case of someone acting out of anger, intending to cause harm. So that's definitely hostile.

Option E: A sanitation man knocking over bushes while throwing a can. That seems accidental. He didn't mean to cause harm; it was just carelessness.

Option F: A careless driver hitting a pedestrian. Wait, is that hostile? Or is it more about recklessness without intent? Careless driving might be more about negligence rather than intentional harm, so maybe not hostile aggression.

So now I'm thinking about which options are the best examples. Hostile aggression is about intent to harm driven by anger. So options A, C, and D all fit that. But the question asks for the best illustration.

Option A is about sabotage due to jealousy, which is hostile. Option C is a grudge leading to harsh grading. Option D is physical violence in response to something minor, which is definitely hostile.

Wait, but the question is about which best illustrates hostile aggression. So perhaps D is the most direct example because it's physical aggression intended to cause harm, driven by anger. Harsh grading (C) is more of a passive-aggressive or indirect form, while D is overt.

Alternatively, the slap is a clear act of aggression aimed at causing harm, so D might be the best answer.

Wait, but let me think again. The question might be testing the understanding between hostile and instrumental aggression. Hostile is emotional, often impulsive, and meant to harm. Instrumental is more calculated to achieve a goal.

In option A, the sabotage is intentional but maybe more of a calculated act. Option D is more impulsive, driven by immediate anger. So perhaps D is the best example of hostile aggression.

Alternatively, option C is also hostile because it's driven by a grudge, which is an emotional state. So I'm a bit torn between C and D.

Wait, the question is about which best illustrates hostile aggression. So I think D is a direct physical act of aggression in the heat of anger, making it a clear example. So the answer is D.

The best illustration of hostile aggression is when someone intentionally causes harm driven by anger or a desire to retaliate. Among the options, D stands out as a clear example of overt, emotion-driven aggression, where a man slaps his wife out of anger. This act is direct, impulsive, and intended to cause harm, fitting the definition of hostile aggression.

Answer: D
