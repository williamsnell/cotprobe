Okay, so I have this question about Carruthers and which moral theory he uses when looking at the moral standing of nonhuman animals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Carruthers is a philosopher who writes about animal rights and ethics. I think he's associated with a particular theory. Let me try to recall.

I know that there are several moral theories: consequentialism, deontology, utilitarianism, Kantianism, etc. So the options are from A to J, but the relevant ones here are probably around those.

Carruthers, if I'm not mistaken, argues that animals don't have the same moral standing as humans. I remember reading that he uses a contractualist approach. Contractualism is about the idea that moral principles are those that would be agreed upon by rational beings in a social contract. So, Carruthers might argue that since animals can't participate in a social contract or agree to moral principles, they don't have the same rights or moral standing.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Another approach is Kantianism, which emphasizes duties and treating others as ends in themselves. But I think Kantians might have a different view on animals, perhaps considering them as having intrinsic value because of their being ends in themselves. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, utilitarianism focuses on consequences and the greatest happiness for the greatest number. So a utilitarian would consider the suffering of animals, but maybe Carruthers isn't a utilitarian because I think he might be more about the moral status based on some criteria like rationality.

Contractualism, which is associated with philosophers like John Rawls, posits that moral principles are justified because they would be agreed upon by free and rational beings. So if Carruthers uses this theory, he might say that since animals aren't rational contractors, they don't have the same moral standing. That makes sense.

So looking back at the options, H is contractualism. So the answer should be H.

Carruthers approaches questions about the moral standing of nonhuman animals from the perspective of contractualism. This theory posits that moral principles are those that would be agreed upon by rational beings in a social contract. Carruthers likely argues that since animals cannot participate in such a contract, they lack the same moral standing as humans. 

Answer: H
