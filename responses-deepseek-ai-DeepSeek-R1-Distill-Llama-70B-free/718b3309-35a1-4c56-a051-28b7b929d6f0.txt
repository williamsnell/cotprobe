Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about similar polygons. Hmm, let's see. The question says that polygon ACDF is similar to polygon VWYZ. Similar polygons, right? That means their corresponding angles are equal and their sides are proportional.

The problem gives me some side lengths: AF is 12, CD is 9, YZ is 10, YW is 6, and ZV is 3y-1. I need to find the length of FD. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused about which sides correspond in the similar polygons. I guess I should figure out the order of the vertices to understand which sides correspond.

Polygon ACDF has vertices in the order A, C, D, F. Polygon VWYZ has V, W, Y, Z. Since they're similar, the order of the letters should correspond. So A corresponds to V, C to W, D to Y, and F to Z. So that means each side in ACDF corresponds to a side in VWYZ in that order.

Wait, maybe I should list the corresponding sides. So AF corresponds to VZ, CD corresponds to WY, DF corresponds to YZ, and maybe FA corresponds to ZV? Or wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the sides between the points. AC corresponds to VW, CD to WY, DF to YZ, and FA to ZV? Not sure, maybe I should draw a rough sketch.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of the sides in order. So side AC corresponds to VW, CD to WY, DF to YZ, and FA to ZV. Or perhaps the order is different. Wait, the naming of the polygon is ACDF, so the sides are AC, CD, DF, and FA. Similarly, VWYZ has sides VW, WY, YZ, and ZV.

So the corresponding sides should be AC to VW, CD to WY, DF to YZ, FA to ZV. So for each side in ACDF, there's a corresponding side in VWYZ.

Now, when polygons are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is constant. So the ratio between AC and VW should be the same as CD and WY, which should be the same as DF and YZ, and so on.

Wait, but I don't have the lengths for all the sides. Let me see what I have. AF is 12, CD is 9, YZ is 10, YW is 6, and ZV is 3y-1. I'm supposed to find FD.

Let me list the knowns and unknowns.

In ACDF:
- AF = 12
- CD = 9
- FD is what I'm looking for.

In VWYZ:
- YZ = 10
- YW = 6
- ZV = 3y-1

Wait, but I'm not sure which sides correspond. Maybe I should set up the ratios properly.

Let me assign the correspondence. Since ACDF ~ VWYZ, the sides correspond as AC/VW = CD/WY = DF/YZ = FA/ZV.

But I don't have all the sides. Let me see.

Wait, the sides given are AF =12, CD=9. In VWYZ, YW=6, YZ=10, and ZV=3y-1.

Wait, AF corresponds to which side in VWYZ? Let me think: in ACDF, the sides are AC, CD, DF, FA. VWYZ's sides are VW, WY, YZ, ZV. So AC corresponds to VW, CD to WY, DF to YZ, and FA to ZV.

So AF is FA, right? So FA corresponds to ZV. Similarly, CD corresponds to WY.

So FA is 12, so ZV is 3y-1, so FA/ZV = 12/(3y-1). And CD is 9, WY is 6, so CD/WY = 9/6 = 3/2.

Since all the ratios should be equal, I can set 12/(3y-1) = 3/2. Let me solve for y.

Cross-multiplying: 12 * 2 = 3*(3y-1)
24 = 9y -3
24 +3 =9y
27=9y
y=3.

Now that I have y=3, I can find ZV. ZV is 3y-1 = 3*3-1=9-1=8.

So ZV is 8. Now, FD is the side in ACDF that corresponds to YZ in VWYZ, which is given as 10.

So the ratio is FD/YZ = 3/2. Because from CD/WY = 9/6 = 3/2, so the scale factor is 3/2.

Wait, so if FD corresponds to YZ, then FD = YZ * (scale factor). Because in ACDF, the sides are larger if the scale factor is 3/2. Wait, wait. Let me think: if ACDF is larger than VWYZ, then the ratio of ACDF's sides to VWYZ's sides is 3/2.

Wait, when CD is 9 and WY is 6, 9/6=3/2, so the ratio is 3/2. So each side in ACDF is 3/2 times the corresponding side in VWYZ.

So FD corresponds to YZ. YZ is 10, so FD = (3/2)*10 = 15.

Wait, but let me check that again. If the polygons are similar, and ACDF is similar to VWYZ, then the ratio is AC/VW = CD/WY = FD/YZ = FA/ZV.

So if CD/WY is 9/6=3/2, then FD/YZ must also be 3/2. So FD = (3/2)*YZ.

YZ is 10, so FD = (3/2)*10 = 15. So the length of FD is 15.

Wait, but looking at the options, J is 15. So the answer should be J.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that polygon ACDF is similar to polygon VWYZ. This means their corresponding sides are proportional. The vertices correspond in the order A → V, C → W, D → Y, and F → Z. Therefore, the sides AC, CD, DF, and FA in ACDF correspond to VW, WY, YZ, and ZV in VWYZ, respectively.

Given:
- \( AF = 12 \)
- \( CD = 9 \)
- \( YZ = 10 \)
- \( YW = 6 \)
- \( ZV = 3y - 1 \)

We need to find the length of \( FD \).

### Step 1: Determine the scale factor
The ratio of corresponding sides in similar polygons is constant. Using \( CD \) and \( WY \):
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{CD}{WY} = \frac{9}{6} = \frac{3}{2}
\]
Thus, the scale factor is \( \frac{3}{2} \).

### Step 2: Solve for \( y \)
Since \( AF \) corresponds to \( ZV \), we set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{AF}{ZV} = \frac{3}{2}
\]
Substituting \( AF = 12 \) and \( ZV = 3y - 1 \):
\[
\frac{12}{3y - 1} = \frac{3}{2}
\]
Cross-multiplying:
\[
12 \cdot 2 = 3 \cdot (3y - 1)
\]
\[
24 = 9y - 3
\]
\[
27 = 9y
\]
\[
y = 3
\]
Now, substitute \( y = 3 \) into \( ZV = 3y - 1 \):
\[
ZV = 3(3) - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8
\]

### Step 3: Find \( FD \)
Since \( FD \) corresponds to \( YZ \), and the scale factor is \( \frac{3}{2} \), we calculate:
\[
FD = YZ \cdot \frac{3}{2}
\]
Substituting \( YZ = 10 \):
\[
FD = 10 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 15
\]

Thus, the length of \( FD \) is 15.
