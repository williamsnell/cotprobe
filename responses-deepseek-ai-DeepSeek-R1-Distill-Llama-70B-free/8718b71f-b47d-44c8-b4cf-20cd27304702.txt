Question:

A woman owned a 10-acre tract of rural farmland in fee simple absolute. The woman agreed to sell the farmland to a man, and each signed a writing stating that the farmland was beitig sold: ". . . for $10,000, receipt of which is acknowledged. " In actuality, the man had not yet paid the woman the $10,000. At the date set for closing, the woman transferred a deed to the farmland to the man, who gave the woman a check for $10,000. Howevei, a few days after the woman deposited the check, she received notice from her bank that the check had not cleared, due to insufficient funds in the account. The woman then brought suit against the man. At trial, the woman seeks to testify that the man did not in fact pay her the $10,000 as recited in their written instrument. The man objects to the woman's proposed testimony. Will the trial court judge be correct in sustaining the man's objection?

Options:

A: Yes, because the woman accepted the check as payment and the risk of the check not clearing falls on her.
B: No, because the woman can demonstrate that the man has breached the contract.
C: No, because the man's act of issuing a check that did not clear is evidence of fraudulent intent.
D: Yes, because the written instrument appears to be a complete integration of the parties' agreement.
E: No, because the parol evidence rule does not operate to exclude evidence to show lack or want of consideration.
F: Yes, because the parol evidence rule prohibits the introduction of oral agreements that contradict written agreements.
G: Yes, because the woman's acknowledgment of receipt in the written instrument is conclusive proof of payment.
H: No, because the parol evidence rule does not apply to events occurring after the forming of the writing.
I: Yes, because the doctrine of promissory estoppel will prevent the woman from denying her own signed acknowledgment that she received the $10,000.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this legal question, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me read the scenario again to make sure I understand the facts.

So, there's a woman who owns a 10-acre farmland, and she agreed to sell it to a man. They both signed a written agreement that says the farmland is being sold for $10,000, and there's a part that says "receipt of which is acknowledged." But the catch is, the man hadn't actually paid the $10,000 yet when they signed that agreement. 

Then, on the closing date, the woman transferred the deed to the man, and he gave her a check for $10,000. She deposited the check, but a few days later, her bank told her the check didn't clear because there weren't enough funds in his account. Now, she's suing him, and at trial, she wants to testify that he didn't really pay her the $10,000 as their written agreement stated. The man objects to her testimony, and the question is whether the judge will sustain that objection.

The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, so what's the legal issue here? It seems to involve contract law, specifically the parol evidence rule. I remember that the parol evidence rule generally prohibits the introduction of evidence of prior or contemporaneous negotiations and agreements that contradict the terms of a written contract. But there are exceptions, like if there's a claim of fraud or if the agreement is not fully integrated.

Wait, but in this case, the written agreement says "receipt of which is acknowledged." So, the woman is trying to testify that she didn't actually receive the money, which would contradict the written statement. The man is objecting, so the court has to decide if her testimony is admissible.

So, the key here is whether the parol evidence rule applies. The written instrument seems to be a complete integration because it includes the terms of the sale, including the payment. If it's a fully integrated agreement, then prior or contemporaneous oral agreements can't contradict it. But does the parol evidence rule prevent a party from introducing evidence that the written statement about payment was false?

Wait, but the written agreement says that the $10,000 was received. So, the woman's testimony would be that she did not receive the payment, which would directly contradict the written agreement.

But wait, when they signed the agreement, had the payment been made? The problem states that when they signed the writing, the man hadn't paid yet. So the written agreement might have been made in advance of the actual payment, which was supposed to happen at closing.

At the closing, the deed was transferred, and the man gave a check. But the check bounced. So the woman is trying to say that she didn't receive the payment as per the agreement.

Hmm, so the written agreement includes an acknowledgment of receipt of payment. But if that's not true, can she testify to that? Or does the parol evidence rule prevent her from doing so?

I think the parol evidence rule doesn't apply here because she's not trying to vary the terms of the written agreement but rather to show that the condition in the agreement wasn't met. Alternatively, she's trying to show that the consideration (the $10,000) wasn't actually received, which could mean there's a failure of consideration.

Wait, but the written agreement says she acknowledged receipt. If she's trying to testify that she didn't receive it, that would be contradicting the written agreement. So, under the parol evidence rule, if the agreement is fully integrated, she can't introduce evidence to contradict it.

Another angle: The written agreement might be considered a receipt as well as a sale agreement. If she acknowledged receipt, then maybe she's bound by that, unless she can show that the acknowledgment was false, perhaps due to mistake or fraud.

Wait, but the man didn't pay at the time of signing the agreement. So when she signed, she acknowledged receipt, but in reality, she hadn't received it yet. So that makes the acknowledgment false. So perhaps she can testify to that.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the options.

Option A: Yes, because she accepted the check and the risk is on her. That's about the check being payment, but if the check didn't clear, maybe she accepted it as payment but it didn't work out. But the issue is about testifying that she didn't receive payment as per the written agreement.

Option B: No, because she can show breach of contract. Maybe, but the objection is about the admissibility of her testimony, not whether she can prove breach.

Option C: No, because the man's act shows fraud. That's a possibility, but maybe that's an exception to the parol evidence rule. If she's alleging fraud, she might be allowed to introduce evidence.

Option D: Yes, because the written instrument is a complete integration. So parol evidence can't contradict it.

Option E: No, because parol evidence doesn't exclude evidence about lack of consideration. Wait, but the written agreement says consideration was received. So if she's trying to say no consideration, would that be allowed? Alternatively, maybe the consideration was the promise to pay, not the actual payment.

Option F: Yes, because parol evidence prohibits oral agreements that contradict written ones. But she's not introducing an oral agreement; she's testifying to a fact (non-payment) that contradicts the written statement.

Option G: Yes, because the acknowledgment is conclusive. That seems strong, but is it really conclusive? If she can show that the acknowledgment was false, maybe she can testify.

Option H: No, because parol evidence applies to events after the writing. Wait, the events here (the check being given) happened after the signing of the written agreement. So if the parol evidence rule applies to prior or contemporaneous agreements, maybe events after aren't covered. So she can testify about subsequent events.

Option I: Yes, because promissory estoppel. I'm not sure how that applies here. She's the one who acknowledged receipt, maybe she's estopped from denying it, but I'm not certain.

So, thinking through, the written agreement includes an acknowledgment of receipt. So, if the woman wants to testify that she didn't receive the payment, she's contradicting the written agreement. The parol evidence rule would prevent her from doing that if the agreement is fully integrated. But wait, the agreement was about the sale, and the acknowledgment of receipt might be part of it. But the actual payment didn't happen yet. So maybe the written agreement isn't fully integrated because the payment was supposed to happen at a later time (closing), so the acknowledgment was premature.

Alternatively, the written agreement's language could be seen as a receipt, which she's now trying to contradict. But receipts are generally considered to be true unless there's fraud. But if she acknowledged receipt when she didn't receive it, that's a false statement. So perhaps she can testify to that.

Wait, but parol evidence rule applies to the terms of the agreement, not to whether the agreement's statements are true. If the written agreement includes a false statement, she might be able to testify about it, especially if it's about consideration.

Another thought: The written agreement says "receipt of which is acknowledged." So, the woman is testifying that she didn't receive the money, which would mean that the consideration wasn't paid. If the consideration wasn't paid, the contract might not be enforceable, or she might be able to rescind it.

But the parol evidence rule is about prior agreements, not about whether the consideration was actually paid. So perhaps she can testify about that because it's not about varying the terms of the contract but about whether the condition (payment) was fulfilled.

Wait, but the written agreement states that the consideration was received. So, she's trying to say that wasn't the case. That's a contradiction, so the parol evidence rule would block her testimony if the agreement is fully integrated.

Alternatively, the parol evidence rule doesn't apply because she's not trying to introduce a prior agreement but rather to show that a fact stated in the agreement was false. So maybe she can testify.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let's look back at the options.

Option E says no because parol evidence doesn't exclude evidence about lack of consideration. That's an exception. So if the issue is whether consideration was provided, parol evidence can be used. Because the written agreement says consideration was received, but she's saying it wasn't, that's about the existence of consideration, not about the terms of the agreement.

So, the parol evidence rule doesn't bar evidence about whether consideration was actually provided. Therefore, the woman can testify that she didn't receive the $10,000, which would show lack of consideration, making the contract unenforceable or allowing her to rescind it.

So, looking at the options, option E says no, because parol evidence doesn't exclude evidence to show lack of consideration. That seems correct.

Wait, but option H says no because parol evidence applies to events after the writing. The check was given at closing, which is after the written agreement was signed. So, perhaps events after the agreement are not covered by the parol evidence rule, so she can testify about that.

Alternatively, the written agreement's acknowledgment was at the time of signing, but the payment was supposed to happen later. So the acknowledgment was premature, and when it came time to pay, the check bounced.

Hmm, perhaps the woman's testimony is about events after the agreement, so the parol evidence rule (which applies to prior or contemporaneous agreements) doesn't apply. Therefore, she can testify, making option H correct.

Wait, but the written agreement includes the acknowledgment of receipt. So when she testifies that she didn't receive the payment, she's contradicting the written agreement. But if the payment was supposed to happen later, maybe the acknowledgment was part of the agreement that payment would be made, not that it had been made.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The written agreement says the farmland was sold for $10,000, and "receipt of which is acknowledged." So, at the time of signing the agreement, the woman acknowledged receiving the $10,000, but in reality, the man hadn't paid yet. So she's trying to testify that she didn't receive it, which contradicts the written agreement.

Under the parol evidence rule, if the agreement is fully integrated, she can't introduce evidence to contradict it. But if the agreement isn't fully integrated, she might be able to. However, the question states that they both signed a writing stating the sale, so it's likely an integrated agreement.

But wait, the acknowledgment of receipt is part of the agreement. So, if she's testifying that she didn't receive the money, that's contradicting the written agreement, which the parol evidence rule would prevent. So the judge would sustain the objection, making the answer yes.

Wait, but some exceptions to the parol evidence rule include fraud, mistake, or lack of consideration. So if she's trying to show that the acknowledgment was false, perhaps due to mistake or fraud, she might be allowed to testify.

Alternatively, the consideration was the promise to pay, not the actual payment. So, if the man didn't pay, that's a breach, but the acknowledgment in the agreement might be an accord, which would require mutual agreement to substitute the promise for the performance.

I'm getting stuck again. Let's look at the options.

Option G says yes because the acknowledgment is conclusive. If the woman acknowledged receipt, maybe she's bound by that. But if she can show that the acknowledgment was false, perhaps she can avoid that.

Option D says yes because the written instrument is a complete integration. That would mean parol evidence can't contradict it, so her testimony is inadmissible.

But earlier, I thought that evidence about lack of consideration is an exception. So option E would allow her testimony because it's about lack of consideration.

Wait, but the written agreement says that the consideration was received. So, she's trying to say that the consideration wasn't received, which is about the existence of consideration. Therefore, under the exception, she can testify.

So, the correct answer would be option E: No, because parol evidence doesn't exclude evidence to show lack of consideration.

Alternatively, the acknowledgment in the written agreement might be considered a receipt, and she can't contradict it unless she can show it was obtained by fraud or mistake.

In this case, the woman didn't receive payment when she signed the agreement, so the acknowledgment was false. But she signed it, so maybe she's estopped from denying it, unless she can show she was tricked into signing.

But the facts don't mention fraud or mistake, so perhaps she can't claim that. Therefore, the acknowledgment stands, and she can't testify against it.

So, the judge would sustain the objection, making options like D, F, or G correct.

Wait, but the man gave a check at closing, which bounced. So the woman is testifying that she didn't receive the $10,000. The written agreement's acknowledgment was before the check was given. So perhaps the acknowledgment was premature, but she still acknowledged it. Therefore, she can't later contradict it, unless she can show that the acknowledgment was false.

But without evidence of fraud, I think she's bound by the written agreement. So the judge would sustain the man's objection, meaning the answer is yes.

Looking back at the options, option D says yes because the written instrument is a complete integration. So parol evidence can't contradict it.

Alternatively, option G says yes because the acknowledgment is conclusive.

I think the correct answer here is that the trial court will sustain the objection because the written agreement is fully integrated, so the woman can't contradict it with parol evidence. Therefore, option D or G.

But option G says the acknowledgment is conclusive proof, which I'm not sure is the case. It might not be conclusive if she can show it was false, but without evidence of fraud, she can't.

Alternatively, option D is about complete integration, which would apply here.

So, I think the correct answer is D: Yes, because the written instrument appears to be a complete integration of the parties' agreement.
</think>

The legal issue in this case revolves around the parol evidence rule and whether the woman can testify that she did not receive the $10,000 as stated in the written agreement. The written agreement includes an acknowledgment of receipt of payment, which the woman now seeks to contradict with her testimony. The man objects, arguing that the parol evidence rule prohibits such testimony.

The parol evidence rule generally bars the introduction of evidence that contradicts the terms of a fully integrated written agreement. Here, the written agreement appears to be a complete integration of the parties' agreement, as it includes the terms of the sale and the acknowledgment of receipt of payment. If the agreement is fully integrated, the woman cannot introduce evidence to contradict the written terms, including the acknowledgment of receipt.

While exceptions to the parol evidence rule exist (e.g., fraud, mistake, or lack of consideration), the facts do not indicate that the acknowledgment of receipt was obtained through fraud or mistake. Therefore, the woman is bound by the written agreement's terms. Her testimony would directly contradict the acknowledgment of receipt, which is part of the fully integrated agreement. As a result, the trial court would likely sustain the man's objection under the parol evidence rule.

Option D correctly reflects this reasoning: the written instrument appears to be a complete integration of the parties' agreement, and the parol evidence rule prohibits the introduction of evidence that contradicts its terms.
