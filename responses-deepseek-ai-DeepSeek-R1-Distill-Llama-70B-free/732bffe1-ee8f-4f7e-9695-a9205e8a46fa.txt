Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Wilson cloud chamber. Hmm, I remember that cloud chambers work by having particles ionize the gas inside, and then the ions act as nucleation points for condensation, creating visible tracks. The process involves cooling the gas to make it condense.

The question says that the expansion is approximately reversible and adiabatic. Oh right, adiabatic means no heat exchange with the surroundings. So the process is quick and relies on the work done by the system (the gas expanding) leading to a drop in temperature.

The volume ratio given is final over initial, which is 1.375 to 1. Wait, so V_final = 1.375 * V_initial. So the volume increases by 37.5%. Since it's an adiabatic expansion, the temperature should drop because the gas is doing work on the surroundings, losing internal energy.

I think the formula for an adiabatic process is TV^(gamma-1) = constant, where gamma is the ratio of specific heats (Cp/Cv). Oh wait, the problem gives gamma as 1.41. So gamma is 1.41 here.

Wait, but wait. For an adiabatic expansion, the relation is T_initial * V_initial^(gamma-1) = T_final * V_final^(gamma-1). Because the formula is T V^{γ-1} = constant. So I can write T_final = T_initial * (V_initial / V_final)^(γ-1).

Wait, let me make sure. The formula for adiabatic processes is T1 * (V1)^(γ-1) = T2 * (V2)^(γ-1), so T2 = T1 * (V1/V2)^(γ-1).

Yes, that's correct. So plugging in the numbers: T_initial is 20°C, but wait, I need to convert that to Kelvin because the formula uses absolute temperature. So 20°C is 293.15 K.

Wait, but wait, let me think. Since the change is (gamma-1), and the volumes are in ratio, the temperature change will be based on that.

The volume ratio is V2/V1 = 1.375, so V1/V2 = 1/1.375. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 1.375. Let me see, 1.375 is 11/8, so 1/(11/8) = 8/11 ≈ 0.7273.

Gamma is 1.41, so gamma-1 is 0.41.

So the exponent is (gamma-1) times the natural log of (V1/V2). Wait, no, the formula is T2 = T1 * (V1/V2)^(gamma-1). So we can compute that exponent.

So let's compute (0.7273) raised to 0.41. Hmm, that's a bit tricky without a calculator, but I can approximate it. Let's see, 0.7^0.4 is approximately? Let me think. 0.7^0.5 is about 0.836, but since 0.4 is less than 0.5, it'll be higher. Wait, actually, 0.7^0.4 is approximately 0.7^(2/5). Maybe around 0.7^0.4 ≈ 0.7^(0.4) = e^{0.4 * ln(0.7)}.

Calculating ln(0.7) is about -0.3567. Multiply by 0.4 gives -0.1427. e^(-0.1427) is approximately 0.868.

Wait, but wait, our exponent is 0.41, and the base is 0.7273. So maybe I should be more precise. Let's try a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps using logarithms more accurately. Let me compute ln(0.7273). Let's see, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, ln(0.75) is about -0.2877. 0.7273 is between 0.7 and 0.75. Maybe around -0.318.

So ln(0.7273) ≈ -0.318. Multiply by 0.41 gives -0.1304. e^(-0.1304) is about 0.878. So the factor is approximately 0.878.

So T2 = 293.15 K * 0.878 ≈ 257.3 K.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 293.15 * 0.878. 0.8 * 293 is 234.4, and 0.078 * 293 is about 22.9, so total approx 257.3 K.

Now, converting back to Celsius: 257.3 K is 257.3 - 273.15 = -15.85°C. So approximately -15.8°C.

Looking at the options, option I is -15.8°C. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but wait, another thought. In an adiabatic process for an ideal gas, the formula is T2 = T1 * (V1/V2)^(gamma-1). Yes, that's correct. So I think I did it right.

So the initial temperature is 20°C, which is about 293 K. After expansion, the temperature drops to 257 K, which is about -16°C. So option I is -15.8°C, which matches.

To solve the problem, we analyze the adiabatic expansion of the gas in the Wilson cloud chamber. The process is governed by the relation:

\[
T_1 \cdot V_1^{\gamma - 1} = T_2 \cdot V_2^{\gamma - 1}
\]

where \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) are the initial and final temperatures, \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \) are the initial and final volumes, and \( \gamma \) is the ratio of specific heats. Rearranging for \( T_2 \), we get:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right)^{\gamma - 1}
\]

### Step 1: Convert initial temperature to Kelvin
The initial temperature is \( T_1 = 20^\circ \text{C} \), which is equivalent to:

\[
T_1 = 20 + 273.15 = 293.15 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the volume ratio
The volume ratio is given as:

\[
\frac{V_2}{V_1} = 1.375 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{V_1}{V_2} = \frac{1}{1.375} \approx 0.7273
\]

### Step 3: Compute the exponent
The ratio of specific heats is \( \gamma = 1.41 \), so:

\[
\gamma - 1 = 1.41 - 1 = 0.41
\]

Thus, the temperature drop depends on \( \left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right)^{\gamma - 1} \), which is:

\[
\left(0.7273\right)^{0.41}
\]

Approximating this value:

\[
\ln(0.7273) \approx -0.318 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \ln\left(\left(0.7273\right)^{0.41}\right) = 0.41 \cdot (-0.318) \approx -0.1304
\]

\[
\left(0.7273\right)^{0.41} \approx e^{-0.1304} \approx 0.878
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the final temperature
Using the formula for \( T_2 \):

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right)^{\gamma - 1} = 293.15 \cdot 0.878 \approx 257.3 \, \text{K}
\]

Convert \( T_2 \) back to Celsius:

\[
T_2 = 257.3 - 273.15 \approx -15.85^\circ \text{C}
\]

### Step 5: Match the closest option
The closest option to \( -15.85^\circ \text{C} \) is \( -15.8^\circ \text{C} \), which corresponds to **option I**.
