Okay, so I've got this economics question here about taxes and their effect on NNP. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is about a lump-sum tax reducing disposable income and how that affects the Net National Product (NNP). I remember that taxes can influence consumption and savings, which in turn affect the overall economy.

Wait, the question mentions the Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS). Oh right, MPS is the fraction of additional income that a household saves rather than consumes. So if MPS is 0.25, that means for every extra dollar earned, 25 cents are saved and 75 cents are spent.

The government is levying a lump-sum tax that reduces disposable income by $50 billion. A lump-sum tax is a fixed amount, so it doesn't depend on income level. This kind of tax is supposed to have different effects compared to, say, a proportional income tax because it doesn't affect the incentive to work or invest as much.

I think I need to figure out the impact on aggregate demand or maybe the multiplier effect here. Oh wait, when disposable income decreases, people will consume less, which affects the overall demand in the economy. The change in consumption would then have a multiplier effect on the national income.

So the initial change is a $50 billion reduction in disposable income. But the multiplier effect could make the total change larger. The formula for the multiplier when considering MPS is 1/(MPS), I think. Wait, no, the multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC), where MPC is the Marginal Propensity to Consume. Since MPS + MPC = 1, if MPS is 0.25, then MPC is 0.75. So the multiplier would be 1/(1 - 0.75) = 1/0.25 = 4. 

Wait, but in this case, the tax reduces disposable income, which reduces consumption. So the reduction in consumption would be the initial $50 billion multiplied by the multiplier. But wait, no, actually, the initial effect is a $50 billion decrease in disposable income. How does that translate to consumption?

Let me clarify: The tax reduces disposable income by $50 billion. Since MPC is 0.75, the initial drop in consumption would be 0.75 * 50 billion? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the initial change in disposable income is a $50 billion decrease. So the change in consumption is MPC times that change. So 0.75 * 50 = $37.5 billion decrease in consumption. But that's just the first round effect.

Wait, but the multiplier comes into play because the reduced consumption leads to reduced income for businesses, which then reduces their investment and leads to further reductions in consumption, and so on. So the total effect is the initial change multiplied by the multiplier.

Wait, no. The initial change is the $50 billion reduction in disposable income. But because people save a portion of that, the impact on spending is lessened. So the total effect on the economy would be the change in disposable income multiplied by the multiplier. Or wait, perhaps it's the other way around.

Alternatively, the total decrease in NNP would be the initial tax multiplied by the multiplier. Wait, but the tax itself isn't an expenditure; it's a reduction in disposable income. So the multiplier applies to the change in consumption caused by the tax.

Let me think again. The tax reduces disposable income by $50 billion. The MPC is 0.75, so the first round effect on consumption is a decrease of 0.75 * 50 = $37.5 billion. Then, this $37.5 billion decrease in consumption leads to a decrease in income for businesses, which then reduces their investment and so on. So the total change is the initial $37.5 billion multiplied by the multiplier.

Wait, what's the correct approach here. I remember that the tax multiplier is different from the expenditure multiplier. Oh right, the tax multiplier is smaller because the tax affects disposable income, which then affects consumption. So the formula for the tax multiplier is (MPC)/(1 - MPC), but wait, no. Or perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, the formula for the change in equilibrium income (NNP here) when a lump-sum tax is imposed is: ΔY = (ΔT) * (MPC)/(1 - MPC). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Or is it ΔY = ΔT / (1 - MPC)?

Wait, another approach. The initial reduction in disposable income is $50 billion. The decrease in consumption is (MPC) * $50b. Then, that decrease in consumption leads to a further decrease in income, which leads to further decreases in consumption, etc. So the total change in consumption is (MPC * ΔT) / (1 - MPC). But wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, think about the multiplier effect as follows: the initial change is a reduction in disposable income of $50 billion. The MPC is 0.75, so the change in consumption is 0.75 * 50 = 37.5 billion. Then, that 37.5 billion is the initial impact on the economy, which then causes a multiplier effect. So the total change in NNP would be 37.5 billion divided by (1 - 0.75), which is 37.5 / 0.25 = 150 billion. Wait, that seems high. But let me check the formula.

Wait, the formula for the multiplier when a lump-sum tax is introduced is: change in income = (change in tax) * MPC / (1 - MPC). So, in this case, the change in tax is an increase of $50 billion (since it's a tax), which reduces disposable income. So the change in income would be (50) * (0.75) / (1 - 0.75) = 50 * 0.75 / 0.25 = 50 * 3 = 150 billion. So the NNP would decrease by $150 billion.

Looking back at the options, option I is $150 billion. So the correct answer should be I.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because another approach I remember is that the tax multiplier is the MPC divided by (1 - MPC). So the multiplier is 0.75 / 0.25 = 3. So the total effect is 3 * 50 = 150. Yes, that matches. So the NNP decreases by $150 billion. So the answer is I.

The government imposes a lump-sum tax that reduces disposable income by $50 billion. To determine the effect on NNP, we must account for the multiplier effect. The Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) is 0.25, so the Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) is 1 - MPS = 0.75. The multiplier is calculated as:

\[
\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - \text{MPC}} = \frac{1}{1 - 0.75} = \frac{1}{0.25} = 4
\]

However, the tax multiplier is smaller because the tax reduces disposable income, which then affects consumption. The correct formula for the total change in NNP is:

\[
\Delta Y = \Delta T \times \frac{\text{MPC}}{1 - \text{MPC}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta Y = 50 \times \frac{0.75}{1 - 0.75} = 50 \times \frac{0.75}{0.25} = 50 \times 3 = 150 \, \text{billion}
\]

Thus, the total decrease in NNP is $150 billion. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

I: $150 billion
