Okay, so I've got this problem here about J. Robertson and Co. selling furniture to Haverson Stores. The amount is $13,560. They sent a draft dated July 10 with terms of "90 days after date," and it bears interest at 6%. Then, this draft was discounted on August 30 at a rate of 6 and a half percent, and the bank charged a collection fee of 1/10 of a percent. The question is asking for the proceeds, and there are multiple choices to pick from.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. So, a draft is like a bill of exchange, right? When it's discounted, the bank is essentially giving the seller the money before the due date, but they take a discount. So the proceeds would be the face value minus the discount and any fees.

First, I think I need to figure out the due date of the draft. The draft is dated July 10 and is payable 90 days after that. So adding 90 days to July 10. Let me count that out. July has 31 days, so from July 10, adding 21 days gets me to July 31. That leaves 69 days remaining. August has 31 days, so that uses up 31, leaving 38 days for September. So September 7 would be the 90th day. So the due date is September 7.

Now, the draft is being discounted on August 30. So the time from August 30 to September 7 is 8 days. So the discount period is 8 days. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Because when you discount a bill, you calculate the interest from the date of discounting until the due date.

Wait, no, the discounting is done by the bank, which essentially buys the bill at a discounted value. So the bank will calculate the discount based on the time remaining until the maturity date.

So the steps I think are: calculate the discount, subtract that and the collection fee from the face value to get the proceeds.

The face value is $13,560. The interest rate on the draft is 6%, but the discounting is done at 6.5%. Wait, no, the interest on the draft is 6%, but the bank's discount rate is 6.5%. So the discount would be calculated using the bank's rate. Also, the bank charges a collection fee of 0.1%.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So the draft is at 6% interest, but the discounting rate is 6.5%. So when the bank discounts it, they're using their rate, which is higher than the draft's interest rate, which would mean the discount is a bit more.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest on the draft is the rate that would apply if it weren't discounted. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

When a bill is discounted, the bank calculates the present value. The formula for the discount is usually face value times the discount rate times the time in years. But wait, maybe it's calculated as (face value) * (rate) * (time). But I'm not exactly sure about the formula.

Wait, the discount is calculated as the face value multiplied by the discount rate multiplied by the time period until maturity. Then, the proceeds would be the face value minus the discount, minus any fees.

Alternatively, the present value is face value divided by (1 + (rate * time)). But I think the discount method is more appropriate here.

Wait, let's clarify. The two methods are the straight discount method and the present value (or discount) method. For the straight discount method, the discount is (face value) * (rate) * (time), and the proceeds are face value minus discount.

In the present value method, the proceeds are face value divided by (1 + rate*time), which effectively gives the present value.

But I think for this problem, since it's a bank discount, they usually use the straight discount method. So I'll proceed with that.

So the steps are:

1. Calculate the number of days from August 30 to September 7, which is 8 days.

2. Convert this into years. Since it's 8 days out of 365, that's 8/365 years.

3. Calculate the discount: face value * discount rate * time.

But wait, the discount rate is given as 6.5%, which is an annual rate. So the discount would be 13,560 * (6.5/100) * (8/365).

Wait, but wait, the draft is at 6%, but the discounting rate is 6.5%, so yes, that's correct.

Then, the proceeds would be face value minus discount and minus the bank's collection fee.

Wait, but the collection fee is a small percentage. So the collection fee is (1/10)%, which is 0.1%. So that's 0.1% of the face value, I think. Or is it 0.1% of the proceeds? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says the bank charged a collection fee of (1/10)%, which is 0.1%. So I think that fee is a percentage of the face value. So the total deductions are the discount and the fee.

So first, compute the discount:

Discount = 13,560 * (6.5/100) * (8/365)

Let me compute that.

6.5% is 0.065. 8/365 is approximately 0.0219178.

So 13,560 * 0.065 = 881.4. Then multiply by 8/365: 881.4 * (8/365) ≈ let's see, 881.4 * 8 = 7051.2, divided by 365 ≈ 19.3.

So discount is approximately $19.30.

Then the collection fee is 0.1% of 13,560. So 13,560 * 0.001 = $13.56.

So total deductions are $19.30 + $13.56 = $32.86.

So proceeds would be 13,560 - 32.86 = $13,527.14.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that number. Hmm. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is applied after the discount. Or maybe I got the way the discount is calculated wrong.

Another approach: Maybe the discount is calculated based on the time from the date of the draft, but I don't think so. No, the discounting date is August 30, so the time from August 30 to September 7 is 8 days.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the discount using 360 days instead of 365. Sometimes financial calculations use 360 days for simplicity. Let me try that.

So 8/360 is approximately 0.022222.

So discount would be 13,560 * 0.065 * (8/360).

Compute that: 13,560 * 0.065 = 881.4. 8/360 is 0.022222. So 881.4 * 0.022222 ≈ 19.6.

So discount ≈ $19.60.

Then, the collection fee is 13,560 * 0.001 = $13.56.

Total deductions: 19.60 + 13.56 = $33.16.

Proceeds: 13,560 - 33.16 = $13,526.84.

Still not matching any options. Hmm. Maybe I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, perhaps the interest on the draft is being considered as part of the proceeds. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think again.

The draft is submitted in payment, so it's like a note receivable. When Robertson discounts it to the bank, the bank will compute the present value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the interest that has accrued on the draft up to August 30, and then calculate the discount. Or maybe not, because the draft is a 90-day note, so the interest would only start from the due date.

Wait, no. The draft is a 90-day note, so it's due on September 7. So from July 10 to August 30 is 51 days. Wait, let me check that.

Wait, July 10 to July 31 is 21 days (including the 10th?), no, wait: from July 10 to July 31 is 21 days (since 31-10=21, but if you include both days, it's 22? No, because if you're counting days after July 10, then July 10 is day 0, July 11 is day 1, so up to July 31 is 21 days. Then August has 31 days, so from August 1 to August 30 is 30 days. So total days from July 10 to August 30 is 21 + 30 = 51 days.

Wait, wait, actually, if the draft was dated July 10, then the 90 days after would be day 0 on July 10. So the due date is day 90. But when calculating the days from July 10 to August 30, it's 51 days (July 10 to August 9 is 31 - 10 + 1 = 22 days in July, plus 30 days in August up to August 30? Wait, no, August 30 is included. Wait, maybe I should count it properly.

July has 31 days, so from July 10 to July 31: 31 -10 = 21 days (since July 10 is day 1, July 11 day 2, ..., July 31 day 22). Wait, no, that might not be the right way. Let me think: July 10 is the starting point, so the days after July 10 are counted, so July 10 is day 0, July 11 is day 1, up to August 30.

So total days from July 10 to August 30: July has 31 days, so from July 10 to July 31 is 22 days (including the 10th?), no, wait, July 10 is day 0, then up to July 31 is 21 days (since 31-10=21). Then August 1 to August 30 is 30 days. So total days: 21 +30=51 days.

So the time since the draft was issued is 51 days. But when discounting on August 30, the remaining days until September 7 is 8 days (as before).

Wait, but when discounting, the bank calculates the discount based on the time from the discount date to the due date, which is 8 days.

Wait, but maybe the interest is calculated on the draft from the issue date to the discount date. Because the draft is a usance bill, so it's a term bill, which would accrue interest from the issue date until the due date. So when it's discounted before maturity, the bank would compute the interest that's accrued up to the discount date and deduct that as part of the discount.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently.

The face value of the draft is $13,560, which includes the principal plus interest. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the face value is the amount to be paid at maturity, which includes the principal plus interest. So when the draft is created, the face value is the amount that the buyer (Haverson) has to pay, which is the selling price plus interest.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's clarify:

When a seller (Robertson) sends a draft to the buyer (Haverson), the buyer accepts it, and it becomes a bill of exchange. The face value is the amount the buyer must pay, which is the invoice amount plus interest. Or is it just the invoice amount, with the interest calculated separately?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula for the proceeds when a note is discounted.

When a note is discounted, the proceeds are calculated as the face value minus the discount. The discount is calculated as the face value multiplied by the discount rate multiplied by the time until maturity.

But perhaps the formula is:

Proceeds = Face Value - (Face Value × Discount Rate × Time)

But sometimes, the discount is calculated as:

Discount = Face Value × Rate × Time

So, as before.

Alternatively, the present value method would be:

Proceeds = Face Value / (1 + (Rate × Time))

But I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me try to think of an example. Suppose I have a $100 note due in 1 year at 6% discount. If I discount it at 6%, the discount would be $6, so proceeds $94.

Alternatively, using present value, it's 100/(1+0.06) = approx 94.34.

So the straight discount method gives a slightly lower proceeds because it's calculated differently.

But in this problem, I think the straight discount method is intended, especially since it's a bank discount.

So, going back, the discount is 13,560 * 0.065 * (8/365). Let me calculate that precisely.

First, 8/365 = 0.0219178.

13,560 * 0.065 = 881.4.

Then, 881.4 * 0.0219178 ≈ 19.3.

So discount is approximately $19.30.

Then the collection fee is 13,560 * 0.001 = $13.56.

So total deductions are 19.30 +13.56 = 32.86.

Proceeds = 13,560 -32.86= 13,527.14.

But looking at the options, none of them match that. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the discount is calculated using 360 days instead of 365. Let me try that.

8/360=0.022222.

13,560 *0.065=881.4.

881.4 * 0.022222 ≈ 19.6.

So discount ≈19.60.

Collection fee is 13.56.

Total deductions: 19.60 +13.56=33.16.

Proceeds: 13,560 -33.16=13,526.84.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating the time. Let me double-check the days between August 30 and September 7.

August 30 to August 31 is 2 days (30 and 31?), no, wait August 30 is the starting point, so August 30 is day 0, then August 31 is day 1, September 1 is day 2, up to September 7, which is day 8. So yes, 8 days. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong rate. The draft has an interest rate of 6%, but the bank is discounting at 6.5%. So perhaps the discount is based on the bank's rate, not the draft's rate.

Wait, yes, that's correct. The discounting rate is 6.5%, so I used that correctly.

Wait, maybe the collection fee is applied to the proceeds after discount, not to the face value. So perhaps the calculation is:

Proceeds after discount = face value - discount.

Then, the collection fee is applied to that amount.

So, let's recalculate.

Discount = 13,560 * 0.065 * (8/365) ≈19.30.

Proceeds before fee: 13,560 -19.30=13,540.70.

Collection fee: 13,540.70 * 0.001=13.54.

Proceeds =13,540.70 -13.54≈13,527.16.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is a flat fee, not a percentage. But the problem says it's (1/10)%, which is 0.1%, so it must be a percentage.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Maybe the proceeds are the present value of the face value minus the collection fee.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest on the draft is 6% per annum, so when the draft is discounted, the interest that would have accrued up to the discount date is calculated and subtracted.

Wait, perhaps the face value includes the interest from July 10 to September 7, which is 90 days.

So, first, calculate the interest on the face value.

Wait, the face value is $13,560, which may include the interest. So maybe the proceeds should consider that.

Wait, no, I think the face value is the amount that the buyer must pay, which includes the interest. So when the seller discounts the draft, the bank will calculate the present value based on the discount rate.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the present value using the discount rate of 6.5% for the remaining 8 days.

So the present value would be 13,560 / (1 + 0.065*(8/365)).

Let me compute this.

First, calculate the denominator:

0.065 * (8/365) = 0.065 * 0.0219178 ≈0.001425.

So denominator is 1 + 0.001425 ≈1.001425.

So present value is 13,560 /1.001425 ≈?

Let me compute that. 13,560 divided by 1.001425.

Approximately, 13,560 * (1/1.001425) ≈13,560 * 0.99858 ≈13,527.14.

Then subtract the collection fee of 0.1%, which is 13,527.14 *0.001=13.527.

So proceeds would be 13,527.14 -13.527≈13,513.61.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the interest on the draft is 6%, and the discount rate is 6.5%, so the effective rate is higher, leading to a lower proceeds.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: $13,720.50

B: $13,763.40

C: $13,560

D: $13,580.80

E: $203.40

F: $13,615.55

G: $13,652.72

H: $13,750.60

I: $13,500.00

J: $13,840.30

Wait, all the options except C and I are higher than 13,500, which doesn't make sense because discounting would reduce the proceeds below face value, but option C is exactly 13,560, which is the face value, and I is 13,500, which is lower.

Wait, but my calculations are leading to around 13,527, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the interest on the draft is 6%, so the face value is the invoice amount plus interest. So the invoice amount is
