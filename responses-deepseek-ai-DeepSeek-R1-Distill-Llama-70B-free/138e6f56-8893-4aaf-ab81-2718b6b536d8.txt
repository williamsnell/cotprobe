Okay, so I've got this question here about the Third Agricultural Revolution and which crop started it. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my history, but let's try to think this through.

First, I remember that there were a few agricultural revolutions. The First Agricultural Revolution was the Neolithic Revolution, where people started domesticating plants and animals. Crops like wheat, barley, and legumes were big then. Then, the Second Agricultural Revolution happened during the Middle Ages, I think, with improvements in technology like the heavy plow and three-field crop rotation. This increased yields and allowed for population growth.

Now, the question is about the Third Agricultural Revolution. From what I recall, this was more recent, probably in the 20th century. I think it's associated with the Green Revolution. Oh right, the Green Revolution involved developing high-yield crop varieties, especially wheat and rice, but also other crops. But wait, the Green Revolution was a part of the Third Agricultural Revolution, which started in the mid-20th century.

But the question is specifically about which crop began it. The options are wheat, quinoa, potatoes, corn, rye, oats, rice, millet, barley.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. The Green Revolution is known for wheat and rice. Norman Borlaug developed high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties in Mexico, which led to huge increases in production. So wheat was a major player. But the question is about which crop began the revolution. So maybe wheat is the answer, option A.

But then I think about other revolutions. The potato was a big deal during the European Agricultural Revolution in the 18th century, which some might consider part of the Second or leading into the Third. But I think the Third is more about the 20th-century Green Revolution. So maybe it's wheat.

Wait, but corn is a major crop too. Did the Third Revolution start with corn? Or was it more about wheat and rice? I'm not too sure. Let me think again. The Green Revolution is often linked with wheat and rice because those were the primary focuses, especially in regions like India and Mexico. So I'm leaning towards wheat as the crop that began it.

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the Third Agricultural Revolution as the one that began with the development of hybrid corn in the early 20th century. Hybrid corn was a big deal in increasing yields, and that was part of the lead-up to the Green Revolution. So maybe corn, option D, is the answer.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to clarify the timeline. The Third Agricultural Revolution is sometimes referred to as the Green Revolution, which started in the 1940s and 50s. It involved not just high-yielding varieties but also irrigation, fertilizers, pesticides, and machinery.

Hybrid corn was developed earlier, in the 1920s-1930s. So perhaps that was part of the lead-up but not the start of the Third Revolution. The Green Revolution's key crops were wheat, maize (corn), and rice. But the initial breakthroughs were with wheat. Borlaug's work in Mexico in the 1940s led to the development of high-yield wheat, which then spread to other countries. So maybe wheat was the starting point.

Looking at the options, A is wheat, D is corn. I'm a bit torn, but I think the correct answer is wheat because the Green Revolution began with wheat. So the answer would be A.

The Third Agricultural Revolution, often associated with the Green Revolution, began in the mid-20th century. This period focused on developing high-yield crop varieties, improved irrigation, fertilizers, and machinery. Norman Borlaug's work in Mexico during the 1940s and 1950s led to the development of high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties, which were pivotal in initiating this revolution. While corn and rice were also significant, wheat is often credited as the crop that began the Third Agricultural Revolution.

Answer: A
