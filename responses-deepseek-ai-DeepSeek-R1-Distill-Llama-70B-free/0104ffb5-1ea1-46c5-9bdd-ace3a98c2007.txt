Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to find the kinetic energy of an automobile. Hmm, I remember kinetic energy is the energy an object has because of its motion. The formula for kinetic energy is KE = ½ mv², right? But wait, I need to make sure all the units are correct because the car's weight is given in pounds and the speed is in miles per hour. Oh right, in physics, we usually work in metric units like kilograms and meters per second.

Alright, let's start by breaking down the problem. The car's weight is 2000 pounds. Wait, weight is a force, and in physics, mass is what we need for kinetic energy. I think weight in pounds is actually the force due to gravity, so to get mass, I need to divide by the acceleration due to gravity. Oh wait, but sometimes in such problems, people might use weight in pounds as a mass, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, no, in the English system, sometimes people use slugs as the unit of mass, where weight in pounds equals mass in slugs multiplied by 32.174 ft/s² (the acceleration due to gravity). So maybe I should convert pounds to kilograms or to slugs.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should convert the weight from pounds to kilograms. But wait, weight in pounds is a force, so to get mass in kilograms, I can use the conversion factor where 1 pound is approximately 0.453592 kilograms, but that's mass. Wait no, wait. Wait, no, 1 pound is a unit of force. So to convert weight in pounds-force to mass in kilograms, I think I need to divide by the acceleration due to gravity in appropriate units.

Wait no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The car's weight is 2000 pounds. Weight is a force, so in metric terms, force is in Newtons. So 1 pound-force is about 4.44822 Newtons. So 2000 pounds-force would be 2000 * 4.44822 N. That would give the force, which is mass times acceleration due to gravity. So mass m = force / g.

Wait, but g is 9.8 m/s². So m = (2000 lb) * (4.44822 N/lb) ) / 9.8 m/s². Let me compute that.

Alternatively, I remember that 1 slug is the mass that accelerates at 1 foot per second squared when a force of 1 pound is applied. So maybe I can find the mass in slugs first, then convert to kilograms.

Wait, perhaps an easier approach is to use the conversion from pounds to kilograms directly, but I'm not sure if that's correct because pounds are a unit of force, not mass. So to get mass, I need to relate it through gravity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to treat the weight in pounds as mass in some unit, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can look for a way to convert the weight directly.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to convert the speed from miles per hour to meters per second, and the weight to kilograms, then plug into the KE formula.

So let's outline the steps:

1. Convert weight from pounds to kilograms.
2. Convert speed from mph to m/s.
3. Calculate KE using (1/2)mv².
4. Convert the result to ergs as well.

Wait, but how do I convert weight in pounds to mass in kg? Since weight is force, F = m * g. So m = F / g.

So F in Newtons: 2000 lb * 4.44822 N/lb = 2000 * 4.44822 = let me calculate that.

2000 *4 is 8000, 2000*0.44822 is 896.44, so total is 8896.44 N.

So m = F/g = 8896.44 N / 9.8 m/s².

Let me compute that: 8896.44 divided by 9.8.

Hmm, 9.8 * 900 = 8820. So 8896.44 -8820=76.44. 76.44 /9.8 is approx 7.8. So total is about 900 +7.8=907.8 kg. So approximately 907.8 kg.

Wait, let me do it more accurately: 8896.44 / 9.8.

Well, 8896.44 ÷ 9.8.

Let me compute 9.8 * 900 = 8820, 9.8*907= let's see 900*9.8=8820, 7*9.8=68.6, so 8820+68.6=8888.6. That's very close to 8896.44.

So 907 *9.8=8888.6. The difference is 8896.44-8888.6=7.84. So 7.84/9.8=0.8. So m=907.8 kg.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use exact calculation:

m = (2000 lb) * (4.44822 N/lb) / 9.8 m/s²

So 2000 *4.44822 = 8896.44 kg·m/s²? Wait no, 2000 lb is force, so 2000 lb *4.44822 N/lb gives Newtons, which is kg·m/s².

So m=8896.44 /9.8 = let's compute it.

Compute 8896.44 ÷ 9.8:

Well, 9.8 × 900 = 8820. So 8896.44 -8820=76.44.

76.44 ÷9.8=7.8 (since 9.8*7=68.6, 9.8*0.8=7.84, which adds up to 76.44 exactly).

So m=900 +7.8=907.8 kg.

Okay, so mass is approximately 907.8 kg.

Next, the speed is 50 mph. Need to convert that to m/s.

I remember that 1 mile is 1609.34 meters, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds.

So 50 mph = 50 miles per hour.

So in m/s, that's (50 * 1609.34) / 3600.

Let me compute that.

50 *1609.34 = 80,467 meters per hour.

Divide by 3600 seconds: 80467 / 3600 ≈ let's compute.

3600 *22=79200. 80467-79200=1267.

1267 /3600 ≈ 0.3519.

So 22.3519 m/s.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

50 * 1609.34 = 50*1600=80,000 plus 50*9.34=467, so total 80,467 meters per hour.

Now 80,467 divided by 3600.

Let me compute 80,467 / 3600.

3600 * 22 = 79200, subtract that from 80467: 80467 -79200=1267.

Now, 1267 / 3600 = approx 0.3519.

So total is 22.3519 m/s. Let's approximate it as 22.35 m/s.

Now, compute KE = 0.5 * m * v².

So m=907.8 kg, v=22.35 m/s.

v squared is (22.35)^2.

Let me compute that.

22 squared is 484. 0.35^2 is 0.1225. Then, cross terms: 2 *22*0.35=15.4.

So (22 + 0.35)^2 = 22² + 2*22*0.35 + 0.35² = 484 + 15.4 + 0.1225 = 499.5225 m²/s².

So KE = 0.5 * 907.8 * 499.5225.

Compute 0.5 * 907.8 = 453.9.

Now 453.9 * 499.5225.

Hmm, that's a big multiplication. Let me see.

Alternatively, approximate 499.5225 as 500 - 0.4775.

So 453.9 * 500 = 453.9 *5 *100= 2269.5 *100= 226950.

Now subtract 453.9 * 0.4775.

Compute 453.9 *0.4=181.56, 453.9*0.0775= approx 35.18. So total 181.56+35.18=216.74.

So subtract 216.74 from 226950: 226950 - 216.74 = 226733.26.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps 453.9 * 499.5225 = 453.9 * (500 - 0.4775) = 453.9*500 -453.9*0.4775.

Compute 453.9 *500=226,950.

453.9 * 0.4775: let's compute 453.9 *0.4=181.56, 453.9 *0.07=31.773, 453.9 *0.0075=3.40425. Sum these: 181.56 +31.773=213.333, +3.40425=216.73725.

So subtract 216.73725 from 226950: 226950 - 216.73725 = 226,733.26275.

So KE ≈ 226,733.26 Joules, or approximately 2.2673326 ×10^5 J.

Looking at the options, option G is 2.27 × 10^5 J and 2.27 ×10^12 ergs. That seems to match.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, let's double-check the mass calculation. 2000 lb is 2000 *4.44822 N = 8896.44 N. Mass m = F/g = 8896.44 /9.8 = 907.8 kg. That's correct.

Speed: 50 mph = 22.35 m/s. Correct.

KE = 0.5 * 907.8 * (22.35)^2.

Compute (22.35)^2: 22^2=484, 2*22*0.35=15.4, 0.35^2=0.1225. So 484+15.4=499.4 +0.1225=499.5225 m²/s².

Then 0.5 *907.8 = 453.9 kg.

453.9 * 499.5225 = let's compute 453.9 *500 =226950, minus 453.9*(500-499.5225)=453.9*0.4775.

As before, 453.9 *0.4775 ≈216.737.

So 226950 -216.737 ≈226,733 J, which is 2.26733e5 J. So option G is 2.27e5 J.

Now, for part (b), converting Joules to ergs. I know that 1 J =10^7 ergs (since 1 J=1 kg m²/s², and 1 erg=1 g cm²/s². So 1 kg=10^3 g, 1 m=10^2 cm. So 1 m²=10^4 cm². So 1 J=1 kg m²/s² = (10^3 g) (10^4 cm²/s²) )=10^7 ergs.

So 2.26733e5 J *1e7 erg/J= 2.26733e12 ergs.

So part (b) is 2.27e12 ergs.

Looking back at the options, option G is 2.27 ×10^5 J, 2.27 ×10^12 ergs. So that's the correct answer.

To calculate the kinetic energy of the automobile, we use the formula for kinetic energy:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

### Step 1: Convert the weight to mass
The weight of the automobile is given as 2000 pounds. Since weight is a force, we use the relationship \( F = m \cdot g \) to find the mass. Converting pounds to kilograms:

1. Convert pounds to Newtons:  
   \[
   F = 2000 \, \text{lb} \times 4.44822 \, \text{N/lb} = 8896.44 \, \text{N}
   \]

2. Divide by the acceleration due to gravity \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \):  
   \[
   m = \frac{8896.44}{9.8} \approx 907.8 \, \text{kg}
   \]

### Step 2: Convert speed to meters per second
The speed is given as 50 miles per hour. Converting to meters per second:

1. Convert miles to meters:  
   \[
   1 \, \text{mile} = 1609.34 \, \text{meters}, \quad 50 \, \text{miles} = 50 \times 1609.34 = 80,467 \, \text{meters}
   \]

2. Convert hours to seconds:  
   \[
   1 \, \text{hour} = 3600 \, \text{seconds}, \quad v = \frac{80,467}{3600} \approx 22.35 \, \text{m/s}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the kinetic energy
Using the formula \( KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \):

1. Compute \( v^2 \):  
   \[
   v^2 = (22.35)^2 \approx 499.52 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
   \]

2. Compute \( KE \):  
   \[
   KE = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 907.8 \cdot 499.52 \approx 226,733 \, \text{J}
   \]

   In scientific notation:  
   \[
   KE \approx 2.27 \times 10^5 \, \text{J}
   \]

### Step 4: Convert to ergs
Since \( 1 \, \text{J} = 10^7 \, \text{ergs} \):  
\[
KE = 2.27 \times 10^5 \, \text{J} \times 10^7 \, \text{erg/J} = 2.27 \times 10^{12} \, \text{ergs}
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the automobile is approximately \( 2.27 \times 10^5 \, \text{J} \) and \( 2.27 \times 10^{12} \, \text{ergs} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**G: \( 2.27 \times 10^5 \, \text{J}, 2.27 \times 10^{12} \, \text{ergs} \)**

Answer: G
