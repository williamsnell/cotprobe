Okay, so I've got this question about psychotherapy approaches and cultural sensitivity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that culturally sensitive approaches try to understand a client's experience within their cultural context. So, it's about looking at things from the client's own perspective, right? I remember that in anthropology, there are terms like emic and etic. Emic is the insider's view, like how the culture sees itself, and etic is the outsider's perspective, more objective or analytical.

So, if we're talking about understanding the client's experience within their own culture, that sounds like an emic perspective. Because it's about their own beliefs and meanings, not imposing an external framework.

Wait, the options are A to J. Looking at the options, F is emic and D is etic. So the answer should be F.

I think that makes sense because traditional approaches might use an etic perspective, applying universal theories without considering the specific cultural context. But culturally sensitive approaches would use emic to stay within the client's cultural framework.

The correct answer is F: emic.

Culturally sensitive approaches in psychotherapy focus on understanding a client's experience from their own cultural perspective, which aligns with the emic perspective. This is in contrast to the etic perspective, which is more about an outsider's objective view.

Answer: F
