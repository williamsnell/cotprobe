Question:

In 1985, a widow, the undisputed owner of a cottage, leased it to a tenant for a term of seven years. Rent was to be paid in installments due on the first day of each month. One year later, in 1986, the widow died leaving no heirs. In her will, the widow left her entire estate to the Boy Scouts of America. The cottage was not specifically mentioned in the will. One month after the widow died, the tenant, having learned of her death, decided to remain on the property, but stopped paying rent. The Boy Scouts of America organization was unaware that the widow made a gift to the organization until 2009, when attorneys for the organization conducted an inventory of testamentary gifts to the Boy Scouts of America, which revealed that they had a claim to ownership of the cottage. The statutory period for adverse possession in this jurisdiction is 20 years. The tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run when

Options:

A: the Boy Scouts of America discovered the gift in the will.
B: the tenant's lease with the widow expired.
C: the tenant first moved into the cottage.
D: the widow left no heirs.
E: the widow died.
F: the tenant initially signed the lease.
G: the widow first leased the cottage.
H: the Boy Scouts of America took legal action.
I: the tenant discontinued paying rent.
J: the tenant subjectively believed that he no longer had permission to possess the cottage.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out when the tenant's statutory period for adverse possession began to run. Let me break this down step by step. 

First, I remember that adverse possession requires certain elements: the trespasser must be in actual possession, it must be open and notorious, continuous, exclusive, and hostile (against the true owner's rights). The key here is the "hostile" part, which usually means without the owner's permission.

In this case, the widow leased the cottage to the tenant for seven years starting in 1985. So the lease runs from 1985 to 1992. The tenant was paying rent monthly until the widow died in 1986. After her death, the tenant stopped paying rent but remained on the property. 

Now, the widow's estate went to the Boy Scouts of America because she died intestate (no heirs) and her will left everything to them, even though the cottage wasn't specifically mentioned. The tenant found out about her death a month later and decided not to pay rent anymore.

The question is about when the adverse possession period starts. The statutory period is 20 years, so we need to find when the tenant's claim under adverse possession began.

Under the lease, the tenant had legal permission to be there. So up until the lease ends in 1992, he's a tenant, not a trespasser. So any time before 1992, he can't claim adverse possession because he's there with permission.

But wait, the widow died in 1986, and the lease was supposed to run until 1992. So after her death, does the lease continue? I think when the owner dies, the lease typically continues with the new owner, which in this case would be the Boy Scouts. But the tenant stopped paying rent right after she died. Does that matter?

So, perhaps the lease was still in effect, so the tenant's possession was still with permission until the lease ended. But wait, the tenant's permission comes from the widow, and after she died, the new owner is the Boy Scouts. But the tenant didn't have a lease with the Boy Scouts; he had it with the widow. So when she died, the lease would transfer to the estate, which is now the Boy Scouts. 

If the tenant continued to stay without paying rent after the lease ended in 1992, that might be when the trespass begins. But wait, the tenant stopped paying rent in 1986, right after the widow died. So from 1986 onward, he didn't pay, but he was still in possession under the lease. 

Wait, but the lease was for seven years, so it's a fixed term. The tenant's obligation to pay rent was under the lease, so if he stops paying, that's a breach of the lease, but it doesn't automatically terminate the lease. Unless the landlord (now the Boy Scouts) takes action. But the Boy Scouts didn't know about the cottage until 2009, so they didn't do anything about it.

So, the tenant's lease ends in 1992. If he stays beyond that without a new lease, that's when he becomes a trespasser. Because after the lease ends, he doesn't have permission anymore. So his adverse possession would start in 1992.

Wait, but the question is when the statutory period began. So the period starts when he starts possessing without permission. So if the lease ended in 1992, that's when his permission ends, so the period starts then.

But wait, what if the tenant's lease was still valid, but he stopped paying rent? Then, the Boy Scouts could have taken action for eviction, but they didn't. So as far as the law is concerned, the lease is still in effect until it expires. So the tenant's possession is still with the permission of the owner (now the Boy Scouts through the estate) until 1992.

So the adverse possession period would start in 1992 when the lease ends. Because that's when the tenant's right to stay ends, and any continued possession is without permission.

Looking at the options, option B says "the tenant's lease with the widow expired." So that would be 1992, which seems right.

But wait, another angle: when the widow died, the ownership passed to the Boy Scouts. The tenant's lease was with the widow, so does the lease automatically transfer to the new owner? I think under property law, leases are binding on successors unless the lease says otherwise. So the Boy Scouts would have the same rights as the widow, and the tenant's lease would continue until 1992.

Therefore, the tenant's possession without permission starts when the lease ends in 1992. So the adverse possession period starts then.

So the answer should be B.

Another thought: could the period start earlier? Like when the tenant stopped paying rent in 1986. But no, because he was still a tenant with a lease. Not paying rent is a breach, but doesn't mean he's a trespasser. The lease is still in effect until it ends. So the possession is still permissive until the lease term ends.

Thus, the period starts when the lease expires, which is option B.

The statutory period for adverse possession begins when the tenant's possession becomes hostile to the true owner's rights, meaning without permission. Here, the tenant had a valid lease with the widow until 1992. Despite stopping rent payments in 1986, the lease remained in effect, and the tenant's possession was still permissive until the lease expired. After the lease ended in 1992, the tenant's continued occupation without a new lease constituted trespass, and the adverse possession period started.

Option B correctly identifies that the statutory period began when the tenant's lease with the widow expired.
