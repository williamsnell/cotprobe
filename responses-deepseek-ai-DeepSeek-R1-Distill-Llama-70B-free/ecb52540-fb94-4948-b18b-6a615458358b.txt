Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still trying to get the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about the Space Shuttle orbiting Earth, and we need to find the acceleration due to Earth's gravity that the shuttle experiences. The given data is that the shuttle is 300 km above Earth's surface, and Earth's radius is 6400 km. The options are from A to J, each with different values.

Hmm, I remember that acceleration due to gravity near the Earth's surface is about 9.8 m/s². But wait, the shuttle is in orbit, so it's much higher up. I think gravity decreases with altitude. Oh right, because the gravitational force depends on the distance from the center of the Earth.

So the formula for gravitational acceleration is g = G*M/(r²), where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, and r is the distance from Earth's center to the object. But wait, do I remember the right formula? Or is it that the acceleration due to gravity at a distance r is g' = g*(R/r)², where R is Earth's radius and r is the distance from the center.

Wait, let me think. The Earth's radius is 6400 km, so the shuttle is at 6400 + 300 = 6700 km from the center. So the distance r is 6,700,000 meters because I should convert km to meters for SI units, right?

The standard gravity g on Earth's surface is 9.8 m/s². So the formula for g at a height h above the Earth's surface would be g' = g * (R/(R+h))². Yeah, that sounds right because as h increases, g' decreases.

So plugging in the numbers: R is 6400 km which is 6,400,000 meters, and h is 300,000 meters. So R + h is 6,700,000 meters. So R/(R+h) is 6400000 / 6700000. Let me compute that.

Wait, perhaps simplifying before calculating. 6.4e6 / 6.7e6. Let's compute 6.4/6.7. Hmm, 6.4 is less than 6.7. Let's see, 6.4/6.7 is approximately 0.9552. Wait, 6.7 divided by 6.4 would be around 1.046, but wait no, wait, 6.4 is 64/67. Let me compute 64 divided by 67. Let's see, 67*0.955=63.8 (approx). Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 64/67. Let me do it on paper. 67 into 64.000. 67 goes into 640 nine times (67*9=603). 640-603=37. Bring down 0: 370. 67*5=335. 370-335=35. Bring down 0: 350. 67*5=335 again. 350-335=15. So so far, 0.955... So 0.955 approximately.

So (R/(R+h))² is (0.955)^2. Let me compute that. 0.955 squared is about 0.912. So 9.8 * 0.912 is approximately?

9.8 * 0.9 = 8.82, and 9.8 * 0.012 is about 0.1176. So adding them gives 8.82 + 0.1176 = 8.9376, which is approximately 8.94 m/s².

Looking at the options, option B is 8.9, so that's close. But wait, let me double-check my calculations for any possible mistakes.

Wait, another way to compute (6400/(6400+300))^2. So 6400+300=6700. So 6400/6700. Let me compute that as a decimal.

6400 /6700 = 64/67 ≈ 0.9552. Squaring that gives (0.9552)^2 ≈ 0.9126. Then multiply by 9.8: 9.8 * 0.9126.

Let me calculate 9.8 * 0.9 = 8.82. 9.8 * 0.0126 = approx 0.12348. So adding them gives 8.82 + 0.12348 ≈ 8.94348, which is about 8.94. So the closest option is B: 8.9 m/s².

But wait, I remember that the actual value might be a bit different. Alternatively, perhaps using a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps using exact numbers. Let's compute 6400/(6400+300) = 6400/6700. Let me write it as 64/67. So (64/67)^2 = (4096)/(4489). Let me compute 4096 ÷ 4489.

Wait, 4096 ÷ 4489 is approximately 0.9126. So, 9.8 * 0.9126 = ?

Let me compute 9 * 0.9126 = 8.2134, and 0.8 * 0.9126 = 0.73008. Adding them: 8.2134 + 0.73008 = 8.94348. So about 8.94348 m/s², which rounds to 8.94, so option B is 8.9, which is the closest.

Wait, but another approach: Maybe using the formula with the center distance. So g' = G*M/(r²), but GM is the same as g*R², where g is 9.8. So g' = g*(R/r)^2, which is the same as before. So yes, same result.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use another method. Oh wait, sometimes in these problems, people approximate g as 10 m/s², but that's not necessary here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for circular orbits, where the acceleration is provided by the centripetal force, which is due to gravity. So a = (4π² r)/T², but wait, I don't know the period T here, so that might complicate things. So it's better to stick with the inverse square law approach.

So, to sum up, the acceleration should be approximately 8.94 m/s², so the closest option is B, 8.9 m/s².

To determine the acceleration due to Earth's gravity experienced by the Space Shuttle orbiting 300 km above the Earth's surface, we use the formula for gravitational acceleration at a distance \( r \) from Earth's center:

\[
g' = g \cdot \left(\frac{R}{R + h}\right)^2
\]

Here:
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity at Earth's surface (\( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)),
- \( R \) is Earth's radius (\( 6400 \, \text{km} = 6,400,000 \, \text{m} \)),
- \( h \) is the altitude of the Space Shuttle above Earth's surface (\( 300 \, \text{km} = 300,000 \, \text{m} \)).

First, calculate the total distance from Earth's center to the Space Shuttle:

\[
r = R + h = 6,400,000 + 300,000 = 6,700,000 \, \text{m}.
\]

Next, compute the ratio \( \frac{R}{r} \):

\[
\frac{R}{r} = \frac{6,400,000}{6,700,000} \approx 0.9552.
\]

Square this ratio:

\[
\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^2 \approx (0.9552)^2 \approx 0.9126.
\]

Now, calculate the acceleration due to gravity at the Shuttle's altitude:

\[
g' = g \cdot \left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^2 = 9.8 \cdot 0.9126 \approx 8.94 \, \text{m/s}^2.
\]

Finally, compare this result to the given options. The closest value is **8.9 m/s²**, which corresponds to option **B**.
