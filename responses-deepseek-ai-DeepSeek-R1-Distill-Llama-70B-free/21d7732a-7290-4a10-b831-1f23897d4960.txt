Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about double-slit diffraction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about Fraunhofer diffraction, right? I remember Fraunhofer is the far-field diffraction, where the light is all coming from a point source or something.

The problem gives me the wavelength, lambda, as 480 nm. Oh wait, that's 4800 Angstroms, but I guess that's just for clarity. The distance from the slits to the screen is 50 cm. Oh, and the slit separation d is 0.10 mm. Slit width a is 0.02 mm. They're asking for two things: the fringe spacing between the bright fringes, and the linear distance from the central maximum to the first minimum of the envelope.

Wait, wait. So first, I think I should calculate the fringe spacing due to the double-slit interference, and then find the position of the first minimum due to the single-slit diffraction. Because in double-slit, you have both interference and diffraction effects.

Right, the formula for the fringe spacing (y) in a double-slit setup is y = (lambda * L) / d, where L is the distance to the screen. But wait, that's for the bright fringes. Because for double-slit interference, the bright spots are spaced by y = (m lambda L)/d, where m is the order. So the spacing between adjacent fringes (m=1 and m=0) would be delta y = lambda L / d.

Wait, but wait. No, that's actually the formula for the Young's double-slit experiment, which is interference. But the problem is about Fraunhofer diffraction, which I think is when you have a single slit. Oh wait, no, Fraunhofer is the diffraction pattern from any aperture, but double-slit would be a diffraction pattern modulated by interference.

But in any case, the first part is about the fringe spacing, which I think is the spacing between the bright spots caused by interference.

So let's compute that first. Lambda is 480 nm, which is 480e-9 meters. L is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters. d is 0.10 mm, which is 0.10e-3 meters or 1e-4 m.

So the formula y = (lambda * L) / d.

Plugging in the numbers: (480e-9 m * 0.5 m) / (1e-4 m) = (240e-9) / 1e-4 = 240e-5 meters. Because 480e-9 * 0.5 is 240e-9, divided by 1e-4 is 240e-5. 240e-5 meters is 2.4e-3 meters, which is 2.4 mm. So the fringe spacing is 2.4 mm. Hmm, looking at the options, I see option I has 2.4 mm as the first value.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the first part is the fringe spacing, but the second part is the distance from the central maximum to the first minimum of the fringe envelope. Oh, right, the envelope comes from the single-slit diffraction. So the envelope is determined by the single-slit pattern, and within each envelope maximum, you have the double-slit fringes.

The first minimum of the single-slit diffraction occurs at a certain angle theta, given by a sin(theta) = lambda. So the position on the screen is y = L tan(theta). But for small angles, tan(theta) approximates sin(theta), so y â‰ˆ L * sin(theta) = L * (lambda / a).

Wait, wait, a is the slit width. So a is 0.02 mm, which is 2e-5 meters.

So the position of the first minimum (envelope) is y_envelope = (lambda * L) / a.

Plugging in the numbers: (480e-9 m * 0.5 m) / (2e-5 m) = (240e-9) / 2e-5.

Let me compute that. 240e-9 divided by 2e-5 is (240/2) * (1e-9 / 1e-5) ) = 120 * 1e-4 = 1.2e-2 meters, which is 1.2 cm.

Wait, so the first minimum of the envelope is at 1.2 cm from the center. So the fringe spacing is 2.4 mm, and the envelope's first min is at 1.2 cm.

Looking back at the options, option I is 2.4 mm, 1.2 cm. So the answer should be I.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix anything up. The first part is the spacing between the bright fringes, which is the double-slit interference. The formula for that is indeed (lambda L)/d. Yep, that gives 2.4 mm.

Second part is the distance from central maximum to the first minimum of the envelope. That's the single-slit diffraction, and the first min is at (lambda L)/a. So (480e-9 * 0.5)/(0.02e-3) ?

Wait, 0.02 mm is 0.02e-3 meters, which is 2e-5 m. So yes, the calculation is as before, 1.2 cm.

So the correct option is I: 2.4 mm, 1.2 cm.

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation involving double-slit Fraunhofer diffraction. The problem asks for two quantities:

1. **Fringe spacing** due to double-slit interference.
2. **Linear distance from the central maximum to the first minimum of the fringe envelope**, which arises from single-slit diffraction.

### 1. Fringe Spacing (Double-Slit Interference)
The fringe spacing \( y \) is given by the formula:

\[
y = \frac{\lambda L}{d}
\]

Where:
- \( \lambda = 480 \, \text{nm} = 480 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \),
- \( L = 50 \, \text{cm} = 0.5 \, \text{m} \),
- \( d = 0.10 \, \text{mm} = 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
y = \frac{(480 \times 10^{-9}) \cdot 0.5}{1 \times 10^{-4}} = \frac{240 \times 10^{-9}}{1 \times 10^{-4}} = 240 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m} = 2.4 \, \text{mm}.
\]

Thus, the fringe spacing is \( 2.4 \, \text{mm} \).

---

### 2. Distance from Central Maximum to First Minimum of the Envelope (Single-Slit Diffraction)
The first minimum of the single-slit diffraction pattern occurs at an angle \( \theta \) given by:

\[
a \sin \theta = \lambda
\]

For small angles, \( \sin \theta \approx \tan \theta \), so the position \( y_{\text{envelope}} \) on the screen is approximately:

\[
y_{\text{envelope}} = L \cdot \tan \theta \approx L \cdot \frac{\lambda}{a}
\]

Where:
- \( a = 0.02 \, \text{mm} = 2 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m} \),
- \( \lambda = 480 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \),
- \( L = 0.5 \, \text{m} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
y_{\text{envelope}} = \frac{(480 \times 10^{-9}) \cdot 0.5}{2 \times 10^{-5}} = \frac{240 \times 10^{-9}}{2 \times 10^{-5}} = 120 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m} = 1.2 \, \text{cm}.
\]

Thus, the distance from the central maximum to the first minimum of the envelope is \( 1.2 \, \text{cm} \).

---

### Final Answer
The fringe spacing is \( 2.4 \, \text{mm} \), and the distance from the central maximum to the first minimum of the envelope is \( 1.2 \, \text{cm} \). Comparing these values with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**I: 2.4 mm, 1.2 cm**
