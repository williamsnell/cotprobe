Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about avoidance-avoidance conflicts. Hmm, I remember that in psychology, conflicts are a type of motivational challenge where a person experiences two or more opposing drives or goals. There are different types of conflicts, like approach-approach, approach-avoidance, and avoidance-avoidance. 

The question is about avoidance-avoidance conflicts, which I think means when a person is trying to avoid two different negative outcomes. Like, imagine being stuck between two bad options, and you don't want either. So, what happens in such a situation?

I recall that in such a conflict, the individual might exhibit certain behaviors. Let me think about the possible options. The options provided are A through J, each with two behaviors. The correct answer should list the two behaviors resulting from an avoidance-avoidance conflict.

Wait, I think one of the behaviors is vacillation. That makes sense because when you're avoiding two things, you might go back and forth between the options, trying to decide which one to take, but not making progress. Another behavior I remember is attempting to leave the field. That means the person might try to escape the situation entirely to avoid both negative outcomes.

Looking at the options, option H is "Vacillation and attempting to leave the field." That sounds right. Other options don't fit as well. For example, option A is indecision and escalation—escalation sounds more like an approach behavior rather than avoidance. Option B is aggression and passive resistance, which might be more related to approach-avoidance. Option C is procrastination and denial, which are more about avoiding a problem without necessarily being in a conflict between two negatives. Option D, displacement and rationalization, are defense mechanisms but not specific to this conflict. Option E is overcompensation and withdrawal—withdrawal could fit, but overcompensation seems different. Option F is negotiation and compromise, which are problem-solving strategies, not typical of avoidance conflicts. Option G is acceptance and engagement, which is the opposite of avoidance. Option I is submission and avoidance—submission is more of a specific reaction, not a general behavior in this context. Option J is confrontation and resolution, which again are not about avoiding both options.

So, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is H. The two behaviors are vacillation and attempting to leave, which matches what I remember about avoidance-avoidance conflicts.

The correct answer is H: Vacillation and attempting to leave the field. This is because an avoidance-avoidance conflict involves trying to avoid two negative outcomes, leading to behaviors like vacillating between options and attempting to escape the situation entirely.
