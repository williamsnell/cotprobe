Question:

A law school advertised in various law journals for a legal ethics and jurisprudence professor. Although a number of lawyers applied for the position, one of the applicants submitted a particularly impressive resume. The dean of faculty for the law school immediately wrote to the applicant to offer him the position. In the letter, the dean offered to employ the applicant for the upcoming academic year, which started on August 15, at a salary of $75,000. The letter also listed the employment terms and conditions, one of which stated that professors are entitled to five paid sick days during the year. The dean included a detailed employment contract containing all these terms, for the applicant's signature. After the applicant received this letter, he replied by mail, requesting a salary of $85,000 and sick leave of 10 days. Upon receipt of the applicant's letter, the dean telephoned the applicant and told him that the law school followed the American Bar Association guidelines with respect to salary and sick leave for its professors. The applicant acquiesced on the salary question, but insisted that his sick leave be extended to 10 days. The dean replied, "Let's not permit a minor issue to stand in the way of your coming to teach at our law school. In the event you require more than 5 sick days, I promise that the matter will be taken care of to your benefit. " The applicant informed the dean that he would sign the contract and forward it to the dean, which he promptly did. The applicant began teaching at the law school on August 15. Three months later, the applicant was out sick for five days with laryngitis. The applicant did not miss another school day until Monday, March 8, when he fell ill with food poisoning. This illness kept him home for five additional sick days. The applicant returned to work on March 15. When the applicant received his salary check at the end of the week, his check did not include payment for the previous week (from March 8 to March 12). Accompanying the check was a statement that read:"Salary payment for period from Monday, March 1 through Friday, March 19 with pro rata deduction to reflect five teaching days missed during said period. "When the applicant received his check, he immediately confronted the dean and requested full payment for the week of March 8 through 12. The dean responded, "I'm sorry, but there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. "The applicant asserted a claim against the law school for breach of contract. The applicant offers to introduce evidence that during his telephone conversation with dean of faculty, the dean promised, if necessary, to provide him with additional sick days. The most accurate statement concerning the dean's oral promise would be that

Options:

A: parol evidence is admissible to show that the parties assented to their written contract only as a partial integration of their complete contract.
B: parol evidence is admissible to prove the written contract was a mistake.
C: parol evidence is admissible to show the dean's personal guarantee of additional sick days.
D: parol evidence is admissible to show that the written contract was void due to lack of consideration.
E: parol evidence is inadmissible to prove any oral agreements made prior to the signing of the written contract.
F: parol evidence is admissible to show that the applicant misunderstood the terms of the contract.
G: parol evidence is admissible to prove the dean coerced the applicant into signing the contract.
H: parol evidence is admissible to show that the written contract is not enforceable, because of undue influence or fraud.
I: parol evidence is inadmissible to prove contemporaneous oral agreements that vary or contradict the terms of a written contract.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read through the problem again and think about what's going on here.

So, a law school advertised for a professor position. They got a bunch of applicants, and one guy had a really impressive resume. The dean wrote him a letter offering the job, starting August 15 with a salary of $75k. The letter included terms like five paid sick days and a detailed contract for him to sign.

The applicant replied by mail, asking for a higher salary ($85k) and more sick leave (10 days). The dean called him and said they follow ABA guidelines on salary and sick leave. The applicant agreed on the salary but wanted 10 sick days. The dean said, "Let's not let a minor issue stand in the way. If you need more than 5 days, I promise it'll be taken care of to your benefit." Then the applicant signed the contract and started working.

Three months in, he used 5 sick days. Then in March, he got sick again for another 5 days. So total 10. But when he got his check, it was deducted for 5 days. He confronted the dean, who said there's nothing he can do. Now the applicant is suing for breach of contract, and he wants to introduce evidence of the dean's oral promise about additional sick days.

The question is about whether parol evidence is admissible regarding that oral promise. The options are A to I, each suggesting different rules about parol evidence.

Okay, so I remember that the parol evidence rule generally says that when a written contract is intended to be the final and complete agreement (an integration), prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict or vary the terms aren't admissible. There are exceptions, though, like if there was a mistake, fraud, or if the written contract isn't the full agreement.

In this case, the written contract specified five sick days. But before signing, the dean made an oral promise to take care of additional days if needed. So the applicant is trying to use this promise to show that he's entitled to more sick days beyond the five.

Wait, but the contract was a written agreement, and it's likely that it's an integration. So under the parol evidence rule, any prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict the written terms aren't allowed unless an exception applies.

Looking at the options, option I says parol evidence is inadmissible to prove contemporaneous oral agreements that vary the written contract. That fits because the written contract is the final agreement, so the oral promise can't contradict it unless there's an exception.

Option E says parol evidence is inadmissible for any prior oral agreements, but I think E is broader than necessary. Because there are exceptions where parol evidence is allowed, like for fraud or mistake. So E might not be the correct answer.

Wait, but in this case, the dean's promise was contemporaneous, made during the negotiation before signing. The contract was then signed with the terms as five days. So since the contract is a full integration, the parol evidence rule would bar the introduction of the oral promise unless it's about something else.

So the correct reasoning is that the oral promise can't vary the terms of the written contract because it's an integration. Therefore, parol evidence isn't admissible, making I the correct answer.

Wait, another thought. Did the written contract include all the terms? The problem says the dean sent a detailed contract with all the terms, including the five sick days. So the written agreement was comprehensive, making it a full integration. Therefore, any prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict it are not admissible.

So the answer should be I: parol evidence is inadmissible to prove contemporaneous oral agreements that vary or contradict the written contract.

The parol evidence rule generally prohibits the introduction of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict or vary the terms of a written contract that is intended as a full and complete integration of the parties' agreement. In this case, the written contract specified five paid sick days, and the dean's oral promise to "take care of" additional sick days was contemporaneous to the negotiation of the contract. Since the contract was a detailed and comprehensive agreement, it is likely considered a full integration. Therefore, the dean's oral promise cannot be used to vary the terms of the written contract unless an exception applies, such as fraud or mistake, which are not present here. 

Among the options, the most accurate statement is that parol evidence is inadmissible to prove contemporaneous oral agreements that vary or contradict the terms of a written contract.
