Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about an isolated conductor with a net charge and a cavity containing a charged particle. Hmm. I remember that when dealing with conductors and cavities, there are some specific rules about how charges distribute themselves.

So, the conductor has a net charge of +10 x 10^-6 C. Wait, and there's a cavity inside this conductor, and inside that cavity is a particle with charge q = +3.0 x10^-6 C. The question is asking about the charge on the cavity wall.

I think I need to recall the concept of charges on conductors and how they behave with cavities. So, from what I remember, when a conductor has a cavity, the charge distribution depends on whether the cavity is empty or has a charge inside.

In this case, the cavity has a charged particle, so that must influence the charges on the cavity's walls. Oh right, I think when a cavity has a charge, the conductor's charges rearrange in response. But wait, the conductor is isolated, which means its total charge doesn't change; the charges just move around.

So, the conductor as a whole (the material of the conductor plus any charges inside the cavity) must have the net charge. But wait, the cavity is inside the conductor, so the charges inside the cavity are considered as inside the conductor.

Wait no, the conductor has its own charge, and the cavity's charge is separate. Let me think. The conductor is a material with free electrons and positive ions. The net charge on the conductor is +10 microcoulombs. But inside the cavity, which is a hollow part, there's a particle with +3 microcoulombs.

I think the rule is that the charges on the cavity walls must induce charges such that the electric field inside the conductor (the material part) is zero. So for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conducting material is zero.

So, the cavity has a charge q inside it. That charge will induce an opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity. Oh wait, wait. Let's get this straight. The particle inside the cavity has +3e-6 C. So the inner walls of the cavity must have an induced charge of -3e-6 C, right? Because the induced charges are opposite to the charge inside the cavity.

But wait, wait. Because the conductor is neutral overall except for its net charge. Hmm, no, the conductor itself has a net charge of +10e-6 C. So, the conductor's own charge is separate from the cavity's charge.

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: the total charge of the system (conductor + cavity contents) is the sum of the conductor's net charge and the charge in the cavity. Or is it the other way around?

Wait no, the conductor's net charge is given as +10e-6 C. The cavity is inside the conductor, and the particle inside the cavity contributes to the total charge of the system. So the total charge would be the conductor's charge plus the particle's charge. But wait, the conductor is isolated, so its net charge is fixed. So the conductor's net charge is +10e-6 C regardless of the cavity's contents.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The conductor is a separate entity. The cavity is a hole within it. The charge inside the cavity is +3e-6 C. So the conductor's net charge is +10e-6 C, but the presence of the +3e-6 C inside the cavity will induce charges on the walls of the cavity.

So the cavity's inner walls must have a charge induced by the +3e-6 C. So the inner surface of the cavity wall would have -3e-6 C. But then, what about the outer surface of the conductor?

Because the conductor as a whole is neutral except for its net charge. Wait, the conductor's net charge is +10e-6 C. So the sum of all charges in the conductor must be +10e-6 C.

So, the inner surface of the cavity wall has -3e-6 C (to cancel the electric field inside the conductor). But then, the conductor's material (the part outside the cavity) must have a charge that, when combined with the inner surface's charge and the cavity's charge, gives the net charge of the conductor.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the charge on the cavity walls is such that the conductor's outer surface must account for the net charge.

So, the charge inside the cavity is q=+3e-6 C. The inner walls of the cavity must have a charge induced. Let's call this inner charge q_inner. Then, the outer surface of the conductor will have a charge q_outer.

We know that the total charge on the conductor is the sum of q_inner and q_outer, plus any other charges? Wait, no. Because the conductor's own charge is +10e-6 C. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is a material with a net charge of +10e-6 C. The cavity inside it has a particle of charge +3e-6 C. So, the presence of this +3e-6 C will cause the inner walls of the cavity to have an induced charge of -3e-6 C. Because the electric field inside the conductor must be zero. So the inner surface must have a charge that cancels the field from the +3e-6 C charge.

So, the inner surface is -3e-6 C. Now, the conductor's net charge is +10e-6 C. The conductor's net charge is the sum of the charges on the outer surface plus the inner surface.

Wait, no. The conductor's net charge is the sum of all the charges on it. So the conductor's total charge = charge on outer surface + charge on inner surface.

Wait, but the charge inside the cavity is not part of the conductor's charge, right? Because the cavity is a hollow space within the conductor. So the conductor's charge is its own, and the cavity's content is a separate charge.

Wait, I'm getting a bit messed up here. Let's try to model this.

The conductor has a net charge of +10e-6 C. Inside the cavity, there's a particle with charge +3e-6 C. The cavity's walls are part of the conductor. So the inner walls will have an induced charge, and the outer surface will have some charge.

The total charge on the conductor is the sum of the inner and outer surface charges. Because the conductor itself is neutral except for this net charge.

So, the charge inside the cavity (q=+3e-6 C) induces a charge on the inner surface of the cavity walls. The induced charge is -q, so -3e-6 C. So the inner surface has -3e-6 C.

Then, the conductor's net charge is the sum of the inner surface charge and the outer surface charge.

So:

Net charge of conductor = inner surface charge + outer surface charge.

We know the net charge is +10e-6 C. The inner surface charge is -3e-6 C.

So:

10e-6 C = (-3e-6 C) + outer surface charge.

Solving for the outer surface charge: outer = 10e-6 +3e-6 = 13e-6 C.

Wait, but the question is about the charge on the cavity wall. The cavity wall has two surfaces: the inner surface and the outer surface. But wait, no: the cavity is entirely within the conductor. So the cavity walls (the inner surfaces) would have the induced charge opposite to the charge inside. But the question is asking specifically for the charge on the cavity wall. So, the cavity wall is the inner surface, right?

Wait, the question says, "charge on the cavity wall." The cavity wall is the inner surface of the conductor's cavity. So that's the inner surface, which we've determined is -3e-6 C.

Wait, but wait. Another approach. The total charge on the conductor (the material) is +10e-6 C. Inside the cavity, the charge is +3e-6 C. But the conductor's material must have a charge such that the sum of all charges inside (the cavity's charge plus the conductor's material charge) equals the net charge of the conductor.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think in terms of Gauss's Law. The conductor shields the outside from the cavity's charge. So the charge on the outer surface of the conductor must be equal to the sum of the conductor's net charge and the cavity's charge inside, because the charges inside the conductor (cavity) and the conductor's material are what contribute to the outer surface charge.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor's net charge is +10e-6 C. The cavity has a +3e-6 C charge. So the conductor's material must have charges that adjust due to the cavity's charge.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about this: the cavity's charge induces a charge on the cavity walls. So, the inner surface of the cavity wall has -3e-6 C. Then, the conductor's material (the bulk) must have a charge that, when added to the inner surface's charge, gives the conductor's net charge.

Wait, no. The conductor's net charge is +10e-6 C, which includes all the charges on it. So the conductor's net charge is the sum of the inner surface charge and the outer surface charge.

So, inner surface is -3e-6, and the outer surface must be +13e-6 C. Because 10e-6 = (-3e-6) + x â†’ x=13e-6.

But the question is specifically about the charge on the cavity wall. The cavity wall is the inner surface, so the charge there is -3e-6 C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -3e-6 C. But let me check this again.

Wait, the conductor's net charge is the sum of the charges on the outer surface and the inner surface (the cavity wall).

So,

Charge on conductor (Q) = Charge on outer surface (Q_outer) + Charge on inner surface (Q_inner)

Given that Q is +10e-6 C, and Q_inner is -3e-6 C (because the cavity has +3e-6 C inside, which induces -3e-6 C on the inner walls), then:

Q_outer = Q - Q_inner = 10e-6 - (-3e-6) = 13e-6 C.

So the outer surface has +13e-6 C. But the question is about the cavity wall, which is the inner surface, so that would be -3e-6 C.

But wait, the options don't have a positive 13e-6 except for option J. So the cavity wall charge is -3e-6 C, which is option B.

Wait, yes, that's right. So the correct answer should be B: -3.0e-6 C.

The problem involves an isolated conductor with a net charge of \( +10 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \) and a cavity containing a particle of charge \( q = +3.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \). The goal is to determine the charge on the cavity wall.

When a charged particle is inside a cavity within a conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the cavity wall. This is due to the rearrangement of charges in the conductor to maintain electrostatic equilibrium. Specifically, the charge on the inner surface of the cavity wall is \( -q = -3.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \).

The conductor's net charge is the sum of the charges on its outer surface and inner surface. Since the conductor's net charge is \( +10 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \), and the inner surface has \( -3.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \), the outer surface must have a charge of \( +13.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \) to balance the total charge. However, the question specifically asks for the charge on the cavity wall, which refers to the inner surface of the cavity. Therefore, the charge on the cavity wall is \( -3.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: \( -3.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C} \)**.
