Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about ethics, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The question is: "Under ethical ________ objective moral principles can be rationally determined, while ethical under ________ morality is both context dependent and subjective."

The options are A through J, each pairing two terms. My task is to choose the correct pair.

Hmm, I remember that in ethics, there are several theories about how moral principles are determined. The main ones I know are Absolutism, Relativism, Subjectivism, and maybe Normativity. Let me think about each of these.

First, the sentence has two blanks. The first part says that under ethical [blank], objective moral principles can be rationally determined. So I'm looking for a theory that supports the idea that there are objective, universal moral principles that can be known through reason.

Absolutism comes to mind. Ethical absolutism posits that certain actions are always right or always wrong, regardless of context. It's about objective moral standards. So under Absolutism, you can determine these principles rationally because they're universal and unchanging.

The second part of the question says that under [blank], morality is both context-dependent and subjective. That sounds like Relativism. Ethical relativism suggests that moral judgments are relative to the cultural, historical, or personal context. What's right or wrong depends on the situation or the individual's perspective, making morality subjective and varying across different contexts.

So putting that together, the first blank should be Absolutism and the second Relativism. Let me look at the options.

Option D: Absolutism, Relativism. That fits. Let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: Relativism first, which doesn't fit because Relativism doesn't support objective principles. So A is out.

Option B: Absolutism and Normativity. I'm not too sure about Normativity. I think Normativity refers to the study of norms, but I'm not certain how it fits here. The second part needs to be about subjectivity and context, so Normativity might not be the right term.

Option C: Subjectivism first. Wait, Subjectivism is the belief that morality is based on personal feelings or opinions. So under Subjectivism, principles are subjective, but the question's first part is about objective principles, so C doesn't fit.

Option D is looking good. Let me keep going to be thorough.

Option E: Normativity and Absolutism. Doesn't fit because the second part should be Relativism.

Option F: Normativity and Relativism. Maybe, but the first part is Normativity, which I'm not sure about. I think Normativity isn't about objective principles; it's more about norms and how they're established. So F is probably not correct.

Option G: Relativism first, which is wrong for the first blank. So G is out.

Option H: Both blanks Relativism. No, because the first part needs to be about objective principles, which Relativism doesn't support.

Option I: Both Absolutism. That would mean both blanks are Absolutism, but the second part of the question is about context-dependent and subjective morality, which doesn't align with Absolutism.

Option J: Absolutism and Subjectivism. Well, Subjectivism is about personal subjectivity, but the second part of the question is about context dependence. Relativism covers both context and subjectivity, I think, because it's about cultural or situational variation, which is broader than just individual subjectivity.

So the correct pair should be Absolutism and Relativism, which is option D.

The question asks about two ethical theories. The first part requires a theory that supports objective moral principles determined through reason, which aligns with **Absolutism**. The second part describes morality as context-dependent and subjective, which fits **Relativism**. Among the options, only **D: Absolutism, Relativism** correctly matches both parts of the question.

Answer: D
