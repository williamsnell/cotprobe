Question:

A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 40 minutes after he was involved in a motor vehicle collision. He was the unrestrained driver. He is conscious. Physical examination shows numerous lacerations and ecchymoses over the face. His vision is normal. Ocular, facial, and lingual movements are intact. The gag reflex is present. Sensation to pinprick is absent over the right side of the face anterior to the right ear, extending down along the full extent of the mandible to the chin. Sensation also is absent over the right side of the tongue. X-rays of the skull show fractures of the orbit, zygomatic arch, and infratemporal fossa. The most likely cause of these findings is a fracture affecting which of the following locations?

Options:

A: Stylomastoid foramen
B: Superior orbital fissure
C: Foramen lacerum
D: Optic canal
E: Foramen spinosum
F: Jugular foramen
G: Internal acoustic meatus
H: Foramen rotundum
I: Foramen ovale
J: Foramen magnum

Okay, so I have this medical question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the scenario is. A 24-year-old man was in a car accident, unrestrained, so he probably got hurt pretty badly. He's conscious, which is good, but he has a bunch of cuts and bruises on his face. His vision is normal, and his ocular, facial, and lingual movements are intact. That probably means the nerves controlling those functions are okay.

Wait, but then it says his sensation is absent over the right side of the face, specifically anterior to the ear, down the mandible to the chin. Also, the right side of the tongue has no sensation. So he can't feel pinpricks there. Hmm, so that points to some nerve damage causing loss of sensation in those areas.

The X-rays show fractures in the orbit, zygomatic arch, and infratemporal fossa. So those are all structures in the face and skull. I think the orbit is the eye socket, zygomatic arch is part of the cheekbone, and the infratemporal fossa is that area below the temple, maybe near the jaw.

So the question is asking which foramen (opening in the skull) is likely fractured, causing these symptoms.

I remember that nerves pass through various foramina, and if a fracture occurs there, it can damage the nerve. So I need to think about which nerves are responsible for the areas where he's lost sensation.

He has no sensation on the right side of the face anterior to the ear, down the mandible to the chin. That area is typically supplied by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve has three divisions: ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular. The mandibular division (V3) handles sensation for the lower face, including the jaw area, and also motor functions for chewing, like the muscles of mastication.

But wait, his facial movements are intact, so the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) is probably okay. Because if it were damaged, he might not be able to move his face normally, but here it says facial movements are fine.

He also has no sensation on the right side of the tongue. The sensory part of the tongue is handled by the lingual nerve, which is a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. So both the loss of sensation on the face and the tongue are pointing towards issues with the mandibular division (V3) of the trigeminal nerve.

So, if the mandibular nerve is affected, where would it be? The trigeminal nerve exits the skull through the foramen ovale. The mandibular division (V3) passes through the foramen ovale. If there's a fracture through this foramen, it could damage the nerve, leading to loss of sensation in its distribution area.

Let me think about the other options to make sure. Let's go through the choices:

A: Stylomastoid foramen — that's where the facial nerve exits. But facial movements are intact, so this isn't the issue.

B: Superior orbital fissure — this is where the ophthalmic branch (V1) of the trigeminal nerve passes, along with other nerves. But his vision is normal, and V1's area isn't mentioned as affected, so maybe not.

C: Foramen lacerum — I'm a bit fuzzy here. I think it's related to the internal carotid artery and maybe some nerves, but not the main ones for this scenario.

D: Optic canal — that's for the optic nerve. His vision is normal, so this isn't it.

E: Foramen spinosum — that's where the middle meningeal artery goes, I think. Not related to the trigeminal nerve's sensory areas.

F: Jugular foramen — that's for the glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X), and accessory (XI) nerves. If this were damaged, he might have trouble swallowing or with taste, maybe, but not the specific areas mentioned here.

G: Internal acoustic meatus — this is where the facial nerve and vestibulocochlear nerve enter. Not relevant here since hearing and facial movements are okay.

H: Foramen rotundum — this is where the maxillary division (V2) of the trigeminal nerve exits. If V2 were affected, he'd lose sensation on the cheek and upper lip, which isn't the case here.

I: Foramen ovale — yes, that's where V3 (mandibular) exits. So damage here would cause loss of sensation in the lower face and the tongue's anterior part, matching the symptoms.

J: Foramen magnum — that's where the spinal cord and some other structures pass. Not related to these symptoms.

So putting it all together, the fracture is likely affecting the foramen ovale. That would explain the loss of sensation in the areas supplied by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve.

The patient is a 24-year-old man involved in a motor vehicle collision, presenting with lacerations, ecchymoses, and normal vision. Ocular, facial, and lingual movements are intact, and the gag reflex is present. However, sensation to pinprick is absent over the right side of the face anterior to the ear, down the mandible to the chin, and over the right side of the tongue. Skull X-rays reveal fractures of the orbit, zygomatic arch, and infratemporal fossa. These findings suggest damage to the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3), which is responsible for sensation in the affected areas.

The mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve exits the skull through the foramen ovale. A fracture affecting this foramen would explain the loss of sensation in the distribution of V3, including the face and tongue. Other foramina were considered but ruled out based on the clinical findings:

- **A: Stylomastoid foramen** — Facial nerve exits here, but facial movements are intact.
- **B: Superior orbital fissure** — Involves the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, but vision and V1 sensation are normal.
- **C: Foramen lacerum** — Not directly related to the trigeminal nerve.
- **D: Optic canal** — Involves the optic nerve, but vision is normal.
- **E: Foramen spinosum** — Related to the middle meningeal artery, not the trigeminal nerve.
- **F: Jugular foramen** — Involves glossopharyngeal, vagus, and accessory nerves, but swallowing and taste are unaffected.
- **G: Internal acoustic meatus** — Involves the facial and vestibulocochlear nerves, but hearing and facial movements are normal.
- **H: Foramen rotundum** — Involves the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, but V2 sensation is unaffected.
- **J: Foramen magnum** — Involves the spinal cord and other structures, not relevant here.

The most likely cause of the findings is a fracture affecting the **foramen ovale**.
