Okay, so I have this question here about Theo losing his job at the public swimming pool when the pool closes for the winter. I need to figure out what type of unemployment this is. Let me think through the different types.

First, I remember that unemployment can be categorized in various ways. The main types I've heard about are structural, cyclical, frictional, seasonal, natural, underemployment, discouraged workers, jobless recovery, long-term, and involuntary.

Theo's job loss is because the pool closes for winter. That sounds like it's related to the time of year. Swimming pools are probably busier in summer and closed in winter, so this seems like a regular, recurring situation based on seasons.

So, seasonal unemployment must be when people lose their jobs due to changes in the seasons. It's temporary and happens every year at the same time. For example, ski resorts might lay off workers in the summer, or pools close in winter. So Theo's situation fits here.

Wait, what about the other options? Natural unemployment is the idea that there's always some level of unemployment in a healthy economy, like people moving between jobs. That doesn't seem to fit because this is about a specific cause.

Underemployment is when people are working less than they want, maybe part-time when they want full-time. Theo isn't working at all, so that's not it.

Discouraged workers are people who stop looking for work because they think they can't find any. Theo lost his job, but he might start looking again when summer comes, so he's not necessarily discouraged.

Structural unemployment is due to changes in the economy, like industries declining. Swimming pools closing seasonally isn't structural; it's a regular pattern.

Cyclical unemployment is tied to economic downturns, like recessions. If the economy is bad, demand drops. But here, it's specifically about the winter closure, which is a seasonal thing, not the economy's ups and downs.

Frictional unemployment is when people are between jobs, like quitting to look for a better one. Theo isn't choosing to leave; he's losing his job because the pool closes.

Jobless recovery is when the economy starts to grow, but employment doesn't increase much. That's more about economic recovery phases, not individual situations.

Long-term unemployment is when someone is jobless for a long period, say over six months. Theo's unemployment is seasonal, so it's temporary, not long-term.

Involuntary unemployment is when someone loses their job without choosing to, like getting laid off. Well, Theo is laid off because of the pool closing, so this is involuntary. But the question is asking for the specific type, not just whether it's voluntary or not.

So the options narrow down to G: seasonal unemployment and J: involuntary. Since the question is about the cause, seasonal makes sense because it's a regular, predictable event. Involuntary is more a description of the circumstance rather than the type.

Therefore, the correct answer should be G: seasonal unemployment.

Theo loses his job due to the seasonal closure of the swimming pool, which is a regular and predictable event based on the time of year. This fits the definition of seasonal unemployment, as it is temporary and occurs annually during specific seasons.

Answer: G
