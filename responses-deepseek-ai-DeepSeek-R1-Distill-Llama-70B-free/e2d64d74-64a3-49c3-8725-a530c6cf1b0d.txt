Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Kohlberg's theory of moral development. The question is asking which explanation best illustrates the conventional level of morality. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Kohlberg proposed three levels of moral development: pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional. Each level has two stages. The conventional level is the second one, where people base their moral decisions on societal expectations and rules.

So the question is about a 17-year-old driving at or below the speed limit. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason. I need to find which reason aligns with the conventional level.

Let me recall what the conventional level entails. At this level, people follow rules because they understand there's a social contract. They want to maintain social order and meet expectations of others. They also seek approval from society and may fear disapproval if they break the rules.

Looking at the options:

Option E says, "It's the law." That sounds like they're following the rule because it's the law, which is a societal norm. So that might fit the conventional level because they're adhering to the established rules of society.

Option G: "I don't want to get any tickets." That's more about avoiding punishment, which I think is part of the pre-conventional level. Pre-conventional is about avoiding punishment or getting rewards, so G is probably not the right choice.

Option F: "I want my parents to approve of my driving." This seems like seeking approval from specific others, which could be part of conventional morality since it's about societal expectations, but it's more about personal approval from parents rather than society at large. But I'm not entirely sure.

Option J: "I want to be a good example for my younger siblings." This is about setting a good example, which is more about societal expectations and maintaining social order, so that might be conventional as well.

Option E is about following the law, which is a direct societal rule. Option F is about parental approval, which is a specific social group. Option J is about being an example, which is more about societal role-modeling.

Wait, so in Kohlberg's stages, the conventional level includes stages like "good interpersonal relationships" and "maintaining the social order." Stage 3 is about gaining approval from others, and stage 4 is about upholding laws and social order.

So option E would fit stage 4, which is part of the conventional level. Option F is more stage 3, also conventional. Option J might also be stage 3.

The question is asking for the best illustration. So which one is more about societal rules versus personal relationships.

The question is about driving at the speed limit because of the law. So option E is directly about the law, which is societal. Option F is about parents, which is a more personal aspect.

So I think the correct answer is E. Alternatively, maybe J is also conventional, but E is more about societal laws, so it's a better fit.

Wait, let me make sure. The conventional level includes both stage 3 (seeking approval) and stage 4 (upholding laws). So both E and F could be conventional. But the question is which one best illustrates it.

Wait, the question is about why the person drives at the speed limit. So option E is doing it because it's the law, which is a societal rule. Option F is doing it to get parental approval, which is more about personal relationships.

Kohlberg's conventional level includes both, but the best example would be the one that directly relates to societal laws and rules, which is option E.

The question asks which explanation best illustrates Kohlberg's conventional level of morality. Kohlberg's conventional level involves moral decisions based on societal expectations, rules, and maintaining social order. 

- **Option E ("It's the law")**: This directly relates to following societal rules, which aligns with the conventional level, specifically stage 4, where upholding laws and social order is key.
- **Option F ("I want my parents to approve of my driving")**: This focuses on seeking approval from specific others, which is part of stage 3 of the conventional level but is more about personal relationships than societal rules.
- **Option J ("I want to be a good example for my younger siblings")**: This involves setting a societal example, which could fit stage 3 but is less directly tied to societal laws.

While both E and F relate to the conventional level, E is the best illustration because it directly involves adherence to societal laws, making it a clearer example of the conventional level.

Answer: E
