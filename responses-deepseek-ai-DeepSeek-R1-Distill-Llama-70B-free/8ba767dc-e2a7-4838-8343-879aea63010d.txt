Question:

Inherent risk and control risk differ from detection risk in which of the following ways?

Options:

A: Inherent risk and control risk can be completely eliminated.
B: Inherent risk and control risk exist as a result of the auditorâ€™s judgment about materiality.
C: Detection risk is a result of the auditor's judgment while inherent risk and control risk are not.
D: Inherent risk and control risk are the result of the client's internal control system.
E: Inherent risk and control risk exist independently of the audit.
F: Inherent risk and control risk are eliminated through the audit process.
G: Inherent risk and control risk are controlled by the auditor.
H: Inherent risk and control risk are solely determined by the audit.
I: Detection risk is controlled by the client while inherent risk and control risk are not.
J: Inherent risk and control risk are calculated by the client.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about audit risks. Hmm, the question is asking about the difference between inherent risk, control risk, and detection risk. I remember that these are the three main categories of audit risk. 

So, inherent risk is the risk that a material misstatement exists in the financial statements before considering the client's internal controls. Control risk is the risk that a material misstatement exists because the client's internal controls aren't effective. Detection risk is the risk that the auditor's procedures won't detect a material misstatement.

Wait, the question is about how inherent and control risk differ from detection risk. I think detection risk is under the auditor's control because it's about the effectiveness of their tests. So the auditor can influence detection risk by changing their procedures or sample sizes. But inherent and control risks are more about the client's situation and their internal controls, which the auditor can't really change. 

Looking at the options, I need to find which one correctly states this difference. Option E says inherent and control risk exist independently of the audit. That makes sense because they are factors outside the auditor's control. Detection risk, though, depends on the audit procedures, so it's not independent of the audit. 

Other options: Option C says detection risk is due to the auditor's judgment, which is true, but inherent and control risks are also based on the auditor's judgment about the client. So that's not the right way to differentiate. Option D says control risk is due to the client's internal controls, which is correct, but inherent risk isn't directly about the controls. Option E seems better because it captures both inherent and control risks as existing regardless of the audit process.

So the correct answer should be E.

The question asks how inherent risk and control risk differ from detection risk. Inherent risk is the likelihood of material misstatements due to client-specific factors, while control risk relates to the effectiveness of the client's internal controls. Detection risk, however, depends on the auditor's ability to detect misstatements through their procedures. 

Inherent and control risks exist independently of the audit process, as they are influenced by the client's circumstances and internal controls. In contrast, detection risk is directly tied to the auditor's actions and judgments. Among the options, E correctly states that inherent and control risks exist independently of the audit, distinguishing them from detection risk.

Answer: E
