Question:

If, after a conditioned response has been acquired, the procedureis changed so that the CS is repeatedly presented withoutbeing followed by the UCS, what is the result ?

Options:

A: Intermittent reinforcement of the conditioned response
B: Habituation to the conditioned stimulus
C: Transformation of conditioned respondent behavior
D: Emergence of a new unconditioned response
E: No change in conditioned respondent behavior
F: Increased resistance to extinction
G: Strengthening of conditioned respondent behavior
H: Spontaneous recovery of the conditioned response
I: Extinction of conditioned respondent behavior
J: Generalization of the conditioned response to more stimuli

Okay, so I have this psychology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see... It's about classical conditioning, which I remember is the type of learning discovered by Ivan Pavlov. The question is about what happens after a conditioned response has been acquired, and then the procedure changes.

Hmm, the setup is that the conditioned stimulus (CS) is repeatedly presented without the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) following it. Wait, right, in classical conditioning, the CS is something like the bell Pavlov used, and the UCS is the food that naturally causes salivation. So normally, when the CS is paired with the UCS, the CS eventually triggers a conditioned response (like salivation without the food).

Now, the question is, what happens if after this conditioning, we present the CS many times without the UCS. I think this relates to extinction. Extinction is when the conditioned response decreases because the CS isn't followed by the UCS anymore. So each time the CS is presented alone, the conditioned response gets weaker.

Let me look at the options. The options are A through J. I'll go through them one by one.

Option A: Intermittent reinforcement. Wait, reinforcement is a term from operant conditioning, not classical. So probably not this.

Option B: Habituation. Habituation is when a response decreases because the stimulus is presented repeatedly without anything else. But isn't that more of a general concept, not specific to conditioned responses? Or is it the same as extinction? I think habituation is a broader term, and extinction is a specific type of habituation in classical conditioning. So maybe B is related, but I'm not sure.

Option C: Transformation... not sure what that refers to. Doesn't ring a bell immediately.

Option D: Emergence of a new unconditioned response. That doesn't make sense because the UCS is unconditioned. If it's new, it would require a new stimulus, but the question is about changing the procedure after conditioning.

Option E: No change. That can't be right because if you stop pairing the CS with the UCS, the response should decrease.

Option F: Increased resistance to extinction. Wait, resistance to extinction is when it's harder to extinguish the response. But presenting the CS without the UCS should make the response extinguish, not make it more resistant.

Option G: Strengthening... No, because without the UCS, the response shouldn't get stronger.

Option H: Spontaneous recovery. That's when after extinction, the response comes back after a rest period. But this question is about what happens during the procedure change, not after a pause.

Option I: Extinction of conditioned response. Oh, this sounds right. Because when you present the CS without the UCS repeatedly, the conditioned response diminishes, leading to extinction.

Option J: Generalization. That's when the response occurs to similar stimuli. But the question doesn't mention other stimuli, just the CS being presented alone.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be I: Extinction of conditioned respondent behavior.

The question involves classical conditioning and asks what happens when the conditioned stimulus (CS) is repeatedly presented without the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) after a conditioned response has been acquired. This scenario describes the process of extinction, where the conditioned response diminishes over time because the CS is no longer paired with the UCS.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, F, G, H, J**: These options relate to concepts like reinforcement, resistance, strengthening, recovery, or generalization, which are not relevant to the scenario described.
- **B**: Habituation is a broader concept and not specific to classical conditioning.
- **C, D, E**: These options do not align with the extinction process.
- **I**: Extinction is the correct term for the decrease in the conditioned response when the CS is presented without the UCS.

Thus, the correct answer is:

I: Extinction of conditioned respondent behavior.
