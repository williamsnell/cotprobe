Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Mrs. Batter's earnings from the Colonial Cookie Company. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that the company pays on a piece-rate basis at 80 cents per piece. That means for each cookie or piece Mrs. Batter makes, she gets 80 cents. So, I need to find out how many pieces she made in total and then multiply that by 0.80 dollars to get her earnings.

Looking at the numbers given, Mrs. Batter worked five days last week. Each day she made a certain number of acceptable pieces. Let's list them out:

- Monday: 45 pieces
- Tuesday: 41 pieces
- Wednesday: 49 pieces
- Thursday: 47 pieces
- Friday: 43 pieces

Alright, so I need to add all these up to get the total number of pieces she made during the week. Let me do the addition one by one to make sure I don't make a mistake.

Starting with Monday: 45. Then add Tuesday's 41. So 45 + 41 equals 86. Okay, that's after two days. Next is Wednesday with 49. Adding that to 86 gives me 86 + 49. Let's see, 80 + 40 is 120, and 6 +9 is 15, so 135. So now we're at 135 after three days.

Then comes Thursday: 47 pieces. Adding that to 135. Hmm, 135 + 40 is 175, and then plus 7 is 182. So after Thursday, she's made 182 pieces. Finally, Friday is 43. Adding that to 182. Let's see, 180 + 40 is 220, and 2 +3 is 5, so 225. Wait, wait, wait a second. No, wait. Let me redo that addition to make sure.

Wait, 182 plus 43. Let me break it down differently. 182 + 40 is 222, and then add 3 more, which makes 225. Oh, so the total number of pieces she made is 225. That seems a bit high, but let me check my addition again.

Alternatively, I can add all the numbers together step by step:

45 (Monday)
+41 = 86 (Monday + Tuesday)
+49 = 135 (adding Wednesday)
+47 = 182 (adding Thursday)
+43 = 225 (adding Friday).

Yes, that's correct. So 225 pieces in total.

Now, each piece is 80 cents. So to find her total earnings, I multiply the total pieces by 0.80 dollars. Let me calculate that.

225 * 0.80. Hmm. Well, 200 * 0.8 is 160, and 25 * 0.8 is 20. So 160 +20 is 180. So that would be $180.

Wait a second, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Alternatively, I can think of 80 cents as a fraction. 80 cents is 4/5 of a dollar, right? So 225 * 4/5.

Calculating that: 225 divided by 5 is 45. 45 multiplied by 4 is 180. Yep, same result.

So her total earnings would be $180. Now, looking at the options provided, I need to find which option corresponds to $180.

Looking at the options:

A: $160

B: $195

C: $220

D: $185

E: $175

F: $200

G: $225

H: $210

I: $165

J: $180

So option J is $180. That must be the correct answer.

To determine Mrs. Batter's total earnings for the week, we first calculate the total number of acceptable pieces she completed. The number of pieces each day is as follows:

- Monday: 45  
- Tuesday: 41  
- Wednesday: 49  
- Thursday: 47  
- Friday: 43  

Adding these together:  
\[ 45 + 41 + 49 + 47 + 43 = 225 \text{ pieces} \]

The Colonial Cookie Company pays 80 cents per piece. To find the total earnings, multiply the total number of pieces by the piece rate:  
\[ 225 \times 0.80 = 180 \text{ dollars} \]

Thus, Mrs. Batter's total earnings for the week are **$180**. Comparing this result to the provided options, the correct answer is:

**J: $180**
