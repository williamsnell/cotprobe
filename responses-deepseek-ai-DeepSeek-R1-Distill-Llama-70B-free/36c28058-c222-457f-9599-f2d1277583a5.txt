Question:

Which of the following statements concerning a sarcomere of a striated muscle (such as skeletal muscle) is correct?

Options:

A: The A band shortens during muscle contraction.
B: During contraction H zones become elongated.
C: The proteins troponin and tropomyosin constitute the thick and thin filaments, respectively.
D: Myosin filaments are found in the I band.
E: Troponin and tropomyosin are located in the H zone.
F: Tropomyosin binds to myosin, blocking the actin-binding site.
G: The thin filaments are composed entirely of myosin.
H: In the relaxed position tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin.

Okay, I'm trying to tackle this question about sarcomeres in striated muscle. I remember that a sarcomere is the structural unit of striated muscle tissue, and it's important for muscle contraction. Let me think through each option step by step.

So the question is asking which statement is correct. The options are A through H, each making a different claim about the sarcomere structure or function.

First, I'll try to recall what each part of the sarcomere looks like. The sarcomere has several regions: the Z lines at each end, the I band which is the light region near the Z lines, the A band which is the dark region where the thick myosin filaments are, and the H zone in the middle of the A band, which is lighter because there's only myosin there. Then there's the M line in the center.

Now, during muscle contraction, the sarcomere shortens. I remember that the I bands and H zones change in length. The I band shortens because the actin filaments (thin) slide into the A band. The H zone also shortens because the thick myosin filaments are overlapping more with the thin filaments. So if the H zone becomes more narrow, the statement saying it becomes elongated would be wrong. So option B says H zones become elongated during contractionâ€”that's incorrect.

Option A says the A band shortens. Wait, no. The A band stays the same length because it's the length of the myosin filaments. The shortening comes from the filaments sliding past each other, so the A band doesn't change length. So A is incorrect.

Option C: Troponin and tropomyosin constitute the thick and thin filaments. Hmm. I think thick filaments are myosin, and thin are actin. Troponin and tropomyosin are part of the thin filaments. Troponin is a complex on the actin filament, and tropomyosin wraps around it. So C is incorrect because it's swapped.

Option D: Myosin filaments in the I band. No, because the I band is where the thin actin filaments are, and myosin is in the A band. So D is wrong.

Option E: Troponin and tropomyosin in the H zone. The H zone is the region in the center of the A band where only myosin is. Troponin and tropomyosin are on the actin filaments, which are in the I band and overlap with the A band. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Tropomyosin binds to myosin, blocking the actin site. Wait, I thought tropomyosin is on the actin filament. It binds along the actin and, in the relaxed state, covers the myosin binding sites on actin. So F is incorrect because it says tropomyosin binds to myosin, which is opposite. Tropomyosin is on actin, not myosin.

Option G: Thin filaments are entirely myosin. No, thin filaments are actin, plus tropomyosin and troponin. So G is wrong.

Option H: In relaxed position, tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to actin. Yes, that sounds right. When the muscle is relaxed, tropomyosin covers the binding sites on the actin filaments, preventing myosin heads from binding. So when a muscle is stimulated to contract, calcium ions bind to troponin, which moves tropomyosin away, exposing the binding sites.

So the correct answer should be option H.

To determine the correct statement about the sarcomere of a striated muscle, let's analyze each option:

- **A**: The A band shortens during muscle contraction.  
  This is incorrect because the A band, which contains the thick myosin filaments, does not change length during contraction. The shortening of the sarcomere is due to the sliding of filaments past each other.

- **B**: During contraction, H zones become elongated.  
  This is incorrect because the H zone, located in the middle of the A band, shortens during contraction as the thin actin filaments slide deeper into the A band, increasing overlap with the myosin filaments.

- **C**: The proteins troponin and tropomyosin constitute the thick and thin filaments, respectively.  
  This is incorrect because thick filaments are composed of myosin, while thin filaments are primarily composed of actin. Troponin and tropomyosin are regulatory proteins associated with the thin filaments.

- **D**: Myosin filaments are found in the I band.  
  This is incorrect because the I band contains only thin actin filaments. Myosin filaments are located in the A band.

- **E**: Troponin and tropomyosin are located in the H zone.  
  This is incorrect because the H zone is the region of the A band where only myosin filaments are present. Troponin and tropomyosin are associated with the thin actin filaments.

- **F**: Tropomyosin binds to myosin, blocking the actin-binding site.  
  This is incorrect because tropomyosin binds to actin filaments, not myosin. It blocks the myosin-binding sites on actin in the relaxed state.

- **G**: The thin filaments are composed entirely of myosin.  
  This is incorrect because thin filaments are composed of actin, along with tropomyosin and troponin.

- **H**: In the relaxed position, tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin.  
  This is correct. In the relaxed state, tropomyosin covers the myosin-binding sites on actin filaments, preventing myosin heads from binding. During contraction, calcium binding to troponin moves tropomyosin away, exposing the binding sites.

The correct answer is **H**.
