Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about GDP calculation. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned in my economics class.

The question is asking, "GDP is calculated for each by" and then gives options from A to J. Each option has a time period and an organization responsible. I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which is a measure of the total economic output of a country. Now, how often is GDP calculated? I think it's not something they do every day or every month because that would be too frequent and probably not feasible. But wait, maybe they do it quarterly? Or perhaps annually?

Wait, I recall that in the US, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is responsible for calculating GDP. So that's the organization part. Now, the time period: I think they release GDP figures quarterly. So every three months, they put out the numbers. That makes sense because collecting all the necessary data more frequently might be difficult.

Let me go through the options. Let's see:

Option A: day; Bureau of Labor Statistics. No, GDP isn't daily, and BLS does labor stuff like unemployment, not GDP.

Option B: month; BLS. Again, BLS isn't the right agency, and monthly GDP seems too frequent.

Option C: year; BLS. Agency wrong, and I think it's more frequent than annually.

Option D: month; BEA. Hmm, BEA is right, but monthly GDP? I'm not sure. I thought it's quarterly.

Option E: day; BEA. No way, too frequent.

Option F: every two months; BEA. Not sure about this. Two months isn't a standard interval I've heard of.

Option G: year; BEA. That's possible, but I think they do it more often than annually.

Option H: quarter; BEA. This rings a bell. Quarterly GDP reports, yes, I think that's correct.

Option I: week; BLS. No, weekly is too often and wrong agency.

Option J: week; BEA. Also no, same reason.

So the correct option should be H: quarter; The Bureau of Economic Analysis.

The correct answer is H: quarter; The Bureau of Economic Analysis.

GDP is calculated quarterly by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This periodicity allows for accurate data collection and analysis without being too frequent to be impractical. The BEA is the responsible agency, not the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which handles labor-related data.

Answer: H
