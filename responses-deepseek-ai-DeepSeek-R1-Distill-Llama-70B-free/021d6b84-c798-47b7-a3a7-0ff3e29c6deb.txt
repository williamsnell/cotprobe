Question:

Late one evening a man was driving home from his job as a security guard at a jewefry store. As the man approached a railroad crossing he noticed that the barriers to the crossing were open. The man cautiously looked both ways for any train. Assuming that no train was coming, he proceeded across the railroad tracks. Suddenly, an oncoming train struck the man's car, completely demolishing it. The man was dead on arrival at the local hospital. Unknown to the man, the railroad crossing guard, in a drunken stupor, had fallen asleep at the barrier controls. He failed to see or hear the signals from the oncoming train that struck and killed the man. The railroad company was well aware of the crossing guard's alcoholism, but continued to employ him. However, two weeks after the accident occurred, the railroad company fired the crossing guard. The executor of the man's estate institutes a wrongful death action against the railroad company. During the trial, the attorney for the man's estate offered into proof the fact that the defendant railroad company dismissed the crossing guard shortly after the accident. Upon objection by the railroad company's attorney, the court should

Options:

A: overrule the objection, as the employee's dismissal was an admission that the railroad company was aware of the crossing guard's chronic alcoholism.
B: sustain the objection, as the dismissal is irrelevant to the case at hand.
C: sustain the objection, as evidence of subsequent remedial repairs is inadmissible.
D: overrule the objection, as the dismissal is direct evidence of negligence.
E: overrule the objection, as an adoptive admission by conduct.
F: overrule the objection, as the dismissal is evidence of the railroad company's knowledge of the guard's incompetence.
G: sustain the objection, as the dismissal could unduly influence the jury.
H: sustain the objection, because the probative value of the evidence would be outweighed by its prejudicial effect.
I: overrule the objection, as the dismissal is circumstantial evidence of negligence.
J: sustain the objection, as the dismissal could be seen as an admission of guilt.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand the scenario.

So, there's a man who was driving home from his job as a security guard at a jewelry store. He approached a railroad crossing and saw that the barriers were open. He looked both ways for any train, didn't see one, and proceeded across. Then a train hit his car, killing him. The railroad crossing guard was asleep drunk and didn't see or hear the train. The railroad company knew about the guard's alcoholism but kept employing him. Two weeks after the accident, they fired the guard. Now, the estate's executor is suing the railroad company for wrongful death.

At the trial, the estate's attorney wants to present the fact that the railroad company fired the guard after the accident. The railroad company's attorney objects, and the court has to decide whether to overrule or sustain that objection.

The question is about evidence law, specifically what's admissible and what's not. I remember that there are rules about subsequent remedial measures. Like, if someone fixes a problem after an accident, that can't be used as evidence of negligence because it might discourage people from fixing things.

Wait, but in this case, it's not a remedial measure like fixing a fence or repainting a crosswalk. It's firing an employee. So does the same rule apply? I think the rule is under FRE 407 or something similar, which says that evidence of subsequent measures isn't admissible to prove negligence, but it can be used for other purposes, like proving ownership or control.

So if the railroad fired the guard, that's a subsequent action. The plaintiff is probably trying to use it to show that the railroad was negligent because they knew the guard was a problem and finally fired him. But is that admissible?

I think the key here is whether the dismissal is being used as a remedial measure. Firing someone could be seen as a remedial actionâ€”like fixing the problem of having an incompetent guard. So under 407, evidence of that firing isn't admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct. But maybe it's admissible for another reason, like showing that the railroad had knowledge of the guard's issues before the accident.

Wait, but the railroad's knowledge is already established because the question says they were aware of the guard's alcoholism. So the dismissal isn't necessary to prove that. The dismissal is more about their action after the fact.

So the estate's attorney is offering the dismissal as proof that the railroad was at fault. But under the rules, subsequent remedial measures are inadmissible for that purpose. So the court should sustain the objection because it's a subsequent remedial measure.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the court should sustain the objection because it's evidence of subsequent remedial repairs. But here, it's not a repair; it's a dismissal. So maybe C isn't the right reason.

Option F says overrule because dismissal is evidence of their knowledge. But their knowledge is already known, so maybe it's not necessary.

Option A suggests it's an admission of awareness. But again, the awareness is already established.

Option E says it's an adoptive admission by conduct. I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another angle: when an employer fires an employee after an incident, that could be seen as an admission that the employee was at fault, which might imply the employer's negligence. But I think the rules about subsequent measures would still apply unless it's being used for a different purpose.

So the correct reasoning is that evidence of the dismissal is a subsequent remedial measure and thus inadmissible under FRE 407. So the court should sustain the objection because it's subsequent remedial measures, making option C the correct choice.

Wait, but option C says "subsequent remedial repairs." Does firing someone fall under "repairs"? Maybe not. So perhaps the better answer is that the dismissal is irrelevant or that its probative value is outweighed by prejudice.

Alternatively, maybe the dismissal is not a remedial measure but just a personnel action. But I'm not sure. I think the key is that the rule excludes such evidence to prevent discouraging corrective actions. So the firing, as a form of corrective action, would be excluded.

So looking back at the options, option C is about remedial repairs, which doesn't exactly fit, but maybe it's the closest. Alternatively, option B says it's irrelevant, but I don't think that's right because it's relevant to show the railroad's knowledge, but it's excluded under 407.

Wait, perhaps option F is trying to say that the dismissal shows knowledge, but since knowledge is already established, it's not necessary. So the evidence is being offered for the wrong purpose.

Wait, but the question is about whether the court should overrule or sustain the objection. The railroad's attorney objects, and the court has to decide.

If the evidence is being offered to show negligence, then it's inadmissible as a subsequent remedial measure. So the objection should be sustained. So the options are C, B, G, H, J.

Option C is about remedial repairs, which isn't exactly the case here. Option B says it's irrelevant, but I think it's relevant but inadmissible under 407.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is C, because the dismissal is a subsequent remedial measure. Firing the guard is a way to remedy the problem, so it's a subsequent measure.

Alternatively, the dismissal could be seen as an admission. But I think the primary reason it's inadmissible is under 407.

So the answer should be C: sustain the objection because it's evidence of subsequent remedial repairs. But wait, the dismissal isn't a repair. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is F: overrule the objection because it shows the railroad's knowledge. But the railroad's knowledge was already established, so the dismissal isn't necessary for that. So the evidence might be excluded as cumulative, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, let me think again. The estate's attorney is trying to get in the fact that the railroad fired the guard two weeks later. The railroad objects. The issue is whether that fact is admissible.

Under FRE 407, evidence of measures taken after an event is not admissible to prove negligence or defect, but it can be used for other purposes, like proving ownership or control. So in this case, the firing could be seen as a measure taken to remedy the situation (i.e., removing a problematic employee). Therefore, it's inadmissible to show negligence, but perhaps admissible for another reason.

But the estate's attorney is trying to use it to show that the railroad was negligent in hiring or supervising, implying that they knew the guard was unfit. But since the railroad's knowledge was already established (they were aware of his alcoholism), the dismissal isn't necessary for that purpose. So perhaps it's being used to show that they took corrective action, which is barred under 407.

Thus, the court should sustain the objection because it's subsequent remedial measures. So the answer would be C.

But wait, some might argue that firing someone isn't a "remedial repair." But the term "subsequent remedial measures" can include actions like firing an incompetent employee. So I think C is the right answer.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence in a wrongful death case where the plaintiff seeks to introduce the fact that the railroad company fired the crossing guard two weeks after the accident. The key issue is whether this evidence is admissible under the rules of evidence, particularly in light of the rule regarding subsequent remedial measures.

Under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 407, evidence of subsequent remedial measures is generally inadmissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct. This rule applies because such evidence might discourage individuals or organizations from taking corrective actions. In this case, the railroad company's decision to fire the crossing guard could be viewed as a subsequent remedial measure aimed at addressing the problem of the guard's alcoholism, which led to the accident.

The plaintiff's attorney is likely offering the dismissal to imply that the railroad company acknowledged its own negligence by firing the guard. However, the railroad company's awareness of the guard's alcoholism is already established in the case. Therefore, the dismissal is not necessary to prove the company's knowledge. Moreover, the primary purpose of introducing this evidence appears to be to show negligence, which is barred under FRE 407.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C** correctly identifies that the dismissal is evidence of a subsequent remedial measure and is therefore inadmissible under FRE 407. While "remedial repairs" typically refer to physical fixes, the concept can extend to personnel actions like firing an incompetent employee to remedy a problem.
- Other options either mischaracterize the reasoning (e.g., Option B, which claims irrelevance) or fail to address the specific evidentiary rule at play.

Thus, the court should sustain the objection because the dismissal constitutes a subsequent remedial measure under FRE 407, making Option C the correct answer.

**Answer: C**
