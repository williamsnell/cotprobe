Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about corn plants and polygenes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that there are two races of corn. One averages 48 inches tall, and the other 72 inches. They cross them, and the F1 generation averages 60 inches. But when they looked at 500 F1 plants, two were 48 inches and two were 72 inches, the rest were in between. So, I need to find out how many polygenes are involved and how much each contributes.

Wait, polygenes are multiple genes that contribute to a single trait, right? Like, each gene has a small effect, and together they add up. So in this case, height is controlled by several genes.

I remember that in such cases, when you have parents differing in a polygenic trait, the F1 might show some variation. But in this problem, the F1 has plants that are 48, 72, and in between. But wait, F1 usually doesn't vary much if it's a simple cross, so maybe this isn't a simple Mendelian case.

Wait, the F1 averages 60 inches. So the F1 is 60, which is exactly halfway between 48 and 72, right? Because 48 + 72 is 120, divided by 2 is 60. So that makes me think that the F1 is a heterozygote for each gene.

But the next part is about the F2 generation, I think. Because when F1 plants are selfed or crossed, you get segregation. Oh, wait, the question says that when 500 F1 plants were classified, only two were 48 and two were 72. Wait, but F1 plants are usually all the same, unless there's something else going on.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, no. The setup is that the F1 plants are the result of crossing the two races. So the F1 would be the first generation, and they are all presumably heterozygotes. But then when they self-pollinate, the F2 would show variation. But the question says that when 500 F1 plants were classified, two were 48, two were 72, and the rest in between. Wait, that can't be right because F1 are usually all the same. Unless maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps the F1 are all 60 inches on average, but there's some variation. But how? Because F1 should be heterozygotes, and if it's polygenic, each gene would contribute a certain amount. Maybe the question is considering the range within the F2 generation, but the description is a bit confusing.

Wait, no, the question says the F1 generation doesn't vary much but when 500 were classified, two were 48, two were 72. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the question actually refers to the F2 generation. Because F1 would typically be uniform if it's a cross between two pure lines. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the F1 plants were selfed, and their seeds were planted, and the resulting plants (F2) showed this variation. Because F1 would be all the same, but F2 would show variation.

So perhaps the setup is that the parents are true breeding for the trait. One is 48 inches, the other 72 inches. They are crossed, and the F1 are all 60 inches. Then, when F1 are selfed, the F2 shows a range, with some plants at 48 and 72, and others in between.

Wait, but the question says that when 500 F1 plants were classified, two were 48 and two 72. That's confusing because F1 should all be the same. Unless the F1 are actually F2 plants.

Wait, maybe the question is worded a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the F1 are not all the same, but due to multiple genes, have some variation, but that's unusual. Normally, F1 would be uniform for polygenic traits only if all the contributing parents are homozygous for different alleles. Wait, but polygenic traits are usually quantitative, and F1 would be intermediate, but in reality, F1 for polygenic traits can show some variation, but in this case, it's stated that F1's don't vary much, averaging 60. So perhaps the two 48 and two 72 are extremes in the F2 generation, not F1.

Wait, let me read the question again.

"Two races of corn averaging 48 and 72 inches in height are crossed. The height of the F_1 generation does not vary very much, averaging 60 inches. When 500 of these plants were classified, two were 48 inches, and two were 72 inches, the rest falling between these in height. What is the number of polygenes involved, and how many inches does each contribute?"

Hmm, so the F1 plants are the ones that were classified into 500, with two at each extreme. That's strange because F1 should be uniform. Unless each F1 plant is a heterozygote for several genes, and when they self-pollinate, the F2 would have more variation. But the question is about F1, which is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the F1 plants are actually the F2 generation. Because F1 would not show much variation. Alternatively, perhaps the F1 plants are being considered as a group that includes some variation due to multiple genes.

Wait, perhaps the F1 is actually showing some phenotypic variation due to the number of polygenes involved. Let me think about how polygenic traits work.

If a trait is controlled by n polygenes, each with two alleles, then each gene contributes a certain amount to the phenotype. For example, each gene might have a dominant allele that adds a certain number of inches. So, if you have parents that are homozygous for all recessive or all dominant alleles, their F1 would be heterozygous for each gene and display an intermediate phenotype.

In this case, parent 1 is 48, parent 2 is 72. The difference is 24 inches. So the F1 is 60, which is exactly in the middle. So perhaps each gene contributes 24/(2n) inches, because each heterozygote would contribute half the difference per gene.

Wait, but if the F1 is 60, that's the average. So the total difference between the two parents is 24 inches. So that's 72-48=24.

If each gene contributes a certain amount, say 'a' per gene when homozygous, then the parent 48 would have all recessive alleles (maybe each contributing 0), and the other parent 72 would have all dominant alleles, each contributing 'a' inches. So the F1 would have each gene as heterozygote, contributing a/2 per gene.

So the total for the F1 would be (number of genes) * (a/2). And the F1's average is 60 inches. So:

F1 = (n * a/2) + 48? Wait, because the recessive parent is 48. Or perhaps the recessive is 48, and each dominant allele adds to the height.

Wait, alternative approach. Let me model the parents as being at the extremes. Let's say that each polygene has two alleles, and the dominant allele contributes a certain effect, say 'd' inches. The recessive allele contributes nothing or zero. So the two parents would be homozygous recessive (48 inches) and homozygous dominant (72 inches), assuming that each gene contributes equally.

Wait, no, because 72 is the taller. So parent A is 48, which is perhaps the recessive condition, and parent B is 72, dominant. So the F1, being heterozygous for each gene, would have a height determined by the sum of the dominant contributions.

But wait, another approach. The difference between the two parents is 72-48=24 inches. Each gene contributes a certain amount to this difference. If there are n genes, each contributes 24/n inches. But in the F1, each gene is heterozygous, so each contributes half of its effect. So F1 height would be 48 (parent A) plus n*(d/2), where d is the effect per gene.

Wait, but parent B is 72, which is 24 inches taller. So the total effect of all dominant alleles is 24 inches. So each gene contributes d inches, and there are n genes, so total d*n =24 inches.

In the F1, each gene is heterozygous, so each contributes d/2. Therefore, the F1 height would be 48 + (n*(d/2)).

But wait, 48 plus n*(d/2) equals 60 inches. So 60=48 + (n*(d/2)).

But since d*n=24, let's substitute d=24/n. So:

60=48 + (n*( (24/n)/2 )) 

Simplify inside the parentheses: (24/(n*2))=12/n.

So 60=48 + n*(12/n) → 60=48 +12 → 60=60. So that equation checks out, but it doesn't help find n.

Hmm, so perhaps I need to look at the F2 generation. Because the F1 plants, when selfed, would produce an F2 generation with more variation. The question, though, talks about 500 F1 plants, but that seems off because F1 should be uniform. Maybe it's a typo, and it's the F2 generation.

Assuming that the 500 plants are from F2, when F1 is selfed, then the variation comes from the segregation of the polygenes.

In a polygenic model with n genes, each with two alleles, the F2 generation from a self of F1 (which is n heterozygotes) would produce a range of phenotypes. The extreme phenotypes would be when all genes are homozygous recessive (48 inches) or homozygous dominant (72 inches). But in reality, those homozygous extremes would be very rare, especially as n increases.

The number of phenotypic classes in F2 depends on the number of genes. For each gene, the F2 has a 3:1 ratio, but with multiple genes, the distribution becomes more normal.

But in the problem, in 500 plants, only two were 48 inches, two were 72 inches, and the rest in between. So the extreme phenotypes are very rare.

The number of occurrences of the extreme phenotypes depends on the number of genes. For example, with n genes, the probability that all n genes are homozygous recessive is (1/4)^n. Similarly for all homozygous dominant.

Wait, the expected number of homozygous recessive individuals in F2 would be (1/4)^n * total plants. Similarly for homozygous dominant.

In this case, the observed number is 2 plants at 48 (homozygous recessive) and 2 at 72 (homozygous dominant) in 500 plants.

So, the expected number for each extreme would be approximately (1/4)^n * 500 ≈ 2. So:

(1/4)^n ≈ 2/500 → (1/4)^n ≈ 0.004.

Taking natural logs:

n * ln(1/4) = ln(0.004)

ln(1/4) is -1.3863

ln(0.004) is approximately -5.521.

So:

n = (-5.521) / (-1.3863) ≈ 4.

Wait, but let's compute this more accurately.

ln(0.004) ≈ -5.521.

So:

n ≈ 5.521 / 1.3863 ≈ 4. So n≈4.

But let's check for n=4. (1/4)^4=1/256≈0.00390625. So 500 * 0.0039 ≈ 1.95. So about 2 plants. That's close to the observed data of 2 plants at each extreme.

So n=4.

Wait, but wait. Are the two extremes each homozygous for all recessive and all dominant? So for 4 genes, each plant homozygous recessive would be 48 inches, and homozygous dominant would be 72. So in 500 plants, we'd expect approximately 500*(1/4)^4 = 500/256 ≈1.95, about 2 plants at each extreme, which matches the problem statement.

So n=4.

Now, each gene contributes how much? The total difference between the two parents is 72-48=24 inches, and there are 4 genes, each contributing 6 inches. Because 4 * 6 =24.

Wait, let's confirm. Each dominant allele contributes 6 inches. So the parent at 72 inches would have all four dominant alleles (each contributing 6 inches, 4*6=24). The other parent has none, so 0. The F1 would have two alleles for each gene (since each is heterozygous), so each contributes 3 inches (half of 6). So 4 genes *3 inches each =12 inches. 48 +12=60 inches, which matches the F1 average.

So each polygene contributes 6 inches, and there are 4 of them.

Looking at the options, option H is four polygenes, 6 inches each. So the correct answer should be option H.

To determine the number of polygenes involved and their individual contributions to the height of the corn plants, we analyze the data provided:

1. **Parental Heights**: The two races of corn have average heights of 48 inches and 72 inches, with a total difference of \( 72 - 48 = 24 \) inches.

2. **F1 Generation**: The F1 generation averages 60 inches, which is exactly halfway between the parental heights. This suggests that the F1 plants are heterozygous for all polygenes, with each gene contributing half of its effect to the phenotype.

3. **F2 Generation**: When 500 F1 plants were classified, two plants were 48 inches (homozygous recessive), and two plants were 72 inches (homozygous dominant), with the rest falling between these extremes. This indicates that the F2 generation shows segregation of the polygenes.

4. **Number of Polygenes**: The occurrence of extreme phenotypes (48 inches and 72 inches) in the F2 generation is very rare. The probability of a plant being homozygous recessive or homozygous dominant for all genes is \( (1/4)^n \), where \( n \) is the number of polygenes. Given that approximately 2 plants out of 500 correspond to each extreme, we solve:
   \[
   (1/4)^n \cdot 500 \approx 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (1/4)^n \approx 0.004
   \]
   Taking the natural logarithm:
   \[
   n \cdot \ln(1/4) = \ln(0.004) \quad \Rightarrow \quad n \approx \frac{-5.521}{-1.3863} \approx 4
   \]
   Thus, there are 4 polygenes.

5. **Contribution of Each Polygene**: The total difference between the parents is 24 inches, and with 4 polygenes, each gene contributes:
   \[
   \frac{24}{4} = 6 \, \text{inches}
   \]

6. **Verification**: In the F1 generation, each polygene contributes half of its effect, so the height of the F1 is:
   \[
   48 + 4 \cdot \frac{6}{2} = 48 + 12 = 60 \, \text{inches}
   \]
   This matches the data provided.

Therefore, the number of polygenes involved is 4, and each contributes 6 inches to the height. The correct answer is:

**H: Four polygenes, 6 inches each**
