Alright, so I have this question about norovirus and how it's studied since it can't be cultured in cell cultures. Hmm, okay, I remember that norovirus is a common cause of gastroenteritis, but it's tricky to work with in labs because it doesn't grow well in traditional cell cultures. 

The question is asking, if cell culture isn't an option, what's the best way to study it. The options are A through I. Let me think through each option.

Option A: Volunteer studies. I think this is where people are given the virus intentionally to study its effects. I remember hearing about this with norovirus—like they have studies where volunteers are exposed to see how the virus behaves, its infectivity, and so on. That could be a viable method since you can observe the actual infection process in humans.

Option B: Animal studies using non-human primates. Norovirus is known to have animal models. Non-human primates might be used because they can be infected and show similar symptoms, allowing researchers to study the virus's behavior and potential treatments. But I'm not sure if this is the best option if the virus doesn't grow in cell culture.

Option C: Computer simulation models. This sounds like using computational methods to model the virus's structure or behavior. While useful for understanding certain aspects, it might not capture the full complexity of the virus's interaction with a host.

Option D: Studying the virus's effect on plant cells. Wait, norovirus affects humans, not plants. So this doesn't make much sense. Plant cells wouldn't be a good model for studying a human virus.

Option E: Cells using replicon systems. Replicons are like parts of the virus's genome that can replicate without the whole virus. So if the full virus can't be cultured, maybe using a replicon system in cells allows study of replication mechanisms. I've heard of this being used for other viruses, like hepatitis C, where they use replicon systems in cell culture.

Option F: Animal models. This is broader than option B, including any animals. I'm not sure which specific model is best, but using animals could help study the virus's lifecycle and immune response.

Option G: Isolating the virus in a lab. But if it can't be cultured in cell culture, isolating it might be difficult. So this might not be feasible.

Option H: Cells using non-replicon systems. Not sure what this refers to. Maybe systems that don't replicate, which doesn't help if replication is what you're studying.

Option I: Deductions from the 3 human ORFs. ORFs are open reading frames in the genome. By studying the genetic material, you can infer functions, but this is more about the genetic code rather than the virus's behavior in a host.

So, putting it all together. Since cell culture isn't possible, alternatives are needed. Volunteer studies (A) let you study the virus in real humans, which is great but maybe not the most controlled or practical method. Animal models (B or F) could work but depend on how well the animal model mimics human infection. Replicon systems (E) allow studying the virus's replication in a controlled cell environment without culturing the whole virus.

Wait, the question is about the best way. I've heard that replicon systems are a common approach for studying viruses that can't be cultured. For example, norovirus replicons have been used to study replication and test antiviral drugs. So option E could be the right answer.

But I also remember that volunteer studies have been conducted for norovirus. So which is better? The question is about the best method. If replicon systems allow for controlled study without needing live virus, that's efficient. But if you need to study the virus in a human context, volunteer studies are better.

Alternatively, maybe the best is a combination, but the question asks for the best method. I'm a bit torn between E and A.

Looking back, the question says the virus can't be cultured in cell cultures. So if they can't culture it, they might use replicon systems which don't require the whole virus. So E might be the best option.

But another thought—volunteer studies are definitely a way to study the virus in humans, which is the most accurate model. But it's probably more ethically challenging and less practical for frequent studies. So perhaps replicon systems are the best alternative.

Wait, another point: if you can't culture the virus, you can't do traditional cell culture experiments. So using a replicon system allows you to study replication in cells without having the virus itself. So E would be a good method.

So, considering all that, the best answer is E: In cells using replicon systems.

If the human norovirus cannot be cultured in cell cultures, the best way to study it would be through the use of replicon systems. These systems allow researchers to study specific aspects of the virus, such as replication mechanisms, without requiring the entire virus to be cultured. While other methods like volunteer studies (A) or animal models (B, F) have their merits, replicon systems provide a controlled and efficient way to investigate the virus in a laboratory setting.
