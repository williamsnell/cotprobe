Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spherical light bulb and a steel ball bearing. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on optics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup is a spherical light bulb that's 2 inches in diameter. It's being imaged by a steel ball bearing. The ball bearing is 1 inch in diameter and is located 20 inches away from the bulb. I need to find where the image is and its diameter.

Wait, so the steel ball is acting like a mirror here. Since it's spherical, it's a spherical mirror. I remember that spherical mirrors can be concave or convex. But in this case, the ball bearing is probably acting as a convex mirror because it's a sphere. Or wait, no, wait. Actually, when you look at a spherical object like a ball, the part facing you acts like a convex mirror if it's the outside. Because the reflecting surface is curved outward. So yeah, the steel ball bearing is a convex mirror.

So the light bulb is the object, and the ball bearing is the mirror. The mirror is 1 inch in diameter, so its radius is 0.5 inches. The object is 2 inches in diameter, so radius is 1 inch. The distance between the object and the mirror is 20 inches.

Wait, wait. I think for mirrors, the formulas are based on the object distance (u) from the mirror. So here, the object is 20 inches away from the mirror. So u = 20 inches. But wait, in mirror formulas, u is usually the distance from the object to the mirror, and for real objects, u is positive. Wait, no, wait: the sign conventions can be tricky. So in optics, usually for mirrors:

- The object distance is positive if the object is in front of the mirror (real object).
- The image distance is positive if the image is real (in front of the mirror) and negative if virtual (behind the mirror).
- The focal length is positive for concave mirrors and negative for convex mirrors.

Oh wait, right. So convex mirrors have negative focal lengths.

So focal length f for a convex mirror is negative. For a spherical mirror, the focal length is R/2, where R is the radius of curvature. The radius of curvature is twice the focal length, so R = 2f.

Wait, the ball bearing is 1 inch in diameter, so radius is 0.5 inches. So R is 0.5 inches. Wait no, wait. No, wait: the radius of curvature for a spherical mirror is the radius of the sphere. So a ball bearing of diameter 1 inch has radius 0.5 inches, so the radius of curvature R is 0.5 inches. So the focal length f is R/2, which is 0.25 inches. But since it's convex, f is negative. So f = -0.25 inches.

Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Wait, that can't be right. Because the radius of curvature is the distance from the mirror to the center of the sphere. So for a convex mirror, the radius is behind the mirror. So the focal length is negative. So for a convex mirror, f = -R/2. So R here is 0.5 inches, so f = -0.25 inches. Yes, that's correct.

So now, the object is placed 20 inches in front of the mirror. So u = +20 inches.

We can use the mirror formula: 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

Plugging in the numbers:

1/(-0.25) = 1/20 + 1/v.

Calculating each term:

1/(-0.25) is -4.

So:

-4 = 0.05 + 1/v.

Wait, 1/20 is 0.05. So:

-4 = 0.05 + (1/v)

Subtract 0.05 from both sides:

-4.05 = 1/v.

So v = 1 / (-4.05) ≈ -0.2469 inches.

Wait, so v is approximately -0.25 inches. So the image is located 0.25 inches behind the mirror. Because the image distance is negative, which means it's a virtual image behind the mirror.

Wait, but the question is about where the image is. So the image is located 0.25 inches beneath the surface of the ball bearing, since it's behind.

Now, what about the size of the image? The magnification m is given by m = -v/u.

So m = - (v) / u.

v is approx -0.2469, so:

m = - ( -0.2469 ) / 20 = 0.2469 / 20 ≈ 0.01235.

Wait, that's a magnification of about 0.01235, which is about 1/80. So the image is much smaller than the object.

The object's diameter is 2 inches, so the image diameter would be m times that.

So 2 inches * 0.01235 ≈ 0.0247 inches. Hmm, approximately 0.025 inches.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, mirror formula:

1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

f = -0.25, u = 20.

So 1/(-0.25) = 1/20 + 1/v.

1/(-0.25) is -4.

So -4 = 0.05 + (1/v).

Subtract 0.05: -4.05 = 1/v => v = -1/4.05 ≈ -0.2469 in.

So yes, image distance is about -0.2469 inches. So the image is 0.2469 inches behind the mirror. Rounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 0.25 inches beneath the surface.

Magnification m = -v/u = -( -0.2469 ) / 20 = 0.2469/20 ≈ 0.01235.

So image height h' = m * h, where h is object height. So h is 2 inches (diameter), so 2 * 0.01235 ≈ 0.0247 inches, which is about 0.025 inches.

Looking at the options:

Option J: 0.025 inches in diameter, at 0.25 inches beneath the surface.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option J says 0.025 inches, and 0.25 inches beneath.

Option I: 0.05 inches, 0.49 beneath.

Option E: 0.05, 1 inch beneath.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate more accurately.

Let me compute 1/v = 1/f - 1/u.

Wait wait, wait, the mirror formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

So 1/v = 1/f - 1/u.

Wait, let me write it step by step.

f = -0.25 inches.

u = 20 inches.

1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

So 1/v = 1/f - 1/u.

Plugging in:

1/v = (1/(-0.25)) - (1/20) = (-4) - (0.05) = -4.05.

So v = 1 / (-4.05) ≈ -0.2469 inches.

So more accurately, 0.2469 inches behind the mirror.

So approximately 0.25 inches beneath.

As for the magnification, m = -v/u = - (-0.2469)/20 = 0.2469/20 ≈ 0.012345.

So image height is 2 inches * 0.012345 ≈ 0.02469 inches, so approximately 0.025 inches.

Looking at the options:

Option J: 0.025 inches diameter, located 0.25 inches beneath.

So that matches.

Wait, but let me make sure. Are there any options that match 0.025 and 0.25? Let's see the options again.

Option J: 0.025 inches, 0.25 in. beneath.

Yes, that's option J.

To solve the problem, we analyze the setup where a spherical light bulb (diameter = 2 inches) is imaged by a steel ball bearing (diameter = 1 inch) located 20 inches away. The ball bearing acts as a convex mirror because its reflecting surface is curved outward. For a convex mirror, the focal length \( f \) is negative and given by \( f = -R/2 \), where \( R \) is the radius of curvature. Since the ball bearing has a diameter of 1 inch, its radius is \( R = 0.5 \, \text{inches} \), so \( f = -0.25 \, \text{inches} \).

The object distance \( u \) is 20 inches (the distance between the light bulb and the mirror). Using the mirror formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v},
\]

we solve for the image distance \( v \). Substituting \( f = -0.25 \, \text{inches} \) and \( u = 20 \, \text{inches} \):

\[
\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{-0.25} - \frac{1}{20} = -4 - 0.05 = -4.05.
\]

Thus, \( v = \frac{1}{-4.05} \approx -0.2469 \, \text{inches} \). The negative sign indicates that the image is virtual and located behind the mirror. The image is approximately \( 0.25 \, \text{inches} \) beneath the surface of the ball bearing.

Next, we calculate the magnification \( m \) using:

\[
m = -\frac{v}{u}.
\]

Substituting \( v \approx -0.2469 \, \text{inches} \) and \( u = 20 \, \text{inches} \):

\[
m = -\frac{-0.2469}{20} = \frac{0.2469}{20} \approx 0.01235.
\]

The magnification is approximately \( 0.01235 \), meaning the image is much smaller than the object. The diameter of the light bulb is 2 inches, so the image diameter is:

\[
\text{Image diameter} = m \times \text{Object diameter} = 0.01235 \times 2 \approx 0.0247 \, \text{inches}.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the image diameter is approximately \( 0.025 \, \text{inches} \).

Finally, comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**J: 0.025 inches in diameter, located at a distance of 0.25 inches beneath the surface of the ball bearing.**
