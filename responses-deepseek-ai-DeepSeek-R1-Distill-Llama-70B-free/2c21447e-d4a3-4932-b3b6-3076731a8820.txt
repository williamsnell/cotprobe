Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about ratios and proportions. Hmm, I remember that a proportion is when two ratios are equal. So, I need to find which pair of ratios can form a proportion, meaning they're equivalent.

The question gives me option pairs from A to H. Each option has two ratios. I need to check each option to see if the two ratios are equal.

Let me think about how to check if two ratios are equal. I can do this by converting each ratio into a fraction and then seeing if the fractions are equivalent, which means they have the same value when simplified.

Starting with option A: 2 over 5 and 4 over 25. So 2/5 is 0.4. 4 divided by 25 is 0.16. Wait, that's not the same. So A isn't a proportion.

Option B: 2/5 and 5/10. 2/5 is 0.4. 5/10 simplifies to 1/2, which is 0.5. Not equal. So B isn't correct.

Option C: 2/5 and 10/15. 10/15 simplifies to 2/3, which is about 0.666. 2/5 is 0.4. Not the same, so C is out.

Option D: 2/5 and 10/20. 10/20 is 1/2 or 0.5. Still not equal to 0.4. So D doesn't work.

Option E: 2/5 and 3/8. Let me calculate those. 2/5 is 0.4, 3/8 is 0.375. Not equal. E isn't the right choice.

Option F: 2/5 and 7/14. 7/14 simplifies to 1/2, which is 0.5. Doesn't match 0.4. So F is wrong.

Option G: 2/5 and 6/15. 6/15 reduces to 2/5. Oh wait, that's the same as the first ratio. So 2/5 equals 2/5. That means this pair can form a proportion. So G looks correct.

Wait, let me check the others just to be sure. Option H: 2/5 and 8/10. 8/10 is 4/5, which is 0.8. Not the same as 0.4. So H isn't it.

So the correct answer should be option G.

To determine which pair of ratios can form a proportion, we need to check if the two ratios in each option are equal. This can be done by converting each ratio into a fraction and simplifying to see if they have the same value.

- **Option A**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) and \( \frac{4}{25} \).  
  \( \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \) and \( \frac{4}{25} = 0.16 \). Not equal.

- **Option B**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) and \( \frac{5}{10} \).  
  \( \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \) and \( \frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \). Not equal.

- **Option C**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) and \( \frac{10}{15} \).  
  \( \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \) and \( \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.666 \). Not equal.

- **Option D**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) and \( \frac{10}{20} \).  
  \( \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \) and \( \frac{10}{20} = 0.5 \). Not equal.

- **Option E**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) and \( \frac{3}{8} \).  
  \( \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \) and \( \frac{3}{8} = 0.375 \). Not equal.

- **Option F**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) and \( \frac{7}{14} \).  
  \( \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \) and \( \frac{7}{14} = 0.5 \). Not equal.

- **Option G**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) and \( \frac{6}{15} \).  
  \( \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \) and \( \frac{6}{15} = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \). Equal.

- **Option H**: \( \frac{2}{5} \) and \( \frac{8}{10} \).  
  \( \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \) and \( \frac{8}{10} = 0.8 \). Not equal.

The correct answer is **Option G**, as \( \frac{2}{5} \) and \( \frac{6}{15} \) are equal.
