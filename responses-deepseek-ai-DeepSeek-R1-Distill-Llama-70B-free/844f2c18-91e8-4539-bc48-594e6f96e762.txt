Question:

Mr.Caponiis a butcher who recently raised the price of steak at his market from $1.50 to $2.00 a pound. Correspondingly, his sales dropped from 200 pounds per day to 100 pounds per day. Is the demand for steak?

Options:

A: The demand for steak is constant
B: The demand for steak is elastic
C: The demand for steak is indirectly proportional to price
D: The demand for steak is not affected by price
E: The demand for steak is perfectly elastic
F: The demand for steak is perfectly inelastic
G: The demand for steak is inelastic
H: The demand for steak is determined by the quality
I: The demand for steak is dependent on consumer income levels
J: The demand for steak fluctuates seasonally

Okay, so I've got this economics question here about Mr. Caponi, who's a butcher. He raised the price of steak from $1.50 to $2.00 a pound. After that, his sales dropped from 200 pounds per day to 100 pounds. The question is asking about the elasticity of demand for steak.

Hmm, I remember that elasticity of demand measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. The formula I think is percentage change in quantity demanded divided by percentage change in price. If the result is greater than 1, demand is elastic. If it's less than 1, it's inelastic. Exactly 1 is unitary elastic.

So, let me calculate the percentage changes. The price went from $1.50 to $2.00. The change is $0.50, which is an increase. So the percentage change in price is (0.50 / 1.50) * 100. Let's see, 0.5 divided by 1.5 is 1/3, which is about 33.33% increase.

On the quantity side, sales dropped from 200 to 100 pounds. So the change is a decrease of 100 pounds. The percentage change is (100 / 200) * 100, which is 50% decrease.

Now, plug these into the elasticity formula. The percentage change in quantity is 50, and price is 33.33. So 50 divided by 33.33 is approximately 1.5. Since 1.5 is greater than 1, the demand is elastic. So the correct answer should be that the demand is elastic.

Looking at the options, option B says the demand is elastic. Option G says inelastic, which would be if the result was less than 1. So option B is the right choice here.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Elastic demand means that a small change in price leads to a large change in quantity. Here, a 33% price increase caused a 50% drop in sales. So yes, the quantity demanded is quite responsive. So definitely elastic. So the answer is B.

To determine the elasticity of demand for steak, we calculate the price elasticity of demand using the formula:

\[
\text{Price Elasticity of Demand} = \frac{\text{Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\text{Percentage Change in Price}}
\]

1. **Percentage Change in Price**: The price increased from $1.50 to $2.00, a change of $0.50.  
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change in Price} = \frac{0.50}{1.50} \times 100 = 33.33\%
   \]

2. **Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded**: Sales dropped from 200 pounds to 100 pounds, a change of 100 pounds.  
   \[
   \text{Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded} = \frac{100}{200} \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

3. **Elasticity Calculation**:  
   \[
   \text{Price Elasticity of Demand} = \frac{50}{33.33} \approx 1.5
   \]

Since the elasticity value (1.5) is greater than 1, the demand for steak is **elastic**. This means that the quantity demanded responds significantly to changes in price.

From the options provided:
- **Option B**: "The demand for steak is elastic" is correct.  
- Other options, such as **G** (inelastic), do not align with the calculated elasticity value.

Answer: B
