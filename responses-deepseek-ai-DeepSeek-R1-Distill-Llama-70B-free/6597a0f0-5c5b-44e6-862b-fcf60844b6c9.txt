Okay, I'm trying to figure out how Carl Rogers would explain the parents' reaction to Peter becoming an artist. So, the scenario is that all the male family members have been doctors for generations, and Peter decides to become an artist instead. His parents love him but are upset. 

I remember that Carl Rogers is a humanistic psychologist who focused on the concept of self and how people's self-concepts can influence their behavior and emotions. His person-centered approach emphasizes the importance of congruence between the self and experiences.

So, the parents are upset even though they love Peter. That seems like an internal conflict. Rogers might say that this happens because Peter's choice is conflicting with their self-structure. The self-structure includes all the perceptions and beliefs a person has about themselves. In this case, maybe the parents have a strong belief that being a doctor is part of their family identity, especially for male members. 

If their self-concept is tied to the idea that their son should follow the family tradition of being a doctor, Peter choosing a different path would threaten that. This threat would cause incongruence between their self-image and the reality of Peter's choice. That incongruence leads to feelings like distress or upset because their self-structure is being challenged.

Looking at the options, option B says exactly that: the parents' self-structure includes the notion that being a doctor is necessary for a male family member's value. Peter's choice is incongruent with their love, causing distress. That fits with Rogers' theory about how incongruence leads to psychological distress.

Other options don't directly tie into Rogers' self-concept theory. For example, option A is about family legacy, which is part of it, but it doesn't explain the psychological mechanism. Option C talks about respectable professions, which is more of a societal judgment rather than internal self-structure. Option D mentions family values, again more about the content rather than the psychological conflict. The other options (E, F, G, etc.) focus on different aspects like talent, social stigma, financial stability, reputation, or phases, which aren't directly related to Rogers' explanation.

So, the best answer is B because it directly references the threat to the parents' self-structure, which is a key concept in Rogers' theory.

The correct answer is based on Carl Rogers' theory of self-concept and incongruence. Peter's parents are upset because his choice to become an artist threatens their self-structure, which includes the belief that male family members must be doctors. This incongruence causes psychological distress.

Answer: B
