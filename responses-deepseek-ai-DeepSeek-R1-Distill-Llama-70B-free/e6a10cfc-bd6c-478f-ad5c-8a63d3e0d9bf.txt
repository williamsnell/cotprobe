Okay, so I've got this genetics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about X-linked dominant inheritance. Hmm, I remember that X-linked disorders are related to genes on the X chromosome. But wait, what's the difference between dominant and recessive in this context?

Alright, so let's start by recalling some basics. In X-linked recessive diseases, males are more often affected because they have only one X chromosome. Females would need both copies (one from each parent) to show the condition. But this question is about dominant, so it's a bit different.

In X-linked dominant disorders, if a male has the defective gene, he will definitely have the condition because he only has one X. Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, so they could be carriers or affected depending on whether they have one or two defective X's.

Wait, so how does the transmission work? Let's think. For an X-linked dominant trait, females can pass the defective gene to their offspring. Since males get their X from their mother, if the mother has the defective gene on one of her X's, she can pass it to her sons. So sons of an affected mother have a 50% chance of getting the X with the defect, assuming the mother is heterozygous (has one defective and one normal X).

But what about father to son transmission? Oh wait, fathers can't pass X-linked traits to their sons because fathers give their sons a Y chromosome, not an X. So sons can't get X-linked anything from their dad. So for X-linked dominant, a father can't pass it to his son because he gives the Y. But he can pass his X to his daughter. So if the father has the defective X, then all his daughters will get it because they get his X and the mother's X. But wait, if the father has an X-linked dominant disorder, he would have the condition, right? Because he only has one X.

So thinking about the options, the question is which is a feature. The options are from A to J.

The question is, which is a feature of X-linked dominant. So let's go through the options.

Option A: Transmitted by females only to males. Well, females can transmit to both sons and daughters. Because they pass X chromosomes. So A is not correct because it says only to males.

Option B: Transmitted by males only to females. Hmm, wait. Males have one X and one Y. They pass X to daughters and Y to sons. So if a male has an X-linked dominant condition, he can only pass his X (with the condition) to his daughters. So B says transmitted by males only to females. That would be true because males can't pass X to sons, only to daughters. So in X-linked dominant, affected fathers would pass the defective X to all their daughters, making them affected. So B seems like a possible correct answer.

Option C: Female to female transmission. X-linked dominant allows for female to female, but also female to male. So C isn't a defining feature because it's possible for transmission beyond just female to female.

Option D: No male to male or female to female transmission. Wait, X-linked dominant can have female to female transmission. So D is incorrect because that's possible.

Option E: Male to male transmission. No, because males pass Y to sons, so E is incorrect.

Option F: Parental consanguinity. That refers to parents being related, which isn't specific to X-linked dominant, so F is out.

Option G: Male to female, but not female to male. No, because females can pass X to sons, so a mother could pass to her son, making G incorrect.

Option H: Transmission only by males. No, because females can also transmit, like mother to child.

Option I: Both parents must carry the gene. No, because in dominant, only one parent needs to carry it. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Transmission only by females. No, because males can transmit too, to daughters.

Wait, but let me think again. For X-linked dominant, the key points are:

- Affected males will pass the X to all their daughters (since they give X to daughters), but not to sons (they give Y).

- Affected females have a 50% chance of passing the X to each child. Sons and daughters each have a 50% chance.

So the feature of X-linked dominant is that males can only pass the trait to their daughters, not sons.

Looking back at the options, option B says transmitted by males only to females, which aligns with that. So B is a feature.

Another option to consider is C: female to female transmission. That's possible, but not a defining feature because transmission can also be to males.

Wait, the question is which is a feature, not which is exclusive. So multiple options might be features, but the question is which is correct.

So the correct answer is B: transmitted by males only to females.

X-linked dominant inheritance involves genes located on the X chromosome, where a single copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the condition. Males, having only one X chromosome, will always express the condition if they inherit the defective gene. Females, with two X chromosomes, may be affected if they inherit one defective X chromosome (heterozygous) or two defective X chromosomes (homozygous). 

In terms of transmission:

- **Males** can only pass their X chromosome to their daughters, as they pass the Y chromosome to their sons. Therefore, males with an X-linked dominant condition will transmit the defective gene to all their daughters but not to their sons.
- **Females** can pass the defective gene to both sons and daughters, with each child having a 50% chance of inheriting the defective X chromosome.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Females can transmit the defective gene to both males and females, not just males.
- **B**: Correct. Males can only transmit their X chromosome (and thus the defective gene) to their daughters, making this a defining feature of X-linked dominant inheritance.
- **C**: Incorrect. While female-to-female transmission is possible, it is not a defining feature because females can also transmit the defective gene to males.
- **D**: Incorrect. Female-to-female transmission is possible in X-linked dominant inheritance.
- **E**: Incorrect. Male-to-male transmission is not possible because males pass the Y chromosome to their sons, not the X chromosome.
- **F**: Incorrect. Parental consanguinity is not specific to X-linked dominant inheritance.
- **G**: Incorrect. Females can transmit the defective gene to males, so this is not accurate.
- **H**: Incorrect. Transmission is not limited to males; females can also transmit the defective gene.
- **I**: Incorrect. Both parents do not need to carry the gene for X-linked dominant inheritance, as it is a dominant condition.
- **J**: Incorrect. Transmission is not limited to females; males can also transmit the defective gene to their daughters.

The correct answer is **B**, as it accurately describes a key feature of X-linked dominant inheritance: males transmit the defective gene only to their daughters.
