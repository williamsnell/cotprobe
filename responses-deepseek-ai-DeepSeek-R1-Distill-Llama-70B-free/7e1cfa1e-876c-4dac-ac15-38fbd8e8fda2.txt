Okay, so I've got this basketball team problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The team has 12 players in total. Out of these, 5 are guards and 7 are forwards. The question is asking how many different starting lineups can be formed that include 3 guards and 2 forwards.

Hmm, right. So I think this is a combinatorics problem. Combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, right? Like selecting players for a team. So I need to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 guards out of 5 and 2 forwards out of 7, and then combine those two numbers.

Wait, how do combinations work again? The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!)). So for the guards, it's 5 choose 3, and for the forwards, 7 choose 2.

Let me compute each part separately. 

First, 5 choose 3. So plugging into the formula: 5!/(3! * (5-3)! ) = (5*4*3! )/(3! * 2! ) = (5*4)/(2!) = 20/2 =10. So there are 10 ways to choose the guards.

Next, 7 choose 2. So 7!/(2! (7-2)! ) = (7*6 *5! )/(2! *5! ) = (7*6)/2 =42/2=21. So 21 ways for the forwards.

Now, since these two choices are independent, I need to multiply them to get the total number of possible lineups. So 10 * 21 equals 210.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

5 choose 3: 5*4*3/(3*2*1) = 60/6=10. Yep, that's correct.

7 choose 2: 7*6/(2*1)=42/2=21. That's right too.

So 10 times 21 is 210. Looking at the options, option C is 210. So the answer should be C.

To determine the number of different starting lineups that include 3 guards and 2 forwards, we use combinations. The formula for combinations is:

\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

1. **Choosing 3 guards out of 5**:
   \[
   \binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3!}{3! \times 2!} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

2. **Choosing 2 forwards out of 7**:
   \[
   \binom{7}{2} = \frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5!}{2! \times 5!} = \frac{42}{2} = 21
   \]

3. **Total number of lineups**:
   Multiply the two results since the choices are independent:
   \[
   10 \times 21 = 210
   \]

Thus, the total number of different starting lineups is **210**, which corresponds to option **C**.
