Question:

A company contracted with a builder to construct a new corporate headquarters for a fixed price of $100 million. At the time of the contract, structural steel was widely available and was included in the contract as a $6 million item. Before work began on the project, tornado damage shut down the production facility of the biggest structural steel supplier in the country, and the price of structural steel increased by 20% as a result. The builder informed the company of the steel price increase, and the parties then orally agreed to increase the project price to $101 million. The builder proceeded with construction and delivered the project on time. The company paid the builder $100 million but refused to pay the additional $1 million. If the builder sues the company for $1 million, is the builder likely to prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the price change of structural steel was not significant enough to warrant a contract modification.
B: No, because there was no consideration for the modification of the contract.
C: No, because the modification was never reduced to a writing signed by the party to be charged.
D: No, because the company did not sign a new contract reflecting the price change.
E: Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel.
F: Yes, because the builder completed the project on time despite the unforeseen circumstances.
G: Yes, because the builder had no control over the price increase of structural steel.
H: Yes, because the companyÕs promise was supported by consideration.
I: Yes, because the company was aware of the price increase and verbally agreed to it.
J: No, because the builder should have anticipated potential price fluctuations in materials.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's start by breaking down the facts.

The company hired a builder to construct their headquarters for a fixed price of $100 million. Structural steel was part of the contract and was priced at $6 million. But before any work started, there was a tornado that damaged the biggest steel supplier, causing the price of steel to go up by 20%. So the steel that was $6 million would now cost $7.2 million. The builder told the company about this, and they orally agreed to increase the project price by $1 million, making it $101 million. The builder did the work on time, but the company only paid $100 million and refuses to pay the extra million. Now the builder is suing for that $1 million.

So the question is whether the builder will prevail. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that contract modifications usually require consideration to be enforceable. The original contract was for $100 million. If they agree to modify it, each party needs to give something extra—consideration. So if the builder is just agreeing to do what they were already supposed to do, that's not enough. But here, the price of steel went up, which increased the builder's costs. So the modification here is the company agreeing to pay an extra $1 million because the builder's cost increased due to unforeseen circumstances.

Wait, but in the original contract, the price was fixed. So the builder took the risk of cost increases. Unless the contract had a clause allowing for price adjustments, the builder might be stuck. But the question doesn't mention such a clause, so I assume it's a standard fixed-price contract.

So when the steel price went up, the builder asked for more money. They orally agreed. So the issue is whether that oral agreement is enforceable. Also, whether there's consideration for the modification.

In general, for a contract modification, both parties need to exchange something. So if the company agrees to pay more, and the builder does the same work, is that enough? Or is the builder just doing what they were already contracted to do, so there's no new consideration from them.

Wait, but under the pre-existing duty rule, a promise to do what you're already required to do isn't sufficient consideration. So if the modification is just the builder agreeing to perform as before, and the company paying more, that might not be enough. Because the company's promise to pay more isn't supported by new consideration.

But wait, in this case, the modification was that the company would pay an extra $1 million, and in exchange, the builder would perform the same work. But the builder was already obligated to perform. So the company's additional payment wouldn't have consideration. Unless there's some other factor.

However, I've heard about the concept of "unanticipated circumstances" and how that might affect consideration. Like, if there's a change in circumstances that makes the original contract unfair, the court might allow the modification without additional consideration. Or perhaps under the doctrine of prevention or something else.

Another angle is whether this falls under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which might have different rules for contract modifications. But since this is a construction contract, I'm not sure if it's a goods contract under UCC Article 2 or a services contract under common law. Construction contracts are usually considered service contracts, so maybe UCC doesn't apply here. Without UCC, the traditional consideration rules apply.

So if it's under common law, the modification needs consideration. Here, the company agreed to pay more, but the builder didn't agree to do anything extra. So no consideration. Therefore, the modification wouldn't be enforceable, and the company doesn't have to pay the extra $1 million.

Looking at the options, option B says no because there's no consideration. Option C says no because it wasn't written. The original contract was in writing, but the modification was oral. However, the Statute of Frauds generally requires contracts for services that can't be completed in a year to be in writing, but this project might take longer than a year. Wait, the contract was to build a headquarters, which probably takes more than a year. So the original contract is covered by the Statute of Frauds and needs to be written. But the modification here is an oral agreement. So is the modification enforceable?

Wait, the original contract is in writing, but the modification is oral. The Statute of Frauds requires that any modification to a contract that's within the Statute of Frauds also needs to be in writing. So if the original contract is for a price of $100 million, and the modification is for an additional $1 million, does that put it within the Statute of Frauds? Or is the modification a separate contract?

Alternatively, the modification could be considered a new contract. But if the original was for a fixed price and this is an increase, then perhaps the modification would need to be in writing. So option C says the modification wasn't in writing, so it's not enforceable. But wait, some jurisdictions have exceptions, like when the modification is fully performed. Here, the builder performed the work and the company paid $100 million. But the builder is suing for the extra $1 million. So perhaps the oral agreement is enforceable because it's been partly performed. But I'm not sure if partial performance takes it out of the Statute of Frauds.

But the main issue here is consideration. If there's no consideration, the modification isn't valid even if it's oral. So between options B and C.

Option B says no because no consideration. Option C says no because not in writing.

In this case, the lack of consideration seems like a stronger reason. Because even if it's oral, if there's no consideration, it's not enforceable. But if there's consideration, the oral agreement might still be valid unless the Statute of Frauds applies.

Wait, the original contract was for $100 million, and the modification is an increase of $1 million. So the total becomes $101 million. If the original contract was covered by the Statute of Frauds because it couldn't be completed in a year, then the modification (adding $1 million to the price) would also need to be in writing. So the oral modification would not be enforceable under the Statute of Frauds.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Under common law, a modification without consideration is not enforceable. So even if the parties agreed orally, without something extra, the company can't be forced to pay the extra.

So in this case, the builder is trying to get an extra $1 million because their cost went up, but they're not offering anything beyond what they were already required to do. So the company's promise to pay more isn't supported by consideration.

So the answer should be B: No, because there was no consideration for the modification.

Looking at the options, option B is that.

Wait, but is there any exception when there's an unanticipated increase in costs? Like a mutual mistake or impracticability? But here, the contract was fixed, so the risk was on the builder. The increase in steel price is the builder's problem unless the contract allows for adjustments.

Alternatively, perhaps the doctrine of unanticipated circumstances applies, making the contract unfair, and allowing a modification without consideration. But I'm not sure if that's a recognized doctrine in standard contract law.

I think the key here is that without consideration, the modification isn't valid. So the company doesn't have to pay the extra million. So the answer would be B.

The question revolves around whether the builder can recover the additional $1 million for the project due to a 20% increase in the price of structural steel. The key issue is the enforceability of the oral modification to the original contract. 

Under common law, a contract modification requires consideration to be enforceable. The original contract was for $100 million, and the builder was obligated to perform as agreed. The oral modification increased the price to $101 million, but the builder did not agree to perform any additional work beyond what was already required under the original contract. Therefore, there was no new consideration from the builder to support the company's promise to pay an extra $1 million. The pre-existing duty rule dictates that a promise to perform what one is already obligated to do is not sufficient consideration.

While the price increase of structural steel due to unforeseen circumstances might seem relevant, the builder bore the risk of cost increases under the fixed-price contract unless the contract explicitly allowed for adjustments. There is no indication of such a clause in the original agreement. Thus, the modification lacks the necessary consideration to be enforceable.

Option B correctly identifies that the absence of consideration for the modification is the primary reason the builder cannot prevail. Other options, such as the need for a written agreement (Option C), are less central because the fundamental issue is the lack of consideration.
