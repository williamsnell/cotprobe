Okay, so I've got this equation here: 14 equals w plus 23. Hmm, I need to solve for w. Alright, let's think about how to do this.

Wait, the equation is 14 = w + 23. So I guess I need to isolate w. Right, because in equations, we usually try to get the variable by itself on one side.

So, if I subtract 23 from both sides, that should help. Let me write that down. If I take 14 minus 23, that should be equal to w plus 23 minus 23, which simplifies to w.

Wait, 14 minus 23... That's a negative number. Let me calculate that. 23 minus 14 is 9, so 14 minus 23 would be -9. So w equals -9.

Let me check the options. The options are A through I. Let's see: A is 9, B is 37, C is -23, D is 14, E is -14, F is 0, G is -9, H is -37, I is 23.

Oh, so G is -9, which matches what I got. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I subtract, I can get mixed up with the signs. Let me do it again.

Starting with 14 = w + 23. To get w alone, subtract 23 from both sides. So 14 - 23 equals w. 14 minus 23 is definitely -9. Yeah, that's right.

So I'm confident that the correct answer is G.

The equation to solve is \(14 = w + 23\). To isolate \(w\), subtract 23 from both sides:

\[
14 - 23 = w
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
w = -9
\]

From the given options, the correct choice is **G: -9**.
