Okay, so I've got this problem here about Reeves Corporation paying dividends. Hmm, I need to find the dividends per share for both the preferred and common stock. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, first, the problem says the total dividend is $50,000. I remember that dividends are usually paid first to preferred stockholders before any are given to common stockholders. So I think I should calculate the preferred dividend first and then see what's left for the common.

Reeves has 1,000 shares of 6%, $50 par value preferred stock. Oh right, the dividend for preferred is calculated as (par value) multiplied by the dividend rate. So that's 50 * 6% for each share. Let me compute that: 50 * 0.06 = 3 dollars per share. So each preferred share gets $3.

Now, with 1,000 shares, the total preferred dividend would be 1,000 * 3 = $3,000. Wait, but wait, sometimes I've heard that sometimes preferred dividends are calculated based on the par value and rate, which is what I did. So that seems right.

So the total preferred dividend is $3,000. Now, the total dividend is $50,000, so the remaining must go to common stock. Let's subtract the preferred dividend from the total: 50,000 - 3,000 = $47,000 left for common.

Reeves has 5,000 shares of common stock outstanding. So the common dividend per share would be the remaining $47,000 divided by 5,000 shares. Let me do that: 47,000 / 5,000 = 9.4 dollars per share.

Wait a second, so preferred gets $3 each, common gets $9.40 each. Now looking at the options, let me check which one matches. The options are labeled A to J.

Looking through the options:

Option J says $3 for preferred and $9.40 for common. That's exactly what I calculated. So the correct choice should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recalculate the preferred dividend: 1,000 shares * $50 par * 6% = 1,000 * 50 * 0.06 = 3,000. Yes. Then the common: (50,000 - 3,000) = 47,000. 47,000 / 5,000 = 9.4. Yep, that's correct.

So I think I'm confident that the answer is J.

To determine the dividends per share for Reeves Corporation, we start by calculating the preferred stock dividend. The corporation has 1,000 shares of 6%, $50 par value preferred stock. The dividend per share for preferred stock is calculated as:

\[
\text{Dividend per share (preferred)} = \text{Par value} \times \text{Dividend rate} = 50 \times 0.06 = \$3
\]

The total preferred dividend is then:

\[
\text{Total preferred dividend} = 1,000 \times \$3 = \$3,000
\]

Next, we calculate the remaining dividend for common stock. The total dividend payout is $50,000, and after paying the preferred dividend, the amount left for common stock is:

\[
\text{Remaining for common} = \$50,000 - \$3,000 = \$47,000
\]

Reeves has 5,000 shares of common stock outstanding. The dividend per share for common stock is:

\[
\text{Dividend per share (common)} = \frac{\$47,000}{5,000} = \$9.40
\]

Thus, the dividends per share are $3 for preferred stock and $9.40 for common stock. Comparing this with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**J: $3 for preferred stock, $9.40 for common stock.**
