Question:

This question refers to the following information.
The following quote is from Voltaire in response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.
My dear sir, nature is very cruel. One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.
—Voltaire, in a letter, 1755

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Enlightenment philosophers and the Romantic Movement. I'm a bit rusty on my history, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which Enlightenment philosophe questioned reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement for a specific rationale. The options are A through J, each with a different figure and reason.

From what I remember, the Enlightenment was all about reason, logic, and science. Thinkers like Voltaire, Rousseau, Locke, etc., were big on using reason to understand the world and improve society. But then, the Romantic Movement came as a reaction against the Enlightenment, emphasizing emotion, nature, and individualism.

So the question is about someone who started to question the heavy reliance on reason, which would lead into Romanticism. I think Rousseau was one of the key figures here. He talked a lot about how society corrupts people, that humans are born good but are made bad by civilization. His ideas about the noble savage and the social contract come to mind. He emphasized emotions and the inherent goodness of nature, which aligns with Romantic ideals.

Looking at the options:

Option B says Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls. That fits with what I was thinking. He's often seen as a bridge between the Enlightenment and Romanticism.

Other options: Let's see, Thomas Hobbes was earlier, more about human nature being cruel, but he's not really part of the Romantic movement. Mary Wollstonecraft was more about women's rights, not exactly starting Romanticism. Diderot was an Enlightenment thinker, editor of the Encyclopédie, not sure about him leading Romanticism. John Locke was about tabula rasa and social contracts but not the emotional aspect. Kant was more about ethics and reason, not exactly against reason. Adam Smith is known for economics. Voltaire was a key Enlightenment figure, criticizing organized religion and advocating reason. Hume was a skeptic about reason but more in an Enlightenment context. Montesquieu was about separation of powers. David Hume, I think, was more about empiricism and skepticism, but not starting Romanticism.

So the correct answer should be B: Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.
