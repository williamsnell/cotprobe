Okay, so I've got this generator problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about a self-excited generator, and I need to find the armature and field circuit resistances.

Alright, let's start by gathering the given data. The generator is rated at 10 kW and 250 volts. When delivering the rated load, the armature circuit voltage drop is 5% of the terminal voltage. Also, the shunt-field current is 5% of the rated load current.

First, I should probably find the rated load current. Since power is voltage multiplied by current, P = V * I. The rated power is 10 kW, which is 10,000 watts. So the current I = P/V = 10,000 / 250. Let me calculate that. 10,000 divided by 250 is 40 amps. So the rated load current is 40 A.

Next, the shunt-field current is 5% of this rated current. 5% of 40 is 0.05 * 40 = 2 A. So the field current is 2 amps.

Now, the field is part of the shunt circuit, which is connected across the terminals. The terminal voltage is 250 V. So the field resistance R_shunt can be found using Ohm's Law: V = I * R. Rearranging, R = V / I. So R_shunt = 250 / 2 = 125 ohms. Hmm, wait, looking at the options, option D has field resistance 125, and option I has 100, others have different values.

Now, the armature circuit voltage drop is 5% of the terminal voltage. So 5% of 250 is 12.5 volts. This voltage drop is due to the armature resistance. The armature current would be the sum of the load current and the field current, right? Because in a self-excited generator, the armature current supplies both the load and the field.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the field current is part of the armature current? Or is it separate? Let me think. The generator's armature supplies current to the load and the field. Because the field is a shunt, so the field current is drawn from the armature. So the total armature current is the load current plus the field current.

So the load is drawing 40 A, and the field is drawing 2 A, so total armature current is 42 A.

Wait, but wait again. When the generator is delivering the rated load, the load current is 40 A. But the field current is also drawn from the armature, so the armature current is 40 (load) + 2 (field) = 42 A. So I need to calculate the armature resistance based on this.

The voltage drop in the armature is 12.5 V, and the current is 42 A. So the resistance R_armature is V_drop / I_armature. So R_armature = 12.5 / 42. Let me calculate that. 12.5 divided by 42 is approximately 0.2976 ohms, which is about 0.298 ohms.

So the armature resistance is approximately 0.298 ohms, and the field resistance is 125 ohms.

Looking back at the options:

Option D says armature 0.298 and field 125. So that's a match. Other options don't have these values. Option A has 0.125 and 250, which doesn't fit. Option I has 0.5 and 100, which isn't right. So the correct answer must be option D.

To solve the problem, we start by determining the rated load current using the relationship \( P = V \cdot I \). Given the rated power \( P = 10 \, \text{kW} = 10,000 \, \text{W} \) and terminal voltage \( V = 250 \, \text{V} \), the rated load current is:

\[
I_{\text{load}} = \frac{P}{V} = \frac{10,000}{250} = 40 \, \text{A}.
\]

Next, the shunt-field current is 5% of the rated load current:

\[
I_{\text{field}} = 0.05 \cdot I_{\text{load}} = 0.05 \cdot 40 = 2 \, \text{A}.
\]

The field circuit resistance can be calculated using Ohm's Law, \( R = \frac{V}{I} \), where the terminal voltage is 250 V and the field current is 2 A:

\[
R_{\text{field}} = \frac{V}{I_{\text{field}}} = \frac{250}{2} = 125 \, \Omega.
\]

The armature circuit voltage drop is 5% of the terminal voltage:

\[
V_{\text{drop}} = 0.05 \cdot V = 0.05 \cdot 250 = 12.5 \, \text{V}.
\]

The total armature current is the sum of the load current and the field current:

\[
I_{\text{armature}} = I_{\text{load}} + I_{\text{field}} = 40 + 2 = 42 \, \text{A}.
\]

Using Ohm's Law again, the armature resistance is:

\[
R_{\text{armature}} = \frac{V_{\text{drop}}}{I_{\text{armature}}} = \frac{12.5}{42} \approx 0.298 \, \Omega.
\]

Comparing these values with the options provided, the correct match is:

- Armature Circuit Resistance: \( 0.298 \, \Omega \)
- Field Circuit Resistance: \( 125 \, \Omega \)

This corresponds to **Option D**.
