Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to find the energy dissipated in a resistor. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my classes.

The problem states that the current through a 2-ohm resistor is given by i(t) = cos²(πt). I need to calculate the energy dissipated from t₀ = 0 to t₁ = 5 seconds. Oh right, energy dissipation in a resistor is related to power, which is P = I² R, right? So the energy would be the integral of power over time.

Wait, so energy E is the integral of power from t₀ to t₁. Power is I squared multiplied by resistance R. So E = ∫ P dt = ∫ I² R dt. Since R is a constant here (2 ohms), I can factor that out. So E = R ∫ I² dt from 0 to 5.

Now, I(t) is cos squared πt. So I squared would be [cos²(πt)]², which is cos⁴(πt). Wait, no, wait. Wait, I(t) is cos²(πt), so I² is [cos²(πt)]², which is cos⁴(πt). But wait, wait! No, no, wait a second. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no, no. I(t) is cos squared, so when you square that, it's cos⁴. But wait, wait, maybe I can simplify that using some trigonometric identities to make the integral easier.

Oh right, I remember that cos²(x) can be expressed using the double-angle formula. The identity is cos²x = (1 + cos(2x))/2. So maybe I can use that to rewrite I(t) first, then square it again for I².

Wait no, wait. Let's see. I(t) is cos²(πt), so I²(t) would be [cos²(πt)]² = cos⁴(πt). Alternatively, maybe I can first express I(t) in terms of a double angle identity, then square that.

So first, let me write I(t) as (1 + cos(2πt))/2. Because cos²(θ) = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So I(t) = (1 + cos(2πt))/2.

Then I²(t) would be [(1 + cos(2πt))/2]^2. Let me expand that. That's (1 + 2 cos(2πt) + cos²(2πt)) /4.

Wait, but now I have cos squared terms again. So I need to express cos²(2πt) using the same identity. So cos²(2πt) = (1 + cos(4πt))/2.

So substituting back, I get:

I²(t) = [1 + 2 cos(2πt) + (1 + cos(4πt))/2 ] /4.

Wait, let me compute that step by step. Let me first compute the numerator:

1 + 2 cos(2πt) + [ (1 + cos(4πt) ) / 2 ]

Hmm, to combine these terms, perhaps I should express everything with denominator 2.

So 1 is 2/2, 2 cos(2πt) is (4 cos(2πt))/2, and the last term is (1 + cos(4πt))/2.

So adding all together:

(2/2) + (4 cos(2πt))/2 + (1 + cos(4πt))/2 = [2 + 4 cos(2πt) + 1 + cos(4πt)] / 2.

Wait, 2+1 is 3, so numerator becomes (3 + 4 cos(2πt) + cos(4πt)).

So now, I²(t) is [3 + 4 cos(2πt) + cos(4πt)]/(2*4), because the denominator was 2, and we had divided by 4 earlier.

Wait no, wait: The initial expression was [1 + 2 cos(2πt) + (1 + cos(4πt))/2 ] all divided by 4.

So let me recast it correctly.

Wait, let's try another approach. Let me compute the square correctly.

I(t) = [ (1 + cos(2πt) ) ] / 2.

So I²(t) = [1 + 2 cos(2πt) + cos²(2πt) ] / 4.

Now, cos²(2πt) is (1 + cos(4πt))/2.

So substituting that:

I²(t) = [1 + 2 cos(2πt) + (1 + cos(4πt))/2 ] / 4.

Let me compute the numerator inside the brackets:

1 + 2 cos(2πt) + 1/2 + (cos(4πt))/2.

Combine like terms: 1 + 1/2 is 3/2. So 3/2 + 2 cos(2πt) + (cos4πt)/2.

So putting this back into I²(t):

I²(t) = [ 3/2 + 2 cos(2πt) + (cos4πt)/2 ] /4.

Which is the same as (3/2)/4 + (2 cos2πt)/4 + (cos4πt/2)/4.

Simplify each term:

3/2 divided by 4 is 3/(8).

2 cos2πt divided by 4 is (1/2) cos2πt.

cos4πt / 2 divided by 4 is cos4πt / 8.

So I²(t) = 3/8 + (1/2) cos(2πt) + (1/8) cos(4πt).

Now, the energy E is R times the integral of I² dt from 0 to 5.

So E = R * ∫₀^5 I²(t) dt = 2 * ∫₀^5 [3/8 + (1/2) cos(2πt) + (1/8) cos(4πt) ] dt.

Let me compute each integral term separately.

First, the integral of 3/8 dt from 0 to 5 is (3/8) * t evaluated from 0 to 5, which is (3/8)(5 - 0) = 15/8.

Second term: integral of (1/2) cos(2πt) dt. The integral of cos(ax) dx is (1/a) sin(ax), so this becomes (1/2) * [ (1/(2π)) sin(2πt) ) ] evaluated from 0 to 5.

So (1/2)(1/(2π)) [ sin(2π*5) - sin(0) ].

But sin(2π*5) is sin(10π), which is 0. Similarly, sin(0) is 0, so the entire term is zero.

Third term: integral of (1/8) cos(4πt) dt from 0 to5.

Integral is (1/8) * (1/(4π)) [ sin(4πt) ] from 0 to5.

So (1/(32π)) [ sin(4π*5) - sin(0) ].

Sin(20π) is zero, and sin(0) is zero, so this term is also zero.

So the only term contributing to the integral is 15/8.

So E = 2 * (15/8) = 30/8 = 15/4 = 3.75 joules.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation because 15/4 is 3.75, which is option E.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any errors in the integration steps.

So I²(t) was expanded correctly to 3/8 + (1/2) cos(2πt) + (1/8) cos(4πt). Then when integrating each term over 0 to 5:

Integral of 3/8 dt is 3/8 *5 =15/8.

The other two terms involve sine functions evaluated at integer multiples of π, which are zero. So yes, those terms contribute nothing.

So the total energy is 2*(15/8) = 15/4 = 3.75 J.

Looking at the options, option E is 3.75 J.

To calculate the energy dissipated in the resistor, we start with the formula for energy dissipation:

\[
E = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} P \, dt = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} I^2 R \, dt
\]

Here, \( R = 2 \, \Omega \) and \( I(t) = \cos^2(\pi t) \). Substituting \( I(t) \), we have:

\[
E = 2 \int_{0}^{5} \cos^4(\pi t) \, dt
\]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos^2(x) = \frac{1 + \cos(2x)}{2} \), we rewrite \( \cos^4(\pi t) \) as:

\[
\cos^4(\pi t) = \left( \cos^2(\pi t) \right)^2 = \left( \frac{1 + \cos(2\pi t)}{2} \right)^2
\]

Expanding this:

\[
\cos^4(\pi t) = \frac{1}{4} \left( 1 + 2\cos(2\pi t) + \cos^2(2\pi t) \right)
\]

Using the identity \( \cos^2(x) = \frac{1 + \cos(2x)}{2} \) again for \( \cos^2(2\pi t) \), we get:

\[
\cos^4(\pi t) = \frac{1}{4} \left( 1 + 2\cos(2\pi t) + \frac{1 + \cos(4\pi t)}{2} \right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\cos^4(\pi t) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{2}\cos(2\pi t) + \frac{1}{8}\cos(4\pi t)
\]

Now substitute this back into the integral for \( E \):

\[
E = 2 \int_{0}^{5} \left( \frac{3}{8} + \frac{1}{2}\cos(2\pi t) + \frac{1}{8}\cos(4\pi t) \right) dt
\]

Evaluate each term separately:

1. **First term**: \( \int_{0}^{5} \frac{3}{8} \, dt = \frac{3}{8} \cdot (5 - 0) = \frac{15}{8} \)

2. **Second term**: \( \int_{0}^{5} \frac{1}{2}\cos(2\pi t) \, dt = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2\pi} \left[ \sin(2\pi t) \right]_{0}^{5} \). Since \( \sin(10\pi) = 0 \) and \( \sin(0) = 0 \), this term is zero.

3. **Third term**: \( \int_{0}^{5} \frac{1}{8}\cos(4\pi t) \, dt = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{4\pi} \left[ \sin(4\pi t) \right]_{0}^{5} \). Since \( \sin(20\pi) = 0 \) and \( \sin(0) = 0 \), this term is also zero.

Thus, the only contributing term is \( \frac{15}{8} \). The total energy is:

\[
E = 2 \cdot \frac{15}{8} = \frac{30}{8} = \frac{15}{4} = 3.75 \, \text{J}
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **E: 3.75 J**.
