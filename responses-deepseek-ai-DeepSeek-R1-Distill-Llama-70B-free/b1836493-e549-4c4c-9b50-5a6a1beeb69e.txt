Question:

The true length of a block of wood is 1.010 cm. Three measurements of this block produced the following values: 1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm. Which of the following statements is true concerning these measurements?

Options:

A: They are somewhat precise and somewhat accurate.
B: They are exceptionally accurate but not precise.
C: They are precise but not accurate.
D: They are accurate and slightly precise.
E: They are precise and accurate.
F: They are neither precise nor accurate.
G: They are slightly precise but very accurate.
H: They are very precise but slightly accurate.
I: They are accurate but not precise.
J: They are exceptionally precise but not accurate.

Okay, so I have this question about measurements and their accuracy and precision. Hmm, I remember that accuracy has to do with how close the measurements are to the true value, and precision is about how consistent the measurements are with each other. 

The block of wood's true length is 1.010 cm. The three measurements taken were 1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm. Let me think about each of these.

First, I'll check the accuracy. Each measurement should be close to 1.010 cm. Let's see: 1.4 is way higher, 1.2 is a bit higher, and 0.9 is lower. So none of them are very close to the true value. That suggests the measurements aren't accurate.

Now, precision is about consistency. Let me look at the measurements. They are 1.4, 1.2, 0.9. The difference between them is quite a bit. 1.4 to 1.2 is 0.2 cm, and 1.2 to 0.9 is another 0.3 cm. So the measurements vary quite a lot. That means they're not precise either.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. Precision doesn't depend on the true value, just on how close the measurements are to each other. So if the measurements are spread out, they're not precise. So in this case, the three measurements are all over the place, so they lack precision.

So, putting it together: the measurements are neither accurate nor precise. That would mean the correct answer is F: They are neither precise nor accurate.

Looking at the options, option F says exactly that.

The true length of the block is 1.010 cm, while the measurements obtained are 1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, and 0.9 cm. Accuracy refers to how close the measurements are to the true value, while precision refers to how consistent the measurements are with each other.

1. **Accuracy**: None of the measurements (1.4 cm, 1.2 cm, 0.9 cm) are close to the true value of 1.010 cm. Therefore, the measurements are not accurate.
2. **Precision**: The measurements vary significantly (e.g., 1.4 cm to 0.9 cm), indicating a lack of consistency. Thus, the measurements are also not precise.

Since the measurements are neither accurate nor precise, the correct answer is:

F: They are neither precise nor accurate.

Answer: F
