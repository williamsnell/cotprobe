Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. But I'll take it step by step. The question is about the gravitational force between two spheres in a Cavendish balance. Hmm, I remember that a Cavendish balance is used to measure the gravitational constant, right?

The given values are m = 1 gram, m' = 500 grams, and r = 5 cm. Wait, wait. Oh right, in the Cavendish experiment, there are two masses: the larger one (m') and the smaller one (m). The distance between their centers is r. But wait, in the formula, I think the distance used is the separation between the centers of the two spheres.

So the formula for gravitational force is Newton's law of universal gravitation: F = G*(m*m')/r². G is the gravitational constant, which I think is 6.67e-8 cm³ g⁻¹ s⁻² or something like that. Wait, let me make sure. Yeah, I think that's correct.

Wait, but wait. The units here are grams and centimeters. Oh right, because the standard unit for G is in cm³ g⁻¹ s⁻². So I can plug them in directly without converting to meters or kilograms. That's convenient.

So let me write down the values:
m = 1 gram
m' = 500 grams
r = 5 cm

G is 6.67e-8 cm³/(g·s²)

So plugging into the formula: F = (6.67e-8) * (1 g * 500 g) / (5 cm)²

Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 6.67e-8 * 1 * 500 = 6.67e-8 * 500. Let me calculate that. 500 is 5e2, so 6.67e-8 *5e2 = (6.67 *5) * (1e-8 *1e2) )= 33.35 * 1e-6 = 3.335e-5.

Denominator: (5 cm)^2 = 25 cm².

So F = (3.335e-5) / 25 cm². Let me compute that. 3.335e-5 divided by 25. Well, 3.335 /25 is approximately 0.1334. So 0.1334e-5, which is 1.334e-6 dyne.

Wait, because F is in dynes, right? Since we're using cm and grams, the units should work out. Let me double-check the unit conversions.

Alternatively, let's compute it precisely. 6.67e-8 * 500 = 6.67 * 500 = 3335e-8, which is 3.335e-5. Divide by 25 gives 3.335e-5 /25 = 1.334e-6.

So the force is approximately 1.334e-6 dynes. Looking at the options, option B is 1.33 ×10^-6 dyne. Option H is 1.47e-6, which is higher. So the closest is option B.

Wait, wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recompute the numbers.

6.67e-8 multiplied by (1 *500) is:

6.67 *500 = 3335, and since it's 1e-8, it's 3335e-8 = 3.335e-5.

Divide by 5^2 = 25: 3.335e-5 /25 = (3.335 /25) * 1e-5.

3.335 divided by 25 is 0.1334. So 0.1334e-5 is 1.334e-6.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be approximately 1.33e-6, which is option B.

To compute the gravitational force between the two spheres in the Cavendish balance, we use Newton's law of gravitation:

\[
F = G \cdot \frac{m \cdot m'}{r^2}
\]

### Given:
- \( m = 1 \, \text{g} \)
- \( m' = 500 \, \text{g} \)
- \( r = 5 \, \text{cm} \)
- \( G = 6.67 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm}^3 \, \text{g}^{-1} \, \text{s}^{-2} \)

### Step 1: Compute the numerator
\[
G \cdot m \cdot m' = (6.67 \times 10^{-8}) \cdot (1) \cdot (500) = 6.67 \cdot 500 \cdot 10^{-8} = 3335 \cdot 10^{-8} = 3.335 \times 10^{-5}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the denominator
\[
r^2 = (5)^2 = 25 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Step 3: Compute the force
\[
F = \frac{3.335 \times 10^{-5}}{25} = 0.1334 \times 10^{-5} = 1.334 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{dyne}
\]

### Final Answer:
The computed force is approximately \( 1.33 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{dyne} \), which corresponds to **option B**.
