Question:

Discuss Fiedler's contingency model of leadership.

Options:

A: The model posits that leadership effectiveness arises from the leader's intelligence and experience, rather than the situation or their style.
B: The model asserts that leadership effectiveness is primarily a function of the leader's motivation rather than the situational context or their leadership style.
C: Fiedler's contingency model suggests that a leader's effectiveness is fixed and cannot be changed by understanding situational factors.
D: Fiedler's contingency model of leadership suggests that the effectiveness of a leader is dependent on the interaction between their style and three situational factors: task-structure, leader-member relations and the leader's power.
E: Fiedler's model suggests the effectiveness of a leader is determined solely by their personality.
F: According to the model, the only factor that determines a leader's effectiveness is their ability to communicate clearly and effectively with their team.
G: According to Fiedler, a leader's effectiveness is contingent upon the organization's culture.
H: Fiedler's model implies that a leader's effectiveness is determined by their ability to adapt their style to every situation.
I: Fiedler’s model indicates that the effectiveness of a leader is dependent solely on the economic status of the organization and has no relation to the leader’s style or situational variables.

Okay, so I have this question about Fiedler's contingency model of leadership, and I need to choose the correct option from A to J. Hmm, I remember that Fiedler's model is one of the contingency theories, which means it says that leadership effectiveness depends on the situation. But wait, what exactly does it say?

I think Fiedler's model talks about two main leadership styles: task-oriented and relationship-oriented. Task-oriented leaders focus on getting the job done, while relationship-oriented leaders focus on their people and maintaining good relations. But how does that tie into the model?

Oh right, the model suggests that the effectiveness of a leader depends on the interaction between their style and the situational factors. So the situation has certain factors that make one style better than the other. What are those factors? I think they are called situational variables. Let me recall... I believe there are three key situational factors in Fiedler's model.

The first is task structure. If the tasks are clear and well-defined, that's a structured situation, which might favor a task-oriented leader. The second factor is leader-member relations, which refers to how well the leader gets along with the team. If the relations are good, the leader might have more influence. The third factor is the leader's power position, like their authority and control over resources and rewards.

So putting it all together, Fiedler says that a leader's effectiveness isn't just about their style or the situation alone, but how their style fits with the situation. So, for example, if the situation is very structured and the leader has strong relations with the team, maybe a task-oriented leader would be more effective. Or if the situation is unstructured and the leader has weak relations, perhaps a relationship-oriented leader would do better.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through each one.

Option A says effectiveness comes from leader's intelligence and experience, not the situation. That doesn't sound right because Fiedler's model is about the situation influencing effectiveness, not just the leader's traits.

Option B claims it's about the leader's motivation. No, I don't think Fiedler's model focuses on motivation as the primary factor. It's more about the situation and style fit.

Option C states that effectiveness is fixed and can't be changed by situational factors. That's opposite of what I remember. The model is contingency-based, so effectiveness does change with the situation.

Option D says effectiveness is dependent on the interaction between the leader's style and three situational factors: task-structure, leader-member relations, and the leader's power. That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. So D looks correct.

Option E suggests it's based solely on personality. No, because it's about the fit between style and situation, not just personality.

Option F says effectiveness is only about communication. That's not right either; Fiedler's model isn't focused on communication as the sole factor.

Option G says it's contingent on the organization's culture. I don't recall Fiedler's model mentioning culture specifically. It's more about task structure, relations, and power.

Option H claims leaders need to adapt their style to every situation. Wait, no. I think Fiedler's model actually says that a leader's style is relatively fixed, so they should be placed in situations that fit their style rather than changing their style. So H might not be correct.

Option I says effectiveness is based on economic status. That's unrelated to what I know about Fiedler's model.

So the correct answer should be option D because it correctly identifies the three situational factors and the interaction with the leader's style.

The correct answer is D.
