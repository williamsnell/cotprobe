Question:

Although theoretically any food protein could act as a food allergen, there are eight major food allergens in Europe and North America which account for most of the allergic triggers observed in childhood. Which of the allergens pairings contains an allergen, which is not part of the group of eight major allergens?


Options:

A: Fish, shellfish
B: Soy, peanuts
C: Mustard seeds, lamb,

Okay, so I've got this question about food allergens. Hmm. Let me think. The question is asking which pair of allergens doesn't include one of the major eight. I remember that the major food allergens are a specific group. Wait, what are they again? I think they're the common ones like peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, wheat, soy, fish, and shellfish. Oh right, those are the top eight in North America and Europe.

So the question gives three options, each with two allergens. I need to find the pair where at least one isn't in the top eight. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Fish and shellfish. Both are definitely in the major eight. So this pair is fine, both are major allergens.

Option B: Soy and peanuts. Soy is one of the major ones, and peanuts are too. So both are in the group. This pair is not the answer either.

Option C: Mustard seeds and lamb. Hmm, I don't remember mustard or lamb being part of the top eight. Wait, the major ones are the ones I listed earlier. So mustard seeds and lamb aren't in that group. Which makes this the correct answer because the question is asking which pair contains an allergen not part of the eight. So in this option, both are outside the major eight.

Wait, but the question says "which of the allergens pairings contains an allergen which is not part of the group." So the pair could have one that's not, or both. So in this case, option C has two that are not in the major eight. So the correct answer is option C.

The major food allergens in Europe and North America are peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, wheat, soy, fish, and shellfish. 

- **Option A**: Both fish and shellfish are part of the major eight allergens.  
- **Option B**: Both soy and peanuts are part of the major eight allergens.  
- **Option C**: Neither mustard seeds nor lamb are part of the major eight allergens.  

The question asks for the pairing that contains an allergen not in the major eight. Since both allergens in Option C are outside the major eight, this is the correct answer.  

Answer: C
