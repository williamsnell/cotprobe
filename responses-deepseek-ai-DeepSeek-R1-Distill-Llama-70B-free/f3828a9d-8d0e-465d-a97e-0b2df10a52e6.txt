Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about an automobile battery and compressed air. Hmm, let me see what the question says. The battery delivers 5.2 MJ of electrical energy to start a car. Now, they want to use compressed air at 7 MPa and 25°C to do the same work. I need to find the volume of the tank required so that the compressed air has an availability of 5.2 MJ. The options are given from A to J.

Wait, availability? Oh right, availability in thermodynamics usually refers to exergy, which is the maximum useful work that can be extracted from a system. So the exergy of the compressed air should be equal to 5.2 MJ.

Alright, so the compressed air is at 7 MPa (that's 7 megapascals) and 25 degrees Celsius. I think I need to calculate the exergy (availability) of the compressed air and set it equal to 5.2 MJ, then solve for the volume.

Wait, but how do I calculate the exergy of compressed air? I remember that for an ideal gas, the exergy can be calculated using the formula that accounts for both the work and heat transfer, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think the exergy of a compressed gas can be found using the formula for the maximum work extractable when expanding isothermally, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, isothermal compression isn't the same as the stored exergy. Let me think. For compressed air, the exergy is the potential to do work beyond just the pressure-volume work because it's at a higher pressure than the surroundings.

Ah, right! The formula for the exergy (availability) of compressed air when it's stored is given by the work it can do when expanding to the ambient pressure. Assuming that the ambient pressure is atmospheric, say 100 kPa (but wait, the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I should use standard atmospheric pressure, which is around 101.325 kPa, but sometimes approximated as 100 kPa. I'll go with 100 kPa for simplicity unless told otherwise).

Wait, but what if the process is considered as the compressed air expanding to ambient conditions? So the exergy would be the maximum work obtainable from expanding the compressed air from the high pressure (7 MPa) down to the ambient pressure (let's say 0.101325 MPa, but I might use 0.1 MPa for simplicity).

Wait, no, 1 atmosphere is about 101.325 kPa, so 0.101325 MPa. But sometimes problems approximate it to 0.1 MPa. I'll just note that.

So the exergy (availability) per unit mass would be the maximum work done when expanding from P_high (7 MPa) to P_low (0.101325 MPa), assuming the process is isothermal. Wait, but compressed air in a tank is stored at a certain pressure and temperature, so when you expand it to the environment, it's probably a reversible isothermal expansion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's considered a reversible adiabatic expansion, but that's more complicated.

Wait, no, exergy is calculated based on the environment, so the process is considered as a reversible process from the initial state to the dead state (ambient conditions). So the exergy would be the work done when the gas expands reversibly from (P_high, T_initial) to (P_ambient, T_ambient). But since the problem states the compressed air is at 25°C, which is the same as ambient temperature (assuming ambient is 25°C). If that's the case, then the expansion would be isothermal.

Wait, that's a key point. If the compressed air's temperature is the same as the ambient temperature, then the expansion would be isothermal, and the exergy would be the isothermal work done.

So the formula for the exergy (availability) of a compressed ideal gas when expanding isothermally is:

Exergy (A) = nRT ln(P_high / P_low)

But wait, for isothermal processes, the work done by the gas is W = nRT ln(V_final / V_initial) = nRT ln(P_initial / P_final) because PV = nRT, so V is inversely proportional to P when T is constant.

Wait, but in this case, we're calculating the maximum work the gas can do when expanding from high pressure to low pressure isothermally. So the exergy would be that amount.

Alternatively, since the problem is about compressed air, maybe the mass isn't given, so perhaps the approach is to find the volume of the tank required such that the exergy is 5.2 MJ.

Wait, the problem says the compressed air is at 7 MPa and 25°C. So the exergy of the compressed air is the maximum work obtainable when expanding this air to ambient pressure (say, 0.101325 MPa) at ambient temperature (25°C). So the process would be isothermal because the temperature is the same as the surroundings.

So the exergy per mole would be RT ln(P_high / P_ambient). So the total exergy would be nRT ln(P_high / P_ambient).

But wait, n is the number of moles, which is related to the volume via the ideal gas law: PV = nRT. So n = PV/(RT).

Substituting this into the exergy equation:

Exergy A = (PV/RT) * RT ln(P_high / P_ambient) = PV ln(P_high / P_ambient)

Because R and T cancel out.

So A = P * V * ln(P_high / P_low)

Wait, P here is the pressure of the compressed air, which is P_high, and V is the volume of the tank.

Wait, no, because when the compressed air expands, the pressure changes. The formula I'm using might not directly apply, but let me think again.

Wait, in the formula A = nRT ln(P_high / P_low), n is the number of moles, which is (P V)/(R T). So substituting:

A = (P V)/(R T) * R T ln(P_high / P_low) ) = P V ln(P_high / P_low)

Yes, that's correct. So the exergy (availability) is P * V * ln(P_high / P_low).

Wait, but wait, in this case, the pressure P in the formula is the initial pressure in the tank, which is P_high. So the exergy A is P_high * V_tank * ln(P_high / P_ambient).

So in this problem, A is given as 5.2 MJ (which is 5.2e6 J). P_high is 7 MPa (7e6 Pa), P_ambient is 0.101325 MPa (101325 Pa), and T is 25°C (298.15 K).

Wait, but wait, in the formula, since the process is isothermal, the exergy is calculated as the maximum work obtainable, which is P_high * V * ln(P_high / P_ambient).

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me rederive it.

The exergy for an ideal gas when expanding isothermally from (P_high, T) to (P_ambient, T) is:

A = n R T ln(P_high / P_ambient)

But n = (P_high V) / (R T), so substituting:

A = (P_high V)/(R T) * R T ln(P_high / P_ambient) ) = P_high V ln(P_high / P_ambient)

Yes, so A = P_high * V * ln(P_high / P_ambient)

So A is 5.2e6 J, P_high is 7e6 Pa, P_ambient is 101325 Pa.

So let's plug in the values:

5.2e6 J = 7e6 Pa * V * ln(7e6 / 101325)

Wait, let me compute the ratio first. 7e6 / 101325 ≈ 7e6 / 1e5 = 70, but more accurately:

Compute 7e6 / 101325 = 7000000 / 101325 ≈ let's see: 101325 * 69 = 101325 *70=7,092,750 minus 101,325 gives 6,991,425. So 7e6 /101325 ≈ 69. So ln(69) is approximately 4.234.

Wait, more accurately, let me compute it on calculator.

Compute 7e6 / 101325 = 7000000 / 101325.

Let me compute that:

101325 * 69 = 101325 *70 = 7,092,750; subtract 101325 to get 69 times: 7,092,750 - 101,325 = 6,991,425.

But 7,000,000 is 85075 more than 6,991,425. So 69 times plus 85075/101325 ≈ 69 + ~0.84 = ~69.84.

Wait, maybe I should compute it properly.

7000000 ÷ 101325 ≈ let's compute 101325 × 69 = 6,991,425.

7,000,000 - 6,991,425 = 8,575.

Now, 8,575 ÷ 101325 ≈ approx 0.0846.

So total is 69.0846.

So ln(69.0846) ≈ let's compute that.

I know that ln(64) is about 4.1589 because e^4 is about 54.598, e^4.1 is around 60, e^4.15 is ~67. So 4.15 is e^4.15 ≈ 67. So 69.08 is a bit higher. Let me compute:

e^4.2 = e^4 * e^0.2 ≈ 54.598 * 1.2214 ≈ 54.598 * 1.2214 ≈ approx 66.7.

e^4.23: Let's compute 4.23.

e^0.23 ≈ 1.258.

So e^4.23 = e^4 * e^0.23 ≈ 54.598 * 1.258 ≈ 54.598 *1.25 is 68.2475, plus 54.598 *0.008=0.4368, so total ~68.6843.

But our ratio is ~69.08, so e^4.23 is about 68.68, so 4.23 gives 68.68, and 4.24 would be higher.

Compute e^4.24: e^0.24 ≈ 1.271.

So e^4.24 = 54.598 *1.271 ≈ 54.598 *1.2=65.5176, 54.598 *0.071= approx 3.876, so total approx 69.3936.

So at 4.24, e^4.24 ≈ 69.39, which is higher than our ratio of 69.08. So ln(69.08) is between 4.23 and 4.24.

Using linear approximation:

Between 4.23 (68.6843) and 4.24 (69.3936).

The difference between 4.24 and 4.23 is 0.01 in x, and in y, it's 69.3936 -68.6843=0.7093.

We need to find x where y=69.08.

So from 4.23 (y=68.6843), we need an increase of 69.08 -68.6843=0.3957.

So fraction = 0.3957 / 0.7093 ≈ 0.5578.

So x=4.23 + 0.5578 *0.01 ≈ 4.2356.

So ln(69.08) ≈ 4.2356.

So approximately 4.2356.

So now, let's plug back into the equation.

A = P_high * V * ln(P_high/P_ambient)

So 5.2e6 J = 7e6 Pa * V * 4.2356

Wait, solving for V:

V = 5.2e6 / (7e6 * 4.2356) = (5.2e6) / (7e6 *4.2356 )

Compute denominator: 7e6 *4.2356 = 7e6 *4 =28e6, plus 7e6 *0.2356≈1.65e6 → total ≈29.65e6.

So 5.2e6 / 29.65e6 ≈ 5.2 /29.65 ≈ approx 0.1753 m³.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Compute denominator: 7e6 *4.2356 = 7e6 *4 =28e6, 7e6 *0.2356= 1,650,  (Wait, 7e6 *0.2356 = 7 * 0.2356 *1e6 = 1.6492e6 )

So total denominator is 28e6 +1.6492e6 =29.6492e6 Pa.

Now, 5.2e6 J divided by 29.6492e6 Pa equals V.

So V=5.2e6 /29.6492e6 =5.2 /29.6492 ≈ 0.1753 m³.

Looking at the options, option E is 0.1750 m³, which is very close. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when I approximate, I might make a mistake.

Let me compute 7e6 * ln(7e6 /101325) precisely.

Compute 7e6 /101325 =7000000 /101325.

Let me compute this division accurately.

101325 × 69 = 6,991,425.

7,000,000 -6,991,425 =8,575.

So 8,575 /101325 =approx 0.0846.

So total is 69.0846.

ln(69.0846) as calculated earlier is approximately 4.2356.

So 7e6 * 4.2356 = 7e6 *4 =28e6, 7e6 *0.2356=1,649,200 → total 29,649,200.

So 5.2e6 /29,649,200 → let's compute 5,200,000 ÷29,649,200.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 5200 /29649.2 ≈.

Compute 29649.2 × 0.175 = approximately 29649.2 *0.1=2964.92; 29649.2 *0.07=2075.444; 29649.2 *0.005=148.246. Sum: 2964.92 +2075.444=5040.364 +148.246=5188.61.

But 29649.2 ×0.175 ≈5188.61, which is less than 5200.

So 0.175 gives 5188.61, which is 11.39 less than 5200.

So how much more? Let's see, how much is 11.39 /29649.2 ≈0.000384.

So total is approximately 0.175 +0.000384≈0.175384.

So V≈0.1754 m³, which is very close to option E: 0.1750 m³.

So I think E is the correct answer.

To determine the volume of the tank required for the compressed air to have an availability (exergy) of 5.2 MJ, we use the formula for the exergy of compressed air expanding isothermally from the tank pressure \( P_{\text{high}} \) to the ambient pressure \( P_{\text{ambient}} \). The exergy \( A \) is given by:

\[
A = P_{\text{high}} \cdot V \cdot \ln\left(\frac{P_{\text{high}}}{P_{\text{ambient}}}\right)
\]

Here:
- \( A = 5.2 \, \text{MJ} = 5.2 \times 10^6 \, \text{J} \),
- \( P_{\text{high}} = 7 \, \text{MPa} = 7 \times 10^6 \, \text{Pa} \),
- \( P_{\text{ambient}} = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \),
- \( T = 25^\circ \text{C} = 298.15 \, \text{K} \).

First, calculate the pressure ratio:

\[
\frac{P_{\text{high}}}{P_{\text{ambient}}} = \frac{7 \times 10^6}{101325} \approx 69.0846
\]

Next, compute the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_{\text{high}}}{P_{\text{ambient}}}\right) = \ln(69.0846) \approx 4.2356
\]

Substitute these values into the exergy equation:

\[
5.2 \times 10^6 = 7 \times 10^6 \cdot V \cdot 4.2356
\]

Solve for \( V \):

\[
V = \frac{5.2 \times 10^6}{7 \times 10^6 \cdot 4.2356} = \frac{5.2}{7 \cdot 4.2356} \approx \frac{5.2}{29.6492} \approx 0.1753 \, \text{m}^3
\]

This result is very close to option **E: 0.1750 m³**, which is the best match.

**Answer: E**
