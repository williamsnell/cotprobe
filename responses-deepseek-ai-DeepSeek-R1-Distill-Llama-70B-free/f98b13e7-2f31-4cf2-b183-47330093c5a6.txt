Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The problem says that a 1,000 kg elevator's suspension cable snaps, causing it to fall down the shaft. The emergency brakes stop it before it hits the bottom. It fell 100 meters and started from rest. I need to find the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring it to rest safely. The options are from A to J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that when objects fall, their potential energy converts to kinetic energy. But in this case, the elevator is stopped by brakes, so that kinetic energy must be turned into heat by the brakes. Oh right, because the brakes apply a force to stop the elevator, which does work and generates heat.

Wait, so the potential energy lost by the elevator as it falls should equal the kinetic energy it gains, which then gets dissipated as heat by the brakes. That makes sense.

The formula for potential energy is PE = mgh. Mass is 1000 kg, g is 9.8 m/s², and height is 100 m. Let me calculate that.

PE = 1000 * 9.8 * 100. Let's see, 1000 times 100 is 100,000. Multiply by 9.8, that's 980,000 Joules. Oh wait, 100,000 times 9.8 is indeed 980,000 J.

But wait, the elevator is stopped by the brakes. So all that potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which is then the energy the brakes must dissipate as heat. So the heat should be equal to the potential energy lost, which is 980,000 J. But wait, none of the options exactly match that.

Looking at the options again. Let's see:

A: 500,000 J
B:50,000
C:10,000,000
D:1,000,000
E:100
F:1,000
G:2,000,000
H:100,000
I:5,000,000
J:10,000.

Hmm, 980,000 isn't listed. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Oh wait, wait a second. The elevator is caught by the brakes, so the work done by the brakes is equal to the kinetic energy the elevator has when it's stopped. But the potential energy is mgh, which would be 1000*9.8*100 = 980,000 J. So the heat should be 980,000 J.

But none of the options match exactly. Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the problem says the elevator falls 100 m, but does it come to rest over a distance, or is the stopping done instantaneously? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to use energy conservation, assuming all the potential energy is converted to heat, but perhaps I should calculate the kinetic energy just before the brakes engage.

Wait, if the elevator falls 100 m and starts from rest, its velocity at the bottom (just before the brakes stop it) can be found using kinematic equations. The velocity v can be found by v² = u² + 2gh. Since u is 0, v² = 2gh. So v = sqrt(2gh). Then the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv² = (1/2)m*(2gh) = mgh. So yeah, same as the potential energy. So the kinetic energy is mgh, which is 1000 *9.8 *100 = 980,000 J.

But none of the options is exactly that. Hmm. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, option D is 1,000,000 J, which is close but a bit higher. Option G is 2,000,000, which is double. Option A is 500,000, which is about half.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate. 1000 kg times 9.8 m/s² is 9800 N. Multiply by 100 m: 9800 * 100 = 980,000 J. That's correct.

But the options don't have 980,000. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the elevator doesn't fall the full 100 m before being stopped. Wait, the question says it fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest. So that's the distance it falls before the brakes engage. So yes, it's 100 m.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the work done by the brakes. If the elevator falls 100 m, then its potential energy decreases by mgh. That energy is converted into kinetic energy, which the brakes then have to remove by doing work. So the heat is equal to that kinetic energy, which is 980,000 J.

But again, the options don't have that. So perhaps I should look at the options again. Wait, 980,000 is approximately 1,000,000 J. So maybe the problem expects me to approximate g as 10 m/s². Let me try that.

If g is taken as 10, then PE would be 1000 *10*100 = 1,000,000 J. Oh, that's option D. So maybe the question expects us to use g=10 for simplicity.

That makes sense, because in many textbooks, g is taken as 10 m/s² for problems. So in that case, the answer would be 1,000,000 J, which is option D.

Wait, but the question states the elevator is moving downward and then stopped. So the energy dissipated would be the kinetic energy, which equals mgh. So yeah, that aligns with the approach.

So the correct answer should be D: 1,000,000 J.
</think>

To determine the heat dissipated by the brakes, we analyze the energy transformations. The elevator falls a distance of 100 m, starting from rest, and its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy just before the brakes engage. The brakes then dissipate this kinetic energy as heat to bring the elevator to rest.

The potential energy lost by the elevator is given by:

\[
PE = mgh
\]

where \( m = 1000 \, \text{kg} \), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( h = 100 \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
PE = 1000 \cdot 9.8 \cdot 100 = 980,000 \, \text{J}
\]

This potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which the brakes must dissipate as heat. However, none of the provided options exactly match \( 980,000 \, \text{J} \). A close approximation is \( 1,000,000 \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option D. This discrepancy likely arises because the problem assumes \( g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) for simplicity, which is a common practice in such problems.

Thus, the heat dissipated by the brakes is approximately:

\[
1,000,000 \, \text{J}
\]

The correct answer is:

**D**
