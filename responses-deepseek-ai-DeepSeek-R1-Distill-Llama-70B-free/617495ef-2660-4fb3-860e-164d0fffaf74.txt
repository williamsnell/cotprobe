Okay, so I've got this economics question here about the Federal Reserve buying government bonds and how it affects the money supply. Hmm, I remember that when the Fed buys bonds, it's an expansionary monetary policy, so it should increase the money supply. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact mechanics, so I'll need to think this through.

The question says the Fed buys $100,000 of government bonds from a commercial bank. The required reserve ratio is 10%, banks have no excess reserves, and the public's currency holdings don't change. I need to find out the effect on the money supply.

Wait, I think this involves the money multiplier effect. Oh right, the money multiplier is 1 divided by the required reserve ratio. So if the reserve ratio is 10%, the multiplier is 1/0.10 = 10. That means that an increase in bank reserves should lead to a 10 times increase in the money supply.

But wait, how does buying bonds affect the reserves? When the Fed buys bonds from a bank, it pays for them by adding to the bank's reserves. So the bank's reserves increase by $100,000. Since the bank had no excess reserves before, they can now lend out the excess. So the initial increase is $100,000 in reserves.

But the money supply isn't just the change in reserves. Because when the bank lends out those reserves, it creates new deposits. So each time the bank makes a loan, the borrower deposits the money, which becomes a new checking deposit, increasing the money supply.

Wait, but how does the multiplier exactly work here? The initial injection is $100,000. The money multiplier is 10x, so the total change in money supply should be 100,000 * 10 = $1,000,000. But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a bit simpler. Since the Fed is buying the bonds, the bank's reserves go up by $100,000. Then, because the required reserve ratio is 10%, the bank can lend out 90% of that. Wait, no, the bank's excess reserves would be the difference between their total reserves and required reserves.

Hold on, maybe I should approach this step by step. The Fed buys $100k of bonds from the bank. The bank's assets decrease by $100k in bonds, but their reserves increase by $100k because the Fed adds that to their account.

Now, the bank's reserves have increased by $100k. Since the required reserve ratio is 10%, each time the bank makes a loan, the required reserves go up. Let me think about the initial step.

The bank now has excess reserves of $100k because before the purchase, they had no excess. So they can lend out all $100k. When they do that, the borrower gets the money, which becomes a new deposit. Then, the bank's deposits increase, and their required reserves increase by 10% of that.

Wait, no, the process is that when the bank makes a loan, the borrower's checking account increases, which is part of the money supply (M1). This increases the bank's deposits, which in turn increases the required reserves. So the bank must hold 10% of the new deposits as reserves.

So let's model this. The initial injection is $100k in reserves. The first round: bank can lend all $100k. Deposits increase by $100k, which means required reserves go up by 10% of $100k, which is $10k. So the bank's reserves decrease by $90k (lent out) but must keep $10k more as reserves. Wait, no, the bank's reserves after lending would be:

Original reserves: Let's say before the Fed bought the bonds, the bank had some reserves. After the Fed buys the bonds, they have R = previous reserves + $100k.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total change in money supply using the formula:

Change in Money Supply = Change in Reserves * Money Multiplier.

But wait, the change in reserves here is the $100k. The money multiplier is 1/(reserve ratio) which is 10. So 100k * 10 = $1,000,000 increase in money supply.

But wait, wait another moment. The Fed buys from a commercial bank, so the bank's reserves go up by $100k. But when the bank lends this, each subsequent loan creates more deposits but also more required reserves. So the multiplier should apply.

Yes, that makes sense. So the initial $100k allows the bank to create up to $900k in new loans, because 10% must be held as reserves each time. Wait, no, the multiplier is 10, so the total increase is $1,000,000.

But wait, looking at the options, option G is $1,000,000. But wait, another possibility: sometimes the formula is that the change in money supply is equal to the change in reserves times (1 + (1 - c)/(r)), but when c (currency holdings) is zero, which it is here. So yeah, 1/r = 10.

So the total change should be $1,000,000, which is option G.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to think about it: the Fed adds $100k to the bank's reserves. Since the bank has no excess, this is excess reserves. They can lend all $100k. The borrower deposits it, so the bank now has a deposit liability of $100k, requiring $10k in reserves. So the bank can lend out $90k of the initial $100k. Then, that $90k is deposited again, requiring $9k in reserves, and the bank can lend $81k. This process continues, each time 90% of the previous amount.

So the total money supply increase is 100k + 90k +81k + ... which is a geometric series summing to 100k / (1 - 0.9) )= 1,000k. So that's $1,000,000. So the answer should be G.

When the Federal Reserve buys $100,000 of government bonds from a commercial bank, it increases the bank's reserves by $100,000. Since the required reserve ratio is 10% and banks maintain no excess reserves, the bank can lend out 90% of its new reserves, which is $90,000. When the borrower deposits the $90,000, the bank's deposits increase, and it must hold 10% of these deposits as reserves, leaving it with $81,000 to lend out. This process continues, with each subsequent loan creating new deposits and additional reserves.

The total increase in the money supply can be calculated using the money multiplier formula:

\[
\text{Money Multiplier} = \frac{1}{\text{Required Reserve Ratio}} = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10
\]

Thus, the total increase in the money supply is:

\[
\text{Change in Money Supply} = \text{Change in Reserves} \times \text{Money Multiplier} = 100,000 \times 10 = 1,000,000
\]

This matches the geometric series sum of all the loans and deposits created, confirming that the total increase in the money supply is $1,000,000.

The correct answer is **G: $1,000,000**.
