Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the shortest distance from the origin to a circle defined by the equation x² -24x + y² +10y +160=0. Hmm, alright, I'm a bit rusty on my geometry, but let's try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the equation of a circle is usually given in the form (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius. The given equation isn't in that form though, so I think I need to complete the squares for both x and y terms to rewrite it into the standard form.

Looking at the x terms: I have x² -24x. To complete the square, I take half of the coefficient of x, which is -24. Half of -24 is -12, and squaring that gives 144. So I'll add and subtract 144 for the x part.

Now for the y terms: y² +10y. Half of 10 is 5, and squaring 5 gives 25. So I'll add and subtract 25 for the y part.

Putting it all together, the equation becomes:

(x² -24x +144) -144 + (y² +10y +25) -25 +160 =0.

Simplifying the constants: -144 -25 +160. Let's calculate that. 144 +25 is 169, so 160 -169 is -9. So the equation becomes:

(x-12)² + (y+5)² -9 = 0.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me recheck that. Oh, wait, I think I made a mistake in the signs. The original equation is x² -24x + y² +10y +160=0. So when I add 144 and 25 to complete the squares, I have to subtract them as well to keep the equation balanced.

So let's write it properly:

(x² -24x +144) + (y² +10y +25) = -160 +144 +25.

Because I added 144 and 25 on the left, I must add the same on the right. Wait, no, because the equation is x² -24x + y² +10y +160=0. So when I move the 160 to the other side, it's on the left side. So when I complete the square, I have:

(x² -24x +144) + (y² +10y +25) = -160 +144 +25.

Wait, let's compute the right side: -160 +144 is -16, plus 25 gives 9. So the equation becomes:

(x-12)² + (y+5)² = 9.

Wait no, that can't be right. Because 144 +25 is 169, and the right side is -160 +169 which is 9. Oh wait, yes, because when I move the 160 to the other side, it's -160, and then adding 144 and 25 gives 9. So that's correct.

So the equation is (x-12)² + (y+5)² = 9. Therefore, the center of the circle is at (12, -5), and the radius is the square root of 9, which is 3.

Now, I need to find the shortest distance from the origin (0,0) to this circle. The shortest distance from a point to a circle is the distance from the point to the center of the circle, minus the radius.

So first, let's find the distance between the origin (0,0) and the center (12, -5). The distance formula is sqrt[(x2 -x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. Plugging in the points:

sqrt[(12 -0)^2 + (-5 -0)^2] = sqrt[144 +25] = sqrt[169] =13.

So the distance from origin to center is 13 units. The radius is 3, so the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is 13 -3 =10.

Wait, but wait. What if the origin is inside the circle? Then the shortest distance would be negative, which doesn't make sense, so we'd say the distance is zero. But in this case, the distance from origin to center is 13, which is greater than the radius 3, so the origin is outside the circle.

So the shortest distance is 13-3=10, which would be option I.

Looking at the options, option I is 10. So the correct answer should be I.

To find the shortest distance from the origin to the circle defined by the equation \(x^2 - 24x + y^2 + 10y + 160 = 0\), we first rewrite the equation in standard form by completing the square.

1. **Rewrite the equation**:  
   - For the \(x\)-terms: \(x^2 - 24x\). Completing the square gives \((x - 12)^2 - 144\).  
   - For the \(y\)-terms: \(y^2 + 10y\). Completing the square gives \((y + 5)^2 - 25\).  
   - Substituting these into the original equation:  
     \[
     (x - 12)^2 - 144 + (y + 5)^2 - 25 + 160 = 0
     \]  
   - Simplify the constants: \(-144 - 25 + 160 = 9\).  
   - The equation becomes:  
     \[
     (x - 12)^2 + (y + 5)^2 = 9
     \]  
   - This represents a circle with center \((12, -5)\) and radius \(r = 3\).

2. **Calculate the distance from the origin to the center**:  
   Using the distance formula:  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(12 - 0)^2 + (-5 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{144 + 25} = \sqrt{169} = 13
   \]  

3. **Find the shortest distance to the circle**:  
   The shortest distance from the origin to the circle is the distance from the origin to the center minus the radius of the circle:  
   \[
   \text{Shortest distance} = 13 - 3 = 10
   \]  

Thus, the shortest distance from the origin to the circle is **10**, which corresponds to option **I**.
