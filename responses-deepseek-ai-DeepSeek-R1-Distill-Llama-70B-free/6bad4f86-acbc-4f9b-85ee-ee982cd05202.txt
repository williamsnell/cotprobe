Question:

A school board of a large school district is proposing a new dress code for students. Some students feel that this dress code unfairly targets female students. To see if there is a difference between boys and girls in their opposition to the new dress code, they conduct a poll of 60 randomly selected male and 70 randomly selected female high school students in the district. They find that 66 females oppose the dress code and 50 males oppose the dress code. Which of the following explains why a two-proportion z-test is not appropriate?

Options:

A: There is no alternative hypothesis proposed for this test.
B: The number of successes and the number of failures for the two groups are not all large enough.
C: The shapes of the population distributions are not known.
D: The z-test is not designed for proportions.
E: The sample sizes are too small.
F: The sample sizes are different.
G: The sample wasn't randomly selected.
H: The students who oppose the dress code don't represent the entire population.
I: The sample sizes are too large.
J: The proportions of male and female are not equal.

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about a school district and a dress code. The question is about why a two-proportion z-test isn't appropriate in this situation. Hmm, I remember z-tests are used for comparing proportions between two groups. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: They polled 60 males and 70 females. 50 males opposed the dress code, and 66 females opposed it. So, first, I need to see if the samples meet the requirements for a two-proportion z-test.

Wait, what are the assumptions for a two-proportion z-test? I think it's that each sample must have a certain number of successes and failures. Like, for each group, the number of 'successes' (opposing, in this case) should be at least 5 or 10, and the same for failures. Oh right, the rule is often that each category (success and failure) in each group should have expected counts of at least 5. If that's not met, the test might not be accurate.

Let me calculate the numbers. For males: total is 60, with 50 opposing. So successes for males are 50, failures are 10. For females: 70 total, 66 oppose, so successes 66, failures 4. Wait, females have only 4 in the failure category. That's less than 5. Oh, that's a problem because the expected count is below 5, which violates the assumption.

So the issue here is that one of the groups doesn't have enough failures. The z-test assumes that the sample sizes are large enough so that the sampling distribution is approximately normal. If the cell counts are too small, this approximation doesn't hold, and the z-test isn't appropriate.

Looking at the options now. The question is asking why the two-proportion z-test isn't appropriate. Let's go through the options:

A: No alternative hypothesis. I don't think that's it. The test can be conducted as long as there's a null hypothesis; the alternative is usually two-tailed here.

B: Number of successes and failures not all large enough. Oh, that's exactly what I was thinking. Because females have only 4 failures, which is less than 5.

C: Shapes of population distributions unknown. Wait, z-tests for proportions don't require knowing the population distribution because they use the sample proportions and assume normality due to the CLT. But if the sample size is too small, the CLT doesn't apply, making the z-test unreliable. So this might relate, but I think option B is more specific.

D: Z-test not for proportions. No, that's wrong. Two-proportion z-test is exactly for comparing two proportions.

E: Sample sizes too small. Well, sample sizes can be okay if the cell counts are adequate. Here, the problem isn't the total sample size (n=60 and 70 are decent), but the number in each category.

F: Different sample sizes. That's okay; the z-test handles different sample sizes.

G: Sample wasn't random. There's no info suggesting that, so probably not the issue.

H: Students opposing don't represent the population. I'm not sure; the sample was randomly selected, so that's not the problem.

I: Samples too large. No, that's not an issue.

J: Proportions not equal. That's what they're testing, so the test can handle that.

So the correct answer is B. Because for both groups, the number of successes and failures must be sufficiently large. In this case, females have only 4 failures, which is below the threshold. So the z-test's assumptions aren't met.
</think>

The two-proportion z-test is used to compare the proportions of two independent groups, but it relies on certain assumptions. One key assumption is that the number of successes and failures in each group must be sufficiently large (typically at least 5 in each category). In this scenario, the female group has only 4 failures, which violates this assumption. This makes the z-test inappropriate because the sampling distribution may not be approximately normal, leading to unreliable results.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Not applicable; the test can proceed with a null hypothesis.
- **B**: Correct. The female group has fewer than 5 failures, violating the assumption.
- **C**: While related, the issue is more specific to small cell counts, not unknown distributions.
- **D**: Incorrect; z-tests are designed for proportions.
- **E**: Not the primary issue; sample sizes are adequate, but cell counts are not.
- **F**: Different sample sizes are acceptable for the z-test.
- **G**: No evidence suggests the sample was non-random.
- **H**: The sample was randomly selected, so this is not the issue.
- **I**: Sample sizes are not too large.
- **J**: Unequal proportions are expected in the test.

The correct answer is **B**, as the number of successes and failures in one group is not large enough. 

Answer: B
