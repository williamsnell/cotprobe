Okay, so I have this problem here about the minimum number of people needed in a room to guarantee that there are either 4 mutual friends or 4 mutual strangers. Hmm, sounds like a problem related to graph theory, maybe something to do with Ramsey numbers. I remember Ramsey numbers from my studies, where they deal with conditions under which order must appear. 

Let me think. The classic Ramsey number R(m, n) is the smallest number of vertices such that all undirected graphs of that size contain a clique of size m or an independent set of size n. So in this case, we're looking for R(4,4), I think. Because we want either four mutual friends (which would be a clique of size 4) or four mutual strangers (an independent set of size 4, since strangers don't know each other, meaning no edges between them).

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact value of R(4,4). I remember that R(3,3) is 6. That's the party problem where with six people, there are three mutual friends or three mutual strangers. For R(4,4), I think it's higher. 

I recall some Ramsey numbers. R(3,4) is 9, R(3,5) is 14, but wait, I'm getting confused. No, wait, R(4,4) is actually 18. Or is it 17? I'm not sure. Because sometimes the exact numbers are tricky, and some are proven while others are just bounds. 

Wait, I think R(4,4) is 18. Because for R(s,t), the number is the smallest n such that any graph of n nodes contains a clique of size s or an independent set of size t. So R(4,4) means that with 18 people, you're guaranteed either four who all know each other or four who don't know each other at all. 

So looking at the options, option A is 18, which should be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check. I remember that the Ramsey number R(4,4) is indeed 18. Because for smaller numbers, like 17, it's possible to construct a graph without a 4-clique or 4-independent set. So 18 is the minimum where it's unavoidable.

So the options are A:18, which is the answer.

The problem involves determining the minimum number of people required in a room to guarantee that there are either 4 mutual friends or 4 mutual strangers. This is a classic question related to Ramsey numbers in graph theory. Specifically, we are looking for the Ramsey number \( R(4,4) \), which is the smallest number of vertices such that any undirected graph of that size contains either a clique of size 4 (mutual friends) or an independent set of size 4 (mutual strangers).

The Ramsey number \( R(4,4) \) is known to be 18. This means that with 18 people, it is guaranteed that there will either be 4 mutual friends or 4 mutual strangers. For any number of people less than 18, it is possible to construct a graph where neither condition is met. Therefore, 18 is the minimum number required to ensure one of the two outcomes.

Among the given options, the correct answer is **A: 18**.
