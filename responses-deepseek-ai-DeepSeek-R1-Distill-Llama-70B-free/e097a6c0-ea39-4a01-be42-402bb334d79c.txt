Okay, I have this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's a female fruit fly with linked genes that produce gray body and normal wings. She mates with a male that has black body and vestigial wings. The progeny includes gray-bodied and vestigial-winged flies. Hmm, I need to explain why that happens.

First, I remember that linked genes are on the same chromosome and tend to be inherited together. The female has gray body (let's say G) and normal wings (maybe N), so her genotype would be GG for gray and NN for normal wings, but since the genes are linked, perhaps she is homozygous for a chromosome with G and N. Wait, actually, no, because if the genes are linked, each parent gives one chromosome. So if she's female, she has two X's maybe? No, fruit flies have sex chromosomes, but maybe this is about autosomes.

Wait, fruit flies have three pairs of chromosomes: two autosomes and one sex chromosome. Since the question doesn't mention sex-linked traits, perhaps these are autosomal genes. So the female must be homozygous for the linked genes. Let me think: she has gray body and normal wings, and the male has black body and vestigial wings.

Wait, let's denote the genes. Let's say body color is determined by gene B, where B could be black and b gray. Wing type is another gene, say V for vestigial and v for normal. Wait, but I'm not sure about dominant vs recessive. Typically, vestigial wings are recessive, I think. So let's assume:

- B: black body (dominant), b: gray (recessive)
- V: vestigial wings (dominant), v: normal (recessive)

Wait, but wait. The female has normal wings, which would be recessive (v) if vestigial is dominant (V). Or maybe it's the other way around. Sometimes, vestigial is recessive. I'm a bit confused about that. Let me try to clarify. In fruit flies, the vestigial wing phenotype is a recessive trait. So the presence of at least one dominant allele (say V) would result in normal wings, and vv would be vestigial. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, perhaps the normal wing is dominant. Hmm, this could complicate things.

Wait, maybe I should look at the parents' phenotypes. The male has vestigial wings. If vestigial is recessive, then the male must be homozygous recessive, so genotype vv. The female has normal wings, which would be VV or Vv if V is dominant. But wait, since the genes are linked, the female's genotype on each chromosome would have both traits.

Wait, maybe let's consider that the two genes are linked on the same chromosome. So the female fly has gray body and normal wings. Let's assume that gray body is recessive (so her genotype is bb) and normal wings is dominant (so VV or Vv). But since the genes are linked, let's model her as having chromosomes with B and v, but wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the female fly is homozygous for the linked genes. Let's say each gene has two alleles. Let me try again.

The female has gray body and normal wings. So for body color, if gray is recessive, she must be bb. For wings, if normal is dominant, she is VV or Vv. But she's linked for these traits, so her two chromosomes have certain combinations.

Wait, but the parents' genotypes are as follows: the female has gray body and normal wings. The male has black body and vestigial wings.

Assuming that the female is homozygous for the linked traits. Let's say her chromosomes are G (gray) and N (normal) on each. So her genotype would be GG for gray and NN for normal wings, but since the genes are linked, each chromosome carries both G and N. Wait, but that's not possible unless each chromosome has both genes.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each parent in terms of their gametes. The female is producing gametes, but since the genes are linked, the gametes will usually carry the linked alleles. The male's gametes would also have his linked alleles.

Wait, so the male's phenotype is black body and vestigial wings. So for body color, black is dominant. If he's showing black, perhaps he's BB or Bb. But if the female is gray (recessive), then the offspring's gray phenotype must come from her. Wait, but the male would contribute a B allele if he's Bb, but no, wait: the male has black body, so if the male is homozygous BB, then he can only give B. If he's Bb, he can give B or b. But the female has gray, which is recessive, so she must be bb.

Wait, but if the male is black, he could be BB or Bb. But since the parents produce progeny with gray bodies, that suggests that the male must contribute a recessive allele. But since the male's phenotype is black, which is dominant, he can't be bb. Therefore, perhaps the male is Bb, but that depends on the dominance.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me approach this differently.

The key point is that the genes are linked, so they don't assort independently. The presence of gray body and vestigial wings in the progeny suggests that these traits are being inherited together, but wait, the parents are female (gray, normal) and male (black, vestigial). So let's model their genotypes.

Let me pretend that the two traits are on the same chromosome.

Let me assign:

- B: black body (dominant)
- b: gray body (recessive)
- V: vestigial wings (dominant)
- v: normal wings (recessive)

Wait, but that would mean that the male, who has vestigial wings, would have at least one V allele. But if V is dominant, then V would be present, so his genotype would be VV or Vv. But the female has normal wings, which would be recessive (vv), but wait, that can't be because the genes are linked. Hmm, perhaps I got the dominance wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps normal wings are dominant. So V is dominant (normal) and v is recessive (vestigial). So the female has normal wings, so she could be VV or Vv. The male has vestigial wings, so he must be vv.

So considering that, let's model the parents.

The female has gray body and normal wings. Assuming gray is recessive (b), so her genotype is bb. For wings, since she's normal (V), she could be VV or Vv. But since the genes are linked, let's say each of her chromosomes has the b and V alleles. So her genotype is bV / bV. Because she's female, she has two copies of the chromosome.

Wait, no. Wait, fruit flies are diploid, so each gene has two alleles. So for each gene, she has two alleles. But if the genes are linked, the alleles are on the same chromosome.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each parent in terms of their chromosomes.

The female: since she has gray body (b) and normal wings (V), perhaps each of her chromosomes has the b and V alleles. So her genotype is (bV, bV). But wait, that would make her homozygous for both traits. If that's the case, then she can only produce gametes with b and V.

The male has black body (B) and vestigial wings (v). So his genotype is (BV, bv)? Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Because if the genes are linked, his two chromosomes would have certain combinations. Wait, maybe the male is (BV) and (bv), but that would require recombination. Alternatively, perhaps the male is (Bv) on one chromosome and (Bv) on the other, making him Bvbv. Wait, but that's for two genes. Maybe each chromosome has both alleles.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to model the parents as:

Female: her two chromosomes each have the gray (b) and normal (V) alleles. So she is homozygous: bV / bV.

Male: since he has black (B) and vestigial (v) phenotype, and given that the genes are linked, perhaps his two chromosomes are Bv and Bv? Or maybe Bv and bv? Wait, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The male is hemizygous because he's a fruit fly male. Wait, no, wait. Fruit flies have two sexes: males are XY, females are XX. But for autosomal genes, both males and females have two copies. So for each of the two genes, each parent has two alleles.

Wait, perhaps the female is homozygous for the linked traits, so her genotype is bV bV. The male is Bv Bv? No, that can't be because if he's Bv Bv, he would show the dominant traits.

Wait, perhaps the female's genotype is b V / b V (homozygous), and the male is B v / b v. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the male's phenotype is black and vestigial. If black is dominant, then B would make him black, but if he's B v on one chromosome and b v on the other, that would make him Bb for body color, which is black (dominant), and Vv for wings, which would be normal. But the male's wings are vestigial, so perhaps I have the dominance reversed.

Alternatively, maybe the male is bb for body color, but that can't be because his phenotype is black, which is dominant. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck because I'm not setting up the genotypes correctly.

Let me try this again. Let's make the female's genotype as follows: she has gray body (b) and normal wings (V). Since the genes are linked, her genotype is homozygous, meaning each chromosome has the b and V alleles. So her genotype is bV and bV.

The male has black body (B) and vestigial wings (v). Since the genes are linked, his genotype must be such that each chromosome has either B and v or another combination. But wait, how can he have B and v on the same chromosome? Because if the genes are linked, they're on the same chromosome.

Wait, perhaps the male is Bv on one chromosome and bv on the other. No, because that would require crossing over. Alternatively, perhaps the male is Bv on both chromosomes, making him BvBv, but that would mean he's homozygous for Bv. But then, his phenotype would be black (since B is dominant) and vestigial (v is recessive, but wait, if v is recessive, then having two copies (Bv and Bv) would mean that his phenotype is black and normal wings because V is dominant. But the male has vestigial wings, so perhaps v is dominant. Wait, maybe I've got the dominance backward.

Wait, maybe I should assign the alleles correctly. Let's say:

- Body color: B (black) is dominant, b (gray) is recessive.
- Wing type: V (vestigial) is recessive, v (normal) is dominant.

So:

- Female: gray body (bb) and normal wings (vv or Vv? No, because normal is dominant, so if she has normal wings, she could be VV or Vv. But she's linked, so her chromosomes would have b and V. So her genotype is bV / bV.

- Male: black body (so at least one B allele; possible genotypes are BB or Bb) and vestigial wings (vv, since recessive).

Wait, but if the male is Bb for body color and vv for wings, and the genes are linked, then his chromosomes would be B-v and b-v? Or B-v and B-v? Wait, no, because if the genes are linked, the alleles are on the same chromosome.

Wait, perhaps the male's genotype is Bv / bv. But that would require that during gamete formation, crossing over occurred. But if the genes are linked, they don't assort independently, but crossing over can still happen, producing recombinant chromosomes.

Wait, perhaps the male is Bv on one chromosome and bv on the other. So his genotype is Bv and bv. But that would mean for body color, he has B and b (so Bb, which is black), and for wings, he has v and v (so vv, which is vestigial). That makes sense.

So, the female is bV / bV.

The male is Bv / bv.

Wait, no, because the female is bV / bV, so she can only produce gametes with b and V. The male is Bv and bv. So he can produce gametes with Bv, bv, or, if crossing over occurs, Bv and bv, but perhaps also some recombinant gametes if there's crossing over between the two genes.

Wait, but the parents are female (bV / bV) and male (Bv / bv). So when they mate, what gametes do they produce?

The female can only produce one type of gamete: bV.

The male can produce gametes based on his chromosomes. Without crossing over, he would produce Bv and bv gametes. With crossing over, he could produce Bv, bv, and perhaps some recombinant gametes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the male's genotype is Bv on one chromosome and bv on the other. So during gamete formation, without crossing over, the gametes would be Bv and bv. If crossing over occurs between the two genes, then the gametes could be Bb (no, because the alleles are B and b, but each chromosome has both genes) or maybe Bv and bv, but perhaps also some with bV and BV? Wait, I'm getting confused.

So, the possible gametes from the male without crossing over would be Bv (50%) and bv (50%). With crossing over, which is less likely because the genes are linked, he would produce some recombinant gametes, perhaps BV and bv, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the possible offspring.

The female can only give bV.

The male gives either Bv or bv, assuming no crossing over.

So the offspring would get from the female: bV.

From the male: either Bv or bv.

So the offspring's genotype would be:

- If male gamete is Bv: bV (from mom) and Bv (from dad). So for body color, b from mom and B from dad: Bb (black, dominant). For wings, V from mom and v from dad: Vv (normal, since V is dominant).

Wait, but the wing phenotype is normal, which is dominant. But the question states that some progeny have vestigial wings. So perhaps this scenario doesn't explain that.

Wait, maybe I messed up the dominance for wing type. Let me adjust.

Let me redefine:

- Body color: B (black) dominant, b (gray) recessive.

- Wing type: V (vestigial) recessive, v (normal) dominant.

So, in this case:

- The female has gray body (bb) and normal wings (vv or Vv). But since her genotype is linked as bV, perhaps she's bV / bV, so V is dominant, and she has normal wings.

Wait, that can't be because if she's bV / bV, she has VV for wings, which are normal.

The male has black body (Bb or BB) and vestigial wings (vv).

So the male's genotype would be Bv / bv? Or perhaps Bv on one and bv on the other. Wait, but if the male has vestigial wings (vv), then both alleles are v. So his genotype for the wing gene is vv. Therefore, each of his chromosomes must have v for the wing gene.

So, the male's genotype for the body gene is Bb (since he's black, which is dominant), and for wings, he's vv.

But since the genes are linked, his chromosomes would carry B and v on one, and b and v on the other. So, his genotype is Bv / bv.

So, the female is bV / bV, and the male is Bv / bv.

Now, when they mate, the female can only produce gametes with b and V (bV). The male can produce gametes based on his chromosomes.

Without crossing over, the male's gametes would be Bv (50%) and bv (50%).

So, the offspring would receive:

From mom: bV.

From dad: either Bv or bv.

So, the offspring's genotypes would be:

1. bV (mom) + Bv (dad) → bV Bv → for body: b and B → Bb (black), wings: V and v → Vv (normal, since V is dominant).

2. bV (mom) + bv (dad) → bV bv → for body: b and b → bb (gray), wings: V and v → Vv (normal).

So, the possible phenotypes are:

- Black body, normal wings.

- Gray body, normal wings.

But the question says that some progeny have gray bodies and vestigial wings. So where does the vestigial wing come from?

Ah, wait, perhaps if there's crossing over during gamete formation in the male, he could produce a gamete with b and V, and another with B and v. Wait, but the male's genotype is Bv and bv. Crossing over between the two genes would produce recombinant gametes.

Wait, but if the male has Bv and bv as his two chromosomes, crossing over between the B and v on one and the b and v on the other could result in gametes with B and v (non-recombinant), b and v (non-recombinant), and possibly B and b (but that's not right because each gamete has only one allele per gene). Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, when the male's chromosomes pair during meiosis, the Bv and bv are on homologous chromosomes. Crossing over could occur between the B and v, and the b and v, leading to gametes with B and b on one chromosome and v on the other, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think that during meiosis, the male's chromosomes Bv and bv can cross over, leading to gametes with B and v (non-recombinant), bv (non-recombinant), and perhaps B and b (but that doesn't make sense since each
