Okay, so I've got this question here about theories related to morality. Hmm, let me read it again. It says, "_______ theory can be described as a code of conduct to which all rational beings should adhere. This contrasts with ________ morality which is the code of conduct adopted by a particular group or society." The options are A through J, each pairing two terms.

Alright, I need to figure out which terms go in the blanks. Let me break it down.

The first blank is about a theory that's a code of conduct for all rational beings. That sounds familiar. I remember from my philosophy class that there are different types of ethical theories. One of them is normative ethics. Normative ethics is about what we ought to do, the moral rules and principles that guide behavior. It's like a set of standards that apply to everyone, not just specific groups.

The second blank is about a morality that's specific to a group or society. That must be descriptive morality. Descriptive morality describes the actual moral beliefs and practices of a culture or society. It's more about what people actually do and believe, rather than what they should do.

Wait, let me think again. So the first part is a theory that's universal, applying to all rational beings. Normative ethics fits because it's prescriptive, telling us what should be done. The second part is about a particular group's code, which would be descriptive because it's describing their specific moral practices.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option D says Normative, Descriptive. So that would fit: normative theory as the universal code, and descriptive as the group-specific one.

Wait, are there other options that might fit? Let's check others. Option A: Normative, Ethical. Hmm, not sure. Ethical is a broader term. Option D seems better because it's contrasting the general theory with the specific group's code.

Another way to think: normative is about what should be, descriptive is about what is. So the first blank is normative, the second descriptive. So D is correct.

The question asks about two types of theories related to morality. The first blank refers to a universal code of conduct for all rational beings, which aligns with **normative theory**. Normative theory is prescriptive, outlining what people ought to do based on moral principles. The second blank refers to a code of conduct specific to a particular group or society, which is **descriptive morality**. Descriptive morality focuses on the actual moral beliefs and practices within a culture, rather than universal guidelines.

Among the options, **Option D (Normative, Descriptive)** correctly fills the blanks, as it contrasts the universal nature of normative theory with the group-specific nature of descriptive morality.
