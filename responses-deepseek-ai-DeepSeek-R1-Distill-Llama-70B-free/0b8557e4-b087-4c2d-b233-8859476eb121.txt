Question:

A landlord was the owner of a vacant warehouse. On May 1, the landlord leased the warehouse to the tenant for a term of five years with a renewable option. The leasehold agreement provided in part:"The tenant hereby acknowledges that certain areas of the leased premises are in a state of disrepair and unsafe for the conduct of business. Nonetheless, the tenant agrees to assume full responsibility for the necessary repairs. Furthermore, the tenant agrees to indemnify the landlord for any loss resulting from the condition of the said premises. "Under the terms of the lease, the landlord delivered possession of the warehouse to the tenant on May 2. On that date, an employee of the tenant was working in the warehouse. He was moving some equipment into the warehouse when a section of the ceiling collapsed and fell on him. At the time the landlord and the tenant entered into their lease, only the landlord was aware that the ceiling was defective and needed to be repaired. Although the landlord could have remedied the defect before delivering possession to the tenant, the landlord didn't perform any repair work on the ceiling. The employee initiated suit against the landlord to recover damages resulting from his injury. There are no applicable statutes. If the employee prevails it will be because a

A: landowner's duty of care to third parties cannot be shifted to a tenant by the tenns of a lease.

C: tenant cannot waive the implied warranty of commercial habitability.
D: landlord is absolved of all responsibilities once a lease agreement is signed.
E: landlord's failure to repair the defect is not relevant to the case.
F: covenant to indemnify by a tenant in favor of a land owner is against public policy.
G: tenant's employee was not protected under the leasehold agreement.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about a landlord-tenant situation, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the facts: The landlord owns a warehouse and leased it to a tenant for five years with a renewable option. The lease agreement says that the tenant acknowledges some areas are in disrepair and unsafe. The tenant agrees to take full responsibility for necessary repairs and to indemnify the landlord for any losses from the condition of the premises. The landlord delivered possession on May 2, and on that day, an employee of the tenant was moving equipment when a ceiling section collapsed, injuring him. The landlord knew about the defective ceiling but didn't repair it before handing over possession. Now, the employee is suing the landlord.

The question is, if the employee wins, why is that? The options are A through J.

Hmm. So I remember that landlords have certain duties, especially regarding the condition of the property. I think that even if the tenant takes over possession, the landlord might still be liable for certain defects, especially if they were known and not disclosed properly, or if the landlord had a duty to repair.

Wait, but the lease here says the tenant assumes responsibility for repairs and indemnifies the landlord. So does that mean the landlord is off the hook?

I think the general rule is that a landlord can't shift the duty of care to the tenant in a way that would allow the landlord to avoid liability for known dangers. Especially if the tenant can't reasonably be expected to fix them quickly. Like, if the defect is dangerous and the landlord knew about it, the landlord might still be liable even after leasing.

So looking at the options:

Option A says a landowner's duty to third parties can't be shifted to the tenant via the lease. That sounds familiar. I think the landlord's duty to third parties (like the tenant's employees) isn't something that can be avoided just by putting it in the lease. So even if the tenant agrees to repair, the landlord might still be liable for injuries to the employee because they knew about the defect and didn't fix it.

Option B: Tenant is responsible once possession is transferred. But that doesn't seem right because the landlord's prior knowledge might make them still liable.

Option C: Tenant can't waive implied warranty of habitability. Wait, but this is a commercial lease. I thought the warranty of habitability mainly applies to residential leases. So maybe this isn't the right answer here.

Option D: Landlord is absolved once lease is signed. No, that's not correct. The lease can't absolve the landlord of all responsibilities, especially for known defects.

Option E: Landlord's failure isn't relevant. No, because the landlord knew and didn't fix it, so it's definitely relevant.

Option F: Indemnity is against public policy. I'm not sure. Some states might have rules about this, but the question says no applicable statutes, so maybe it's more about common law.

Option G: Employee not protected under lease. But the lease is between landlord and tenant. The employee is a third party, so the lease's terms wouldn't directly affect the employee's rights against the landlord.

Option H: Strict liability. I don't think landlords are strictly liable just because someone is injured on the property. They have to have been negligent.

Option I: Landlord's duty can be transferred via lease. That doesn't sound right. Duties like care usually can't be transferred; the lease might shift some responsibilities to the tenant, but the landlord could still be liable for certain issues.

Option J: Tenant's acknowledgment absolves landlord. Maybe, but I think if the landlord had knowledge of a dangerous condition and didn't fix it, the acknowledgment by the tenant might not be enough to absolve them, especially if the tenant couldn't have reasonably known or fixed it quickly.

So, putting it together, the employee is a third party (not a tenant), and the landlord knew about the defect. The lease can't shift the duty to protect third parties from the landlord to the tenant. So the correct answer would be A.

The question revolves around a landlord-tenant scenario where the landlord leased a warehouse with known defects, and an employee of the tenant was injured due to a ceiling collapse. The lease agreement stated that the tenant assumed responsibility for repairs and indemnified the landlord. The issue is whether the landlord can avoid liability for the injury despite the lease terms.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Landlord's Duty of Care**: Landlords generally have a duty to ensure premises are safe, especially for known defects, even after transferring possession. This duty cannot be entirely shifted to the tenant, particularly when the defect poses a significant risk and the tenant cannot reasonably address it immediately.

2. **Third-Party Liability**: The injured employee is a third party, not directly bound by the lease terms. The landlord's duty to third parties typically cannot be avoided by lease agreements, as such provisions may not absolve the landlord of liability for known hazards.

3. **Lease Terms and Indemnification**: While the lease states the tenant assumes responsibility for repairs and indemnifies the landlord, such clauses do not necessarily absolve the landlord of liability for injuries caused by known defects, especially when the landlord failed to address them before transferring possession.

4. **Relevant Options**:
   - **Option A**: Correct. A landlord's duty of care to third parties cannot be shifted to the tenant via a lease, making the landlord liable for injuries caused by known defects.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The tenant is not automatically responsible for all injuries once possession is transferred, especially when the landlord knew about the defect.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The warranty of habitability primarily applies to residential leases, not commercial ones.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. A lease does not absolve the landlord of all responsibilities, particularly for known defects.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The landlord's failure to repair is highly relevant, as it directly contributed to the injury.
   - **Option F**: Unlikely. While indemnity clauses may raise public policy concerns, the question focuses on the landlord's duty of care.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The employee, as a third party, is not directly bound by the lease terms.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. Landlords are not strictly liable for injuries; liability depends on negligence.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The landlord's duty of care cannot be transferred via a lease agreement.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. The tenant's acknowledgment does not absolve the landlord of liability for known defects.

The correct answer is **A**, as the landlord's duty of care to third parties cannot be shifted to the tenant by the terms of a lease.
