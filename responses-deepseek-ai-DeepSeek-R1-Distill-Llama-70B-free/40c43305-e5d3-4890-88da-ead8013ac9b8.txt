Okay, so I've got this economics question about excess reserves in the banking system. Hmm, I need to figure out what causes an increase in excess reserves. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should remember what excess reserves are. Excess reserves are the reserves that commercial banks hold beyond what is required by the central bank (the Fed in the US). These are extra funds that aren't being used to make loans or investments. So, when a bank has more reserves than needed, that's excess.

The question is asking which action would increase these excess reserves. Let's look at each option.

Option A: The reserve ratio is decreased. If the reserve ratio (which is the percentage of deposits that must be held as reserves) goes down, banks are required to hold less in reserves. That means they can lend out more, which would actually reduce their excess reserves because they're using those reserves. So this might decrease excess reserves, not increase. So probably not A.

Option B: The discount rate is decreased. The discount rate is the rate at which banks borrow from the Fed. If it's lower, banks might borrow more to increase their reserves. But wait, if they borrow more, they can make more loans, which might reduce excess reserves. Or maybe if they don't need to borrow as much, but I'm not too sure. Maybe this is more about the cost of borrowing and not directly about increasing excess reserves.

Option C: The Fed reduces the amount of money in circulation. If the Fed does this, like through selling securities, it would reduce the money supply. But how does that affect bank reserves? If the Fed sells securities to banks, the banks pay with reserves, so their reserves decrease. That would lower excess reserves. So C might not be the right choice.

Option D: The discount rate is increased. If the discount rate goes up, borrowing from the Fed becomes more expensive. So banks might be less likely to borrow, which could mean they hold onto more reserves. Wait, but if they can't borrow as much, maybe they have fewer reserves. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, if the Fed increases the discount rate, banks might prefer to hold more excess reserves rather than lend them out because borrowing is costlier. Or maybe not, because if they have more reserves, they might lend more. I'm not certain about this one.

Option E: Checking deposits increase. When more people deposit money into checking accounts, the banks' reserves increase because they have more deposits. But the required reserves would also go up because the reserve ratio is applied to a larger deposit base. So excess reserves could increase only if the increase in deposits is more than the required reserves. For example, if reserves go up by more than the required amount, then excess increases. So E might be a possibility.

Option F: Checking deposits decrease. If deposits go down, required reserves also decrease. But if actual reserves don't decrease as much, then excess reserves could increase. Wait, no, because if deposits drop, required reserves drop, so the banks might have more excess if their reserves aren't falling as much. But this depends on whether the Fed is adjusting the money supply. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option G: The Fed sells Treasury securities to commercial banks. When the Fed sells securities, banks buy them using their reserves. So the banks' reserves decrease, which would reduce their excess reserves. So G would decrease excess reserves, not increase.

Option H: The interest rate on loans is increased. If banks raise the interest on loans, they might make more loans, which would reduce their excess reserves. Or, higher rates might encourage more borrowing, again leading to lower excess reserves. So H probably doesn't cause an increase.

Option I: The Fed buys Treasury securities from commercial banks. When the Fed buys securities, it's injecting money into the banks. So the banks' reserves increase. If the reserve requirement stays the same, the excess reserves would increase because the banks have more reserves than needed. So I seems like a good candidate.

Option J: The reserve ratio is increased. If the required reserve ratio goes up, banks have to hold more reserves, which would reduce their excess because they have to keep more. So J would decrease excess reserves.

Putting it all together, the action that increases excess reserves is when the Fed buys securities from banks (Option I). Because buying securities adds to the banks' reserves without changing the reserve ratio, so the excess goes up.

Wait, but let me think again about option E. If checking deposits increase, say by $100, and the reserve ratio is, say, 10%, then required reserves go up by $10, so excess reserves would increase by $90 (if the bank had no excess before). So in that case, E would also lead to an increase in excess reserves. Hmm, so why isn't E correct?

Wait, because the question is about what will definitely increase excess reserves. When the Fed buys securities, it directly adds to bank reserves, which increases excess. But when deposits increase, it depends on where those deposits come from. For example, if the Fed doesn't change the monetary base, an increase in deposits could be from people moving money from savings to checking, which wouldn't change total reserves. But if the increase in deposits is due to the Fed's actions, like open market purchases, then that would add to reserves. Wait, but the option doesn't specify why deposits are increasing. So maybe E isn't necessarily correct because the deposits could increase without the Fed's action, which might not affect the reserves. Alternatively, if the Fed's buying securities (option I), which would increase the money supply and thus could lead to higher deposits, but the direct effect is the injection of reserves.

So the correct answer is I.

To determine which action increases excess reserves in the banking system, it is important to understand that excess reserves are the funds commercial banks hold beyond the required reserves mandated by the central bank (the Fed). The question asks which action would lead to an increase in these excess reserves. Let's analyze each option:

- **A: The reserve ratio is decreased.** If the reserve ratio decreases, banks are required to hold fewer reserves, which would reduce excess reserves as banks can lend out more. This does not increase excess reserves.

- **B: The discount rate is decreased.** A lower discount rate makes borrowing from the Fed cheaper, which might encourage banks to borrow more. However, this does not directly increase excess reserves, as borrowed funds are often used for lending, which reduces excess reserves.

- **C: The Fed reduces the amount of money in circulation.** Reducing the money supply, such as through selling securities, would decrease bank reserves, thereby reducing excess reserves. This does not increase excess reserves.

- **D: The discount rate is increased.** A higher discount rate makes borrowing from the Fed more expensive, which might discourage banks from borrowing. However, this does not directly lead to an increase in excess reserves.

- **E: Checking deposits increase.** An increase in checking deposits could lead to higher required reserves, but whether excess reserves increase depends on the source of the deposit growth. If deposits increase due to the Fed's actions (e.g., buying securities), excess reserves might rise. However, the option does not specify the cause of the deposit increase, so this is less direct.

- **F: Checking deposits decrease.** A decrease in deposits would reduce required reserves, but it does not necessarily lead to an increase in excess reserves unless reserves remain unchanged.

- **G: The Fed sells Treasury securities to commercial banks.** When the Fed sells securities, banks pay with their reserves, reducing their reserves and thus decreasing excess reserves. This does not increase excess reserves.

- **H: The interest rate on loans is increased.** Higher loan interest rates might encourage more lending, which would reduce excess reserves. This does not increase excess reserves.

- **I: The Fed buys Treasury securities from commercial banks.** When the Fed buys securities, it injects money into the banking system, increasing bank reserves. If the reserve ratio remains unchanged, this directly increases excess reserves. This is the most direct and reliable way to increase excess reserves.

- **J: The reserve ratio is increased.** A higher reserve ratio requires banks to hold more reserves, reducing excess reserves. This does not increase excess reserves.

The action that most directly and reliably increases excess reserves is when the Fed buys Treasury securities from commercial banks, as it directly increases bank reserves without changing the reserve ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I**
