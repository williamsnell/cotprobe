Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out the correct translation into predicate logic. The sentence given is "Abdul and Cleopatra are Egyptian." Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that in predicate logic, we often use predicates like E(x) to denote "x is Egyptian." So, the subject here is two people: Abdul and Cleopatra. The predicate is "are Egyptian," which means each of them is Egyptian.

The original statement is a conjunction because it's saying both Abdul and Cleopatra are Egyptian. So, the logical connective here should be "and," which in logic is represented by a dot (•) or an ampersand (&). 

Now, for the predicates, I need to assign each person to the predicate E. So, Abdul would be E(a) and Cleopatra would be E(c). So, putting it together, it should be E(a) • E(c). 

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this structure. Option A is Ea • Ec. Wait, but in predicate logic, the standard notation is E followed by (a) or (c). So, Ea would actually be E(a), right? Similarly, Ec is E(c). So, Ea • Ec is the same as E(a) • E(c), which is exactly what I need.

Wait, but let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option C is Ex • Ey. That seems more like a universal statement, using variables x and y, which doesn't apply here because we're talking about specific individuals, Abdul and Cleopatra. So, Ex and Ey would mean for all x and y, which isn't the case.

Option D is Ex • Ec. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because it uses x and c. But I think that's mixing variables and constants. Since both subjects are specific, we should use constants a and c, not variables. So D doesn't seem right.

Option I is Ae • Ce. Wait, that would mean Abdul is Egyptian and Cleopatra is Egyptian, but written as Ae and Ce. But usually, the predicate comes first, like E(a). So, Ae would mean a is a member of E, which is the same as E(a). So, I think I is E(a) • E(c), which looks correct as well. Wait, but in the options, I is written as Ae • Ce, which would translate to E(a) and E(c). So that's the same as option A.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option A is Ea • Ec, which is E(a) and E(c). Option I is Ae • Ce, which is the same. So, are both A and I correct? But that can't be because the question says "select the best translation."

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the notation. Typically, in predicate logic, the predicate symbol comes first, followed by the arguments in parentheses. So, E(a) is correct. But sometimes, people might write it as aE, meaning a is an element of E. So, Ae would mean a is Egyptian. So, both notations are correct, but the standard in logic is predicate first.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer should be the one that uses E(a) and E(c) connected by a conjunction. So, option A is Ea • Ec, which is E(a) • E(c). Option I is Ae • Ce, which is also correct but uses a different notation. However, in standard predicate logic, the predicate comes first, so I think option A is the more appropriate choice.

Wait, but the options are labeled with uppercase letters. Let me make sure. The question gives the options as A through J, each with certain expressions. So, option A is Ea • Ec, which is E(a) and E(c). Option I is Ae • Ce, which is a is Egyptian and c is Egyptian. Both are correct, but in the context of the question, which of the options is listed as correct?

I think the intended answer is option A because it follows the standard predicate logic notation where the predicate comes first. So, I should choose option A.

The sentence "Abdul and Cleopatra are Egyptian" is a conjunction, meaning both Abdul and Cleopatra are Egyptian. In predicate logic, this is represented as \( E(a) \cdot E(c) \), where \( E(x) \) denotes "x is Egyptian," \( a \) stands for Abdul, and \( c \) stands for Cleopatra. 

Option A, \( Ea \cdot Ec \), corresponds to \( E(a) \cdot E(c) \), which matches the standard predicate logic notation where the predicate precedes the argument. Option I, \( Ae \cdot Ce \), also represents the same meaning but uses a non-standard notation where the argument precedes the predicate. Since the question asks for the best translation, the standard notation in predicate logic makes Option A the most appropriate choice.

Answer: A
