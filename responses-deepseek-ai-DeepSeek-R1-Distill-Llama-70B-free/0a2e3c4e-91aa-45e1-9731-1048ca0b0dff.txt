Options:

A: Arithmetic and Digit Span subtests
B: All subtests except Block Design

E: All Performance subtests
F: Block Design subtest only
G: All subtests except Vocabulary
H: Information and Comprehension subtests
I: All Verbal subtests

Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this question about the classic aging pattern on the WAIS-R. So, the question is asking which subtests show a decline as part of this pattern. I remember that the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) has different subtests categorized into Verbal and Performance sections.

From what I recall, the classic aging pattern refers to how certain cognitive abilities change with age. I think that some abilities, like crystallized intelligence, which are related to knowledge and experience, tend to remain stable or even improve with age. On the other hand, fluid intelligence, which involves problem-solving and speed, tends to decline.

Looking at the WAIS-R subtests, the Verbal subtests include things like Vocabulary, Information, Comprehension, Similarities, Digit Span, and Arithmetic. The Performance subtests include Picture Completion, Picture Arrangement, Block Design, Object Assembly, and Digit Symbol.

Now, the classic aging pattern, if I'm not mistaken, shows a decline in certain Performance subtests. Specifically, Block Design is one that comes to mind because it's a test of spatial ability and problem-solving, which are part of fluid intelligence. So older adults might perform less well on Block Design compared to younger individuals.

Wait, but I also think that Digit Symbol (which is part of the Performance subtests) might show a decline because it involves speed and motor skills. But the question is about the classic pattern, which I believe primarily points to Block Design as the key subtest showing a decline.

Looking at the options, option F says Block Design subtest only. Option E says all Performance subtests, but I think it's specific to Block Design, not all of them. Option A includes Arithmetic and Digit Span, which are Verbal subtests. Wait, no, Arithmetic is a Verbal subtest, and Digit Span is also part of Verbal, I think.

Wait, no. Wait, the WAIS-R subtests: Digit Span is part of the Verbal scale, but it's sometimes considered a working memory test. Arithmetic is also Verbal. So the classic aging pattern doesn't affect those as much. So the decline is more in Performance, particularly Block Design.

So the correct answer should be F: Block Design subtest only.

The classic aging pattern on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) is associated with a decline in fluid intelligence, which involves problem-solving and spatial abilities. Among the subtests, Block Design, a Performance subtest, is specifically noted for showing a decline with age. This decline is consistent with the notion that fluid intelligence decreases as people get older, while crystallized intelligence, which is measured by Verbal subtests, tends to remain stable or improve. Therefore, the correct answer is:

F: Block Design subtest only.
