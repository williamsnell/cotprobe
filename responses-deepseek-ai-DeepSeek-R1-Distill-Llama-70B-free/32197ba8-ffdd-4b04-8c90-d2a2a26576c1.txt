Okay, so I have this differential equation problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The problem is about a spring-mass system described by the initial value problem:

u'' + (1/4)u' + u = k g(t), with u(0)=0 and u'(0)=0.

g(t) is given as u_{3/2}(t) minus u_{5/2}(t), and k is a positive parameter. They've set k=2 and are asking for the time τ after which the absolute value of u(t) is less than 0.1 for all t > τ. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to find u(t), the solution to this differential equation, given the initial conditions. Then, determine when u(t) becomes less than 0.1 in magnitude and stays there.

The equation is a linear second-order ODE with constant coefficients. The right-hand side is a forcing function k g(t), with g(t) being the difference of two unit step functions. So g(t) is 1 between t=3/2 and t=5/2, and zero elsewhere. Wait, let me think: the unit step function u_a(t) is 0 for t < a and 1 for t ≥ a. So u_{3/2}(t) is 1 when t ≥ 1.5, and u_{5/2}(t) is 1 when t ≥ 2.5. So g(t) = u_{1.5}(t) - u_{2.5}(t). That means g(t) is 1 from t=1.5 to t=2.5, and zero otherwise.

So the forcing function is a pulse that's on for one second, starting at 1.5 seconds, and then turns off at 2.5 seconds. So the right-hand side of the ODE is k multiplied by this function. Since k=2, the forcing is 2 during 1.5 ≤ t ≤ 2.5, and zero elsewhere.

So the differential equation can be written as:

u'' + 0.25 u' + u = 2 [for 1.5 ≤ t ≤ 2.5], and 0 otherwise.

But wait, no, more accurately, it's 2 times (u_{1.5}(t) - u_{2.5}(t)), so it's 2 during 1.5 ≤ t ≤ 2.5, and zero otherwise.

Now, I need to solve this ODE with the given initial conditions. Since it's linear, I can use the Laplace transform method. That's probably the easiest way here.

Let me recall the Laplace transforms of derivatives:

L{u''} = s² U(s) - s u(0) - u'(0)
L{u'} = s U(s) - u(0)
So given u(0)=0 and u'(0)=0, the transforms simplify.

So taking the Laplace transform of both sides:

L{u'' + (1/4)u' + u} = L{k g(t)}

Which becomes:

[s² U(s) - s u(0) - u'(0)] + (1/4)[s U(s) - u(0)] + U(s) = k L{g(t)}

But since u(0)=u'(0)=0, this simplifies to:

U(s) [s² + (1/4) s + 1] = k L{g(t)}

So U(s) = [k L{g(t)}] / [s² + (1/4)s + 1]

Now, I need to compute L{g(t)}. Since g(t) is u_{1.5}(t) - u_{2.5}(t), its Laplace transform is:

L{g(t)} = L{u_{1.5}(t)} - L{u_{2.5}(t)} = e^{-1.5 s} / s - e^{-2.5 s} / s.

So putting it all together:

U(s) = [2 (e^{-1.5 s} - e^{-2.5 s}) / s] / [s² + (1/4)s + 1]

So U(s) = 2 (e^{-1.5 s} - e^{-2.5 s}) / [s (s² + (1/4)s + 1) ]

Now, to find u(t), I need to take the inverse Laplace transform of this. Let's split this into two terms:

U(s) = 2 [e^{-1.5 s} / (s (s² + 0.25 s + 1)) ) - e^{-2.5 s} / (s (s² +0.25 s +1)) ) ]

So each term is similar, so I can compute the inverse Laplace of 1/(s (s² +0.25 s +1)) and then apply the time-shifting property.

Let me denote F(s) = 1/(s (s² + 0.25 s +1 )). Then, U(s) = 2 [ e^{-1.5 s} F(s) - e^{-2.5 s} F(s) ) ].

So the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) is f(t) = L^{-1} { F(s) }, and then u(t) would be 2 [ f(t - 1.5) u_{1.5}(t) - f(t - 2.5) u_{2.5}(t) ) ]

So first I need to compute f(t) = L^{-1} { 1 / [s (s² + 0.25 s +1) ] }

Let me factor the denominator in the second part: s² + 0.25 s + 1.

Wait, that's a quadratic. Let me compute its roots.

The quadratic is s² + (1/4) s + 1 = 0.

The discriminant is (1/4)^2 - 4 *1*1 = 1/16 -4 = (1-64)/16 = -63/16, which is negative, so the roots are complex.

So the denominator can be written as (s + α)^2 + β^2, where α is the real part and β is the imaginary part.

Wait, let's compute α and β.

The standard form for complex roots is s = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)] / (2a). Here a=1, b=1/4, c=1.

So roots are s = [-1/4 ± sqrt( (1/4)^2 -4*1*1 ) ] / 2

sqrt(1/16 -4 ) = sqrt( -63/16 ) = i sqrt(63)/4 = i (3√7)/4.

So the denominator can be written as (s + 1/4)^2 + ( (3√7)/4 )^2.

So F(s) = 1/( s [ (s + 1/4)^2 + (3√7/4)^2 ] )

To find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s), I can use partial fractions decomposition.

Let me write F(s) as A/s + (Bs + C)/[ (s + 1/4)^2 + (3√7/4)^2 ]

So:

1/(s (s² + (1/4)s +1 )) = A/s + (Bs + C)/(s² + (1/4)s +1 )

Multiply both sides by s (s² + (1/4)s +1 ):

1 = A (s² + (1/4)s +1 ) + (Bs + C) s

Expand:

1 = A s² + (A/4) s + A + B s² + C s

Group terms by power of s:

s²: (A + B)
s^1: (A/4 + C)
s^0: A

So setting coefficients equal on both sides (left side is 1, so coefficients are 0 except constant term 1):

For s²: A + B = 0 → B = -A
For s: A/4 + C = 0 → C = -A/4
For constant term: A = 1 → So A =1.

So B= -1, C= -1/4.

Therefore:

F(s) = 1/s + ( (-1)s -1/4 ) / (s² + (1/4)s +1 )

Hmm, wait, but I think I made a mistake in the setup. Wait, the denominator after decomposition is s² + (1/4) s +1, but in the Laplace transform, the denominator is (s + a)^2 + b^2, which requires completing the square.

Wait, the denominator s² + (1/4)s +1 can be written as (s + 1/4)^2 + (1 - (1/4)^2 ) = (s + 1/4)^2 + (15/16) = (s + 0.25)^2 + (sqrt(15)/4)^2.

So the denominator becomes (s + 0.25)^2 + (sqrt(15)/4)^2.

So the expression for F(s) is:

F(s) = 1/s + [ (-s - 1/4 ) ] / [ (s + 0.25)^2 + (sqrt(15)/4)^2 ]

Wait, but that seems complicated. Let me think about the inverse Laplace transforms of each part.

The first term, 1/s, inverse transforms to 1.

The second term is [ (-s - 1/4) ] / [ (s + 0.25)^2 + (sqrt(15)/4)^2 ]

Let me write the numerator as (-s - 0.25) = - (s + 0.25 )

So the second term becomes:

- (s + 0.25 ) / [ (s + 0.25 )^2 + (sqrt(15)/4 )^2 ]

Which is - [ (s + 0.25 ) ] / [ (s + 0.25 )^2 + ( sqrt(15)/4 )^2 ]

The inverse Laplace of (s + a) / [ (s +a)^2 + b^2 ] is e^{-a t} cos(b t )

Similarly, the inverse Laplace of b / [ (s +a)^2 + b^2 ] is e^{-a t} sin(b t )

So let me see. The second term is - (s + 0.25 ) / [ (s +0.25)^2 + (sqrt(15)/4 )^2 ]

So that would inverse transform to - e^{-0.25 t} cos( (sqrt(15)/4 ) t )

Putting it all together, F(s) inverse transforms to:

f(t) = 1 - e^{-0.25 t} cos( (sqrt(15)/4 ) t )

Wait, let me check:

Yes, because:

L^{-1} { 1/s } = 1.

L^{-1} { (s + a) / [(s +a)^2 + b^2] } = e^{-a t} cos(b t)

So with a=0.25 and b= sqrt(15)/4.

So yes, f(t) = 1 - e^{-0.25 t} cos( (sqrt(15)/4 ) t )

Wait, but wait, the second term in F(s) is ( - (s + 0.25 ) ), so the inverse transform is - e^{-0.25 t} cos( ... ), right.

So f(t) = 1 - e^{-0.25 t} cos( (sqrt(15)/4 ) t )

Wait, but let me confirm. The Laplace transform of e^{-at} cos(bt) is (s +a ) / [ (s +a )² + b² ]

So yes, the inverse would be correct.

So now, going back to U(s):

U(s) = 2 [ e^{-1.5 s} F(s) - e^{-2.5 s} F(s) ]

So u(t) is 2 [ f(t - 1.5) u_{1.5}(t) - f(t - 2.5) u_{2.5}(t) ) ]

Which is 2 [ f(t - 1.5) for t ≥ 1.5 and f(t - 2.5) for t ≥ 2.5 ]

So u(t) can be written as:

u(t) = 2 f(t - 1.5) - 2 f(t - 2.5), but only when t ≥ 2.5, because both terms are active. Before t=2.5, only the first term exists.

Wait, more accurately:

For t < 1.5: u(t) = 0, because both terms are multiplied by u_{1.5} and u_{2.5}, which are zero.

For 1.5 ≤ t < 2.5: u(t) = 2 f(t - 1.5 )

For t ≥ 2.5: u(t) = 2 [ f(t - 1.5 ) - f(t - 2.5 ) ]

So now, let's write f(t) as 1 - e^{-0.25 t} cos( sqrt(15)/4 t )

So f(t - a) would be 1 - e^{-0.25 (t - a)} cos( sqrt(15)/4 (t - a) )

Therefore, for 1.5 ≤ t < 2.5, u(t) = 2 [ 1 - e^{-0.25 (t - 1.5)} cos( sqrt(15)/4 (t - 1.5) ) ]

And for t ≥ 2.5, u(t) = 2 [ (1 - e^{-0.25 (t -1.5)} cos( sqrt(15)/4 (t -1.5) )) - (1 - e^{-0.25 (t -2.5)} cos( sqrt(15)/4 (t -2.5) )) ) ]

Simplify that:

u(t) = 2 [ 1 - e^{-0.25 (t-1.5)} cos(...) -1 + e^{-0.25 (t-2.5)} cos(...) ]

The 1 and -1 cancel:

= 2 [ - e^{-0.25 (t-1.5)} cos( sqrt(15)/4 (t-1.5) ) + e^{-0.25 (t-2.5)} cos( sqrt(15)/4 (t-2.5) ) ]

So u(t) for t ≥2.5 is 2 [ e^{-0.25 (t-2.5)} cos(...) - e^{-0.25 (t-1.5)} cos(...) ]

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe we can factor out e^{-0.25 t} ?

Alternatively, perhaps we can write it as:

u(t) = 2 e^{-0.25 t} [ e^{0.25 *1.5} cos( sqrt(15)/4 (t -1.5) ) - e^{0.25*2.5} cos( sqrt(15)/4 (t -2.5) ) ]

Wait, let's see:

For the first term in the bracket:

e^{-0.25 (t -1.5)} = e^{-0.25 t + 0.25 *1.5} = e^{-0.25 t} e^{0.375}

Similarly, the second term:

e^{-0.25 (t -2.5)} = e^{-0.25 t} e^{0.625}

So factoring out e^{-0.25 t}, we have:

u(t) = 2 e^{-0.25 t} [ e^{0.375} cos( sqrt(15)/4 (t-1.5) ) - e^{0.625} cos( sqrt(15)/4 (t - 2.5) ) ]

Hmm, that might be useful for analysis.

But let's think about what we need: the time τ after which |u(t)| < 0.1 for all t > τ.

So I need to find when u(t) settles to within ±0.1 and stays there.

Looking at the expression for u(t) when t ≥2.5, it's a combination of decaying exponentials multiplied by cosine terms. So as t increases, the exponential decay will dominate, and u(t) will approach zero.

Therefore, we can model u(t) for t ≥2.5 as:

u(t) = 2 e^{-0.25 t} [ e^{0.375} cos( ... ) - e^{0.625} cos( ... ) ]

Wait, but perhaps it's better to write u(t) in terms of amplitude and phase. The homogeneous solution after t=2.5 will be a decaying oscillation.

Wait, maybe I can combine the two terms into a single sinusoid with a phase shift. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can estimate the envelope of the function to find when it drops below 0.1.

The maximum possible amplitude would be when the cosine terms are at their peak, either +1 or -1. So the maximum possible |u(t)| would be when both cosine terms are aligned to maximize the expression.

But perhaps a better approach is to bound |u(t)|.

Let me note that for t ≥2.5, u(t) is given by:

u(t) = 2 [ e^{-0.25 (t-1.5)} cos( sqrt(15)/4 (t-1.5) ) - e^{-0.25 (t-2.5)} cos( sqrt(15)/4 (t-2.5) ) ]

Let me make substitutions for clarity. Let τ1 = t -1.5 and τ2 = t - 2.5. So τ1 = τ2 +1.0.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can express u(t) in terms of shifted times.

Alternatively, I can consider that for t ≥2.5, the function u(t) is the sum of two exponentially decaying sinusoids. Each term is of the form e^{-α (t - a)} cos(β (t -a)), where α=0.25, β= sqrt(15)/4 (~0.9682), and a is 1.5 or 2.5.

So each term is decaying as e^{-0.25(t - a)}, so their difference would also be decaying, but perhaps with some interference.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write u(t) as a single exponentially decaying sinusoid. Let me try.

Let me write u(t) for t ≥2.5 as:

u(t) = 2 [A e^{-0
