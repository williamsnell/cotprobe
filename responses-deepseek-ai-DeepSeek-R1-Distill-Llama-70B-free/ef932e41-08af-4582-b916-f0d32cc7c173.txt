Question:

In the context of military security, which of the following is not an obvious benefit of adopting a 'critical' theoretical approach?

Options:

A: A more critical approach to military security studies will allow the inclusion or adoption of non-realist paradigms, such as social constructivism.
B: Critical analysis of military security will draw attention back to traditional conceptions of the state-centric paradigm which have been neglected in recent years, with states favouring human security and other non-traditional approaches instead.
C: By implementing a critical analysis we can recognise that traditional conceptions of military security are no longer always salient and may need to be reconsidered.
D: A critical approach would recognise the changing ontology of security in the real world. Such changes are evident in the new ways in which war has been conducted in the 20th and 21st century.

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about military security and critical theory approaches. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is not an obvious benefit of adopting a critical approach. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should understand what a critical theoretical approach entails. From what I remember, critical theory in IR (International Relations) often challenges traditional or dominant paradigms like realism. It emphasizes things like power structures, social constructs, and often critiques state-centric views. So, a critical approach would look beyond just states and consider other actors and factors influencing security.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A more critical approach allows the inclusion of non-realist paradigms like social constructivism. That makes sense because critical theory often incorporates these alternative perspectives. So this is a benefit, meaning it's not the answer.

Option B: Critical analysis draws attention back to traditional state-centric paradigms which have been neglected. Wait, that seems off. If critical theory challenges traditional realist views which are state-centric, then why would it bring attention back to them? I thought critical approaches move away from state-centric towards more inclusive models like human security. So this might be the incorrect benefit, making B the answer.

Option C: Recognizing that traditional conceptions may no longer be salient. That fits with critical theory because it questions existing models and adapts to new realities. So this is a benefit, not the answer.

Option D: Recognizing the changing ontology of security, like new ways of warfare. Critical approaches do account for changes in how security is conceptualized, so this is a benefit. Not the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Option B says that critical analysis draws attention back to state-centric views. If critical theory is about moving beyond state-centric, then this would not be a benefit. Instead, it's the opposite. So the question is asking which is NOT an obvious benefit. So B is not a benefit, making it the correct answer.

I think that's it. Option B is the one that doesn't fit as a benefit of a critical approach.

The correct answer is B.

B
