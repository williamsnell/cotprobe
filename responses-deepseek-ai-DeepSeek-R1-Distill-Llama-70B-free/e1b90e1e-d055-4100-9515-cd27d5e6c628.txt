Okay, so I've got this question about the Younger Dryas, and I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is asking what the Younger Dryas was, and there are options from A to J.

First, I remember that the Younger Dryas is a geological period. I think it's related to climate change, but I'm not exactly sure when it happened. Maybe I can recall when it occurred. I think it was towards the end of the last Ice Age, so maybe around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago? That sounds familiar.

Wait, I remember that after the Ice Age, the Earth was warming up, right? But then there was a sudden cooling period before the climate stabilized again. Yes, that's the Younger Dryas. So it was a cooling event after the warming had begun. So it's a period where the climate got colder again temporarily.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this. Let's go through the options:

Option A: A period of environmental change causing humans to abandon northern Europe. I'm not sure about the human part, but environmental change sounds possible.

Option B: A warming period at the end of the Pleistocene. Wait, the Younger Dryas was a cooling, not warming. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: A period of glacial expansion between 12,900 and 11,600 years ago. Glacial expansion would mean glaciers advancing, which happens when it's colder. The dates seem to fit what I was thinking earlier. So C looks like a candidate.

Option D: Meteorite impact and mass extinction. I don't think the Younger Dryas is known for that. Maybe that's more like the dinosaur extinction event, which was much earlier.

Option E: Volcanic activity causing cooling. I think some theories suggest volcanic eruptions might have contributed, but I'm not sure if that's the main definition.

Option F: Glacial retreat between 10,900 and 9,000 years ago. Wait, that's after the Younger Dryas, right? Because I thought the Younger Dryas was a cold snap before the Holocene, which is the current epoch. So F might be the period after Younger Dryas.

Option G: Cooling in Jurassic. No, that's way too early. Jurassic was like 150 million years ago, way before humans.

Option H: Desertification in Africa. I'm not sure about that, but I think the Younger Dryas had effects in Europe and North America more so.

Option I: Glacial retreat marking Holocene beginning. No, because the Younger Dryas was before the Holocene. The Holocene started after the Younger Dryas ended.

Option J: Glacial expansion in Miocene. Miocene is like 20 million years ago, way before the last Ice Age.

So putting it all together, the Younger Dryas was a period of glacial expansion (so glaciers advanced) and it was a cooling period. The dates I remember are roughly 12,900 to 11,600 years ago, which matches option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. I think the Younger Dryas started around 12,800 years ago and lasted until about 11,500. So option C says between 12,900 and 11,600, which is a bit broader but still correct. So yes, option C is the right choice.

The Younger Dryas was a period of glacial expansion that occurred between 12,900 and 11,600 years ago, marking a temporary return to colder conditions after the initial warming at the end of the last Ice Age. This cooling event interrupted the transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene epoch. Among the provided options, option C accurately describes this period.

Answer: C
