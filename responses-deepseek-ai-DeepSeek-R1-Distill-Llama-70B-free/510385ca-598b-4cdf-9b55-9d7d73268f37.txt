Options:

A: Psychologists now emphasize the functions that an infant can perform considering his lack of development and learning abilities.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about how psychologists' views on infants have changed over the years. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking about the shift in perspective regarding infants. I remember that in the past, people didn't think infants were very capable. Like, maybe they thought babies couldn't really think or learn much. But now, I think the view has changed to seeing infants as more competent.

Let me look at the options. Option A says psychologists now emphasize what infants can do considering their lack of development. Hmm, that sounds a bit contradictory. If they're emphasizing abilities despite lack of development, maybe that's part of the change, but I'm not sure.

Option B claims infants can do complex reasoning like adults. That seems too much. I don't think even modern psychology says infants are like adults in reasoning. They might have some basic abilities, but not complex abstract thought.

Option C suggests infants' behavior is random and not showing cognitive processes. That sounds like the old view, not the current one. So this might be the opposite of the correct answer.

Option D says learning starts at toddler age. I think that's outdated because I remember hearing that infants start learning from birth, maybe even before.

Option E says infants communicate as well as adults. That can't be right. Adults have language, infants don't, so communication levels are different.

Option F describes infants as miniature adults with all capacities. I don't think that's accurate either. Infants develop gradually, so they aren't fully developed.

Option G is that psychologists still see infants as inadequate. That sounds like it's the old view, not the current change.

Option H says psychologists don't study infants anymore. That's not true; there's a lot of research on infant development.

Option I suggests only genetics matter, not environment. I think modern psychology considers both nature and nurture, so this is probably wrong.

Option J states infants are fully developed. Again, that doesn't make sense because infants clearly develop over time.

So, putting it together, the old view was that infants couldn't do much, maybe their behavior was random or they couldn't learn. The new view is that infants are capable of more than previously thought. So the question is about the shift towards recognizing their abilities.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer should reflect that psychologists now see infants as more capable. Option A is about emphasizing functions despite lack of development. That might fit because it's about recognizing what they can do even if they're not fully developed yet.

Wait, another thought: I remember something about Piaget's sensorimotor stage, where infants start with simple reflexes and develop object permanence. But more recent research shows infants have more innate abilities, like understanding some basic physics or social understanding.

So the change is from seeing them as passive, not capable, to active learners with more abilities. So the correct answer should reflect this positive shift.

Looking again, option A says they emphasize functions considering their lack of development. That seems to align because it's about recognizing their current abilities despite not being fully developed.

Alternatively, option B is about complex reasoning, which I don't think is correct. So I'll go with option A.

The way psychologists view infants has shifted over time, moving from a perspective that saw infants as passive and lacking in abilities to one that recognizes their active engagement with the environment and their capacity for learning and development. Historically, infants were often viewed as incapable of complex thought or learning, but modern psychology emphasizes their abilities and the processes through which they develop. 

Analyzing the options, the correct answer must reflect this positive shift. Option A captures this change by highlighting that psychologists now emphasize the functions infants can perform, considering their stage of development. This aligns with the understanding that infants are capable of more than previously thought, even as they continue to grow and develop.

Answer: A
