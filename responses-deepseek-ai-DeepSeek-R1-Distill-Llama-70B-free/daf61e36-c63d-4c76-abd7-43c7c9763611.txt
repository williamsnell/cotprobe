Okay, so I've got this problem about uranium-238's half-life and figuring out how many disintegrations occur in a minute for a 10 mg sample. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that the half-life is the time it takes for half of a sample to decay. The half-life given is 4.5 x 10^9 years. But the question is about disintegrations per minute, so I need to convert that half-life into a smaller time unit, probably seconds or minutes.

Wait, 1 year is about 365 days, each day has 24 hours, each hour 60 minutes, so 365 * 24 * 60. Let me calculate that. 365 *24 is 8760 hours, times 60 gives 525,600 minutes. Oh wait, actually, no. Wait, 365 days * 24 hours/day = 8760 hours. Then 8760 * 60 minutes/hour = 525,600 minutes in a year. So 4.5e9 years is 4.5e9 * 525600 minutes. Wait, but I might need it in seconds for the decay constant, which uses seconds usually.

Alternatively, maybe I should convert the half-life to seconds first. Because the decay constant λ is often in per second. So let's do that.

One year is 3.154e7 seconds (since 60 sec * 60 min *24 hr *365 days = 31,536,000, which is roughly 3.1536e7). So 4.5e9 years is 4.5e9 * 3.1536e7 seconds. Let me compute that:

4.5e9 *3.1536e7 = (4.5 *3.1536) * 1e16. 4.5 *3 is 13.5, 4.5*0.1536 is approx 0.6912. So total is 14.1912e16 seconds. Or 1.41912e17 seconds. Wait, wait, wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait 4.5 *3.1536 = let's compute 4*3.1536 is 12.6144, 0.5 *3.1536 is 1.5768. So 12.6144 +1.5768 is 14.1912. So 4.5e9 *3.1536e7 = 14.1912e16 seconds, which is 1.41912e17 seconds.

Now, the decay constant λ is ln(2) divided by the half-life. So λ = 0.693 / (1.41912e17 s) ≈ let's see, 0.693 / 1.41912e17 = approx 4.88e-18 per second.

But wait, the question is about a 10 mg sample of uranium-238. I need to find how many atoms are in 10 mg of U-238. Because each disintegration corresponds to one atom decaying.

Uranium-238 has a molar mass of about 238 g/mol. So the number of moles in 10 mg is 0.01 g / 238 g/mol. Let me compute that. 0.01 /238 ≈ 4.2017e-5 mol.

Number of atoms is moles multiplied by Avogadro's number, which is approximately 6.022e23 atoms/mol. So 4.2017e-5 mol *6.022e23 atoms/mol = let's compute that.

4.2017e-5 *6.022e23 = (4.2017 *6.022) e( -5 +23 )= let's compute 4 *6 is 24, 0.2017*6 is ~1.21. So 4.2017*6.022 is approx 25.31. So 25.31e18 atoms, which is 2.531e19 atoms.

Wait wait, let me do it more accurately: 4.2017e-5 *6.022e23 = 4.2017 *6.022 = let's compute 4 *6.022 is 24.088, 0.2017 *6.022 is approx 1.215. So total 25.303. So 25.303e18 = 2.5303e19 atoms.

Wait, another way: 0.01 g is 1e-2 g. Molar mass is 238 g/mol. So moles = 1e-2 /238 ≈ 4.2017e-5 mol.

Atoms = 4.2017e-5 *6.022e23 = 4.2017 *6.022 = around 25.3, so 25.3e18 which is 2.53e19 atoms.

Now, the decay constant λ is approx 4.88e-18 per second. The activity A is λ times the number of atoms N. So A = λ*N.

So A = (4.88e-18 s^-1) * (2.53e19 atoms) = let's compute that.

4.88e-18 *2.53e19 = (4.88 *2.53) *1e1 (because exponents -18+19 =1). 4.88 *2.53 is approximately 12.35. So A ≈12.35 *10 =123.5 decays per second.

Wait wait, 4.88 *2.53: 4 *2.5 is 10, 0.88*2.53 is about 2.22, so total around 12.22. So 12.22 *10^1 =122.2 decays per second.

But wait, let me compute more accurately: 4.88 *2.53. Let's compute:

4 *2.53 =10.12

0.88 *2.53 = let's see, 0.8*2.53=2.024, 0.08*2.53=0.2024. So total 2.2264.

So 10.12 +2.2264 =12.3464. So approx 12.35, so 12.35 *10^1=123.5 decays per second.

Then, to find the number of disintegrations in 1 minute, we multiply by 60 seconds.

123.5 *60 = 7408. So approx 7.4e3 decays per minute? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because I have 10 mg of a heavy element with a long half-life, but the activity is much lower.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each step again.

Half-life T½ =4.5e9 years.

Convert to seconds:

1 year = 365 days *24 hours/day *60 min/hour *60 sec/min = 31,536,000 sec, which is about 3.154e7 seconds.

So T½ =4.5e9 yrs *3.154e7 s/yr = 4.5 *3.154e16 s = 14.19e16 s =1.419e17 s.

Decay constant λ = ln(2)/T½ =0.693 / (1.419e17) ≈ 4.88e-18 s⁻¹.

Molar mass of U-238 is 238 g/mol. So 10 mg is 0.01 g.

Moles = 0.01 g / 238 g/mol = 0.01/238 = approx 4.2017e-5 mol.

Number of atoms N = 4.2017e-5 mol *6.022e23 atoms/mol = 2.53e19 atoms.

Activity A=λ*N =4.88e-18 *2.53e19 = (4.88 *2.53) *1e1 = approx 12.35 *10 =123.5 decays per second.

Wait, that's 123.5 per second. Multiply by 60 to get per minute: 123.5 *60=7,410. So about 7.41e3 decays per minute.

But looking at the options, the smallest is 8.56e23, which is way larger than 7e3. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, wait, wait! Oh no, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of moles. Because 10 mg is 0.01 grams, but 238 g/mol is molar mass. So 0.01 /238 is correct, yes.

Wait but 0.01/238 is 4.2017e-5 mol. So 4.2e-5 *6.022e23 = let's compute that again: 4.2e-5 *6e23 is 4.2*6=25.2, and 1e-5 *1e23=1e18. So 25.2e18=2.52e19 atoms. That seems correct.

So λ*N is 4.88e-18 *2.53e19 = around 123.5 per second.

So per minute, 123.5 *60=7,410. So about 7.4e3, but the options are all around 1e23 to 1e24. So I'm off by a factor of 1e20. That suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of λ or N.

Wait, let me recheck λ. T½ is 4.5e9 years, which is 1.419e17 seconds.

λ= ln(2)/T½ = 0.6931/(1.419e17) = approx 4.88e-18 per second. That seems correct.

Wait, but wait, 0.6931/1e17 is 6.93e-18. So 0.6931/(1.419e17) is (6.93e-18)/(1.419)≈4.88e-18. So that's correct.

Number of atoms: 0.01g /238g/mol = approx 4.2e-5 mol. 4.2e-5 *6e23=2.52e19 atoms. Correct.

So A=λ*N=4.88e-18 *2.53e19 = (4.88 *2.53 )e1= approx 12.34 *10=123.4 Bq.

So per minute: 123.4 *60=7,404. So about 7.4e3 decays per minute.

But the options are all around 1e23 or 1e24, which is way larger. So I'm missing something. Oh wait, did I mix up becquerels and something else?

Wait, no. Bq is disintegrations per second. So 123 Bq is 123 per second. So per minute, 7,400.

But the options are in the order of 1e23, which is way way bigger. So I must have made a mistake in the number of moles or atoms.

Wait, maybe I forgot to account for something else. Let me check the molar mass again. Uranium-238 has a molar mass of 238 g/mol, correct. So 0.01g is 1e-2 g. Moles=1e-2 /238= approx 4.2e-5 mol.

Wait, wait! Oh no, wait! 10 mg is 0.01 grams, right? Yes. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the number of atoms again. Let's compute:

moles = 0.01 g / 238 g/mol = 0.01/238 = 0.000042017 mol.

Number of atoms = moles * Avogadro's number.

0.000042017 mol *6.022e23 atoms/mol = 0.000042017 *6.022e23.

Let me compute this: 4.2017e-5 *6.022e23 = (4.2017 *6.022) *1e18.

4.2017 *6.022: Let's compute that accurately.

4 *6 =24, 4*0.022=0.088; 0.2017*6=1.2102; 0.2017*0.022≈0.00443. So adding all:

24 +0.088 +1.2102 +0.00443 ≈25.3. So 25.3e18 = 2.53e19 atoms.

So that's correct.

Hmm, maybe the mistake is in the decay constant. Let me recalculate λ.

T½ =4.5e9 years =4.5e9 *3.154e7 s =4.5e9 *3.154e7 = let's compute 4.5 *3.154 is 14.19, so 14.19e16 s =1.419e17 s.

λ=0.6931/1.419e17 = let's compute that more accurately.

Calculate 0.6931 /1.419e17.

1.419e17 is 1.419 *1e17.

0.6931 /1.419 = approximately 0.488.

So λ=0.488 / 1e17 =4.88e-18 per second. Correct.

So A=2.53e19 *4.88e-18 = let's compute that.

2.53e19 *4.88e-18 = (2.53 *4.88) *1e1 (because 1e19 *1e-18 =1e1).

2.53 *4.88: 2*4.88=9.76, 0.53*4.88≈2.5864. So total ≈12.3464. So 12.3464 *10 =123.464 per second.

So 123.464 per second, times 60 gives 7407.846 per minute, approximately 7.4e3.

But the options are all of the order 1e23-1e24. So I'm missing something. Maybe the initial mass is 10 mg, but perhaps I should have used a different isotope? No, the problem says 238U. Or perhaps I messed up the calculation of moles, but it seems right.

Wait, wait another thing. Maybe the question is about 10 mg, but I thought 10 mg is 0.01 grams. Oh wait, mg is milligrams, so 1 mg is 1e-3 grams. So 10 mg is 0.01 grams, which is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the molar mass. Let me check: U-238 has a molar mass of 238 grams per mole. So 1 mole is 238 grams. So 0.01 grams is 0.01/238 moles. Correct.

So maybe I'm missing a factor of 1e6 somewhere. Let me think. Oh wait, 1 gram is 1e3 milligrams. So 10 mg is 0.01 grams. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should have considered the number of atoms differently. Oh wait, no, moles are in grams, so 0.01 grams is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the activity formula. The formula is A=λN, correct. So that's right.

Wait, but I'm getting 123.5 decays per second, which is 7,410 per minute, but the options are all way higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the number of atoms. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: compute the activity in becquerels, then convert to per minute.

But I don't see where I went wrong. Let me try another angle.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for activity in terms of half-life.

Activity A can also be calculated using A = (N * ln2) / T½.

But N is the number of atoms, and T½ in seconds.

Wait, let's try that.

Number of atoms N = (mass/molar_mass) * Avogadro.

mass is 0.01 g, molar mass 238 g/mol.

So N = (0.01 /238) *6.022e23 = 2.53e19 atoms.

T½ is 4.5e9 years =1.419e17 seconds.

So A = (2.53e19 * 0.6931) /1.419e17.

Compute numerator: 2.53e19 *0.6931 = approx 1.755e19.

Denominator:1.419e17.

So A =1.755e19 /1.419e17 = approx 12.37 *1e2 =1237 per second.

Wait, that's different. Wait, 1.755e19 /1.419e17 = (1.755 /1.419) *1e2.

1.755 /1.419 is approx 1.237. So 1.237 *1e2 =123.7 Bq.

So same as before, about 123.7 decays per second.

So per minute, 123.7 *60=7422, which is ~7.4e3.

But the options are way higher. So perhaps the question is not about 10 mg, but 10 grams? Or maybe I misread the mass.

Wait, the question says 10 mg. So maybe I'm missing something in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the half-life given is for a different unit, like days? No, no, the question says 4.5e9 years, which is correct for U-238.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of 0.01g/(238g/mol) =4.2e-5 mol. Let me compute that accurately.

0.01 /238 = 0.00004201681 mol.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Another approach: Let's compute the number of atoms again.

N=(0.01 g) / (238 g/mol) *6.022e23 = (0.01 /238) *6.022e23.

0.01/238 = 4.20168e-5.

4.20168e-5 *6.022e23 = (4.20168 *6.022) *1e18.

4.20168 *6.022 = let's compute:

4 *6 =24.

4 *0.022=0.088.

0.20168 *6=1.21008.

0.20168 *0.022=0.00444376.

Now sum all these:

24 +0.088 =24
