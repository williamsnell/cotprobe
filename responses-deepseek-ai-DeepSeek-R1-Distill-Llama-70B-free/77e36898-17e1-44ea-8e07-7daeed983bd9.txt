Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Planck's Law and the Stefan-Boltzmann equation. Hmm, let me think through this.

So the question is asking me to compute the total density of black-body radiation E(T) by integrating Planck's Law over all frequencies. The options are from A to J, each with different expressions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember the steps.

Planck's Law gives the spectral radiance, which describes the energy distribution as a function of frequency. The formula is Bν(T) = (hν^3)/(c²) * 1/(e^{hν/(kT)} - 1), right? But wait, sometimes I've seen it expressed in terms of wavelength λ. Oh right, but the integral here is over frequency ν, so I should stick with the ν version.

The total energy density E(T) is the integral of Bν(T) over all possible frequencies from 0 to infinity. So E(T) = ∫₀^∞ Bν(T) dν. Substituting Planck's formula, that becomes E(T) = ∫₀^∞ (hν³)/(c²) * 1/(e^{hν/(kT)} - 1) dν.

Hmm, integrating this directly looks tricky. I remember that this integral relates to some known result involving the Riemann zeta function. Oh wait, the integral of x³/(e^x - 1) dx from 0 to infinity is π^4/15. Let me confirm that. Yes, ∫₀^∞ x³/(e^x -1) dx = ζ(4) * Γ(4), where ζ is the Riemann zeta function and Γ is the gamma function. Γ(4) is 3! = 6, and ζ(4) is π^4/90, so 6 * π^4/90 = π^4/15. So that's the key integral.

Now, let me make a substitution to get the integral into that form. Let x = hν/(kT). Then ν = (kT x)/(h), and dν = (kT/h) dx. Substitute into E(T):

E(T) = ∫₀^∞ [h ( (kT x/h )^3 ) / c² ] * [1/(e^{x} - 1)] * (kT/h) dx.

Simplify each part:

h * (kT x/h)^3 = h * (k³ T³ x³)/(h³) )= (k³ T³ x³)/(h²).

So the first part becomes (k³ T³ x³)/(h² c²).

The denominator stays as c².

So putting it together, E(T) = ∫ [ (k³ T³ x³)/(h² c²) ) * 1/(e^x -1) ) ] * (kT/h) dx.

Wait, let's compute each term step by step. The [h ν^3 / c²] becomes (h * (kT x/h)^3 ) / c². Let's compute that:

h * (k³ T³ x^3) / h^3 ) = (k³ T^3 x^3) / h².

Then, divided by c²: so that's (k³ T^3 x^3) / (h² c²).

And then multiplied by dν, which is (kT/h) dx.

So putting it all together, E(T) becomes:

Integral from 0 to ∞ of [ (k³ T^3 x³)/(h² c²) ) * (1/(e^x -1)) ) * (kT/h) dx ].

Combine the terms:

Numerator: k³ T^3 x^3 * k T = k^4 T^4 x^3.

Denominator: h² c² * h = h^3 c².

So the integrand is (k^4 T^4 x^3) / (h^3 c²) ) * 1/(e^x -1).

The integral of x³/(e^x -1) dx from 0 to ∞ is π^4/15, as I thought earlier. So that integral is π^4/15.

Putting it all together:

E(T) = [k^4 T^4 / (h^3 c^2)] * [π^4/15].

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the factors. Let me recompute the substitution step.

Wait, the substitution x = hν/(k T) → ν = (x k T)/h, so dν = (k T / h) dx.

So substituting into E(T):

E(T) = ∫ [ h ν^3 / (c^2 (e^{hν/(kT)} -1 )) ] dν.

Substitute ν = x k T / h.

So ν^3 = (x^3 k^3 T^3) / h^3.

dν = (k T dx ) / h.

So substituting:

E(T) = ∫ [ h * (x^3 k^3 T^3)/(h^3 c^2) ) / (e^x -1) ) ] * (k T dx)/h.

Let me compute the numerator and denominator:

Numerator:

h * x^3 k^3 T^3 / h^3 → x^3 k^3 T^3 / h^2.

Then, multiplied by (k T / h) from dν: x^3 k^3 T^3 * k T / h^3 → x^3 k^4 T^4 / h^3.

Denominator is c^2 (e^x -1).

So E(T) becomes:

∫ (x^3 k^4 T^4) / (h^3 c^2 (e^x -1)) dx.

Factor out the constants:

E(T) = (k^4 T^4) / (h^3 c^2) ) ∫ x^3 / (e^x -1) dx.

The integral is (π^4/15), so:

E(T) = (k^4 T^4 π^4) / (h^3 c^2 * 15).

Wait, but let me check the exponents. Let's make sure about the exponents.

Wait, alternative approach: Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the total energy density is proportional to T^4. The constant is σ = (π^4 k^4)/(15 h^3 c^3) * something.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with the exponents in substitution. Let me check each step again.

E(T) = ∫ Bν dν = ∫ [ h ν^3/(c² (e^{hν/(kT)} -1 )) ] dν.

Substituting x = h ν/(k T), so ν = x k T/(h).

Then, dν = (k T/h) dx.

Substituting, E(T) becomes:

∫ [ h [ (x k T/h )^3 ] / (c² (e^x -1) ) ] * (k T dx / h )

Let me compute each term:

h * (x k T/h )^3 = h * x^3 k^3 T^3 / h^3 = x^3 k^3 T^3 / h^2.

Divide by c^2: x^3 k^3 T^3 / (h^2 c^2).

Multiply by (k T dx / h ):

So the entire integrand becomes [x^3 k^3 T^3 / (h^2 c^2)] * [k T dx / h ] / (e^x -1 )

= [x^3 k^4 T^4 ] / (h^3 c^2 (e^x -1 )) dx.

So the integral is ∫ x^3 / (e^x -1 ) dx = (π^4/15).

So putting it all together:

E(T) = (k^4 T^4 )/(h^3 c^2) ) * (π^4/15) * (1/ [h^3 c^2? Wait, no, the denominator is h^3 c^2, and the numerator is k^4 T^4.

Wait, no, in my substitution, the denominator after substitution is (h^3 c^2), so when I factor out, E(T) has (k^4 T^4) / (h^3 c^2) ) multiplied by the integral.

Wait, the entire expression after substitution is:

E(T) = (k^4 T^4 / (h^3 c^2)) * ∫ x^3/(e^x -1) dx.

And the integral is π^4 /15, so:

E(T) = (k^4 T^4) * π^4 / (15 h^3 c^2 )

Wait, but wait, the standard Stefan-Boltzmann law is E = (8 π^5 k^4 T^4 )/(15 h^3 c^3 )

Hmm, so comparing, I'm getting E(T) = (k^4 T^4 π^4 )/(15 h^3 c^2 )

But the standard result has 8 π^5 ... and denominator includes c^3. Wait, so perhaps I made a substitution mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the units or dimensions to check.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral I used is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: Planck's law can also be expressed in terms of wavelength, but in this case, we're using frequency. So perhaps when calculating the energy density, the correct integral includes 8 π factors, maybe from considering the number of modes.

Wait, wait, perhaps the integral I did only accounts for one polarization, but in reality, there are two polarizations, so a factor of 2 might come in. Wait, no, actually, in Planck's law, the formula I used already accounts for the two polarizations because it's the total energy. Hmm, or does it?

Wait, in Planck's law, the expression for Bν(T) is the spectral radiance per unit frequency, per unit solid angle, but when integrating over all solid angles, you multiply by 4π. Oh wait no, because the energy density is the integral over all solid angles.

Wait, I think I may have missed a factor of 4π, because the energy density E is the integral of Bν over all solid angles. So Bν is the specific intensity per steradian, so to get the total energy density, you integrate over 4π steradians.

Oh! So I think I forgot that step. So E(T) = 4π ∫ Bν dν.

Wait, let me clarify: The specific intensity Iν is the energy per unit area per unit time per unit frequency per unit solid angle. The energy density u(T) is the integral over all solid angles and frequencies of Iν dν dΩ.

Alternatively, the total energy density E(T) is 4π ∫ Bν dν, because Bν is the specific intensity, and integrating over all solid angles (4π steradians) gives the total.

So in my previous calculation, I didn't include the 4π factor, which comes from integrating over all directions.

So, E(T) = 4π ∫₀^∞ [ h ν^3/(c²) / (e^{hν/(kT)} -1) ) ] dν.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The Planck function Bν gives the intensity per unit solid angle. So when you integrate over all solid angles, you multiply by 4π.

So yes, E(T) = 4π ∫₀^∞ Bν dν.

So in my earlier calculation, the substitution didn't include this 4π factor. So I need to multiply the result by 4π.

So let's redo that.

E(T) = 4π * ∫ [ h ν^3/(c² (e^{hν/(kT)} -1 )) ] dν.

Then, making the substitution x= h ν/(k T), so ν= x k T / h.

So dν = (k T / h) dx.

So E(T) = 4π * ∫ [ h (x k T/h )^3 / (c² (e^x -1 )) ] * (k T dx / h )

Compute the terms:

h * (x^3 k^3 T^3 / h^3 ) = x^3 k^3 T^3 / h^2.

Divide by c²: x^3 k^3 T^3 / (h^2 c² )

Multiply by (k T dx / h ): x^3 k^4 T^4 / (h^3 c^2 )

So the integrand becomes:

x^3 k^4 T^4 / (h^3 c^2 (e^x -1 )) dx.

Factor out the constants:

E(T) = 4π * [k^4 T^4 / (h^3 c^2 ) ] ∫ x^3/(e^x -1 ) dx.

The integral is π^4/15, so:

E(T) = 4π * (k^4 T^4) * π^4 / (15 h^3 c^2 )

So that would be E(T) = (4 π^5 k^4 T^4 ) / (15 h^3 c^2 )

Wait, but that's not matching the options. Let me check the units again. Wait, in the denominator, I have c^2, but in the options, it's c^3. Hmm, so perhaps I missed a factor of c somewhere.

Wait, let me re-examine the substitution.

E(T) = 4π ∫ [ (h ν^3)/(c^2 (e^{hν/(kT)} -1 )) ] dν.

Wait, that's correct. So when I substitute ν = x k T/(h), then the term h ν^3 is h*(x k T/h )^3 = h * x^3 k^3 T^3 / h^3 = x^3 k^3 T^3 / h^2.

So the term [h ν^3 / c^2 ] = x^3 k^3 T^3 / (h^2 c^2 )

Then, dν = (k T / h ) dx.

So when I multiply, the entire integrand becomes:

[ x^3 k^3 T^3 / (h^2 c^2 ) ] * [ k T dx / h ] = x^3 k^4 T^4 dx / (h^3 c^2 )

So E(T) = 4π [k^4 T^4 / (h^3 c^2 ) ] ∫ x^3/(e^x -1 ) dx.

The integral is π^4/15, so:

E(T) = 4π * (k^4 T^4) * (π^4 / 15 ) / (h^3 c^2 )

This gives:

E(T) = (4 π^5 k^4 T^4) / (15 h^3 c^2 )

Wait, but the Stefan-Boltzmann law is E = (8 π^5 k^4 T^4 )/(15 h^3 c^3 )

Hmm, so where's the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution step, perhaps because of the factor of 4π.

Wait, perhaps I should not have included the 4π. Because when we're calculating E(T) as the energy density, perhaps the integral of Bν over frequency and solid angle is already accounted for. Alternatively, perhaps I got the expression for Bν wrong.

Wait, let me double-check Planck's Law. The correct expression for the spectral radiance (specific intensity) is:

Bν(T) = (2 h ν^3 )/(c^2 ) * 1/(e^{h ν/(k T)} -1 )

Wait! Oh wait, no, I think I missed a factor of 2 because of the two polarizations. So the correct Planck's Law includes a factor of 2 for the two possible polarizations. So Bν = 2 h ν^3/(c^2) * 1/(e^{h ν/(kT)} -1 )

Ah, that's where I went wrong earlier. I omitted the factor of 2. So that explains the discrepancy.

So, correcting that, E(T) = 4π ∫ Bν dν = 4π ∫ [ 2 h ν^3/(c^2) * 1/(e^{h ν/(kT)} -1 ) ] dν.

So that's E(T) = 4π * 2 ∫ [ h ν^3/(c^2) * 1/(e^{h ν/(kT)} -1 ) ] dν.

So that's 8π times the integral I computed earlier.

So let's redo the substitution with this factor of 2 included.

E(T) = 4π * 2 ∫ [ h ν^3/(c^2 (e^{h ν/(kT)} -1 )) ] dν.

So E(T) = 8π ∫ [ h ν^3/(c^2 (e^{h ν/(kT)} -1 )) ] dν.

Now, substituting x = h ν/(kT), so ν = x kT / h.

Then, dν = (kT/h) dx.

So the integrand becomes [ h * (x kT/h )^3 ] / (c^2 (e^x -1 )) * (kT/h) dx.

Compute each part:

h * (x^3 k^3 T^3 / h^3 ) = x^3 k^3 T^3 / h^2.

Then, divided by c^2: x^3 k^3 T^3 / (h^2 c^2).

Multiply by (kT/h) dx: x^3 k^4 T^4 / (h^3 c^2) dx.

So the entire integrand is [ x^3 k^4 T^4 ] / (h^3 c^2 (e^x -1 )) dx.

Factor out the constants:

E(T) = 8π * [ k^4 T^4 / (h^3 c^2 ) ] ∫ x^3/(e^x -1 ) dx.

The integral is π^4/15, so:

E(T) = 8π * (k^4 T^4 ) * (π^4 /15 ) / (h^3 c^2 )

So E(T) = (8 π^5 k^4 T^4 ) / (15 h^3 c^
