Question:

A previously healthy 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 2-day history of fever and pain and swelling of the right knee. She remembers injuring the knee while playing soccer last week, but she was able to finish the game. She has no history of rash or joint pain. Her sister has inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 20/min. Examination of the right knee shows swelling, tenderness, warmth, and erythema; range of motion is limited. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: MRI of the right knee
B: X-ray of the right knee
C: Surgical intervention
D: Physiotherapy
E: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy
F: Nuclear scan of the right knee
G: Antibiotic therapy
H: Corticosteroid injection
I: Application of a knee brace
J: Arthrocentesis

Okay, so I've got this question here about a 14-year-old girl with knee pain and swelling. Let me try to break it down. She's previously healthy, so no major medical issues in her past. She's been having fever and right knee issues for two days. She injured the knee playing soccer last week but finished the game, so maybe it wasn't too bad at first. No rash or joint pain history, but her sister has inflammatory bowel disease. Hmm, that might be relevant because some conditions can have genetic components or associated issues.

Her vitals show a high fever, 39°C, which is pretty significant. BP and other vitals seem okay. On exam, the knee is swollen, tender, warm, and erythematous, with limited range of motion. So, these signs—swelling, warmth, redness, pain—those are classic for inflammation, maybe infection. Since she had a recent injury, I'm thinking maybe she developed an infection from that.

So, the question is about the next appropriate management step. The options are from A to J. Let's look at them one by one.

Option A: MRI of the right knee. MRI is good for soft tissue injuries, but it's more detailed and usually not the first step in acute situations unless other tests are inconclusive. Plus, it's expensive and may not be necessary if a simpler test can help.

Option B: X-ray of the right knee. X-rays are good for bone fractures or signs of osteomyelitis, but early in an infection like septic arthritis, X-rays might not show much. Also, she finished the game, so maybe no fracture, but it's possible she had a minor one. But wait, the main issue now is the acute presentation with fever and joint inflammation.

Option C: Surgical intervention. That seems too drastic as an initial step unless there's an emergency like an abscess that needs draining, but I'm not sure yet.

Option D: Physiotherapy. That's more for rehabilitation, not for acute management of possible infection or inflammation.

Option E: NSAIDs. They can help with pain and inflammation, but if it's an infection, NSAIDs alone won't treat the cause. Also, they might mask some symptoms, making it harder to diagnose.

Option F: Nuclear scan. That's usually for things like osteomyelitis or certain infections, but again, it's more advanced and not the first step. Plus, it's not as readily available maybe.

Option G: Antibiotic therapy. That would be needed if it's bacterial, but you can't start blind antibiotics without knowing the cause. Plus, you'd need to identify the pathogen.

Option H: Corticosteroid injection. That's more for inflammatory conditions like arthritis, but steroids can suppress the immune system and might worsen an infection if that's the case.

Option I: Knee brace. That's for support, but doesn't address the underlying issue causing the symptoms.

Option J: Arthrocentesis. That's joint aspiration. Oh right, when you suspect septic arthritis, especially with these symptoms—fever, swollen, hot joint—the next step is to tap the joint to get synovial fluid for analysis. This can confirm infection and guide treatment.

So, putting it together: she has signs of a septic joint—fever, knee inflammation. The next step should be to perform arthrocentesis to check for infection. Starting antibiotics without knowing might be risky, but with a positive culture from the fluid, you can tailor treatment. Alternatively, if it's not infected, you can consider other causes like a hemorrhagic effusion from trauma or inflammatory conditions.

So the answer should be J: Arthrocentesis.

The patient is a 14-year-old girl presenting with fever, knee swelling, tenderness, warmth, erythema, and limited range of motion after a recent soccer injury. Her symptoms suggest a possible septic arthritis, which requires immediate investigation. Among the options provided, arthrocentesis (joint aspiration) is the most appropriate next step. It allows for the analysis of synovial fluid to confirm infection, guide antibiotic therapy, and rule out other causes such as traumatic effusion or inflammatory conditions. Other options like MRI, X-ray, or antibiotics are either unnecessary at this stage or could delay diagnosis.

Answer: J
