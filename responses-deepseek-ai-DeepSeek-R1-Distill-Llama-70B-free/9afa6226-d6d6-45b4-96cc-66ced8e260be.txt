Question:

The Experimental Company is now producing and selling 17,000 units of product per year at a sales price of $250 each. It has had a profit objective of 20 percent return on a $2,000,000 investment. Its present cost structure is as follows: Manufacturing costs: Fixed costs $400,000 per year Variable costs $175 per unit produced Selling and administration expenses: Fixed expenses $135,000 per year Variable expenses $25 per unit sold Ten hours are required to produce a unit of product. The company is interested in pushing its rate of operations to 100 percent of its capacity-20,000 units of product. It believes that it can raise its price by up to 5 percent of the present sales price without cutting its present sales volume. In addition, it believes that it can increase its sales to productive capacity with minor design and quality improvements that will increase variable manufacturing costs by $5 per unit, and with accompanying promotion that will increase its variable selling and administration expenses by $5 per unit for all units sold. The company would like to achieve a profit objective of 25 percent on its investment. REQUIRED: 1) Can the company, within the price increase limitation indicated, achieve its new profit objective by reaching full utilization of capacity with the increased variable costs and expenses required? 2) What would the sales price have to be to achieve the new profit objective? 3) What sales price would achieve the old profit objective?

Options:

A: $258.00, $259.50/unit, $253.00/unit
B: $257.50, $258.75/unit, $252.00/unit
C: $269.00, $269.50/unit, $263.00/unit
D: $262.50, $261.75/unit, $255.00/unit
E: $255.50, $262.75/unit, $265.00/unit

Okay, so I've got this problem about the Experimental Company, and I need to figure out the answers to three questions. Let's take it step by step because it's a bit complex. I'll start by understanding the current situation and then move on to the changes they plan to make.

First, the company is producing and selling 17,000 units per year at a price of $250 each. Their profit objective was a 20% return on a $2,000,000 investment. Now, they want to push their production to 100% capacity, which is 20,000 units. To do this, they might have to change their pricing and costs a bit.

The cost structure is as follows:
- Manufacturing costs: Fixed at $400,000 per year, variable at $175 per unit.
- Selling and admin expenses: Fixed at $135,000 per year, variable at $25 per unit sold.

Each unit takes 10 hours to produce. But I don't think the time per unit affects the costs directly because we're given the variable costs per unit, so maybe that's just extra info.

Now, the company wants to increase sales to 20,000 units. They think they can do this by:
1. Raising the price by up to 5% without cutting current sales (17k units).
2. Making minor design and quality improvements that will increase variable manufacturing costs by $5 per unit.
3. Adding promotion that increases variable selling expenses by $5 per unit for all units sold.

And their new profit objective is 25% on the investment.

So the questions are:
1. Can they reach the new profit objective within the 5% price increase?
2. What sales price is needed to achieve the new profit objective?
3. What price to achieve the old (20%) profit objective?

I'll start by calculating the required profit for both the old and new objectives.

Old objective: 20% of $2,000,000 = 0.2 * 2,000,000 = $400,000 desired profit.

New objective: 25% of $2,000,000 = 0.25 * 2,000,000 = $500,000 desired profit.

First, let's tackle question 1: Can they achieve the new profit objective with the increased costs and within the 5% price increase?

They plan to sell 20,000 units. Let's calculate their costs and revenues under the new scenario.

First, the price can be increased by up to 5%, so new price would be up to 250 * 1.05 = $262.50. So the maximum price they can set is $262.5.

But to find out if they can reach the new profit, we'll calculate the total costs and see if the profit is at least $500k when they sell 20k units at the new price.

Wait, but if they increase the price, will their sales volume stay the same or increase? The problem says they can raise the price by up to 5% without cutting their present sales volume (17k). But they want to increase sales to 20k. So perhaps the price increase applies when they're selling beyond 17k? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the problem says: "It believes that it can raise its price by up to 5 percent of the present sales price without cutting its present sales volume." So if they raise the price by 5%, their current sales (17k) won't be affected. But they want to sell up to 20k, which would require perhaps a lower price? Or maybe they can keep the higher price and still sell 20k because of the design improvements and promotions.

Wait, no, the problem says that to increase beyond current sales (to reach 20k), they need to make minor design improvements and promote more, which will increase their variable costs by $5 in manufacturing and $5 in selling per unit. So perhaps the 5% price increase is to sell the same 17k units, but to sell more (up to 20k), they have to invest in improvements and promotions, which increases their costs.

So, in the scenario where they're selling 20k units, their variable costs are higher, and their selling expenses are higher.

So, let's structure the problem.

Under the new plan, selling 20k units:

- Price per unit: Let's assume they set a new price. The maximum they can raise is 5%, which is $262.5. But maybe they don't need to go that high. So we'll need to calculate based on the new costs and see if the price can be set within 5% to achieve the profit.

But for question 1, I think we can assume that they set the maximum allowed price, which is $262.5, and see if that's enough to reach the desired profit of $500k.

Alternatively, maybe the price is somewhere below that, but let's proceed.

Calculating the new costs:

Manufacturing:
Fixed = $400,000
Variable per unit now is $175 + $5 = $180
So total manufacturing cost = 400,000 + (20,000 * 180)

Selling and Admin:
Fixed = $135,000
Variable per unit now is $25 + $5 = $30
Total selling = 135,000 + (20,000 * 30)

Let me compute these:

Manufacturing:
400,000 + (20,000 * 180) = 400,000 + 3,600,000 = $4,000,000

Selling:
135,000 + (20,000 *30) = 135,000 + 600,000 = $735,000

Total costs = 4,000,000 + 735,000 = $4,735,000

Revenue would be 20,000 units * price.

If the price is $262.5, revenue is 20,000 * 262.5 = 5,250,000.

Profit would be 5,250,000 - 4,735,000 = 515,000. Which is more than the required $500k. So yes, they can achieve the new profit objective within the 5% price increase. So the answer to question 1 is yes.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Manufacturing variable cost: 175 +5 = 180. 20k *180 = 3,600k. Fixed 400k. So total 4,000k.

Selling variable: 25+5=30. 20k*30=600k. Fixed 135k. Total 735k.

Total costs: 4,000 + 735 = 4,735k.

At price 262.5, revenue is 20k *262.5=5,250k. Profit is 5,250 -4,735=515k.

Yes, which is above 500k. So yes, they can achieve the new profit.

So question 1 is yes.

Now, question 2: What price is needed to achieve the new profit objective (25% or $500k). So we need to find the price P where:

Total Revenue - Total Costs = 500,000.

Revenue = 20,000 * P.

Total costs are 4,735,000 as before.

So:

20,000P = 4,735,000 + 500,000 = 5,235,000

P = 5,235,000 /20,000 = 261.75.

So the required price is $261.75.

Which is within the 5% increase (262.5 is max). So yes, they can do it.

Question 3: What sales price would achieve the old profit objective (20%, $400k).

So same setup, but desired profit is $400k.

So:

Revenue - Costs = 400,000.

20,000P = 4,735,000 +400,000 =5,135,000

P=5,135,000 /20,000=257.75.

So $257.75 per unit.

Now, looking at the options, each option lists three prices. Let's see:

The options are labeled A through J, each with three values. Let's see what the questions are asking:

1) Can they achieve new profit? Yes, so the first part of the answer is yes.

But the options don't have a yes/no; they list three prices for each option, corresponding to the three questions. Wait, the options are labeled as possible answers for the three questions, but the questions are:

1) Can they achieve new profit with 5% price increase? (Yes/No)
2) Price to achieve new profit.
3) Price to achieve old profit.

But the options are a set of three prices, so perhaps the options are providing the answers to each question as (Q1: yes or no, Q2: price, Q3: price). But the way the options are presented, each option is three prices, perhaps in the order of (price for Q2, price for Q3, maybe another value). Wait, looking back:

The options are:

Each option lists three prices: e.g., A) 258, 259.5, 253.

Wait, perhaps the first number is the price that can be charged without losing sales (up to 5%), the second is the price needed for the new profit, and the third is the old profit. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the options might represent the answers to the three questions in order.

Wait, the problem states that the options are the answers to the three questions. So each option is a triplet: (Q1 answer, Q2 answer, Q3 answer). But the options are presented as "$xxx, $yyy/unit, $zzz/unit". So perhaps the first is the maximum price (5% increase), the second is the price needed for new profit, and third is for old.

Wait, the first part of the problem says: "It can raise its price by up to 5 percent of the present sales price without cutting present sales volume." So the maximum price is 250 *1.05=262.5. So the maximum possible price is $262.5. But for the new scenario (20k units), perhaps the price can be lower, as in the calculations above.

But the options list the first number as, for example, option B: 257.5, then 258.75, then 252.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's see. The three answers are:

1) Can they achieve new profit within the 5% limit? Yes, as we saw when P is 261.75, which is under 262.5.

2) The price needed for new profit is 261.75.

3) The price needed for old profit is 257.75.

Looking at the options, let's see which option has these values.

Looking at option B: 257.5, 258.75, 252.

No, that doesn't match.

Option D: 262.5, 261.75, 255.

Wait, no. Wait, option D lists 262.5 as the first value, which is the 5% increase. The second is 261.75, which is our Q2 answer. Third is 255, which is not what we have for Q3 (257.75). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount the calculations.

Wait, in the scenario for question 3, the desired profit is $400k, same as the old objective. So using the same cost structure but now selling 20k units.

Wait, no, the cost structure changes when selling 20k. So in that scenario, the variable costs are higher, so when calculating for the old profit, it's 20k units with the new variable costs.

So the calculation for question 3 is correct: P=257.75.

Looking at the options, let's see which has 261.75 as the second value. Looking at each option:

Option D: second is 261.75. So for question 2, that's correct.

Option D's third value is 255. But our Q3 answer is 257.75. So that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me recheck.

For question 3: Desired profit is $400k.

Total costs at 20k units:

Manufacturing: 400k +20k*(175+5)=400k +20k*180=400k+3.6M=4,000,000.

Selling: 135k +20k*(25+5)=135k+600k=735k.

Total costs=4,735k.

So profit needed is 400k.

So revenue needed is 4,735k +400k=5,135k.

Revenue is 20k*P=5,135k.

So P=5,135,000 /20,000 = 257.75.

Yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options again, the closest match is option B: 257.5, 258.75, 252. No, that's not matching. Option D has 262.5, 261.75, 255. Option I's third value is 260, which is higher than our 257.75.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the options incorrectly. Let me list all options:

Option A: 258.00, 259.50/unit, 253.00/unit

Option B: 257.50, 258.75/unit, 252.00/unit

Option C: 269.00, 269.50/unit, 263.00/unit

Option D: 262.50, 261.75/unit, 255.00/unit

Option E: 255.50, 262.75/unit, 265.00/unit

Option F: 267.50, 268.00/unit, 262.50/unit

Option G: 270.00, 270.50/unit, 265.00/unit

Option H: 263.50, 264.00/unit, 258.50/unit

Option I: 265.50, 265.75/unit, 260.00/unit

Option J: 260.50, 260.75/unit, 250.00/unit

Wait, perhaps the first value is the price to achieve the old profit, the second for the new profit, and the third for something else. Or maybe the order is different.

Wait, the three questions are:

1) Can they achieve new profit within 5% price increase?

2) What sales price for new profit?

3) What sales price for old profit?

But the options have three prices. So perhaps the first is the 5% limit, the second the new profit price, and third the old profit price.

So for us:

- 5% limit is 262.5.

- New profit requires 261.75.

- Old profit requires 257.75.

Looking at the options, is there any that has 261.75 as the second value?

Option D: first value 262.5, second 261.75, third 255.

So our answers would be:

Q1: Yes (which is implied because 261.75 is below 262.5).

Q2: 261.75.

Q3: 257.75.

Looking at the options, none have 257.75 as the third value. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps when calculating the old profit objective (20% ROI), the costs are based on the original cost structure, not the increased variable costs. Because the old profit is based on their current setup, not the new plan.

Wait, no, because the problem says that to reach 20k units, they have to incur higher variable costs. So when they're selling 20k units, their costs are higher. So the old profit objective of $400k is based on the new cost structure.

Wait, but the old profit was when they were selling 17k units. Now, they're selling 20k with higher costs. So for the old profit, we have to compute based on the new costs.

Yes, that's correct. So the calculations I did earlier are correct.

Now, looking at the options, none of them have 257.75 as the third value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem.

Wait, let me check the calculations again for question 3.

Profit needed is $400k.

Total costs are 4,735k.

So revenue needed is 4,735k +400k =5,135k.

Price per unit is 5,135,000 /20,000 = 257.75.

Yes, correct.

Looking at the options, the closest third value is option B: 252.00, which is lower. Option H's third value is 258.50, which is higher than 257.75.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the total costs.

Let me recalculate total costs.

Manufacturing:

Fixed: 400k.

Variable: 20k units * (175+5)=20k*180=3,600k.

Total manufacturing: 400k +3,600k=4,000k.

Selling:

Fixed:135k.

Variable:20k*(25+5)=20k*30=600k.

Total selling: 135k +600k=735k.

Total costs:4,000k +735k=4,735k.

Yes, that's correct.

So price for 400k profit: 5,135k /20k=257.75.

Looking at the options, none have 257.75 as the third value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the third question refers to the old profit under the original cost structure, not the new one. Let me see.

The problem says: "What sales price would achieve the old profit objective?"

The old profit objective was 20% ROI, $400k. But originally, they were selling 17k units. So perhaps the third question is asking, under the new production level (20k units) but with the original cost structure, what price would achieve $400k profit.

Wait, but the problem states that to reach 20k units, they have to increase variable costs. So perhaps the old profit is calculated under the old cost structure.

Wait, the old profit was when selling 17k units, but now they are selling 20k. So perhaps the third question is, if they produce 20k units but keep the original variable costs, what price would achieve the old profit.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me read the problem again.

The old profit objective was 20% on $2M, which is $400k.

Now, with the new plan, they are selling 20k units, with increased variable costs. So the third question is, under the new plan (20k units, with increased variable costs), what price would achieve the old profit of $400k.

Which is exactly what I calculated: 257.75.

But since none of the options have 257.75, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the third question is asking, without increasing variable costs, what would the price be to achieve the old profit at 20k units.

In that case, the variable costs would
