Question:

Osgood is the record owner of Desertacre, a 100- acre tract of farmland in California's Coachella Valley. Osgood inherited the property from his father and farmed the land until 2006, when he reached the age of 70. He then decided to retire and move to Scottsdale, Arizona. At that time, Osgood conveyed Desertacre to Cutler "for his use during his natural life. "After taking possession of the property, Cutler executed a mortgage on Desertacre in the amount of $100,000. In 2009, Osgood died and in his will, the testator devised Desertacre to his son, Desmond, with remainder to Deirdre. The will provided that Desmond and Deirdre took Desertacre "subject to Cutler's mortgage. "At the time of Osgood's death, Desertacre had a market value of $300,000. When Desmond learned of the devise, he was hesitant about taking title to Desertacre because he did not want to incur any indebtedness. Assume that Culter is still alive and in possession of the tract. With respect to the mortgage, Desmond will be

Options:

A: liable, as he will inherit the property along with any attached liabilities.
B: liable for the mortgage, because the will did not explicitly exempt him from the debt.
C: not liable, because the mortgage is Cutler's responsibility as the life tenant.
D: liable for the mortgage, because he is the devisee under the terms of Osgood's will.
E: not liable, since the mortgage was not part of Osgood's original inheritance.
F: not liable, because there was no assumption of the mortgage.
G: not liable, because the mortgage was taken out after Osgood's conveyance to Cutler.
H: liable for the mortgage, because the property was devised subject to the mortgage.
I: not liable, because he did not personally grant the mortgage.
J: liable, because he is the direct descendant of the original property owner.

Okay, so I have this law question here about property and mortgages, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully.

So, Osgood owned Desertacre, which is a 100-acre farmland. He conveyed it to Cutler "for his use during his natural life." Oh wait, that sounds like a life estate. So Cutler gets to use the property for his life, and then what happens after that? Well, Osgood's will says that after his death, the property is devised to Desmond, his son, with a remainder to Deirdre. So Desmond gets it after Cutler's life estate ends, right?

In 2006, Osgood was 70 and retired. He conveyed the property to Cutler as a life estate. Then Cutler took out a mortgage for $100,000. Later, Osgood died in 2009, leaving the property to Desmond with the remainder to Deirdre. The will says they take it "subject to Cutler's mortgage." Now, the question is about Desmond's liability for the mortgage.

So, the options are A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about the concepts here.

I remember that when a life tenant takes out a mortgage, the general rule is that the life tenant is responsible for the mortgage. Because the life tenant has the right to use the property during their life, they are usually the ones liable for any debts attached to it. The remainderman, who gets the property after the life tenant dies, doesn't typically inherit the mortgage debt unless they agree to take it on.

Wait, but the will says Desmond takes it "subject to Cutler's mortgage." What does "subject to" mean here? I think "subject to" usually means that the grantee takes the property with the encumbrance, but it doesn't necessarily make them personally liable for the debt. So the property is encumbered, but Desmond isn't personally responsible for paying the mortgage unless he agreed to it.

So in this case, Cutler is the life tenant and took out the mortgage. As the life tenant, he's responsible for the mortgage during his life. The remainderman, Desmond, would only be liable if he assumes the mortgage, which he didn't do here. The will just says he takes it subject to the mortgage, meaning the mortgage stays on the property but Desmond isn't personally liable.

Looking at the options:

A: Desmond is liable because he inherits the property and liabilities. I don't think so because the life tenant is responsible, not the remainderman.

B: Liable because the will didn't exempt him. But "subject to" doesn't make him liable; it just means the mortgage exists.

C: Not liable because it's Cutler's responsibility. That sounds right because Cutler is the life tenant.

D: Liable because he's the devisee under the will. The will just gives him the property with a mortgage, not the liability.

E: Not liable because it wasn't part of Osgood's inheritance. Hmm, maybe, but the mortgage was taken after, so perhaps that's relevant, but the main point is about life tenant liability.

F: Not liable because he didn't assume the mortgage. That's correct because without assumption, he's not on the hook.

G: Not liable because the mortgage was after conveyance. This also makes sense. Osgood conveyed it, so the mortgage is Cutler's doing.

H: Liable because the property is subject to the mortgage. But being subject doesn't make him liable; it affects the property, not his personal liability.

I: Not liable because he didn't grant the mortgage. Correct, since Cutler did.

J: Liable because he's a descendant. No, that doesn't make sense.

So, the correct reasoning is that Cutler as the life tenant is responsible for the mortgage. Desmond, as the remainderman, isn't personally liable unless he assumed the debt, which he didn't. The will's "subject to" clause just means the mortgage remains on the property but doesn't impose personal liability on Desmond.

Looking at the options, option C says Desmond is not liable because it's Cutler's responsibility as the life tenant. Option F says he's not liable because there was no assumption. Both seem correct, but which is more precise?

In property law, the life tenant is responsible for the mortgage they take out. The remainderman doesn't inherit the liability. So the best answer is C or F. But wait, the question is about Desmond's liability. Since he didn't assume the mortgage, he isn't liable. So F is also a good option.

Wait, but the mortgage was placed by Cutler after he got the life estate. The general rule is that the life tenant can mortgage their interest, but that doesn't bind the remainderman. So the remainderman's interest is subject to the mortgage, but their liability is limited.

In this case, the mortgage is a lien on the property, but Desmond isn't personally liable. So when the question asks about liability, the answer would be that Desmond is not liable because Cutler is the life tenant responsible, so option C.

Alternatively, because he didn't assume the mortgage, option F is also correct. I think both C and F are possible, but which is the better answer.

Wait, option C is about Cutler's responsibility, which is accurate. Option F is about assumption, which is also correct. So which applies here?

In the scenario, the will says "subject to Cutler's mortgage," but that doesn't mean Desmond assumes it. So the key point is that the life tenant is liable for the mortgage, making option C correct.

But another thought: the mortgage was placed by Cutler, who has a life estate. The mortgage would typically be paid from the income of the property or by the life tenant. The remainderman isn't liable unless they take over the mortgage.

So I think the correct answer is C: not liable because it's Cutler's responsibility as the life tenant.

Wait, but another angle: when a life tenant mortgages the property, does it affect the remainderman? The mortgage is a lien on the property, but the remainderman isn't personally liable. So the property might be sold to satisfy the mortgage, but Desmond isn't personally on the hook.

So in terms of liability, Desmond isn't liable; the mortgage is Cutler's responsibility. So the answer would be C.

Alternatively, option F says he's not liable because he didn't assume the mortgage, which is also correct, but perhaps C is more precise.

I'm a bit torn between C and F. Let me think again. The question is about liability for the mortgage. The life tenant is responsible, and the remainderman isn't unless they assume it. So the correct answer is C.

The question revolves around the liability of Desmond for a mortgage on Desertacre, a property conveyed by Osgood to Cutler for life, with the remainder to Desmond and Deirdre. The key issue is whether Desmond, as the remainderman, is personally liable for the mortgage taken out by Cutler, the life tenant.

Under property law, a life tenant (Cutler) is generally responsible for debts or mortgages they incur during their life tenancy. The remainderman (Desmond) is not personally liable for such debts unless they explicitly assume the mortgage. The will states that Desmond takes the property "subject to Cutler's mortgage," which means the property is encumbered by the mortgage but does not impose personal liability on Desmond. The liability remains with Cutler, the life tenant, who is responsible for satisfying the mortgage during his lifetime.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, D, H, J**: These options incorrectly suggest that Desmond is liable for the mortgage. Desmond does not inherit personal liability for the mortgage simply by taking the property or because the will mentions it.
- **E, G**: While these options touch on the timing of the mortgage, they do not address the core issue of liability. The mortgage being taken after Osgood's conveyance does not affect Desmond's lack of liability.
- **C**: This correctly states that Desmond is not liable because the mortgage is Cutler's responsibility as the life tenant. This aligns with the principle that the life tenant is responsible for debts incurred during their tenancy.
- **F**: This also correctly states that Desmond is not liable because he did not assume the mortgage. However, the more precise reasoning is that liability falls on the life tenant, making **C** the better answer.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as it accurately reflects the principle that the life tenant (Cutler) is responsible for the mortgage, and Desmond, as the remainderman, is not personally liable. 

Answer: C
