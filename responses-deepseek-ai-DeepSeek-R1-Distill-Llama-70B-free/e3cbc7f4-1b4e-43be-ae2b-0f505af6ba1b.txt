Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that each time Rami turned the dial on a machine, the dial moved 1 degree. Then Rami turned the dial 10 times. I need to find out the total number of degrees the dial moved. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, so each turn is 1 degree. And he did this 10 times. So I think I need to multiply the number of turns by the degrees per turn. That makes sense because each turn adds 1 degree, so 10 turns would add 10 degrees in total.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Sometimes these problems have tricks, but this one seems straightforward. It says each time he turned it, it moved 1 degree. So each turn is 1 degree. So 10 turns would be 10 degrees total.

Looking at the options, I see option I is 10. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check the options to make sure I didn't misread any numbers.

Option A is 270, which seems way too high. Option B is 100, also higher than 10. Option C is 90, which is still bigger. D is 20, E is 110, F is 45, G is 720, H is 180, I is 10, and J is 360. Yep, I is 10, which matches my calculation.

So I'm confident the answer is I.

The total degrees the dial moved is 10, as each of the 10 turns moved it by 1 degree.
