Okay, so I've got this question here asking about the second most common element in the solar system. Hmm, I remember that the solar system is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think through this step by step.

First, what's the most abundant element? I've learned before that hydrogen is the lightest and most common element, right? So hydrogen would be number one. That would mean the second most common is probably helium because I remember that stars primarily fuse hydrogen into helium. So the solar system's composition should reflect that.

Wait, but wait. Sometimes people get confused between the composition of the Sun and the entire solar system. The Sun is mostly hydrogen and helium, but does that apply to the whole solar system including planets and other objects? I think the solar system as a whole has the same basic composition because the Sun is so massive compared to the planets. So the Sun's elements would dominate the overall abundance.

So if hydrogen is first, then helium must be second. Let me think about the options again. The options are A to J. Looking at the choices, option E is Hydrogen, F is Helium. So the question is asking for the second most common, which would be Helium. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but could I be mixing this up? Maybe I should think about the elements beyond the Sun. Like, in the planets, oxygen, silicon, iron are more common. But the solar system is mostly the Sun. So the planets contribute much less mass. So the Sun's composition dictates the solar system's. Therefore, the order is Hydrogen first, Helium second.

So I'm confident the answer is F: Helium.

The second most common element in the solar system is helium. Since the Sun is the most massive object in the solar system and primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, these two elements dominate the solar system's elemental abundance. Hydrogen is the most abundant, followed by helium.
