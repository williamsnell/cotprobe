Okay, so I have this physics problem here about Young's Modulus and calculating the force needed to stretch a steel wire. Let me try to understand what's being asked and figure it out step by step. 

Alright, Young's Modulus (Y) is given as 19 × 10^11 dynes/cm². The wire has a cross-sectional area of 1 square millimeter, and it's supposed to be stretched by 0.2% of its original length. I need to find the force required to do this.

Hmm, I remember that Young's Modulus relates stress and strain. The formula is Y = stress/strain. Stress is force per unit area, and strain is the fractional change in length, which is (change in length)/(original length). 

So, rearranging the formula to solve for force, which is F = Y * strain * area. That makes sense because stress is F/A, so F = Y * strain * A.

Wait, let's break down the units. Oh, right, Young's Modulus is in dynes/cm². The area here is given in square millimeters. I need to make sure the units are consistent. Since 1 cm is 10 mm, 1 cm² is (10 mm)^2, which is 100 mm². So 1 mm² is 1/100 cm², or 0.01 cm².

The cross-sectional area is 1 mm², which equals 0.01 cm². 

The strain is 0.2%, which is 0.002 in decimal form. So strain = 0.002.

Putting it all into the formula: F = Y * strain * area. 

So Y is 19e11 dynes/cm². Strain is 0.002. Area is 0.01 cm². 

Calculating that: F = 19e11 * 0.002 * 0.01.

Let me compute this step by step. First, 19e11 multiplied by 0.002. 19 * 0.002 is 0.038, and then multiplied by 1e11 gives 3.8e9. Then multiply by 0.01 (which is 1e-2), so 3.8e9 * 1e-2 is 3.8e7. Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my math again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let's redo this.

19e11 * 0.002 = (19 * 0.002) * 1e11. 19 * 0.002 is 0.038. So 0.038e11. Then, multiply by 0.01 (which is 1e-2), so 0.038e11 * 0.01 = 0.038 * 1e9 * 1e-2. Oh wait, 1e11 * 1e-2 is 1e9. So 0.038 * 1e9 = 3.8e7. So F is 3.8e7 dynes.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, they're all in the range of 15e8 to 23e8. So I must have messed up somewhere. Oh no, where did I go wrong?

Oh wait, maybe I messed up the conversion of mm to cm. Let me double-check that. The area is 1 mm², which is (0.1 cm)^2 = 0.01 cm², right? Yes. So that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the multiplication steps are wrong. Let me recalculate:

Young's Modulus Y = 19e11 dynes/cm².

Strain (e) = 0.2% = 0.002.

Area (A) = 1 mm² = 0.01 cm².

So F = Y * e * A.

Plugging in the numbers: F = 19e11 * 0.002 * 0.01.

Compute 0.002 * 0.01 first. That's 2e-3 * 1e-2 = 2e-5.

So 19e11 * 2e-5.

Multiplying 19 and 2 gives 38. 1e11 * 1e-5 is 1e6.

So 38e6, which is 3.8e7. Wait, that's 38,000,000 dynes. But the options are all around 1e9, like 15e8 is 1.5e9, so why am I getting 3.8e7?

Hmm, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me re-express 19e11. Oh wait, 19e11 is 1.9e12? Wait, no, 19e11 is 19 * 1e11, which is 1.9e12? No, wait 10^11 is 1e11, 19e11 is 1.9e12? Wait, no, 19e11 is 19 followed by 11 zeros, which is 1.9e12. Oh, wait no! 19e11 is 19 multiplied by 10^11, which is 1.9e12. Oh, I think I made a mistake in handling the exponents earlier.

Wait, let me clarify: 19e11 is 19 * 10^11 = 1.9 * 10^12. So when I do 1.9e12 * 0.002 * 0.01.

So 0.002 is 2e-3, 0.01 is 1e-2. So 2e-3 * 1e-2 = 2e-5.

So 1.9e12 * 2e-5 = (1.9 * 2) * (1e12 * 1e-5) )= 3.8 * 1e7. So 3.8e7 dynes.

Wait, that's 38 million dynes. But the options are in the 1e9 range. Did I miscalculate the exponent?

Wait another thought: perhaps the cross-sectional area is 1 square mm, which is 1e-6 m², but wait no, the question uses cgs units (dynes and cm). So 1 mm is 0.1 cm. So 1 mm² is (0.1 cm)^2 = 0.01 cm², which I think I did correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Compute 19e11 * 0.002 = ?

19e11 is 1.9e12. 0.002 is 2e-3.

1.9e12 * 2e-3 = (1.9 *2) * (1e12 * 1e-3) )= 3.8 * 1e9 = 3.8e9.

Then multiply by 0.01 (1e-2):

3.8e9 * 0.01 = 3.8e7.

So again, 3.8e7 dynes. But the options are much higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I forgot to convert something else. Let me double-check the original values.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Oh wait, no, Young's modulus Y = (F/A)/(ΔL/L) → F = Y * A * (ΔL/L).

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the area is 1 mm², which is 1e-6 m², but in cgs units, 1 cm² is 1e-4 m². Wait, no, the units here are all in cm. So 1 mm² = (0.1 cm)^2 = 0.01 cm².

So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe the calculation is correct and the options are wrong, but I doubt that. Let me see if I made a miscalculation in exponents.

Wait, 19e11 is 19 * 1e11 = 1.9e12.

Multiply by 0.002 → 1.9e12 * 2e-3 = 3.8e9.

Multiply by 0.01 → 3.8e9 * 1e-2 = 3.8e7.

Hmm, I'm getting 3.8e7, which is 38 million dynes.

But looking at the options, the closest is not present. Let me check the options again. The options are in 1e8 range, such as 15e8, 16e8, up to 23e8.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me re-express 19e11 as 1.9e12.

Wait, 19e11 is the same as 1.9e12? No, wait! 19e11 is 19 * 10^11, which is 1.9 * 10^12. So yeah.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that 1e11 is 10^11. So when I multiply 19e11 by 0.002 and 0.01:

Let me compute 19e11 * 0.002 = 19 * 1e11 * 2e-3 = 38 * 1e8 = 3.8e9.

Then 3.8e9 * 0.01 = 3.8e7.

Wait, same result. So perhaps I'm missing a step here.

Another thought: Maybe the strain is 0.2%, which is 0.002, but perhaps I should express it differently. Or perhaps the area is 1 mm², which is 0.1 cm in each dimension. Wait, no, 1 mm is 0.1 cm, so 1 mm² is (0.1 cm)^2 is 0.01 cm². That's correct.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute the force using the formula F = Y * (ΔL / L) * A.

ΔL / L is 0.002.

A is 1 mm² = 0.01 cm².

So F = 19e11 dyn/cm² * 0.002 * 0.01 cm².

Compute 19e11 * 0.002 = 19 * 0.002 * 1e11 = 0.038 * 1e11 = 3.8e9.

Then multiply by 0.01 cm²: 3.8e9 * 0.01 = 3.8e7 dynes.

Hmm, same result again. So 3.8e7, which is 38,000,000 dynes. But the options are all higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the exponents. Let me try calculating 19e11 * 0.002 * 0.01.

19e11 = 19 * 10^11.

Multiply by 0.002: 19 * 0.002 = 0.038.

So 0.038 * 10^11 = 3.8 * 10^9.

Then multiply by 0.01: 3.8e9 * 0.01 = 3.8e7.

No mistake here. So why am I not matching the options?

Wait, maybe the cross-sectional area is 1 square millimeter, but perhaps I should convert it to cm² correctly. Wait, 1 mm is 0.1 cm. So 1 mm² is 0.1 cm * 0.1 cm = 0.01 cm². So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the original length is needed? Wait, no, because in the formula, it's (ΔL/L), so the actual length cancels out. So the length doesn't matter here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the units for Young's Modulus. The question says 19 × 10^11 dynes/cm². So that's correct.

Hmm, I'm confused. Because according to my calculations, the answer is 3.8e7 dynes, but none of the options match this. So maybe I made an error in the formula.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps I should be using stress = Y * strain, and stress is force per area. So F = stress * area = Y * strain * area. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should convert the area from mm² to cm² correctly. Wait, 1 cm² is 100 mm², so 1 mm² is 0.01 cm². Correct.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the multiplication order. Let me compute 19e11 * 0.002 * 0.01.

19 * 0.002 is 0.038. 0.038 * 0.01 is 0.00038. Then multiply by 1e11.

Wait, 0.00038 * 1e11 = 3.8e7. Same result again.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the area in different units. Let me try converting it to m², but I don't think that's the case since the modulus is given in cm².

Wait, perhaps I should re-express 0.002 as 2e-3 and 0.01 as 1e-2.

So 19e11 * 2e-3 = 19 * 2 * 1e8 = 38e8.

Wait, 19e11 is 1.9e12, 2e-3 is 0.002.

So 1.9e12 * 0.002 = 3.8e9.

Then multiply by 1e-2, gives 3.8e7.

Wait, that's what I did before.

Wait, perhaps I should have used area in mm² without converting. Let's try that.

F = Y * strain * area.

But Y is in dyn/cm², area in mm². So to have consistent units, I need to convert area to cm². So 1 mm² is 0.01 cm².

Alternatively, perhaps I can convert Y to dyn/mm².

Wait, 1 cm² = (10 mm)^2 = 100 mm². So 1 mm² = 0.01 cm². So Y in dyn/mm² would be 19e11 dyn/cm² * 100 mm²/cm². Because 1 cm² is 100 mm², so 1 dyn/cm² is 100 dyn/mm².

So Y in mm² units is 19e11 * 100 = 1.9e13 dyn/mm².

Then, F = Y * strain * area.

Y is 1.9e13 dyn/mm².

Strain is 0.002.

Area is 1 mm².

So F = 1.9e13 * 0.002 * 1.

Compute 1.9e13 * 0.002 = 3.8e10.

Wait, that's 3.8e10 dynes, which is 38,000,000,000 dynes. That's way higher than any of the options.

Hmm, but that's not matching either. So I'm getting confused. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me just write down all the steps clearly.

Given:

Y = 19e11 dyn/cm²

Strain (e) = 0.002 (since 0.2% = 0.002)

Area (A) = 1 mm² = 0.01 cm².

Formula: F = Y * e * A.

So F = 19e11 * 0.002 * 0.01.

Compute 19e11 * 0.002: 19 * 0.002 = 0.038; 0.038e11 = 3.8e9.

Then multiply by 0.01: 3.8e9 * 0.01 = 3.8e7.

Wait, so 3.8e7 dynes is 3.8 × 10^7 dynes, which is 38 million dynes.

Looking at the options:

A:22e8 → 2.2e9
B:14e8 →1.4e9
C:23e8 →2.3e9
D:21e8 →2.1e9
E:16e8 →1.6e9
F:19e8 →1.9e9
G:18e8 →1.8e9
H:20e8 →2.0e9
I:17e8 →1.7e9
J:15e8 →1.5e9

Hmm, none of the options match 3.8e7. So I must be missing something. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the 0.2% is a change in length, but perhaps the formula expects the strain to be unitless. Oh, no, that's fine. 0.2% is 0.002 as a decimal, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the area to cm² incorrectly. Let me check again.

1 mm is 0.1 cm. So 1 mm² is (0.1 cm)^2 = 0.01 cm². So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use 1 cm² = 100 mm², so 1 mm² = 0.01 cm². Correct.

Wait, maybe the formula uses stress as F/A, and Y is stress/strain, so F = Y * strain * A.

Yes, that's correct. So F = Y * (ΔL/L) * A.

Putting it in numbers again:

Y = 19e11 dyn/cm².

ΔL/L = 0.002.

A = 0.01 cm².

So F = 19e11 * 0.002 * 0.01.

19e11 is 1.9e12.

1.9e12 * 0.002 = 3.8e9.

3.8e9 * 0.01 = 3.8e7.

I don't see where I'm going wrong here. Unless the correct answer isn't among the options, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me try to compute it differently.

Compute 19e11 * 0.002 = ?

19e11 = 19 × 10^11.

0.002 = 2 × 10^-3.

So 19 × 2 = 38.

10^11 × 10^-3 = 10^8.

So 38 × 10^8 → 3.8 × 10^9.

Then multiply by 0.01 (1e-2):

3.8e9 × 1e-2 = 3.8e7.

Same result again
