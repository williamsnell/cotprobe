Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because buffer solutions can be a bit tricky for me. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution that's a mixture of HOAc and NaOAc. So, I remember that HOAc is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. NaOAc is sodium acetate, which is the sodium salt of acetic acid, so it's the conjugate base. That means this solution is a buffer solution because it contains a weak acid and its conjugate base.

The data given: the concentration of HOAc is 0.10 M, and the concentration of NaOAc is 0.20 M. The dissociation constant (Ka) for HOAc is 1.75 × 10^-5. I need to find the pH of this solution.

I remember the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is used for buffer solutions. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]), where [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base (from NaOAc) and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid (HOAc).

So first, I need to calculate pKa. Since Ka is given as 1.75e-5, pKa is the negative logarithm of that. Let me compute that. 

Hmm, taking the log of 1.75e-5. I know that log(1.75) is approximately 0.243 because log(1)=0, log(1.7)=0.23, so maybe around 0.24. So log(1.75e-5) would be log(1.75) + log(1e-5). Log(1e-5) is -5, so pKa is about -(0.243 -5) = 4.757? Wait, no, wait. Wait. Let me recalculate. Ka is 1.75e-5, so log(1.75e-5) is log(1.75) + log(1e-5). Log(1e-5) is -5, and log(1.75) is about 0.243. So log(Ka) is 0.243 -5 = -4.757. Therefore, pKa is 4.757. So approximately 4.76.

Now, applying the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). Here, [A-] is 0.20 M (from NaOAc) and [HA] is 0.10 M (HOAc). So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.20 / 0.10 = 2.

So log(2) is about 0.301. Adding that to pKa: 4.757 + 0.301 = 5.058. So pH is approximately 5.06.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.07, which is very close to my calculation. But wait, maybe I should calculate pKa more accurately. Let me think: 1.75e-5. Let me compute log(1.75) more precisely.

I remember that log(1.6) is 0.204, log(1.7)=0.230, log(1.75) is about 0.2430. So yes, pKa is 4.743 (since log(1.75e-5)= log(1.75)+log(1e-5)=0.243 + (-5) = -4.757, so pKa is 4.757).

So the calculation gives pH = 4.757 + 0.301 = 5.058. So about 5.06, which matches option C (5.07). But wait, what if I did that wrong?

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula without Henderson-Hasselbalch. Let me try that approach to verify.

The buffer equation comes from the dissociation of acetic acid: HOAc ⇌ H+ + OAc^-. The presence of OAc^- (from NaOAc) shifts the equilibrium, but for the purpose of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we can assume that the concentrations of HOAc and OAc^- are approximately 0.10 M and 0.20 M, respectively, because the amount of H+ produced is negligible compared to the initial concentrations.

So using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is correct here. So the pH should be around 5.06, so the closest option is C:5.07.

Wait, but wait another thing. Could there be any activity coefficients or anything else? No, I think the problem assumes ideal behavior, so no need to adjust.

So I think the correct answer is option C:5.07.
</think>

To determine the pH of the buffer solution containing 0.10 M HOAc (acetic acid) and 0.20 M NaOAc (sodium acetate), we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Calculate pKa
The dissociation constant \( K_a \) of acetic acid is given as \( 1.75 \times 10^{-5} \). The pKa is calculated as:

\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(K_a) = -\log(1.75 \times 10^{-5})
\]

Breaking this down:
\[
\log(1.75 \times 10^{-5}) = \log(1.75) + \log(10^{-5}) = 0.243 - 5 = -4.757
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{pKa} = 4.757
\]

### Step 2: Apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation
The concentrations of the conjugate base \([\text{A}^-]\) and the weak acid \([\text{HA}]\) are 0.20 M and 0.10 M, respectively. Substituting these values into the equation:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.757 + \log\left(\frac{0.20}{0.10}\right)
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.20}{0.10} = 2\), and \(\log(2) \approx 0.301\). Therefore:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.757 + 0.301 = 5.058
\]

### Step 3: Match the Closest Option
The calculated pH is approximately 5.06, which is closest to option **C: 5.07**.

### Final Answer:
