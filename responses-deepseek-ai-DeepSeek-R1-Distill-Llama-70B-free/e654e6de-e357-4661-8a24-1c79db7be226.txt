Question:

What is meant by regeneration? Explain regeneration by usingplanariaas an example.

Options:

A: Regeneration is the ability to change color to blend with the environment
B: Regeneration is the ability of Planaria to grow larger by consuming more food
C: Regeneration involves the spontaneous generation of new organisms from non-living matter
D: Regeneration is the repair of lost or injured parts and in Planaria, if a part is cut off, it will regenerate into a whole worm
E: Regeneration is the process of aging reversal
F: Regeneration is the migration of Planaria to new environments to grow new populations
G: Regeneration refers to the ability to grow a new organism from a single cell
H: Regeneration is the process where an organism replicates its DNA to heal wounds
I: Regeneration is the ability of Planaria to reproduce asexually by splitting into two
J: Regeneration is the enhancement of sensory capabilities in Planaria after injury

Okay, I've got this question about regeneration, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, I remember that regeneration has something to do with healing or growing back parts of an organism. Let me think about what each option says.

The question asks what regeneration means and to explain it using Planaria as an example. I've heard that Planaria are flatworms known for their ability to regenerate. So if you cut them into pieces, each piece can grow into a whole new worm. That's pretty cool.

Looking at the options, option D says regeneration is the repair of lost or injured parts, and for Planaria, if a part is cut off, it regenerates into a whole worm. That sounds exactly like what I remember. Planaria have stem cells called neoblasts that can differentiate into any cell type, allowing them to regenerate lost body parts.

Wait, what about the other options? Option A is about changing color, which I think is more like camouflage, maybe in animals like chameleons. Not related to regeneration.

Option B talks about growing larger by eating more. That's just general growth, not regeneration. So B is probably wrong.

Option C mentions spontaneous generation from non-living matter. That's an old theory that's been disproven, so C isn't correct.

Option E is about aging reversal, which doesn't fit. Regeneration is about healing, not reversing age.

Option F is migration, which is about moving to new places. Not related to regrowing body parts.

Option G says growing a new organism from a single cell. That could be part of regeneration, but the option says "from a single cell," which might be more about reproduction than regeneration. Plus, Planaria can regenerate from parts, not just single cells, I think.

Option H is about DNA replication healing wounds. While DNA repair is a part of healing, this doesn't capture the full idea of regeneration, especially the growing of entire structures.

Option I mentions asexual reproduction by splitting. That's more about how some organisms reproduce, like binary fission in bacteria or in some worms. But regeneration is about repairing, not reproducing.

Option J is about enhancing senses after injury. That doesn't sound right either.

So the best fit is option D. It correctly describes regeneration as repairing lost parts and gives the Planaria example accurately.

Regeneration refers to the ability of an organism to repair or regrow lost or injured body parts. Planaria, a type of flatworm, exemplifies this process. When injured or even cut into pieces, Planaria can regenerate the missing parts, including entire organs, due to the presence of stem cells called neoblasts. These cells can differentiate into any type of cell needed, allowing the worm to fully restore itself.

Option D accurately describes this process, making it the correct choice.

Answer: D
