Question:

Consider the trial on which a 3 is first observed in successive rolls of a six-sided die. Let $A$ be the event that 3 is observed on the first trial. Let $B$ be the event that at least two trials are required to observe a 3 . Assuming that each side has probability $1 / 6$, find (a) $P(A)$.


Options:

A: $\frac{3}{6}$
B: $\frac{1}{3}$
C: $\frac{1}{12}$
D: $\frac{4}{6}$
E: $\frac{2}{6}$
F: $\frac{1}{6}$
G: $\frac{1}{2}$
H: $\frac{1}{36}$
I: $\frac{5}{36}$
J: $\frac{5}{6}$

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this probability question. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about rolling a six-sided die repeatedly until a 3 appears. They define two events: A is when a 3 is observed on the first trial. B is when at least two trials are needed to get a 3. The first part asks for P(A), the probability that event A happens.

I remember that each face of a die has an equal probability of 1/6. So, when you roll the die once, the chance of getting any specific number, like 3, should be 1 divided by 6, right? Because there's only one 3 out of six possible outcomes.

Wait, so P(A) is just the probability that the first roll is a 3. That makes sense. So each trial is independent, and each has the same probability of success, which here is getting a 3.

Hmm, are there any tricky parts here? Like, do I need to consider more than one roll for part (a)? No, because event A is specifically about the first trial. So I don't think so. It's straightforward.

Let me think about the possible options. The options are given as A to J. Looking at the options, F is 1/6. So that should be the correct answer for P(A). But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything.

Another way to think about it: the probability of getting a 3 on a single roll is 1/6. Since event A is exactly that, P(A) is 1/6. So yeah, that's definitely F.

I don't see any other factors here. It's a simple probability question, and I'm confident the answer is F.

The problem involves rolling a six-sided die until a 3 appears. Event \( A \) is defined as observing a 3 on the first trial. Since each face of the die has an equal probability of \( \frac{1}{6} \), the probability of rolling a 3 on the first trial is simply \( \frac{1}{6} \). This is because there is only one favorable outcome (rolling a 3) out of six possible outcomes. 

Given that event \( A \) is limited to the first trial, there are no additional complexities or considerations required. The probability \( P(A) \) is therefore \( \frac{1}{6} \).

The correct answer is **F**.
