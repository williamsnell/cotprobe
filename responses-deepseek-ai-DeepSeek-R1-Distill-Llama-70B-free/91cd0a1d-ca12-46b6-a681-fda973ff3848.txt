Okay, so I've got this problem about pricing an asset-or-nothing put option using the Black-Scholes model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, first, let's understand what an asset-or-nothing put option is. From what I remember, an asset-or-nothing put option pays the holder the value of the underlying asset if the option is in-the-money at expiration. So, if the option expires in-the-money (which for a put means the stock price is below the strike), the holder gets the asset's value. Otherwise, they get nothing.

Wait, but wait. In this case, the problem says the payoff is made only if the equity index fund is down by more than 40% at the end of one year. So that means the option will be exercised (payoff received) only if the index drops below a certain level. Let me compute what that level is.

The current index level is 1000. A 40% drop would mean the index is at 1000 * (1 - 0.4) = 600. So the strike price must be 600? Because if the index is below 600 at expiration, the option pays off. Wait, wait, no. Wait, in a put option, if the spot price is below the strike, the put is in-the-money. So the strike here must be 600 because the index needs to be below 600 for the option to pay off.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says the payoff is made only if the fund is down by more than 40%. So that's when the index is less than 600. So the strike price K is 600. Because at expiration, if S < K, the put is in-the-money, so the holder gets the asset (the index fund) in exchange for the strike. Wait no, wait, for an asset-or-nothing put, the payoff is the asset itself. So when S < K, the payoff is S, not the usual put payoff of (K - S). Or wait, no, I might be confusing with cash-or-nothing puts. Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, a standard put option gives the holder (K - S) when S < K. But an asset-or-nothing put gives the holder the asset (so S) if S < K, otherwise zero. Wait, no, that can't be right because if you have a put, you're bearish. So if S is below K, the put is in the money, meaning the holder would want to exercise it. But for an asset-or-nothing put, the payoff is the asset's value, so if S < K, then the payoff is S? Or is it that the holder gives up the asset and gets K in return?

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think: in a put option, the holder has the right to sell the asset at the strike price. So for a standard put, the payoff is max(K - S, 0). But for an asset-or-nothing put, I think the payoff is S if S <= K, else zero. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because if S is lower than K, the put is in-the-money, so the holder would choose to exercise. But in an asset-or-nothing put, the payoff is the underlying asset if the option is in-the-money, else nothing. Wait, no, that can't be because if the option is in-the-money (S < K), then the holder would receive the asset, which is S. So the payoff would be S if S <= K, else zero. But that seems a bit strange because S could be very low, so the option's value would be the value of S at expiration, but only if it's below K. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, perhaps I should check the formula.

Wait, according to what I remember, an asset-or-nothing put option's payoff is S_T if S_T <= K, else zero. Alternatively, it's the asset itself. But I think it's more accurate to say that it's the value of the asset if it's below the strike, else nothing. So, the payoff is S_T * I_{S_T <= K}, where I is an indicator function.

But wait, Black-Scholes model is usually for European options, and the formula for such exotic options might require some adjustment. Alternatively, perhaps we can think of it as a binary option, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model it using the Black-Scholes formula for a standard put and then adjust it. Wait, but no, because the standard put's payoff is (K - S), while this is S if S < K.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the asset-or-nothing put as a combination of other options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as follows: The value of the asset-or-nothing put is equal to S * Prob(S_T <= K) under the appropriate measure. Wait, but in Black-Scholes, we have risk-neutral valuation, so it's the expected value under the risk-neutral measure.

Wait, but more accurately, the value of the option is the discounted expected payoff under the risk-neutral measure. So for an asset-or-nothing put, the payoff at time T is S_T if S_T <= K, else 0. So the present value would be e^(-rT) times the expected value of S_T * I_{S_T <= K} under the risk-neutral measure.

Hmm, but how do I compute that expectation? Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for this.

Wait, I remember that the formula for a binary (or digital) put option is similar. A binary put pays a fixed amount if S_T < K. But in this case, it's paying S_T if S_T < K. So it's a bit different.

Wait, perhaps I can find an expression for E[S_T | S_T <= K] multiplied by the probability that S_T <= K, then discount it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express it as S_0 * e^{(b - r)T} * N(d1) - K * e^{-rT} * N(d2), but I'm not sure. Wait, that's the formula for a standard call option. Wait, no, the standard European call is S_0 * N(d1) - K e^{-rT} N(d2).

Wait, perhaps I should first consider the risk-neutral dynamics. Under the Black-Scholes model, the stock price follows dS = (r - q) S dt + σ S dW, where q is the dividend yield. Oh wait, the problem says the dividend yield is 2%, so q = 0.02. So the drift is (r - q) = 2.5% - 2% = 0.5% or 0.005.

Wait, so the risk-neutral process is dS = (r - q) S dt + σ S dW, which would make S a martingale under the risk-neutral measure.

Now, the payoff is S_T if S_T <= K, else 0. So the value of the option is e^{-rT} E[S_T I_{S_T <= K}].

Hmm, to compute this expectation, I can use the Black-Scholes formula for this particular payoff. Alternatively, I can think of it as a put option with a different payoff structure.

Wait, perhaps I can look up the formula for an asset-or-nothing put. Alternatively, I can derive it. Let me try to recall or derive it.

The value of the asset-or-nothing put can be expressed as:

Put = S_0 * e^{-qT} * N(-d1) - K e^{-rT} * N(-d2)

Wait, no, that's the formula for a standard put option. But in our case, the payoff is different. So I think I need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is similar to a standard put, but with some modifications. Let me think: for a standard put, the value is K e^{-rT} N(-d2) - S_0 e^{-qT} N(-d1). So if I can find a way to adjust this for the asset-or-nothing payoff.

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute the expectation more directly. Let's consider that under the risk-neutral measure, the stock price at time T is lognormally distributed with parameters (r - q - σ²/2)T and σ² T.

So, the expectation E[S_T I_{S_T <= K}] is the integral from 0 to K of S_T * f(S_T) dS_T, where f(S_T) is the lognormal density.

The lognormal density is f(S_T) = (1/(S_T σ sqrt(2π T))) exp( - ( (ln(S_T/S_0) - (r - q - σ²/2) T )² ) / (2 σ² T) ) )

So, the integral becomes ∫ from 0 to K S_T * f(S_T) dS_T.

Let me make a substitution. Let x = ln(S_T) - (r - q - σ²/2) T. Then, S_T = S_0 exp( x + (r - q - σ²/2) T ) = S_0 exp( (r - q) T - σ² T / 2 + x )

Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps a change of variable to y = ln(S_T) would help. Let me set y = ln(S_T), so S_T = e^y. Then, the integral becomes ∫ from -infty to ln(K) e^y * f(y) dy, where f(y) is the normal density with mean (r - q - σ²/2) T and variance σ² T.

So, f(y) = (1/(σ sqrt(2π T))) exp( - (y - (r - q - σ²/2) T )² / (2 σ² T) )

So, the integral becomes ∫ from -infty to ln(K) e^y * (1/(σ sqrt(2π T))) exp( - (y - μ)^2 / (2 σ² T) ) dy, where μ = (r - q - σ²/2) T.

Let me compute this integral. Let me note that e^y multiplied by the normal density. Hmm, perhaps completing the square or some other technique.

Let me rewrite the exponent:

- (y - μ)^2 / (2 σ² T) + y = [ - (y² - 2 μ y + μ²) ] / (2 σ² T) + y

= [ - y² + 2 μ y - μ² ] / (2 σ² T) + y

= [ - y² + (2 μ + 2 σ² T) y - μ² ] / (2 σ² T )

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as a new normal distribution.

Wait, the integral is E[e^y I_{y <= ln K}], since y = ln S_T. So E[e^y I_{y <= ln K}] = e^{μ + (σ² T)/2} * P(y' <= ln K - (μ + σ² T / 2)), where y' is a standard normal variable.

Wait, that might be a way. Let me think. Because if I let y = μ + σ sqrt(T) z, where z is standard normal, then e^y = e^{μ + σ sqrt(T) z}.

Wait, so E[e^y I_{y <= ln K}] = e^{μ} E[ e^{σ sqrt(T) z} I_{σ sqrt(T) z <= ln K - μ} } ]

= e^{μ} e^{(σ² T)/2} E[ e^{σ sqrt(T) z - (σ² T)/2} I_{z <= (ln K - μ)/(σ sqrt(T))} } ]

Wait, because e^{a z - a²/2} is the moment generating function of z under a change of measure, but maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can adjust the integral as follows:

E[e^y I_{y <= a}] where a = ln K.

Let me denote a = ln K.

Then, E[e^y I_{y <= a}] = ∫_{-infty}^a e^y f(y) dy, where f(y) is the normal density with mean μ and variance σ² T.

Let me make a substitution: let z = (y - μ) / (σ sqrt(T)), so y = μ + σ sqrt(T) z. Then dy = σ sqrt(T) dz.

So, the integral becomes:

∫_{-infty}^{(a - μ)/(σ sqrt(T))} e^{μ + σ sqrt(T) z} * (1/(σ sqrt(T) sqrt(2π))) e^{-z² / 2} } * σ sqrt(T) dz

Simplify:

= e^{μ} ∫_{-infty}^{d} e^{σ sqrt(T) z} * (1/ sqrt(2π)) e^{-z² / 2} dz,

where d = (a - μ)/(σ sqrt(T)).

This integral is e^{μ} * e^{(σ² T)/2} ∫_{-infty}^d e^{- (z - σ sqrt(T))² / 2 } * (1/sqrt(2π)) dz.

Wait, because when you multiply e^{σ sqrt(T) z} and e^{-z²/2}, you can complete the square.

Let me expand the exponent:

σ sqrt(T) z - z²/2 = -(z² - 2 σ sqrt(T) z ) / 2

= -(z² - 2 σ sqrt(T) z + σ² T - σ² T ) / 2

= -( (z - σ sqrt(T))^2 - σ² T ) / 2

= - (z - σ sqrt(T))^2 / 2 + σ² T / 2

So, e^{σ sqrt(T) z - z²/2} = e^{σ² T / 2} e^{ - (z - σ sqrt(T))² / 2 }

So, plugging this back into the integral:

e^{μ} * e^{σ² T / 2} ∫_{-infty}^d e^{- (z - σ sqrt(T))² / 2} * (1/sqrt(2π)) dz

But the integral is the cumulative distribution function for a normal variable with mean σ sqrt(T) up to d. So,

= e^{μ + σ² T / 2} * N( (d - σ sqrt(T)) / 1 )

Wait, because the integral of the normal PDF from -infty to d, with mean σ sqrt(T), is N( (d - σ sqrt(T)) / 1 ), since the standard normal is mean 0, variance 1.

Wait, let me make sure. Let me denote the variable inside the integral as z', where z' = z - σ sqrt(T). Then, when z = d, z' = d - σ sqrt(T). So the integral becomes N(d - σ sqrt(T)).

Wait, so the expectation becomes:

E[e^y I_{y <= a}] = e^{μ + σ² T / 2} * N(d - σ sqrt(T)), 

where d = (a - μ)/(σ sqrt(T)).

Wait, let me check the substitutions again to make sure.

Wait, a = ln K.

μ = (r - q - σ²/2) T.

So, d = (a - μ) / (σ sqrt(T)) = [ln K - (r - q - σ²/2) T ] / (σ sqrt(T)).

And then, the expectation is e^{μ + σ² T / 2} * N( d - σ sqrt(T) ).

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me compute this carefully.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me try again.

After substitution, we have:

E[e^y I_{y <= a}] = e^{μ} * e^{σ² T / 2} * ∫_{-infty}^d e^{- (z - σ sqrt(T))^2 / 2} * (1/sqrt(2π)) dz,

where d = (a - μ)/(σ sqrt(T)).

So, the integral is the probability that z' <= d, where z' is a standard normal variable (since the integrand is the standard normal PDF). But wait, the integrand is shifted by σ sqrt(T), so the integral is P(z' <= d - σ sqrt(T)), which is N(d - σ sqrt(T)).

So, putting it all together:

E[e^y I_{y <= a}] = e^{μ + σ² T / 2} * N( d - σ sqrt(T) )

But now, substituting back the values:

μ = (r - q - σ²/2) T,

so μ + σ² T / 2 = (r - q - σ²/2) T + σ² T / 2 = (r - q) T.

Thus, E[e^y I_{y <= a}] = e^{(r - q) T} * N( d - σ sqrt(T) )

Where d = [ln K - (r - q - σ²/2) T ] / (σ sqrt(T)).

Wait, let me write this again:

E[S_T I_{S_T <= K}] = e^{(r - q) T} * N( [ ln(K/S_0) + (r - q - σ²/2) T ] / (σ sqrt(T)) - σ sqrt(T) )

Wait, because a = ln K,

so d = [ ln K - μ ] / (σ sqrt(T)) = [ ln K - (r - q - σ²/2) T ] / (σ sqrt(T)).

Then, d - σ sqrt(T) = [ ln K - (r - q - σ²/2) T ] / (σ sqrt(T)) - σ sqrt(T).

Let me combine terms:

= [ ln K - (r - q - σ²/2) T - σ² T ] / (σ sqrt(T)).

Because when you subtract σ sqrt(T), you're effectively subtracting [σ² T]/(σ sqrt(T))) which is σ sqrt(T). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to compute numerator as:

ln K - (r - q) T + (σ²/2) T - σ² T = ln K - (r - q) T - (σ²/2) T.

So, d - σ sqrt(T) = [ ln K - (r - q) T - (σ²/2) T ] / (σ sqrt(T)).

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that:

d - σ sqrt(T) = [ ln K - μ ] / (σ
