Okay, so I have this problem here where a group of friends went out for lunch. Some bought salads and others bought soup. I need to figure out the total cost for all the salads and soups combined. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that 'd' people bought salads and 'p' people bought soups. Each salad costs $3.99, and each soup is $2.99. Hmm, right. So I need to find the total cost, which means I have to calculate the cost for all the salads and add it to the cost for all the soups.

So, for the salads: if each salad is $3.99 and 'd' people bought them, then the total cost for salads would be 3.99 multiplied by d. That makes sense because each person buys one salad, so multiplying the price by the number of people gives the total cost.

Similarly, for the soups: each soup is $2.99, and 'p' people bought them. So the total cost for soups would be 2.99 multiplied by p. Again, each person buys one soup, so this calculation should give the total cost for all the soups.

Now, the question asks for the total costs of both the soup and salads. So I need to add these two amounts together. That would be (3.99 * d) plus (2.99 * p). Let me write that out as an expression: 3.99d + 2.99p.

Wait, let me double-check. Oh right, multiplication comes before addition in order of operations, but since each term is separate, I don't need parentheses around them unless specified. So the expression is just 3.99d plus 2.99p.

Looking at the options provided, I need to find which one matches this expression. Let's go through each option:

Option A: (3.99 + 2.99)p — No, that would add the prices first and then multiply by p, which doesn't make sense because salads and soups are separate.

Option B: (3.99p + 2.99)d — Hmm, this would multiply the sum by d, which isn't correct because d is the number of salads and p is soups. They should be separate terms.

Option C: 2.99(d + p) — This would calculate the cost if everyone bought soup, which isn't the case.

Option D: 3.99d + 2.99p — Yes, that's exactly what I came up with. Each term is calculated separately and then added.

Option E: 2.99p + 3.99d — Wait, this is the same as D, just written in reverse. Addition is commutative, so the order doesn't matter. So E is also correct mathematically.

But looking back at the options, D and E are the same expressions but with terms swapped. Let me check the problem again. The question asks for an expression, and both D and E are correct. But wait, looking again at the options, I think I might have misread.

Wait, the question says "the total costs of the soup and salads." So the order in the expression doesn't matter as addition is commutative. So both D and E would be correct. But wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, D is "3.99d + 2.99p" and E is "2.99p + 3.99d". Since both are algebraically the same, but perhaps the intended answer is D because it lists salads first (d) and then soups (p), matching the order in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem statement says "d people buy salad and p people buy soup." So they mention salads first, then soups. So the expression might follow that order. So D would be 3.99d (salads) plus 2.99p (soups), which aligns with the problem's order.

But wait, the options provided are each unique. So I need to see which one matches. Both D and E are correct mathematically, but perhaps only one is present. Wait, looking back, option D is 3.99d + 2.99p and option E is 2.99p + 3.99d. So both are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is D because it follows the order of the problem.

Wait a second, perhaps I should check all options again to make sure there isn't a trick. Let me see:

Option F: (3.99p + 2.99p) — That would be if all people bought both, which isn't the case.

Option G: 3.99p + 2.99d — Wait, no, that would be if p bought salads and d bought soups, which is opposite of the problem. The problem states d buys salads and p buys soups. So G would be incorrect because it's 3.99p (salads for p people) and 2.99d (soups for d people), which is the opposite.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Each salad is 3.99, and d is the number of people buying salads. So 3.99 must be multiplied by d. Similarly, 2.99 is the soup price, multiplied by p. So the correct terms are 3.99d and 2.99p. So option D has 3.99d + 2.99p, which is correct. Option E is 2.99p + 3.99d, which is the same as D. So why are both D and E present? Oh, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the options.

Wait the options are A to J. Let me list them again:

A: (3.99 + 2.99)p → No.

B: (3.99p + 2.99)d → No, because it's (salad price * p + soup price) multiplied by d, which is wrong.

C: 2.99(d + p) → Only soup cost considered for everyone, incorrect.

D: 3.99d + 2.99p → Yes, correct.

E: 2.99p + 3.99d → Also correct, same as D.

Wait, but in the options, both D and E are present. So this is confusing. How can there be two correct options? That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no— looking again, option E is 2.99p + 3.99d, which is correct. So both D and E are correct mathematically. But perhaps the way the options are written, only one is intended as the correct answer.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: write an expression for the total costs of the soup and salads. So it doesn't specify the order, so any form that correctly adds the two products is acceptable.

In that case, both D and E would be correct. But looking at the options, the correct ones are D and E. But the possible answers only have one correct option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, when I look at the options again, perhaps I misread. Let me check:

Looking at the options, option D is 3.99d + 2.99p, and option E is 2.99p + 3.99d. As addition is commutative, both are the same. So perhaps the intended answer is either D or E. But in the multiple-choice questions, each letter corresponds to a unique option, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look back at the way the question is phrased. It says "the total costs of the soup and salads." So perhaps the expression should list soups first, then salads. Or vice versa, but the problem says "soup and salads," so maybe the order in the expression doesn't matter as it's just an expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D because it's written as salads first, which matches 'd' people buying salads. But that's just a guess.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it another way. Let me compute both D and E numerically with sample numbers to see if they give the same result.

Let me pick d=2 and p=3.

D: 3.99*2 + 2.99*3 = 7.98 + 8.97 = 16.95.

E: 2.99*3 + 3.99*2 = 8.97 + 7.98 = 16.95.

Same result. So both D and E are correct. But in the given options, both D and E are present. So perhaps the question has a typo, but assuming that only one option is correct, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in reading the options. Let me look again.

Wait, looking back, the problem says "salad and p people buy soup." So d is for salads, p for soups.

So the correct terms are 3.99*d (salads) and 2.99*p (soups). So the expression is 3.99d + 2.99p, which is option D. Option E is 2.99p +3.99d, which is the same thing, but the order is swapped.

But why are both options present? Unless I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps I should look again at the options.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check:

Option D says 3.99d + 2.99p.

Option E says 2.99p + 3.99d.

Ah, wait, no—option E says 2.99p + 3.99d. Wait, no, 3.99d is correct for salads. So both D and E are correct. But that's impossible in a multiple-choice setting. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is either D or E, but when looking back, perhaps only one is present. Wait, the options are:

Options:

A: (3.99 + 2.99)p → No.

B: (3.99p + 2.99)d → No.

C: 2.99(d + p) → No.

D: 3.99d + 2.99p → Yes.

E: 2.99p + 3.99d → Yes.

F: (3.99p + 2.99p) → No.

G: 3.99p + 2.99d → Wait, this would be if p bought salads and d bought soups. Because 3.99 is salad price, multiplied by p, which would be wrong because p is the number of soups. So G is incorrect.

H: (2.99 + 3.99)(p + d) → No, that's combining both prices and both people, which isn't right.

I: 3.99(d + p) → No, that's salads for everyone.

J: 2.99d + 3.99p → Wait, this is the same as 3.99p + 2.99d? No, wait. Let me see: J is 2.99d + 3.99p. Wait, that would mean d people bought soups and p bought salads, which is the opposite of the problem. Because in the problem, d is salads and p is soups. So J would be incorrect.

Wait, no: the problem says d people buy salad (so 3.99 * d) and p buy soup (2.99 * p). So the correct expression is 3.99d + 2.99p. So option D is correct. Option E is 2.99p + 3.99d, which is the same. But option J is 2.99d + 3.99p, which would imply that d people bought soups and p bought salads, which is incorrect. So option J is wrong.

So, in conclusion, the correct options are D and E, but since only one can be correct, perhaps the intended answer is D. Or wait, perhaps I should think again.

Wait, no, perhaps the way the options are written, D is 3.99d + 2.99p, which is correct. E is 2.99p + 3.99d, which is the same as D. So both are correct. But in the given options, both D and E are present, which is confusing. However, perhaps the intended answer is D because it follows the order of the problem statement, which mentions salads first, then soups.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct expression is 3.99d + 2.99p, which is option D.

To determine the total costs of the soup and salads, we start by calculating the cost for each item separately. Let:

- \( d \) represent the number of people who buy salads, with each salad costing $3.99.
- \( p \) represent the number of people who buy soups, with each soup costing $2.99.

The total cost for salads is \( 3.99d \), and the total cost for soups is \( 2.99p \). The overall total cost is the sum of these two amounts:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 3.99d + 2.99p
\]

Now, we compare this expression to the given options:

- **A**: \( (3.99 + 2.99)p \) — Incorrect, as it adds the prices first and then multiplies by \( p \), which does not account for separate purchases of salads and soups.
- **B**: \( (3.99p + 2.99)d \) — Incorrect, as it multiplies the sum of terms by \( d \), which misrepresents the relationship between the variables.
- **C**: \( 2.99(d + p) \) — Incorrect, as it assumes only soups are purchased by all \( d + p \) people.
- **D**: \( 3.99d + 2.99p \) — Correct, as it matches the derived expression for total cost.
- **E**: \( 2.99p + 3.99d \) — Mathematically identical to \( D \), but the order of terms is reversed.
- **F**: \( (3.99p + 2.99p) \) — Incorrect, as it assumes all \( p \) people buy both items.
- **G**: \( 3.99p + 2.99d \) — Incorrect, as it swaps the prices for salads and soups.
- **H**: \( (2.99 + 3.99)(p + d) \) — Incorrect, as it combines both prices and multiplies by the total number of people, which is not the correct approach.
- **I**: \( 3.99(d + p) \) — Incorrect, as it assumes only salads are purchased by all \( d + p \) people.
- **J**: \( 2.99d + 3.99p \) — Incorrect, as it swaps the prices for salads and soups.

While both \( D \) and \( E \) are mathematically correct, \( D \) is preferred as it aligns with the order of the problem statement, which mentions salads first and soups second. Therefore, the best answer is:

**D**
