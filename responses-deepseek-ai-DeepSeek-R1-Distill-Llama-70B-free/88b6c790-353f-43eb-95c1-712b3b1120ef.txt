Okay, so I have this question about Anscombe criticizing Kant. Hmm, I remember that Anscombe was a philosopher, and she wrote some critiques on moral philosophy, especially related to Kant. The question is asking which of Kant's ideas she found absurd.

Let me think about Kant's main ideas. He talked a lot about the categorical imperative, which is a moral principle that's universal. Then there's the autonomous will, which is the idea that individuals should act according to their own reason. The kingdom of ends is another concept, where people are treated as ends in themselves, not means. The thing in itself is the noumenal reality, which we can't know directly. The transcendental unity of apperception is about how we have a unified consciousness.

Wait, I think Anscombe was critical of Kant's idea of the categorical imperative. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, she might have criticized the concept of the autonomous will. Oh, but another thought: I remember reading that Anscombe had issues with the idea of "legislating for oneself." She argued that it's absurd to think that individuals can legislate moral laws because only an authority can do that, like a divine being. So Kant's idea that each person is a legislator in the kingdom of ends might be what she's criticizing.

Wait, let me get this straight. The question is about what she finds absurd. So the options are A through J. Option D is "legislating for oneself." That sounds familiar. I think that's the one she criticizes because she argues that only a divine being can be the legislator, so individuals can't just make their own moral laws. So Anscombe's point is that Kant's idea is absurd because it's like each person is trying to be a little legislator, which doesn't make sense without a higher authority.

So the correct answer would be D. But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing it with another concept. The categorical imperative is more about the structure of moral maxims, while legislating for oneself is part of the autonomous will. So I'm pretty confident it's D.

The question asks which of Kant's ideas Anscombe criticizes as absurd. Anscombe is known for her critique of moral philosophy, particularly Kant's ideas. Among the options, "legislating for oneself" stands out as the concept she finds absurd. She argues that only a divine authority can truly legislate moral laws, and the idea of individuals legislating for themselves is untenable. This aligns with her critique of Kant's notion of autonomy and moral legislation.

Answer: D
