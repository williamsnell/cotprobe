Question:

In 1998, a farmer, advancing in age, realizes that he is no longer able to farm his 1,000 acres and therefore decides to sell some of the farmland in parcels of 250 acres. The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the farmer and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the farmer and the development company contains a provision expressly binding "upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns," stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single- family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the farmer's death, his estate isrequired to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The area surrounding phase 1 and phase 2 was rezoned for commercial and industrial uses in 2010. The investor's shopping center has grown to include 150 stores. Now, one of the lot owners in phase 1 contracts to sell his property to two physicians who plan to start a suburban medical practice. In an action by the homeowners in phase 1 to prevent such commercial use by the physicians, the court will most likely hold that

Options:

A: the restrictions are still enforceable, but only for the original buyers from the development company.
B: the restrictions are not enforceable because the investor was able to construct a shopping center on the remaining farmland.
C: the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the offering of personal services (i. e. , medical) would be a conforming use.
D: the restrictions could be enforceable if the court considers the medical practice as a commercial enterprise.
E: the restrictions would no longer be enforceable because the medical practice is considered a necessary service for the community.
F: the restrictions are not enforceable because the surrounding area has been rezoned for commercial and industrial uses.
G: the restrictions are still enforceable, thus preventing such commercial use.
H: the restrictions are not enforceable because they were not mentioned in the deeds to the buyers of phase 2 homes.
I: the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because of the change in the character of the neighborhood.
J: the restrictions would no longer be enforceable, because the opening of a physician's office in a private home would not be construed as a commercial enterprise.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this real property law question, and honestly, it's a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step. Let me start by understanding the scenario.

So, there's a farmer who owns 1,000 acres and decides to sell it in parcels of 250 acres each. The president of a development company buys three of the four parcels. The deed between the farmer and the development company has a restriction: any further subdivisions must be into minimum two-acre lots for single-family homes only. This restriction is binding on all subsequent grantees, heirs, and assigns.

The development company then subdivides two parcels into 3, 4, and 5-acre lots, which I guess is allowed since the minimum is two acres. They build homes, and these are part of Phase 1. The deeds for these homes include the original restrictions, so the buyers know about them.

Then, two years later, the president sells the remaining third parcel (another 250 acres) to a contractor. This contractor subdivides it into one-acre lots, which violates the original restriction because the minimum was two acres. But when the contractor sells these Phase 2 homes, the deeds don't mention the restriction. So Phase 2 owners might not be aware of it.

After that, the farmer's estate sells the last 250-acre parcel to an investor who builds a shopping center with 150 stores. Also, the surrounding area was rezoned for commercial and industrial use in 2010. Now, a Phase 1 homeowner wants to sell to two physicians who plan to start a medical practice. The Phase 1 homeowners are trying to stop this, claiming it's a commercial use violating the restrictions.

The question is about whether the court will enforce the restrictions against the physicians' commercial use.

Alright, so I need to figure out if the restrictions are still enforceable in this situation.

First, I remember that for a restrictive covenant to be enforceable, it must meet certain criteria. It should be in writing, properly recorded, and there should be horizontal privity (between the original parties) and vertical privity (the covenant runs with the land). Also, the burden and benefit must touch and concern the land.

In this case, the original deed has the restriction, so it's in writing and should have been recorded. The restriction is meant to bind all subsequent grantees, so vertical privity is there. The restriction touches and concerns the land because it's about the use of the property, which affects the value.

Now, the issue is whether the restriction is still enforceable against the physicians. The key here is whether the covenant is still in effect and whether it's enforceable against them.

I think about the concept of "change in character of the neighborhood." If the surrounding area has changed significantly, it might affect the enforceability. The area was rezoned for commercial and industrial use, and a shopping center was built. So the neighborhood is now more commercial than residential.

Also, the contractor in Phase 2 violated the restriction by subdividing into one-acre lots, and the deeds didn't mention the restriction. That might have weakened the enforceability because if subsequent purchasers didn't have notice, they might not be bound.

But wait, the medical practice is in Phase 1. The Phase 1 deeds included the restrictions, so the original homeowners there are bound. But when a Phase 1 owner sells, does the restriction still apply to the new buyer?

I think about the idea that once a restrictive covenant is in place, it runs with the land, so all subsequent owners are bound, provided it's properly recorded and there's privity.

But another point is whether the covenant has been breached in a way that affects its enforceability. The contractor in Phase 2 violated the two-acre minimum, but Phase 1's deeds included the restriction, so maybe Phase 1 is still bound.

However, the surrounding area's change to commercial use might affect this. There's a doctrine that if the character of the neighborhood changes so much that the original purpose of the restriction is no longer served, the court might find the restriction no longer enforceable.

In this case, the area is now rezoned, and there's a big shopping center nearby. The physicians' office is a commercial use, but it's within a home in Phase 1. So is that a violation?

Wait, the restriction says that subdivisions must be for single-family homes only. It doesn't explicitly prohibit commercial use in existing homes. Or does it? Let me check the original restriction: it says any subdivisions by any persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots for single-family dwellings only. So it's about subdivision, not use. So if someone uses their single-family home for a commercial purpose, like a home office or medical practice, does that violate the restriction?

Hmm, maybe not directly. The restriction is about subdivision, not use. So the physicians using their home for a medical practice might not violate the subdivision restriction. Unless the covenant also includes a use restriction, but the question says it's about subdivisions.

Wait, the deed says "any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single-family dwelling units only." So the restriction is on how you can subdivide the land, not on the use of the land after subdivision. So perhaps the use as a medical office isn't a violation because it's not a subdivision issue.

Wait, but maybe the covenant also implies that the lots can only be used for single-family homes, not for commercial purposes. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, if the restriction is only about the size of the lots when subdividing, then using a lot for commercial purposes (like a home-based business) might not violate the size restriction but could violate a use restriction if there was one. But the problem states that the restriction is about subdivisions, not about use. So maybe the physicians' use isn't a violation of the restriction.

But wait, the Phase 1 homeowners are trying to prevent the sale because of the commercial use. They're relying on the original deed restriction. If the restriction was only about subdivisions into two-acre lots, then the use as a medical practice wouldn't be a problem. Unless there's a separate use restriction I'm missing.

Wait, reading the question again, the deed restriction says "restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single-family dwelling units only." So it's both the size and the use. So any subdivision must create lots that are at least two acres and used only for single-family homes.

But once the lot is subdivided into two-acre lots (as in Phase 1), each lot is used for a single-family home. If someone later uses that home for a commercial purpose, like a medical practice, does that violate the use part of the restriction?

So the restriction is that the lots must be used for single-family dwellings only. Therefore, using a lot for a commercial purpose (even in a home) would violate the restriction.

But then, the question is whether the restriction is still enforceable. Because the surrounding area has changed, the shopping center is there, and the contractor's Phase 2 violated the restriction.

I think the key issue is whether the change in the neighborhood affects the enforceability. The covenant might have been enforceable before, but if the neighborhood has changed so much, maybe it's no longer equitable to enforce it.

There's a legal doctrine called "changed circumstances" or "change in character of the neighborhood," which can render a restrictive covenant unenforceable if the surrounding area's character changes so that enforcing the covenant would no longer achieve its original purpose.

In this case, the area is now zoned commercial and industrial, and there's a large shopping center nearby. So the residential character has changed to commercial. Therefore, enforcing the restriction against a medical office (which is a commercial use) in Phase 1 might no longer make sense because the neighborhood is now commercial.

So the court might find that the restrictions are no longer enforceable because the neighborhood's character has changed, making the original purpose of the restriction moot.

Looking at the options, option I says the restrictions would no longer be enforceable because of the change in the neighborhood's character. Option J says it's not enforceable because a physician's office in a home isn't a commercial enterprise, but I think a medical practice is considered commercial. Option C says it's conforming because it's a necessary service, but I don't think that's the main point here.

Option D says the restrictions could be enforceable if the court sees it as commercial, but that's not addressing the enforceability based on neighborhood change.

Option F says it's unenforceable because of rezoning, but rezoning alone doesn't necessarily negate a covenant; it's more about the neighborhood's actual change.

So the best option seems to be I: the restrictions would no longer be enforceable because the neighborhood's character has changed.

The question revolves around the enforceability of a restrictive covenant in a changing neighborhood. The original restriction, included in the deed, requires that any subdivisions be limited to minimum two-acre lots for single-family dwelling units only. This restriction was intended to bind all subsequent grantees, heirs, and assigns. However, several developments have occurred: the contractor subdivided a parcel into one-acre lots (violating the restriction), the surrounding area was rezoned for commercial and industrial use, and a large shopping center was built. Now, Phase 1 homeowners seek to prevent a commercial use (a medical practice) in their subdivision, arguing it violates the restriction.

For a restrictive covenant to be enforceable, it must meet certain criteria, including being in writing, properly recorded, and touching and concerning the land. Here, the restriction was in writing and recorded, and it touches and concerns the land by affecting its use and value. However, the key issue is whether the covenant remains enforceable given the significant changes in the neighborhood.

The doctrine of "change in character of the neighborhood" holds that if the surrounding area changes so much that the original purpose of the restriction is no longer served, the covenant may no longer be enforceable. In this case, the area has been rezoned for commercial and industrial use, and a shopping center has been built, fundamentally altering the neighborhood's character from residential to commercial. This change undermines the purpose of the original restriction, which was to maintain a residential character with single-family homes on larger lots.

While the restriction was enforceable when the neighborhood was residential, the commercialization of the area and the violation of the restriction in Phase 2 weaken its enforceability. The court is likely to find that the restrictions are no longer enforceable because the change in the neighborhood's character has rendered the original purpose of the restriction obsolete.
