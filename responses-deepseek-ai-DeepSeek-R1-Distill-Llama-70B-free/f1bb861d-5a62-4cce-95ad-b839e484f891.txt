Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Belbin team roles question. Hmm, I remember Belbin talked about different roles people take in a team. The question is about an extroverted and enthusiastic person. Let me think about each option.

First, the options are A to G. The question is asking which role fits someone who's extroverted and enthusiastic. Let me go through each role one by one.

A: Problem Solver. Not sure, but I think problem solvers are more analytical, maybe introverted? They might focus on solving issues rather than being outgoing.

B: Resource Investigator. Wait, I remember this role. Resource Investigators are the ones who go out and find resources, make contacts. They're enthusiastic and good at networking. That sounds extroverted.

C: Specialist. Specialists are experts in their field, focused on their area. They might not necessarily be extroverted; they could be more focused on their work than interacting.

D: Monitor Evaluator. These people evaluate ideas and make decisions. They're probably more reflective and less outgoing. They might be more reserved.

E: Completer Finisher. They make sure everything is done on time and to standard. They might be detail-oriented and thorough, but I'm not sure if they're necessarily extroverted.

F: Innovator. Oh wait, isn't that the same as a Plant in Belbin's terms? Innovators come up with new ideas. They might be creative but not necessarily extroverted; some could be introverted.

G: Implementer. Implementers are organized and good at turning plans into action. They might be more practical and structured, but not specifically extroverted.

So putting it together, the Resource Investigator (B) is the one who is extroverted, enthusiastic, and good at exploring opportunities. They're the ones who go out, network, and bring in new ideas and resources. That fits the description given.
