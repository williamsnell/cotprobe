Okay, so I've got this problem where Mr. Langham is taking a loan of $60 from his bank. The nominal interest rate is 6%, and he's going to repay it in equal installments over 15 months. I need to find out how much each monthly payment will be.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with loans and installment payments, this is an annuity problem. The formula for calculating the monthly payment (PMT) involves the present value (PV), the interest rate per period, and the number of periods. 

Wait, the nominal rate is 6% per year, but the payments are monthly, so I think I need to convert the annual rate to a monthly rate. Oh right, because each payment is monthly, so the rate per period would be 6% divided by 12 months. Let me calculate that: 6% is 0.06, so 0.06/12 is 0.005. So each month, the interest rate is 0.5%.

Now, the number of periods (n) is 15 months because he's paying back over 15 months. So n=15.

The present value (PV) is the loan amount, which is $60. I'm trying to find the payment (PMT) each month. The formula I remember is the present value of an ordinary annuity formula, which is PMT = PV * [i(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n -1]. Or wait, maybe it's PMT = (PV * i) / (1 - (1+i)^-n)). Oh right, those are the same formulas; one is just rearranged.

Let me write that down. PMT = PV * i [ (1 + i)^n ] / [ (1 + i)^n - 1 ]

Wait, or is it PMT = (PV * i) / [1 - (1 + i)^-n ]? I think both are correct. Let me plug in the numbers either way.

So PV is $60, i is 0.005, n is 15.

Let me compute the denominator first. 1 - (1 + 0.005)^-15. Let's calculate (1.005)^-15. Hmm, wait, 1.005 to the power of 15. Let me see, 1.005^15 is approximately e^(15*0.005) since for small x, ln(1+x) ≈x. But wait, maybe it's better to calculate it step by step.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to compute this without a calculator. But I'm trying to think through this, so let me proceed.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for PMT as:

PMT = (PV * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)

Where r is the periodic interest rate. So r is 0.005, n=15, PV=60.

So PMT = (60 * 0.005) / (1 - (1.005)^-15)

Let me compute the denominator first: 1 - (1.005)^-15.

I think I need approximate values here. Let me see, (1.005)^15. Let's compute it step by step.

1.005^1 = 1.005
^2 = 1.010025
^3 ≈ 1.015075
^4 ≈ 1.020150
^5≈1.025251
^6≈1.030338
^7≈1.035563
^8≈1.040839
^9≈1.046167
^10≈1.051468
^11≈1.056823
^12≈1.062234
^13≈1.067702
^14≈1.073227
^15≈1.078929

Wait, that's (1.005)^15 ≈ 1.078929. So (1.005)^-15 is 1 / 1.078929 ≈ 0.9268.

So denominator is 1 - 0.9268 = 0.0732.

Now, numerator is 60 * 0.005 = 0.3.

So PMT ≈ 0.3 / 0.0732 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that. 0.3 divided by 0.0732.

Hmm, 0.0732 * 4 = 0.2928, which is just under 0.3. So 4.0 gives 0.2928, the difference is 0.0072. So 0.0072 / 0.0732 is approximately 0.0984. So about 4.0984, which is approximately $4.10 per month.

Wait, looking at the options, option G is $4.10, which would match this.

But wait, I'm a bit concerned about the approximation of (1.005)^15. Maybe using a more accurate value would change the result a little. Alternatively, perhaps I should use logarithms or a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (1.005)^15 more accurately.

Another approach: Using the formula for compound interest, but let me think of a better way. Maybe using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula, which is PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + i)^-n ] / i.

Wait, but I think I did it correctly earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value for (1.005)^15.

Wait, 1.005^15 can be calculated more accurately. Let me try a different approach. Since 1.005^12 is approximately 1.061678 (I remember this from somewhere), maybe I can use that as a base.

So 1.005^12 = approx 1.061678. Then, 1.005^15 = (1.005^12) * (1.005)^3.

We already calculated (1.005)^3 as approximately 1.015075.

So 1.061678 * 1.015075 = ?

Let me compute that:

1.061678 * 1.015075.

Multiply 1.061678 by 1.015075.

Approximately, 1.061678 * 1.015 = 1.061678 * (1 + 0.015) = 1.061678 + (1.061678 * 0.015).

1.061678 * 0.015 = approx 0.01592317.

So adding, 1.061678 + 0.01592317 ≈ 1.077601.

So 1.005^15 ≈ 1.0776, so 1/(1.005^15) ≈ 0.9272.

So denominator becomes 1 - 0.9272 = 0.0728.

Then PMT = (60 * 0.005) / 0.0728 → 0.3 / 0.0728 ≈ ?

0.3 divided by 0.0728: let's see, 0.0728 *4 = 0.2912, which is less than 0.3. The difference is 0.0088. 0.0088 / 0.0728 ≈ 0.1208. So it's 4 + 0.1208 ≈ 4.1208. Hmm, so about $4.12 per month.

Looking at the options, G is $4.10 and F is $4.00, and D is $4.50. So perhaps my approximation is a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I should do a more precise calculation.

Wait, maybe I should use more accurate (1.005)^15. Let me try to calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute (1.005)^15 using more precise steps.

1.005^1 = 1.005
^2 = 1.005 * 1.005 = 1.010025
^3 = 1.010025 * 1.005 = let's compute:
1.010025 * 1.005:
Multiply 1.010025 by 1.005:
1.010025 * 1 = 1.010025
1.010025 * 0.005 = 0.005050125
Add them: 1.010025 + 0.005050125 = 1.015075125

^4: 1.015075125 * 1.005.
Compute 1.015075125 * 1.005:

1.015075125 * 1 = 1.015075125
1.015075125 * 0.005 = 0.005075375625
Total: 1.015075125 + 0.005075375625 = 1.020150500625

Sum: ≈ 1.0723211319275 + 0.0053616056596 ≈ 1.0776827375871

So (1.005)^15 ≈ 1.0776827375871. Therefore, (1.005)^-15 ≈ 1 / 1.0776827375871 ≈ 0.9278506.

So denominator: 1 - 0.9278506 ≈ 0.0721494.

Numerator is 60 * 0.005 = 0.3.

So PMT ≈ 0.3 / 0.0721494 ≈ Let's compute this.

0.3 divided by 0.0721494.

Let me compute 0.3 / 0.0721494.

I can write this as 300 / 72.1494 ≈ 4.16.

Wait, because 0.0721494 multiplied by 4.16 gives approximately 0.3.

So 4.16 per month. Hmm, but in my earlier approximation with less precise numbers, I got around 4.10 or 4.12.

But the options don't have 4.16. The closest option is G:4.10, and F is 4.00. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let's try a different approach. Maybe use the present value of annuity formula correctly.

Wait, maybe I should use the PMT formula correctly. PMT = (PV * i) / [1 - (1 + i)^-n ]

So PV = 60, i=0.005, n=15.

So PMT = (60 * 0.005) / (1 - (1.005)^-15)

As I calculated (1.005)^-15 ≈ 0.9278506, so denominator is 1 - 0.9278506 = 0.0721494.

So 0.3 / 0.0721494 = approximately 4.16.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the interest is being compounded annually, but the payments are monthly. No, the problem states a nominal rate of 6%, so it's probably compounded annually, but the payments are monthly. Or wait, no, usually when dealing with monthly payments, the rate is divided by 12, which I did correctly.

Wait, perhaps the effective interest rate is different, but I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are rounded, so 4.16 would be approximately $4.10 or $4.20. But looking at the options, G is $4.10, and D is $4.50. So perhaps the correct answer is G:4.10.

Wait, but let me try another approach. Maybe I should use the TVM formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each payment step by step, but that's time-consuming.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should use the annuity formula correctly. Let me double-check the formula.

The formula is PMT = (PV * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n )

Yes, that's correct. So plugging in the numbers, I get approximately 4.16, but perhaps the options are rounded down.

Alternatively, maybe the interest is simple interest, but that's unlikely because loans are typically amortized with compound interest.

Wait, if I use simple interest, the calculation would be different. Let me try that.

With simple interest, the total interest would be PV * r * t.

So interest = 60 * 0.06 * (15/12) because 15 months is 1.25 years.

Wait, 15/12 is 1.25. So 60 * 0.06 * 1.25 = 60 * 0.075 = 4.50. So total amount to repay is 60 + 4.50 = 64.50, so each payment is 64.50 /15 = 4.30. So that would be option B:4.30.

Wait, but that's if it's simple interest. The problem states a nominal rate, which usually implies compound interest, but sometimes in problems, it's assumed to be simple unless stated otherwise. Hmm.

So if I use the simple interest approach, I get $4.30 per month, which is option B.

But earlier, with compound interest, I got approximately $4.16, which isn't an option, but G is $4.10, which is close.

Wait, the options include F: $4.00, which is lower, and G:4.10, which is closer to 4.16.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the compound interest calculation. Let me try using more precise values with a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an exact formula application.

Wait, the exact formula is PMT = (PV * i) / (1 - (1 + i)^-n )

So plugging in:

PV = 60, i=0.005, n=15.

So (1 + i)^n = 1.005^15 = approx 1.077889. Wait, earlier calculations gave 1.0776827, but another approximation gives 1.077889. Let me go with 1.077889.

So (1.005)^15 ≈ 1.077889.

So (1.005)^-15 = 1 / 1.077889 ≈ 0.927787.

So denominator: 1 - 0.927787 = 0.072213.

Numerator: 60 * 0.005 = 0.3.

So PMT = 0.3 / 0.072213 ≈ 4.156.

So approximately $4.16 per month.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's impossible because it's a multiple-choice question.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says the nominal rate is 6%. It doesn't specify whether it's compounded annually or monthly. Oh wait, in the context of loans, when the payment is monthly, the
