Question:

A homeowner buys a new leaf blower and is so impressed with its power that he gets carried away and blows large amounts of his work onto the next door neighbor's yard. In addition to leaves, he also blew large amounts of pest-infested plant debris onto the neighbor's property. The material has accumulated into large, unsightly piles and caused damage to the neighbor's healthy plants. He has to pay workers to haul the material away and he incurs expenses to replace infected perennials. The neighbor sues for the tort of trespass. The homeowner files a motion to dismiss because the neighbor cannot prove that homeowner acted with an intent to trespass or to do harm. Will the court grant the motion to dismiss?

Options:

A: Yes, because the homeowner expected the wind to carry the debris away and did not think that it would accumulate on the neighbor's property.
B: No, because the homeowner's actions resulted in a direct invasion of the neighbor's property.
C: Yes, because the debris was not intentionally directed at the neighbor's property.
D: Yes, because the homeowner was not aware of the pest-infested debris.
E: No, because the neighbor was able to prove financial loss from the damage caused.
F: No, because trespass is based on an intentional act of entering the land or sending something onto the land, and the actor does not have to intend harm to be liable for the tort.
G: Yes, because the homeowner had no practical way of controlling where the material went and he acted without malice or ill will.
H: Yes, because the homeowner did not physically enter the neighbor's property.
I: No, because the infected debris constituted an abnormally dangerous condition and homeowner could be held strictly liable for the trespass.
J: No, because the act of blowing debris onto the neighbor's land constitutes a trespass regardless of intent.

Okay, so I've got this tort law question here about trespass, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what I remember about torts, especially trespass to land.

Trespass to land is one of the intentional torts, right? So, the key elements would be an intentional act that causes an unauthorized entry onto someone else's land, resulting in interference with the possessory rights. Now, I think the main thing here is whether the homeowner acted with intent.

Wait, so the question is about whether the court will grant a motion to dismiss. The neighbor sued for trespass, and the homeowner says the neighbor can't prove intent to trespass or intent to do harm. So, the motion is based on lack of intent.

I remember that for trespass, the intent required is the intent to perform the act that results in the trespass, not necessarily intent to cause harm. So, like, if I throw something onto your land on purpose, that's trespass, even if I didn't mean to damage it. But if it's an accident, like I didn't mean to throw it there, maybe that's different.

In this case, the homeowner was using a leaf blower and blew debris onto the neighbor's yard. He was so impressed with its power that he got carried away. So, maybe he was using it in a way that he knew could send debris elsewhere. So, did he intend to send the debris onto the neighbor's land? Or was he just using the blower without thinking about where it goes?

Wait, the options might help. Let me look at them.

Option F says no because trespass is based on an intentional act of entering or sending something onto the land, and the actor doesn't have to intend harm. So, F seems to align with what I was thinking. The intent is to commit the act, not the harm.

Another option is B, which says the result was a direct invasion, so no dismissal. But I think B is more about the result than the intent. Trespass is about intent, so maybe B isn't the right reason.

Option J says trespass is about the act regardless of intent. No, that's not right because trespass does require intent to commit the act. So J might be incorrect.

Option A says yes because he expected wind to carry debris away. So, if he thought the wind would do it, maybe he didn't intend for the debris to land on the neighbor's yard. But wait, if he was blowing it with the leaf blower, maybe he should have known it could go there. So maybe A is a possible defense, but I'm not sure.

Option C says yes because the debris wasn't intentionally directed. But if he was using the blower in a way that he knew could send debris, maybe that's intentional enough. Like, even if he didn't specifically aim at the neighbor's yard, using the blower in a manner that causes the debris to go there could still be intentional.

Option F seems to suggest that intent to do the act is enough, regardless of intent to harm. So the homeowner intentionally used the blower, knowing it could blow debris, which then went onto the neighbor's land. So that would be trespass.

So I think the court would deny the motion to dismiss because the homeowner's intentional act of blowing caused the trespass, regardless of whether he intended harm. So the answer would be F or J? Wait, J says it's trespass regardless of intent, but J might be incorrect because intent is required. So F is better because it specifies the intent to commit the act, not the harm.

Looking back, F says: No, because trespass is based on an intentional act of entering or sending something onto the land, and the actor does not have to intend harm. So yes, that's correct. So the court would not grant the motion to dismiss because intent to send the debris is enough, even without intent to harm.

So the correct answer is F.

The court will not grant the motion to dismiss because trespass to land requires only the intent to perform the act that results in the trespass, not the intent to cause harm. The homeowner intentionally used the leaf blower in a manner that sent debris onto the neighbor's property, which constitutes an intentional act sufficient for trespass liability. The absence of intent to harm does not negate liability in this case.

Answer: F
