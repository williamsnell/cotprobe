Okay, so I have this economics question here about Mrs. Johnson and her potato chips and onion dip consumption. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my consumer choice theory, but let's try to think this through.

So, the question says Mrs. Johnson spends her entire daily budget on chips and dip. Chips are $1 each, dip is $2 each. Right now, her marginal utility (MU) for chips is 12, and for dip, it's 30. The question is asking what she should do to maximize her utility.

Wait, I remember something about the optimal consumption bundle being where the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods. Oh right, the formula is MU_x / P_x = MU_y / P_y. So, when that's equal, you're getting the same utility per dollar for each good, so you can't increase total utility anymore by changing your consumption.

Let me apply that here. So for chips, MU is 12 and price is $1. So MU per dollar is 12/1 = 12. For dip, MU is 30 and price is $2, so 30/2 = 15. Oh wait, so 12 for chips and 15 for dip. They're not equal.

So the idea is that she should adjust her consumption until these are equal. Since dip's MU per dollar is higher (15 vs 12), that suggests she's getting more utility per dollar from dip than from chips. So she should buy more dip and less chips, right? Because when you have a higher MU per dollar on one good, you should consume more of it until the ratios balance.

Wait, but what's the exact condition for utility maximization? It's when the marginal utility per dollar for each good is the same. So she's not there yet. So she should reallocate her spending.

So if she increases her consumption of dip, the MU of dip would decrease, because of the law of diminishing marginal utility. Similarly, if she decreases her consumption of chips, their MU would increase since she's eating less, so each chip is more valuable.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If she buys more dip, each additional dip gives her less utility (diminishing MU). So the MU of dip would go down. And if she buys less chips, each chip becomes more valuable, so the MU of chips might actually increase. Wait, but she's currently at a point where MU of chips is 12. If she buys less, the next chip she would buy (if she had more money) would have higher MU, but wait, no, because she's decreasing her consumption. Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, the MU is the utility of the next unit consumed. So if she reduces her chip consumption, the MU of chips would increase because each chip becomes more precious. But the MU is given as 12 at her current bundle. So if she cuts back on chips, the next chip she would eat (the one she's giving up) has MU 12. But perhaps the next chip she might eat after reducing would have higher MU.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of opportunity cost. Each dip costs $2, which could buy 2 chips. So for every dip she buys instead of chips, she's giving up 2 chips. So the question is whether the marginal utility of dip is worth more than twice the marginal utility of chips.

Wait, let's calculate the marginal utilities per dollar again:

MU of chips is 12 per $1, so 12 per dollar.

MU of dip is 30 per $2, which is 15 per dollar.

So dip gives higher utility per dollar. So she should buy more dip and less chips until the per dollar MUs equalize.

So the optimal point would be when MU_dip / P_dip = MU_chips / P_chips.

So, she should adjust until 30/P_dip = 12/P_chips, but wait, prices are fixed. Or, more accurately, until the current MUs adjust so that  MU_dip / 2 = MU_chips / 1.

So, her current MUs are 30 for dip and 12 for chips. So 30/2 = 15, and 12/1=12. So she's getting more per dollar from dip. So she should buy more dip and less chips.

If she buys more dip, the MU of dip will decrease, and if she buys fewer chips, the MU of chips will increase. She should keep adjusting until the per dollar MUs are equal.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this.

Option E says: decrease her consumption of chips and increase her consumption of dip until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods.

That sounds right. So E.

Alternatively, let's check the other options. Option F says decrease dip and increase chips. That would be if dip had lower MU per dollar, which it doesn't. So F is the opposite.

Option A: do nothing. But since the ratios aren't equal, she's not maximizing utility, so A is wrong.

Options B and C talk about equalizing MUs without considering price. That's not correct because it's MU per dollar that matters, not just MU.

Option D: increase dip until MU equals 12. That doesn't make sense because dip's MU would be much lower, but the ratio isn't considered.

Option G: increase both. But that might not necessarily balance the ratios, and if she's already spending her entire budget, she can't increase both without reallocating.

Option H: same as A, but checking the ratio. H says continue current ratio, which isn't optimal.

Option I: increase dip until MU is 24. 24 would make the ratio 24/2=12, which would match chips' 12/1. So that's also a possible scenario. So if she increases dip until its MU drops to 24, then 24/2=12, same as chips' 12/1. So that would also satisfy the condition.

Wait, so what's the correct approach? Because I thought E was correct, but option I seems to present a scenario where they equalize as well.

Wait, maybe I should think more carefully. The condition is that MU_dip / P_dip = MU_chips / P_chips.

If she increases dip, MU_dip will decrease. So let's say she keeps buying more dip until MU_dip is 24. Then 24/2=12, which is equal to chips' 12/1. So that would make the condition hold. So option I says she should increase dip until MU is 24.

Alternatively, she could adjust both: decrease chips (so MU_chips increases) and increase dip (MU_dip decreases) until the ratios are equal.

So, for instance, if she decreases chips, MU_chips would rise above 12, and increasing dip would lower MU_dip below 30. So perhaps they meet somewhere in the middle.

So which option is correct: E or I?

Looking at the options again, E says she should decrease chips and increase dip until the MUs per dollar are equal. That's the general approach, regardless of the exact MUs. So that's correct.

Option I suggests a specific MU for dip (24), which might not be necessary. Because depending on how the MUs change, the adjustment could vary. So E is the more general correct answer.

So between E and I, which is correct? The question is about what she should do, not necessarily the exact numbers. So the correct action is to adjust her consumption in the way E describes.

So the correct answer is E.

To determine the optimal consumption bundle for Mrs. Johnson, we use the principle of utility maximization, which states that a consumer should allocate their budget such that the marginal utility per dollar (MU/P) is equal for all goods. 

Given:
- Price of chips (P_chips) = $1, Marginal Utility of chips (MU_chips) = 12
- Price of dip (P_dip) = $2, Marginal Utility of dip (MU_dip) = 30

Calculate MU per dollar for each good:
- MU_chips / P_chips = 12 / 1 = 12
- MU_dip / P_dip = 30 / 2 = 15

Since MU per dollar for dip (15) is greater than for chips (12), Mrs. Johnson is getting more utility per dollar from dip. To maximize utility, she should reallocate her budget by increasing her consumption of dip and decreasing her consumption of chips. This adjustment should continue until the MU per dollar for both goods is equal.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A**: Incorrect. Mrs. Johnson is not currently at her utility-maximizing bundle because the MU per dollar for chips and dip are not equal.
- **B**: Incorrect. Increasing chip consumption would lower the MU of chips further, worsening the imbalance.
- **C**: Incorrect. Decreasing dip consumption would increase the MU of dip, making the imbalance worse.
- **D**: Incorrect. Increasing dip consumption indefinitely is not optimal; the goal is to balance MU per dollar.
- **E**: Correct. Decreasing chip consumption and increasing dip consumption will raise the MU of chips and lower the MU of dip until their MU per dollar is equal.
- **F**: Incorrect. Decreasing dip and increasing chips would move her away from the optimal bundle.
- **G**: Incorrect. Increasing both goods would not necessarily balance the MU per dollar.
- **H**: Incorrect. This implies no adjustment is needed, which is false since the MU per dollar is not currently equal.
- **I**: Incorrect. While increasing dip until its MU equals 24 would equalize MU per dollar (24/2 = 12), this is a specific scenario and less general than adjusting both goods as needed.
- **J**: Incorrect. Decreasing chip consumption until MU_chips = 30 is not a valid utility-maximizing condition.

The correct approach is to adjust consumption by decreasing chips and increasing dip until the MU per dollar for both goods is equal, as described in **E**.
