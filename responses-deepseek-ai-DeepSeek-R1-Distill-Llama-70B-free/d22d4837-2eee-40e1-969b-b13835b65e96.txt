Okay, so I have this differential equation to solve using Euler's method. The equation is dy/dx = 3x + 4y. The initial condition is y(0) = 0, and I need to find y(1) with a step size h = 0.25. Hmm, I remember that Euler's method is a numerical way to approximate the solution to a DE, especially when an analytical solution might be tricky.

First, let me recall the formula for Euler's method. I think it's something like y_{n+1} = y_n + h * f(x_n, y_n), where f(x,y) is the derivative dy/dx. So in this case, f(x,y) is 3x + 4y. Right, that makes sense.

So the step size h is 0.25, which means I'll be taking four steps from x=0 to x=1 because 1 divided by 0.25 is 4. Each step will be at x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and then 1. So I need to compute y at each of these points, starting from y(0)=0.

Let me make a table to keep track. I'll list x, y, then compute the next y.

Starting point:
x0 = 0, y0 = 0.

Now, for each step:

Step 1: x0 = 0, y0 = 0.
Compute the slope: f(x0, y0) = 3*(0) + 4*(0) = 0.
So y1 = y0 + h * slope = 0 + 0.25*0 = 0.
x1 = x0 + h = 0.25.

Step 2: x1=0.25, y1=0.
Slope: f(x1,y1) = 3*(0.25) + 4*(0) = 0.75 + 0 = 0.75.
y2 = y1 + 0.25 * 0.75 = 0 + 0.1875 = 0.1875.
x2 = 0.5.

Step3: x2=0.5, y2=0.1875.
Slope: 3*(0.5) +4*(0.1875) = 1.5 + 0.75 = 2.25.
y3 = 0.1875 + 0.25 * 2.25 = 0.1875 + 0.5625 = 0.75.
x3 = 0.75.

Step4: x3=0.75, y3=0.75.
Slope: 3*(0.75) +4*(0.75) = 2.25 +3 =5.25.
y4 = 0.75 + 0.25 *5.25 = 0.75 + 1.3125 = 2.0625.
x4 =1.0.

So y(1) is approximately 2.0625. Now, looking at the options, I see option I is 2.0625. So I think the answer is I.

Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Because sometimes when doing step-by-step, it's easy to slip up.

First step: Everything looks correct. Slope is 0, so y remains 0.

Second step: At x=0.25, y=0. Slope is 0.75. 0.25 *0.75 is 0.1875. So y=0.1875. Correct.

Third step: x=0.5. y is 0.1875. Compute 3*(0.5)=1.5, 4*(0.1875)=0.75. Sum 2.25. Multiply by h, 0.25 *2.25=0.5625. Add to previous y: 0.1875 + 0.5625=0.75. Correct.

Fourth step: x=0.75, y=0.75. Compute 3*0.75=2.25, 4*0.75=3. Sum is 5.25. 0.25 *5.25=1.3125. Add to y: 0.75 +1.3125=2.0625. That's correct.

So yes, the answer should be I: 2.0625.

To solve the differential equation \(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = 3x + 4y\) using Euler's method with the initial condition \(y(0) = 0\) and step size \(h = 0.25\), we approximate the solution at \(x = 1\). Euler's method is given by:

\[
y_{n+1} = y_n + h \cdot f(x_n, y_n),
\]

where \(f(x, y) = 3x + 4y\). Starting from \(x_0 = 0\) and \(y_0 = 0\), we compute the solution at each step:

1. **Step 1**:  
   \(x_0 = 0\), \(y_0 = 0\)  
   \(f(x_0, y_0) = 3(0) + 4(0) = 0\)  
   \(y_1 = y_0 + h \cdot f(x_0, y_0) = 0 + 0.25 \cdot 0 = 0\)  
   \(x_1 = x_0 + h = 0.25\)

2. **Step 2**:  
   \(x_1 = 0.25\), \(y_1 = 0\)  
   \(f(x_1, y_1) = 3(0.25) + 4(0) = 0.75\)  
   \(y_2 = y_1 + h \cdot f(x_1, y_1) = 0 + 0.25 \cdot 0.75 = 0.1875\)  
   \(x_2 = x_1 + h = 0.5\)

3. **Step 3**:  
   \(x_2 = 0.5\), \(y_2 = 0.1875\)  
   \(f(x_2, y_2) = 3(0.5) + 4(0.1875) = 1.5 + 0.75 = 2.25\)  
   \(y_3 = y_2 + h \cdot f(x_2, y_2) = 0.1875 + 0.25 \cdot 2.25 = 0.75\)  
   \(x_3 = x_2 + h = 0.75\)

4. **Step 4**:  
   \(x_3 = 0.75\), \(y_3 = 0.75\)  
   \(f(x_3, y_3) = 3(0.75) + 4(0.75) = 2.25 + 3 = 5.25\)  
   \(y_4 = y_3 + h \cdot f(x_3, y_3) = 0.75 + 0.25 \cdot 5.25 = 2.0625\)  
   \(x_4 = x_3 + h = 1.0\)

Thus, the approximate value of \(y(1)\) is \(2.0625\). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**I: 2.0625**
