Alright, I'm trying to figure out this GARCH and EGARCH question. Okay, let me start by recalling what I know about GARCH models. So, GARCH stands for Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity. It's used to model volatility in financial time series data.

The question is about the criticisms of standard GARCH models and how EGARCH improves upon them. The options are i to iv, and I need to pick which ones EGARCH overcomes.

First, let me go through each criticism one by one.

i) Estimated coefficient values from GARCH models may be negative. Wait, in standard GARCH, the coefficients must satisfy certain conditions to ensure that the volatility is positive. I remember that if the coefficients are negative, it might cause issues because variance can't be negative. But EGARCH, which uses logarithms, doesn't have this problem because it ensures positivity without needing coefficients to be positive. So EGARCH can handle negative coefficients, I think. So EGARCH would solve problem i.

ii) GARCH models cannot account for leverage effects. Leverage effect refers to the phenomenon where volatility increases more in response to negative returns than positive ones. I recall that GARCH models have symmetric responsesâ€”meaning they treat positive and negative shocks the same. But EGARCH can model asymmetric effects because it includes a term that allows for different reactions to positive and negative returns. So EGARCH addresses ii.

iii) The responsiveness of future volatility to positive and negative shocks is symmetric under GARCH. Yes, as I just thought, GARCH is symmetric. EGARCH, on the other hand, allows for asymmetric responses, so point iii is a problem that EGARCH solves.

iv) GARCH models cannot allow for feedback from volatility to returns. Hmm. Wait, I think standard GARCH models model volatility but don't include a mechanism where volatility affects the mean returns. Oh, wait, no. Because in a GARCH-in-mean model, the conditional variance is included in the mean equation. But regular GARCH doesn't include that feedback. Wait, but the question is about standard GARCH. So in plain vanilla GARCH, the volatility is modeled, but there's no term that allows the returns to be influenced by volatility. Wait, no, standard GARCH models typically have the mean equation as an ARMA, and the variance as GARCH. So if you have a GARCH model that doesn't include the variance in the mean equation, then it doesn't allow feedback. But if you have a GARCH-M model, then it does. So the question is about standard GARCH, which may not have that.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. EGARCH, as I recall, doesn't necessarily address the feedback from volatility to returns. That's more about whether the model includes a volatility term in the mean equation, which is separate from the GARCH vs EGARCH difference. So the ability to have feedback would require a GARCH-in-mean model, which isn't directly tied to whether it's GARCH or EGARCH. So if iv is about GARCH not allowing feedback, then EGARCH may not solve that. Because EGARCH is about the variance equation, not the mean equation.

Wait, but the question is about what EGARCH can overcome. So let's see:

i) GARCH might have negative coefficients which can cause issues, but EGARCH handles it because it uses log approach. So EGARCH solves i.

ii) GARCH can't account for leverage effect because it's symmetric. EGARCH can because it's asymmetric. So EGARCH solves ii.

iii) Same as ii, so EGARCH solves iii.

iv) Whether GARCH allows feedback. Wait, standard GARCH models can include a term where volatility affects returns if it's a GARCH-M model. But if the standard model doesn't include that, then it can't. But the question is about what EGARCH can overcome. EGARCH is about the variance equation, so if the model doesn't include the variance in the mean equation, then it's not about GARCH vs EGARCH. So EGARCH doesn't allow for feedback from volatility to returns. So iv isn't something EGARCH solves.

So the criticisms that EGARCH addresses are i, ii, iii.

Wait, but let me think again. The original statements:

i) Estimated coefficients in GARCH may be negative. EGARCH can have negative coefficients without causing issues because it uses a different parameterization. So i is a problem that EGARCH solves.

ii) GARCH can't account for leverage effects. EGARCH can, so ii is overcome.

iii) Responsiveness is symmetric under GARCH. EGARCH makes it asymmetric, so iii is overcome.

iv) GARCH can't allow feedback from volatility to returns. Whether iv is correct depends on the model. GARCH models can include a term that allows volatility to affect returns (GARCH-M), but if the standard model doesn't, then maybe iv is a problem. But the question is about whether EGARCH solves this. Since EGARCH is about the variance equation, whether or not the mean equation includes volatility is a separate issue. So EGARCH doesn't directly address iv. Therefore, iv remains a problem, and EGARCH doesn't solve it.

So the issues that EGARCH overcomes are i, ii, iii.

Looking at the options, that's E: i, ii, iii. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

E: (i), (ii), and (iii) only.

But wait, in the answer choices, E is (i, ii, iii), yes.

But I thought that in GARCH models, the coefficients can be negative, but in practice, that may not be a problem. Wait, wait, no. Wait, in standard GARCH, the coefficients must be positive to ensure that the variance is positive. So if the estimated coefficients are negative, that's a problem. But in EGARCH, the parameters can be negative because they're in the log equation. So EGARCH can have negative coefficients without causing the variance to become negative. So EGARCH solves i.

So the criticisms overcome are i, ii, iii.

So the correct answer should include i, ii, iii. Looking at the options, option E is (i, ii, iii). So the correct choice is E.

EGARCH models improve upon standard GARCH models by addressing several criticisms. Here's an analysis of the criticisms and how EGARCH overcomes them:

1. **Estimated coefficient values from GARCH models may be negative (i):** In standard GARCH models, coefficients must be non-negative to ensure positive variance. However, EGARCH models use a logarithmic transformation, allowing coefficients to be negative without causing issues. Thus, EGARCH overcomes this limitation.

2. **GARCH models cannot account for leverage effects (ii):** Standard GARCH models assume symmetric responses to positive and negative shocks, but EGARCH models include an asymmetric term that accounts for leverage effects, where negative shocks often lead to greater volatility increases. Therefore, EGARCH addresses this criticism.

3. **The responsiveness of future volatility to positive and negative shocks is symmetric under GARCH (iii):** EGARCH models allow for asymmetric responsiveness, unlike standard GARCH models. This directly resolves the issue of symmetric responsiveness.

4. **GARCH models cannot allow for feedback from volatility to returns (iv):** Whether GARCH models allow feedback from volatility to returns depends on the specific implementation (e.g., GARCH-in-mean models). However, EGARCH primarily focuses on the variance equation and does not inherently address feedback mechanisms in the mean equation. Thus, EGARCH does not resolve this criticism.

In conclusion, EGARCH models overcome criticisms (i), (ii), and (iii), but not (iv). The correct answer is:

**E: (i), (ii), and (iii) only.**
