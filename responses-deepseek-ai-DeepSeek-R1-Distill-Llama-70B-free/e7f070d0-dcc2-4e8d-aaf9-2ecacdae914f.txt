Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with these kinds of operations. Let's see what it says.

The problem defines a new operation, star, such that a star b equals a to the power of b minus a times b. So, the formula is a star b = a^b - a*b. Then it gives me that 2 star x equals 22, and I need to find x from the given options.

Hmm, let's break this down. I think I should substitute a with 2 and b with x in the given equation. So 2 star x would be 2^x minus 2 times x, right? So that's 2^x - 2x = 22. My goal is to solve for x.

Wait, solving exponential equations can be a bit tricky, especially when it's mixed with a linear term. I remember that for equations like this, sometimes trial and error with the given options is the way to go. Let me look at the options provided: they are from A to J, with numbers like 15, 7, 3, etc. 

So maybe I can plug in each option and see which one gives 22 when substituted into 2^x - 2x. Let me list the options again to have them clear:

A:15, B:7, C:3, D:22, E:11, F:10, G:5, H:9, I:4, J:6.

I'll start testing them one by one.

Option C is 3. Let's try x=3. 2^3 is 8, and 2*3 is 6. So 8-6=2. That's way less than 22. So C is not the answer.

Option G is 5. 2^5 is 32, 2*5 is 10. 32-10=22. Oh wait, that's exactly what we're looking for. So x=5 gives 22. So the answer must be G:5.

Wait, but just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me check another option. Let's try option B:7. 2^7 is 128, 2*7 is 14. 128-14 is 114. That's way more than 22. So B is too big.

What about option E:11? 2^11 is 2048, minus 22 is 2026. That's way too high. So no.

Option J:6. 2^6 is 64, 2*6 is 12. 64-12=52. Still larger than 22.

Option H:9. 2^9 is 512, 2*9 is 18. 512-18=494. Nope.

Option I:4. 2^4 is 16, 2*4=8. 16-8=8. Still too low.

Option F:10. 2^10 is 1024, 2*10=20. 1024-20=1004. Way too high.

Option D:22. 2^22 is a huge number, 4,194,304. Minus 44 would still be way over 22. So no.

Option A:15. 2^15 is 32768, minus 30 is 32738. Also way too big.

So the only one that gives exactly 22 is x=5, which is option G. That makes sense. So I think I can confidently choose G as the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we start with the given operation \( a \star b = a^b - ab \). Substituting \( a = 2 \) and \( b = x \), the equation becomes:

\[
2 \star x = 2^x - 2x
\]

We are told that \( 2 \star x = 22 \), so:

\[
2^x - 2x = 22
\]

To find \( x \), we test the provided options:

- **Option C (\( x = 3 \))**: \( 2^3 - 2(3) = 8 - 6 = 2 \) (too low).
- **Option G (\( x = 5 \))**: \( 2^5 - 2(5) = 32 - 10 = 22 \) (correct).
- **Option B (\( x = 7 \))**: \( 2^7 - 2(7) = 128 - 14 = 114 \) (too high).
- **Option E (\( x = 11 \))**: \( 2^{11} - 2(11) = 2048 - 22 = 2026 \) (too high).
- **Option J (\( x = 6 \))**: \( 2^6 - 2(6) = 64 - 12 = 52 \) (too high).
- **Option H (\( x = 9 \))**: \( 2^9 - 2(9) = 512 - 18 = 494 \) (too high).
- **Option I (\( x = 4 \))**: \( 2^4 - 2(4) = 16 - 8 = 8 \) (too low).
- **Option F (\( x = 10 \))**: \( 2^{10} - 2(10) = 1024 - 20 = 1004 \) (too high).
- **Option D (\( x = 22 \))**: \( 2^{22} - 2(22) = 4194304 - 44 = 4194260 \) (too high).
- **Option A (\( x = 15 \))**: \( 2^{15} - 2(15) = 32768 - 30 = 32738 \) (too high).

The only value that satisfies the equation is \( x = 5 \), which corresponds to **Option G**.

**Answer: G**
