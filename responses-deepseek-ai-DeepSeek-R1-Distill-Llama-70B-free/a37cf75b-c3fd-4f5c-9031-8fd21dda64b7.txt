Question:

A behavioral response called a fixed action pattern shown by animals

Options:

A: is a learned behavior that can be unlearned
B: occurs the second time an animal is exposed to the correct stimulus at the appropriate time in its life
C: only occurs during the animal's sleep cycle
D: is a response that only occurs in the presence of other animals
E: is a response that is influenced by the animal's diet
F: is a response that develops as the animal ages
G: is triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment
H: is a motor response which once released may be terminated spontaneously
I: occurs in the absence of sensory feedback
J: is a reflex action triggered by external stimuli

Okay, so I've got this question about fixed action patterns in animals. Hmm, I remember that fixed action patterns are a type of instinctual behavior. Let me think about what I learned in biology class.

Alright, fixed action patterns are behaviors that are genetically programmed and occur in response to specific stimuli. They're also known as instinctive behaviors. I think these are different from learned behaviors because they don't require learning; the animal is born with them.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's a learned behavior that can be unlearned. Wait, no, fixed action patterns are innate, not learned. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B mentions occurring the second time the animal is exposed to a stimulus. That doesn't ring a bell. I thought these patterns can occur even the first time, as they're innate.

Option C says it only happens during sleep. I don't think that's right. Fixed action patterns are responses to specific stimuli, which could happen anytime, not just when sleeping.

Option D claims it's a response in the presence of other animals. Not necessarily. Some fixed actions are social, but others are solitary, like certain courtship displays or hunting behaviors.

Option E suggests it's influenced by diet. I'm not sure, but I don't recall diet being a factor in fixed action patterns. Those are more about the stimulus, not the animal's diet.

Option F says it develops as the animal ages. Maybe, but I think fixed action patterns are present early on. Like, some birds start building nests without learning.

Option G states it's triggered by sensory signals. Yes, fixed action patterns are usually triggered by specific stimuli, like a certain sound or visual cue. So G seems correct.

Option H: motor response that stops spontaneously. I think fixed action patterns can be interrupted, but I'm not sure if that's a defining feature. Maybe, but I'm leaning towards G.

Option I: occurs without sensory feedback. I'm not certain. Fixed actions might use feedback, but I'm not sure if they require it.

Option J: reflex action triggered by external stimuli. Well, reflexes are a type of fixed action, but not all fixed action patterns are simple reflexes. They can be complex behaviors.

So, putting it together, fixed action patterns are triggered by specific stimuli, so option G makes sense. They are motor responses triggered by certain signals in the environment. Like the greylag goose's egg-rolling behavior when they see a round object near the nest.

Fixed action patterns are innate, genetically programmed behaviors triggered by specific stimuli in the environment. They are not learned and can occur in response to particular sensory signals. Among the options, the best description is that these patterns are triggered by sensory signals, making option G the correct answer.

G: is triggered by a number of sensory signals in the animal's environment

Answer: G
