Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"If it be conceded, as it must be by every one who is the least conversant with our institutions, that the sovereign powers delegated are divided between the General and State Governments, and that the latter hold their portion by the same tenure as the former, it would seem impossible to deny to the States the right of deciding on the infractions of their powers, and the proper remedy to be applied for their correction. The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion."
â€”John C. Calhoun, "South Carolina Exposition and Protest," 1828

Okay, so I've got this question here about a passage from John C. Calhoun's "South Carolina Exposition and Protest" from 1828. I need to figure out what issue led to this passage being written. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll read the passage again to understand the context. Calhoun is talking about sovereign powers being divided between the General (federal) and State governments. He argues that the states have the right to decide on infractions of their powers and the remedies for correction. He mentions that the right of judging in such cases is an essential attribute of sovereignty, and if the states don't have this right, they lose their sovereignty and become subordinate. He criticizes the idea of giving the federal government exclusive judgment over the division of powers, saying it would lead to a consolidated government with unlimited powers and strip states of their rights.

So the main themes here are states' rights, sovereignty, and the division of power between federal and state governments. The passage is a protest against federal overreach, specifically regarding an act that South Carolina opposed.

Now, looking at the options, I need to connect this to the historical context of 1828. What was happening around that time that involved states' rights and tariffs?

I remember that the Tariff of 1828, also known as the Tariff of Abominations, was a significant issue. It was a protective tariff that benefited the North but hurt the South because it raised prices on imported goods, which the South relied on since they focused on agriculture and exported cotton. Southern states, especially South Carolina, were strongly against this tariff, leading to tensions.

John C. Calhoun, who was the Vice President at the time and a strong advocate for states' rights, wrote the South Carolina Exposition and Protest in response to this tariff. He argued that the states had the right to nullify federal laws they deemed unconstitutional, which was the Nullification Doctrine. This was a key moment in the nullification crisis of the early 1830s.

Looking at the options, option F is "the passage of an act creating higher tariff rates." That fits because the Tariff of 1828 was exactly about higher tariffs, and it's what prompted Calhoun's protest.

Other options: Option A is secession, but that's more about the Civil War era, later than 1828. Option B, Missouri Compromise, was about slavery and happened in 1820. Option C, slavery in territories, might relate to later events like the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Option D, Louisiana Purchase, was much earlier, 1803. Option E, Indian removal, was part of the Trail of Tears, which was in the 1830s but not directly tied to this specific passage. Option G is states' rights, which is a theme, but the question asks for the specific issue. Option H, internal improvements, was about federal spending on infrastructure, which was another states' rights issue but not the one here. Option I, Second Bank, was about banking and led to the Bank War. Option J, Fugitive Slave Act, was part of the Compromise of 1850.

So the correct answer should be F.

The passage by John C. Calhoun discusses states' rights and the division of power between federal and state governments, arguing against federal overreach. Historically, this was in response to the Tariff of 1828, also known as the Tariff of Abominations, which raised tariffs and disproportionately affected Southern states. Calhoun's protest was a key moment in the nullification crisis, making the issue the passage of an act creating higher tariff rates.

Answer: F
