Okay, so I have this problem about a department store's sales, and I need to find the net sales. Let's see what the question says.

The gross sales this month were $72,800. Returns and allowances are 12% of the net sales. Oh wait, and the formula given is net sales plus returns and allowances equals gross sales. So, I think the equation is: Gross Sales = Net Sales + Returns and Allowances.

Hmm, right. So I need to find the net sales. Let me write that down.

Let me denote Net Sales as N, and Returns and Allowances as R. According to the question, R is 12% of N. So R = 0.12 * N.

And the equation is Gross Sales = N + R. The gross sales are $72,800. So substituting R with 0.12N, the equation becomes:

72,800 = N + 0.12N.

Wait, combining the terms on the right side. N is 1N, so 1N + 0.12N is 1.12N. So the equation is 72,800 = 1.12 * N.

To find N, I need to divide both sides by 1.12. Let me calculate that.

So N = 72,800 / 1.12.

Let me do this division. Hmm, 72,800 divided by 1.12.

Wait, 1.12 times what gives 72,800? Maybe I can simplify this.

Let me see, 72,800 divided by 1.12. Alternatively, I can think of this as 72800 divided by 112/100, which is the same as 72800 * (100/112).

Let me compute that. 72800 * 100 is 7,280,000. Divided by 112.

Now, 7,280,000 divided by 112. Let me see, 112 times 65,000 is 7,280,000 because 112 * 65,000 = 112 * 6.5e4 = 7.28e6 (since 112 * 65 is 7280, so 65,000 is 7280 * 100). Wait, 112 * 65,000 equals 7,280,000. So 7,280,000 divided by 112 is 65,000.

Wait, that would make N = $65,000. But let me check the options. Option C is $65,000.00.

Wait a minute, wait. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the equation.

The formula is Gross Sales = Net Sales + Returns and Allowances. So yes, N + R = 72,800. R is 12% of N, so 0.12N. So substituting gives 72,800 = N + 0.12N = 1.12N.

Solving for N: N = 72,800 / 1.12 = 65,000.

So the net sales are $65,000, which is option C.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C is $65,000.00. So that's the answer.

To determine the net sales, we start with the given information:

- Gross Sales = $72,800  
- Returns and Allowances (R) = 12% of Net Sales (N), so \( R = 0.12N \).  
- The relationship between the variables is \( \text{Gross Sales} = \text{Net Sales} + \text{Returns and Allowances} \), which translates to:  
  \[
  72,800 = N + 0.12N
  \]

Combining terms on the right-hand side:  
\[
72,800 = 1.12N
\]

To solve for \( N \), divide both sides by 1.12:  
\[
N = \frac{72,800}{1.12} = 65,000
\]

Thus, the net sales are $65,000.00, which corresponds to option C.
