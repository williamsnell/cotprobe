Question:

When estimating the total number of Calories required by a personin a day, we consider such factors as sex, amount of activity, and the temperature in which the person lives. Why arethese factors necessary?

Options:

A: Caloric requirements are only influenced by the environmental temperature, not by sex or activity level.
B: Temperature has no effect on caloric requirements.
C: Each person's Caloric requirement differs according to sex, amount of activity and environmental temperature.
D: Caloric requirements are determined by age and sex only, without taking into account activity level or temperature.
E: Only the sex of the person matters for caloric requirements.
F: Caloric requirements are determined by a fixed formula that applies universally, regardless of individual differences.
G: Caloric requirements decrease with increased activity and are independent of sex or environmental factors.
H: Caloric requirement is the same for everyone.
I: Caloric requirements increase only with the amount of activity and are unaffected by sex or temperature.
J: Caloric requirements are solely based on an individual's weight and height, with no consideration for sex, activity, or temperature.

Okay, so I've got this question about estimating daily caloric needs, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that when estimating the total Calories a person needs in a day, factors like sex, activity level, and where they live (temperature) are considered. The question is asking why these factors are necessary.

Hmm, I remember that the human body's energy needs aren't the same for everyone. I think it's because different people have different metabolisms, activity levels, and maybe even environmental factors that affect how much energy they burn.

So the options are A to J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says caloric needs are only influenced by environmental temperature, not sex or activity. That doesn't sound right. I know activity level definitely affects how many calories you burn. For example, athletes need more calories than people who are sedentary. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says temperature has no effect. But I remember that in colder climates, your body needs to burn more energy to stay warm. So if you live where it's cold, your caloric needs might increase. So B can't be correct either.

Option C states each person's caloric needs differ according to sex, activity, and environmental temperature. That makes sense. Men and women might have different metabolisms, activity levels vary a lot, and temperature affects how much energy you use for heating or cooling your body. So C sounds like a good candidate.

Option D: Only age and sex, nothing else. But I know activity level is a big factor. So D is probably not correct.

Option E: Only sex matters. That can't be right because activity definitely plays a role. So E is wrong.

Option F: Fixed formula regardless of individual differences. No, because the question itself is about considering these factors, so F doesn't make sense.

Option G: Calories decrease with increased activity. Wait, that seems opposite. If you're more active, you burn more calories, so your body requires more intake, right? So G is incorrect.

Option H: Same for everyone. No way, everyone's different in terms of these factors. H is wrong.

Option I: Only activity, not sex or temperature. But I'm pretty sure sex does affect metabolism, and temperature affects energy expenditure too. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Only weight and height. I don't think that's all. Weight and height might play a role, but the question includes other factors. So J isn't right.

So the correct answer should be C. It's because each person's caloric needs are unique based on these factorsâ€”sex, activity, and environment. That makes sense because all these aspects influence metabolism and energy expenditure.

The correct answer is C. This is because each individual's caloric requirements are influenced by their sex, activity level, and environmental temperature. These factors affect metabolism and energy expenditure, making them essential considerations when estimating daily caloric needs.

Answer: C
