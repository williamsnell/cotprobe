Okay, so I've got this question about deindividuation and how it's been tested. Hmm, I remember that deindividuation has something to do with group behavior. Let me think. I think it's when people lose their sense of self and don't feel as responsible for their actions when they're in a group. Like, maybe they do things they wouldn't do alone because they feel anonymous.

Wait, so the question is asking what deindividuation is and how it's been tested. I'm trying to recall. I remember something about experiments where people were made to feel anonymous. Oh right, maybe the Stanford experiment or something with hoods or masks. Or wait, wasn't there an experiment where people were given hoods to wear so they couldn't be identified?

I think the concept is that when people are in groups, especially when anonymous, they lose their individual identities and their inhibitions. So they might engage in more impulsive or aggressive behavior. Like in riots or mob situations where people do things they normally wouldn't.

Looking at the options now. Option C says it's a state where a person feels a lessened sense of personal identity and decreased concern about others' opinions. That sounds right. Because when you're anonymous, you don't feel as accountable, so you're less concerned about what others think.

Other options: Option A says morality is enhanced, which doesn't fit because I remember deindividuation leading to decreased moral restraints. Option B talks about cognitive improvement due to anonymity, which doesn't seem right. Option D says more conscious about societal norms â€“ no, actually, they might ignore norms. Option E talks about conforming without anonymity, but deindividuation is more about being anonymous. Option F is increased self-awareness, which is the opposite. G is about losing critical thinking, which might be part of it but not the definition. H is about public image, which sounds more like the opposite. I is increased responsibility, which again is the opposite. J talks about heightened aggression and impulsivity, which is a result but not the definition itself.

So the definition is about losing personal identity and less concern for others' opinions. So option C. As for testing, I think experiments involved making people anonymous, like using hoods or masks, and observing behavior changes. So putting it together, the correct answer should be C.

Deindividuation refers to a state where individuals experience a diminished sense of personal identity and reduced concern about others' opinions, often leading to behaviors they might not exhibit when acting alone. This concept has been tested through experiments where participants were made anonymous, such as wearing hoods or masks, to observe changes in behavior, particularly increased impulsivity or aggression.

The correct answer is C.

Answer: C
