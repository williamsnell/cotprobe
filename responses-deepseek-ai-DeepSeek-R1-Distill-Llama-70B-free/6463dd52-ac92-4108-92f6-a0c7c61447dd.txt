Question:

Connie Computer decided to purchase a $1,000 laptop computer to use during law school. When she went into Computer Retailer Inc., the salesperson also sold her a 5-year service agreement for $1,200 for a total price of $2,200. Nine months later, the laptop stopped working and Computer Retailer refused to perform on their service agreement. If Connie sues Computer Retailer, the trial court will likely find for

Options:

A: Computer Retailer, under the UCC unless the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the service portion of the contract.
B: Connie, under the UCC unless the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.
C: Connie, under the common law unless the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the service portion of the contract.
D: Computer Retailer, only if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the contract was for the goods portion of the contract.
E: Connie, under the common law because the predominate purpose for which the parties contracted was the sale of goods.
F: Computer Retailer, if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement is determined by intent and not the relative dollars assigned to the computer and the service agreement.
G: Connie, under the UCC only if the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the goods portion of the contract.
H: Computer Retailer, under the common law if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.
I: Connie, if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement is determined by the relative dollars assigned to the computer and the service agreement.
J: Computer Retailer, if the court determines that the service agreement was not a significant part of the contract.

Okay, so I need to figure out this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically dealing with the UCC and common law. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The situation is that Connie bought a laptop for $1,000 and also purchased a 5-year service agreement for $1,200, making the total $2,200. Nine months later, the laptop breaks, and the retailer refuses to honor the service agreement. Connie is suing, and we need to determine who the court will likely rule for.

The question revolves around whether the contract is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or common law. I remember that the UCC applies to the sale of goods, while common law applies to services or other non-goods contracts. But when a contract involves both goods and services, we have to determine which part is predominant.

I think the key here is the "predominant purpose" test. The UCC applies if the predominant purpose of the contract is the sale of goods. If it's predominantly for services, then common law applies. So in this case, the contract includes both a laptop (goods) and a service agreement (services). 

Looking at the amounts: the laptop is $1,000, and the service is $1,200. So the service is more expensive. But is the predominant purpose based on the dollar amount, or is it based on the intent of the parties? I seem to recall that courts look more at the nature of the transaction rather than just the price. So even if the service costs more, the main purpose might still be the sale of the laptop. But wait, the service agreement is for five years, which is a significant portion of the contract's duration. That might indicate that the services were a major part.

Wait, but the UCC also considers whether the goods are the primary focus. For example, in cases where you buy a pizza with a coupon, the coupon is a service, but the main purpose is the food, so UCC applies. But in other cases, like when you hire someone to paint your house, even if they provide materials, the main purpose is the service, so common law applies.

In this problem, Connie is a law student buying a laptop, which is a good, and a service agreement. The service agreement is for five years, which is quite long. The laptop itself cost $1,000, and the service $1,200. So the service is 1200 vs 1000 for goods. But does that make it a service contract?

Wait, but the UCC applies to goods, and the service contract might be considered a separate part. Or is it part of the same contract? If the contract is for both goods and services, the predominant purpose determines the governing law.

I think the UCC would apply if the main reason Connie entered the contract was to buy the laptop, with the service agreement being an additional benefit. But if the service was the main reason, then common law applies.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Computer Retailer wins under UCC unless the predominant reason was service. But if it's under UCC, Connie would have certain remedies, like under warranty. If the service agreement is a service, maybe it's not covered by UCC.

Wait, the service agreement is a service contract, so maybe that's governed by common law, but the laptop sale is UCC. But the issue is whether the entire contract is governed by UCC or common law.

Wait, but the question is about a single contract that includes both goods and services. So the court would have to decide whether the predominant purpose is goods or services.

If the predominant purpose is goods, then UCC applies. If services, then common law.

So the options are considering whether the court decides for Connie or Computer Retailer based on this.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant purpose was service.

Option G: Connie wins under UCC only if goods were predominant.

So if the laptop (goods) is the predominant purpose, then UCC applies, and Connie can sue under that. If service is predominant, then common law applies, perhaps with different rules.

But wait, the question is about the service agreement. If the contract is governed by UCC, then the service agreement might be considered part of the goods contract, and breaches would be handled under UCC. But if it's under common law, perhaps as a service contract, maybe different rules apply, like stricter standards for breach.

In this case, Computer Retailer refused to perform the service agreement. So if the service agreement is part of a UCC-governed contract, Connie can claim breach under UCC. But if it's a service contract under common law, maybe she can still claim breach, but the remedies might differ.

Wait, but the question is asking who the trial court will find for, not the specific remedy. So the issue is whether the contract is governed by UCC or common law, which affects which set of rules apply. But if the service agreement is part of a UCC contract, then UCC rules about breach apply, and Connie might win. If it's under common law, perhaps the retailer's obligations are different, maybe more strict.

I think that if the predominant purpose is goods, then UCC applies, making the service part subject to UCC as part of the same transaction. So the retailer's failure to honor the service agreement would be a breach under UCC, and Connie would win.

But if the predominant purpose was service, then common law applies, but I'm not sure how that affects the outcome. Maybe under common law, the service agreement could be seen as a separate contract, but the retailer still has to perform unless there's a valid defense.

Wait, but Computer Retailer refused to perform without any given reason. So regardless of UCC or common law, they're in breach unless they have a valid defense. But the question is about whether the court finds for Connie or the retailer.

Wait, but the options are about under which law. So under UCC, Connie can recover for breach of the service agreement as part of the goods contract. If the contract is under common law, she can also recover, but perhaps under different standards.

Wait, but the question is about the trial court finding for who. So if the contract is governed by UCC, Connie would win because the service agreement is part of the goods contract. If it's under common law, perhaps the service agreement is a separate service contract, and the rules for service contracts may differ.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The key is the predominant purpose. If the contract's main purpose is goods (the laptop), then UCC applies, making the service part also under UCC. If the main purpose is service, then common law applies.

So the options:

Option B: Connie, under UCC unless predominant was service.

Option G: Connie, under UCC only if goods predominant.

Wait, so if the predominant purpose is goods, UCC applies, and Connie can sue under UCC. If predominant is service, then it's under common law, but then what happens? Does that mean the service agreement is a service contract, so perhaps warranties or other terms are different.

But the question is about who wins. If the contract is under UCC, the service agreement is part of the goods contract. If the retailer breaches, Connie wins. If it's under common law, it's a service contract, and the retailer still breached, so Connie still wins.

Wait, that can't be. Because if both laws lead to Connie winning, but the options suggest that it's conditional based on predominant purpose.

Wait, perhaps under UCC, there are implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for purpose, which might make it easier for Connie to prove breach. Under common law, perhaps the service agreement is treated differently, maybe under a different standard.

Alternatively, maybe the service agreement isn't covered by UCC if the predominant purpose is services. So if the predominant purpose is services, then the service agreement is under common law, and perhaps the retailer's obligations are different. But unless there's a valid reason to refuse service, the retailer is still in breach.

Wait, but the options are about who the court finds for, so perhaps the key is whether the UCC applies, giving Connie more protections. If the contract is under UCC, she can recover more easily, perhaps. If it's under common law, maybe the retailer has more defenses.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's look at the options again.

Option B says Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant purpose was service. So if the predominant is service, then the contract is under common law, and perhaps the outcome is different.

Option G says Connie wins under UCC only if goods were predominant. So if goods are predominant, she wins under UCC. If not, perhaps she doesn't win, meaning the retailer wins.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because even under common law, the retailer is in breach. So perhaps the issue is about whether the service agreement is part of the UCC contract or a separate service contract.

Alternatively, perhaps the service agreement is a separate contract, but the question states that it's a single contract for both goods and services.

Wait, the question says she purchased the laptop and the service agreement for a total of $2,200, so it's a single contract with both goods and services.

So the court must determine whether the predominant purpose is goods or services. If goods, UCC applies; if services, common law applies.

Now, if UCC applies, the service agreement is part of the goods contract, and the retailer's refusal to perform is a breach, so Connie wins. If common law applies, the service agreement is a service contract, and perhaps the retailer's obligations are different, but still, the refusal would be a breach, so Connie would win.

But that can't be right because the options suggest that the outcome depends on the predominant purpose. So perhaps under one of the regimes, the service agreement is not actionable.

Wait, maybe under common law, service contracts are not subject to the same implied warranties. Or perhaps the service agreement isn't covered by the same protections as under UCC.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is about what the court will decide in terms of the applicable law. If the contract is governed by UCC, then the service agreement is part of the sale, and the retailer's breach is clear. If it's under common law, perhaps the service agreement is treated as a separate contract, which might have its own terms, but the retailer still breached.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key is that under UCC, a breach of the service agreement (as part of the goods contract) would allow Connie to recover. Under common law, perhaps the service agreement is a separate contract, and the rules for breach are different, but the outcome might still be the same.

But the question is about which party the court will find for, so perhaps the answer depends on whether the predominant purpose is goods or services.

If the predominant purpose is goods, UCC applies, and Connie can sue for breach. If services, common law applies, but perhaps the service agreement is enforceable, so Connie still wins.

Wait, but that doesn't align with the options. Let me consider the options again.

Option B says Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant purpose was service. So if service is predominant, then under common law, perhaps the court doesn't find for her? That doesn't make sense because breach is breach regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps under common law, the service agreement might be considered a separate contract, and the retailer might have more defenses. But without more info, I can't say.

Alternatively, maybe the UCC has stricter rules about service agreements, making it more likely that Connie wins under UCC, but under common law, the retailer might have more defenses.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck because I'm not entirely sure about the implications of UCC vs. common law on the service agreement. Let me try a different approach.

The UCC applies to the sale of goods. If the service agreement is considered part of the goods contract, then UCC applies, and the failure to honor it is a breach. So Connie would win under UCC.

If the service agreement is the predominant purpose, then common law applies, and perhaps the service agreement is governed by common law rules, which may have different standards for breach. But even so, the retailer refusing to perform without cause is a breach.

Wait, but the options suggest that the outcome depends on the predominant purpose. So perhaps under common law, the service agreement isn't covered, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the service agreement is an enforceable contract under either law. But the issue is whether it's part of the same contract as the goods. So if under UCC, Connie can recover for breach of the service agreement as part of the goods contract. If under common law, perhaps the service agreement is a separate contract, but the outcome would still be in Connie's favor unless the retailer has a defense.

But the question is about whether the court finds for Connie or the retailer. So perhaps the key is that under UCC, the service agreement is part of the goods contract, making it easier for Connie to win, while under common law, it's a separate service contract, and perhaps the retailer has a different defense.

Alternatively, perhaps the UCC requires that the service agreement be honored as part of the goods sale, whereas under common law, the service agreement could be considered a separate and perhaps non-enforceable contract.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because service contracts are enforceable under common law. So perhaps the key is that under UCC, the service agreement is subject to the same rules as the goods, making it easier for Connie to prove breach, whereas under common law, the service agreement might have different terms, but the outcome is the same.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is likely B or G.

Option B: Connie, under UCC unless the predominant purpose was service.

Option G: Connie, under UCC only if goods were predominant.

So if the predominant purpose is goods, then UCC applies, and Connie wins. If it's services, then common law applies, and perhaps she doesn't win.

Wait, but why would she not win under common law? Because the service agreement is a separate contract, but the retailer still breached it.

Alternatively, perhaps under UCC, the service agreement is covered, but under common law, it's not, so the retailer isn't obligated. But that can't be right because the service agreement is a contract regardless.

Wait, perhaps the issue is about the statute of limitations or other procedural differences. But the question is about who the court finds for, not about procedural issues.

Alternatively, perhaps under common law, the service agreement is not considered part of the contract, so the retailer's refusal to perform isn't a breach of the same contract. But that doesn't make sense because the service agreement was part of the same contract.

I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should recall that the UCC's predominant purpose test says that if the contract is predominantly for goods, UCC applies. Otherwise, common law applies.

In this case, the laptop is $1,000, and the service is $1,200. So the service is more expensive. But the purpose might still be for the goods. Because the laptop is the primary item, and the service is to support it. So the predominant purpose is goods.

So the court would apply UCC, making the service agreement part of the goods contract. Therefore, the retailer's refusal is a breach under UCC, and Connie wins.

Looking at the options, option B says Connie wins under UCC unless predominant was service. So if predominant is service, then she doesn't win under UCC. But in our case, predominant is goods, so she wins under UCC.

Option G says Connie wins under UCC only if goods were predominant, which aligns with our conclusion.

Wait, but option B and G are similar. Let me read them again.

Option B: Connie, under UCC unless the predominant purpose was service.

Option G: Connie, under UCC only if goods were predominant.

So both options suggest that Connie wins under UCC when goods are predominant, but option B adds "unless service was predominant," implying that if service was predominant, she wouldn't win under UCC. But under common law, she might still win, but the option doesn't specify.

Wait, but the question is about who the court finds for. So if the contract is under UCC, Connie wins. If under common law, perhaps she also wins, but under a different legal theory.

But the options are about the basis of the decision. So the correct answer is that the court will find for Connie under UCC unless the predominant purpose was service, in which case it would be under common law, but she might still win.

Wait, but the options don't all go that way. Let me look again.

Option B: Connie, under UCC unless predominant was service.

So if predominant is service, then under common law, but the option doesn't say she loses; it just says the basis changes.

Wait, but the question is about the trial court finding for Connie or Computer Retailer. So if the contract is under UCC, Connie wins. If under common law, perhaps she still wins, but the option doesn't specify that. Alternatively, perhaps under common law, the service agreement is not enforceable, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps under UCC, the service agreement is enforceable as part of the goods contract, but under common law, it's a separate service contract, which might not be enforceable for some reason, like lack of consideration or something else. But that's not indicated here.

Wait, but the service agreement was paid for, so there's consideration. So under either law, the service agreement is enforceable. Therefore, Connie should win regardless, but the options don't present that.

Wait, perhaps the key is that under UCC, the service agreement is covered, so Connie can recover. Under common law, the service agreement is a separate contract, and perhaps the retailer has a defense, but in this case, they refused without cause, so she still wins.

But the options are about the court's decision based on UCC or common law.

I think I'm overcomplicating again. Let me try to make a decision.

The predominant purpose is likely goods because the laptop is the primary item, even though the service costs more. The service is to support the laptop, which is a good. So UCC applies, and Connie wins under UCC.

Looking at the options, option G says Connie wins under UCC only if goods were predominant. That aligns with this reasoning.

But option B says Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant was service. So if goods are predominant, she wins under UCC, which is correct.

Wait, but option B is phrased as "unless the predominant reason was service." So if the predominant is service, then the UCC doesn't apply, and she doesn't win under UCC. But she might still win under common law. However, the option doesn't say that.

The question is about the trial court finding for whom, so the answer would depend on whether the contract is governed by UCC or common law.

If the contract is under UCC, Connie wins. If under common law, she may or may not, but the options don't provide that nuance.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reasoning is that the sale of goods (laptop) is the predominant purpose,
