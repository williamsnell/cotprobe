Question:

A 17-year-old boy was jostling with his 12-year-old brother. A pedestrian witnessed the boy shoving his brother and mistakenly believed that they were fighting. Acting as a Good Samaritan, the pedestrian approached the boys and tried to intercede. The boy stumbled and accidentally fell into the pedestrian, knocking him to the ground. The pedestrian broke his arm as a result of the fall. If the pedestrian sues the boy to recover damages for his injury, he should

Options:

A: prevail, because the pedestrian reasonably believed that the boy was about to injure his brother.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's read through it again to make sure I understand the scenario.

So, there's a 17-year-old boy and his 12-year-old brother. They're jostling, which I think means they're play-fighting or something. A pedestrian sees them shoving each other and mistakenly thinks they're fighting. So, the pedestrian decides to step in as a Good Samaritan and tries to intercede. But then, the boy stumbles and accidentally falls into the pedestrian, knocking him down. The pedestrian breaks his arm because of the fall. Now, the pedestrian is suing the boy for damages. The question is, should he prevail?

The options are A through D. Let's go through each possible answer.

Option A says the pedestrian should prevail because he reasonably believed the boy was about to injure his brother. Hmm. Wait, but the boy was just jostling, which is horseplay. The pedestrian's belief was mistaken because it wasn't a real fight. So, does the boy's action constitute any kind of intentional tort towards the pedestrian? Or is this about negligence?

Option B suggests the pedestrian would win based on transferred intent. Transferred intent applies when someone intends to commit a tort against one person, but it actually affects another. For example, if I throw a rock at Alex, but hit Sam instead, the intent transfers. But in this case, did the boy have any intent to harm the pedestrian? No, he was just shoving his brother. When he stumbled, it was an accident. So maybe transferred intent doesn't apply here because there was no intentional act directed at the pedestrian.

Option C says the pedestrian can't win because he assumed the risk. Assumption of risk is a defense where the plaintiff voluntarily took on a known risk. But the pedestrian was trying to help, thinking there was a fight. Did he know the risk of getting injured? Maybe, but does that completely bar his claim? I'm not sure. Assumption of risk is more of a defense in cases of negligence, perhaps, but if the boy didn't do anything negligent, maybe that's not the main issue here.

Option D states the pedestrian won't prevail unless the boy was negligent. So, this is pointing towards a negligence claim. For negligence, you need duty, breach, causation, and damages. The boy was playing with his brother, which is a normal activity. Was he being unreasonable in his actions? If the pedestrian intervened in a situation that wasn't dangerous, maybe the boy's actions weren't negligent. Or perhaps the boy's action of shoving was a negligent act that accidentally caused harm to the pedestrian. 

Wait, but the boy didn't intend to harm the pedestrian. He accidentally fell into him. So, was the boy negligent in his actions? Maybe, but jostling with a sibling might not be considered negligent per se. Alternatively, maybe the act was not a breach of duty of care because it's reasonable horseplay. 

Alternatively, if the pedestrian overreacted or intervened in a situation that wasn't truly dangerous, could that mean that the boy isn't liable? Because the pedestrian's mistake led to the accident. But the pedestrian was acting in good faith as a Good Samaritan, so perhaps the boy's actions are still subject to scrutiny for negligence.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me break it down. The pedestrian's claim would likely be in tort. The possible torts here could be battery or negligence. Battery requires intentional harmful or offensive contact. But the boy didn't intend to contact the pedestrian; it was an accident. So battery doesn't apply.

So, the claim would probably be negligence. The boy had a duty to not cause harm to others. If his shoving was a negligent act, then the pedestrian's injury would be a result of that negligence. But if the boy was just engaging in normal play, perhaps there's no negligence.

Alternatively, the pedestrian's intervention was based on a mistake. If the situation wasn't dangerous, maybe the pedestrian should not have intervened, and thus the risk was on him. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but the boy's action caused the pedestrian's injury, but was it foreseeable? If the boy was shoving his brother, could he have reasonably foreseen that someone might try to intervene and get hurt? If so, then perhaps there's a duty of care, and the boy's action might be considered negligent.

But I'm not certain. Another angle is the concept of "Good Samaritan" laws, but those usually protect the Samaritan from liability when helping someone in an emergency. Here, the Samaritan is the plaintiff, so that's not directly applicable.

In terms of the options, option D says the pedestrian won't prevail unless the boy was negligent. So if the boy was not negligent, then the pedestrian can't recover. But if the boy's jostling was negligent, then the pedestrian could recover.

Wait, but the boy was just playing with his brother. Unless that play was so rough that it created a foreseeable risk to others nearby, including someone intervening. So, perhaps the boy's actions were negligent.

But in this case, the pedestrian mistakenly thought they were fighting. So, the boy's actions were towards his brother, not the pedestrian. The question is whether the boy's actions were negligent towards the pedestrian.

I'm a bit torn. Option D says unless the boy was negligent, the pedestrian doesn't prevail. So, if the boy's action was not negligent, the pedestrian loses.

Alternatively, in the scenario, the pedestrian's injury was a result of the boyâ€™s action, which was a stumble. So, the boy didn't intend to hurt the pedestrian, but was his action negligent?

If the boy was being negligent in shoving his brother in a way that could cause a third party to be injured when they tried to intervene, then perhaps. But that seems like a stretch because the intervention was based on a mistake.

Alternatively, the pedestrian's mistake doesn't absolve the boy of negligence if the boy's actions were indeed negligent.

Wait, but if the boy was just horseplaying with his brother, that's not inherently negligent. So, the pedestrian's injury might be a result of an accident, but unless the boy was negligent, the pedestrian can't recover. So, the answer would be D: the pedestrian doesn't prevail unless the boy was negligent.

But wait, another point: the boy's actions (shoving his brother) led to him losing balance and falling into the pedestrian. So, perhaps the boy wasn't being careful, and his action was negligent because it was foreseeable that someone might try to step in, especially if they appeared to be fighting. Hmm, but is that a reasonable foreseeability? Maybe not, because the pedestrian's intervention was based on a mistake.

I think the key here is that for the pedestrian to recover, the boy must have been negligent. If the boy wasn't negligent, then the pedestrian can't recover. So, the answer is D: not prevail unless the boy was negligent.

Another thought: the boy's action might be considered a battery towards his brother, but that's not relevant here. The pedestrian's injury was accidental, so unless the boy's actions towards his brother were negligent, the pedestrian can't recover.

So, I think the correct answer is D.

The question revolves around whether the pedestrian can recover damages from the 17-year-old boy after being injured during an attempted intervention in a mistaken belief that the boy and his brother were fighting. The analysis focuses on the legal theories of negligence, transferred intent, and assumption of risk.

1. **Option A**: The pedestrian's mistaken belief that the boy was about to injure his brother does not create liability for the boy. The boy was merely jostling with his brother, and the pedestrian's belief was unreasonable. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: Transferred intent applies when an intentional act toward one person affects another. Here, the boy had no intent to harm the pedestrian, and the contact was accidental. Thus, transferred intent does not apply, making this option incorrect.

3. **Option C**: Assumption of risk is a defense where the plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily accepts a known risk. While the pedestrian intervened voluntarily, assumption of risk is not the primary issue here. The focus is on whether the boy was negligent, not whether the pedestrian assumed the risk.

4. **Option D**: The pedestrian's recovery hinges on whether the boy was negligent. For negligence, the boy must have breached a duty of care, and his actions must have foreseeably caused harm. While the boy was jostling with his brother, this is a normal activity unless it was so rough as to create a foreseeable risk to others. The pedestrian's injury resulted from an accidental stumble, and the boy's actions were not inherently negligent. Therefore, the pedestrian cannot recover unless negligence is established.

The correct answer is **D**, as the pedestrian cannot prevail unless the boy's actions are deemed negligent.

**Answer: D**
