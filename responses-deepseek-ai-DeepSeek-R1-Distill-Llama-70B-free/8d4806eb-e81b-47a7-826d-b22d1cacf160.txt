Okay, so I've got this problem here about graph theory and Ramsey numbers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Ramsey theory, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about coloring the edges of a complete graph with n vertices using two colors, red and blue. We need to find the smallest n such that there's either a red triangle or a blue 6-clique. The options are from A to J, with numbers ranging from 15 to 25.

Alright, I remember that Ramsey numbers, R(s, t), are the smallest numbers such that any graph of that size will contain either a red clique of size s or a blue clique of size t. So in this case, we're looking for R(3,6).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says either a red triangle (which is a 3-clique) or a blue 6-clique. So yes, exactly R(3,6). So I need to find the Ramsey number R(3,6).

But wait, I thought Ramsey numbers are tricky. Do I remember any specific values? I know that R(3,3) is 6, because in any 2-coloring of K6, you'll have a monochromatic triangle. But when the numbers get bigger, it's harder.

I think the general approach for Ramsey numbers uses recursive formulas or known bounds. Let me try to recall. I remember that R(s,t) is the smallest n such that R(s-1,t) and R(s,t-1) are less than n, but I'm not sure how that helps exactly.

Wait, maybe I should look for known Ramsey numbers. I think R(3,6) is a known value. From what I vaguely remember, R(3,6) is 18. But I'm not certain. Let me think deeper.

Alternatively, I can approach it step by step. Ramsey's theorem tells us that for any given integers s and t, such a number exists, but calculating it exactly is tough. Let's see if I can find a way to compute R(3,6).

I think there's a way to use the concept of Ramsey numbers for smaller graphs and build up. For example, I know that R(s,t) ≤ R(s-1,t) + R(s,t-1). But I'm not sure if that's the exact formula.

Wait, no, that's for the recursive upper bound. The exact formula is actually not straightforward. So perhaps for R(3,6), I can use known values.

Wait, I think R(3,5) is 14, and R(3,6) is 18. Let me think why. Because each time you increase t by 1, you might add 3 or 4 to the previous Ramsey number.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the pigeonhole principle. Each edge is colored red or blue. For a given vertex, say v, it has n-1 edges. Each edge is either red or blue. If v has at least 5 red edges, then maybe we can form a red triangle. Or if it has many blue edges, perhaps leading to a blue 6-clique.

Wait, perhaps using induction or recursive reasoning. Let's consider the structure of the graph. Suppose we pick a vertex v. The edges from v to the other n-1 vertices are either red or blue. Let's say v has k red edges and (n-1 -k) blue edges.

If k is at least 5, then among those k vertices, if any two are connected by a red edge, we get a red triangle (v and those two). If not, then those k vertices form a blue clique of size k. So if k is 5, then among those 5, if any edge is red, we have a triangle. If not, they're all blue, so a blue K5, but we need a blue K6. So maybe that's not enough.

Alternatively, perhaps if v has more than a certain number of blue edges. Let's say v has at least 5 blue edges. Then among those 5, if any edge is blue, then together with v, they form a blue K4, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the minimal n where either there's a red triangle or a blue K6. I think R(3,6)=18. So the minimal n is 18, which would make option I the correct answer.

But wait, how to be more precise. Let's think about what R(s,t) means. It's the smallest n such that any 2-coloring of K_n contains a red K_s or a blue K_t.

So R(3,6) is the smallest n where any red/blue coloring of K_n has either a red triangle or a blue 6-clique.

I think I remember that R(3,6) is 18. Let me check if that makes sense.

Wait, another approach: using the formula R(s,t) ≥ R(s-1,t) + R(s,t-1). But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, perhaps using known Ramsey numbers. Let me see: R(3,3)=6, R(3,4)=9, R(3,5)=14, R(3,6)=18. Yes, that seems to fit a pattern where each time t increases by 1, the Ramsey number increases by 3 or 4.

So if R(3,5)=14, then R(3,6)=18. Because to get from 14 to 18, adding 4 each time t increases by 1.

So the answer should be 18, which is option I.

The problem involves determining the smallest number \( n \) such that any 2-coloring (red and blue) of the edges of a complete graph \( K_n \) guarantees either a red triangle (3-clique) or a blue 6-clique. This is a classic Ramsey number problem, specifically finding \( R(3,6) \), which is the smallest \( n \) for which any red-blue edge coloring of \( K_n \) contains either a red \( K_3 \) or a blue \( K_6 \).

Ramsey numbers are known to be challenging to compute, but some values and bounds are established. For example:
- \( R(3,3) = 6 \), meaning any 2-coloring of \( K_6 \) contains a monochromatic triangle.
- \( R(3,4) = 9 \), \( R(3,5) = 14 \), and \( R(3,6) = 18 \), following a pattern where the Ramsey number increases as the size of the cliques increases.

Using this pattern, \( R(3,6) = 18 \) is the smallest \( n \) such that any red-blue edge coloring of \( K_n \) guarantees either a red triangle or a blue 6-clique. This aligns with the problem's requirements.

Thus, the correct answer is **I: 18**.
