Question:

The predominant cell type infected by HIV is CD4^+ cells. The mostimportant of these are the T-helper cells. (Review the immunogeneticschapter for a description of T_H-cells.) As the diseaseprogresses through latency into AIDS-related complexand finally full-blown AIDS, the absolute number of CD4^+ cells (i.e., T_H-cells) decreases.The rate of T_H-cell deletionincreases as the patient enters ARC. As the number ofT_H-cells decreases, the ratio of CD4^+ to CD8^+ cells inverts, goingfrom about 2:1 to less than 1:2. Why is the T_H-cell sucha devastating target ?

Options:

A: T_H-cells are auxiliary cells that enhance the phagocytic function of macrophages without affecting lymphocytes.
B: T_H-cells are necessary for the proper functioning of the specific immune system, that is, for cytotoxic T-cells (T_c) and most B-cells.
C: T_H-cells are necessary for the functioning of only B-cells
D: T_H-cells are primarily involved in the production of mucus as a barrier against pathogens.
E: T_H-cells are the primary cell type that produces histamine in response to allergens.
F: T_H-cells are necessary for the maintenance of the skin's barrier function.
G: T_H-cells are only involved in the initial recognition of pathogens, without influencing the adaptive immune response.
H: T_H-cells are necessary for the functioning of non-specific immune system
I: T_H-cells are responsible for the production of antibodies against only non-pathogenic antigens.
J: T_H-cells are not necessary for the immune system

Okay, so I've got this question about HIV and T helper cells. I'm a bit rusty on my immunology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking why T helper cells (T_H cells) are such a devastating target for HIV. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

I remember that T helper cells, which are CD4+ cells, play a big role in the immune system. They help activate other immune cells. Without them, the immune system can't function properly.

Looking at the options:

Option A says T_H cells enhance macrophages' phagocytic function but don't affect lymphocytes. Wait, I thought T_H cells do help B cells and cytotoxic T cells. So this might not be the best answer.

Option B states that T_H cells are necessary for the specific immune system, like for cytotoxic T cells and most B cells. That rings a bell. Because without T_H cells, B cells can't be activated to produce antibodies properly, and cytotoxic T cells also need their help. That would make sense why losing them is bad.

Option C says they're only needed for B cells. I think it's more than that. They also help T cytotoxic cells, so C might be too narrow.

Option D mentions mucus production. No, that's more of a barrier like in mucosal surfaces, not T_H cells.

Option E is about histamine and allergies. That's probably mast cells, not T_H cells.

Option F talks about skin barrier function. I don't recall T_H cells being directly involved in that. Skin is more of a physical barrier.

Option G says they're involved in the initial recognition without influencing adaptive response. No, T_H cells are part of the adaptive immune system. They help with recognizing antigens and activating other cells.

Option H says they're needed for the non-specific immune system. Wait, non-specific is the innate immune system, like macrophages and such. T_H cells are part of the adaptive (specific) immune system, so H might be incorrect.

Option I says they produce antibodies against non-pathogenic antigens. No, B cells produce antibodies, and T_H cells help them. Also, antibodies are against any antigens, not just non-pathogenic.

Option J says T_H cells aren't necessary. That's definitely wrong because without them, the immune system collapses, leading to AIDS.

So putting it together, the correct answer is B. T_H cells are crucial for both T_c cells (cytotoxic) and most B cells, so their loss paralyzes the specific immune response, making the person vulnerable to infections.

The T-helper (T_H) cells, also known as CD4+ cells, are a critical component of the adaptive immune system. They play a central role in activating and coordinating the responses of other immune cells, such as cytotoxic T cells (T_c) and B cells. Without T_H cells, cytotoxic T cells cannot effectively target and destroy infected cells, and B cells cannot be properly activated to produce antibodies. This makes T_H cells indispensable for the proper functioning of the specific immune system. Their depletion by HIV leads to a severe impairment of immune function, resulting in the progression to AIDS. Among the given options, the one that accurately reflects the importance of T_H cells is:

**B: T_H-cells are necessary for the proper functioning of the specific immune system, that is, for cytotoxic T-cells (T_c) and most B-cells.**

Answer: B
