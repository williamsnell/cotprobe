Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Williams and his dividends. Hmm, I need to figure out how much he receives in total dividends. Let me read the question again.

He owns 75 shares of Mid-Atlantic common stock, and each share pays a dividend of $0.35. Then, he also has 135 shares of their 5% $50 par-value preferred stock. I remember that preferred stock dividends are calculated based on the par value and the percentage rate.

So, first, I should calculate the dividend from the common stock. That's straightforward. For each share, it's $0.35, and he has 75 shares. So 75 multiplied by 0.35. Let me do that math. 75 * 0.35 equals... let's see, 70*0.35 is 24.5, and 5*0.35 is 1.75, so total is 26.25. So that's $26.25 from the common stock.

Now, the preferred stock part. He has 135 shares, each with a par value of $50 and a 5% dividend. Wait, how do I calculate that? Oh right, preferred stock dividends are usually a fixed percentage of the par value. So for each share, it's 5% of $50. Let me compute that. 5% of 50 is 0.05 * 50 = $2.50 per share.

Since he has 135 shares, I multiply 2.50 by 135. Let's break that down. 100 shares would give 250, right? 35 shares would be 35 * 2.50 = 87.50. So adding those together, 250 + 87.50 equals 337.50. So the preferred stock dividends are $337.50.

Now, add both amounts together. Common stock gives $26.25, preferred gives $337.50. So 26.25 + 337.50 equals 363.75.

Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 75 * 0.35, yes, that's 26.25. 5% of 50 is 2.50, 135 *2.50= 337.5. Adding them gives 26.25 + 337.5 = 363.75.

Looking at the options, option H is $363.75. So I think that's the correct answer.

To determine the total dividends Mr. Williams receives, we calculate the dividends from both the common stock and the preferred stock separately and then sum them.

1. **Common Stock Dividends**:  
   Mr. Williams owns 75 shares of common stock, with each share paying a dividend of $0.35.  
   Total dividends from common stock:  
   \[
   75 \times 0.35 = 26.25
   \]

2. **Preferred Stock Dividends**:  
   Mr. Williams owns 135 shares of 5% $50 par-value preferred stock. The dividend per share is calculated as:  
   \[
   5\% \times 50 = 0.05 \times 50 = 2.50
   \]  
   Total dividends from preferred stock:  
   \[
   135 \times 2.50 = 337.50
   \]

3. **Total Dividends**:  
   Adding the dividends from both the common and preferred stock:  
   \[
   26.25 + 337.50 = 363.75
   \]

Thus, the total dividends Mr. Williams receives are **$363.75**, which corresponds to option **H**.
