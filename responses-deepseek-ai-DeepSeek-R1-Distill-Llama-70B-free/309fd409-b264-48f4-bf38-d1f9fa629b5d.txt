Question:

A defendant is on trial for robbery. The defendant's attorney plans to call a witness. Nine years earlier, the witness had been convicted of misdemeanor battery. The defendant's attorney has filed a motion disallowing the prosecution from questioning the witness regarding this prior conviction. The motion will likely be

Options:

A: denied, because the conviction is relevant to the witness's credibility

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence law question. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a defendant on trial for robbery. The defendant's attorney is planning to call a witness. This witness had a misdemeanor battery conviction nine years earlier. The attorney has filed a motion to prevent the prosecution from bringing up this prior conviction when questioning the witness. The question is whether the motion will be granted or denied.

Hmm, I remember that when it comes to witness credibility, prior convictions can be used to impeach the witness. But there are rules about what convictions can be used and how old they can be.

So, the main issue here is whether the prosecution can use a 9-year-old misdemeanor battery conviction to attack the witness's credibility. I think the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) have something about this. Let me recall.

Under FRE 609, evidence of a witness's conviction can be used to attack their credibility if the crime was punishable by more than a year, or it's a crime of dishonesty. But wait, the crime here is misdemeanor battery, which I think is punishable by less than a year, so it's a misdemeanor. So does that mean it's not admissible under 609?

Wait, but FRE 609(b) says that if the conviction is more than 10 years old, it can't be used unless it's a crime of dishonesty. But this conviction is 9 years old, so it's within the 10-year window. However, since it's a misdemeanor, maybe it's treated differently.

Wait, no. FRE 609(a) says that for crimes punishable by more than a year, you can use the conviction regardless of the time, but if it's a crime of dishonesty, even if it's more than 10 years, it can still be used. But for other crimes, like misdemeanors, the general rule is that if the crime is more than 10 years old, you can't use it. But here, it's only 9 years old, so maybe it's still admissible.

But wait, the motion is from the defense, trying to prevent the prosecution from using it. So the defense is arguing that the prior conviction shouldn't be used to impeach their witness. So the court would have to decide whether the prosecution can bring it up.

I think the critical point is that under FRE 609, the conviction can be used if it's less than 10 years old, regardless of whether it's a felony or misdemeanor, as long as the crime is punishable by more than a year. But wait, misdemeanor battery isn't punishable by more than a year, so maybe it's not covered under 609 at all. Or am I mixing things up?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. FRE 609(a)(1) says that evidence of a conviction can be admitted if the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment over one year, and the conviction is less than 10 years old. But if the crime is a misdemeanor, which is punishable by less than a year, then 609(a)(1) wouldn't apply. So, can the prosecution still use it?

Alternatively, I think that for misdemeanors, the court has discretion under FRE 403 to exclude evidence if the probative value is substantially outweighed by prejudice. So even if the conviction is admissible under 609, the court can still exclude it if it's too prejudicial.

Wait, but in this case, the witness is for the defense. So the prosecution wants to impeach the defense's witness. The defense is trying to prevent that by filing a motion. So the prosecution would argue that the conviction is relevant to the witness's credibility, thus it's admissible under 609 if it's within 10 years. But since it's a misdemeanor, maybe it's not covered under 609.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me break it down.

FRE 609(a) says that evidence of a conviction can be used to attack credibility if:

1. The crime was punishable by death or imprisonment over one year, and
2. The conviction is less than 10 years old.

But if the crime is a misdemeanor, which is less than a year, then the first part isn't met. So the conviction can't be used under 609(a)(1). But wait, there's another part: 609(a)(2) deals with crimes of dishonesty, regardless of the punishment, but those can be used even if more than 10 years have passed if the court decides it's more probative than prejudicial.

So since battery isn't a crime of dishonesty, 609(a)(2) doesn't apply. Therefore, the prior misdemeanor conviction can't be used under 609 to impeach the witness's credibility.

Wait, but I think there's another rule. FRE 405 allows attacking credibility with specific instances of conduct, but generally, prior convictions are handled under 609. So if 609 doesn't allow it, then the prosecution can't bring it up.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Some jurisdictions might have different rules, but under the federal rules, I think that misdemeanors not involving dishonesty can't be used under 609 if they're over a certain age. But here, it's 9 years old, which is under 10. But since it's a misdemeanor, 609(a)(1) doesn't apply because the punishment is less than a year.

So, in that case, the prosecution can't use the prior conviction to impeach the witness because it doesn't meet the criteria under 609. Therefore, the court would grant the motion, preventing the prosecution from questioning the witness about the prior conviction.

Wait, but some sources say that for misdemeanors, the 10-year rule doesn't apply in the same way. Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, perhaps the court can still allow it under 403, but the defense is moving to exclude it, arguing that the prejudice outweighs the probative value.

Wait, but if the conviction isn't admissible under 609, then the prosecution can't use it at all, regardless of 403. So the defense's motion would be granted because the prior conviction isn't admissible under 609. Alternatively, if it's admissible, then the court may weigh 403, but the question is whether the motion will be granted.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: Denied, because the conviction is relevant to credibility. But if 609 doesn't allow it, then it's not relevant for that purpose. So the motion would be granted.

Option B: Denied, because any party can attack credibility. But the rules limit that; it's not that any conviction can be used.

Option C: Granted, because prejudice outweighs probative value. That could be, but only if the evidence is admissible. If it's not admissible under 609, then it's excluded regardless.

Option G: Denied because less than 10 years. But that applies only if the conviction is under 609(a)(1), which requires the crime to be punishable by over a year. Here, it's a misdemeanor, so G might not apply.

Wait, the question is about whether the motion is granted or denied. The defense's motion is to prevent the prosecution from using the prior conviction. So if the prior conviction can be used under 609, the motion is denied. If it can't, the motion is granted.

So, is the prior conviction usable under 609? Since it's a misdemeanor battery, which is not punishable by more than a year, 609(a)(1) doesn't apply. So the prosecution can't use it under 609. Therefore, the court would grant the defense's motion to exclude it.

Wait, but some sources say that in some cases, even misdemeanors can be used if they are crimes of moral turpitude, but I think that's more for immigration purposes. Under FRE, I think it's specifically about the punishment and whether it's a crime of dishonesty.

So the correct answer would be that the motion is granted because the prior conviction isn't admissible under 609. Looking at the options, option C says granted because prejudice outweighs probative value. Option I says granted because it's not related to the current case. Option E is granted as a matter of right.

Wait, but if the evidence isn't admissible under 609, then the court must exclude it, so the motion would be granted as a matter of law, not just because of prejudice. So perhaps option E says granted as a matter of right, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, no. Because 609(a)(1) requires the crime to be punishable by more than a year. Since this is a misdemeanor, it's not. So the prosecution can't use it under 609. Therefore, the court would grant the defense's motion, so the answer would be option C or E or I.

Option C says granted because prejudice outweighs probative value. But actually, the reason is that it's not admissible under 609, so the motion would be granted. So perhaps the correct answer is G: denied because less than 10 years. Wait, no, because the crime doesn't meet the other criteria.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

If the prior conviction is a misdemeanor, then under 609(a)(1), it's only admissible if the crime is punishable by more than a year, which it's not. So the prosecution can't use it under 609(a)(1). Therefore, the witness's prior conviction can't be used to impeach credibility, so the defense's motion to prevent the prosecution from questioning about it would be granted. So the answer is that the motion is granted.

Looking at the options, option C is granted because prejudice outweighs. But I think the reason is that it's inadmissible under 609, not necessarily because of 403. Alternatively, if the evidence is inadmissible, the court doesn't need to reach 403. So maybe the correct reasoning is that the conviction isn't admissible under 609, so it's excluded.

But the options don't have an option that says "granted because it's inadmissible under 609". So I need to pick the best option.

Looking at the options:

A: Denied, because relevant to credibility. But since 609 doesn't allow it, it's not relevant for impeachment.

B: Denied, any party can attack. No, because the rules restrict it.

C: Granted, prejudice outweighs. This might be the case if the evidence was admissible but the court excludes it under 403.

E: Granted as a matter of right. Maybe if the evidence is inadmissible, it's excluded as a matter of law.

G: Denied because less than 10 years. But since the crime doesn't meet 609(a)(1), G is incorrect.

So, considering all this, the motion would be granted because the prior conviction isn't admissible under 609(a)(1). So the answer might be option C or E.

Wait, option E says granted as a matter of right. Does that apply here? I think if the evidence is inadmissible, the court must exclude it. So perhaps the motion is granted as a matter of right.

Alternatively, some might argue that the court has discretion, but I think in this case, since the prior conviction isn't admissible under 609, the motion would be granted. So the correct answer is E or C.

Wait, but option C says granted because prejudice outweighs. But the defense's motion is based on the inadmissibility, not on prejudice. So perhaps the better answer is E: granted as a matter of right.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me check the options again.

Option C: granted because prejudice outweighs. So that's a 403 balancing.

Option E: granted as a matter of right. Which would mean that it's inadmissible under 609, so the court has no choice but to grant the motion.

So in this case, since the prior conviction can't be used under 609, the court must grant the motion. So the answer would be E.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is to think that the prior conviction is a misdemeanor, so under 609, it's not admissible. Therefore, the court would grant the motion, making the answer E.

Alternatively, some might think that since it's less than 10 years, it's admissible, so the motion is denied, which would be option G. But wait, option G says denied because less than 10 years. But under 609(a)(1), the crime must be punishable by more than a year. Since it's a misdemeanor, that doesn't apply, so G's reasoning is flawed.

So the correct answer is E: granted as a matter of right.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Because sometimes, even if the conviction is inadmissible under 609, the prosecution might have another way to attack credibility, but I don't think so. So the motion would be granted because the prior conviction isn't admissible under 609, making option E correct.

Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the best answer is E.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the prosecution can use a 9-year-old misdemeanor battery conviction to impeach a defense witness's credibility. Under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 609, prior convictions can be used to attack credibility if the crime was punishable by more than one year or if it involves dishonesty. Since misdemeanor battery is punishable by less than a year and does not involve dishonesty, it does not meet the criteria under FRE 609(a)(1) or 609(a)(2). Therefore, the prior conviction is inadmissible for impeachment purposes.

The defense's motion seeks to prevent the prosecution from questioning the witness about this conviction. Since the conviction does not qualify under FRE 609, the court would grant the motion as a matter of law, excluding the evidence. This is not a discretionary decision based on prejudice outweighing probative value under FRE 403, but rather a mandatory exclusion because the conviction is inadmissible under the specific criteria of FRE 609.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The conviction is not relevant to credibility under FRE 609.  
- **B**: Incorrect. While any party can attack credibility, the rules restrict the use of prior convictions.  
- **C**: Incorrect. The motion is granted not because prejudice outweighs probative value, but because the conviction is inadmissible under FRE 609.  
- **D**: Incorrect. The fact that the conviction is public record does not make it admissible for impeachment.  
- **E**: Correct. The motion is granted as a matter of right because the conviction is inadmissible under FRE 609.  
- **F**: Incorrect. There is no indication the motion was untimely filed.  
- **G**: Incorrect. The 10-year rule applies only to convictions punishable by more than one year, which does not apply here.  
- **H**: Incorrect. The witness's past conviction is irrelevant to the defendant's case, but this is not the legal basis for excluding it.  
- **I**: Incorrect. The motion is granted because the conviction is inadmissible under FRE 609, not because it is unrelated to the current case.

The correct answer is **E**: granted as a matter of right, because the prior conviction is inadmissible under FRE 609. 

Answer: E
