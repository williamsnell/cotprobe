Okay, so I've got this question here about different types of memory. Hmm, I remember that memory is divided into various categories, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact terms. Let me think through this.

The question is asking which type of memory handles the recall of information from the past few hours to days. The options are A through I, each a different term. 

I remember that there's short-term and long-term memory. Short-term is for things we hold onto for a short period, like seconds or minutes. But wait, the question mentions a few hours to days, so maybe it's not exactly short-term. Or is there another category?

Wait, I think there's something called working memory. I've heard that term before. Working memory is part of the short-term memory system, right? It's where we temporarily hold information we're actively using, like when you're trying to solve a problem. So, if you need to remember something for a few hours, like where you put your keys this morning, that might fall under working memory.

Looking at the options, option D is working. That seems to fit. But let me go through the others to make sure.

Option A is episodic memory. That's part of long-term memory, specifically about personal experiences and events. Like remembering what you did yesterday. Episodic is a subset of declarative memory, right? So that's more long-term than a few hours.

Option B is declarative memory, which includes both episodic and semantic memory. Declarative is about facts and information, like knowing the capital of a country. But again, that's long-term because it's stored information.

Option C is semantic memory, which is another subset of declarative. It's about general knowledge. So not the right choice here.

Option E is echoic memory, which is a type of sensory memory related to auditory information. Like remembering a sound for a few seconds after it stops. But the time frame here is longer than that, so E doesn't fit.

Option F is sensory memory, which is the very brief storage of information from the senses, like iconic memory for visual info. So this is only for a split second, not hours or days.

Option G is prospective memory, which is about remembering to do something in the future, like appointments. It's a type of memory but doesn't fit the time frame of the question.

Option H is implicit memory, which is about unconscious memories, like skills and habits. You don't actively recall them, they just influence your actions. So that's not it.

Option I is long-term memory. While the information might eventually be stored there, the question is about the aspect that's involved in the recall within hours to days. So I think working memory is more immediate than long-term, which is for longer periods.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: Working.

The question asks which type of memory is involved in recalling information acquired within the past few hours to days. To determine the correct answer, it's essential to analyze each option:

- **Episodic Memory (A):** This is a subset of long-term memory that involves recalling personal experiences, such as events from the past. It is not limited to the time frame of hours to days.  
- **Declarative Memory (B):** This includes both episodic and semantic memory and refers to the storage of factual information. It is a form of long-term memory.  
- **Semantic Memory (C):** A subset of declarative memory that deals with general knowledge, such as facts and concepts. This is also long-term.  
- **Working Memory (D):** This is the aspect of memory that temporarily holds and manipulates information for cognitive tasks, such as problem-solving. It operates over short periods, such as hours to days, making it the most appropriate choice.  
- **Echoic Memory (E):** A type of sensory memory specific to auditory information, lasting only a few seconds.  
- **Sensory Memory (F):** Refers to the brief storage of sensory information, such as visual or auditory inputs, lasting only a fraction of a second.  
- **Prospective Memory (G):** Involves remembering to perform future tasks, which is not directly related to the time frame in question.  
- **Implicit Memory (H):** Unconscious memories, such as skills and habits, which are not actively recalled.  
- **Long-term Memory (I):** Refers to information stored over an extended period, beyond a few days.  

Given the time frame of hours to days and the need for active recall, **working memory** is the correct answer.  

Answer: D
