Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the net price of a bed after two discounts. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The bed is list-priced at $300, and it's being discounted first by 30%, then by 20%. I need to find the final price after both discounts. Wait, how do discounts stack? Do I subtract them one after the other, or combine them somehow?

So, the first discount is 30%. That means the bed is being sold at 70% of the original price after the first discount. Because 100% minus 30% is 70%. So, 70% of $300 is... let me calculate that. 0.7 times 300 equals 210. So after the first discount, the price is $210.

Now, the second discount is 20%. But does this 20% apply to the original price or the already discounted price? I think it's applied to the discounted price because that's how discounts usually work when applied successively. So the second discount is 20% off of $210.

Wait, so 20% of 210 is... 0.2 times 210, which is 42. So if I subtract that from 210, that gives me 210 - 42 = 168. So the final price should be $168.

Looking at the options, option G is $168. So I think the correct answer is G.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. Starting price is $300. 30% off means you pay 70%, so 0.7*300=210. Then 20% off on 210. 20% of 210 is 42. Subtract that and you get 168. Yep, that seems right.

Another way to think about it is to multiply the two discount factors. So first discount leaves 70%, second leaves 80%. So 0.7 * 0.8 = 0.56. Then 0.56 times 300 is 168. Same result. So definitely, it's $168.

The bed is initially priced at $300. After a 30% discount, the price becomes 70% of $300, which is:

\[
0.7 \times 300 = 210
\]

Next, a 20% discount is applied to the new price of $210. This means the customer pays 80% of $210:

\[
0.8 \times 210 = 168
\]

Thus, the net price of the bed after both discounts is $168. The correct answer is:

G: $168
