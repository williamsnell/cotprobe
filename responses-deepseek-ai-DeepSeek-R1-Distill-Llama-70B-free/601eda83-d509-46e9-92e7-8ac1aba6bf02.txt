Okay, so I've got this problem about Mr. Brown's commission, and I need to figure out how much he earns when he sells $1,200,000 worth of goods. Hmm, let's break it down.

Alright, first, I remember that he gets a 1% commission on all his sales. So for every dollar he sells, he gets 1 cent. That's straightforward. But wait, there's an additional commission for sales above a million. Oh right, an extra 1 and a half percent on anything over $1,000,000.

So the total commission must be split into two parts: the first part is the base commission up to a million, and the second part is the extra on the amount beyond a million. Let me think about how to calculate each part.

First part: 1% of $1,000,000. Let me calculate that. 1% of a million is 0.01 * 1,000,000 = $10,000. Okay, that's the base commission.

Now, the sale is $1,200,000, which is $200,000 over a million. So the second part is 1.5% of $200,000. Wait, 1.5% is the same as 1 and a half percent, which is 0.015 in decimal. So 0.015 * 200,000 = ?

Let me compute that. 200,000 times 0.015. Hmm, 200,000 * 0.01 is 2,000. So 0.005 is half of that, which is 1,000. So 2,000 + 1,000 is 3,000. So the additional commission is $3,000.

Wait, wait a second. Is the additional commission 1.5% on top of the 1%? So the total commission is 1% on the first million and 2.5% (1% +1.5%) on the amount over a million? Or is it just the additional 1.5% on the excess?

Oh, the question says he receives an additional 1.5% on all sales above $1,000,000. So that means that the first million is at 1%, and the part above million is at 1% +1.5% = 2.5%. Wait, no, wait. The base is 1% on everything. Then, for anything above a million, he gets an extra 1.5%. So the commission structure is two-tiered.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me read it again. "He receives an additional 1(1/2)% on all of his sales above $1,000,000." So this is on top of the regular 1%. So for the amount beyond a million, he gets 1% plus 1.5%, which is 2.5% total on that portion.

Wait, but the way it's worded, the additional is 1.5% only on the sales above a million. So perhaps the total for the amount above a million is 1% (base) plus 1.5% (additional). So that's 2.5% on the excess.

So let me recalculate. The first million is at 1%, which is $10,000. The remaining $200,000 is at 2.5%, which is 0.025 * 200,000 = $5,000. So the total commission would be 10,000 + 5,000 = $15,000. Hmm, but wait, that's not matching some of the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options: option C is $15,000. So that's one possibility. But wait, another way to think about it is that the 1.5% is only on the excess. So perhaps the base is 1% on everything, and then 1.5% on the part over a million.

Wait, that would make the first part 1% of 1,200,000, which is $12,000, and then the additional 1.5% on 200,000, which is $3,000. So total would be 15,000 again. So same result.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options. Option C is $15,000, which would be the correct answer. But wait, I'm a bit confused because another way to think about it is that perhaps the 1.5% is in addition to the 1%, so the commission is 1% on all sales plus an extra 1.5% only on the part over a million. So that would be 1% on all plus 1.5% on the excess.

So for the entire 1,200,000, 1% is 12,000, and 1.5% of 200,000 is 3,000. So total 15,000. So that's the same as before.

Wait, but another possible way is that for the first million, it's 1%, and for the part above, it's 1% plus 1.5% (so 2.5%). So that would be 10,000 (1% of million) plus 5,000 (2.5% of 200k) equals 15k. So same result.

So either way, it's 15k. So the answer should be C. But wait, let me look at the options again. Option C is 15,000. So that's the correct answer.

But wait, wait a minute. I thought the additional is 1.5% on top, so perhaps I should calculate it differently. Let me think again. The problem states: he receives 1% on all his sales, and an additional 1.5% on all sales above 1 million.

So the total commission is (1% of total sales) + (1.5% of (sales -1m if >1m)). So for 1.2m, it's 1% of 1.2m = 12,000, plus 1.5% of 0.2m = 3,000. So total 15k. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer is C: $15,000.

Mr. Brown earns a 1% commission on all his sales and an additional 1.5% commission on sales exceeding $1,000,000. To calculate his total commission for selling $1,200,000 worth of goods:

1. **Base Commission**: 1% of $1,200,000 is calculated as:  
   \[
   0.01 \times 1,200,000 = 12,000
   \]

2. **Additional Commission**: For the amount exceeding $1,000,000 (i.e., $200,000), an additional 1.5% is applied:  
   \[
   0.015 \times 200,000 = 3,000
   \]

3. **Total Commission**: The sum of the base commission and the additional commission is:  
   \[
   12,000 + 3,000 = 15,000
   \]

Thus, Mr. Brown earns **$15,000** in total commission.

**Answer: C**
