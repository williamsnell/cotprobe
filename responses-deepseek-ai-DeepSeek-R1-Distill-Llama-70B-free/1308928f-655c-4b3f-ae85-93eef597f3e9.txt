Question:

A landlord was the owner of a two-story dwelling house and leased it completely furnished to a tenant for a 10-year period. Toward the end of the seventh year of the term, a violent storm blew off several of the roof shingles. The tenant noticed a leak through the roof where the shingles had blown off, but didn't make any repairs. A month later, a severe rain storm occurred and water leaked through the roof, causing damage to the valuable parquet floors in the two rooms below. In a subsequent proceeding by the landlord against the tenant to recover for the damage to the parquet floors resulting from the leak, liability would most likely be imposed upon

Options:

A: the landlord, because he failed to inspect the property after the storm
B: both the landlord and the tenant, because they both neglected their responsibilities in maintaining the property.
C: the tenant, because a tenant for years is obligated to make such ordinary repairs on the leased property.
D: the landlord, because he was under an implied obligation to keep the premises in a habitable condition.
E: the landlord, because he was under an affirmative obligation to deliver the premises in a reasonable state of repair.
F: the tenant, because he noticed the damage and failed to report it to the landlord
G: the tenant, because he is responsible for any damage that occurs during his lease period
H: the landlord, because of the contractual obligation under the lease to make all necessary repairs during the term of the lease.
I: the tenant, because he was negligent in maintaining the property
J: the landlord, because he didn't provide sufficient maintenance during the lease period

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this landlord-tenant law question. Let's see what the question says.

The landlord owns a two-story house, fully furnished, and leased it to a tenant for 10 years. So it's a long-term lease, which is important because the length might affect the responsibilities.

Towards the end of the seventh year, a violent storm blows off some roof shingles. The tenant notices a leak where the shingles are missing but doesn't repair it. Then a month later, another severe rainstorm happens, causing water to leak through the roof and damage the parquet floors in two rooms below. The landlord is suing the tenant for the damage.

So the question is about who is liable for the damage to the floors.

I remember that in landlord-tenant law, there are certain responsibilities. Generally, the tenant is responsible for keeping the property in good condition, but there are limits. For a lease, the tenant is usually responsible for minor repairs, but major repairs are the landlord's responsibility. But wait, I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, in some cases, the landlord is required to maintain the premises in a habitable condition, especially under the implied warranty of habitability. But that usually applies to conditions that affect the tenant's health and safety, like heating or structural issues. But this is a furnished house, so maybe that plays a role.

Wait, the lease is for a furnished house. That might mean that the landlord is providing more than just the structure—maybe including fixtures and even the furniture. So perhaps the landlord has a greater responsibility here.

But the key point is the repairs. The roof is part of the structure. Generally, the landlord is responsible for structural repairs unless the lease says otherwise. The tenant is usually responsible for minor repairs and maintaining the property, but major issues like the roof are the landlord's duty.

In this case, the storm blew off shingles, which is a structural issue. The tenant noticed the leak but didn't repair it. If the tenant was supposed to make ordinary repairs, then maybe they were negligent. But wait, the roof isn't an ordinary repair—it's a more significant issue.

So, the tenant might have a duty to report the problem to the landlord, but if the tenant is under an obligation to make ordinary repairs, then failing to fix a minor issue (like replacing shingles) could make them liable for further damage.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, the tenant is responsible for repairs that are considered "ordinary" or minor. For example, if a pipe bursts because of something the tenant did, but if it's due to normal wear and tear, the landlord is responsible.

In this scenario, the roof is damaged by a storm, which is an act of nature, not the tenant's fault. So the initial damage isn't the tenant's responsibility. However, the tenant noticed the leak and didn't repair it. If the tenant is under a duty to make ordinary repairs, then failing to fix the roof (like replacing shingles) would be a breach.

But wait, replacing roof shingles after a storm—does that count as an ordinary repair? I'm not sure. It depends on the extent of the damage. If it's a small number of shingles, maybe it's ordinary. But if it's a large area, that might be a major repair, which is the landlord's responsibility.

The question says "several" shingles were blown off. So maybe it's a minor issue. In that case, the tenant's failure to repair could lead to liability because the subsequent rain caused more damage.

So the tenant had a duty to make ordinary repairs. By not doing so, the damage worsened, leading to the parquet floors being damaged.

Alternatively, if the landlord is responsible for structural repairs, then the tenant's inaction wouldn't matter. But I'm trying to remember the rules.

I think in most jurisdictions, the tenant is responsible for repairs that are considered ordinary, and the landlord for major or structural repairs. So if the roof's structural integrity is the landlord's responsibility, but minor repairs (like replacing a few shingles) are the tenant's, then the tenant's failure to act would lead to liability.

Wait, but if the roof is a structural component, then maybe it's the landlord's responsibility regardless. But the initial damage was caused by a storm, an act of God. The landlord would be responsible for maintaining the structure, so if the roof was in disrepair, the landlord should have fixed it. But the storm just happened, so maybe the landlord wasn't negligent. Unless the roof was already in bad condition due to the landlord's failure to maintain it.

But the question doesn't mention anything about the roof's condition before the storm. So maybe the storm caused the damage, and the tenant didn't fix it.

So, the tenant noticed the leak and didn't make repairs. If the tenant is obligated to make ordinary repairs, then their failure could make them liable for the resulting damage.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the tenant is liable because a tenant is obligated to make ordinary repairs. That seems to fit.

Option F says the tenant is liable for failing to report it. But I think the duty is to repair, not necessarily to report, unless the lease requires that.

Option I says the tenant was negligent in maintaining the property. That could be another angle, but negligence per se because of the repair duty.

So I'm leaning toward option C.

Wait, but some states have the landlord responsible for maintaining the premises, especially if it's a furnished dwelling. So perhaps the landlord has a higher duty here. But I'm not sure if that applies.

Wait, the implied warranty of habitability requires the landlord to maintain the premises so that they're fit for living. Leaks could make the place uninhabitable, but the tenant is a long-term lessee. So maybe the landlord is responsible for structural repairs.

But in that case, the initial damage was from a storm, not the landlord's negligence. So perhaps the landlord isn't at fault unless they failed to maintain the roof, leading to it being vulnerable to storms.

But the question doesn't say the roof was in bad shape before the storm. It just happened during the lease. So maybe the landlord isn't liable for the storm damage unless it's due to their negligence.

Alternatively, if the roof is part of the structure, the landlord is responsible for repairs. So the tenant's failure to fix the roof (if it's the landlord's responsibility) wouldn't make the tenant liable.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline:

1. Landlord's responsibilities: Structural repairs, major components like roof, walls, foundation. Unless the lease says otherwise.

2. Tenant's responsibilities: Minor repairs, keeping the property in good condition, not committing waste.

In this case, the roof damage is from a storm, which is an act of God. So the initial damage isn't anyone's fault. But the tenant noticed the leak and didn't fix it. If the tenant is responsible for minor repairs, then failing to replace the shingles would be a breach, leading to the subsequent damage.

So the tenant's failure to make ordinary repairs caused the further damage. Therefore, the tenant is liable.

So looking back at the options, option C says the tenant is liable because they are obligated to make ordinary repairs.

Another option is F, which is about failing to report. But I think the duty is to repair, not report. So F might not be correct.

So the answer should be C.

In this scenario, the landlord leased a fully furnished house to the tenant for a 10-year period. During the seventh year, a violent storm blew off several roof shingles, causing a leak. The tenant noticed the leak but failed to make repairs. A month later, another severe rainstorm caused further water damage, leading to damage to the parquet floors. The question is whether the landlord or the tenant is liable for the damage.

Under landlord-tenant law, the tenant is generally responsible for making ordinary or minor repairs, while the landlord is responsible for major or structural repairs. In this case, the roof is a structural component, but the question focuses on the tenant's duty to address the leak caused by the missing shingles. The tenant's failure to repair the leak, which could be considered an ordinary repair, led to the subsequent damage to the parquet floors. This failure constitutes a breach of the tenant's obligation to maintain the property in good condition.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C**: Correct. The tenant is obligated to make ordinary repairs, and their failure to do so caused the further damage.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The tenant's primary duty is to repair, not necessarily to report the issue unless required by the lease.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. While the tenant was negligent, the negligence stems from their failure to make ordinary repairs, which is already covered by Option C.

Thus, the tenant's liability arises from their obligation to make ordinary repairs, making Option C the correct answer.

Answer: C
