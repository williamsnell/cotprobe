Okay, so I have this question about Erik Erikson's theory, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step. 

Erikson's theory is about psychosocial development, right? He proposed eight stages, each with a specific crisis or conflict that a person must resolve. Each stage is associated with an age group and a particular issue. 

The question is asking about the developmental crisis for a young adult. I remember that the stages go from infancy through old age, so I need to recall which stage corresponds to young adulthood.

Let me list out the stages as I remember them:

1. Trust vs. Mistrust (infancy)
2. Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt (toddlerhood)
3. Initiative vs. Guilt (early school age)
4. Industry vs. Inferiority (late childhood)
5. Identity vs. Role Confusion (adolescence)
6. Intimacy vs. Isolation (young adulthood)
7. Generativity vs. Stagnation (middle adulthood)
8. Integrity vs. Despair (old age)

Wait, so each stage is tied to a specific age group. So the question is about young adults. Looking at the list, stage 6 is Intimacy vs. Isolation, which is for young adults. So the crisis here would be intimacy versus isolation.

Looking at the options, option G is Intimacy vs. Isolation. So that must be the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up the stages. I remember that Identity vs. Role Confusion is during adolescence, which is right before young adulthood. So yes, young adults are dealing with forming intimate relationships, which is stage six.

So the correct answer should be G.
