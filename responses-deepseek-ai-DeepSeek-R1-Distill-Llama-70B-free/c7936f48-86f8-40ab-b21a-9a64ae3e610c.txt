Question:

A woman sued her former employer in state court, asserting age and sex discrimination claims under both state and federal law. The woman's attorney had recently been embarrassed in court by the judge to whom the case was assigned. Wishing to avoid difficulties with the judge, the woman's attorney promptly removed the case to federal court on the basis of federal-question jurisdiction. The employer's attorney has timely moved to remand. How is the federal court likely to proceed?

Options:

A: Retain the case, because the employer's attorney did not provide sufficient reasons for remand.
B: Remand the entire case.
C: Retain the case to avoid the risk of bias and impropriety in having it proceed before a judge who has shown clear hostility toward the woman's attorney.
D: Retain the case, because the woman's attorney has a valid concern about possible bias in state court.
E: Retain the case, as federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over federal claims.
F: Retain the case, as the employer's attorney has not objected to the removal.
G: Retain the case, because it was timely removed and the woman alleges federal claims.
H: Remand the state claims but keep the federal claims.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about federal court jurisdiction and removal. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by breaking down the question step by step.

So, the scenario is a woman sued her former employer in state court, claiming age and sex discrimination under both state and federal law. Then, her attorney removed the case to federal court based on federal-question jurisdiction. The employer's attorney has moved to remand, and we need to decide how the federal court will proceed.

First, I remember that removal is a procedure where a defendant can move a case from state to federal court if there's a basis for federal jurisdiction. The most common reasons are diversity jurisdiction or federal question jurisdiction. Here, the attorney used federal-question jurisdiction because the woman is asserting federal claims.

Wait, but the reason the attorney removed it was because the judge embarrassed him. That seems like a tactical move, not necessarily based on jurisdictional grounds. But the question is about the legal basis, not the attorney's motivations.

So, under federal law, when a case is removed, the federal court has to determine whether it has jurisdiction. If it does, it can keep the case; if not, it remands it back to state court.

The plaintiff has both state and federal claims. So, in federal court, there's something called supplemental jurisdiction. Under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367, federal courts can hear state claims that are so related to the federal claims that they form part of the same case or controversy. But wait, the initial removal is based on federal-question jurisdiction, which requires that the case arises under federal law.

So, the federal court would have jurisdiction over the federal claims. What about the state claims? They can be kept under supplemental jurisdiction unless there's a reason to decline, like if the federal claims are dismissed or if the state claims outweigh the federal ones.

But wait, the employer moved to remand. So, perhaps they're arguing that removal wasn't proper. Why might that be the case? Well, maybe because not all claims are covered by federal jurisdiction. Or perhaps the case doesn't meet the requirements for removal.

Wait, another point: the federal court can only hear cases where there's complete diversity if it's a diversity case, but this is a federal question. So, as long as the federal claims are substantial, the court can take jurisdiction.

But wait, the question says the case was originally in state court. The defendant (employer) can remove it if the case is within the original jurisdiction of the federal court. So, the presence of a federal question gives the federal court jurisdiction, so removal is proper.

So, the federal court would retain the case, right? Unless there's a reason to remand, like if the federal claims are not substantial or if there's some procedural defect.

Wait, but the options include remanding the entire case or keeping some claims. Let me look at the options.

Option B says remand the entire case. Why would that happen? Maybe if the federal court determines it doesn't have jurisdiction. But the woman has federal claims, so the federal court does have jurisdiction over those. So remanding the entire case would mean the federal court doesn't have jurisdiction, which doesn't seem right.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that the state court also has jurisdiction over the federal claims. Under the principles of federalism, state courts can hear federal cases unless Congress has given exclusive jurisdiction to federal courts. For example, bankruptcy and patent cases are exclusive, but most federal questions can be heard in state courts.

So, if the state court could have heard the case, the federal court might remand it under the "abstention doctrine" or for some other reason, but that's discretionary, not mandatory.

Wait, but the removal was based on federal-question jurisdiction, so the federal court has original jurisdiction. So, the case was properly removed. Therefore, the federal court would retain the case unless there's a compelling reason to remand.

Looking at the options, option B is to remand the entire case. Why would that happen? Perhaps if the federal court doesn't have jurisdiction, but I think they do because there's a federal question.

Alternatively, maybe the state claims can't be kept. But under supplemental jurisdiction, the court can keep them unless it's necessary to decline. So, the court would likely keep both the federal and state claims.

But wait, another point: the attorney removed the case because he was embarrassed by the judge. That doesn't affect jurisdiction, but perhaps the court might consider the reason for removal. However, jurisdiction is determined objectively, not based on the motivations of the parties.

So, the federal court would look at whether there's a basis for jurisdiction. Since there are federal claims, removal was proper. Therefore, the court would retain the case.

Wait, but let me think again. The employer's attorney moved to remand. Why? Maybe because the case isn't removable. For example, if the federal claims aren't sufficient or if the removal was procedurally defective.

Wait, the case was removed promptly, so procedural requirements are met. The federal claims are there, so the court can keep it.

So, the options are:

A: Retain because employer didn't provide reasons. But the federal court doesn't need reasons from the employer; the court decides based on jurisdiction.

B: Remand entire case. Only if no jurisdiction, but there is jurisdiction.

C: Retain to avoid bias. That's a possibility. But bias is usually addressed through recusal, not by removing the case. The federal court's decision to retain is based on jurisdiction, not on avoiding bias in state court.

D: Retain because attorney has valid concern about bias. Same as C, but again, the court's jurisdiction isn't based on that. The concern is the attorney's, but the court's decision is about jurisdiction.

E: Retain because exclusive jurisdiction. But federal courts don't have exclusive jurisdiction over discrimination claims. Those can be heard in state court.

F: Retain because employer didn't object? No, the employer did object by moving to remand.

G: Retain because timely removed and federal claims. That makes sense. If it's timely and there's a federal claim, the court has jurisdiction.

H: Remand state, keep federal. But under supplemental jurisdiction, the court can keep both. Why remand part? Unless the state claims are too separate, but here they are part of the same case.

Wait, but if the federal court decides to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, it can hear the state claims. So the court wouldn't remand any part unless it decides to decline supplemental jurisdiction, which is discretionary. But the question is about how the court is likely to proceed, not what it could do.

In most cases, the federal court would retain both claims under supplemental jurisdiction.

So, looking back at the options, option B is remand the entire case. I thought the court would retain it, so maybe the correct answer isn't B.

Wait, another angle: There's a concept called "well-pleaded complaint rule." For federal question jurisdiction, the plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint must raise a federal issue. If the plaintiff's claims are based on state law but also present a federal issue, then jurisdiction exists. Here, she's asserting both state and federal discrimination claims. So, the presence of the federal claims provides a basis for removal.

So, the federal court has jurisdiction and will retain the case. So, the options that say retain are A, C, D, E, F, G.

Looking at the options, option G says "Retain the case, because it was timely removed and the woman alleges federal claims." That seems correct because the presence of federal claims gives jurisdiction.

But wait, could there be any reason to remand? Like, if the state claims are the only ones left after federal are dismissed, but that's not the case here.

Another point: The employer could argue that removal is improper because the case was originally in state court and the federal court shouldn't exercise jurisdiction. But under the law, if there's a federal question, removal is proper.

So, the federal court will likely retain the case. So, the correct answer would be option B? No, option B says remand the entire case, which I don't think is correct because the federal court has jurisdiction.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the options. Let me recheck.

Option B is "Remand the entire case." I thought that's not correct because there's a federal claim. So the correct answer should be one that retains the case.

Looking again, the options:

A: Retain because employer didn't provide sufficient reasons. But the employer did move to remand, so they provided reasons. The court decides based on jurisdiction, not on the employer's reasons.

B: Remand entire case. Only if no jurisdiction, but there is jurisdiction.

C: Retain to avoid bias. Not a jurisdictional reason, more of a discretionary reason, but courts usually don't retain cases just because of possible bias in state court.

D: Retain because attorney's concern about bias. Similar to C, not a jurisdictional basis.

E: Retain because exclusive jurisdiction. But discrimination claims aren't exclusively federal.

F: Retain because employer didn't object. No, employer did object by moving to remand.

G: Retain because timely and federal claims. Yes, because the case was properly removed based on federal-question.

So, the answer should be G.

Wait, but another thought: 28 U.S.C. ยง 1441 allows removal of any case that is within the original jurisdiction of the federal court. Since the woman's complaint includes federal claims, the case is removable. So the removal was proper, and the federal court should retain it.

So, the answer is G.
</think>

The question revolves around whether a federal court will retain or remand a case removed from state court based on federal-question jurisdiction. The woman sued her employer in state court, alleging both state and federal discrimination claims. Her attorney removed the case to federal court, citing federal-question jurisdiction, and the employer moved to remand. The key issue is whether the federal court has jurisdiction and how it will proceed.

Under federal law, removal is proper if the case falls within the original jurisdiction of the federal court. Here, the presence of federal claims (age and sex discrimination) provides a basis for federal-question jurisdiction. The federal court can also exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the related state claims under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367, unless it decides to decline jurisdiction, which is discretionary.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The employer did provide reasons for remand by moving to remand, so this is not a valid basis for retaining the case.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The federal court has jurisdiction over the federal claims, so remanding the entire case is not appropriate.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While avoiding bias is a concern, the federal court's decision to retain the case is based on jurisdiction, not the attorney's concerns about bias.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Similar to Option C, the attorney's concerns about bias do not affect the jurisdictional analysis.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Federal courts do not have exclusive jurisdiction over discrimination claims; state courts can also hear these cases.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The employer did object to removal by moving to remand, so this option is factually inaccurate.
- **Option G**: Correct. The case was timely removed, and the presence of federal claims establishes federal jurisdiction. The federal court is likely to retain the case based on these grounds.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The federal court can retain both the federal and state claims under supplemental jurisdiction, so there is no need to remand the state claims.

The federal court is likely to retain the case because it was timely removed and the woman alleges federal claims, which establish federal jurisdiction.
