Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about calculating the average markup on sales for two departments. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The R.L. Electronics store has two departments: radio and tube. The radio department has a markup of 30%, and their sales last month were $15,000. The tube department has a markup of 25%, with sales of $40,000. I need to find the average markup on sales for both departments combined.

Hmm, wait, what exactly is markup? I think markup is the percentage added to the cost price to get the selling price. So markup percentage is calculated based on the cost, not the selling price. But sometimes people get confused whether it's based on cost or selling price. Oh right, markup is usually based on cost. So if the markup is 30%, that means the selling price is cost plus 30% of cost, which is 130% of cost.

But wait, the question is about the average markup. How do you average percentages? I think for averaging percentages like this, especially when they're based on different sales amounts, I should calculate a weighted average. So the average markup isn't just (30 +25)/2 = 27.5%, because that would be the simple average. But since each department contributes different sales amounts, the average should weight each markup by their respective sales.

Wait, but wait another moment. Is the markup applied to cost or to selling price? Because that can change the calculation approach. Let me think. If markup is on cost, then for each department:

Markup % = (Selling Price - Cost) / Cost * 100.

But the question gives me the sales (which I assume are selling prices), and the markup percentages. So perhaps I can compute the cost for each department, then find the total markup and total cost to compute the overall average markup.

Let me try that approach.

For the Radio department:
Markup is 30%, so Selling Price (SP) = Cost (C) + 30% of C = 1.3 * C.
Given sales (SP) is $15,000. So,
15,000 = 1.3 * C_radio
=> C_radio = 15,000 / 1.3
Let me compute that. 15,000 divided by 1.3. Let's see, 1.3 * 11,538.46 is approximately 15,000. So C_radio is approximately $11,538.46.

For the Tube department:
Markup is 25%, so SP = 1.25 * C.
Sales are $40,000, so:
40,000 = 1.25 * C_tube
=> C_tube = 40,000 / 1.25 = 32,000.

Now, total cost for both departments is C_radio + C_tube = 11,538.46 +32,000 = 43,538.46.

Total Selling Price (which should be the sum of both sales) is 15,000 +40,000 =55,000.

Now, total markup is total SP minus total cost. So 55,000 - 43,538.46 = 11,461.54.

Wait, no, actually, total markup is the sum of each department's markup. Alternatively, I can calculate it as total SP minus total cost. Either way, it should be the same.

So now, the overall markup percentage would be (Total Markup) / (Total Cost) * 100.

So (11,461.54) / (43,538.46) * 100.

Let me compute that. 11,461.54 divided by 43,538.46. Let me get the approximate value.

43,538.46 * 0.26 = let's see, 43,538 *0.2=8,707.6, 43,538 *0.06=2,612.28. So 0.26 is around 11,319.88. Hmm, but the numerator is 11,461.54, which is a bit higher.

So 11,461.54 /43,538.46 = approximately 0.263. So 26.3%.

Wait, that's about 26.3%. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 11,461.54 ÷ 43,538.46.

Well, 43,538.46 * 0.26 = let me calculate:

43,538.46 * 0.2 = 8,707.692

43,538.46 * 0.06 = 2,612.3076

Adding them: 8,707.692 + 2,612.3076 = 11,319.9996, approximately 11,320.

So 11,461.54 is 141.54 more than 11,320. So 141.54 /43,538.46 ≈ 0.00325.

So total is approximately 0.26 + 0.00325 = 0.26325 or 26.325%. So roughly 26.33%.

Looking at the options, option A is 26.36%, which is close to my calculation. Let me double-check my steps for any errors.

Wait, another way to compute the average markup is to compute the weighted average based on the cost. Because the markup is a percentage of cost, the average markup would be (sum of (markup * cost)) / total cost.

Wait, the weights here would be the cost of each department. Because for each department, the markup is calculated on its own cost. So perhaps the correct way is to calculate the total markup divided by the total cost.

Which is exactly what I did earlier. So yes, that's the approach.

So the average markup is approximately 26.33%, which matches option A: 26.36%.

Therefore, the correct answer should be A.

To calculate the average markup on sales for the two departments, we need to compute the weighted average markup based on their respective sales amounts. The markup percentages are applied to the cost price, so we first determine the cost for each department using the given sales and markup percentages.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for each department
1. **Radio Department**:  
   Markup = 30%, Sales = $15,000.  
   Selling Price (SP) = 1.3 × Cost.  
   \[
   \text{Cost}_{\text{radio}} = \frac{\$15,000}{1.3} \approx \$11,538.46
   \]

2. **Tube Department**:  
   Markup = 25%, Sales = $40,000.  
   Selling Price (SP) = 1.25 × Cost.  
   \[
   \text{Cost}_{\text{tube}} = \frac{\$40,000}{1.25} = \$32,000
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate total cost and total markup
- **Total Cost**:  
  \[
  \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost}_{\text{radio}} + \text{Cost}_{\text{tube}} = \$11,538.46 + \$32,000 = \$43,538.46
  \]

- **Total Sales (Selling Price)**:  
  \[
  \text{Total Sales} = \$15,000 + \$40,000 = \$55,000
  \]

- **Total Markup**:  
  \[
  \text{Total Markup} = \text{Total Sales} - \text{Total Cost} = \$55,000 - \$43,538.46 = \$11,461.54
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the average markup
The average markup is calculated as:  
\[
\text{Average Markup} = \frac{\text{Total Markup}}{\text{Total Cost}} \times 100 = \frac{\$11,461.54}{\$43,538.46} \times 100 \approx 26.33\%
\]

### Final Answer
The closest option to the calculated average markup of 26.33% is **26.36%**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
