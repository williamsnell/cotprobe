Okay, so I've got this economics question here about Classical analysis and what happens during a recession. Hmm, I remember that Classical economists have some specific views on how the economy works. Let me think about what I learned before.

The question is asking what, according to Classical analysis, can help an economy in a recession get back to full employment. The options are A through J, each with different policies or economic factors.

Classical economists, if I recall correctly, believe in the idea of the self-correcting economy. They think that the economy naturally tends towards full employment because wages and prices are flexible. So, during a recession, they wouldn't advocate for government intervention. Instead, they might argue that if wages and prices can adjust downward, the economy will correct itself.

Wait, so if wages and prices fall, that would make labor more attractive to hire, right? Because lower wages mean businesses can hire more without as much cost. And lower prices might encourage people to buy more, boosting demand. So that should help the economy recover on its own without needing things like expansionary policies.

Looking at the options, I see option I is "falling wages and prices." That fits with what I was just thinking. Option A is reducing interest rates, but isn't that more of a Keynesian approach, where they use monetary policy to stimulate the economy? Classical economists might not focus as much on that since they rely on the market's natural adjustment.

Option D is expansionary monetary policy, which again sounds like something a central bank would do, maybe in Keynesian economics to increase demand. But Classical economists probably wouldn't support that because they don't think the government should interfere.

Options C, E, F, G, H are about taxes, government spending, imports, exports. Those seem more like fiscal policy tools, which Keynesians might use. So Classical analysis wouldn't go for those. They'd say the market adjusts on its own.

So the correct answer should be I: falling wages and prices. Because Classical economists believe that allowing wages and prices to adjust downward will help the economy return to full employment without intervention.

According to Classical economic theory, the economy is self-correcting and tends toward full employment naturally. During a recession, Classical economists argue that falling wages and prices will restore equilibrium by making labor more affordable and increasing demand. This approach emphasizes market adjustment without government intervention. 

The correct answer is:

I: falling wages and prices.

Answer: I
