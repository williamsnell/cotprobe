Question:

After being passed over for a promotion, an aeronautic engineer became a whistleblower. He contacted a government agency to state that the company for which he worked was submitting false safety reports on newly built aircraft. When the company learned that the engineer was leaking this information to the government agency, he was fired from his job. Afterward, the engineer sued the company for wrongful termination of employment. During the discovery stage of litigation, the engineer was deposed by the company's attorney. In his deposition, the engineer stated that the company submitted false safety reports to the government agency to cover up structural defects in its aircraft. A pilot was injured when one of the company'sairplanes he was piloting crashed. The pilot asserteda strict products liability tort against the company. At thal, the pilot seeks to introduce into evidence portions of the engineer's deposition from his wrongful termination lawsuit against the company. Assume that the engineer is unavailable to testify at trial. Upon objection by the company, the trial court judge should rule the engineer's deposition testimony

Options:

A: admissible as former testimony.
B: inadmissible as hearsay within the business records exception.
C: inadmissible due to the engineer's unavailability.
D: admissible as a statement against interest.
E: admissible as a vicarious admission.
F: inadmissible, because the company did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer on the liability issue for which the statement is now being offered.
G: admissible as a dying declaration.
H: inadmissible because the engineer's deposition is biased.
I: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
J: admissible as a statement of personal or family history.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's start by breaking down the scenario step by step.

The situation involves an aeronautic engineer who was passed over for a promotion and then became a whistleblower. He contacted a government agency about his company submitting false safety reports on new aircraft. When the company found out, they fired him. He sued for wrongful termination, and during the discovery phase, he was deposed. In his deposition, he stated that the company submitted false reports to cover up structural defects.

Now, a pilot was injured when one of the company's airplanes crashed. The pilot is suing under strict product liability and wants to use parts of the engineer's deposition testimony. The engineer is unavailable for trial, and the company objects. The question is whether the judge should admit this deposition testimony.

First, I remember that deposition testimony can be admissible under certain hearsay exceptions. But wait, depositions themselves are considered prior statements. I think Rule 804 of the Federal Rules of Evidence deals with situations where the declarant is unavailable. 

So, under Rule 804, there are exceptions like former testimony (804(b)(1)) and statements against interest (804(b)(3)), among others. But I need to see which applies here.

The engineer's deposition was taken in a different case, the wrongful termination suit. The pilot is now using it in a product liability case. The key is whether the deposition can be used in this new case.

I recall that for former testimony to be admissible under 804(b)(1), the testimony must have been given in a proceeding where the declarant was subject to cross-examination, and the opposing party in the current case must have had a chance to develop the testimony by cross or direct. Also, the testimony must be relevant and not be offered to contradict the declarant's prior inconsistent statement.

Wait, but in the wrongful termination case, the company (same as the current defendant) was the one taking the deposition. So when the engineer testified, the company's attorney was conducting the deposition. Now, the pilot wants to use that testimony against the company in a different case.

The issue is whether the company had the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer in the prior deposition on the specific issue now being raised. Because the prior case was about wrongful termination, and this case is about product liability due to structural defects, maybe the cross-examination in the deposition didn't cover the same issues as the current case.

So, under Rule 804(b)(1), the party against whom the testimony is being offered (the company) must have had an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant on the same issue. If the prior testimony was about the company's reasons for firing the engineer, perhaps the cross didn't delve into the specifics of the aircraft's structural defects as it relates to product liability.

If that's the case, then the testimony might not qualify under the former testimony exception because the cross-examination wasn't on the same issues. So maybe option F is relevant here, which says inadmissible because the company didn't have the opportunity to cross on the liability issue now.

Alternatively, could the statement be a statement against interest? Well, the engineer's statement that the company submitted false reports and had structural defects would be against the company's interest, but under Rule 804(b)(3), the statement must be against the declarant's own interest. Wait, the engineer's statement was against the company, not himself. So maybe that exception doesn't apply here.

Another angle: the business records exception. But the deposition isn't a business record; it's a prior testimony. So option B might not be correct.

Option E suggests vicarious admission. I think that's under 801(d)(2)(D), where a statement is offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and during its existence. So the engineer was an employee, and his statement was about matters within his duties. So could this be an admission? But wait, the statement was made during a deposition in a different case. Are statements in a deposition considered as admissions by a party opponent?

Wait, FRE 801(d)(2) says that a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within their scope and during the employment relationship. So the engineer's statement in the deposition would be an admission by the company. But wait, the statement was made during the deposition, which was part of the wrongful termination suit. So, the statement was made by the employee (engineer) about a matter within the scope of his employment, so it qualifies as an admission.

But wait, in the wrongful termination case, the company was the defendant, and the engineer was the plaintiff. So when the company's attorney deposed the engineer, his statements would be admissions by the company. Because the engineer was the plaintiff, not the company's employee in that context. Wait, no. The engineer was a former employee. So in the wrongful termination case, the engineer is the plaintiff, and the company is the defendant. The engineer's statements in his own case against the company would be his own statements, not the company's. So his statements can't be admissions by the company because he's not the company's agent in that context.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. In the wrongful termination case, the engineer is the plaintiff, suing the company (defendant). So when he testifies in his own case, any statements he makes are his own, not the company's. So his deposition testimony would be his own statements, which would be hearsay unless an exception applies.

So, the company's attorney took the deposition. The engineer's statements are his own, so they can't be admissions of the company. Therefore, option E (vicarious admission) doesn't apply because the statement wasn't made by the company's agent in the current case context.

Back to the options. So the engineer's deposition is being offered by the pilot against the company. The company objects. The engineer is unavailable.

So the first possibility is whether the deposition qualifies as former testimony under 804(b)(1). For that, the testimony must have been given in a proceeding where the party against whom it's now being offered had an opportunity to cross-examine. But the prior proceeding was the engineer's own case against the company. The current case is a different one, but the company was the defendant in both. So the company had the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer in the prior case.

Wait, but the subject matter is different. In the prior case, the engineer was testifying about his termination, whereas in the current case, it's about product liability. So even if the company cross-examined him before, it was on different issues. So perhaps they didn't get the chance to cross on the specific points now being raised.

In that case, the testimony wouldn't qualify under the former testimony exception because the cross-examination wasn't on the same issue. So option F says inadmissible because no opportunity to cross on the liability issue now being offered. That seems to fit.

Alternatively, could it fall under another exception? Maybe not. If it's not former testimony, then it's hearsay and needs an exception. But the other exceptions like statement against interest don't apply because the engineer's statement was against the company, not himself. So it's not a statement against his own interest.

Therefore, the deposition is hearsay, and without a valid exception, it's inadmissible. So the options would be either F or I. Option I says inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. But I thought F was a reason, which points to the specific problem of opportunity to cross on the same issue. 

Wait, but 804(b)(1) requires that the party against whom it's offered had an opportunity to cross-examine on the same subject matter. If they didn't, then the former testimony exception doesn't apply. So the testimony is hearsay, and if no exception applies, it's inadmissible. So option F says it's inadmissible because the company didn't have the chance to cross on the liability issue now. That's a specific application of 804(b)(1)'s requirements.

Alternatively, some might argue that since the company had the opportunity to cross in the prior case, even if on a different issue, it's sufficient. But I think the rule requires that the opportunity must be on the same subject matter. So the court might exclude it under F.

So looking at the options, F seems correct because the company didn't have the chance to cross on the specific liability issue now in question.

The scenario involves an aeronautic engineer who was fired after becoming a whistleblower and later sued for wrongful termination. During his deposition in that case, he testified that the company submitted false safety reports to cover up structural defects. A pilot injured in a crash caused by one of the company's airplanes seeks to admit portions of the engineer's deposition testimony in a strict product liability case, despite the engineer being unavailable for trial. The company objects, and the court must decide whether the testimony is admissible.

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1), former testimony is admissible if the declarant is unavailable, the testimony was given in a prior proceeding, and the party against whom it is now offered had an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant on the same subject matter. Here, the engineer's deposition was taken in the wrongful termination case, where the company had the opportunity to cross-examine him. However, the subject matter in the prior case was the engineer's termination, not the structural defects or product liability issues now at play. Since the cross-examination in the prior case did not address the specific liability issues relevant to the current case, the testimony does not qualify under the former testimony exception.

Additionally, the engineer's statements do not fall under other hearsay exceptions, such as statements against interest (Rule 804(b)(3)), because the statements were against the company's interest, not the engineer's own interest. The testimony also cannot be admitted as a vicarious admission (Rule 801(d)(2)(D)) because the engineer was the plaintiff in the prior case, and his statements were not made as an agent of the company in the context of the current litigation.

Given these considerations, the engineer's deposition testimony is inadmissible because the company did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer on the specific liability issues now being raised. This aligns with option F.
