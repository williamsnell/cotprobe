Okay, so I have this physics problem here about heat transfer from a heater to a body. Hmm, I need to find the heat absorbed by the body. Let me read the question again carefully.

The electric heater releases energy at a rate of 1850 W/m². Wait, no, wait. The problem says 1850 W/m. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, maybe it's 1850 W per meter squared? Because usually, power is per area when talking about heaters. Hmm, the question says "releasing energy at the rate of 1850 W/m." Oh wait, maybe it's 1850 W per meter, but that's unusual. Wait, maybe it's a typo and should be W/m²? Because in the options, the answers are in W/m². So probably it's 1850 W/m². Or wait, perhaps the heater's power is 1850 W, and the area is per meter squared. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me parse the question again. It says the electric heater is releasing energy at the rate of 1850 W/m. Oh, that can't be right because W/m would be power per unit length, which doesn't make much sense in this context. Maybe it's 1850 W/m²? Because the options are all in W/m². So perhaps it's a typo, and the correct value is 1850 W/m².

Assuming that, the absorbing body accepts 95% of the radiation above 2.7 µm and 30% below. So the heater emits radiation, some of which is in wavelengths above 2.7 µm, some below. The body absorbs 95% of the former and 30% of the latter.

The diameter of the heating element is 25 mm, so radius is 12.5 mm or 0.0125 m. The distance between the two bodies is 10 cm, which is 0.1 m. Hmm, so maybe we need to calculate the area of the heater and the area of the body? Or perhaps the flux received by the body.

Wait, the heater's power is given as 1850 W/m. Wait, maybe it's per meter of length? So if the heater is, say, a linear source, like a heating element in a rod, and the power is 1850 W per meter of its length. So for each meter of the heater, it emits 1850 W. But then the area receiving that would depend on the geometry.

Wait, maybe the heater is circular. The diameter is 25 mm, so radius 0.0125 m. So the area of the heater is πr² = π*(0.0125)^2 ≈ 4.9087e-4 m². But if the heater emits 1850 W/m, that's 1850 W per meter of length. Wait, but how does that translate to power per area? Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the total power emitted by the heater is 1850 W, and the area is per square meter. Wait no, the question says 1850 W/m, so maybe it's a linear power. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the heater emits power uniformly in all directions. So the total power emitted is 1850 W. Then, at a distance of 10 cm, what's the flux (power per area) that the body receives? Because the flux would be the power divided by the area over which it's spread. But wait, the distance is 10 cm, but the heater's size is 25 mm diameter. So maybe the area is calculated based on the distance and the size of the heater.

Wait, in radiative transfer, the flux received by a surface from a source is calculated using the formula for radiation exchange, which can be approximated as the Stefan-Boltzmann law if we know emissivity, but this seems more like a geometric calculation.

Wait, perhaps the flux (S) at a distance d from a source of area A and power P is S = P / (A + A'), but no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the flux from a point source is S = P_total / (4πd²), but that's when the source is a point. But if the source is extended, like a disk, then the flux would be calculated differently.

Wait, the formula for flux from an extended source (like a disk) at a distance d is S = (Power per unit area of the source) * (Area of the source) / (π d²). Wait, maybe. Alternatively, the solid angle comes into play. Let me think.

The solid angle Ω subtended by a disk of radius r at a distance d is Ω = 2π(1 - cosθ), where θ is the half-angle. For a disk, θ can be found from tanθ = r/d. So tanθ = (0.0125 m) / (0.1 m) = 0.125. So θ ≈ 7.125 degrees. Then cosθ ≈ 0.9925 (since cos(7 degrees) is around 0.9925). So Ω ≈ 2π(1 - 0.9925) )= 2π*(0.0075) ≈ 0.0471 sr.

Wait, but the total power emitted by the heater is 1850 W/m. Wait, so if it's per meter, then for a length L, the power would be 1850 * L W. But I don't know L here. Hmm, this isn't making sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial power.

Alternatively, perhaps the heater's power output is 1850 W/m² as emissive power. Then, the body is at 10 cm away. So the flux at the body would depend on the distance.

Wait, let me approach this step by step.

1. The heater emits radiation. The body absorbs some of it. The absorption depends on the wavelength: 95% above 2.7 µm and 30% below.

So first, I need to find out what fraction of the heater's radiation is above and below 2.7 µm. But wait, I don't have the emissivity or the temperature of the heater. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the heater emits according to a blackbody spectrum, and 2.7 µm is the cutoff. At what temperature would a blackbody have peak emission around 2.7 µm?

Wait, Wien's displacement law: λ_max * T = 2.898e-3 m·K. So if λ_max is 2.7e-6 m, then T = 2.898e-3 / 2.7e-6 ≈ 1072 K.

But maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that all the radiation is split at 2.7 µm, so let's say some fraction is above and some below. But without knowing the temperature, it's hard to say. Wait, maybe the problem expects me to assume that the heater emits 50% above and 50% below 2.7 µm. But that's an assumption; the problem doesn't specify that.

Wait, the problem says the absorbing body accepts 95% of the radiation above 2.7 µm and 30% below. So the total absorbed is (0.95 * fraction_above) + (0.3 * fraction_below). But wait, without knowing what fraction of the heater's emission is above and below, I can't compute the absorbed power.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the heater is a blackbody emitter at a certain temperature, and the fraction can be determined using the blackbody radiation equations. So perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the fraction of the heater's emission that is above and below 2.7 µm.

Alternatively, perhaps the heater's emissivity is such that the fractions are known. Wait, but without the temperature, I can't compute that. So maybe the question expects me to make an assumption, but that's not stated.

Wait, perhaps the heater emits uniformly across all wavelengths, so half above and half below 2.7 µm. Then the absorbed would be 0.95*0.5 + 0.3*0.5 = 0.575 + 0.15 = 0.725 of the total radiation.

But wait, that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the heater's emission is such that the fraction above 2.7 µm is F, and below is (1-F), but without knowing F, I can't compute it.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem states the heater's power as 1850 W/m. Maybe that's the power per unit length. So for a heater of length L, the total power is 1850 * L W. But the diameter is 25 mm, which is 0.025 m, so radius 0.0125 m.

The distance between the heater and the body is 10 cm, which is 0.1 m. So the area over which the heater's radiation spreads is a sphere of radius 0.1 m. Wait, but if the heater is a long linear source, the flux at a point may be calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps the flux S at a distance d from a linear source of power P per unit length is S = (P / (2π d)) ). Because for a line source, the flux at a distance d is P/(2π d L), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me recall: For an infinite line source with power per unit length P (W/m), the flux at a distance d is S = P/(2π d). So in this case, P is 1850 W/m. So S would be 1850 / (2 * π * 0.1) ).

Calculating that: 1850 / (0.2 * π) ≈ 1850 / 0.6283 ≈ 2945 W/m².

Wait, that's option A: 2944 W/m². Hmm, close to my calculation.

But wait, I might have made a mistake here. Because the heater is not an infinite line; it's a finite cylinder with diameter 25 mm. So perhaps the flux isn't calculated that way. Alternatively, if the heater is considered as a point source, then the flux would be P/(4π d²). But the heater has a certain size, so maybe the flux is higher than that, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think: if the heater is a small disk, then the flux at a distance d would be S = (P / (π r²)) * (r² / (d²)) ), but that's only if the area is small compared to the distance. Wait, no, that's more for point sources.

Alternatively, the flux from a disk of radius r at a distance d is S = (P / (π r²)) ) * (1/(1 + (d/r)^2 ))^2. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Maybe it's better to use the formula for flux from a uniform disk.

Wait, I found a formula that the irradiance from a uniform disk source is E = (P_total * (1 - cosθ)) / (2π d²), where θ is the angle subtended by the disk at the point. So θ is the angle whose tan is (r/d), where r is the radius of the disk.

In this case, the radius r is 0.0125 m, d is 0.1 m. So tanθ = 0.0125 / 0.1 = 0.125. So θ is arctan(0.125) ≈ 7.125 degrees. So 1 - cosθ ≈ 1 - 0.99255 ≈ 0.00745.

Then E = (1850 * 0.00745) / (2 * π * (0.1)^2 )

Wait, wait, but 1850 is in W/m. So the total power emitted per meter is 1850 W/m. So for a length L, the power is 1850 * L W. But I don't know L, the length of the heater. Hmm, maybe in this problem, the heater's power is given as 1850 W/m, but we're considering it as a disk, which doesn't have a length. So perhaps the approach I took earlier is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the heater as a point source, so the flux at a distance d is S = P / (4π d²). But then the power P would be the total power emitted. If the heater's power is 1850 W, then S = 1850 / (4π (0.1)^2 ) ≈ 1850 / (0.04π) ≈ 1850 / 0.12566 ≈ 14725 W/m². But that's not one of the options. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe the heater's power is 1850 W, and the area is the area of a sphere with radius 0.1 m. So the surface area is 4π (0.1)^2 = 0.04π m² ≈ 0.12566 m². So the flux would be 1850 / 0.12566 ≈ 14725 W/m², which isn't an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think differently. The problem may not require considering the geometry but instead focuses on the absorption efficiency.

Wait, the problem says the absorbing body accepts 95% of the radiation above 2.7 µm and 30% of that below. So the total absorbed is 0.95 * fraction_above + 0.3 * fraction_below.

But without knowing the fraction of the heater's emission above and below 2.7 µm, I can't compute this. So perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the heater emits equally in both regions. Or maybe the fraction is determined by the blackbody spectrum.

Wait, maybe the heater is a blackbody at room temperature, but that's unlikely as it's an electric heater. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, and the fraction is given as, say, half above and half below. But that's an assumption.

Wait, without more data, perhaps the problem is simply asking to compute the absorbed power as a percentage of the heater's emission, regardless of the area. So the heater emits 1850 W/m², and the body absorbs 95% of some part and 30% of another part. But again, without knowing the split, I can't calculate it.

Wait, maybe the question is implying that the absorbing body is in an environment where the heater's radiation is the only source, and the body's area is being considered. But I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a simple multiplication: 1850 W/m² multiplied by the average absorption efficiency.

Wait, perhaps the body's absorption is an average of 95% and 30% based on the wavelength distribution. But without knowing the distribution, I can't average. Alternatively, perhaps 2.7 µm is the peak wavelength, so the area under the curve above and below that point is known.

Wait, considering a blackbody spectrum, the total power is split between wavelengths shorter and longer than 2.7 µm. So perhaps using the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the fraction of power emitted above and below λ=2.7 µm.

But this requires integrating the blackbody radiation formula over the wavelengths. Let me think about how to approach that.

The total power radiated by a blackbody is P = σ ε A T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, ε is emissivity (assuming it's 1 for a blackbody), A is area, and T is temperature.

But I don't know T. Alternatively, the fraction of power emitted above a certain wavelength can be found using the formula:

F(λ > λ0) = (1/σ T^4) ∫_{λ0}^∞ Bλ(T) dλ

But without knowing T, I can't compute this. Hmm. Maybe I can use Wien's law. Let me try to find at what temperature does the peak emission occur at 2.7 µm, as before.

Using Wien's displacement law: λ_max T = 2.898e-3 m·K. So T = 2.898e-3 / (2.7e-6) ≈ 1072 K.

So the heater is at approximately 1072 K. Now, I can compute the fraction of the emitted power that is above 2.7 µm.

The blackbody radiation formula is:

Bλ(T) = (2 h c^2) / λ^5 / (e^{h c/(λ k T)} - 1)

But integrating this from λ=2.7 µm to infinity would give the fraction of power above that wavelength.

Alternatively, there's an approximation or a table that gives the fraction of power emitted beyond a certain wavelength for a blackbody at a given temperature.

Wait, the fraction of power emitted above λ0 can be found using the formula:

F = 1 - ( (λ0 T)/c )^5 * e^{ - h c/(k λ0 T) } * (1 - e^{-h c/(k λ0 T)} )^{-1} )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fraction can be calculated using Planck's law integrated from λ=λ0 to ∞.

But this requires either a table lookup or an approximation. Alternatively, I can use the Rien function or other approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for λ >= 2.7 µm at T = 1072 K, the fraction can be approximated.

But this is getting complicated, and perhaps beyond the scope of a multiple-choice question. So maybe the problem expects me to assume that the fraction above 2.7 µm is, say, 50%, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that all of the heater's emission is above 2.7 µm, making the absorption 95% of 1850, which would be 17575 W/m², but that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 2944 W/m², which is close to 1850 * (some factor). Alternatively, perhaps the distance and geometry are involved in determining the flux.

Wait, earlier when I considered the heater as a line source with power 1850 W/m, the flux at 10 cm would be S = 1850 / (2π d) ) = 1850 / (2 * π * 0.1) ) ≈ 1850 / 0.6283 ≈ 2944 W/m².

But then the body absorbs 95% of the radiation above 2.7 µm and 30% below. If I assume that half the radiation is above and half below, then the absorbed power would be (0.95 + 0
