Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see... The question is about a laboratory test involving Fehling's solution and urine from a diabetic patient which contains sugar. When heated, a red copper compound precipitates. I need to figure out which compound that is from the given options.

First, I remember that Fehling's solution is used to test for the presence of reducing sugars. Reducing sugars, like glucose, have the ability to act as reducing agents, meaning they can donate electrons in a chemical reaction. Fehling's solution is an alkaline copper sulfate solution. Its composition is important here. 

So Fehling's solution is typically a mixture of copper sulfate and sodium tartrate (also known as Rochelle salt) in a strong alkaline medium, usually sodium hydroxide. When you heat this solution with a reducing sugar, like glucose, a reaction occurs.

I think the reaction involves the sugar reducing the copper ions. Copper in Fehling's is in the +2 oxidation state. The reducing sugar, which has aldehyde groups, will reduce these Cu²+ ions. But what's the product? I remember it's a precipitate. Oh right, it's a red precipitate. 

Wait, copper can form different compounds. Copper(I) oxide is a possibility. Let me think. Copper(I) oxide is Cu2O, which is a reddish solid. Another possibility is copper hydroxide, but I think that's more of a blue color, like in the copper(II) hydroxide. Or maybe it's another copper compound.

In the Benedict's test, which I think is similar, the reducing sugar reduces Cu²+ to Cu+, and the precipitate is copper(I) oxide. But wait, I've also heard about the formation of a brick-red precipitate in some tests. Oh wait, I think Fehling's specifically forms a red precipitate of copper(I) oxide.

So looking at the options, option A is Cu2O. That's copper(I) oxide. Option C is CuO, which is copper(II) oxide, a black solid if I'm not mistaken. So the red precipitate should be Cu2O, which is option A.

Wait, but wait again. I recall that in some tests, the solution might change color before precipitation. Fehling's solution is blue because of the copper ions. When you add the reducing sugar and heat, the solution might go from blue to a brick-red as the precipitate forms. So that's Cu2O again.

So the correct answer should be option A: Cu2O.

The question involves identifying the red copper compound that precipitates when Fehling's solution is mixed with the urine of a diabetic (containing sugar) and heated. Fehling's solution is an alkaline copper sulfate solution used to test for reducing sugars. Reducing sugars, such as glucose, can reduce Cu²+ ions in the solution. Upon heating, the Cu²+ ions are reduced to Cu⁺, forming a red precipitate of copper(I) oxide (Cu₂O). 

Among the options provided:

- **A: Cu₂O** is copper(I) oxide, a reddish solid that matches the description of the precipitate formed in this reaction.  
- **C: CuO** is copper(II) oxide, which is black and does not fit the description.  
- Other options like Cu3(PO4)2, CuO, Cu2SO4, etc., do not correspond to the red precipitate formed in this specific reaction.

Thus, the correct answer is **A: Cu₂O**, as it aligns with the reaction mechanism and the observed red precipitate.

Answer: A
