Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers: 2^1001 minus 1 and 2^1012 minus 1. Hmm, I remember something about GCDs involving exponents, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to think this through.

Wait, there's a formula for the GCD of numbers like 2^a -1 and 2^b -1. I think it's related to the GCD of the exponents themselves. Oh right! The GCD of 2^a -1 and 2^b -1 is 2^gcd(a,b) -1. So the exponents here are 1001 and 1012. I need to find the GCD of these two numbers and then plug it into that formula.

So first, find gcd(1001, 1012). Let's see. I can use the Euclidean algorithm for this. The Euclidean algorithm works by subtracting the smaller number from the larger one until they're equal or until the remainder is zero. Alternatively, you can do division with remainders.

Let me start with 1012 and 1001.

1012 divided by 1001 is 1 with a remainder of 11 (since 1001 *1 =1001, 1012-1001=11). Now take 1001 and 11.

1001 divided by 11. Let me calculate 11*90=990. Then 1001-990=11, so 11*91=1001. So the remainder is zero. That means the GCD is 11.

Wait, wait a second. Is that right? Because 1001 divided by 11: 11*91 is 1001, yes. So the GCD of 1001 and 1012 is 11.

So applying that formula, the GCD of 2^1001-1 and 2^1012-1 is 2^11 -1. Let me compute 2^11. 2^10 is 1024, so 2^11 is 2048. So 2^11 -1 is 2047.

Looking at the options, option I is 2047, which must be the correct answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, another way: 2^1001 -1 and 2^1012 -1. The formula says their GCD is 2^gcd(1001,1012) -1. Since we found gcd(1001,1012)=11, so 2^11 -1=2047. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be I.

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(2^{1001} - 1\) and \(2^{1012} - 1\) can be determined using the property that the GCD of \(2^a - 1\) and \(2^b - 1\) is \(2^{\gcd(a,b)} - 1\). 

First, we find \(\gcd(1001, 1012)\) using the Euclidean algorithm:
- \(1012 \div 1001 = 1\) with a remainder of \(11\).
- \(1001 \div 11 = 91\) with a remainder of \(0\).

Thus, \(\gcd(1001, 1012) = 11\). 

Applying the formula, the GCD of \(2^{1001} - 1\) and \(2^{1012} - 1\) is \(2^{11} - 1\). Calculating \(2^{11} = 2048\), so \(2^{11} - 1 = 2047\).

From the given options, the correct answer is **I: 2047**.
