Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's asking.

The question is about a long period of economic expansion and how it affects tax revenue and spending on welfare programs, and consequently the budget. The sentence has three blanks: the first is about tax revenue collected, the second about welfare spending, and the third about the budget outcome.

I remember that during economic expansions, the economy is doing well. So, when the economy is expanding, people are working more, earning more, and businesses are making more profits. That should mean that the government collects more taxes because income tax and corporate taxes go up. So the first blank should be something like "increases".

Next, welfare programs. Welfare spending usually goes down when the economy is good because fewer people are unemployed. Unemployment benefits, for example, would decrease when more people have jobs. So the second blank would be "decreases".

Now, the budget part. If tax revenues are increasing and welfare spending is decreasing, the government is taking in more money and spending less. That should lead to a budget surplus because revenues exceed expenditures. So the third blank is "surplus".

Looking at the options:

Option A: decreases, increases, surplus → No, because tax revenue should increase.
Option B: increases, decreases, deficit → No, because surplus is expected.
Option C: decreases, increases, deficit → No.
Option D: decreases, decreases, surplus → Tax revenue doesn't decrease.
Option E: increases, increases, surplus → Welfare spending doesn't increase.
Option F: increases, decreases, surplus → Yes, this fits.
Option G: increases, increases, deficit → No, opposite.
Option H: increases, decreases, equilibrium → Equilibrium means balanced, but here it's surplus.
Option I: decreases, decreases, deficit → No.

So the correct answer should be option F: increases, decreases, surplus.

The correct answer is F: increases decreases surplus.
