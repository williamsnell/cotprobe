Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about solubility. Hmm, I remember that Ksp is involved in solubility calculations. Let me think. The compound is Mg(OH)₂, and the Ksp is given as 1.2 × 10^-11. I need to find the solubility in grams per 100ml of solution.

Wait, the reaction is Mg(OH)₂ ⇌ Mg²+ + 2OH⁻. Right, so when Mg(OH)₂ dissolves, it dissociates into one Mg²+ ion and two OH⁻ ions. 

Let me set up an ICE table. Let's say the solubility is 's' mol/L. So, initially, the concentration of Mg²+ and OH⁻ is zero. When it dissolves, Mg²+ will be 's' and OH⁻ will be '2s' because there are two OH⁻ ions for each Mg(OH)₂ unit. At equilibrium, those are the concentrations.

The expression for Ksp should be Ksp = [Mg²+][OH⁻]^2. Plugging in the values, that's Ksp = s * (2s)^2. Which simplifies to s*(4s²) = 4s³. So 4s³ = 1.2 ×10^-11. 

Wait, solving for s. So s³ equals (1.2e-11)/4. Let me calculate that. 1.2e-11 divided by 4 is 3e-12. So s is the cube root of 3e-12. The cube root of 3 is approx 1.442, and the cube root of 1e-12 is 1e-4. So s ≈ 1.442e-4 M. 

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 4s³ = 1.2e-11 → s³ = 3e-12 → s = (3e-12)^(1/3). Let me compute that. Cube root of 3 is about 1.442, and cube root of 1e-12 is 1e-4, because (1e-4)^3 is 1e-12. So s is approximately 1.442e-4 M. 

But wait, let me calculate it more accurately. Let's compute (3)^(1/3) exactly. The cube of 1.44 is about 3? Let me see: 1.44^3 = 1.44 *1.44=2.0736, then *1.44 again → approx 3. So yeah, 1.44e-4 M is correct for s.

Now, solubility s is 1.44e-4 moles per liter. But the question asks for grams per 100ml. Hmm, okay. So per liter it's grams, so per 100ml it's grams/0.1 liters, which is 10 times less than per liter.

Wait no, wait. Let's think in terms of per 100ml. So for 0.1 liters, the moles would be s * 0.1. So grams per 100ml is moles * molar mass * 0.1? Wait, no. Wait, s is in mol/L, so in 1 liter, it's s moles. In 100ml (0.1 L), it's s *0.1 moles. Multiply by molar mass to get grams.

So let's compute s as 1.44e-4 mol/L. So in 0.1 L, that's 1.44e-5 mol. Now, molar mass of Mg(OH)₂. Mg is about 24.3 g/mol. Each OH is 17 (16 O and 1 H). So Mg(OH)₂ is 24.3 + 2*(16 +1) = 24.3 + 34 = 58.3 g/mol. 

So grams per 100ml is 1.44e-5 mol *58.3 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 1.44e-5 *58.3 = approximately 8.39e-4 grams. Wait, wait, let me compute it more precisely.

Wait, 1.44e-4 is 1.44 ×10^-4. 1.44e-4 * 0.1 is 1.44e-5.

So 1.44e-5 mol *58.3 g/mol = (1.44 *58.3) ×1e-5. 1.44 *58 is about 83.52, but wait, 1.44 *58.3. Let me compute that: 58.3 *1.44. 58 *1.44 is 83.52, and 0.3 *1.44 is 0.432, so total is 83.952. So 83.952e-5 grams. Which is 8.3952e-4 grams. So approximately 8.4e-4 grams per 100ml.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see. Option E is 8.16e-4 grams/100ml. Hmm, why is my calculation giving me 8.4e-4 but the option is 8.16e-4?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cube root. Let me recalculate s.

The Ksp is 1.2e-11 =4s³ → s³= (1.2e-11)/4= 0.3e-11=3e-12.

So s= cube root of 3e-12. Let me calculate it accurately. 3e-12 is 3*(1e-12). The cube root of 1e-12 is 1e-4. The cube root of 3 is about 1.4422.

So s ≈1.4422e-4 M.

Wait, but wait another thing. I think I might have an error in the initial setup. Because when I set up the ICE table, let me double-check. The dissolution equation is Mg(OH)₂ → Mg²+ + 2 OH⁻.

So the solubility is s, so [Mg²+] is s, [OH⁻] is 2s. So Ksp is s*(2s)^2 =4s³. That's correct.

So s is cube root of (Ksp /4) = cube_root( (1.2e-11)/4 )= cube_root(3e-12). So s= (3e-12)^(1/3)= 3^(1/3) * (1e-12)^(1/3) = 1.4422e-4 M.

So in 1 liter, moles of Mg(OH)₂ is 1.4422e-4 mol. So in 0.1 L (100ml), it's 1.4422e-5 mol.

Molar mass of Mg(OH)₂: Mg is 24.305 g/mol, O is 15.999*2, H is 1.008*2.

Wait, wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Oh wait, Mg(OH)₂ has two OH groups. So each OH is (16.00 for O and 1.008 for H) → 17.008 g/mol. So two OH groups: 2*17.008=34.016.

Mg is 24.305. So total molar mass is 24.305 +34.016 =58.321 g/mol.

So the grams in 0.1 L is 1.4422e-5 mol *58.321 g/mol.

Let me compute that: 1.4422e-5 *58.321.

Calculate:

1.4422 *58.321 → Let me compute that.

1.4422 *58.321 → Let's approximate:

1.4 *58 is 81.2.

But more accurately:

58.321 *1.4422.

Let me compute 58.321 *1.4 = ?

58.321 *1=58.321, 58.321 *0.4=23.3284. So 58.321 +23.3284=81.6494.

Then 58.321 *0.0422= Let me compute that. 58.321 *0.04=2.33284, 58.321 *0.0022=0.128305. So total is 2.33284 +0.128305=2.461145.

So total is 81.6494 +2.461145=84.1105.

So 1.4422 *58.321≈84.1105. So 84.1105e-5 grams is 8.41105e-4 grams. Approximately 8.41e-4 grams per 100ml.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E:8.16e-4. Hmm, but my calculation is about 8.4e-4. That's a bit off. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the cube root more accurately. Let me compute (3e-12)^(1/3) with a better approximation.

The cube root of 3 is approximately 1.44224957. So s=1.44224957e-4 M.

Then in 0.1 L, that's 1.44224957e-5 mol.

Multiply by molar mass 58.321 g/mol: 1.44224957e-5 *58.321.

Let me compute 1.44224957e-5 *58.321.

1.44224957e-5 is 0.0000144224957. Multiply by 58.321.

0.0000144224957 *58.321 = ?

I can compute 0.0000144224957 *58.321.

Let me do it step by step.

Compute 0.00001 *58.321 = 0.00058321.

0.0000044224957 *58.321.

0.000004 is 4e-6, so 4e-6 *58.321 = 0.000233284.

0.0000004224957 *58.321 ≈ approximately 0.0000246.

Adding all parts: 0.00058321 +0.000233284=0.000816494 +0.0000246=0.000841094 grams.

So approximately 8.41e-4 grams per 100ml.

But the options don't have 8.4e-4. Option E is 8.16e-4. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the cube root. Let me calculate 4s^3=1.2e-11 → s^3=3e-12 → s= (3e-12)^(1/3).

Wait, wait. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Compute cube root of 3:

3^(1/3) is approximately 1.44224957.

So s=1.44224957e-4 M.

So in 0.1 L: 1.44224957e-4 *0.1 =1.44224957e-5 mol.

Multiply by molar mass 58.321 g/mol: 1.44224957e-5 *58.321 = ?

Let me compute this accurately.

1.44224957e-5 mol = 0.0000144224957 mol.

Multiply by 58.321 g/mol: 0.0000144224957 *58.321.

Let me compute 0.0000144225 *58.321.

Set it up as 14.4224957e-6 *58.321.

Compute 14.4224957e-6 *58.321.

14.4224957 *58.321 = ?

Let me compute 14 *58.321 = 816.494.

0.4224957 *58.321 ≈ 24.6 (since 0.4 *58.321=23.3284, 0.0224957 *58.321≈1.31; so total ≈24.6384).

So total ≈816.494 +24.6384=841.1324.

So 841.1324e-6 grams is 0.0008411324 grams, which is 8.411324e-4 grams. So approximately 8.41e-4 grams per 100ml.

Looking at the options, the closest match isn't present. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A:3.6e-4

B:1.4e-4

C:0.12

D:9e-2

E:8.16e-4

F:1.2e-11

G:5.8e-5

H:58.312

I:1.2e-6

J:2.4e-3

Hmm, E is 8.16e-4, which is close but not exactly what I have. Did I miss a step?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me re-express the Ksp.

Wait, Ksp = [Mg²+][OH⁻]^2 = s*(2s)^2 =4s^3. Correct.

So 4s^3 =1.2e-11 → s^3=3e-12 → s= (3)^(1/3) * (1e-12)^(1/3) = 1.4422e-4 M.

Wait another thing: perhaps I should have considered more precise cube_root of 3.

Wait, let me compute cube_root of 3 more accurately.

The cube of 1.442 is 1.442^3. Let me compute:

1.442 *1.442 = 2.080 *approx.

Wait, wait, 1.442 *1.442:

First, 1 *1.442 =1.442.

0.4 *1.442=0.5768.

0.04 *1.442=0.05768.

0.002 *1.442=0.002884.

Adding these: 1.442 +0.5768=2.0188 +0.05768=2.07648 +0.002884=2.079364.

So 1.442^2≈2.079364.

Now, 1.442 *2.079364:

Compute 1 *2.079364=2.079364.

0.4 *2.079364=0.8317456.

0.04 *2.079364≈0.08317456.

0.002 *2.079364≈0.004158728.

Adding up:

2.079364 +0.8317456=2.9111096.

+0.08317456=2.99428416.

+0.004158728≈2.998442888.

So 1.442^3≈2.9984, which is very close to 3. So cube_root of 3 is approximately 1.442.

So s=1.442e-4 M.

So in 100ml, the grams are s * 0.1 * molar mass.

Wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the molar mass. Let me re-calculate the molar mass of Mg(OH)₂.

Mg: atomic weight is about 24.305 g/mol.

Each OH⁻ is (O:16.00, H:1.008) → 17.008 g/mol.

Since there are 2 OH groups, 2 *17.008=34.016 g/mol.

So total molar mass is 24.305 +34.016=58.321 g/mol. So that part was correct.

Hmm, so why is the option E 8.16e-4? Because 8.16 is close to 8.4, but not exact. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the cube_root more accurately. Let's see, 3e-12 is 3*(1e-12), so the cube root is (3)^(1/3) *1e-4.

But perhaps the exact value is needed. Let me compute s precisely.

s = (3e-12)^(1/3) = (3)^(1/3) * (1e-12)^(1/3) = 1.44224957 * 1e-4 → 1.44224957e-4 M.

So per 100ml, 0.1 L, so moles = 1.44224957e-4 * 0.1 → 1.44224957e-5 moles.

Multiply by molar mass: 1.44224957e-5 *58.321 g/mol = ?

1.44224957e-5 *58.321 = ?

Let me compute this using a calculator approach.

1.44224957e-5 = 0.0000144224957.

Multiply by 58.321:

0.0000144224957 *58.321 = ?

Let me compute 0.0000144224957 *58.321 step by step.

0.0000144224957 *58 = 0.0000144224957 *50 = 0.000721124785, plus 0.0000144224957 *8 =0.000115380964.

So 0.000721124785 +0.000115380964 = 0.00083650575.

But wait, 58.321 is 58 +0.321.

So 0.0000144224957 *0.321 = approx 0.0000046306.

So total is 0.00083650575 +0.0000046306 ≈0.00084113635 grams.

Which is 8.4113635e-4 grams. So 8.41e-4 grams per 100ml.

But the options don't have this. The closest is E:8.16e-4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation of the grams. Let me check once again.

Ah! Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup of the solubility equation.

Wait, the reaction is Mg(OH)₂ → Mg²+ + 2 OH⁻.

So the solubility is s, which leads to [Mg²+] = s, [OH⁻] = 2s.

So Ksp = s*(2s)^2 =4s^3. Correct.

So s = cube_root( Ksp /4 ) = cube_root(1.2e-11 /4 ) = cube_root(3e-12).

Which is 1.4422e-4 M.
