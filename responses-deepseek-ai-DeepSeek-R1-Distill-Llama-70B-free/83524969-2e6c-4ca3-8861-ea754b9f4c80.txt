Okay, so I have this economics problem here about a monopoly, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that a single firm monopolizes the entire widget market. It can produce at constant average and marginal costs, both equal to 10. The market demand curve is given by Q = 60 - P, where Q is quantity and P is price. I need to find the profit-maximizing price for the firm, and then choose the correct option from A to J.

Alright, first, I remember that in a monopoly, the firm is the sole supplier of the product, so the demand curve facing the firm is the same as the market demand. But wait, the firm's demand is the same as the market demand in this case, right? Because there's only one firm. So the demand curve for the firm is Q = 60 - P. But I think in economics, usually, the demand is expressed as P in terms of Q, or maybe Q in terms of P. Let me see, yes, Q here is the quantity demanded at price P. So the inverse demand function would be P = 60 - Q. Because if Q is 0, P is 60, and as Q increases, P drops by 1 for each unit increase in Q.

Next, I recall that to maximize profit, a firm will set marginal cost equal to marginal revenue. Since this is a monopoly, the marginal revenue is not the same as the price. Monopolies face a downward-sloping demand curve, so the marginal revenue is less than the price. So I'll need to find the marginal revenue curve and set it equal to MC, which is 10.

So first, let's find the total revenue (TR). TR is price multiplied by quantity. Since P = 60 - Q, TR = P * Q = (60 - Q) * Q = 60Q - Q².

Then, marginal revenue (MR) is the derivative of TR with respect to Q. So, taking the derivative of TR:

TR = 60Q - Q²
d(TR)/dQ = 60 - 2Q.

So MR = 60 - 2Q.

Now, the firm's marginal cost (MC) is constant at 10. Profit is maximized where MR = MC, so:

60 - 2Q = 10.

Let me solve for Q.

60 - 10 = 2Q → 50 = 2Q → Q = 25.

So the quantity that maximizes profit is 25 units.

Now, to find the price, I can plug this Q back into the inverse demand function:

P = 60 - Q = 60 - 25 = 35.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 35. So is that the answer?

Wait, wait, let me double-check my steps because I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, the demand curve is Q = 60 - P. That means P = 60 - Q, which is correct.

TR is P*Q = (60 - Q) * Q = 60Q - Q², correct.

Then MR is the derivative, which is 60 - 2Q, right. Then set MR = MC = 10.

So 60 - 2Q =10 → 2Q=50 → Q=25. Then P=60-25=35. So yes, H is 35.

But let me think again. Sometimes, in these problems, people might get confused with the demand function. Wait, another approach: maybe I should check the calculation again.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of elasticity. But I think the method I used is correct.

Wait, but let me make sure I correctly converted the demand equation. The demand is Q =60 - P, so solving for P gives P=60 - Q. Yes, that's correct.

So, when Q is 25, P is 60 -25 =35.

Looking at the options, option H is 35, which would be the answer.

Hmm, but wait, I remember that sometimes, profit maximization might involve other considerations, but in this case, the firm has no fixed costs, and MC is constant. So yes, setting MR=MC is the way to go.

I think I'm confident that the correct answer is H:35.

To determine the profit-maximizing price for the monopolistic firm, we start by analyzing the given market demand curve, \( Q = 60 - P \), which can be rewritten as the inverse demand function \( P = 60 - Q \). This represents the price the firm can charge for a given quantity \( Q \).

The total revenue (TR) is calculated as \( P \times Q \), which substitutes to:

\[
TR = (60 - Q) \cdot Q = 60Q - Q^2
\]

To find the marginal revenue (MR), we take the derivative of the total revenue with respect to \( Q \):

\[
MR = \frac{d(TR)}{dQ} = 60 - 2Q
\]

At profit-maximizing equilibrium, marginal revenue equals marginal cost (MC). Given that \( MC = 10 \), we set \( MR = MC \):

\[
60 - 2Q = 10
\]

Solving for \( Q \):

\[
60 - 10 = 2Q \implies 50 = 2Q \implies Q = 25
\]

Now, substitute \( Q = 25 \) back into the inverse demand function to find the profit-maximizing price:

\[
P = 60 - Q = 60 - 25 = 35
\]

Thus, the profit-maximizing price for the firm is \( 35 \), corresponding to option H.
