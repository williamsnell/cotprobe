Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see. The question is about a ball being thrown into the air, and I need to find its velocity at a specific time. 

The problem states that the height of the ball after t seconds is given by the equation y = 40t - 16t². They're asking for the velocity when t is 2 seconds. Hmm, I remember that velocity is related to the derivative of the position function. Oh right, velocity is the first derivative of the position with respect to time.

So the position function here is y(t) = 40t - 16t². To find the velocity at any time t, I need to find dy/dt. Let me work that out. 

The derivative of 40t with respect to t is just 40, because the derivative of any at term is a. Then the derivative of -16t² is -32t, since 2 times 16 is 32, and the exponent comes down, reducing from t squared to t to the first power. So putting that together, the velocity function v(t) should be 40 - 32t.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Yeah, the derivative of t² is 2t, so 16t² becomes 32t when multiplied by the 2, and the negative sign stays. So yes, v(t) = 40 - 32t.

Now I need to evaluate this at t=2 seconds. Plugging t=2 into the velocity equation: v(2) = 40 - 32*(2). Let me compute that. 32 times 2 is 64. So 40 minus 64 equals... that's -24. Wait, that would be negative 24 feet per second. 

Hmm, but wait, looking at the answer choices, option I is -24 ft/s. So that's probably the correct answer. But wait, let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Alternative approach: Maybe I should think about the units and the physical meaning. The initial velocity is 40 ft/s upwards. The acceleration due to gravity is 32 ft/s² downward, which is why the velocity decreases by 32 every second. So after 2 seconds, the velocity would be 40 - (32 * 2) = 40 - 64 = -24 ft/s. Yep, that makes sense. Negative because it's moving downward at that point. 

Just to make sure I didn't confuse anything, let me check the options again. Option I is -24, which matches my calculation. So I think that's the right choice.

To determine the velocity of the ball at \( t = 2 \) seconds, we start with the height function:

\[
y(t) = 40t - 16t^2
\]

Velocity is the first derivative of the height function with respect to time. Taking the derivative:

\[
v(t) = \frac{dy}{dt} = 40 - 32t
\]

This gives the velocity function. Substituting \( t = 2 \) into the velocity function:

\[
v(2) = 40 - 32(2) = 40 - 64 = -24 \, \mathrm{ft/s}
\]

The negative sign indicates that the ball is moving downward at \( t = 2 \) seconds. Comparing this result to the answer choices, the correct option is:

**I: -24 ft/s**
