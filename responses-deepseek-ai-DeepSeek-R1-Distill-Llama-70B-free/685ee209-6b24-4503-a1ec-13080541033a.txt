The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man participated in a bank robbery as the driver of the getaway vehicle. The other conspirators assured him there would be no injuries or killings, but while in the bank they killed two people. Pursuant to the state's felony murder rule, the getaway driver was convicted of first degree murder, and sentenced to death. After exhausting his appeals, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear his case. He argued that he did not intend to kill and was not even present. What is the most likely holding of the Supreme Court?

Options:

A: The defendant's lack of intent to kill makes the application of the death penalty unconstitutional.
B: The Supreme Court cannot interfere with a state's application of the felony murder rule.
C: The felony murder rule is constitutional, but the defendant's execution is not justified in this case.
D: The felony murder rule is unconstitutional and the defendant's conviction must be reversed.
E: The defendant's role as a getaway driver does not justify a first degree murder charge.
F: The Eighth Amendment does not protect the defendant from execution in felony murder cases.
G: The defendant cannot be held responsible for the actions of his co-conspirators.
H: It is constitutional for a state to authorize the execution of an individual who participates in a robbery in which another robber takes life.
I: A conviction of first degree murder justifies the execution as long as aggravating circumstances are found to exist.
J: The execution of the defendant constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment and cannot be allowed.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Supreme Court question. Let me break it down.

The scenario is about a man who was the getaway driver in a bank robbery. The others killed two people inside the bank. The state's felony murder rule led to his conviction for first-degree murder and a death sentence. Now, the Supreme Court is considering his case. His argument is that he didn't intend to kill and wasn't even present when the killings happened.

I remember that felony murder is when someone dies during the commission of a felony, and all participants can be held liable for murder, even if they didn't intend or cause the death. But I'm not sure about the constitutional aspects here, especially regarding the death penalty.

So the question is about whether the Supreme Court would uphold the death penalty in this situation. The options are A through J, each presenting a different possible holding.

Looking at each option:

Option A says the defendant's lack of intent makes the death penalty unconstitutional. I think the Supreme Court has held that intent matters for murder convictions. Like, in some cases, they've ruled that a defendant must have at least some intent related to the killing. But does that apply to the death penalty specifically? I'm not sure.

Option B suggests the Supreme Court can't interfere with a state's felony murder rule. But I think the Court does have the authority to review state laws for constitutionality, especially regarding criminal procedure and the Eighth Amendment.

Option C states the felony murder rule is constitutional, but execution isn't justified here. Maybe the Court would find that while the rule itself is okay, applying it in this case to impose the death penalty is problematic, perhaps due to a lack of intent.

Option D argues the felony murder rule is unconstitutional. I don't recall the Supreme Court ever striking down the felony murder rule entirely, though they might limit its application in certain cases, especially regarding the death penalty.

Option E says his role as a getaway driver doesn't justify first-degree murder. This might relate to whether being an accomplice in a felony that results in murder can lead to first-degree murder charges. But the question is about the death penalty, so this might not be the main issue here.

Option F claims the Eighth Amendment doesn't protect him. The Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. I'm trying to remember cases where the Court considered whether the death penalty was unfairly applied. For example, in cases where the defendant didn't actually kill anyone but was convicted under felony murder.

Option G says he can't be held responsible for co-conspirators' actions. That's more about accomplice liability. But under felony murder, even if he didn't know, he could be liable. So maybe this isn't the right angle.

Option H states it's constitutional to execute someone who participated in a robbery where another robber killed someone. This seems to align with the idea that the felony murder rule allows for capital punishment if the underlying felony is serious enough. I think some states do allow this, but does the Supreme Court permit it?

Option I says first-degree murder conviction with aggravating factors justifies execution. Well, the question is more about the application of the felony murder rule leading to the death penalty, not whether the conviction itself justifies it.

Option J claims the execution is cruel and unusual. This would mean the Court finds it unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. I'm trying to recall if the Court has ruled on similar cases. I think in Enmund v. Florida, the Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits imposing the death penalty on a defendant who was a minor participant in a felony and did not kill or intend to kill. But in this case, the defendant wasn't present, so maybe it's similar.

Wait, Enmund's case: he was the getaway driver in an armed robbery where two people were murdered. The Court held that the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment if the defendant neither killed nor intended to kill, and was not the main participant. But wait, Enmund was a 1982 case where the Court reversed the death sentence because he didn't kill or intend to kill. So in that case, the Court said that capital punishment is excessive in such situations.

So applying that here, the defendant here didn't kill or intend to kill. He was the driver, not the main actor. Therefore, under Enmund, the death penalty would be unconstitutional because he didn't have the requisite intent or direct action.

Looking back at the options, option J says execution is cruel and unusual, which aligns with Enmund. Option A is about lack of intent making the death penalty unconstitutional, which is similar but not as specific as Enmund.

Wait, but the options: Option J says it's cruel and unusual, which is exactly what Enmund decided. So the correct answer would be J.

Wait, but I thought Enmund was about the proportionality of the sentence. So in that case, the defendant's role was minor, and he didn't intend the killing, so the death penalty was unconstitutional.

In this question, the defendant is the driver, so similar to Enmund. Therefore, the Supreme Court would likely hold that the execution is unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment.

So the answer should be J.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of imposing the death penalty on a getaway driver convicted of first-degree murder under the felony murder rule, where the defendant neither intended to kill nor was present during the killings. The key issue is whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits such an application of the death penalty.

Under the felony murder rule, participants in a felony can be held liable for murder if a death occurs during the commission of the crime, even if they did not directly cause or intend the death. However, the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment, imposes limits on the application of the death penalty. In *Enmund v. Florida (1982)*, the Supreme Court ruled that the Eighth Amendment forbids imposing the death penalty on a defendant who neither killed nor intended to kill and was not the primary participant in the crime. This precedent directly applies to the scenario described.

In this case, the defendant, as the getaway driver, did not kill or intend to kill, and his role was secondary to the main actors. Following *Enmund*, the Supreme Court would likely hold that the death penalty in this context constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Therefore, the execution cannot be allowed.

The correct answer is:

J: The execution of the defendant constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment and cannot be allowed.
