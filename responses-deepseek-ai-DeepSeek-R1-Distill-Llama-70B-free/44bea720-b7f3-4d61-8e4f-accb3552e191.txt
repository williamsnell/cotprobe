Okay, I'm trying to figure out what passive personality jurisdiction is. I remember that in law, especially international law, there are different principles that determine which country has the authority to try a case. I think the main ones are territoriality, nationality, universality, and maybe some others.

Wait, passive personality... I think it's related to nationality but not the offender. Oh right, active personality is when a country claims jurisdiction because its nationals commit a crime, anywhere in the world. So passive personality must be the oppositeâ€”when the victim is a national of the country, regardless of where the crime happened.

So the question is asking which option matches that. Let me look at the options.

Option D says it's based on the nationality of the victims. That sounds right. Passive personality jurisdiction means the country can prosecute someone because the victim is their citizen, even if the crime occurred elsewhere.

Other options: A is about where a legal person is registered, maybe for corporations. B is nationality of the offender, which is active personality. C is the relationship between victim and offender, not sure about that. E is severity, which might relate to other factors but not this jurisdiction. F is where planned, which is more about conspiracy maybe. G is international law, which could be universality. H is residence of offender, which is different. I is where committed, that's territorial. J is about witnesses, which I don't think is a main jurisdictional basis.

So the correct answer should be D.

Passive personality jurisdiction allows a country to assert legal authority over a case because the victim is a national of that country, regardless of where the crime occurred. This contrasts with active personality jurisdiction, which focuses on the nationality of the offender. Among the provided options, D correctly identifies this principle as being based on the nationality of the victims.

Answer: D
