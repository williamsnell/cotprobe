Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to use Stokes' Theorem to evaluate the line integral of a vector field around a triangular path. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that Stokes' Theorem relates a line integral around a closed curve to a surface integral over the surface bounded by that curve. The formula is something like the integral of F dot dr around C equals the integral of the curl of F dot dS over the surface S. So, I need to compute the curl of F first.

The vector field F is given by F(x,y,z) = xy i + yz j + zx k. To find the curl of F, I should set up the determinant of the curl operator. The curl is ( ∂Fz/∂y - ∂Fy/∂z )i + ( ∂Fx/∂z - ∂Fz/∂x )j + ( ∂Fy/∂x - ∂Fx/∂y )k.

Let me compute each component. For the i component: ∂Fz/∂y is ∂(zx)/∂y, which is zero because zx doesn't depend on y. Then ∂Fy/∂z is ∂(yz)/∂z = y. So the i component is 0 - y = -y.

For the j component: ∂Fx/∂z is ∂(xy)/∂z, which is zero, and ∂Fz/∂x is ∂(zx)/∂x = z. So j component is 0 - z = -z.

The k component: ∂Fy/∂x is ∂(yz)/∂x = 0, and ∂Fx/∂y is ∂(xy)/∂y = x. So k component is 0 - x = -x.

Putting it all together, the curl of F is (-y, -z, -x). So ∇ × F = -y i - z j - x k.

Now, according to Stokes' Theorem, the line integral equals the surface integral of (∇ × F) · dS over the surface S bounded by C.

The next step is to choose a surface S. The triangle is in 3D space with vertices at (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). It looks like this triangle lies on the plane x + y + z = 1. Let me check: plugging in each point, 1+0+0=1, 0+1+0=1, 0+0+1=1. Yep, that's correct. So the equation of the surface is x + y + z = 1, with x, y, z ≥ 0, I think. So the surface is the flat triangle on this plane.

To compute the surface integral, I can parameterize the surface. Since it's a flat triangle, I can use two variables, say x and y, and express z as 1 - x - y. So the parametrization r(x,y) = x i + y j + (1 - x - y) k, where x and y are within the triangle's projection onto the xy-plane. Wait, but the projection might be a triangle with x ≥0, y≥0, and x + y ≤1.

Now, I need to compute the surface integral. The integral of (∇ × F) · dS can be expressed as the double integral over the projection D in the xy-plane of (∇ × F) · (r_x × r_y) dA, where r_x and r_y are the partial derivatives of r with respect to x and y.

Alternatively, since the surface is part of a plane, I can compute the unit normal vector and then express dS in terms of dx dy. But perhaps using the parametrization method is clearer.

Wait, let's first compute r_x and r_y. 

r_x is the partial derivative of r with respect to x: that's i - 0 j -1 k (because derivative of z with respect to x is -1). Similarly, r_y is 0 i + j -1 k. So r_x × r_y is the cross product of these two vectors.

Let me compute that cross product. The vectors are (1, 0, -1) and (0, 1, -1). The cross product is the determinant:

i  j  k
1  0 -1
0  1 -1

So i*(0*(-1) - (-1)*1) - j*(1*(-1) - (-1)*0) + k*(1*1 - 0*0). 

Simplify each component:

i: (0 - (-1)) = 1 → i*1 = i
j: - [ (-1) - 0 ] = - (-1) = +1 → j*1 = j
k: (1 - 0) =1 → k*1 =k
So r_x × r_y = (1, 1, 1). 

But wait, the cross product's magnitude is the area scaling factor, but for the surface integral, we take the dot product with the curl F. Also, the orientation matters. Since the curve C is oriented counterclockwise when viewed from above, I think the normal vector should point upwards, which would be in the direction of (1,1,1), but I need to check the orientation.

Wait, the cross product r_x × r_y gives a vector normal to the surface. The z-component is positive (1), so it points upward, which is correct because when looking from above (positive z direction), counterclockwise is the right orientation. So the normal vector is (1,1,1), but wait, this is the actual cross product vector, but for the surface integral, I think we need the unit normal. Or perhaps just use the vector as is, since the area element's magnitude is included.

Wait, no. The formula is (∇ × F) · (r_x × r_y) dx dy. So the cross product r_x × r_y gives a vector whose magnitude is the area of the parallelogram, and direction is the normal. So for the integral, we just take the dot product without normalizing.

So now, let's compute (∇ × F) · (r_x × r_y). We have ∇ × F = (-y, -z, -x). The cross product vector is (1,1,1). So the dot product is (-y)(1) + (-z)(1) + (-x)(1) = -x - y - z.

But wait, our parametrization has z = 1 - x - y. So substituting z into the expression: -x - y - (1 - x - y) = -x - y -1 + x + y = -1.

Wait, that's interesting. The dot product simplifies to -1. So the integral becomes the double integral over D of (-1) dx dy, where D is the region in the xy-plane where x ≥0, y ≥0, and x + y ≤1.

So the integral is simply the area of D multiplied by -1. But D is a right triangle with legs of length 1. The area is (1 * 1)/2 = 1/2. So the integral is (-1) * (1/2) = -1/2.

Wait, but Stokes' theorem says the line integral equals this surface integral, which is -1/2. But the options given are A: -1/2, B: 1/2, etc. So is the answer A?

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the parametrization or the cross product.

Wait, wait. The cross product of r_x and r_y is (1,1,1). Then, ∇ × F is (-y, -z, -x). So the dot product is (-y)(1) + (-z)(1) + (-x)(1) = -x - y - z.

But in the parametrization, z = 1 - x - y. So substituting, it's -x - y - (1 - x - y) = -x - y -1 +x + y = -1. So that part seems right.

The area D is the region x ≥0, y ≥0, x + y ≤1. The area is indeed 1/2. So the integral is (-1) * (1/2) = -1/2.

Wait, but the line integral is the same as the surface integral, so the answer would be -1/2, which is option A.

Wait another thing: the orientation. The cross product r_x × r_y gives (1,1,1), which points upwards. The curve C is oriented counterclockwise when viewed from above, which is the same as the positive z direction, so the normal vector direction is correct. So the sign should be correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure about the parametrization and the limits. So in the parametrization, x and y go from 0 to 1, but with x + y ≤1. So when integrating, the integrand is -1, so the integral is -1 times the area of D, which is 1/2. So yes, -1/2.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is -1/2, which would be the answer. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when applying Stokes' theorem, the orientation of the surface's normal and the curve's direction must agree. The curve is oriented counterclockwise when viewed from above, so the normal should point upwards, which it does in our case. So the sign should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the curl calculation. Let me double-check that. The curl of F is (∂Fz/∂y - ∂Fy/∂z, ∂Fx/∂z - ∂Fz/∂x, ∂Fy/∂x - ∂Fx/∂y).

So, F = xy i + yz j + zx k.

∂Fz/∂y = ∂(zx)/∂y = 0.

∂Fy/∂z = ∂(yz)/∂z = y.

So first component is 0 - y = -y.

Second component: ∂Fx/∂z = ∂(xy)/∂z = 0.

∂Fz/∂x = ∂(zx)/∂x = z.

So second component is 0 - z = -z.

Third component: ∂Fy/∂x = ∂(yz)/∂x = 0.

∂Fx/∂y = ∂(xy)/∂y = x.

So third component is 0 - x = -x.

Yes, so ∇ × F = (-y, -z, -x). That seems correct.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the curve is oriented counterclockwise when viewed from above, which would mean the normal vector points in the positive z direction. So the cross product r_x × r_y should be in the positive z direction. In our case, the cross product was (1,1,1), which does have a positive z component. So that's correct.

So the integral of (∇ × F) · dS = integral over D of (-1) dA = - area(D) = -1/2.

So the line integral is -1/2, which is option A.

But wait, I'm looking at the options and option A is -1/2. So that's the answer. Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think if I got the curl correct. Because sometimes the curl can be tricky.

Another approach: perhaps compute the line integral directly and see if it matches. But that might take longer.

Alternatively, maybe I've made a mistake in the parametrization. Wait, the surface integral is ∫∫ (∇ × F) · n dS, where n is the unit normal. But in our case, we computed (∇ × F) · (r_x × r_y) dx dy, which is correct because dS = |r_x × r_y| dx dy, but when you have (∇ × F) · (r_x × r_y) dx dy, the magnitude is included in r_x × r_y. Wait, no, actually, the surface integral is ∫∫ (∇ × F) · (r_x × r_y) dx dy, without the magnitude. Because (∇ × F) is a vector field, and (r_x × r_y) gives the normal vector, but not necessarily a unit vector. So the formula is correct as is.

So, to recap, the integral becomes ∫∫ (-1) dx dy, integrated over the region D which is the triangle in the first quadrant with x + y ≤1. The integral is (-1) * area(D) = (-1)*(1/2) = -1/2. So the line integral is -1/2, so the answer is option A.

To evaluate the line integral $\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}$ using Stokes' Theorem, we first compute the curl of the vector field $\mathbf{F}(x, y, z) = xy \mathbf{i} + yz \mathbf{j} + zx \mathbf{k}$. The curl is given by:

\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \\
xy & yz & zx
\end{vmatrix}.
\]

Computing each component:
- The $\mathbf{i}$-component is $\frac{\partial (zx)}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial (yz)}{\partial z} = 0 - y = -y$.
- The $\mathbf{j}$-component is $\frac{\partial (xy)}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial (zx)}{\partial x} = 0 - z = -z$.
- The $\mathbf{k}$-component is $\frac{\partial (yz)}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial (xy)}{\partial y} = 0 - x = -x$.

Thus, $\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = -y \mathbf{i} - z \mathbf{j} - x \mathbf{k}$.

Next, we apply Stokes' Theorem, which relates the line integral to the surface integral of the curl over the surface $S$ bounded by $C$. The triangular curve $C$ lies on the plane $x + y + z = 1$, with vertices $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$. We parametrize the surface as:

\[
\mathbf{r}(x, y) = x \mathbf{i} + y \mathbf{j} + (1 - x - y) \mathbf{k}, \quad x \geq 0, y \geq 0, x + y \leq 1.
\]

The partial derivatives are:
- $\mathbf{r}_x = \mathbf{i} - \mathbf{k}$,
- $\mathbf{r}_y = \mathbf{j} - \mathbf{k}$.

The cross product $\mathbf{r}_x \times \mathbf{r}_y$ is:

\[
\mathbf{r}_x \times \mathbf{r}_y = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 0 & -1 \\
0 & 1 & -1
\end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(0 - (-1)) - \mathbf{j}(1 - 0) + \mathbf{k}(1 - 0) = \mathbf{i} + \mathbf{j} + \mathbf{k}.
\]

The surface integral becomes:

\[
\int_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot d\mathbf{S} = \iint_D (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot (\mathbf{r}_x \times \mathbf{r}_y) \, dx \, dy.
\]

Substituting $\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = -y \mathbf{i} - z \mathbf{j} - x \mathbf{k}$ and $\mathbf{r}_x \times \mathbf{r}_y = \mathbf{i} + \mathbf{j} + \mathbf{k}$, the dot product is:

\[
(-y)(1) + (-z)(1) + (-x)(1) = -x - y - z.
\]

Using the parametrization $z = 1 - x - y$, this simplifies to:

\[
-x - y - (1 - x - y) = -1.
\]

Thus, the surface integral reduces to:

\[
\iint_D -1 \, dx \, dy = -\iint_D dx \, dy.
\]

The region $D$ is the projection of the triangle onto the $xy$-plane, which is a right triangle with legs of length 1. The area of $D$ is:

\[
\text{Area of } D = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Therefore, the surface integral is:

\[
-\int_D dx \, dy = -\frac{1}{2}.
\]

By Stokes' Theorem, the line integral $\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}$ equals the surface integral, which is $-\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the answer is:

**A: $-\frac{1}{2}$**
