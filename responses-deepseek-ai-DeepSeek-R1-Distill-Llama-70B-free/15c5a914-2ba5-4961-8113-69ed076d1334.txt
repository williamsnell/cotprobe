Question:

A property owner owned a large building in the city. The owner leased the building to a shopkeeper for a period of 20 years at a rental of $10,000 per month. The leasehold agreement between property owner and shopkeeper provided that the latter was not permitted "to assign this lease to anyone except a corporation with an A' credit rating from a well- known credit rating company. " One month later, the shopkeeper leased the premises to a corporation that did not have the required credit rating. The shopkeeper-corporation lease was for a period of five years, with a rental of $15,000 per month, payable by the corporation to the shopkeeper. In addition, the corporation agreed to abide "by all of the terms and conditions of the lease between the property owner and the shopkeeper. "One year later, the corporation leased the premises to a non-profit organization for the balance of the term of the corporation shopkeeper lease. The non-profit organization took possession of the said premises the same day that the corporation vacated its occupancy. Pursuant to the corporation nonprofit leasehold agreement, the latter was obligated to pay a monthly rental of $17,500 directly to the corporation. The non-profit organization has a B' credit rating with the well-known credit rating company. Which of the following is not correct regarding the legal relationship(s) of the various parties?

Options:

A: Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the property owner and the non-profit organization.
B: Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the corporation and the non-profit organization.
C: Privity of contract, but not privity of estate, exists between the shopkeeper and the non-profit organization.
D: Privity of estate and privity of contract exist between the property owner and the shopkeeper.
E: Privily of estate, but not privily of contract, exists between property owner and the corporation.
F: Neither privity of estate nor privity of contract exists between the shopkeeper and the non-profit organization.
G: Neither privily of estate nor privily of contract exists between the property owner and the nonprofit organization.
H: Neither privity of estate nor privity of contract exists between the corporation and the non-profit organization.
I: Privily of estate and privity of contract exist between the shopkeeper and the corporation.
J: Privity of contract, but not privity of estate, exists between the property owner and the corporation.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's start by reading through the problem carefully.

So, there's a property owner who leased a building to a shopkeeper for 20 years at $10,000 a month. The lease says the shopkeeper can't assign it except to a corporation with an 'A' credit rating. Then, a month later, the shopkeeper leased the premises to a corporation without the required credit rating. Wait, that's a problem because the lease agreement prohibits assigning to anyone except a corporation with an 'A' rating. So, the shopkeeper is violating the lease terms here.

The shopkeeper and the corporation have a 5-year lease at $15k a month. The corporation agrees to abide by all terms of the original lease. So, the corporation is stepping into the shopkeeper's shoes, but the assignment is prohibited, right? So, maybe this is an assignment without permission, which could be a breach of the lease.

Then, a year later, the corporation leases to a non-profit for the remaining term. The non-profit has a 'B' rating and pays $17.5k a month to the corporation. The non-profit takes over immediately when the corporation leaves.

The question is about the legal relationships, specifically privity of estate and privity of contract between various parties.

I remember that privity of contract exists when two parties have a contractual relationship. Privity of estate exists when two parties have a landlord-tenant relationship.

So let's map out the relationships:

1. Property Owner and Shopkeeper: Original lease. They have both privity of contract (the lease is a contract) and privity of estate (landlord and tenant). So any option saying they don't have either would be incorrect.

2. Shopkeeper and Corporation: The shopkeeper assigned the lease without permission because the corporation doesn't have an 'A' rating. So is this a valid assignment or not? The lease prohibits assignment except to 'A' corporations. So the assignment is in breach of the lease terms. But does that mean it's invalid, or just that the shopkeeper is in breach? I think it's a breach, but the assignment might still be effective unless the lease says any assignment without permission is void. But typically, a lease might have a clause that requires the landlord's consent, and if given without consent, it's a breach but the assignment is still valid. So, the shopkeeper and corporation have a lease agreement, so privity of contract exists. As for privity of estate, since the corporation is now in possession, they have a landlord-tenant relationship with the shopkeeper. So they have both privity of contract and privity of estate.

Wait, but if the assignment was prohibited and done without consent, does that affect the privity? Or does it just make the shopkeeper in breach? I think the assignment is still effective, so the shopkeeper and corporation have both privities.

3. Corporation and Non-Profit: The corporation leased to the non-profit for the remainder of their term. So, the non-profit is a subtenant. So the corporation and non-profit have a lease agreement, which is a contract. So privity of contract exists. And since the non-profit is in possession, they have privity of estate between them too.

4. Property Owner and Corporation: The original lease was between the owner and shopkeeper. The shopkeeper assigned to the corporation without permission. Now, in terms of privity, does the property owner have any direct relationship with the corporation? Typically, if the assignment is done without the landlord's consent, the landlord's privity is still with the original tenant (shopkeeper). So the property owner isn't in privity of contract with the corporation, because the lease is with the shopkeeper. But wait, the corporation agreed to abide by all terms of the original lease. Does that create a new contract between the owner and corporation? Probably not automatically. The corporation is now holding over under the original lease, but the property owner can choose to accept them as a tenant or not. Without the owner's consent, the corporation is an assignee in breach, but the owner can either terminate or accept the new tenant.

So, in terms of privity, the owner doesn't have privity of contract with the corporation, unless the owner has accepted the assignment, which isn't stated here. So, the property owner and the corporation don't have a contract. However, if the corporation is now in possession, does that create a tenancy at will or something? I'm not sure. But I think without the owner's consent, the privity remains between owner and shopkeeper, not owner and corporation. So, privity of contract doesn't exist between owner and corporation. As for privity of estate, the corporation is in possession, so maybe there's a privity of estate, but without a contract, it's a tenancy at sufferance or something, which might not count as privity of estate. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, privity of estate refers to the legal relationship where one is the landlord and the other is the tenant. So if the corporation is in possession, then they are the tenant of the property owner. But if the assignment was without consent, then perhaps the property owner can treat them as a tenant at sufferance, meaning there's no contract, but they are in possession. So in that case, there's privity of estate (they're landlord and tenant, even if it's a tenancy at sufferance), but no privity of contract. So, the property owner and corporation would have privity of estate but not contract.

Wait, but some sources say that privity of estate arises from a lease, which is a contract. So, without a contract, maybe there's no privity of estate. Alternatively, maybe they're in a tenancy at will, but that's a type of estate. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In the original lease, the shopkeeper is the tenant. They assign to the corporation without permission. If the assignment is in breach, then the shopkeeper is still liable, but the corporation is now the tenant, holding over. So, the property owner could choose to accept the corporation as tenant, which would create a new tenancy, or evict them. If the owner doesn't accept, then the corporation is a tenant at sufferance, which is a type of estate without a contract. So, in that case, there would be privity of estate (they're landlord and tenant), but no privity of contract because there's no lease agreement between them.

So, for the property owner and the corporation, privity of estate exists (because the corporation is in possession as a tenant, even if unlawfully), but no privity of contract. So any option that says they have both would be wrong, or if they have neither, that would be wrong.

5. Property Owner and Non-Profit: The non-profit is a subtenant of the corporation. The property owner's lease is with the shopkeeper, who assigned to the corporation without consent. The corporation then subleases to the non-profit. So, the property owner doesn't have a direct lease with the non-profit. Therefore, there's no privity of contract between the owner and non-profit. As for privity of estate, the non-profit is in possession, but they're a subtenant, so the privity of estate is between the corporation and the non-profit, but not the owner and non-profit. So, between owner and non-profit, there's neither privity of contract nor privity of estate. So any option that says they have either would be wrong.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Privity of estate and contract between owner and non-profit. That's incorrect because they don't have any.

Option B: Between corporation and non-profit, both exist. Correct, because they have a lease.

Option C: Between shopkeeper and non-profit, privity of contract but not estate. Wait, the shopkeeper's lease is with the corporation, and the non-profit is subleased from the corporation. So the shopkeeper and non-profit don't have a direct contract. So no privity of contract. So option C is incorrect because it says there's privity of contract. So C is wrong.

Option D: Owner and shopkeeper have both. Correct.

Option E: Owner and corporation have privity of estate but not contract. That seems correct based on earlier analysis. So E is correct.

Option F: Neither exists between shopkeeper and non-profit. That's correct because they don't have a contract or estate. So F is correct.

Option G: Neither exists between owner and non-profit. Correct.

Option H: Neither between corporation and non-profit. Incorrect, because B says they do, and B is correct.

Option I: Shopkeeper and corporation have both. Correct.

Option J: Owner and corporation have contract but not estate. Incorrect because earlier analysis says they have estate but not contract.

Now, the question is which option is not correct. Let's go through each option.

Looking at the options, the question is which is not correct.

Option C says privity of contract exists between shopkeeper and non-profit, but not estate. But in reality, there's no contract between them, so C is wrong.

Wait, let me make sure. The shopkeeper's lease is to the corporation, and the corporation's lease is to the non-profit. The shopkeeper and non-profit have no direct lease. So, no privity of contract or estate between them. So option C is incorrect because it says there's privity of contract, which there isn't.

Another option is E, which says owner and corporation have estate but not contract. That's correct.

Option J says owner and corporation have contract but not estate. That's incorrect because, as discussed, they have estate but not contract.

Wait, but earlier I thought that without a contract, there's no privity of contract. So J is incorrect.

Wait, the question is which option is not correct. So, all the options that are correct are true, and the incorrect one is the answer.

Wait, the options are about which is not correct.

So, let's re-examine the options.

Option E: Privity of estate, but not contract, exists between property owner and corporation. Is that correct? If the corporation is in possession without a lease, the owner and corporation have a tenancy at sufferance, which is a type of estate. So yes, estate exists, but no contract. So E is correct.

Option J: Privity of contract, but not estate, exists between owner and corporation. That's incorrect because there's no contract, but estate exists. So J is the incorrect statement.

Wait, but the original lease between owner and shopkeeper was a contract. The corporation is now holding over without a new contract. So, the owner and corporation don't have a contract. So J is wrong.

Looking back, the question asks which option is not correct.

So, which options are incorrect:

A: Incorrect (no privity between owner and non-profit).

B: Correct (corporation and non-profit have both).

C: Incorrect (shopkeeper and non-profit have neither).

D: Correct.

E: Correct.

F: Correct (shopkeeper and non-profit have neither).

G: Correct (owner and non-profit have neither).

H: Incorrect (corporation and non-profit have both, so H is wrong).

I: Correct.

J: Incorrect (owner and corporation have estate, not contract; J says contract without estate, which is wrong).

So the question is to find which option is not correct, meaning which is false.

The possible incorrect options are A, C, H, J.

Now, looking at the options, the correct answer is the one that's not correct.

The question is, which is not correct regarding the legal relationships.

So, for example, option A says that the owner and non-profit have both privities. That's incorrect because they have neither.

Option C says shopkeeper and non-profit have contract but not estate. That's incorrect because they have neither.

Option J says owner and corporation have contract but not estate. That's incorrect because they have estate but not contract.

So the question is which is not correct. So any of these options (A, C, J) would be incorrect.

Looking back at the options, the question asks which is not correct.

Wait, let's make sure.

Option C: Privity of contract, but not estate, exists between shopkeeper and non-profit.

But in reality, the shopkeeper and non-profit have no contract. The shopkeeper's contract is with the corporation, and the non-profit's is with the corporation. So between shopkeeper and non-profit, there's no contract, so option C is incorrect.

Similarly, option J: owner and corporation have contract (no, they don't; the contract is with the shopkeeper) but not estate (no, they do have estate). So J is incorrect.

So, which of these is one of the options that is not correct.

The options given are multiple, but the question asks which is not correct.

Wait, let's list each option's correctness.

Option A: Incorrect.

Option B: Correct.

Option C: Incorrect.

Option D: Correct.

Option E: Correct.

Option F: Correct.

Option G: Correct.

Option H: Incorrect.

Option I: Correct.

Option J: Incorrect.

The question is which option is not correct, i.e., which statement is false.

So the incorrect options are A, C, H, J.

Now, the question is, which of the options is not correct, so which one is false.

The options are:

A: Privity of estate and contract between owner and non-profit. False.

B: Correct.

C: Privity of contract but not estate between shopkeeper and non-profit. False.

D: Correct.

E: Correct.

F: Correct.

G: Correct.

H: Incorrect.

I: Correct.

J: Incorrect.

So the possible answers are A, C, H, J.

Wait, the options in the problem are A through J, and the answer is to choose which is not correct.

Looking back at the options, the question is about the legal relationships.

Now, the correct answer would be the option that is not correct, i.e., the false statement.

Let me think again about each option.

Option E: Privity of estate, but not contract, exists between owner and corporation. Correct.

Option J: Privity of contract, but not estate, exists between owner and corporation. Incorrect because they have estate but not contract.

So option J is incorrect.

Option C: Privity of contract exists between shopkeeper and non-profit. No, because they don't have any contract. So C is incorrect.

Option F: Neither exists between shopkeeper and non-profit. Correct.

So which of the options is not correct? The question is to find the incorrect statement.

Looking at the options, the problem is which is not correct.

So, the options that are incorrect are A, C, H, J.

But in the options given, the possible answers are A-J.

The question is, which of the options is not correct.

So, for example, let's evaluate each option.

Option A: The owner and non-profit have both. No, they have neither. So A is wrong.

Option B: Corporation and non-profit have both. Correct.

Option C: Shopkeeper and non-profit have contract but not estate. No, they have neither. So C is wrong.

Option D: Owner and shopkeeper have both. Correct.

Option E: Owner and corporation have estate but not contract. Correct.

Option F: Shopkeeper and non-profit have neither. Correct.

Option G: Owner and non-profit have neither. Correct.

Option H: Corporation and non-profit have neither. Incorrect, because they do have both. So H is wrong.

Option I: Shopkeeper and corporation have both. Correct.

Option J: Owner and corporation have contract but not estate. Incorrect, because they have estate but not contract.

So now, the question is which option is not correct. So the answer could be any of A, C, H, J.

But the question is a multiple-choice with only one correct answer, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, the question asks which is not correct regarding the legal relationships.

I think I need to re-examine each option carefully.

Option A: Privity of estate and contract exist between owner and non-profit. This is incorrect because they have neither.

Option B: Correct.

Option C: Privity of contract exists between shopkeeper and non-profit. No, they don't have a contract. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Correct.

Option E: Correct.

Option F: Correct.

Option G: Correct.

Option H: Incorrect.

Option I: Correct.

Option J: Incorrect.

But the options are multiple-choice, so only one is correct as the answer.

Wait, but the question is phrased as which option is not correct.

So, for example, if option E is correct, then it's not the answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing whether the owner and corporation have privity of estate.

In the original lease, the owner leased to the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper assigned to the corporation without permission. So, in the eyes of the law, the corporation is now the tenant, but without the owner's consent. So, the owner can either accept them or evict. If they don't evict, they might be deemed to have accepted, creating a new tenancy. But the problem doesn't state that the owner accepted the corporation. So, the corporation is a tenant at sufferance, which is a type of estate without a lease. So, there's privity of estate but not contract.

Thus, option E is correct.

Option J says owner and corporation have privity of contract but not estate. That's incorrect because they have estate but not contract.

So, option J is incorrect.

Similarly, option C is incorrect because there's no contract between shopkeeper and non-profit.

But the question is which option is not correct. So, the correct answer to the question is the option that is incorrect.

Wait, the problem is asking which option is not correct, meaning which statement is false.

So, the false statements are options A, C, H, J.

Now, let's go through each option again.

Option A: Owner and non-profit have both. No, they have neither. So A is a wrong statement.

Option B: Correct.

Option C: Shopkeeper and non-profit have contract but not estate. No, they have neither. So C is wrong.

Option D: Correct.

Option E: Correct.

Option F: Correct.

Option G: Correct.

Option H: Corporation and non-profit have neither. No, they have both. So H is wrong.

Option I: Correct.

Option J: Owner and corporation have contract but not estate. No, they have estate but not contract. So J is wrong.

So, the question is which is not correct. So any of A, C, H, J is not correct.

But the options are given as A-J, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing the privity between the shopkeeper and the non-profit.

Wait, the shopkeeper leased to the corporation, and the corporation subleased to the non-profit. So, the shopkeeper and non-profit don't have a direct lease. So, there's no privity of contract or estate between them. So option C, which claims there's a privity of contract, is incorrect.

So
