Okay, so I've got this question about transmission lines, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a low-loss transmission line operating at 400 MHz with air as the dielectric. It says to assume negligible attenuation and that the characteristic impedance is 50 ohms. I need to calculate three things: (a) the reflection coefficient Γ, (b) the VSWR, and (c) the wavelength of the transmitted signal. Then, I have to pick the correct option from A to J.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. Oh wait, the problem statement says it's a low-loss line with air as the dielectric. But the problem doesn't mention anything about a load or the conditions at the end of the line. Hmm, that's confusing. Because the reflection coefficient depends on the load impedance. Oh, wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because the question doesn't provide the load impedance. Hmm, maybe it's assuming something else, like a matched load or a short circuit? Or perhaps I'm misreading the question.

Wait, looking again, the question says it's used for radio transmission. So perhaps the line is connected to an antenna, which probably has a certain impedance. But without knowing the load impedance, I can't calculate the reflection coefficient or VSWR. Oh, but wait, perhaps the problem is missing some information, or maybe it's testing something else. Alternatively, maybe the reflection coefficient is zero because it's matched, but that doesn't seem right because then VSWR would be 1, but none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is only about the wavelength in part (c), and parts (a) and (b) are about a different scenario. Oh wait, no, the question says "calculate" all three, so I'm probably missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem assumes a certain load condition, like a mismatched load, perhaps a short circuit? Or maybe it's a different setup. Alternatively, perhaps the reflection coefficient is given as zero, but none of the options have that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives the reflection coefficient in terms of the characteristic impedance and some other parameters. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is only about the wavelength, and the other parts are distractions. But the options include all three parameters, so I must have to compute all three.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the wavelength without knowing the other parts. Let me focus on part (c) first because that might be straightforward.

So the frequency is 400 MHz, which is 400 x 10^6 Hz. The speed of light in a medium is given by c = f * λ, but when it's not in a vacuum, it's c = f λ / sqrt(ε_r), where ε_r is the relative permittivity of the dielectric. Here, the dielectric is air, which has ε_r ≈ 1. So the wavelength λ in air is c / f.

Wait, but wait. The speed of a wave in a transmission line is v = 1 / sqrt(μ ε). For air, μ is μ0 and ε is ε0, so v = 1/sqrt(μ0 ε0) = c ≈ 3e8 m/s.

So the wavelength λ is c / f. Let me compute that.

f = 400 MHz = 400e6 Hz.

λ = c / f = (3e8 m/s) / (400e6 Hz) = 3e8 / 4e8 = 0.75 meters.

Wait, 3e8 divided by 4e8 is 0.75. So the wavelength is 0.75 meters. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Wavelength = 0.75 m.

Option C: 0.78 m.

Option E: 0.68 m.

So part (c) is 0.75 m, which would point me towards option B or maybe another one if I made a mistake.

But wait, what about the other parts? Because option B has a reflection coefficient of 0.80 at -61.75 degrees and VSWR of 9.0.

But wait, without knowing the load impedance, I can't compute Γ and VSWR. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me read it again.

Ah, wait! Oh! The problem says "a low loss transmission line... with air as dielectric media, is used for radio transmission." But it doesn't mention whether the line is matched or not. Hmm. Because if it's matched, then Γ is zero, VSWR is 1, but none of the options have that. So perhaps the question is only about the wavelength, and the other parts are not to be calculated? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait another thought: Maybe the problem is asking about the reflection coefficient when the line is terminated in a certain load, but perhaps that load isn't given. Alternatively, perhaps it's a trick question where the reflection coefficient is given as zero, but that's not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in reading the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is about a line that's not terminated properly, like an open or short circuit. But again, without that information, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the transmission line is terminated in a load that causes maximum reflection, but that's not indicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only about calculating the wavelength, and the other parts are extra, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem gave more information that I'm not seeing. Wait, let me reread the question.

The question says: "A low loss transmission line, operating at a frequency of 400MHz, with air as dielectric media, is used for radio transmission. Assuming negligible attenuation and 50Ω characteristic impedance, calculate: (a) Reflection coefficient Γ (b) VSWR and (c) Wavelength of the transmitted signal."

Wait, so the line has a characteristic impedance of 50 ohms. But without knowing the load impedance, I can't find Γ or VSWR. Unless there's some assumption here. Perhaps the load is a different impedance, like an antenna with a different impedance. But without knowing that, I can't compute Γ.

Wait, maybe the problem is a standard one where the line is connected to a load that's purely resistive, but again, without the value, I can't compute it. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only about the wavelength, and the rest is extraneous. But the options include all three parameters, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: Maybe the problem is actually not giving enough information, but perhaps parts (a) and (b) are standard cases, like when the line is shorted or open. But without that, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe the reflection coefficient is given as 0.2, but that's not in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some key formula here.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about what's required. The problem gives the frequency, so part (c) is straightforward. I've calculated that the wavelength is 0.75 meters, which is option B. Now, looking at option B: reflection coefficient is 0.80 at -61.75 degrees, VSWR is 9.0.

Wait, but how does that relate? I can't compute Γ without the load impedance. Unless the question assumes a certain load, perhaps the load is something else. Oh wait, perhaps the line is terminated in an impedance that's not 50 ohms, but perhaps another value, but without knowing that, I can't compute Γ.

Wait, perhaps there's a misprint in the question, and it's supposed to provide the load impedance. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the line is terminated in a short circuit. Let's test that scenario.

Assuming the line is terminated in a short circuit (ZL = 0), then the reflection coefficient Γ is given by (ZL - Z0)/(ZL + Z0) = (0 - 50)/(0 +50) = -1. So Γ would be -1, which would mean a reflection coefficient of magnitude 1 and angle 180 degrees. But none of the options have that. So that can't be the case.

Alternatively, if the line is open-circuited (ZL = infinity), then Γ is (inf - 50)/(inf +50) ≈ 1. So Γ is 1, but again, none of the options have that. So perhaps the termination is something else.

Wait, but none of the options have Γ as -1 or 1. So perhaps the problem is giving different parameters, but I'm not seeing the load impedance. So maybe this is a trick question where parts (a) and (b) are not computable with the given data, and only part (c) is, which is 0.75 meters. So the correct option would have the wavelength as 0.75, which is option B.

But then, option B has Γ=0.80 at -61.75 degrees, VSWR=9.0. Let me compute what would cause these values. Let's see: The reflection coefficient Γ is given by (ZL - Z0)/(ZL + Z0). The magnitude is 0.8. So:

|Γ| = 0.8 = |(ZL - 50)/(ZL +50)|.

So, solving for ZL:

0.8 = |(ZL-50)/(ZL+50)|.

Assuming ZL is real and positive (since it's a resistive load), we can drop the absolute value.

So,

0.8 = (ZL -50)/(ZL +50).

Cross-multiplying:

0.8 (ZL +50) = ZL -50.

0.8 ZL + 40 = ZL -50.

Bring terms together:

40 +50 = ZL - 0.8 ZL.

90 = 0.2 ZL.

ZL = 90 / 0.2 = 450 ohms.

So the load impedance is 450 ohms.

Now, the VSWR is (1 + |Γ|)/(1 - |Γ|) = (1 + 0.8)/(1 - 0.8) = 1.8/0.2 = 9.0. Which matches option B's VSWR of 9.0.

So, if the load impedance is 450 ohms, then Γ is 0.8, and VSWR is 9.0. But the problem doesn't mention the load impedance, so I'm confused about how to get these values without that information.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a standard one, but I'm missing the point. Maybe the line is being used in a certain way, like as a quarter-wave transformer or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the line length is an integer multiple of the wavelength, but without knowing the length, I can't see how that would affect it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the input impedance of a certain length of line when terminated in a load. But without the length, I can't compute that either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let me focus on what I can compute. I can compute the wavelength, which is 0.75 meters, which is option B. Then, looking at the other parameters in option B, they fit a scenario where ZL is 450 ohms. But since the problem doesn't provide ZL, I'm not sure how they arrived at these values. Maybe the question had a typo and omitted the load impedance, but given the options, I have to choose based on what I can compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only about the wavelength, and the other parts are not needed. But since the options require all three, I have to go with the option that correctly has the wavelength as 0.75 meters, which is option B.

But wait, there's another thought: The phase angle of the reflection coefficient is given as -61.75 degrees in some options. Let me think about how that comes about. The reflection coefficient's phase depends on the distance from the load to the point where the reflection is measured, but again, without knowing the length, I can't compute that. So maybe the problem is assuming a certain length, but that's not provided.

In summary, I think the only part I can confidently compute is the wavelength, which is 0.75 meters, pointing to option B. The other parts require information not provided in the question, so perhaps the problem intended only for the wavelength to be considered, but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a key piece of information or assumption that's needed to compute Γ and VSWR without the load impedance. But I can't see how that's possible, so I'll proceed with the wavelength as the basis for selecting option B.

The problem involves a low-loss transmission line operating at 400 MHz with air as the dielectric medium, a characteristic impedance of 50Ω, and negligible attenuation. The task is to calculate the reflection coefficient (Γ), the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), and the wavelength of the transmitted signal. 

### Analysis:

1. **Wavelength Calculation (Part c):**  
   The wavelength in a medium is given by:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{v}{f}
   \]  
   where \(v\) is the wave velocity in the medium and \(f\) is the operating frequency. For air, the relative permittivity (\(\varepsilon_r\)) is approximately 1, so the wave velocity \(v \approx c\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light in a vacuum. Substituting \(f = 400 \, \text{MHz} = 400 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz}\):  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{400 \times 10^6} = 0.75 \, \text{meters}.
   \]  
   This matches the wavelength given in **Option B**.

2. **Reflection Coefficient (\(\Gamma\)) and VSWR (Parts a and b):**  
   The reflection coefficient is calculated using:  
   \[
   \Gamma = \frac{Z_L - Z_0}{Z_L + Z_0},
   \]  
   where \(Z_0 = 50 \, \Omega\) is the characteristic impedance and \(Z_L\) is the load impedance. The VSWR is related to the reflection coefficient by:  
   \[
   \text{VSWR} = \frac{1 + |\Gamma|}{1 - |\Gamma|}.
   \]  
   However, the problem does not specify the load impedance (\(Z_L\)), making it impossible to directly compute \(\Gamma\) and VSWR.  

   Despite this, **Option B** provides values of \(\Gamma = 0.80\) at \(-61.75^\circ\) and \(\text{VSWR} = 9.0\). These values are consistent with a load impedance of \(Z_L = 450 \, \Omega\), as shown below:  
   - Solving \(|\Gamma| = 0.80\) gives:  
     \[
     0.80 = \frac{|Z_L - 50|}{Z_L + 50}.
     \]  
     Solving yields \(Z_L = 450 \, \Omega\).  
   - Substituting \(|\Gamma| = 0.80\) into the VSWR formula gives:  
     \[
     \text{VSWR} = \frac{1 + 0.80}{1 - 0.80} = 9.0.
     \]  

   While the problem does not explicitly provide \(Z_L\), the values in **Option B** are internally consistent and match the calculated wavelength.

### Conclusion:  
The wavelength is definitively calculated as \(0.75 \, \text{meters}\), which corresponds to **Option B**. Although the reflection coefficient and VSWR cannot be directly computed without the load impedance, the values provided in **Option B** are consistent with a load impedance of \(450 \, \Omega\). Therefore, **Option B** is the most appropriate choice.

**Answer: B**
