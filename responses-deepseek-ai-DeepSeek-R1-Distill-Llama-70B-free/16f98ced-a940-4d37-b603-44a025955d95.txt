Okay, so I have this physics problem here about alpha particles being deflected by a gold foil. Hmm, I remember that the Rutherford scattering experiment is related to this. The question is asking for the fraction of 7.7-MeV alpha particles that get deflected at 90 degrees or more from a gold foil of thickness 10^-6 meters. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Alright, let's break this down. I think I need to use the Rutherford scattering formula to find the scattering cross-section for a given angle, and then relate that to the fraction of particles deflected. The formula for the differential cross-section in Rutherford scattering is (dσ/dΩ) = ( (α²) / (4 * ε₀² * (4 * π * ε₀ * (ke^2 / (4 * π * ε₀ r))^2)) )) * (1/sin^4(θ/2)) ) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should recall the formula more accurately.

Wait, the Rutherford differential cross-section is given by (dσ/dΩ) = ( (α²) / (4 * (E_kin))^2 ) * (1 / sin^4(θ/2)) ) where α is the fine-structure constant, E_kin is the kinetic energy of the alpha particle, and θ is the scattering angle.

But maybe I should think in terms of the impact parameter and the relation to the scattering angle. The impact parameter b is related to the scattering angle θ by the formula b = ( (2 * Z * e^2) / (4 * π * ε₀ * mv²) ) * cot(θ/2) ), where Z is the atomic number of the target nucleus (gold has Z=79), e is the elementary charge, m is the mass of the alpha particle, and v is its velocity.

Wait, but since the energy is given as 7.7 MeV, maybe it's easier to work with kinetic energy. The kinetic energy K is related to v via K = ½ m v². So v = sqrt(2K/m). The mass of an alpha particle is about 4 times the mass of a proton. The proton mass is about 1.67e-27 kg, so m is approximately 6.68e-27 kg.

The scattering angle here is 90 degrees or more, so θ is ≥90°. But wait, the problem says "deflected at an angle of 90° or more," which I think refers to scattering angles greater than or equal to 90 degrees. So in terms of the cross-section, I'm looking for all scattering angles where θ ≥90°, which corresponds to a certain range of impact parameters.

The fraction of particles deflected would be the total cross-section for θ ≥90° divided by the total cross-section for all possible angles, but wait, no, actually, the fraction is the number of particles scattered into that angle range. Which would be the integral of the differential cross-section over the solid angles corresponding to θ ≥90°, divided by the total number of incident particles.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the total cross-section for scattering into angles ≥90°. The differential cross-section is (dσ/dΩ) = ( (Z α)^2 / (4 E_kin²) ) * (1 / sin^4(θ/2) ), where α is the fine structure constant (~1/137), Z is the atomic number of gold (79), and E_kin is the kinetic energy in appropriate units.

Wait, but E_kin is given in MeV, and we might need to convert that to joules for calculations. Oh wait, but in the formula, the units should be consistent. Let me think about the correct form.

Alternatively, I remember the formula for the total number of scattered particles (N) is given by N = N0 * n * x * σ, where N0 is the number of incident particles, n is the number of target atoms per unit area (but wait, no, the target is a foil, so perhaps it's n = n0 * x, where n0 is the number per unit volume and x is the thickness). Wait, maybe the formula is N = N0 * (n_target * σ_total), where σ_total is the cross-section. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the general approach is to compute the cross-sectional area σ that causes a scattering angle θ ≥90°, then the fraction of particles scattered is approximately σ / (total geometric cross-section) or perhaps just σ multiplied by something else. Wait, I think the fraction is (n * σ * x) where n is the number of target atoms per unit volume, x is the foil thickness, and σ is the cross-section for θ ≥90°. But I'm not entirely sure.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Find the cross-section σ(θ ≥90°) for a single gold nucleus.
2. Multiply σ by the number of target nuclei encountered by each alpha particle as it traverses the foil.
3. The product gives the probability that a single alpha particle is scattered by θ ≥90°, so the fraction is this probability.

So first, calculate the cross-section σ for θ ≥90°.

The formula for the differential cross-section is:

dσ/dΩ = ( (Z α)^2 ) / (4 E_kin^2 ) * 1 / sin^4(θ/2)

But to get the total cross-section for θ ≥90°, we need to integrate dσ/dΩ over the solid angle where θ ≥90°, which is a hemispherical solid angle (but wait, no, θ=90° is a plane, so the solid angle for θ ≥90° is 2π steradians. Because the solid angle for θ from 90° to 180° is 2π. Because the total solid angle around a point is 4π. The hemisphere (θ ≤90°) is 2π, so the other hemisphere (θ ≥90°) is also 2π steradians.)

Wait, the solid angle for θ from θ_min to θ_max is 2π(1 - cosθ_min). So for θ ≥90°, θ_min is 90°, so the solid angle Ω is 2π(1 - cos90°) = 2π(1 - 0) = 2π steradians.

So the total cross-section σ = ∫ (dσ/dΩ) dΩ for Ω=2π.

But wait, the integral of dσ/dΩ over dΩ is:

σ = ∫ (dσ/dΩ) dΩ = ∫ [ (Z α)^2 / (4 E_kin^2) * 1/sin^4(θ/2) ] * (something) dΩ

Wait, perhaps I should express dΩ in terms of θ and φ. dΩ = sinθ dθ dφ. For the range θ from 90° to 180°, and φ from 0 to 2π.

So,

σ = ∫ (from φ=0 to 2π) ∫ (θ=90° to 180°) [ (Z α)^2 / (4 E_kin^2) * 1/sin^4(θ/2) ) ] * sinθ dθ dφ

Let me compute this integral.

First, the (Z α)^2 / (4 E_kin^2 ) factor is a constant with respect to θ and φ, so it can be taken out.

So,

σ = (Z α)^2 / (4 E_kin^2 ) * ∫0^{2π} dφ ∫_{90°}^{180°} [1/sin^4(θ/2)] sinθ dθ

Compute the φ integral: ∫0^{2π} dφ = 2π.

Now compute the θ integral: ∫ [1/sin^4(θ/2)] sinθ dθ from θ=90° to 180°.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = θ/2, so θ=2u, dθ=2 du. When θ=90°, u=45°, θ=180°, u=90°.

So the integral becomes:

∫ (from u=45° to 90°) [1/sin^4(u)] * sin(2u) * 2 du

Because sinθ = sin(2u) = 2 sinu cosu.

So,

= 2 ∫ [1/sin^4 u] * (2 sinu cosu) du
= 4 ∫ [ cosu / sin^3 u ] du

Let’s make substitution v = sinu → dv = cosu du.

So the integral becomes:

4 ∫ v^{-3} dv = 4 [ v^{-2} / (-2) ) ] + C
= -2 v^{-2} + C
= -2 / v^2 + C

Evaluate from u=45° to u=90°.

At u=90°, v=sinu=1. So lower limit is u=45°, v=√2/2.

So,

= [ -2/(1^2) ) ] - [ -2/( (√2/2)^2 ) ]
= (-2) - [ -2/( (2/4) ) ]
= (-2) - [ -2/(1/2) ) ]
= (-2) - [ -4 ]
= (-2) +4 = 2.

So the θ integral evaluates to 2.

Putting it all together:

σ = (Z α)^2/(4 E_kin^2) * 2π * 4 ∫ ... which came out to 2.

Wait wait, let me recheck the steps. Wait, the integral after substitution gave us 2, and before that, the factors were 2π (from φ) and the integral gave 2.

Wait, let me retrace:

We had:

σ = (Z α)^2/(4 E_kin^2) * [2π] * [integral result]

Integral result was 2. So,

σ = (Z α)^2/(4 E_kin^2) * 2π * 2

= (Z α)^2/(4 E_kin^2) * 4 π

= (Z α)^2 * π / (E_kin^2 )

So σ = π Z² α² / E_kin².

Wait, that seems manageable. Now, Z is the atomic number of gold, which is 79.

E_kin is 7.7 MeV. But wait, in the formula, E_kin should be in joules. So I need to convert 7.7 MeV to joules.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules, so 1 MeV is 1.602e-13 J.

So E_kin = 7.7e6 eV = 7.7e6 * 1.602e-19 J = approximately 1.234e-12 J.

Wait, let me compute that accurately:

7.7 * 1.602e-13 = ?

7 * 1.602e-13 = 1.1214e-12

0.7 * 1.602e-13 = 1.1214e-13

So total is 1.1214e-12 + 1.1214e-13 = 1.3338e-12 J.

Wait, wait: 7.7 MeV = 7.7e6 eV, each eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 7.7e6 * 1.602e-19 = 7.7 * 1.602e-13 = Let's compute 7 * 1.602 = 11.214, 0.7 *1.602=1.1214, so total 12.3354e-13 = 1.23354e-12 J.

So E_kin is approximately 1.2335e-12 J.

Now, the fine structure constant α is approximately 1/137. So α ≈ 0.007297.

So putting in the numbers:

σ = π * (79)^2 * (α)^2 / (E_kin)^2.

Compute each part step by step.

Compute Z²: 79^2 = 6241.

Compute α²: (0.007297)^2 ≈ 5.32e-5.

E_kin squared: (1.2335e-12)^2 = approx (1.2335)^2 * 1e-24 = 1.523 * 1e-24 = 1.523e-24 J².

So σ = π * 6241 * 5.32e-5 / (1.523e-24 )

Compute numerator: 6241 * 5.32e-5 = let's calculate 6241 * 5.32e-5.

6241 * 5.32e-5 = (6000 *5.32e-5) + (241 *5.32e-5).

6000 *5.32e-5 = 6000 * 0.0000532 = 0.3192.

241 *5.32e-5 = 241 *0.0000532 ≈ 241 * 5.32e-5 = let's compute 240 *5.32e-5 = 0.012768, plus 1 *5.32e-5=0.0000532 → total ≈0.0128212.

So total numerator part: 0.3192 + 0.0128212 ≈ 0.332.

Then multiply by π: 0.332 * π ≈ 1.0428.

So numerator is approx 1.0428.

Denominator is 1.523e-24.

So σ = 1.0428 / (1.523e-24 ) ≈ 6.84e24 m².

Wait, that seems extremely large. That doesn't make sense. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the units in the formula. Let me double-check the cross-section formula. The Rutherford cross-section is given in terms of [ (Z α)^2 ] / (4 E_kin^2 ), but perhaps I'm missing a factor involving some constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is written as:

dσ/dΩ = ( (Z α)^2 )/( (4 E_kin)^2 ) * 1/sin^4(θ/2 )

But wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

dσ/dΩ = ( (Z e² )² ) / ( (4 * π * ε0 * (m v² / 2) )² ) * (1 / (16 sin^4(θ/2)) )

Hmm, maybe I should approach this using the relation between impact parameter and scattering angle.

The impact parameter b is related to the scattering angle θ by:

b = ( (Z e² ) / (4 * π * ε0 * m v²) ) * cot(θ/2 )

Where m is the mass of the alpha particle, v is its velocity.

So the maximum impact parameter that leads to θ ≥90° would be when θ=90°, so cot(θ/2) = cot(45°)=1.

So b_max = (Z e² ) / (4 π ε0 m v² )

Each nucleus presents a cross-section area σ = π b_max^2, which is the area that would cause a scattering angle of θ=90°. So the cross-section for θ ≥90° is σ = π b_max^2.

Wait, but that might be the cross-section for scattering at exactly θ=90°, but perhaps for θ ≥90°, it's the same as the area where impact parameter is less than or equal to b_max, because smaller impact parameters lead to larger scattering angles.

So the cross-section for θ ≥90° is the area of a circle with radius b_max, so σ = π b_max².

Hmm, that approach might be simpler.

So let's compute b_max.

We have:

b_max = (Z e²) / (4 π ε0 m v² )

But m v² is equal to 2 K, where K is the kinetic energy. So m v^2 = 2 K.

So substituting:

b_max = (Z e²) / (4 π ε0 * 2 K )

= (Z e²) / (8 π ε0 K )

Now, compute b_max.

Given:

Z = 79 (gold),

e = 1.602e-19 C,

ε0 = 8.854e-12 F/m,

K = 7.7 MeV = 7.7e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.233e-12 J.

So,

b_max = (79 * (1.602e-19 C)^2 ) / (8 * π * 8.854e-12 F/m * 1.233e-12 J )

Compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 79 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = approx 2.566e-38 C².

Multiply by 79: 79 * 2.566e-38 ≈ 2.017e-36 C².

Denominator: 8 * π * 8.854e-12 * 1.233e-12.

Compute 8 * π ≈ 25.1327.

25.1327 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 25.1327 * 8.854e-12 ≈ 2.228e-10.

Multiply by 1.233e-12: 2.228e-10 * 1.233e-12 ≈ 2.752e-22.

So denominator is 2.752e-22.

So b_max = numerator / denominator = (2.017e-36) / (2.752e-22) = approx 7.33e-15 meters.

Wait, 2.017e-36 / 2.752e-22 = (2.017 / 2.752) * 1e-14 = approx 0.733 * 1e-14 = 7.33e-15 m.

So b_max ≈ 7.33e-15 m.

Then, the cross-section σ is π b_max².

Compute b_max squared: (7.33e-15)^2 ≈ 5.38e-29 m².

Multiply by π: 5.38e-29 * 3.1416 ≈ 1.69e-28 m².

So σ ≈ 1.69e-28 m² per nucleus.

Now, the number of target nuclei encountered by each alpha particle as it traverses the foil is given by n = n0 * x, where n0 is the number of nuclei per unit volume, and x is the thickness of the foil.

n0 is the number of gold nuclei per cubic meter
