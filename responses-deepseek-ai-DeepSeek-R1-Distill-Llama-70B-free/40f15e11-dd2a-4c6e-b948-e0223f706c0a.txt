Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Law enforcement authorities had probable cause to suspect a man of murder. Without an arrest warrant, they went to his home to arrest him. They knocked and announced, and hearing no response, forcibly broke open the door and entered the house. They didn't find anyone but seized a handgun that was in plain view. The suspect was later arrested for murder; he filed for suppression of the gun. Will the suppression court throw out the gun?

Options:

A: Yes, the entry was a violation of the knock and announce rule.
B: No, the entry did not require an arrest warrant because the authorities already had established probable cause.
C: Yes, the police must obtain an arrest warrant to enter someone's home for an arrest.
D: No, the police did not need a warrant because the gun was in plain view.
E: Yes, the police needed both a search warrant for the gun and an arrest warrant for the suspect.
F: No, because the suspect was not home at the time of entry, no warrant was needed.
G: Yes, the police violated the suspect's right to privacy by forcibly entering his home.
H: Yes, the police needed a search warrant in addition to an arrest warrant to seize the gun.
I: No, the entry was authorized by exigent circumstances and the gun was in plain view.
J: No, the police were in the right because they announced their presence before entering.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about police procedure and the Fourth Amendment. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that law enforcement has probable cause to suspect a man of murder. They go to his home to arrest him without an arrest warrant. They knock and announce, but when no one responds, they force their way in. They don't find anyone there, but they seize a handgun that's in plain view. Later, the suspect is arrested and files to suppress the gun as evidence. The question is whether the court will throw out the gun.

Hmm. I remember that the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. So, the key issues here are whether the police had the authority to enter the home without an arrest warrant and whether seizing the gun was legal.

First, the arrest. Normally, to make a felony arrest in a home, the police need an arrest warrant, right? Or do they? I think under some circumstances, like exigent circumstances, they might not need one. But the question says they had probable cause, not necessarily exigent circumstances. Wait, but they knocked and announced, heard nothing, then broke in. So, was this a valid entry?

Wait, there's a case called Payton v. New York, which says that police can't enter a home to arrest without an arrest warrant, unless there are exigent circumstances. So if they had probable cause but no warrant, and no exigent circumstances, then the entry would be illegal.

But wait, did they have exigent circumstances here? The question doesn't say. They just went to arrest him, knocked, no answer, so they broke in. Is the lack of an answer enough for exigent circumstances? I'm not sure. Exigent circumstances might include things like the suspect might flee, evidence might be destroyed, or there's an emergency. If the police had probable cause and perhaps reason to believe the suspect was inside, maybe the fact that he didn't answer could create a fear that he's fleeing or hiding, which could be exigent. But I'm not entirely certain.

Assuming there were no exigent circumstances, then entering without an arrest warrant would be a Payton violation. So the entry was illegal, making any evidence found (the gun) subject to suppression.

Wait, but what about the seizure of the gun? It was in plain view. The plain view doctrine allows police to seize evidence without a warrant if they are lawfully present, the object is in plain view, and it's apparent that the object is contraband or evidence of a crime.

So in this case, if the police's entry was unlawful, then they weren't lawfully present. Therefore, they couldn't use the plain view exception to seize the gun. So the gun would be suppressed.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes, because the knock and announce was violated. Wait, the knock and announce rule is about how the police enter, but the question is more about the warrant. So maybe that's not the main issue here.

Option B says no, because authorities had probable cause. But having probable cause isn't enough without a warrant when entering a home. So B is incorrect.

Option C says yes, because they needed an arrest warrant. That's what Payton says, so if they didn't have one and no exigent circumstances, then C could be correct.

Option D says no, because the gun was in plain view. But if the entry was illegal, then plain view doesn't apply. So D is wrong.

Option E says yes, they needed both. Wait, they needed an arrest warrant to enter the home. Once inside, if they were lawfully present, they could seize the gun without a separate search warrant. So E is incorrect because they only needed the arrest warrant, not a separate search warrant for the seizure.

Option F says no because the suspect wasn't home. But the issue is the entry into the home, regardless of whether he was there. So F is incorrect.

Option G says yes, because they violated privacy by entering. That's a general statement, but the legal issue is about the warrant requirement. So G is more about the outcome than the reason.

Option H says yes, they needed a search warrant in addition to an arrest warrant. No, the plain view doesn't require a separate search warrant. So H is incorrect.

Option I says no, because of exigent circumstances. If there were such, then the answer would be no. But the question doesn't mention any, so I don't think I can assume that. So I is incorrect unless exigent circumstances apply.

Option J says no because they announced. Knock and announce is a different rule. They did knock and announce, so that part was correct. But the main issue is the warrant, not the knock and announce. So J is wrong.

Putting it all together, if the police entered without an arrest warrant and without exigent circumstances, the entry was illegal. Therefore, the gun, seized under plain view, would be inadmissible because the officers weren't lawfully present. So the suppression court would throw out the gun.

Looking back at the options, option C says yes, because police must obtain an arrest warrant to enter someone's home. That seems correct. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about option I. If the police had probable cause and maybe the situation provided exigent circumstances, then maybe the entry was okay. But the question doesn't state any such circumstances. So without more, I think the entry was illegal, and the suppression should be granted.

The Fourth Amendment requires that police obtain an arrest warrant to enter a home unless exigent circumstances exist. In this case, the police had probable cause but no arrest warrant. They knocked and announced, heard no response, and forcibly entered the home. The question does not mention exigent circumstances, so the entry likely violated Payton v. New York, which prohibits home entry without an arrest warrant absent such circumstances. 

The plain view doctrine allows seizure of evidence without a warrant if the police are lawfully present. However, since the entry was unlawful, the plain view doctrine does not apply, and the gun would be suppressed. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The issue is not the knock-and-announce rule but the lack of an arrest warrant.  
- **B**: Incorrect. Probable cause alone does not justify entry into a home without a warrant.  
- **C**: Correct. The police needed an arrest warrant to enter the home, as no exigent circumstances were present.  
- **D**: Incorrect. The plain view doctrine does not apply if the entry is unlawful.  
- **E**: Incorrect. The police only needed an arrest warrant, not a separate search warrant.  
- **F**: Incorrect. The absence of the suspect does not negate the need for a warrant.  
- **G**: Incorrect. The violation is about the warrant requirement, not just privacy.  
- **H**: Incorrect. No separate search warrant was needed for the seizure.  
- **I**: Incorrect. Exigent circumstances were not mentioned, so this does not apply.  
- **J**: Incorrect. Knocking and announcing does not justify entry without a warrant.  

Thus, the suppression court will likely throw out the gun because the police needed an arrest warrant to enter the home.
