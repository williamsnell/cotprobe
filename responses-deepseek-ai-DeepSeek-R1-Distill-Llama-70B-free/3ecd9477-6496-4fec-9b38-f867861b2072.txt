Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about an ideal gas that's pure. It says the gas not only has a pressure of 1 atm but also a concentration of 1 mole per liter. I'm supposed to find under what conditions this happens, and the options are A to J, with various temperatures.

Hmm. I remember that concentration, which is moles per liter, is related to the ideal gas law. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. So maybe I need to use that. Let me think.

Wait, concentration is n/V, so that's moles per liter. So if I rearrange the ideal gas law, I can express concentration (let's call it C) as C = P/(RT). Because PV = nRT → n/V = P/(RT).

So the concentration C is equal to pressure divided by R times temperature. Here, the pressure is 1 atm, and the concentration is 1 mole/liter. So I can plug those into the equation.

C = P/(RT) → 1 mol/L = (1 atm) / (R * T). I need to solve for T.

Wait, what's R in this context? The gas constant. But I need to make sure the units are compatible. Let's think about the units. R is commonly 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So using that, the equation becomes:

1 = (1) / (0.0821 * T). Solving for T would give me T = 1 / 0.0821. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 1 divided by 0.0821 is approximately 12.18 K. Wait, that's around 12.18 K. Let me check the options. Option B is 12.19K, which is very close. So that must be the answer, right?

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. I used C = P/(RT). Yes, because n/V is concentration. So with P=1 atm, C=1, R=0.0821.

So solving for T: T = (1 atm) / (C * R) → T = 1/(1 * 0.0821) ≈ 12.18 K. So the closest option is B:12.19K. So the correct answer is B.

Wait a second, could I have made a mistake with units? Let's confirm R. Yes, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), which matches the units needed here—because pressure is in atm, and concentration is in mol/L, so R's units make sense.

So yeah, the calculation seems correct. So the temperature is about 12.19 K. So option B is the correct choice.

To determine the conditions under which a pure sample of an ideal gas exhibits both a pressure of 1 atm and a concentration of 1 mole liter\(^{-1}\), we use the relationship between concentration (\(C\)), pressure (\(P\)), and temperature (\(T\)) derived from the ideal gas law:

\[
C = \frac{P}{RT}
\]

Here:
- \(C = 1 \, \text{mol/L}\) (concentration),
- \(P = 1 \, \text{atm}\) (pressure),
- \(R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\) (ideal gas constant).

Rearranging the equation to solve for \(T\):

\[
T = \frac{P}{C \cdot R}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
T = \frac{1}{1 \cdot 0.0821} \approx 12.18 \, \text{K}
\]

Among the given options, the closest value to \(12.18 \, \text{K}\) is \(12.19 \, \text{K}\), which corresponds to option **B**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: 12.19K**

Answer: B
