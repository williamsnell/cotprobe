Question:

A woman was hit in the right eye by a shard of glass when her car was rear-ended by an industrial truck. She was hospitalized, lost her eye, and had several operations over several years. She could not return to work as an apprentice ballet dancer due to loss of coordination, constant headaches, and severe disfigurement. She is considered totally disabled. She had been training for the ballet for many years and, at the trial against the tortfeasor, she proved that she was considered a bright and uncoming student. The defendant claimed that this was still too speculative whether she would have been successful. The trial court disagreed and allowed evidence on the lost earning capacity of a ballet dancer. The jury awarded $3 million. Will the appellate court likely reverse the verdict due to the lost earning capacity issue?

Options:

A: Yes, because the damages awarded are excessive and not substantiated by concrete proof of earning capacity.
B: Yes, because the plaintiff failed to prove that she would have definitely become a successful professional ballet dancer.
C: Yes, because the defendant has the right to challenge the amount of the award given by the jury.
D: Yes, the evidence did not guarantee or assure anyone that she really would have been a successful professional ballet dancer.
E: No, the jury's award is discretionary and inviolate, and it may not be disturbed with respect to personal injury damages.
F: Yes, she can only collect for lost work that she held prior to the accident; her future lost earning capacity could be based on an apprentice ballet dancer.
G: No, because some imprecision in the evidence regarding loss of earning capacity is to be expected and is not grounds for excluding the evidence.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically dealing with damages for loss of earning capacity. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The scenario is about a woman who was in a car accident, lost her eye, and had several operations. Because of her injuries, she couldn't return to her job as an apprentice ballet dancer. She's considered totally disabled, and she's suing the tortfeasor. At trial, she presented evidence about her lost earning capacity as a ballet dancer, and the jury awarded her $3 million. The defendant is appealing, arguing that it's too speculative whether she would have been successful as a ballet dancer.

The question is whether the appellate court will reverse the verdict because of the lost earning capacity issue.

Hmm. So, I remember that in tort law, when calculating damages for personal injuries, plaintiffs can recover for lost earning capacity. This isn't just about the earnings they've already lost but also the potential future earnings they can no longer pursue because of the injury.

But the key here is how speculative that future earning capacity is. Courts generally require that the plaintiff show that their future earnings were reasonably certain, not just speculative. So, for example, if someone is a young professional with a clear trajectory, like a medical student about to graduate, it's easier to show future earnings. But a ballet dancer might be a different case because it's a highly competitive field, and success isn't guaranteed.

In this case, the woman was an apprentice. She had been training for many years and was considered a bright and upcoming student. So she had some credible evidence that she was on a path towards becoming a professional ballet dancer. The trial court allowed evidence on this, but the defendant argues it's too speculative.

I think the general rule is that while the plaintiff doesn't have to prove with certainty that they would have succeeded, they do need to provide enough evidence to allow the jury to make an informed estimate. If the evidence is too vague or speculative, the court might exclude it. But if there's a basis for the claim, even if it's not 100% certain, the court will let it go to the jury.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Yes, because the damages are excessive and not substantiated. I'm not sure if the appellate court would say the damages are excessive just because the evidence is a bit speculative. Courts usually defer to the jury on the amount unless it's clearly against the evidence.

Option B: Yes, because she didn't prove she'd definitely become successful. The law doesn't require definite success, just reasonable certainty. So this might not be the right reason.

Option C: Yes, because the defendant can challenge the amount. But generally, the appellate court won't overturn a jury's damage award unless it's unsupported by the evidence. So this option is probably incorrect.

Option D: Yes, the evidence didn't guarantee success. Again, the law doesn't require a guarantee, so this might not be the right reason for reversal.

Option E: No, the jury's award is discretionary. This is incorrect because appellate courts can review if the award is supported by sufficient evidence. They don't just rubber-stamp jury decisions.

Option F: She can only collect for past work, not future as an apprentice. Wait, but she was already working as an apprentice, so her future earnings as a ballet dancer could be based on that. I don't think this is correct because future earnings can be considered if there's a basis.

Option G: No, because some imprecision is expected. This makes sense. Courts allow for some uncertainty because future earnings are always speculative to some degree. As long as there's a reasonable basis, the evidence is admissible, and the jury can consider it.

So putting it all together, the appellate court is unlikely to reverse the verdict because the trial court properly allowed the evidence, recognizing that some imprecision is acceptable. The plaintiff provided enough evidence of her potential earning capacity as a ballet dancer, so the jury's award should stand.

The appellate court is unlikely to reverse the verdict because the trial court properly allowed evidence on the plaintiff's lost earning capacity. While the success of a ballet dancer is inherently competitive and uncertain, the plaintiff provided sufficient evidence of her trajectory as a bright and upcoming student, which gave the jury a reasonable basis to estimate future earnings. Courts generally accept some degree of imprecision in such cases, as future earnings are inherently speculative. Therefore, the jury's award was supported by adequate evidence, and the appellate court will not disturb it on the grounds of speculation.
