B: 23.25
C: 25.25
D: 23.75

J: 22.75

Answer:
    <think>


To solve the equation \( \frac{13}{4} = \frac{x}{7} \), we can use cross-multiplication to find the value of \( x \).

Starting with the equation:
\[
\frac{13}{4} = \frac{x}{7}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
13 \times 7 = 4 \times x
\]

Simplifying:
\[
91 = 4x
\]

To isolate \( x \), divide both sides by 4:
\[
x = \frac{91}{4} = 22.75
\]

Looking at the options provided, the correct answer is **J: 22.75**.

Answer: J
