Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two thin convex lenses and their focal lengths. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on optics, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The question says: Two thin convex lenses with focal lengths f1 and f2 are separated by a distance equal to 2f2. And we're given that f1 is equal to 3 times f2. The task is to find the focal length of the combination of these two lenses. The options are from A to J, but I'll focus on solving it first.

Wait, I remember that when you have two lenses in a system, the combined focal length isn't just a simple average or sum. There must be a specific formula for it. Oh right! For two lenses separated by some distance d, the combined focal length (let's call it F) is given by 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2, but wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, wait. Isn't that the formula for when the lenses are in contact, meaning they're right next to each other with zero separation? Because when they're separated, the formula changes.

Right, I think the correct formula when two lenses are separated by a distance d is 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + (d)/(f1*f2). Wait, no, that doesn't ring a bell. Maybe I'm mixing it up with something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait a second, I think the combined focal length when two lenses are in contact (d=0) is 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2. But when they are separated by a distance d, the formula becomes 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - (d)/(f1 f2). Or maybe it's plus d/(f1 f2). I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should think differently.

Let me recall: The standard formula when the two lenses are in contact is indeed 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2. But when they are separated, the effective focal length changes based on the separation. Alternatively, perhaps I should model each lens as a thin lens and consider the system as a combination.

Wait, another approach: The system of two lenses can be treated as a single lens. So, perhaps I can use the lens formula for each lens and see how the images form.

Let me think of it as an optical system. The first lens will take an object and form an image, which then serves as the object for the second lens. The separation between the lenses is d. So the distance between the first lens and the second lens is d, which is given as 2f2.

Let me denote the first lens (with f1) as Lens 1 and the second (f2) as Lens 2. The separation d is between the two lenses, so after Lens 1, the object for Lens 2 is at a distance determined by where Lens 1 forms the image.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model this using the concept of equivalent focal length when two lenses are separated.

I think the formula for the equivalent focal length F when two lenses are separated by a distance d is:

1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + d/(f1 f2)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I might have it wrong. Maybe I should look for the correct formula.

Wait, another approach: The formula for the combination of two thin lenses separated by a distance d is given by:

1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - (d)/(f1 f2)

Wait, I'm getting conflicting possibilities. Maybe I should derive it.

Let me consider the system. Let’s say the first lens forms an image at some point, and then the second lens acts on that image.

Suppose an object is placed at infinity. The first lens (f1) will form an image at its focal point, so the image distance from the first lens is f1. That image then serves as the object for the second lens. The distance between the two lenses is d, which is 2f2. So the object distance for the second lens would be d, but wait, the image from the first lens is at f1 beyond the first lens, so the object distance for the second lens is d - f1? Wait, no, because the image is formed on the other side of the first lens.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the object at infinity, so the first lens creates an image at its focal point (distance f1 from itself). The second lens is a distance d away from the first. So the object for the second lens is at a distance of (d - f1) from itself. Wait, but if the object is at f1 behind the first lens, and the second lens is d in front of the first, then the object distance for the second lens is d - f1, but wait, no, because the image is on the opposite side. Let me visualize this.

Let’s say the two lenses are arranged along a line. The object is at infinity, so the first lens forms a real image at f1 behind itself (assuming the object is on the other side). Now, the second lens is placed a distance d from the first lens. So the distance between the image from the first lens and the second lens is d - f1. Wait, no. Wait, the first lens is placed at position 0. It forms an image at position f1 (on the other side, so position +f1). The second lens is at position d (since the separation is d). So the distance between the image of the first lens (at +f1) and the second lens (at +d) is (d - f1). So the object distance for the second lens is (d - f1), but since the object is on the same side as the incoming light, which is the same side as the image of the first lens, wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the object for the second lens is at u = d - f1. But since the image formed by the first lens is real, it's on the opposite side, so the second lens sees this image as an object at a distance of (d - f1) from itself.

Wait, but the formula for the image formed by the second lens would be 1/f2 = 1/v - 1/u, where u is the object distance for the second lens. So if u is (d - f1), then 1/f2 = 1/v - 1/(d - f1). Solving for v gives 1/v = 1/f2 + 1/(d - f1).

But wait, the overall focal length of the system would relate to the image formed by the second lens when the object is at infinity. So the combined system's focal length F would be such that the image is formed at F from the second lens. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Another approach: The combined focal length F of two lenses separated by d is given by the formula:

1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + (d)/(f1 f2)

Wait, I think I've heard that formula before, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - (d)/(f1 f2). Let me think: when d=0, the formula should reduce to 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2, which is correct for lenses in contact. So maybe the correct formula is 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - (d)/(f1 f2) * (some factor). Hmm, perhaps I should look up the exact formula, but since I can't, I'll proceed carefully.

Wait, perhaps another way: When two lenses are in contact, their combined focal length is 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2. But when they are separated by a distance d, the formula becomes 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - (d)/(f1 f2). So when d increases, 1/F decreases, implying that F increases. That makes sense because separating the lenses would make the system less powerful.

So let's plug in the values given. We have f1 = 3f2, and d = 2f2.

So substituting into 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - (d)/(f1 f2):

1/F = (1/(3f2)) + (1/f2) - (2f2)/( (3f2)*f2 )

Simplify each term:

1/(3f2) + 1/f2 = (1 + 3)/(3f2) = 4/(3f2)

Then the third term: (2f2)/(3f2 * f2) )= 2/(3f2)

So putting it together:

1/F = [4/(3f2)] - [2/(3f2)] = (4-2)/(3f2) = 2/(3f2)

Thus, F = (3f2)/2. So the combined focal length is (3f2)/2, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula because I'm not 100% confident. Suppose I got the sign wrong in the formula. Let me think again. If the formula is 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + (d)/(f1 f2), then plugging in the numbers would give a different result.

Wait, using the alternative formula: 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + d/(f1 f2), then:

1/F = (1/(3f2)) + (1/f2) + (2f2)/(3f2 * f2 )

= 1/(3f2) + 1/f2 + (2f2)/(3f2^2)

= (1 + 3)/(3f2) + 2/(3f2)

= 4/(3f2) + 2/(3f2) = 6/(3f2) = 2/f2 → F = f2/2.

But that's not one of the options, except maybe option I, which is f2/3. No, that's not matching. So perhaps the correct formula is the first one, with a minus sign.

Wait, maybe I should think of the formula as 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - (d)/(f1 f2). So with the given values:

1/F = (1/(3f2)) + (1/f2) - (2f2)/(3f2 * f2 )

= (1/(3f2) + 3/(3f2)) ) - (2/(3f2))

= (4/(3f2)) - (2/(3f2)) = 2/(3f2)

So F = 3f2/2, which is option A.

But wait, let me think about the physical meaning. If the lenses are placed far apart, the focal length should approach the individual focal lengths, but in this case, they are placed at 2f2, which is a significant distance. So the combined focal length being longer than f2 suggests that the combination is less powerful, which makes sense when the lenses are separated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the system using the thin lens formula for each lens and track the image formation step by step.

Assume an object is placed at infinity. The first lens, with f1 = 3f2, will form an image at its focal point, which is 3f2 from itself. Now, the second lens is placed at a distance of 2f2 from the first lens. So the distance between the first lens and the second is 2f2.

The image formed by the first lens is at 3f2 from it, on the opposite side of the object. The second lens is 2f2 away from the first, so the distance between the image (from the first lens) and the second lens is (3f2 - 2f2) = f2. Wait, that's interesting. So the image from the first lens is at f2 distance in front of the second lens.

Wait, no. Let me recheck: The first lens is at position 0, the image it forms is at +3f2 (on the right side). The second lens is at position +2f2. So the distance between the image of the first lens (at +3f2) and the second lens (at +2f2) is (3f2 - 2f2) = f2. So the object for the second lens is at u = f2 in front of it.

Wait, no: The image formed by the first lens is on the opposite side, so the second lens is placed at +2f2 from the first. So the image from the first is at +3f2. The distance between the image and the second lens is 3f2 - 2f2 = f2. So for the second lens, the object distance is u = f2.

Wait, but then the second lens would form an image at v, where 1/f2 = 1/v + 1/u. So 1/f2 = 1/v + 1/f2 → 1/v = 0 → v approaches infinity.

Wait, that can't be right. If the object is at f2 in front of the second lens, then using the lens formula, 1/f2 = 1/v + 1/f2 → 1/v = 0 → v is infinity. So the image formed by the second lens is at infinity, which would imply that the combined system's focal length is such that when the object is at infinity, the image is at the focal point of the combination.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, when the object is at infinity, the first lens forms an image at f1, which is 3f2. The second lens is placed at a distance d=2f2 from the first, so the image from the first lens is at f1 - d = 3f2 - 2f2 = f2 in front of the second lens. So for the second lens, the object distance is u = f2.

So applying the lens formula for the second lens:

1/f2 = 1/v + 1/u → 1/f2 = 1/v + 1/f2.

Subtracting 1/f2 from both sides gives 0 = 1/v → v approaches infinity. That's confusing. It suggests that the image is formed at infinity, which would imply that the combined system's focal length is such that when the object is at infinity, the image is at F, but according to this, the image is at infinity. That doesn't help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the combined focal length differently.

Wait, perhaps I should model the system using the concept of equivalent focal length. The formula for two lenses separated by distance d is:

1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + (d)/(f1 f2)

But when I plug in the numbers, I get 1/F = (1/3f2 + 1/f2) + (2f2)/(3f2^2) → 4/(3f2) + 2/(3f2) → 6/(3f2) = 2/f2 → F = f2/2. But this doesn't match any of the options except maybe not. Wait, looking back at the options, option A is (3f2)/2, which is different.

Wait, but earlier I thought the correct formula had a minus sign. Let me try that again. If the formula is 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - (d)/(f1 f2), then:

1/F = (1/(3f2)) + (1/f2) - (2f2)/(3f2 * f2 )

= (1 + 3)/(3f2) ) - (2)/(3f2)

= (4)/(3f2) - 2/(3f2) = 2/(3f2) → F = (3f2)/2.

Which is option A. So that would be the answer.

But wait, earlier when I tried considering the image formed, I ended up with the image at infinity, which would imply that F is infinite, but that contradicts this. So perhaps my approach there was wrong. Maybe I should think of it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the focal length of two lenses separated by d:

F = (f1 f2 (f1 + f2 + d)) / (f1 f2 + f2 d + f1 d + d^2)

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as the first lens creating an image, which then becomes the object for the second lens. But perhaps I should consider the system as forming a virtual image when the object is at a certain point.

Wait, maybe using the concept of the combined focal length when two lenses are separated by d is:

1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2 + (d)/(f1 f2)

So substituting f1=3f2, d=2f2:

1/F = 1/(3f2) + 1/f2 + (2f2)/(3f2 * f2 )

= (1/(3f2) + 3/(3f2)) + (2)/(3f2)

= (4/(3f2)) + (2/(3f2)) = 6/(3f2) = 2/f2 → F = f2/2.

But none of the options match this. Wait, looking at the options, option I is f2/3, and option C is 2f2/3. Hmm. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I have the formula wrong. Another approach is to use the formula for the equivalent focal length of two separated lenses:

F = (f1 f2 (f1 + f2 - d)) / (f1 f2 + f1 d + f2 d + d^2)

Wait, that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the image formed by the combination.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the system as a single lens and find its focal length. The first lens has f1, the second f2, separated by d=2f2.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is 1/F = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - (d)/(f1 f2). So again, substituting:

1/F = (1/(3f2)) + (1/f2) - (2f2)/(3f2 * f2 )

= [1/(3f2) + 3/(3f2)] - [2/(3f2)]

= (4/(3f2)) - (2/(3f2)) = 2/(3f2) → F = (
