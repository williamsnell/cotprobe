Okay, so I have this question about what happens to the length of an iron strip when its temperature increases. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, I remember that when materials are heated, they usually expand. That makes sense because the atoms vibrate more and spread out a bit. So for solids like iron, heating them should cause them to expand. That would mean the length increases. So the question is, which option says that?

Looking at the options: Option G says "also increases." Wait, what does "also" refer to? Oh, the question is about length, so if temperature increases, length increases. So G seems correct.

Wait, but let me go through the other options to be sure. Option A says it increases then decreases. No, I don't think that's right. Unless there's some phase change, but the question doesn't mention anything like melting. Iron has a high melting point, so unless it's heated to extreme temperatures, which the question doesn't specify, the length should just keep increasing with temperature. So A is probably not it.

Option B says it decreases in width as it gets longer. Wait, that's talking about width, not length. But the question is about the length of the strip. So B isn't the right choice here.

Option C says it increases exponentially. I don't think thermal expansion is exponential. It's usually linear or follows a proportional relationship, like the linear expansion formula where change in length is proportional to the original length and the temperature change. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D says it remains the same. No, that's not right because thermal expansion does occur. So D is wrong.

Option E says it may increase and may decrease. Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Under normal circumstances, heating causes expansion. So unless it's a special case, E doesn't apply here. So E is probably not the answer.

Option F talks about thickness decreasing. Again, the question is about length, not thickness, so F isn't relevant.

Option H says it becomes unpredictable. No, thermal expansion is a predictable phenomenon. So H is incorrect.

Option I says it oscillates. No, that's not something I've heard of in thermal expansion. So I is wrong.

Option J says it decreases. That's the opposite of what happens, so J is incorrect.

So the only option that makes sense is G, which says "also increases." Wait, but wait a second. The options are a bit confusing. Let me re-read the question. It says, when the temperature of a strip of iron increases, the length of the strip... So the correct answer should be that the length increases.

Wait, looking back, option G says "also increases." So "also" might be a bit confusing. Maybe the question is part of a series where previous options discussed other properties. But in this case, the question is standalone. So perhaps G is correct.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the answer is G because "also" refers to the length increasing when the temperature does. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again. Option G: "also increases." So if the temperature increases, the length also increases. That makes sense.

When the temperature of a strip of iron increases, the length of the strip increases due to thermal expansion. This phenomenon is well-understood and predictable, with the length increasing proportionally to the temperature change. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The length does not increase and then decrease; it consistently increases with temperature.
- **B**: Incorrect. The question focuses on length, not width.
- **C**: Incorrect. Thermal expansion is not exponential; it follows a linear relationship.
- **D**: Incorrect. The length does not remain the same; it increases.
- **E**: Incorrect. Under normal conditions, the length only increases with temperature.
- **F**: Incorrect. The question is about length, not thickness.
- **G**: Correct. The length increases as the temperature rises.
- **H**: Incorrect. Thermal expansion is predictable.
- **I**: Incorrect. The length does not oscillate.
- **J**: Incorrect. The length does not decrease.

The correct answer is **G**, as the length of the strip increases with temperature.

Answer: G
