Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to determine the values of a, b, and c such that the function x² + a y² + y + i(b x y + c x) is analytic as a function of the complex variable x + i y. Hmm, right, analytic functions are those that satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. 

Wait, I remember that for a function to be analytic, it needs to satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. So the function is given in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me think. If z = x + i y, then the function f(z) can be written as u(x,y) + i v(x,y), where u is the real part and v is the imaginary part. 

Looking at the given function: the real part is x² + a y² + y, and the imaginary part is b x y + c x. So u = x² + a y² + y and v = b x y + c x.

The Cauchy-Riemann equations state that the partial derivatives must satisfy ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y and ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x. 

Let me compute these partial derivatives step by step. 

First, ∂u/∂x. The derivative of x² with respect to x is 2x. The term a y² differentiates to 0 since it's with respect to x. The derivative of y with respect to x is 0. So ∂u/∂x = 2x.

Now, ∂v/∂y. The term b x y differentiates to b x. The term c x differentiates to 0. So ∂v/∂y = b x.

According to the Cauchy-Riemann equations, ∂u/∂x must equal ∂v/∂y. So 2x = b x. This equation needs to hold for all x, which implies that the coefficients of x must be equal. So 2 = b. Wait, so b must be 2.

Next, let's compute the other equations. Now, ∂u/∂y. The real part u is x² + a y² + y. The derivative of x² is 0, the derivative of a y² is 2a y, and the derivative of y is 1. So ∂u/∂y = 2a y + 1.

Now, ∂v/∂x. The imaginary part v is b x y + c x. The derivative of b x y with respect to x is b y. The derivative of c x is c. So ∂v/∂x = b y + c.

The Cauchy-Riemann equation says that ∂u/∂y must equal -∂v/∂x. So 2a y + 1 = -(b y + c). Let's rearrange this: 2a y + 1 = -b y - c.

Now, this must hold for all x and y, which means the coefficients of y and the constant terms must match on both sides. So let's equate the coefficients of y and the constants separately.

Coefficient of y: 2a = -b. But earlier we found that b=2. So substituting, 2a = -2 → a = -1.

Constant terms: The left side has +1, and the right side has -c. So 1 = -c → c = -1.

Wait, but let me double-check. So putting it all together:

From ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y → 2x = b x → b=2.

From ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x → 2a y +1 = -b y - c.

We have b=2, so:

2a y +1 = -2 y - c.

So, equate coefficients:

2a = -2 → a = -1.

And 1 = -c → c = -1.

So the values are a=-1, b=2, c=-1.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is [-1, 2, -1]. So that should be the correct answer.

Let me just check again. Let me substitute these values back into the original function and see if it's analytic.

So with a=-1, b=2, c=-1, the function becomes:

Real part u = x² - y² + y.

Imaginary part v = 2 x y - x.

Let me compute the Cauchy-Riemann conditions again.

Compute ∂u/∂x: 2x. ∂v/∂y: 2x. So 2x=2x, which holds.

Compute ∂u/∂y: -2y +1. ∂v/∂x: 2y -1.

Wait, so ∂u/∂y should be equal to -∂v/∂x. Let's see:

-∂v/∂x = -(2y -1) = -2y +1.

Which is exactly ∂u/∂y. So yes, it satisfies both conditions.

Therefore, the correct values are a=-1, b=2, c=-1, which is option B.

To determine the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that the function \(x^2 + ay^2 + y + i(bxy + cx)\) is analytic as a function of the complex variable \(x + iy\), we need to ensure that the function satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations. 

The function can be written as \(u(x, y) + iv(x, y)\), where:
- \(u(x, y) = x^2 + ay^2 + y\) (real part),
- \(v(x, y) = bxy + cx\) (imaginary part).

The Cauchy-Riemann equations are:
1. \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\),
2. \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\).

### Step 1: Compute \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\) and \(\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\)
- \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 2x\),
- \(\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = bx\).

From \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\), we get:
\[
2x = bx \implies b = 2.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\) and \(\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\)
- \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 2ay + 1\),
- \(\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = by + c\).

From \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\), we get:
\[
2ay + 1 = -(by + c).
\]

Substituting \(b = 2\), we have:
\[
2ay + 1 = -2y - c.
\]

### Step 3: Equate coefficients
- Coefficient of \(y\): \(2a = -2 \implies a = -1\),
- Constant term: \(1 = -c \implies c = -1\).

### Final Values
The values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations are:
\[
a = -1, \, b = 2, \, c = -1.
\]

### Verification
Substituting \(a = -1\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = -1\) into the function:
- Real part: \(u(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 + y\),
- Imaginary part: \(v(x, y) = 2xy - x\).

The Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied:
1. \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 2x = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 2x\),
2. \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -2y + 1 = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = -2y + 1\).

Thus, the function is analytic with these values.

### Answer
The correct option is **B: \([-1, 2, -1]\)**.
