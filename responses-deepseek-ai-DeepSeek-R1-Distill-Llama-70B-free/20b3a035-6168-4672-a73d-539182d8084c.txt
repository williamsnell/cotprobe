Okay, so I've got this economics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it out.

The question is about nominal and real income. I remember that nominal income is the actual amount of money someone earns, while real income is the purchasing power of that money, adjusted for inflation or changes in price levels. So real income would be nominal income divided by the price level, or something like that.

The problem states that in a given period, the average price level in Sherwood tripled. So if the price level was P before, now it's 3P. That means prices have gone up by three times. So inflation is pretty high here.

Robin's income increased from $30,000 to $60,000. So his nominal income doubled. Because nominal income is just the number of dollars he earns, it's gone up from 30k to 60k, which is an increase of 100%.

Now, what about real income? Real income is calculated by dividing nominal income by the price level, or sometimes by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The formula is Real Income = Nominal Income / Price Level.

In this case, the price level tripled, so the new price level is 3 times higher. Let's compute Robin's real income before and after.

Before: His nominal income was $30,000, and let's say the price level was P. So real income was 30,000 / P.

After: His nominal income is $60,000, and the price level is 3P. So real income is 60,000 / (3P).

Simplify that: 60,000 divided by 3P is 20,000 / P. Wait, that's interesting. Before, it was 30,000 / P. After, it's 20,000 / P. So his real income went down from 30k/P to 20k/P. That means his purchasing power decreased.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the math again. Oh wait, no, because the price level tripled, so maybe I should think in terms of indexes to make it clearer.

Let me assign a base period. Let's say the initial price level is 100. Then, after tripling, it's 300. 

Robin's initial nominal income is $30,000. So his real income initially is 30,000 / 100 = $300. 

After the change, his nominal income is $60,000, and the price level is 300. So real income is 60,000 / 300 = $200. 

So his real income decreased from $300 to $200, which is a decrease of $100. So in this case, his real income has gone down while his nominal income went up.

So the question is asking what happened to both. Nominal income increased (because it went from 30k to 60k), but real income decreased (from 300 to 200 in real terms).

So looking at the options, I need to find the one where nominal increased and real decreased.

Looking at the options:

Option F says: (F) Increased, Decreased.

Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are given as:

Options:

A: Stayed same, Increased

B: Increased, Increased

C: Increased, Stayed same

D: Increased, Fluctuated

E: Stayed same, Decreased

F: Increased, Decreased

G: Decreased, Decreased

H: Stayed same, Stayed same

I: Decreased, Stayed same

J: Decreased, Increased

So yes, option F is nominal increased and real decreased.

Wait, but in the initial question, the way the options are presented is a bit confusing. Each option seems to have a letter as part of the option, e.g., A: (G)... Maybe I misread that, but I think the first part is the nominal, the second the real.

So the correct answer should be that nominal income increased, real decreased. So that's option F.

To determine what happened to Robin's nominal and real income, we analyze the given information:

1. **Nominal Income**: Robin's income increased from $30,000 to $60,000. This represents a 100% increase in nominal income.

2. **Real Income**: Real income is calculated by dividing nominal income by the price level. The average price level tripled, meaning the price level increased from \( P \) to \( 3P \). 

   - Initially, real income was \( \frac{30,000}{P} \).
   - After the price level tripled, real income became \( \frac{60,000}{3P} = \frac{20,000}{P} \).

   Comparing the two, real income decreased from \( \frac{30,000}{P} \) to \( \frac{20,000}{P} \), indicating a decline in purchasing power.

Thus, Robin's nominal income increased, but his real income decreased.

The correct answer is:

**F: Increased, Decreased**

Answer: F
