Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the combustion of methane. Let me read it carefully. The reaction is CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(g). The final pressure of the gaseous products is 6.25 torr. I need to find the partial pressure of the water vapor. Hmm, right.

Alright, I remember from stoichiometry that when dealing with gases, the mole ratios can be related to partial pressures using Dalton's Law. So the idea is that the mole ratio in the balanced equation will give the ratio of partial pressures in the mixture.

Let me think about the products. From the reaction, one mole of CH4 produces one mole of CO2 and two moles of H2O. So the stoichiometric ratio between CO2 and H2O is 1:2. That means for every mole of CO2, there are two moles of H2O.

Wait, but how does that translate to partial pressures? Oh right, because in a gas mixture, the partial pressure is proportional to the number of moles. So the ratio of partial pressures should be the same as the mole ratio.

So the total pressure of the products is the sum of the partial pressures of CO2 and H2O. Let me denote the partial pressure of CO2 as P_CO2 and H2O as P_H2O.

From the reaction, the moles of CO2 and H2O are in a 1:2 ratio. So P_CO2 : P_H2O = 1 : 2. That means, if I let the partial pressure of CO2 be x, then H2O's would be 2x.

The total pressure is x (CO2) + 2x (H2O) = 3x. And according to the problem, this total is 6.25 torr. So 3x = 6.25. Solving for x, x = 6.25 / 3. Let me calculate that. 6.25 divided by 3 is approximately 2.0833 torr. So x is about 2.0833 torr for CO2.

But I need the partial pressure of H2O, which is 2x. So 2 * 2.0833 is about 4.1666 torr. Rounding that, maybe 4.166 or 4.17 torr. Looking at the options, let's check.

The options are A to J. Let me look for 4.166. Option H is 4.16 torr. That seems to match. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is precise?

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. 6.25 divided by 3 is 2.083333... Multiply by 2 gives 4.166666..., so yes, 4.166 torr. Option H is 4.16, which is the closest. So I think the answer is H.

Wait, but let me double-check if I accounted for all the gaseous products. The reaction is CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O. Are all products gaseous? Yes, CO2 is gas, H2O is stated as gas in the problem. So that's correct.

Another way to think about it: the mole ratio CO2:H2O is 1:2. So the total moles of products are 1 + 2 = 3 moles. The total pressure is 6.25 torr. So each mole contributes 6.25 /3 torr. So each mole is about 2.0833 torr. H2O is two moles, so 2 * 2.0833 is 4.1666 torr. Yep, same as before.

So the correct answer should be H:4.16 torr.

To solve the problem, we use the stoichiometry of the reaction and Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures. The reaction is:

\[
\text{CH}_4(g) + 2\text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \text{CO}_2(g) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(g).
\]

From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of the gaseous products is \( \text{CO}_2 : \text{H}_2\text{O} = 1 : 2 \). Let the partial pressure of \( \text{CO}_2 \) be \( x \). Then, the partial pressure of \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \) is \( 2x \). The total pressure of the gaseous products is given as 6.25 torr, so:

\[
x + 2x = 3x = 6.25 \, \text{torr}.
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{6.25}{3} \approx 2.0833 \, \text{torr}.
\]

The partial pressure of \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \) is:

\[
2x = 2 \times 2.0833 \approx 4.1666 \, \text{torr}.
\]

Among the options, the closest value to \( 4.1666 \, \text{torr} \) is \( 4.16 \, \text{torr} \), which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
