Okay, so I've got this philosophy question about Hume and reason. Hmm, I remember Hume is a big name in the Scottish Enlightenment. Let me think about what he said regarding reason and passions.

Wait, wasn't Hume known for his statement that "Reason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions"? Oh right, that's from his Treatise on Human Nature. So he believed that reason alone can't motivate action. Instead, it's the passions or desires that drive us, and reason's role is to help achieve those desires.

So the question is asking about Hume's view on reason. The options are A through J. Let me go through them.

Option A: "should be used to direct our passions." Hmm, does that fit? I think Hume said reason serves the passions, not directs them. Directing might mean controlling, which doesn't match.

Option B: "should operate completely independently of our passions." No, that's the opposite. Hume said reason is tied to passions, not independent.

Option C: "should be completely suppressed by our passions." No, suppression isn't right. It's more like reason assists, not gets suppressed.

Option D: "should be ignored when it comes to our passions." No, ignoring doesn't fit. Reason is active but subordinate.

Option E: "should be used to validate our passions." Not sure about validate. Maybe more about helping achieve them.

Option F: "should be used to contradict our passions." No, contradicting would mean going against, which isn't Hume's view.

Option G: "should serve our passions." Oh yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking. "Slave of the passions" means serving them.

Option H: "should be used to intensify our passions." Intensify might be too strong. Reason's role is more about guiding, not increasing passions.

Option I: "should be used to rationalize our passions." Rationalizing could mean making excuses, which isn't quite right. It's more about providing the means to achieve them.

Option J: "should be used to extinguish our passions." No, extinguish is the opposite of serving.

So the correct answer should be G. It aligns with Hume's idea that reason serves the passions, helping them achieve their goals rather than controlling or directing them.

According to Hume, reason should serve our passions. This aligns with his view that "Reason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions," meaning reason's role is to assist in achieving the goals set by our desires, rather than directing or controlling them.

Answer: G
