Question:

The lens system of a certain portrait camera may be taken as equivalent to a thin converging lens of focal length 10.0 in. How far behind the lens should the film be located to receive the image of a person seated 50.0 in. from the lens? How large will the image be in comparison with the object?

Options:

A: 17.5 in, 0.350
B: 18.0 in, 0.360
C: 8.0 in, 0.160
D: 10.0 in, 0.200
E: 11.0 in, 0.220
F: 15.0 in, 0.300
G: 25.0 in, 0.500
H: 20.0 in, 0.400
I: 12.5 in, 0.250
J: 14.0 in, 0.280

Answer:
    <think>


To solve the problem, we use the lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

Where:
- \( f = 10.0 \, \text{in} \) (focal length),
- \( d_o = 50.0 \, \text{in} \) (object distance),
- \( d_i \) is the image distance (to be determined).

Rearranging for \( d_i \):

\[
\frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{f} - \frac{1}{d_o}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{10.0} - \frac{1}{50.0} = 0.1 - 0.02 = 0.08
\]

\[
d_i = \frac{1}{0.08} = 12.5 \, \text{in}
\]

This means the film should be located 12.5 inches behind the lens.

Next, to find the magnification \( m \):

\[
m = \frac{d_i}{d_o} = \frac{12.5}{50.0} = 0.25
\]

The magnification is 0.25, meaning the image is 25% the size of the object.

Matching these values to the options, the correct choice is:

**I: 12.5 in, 0.250**

**Answer: I**
