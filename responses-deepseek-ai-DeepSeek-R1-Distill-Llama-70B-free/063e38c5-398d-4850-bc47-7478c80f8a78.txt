Question:

A man purchased a house that needed substantial repairs. The man financed the purchase of the house by borrowing funds from a bank. He signed a note to the bank and secured repayment of the loan with a mortgage. After purchasing the house, the man borrowed money from his credit union to make the repairs. The man signed a note to the credit union; this note was also secured by a mortgage on the house. Both mortgages were promptly recorded in the order granted. The man was personally liable on both loans. The man moved into the house and made the necessary repairs. He later defaulted on the debt to the bank, and the bank initiated judicial foreclosure proceedings, naming both the man and the credit union as parties to the action. An outside party acquired the house at the foreclosure sale. After the expenses of the sale and the balance due the bank have been paid, $5,000 remains in the sale the bank have been paid, $5,000 remains in the sale proceeds. The outstanding balance of the credit union loan is $20,000. The man and the credit union both claim the $5,000. There is no applicable statute. Who is entitled to the $5,000?

Options:

A: The credit union, because the man is personally liable on the debt.
B: The bank, because it initiated the foreclosure proceedings.
C: The man, because the outside party received title to the house subject to the second mortgage.
D: The man, because he was the original owner of the house.
E: The credit union, because the credit union has priority.
F: The man, because of his equitable right of redemption.
G: The outside party, because they purchased the house at the foreclosure sale.
H: The man, because he has made significant improvements to the property.
I: The credit union, because it provided the funds for the necessary repairs.
J: The credit union, because the man defaulted on the loan to the bank.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about mortgages and foreclosure. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, there's a man who bought a house that needed a lot of repairs. He financed this purchase by borrowing from a bank. He signed a note and secured the loan with a mortgage, which was recorded. Then, after buying the house, he borrowed more money from his credit union to make the repairs. He signed another note, and that was also secured by a mortgage on the house. Both mortgages were recorded in the order they were granted. The man is personally liable on both loans.

He moved into the house and did the repairs. Later, he defaulted on the debt to the bank. The bank started judicial foreclosure proceedings and named both the man and the credit union as parties. An outside party bought the house at the foreclosure sale. After paying the expenses of the sale and the bank's balance, there's $5,000 left. The credit union's loan still has an outstanding balance of $20,000. Now, both the man and the credit union are claiming the $5,000. The question is, who gets that money?

Hmm. I think I need to figure out the priority of the mortgages and what happens after foreclosure.

First, I remember that when a property is sold in foreclosure, the proceeds are used to pay off the debts in order of the mortgage priority. So the first mortgage (the bank's) gets paid first, then the second (the credit union's). But in this case, the bank was the first mortgagee because they were the first to record. The credit union's mortgage was recorded later, so it's the second mortgage.

Wait, but the question says that after the bank's debt and expenses are paid, there's $5,000 left. So that's after the first mortgage is satisfied. The credit union's loan is still $20,000. So the $5,000 must be part of the remaining proceeds after the first mortgage is paid. Does that go to the second mortgage holder, or to the mortgagor (the man)?

I remember that in a foreclosure sale, the proceeds go first to pay off the mortgages in the order of their priority. So the first mortgage gets paid first, then the second. But if there's not enough to pay all mortgages, the second might not get fully paid. But if there's money left after the first is paid, does the second get some?

Wait, but in this case, the first mortgage (bank) is being foreclosed. The bank's foreclosure sale would extinguish both mortgages, right? Because once the property is sold, the mortgages are cut off. So when the bank forecloses, they're selling the property subject to the second mortgage, or does the sale wipe out the second mortgage?

Wait no, I think when the first mortgage forecloses, the second mortgage is also foreclosed because the property is sold. But the second mortgage holder (credit union) would have a claim on the proceeds after the first is paid.

So the proceeds would go: first to pay the first mortgage (bank), then any remaining goes to the second mortgage (credit union). If there's still money left after that, it goes to the mortgagor (the man).

In this case, after the bank is paid, there's $5,000 left. The credit union's loan is $20,000, which is more than $5,000. So the credit union would get the $5,000, and the man gets nothing because the credit union's loan isn't fully satisfied.

Wait, but the options are about who gets the $5,000. So the credit union should get it because they are the next in line after the bank.

Looking at the options:

Option E: The credit union, because the credit union has priority.
Option I: The credit union, because it provided the funds for the necessary repairs. Hmm, but priority isn't based on why the loan was taken, but on the order of recording.

Wait, so the credit union's mortgage was recorded after the bank's. So the bank's mortgage has priority. When the bank forecloses, the proceeds first pay off the bank's loan. The remaining $5,000 would go to the credit union because they are the next in line. But wait, in a foreclosure by the senior lienholder (the bank), the junior lien (credit union) is extinguished, but the junior lienholder can still claim from the proceeds.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In a foreclosure, the proceeds are distributed according to the priority of the liens. So the first lien (bank) gets paid first. Any remaining goes to the second lien (credit union). If there's still money left after that, it goes to the mortgagor.

In this case, the bank's loan is paid off, and $5,000 remains. The credit union's loan is $20,000, so they can take the $5,000 towards their debt. So the credit union gets the $5,000, and the man doesn't because his personal liability is separate, but the proceeds go to the next lienholder.

So the answer should be E: The credit union, because the credit union has priority.

Wait, but another thought: when the bank forecloses, they're only foreclosing their own interest. The credit union's mortgage remains unless the credit union is named in the foreclosure. Wait, in the problem, the bank named both the man and the credit union as parties. So the foreclosure would affect both mortgages.

In that case, the sale proceeds are used to pay off the bank first, then the credit union. So yes, the $5,000 goes to the credit union.

Looking back at the options:

Option E says the credit union because it has priority. But wait, the credit union is the second mortgage, so they have lower priority than the bank. So the bank's priority is higher, which is why their loan is paid first. The remaining goes to the credit union because they are next in line.

So option E is correct because the credit union has priority over the man in the distribution of proceeds.

Wait, another option is C: The man, because the outside party received title subject to the second mortgage. But if the bank's foreclosure sale included the credit union as a party, then the credit union's lien would be extinguished, and the buyer gets the property free of that lien. But in the problem, the bank named the credit union, so their lien is foreclosed as well. So the buyer gets the property free of both liens, and the proceeds are distributed to the bank first, then credit union.

So the $5,000 goes to the credit union.

Therefore, the correct answer is E.

The question revolves around the distribution of $5,000 in foreclosure sale proceeds after the bank's loan is satisfied. The man purchased a house with a loan from the bank, secured by a mortgage recorded first. Later, he borrowed from a credit union for repairs, secured by a second mortgage, which was recorded after the bank's mortgage. Both mortgages were promptly recorded, and the man is personally liable on both loans. When the man defaulted on the bank's loan, the bank initiated judicial foreclosure, naming both the man and the credit union as parties. An outside party purchased the house at the foreclosure sale, and after paying the bank and expenses, $5,000 remained. The credit union's loan had an outstanding balance of $20,000, and both the man and the credit union claimed the $5,000.

In foreclosure, proceeds are distributed according to the priority of the liens. The bank, as the first mortgagee, has higher priority and is paid first. Any remaining proceeds are then allocated to the second mortgage holder, the credit union. If there were any balance left after satisfying the credit union's loan, it would go to the mortgagor (the man). Here, the bank is paid in full, and the $5,000 remaining is used to partially satisfy the credit union's $20,000 loan. The man does not receive any portion of the proceeds because the credit union, as the second lienholder, has priority over him in the distribution of proceeds.

Option E is correct because the credit union has priority as the second mortgagee, and the $5,000 is allocated to it before any funds would go to the man.

ANSWER: E
