Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a positively charged pion. Hmm, I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and the positive one decays into a muon and a neutrino. The question is about the kinetic energy available to the decay products.

The problem gives me the rest mass energies. The pion's mass is about 140 MeV. The muon has a rest mass of 106 MeV, and the neutrino's rest mass is zero. Wait, neutrinos have almost zero mass, right? So in this case, it's considered zero for calculation purposes.

I think the key here is conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is the pion's rest energy because it's not moving, I guess. After decay, the muon and neutrino will have their rest mass energies plus their kinetic energies.

So, the pion's rest energy is 140 MeV. The muon's rest energy is 106 MeV, and the neutrino's is 0. So the sum of the rest energies is 106 + 0 = 106 MeV. 

Subtracting that from the pion's energy gives 140 - 106 = 34 MeV. So that should be the total kinetic energy available. But wait, how is this divided between the muon and the neutrino? Oh, right, in decay processes, the total kinetic energy is the difference between the mass of the parent and the sum of the daughter particles. So that 34 MeV is the total kinetic energy they share.

Looking at the options, option C is 34 MeV. So that's the answer.

To determine the kinetic energy available to the particles created in the decay of the positively charged pion (\(\pi^+\)), we use the principle of conservation of energy. The pion's rest energy is given as 140 MeV, while the rest energies of the muon (\(\mu^-\)) and neutrino (\(\nu_\mu\)) are 106 MeV and 0 MeV, respectively.

The total rest energy of the decay products is:

\[
E_{\text{rest, total}} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 106 \, \text{MeV} + 0 \, \text{MeV} = 106 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The total energy before decay is the pion's rest energy, which is 140 MeV. After the decay, the total energy of the muon and neutrino includes both their rest energies and their kinetic energies. The kinetic energy available to the decay products is the difference between the pion's rest energy and the total rest energy of the decay products:

\[
E_{\text{kinetic, total}} = E_{\pi} - E_{\text{rest, total}} = 140 \, \text{MeV} - 106 \, \text{MeV} = 34 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Thus, the total kinetic energy available to the muon and neutrino is 34 MeV. This corresponds to option **C**.
