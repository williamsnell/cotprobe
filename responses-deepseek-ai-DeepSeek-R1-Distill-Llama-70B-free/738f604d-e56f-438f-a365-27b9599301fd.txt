Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Source 1:
"The Sovereign Congress of Venezuela, to which authority the people of the Republic of the New Granada have voluntarily stood by.
Considering:
1. "That united in a single Republic, the provinces of Venezuela and the New Granada have all proportions and ways to elevate themselves to a higher grade of power and prosperity.
2. "That constituted in separate republics, for any more stronger the ties that these have united them, so far from taking advantages of so many advantages, they would hardly consolidate and make respect their sovereignty.
3. "That these truths, highly penetrated by superior talented men and of an enlightened patriotism, had moved the governments of both republics to convene in a reunion that the vicissitudes of wars decreed and decree the following fundamental Law of the Republic of Colombia:
ARTICLE 1. The Republics of Venezuela and New Granada are from this day on united in a single one under the glorious title of Republic of Colombiaâ€¦.
ARTICLE 4. The Executive Power of the Republic will be vested on the President and in case of his defect a Vice President and his replacement will be appointed interimly by the acting Congress."

Okay, so I have this history question to answer, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question refers to two sources, Source 1 and Source 2. I need to focus on Source 1, specifically Article 1 of the Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia. The question is asking which option would most undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1 of Source 1.

First, I'll recall what Source 1 says. Source 1 is about the unification of Venezuela and New Granada into the Republic of Colombia under Simon Bolivar in 1819. Article 1 states that these two republics are uniting into a single one, called the Republic of Colombia. The considerations mention that being united allows them to elevate their power and prosperity, while being separate would make it hard to consolidate sovereignty.

So the expectation here is that unity among these regions will lead to greater strength and prosperity. The question is asking what would undermine this expectation.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Intervention by the United States and European powers in the independence of Latin American countries.
Hmm, foreign intervention could certainly cause problems. If external powers interfere, it might destabilize the new nation. But would this undermine the expectation of unity leading to strength? Maybe, but let's see other options.

Option B: Nationalism in Latin America pressing for stronger unity between the former Spanish colonies of South America.
Wait, stronger unity would actually support the expectation. If nationalism is pushing for more unity, that's in line with the idea of Gran Colombia. So this wouldn't undermine; it would reinforce. So probably not the answer.

Option C: Slave rebellions fragmenting newly independent Latin American states.
Slave rebellions could cause internal conflicts and fragmentation. If parts of the country are in rebellion, that would weaken the unified state. This could undermine the expectation because it leads to division rather than unity. Possible, but let me think about the other options.

Option D: Sectionalism of elites in the various territories of newly independent Latin American states.
Sectionalism refers to loyalty to one's own region over the central government. If elites in different territories are more focused on their own regions' interests, they might resist central authority, leading to division. This would directly undermine the unity that Article 1 expects because the elites' sectionalism could cause the republic to split apart, making it hard to consolidate power.

So comparing options C and D. Both could lead to fragmentation. But I think sectionalism among elites is more directly related to the political structure and the ability to maintain a unified government. Slave rebellions are social issues, but sectionalism is about the political cohesion needed for the republic to function as a single entity.

Therefore, the correct answer would be D: Sectionalism of elites in the various territories.

The question asks which factor would most undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1 of Source 1, which establishes the Republic of Colombia by uniting Venezuela and New Granada. Article 1 reflects the expectation that unity would lead to greater strength and prosperity. To undermine this, the factor must directly threaten the cohesion and stability of the unified state.

- **Option A**: Foreign intervention could destabilize the new nation, but it is an external factor and not as directly tied to the internal cohesion expected by the union.  
- **Option B**: Nationalism promoting stronger unity aligns with the expectations of Article 1, so it would not undermine them.  
- **Option C**: Slave rebellions could cause internal fragmentation, but they are more of a social issue rather than a direct challenge to political unity.  
- **Option D**: Sectionalism among elites refers to regional loyalty over central authority, which directly threatens the political cohesion necessary for maintaining the unified republic. This aligns most closely with undermining the expectations of Article 1.

The correct answer is **D: Sectionalism of elites in the various territories of newly independent Latin American states**.

Answer: D
