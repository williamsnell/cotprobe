Okay, so I have this question about banking and the money expansion, right? Hmm. Let me try to think this through step by step. 

The question says: A bank has total reserves of $1000 and demand deposits of $2000. What's the amount by which demand deposits can expand in the banking system, assuming a 20% required reserve ratio. Oh wait, I remember something about reserve ratios and how banks can make more loans based on their reserves.

Wait, the required reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that banks must hold in reserves. So if it's 20%, that means for every dollar deposited, the bank must keep 20 cents in reserves and can lend out the remaining 80 cents. 

But wait, how does this apply when we're calculating the total possible expansion of demand deposits? I think this is about the money multiplier effect. The formula I remember is that the maximum possible expansion is the initial deposit multiplied by 1 over the reserve ratio. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The money multiplier is 1 divided by the required reserve ratio. So if the reserve ratio is 0.20 (which is 20%), the multiplier is 1/0.20 = 5. So that means each dollar in reserves can lead to five dollars in deposits, right?

But wait, in this case, the bank already has demand deposits of $2000. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. So the total reserves are $1000. But wait, reserves include both required and excess reserves. Wait, no, wait. The required reserves would be 20% of the demand deposits. So the required reserves for the existing $2000 in demand deposits would be 0.20 * 2000 = $400. 

So if the bank has $1000 in total reserves, and $400 of that is required, then the excess reserves are 1000 - 400 = $600. Oh, right! Because the bank must hold the required reserves, but any excess can be loaned out. 

So the idea is that the bank can lend out the excess reserves. When the bank lends out, say, $600, that money gets deposited again, leading to more loans, and so on. So the total expansion is the excess reserves multiplied by the money multiplier. 

Wait, but how does the multiplier apply here? The multiplier is 1/(reserve ratio) = 5. But since the bank can only lend the excess, the maximum expansion would be excess reserves times (1/(reserve ratio - 1))? Or wait, no. The formula for the maximum possible expansion is the excess reserves divided by the required reserve ratio. Or wait, let me think again.

When a bank has excess reserves, those can be the basis for new loans. Each time a loan is made, it increases deposits, which in turn increases required reserves. But the total expansion is based on the excess reserves and the multiplier.

So the formula is: Excess Reserves * (1 / Required Reserve Ratio). Wait, no, because the multiplier is the reciprocal of the reserve ratio. So if the reserve ratio is 20%, multiplier is 5. So the maximum expansion is excess reserves times the multiplier. So 600 * 5 = 3000. Wait, but that's not one of the options. Let me double-check the options.

Looking back at the options: 

Options include A:2000, B:400, C:1200, D:800, E:10000, F:5000, G:3000, H:600, I:1600, J:7000.

So G is $3000. But wait, wait a second. When calculating the expansion, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me think of it another way.

The formula for the potential expansion of demand deposits is (Excess Reserves)/(Required Reserve Ratio). So 600 / 0.2 = 3000, which matches what I got before. So G is $3000. But wait, another thought: the question might be referring to the maximum possible expansion, which could be calculated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (Excess Reserves) multiplied by (1/(1 - required reserve ratio)). Wait, that's another way to think about it. No, because 1 - required reserve ratio is the fraction that can be loaned out each time.

Wait, let me think through the process step by step. The bank has $600 in excess reserves. They can lend out $600. When that $600 is deposited into another bank, that bank must hold 20% as reserves, which is $120. So that bank can lend out $480. Then that $480 is deposited, and the next bank holds 20% ($96) and lends $384, and so on.

So the total expansion is 600 + 480 + 384 + ... until it approaches a limit. The sum of this geometric series is a/(1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. So a is 600, and the ratio is 0.8 (since each time 80% is lent out). So 600 / (1 - 0.8) = 600 / 0.2 = 3000. So that's correct.

So the maximum expansion is $3000. Looking at the options, option G is $3000. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but wait. The question says "the amount by which demand deposits can expand in the banking system". So in the system as a whole, the expansion is $3000. So the total demand deposits can increase by $3000, so possible answer is G.

Wait another thing: initial demand deposits are $2000, but the question is asking by how much they can expand. So the total possible expansion is $3000, but the options don't have that as a choice for the change. Wait, no, looking back, the options include G: $3000, which is the correct figure.

So I think the correct answer is G.

To determine the amount by which demand deposits can expand in the banking system, we start with the given data:

- **Total reserves**: $1000  
- **Demand deposits**: $2000  
- **Required reserve ratio**: 20% (or 0.20).  

### Step 1: Calculate required reserves
The required reserves are 20% of demand deposits:  
\[
\text{Required Reserves} = 0.20 \times 2000 = 400.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate excess reserves
Excess reserves are the total reserves minus the required reserves:  
\[
\text{Excess Reserves} = 1000 - 400 = 600.
\]

### Step 3: Determine the money multiplier
The money multiplier is the reciprocal of the required reserve ratio:  
\[
\text{Money Multiplier} = \frac{1}{\text{Required Reserve Ratio}} = \frac{1}{0.20} = 5.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the maximum expansion of demand deposits
The maximum expansion of demand deposits is the excess reserves multiplied by the money multiplier:  
\[
\text{Maximum Expansion} = \text{Excess Reserves} \times \text{Money Multiplier} = 600 \times 5 = 3000.
\]

### Final Answer
The demand deposits can expand by **$3000** in the banking system. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**G: $3000.**
