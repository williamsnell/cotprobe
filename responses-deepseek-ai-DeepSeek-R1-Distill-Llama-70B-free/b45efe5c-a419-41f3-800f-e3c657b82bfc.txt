Question:

A landlord rented an apartment to a tenant for $250 per month in accordance with a month-to-month agreement. On September 3, the landlord mailed the following letter to the tenant:"September 2 In consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged, I hereby give you an option for 20 days from the above date to sign a two-year lease at $225 per month, provided you pay two months' rent in advance. "The tenant received the letter on September 4, but did not read it until September 5. On September 23, the tenant telephoned the landlord and said, "I want to give you the $450 and sign the two-year lease as soon as possible. " The landlord replied, "I've change my mind. I do not want to sign a lease with you. Moreover, I want you to vacate the apartment immediately. " At no time after receiving the landlord's letter on September 4 did the tenant pay him the one-dollar consideration. Did the landlord's letter constitute an effective offer for a two-year lease?

Options:

A: No, because the landlord can retract the offer at any time before the tenant accepts.
B: No, unless the tenant paid or tendered to the landlord the one-dollar consideration.
C: Yes, because it manifested a willingness to enter into a specific bargain that could be concluded by the tenant's assent.
D: No, because the tenant did not immediately respond to the letter.
E: Yes, because the landlord cannot change their mind once an offer is made.
F: Yes, because consideration for the option can be infeffed from the previous month-to-month lease.
G: No, because the tenant did not pay the two months' rent in advance.
H: Yes, because the tenant expressed the intent to sign the lease within the specified timeframe.
I: No, because it contained a condition precedent to execution of the proposed lease.
J: Yes, because the tenant has the right to accept the offer within the 20 days, regardless of the landlord's change of mind.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically regarding offers and options. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is between a landlord and a tenant. They have a month-to-month agreement where the tenant pays $250 per month. The landlord sends a letter on September 3 offering the tenant an option to sign a two-year lease at $225 per month, but with some conditions. The option is for 20 days starting from September 2. The tenant receives the letter on September 4 but doesn't read it until September 5. On September 23, the tenant calls the landlord to accept the offer and pay the $450 (which is two months' rent in advance). However, the landlord refuses, saying he's changed his mind and wants the tenant to vacate immediately.

The question is whether the landlord's letter was an effective offer for a two-year lease. The options are from A to J.

First, I need to recall the rules about offers and options in contract law. I remember that an offer is a manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, which is capable of being accepted. But for it to be binding, certain criteria must be met, especially regarding options.

An option is typically a promise to keep an offer open for a specified period. Without consideration, the offer can be revoked at any time, but if there's consideration, the offer becomes irrevocable during the option period. Here, the landlord included "in consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged," which suggests that the landlord is offering an option supported by consideration.

Wait, but the tenant didn't pay the one dollar. Does that matter? I think that for an option to be enforceable, the consideration must be given. If the tenant didn't pay the dollar, maybe the option isn't valid. But wait, the offer says "in consideration of one dollar," so maybe the offer itself is the option, and the consideration is the $1. But the tenant didn't pay it. Hmm.

Alternatively, sometimes courts can find consideration through the actions of the parties. But in this case, the tenant didn't pay the dollar. So without the consideration, maybe the landlord's offer wasn't an effective option and could be revoked before acceptance.

Looking at the timeline, the offer was made on September 2, with a 20-day option period. The tenant received it on September 4 and read it on September 5. The tenant tried to accept on September 23, which is within 20 days from September 2 (September 22 is the 20th day, so September 23 is day 21, which might be too late). Wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate that. September 2 plus 20 days: September has 30 days. So September 2 + 20 days is September 22. So the option would expire on September 22. The tenant called on September 23, which is one day late. But wait, the question says the tenant received the letter on September 4, read it on September 5. So the 20-day period starts on September 2, regardless of when the tenant received it. So the offer would end on September 22. So the tenant accepted on the 23rd, which is after the option period. But wait, the question is whether the offer was effective, not whether the acceptance was timely. So maybe that's a separate issue.

But the main point is whether the landlord's letter was an effective offer. So, was there consideration for the option? The landlord required a $1 consideration, but the tenant didn't pay it. So without the consideration, the landlord could revoke the offer before the tenant accepted. Because without consideration, the option isn't irrevocable.

Wait, but the letter says "in consideration of one dollar," so perhaps the offer itself is the option, and the consideration is the $1. But since the tenant didn't pay the dollar, maybe the option isn't valid. Alternatively, maybe the consideration is the tenant's promise to sign the lease, but that might not be sufficient.

Wait, but the offer says "I hereby give you an option for 20 days... provided you pay two months' rent in advance." So the option is given in exchange for $1, but the tenant didn't pay it. So without that consideration, the option isn't binding. So the landlord can revoke it at any time, even before the tenant tries to accept.

So looking at the options, option B says "No, unless the tenant paid or tendered the one dollar consideration." So the answer would be B because the landlord's offer wasn't effective unless the tenant paid the dollar, which they didn't.

But wait, another angle: sometimes, consideration for an option can be the forbearance of a legal right. For example, if the landlord is offering not to raise the rent or something. But in this case, the consideration is one dollar, which the tenant didn't provide. So without that, the option isn't enforceable. So the landlord can revoke the offer before acceptance.

Alternatively, option C says "Yes, because it manifested a willingness to enter into a specific bargain..." But that would be true if the offer was binding. But without consideration, the offer isn't binding, so the landlord can revoke it.

So the correct answer would be B: No, unless the tenant paid or tendered the one-dollar consideration.

Wait, but another thought: the letter was an offer for a lease, but also an option to accept within 20 days. So the option part requires consideration. Without it, the landlord can revoke the offer any time before acceptance. So the offer wasn't effective because the tenant didn't pay the $1, making the option unenforceable. Therefore, the landlord could retract the offer before the tenant accepted, which is what happened.

So the answer must be B.

The question revolves around whether the landlord's letter constituted an effective offer for a two-year lease. To determine this, it is essential to analyze the concepts of offers and options in contract law. An offer is a manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, which can be accepted by the offeree. However, for an offer to be irrevocable (such as an option), it typically requires consideration. 

In this case, the landlord's letter explicitly states that the option is given "in consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged." This indicates that the landlord intended the $1 payment as the consideration for the option. However, the tenant did not pay the $1, and without this consideration, the option is not binding. As a result, the landlord retains the right to revoke the offer at any time before acceptance, even within the 20-day period specified in the letter.

Given that the tenant did not tender the required $1 consideration, the landlord's offer was not effectively binding. Therefore, the landlord could legally retract the offer before the tenant attempted to accept it on September 23. This makes Option B the correct answer, as the effectiveness of the offer was contingent upon the tenant paying or tendering the one-dollar consideration, which did not occur.

**Answer: B**
