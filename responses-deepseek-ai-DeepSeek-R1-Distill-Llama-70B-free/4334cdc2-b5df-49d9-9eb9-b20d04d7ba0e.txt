Question:

A woman inherited her father's farm when he died testate. Prior to her father's death, the woman had already taken over the operations on the father's farm due to his declining health. Recently, the woman had granted a coal company rights to strip-mine coal from underneath the farm. Their agreement stipulated that the coal company would pay the woman a per-ton royalty for the coal extracted. In addition, the coal company agreed to fill in the excavated area and replace top soil on the surface of the land. After the coal company commenced its strip-mining operations, the woman noticed that the company was not filling in the excavated area as previously agreed. However, because the company paid the woman all the coal royalties from the strip mining, she did not voice any objection regarding its failure to replace the top soil. Two years later, the coal company had now completed its strip-mining operation under its arrangement with the woman. The coal company's right to strip-mine coal from the woman's property would be an example of a (an)

Options:

A: constructive trust.
B: easement appurtenant.
C: servient estate.
D: voluntary waste.
E: license.
F: easement in gross.
G: tenancy in common.
H: profit-a-prendre.
I: adverse possession.
J: easement by necessity.

Okay, so I have this question about property law, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see. The question is about a woman who inherited her father's farm. Before her father died, she took over the farm operations because he was in poor health. Then she granted a coal company the right to strip-mine coal from underneath the farm. The agreement said the company would pay her a royalty per ton and also fill in the excavated area and replace the top soil. But then, the company didn't fill in the area as agreed, though they did pay all the royalties. Two years later, the mining is done, and the question is about what kind of right the coal company had.

Hmm, so the key here is to determine the type of property interest or right that the coal company was granted. Let's think about the different options given.

The options are A through J. Let me go through each one to see which fits.

Option A: Constructive trust. That usually comes into play when someone holds property but is obliged to transfer it to another. Doesn't seem right here because it's about a right to use the land, not holding property for someone else.

Option B: Easement appurtenant. This is an easement that benefits another piece of land (the dominant estate) and is attached to it. Like a right of way. But here, the coal company isn't necessarily using this to benefit another property they own. So maybe not appurtenant unless the company owns adjacent land, which isn't stated.

Option C: Servient estate. That's the estate that is burdened by an easement. So the woman's farm would be the servient estate if there's an easement. But the question is about the coal company's right, so this might not be the answer.

Option D: Voluntary waste. That's when a tenant does something that reduces the value of the property, like letting it fall into disrepair. But the woman didn't do that; she allowed mining, which is more about granting a right than committing waste. So probably not D.

Option E: License. A license is a personal right to use the land, not transferable. Like a ticket to a concert. But the coal company has a contract for mining, which might be more than a license because it's a commercial arrangement, possibly transferable. So maybe E is not the right choice.

Option F: Easement in gross. This is an easement that benefits a person or company rather than a parcel of land. So like utility lines, where the company has the right to run lines over someone's property. Since the coal company is extracting minerals, which is a commercial purpose, this could be an easement in gross. So F is a possibility.

Option G: Tenancy in common. That's a form of co-ownership, but here the woman owns the farm outright, so G isn't relevant.

Option H: Profit-a-prendre. This is a right to take something from the land, like minerals. So this is exactly what's happening here. The company has the right to extract coal, which is a profit. So H seems like a strong candidate.

Option I: Adverse possession. That's when someone takes possession of land without the owner's consent, which isn't the case here because the woman gave permission. So I is out.

Option J: Easement by necessity. This arises when a parcel of land is landlocked and needs access. The scenario doesn't mention any necessity, so probably not J.

So now I'm thinking between F and H. Both could fit, but I need to recall the exact definitions. An easement in gross is a right to use the land, like running lines, whereas a profit is the right to take something from the land. Since the company is extracting coal, which is taking a resource, this is a profit, specifically a profit-a-prendre. So H would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes mining rights are considered easements. Let me think again. A profit is a type of easement, actually. So profit-a-prendre is a specific kind of easement that allows the holder to remove resources. So H is correct because it's about taking minerals, which fits the profit description.

Yes, I think H is the right answer.

The question revolves around determining the type of property interest granted to the coal company by the woman. The coal company was allowed to strip-mine coal from the woman's farm in exchange for royalties and an agreement to restore the land, though the restoration part was not fulfilled. The key is to identify the nature of the coal company's right.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Constructive trust** involves holding property for another, which doesn't apply here.  
- **B: Easement appurtenant** benefits another parcel of land, but there's no indication the coal company owns adjacent land.  
- **C: Servient estate** refers to the burdened estate, which is the woman's farm, not the coal company's right.  
- **D: Voluntary waste** involves reducing property value, which isn't relevant since the woman granted the right to mine.  
- **E: License** is a personal, non-transferable right, but the coal company's commercial arrangement suggests something more formal.  
- **F: Easement in gross** benefits a person or company, often for commercial purposes, which could apply here.  
- **G: Tenancy in common** involves co-ownership, which isn't the case.  
- **H: Profit-a-prendre** is a right to take resources from the land, such as minerals, which fits the coal company's activity.  
- **I: Adverse possession** requires unauthorized use, which isn't applicable since the woman granted permission.  
- **J: Easement by necessity** arises from landlocked property, which isn't mentioned here.  

While **F: easement in gross** could apply, the coal company's right to extract coal aligns more precisely with **H: profit-a-prendre**, as it specifically involves the right to remove resources from the land. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**H: profit-a-prendre.**

Answer: H
