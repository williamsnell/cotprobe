Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the period of a signal x₁(t) which is given by the equation cos(3πt) minus 4 times cos(5πt - 0.5π). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on signal periods, but I think I remember that the period of a cosine function is related to its coefficient.

Wait, right, the general form is cos(ωt + φ), and the period T is 2π divided by the absolute value of ω. So each term in the signal will have its own period based on their ω values.

Looking at the first term, cos(3πt). The ω here is 3π, so the period T1 would be 2π/(3π) = 2/3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2π divided by ω. So ω is 3π, so 2π/(3π) simplifies to 2/3. So T1 is 2/3.

The second term is 4cos(5πt - 0.5π). The coefficient here is 5π, so ω is 5π. So the period T2 is 2π/(5π) = 2/5.

But wait, the overall signal is a combination of these two terms. So I need to find the period of the entire signal x₁(t). I remember that when you have a sum of periodic signals, the overall period is the least common multiple (LCM) of their individual periods. But wait, does that apply here?

Let me think again. The LCM of the two periods T1 and T2 would give the period after which the entire signal repeats. So I need to compute LCM of 2/3 and 2/5.

Hmm, calculating LCM of fractions. Oh right, the formula is LCM(a/b, c/d) = LCM(a,c) / GCD(b,d). Or wait, maybe it's the LCM of the numerators divided by the GCD of the denominators. So for T1 = 2/3 and T2=2/5.

Numerators are 2 and 2. Their LCM is 2. Denominators are 3 and 5. Their GCD is 1 because 3 and 5 are coprime. So LCM of T1 and T2 is 2/1 = 2.

Wait, does that make sense? Let me check. If the first term repeats every 2/3 units and the second every 2/5, then the combined signal repeats when both terms align again. So the LCM of 2/3 and 2/5 should be 2. Because 2 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 2/3 and 2/5. Because 2 divided by (2/3) is 3, which is an integer, and 2 divided by (2/5) is 5, also integer. So yes, the period of x₁(t) is 2.

Looking at the options, option H is 2. So the answer should be H.

To determine the period of the signal \( x_1(t) = \cos(3\pi t) - 4\cos(5\pi t - 0.5\pi) \), we analyze the periods of its individual components. 

1. For the first term, \( \cos(3\pi t) \), the angular frequency \( \omega \) is \( 3\pi \). The period \( T_1 \) is calculated as:
   \[
   T_1 = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi}{3\pi} = \frac{2}{3}.
   \]

2. For the second term, \( \cos(5\pi t - 0.5\pi) \), the angular frequency \( \omega \) is \( 5\pi \). The period \( T_2 \) is:
   \[
   T_2 = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi}{5\pi} = \frac{2}{5}.
   \]

The overall period of the signal \( x_1(t) \) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the individual periods \( T_1 = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( T_2 = \frac{2}{5} \). To compute the LCM of fractions, we use the formula:
\[
\text{LCM of } \frac{a}{b} \text{ and } \frac{c}{d} = \frac{\text{LCM}(a, c)}{\text{GCD}(b, d)}.
\]
Here, \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), \( c = 2 \), and \( d = 5 \). The LCM of \( 2 \) and \( 2 \) is \( 2 \), and the GCD of \( 3 \) and \( 5 \) is \( 1 \). Thus:
\[
\text{LCM of } \frac{2}{3} \text{ and } \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2}{1} = 2.
\]

Therefore, the period of the signal \( x_1(t) \) is \( 2 \). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

H: 2.
