Okay, so I've got this question about economics, specifically about autonomous increases in spending. Hmm, I remember from my classes that autonomous means something that happens on its own, not caused by other factors like income changes. But wait, let me think this through.

The question is asking what an autonomous increase in spending means. The options are A through D. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says it's a decrease in total spending because of lower income. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Autonomous spending shouldn't be related to income changes. Plus, it's talking about a decrease, but the question is about an increase. So A is probably not the correct answer.

Option B: An increase proportional to income. Oh, right, that sounds like induced spending. Because induced spending is when spending increases as income goes up. So B is talking about induced, not autonomous.

Option C: An increase in spending not due to income. That fits with what I remember about autonomous spending. Autonomous changes are independent of income, like a decision to spend more because of something else, like consumer confidence or government policy.

Option D: Increase in income leading to higher spending. Again, that's induced because it's directly tied to income. So D isn't the right choice either.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be C. Autonomous spending isn't caused by income changes; it's its own thing. For example, if people decide to spend more because they expect the economy to do well, that's an autonomous increase.

The correct answer is C. An autonomous increase in spending refers to an increase in total spending that occurs independently of changes in income. It is driven by other factors, such as changes in consumer confidence or government policies, rather than being directly tied to income levels.
