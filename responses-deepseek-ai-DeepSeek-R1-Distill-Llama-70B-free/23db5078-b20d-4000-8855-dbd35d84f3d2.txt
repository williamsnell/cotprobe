At trial, the shopper's housekeeper testified that the shopper was bedridden and unable to work for a month because of the sprained back she suffered when she fell at the mall. The housekeeper also testified that about one week after the shopper returned home from the hospital, the shopper told her, "My back is really killing me. The pain is excruciating. It'll be a miracle if I can ever stand up again. " The mall's counsel then moved to strike the housekeeper's testimony. The motion should be

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question about hearsay exceptions. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is a shopper suing the mall owner for negligence after slipping and falling. The shopper's housekeeper testified about two things: first, that the shopper was bedridden for a month, and second, that the shopper made a statement about her back pain a week after returning home.

The question is whether the mall's counsel's motion to strike the housekeeper's testimony should be granted or denied. The options are about whether the testimony is hearsay and if it falls under any exception.

So, first, I need to identify if the statement is hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the shopper's statement to the housekeeper is being offered to show the severity of her injuries, I think. So yes, it's hearsay because it's a statement made outside of court being used to prove she was in pain.

Now, the next step is to determine if this hearsay falls under any recognized exception. The main exceptions I remember are present sense impression, excited utterance, declaration of present bodily condition, and statements for medical treatment.

Let's look at each possible exception:

1. **Present Sense Impression (FRE 803(1))**: This applies to statements describing an event made while the declarant is perceiving it or immediately thereafter. Here, the shopper made the statement a week after the incident. That's probably too much time, so this exception might not apply.

2. **Excited Utterance (FRE 803(2))**: This requires the statement to be made under the stress of a startling event. The fall was the event, but the statement was made a week later. The shopper was at home, so the stress of the event might have passed. This exception likely doesn't fit.

3. **Declaration of Present Bodily Condition (FRE 803(3))**: Statements about the declarant's current bodily condition are admissible. However, this exception doesn't apply to statements of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the declarant's will. The shopper's statement about her back pain describes her current condition, so this might apply. Wait, but when she made the statement, she was a week post-hospital. Is that considered present? I think so, because it's about how she's feeling at the time of the statement.

Wait, there's another consideration. The statement is about her current pain and her fear of not being able to stand again. That's about her present bodily condition when she spoke.

But wait, I remember that under FRE 803(3), statements about bodily condition are admissible, but if the statement is about a condition that's being used to prove the underlying event (like the cause of the injury), it might not be allowed. Or does it matter? No, because the exception allows it regardless, as it's about the condition at the time of the statement.

So if the statement is about her current pain, it's admissible under this exception.

Looking at the options, option F says the statement is admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition. So option F would be correct, and the motion to strike would be denied.

Wait, let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option C is excited utterance, which I don't think applies because the time has passed. Option D is adoptive admission, which requires the statement to be offered against the party who adopted it, but that's not the case here.

Option G is present sense impression, which again, the timing is off. Option H is for medical treatment, which requires that the statement was made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment. The shopper was talking to her housekeeper, not a medical professional, so that exception doesn't apply.

So the correct exception is declaration of present bodily condition under FRE 803(3), making the testimony admissible and the motion to strike denied. So the answer should be F.

The shopper's statement to the housekeeper is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., the severity of the shopper's injuries). To determine whether it is admissible, it must fall under a recognized hearsay exception.

1. **Present Sense Impression (FRE 803(1))**: This exception does not apply because the statement was made a week after the incident, which is too much time to qualify as a present sense impression.

2. **Excited Utterance (FRE 803(2))**: This exception does not apply because the statement was made a week after the fall, and the stress of the event had likely passed.

3. **Declaration of Present Bodily Condition (FRE 803(3))**: This exception applies because the shopper's statement describes her current bodily condition (back pain and inability to stand) at the time of the statement. This makes the statement admissible under this exception.

4. **Statement for Medical Treatment (FRE 803(4))**: This exception does not apply because the statement was made to the housekeeper, not for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment.

5. **Adoptive Admission (FRE 801(d)(2))**: This exception does not apply because the statement was not adopted by the opposing party in a way that manifests agreement.

6. **Other Options**: Options A, B, E, I, and J are incorrect because they misapply the law or fail to recognize the applicable exception.

The correct answer is that the motion to strike should be denied because the shopper's statement is admissible as a declaration of present bodily condition under FRE 803(3).

Answer: F
