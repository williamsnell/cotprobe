Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the refractive indices of rock salt for different Fraunhofer lines. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

The question is asking me to calculate the reciprocal of the dispersive power. Hmm, I remember that dispersive power has something to do with how much the light bends, or refracts, in a material, and it's related to the refractive indices at different wavelengths.

Wait, Fraunhofer lines are those dark lines in the solar spectrum, right? Each corresponds to a specific wavelength. The lines mentioned here are C, D, and F. I think their wavelengths are in the order of C (maybe around 656 nm for hydrogen, but wait, no, Fraunhofer lines are for different elements. Let me think, the D line is sodium, I believe. Oh wait, but the exact wavelengths might not be needed here because maybe the problem is about the formula.)

Dispersive power... I think the formula for dispersive power (omega) is (n_F - n_C)/(n_D - 1). Or wait, is it (n_F - n_C)/(n_D - 1)? Or maybe it's (n_F - n_C)/(n_D - 1) multiplied by something else. Wait, no, I think the dispersive power is the difference in refractive indices between two lines divided by the difference for another line. Let me think again.

Oh right! The dispersive power is calculated as (n_F - n_C)/(n_D - 1), where n_F is the refractive index for the F line, n_C for the C line, and n_D for the D line. So the reciprocal would be 1 divided by that value.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get the formula correct. I've heard it as ω = (n_F - n_C)/(n_D - 1). So reciprocal would be (n_D -1)/(n_F -n_C).

Wait no, no, wait. Let me think again. The dispersive power is a measure of how much the refractive index changes with wavelength. So it's the difference in refractive indices between two widely separated Fraunhofer lines (like F and C, which are in the blue and red regions, respectively) divided by the difference in refractive index between a middle line (like D) and air (n=1).

So, the formula for dispersive power ω is (n_F - n_C)/(n_D -1). Therefore, the reciprocal would be 1/ω, which is (n_D -1)/(n_F -n_C).

Wait, but let me make sure. I've seen some sources where ω is (n_F - n_C)/(n_D -1). So if that's correct, then the reciprocal is (n_D -1)/(n_F -n_C).

So the given data is:

n_C = 1.5404

n_D = 1.5441

n_F = 1.5531

So let's compute n_F - n_C first.

1.5531 - 1.5404 = 0.0127.

Then, compute n_D - 1 = 1.5441 - 1 = 0.5441.

Wait wait, no. Because in the denominator of ω, it's (n_D - 1). So ω = (0.0127)/(0.5441) = ?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, n_F is 1.5531 and n_C is 1.5404, so n_F - n_C is 1.5531 - 1.5404 = 0.0127. Correct.

n_D is 1.5441, so n_D -1 is 0.5441.

So ω is 0.0127 / 0.5441.

Calculating that: 0.0127 / 0.5441 ≈ 0.02335.

So the reciprocal of ω would be 1 divided by 0.02335, which is approximately 42.84.

Let me compute that more accurately.

0.0127 / 0.5441: Let's see.

0.5441 × 0.0233 = approx 0.0127 (since 0.5441 * 0.02 is 0.010882, and 0.5441 * 0.0033 is about 0.001795, adding up to 0.012677, which is close to 0.0127.)

So 1/ω ≈ 1 / 0.0233 ≈ approx 42.9.

Looking at the options, option G is 42.84, which is close. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't flip the formula. Because sometimes I might confuse which way it goes. So let's recheck.

ω = (n_F - n_C) / (n_D -1). So reciprocal is (n_D -1)/(n_F -n_C).

Which is 0.5441 / 0.0127.

Calculating that: 0.5441 ÷ 0.0127.

Let me compute 0.5441 / 0.0127.

Well, 0.5441 ÷ 0.0127 = ?

I can multiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to make it 5441 / 127.

So 127 × 42 = 5334. 5334 is less than 5441. 127 × 42.8 = 127*(42 + 0.8) = 5334 + 101.6 = 5435.6. That's close to 5441.

The difference is 5441 -5435.6 =5.4.

So 5.4 /127 = approx 0.0425. So 42.8 + 0.0425 ≈ 42.8425.

So approximately 42.84. Which matches option G.

To calculate the reciprocal of the dispersive power, we use the formula:

\[
\frac{1}{\omega} = \frac{n_D - 1}{n_F - n_C}
\]

where:
- \(n_C = 1.5404\),
- \(n_D = 1.5441\),
- \(n_F = 1.5531\).

### Step 1: Compute \(n_F - n_C\)
\[
n_F - n_C = 1.5531 - 1.5404 = 0.0127
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(n_D - 1\)
\[
n_D - 1 = 1.5441 - 1 = 0.5441
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\frac{1}{\omega}\)
\[
\frac{1}{\omega} = \frac{0.5441}{0.0127} \approx 42.84
\]

### Final Answer:
The reciprocal of the dispersive power is approximately **42.84**, which corresponds to option **G**.
