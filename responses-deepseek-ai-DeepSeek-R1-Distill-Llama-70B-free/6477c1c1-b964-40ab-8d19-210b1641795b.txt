Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a cylindrical tank draining water. Hmm, I need to find out how long it takes for the tank to empty. The tank's height is 4 meters, radius is 1 meter. The hole is a square with each side 2 cm. Hmm, right.

Wait, I remember something about Torricelli's Law. Oh yeah, it's used for the efflux of fluids. Torricelli's Law says the speed of fluid flowing out of an orifice is sqrt(2gh), where h is the height of the fluid above the hole. But wait, that's when the cross-sectional area of the hole is much smaller than the tank, which it is here because the hole is small.

So the volume flow rate would be the area of the hole multiplied by the velocity. The hole is square, so area A is (2 cm)^2. Wait, converting to meters: 2 cm is 0.02 m, so area is 0.02 * 0.02 = 0.0004 m². So area A = 0.0004 m².

The volume flow rate dV/dt is A * sqrt(2gh), but wait, h is changing as the tank drains. So I can't just use a constant flow rate. I need to set up an integral.

The tank is a cylinder, so the volume V is πr²H, but since it's draining, H changes with time. Let me denote H as the height of the water at time t. So V = π (1)^2 H = π H. So dV/dt is π dH/dt.

Wait, because the volume is decreasing, dV/dt is negative. So -π dH/dt = A sqrt(2g H). Let me write that down:

-π dH/dt = A sqrt(2g H)

I can rearrange this to solve for dt:

dt = - (π / (A sqrt(2g))) * (1 / sqrt(H)) dH

Wait, but integrating from H=4m down to H=0. So I can set up the integral from H=4 to H=0.

The negative sign indicates that H is decreasing, so when I flip the limits, the integral becomes positive. So the time T is the integral from H=0 to H=4 of (π / (A sqrt(2g))) * (1 / sqrt(H)) dH.

Putting in the numbers:

A = 0.0004 m²
g is 9.81 m/s²
So sqrt(2g) = sqrt(2 *9.81) ≈ sqrt(19.62) ≈ 4.429 m/s

So (π / (0.0004 * 4.429)) ) is a constant factor.

Let me compute that factor:

0.0004 * 4.429 = approximately 0.0017716

π / 0.0017716 ≈ 3.1416 / 0.0017716 ≈ let's see, 3.1416 / 0.0017716 ≈ 1771. Hmm, wait, 3.1416 / 0.0017716 is roughly 1771. So 1771 seconds per something? No, wait, let me compute it accurately.

Wait, 0.0004 is 4e-4. 4e-4 *4.429 is 1.7716e-3.

So π/(1.7716e-3) = 3.1416 / 0.0017716 ≈ let me calculate that. Let me compute 0.0017716 * 1771 = approx 3.1416, because 0.0017716 * 1771 = 3.1416, so yes, that's correct. So the factor is approximately 1771. So the integral becomes T = 1771 * ∫ (1/sqrt(H)) dH from 0 to 4.

Wait, the integral of 1/sqrt(H) dH is 2*sqrt(H). So evaluating from 0 to 4 gives 2*sqrt(4) - 0 = 2*2 =4.

So T = 1771 *4 = 7084 seconds. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 7084. Let me check the options again. The options are A:5000, B:3200, C:8500, D:5500, E:9800, F:7142, G:7600, H:3750, I:6500, J:4500.

Hmm, 7084 is close to option F:7142. But wait, maybe my approximations led to a small error. Let me recheck the calculations more accurately.

Wait, let me recalculate the factor without approximating early.

Compute A * sqrt(2g): A is 0.02 m squared, wait no, A is (0.02 m)^2? Wait no, the area of the square hole is (0.02 m)^2, which is 0.0004 m². Right.

So sqrt(2g) is sqrt(19.62) ≈ 4.42948 m/s (exact would be better, but let's use precise value).

So the denominator is A * sqrt(2g) = 0.0004 *4.42948 ≈ 0.00177179 m²·s⁻¹.

Wait, no, the denominator is A * sqrt(2g), but in the expression for dt, it's (A * sqrt(2g)) in the denominator.

So the factor is π/(A * sqrt(2g)).

So let's compute that exactly:

A=0.0004 m², sqrt(2g)=sqrt(2*9.81)=sqrt(19.62)=4.42948 m/s.

So denominator: 0.0004 *4.42948 = 0.0004 *4.42948 = 0.001771792.

So π / 0.001771792 = let's calculate that.

π is approximately 3.14159265.

3.14159265 / 0.001771792 = ?

Let me compute 0.001771792 × 1771 = 0.001771792 *1771.

Well, 0.001 *1771 = 1.771, and 0.000771792 *1771 ≈ let's see, 0.0007 *1771=1.2397, and 0.000071792*1771≈0.127. So total is approx 1.771 +1.2397=3.0107 +0.127=3.1377. Close to π, which is approx 3.1416.

So 0.001771792 ×1771 ≈3.1377, which is just a bit less than π. So 3.1416/0.001771792 = approx 1771. So 1771. So T=1771 * (2*sqrt(4))=1771 *4=7084 seconds. That's what I had before.

But the options don't have 7084. The closest is F:7142. Hmm, maybe I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me do the integral more accurately.

The integral is T = (π/(A sqrt(2g))) ) * ∫ from 0 to 4 of H^(-1/2) dH.

Which is (π/(A sqrt(2g))) ) * [2 H^(1/2)] from 0 to4.

So that's (π/(A sqrt(2g))) * 2*(sqrt(4) -0) = (π/(A sqrt(2g))) * 4.

Wait, so T = (π *4 )/(A sqrt(2g)).

Putting in the numbers:

π=3.14159265, A=0.0004, sqrt(2g)=4.42948.

So,

T = (4 *3.14159265) / (0.0004 *4.42948)

Compute denominator: 0.0004 *4.42948 = 0.001771792.

Numerator: 4 *3.14159265 ≈12.56637.

So T=12.56637 / 0.001771792 ≈ let's compute that.

12.56637 /0.001771792.

Let me compute 0.001771792 × 7080 = ?

0.001771792 *7080 = 7080 *0.001771792.

Compute 7080 * 0.001 =7.08.

7080 * 0.000771792=?

Compute 7080 *0.0007 =4.956.

7080 *0.000071792= Let's compute 7080 *0.00007=0.496, and 7080 *0.000001792≈approx 0.01266.

So total 0.496 +0.01266≈0.50866.

So 0.000771792 *7080 =4.956 +0.50866≈5.46466.

So total 0.001771792 *7080≈7.08 +5.46466≈12.54466.

But our numerator is 12.56637.

So 7080 gives us about 12.54466, which is a bit less than 12.56637.

The difference is 12.56637 -12.54466=0.02171.

How much more time is needed to cover 0.02171?

Each second adds 0.001771792 to the product. So 0.02171 /0.001771792 ≈approx 12.23 seconds.

So total T≈7080 +12.23≈7092 seconds.

Wait, but wait, this is getting a bit messy, perhaps I should do the exact division.

Compute 12.56637 / 0.001771792.

Let me write it as 12.56637 / 0.001771792 = x.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1e6 to eliminate decimals:

12.56637 *1e6 / 1771.792 ≈12566370 /1771.792 ≈ Let me compute 1771.792 *7090.

Wait, 1771 *7090= ?

Wait, 1771 *7000=12,397,000.

1771 *90=159,390.

So total 12,397,000 +159,390=12,556,390.

But the numerator is 12,566,370.

So 12,556,390 is 10,000 less than 12,566,370.

Wait, 1771.792 *x =12,566,370.

Wait x=7090 gives 12,556,390.

So the difference is 12,566,370 -12,556,390=9,980.

So 9,980 /1771.792 ≈approx 5.63.

So x≈7090 +5.63≈7095.63 seconds.

Wait, that's about 7,095.63 seconds. Hmm.

But wait, this doesn't match any of the options. The closest option to 7,000 is F:7142 and G:7600. Wait, 7142 is higher than 7095, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the integral more accurately without approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the setup.

Wait, the area A is 0.02 m squared? No, wait, the hole is a square of side 2 cm, which is 0.02 m. So area is (0.02)^2=0.0004 m². That's correct.

Wait, Torricelli's law is v=sqrt(2gh), correct.

So dV/dt = -A v = -A sqrt(2g h). Since V=π r² h, dV/dt = π r² dh/dt.

So π r² dh/dt = -A sqrt(2g h).

Solving for dt: dt = - (π r²)/(A sqrt(2g)) ) * (1/sqrt(h)) dh.

Integrate from h=4 (full) to h=0 (empty). So:

T = ∫ dt from 4 to 0 = ∫ (π r²)/(A sqrt(2g)) ) * (1/sqrt(h)) dh from 4 to 0.

Which is (π r²)/(A sqrt(2g)) ) * ∫ (1/sqrt(h)) dh from 4 to 0.

Wait, no, because when h goes from 4 to 0, the integral becomes from 4 to 0, and the negative sign would flip it to 0 to4, so T is positive.

Wait, let me write it correctly.

dh is negative as h decreases, so when we take the integral from h=4 to h=0, dh is negative. So:

T = integral from 4 to0 of [ (π r²) / (A sqrt(2g)) ) * (1/sqrt(h)) ] dh

But since dh is negative, the integral becomes:

T = (π r²)/(A sqrt(2g)) ) * integral from0 to4 (1/sqrt(h)) dh.

Because we switch the limits and remove the negative sign.

Wait, no, the integral of (1/sqrt(h)) dh from 4 to0 would be negative, but since we're finding the time, which is positive, it's better to switch the limits.

So, T = (π r²)/(A sqrt(2g)) ) * ∫ from0 to4 h^(-1/2) dh.

Which is (π r²)/(A sqrt(2g)) ) * [2 sqrt(h)] from0 to4.

So that's (π r²)/(A sqrt(2g)) ) * (2*sqrt(4) - 0) = (π r² * 4 )/(A sqrt(2g)) ).

Wait, because 2*sqrt(4) is 4.

So, plugging in the numbers:

r=1 m, so r²=1.

So T = (π *1 *4 )/(0.0004 * sqrt(2 *9.81)) )

Wait, sqrt(2*9.81)=sqrt(19.62)=4.42948.

So denominator is 0.0004 *4.42948=0.00177179.

So T= (4 π ) / 0.00177179.

Compute 4 *3.14159265=12.56637.

12.56637 /0.00177179 ≈7095.63 seconds.

So approximately 7,095.63 seconds.

Looking at the options, the closest is F:7142, but that's 7142.

Wait, am I missing something here? Let me check the calculation once again.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the radius of the tank is 1m, which I included as r²=1. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the hole's area is incorrect? Wait, no, the hole is a square of side 2 cm, which is 0.02 m. So area is 0.02^2 = 0.0004 m². Correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the time using a different approach, perhaps using the formula for the draining time of a tank.

The general formula for time to drain a cylindrical tank is T = (π r²)/(A sqrt(2g)) ) * (2 sqrt(2H)) ), but I might be mixing terms.

Wait, another approach: The time to drain is given by T = (π r²)/(A sqrt(2g)) ) * 2 sqrt(H), where H is the initial height.

Wait, no, because when we integrate 1/sqrt(h) from 0 to H, we get 2 sqrt(H).

So the formula is correct as I used before.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

So let me compute 4 * π =12.566370614.

Denominator: 0.0004 * sqrt(2*9.81)=0.0004 * 4.429484848= 0.00177179394.

So 12.566370614 / 0.00177179394 = ?

Let me compute this division.

Using a calculator:

12.566370614 ÷ 0.00177179394 ≈ 7095.64 seconds.

Hmm, but the options don't have 7095. The closest is F:7142, which is 7142 seconds.

Wait, could there be a miscalculation in the area? Let me check again.

Wait, the hole is a square with side 2 cm. So area is (0.02 m)^2 =0.0004 m². Correct.

Wait, maybe the initial approach is wrong because the hole is square, so perhaps the coefficient is different? Wait, Torricelli's law assumes a small hole, and the coefficient of discharge is around 0.61, but I think I neglected that. Oh wait, in the problem statement, it's probably assuming the ideal case without considering the coefficient, so using v = sqrt(2gh) directly. But sometimes, the formula includes a 0.61 factor. Let me think.

If that's the case, then the velocity would be 0.61 * sqrt(2gh).

In that case, the flow rate would be A * 0.61 * sqrt(2gh).

So, I might have missed the 0.61 factor.

Wait, but the problem statement doesn't mention anything about the coefficient of discharge. So perhaps I should not include it. Hmm. Because in the question, it says "water drains through a square hole", implying that we should use the actual flow, but I'm not sure if Torricelli's law includes it.

Wait, let me think: Torricelli's law is v = sqrt(2gh), but the actual velocity is about 0.98 times that for a sharp-edged hole, and less for rounded ones. But often, in problems like this, they assume the ideal case without the coefficient, so v= sqrt(2gh).

So I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, but let's see what happens if I include the coefficient of discharge, say C_d=0.61.

In that case, the velocity v= C_d * sqrt(2gh).

So the flow rate dV/dt = A * C_d * sqrt(2gh).

In that case, the time would be longer, because the flow rate is less.

So, with C_d=0.61, the time T would be (π r²)/(A C_d sqrt(2g)) ) * 2 sqrt(H).

So, let's compute that.

A=0.0004 m², C_d=0.61.

Denominator becomes 0.0004 *0.61 * sqrt(2*
