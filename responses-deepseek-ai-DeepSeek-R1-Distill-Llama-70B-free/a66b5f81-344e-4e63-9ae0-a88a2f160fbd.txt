Okay, so I have this question about Kant's moral philosophy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question is asking about what the moral worth of an action depends on according to Kant. The options are A, B, C, or D. Let me break down what I remember.

Kant... right, Immanuel Kant. He was a deontologist, which means he focused on duties and rules rather than consequences. I remember he talked a lot about the categorical imperative. So, his theory is more about the rightness or wrongness of actions themselves, not the outcomes.

Wait, so in Kant's view, the moral worth of an action isn't based on the consequences. So that would eliminate option B because that's about consequences. So B is probably not the right answer. 

Now, the other options. Option A says the moral character of the agent. Hmm. I think Kant did say something about the intention behind the action. Like, if someone does the right thing but for the wrong reason, does that affect the moral worth? Wait, no, I think he said that the moral worth is based on the motive. So if you do something because it's your duty, that's what gives it moral worth. So maybe the agent's moral character is involved, but I'm not sure if that's exactly what he meant. Or was it more about the maxim they act upon?

Oh right, the maxim. I think Kant talked about maxims being the personal policies or rules that guide a person's actions. So when someone acts, they follow a maxim, and the moral worth depends on whether that maxim can be willed as a universal law. So the action's moral worth is based on the maxim it's based on. So option C says the maxim that is acted on. That sounds correct.

Wait, but what about option A? The moral character of the agent. Does that factor in? Or is it more about the specific action's maxim? I think Kant focused more on the maxim and whether it aligns with the categorical imperative rather than the overall character of the person. Like, a person might have good character but make a mistake, or vice versa. So the moral worth is about the particular action's maxim.

So putting it together, the moral worth depends on the maxim (option C). So the answer should be C. 

But wait, the options include D, which is all of the above. Could it be that all of them are factors? I don't think so. Because Kant was pretty clear that consequences don't matter, so B is out. And I don't think he based it on the agent's overall character but on the specific maxim of the action. So D is out, and A might not be the main point. So the answer is C.

According to Kant, the moral worth of an action depends on the maxim that is acted on. Kant's deontological approach emphasizes that the moral worth of an action is determined by whether the maxim (or rule) guiding the action can be willed as a universal law, as per the categorical imperative. This focus on the maxim eliminates option B, as consequences are irrelevant in Kant's view. While the moral character of the agent (option A) might be related, Kant specifically ties moral worth to the maxim itself, not the agent's overall character. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C: the maxim that is acted on.

Answer: C
