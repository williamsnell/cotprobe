Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about why there's been a relative shift away from farming. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the options A to G is correct. Let me think through each option one by one.

First, the question is asking for reasons why people have moved away from farming. I remember that historically, a lot of people used to work in agriculture, but nowadays, more are moving to cities. So, maybe it's about better opportunities elsewhere.

Option A says it's because automated systems made traditional farming obsolete. That makes some sense because technology has definitely changed farming. But wait, automation might make farming more efficient, but does it make it obsolete? Maybe not entirely. Plus, some people still work in farming, just with machines now. So maybe A isn't the main reason.

Option B is about diseases making farming impossible. I don't think there's been a global disease outbreak that's wiped out farming. Maybe specific regions have issues, but not a widespread shift. So B might not be the right answer.

Option C suggests a shift towards synthetic foods. I'm not sure how big synthetic foods are yet. Maybe in some places, but is that a major reason for moving away from farming? I'm not certain. It feels a bit niche, so maybe not the primary cause.

Option D says there's a global decrease in demand for agricultural products. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the population is growing, so demand for food should increase, not decrease. Unless it's about specific products, but overall, I don't think D is correct.

Option E states that people are moving to cities for higher incomes, shorter hours, and better social lives. That rings a bell. I remember something about urbanization and people moving to cities for better jobs and living conditions. Cities often offer more opportunities, higher wages, and more amenities. So E seems plausible.

Option F is government policies against farming. I'm not sure about that. Some policies might affect farming, like subsidies or trade regulations, but I don't think they're the main reason people leave farming. Plus, many governments support agriculture, so F might not be right.

Option G talks about depletion of non-renewable farming resources. Wait, farming resources like fertilizers or fuels? Some are non-renewable, but I'm not sure if their depletion is a major driver. Maybe in some areas, but globally, I'm not certain this is the main cause.

So, putting it all together, the most likely reason is E: people moving to cities for better income, shorter hours, and a better social life. That aligns with what I know about urbanization trends and the attraction of city life over rural farming.

The shift away from farming is primarily driven by the allure of urban opportunities. People are drawn to cities for higher incomes, shorter working hours, and an improved social life. This aligns with urbanization trends where cities offer better job prospects and amenities compared to rural farming. 

Answer: E
