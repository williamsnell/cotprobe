Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the moment of inertia of a thin rod. Hmm, I remember that the moment of inertia depends on the mass distribution relative to the axis of rotation. The question says the rod is pivoted about one end. Right, so it's rotating around that end point.

Wait, I think the formula for the moment of inertia varies based on where the axis is. Let me recall. For a thin rod, when it's rotating about its center, the moment of inertia is (1/12)ml². But that's when the axis is through the center, right?

But in this case, the pivot is at one end. Oh right, there's another formula for that. I think it's (1/3)ml². How does that come about?

Oh yeah, I remember something about integrating along the length. If the rod is pivoted at one end, each infinitesimal mass element contributes based on its distance from the pivot. The formula is the integral from 0 to l of r² dm. Since dm is (m/l) dr, the integral becomes (m/l) ∫ r² dr from 0 to l.

Calculating that integral: (m/l) [ (r³)/3 ] from 0 to l. So that's (m/l)(l³/3 - 0) = (m l²)/3. So the moment of inertia is (1/3)ml². 

Looking at the options, option A is 1/3 m l squared. So the answer should be A.

The moment of inertia of a thin rod pivoted about one end is calculated by considering the distribution of mass relative to the axis of rotation. For a rod of length $l$ and mass $m$, the moment of inertia is derived using the integral:

\[
I = \int_0^l r^2 \, dm
\]

Here, $dm$ is expressed as $\frac{m}{l} dr$, where $dr$ is a small segment of the rod's length. Substituting this into the integral gives:

\[
I = \frac{m}{l} \int_0^l r^2 \, dr
\]

Evaluating the integral:

\[
I = \frac{m}{l} \left[ \frac{r^3}{3} \right]_0^l = \frac{m}{l} \cdot \frac{l^3}{3} = \frac{1}{3} m l^2
\]

Thus, the moment of inertia for a thin rod pivoted about one end is $\frac{1}{3} m l^2$. Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

A: $\frac{1}{3} m l^2$
