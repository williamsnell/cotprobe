Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two lenses, A and B. They have equal focal lengths, but lens A has twice the diameter of lens B. The question has three parts: a, b, and c. I need to figure out each of these.

Let me start by recalling what I know about lenses and light. I remember that the amount of light a lens can collect relates to its area. The bigger the diameter, the larger the area. Oh wait, the area of a lens is based on the formula for the area of a circle, which is πr². Since the diameter is twice as big for lens A, the radius would be twice as much too. So the radius of A is 2r and B is r.

Calculating the areas: For A, it's π(2r)² = π4r². For B, it's πr². So the ratio of the areas (A to B) is 4:1. Since energy collected is proportional to the area, part (a) should have a ratio of 4:1. Wait, let me make sure. Energy collected is about how much light is gathered, which depends on the aperture area. So yes, part (a) is 4:1.

Now part (b) is about the ratio of the areas of the diffraction patterns. Hmm, I think diffraction patterns are related to the wavelength and the aperture size. The formula for the diffraction angle comes into play here. The angle θ is approximately λ/(d), where d is the diameter of the aperture. Wait, or is it the radius? No, I think it's the diameter. So the central maximum in a diffraction pattern is about λ/D, where D is the diameter.

Wait, if the diameter is larger, the angle θ is smaller. So lens A has a larger diameter, thus a smaller diffraction angle. That would make the diffraction pattern for A smaller in size compared to B. But wait, the question is about the area of the diffraction patterns. So if the angle is smaller, the pattern would be smaller in size. How does the area relate to the angle?

The area of the diffraction pattern would depend on the solid angle, I guess. But I'm a bit fuzzy here. Alternatively, perhaps the area is proportional to the square of the diameter of the pattern. Let me think. The central maximum's diameter in the diffraction pattern is proportional to λ * (distance to screen) / D. So if the screen is at a fixed distance, then the size of the pattern is inversely proportional to D. So if A has D=2d, the pattern diameter would be half as much as B. So the area would be (d_A)^2, and for B, it's (d_B)^2. So d_A is d_B/2. Then area of A is (d_B/2)^2 = (1/4)d_B². So the area of A's pattern is 1/4 that of B. So the ratio of areas (A to B) is 1:4. So part (b) is 1:4.

Wait, but wait another thought: the problem states that both lenses have the same focal length. Oh, wait, the distance to the focal point (the screen where the image forms) is the same for both, since the focal length is the same. Because focal length f is the distance from the lens to the image when the object is at infinity, right? So if f is the same for both, then the distance to the screen is the same. So that means the diameter of the diffraction pattern is inversely proportional to the diameter of the lens. So for lens A, with D=2D_B, the pattern diameter would be (λ f)/(D_A). So since D_A is 2 D_B, the pattern diameter is (λ f)/(2 D_B) = (1/2)(λ f/D_B), which is half of what it would be for B. So the area would be proportional to (diameter)^2. So area for A is (1/2)^2 = 1/4 of B's area. So the ratio is 1:4. So part (b) is 1:4.

Now part (c): the ratio of energy per unit area in the two patterns. From part (a), the energy collected by A is 4 times that of B. From part (b), the area of A's pattern is 1/4 that of B. So energy per unit area would be (energy)/(area). 

So for A: (4 E_B) / ( (1/4) A_B ) = 4/(1/4) * (E_B / A_B) ) = 16 (E_B/A_B).

Wait, let me think again. Let me denote E as the energy. So E_A = 4 E_B. The area of the pattern for A is (1/4) A_B. So energy per unit area for A is E_A / A_A = (4 E_B) / ( (1/4) A_B ) ) = 4 *4 * (E_B / A_B) ) = 16 (E_B/A_B). 

Energy per unit area for B is E_B / A_B. So the ratio of A to B is 16:1.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should compute (E_A / A_A) / (E_B / A_B) ) = (E_A / E_B) * (A_B / A_A). We know E_A/E_B is 4:1, and A_B/A_A is 4:1 (since A_A is 1/4 A_B). So that would be 4 *4 = 16. So yes, the ratio is 16:1.

So putting it all together:

(a) 4:1

(b) 1:4

(c) 16:1

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option E is 4:1, 1:4, 16:1. That's exactly what I got.

So the correct answer is option E.

To solve the problem, we analyze the relationship between the lenses and their diffraction patterns based on the given information:

1. **Energy Collected (Part a):**  
   The energy collected by a lens is proportional to its aperture area. The area of a lens is given by \( A = \pi D^2 / 4 \), where \( D \) is the diameter. Since lens A has twice the diameter of lens B (\( D_A = 2D_B \)), the area of lens A is \( \pi (2D_B)^2 / 4 = 4 \pi D_B^2 / 4 \), which is 4 times the area of lens B. Therefore, the ratio of energy collected by lens A to lens B is **4:1**.

2. **Area of Diffraction Patterns (Part b):**  
   The size of the diffraction pattern is inversely proportional to the diameter of the lens. The central maximum's diameter in the diffraction pattern is proportional to \( \lambda f / D \), where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength, \( f \) is the focal length, and \( D \) is the lens diameter. Since both lenses have the same focal length, the diameter of the diffraction pattern for lens A is half that of lens B. The area of the diffraction pattern is proportional to the square of its diameter, so the area for lens A is \( (1/2)^2 = 1/4 \) of that for lens B. Thus, the ratio of the areas of the diffraction patterns (A to B) is **1:4**.

3. **Energy per Unit Area (Part c):**  
   The energy per unit area in the diffraction pattern is given by the total energy collected divided by the area of the pattern. From part (a), lens A collects 4 times the energy of lens B (\( E_A = 4E_B \)). From part (b), the area of lens A's diffraction pattern is \( 1/4 \) that of lens B (\( A_A = A_B / 4 \)). Therefore, the energy per unit area for lens A is:  
   \[
   \frac{E_A}{A_A} = \frac{4E_B}{A_B / 4} = 16 \frac{E_B}{A_B}.
   \]  
   The ratio of energy per unit area (A to B) is **16:1**.

### Final Answer:
(a) 4:1, (b) 1:4, (c) 16:1.  
The correct option is **E**.
