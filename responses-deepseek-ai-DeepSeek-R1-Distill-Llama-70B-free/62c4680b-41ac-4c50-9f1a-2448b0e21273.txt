Okay, so I've got this FM modulation problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that an FM signal ranges from f_max = 100.02 MHz to f_min = 99.98 MHz. It's modulated by a 3 kHz sine wave. There are four parts to the question: finding the carrier frequency, carrier swing, frequency deviation, and the modulation index. The options are from A to J, each giving different values for these parameters.

First, I need to remember what each of these terms means. Let me jot down the key concepts.

1. **Carrier Frequency (f_c):** This is the center frequency of the FM signal when there's no modulation. In other words, it's the average of the maximum and minimum frequencies of the modulated signal. So I can calculate it by taking the average of f_max and f_min.

2. **Frequency Deviation (Δf):** This is the maximum change in the carrier frequency due to the modulating signal. It's the difference between either f_max or f_min and the carrier frequency. So, Δf = f_max - f_c or f_c - f_min. Alternatively, since f_max = f_c + Δf and f_min = f_c - Δf, the deviation is the same in both cases.

3. **Carrier Swing:** This is the total range of frequency variation, which is the difference between f_max and f_min. So, swing = f_max - f_min. Alternatively, it's twice the frequency deviation because it's the peak-to-peak variation.

4. **Modulation Index (β):** This is the ratio of the frequency deviation to the modulating frequency. So, β = Δf / f_m, where f_m is the frequency of the modulating signal, which in this case is 3 kHz.

Now, let's compute each part step by step.

**Part A: Carrier Frequency (f_c)**
f_c should be the average of f_max and f_min. So,

f_c = (f_max + f_min) / 2
f_max is 100.02 MHz, f_min is 99.98 MHz.

Adding them: 100.02 + 99.98 = 200 MHz. Dividing by 2 gives 100 MHz. So f_c is 100 MHz.

Looking at the options, all except A, E, G, I, J have f_c as 100 MHz. So A, E, G, I, J can be considered for f_c, but others have it correct. So I'll keep that in mind.

**Part B: Carrier Swing**
Carrier swing is the difference between f_max and f_min. So,

Swing = f_max - f_min = 100.02 MHz - 99.98 MHz = 0.04 MHz. Wait, 0.04 MHz is 40 kHz. Because 1 MHz = 1000 kHz, so 0.04 MHz is 40 kHz.

So the carrier swing is 40 kHz.

Looking through the options, which ones have carrier swing as 40 kHz? Looking at each option:

Option F: swing=40 kHz. So that's a possibility.

Other options:

Option B: swing=44 kHz, no.

Option C: 70 kHz, no.

Option D: 20, no.

Option E: 80, no.

Option F: yes.

Option H: 100, no.

So option F has the right swing.

Wait, wait. Wait another thing. Oh, I might have made a mistake. Let me think again. Oh, wait, f_max is 100.02, f_min is 99.98. So the difference is 0.04 MHz, which is 40 kHz. So swing is 40 kHz. So in the options, only option F and option B has 44? Let me check.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option F says carrier swing=40 kHz. Yes.

So that's correct.

So part B is 40 kHz.

**Part C: Frequency Deviation (Δf)**

Frequency deviation is the maximum shift from the carrier. Since f_max = f_c + Δf, and f_min = f_c - Δf, the deviation is (f_max - f_c) or (f_c - f_min). Let me compute that.

f_c is 100 MHz.

So, f_max - f_c = 100.02 - 100 = 0.02 MHz = 20 kHz.

So Δf is 20 kHz.

Looking at the options:

Option F says Δf is 20 kHz. Correct.

So part C is correct in option F.

**Part D: Modulation Index (β)**

β is Δf divided by the modulating frequency f_m.

Given that the modulating signal is 3 kHz, so:

β = Δf / f_m = 20 kHz / 3 kHz = approximately 6.666..., which is 6.667 when rounded to three decimal places.

So β is approximately 6.667.

Looking at the options, option F has modulation index 6.667. So that's correct.

So putting it all together:

A: f_c =100 MHz.

B: swing=40 kHz.

C: Δf=20 kHz.

D: β=6.667.

Looking at the options, option F matches all these values.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other options. Let's check option F:

F: f_c=100 MHz, carrier swing=40 kHz, frequency deviation=20 kHz, modulation index=6.667. Yep, that's exactly what I calculated.

So the correct answer is option F.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given parameters of the FM signal and compute the required values step by step:

1. **Carrier Frequency ($f_c$):**  
   The carrier frequency is the average of the maximum and minimum frequencies of the modulated signal:  
   \[
   f_c = \frac{f_{\text{max}} + f_{\text{min}}}{2}
   \]  
   Substituting the given values:  
   \[
   f_c = \frac{100.02 \, \text{MHz} + 99.98 \, \text{MHz}}{2} = 100 \, \text{MHz}
   \]  
   Thus, the carrier frequency is **100 MHz**.

2. **Carrier Swing:**  
   The carrier swing is the total range of frequency variation, calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Swing} = f_{\text{max}} - f_{\text{min}}
   \]  
   Substituting the given values:  
   \[
   \text{Swing} = 100.02 \, \text{MHz} - 99.98 \, \text{MHz} = 0.04 \, \text{MHz} = 40 \, \text{kHz}
   \]  
   Thus, the carrier swing is **40 kHz**.

3. **Frequency Deviation ($\Delta f$):**  
   The frequency deviation is the maximum shift in the carrier frequency due to modulation. It is calculated as:  
   \[
   \Delta f = f_{\text{max}} - f_c \quad \text{or} \quad \Delta f = f_c - f_{\text{min}}
   \]  
   Using $f_{\text{max}} - f_c$:  
   \[
   \Delta f = 100.02 \, \text{MHz} - 100 \, \text{MHz} = 0.02 \, \text{MHz} = 20 \, \text{kHz}
   \]  
   Thus, the frequency deviation is **20 kHz**.

4. **Modulation Index ($\beta$):**  
   The modulation index is the ratio of the frequency deviation to the modulating frequency ($f_m$):  
   \[
   \beta = \frac{\Delta f}{f_m}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \beta = \frac{20 \, \text{kHz}}{3 \, \text{kHz}} \approx 6.667
   \]  
   Thus, the modulation index is approximately **6.667**.

Finally, comparing the computed values with the options provided, the correct answer is:  
**Option F: $f_c = 100 \, \text{MHz}$, carrier swing = $40 \, \text{kHz}$, frequency deviation = $20 \, \text{kHz}$, modulation index = $6.667$.**
