Okay, so I've got this question about photosynthesis, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see... The question is asking which of the given options is the source of oxygen produced during photosynthesis. Hmm, I remember that photosynthesis involves plants making their own food, right? From what I learned, the basic equation is something like carbon dioxide and water converting into glucose and oxygen using sunlight.

Wait, so the equation is 6 CO2 + 6 H2O → C6H12O6 + 6 O2. Right, so the products are glucose and oxygen. But where does the oxygen come from? I think the oxygen released is from the water molecules. Because when I look at the equation, the O2 is on the product side, and the reactants include H2O. So the water is being split somehow, and the oxygen is released.

Let me think about the process. Oh, right, in the light-dependent reactions, water is split into hydrogen ions and oxygen. That's called photolysis, I think. So each water molecule contributes the oxygen that's released as O2. So the oxygen in the atmosphere from photosynthesis comes from water, not carbon dioxide.

Looking at the options, the choices are A through J. The options are: A is O2, B is methane, C is CO2, D is H2O, E is N2, F is glucose, G is H2O2, H is ozone, I is CO, J is carbon.

So the question is the source of the oxygen produced. The answer should be D: H2O, because water is where the oxygen comes from.

Wait, but could I be mixing this up with something else? Let me double-check. Oh yeah, I remember that the oxygen in CO2 is not the same as the O2 released. Plants take in CO2 and release O2, but the O2 comes from splitting H2O. So the source is definitely water.

So the correct answer is D.

The oxygen produced during photosynthesis comes from the splitting of water molecules (H₂O) in the light-dependent reactions. This process, called photolysis, releases oxygen as a byproduct. While carbon dioxide (CO₂) is a reactant in photosynthesis, the oxygen released does not originate from it but from water. Therefore, the correct source of oxygen is water (H₂O).

Answer: D
