Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the correct answer is for this multiple-choice question about what an attitude is. Let me break it down.

The question asks, "What is an attitude?" and gives options from A to J. I'm a bit rusty on psychology terms, but I remember that attitudes are related to how people feel about things. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says, "a learned skill that improves with practice." Hmm, that sounds more like a skill or ability, like playing an instrument. Attitudes aren't really skills, so I don't think this is right.

Option B: "a definitive decision made based on facts." No, that sounds more like a judgment or conclusion. Attitudes are more about feelings than decisions based on facts.

Option C: "an emotional state that varies frequently." Wait, emotional states can change a lot, like moods. But I think attitudes are more stable than that. So maybe not C.

Option D: "a set of behaviors that are consistent across different situations." Behaviors are actions, right? Attitudes are more about feelings and thoughts, not just the actions themselves. So probably not D.

Option E: "a moral judgment that defines right or wrong actions." That feels more like a value or ethic, not an attitude. Attitudes are about liking or disliking something, not necessarily about morality.

Option F: "a relatively stable and enduring tendency to react positively or negatively to a particular person, object, situation, or event." This rings a bell. I remember that attitudes are lasting and influence how we react. So F seems like a strong candidate.

Option G: "a cognitive ability to solve complex problems." That's more about intelligence or problem-solving skills, not attitudes.

Option H: "a temporary reaction to a situation." That sounds like a mood or a fleeting emotion, not an attitude which is more stable.

Option I: "a biological impulse triggered by environmental factors." Impulses are immediate reactions, often without much thought. Attitudes involve some level of evaluation, so I don't think this is it.

Option J: "a physical response to a stimulus." That's more like a reflex or physiological reaction, not an attitude.

Putting it all together, the best fit seems to be Option F. It describes an attitude as a stable tendency to react in certain ways, which matches what I remember about attitudes being enduring and influencing reactions.

The correct answer is F, as it accurately describes an attitude as a relatively stable and enduring tendency to react positively or negatively toward specific stimuli.

Answer: F
