Okay, so I've got this math problem here about determining the number of men needed to build a boat in a certain number of days. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that it takes 36 men 132 days to build one boat. Now, they're asking how many men are needed to build the same boat in 77 days instead. Hmm, I think this is a work-rate problem. I remember that work problems often involve the idea that more workers can finish a job faster, assuming each worker contributes equally.

So, the basic idea here is probably to set up a proportion based on man-days. Man-days is like the total amount of work done, calculated by the number of men multiplied by the number of days they work. If the total work required to build the boat is the same in both cases, then the product of men and days should remain constant.

Let me write this down. The original setup is 36 men working for 132 days. So the total work, in man-days, is 36 * 132. Let me calculate that. 36 times 100 is 3600, 36 times 32 is 1152, so 3600 + 1152 equals 4752 man-days. So the boat requires 4752 man-days of work.

Now, the new situation is that we need the boat built in 77 days. Let me call the number of men needed in this case M. So the total work here would be M * 77 man-days. Since the total work needed is the same (4752), I can set up the equation M * 77 = 4752.

To find M, I divide both sides by 77. So M = 4752 / 77. Let me compute that. Hmm, 77 times 60 is 4620. 4752 minus 4620 is 132. 77 goes into 132 once, because 77*1 is 77, and 77*2 is 154 which is too much. Wait, wait, 77 times 1 is 77, so 132 minus 77 is 55. Hmm, wait, maybe I should do this differently. Maybe 77 times 61 is 77*60 +77 = 4620 +77=4697. 4752 -4697 is 55. Then 77 goes into 55 about 0.71 times. So that's approximately 61.71. But that gives me a fractional man, which doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a person.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try a different approach. Let's compute 4752 divided by 77. 

77 * 60 = 4620. Subtract that from 4752: 4752 -4620=132. Now, 77 * 1 =77. Subtract again:132-77=55. So 60 +1 =61, with a remainder of 55. So 55/77 is 5/7 ≈0.714. So M≈61.714. But we can't have a fraction of a man, so we'd have to round up to the next whole number, which is 62. 

Looking at the options, option G is 62 men. So the answer should be G:62 men.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Another way to compute 4752/77 is to see how many times 77 fits into 4752.

Alternatively, perhaps using division step by step:

77 | 4752

77 *60=4620, as before. Subtract, get 132. Then 77 goes into 132 once (77*1=77), subtract to get 55. Bring down a zero, making it 550. 77*7=539, so 7 fits into 550 seven times (539). 550-539=11. Bring down another zero, making it 110. 77*1=77, subtract to get 33. So so far, it's 61.71... So yeah, 61.714...

So M is approximately 61.71, so 62 men when rounded up because you can't have a fraction. So G is 62, which is the correct answer.

To determine the number of men needed to build the boat in 77 days, we start by calculating the total work required, which is constant in both scenarios. The original setup involves 36 men working for 132 days, so the total work in man-days is:

\[
36 \times 132 = 4752 \, \text{man-days}.
\]

In the new scenario, we need the same amount of work to be completed in 77 days. Let \( M \) represent the number of men required. The total work can also be expressed as:

\[
M \times 77 = 4752 \, \text{man-days}.
\]

To find \( M \), we divide both sides by 77:

\[
M = \frac{4752}{77}.
\]

Performing the division:

\[
77 \times 61 = 4697, \quad 4752 - 4697 = 55.
\]

This gives:

\[
M = 61 + \frac{55}{77} \approx 61.714.
\]

Since the number of men must be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, which is 62. Therefore, the number of men needed is:

**G: 62 men.**
