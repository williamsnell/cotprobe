Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the interest charge on a $600 loan at 6% for 60 days, and then figure out the total amount due. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that interest can be calculated in different ways, like simple interest or compound interest. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume it's simple interest because that's more common for short-term loans like 60 days.

The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where:
- I is the interest,
- P is the principal amount (the initial amount borrowed),
- r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form),
- t is the time in years.

Wait, but the time here is 60 days, not years. So I need to convert that into a fraction of a year. Since there are 365 days in a year, 60 days would be 60/365 years. Let me calculate that. 60 divided by 365 is approximately 0.1644 years.

Now, plugging in the numbers:
P is $600, r is 6%, which is 0.06 in decimal, and t is approximately 0.1644.

So the interest I would be 600 * 0.06 * 0.1644. Let me compute that step by step.

First, 600 * 0.06 is 36. Then, 36 multiplied by 0.1644. Let me do that multiplication. 36 * 0.1644... Well, 36 * 0.1 is 3.6, 36 * 0.06 is 2.16, 36 * 0.0044 is about 0.1584. Adding those together: 3.6 + 2.16 is 5.76, plus 0.1584 gives approximately 5.9184. So the interest is about $5.92.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that calculation because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 600 * 0.06 first, which is definitely 36. Then 36 multiplied by (60/365). Let me calculate 60/365 exactly. 60 รท 365 equals approximately 0.16438356.

So 36 * 0.16438356. Let me compute that more accurately. 36 times 0.1 is 3.6, 36 times 0.06 is 2.16, 36 times 0.00438356 is... Let's see, 36 * 0.004 is 0.144, and 36 * 0.00038356 is about 0.013829. So adding all together: 3.6 + 2.16 is 5.76, plus 0.144 is 5.904, plus 0.013829 gives around 5.9178, so approximately $5.92. So the interest is about $5.92.

Wait, but another approach: 6% annual interest means the daily interest rate is 6% divided by 365. So 0.06 / 365 = 0.00016438 per day. Then, for 60 days, the interest would be 600 * 0.00016438 * 60.

Calculating that: 600 * 0.00016438 is 0.098628. Then multiply by 60: 0.098628 * 60 = approximately 5.91768, so again about $5.92. So that seems consistent.

So the interest is approximately $5.92. Now, the total amount due would be the principal plus the interest, so $600 + $5.92 = $605.92.

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, the options are in whole dollars or specific amounts. Let me check the options again:

Options are:
A: $612
B: $600
C: $620
D: $624
E: $606
F: $615
G: $610
H: $602
I: $630
J: $618

Hmm, $605.92 is approximately $606, which is option E. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because the options don't have $605.92, but option E is $606, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the interest.

Wait, maybe the interest is calculated differently. Another way is to use the formula for simple interest as (P * r * t)/100, but I think I already did that.

Wait, 6% of $600 is indeed 36 dollars per year. For 60 days, which is 60/365 of a year, so 36 * (60/365).

Calculating 36 * 60 = 2160. Then 2160 divided by 365. Let's compute that: 365 ร 5 is 1825. 2160 - 1825 is 335. So 5 with a remainder. 335 / 365 is approximately 0.9178. So total is 5.9178, which is about $5.92.

So the total amount due is $600 + $5.92 = $605.92, which is $606 when rounded to the nearest dollar. So the correct answer would be E: $606.

Wait, but wait another moment. Did the problem specify whether it's 60 days exactly, and if the interest is calculated on a 360-day year or 365-day year? Oh, because sometimes in some financial calculations, people use 360 days for simplicity, especially in business contexts. So perhaps I should check that.

If using a 360-day year, then 60 days would be 60/360 = 1/6 of a year, which is approximately 0.1666667.

So let's recalculate with 60/360 = 1/6.

Then I = 600 * 0.06 * (1/6) = 600 * 0.01 = $6.00.

So the interest would be $6.00, making the total amount $606. So that's exactly $606, matching option E.

Wait, so the initial calculation using 365 days gave me approximately $5.92, which rounds to $6, making the total $606. Alternatively, using 360 days gives exactly $6, so total is $606.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: $606.

To calculate the interest charge on a $600 loan at 6% for 60 days and determine the total amount due, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot r \cdot t
\]

Where:
- \( P = \$600 \) (principal amount),
- \( r = 0.06 \) (annual interest rate in decimal),
- \( t = \frac{60}{365} \) (time in years, assuming a 365-day year).

First, calculate the time in years:
\[
t = \frac{60}{365} \approx 0.1644
\]

Now, calculate the interest:
\[
I = 600 \cdot 0.06 \cdot 0.1644 \approx 5.92
\]

The total amount due is the sum of the principal and the interest:
\[
\text{Total Amount} = 600 + 5.92 = 605.92
\]

Rounding to the nearest dollar, the total amount due is approximately \$606.

If using a 360-day year for simplicity (as is common in some financial calculations), the time in years would be:
\[
t = \frac{60}{360} = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.1667
\]

Recalculating the interest:
\[
I = 600 \cdot 0.06 \cdot 0.1667 = 6.00
\]

The total amount due would then be:
\[
\text{Total Amount} = 600 + 6 = 606
\]

In both cases, the total amount due is \$606. Comparing this to the answer choices, the correct answer is:

**E: $606**
