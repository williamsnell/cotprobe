Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to calculate the interest rate for an account. Let's see, the account started with $5,000 and now has $13,000 after being compounded annually for 12 years. My goal is to find the interest rate, which will be a decimal between 0 and 1. The options given are A through J, each with different numeric values.

Hmm, I remember that compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r)^t, where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the annual interest rate, and t is the time in years. So I can plug in the values I have into this formula.

Wait, let me make sure I have the right formula. Oh right, the formula for compound interest is indeed A equals P times (1 plus r) raised to the power of t. So I can rearrange this formula to solve for r since that's what I'm looking for.

So plugging in the numbers, A is $13,000, P is $5,000, and t is 12 years. Let's write that out:

13,000 = 5,000 * (1 + r)^12.

I think I can simplify this by dividing both sides by 5,000. That should make it easier to solve for r. So dividing both sides by 5,000 gives me:

13,000 / 5,000 = (1 + r)^12.

Calculating the left side, 13,000 divided by 5,000 is 2.6. So now the equation is:

2.6 = (1 + r)^12.

Now I need to solve for r. To get rid of the exponent, I can take the natural logarithm of both sides. Or maybe use the logarithm base 10, but natural log might be easier since I remember that ln(a^b) is b*ln(a).

Taking the natural log of both sides:

ln(2.6) = ln((1 + r)^12).

Which simplifies to:

ln(2.6) = 12 * ln(1 + r).

Now I can solve for ln(1 + r) by dividing both sides by 12.

ln(1 + r) = ln(2.6) / 12.

I think I can calculate ln(2.6) using a calculator. Let me recall that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931, and ln(3) is about 1.0986. But 2.6 is between e^0.9...? Wait, maybe better to just compute it directly. Alternatively, I can use approximate values or remember that ln(2) is about 0.693, ln(2.6) would be higher. Alternatively, if I don't have a calculator, perhaps I can make an educated guess.

Wait, but maybe I can approximate. Let me think, e^0.95 is approximately 2.586 because e^1 is about 2.718, and e^0.9 is about 2.4596. So e^0.95 is around 2.586, which is close to 2.6. So ln(2.6) would be approximately 0.9555. Let me check that: e^0.9555 = ?

Wait, not too sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute ln(2.6) as follows. Since 2.6 is 26/10, but that's not much help. Alternatively, using a calculator function, but since I'm doing this manually, maybe I can use a Taylor series or look for a known value. Alternatively, maybe I can use logarithm tables? Hmm, but perhaps I should proceed with an approximate value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the rule of 72 or some other rule, but that might not be precise enough. Alternatively, I can think in terms of the options provided. Since the options are given, maybe I can test each option to see which one gives A around 13,000 when plugged into the formula.

Wait, maybe that's a better approach. Because if I have 12 years and P is 5,000, then each option gives a rate r, so I can compute (1 + r)^12 and see if 5,000 times that equals approximately 13,000.

So the formula is 5000*(1 + r)^12 = 13000. So (1 + r)^12 = 2.6, as before.

So let's compute 2.6^(1/12) to find (1 + r).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, (1 + r) is the base, so 1 + r equals 2.6^(1/12). So r is (2.6)^(1/12) minus 1.

Alternatively, taking both sides to the 1/12 power:

1 + r = (2.6)^(1/12).

So r = (2.6)^(1/12) - 1.

Now, I can approximate (2.6)^(1/12). Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this using logarithms again.

Wait, (2.6)^(1/12) is equal to e^( (ln(2.6)) / 12 ). So earlier, I had ln(2.6) ≈ 0.9555 (if that's accurate), then 0.9555/12 ≈ 0.0796. Then e^0.0796 is approximately?

e^0.0796 is approximately 1.0828, because e^0.08 is about 1.0833. So 0.0796 would be slightly less, maybe around 1.0825.

So 1 + r is approximately 1.0825, so r is about 0.0825, which is 8.25%.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.0828, which is very close to this. So probably option F is the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure by perhaps calculating more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact value of (2.6)^(1/12) more accurately.

Another approach: Let's compute (1 + r)^12 = 2.6.

Take the 12th root of 2.6.

Alternatively, use logarithms to compute it.

Compute ln(2.6) = ?

Well, 2.6 is e^x. So x is ln(2.6).

Let me compute ln(2.6) accurately. Let's see, e^0.95 is approximately 2.586, as I thought earlier.

Because e^0.95:

We know that e^0.6931 = 2.

e^1 = 2.71828.

e^0.95: Let's compute it as approximately.

The Taylor expansion around x=1:

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator-like approach.

Wait, perhaps I should just proceed step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the natural logarithm of 2.6.

I can compute ln(2.6) using a calculator if I had one, but since I don't, perhaps I can use a known approximation.

Wait, I know that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931, ln(e)=1, and ln(3) is about 1.0986. 2.6 is between 2 and 3.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it as follows:

We can write 2.6 as 2 * 1.3, so ln(2.6) = ln(2) + ln(1.3).

I know that ln(1.3) is approximately 0.2624 because e^0.2624 ≈ 1.3.

So ln(2.6) ≈ 0.6931 + 0.2624 = 0.9555.

So that's where the 0.9555 comes from.

So ln(2.6) ≈ 0.9555.

Then, ln(2.6)/12 ≈ 0.9555 / 12 ≈ 0.079625.

So e^(0.079625) is approximately 1.0828.

Because e^0.079625 is e^0.07 is about 1.0725, e^0.08 is 1.0833. So 0.079625 is very close to 0.08, so e^0.079625 ≈ 1.0828.

So 1 + r ≈ 1.0828, so r ≈ 0.0828.

Looking back at the options, option F is 0.0828.

Therefore, the correct answer should be F.

But wait, I should double-check by plugging the value back into the formula.

Compute (1 + 0.0828)^12.

(1.0828)^12.

Let me compute this step by step.

Alternatively, using the rule of exponents, perhaps I can compute it approximately.

But perhaps it's easier to compute using the formula.

Compute 1.0828^12.

Alternatively, let's compute ln(1.0828) = 0.0797.

So (1.0828)^12 = e^(12 * 0.0797) = e^(0.9564) ≈ 2.6.

Which matches our original equation, so this checks out.

Thus, the interest rate is approximately 0.0828, which is option F.
</think>

To calculate the interest rate for the account, we use the compound interest formula:

\[
A = P(1 + r)^t
\]

where:
- \( A = 13,000 \) (the final amount),
- \( P = 5,000 \) (the principal),
- \( t = 12 \) (the time in years),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (to be determined).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( r \), we divide both sides by \( P \):

\[
\frac{A}{P} = (1 + r)^t
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{13,000}{5,000} = (1 + r)^{12}
\]

\[
2.6 = (1 + r)^{12}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2.6) = \ln((1 + r)^{12})
\]

Using the logarithmic identity \( \ln(a^b) = b\ln(a) \):

\[
\ln(2.6) = 12 \cdot \ln(1 + r)
\]

Solving for \( \ln(1 + r) \):

\[
\ln(1 + r) = \frac{\ln(2.6)}{12}
\]

Approximating \( \ln(2.6) \) as \( 0.9555 \):

\[
\ln(1 + r) = \frac{0.9555}{12} \approx 0.079625
\]

Exponentiating both sides to solve for \( 1 + r \):

\[
1 + r = e^{0.079625}
\]

Using \( e^{0.079625} \approx 1.0828 \):

\[
1 + r \approx 1.0828
\]

Thus:

\[
r \approx 1.0828 - 1 = 0.0828
\]

This matches option F, \( 0.0828 \). Verifying by substituting \( r = 0.0828 \) back into the original formula confirms that \( (1 + 0.0828)^{12} \approx 2.6 \), which aligns with the given values.
