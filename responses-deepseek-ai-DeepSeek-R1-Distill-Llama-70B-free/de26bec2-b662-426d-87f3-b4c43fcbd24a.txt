Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the percent markup based on the selling price. Hmm, let me read it again. A television sells for $180, and it costs the retailer $136.50. They want the percent markup based on the selling price. I'm a bit fuzzy on markup calculations, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, markup is the amount added to the cost to get the selling price, right? But sometimes people talk about markup as a percentage of cost or selling price. Oh right, the problem specifies "based on the selling price," so I need to calculate the markup relative to the selling price, not the cost.

So the formula for markup based on selling price would be: (Markup Amount / Selling Price) * 100 to get the percentage. 

First, I need to find the markup amount. That's the selling price minus the cost. Let me calculate that. Selling price is $180, cost is $136.50. So 180 minus 136.50 equals... let me do the subtraction. 180 minus 136 is 44, and then minus another 0.50 makes it 43.50. So the markup amount is $43.50.

Now, to find the markup percentage based on selling price, I take that $43.50 and divide by the selling price, which is $180. So 43.50 divided by 180. Hmm, let me do that division. 

43.50 ÷ 180. Well, 180 goes into 43.5 how many times? Let's see, 180 × 0.24 is 43.2 because 180 × 0.2 is 36, and 180 ×0.04 is 7.2, so 36+7.2=43.2. So 0.24 times 180 is 43.2. But we have 43.5, which is a bit more. The difference is 0.3. So 0.3 ÷ 180 is 0.001666... So adding that to 0.24 gives approximately 0.241666..., which is about 24.1666... percent. 

Looking at the options, option E is 24.17%, which matches my calculation.

Wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes it's easy to mix up cost and selling price as the base. The problem definitely says based on selling price, so yeah, that's correct. 

Another way to think about it: Markup = (Selling Price - Cost)/Cost *100 when based on cost. But since we're using selling price, it's (SP - C)/SP *100. So plugging in the numbers: (180-136.50)/180 = 43.50/180 = 0.241666..., which is 24.1666...%, so 24.17% when rounded to two decimal places.

To calculate the percent markup based on the selling price, the formula is:

\[
\text{Markup Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost}}{\text{Selling Price}} \right) \times 100
\]

Given:
- Selling Price = $180
- Cost = $136.50

First, calculate the markup amount:
\[
\text{Markup Amount} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost} = 180 - 136.50 = 43.50
\]

Next, divide the markup amount by the selling price:
\[
\frac{43.50}{180} = 0.241666\ldots
\]

Convert this to a percentage:
\[
0.241666 \times 100 = 24.1666\ldots\%
\]

Rounded to two decimal places, this is approximately **24.17%**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

E: 24.17%

Answer: E
