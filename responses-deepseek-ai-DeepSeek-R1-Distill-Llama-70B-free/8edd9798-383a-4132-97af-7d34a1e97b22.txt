Okay, so I've got this question about economics, specifically about the velocity of money. Hmm, I remember that velocity of money is a concept that relates to how often money is spent in the economy over a certain period. I think it's connected to the Gross National Product (GNP) and the money supply. 

Wait, the formula for velocity of money. I think it's Velocity = GNP / Money Supply. Oh right, because velocity tells us how many times the money supply is turned over in the economy during a year. So the formula makes sense because if you have a higher GNP with the same money supply, the velocity would be higher, meaning money is being used more times.

So the question gives me GNP as $600 billion and the money supply as $200 billion. I need to calculate the velocity. Using the formula, I plug in the numbers: 600 divided by 200. Let me do that math. 600 divided by 200 is 3. So the velocity is 3 times per year.

Looking at the options, option A is 3 times per year. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check the formula to make sure I didn't mix it up. Yes, velocity is GNP divided by M, the money supply. Yep, I think that's right. So I'm confident the answer is A.

The velocity of money is calculated using the formula: 

\[ \text{Velocity} = \frac{\text{GNP}}{\text{Money Supply}} \]

Given:
- GNP = $600 billion
- Money Supply = $200 billion

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{Velocity} = \frac{600}{200} = 3 \]

Thus, the velocity of money is 3 times per year. The correct answer is:

A: 3 times per year.
