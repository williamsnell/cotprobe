Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember everything perfectly, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says that air is expanded in a gas turbine. The initial conditions are 150 lbf/in², 150°F, and a velocity of 300 ft/sec. After expansion, it leaves at 50 lbf/in², 40°F, and 200 ft/sec. We need to find the reversible work per pound of air and the actual work done by the turbine. Oh wait, and it's assuming no heat losses and air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats. 

Hmm, okay. I think for turbines, we usually use the steady flow energy equation. The general energy equation for a control volume, right? The steady flow energy equation (SFEE) is probably the key here. 

The SFEE is: q - w = (h2 + (V2²)/2 + g z2) - (h1 + (V1²)/2 + g z1). But in this case, there's no heat transfer (q=0) and I think we can neglect potential energy changes (z terms are same or negligible), so the equation simplifies to -w = (h2 - h1) + (V2² - V1²)/2. Oh wait, but the work done by the turbine is positive, so probably I should write it as w = (h1 + V1²/2) - (h2 + V2²/2). But I'm a bit confused about the signs. Let me double-check.

Wait, the SFEE in the form: h1 + (V1²)/2 + g z1 + q = h2 + (V2²)/2 + g z2 + w. So rearranged, w = (h1 - h2) + (V1² - V2²)/2 + (g z1 - g z2). Since no heat and z is same, it's w = (h1 - h2) + (V1² - V2²)/2. 

But wait, the problem is talking about reversible work and actual work. Reversible work would be the work done under idealized (reversible, adiabatic) conditions, and actual work is, well, the real work considering any inefficiencies. But wait, in this problem, maybe the turbine isn't isentropic, so the actual work is different from the reversible.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the reversible work per pound and the actual work. So I think I need to compute two things: reversible work (which would be based on isentropic expansion) and the actual work based on the given exit conditions.

Wait wait, but isn't the actual work what we get from the SFEE with the given exit conditions, and the reversible work is the maximum possible work output (like if the process were isentropic). Hmm, but the problem says to find both.

So first, let's compute the actual work. 

For the actual work, I can use the SFEE with the given exit state (state 2). So actual work, w_actual = (h1 - h2) + (V1² - V2²)/2. 

But wait, I need to calculate the change in enthalpy (h1 - h2) and the change in kinetic energy.

Since air is an ideal gas with constant specific heats, the change in enthalpy depends only on temperature change. Because for ideal gases, h = c_p * T. So h1 - h2 = c_p (T1 - T2).

What's the value of c_p for air? I remember that the specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, for air is approximately 0.24 BTU/lbm-°F or 0.24 Btu/lbm·°F. Wait, but sometimes I've seen it as 0.24 or 0.25; maybe I should confirm. Alternatively, maybe I should use the more precise value, which I think is 0.24.

Wait, but the units are in British units, so yeah, 0.24 BTU per lbm per degree Fahrenheit.

So, first, let's compute the temperatures. T1 is 150°F, T2 is 40°F.

So, T1 = 150 + 459.67 = 609.67 °R (since to convert Fahrenheit to Rankine, we add 459.67). Similarly, T2 = 40 + 459.67 = 499.67 °R.

Wait, but wait, for enthalpy change, since h = c_p (T2 - T1) if it's h2 - h1. Wait, no, in the SFEE, it's h1 - h2. So in the actual work equation: w = (h1 - h2) + (V1² - V2²)/2.

So h1 - h2 = c_p (T1 - T2). Because h1 = c_p T1, h2 = c_p T2. So h1 - h2 = c_p (T1 - T2).

T1 in absolute terms is 609.67 °R, T2 is 499.67 °R. So T1 - T2 = 609.67 - 499.67 = 110 °R. Wait, but Rankine is an absolute scale, so the difference in Fahrenheit is the same as the difference in Rankine. Because each degree F is equal to a degree R in change. So, T1 in F is 150, T2 is 40. So the change is 110 F, which is 110 °R.

So h1 - h2 = 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F * 110 °F = 26.4 BTU/lbm.

Wait, that's the enthalpy part. Now, the kinetic energy part. (V1² - V2²)/2. Let's compute that.

V1 is 300 ft/s, V2 is 200 ft/s. So (300^2 - 200^2) = (90000 - 40000) = 50000 (ft²/s²). Divided by 2, that's 25000 ft²/s². 

Wait, but to convert this to BTU per lbm, I need to know the conversion factor between ft²/s² and BTU/lbm. Because 1 BTU is about 778 ft·lbf, and 1 lbf = 32.174 lbm·ft/s². Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the conversion factor for kinetic energy.

I remember that 1 Btu ≈ 25037 ft²·lbm/(lbm·s²) ??? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of units. Let me compute the kinetic energy change in terms of BTU per lbm.

The kinetic energy per unit mass is (V^2)/2, in (ft²/s²). So the change is (V1² - V2²)/2 = (300^2 - 200^2)/2 = (90000 - 40000)/2 = 25000 ft²/s².

Now, 1 BTU = 778 ft·lbf. And 1 lbf = 1 lbm * 32.174 ft/s² (from F=ma). So 1 ft·lbf = 32.174 lbm·ft²/s². So 1 BTU = 778 * 32.174 lbm·ft²/s² ≈ 25037 lbm·ft²/s².

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, 1 BTU is equal to 778 foot-pounds-force (ft·lbf). And 1 lbf equals 1 lbm * g_c, where g_c is the gravitational conversion factor, which is 32.174 lbm·ft/(lbf·s²). So 1 ft·lbf = 1 lbm * 32.174 ft²/s² (because lbf * ft = lbm * ft * (g_c ft/s²) / lbm) Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look up the conversion.

Wait, alternatively, I remember that 1 BTU/lbm equals approximately 25037 ft²/s². So, 1 (ft²/s²) equals 1/(25037) BTU/lbm. So, 25000 ft²/s² would be 25000 / 25037 ≈ 0.999 BTU/lbm.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let's compute it. Let's see, 1 BTU is 778 ft·lbf. 1 lbf is 32.174 lbm·ft/s², so 1 ft·lbf is 32.174 lbm·ft²/s². Therefore, 1 BTU is 778 * 32.174 lbm·ft²/s². Let me compute that:

778 * 32.174 ≈ 778 * 32 is 24,896, and 778 * 0.174 is around 135. So total is about 24,896 + 135 ≈ 25,031 lbm·ft²/s² per BTU.

So 1 BTU ≈ 25,031 lbm·ft²/s². Therefore, 1 lbm·ft²/s² is 1/25,031 BTU. So if I have 25,000 lbm·ft²/s², that's 25,000 / 25,031 ≈ 0.9986 BTU. So approximately 1 BTU/lbm.

Wait, but wait, the kinetic energy change is 25,000 lbm·ft²/s², so in BTU per lbm, it's 25,000 / 25,031 ≈ 0.9986, so about 1.0 BTU/lbm.

Wait, but wait, the equation is w = (h1 - h2) + (V1^2 - V2^2)/2. So (V1² - V2²)/2 is 25,000, which is about 1.0 BTU/lbm.

Wait, but in our case, (V1^2 - V2^2)/2 is positive because V1 is larger than V2. So V1 is 300, V2 is 200. So (300^2 - 200^2)/2 = 25,000 as above. So that's 25,000 lbm·ft²/s², which is about 1.0 BTU/lbm.

So the actual work, w_actual, is (h1 - h2) + (V1² - V2²)/2 = 26.4 BTU/lbm + 1.0 BTU/lbm ≈ 27.4 BTU/lbm.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the calculation: (h1 - h2) is 26.4, and the kinetic part is 25,000 lbm·ft²/s² which is about 0.9996 BTU/lbm. So 26.4 + 1.0 = 27.4.

So actual work is approximately 27.4 BTU/lbm.

Now, what about the reversible work? Reversible work would be the work done if the expansion were isentropic. So for that, we need to find the exit state assuming an isentropic process, and then compute the work based on that.

So, for reversible (isentropic) expansion, the work would be based on the ideal exit state. So let's find the exit temperature and pressure for the isentropic case.

Given that the process is isentropic, we can use the relation for an ideal gas: (T2s / T1) = (P2 / P1)^( (γ - 1)/γ ), where γ is the heat capacity ratio, c_p / c_v. For air, γ is approximately 1.4.

Wait, but we can compute it using specific heat values. Let's see: c_p is 0.24 BTU/lbm·°F, and c_v is c_p / γ. Wait, no, for air, c_p is 0.24, c_v is around 0.171 (since γ = 1.4, which is 7/5, so c_p = (7/5) c_v → c_v = (5/7) c_p ≈ 0.1714).

But perhaps it's easier to use the temperature-pressure relation. So, for an isentropic process:

(T2s / T1) = (P2 / P1)^( (γ-1)/γ )

We have P1 = 150 psia, P2 = 50 psia. So P2/P1 = 50/150 = 1/3.

So T2s = T1 * (1/3)^( (γ-1)/γ )

γ is 1.4, so (γ-1)/γ = 0.4/1.4 ≈ 0.2857.

Thus, T2s = 609.67 * (1/3)^0.2857.

Let me compute (1/3)^0.2857. Hmm. Let me think, 1/3 is about 0.3333. So 0.3333^0.2857.

I can approximate this using natural logs. Let’s take ln(0.3333) = -1.0986. Multiply by 0.2857: -1.0986 * 0.2857 ≈ -0.3142. Exponentiate: e^(-0.3142) ≈ 0.7305.

So T2s ≈ 609.67 * 0.7305 ≈ 609.67 * 0.73 ≈ Let me compute that:

600 * 0.73 = 438, 9.67 * 0.73 ≈ 7.0591. So total ≈ 438 + 7.06 ≈ 445.06 °R. 

Wait, wait, 609.67 * 0.7305: let's compute 600 * 0.7305 = 438.3, 9.67 * 0.7305 ≈ 7.06. So total T2s ≈ 445.36 °R.

Converting back to Fahrenheit: T2s (°F) = 445.36 - 459.67 = -14.31 °F. Wait, that seems really low. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 1/3 is about 0.3333. So (1/3)^(0.2857) is e^(ln(1/3)*0.2857) = e^(-1.0986 * 0.2857) ≈ e^(-0.3142) ≈ 0.7305. So that part is correct.

T1 is 150°F = 609.67 °R. Multiply by 0.7305: 609.67 * 0.7305 = ?

Let me compute 600 * 0.7305 = 438.3, and 9.67 * 0.7305 ≈ 7.06. So total is 445.36 °R, which is 445.36 - 459.67 = -14.31 °F. Hmm, so the isentropic exit temperature is -14.31 °F. But in the actual case, the exit temperature is 40°F, which is higher. So that suggests that the actual process is not isentropic, perhaps with some inefficiency leading to a higher exit temperature and thus less work done than the ideal case.

Wait, but the reversible work is calculated based on the isentropic exit state, right? So for reversible work, we have to compute the work as (h1 - h2s) + (V1² - V2s²)/2. But wait, no, the exit velocity in the reversible case would be the same as the actual case? Or wait, no, because the problem gives specific exit velocity, so perhaps in the actual case, the exit velocity is 200 ft/s, but in the reversible case, it might be different? Wait, no, I think the problem gives the exit velocity for the actual case, so for the reversible case, we have to assume that the exit velocity is such that the process is isentropic, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the kinetic energy doesn't change in the reversible case? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps for the reversible work, we're assuming that the turbine is operating at its maximum efficiency, which would involve an isentropic expansion, and perhaps the exit velocity is such that the kinetic energy is the same as in the actual case. Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the reversible work is calculated without considering the change in kinetic energy because it's considered as part of the overall process. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the reversible work is calculated using the same velocities as the actual work, assuming that the only difference is the enthalpy change. But that doesn't make sense because in reality, the exit velocity would depend on the exit pressure and temperature. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should proceed as follows: for the reversible work, the process is isentropic, so we'll calculate the ideal exit temperature and pressure, then compute the work using the same SFEE but with the isentropic exit state.

But wait, the exit velocity in the reversible case would not necessarily be 200 ft/s. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the reversible case, the exit velocity is adjusted to account for the different exit pressure and temperature. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the reversible work doesn't account for the KE change, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think. The reversible work would be based on the ideal exit state (isentropic), but the actual work is based on the given exit state (with higher entropy). So, for reversible work, the exit state is T2s and P2 = 50 psia. So, in that case, the enthalpy change would be h1 - h2s, which is c_p (T1 - T2s) = 0.24 * (609.67 - 445.36) = 0.24 * 164.31 ≈ 39.46 BTU/lbm.

Wait, wait, no, let me compute T1 and T2s in Fahrenheit. Wait, T1 is 150°F, which is 609.67 °R. T2s is 445.36 °R, which is 445.36 - 459.67 = -14.31°F.

Wait, but the change in temperature is 150 - (-14.31) = 164.31°F. So, the enthalpy change is 0.24 * 164.31 ≈ 39.46 BTU/lbm.

But then, in the actual case, the exit
