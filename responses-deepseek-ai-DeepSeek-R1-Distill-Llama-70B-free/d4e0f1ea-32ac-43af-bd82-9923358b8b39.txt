Okay, so I've got this question here about two coin-flipping games, and I need to decide how many times to flip the coin for each to maximize my chances of winning. Hmm, let's break it down.

The first game is where you win if you throw between 45% and 55% heads. That sounds like you want your results to be close to 50% heads. The second game is when you need more than 80% heads to win. So that's a much higher threshold.

I remember something about probability and maybe the law of large numbers. Oh right, the more times you flip a coin, the closer the results should get to the expected probability, which is 50% for a fair coin. But wait, how does that apply here?

For the first game, I think flipping more times would be better. Because with more flips, the actual percentage of heads will be closer to 50%. So if I flip 300 times, the range of 45-55% is a narrower window around the mean. But wait, I'm trying to get within that window, so a smaller standard deviation would help. Because with more flips, the distribution is tighter. So for the first game, more flips (like 300) would make it more likely that the percentage falls within 45-55% because there's less variance.

Wait, but no, wait a second. If I flip fewer times, like 30, there's more variance. So maybe the chance of being within 45-55% is lower because the distribution is wider. So for the first game, flipping 300 times would give a higher probability of landing in that range. Because the distribution is tighter, so the chance of being within 5% of the mean is higher.

For the second game, I need more than 80% heads. But since the coin is fair, the expected value is 50%, so getting 80% is way outside. So I need a rare event. But how does the number of flips affect this? I think with more flips, the probability of getting an extreme result (like 80% heads) becomes smaller, because the distribution tightens. Wait, no—actually, with more flips, the variance decreases. The standard deviation is sqrt(n p (1-p)), so for larger n, the standard deviation increases, but the standard error (which is SD/sqrt(n)) decreases. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the normal approximation.

Wait, the probability of getting more than 80% heads in 30 flips versus 300. Let's consider using the normal approximation for a binomial distribution.

The mean (μ) is np, which for 30 flips is 15 heads. For 300 flips, it's 150 heads. The standard deviation (σ) is sqrt(np(1-p)) which for 30 is sqrt(30*0.5*0.5) = sqrt(7.5) ≈ 2.738. For 300, it's sqrt(300*.25) = sqrt(75) ≈ 8.660.

Now, for the second game, we want the probability that the number of heads is more than 80% of n. So for n=30, 80% is 24 heads. For n=300, 80% is 240 heads.

We need to find the z-score for each case and see which one gives a higher probability.

For n=30, X >24: So X=24. Let me compute the z-score.

Wait, since it's a discrete variable, maybe we should use continuity correction. So for X >24, it's X >=25. So the z-score would be (25 - 15)/2.738 ≈ (10)/2.738 ≈ 3.65. The probability beyond z=3.65 is like 0.13% or something.

For n=300, X >240. So X >=241. The mean is 150, so (241 -150)/8.660 ≈ 91 /8.66 ≈ 10.51. That's a z-score of about 10.5, which is way beyond typical tables. The probability is practically zero.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 80% of 300 is 240, which is 90 heads above the mean. That's way beyond what's likely. So the probability is super low in both cases, but perhaps higher for 30 flips than 300.

Wait, but for 30 flips, getting 24 heads is 80%, which is 24/30=0.8. The z-score is high, but for 30 flips, maybe it's within the realm of possibility. For 300 flips, getting 240 is 240/300 = 0.8, but that's 90 over the mean of 150, which is way more in terms of standard deviations. So the probability is higher for 30 flips than for 300.

Wait no, the z-score for 30 flips was about 3.65, which is 0.13% (two-tailed, so maybe 0.26% total beyond that point). For 300 flips, the z-score is 10.51, which is effectively zero probability. So the chance is higher for 30 flips. So for the second game, you want to flip fewer times because the probability of getting an extreme result is higher when the sample size is smaller.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The more flips you have, the less likely you are to get an extreme percentage. So for the second game, which requires a high percentage, you have a better chance with fewer flips. Because with 30 flips, the variance is higher, so the probability of getting 80% is higher than with 300 flips.

So putting it together: For the first game, you want more flips (300) because it's better to have a tighter distribution around 50%, making it more likely to be within 45-55%. For the second game, you want fewer flips (30) because the probability of getting 80% is higher with the larger variance of smaller n.

So the correct option would be to choose 300 for the first game and 30 for the second. Looking at the options:

Option D: 300 times for the first game and 30 times for the second. So the answer is D.

To determine the optimal number of coin flips for each game, we analyze the probability of winning based on the number of flips and the requirements of each game.

### First Game: Winning if heads are between 45% and 55%
- The goal is to have the percentage of heads close to 50%. 
- With more flips (e.g., 300), the law of large numbers ensures that the distribution of heads will be tighter around the mean (50%), increasing the likelihood of landing within the 45% to 55% range.
- Fewer flips (e.g., 30) result in a wider distribution, making it harder to stay within this range.
- Therefore, flipping 300 times is better for the first game.

### Second Game: Winning if heads exceed 80%
- This requires an extreme outcome, far from the expected 50% heads.
- With fewer flips (e.g., 30), the variance is larger, making extreme outcomes more likely. For example, getting 24 heads out of 30 (80%) is more plausible than getting 240 heads out of 300 (80%).
- With more flips (e.g., 300), the distribution tightens, and the probability of such an extreme outcome becomes practically zero.
- Therefore, flipping 30 times is better for the second game.

### Conclusion
For the first game, flipping 300 times increases the chances of staying within 45% to 55% heads. For the second game, flipping 30 times provides a better chance of achieving the extreme outcome of more than 80% heads.

The correct option is **D: 300 times for the first game and 30 times for the second**.
