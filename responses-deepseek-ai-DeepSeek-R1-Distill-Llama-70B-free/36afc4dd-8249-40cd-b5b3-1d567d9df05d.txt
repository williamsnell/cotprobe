Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about x-ray tubes and spectral lines. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that an x-ray tube with a copper target is emitting lines other than those due to copper. They provided the K_alpha line of copper as 1.5405 Å. The other two observed lines have wavelengths of 0.7092 Å and 1.6578 Å. I need to identify the impurities from the given options.

Wait, I remember that the K_alpha line is a specific characteristic x-ray emission line. The wavelength of these lines depends on the atomic number of the element. So each element has its own characteristic K_alpha wavelength.

I think the key here is to determine the elements corresponding to the two new wavelengths. Once I find those, I can look at the options to see which pair matches.

First, I should recall the formula for the wavelength of K-alpha lines. I remember that the wavelength is related to the atomic number (Z) of the element. The formula is something like λ = 1/(Z - 1)^2 * some constant. Oh wait, maybe it's the inverse square? Let me think.

Oh right, the K-alpha line corresponds to the transition of an electron from the L shell (n=2) to the K shell (n=1). The energy of this transition is given by:

E = (Z-1)^2 * Rydberg's constant (in terms of energy), but when converted to wavelength, it's inversely proportional.

So the formula for the wavelength is λ = (n^2)/(Z-1)^2 * (some constant). Wait no, more accurately, the wavelength is given by 1/λ = (Z-1)^2 * (1/λ_0), where λ_0 is the wavelength for hydrogen, I think. Or maybe it's (Z-squared) times the Rydberg constant?

Wait, the Rydberg formula for hydrogen is 1/λ = R*(1/(n1)^2 - 1/(n2)^2), where n1 < n2. For K-alpha, the transition is n=2 to n=1, so substituting:

1/λ = R*(1/1^2 - 1/2^2) = R*(1 - 1/4) = (3/4)R.

So for hydrogen, λ would be 4/(3R). But for other elements, it's scaled by Z^2. Because in multi-electron atoms, the effective nuclear charge is Z-σ, but for K-alpha, we can approximate it using Z-1 for the effective charge. So the formula becomes:

1/λ = (Z-1)^2 * (3/4) R.

Wait, no, maybe the correct formula is λ = (hc)/(E), where E is the energy difference. Alternatively, I've heard of the relation λ = 1/(k*(Z-something)^2), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I remember that the K-alpha line for an element with atomic number Z is given approximately by:

λ (in Ångströms) ≈ 0.154 / (Z-1)^2.

Wait, that sounds familiar. Let me check. For copper, Z is 29. So plugging into that formula:

λ ≈ 0.154 / (28)^2 = 0.154 /784 ≈ 0.000196 Å, but wait that's not right because I know copper's K-alpha is around 1.54 Å. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is λ (Å) ≈ 0.154 * n^2 / (Z-1)^2, but n is the principal quantum number.

Wait no, maybe I should think in terms of Moseley's law. Moseley found that the square root of the frequency is proportional to Z. Since frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, the formula would be sqrt(1/λ) proportional to Z.

Wait, Moseley's law states that the frequency (and hence 1/λ) of the K-alpha line is proportional to (Z-1)^2. So 1/λ = k*(Z-1)^2, where k is a constant.

From the known K-alpha of copper, I can find k. Then use that to find Z for the other lines.

Copper has a K-alpha wavelength of 1.5405 Å. So 1/λ = 1 / 1.5405 ≈ 0.6495 Å^-1.

So 0.6495 = k*(29-1)^2 = k*(28)^2 = k*784.

So solving for k: k = 0.6495 / 784 ≈ 0.0008287 Å^-1.

Now, for the other two wavelengths, 0.7092 Å and 1.6578 Å, I can find their Z values.

First for 0.7092 Å:

1/λ = 1 / 0.7092 ≈ 1.4095 Å^-1.

Set this equal to k*(Z1-1)^2:

1.4095 = 0.0008287 * (Z1-1)^2.

Wait, that would mean (Z1-1)^2 = 1.4095 / 0.0008287 ≈ let's compute that.

1.4095 / 0.0008287 ≈ 1701. So (Z1-1)^2 ≈ 1701. Take square root: Z1-1 ≈ sqrt(1701) ≈ 41.24. So Z1 ≈ 42.24. That can't be right because atomic numbers are integers. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait wait, no, wait a second. Let me recalculate the calculation.

Wait, (Z1-1)^2 = (1.4095) / (0.0008287)

1.4095 / 0.0008287 ≈ let's compute that.

Let me compute 1.4095 ÷ 0.0008287.

Hmm, 1.4095 / 0.0008287 is the same as 1.4095 * (1 / 0.0008287) ≈ 1.4095 * 1206. So 1.4095 * 1206 ≈ 1700. So (Z1-1)^2 ≈ 1700. So Z1-1 ≈ sqrt(1700) ≈ 41.23. So Z1 ≈ 42.23. But that's not possible because Z must be integer. Hmm, perhaps I have an error in the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is 1/λ = (Z-1)^2 * (1/λ0), where λ0 is a constant. What is λ0? For hydrogen, the K-alpha would correspond to transition from n=2 to n=1. So what's the wavelength for hydrogen's K-alpha? Wait, hydrogen doesn't have a K-alpha line because it only has one electron. So perhaps the formula is adjusted.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up or recall the K-alpha wavelengths for various elements.

Wait, another approach: I know the K-alpha wavelength for a few elements. For example, iron has a K-alpha around 1.937 Å, cobalt around 1.79 Å, nickel about 1.658 Å, copper 1.5405, zinc 1.435 Å. Wait, that's not matching. Let me think again.

Wait, I might have this mixed up. Let me think: higher Z elements have shorter K-alpha wavelengths because the electrons are moving faster, so higher energy (shorter wavelength). So copper's K-alpha is 1.54 Å, which is shorter than that of nickel, which is higher Z? Wait, no, copper's Z is 29, nickel is 28, so nickel has a longer wavelength than copper. Wait no, higher Z means higher energy, so shorter wavelength. So nickel (Z=28) should have longer K-alpha than copper (Z=29). So if copper is 1.54, nickel should have a longer wavelength than that, like around 1.658? Hmm, wait one of the given lines is 1.6578 Å, which is longer than copper's, so that would correspond to a lower Z element.

Wait, let me list down some K-alpha wavelengths for nearby elements. I might remember that:

- Copper (Cu, Z=29): ~1.54 Å

- Nickel (Ni, Z=28): around 1.658 Å

- Cobalt (Co, Z=27): maybe ~1.79 Å

- Iron (Fe, Z=26): ~1.937 Å

- Let me check another way. The other line is 0.7092 Å. That's a much shorter wavelength, so higher energy. So higher Z element.

Wait, possible elements with higher Z than copper would have shorter K-alpha. So 0.7092 Å would correspond to a higher Z element than 29.

Wait, but the tube is copper, so the impurities must be other metals. Maybe the impurities are metals either lower or higher in Z than copper.

Wait, but the problem says it's a copper target, so maybe the other elements are present as impurities. So their K-alpha lines would be either shorter or longer than copper's, depending on whether their Z is higher or lower.

So the line at 1.6578 is longer than 1.54, so lower Z. So that's an element with lower Z than copper, which is Z=29.

The other line is 0.7092 Å, which is much shorter, so higher Z than copper.

So I need to find two elements, one with Z just below 29 (since 1.6578 is just a bit longer than 1.54), and another with Z higher than 29.

Wait, but let's try using the formula again. Maybe I messed up the calculation earlier.

Using Moseley's law approach:

For copper, λ = 1.5405 Å.

So 1/λ = 0.6495 Å^-1.

According to Moseley's law, 1/λ ∝ (Z-1)^2.

So 0.6495 = k*(28)^2.

So k = 0.6495 / 784 ≈ 0.0008287 Å^-1.

Now, let's compute for the first unknown line: 0.7092 Å.

Compute 1/λ: 1/0.7092 ≈ 1.4095 Å^-1.

So 1.4095 = k*(Z1 -1)^2.

We know k is 0.0008287, so:

1.4095 = 0.0008287*(Z1-1)^2

=> (Z1-1)^2 = 1.4095 / 0.0008287 ≈ 1700.

So (Z1-1) is sqrt(1700) ≈ 41.23. So Z1 ≈ 42.23. Hmm, but Z has to be an integer. Wait, maybe Z1 is 42? Because 41.23 is close to 41, but that's not an integer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 1700 is (Z1-1)^2. So Z1-1 = sqrt(1700) ≈ 41.23. So Z1 is 42.23? That's conflicting because Z must be integer. But perhaps I should check if the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.4095 / 0.0008287 more accurately.

Let me compute 1.4095 / 0.0008287.

Dividing 1.4095 by 0.0008287:

0.0008287 is 8.287e-4.

1.4095 / 8.287e-4 = 1.4095 / 0.0008287 ≈ let's approximate:

0.0008287 × 1700 = 0.0008287 * 1700 = approx 1.40979. Which is very close to 1.4095. So (Z1-1)^2 is approximately 1700, so Z1-1 = sqrt(1700) ≈ 41.23. So Z1 ≈ 42.23, but that's not possible because Z must be an integer. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the formula is 1/λ = (Z^2) * (some constant), but I thought it was (Z-1)^2. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses Z instead of Z-1.

Wait, maybe I should try using Z instead of Z-1. Let me try that.

So for copper, Z = 29.

So 1/λ = k * Z^2.

1.5405 Å → 1/λ = 0.6495 = k * (29)^2 → 29^2 is 841.

So k = 0.6495 / 841 ≈ 0.000772.

Now for the unknown line 0.7092 Å → 1/λ = 1.4095.

Set equal to k * Z1^2 → 1.4095 = 0.000772 * Z1^2 → Z1^2 = 1.4095 / 0.000772 ≈ 1825 → Z1 ≈ sqrt(1825) ≈ 42.72. So Z1 ≈ 43. But wait, the atomic number for which element is 43? That's technetium (Tc), but that's a radioactive element, maybe not as an impurity. Hmm, but maybe the formula is correct.

Wait, but let's check the other line. The other line is 1.6578 Å → 1/λ ≈ 0.6032.

Using 1/λ = k*Z2^2 → 0.6032 = 0.000772 * Z2^2 → Z2^2 ≈ 0.6032 / 0.000772 ≈ 781 → Z2 ≈ 27.95 → around 28, which is nickel (Z=28). So that would make sense.

So in this case, the two impurities would have Z ≈ 43 and 28. But 43 is technetium, which is not a common impurity in such tubes. Hmm.

Wait, but earlier when using (Z-1)^2, I got Z1 ≈ 42.23, which would be around 42, which is molybdenum (Mo). Molybdenum has Z=42, and its K-alpha would be shorter than copper's.

Wait, let's see. Using Z-1 approach:

For 0.7092 Å:

1/λ = 1.4095 = k*(Z1-1)^2.

We have k = 0.0008287.

So (Z1-1)^2 = 1.4095 / 0.0008287 ≈ 1700 → Z1-1 ≈ 41.23 → Z1 ≈ 42.23 → so Z1=42, which is molybdenum (Mo).

For the other line, 1.6578 Å:

1/λ ≈ 0.6032 = 0.0008287*(Z2-1)^2 → (Z2-1)^2 ≈ 0.6032 / 0.0008287 ≈ 728 → Z2-1 ≈ 26.95 → Z2 ≈ 27.95 → Z2=28, which is nickel (Ni).

So the two impurities would be molybdenum (Z=42) and nickel (Z=28).

Looking at the options, let's see. Option E is Molybdenum and Nickel. So E is the correct choice.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me cross-check with known K-alpha wavelengths.

I recall that molybdenum's K-alpha is around 0.71 Å, which matches the 0.7092 given. And nickel's K-alpha is around 1.658 Å, which matches the 1.6578 given. So yes, that fits.

So the impurities are Mo and Ni, which is option E.
</think>

To identify the impurities in the x-ray tube, we analyze the given wavelengths of the K-alpha lines. The K-alpha wavelength is characteristic of each element and depends on its atomic number \( Z \). Using Moseley's law, the relationship between the wavelength \( \lambda \) and \( Z \) is given by:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = k \cdot (Z-1)^2
\]

where \( k \) is a constant. For copper (\( Z = 29 \)), the known K-alpha wavelength is \( \lambda = 1.5405 \, \text{Å} \). Using this, we calculate \( k \):

\[
\frac{1}{1.5405} = k \cdot (29-1)^2 \implies k = \frac{0.6495}{784} \approx 0.0008287 \, \text{Å}^{-1}.
\]

Now, for the unknown wavelengths:

1. **For \( \lambda = 0.7092 \, \text{Å} \):**
   \[
   \frac{1}{0.7092} \approx 1.4095 \, \text{Å}^{-1}.
   \]
   Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   1.4095 = 0.0008287 \cdot (Z_1 - 1)^2 \implies (Z_1 - 1)^2 = \frac{1.4095}{0.0008287} \approx 1700.
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   Z_1 - 1 \approx \sqrt{1700} \approx 41.23 \implies Z_1 \approx 42.23.
   \]
   Since \( Z \) must be an integer, \( Z_1 = 42 \), corresponding to molybdenum (Mo).

2. **For \( \lambda = 1.6578 \, \text{Å} \):**
   \[
   \frac{1}{1.6578} \approx 0.6032 \, \text{Å}^{-1}.
   \]
   Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   0.6032 = 0.0008287 \cdot (Z_2 - 1)^2 \implies (Z_2 - 1)^2 = \frac{0.6032}{0.0008287} \approx 728.
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   Z_2 - 1 \approx \sqrt{728} \approx 26.95 \implies Z_2 \approx 27.95.
   \]
   Since \( Z \) must be an integer, \( Z_2 = 28 \), corresponding to nickel (Ni).

Thus, the
