Question:

We know that radiation and chemicals can cause cancer. Can viruses be a cause of cancer?

Options:

A: Only radiation can cause cancer
B: Only chemicals can cause cancer
C: Only inherited genetics can cause cancer
D: Only lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise can cause cancer
E: Yes, viruses can be a cause of cancer
F: No, viruses cannot cause cancer
G: Viruses can increase the risk but are not a direct cause of cancer
H: Yes, but only bacteria, not viruses, can be a cause of cancer

Okay, so I've got this question here about whether viruses can cause cancer. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think about what I know.

I remember that cancer can be caused by various factors. I know radiation and chemicals are two of them. Oh right, like how UV radiation can cause skin cancer and certain chemicals like tobacco smoke can lead to lung cancer. But what about viruses?

Wait, I think some viruses are linked to cancers. For example, the human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with cervical cancer. And then there's hepatitis B and C, which I've heard can lead to liver cancer. Oh, and Epstein-Barr virus is connected to some lymphomas, like Burkitt's lymphoma. So that makes me think that yes, viruses can cause cancer.

Looking at the options, option E says "Yes, viruses can be a cause of cancer." That seems right. Option F says no, which I don't think is correct because of the examples I just thought of. Option G says viruses can increase risk but aren't direct causes. But I think some viruses directly cause cancer by integrating into the host DNA or causing chronic inflammation, which leads to cancerous changes. So G might not be accurate.

So the correct answer should be E.

The correct answer is E. Yes, viruses can be a cause of cancer. Certain viruses, such as HPV, hepatitis B and C, and Epstein-Barr virus, are known to directly contribute to the development of specific cancers by integrating into host DNA or causing chronic inflammation. 

Answer: E
