Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Tonight, the daughter of a woman whose highest goal was a future for her children talks to our nation's oldest political party about a future for us all. Tonight, the daughter of working Americans tells all Americans that the future is within our reach, if we're willing to reach for it. Tonight, the daughter of an immigrant from Italy has been chosen to run for (vice) president in the new land my father came to love.… Americans want to live by the same set of rules. But under this administration, the rules are rigged against too many of our people. It isn't right that every year the share of taxes paid by individual citizens is going up, while the share paid by large corporations is getting smaller and smaller.… It isn't right that young couples question whether to bring children into a world of 50,000 nuclear warheads. That isn't the vision for which Americans have struggled for more than two centuries.… Tonight, we reclaim our dream. We're going to make the rules of American life work for all Americans again.… The issue is not what America can do for women, but what women can do for America.

Okay, so I have this question about Geraldine Ferraro and I need to figure out which woman from the options she can be most directly compared to. Let's start by reading the speech excerpt provided. 

In the speech, Ferraro talks about being the daughter of an immigrant, running for vice president, and addressing issues like taxes and nuclear warheads. She emphasizes making the rules work for all Americans and mentions women's roles, saying it's about what women can do for America, not the other way around.

So, the key points here are her being a woman in a high political position, advocating for fairness and change, and breaking barriers for women. She's a vice presidential nominee, which is a significant political role.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Jane Addams - She was a social worker and activist, known for Hull House. Not directly a political figure in the same way as Ferraro.

B: Abigail Adams - An early American figure, known for her letters to her husband. Not a modern politician.

C: Ruth Bader Ginsburg - Supreme Court Justice, so she's in a high position but in the judiciary, not executive like VP.

D: Harriet Tubman - Escaped slavery and helped others, more of an abolitionist than a politician.

E: Rosa Parks - Civil rights activist, known for the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Not a politician.

F: Sandra Day O'Connor - Also a Supreme Court Justice, similar to Ginsburg.

G: Hillary Clinton - She was the First Lady, a Senator, Secretary of State, and ran for President. She's a high-profile politician, so that's a possible match.

H: Eleanor Roosevelt - She was First Lady and a diplomat, but not elected office. She was influential in policy, though.

I: Susan B. Anthony - A leading figure in women's suffrage, more of a suffragist than a politician.

J: Amelia Earhart - Aviator, not a politician.

Wait, so Geraldine Ferraro was the first woman to run for Vice President on a major party ticket. So she's a trailblazer in politics. Comparing that to the options, who else was a trailblazer in high political office?

Hillary Clinton was the first woman to be nominated for President by a major party, and she also served in various other roles. So both Ferraro and Clinton broke significant barriers for women in politics.

Eleanor Roosevelt was influential, but she wasn't elected. Sandra Day O'Connor was a first in the judiciary, which is different. So the closest comparison would be Hillary Clinton, as both were pioneers in high-level political positions, specifically seeking the presidency or vice presidency.

Geraldine Ferraro can be most directly compared to Hillary Clinton, as both were trailblazers for women in high-level U.S. politics. Ferraro was the first woman to run for Vice President on a major party ticket, while Clinton was the first woman to be nominated for President by a major party. Both broke significant barriers and advocated for women's roles in politics.
