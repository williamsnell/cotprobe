Question:

Ann, Bea, and Carla were three friends who lived in the same neighborhood. While Ann was away on a business trip, someone broke into her garage and stole her golf clubs. The next week, Ann was planning to go on vacation and asked Bea if she could borrow her golf clubs. Bea agreed and loaned her golf clubs to Ann, who promised to return them after her vacation. When Ann returned home, she kept the golf clubs and continued to use them. A few weeks later, Bea was having dinner with Carla and learned that Carla owed Ann $4,000. Carla had just been laid off from her job and did not have the money to repay Ann. Bea told Carla that she would contact Ann and make arrangements to repay the loan on her behalf. Thereupon, Ann and Bea entered into a written agreement wherein Bea promised to pay Ann, at a rate of $400 a month, the matured $4,000 debt that Carla owed Ann. In the same written instrument, Ann promised to return Bea's golf clubs, which she still had in her possession. Ann, however, made no written or oral. commitment to forbear to sue Carla to collect the $4,000 debt; and Bea made no oral or written request for any such forbearance. After this agreement between Ann and Bea was signed and executed, Ann promptly returned the golf clubs to Bea. For the next six months, Bea made and Ann accepted the $400 monthly payments as agreed. During that period, Ann, in fact, did forbear to take any legal action against Carla. However, Bea then repudiated her agreement with Ann, and 30 days later Ann filed a contract action against Bea. Assume that the applicable statute of limitations on Ann's antecedent claim against Carla expired the day before Ann filed her contract action against Bea. Which of the following is the most persuasive argument that Bea is not liable to Ann under the terms of their written agreement?

Options:

A: Since Ann did not expressly promise to forbear to sue Carla to collect the antecedent $4,000 debt, Ann's forbearance for six months could not constitute consideration for Bea's promise.
B: Since the written agreement between Bea and Ann shows a gross imbalance between the values of the promises exchanged, the consideration for Bea's promise was legally insufficient to support it.
C: Since Carla, when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, had a pre-existing duty to repay the $4,000 debt to Ann, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann.
D: Since Ann had a pre-existing duty to return Bea's golf clubs to her when the agreement between Ann and Bea was made, there was no consideration for Bea's promise to Ann.

Okay, so I've got this contract law problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again and try to understand all the details.

So, Ann, Bea, and Carla are friends. Ann went on a business trip, and someone stole her golf clubs. The next week, she borrows Bea's golf clubs for her vacation. She promises to return them, but when she comes back, she keeps them and continues using them. 

Then, a few weeks later, Bea and Carla have dinner. Bea learns that Carla owes Ann $4,000, but Carla just got laid off and can't pay. Bea tells Carla she'll contact Ann and make arrangements to repay the loan on her behalf. So, Ann and Bea make a written agreement. Bea promises to pay Ann $400 a month for the $4,000 Carla owed. In the same agreement, Ann promises to return Bea's golf clubs, which she still has. 

Importantly, the problem states that Ann didn't make any written or oral commitment to forbear (meaning not take legal action) against Carla to collect the $4,000. Bea also didn't ask Ann to forbear. After this agreement, Ann returns the golf clubs promptly. Bea pays for six months, and Ann accepts. During that time, Ann didn't sue Carla. But then Bea repudiates the agreement, and 30 days later, Ann sues Bea. The statute of limitations on Ann's claim against Carla expired the day before Ann sued Bea.

The question is about which argument would best show that Bea is not liable to Ann under their agreement.

The options are A to D. I need to pick the most persuasive.

First, I remember that for a contract to be enforceable, there must be consideration. Consideration is a bargained-for exchange where each party gives something of legal value. Without consideration, a promise may not be enforceable.

Looking at the agreement between Ann and Bea: Bea promises to pay $4,000 at $400/month, and Ann promises to return the golf clubs. 

Wait, but in the scenario, Ann had already borrowed the golf clubs and didn't return them. So when she agreed to return them as part of the written agreement, does that constitute consideration?

Wait, I think the general rule is that if a party does something they're already legally obligated to do, that doesn't count as consideration. So if Ann was already supposed to return the clubs, her promise to do so isn't new consideration.

In this case, Ann had borrowed the clubs, used them, and didn't return them. So she was under a pre-existing duty to return them. So when she agreed to return them as part of the contract with Bea, that wouldn't be new consideration because she was already required to do that.

So if Ann's promise to return the clubs wasn't new consideration, then Bea's promise to pay might not have any consideration from Ann. Without consideration, the contract isn't valid.

Looking at the options, option D says: Since Ann had a pre-existing duty to return Bea's golf clubs, there was no consideration for Bea's promise. That seems to fit.

But wait, what about the forbearance part? The problem says Ann didn't promise to forbear, but she did forbear for six months. But forbearance can sometimes count as consideration if it's a promise to forbear. But here, Ann didn't make any such promise. So that can't be the consideration.

So the only thing Ann gave was returning the clubs, which she was already supposed to do. So no consideration from Ann, making the contract unenforceable against Bea. Therefore, Bea isn't liable because there's no consideration.

So the correct answer should be D.

The question revolves around whether Bea is liable to Ann under their written agreement, focusing on the issue of consideration. For a contract to be enforceable, there must be consideration, which requires a bargained-for exchange where each party provides something of legal value. 

In this case, Ann promised to return Bea's golf clubs, which she had borrowed earlier. However, Ann was already under a pre-existing duty to return the clubs, as they were loaned to her. Since Ann's promise to return the clubs did not constitute new consideration (as she was already legally obligated to do so), there was no valid consideration for Bea's promise to pay the $4,000 debt. The fact that Ann forbore from suing Carla for six months is irrelevant because Ann did not expressly promise to forbear, and forbearance without a promise cannot serve as consideration.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because Ann's forbearance, even if it occurred, was not part of the written agreement and thus cannot constitute consideration.
- **Option B** is incorrect because the imbalance in the values of the promises does not negate the requirement of consideration.
- **Option C** is incorrect because Carla's pre-existing duty to repay the debt does not directly impact the consideration between Ann and Bea.
- **Option D** is correct because Ann's promise to return the golf clubs was not new consideration, as she was already legally obligated to do so.

Thus, the most persuasive argument is that Ann's promise to return the golf clubs did not provide consideration for Bea's promise, making Bea not liable under the agreement.
