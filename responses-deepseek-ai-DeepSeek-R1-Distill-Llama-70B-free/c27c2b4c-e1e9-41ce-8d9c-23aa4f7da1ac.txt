Question:

A student decides that, having already spent three hours studying for an exam, she should spend one more hour studying for the same exam. Which of the following is most likely true?

Options:

A: The marginal benefit of the third hour was likely greater than the marginal benefit of the fourth hour.
B: The marginal cost of the third hour was likely greater than the marginal cost of the fourth hour.
C: The marginal benefit of the fourth hour is at least as great as the marginal cost of the fourth hour.
D: The marginal benefit of the fourth hour is certainly less than the marginal cost of the fourth hour.
E: The marginal cost of the fourth hour is at least as great as the marginal benefit of the fourth hour.
F: The marginal cost of the fourth hour is likely less than the marginal cost of the third hour.
G: The marginal benefit of the fourth hour is certainly more than the marginal cost of the fourth hour.
H: Without knowing the studentâ€™s opportunity cost of studying, we have no way of knowing whether or not her marginal benefits outweigh her marginal costs.
I: Without knowing the student's other commitments, we cannot determine the marginal cost or benefit of the fourth hour.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question. Let me read it again. 

The question says that a student has already studied for three hours and decides to study for one more hour. So, she's choosing to go from three to four hours. The question is asking which statement is most likely true based on this decision.

I remember that in economics, decisions are made at the margin, meaning we look at the additional benefits and costs of one more unit. So, the student is deciding whether the fourth hour is worth it.

The options are A through I. Let me go through each one.

Option A says the marginal benefit of the third hour was greater than the fourth. Hmm. Well, if she's choosing to study a fourth hour, that suggests that the marginal benefit of the fourth hour is still positive enough to be worth it. But does that mean the third hour was better than the fourth? I'm not sure. Typically, marginal benefits decrease as you do more of something, like studying. So each additional hour gives less benefit than the previous. So the third hour's marginal benefit would be higher than the fourth. So A could be correct, but let me check the other options.

Option B: The marginal cost of the third hour was greater than the fourth. Wait, marginal cost usually increases as you do more, because of opportunity cost. The more you study, the more you might be giving up other things you could do, so each additional hour might cost more in terms of what you're missing. So if the third hour's cost is more than the fourth, that doesn't fit. Normally, I think each next hour has a higher marginal cost. So maybe B is not correct. But I'm not sure.

Option C: The marginal benefit of the fourth hour is at least as great as the marginal cost. If she's choosing to study the fourth hour, that implies that the marginal benefit is at least equal to or greater than the marginal cost. Because if the benefit wasn't worth the cost, she wouldn't do it. So this makes sense. She must think the benefit of studying that fourth hour is at least equal to the cost (what she's giving up), otherwise she wouldn't choose to do it. So C seems likely to be correct.

Option D: The marginal benefit of the fourth hour is certainly less than the cost. That would mean she's making a mistake by studying, which we don't know. So D is probably not right because she decided to do it, implying benefit is at least as much as cost.

Option E: The marginal cost is at least as great as the marginal benefit. Wait, that's the opposite of C. So if she's studying, then the benefit should be >= cost, making E incorrect. Unless, wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again. If marginal cost >= marginal benefit, she wouldn't do it. But she did, so E would be incorrect. So E is not right.

Option F: The marginal cost of the fourth hour is less than the third. But usually, marginal costs increase, so each next hour should have a higher cost. So I don't think F is correct.

Option G: The marginal benefit is certainly more than the cost. But the question says "at least as great", so G uses "certainly more", which is stronger. Maybe she's exactly equal, so G is too certain. So C is more accurate.

Option H: Without knowing opportunity cost, we can't know. But the decision itself implies that marginal benefit is >= marginal cost, regardless of what the actual opportunity cost is. So H is not correct because we can infer from her decision that, for her, the marginal benefit outweighs the marginal cost.

Option I: Without knowing other commitments, we can't determine the marginal cost or benefit. But again, her decision tells us that for her, the marginal benefit is at least equal to the cost. So I don't think this is correct.

So going back, the correct answer is C. The marginal benefit of the fourth hour is at least as great as the marginal cost of the fourth hour. Because she chose to do it, implying benefit >= cost.

The question involves a student deciding to study for an additional hour, moving from three hours to four. This decision is analyzed through the lens of marginal benefits and marginal costs, which are central to economic decision-making. Each option is evaluated based on the implications of the student's choice.

- **Option A:** Suggests the marginal benefit of the third hour was greater than the fourth. While marginal benefits typically decrease with additional hours, this does not directly relate to why the student chose to study the fourth hour. This option is less relevant.

- **Option B:** Claims the marginal cost of the third hour was greater than the fourth. Marginal costs usually increase as more hours are spent, due to rising opportunity costs. This makes B unlikely.

- **Option C:** States the marginal benefit of the fourth hour is at least as great as the marginal cost. This aligns with the student's decision to study the fourth hour, as it implies the benefit outweighs or equals the cost. This is consistent with rational decision-making.

- **Option D:** Argues the marginal benefit is certainly less than the marginal cost. This contradicts the student's decision to study, as it would imply she is making a suboptimal choice.

- **Option E:** Suggests the marginal cost is at least as great as the marginal benefit. This is the opposite of what is implied by the student's decision, making it incorrect.

- **Option F:** Claims the marginal cost of the fourth hour is less than the third. Marginal costs typically increase, so this is unlikely.

- **Option G:** States the marginal benefit is certainly more than the cost. While the benefit must outweigh the cost for the decision to be made, the use of "certainly" makes this statement too strong.

- **Option H:** Argues that without knowing the opportunity cost, we cannot assess the decision. However, the decision itself implies that the marginal benefit outweighs the marginal cost, making this option unnecessary.

- **Option I:** Suggests that without knowing other commitments, we cannot determine marginal cost or benefit. Again, the decision provides enough information to infer that the marginal benefit is at least as great as the marginal cost.

The most accurate answer is **C**, as it directly reflects the reasoning behind the student's decision to study the fourth hour. 

Answer: C
