Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says that a piece of iron with a mass of 20 grams is placed in liquid air until it reaches thermal equilibrium. Then, it's quickly taken out and placed in water at 0°C. As a result, a coating of ice forms with a mass of 5.22 grams. We're given the specific heat of iron (c_iron) as 0.095 cal/g-°C and the heat of fusion of water (L) as 80 cal/g. The question is asking for the temperature of the liquid air.

Hmm, so the setup involves heat transfer. When the iron is placed in liquid air, it cools down, right? Then, when it's taken out and put into water, the iron is at a very low temperature and causes the water to freeze. The heat released by the iron as it warms up is equal to the heat absorbed by the water as it freezes, plus any heat needed to bring the water from 0°C to freezing, but wait, the water is already at 0°C. So maybe the iron's heat is used to freeze the water.

Wait, let me think. The iron is initially at the temperature of liquid air, which is way below 0°C. When it's placed in water at 0°C, the iron will absorb heat from the surroundings to warm up. But in this case, the surroundings are water at 0°C, and the iron is colder, so the heat should flow from the water to the iron, causing the water to freeze. Oh wait, no, because the iron is at a lower temperature, the water will lose heat, which would cause it to freeze. So the iron is gaining heat, and the water is losing it, turning into ice.

So the heat lost by the water (as it freezes) should equal the heat gained by the iron as it warms up. Oh wait, no, because the iron is getting heat from the water. So the heat gained by the iron (as it warms up from liquid air temp to 0°C) is equal to the heat lost by the water (as it freezes into ice at 0°C).

Wait, no. Let's clarify. The iron is at a very low temperature T. When placed in water at 0°C, heat flows from the water to the iron. So the water loses heat, which causes it to freeze. The amount of heat lost by the water is the heat used to freeze the water into ice, which is m_water * L. And that heat is gained by the iron as it warms up from T to 0°C.

So the equation would be: heat gained by iron = heat lost by water.

In formula terms: m_iron * c_iron * (T_final - T_initial) = m_water * L.

Wait, but wait. The iron is warming up from T (liquid air temp) to 0°C. So T_final is 0°C, and T_initial is T, which is much lower. So T_final - T_initial is 0 - T, which would be a positive value since T is negative.

So the equation becomes:

m_iron * c_iron * (0 - T) = m_water * L.

Wait, no, because when the iron warms up, it's absorbing heat, so the left side is positive. The right side is the heat released by the water as it freezes, which is m_water * L. So the equation is:

m_iron * c_iron * (0 - T) = m_water * L.

Wait, but wait—what about the specific heat of iron? The problem says the mean specific heat over the temperature range is 0.095 cal/g-°C. So that should be correct.

Let me write down the values:

m_iron = 20 g

c_iron = 0.095 cal/g°C

m_water = 5.22 g

L = 80 cal/g

We need to find T, the temperature of the liquid air.

Wait, but liquid air—what's its temperature? Liquid air is a mixture, primarily, but generally, the boiling point of air's main components: Nitrogen boils at -196°C, Oxygen at -183°C. But liquid air is often considered at around -190°C or similar. But that's perhaps not important here since we have to calculate it.

So, substituting into the equation:

20 g * 0.095 cal/g°C * (0 - T) = 5.22 g * 80 cal/g.

Wait, let me compute each side.

Left side: 20 * 0.095 * (0 - T) = 1.9 * (-T) cal. But since T is negative (it's in liquid air), (0-T) would be positive.

Right side: 5.22 * 80 = 417.6 cal.

So, 1.9 * (-T) = 417.6 → Wait, no, because (0 - T) is (-T), but since T is negative, (-T) is positive.

Wait, let me re-express:

Left side = 20 * 0.095 * (0 - T) → 1.9 * (0 - T) → 1.9*(-T). But T is negative, so (-T) is positive.

So the equation is 1.9 * (-T) = 417.6 → because (0 - T) is -T, and T is negative, so it's positive.

Wait, perhaps I should write the equation more accurately.

The heat gained by the iron is m * c * delta_T, where delta_T is T_final - T_initial.

In this case, T_final is 0°C, T_initial is T (a negative value). So delta_T is 0 - T = -T.

So,

m_iron * c_iron * (0 - T) = m_water * L.

So,

20 * 0.095 * (-T) = 5.22 * 80.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the signs again.

The iron is warming up, so the temperature change is positive. So (0 - T) would be a positive number because T is negative. So the left side is positive, the right side is positive.

So 20 * 0.095 * (0 - T) = 5.22 * 80.

Compute the left and right.

Left side: 20 * 0.095 = 1.9 cal/°C.

So 1.9 * (0 - T) = 5.22 * 80.

Compute right side: 5.22 *80 = 417.6 cal.

So,

1.9*(0 - T) = 417.6 → 1.9*(-T) = 417.6 → -T = 417.6 /1.9 → Let's compute that.

417.6 / 1.9 → Let's see: 1.9 * 220 = 418. So it's approximately 220, but let me compute exactly.

417.6 /1.9 = ?

Well, 19 * 220 = 4180 → 1.9 * 220 = 418.

But we have 417.6, so 1.9 * 219.789 ≈ 417.6.

Wait, perhaps exact calculation.

Compute 417.6 ÷ 1.9.

1.9 × 219 = ?

1.9 × 200 = 380.

1.9 × 19 = 36.1 → So 380 +36.1 = 416.1.

1.9 × 219.47 → Wait, perhaps better to compute 417.6 ÷ 1.9:

Divide numerator and denominator by 0.1: 4176 ÷19.

19 × 219 = 4161 → 4176 -4161=15 → 15/19=0.789.

So 219.789.

So, 1.9 * 219.789 ≈ 417.6.

So, 0 - T = 219.789 → So T = -219.789°C.

Looking at the options, let's see:

The options are:

A: -210°C

B: -190°C

C: -230°C

D: -280°C

E: -220°C

F: -260°C

G: -200°C

H: -270°C

I: -240°C

J: -250°C

Wait, our calculation gave approximately -219.79°C, which is close to -220°C. So option E is -220°C.

But wait, I should double-check the calculation for any possible errors.

Let me redo the computation to make sure.

Compute left side: 20 *0.095 = 1.9.

Right side: 5.22 *80 = 417.6.

So, 1.9 * (0 - T) = 417.6 → (0 - T) = 417.6 /1.9 = 219.789°C.

So T = -219.789°C, which is approximately -220°C. So option E.

But wait, another thought: did I get the direction of heat transfer correct?

The iron is placed into water at 0°C. The iron is colder, so heat flows from the water to the iron, causing the water to freeze. So the heat lost by the water is m_water * L, and that's equal to the heat gained by the iron, which is m_iron * c_iron * (T_final - T_initial). Since T_final is higher than T_initial (the iron is warming up), the equation is correct.

Yes, that makes sense. So T is approximately -220°C, which corresponds to option E.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the heat transfer between the iron and the water. The iron, initially at the temperature of liquid air, absorbs heat as it warms up to 0°C. This heat is equal to the heat released by the water as it freezes into ice. The equation for heat transfer is:

\[
m_{\text{iron}} \cdot c_{\text{iron}} \cdot (0 - T) = m_{\text{water}} \cdot L
\]

Where:
- \( m_{\text{iron}} = 20 \, \text{g} \)
- \( c_{\text{iron}} = 0.095 \, \text{cal/g°C} \)
- \( m_{\text{water}} = 5.22 \, \text{g} \)
- \( L = 80 \, \text{cal/g} \)
- \( T \) is the temperature of the liquid air (negative value).

Substituting the values:

\[
20 \cdot 0.095 \cdot (0 - T) = 5.22 \cdot 80
\]

First, calculate the right-hand side:

\[
5.22 \cdot 80 = 417.6 \, \text{cal}
\]

Now, simplify the left-hand side:

\[
20 \cdot 0.095 = 1.9 \, \text{cal/°C}
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
1.9 \cdot (0 - T) = 417.6
\]

Solve for \( T \):

\[
0 - T = \frac{417.6}{1.9} \quad \Rightarrow \quad T = -\frac{417.6}{1.9}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
\frac{417.6}{1.9} \approx 219.789 \quad \Rightarrow \quad T \approx -219.789°C
\]

This rounds to approximately \( T = -220°C \), which corresponds to option **E**.

**Final Answer: E**
