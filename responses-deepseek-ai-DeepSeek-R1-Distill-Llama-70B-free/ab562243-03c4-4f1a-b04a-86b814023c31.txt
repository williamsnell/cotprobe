Okay, so I need to find the pH of a 0.1 M ammonia solution, and I know the Kb is 1.76e-5. Hmm, I remember that ammonia is a weak base, so it doesn't dissociate completely in water. 

Wait, the formula I think I need is the one for weak bases. Oh right, the Kb expression is [NH4+][OH-]/[NH3] = Kb. Since it's a weak base, I can assume that the amount of NH3 that dissociates is small compared to the initial concentration. So I can make the approximation that x is much smaller than 0.1 M.

Let me set up the ICE table. The initial concentration is 0.1 M NH3. Change will be -x, and the products will be +x for NH4+ and OH-. So at equilibrium, the concentrations are [NH3] = 0.1 - x, [NH4+] = x, and [OH-] = x.

Plugging into the Kb expression: (x^2)/(0.1 - x) = 1.76e-5. Since Kb is small, x should be much smaller than 0.1, so I can approximate 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1. That simplifies the equation to x^2 / 0.1 = 1.76e-5. 

Solving for x²: x² = 1.76e-5 * 0.1 = 1.76e-6. Taking the square root, x = sqrt(1.76e-6). Let me calculate that. The square root of 1.76 is approx 1.326, so sqrt(1.76e-6) is about 1.326e-3. So x is 0.001326 M, which is the [OH-].

Now, to find pOH, I take the negative log of [OH-]. So log(1.326e-3). Let's see, log(1.326) is about 0.122, so log(1.326e-3) is 0.122 - 3 = -2.878. So pOH is 2.878.

Wait, wait, no. Because pH + pOH =14, so pH would be 14 - pOH. So pH is 14 - 2.878 = 11.122. Or wait, did I get the pOH right?

Wait, [OH-] is 1.326e-3. So pOH is -log(1.326e-3) = 2.88. So pH is 14-2.88=11.12. Looking at the options, option I is 11.12, but wait, I thought sometimes when the approximation isn't so good, maybe you need to check. Let me check the approximation. x was 0.001326, and initial concentration is 0.1. 0.001326 is about 1.3% of 0.1. So the approximation holds, so the answer should be around 11.12.

But wait, another thought. Maybe I should be using the exact quadratic equation instead of the approximation. Let me try that. The original equation is x²/(0.1 - x) = 1.76e-5. Multiply both sides by (0.1 -x): x² = 1.76e-5*(0.1 -x). Expanding that: x² = 1.76e-6 - 1.76e-5 x. Bring all terms to one side: x² + 1.76e-5 x - 1.76e-6 =0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a), where a=1, b=1.76e-5, c=-1.76e-6.

Discriminant = (1.76e-5)^2 +4*1*(1.76e-6) = (3.0976e-10) + (7.04e-6) = approx 7.04030976e-6. Square root of that is sqrt(7.04e-6) ≈ 0.00266.

So x = [ -1.76e-5 ± 0.00266 ]/(2). Taking the positive root: ( -0.0000176 + 0.00266 ) / 2 = (0.0026424)/2 = 0.0013212. So x is about 0.0013212, which is close to the approximation. So the [OH-] is 0.00132, same as before, so pH is same, 11.12.

Looking at the options, option I is 11.12. So the answer should be I.

To determine the pH of a 0.1 M ammonia (NH₃) solution with a given \( K_b = 1.76 \times 10^{-5} \), we start by recognizing that ammonia is a weak base. The dissociation of NH₃ in water can be represented as:

\[
\text{NH}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{NH}_4^+ + \text{OH}^-
\]

Using an ICE table, the equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([\text{NH}_3] = 0.1 - x\),
- \([\text{NH}_4^+] = x\),
- \([\text{OH}^-] = x\).

The expression for \( K_b \) is:

\[
K_b = \frac{[\text{NH}_4^+][\text{OH}^-]}{[\text{NH}_3]} = \frac{x^2}{0.1 - x}.
\]

Since \( K_b \) is small, we assume \( x \ll 0.1 \), so \( 0.1 - x \approx 0.1 \). Substituting this approximation:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.1}.
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.1 = (1.76 \times 10^{-5})(0.1) = 1.76 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{1.76 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 0.001326 \, \text{M}.
\]

This \( x \) represents the equilibrium concentration of \([\text{OH}^-]\). To find the pOH:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log{[\text{OH}^-]} = -\log{(0.001326)}.
\]

Breaking this into components:

\[
\log{(0.001326)} = \log{(1.326 \times 10^{-3})} = \log{(1.326)} + \log{(10^{-3})} \approx 0.122 - 3 = -2.878.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{pOH} \approx 2.878.
\]

Using the relationship \( \text{pH} + \text{pOH} = 14 \):

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 2.878 = 11.122.
\]

To verify, solving the quadratic equation without approximation yields a similar result for \( x \), confirming the validity of the assumption. Therefore, the pH of the solution is approximately **11.12**.

The correct answer is:

**I: 11.12**
