Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question says: There's an atom with one electron and atomic number Z. When light of a certain wavelength (0.1 nm) hits it, the electron gets excited from the ground state to being ionized (so it's removed from the atom). I need to find Z from the given options.

Wait, right. So this is about the photoelectric effect, I think. Or maybe ionization energy. Oh wait, because the electron is being completely removed, so it's ionization. So the energy of the incoming photon must be equal to the binding energy of the electron in the ground state.

I remember that the energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms (which have only one electron) are given by the formula E_n = - (Z² * R_H) / n². Where R_H is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen, approximately 13.6 eV. Oh wait, but wait—when the electron is in the ground state, n is 1, right? So E_1 = -Z² * R_H.

But wait, the ionization energy is the energy required to remove the electron from the ground state to infinity, which would be the absolute value of E_1. So the ionization energy is Z² * R_H.

Now, the photon's energy needs to provide exactly this ionization energy. The energy of a photon is given by E_photon = h * c / λ, where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light, and λ the wavelength.

Wait, but the wavelength given is 0.1 nm. Let me convert that to meters. 0.1 nm is 0.1e-9 meters, which is 1e-10 m.

So plugging into E_photon: h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is about 3e8 m/s.

Calculating E_photon: (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1e-10 m) = let's see, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = approx 1.9878e-25, divided by 1e-10 gives 1.9878e-15 J.

Wait, but I need to convert that energy into electron volts because the Rydberg constant is in eV. I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So E_photon in eV would be (1.9878e-15 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ let me calculate that.

1.9878e-15 / 1.602e-19 = approximately (1.9878 / 1.602) * 1e4 → around 1.24 * 1e4 = 12400 eV? Wait, that seems really high. Wait, 0.1 nm is in the X-ray range, so the energy is high.

Wait, but wait another thing. If the photon's energy is 12400 eV, that's way higher than typical ionization energies. For example, hydrogen's ionization energy is 13.6 eV. So if the atom here requires 12400 eV to ionize, that would mean Z² * 13.6 eV = 12400 eV. Let me write that equation.

Z² * 13.6 eV = 12400 eV → Z² = 12400 / 13.6. Let me compute that.

12400 divided by 13.6. Let's see, 13.6 times 900 is 12240. So 900 is about 12240. 12400-12240=160. 160/13.6 is about 11.76. So total is approximately 900 +11.76=911.76. So Z squared is approximately 912. So Z is the square root of 912.

What's sqrt(900)=30. So sqrt(912)= about 30.2. Hmm, but wait, the options given are all integers. So looking at the options, perhaps the closest is 30, but let me check.

Wait, wait a second. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate E_photon more accurately.

So E_photon = hc/(λ). Let me compute each step.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value, but approx 6.626e-34)
c = 299792458 m/s, but approx 3e8 m/s for simplicity.
λ = 0.1 nm = 0.1e-9 m = 1e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1e-10) = (1.9878e-25) / 1e-10 = 1.9878e-15 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J. So E_photon = 1.9878e-15 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ let me compute this.

Dividing 1.9878e-15 by 1.602e-19: Let's compute 1.9878 / 1.602 ≈ 1.2415. Then the exponents: 1e-15 / 1e-19 = 1e4. So 1.2415 * 1e4 = 12415 eV.

So approximately 12415 eV.

Now, the ionization energy is Z² * 13.6 eV = 12415 eV.

So Z² = 12415 /13.6 ≈ let's compute that.

13.6 * 912 = let's see: 13 * 900 = 11700, 0.6 * 900=540 → 11700+540=12240. 13.6*912=12240 + (13.6*12)=163.2 → total 12403.2. Close to 12415.

So 912 *13.6=12403.2 eV. But our E_photon is 12415. So 12415 /13.6 ≈ 912.87. So Z²≈912.87 → Z≈sqrt(912.87). Let me calculate that.

Wait, 30^2 is 900, 31^2 is 961. So 912.87 is between 30 and 31. Let me see: 30.2^2 = (30 +0.2)^2=900 + 2*30*0.2 +0.2^2=900+12+0.04=912.04. So 30.2^2=912.04. Oh, that's very close to our computed Z² of 912.87. So Z≈30.2. But the options are all integers, so looking for Z≈30.2 → the closest integer is 30. But wait, none of the options are 30; option A is 30 protons, which is Z=30. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are from A to J. The options are:

A:30, B:25, C:55, D:45, E:50, F:60, G:40, H:10, I:35, J:20.

So option A is 30 protons, which would make Z=30. But wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check my math because the initial photon energy calculation might be wrong. Because I'm getting a Z of approximately 30.2, which would correspond to Z=30, but if the options have 30, then that's the answer. But wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the hydrogen-like formula.

Wait, the energy levels for hydrogen-like atoms (one electron) are E_n = -13.6 eV * Z² / n². So the ionization energy is 13.6*Z² eV. That's correct. So when the photon provides energy equal to the ionization energy, the electron is just removed. So E_photon must be equal to 13.6*Z² eV.

Wait, but wait: when you ionize, the electron goes from n=1 (ground state) to n=infinity, so ΔE = E_infinity - E_1 = 0 - (-13.6 Z²) = 13.6 Z² eV. So yes, that's correct.

So E_photon = 13.6 Z² eV.

Wait wait, but earlier I calculated E_photon as approximately 12415 eV. So 13.6 Z² = 12415 → Z²=12415/13.6 ≈ 912.87, so Z≈30.2.

Looking back at the options, option A is 30 protons. So the answer should be A:30 protons.

But wait, let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the photon energy calculation. Because 0.1 nm is 10^-10 meters. Oh wait, another way to calculate the energy: 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, right? And I remember that 1 Angstrom is about 10 eV for photon energy? Wait no, wait. The conversion is that 12400 eV corresponds to about 1 Angstrom? Because λ (in Angstroms) * Energy (eV) ≈ 12400. So 0.1 nm is 1 Angstrom. So 12400 eV * 1 Angstrom → so photon energy is 12400 eV. So that supports the earlier calculation.

So then Z² = 12400 /13.6 ≈ 912 → Z=30.2. So Z=30.

Wait, but option A is 30 protons. So the correct answer should be A. So why is the given options including J:20, etc. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: perhaps using the Rydberg formula for the ionization.

The Rydberg constant is about 1.097e7 m^-1. The Rydberg energy is approximately 13.6 eV.

The energy required for ionization is Z² * 13.6 eV. The photon energy is hc/(lambda) → 12400 eV * (1e-9 m / lambda in meters). Wait, another approach: 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J, and the wavelength in meters is 1e-10 m.

Wait, alternatively, using the formula E = (hc)/(lambda). Let me plug in the constants correctly.

h=6.626e-34 J·s
c=3e8 m/s
lambda=1e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1e-10 = (6.626*3)/(1e-34+8-10) → Let me compute the denominator exponents correctly: 1e-34 (from h) * 1e8 (from c) → 1e-26. Then divided by 1e-10 → 1e-26 / 1e-10 = 1e-16.

So 6.626 *3 = 19.878 → 19.878e-16 J. That's 1.9878e-15 J.

Convert to eV: 1eV=1.6e-19 J.

So 1.9878e-15 / 1.6e-19 = (1.9878/1.6) * 1e4 → approx 1.242 * 1e4 → 12420 eV.

So that's correct, and the same as before.

So Z² =12420 /13.6 ≈ 913. So Z≈30.22.

Looking back at options, the only option near 30 is A:30.

Wait, but some of the other options are higher. Did I make a mistake in units? Let me check the wavelength again. The given wavelength is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 m, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I confused nm with Angstroms. 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 0.1 nm is indeed 1 Angstrom.

Wait, but perhaps the formula I used is wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should use the Rydberg formula for the energy levels. Let me think.

The Rydberg formula gives the wavelength emitted when an electron transitions between energy levels. But in this case, we're dealing with ionization. So using the energy approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the energy is in the correct units. Wait, 12400 eV is a lot. For example, for hydrogen (Z=1), 13.6 eV is the ionization energy. So for Z=30, it's 30² *13.6 = 900 *13.6= 12240 eV. That's close to our calculated 12420 eV, which would make sense if the exact calculation is considered.

So, the Z that makes 13.6 Z² = 12420 → Z²=12420/13.6= 913 → Z=30.216... which is approximately 30.22. So the closest integer is 30. Hence, option A (30 protons) is the answer.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 30 protons, which is exactly Z=30.

Wait, but some of the other options are higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me see.

Wait, let me compute 12400/13.6. Let me do this accurately:

13.6 * 900 = 12240
13.6 * 910 = 13.6*(900+10)=12240 +136=12376
13.6 * 912=12376 + (13.6*2)=12376+27.2=12403.2

So 13.6*912=12403.2 eV. So to reach 12415 eV, we'd need Z squared to be 12415/13.6= approximately 912.87, so Z≈30.216.

But since Z must be an integer, the closest is 30. So option A is correct.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 30, which is correct. So the answer should be A.

To determine the atomic number \( Z \) of the atom, we analyze the problem as follows:

The atom has one electron, making it hydrogen-like. The energy required to ionize the electron from the ground state (n=1) to infinity is given by the ionization energy formula:

\[
E_{\text{ionization}} = Z^2 \cdot E_1
\]

where \( E_1 = 13.6 \, \text{eV} \) is the ground-state energy of hydrogen. Thus:

\[
E_{\text{ionization}} = Z^2 \cdot 13.6 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The energy of the incident photon is related to its wavelength \( \lambda \) by:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1 \times 10^{-10}} = 1.9878 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-15}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 12415 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Equating the photon energy to the ionization energy:

\[
Z^2 \cdot 13.6 = 12415.
\]

Solving for \( Z^2 \):

\[
Z^2 = \frac{12415}{13.6} \approx 912.87.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
Z \approx \sqrt{912.87} \approx 30.22.
\]

Since \( Z \) must be an integer, the closest value is \( Z = 30 \). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A: 30 protons.**
