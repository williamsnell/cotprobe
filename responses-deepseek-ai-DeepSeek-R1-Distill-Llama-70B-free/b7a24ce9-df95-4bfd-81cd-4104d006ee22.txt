Question:

In an experiment designed to study the photoelectric effect, it is observed that low-intensity visible light of wavelength 550 nm produced no photoelectrons. Which of the following best describes what would occur if the intensity of this light were increased dramatically?

Options:

A: The metal would start to heat up due to increased light intensity.
B: The light would start producing photoelectrons with a kinetic energy equal to the energy of the incident photons plus the work function of the metal.
C: The light would change color due to increased intensity.
D: The wavelength of the light would decrease due to increased intensity.
E: After several seconds, necessary for the electrons to absorb sufficient energy from the incident light, photoelectrons would be produced with a kinetic energy equal to the energy of the incident photons minus the work function of the metal.
F: Nothing would happen.
G: Almost immediately, photoelectrons would be produced with a kinetic energy equal to the energy of the incident photons.
H: Photoelectrons would be produced with a kinetic energy equal to twice the energy of the incident photons.
I: Almost immediately, photoelectrons would be produced with a kinetic energy equal to the energy of the incident photons minus the work function of the metal.
J: The light would start producing photoelectrons with a kinetic energy less than the energy of the incident photons minus the work function of the metal.

Okay, so I've got this physics question about the photoelectric effect. Hmm, I remember that the photoelectric effect has to do with light hitting a metal surface and causing electrons to be emitted. But wait, what are the key points again?

The question says that low-intensity visible light with a wavelength of 550 nm doesn't produce any photoelectrons. And then they're asking what happens if we increase the intensity of this light dramatically. The options are from A to J.

I think I should start by recalling Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect. Oh right, the main idea is that the energy of the incoming photons must be at least equal to the work function of the metal for electrons to be emitted. The work function is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron from the metal's surface.

So the work function (usually denoted by φ) is a property of the metal. If the photon's energy is less than φ, no electrons are emitted, no matter how intense the light is. Because each photon's energy is what matters, not the total intensity. Wait, wait—intensity relates to how many photons are hitting the surface. High intensity means more photons, but each individual photon still has the same energy.

In the question, low-intensity light of 550 nm doesn't produce any electrons. So the photon energy must be below the work function. Let me think about the energy of a photon. The energy E is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Calculating that for 550 nm: let's see, h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (550e-9 m). Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 is approximately 1.9878e-25. Divide by 550e-9 (which is 5.5e-7 m) so 1.9878e-25 /5.5e-7 ≈ 3.615e-19 J per photon. Converting that to electron volts, since 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 3.615e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.256 eV.

Wait, but the work function of metals varies. For example, metals like cesium have a low work function around 2 eV, but others like iron are higher, around 4.5 eV. So if the photon energy is 2.256 eV and the metal's work function is higher than this, say 3 eV, then even with higher intensity, no electrons would be emitted because each photon doesn't have enough energy.

But in the question, they're increasing the intensity. So if the initial setup had no electrons because the photon energy was less than the work function, increasing intensity just means more photons hitting. But since each photon's energy is still the same, it can't overcome the work function. So no photoelectrons would be produced even with higher intensity.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me read through them carefully.

Option F says nothing would happen. That's what I'm thinking because the intensity doesn't affect whether electrons are emitted if each photon's energy is below the work function.

Other options: Option E says after a delay, electrons are produced. But that's the old notion before Einstein, where it was thought that electrons needed time to absorb energy. But Einstein's model says it's an all-or-nothing process. Each photon either has enough energy or not. So E is incorrect.

Option I says photoelectrons are produced with KE equal to photon energy minus work function. But that would require the photon energy to be higher than the work function. Since the initial setup didn't produce electrons, the photon energy must be below work function, so I isn't correct.

Option F is the right choice. So the answer is F.

In the photoelectric effect, the energy of individual photons determines whether photoelectrons are emitted, not the intensity of the light. The energy of a photon is given by \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light. For a wavelength of 550 nm, the photon energy is approximately 2.256 eV. If the work function (\( \phi \)) of the metal is greater than this value, no photoelectrons will be emitted, regardless of the light's intensity.

Increasing the intensity of the light only increases the number of photons hitting the surface but does not change the energy of individual photons. Since the photon energy is already below the work function, no electrons will be emitted even with a dramatic increase in intensity. This aligns with Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect, which states that emission occurs only if the photon energy is at least equal to the work function.

Option F correctly states that nothing would happen because the photon energy remains insufficient to overcome the work function, even with increased intensity.

Answer: F
