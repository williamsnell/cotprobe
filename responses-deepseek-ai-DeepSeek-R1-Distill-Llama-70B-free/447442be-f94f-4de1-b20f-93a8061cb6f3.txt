Okay, so I need to answer this question about the estimated number of human protein-coding genes. Hmm, I remember that the human genome was a big topic in biology class. From what I learned, the Human Genome Project found that there are around 20,000 to 25,000 protein-coding genes. But wait, the options don't exactly have 20,000–25,000. Let me check the options again.

The options are A through J. Option A is 29,000–30,000, which is a bit higher than what I remember. Option E is 19,000–20,000, which is close to the lower end of what I recall. So I'm a bit confused. Maybe the estimate has changed over time. I think initially people thought there might be as many as 100,000 genes, but after the Human Genome Project, the number was much lower.

Wait, I remember reading that the current estimate is about 19,000 to 20,000. So Option E would be correct. But wait, there's also Option A which is 29,000–30,000. Why is that? Maybe some sources include more genes that were thought to be protein-coding but later found not to be? Or perhaps recent studies have adjusted the numbers again.

I should think about the timeline. The initial estimates before the Human Genome Project were higher, like around 100,000 (Option G), but after sequencing, it was found to be much lower. So the correct answer is likely E, 19,000–20,000. But wait, I also remember that some sources say approximately 20,000–25,000. So why isn't that an option? Oh, looking back, Option A is 29k-30k, which is higher than that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering all the possible estimates, including some older ones. But the question says that the estimate may be reduced over time. So if the initial estimate was higher and now it's lower, the correct current estimate would be lower. So perhaps the current estimate is around 19k–20k, which is Option E.

Wait, but I'm a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The initial estimate was around 100k, but genome sequencing showed it's about 20k. So the current estimate is lower, and the question says the estimate may be reduced over time. So it's probably talking about the current estimate being around 20k, but if the option is 19k–20k (E), then that's the choice.

Alternatively, I might be confusing with the number of genes that include non-coding. No, the question specifically says protein-coding. So I think Option E is the correct answer.

The current estimate of human protein-coding genes is around 19,000–20,000, based on findings from the Human Genome Project and subsequent research. Early estimates were much higher, around 100,000, but advances in genome sequencing have significantly reduced this number. While some sources might suggest slightly higher estimates, the most accurate and widely accepted range is 19,000–20,000. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: 19,000–20,000

Answer: E
