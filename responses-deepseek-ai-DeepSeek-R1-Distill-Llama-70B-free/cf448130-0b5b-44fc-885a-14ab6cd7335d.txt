Okay, so I've got this question about Lissajous patterns on an oscilloscope. Hmm, I remember that Lissajous figures are formed by the combination of two sinusoidal signals, one controlling the horizontal movement and the other the vertical. The pattern that results can tell us something about the frequencies of these signals.

The question says the pattern has 5 horizontal tangencies and 2 vertical tangencies. Wait, what's a tangency? Oh right, tangency points are where the curve just touches the edges of the figure. For a Lissajous figure, the number of horizontal and vertical tangents relates to the ratio of the frequencies.

I think the formula for the number of horizontal (H) and vertical (V) tangents is when the two signals are not integer multiples of each other. But wait, no, when they are in a ratio of small integers, the pattern repeats and you get a certain number of tangents. Oh right, the number of horizontal tangents is given by (m-1), and vertical by (n-1), where m and n are the ratios of the frequencies. Or was it the other way around?

Wait, let me think. Suppose the horizontal frequency is f_h and vertical is f_v. The ratio f_v/f_h is m/n where m and n are integers with no common factors. Then, the number of horizontal tangents is m-1 and vertical is n-1. Or wait, maybe it's the number of horizontal nodes (points where the curve crosses the center line) that's related. Oh wait, no, the nodes are different. Let me get this straight.

I remember that in a Lissajous figure, if the ratio is a/b (a and b being co-prime), the number of horizontal tangents is a-1 and vertical is b-1. Or is it the other way around? Or perhaps it's the number of lobes. Wait, no, the number of lobes is related too. Oh, right, the total number of lobes is given by the sum when the ratio is in the form of a fraction reduced to simplest terms.

Wait, another approach: the number of horizontal tangents is (m-1), where m is the number of times the horizontal signal completes a cycle compared to the vertical. So if f_v / f_h = m/n (in reduced terms), then the number of horizontal tangents is m-1 and vertical is n-1. Or maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, let's take an example. If the horizontal frequency is f and the vertical is 2f, so the ratio is 1:2. Then, the number of horizontal tangents would be 2-1 =1 and vertical is 1-1=0? That doesn't make sense. Or maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, another way: the number of horizontal tangents is equal to the number of vertical maxima minus one. Or perhaps it's the number of times the curve touches the extreme left and right points. Alternatively, the number of horizontal tangents indicates how many times the curve just touches the horizontal extremes.

Wait, looking for a formula. I think the number of horizontal tangents (H) is given by (m-1), and the number of vertical tangents (V) is (n-1), where the frequency ratio is m:n, in the simplest terms.

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think: If the horizontal frequency is higher than the vertical, then the Lissajous figure would have more horizontal lobes. Or wait, the number of horizontal lobes is determined by the vertical frequency, and vice versa.

Alternatively, the number of horizontal tangents is m-1, and vertical is n-1, where m is the number of times the vertical signal oscillates compared to the horizontal. So the ratio is m:n, where m is f_v over f_h.

So in this problem: H =5, V=2.

So, H= m-1 → m =6.

V =n-1 →n=3.

So the ratio f_v / f_h = m/n =6/3=2. So f_v =2*f_h.

Wait, but wait, the horizontal frequency is given as 100 Hz. So f_v would be 2*100=200 Hz.

But wait, looking at the options, G is 200 Hz. So is that the answer?

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes the formula is H = (m-1) and V=(n-1), where the ratio is m:n.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the number of horizontal and vertical tangents in a Lissajous figure is:

Number of horizontal tangents = (p -1), where p is the ratio of the vertical frequency to the horizontal frequency, when the ratio is expressed as a fraction in its simplest form (p/q, p and q coprime).

Similarly, the number of vertical tangents is (q -1).

Wait, that would mean that if the number of horizontal tangents is H and vertical is V, then:

H = p-1 → p = H+1.

V = q-1 → q = V+1.

The ratio of frequencies (f_v/f_h) is p/q.

So in this problem, H=5, V=2.

So p =5+1=6.

q=2+1=3.

So ratio f_v/f_h =6/3=2.

Thus, f_v=2*f_h.

Given that f_h is 100Hz, so f_v=200Hz.

Looking at the options: G is 200 Hz.

So the answer should be G.

Wait, but another possibility: I might have the ratio reversed. What if the ratio is f_h/f_v instead?

Wait, no, because in the formula, H is based on p, which is f_v/f_h. If I get that wrong, I might reverse.

Alternative approach: Let me think of another example. Suppose f_h=1Hz, f_v=2Hz. So ratio is 2/1.

Then, the number of horizontal tangents is p-1=2-1=1.

Number of vertical tangents is q-1=1-1=0. Hmm, but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that when the vertical frequency is a multiple of the horizontal, the number of horizontal tangents is (m-1) where m is the multiple. If f_v = m*f_h, then H = m-1. Similarly, if f_h is a multiple of f_v, then V = n-1, where n is the multiple.

Wait, let me think of a standard case. For example, a 1:2 ratio (f_v is twice f_h). So imagine f_h is 1kHz, f_v is 2kHz. So the Lissajous figure would have 2 horizontal lobes and 1 vertical lobe? Or maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, another way: the number of horizontal tangents is (f_v / f_h) -1, provided f_v is a multiple of f_h. Similarly, the number of vertical tangents is (f_h / f_v) -1, but only if f_h is a multiple of f_v. Otherwise, if the ratio is not integer, you get a complicated pattern without tangents.

Wait, but in this question, the frequencies are such that the ratio is rational, so the pattern has a finite number of tangents.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is the number of horizontal tangents is (m-1) and vertical is (n-1), where m and n are the numerator and denominator when the ratio of f_v to f_h is expressed as m/n in simplest terms.

In this problem, H=5, V=2 → m=6, n=3 → f_v/f_h =6/3=2 → f_v=200Hz.

So the correct answer is G:200 Hz.

To determine the vertical frequency based on the given Lissajous pattern, we analyze the relationship between the number of horizontal and vertical tangents and the frequency ratio. The number of horizontal tangents (\(H\)) and vertical tangents (\(V\)) in a Lissajous figure is related to the frequency ratio of the vertical (\(f_v\)) and horizontal (\(f_h\)) signals. Specifically:

- The number of horizontal tangents is given by \(H = m - 1\), where \(m\) is the numerator of the frequency ratio expressed in simplest terms (\(f_v / f_h = m/n\)).
- The number of vertical tangents is given by \(V = n - 1\), where \(n\) is the denominator of the frequency ratio.

In this problem:
- The number of horizontal tangents is \(H = 5\), so \(m = H + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6\).
- The number of vertical tangents is \(V = 2\), so \(n = V + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3\).

Thus, the frequency ratio is:
\[
\frac{f_v}{f_h} = \frac{m}{n} = \frac{6}{3} = 2
\]

Given that the horizontal frequency is \(f_h = 100 \, \text{Hz}\), the vertical frequency is:
\[
f_v = 2 \cdot f_h = 2 \cdot 100 = 200 \, \text{Hz}
\]

From the options provided, the vertical frequency corresponds to **G: 200 Hz**.
