Question:

A defendant was angry at his friend for marrying the defendant's former girlfriend. As the friend was painting his house one afternoon, the defendant fired a shot from his gun at him. Although the shot missed the friend, the bullet struck and killed the friend's daughter. The defendant is subsequently charged with the first-degree murder of the daughter. The relevant statutes in effect in this jurisdiction are as follows:Section 169: Murder in the first degree is the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought. Section 170: Malice is expressed when there is manifested a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. Which of the following, if established, would provide the defendant with his best defense?

Options:

A: The gun discharged accidentally.
B: The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.
C: He was under the influence of alcohol at the time.
D: The bullet was deflected and did not hit the intended target.
E: He was acting out of anger and not with a deliberate intention.
F: He did not intend to kill anyone, only to scare the friend.
G: He intended only to wound the friend.
H: He was unaware of the elements of malice.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically first-degree murder. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.

The scenario is that a defendant is angry at his friend for marrying his ex-girlfriend. One afternoon, the friend is painting his house, and the defendant shoots at him. The shot misses the friend but hits and kills the friend's daughter. The defendant is charged with first-degree murder of the daughter.

Looking at the statutes provided:
- Section 169 defines first-degree murder as the unlawful and intentional killing of a human being with malice aforethought.
- Section 170 says malice is expressed when there's a deliberate intention to take away another's life.

So the key here is understanding what elements the prosecution must prove and what defenses the defendant might have.

The question asks which established fact would provide the defendant's best defense. The options are A through H.

First, I need to break down the elements of first-degree murder as per the statutes. It requires an unlawful and intentional killing with malice aforethought. Malice, under Section 170, is expressed when there's a deliberate intention to kill.

In this case, the defendant shot at his friend but missed and killed the daughter. So the intended target was the friend, not the daughter. 

I remember that in criminal law, when a defendant intends to kill one person but accidentally kills another, the doctrine of transferred intent might apply. Transferred intent means that the intent to kill the intended victim is "transferred" to the actual victim. So the defendant's intent to kill the friend would satisfy the malice requirement for the murder of the daughter. But wait, if the killing was intentional, then malice is present.

Wait, but the question is about the defendant's best defense. So we need to find a factor that would negate one of the required elements of the crime.

Looking at the options:

A: The gun discharged accidentally. If it was an accident, that might negate intent. But the defendant was firing the gun, so it's possible this could be an accident, but I'm not sure if that applies here. If the discharge was accidental, maybe it's involuntary manslaughter, but I'm not certain.

B: The killing was due to negligence in missing the friend. Negligence is about carelessness, but first-degree murder requires intentional killing. If it was just negligence, maybe it's a different charge, like manslaughter. But I think the intent to kill the friend would still transfer, making it murder.

C: He was under the influence of alcohol. Voluntary intoxication can sometimes negate specific intent, but first-degree murder requires malice, which is a deliberate intention. I'm not sure if being drunk would help here, but some jurisdictions don't allow intoxication to negate malice. So this might not be the best defense.

D: The bullet was deflected and didn't hit the intended target. This sounds like it's explaining how the daughter was killed, but the intent was still to kill the friend. So transferred intent would still apply. This doesn't seem like a defense.

E: He was acting out of anger and not with a deliberate intention. Wait, if he acted out of anger but still intended to kill, then malice is present. But if he wasn't deliberate, maybe it's a heat of passion scenario. However, heat of passion usually reduces murder to manslaughter, but only if it's a provocation that would cause a reasonable person to act rashly. The defendant's friend marrying his ex might not qualify as adequate provocation. Plus, the killing was intentional, so this might not help.

F: He didn't intend to kill anyone, only to scare the friend. If he only intended to scare, that would mean he didn't have the specific intent to kill. But firing a gun at someone usually shows an intent to kill or at least cause serious harm. But if he claims he only wanted to scare, maybe the intent wasn't there. However, in this case, he fired a shot, which could imply intent to kill. So this might not hold up.

G: He intended only to wound the friend. If he only intended to wound, then maybe he didn't have the intent to kill. But under transferred intent, if he intended to wound the friend but killed the daughter, would that still count as murder? Or would it reduce the charge? Alternatively, if the intent was not to kill, then malice aforethought might not be present. Wait, but Section 170 says malice is expressed when there's a deliberate intention to take a life. So if he intended to wound, not kill, then maybe malice isn't present. That could negate the malice required for first-degree murder.

H: He was unaware of the elements of malice. Ignorance of the law generally isn't a defense. So this probably doesn't help.

So now I'm thinking about the options. The defendant's best defense would be something that negates the malice aforethought or the intent required.

Option F says he didn't intend to kill, only to scare. But if he shot at the friend, that's an act that could lead to death, so it's possible that the court would infer intent to kill. So maybe F isn't the strongest.

Option G says he intended only to wound. If he intended to wound, then under the doctrine of transferred intent, the intent to wound the friend would transfer to the daughter, but would that be enough for murder? Or would it be assault or something else.

Wait, the charge is first-degree murder, which requires malice aforethought, i.e., deliberate intention to kill. If he only intended to wound, then he didn't have the specific intent to kill. So the malice element might not be satisfied. That could mean the killing wasn't murder but maybe manslaughter or another offense.

Alternatively, if he intended to wound the friend but caused death, under some doctrines, that might still be murder if the act was inherently dangerous. But I'm not sure. Wait, in this case, the killing was intentional in the sense that he aimed and shot, but the intent was only to wound. So perhaps the malice is not expressed because there's no deliberate intention to kill.

Wait, Section 170 says malice is expressed when there's a deliberate intention to take a life. So if he didn't have that, then malice isn't expressed. Therefore, first-degree murder isn't applicable. So Option G could be a good defense.

But wait, another angle: transferred intent applies when the intent to kill is directed at one person, but the harm is done to another. So if he intended to kill the friend, but killed the daughter, then transferred intent makes him guilty of murder. But if he only intended to wound the friend, then the intent to wound transfers, making him guilty of assault or battery, but not murder.

So in this case, if the defendant intended only to wound the friend, then the transferred intent would be to wound the daughter, not kill her. Therefore, the killing would not be intentional, which is required for first-degree murder.

But wait, the daughter died as a result. So if the intent was to wound, but the act resulted in death, then even if transferred, the intent was not to kill. So the malice element (intent to kill) isn't present. Therefore, the defendant couldn't be convicted of first-degree murder.

So among the options, G seems like a good choice. Alternatively, Option F says he only intended to scare, which is a lower intent. But I'm not sure if that's more plausible than G.

Another thought: If the defendant intended to scare, that might be considered reckless conduct rather than intentional. But firing a gun at someone is a pretty extreme way to scare and could be seen as intent to kill. So maybe Option G is better because it's about the specific intent to wound, not kill.

So putting it all together, the best defense would be that he intended only to wound the friend, which would negate the malice aforethought required for first-degree murder.

To determine the defendant's best defense, we must analyze the elements of first-degree murder under the given statutes and evaluate how each option could negate those elements. 

First-degree murder requires an unlawful and intentional killing with malice aforethought, which is defined as a deliberate intention to take away the life of another. The defendant shot at his friend but missed and killed the friend's daughter. Under the doctrine of transferred intent, the intent to kill the friend would generally transfer to the daughter, satisfying the malice requirement for murder. However, the question asks for the best defense, so we need to identify a factor that could negate the required elements of the crime.

### Analysis of the Options:

- **A: The gun discharged accidentally.**  
   If the gun discharged accidentally, this could negate intent. However, the defendant was firing the gun, so it is unlikely to be considered an accident. This is not the strongest defense.

- **B: The killing was the result of negligence in missing the friend.**  
   Negligence involves carelessness, but first-degree murder requires intentional killing. The intent to kill the friend would still transfer to the daughter under transferred intent, making this option ineffective as a defense.

- **C: He was under the influence of alcohol at the time.**  
   Voluntary intoxication can sometimes negate specific intent, but malice requires a deliberate intention to kill. In many jurisdictions, intoxication does not negate malice, so this is not a strong defense.

- **D: The bullet was deflected and did not hit the intended target.**  
   This explains how the daughter was killed but does not negate the intent to kill the friend. Transferred intent would still apply, so this is not a viable defense.

- **E: He was acting out of anger and not with a deliberate intention.**  
   Acting out of anger might suggest heat of passion, which could reduce murder to manslaughter. However, heat of passion requires adequate provocation, which marrying his ex-girlfriend may not constitute. Additionally, the killing was intentional, so this is unlikely to succeed.

- **F: He did not intend to kill anyone, only to scare the friend.**  
   If the defendant only intended to scare the friend, this could negate the intent to kill. However, firing a gun at someone typically implies an intent to kill or cause serious harm, making this defense less plausible.

- **G: He intended only to wound the friend.**  
   If the defendant intended only to wound the friend, he lacked the specific intent to kill. Malice aforethought requires a deliberate intention to take a life, which would not be present in this case. Transferred intent would apply, but the intent to wound would not satisfy the malice requirement for first-degree murder. This is the strongest defense.

- **H: He was unaware of the elements of malice.**  
   Ignorance of the law is generally not a defense, so this option is ineffective.

### Conclusion:  
The defendant's best defense is that he intended only to wound the friend, as this negates the malice aforethought required for first-degree murder.
