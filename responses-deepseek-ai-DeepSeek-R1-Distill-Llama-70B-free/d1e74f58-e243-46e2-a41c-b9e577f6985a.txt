Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about blackbody radiation and the wavelength at which the spectral emittance is maximum for different temperatures. Hmm, I remember that this is related to something called Wien's Law. Let me try to think through this.

So, Wien's Displacement Law says that the wavelength of maximum emission is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of the blackbody. The formula is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. I think the value of b is approximately 2.8977719 × 10^-3 m·K. Right, so the units are meters times Kelvin.

Wait, but the options are given in micrometers (mμ), which is microns, right? Oh, right, 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters. So, I need to make sure I convert units correctly when plugging in the numbers.

Alright, let's tackle each part of the question step by step.

Part a) asks for the maximum wavelength when the temperature is 500 K. So using Wien's Law, lambda_max = (2.89777e-3 m·K) / 500 K. Let me compute that. 

2.89777e-3 divided by 500 is... let's see. 2.89777e-3 is 0.00289777. Dividing by 500: 0.00289777 / 500 = approx 5.7954e-6 meters. Oh wait, since 1e-6 meters is 1 micrometer, that's 5.7954 micrometers. So about 5.8 micrometers. Looking at the options, let's see which ones have close values for a).

Looking at the options:

Option C: a) 579 mμ. Wait, that's 579,000 micrometers, which is 579 mm. That's way too big. No, that's not right. Option B: a) 800 mμ. That's 800 micrometers, which is 0.8 mm. Hmm, but my calculation was 5.8 micrometers. So 5.8 is way smaller than 800. So none of the options seem to match that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Oh wait, I think I messed up the exponent when converting. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 2.89777e-3 m is 0.00289777 meters. Divided by 500 K gives 0.00289777 / 500 = 0.0000057954 meters. To convert to micrometers, multiply by 1e6, so 5.7954 micrometers, which is about 5.8 mμ. So the correct answer for part a) is approximately 5.8 micrometers. But looking at the options, none of the a) choices seem to match that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I confused the letters. Wait, let's look again. Oh wait, option I has a) 5794 mμ, which is 5.794 mm. That's way bigger than 5.8 mμ. No, that's not it. Option G: a) 1000 mμ. Nope. Option C: a)579 mμ, which is 579 micrometers, way higher than 5.8. So, that's confusing. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, did I use the right formula? Oh wait, maybe I mixed up wavelength and frequency? No, I don't think so. Wien's Law is about wavelength. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the form lambda_max in micrometers equals 28977 divided by temperature in Kelvin. Oh yeah, because 2.89777e-3 m·K is 2897.77e-6 m·K, so in micrometers, it's 2897.77 micrometers·K / K. So lambda_max (in micrometers) = 2898 / T.

So for 500 K, lambda_max = 2898 / 500 = 5.796 micrometers. So about 5.8 micrometers. But none of the options for a) are close to that. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the options? Let me check the options again.

Looking at option C: a) 579 mμ, which is 579,000 micrometers, that's 579 mm. No, that's way off. Option I: a) 5794 mμ, which is 5.794 mm. Wait, that's 5794 micrometers, which is 5.794 mm. But 5.794 mm is way larger than 5.8 micrometers. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first part is for 5000 K? Let's see part b) is 5000 K. So for part b), lambda_max is 2898 / 5000 = approx 0.5796 micrometers, which is 579.6 nanometers (since 1 micrometer is 1000 nm). Wait, but the options for part b) are in micrometers. Let's see option C: b)5794 mμ. That's 5.794 mm, which is way too big. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe I should go through each option and calculate for both parts a) and b), and see which option matches.

Let's think about the options that have correct values for a) and b). For example, option C: a)579 mμ, b)5794 mμ.

Wait, for a temperature of 500 K, 2898 /500 =5.796 mμ. So option C's a) is 579 mμ, which is way larger. So that can't be right. 

Option I: a)5794 mμ, which is 5.794 mm. That's way too big for 500 K, which should be about 5.8 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, another version I've heard is that lambda_max (in angstroms) is approximately 0.29 / T (in micrometers?) No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula.

Wait, the correct formula is lambda_max (in meters) = (2.8977719e-3 m·K) / T. So for T in Kelvin, lambda in meters. So when T is 500 K, lambda_max is about 5.795e-6 meters, which is 5.795 micrometers.

Looking at the options, none of the a) options are 5.8 mμ. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different form of the law, like using nanometers? No, the question uses micrometers.

Wait, another approach: let's see which options make sense when considering typical temperatures and their max wavelengths. For example, humans at about 300 K emit mostly in the infrared, which is a few micrometers. The sun, at around 5800 K, emits at about 500 nm (0.5 micrometers), which is in the visible range.

Wait, part a) is 500 K. So the peak should be in the infrared, a few micrometers. So let's see which options' a) is around 5-6 micrometers.

Looking at the options, option I: a)5794 mμ. That's 5.794 mm, way too long. Option G: a)1000 mμ (1 mm), no. Option B: a)800 mμ (0.8 mm), no. Option C: a)579 mμ (0.579 mm), no.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different constant or I'm making a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the options are in nanometers? Because 5.8 micrometers is 5800 nanometers, so 580 nm is 5800 nm? No, 1 micrometer is 1000 nm, so 5.8 micrometers is 5800 nm. Wait, but 580 nm is 0.58 micrometers.

Wait, let me check the value of Wien's displacement constant again. Oh wait, I think I might have confused the form. Oh wait, the displacement constant in micrometers·Kelvin is 2898. So lambda_max (micrometers) = 2898 / T.

So for T=500K, lambda_max =2898/500=5.796 micrometers. So about 5.8 micrometers. Hmm. So none of the options have a) at 5.8. So perhaps I'm missing something, or maybe the options are incorrect, or perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different form, like nm instead of micrometers? Let me check. If I calculate in nm, 5.8 micrometers is 5800 nm. But none of the options have that either. 

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is using the inverse formula. Oh wait, no, the formula is lambda_max = b/T, not T = b/lambda_max. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps let's look at part c) first. Part c) asks at what temperature the maximum spectral emittance lies at 555 micrometers. Wait, no, wait, the question says '555mμ' which is 555 micrometers. Wait, that can't be right because 555 micrometers is 0.555 mm, which is in the microwave region, not where the human eye is sensitive. The human eye is most sensitive at about 555 nm, which is 0.555 micrometers. So perhaps the question has a typo, and it's 555 nm, which is 0.555 micrometers. Alternatively, perhaps it's correct as written, but that would be a very long wavelength, so high wavelength implies low temperature.

Wait, the question says, part c) asks at what temperature the maximum is at 555 mμ. So 555 mμ is 555 *1e-6 meters, which is 5.55e-4 meters. Using Wien's Law, T = b / lambda_max. So b is 2.89777e-3 m·K.

So T = (2.89777e-3 m·K) / (555e-6 m) = (2.89777e-3) / (555e-6) K. Let me compute that.

2.89777e-3 is 0.00289777. Divided by 555e-6 (which is 0.000555) equals approximately 5.22 K. That's way too cold. But that's not making sense because 555 micrometers is a very long wavelength, so the temperature would be extremely low. But if the question intended 555 nm (0.555 micrometers), then T would be 2898 / 0.555 ≈ 5220 K. That's a temperature around 5000 K, which is similar to the sun's surface temperature.

So perhaps part c) is 5220 K. Let me check the options. Looking at the options:

Option I: c) 5220 °K.

Option C: c)5000 °K.

Option G: c)5800 °K.

So if part c) is 5220 K, then option I is a candidate for part c). So if I can find an option where part c) is 5220 K, that would make sense.

But wait, the question as written says 555 mμ, which is 555,000 nm, which is way longer than visible light, so the temperature would be extremely low, which doesn't correspond to any of the options. So perhaps the question has a typo, and it should be 555 nm (0.555 micrometers), which is in the visible range.

Assuming that part c) is 0.555 micrometers, then let's compute T.

T = 2898 / 0.555 = approximately 5220 K. So option I's part c) is 5220 °K. So that's a possibility.

Now, looking for an option where part c) is 5220 K. Only option I has that.

So if option I has c) 5220 K, then maybe other parts fit with it.

Looking at option I: a) 5794 mμ, b) 579.4 mμ. So for a) T=500 K, lambda_max=2898/500=5.796 mμ. Option I's a) is 5794 mμ, which is about 1000 times larger. So that's not matching. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about another approach. Let me compute the correct answers and then match them to the options.

Correct answers:

a) T =500 K: lambda_max = 2898/500 =5.796 mμ → approximately 5.8 mμ.

b) T=5000 K: lambda_max =2898/5000 =0.5796 mμ → about 0.58 mμ, which is 580 nm.

c) lambda_max=555 mμ? No, that can't be right. So T=2898 /555 mμ → wait, 555 mμ is 555e-6 m.

Wait, T= (2.89777e-3 m·K) / (555e-6 m) = (2.89777e-3) / 555e-6 = (2.89777 / 0.555) ≈ 5.22 K. But that's way too cold. So that's not an option, but perhaps the question meant 555 nm, which is 0.555 mμ. So T=2898/0.555 ≈5220 K.

So correct answers:

a) ~5.8 mμ

b) ~0.58 mμ (580 nm)

c) 5220 K.

Now, looking at the options to see if any match these.

Looking through the options, option I is:

a)5794 mμ,

b)579.4 mμ,

c)5220 K.

Hmm, a)5794 is way larger than 5.8. So that can't be right.

Another option: option C:

a)579 mμ,

b)5794 mμ,

c)5000 K.

So a)579 is larger than our calculated 5.8, but maybe if we made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different constant, like 3000 instead of 2898. Let me check: 2898 is the correct value.

Wait, another thought. Perhaps the question uses the formula lambda_max (in nm) = (3 ×10^8 m/s * wavelength in meters )? No, that's Planck's equation, which is more complicated. Wien's Law is lambda_max * T = constant.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. Let's see which option has c) as 5220, which we think is correct.

Only option I has c)5220. So perhaps part a) and b) in that option are incorrect. But let's check:

Option I:

a)5794 mμ. So 5794 mμ is 5.794 mm. That's way too big for 500 K. Because 500 K gives us 5.8 mμ, not 5794.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate part a). T=500 K.

lambda_max = 2898 / 500 = 5.796 micrometers. So correct is about 5.8 mμ.

Looking at the options, perhaps the closest is option C: a)579 mμ, which is 579,000 mμ. No, that's way off. Option I: a)5794 mμ → 5.794 mm, which is way larger than 5.8 mμ.

Wait, perhaps the question is in nanometers? Let me see. 5.8 micrometers is 5800 nanometers. So if the options were in nanometers, perhaps. Let's check option I: a)5794 mμ is 5,794,000 nm, which is 5.794 micrometers. Wait, no, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I've been looking at the wrong options. Let me re-examine all options.

Option E: a)555 mμ, b)5550 mμ, c)5555 °K. So part a) is 555 mμ, which is 0.555 mm. That's way bigger than 5.8 mμ.

Option G: a)1000 mμ, which is 1 mm. No, too big.

Option D: a)600 mμ, which is 0.6 mm. Also too big.

Option B: a)800 mμ, 0.8 mm.

Hmm, none of these match the 5.8 mμ we calculated for part a). So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is lambda_max = (hc)/(5k_B T) * (1/(n)), but that's more complex. No, Wien's Law is lambda_max * T = b.

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Let me double-check. Wien's displacement law: lambda_max (in meters) = (2.8977719e-3 m·K) / T (in Kelvin).

Yes, that's correct.

So for T=500K: 2.89777e-3 /500 = 5.7954e-6 meters =5.7954 micrometers.

So the correct answer for a) is approximately 5.8 micrometers.

Looking again at the options, I don't see any option where a) is around 5.8 mμ. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps the options are written differently. Looking at option I: a)5794 mμ, which is 5.794 mm. So that's 5794 micrometers. Wait, 5794 is 2897*2, so perhaps a miscalculation with the constant.

Wait, perhaps the value of the Wien constant used here is 2897 micrometer·K instead of 2898, but that's a minor difference.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is using the wavelength in nanometers, but that doesn't make sense because the options are in mμ.

Wait, perhaps the question uses the reciprocal formula, like T= b /lambda_max, but with lambda in meters and T in Kelvin. No, that's correct.

Wait, I'm stuck on part a), so perhaps I should check part b) and see if any options make sense.

Part b) T=500
