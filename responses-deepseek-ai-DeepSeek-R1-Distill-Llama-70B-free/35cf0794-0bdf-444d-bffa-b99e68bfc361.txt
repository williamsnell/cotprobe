Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about lenses and image formation. Hmm, I remember from my optics classes that this involves the lensmaker's equation and maybe some magnification formulas. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that a lens is needed to form a virtual image with a magnification of 5. The image distance is 25 cm from the lens. Also, the lens is made of glass with a refractive index of 1.60, and one surface is plane, so the other must be curved. I need to find the radius of curvature of that curved surface.

Wait, virtual image. Right, in optics, a virtual image is formed when the image is on the same side as the object. For a converging lens (which I think this is, because it's forming a virtual image with positive magnification?), wait no, wait. Wait, no, wait: Actually, for a convex lens, a virtual image can be formed when the object is within the focal length. But wait, the magnification here is 5, which is greater than 1. So I think that would require the image to be larger than the object. But wait, if it's a virtual image, is it upright or inverted? Hmm, but maybe I should focus on the formulas first.

The lensmaker's equation is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), but wait, isn't it 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 + 1/R2) when the lens is in air? Or wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, the formula is 1/f = (n-1)[(1/R1) - (1/R2)], but wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Wait, I should double-check. Oh wait, the correct formula is 1/f = (n-1)[1/R1 - 1/R2]. But wait, I'm getting mixed up because different conventions might apply. Oh wait, no, I think the correct formula is 1/f = (n-1) [ (1/R1) + (1/R2) ) ] if both surfaces are curved. Wait, no, perhaps I should clarify.

Wait, the lensmaker's equation is (1/f) = (n-1) [ (1/R1) - (1/R2) ] when the lens is in a medium with refractive index 1 (like air), and R is positive if the surface is convex towards the incoming light. So for a double convex lens, both R1 and R2 would be positive, but wait, depends on which side is which.

But in this problem, one surface is plane. So one of the radii is infinite. Let me think: If one surface is plane, then its radius of curvature is infinite, so 1/R becomes zero. Let's say R2 is infinite (so 1/R2 is zero) because one surface is plane. So the equation simplifies to 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1). Because the other term drops out.

Wait, but wait, I should make sure which surface is which. If the lens is being used to form an image, the object is on one side, and the image on the other, but since it's a virtual image, the image is on the same side as the object. Hmm, maybe I should use the magnification formula.

The magnification m is given by m = - (image distance)/(object distance). Wait, but wait, the formula is m = - (v/u), where v is image distance and u is object distance. But here, the image is virtual, so the image distance is negative. Let me think. Wait, the problem states that the image is at 25 cm from the lens. But wait, in optics, the sign conventions can be tricky. Let me recall: Usually, the object distance is positive if it's on the same side as the incoming light (so, for a real object, it's positive). The image distance is positive if the image is on the opposite side of the lens (real image) and negative if on the same side (virtual image).

Wait, but the problem says the image is virtual, so v is negative. Wait, or does the sign depend on the convention? Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the formula correctly.

So, m = -v/u.

But wait, the problem gives the magnification as 5. So m = 5.

Wait, but the image is virtual, which would mean that the image is on the same side as the object, so perhaps the image distance is negative. But wait, the problem states the distance is 25 cm. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me clarify.

Wait, the image is virtual, so v is negative. The formula for magnification is m = - v/u. So, given m = 5, and v is negative, let's plug in:

5 = - (v)/u → v = -5u.

But wait, the problem says that the image is at 25 cm from the lens. So does that mean |v| =25 cm? Or is v=-25 cm because it's virtual?

I think here, in the problem, the image distance is given as 25 cm, but because it's virtual, v is negative. So v = -25 cm.

Hmm, let's proceed with that.

Then, the magnification formula: m = -v/u → 5 = - ( (-25 cm) ) / u → 5 = 25 cm / u → u = 25 cm /5 =5 cm.

So the object is at 5 cm from the lens.

Wait, wait, that's an important step. So the object distance is 5 cm. Now, what else do I know?

The lens is being used to form a virtual image, which suggests it's a diverging lens, because converging lenses can form virtual images only when the object is inside the focal length, but for a diverging lens, the image is always virtual and on the same side as the object.

Wait, but the glass selected has a refractive index higher than 1, so it's a converging lens. Wait, because n=1.60 is greater than 1, so it's a converging (convex) lens. But wait, a converging lens can form a virtual image if the object is placed within the focal length. So in that case, the image is virtual, upright, and larger, which matches the magnification of 5.

Wait, but for a converging lens, the focal length is positive. So in that case, the image distance v would be negative because it's virtual. So in the thin lens equation, 1/f = 1/u + 1/v.

We have u =5 cm, v = -25 cm.

So 1/f = (1/5) + (1/(-25)) → 1/5 - 1/25 = (5 -1)/25 = 4/25 → f=25/4 =6.25 cm.

So the focal length is 6.25 cm.

Wait, that's positive, which makes sense for a converging lens.

Now, with the focal length known, we can use the lensmaker's equation to find the radius R. Since one surface is plane, let's assume it's the second surface. So R2 = infinity, so 1/R2=0.

So the equation becomes 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1). So 1/R1 = (1/f) / (n-1).

Wait, n is 1.60, so n-1=0.60.

So 1/R1 = (1/6.25) / 0.60 → Let's compute that.

1/6.25 is 0.16. So 0.16 divided by 0.6 is approximately 0.2667.

So 1/R1 = 0.2667 → R1 = 1 / 0.2667 ≈ 3.75 cm.

Wait, but wait, the sign of R1. Hmm, the lensmaker's equation depends on the curvature. So if the lens is converging and one surface is plane, what's the shape?

Wait, for a converging lens, both surfaces are usually convex, but in this case, one is plane. So if the lens is plano-convex, then the curved surface must be convex towards the incoming light. So the radius R1 would be positive.

So R1 is positive, so the radius is 3.75 cm.

Looking at the options, option D is 3.75 cm. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

So, the steps are:

1. Use magnification m =5 = -v/u → v= -25 cm, so u=5 cm.

2. Apply the thin lens equation: 1/f = 1/u +1/v → 1/5 + 1/(-25) = (5-1)/25 =4/25 → f=25/4=6.25 cm.

3. Use lensmaker's equation with one surface plane (R2=inf, so 1/R2=0), so 1/f=(n-1)(1/R1) → R1 = (n-1) * f → 0.6 *6.25 =3.75 cm.

Yes, that seems correct.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given parameters:

1. **Magnification and Image Distance**: The magnification is given as \( m = 5 \), and the image distance is \( v = -25 \, \text{cm} \) (negative because the image is virtual). Using the magnification formula:

\[
m = -\frac{v}{u} \implies 5 = -\frac{-25}{u} \implies u = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \, \text{cm}.
\]

Thus, the object distance is \( u = 5 \, \text{cm} \).

2. **Thin Lens Equation**: Using the thin lens equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} \implies \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{-25} = \frac{5 - 1}{25} = \frac{4}{25}.
\]

From this, the focal length is:

\[
f = \frac{25}{4} = 6.25 \, \text{cm}.
\]

3. **Lensmaker's Equation**: The lensmaker's equation is:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right),
\]

where \( n = 1.60 \) is the refractive index of the glass, and one surface is plane (\( R_2 = \infty \), so \( \frac{1}{R_2} = 0 \)). The equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \frac{1}{R_1}.
\]

Substituting \( f = 6.25 \, \text{cm} \) and \( n - 1 = 0.60 \):

\[
\frac{1}{R_1} = \frac{1}{f} \cdot \frac{1}{n - 1} = \frac{1}{6.25} \cdot \frac{1}{0.60} = \frac{1}{3.75}.
\]

Thus, the radius of curvature of the curved surface is:

\[
R_1 = 3.75 \, \text{cm}.
\]

4. **Final Answer**: Comparing this result with the options, the correct choice is:

**D: 3.75 cm**
