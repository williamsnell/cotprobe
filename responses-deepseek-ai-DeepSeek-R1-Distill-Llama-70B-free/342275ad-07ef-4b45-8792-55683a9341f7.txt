Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the number of days needed to earn a certain amount of interest. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

Alright, the problem is: I have $1,640, and I want to earn $6.56 in interest at a 4% rate. I need to find out how many days it'll take. The options are from A to J, with various day numbers.

Hmm, I remember that interest can be calculated in different ways, like simple interest or compound interest. Oh right, but the question doesn't specify which one, so I think I should go with simple interest since it's more straightforward unless stated otherwise.

Simple interest formula is I = P * R * T. Where I is the interest, P is principal, R is rate, and T is time. But wait, I think time here is in years, right? Because usually, R is an annual rate. So I'll need to convert days into years eventually.

Wait, let me make sure I have the variables right. The principal P is $1,640. The interest I is $6.56. The rate R is 4%, which I should convert to decimal. So 4% is 0.04.

Putting these into the formula: 6.56 = 1640 * 0.04 * T. Let's compute 1640 times 0.04 first. 1640 times 0.04 is 65.6. Oh, wait, because 100 * 0.04 is 4, so 1600 * 0.04 is 64, and 40 * 0.04 is 1.6, so 64 + 1.6 is 65.6. So the equation is 6.56 = 65.6 * T.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 65.6 times T equals 6.56. So T would be 6.56 / 65.6. Let me compute that. 6.56 divided by 65.6. Hmm, let's see. 65.6 times 0.1 is 6.56. Oh wait, 65.6 * 0.1 is 6.56? Let me check: 65.6 * 0.1 is 6.56, yes! So T is 0.1 years.

But wait, the question asks for days, not years. So I need to convert 0.1 years into days. A year is 365 days, so 0.1 * 365 is 36.5 days. Oh, so approximately 36.5 days. Looking at the options, option B is 36 days, and option E is 32, F is 28, H is 30. So the closest is 36 days, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Did I do everything correctly?

Starting over: I = P*R*T. I is 6.56, P=1640, R=0.04. So T = I/(P*R) = 6.56/(1640*0.04).

Compute denominator: 1640 * 0.04 = 65.6. So T = 6.56 / 65.6 = 0.1 years. 0.1 * 365 is 36.5 days. So 36.5 is not exactly an option. The options are 36 (B) or maybe 37 isn't there. So perhaps they rounded down to 36 days, which would be option B.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects the exact days without rounding. But 0.1 years is exactly 36.5 days. So some might consider 36 or 37, but the options have 36 as B and 32 as E, etc. So the correct answer should be option B: 36 days.

I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculation. Wait, did I handle the units correctly? Yes, because I converted the rate into decimal, and the time was calculated in years, then converted to days. Everything seems correct.

To determine the number of days required for $1,640 to produce $6.56 in interest at a 4% annual interest rate, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot R \cdot T
\]

Where:
- \( I = 6.56 \) (interest),
- \( P = 1640 \) (principal),
- \( R = 0.04 \) (annual interest rate in decimal),
- \( T \) is the time in years.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{I}{P \cdot R}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
T = \frac{6.56}{1640 \cdot 0.04}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
1640 \cdot 0.04 = 65.6
\]

Now, divide:

\[
T = \frac{6.56}{65.6} = 0.1 \, \text{years}
\]

Convert \( T \) from years to days (assuming a non-leap year with 365 days):

\[
T = 0.1 \cdot 365 = 36.5 \, \text{days}
\]

The closest option to 36.5 days is **36 days**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: 36 days**
