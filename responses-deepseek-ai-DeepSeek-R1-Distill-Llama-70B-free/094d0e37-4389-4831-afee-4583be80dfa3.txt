Okay, so I've got this problem about heat dissipation and fins on a wall. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on heat transfer, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the setup: there's an aluminum wall at a steady temperature of 650°F. They're attaching these pin-shaped fins to increase the heat dissipation rate. The surrounding air is at 75°F, and the heat transfer coefficient is 28 Btu/hr-ft²-°F. Each fin is 1/8 inch in diameter and 1 inch long. There are three fins per square inch.

Wait, so the question is about finding the percentage increase in the heat dissipation rate when adding these fins. Right, so I think I need to compare the heat dissipated without the fins to the heat dissipated with the fins.

Without the fins, the heat transfer is just natural convection from the wall. The formula for heat transfer is Q = h * A * ΔT, where h is the heat transfer coefficient, A is the area, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

But with the fins, the total heat transfer would be the sum of the heat from the wall without the fin areas plus the heat each fin contributes. Or wait, maybe I should consider the effective area with the fins. Or perhaps the fins increase the surface area available for convection, thus increasing Q.

Wait, another approach: The heat dissipation without fins is based on the wall area. But when adding fins, each fin adds to the surface area, so the total heat is the original wall area times h times ΔT plus the sum of all the fins' heat loss.

Or perhaps a better way is to think about the overall heat transfer. Without fins, the heat transfer is Q0 = h * A_wall * (T_wall - T_air). With the fins, the total heat Q would be Q0 plus the heat from each fin.

Wait, but each fin is attached to the wall, so the base of the fin is at 650°F, same as the wall. The fins are made of aluminum, so their thermal conductivity is high, which means they can conduct heat away efficiently.

So each pin fin's heat dissipation can be calculated using the formula for a fin under the assumption that the heat transfer coefficient is uniform. The formula for a fin is Q_fin = (k * A_c * h * L * (T_base - T_air)) / ( (h * (4 * L) / (π * d)) )^(1/2) )? Wait no, I think I'm mixing up some terms.

Wait, the formula for the heat dissipated by a cylindrical (pin) fin is Q = (k * h * D * L * (T_base - T_air)) / ( (h * (4 L) ) / (π D) )) )^(1/2) ? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Oh right, the heat dissipated by a fin can be calculated using Q = sqrt( (k * h * A_s) * (perimeter * L) )) * (T_base - T_ambient). Or wait, perhaps the correct formula is Q = (h * A_total) * (T_base - T_amb) * η_f, where η_f is the fin efficiency.

Wait, I think the proper formula is Q = (k * A_c * m * tanh(m*L)) * (T_base - T_amb), where m is the fin parameter sqrt( (h * P) / (k * A_c) ) ). For a cylindrical fin, P is the perimeter, so P = π D. The cross-sectional area A_c is (π D²)/4.

So m = sqrt( (h * π D) / (k * (π D²/4)) )) ) = sqrt( (4 h) / (k D) )

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

m = sqrt( (h * perimeter) / (k * A_c) )

Perimeter P = π D for a cylinder.

A_c is the cross-sectional area: π D² /4.

So m = sqrt( (h * π D) / (k * (π D²/4)) )) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

h * π D in numerator.

Denominator: k * π D² / 4.

So m = sqrt( (h * π D) * 4 ) / (k * π D²) )

Wait, wait, let me compute that correctly.

The denominator is k * (π D²/4), so when you take the reciprocal, it's 4/(k π D²).

So inside the sqrt, it becomes (h π D) * (4) / (k π D²)).

The π cancels, D in numerator and D squared in denominator becomes 1/D.

So, (4 h) / (k D) )

Thus, m = sqrt(4 h/(k D)).

Wait, m = sqrt( (4 h) / (k D) ) = 2 * sqrt( h/(k D) )

Once we have m, we can compute the heat dissipated by the fin.

So Q_fin = k * A_c * m * (T_base - T_amb) * tanh(m L)

Alternatively, sometimes I've seen it written as Q = (h * A_total) * (T_base - T_amb) * η, where η is the efficiency of the fin.

Hmm, maybe using the fin efficiency approach would be easier.

The fin efficiency η is given by η = (Q_fin)/(h A_total (T_base - T_amb)).

For a cylindrical fin, the efficiency can be found as:

η = (2 / (m D)) * (tanh(m L)) / (m L)

Wait, let me double-check. Or maybe another formula.

Wait, another approach: The formula for efficiency of a cylindrical fin is:

η = ( (2 * tanh(m L)) ) / (m L )

Wait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think. The efficiency for a long, cylindrical fin is:

η = ( (2 * (tanh(m L)) ) ) / (m L )

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the exact formula, but since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed with the formula I think is correct.

So for each fin, the heat dissipated is Q = η * h * A_total (T_base - T_amb)

But wait, A_total for a cylindrical fin is the surface area, which is π D L.

So for each fin, the heat is Q = η * h * (π D L) * (T_base - T_amb)

So, first, I need to compute m.

Given:

h = 28 Btu/hr-ft²-°F (but need to convert units for consistency, because D is in inches).

Wait, the diameter D is 1/8 inch, which is 1/8 /12 ft = 1/(96) ft.

Similarly, L is 1 inch, which is 1/12 ft.

k for aluminum is 120 Btu/hr-ft-°F.

So, compute m:

m = sqrt( (4 h) / (k D) )

h is 28, k is 120, D is 1/96 ft.

So 4 h = 4 * 28 = 112.

k D = 120 * (1/96) = 120/96 = 5/4 (since 96 is 24*4, 120 is 30*4, 30/24=5/4? Wait, 120/96 = 1.25, which is 5/4.

So 4h/(k D) = 112 / (5/4) ) = 112 * (4/5) = (112 *4)/5 = 448/5 = 89.6.

So m = sqrt(89.6) ≈ 9.47 ft^-1.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check:

h = 28, D = 1/8 inch = 0.008333 ft.

So 4h = 112.

k D = 120 * 0.008333 = approximately 1.0.

Wait 120 * (1/96) is 120/96 = 1.25, as before.

Ah, wait, 4h/(k D) = 112 / 1.25 = 89.6. So sqrt(89.6) is about 9.47.

Hmm.

Now, m L is m times L. L is 1 inch = 1/12 ft ≈ 0.08333 ft.

So m L = 9.47 * 0.08333 ≈ 0.789.

Wait, so m L is about 0.789.

Now, tanh(m L) is tanh(0.789). Hmm, tanh(0.7) is about 0.61, tanh(0.8) is about 0.66, so 0.789 is around 0.66 or so. Let me calculate: 

tanh(x) can be approximated as x - x^3/3 + 2x^5/15 ... but perhaps it's easier to just remember that for x < 1, tanh(x) is approximately 0.76 * x for x up to 1, but maybe I should just use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator-like approach. Let me think: 

At x=0.789, tanh(x) is about (e^x - e^(-x))/(e^x + e^(-x)).

But without exact calculations, perhaps it's around 0.66. Let me proceed with that.

So, tanh(m L) ≈ 0.66.

Now, the fin efficiency η is (2 * tanh(m L)) / (m L * D) ? Wait, no, wait. The formula for the efficiency of a cylindrical fin is:

η = (2 * tanh(m L)) / (m L)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because for a cylindrical fin, the efficiency is:

η = (2 * (tanh(m L)) ) / (m L)

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again: 

The formula for the efficiency of a cylindrical pin fin is:

η = ( (2 * (tanh(m L)) ) ) / (m L )

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, another source says that for a cylindrical fin, the efficiency is:

η = [ (2 / (m L)) * tanh(m L) ]

Hmm, that makes more sense. So η = (2 * tanh(m L)) / (m L )

So, with m L = 0.789 and tanh(m L)=0.66.

So η = (2 * 0.66) / 0.789 ≈ (1.32) / 0.789 ≈ 1.67.

Wait, that can't be right because efficiency can't be more than 1.

Oh wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Because the efficiency η for a cylindrical fin is actually given by:

η = ( (2 * ( sinh(m L) ) ) / ( m L * sqrt( (h P)/(k A) ) ) ) )

Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe I should refer back to the standard formula.

Wait, I think I remember that for a cylindrical fin, the efficiency is:

η = [ (2 * (tanh(m L)) ) ] / (m L )

But that would mean if m L is small, tanh(m L) ≈ m L, so η ≈ 2 m L / (m L ) = 2, which can't be right because efficiency can't exceed 1. So I must have the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the efficiency of a cylindrical fin is:

η = [ (tanh(m L)) ] / (m L )

But then for m L approaching zero, tanh(m L) approaches m L, so η approaches 1, which makes sense. So maybe that's the correct formula.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for the heat dissipated by the fin.

Q_fin = (k * A_c * m * (T_base - T_amb)) * tanh(m L)

Where A_c is the cross-sectional area, which for a cylinder is π D² /4.

So let's compute that.

Given:

k = 120 Btu/hr-ft-°F

A_c = π (D/2)^2 = π ( (1/8 inch)/2 )². Wait, but we need to convert D into feet.

Wait, D is 1/8 inch. 1 inch is 1/12 ft, so 1/8 inch is (1/8)*(1/12) ft = 1/(96) ft.

So D = 1/96 ft. So D/2 = 1/(192) ft.

A_c = π * (1/(192))² ft².

Hmm, that's a very small area. Let me compute A_c:

= π * (1)^2 / (192)^2 = π / (36864) ≈ 3.1416 / 36864 ≈ 8.52e-5 ft².

m is about 9.47 ft^-1.

m L = 9.47 * (1/12) ft = 0.789.

tanh(m L) = tanh(0.789) ≈ 0.66.

So Q_fin = 120 * (8.52e-5) * 9.47 * (650 -75 ) * 0.66.

Wait, wait, let me write all the terms:

Q_fin = k * A_c * m * (T_base - T_amb) * tanh(m L)

So substituting:

k = 120

A_c = π*(1/96/2)^2 = π*(1/(192))^2 ≈ 8.52e-5 ft².

m = 9.47 ft^-1

ΔT = 650 -75 = 575 °F

tanh(m L) ≈ 0.66

So:

120 * 8.52e-5 * 9.47 * 575 * 0.66

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute 120 * 8.52e-5 = 120 * 0.0000852 ≈ 0.01024.

Then multiply by 9.47: 0.01024 * 9.47 ≈ 0.0969.

Multiply by 575: 0.0969 * 575 ≈ 55.7075.

Multiply by 0.66: 55.7075 * 0.66 ≈ 36.766.

So each fin dissipates about 36.77 Btu/hr.

Wait, that seems high, but let's proceed.

Now, each square inch has 3 fins. So per square inch, the heat from the fins is 3 * 36.77 ≈ 110.3 Btu/hr.

But wait, per square inch of wall area. Because each square inch of wall has 3 fins attached to it.

Wait, but wait, the wall has an area of 1 square inch, but the fins are attached on top of it. So the base area of each fin is π*(D/2)^2. For D=1/8 inch, each fin's base area is π*(1/16 inch)^2. But the wall area per square inch is 1 in², and each fin's base area is tiny, so the total base area covered by the fins is 3 * π*(1/16)^2 in². Wait, but 3*(π*(1/16)^2) is approximately 3*(0.00125) ≈ 0.0037 in², which is much less than 1 in². So the wall area is still 1 in², but the fins add their surface area.

So, the original heat without fins is Q0 = h * A * ΔT.

But A is 1 square foot? Wait, no, the area is per square inch, but the units here are in ft. Wait, no, the question is about per square inch of wall, perhaps? Or maybe it's considering the area as 1 ft², but with 3 fins per square inch, so 3 * 144 fins per square foot.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says three fins per square inch are attached. So each square inch of wall area has 3 fins. So for 1 square foot (144 in²), there are 3 * 144 = 432 fins.

But maybe it's easier to compute per square inch.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the heat per square inch with and without fins, then find the percentage increase.

Without fins: the heat is Q0 = h * A * ΔT.

h is 28 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

A is 1 square foot, but wait, the question is about per square inch. Wait, no, the question is about the entire wall, but the fins are per square inch. Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute per square inch of wall area.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of per square inch.

So, for 1 square inch of wall area without fins:

A = 1 in² = 1/144 ft².

Q0 = h * A * ΔT = 28 * (1/144) * (650 -75) = 28 * (1/144) * 575.

Compute that:

575 * 28 = 16,100.

16,100 / 144 ≈ 111.81 Btu/hr per square inch.

Wait, that seems high, but maybe because the temperature difference is large.

But wait, that can't be right because 28 Btu/(hr-ft²-°F) is a typical h value for natural convection. But let's proceed.

Now, with the fins, each square inch has 3 fins. Each fin contributes Q_fin = 36.77 Btu/hr, as calculated earlier.

So 3 fins contribute 3 * 36.77 ≈ 110.3 Btu/hr per square inch.

Wait, but that's only the heat from the fins. What about the heat from the wall area not covered by the base of the fins?

Because the base of each fin covers some area on the wall, which would otherwise contribute to Q0. So the total area of the wall covered by the bases of the fins is 3*(π*(D/2)^2).

Each fin has a base area of π*(D/2)^2. D is 1/8 inch, so D/2 = 1/16 inch. So area per fin base is π*(1/16)^2 square inches.

So 3 fins: 3 * π*(1/16)^2 ≈ 3*(0.00125) ≈ 0.0037 in².

So the wall's effective area is 1 in² minus the base areas of the fins, 1 - 0.0037
