Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully. Hmm. So, the question is about reaction rates. A reacts with B in a one-step reaction to give C. The rate constant is given as 2.0 × 10^-3 M^-1 sec^-1. Then, they've given the moles of A and B in a 0.50-liter box. I need to find the initial rate of the reaction.

Wait, right, the rate law. I remember that for a reaction like A + B → C, the rate law is rate = k[A]^m [B]^n, where m and n are the orders with respect to A and B. But wait, the problem says it's a one-step reaction. Oh, right! In a single-step reaction, the stoichiometry determines the rate law. So if the reaction is a single step, the rate law would be first order in each reactant if the stoichiometry is 1 for each. So assuming the balanced equation is A + B → C, the rate would be k[A][B].

But wait, the problem doesn't give the balanced equation. Oh, the question says A reacts with B to give C, but it doesn't specify the stoichiometric coefficients. Hmm. Maybe it's a 1:1 reaction. Because often when not specified, it's assumed to be first order in each. So I'll proceed with that.

So the rate is k[A][B]. Now, I need to find the concentrations of A and B. The volume is 0.50 liters. So moles divided by volume gives concentration.

Moles of A: 0.50 moles. Volume is 0.50 L, so concentration of A is 0.50 / 0.50 = 1.0 M.

Similarly, moles of B: 0.30 moles. Concentration is 0.30 / 0.50 = 0.6 M.

So now, plug into the rate equation. Rate = k [A][B] = (2.0e-3 M^-1 s^-1) * 1.0 M * 0.6 M.

Let me calculate that. 2.0e-3 multiplied by 1 is 2.0e-3. Then multiplied by 0.6 is 1.2e-3 M/s.

Wait, looking at the options, let me see. Option G is 1.20e-3, which matches this. So the initial rate should be 1.2e-3 M/sec.

But wait, wait a second. What if the reaction is not first order in both? Like, what if it's a different stoichiometry? Oh, but the problem says it's a one-step reaction, so the rate law is based on the coefficients. Since the reaction equation isn't provided, the default assumption is that each reactant's order is 1. So I think the approach is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is G.

To determine the initial rate of the reaction, we start by noting that the reaction is a single-step process where A reacts with B. The rate law for such a reaction is typically given by:

\[
\text{Rate} = k[A][B]
\]

where \(k\) is the rate constant, and \([A]\) and \([B]\) are the concentrations of reactants A and B, respectively. The problem specifies that the rate constant \(k\) is \(2.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}^{-1} \text{sec}^{-1}\). The stoichiometry of the reaction is not explicitly provided, but since it is a one-step reaction, it is assumed to follow the simplest case where the reaction is first order in each reactant.

Next, we calculate the concentrations of A and B. The number of moles of A is \(0.50 \, \text{moles}\), and the number of moles of B is \(0.30 \, \text{moles}\). The volume of the reaction vessel is \(0.50 \, \text{liters}\), so the concentrations are:

\[
[A] = \frac{0.50 \, \text{moles}}{0.50 \, \text{liters}} = 1.0 \, \text{M}
\]
\[
[B] = \frac{0.30 \, \text{moles}}{0.50 \, \text{liters}} = 0.6 \, \text{M}
\]

Substituting these values into the rate law:

\[
\text{Rate} = k[A][B] = (2.0 \times 10^{-3}) (1.0) (0.6) = 1.2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M/sec}
\]

Thus, the initial rate of the reaction is \(1.2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M/sec}\), which corresponds to option **G**.
