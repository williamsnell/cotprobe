Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's take it step by step. The question is about completing a sentence with the correct terms related to influencing someone, probably in a business or political context.

The sentence is: "There are a number of means by which can influence _______. These include _________ to decision maker, varying from very direct modes to indirect modes, _________, being either public or private and ________ of communication."

I think the first blank is about who or what is being influenced. The options include Employees, Consumers, or Government. Since the context is about influencing decision-makers, I'm leaning towards Government because decision-makers in policy or law would be government officials. But wait, it could also be consumers if it's about marketing influencing purchasing decisions. Hmm.

Next, the second blank is about what is being done to the decision maker. The options for this part vary, but looking at the options, I see phrases like "Avenue of approach" and "Breadth of transmission." Wait, "Avenue of approach" makes sense because it's about the way you approach the decision maker—like direct or indirect methods.

So the sentence would read, "These include [avenue of approach] to decision maker, varying from very direct modes to indirect modes." That makes sense. So the second blank is filled with "Avenue of approach."

Now the third blank is about something that can be public or private. Looking at the options, it's either "Breadth of transmission" or "Content." Wait, "Breadth of transmission" might refer to how widely the information is spread, which can be public (like a public announcement) or private (like a confidential memo). So that fits the third blank.

The fourth blank is about communication. The options are "Avenue of approach" again, but wait, that's already used in the second blank. So maybe it's "Content" or "Height of transmission." Wait, "Height of transmission" doesn't sound familiar. Maybe "Content" refers to the actual information being communicated. So the last part would be "content of communication."

Putting it all together: The sentence would be something like: "There are a number of means by which can influence Government. These include Avenue of approach to decision maker, varying from very direct modes to indirect modes, Breadth of transmission, being either public or private and Content of communication."

Looking at the options, let me check each choice. Let's see option H: Government, Avenue of approach, Breadth of transmission, Content. So the blanks would be filled as:

1. Government
2. Avenue of approach
3. Breadth of transmission
4. Content

That fits the structure I thought. So option H seems correct.

Wait, let me double-check. Are there any other options that might fit better? Option I has Government, Content, Breadth, Avenue—so the order is different. The third blank in the sentence is about being public or private, which would be Breadth of transmission as it relates to the scope (public vs private). So option H is correct.

The correct answer is H.

H: Government, Avenue of approach, Breadth of transmission, Content

Answer: H
