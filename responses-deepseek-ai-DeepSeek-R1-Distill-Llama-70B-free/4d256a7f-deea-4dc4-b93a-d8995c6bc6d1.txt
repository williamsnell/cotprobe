Question:

A homeowner gave his friend a mortgage on his property to secure a loan from the friend to the homeowner in the amount of $100,000. The homeowner then gives an investor a mortgage on the property to secure a loan from the investor to the homeowner in the amount of $80,000. The friend then records his mortgage. The homeowner then gives a bank a mortgage on the property to secure a loan from the bank to the homeowner in the amount of $50,000. The investor then records. The bank then records. The homeowner lost his job and was unable to pay the mortgages on the property. In a foreclosure proceeding in which the friend, the investor, and the bank were parties, the property sold for $160,000. The recording statute in this jurisdiction provided "unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice. "What dollar amount, if any, should go to the friend?

Options:

A: $100,000. 00
B: $90,000.00
C: $160,000.00
D: $0. 00

Okay, let me try to work through this problem. It's about mortgages and foreclosure, so I think it involves property law and the recording statutes. Hmm, I remember that recording statutes determine the priority of interests in real property. The key here is understanding who has priority over whom based on when they recorded their mortgages and whether they are subsequent purchasers who paid value without notice.

So the scenario is that a homeowner gives three different mortgages on his property. First, he gives a mortgage to his friend for $100,000. Then, he gives another mortgage to an investor for $80,000. After that, he gives a mortgage to the bank for $50,000.

Now, the recording part is a bit tricky. The friend records his mortgage first. Then the investor records, and then the bank records. Wait, but the order of recording is important because the recording statute here says that "unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice." So this sounds like a notice statute, right? Because it's void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice.

Wait, no, actually, the wording is "void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice." That would make it a notice-race jurisdiction. So the priority is determined by the order of recording, but only for subsequent purchasers who are bona fide (paid value and without notice). So if someone records later, whether they have priority depends on whether they were a subsequent purchaser without notice.

Let me try to outline the timeline:

1. Homeowner gives Friend Mortgage for $100k. Friend doesn't record immediately.
2. Homeowner gives Investor Mortgage for $80k. Investor records later.
3. Homeowner gives Bank Mortgage for $50k. Bank records last.

But the recording order is Friend first, then Investor, then Bank. Wait, no. The order of recording is Friend records first, then Investor records after the Bank is given, but before the Bank records. Wait, let me clarify:

- The events occur in this order:

a) Friend gets mortgage.
b) Investor gets mortgage.
c) Friend records.
d) Bank gets mortgage.
e) Investor records.
f) Bank records.

Wait, no, the problem says:

- The homeowner gives Friend a mortgage (1st).
- Then gives Investor a mortgage (2nd).
- Friend records (so after giving the 1st and 2nd mortgages, Friend records).
- Then, Homeowner gives Bank a mortgage (3rd).
- Then, Investor records.
- Then, Bank records.

So the order of recording is Friend first, then Investor, then Bank. But the order of the mortgages being created is Friend first, then Investor, then Bank.

So in terms of recording, Friend's mortgage is recorded before Investor's, which is recorded before Bank's. But the mortgages were given in the order Friend, Investor, Bank.

But the question is about priority. Let's think about each mortgage and whether they are protected under the recording statute.

The recording statute says that unrecorded instruments are void against subsequent purchasers who pay value and without notice. So each time a mortgage is recorded, subsequent purchasers (for value and without notice) will have priority over earlier unrecorded interests.

Wait, but in this case, each mortgage is given by the same homeowner, so perhaps they are each taking a mortgage from the homeowner, but the issue is among themselves.

Let me consider each party's position.

Friend's mortgage: created first, but recorded after Investor's mortgage was created. Wait, no, Friend's mortgage was given first, then Investor, then Bank.

But Friend recorded before Investor. So when the Investor took their mortgage, was the Friend's mortgage already recorded? No, because Friend recorded after Investor's mortgage was taken but before the Bank's.

Wait, the timeline is:

1. Homeowner gives Friend a mortgage (Mortgage 1) on day 1.
2. Homeowner gives Investor a mortgage (Mortgage 2) on day 2.
3. Friend records Mortgage 1 on day 3.
4. Homeowner gives Bank a mortgage (Mortgage 3) on day 4.
5. Investor records Mortgage 2 on day 5.
6. Bank records Mortgage 3 on day 6.

So, when Mortgage 2 (Investor) was given on day 2, was Mortgage 1 (Friend) recorded? No, because Friend recorded on day 3, which is after Mortgage 2 was given. So when the Investor took the mortgage, the Friend's mortgage was unrecorded. So, under the recording statute, if the Investor is a subsequent purchaser who paid value and without notice, then the Friend's mortgage would be void against the Investor.

Wait, but the Investor is not a purchaser; the Investor is a mortgagee. Wait, the recording statute typically applies to purchasers, but in the context of mortgages, each mortgage is an encumbrance. So when a subsequent mortgagee records, they can take priority over earlier unrecorded mortgages if they are a bona fide purchaser (BFP) for value without notice.

So each time a mortgage is given, the new mortgagee's priority depends on whether, at the time they took their mortgage, the prior mortgage was recorded. If prior was unrecorded, and the new mortgagee had no notice, then the new mortgagee's interest can take priority.

Wait, but in this case, the Friend, Investor, and Bank are all mortgagees, not purchasers. So perhaps the order of recording determines their priority.

Wait, but the general rule is first in time, first in right, but subject to recording. So under a notice statute, a subsequent mortgagee who records first and is a BFP without notice of the prior unrecorded mortgage can have priority.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each mortgage's status when it was recorded.

When Friend recorded on day 3, Mortgage 1 was recorded. At that point, any subsequent mortgagees (Investor and Bank) would have constructive notice of Mortgage 1.

Wait, but the Investor took Mortgage 2 on day 2, before Friend recorded on day 3. So when the Investor took Mortgage 2, Mortgage 1 was unrecorded. So the Investor, when taking Mortgage 2, would have had no notice of Mortgage 1 if they didn't check the records (since it wasn't recorded yet). So under a notice statute, the Investor's Mortgage 2 would take priority over Friend's Mortgage 1 if the Investor is a BFP without notice.

But wait, the Investor took Mortgage 2 before Friend recorded. So the Investor is a subsequent encumbrancer (after Friend's Mortgage 1) but without notice of Mortgage 1 because it was unrecorded. So in a notice jurisdiction, the Investor's Mortgage 2 would have priority over Friend's Mortgage 1 because when the Investor took the mortgage, Friend's was unrecorded, so Investor had no notice.

But wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try a different approach.

In a notice jurisdiction, the priority is determined by the order of recording, but only if the subsequent party (the one who records later) was a BFP without notice of the prior unrecorded interest.

So when the Friend recorded, the Investor had already taken their mortgage. When the Investor took their mortgage, Friend's was unrecorded. So the Investor, being a subsequent encumbrancer, without notice of Friend's mortgage, would have priority over Friend's mortgage.

Wait, but the Friend recorded before the Investor recorded. Because Friend recorded on day 3, and Investor recorded on day 5. So the Friend's mortgage was recorded before the Investor's. So when the Investor records, their mortgage would be junior to Friend's because Friend's was recorded first. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the Investor took their mortgage before Friend recorded. So when the Investor took their mortgage, Friend's was not recorded, so Investor had no notice, making their mortgage senior.

Wait, no, perhaps the priority is determined by the first to record among the two, but if the subsequent party (Investor) was without notice when they took their mortgage, their mortgage would have priority.

I think the key is that in a notice jurisdiction, if you are a subsequent encumbrancer (like the Investor) and you take your mortgage without notice of the prior unrecorded mortgage, your mortgage will have priority even if the prior one is recorded later.

Wait, but in this case, when the Investor took their mortgage on day 2, Friend's mortgage was unrecorded. So the Investor had no notice, so their mortgage (Mortgage 2) would take priority over Friend's Mortgage 1, even though Friend recorded first.

Wait, that can't be right because Friend recorded on day 3, which is before the Investor records on day 5. So when the Investor records, their mortgage would be after Friend's recorded mortgage. But the Investor's mortgage was taken before Friend recorded, so perhaps they have priority.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about it step by step.

In a notice jurisdiction:

- A subsequent purchaser (or mortgagee) who takes without notice of a prior unrecorded interest will have priority over that prior interest, even if the prior interest is later recorded.

So the order of events:

1. Friend gets Mortgage 1 on day 1. Not recorded yet.
2. Investor gets Mortgage 2 on day 2. At this point, Friend's Mortgage 1 is unrecorded, so Investor has no notice and thus Mortgage 2 would have priority over Mortgage 1 if recorded later.
3. Friend records Mortgage 1 on day 3. Now, anyone after day 3 who takes a mortgage would have constructive notice of Mortgage 1.
4. Bank gets Mortgage 3 on day 4. At this point, Friend's Mortgage 1 is already recorded, so the Bank would have notice. Also, the Investor's Mortgage 2 is unrecorded at this point because Investor records on day 5.
5. Investor records Mortgage 2 on day 5. Now, even though Mortgage 2 was given on day 2, it's recorded on day 5, after Friend's Mortgage 1 was recorded on day 3. But because when Investor took Mortgage 2 on day 2, Friend's Mortgage 1 was unrecorded, the Investor's Mortgage 2 would have priority over Friend's Mortgage 1.
6. Bank records Mortgage 3 on day 6. At the time the Bank took the mortgage on day 4, Friend's Mortgage 1 was already recorded, so the Bank would have notice of it. The Investor's Mortgage 2 was unrecorded at the time the Bank took Mortgage 3, but the Bank would have had no notice of it because it wasn't recorded until day 5, after the Bank's mortgage was taken on day 4. So when the Bank records on day 6, their Mortgage 3 would be junior to both Friend's and Investor's because both were already recorded before the Bank's recording. Wait, no, because Friend's was recorded on day 3, Investor's on day 5, and Bank's on day 6. So the order of recording is Friend (day3), Investor (day5), Bank (day6). So the Bank's mortgage would be last in priority because it was recorded last. But wait, does the Bank have priority over the Investor?

Wait, no, because the Investor's mortgage was recorded before the Bank's. So the order of priority would be:

1. Friend's Mortgage 1, recorded day3.

But wait, the Investor's Mortgage 2 was taken before Friend's was recorded, so under notice statute, the Investor's Mortgage 2 would have priority over Friend's Mortgage 1.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let's try a different approach.

In a notice jurisdiction, the rule is that an earlier mortgagee is protected against a subsequent mortgagee only if the subsequent mortgagee had notice of the earlier mortgage. If the subsequent mortgagee had no notice (because the earlier wasn't recorded), then the subsequent's mortgage will have priority.

So in this case:

- Friend's Mortgage 1 is given first but recorded after Investor's Mortgage 2 is given.

So when Investor took Mortgage 2, Friend's Mortgage 1 was unrecorded, so Investor had no notice. Therefore, under a notice statute, Investor's Mortgage 2 would have priority over Friend's Mortgage 1, even though Friend's Mortgage 1 was recorded later.

So when Friend records on day3, but Investor's Mortgage 2 was taken on day2 without notice, the Investor's Mortgage 2 would still have priority over Friend's Mortgage 1.

Then, the Bank takes Mortgage 3 on day4. At that time, Friend's Mortgage 1 has been recorded (day3), so the Bank would have notice of it. So the Bank's Mortgage 3 would be junior to Friend's Mortgage 1, but what about the Investor's Mortgage 2? Because when the Bank took Mortgage 3 on day4, Investor's Mortgage 2 was unrecorded (recorded on day5). So the Bank would have no notice of Investor's Mortgage 2 because it wasn't recorded yet. Therefore, the Bank's Mortgage 3 would have priority over Investor's Mortgage 2, because the Bank had no notice of it when the Mortgage 3 was taken.

Wait, but this seems conflicting. Let me think again:

- Friend's Mortgage 1: recorded day3.

- Investor's Mortgage 2: taken day2, recorded day5.

- Bank's Mortgage 3: taken day4, recorded day6.

When the Bank took Mortgage 3 on day4, the only recorded mortgage was Friend's (day3). The Investor's Mortgage 2 was unrecorded at that time (recorded on day5), so the Bank had no notice of it. Therefore, under a notice statute, the Bank's Mortgage 3 would have priority over the Investor's Mortgage 2, even though Investor's Mortgage 2 was taken earlier.

Wait, but the Investor's Mortgage 2 was taken on day2, before Friend's was recorded. So the Investor's Mortgage 2 has priority over Friend's Mortgage 1 because when Investor took it, Friend's wasn't recorded, so no notice. So the order would be:

1. Investor's Mortgage 2 (taken day2, recorded day5, but has priority over Friend's because Friend's was unrecorded when Investor took it).

2. Friend's Mortgage 1 (taken day1, recorded day3, but because Investor took theirs without notice, it's junior to Investor's).

3. Bank's Mortgage 3 (taken day4, recorded day6). At the time the Bank took it, Friend's was recorded, so Bank has notice of Friend's, making it junior to Friend's. But what about Investor's Mortgage 2? When the Bank took theirs on day4, Investor's Mortgage 2 was unrecorded, so the Bank had no notice. Therefore, the Bank's Mortgage 3 would have priority over the Investor's Mortgage 2 because when the Bank took their mortgage, they had no notice of Investor's, which was unrecorded at the time.

Wait, but that can't be right because the Investor's Mortgage 2 was taken before the Bank's Mortgage 3. So if the Bank took their mortgage without notice of the Investor's, then the Bank's would have priority over the Investor's.

So the priority order would be:

1. Friend's Mortgage 1: taken first, but because Investor's was taken without notice, Friend's is junior to Investor's.

Wait, no, that's conflicting. Let me try to outline the priority:

- Mortgage 1 (Friend): taken day1, recorded day3.

- Mortgage 2 (Investor): taken day2, recorded day5.

- Mortgage 3 (Bank): taken day4, recorded day6.

Under notice statute:

- Mortgage 2 (Investor) is taken without notice of Mortgage 1 (Friend) because Friend's wasn't recorded yet. So Mortgage 2 has priority over Mortgage 1.

- Mortgage 3 (Bank) is taken on day4, when Mortgage 1 is recorded, so Bank has notice of Mortgage 1. But Mortgage 2 was unrecorded on day4, so Bank has no notice of Mortgage 2. Therefore, Mortgage 3 has priority over Mortgage 2.

So the priority order would be:

1. Mortgage 2 (Investor) because it's taken without notice of Mortgage 1.

2. Mortgage 3 (Bank) because it's taken without notice of Mortgage 2.

3. Mortgage 1 (Friend) because it's the earliest but was unrecorded when Mortgage 2 was taken.

Wait, but that would mean the priority is Investor first, then Bank, then Friend. But that doesn't seem right because the Friend's mortgage was recorded before the Investor's.

No, wait, the priority isn't based on recording date but on when each mortgage was taken relative to others and notice.

So the order would be:

- Investor's Mortgage 2 has priority over Friend's Mortgage 1 because when Investor took it, Friend's was unrecorded, so no notice.

- Bank's Mortgage 3 has priority over Investor's Mortgage 2 because when Bank took it, Investor's was unrecorded, so no notice.

So the order is:

1. Bank's Mortgage 3.

2. Investor's Mortgage 2.

3. Friend's Mortgage 1.

But that would mean the Bank's mortgage has first priority, followed by Investor, then Friend.

Wait, but the Bank's mortgage was taken after both Friend and Investor. So how can it have first priority?

Alternatively, perhaps the priority is determined by the order of recording, but with exceptions for notice.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each mortgage's status when they were recorded.

When Friend recorded on day3, any subsequent mortgages (Investor and Bank) would have notice of Friend's mortgage. But Investor's mortgage was taken before Friend recorded, so Investor didn't have notice.

Wait, but when Friend records, it's after Investor took their mortgage. So Friend's recording would not affect the Investor's priority, because the Investor took theirs without notice.

So let's think about each mortgage's position:

- Friend's Mortgage 1: recorded on day3. So anyone after day3 would have notice.

- Investor's Mortgage 2: taken on day2 (before Friend recorded) and recorded on day5. Since when taken, Friend's was unrecorded, Investor's Mortgage 2 has priority over Friend's.

- Bank's Mortgage 3: taken on day4 (after Friend recorded on day3) so Bank has notice of Friend's Mortgage 1. But when Bank took their mortgage on day4, Investor's Mortgage 2 was unrecorded (recorded on day5), so Bank has no notice of it, thus Bank's Mortgage 3 would have priority over Investor's.

So the priority order would be:

1. Bank's Mortgage 3: because when taken, only Friend's was recorded. Bank doesn't have notice of Investor's, so Bank's has priority over Investor's.

2. Investor's Mortgage 2: because when taken, Friend's was unrecorded, so Investor's has priority over Friend's.

3. Friend's Mortgage 1: because it was recorded, but when Investor took their mortgage, Friend's was unrecorded, so Friend's is last.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the Bank's mortgage was taken after both
