Okay, so I need to find the prime factorization of 48 and choose the correct option from A to J. Hmm, let's start by recalling what prime factorization is. It's breaking down a number into the product of its prime numbers, right? And primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

So, 48 is the number here. I think I'll start by dividing by the smallest prime, which is 2. Let's see:

48 divided by 2 is 24. Okay, that's one 2.
24 divided by 2 is 12. That's two 2s now.
12 divided by 2 is 6. Three 2s.
6 divided by 2 is 3. Four 2s. 

Now, 3 is a prime number, so I stop here. So the prime factors are 2^4 and 3^1. Wait, because I divided by 2 four times and got 3 once. So putting it together, it's 2^4 multiplied by 3.

Looking at the options, let me check each one:

Option A: 4 • 8. Well, 4 is 2² and 8 is 2³. So that's 2^(2+3) = 2^5. But 2^5 is 32, which is less than 48, so that's not right.

Option B: 2^4 • 3. That's exactly what I got. So this looks correct.

Option C: 6 • 8. 6 is 2*3 and 8 is 2³. So that's 2^4 * 3, same as B. Wait, so both B and C have the same prime factors when broken down? But wait, the question says to use exponents where possible. So in the answer, they should express it using exponents, not as separate factors. So option C is written as 6*8, which isn't using exponents, so it's not the prime factorization with exponents. So B is better because it uses exponents.

Option D: 2³ • 3². Let me calculate that. 2³ is 8, 3² is 9. 8*9 is 72, which is more than 48, so that's not right.

Option E: 2^5 • 3. 2^5 is 32, 32*3 is 96. Not 48.

Option F: 2² •4². Wait, 4 is not a prime. 4 is 2², so this would be 2^2 * (2^2)^2 = 2^2 * 2^4 = 2^6. Which is 64, not 48. So F is wrong.

Option G: 2 •24. 24 is 2^3 *3, so 2*24 is 2^4 *3. That's same as B. But again, G is written as 2 and 24, which aren't both primes. So it's not the prime factorization yet because 24 can be broken down further. So G isn't the prime factorization; it's just a factorization into primes and composites.

Option H: 4 •12. 4 is 2², 12 is 2²*3. So 4*12 is 2^4 *3, same as B. But H isn't using exponents in the answer, and also, 4 and 12 aren't primes. So not the correct form.

Option I: 3 •16. 16 is 2^4. So 3*16 is 2^4*3, same as B. But again, I is written as 3*16—16 isn't prime, so this isn't the prime factorization. So I is incorrect.

Option J: 2^4 •3^2. 2^4 is 16, 3^2 is 9. 16*9 is 144. That's way too big. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer is option B: 2^4 • 3.

To determine the prime factorization of 48, we break it down into prime numbers using the smallest primes first:

1. Divide 48 by 2: \(48 \div 2 = 24\)  
2. Divide 24 by 2: \(24 \div 2 = 12\)  
3. Divide 12 by 2: \(12 \div 2 = 6\)  
4. Divide 6 by 2: \(6 \div 2 = 3\)  

At this point, we have divided by 2 four times, resulting in \(2^4\), and are left with 3, which is a prime number. Thus, the prime factorization of 48 is \(2^4 \cdot 3\).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **A: \(4 \cdot 8\)**  
  \(4 = 2^2\) and \(8 = 2^3\), so this is \(2^5\), which equals 32. Incorrect.  

- **B: \(2^4 \cdot 3\)**  
  Matches the prime factorization of 48. Correct.  

- **C: \(6 \cdot 8\)**  
  \(6 = 2 \cdot 3\) and \(8 = 2^3\), so this is \(2^4 \cdot 3\). While mathematically correct, it does not use exponents as required. Incorrect.  

- **D: \(2^3 \cdot 3^2\)**  
  \(2^3 = 8\) and \(3^2 = 9\), so this equals 72. Incorrect.  

- **E: \(2^5 \cdot 3\)**  
  \(2^5 = 32\), so this equals 96. Incorrect.  

- **F: \(2^2 \cdot 4^2\)**  
  \(4 = 2^2\), so this becomes \(2^2 \cdot (2^2)^2 = 2^6 = 64\). Incorrect.  

- **G: \(2 \cdot 24\)**  
  \(24 = 2^3 \cdot 3\), so this is \(2^4 \cdot 3\). While mathematically correct, it does not use exponents as required. Incorrect.  

- **H: \(4 \cdot 12\)**  
  \(4 = 2^2\) and \(12 = 2^2 \cdot 3\), so this is \(2^4 \cdot 3\). While mathematically correct, it does not use exponents as required. Incorrect.  

- **I: \(3 \cdot 16\)**  
  \(16 = 2^4\), so this is \(2^4 \cdot 3\). While mathematically correct, it does not use exponents as required. Incorrect.  

- **J: \(2^4 \cdot 3^2\)**  
  \(3^2 = 9\), so this equals 144. Incorrect.  

The correct answer is **B: \(2^4 \cdot 3\)**.
