Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the molar ratio of lipids to proteins in a membrane. Hmm, let's see. The membrane is made up of 40% lipids by weight and 60% proteins. Wait, but the question is about molar ratio, so I think I need to convert the percentages by weight into moles.

Alright, the problem gives me the average molecular weights: lipids are 800 g/mol and proteins are 50,000 g/mol. So, I guess I should start by figuring out how many moles of each are present in a given sample.

Let me try to break it down. Suppose I have 100 grams of the membrane. That makes the calculations easier because the percentages directly translate to grams. So, 40 grams of lipids and 60 grams of proteins.

Moles are calculated by mass divided by molecular weight. So for lipids, that's 40g / 800 g/mol. Let me compute that: 40 divided by 800 is 0.05 moles. So, 0.05 moles of lipids.

For proteins, it's 60g / 50,000 g/mol. Hmm, 60 divided by 50,000. Let me see, 50,000 is 5e4. So 60 / 5e4 is 60/(5*10^4) )= (60/5)/10^4 = 12/10^4 = 0.0012 moles of proteins.

Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. 60 divided by 50,000. Let me calculate it again. 50,000 is 5 * 10^4. So 60 / 5e4 is 0.0012. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the molar ratio of lipids to proteins is the moles of lipids divided by moles of proteins. So 0.05 moles lipids / 0.0012 moles proteins.

Let me compute that. 0.05 divided by 0.0012. Hmm, 0.05 is 5e-2, and 0.0012 is 1.2e-3. So 5e-2 /1.2e-3 = (5/1.2) * (e-2 / e-3) = (approx 4.1667) * (10^(1)) ) because e-2 divided by e-3 is e1. So 4.1667 * 10^1 = 41.6667.

Wait, so that's about 41.67. Looking at the options, option F is 41.7. So that would be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes I get mixed up with the exponents.

So, 40 grams of lipid: 40/800 = 0.05 moles. 60 grams protein: 60/50,000 = 0.0012 moles. Molar ratio is 0.05 / 0.0012 = ? Let me compute it as numbers.

0.05 divided by 0.0012. Let's see, 0.0012 is 1.2e-3. So 0.05 is 5e-2. So 5e-2 / 1.2e-3 = (5/1.2) * 1e1 = (approx 4.1667) * 10 = 41.6667.

Yes, that's correct. So the ratio is about 41.7. So the correct option is F.

To calculate the molar ratio of lipids to proteins in the membrane, we start by assuming a 100 g sample for simplicity. The membrane contains 40 g of lipids and 60 g of proteins.

1. **Moles of lipids**:  
   The molecular weight of lipids is 800 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of lipids} = \frac{\text{Mass of lipids}}{\text{Molecular weight of lipids}} = \frac{40}{800} = 0.05 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

2. **Moles of proteins**:  
   The molecular weight of proteins is 50,000 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of proteins} = \frac{\text{Mass of proteins}}{\text{Molecular weight of proteins}} = \frac{60}{50,000} = 0.0012 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

3. **Molar ratio of lipids to proteins**:  
   The molar ratio is the ratio of moles of lipids to moles of proteins.  
   \[
   \text{Molar ratio} = \frac{\text{Moles of lipids}}{\text{Moles of proteins}} = \frac{0.05}{0.0012} = 41.67.
   \]

Thus, the molar ratio of lipids to proteins is approximately **41.7**, which corresponds to **option F**.
