Okay, so I've got this problem about a cast-iron flanged coupling used to join two steel shafts. The shafts are 2 and a half inches in diameter, and they deliver a maximum torque of 60 foot-pounds. The coupling halves are connected by 4 bolts placed equally on a bolt circle with a 3-inch diameter. The design stress for the bolts in shear is 10,000 psi. I need to find the diameter of the bolts from the given options.

Hmm, let me think about what I remember from mechanics. Torque is related to the force causing rotation, right? And when bolts are involved in a coupling like this, the torque creates a shearing force on the bolts.

Wait, torque (T) is equal to the force (F) multiplied by the radius (r) at which it's applied. But in this case, the bolts are arranged in a circle, so each bolt is at some radius from the center. The bolt circle diameter is 3 inches, so the radius for each bolt is 1.5 inches. That makes sense.

So the torque applied to the coupling is 60 ft-lb. But wait, units are in feet and inches, so I should probably convert that to inch-pounds because stress is in psi, which is pounds per square inch. Oh right, 1 foot is 12 inches. So 60 ft-lb is 60 * 12 = 720 inch-pounds.

Now, the torque is transmitted through the bolts. Since there are four bolts, each bolt will carry a portion of this torque. But wait, actually, each bolt is in shear, so the shear force on each bolt contributes to resisting the torque.

I think the total torque is the sum of the torque contributions from each bolt. Each bolt's torque is its shear force multiplied by the radius (1.5 inches). So T_total = 4 * (F_bolt * r). Because there are four bolts, each experiencing the same force.

Wait, let me write that out. T = n * F * r, where n is the number of bolts, F is the shear force per bolt, and r is the radius from the center to the bolt.

So rearranging that, F = T / (n * r)

Plugging the numbers in: T is 720 in-lb, n is 4, r is 1.5 inches. So F = 720 / (4 * 1.5) = 720 / 6 = 120 pounds-force per bolt. So each bolt must handle a shear force of 120 lbf.

But wait, the design stress is 10,000 psi in shear. Stress is force divided by area. So the allowable force per bolt is stress (s) multiplied by the cross-sectional area (A) of the bolt.

So F = s * A => A = F / s. The area is π * (d/2)^2, where d is the diameter of the bolt.

So A = π * (d^2)/4. So solving for d:

d = sqrt( (4 * F) / (π * s) )

Plugging the numbers in: F is 120 lbf, s is 10,000 psi.

So d = sqrt( (4 * 120) / (π * 10000) )

Calculate the numerator: 4 * 120 = 480.

Denominator: π * 10,000 ≈ 31415.93.

So 480 / 31415.93 ≈ 0.01527.

Taking the square root: sqrt(0.01527) ≈ 0.1236 inches.

Wait, let me double-check. Because 0.1236 squared is about 0.01527, yeah. So the diameter is approximately 0.1236 inches.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.1236 in. So I think that's the correct answer.

To determine the diameter of the bolts, we start by analyzing the torque and its relationship to the shear force on the bolts. The given torque is 60 ft-lb, which must be converted to inch-pounds: 

\[
T = 60 \, \text{ft-lb} \times 12 \, \text{in/ft} = 720 \, \text{in-lb}.
\]

The torque is transmitted through 4 bolts, and each bolt contributes to resisting the torque. The relationship between torque and shear force is:

\[
T = n \cdot F \cdot r,
\]

where \(n\) is the number of bolts, \(F\) is the shear force per bolt, and \(r\) is the radius of the bolt circle. The bolt circle diameter is 3 inches, so \(r = 1.5 \, \text{in}\). Rearranging for \(F\):

\[
F = \frac{T}{n \cdot r} = \frac{720}{4 \cdot 1.5} = \frac{720}{6} = 120 \, \text{lbf}.
\]

Each bolt must handle a shear force of 120 lbf. The design stress in shear is 10,000 psi, and stress is related to force and area by:

\[
F = s \cdot A \quad \Rightarrow \quad A = \frac{F}{s}.
\]

The cross-sectional area of a bolt is:

\[
A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4},
\]

where \(d\) is the bolt diameter. Substituting for \(A\):

\[
\frac{\pi d^2}{4} = \frac{F}{s} \quad \Rightarrow \quad d = \sqrt{\frac{4F}{\pi s}}.
\]

Substituting \(F = 120 \, \text{lbf}\) and \(s = 10,000 \, \text{psi}\):

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{4 \cdot 120}{\pi \cdot 10,000}} = \sqrt{\frac{480}{31415.93}} \approx \sqrt{0.01527} \approx 0.1236 \, \text{in}.
\]

Thus, the diameter of the bolts is approximately 0.1236 inches. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**F: 0.1236 in.**
