Okay, so I have this question in front of me about groups in mathematics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which of the given options is NOT a group. The options are labeled A through E, each describing a set and an operation.

First, I remember that a group must satisfy four main properties: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverses for each element. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: The integers under addition. I think this is a group. Integers are closed under addition, addition is associative, there's an identity element (which is 0), and every integer has an inverse (like -1 is the inverse of 1, etc.). So A is a group.

Option B: The positive real numbers under multiplication. Positive reals... when you multiply them, you stay within positive reals, so closure holds. Multiplication is associative. The identity element is 1. Each positive real has an inverse in the positive reals (like 1/n is the inverse of n). So B is a group.

Option C: The nonzero integers under multiplication. Wait, nonzero integers include both positive and negative, right? So let's check. Multiplication of nonzero integers is closed? Yes, because the product of two nonzero integers is nonzero. Associativity holds because integer multiplication is associative. What about identity? The identity element for multiplication is 1. But wait, are all elements invertible? The inverse of an integer n under multiplication would be 1/n. But 1/n is not an integer unless n is 1 or -1. So for example, take 2. Its inverse is 1/2, which is not in the set of nonzero integers. That means the inverse doesn't exist in the set. So this set doesn't have inverses for all elements. Therefore, it's not a group. Hmm, but wait, I should make sure I'm not missing anything. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing it up with something else. Because the set here is nonzero integers under multiplication. So the group would only be a group if every element has an inverse in the set. Since most don't, this isn't a group. So option C is not a group.

Option D: The complex numbers under addition. Complex numbers form a group under addition. Closure yes, addition is associative, identity is 0, and every complex number has an additive inverse (like a + bi has inverse -a - bi). So D is a group.

Option E: The nonzero real numbers under multiplication. This is a group too. Multiplication is closed, associative. Identity is 1. Every nonzero real has a reciprocal, which is also a nonzero real. So inverses exist. So E is a group.

So the question is which is NOT a group. From my analysis, option C is not a group because not all elements have inverses within the set. So the answer should be C.

The question asks which of the given options is NOT a group. To determine this, we analyze each option based on the group properties: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.

- **Option A**: The integers under addition form a group because they satisfy closure, associativity, have an identity element (0), and every integer has an inverse.

- **Option B**: The positive real numbers under multiplication form a group as they are closed under multiplication, multiplication is associative, the identity element is 1, and every positive real number has a reciprocal (inverse) in the set.

- **Option C**: The nonzero integers under multiplication do not form a group. While they are closed under multiplication and multiplication is associative, not all elements have inverses within the set. For example, the inverse of 2 under multiplication is 1/2, which is not an integer. Therefore, this set lacks the inverse property required for a group.

- **Option D**: The complex numbers under addition form a group because they are closed under addition, addition is associative, the identity element is 0, and every complex number has an additive inverse.

- **Option E**: The nonzero real numbers under multiplication form a group as they are closed under multiplication, multiplication is associative, the identity element is 1, and every nonzero real number has a reciprocal (inverse) in the set.

The only option that fails to satisfy all group properties is **Option C**. 

Answer: C
