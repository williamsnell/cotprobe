Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a rocket's acceleration. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that in the first second of flight, the rocket ejects 1/60 of its mass with a velocity of 6800 ft/sec. I need to find the rocket's acceleration. The options are given from A to J, so I'll have to calculate it.

Wait, I remember there's a formula related to rockets and their acceleration. Oh right, the rocket equation. I think it's something like acceleration equals the exhaust velocity times the mass flow rate divided by the remaining mass, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Oh wait, the basic idea is that the rocket's acceleration comes from the thrust produced by ejecting mass. Thrust is the force, which is mass flow rate times exhaust velocity. Then, acceleration is thrust divided by the rocket's current mass.

But wait, how's the mass changing here? The problem says the rocket ejects 1/60 of its mass in one second. So the mass flow rate is (1/60) of the initial mass per second. Let me denote the initial mass as M. So the mass ejected per second is M/60 per second, which is (M/60) kg/s. Wait, but since the problem is in ft and sec, I think the units are in the English system, but maybe it doesn't matter for the calculation as long as I'm consistent.

Wait, actually, in the first second, it ejects 1/60 of its mass. So the mass flow rate (dm/dt) is M/60 per second. Because in one second, it loses M/60 mass. So dm/dt = M/60 (but since it's being ejected, the flow rate is negative, but I think in the formula we take the magnitude).

The exhaust velocity is given as 6800 ft/s. So, the thrust F is equal to the exhaust velocity v_e multiplied by the mass flow rate dm/dt. So F = v_e * (dm/dt).

Then, the acceleration a of the rocket is F divided by the instantaneous mass of the rocket. But wait, the mass at time t is M minus the mass that's been ejected. But in this case, the problem is looking at the first second, so the mass is changing as it ejects. Hmm, but when calculating acceleration, do I use the initial mass or the average mass over that second, or the instantaneous mass at some point?

Wait, the formula I remember is the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, which deals with the change in velocity, but here we're dealing with acceleration. Oh wait, maybe the formula for acceleration is a = (v_e * (dm/dt)) / (M - dm), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think for small time intervals, we can approximate using the initial mass.

Alternatively, the correct formula for the acceleration of a rocket is a = v_e * (dm/dt) / m, where m is the mass of the rocket at that moment. But since the mass is changing, perhaps we can model it as the average mass during that interval.

Wait, let me think again. The rocket equation in terms of acceleration is a = (v_e * (dm/dt)) / (m), where m is the current mass. But since the problem is over a one-second interval, and it's asking for the acceleration during that interval, perhaps we can take an average. Wait, but maybe the acceleration isn't constant because as the mass decreases, the acceleration increases.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the initial mass and the given data. Let me consider that approach.

The mass flow rate is (1/60)M per second, so dm/dt = M/60. The exhaust velocity is 6800 ft/s. So the thrust F is 6800 * (M/60).

Then, the acceleration a would be F divided by the mass. Wait, but which mass? The mass at the start of the interval is M. But during the interval, the mass decreases as it ejects some. So perhaps to get the average acceleration, we could use the average mass over that second.

The initial mass is M. After one second, the mass is M - (M/60) = (59/60) M. So the average mass during that second is (M + (59/60 M)) / 2 = (1 + 59/60)/2 * M = (119/60)/2 M = (119/120) M ≈ 0.9917 M.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem treats it as using the initial mass, M, to compute the acceleration. Because the change in mass is relatively small (only 1/60), maybe the approximation using M is acceptable.

Wait, but let's see. Let me think in terms of calculus. The acceleration at any time t is a = v_e * (dm/dt) / m(t). Since dm/dt is constant (assuming the mass is ejected at a constant rate), then dm/dt = -dM/dt = (M_initial - M_final)/Δt. Wait, in this problem, Δt is 1 second, and M_ejected is M_initial /60.

So dm/dt = (M_initial /60) / 1 = M_initial / 60 per second. But since it's being expelled, dm/dt is negative, but we'll take the magnitude for thrust.

So the thrust F is v_e * (dm/dt) = 6800 ft/s * (M_initial /60) per second.

Wait, but the units don't make sense. Let me check: 6800 ft/s multiplied by M_initial/(60 s) would give F in units of (ft/s)*(M/s) = ft*M/s². Wait, that's not right. Wait, because M_initial is in slugs (if we're using imperial units), since in the English system, mass is in slugs and force is in pounds (lbf), and acceleration is ft/s².

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let's think about the units more carefully. The formula F = v_e * (dm/dt) is correct, but the units must match. Let's see:

v_e is in ft/s. dm/dt is in mass per second (slug/s). So when you multiply ft/s by slug/s, you get ft*slug/s². Now, in imperial units, 1 pound (force) is equal to 1 slug-ft/s². So ft*slug/s² is equal to (ft*slug/s²) = (1/s) * (slug*ft/s²) ) = (1/s) * pound. So F would be in pounds per second. Wait, that doesn't make sense because force should be in pounds, not per second.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should express the mass flow rate in terms of mass per second, so dm/dt has units of slug/s.

Wait, let me check: in the formula F = v_e * (dm/dt), F is in force units, which in imperial is pounds-force (lbf). v_e is in ft/s. dm/dt is in slug/s. So the product v_e * dm/dt is (ft/s) * (slug/s) = (ft * slug) / s². Since 1 lbf = 1 slug*ft/s², then (ft * slug)/s² = (slug*ft/s²) ) * (1/s) = (lbf) * (1/s). Hmm, that suggests that F is in lbf/s, which doesn't make sense because force should be in lbf. So perhaps the formula needs a correction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The correct formula for thrust is indeed F = v_e * (dm/dt). But let's make sure about the units.

In SI units, dm/dt is in kg/s, v_e in m/s, so F is in kg*m/s², which is Newtons, correct. So in imperial, F would be (slug/s) * ft/s = (slug*ft)/(s²). Since 1 lbf = 1 slug*ft/s², then F = (slug*ft/s²) = lbf. So the formula works.

Wait, so 1 slug*ft/s² is 1 lbf. So (slug/s) * ft/s = (slug*ft)/(s²) = lbf. So the units work out.

So, F = v_e * (dm/dt) = 6800 ft/s * (M_initial /60) slug/s.

Wait, wait, no. Because M_initial is the initial mass in slugs. So dm/dt is (M_initial /60) slugs per second. So F = 6800 ft/s * (M_initial /60) slugs/s.

Hmm, but that would give F in units of (ft/s) * (slugs/s) = (ft*slug)/s², which is lbf, correct.

So F = (6800) * (M_initial /60) = (6800/60) * M_initial lbf.

Now, the acceleration a is F divided by the current mass. But the current mass is changing. At t=0, the mass is M_initial. After one second, it's M_initial - M_initial/60 = (59/60) M_initial.

So the mass during the first second is somewhere between M_initial and (59/60) M_initial. So to find the average acceleration, perhaps we should use the average mass over that interval.

The average mass would be (M_initial + (59/60 M_initial)) / 2 = (1 + 59/60)/2 * M_initial = (119/60)/2 M_initial = (119/120) M_initial ≈ 0.9917 M_initial.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that acceleration is calculated using the initial mass, which would be a simplification.

So, if we proceed with the initial mass, then a = F / M_initial.

F is (6800/60) * M_initial lbf.

So a = (6800/60) * M_initial lbf / M_initial. Oh wait, the M_initial cancels out.

So a = (6800/60) ft/s².

Wait, because lbf divided by slug gives ft/s². Because F = ma, so a = F/m. F is in lbf, m in slugs. So a is in ft/s².

Wait, yes. Because 1 lbf = 1 slug * 1 ft/s². So 1 lbf / 1 slug = 1 ft/s².

So, F = (6800/60) M_initial lbf.

Then, a = F / M_initial = (6800 /60) ft/s².

6800 divided by 60 is 6800/60 = 113.333... ft/s².

Wait, but that's not one of the answer options. The closest option is A: 110.3, but that's lower. Hmm. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the mass after the ejection. So, perhaps using the final mass for a, but that doesn't make sense because the mass is decreasing.

Wait, wait. Let me re-calculate 6800 divided by 60.

6800 ÷ 60: 60*113=6780, so 6800-6780=20. So 113 + 20/60 = 113.333... So 113.333 ft/s².

But looking at the options, the highest is I:95.5, which is lower than 113. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the mass flow rate is not M_initial/60, but (1/60) per second. Wait, no, the problem states that in the first second, 1/60 of its mass is ejected. So if the initial mass is M, then in one second, it ejects M/60, so dm/dt is M/(60) slugs per second.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using the mass after ejection as the current mass. So, the acceleration would be a = v_e * (dm/dt) / (M - dm). Because during the first second, the rocket's mass becomes M - M/60 = (59/60) M.

So, F = v_e * (dm/dt) = 6800 * (M/60) = (6800/60) M lbf.

Then, a = F / (M - dm) = (6800/60 M) / (59/60 M) ) = (6800/60) / (59/60) ) = 6800/59 ≈ 115.254 ft/s².

Hmm, that's closer to option A:110.3, but not exactly. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate more accurately.

Wait, 6800 divided by 59 is approximately:

59*115 = 6785. So 6800-6785=15. So 115 + 15/59 ≈ 115.254.

Still not matching any option exactly. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the acceleration is given by a = v_e * (dm/dt) / m, where m is the initial mass. But that would give me 6800/60 = 113.333 ft/s², which isn't an option either.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 110.3, which is close to 6800/(60 + 1), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the mass ratio differently.

Wait, perhaps the total mass ejected is 1/60 of the initial mass, so the mass ratio is (M + (1/60)M) / M = 1 + 1/60 = 61/60, but I don't think that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing mass flow rate with something else. Let me think again.

Wait, the rocket equation for acceleration is a = v_e * (dm/dt) / m. Since dm/dt is the rate of mass ejection, which is M/60 per second. So, a = (v_e) * (dm/dt) / m.

But m is the current mass. At t=0, m = M. After one second, m = M - M/60.

But wait, the acceleration at t=0 would be a_initial = v_e * (dm/dt) / M.

Which is 6800 * (M/60) / M = 6800/60 = 113.333 ft/s².

But that's not among the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as taking the average mass over the second. So, the average mass would be (M + (M - M/60)) / 2 = (M + (59M/60)) / 2 = (60M +59M)/(60*2) )= (119M)/(120) ≈ 0.9917 M.

So, the average acceleration would be F / average mass.

F is still 6800*(M/60) lbf.

So a_avg = (6800*(M/60)) / (0.9917 M) ) = (6800/60) /0.9917 ≈ 113.333 / 0.9917 ≈ 114.3 ft/s².

Still not matching any option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the acceleration is given by the equation a = v_e * ln((m_initial)/(m_final)) / delta_t.

Wait, that rings a bell. The change in velocity delta_v is v_e ln(m_initial/m_final), but that's over the time interval. So delta_v = v_e ln(m_initial/(m_initial - dm)), and acceleration a_avg would be delta_v / delta_t.

Wait, let's try this approach.

In one second, the mass decreases by 1/60 of initial mass. So m_initial = M, m_final = M - M/60 = (59/60) M.

So delta_v = v_e ln(M / (59/60 M)) ) = v_e ln(60/59).

So a_avg = delta_v / delta_t = (v_e ln(60/59)) / 1.

Compute ln(60/59): 60/59 is approximately 1.016949. The natural log of that is about 0.0168.

So delta_v ≈ 6800 ft/s * 0.0168 ≈ 114.24 ft/s.

So a_avg ≈ 114.24 ft/s².

Again, this doesn't match any of the options. Hmm. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different formula, such as a = (v_e / (M)) * (dm/dt) * delta_t, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the problem is using the relation between the exhaust velocity and the acceleration considering the mass loss.

Wait, another formula I recall is that the acceleration a is equal to (v_e) * (1/tau), where tau is the time it would take to burn all the fuel at the given rate. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is a = (v_e) * (dm/dt) / (M - dm). Wait, but I tried that earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula a = v_e * (1 - (m_final/m_initial)) / (m_initial * delta_t). No, I don't think so.

Wait, let's try another approach. Let me think about the definition of acceleration. The acceleration is the change in velocity over time, so a = delta_v / delta_t.

But how much delta_v do we get in that one second?

Using the rocket equation, delta_v = v_e * ln(m_initial / m_final).

So m_initial is M, m_final is M - (M/60) = (59/60) M.

Thus, delta_v = 6800 * ln(60/59) ≈ 6800 * 0.0168 ≈ 114.24 ft/s.

Thus, acceleration a = 114.24 / 1 = 114.24 ft/s². Again, not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is delta_v = v_e * (m_initial / m_final - 1) / (1 + (m_initial / m_final)).

No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of momentum. The thrust is the force applied, so F = delta_p / delta_t.

The momentum change delta_p is (mass_ejected) * exhaust_velocity. So in one second, the mass ejected is M/60, so delta_p = (M/60) * 6800 lb-ft/s (but I'm not sure about the units here).

Wait, momentum is mass times velocity. So delta_p would be (M/60) * 680
