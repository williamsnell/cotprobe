Question:

A developer is the owner of a parcel of land in fee simple absolute (the record title is also in the developer). The parcel of land is and has been unpossessed land. Assume that each person listed below as the grantee in a deed paid value and took without actual notice of any facts that would defeat her title and without knowledge of any facts that would put her on inquiry, both at the time she took her deed and at the time she recorded it. The following conveyances, each by a general warranty deed, take place in the order listed: An artist conveys to a bartender; the developer conveys to the artist; the artist conveys to a counselor; the bartender conveys to a dentist; the counselor conveys to an engineer. No deed was recorded until after the artist-to- counselor deed was executed and then before the execution of any other deed, the order of recording was as follows: developer to artist; artist to bartender; artist to counselor. The bartender-to-dentist deed and counselor-to- engineer deed were each recorded immediately after their respective executions. The owner of the parcel of land in a notice jurisdiction is

Options:

A: the artist.
B: the engineer.
C: the developer.
D: the dentist.
E: all of the above.
F: the developer and the artist jointly.
G: the bartender.
H: the counselor and the engineer jointly.
I: none of the above.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see. The question is about determining the current owner of a parcel of land in a notice jurisdiction. There are several conveyances happening, so I need to untangle the chain of title and figure out who ends up with the property.

First, let's lay out the facts as given. The developer owns the land in fee simple absolute. The parcel has been unpossessed, which probably means no one is occupying it, but I don't think that affects the title directly. The key here is the sequence of conveyances and when they were recorded.

The conveyances happen in this order:

1. Artist conveys to Bartender.
2. Developer conveys to Artist.
3. Artist conveys to Counselor.
4. Bartender conveys to Dentist.
5. Counselor conveys to Engineer.

But the recording happens in a different order. So, after the Artist-to-Counselor deed, the recording happens as follows:

- Developer to Artist is recorded first.
- Then Artist to Bartender.
- Then Artist to Counselor.

Then, the Bartender-to-Dentist and Counselor-to-Engineer deeds are recorded immediately after they were executed.

The jurisdiction is a notice jurisdiction. I remember that in notice jurisdictions, a subsequent purchaser who takes without notice of a prior unrecorded deed will take priority over the earlier grantee. But if someone has notice, either actual or constructive (like through inquiry), they might not prevail.

Wait, but in this question, each grantee paid value and took without actual notice and without knowledge that would put them on inquiry, both when they took the deed and when they recorded. So, none of them had any notice of prior claims when they took their deeds.

Now, let's map out the timeline and recording. Let me make a table to track when each conveyance happened and when it was recorded.

Conveyance Order:

1. Artist → Bartender (let's call this Deed 1)
2. Developer → Artist (Deed 2)
3. Artist → Counselor (Deed 3)
4. Bartender → Dentist (Deed 4)
5. Counselor → Engineer (Deed 5)

Recording Order after Deed 3:

- Deed 2 (Developer→Artist) recorded first.
- Then Deed 1 (Artist→Bartender) recorded.
- Then Deed 3 (Artist→Counselor) recorded.
- Deed 4 (Bartender→Dentist) recorded immediately after Deed 4 was executed.
- Deed 5 (Counselor→Engineer) recorded immediately after Deed 5 was executed.

Wait, but the actual execution order is important because recording happens after, but the sequence matters for priority.

I think I need to figure out the chain of ownership, considering the recording dates and whether each subsequent purchaser had notice.

Let me think about the possible interests each person has.

Starting with the developer, who owns the land. The first conveyance is Artist to Bartender (Deed 1). But wait, the developer hasn't conveyed to the Artist yet. So, when the Artist conveys to the Bartender (Deed 1), does the Artist have any ownership to convey? No, because the developer hasn't conveyed to the Artist yet. So, the Artist can't transfer good title at that point. So, Deed 1 is a wild deed, maybe? Because the Artist didn't own the property when they conveyed to the Bartender.

Then, the Developer conveys to the Artist (Deed 2). Now, the Artist gets ownership from the Developer. So, from that point, the Artist owns the property, but wait, because the Artist had already conveyed to the Bartender in Deed 1, which was before Deed 2. Hmm, but in reality, you can't convey what you don't own. So, when the Artist conveyed to the Bartender (Deed 1), the Artist didn't have title yet, so that conveyance would be invalid. The Bartender would have gotten nothing because the Artist had nothing to give.

But then, when the Developer conveys to the Artist (Deed 2), the Artist now owns the property. Then, the Artist conveys to the Counselor (Deed 3). So, the Counselor gets ownership from the Artist, but let's check the recording.

Now, recording order after Deed 3 is:

- Deed 2 (Developer→Artist) recorded first.
- Then Deed 1 (Artist→Bartender) recorded.
- Then Deed 3 (Artist→Counselor) recorded.

So, when Deed 2 is recorded, it's the first in the records. Then Deed 1 is recorded, which is Artist to Bartender. Then Deed 3 is recorded, Artist to Counselor.

Wait, but Deed 1 was executed before Deed 2. But since it's a notice jurisdiction, the subsequent purchaser's rights depend on when they took without notice.

Let me clarify the timeline with approximate times:

- Time 1: Artist conveys to Bartender (Deed 1). But Artist has no title yet. So, this is a wild deed; Bartender gets nothing.

- Time 2: Developer conveys to Artist (Deed 2). Now, Artist owns the property.

- Time 3: Artist conveys to Counselor (Deed 3). So, Counselor now owns it, assuming Artist had title.

- Time 4: Bartender conveys to Dentist (Deed 4). But Bartender had a deed from Artist before the Artist got title, so Bartender has nothing to convey. So, Dentist gets nothing.

- Time 5: Counselor conveys to Engineer (Deed 5). If Counselor had good title, then Engineer gets it.

But wait, the recording matters for the priority. Because in a notice jurisdiction, a later purchaser who records first and without notice can take priority over an earlier purchaser who didn't record yet.

So, when Deed 2 is recorded first, that's the Developer to Artist. Then Deed 1 is recorded, which is Artist to Bartender. Then Deed 3 is recorded, Artist to Counselor.

Let me think about each grantee's situation:

1. Bartender (from Deed 1): At the time of conveyance (Time 1), the Artist didn't own the property yet, so Bartender gets nothing. Even when Deed 1 is recorded later, it's after Deed 2, which shows that the Artist got title after Deed 1. So, the Bartender's claim would be invalid because the Artist had nothing to give at that time.

2. Artist (from Deed 2): At the time of conveyance (Time 2), the Developer conveyed to the Artist, giving them title. So, the Artist now owns it. When the Artist later conveys to the Counselor (Deed 3), that's valid because the Artist had title by then.

3. Counselor (from Deed 3): The Counselor took the deed from Artist after Artist had title. So, the Counselor would have a valid claim. Now, when does the Counselor record? After Deed 3, but the recording order is Deed 2, then Deed 1, then Deed 3. So, when Deed 3 is recorded, it's after the Artist's ownership is recorded.

Wait, but let me consider the effect of recording on the chain. When the Developer conveys to Artist (Deed 2), and that's recorded first, so anyone searching the records after that would see that the Artist owns the property.

Then, Deed 1 (Artist to Bartender) is recorded. But since it's after Deed 2, someone searching would see that the Artist had title, and then conveyed it to Bartender. But wait, that's not correct because Deed 1 actually happened before Deed 2. So, in reality, when the records show Deed 2 first, then Deed 1, it looks like the Artist got title and then conveyed to Bartender. But in reality, the Artist conveyed to Bartender before getting the title. So, does that mean the Bartender's deed is invalid because the Artist didn't have title at the time of Deed 1.

So, the Bartender's deed is a wild deed, and when the Developer later conveys to the Artist (Deed 2), that's when the Artist gets title, making the Bartender's claim invalid.

Then, the Artist conveys to the Counselor (Deed 3), which is valid because now the Artist has title.

Now, when the recording happens: Deed 2 is recorded first, so the public record shows that the Developer conveyed to the Artist. Then, Deed 1 is recorded, showing Artist to Bartender. But since Deed 1 was executed before Deed 2, when someone is searching the records, they might think that the Artist had title when they conveyed to Bartender, but in reality, the Artist didn't have title then. So, would that affect the validity of Deed 1? I think it's still a wild deed because at the time of execution, the Artist didn't have title.

So, the Bartender's deed is invalid, meaning the Bartender has no ownership. So, when the Bartender conveys to the Dentist (Deed 4), the Dentist gets nothing because the Bartender had nothing to convey.

Now, moving on to Deed 3, which is Artist to Counselor. Since the Artist had title when they conveyed to the Counselor, this is a valid conveyance. The Counselor's deed is recorded after the Artist's ownership is recorded, so the Counselor's title is properly recorded.

Then, the Counselor conveys to the Engineer (Deed 5), and that's recorded immediately. So, the Engineer would get title from the Counselor.

Wait, but the question is about the current owner. So, let's track the ownership step by step.

- Initially, Developer owns it.

- Deed 1: Artist → Bartender (invalid, Artist had no title yet).

- Deed 2: Developer → Artist (valid, Artist now owns).

- Deed 3: Artist → Counselor (valid, Counselor now owns).

- Deed 4: Bartender → Dentist (invalid, Bartender has nothing).

- Deed 5: Counselor → Engineer (valid, Engineer now owns).

So, the last conveyance is Engineer getting it from Counselor. So, the Engineer would be the current owner.

But let me double-check the recording and its impact. In a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent bona fide purchaser (BFP) for value without notice will prevail over prior unrecorded interests.

When the Artist conveys to the Counselor (Deed 3), and then records it, but the recording order is after Deed 2 and Deed 1.

Wait, when the Developer conveys to Artist (Deed 2) and records it first, that's public. Then, when the Artist conveys to the Counselor (Deed 3), the Counselor, when taking the deed, would have checked the records and saw that the Artist had title (from Deed 2). So, the Counselor takes without notice of any prior claims, as the records only show the Artist as owner. So, the Counselor is a BFP and takes the title cleanly.

Then, when the Counselor conveys to Engineer (Deed 5), and that's recorded immediately, so Engineer takes from a valid owner.

But wait, what about the Bartender's deed (Deed 1) being recorded after Deed 2? So, Deed 1 is recorded after Deed 2 and before Deed 3.

So, when Deed 1 is recorded, it shows that the Artist conveyed to Bartender, but because Deed 1 was executed before Deed 2, it's a wild deed. So, when the records show that after the Developer conveyed to Artist (Deed 2), the Artist then conveyed to Bartender (Deed 1), but in reality, the conveyance happened in the reverse order.

So, would a subsequent purchaser, like the Counselor, have notice of the Bartender's deed when they take their deed?

Wait, the Counselor takes Deed 3 after the Artist has title, but before any conveyance to the Bartender is recorded. Because the recording order is: Deed 2, then Deed 1, then Deed 3.

So, when the Artist conveys to the Counselor (Deed 3), the records have Deed 2 recorded, but Deed 1 hasn't been recorded yet. So, when the Counselor takes the deed, they would check the records and see that the Artist owns the property (from Deed 2), with no other conveyances recorded. So, the Counselor has no notice of the Bartender's claim because it's not recorded yet. Therefore, the Counselor is a BFP and takes the title cleanly.

After that, Deed 1 is recorded, showing Artist to Bartender, but that's after the Counselor has already taken the deed. Since the Bartender's deed is recorded after the Counselor's, the Counselor's interest would have priority because they were a BFP without notice when they took the deed.

So, the ownership after all conveyances would be: Engineer, because they took from the Counselor, who had valid title.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's outline each step:

1. Deed 1: Artist → Bartender (invalid, as Artist had no title yet).

2. Deed 2: Developer → Artist (valid, Artist now owns).

3. Deed 3: Artist → Counselor (valid, Counselor owns).

   At the time of Deed 3, the records only have Deed 2 recorded, so the Counselor has no notice of any prior claims and is a BFP.

4. Deed 4: Bartender → Dentist (invalid, Bartender has nothing).

5. Deed 5: Counselor → Engineer (valid, Engineer owns).

So, the Engineer is the current owner.

Looking at the options, option B is the Engineer. Option I is none of the above, but that's not the case here.

Wait, but let me think again about the recording. The question says that after the Artist-to-Counselor deed (Deed 3) was executed, the recording happened in the order: Developer to Artist, then Artist to Bartender, then Artist to Counselor. So, the recording of Deed 3 happens after the recording of Deed 2 and Deed 1.

So, when the Counselor records Deed 3, the records already have Deed 2 (Developer→Artist) and Deed 1 (Artist→Bartender). So, would that affect the Counselor's status?

Wait, no. Because the recording of Deed 1 (Artist→Bartender) happens after the Counselor has already taken Deed 3. So, when the Counselor took Deed 3, the only recorded deed was Deed 2 (Developer→Artist), because the recording of Deed 1 and Deed 3 happened after the execution of Deed 3.

Wait, the timeline is:

- Execute Deed 1 (A→B) at Time 1.

- Execute Deed 2 (D→A) at Time 2.

- Execute Deed 3 (A→C) at Time 3.

Then, the recording starts:

- Record Deed 2 (D→A) first.

- Then record Deed 1 (A→B).

- Then record Deed 3 (A→C).

So, when Deed 3 is being recorded, the records already have Deed 2 and Deed 1 recorded before Deed 3. So, when the Engineer later records Deed 5 (C→E), they would have the chain showing D→A→B, but also A→C→E.

Wait, but the Engineer's deed is recorded immediately after execution, which is after the recording of Deed 3. So, Engineer's recording would come after all the previous recordings.

But in any case, the key is that when the Counselor took Deed 3, they had no notice because the only recorded deed was Deed 2, showing Artist as owner. The Deed 1 was recorded after the Counselor took their deed, so the Counselor didn't have notice of the Bartender's claim.

Therefore, the Counselor's title is valid, and when they convey to the Engineer, the Engineer gets good title.

So, the current owner is the Engineer.

Looking at the options, option B is the Engineer.

In this scenario, the developer initially owns the parcel of land in fee simple absolute. The conveyances occur in the following order:

1. **Artist → Bartender (Deed 1)**: At the time of this conveyance, the Artist did not yet own the property because the Developer had not yet conveyed it. As a result, this is a "wild deed," and the Bartender acquires no ownership interest.

2. **Developer → Artist (Deed 2)**: The Developer conveys the property to the Artist, giving the Artist valid ownership.

3. **Artist → Counselor (Deed 3)**: The Artist, now the rightful owner, conveys the property to the Counselor. At the time of this conveyance, the Counselor has no notice of any prior claims (e.g., the Bartender's deed) because the Bartender's deed (Deed 1) has not yet been recorded. Thus, the Counselor is a bona fide purchaser (BFP) and acquires valid title.

4. **Bartender → Dentist (Deed 4)**: The Bartender, having acquired no ownership interest from the Artist (as Deed 1 was invalid), conveys nothing to the Dentist. This deed is therefore ineffective.

5. **Counselor → Engineer (Deed 5)**: The Counselor, having valid title, conveys the property to the Engineer. This conveyance is valid, and the Engineer acquires ownership.

The recording order is as follows:

- **Deed 2 (Developer → Artist)** is recorded first.
- **Deed 1 (Artist → Bartender)** is recorded next.
- **Deed 3 (Artist → Counselor)** is recorded after that.
- **Deed 4 (Bartender → Dentist)** and **Deed 5 (Counselor → Engineer)** are recorded immediately after their executions.

In a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser who takes without notice of prior unrecorded deeds and pays value will prevail. The Counselor, as a BFP, took the property without notice of the Bartender's deed (Deed 1), which was not recorded at the time of the Artist-to-Counselor conveyance. Therefore, the Counselor's title is valid, and the Engineer, as the Counselor's grantee, ultimately acquires ownership of the property.

The current owner of the parcel is the **Engine
