Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the expansion of air when heated near a thermonuclear explosion. Oh right, I remember something about gases expanding when heated. I think it has to do with the ideal gas law or maybe Charles's Law.

The question says that one cubic foot of air is heated from 0°C to 546,000°C. I need to find out to what volume it expands. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Okay, so first, I should probably recall Charles's Law. Charles's Law states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature when pressure is held constant. The formula is V1/T1 = V2/T2, right? But wait, the temperatures need to be in Kelvin because gas laws require absolute temperatures.

So the initial temperature T1 is 0°C. Converting that to Kelvin, I add 273.15. So T1 = 0 + 273.15 = 273.15 K. The final temperature T2 is 546,000°C. Converting that, T2 = 546,000 + 273.15. Let's see, that's 546273.15 K approximately.

The initial volume V1 is 1 cubic foot. We're looking for V2, the final volume.

So plugging into Charles's Law: V1/T1 = V2/T2. Rearranging to solve for V2 gives V2 = V1 * (T2 / T1).

Substituting the numbers, V2 = 1 ft³ * (546273.15 K) / (273.15 K). Let me compute that. 

Wait, 546273 divided by 273.15... Let me approximate. Since 273.15 times 2000 is 546300, which is a bit more than 546273. So 546273 / 273.15 ≈ 2000? Because 273.15 * 2000 is 546300, which is just 27 more than 546273. So approximately 2000 - (27/273.15). Let me compute 27 divided by 273.15. 273.15 is about 273, so 27/273 is about 0.0988. So about 2000 - 0.0988 ≈ 1999.9. So approximately 2000.

Wait wait, but wait a second. Oh, because 273.15 * 2000 is 546300, which is 546,300 K. But our T2 is 546,000 + 273.15 = 546,273.15 K. So T2 is 546,273.15, which is 26.85 K less than 546,300. So how much is that in terms of the division.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let me do it step by step.

T2 = 546,000°C = 546000 + 273.15 = 546273.15 K.

T1 is 273.15 K.

So V2 = 1 * (546273.15 / 273.15) = 546273.15 / 273.15.

Let me compute that division. Let's see:

Divide numerator and denominator by 273.15.

But wait, 546273.15 divided by 273.15 is the same as (546000 + 273.15)/(273.15) = 546000/273.15 + 273.15/273.15 = (546000/273.15) + 1.

Calculating 546000 / 273.15. Let me compute 546000 ÷ 273.15.

I can approximate this. Let's see, 273.15 is roughly 273. So 546000 /273 ≈ let's calculate that.

Well, 273 * 2000 = 546,000. So 273*2000=546,000. So 546,000/273 = 2000 exactly. So 546,000 / 273.15 is approximately 2000, but a little less because the denominator is slightly larger than 273.

Wait no, denominator is 273.15. Wait, 273.15 is 0.15 more than 273. So 546000 / 273.15 is slightly less than 2000. Let's compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 273.15 * 1999 = ?

Well, 273.15 * 2000 = 546,300.

So 273.15 * 1999 = 546,300 - 273.15 = 546,026.85.

But our numerator is 546,273.15. So 1999 gives 546,026.85, which is less than 546,273.15. The difference is 546,273.15 - 546,026.85 = 246.3.

So how much more than 1999 is needed to get to 546,273.15? Let's compute how many times 273.15 fits into 246.3.

So 246.3 / 273.15 ≈ 0.899 times. So approximately 1999.9.

So 546,273.15 / 273.15 ≈ 1999.9.

So V2 ≈ 1999.9 ft³. Approximately 2000.

Looking at the options, none of the options is exactly 2000. Let me look.

The options are:

A: 3000 ft^3

B:7500 

C:1000 

D:2730 

E:500 

F:4000 

G:546000 

H:6000 

I:2001 

J:1500.

Wait, option I is 2001, which is very close to 2000. So perhaps the exact calculation would give 2000, but considering the exact values, maybe it's a bit more.

Wait, did I make a mistake in my calculation? Let me check again.

Wait, T2 is 546,273.15 K.

V2 = 1 * (546273.15 / 273.15) = 546273.15 / 273.15.

Let me compute this precisely.

Divide both numerator and denominator by 273.15:

= (546273.15 / 273.15) 

= (546273.15 ÷ 273.15) 

Let me compute 273.15 × 2000 = 546300. So 546273.15 is 546300 - 26.85.

So 546273.15 = 273.15 × 2000 - 26.85.

So 546273.15 / 273.15 = (2000 × 273.15 - 26.85) / 273.15 

= 2000 - (26.85 / 273.15) 

26.85 divided by 273.15 is approximately 0.0983.

So 2000 - 0.0983 ≈ 1999.9017.

So V2 ≈ 1999.9 ft³, which is approximately 2000 ft³.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 2001 ft³. Hmm, but why 2001? Is there a more precise calculation?

Wait, maybe I should do the exact division.

Compute 546273.15 / 273.15.

Let me write it as (546273.15) / (273.15) = ?

Let me compute this division step by step.

We can write both numerator and denominator multiplied by 100 to eliminate decimals.

So, 54627315 / 27315.

Hmm, let's compute 54627315 ÷ 27315.

Let me see, 27315 × 2000 = 54,630,000. 

Now, subtract 54,630,000 from 54,627,315. Wait, no, wait, 54,627,315 is less than 54,630,000. So 54,627,315 is 2,685 less than 54,630,000.

So 54,627,315 = 27315 × (2000) - 2685.

So, 54,627,315 ÷ 27315 = 2000 - (2685 / 27315).

Compute 2685 ÷ 27315.

2685 ÷ 27315 = (2685 ÷ 27315) = 0.09826.

So approximately 2000 - 0.09826 = 1999.90174.

So around 1999.9017, which is approximately 2000.

So the correct V2 is approximately 2000 ft³.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 2001 ft³. Hmm, perhaps due to rounding during calculations, the exact answer might be 2000, but since that's not an option, 2001 is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used the exact temperature conversion. Let me double-check that.

Wait, 0°C is 273.15 K, and 546,000°C is 546,000 + 273.15 = 546,273.15 K. So that was correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate 0°C as 273 K, so T1=273, T2=546,273, so T2/T1 = 546,273 / 273 ≈ 2000. So 2000 times the volume. So 1 cubic foot becomes 2000 ft³.

So the expected answer would be 2000, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 2000, but in the options, I have option I as 2001. Or maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

I: 2001 ft^3.

Hmm, perhaps the precise calculation gives 1999.9, which is approximately 2000. But none of the options is 2000. Option I is 2001, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. Wait, wait, wait a second. Charles's Law assumes constant pressure, right? But in a thermonuclear explosion, the pressure might not be constant. Oh, but the question doesn't mention pressure, so I think it's safe to assume constant pressure. So Charles's Law should apply.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the ideal gas law, considering pressure and number of moles. But without knowing pressure, it's not possible. So yes, Charles's Law is the way to go.

Wait, maybe I should compute the ratio again. Let me compute T2/T1 exactly.

T2 = 546000 + 273.15 = 546273.15 K.

T1 = 273.15 K.

So T2/T1 = 546273.15 / 273.15.

Let me compute 546273.15 ÷ 273.15.

Let me compute this division:

273.15 × 2000 = 546300. So 273.15 × 1999 = 546300 - 273.15 = 546026.85.

But our T2 is 546273.15. So 546273.15 - 546026.85 = 246.3.

So 246.3 ÷ 273.15 = approximately 0.9017.

So total multiplier is 1999 + 0.9017 ≈ 1999.9017.

So V2 = 1999.9017 ft³, which is very close to 2000, but the options don't include 2000. So the closest option is I: 2001.

Wait, but let me check if any of the other options are close. For example, option D is 2730, which is T1 × 10. That can't be right. Option H is 6000, which would mean T2 is 6000 × 273.15. No, that's way higher.

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to use Celsius instead of Kelvin? No, that can't be right, because in gas laws, you have to use absolute temperatures.

Wait, let me try that just to see. Suppose someone makes the mistake of using Celsius instead of Kelvin. Then T1 is 0, T2 is 546000. So V2 = (546000 / 0) * 1 ft³. Oh wait, division by zero, which is undefined, so that wouldn't make sense. So definitely, using Kelvin is correct.

Hmm. So I think the correct answer should be approximately 2000, which isn't an option. The closest is option I, 2001. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses T1 as 273 and T2 as 546273, so 546273 /273 = exactly 2000.07. So approximately 2000.07, which would round to 2000. But again, the options don't have 2000, only 2001 is close.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me try another approach. Let's compute 273.15 × 2000 = 546300. So T2 is 546273.15, which is 26.85 less than 546300. So 26.85 is how much in terms of 273.15.

26.85 / 273.15 ≈ 0.0983. So 2000 - 0.0983 = 1999.9017.

So V2 is approximately 1999.9, which is about 2000. So the options don't have 2000, but I have 2001 as option I. So perhaps due to rounding, the correct answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is D: 2730. Wait, 2730 is 273 ×10. Hmm, wait, 546000 is 2000 × 273, but 2730 is 10 × 273. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is V1/T1 = V2/T2. So V2 = V1 * T2 / T1.

Wait, that's what I did. So I think my calculation is correct.

So the answer should be approximately 2000 ft³, but since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the options have a typo, but that's unlikely.

Wait, looking back at the options, option I is 2001, which I think is the intended correct answer. So I'll choose I.
</think>

To determine the volume to which one cubic foot of air expands when heated from 0°C to 546,000°C, we use Charles's Law, which states:

\[
\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}
\]

Here:
- \( V_1 = 1 \, \text{ft}^3 \) (initial volume),
- \( T_1 = 0 + 273.15 = 273.15 \, \text{K} \) (initial temperature in Kelvin),
- \( T_2 = 546,000 + 273.15 = 546,273.15 \, \text{K} \) (final temperature in Kelvin),
- \( V_2 \) is the final volume to be calculated.

Rearranging Charles's Law to solve for \( V_2 \):

\[
V_2 = V_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
V_2 = 1 \cdot \frac{546,273.15}{273.15}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
V_2 \approx 1999.9 \, \text{ft}^3
\]

This is approximately \( 2000 \, \text{ft}^3 \). However, since \( 2000 \, \text{ft}^3 \) is not one of the provided options, the closest match is:

**Option I: 2001 ft³**

Thus, the correct answer is:

I
