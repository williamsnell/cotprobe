Okay, so I've got this problem here about scaling models in wind and water tunnels. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on fluid mechanics, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that a one-fifth scale model of an airplane is tested in a wind tunnel and a water tunnel. We need to calculate the tunnel speeds required to match a full-scale speed of 100 fps at sea level. Oh right, I remember something about similitude and Reynolds numbers here.

Wait, Reynolds number similarity is key for dynamic scaling. Reynolds number (Re) is given by (velocity × length) / kinematic viscosity. For the model and prototype to be similar, their Re numbers should be equal. So Re_model = Re_prototype.

The scale model is 1/5th the size, so the length scale Lr is model length over prototype length, which is 1/5. Since Re is velocity × length / ν, I can set up the equation as:

V_model * L_model / ν_model = VPrototype * LPrototype / νPrototype.

Wait, but wait. The prototype is the real airplane, which is in air at sea level. The model is in the tunnel, so when testing in the wind tunnel, the fluid is air, same as the prototype. But for the water tunnel, the fluid is water, so the properties are different.

Let me break this down into two cases: (a) wind tunnel and (b) water tunnel.

Case (a): Wind tunnel (both model and prototype in air)
So for the wind tunnel, ν_model is the same as νPrototype because it's the same fluid. So the equation becomes Vm * Lm / ν = Vp * Lp / ν. The ν cancels out.

So Vm = Vp * (Lp / Lm). Since Lm is 1/5 Lp, this becomes Vm = Vp * 5. Because 1/(1/5) is 5. So Vm = 5 * 100 fps = 500 fps. Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 500 fps for part (a), but let me check the other case.

Case (b): Water tunnel. Now, the model is in water, and the prototype is in air. So the fluids are different. So the equation is Vm_water * Lm / ν_water = Vp_air * Lp / ν_air.

We know Lm = Lp /5, so Vm_water = Vp * (Lp/(Lm)) * (ν_water / ν_air) ) 

Wait, let me get that equation correctly. Let me write it again.

V_model / V_prototype = (L_prototype / L_model) * (ν_model / ν_prototype)

Because Re_model = Re_prototype, so:

Vm * Lm / νm = Vp * Lp / νp → Vm = Vp * (Lp / Lm) * (νm / νp )

Wait, let's make sure. Let's rederive it:

Re_model = Re_prototype → (Vm Lm / νm) = (Vp Lp / νp )

Solving for Vm:

Vm = (Vp Lp νm ) / ( Lm νp )

Since Lm = Lp /5 → Lp =5 Lm.

Substituting:

Vm = (Vp *5 Lm * νm ) / ( Lm * νp )

The Lm cancels, so Vm = 5 Vp * (νm / νp )

Wait, but wait. Let me check the substitution again. Because Lp =5 Lm, so Lp =5 Lm → Lp/Lm =5.

So Vm = Vp * (Lp/Lm) * (νm/νp )

Yes, so Vm = 5 Vp * (νm / νp )

Now, Vp is 100 fps. So for the water tunnel, νm is the kinematic viscosity of water, and νp is that of air.

Wait, but wait. Wait, in the tables, are they giving dynamic viscosity μ or kinematic viscosity ν?

Looking back at the problem, Table 1 gives "Liquid Sp gr μ ×10^5 lb-sec/ft²". So μ is dynamic viscosity. Similarly, Table 2 gives for gases, same μ. But kinematic viscosity ν is μ/ρ, where ρ is the density.

So to get ν, I need to compute μ/(ρ), for both fluids.

Wait, for the prototype (air at sea level), from Table 2, air has μ_air = 0.0378e-5 lb-sec/ft². Wait, wait, the table says μ ×1e5 lb-sec/ft². So for air, μ is 0.0378 ×1e-5? Wait, let me read the header correctly: "μ ×10^5 lb-sec/ft^2". So the value given is μ ×1e5. So to get μ, we divide by 1e5.

Wait, correction: for example, for air in Table 2, μ ×1e5 is 0.0378 lb-sec/ft². So μ_air = 0.0378 / 1e5 = 3.78e-7 lb-sec/ft².

Similarly, for water, from Table 1, μ_water ×1e5 is 2.09 lb-sec/ft², so μ_water = 2.09e-5 lb-sec/ft².

But wait, we also need the density for each fluid. For air, from Table 2, ρ_air is 0.00238 slug/ft³. For water, from Table 1, we can get the specific gravity (sp gr), which is the ratio of the liquid's density to water's density. Wait, but in Table 1, for water, fresh, sp gr is 1.0. So the density of water is 1.0 times the density of water. Hmm, but what is the actual value? Oh wait, maybe I can take the density of water as 62.4 lb/ft³ (since 1 slug/ft³ is about 32 lb/ft³, wait no, let me think again.

Wait, 1 slug is 32.174 lb·s²/ft. So density in slugs per cubic foot is ρ = mass/volume, in slugs/ft³.

Wait, the density of water is about 62.4 lb/ft³, which is 62.4 / 32.174 ≈ 1.94 slug/ft³. Because 32.174 lb·s²/ft is 1 slug. So 62.4 lb/ft³ is (62.4 /32.174 ) slugs/ft³ ≈ 1.94 slugs/ft³.

So for water, from Table 1, the specific gravity is 1.0, which means its density is 62.4 lb/ft³. So ρ_water = 62.4 lb/ft³.

Wait, but in Table 2, for air, the density is given as 0.00238 slug/ft³. Let me convert that to lb/ft³ to make units consistent. Since 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft, so 1 slug/ft³ is 32.174 lb/ft³. So 0.00238 slug/ft³ is 0.00238 *32.174 ≈ 0.0765 lb/ft³.

Wait, but for air, the density is about 0.0765 lb/ft³, which sounds right. And water is about 62.4 lb/ft³.

Now, going back to calculating ν (kinematic viscosity) which is μ/ρ.

For the model in water, ν_water = μ_water / ρ_water.

μ_water is 2.09e-5 lb-sec/ft² (from Table 1: μ ×1e5 =2.09 → μ =2.09e-5).

ρ_water is 62.4 lb/ft³.

So ν_water = (2.09e-5 lb-sec/ft²) / (62.4 lb/ft³) → units would be ft²/s.

Calculating that: 2.09e-5 /62.4 = approx 3.35e-7 ft²/s.

Similarly, for air, ν_air = μ_air / ρ_air.

μ_air is 0.0378e-5 lb-sec/ft² → 3.78e-7 lb-sec/ft².

ρ_air is 0.0765 lb/ft³.

So ν_air = 3.78e-7 / 0.0765 ≈ 4.94e-6 ft²/s.

Wait, let me do precise calculations.

Compute ν_water:

μ_water = 2.09e-5 lb-sec/ft².

ρ_water =62.4 lb/ft³.

ν_water = 2.09e-5 / 62.4 = (2.09 /62.4) * 1e-5.

2.09 /62.4 ≈ 0.0335.

So 0.0335e-5 → 3.35e-7 ft²/s.

ν_air = 3.78e-7 lb-sec/ft² / 0.0765 lb/ft³.

3.78e-7 / 0.0765 → approx 4.94e-6 ft²/s.

Ok, now plug into the equation for Vm_water:

Vm_water =5 * Vp * (ν_water / ν_air )

Vp is 100 fps.

So Vm_water =5 *100 * (3.35e-7 /4.94e-6 )

Calculate the ratio: 3.35e-7 /4.94e-6 ≈ 0.0678.

So 5 *100 *0.0678 =5 *6.78=33.9 fps.

Wait, but let me check the numbers again. Maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, 3.35e-7 /4.94e-6 → let's compute it as (3.35 /4.94) *1e-1 → because 1e-7 /1e-6 =1e-1.

3.35 /4.94 ≈0.678 → 0.678 *0.1 =0.0678.

So yes, that's correct.

So Vm_water ≈33.9 fps.

Looking at the options, option J is 510, 33.2; option I is 500, 34.2. Option E is 400,30.2; Option A:600,40.2.

Wait, but wait, our calculation for wind tunnel was 500 fps (option I's first part is 500, second is 34.2). But for the water tunnel, we calculated about 33.9, which is close to 34. But looking at the options, let's see which has Vm_wind =500, Vm_water≈34.

Option I: (a)500 fps, (b)34.2. That's very close.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to mix up the ratios.

Let me recheck the equation for Vm_water.

Vm_water =5 *100 * (ν_water / ν_air )

ν_water is 3.35e-7, ν_air is 4.94e-6.

Ratio= 3.35e-7 /4.94e-6 = 3.35/(494) ) → 3.35/494 ≈ 0.00678. Wait wait, no, 3.35e-7 /4.94e-6 = (3.35/4.94) * (1e-7 /1e-6) ) → (0.678) *0.1=0.0678.

So 5*100 *0.0678= 33.9, which is about 34.

So the wind tunnel speed is 500 fps, water tunnel speed is approximately 34 fps.

Looking back at the options, option I says (a) 500 fps, (b)34.2 fps. That's spot on.

Wait, but earlier I thought the wind tunnel would be 500, which matches option I. So the correct answer would be option I.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscalculate the ν values.

Wait, for ν_air, I had 3.78e-7 /0.0765.

Wait, 3.78e-7 divided by 0.0765.

Let me compute this again.

3.78e-7 / 0.0765 → 3.78e-7 = 0.000000378.

Divide by 0.0765:

0.000000378 / 0.0765 = approx 0.00000494 → which is 4.94e-6 ft²/s. That's correct.

And ν_water was 3.35e-7 ft²/s.

So the ratio is 3.35e-7 /4.94e-6 = 0.0678.

So yes, 5*100*0.0678=33.9.

So option I is 500 and 34.2, which is very close.

Looking at the options, option I is (a)500 fps, (b)34.2 fps.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option I.
</think>

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the tunnel speeds required to match a full-scale speed of 100 fps at sea level for a one-fifth scale model tested in (a) a wind tunnel and (b) a water tunnel. The key principle is Reynolds number similarity, which requires that the Reynolds numbers of the model and prototype be equal:

\[
\text{Re}_{\text{model}} = \text{Re}_{\text{prototype}}
\]

The Reynolds number is given by:

\[
\text{Re} = \frac{V \cdot L}{\nu}
\]

Where \(V\) is velocity, \(L\) is length, and \(\nu\) is kinematic viscosity. For the model and prototype:

\[
\frac{V_{\text{model}} \cdot L_{\text{model}}}{\nu_{\text{model}}} = \frac{V_{\text{prototype}} \cdot L_{\text{prototype}}}{\nu_{\text{prototype}}}
\]

### Case (a): Wind Tunnel
In the wind tunnel, both the model and prototype are in air, so \(\nu_{\text{model}} = \nu_{\text{prototype}}\). The equation simplifies to:

\[
V_{\text{model}} = V_{\text{prototype}} \cdot \frac{L_{\text{prototype}}}{L_{\text{model}}}
\]

Since the model is one-fifth the size of the prototype (\(L_{\text{model}} = \frac{L_{\text{prototype}}}{5}\)), we have:

\[
V_{\text{model}} = 5 \cdot V_{\text{prototype}}
\]

Substituting \(V_{\text{prototype}} = 100 \, \text{fps}\):

\[
V_{\text{model}} = 5 \cdot 100 = 500 \, \text{fps}
\]

### Case (b): Water Tunnel
In the water tunnel, the model is in water, and the prototype is in air. The equation becomes:

\[
V_{\text{model}} = V_{\text{prototype}} \cdot \frac{L_{\text{prototype}}}{L_{\text{model}}} \cdot \frac{\nu_{\text{model}}}{\nu_{\text{prototype}}}
\]

Here, \(\nu_{\text{model}}\) and \(\nu_{\text{prototype}}\) are the kinematic viscosities of water and air, respectively. From the tables:

- \(\mu_{\text{water}} = 2.09 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{lb-sec/ft}^2\), \(\rho_{\text{water}} = 62.4 \, \text{lb/ft}^3\), so:

\[
\nu_{\text{water}} = \frac{\mu_{\text{water}}}{\rho_{\text{water}}} = \frac{2.09 \times 10^{-5}}{62.4} \approx 3.35 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s}
\]

- \(\mu_{\text{air}} = 0.0378 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{lb-sec/ft}^2\), \(\rho_{\text{air}} = 0.0765 \, \text{lb/ft}^3\), so:

\[
\nu_{\text{air}} = \frac{\mu_{\text{air}}}{\rho_{\text{air}}} = \frac{0.0378 \times 10^{-5}}{0.0765} \approx 4.94 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{ft}^2/\text{s}
\]

The ratio of kinematic viscosities is:

\[
\frac{\nu_{\text{water}}}{\nu_{\text{air}}} = \frac{3.35 \times 10^{-7}}{4.94 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 0.0678
\]

Substituting into the equation for \(V_{\text{model}}\):

\[
V_{\text{model}} = 5 \cdot 100 \cdot 0.0678 \approx 33.9 \, \text{fps}
\]

### Final Answer
For the wind tunnel, the required speed is \(500 \, \text{fps}\), and for the water tunnel, the required speed is approximately \(34.2 \, \text{fps}\). Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**Option I: 500 fps, 34.2 fps**
