Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about collective security, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is, "What is the meaning of collective security?" with options A through J. I remember that collective security has something to do with multiple countries working together, but I'm not exactly sure of the specifics. Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A says it's the establishment of a mutual defense pact among several nations. Hmm, mutual defense pacts, like NATO maybe? I think NATO is a collective defense alliance where members agree to defend each other if one is attacked. But is that the same as collective security? Maybe, but I'm not certain. I remember that collective security is more about a broader group, like the United Nations, rather than just a specific alliance.

Option B is about a nation's right to defend itself without outside help. That sounds more like self-defense as per international law, not collective security. So I can probably rule this out.

Option C mentions the UN Security Council authorizing armed force. That does sound familiar. The UN often authorizes peacekeeping missions or interventions, which could be a form of collective security. I think when the UN Security Council approves using force, it's a collective action to maintain peace and security.

Option D is about humanitarian missions authorized by the UN. While the UN does do humanitarian work, I'm not sure if that's the core of collective security. Collective security is more about preventing aggression between states, maybe.

Option E says it's the right of allies to defend a victim state. That seems similar to a mutual defense pact again, like NATO, but not the broader collective approach. So maybe E is not the correct answer.

Option F is about sanctions authorized by the UN Security Council. Sanctions are a tool used by the UN to enforce decisions, but is that the definition of collective security? I think collective security involves more than just sanctions; it's about collective action to prevent or respond to threats.

Option G talks about the right to self-defense by multiple nations acting together. That sounds a bit like collective defense, but I think collective security is a system where the international community acts together against any aggression, not just self-defense by a group.

Option H suggests a nation invading another for its security. That doesn't sound right. Invading another country isn't about security; it's more about aggression, which goes against the idea of collective security.

Option I is about peacekeeping missions authorized by the General Assembly. Wait, I thought the Security Council handles peacekeeping, not the General Assembly. Plus, peacekeeping is a part of collective security, but is it the definition?

Option J is about creating a global police force by the UN. The UN doesn't have a police force in that sense, but it does authorize missions. So J doesn't seem correct.

So, going back, the core concept of collective security is that the international community, usually through an organization like the UN, acts collectively against any aggressive acts. So when the Security Council authorizes action, that's a form of collective security. That points me towards option C.

Wait, but I also remember that collective security isn't just about using armed force. It's a system where an attack on one is seen as an attack on all, leading to a collective response. But in the context of the options given, option C seems to fit because the UN Security Council's authorization is a key part of that system.

Alternatively, option A is about mutual defense pacts, which are more like alliances. So maybe A is also a form of collective security, but I think the broader, more formalized system through the UN would be the primary definition.

So, after thinking it through, I think the correct answer is A? Wait, no. Wait, the question is about the meaning of collective security, which is more about the system where the international community as a whole responds, not just a mutual defense pact between some nations.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing collective defense with collective security. Collective defense is like NATO, where member states agree to mutual defense. Collective security is more like the UN system where all member states collectively take action against any aggressor.

So, in that case, the correct answer would relate to the UN taking action. Looking back, option C is the authorization of armed force by the UN Security Council. That makes sense because when the UN acts, it's a collective response.

So I think the answer is C.

The concept of collective security refers to a system where the international community, often through an organization like the United Nations, collectively responds to threats or aggression. This is distinct from mutual defense pacts, which are agreements between specific nations or alliances. Among the options provided, the authorization of armed force by the UN Security Council (Option C) aligns most closely with the definition of collective security, as it represents a collective action to maintain international peace and security.

Answer: C
