Okay, so I have this question about calculating the standard electrode potential (E°) of a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrochemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of H₂O(l) as -56,690 cal/mole. Wait, I remember that the formula connecting Gibbs free energy and cell potential is ΔG° = -nFE°, right? So I can use that to find E°.

But wait, let me make sure I have everything straight. The hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell is like a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell, where hydrogen is the fuel and oxygen is the oxidant. The cell reaction is probably 2 H₂ + O₂ → 2 H₂O. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the cell reaction is 2 H₂ (g) + O₂ (g) → 2 H₂O (l). I think. Because in a fuel cell, hydrogen is oxidized, and oxygen is reduced.

Now, the standard Gibbs free energy change for the cell reaction is the ΔG° for the formation of water. But wait, the given value is for the formation of H₂O from its elements, which is exactly the reaction we're looking at. Oh wait, no: the formation is H₂(g) + ½ O₂(g) → H₂O(l). So the ΔG°f for water is -56,690 cal per mole. But our cell reaction is producing 2 moles of H₂O. So the total ΔG° for the cell reaction is 2*(-56,690) cal.

Wait, let me clarify. The standard Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔG°f) is for one mole of the product from its elements in their standard states. So for each mole of H₂O, ΔG°f is -56,690 cal. So for two moles, it would be twice that, which is -113,380 cal.

But wait, the formula is ΔG°cell = -n F E°. So I need to find n, the number of moles of electrons transferred.

In the hydrogen-oxygen reaction, each H₂ molecule provides two electrons (since each H has an oxidation state of 0 in H₂ and +1 in H₂O). So for each H₂, it's 2 electrons. Since there are 2 H₂ molecules in the reaction, that's 2 * 2 = 4 electrons total. So n is 4.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The oxidation of hydrogen: H₂ → 2 H+ + 2 e⁻. So each H₂ gives 2 electrons. In the cell reaction, there are 2 H₂ molecules, so 2 * 2 = 4 electrons. So n is 4.

Wait, but I've also heard that n is the number of moles of electrons per mole of reaction. So yes, in the reaction as written (for 2 H₂O), we have 4 electrons.

So putting it all together: ΔG°cell = -n F E°

We have ΔG°cell as -113,380 cal. Wait, wait: the ΔG° for the cell is the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction, which is 2*(-56,690) = -113,380 cal.

So plug into the equation: -113,380 cal = -n F E°.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because the signs can be tricky. Let me write the equation correctly. The formula is ΔG° = -n F E°, so rearranging, E° = -ΔG° / (n F).

Wait, no: the formula is ΔG° = -n F E°, so solving for E°: E° = -ΔG°/(n F). But wait, wait. Let's make sure of the signs.

ΔG° is negative for a spontaneous reaction, which a fuel cell is. So when ΔG° is negative, E° should be positive.

So let's compute E° as (-ΔG°) / (n F). Because ΔG° is negative, so -ΔG° is positive.

So let's compute.

ΔG° for the cell reaction is -113,380 cal. So -ΔG° is +113,380 cal.

Now, n is 4, F is the Faraday constant. Wait, but wait, what unit is F in? Because calories are involved here.

Faraday's constant, F, is 23,060 cal/(V·mol). Wait, no, wait—Faraday's constant is 23,060 cal/(V·mol) when using calories. Because 1 cal is 4.184 joules, and F is about 96,485 C/mol. But since we're using calories, let me confirm.

Wait, actually, I think F is 96,485 coulombs per mole. But when using the equation with ΔG in calories, we can use F in cal units. So 1 F = 23,060 cal/(V·mol). Because 1 volt * 1 coulomb = 1 joule. So 96,485 C/mol * (1 J / 1 C) * (1 cal / 4.184 J) ≈ 23,060 cal/(V·mol). So yes.

So F is 23,060 cal/(V·mol).

So putting it all together:

E° = (113,380 cal) / (4 * 23,060 cal/(V·mol))

Let me compute the denominator: 4 * 23,060 = 92,240.

So E° = 113,380 / 92,240 ≈ 1.229 volts.

Wait, but let me compute that. 113380 divided by 92240.

Let me compute 113380 ÷ 92240.

92240 * 1.229 = ?

Wait, perhaps a quick calculation:

92240 * 1.2 = 110,688.

Then 92240 * 0.229 is approximately:

92240 * 0.2 = 18,448

92240 * 0.02 = 1,844.8

92240 * 0.009 = 830.16

Adding 18,448 + 1,844.8 = 20,292.8 + 830.16 = 21,122.96.

So 1.2 times is 110,688, and 0.229 times is 21,122.96. Total 131,810.96, which is higher than 113,380. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm mixing up something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute 113380 ÷ 92240.

Let me do the division:

92240 goes into 113380 once (92240), subtract that from 113380 gives 21,140 remaining.

Bring down a zero: 211,400. Now, how many times does 92240 go into 211400?

Approximately 2 times (2*92240=184,480) → 211400-184480=26920.

Bring down another zero: 269200.

92240 goes into 269200 about 2 times (2*92240=184480) → 269200-184480=84720.

Bring down another zero: 847200.

92240 × 9 = 829, 160 (because 92240 *9 = 92,240 *10=922400 -92,240=830,160). Wait, no, 92240 * 9 = 92,240 ×9 = 830, 160? Let me compute:

92,240 *9:

90,000 *9=810,000.

2,240 *9=20,160.

Total is 810,000 +20,160=830,160.

But 847,200 is bigger than 830,160. So 9 times, which leaves 847,200 -830,160=17,040.

So up to this point, the division gives 1.229... because the quotient is 1.229...

So E° ≈ 1.229 V.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.229 V. So the answer is F.

To calculate the standard electrode potential (E°) of the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell, we use the relationship between Gibbs free energy and cell potential:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = -n F E^\circ
\]

### Step 1: Reaction and Gibbs Free Energy
The cell reaction for the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell is:

\[
2 H_2 (g) + O_2 (g) \rightarrow 2 H_2O (l)
\]

The standard Gibbs free energy of formation (\(\Delta G^\circ_f\)) of \(H_2O(l)\) is given as \(-56,690 \, \text{cal/mole}\). Since the reaction produces 2 moles of \(H_2O\), the total \(\Delta G^\circ\) for the reaction is:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = 2 \times (-56,690) = -113,380 \, \text{cal}
\]

### Step 2: Number of Electrons Transferred
In the oxidation of hydrogen, each \(H_2\) molecule donates 2 electrons, and there are 2 moles of \(H_2\) in the reaction. Thus, the total number of moles of electrons transferred (\(n\)) is:

\[
n = 2 \times 2 = 4
\]

### Step 3: Faraday's Constant
Faraday's constant (\(F\)) in units of \(\text{cal/(V·mol)}\) is approximately:

\[
F = 23,060 \, \text{cal/(V·mol)}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \(E^\circ\)
Rearranging the formula \(\Delta G^\circ = -n F E^\circ\) to solve for \(E^\circ\):

\[
E^\circ = -\frac{\Delta G^\circ}{n F}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
E^\circ = -\frac{-113,380}{4 \times 23,060} = \frac{113,380}{92,240} \approx 1.229 \, \text{V}
\]

### Final Answer
The standard electrode potential of the hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell is approximately \(1.229 \, \text{V}\). Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**F: 1.229 V**
