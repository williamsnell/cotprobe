Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. 

The question is asking how many liters of phosphine (PH3) gas can be made at STP from 30 grams of calcium using a series of reactions. I remember that STP usually means standard temperature and pressure, which is 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atmosphere. At STP, one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 liters. So that's probably going to come into play here.

Looking at the reactions provided:

First reaction: 3Ca + 2P → Ca3P2. So calcium reacts with phosphorus to form calcium phosphide.

Second reaction: Ca3P2 + 6HCl → 2PH3 + 3CaCl2. So calcium phosphide reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce phosphine gas and calcium chloride.

Alright, the plan is to find out how much PH3 we can get from 30 grams of Ca. So I think I need to start by converting the mass of calcium to moles, then track through the reactions to find moles of PH3, and then use the molar volume at STP to find the volume.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate moles of Ca from 30g.
2. Using the first reaction, find moles of Ca3P2 produced.
3. Then use the second reaction to find moles of PH3.
4. Finally, convert moles of PH3 to liters at STP.

Starting with step 1: Moles of Ca.

The atomic weight of Ca is given as 40 g/mol. So moles of Ca = mass / molar mass = 30g / 40 g/mol = 0.75 moles of Ca.

Step 2: Reaction 1: 3Ca → 1 Ca3P2. So the mole ratio is 3 moles Ca to 1 mole Ca3P2.

So moles of Ca3P2 = moles of Ca * (1 mole Ca3P2 / 3 moles Ca) ) = 0.75 * (1/3) = 0.25 moles of Ca3P2.

Wait, that makes sense because 3 moles of Ca make 1 mole of Ca3P2, so 0.75/3 is 0.25.

Step 3: Reaction 2: 1 mole Ca3P2 → 2 moles PH3.

So moles of PH3 = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5 moles PH3.

Wait, so 0.5 moles of PH3.

Then step 4: Volume at STP is moles * 22.4 L/mol.

So 0.5 * 22.4 L = 11.2 liters.

Looking at the options, option A is 11.2 L.

Wait, but let me double-check everything because sometimes moles can be tricky.

Wait, in the first reaction, 3 Ca gives 1 Ca3P2. So 30g Ca is 0.75 moles Ca. 0.75 /3 = 0.25 moles Ca3P2. Correct.

Second reaction: 1 mole Ca3P2 gives 2 moles PH3. So 0.25 * 2 = 0.5 moles PH3. Right.

0.5 moles *22.4 L/mol = 11.2 L. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Are there any stoichiometric issues I missed? Let's make sure.

In reaction one, the molar ratio is 3 Ca to 1 Ca3P2. So yes, correct.

Reaction two: 1 Ca3P2 to 2 PH3. So correct.

So yes, 0.5 moles PH3 gives 11.2 L at STP.

To determine how many liters of phosphine (PH₃) gas can be produced at STP from 30 g of calcium, we follow these steps:

1. **Convert the mass of calcium to moles**:  
   The molar mass of calcium (Ca) is 40 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ca} = \frac{\text{Mass of Ca}}{\text{Molar Mass of Ca}} = \frac{30 \, \text{g}}{40 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.75 \, \text{mol}
   \]

2. **Use the first reaction to find moles of Ca₃P₂**:  
   The reaction is \( 3\text{Ca} + 2\text{P} \rightarrow \text{Ca₃P₂} \).  
   From the stoichiometry, 3 moles of Ca produce 1 mole of Ca₃P₂.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ca₃P₂} = \text{Moles of Ca} \times \frac{1 \, \text{mol Ca₃P₂}}{3 \, \text{mol Ca}} = 0.75 \times \frac{1}{3} = 0.25 \, \text{mol}
   \]

3. **Use the second reaction to find moles of PH₃**:  
   The reaction is \( \text{Ca₃P₂} + 6\text{HCl} \rightarrow 2\text{PH₃} + 3\text{CaCl₂} \).  
   From the stoichiometry, 1 mole of Ca₃P₂ produces 2 moles of PH₃.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of PH₃} = \text{Moles of Ca₃P₂} \times \frac{2 \, \text{mol PH₃}}{1 \, \text{mol Ca₃P₂}} = 0.25 \times 2 = 0.5 \, \text{mol}
   \]

4. **Convert moles of PH₃ to liters at STP**:  
   At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L.  
   \[
   \text{Volume of PH₃} = \text{Moles of PH₃} \times 22.4 \, \text{L/mol} = 0.5 \times 22.4 = 11.2 \, \text{L}
   \]

Thus, the volume of phosphine gas produced is **11.2 liters**.
