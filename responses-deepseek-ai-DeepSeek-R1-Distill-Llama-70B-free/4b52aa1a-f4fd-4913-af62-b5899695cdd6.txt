Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron in a one-dimensional box. Hmm, I remember that the energy levels in such a box are quantized. The question says that an electron transitions from an excited state to the ground state, emitting a photon with a certain wavelength. I need to find the quantum number of the initial state.

Alright, let's break this down. The box has a length of 2.00 Å, which is 2.00 angstroms. Oh wait, I should convert that to meters because the standard unit for these calculations is meters. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 2.00 Å is 2e-10 m.

The transition emits a photon with a wavelength of 8.79 nm. Wavelength in nanometers, so again, I need to convert that to meters. 1 nm is 1e-9 m, so 8.79 nm is 8.79e-9 meters.

I think the energy of the photon emitted is equal to the difference in energy between the two states. So, E_photon = E_initial - E_ground.

The energy levels in a 1D box are given by the formula E_n = (n² h²) / (8 m L²), where n is the quantum number, h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the electron, and L is the length of the box.

But wait, I remember that Planck's constant h can also be written as 4.135667696e-15 eV·s, but wait no, more accurately, h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Oh right, but sometimes in these problems, it's more convenient to use the value in terms of eV and nanometers, but maybe I should just stick with J.

Wait, but to find the energy of the photon, I can use E = hc / λ. Oh yeah, that's the formula for the energy of a photon. So E_photon = (h c) / λ.

Wait, let me get the constants right. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. Speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So putting those numbers in, I can calculate E_photon.

Let me compute that. So h is 6.626e-34, c is 3e8 m/s, and λ is 8.79e-9 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (8.79e-9).

Let me calculate that step by step. Multiply 6.626e-34 by 3e8 first. 6.626 *3 is about 19.878, so 19.878e-26. Then divide by 8.79e-9.

Wait, 19.878e-26 divided by 8.79e-9 is equal to (19.878 /8.79) * 1e-17.

Calculating 19.878 /8.79. Let me see: 8.79 times 2 is 17.58, so 2 with a remainder. 19.878 -17.58 is about 2.298. So 2.298 /8.79 is approximately 0.261. So total is about (2 + 0.261) = 2.261. So 2.261e-17 J.

Wait, that's a very small number, which makes sense because it's the energy of a photon.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the exponents. Let me redo the calculation more carefully.

E_photon = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (8.79e-9 m)

Multiply numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = (6.626 *3) * 1e(-34+8) = 19.878e-26 J·m.

Then divide by 8.79e-9 m: 19.878e-26 / 8.79e-9 = (19.878 /8.79) * 1e-17 J.

So 19.878 /8.79: let's compute that.

8.79 * 2 = 17.58. Subtract from 19.878: 19.878 -17.58 = 2.298.

2.298 /8.79 ≈ 0.261.

So total is 2.261e-17 J. So E_photon ≈ 2.261e-17 J.

Now, the energy levels in a 1D box are given by E_n = (n² h²) / (8 m L²). Wait, but I can relate the photon's energy to the transition between energy levels.

So E_initial - E_ground = E_photon.

E_initial is E_n, and E_ground is E_1, since n=1 is the ground state.

So E_n - E_1 = E_photon.

We can write E_n = E_1 * n², because E_n is proportional to n squared. So E_n - E_1 = E_1 (n² -1) = E_photon.

So E_1 (n² -1) = E_photon.

I need to compute E_1 first. E_1 is the ground state energy.

E_1 = (h²) / (8 m L²). Wait, let me write that down.

E_1 = (h²) / (8 m_e L²).

Where m_e is the mass of the electron. Let me get the constants right.

h is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J·s.

m_e is 9.109e-31 kg.

L is 2e-10 m.

So E_1 = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * 9.109e-31 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 )

Hmm, that's going to be a calculation. Let me compute it step by step.

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 * 1e-68.

6.626 squared is approximately 43.91 (since 6^2=36, 0.626^2≈0.391, and cross terms 2*6*0.626=7.512; so 36 +7.512 +0.391 ≈43.903). So about 43.903e-68 J²·s².

Denominator: 8 * 9.109e-31 * (2e-10)^2.

Compute each part:

8 * 9.109e-31 = 7.2872e-30.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

Multiply them: 7.2872e-30 * 4e-20 = 29.1488e-50 kg·m².

So denominator is 29.1488e-50.

So E_1 = numerator / denominator = (43.903e-68) / (29.1488e-50) )

Which is (43.903 / 29.1488) * 1e-18.

Calculating 43.903 /29.1488 ≈ approximately 1.506.

So E_1 ≈ 1.506e-18 J.

Wait, that's E_1, the ground state energy.

Now, the photon energy is E_photon = 2.261e-17 J.

So according to E_photon = E_1 (n² -1 ), we can write:

2.261e-17 J = 1.506e-18 J * (n² -1 )

Divide both sides by 1.506e-18 J:

(2.261e-17) / (1.506e-18) = n² -1

Compute that: 2.261e-17 /1.506e-18 = (2.261 /1.506 ) * 1e1.

2.261 /1.506 is approximately 1.501.

So 1.501 *10 = approx 15.01.

So 15.01 = n² -1.

So n² = 16.01.

n is the square root of that, which is about 4.00 (since 4^2=16).

Wait, but 4.00 exactly. So n=4.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes approximations can be tricky.

So rechecking E_photon.

E_photon = hc/λ.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

c=3e8 m/s.

λ=8.79e-9 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 *3e8) /8.79e-9.

Compute numerator:6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 8.79e-9 m:

1.9878e-25 /8.79e-9 = approx 2.261e-17 J. That seems correct.

E_1 was calculated as approx 1.506e-18 J.

Then (E_photon / E_1) = (2.261e-17 )/(1.506e-18 )= approx 15.01.

So 15.01 = n² -1 → n²=16.01 → n=4.

Wait, but wait—that would imply that the transition is from n=4 to n=1. So the initial state is n=4. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options: D is 4. So the answer would be D.

But wait, wait a second. Let me recheck the calculations, because sometimes I might mix up exponents.

Let me recalculate E_1.

E_1 = h²/(8 m_e L²).

h =6.626e-34.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2= approx 43.9e-68 → correct.

Denominator: 8 m_e L^2.

m_e=9.109e-31 kg.

L=2e-10 m, so L squared is 4e-20 m².

So denominator =8 *9.109e-31 *4e-20 =8*9.109*4 *1e-51.

8*4=32. 32*9.109= approx 291.488.

So denominator=291.488e-51 → wait, wait, 8 *9.109e-31 =7.2872e-30. Then multiplied by 4e-20 →7.2872e-30 *4e-20 =2.91488e-49. So denominator is 2.91488e-49.

Wait, earlier I think I had 29.1488e-50, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me compute 8 *9.109e-31 * (2e-10)^2.

8 *9.109e-31 = 7.2872e-30.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20.

So 7.2872e-30 *4e-20 = 29.1488e-50, because 7e-30 *4e-20 = 28e-50.

Wait, that's correct.

So E_1 = (43.903e-68) / (29.1488e-50) ) = (43.903 /29.1488 ) * 1e-18.

43.903 /29.1488 is approximately 1.506.

So E_1 ≈1.506e-18 J. Correct.

So E_photon = 2.261e-17 J.

E_photon / E_1 = (2.261e-17) / (1.506e-18) = (2.261 /1.506 ) * (1e-17/1e-18) → 2.261/1.506 is about 1.501, multiplied by 10 →15.01.

So n² -1 =15.01 →n²=16.01 →n≈4. So initial state is n=4.

Looking at the options, D is 4. So the answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the transition of an electron in a one-dimensional box of length \( L = 2.00 \, \text{Å} = 2.00 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). The electron transitions from an excited state (\( n \)) to the ground state (\( n = 1 \)), emitting a photon of wavelength \( \lambda = 8.79 \, \text{nm} = 8.79 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \). The goal is to determine the quantum number \( n \) of the initial state.

### Step 1: Energy of the photon
The energy of the emitted photon is given by:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]
where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) is Planck's constant, \( c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda = 8.79 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \) is the wavelength of the photon. Substituting:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.00 \times 10^8)}{8.79 \times 10^{-9}}
\]
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{8.79 \times 10^{-9}} = 2.261 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 2: Energy levels in a one-dimensional box
The energy levels of an electron in a one-dimensional box are quantized and given by:
\[
E_n = \frac{n^2 h^2}{8 m_e L^2}
\]
where \( n \) is the quantum number, \( m_e = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the electron, and \( L = 2.00 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \) is the length of the box.

For the ground state (\( n = 1 \)):
\[
E_1 = \frac{h^2}{8 m_e L^2}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
E_1 = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 (9.109 \times 10^{-31}) (2.00 \times 10^{-10})^2}
\]
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2 = 4.3903 \times 10^{-67} \, \text{J}^2 \cdot \text{s}^2
\]
Next, calculate the denominator:
\[
8 (9.109 \times 10^{-31}) (2.00 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 8 (9.109 \times 10^{-31}) (4.00 \times 10^{-20}) = 2.91488 \times 10^{-49} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2
\]
Thus:
\[
E_1 = \frac{4.3903 \times 10^{-67}}{2.91488 \times 10^{-49}} = 1.506 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 3: Energy difference and quantum number
The energy difference between the initial state (\( n \)) and the ground state (\( n = 1 \)) is equal to the energy of the emitted photon:
\[
E_n - E_1 = E_{\text{photon}}
\]
Substituting \( E_n = n^2 E_1 \) (since \( E_n \propto n^2 \)):
\[
n^2 E_1 - E_1 = E_{\text{photon}}
\]
\[
E_1 (n^2 - 1) = E_{\text{photon}}
\]
Divide through by \( E_1 \):
\[
n^2 - 1 = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{E_1}
\]
Substitute \( E_{\text{photon}} = 2.261 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{J} \) and \( E_1 = 1.506 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \):
\[
n^2 - 1 = \frac{2.261 \times 10^{-17}}{1.506 \times 10^{-18}} = 15.01
\]
\[
n^2 = 16.01 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = \sqrt{16.01} \approx 4
\]

### Final Answer:
The quantum number of the initial state is \( n = 4 \).
