Question:

In 1888, a landowner owned a dairy farm. The landowner conveyed this real property to his son in1938. In 1953, the son conveyed the dairy farm to his friend. This deed was not recorded until after the son's death in 1957. In 1956, the son mortgaged the dairy farm to the bank. The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 1956, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to an investor in 1936 and recorded in 1936. In that instrument the son purported to grant the investor a mortgage on the dairy farm. In 1979, the friend conveyed the dairy farm to a farmer. This deed was duly recorded, but did not mention any mortgage. In 2008, a buyer entered into an agreement with the farmer, whereby the farmer would convey the dairy farm in fee simple to the buyer for the sum of $75,000. The closing date was set for January 15, 2009. All of the deeds mentioned in the aforementioned transactions are general warranty deeds. In addition, this jurisdiction has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. On January 15, 2009, the sale of the dairy farm is finalized and the buyer paid the farmer $75,000. The fanner executed a general warranty deed. The deed contains the following covenants of title:(1) Covenant for seisin. (2) Covenant of the right to convey. (3) Covenant against encumbrances. After the buyer takes possession of the dairy farm, he learns of the son investor 1936 mortgage, which was not satisfied, and seeks monetary damages for breach of the covenant against encumbrances. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the farmer, unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land thereby conveyed.
B: the buyer, if the farmer knew about the mortgage to the investor but did not disclose it.
C: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances protects against future claims on the property.
D: the buyer, because the covenant of the right to convey was breached.
E: the farmer, because the son's mortgage to the investor was not mentioned in the deed.
F: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.
G: the farmer, if the mortgage to the investor was satisfied before the sale to the buyer.
H: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.
I: the farmer, because the buyer did not perform a thorough title search before purchasing the property.
J: the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with deeds, covenants, and mortgages. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to break it down step by step.

Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand the scenario.

So, the setup is about a dairy farm that's been passed through several owners over the years. The key events are:

1. 1888: Landowner owns the farm.
2. 1938: Landowner conveys it to his son.
3. 1953: Son conveys it to his friend, but the deed isn't recorded until after the son's death in 1957.
4. 1956: Son mortgages the farm to a bank. The mortgage is recorded in 1956 and mentions it's subordinate to a 1936 mortgage to an investor, which was recorded in 1936.
5. 1979: Friend conveys to a farmer. The deed is recorded but doesn't mention any mortgage.
6. 2008: Farmer agrees to sell to a buyer for $75k, closing on Jan 15, 2009. The deed includes covenants of title: seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances.
7. After the sale, the buyer discovers the 1936 mortgage from son to investor, which wasn't satisfied. Buyer sues for breach of the covenant against encumbrances.

The question is about who would win the judgment. The options are A through J.

I need to figure out which option is correct based on the covenants and the timing of events.

First, I should recall what the covenant against encumbrances entails. From what I remember, the covenant against encumbrances is a promise by the seller that there are no outstanding liens, mortgages, or other encumbrances on the property except as noted in the deed. If such an encumbrance exists, the seller is in breach.

But wait, when does this covenant apply? I think it's a present covenant, meaning it's breached if there's an encumbrance at the time of the conveyance. So if the buyer later discovers an encumbrance that existed when they took the deed, they can sue.

In this case, the 1936 mortgage from the son to the investor was recorded in 1936. The son conveyed the property to the friend in 1953, but the deed wasn't recorded until 1957. Then, the son mortgages it again in 1956 to the bank, with the mortgage being subordinate to the 1936 one.

So, the chain of title is a bit complicated. Let me map it out:

- Landowner (1888) → son (1938)
- Son → friend (1953, recorded 1957)
- Son → bank (1956, recorded 1956)
- Friend → farmer (1979)
- Farmer → buyer (2009)

Wait, but the son conveyed to the friend in 1953, but didn't record until 1957. So prior to 1957, the friend's ownership wasn't recorded. The son then mortgages to the bank in 1956, which is recorded. So the bank's mortgage would be after the friend's conveyance but before the friend's deed is recorded.

In a notice jurisdiction, recording matters for whether subsequent purchasers have notice. So, if the friend's deed was recorded in 1957, then anyone who dealt with the property after that would be on notice of the friend's ownership. But the bank's mortgage in 1956, before the friend's deed was recorded, would be a problem because the bank might have taken without notice of the friend's prior conveyance.

Wait, but in 1956, the son mortgages the property to the bank. At that time, had the son already conveyed the property to the friend in 1953? Yes, but the friend's deed wasn't recorded until 1957. So in 1956, when the son mortgages to the bank, the bank would check the records. At that time, the records would show the landowner conveyed to son in 1938, and the son's mortgage to the investor in 1936. But the son's conveyance to the friend in 1953 wasn't recorded yet. So the bank, when taking the mortgage in 1956, would not have notice of the friend's ownership because it's not recorded. Therefore, the bank's mortgage would be a lien against the property, even though the son had already sold it to the friend.

But wait, in a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser who records first can take priority. Or is it the first in time? Wait, no, in a notice statute, a later purchaser who takes without notice of a prior unrecorded conveyance can take priority.

So in 1953, the son conveys to friend, but doesn't record until 1957. Then, in 1956, the son (apparently as the still-record owner) mortgages to the bank, which records in 1956.

Under the recording statute (notice type), the bank, when taking the mortgage in 1956, would have no notice of the friend's deed because it wasn't recorded yet. So the bank's mortgage would be valid against the friend's interest, because the bank had no notice. So the bank's mortgage would attach to the property, meaning the friend's title is subject to the bank's mortgage.

Wait, but the friend had already acquired title in 1953, but didn't record until 1957. So when the bank took the mortgage in 1956, the friend's deed wasn't recorded, so the bank didn't have notice. Therefore, the bank's mortgage would take priority over the friend's interest, under the recording statute.

So the friend's title is subject to the bank's mortgage. But wait, the son's mortgage to the investor in 1936 was recorded, so that's a prior lien.

Now, moving forward, when the friend conveys to the farmer in 1979, the deed is duly recorded but doesn't mention any mortgage. The farmer's deed includes a covenant against encumbrances. Then the farmer conveys to the buyer in 2009, with a general warranty deed, including the same covenants.

The buyer discovers the 1936 mortgage, which wasn't satisfied, and sues for breach of the covenant against encumbrances.

So the issue is whether the farmer's covenant against encumbrances was breached because the 1936 mortgage still exists.

Wait, the covenant against encumbrances is made by the farmer to the buyer in 2009. So the question is whether, at the time the farmer conveyed to the buyer, there were any encumbrances on the property.

But wait, the 1936 mortgage: who held it? The son conveyed the property to the friend in 1953, and the friend to the farmer in 1979. So if the 1936 mortgage was on the son's interest, when the son conveyed to the friend, did the mortgage get extinguished? Or does it run with the land?

In title theory states, mortgages are considered liens on the property. So when the son conveyed the property to the friend in 1953, the 1936 mortgage would remain as an encumbrance on the property, because it's a lien that runs with the land.

Wait, but the son conveyed the property to the friend in 1953, but the 1936 mortgage was from the son to the investor. So the mortgage is on the son's interest. If the son sold the property to the friend, does the mortgage get transferred? Or does the friend take subject to the mortgage?

In title theory states, the mortgage is a lien on the property, so when the son conveyed to the friend, the friend takes the property subject to the mortgage. So the 1936 mortgage would still be an encumbrance on the property when the friend owns it, and thus when the friend conveys to the farmer, the farmer would take subject to that mortgage as well, unless it was satisfied.

But in the problem, the 1936 mortgage was not satisfied. So when the farmer sells to the buyer in 2009, the mortgage is still an encumbrance.

So the farmer's deed to the buyer includes a covenant against encumbrances. Therefore, the farmer is warranting that there are no encumbrances except as noted. Since the 1936 mortgage wasn't noted, and it's still outstanding, the buyer can sue for breach.

Wait, but when did the farmer acquire the property? From the friend in 1979. The friend's deed to the farmer was recorded but didn't mention the mortgage. So when the farmer took the property, he took it subject to any existing mortgages, unless the friend's warranty covered it. But in this case, each conveyance includes a general warranty deed, so each grantor is making covenants to their grantee.

So the friend would have given a warranty to the farmer, including the covenant against encumbrances. If the 1936 mortgage was still on the property when the friend conveyed to the farmer, then the friend would have breached the covenant against encumbrances. But the farmer is now warranting to the buyer, so the buyer can sue the farmer.

Wait, but when the farmer took the property in 1979, the 1936 mortgage was still on it. So the friend's warranty to the farmer would have been breached, but the farmer, as the subsequent owner, would then warranty to the buyer.

So the buyer can sue the farmer for breach of the covenant against encumbrances because the 1936 mortgage was an existing encumbrance when the farmer conveyed to the buyer.

Now, looking at the options:

Option H says: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.

That makes sense because the covenant is about the time of conveyance. So if the encumbrance existed when the farmer conveyed to the buyer, the farmer is in breach.

Option J says: the farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.

Wait, no, J seems to suggest that the farmer isn't liable because the covenant is only about the time of conveyance. But that's the opposite of what H says. Wait, J says the covenant may only be breached at the time of conveyance. But if the encumbrance exists at that time, then the covenant is breached. So H and J seem to be conflicting.

Wait, the covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant, meaning it's broken when the deed is delivered if an encumbrance exists at that time. So the breach occurs at the time of conveyance, not later. So if the 1936 mortgage was still on the property when the farmer conveyed to the buyer, then the covenant was breached at that time.

So H is correct because the breach occurred when the deed was delivered. The buyer can recover damages because the encumbrance existed at the time of conveyance.

Option F says: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests. That's correct as well, but perhaps H is more specific about the timing.

Looking at the other options:

Option J says that the covenant may only be breached at the time of conveyance. But in reality, the breach occurs then, so J's statement is correct in that the breach is assessed at that time. But if there was an encumbrance, then the farmer is liable. So J is trying to say that if the encumbrance arose after the conveyance, it's not a problem, but since it was present at the time, the farmer is liable.

Wait, the question is whether the covenant is breached when the deed is delivered. So in this case, the encumbrance existed when the farmer conveyed to the buyer, so the covenant was breached, making H correct.

Option F is also correct in its statement, but H adds the timing element, which is key here.

So among the options, H seems correct.

The question revolves around a property law dispute involving covenants of title, specifically the covenant against encumbrances. The key facts are as follows:

1. **Chain of Title**: The dairy farm was conveyed through several owners, starting from the landowner to the son (1938), then to the friend (1953, recorded in 1957), and finally to the farmer (1979). The buyer purchased the property from the farmer in 2009.
2. **Mortgages**: In 1936, the son mortgaged the property to an investor, which was recorded. In 1956, the son mortgaged the property to the bank, which was also recorded and subordinated to the 1936 mortgage. The 1936 mortgage was not satisfied.
3. **Covenant Against Encumbrances**: The farmer conveyed the property to the buyer in 2009 via a general warranty deed, which included a covenant against encumbrances. The buyer later discovered the unsatisfied 1936 mortgage and sued for breach of this covenant.

The covenant against encumbrances is a present covenant, meaning it is breached if an encumbrance exists at the time of conveyance. In this case, the 1936 mortgage was an outstanding lien on the property when the farmer conveyed it to the buyer in 2009. Therefore, the covenant was breached at the time of the conveyance, entitling the buyer to recover damages.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option H**: Correct. It accurately states that the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered because the 1936 mortgage existed at that time.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. While it correctly states that the covenant may only be breached at the time of conveyance, it does not address the fact that the breach occurred because the 1936 mortgage existed at that time.
- Other options either misstate the law or fail to address the key issue of the timing of the breach.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H: the buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.**

Answer: H
