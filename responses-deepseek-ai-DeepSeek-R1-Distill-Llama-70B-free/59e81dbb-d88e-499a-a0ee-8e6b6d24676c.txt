Question:

The Federal Reserve's most important control instrument is open-market operations. How is it that selling government bonds can reduce bank reserves?

Options:

A: The bank will lose an equivalent amount of reserve balances with the Federal Reserve
B: The bank's reserve balances will become negative as a result of the bond sale
C: The bank's reserve balances increase due to interest payments on bonds
D: The bank will lose reserve balances only if the bonds are sold to the public, not to the Federal Reserve
E: The bank's reserve requirement ratio will decrease
F: The bank will gain more reserve balances
G: The bank's reserve balances will decrease by half the amount of the bonds sold
H: The bank's reserve balances will double
I: The bank's lending capacity will increase without any change in reserve balances
J: The bank's reserve balances remain unchanged

Okay, so I have this question about the Federal Reserve and open-market operations. Hmm, I remember that open-market operations involve the Fed buying or selling government securities to influence the money supply. The question is about selling government bonds and how that reduces bank reserves.

Wait, when the Fed sells bonds, what happens? Let me think. So, banks buy these bonds from the Fed, right? When a bank buys a bond, it pays the Fed using its reserves. So the bank's reserve balance with the Fed decreases because they're spending money to buy the bonds. That makes sense because reserves are like the money banks keep at the Fed.

Looking at the options, option A says the bank loses an equivalent amount of reserve balances. That seems right because the money used to buy the bonds comes out of their reserves.

Option B says the reserve balances become negative. No, I don't think that's the case. Banks can't have negative reserves; they have to maintain certain reserve requirements. The Fed might charge a penalty or something if they go negative, but the selling of bonds just reduces their reserves, not necessarily making them negative unless they already had very low reserves.

Option C mentions interest payments increasing reserves. No, interest on bonds would be separate. The initial sale reduces reserves, not increases them.

Option D says the bank loses reserves only if sold to the public. Wait, no, the Fed sells to banks or the public. If they sell to the public, the public's bank would have their reserves reduced when they pay the Fed. So whether sold to banks directly or through the public, the effect is similar. So D might not be correct.

Option E talks about reserve requirements decreasing. No, that's a different tool, like changing the reserve ratio. Open-market operations don't directly change the ratio; they change the amount of reserves.

Options F, G, H, I, J seem incorrect based on what I know. F says gain reserves, which is opposite. G says decrease by half, not sure why it would be half. H is doubling, which doesn't make sense. I says lending capacity increases without change in reservesâ€”probably not, because lower reserves would mean less capacity. J says unchanged, which is wrong because selling bonds should reduce them.

So the correct answer should be A. When the Fed sells bonds, banks pay with their reserves, so their reserve balances decrease by the same amount.

When the Federal Reserve sells government bonds as part of open-market operations, banks purchase these bonds using their reserve balances held at the Federal Reserve. This transaction directly reduces the banks' reserve balances by the amount of the bonds sold. This is because the funds used to buy the bonds are drawn from the banks' reserves. Among the options provided:

- **Option A** correctly states that the bank loses an equivalent amount of reserve balances, which aligns with how open-market operations function.
- Other options either misrepresent the mechanism (e.g., B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J) or contradict the fundamental principle that selling bonds reduces bank reserves.

Thus, the correct answer is:

A
