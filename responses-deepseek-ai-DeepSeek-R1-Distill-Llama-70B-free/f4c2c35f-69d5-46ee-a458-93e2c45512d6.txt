Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question says: A nonprofit environmental group includes a free gift of address labels in a letter asking for contributions. Which social psychological principle is the nonprofit group trying to use to increase contributions?

The options are A through J, each representing different psychological concepts.

Hmm, I remember that when organizations send free gifts with donation requests, they're often using a particular psychological principle to encourage people to give. I think it's related to reciprocity. Oh wait, right, the principle is called the reciprocity norm. The idea is that when someone gives you something, you feel compelled to give something back in return. So by including the address labels, the nonprofit is hoping that people will feel obligated to contribute because they received something for free.

Now, looking at the options. Option A is "compliance strategy." Compliance strategies are techniques to get people to agree to requests. The reciprocity principle is a type of compliance strategy. So option A might be the right answer.

Let me think about the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option B is confirmation bias, which is when people favor information that confirms their existing beliefs. That doesn't fit here. Option C is social loafing, where people exert less effort in a group. Not relevant. Option D, self-fulfilling prophecy, is when expectations influence outcomes. Doesn't seem to apply.

Option E is groupthink, which is about groups making irrational decisions. Not this. Option F, stable attribution, refers to attributing behavior to stable, unchanging factors. Not related. Option G is cognitive dissonance, which is about discomfort due to conflicting ideas. Maybe, but I don't think that's what's happening here. People might feel they should reciprocate, not necessarily reduce dissonance.

Option H, halo effect, is when a positive impression of a person influences judgments about their other qualities. Not quite fitting. Option I, bystander effect, is about people not helping when others are present. Doesn't apply. Option J, fundamental attribution error, is when we overstate the role of personality and understate situations. Not relevant here.

So the best fit is option A, compliance strategy, because the nonprofit is using the reciprocity principle to get people to comply with their request for contributions.

The nonprofit group is using the principle of reciprocity, a compliance strategy, by including free gifts to encourage contributions. This tactic leverages the psychological norm where people feel obligated to reciprocate after receiving something. Among the options provided, "compliance strategy" (Option A) best fits this scenario. The other options do not align with the described behavior or psychological principle.

Answer: A
