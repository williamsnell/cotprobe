Okay, so I need to figure out the selling price of a coat at Joe's Department Store. The problem says they want a 20% margin on the selling price, and the cost is $40. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about margins, so I'll have to think this through carefully.

First, I remember that margins can be a bit tricky because they can be based on cost or selling price. I think the key here is that the margin is on the selling price, not the cost. So, the margin is 20% of the selling price, not 20% of the cost. That's important because it changes how I calculate the selling price.

Let me break it down. The selling price (let's call it SP) is what the store sells the coat for. The cost price (CP) is what they paid for it, which is $40. The margin is the profit they make on each sale, which is 20% of SP.

So, the formula I think I should use is:

Profit = Margin = 20% of SP

And the selling price is the cost plus the profit. So,

SP = CP + Profit

Putting it together:

SP = CP + (20% of SP)

Wait, but that makes SP appear on both sides of the equation. Maybe I should rearrange this. Let me write it mathematically.

Let me denote SP as S. So,

S = 40 + 0.20 * S

Hmm, I can solve for S here. Let me subtract 0.20 S from both sides.

S - 0.20 S = 40

That simplifies to 0.80 S = 40

So, to find S, I divide both sides by 0.80.

S = 40 / 0.80

Let me calculate that. 40 divided by 0.8. Well, 0.8 is the same as 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is the same as multiplying by 5/4. So 40 * (5/4) = 50. So S is $50.

Wait, but I should double-check because sometimes I get confused between margin on cost and margin on selling price. Let me confirm. If the margin is on selling price, then the calculation is as above. If it were on cost, the profit would be 20% of $40, which is $8, making SP $48. But the question states it's a margin on the selling price, so the correct approach is the first one.

Looking at the options, option H is $50. So that should be the correct answer.

To determine the selling price (SP) of the coat with a 20% margin on the selling price and a cost price (CP) of $40, we use the following approach:

1. **Understand the margin**: The margin is 20% of the selling price, not the cost price.
2. **Set up the equation**:  
   \[
   \text{SP} = \text{CP} + \text{Profit}
   \]  
   where \(\text{Profit} = 20\% \times \text{SP}\). Substituting,  
   \[
   \text{SP} = 40 + 0.20 \times \text{SP}.
   \]
3. **Solve for SP**:  
   Rearranging the equation:  
   \[
   \text{SP} - 0.20 \times \text{SP} = 40 \implies 0.80 \times \text{SP} = 40.
   \]  
   Dividing both sides by 0.80:  
   \[
   \text{SP} = \frac{40}{0.80} = 50.
   \]
4. **Verify**: The selling price is $50, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
