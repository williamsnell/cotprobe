Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a telescope made from two spectacle lenses. I'm a bit rusty on optics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see...

The problem has two parts, a) and b). Part a) asks for the angular magnification, and part b) is about the image height of a building. Let me tackle them one by one.

Starting with part a). I remember that telescopes use two lenses: an objective and an eyepiece. The angular magnification (M) is given by the formula M = - (f_objective / f_eyepiece), where f is the focal length. Oh wait, wait, I think the formula might actually be M = (f_objective / f_eyepiece). Or was there a negative sign involved? Hmm. Oh wait, right, the angular magnification for a telescope is the ratio of the focal lengths of the objective to the eyepiece. But wait, I'm a bit confused about which one is which. The problem says the telescope is constructed of two spectacle lenses with focal lengths 100 cm and 20 cm. Wait, spectacle lenses—so they're probably convex lenses, which are converging. So the objective is the one with the longer focal length because it's used to collect light and form an image. So, the 100 cm lens is the objective, and the 20 cm is the eyepiece.

So plugging into the formula, M would be (100 cm)/(20 cm) = 5. But wait, angular magnification is a positive value? Or negative? Oh right, the magnification formula for telescopes gives the angular size, and the negative sign would indicate whether the image is upright or inverted. But since the question just asks for the magnification, I think we take the absolute value. So M is 5.

Wait, but another thought: I've heard that the magnification is sometimes given as the negative of that ratio. So like M = -(f_objective / f_eyepiece). But in telescopes, the image is inverted, but the magnification is still the magnitude. So I think for part a), the angular magnification is 5.

Now moving on to part b). The question is about the height of the image formed by the objective of a building 200 ft high and one mile distant. Hmm. So the objective lens forms an image of the object, which is the building. So we're probably looking at the size of this image.

Wait, the building's height is 200 feet, and it's one mile away. I need to convert these units into something consistent. Let's think in inches because the answer options are in inches. But wait, maybe I should first convert everything into meters or centimeters because focal lengths are in centimeters. Alternatively, perhaps I can use feet and inches consistently.

Wait, let me approach this step by step. The building is 200 ft high, and it's one mile away. So I think I can model this with the thin lens equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where do is the object distance, di is the image distance, and f is the focal length of the objective lens.

Wait, but what's the object distance here? The building is one mile away. Let me convert that into centimeters since the focal length is in cm. Let's see: 1 mile is 5280 feet. So 5280 feet * 30.48 cm/ft = let's calculate that. 5280 * 30.48. Well, 5000 ft is 152400 cm, and 280 ft is 8468.4 cm, so total is 160,868.4 cm. So do = 160,868.4 cm.

The focal length of the objective is 100 cm. So using the lens formula: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

Wait, but wait, the image formed by the objective is the real image that the eyepiece will then focus. So in a telescope, the objective forms a real image just inside the eyepiece. So the image distance di would be for that. So plugging in the numbers:

1/100 = 1/160868.4 + 1/di.

Let me compute 1/160868.4. That's approximately 6.21e-6 1/cm. So 1/di = 1/100 - 6.21e-6 = 0.01 - 0.00000621 ≈ 0.00999379. So di ≈ 1 / 0.00999379 ≈ 100.0621 cm. So the image is formed just a bit beyond the focal length? That makes sense because the object is very far away.

Wait, but wait, for a very distant object, the image distance approaches the focal length. So di ≈ f, which is 100 cm, as expected.

Now, the next part is to find the height of the image. We can use the magnification formula for lenses, which is (image height)/(object height) = - di/do. So the magnification m = - (di/do).

Wait, di is about 100 cm, do is about 160,868 cm. So m ≈ - (100 / 160868) ≈ -0.000621.

The object height is 200 ft. Wait, I need to convert this into the same units as di and do. Let me convert 200 ft to cm. 1 ft is 30.48 cm, so 200 ft is 200 * 30.48 = 6096 cm.

So the image height h' is m * h, where h is the object height. So h' = m * h = (-0.000621) * 6096 cm.

Let me compute 0.000621 * 6096. 6096 * 0.0006 is approximately 3.6576, and 6096 * 0.000021 is about 0.1280. So total is roughly 3.6576 + 0.1280 = 3.7856 cm. So about 3.79 cm. But wait, the options are in inches. So 3.79 cm is how many inches? Since 1 inch is 2.54 cm, so 3.79 / 2.54 ≈ 1.49 inches. So approximately 1.5 inches.

Wait, but wait a second. The magnification is negative, which would indicate the image is inverted. But the question is about the height, so the absolute value is what matters.

Hmm, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the lens magnification formula. The formula is hi/ho = - di/do. So, hi = - (di/do) * ho.

So plugging the numbers: di is approximately 100 cm, do is 160,868 cm, ho is 6096 cm.

So hi = -(100 / 160868) * 6096 ≈ - (0.000621) * 6096 ≈ -3.785 cm. So the height is 3.785 cm, which is approximately 1.49 inches, which rounds to about 1.5 inches.

Wait, but wait, that would make the image height about 1.5 inches. But let me check the calculations again because sometimes I might have messed up the exponents.

Wait, 100 / 160868.4 is 100 / 160868.4 = approximately 0.000621. So 0.000621 * 6096 = ?

Let me compute 6096 * 0.0006 = 3.6576, and 6096 * 0.000021 = 0.128. So sum is about 3.7856 cm, yes. So 3.7856 cm is equal to how many inches?

3.7856 cm divided by 2.54 cm/inch ≈ 1.49 inches.

So the image height is approximately 1.5 inches.

Wait, but the options list part a) as angular magnification 5 and part b) as 1.5 inches. So looking at the options, option B says angular magnification 5, image height 1.5 inches. Option A says image height 2 inches.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 200 ft is 200 * 0.3048 meters = 60.96 meters. Wait, but no, perhaps I should compute it all in cm. 200 ft = 200 * 30.48 cm = 6096 cm, as I did before.

Do is 1 mile, which is 5280 ft. 5280 * 30.48 = 5280 * 30.48. Let me compute that: 5000 *30.48=152400 cm, 280 *30.48= 8,534.4 cm. So total 152400 + 8534.4 = 160,934.4 cm.

So do = 160,934.4 cm.

So 1/do = 1/160934.4 ≈ 6.21e-6.

So 1/di = 1/f - 1/do = (1/100) - (6.21e-6) ≈ 0.00999938.

So di ≈ 100.006 cm.

So di/do = 100.006 / 160,934.4 ≈ 0.0006212.

So hi = - (di/do) * ho = -0.0006212 * 6096 cm.

0.0006212 * 6096 = let's compute 6096 * 6212e-7.

Wait, 6096 * 6.212e-4 = ?

6.212e-4 is 0.0006212.

Compute 6096 * 0.0006212:

6096 * 0.0006 = 3.6576
6096 * 0.0000212 = approx 0.1292.

So total about 3.7868 cm, which is 3.787 cm.

Convert to inches: 3.787 /2.54 ≈ 1.49 inches, so 1.5 inches.

So part b's answer is 1.5 inches.

So part a) is 5, part b) 1.5 inches. Which matches option B.

Wait, but let me make sure there's no mistake. Another approach: perhaps using small angle approximations.

Alternatively, for very distant objects, the image distance is approximately f. So di ≈ 100 cm. Then the magnification m = - (f / do) since for di ≈ f, m = - (f/do). Wait, but wait, the formula is m = - (di/do). If di is approximately 100 cm, then m ≈ -100 / 160,934 ≈ -0.000621.

So m = -0.000621, and object height is 6096 cm, so image height is 6096 * 0.000621 ≈ 3.787 cm, as before.

So same result. So the image height is about 1.5 inches. So part b) is 1.5 inches.

Now looking at the options:

Option B: Angular magnification 5, image 1.5 inches.

Option A: 5 and 2 inches.

Hmm, but in my calculation, it's 1.5 inches, so option B.

Wait, but I'm a little confused because sometimes the formula for magnification in telescopes is given as M = (f_obj)/(f_eyepiece), which would be 100/20=5, so that's correct.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be option B, which has angular magnification 5 and image height 1.5 inches.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the two parts as follows:

### Part (a): Angular Magnification
The telescope is constructed using two lenses: an objective with a focal length \( f_{\text{objective}} = 100 \, \text{cm} \) and an eyepiece with a focal length \( f_{\text{eyepiece}} = 20 \, \text{cm} \). The angular magnification \( M \) of a telescope is given by:

\[
M = \frac{f_{\text{objective}}}{f_{\text{eyepiece}}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
M = \frac{100}{20} = 5
\]

Thus, the angular magnification is 5.

---

### Part (b): Image Height
The objective lens forms a real image of a building that is \( 200 \, \text{ft} \) high and located \( 1 \, \text{mile} \) away. To find the height of this image, we use the lens equation and magnification formula.

1. **Convert units**:  
   - \( 1 \, \text{mile} = 5280 \, \text{ft} = 5280 \times 30.48 \, \text{cm} = 160,934.4 \, \text{cm} \) (object distance \( d_o \)).  
   - \( 200 \, \text{ft} = 200 \times 30.48 \, \text{cm} = 6096 \, \text{cm} \) (object height \( h_o \)).

2. **Lens equation**:  
   The focal length of the objective is \( f = 100 \, \text{cm} \). Using the lens formula:

   \[
   \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
   \]

   Substituting \( f = 100 \, \text{cm} \) and \( d_o = 160,934.4 \, \text{cm} \):

   \[
   \frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{100} - \frac{1}{160,934.4}
   \]

   \[
   \frac{1}{d_i} \approx 0.00999938 \quad \Rightarrow \quad d_i \approx 100.006 \, \text{cm}
   \]

   The image distance \( d_i \) is approximately equal to the focal length \( f \), as expected for a distant object.

3. **Magnification and image height**:  
   The magnification \( m \) is given by:

   \[
   m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}
   \]

   Substituting \( d_i \approx 100 \, \text{cm} \) and \( d_o = 160,934.4 \, \text{cm} \):

   \[
   m \approx -\frac{100}{160,934.4} \approx -0.000621
   \]

   The image height \( h_i \) is:

   \[
   h_i = m \cdot h_o = -0.000621 \cdot 6096 \, \text{cm} \approx -3.787 \, \text{cm}
   \]

   Converting to inches (\( 1 \, \text{inch} = 2.54 \, \text{cm} \)):

   \[
   h_i \approx \frac{3.787}{2.54} \approx 1.49 \, \text{inches}
   \]

   Thus, the image height is approximately \( 1.5 \, \text{inches} \).

---

### Final Answer
The angular magnification is \( 5 \), and the image height is \( 1.5 \, \text{inches} \). These values correspond to **Option B**.
