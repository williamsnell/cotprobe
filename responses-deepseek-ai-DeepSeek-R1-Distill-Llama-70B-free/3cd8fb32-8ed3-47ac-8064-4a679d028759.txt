Okay, so I've got this question about Bentham's views on morality and theology. Hmm, I remember that Bentham was a utilitarian philosopher. Let me think about what I know about his theories.

Bentham is known for the principle of utility, which says that actions are right if they promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number. So, morality is based on consequences, specifically the overall happiness.

The question is about the relationship between morality and theology. So, how did Bentham see God's will in relation to what's right or wrong?

I think Bentham was critical of traditional moral theories that relied on theology. He focused more on human experience and reason rather than divine command. But wait, how does that translate into the options given?

Looking at the options, option E says we must first know if something is right before knowing if it conforms to God's will. Option F is the opposite: we must know God's will first to know what's right.

Bentham's utilitarian approach suggests that rightness is determined by utility, not by divine will. So, if something is right because it's useful, then we determine rightness first, and then see if it aligns with God's will. Wait, but does he say anything about whether knowing God's will is necessary?

Alternatively, I remember that Bentham might have argued that God's will is not the basis for morality. So, he might say that we can determine right and wrong independently of theology.

Looking at the options again, option E says we must first know right before knowing God's will. That makes sense because if rightness is based on utility, then God's will would be secondary. So, if an action is right, then it conforms to God's will, but we don't need to know God's will first to determine rightness.

Option F suggests the opposite, which would be more in line with a divine command theory, where what's right is determined by God's will. So that's probably not Bentham's view.

Wait, but another angle: Bentham might have said that to know if something is right, we don't need to refer to God's will. So, knowing rightness comes before knowing God's will.

So, the correct answer would be E: we must first know whether something is right before we can know whether it conforms to God’s will.

Alternatively, could it be option I: Morality exists independently of God's will? That's a broader statement that fits, but the question is about the relationship as per Bentham's claim.

The question is about their relationship, so it's more about the order of knowing. So, the statement would be about whether rightness is known before or after knowing God's will.

So, I think the answer is E.

Bentham, a utilitarian philosopher, argued that morality is determined by the principle of utility, which focuses on the consequences of actions in terms of happiness. He emphasized that rightness is based on human experience and reason rather than divine command. This suggests that morality can be determined independently of theology. 

Analyzing the options, option E states that we must first know whether something is right before knowing if it conforms to God's will. This aligns with Bentham's view that rightness is determined by utility, and only afterward can it be considered in relation to God's will. Option F, which suggests the opposite, would imply a divine command theory, which is inconsistent with Bentham's utilitarian approach. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: we must first know whether something is right before we can know whether it conforms to God’s will.

Answer: E
