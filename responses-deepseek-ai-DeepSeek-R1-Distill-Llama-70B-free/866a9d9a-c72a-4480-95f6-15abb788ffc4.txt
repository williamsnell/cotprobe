Okay, so I've got this problem here about Jacob giving a note to the Franklin Mint, and I need to figure out the proceeds when it's discounted at a bank. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the note is for $1250, and it's a 90-day note. He gave it on October 10. Then, it was discounted on November 15. So, the time between October 10 and November 15 is... let me count the days. October has 31 days, so from October 10 to October 31 is 21 days. Then, from November 1 to November 15 is another 15 days. So total of 21 + 15 = 36 days. So the note has been held for 36 days, and there are 90 days in total. That means the remaining time until maturity is 90 - 36 = 54 days.

Wait, but when calculating discount interest, do I use the remaining days or the days it's been held? I think it's the remaining time because the bank is discounting it before it's due. So the discount period is 54 days.

The discount rate is 6 and a half percent, which is 6.5%. I remember that the formula for the discount is based on the face value, the rate, and the time. The formula I think is:

Discount = (Face Value × Rate × Time) / 360

But wait, sometimes it's 365 days, depending on the method. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, I think in commercial banking, it's usually 360 days for calculations. So I'll go with 360.

So plugging in the numbers: Face Value is $1250, Rate is 6.5% or 0.065, Time is 54 days. So the discount would be:

Discount = 1250 × 0.065 × (54/360)

Let me compute that. Let's calculate 54/360 first. 54 divided by 360 is 0.15. So then, 1250 × 0.065 is... 1250 times 0.06 is 75, and 1250 × 0.005 is 6.25. So 75 + 6.25 is 81.25. Then, 81.25 × 0.15 is... let's see. 80 × 0.15 is 12, and 1.25 × 0.15 is 0.1875. So total is 12.1875. So the discount is $12.1875.

Wait, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 1250 * 0.065 first, then multiply by (54/360).

1250 × 0.065 = 81.25. Then, 81.25 × (54/360) = 81.25 × 0.15. Which is indeed 12.1875. So the discount is $12.1875.

So the proceeds would be the face value minus the discount. So $1250 - $12.1875 equals $1237.8125. Hmm, looking at the options, option G is $1,237.81. That seems to match.

Wait, but let me double-check the time factor. The note was dated October 10, discounted on November 15. So from October 10 to November 15 is exactly 36 days. Because October has 31 days, so 31 - 10 = 21 days left in October, then 15 days in November. So 21 + 15 = 36 days. So the remaining days are 90 -36 =54 days. So yes, time is 54 days.

Alternatively, some might calculate using 365 days. Let me see what happens then. Using 365 days:

Discount = 1250 * 0.065 * (54/365). Let's compute that.

54/365 is approximately 0.1479. So 1250 × 0.065 is 81.25. 81.25 × 0.1479 ≈ 12.03. So the discount is about $12.03, and proceeds would be 1250 -12.03 = 1237.97. Hmm, which is about $1237.97. None of the options exactly match that. The closest is option G, which is $1,237.81.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether it's using 360 or 365 days. The formula for bank discount often uses 360 days, I think. So the correct calculation is 54/360, which gives us $12.1875 discount, leading to $1237.8125, which would round to $1237.81, matching option G.

So the answer should be G.

To determine the proceeds from discounting the note, we start by calculating the discount. The note has a face value of $1,250, a term of 90 days, and a discount rate of 6.5%. The note was discounted on November 15, which is 36 days after the issue date (October 10). Therefore, the remaining time to maturity is:

\[
90 - 36 = 54 \, \text{days}.
\]

The formula for calculating the discount is:

\[
\text{Discount} = \frac{\text{Face Value} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}}{360}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Discount} = \frac{1,250 \times 0.065 \times 54}{360}.
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{54}{360} = 0.15 \). Then:

\[
\text{Discount} = 1,250 \times 0.065 \times 0.15 = 12.1875.
\]

The proceeds are the face value minus the discount:

\[
\text{Proceeds} = 1,250 - 12.1875 = 1,237.8125.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the proceeds are $1,237.81. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**G: $1,237.81.**
