Okay, so I have this question about the major noneconomic argument for pure capitalism. Hmm, I remember that in economics, capitalism is often discussed in terms of efficiency and economic growth, but the question is about noneconomic arguments. So I need to think about what other benefits capitalism might have beyond just the economy.

The options given are A through J. The question says the major economic argument is maximum efficiency, so the noneconomic one must be something else. Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Capitalism results in single authority. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Capitalism is more about decentralization, not a single authority. So probably not A.

Option B: Ensures job security. I don't think that's a strong point. In fact, capitalism can lead to job insecurity because of competition and the market's ups and downs. So B doesn't seem correct.

Option C: Fosters cultural diversity. Hmm, I'm not too sure. Capitalism might lead to globalization, which can sometimes reduce cultural diversity as big companies dominate. Maybe not the best fit.

Option D: Promotes personal freedom. Oh, this rings a bell. I've heard that capitalism is associated with individual freedoms because people can own property, start businesses, and make choices in a free market. That sounds like a noneconomic argument, more about personal liberty.

Option E: Encourages moral responsibility. I'm not certain. Some might argue that capitalism can lead to greed, so maybe this isn't the main point.

Option F: Provides a platform for technological innovation. That's more of an economic argument because innovation drives economic growth. So F is probably not the answer they're looking for here.

Option G: Leads to wealth equality. No, that's the opposite. Capitalism often leads to wealth inequality, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Improves international relations. I'm not sure. It can go either way. Sometimes trade improves relations, but conflicts can also arise. Not sure if this is the major noneconomic argument.

Option I: Enhances individual creativity. That could be a point. Capitalism allows for entrepreneurship and innovation, which does involve creativity. But is this the major noneconomic argument? I'm not certain. I think personal freedom is a bigger one.

Option J: Supports sustainable environmental practices. I don't think so. Capitalism is often criticized for prioritizing profits over the environment, leading to pollution and resource depletion. So J is probably wrong.

Putting it all together, the major noneconomic argument for capitalism is likely about personal freedom. People have more autonomy to make choices, start businesses, and live as they wish without excessive government control. So the answer should be D.

The major noneconomic argument for pure capitalism is that it promotes personal freedom. This allows individuals to own property, start businesses, and make choices in a free market, emphasizing individual liberty beyond economic efficiency.

Answer: D
