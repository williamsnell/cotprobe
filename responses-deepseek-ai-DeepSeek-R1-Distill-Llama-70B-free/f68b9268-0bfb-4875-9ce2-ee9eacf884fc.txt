Question:

When it comes to STATISTICAL DECISION-MAKING, rejecting a false null is the goal of most researches. From your knowledge about TYPE I ERROR, which statement out of the following ones is about it?

Options:

A: null hypothesis is accepted, but it is false
B: the level of significance is set by the researcher at .01 or .05
C: graphically→ white is retention area and black is rejected area
D: probability of making a Beta Level error
E: null hypothesis is rejected, but it is true
F: null hypothesis is accepted, and it is true
G: null hypothesis is not rejected, but it is false
H: the level of significance is set by the researcher at .10 or .20
I: graphically→ black is retention area and white is rejected area

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about statistical decision-making, specifically regarding Type I errors. Hmm, let me think through this. 

The question is asking which statement correctly describes a Type I error. I remember that in statistics, there are two main types of errors: Type I and Type II. Type I is often called a false positive, while Type II is a false negative. 

Wait, Type I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis, but it's actually true. Right, so the null is true, but we said it wasn't. So looking at the options, I need to find the one that matches this.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A: Null hypothesis is accepted, but it's false. That sounds like the opposite of Type I. If we accept a false null, that's not a Type I error. I think that's actually related to Type II errors, where we fail to reject a false null. So A is probably not correct.

Option B: Level of significance set by researcher at .01 or .05. Oh, right, that's about alpha, the significance level. It's the probability of making a Type I error. But the question is about what the Type I error is, not about setting alpha. So B isn't the correct statement about Type I itself.

Option C: Graphically, white is retention, black is rejected. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think in some graphs, like the sampling distribution, the rejection region is usually shaded, maybe black, and the rest is white. So if white is retention (fail to reject) and black is reject, then this might be correct in terms of graphing, but does it describe Type I error? Hmm, not directly. It's more about the setup than the error itself. So probably not the answer.

Option D: Probability of making a Beta Level error. Wait, Beta is the probability of Type II error. So D is talking about Type II errors, not Type I. So D isn't correct.

Option E: Null hypothesis is rejected, but it's true. Oh yeah, that's exactly Type I error. Rejecting a true null hypothesis. So E looks correct.

Option F: Null is accepted, and it's true. That's a correct decision, not an error. So F is correct but not an error.

Option G: Null is not rejected, but it's false. That's Type II error, failing to reject a false null. So G is Type II, not I.

Option H: Significance level set at .10 or .20. Similar to B, it's about alpha, not the error description. So H isn't the answer.

Option I: Graphically, black is retention, white rejected. Wait, I thought retention was white, so this would be the opposite. But regardless, it's about graphical representation, not the error definition. So I isn't the correct choice.

So putting it all together, the correct statement about Type I error is E: Null hypothesis is rejected, but it's true.

When analyzing the question regarding Type I errors, it's important to remember that a Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected despite being true. This is often referred to as a "false positive." 

- **Option A** describes a scenario where the null hypothesis is accepted but is false, which pertains to Type II errors, not Type I.  
- **Option B** discusses the significance level (alpha), which is related to the probability of a Type I error but does not define it.  
- **Option C** refers to graphical representations of rejection and retention areas, which are not directly describing the error itself.  
- **Option D** mentions Beta levels, which are associated with Type II errors, not Type I.  
- **Option E** correctly describes a Type I error: rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.  
- **Option F** describes a correct decision, not an error.  
- **Option G** pertains to Type II errors, where a false null hypothesis is not rejected.  
- **Option H** again refers to significance levels, not the error itself.  
- **Option I** discusses graphical representations, which are unrelated to the definition of Type I errors.  

The correct answer is **E**, as it accurately describes a Type I error.  

Answer: E
