Okay, so I've got this question about affective disorders as described in the DSM-III. I'm a bit rusty on my psychiatry, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about the DSM-III and affective disorders.

Affective disorders, also known as mood disorders, primarily involve disturbances in mood. The DSM-III was a significant revision in psychiatric diagnosis, published in 1980, and it introduced more structured criteria. I remember that in DSM-III, mood disorders were categorized based on certain features, including the type of mood disturbance and the duration of symptoms.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Affective disorders are always chronic and long lasting. Hmm, I don't think that's right. I remember that some can be episodic, like major depressive episodes which can be short-term but severe.

Option B: Categorized solely based on duration of symptoms, irrespective of mood. That doesn't sound correct. I think DSM-III considered both the type of mood (like depressed, manic) and the duration.

Option C: Only classified according to predominant mood. Maybe that's part of it, but I think there's more. Like, they also considered duration, so this might be incomplete.

Option D: Characterized by disturbance of mood with related symptoms, categorized into depressed, manic, or bipolar. Further divided into episodic, chronic, atypical. That rings a bell. I think DSM-III did have these categories. They had things like major depressive disorder, which could be episodic or chronic, and bipolar disorders which involve manic episodes. Atypical might refer to atypical depression, which has specific features.

Option E: Mood instability due to external factors. I don't think affective disorders are solely due to external factors. They can be due to a mix of biological and environmental factors, but the definition in DSM-III is more about the symptom presentation, not the cause.

Option F: Only extreme happiness or mania. No, that's not right. Affective disorders include both depression and mania, so this is too narrow.

Option G: Not recognized in DSM-III. No, that's incorrect. DSM-III definitely included affective/mood disorders.

Option H: Single episode of depression, no recurrence. I don't think so. DSM-III would have considered both single and recurrent episodes.

Option I: Only depressive episodes without mania. No, because bipolar disorders include mania, so this is wrong.

Option J: Classified based on cognitive impairments. No, affective disorders are primarily about mood, not cognition.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D. It correctly describes that affective disorders involve mood disturbances with related symptoms, categorizes them into types like depressed, manic, bipolar, and further divides them into episodic, chronic, etc., which aligns with what I remember about DSM-III.

The correct answer is:

**D: Affective disorders are characterized by a disturbance of mood accompanied by related symptoms, and can be categorized into depressed, manic, or bipolar. They are further divided into episodic, chronic, and atypical affective disorders in DSM III.**

This option accurately reflects the DSM-III classification of affective disorders, which considers both the type of mood disturbance and the duration of symptoms. Other options either oversimplify or misrepresent the criteria used in DSM-III.

**Answer: D**
