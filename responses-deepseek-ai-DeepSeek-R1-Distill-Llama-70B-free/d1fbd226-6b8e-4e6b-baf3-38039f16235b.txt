Okay, so I have this problem about barometers and different liquids. Hmm, I remember that a barometer measures atmospheric pressure by the height of a column of liquid it can support. The most common one uses mercury, right? But this question is about using gallium instead.

The question gives the density of liquid gallium as 6.09 g/cm³ at 35°C. I need to find the height of the gallium column when the pressure is 1 atmosphere. The options are given from A to J, each with different mm values.

Wait, I think the formula for pressure in a fluid is P = ρgh. Oh right, pressure equals density times gravity times height. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So I can rearrange this to solve for height. So h = P/(ρg).

But wait, I should make sure the units are consistent. Let me think about the units. The density is given in g/cm³, which is grams per cubic centimeter. I might need to convert that to kg/m³ because the standard units for density in the formula are kg/m³.

Density ρ = 6.09 g/cm³. To convert to kg/m³, I know that 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. So 6.09 g/cm³ is 6.09 * 1000 kg/m³, which is 6090 kg/m³.

Wait no, wait. Let me correct that. Because 1 g is 0.001 kg, and 1 cm³ is (0.01 m)^3 = 1e-6 m³. So 1 g/cm³ = (0.001 kg) / (1e-6 m³) ) = 1000 kg/m³. So yes, 6.09 g/cm³ is 6090 kg/m³.

Gravity g is 9.81 m/s², I think that's standard.

Pressure P is 1 atm. I need to convert that into Pascals. I remember that 1 atm is 101325 Pascals. So P = 101325 Pa.

Putting it all into the formula: h = P/(ρg) = 101325 / (6090 * 9.81).

Wait let me compute that denominator first. 6090 multiplied by 9.81. Let me calculate that.

6090 * 9.81. Let me see, 6090 * 10 is 60900, but subtract 6090 * 0.19, which is 6090 * 0.2 is 1218, minus 6090 *0.01 which is 60.9. So 1218 -60.9 = 1157.1. So 60900 - 1157.1 = 59742.9. So approximately 59742.9.

Wait wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. 6090 * 9.81.

Compute 6090 *9 = 54810. 6090 *0.81 = ?

6090 *0.8 = 4872, 6090 *0.01=60.9. So 4872 +60.9 = 4932.9. So total 54810 +4932.9 = 59742.9. Yeah, same as before.

So denominator is 59742.9. So h = 101325 / 59742.9 ≈ let's calculate that.

101325 divided by 59742.9. Let me approximate this. Let's see, 59742.9 *1.7 is approximately 101,506.93 because 59742.9 *1=59742.9, 59742.9 *0.7=41,820.03. Adding gives 59742.9+41820.03=101562.93. Oh wait, but our numerator is 101325, which is a bit less than 101562.93.

So 1.7 would give us about 101563, which is a bit higher than 101325. So the actual value is a bit less than 1.7. Let's compute 101325 / 59742.9.

Maybe it's easier to compute 101325 ÷ 59742.9.

Let me try 59742.9 × 1.695.

59742.9 × 1.6 = let me compute 59742.9 ×1.6. 59742.9 *1 =59742.9, 59742.9 *0.6=35825.74. Adding gives 95568.64.

1.695 is 1.6 +0.095. So 0.095 *59742.9 = let's compute 59742.9 *0.1=5974.29, but since it's 0.095, that's 5974.29 *0.95. 5974.29 *0.95: 5974.29 - (5974.29 *0.05)=5974.29 -298.7145=5675.5755.

So 59742.9 *1.695 = 95568.64 +5675.5755=101244.2155.

But our numerator is 101325, which is a bit higher than 101244.2155.

So 1.695 gives us 101244.2, and the difference is 101325 -101244.2 = 80.8.

So how much more than 1.695 do we need? Let's find x where 59742.9 *x =80.8.

x=80.8/59742.9 ≈ approximately 0.00135. So total h is approximately 1.695 +0.00135 ≈ 1.69635 meters.

Wait, no. Because 1.695 gave us 101244.2, which is 80.8 less than 101325. So the additional x is 80.8 /59742.9 ≈ 0.00135. So h is approximately 1.69635 meters.

But wait, that's in meters, right? Because the formula is in meters. So 1.69635 meters is 169.635 centimeters, which is 1696.35 mm.

Looking at the options, option A is 1697 mm Ga. So that's very close.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes rounding can cause issues. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, let me compute the denominator again. 6090 kg/m³ * 9.81 m/s². 6090 *9.81. Let me compute 6090 ×9.81.

Let me compute it step by step:

6090 × 9 = 54810

6090 × 0.8 = 4872

6090 × 0.01 =60.9

So 54810 +4872 =59682, plus 60.9 is 59742.9. Yes, that's correct.

So P=101325 Pa.

h = 101325 / (6090 *9.81) = 101325 / 59742.9 ≈ 1.69635 meters.

Convert to mm, that's 1696.35 mm, which is approximately 1697 mm. So option A.

Wait, but I recall that mercury's barometer is about 760 mm Hg at 1 atm. Since mercury has a higher density than gallium, gallium would have a higher column, which makes sense since 1697 mm is higher than 760 mm.

Wait, wait, wait a minute. Mercury's density is about 13.6 g/cm³. Gallium is 6.09, which is less than half. So if mercury gives 760 mm, gallium should give a higher column. Because with lower density, you need a taller column to reach the same pressure.

Yes, because pressure is ρgh. So if density is lower, to get the same P, h must be higher.

So 1697 mm is correct. So the answer should be A.

To determine the height of a gallium column in a barometer at 1 atm pressure, we use the formula for pressure in a fluid:

\[
P = \rho g h \quad \text{or rearranged as} \quad h = \frac{P}{\rho g}
\]

### Step 1: Identify the given values
- **Pressure (\(P\))**: \(1 \, \text{atm} = 101325 \, \text{Pa}\)
- **Density of gallium (\(\rho\))**: \(6.09 \, \text{g/cm}^3 = 6090 \, \text{kg/m}^3\) (converted by multiplying by \(1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 / \text{g/cm}^3\))
- **Acceleration due to gravity (\(g\))**: \(9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2\)

### Step 2: Calculate the denominator (\(\rho g\))
\[
\rho g = 6090 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \times 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 59742.9 \, \text{kg/(m}^2\text{s}^2\text{)}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \(h\)
\[
h = \frac{P}{\rho g} = \frac{101325}{59742.9} \approx 1.69635 \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 4: Convert height to millimeters
\[
h = 1.69635 \, \text{m} \times 1000 \, \text{mm/m} = 1696.35 \, \text{mm}
\]

### Step 5: Match the closest option
The calculated height of \(1696.35 \, \text{mm}\) is approximately \(1697 \, \text{mm}\), which corresponds to **option A**.

### Conclusion
The height of the gallium column in the barometer at 1 atm pressure is approximately **1697 mm Ga**.
