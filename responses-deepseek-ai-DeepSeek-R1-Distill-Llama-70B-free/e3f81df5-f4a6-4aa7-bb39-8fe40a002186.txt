Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the latent heat of vaporization for lithium at 2700°F. Hmm, I remember that latent heat is related to the vapor pressure and other thermodynamic properties. Let me think about the formula I should use here.

Wait, the Antoine equation comes to mind. It's used to relate vapor pressure to temperature. The given equation is ln p° = [(-3.29e4)/T] + 14.05, where p is in psi and T is in Rankine. Right, because Fahrenheit and Rankine are related by T_R = T_F + 459.67. So I'll need to convert 2700°F to Rankine.

Let me calculate that first. 2700 + 459.67 is about 3159.67 R.

Now, plugging this into the equation to find the vapor pressure ln p°. So ln p = (-3.29e4 / 3159.67) + 14.05. Let's compute each part. 3.29e4 divided by 3159.67 is approximately... let's see, 3.29e4 is 32900. 32900 / 3159.67 ≈ 10.416. So with the negative sign, it's -10.416. Adding 14.05 gives me 14.05 -10.416 = 3.634. So ln p = 3.634. Taking the natural exponent of that, e^3.634 is about 37.7 psi. Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations. Oh wait, 3.29e4 is 32900, right? Divided by 3159.67, yeah that's around 10.416. Subtracting from 14.05 gives 3.634. Exponentiating 3.634: e^3 is about 20.085, and e^0.634 is around 1.885. So 20.085 * 1.885 ≈ 37.85 psi. So p ≈ 37.85 psi.

Wait, but wait, the Antoine equation is usually in the form ln P = A - (B/(T + C)), but here C isn't present, so P is in psi. So that should be correct.

Next, I think I need to use the Clapeyron equation, which relates the latent heat of vaporization (h_lv) to the vapor pressure and temperature. The Clapeyron equation is dh = (dP/dT) * T (v_v - v_l) / (h_lv). Wait, no, the Clapeyron equation is for the slope of the phase boundary, so maybe rearranged to solve for h_lv.

Alternatively, the formula for latent heat using vapor pressure is h_lv = (P * (v_v - v_l) * R * T) / (M * (1 - (P/P_c))), but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, another approach: the latent heat can be calculated using the equation h_lv = (RT^2 / P) * (dP/dT) * (1/(v_v - v_l)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which is an approximation.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is often written as ln(P2/P1) = (h_lv/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2), but that's when h_lv is constant. But here, I might need to find h_lv at a specific temperature, so perhaps I can take the derivative.

Alternatively, the more accurate form is dh_lv = T (dv) assuming that (dP/dT) = (dh_lv)/(T (v_v - v_l)) ).

Wait, the Clapeyron equation is (dP/dT) = (h_lv)/(T (v_v - v_l)), so rearranging, h_lv = (dP/dT) * T (v_v - v_l).

Yes, that's correct. So I need to find dP/dT at T=2700°F (or 3159.67 R) and then plug into this formula.

So first, I need to compute dP/dT. Since the equation is ln P = (-3.29e4)/T + 14.05, I can differentiate both sides with respect to T. Let's do that.

Taking derivative of ln P with respect to T:

(1/P) dP/dT = d/dT [ (-32900)/T + 14.05 ]

The derivative of (-32900)/T is 32900/(T^2). So,

(1/P) (dP/dT) = 32900/(T^2)

So dP/dT = (32900 P) / (T^2)

Wait, that's correct. Because d/dT (A/T) is -A/T², but here A is negative, so it becomes positive.

So, P is the vapor pressure we found earlier, 37.85 psi. T is 3159.67 R.

So plugging in values:

dP/dT = (32900 * 37.85) / (3159.67)^2

Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate 32900 * 37.85. Let's see, 32900 * 30 is 987,000. 32900 *7.85 is 32900 *7=230,300 and 32900 *0.85=27,965. So 230300 +27965=258,265. So total is 987,000 +258,265=1,245,265.

Denominator is (3159.67)^2. Let me compute that. 3159.67 squared. 3000² is 9e6. 159.67² is about 25,500. The cross term is 2*3000*159.67 = 2*3000=6,000 *159.67≈957,  so total 957,000. So total denominator is 9e6 + 957,000 + 25,500 ≈ 10, 982,500?

Wait, but perhaps better to compute 3159.67^2 directly. 3159.67 * 3159.67. Let me approximate it.

Approximately, 3.15967e3 squared is (3.16)^2 * 1e6 = 9.9856 * 1e6 = 9,985,600. So about 9.9856e6.

So denominator is approx 9.9856e6.

So dP/dT = 1,245,265 / 9.9856e6 ≈ let's compute 1.245e6 / 9.9856e6 = approx 0.1247 psi/R.

Wait, 1.245e6 / ~1e7 is 0.1245.

So dP/dT ≈ 0.1247 psi per Rankine.

Now, the latent heat equation is h_lv = (dP/dT) * T (v_v - v_l).

We have:

dP/dT = 0.1247 psi/R

T = 3159.67 R

v_v is the specific volume of vapor, v_l is specific volume of liquid.

Wait, the densities are given as 25.6 lb_m/ft³ (liquid) and 0.092 lb_m/ft³ (vapor). Specific volume is reciprocal of density, so:

v_l = 1 / 25.6 ≈ 0.0390625 ft³/lbm

v_v = 1 / 0.092 ≈ 10.8696 ft³/lbm

So v_v - v_l ≈ 10.8696 - 0.0390625 ≈ 10.8305 ft³/lbm.

Now, putting it all into the equation:

h_lv = 0.1247 * 3159.67 * 10.8305

Let me compute each step.

First, 0.1247 * 3159.67 = ?

0.1 * 3159.67 = 315.967

0.0247 * 3159.67 ≈ let's compute 0.02 *3159.67 = 63.1934, and 0.0047 *3159.67 ≈ 14.836. So total 63.1934 +14.836=78.029. So 0.1247 *3159.67 ≈ 315.967 +78.029 ≈ 394.

So 394 * 10.8305 ≈ ?

Let me compute 400 *10.8305=4343.2, but since it's 394, which is 6 less than 400, subtract 6*10.8305=65. So 4343.2 -65 = 4278.2 approximately.

Wait, but let me do it more accurately.

394 * 10 = 3940

394 * 0.8305 = ?

394 * 0.8 = 315.2

394 * 0.0305 = 394 * 0.03 =11.82, 394 *0.0005=0.197. So 11.82 +0.197=12.017.

So 315.2 +12.017=327.217.

So 394 *10.8305 = 3940 + 327.217 = 4267.217.

So h_lv ≈ 4267.217 Btu/lbm? Wait, wait. Hold on, the units.

Wait, the units in the formula: Let's check the units.

Clapeyron equation: h_lv = (dP/dT) * T (v_v - v_l)

dP/dT is in psi/R

T is in Rankine

v_v - v_l is in ft³/lbm

So the units become:

psi/R * R * ft³/lbm = psi * ft³/lbm.

But 1 psi-ft³ is equal to 778.169 ft-lbf (since 1 psi = 778.169 ft-lbf/ft², and multiplied by ft³ gives 778.169 ft-lbf).

Wait, perhaps I should think about unit conversion.

Wait, 1 Btu is approximately 778.169 ft·lbf. So I need to convert the result into Btu/lbm.

So h_lv in ft-lbf/lbm is (psi * ft³/lbm). Because:

dP/dT (psi/R) * T (R) = psi.

v_v - v_l (ft³/lbm). So psi * ft³/lbm = (lbf/in²) * ft³ / lbm.

But 1 ft = 12 inches, so ft³ = (12 in)^3 = 1728 in³. And 1 psi is lbf/in².

So psi * ft³ = (lbf/in²) * (1728 in³) = 1728 lbf·in.

But 1 ft·lbf = 12 in·lbf. So 1728 in·lbf = 1728/12 = 144 ft·lbf.

So 1 psi*ft³ = 144 ft·lbf.

So our h_lv is 4267.217 (psi·ft³/lbm) = 4267.217 * 144 ft·lbf/lbm.

But wait, no. Wait, the calculation gave us (psi * ft³/lbm) = 4267.217 psi·ft³/lbm. So to convert to ft·lbf/lbm, multiply by 144.

So 4267.217 * 144 = ?

Let me compute that.

4000 *144=576,000

267.217 *144: 200*144=28,800; 67.217*144≈67 *144=9,648 and 0.217*144≈31. So total 28,800 +9,648=38,448 +31=38,479.

So total h_lv is 576,000 + 38,479 = 614,479 ft·lbf/lbm.

But 1 Btu = 778.169 ft·lbf, so h_lv = 614479 / 778.169 ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 614479 by 778.169:

Let me approximate. 778 * 790 = 778*(800-10) = 778*800=622,400 minus 778*10=7,780 → 622400-7780=614,620.

Wait, wait, 778 * 790 = 614,620.

But our numerator is 614,479, which is 614,620 -141. So 790 - (141/778) ≈ 790 - 0.181≈789.819.

So approximately 789.82 Btu/lbm.

Wait, but wait, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Because the options given are around 7000-8500 Btu/lbm.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the units somewhere. Let me retrace.

Ah, wait, in the Clapeyron equation, the units are:

h_lv = (dP/dT) * T (v_v - v_l)

But wait, the specific volumes may have been in ft³/lbm, but what about the gas constant R? Because in the Clapeyron equation, sometimes R appears, but perhaps in the form I used, it's derived without R.

Wait, another approach: I think I might have missed the gas constant in the Clapeyron equation. Let me think again.

The Clapeyron equation is (dP/dT) = (h_lv)/(T (v_v - v_l)).

Wait, so h_lv = (dP/dT) * T (v_v - v_l).

But what about the units? Let me double-check.

Yes, because in the Clapeyron equation, the latent heat has units of energy per mass (e.g., Btu/lbm). So when I compute (dP/dT in psi/R) * (T in R) → (psi) → then multiplied by (v_v - v_l in ft³/lbm) → (psi * ft³ / lbm).

As earlier, 1 psi*ft³ = 144 ft·lbf, so h_lv in ft·lbf/lbm is 4267 * 144 = 614,448 ft·lbf/lbm.

Divide by 778.169 to get Btu/lbm: 614448 /778.169 ≈ 790 Btu/lbm.

But that's way lower than any of the options. So I'm definitely missing something here. Let me reconsider.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the differentiation step. Let me go back.

The original equation is ln P = (-3.29e4)/T +14.05.

Taking derivative with respect to T:

d(lnP)/dT = (3.29e4)/T².

So (1/P) dP/dT = 3.29e4 / T² → dP/dT = (3.29e4 * P ) / T².

Wait, earlier I think I wrote 32900 as 3.29e4, correct. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for P? Wait, when T is 3159.67 R, P is calculated as e^(3.634) = around 37.85 psi. That seems correct.

So dP/dT = (32900 * 37.85) / (3159.67)^2.

Calculating numerator: 32900 *37.85.

Hmm, let me compute 32900 *37.85 accurately.

37.85 = 30 +7.85.

32900 *30 = 987,000.

32900 *7 = 230,300.

32900 *0.85 = let's compute 32900 *0.8=26,320 and 32900 *0.05=1,645. So total 26,320 +1,645=27,965.

So 230,300 +27,965=258,265.

So total numerator: 987,000 +258,265=1,245,265.

Denominator: (3159.67)^2 ≈ 3159.67 *3159.67.

Let me compute it more accurately.

3159.67 * 3159.67:

= (3000 + 159.67) * (3000 +159.67)

= 3000² + 2*3000*159.67 +159.67²

=9,000,000 + 2*3000*159.67 + (approx) 159.67².

Compute each term:

3000² =9e6.

2*3000*159.67=6000 *159.67=6000*(160 -0.33)=6000*160=960,000 minus 6000*0.33=1,980 →958,020.

159.67 squared: approx (160)^2 =25,600, but subtract 2*160*0.33 + (0.33)^2 → 160^2 =25600, 2*160*.33=105.6, 0.33^2=0.1089. So approx 25600 -105.6 -0.1089=25494.29.

So total denominator ≈9e6 +958,020 +25,494.29=9,983,514.29.

So denominator ≈9,983,514.

So dP/dT =1,245,265 /9,983,514 ≈ approx 0.1248 psi/R.

So that's correct.

Now, T is 3159.67 R, v_v - v_l is 10.8305 ft³/lbm.

So h_lv = 0.1248 * 3159.67 * 10.8305.

Compute step by step:

0.1248 *3159.67 = let's compute 0.1 *3159.67=315.967.

0.02 *3159.67=63.1934.

0.0048 *3159.67 ≈ 15.165.

Adding all: 315.967 +63.1934=379.1604 +15.165=394.3254.

Then, 394.3254 *10.8305.

Let me compute that accurately.

394 *10=3940.

394 *0.8305= ?

394 *0.8=315.2.

394 *0.0305=12.017.

So 315.2 +12.017=327.217.

So 394 *10.8305=3940 +327.217=4267.217.

Plus the 0.3254 part: 0.3254 *10.8305≈3.525.

So total h_lv ≈4267.217 +3.525≈4270.74 psi·ft³/lbm.

Wait, no, because 0.1248 * 3159.67 = 394
