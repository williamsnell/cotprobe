Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about amino acids and carbohydrates. The question is asking which feature amino acids have that's not found in carbohydrates. The options are A to D, each listing different atoms. Hmm, let me think this through.

First, I remember that amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Each amino acid has a specific structure. The general formula, right? They have an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxyl group (-COOH) attached to a central carbon. So that means they must contain nitrogen because the amino group has NH2. 

Now, what about carbohydrates? Carbs are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Their basic formula is something like (CH2O)n, right? So they don't have nitrogen in them. 

Looking back at the question, it's asking which feature amino acids have that's not present in carbs. So the options are carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen. 

Wait, both amino acids and carbs have carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Because amino acids have those in their structure. But the key difference is the nitrogen. Amino acids have nitrogen from the amino group, while carbs don't have any nitrogen. 

So the correct answer should be the presence of nitrogen atoms. Let me check the options again. Option C is nitrogen atoms. So the answer must be C.

The question asks which feature amino acids have that is not found in carbohydrates. Amino acids are characterized by the presence of an amino group (-NH2), which contains nitrogen, whereas carbohydrates are composed solely of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (general formula: (CH2O)n). Since carbohydrates lack nitrogen, the distinguishing feature of amino acids is the presence of nitrogen atoms.

A: Carbon atoms - Both amino acids and carbohydrates contain carbon.  
B: Oxygen atoms - Both amino acids and carbohydrates contain oxygen.  
C: Nitrogen atoms - Amino acids have nitrogen, but carbohydrates do not.  
D: Hydrogen atoms - Both amino acids and carbohydrates contain hydrogen.  

The correct answer is **C: nitrogen atoms**.
