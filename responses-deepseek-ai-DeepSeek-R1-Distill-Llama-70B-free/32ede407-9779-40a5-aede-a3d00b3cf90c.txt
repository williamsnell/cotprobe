Okay, so I have this question about the effective rate of yield for a stock. Hmm, I remember that yield has something to do with the return an investor gets. Let me think. Oh right, the dividend yield is the ratio of the annual dividend payment to the stock's current price. 

The question says the stock is selling for $60 and pays an annual dividend of $2. So I think I need to divide the dividend by the stock price. Let me write that down: Dividend Yield = Dividend / Stock Price. 

So plugging in the numbers, that's $2 divided by $60. Let's calculate that. 2 divided by 60 equals... 0.033333... which is the same as 3.333... percent. Oh wait, 3.333% is the same as 3 and 1/3 percent. Because 1/3 is approximately 0.3333. 

Looking at the options, option B is 3 1/3%. So that should be the correct answer. The other options don't fit. Option A is 2.5%, which is too low. Option C is 4%, higher than our calculation. Option D is 5%, way higher. So yeah, B makes sense.

The effective rate of yield, or dividend yield, is calculated by dividing the annual dividend by the stock's current price. For a stock selling at $60 with a $2 annual dividend, the yield is:

\[
\text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{\$2}{\$60} = 0.0333\ldots \approx 3\frac{1}{3}\%.
\]

Among the options, the correct answer is **B: 3(1/3)%**.

Answer: B
