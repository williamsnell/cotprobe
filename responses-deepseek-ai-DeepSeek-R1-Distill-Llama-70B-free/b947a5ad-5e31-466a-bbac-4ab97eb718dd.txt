Okay, so I've got this problem here about Norman Stevens and his property taxes. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I need to find out how much of his tax is passed along to the county government. 

Alright, the problem states that 28% of the property tax goes to the county. Norman's home was assessed at $17,400. The town's tax rate is $24.90 per $1,000 of assessed value. I think the first thing I need to do is calculate the total property tax Norman has to pay, and then find 28% of that amount.

So, the tax rate is $24.90 per thousand dollars. His home is assessed at $17,400. I remember that to find the tax, you take the assessed value, divide by 1000, then multiply by the tax rate. Let me write that out.

First, calculate the taxable amount in thousands. $17,400 divided by $1,000 is 17.4. Then, multiply that by the tax rate of $24.90. So 17.4 times 24.90. Let me do that multiplication. 

Wait, 17 times 24 is 408, and 0.4 times 24 is 9.6. For the 0.90 part, 17 times 0.90 is 15.3, and 0.4 times 0.90 is 0.36. Hmm, maybe it's easier to just multiply 17.4 by 24.90 directly.

Let me compute that. 17.4 * 24.90. Let me break it down:

17.4 * 24 = 417.6
17.4 * 0.90 = 15.66
Adding those together: 417.6 + 15.66 = 433.26.

So, the total property tax Norman pays is $433.26. Now, the town passes 28% of this tax to the county. So I need to find 28% of $433.26.

Calculating 28%: I can convert that to decimal, which is 0.28. So 433.26 * 0.28.

Let me compute that. 400 * 0.28 is 112. 33.26 * 0.28 is... let's see. 30 * 0.28 = 8.4, 3.26 * 0.28. 3 times 0.28 is 0.84, 0.26 * 0.28 is 0.0728. So adding those: 8.4 + 0.84 is 9.24, plus 0.0728 is 9.3128. So 112 + 9.3128 is 121.3128.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should just multiply 433.26 by 0.28 more accurately. Let's see:

433.26 * 0.28:
0.28 is 28 cents, so 433.26 * 28 = ?

Let me compute 433 * 28. 400*28=11200, 33*28=924. So 11200 + 924 = 12124. Then, 0.26 * 28 is 7.28. So total is 12124 + 7.28 = 12131.28 cents. Wait, because 433.26 is dollars, so 0.28 is 28 cents, so the product would be in dollars.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Alternatively, 433.26 * 0.28: let's compute step by step.

433.26 * 0.2 = 86.652
433.26 * 0.08 = 34.6608
Add them together: 86.652 + 34.6608 = 121.3128 dollars.

So the amount passed to the county is $121.3128. Looking at the options, I see option F is $121.31, which matches this number.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because the options given include F as $121.31, which is exactly what I got. So that should be the correct answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the initial steps. The assessed value is $17,400, tax rate is $24.90 per $1,000. So 17,400 /1000 =17.4. 17.4 *24.90= 433.26. Then 28% of that is 121.31. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be F.

To determine how much of Norman Stevens' property tax is passed along to the county government, we start by calculating his total property tax. The tax rate is $24.90 per $1,000 of assessed value, and his home is assessed at $17,400. 

First, divide the assessed value by $1,000 to find the taxable amount in thousands:  
\[
\frac{17,400}{1,000} = 17.4
\]  

Next, multiply this by the tax rate:  
\[
17.4 \times 24.90 = 433.26
\]  

This means Norman's total property tax is $433.26. Since 28% of this tax is passed along to the county government, we calculate 28% of $433.26:  
\[
433.26 \times 0.28 = 121.31
\]  

Thus, the amount of tax passed along to the county government is $121.31. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is **F: $121.31**.

**Answer: F**
