Question:

During a paternity trial, the mother's attorney asks to have the baby girl, now 36 months old, exhibited for the purpose of calling attention to certain facial resemblances between the child and the reputed father. The defendant's attorney objects to the offering of the baby into evidence for comparison. The trial judge should

Options:

A: permit the child to be exhibited as a non-objectionable form of demonstrative evidence.
B: not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would violate the child's rights.
C: not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would be self-serving to the complainant.
D: not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would be highly prejudicial to the defendant.
E: permit the child to be exhibited as within the hearsay exception of pedigree.
F: not permit the child to be exhibited, as it could emotionally distress the child.
G: permit the child to be exhibited, but only under specific conditions set by the court.
H: permit the child to be exhibited, as it may provide relevant evidence to the jury.
I: not permit the child to be exhibited, as the physical resemblance is not a scientifically reliable form of evidence.
J: permit the child to be exhibited, but only if both parties agree to it.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this paternity trial question. So, the situation is that the mother's attorney wants to present the baby girl, who's 36 months old, to show facial resemblance to the alleged father. The defendant's attorney objects. The question is what the trial judge should do.

First, I need to think about evidence law. I remember that physical appearance can be relevant in certain cases, like paternity. But how is that handled in court?

I think about demonstrative evidence. Demonstrative evidence is used to help the jury understand other evidence. Like, a diagram or a model. But a person's appearanceâ€”can that be considered demonstrative evidence? Maybe. I recall that sometimes people are brought into court for the jury to observe features, like in cases where someone's identity or condition is in question.

Wait, but in this case, the baby is being exhibited specifically for facial resemblance. Is that allowed? Well, physical resemblance is a type of evidence that's relevant to paternity. It's not definitive, but it can be a factor. So the judge might allow it because it's relevant.

I should consider the possible objections. The defendant's attorney is objecting, but the options are about why. Let's look at the options:

Option A says permit as non-objectionable demonstrative evidence. So, treating the child as evidence for comparison. I think that's possible because it's a form of visual evidence.

Option B says it violates the child's rights. But I'm not sure what specific right that would be. Privacy maybe? But in a trial, especially when the child is the subject, courts often allow this. Plus, it's about paternity, which concerns the child's own interests.

Option C says it's self-serving. But all evidence presented by a party is self-serving. The issue is whether it's admissible, not if it's self-serving.

Option D says it's prejudicial to the defendant. Prejudice is a consideration, but relevance usually outweighs unless it's highly prejudicial without much probative value. Here, resemblance does have some probative value in paternity.

Option E mentions hearsay exception of pedigree. I don't think that's relevant here. Pedigree is more about family history, not physical appearance.

Option F says it could emotionally distress the child. The child is 3 years old. Being in court might be stressful, but the question doesn't state that the child would be testifying, just exhibited. Maybe the court can manage it without causing harm.

Option G says permit but under specific conditions. That's possible, but the question is whether the judge should permit it at all, not the conditions.

Option H says permit as relevant evidence. That seems plausible because resemblance is relevant to paternity.

Option I says not permit because resemblance isn't scientifically reliable. While DNA is more reliable, physical resemblance can still be considered by the jury as one piece of evidence.

Option J says permit only if both parties agree. I don't think that's a requirement. The judge can decide admissibility without both sides agreeing.

So, the key issue is whether the child can be exhibited for the jury to observe resemblance. I think courts generally allow this kind of evidence. It's a form of demonstrative evidence, so option A or H could be correct.

Wait, A says it's a non-objectionable form of demonstrative evidence. H says it's relevant. So which is more accurate?

Demonstrative evidence is about helping the jury understand, but physical resemblance is substantive evidence regarding paternity. So perhaps H is better because it's about relevance, not just demonstration.

But wait, the question is about exhibiting the child. So the child isn't testifying; they're just being shown. That would be more like a demonstration. So maybe option A is the right choice.

Alternatively, some might argue that it's not just a demonstration but substantive evidence of resemblance, making it relevant under H.

I'm a bit torn. I think the correct approach is that the trial judge has discretion to allow such evidence as it's relevant. So the answer would be H.

The question revolves around whether a trial judge should permit a 36-month-old child to be exhibited in court for the purpose of showing facial resemblance to the reputed father in a paternity trial. The mother's attorney seeks to present the child as evidence, while the defendant's attorney objects. The analysis considers the admissibility of such evidence under evidence law principles.

1. **Option A**: This suggests permitting the child as a form of non-objectionable demonstrative evidence. Demonstrative evidence is typically used to aid the jury's understanding, and exhibiting the child could fall into this category as it visually demonstrates resemblance.

2. **Option B**: This argues that exhibiting the child violates its rights. However, courts often allow such exhibitions when the child is central to the case, as in paternity proceedings, and no specific right is clearly violated here.

3. **Option C**: This claims the evidence is self-serving to the complainant. While all evidence presented by a party is inherently self-serving, the issue is admissibility, not self-interest.

4. **Option D**: This states the exhibition is prejudicial to the defendant. While prejudice is a consideration, relevance generally outweighs prejudice unless the evidence is highly inflammatory or lacking probative value. Here, resemblance has some probative value in paternity cases.

5. **Option E**: This mentions the hearsay exception of pedigree, which is irrelevant because the issue is physical resemblance, not family history.

6. **Option F**: This concerns emotional distress to the child. While court proceedings can be stressful, the child is not testifying, and the court can manage the situation to minimize harm.

7. **Option G**: This suggests permitting the exhibition under specific conditions. While conditions might be imposed, the question focuses on whether to permit it at all.

8. **Option H**: This argues the evidence is relevant to the jury. Physical resemblance is indeed relevant in paternity cases, even if not definitive, making this a strong option.

9. **Option I**: This claims resemblance is not scientifically reliable. While DNA evidence is more reliable, physical resemblance can still be considered by the jury as one piece of evidence.

10. **Option J**: This suggests requiring both parties' agreement. Admissibility is determined by the judge, not by mutual agreement.

The key consideration is whether the child's exhibition is admissible as relevant evidence or demonstrative evidence. While both A and H are plausible, H is more accurate because the exhibition provides substantive evidence of resemblance, which is directly relevant to paternity. Demonstrative evidence is more about aiding understanding, whereas this evidence speaks to the merits of the case.
