Okay, so I have this question about psychology, right? It's asking about the difference between consciousness and awareness, and also to define automatic behavior. Hmm, I remember from my notes that these terms are related but distinct.

Wait, consciousness is like being aware of your surroundings, thoughts, and feelings. It's the state of being conscious. Awareness is more specific, maybe? Like, being aware of something particular. So, consciousness is a broader term, and awareness is a part of it. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Maybe I should look it up, but since I can't right now, I'll go with that understanding.

Now, the main part is defining automatic behavior. From what I remember, automatic behaviors are actions that we do without much conscious thought. Like driving a car when you're experienced; you don't think about every step, you just do it. So it's something that doesn't require concentration or effort because it's learned and becomes a habit.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Automatic behavior with high emotional engagement. That doesn't sound right. Emotional engagement would probably require some awareness or consciousness, not automatic.

Option B: Without much concentration and effort. Yeah, that fits with what I was thinking. It's like when you do something on autopilot.

Option C: Only in deep meditation. No, that doesn't make sense. Meditation is more about focus, not automatic actions.

Option D: Subconscious response. Hmm, I think automatic behaviors are more about learned habits rather than being subconscious. Subconscious might be more instinctual or not learned.

Option E: Requires full concentration. That's the opposite of automatic, so no.

Option F: Random response without prior learning. No, automatic behaviors are usually learned over time, like riding a bike.

Option G: Involuntary physiological processes. That's more like reflexes, not behaviors we perform. Like heartbeats, which you can't control.

Option H: Learned but requires planning each time. No, because once it's learned, you don't need to plan each time.

Option I: Same as conscious behavior. No, automatic is the opposite.

Option J: Requires full awareness. Again, opposite. So the correct answer must be B.

The question asks about the difference between consciousness and awareness and the definition of automatic behavior. Consciousness refers to being aware of one's surroundings, thoughts, and feelings, while awareness is a more specific focus on particular stimuli or events. Automatic behavior, on the other hand, involves actions performed without much concentration or effort, often as a result of learning and habit formation.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Emotional engagement typically requires awareness, not automatic behavior.
- **B**: Correct. Automatic behavior is performed without much concentration or effort.
- **C**: Incorrect. Automatic behavior is not limited to deep meditation.
- **D**: Incorrect. While subconscious, automatic behavior is learned, not purely instinctual.
- **E**: Incorrect. Automatic behavior does not require full concentration.
- **F**: Incorrect. Automatic behavior is learned, not random.
- **G**: Incorrect. This describes involuntary physiological processes, not behaviors.
- **H**: Incorrect. Automatic behavior does not require deliberate planning.
- **I**: Incorrect. Automatic behavior is not the same as conscious behavior.
- **J**: Incorrect. Automatic behavior does not require full awareness.

The correct answer is **B**.

Answer: B
