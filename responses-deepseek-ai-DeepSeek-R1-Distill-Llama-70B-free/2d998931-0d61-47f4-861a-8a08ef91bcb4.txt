Okay, so I've got this question about meteorites and what they reveal about the solar system. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let's think this through step by step.

First, I remember that meteorites are pieces of rocks or metal that fall to Earth from space. They're remnants from the early solar system, right? So they probably tell us something about the solar system's formation or composition.

Looking at the options:

Option A says meteorites reveal the solar system was once part of a larger galaxy. Hmm, I don't think that's right. Meteorites are more about the solar system itself, not its relation to other galaxies. Plus, I don't recall anything about the solar system being part of a larger galaxy before.

Option B suggests all planets once had life. That doesn't sound accurate. I mean, meteorites might carry organic molecules, but that doesn't mean every planet had life. Plus, it's a big statement—like Mercury, Venus, gas giants having life? I don't think so.

Option C says they reveal the solar system's age is about 4.6 billion years. Oh wait, I remember something about radiometric dating of meteorites. Scientists use elements like lead and uranium in meteorites to determine the solar system's age. So this might be the correct option.

Option D claims the solar system is expanding at a constant rate. I don't think so. The solar system's expansion, if any, isn't something I've heard about. It's more about the universe expanding, like the cosmic expansion, but not the solar system itself.

Option E states meteorites are remnants of a fifth terrestrial planet. Oh, right! I think this refers to the asteroid belt. Some theories suggest that a planet might have been there but didn't form, so meteorites could be remnants from that. But wait, is that the case? I think some meteorites are from that region, but does that mean they're remnants of a planet that formed? Or just leftover material? I'm a bit fuzzy here, but I'll keep this in mind.

Option F says the solar system once had 10 planets. I don't think so. The solar system's planet count has changed over time, like Pluto's reclassification, but 10 planets isn't something I've heard. Maybe in some models, but not from meteorites.

Option G claims meteorites are older than comets and planets. Wait, no—the planets formed after the solar system's formation, and meteorites are from that early time. Comets are also ancient, but I think meteorites and comets are about the same age. So G doesn't seem right.

Option H says the solar system always had 8 planets. Well, Pluto was considered the ninth, so that's not true. Plus, the number might have changed beyond what we know, but I don't think meteorites would reveal that.

Option I suggests the early solar system was mostly hydrogen and helium. That makes sense because the sun is mostly those elements, and the initial solar nebula would have those. But what do meteorites tell us about that? I'm not sure. Maybe the absence of these gases in meteorites indicates that the gas was blown away, so it's consistent, but I'm not certain if that's what meteorites reveal.

Option J says the solar system is much younger. No, I think the 4.6 billion years is a well-established number, so J is probably wrong.

So narrowing it down, option C and E are possible. Let me think again. Radiometric dating of meteorites gives the solar system's age as about 4.6 billion years. That's a key point I remember from my studies. So C is correct.

Option E about the fifth planet—I think that's the idea of the missing planet that might have been in the asteroid belt. But I'm not sure if that's widely accepted or if meteorites directly reveal that. It might be a theory, but the question is about what meteorites reveal, so maybe E is a possible answer, but not as certain as C.

Wait, another point: Some meteorites are thought to have come from Mars or other planets, but that's not about revealing the solar system's age. So I think the key point is that the age comes from meteorites. So the correct answer should be C.

Meteorites are remnants from the early solar system and provide critical insights into its formation and history. Among the options provided:

- **Option A** is incorrect because meteorites do not provide evidence about the solar system being part of a larger galaxy.
- **Option B** is incorrect as meteorites do not suggest that all planets once had life, though they may carry organic molecules.
- **Option C** is correct because radiometric dating of meteorites has established the solar system's age as approximately 4.6 billion years.
- **Option D** is incorrect as there is no evidence that the solar system is expanding at a constant rate.
- **Option E** refers to the idea that meteorites might be remnants of a fifth terrestrial planet, but this is speculative and not definitively revealed by meteorites.
- **Option F** is incorrect as there is no evidence from meteorites that the solar system once had 10 planets.
- **Option G** is incorrect because meteorites are not older than comets and planets; they are all remnants from the same early solar system.
- **Option H** is incorrect as the solar system has not always consisted of only 8 planets (e.g., Pluto was previously classified as the ninth planet).
- **Option I** is plausible but not directly revealed by meteorites, as the early solar system's composition of hydrogen and helium is inferred from other observations.
- **Option J** is incorrect because meteorites confirm the solar system's age as approximately 4.6 billion years, not that it is younger.

The most accurate answer is **Option C**, as meteorites provide direct evidence for the solar system's age through radiometric dating.

Answer: C
