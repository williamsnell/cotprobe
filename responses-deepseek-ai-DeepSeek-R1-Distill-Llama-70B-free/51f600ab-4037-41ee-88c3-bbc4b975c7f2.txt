Okay, so I've got this question about return on invested capital, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The data given is: 

- Net investments as of December 31, 1966: $250,000
- Net investments as of December 31, 1967: $350,000
- Net sales for the year ended Dec 31, 1967: $600,000
- Net income for the same period: $25,000

And I need to find the return on invested capital (ROIC) to the nearest tenth of a percent. The options are from A to J, each with different percentages.

Hmm, I remember that ROIC is a financial metric that measures how well a company uses the capital invested in its operations. The formula, I think, is ROIC = Net Income / Invested Capital. But wait, what's the exact formula again? Oh right, Invested Capital is usually the average of the beginning and ending balances, especially when the investments have changed during the period.

So in this case, the invested capital isn't just the ending balance. Because the net investments increased from $250k to $350k during 1967. So I should take the average of these two to find the invested capital used during the year.

Let me write that down. Invested Capital = (Beginning Net Investments + Ending Net Investments) / 2. So that would be (250,000 + 350,000) / 2. Let me calculate that: 600,000 divided by 2 is 300,000. So the average invested capital is $300,000.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Sometimes, I've heard of using the ending value as the invested capital, but in this case, since it's a year-long period and the investment changed, averaging makes more sense, right? Because the capital wasn't all $350k for the whole year; it started lower and increased.

So moving on, the net income is $25,000. So ROIC would be 25,000 divided by 300,000. Let me do that calculation.

25,000 รท 300,000 equals... let's see, 25 divided by 300 is 0.083333... So that's 8.333... percent. Rounded to the nearest tenth, that would be 8.3%.

Looking at the options, option F is 8.3%. So that's the answer, right?

Wait a second, maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, maybe the formula uses total capital at the end? Let me think again. If I use ending capital of 350,000, then 25k divided by 350k is approximately 7.14%, which is about 7.1%. That's option B.

But I'm pretty sure that when calculating returns over a period where the investment changes, the average is more accurate. So I think using the average is correct. So the correct ROIC should be around 8.3%, which is option F.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider other factors. Is there another formula where the invested capital is calculated differently, like using only the beginning or the end? I'm trying to remember. Oh wait, sometimes in ROIC, the denominator is the total capital at the end of the period, especially in certain contexts or simplified calculations. But I think for a more accurate reflection, using the average is better because the capital amount changed during the year.

So to confirm, the correct way is to average the beginning and ending invested capital. So 250k plus 350k is 600k, divided by 2 is 300k. Then 25k divided by 300k is 8.333...%, which is 8.3% when rounded to the nearest tenth.

So the correct answer should be F: 8.3%.

To calculate the return on invested capital (ROIC), we use the formula:

\[
ROIC = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Invested Capital}}
\]

The invested capital is the average of the beginning and ending net investments during the period, as the capital changed from $250,000 to $350,000. Thus:

\[
\text{Invested Capital} = \frac{\text{Beginning Net Investments} + \text{Ending Net Investments}}{2} = \frac{250,000 + 350,000}{2} = 300,000
\]

The net income for the year is $25,000. Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
ROIC = \frac{25,000}{300,000} = 0.083333\ldots \approx 8.333\%
\]

Rounding to the nearest tenth of a percent gives:

\[
ROIC \approx 8.3\%
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **F: 8.3%**.
