Question:

Police were conducting a house-to-house search for an escaped convict. During the search, a police officer went to a home and rang the doorbell. When a teenage male opened the door, the police officer told him that a convict had escaped and asked if he had seen anyone suspicious in the neighborhood. The teenager said he hadn't but then asked the police officer to come inside to ensure the house was safe. The police officer entered the home and proceeded to look around. When he went into the kitchen, the police officer noticed a bag containing white powder on the counter. Suspecting that the bag contained narcotics, the police officer questioned the teenager as to its contents. The teenager said he didn't live in the house and had never seen it before. The police officer confiscated the bag and took the teenager to the station house for questioning, at which time it was determined that the teenager had escaped from a psychiatric hospital and had broken into the home earlier in the day. Furthermore, the results of a police lab test found that the bag contained heroin. As a result, the police issued an arrest warrant for the owner of the home. He was apprehended and charged with possession of heroin. The homeowner's attorney has filed a motion to suppress, claiming that the heroin confiscated by the police was unlawfully obtained. The motion should be

Options:

A: denied, because the teenager gave consent for the police officer to enter and search the home.
B: denied, because the police officer reasonably believed that he had permission to enter the dwelling and reasonably believed that the teenager was competent to give consent.
C: granted, because the teenager did not have an ownership or shared occupancy interest in the premises.
D: denied, because the police officer reasonably believed that he had permission to enter the dwelling.
E: denied, because the police officer was invited into the home by the teenager.
F: granted, because the police officer did not have a warrant to search the house.
G: granted, because the police officer did not have probable cause to search the house.
H: denied, because the police officer suspected that the bag contained narcotics.
I: granted, because the homeowner was not present during the search.
J: granted, because the teenager did not have the authority to consent to a search of the house.

Okay, so I've got this legal question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by breaking down the scenario step by step.

So, the situation is that the police are searching for an escaped convict. They go house to house, and an officer comes to a home where a teenage male answers the door. The officer tells the teen about the escaped convict and asks if he's seen anything suspicious. The teen says no, then invites the officer inside to make sure the house is safe. The officer enters, looks around, and in the kitchen finds a bag of white powder. He questions the teen, who claims he doesn't live there and hasn't seen the bag before. The officer confiscates the bag and takes the teen in for questioning. It turns out the teen had escaped from a psychiatric hospital and had broken into the home earlier. The bag tests positive for heroin, and now the homeowner is charged with possession. The defense is moving to suppress the evidence, saying it was unlawfully obtained.

The question is whether the motion to suppress should be granted or denied. The options are from A to J, each presenting a different legal reasoning.

Alright, I'm a bit rusty on my Fourth Amendment law, but I remember that consent is a big issue here. For a search to be legal without a warrant, consent must be given by someone with authority to do so.

In this case, the officer was let in by the teenager. But the teen didn't live there—he was actually a trespasser who broke in. So, the question is whether the teen had the authority to consent to the officer's entry and subsequent search.

I recall the case of Illinois v. Rodriguez, where the Supreme Court held that the crucial factor is whether the police reasonably believed that the person giving consent had authority over the premises. If the person giving consent doesn't actually have that authority, but the police reasonably believe they do, the search is still valid.

In this scenario, the teen didn't live there, so he didn't have actual authority. But did the officer have reason to believe he did? The teen opened the door, so perhaps the officer thought he was a resident. The officer asked to come in to check the house's safety, which the teen allowed.

Wait, but the teen was a trespasser. So, his consent wouldn't bind the homeowner. But if the officer didn't know that and reasonably believed the teen had authority, that might make the consent valid.

Looking at the options, option B says the motion should be denied because the officer reasonably believed he had permission and that the teen was competent to consent. That sounds like it's invoking the reasoning from Rodriguez.

Option C and J argue that the teen didn't have ownership interest, so the consent was invalid. But if the officer's belief was reasonable, then under Rodriguez, the evidence isn't suppressed.

Another thought: when the officer entered, he was there to check the house's safety, which might be considered a protective sweep. But I don't think that's the case here—more like a consensual entry. Once inside, he saw the bag in plain view, which might be a different issue. But the initial entry's legality is the key.

If the initial entry was lawful based on the teen's consent, then the officer's observation of the heroin in plain view would be admissible. But if the entry was unlawful, then the evidence is suppressed.

So, focusing on the consent issue. The homeowner's attorney argues that the evidence was unlawfully obtained because the teen couldn't consent. But the officer might have reasonably thought the teen was authorized.

I think the correct answer hinges on whether the teen's consent was valid, considering his status. Since he didn't live there, his consent wouldn't typically suffice. However, if the officer reasonably believed he did, the search stands.

Looking at the options, option B seems to capture that reasoning. It states the officer reasonably believed he had permission and the teen was competent to consent. So the motion should be denied.

Other options: Option A says the teen gave consent, but that's not enough if the teen lacked authority. Option E says the teen invited him, but again, authority matters. Option C and J focus on the teen's lack of authority, but the officer's reasonable belief might override that.

Wait, but if the teen was a trespasser, then even if the officer didn't know, the consent wouldn't be valid, right? Because a trespasser can't give consent for the homeowner. So maybe the motion should be granted because the teen had no authority, regardless of the officer's belief.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the cases. Let me think again. In Rodriguez, the defendant's girlfriend gave consent, but she didn't have authority. The police thought she did, so the evidence was admissible. But in cases where the person giving consent is a trespasser, would that change things?

Alternatively, maybe the teen's invitation to check the house for safety is a form of consent, but since he wasn't a resident, it's invalid. But the officer didn't know that, so perhaps the reasonable belief still applies.

Wait, but the Rodriguez case involved a girlfriend who had her own key, so the police could reasonably think she had authority. In this case, the teen opened the door, implying he might live there. The officer might have no reason to think otherwise.

So, I think option B is correct because the officer's reasonable belief that the teen could consent makes the search valid.

The motion to suppress should be denied because the police officer reasonably believed that the teenager had authority to consent to the search of the home. Under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, particularly as established in *Illinois v. Rodriguez*, the validity of a consent search depends on whether the police reasonably believed that the person giving consent had authority over the premises. In this case, the teenager opened the door and invited the officer inside, creating a reasonable impression that he had authority to consent to the officer's entry. Although the teenager was later found to be a trespasser with no actual authority, the officer's belief was reasonable under the circumstances. Therefore, the search was lawful, and the motion to suppress should be denied.
