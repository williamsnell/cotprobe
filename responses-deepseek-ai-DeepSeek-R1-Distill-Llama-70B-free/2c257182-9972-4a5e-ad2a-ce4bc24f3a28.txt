Question:

According to the Solar Nebular theory what are asteroids and comets?

Options:

A: They are the shattered remains of collisions between planets.
B: They are chunks of rock or ice that condensed long after the planets and moons had formed.
C: They are solidified lava from the early solar system.
D: They are leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets.
E: They are remnants of the original nebular cloud that didn't form into a planet.
F: They are debris from the creation of the universe.
G: They are fragments from the explosion of a massive star.
H: They are chunks of rock or ice that were formed by the condensation of space dust.
I: They are chunks of rock or ice that were expelled from planets by volcanoes.
J: They are pieces of planets that were torn apart by gravitational forces.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the Solar Nebular theory and what asteroids and comets are according to it. Hmm, I remember that the Solar Nebular theory explains the formation of the solar system. Let me think...

Wait, the question is specifically about asteroids and comets. I think in this theory, the solar system formed from a giant cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. This nebula collapsed under gravity, and as it spun, it flattened into a disk shape. The Sun formed at the center, and the planets formed from the disk.

Now, what about the leftover stuff? I remember that small particles in the disk stuck together, forming larger bodies called planetesimals. These planetesimals eventually came together to form the planets. But not all of them did, right? Some remained as smaller bodies.

Oh right, asteroids are mostly found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. They're rocky objects. Comets are more icy and are usually found farther out, like in the Kuiper belt or Oort cloud. So according to the theory, these are leftovers from the formation of the planets.

Looking at the options, option D says they're leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets. That sounds right. Planetesimals that didn't get incorporated into planets would remain as asteroids and comets.

Let me double-check the other options. Option E says remnants of the original nebula that didn't form a planet. Well, the nebula was mostly gas and dust, but the planetesimals are the condensed bits, so D is more precise.

Option H says chunks formed by condensation of space dust. That's part of it, but H doesn't mention that they're leftovers that didn't form into planets.

So I think the correct answer is D.

According to the Solar Nebular theory, asteroids and comets are leftover planetesimals that never accreted into planets. These small bodies formed from the solar nebula but were not incorporated into the planets during the solar system's formation. 

The correct answer is D.
