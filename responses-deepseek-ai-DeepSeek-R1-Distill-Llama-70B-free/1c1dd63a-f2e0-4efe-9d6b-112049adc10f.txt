Question:

Police received information from a reliable informant that a defendant would be extorting money from a victim. The informant gave the police explicit details about the extortion scheme: the defendant would be calling the victim from a public phone booth on a particular street corner on a certain date and time to make the extortionist demand. Without notif'ing the telephone company or seeking a warrant, the police installed an eavesdropping device on the public phone. At the time on the date specified by the informant, the defendant phoned the victim from the telephone booth and said, "You better pay me $5,000 by next week or I'll kill you and your family. " The defendant provided additional details about how and where to make the payoff. Based on the taped conversation, the police arrested the defendant and charged him with extortion. Prior to trial, the defendant's attorney moves to exclude the taped conversation from evidence. The defense motion should be

Options:

A: granted, because the police should have obtained a court order before recording the conversation.
B: denied, because the police had probable cause based on the information supplied by the informant.
C: denied, because the defendant did not have reasonable expectation of privacy.
D: granted, because the police violated the defendant's rights by not informing him of the eavesdropping device.
E: denied, because the information from the informant was reliable and specific.
F: granted, because the police did not obtain prior approval of the telephone company before installing the eavesdropping device.
G: denied, because the threat made by the defendant was a serious crime.
H: granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device.
I: granted, because the defendant was not aware of the eavesdropping device.
J: denied, because the phone booth is a public place with no expectation of privacy.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about criminal procedure and the admissibility of evidence obtained through eavesdropping. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is that police received information from a reliable informant about an extortion scheme. The informant provided specific details: the defendant would call the victim from a public phone booth at a certain time and date. The police then installed an eavesdropping device on the public phone without notifying the telephone company or getting a warrant. When the defendant made the call as predicted, the police taped the conversation where he made threats and gave payoff details. Now, the defendant's attorney is moving to exclude this taped conversation from evidence. The question is whether this motion should be granted or denied.

I remember that under the Fourth Amendment, the government generally needs a warrant to conduct searches or surveillance. However, there are exceptions, especially concerning public places. The key here is whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the public phone booth.

Wait, I think the Supreme Court has addressed this. In the case of Katz v. United States, the Court ruled that the government's use of a wiretap on a public phone booth constituted a search under the Fourth Amendment because Katz had a reasonable expectation of privacy when making his calls. So, the police would need a warrant to tap that phone booth.

In this problem, the police didn't get a warrant. They acted based on a reliable informant. But even if the informant was reliable, and they had probable cause, without a warrant, the evidence might be excluded. Unless an exception applies.

Wait, but the phone is a public booth, right? So, is there an expectation of privacy there? Wait, Katz said yes, there is an expectation. So the police should have gotten a warrant. Without it, the evidence is inadmissible unless another exception applies.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Granted, because police should have obtained a court order before recording. This seems correct because under Katz, a warrant is needed.

Option B: Denied, because probable cause existed. But probable cause alone isn't enough without a warrant, unless an exception applies.

Option C: Denied, because no reasonable expectation of privacy. But Katz says there is, so this is incorrect.

Option D: Granted, because police didn't inform defendant. Not sure if informing is the issue; the main issue is the warrantless tap.

Option E: Denied, because informant was reliable. Again, reliability might give probable cause but without a warrant, it's still problematic.

Option F: Granted, because no prior approval from phone company. I'm not sure if that's a requirement. Maybe not the main issue.

Option G: Denied, because serious crime. The seriousness might affect the warrant process, but without a warrant, it's still an issue.

Option H: Granted, because no warrant. This aligns with Katz; without a warrant, the evidence is inadmissible.

Option I: Granted, because defendant wasn't aware. Awareness isn't the main issue, it's the expectation of privacy.

Option J: Denied, because public place. But Katz says even public phone booths have an expectation of privacy.

So, the correct answer would be either A or H because both mention the lack of a warrant. Wait, option A says "court order" and H says "warrant." They're similar, but in Katz, the court held that a warrant is required, so H seems more precise. Alternatively, maybe A and H are the same in this context.

Wait, looking back, the police installed the device without a warrant. So the evidence should be excluded because they needed a warrant. So the motion to suppress should be granted.

Options A and H both suggest the police should have obtained a warrant or court order. So which one is correct?

The question is about the defense motion to exclude the evidence. The motion should be granted because the police didn't get a warrant, violating the Fourth Amendment. So options A and H both seem to relate to this. But looking at the options:

Option A says the police should have obtained a court order before recording. Option H says the police didn't secure a warrant before installing the device.

In Katz, the court held that a warrant was required. So H would be the correct reason, making the motion granted because no warrant.

Wait, but could there be any exceptions? Like, if the police had exigent circumstances, they might not need a warrant. But the question doesn't mention any such circumstances. They just relied on the informant's tip. So no, they needed a warrant.

Therefore, the correct answer is H: granted, because the police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device.

Wait, but looking at option J and C, they argue about expectation of privacy. But Katz clearly said there's an expectation, so those options are incorrect.

So the defense motion should be granted because the evidence was obtained without a warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment. So the answer is H or A. Wait, the options are A and H.

Option A says the police should have obtained a court order. A court order is a warrant, so it's the same as H. So both A and H are about the lack of a warrant.

Wait, but which option is more accurate? Because in Katz, the issue was the warrantless wiretap, so the correct reason is that a warrant was required.

So the options are A and H. Let me look again.

Option A: granted because police should have obtained a court order before recording.

Option H: granted because police did not secure a warrant before installing the device.

These are essentially the same points. But in Katz, the court required a warrant, so H is the more precise reason. So I think the correct answer is H.

Wait, but let me think again. The police didn't just record; they installed a device without a warrant. So H is the reason.

Therefore, the motion should be granted, and the correct answer is H.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence obtained through a warrantless eavesdropping device installed by the police on a public phone booth. The defendant’s attorney moves to exclude the taped conversation, arguing that the police violated the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights by not obtaining a warrant. The key issue is whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the public phone booth and whether the police were required to secure a warrant.

Under the Supreme Court’s decision in **Katz v. United States**, the government’s use of a wiretap on a public phone booth constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment because individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy when making phone calls. Therefore, the police generally need a warrant to install such a device, unless an exception applies. In this case, the police did not obtain a warrant, and no exigent circumstances were present to justify the warrantless installation.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correctly states that the police should have obtained a court order (warrant) before recording the conversation. This aligns with the requirement under **Katz**.
- **Option H**: Specifically highlights that the police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device, which directly addresses the violation of the Fourth Amendment as established in **Katz**.

Both A and H are valid, but H is more precise because it explicitly focuses on the lack of a warrant, which is the central issue in this case. Therefore, the defense motion to exclude the evidence should be granted because the police did not secure a warrant before installing the eavesdropping device.

**Answer: H**
