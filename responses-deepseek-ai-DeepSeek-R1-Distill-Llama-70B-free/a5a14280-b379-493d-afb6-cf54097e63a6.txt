Okay, so I've got this question about the difference between Gross National Product (GNP) and National Income (NI). Hmm, I remember from my economics class that these terms are related but not exactly the same. Let me think.

I think GNP refers to the total value of all goods and services produced by a country's residents, whether they're within the country or abroad. So it's like the overall production, including everything the country's people make, both at home and internationally. On the other hand, National Income might be more about the income earned by the people within the country, not necessarily including income from outside.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definitions. Let me try to break it down. GNP is often calculated as the sum of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. Or is that GDP? Oh wait, GNP is similar but includes income from abroad. Because I remember that GDP is within the borders, while GNP includes the income from citizens working overseas.

So GNP is the market value of all final goods and services produced by the country's residents, regardless of where they are produced. National Income, I think, is the total income earned by those residents, which includes things like wages, profits, rents, but it's the sum of all those incomes.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: GNP is total income of the nation, NI is total income by individuals. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. GNP is more about production value, not just income.

Option B: GNP is goods/services produced in a year, NI is total income earned after deductions. Maybe. So NI would exclude indirect taxes, depreciation, etc. I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Option C: GNP includes only within borders, NI includes abroad. Wait, no, I thought GNP includes income from abroad, while GDP is within. So this would be the opposite. So C is incorrect.

Option D: GNP is finished products, NI raw materials. That doesn't seem right. Both would include various stages, I think.

Option E: GNP from domestic and foreign, NI only foreign. No, that's the opposite. GNP includes both, so NI can't be only foreign. Doesn't make sense.

Option F: GNP is final goods/services by residents, NI is sum of wages, profits, rents. This sounds familiar. Because GNP is about production, NI is about the income earned by the residents. So F could be correct.

Option G: GNP measures output, NI measures input. Not sure. I think both are output measures in a way, but maybe NI is more about income distribution.

Option H: GNP is government spending, NI consumer. No, that's not right. GNP includes all spending, not just government.

Option I: GNP is corporations, NI is citizens. No, that doesn't fit. Both include all residents.

Option J: GNP is exports, NI imports. No, that's not it.

So narrowing down, the correct answer seems to be option F. Because GNP is the value of production by residents, and NI is the sum of their incomes from various sources like wages, profits, etc.

The correct answer is:

F: GNP is the market value of all final goods and services produced by a country's residents, while NI is the sum of all wages, profits, and rents earned by a country's residents.
