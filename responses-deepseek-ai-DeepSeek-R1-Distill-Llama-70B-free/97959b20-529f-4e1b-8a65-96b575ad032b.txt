Okay, so I've got this problem here where a point (x, y) is randomly picked from inside a rectangle with vertices at (0,0), (3,0), (3,2), and (0,2). I need to find the probability that x < y. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.

First, I remember that probability in such cases is usually the area where the condition is satisfied divided by the total area of the rectangle. So I should find the area where x < y and then divide that by the area of the rectangle.

Let's start by calculating the area of the rectangle. The length along the x-axis is from 0 to 3, so that's 3 units. The height along the y-axis is from 0 to 2, so 2 units. Area is length times height, so 3 * 2 = 6. So the total area is 6.

Now, the tricky part is finding the area where x < y. Since both x and y are coordinates in the rectangle, I should visualize this. The rectangle spans from x=0 to x=3 and y=0 to y=2.

I think it would help to sketch the region where x < y. Wait, but x can go up to 3 and y only up to 2. So for some x values, y can't be larger than 2, but x can be larger than y. Let me think about the possible regions.

The condition x < y implies that for a given x, y has to be greater than x. But y can't exceed 2. So for x values less than 2, y can be from x up to 2. But for x values from 2 to 3, y can't be greater than x because y's maximum is 2, and x is already greater than that. So in that region (x >=2), there's no y that satisfies x < y.

So the area where x < y exists only where x is between 0 and 2. Let's break it down:

For x from 0 to 2, y ranges from x to 2. So the area would be the integral from x=0 to x=2 of (2 - x) dx.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the rectangle goes up to x=3, but y stops at 2. So maybe I should also consider y as a variable and see where x < y.

Alternatively, think about the line x = y. Since y can only go up to 2, the line x=y will intersect the rectangle at (0,0) and (2,2). Beyond x=2, the line x=y would go beyond the rectangle's top.

So the region where x < y in the rectangle is the area above the line y = x, but only up to y=2. So this area would be a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (2,2), and (0,2). Because above the line y=x, from x=0 to x=2, y ranges from x to 2.

So let's calculate the area of this triangle. The base is from (0,0) to (2,2), which is along y=x. Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of it as a right triangle with legs of length 2. The area would be (1/2)*base*height. So (1/2)*2*2 = 2.

Wait, but wait again. Because the region is bounded by x from 0 to 2 and y from x to 2. So the area is the integral from x=0 to x=2 of (2 - x) dx.

Calculating that integral:

The integral of (2 - x) dx from 0 to 2 is [2x - (x^2)/2] evaluated from 0 to 2.

At x=2: 2*(2) - (2^2)/2 = 4 - 2 = 2.

At x=0: 0 - 0 = 0.

So the area is 2 - 0 = 2.

So the area where x < y is 2, and the total area is 6. So the probability is 2/6 = 1/3.

Wait, but let me double-check. The area where x < y is a triangle with base 2 and height 2, so area is (1/2)*2*2=2. So yes, 2/6 is 1/3.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because the rectangle's y only goes up to 2, but x goes up to 3. So the region where x < y can only exist where x is less than 2 because y can't be larger than 2. So for x from 0 to 2, y can be from x to 2, which gives a triangle. For x from 2 to 3, y can't be larger than x, so the area is zero there.

Therefore, the area satisfying x < y is indeed 2, total area is 6, so probability is 2/6 = 1/3.

Looking at the options, option F is 1/3.

To determine the probability that \( x < y \) for a point \((x, y)\) randomly picked from inside the rectangle with vertices \((0,0)\), \((3,0)\), \((3,2)\), and \((0,2)\), we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total area of the rectangle**:  
   The rectangle has a length of 3 (along the x-axis) and a height of 2 (along the y-axis).  
   \[
   \text{Total Area} = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

2. **Identify the region where \( x < y \)**:  
   The condition \( x < y \) implies that for a given \( x \), \( y \) must be greater than \( x \). However, since \( y \) is bounded by 2, this condition can only be satisfied when \( x \) is between 0 and 2. For \( x \geq 2 \), \( y \) cannot exceed 2, so \( x < y \) is impossible in that range.

   Thus, the region where \( x < y \) is a triangle with vertices at \((0,0)\), \((2,2)\), and \((0,2)\). This triangle lies above the line \( y = x \) but within the rectangle.

3. **Calculate the area of the region where \( x < y \)**:  
   The region is a right triangle with legs of length 2. The area of a triangle is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 = 2
   \]

4. **Compute the probability**:  
   The probability is the ratio of the area where \( x < y \) to the total area of the rectangle:  
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area where } x < y}{\text{Total Area}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

5. **Match with the options**:  
   The probability \( \frac{1}{3} \) corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
