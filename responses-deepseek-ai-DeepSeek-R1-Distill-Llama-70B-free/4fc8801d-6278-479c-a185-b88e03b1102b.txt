Question:

A resident in an exclusive residential area is a marine biologist. To aid in his study of sharks, he had a large tank built in his backyard in which he placed a great white shark. Aside from a smell that emanated from the tank, some neighbors were concerned and afraid to let their children outside for fear that they would wander onto the resident's property. In order to convince his neighbors that they had nothing to fear, the resident invited them over to view the shark tank. While a neighbor was standing near the tank, the shark splashed its tail, and the neighbor got very wet. The neighbor, who had a cold, developed bronchitis. If the neighbor sues the resident for damages incurred from being drenched by the shark and bases her suit on strict liability, she will most likely

Options:

A: not recover, because she suffered injury only because she had a cold and, therefore, was unusually vulnerable to harm from being splashed with water.
B: not recover, because the resident had taken all necessary precautions to ensure the shark could not harm anyone.
C: recover, because the resident intentionally placed the shark in an area where it could potentially harm others.
D: not recover, because the development of bronchitis was not a direct result of the resident's actions.
E: recover, because the possessor of wild animals is strictly liable for all injuries caused to others by the animals.
F: not recover, because she willingly chose to visit the resident's property and view the shark tank.
G: not recover, because she did not suffer the type of harm normally inflicted by a shark.
H: recover, because the smell from the shark tank was a nuisance.
I: recover, because the resident knowingly kept a dangerous wild animal in a residential area.
J: recover, because the resident failed to warn her of the potential risk of being splashed by the shark.

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about tort law, specifically strict liability. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a marine biologist has a great white shark in a tank in his backyard. Some neighbors are worried, so he invites them over to show them the shark tank. While a neighbor is near the tank, the shark splashes its tail, getting her very wet. She had a cold and then developed bronchitis. Now she's suing under strict liability.

Hmm, strict liability usually applies in certain situations. I remember that one of them is when someone keeps a wild animal or an abnormally dangerous animal. The idea is that even if the person took precautions, they can be held liable for any harm caused by the animal because of its dangerous nature.

So the question is, does a great white shark qualify as a wild or abnormally dangerous animal? I think sharks, especially great whites, are considered wild animals, not domesticated. So under the theory of strict liability, the possessor of such an animal could be held liable for any injuries it causes, regardless of negligence.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the possessor of wild animals is strictly liable for all injuries caused by the animals. That sounds right, but wait, the shark was in a tank. Does that change anything? Well, the strict liability applies because the animal's natural behavior can cause harm, even if it's contained. So if the shark acts in a way typical for it, like splashing, which is a natural behavior, then the liability might hold.

But wait, the injury here isn't from a shark attack. She got wet, which led to bronchitis because she had a cold. So the harm isn't the usual kind we expect from a shark. Does that matter? I think for strict liability, it's about the kind of harm that makes the animal dangerous. So maybe the court would consider if the harm was foreseeable as part of the animal's dangerous nature.

Other options: Option G says she didn't suffer the type of harm normally inflicted by a shark. That's true because she wasn't bitten. But I'm not sure if that matters. Strict liability might still apply if the animal's action, even if not the typical attack, causes harm. For example, if a wild animal causes property damage, that's covered too.

Option I says the resident knowingly kept a dangerous wild animal in a residential area. That's another angle. Keeping such an animal could be considered abnormally dangerous, so strict liability applies.

Option J talks about failure to warn. But strict liability doesn't require that; it's more about the nature of the animal, not about warnings.

So between E and I. Wait, E says "wild animals" and I says "dangerous wild animal." Sharks are both wild and dangerous. So both could apply, but E is more specific about the category. I think the key here is that strict liability applies to the keeping of dangerous animals as a category.

Wait, but the shark was in a tank. If the tank was secure, maybe the resident took precautions. But strict liability doesn't depend on negligence; it's about the nature of the animal. So even if the resident was careful, he might still be liable because the shark is a wild animal.

So looking back, the neighbor got wet because the shark splashed. That's an action of the shark. So under E, the resident is strictly liable for any injury caused by the wild animal. Even if the injury is getting wet and catching bronchitis, that's a direct result of the shark's action.

Alternatively, option G suggests that because it's not the usual harm, she can't recover. But I think that's not correct because strict liability isn't limited to the typical injuries. It's about the fact that the animal's behavior, even if not attacking, caused harm.

So the correct answer might be E or I. Wait, E says "all injuries caused by the animals." Does that apply here? The shark's splash caused the wetness, leading to bronchitis. So yes, it's an injury caused by the animal.

Therefore, the answer is E: recover because the possessor of wild animals is strictly liable for all injuries caused by the animals.

Wait, but another point: the shark was in a tank, so maybe it's considered in captivity. Does that affect the strict liability? I think the rule applies to wild animals regardless of whether they're confined. So even in a tank, the strict liability would apply.

So the answer is E.

The question revolves around strict liability in tort law, specifically whether the resident can be held liable for injuries caused by a great white shark in his backyard tank. Strict liability applies to the possession of wild or abnormally dangerous animals, regardless of negligence, because their natural behaviors can cause harm. Great white sharks are considered wild and dangerous animals, so the resident could be held strictly liable for any harm caused by the shark, even if it is in a tank.

In this case, the shark's splashing caused the neighbor to get wet, leading to bronchitis. While the harm was not the typical injury expected from a shark (e.g., a bite), strict liability applies to any injury caused by the animal's natural behavior. The fact that the shark was in a tank does not negate strict liability, as the rule applies to wild animals regardless of confinement.

Analyzing the options:

- **E** correctly states that the possessor of wild animals is strictly liable for all injuries caused by the animals. This aligns with the principle of strict liability for wild animals, as the shark's natural behavior (splashing) caused the injury.
- **G** is incorrect because strict liability is not limited to the "type of harm normally inflicted" by the animal. It applies to any harm caused by the animal's natural behavior.
- Other options, such as **I** and **J**, focus on different aspects (e.g., knowingly keeping a dangerous animal or failure to warn) but are less directly relevant to the strict liability doctrine.

Thus, the correct answer is **E**, as the resident, as the possessor of a wild animal, is strictly liable for the injury caused by the shark.

**Answer: E**
