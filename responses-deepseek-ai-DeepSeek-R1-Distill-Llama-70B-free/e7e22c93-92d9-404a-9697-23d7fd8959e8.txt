Okay, so I've got this question about how interest rates affect a country's currency value. Hmm, let me think. I remember that interest rates play a role in exchange rates, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The question says that if interest rates rise more in Country A compared to Country B, what happens to Country A's currency value. The options are A through J, with E being depreciate and C being appreciate.

Wait, I think it's about the concept of interest rate differentials and how they influence currency. So when a country's interest rates go up, it might make that country's currency stronger because higher interest rates attract foreign investment. Investors would want to put their money where they can get higher returns, right?

So if Country A raises its rates more than Country B, investors might move their money into Country A's assets. This increased demand for Country A's currency would cause it to appreciate. So the value of Country A's currency should go up, meaning it appreciates.

Looking at the options, option C is "appreciate." Option E is "depreciate," which would be the opposite. So the correct answer should be C.

When interest rates rise more in Country A than in Country B, investors are attracted to the higher returns in Country A. This increased demand for Country A's currency causes its value to appreciate.

The answer is C.
