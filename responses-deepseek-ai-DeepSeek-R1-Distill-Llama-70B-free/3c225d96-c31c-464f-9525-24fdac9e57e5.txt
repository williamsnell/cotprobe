Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about field theory. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question presents two statements and asks whether each is true or false. Let's look at each statement one by one.

Statement 1 says, "R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q." Alright, I remember that a splitting field is a field extension where a polynomial factors into linear factors. So, for R (the real numbers) to be a splitting field over Q (the rationals), there must be some polynomial with rational coefficients that splits into linear factors in R.

Wait, but the real numbers are a field, and they're the splitting field for certain polynomials. For example, consider the polynomial x² + 1. This polynomial doesn't split over Q because it doesn't have real roots, but wait, does it split over R? No, because x² + 1 factors into (x - i)(x + i), which are complex, not real. So that's not the one.

Wait, maybe another polynomial. Let me think. How about x² - 2? That splits into (x - sqrt(2))(x + sqrt(2)) over R, right? But wait, sqrt(2) is in R. So the splitting field of x² - 2 over Q is Q(sqrt(2)), which is a subfield of R. But R itself is a larger field. So is R the splitting field of a larger polynomial?

Wait, another thought: maybe the polynomial that has all roots in R. Like a polynomial with all real roots. For example, (x - 1)(x - 2)...(x - n). But that's trivial because the splitting field would just be Q itself if all roots are rational, but more likely, it's a bigger extension.

Wait, I think that R is actually the splitting field of the polynomial x² - a for some a in Q. Wait, but R isn't just a quadratic extension. Oh wait, no. Because R is uncountable, and a splitting field over Q must be a countable extension if it's generated by a single polynomial, right? Because each polynomial has a finite degree, and Q is countable. So the splitting field, being a countable extension, but R is uncountable. So R can't be a splitting field of any single polynomial over Q because it's uncountable. So statement 1 must be false.

Wait, but wait another point. Is the real numbers a splitting field of some polynomial over Q? Or is it that R is algebraically closed? No, R isn't algebraically closed because, for example, x² +1 doesn't split in R. So R isn't algebraically closed, but it is a field where some polynomials split. But for R to be a splitting field, there must exist some polynomial over Q that has all its roots in R, and R is generated by adding those roots.

But wait, another angle: the real numbers are a union of fields generated by adding roots of polynomials. But a splitting field is a finite extension, right? Because any polynomial has a finite number of roots, so the splitting field is a finite extension. But R isn't a finite extension of Q; it's an infinite-dimensional vector space over Q. So R can't be a splitting field of any finite-degree polynomial over Q. Therefore, statement 1 is false.

Now, moving on to statement 2: "There is a field with 60 elements." Hmm. I remember that finite fields, also called Galois fields, have orders that are powers of prime numbers. So the number of elements must be a prime power, like p^n where p is prime and n is a positive integer.

So, is 60 a prime power? Let's factorize 60: 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5. So it's not a prime power because it's the product of different primes. Therefore, there's no field with 60 elements. So statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait another point. Let me make sure. Are there any fields of composite order that are not prime powers? I don't think so. Because the existence of a finite field of order q requires that q is a prime power. So, since 60 isn't a prime power, there's no field of 60 elements. So statement 2 is false.

Wait, but perhaps I'm confusing something. Wait, another thought: sometimes people talk about rings with zero divisors having composite orders, but those aren't fields. So in the context of fields, the order must be a prime power. So statement 2 is false.

So, putting it all together. Statement 1 is false because R is not a splitting field of any polynomial over Q (as R is uncountable, and splitting fields over Q of finite degree are countable). Statement 2 is false because 60 isn't a prime power, so no field exists with 60 elements.

Looking back at the options:

Option H is False, False. So the correct choice would be H.
</think>

Statement 1: "R is a splitting field of some polynomial over Q."  
To determine if this is true, we recall that a splitting field is a field extension where a polynomial factors into linear factors. For R (the real numbers) to be a splitting field over Q (the rationals), there must exist a polynomial with rational coefficients that splits into linear factors in R. However, R is uncountable, while any splitting field of a polynomial over Q must be countable because Q is countable and polynomials have finite degree. Since R is uncountable, it cannot be the splitting field of any single polynomial over Q. Therefore, **Statement 1 is false**.

Statement 2: "There is a field with 60 elements."  
Finite fields (Galois fields) have orders that are prime powers, i.e., of the form \( p^n \), where \( p \) is a prime and \( n \) is a positive integer. The number 60 factors as \( 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \), which is not a prime power. Since 60 is not a prime power, there is no field with 60 elements. Therefore, **Statement 2 is false**.

Given that both statements are false, the correct answer is:

**H: False, False**
