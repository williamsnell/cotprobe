Okay, so I have this question about the maximum height water can be raised by a vacuum at sea level when the water is at 150°F. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that the height to which a liquid can be lifted by a vacuum is determined by the vapor pressure of the liquid. Because in a vacuum pump, the maximum suction is limited by the point where the liquid starts to vaporize (or boil) under reduced pressure. So, if the water's vapor pressure equals the surrounding pressure, it can't be lifted any higher than that point.

Wait, right, the formula I think is related to the barometric pressure and the vapor pressure. The maximum height is when the vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. Oh wait, no, actually, the height is determined by the difference between atmospheric pressure and the vapor pressure. Because the atmospheric pressure pushes the water up until the vapor pressure inside the water equals the atmospheric pressure.

So the formula for the maximum height (h) is h = (P_atm - P_vapor) * (1 / (density * g)), where g is the acceleration due to gravity.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me get it straight. The hydrostatic pressure at height h is P = density * g * h. At the maximum height, this pressure equals the atmospheric pressure minus the vapor pressure. Because the pressure at the top of the column is the vapor pressure, and atmospheric pressure is pushing it up.

So, rearranging, h = (P_atm - P_vapor) / (density * g).

Yes, that makes sense. So I need to find the vapor pressure of water at 150°F (which is 65.56°C, since 150-32=118, 118*5/9≈65.56). Then, using that, calculate h.

I think I can look up the vapor pressure of water at 65.56°C. Alternatively, perhaps I remember that at 60°C, the vapor pressure is about 149.2 mmHg, and at 70°C, it's about 233.7 mmHg. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact values, but maybe I can use an approximation or find a table.

Wait, another approach: maybe using the Antoine equation to approximate the vapor pressure. The Antoine equation is log10(P) = A - B/(T + C), where T is in °C, and P is in mmHg. For water, the constants are A=8.14019, B=1810.94, C=244.485. So that's the equation I can use.

So T is 65.56°C. Plugging into the equation:

log10(P) = 8.14019 - 1810.94/(65.56 + 244.485)
Let me calculate the denominator first: 65.56 + 244.485 = 310.045.

So 1810.94 / 310.045 ≈ 5.84.

So 8.14019 - 5.84 = 2.30019.

So P = 10^2.30019 ≈ 200 mmHg? Wait, 10^2.3 is about 200 because 10^2 is 100, 10^0.3 is about 2, so 100 *2=200. So approximately 200 mmHg? But wait, let me check with actual data because I might be making a mistake.

Wait, another way: I remember that at 100°C, vapor pressure is 760 mmHg (standard atmospheric pressure). So at 65°C, it's lower than 760, perhaps around 250 mmHg? Wait, no, when I think about it, at 60°C, the vapor pressure is about 149.2 mmHg, and at 70°C, 233.7 mmHg. Wait, wait, wait, that can't be right because 70°C can't have higher vapor pressure than 60°C. Wait, no, wait, I'm getting confused. Higher temperature should have higher vapor pressure. So actually, at 60°C, it's 149.2 mmHg, at 70°C, 312.8 mmHg. Oh wait, no, that doesn't seem right either. Because at 100°C, it's 760 mmHg, so between 60 and 100, it's increasing.

Wait, perhaps I should look up a vapor pressure table for water. Alternatively, perhaps I can make a linear approximation. Let's see, the precise calculation might be better.

Wait, using the Antoine equation again. Let me compute it more accurately.

T = 65.56°C.

Antoine equation: log10(P) = 8.14019 - (1810.94)/(65.56 + 244.485).

Compute denominator: 65.56 + 244.485 = 310.045.

So 1810.94 / 310.045 ≈ let's compute 310.045 * 5.84 = 1810.93, which is very close to 1810.94. So 1810.94 / 310.045 ≈ 5.84.

So 8.14019 -5.84 = 2.30019.

So P = 10^2.30019.

What's 10^2.3? Let's compute. 10^2 =100, 10^0.3 is about 2 (since 10^0.3010=2). So 100 * 2 = 200 mmHg. So P ≈ 200 mmHg.

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me check with actual data. Let me think, at 60°C, the vapor pressure is 149.2 mmHg. At 70°C, it's about 312.8 mmHg. So at 65.56°C, it's somewhere between 149.2 and 312.8. Wait, 200 mmHg would be between 60 and 70°C, which makes sense.

Wait, but if I use the Antoine equation, I get approximately 200 mmHg. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use a different approach, like using the boiling point. Wait, no, because the boiling point is 212°F at sea level, which is higher than 150°F. So at 150°F, the vapor pressure is less than atmospheric pressure.

So, atmospheric pressure at sea level is 14.7 psi, or in mmHg, it's 760 mmHg. So P_vapor is 200 mmHg, then P_atm - P_vapor is 760 - 200 = 560 mmHg.

Wait, wait, no: the maximum height is when the vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure minus the pressure from the column of water. Or wait, the pressure at the top of the column is the vapor pressure. So the pressure difference that supports the column is (atmospheric pressure) - (vapor pressure). So that pressure difference times the area is the weight of the column, which is density * g * h * area.

So (P_atm - P_vapor) = density * g * h.

So h = (P_atm - P_vapor) / (density * g).

I need to make sure all the units are compatible. Let's convert everything to consistent units.

P_atm is 760 mmHg. P_vapor is 200 mmHg. So their difference is 560 mmHg. But I need to convert this to units of pressure that can be used with density in lb/ft³ or something.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to convert mmHg to psi. Because 760 mmHg is 14.7 psi. So 1 mmHg is 14.7 /760 psi ≈ 0.0193368 psi.

So P_atm = 760 mmHg =14.7 psi.

P_vapor = 200 mmHg. So 200 mmHg * (14.7 psi /760 mmHg) = (200 *14.7)/760 psi.

200 *14.7 = 2940. Divide by 760: 2940 /760 ≈ 3.868 psi.

So P_atm - P_vapor =14.7 -3.868 ≈10.832 psi.

Now, the density of water is about 62.4 lb/ft³.

g is 32.2 ft/s².

So h = (10.832 psi) / (62.4 lb/ft³ * 32.2 ft/s²).

Wait, but the units need to work out. Let me think: psi is lb per square inch. So 1 psi =1 lb/in².

So 1 lb/in² = 1 lb/(1/144 ft²) )= 144 lb/ft².

So 10.832 psi =10.832 lb/in² * 144 lb/ft² per psi = 1560 lb/ft².

Wait, wait, no, actually, to convert psi to lb/ft², it's 144 lb/ft² per psi. So 10.832 psi * 144 lb/ft² per psi = 1560 lb/ft².

So P = 1560 lb/ft².

Now, the equation is P = density * g * h.

So h = P/(density * g) = 1560 / (62.4 *32.2).

Compute the denominator: 62.4 *32.2 ≈ 62.4 *30=1872, 62.4*2.2=137.28, total about 2009.28.

So h≈1560 /2009.28 ≈0.776 feet. Wait, that can't be right because the options are all way higher. Hmm, did I make a mistake in the units somewhere?

Wait, maybe I messed up the conversion. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I should have kept everything in mmHg and converted to feet of water. Because I remember that 1 atmosphere can support about 33.9 feet of water at 4°C.

But in this case, the temperature is higher, so the density is slightly less, but more importantly, the vapor pressure reduces the effective pressure.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the formula for the height is (P_atm - P_vapor) / (density * g), but perhaps using units where pressure is in feet of water.

Wait, the atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 33.9 feet of water (since 14.7 psi * 2.31 ft/psi ≈34 ft). Wait, yes, 1 psi is about 2.31 ft of water, so 14.7 psi *2.31 ≈34 ft.

So P_atm is 34 ft of water.

P_vapor is the vapor pressure expressed in feet of water. So I need to find what 200 mmHg is in feet of water.

But how to convert mmHg to feet of water. Let's see.

I know that 1 mmHg is about 0.535 ft of water. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 1 atm is 760 mmHg, which is 34 ft of water. So 760 mmHg =34 ft.

So 1 mmHg =34 ft /760 ≈0.0447 ft, which is about 0.536 inches. So 200 mmHg is 200 *0.0447 ≈8.94 ft.

So P_vapor is 8.94 ft of water.

So the pressure difference is 34 ft -8.94 ft ≈25.06 ft of water.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the height can't be 25 ft if the pressure difference is 25 ft. Wait, no, the height h would then be the pressure difference divided by the density, but wait, the pressure difference is already in terms of feet of water. So h would be (P_atm - P_vapor) in feet of water.

Wait, no, no. Wait, if P_atm is 34 ft of water, and P_vapor is 8.94 ft of water, then the maximum height the water can be lifted is when the pressure from the water column equals P_atm - P_vapor.

So h = (P_atm - P_vapor) / (density * g) ?

Wait, no, because P_atm - P_vapor is the pressure difference that can support the column. So h is (P_atm - P_vapor)/(density * g), but when P is expressed in the same units as density and g.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of h = (P_atm - P_vapor) / (density * g), with P in psf (pounds per square foot), density in slugs per cubic foot, and g in ft/s².

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, since I know that 1 atmosphere can support about 34 ft of water at 4°C, and at higher temperatures, water is less dense, so the height would be higher. So perhaps I can calculate the correction due to temperature.

Wait, but in the previous approach, with P_vapor in ft of water being about 8.94 ft, then the available pressure is 34 - 8.94=25.06 ft. But that would imply that h is 25 ft. Looking at the options, option J is 26.03, which is close. But I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I got the vapor pressure calculation wrong. Let me double-check the Antoine equation.

Wait, Antoine equation for water is log10(P_mmHg) = 8.14019 - (1810.94)/(T_C +244.485).

At T=65.56°C,

log10(P) = 8.14019 - (1810.94)/(65.56 +244.485)
Denominator: 65.56 +244.485=310.045

1810.94 /310.045≈5.84.

So 8.14019 -5.84=2.30019.

So P=10^2.30019≈200 mmHg.

Yes, that's correct. So P_vapor=200 mmHg.

Now, converting 200 mmHg to feet of water.

As 760 mmHg = 34 ft,

200 mmHg = (200/760)*34 ≈(0.26316)*34≈8.947 ft.

So P_available =34 -8.947≈25.053 ft.

But then, the height h would be determined by the density. Because the density of water at 150°F is lower than at 4°C.

Wait, right! Because the density of water decreases with temperature. So at higher temperatures, water is less dense, so the same pressure can support a taller column.

So at 4°C, 1 atm supports 34 ft. So at a higher temp, the same pressure would support more ft because density is lower.

So I need to adjust for the density change.

The density of water at 150°F. Let me think. At 60°C (140°F), the density is about 0.98 g/cm³. Wait, no, 60°C is about 0.98. Wait, no, wait, maximum density is at 4°C (1 g/cm³). At higher temps, it decreases.

Wait, 150°F is 65.56°C.

The density of water at 65.56°C: I think it's about 0.979 g/cm³. So 0.979 * 1000 kg/m³= 979 kg/m³. But to convert to lb/ft³, since 1 lb/ft³ is about 16.018 kg/m³.

Wait, wait, 1 lb/ft³ ≈ 16.018 kg/m³. So 979 kg/m³ is 979 /16.018 ≈61.14 lb/ft³.

Wait, at 4°C, density is about 62.4 lb/ft³. So at 65.56°C, it's 61.14 lb/ft³.

So the density is lower, meaning the height will be higher than what it would be at 4°C.

So, the formula is h = (P_atm - P_vapor) / (density * g).

But wait, I'm getting confused with the units again. Alternatively, since at 4°C, the height is 34 ft when P_vapor is 0 (i.e., in a perfect vacuum), but when P_vapor is present, the height is (P_atm - P_vapor)/(density *g).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the height using the relative density.

At 4°C, 1 atm supports 34 ft.

If the density at T is lower, then the height would be higher by the ratio of densities.

So, let me compute the density ratio.

Density at T=65.56°C: 61.14 lb/ft³.

Density at 4°C:62.4 lb/ft³.

Ratio =62.4 /61.14≈1.021.

So the height would be 34 ft * ratio =34 *1.021≈34.71 ft.

But wait, that's when the vapor pressure is zero. In our case, the vapor pressure is 200 mmHg, which reduces the available pressure.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the available pressure being (P_atm - P_vapor), so the height is (P_atm - P_vapor)/(density *g).

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 1 psi supports 2.31 ft of water at 4°C.

But when the temperature is higher, each psi supports more ft because the density is lower.

So, the available pressure is 14.7 psi -3.868 psi≈10.832 psi.

At 4°C, 10.832 psi *2.31 ft/psi≈25.03 ft.

But at 65.56°C, since the density is lower, the height will be higher.

So, the height h =25.03 ft * (density at 4°C / density at T).

Which is 25.03 * (62.4 /61.14) ≈25.03 *1.021≈25.56 ft.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one would be option J:26.03 ft. But let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

I think I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me try to compute it step by step correctly.

First, find the vapor pressure at 150°F (65.56°C) using the Antoine equation.

Antoine equation: log10(P) =8.14019 - (1810.94)/(T +244.485).

T=65.56°C.

So,

Denominator =65.56 +244.485=310.045.

1810.94 /310.045≈5.840.

So,

log10(P)=8.14019 -5.840
