Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that one mole of an ideal gas is expanded adiabatically and reversibly from 20 atm to 1 atm. The initial temperature is 300 K. I need to find the final temperature, and they give me that Cv is (3/2)R per mole. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, adiabatic processes mean no heat is exchanged with the surroundings (Q=0). For such processes, I remember that the first law of thermodynamics tells us that the change in internal energy (ΔU) equals the work done on the system. But wait, in expansion, the system does work on the surroundings, so ΔU would be negative, right?

Since it's a reversible adiabatic expansion, I think the formula that relates temperatures and volumes (or pressures) should apply. The formula I'm trying to recall is something like T V^(γ-1) = constant or T P^( (1-γ)/γ ) = constant. Oh wait, right, for an adiabatic process, the relation between temperature and pressure is T1 * P1^((1-γ)/γ) = T2 * P2^((1-γ)/γ).

Wait, but maybe it's better to think in terms of the relation involving the number of moles, which isn't changing here since it's one mole. Hmm. Alternatively, the formula could be written as (T2)/(T1) = (P2/P1)^( (γ-1)/γ ) ), or maybe (P2/P1)^(γ/(γ-1)) ), I need to get that right.

Wait, let me think about the adiabatic condition. The general formula is TV^(γ-1) = constant. But since it's a gas expanding, the volume increases. Alternatively, since PV^γ = constant for adiabatic processes.

Alternatively, I remember that for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible adiabatic process, the relation between T and P is T1^(γ) * P1^(1-γ) = T2^(γ) * P2^(1-γ). Wait, maybe another approach.

Wait, let me get the correct formula. The relation between T and P for an adiabatic process is given by:

T^(γ) * P^(1-γ) = constant.

Alternatively, I might have mixed up the exponents. Let me think again: the formula is TV^(γ-1) = constant. But since PV = nRT, I can express V in terms of P and T.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express V in terms of T and P. Let me write down the ideal gas law: PV = nRT. So V = nRT/P.

Substituting V into the adiabatic equation: T [ (nRT/P) ]^(γ-1) = constant. Since n is constant (1 mole), we can write:

T * (RT/P)^(γ-1) = constant.

But since it's a process, the initial and final states must satisfy the same expression. So:

T1 * (R T1 / P1 )^(γ-1) = T2 * (R T2 / P2 )^(γ-1)

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can simplify this expression. Let's take both sides and divide them:

(T1 / T2) = [ (R T2 / P2 ) / ( R T1 / P1 ) ) ]^(γ-1)

Wait, maybe I should take the ratio of the two states. Let me write the equation as:

(T1 / T2) = [ ( (R T2 / P2 ) ) / ( R T1 / P1 ) ) ]^(γ-1)

Simplify the fraction inside the brackets:

(R T2 / P2 ) / ( R T1 / P1 ) ) = (T2 P1)/(T1 P2)

So,

(T1 / T2) = [ (T2 P1 )/( T1 P2 ) ) ]^(γ-1)

Hmm, maybe taking both sides to the 1/(γ-1) power would help.

Alternatively, let me take logarithms to make this easier, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of the ratio of pressures.

Wait, maybe another approach. I remember that for an adiabatic process, the relation between temperatures and volumes is T1 V1^(γ-1) = T2 V2^(γ-1). But since PV = nRT, maybe I can relate the pressures and volumes.

Alternatively, using the relation between T and P in an adiabatic process. Let me think, for an ideal gas, the relation is:

(T2 / T1) = (P2 / P1)^( (γ-1)/γ )

Wait, is that right? Let me verify the derivation.

So, starting from the adiabatic condition: PV^γ = constant.

We also have PV = nRT, so V = nRT/P.

Substituting into PV^γ:

P (nRT/P)^γ = constant.

Simplify:

P * (n^γ R^γ T^γ) / P^γ = constant.

Which becomes:

n^γ R^γ T^γ / P^{γ-1} = constant.

Since n and R are constants, we can write:

T^γ / P^{γ-1} = constant.

So, (T1^γ)/(P1^{γ-1}) ) = (T2^γ)/(P2^{γ-1}) )

Taking both sides to the 1/γ power:

T1 / (P1^{(γ-1)/γ}) ) = T2 / (P2^{(γ-1)/γ}) )

Rearranging:

T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1 )^{(γ-1)/γ} }

Wait, because when you have T1 / (P1^{a}) = T2 / (P2^{a}), then T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^a, where a is (γ-1)/γ.

Wait, no, let me make sure. Let me write the equation again:

(T1^γ ) / (P1^{γ-1}) ) = (T2^γ ) / (P2^{γ-1}) )

Divide both sides by T1^γ and multiply both sides by P1^{γ-1}:

1 = (T2^γ / T1^γ ) * ( P1^{γ-1} / P2^{γ-1} )

So,

(T2 / T1 )^γ = (P1 / P2 )^{γ-1}

Taking both sides to the 1/γ power:

T2 / T1 = (P1 / P2 )^{ (γ-1)/γ }

So,

T2 = T1 * (P1 / P2 )^{ (γ-1)/γ }

Wait, that makes sense. Because when pressure decreases (P2 < P1), the temperature should also decrease, which is what we expect in an adiabatic expansion.

So, now I need to calculate gamma (γ), which is the heat capacity ratio Cp/Cv.

Given that Cv = (3/2) R per mole, which is typical for a monatomic ideal gas. So Cp = Cv + R = (5/2) R.

Thus, γ = Cp/Cv = (5/2 R) / (3/2 R) ) = 5/3 ≈ 1.6667.

So, γ = 5/3, (γ-1) = 2/3, and (γ-1)/γ = (2/3)/(5/3) )= 2/5.

So,

T2 = T1 * (P1 / P2 )^{ 2/5 }

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

T1 is given as 300 K.

P1 is 20 atm, P2 is 1 atm.

So P1/P2 = 20/1 = 20.

So,

T2 = 300 K * (20)^(2/5 )

Wait, what's 20 raised to the 2/5 power?

Hmm, 2/5 is 0.4, so I need to compute 20^0.4.

I think I'll compute this using logarithms or approximate it.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of exponents. 20 is 2*10, 10 is 10^1, 2 is 2^1.

But perhaps an easier way is to express 20 as 2^2 *5^1, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write 20^(2/5) = e^{(2/5) * ln(20)}.

Compute ln(20): ln(20)= ln(2*10)=ln(2)+ln(10)≈0.6931 + 2.3026≈2.9957.

So, (2/5)*ln(20)= (0.4)*2.9957≈1.1983.

So e^1.1983 ≈ e^1.2 is about 3.32 (since e^1=2.718, e^0.2≈1.2214, so 2.718*1.2214≈3.32).

So 20^(2/5) ≈3.32.

Wait, but let me confirm. Another way to compute 20^(0.4):

We can think of 20^0.4 = (20^(1/5))^2. The fifth root of 20 is approximately 1.82, because 1.82^5 ≈ 1.82*1.82=3.31, 3.31*1.82≈6.03, 6.03*1.82≈10.97, 10.97*1.82≈19.94. So the fifth root of 20 is approximately 1.82. So 20^(1/5)= ~1.82, then squared is (1.82)^2≈3.31.

So yes, 20^(2/5)= ~3.31.

So T2=300 K * 3.31 = ?

Wait 300 *3=900, 300*0.31=93, so total is 993 K? But wait that can't be right, because in an adiabatic expansion, the temperature should drop, not increase.

Wait wait, no, wait adiabatic expansion causes the gas to do work and lose internal energy, so the temperature should decrease. So why am I getting an increase? That can't be right.

Ah, I must have made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-express the formula.

Wait, earlier I derived T2 = T1 * (P1/P2)^{(γ-1)/γ}.

But wait, when the pressure decreases (since P2 < P1), P1/P2 is greater than 1. Raising that to a positive exponent (since (γ-1)/γ is positive) would result in T2 being greater than T1, which would imply temperature increases. That can't be correct for an expansion. I must have messed up the formula somewhere.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me go back.

Wait, the correct formula for an adiabatic process is T1 V1^(γ-1) = T2 V2^(γ-1). And since in expansion, V increases, T should decrease. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I derived the T-P relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula T1^(γ) P1^(1-γ) = T2^(γ) P2^(1-γ) ?

Wait, earlier I had:

From PV^γ = constant and PV = nRT,

We can substitute V = nRT/P into PV^γ = constant:

P (nRT/P)^γ = constant.

Which becomes P * (n^γ R^γ T^γ) / P^γ = n^γ R^γ T^γ / P^{γ-1} = constant.

So T^γ / P^{γ-1} = constant.

Thus, (T1^γ)/(P1^{γ-1}) ) = (T2^γ)/(P2^{γ-1}) )

Taking both sides to the 1/γ:

(T1)/(P1^{(γ-1)/γ}) ) = (T2)/(P2^{(γ-1)/γ}) )

Which gives T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1 )^{(γ-1)/gamma} * (T1 * (P2/P1)^{...}) ?

Wait no, rearranging:

T2 = T1 * (P1 / P2 )^{(γ-1)/gamma}.

Wait, that would mean that if P2 < P1, then (P1/P2) is greater than 1, and with a positive exponent, T2 would be higher than T1, which can't be right.

But in adiabatic expansion, the temperature should decrease. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1 )^{(γ-1)/gamma}.

Wait, let me see. Let me rederive it.

Starting from T^γ / P^{γ-1} = constant.

So,

(T1^γ) / (P1^{γ-1}) = (T2^γ) / (P2^{γ-1} )

Dividing both sides by T1^gamma and multiplying by P2^{gamma-1}:

P2^{gamma-1} / P1^{gamma-1} = (T2^gamma) / (T1^gamma )

Take both sides to the 1/gamma:

(T2 / T1) = (P2 / P1 )^{(gamma-1)/gamma }

Ah! So this time, T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^{(gamma-1)/gamma}.

That makes more sense because if P2 < P1, then (P2/P1) is less than 1, and with a positive exponent, the temperature would drop. So this formula gives T2 correctly.

So, earlier mistake was in the direction of the ratio. Now, let's correct that.

So, (gamma-1)/gamma = (2/3)/(5/3) )= 2/5.

So,

T2 = 300 K * (1/20)^(2/5).

Wait, because P2 is 1 atm, P1 is 20 atm, so P2/P1 = 1/20.

So, (1/20) is 0.05. 0.05 raised to the 2/5 power.

Hmm, 0.05^(0.4). Let me compute this.

0.05 is 5e-2, so taking ln(0.05) is about ln(5) + ln(1e-2) = 1.6094 -4.6052 ≈ -3.0.

Wait, more accurately, ln(0.05) ≈ -2.9957 (since ln(1/20) = -ln(20) ≈ -2.9957).

So,

(1/20)^(2/5) = e^{ (2/5)*ln(1/20) } = e^{ (2/5)*(-2.9957) }.

Which is e^(-1.1991) ≈ 0.300.

Wait, because e^-1 is ~0.3679, e^-1.2 is lower. Let me compute e^-1.1991.

We can compute it as e^-1.2 ≈ 0.3012.

Wait, yes, e^-1.2 is approximately 0.3012.

So (1/20)^(2/5) ≈ 0.3012.

So T2 = 300 K * 0.3012 ≈ 90.36 K.

Looking at the options, option F is 90.5 K, which is very close. So the answer must be F.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to avoid any mistakes.

Wait, let me compute (1/20)^(2/5):

Taking the natural logs:

ln(1/20) = -ln(20) ≈-2.9957.

Multiply by 2/5: -2.9957 * 0.4 ≈ -1.1983.

Exponentiate: e^-1.1983 ≈ 0.301.

So 300 * 0.301 ≈90.3 K, which is approximately 90.5 K when rounded, so option F.
</think>

To solve the problem, we use the relationship for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible adiabatic process:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
\]

Here:
- \( T_1 = 300 \, \text{K} \) (initial temperature),
- \( P_1 = 20 \, \text{atm} \) (initial pressure),
- \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{atm} \) (final pressure),
- \( \gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = \frac{\frac{5}{2}R}{\frac{3}{2}R} = \frac{5}{3} \),
- \( \frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma} = \frac{\frac{5}{3} - 1}{\frac{5}{3}} = \frac{2}{5} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{\frac{2}{5}}
\]

\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{\frac{2}{5}}
\]

\[
T_2 = 300 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^{\frac{2}{5}}
\]

To compute \( \left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^{\frac{2}{5}} \), we use logarithms:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{20}\right) = -\ln(20) \approx -2.9957
\]

\[
\left(\frac{1}{20}\right)^{\frac{2}{5}} = e^{\frac{2}{5} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{20}\right)} = e^{\frac{2}{5} \cdot (-2.9957)} = e^{-1
