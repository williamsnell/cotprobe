Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the average atomic mass of chromium. Hmm, I remember that the average atomic mass is based on the isotopes of an element and their abundances. Let me think.

The question gives me four isotopes of chromium with their masses and percent occurrences. So I need to multiply each isotope's mass by its percentage and then sum them all up. Oh wait, but the percentages are given without the decimal, I think I need to convert them to fractions first.

The isotopes are:
- 50 amu with 4.31% occurrence,
- 52 amu with 83.76%,
- 53 amu with 9.55%,
- 54 amu with 2.38%.

Alright, so I'll convert each percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100. Let's do that:

For 50 amu: 4.31% becomes 0.0431.
52 amu: 83.76% → 0.8376.
53 amu: 9.55% → 0.0955.
54 amu: 2.38% → 0.0238.

Now, multiply each mass by its decimal percentage:

50 * 0.0431 = Let's calculate that. 50 * 0.04 is 2, and 50 * 0.0031 is 0.155. So 2 + 0.155 = 2.155.

52 * 0.8376. Hmm, 52 times 0.8 is 41.6. 52 * 0.03 is 1.56, and 52 * 0.0076 is about 0.3952. So adding those together: 41.6 + 1.56 = 43.16, plus 0.3952 gives 43.5552.

53 * 0.0955. Let's see, 53 * 0.09 is 4.77. 53 * 0.0055 is 0.2915. So 4.77 + 0.2915 = 5.0615.

54 * 0.0238. 54 * 0.02 is 1.08. 54 * 0.0038 is 0.2052. So 1.08 + 0.2052 = 1.2852.

Now, add all these products together:

2.155 (from 50) + 43.5552 (52) = 45.7102.

Adding the 53's contribution: 45.7102 + 5.0615 = 50.7717.

Then add the 54's part: 50.7717 + 1.2852 = 52.0569.

Wait, that's approximately 52.057 amu. Let me check the options. Option E is 52.057 amu. So the average atomic mass should be around that.

But wait, let me make sure I did the calculations correctly. Maybe I should re-calculate to avoid any mistake.

Let me compute each part again quickly:

50 * 0.0431: 50 * 0.04 is 2, 50 * 0.0031 is 0.155. Total 2.155. That's correct.

52 * 0.8376: Let me compute 52 * 0.8376. Breaking down 0.8376 into 0.8 + 0.03 + 0.0076.

52 * 0.8 = 41.6. 52 * 0.03 = 1.56. 52 * 0.0076 = 0.3952. Adding all: 41.6 + 1.56 is 43.16 + 0.3952 = 43.5552. Correct.

53 * 0.0955: 53 * 0.09 is 4.77, 53 * 0.0055 is 0.2915. Adding gives 5.0615. Correct.

54 * 0.0238: 54 * 0.02 is 1.08, 54 * 0.0038 is 0.2052. Sum to 1.2852. Correct.

Adding all four: 2.155 + 43.5552 is 45.7102. Plus 5.0615 is 50.7717. Plus 1.2852 gives 52.0569. So yeah, approximately 52.057 amu.

Looking at the options, option E is 52.057. So the answer should be E.

To calculate the average atomic mass of chromium, we use the isotopic masses and their respective percent occurrences. The formula is:

\[
\text{Average atomic mass} = \sum (\text{Isotopic mass} \times \text{Fractional abundance})
\]

The isotopes and their data are:

- \( ^{50}\text{Cr} \): 50 amu, 4.31% → \( 0.0431 \)
- \( ^{52}\text{Cr} \): 52 amu, 83.76% → \( 0.8376 \)
- \( ^{53}\text{Cr} \): 53 amu, 9.55% → \( 0.0955 \)
- \( ^{54}\text{Cr} \): 54 amu, 2.38% → \( 0.0238 \)

Calculations:

1. \( 50 \times 0.0431 = 2.155 \)
2. \( 52 \times 0.8376 = 43.5552 \)
3. \( 53 \times 0.0955 = 5.0615 \)
4. \( 54 \times 0.0238 = 1.2852 \)

Summing these values:

\[
2.155 + 43.5552 + 5.0615 + 1.2852 = 52.0569 \, \text{amu}
\]

Rounding to four significant figures gives \( 52.057 \, \text{amu} \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is **E: 52.057 amu**.
