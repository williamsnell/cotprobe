Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about balancing a half-reaction in an acid solution. The question is about the bromate ion, BrO3-, reacting to form bromine, Br2. I need to figure out the balanced half-reaction and determine which option correctly describes the number of electrons involved.

Hmm, I remember that in redox reactions, the elements change oxidation states, and the half-reactions need to be balanced for atoms and charge. Let me think about the oxidation states here.

Bromine in BrO3-: Oxygen is usually -2, so let's calculate Br. The formula is BrO3^-. The sum of oxidation states should be -1. So Br + 3*(-2) = -1. That gives Br -6 = -1, so Br is +5.

In Br2, bromine is in elemental form, so its oxidation state is 0. So each Br goes from +5 to 0. That means each Br atom is being reduced because it's gaining electrons. Wait, no, wait—reduction is gain of electrons. So each Br is going from +5 to 0, which is a change of 5 electrons gained per Br atom.

Wait, but wait a second—since Br is going from +5 to 0, that's a reduction, right? Because reduction is when something gains electrons. So each Br atom gains 5 electrons.

But wait, BrO3^- is the starting point, and it's forming Br2. So two Br atoms are involved in Br2, right? Each Br comes from BrO3^-.

Wait, let me write the initial half-reaction. The reactants are BrO3^- and the products are Br2. So:

BrO3^- → Br2

But I need to balance this in acidic solution. So I can add H+ and H2O as needed.

First, balance the Br atoms. On the left, I have one Br, and on the right, two Br atoms. So I need to put a 2 in front of BrO3^- and a 1 in front of Br2? Wait, no, no.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say the reaction is:

2 BrO3^- → Br2 

Then, each mole of BrO3^- has one Br, so two moles give two Br atoms, which combine to form one Br2 molecule. So that balances Br.

Now, the oxygen from BrO3^- needs to be accounted for. Since it's in acidic solution, I can add H2O to the product side and H+ to the reactant side. Each BrO3^- has three O's, so two BrO3^- would have 6 O's. These would form 6 H2O molecules on the product side.

So adding H2O:

2 BrO3^- → Br2 + 6 H2O

Now, balance the O by adding H+ to the other side. Wait, no, O is on the right as H2O. So maybe I should add H+ to the left. Let me think: for each H2O, I can add H+ to the opposite side.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to balance O with H2O, then H with H+, and then charge with electrons.

So, let's go step by step.

1. Balance Br: 2 BrO3^- → Br2.

2. Balance O: on the left, 2 BrO3^- have 6 O. So add 6 H2O on the right.

So: 2 BrO3^- → Br2 + 6 H2O.

3. Now, balance H: on the right, 6 H2O have 12 H. So add 12 H+ to the left side.

So the equation becomes: 2 BrO3^- + 12 H+ → Br2 + 6 H2O.

4. Now, check the charges on each side to balance the electrons.

Left side: 2*(-1) from BrO3^- and 12*(+1) from H+. So 2*(-1)=-2, 12*(+1)=+12. Total charge on left is (-2 +12)=+10.

Right side: Br2 is neutral, 6 H2O is neutral. So total charge is 0.

The difference is +10 on the left and 0 on the right. To balance the charges, we need to add electrons to one side.

In reduction, electrons are on the reactant side (because they are gained). Wait, in this case, Br is being reduced because it goes from +5 to 0. So each Br gains 5 electrons.

In the reaction, each Br atom goes from +5 to 0, so each gains 5 e^-. There are two Br atoms in Br2, so total electrons gained are 2*5=10 electrons.

Wait, but wait—since the left side is at +10 and right is at 0, the left is higher. So to balance, we can add 10 electrons to the left side, which would bring the charge down. Let me see.

Alternatively, the standard method is: calculate the change in oxidation state, determine the number of electrons, and then adjust the equation.

Each Br in BrO3^- is +5 → 0 in Br2. Each Br gains 5 electrons. So two Br atoms gain 10 electrons total.

So the half-reaction would have 10 electrons on the left (reactant) side. Because when Br is reduced, the electrons are consumed.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the left side is 2 BrO3^- + 12 H+ → Br2 + 6 H2O.

The charge on the left is 2*(-1) + 12*(+1) = -2 +12 = +10.

Charge on the right is 0.

So the left is +10, right is 0. So to make them equal, we can add 10 electrons to the left side. Because each electron is -1, adding 10 e^- to the left would make the left side charge +10 -10 (because 10*(-1)) = 0, which matches the right.

So the balanced equation would be:

2 BrO3^- + 12 H+ + 10 e^- → Br2 + 6 H2O.

So the number of electrons is 10 on the left side.

Looking at the options, the question is about the balanced half-reaction, which includes the number of electrons.

The question asks, "the balanced half-reaction has..." and the options are about where the electrons are.

In the equation I've written, electrons are on the left (reactant side), so it's 10 electrons on the left.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are:

A: 6 electrons on the right

B: 3 electrons on the right

C: 10 electrons on the right

D: 10 electrons on the left

E: 5 electrons on the right

F: 3 electrons on the left

G: 6 electrons on the left

H: 2 electrons on the left

I: 5 electrons on the left

J: 2 electrons on the right

So in the balanced equation I have, the electrons are on the left, and there are 10 of them. So option D is 10 electrons on the left.

Wait, but let me think again. Because in a reduction half-reaction, the electrons are on the reactant (left) side. So yes, that makes sense.

So the correct answer should be option D.

To balance the half-reaction for bromate ions (BrO₃⁻) forming bromine (Br₂) in an acidic solution, we start by considering the oxidation states and the changes involved. Bromine in BrO₃⁻ has an oxidation state of +5, while in Br₂, it is 0. This indicates a reduction, as bromine gains electrons.

The initial unbalanced reaction is:

\[
2 \, \text{BrO}_3^- \rightarrow \text{Br}_2
\]

1. **Balance bromine atoms**: Two BrO₃⁻ molecules on the left provide two Br atoms, which form one Br₂ molecule on the right. This balances the bromine atoms.

2. **Balance oxygen atoms**: Each BrO₃⁻ contains three oxygen atoms, so two BrO₃⁻ molecules have six oxygen atoms. These are balanced by adding six H₂O molecules on the right.

\[
2 \, \text{BrO}_3^- \rightarrow \text{Br}_2 + 6 \, \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

3. **Balance hydrogen atoms**: The six H₂O molecules on the right contain 12 hydrogen atoms. To balance these, 12 H⁺ ions are added to the left.

\[
2 \, \text{BrO}_3^- + 12 \, \text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{Br}_2 + 6 \, \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

4. **Balance charges with electrons**: The left side has a total charge of \(2(-1) + 12(+1) = +10\), while the right side is neutral. To balance the charges, 10 electrons (\(e^-\)) are added to the left side:

\[
2 \, \text{BrO}_3^- + 12 \, \text{H}^+ + 10 \, e^- \rightarrow \text{Br}_2 + 6 \, \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

In this balanced half-reaction, there are 10 electrons on the left side. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**D: 10 electrons on the left**
