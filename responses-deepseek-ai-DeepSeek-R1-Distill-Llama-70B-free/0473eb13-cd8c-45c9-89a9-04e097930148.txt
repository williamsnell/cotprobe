Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about executive orders, and I need to figure out which statement is NOT true. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that executive orders are official documents issued by the President, used to manage the federal government. They don't require Congress's approval, right? So that means they can be a way for the President to act unilaterally. I think that's correct.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Presidents avoid using executive orders for controversial actions. Hmm, I'm not so sure about this. I remember that sometimes Presidents do use executive orders for things that are controversial, especially when they can't get legislation passed through Congress. Like, maybe on issues where there's a lot of opposition or disagreement. So if that's true, then Option A would be false because Presidents don't necessarily avoid using them for controversial stuff.

Option B: Executive orders have the same effect as laws passed by Congress. I think this is correct because while they aren't laws, they have the force of law. They can create rules that federal agencies must follow, so in effect, they act similarly to laws. But wait, Congress can pass laws to overturn them, right? So maybe they don't have the exact same effect, but they're still powerful. I'm a bit shaky on this.

Option C: Presidents have made increased use of executive orders since the 1970s. I'm not sure about the trend over time. I think some Presidents use them a lot more than others. Like, maybe FDR used a ton of them during the New Deal. But I'm not certain if the usage has been increasing since the 70s. I might need to check this, but for now, I'll tentatively say I'm not sure.

Option D: Executive orders bypass congressional approval. This definitely sounds right. Since the President can issue them without Congress's input, they're a way to bypass the legislative branch. So D is a true statement.

Wait, the question is asking which is NOT true. So looking back at the options, if A is false, then that's the answer. Because if Presidents do use them for controversial actions, then A is incorrect.

Alternatively, let me think more about Option B. Executive orders don't have the same effect as laws because Congress can't pass a law to overturn them, but the next President can easily revoke them. So maybe B is not entirely accurate. Wait, no, the effect is that they are enforceable as law, but they aren't laws. So maybe B is correct in a sense that they have the same effect as laws in terms of enforcement, but they're not legislation. So perhaps B is true.

So circling back, the statement that's not true would be A. Because in reality, Presidents do use executive orders for controversial actions when they can't get Congress to act, or to push through their agenda. So they don't avoid using them; instead, they might rely on them more when there's controversy or deadlock.

So the answer should be option A.

The correct answer is A. Presidents do not avoid using executive orders for controversial actions; in fact, they often use them to bypass congressional opposition or push through contentious policies. Therefore, option A is NOT true.

Answer: A
