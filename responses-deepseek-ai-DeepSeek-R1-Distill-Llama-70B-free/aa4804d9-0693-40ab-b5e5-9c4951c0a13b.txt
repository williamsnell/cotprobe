Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about the phase transition between gray tin and white tin. I remember that phase transitions involve a change in Gibbs free energy, so I think the key here is to use the Clapeyron equation. Hmm, right, the Clapeyron equation relates the change in pressure and temperature along the phase boundary.

The problem says the two phases are in equilibrium at 1 bar and 18°C. Now they’re asking what temperature they’ll be in equilibrium at 350 bar. I need to find that.

Wait, the Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = (S2 - S1)/(V2 - V1), right? But wait, which phase is which? Let's make sure.

Gray tin and white tin are both solid, so their molar volumes and entropies are given. The densities are 5750 kg/m³ for gray and 7280 kg/m³ for white. Since density is mass/volume, the molar volume would be the molar mass divided by density. Oh, right! So I need the molar masses of tin. Tin is Sn, atomic number 50, right? The atomic weight is about 118.71 g/mol. So molar mass is 0.11871 kg/mol.

So for gray tin, molar volume V = molar mass / density. Let me calculate that.

Gray tin's V = 0.11871 kg/mol / 5750 kg/m³. Let's compute that. 0.11871 /5750 = approximately 2.065e-5 m³/mol. Wait, 5750 is 5.75e3, so 0.11871 /5.75e3 = 0.00002065 m³/mol.

Similarly, white tin's V is 0.11871 /7280. Let me compute that: 7280 is 7.28e3. So 0.11871 /7.28e3 ≈ 1.631e-5 m³/mol.

Wait, so V-gray is 2.065e-5, V-white is 1.631e-5. So the difference ΔV is V_white - V_gray? Or is it V_gray - V_white? Wait, because when considering the phase transition from gray to white, the formula is dP/dT = (S_white - S_gray) / (V_white - V_gray).

Wait, the general form is dP/dT = (S2 - S1)/(V2 - V1), where the process is 1 → 2. In this case, the process is gray → white, so Sn(gray) → Sn(white). So S2 is S_white (51.18 J/K/mol), S1 is S_gray (44.14 J/K/mol). So ΔS = 51.18 - 44.14 = 7.04 J/K/mol.

ΔV would be V_white - V_gray. So 1.631e-5 - 2.065e-5 = -4.34e-6 m³/mol. That's negative, right? Because white tin is denser, so its volume is smaller.

So putting it into the Clapeyron equation: dP/dT = (7.04) / (-4.34e-6) ≈ -1625 K/bar. Wait, that seems like a big number. Let me check the units.

Because m³ is in SI units, and pressure is in bar. So 1 bar is 1e5 Pa, and 1 Pa = 1 N/m². So 1 Pa·m³ = 1 N·m = 1 J. So the units of dP/dT would be (J/(K·mol)) / (m³/mol) ) → J/(m³·K) → which is Pa/K. Since 1 bar is 1e5 Pa, so converting Pa to bar, divide by 1e5.

So 7.04 / (-4.34e-6) ≈ 1625. So the value is negative, so dP/dT ≈ -1625 / 1e5 → approximately -0.01625 bar/K. Wait, that can't be right, because dP/dT is in bar/K. Wait, let me recalculate the units more carefully.

Wait, S is in J/(K·mol), V is in m³/mol. So S/V has units J/(K·mol * m³/mol) ) → J/(K·m³). Which is equivalent to (N·m)/(K·m³) ) → N/(K·m²) → Pa/K.

So (dP/dT) has units Pa/K. So when I calculate 7.04 / (-4.34e-6), that gives me 7.04 / (-4.34e-6) = approximately -1625 Pa/K. Convert that to bar: since 1 bar is 1e5 Pa, 1625 Pa is 0.01625 bar. So dP/dT is approximately -0.01625 bar/K.

Wait, but the change in pressure from 1 bar to 350 bar is a change of 349 bar. So ΔP is 349 bar. I need to find the corresponding ΔT.

The Clapeyron equation assumes that dP/dT is approximately constant over small ranges, which might not hold here, but maybe for this problem, we can make that approximation.

So, integrating the Clapeyron equation: ΔT = (ΔP) / (dP/dT). But wait, dP/dT is negative, so as pressure increases, temperature would change in the opposite direction.

Wait, the equation can be written as:

dP = (ΔS / ΔV) dT.

So, rearranged, dT = (ΔV / ΔS) dP.

Wait, ΔV is negative, and dP is positive (since pressure increases from 1 bar to 350 bar). So dT would be negative, implying that the temperature decreases.

Let me compute ΔP = 350 bar - 1 bar = 349 bar.

So, dT = (ΔV / ΔS) * dP.

But wait, let me get the variables right. ΔV is V_white - V_gray = -4.34e-6 m³/mol.

ΔS is S_white - S_gray = +7.04 J/(K·mol).

So dT = (ΔV / ΔS) * dP.

Plugging in the numbers: ( (-4.34e-6 m³/mol) / (7.04 J/(K·mol)) ) ) * 349 bar.

Wait, but units need to be consistent. The denominator is in J/(K·mol), numerator is m³/mol. So m³/(J/(K·mol)) ) → J·m³/(K·mol²). Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps using the Clapeyron equation in the form:

ΔT = (T_initial) * (ΔV / ΔS) * (ΔP / P_initial)

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the approximation for the slope.

Alternatively, considering that dP/dT = (S2 - S1)/(V2 - V1) → which is (51.18 -44.14)/( (1.631e-5 - 2.065e-5) ) → 7.04 / (-4.34e-6) ≈ -1625 Pa/K → -1625 Pa/K = -0.01625 bar/K.

So dP/dT is -0.01625 bar/K.

So, for a change in pressure ΔP, the change in temperature ΔT is approximately ΔT = (dP/dT)^-1 * ΔP.

Wait, no, because dP/dT is the derivative, so for small changes, ΔP ≈ (dP/dT) * ΔT → ΔT ≈ ΔP / (dP/dT).

But wait, dP/dT is negative, so if you increase pressure, the temperature change would be negative, meaning temperature decreases.

Wait, let me think: At higher pressure, which phase is favored? The phase with the smaller molar volume is favored at higher pressure because it has lower volume, so dP/dT is negative here, meaning that as pressure increases, the phase with lower volume (white tin) is favored, so the transition temperature decreases.

So, the initial equilibrium is at T1 = 18°C (291.15 K) at P1 = 1 bar.

We need to find T2 at P2 =350 bar.

So, using the approximation:

ΔT ≈ (dT/dP) * ΔP.

But wait, dT/dP is the reciprocal of dP/dT. So, dT/dP = 1/(dP/dT) = 1/(-0.01625 bar/K) → approximately -61.54 K/bar.

So, ΔT = dT/dP * ΔP = (-61.54 K/bar) * (349 bar) = -61.54 * 349 ≈ let's compute that.

60 * 350 is 21,000. But 61.54 is a bit more than 60, but 349 is a bit less than 350. So let's compute exactly:

61.54 * 349 = ?

Let me compute 61.54 * 300 = 18,462.

61.54 *49 = ?

61.54 * 50 = 3077, minus 61.54 → 3077 -61.54 = 3015.46.

So total is 18,462 + 3015.46 = 21,477.46.

So ΔT ≈ -21,477.46 / 100 = wait, no, wait: wait ΔT is (-61.54 K/bar) * 349 bar → that's approximately -21,477 K? That can't be right because that's way too large. Wait, no, wait no, that's not possible. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 61.54 K/bar * 349 bar is 61.54 * 349 ≈ Let's compute 60 * 349 = 20,940. Then 1.54 * 349 ≈ 537.46. So total is 21477.46 K? That's impossible because we're talking about a temperature change, and that would take us way below absolute zero.

Wait, I must have messed up the units somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, dP/dT is about -0.01625 bar/K. So dT = (dP) / (dP/dT) → (349 bar) / (-0.01625 bar/K) → 349 / (-0.01625) K → approximately 349 / 0.01625 is around 21,469 K. So with the negative sign, it's about -21,469 K, which is way too low. That can't be right. I must be making a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should use the Clapeyron equation in terms of the reciprocal. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the equation:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔS / ΔV) (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Wait, no, that's not the standard approach. Alternatively, perhaps the equation is better expressed as:

ΔG = 0 at equilibrium, so S dT - V dP = 0 for the phase transition. So, for the process, dP/dT = (S2 - S1)/(V2 - V1). But maybe for large pressure changes, we can't use the linear approximation and need to integrate.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, but that's usually for phase transitions involving a gas. Since this is solid-solid, perhaps the Clapeyron equation is more appropriate.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the integrated form of the Clapeyron equation, assuming ΔV and ΔS are constant.

The integrated form is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔS / ΔV) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = (ΔS)/(ΔV). Assuming ΔS and ΔV are constant, we can integrate both sides.

So, integrating from T1, P1 to T2, P2:

∫ (from P1 to P2) dP = ∫ (from T1 to T2) (ΔS/ΔV) dT.

So, ΔP = (ΔS/ΔV) * (T2 - T1).

Wait, no, because dP = (ΔS/ΔV) dT → ∫dP = ∫(ΔS/ΔV) dT → P2 - P1 = (ΔS/ΔV)(T2 - T1).

Wait, but ΔV is negative, as earlier determined. So rearranging:

T2 - T1 = ( (P2 - P1) * ΔV ) / ΔS.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

ΔV is V_white - V_gray = (1.631e-5 - 2.065e-5) = -4.34e-6 m³/mol.

ΔS is 7.04 J/(K·mol).

P2 - P1 = 350 bar - 1 bar = 349 bar. But we need to convert bar to Pascals because our ΔV is in m³ and ΔS in J.

So 349 bar = 349e5 Pa.

So, T2 - T1 = (349e5 Pa * (-4.34e-6 m³/mol)) / (7.04 J/(K·mol)).

Wait, let's compute the numerator:

349e5 * (-4.34e-6) = 349e5 * (-4.34e-6) → Let's compute 349 * (-4.34) = approx 349 * 4 is 1396, 349 * 0.34 is around 118.66. So 1396 + 118.66 = 1514.66, with the negative sign → -1514.66.

So 349e5 * (-4.34e-6) = (349 * 1e5) * (-4.34e-6) = 349 * (-4.34) * (1e5 * 1e-6) ) → 349*(-4.34) * 0.1 → 349*(-0.434) → which is approximately -151.4 (since 349 *0.4=139.6, 349*0.034≈11.866 → total 151.466 → with negative sign, -151.466).

Wait, wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me compute 349e5 Pa * (-4.34e-6 m³/mol) = 349e5 * (-4.34e-6) = 349 * (-4.34) * 1e5 * 1e-6 → 349 * (-4.34) * 0.1 → 349 * (-0.434) → let's compute that.

349 * 0.4 = 139.6; 349 * 0.034 = approx 11.866. So 139.6 +11.866=151.466 → 0.434 * 349 ≈ 151.466. So with the negative, it's -151.466.

So the numerator is -151.466 J/mol (since Pa·m³ = J).

Denominator is 7.04 J/(K·mol).

So T2 - T1 = (-151.466 J/mol) / (7.04 J/(K·mol)) → -151.466 /7.04 ≈ -21.5 K.

So T2 = T1 -21.5 K.

T1 is 18°C which is 291.15 K. So T2 = 291.15 K -21.5 K ≈ 269.65 K.

Convert that to Celsius: 269.65 -273.15 = -3.5°C.

So the answer should be -3.5°C. Let me check the options: option C is -3.5°C.

To solve the problem, we use the Clapeyron equation, which relates the change in pressure and temperature along the phase boundary:

\[
\frac{dP}{dT} = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta V}
\]

Here, the phase transition is between gray tin and white tin, with the equilibrium temperature at 1 bar being \( T_1 = 18^\circ \mathrm{C} = 291.15 \, \mathrm{K} \). We are tasked with finding the equilibrium temperature \( T_2 \) at \( P_2 = 350 \, \mathrm{bar} \).

### Step 1: Calculate molar volumes
The molar mass of tin is \( 0.11871 \, \mathrm{kg/mol} \). Using the densities:
- For gray tin: \( V_{\text{gray}} = \frac{0.11871}{5750} \approx 2.065 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{m^3/mol} \)
- For white tin: \( V_{\text{white}} = \frac{0.11871}{7280} \approx 1.631 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{m^3/mol} \)

The difference in molar volumes is:
\[
\Delta V = V_{\text{white}} - V_{\text{gray}} = 1.631 \times 10^{-5} - 2.065 \times 10^{-5} = -4.34 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{m^3/mol}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate entropy difference
The molar entropies are given as:
- \( S_{\text{gray}} = 44.14 \, \mathrm{J/(K \cdot mol)} \)
- \( S_{\text{white}} = 51.18 \, \mathrm{J/(K \cdot mol)} \)

The difference in entropy is:
\[
\Delta S = S_{\text{white}} - S_{\text{gray}} = 51.18 - 44.14 = 7.04 \, \mathrm{J/(K \cdot mol)}
\]

### Step 3: Apply the Clapeyron equation
The Clapeyron equation can be integrated to relate pressure and temperature changes:
\[
\Delta P = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta V} \Delta T
\]

Rearranging for \( \Delta T \):
\[
\Delta T = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta S} \Delta P
\]

Here, \( \Delta P = P_2 - P_1 = 350 \, \mathrm{bar} - 1
