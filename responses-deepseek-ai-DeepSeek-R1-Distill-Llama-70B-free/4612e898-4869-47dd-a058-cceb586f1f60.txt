Question:

A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?

Options:

A: Hematoma of the left thigh
B: Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve
C: Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization
D: Side effect of prolonged bed rest
E: Peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes
F: Spinal cord injury during IVC filter placement
G: Sciatic nerve damage during hospitalization
H: Adverse reaction to warfarin
I: Complication of the IVC filter placement
J: Deep vein thrombosis in the left leg

Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's start by reading it carefully.

The patient is a 67-year-old woman who had a pulmonary embolism and was treated in the hospital for three weeks. She also had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage, so they stopped her anticoagulant therapy and placed an IVC filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving when she was discharged two weeks ago. Now, she's reporting a persistent tingling and numbness in her left thigh. This started after she left the hospital, and it's improved a bit over the past week. She's on warfarin now. Her vitals are normal, skin looks fine, muscle strength is normal, but there's decreased sensation in a 5x5 cm area on the lateral part of her left anterior thigh.

The question is asking what's most likely causing this decreased sensation.

Hmm. So, the symptoms are localized to a specific area. Tingling and numbness suggest some kind of nerve issue. Let's think about the possible causes.

Looking at the options:

A: Hematoma of the left thigh. Well, she did have a hematoma that was resolving on discharge. If the hematoma was near a nerve, maybe it compressed it, leading to numbness. But the discharge was two weeks ago, and the symptoms have been improving. So maybe it's possible, but I'm not sure. Also, the area is small, which might fit a local hematoma.

B: Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. Oh, wait, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (also known as the nerve of the thigh) supplies the skin on the lateral part of the thigh. Compression of this nerve is known as meralgia paresthetica. It causes numbness, tingling, or burning in that specific area. It's usually due to entrapment, maybe from tight clothing or prolonged standing, but could also happen from a hematoma pressing on the nerve.

C: Cerebral infarction. That's a stroke. But she had a PE and was treated; a stroke would more likely present with sudden deficits, and she didn't report it in the hospital. Also, her muscle strength is normal, and sensation is only decreased in a small area. So this seems unlikely.

D: Side effect of prolonged bed rest. Bed rest can cause pressure sores or nerve compression. But the area is specific, and I'm not sure if bed rest alone would cause this kind of localized neuropathy without some pressure point.

E: Peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes. There's no mention of diabetes in the patient's history. It's an option, but I don't have evidence for it here.

F: Spinal cord injury during IVC filter placement. IVC filters are placed in the lower abdomen, below the spine. Spinal cord injury during that procedure seems unlikely. Plus, spinal cord issues would probably cause more widespread symptoms, not just a small area on one thigh.

G: Sciatic nerve damage during hospitalization. Sciatic nerve issues would cause symptoms in the back of the thigh, down the leg, maybe. The patient's symptoms are on the lateral anterior thigh, which doesn't align with the sciatic nerve distribution. So probably not.

H: Adverse reaction to warfarin. Warfarin is an anticoagulant. Side effects include bleeding, but I don't think it causes nerve symptoms directly. Unless she had a bleed that affected a nerve, but that would tie back to another option.

I: Complication of the IVC filter placement. IVC filter complications could include migration, causing local issues. If part of the filter moved and pressed on a nearby structure, maybe a nerve. But the IVC is in the lower abdomen, near the spine. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is higher up, around the inguinal ligament. So maybe the filter placement itself didn't directly cause nerve compression there. Not sure though.

J: Deep vein thrombosis in the left leg. DVT would cause swelling, pain, but not necessarily localized numbness unless there's nerve compression due to swelling. She's on warfarin, which is treating DVT/PE. But her symptoms have improved, which doesn't fit with an acute DVT.

So, going back. The area affected is the lateral anterior thigh. That's the area served by the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. So, compression of that nerve (meralgia paresthetica) is a strong possibility. Now, why would that happen here?

She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage and the IVC filter was placed. Maybe during the filter placement, there was some compression or trauma to the nerve. Alternatively, the hematoma from the retroperitoneal hemorrhage might have caused pressure on the nerve. But the filter is placed below the level of the renal veins, so maybe it's lower than the nerve's path.

Wait, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve passes near the inguinal ligament, entering the thigh. If the IVC filter was placed correctly, maybe it's possible that the procedure caused some irritation. Alternatively, perhaps the patient was positioned in a way during the procedure that caused compression of the nerve. Or, more likely, maybe the hematoma caused some pressure on the nerve.

But her symptoms started after discharge, right? Because she didn't report it in the hospital. So maybe the hematoma was resolving, and as it got smaller, the compression lessened, leading to improvement. That fits with option A, but the area is improving. Alternatively, maybe the nerve was compressed during her hospital stay, perhaps from prolonged pressure (like lying in bed in a certain position), leading to meralgia paresthetica.

Alternatively, the IVC filter itself might have caused a complication. If part of the filter migrated and is pressing on the nerve, that could cause the symptoms. But I'm not sure how likely that is. Filter migration can happen, but it's rare and might present more dramatically.

Another thought: during the IVC filter placement, they use a catheter, and sometimes this can cause local nerve injury if the needle or catheter irritates a nearby nerve. But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, the patient's only medication is warfarin. So it's unlikely to be a drug side effect. So looking at the options, B seems possible. Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.

But what caused the compression? Let's see. She had a hematoma that was resolving. If the hematoma was near the path of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, then as it resolved, the compression would decrease, leading to improvement of symptoms. That fits with the timeline.

So the most likely cause is that a hematoma caused compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, leading to the symptoms. So the answer would be A? Wait, no, option A is "Hematoma of the left thigh." But the question is about the cause of the decreased sensation. So the immediate cause is the nerve compression, which is option B. But the underlying cause is the hematoma.

Wait, the options are about the most likely cause. So the answer would be B: Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. The hematoma caused that compression. So the primary issue is the nerve compression, which is option B.

Alternatively, maybe the hematoma is the cause, but since the question is about the decreased sensation, which is due to the nerve compression. So the choice would be B.

Wait, but another possibility is that the IVC filter placement caused the nerve compression. So perhaps the filter is pressing against the nerve. But the IVC is in the abdomen, and the filter is placed below the renal veins, so it's a bit far from the thigh. Unless the filter migrated upward, but that seems unlikely.

So putting it all together, the most likely scenario is that the patient developed meralgia paresthetica due to compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, which was likely caused by a hematoma during her hospital stay. So the direct cause is the nerve compression, which is option B. The question is about the cause of the decreased sensation, so the answer is B.
</think>

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of pulmonary embolism, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, and placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She reports persistent tingling and numbness in a 5x5 cm area on the lateral aspect of her left anterior thigh, which has improved over time. The symptoms suggest a localized nerve issue, specifically involving the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, which supplies sensation to that area. 

The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve can be compressed, leading to meralgia paresthetica, characterized by numbness, tingling, or burning in its distribution. This compression could have been caused by a hematoma near the nerve during her hospitalization, as hematomas can exert pressure on nearby nerves. The improvement in symptoms aligns with the resolution of the hematoma. Other options, such as complications from IVC filter placement or sciatic nerve damage, are less likely given the specific location and nature of the symptoms. The most likely cause of the decreased sensation is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.

Answer: B
