Okay, so I've got this question about a single-phase one-pulse controlled circuit, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what the question says.

Hmm, the load has a counter emf E of 200 volts. The source voltage is given as 400 sin(314t). So, the source is AC, right? And the circuit is controlled, probably using something like an SCR or thyristor, since it's a one-pulse circuit. 

Wait, the question is about the range of firing angle control when the load counter emf is 200 V. The options are various angle ranges. I remember that in such circuits, the firing angle determines when the thyristor switches on, and this affects the average load voltage or current.

I think the key here is to find the range of firing angles where the thyristor can conduct. The firing angle theta is measured from the point where the source voltage starts to rise. Oh right, in a single-phase half-wave controlled rectifier (since it's one-pulse), the output is controlled by the firing angle.

The load counter emf E is 200 V. The source is 400 sin(314t), which means the peak source voltage is 400 V. So the maximum possible voltage across the load would be when the thyristor is conducting at the right time.

Wait, but when does the thyristor conduct? The thyristor can only conduct if the source voltage is greater than the load counter emf. Because if the source voltage is lower than E, the thyristor won't fire even if we apply a gate pulse.

So, the source voltage must be higher than E for the thyristor to start conducting. Let's calculate when that happens. The source voltage is 400 sin(theta), and the load is 200 V. So, we set 400 sin(theta) = 200.

Solving for theta: sin(theta) = 200 / 400 = 0.5. So theta is 30 degrees and 150 degrees in the first and second quadrants. But wait, in a half-wave rectifier, the thyristor can only fire once per cycle, so the firing angle has to be such that it's after the source voltage crosses E, but before the next zero crossing.

Wait, no. Oh wait, the firing angle is measured from the voltage zero crossing. So when the source voltage starts to go positive, that's 0 degrees. The firing angle theta is the angle at which the gate pulse is applied. If theta is too low, like less than 30 degrees, then the source voltage is already higher than E, so the thyristor would conduct naturally without a gate pulse. But wait, in reality, without a gate pulse, the thyristor doesn't conduct unless the breakover voltage is reached. But in a controlled rectifier, we apply the gate pulse at a specific angle to turn it on. So, if the source voltage is above E at the firing angle, then the load current will flow.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The thyristor will only conduct if the anode voltage is higher than the cathode. The load counter emf is opposing the source. So, for the thyristor to conduct, the source voltage must be higher than the load's back emf. So, the condition is V_source >= E.

So, the minimum angle where V_source equals E is when 400 sin(theta) = 200. So sin(theta) = 0.5, which gives theta = 30 degrees and 150 degrees.

But wait, the firing angle can't be less than 30 degrees because below that, the source voltage hasn't reached E yet, so even if you fire the thyristor, it won't conduct because V_source < E. So the earliest firing angle is when V_source equals E, which is at 30 degrees.

But wait, if the firing angle is too close to 180 degrees, what happens? Because after 180 degrees, the source voltage starts to decrease. If the firing angle is beyond 180, but wait, that's not possible because the maximum angle in a sine wave is 180 for the positive half.

Wait, I think the firing angle can range from when the source voltage is just enough to overcome E, so from 30 degrees up to a point where the thyristor can still conduct. But if the firing angle is too high (close to 180), the conduction period is very short, leading to lower average voltage.

Wait, but the maximum firing angle would be 180 degrees because beyond that, the source voltage would start to become negative, and the thyristor wouldn't conduct in that region because it's reverse biased. So the range of firing angles is from 30 degrees to 180 degrees.

But wait, looking at the options, option E is 30 to 180, option A is 60-180, etc.

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe I'm confusing this with the condition when the current flows. Because the load has a counter emf, the current will flow only when V_source > E. So the thyristor must be fired between the angles where V_source is above E. So the earliest firing angle is 30 degrees, and the latest is 150 degrees because after 150 degrees (where sin(theta) is 0.5 again on the descending part), the source voltage drops below E, so even if you fire the thyristor beyond 150, the source voltage is lower than E, so it won't conduct.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because the source is sinusoidal, after 150 degrees, the voltage starts to decrease. So if the firing angle is beyond 150, then when the thyristor fires, the source voltage is already below E, so no current flows.

Wait, but the firing angle is the angle at which the gate is triggered. So for the thyristor to conduct, it has to be triggered when the source voltage is higher than E, which is from 30 degrees up to 150 degrees. Because from 0 to 30, the source voltage is below E, so even if you trigger, it won't conduct. From 30 to 150, the source is above E, so triggering the thyristor in that range will allow current. Beyond 150, the source starts to drop below E again, so triggering there won't help.

Wait, but wait, the source voltage is 400 sin(theta), so at 180 degrees, it's zero. So from 30 degrees to 150 degrees, the source is above E. So the firing angle must be in that range for the thyristor to conduct.

So the firing angle theta can vary from 30 to 150 degrees. So the range is 30° to 150°, which is option F.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option F is 30 to 150. Option E is 30-180, which would include angles where the source is less than E again. So no, the correct range would be from 30 to 150 degrees, because beyond 150, the source voltage is below E again, so the thyristor can't conduct.

So the correct answer is F: 30° to 150°.

Wait, but other sources I've read say that the firing angle can go up to 180 degrees. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in the case when the load is inductive, the current can continue to flow even after the source voltage drops below E, due to the inductor's stored energy. But the question doesn't specify the nature of the load beyond having a counter emf. Oh wait, the question says the load has a resistance R and a counter emf E. So it's a DC load? Or a DC back emf?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the load is a counter emf, which is DC, perhaps. So when the thyristor fires, the current starts to flow, and if the load is inductive, it might keep conducting beyond the point where the source voltage drops below E. But if it's purely resistive, then the current would stop when the source drops below E.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify inductance, only R and E. So the load is a series combination of resistance and a back emf. So, in such a case, the current flows only when V_source > E. So the firing angle must be such that it is after the source exceeds E and before it drops below again.

So the firing angle theta must be between 30 degrees (when V_source = E) and 150 degrees (when V_source = E again on the way down). So the range is 30 to 150 degrees, which is option F.

I think that's the correct approach. So the answer should be F.

To determine the range of firing angle control for a single-phase one-pulse controlled circuit with a load counter emf \( E = 200 \, \text{V} \) and a source voltage \( V_{\text{source}} = 400 \sin(314t) \), we analyze the conditions under which the thyristor can conduct.

The thyristor will conduct only when the source voltage \( V_{\text{source}} \) is greater than the load counter emf \( E \). This condition is derived from the equation:

\[
V_{\text{source}} = 400 \sin(\theta) \geq 200
\]

Solving for \( \theta \), we find:

\[
\sin(\theta) \geq \frac{200}{400} = 0.5
\]

This gives two critical angles:

\[
\theta = 30^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \theta = 150^\circ
\]

Thus, the thyristor can only conduct when the firing angle \( \theta \) is between \( 30^\circ \) and \( 150^\circ \). Firing angles outside this range result in \( V_{\text{source}} < E \), preventing conduction.

From the given options:

- **Option A (60° to 180°):** Incorrect, as it includes angles where \( V_{\text{source}} < E \).
- **Option B (90° to 150°):** Incorrect, as it excludes valid firing angles between \( 30^\circ \) and \( 90^\circ \).
- **Option C (60° to 150°):** Incorrect, as it excludes valid firing angles between \( 30^\circ \) and \( 60^\circ \).
- **Option D (30° to 120°):** Incorrect, as it excludes valid firing angles between \( 120^\circ \) and \( 150^\circ \).
- **Option E (30° to 180°):** Incorrect, as it includes angles where \( V_{\text{source}} < E \).
- **Option F (30° to 150°):** Correct, as it matches the valid range of firing angles where \( V_{\text{source}} \geq E \).
- **Option G (60° to 120°):** Incorrect, as it excludes valid firing angles between \( 30^\circ \) and \( 60^\circ \), and between \( 120^\circ \) and \( 150^\circ \).
- **Option H (90° to 180°):** Incorrect, as it includes angles where \( V_{\text{source}} < E \).
- **Option I (45° to 180°):** Incorrect, as it includes angles where \( V_{\text{source}} < E \).
- **Option J (45° to 135°):** Incorrect, as it excludes valid firing angles between \( 30^\circ \) and \( 45^\circ \), and between \( 135^\circ \) and \( 150^\circ \).

The correct answer is **Option F: 30° to 150°**, as it represents the valid range of firing angles where the thyristor can conduct.
