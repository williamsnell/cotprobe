Question:

Which of the following is true about the knee joint?

Options:

A: The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion
B: 'knock knee' deformity is due to bilateral genu varum
C: The knee joint is the smallest joint in the body
D: The knee is a hinge joint that only allows flexion and extension
E: A baker's cyst can sometimes be found anterior to the knee
F: The knee joint is not capable of rotation
G: The knee joint includes the hip bone
H: The patella is not part of the knee joint
I: The knee is a ball and socket joint
J: 'Bow leg' deformity is due to bilateral genu valgum

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the knee joint, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me think through each option one by one.

Starting with option A: The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion. I remember that the patellar tap test involves tapping the patella to check for fluid in the knee. If there's an effusion, the patella would float on the fluid, so the test would be positive. So A sounds correct.

Option B: 'Knock knee' deformity is due to bilateral genu varum. Wait, knock knee is when the knees angle in and touch each other, right? Genu varum is when the knees bow outward, which is the opposite, so B must be wrong. Actually, knock knee is genu valgum, so B is incorrect.

Option C: The knee joint is the smallest joint in the body. No, I think the smallest joint is the stapes bone in the middle ear. So C is false.

Option D: The knee is a hinge joint that only allows flexion and extension. Well, the knee is indeed a hinge joint, but does it allow rotation? I think during flexion, some rotation is possible, especially when the knee is bent. So D is incorrect because it says "only" flexion and extension.

Option E: A Baker's cyst can sometimes be found anterior to the knee. Baker's cysts are usually behind the knee, in the popliteal fossa. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: The knee joint is not capable of rotation. I thought that when the knee is slightly flexed, it can rotate a bit, especially during movements like pivoting. So F is incorrect.

Option G: The knee joint includes the hip bone. No, the knee joint is between the femur, tibia, and patella. Hip bone is the pelvis, so G is wrong.

Option H: The patella is not part of the knee joint. Wait, the patella is part of the patellofemoral joint, which is part of the knee joint. So H is incorrect.

Option I: The knee is a ball and socket joint. No, ball and socket are like the shoulder and hip. Knee is a hinge, so I is wrong.

Option J: 'Bow leg' deformity is due to bilateral genu valgum. Wait, bow leg is when the legs curve outward, which is genu varum. So J is incorrect because it says valgum.

So the correct answer must be A. It's the only one that makes sense after reviewing each option.

The correct answer is A.

Answer: A
