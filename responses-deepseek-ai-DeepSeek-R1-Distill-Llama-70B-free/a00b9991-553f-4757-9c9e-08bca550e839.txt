Okay, so I've got this question about melting points of different compounds. Hmm, I remember that melting points relate to the strength of the intermolecular forces in a substance. Let me think about each option.

The options are A to J, each a different chloride compound. Let me list them out:

A: NaCl (sodium chloride)
B: LiCl (lithium chloride)
C: AlCl3 (aluminum chloride)
D: KCl (potassium chloride)
E: FeCl3 (iron(III) chloride)
F: AgCl (silver chloride)
G: CaCl2 (calcium chloride)
H: HCl (hydrochloric acid)
I: MgCl2 (magnesium chloride)
J: CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride)

So, the question is which has the lowest melting point. I need to figure out the types of forces in each.

First, I should categorize each compound. NaCl, KCl, LiCl, CaCl2, MgCl2, FeCl3, AgCl are all ionic salts. AlCl3 is a bit tricky because I think it can be a covalent molecule but might form an ionic lattice under certain conditions. HCl is a molecular (covalent) compound, and CCl4 is also a molecular (covalent) compound.

Ionic compounds typically have higher melting points because the ionic bonds are strong. So, among the ionic ones, the melting point depends on the lattice energy, which is influenced by the charge and size of the ions. Higher charges and smaller ions mean stronger lattices and higher melting points.

So the ionic compounds here are all except H, C, J. Wait, actually, AlCl3 might be a network solid or a molecular solid? Hmm, AlCl3 is a Lewis acid and typically forms dimers, Al2Cl6, in the gas phase. In solid form, it might have a crystalline structure, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's molecular, leading to lower melting points compared to fully ionic salts.

But let's think about the others. The ionic salts NaCl, KCl, etc. have higher melting points. For example, NaCl has a melting point around 800°C, KCl maybe a bit higher or lower? Wait, no, I think KCl has a lower melting point than NaCl because the K+ ion is larger than Na+, so the lattice energy is less. So lattice energy decreases as you go down the group for the same anion.

So for the alkali metal chlorides (LiCl, NaCl, KCl, etc.), the melting points decrease as the cation size increases because the lattice energy decreases.

Looking at the options, the ionic ones would have higher melting points than the molecular ones. So between the ionic and the molecular, the molecular would have lower melting points.

So now, let's see the molecular ones. HCl and CCl4. Both are molecular. HCl is a gas at room temperature, so its melting point is very low. But wait, the question is about compounds, and HCl is a molecular compound. CCl4 is a liquid at room temp, I think. So which has a lower melting point between HCl and CCl4?

Wait, what's the melting point of HCl? HCl is a gas at room temp, which suggests that its melting point is below 0°C. Let me recall. The melting point of HCl is about -114.8°F which is around -81.6°C. On the other hand, CCl4 has a melting point of around -22.9°C. So CCl4's melting point is higher than HCl's. So HCl has a lower melting point than CCl4.

But wait, what about the other compounds? Are any of the ionic ones having lower melting points than HCl? Probably not because ionic compounds generally have much higher melting points than molecular ones. For example, NaCl's melting point is around 800°C, which is way higher than HCl's.

So among all the options, HCl (option H) would have the lowest melting point.

Wait, but wait another thought. What about the other molecular compounds? For example, AlCl3. I think in solid form, AlCl3 has a melting point of around 180°C, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think: Aluminum chloride is a solid at room temperature, but I believe it has a lower melting point than the ionic salts but higher than HCl. So AlCl3's melting point is higher than HCl's.

So the options are HCl which is a gas, so melting point is very low. So HCl's melting point is the lowest among all the options.

So the correct answer should be H.

To determine which compound has the lowest melting point, we analyze the intermolecular forces and types of bonding in each option. Ionic compounds generally have higher melting points due to strong ionic bonds, while molecular compounds typically have lower melting points because of weaker intermolecular forces.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Ionic Compounds**:
   - **NaCl (A)**, **KCl (D)**, **LiCl (B)**, **CaCl2 (G)**, **MgCl2 (I)**, **FeCl3 (E)**, and **AgCl (F)** are all ionic salts. Their melting points are relatively high due to the strength of ionic bonds, which depend on lattice energy. Lattice energy decreases with increasing cation size, so melting points decrease accordingly (e.g., LiCl > NaCl > KCl). However, these melting points are still far higher than those of molecular compounds.

2. **Molecular Compounds**:
   - **AlCl3 (C)** is a molecular compound that forms dimers (Al2Cl6). It has a solid-state structure with a melting point around 180°C, which is lower than ionic compounds but higher than other molecular compounds like HCl.
   - **HCl (H)** is a molecular compound with weak intermolecular forces (dipole-dipole interactions). It is a gas at room temperature, with a melting point of approximately -81.6°C.
   - **CCl4 (J)** is also a molecular compound with weak intermolecular forces (London dispersion forces). Its melting point is around -22.9°C, which is higher than that of HCl.

### Conclusion:
Among the given compounds, **HCl (H)** has the lowest melting point because it is a molecular compound with very weak intermolecular forces, resulting in a melting point far below that of all other options, including both ionic and other molecular compounds.
