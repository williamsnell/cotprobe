Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and energy. Hmm, let's see what it's asking.

Okay, the question says there's a concentrated charge of 10 microcoulombs in a large mass of Bakelite. I need to find the total energy contained in the electric field outside a certain radial distance for four different cases: 10 meters, 1 meter, 10 centimeters, and 1 centimeter.

I remember that the electric field outside a point charge is given by Coulomb's law, E = kQ / r². But wait, the energy stored in the electric field isn't something I've dealt with much. Oh right, the energy stored in the field outside a radius r would be the integral of the electric field energy from that radius to infinity.

The formula for the energy stored in an electric field is U = (1/2)ε₀ ∫ E² dV. Since the field is radial and depends only on r, I can use spherical coordinates. So the integral becomes U = (1/2)ε₀ ∫ (E)² * 4πr² dr, integrated from r to infinity.

Substituting E = kQ / r² into the integral. Let's see, E squared is (k² Q²) / r⁴. So multiplying that by 4πr² gives (4π k² Q²) / r². The integral of 1/r² dr from r to infinity is [ -1/r ] from r to infinity, which is 0 - (-1/r) )= 1/r.

Putting it all together, U = (1/2) ε₀ * (4 π k² Q²) * (1/r) * (1/(something? Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the integral of 1/r² dr from a to infinity is [ -1/r ] evaluated from a to infinity. So that's (0 - (-1/a)) = 1/a. So the energy is U = (1/2) ε₀ * 4 π k² Q² * (1/r) ?

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Let me write it step by step.

E = kQ / r².

The energy U is (1/2)ε₀ ∫ E² dV. For a sphere, dV is 4πr² dr. So,

U = (1/2) ε₀ ∫ (k Q / r² )² * 4 π r² dr, from r to ∞.

Expanding this:

U = (1/2) ε₀ * 4 π k² Q² ∫ (1/r^4) * r^2 dr 

Because (1/r²)^2 is 1/r^4, multiplied by r² from dV gives 1/r².

So the integral becomes ∫ (1/r²) dr from r to ∞.

The integral of 1/r² dr is -1/r. Evaluated from r to ∞ gives (0 - (-1/r)) = 1/r.

Putting it all together:

U = (1/2) * ε₀ * 4 π k² Q² * (1/r) ) * (1/(something? Wait, ε₀ and k are related. Oh right! k is 1/(4πε₀), so k² is 1/(16 π² ε₀²)).

Substituting k = 1/(4π ε₀), so k² = 1/(16 π² ε₀²).

So plugging into U:

U = (1/2) ε₀ * 4 π (1/(16 π² ε₀²)) Q² * (1/r) 

Simplify the constants:

(4 π) / (16 π² ε₀²) ) → 4/(16 π ε₀²) ) → 1/(4 π ε₀²)

Wait, let me recalculate:

(1/2) * ε₀ * 4 π * [1/(16 π² ε₀²)] * Q² * (1/r)

So,

(1/2) * (4 π ε₀) * [1/(16 π² ε₀²)] ) = 

(4 π ε₀) / (2 * 16 π² ε₀²) )

= (4 π ε₀) / (32 π² ε₀² )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4/(32) = 1/8, π/π² = 1/π, ε₀/ε₀² = 1/ε₀.

So this becomes (1)/(8 π ε₀) ) * Q² / r.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Alternatively, let me think about the formula I know for the energy of a point charge.

Oh wait, I think the formula for the electric potential energy of a point charge is U = (1/2) (k Q^2) / r. But wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, electric potential energy for bringing charge from infinity to a point is U = k Q^2 / (2 r), but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. The electric potential (V) at a distance r from a charge Q is V = k Q / r. The potential energy U is Q times V, but that's for a charge in a potential. Wait, but for a single charge, the potential energy stored is (1/2) C V, where C is capacitance. Oh, right! Because for a capacitor, U = (1/2) C V^2. But for a single charge, it's like a spherical capacitor. So the capacitance of a sphere is C = 4 π ε₀ r. Then the energy is U = (1/2) C V^2.

Wait, but the potential V of a sphere is k Q / r. So substituting:

U = (1/2) * (4 π ε₀ r) * (k Q / r )^2.

Simplify this:

(1/2) * 4 π ε₀ r * (k² Q² / r² )

= (1/2) * 4 π ε₀ k² Q² (r / r² )

= (1/2) * 4 π ε₀ k² Q² (1/r )

But k is 1/(4 π ε₀), so k² = 1/(16 π² ε₀² )

Substituting:

U = (1/2) * 4 π ε₀ * (1/(16 π² ε₀² )) * Q² * (1/r )

Simplify:

(4 π ε₀ ) / (2 * 16 π² ε₀² ) ) * Q² / r 

= (4 π ε₀ ) / (32 π² ε₀² ) ) * Q² / r 

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4/(32) = 1/8, π / π² = 1/π, ε₀ / ε₀² = 1/ ε₀.

So,

(1/(8 π ε₀ )) * (Q² / r )

Wait, but wait, I'm getting U = ( Q² ) / (8 π ε₀ r ), but I think the correct formula is U = (1/2) (k Q^2 ) / r. Because when I substitute k = 1/(4 π ε₀ ), then 1/(8 π ε₀ ) is  (1/(4 π ε₀ )) * (1/2) ) → which is (k)/2. So U = (k Q² )/(2) * (1/r ), which is (k Q² )/(2 r ). So yes, that's correct.

So, the energy stored is U = (1/2) k Q² / r.

Wait, but wait, wait. Alternatively, I think the formula is U = (1/2) (Q^2)/(4 π ε₀ r ) ), because k = 1/(4 π ε₀ ), so:

k Q² / (2 r ) = (1/(4 π ε₀ )) Q² / (2 r ) = Q²/(8 π ε₀ r )

But another approach: Let me just rely on the standard formula for the energy stored in the electric field outside radius r for a point charge. I think the formula is U = (1/2) (Q^2)/(4 π ε₀ r )

Because that's the potential energy stored when you have a charge Q at radius r. So U = (1/2) (k Q² ) / r.

So yes, U = (k Q² )/( 2 r )

But let me make sure. From the derivation earlier, the integral gave me U = (1/2) ε₀ 4 π k² Q² (1/r ), but then substituting k = 1/(4 π ε₀ ), I end up with U = ( Q² )/(8 π ε₀ r ). But that seems conflicting with what I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-calculate the substitution.

After substitution, U = (1/2) * ε₀ * 4 π * (k² Q^2) * (1/r )

k = 1/(4 π ε₀ )

k squared is 1/(16 π² ε₀² )

So,

U = (1/2) * ε₀ * 4 π * (1/(16 π² ε₀² )) * Q² * (1/r )

Multiply the constants:

(1/2) * 4 π * 1/(16 π² ) * ε₀ / ε₀² → Let's compute each part:

1/2 * 4 is 2. 2 * π is 2π. 2π / (16 π² ) is (2π) / (16 π² ) )= (1)/(8 π )

And ε₀ / ε₀² is 1/ ε₀.

So,

U = (1/(8 π ε₀ )) * Q² / r

But the formula I thought earlier was U = (1/2) (k Q² ) / r = ( (1/(4 π ε₀ )) Q² )/(2 r ) ) = Q²/(8 π ε₀ r ), which matches the result here. So yes, the energy is U = Q²/(8 π ε₀ r )

Wait, but wait another moment. When I'm computing the energy stored in the field outside radius r, that's the same as the work done to assemble the charge, right? So, if I have a point charge Q, and I consider the energy stored in the field outside radius r, which extends to infinity, the energy should be U = (1/2) (k Q^2 ) / r.

But according to the calculation, it's U = Q²/(8 π ε₀ r )

Alternatively, perhaps I should just use the standard formula for the energy in the field of a point charge: U = (1/2) (k Q²) / r.

Let me just proceed with that formula. Since the problem gives me Q = 10 microcoulombs, which is 10e-6 C.

So for each part, I'll compute U using U = (1/2) * k * Q² / r.

k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C². Let me use k = 9e9 for simplicity.

So, U = 0.5 * 9e9 * (10e-6)^2 / r.

Compute (10e-6)^2: 100e-12 = 1e-10.

So,

U = 0.5 * 9e9 * 1e-10 / r = (0.5 * 9e-1 ) / r = (4.5e-1 ) / r.

Because 9e9 * 1e-10 is 9e-1, which is 0.9. 0.5 * 0.9 is 0.45.

So U = 0.45 / r, where r is in meters.

Wait, wait, let me compute it step by step.

U = (1/2) * k * Q² / r

k = 8.988e9, but I'll use 9e9 for calculation.

Q = 10e-6 C.

So Q squared is (10e-6)^2 = 100e-12 = 1e-10 C².

So,

U = 0.5 * 9e9 * 1e-10 / r.

Compute 9e9 * 1e-10: 9e-1 = 0.9.

So 0.5 * 0.9 = 0.45.

Thus,

U = 0.45 / r (in meters), unit is joules.

Wait, but wait, no. Because r is in meters, so U will be in joules when r is in meters.

So for each case:

(a) r = 10 meters → U = 0.45 / 10 = 0.045 J.

(b) r = 1 meter → U = 0.45 / 1 = 0.45 J.

(c) r = 10 centimeters → which is 0.1 meters. So U = 0.45 / 0.1 = 4.5 J.

(d) r = 1 centimeter → 0.01 meters. So U = 0.45 / 0.01 = 45 J.

But wait, looking at the options, none of them match these values. Because the options don't have 0.045 J, 0.45 J, 4.5 J, 45 J.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should use the formula for the self-energy of a charge distribution.

Wait, the energy stored in the electric field outside radius r is U = (1/2) (Q^2)/(4 π ε₀ r )

Which is the same as U = (k Q^2 )/(2 r ), since k = 1/(4 π ε₀ )

So yes, same as before.

So with Q = 10e-6 C, k = 9e9 N·m²/C²,

U = (9e9 * (10e-6)^2 ) / (2 r )

= (9e9 * 1e-10 ) / (2 r )

= (9e-1 ) / (2 r )

= 0.9 / (2 r )

= 0.45 / r.

So same result as before.

Wait, but let me check with exact values.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So more accurately,

U = (8.988e9 * (10e-6)^2 ) / (2 * r )

Calculating:

(8.988e9) * (1e-10) = 8.988e-1.

Divide by 2: 8.988e-1 / 2 = 4.494e-1.

So,

U = 0.4494 / r.

So approximately 0.45 / r.

So for each case:

(a) r = 10 m → 0.45 /10 = 0.045 J → 0.045 J.

(b) r = 1 m → 0.45 J.

(c) r = 0.1 m → 4.5 J.

(d) r = 0.01 m → 45 J.

Looking at the options, the given answers don't seem to match any of the options. Let me look again.

Options:

Option A: (a) 0.10 J... No.

Option B: (a)0.50, (b)5, (c)50, (d)500.

Hmm, I have for (a) 0.045, which is close to 0.05, but option J has (a) 0.005, (b)0.05, which doesn't fit.

Option I: (a)0.010, (b)0.10, etc. No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait, perhaps the energy expression is different. Another possibility: the energy outside radius r is the same as the energy of a spherical shell of radius r with charge Q. Wait, no, the energy should be the same as the energy of the field outside r.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula I'm using is for the energy stored in the capacitor, which is a different scenario. Maybe in this case, since the charge is embedded in Bakelite (which I think is a dielectric?), but the problem says it's an extensive mass of Bakelite, so the charge is in a medium with permittivity ε. Wait a minute, the problem doesn't specify relative permittivity, so maybe I can assume it's in vacuum? Or perhaps Bakelite has a relative permittivity ε_r, which would affect the calculation.

Wait, the problem states the charge is in an extensive mass of Bakelite. So the medium is Bakelite. So I need to consider the permittivity of Bakelite.

Wait, but the question is about the electric field outside the radial distance. So what's the permittivity there? If the charge is in Bakelite, then the medium around it is Bakelite. So the permittivity ε is ε = ε_r * ε₀, where ε_r is the relative permittivity of Bakelite.

Wait, but what is the relative permittivity of Bakelite? I think Bakelite is a type of plastic, which typically has a relative permittivity of around 4-5. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to treat it as in vacuum. Because the question doesn't give any information about the permittivity. Hmm.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's assuming vacuum. So I'll proceed under that assumption, which is ε = ε₀.

But in that case, the energy I calculated doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using isn't correct. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the energy stored in the electric field outside a sphere of radius r, for a charge Q, is the same as the energy stored in a spherical shell of radius r with charge Q. Which would be U = (1/2) (Q^2)/(4 π ε₀ r )

So U = Q²/(8 π ε₀ r )

So perhaps I should compute it using exact values.

Let me compute it more accurately.

Given Q = 10 μC = 10e-6 C.

So Q² = (10e-6)^2 = 1e-10 C².

r varies as per each part.

Compute for each part:

(a) r = 10 m.

U = (1e-10) / (8 π ε₀ * 10 )

But 1/(4 π ε₀ ) = 9e9, so 1/(8 π ε₀ ) = 4.5e9.
