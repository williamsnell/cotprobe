The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A doctor who was licensed to practice medicine in a particular state was convicted in state court of improperly distributing specified drugs by writing prescriptions for fictitious persons. Under state law, such an abuse of the prescription-writing privilege requires revocation of a doctor's license. After it received an official notification of the doctor's conviction, the state medical board revoked the doctor's license without affording the doctor any opportunity for a hearing. The doctor has sued the board in state court to set aside the revocation, alleging deprivation of property without due process of law because the board did not provide an opportunity for a trial-type hearing before revoking the license. The doctor does not deny the conviction or the factual basis for it. Which of the following is the strongest argument in support of the state medical board?

Options:

A: The doctor's conviction in state court is enough evidence of his guilt, and a hearing before the board would be redundant and unnecessary.
B: The adjudicative facts necessary to revoke the doctor's license were determined in the criminal trial, and therefore due process does not require any further trial-type hearing.
C: The board's decision to revoke the doctor's license without a hearing is justified because of the severe nature of the doctor's crime.
D: The licensing board was required to summarily revoke the doctor's license because Article IV, Section 1, of the Constitution requires the licensing board to give full faith and credit to the doctor's criminal conviction.
E: The medical board was merely following state law, which requires revocation of a doctor's license in such cases.
F: Due process requires a balancing of interests, and the state's interest in preventing drug abuse outweighs the doctor's interest in the particular procedure followed in the disciplinary proceeding.
G: The medical board has an obligation to protect the public from doctors who abuse their prescription-writing privileges, and a hearing would delay necessary action.
H: The doctor's admission of the conviction and its factual basis eliminates the need for a hearing before the board.
I: A doctor's license to practice is a privilege, not a right, and therefore is not property within the meaning of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about due process and medical licensing. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says a doctor was convicted in state court for improperly distributing drugs by writing prescriptions for fictitious people. Under state law, this conviction requires the revocation of his medical license. The state medical board revoked his license without giving him a hearing. Now, the doctor is suing, claiming he was deprived of property without due process because there was no trial-type hearing before the revocation.

The question is about which argument is strongest for the state medical board. The options are A through I.

Hmm. I remember that due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before the government deprives someone of life, liberty, or property. So when a state takes away someone's license, which is a property interest, they usually need to provide some kind of hearing.

But wait, are there exceptions? Like, if there's an emergency or if certain facts are already established. Oh right, in some cases, the court has allowed for immediate action without a hearing if there's a compelling government interest and the facts are not in dispute.

In this case, the doctor was convicted in state court, which is a court of law. So the conviction itself establishes that he did what he's accused of. The medical board received official notification of this conviction. So they probably don't need to redo the fact-finding because it's already been decided in a court.

Wait, but due process doesn't necessarily require a separate hearing if the facts are already established through a judicial proceeding. So the board might argue that since the conviction is a matter of record, there's no need for an additional hearing because the necessary adjudicative facts are already proven.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A says the conviction is enough evidence, so a hearing is redundant. That makes sense, but I'm not sure if it's the strongest argument. Because due process might still require some opportunity to respond, even if it's just to present mitigating circumstances or something.

Option B says the adjudicative facts were determined in the criminal trial, so no further hearing is needed. That sounds like what I was thinking. If the necessary facts for revocation were already decided in court, then the board doesn't need to hold another hearing because the facts are established.

Option C says the severe nature of the crime justifies no hearing. That might not be the best argument because due process isn't usually based on the severity but on the process. Though sometimes exigent circumstances allow for immediate action, but this case might not meet that.

Option D talks about full faith and credit. Article IV, Section 1 requires states to recognize each other's public acts, but I'm not sure if that applies here. The board is state-based, so maybe it's not the main point.

Option E says they're following state law. Well, state law can't override due process, so just following the law isn't enough if the law itself is unconstitutional. So this argument might not be the strongest.

Option F is about balancing interests. Due process does involve balancing, but the state's interest in protecting public health is high. But the issue is whether a hearing is needed. The balancing argument might be relevant, but maybe not the strongest here.

Option G is about protecting the public quickly. Again, similar to C, but more about public safety. It's a policy argument but not sure if it's a legal due process argument.

Option H says the doctor admitted the conviction, so no hearing is needed. But the doctor is suing because he didn't get a hearing, not because he denies the conviction. So even if he admits it, he might still want a hearing to argue other points, like mitigating factors or perhaps challenging the law itself.

Option I claims a license is a privilege, not a property right. But I think the Supreme Court has established that a medical license is a property interest protected by due process. So this argument is probably outdated or incorrect.

So, putting it together: the strongest argument is that the adjudicative facts were already determined in the criminal trial, so no further hearing is needed. That would be option B.
</think>

The strongest argument in support of the state medical board is that the adjudicative facts necessary to revoke the doctor's license were determined in the criminal trial. Since the conviction establishes the factual basis for revocation, due process does not require a separate trial-type hearing before the board. This argument aligns with the principle that when the essential facts have already been adjudicated in a judicial proceeding, additional fact-finding by the administrative body is unnecessary. 

Answer: B
