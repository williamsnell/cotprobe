Okay, so I've got this question about prima facie duties. Hmm, I remember that term from my ethics class. Let me try to unpack it.

First, what does "prima facie" mean? I think it's Latin for "at first glance" or "on the face of it." So a prima facie duty would be a duty that seems to exist at first glance but might not hold up under closer inspection or in the face of other considerations.

Wait, the question is asking about what characteristic makes an act have a prima facie duty. The options are A through D. Let me go through each option.

Option A says it "seems to be right, although this might be illusory." That makes sense because prima facie suggests an initial appearance. So if it seems right but might not actually be, that fits.

Option B: "tends to be right, although this might be outweighed by other considerations." This is a bit tricky. I think prima facie duties are about things that are right in themselves but can be overridden. So this could be correct, but I need to think more.

Option C: "is right." That sounds more like an actual duty, not just prima facie. Because prima facie duties can be outweighed, so the act isn't necessarily right in the end.

Option D: "is the first thing that an agent ought to do, above all else." That doesn't sound right. Prima facie duties are more about initial appearances, not about priority. Unless it's referring to being the first consideration, but I don't think that's the main point.

So, recalling W.D. Ross's theory, he introduced prima facie duties as duties that are binding unless overridden by another duty. So each prima facie duty is a reason to act in a certain way, but they can conflict, and the actual duty is what's decided after considering all.

So, the characteristic is that the act seems right but might be outweighed. So looking back, option B says it tends to be right but might be outweighed. Option A is about seeming right, which could be illusory, but I'm not sure if that's exactly the same as being outweighed.

Wait, the question is about the characteristic in virtue of which the act has a prima facie duty. So it's about what makes the act a prima facie duty. That would be that it's an apparent duty, but it might not hold. So option A says "seems to be right, although this might be illusory." That suggests that the prima facie duty is based on appearance, which might not be the actual case.

Option B is more about the tendency and being outweighed. So perhaps B is also a possible answer. Because a prima facie duty is something that tends to be right, but can be outweighed by other considerations.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. In Ross's view, a prima facie duty is a duty that is binding unless it's overridden by another duty. So each such duty is a reason, but not necessarily the final decision.

So the act has a prima facie duty because it tends to be right, considering one aspect, but other aspects might make it not right overall. So the characteristic is that it tends to be right but can be outweighed. That points to option B.

Alternatively, option A is about seeming right but being illusory. That makes me think of something that just appears right but isn't actually. Whereas prima facie is more about being a genuine duty that may be overridden, not necessarily illusory.

So I think option B is the correct answer. Because it's about tending to be right, but other factors can outweigh it.

A prima facie duty refers to an act that, based on certain considerations, appears to be right or obligatory but may be overridden by other factors. The term "prima facie" means "at first glance" or "on the face of it," suggesting that the duty is apparent but not necessarily absolute. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** states that the act "seems to be right, although this might be illusory." While this captures the idea of appearance, it implies that the duty might be illusory, which is not the core concept of prima facie duties. Prima facie duties are genuine but may be outweighed, not necessarily illusory.

- **Option B** states that the act "tends to be right, although this might be outweighed by other considerations." This aligns with the concept of prima facie duties as introduced by W.D. Ross, where such duties are binding unless overridden by other duties. This option accurately reflects the characteristic of prima facie duties.

- **Option C** states that the act "is right." This describes an actual duty, not a prima facie duty, which may be overridden.

- **Option D** states that the act "is the first thing that an agent ought to do, above all else." This is incorrect because prima facie duties are not necessarily about priority but rather about apparent obligations that may be subject to override.

The most accurate description is **Option B**, as it captures the essence of prima facie duties as tendencies to be right that can be outweighed by other considerations.
