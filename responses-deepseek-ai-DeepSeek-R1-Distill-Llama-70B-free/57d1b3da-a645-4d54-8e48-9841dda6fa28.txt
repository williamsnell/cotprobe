Okay, so I have this question about the 1976 remake of King Kong and which New York landmark the giant ape climbs. Hmm, I remember that in the original King Kong from 1933, Kong climbs the Empire State Building. But this is about the remake, so I need to think about what changed.

Wait, I think in the 1976 version, they might have chosen a different building. I remember something about the World Trade Center. Oh right, because the Empire State Building was already iconic from the original, maybe they wanted a new location. Let me think... The World Trade Center was completed in the early 70s, so by 1976 it was a prominent landmark in New York.

So in the 1976 remake, King Kong climbs the World Trade Center instead of the Empire State Building. I think the answer is either H or A, since H is World Trade Center and A is One World Trade Center. Wait, One World Trade Center is the new building built after 9/11, right? So the 1976 version would have the Twin Towers, which were part of the original World Trade Center complex. So the correct answer would be H: World Trade Center.

I'm pretty sure that's right. So the options are H or A, but since One World wasn't around then, it's H.

The correct answer is H: World Trade Center.
