Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem for a series RLC circuit. Hmm, I remember that in RLC circuits, the behavior can either be overdamped, underdamped, or critically damped depending on the values of R, L, and C. The question is about finding the homogeneous solution for the voltage across the capacitor, v_C(t).

Let me jot down the given values. The capacitor is 4/3 Farads, so C = 4/3 F. The resistor R is 1 Ohm, and the inductor L is 1/4 Henry. The initial current through the inductor is i_L(0) = 4 A, and the initial voltage across the capacitor is v_C(0) = 0 V.

I think the first step is to set up the differential equation governing the circuit. Since it's a series RLC circuit, the current i(t) is the same through all components. The voltage across the capacitor is v_C(t) = (1/C) ∫ i(t) dt. And the voltage across the inductor is L di/dt. Oh wait, Kirchhoff's Voltage Law applies here: the sum of the voltages around the loop equals zero. So R*i(t) + L*di/dt + v_C(t) = 0.

But since v_C(t) is the integral of i(t) over C, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of i(t) or v_C(t). Let me think. Maybe expressing the equation in terms of the inductor current would be easier. So, substituting v_C(t), we get R*i + L*di/dt + (1/C)∫ i dt = 0.

Alternatively, I could express everything in terms of v_C(t). Let's see. The current i(t) is the derivative of the charge Q(t) on the capacitor, so i(t) = dQ/dt. But Q(t) is C*v_C(t), so i(t) = C * dv_C/dt. Then, di/dt would be C * d²v_C/dt².

Putting that back into the KVL equation: R * i(t) + L * di/dt + v_C(t) = 0. Substituting, R*C*(dv_C/dt) + L*C*(d²v_C/dt²) + v_C(t) = 0.

So the differential equation is L*C * v_C'' + R*C * v_C' + v_C = 0. Let me plug in the values: L is 1/4, C is 4/3. So L*C = (1/4)*(4/3) = 1/3. R*C = 1*(4/3) = 4/3.

So the equation becomes (1/3) v_C'' + (4/3) v_C' + v_C = 0. Multiply all terms by 3 to eliminate denominators: v_C'' + 4 v_C' + 3 v_C = 0.

Wait, wait. Or did I mess up the substitution? Let me double-check. Oh yes, R is 1, so R*C is correct. So the equation is correct: v_C'' +4 v_C' +3 v_C=0.

Now, to find the homogeneous solution, I need to solve the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for this DE is r^2 +4 r +3 =0. Solving for r, r = [-4 ± sqrt(16 -12)] / 2 = [-4 ± sqrt(4)] / 2 = (-4 ± 2)/2. So the roots are (-4+2)/2= -1 and (-4-2)/2= -3. 

So we have two real distinct roots, which means the circuit is overdamped. The general solution is v_C(t) = A e^(-t) + B e^(-3t), where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions.

Wait, but what are the initial conditions here? The problem states v_C(0) = 0 V. Also, I think we need the initial current or the derivative of v_C at t=0. Hmm, because the circuit is a series RLC, the inductor current and the capacitor voltage are related. Let me think about this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have expressed the DE in terms of the inductor current. Let me try that approach to see if I get the same equation.

Starting again, the KVL equation: R*i(t) + L di/dt + v_C(t) = 0. Since v_C is across the capacitor, v_C(t) = (1/C) ∫ i(t) dt. So substituting, R i + L di/dt + (1/C) ∫ i dt = 0.

But that's a bit messy because of the integral. Maybe differentiating the entire equation would help eliminate the integral. Let's differentiate both sides with respect to time. The derivative of R i is R di/dt. The derivative of L di/dt is L d²i/dt². The derivative of (1/C) ∫ i dt is (1/C) i(t). So putting it all together: R di/dt + L d²i/dt² + (1/C) i = 0.

So the differential equation in terms of i(t) is L i'' + R i' + (1/C) i = 0. Plugging in the values: L=1/4, R=1, C=4/3. So:

(1/4) i'' + (1) i' + (3/4) i = 0.

Multiply through by 4 to eliminate denominators: i'' +4 i' +3 i =0.

Same characteristic equation as before: r^2 +4r +3=0 → roots at r=-1 and r=-3. So the general solution for i(t) is i(t) = D e^(-t) + E e^(-3t), where D and E are constants.

Now, applying initial conditions for i(t). The initial current i(0) is given as 4A. So at t=0, i(0)=4 = D + E.

We also need another initial condition, which is the derivative of i at t=0. Let me compute i'(t) = -D e^(-t) -3 E e^(-3t). So i'(0) = -D -3 E.

But wait, what is i'(0)? Let me think. From the KVL equation, at t=0, the equation is R i(0) + L i'(0) + v_C(0) = 0. Wait, no, wait. The original KVL is R i + L di/dt + v_C =0. At t=0, i(0)=4, v_C(0)=0. So:

R i(0) + L i'(0) + v_C(0) =0 → 1*4 + (1/4) i'(0) + 0 =0 → 4 + (1/4) i'(0) =0 → (1/4) i'(0) = -4 → i'(0) = -16.

So from i'(0) = -D -3 E = -16.

We have two equations:

1. D + E =4

2. -D -3 E = -16 → D +3 E =16

Let's solve these equations. Subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (D +3E) - (D + E) =16-4 → 2E=12 → E=6.

Then from equation 1, D=4 -6= -2.

So i(t) = -2 e^(-t) +6 e^(-3t).

Wait, but this is the current. The question asks for the voltage across the capacitor, v_C(t). Since the current is i(t) = C dv_C/dt (because i is the derivative of charge, which is C v_C, so dv_C/dt = i/C), so integrating i(t) over C gives v_C(t).

Wait, no. Wait, v_C(t) = (1/C) ∫ i(t) dt + v_C(0). Because v_C is the integral of i over C. Since v_C(0) is 0, it's just (1/C) ∫ i(t) dt.

Alternatively, since i(t) = C dv_C/dt, we have dv_C/dt = (1/C) i(t). So to get v_C(t), we can integrate dv_C/dt from 0 to t.

So let's compute v_C(t):

v_C(t) = (1/C) ∫ i(t) dt from 0 to t.

C is 4/3, so 1/C is 3/4.

So,

v_C(t) = (3/4) ∫ [ -2 e^(-t) +6 e^(-3t) ] dt

Let me compute the integral:

∫ -2 e^(-t) dt = 2 e^(-t) + K1

∫6 e^(-3t) dt = -2 e^(-3t) + K2

So the integral becomes 2 e^(-t) -2 e^(-3t) + K, where K is the constant of integration.

But since we're integrating from 0 to t, the definite integral from 0 to t would be:

[2 e^(-t) -2 e^(-3t)] - [2 e^(0) -2 e^(0)] = [2 e^(-t) -2 e^(-3t)] - [2 -2] = 2 e^(-t) -2 e^(-3t).

Then multiply by 3/4:

v_C(t) = (3/4) [2 e^(-t) -2 e^(-3t)] = (3/4 * 2)(e^(-t) -e^(-3t)) ) = (3/2)(e^(-t) - e^(-3t)) V.

Let me check my steps again. So i(t) is the current, which is correctly found as -2 e^{-t} +6 e^{-3t}. Integrating i(t) over time gives the charge, and then v_C is charge divided by C, but wait, no—v_C is the integral of (i/C) because i = C dv_C/dt. So integrating i(t) gives C v_C(t), not v_C(t). So I think I might have made a mistake here.

Wait, let me correct that. If i(t) = C dv_C/dt, then dv_C/dt = i(t)/C. So integrating both sides from 0 to t:

v_C(t) - v_C(0) = ∫ (i(t)/C) dt from 0 to t.

Since v_C(0)=0, v_C(t) = (1/C) ∫ i(t) dt from 0 to t.

Yes, so that part was correct. Then, with C=4/3, 1/C=3/4.

So v_C(t) is (3/4) times the integral of i(t) dt. I(t) is (-2 e^{-t} +6 e^{-3t}), so integrating that gives [2 e^{-t} -2 e^{-3t}] evaluated from 0 to t.

Wait, no. Wait, the integral of -2 e^{-t} is 2 e^{-t} because ∫e^{-at} da = -e^{-at}/a. So yes, ∫-2 e^{-t} dt is 2 e^{-t} + K.

Similarly, ∫6 e^{-3t} dt is -2 e^{-3t} + K.

So definite integral from 0 to t would be [2 e^{-t} -2 e^{-3t} ] - [2 e^{0} -2 e^{0} ] = 2 e^{-t} -2 e^{-3t} - (2 -2) )= 2 e^{-t} -2 e^{-3t}.

Multiply by 3/4: (3/4)(2 e^{-t} -2 e^{-3t}) ) = (3/4)*2 [e^{-t} - e^{-3t} ] = (3/2)(e^{-t} -e^{-3t}) V.

So that's the expression for v_C(t). Let me look at the options. Option E is (3/2)(e^{-t} - e^{-3t}) V. So that's our solution.

Wait, but let me double-check the initial conditions to make sure. At t=0, v_C(0) should be 0. Plugging t=0 into the solution: (3/2)(1 -1 )=0. Correct.

What about the derivative, v_C’(t)? The derivative is (3/2)(-e^{-t} +3 e^{-3t} ). At t=0, this is (3/2)(-1 +3 )= (3/2)(2)=3. 

But from the current i(t), since i(t)= C dv_C/dt, so dv_C/dt = i(t)/C. At t=0, i(0)=4 A. So dv_C/dt(0) =4 / (4/3) )=3. Which matches. So that checks out.

So the correct answer is option E: (3/2)(e^-t - e^-3t)V.

To solve for the homogeneous solution of the voltage across the capacitor, \( v_C(t) \), in the given series RLC circuit, we start by deriving the governing differential equation. Using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), the equation is:

\[
Ri(t) + L \frac{di}{dt} + v_C(t) = 0
\]

where \( i(t) \) is the current through the circuit. Substituting \( v_C(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int i(t) \, dt \) and \( i(t) = C \frac{dv_C}{dt} \), the equation becomes:

\[
L \frac{d^2v_C}{dt^2} + R \frac{dv_C}{dt} + v_C = 0
\]

Plugging in the given values \( R = 1 \, \Omega \), \( L = \frac{1}{4} \, \text{H} \), and \( C = \frac{4}{3} \, \text{F} \), the differential equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \frac{d^2v_C}{dt^2} + \frac{4}{3} \frac{dv_C}{dt} + v_C = 0
\]

Multiplying through by 3 to simplify:

\[
\frac{d^2v_C}{dt^2} + 4 \frac{dv_C}{dt} + 3v_C = 0
\]

The characteristic equation for this differential equation is:

\[
r^2 + 4r + 3 = 0
\]

Solving for \( r \), we find:

\[
r = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 12}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 2}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = -1, -3
\]

Thus, the general solution for \( v_C(t) \) is:

\[
v_C(t) = A e^{-t} + B e^{-3t}
\]

To determine the constants \( A \) and \( B \), we use the initial conditions. The problem specifies \( v_C(0) = 0 \), which gives:

\[
v_C(0) = A + B = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad A = -B
\]

Additionally, the current \( i(t) \) is related to \( v_C(t) \) by \( i(t) = C \frac{dv_C}{dt} \). From the inductor equation, \( i_L(0) = 4 \, \text{A} \), so:

\[
i(0) = C \frac{dv_C}{dt}\bigg|_{t=0} = 4
\]

Substituting \( v_C(t) = A e^{-t} + B e^{-3t} \), we compute \( \frac{dv_C}{dt} \):

\[
\frac{dv_C}{dt} = -A e^{-t} - 3B e^{-3t}
\]

At \( t = 0 \):

\[
\frac{dv_C}{dt}\bigg|_{t=0} = -A - 3B
\]

Using \( i(0) = 4 \) and \( C = \frac{4}{3} \):

\[
\frac{4}{3} (-A - 3B) = 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad -A - 3B = 3
\]

From \( A = -B \), substituting into \( -A - 3B = 3 \):

\[
B - 3B = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad -2B = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad B = -\frac{3}{2}
\]

Thus, \( A = -B = \frac{3}{2} \). Substituting \( A \) and \( B \) into the general solution:

\[
v_C(t) = \frac{3}{2} e^{-t} - \frac{3}{2} e^{-3t} = \frac{3}{2} \left( e^{-t} - e^{-3t} \right)
\]

This matches option **E**. Verifying the initial conditions confirms the solution is correct.

**Answer: E**
