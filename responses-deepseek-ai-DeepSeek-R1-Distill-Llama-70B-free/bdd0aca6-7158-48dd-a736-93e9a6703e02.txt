Question:

Mary Anne, a piece-worker, makes 370 units each day. A consultant advises that a change in her method would result in 30% more units. Assuming the change really has this result, how many units should Mary Anne produce?

Options:

A: 470 units
B: 485 units
C: 430 units
D: 391 units
E: 451 units
F: 410 units
G: 481 units
H: 520 units
I: 444 units
J: 500 units

Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. Mary Anne makes 370 units each day. A consultant says that changing her method would result in 30% more units. The question is, how many units should she produce after this change?

Hmm, right. So I remember that percentage increase means you take the original amount and add a certain percentage of it. So like, if something increases by 30%, you're adding 30% of the original to itself.

Mary Anne's current production is 370 units. The consultant is saying she can produce 30% more. So I need to calculate 30% of 370 and then add that to 370.

Let me think about how to compute 30% of 370. Percentages can sometimes trip me up, but I think 30% is the same as 0.3 in decimal. So 0.3 multiplied by 370 should give me the increase.

Let me do that calculation. 0.3 times 370. Let's break it down: 0.3 times 300 is 90, and 0.3 times 70 is 21. So adding those together, 90 + 21 is 111. So the increase is 111 units.

Wait, wait, let me check that again. 370 times 0.3. Another way: 370 × 3 is 1110, and since 0.3 is a tenth of 3, I divide 1110 by 10, which gives 111. Yeah, that checks out.

So the increase is 111 units. Now, I add that to the original 370. 370 plus 111 equals 481. So Mary Anne should produce 481 units after the change.

Looking at the options, option G is 481 units. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recalculate 30% of 370. 10% of 370 is 37, so 30% is 3 times that, which is 37 × 3. 37 × 3 is 111. Yep, same result. Then 370 + 111 is 481. So yes, option G.

To determine how many units Mary Anne should produce after a 30% increase, calculate 30% of her current production (370 units) and add it to the original amount.

1. Calculate 30% of 370:  
   \( 0.3 \times 370 = 111 \).  
2. Add the increase to the original amount:  
   \( 370 + 111 = 481 \).  

Thus, Mary Anne should produce **481 units**. The correct answer is **G**.
