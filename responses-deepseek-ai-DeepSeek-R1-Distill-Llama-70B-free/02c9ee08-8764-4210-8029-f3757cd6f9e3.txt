Okay, so I have this question about how the royal cemeteries of the Moche were discovered. I'm not super familiar with Moche history, but I remember they were a civilization in Peru, right? I think they predated the Inca Empire. Anyway, the question is about the discovery of their cemeteries.

Looking at the options, there are several possibilities. Let me try to recall any information I might have come across before. I think the Moche are known for their pottery and maybe some burial sites. I remember something about a place called Sipán? Wasn't that a major discovery?

Wait, I think the Sipán site was where they found a lot of tombs, including that of the Lord of Sipán, which was a big deal because it was so well-preserved and had a lot of artifacts. How was that site found? I'm pretty sure it wasn't through looting, though I think some looting might have happened before the archaeologists got there. I don't think it was a forest fire or an earthquake that exposed it. Maybe it was discovered by accident?

Option F says a local farmer found it while tilling his field. That sounds plausible because a lot of archaeological sites are discovered by locals during their daily activities. Or maybe it was during construction, like option J. I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, option B suggests thieves were caught, but I think the discovery was more of an archaeological effort, maybe led by experts. Option I says it was an expedition funded by the government. That could be it, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think the Sipán discovery was made by archaeologists, but how did they know where to look? I'm trying to remember. Maybe it was due to local legends, which would point to option G. But I'm not sure if that was the case.

Another thought: I've heard that the Moche cemeteries were found after looters had already started digging. So perhaps the police caught the thieves, leading to the site's discovery. That would be option B. But I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, I think the discovery was more of an intentional archaeological project. So maybe option I is correct. But I'm a bit confused. Let me try to piece it together.

I remember that in the 1980s, a Peruvian archaeologist named Walter Alva was involved in excavations at Sipán. I think he was part of a team that started investigating after hearing about looting in the area. So maybe the tombs were found because of looters, but the actual discovery by archaeologists came after that. So perhaps the initial discovery was by looters, but the excavation was done later.

Wait, the question is about how the cemeteries were discovered, not how the excavation started. So if the looters were raiding the tombs and were caught by police, that led to the discovery by authorities and then archaeologists. So option B would be the answer. But I'm not entirely confident because I'm mixing up the events a bit.

Alternatively, maybe it was a local farmer who stumbled upon it, which is a common scenario. So option F could be correct. But I think the more accurate reason is that the site was found due to looting activity, and then archaeologists took over. So the discovery was because the thieves were caught, which would make option B the right choice.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I think the initial discovery was by looters, but the cemeteries as a whole were formally discovered by archaeologists after that. So the answer might be I, an expedition. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Another angle: The Moche cemeteries were found in the 1980s, and I think it was a result of systematic archaeological research. So perhaps option I is correct. Or maybe it was during construction, like building a road or something, which would be option J.

I'm a bit torn between B and I. Let me try to recall more details. I think the Lord of Sipán was discovered after looters had already dug into the site, leading to the authorities getting involved. So the actual exposure of the tombs was due to the looters, but the organized excavation was done by archaeologists. So the cemeteries were discovered because the thieves were caught, which is option B.

But I'm not 100% certain. Another possibility is that it was a government-funded expedition, so option I. But I'm leaning more towards B because the looting activity is what brought it to light.

The Moche civilization, known for its pottery and significant burial sites, had its royal cemeteries discovered under circumstances tied to looting activity. The site of Sipán, where the Lord of Sipán was found, became known after looters began digging, leading to police intervention. Archaeologists, including Walter Alva, subsequently conducted formal excavations. While the cemeteries were initially exposed by looters, the discovery in an archaeological context came after authorities caught the thieves, making option B the most accurate.

Answer: B
