Okay, so I have this accounting question about lease accounting, specifically regarding when a company should start recognizing rental expenses for an operating lease. Hmm, I remember that operating leases are treated differently than capital leases. In an operating lease, the lessee doesn't recognize the asset on their balance sheet; instead, they just expense the rent over the lease term.

The question says that the company enters into an operating lease on January 1. But they receive control of the property to make leasehold improvements. So, they're probably going to make some changes or improvements before moving in. Then, they start the alterations on March 1 and move in on May 1. The rental payments start on July 1.

Wait, but when does the rental expense recognition begin? I think it's based on when the lessee has control of the asset. So, under the new lease accounting standards, like ASC 842, the lessee recognizes the lease as an asset and a liability when they have the right to control the use of the asset. So control is key here.

So in this case, the company got control on January 1, right? Because that's when the lease was entered into and they received control to make improvements. So even though they're making alterations, they already control the asset. So the lease term, for accounting purposes, starts when control is obtained, not when the payments begin or when they move in.

Wait, but I might be mixing up the start of the lease term and when rent is expensed. Because sometimes, if the lessee makes improvements before occupying, maybe there's a period where they're not using the asset yet. But in operating leases, I think the rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, starting from when the lessee takes control, regardless of when they start using it.

So in this case, the lease terms probably specify that the company has control starting Jan 1. So the company should start recognizing rent expense from that point. But wait, the cash payments start in July. But the expense isn't necessarily tied to the cash payments. For operating leases, the expense is recognized as incurred, which is typically when the lessee is using the asset. But if they have control, they might be responsible for the rent even if they aren't using it yet.

Wait, but in this scenario, the company is making leasehold improvements. So maybe from January 1 to June 30, the company is preparing the property. They might not be using it during that time. So when should the expense begin?

I remember that in some cases, if the lessee is required to make improvements before moving in, the period when the improvements are being made is part of the lease term, and they should start expensing then. Or maybe not? Because the company hasn't started using it yet.

Alternatively, another angle: The rent payments start in July, so the company might not have any obligation until then. But no, the lease is an operating lease, and under ASC 842, the lessee should recognize the lease when control is obtained, regardless of when payments start.

Wait, maybe the lease's commencement date is when the lessee has control, which is Jan 1. So the lease term for accounting purposes starts then. So the company should start expensing in January, even if they're just making improvements. Because they have the right to use the asset, even if they're not yet occupying it.

Alternatively, perhaps the recognition begins when the company actually starts using the space, which is May 1. But I'm not sure. Because the company has control, so maybe even if it's not being used, the expense should be recognized.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about the rules again. ASC 842 states that the commencement date is when the lessee has the right to use the underlying asset. So even if they're making improvements, as long as the lessee is controlling the asset, the lease starts.

So in this case, the company received control on Jan 1, so the lease commences then. Therefore, the recognition of the rental expense should begin in January.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: The company is making leasehold improvements. So perhaps during the period before moving in, the company is not yet using the office. In that case, should the expense be recognized only when the company starts using it, which is May?

But I think the key is control, not usage. So if the company has control, even if they're making improvements, the lease term starts. So the expense should begin in January.

But looking at the options, option C is January. So that might be the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe the rent is not being paid yet. The payments begin in July. So the rental payments are from July onwards. But for an operating lease, the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis regardless of the payment terms. So if the lease started in January, the company should start expensing in January, even if the payments are not due until later.

But another possibility: the lease is considered to start when the company has the right to use the asset for its intended purpose. So if they can't use it until after the improvements, maybe the start date is when the improvements are done, which would be May 1. But I'm not sure. The company took control in January, so perhaps they could have used it as is, but they chose to make improvements before moving in.

So in that case, the lease term starts in January, so the expense begins in January.

Wait, but the company starts alterations in March and moves in May. So from January to March, they might have had control but weren't doing anything. So maybe the rent should be expensed from January.

So the correct answer would be C: January.

Under ASC 842, the recognition of rental expense for an operating lease begins when the lessee obtains control of the underlying asset, which is the commencement date of the lease. In this scenario, the company enters into the operating lease on January 1 and receives control of the property to make leasehold improvements. Although the company begins alterations on March 1 and moves in on May 1, the key factor is that control was transferred on January 1. 

The recognition of rental expense is not dependent on when the company starts using the asset or when payments begin (July 1 in this case). Instead, it is tied to when the lessee has the right to control the use of the asset. Therefore, the company should start recognizing rental expense in January, even though it is making improvements and not yet occupying the space.

Options like May or July might seem plausible if one focuses on the move-in date or the start of payments, but the correct approach under the standard is to recognize expense from the commencement date when control is obtained. Thus, the correct answer is:

C: January.
