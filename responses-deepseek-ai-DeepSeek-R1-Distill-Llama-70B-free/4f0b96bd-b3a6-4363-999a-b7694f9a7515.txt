Question:

A state labor code provided that no employer in the state shall knowingly employ an alien who is not lawfully residing in the United States if such employment would have an adverse effect on lawful residents' right to work. A group of immigrant farm workers were continually refused employment contracts by the labor contractors in the state. Instead, the labor contractors had employed many alien workers since they would toil longer hours for less wages. The immigrant farm workers now bring suit in state court pursuant to the above-mentioned statutory provision. Which of the following determinations would most likely result as a consequence of the immigrant farm workers' lawsuit?

Options:

A: The court would declare the statute unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
B: The court would declare the statute unconstitutional as it violates the rights of the alien workers.
C: The court would declare the statute constitutional since it is within the state's power to regulate employment.
D: The court would declare the statute constitutional as within the realm of rights reserved to the states by the Eleventh Amendment.
E: The court would declare the statute unconstitutional as it discriminates against non-residents.
F: The court would declare the statute unconstitutional as it conflicts with federal labor laws.
G: The court would declare the statute constitutional as it does not infringe on the rights of the immigrant workers.
H: The court would declare the statute constitutional as it promotes the welfare of the state's residents.
I: The court would declare the statute constitutional since the states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens.

Okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with state labor codes and the Fourteenth Amendment. Let me break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is that a state has a labor code which says employers can't knowingly hire aliens not lawfully residing in the US if it adversely affects lawful residents' right to work. Some immigrant farm workers are suing because labor contractors won't hire them, choosing instead to hire alien workers who work longer for less pay.

The question is asking what the court would most likely decide about the constitutionality of this statute. The options are from A to I, each suggesting a different outcome.

First, I need to recall relevant legal principles. The key here is probably the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the statute treats different groups (lawful residents vs. unlawful aliens) differently. Also, there's the issue of preemption by federal law, which often comes into play with immigration and labor matters.

I remember that states can't pass laws that conflict with federal immigration policies. Federal law preempts state laws in areas like immigration, so if the state is regulating something that's under federal authority, the state law might be invalid. However, states can sometimes regulate in areas like employment, especially regarding illegal aliens, as there might be concurrent jurisdiction.

Another point is the Supreme Court case Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting, which I think held that Arizona's law requiring employers to verify the immigration status of employees through E-Verify and imposing sanctions was not preempted by federal law because it fell under the state's authority to regulate employment. So states can impose sanctions on employers who hire unauthorized aliens without conflicting with federal law.

Wait, but in this question, the state law is about refusing to hire lawful residents if it affects their right to work, which might be a different angle. The law seems to protect lawful residents by preventing employers from hiring aliens when it's adverse. But the issue is whether this violates equal protection or discriminates against the aliens.

The Equal Protection Clause requires that similarly situated individuals be treated equally. If the state is treating lawful residents and unlawful aliens differently, does that violate equal protection? I think the Supreme Court has held that states can treat lawful and unlawful residents differently because unlawful presence is a valid distinction. For example, in Plyler v. Doe, the court held that Texas couldn't deny education to undocumented children, but that was about children and education, not employment.

Wait, in the context of employment, the court might be more lenient with state laws. Also, in the case of De Canas v. Bica (1976), the Supreme Court struck down a state law that prohibited the employment of illegal aliens, holding it was preempted by federal law. But later cases, like Whiting, seemed to allow some state regulation as long as it complements federal law.

Wait, De Canas was decided before the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986, which made it a federal crime to hire unauthorized aliens. Then, in Whiting, the Court upheld Arizona's law as not preempted because it was using licensing sanctions, which were allowed as a state action. So, perhaps the state can impose such restrictions.

But wait, the statute in question here says employers can't hire aliens not lawfully residing in the US if it would adversely affect lawful residents' right to work. So it's a bit different because it's not a blanket prohibition but conditional on affecting lawful residents. But I'm not sure if that makes a difference in terms of constitutionality.

Looking at the options, option C says the court would find the statute constitutional because it's within the state's power to regulate employment. Option I says the states aren't preempted in regulating economic aspects of illegal aliens. Option A says it's unconstitutional under equal protection.

So, the key issues are preemption and equal protection. If the state's law is not preempted by federal law and doesn't violate equal protection, then it's constitutional.

In Whiting, the Court allowed Arizona's law, which required E-Verify and imposed penalties, so that suggests that state laws in this area can be upheld. So perhaps the state's law here is constitutional under that precedent.

But wait, De Canas was about California's law, and the Court there said that states can't impose such sanctions because it's a federal area. But then, after IRCA, and with Whiting, the position might have changed. So maybe now, states have more leeway.

Alternatively, if the state law is more restrictive than federal law, it could be preempted. But if it's complementary, it's allowed.

Another angle: the statute might be seen as discriminating against aliens, which could implicate equal protection. But the Equal Protection Clause applies to states, and aliens are protected, but the state can treat them differently if there's a substantial state interest and the law is narrowly tailored.

In this case, the state's interest is protecting lawful residents' right to work, which seems substantial. The law is tailored to only apply when employment would have an adverse effect, so perhaps it's narrowly tailored.

So, the court might find that the statute doesn't violate equal protection because the distinction is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Alternatively, if it's a suspect classification, but I don't think alienage is a suspect class anymore, but I'm not certain. Wait, in Bernal v. Fainter, the Supreme Court held that laws discriminating based on alienage are subject to strict scrutiny unless they involve areas of federal exclusivity, like immigration.

So, if the law discriminates based on alienage, it's subject to strict scrutiny, meaning the state must have a compelling interest and the law must be narrowly tailored.

In this case, the state's interest is protecting lawful residents' jobs. Is that compelling? It's a strong interest, but I'm not sure if it's compelling enough to pass strict scrutiny. Alternatively, the law might be seen as a legitimate regulation of employment, not necessarily discriminating against aliens, but rather protecting residents.

Wait, but the statute is about not hiring aliens if it affects lawful residents. So it's a form of protectionism for residents. The question is whether this is permissible under the Equal Protection Clause.

In the case of United States v. Guest, the Court held that the Equal Protection Clause applies to aliens. But in the context of employment, states have sometimes been allowed to prefer citizens or lawful residents.

Wait, in the case of Foley v. Connelie, the Supreme Court upheld a state law that gave a hiring preference to state residents for public jobs, but that was about residency, not alienage. So residency preferences have been allowed, but what about alienage?

If the state is preferring lawful residents over aliens, that's a different distinction. The issue is whether the law violates equal protection by discriminating against aliens.

If strict scrutiny applies, the state must show a compelling interest. Protecting jobs for lawful residents could be seen as a compelling interest. But is the statute narrowly tailored? It applies only when hiring the alien would have an adverse effect on lawful residents, so perhaps it's tailored.

Alternatively, the Court might find that the law is preempted by federal immigration laws because it's regulating employment of aliens, which is a federal matter. But as in Whiting, the state can impose sanctions that complement federal law.

Wait, but De Canas was about a state law that prohibited employment, which the Court struck down as preempted. But that was before IRCA, which created a federal framework for employer sanctions. So after IRCA, states can impose their own sanctions as long as they don't conflict with federal law.

In Whiting, Arizona's law requiring E-Verify and imposing license revocation was upheld. So the Court said that as long as the state law is consistent with federal law, it's not preempted. Therefore, the state's statute here might be constitutional under that reasoning.

Looking at the options, option I says that states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens. That would align with the Whiting decision.

Option C says the court would declare the statute constitutional as within state power to regulate employment. That could also be a possibility, but it's a bit broader.

Option H says the statute is constitutional because it promotes the welfare of the state's residents. While that's a possible rationale, the more precise legal reasoning would be about preemption and equal protection.

So, considering all this, the court would likely find the statute constitutional because it's within the state's power and not preempted by federal law. Therefore, the correct answer is either C or I.

Wait, but option I specifically mentions that states are not preempted in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens. That seems to directly address the preemption issue, which I think is the main concern here.

In the scenario, the state is regulating economic activity (employment) regarding illegal aliens. Since Whiting allows such state regulation as long as it doesn't conflict with federal law, the court would likely hold that the state isn't preempted. So option I would be correct.

Alternatively, option C is about the state's power to regulate employment, which is a broader statement. But if the issue is preemption, then I is more accurate.

So, I think the answer is I.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of a state labor code that prohibits employers from hiring aliens not lawfully residing in the United States if it adversely affects lawful residents' right to work. The analysis focuses on two key legal principles: (1) whether the statute violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against aliens and (2) whether the statute is preempted by federal immigration and labor laws.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Equal Protection Clause**:
   - The statute treats lawful residents and unlawful aliens differently, raising concerns under the Equal Protection Clause. However, states are generally allowed to treat lawful and unlawful aliens differently if the distinction is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.
   - The state's interest in protecting lawful residents' right to work is substantial. The statute is tailored to apply only when hiring aliens would adversely affect lawful residents, which suggests it is narrowly tailored to achieve this interest.

2. **Preemption by Federal Law**:
   - Federal law preempts state laws that conflict with federal immigration policies. However, states have been allowed to regulate employment of unauthorized aliens as long as their laws complement federal law.
   - Relevant precedent includes *Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting*, where the Supreme Court upheld Arizona's law requiring E-Verify and imposing sanctions on employers of unauthorized aliens. This suggests that states can regulate in this area without conflicting with federal law.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Unlikely, as the statute does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The distinction between lawful residents and unlawful aliens is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect, as the statute does not violate the rights of alien workers; it is a lawful exercise of state authority.
   - **Option C**: Plausible, as states have the power to regulate employment, but it is broader and does not address preemption.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect, as the Eleventh Amendment is irrelevant to this issue.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect, as the statute does not discriminate against non-residents, but rather unlawful aliens.
   - **Option F**: Unlikely, as the statute does not conflict with federal labor laws.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect, as the statute does infringe on the rights of alien workers, but this infringement is permissible under the law.
   - **Option H**: Plausible, but less precise than other options. The statute promotes the welfare of lawful residents, but the legal reasoning focuses on preemption and equal protection.
   - **Option I**: Most accurate, as it directly addresses preemption and aligns with *Whiting*, where states are allowed to regulate economic activity related to illegal aliens without conflicting with federal law.

### Conclusion:
The court would most likely declare the statute constitutional because it is within the realm of rights reserved to the states in the area of economic regulation of illegal aliens, as supported by *Whiting*. The correct answer is:

**I**

Answer: I
