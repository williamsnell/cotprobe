Okay, so I've got this question about Piaget and his theories on children. Hmm, I remember Piaget was a developmental psychologist who focused on how children think and learn. I think his theory is called cognitive development, something like that. 

The question is asking, according to Piaget, children are __________. The options are A through J. Let me think about what I know about Piaget. I recall he proposed that children go through different stages of development, like sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. Each stage has its own way of thinking.

Wait, the question is about how Piaget views children. I think he didn't see them as just passive recipients of information. Oh right, he believed they are active constructors of their own knowledge. So, they aren't just "blank slates" waiting for the environment to shape them. That's more like the behaviorist view, maybe Locke's tabula rasa idea.

So looking at the options, B says "Blank slates"—that's probably not Piaget. Because Piaget's view is more about active construction. I think he called them something like little scientists because they experiment and construct their understanding through experiences.

Looking at the options, D is "Little scientists". That sounds right. Or wait, was it "little philosophers"? No, I think "little scientists" fits better because it's about actively exploring and constructing knowledge, like experimenting and testing ideas.

Other options: A says they can't learn complex concepts—probably not, because Piaget's stages show that they develop the ability over time. C is "Little artists"—I don't remember that being part of Piaget's terms. E is philosophers, maybe that's more like someone else's theory, like maybe in another context. 

F says shaped by environment only—no, because Piaget's theory is about interaction between the child and environment, not just environment. G is shaped by culture—that's more Vygotsky's sociocultural theory. H says less intelligent than adults—that's too simplistic; Piaget's stages show different kinds of thinking, not just less intelligent. I says just smaller adults—that's the opposite of what Piaget said, he believed children think differently, not just less efficiently. J says influenced by genetics only—no, Piaget's stages are about maturation and interaction with environment, not just genetics.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: "Little scientists".

According to Jean Piaget, children are viewed as active constructors of their own knowledge, engaging with their environment to build understanding through experiences and experimentation. This aligns with the idea of children as "Little scientists," as they explore and test ideas. 

Answer: D
