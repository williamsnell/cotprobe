Question:

When a person invents a new product, he is often granted a patent which is intended to protect his idea from being stolen by others. Explain how the issuance of patents fosters the growth of monopoly.

Options:

A: Patents have no effect on monopoly.
B: Patents are awarded to multiple inventors for the same idea, fostering competition rather than monopoly.
C: Patents ensure that only government-owned companies can become monopolies.
D: Patents grant exclusive rights for a short period, after which a monopoly is impossible.
E: Patents allow for an unlimited number of competitors, preventing any form of monopoly.
F: Patents hinder the growth of a monopoly.
G: Patents require the inventor to share the idea with the public, which leads to increased competition and no monopoly.
H: Patents always lead to monopoly.
I: A patent, as a barrier to entry, may cause a monopoly to arise.
J: Patents provide temporary monopoly rights which can be easily bypassed by competitors.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about how patents foster the growth of monopoly. Let me start by understanding what each part means.

First, the question says that when someone invents a new product, they might get a patent. The purpose of a patent is to protect their idea from being stolen. So, the patent gives them exclusive rights over their invention for a certain period.

Now, the question is asking how this issuance of patents leads to monopoly growth. I remember that monopoly refers to a market structure where a single company supplies the entire market with a particular product, so there's no competition.

So, if a person gets a patent, they have exclusive rights. That means no one else can make, use, or sell that invention without their permission. This would prevent others from entering the market with the same product, right? Because if someone else tries to make the same thing, they could get sued for infringing on the patent.

Wait, but isn't a monopoly bad because it can lead to higher prices and less innovation since there's no competition? But the question isn't about the pros and cons; it's about how patents cause monopoly.

So, the key here is the exclusivity provided by the patent. If only one company can produce the patented product, that company has a monopoly in that market. This creates a barrier to entry for other companies because they can't legally enter without permission, which the patent holder can deny.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says patents have no effect on monopoly. That doesn't seem right because I just thought that patents do create exclusivity, which can lead to monopoly.

Option B says patents are awarded to multiple inventors for the same idea, fostering competition. Wait, no, I think patents are granted to the first inventor, so others can't use it without permission. So B is incorrect.

Option C says only government-owned companies can become monopolies with patents. I don't think that's the case. Private companies can certainly get patents and become monopolies.

Option D: Patents grant exclusive rights for a short period, after which a monopoly is impossible. Hmm, well the monopoly exists during the patent term. After it expires, others can enter, so yes, the monopoly is temporary. But the question is about how patents foster growth, so during the period, it does create a monopoly.

Option E: Patents allow unlimited competitors, preventing monopoly. No, that's the opposite. Patents limit competition because others can't enter.

Option F: Patents hinder monopoly growth. No, that's the opposite of what the question suggests.

Option G: Patents require sharing the idea, leading to competition. Well, yes, patents do require the inventor to disclose the invention, but during the patent term, others can't use it without permission, so it's not leading to competition during that time.

Option H: Patents always lead to monopoly. I'm not sure. Sometimes, maybe, but not always. For example, if the invention isn't widely used, maybe the patent doesn't create a monopoly. So H might be too absolute.

Option I: A patent, as a barrier to entry, may cause a monopoly. This makes sense. The barrier prevents others from entering, leading to a single seller.

Option J: Patents provide temporary rights which can be easily bypassed. If they're easily bypassed, then the monopoly wouldn't be effective. So J doesn't seem right.

So, putting it together: The correct answer should be I. Because the patent acts as a barrier to entry, preventing others from producing the same product, which can lead to a monopoly situation.

The issuance of patents grants inventors exclusive rights to their creations, preventing others from producing, using, or selling the invention without permission. This exclusivity acts as a barrier to entry, stopping competitors from entering the market with the same product. As a result, the patent holder can become the sole supplier of that product, leading to a monopoly. While the monopoly is temporary and ends when the patent expires, during the patent term, it effectively fosters the growth of monopoly by limiting competition.

The correct answer is:

I: A patent, as a barrier to entry, may cause a monopoly to arise.

Answer: I
