Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the mean salary of office assistants in a company with two offices. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem gives me two offices: one in New Jersey and one in Utah. Each has their own mean salary. New Jersey's mean is $28,500, and Utah's is $22,500. The number of assistants in each office is different too—128 in NJ and 32 in Utah.

I'm trying to find the overall mean salary for all the office assistants in the company. Hmm, I remember that mean is calculated by adding up all the values and then dividing by the number of values. But since there are two groups here, I probably need to find the total salary for each office and then combine them.

Wait, so the formula for the overall mean (μ) would be the total sum of all salaries divided by the total number of employees. So, I can't just average the two means because each office has a different number of people. That makes sense because if one office has more employees, its mean will have a bigger impact on the overall average.

Let me think about the steps. First, calculate the total salary for New Jersey. That would be the mean salary there multiplied by the number of employees. So 28,500 times 128. Then do the same for Utah: 22,500 times 32. Add those two totals together to get the combined total salary. Then add the number of employees in both offices for the total number. Finally, divide the total salary by that total number to get the mean.

Let me do the calculations. 

For New Jersey:
28,500 * 128. Let me compute that. 28,500 * 100 is 2,850,000. 28,500 * 28 is... 28,500 * 20 is 570,000, and 28,500 *8 is 228,000. So 570k + 228k is 798,000. So total for NJ is 2,850,000 + 798,000 = 3,648,000.

Wait wait, wait. 128 is 100 + 28. So 28,500 * 128 = 28,500*(100+28) = 28,500*100 + 28,500*28.

28,500 *100 is 2,850,000. 28,500 *28: 28,500 *20 is 570,000 and 28,500 *8 is 228,000. So 570k + 228k is 798,000. So total is 2,850k + 798k = 3,648,000. Yeah, that's correct.

For Utah: 22,500 *32. Let's compute that. 22,500 times 30 is 675,000, and 22,500 times 2 is 45,000. So 675k +45k =720,000.

Now, add the two totals: 3,648,000 +720,000 = 4,368,000.

Total number of employees is 128 +32 = 160.

So the overall mean is 4,368,000 divided by 160.

Let me compute that division. 4,368,000 ÷160.

Hmm, let's simplify this. 160 is 16*10, so maybe divide by 10 first: 436,800. Then divide by 16.

436,800 ÷16. Let's see:

16 * 27,000 = 432,000. Because 16*27k is 432k.

Subtracting 432,000 from 436,800 leaves 4,800.

Now, 16 * 300 =4,800. So 27,000 +300 =27,300.

So the overall mean is $27,300.

Wait, but looking at the options, H is $27,300. So the answer should be H.

Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

New Jersey: 128 *28500: 128*28500. Let me compute 128 *28,500.

Alternatively, 28,500 *128 is the same as 28,500*(130-2) = 28,500*130 -28,500*2.

28,500 * 100 =2,850,000; 28,500 *30= 855,000. So 2,850k +855k= 3,705,000. Then subtract 57,000 (28,500*2=57,000). So 3,705,000 -57,000 =3,648,000. Correct.

Utah:32 *22,500=720,000. Correct.

Total salary: 3,648k +720k=4,368,000. Divided by 160.

4,368,000 ÷160: Let me try another approach. Divide numerator and denominator by 16.

4,368,000 ÷16 = 273,000.

160 ÷16=10.

So now it's 273,000 ÷10 =27,300. Yep, same result.

So the mean is $27,300, which is option H. So the answer is H.

To calculate the mean salary paid to office assistants in the company, we need to find the overall mean by combining the data from both offices. The formula for the overall mean is:

\[
\text{Overall Mean} = \frac{\text{Total Salary of All Employees}}{\text{Total Number of Employees}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate Total Salary for Each Office
- **New Jersey Office**:  
  Mean salary = $28,500, Number of employees = 128  
  Total salary = \( 28,500 \times 128 = 3,648,000 \)

- **Utah Office**:  
  Mean salary = $22,500, Number of employees = 32  
  Total salary = \( 22,500 \times 32 = 720,000 \)

### Step 2: Combine the Data
- **Total Salary**:  
  \( 3,648,000 + 720,000 = 4,368,000 \)

- **Total Number of Employees**:  
  \( 128 + 32 = 160 \)

### Step 3: Calculate the Overall Mean
\[
\text{Overall Mean} = \frac{4,368,000}{160} = 27,300
\]

### Final Answer
The mean salary paid to office assistants in the company is **$27,300**, which corresponds to option **H**.
