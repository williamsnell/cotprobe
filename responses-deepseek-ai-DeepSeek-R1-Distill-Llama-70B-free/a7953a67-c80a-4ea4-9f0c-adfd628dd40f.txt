Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the ionization constant, Ka, for a weak monoprotic acid. Hmm, I remember that Ka is a measure of the strength of an acid. Monoprotic means it donates one proton, right?

The problem says the solution is 0.060 molar and has a pH of 2.0. Wait, pH is the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration. So if pH is 2, then [H+] must be 10^-2 M. Because pH = -log[H+], so 10^-pH gives [H+]. So [H+] is 0.01 M.

But wait, since this is a weak acid, it doesn't completely dissociate. So the concentration of H+ ions comes from the dissociation of the acid. Let's think about the dissociation. For a weak monoprotic acid HA, the dissociation is HA ↔ H+ + A-.

At initial concentration, before dissociation, we have 0.060 M HA and 0 H+ and A-. Let's let x be the concentration that dissociates. So at equilibrium:

HA: 0.060 - x
H+: x (since it's monoprotic)
A-: x

But wait, in reality, for weak acids, x is much smaller than the initial concentration, so we can approximate 0.060 - x ≈ 0.060. But I'm not sure if that's a good assumption here. Let me see. If the pH is 2, then [H+] is 0.01, so x is 0.01. So 0.060 - 0.01 = 0.05. Oh wait, that's not negligible because 0.01 is about 16% of 0.06. Hmm, maybe I can't ignore x. So maybe I should write the exact expression.

The expression for Ka is [H+][A-]/[HA]. So substituting, that's (x^2)/(0.060 - x).

We know that x is 0.01 because [H+] is 0.01. So plugging in:

Ka = (0.01^2) / (0.06 - 0.01) = (0.0001) / (0.05) = 0.002. Wait, that's 2e-3. Let's see the options. Option B is 2.0e-3, H is 5e-3, J is 4e-3. Wait, wait, did I do that right?

Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate. 0.01 squared is 0.0001. Divided by 0.05 is 0.0001 / 0.05. Let's see, 0.0001 is 1e-4, 0.05 is 5e-2. So 1e-4 / 5e-2 = (1/5) * 1e-2 = 0.2e-2 = 2e-3. So yes, that's 2.0e-3. So that would be option B.

Wait, but wait a second. I thought that for weak acids, if the dissociation is significant compared to the initial concentration, the approximation isn't valid. But in this case, when I didn't make the approximation, I still got Ka as 2e-3. But maybe I should double-check if the assumption that x is small is not valid here. So let's think: initial concentration is 0.06, and x is 0.01. So 0.01 is about 16.6% of 0.06, which is more than 5%, so the approximation might not hold. Therefore, using x without approximation is better, which is what I did.

So the calculation leads me to Ka = 2e-3, which is option B. But wait, let me look at the options again. Option B is 2.0e-3. So that's the choice.

Alternatively, let me think if I made any mistake. Oh wait, could the solution have activity coefficients or something? No, I think in this level of problem, it's assumed to be ideal, so no. So I think the answer is B.

To determine the ionization constant, \( K_a \), for a weak monoprotic acid, we start with the given data: a 0.060 M solution of the acid has a pH of 2.0. The pH is related to the hydrogen ion concentration \([H^+]\) by the equation:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[H^+]
\]

Thus, \([H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-2.0} = 0.01 \, \text{M}\).

For a weak monoprotic acid, the dissociation can be represented as:

\[
\text{HA} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{A}^-
\]

Let the initial concentration of the acid be 0.060 M. At equilibrium:
- The concentration of \(\text{HA}\) is \( 0.060 - x \),
- The concentrations of \(\text{H}^+\) and \(\text{A}^-\) are both \( x \).

Since \([H^+] = 0.01 \, \text{M}\), we have \( x = 0.01 \). Substituting into the equilibrium expression for \( K_a \):

\[
K_a = \frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]} = \frac{x^2}{0.060 - x}
\]

Substituting \( x = 0.01 \):

\[
K_a = \frac{(0.01)^2}{0.060 - 0.01} = \frac{0.0001}{0.05} = 0.002 = 2.0 \times 10^{-3}
\]

Thus, the ionization constant \( K_a \) is \( 2.0 \times 10^{-3} \).

From the given options:
- Option B corresponds to \( 2.0 \times 10^{-3} \), which matches the calculated value.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B**
