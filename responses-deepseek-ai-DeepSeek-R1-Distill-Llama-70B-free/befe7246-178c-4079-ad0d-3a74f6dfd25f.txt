Okay, so I have this question about excise taxes and how the burden falls on consumers. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which scenario makes consumers pay the largest burden of an excise tax placed on a producer. From what I remember, an excise tax is a type of indirect tax on goods or services, and it affects both producers and consumers. The burden depends on the elasticity of demand and supply.

Elasticity, right. If demand is elastic, consumers are responsive to price changes. So if a tax is imposed, businesses can't just pass it all on because people might buy less. But if demand is inelastic, consumers don't respond as much, so businesses can pass more of the tax onto them.

Wait, the same goes for supply. If supply is elastic, producers can adjust the quantity easily, so the tax might not get passed as much to consumers. But if supply is inelastic, producers can't change output much, so they might have to soak up more of the tax themselves, meaning less passed to consumers.

So the question is when would consumers bear the largest burden. That would be when they can't avoid the tax by reducing their purchases much (inelastic demand), and the producers can't reduce their supply much either (inelastic supply). But wait, is that correct?

Wait, think again. If both demand and supply are inelastic, then the tax burden is split. But the largest burden on consumers would occur when they have to pay a higher price because demand is inelastic, meaning they can't reduce buying much, so the tax is shifted to them. But also, if the supply is elastic, producers can adjust, but wait, no, if supply is elastic, maybe they can produce less, but if demand isn't elastic, consumers take more of the tax.

Wait, maybe I got this mixed up. Let me structure this.

The general rule I remember is that the tax burden falls more on the side which is less elastic. So if demand is inelastic and supply is elastic, the tax falls more on consumers because they can't change their demand much. Conversely, if supply is inelastic and demand is elastic, the tax falls more on producers.

Wait, so when demand is inelastic, consumers pay more. When supply is elastic, producers can adjust, meaning they can pass more of the tax to consumers because they can change production. Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, think about the extremes. If demand is perfectly inelastic, consumers will pay whatever the price is. So all the tax is passed on. If supply is perfectly elastic, producers can supply any quantity at the same price, so they can't pass the tax onto consumers. Wait, no, if supply is perfectly elastic, the supply curve is horizontal. So a tax would cause the supply curve to shift upward by the tax amount. But if demand is perfectly inelastic, then the price would rise by the full tax amount, so consumers pay it all.

Wait, but in reality, for an excise tax, which is a per-unit tax on production, it's placed on the producer, but the burden is shared. The more inelastic the demand, the more the burden is on consumers. The more inelastic the supply, the more the burden is on producers.

So for maximum burden on consumers, we want demand to be inelastic and supply to be elastic. Because inelastic demand means consumers can't reduce their quantity much, so they pay more. Elastic supply means that producers can adjust their quantity without much change in price (or something like that), so they can pass more of the tax onto consumers.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think about the tax incidence. Suppose the tax is placed on producers. Producers' costs go up, so the supply curve shifts upward by the tax amount. The new equilibrium will determine how much the price increases and how much producers bear.

If demand is inelastic, a given shift in supply will result in a larger price increase because consumers don't cut back much. So the price rises by almost the full amount of the tax. So consumers pay a larger share.

If supply is elastic, then when the tax is imposed, the quantity supplied doesn't decrease much. So the price doesn't have to rise as much to reduce quantity demanded. Wait, no, the supply curve is elastic, so a small change in price leads to a large change in quantity supplied. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Let me try a different approach. The formula for tax burden: the percentage of tax borne by consumers is (elasticity of supply / (elasticity of supply + elasticity of demand)) * 100%.

Wait, no, I think the formula is that the burden on consumers is (supply elasticity / (supply elasticity + demand elasticity)) times the tax. Or was it the other way around?

Wait, I think the correct formula is that the proportion of the tax paid by consumers is (1 / (1 + (Ed / Es))), where Ed is the elasticity of demand and Es is elasticity of supply. Or maybe it's (Es / (Ed + Es)).

Wait, perhaps I should remember that if demand is inelastic (Ed < 1) and supply is elastic (Es > 1), then the denominator is larger, so the fraction is smaller. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, I remember that when demand is inelastic and supply is elastic, the tax burden falls mostly on consumers. Because inelastic demand means consumers can't reduce their buying much, so they end up paying more. Elastic supply means that producers can't reduce their output much, so they pass the tax on.

Wait, no, if supply is elastic, producers can change quantity a lot, so they might not have to bear as much. So the tax is passed more to consumers.

Wait, let's take an example. If the demand is perfectly inelastic (Ed=0), then consumers pay the entire tax. If supply is perfectly elastic, then the supply curve is horizontal, so the entire tax is passed on; the price rises by the full tax amount. So in that case, consumers bear everything.

But if the supply is perfectly inelastic (Es=0), then the supply curve is vertical. So when the tax is imposed, the supply curve shifts up by the tax, but since it's vertical, the quantity doesn't change. So the price increases by the tax amount. Consumers again pay the entire tax.

Wait, so when either demand is perfectly inelastic or supply is perfectly inelastic, the consumers pay the entire tax.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the options given.

The options are combinations of elasticities.

The question is which option causes consumers to pay the largest burden. So looking for the case where consumers pay the maximum possible.

Looking at the options:

Option E: demand elastic, supply inelastic.

Option C: demand inelastic, supply elastic.

Option F: demand perfectly inelastic, supply elastic.

Option J: demand inelastic, supply perfectly inelastic.

Wait, if demand is perfectly inelastic (Option F and G), then consumers pay the entire tax. Because no matter the supply, if demand is perfectly inelastic, any tax is fully passed on.

Similarly, if supply is perfectly inelastic (Options G and J), then the tax cannot affect quantity, so the tax is fully passed on. So in either case, if either curve is perfectly inelastic, consumers bear the entire tax.

Wait, but what if both are perfectly inelastic? For example, option G: demand perfectly inelastic, supply perfectly elastic. Wait, in that case, the demand is a vertical line, and supply is a horizontal line. So when you impose a tax, the supply shifts up. The price would increase by the tax amount because demand is fixed. So consumers pay the full tax.

But wait, if supply is perfectly elastic, that means producers can supply any quantity at a given price. So if the tax is imposed, the supply curve shifts up by the tax amount. But since demand is perfectly inelastic, the quantity doesn't change, so the price has to rise by the full tax. So yes, consumers pay all.

But let's go through each option.

Option A: Both inelastic. So demand and supply are inelastic. Then, the tax burden would be shared. But how much? I think in this case, the burden is more on consumers than producers because both are inelastic, but I'm not sure.

Option B: Demand elastic, supply inelastic. So if demand is elastic, consumers can reduce quantity a lot. Supply inelastic, producers can't adjust much. So the tax would fall more on producers because they can't reduce output, so they have to bear more.

Option C: Demand inelastic, supply elastic. So consumers can't reduce much, and supply can adjust. So producers can pass the tax on to consumers. So consumers pay more.

Option D: Both elastic. So the burden is shared more, but I think the burden is more on producers because both can adjust.

Option E: Demand elastic, supply inelastic. So consumers can reduce, producers can't. So tax falls more on producers.

Option F: Demand perfectly inelastic, supply elastic. So consumers pay the full tax because demand is fixed. Regardless of supply, the price has to adjust so the full tax is passed on.

Option G: Demand perfectly inelastic, supply perfectly elastic. Same as F? If both are extremes, but wait, if supply is perfectly elastic, it's a horizontal line. So the tax shifts it up, but demand is vertical, so the price goes up by the full tax. So consumers pay it all.

Option H: Demand perfectly elastic, supply inelastic. If demand is perfectly elastic, which is a horizontal line. So when tax is imposed, the supply shifts up, but demand is horizontal, so the price can't rise. So producers bear all the tax.

Option I: Demand elastic, supply perfectly elastic. Both can adjust, so the tax incidence would probably be minimal on consumers.

Option J: Demand inelastic, supply perfectly inelastic. Both are inelastic. So the tax can't affect quantity much. So the price rises by the full amount, so consumers pay all.

Wait, so options F, G, and J all result in consumers paying the full tax. But the question is which option results in the largest burden. So perhaps the maximum is when both demand is perfectly inelastic and supply is perfectly inelastic.

Wait, but in reality, if both are perfectly inelastic, the tax is a vertical shift, but quantity doesn't change. So the price would increase by the full tax. So yes, consumers pay all.

Looking at the options again, which of these is an option.

The options are:

Option C: demand inelastic, supply elastic.

Option F: demand perfectly inelastic, supply elastic.

Option J: demand inelastic, supply perfectly inelastic.

So in J, both are inelastic, but one is perfectly and the other is just inelastic. Wait, no, option J says demand is price inelastic and supply is perfectly inelastic.

Wait, so in J, demand is inelastic, supply is perfectly inelastic.

In such a case, both are inelastic. So when the tax is imposed, supply shifts up, but since both are inelastic, the price would increase by the tax amount. So consumers pay all.

But option F is demand perfectly inelastic, supply elastic. So consumers pay all as well.

So which option is correct? The question is which example would result in the largest burden.

Wait, perhaps the largest burden is when both are inelastic. Because if one is elastic, maybe some of the tax is absorbed by producers.

Wait, perhaps the maximum burden on consumers occurs when demand is inelastic and supply is inelastic. Because in that case, the tax can't be shifted much, but wait, no.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about it again. The tax incidence depends on the relative elasticities.

The formula I remember is that the percentage of tax paid by consumers is (Es / (Es - Ed)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach is:

The burden on consumers is determined by the elasticity of demand and supply.

If demand is inelastic (Ed <1), and supply is elastic (Es >1), then consumers bear a larger portion of the tax.

If demand is elastic (Ed >1) and supply is inelastic (Es <1), then consumers bear a smaller portion.

But the extremes are when demand is perfectly inelastic (Ed=0) or supply is perfectly elastic (Es=infinite). In those cases, consumers pay the entire tax.

So looking at the options, which one represents a situation where consumers pay the entire tax.

Option F: demand perfectly inelastic (Ed=0), supply elastic (Es>1). So consumers pay all.

Option J: demand inelastic (Ed<1), supply perfectly inelastic (Es=0). So in this case, how is the tax split?

When Es=0 (perfectly inelastic), then the supply curve is vertical. So when the tax is imposed, the supply curve shifts upward by the tax amount. Since supply is perfectly inelastic, quantity doesn't change. So the price increases by the full tax, so consumers pay all.

So both options F and J result in consumers paying the entire tax. But the question is which option is correct.

Wait, looking at the options, option E is demand elastic and supply inelastic. Option C is demand inelastic and supply elastic.

So if the correct answer is when demand is inelastic and supply is elastic (option C), then consumers bear more.

Wait, but earlier, in the extreme cases where either demand is perfectly inelastic or supply is perfectly elastic, consumers pay all. So perhaps those are more extreme than just inelastic and elastic.

So the question asks which option results in the largest burden. So when either demand is perfectly inelastic or supply is perfectly elastic, consumers pay all.

Looking back at the options, option J is demand inelastic and supply perfectly inelastic. So in that case, since both are inelastic, but especially supply is perfectly inelastic, consumers pay all.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If supply is perfectly inelastic, then the quantity supplied doesn't change. So when the tax is placed on producers, the supply curve shifts up by the tax, but the quantity remains the same. Thus, the price increases by the tax amount, making consumers pay the entire tax.

Similarly, if demand is perfectly inelastic, regardless of supply elasticity, consumers pay the entire tax.

So in options F and J, consumers pay the entire tax.

But the question is which option is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is when demand is inelastic and supply is elastic, but that's option C.

Wait, no, because in that case, consumers don't necessarily pay the entire tax.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me recall a standard result.

The standard result is that the larger the elasticity of demand relative to supply, the more the tax is borne by producers. Conversely, the more inelastic the demand compared to supply, the more consumers bear the tax.

So if demand is inelastic and supply is elastic, the tax burden falls more on consumers.

But in the extreme case where demand is perfectly inelastic, consumers bear the entire tax, regardless of supply.

Similarly, if supply is perfectly elastic, consumers bear the entire tax, regardless of demand.

So in the options given, the maximum burden occurs when either demand is perfectly inelastic or supply is perfectly elastic.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option F: demand perfectly inelastic, supply elastic.

In this case, consumers bear the entire tax.

Option J: demand inelastic, supply perfectly inelastic.

In this case, consumers also bear the entire tax.

So both options F and J result in consumers bearing the entire tax. Therefore, the maximum burden.

But which one is correct as per the options given?

Wait, in the options, option E is demand elastic and supply inelastic. That would mean the burden is more on producers.

The question asks which option results in the largest burden on consumers. So the correct options would be those where either demand is perfectly inelastic or supply is perfectly elastic.

So looking at the options, the correct answer is either option F or J.

Wait, but perhaps the question is looking for when both demand is inelastic and supply is inelastic. Because in that case, the tax can't be shifted much, but in reality, when both are inelastic, the tax is shifted more to consumers.

Wait, no. Let me think. If both demand and supply are inelastic, the tax incidence is split, but the burden on consumers is higher than when, say, demand is elastic.

Alternatively, perhaps the largest burden is when demand is inelastic and supply is elastic, because producers can pass on more of the tax, leading to a higher price for consumers.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option E: demand elastic and supply inelastic, but no, that's the opposite. When demand is elastic, consumers can avoid the tax by buying less, so they pay less.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to approach it with an example.

Suppose the tax is $1 per unit.

Case 1: Demand is perfectly inelastic (Ed=0). No matter the supply, consumers pay the full $1 tax.

Case 2: Demand is inelastic (Ed <1) and supply is elastic (Es>1).

The tax causes supply to shift up. Because demand is inelastic, the price increases more, so consumers pay a larger portion. But not the full $1, perhaps, unless Ed=0.

Wait, perhaps the maximum burden is when Ed=0, regardless of supply.

So looking for the option where demand is perfectly inelastic.

Looking at the options, option F is demand perfectly inelastic and supply elastic. So consumers pay the entire tax.

Option J is demand inelastic and supply perfectly inelastic. So consumers also pay the entire tax.

So both would result in consumers paying the entire tax. But the question is which option is the correct choice.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option where the sum of elasticities is such that the burden is 100% on consumers.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer to be when demand is inelastic and supply is elastic, which is option C.

Wait, but in that case, the burden is more on consumers than producers, but perhaps not the entire tax.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of it another way.

The formula for the tax burden on consumers is:

Tax burden on consumers = (Supply Elasticity) / (Supply Elasticity + Demand Elasticity)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula I remember is:

The share of tax paid by consumers = (1) / (1 + (Ed/Es))

Where Ed is elasticity of demand, Es elasticity of supply.

If Ed is 0 (perfectly inelastic demand), then the formula becomes 1/(1+0) = 1, so consumers pay 100% of the tax.

If Es is 0 (perfectly inelastic supply), then formula denominator is 1 + (Ed/0), which is undefined, but perhaps approaches infinity. So the share approaches zero, which can't be right. Hmm, maybe my formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, I think the correct approach is that the tax burden on consumers is (Es / (Es + Ed)).

Wait, that can't be right because if Ed is higher than Es, then consumers pay less.

Wait, perhaps it's (Ed / (
