Question:

A car manufacturer produced a car that was sold nationwide. Problems with the car's brakes allegedly caused several accidents and injuries. Two individual buyers of the car each filed a class action, in different states, against the manufacturer, asserting the same products liability claims on behalf of all buyers nationwide. One class action was filed in federal court and the other was filed in state court. The parties in the federal action reached a court- approved settlement, and the court entered judgment dismissing the action with prejudice. The manufacturer's attorney has moved to dismiss the state court action on the basis of res judicata (claim preclusion). Should the state court look to federal or state law to decide the effect of the judgment?

Options:

A: Federal law, because the judgment was the result of a nationwide action governed by the federal class action rule.
B: Federal law, due to the nationwide scope of the car manufacturer's operations.
C: State law, because there is no general federal common law and preclusion is a common law doctrine.
D: State law, because the claim involves product liability, a matter of state law.
E: Federal law, because the judgment was entered in federal court.
F: Federal law, because the manufacturer's attorney filed the motion.
G: Federal law, because the claim involves a product that was sold nationwide.
H: State law, because the accidents and injuries happened in multiple states.
I: State law, because the second class action was filed in state court.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about res judicata and which law a state court should use to decide the effect of a federal judgment. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, the question: A car manufacturer had a problem with brakes, leading to accidents. Two class actions were filed, one in federal court and one in state court, both asserting the same product liability claims on behalf of all buyers nationwide. The federal case settled and was dismissed with prejudice. Now, the manufacturer is trying to dismiss the state case using res judicata. The issue is whether the state court uses federal or state law to decide the preclusion effect.

I remember that res judicata, or claim preclusion, generally prevents the same parties from litigating a second lawsuit on the same claim after a court has reached a final judgment. But the tricky part here is whether the state court looks to its own law or federal law to determine this.

So, in this scenario, the first judgment was from federal court, and the second action is in state court. I think the principle here relates to the "full faith and credit" doctrine. Under the US Constitution, state courts must give full faith and credit to federal court judgments. But wait, does that mean they apply federal law to determine the preclusive effect, or do they use their own state's preclusion rules?

I recall that the Supreme Court case of Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons might be relevant, but I'm not sure. Another thought: the concept of which law governs the preclusion effect when a federal court judgment is involved. I think that when a federal court enters a judgment, the preclusive effect is determined by federal law, but when a state court is considering a federal judgment, does it apply its own state's preclusion rules or federal law?

Wait, no, that's not right. The full faith and credit clause requires that state courts recognize the judgments of federal courts, but the preclusive effect is determined by the law of the rendering court. So, if the judgment was from federal court, then federal law determines what is precluded, and the state court must give it that effect. 

Another angle: Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins. Erie says that federal courts must apply state substantive law when sitting in diversity jurisdiction. But here, the question is about the effect of a federal judgment in a state court. So the state court isn't necessarily in a diversity situation; it's a state court applying its own rules, but considering a federal court's judgment.

Wait, but when a federal court enters a judgment, the res judicata effect is determined by federal law, not state law. So when another court (state or federal) is considering whether the judgment has preclusive effect, they look to the law of the court that issued the judgment. So since the first case was in federal court, the preclusion is determined under federal law.

In this case, the state court would need to apply federal law to determine if res judicata applies because the judgment came from a federal court. So the manufacturer's motion would rely on federal res judicata principles.

Looking at the options:

Option E says federal law because the judgment was entered in federal court. That makes sense. Because the judgment is from federal court, the preclusion is determined by federal law.

Other options: Option C says state law because no general federal common law. But res judicata is a procedural issue, and in federal courts, they have their own rules about preclusion. Also, the Supreme Court has held that when a federal court judgment is at issue, the preclusive effect is determined by federal law, regardless of where the second suit is filed.

So the correct answer should be E. Wait, but let me think again. Wait, another point: In some cases, state courts might apply their own preclusion rules if the judgment is from another state's court, but when the judgment is from a federal court, the state court must apply federal preclusion law. Or is it that the state court can choose to apply more generous preclusion rules, but not less?

I think the rule is that when a federal court judgment is involved, the preclusive effect is determined by federal common law, because the judgment is from a federal court, and under the Supremacy Clause, federal law governs the effect of that judgment.

So, the state court should look to federal law to decide the effect of the federal court's judgment. Therefore, the answer is E.

The question involves determining whether a state court should apply federal or state law when deciding the res judicata effect of a federal court judgment dismissing a class action with prejudice. The key issue is the preclusive effect of the federal judgment in the state court proceeding.

Under the U.S. Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause, state courts must recognize and give effect to federal court judgments. However, the preclusive effect of a federal judgment is determined by federal law, not state law. This is because the law of the court that rendered the judgment governs its preclusive effect. Since the judgment in question was entered by a federal court, federal law dictates whether res judicata applies in the state court action.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option E** is correct because the judgment was entered in federal court, and federal law governs the preclusive effect of that judgment.
- Other options, such as **Option C**, are incorrect because the preclusive effect of a federal judgment is not determined by state law, even though there is no general federal common law. Federal courts have their own rules and precedents regarding res judicata.

Thus, the state court should look to federal law to decide the effect of the judgment.
