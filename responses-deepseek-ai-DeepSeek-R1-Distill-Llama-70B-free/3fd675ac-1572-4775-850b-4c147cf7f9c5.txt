Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the value of y in the equation y divided by 4 equals 8. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when you have a variable divided by a number and it's equal to something, you can solve for the variable by doing the opposite operation. So since y is divided by 4, I should multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to get y by itself.

Wait, let me write that down to visualize it better. The equation is y/4 = 8. To isolate y, I multiply both sides by 4. So that would look like (y/4) * 4 equals 8 * 4. On the left side, the 4 in the denominator and the 4 I'm multiplying by should cancel each other out, leaving just y. And on the right side, 8 times 4 is 32. So y must be 32.

Let me double-check that because sometimes I mix up the steps. If I plug y = 32 back into the original equation, does it hold true? Let's see: 32 divided by 4 is 8, which matches the right side of the equation. Yep, that makes sense. So I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is 32.

The equation is y/4 = 8. To solve for y, multiply both sides by 4:

y = 8 * 4  
y = 32  

Verifying by substitution: 32/4 = 8, which is correct.
