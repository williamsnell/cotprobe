Okay, so I have this statistics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that the number of days to build a new house has a variance of 386. A sample of 40 new homes shows an average building time of 83 days. We need to determine with what confidence we can assert that the average building time is between 80 and 90 days. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, I think this is about confidence intervals. Right, when we have a sample mean and we want to estimate the population mean with a certain confidence level, we construct a confidence interval. So the steps probably involve calculating the confidence interval and then seeing which option's confidence level corresponds to the interval 80 to 90 days.

Wait, but the question is phrased a bit differently. It's asking with what confidence we can say the average is between 80 and 90. So maybe it's more about finding the confidence level that corresponds to the interval 80-90, given the sample data.

Let me outline the steps I should take:

1. **Identify the given values:**
   - Sample size (n) = 40
   - Sample mean (x̄) = 83 days
   - Population variance (σ²) = 386 → so σ = sqrt(386)
   - The confidence interval is 80 to 90 days.

2. **Calculate the standard error (SE):**
   SE is σ divided by sqrt(n). So SE = sqrt(386)/sqrt(40).

3. **Find the margin of error (ME):**
   ME is the z-score multiplied by SE. But wait, since the population variance is known, we use the z-distribution, right? Or do we use t-distribution? Hmm, for large sample sizes (n ≥30), z is often used, but technically, when population variance is known, z is appropriate. So I'll go with z.

4. **Determine the z-scores for the given interval:**
   The confidence interval is 80 to 90, so the lower bound is 80 = x̄ - z*(SE), and the upper bound is 90 = x̄ + z*(SE). Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, the sample mean is 83, so 80 is 3 less than 83, and 90 is 7 more. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The confidence interval is from 80 to 90. So the distance from the mean (83) is 3 on the lower side and 7 on the upper. But that doesn't make sense because the interval should be symmetric around the mean if we're using a symmetric distribution like the normal. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the confidence interval is given as 80 to 90, but the sample mean is 83. So the interval is 83 ± some margin. But 80 is 3 below 83, and 90 is 7 above. But that's not symmetric. Wait, that can't be right because confidence intervals are symmetric around the sample mean. So perhaps there's a mistake in my initial approach. Or maybe the question isn't about the confidence interval but about the confidence level that the true mean lies within 80-90 days. Oh wait, no, the question says with what confidence can we assert the average is between 80 and 90 days. So perhaps the confidence interval is given as 80 to 90, and we have to find the confidence level.

Wait, no. Another approach: when you construct a confidence interval, you choose a confidence level (like 95%), calculate the interval, and that interval is the range within which you expect the true mean to lie with that confidence. But here, the interval is given (80-90), and we need to find the confidence level. So maybe we're to find the probability that the true mean lies within this specific interval.

So perhaps the approach is to compute the z-scores for 80 and 90, find the area between those z-scores, and that gives the confidence level.

Wait, let me structure this correctly.

The formula for the confidence interval is:

x̄ ± z * (σ/√n)

But here, we have the interval as 80 to 90, so we can find the z value that corresponds to this interval.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the z-score is (x̄ - μ)/(σ/√n), but since μ is unknown, but we're dealing with the sampling distribution of x̄. But in this case, we're setting up an interval around x̄ and finding the probability that μ lies within that interval.

Wait, another approach: The interval given is 80 to 90. So the width of the interval is 10 days. The standard error (SE) is sqrt(386)/sqrt(40). Let me calculate that.

SE = sqrt(386) ≈ 19.647. Then 19.647 / sqrt(40) ≈ 19.647 / 6.3246 ≈ 3.11 days.

So the margin of error (ME) would be z * SE. But in this case, the total width of the interval is 10 days, which is 2*ME (since ME is on both sides). So 2*ME = 10 → ME =5. Therefore, z = ME / SE = 5 / 3.11 ≈ 1.608.

Now, we need to find the confidence level corresponding to a z-score of approximately 1.608.

Looking at the standard normal distribution table, a z of 1.608 corresponds to the area to the left of z. Let me recall: z=1.6 is about 0.9452, and z=1.61 is 0.9466, z=1.62 is 0.9480. Wait, but wait, my value is 1.608, which is between 1.60 and 1.61. Let me interpolate.

At z=1.60, area is 0.9452.
At z=1.61, area is 0.9466.
The difference is 0.0014 per 0.01 z.
So for 0.008 beyond 1.60 (since 1.608 is 0.008 above 1.60), the area would increase by 0.008 * (0.0014 / 0.01) )= 0.00112. So 0.9452 + 0.00112 = 0.9463. So the cumulative probability up to z=1.608 is approximately 0.9463. But wait, that's the area to the left. The total area within the interval is from -z to +z, which is 2*(0.9463 - 0.5) = 0.8926, or 89.26%.

Looking at the options, option C is 68.9%, which is about 68.27%, which is for z=1. D is 97.2%, which is about 97.72% for z=2. Option E is 82.1%, which doesn't correspond to any standard z value. Option B is 90.5%, which is close to 90%, which is around z=1.645 (90% CI). Wait, but wait, our calculated confidence level is approximately 89.26%, which is close to 89.3%. Looking at the options, none exactly match this, but let's check the options again.

Options are:

A:75.3% → around 0.75 → z≈0.67

B:90.5% → z≈1.645 (90% is 1.645, 95% is 1.96)

C:68.9% → z=1.0 (68% is 1 z)

D:97.2% → z≈2.33 (since 97% is roughly 2.33 z)

E:82.1% → not a standard value.

Hmm, my calculated z is about 1.608, which gives a confidence level of 89.26%. That's not exactly any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, let me double-check my steps.

Wait, the confidence interval is given as 80 to 90. The sample mean is 83, which is the midpoint. So the distance from 83 to 80 is 3, and from 83 to 90 is 7. Wait, that's asymmetric. But confidence intervals are symmetric around the mean, so I think I must have misapplied the formula. Because the way the question is phrased, the interval is 80 to 90, which is asymmetric around 83. That can't be right. So perhaps I misunderstood the question.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the confidence interval is 80-90, but that's not centered on the sample mean. That doesn't make sense because the CI is always centered on the sample mean. So perhaps the question is asking, given a sample mean of 83, variance 386, n=40, what is the confidence level that the true mean is between 80 and 90. Alternatively, perhaps the question is to calculate the confidence interval and see if 80 to 90 falls within it, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the confidence interval for a certain confidence level and see if 80-90 falls within it, but the question is phrased as asserting that the average is between 80 and 90, so perhaps it's asking what confidence level corresponds to that interval.

Wait, let's clarify. The confidence interval for the population mean is calculated as x̄ ± z*(σ/√n). The z depends on the desired confidence level. But in this case, we're given the interval (80 to 90) and need to find the confidence level. So we can compute the z value that corresponds to this interval and then find the confidence level from that z.

So the formula is:

Lower bound = x̄ - z*(σ/√n)

Upper bound = x̄ + z*(σ/√n)

But in our case, the lower bound is 80 and upper is 90, while x̄ is 83. So let's compute the margin of error (ME) as (90 -83)=7 and (83-80)=3. Wait, that's inconsistent. That suggests that the lower and upper ME are different, which shouldn't happen in a symmetric CI. So perhaps the question's interval isn't a standard CI, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the confidence level such that the CI lies entirely within 80-90. But that would require a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach.

We can calculate the z-score for both 80 and 90 and find the area between them.

The formula for z-score is (X - μ) / (σ/√n), but since μ is unknown, we're using the sample mean as an estimate. Wait, but we're actually treating μ as the parameter we're estimating, and the sample mean is x̄. So perhaps we should compute the probability that μ is between 80 and 90, given x̄=83, σ²=386, n=40.

Wait, but that's not the usual approach. Normally, we compute the CI around x̄. But the question is phrased as what confidence can we assert that μ is between 80 and 90, which is a bit different. I think the correct approach is to calculate the probability that μ is in that interval, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: the confidence interval is a range of values around x̄ where μ is likely to be. So the width of the CI depends on the confidence level. If we set the CI to be 80-90, what confidence level does that correspond to?

So, let me compute the z-scores for 80 and 90.

Wait, but for that, I need to compute how many standard errors 80 and 90 are away from the mean.

Wait, the formula would be:

z_lower = (80 - x̄) / (σ/√n)

z_upper = (90 - x̄) / (σ/√n)

So, let's compute these.

First, compute σ/√n.

σ = sqrt(386) ≈ 19.647.

√40 ≈ 6.3246.

So σ/√n ≈ 19.647 / 6.3246 ≈ 3.11.

Now, z_lower = (80 -83)/3.11 ≈ (-3)/3.11 ≈ -0.964.

z_upper = (90 -83)/3.11 ≈7/3.11≈2.25.

Now, the area between z=-0.964 and z=2.25 is the confidence level.

To find this, we can compute P(-0.964 < Z < 2.25), which is the same as Φ(2.25) - Φ(-0.964), where Φ is the standard normal CDF.

Looking up these values:

Φ(2.25) is approximately 0.9772 (since z=2.25 is about 0.9772).

Φ(-0.964) is 1 - Φ(0.964). Φ(0.96) is 0.8233, Φ(0.97)=0.8315. Let's interpolate. 0.964 is 0.96 + 0.004. So 0.004 of the way from 0.96 to 0.97.

The difference between Φ(0.96)=0.8233 and Φ(0.97)=0.8315 is 0.0082 over 0.01 z. So per 0.001 z, the increase is 0.0082 / 10 = 0.00082.

So for 0.004 z beyond 0.96, Φ increases by 0.004 * 0.82 ≈ 0.00328.

So Φ(0.964) ≈ 0.8233 + 0.00328 ≈ 0.8266.

Therefore, Φ(-0.964) = 1 - 0.8266 = 0.1734.

So the area between z=-0.964 and z=2.25 is 0.9772 - 0.1734 = 0.8038, or 80.38%.

Looking at the options, option I is 78.4%, which is close but a bit lower. Option E is 82.1%, which is higher. Hmm, not exact. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the z values.

z_lower = (80-83)/(sqrt(386)/sqrt(40)) = (-3)/(19.647/6.3246) ≈ -3/3.11 ≈ -0.964.

Yes.

z_upper = (90-83)/3.11 ≈7/3.11≈2.25.

Yes.

Now, looking up Φ(2.25): Using a more precise table or calculator, Φ(2.25) is approximately 0.97725.

Φ(-0.964): Let me compute more accurately. Let's use a calculator for Φ(-0.964).

Alternatively, using a standard normal table, for z=0.96, it's 0.8233; z=0.97 is 0.8315. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The z for Φ(-0.964) is the same as 1 - Φ(0.964). So let me correctly compute Φ(0.964).

But perhaps I should use a calculator approach. Alternatively, use linear approximation.

The exact value for Φ(0.964) can be more accurately found. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator or precise table.

Alternatively, I can recall that z=1.0 is 0.8413, z=0.96 is about 0.8233, and z=1.0 is 0.8413.

Wait, no, wait: the standard normal table shows that Φ(z) for positive z is the probability that Z ≤ z. So for z=0.96, Φ=0.8233; z=1.00, Φ=0.8413; z=1.04, Φ=0.8508; z=1.05, 0.8531; z=1.10, 0.8643; z=1.20, 0.8849; z=1.25, 0.8944; z=1.30, 0.9032; z=1.40, 0.9192; z=1.50, 0.9332; z=1.60, 0.9452; z=1.70, 0.9554; z=1.75, 0.9599; z=1.80, 0.9641; z=1.90, 0.9719; z=2.00, 0.9772; z=2.10, 0.9808; z=2.20, 0.9846; z=2.25, 0.9872? Wait, I'm getting conflicting numbers. Let me make sure.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the numbers earlier. Let me check again:

For z=2.00, Φ=0.9772.

z=2.25: I think Φ(2.25)=0.9878? Wait, no, wait. Let me think:

Wait, using an accurate z-table, z=2.00 is 0.9772, z=2.25 is 0.9878, and z=2.50 is 0.9938.

Similarly, for z=1.645, it's 0.9505, and z=1.96 is 0.9750.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in the Φ(2.25) value. So if z=2.25, Φ=0.9878.

Similarly, for z=0.964, let's compute it more accurately.

Let me use a calculator. The exact value of Φ(0.964) can be found using a standard normal distribution calculator. Alternatively, using linear approximation between z=0.96 and z=0.97.

At z=0.96, Φ=0.8233.

At z=0.97, Φ=0.8315.

So the difference is 0.0082 over 0.01 z. So for z=0.964, which is 0.004 above 0.96, the increase is 0.004 * (0.0082 / 0.01) ) = 0.00328. So Φ(0.964)=0.8233 + 0.00328=0.82658.

So Φ(-0.964)=1 - 0
