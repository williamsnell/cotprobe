Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about deriving an expression for the power required to mix a liquid. Hmm, I remember that power in mixing probably relates to some sort of energy being transferred to the liquid. The question says the power depends on density rho, viscosity mu, diameter D of the mixer, rotational speed N, and gravity g. My task is to figure out the correct functional dependence from the given options.

Wait, I think mixing power is often related to the power number in fluid mechanics. The power number, N_p, is a dimensionless quantity used in the context of mixers and agitators. Right, the power required (P) would typically be expressed in terms of other variables. 

So, the general formula I remember is P = N_p * rho * N^3 * D^5. Oh wait, but that's assuming certain conditions, like maybe when the flow is turbulent or laminar. But the problem states that the power depends on rho, mu, D, N, and g. Wait, does that mean all these variables are involved in the power expression?

Alternatively, sometimes the power depends on the Reynolds number, which is Re = (rho * N * D^2) / mu. But in that case, if the expression depends on Re, then maybe the power can be written as a function of Re. But the presence of g complicates things because g usually comes into play with the Froude number, which is Fr = (N^2 * D) / g. 

Wait, but in mixing, especially in processes involving surface aeration or where gravity plays a role (like in bubble columns maybe?), both Re and Fr could be important. Or maybe the problem is considering the influence of gravity on the mixing process, such as in cases where the mixer has to do work against gravity, like blending two immiscible liquids where one is denser.

So, if the power P depends on rho, mu, D, N, and g, then the function would include variables beyond just Re. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: N_p=f(mu, g) — this seems too limited because it's missing rho and N, which are given in the problem statement as dependencies.

Option B: P=f(rho, N, D) — but this misses mu and g, so probably not.

Option C: P=f(mu, N) — again, missing other variables like rho and D, which are said to be dependencies.

Option D: P=f(Re, D) — Re includes rho, N, D, and mu. So Re would be (rho N D²)/mu. Then, P as a function of Re and D. Hmm, but what about g? Since the problem states that g is a variable, this option doesn't include g, so maybe not the right one.

Option E: N_p = f(rho, mu, D, g). Wait, N_p is the power number, which is P/(rho N^3 D^5). So if N_p depends on rho, mu, D, and g, then P would be a function of all these variables. But since N_p is dimensionless, perhaps when you include rho, mu, etc., you're accounting for different regimes, like laminar or turbulent flow, or perhaps surface effects involving gravity.

Option F: P=f(mu, D, g) — misses rho and N, which are dependencies, so probably not.

Option G: N_p = f(D, N) — D and N, but others are missing.

Option H: P=f(rho, mu, g) — again missing D and N.

Option I: P=f(N, g) — missing rho, mu, D.

Option J: N_p = f(Re, Fr). Re is (rho N D²)/mu and Fr is (N² D)/g. Since N_p is a function of both Re and Fr, that would imply that P (which is N_p * rho N^3 D^5) depends on rho, mu, N, D, and g. Because Re brings in rho, mu, N, D, and Fr brings in N, D, g.

Looking back at the problem, the power P is said to depend on rho, mu, D, N, and g. So if N_p is a function of Re and Fr, then P is determined by Re (which includes rho, mu, N, D) and Fr (which includes N, D, g). So all the dependencies are covered.

So option J says N_p = f(Re, Fr). Therefore, the correct answer is J.

Wait, but let me make sure. The power P is expressed as P = N_p * rho * N^3 * D^5. If N_p is a function of Re and Fr, then P is a function of all the variables involved in Re and Fr, which are rho, mu, N, D, and g. That matches the dependencies given in the problem.

Looking at the options, answer J is N_p = f(Re, Fr). So yes, that's correct.

To determine the correct expression for the power required to mix a liquid, we analyze the dependencies provided: density \(\rho\), viscosity \(\mu\), mixer diameter \(D\), rotational speed \(N\), and gravitational acceleration \(g\). The power \(P\) is often expressed in terms of the power number \(N_p\), which is a dimensionless quantity defined as:

\[
N_p = \frac{P}{\rho N^3 D^5}.
\]

The problem specifies that \(P\) depends on \(\rho\), \(\mu\), \(D\), \(N\), and \(g\). This suggests that \(N_p\) must account for these variables. The Reynolds number (\(Re\)) and the Froude number (\(Fr\)) are relevant in this context:

- \(Re = \frac{\rho N D^2}{\mu}\), which incorporates \(\rho\), \(\mu\), \(N\), and \(D\).
- \(Fr = \frac{N^2 D}{g}\), which incorporates \(N\), \(D\), and \(g\).

If \(N_p = f(Re, Fr)\), then \(P = N_p \cdot \rho N^3 D^5\) implicitly depends on all the variables \(\rho\), \(\mu\), \(D\), \(N\), and \(g\), as required by the problem. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \(N_p = f(\mu, g)\) is incorrect because it excludes \(\rho\), \(D\), and \(N\).
- **Option B**: \(P = f(\rho, N, D)\) is incorrect because it excludes \(\mu\) and \(g\).
- **Option C**: \(P = f(\mu, N)\) is incorrect because it excludes \(\rho\), \(D\), and \(g\).
- **Option D**: \(P = f(Re, D)\) is incorrect because it excludes \(g\).
- **Option E**: \(N_p = f(\rho, \mu, D, g)\) is incorrect because it does not account for \(N\).
- **Option F**: \(P = f(\mu, D, g)\) is incorrect because it excludes \(\rho\) and \(N\).
- **Option G**: \(N_p = f(D, N)\) is incorrect because it excludes \(\rho\), \(\mu\), and \(g\).
- **Option H**: \(P = f(\rho, \mu, g)\) is incorrect because it excludes \(D\) and \(N\).
- **Option I**: \(P = f(N, g)\) is incorrect because it excludes \(\rho\), \(\mu\), and \(D\).
- **Option J**: \(N_p = f(Re, Fr)\) is correct because it accounts for all dependencies: \(\rho\), \(\mu\), \(D\), \(N\), and \(g\).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J: \(N_p = f(Re, Fr)\).**
