Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Over the years, a coin collector had amassed a large and valuable collection. On May 1, the collector sent the following letter to a retailer who had long coveted the collector's coin collection:"I've decided to part with my coin collection. Since you've always been interested in purchasing my collection for your store, I'll sell you my entire collection for $50,000. You have until May 15 to make up your mind. "The retailer received this letter on May 3. On May 10, without notif'ing the retailer, the collector sold her coin collection to a novice collector, for $60,000. The next day, the collector sent a letter to the retailer, regretfully informing him that she had sold the coin collection. This letter was received by the retailer on May 13. However, on May 12, the retailer read an article on the internet, published by a reputable site that reports coin collecting news, concerning the collector's sale of her coin collection to the novice collector. After reading the article, the retailer immediately sent an e-mail to the collector accepting her offer to buy the coin collection. This e-mail was read by the collector that same afternoon, May 12. In all likelihood was the retailer's e-mail to the collector on May 12 effective as an acceptance?

Options:

A: No, because the retailer should have responded to the initial letter before the collection was sold to the novice collector.
B: No, because the collector had already sold the collection before the retailer's acceptance, making it invalid.
C: No, because the retailer's acceptance was not valid as the collection had already been sold.
D: Yes, because the retailer's knowledge of the sale to the novice collector was not confirmed until after he sent his acceptance e-mail.
E: Yes, because the retailer's acceptance was made within the specified timeframe.
F: No, because the retailer's reading the article on the internet on May 12 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.
G: Yes, because consideration is not necessary under the UCC for the creation of a sale of goods contract.
H: Yes, because the collector's May 11 letter did not effectuate a revocation, since it was not received by the retailer until May 13.
I: Yes, because the retailer's e-mail was sent before receiving the collector's May 11 letter.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

So, there's a coin collector who wants to sell her collection. She sends a letter to a retailer on May 1 offering to sell the entire collection for $50,000, giving the retailer until May 15 to decide. The retailer receives this letter on May 3. But then, on May 10, the collector sells the collection to someone else—a novice collector—for $60,000. She sends a letter to the retailer on May 11 informing him that she's sold it, which the retailer gets on May 13.

However, on May 12, the retailer reads an article online about the sale to the novice collector. Upon reading this, he immediately sends an email accepting the collector's offer. The collector reads this email on May 12. The question is whether this email acceptance was effective.

Hmm. I remember that in contract law, the timing of offer, acceptance, and revocation is crucial. Let's break it down.

First, the collector made an offer to the retailer. The offer was valid until May 15, so it's an option period. But before that, on May 10, she sold the collection to someone else. Then she sent a letter on May 11 telling the retailer she sold it, but the retailer didn't get that letter until May 13.

So, the key issue here is whether the offer was still open when the retailer tried to accept it on May 12.

I think the general rule is that an offer is revoked when the offeror (the collector) takes an action that's inconsistent with the offer, like selling the goods to someone else. But I'm not sure about the exact rules regarding revocation and when it becomes effective.

Wait, under common law, an offer can be revoked by the offeror any time before acceptance, unless it's a firm offer (like an option contract). Here, the offer was open until May 15, so maybe it's considered a firm offer because the collector gave a specific timeframe. But wait, was there consideration for that? I'm not sure. The question doesn't mention any consideration, so perhaps it's not a firm offer under the common law.

If it's not a firm offer, then the collector can revoke the offer at any time before acceptance. But how does revocation work? I think revocation is effective when the offeree (retailer) receives it. But in this case, the collector sold the collection on May 10, which is an act that revokes the offer. Or, does the revocation occur when the offeree learns about it?

Wait, another angle: the offer was to sell a specific item (the collection). If the collector sells it to someone else, that's a revocation of the offer because she can't perform the contract if she sells it elsewhere. So, when she sold it on May 10, the offer was revoked. But does the revocation take effect when the sale happens, or when the offeree (retailer) finds out?

I remember something about the "dispatch rule" for revocation. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think. For revocation, the offeror's revocation is effective when it's communicated to the offeree, unless it's a firm offer. But if the offeror does something else, like selling the goods, that's a revocation by conduct. I think that under the UCC, which applies here because it's the sale of goods, the offeror's conduct in selling the goods to someone else is a revocation, and that revocation is effective when it's communicated to the offeree or when the offeree otherwise learns about it.

Wait, but the UCC has specific rules. Under UCC 2-206, an offer can be accepted by any medium reasonable under the circumstances, and the offer can be revoked unless it's a firm offer. But without consideration, the offer isn't firm. So the collector could revoke at any time before the retailer accepted.

So when the collector sold the collection on May 10, that's a revocation. But when does the revocation become effective? I think that the revocation is effective when the offeree (retailer) receives notice of it. So in this case, the collector sent a letter on May 11, which the retailer received on May 13. However, before that, on May 12, the retailer read about the sale in an article and then sent an email accepting the offer.

So, the question is whether the offer was still open when the retailer sent the acceptance on May 12.

The collector's act of selling the collection on May 10 revoked the offer. But the revocation (the letter) was sent on May 11 and received on May 13. But the retailer learned about the revocation through the article on May 12. So, when the retailer read the article on May 12, did that constitute knowledge of the revocation, making the offer no longer open?

I think that under the UCC, if the offeree learns of the revocation through a reliable source before attempting to accept, then the acceptance would be ineffective. So, in this case, the retailer knew about the sale from the article before sending the acceptance email.

Wait, but the email was sent immediately after reading the article. So, the timing is crucial. The article was read on May 12, and the email was sent on the same day. But the offer was revoked when the collector sold the collection on May 10, but the revocation was not communicated until May 11, which the retailer didn't know about yet.

Wait, no. The collector's act of selling the collection is a revocation by conduct, which is effective upon the offeree's knowledge. So, when the retailer read the article on May 12, that's when he learned about the revocation. So, at that point, the offer was revoked. So, when he tried to accept, the offer was no longer open. Therefore, the acceptance would be too late.

But wait, let me think again. The offer was to sell the collection. Once the collector sells it, the offer is revoked. The revocation is effective when the offeree (retailer) learns about it. So, when the retailer read the article on May 12, he knew the offer was revoked. Therefore, his acceptance was after revocation, so it's ineffective.

But wait, the answer options might suggest something else. Let me look at the options again.

Option B says no because the collector had already sold the collection before acceptance, making it invalid. That seems to align with this reasoning.

Option F says no because the retailer's reading of the article terminated his power of acceptance. That also sounds relevant because knowing about the sale through the article would mean the offer was revoked.

Option H says the collector's May 11 letter didn't revoke because it wasn't received until May 13. So, maybe the revocation is effective upon receipt. But I thought revocation by conduct (selling the goods) is effective upon the offeree's knowledge, not upon the offeror's sending a letter.

Wait, but the collector sent a letter on May 11 to revoke, which was received on May 13. But the retailer learned about the sale on May 12 through the article. So, does the revocation occur when the offeror sells the goods, or when the offeree learns about it?

I think that under UCC §2-206(1), an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance or before it has been otherwise terminated. Revocation can occur by taking an action inconsistent with the offer, like selling the goods. But the revocation is effective when the offeree learns about it. So, when the retailer learned about the sale on May 12, the offer was revoked at that point.

So, the acceptance by email was on May 12, but if the revocation occurred when the retailer learned about it (same day), then the acceptance would be too late.

Wait, but the email was sent on May 12, same day as reading the article. Let me think about the timeline:

- May 10: Collector sells to novice.

- May 11: Collector sends revocation letter to retailer.

- May 12: Retailer reads article about sale, then sends acceptance email.

So, when the retailer read the article on May 12, that's when he learned of the revocation. At that point, the offer was revoked. So, his acceptance was after revocation.

But wait, the email was sent the same day. If the revocation occurs when the offeree learns of it, then the moment the retailer read the article (May 12), the offer was revoked. Therefore, his acceptance email sent on May 12 would be after the revocation, making it ineffective.

So, the acceptance was too late. Therefore, the answer would be that the email was not effective.

Looking at the options, option B says No, because the collector had already sold the collection before the retailer's acceptance, making it invalid. That's correct.

Option F says No because the retailer's reading of the article terminated his power of acceptance. That's also correct. So, which option is better?

Wait, the two options (B and F) are similar but phrased differently. Option B focuses on the sale happening before acceptance, while F focuses on the retailer's knowledge from the article.

The correct reasoning is that the offer was revoked when the retailer learned about the sale, which was via the article on May 12. So, the revocation was effective upon the retailer's knowledge, making the acceptance ineffective.

So, the answer would be option F: No, because the retailer's reading the article on May 12 terminated the power of acceptance.

Wait, but another angle: The offer was open until May 15. The collector tried to revoke it by selling the collection on May 10. But under UCC, an offer can be revoked by the offeror's conduct inconsistent with the offer, and that revocation is effective when it is communicated to the offeree or when the offeree otherwise learns about it.

So, the revocation occurred when the retailer learned about the sale, which was May 12. So, the acceptance on May 12 was after the revocation, making it ineffective. Therefore, the correct answer is either B or F.

But looking at the options again:

Option B: No, because the collector had already sold the collection before the retailer's acceptance, making it invalid.

Option F: No, because the retailer's reading the article on May 12 terminated the retailer's power of acceptance.

Wait, the UCC says that an offer can be revoked by the offeror's conduct that's inconsistent with the offer, and the revocation is effective when the offeree learns of it. So, in this case, the offer was revoked when the retailer learned about the sale via the article, which was on May 12. Therefore, the retailer's acceptance via email on May 12 came after the revocation, making it ineffective.

So, the email was sent on May 12, but after the revocation had taken effect that same day.

Wait, but the timeline is: on May 12, the retailer read the article in the morning, then sent the email in the afternoon. So, the revocation occurs at the time he reads the article, and the acceptance via email happens later that day. So, the acceptance is after the revocation.

Therefore, the answer is F: No, because the retailer's reading the article on May 12 terminated the power of acceptance.

But wait, another point: the offer wasn't revoked until the offeror took an action that made it impossible to perform. So, the collector's sale on May 10 revoked the offer, but the revocation is only effective when the retailer knew or had reason to know about it.

So, when the retailer read the article on May 12, he had knowledge, so the revocation was effective. Therefore, the acceptance sent on May 12 was after revocation.

So, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but some sources say that the revocation is effective when the offeree actually learns about it. So, if the offeree sends an acceptance before learning about the revocation, it's still valid. But in this case, the acceptance was sent after learning about the revocation.

Wait, no. The sequence is: on May 12, the retailer reads the article (learns of revocation), then sends the email. So, the acceptance was after the revocation. Therefore, it's ineffective.

So, the answer is F.

Alternatively, option B says that the collector had already sold the collection before the acceptance, making it invalid. That's also correct, but perhaps F is more precise because it's about the retailer's knowledge terminating the power of acceptance.

But wait, the UCC also says that if the offeror sells the goods, that's a revocation, and it's effective when the offeree learns about it. So, the key here is that the offer was revoked when the retailer learned about the sale, which was on May 12. So, the acceptance sent on May 12 was after revocation.

Therefore, the acceptance was not effective.

Looking through the options, the correct answer should be either B or F.

Another approach: the question is about whether the acceptance was effective. For it to be effective, the offer must still be open. The offer was revoked when the collector sold the collection on May 10, but that revocation only becomes effective upon the retailer's knowledge. So, when the retailer learned about it on May 12, the offer was revoked. Therefore, when he tried to accept on May 12, the offer was no longer open. So, the acceptance is ineffective.

So, the reason is that the retailer's power of acceptance was terminated when he learned about the revocation via the article. So, the correct answer is F.

The question revolves around whether the retailer's email acceptance on May 12 was effective, given the timeline of events. The collector sent an offer to the retailer on May 1, which was open until May 15. However, the collector sold the collection to a novice collector on May 10 and sent a revocation letter to the retailer on May 11, which the retailer received on May 13. On May 12, the retailer read an article about the sale and immediately sent an email accepting the collector's offer. The collector read this email on May 12.

Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), an offer can be revoked by the offeror's actions inconsistent with the offer, such as selling the goods to another party. The revocation is effective when the offeree learns about it. Here, the collector's sale of the collection on May 10 constituted a revocation by conduct. However, this revocation only became effective when the retailer learned about it through the article on May 12. At that point, the offer was no longer open, and the retailer's subsequent email acceptance was therefore ineffective.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The retailer's acceptance was not required to be sent before the collection was sold; the issue is whether the offer was still open when the retailer attempted to accept.
- **Option B**: Correct in substance, as the collector's sale of the collection revoked the offer. However, it does not emphasize the role of the retailer's knowledge in terminating the offer.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The invalidity of the acceptance is due to the revocation, not merely because the collection was sold.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The timing of the retailer's knowledge of the sale is what matters, not the lack of confirmed knowledge.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The acceptance was not within the specified timeframe because the offer had already been revoked.
- **Option F**: Correct. The retailer's reading of the article on May 12 terminated the power of acceptance, as it informed him of the revocation.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Consideration is irrelevant to this scenario.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The revocation was effective when the retailer learned about the sale, not when he received the collector's letter.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The timing of the email relative to the letter is not the determining factor.

The most precise answer is **Option F**, as it directly addresses that the retailer's knowledge of the sale via the article terminated the power of acceptance, making the email acceptance ineffective.

Answer: F
