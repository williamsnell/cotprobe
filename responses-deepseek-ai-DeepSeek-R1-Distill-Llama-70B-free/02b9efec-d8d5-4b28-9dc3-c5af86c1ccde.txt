Okay, so I've got this problem here about steam condensing in a pipe, and I need to find out how much steam condenses per hour per unit length of the pipe. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The pipe is 1 and a half inches in diameter, schedule 40, and it's uninsulated. The surrounding air is at 50°F. The steam inside is saturated at 100 psia. Oh, right, so the steam temperature is higher than the surroundings, so heat will be lost, causing condensation.

Wait, I remember that when heat is lost from the steam, it condenses. So the heat transfer rate will determine how much steam is condensed. The formula I think is Q = U * A * ΔT, but I'm not sure. Or wait, maybe it's Q = h * A * (T_s - T_surrounding).

But wait, the problem gives the convection coefficient on the outside, which is 2.0 Btu/hr·sqft·°R. So the heat transfer from the pipe to the air is via natural convection. Right, so the heat loss per unit length would be the key here.

First, I need to find the temperatures. The steam is at 100 psia. What's the saturation temperature at that pressure? Oh right, at 100 psia, the saturation temperature is higher than 100°F. Wait, let me think—standard steam tables: At 14.7 psia, water boils at 212°F. Wait no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 100 psia is about 100 psi above atmospheric. So atmospheric is 14.7 psi, so 100 psia is 114.7 psia. No wait, wait, no—psia is pounds per square inch absolute. Oh, wait, 100 psia is 100 psi above vacuum. Wait, but 0 psia is a vacuum, so 100 psia is 100 psi. So what's the saturation temperature at 100 psia? I think it's around 327.8°F. Let me double-check that in my mind. Yeah, I remember that at 100 psia, the saturation temp is about 327.8°F. So T_sat is 327.8°F.

The surrounding air is at 50°F. So the temperature difference is 327.8 - 50 = 277.8°F. But wait, when calculating heat transfer, we have to be careful with the units. Oh, but since it's a difference, the units (°F) will cancel out, so that's okay.

Next, I need the surface area. The pipe is 1.5 inches in diameter, and we're considering unit length, so 1 foot. Wait, the diameter is 1.5 inches. So radius is 0.75 inches. But to get the circumference, which is π*d, in feet.

Wait, the pipe is 1.5 inches in diameter. So 1.5 inches is 1.5/12 = 0.125 feet. So the circumference is π * 0.125 ft. That would be the perimeter, which is the length around the pipe. But for heat transfer, we usually use the outside surface area, which is the circumference times the length. Since we're looking for per unit length (per foot), the area per foot is just the circumference.

So the surface area A is π * D, where D is in feet. So D = 1.5 inches = 0.125 ft. So A = π * 0.125 ≈ 0.3927 square feet per foot of pipe.

But wait, is the pipe's outside diameter the same as the inside? No, schedule 40 pipe has walls, so the outside diameter is larger. Wait, but the problem states it's a 1.5-inch schedule 40 pipe. So I think for schedule 40, the outside diameter is the same as the nominal diameter, I think. Wait, no, the nominal diameter for pipe is the outside diameter. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. For example, 1-inch schedule 40 pipe has an outside diameter of 1.315 inches. So for a 1.5-inch pipe, the outside diameter would be larger than 1.5 inches.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think the nominal pipe size (NPS) is the outside diameter in inches for sizes 12 and below. So for NPS 1.5, the outside diameter is 1.5 inches for schedule 40? Or is it different?

Wait, no, I think for smaller pipes, the outside diameter is indeed the nominal size. So for a 1.5 NPS, the outside diameter is 1.5 inches. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the schedule 40 would add wall thickness. Hmm, maybe NPS refers to the inside diameter? No, no, I think for NPS 1.5, the outside diameter is 1.5 inches, and the inside diameter is smaller based on the schedule.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up the exact outside diameter for a 1.5-inch schedule 40 pipe. But since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed with the given diameter as the outside. Or maybe the problem is simplifying it, treating the diameter as 1.5 inches for the outside.

Wait, the question says "1(1/2) in sch. 40 steam pipe", so the nominal size is 1.5 inches. But the actual outside diameter could be a bit larger. Hmm, but maybe for the sake of this problem, they're considering the outside diameter as 1.5 inches. Because if I proceed with that, the circumference is π * 1.5 inches. But wait, wait—wait, no, because the units for the convection coefficient are in feet. So I should convert inches to feet.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, the pipe is 1.5 inches in diameter, so whether it's inside or outside depends on the schedule. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's using the outside diameter as 1.5 inches. Alternatively, maybe it's the inside, and I need to find the outside.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the given diameter is the outside diameter. So D = 1.5 inches. Wait, but then when I convert to feet, that's 0.125 feet. So the circumference is π * 0.125 ≈ 0.3927 feet. So the surface area per foot is 0.3927 square feet.

Wait, but if the pipe is schedule 40, the outside diameter is the same as the nominal size, I think. So yes, D = 1.5 inches. So that part is okay.

Now, the heat transfer rate Q is given by Q = h * A * (T_s - T_air). So h is 2.0 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R). A is 0.3927 ft² (per foot of pipe), and T_s is 327.8°F, T_air is 50°F. So ΔT = 327.8 -50 = 277.8 °F.

Wait, but degrees Fahrenheit and Rankine have the same size units when it comes to differences. So a temperature difference of 1°F is equal to 1°R. So the calculation is okay.

So Q = 2.0 * 0.3927 * 277.8. Let me compute that.

Calculating that: 2 * 0.3927 = 0.7854. 0.7854 * 277.8 ≈ Let's compute 0.7854 * 277.8.

0.7854 * 277.8: Let me do this step by step.

0.7 * 277.8 = 194.46

0.08 * 277.8 = 22.224

0.0054 * 277.8 ≈ 1.500 (since 0.005*277.8=1.389, 0.0004*277.8≈0.111, so total ≈1.5)

Adding these together: 194.46 +22.224=216.684 +1.5≈218.184 Btu/hr per foot of pipe.

Wait, but wait a second. Is this the heat loss per foot? Yes, because A is per foot.

So Q ≈218.184 Btu/hr-ft.

Now, the next part is to find how much steam condenses. The heat lost is used to condense the steam. The latent heat of vaporization at 100 psia is needed.

Wait, the latent heat (h_fg) at 100 psia. Let me recall: At atmospheric pressure (14.7 psia), h_fg is about 970.3 Btu/lbm. But at higher pressures, it's lower.

Wait, at 100 psia, what's h_fg? I think it's around 880 Btu/lbm. Let me confirm mentally. Hmm, yes, I think it's about 888 Btu/lbm. Let me take it as approximately 888 Btu/lbm.

So the heat required to condense steam is Q = m * h_fg. So m = Q / h_fg.

So m = 218.184 Btu/hr-ft / 888 Btu/lbm.

Calculating that: 218.184 / 888 ≈ Let's compute.

888 goes into 218 about 0.245 times. Let me do exact division:

888 = 800 + 88.

218.184 / 888 ≈ 0.2457 lbm/hr-ft.

Wait, 888 * 0.2457 = 888 * 0.2 = 177.6, 888*0.04=35.52, 888*0.0057≈5.06. So 177.6+35.52=213.12 +5.06=218.18. So yes, 0.2457 lbm/hr-ft.

But wait, the options are in lb/hr-ft, and the options are like 0.5, 0.6, etc.

Hmm, 0.2457 is about 0.25 lb/hr-ft, but none of the options are that low. Wait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Ah! Wait a second. Wait, the heat transfer Q is per foot of pipe, but I might have miscalculated the surface area.

Wait, the pipe's circumference is π times the diameter. Wait, diameter in feet, right.

Wait, the pipe is 1.5 inches in diameter, which is 1.5/12 feet = 0.125 ft. So circumference is π * 0.125 ≈ 0.3927 ft, correct. So surface area per foot is 0.3927 sq.ft.

h is 2.0 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R), correct.

ΔT is 327.8 -50 = 277.8 °F.

So Q = 2.0 * 0.3927 * 277.8 = ?

Wait, 2 * 0.3927 is 0.7854.

0.7854 * 277.8 = ?

Let me compute that more accurately.

0.7854 * 277.8:

Break it down:

0.7 * 277.8 = 194.46

0.08 * 277.8 = 22.224

0.0054 * 277.8 = ?

0.005 * 277.8 = 1.389

0.0004 *277.8 = 0.11112

So 1.389 + 0.11112 = 1.50012

So total Q = 194.46 + 22.224 + 1.50012 ≈ 218.184 Btu/hr per foot.

Wait, that's correct. So Q ≈218.184 Btu/hr-ft.

Then, m = Q / h_fg.

h_fg at 100 psia is indeed approximately 888 Btu/lbm.

So m = 218.184 / 888 ≈ 0.2457 lbm/hr-ft.

But none of the options are near 0.25. The options start at 0.4 (option E), and go up to 1.0. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let me check all the steps again.

Wait, h is given as 2.0 Btu/(hr·sqft·°R). Correct. The area is in sqft, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the temperature difference is lower? Because maybe I'm using the wrong saturation temperature.

Wait, wait, 100 psia is 100 psi above atmospheric pressure. Wait, no, psia is absolute pressure. So 100 psia is 100 psi above a vacuum. So atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia. So 100 psia is 85.3 psi above atmospheric.

But in terms of temperature, the saturation temperature at 100 psia is about 327.8°F, as I thought before. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I used the wrong value for h_fg. What if it's higher? Let me think again. At 100 psia, h_fg is indeed around 888 Btu/lbm. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the thermal resistance of the pipe wall? Oh wait, the problem says the pipe is uninsulated, so we consider the outside convection, but maybe the conduction through the pipe wall is significant? Or perhaps the inside convection is involved.

Wait, but the problem says to consider the pipe as a grey body and uninsulated. Wait, perhaps the radiation is involved, but the problem says to consider the heat transfer by natural convection from the outside surface. So maybe radiation is neglected, and only convection is considered.

Wait, but the problem states the coefficient given is for natural convection. So I think the calculation is correct as I did it.

Hmm, but then the result I got is around 0.2457 lb/hr-ft, but the options don't go that low. So perhaps I made a mistake in the surface area.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the diameter. Let me double-check: The pipe is 1.5 inches in diameter, which is 0.125 feet. So circumference is π * 0.125 = ~0.3927 ft, correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the inside diameter for the heat transfer area. Because the steam is inside, but the convection is from the outside. So perhaps the outside diameter is larger, so the circumference is larger, leading to a larger area.

Wait, if the pipe is schedule 40, 1.5 inches, what's the outside diameter? Let me think. Schedule 40 for 1.5" pipe: The outside diameter is 1.5 inches for NPS 1.5. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look up the actual outside diameter for a 1.5" schedule 40 pipe.

Wait, from what I recall, the outside diameter for 1.5" schedule 40 is 1.5 inches. So perhaps the earlier calculation is correct.

Wait, but if I use a larger diameter, say, 1.6 inches, then the circumference would be π * 1.6/12 = π * 0.1333 ≈ 0.4189 ft, which would make the area a bit larger. Let's try that.

If D is 1.6 inches, then 1.6/12 = 0.1333 ft. Circumference is π * 0.1333 ≈ 0.4189 ft² per foot.

Then Q = 2.0 * 0.4189 * 277.8 ≈ 2 * 0.4189 = 0.8378; 0.8378 * 277.8 ≈ 232.8 Btu/hr-ft.

Then m = 232.8 / 888 ≈ 0.262 lb/hr-ft. Still too low.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the latent heat value. Let me check that again.

Wait, maybe I confused h_fg with h_f. Or perhaps I should use the enthalpy of saturated vapor minus the enthalpy of saturated liquid, which is indeed h_fg.

Wait, at 100 psia, let's confirm h_fg. Let me think: At 100 psia, looking up steam tables, h_f is about 298.6 Btu/lbm, h_g is 1187.5 Btu/lbm, so h_fg is 1187.5 - 298.6 = 888.9 Btu/lbm. So yes, 888.9 is correct.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the surface area. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is using the inside diameter for the heat transfer, but that doesn't make sense because the convection is from the outside.

Wait, another possibility: The steam is condensing inside the pipe, so the heat transfer is from the steam to the pipe wall, then from the pipe wall to the surroundings. So perhaps I should consider both the inside convection and the outside convection, as well as conduction through the pipe wall. But the problem states to consider only the outside convection, or perhaps the inside is saturated steam with a high convection coefficient, making the outside the limiting factor.

Wait, but the problem gives the coefficient for the outside surface, so perhaps we can ignore the inside resistance. So the calculation remains as I did before.

But then, the result doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Wait, wait, the pipe is 1.5 inches in diameter, but when calculating the area, I used 0.125 ft for the diameter. Wait, no, the circumference is π * diameter, so if the diameter is 1.5 inches, which is 0.125 ft, so circumference is π * 0.125 ft ≈ 0.3927 ft, which is correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the steam is flowing inside, and the convection inside is significant. So perhaps I should use the inside diameter for calculating the area. But then, the heat transfer from the steam to the pipe would be via convection inside, but the problem only gives the outside convection coefficient. So, perhaps the total thermal resistance is the sum of inside convection, conduction, and outside convection. But the problem doesn't provide the inside convection coefficient, so maybe only the outside is considered.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the inside heat transfer coefficient is very high, so the outside is the limiting factor, hence only considering the outside.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the initial calculation, but then the result doesn't match any options. So maybe I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe I should calculate the heat flux first, then the heat transfer per foot.

Heat flux q" is h*(T_s - T_air) = 2.0
