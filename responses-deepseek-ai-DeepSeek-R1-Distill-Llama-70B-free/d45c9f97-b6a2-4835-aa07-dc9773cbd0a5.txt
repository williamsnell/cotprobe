Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that 3.0 mmol of nitrogen gas (N₂) occupies 36 cm³ at 300 K, and then it expands to 60 cm³. I need to calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for this process. The options are from A to J, with various values in joules.

Hmm, I remember that Gibbs free energy change for a process at constant temperature is given by the equation ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1), but wait, is that when pressure changes? Or maybe it's when the reaction is at constant pressure? Wait, no, I think for expansion at constant temperature, the formula might be ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1) or maybe the inverse, depending on whether it's expansion or compression.

Wait, no, wait a second. I'm a bit confused. Because I also recall that for an ideal gas undergoing a process at constant temperature, the change in Gibbs free energy can be calculated using ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1), but since pressure and volume are inversely related (from PV = nRT), maybe I can express this in terms of volume change as well.

Wait, let's think again. The formula for Gibbs free energy change when the pressure changes is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). But since the process here is expansion at constant temperature, the pressure must be changing. But we don't have the pressures given, so maybe it's easier to express this in terms of volume.

Alternatively, I remember another formula: ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1) when the pressure is constant? Or wait, no, that might be for Helmholtz free energy. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since the gas is expanding, and assuming it's a reversible process at constant temperature, the Gibbs free energy change can be found using ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). But since I don't have P1 and P2, maybe I can find them using the ideal gas law.

Wait, the initial state is 3.0 mmol N₂ at 36 cm³ and 300 K. The final state is the same amount of gas at 60 cm³ and 300 K. So both processes are at 300 K, so temperature is constant.

Let me calculate the initial and final pressures using PV = nRT. Wait, but I can express the pressures in terms of volume since n and T are constant.

So, P1 = (nRT)/V1, and P2 = (nRT)/V2. So P2/P1 = V1/V2.

So then, ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1) = nRT ln(V1/V2).

Wait, but wait, wait. Because for an ideal gas, at constant T, the Gibbs free energy change is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). But since P2 = (nRT)/V2 and P1 = (nRT)/V1, then P2/P1 = V1/V2. So yes, substituting, ΔG = nRT ln(V1/V2).

Wait, but wait another thing. Or is it the other way around? Because when a gas expands, the pressure decreases. So if the system is doing work, like expanding against a lower pressure, then the Gibbs free energy would reflect that.

Wait, let me make sure. The formula I have is correct. So, let's plug in the numbers.

First, n is 3.0 mmol, which is 3.0 × 10^-3 mol.

R is the gas constant, which is 8.314 J/mol·K.

T is 300 K.

V1 is 36 cm³, V2 is 60 cm³.

So, ΔG = nRT ln(V1/V2) because P2/P1 = V1/V2.

Wait, wait, no, because P2 is less than P1 when V increases, so ln(P2/P1) would be negative. Alternatively, since V2 > V1, V1/V2 is less than 1, so ln would be negative, making ΔG negative. Which makes sense because expansion might be spontaneous under certain conditions, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, but wait, the formula might actually be ΔG = nRT ln(P1/P2) for expansion work. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should approach it through the Gibbs free energy equation.

Alternatively, I remember that for an ideal gas, the Gibbs free energy change when expanding from V1 to V2 at constant temperature is given by ΔG = nRT ln(V2/V1) only when pressure is constant. But wait, no, that's not correct because Gibbs free energy depends on pressure, not volume.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of entropy and enthalpy. The Gibbs free energy change is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. But for an ideal gas at constant temperature, the enthalpy change ΔH is zero because the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature, and ΔH = ΔU + PΔV. Wait, no, for expansion at constant T, ΔU is zero, so ΔH = PΔV. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, maybe I should stick to the original approach. Let's get back to calculating using ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1).

Since P1 = nRT/V1 and P2 = nRT/V2, then P2 = P1 * V1/V2.

So, P2/P1 = V1/V2.

So, ΔG = nRT ln(V1/V2).

Wait, but wait, if the gas is expanding, then V2 > V1, so V1/V2 < 1, so ln(V1/V2) is negative. So ΔG would be negative, which implies the process is spontaneous. But wait, the question is asking for the ΔG of the process, whether it's spontaneous or not.

Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure. When the system does work (expansion), the Gibbs free energy change is negative if the process is spontaneous. But I'm not sure about the physical conditions here. Alternatively, perhaps the process is reversible and at constant temperature and pressure, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I might have the formula wrong. Because I'm pretty sure that for the Gibbs free energy change when pressure changes at constant T, it's ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). So in this case, since the volume increases, the pressure decreases, so P2 < P1, making ln(P2/P1) negative, so ΔG would be negative. So that aligns with the earlier conclusion.

So, let's compute the numbers.

n = 3.0 mmol = 3.0e-3 mol.

R = 8.314 J/mol·K.

T = 300 K.

V1 = 36 cm³ = 36e-6 m³. Wait, no, wait, 1 m³ is 1e6 liters, and 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³? Wait, no: 1 m³ = 1e3 liters, because 1 liter is 0.001 m³. So 1 cm³ is 1e-3 liters, which is 1e-6 m³? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 1 m³ = 1000 liters (since 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m³ = 100 cm × 100 cm × 100 cm = 1e6 cm³). So 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³? Wait, no, 1 m³ is 1e6 liters? No, 1 m³ is 1000 liters, as 1 liter is 0.001 m³. So 1 cm³ is 1e-3 liters, which is 1e-6 m³? Wait, no, 1 liter is 1 dm³, which is 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm = 1000 cm³. So 1 cm³ is 0.001 liters, which is 1e-3 dm³, or 1e-6 m³. So yes, correct.

Wait, but in the ideal gas law, the volume is in m³, pressure in Pascals, n in moles, R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So, V1 = 36 cm³ = 36e-6 m³.

V2 = 60 cm³ = 60e-6 m³.

So, P1 = nRT/V1.

But wait, I don't need to calculate P1 and P2, because I can express P2/P1 as V1/V2, as we did before.

So, ΔG = nRT ln(V1/V2).

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Since P2/P1 = V1/V2, then ln(P2/P1) = ln(V1/V2).

So, ΔG = nRT ln(V1/V2).

But wait, if V2 > V1, then V1/V2 is less than 1, so ln is negative.

So, let's plug in the numbers:

n = 3.0e-3 mol.

R = 8.314 J/mol·K.

T = 300 K.

V1 = 36e-6 m³.

V2 = 60e-6 m³.

So,

ΔG = (3.0e-3 mol) * (8.314 J/mol·K) * (300 K) * ln(36e-6 / 60e-6).

Wait, 36e-6 divided by 60e-6 is 36/60 = 0.6.

So ln(0.6) is approximately... let me think. ln(1) is 0, ln(e) is 1, but more precisely, ln(0.6) is about -0.5108.

So,

ΔG = 3e-3 * 8.314 * 300 * (-0.5108).

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 3e-3 * 8.314 = 0.024942.

Then, 0.024942 * 300 = 7.4826.

Then, 7.4826 * (-0.5108) ≈ -3.823 J.

So approximately -3.8 J.

Looking at the options, option B is -3.8 J.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I might make a mistake in the arithmetic.

Let me recalculate:

nRT = 3e-3 * 8.314 * 300.

3e-3 is 0.003.

0.003 * 8.314 = 0.024942.

0.024942 * 300 = 7.4826.

Then, multiply by ln(0.6) which is approximately -0.5108256.

So 7.4826 * (-0.5108256) = ?

Let me compute 7.4826 * 0.5108256 first.

7 * 0.5 is 3.5, but more accurately:

7.4826 * 0.5108256 ≈ 3.823.

So with the negative sign, it's -3.823 J, which rounds to -3.8 J, so option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: the formula I used was ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). But I'm assuming that the process is at constant temperature and that the gas behaves ideally. Also, is the process reversible? Because if it's a free expansion, then the pressure isn't changing against a constant external pressure, but in that case, the formula might not apply. So perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Wait, no, the formula ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1) applies to any isothermal process of an ideal gas, regardless of whether it's reversible or not. Because Gibbs free energy is a state function, so it only depends on the initial and final states, not the path taken.

So, even if the expansion is free (against vacuum), the change in Gibbs free energy would still be the same as if it were done reversibly. So the calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, another approach: using ΔG = VΔP, but that's when pressure is constant, which isn't the case here. So probably the first method is the correct way.

Thus, the correct answer is option B: -3.8 J.
</think>

To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the expansion of 3.0 mmol of N₂ gas from 36 cm³ to 60 cm³ at 300 K, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta G = nRT \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)
\]

For an ideal gas, the ratio of pressures can be expressed in terms of volumes:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{V_1}{V_2}
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
\Delta G = nRT \ln\left(\frac{V_1}{V_2}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Identify the given values
- **Number of moles**: \( n = 3.0 \, \text{mmol} = 3.0 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mol} \)
- **Gas constant**: \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \)
- **Temperature**: \( T = 300 \, \text{K} \)
- **Initial volume**: \( V_1 = 36 \, \text{cm}^3 = 36 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^3 \)
- **Final volume**: \( V_2 = 60 \, \text{cm}^3 = 60 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^3 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the volume ratio
\[
\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \frac{36}{60} = 0.6
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \ln(V_1 / V_2) \)
\[
\ln(0.6) \approx -0.5108
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \Delta G \)
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\Delta G = (3.0 \times 10^{-3}) (8.314) (300) \ln(0.6)
\]

First, calculate \( nRT \):

\[
nRT = (3.0 \times 10^{-3}) (8.314) (300) = 7.4826 \, \text{J}
\]

Now, multiply by \( \ln(0.6) \):

\[
\Delta G = 7.4826 \times (-0.5108) \approx -3.823 \, \text{J}
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated value of \( \Delta G \) is approximately \( -3.8 \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
