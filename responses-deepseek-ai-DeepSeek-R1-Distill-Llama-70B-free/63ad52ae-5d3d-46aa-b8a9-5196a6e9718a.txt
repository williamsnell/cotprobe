Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Boolean logic question. Let me read it again carefully. The question is asking which of the conditions I, II, III can be expressed using a Boolean formula with variables p1 to p4 and the connectives AND (∧) and OR (∨), but without using NOT (¬). The options are combinations of these conditions, and I need to pick the right one.

Let me break down each condition one by one.

Condition I: At least three of p1, p2, p3, p4 are true. So this means three or four of them are true. How can I express that without using negation? Hmm. Well, for at least three, I think I can create a formula that includes all possible combinations where three are true, plus the case where all four are true. 

Each of these combinations can be expressed using conjunctions. For example, (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p4) ∨ ... all possible groups of three. And then also include (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4). But wait, that might be redundant because if all four are true, any three would already cover it. Or maybe not, because each term is a conjunction of exactly three. So, to cover all possibilities, I need to write all possible combinations where exactly three are true, and then OR them together. But wait, the question allows using ∧ and ∨ without ¬, so that's possible. So condition I can be expressed.

Condition II: Exactly three are true. So this is similar to I but without including the case where all four are true. So the formula would be the same as in I but without the four-truth case. Wait no, condition I is at least three, which includes exactly three and exactly four. So condition II is exactly three, which would be the sum of all exactly-three terms. So yes, that can be done with just ∧ and ∨. So condition II is expressible.

Condition III: An even number of p1-p4 are true. So that would be 0, 2, or 4. Wait, can I express this without using negation? Because even numbers include 0 (all false), 2, and 4. Hmm. Let me think. To express that an even number are true.

In Boolean logic, an even number of variables being true can be tricky without negation. Because to express even parity, you usually need some kind of XOR conditions, but since we only have ∧ and ∨, maybe it's possible another way.

Wait, but I remember that without negation, certain things can't be expressed. For example, checking for even parity might require some form of negation because it's about the count being even, which isn't directly expressible with just AND and OR.

Let me think about how to express that exactly two are true. That would be (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ ¬p3 ∧ ¬p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p3 ∧ ¬p2 ∧ ¬p4) and so on for each pair. But without negation, I can't express ¬p3 or ¬p4. So I can't directly write the condition for exactly two being true. Similarly for exactly zero or four.

Wait, but condition III includes an even number, including zero, two, and four. So to express that, I would need to OR together the cases for 0, 2, and 4. But without negation, how can I represent zero being true? Because zero means all variables are false, which would require negations. So I don't think that's possible.

Wait, another approach: using only p's, can I express even parity? For four variables, even parity is true when an even number are true. The standard way to express even parity is (p1 XOR p2 XOR p3 XOR p4), but XOR isn't allowed here. Alternatively, it can be expressed using AND and OR, but again, that might not be possible without negation.

Let me consider that without negation, you can't express any condition that isn't a monotonic function. Since even parity is not monotonic (adding a true can flip it from true to false and vice versa), it can't be expressed with just AND and OR. So condition III can't be expressed without negation.

Wait, but wait another thought. What about expressing it as a disjunction of all possible even cases? But for that, I need to write all combinations where 0,2,4 are true. For zero, all p's are false, but without negation, I can't express that. Because to say p is false, you need ¬p. So without negation, I can't express any condition where a variable is false. So for example, the case where all four are false (0) can't be expressed. Similarly, for exactly two, I need to say two are true and the other two are false, which requires ¬ on the other two. So without negation, I can't express any of those cases.

So condition III cannot be expressed using only ∧ and ∨ without ¬.

So let me recap:

Condition I: Yes, can be expressed. For at least three, write all possible combinations of any three or all four being true. Since each is a conjunction of three or four, you can OR them all together.

Condition II: Yes. Exactly three. So for each triplet of variables being true, write their conjunction and OR all those terms.

Condition III: No. Because it requires expressing cases where some variables are false, which would need negation.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about condition III. Maybe there's a way. Suppose I don't need to check for exactly even, but any even number. But without using negation, it's impossible because you can't express that a variable is not true. So for any condition that requires at least one variable to be false, you can't express it without negation.

So condition III is not possible. So the options are:

Looking at the options, which conditions can be expressed.

The question is which of the conditions I, II, III can be expressed. So condition I and II can be expressed, but III cannot.

Looking at the options:

Option F: Only I and II.

Option J: I and II.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: None of the above

B: All of the above

C: I and III

D: Only II and III

E: III only

F: Only I and II

G: I only

H: II and III

I: II only

J: I and II

Wait, Option F is "Only I and II", which is the same as Option J: "I and II". Wait, no, looking again: Option F says "Only I and II" which I think is the same as saying I and II. So both F and J seem similar, but looking at the letters, perhaps F is "Only I and II", while J is "I and II". Wait, no, the way the options are written:

Wait the options are labeled A to J, each with a description. Let me recheck:

A: None

B: All

C: I and III

D: Only II and III

E: III only

F: Only I and II

G: I only

H: II and III

I: II only

J: I and II

Wait, perhaps F and J are similar but F says "Only I and II", which would imply that only I and II can be expressed, excluding III. J says "I and II", but perhaps F is "Only I and II", which may mean the same as J.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I concluded that conditions I and II can be expressed, but III cannot. So the correct answer would be that conditions I and II can be expressed, and III cannot. So the options that include I and II but not III would be either F or J.

Wait, let me check the exact wording of the options.

Option F: Only I and II.

Option J: I and II.

Hmm, perhaps "Only I and II" in F implies that only those two are expressible, which aligns with our conclusion. So the correct option is F.

Wait another thing. Let me make sure about condition I. At least three being true. So the Boolean formula would be the OR of all possible combinations where exactly three are true, plus the case where all four are true.

Wait, but when you have four variables, the case where all four are true is a separate term. So the formula would be (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4) ∨ (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4). Wait, but actually, the four-term conjunction is already covered by the three-term ones because if all four are true, then any three of them would also be true. So when you take the OR, the four-term case is redundant. So the formula can be written as the OR of all four choose three terms.

But wait, no. Because each three-term conjunction is true only when exactly those three are true and the fourth can be anything. Wait, no, because if you have p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3, that's true when p1, p2, p3 are true, regardless of p4. So if p4 is also true, that term is still true. So when you OR all four choose three terms, each of which includes any three being true, then the overall formula will be true in any case where at least three are true, including when all four are true.

So condition I can be expressed as the OR of all four possible three-variable conjunctions. So condition I is expressible.

So, to recap:

I: Yes

II: Yes

III: No

So the correct answer is the option where only I and II are correct. Looking at the options, that's option F: Only I and II.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake about condition III. Let me think again. Is there any way to express an even number of variables being true without using negation?

Wait, perhaps using a formula that combines all possible even cases. For four variables, the even cases are 0, 2, 4. But without negation, I can't express 0 (all false), 2 (two true, two false), or 4 (all true). Wait, but 4 is all true, which is p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ∧ p4. So that term can be expressed. For 2, I can't express exactly two without negation because I can't enforce the other two being false. So for exactly two, it's impossible without negation. Same for 0. So the even cases can't be fully expressed because you can't cover 0 and 2. So condition III is impossible.

Thus, the correct answer is option F: Only I and II.

To determine which conditions can be expressed using a Boolean formula with variables \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) and the connectives \( \land \) and \( \lor \) (without \( \neg \)), we analyze each condition:

### Condition I: At least three of \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) are true.
This condition includes the cases where exactly three or exactly four of the variables are true. It can be expressed as the disjunction of all possible combinations of three variables being true, along with the case where all four are true. For example:
\[
(p_1 \land p_2 \land p_3) \lor (p_1 \land p_2 \land p_4) \lor (p_1 \land p_3 \land p_4) \lor (p_2 \land p_3 \land p_4) \lor (p_1 \land p_2 \land p_3 \land p_4).
\]
Thus, Condition I can be expressed without negation.

---

### Condition II: Exactly three of \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) are true.
This condition is similar to Condition I but excludes the case where all four variables are true. It can be expressed as the disjunction of all combinations where exactly three variables are true:
\[
(p_1 \land p_2 \land p_3) \lor (p_1 \land p_2 \land p_4) \lor (p_1 \land p_3 \land p_4) \lor (p_2 \land p_3 \land p_4).
\]
Thus, Condition II can also be expressed without negation.

---

### Condition III: An even number of \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) are true.
This condition includes the cases where 0, 2, or 4 of the variables are true. However, expressing this without negation is not possible. For example:
- The case where 0 variables are true (all false) requires negation to express.
- The case where exactly 2 variables are true requires negation to enforce the other two being false.
- The case where 4 variables are true can be expressed as \( p_1 \land p_2 \land p_3 \land p_4 \), but the other cases cannot be expressed without negation.

Since negation is not allowed, Condition III cannot be expressed.

---

### Conclusion:
- Condition I can be expressed.
- Condition II can be expressed.
- Condition III cannot be expressed.

The correct answer is **Option F: Only I and II**.

**Answer: F**
