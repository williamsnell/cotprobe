Okay, so I've got this problem here about an electric iron connected to a power line. The question is asking about the power being used. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the iron has a resistance of 24 ohms, and it's plugged into a 120-volt line. I remember that power in electricity can be calculated in a few different ways. The most common formulas I know are P = V * I, P = V²/R, and P = I² * R. Since I have the voltage and the resistance, maybe I should use the formula that involves those two.

Wait, right, the formula P = V squared divided by R. Yeah, that makes sense because I don't have the current here, so using V and R would be easier. So P equals V squared over R. Let me jot that down.

So V is 120 volts. Squaring that gives me 120 * 120. Let me calculate that. 120 times 120 is 14,400. Oh wait, because 100 times 100 is 10,000, and 20 squared is 400, but wait, no, 120 is 100+20, so (100+20)^2 is 100^2 + 2*100*20 + 20^2, which is 10,000 + 4,000 + 400 = 14,400. Yeah that's right.

Now divide that by R, which is 24 ohms. So 14,400 divided by 24. Hmm, I need to compute that. Let me think: 24 times 600 is 14,400 because 24*600 is like 24*6*100, which is 144*100=14,400. So 14,400 divided by 24 is 600. Oh wait, so the power is 600 watts?

But wait, let me double-check. Another way to find power is P = V * I, but I don't have current. Oh, but I can find I using Ohm's law, which is V = I * R. So I is V/R. So I would be 120 volts divided by 24 ohms. Let me calculate that: 120 /24 is 5 amperes. Then P = V * I = 120 *5 = 600 watts. Same answer.

Wait, so both methods give me 600 watts. That seems consistent. So the power being used is 600 watts.

Looking at the options, option A is 600 watts. So the correct answer should be A.

The electric iron has a resistance of 24 ohms and is connected to a 120-volt line. To calculate the power being used, the formula \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \) is applied. Substituting the given values:

\[
P = \frac{120^2}{24} = \frac{14,400}{24} = 600 \, \text{watts}.
\]

This result is consistent with an alternative calculation using \( P = V \cdot I \), where \( I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{120}{24} = 5 \, \text{A} \), and \( P = 120 \cdot 5 = 600 \, \text{watts} \).

Thus, the power being used is 600 watts, which corresponds to option A.
