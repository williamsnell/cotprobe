Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about blood groups. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question says that the M, MN, and N blood groups are determined by two codominant alleles, L^m and L^n. Oh wait, codominant means both alleles are expressed in the phenotype, right? So for each person, their blood type depends on which alleles they have.

In a population of 800 college students, the data is:

- M: 392
- MN: 336
- N: 72

And the total is 800, which adds up because 392 + 336 is 728, plus 72 makes 800. Okay, that checks out.

The question is asking to determine the frequency of the L^m and L^n alleles. So, I think I need to calculate the allele frequencies using the Hardy-Weinberg principle. But wait, how does that apply here?

In the case of codominant alleles, each phenotype corresponds to a genotype as follows:

- M would be L^m L^m (homozygous for L^m)
- MN would be L^m L^n (heterozygous)
- N would be L^n L^n (homozygous for L^n)

So first, I can calculate the genotype frequencies from the given data.

Let's break it down:

Number of M (L^m L^m): 392 → so the frequency is 392/800.

Similarly, MN (L^m L^n) is 336/800.

N (L^n L^n) is 72/800.

Wait, but with codominant alleles, the heterozygotes will express both traits, which is why they're MN.

Now, according to Hardy-Weinberg, p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1, where p is the frequency of L^m and q for L^n.

In this case, p^2 is the frequency of M, which is 392/800. Similarly, q^2 is 72/800. And 2pq is the frequency of MN, 336/800.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the phenotype is determined by the genotype, and since the alleles are codominant, each phenotype directly reflects the genotype. So, the frequencies of the genotypes are as given.

So then, to find p (frequency of L^m) and q (L^n), I can use the genotype frequencies.

p^2 = frequency of M = 392/800 → p = sqrt(392/800)
Similarly, q^2 =72/800 → q = sqrt(72/800)

But wait, there's another approach. Alternatively, the allele frequency can be found by counting the alleles.

Each person has two alleles. So the total alleles in the population are 800 * 2 = 1600.

Number of L^m alleles: 

- Each M (392) has 2 L^m → 392 *2 =784
- Each MN (336) has 1 L^m → 336 *1=336
- N has 0 → 0

So total L^m alleles =784 +336 =1120 → frequency p =1120 /1600 → 1120 ÷1600 =0.7 → p=0.7 → L^m is 70% frequency.

Similarly, L^n:

Each N has 2 L^n →72 *2=144
Each MN has 1 →336 *1=336
M has 0 →0

Total L^n →144 +336=480 → q=480/1600=0.3 → 30%.

So p=0.7, q=0.3.

Looking at the options, which option has L^m=0.7 and L^n=0.3. Let me check the options:

Option G says 0.7 and 0.3. So the correct answer would be G.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Total students:800 → 1600 alleles.

M:392 → each contributes 2 L^m → 784.

MN:336 → each contributes 1 L^m → 336. So total L^m = 784 +336 =1120. 1120 /1600 = 0.7 → yes.

Similarly, for L^n:

N:72 → 2 each →144.

MN:336 →1 each →336.

Total L^n=144+336=480 →480/1600=0.3 → yes.

So the frequencies are 0.7 and 0.3, which is option G.

To determine the frequencies of the \( L^m \) and \( L^n \) alleles in the population, we use the given phenotype data and the relationship between genotype and phenotype under codominance. The phenotypes correspond to the following genotypes:

- **M**: \( L^mL^m \) (homozygous for \( L^m \))
- **MN**: \( L^mL^n \) (heterozygous)
- **N**: \( L^nL^n \) (homozygous for \( L^n \))

### Step 1: Calculate genotype frequencies
The total population size is 800. The number of individuals in each phenotype is:

- **M**: 392
- **MN**: 336
- **N**: 72

The genotype frequencies are:

\[
\text{Frequency of } M = \frac{392}{800}, \quad \text{Frequency of } MN = \frac{336}{800}, \quad \text{Frequency of } N = \frac{72}{800}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate allele frequencies
Each individual has two alleles, so the total number of alleles in the population is:

\[
\text{Total alleles} = 800 \times 2 = 1600.
\]

#### Frequency of \( L^m \) (\( p \)):
- \( L^m \) alleles come from:
  - **M**: Each \( L^mL^m \) individual contributes 2 \( L^m \) alleles. Total \( L^m \) alleles from M: \( 392 \times 2 = 784 \).
  - **MN**: Each \( L^mL^n \) individual contributes 1 \( L^m \) allele. Total \( L^m \) alleles from MN: \( 336 \times 1 = 336 \).
- Total \( L^m \) alleles: \( 784 + 336 = 1120 \).

The frequency of \( L^m \) is:

\[
p = \frac{\text{Total } L^m \text{ alleles}}{\text{Total alleles}} = \frac{1120}{1600} = 0.7.
\]

#### Frequency of \( L^n \) (\( q \)):
- \( L^n \) alleles come from:
  - **N**: Each \( L^nL^n \) individual contributes 2 \( L^n \) alleles. Total \( L^n \) alleles from N: \( 72 \times 2 = 144 \).
  - **MN**: Each \( L^mL^n \) individual contributes 1 \( L^n \) allele. Total \( L^n \) alleles from MN: \( 336 \times 1 = 336 \).
- Total \( L^n \) alleles: \( 144 + 336 = 480 \).

The frequency of \( L^n \) is:

\[
q = \frac{\text{Total } L^n \text{ alleles}}{\text{Total alleles}} = \frac{480}{1600} = 0.3.
\]

### Step 3: Match with the options
The calculated allele frequencies are \( p = 0.7 \) for \( L^m \) and \( q = 0.3 \) for \( L^n \). Comparing this with the options, the correct choice is:

**G: 0.7 for \( L^m \) and 0.3 for \( L^n \).**
