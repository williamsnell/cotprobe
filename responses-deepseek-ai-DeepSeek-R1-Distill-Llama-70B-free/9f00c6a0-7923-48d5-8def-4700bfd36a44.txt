Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the vertex of a pentagon P' after reflecting the original pentagon P across the line y = x. The original vertices of P are given at (–2, –4), (–4, 1), (–1, 4), (2, 4), and (3, 0). I'm a bit rusty on reflections across lines, but I think I remember that reflecting a point over y = x swaps the x and y coordinates. Let me think about that.

So reflection across y = x means that each point (a, b) becomes (b, a), right? Because the line y = x is like a mirror where the x and y axes swap places. So for each vertex, I just swap the coordinates.

Let me go through each point one by one.

The first point is (-2, -4). Swapping gives (-4, -2). Looking at the options, option D is (-4, -2). That's one possible answer, but I need to check all the points to make sure.

Next point: (-4, 1). Swapping gives (1, -4). Hmm, looking at the options, F is (-1, -4), which is different. So that's not an option here. So my transformed point (1,-4) isn't in the options, but let's continue.

Third point: (-1,4). Swapping gives (4, -1). None of the options match that. Wait, option E is (4, -2), which is close but not the same.

Fourth point: (2,4) becomes (4,2). Option C is (4,1), which is not the same. Option I is (1,4), which is the original point of the third vertex when swapped.

Wait, no. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check. The point (2,4) becomes (4,2), right? So looking at the options, option C is (4,1), which isn't it. Option A is (2,2), which is also not. So none of the options match this transformed point.

Fifth point: (3,0). Swapping gives (0,3). Looking at the options, G is (0, -3), which is different. So that's not it.

Wait, so the only transformed point that's in the options is (-4, -2), which is option D. But let me make sure I didn't miss any.

Wait, the question says "one of the vertices of P’ is..." So perhaps more than one is present, but the correct answer is among the options given. So I'll check each original point again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the reflection might not be just swapping. Oh wait, no, reflection over y = x is definitely swapping x and y. So for each point (x,y), the reflection is (y,x). So I'm confident that's correct.

So the transformed points are:

(-2, -4) → (-4, -2) → option D.

(-4, 1) → (1, -4) → not an option.

(-1,4) → (4,-1) → not an option.

(2,4) → (4,2) → not an option.

(3,0) → (0,3) → not an option.

So looking at the options provided, only option D is present. So the correct answer must be D: (-4, -2).

Wait, but looking back at the options, option E is (4,-2) and option C is (4,1). So no, D is the only match.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's re-do the first point: (-2, -4) → after reflection, (x,y) becomes (y,x) → (-4, -2). Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the vertices of the pentagon P' after reflecting pentagon P across the line y = x, we use the property that reflecting a point (a, b) across y = x results in the point (b, a). Applying this transformation to each vertex of P:

1. **(-2, -4)** → **(-4, -2)**  
   Option D matches this transformed point.

2. **(-4, 1)** → **(1, -4)**  
   None of the options match this point.

3. **(-1, 4)** → **(4, -1)**  
   None of the options match this point.

4. **(2, 4)** → **(4, 2)**  
   None of the options match this point.

5. **(3, 0)** → **(0, 3)**  
   None of the options match this point.

Among the given options, only **(-4, -2)** (Option D) corresponds to one of the transformed vertices of P'. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: (-4, -2)**

D
