Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about calculating the diameter of a steel rod, specifically AISI-C1035, which I think is a type of carbon steel. The rod needs to resist both a steady axial load and a fluctuating load. Oh right, axial load means it's being pulled or compressed along its length.

The steady load is 7500 lbs. And the fluctuating load goes from 0 to 12,500 lbs. So that means the load varies, creating alternating stress. Stress concentration is a factor here because of the fillet radius. The stress concentration factor (Kf) is given as 2.1 for a fillet radius of 1/8 inch. I remember that stress concentrations occur where there's a sudden change in the geometry of a part, like a notch or a fillet. These areas can cause higher localized stresses, which can lead to fatigue failure under fluctuating loads.

The factor of safety (FS) is 2.1. Factor of safety is the ratio of the failure stress to the design stress, so it's a margin to account for uncertainties and variations.

I think the approach here is to use the Soderberg equation or the Goodman line for fatigue failure, considering both the steady and fluctuating stresses. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on which one is which. Let me think. The Soderberg equation relates the alternating stress (Sa) and the mean stress (Sm) to the yield strength (Sy) and the ultimate strength (Su). The equation is Sa/(Su) + Sm/(Sy) = 1/FS. Or wait, maybe it's Sa/(Su) + Sm/(Sy) = 1/FS. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: the factor of safety might be applied differently. Since the rod is under both steady and fluctuating loads, the stress will have a mean component and an alternating component. So the mean stress (Sm) would be the steady stress, and the alternating stress (Sa) would be half the fluctuating load.

But wait, the fluctuating load goes from 0 to 12,500 lbs. So the maximum load is 12,500, and the minimum is 0. So the alternating stress Sa is (12,500 - 0)/2 = 6250 lbs. And the mean stress Sm is (12,500 + 0)/2 = 6250 lbs. No wait, no, because the steady load is 7500. So I'm mixing two things. Let me clarify.

Wait, the rod has a steady axial load of 7500 lbs. So that's a constant stress, Sm. Then there's a fluctuating load that goes from 0 to 12,500 lbs. So the fluctuating part would add to the steady load. Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. So the fluctuating load is varying between 0 and 12,500. So the total load at any time is the sum of the steady 7500 and the fluctuating part. Or is the fluctuating load in addition to the steady? Or is the fluctuating load separate? Hmm, the question says "a steady axial load of 7500 lbs., and a fluctuating load from 0 to 12,500 lbs." So perhaps it's a combined load. Wait, no, the way it's phrased, the fluctuating part is separate. So the total load varies between 7500 + 0 =7500 and 7500 + 12,500 = 20,000 lbs. No, wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the steady load is 7500, and the fluctuating load varies from 0 to 12,500. So the maximum total load would be 7500 + 12,500 = 20,000 lbs, and the minimum is 7500 + 0 = 7500 lbs. Wait, that would mean the mean load is (20,000 + 7500)/2 = 13,750 lbs, and the alternating component is (20,000 - 7500)/2 = 6,250 lbs. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the fluctuating load is separate from the steady load. So the steady load is 7500 lbs, and the fluctuating part is varying between 0 and 12,500. So the total load varies between 7500 and 7500 + 12,500 = 20,000. So yes, the mean stress would be (7500 + 20,000)/2 = 13,750 lbs, and the alternating stress would be (20,000 -7500)/2 = 6,250 lbs. That seems correct.

Wait, but the problem says "a fluctuating load from 0 to 12,500 lbs." So I think that the fluctuating part is varying between 0 and 12,500. So the mean of the fluctuating part is 6,250, and the steady part is 7,500. So the total mean stress would be 7,500 + 6,250 = 13,750? Or is it that the mean stress is 7,500 plus half of 12,500, which is 6,250? That doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps the fluctuating load is superimposed on the steady load. So the total load varies from 7500 +0=7500 to 7500 +12500=20000. So the mean stress would be (7500 +20000)/2 = 13750 lbs, and the amplitude is (20000-7500)/2=6250 lbs. That makes sense.

So now, the mean stress Sm is 13,750 lbs, and the alternating stress Sa is 6,250 lbs.

But wait, the stress concentration factor Kf is 2.1. So the actual stresses are Kf times the nominal stresses.

Wait, the nominal stress is based on the applied load and the diameter. So the nominal stress would be F/A, where F is the force and A is the cross-sectional area. But the actual stress is Kf times that. So when considering failure, the actual stress must be within the allowable limits, considering factor of safety.

Alternatively, perhaps we should calculate the equivalent stress considering the stress concentration.

Wait, I think it's better to approach this using the endurance limit or the Goodman line. The Goodman equation relates the alternating stress and mean stress to the ultimate strength and yield strength.

The Goodman equation is:

Sa / Su + Sm / Sy = 1

But wait, that might be without considering stress concentration. Also, the factor of safety comes into play.

Alternatively, considering that stress concentration is present, the effective stress would be higher. So perhaps we should adjust the allowable stresses by the stress concentration factor.

Wait, another approach: the maximum stress in the rod will be the nominal stress multiplied by Kf. So to find the allowable nominal stress, we can divide the material's strength by Kf and the factor of safety.

But let's think step by step.

First, I need the material properties for AISI/SAE 1035 steel. Let me recall. AISI 1035 is a carbon steel with a carbon content around 0.35%. Its mechanical properties are typically: Ultimate Tensile Strength (Su) around 85,000 to 90,000 psi. Yield Strength (Sy) around 50,000 psi. But I should check exact values, but perhaps the problem expects me to know or perhaps to use standard values.

Wait, maybe the problem provides these values somewhere? Oh, I don't think so. So perhaps I should proceed with typical values. Let me assume Su = 90,000 psi and Sy = 55,000 psi. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look up typical values. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use Su=90,000 psi and Sy=60,000 psi. Hmm, perhaps it's better to proceed with Su=90,000 psi and Sy=60,000 psi.

Wait, I think for SAE 1035 steel, the ultimate tensile strength is about 90,000 psi (620 MPa), and the yield strength is approximately 60,000 psi (410 MPa). So I'll go with those numbers: Su=90,000 psi, Sy=60,000 psi.

Now, the factor of safety is 2.1, so the allowable stresses would be Su / FS and Sy / FS.

But wait, in fatigue calculations, we often use the endurance limit. The endurance limit (Se) is the stress level below which the material can withstand an infinite number of cycles without failure. For steels, the endurance limit is typically around 0.5 Su for components with smooth surfaces. However, surface finish, stress concentrations, and other factors reduce this value.

But in this problem, the stress concentration factor Kf is given as 2.1, so the endurance limit would be adjusted by that.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The stress concentration reduces the endurance limit. So the effective endurance limit Se' = Se / Kf. But Se is usually 0.5 Su for steels with smooth surfaces. So Se = 0.5 * 90,000 = 45,000 psi. Then Se' = 45,000 / 2.1 ≈ 21,428 psi.

But then again, the presence of a mean stress affects this. So perhaps the Goodman equation is more appropriate here, considering both the alternating and mean stresses.

The Goodman equation is:

Sa / Se' + Sm / Su = 1 / FS

Wait, no, the Goodman equation relates the alternating stress and mean stress to the ultimate tensile strength. The standard Goodman equation is:

Sa / Su + Sm / Su = 1

But when considering the endurance limit, perhaps it's better to use:

Sa / Se + Sm / Sy = 1

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me look up the correct form. Wait, I can't look things up, but I'll try to recall. The Goodman line is a linear relationship between the alternating stress and mean stress. It's expressed as:

Sa / Su + Sm / Su = 1

But that's without considering stress concentration. Alternatively, in the presence of stress concentration, the effective Su would be lower, so perhaps:

Sa / (Su / Kf) + Sm / (Su / Kf) = 1 / FS

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to compute the equivalent stress due to the mean and alternating components, considering stress concentration, and then apply the factor of safety.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of the maximum stress. The maximum stress occurs when the load is at its maximum. So the maximum load is 20,000 lbs (7500 + 12,500). The stress would be F/A = 20,000 / (π d²/4) = (80,000)/ (π d²). But wait, that's the nominal stress. The actual stress considering stress concentration would be Kf times that, so Kf * (80,000)/(π d²).

This actual stress must be less than or equal to the yield strength divided by the factor of safety. Because if the stress exceeds yield, the material will plastic deform. So perhaps the maximum stress should not exceed Sy / FS.

Wait, but that's for static loading. Since this is a fatigue situation, perhaps we need to consider both static and fatigue limits.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the equivalent stress amplitude considering mean stress, using the Goodman equation, and then relate that to the endurance limit adjusted for stress concentration and factor of safety.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Calculate the nominal mean stress (Sm_nominal) and nominal alternating stress (Sa_nominal) based on the loads.

2. Apply the stress concentration factor to get actual mean and alternating stresses: Sm = Kf * Sm_nominal, Sa = Kf * Sa_nominal.

3. Using the Goodman equation, relate Sa and Sm to the ultimate strength, considering the factor of safety.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

- Determine the nominal stresses due to the fluctuating and steady loads.

- Apply the stress concentration factor to these nominal stresses to get the actual stresses.

- Then, using the Goodman equation, ensure that Sa/(Su/FS) + Sm/(Su/FS) ≤ 1.

Wait, that might make sense. Because the Goodman line is Sa/Su + Sm/Su = 1, so with a factor of safety, perhaps we use (Sa + Sm) / (Su/FS) ≤ 1, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the Goodman equation with factor of safety would be Sa/(Su/FS) + Sm/(Sy/FS) ≤ 1. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think about the maximum and minimum stresses.

Wait, the maximum load is 20,000 lbs, the minimum is 7500 lbs. So the mean stress is (20,000 + 7500)/2 = 13,750 lbs. The alternating stress is (20,000 - 7500)/2 = 6,250 lbs.

The nominal mean stress Sm_nominal = 13,750 / A, where A is the cross-sectional area.

The nominal alternating stress Sa_nominal = 6,250 / A.

But considering stress concentration, the actual mean Sm = Kf * Sm_nominal, and actual Sa = Kf * Sa_nominal.

Then, using the Goodman equation, which is:

Sa / Su + Sm / Su = 1 / FS

Wait, that's considering the factor of safety. So substituting:

(Kf * Sa_nominal) / Su + (Kf * Sm_nominal) / Su = 1 / FS

Because both Sa and Sm are multiplied by Kf, we can factor that out:

Kf * (Sa_nominal + Sm_nominal) / Su = 1 / FS

But wait, that's not correct because the Goodman equation is Sa/Su + Sm/Su = 1, and with FS, perhaps it's Sa/(Su/FS) + Sm/(Su/FS) =1.

Wait, no. The Goodman equation without FS is Sa/Su + Sm/Su =1. So when considering a factor of safety, we could write:

Sa/(Su/FS) + Sm/(Su/FS) ≤ 1

Which simplifies to (Sa + Sm) * FS/Su ≤ 1

So (Sa + Sm) ≤ Su / FS

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Another approach is to treat the mean and alternating stresses in terms of the Goodman line.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to express the equivalent stress amplitude as:

Sa_eq = Sa * (1 + Sm/Sy)

But I'm not confident about that.

Alternatively, the Soderberg equation is:

Sa/(Su) + Sm/(Sy) = 1/FS

Wait, that sounds more accurate. Soderberg's equation is:

Sa/(Su) + Sm/(Sy) = 1/n

Where n is the factor of safety.

So in this case, with FS = 2.1, the equation becomes:

Sa/(90,000) + Sm/(60,000) = 1/2.1

But wait, Sa and Sm here are the actual stresses, which include the stress concentration factor.

So, Sa = Kf * (F_alternating / A)

Sm = Kf * (F_mean / A)

So substituting:

[Kf*(F_alt/A)]/(90,000) + [Kf*(F_mean/A)]/(60,000) = 1/2.1

We can factor out Kf/A:

Kf/A [ (F_alt / 90,000) + (F_mean / 60,000) ] = 1/2.1

We can solve for A, then find the diameter.

Let's compute F_mean and F_alt.

F_mean is the mean load, which is (7500 + 20000)/2 = 13750 lbs.

F_alt is the alternating load, which is (20000 -7500)/2 = 6250 lbs.

So substituting:

Kf = 2.1

A = π d² /4

So substituting:

2.1/( (π d²/4) ) [ (6250 / 90,000) + (13750 / 60,000) ) ] = 1/2.1

Let me compute each term.

First, compute (6250 /90,000):

6250 ÷ 90,000 ≈ 0.069444

Then, (13750 /60,000):

13750 ÷60,000 ≈ 0.2291667

Sum: 0.069444 + 0.2291667 ≈ 0.2986107

So equation becomes:

2.1/( (π d²/4) ) * 0.2986107 ≈ 1/2.1

Simplify.

Multiply both sides by (π d²/4):

2.1 * 0.2986107 ≈ (1/2.1) * (π d²/4)

Compute 2.1 * 0.2986107 ≈ 0.626482

And 1/2.1 ≈ 0.47619

So:

0.626482 ≈ 0.47619 * (π d²/4)

Divide both sides by 0.47619:

0.626482 / 0.47619 ≈ (π d²/4)

Compute 0.626482 / 0.47619 ≈ 1.315

So:

1.315 ≈ (π d²)/4

Multiply both sides by 4:

5.26 ≈ π d²

So d² ≈ 5.26 / π ≈ 1.676

d ≈ sqrt(1.676) ≈ 1.295 inches

So about 1.295 inches in diameter.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H: 1 5/8 inches, which is 1.625 inches. But wait, 1.295 is approximately 1 5/16, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, the sum inside the brackets was 0.069444 + 0.2291667 = 0.2986107.

So 2.1 times that is 2.1 * 0.2986107 ≈ 0.626482, correct.

Then, on the right-hand side, 1/2.1 ≈ 0.47619.

So equation: 0.626482 = 0.47619 * (π d²/4)

So (π d²/4) = 0.626482 / 0.47619 ≈ 1.315

So d² = (1.315 *4 )/ π ≈ (5.26)/3.1416 ≈ 1.674

d ≈ sqrt(1.674) ≈ 1.294 inches, which is about 1.294 inches.

Looking at the options:

A: 1 1/4 = 1.25

B:1 7/8=1.875
