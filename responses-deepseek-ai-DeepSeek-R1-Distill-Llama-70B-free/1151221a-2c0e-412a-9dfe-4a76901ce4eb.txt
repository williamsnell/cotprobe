Question:

A pharmacist was employed by a drug store. A long-time customer of the drug store presented a prescription to the pharmacist for the medication Clinoril, which was prescribed by her physician to treat her arthritic condition. The pharmacist was in a rush that day because of a backlog of prescriptions to fill, and he misread the customer's prescription. He filled her prescription with Clinitest, a caustic substance not for internal use. He labeled the container with the instructions for Clinoril: "Take one tablet twice a day. "The customer followed the instructions, consumed the Clinitest, and suffered severe injuries to her stomach and esophagus. If the customer brings a strict liability in tort action against the pharmacist, what is his best defense?

Options:

A: The customer did not suffer any injuries due to the medication.
B: The customer did not ask for clarification about the medication.
C: The physician had prescribed the wrong medication.
D: The drug store was not the manufacturer upon whom ultimate liability falls.
E: The medication was properly labeled with the correct medication name.
F: It was the cashier and not he who personally received the money for the medication.
G: The customer should have been aware that the medication was not correct.
H: He was not a seller of the product upon whom strict liability may be imposed.
I: He exercised reasonable care under the circumstances.
J: The customer misread the label on the medication.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tort question about strict liability. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

So, there's a pharmacist who works at a drug store. A long-time customer comes in with a prescription for Clinoril, which is for her arthritis. The pharmacist was in a rush because he had a lot of prescriptions to fill and he misread the prescription. Instead of giving her Clinoril, he gave her Clinitest, which is a caustic substance not meant to be taken internally. He labeled it with the instructions for Clinoril, telling her to take one tablet twice a day. The customer followed these instructions and ended up with serious injuries to her stomach and esophagus.

Now, the customer is suing the pharmacist under strict liability in tort. The question is, what's the pharmacist's best defense?

I remember that strict liability in tort usually applies in cases where the defendant is engaged in an abnormally dangerous activity or when they are in the business of selling products. For strict product liability, there are three main types: manufacturing defects, design defects, and failure to warn. But in this case, the issue seems to be a mistake in filling the prescription, which points more towards a manufacturing defect or possibly negligence.

Wait, but the pharmacist isn't the manufacturer, right? The pharmacist is more like a seller or distributor. So maybe the question is about whether the pharmacist, as a seller, can be held strictly liable. I think under strict product liability, anyone in the chain of distribution can be held liable, including manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. So the pharmacist, as the seller, could be strictly liable unless there's a defense.

But the question is about the pharmacist's defense. So what defenses are available in strict liability cases? Generally, the main defenses are assumption of risk, misuse of the product, or that the product wasn't defective when it left the defendant's hands.

In this case, the product was Clinitest, which is a caustic substance not meant to be ingested. So it's a completely wrong product. The pharmacist filled the wrong medication, so the product is defective because it's not what was prescribed.

Wait, but strict liability can apply when the product has a defect that makes it unreasonably dangerous. Here, the product (Clinitest) was given in place of the prescribed Clinoril. So the defect is that it's the wrong product, which is a manufacturing defect in a way, but more accurately, it's a mistake in the filling process.

But the pharmacist is the one who made the mistake. So under strict liability, the seller (pharmacist here) can be held liable regardless of fault, as long as the product was defective and caused injury.

So what defenses does the pharmacist have? Let me look at the options.

Option A: The customer didn't suffer any injuries. But the facts say she did, so this is incorrect.

Option B: The customer didn't ask for clarification. I'm not sure if that matters. In strict liability, the focus is on the product's defect, not on the customer's actions unless it's contributory negligence, which varies by jurisdiction. But in strict liability, contributory negligence isn't a defense. So this might not help.

Option C: The physician prescribed the wrong medication. Wait, the prescription was for Clinoril, and the pharmacist misread it. So the mistake was the pharmacist's, not the doctor's. So this defense wouldn't apply because the pharmacist's error caused the wrong drug to be dispensed.

Option D: The drug store wasn't the manufacturer. But as I thought before, strict liability can apply to sellers as well, so being a non-manufacturer doesn't absolve them. This might not be a good defense.

Option E: The medication was properly labeled. But he labeled it as Clinoril, which was correct for the drug he was supposed to give, but he gave Clinitest. So the label was correct for the intended drug, but the contents were wrong. So the labeling isn't the issue; the contents are. So this might not be a good defense.

Option F: It was the cashier, not him, who took the money. I don't think that matters. Strict liability is about the product's defect, not about who handled the payment.

Option G: The customer should have known the medication was wrong. This sounds like an assumption of risk argument. If the customer should have noticed, but in this case, she's a long-time customer, and the medication was labeled correctly. She might not have had any reason to doubt it. So this defense might not hold because the misfilling was in the pill, not the label. Unless the pills looked very different, but the question doesn't say that.

Option H: He wasn't a seller upon whom strict liability can be imposed. Wait, I thought that anyone in the chain can be strictly liable. But perhaps pharmacists are considered learned intermediaries, and maybe there's a different standard. Or maybe if the pharmacist is an employee, the employer (drug store) is the seller, not the pharmacist individually. This is an interesting point. If the pharmacist is an employee, then the drug store would be the seller, and the pharmacist himself might not be considered a seller for strict liability purposes. So maybe the pharmacist isn't the seller, so strict liability doesn't apply to him.

Option I: He exercised reasonable care. But strict liability doesn't depend on care; it's about the product being defective. So if he was negligent, that's a different claim, but for strict liability, showing he was careful doesn't matter. Unless the defect arose because of something beyond his control, but here the defect was his mistake.

Option J: The customer misread the label. But the label was correct for Clinoril, so she followed it. So this isn't applicable.

So going back, the options. The question is about the best defense. So which option is correct.

Option H says he wasn't a seller upon whom strict liability may be imposed. If that's true, then he cannot be held strictly liable because strict liability applies to sellers, manufacturers, etc. But as a pharmacist, is he considered a seller?

Wait, in some cases, pharmacists are considered part of the chain of distribution. So they can be held strictly liable. But maybe as an individual pharmacist, rather than the store, the strict liability would apply to the business entity, not the individual employee. However, I'm not entirely sure about that. But if strict liability applies to the seller, which is the drug store, then the pharmacist as an individual might not be liable under strict liability.

Alternatively, if the pharmacist was acting within the scope of his employment, the employer (drug store) would be vicariously liable, and the pharmacist might not be personally liable under strict liability. So in that case, the defense would be that he's not a seller, so option H is correct.

Another angle: strict liability for product defects generally applies to commercial sellers. If the pharmacist is an employee, not the commercial seller, then he might not be liable. So option H could be the best defense.

Alternatively, if the pharmacist is an independent contractor, but in this case, he's employed by the drug store, so likely the store is the seller.

So considering this, the pharmacist's best defense would be that he isn't the seller, so strict liability doesn't apply to him. Therefore, the answer would be H.

Wait, but let me think again. Another possible angle is the "learned intermediary" doctrine. In pharmaceutical cases, the manufacturer's duty to warn is satisfied if the warning is given to the prescribing physician, because the pharmacist is a learned intermediary who can provide warnings. But in this scenario, the issue isn't a failure to warn but a wrong product being dispensed. So that doctrine might not apply here.

So going back, the best defense is H: He was not a seller upon whom strict liability may be imposed.

In this case, the pharmacist filled the wrong medication, substituting Clinoril with Clinitest, a caustic substance not intended for internal use. The customer followed the instructions on the label, which were correct for Clinoril but entirely inappropriate for Clinitest, leading to severe injuries. The customer is bringing a strict liability claim against the pharmacist. 

Strict liability in tort applies to sellers and manufacturers in the chain of distribution for defective products that cause injury. However, the pharmacist, as an individual, may not qualify as a "seller" in this context. Typically, strict liability applies to the business entity (in this case, the drug store) rather than the individual pharmacist, who is acting as an employee. If the pharmacist is not considered a commercial seller, strict liability would not apply to him personally. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect, as the customer clearly suffered injuries.
- **B**: Irrelevant, as strict liability focuses on the product defect, not the customer's actions.
- **C**: Incorrect, as the physician prescribed Clinoril, and the error was the pharmacist's misreading of the prescription.
- **D**: Incorrect, as strict liability can apply to sellers, including the drug store, regardless of whether it is the manufacturer.
- **E**: Incorrect, as the label was correct for Clinoril but not for Clinitest, which was the defect.
- **F**: Irrelevant, as strict liability is about the product defect, not who handled payment.
- **G**: Unlikely, as the customer had no reason to doubt the medication given the correct labeling.
- **H**: Correct, as strict liability applies to commercial sellers, and the pharmacist, as an employee, may not be considered a seller.
- **I**: Incorrect, as strict liability does not depend on the exercise of reasonable care.
- **J**: Incorrect, as the customer followed the correct label instructions for Clinoril.

The best defense is that the pharmacist was not a seller upon whom strict liability may be imposed, making **H** the correct answer.
