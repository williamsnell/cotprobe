Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to pulleys and forces, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again: We have a 100-N crate being lifted with an ideal pulley system by pulling a rope downward with 25 N of force. The question is, for every 1 meter of rope pulled down, how much does the crate rise?

Hmm. Alright, I remember that pulley systems can change the force needed to lift an object, but I also think they affect the distance you have to pull the rope. Let me think about how pulleys work. 

In an ideal pulley system, there's no friction, and the massless rope doesn't stretch. So the mechanical advantage comes from the number of ropes supporting the load. Wait, in this case, how many ropes are attached to the crate? The problem doesn't specify, but usually, if you're pulling down, it's a single pulley system unless stated otherwise. Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me think.

Wait, when you have a single pulley, the force required is the same as the weight divided by the number of ropes. But wait, no, wait. No, wait. Sorry, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. 

In a single pulley system, the effort (force applied) is equal to half the weight of the load because the rope is looped around the pulley, so you have two segments of rope pulling up. So the mechanical advantage is 2. That would mean that the force needed is F = W/2. 

But in this problem, the force applied is 25 N, and the weight is 100 N. So if F = W/2, then W would be 2*F. So 2*25 is 50 N, but wait the crate is 100 N. That doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. If the pulley provides mechanical advantage, then the force you apply is less than the weight. So if the mechanical advantage is 2, then F = W/2. So if W is 100 N, then F would be 50 N. But in the problem, the force applied is only 25 N. So that suggests a mechanical advantage of 4, because 100/4 is 25. 

Wait, but how does that relate to the number of ropes? The mechanical advantage (MA) is equal to the number of ropes supporting the load. So MA = number of ropes. So if MA is 4, that would mean four ropes are lifting the load. But wait, is that possible? 

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think. In a typical pulley setup, each time the rope loops around the pulley, it adds a segment. So for a single pulley, you have two rope segments (one on each side of the pulley) pulling up, so MA is 2. If you have a compound pulley system with more pulleys, you can get more segments. For example, two pulleys might give 3 or 4 segments, depending on the setup.

But wait, the problem says it's an ideal pulley system, so we can ignore friction and weight of the pulleys. So the key is to find the mechanical advantage, which is the ratio of the load to the effort. So MA = W / F. Here, W is 100 N, F is 25 N. So MA = 100 / 25 = 4. So the mechanical advantage is 4. That means that the number of rope segments lifting the load is 4.

Now, in pulley systems, the distance the load moves is inversely proportional to the number of rope segments. So if you have N segments, then when you pull the rope down a distance D, the load moves up D/N. Because each segment of the rope has to move that distance, but the load is moved by each of the N segments contributing a D/N movement.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let's think. Suppose you have a single rope segment (no pulley), you pull 1 m, the load moves 1 m. If you have two segments (like a single pulley), pulling 1 m, the load moves 0.5 m. Because you have two segments each being pulled 1 m, so the total movement at the load is 0.5 m.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you have two rope segments, you're pulling both ends. Wait, no, in a single pulley setup, you have one rope that goes over the pulley, so pulling 1 m of rope from one side would cause the load to rise by 0.5 m. Because the rope is moving on both sides. So for each meter you pull, the load goes up half a meter.

Wait no, wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose you have a single fixed pulley. You have a rope that goes over it, one end attached to the load, the other you pull. So when you pull the rope down 1 m, the load moves up 1 m. Because the rope moves through the pulley. Wait, that can't be right because that would give a mechanical advantage of 1, which is no advantage. But that's not correct because a single pulley does change the direction of the force, but doesn't change the amount of force needed. So maybe I've been getting this wrong all along.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify. A single pulley allows you to change the direction of the force, but without changing the amount of force needed. So the effort is same as the weight. So if the load is 100 N, you need to pull with 100 N. But in the problem, the effort is 25 N, which is much less than the load. So that suggests that the mechanical advantage is 4. So the number of rope segments is 4.

Wait, but how does that work? Let me imagine a compound pulley system with more than one pulley. Each additional pulley can add more rope segments. For example, with two pulleys, you can have a mechanical advantage of 3 or 4, depending on how the ropes are arranged.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of the distance. So, mechanical advantage MA is the ratio of the load to the effort, so MA = W / F. So here, W=100 N, F=25 N, so MA = 4. So the number of rope segments supporting the load is 4. That means that for every meter of rope pulled, the crate moves up 1/4 meters, which is 25 cm. So the correct answer would be D: 25 cm.

Wait, but let me make sure. So, the distance moved by the crate is the distance pulled divided by the mechanical advantage. So if MA is 4, then for every 1 m pulled, the crate rises 0.25 m, which is 25 cm.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be D: 25 cm. Let me check the options. Option D is 25 cm, so that's correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze the pulley system and its mechanical advantage. The crate weighs 100 N, and the force applied to pull the rope is 25 N. The mechanical advantage (MA) of the system is calculated as:

\[
\text{MA} = \frac{\text{Weight of crate}}{\text{Force applied}} = \frac{100 \, \text{N}}{25 \, \text{N}} = 4
\]

This means the pulley system provides a mechanical advantage of 4, implying there are 4 rope segments supporting the load. In pulley systems, the distance the crate moves is inversely proportional to the number of rope segments. Specifically, for every 1 meter of rope pulled, the crate rises:

\[
\text{Distance risen by crate} = \frac{\text{Distance pulled}}{\text{Mechanical advantage}} = \frac{1 \, \text{m}}{4} = 0.25 \, \text{m} = 25 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, for every 1 meter of rope pulled downward, the crate rises 25 cm. The correct answer is:

**D: 25 cm**
