Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Kohler's studies with apes. I remember that Kohler did some classic experiments, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

The question is asking what Kohler's studies demonstrated. The options are A through J. I remember that Kohler worked with chimpanzees, right? I think he was looking at problem-solving abilities. I recall something about them using tools or figuring out how to get food that's out of reach.

Wait, I think one of the experiments involved a chimpanzee using a stick to reach bananas that were placed outside its cage. So the ape used an object as a tool. That makes me think option A is a possibility. Option A says apes can use objects from their environment as tools. That sounds familiar.

But wait, another thing I remember is that Kohler's work was about insight learning. Oh right, he observed that the apes didn't just try random things until they worked. Instead, they seemed to have a moment of insight where they figured out the solution all at once. So that would relate to option C, which is about learning via insight.

Hmm, so the question is asking what Kohler's studies demonstrated. I think both A and C could be correct, but I need to pick one. Let me think. The question is about the main conclusion of his work. I remember that Kohler's main point was about insight learning, which is a type of cognitive process. So option C would be the correct answer.

Wait, but option A is about using tools, which is also something the apes did. So which one is more directly tied to Kohler's findings? I think the key here is that while the apes did use tools, the significant part was how they arrived at the solutionâ€”through insight rather than trial and error. So the demonstration was about the learning process, not just tool use.

Oh, right! Operant conditioning is about learning through rewards and punishment, which is more Skinner's work. So option B is out. Latent learning is when you learn without obvious rewards, like Tolman's maze experiments, so E is probably not it either.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be option C: that learning can occur via insight.

Kohler's studies with apes are best known for demonstrating that learning can occur via insight. While the apes did use objects as tools, the key finding was their ability to solve problems through sudden cognitive realizations rather than trial and error. This aligns with option C.

Answer: C
