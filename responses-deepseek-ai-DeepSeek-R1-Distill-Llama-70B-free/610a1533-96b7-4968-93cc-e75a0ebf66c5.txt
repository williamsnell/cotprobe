Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says: A certain element emits 1 alpha particle, and its products then emit 2 beta particles in succession. The atomic number of the resulting element is changed by which of the options given?

Hmm, I remember that atomic number refers to the number of protons in an atom's nucleus. Changes in the nucleus can affect this number. So I need to think about what happens when an atom emits alpha and beta particles.

First, I'll recall what an alpha particle is. An alpha particle is a helium nucleus, right? So it consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. When an atom emits an alpha particle, it's losing those 2 protons and 2 neutrons from its nucleus. That must mean the atomic number decreases by 2 because you're losing two protons. So if the original element has an atomic number Z, after emitting an alpha, it becomes Z-2.

But wait, the question mentions that after emitting the alpha, the product then emits two beta particles. So I need to consider what a beta particle is. A beta particle is an electron emitted from the nucleus when a neutron converts into a proton. So when a beta particle is emitted, a neutron turns into a proton, which increases the atomic number by 1 each time a beta is emitted.

So let's break it down. The initial element emits an alpha, so Z becomes Z-2. Then, it emits two beta particles in succession. Each beta emission adds 1 to the atomic number. So after the first beta, it's (Z-2) +1 = Z-1. After the second beta, it's (Z-1)+1 = Z. Wait, so that brings it back to the original Z?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the atomic number goes down by 2, then up by 2, the net change is zero. So the atomic number of the resulting element doesn't change? Or did I make a mistake?

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The initial element emits an alpha. So atomic number decreases by 2. Then, each beta adds 1. So after two betas, the total change is -2 +2 = 0. So the net change is zero. So the atomic number doesn't change.

Wait, but the question is asking by how much the atomic number is changed. If the net is zero, then the change is zero. So the answer would be that the atomic number doesn't change, which is option G.

Alternatively, let me consider an example to make sure. Let's say the original element is Uranium (U), which has an atomic number of 92. Uranium undergoes alpha decay. So emitting an alpha would make it Thorium (Th), which has an atomic number of 90. Because 92 - 2 = 90.

Then, if Thorium emits a beta particle, that's when a neutron turns into a proton. So atomic number increases by 1, becomes 91. Then another beta, so up to 92 again. So after emitting two beta particles, the atomic number goes back to 92. So the original element was U (92), after alpha and two betas, it's back to 92. So the atomic number ends up the same as it started.

Wait, but in the question, the element emits an alpha, then the product emits two betas. So the starting element is the original, which changes after each emission.

So the initial element's atomic number is Z. After alpha: Z-2. Then after two betas: Z-2 +2 = Z. So overall, the atomic number is the same as it was initially. So the change is zero.

Looking at the options, option J is 'zero', and option G says 'does not change', which is the same as zero. Wait, no, the options are A through J. Let me check again.

Wait, the options are:

A: minus 3

B: minus 2

C: minus 1

D: plus 1

E: plus 3

F: plus 2

G: does not change

H: plus 4

I: minus 4

J: zero

Wait, so G says 'does not change', and J says 'zero'. Are these the same? Well, in terms of the change, if the change is zero, then the atomic number doesn't change. So both options G and J would imply a net change of zero.

But wait, looking back, the initial change is Z → Z-2 (after alpha), then each beta adds 1. So after two betas, Z-2 + 2 = Z. So the net change is zero. So the change is zero, which would mean the answer is J (zero change), but G says 'does not change' which also implies a net change of zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look at the options again.

The question asks: The atomic number of the resulting element is changed by...

So the change is (final Z) - (initial Z) = 0. So the change is zero. So the answer is J: zero.

Alternatively, option G says 'does not change', which is correct because the atomic number ends up the same as the starting element.

Wait, but the problem is about the change. So the change is zero. So the correct answer would be J: zero.

Wait, but sometimes in such questions, the way it's phrased can matter. The "change by" could refer to the net effect. So if the original is Z, and the final is Z, then the change is zero.

So the correct answer should be J: zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the sequence. Let me think again.

Original element: Z.

Emits alpha → Z-2.

Then emits two beta particles. Each beta increases Z by 1.

So after first beta: (Z-2)+1= Z-1.

After second beta: Z-1 +1= Z.

So the final Z is same as initial. So the change is zero. So the answer is J.

But wait, looking at the options, both G and J might seem correct. Because G says "does not change", which is correct, and J says "zero", which is also correct.

Wait, perhaps the options are worded differently. Let me check the options as presented.

Options:

A: minus 3

B: minus 2

C: minus 1

D: plus 1

E: plus 3

F: plus 2

G: does not change

H: plus 4

I: minus 4

J: zero

So the question asks, the atomic number is changed by... So the change is final Z minus initial Z, which is zero. So the change is zero, which is option J.

But another way: the atomic number doesn't change (G) is correct, so the change is zero (J). So which option is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think.

After emitting alpha and two betas, the Z is the same as initial. So the change is zero. So the correct answer is J.

But wait, I've seen similar problems where after an alpha and two betas, the Z increases by zero. So the net change is zero.

So I think the answer is J.

To determine how the atomic number changes when an element emits 1 alpha particle followed by 2 beta particles, we analyze the effects of each type of emission:

1. **Alpha Emission**: An alpha particle consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. When an atom emits an alpha particle, it loses 2 protons from its nucleus, decreasing its atomic number by 2. If the initial atomic number is \( Z \), after emitting an alpha particle, the atomic number becomes \( Z - 2 \).

2. **Beta Emission**: A beta particle is an electron emitted when a neutron in the nucleus converts into a proton. Each beta emission increases the atomic number by 1 because the number of protons increases. Since the element emits 2 beta particles in succession, the atomic number increases by \( +2 \).

Combining these effects:
- After the alpha emission: \( Z - 2 \).
- After the first beta emission: \( (Z - 2) + 1 = Z - 1 \).
- After the second beta emission: \( (Z - 1) + 1 = Z \).

Thus, the final atomic number is the same as the initial atomic number, meaning the net change in the atomic number is **zero**.

From the given options:
- Option G states "does not change," which is correct because the atomic number ends up the same as it started.
- Option J states "zero," which is also correct because the net change in the atomic number is zero.

Since the question explicitly asks for the change in the atomic number, the most precise answer is **J: zero**.

Answer: J
