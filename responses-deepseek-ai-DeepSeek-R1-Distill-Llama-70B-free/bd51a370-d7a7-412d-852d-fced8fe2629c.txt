Question:

A firm in a perfectly competitive industry has patented a new process for making widgets. The new process lowers the firm's average cost, meaning that this firm alone (although still a price taker) can earn real economic profits in the long run. Suppose a government study has found that the firm's new process is polluting the air and estimates the social marginal cost of widget production by this firm to be SMC = 0.5q. If the market price is $20, what should be the rate of a government-imposed excise tax to bring about optimal level of production?

B: 18
C: 8
D: 2
E: 4
F: 20
G: 10

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a firm in a perfectly competitive industry that's patented a new process for making widgets. This process lowers their average cost, allowing them to make economic profits even in the long run because they're the only ones with this process. But there's a catch: their new process is polluting, and the government study found the social marginal cost (SMC) to be 0.5q. The market price is $20, and we need to find the optimal excise tax rate to correct this.

Hmm, okay, so first, I remember that in a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers. That means they can't set the price; they just take the market price as given. But this firm has a cost advantage because of the new process, so they can make profits even in the long run. Wait, but normally in perfect competition, profits are zero in the long run because firms enter the market until profits are driven to zero. But this firm has a patent, so other firms can't copy the process. So they're like a monopoly in terms of their production process, but they still face the market price as a price taker. Interesting.

Now, the problem is about pollution. The firm's production is creating a negative externality because it's polluting the air. So the social marginal cost is the cost to society, which includes the firm's private marginal cost plus the marginal external cost. But in this case, the SMC is given as 0.5q. Wait, I think I might be mixing things up. Oh right, in cases of externality, the social marginal cost (SMC) is the sum of the private marginal cost (PMC) and the marginal external cost (MEC). But here, the problem states that the SMC is 0.5q, which I suppose is the marginal damage from pollution.

Wait, perhaps the firm's private marginal cost is lower than the social marginal cost because they're not bearing the cost of pollution. So the government wants to impose an excise tax to make the firm internalize this externality. The goal is to bring the firm's private marginal cost up to the level of the social marginal cost so that they produce the optimal quantity.

In a perfectly competitive market without any externalities, the firm would produce where price equals marginal cost. But with the externality, the firm's marginal cost is lower than the social cost, so they produce more than the socially optimal quantity. To correct this, the government can impose a tax that makes the firm's marginal cost equal to the social marginal cost.

So, the optimal tax should make the firm's marginal cost after tax equal to the SMC. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The firm's supply curve is based on their private marginal cost. Without the tax, they produce where P = PMC. But with the tax, the PMC would increase by the amount of the tax, so the new PMC becomes PMC + tax. We want this new PMC to equal the SMC at the optimal quantity.

Wait, wait. Let me put it into equations. Let me denote the firm's private marginal cost as PMC. Normally, without any tax, the firm produces where P = PMC. But with the tax, the firm's cost per unit increases by the tax rate, so their new marginal cost is PMC + t, where t is the tax per unit. We want PMC + t = SMC at the optimal output level.

But wait, in this question, the SMC is given as 0.5q, and the market price is $20. So, the optimal output is where SMC equals the market price. Because in the optimal case, the price that society is willing to pay (which is the value of the marginal product) should equal the social marginal cost. So, setting P = SMC would give the optimal quantity.

So, let’s find the optimal quantity first. The SMC is 0.5q, and the market price is $20. So, setting 0.5q = 20. Solving for q gives q = 40. So the optimal quantity is 40 units.

Now, without any tax, the firm would produce where P = PMC. But we don't know the firm's PMC yet. Wait, the firm's average cost has decreased due to the new process, but that doesn't directly tell us about their marginal cost. Hmm, perhaps I need to figure out what the firm's PMC is without the tax.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give us the firm's private marginal cost. It just gives the SMC. So maybe I'm supposed to assume that the firm's private marginal cost is less than the SMC because they're not accounting for the pollution. So, the firm's PMC without tax is lower than the SMC.

Wait, but the tax is supposed to make the firm's PMC + tax = SMC at the optimal output. So, at the optimal quantity q=40, SMC is 0.5*40 = 20. So, the tax should make the firm's PMC at q=40 plus tax equal to 20.

Wait, but without the tax, the firm would have produced where P = PMC. Since the market price is 20, they would produce where PMC = 20. But wait, that's the same as the SMC at q=40. So, if the firm's PMC is such that at q=40, PMC is 20, then the tax would be zero because SMC is already 20 there. But that can't be right because the problem states that the firm is causing pollution, implying that their production without tax is beyond the socially optimal point.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. If the firm's PMC is lower than the SMC at every level of production, then without a tax, the firm would produce more than the socially optimal quantity. So, the socially optimal quantity is where SMC = demand (price). So, when q=40, SMC is 20, which equals the market price.

But without the tax, the firm's PMC is lower than SMC. So, the firm's PMC(q) is, say, PMC = 0.5q - something? Or perhaps the SMC is their PMC plus the marginal external cost. Wait, yes. SMC = PMC + MEC. So, in this case, SMC is 0.5q. So, perhaps the MEC is 0.5q, and the PMC is lower, maybe zero or something else? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the firm's private marginal cost is zero, but that's not realistic. Alternatively, maybe the firm's private marginal cost is lower than 0.5q.

Wait, perhaps the firm's private marginal cost is zero, and the SMC is 0.5q, which is the MEC. But that can't be, because then the firm would produce as long as price is positive, leading to a huge overproduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the firm's private marginal cost is, say, 0.2q, and the MEC is 0.3q, so SMC is 0.5q. But the problem doesn't specify that. It only gives SMC as 0.5q.

Wait, perhaps I should model it differently. The firm's private marginal cost is some function, and the social marginal cost is 0.5q. So, without a tax, the firm produces where P = PMC. But with the tax, they produce where P = PMC + tax. We want the tax to make sure that at the optimal q, the PMC + tax = SMC.

Wait, but the optimal q is where SMC = P, which is 20. So, when q is 40, SMC is 20. So, the firm's PMC at q=40 plus the tax should equal 20.

But without knowing the firm's PMC, how can I find the tax? Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the firm's private marginal cost is zero in this scenario, meaning that they don't have any production costs beyond the fixed costs. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the firm's marginal cost curve is below the SMC curve, so without the tax, they produce more than the social optimum. So, the tax should be set such that the firm's new marginal cost (PMC + tax) intersects the demand (price) at the same point where SMC intersects demand.

Wait, so let's try this approach. The optimal output is where SMC = P, so 0.5q = 20 → q=40.

Now, without the tax, the firm would produce where P = PMC. Let's say the firm's PMC is, I don't know, maybe PMC = 0.5q - t, but that's not making sense. Wait, no, the tax adds to the firm's cost. So, after the tax, the firm's marginal cost becomes PMC + t.

Wait, perhaps the firm's original PMC is less than SMC at q=40. So, the idea is to tax them so that at q=40, PMC + t = 20.

But without knowing the firm's PMC, how can I calculate t? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. The social marginal cost is 0.5q, and the market price is $20. So, the optimal output is where SMC equals price, which is 0.5q = 20 → q=40.

Now, the firm, without any tax, would produce where their private marginal cost equals the market price. Let's say their private marginal cost is lower than the SMC. So, their PMC is less than 0.5q at every q.

Wait, but without knowing their PMC function, how can I find the tax? Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the tax should be set equal to the marginal external cost at the optimal output level. Wait, but the marginal external cost is the difference between SMC and PMC. But again, without knowing PMC, maybe the tax is the difference between SMC and the market price? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the tax should be set so that the firm's after-tax marginal cost equals the SMC at the optimal quantity. So, at q=40, the tax per unit t would make the firm's PMC + t = SMC.

But without knowing PMC at q=40, I can't compute t. Therefore, perhaps the question is implying that the firm's private marginal cost is zero, and the SMC is 0.5q, so the tax would be 0.5q at the optimal q.

Wait, let me think differently. The problem states that the firm has a new process that lowers their average cost, allowing them to make economic profits. So, their marginal cost must be lower than the market price at the quantity they choose to produce.

In a perfectly competitive market, the firm's supply curve is their marginal cost curve. So, without any tax, the firm would produce where P = PMC.

But with the tax, the firm's new marginal cost becomes PMC + t. So, the quantity produced would be where P = PMC + t.

We want this quantity to be the optimal one, which is where SMC = P. So, the optimal q is 40, as we found earlier.

So, at q=40, the firm's PMC must satisfy P = PMC + t → 20 = PMC(40) + t.

But we don't know PMC(40). Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the firm's PMC is zero? That can't be right, because then the tax would be 20, which is option F, but that seems too high.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the firm's private marginal cost is the same as SMC without the pollution. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the firm's private marginal cost is the same as SMC minus the MEC, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the question is simpler than that. The optimal tax is the amount that makes the firm's marginal cost equal to the social marginal cost at the optimal quantity. So, the tax should be the difference between SMC and the firm's PMC at that point.

But without knowing the firm's PMC, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that in the absence of the tax, the firm's private marginal cost is zero, so the tax should be equal to SMC at q=40, which is 20. But that would make the tax 20, which is option F. But that doesn't seem right because the options don't have 20 as the correct choice, perhaps.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are A:14, B:18, C:8, D:2, E:4, F:20, G:10, H:12, I:16, J:6.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it another way. The social marginal cost is 0.5q. The market price is $20. So, the optimal output is where 0.5q = 20, which is q=40. Now, without any tax, the firm would produce where P = PMC. So, if the firm's PMC is lower than 20 at q=40, they would produce more than 40 units, causing excess pollution. So, the tax should be set so that the firm's PMC + tax equals 20 at q=40. 

But the problem is that we don't know the firm's PMC at q=40. Wait, perhaps the firm's average cost is lowered, but their marginal cost might be zero? No, that's not realistic. Alternatively, perhaps the firm's marginal cost is 10 at q=40, so the tax would need to be 10 to make it 20. But I'm just guessing here.

Alternatively, maybe the tax is the marginal external cost at the optimal output level. Since SMC = PMC + MEC, and if we're to set PMC + t = SMC, then t = MEC. But again, without knowing MEC or PMC, I can't compute it.

Wait, perhaps the question is misworded, and the SMC is actually the marginal external cost. If that's the case, then the tax should be equal to the MEC at the optimal output. So, if SMC is 0.5q, and that's the MEC, then at q=40, the MEC is 20. So, the tax would be 20, but that's option F. But that seems high because the market price is 20, so the tax per unit is 20, which would make the firm's cost 40 per unit, which is higher than the price, leading them to produce nothing. That can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the welfare loss. The firm is producing beyond the socially optimal point because they don't account for the externality. The tax should bring their production down to the optimal level.

So, without the tax, the firm's production is where P = PMC. Let's say that without the tax, the firm produces q1 where P = PMC(q1). But the optimal is q=40 where SMC(q)=20.

So, the tax should make the firm's new PMC + t = 20 at q=40. So, PMC(40) + t = 20 → t = 20 - PMC(40).

But without knowing PMC(40), I can't find t. Therefore, perhaps the question expects us to assume that the firm's private marginal cost is zero. If that's the case, then t would be 20. But that's option F, which is $20. That seems too high, and probably not the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the firm's private marginal cost is the same as the market price without the tax, implying that they produce where P = PMC, but that would mean PMC(40) = 20, so the tax would be zero. But that can't be right because the SMC is higher than the PMC.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the firm's average cost with marginal cost. The problem says the new process lowers the firm's average cost, but that doesn't necessarily tell us about the marginal cost. So, perhaps the firm's marginal cost is lower than the market price, allowing them to make a profit.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the optimal tax is the amount that makes the firm's marginal cost equal to the social marginal cost at the optimal output. So, if the optimal output is q=40, then the tax per unit would be the difference between SMC at q=40 and the firm's PMC at q=40.

But again, without knowing the firm's PMC, I can't compute the tax. So perhaps the problem is missing some information, or I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the firm's private marginal cost is zero because the new process is so efficient. So, their marginal cost is zero, and the social marginal cost is 0.5q. So, the tax would be 0.5q at q=40, which is 20. So, the tax would be $20 per unit, which is option F. But that seems really high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the tax is the marginal external cost at the optimal output. If SMC is 0.5q, and the firm's PMC is 0 (unrealistic, but maybe), then the MEC is 0.5q, so the tax per unit at q=40 is 20. Again, same result.

But I'm not confident about this. Let me think of another approach. The optimal tax should internalize the externality, so it should be set equal to the marginal external cost at the optimal output level. So, if the marginal external cost is 0.5q, then at q=40, the MEC is 20. So, the tax would be 20 per unit. That would make the firm's marginal cost after tax equal to the market price at q=40, which is optimal.

But again, this leads me to option F:20. But the options include lower numbers. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the optimal output. Let me check that again. The optimal output is where SMC equals the market price. SMC is 0.5q, and market price is 20. So, 0.5q =20 → q=40. That seems correct.

Wait, maybe the tax is the difference between the market price and the SMC at the optimal point. But in this case, they're equal, so the tax would be zero. That can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the tax is the value of the externality per unit at the optimal output. If the externality is 0.5 per unit, then at q=40, the total externality is 20, but the tax per unit would be 0.5, not 20.

Wait, that's a different approach. The tax per unit should be equal to the marginal external cost at the optimal output. So, if the marginal
