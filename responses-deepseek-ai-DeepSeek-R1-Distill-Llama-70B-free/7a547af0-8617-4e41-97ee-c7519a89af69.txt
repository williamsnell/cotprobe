Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the SEC regulations regarding audit committees. Hmm, I remember that the SEC has specific rules about what audit committee members can and cannot do. Let me think through each option.

The question is asking which action members of an issuer's audit committee may not do according to the SEC. The options are A through F.

Starting with option A: "Establish procedures for the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal controls, or auditing matters." I think the SEC actually requires audit committees to have such procedures in place. So maybe this is something they can do, meaning it's not the correct answer.

Option B: "Engage independent counsel as deemed necessary to carry out their duties." I recall that audit committees are allowed to hire their own advisors, including legal counsel, if they think it's necessary. So this is permitted, not prohibited.

Option C: "Accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the registrant for services other than as a member of the board." Wait, the SEC has rules about independence. If a committee member is receiving fees beyond their board compensation, that might create a conflict of interest. I think they can't accept such fees, so this might be the correct answer.

Option D: "Serve on the board of directors of another company." I don't think the SEC prohibits this outright. It's more about independence from the company they're auditing, not other boards. So this is probably allowed.

Option E: "Establish procedures for employees to anonymously report fraud." Yes, I'm pretty sure this is a requirement. The audit committee should have a way for whistleblowers to report issues confidentially. So they can do this, making it not the answer.

Option F: "Serve on more than three audit committees of public companies." Wait, I'm not sure about this. There's a limit on the number of audit committees a member can serve on? Or is it about independence? I think the SEC might have a limit, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the NYSE or other exchange rules rather than the SEC. Hmm, but the question is about the SEC specifically.

Wait, back to option C. The SEC's rules on audit committees, especially for public companies, require that all members are independent. Independence means they can't have certain relationships with the company, like being a current executive or having certain financial ties. Receiving consulting or advisory fees would compromise their independence, so they can't accept such fees except for their board service. So option C is what they may not do.

So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is C. According to the SEC, members of an issuer’s audit committee may not accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the registrant for services other than as a member of the board, as this would compromise their independence.

Answer: C
