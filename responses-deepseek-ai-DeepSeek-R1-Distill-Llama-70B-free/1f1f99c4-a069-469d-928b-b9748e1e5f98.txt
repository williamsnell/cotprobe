Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me about the equilibrium conversion of nitrogen to ammonia in a catalytic converter. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem gives me the reaction: N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3. The converter is operated at 100 atm and 350°C. The equilibrium constant K is 14.4e-5 at 500°C, but wait, the reaction is at 350°C. Oh, right, the ΔH is given as -25,800 cal/g-mol. So I think I'll need to adjust the K value for the temperature change because K is temperature-dependent.

Wait, the standard states are pure components at 1 atm. So when the problem says to assume ideal-gas and Lewis-Randall behavior, that probably means I should use the ideal gas law for the activities, right? So activity would be based on partial pressures.

But wait, the reaction is at 100 atm, but K is given at 500°C. I need to find K at 350°C. Oh, right, I should use the van 't Hoff equation to adjust K with temperature.

The van 't Hoff equation is ln(K2/K1) = -ΔH°/(R) [1/T2 - 1/T1]. Wait, but ΔH is in cal/(g-mol). Oh, right, R is usually in J, so I need to convert units. Let me think, R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K), I think. Or wait, 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is about 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

So given:
- K1 at T1=500°C = 773 K
- ΔH° = -25,800 cal/g-mol. Wait, per gram-mole, so that's per mole basis.
- T2 is 350°C = 623 K.

So plugging into van 't Hoff:

ln(K2/K1) = (-ΔH°) / (R) * (1/T2 - 1/T1)

Wait, wait, wait. ΔH is negative because the reaction is exothermic. So the equation should be correct as written.

Wait, let's compute each term.

Compute 1/T1 and 1/T2:
1/773 ≈ 0.001294
1/623 ≈ 0.001604

So 1/T2 -1/T1 = 0.001604 - 0.001294 = 0.00031.

Then, ( -ΔH° ) / R = (25800 cal/mol) / (1.987 cal/mol·K) ≈ 25800 / 1.987 ≈ about 13,000.

Wait, because ΔH° is negative, it's - (ΔH°) = 25800.

So 25800 / 1.987 ≈ let's calculate that: 25800 divided by 2 is 12900, so 25800/1.987 is roughly around 13,000. Let me compute more accurately.

1.987 times 13,000 is 25,831. So that's pretty close to 25,800. So approximately 13,000.

So ln(K2/K1) ≈ 13,000 * 0.00031 = approximately 4.03.

Wait, 13,000 * 0.00031 is 4.03. So ln(K2/K1) = 4.03.

Wait wait, no: the equation is ln(K2/K1) = [ -ΔH° / R ] * [1/T2 - 1/T1 ]

Wait, no, because the van 't Hoff equation is:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ) / ] * (1/R) ?

Wait, maybe I should double-check the van 't Hoff equation. Oh, right, the correct form when ΔH is at standard conditions is:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ) ] / (1)

But wait, actually, it's:

ΔG° = -RT ln K. And ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°. So combining these with the van 't Hoff equation.

Alternatively, the van 't Hoff equation is:

d(ln K)/d(1/T) = -ΔH°/R.

So integrating from T1 to T2:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ) ]

Wait, no, wait: the equation is (ΔH°/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) when ΔH is the enthalpy change at temperature T. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused about the sign.

Wait, let me think again. The van 't Hoff equation in the form:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R) [ (1/T1 - 1/T2) / ] * (1/(1)), assuming ΔH is constant with temperature.

Wait, but ΔH is given as -25800 cal/mol. So plugging that in:

ln(K2/K1) = (-25800 cal/mol) / (1.987 cal/mol·K) ) * (1/773 - 1/623 )

Wait, wait no—the equation I think is:

ln(K2/K1) = (ΔH°/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

So let's compute (1/T1 - 1/T2) first.

1/773 ≈ 0.001294
1/623 ≈ 0.001604
So (1/T1 - 1/T2) = 0.001294 - 0.001604 = -0.00031.

Now, ΔH° is -25800 cal/mol. So ΔH°/R is (-25800) / 1.987 ≈ -12980.2.

Multiply that by (-0.00031):

(-12980.2) * (-0.00031) = approx 4.0242.

So ln(K2/K1) ≈ 4.0242.

Which implies K2 = K1 * e^(4.0242).

K1 is 14.4e-5. So let's compute e^4.024. e^4 is about 54.598. e^4.024 is a bit more. Let's say approximately 54.8.

So K2 ≈ 14.4e-5 * 54.8 ≈ 14.4e-5 * 55 = approx 792e-5.

Wait, let's compute 14.4e-5 *54.8:

14.4 *54.8 = let's compute 14 *54.8 = 767.2, 0.4 *54.8=21.92, so total is 789.12. So 789.12e-5 → 7.8912e-3.

Wait, but wait: 14.4e-5 is 0.000144. Multiply by 54.8 gives 0.000144 *54.8=0.00789 approximately.

So K2 ≈ 0.00789.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I did the van 't Hoff correctly. Let me double-check the signs. Because when the reaction is exothermic (ΔH negative), increasing temperature should decrease K, because Le Chatelier's principle says the system will shift to counteract the change. So going from 500°C (higher T) to 350°C (lower T), K should increase. Because at lower temperatures, exothermic reactions are favored. So K at lower T is higher than at higher T. So our calculation of K2=0.00789 makes sense because K1 was 14.4e-5 (0.000144), and 0.00789 is larger.

So now, K at 350°C is about 0.00789.

Wait, but I'm a bit concerned about the units for ΔH. Because sometimes, the van 't Hoff equation uses ΔH in J, not cal. Oh, wait, I used R in cal units, so that's correct.

Now, with K at 350°C being approximately 0.00789.

Next, let's model the equilibrium. The reaction is N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3.

Assuming the initial moles are 1 mole N2 and 3 moles H2, since the stoichiometry is 1:3. So initial moles: n_N2 =1, n_H2=3, n_NH3=0.

At equilibrium, let's let x be the moles of N2 that react. So:

N2: 1 - x
H2: 3 - 3x
NH3: 2x

But wait, the pressure is 100 atm, but the activities are based on partial pressures. Wait, but when dealing with Kp, the expression is in terms of partial pressures.

Alternatively, Kp is calculated as (P_NH3)^2 / (P_N2 * P_H2^3).

But wait, the ideal gas assumption allows us to write the partial pressures as (n_i * P_total)/n_total.

Alternatively, using the concept of mole fractions. But perhaps it's easier to express everything in terms of extent of reaction.

Wait, another approach is to start by assuming the reaction occurs in a vessel where the initial moles are 1 N2 and 3 H2, so total initial moles are 4.

At equilibrium, moles are:

N2: 1 - x
H2: 3 - 3x
NH3: 2x

Total moles = (1 -x) + (3 -3x) + 2x = 4 -2x.

The partial pressure of each component is (moles of component / total moles) * P_total.

So P_N2 = (1 - x)/ (4 - 2x) * 100 atm
P_H2 = (3 - 3x)/(4 - 2x) * 100 atm
P_NH3 = (2x)/(4 - 2x) * 100 atm

Then, Kp is [ (2x/(4-2x) * 100 )^2 ] / [ ( (1-x)/(4-2x)*100 ) * ( (3-3x)/(4-2x)*100 )^3 ) ]

Simplify this expression.

Let's factor out the 100 terms. The denominator for each partial pressure is (4-2x), so each P_i is (n_i / (4-2x)) * 100.

So Kp = [ (2x/(4-2x) *100 )^2 ] / [ ( (1-x)/(4-2x) *100 ) * ( (3-3x)/(4-2x)*100 )^3 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (2x)^2 * 100^2 / (4-2x)^2
Denominator: (1-x) * (3-3x)^3 * 100^(1+3) ) / (4-2x)^(1+3)
So denominator becomes (1-x)(3-3x)^3 *100^4 / (4-2x)^4.

So putting together:

Kp = [ (4x² * 100²) / (4-2x)^2 ) ] / [ ( (1-x)(3-3x)^3 * 100^4 ) / (4-2x)^4 ) ]

Simplify the division: multiply numerator by reciprocal of denominator.

Kp = [4x² * 100² * (4-2x)^4 ) ] / [ (4-2x)^2 * (1-x)(3-3x)^3 *100^4 ) ]

Simplify terms:

- (4-2x)^4 / (4-2x)^2 = (4-2x)^(4-2) = (4-2x)^2
- 100² / 100^4 = 1/100²
- So:

Kp = [4x² * (4-2x)^2 ] / [ (1-x)(3-3x)^3 ) * 100² ]

Hmm, but this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this.

Alternatively, let's define the conversion of N2 as 'x', which is the fraction that reacts. So the moles would be similar as before, but perhaps expressing in terms of x.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use extent of reaction and express the mole fractions.

Alternatively, let me think in terms of partial pressures.

Let me denote the initial moles as 1 mole N2, 3 moles H2, and 0 moles NH3. The total initial moles are 4.

At equilibrium, the change is:

N2: -x
H2: -3x
NH3: +2x

So moles at equilibrium:

N2: 1 - x
H2: 3 - 3x
NH3: 2x

Total moles: 4 - 2x.

The partial pressure of each gas is (moles / total moles) * P_total.

So,

P_N2 = (1 - x) * 100 / (4 - 2x)
P_H2 = (3 - 3x) * 100 / (4 - 2x)
P_NH3 = (2x) * 100 / (4 - 2x)

Now, writing the expression for Kp:

Kp = (P_NH3)^2 / ( P_N2 * (P_H2)^3 )

Substituting the expressions:

Kp = [ (2x * 100 / (4-2x))^2 ] / [ ( (1 - x)*100/(4-2x) ) * ( (3 - 3x)*100/(4-2x) )^3 ) ]

Let me simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator:
(2x * 100)^2 / (4-2x)^2

Denominator:
(1 - x)*100/(4-2x) * [ (3-3x)*100/(4-2x) )^3 ]

So denominator becomes:
(1 - x) * (3-3x)^3 * 100^4 / (4-2x)^4.

So Kp becomes:

[ (4x² * 100²) / (4-2x)^2 ) ] / [ (1 - x)(3 - 3x)^3 * 100^4 / (4 - 2x)^4 ) ]

Which is:

[4x² * 100² * (4-2x)^4 ] / [ (4-2x)^2 * (1 - x)(3 - 3x)^3 * 100^4 ) ]

Simplify the terms:

- (4-2x)^4 / (4-2x)^2 = (4-2x)^(2)
- 100² / 100^4 = 1/100²
- So:

Kp = [4x² * (4-2x)^2 ] / [ (1 - x)(3 - 3x)^3 * 100² ]

But I think I made a mistake in the denominator's exponent. Let me recheck.

Wait, the denominator after substitution is:

(1 - x) * [ (3 - 3x) ]^3 * [100]^4 / (4 - 2x)^4.

So when I invert the denominator, it becomes (4 - 2x)^4 / [ (1 - x)(3-3x)^3 * 100^4 ) ].

So when I multiply numerator by that, the numerator's (4-2x)^2 * (4-2x)^4 from denominator inversion gives (4-2x)^(2+4) = (4-2x)^6? Wait, no, wait:

Wait, the numerator is [4x² * 100² ] / (4-2x)^2.

Denominator is [ (1 - x)(3-3x)^3 * 100^4 ] / (4-2x)^4.

So when you divide the two, it becomes [4x² * 100² / (4-2x)^2 ] * [ (4-2x)^4 ) / ( (1 - x)(3-3x)^3 * 100^4 ) ]

Which is:

4x² * 100² * (4-2x)^4 ) / [ (4-2x)^2 * (1 - x)(3-3x)^3 * 100^4 ) ]

Simplify exponents:

(4-2x)^4 / (4-2x)^2 = (4-2x)^(2)

100² / 100^4 = 1/100²

So Kp = [4x² * (4-2x)^2 ] / [ (1 - x) * (3-3x)^3 * 100² ]

Now, substituting the value of Kp we found earlier, which is approximately 0.00789.

So, 0.00789 = [4x² (4-2x)^2 ] / [ (1 - x)(3 - 3x)^3 * (100)^2 ]

Wait, but this seems really complicated. Maybe there's an assumption we can make to simplify this equation.

Since Kp is small (0.00789 is small), the reaction doesn't proceed much, so x might be small. If x is small, we can approximate terms like (1 - x) ≈ 1, (3 - 3x) ≈3, etc.

Let me try that. So assuming x is much less than 1, 3x much less than 3, so:

(1 - x) ≈ 1
(3 - 3x) ≈ 3
(4 - 2x) ≈4

So substituting these approximations:

Kp ≈ [4x² * (4)^2 ] / [ 1 * (3)^3 * (100)^2 ]

Compute denominator:

3^3 =27, 100^2=10000, so denominator is 27 * 10000 =270,000.

Numerator: 4x^2 * 16 =64 x^2.

So:

0.00789 ≈ (64 x²) / 270,000

Solve for x²: x² ≈ (0.00789 * 270,000 ) /64

Compute numerator: 0.00789 *270,000 = 0.00789 *2.7e5.

0.00789 *2.7e5 = 0.00789 *270,000.

Let me compute 270,000 *0.007 =
