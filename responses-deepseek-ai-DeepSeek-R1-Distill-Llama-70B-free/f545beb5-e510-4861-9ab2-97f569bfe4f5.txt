Question:

Apoptosis, which is programmed cell death, is a necessary process in living organisms. Which of the following is NOT correct about apoptosis?

Options:

A: It occurs randomly.
B: A particular cell dies when it is no longer needed by the organism.
C: A cell carries out apoptosis when too many mutations have accumulated.
D: Plant cells carry out apoptosis as a defense measure in cells that have been infected by parasites.

Okay, so I've got this question about apoptosis, which I remember is programmed cell death. Hmm, the question is asking which statement is NOT correct about apoptosis. Let's break it down.

The options are A to D. Let's go through each one.

Option A says apoptosis occurs randomly. Wait, I thought apoptosis is a programmed process, meaning it's not random. It's regulated by genes and happens when the cell is supposed to die, like during development. So if A says it's random, that might be incorrect. But I'm not sure yet.

Option B: A particular cell dies when it's no longer needed. That sounds right. Like how in the womb, fingers are webbed but then the cells between die to separate them. So B is correct.

Option C: Cell undergoes apoptosis when too many mutations have accumulated. Oh right, apoptosis is a way to prevent cancer. If a cell has too many mutations, especially in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, it can trigger apoptosis. So C is correct.

Option D: Plant cells use apoptosis as a defense against parasites. I remember something about the hypersensitive response in plants. When a parasite infects a plant cell, the plant cells around it die to prevent the spread. That's apoptosis, right? So D is correct.

Wait, so the incorrect statement would be the one that's not true. So A says apoptosis occurs randomly, which I think is wrong because it's a programmed, controlled process. So A is the incorrect statement.
</think>

Apoptosis is a programmed and regulated process of cell death, not a random event. It occurs in specific situations such as when a cell is no longer needed, has accumulated too many mutations, or as a defense mechanism in plants against parasites. The statement that apoptosis occurs randomly is incorrect because it contradicts the nature of apoptosis as a controlled biological process.

The incorrect statement is **A**.

Answer: A
