Question:

A tomato cannery has 5000 pounds of grade A tomatoes and 10,000 pounds of grade B tomatoes, from which they will, make whole canned tomatoes and tomato paste. Whole tomatoes must be composed of at least 80 percent grade A tomatoes, whereas tomato paste must be made with at least 10 percent grade A tomatoes. Whole tomatoes sell for $0.08 per pound and paste sells for $0.05 per pound. Formulate a linear program to solve for how much of each product to make, if the company wants to maximize revenue. (Hint: Let x_WA = pounds of A grade tomatoes used in whole tomatoes, x_WB = pounds of B grade tomatoes used in whole tomatoes; the amount of whole tomatoes produced can be found as x_WA + x_WB after x_WA and x_WB are chosen.)

Options:

A: the revenue is $.10 (X_WA + X_WB) + $.05 (X_PA + X_PB)
B: the revenue is $.05 (X_WA + X_WB) + $.08 (X_PA + X_PB)
C: the revenue is $.08 (X_WA + X_WB) + $.10 (X_PA + X_PB)
D: the revenue is $.08 (X_PA + X_PB) + $.05 (X_WA + X_WB)
E: the revenue is $.08 (X_WA) + $.05 (X_WB) + $.05 (X_PA) + $.05 (X_PB)
F: the revenue is $.07 (X_WA + X_WB) + $.04 (X_PA + X_PB)
G: the revenue is $.08 (X_WA + X_WB) + $.05 (X_PA + X_PB)
H: the revenue is $.08 (X_WA) + $.05 (X_PB)
I: the revenue is $.08 (5000 - X_WA) + $.05 (10000 - X_PB)
J: the revenue is $.09 (X_WA + X_WB) + $.06 (X_PA + X_PB)

Okay, so I've got this problem about a tomato cannery, and I need to figure out how to set up a linear program to maximize their revenue. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

Alright, the cannery has two types of tomatoes: 5000 pounds of grade A and 10,000 pounds of grade B. They're making two products—whole canned tomatoes and tomato paste. Each product has different requirements for the grade of tomatoes they can use.

So, the first thing I remember is that in linear programming, we need to define variables, an objective function (which here is revenue), and constraints based on the problem.

Let me think about the variables. The hint says to let x_WA be the pounds of A grade tomatoes used in whole tomatoes, and x_WB for B grade in whole tomatoes. Similarly, I guess we'll have x_PA and x_PB for the paste. Wait, but wait—do I need all four variables? Because the whole tomatoes are made from some combination of A and B, and the same for paste. Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the products. Like, for each product, how much of each tomato grade is used.

Wait, the problem says that whole tomatoes must be at least 80% grade A. So for whole tomatoes, the fraction of A tomatoes must be >=80%. That means x_WA >= 0.8*(x_WA + x_WB). Because the total whole tomatoes would be x_WA + x_WB, and 80% of that must be x_WA. So that's a constraint.

Similarly, tomato paste must be made with at least 10% grade A tomatoes. So x_PA >= 0.1*(x_PA + x_PB). So that's another constraint.

Now, the total amount of A tomatoes used in both products can't exceed 5000 pounds. So x_WA + x_PA <=5000. Same for B tomatoes: x_WB + x_PB <=10,000.

And of course, all variables must be non-negative.

Now, the objective is to maximize revenue. Revenue comes from selling the two products. Each product's revenue is the price per pound multiplied by the amount produced.

Wait, the prices: whole tomatoes sell for $0.08 per pound, and paste for $0.05 per pound. So for each product, the revenue is (quantity) * (price).

But wait, how do we find the quantity of each product? For whole tomatoes, the quantity is x_WA + x_WB. Because that's the total weight of whole tomatoes made. Similarly, for paste, it's x_PA + x_PB.

So the revenue would be 0.08*(x_WA + x_WB) + 0.05*(x_PA + x_PB). Because each whole tomato pound brings in $0.08, and each paste pound brings in $0.05.

Looking at the answer options, I need to find which one matches this.

Option G says the revenue is $.08 (X_WA + X_WB) + $.05 (X_PA + X_PB). That fits exactly what I was thinking.

Let me check the other options to make sure. Option A has the prices swapped: 0.10 and 0.05, which doesn't match. Option B also swaps them. Option E is breaking down into individual grades, which isn't necessary because the price depends on the product, not the grade. So E is wrong. Option G seems correct.

To formulate a linear program for the tomato cannery, we define the variables as follows:

- \( x_{WA} \): Pounds of grade A tomatoes used in whole tomatoes.
- \( x_{WB} \): Pounds of grade B tomatoes used in whole tomatoes.
- \( x_{PA} \): Pounds of grade A tomatoes used in tomato paste.
- \( x_{PB} \): Pounds of grade B tomatoes used in tomato paste.

### Objective Function:
The goal is to maximize revenue. Revenue is calculated as the sum of the revenue from whole tomatoes and tomato paste. Whole tomatoes sell for $0.08 per pound, and tomato paste sells for $0.05 per pound. The total revenue is:

\[
\text{Revenue} = 0.08 (x_{WA} + x_{WB}) + 0.05 (x_{PA} + x_{PB})
\]

### Constraints:
1. **Grade Requirements**:
   - Whole tomatoes must be at least 80% grade A: 
     \[
     x_{WA} \geq 0.8 (x_{WA} + x_{WB})
     \]
   - Tomato paste must be at least 10% grade A:
     \[
     x_{PA} \geq 0.1 (x_{PA} + x_{PB})
     \]

2. **Resource Limits**:
   - Total grade A tomatoes used cannot exceed 5,000 pounds:
     \[
     x_{WA} + x_{PA} \leq 5000
     \]
   - Total grade B tomatoes used cannot exceed 10,000 pounds:
     \[
     x_{WB} + x_{PB} \leq 10000
     \]

3. **Non-Negativity**:
   - All variables must be non-negative:
     \[
     x_{WA}, x_{WB}, x_{PA}, x_{PB} \geq 0
     \]

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It swaps the prices for whole tomatoes and tomato paste.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. It also swaps the prices for whole tomatoes and tomato paste.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. It uses incorrect prices ($0.10 and $0.08) that do not match the problem statement.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. It misrepresents the revenue calculation by swapping the products and prices.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. It breaks down revenue by tomato grade, which is unnecessary since the price depends on the product, not the grade.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. It uses incorrect prices ($0.07 and $0.04) that do not match the problem statement.
- **Option G**: Correct. It matches the revenue formula derived above:
  \[
  \text{Revenue} = 0.08 (x_{WA} + x_{WB}) + 0.05 (x_{PA} + x_{PB})
  \]
- **Option H**: Incorrect. It omits tomato paste revenue and misrepresents the revenue calculation.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. It incorrectly subtracts variables instead of summing them for revenue.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. It uses incorrect prices ($0.09 and $0.06) that do not match the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **G**.
