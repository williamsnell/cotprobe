Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand everything.

So, there's a farmer who conveyed 100 acres to a landscaper. The deed had three covenants: seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances. Then, the landscaper sold the property to a buyer using a warranty deed. But later, the buyer gets evicted by a woman who has a paramount title. Now, the buyer is suing the farmer for breach of the covenants in the deed. The question is about who should win the judgment.

Hmm, I remember that when a property is sold, the deed usually includes certain covenants. There are present covenants and future covenants. Present covenants are like guarantees that are in effect at the time of the conveyance, and future covenants are promises about what will happen in the future.

The covenants mentioned here are seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances. Let me think about each of these. The covenant of seisin is a present covenant that the grantor (farmer) actually owns the property. The right to convey is also a present covenant, ensuring the grantor has the legal right to transfer the property. The covenant against encumbrances is another present covenant, meaning the property isn't burdened by any liens or encumbrances except as stated.

Wait, but when the farmer sold to the landscaper, those covenants were made. Then the landscaper sold to the buyer with a warranty deed. Now, the buyer is suing the farmer because they were evicted due to a paramount title.

I think the key here is whether the buyer can sue the farmer for breach of the covenants. Generally, when a seller gives a warranty deed, they make certain covenants that can be enforced by the buyer. But wait, in this case, the farmer sold to the landscaper, not directly to the buyer. So does the buyer have privity of contract with the farmer? I don't think so.

Covenants in a deed typically run with the land, but only if they touch and concern the land and there's privity. Wait, but there are two types of privity: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal privity exists between the original parties (farmer and landscaper), and vertical provenity is about whether the covenant can be passed down to successors.

I think that present covenants, like seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances, can be enforced by remote grantees because they are considered to run with the land. That's because they are present covenants, so the breach occurs at the time of the conveyance. Future covenants, like warranty, might require privity, but I'm not sure.

Wait, so when the farmer conveyed to the landscaper, and then the landscaper conveyed to the buyer, the buyer is a remote grantee. But the covenants from the farmer's deed to the landscaper might still apply. Because present covenants run with the land, so the buyer can sue the farmer if those covenants were breached.

In this problem, the buyer was evicted because of a paramount title. So, the farmer's covenant of seisin (that he actually owned the land) would be breached if someone else has a better title. Also, the covenant against encumbrances might come into play if there was an encumbrance like an easement or lien that caused the eviction, but here it's about ownership—so probably seisin.

Wait, no, the covenant against encumbrances is about liens or other interests, not about ownership. So, if the farmer didn't actually own the land (because someone else had a paramount title), that would breach the covenant of seisin, not the encumbrances.

So, looking at the options, the buyer is suing the farmer. The options are about who wins. Let's look through the options:

A: Buyer, but only for seisin and right to convey. Wait, does the right to convey covenant matter here? The farmer did convey, but the problem is that the title wasn't good. The right to convey is about having the legal authority to transfer the property. If the farmer didn't own it, perhaps he didn't have the right to convey, so that covenant would also be breached.

So, the farmer breached both seisin and right to convey. The covenant against encumbrances might not be breached here because the issue is a paramount title, which is more about ownership than an encumbrance.

So, if the farmer is sued, the buyer can recover for breach of seisin and right to convey.

Looking at option B: the buyer because seisin and right to convey were breached. That seems correct.

Option H says covenants are personal and don't run with the land. But no, I think present covenants do run with the land, so the buyer can sue.

Option E says the farmer isn't liable because the buyer didn't buy directly. But since present covenants run, that shouldn't matter.

So the judgment should be for the buyer because the farmer breached the covenants of seisin and right to convey. So the answer is B.

Wait, but let me think again. The farmer's deed to the landscaper included those covenants. The landscaper then conveys with a warranty deed. But the buyer's issue is with the farmer's deed. So the buyer would be a third-party beneficiary of the covenants made by the farmer to the landscaper.

In general, when a deed's covenants are made, subsequent grantees can enforce the present covenants against the original grantor because they run with the land. So the buyer can sue the farmer.

So yes, the answer is B.

The question revolves around a farmer who conveyed 100 acres to a landscaper with a deed containing three covenants: (1) seisin, (2) right to convey, and (3) against encumbrances. The landscaper later sold the property to a buyer via a warranty deed, but the buyer was evicted due to a paramount title held by a woman. The buyer now sues the farmer for breach of the covenants in the original deed. The issue is whether the buyer can enforce these covenants against the farmer, even though the buyer did not purchase directly from the farmer.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Nature of the Covenants**:
   - The covenant of **seisin** guarantees that the grantor (farmer) owns the property at the time of conveyance.
   - The covenant of **right to convey** ensures the grantor has the legal authority to transfer the property.
   - The covenant **against encumbrances** guarantees that the property is free from liens or other burdens.

   These are all **present covenants**, which are breached, if at all, at the time of the conveyance. Present covenants are enforceable by remote grantees (like the buyer) because they "run with the land."

2. **Breach of Covenants**:
   - The buyer was evicted due to a paramount title, which means the farmer did not actually own the property at the time of the conveyance to the landscaper. This constitutes a breach of the **covenant of seisin**.
   - Since the farmer lacked ownership, they also lacked the legal authority to convey the property, breaching the **covenant of right to convey**.
   - The **covenant against encumbrances** is not implicated here because the issue is one of ownership (paramount title), not an encumbrance like a lien or easement.

3. **Privity and Enforcement**:
   - Although the buyer did not purchase directly from the farmer, present covenants run with the land and can be enforced by subsequent grantees. The farmer's covenants in the deed to the landscaper benefit the buyer as a remote grantee.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The buyer can recover for both seisin and right to convey, as both covenants were breached.
   - **Option B**: Correct. The farmer breached the covenants of seisin and right to convey, and the buyer can enforce these covenants as a remote grantee.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The buyer’s failure to conduct a title search does not absolve the farmer of liability for breaching the covenants.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The covenant against encumbrances was not breached because the issue is one of ownership, not an encumbrance.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The lack of direct privity between the buyer and the farmer does not prevent the buyer from enforcing the covenants, as present covenants run with the land.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. Privity of estate exists because the buyer holds the same estate that was originally conveyed by the farmer.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The eviction was directly related to the farmer’s breach of the covenant of seisin.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. Present covenants are not personal; they run with the land and can be enforced by remote grantees.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. While the warranty deed from the landscaper to the buyer guarantees clear title, the buyer is suing the farmer for breaching the covenants in the original deed, not the landscaper.

### Conclusion:
The judgment should be for the buyer because the farmer breached the covenants of seisin and right to convey, which are enforceable by the buyer as a remote grantee.
