Question:

In garden peas, the allele for tall plants (D) is completely dominant to the allele for dwarf plants (d) and the allele for violet flower color (W) is completely dominant to the allele for white flower color (w). In a cross between a tall violet plant, with the genotype DDWw, and a dwarf white plant, what phenotypic ratio of the progeny would be expected from this cross?

Options:

A: All dwarf white
B: 1 tall violet: 2 tall white: 1 dwarf white
C: 1 tall violet: 1 dwarf violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf white
D: All dwarf violet
E: 1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white
F: All tall violet
G: 1 tall violet: 1 dwarf violet
H: 2 tall violet: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white
I: 1 tall violet: 1 dwarf white
J: 1 tall violet: 1 tall white

Okay, so I have this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. It's about garden peas, and the question involves a cross between two plants. The parents are a tall violet plant with the genotype DDWw and a dwarf white plant. I need to find the phenotypic ratio of their offspring.

Hmm, I remember that in peas, traits are determined by different genes, and each gene has two alleles. The problem states that for height, the allele D is dominant to d. So, tall plants have at least one D allele, while dwarf plants are homozygous recessive (dd). For flower color, W is dominant to w. So, violet is dominant, and white is recessive.

The cross is between DDWw and a dwarf white. Let me write down the genotypes. The first parent is DDWw. Wait, that's two D's, so for the height gene, they're DD, which is homozygous dominant. For the flower color, Ww, which is heterozygous.

The other parent is a dwarf white. Dwarf means it's dd for the height gene, and white is ww for the flower color. So the dwarf white plant's genotype is ddww.

Wait, no. Because each gene is separate. So the flower color is a different gene, right? So the dwarf white plant must have genotype dd (for height) and ww (for flower color). So the full genotype is ddww, but since each gene is independent, we can treat them separately.

So the cross is between DDWw and ddww. I need to look at each gene separately and then combine the results.

Let's break it down into the two traits: height and flower color.

First, height: Parent 1 is DD (homozygous dominant) and Parent 2 is dd (homozygous recessive). So the cross for the D gene is DD × dd.

When DD (which can only produce gametes with D) is crossed with dd (which can only produce d gametes), all the offspring will get a D from one parent and d from the other. So the genotype of all offspring for height is Dd. Since D is dominant, all the plants will be tall. So 100% tall, no dwarfs.

Wait, wait! No, wait. Wait, the first parent is DD, so all their gametes will have D. The other parent is dd, so all gametes have d. So every child will get D from the first and d from the second, making Dd. So yes, all are Dd, and thus all are tall.

So for the height, all offspring are tall. No variation there.

Now, the flower color: the parents are Ww and ww. Parent 1 is Ww (heterozygous), so their gametes can be W or w. Parent 2 is ww (homozygous recessive), so gametes can only be w.

So the cross is Ww × ww. Let's think about the possible gametes. Ww can produce 50% W and 50% w. The ww can only produce w.

So the possible offspring for the flower gene will be:

50% W (from Ww) + w (from ww) → Ww
50% w (from Ww) + w → ww

So the phenotypic ratio for the flower color is 50% Ww (violet) and 50% ww (white). But wait, since W is dominant, Ww is violet and ww is white. So the flower color will be half violet and half white.

Putting it together, the height is all tall, and flower color is half violet and half white.

So the phenotypic ratio for the two traits combined must consider both. Since the two genes are independent, the overall ratio is obtained by multiplying the probabilities.

Each plant will be tall (since all are Dd), and for each, a 50% chance of violet (Ww) and 50% white (ww).

So the possible combinations are:

- Tall and violet: 50%
- Tall and white: 50%

But wait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio. So in terms of the number of each phenotype, it's 1:1. So the ratio is 1 tall violet : 1 tall white.

Wait, but that's not among all the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A: All dwarf white
B: 1 tall violet: 2 tall white: 1 dwarf white
C: 1 tall violet: 1 dwarf violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf white
D: All dwarf violet
E: 1 tall violet: 1 dwarf violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf white
F: All tall violet
G: 1 tall violet: 1 dwarf violet
H: 2 tall violet: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white
I: 1 tall violet: 1 dwarf white
J: 1 tall violet: 1 tall white

So option J is 1 tall violet:1 tall white. Which is exactly what I concluded.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because the parent for flower color is Ww and ww, so the F1 for that gene is Ww (50%) and ww (50%). So half the offspring are Ww (violet) and half are ww (white). Since all the plants are tall, the overall ratio is 50% tall violet and 50% tall white. So the ratio is 1:1 between the two.

So the correct answer should be the option that reflects this. Looking again, option J is 1 tall violet : 1 tall white. So that's the one.

I think that's correct. So the answer is J.

In garden peas, the allele for tall plants (D) is completely dominant to the allele for dwarf plants (d), and the allele for violet flower color (W) is completely dominant to the allele for white flower color (w). The cross is between a tall violet plant (DDWw) and a dwarf white plant (ddww). To determine the phenotypic ratio of the progeny, we analyze the two traits separately and then combine the results.

1. **Height Gene (D/d):**  
   - The first parent is DD (homozygous dominant), and the second parent is dd (homozygous recessive).  
   - All offspring will inherit one D allele from the first parent and one d allele from the second parent, resulting in the genotype Dd.  
   - Since D is dominant, all offspring will be tall.  

2. **Flower Color Gene (W/w):**  
   - The first parent is Ww (heterozygous), and the second parent is ww (homozygous recessive).  
   - The first parent produces two types of gametes: 50% W and 50% w. The second parent produces only w gametes.  
   - The possible offspring genotypes are:  
     - 50% Ww (violet, since W is dominant)  
     - 50% ww (white)  

3. **Combining the Results:**  
   - Since all offspring are tall (Dd) and there is a 1:1 ratio of violet (Ww) to white (ww) for flower color, the phenotypic ratio of the progeny is:  
     - 1 tall violet : 1 tall white  

Thus, the correct answer is **J: 1 tall violet : 1 tall white**.
