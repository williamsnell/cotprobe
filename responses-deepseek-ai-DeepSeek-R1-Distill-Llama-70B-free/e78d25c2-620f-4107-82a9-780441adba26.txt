Okay, so I have this physics question here about density, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is: If the volume of an object were to double, with no change in mass, its density would... and then there are several options to choose from.

Hmm. I remember that density is a fundamental concept in physics. Oh right, density is mass divided by volume. The formula is density (ρ) equals mass (m) divided by volume (V), so ρ = m/V.

So the setup is that the mass remains the same, but the volume doubles. Let's think. If the mass stays the same and the volume gets bigger, what happens to the density?

Wait, density is inversely proportional to volume when mass is constant. So if volume increases, density decreases. Because if you have the same amount of mass spread out over a larger volume, it's less dense.

Let me do a quick calculation. Let's say initially, mass m = 2 kg, volume V = 1 m³. So initial density is 2 kg/m³. Now, if the volume doubles, V becomes 2 m³. Mass is still 2 kg. So new density is 2 kg / 2 m³ = 1 kg/m³. So density halves.

Wait, so in this example, when volume doubles, density halves. So the answer would be that the density halves, which would correspond to option C.

But wait, let me look at the options again. Option C is "halve". So that makes sense.

Alternatively, let me think another way. Since density is m/V, if V becomes 2V, then density becomes m/(2V) = (1/2)(m/V). So yes, density is halved.

So the correct answer should be option C: halve.

The density of an object is given by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{m}{V}
\]

where \( \rho \) is density, \( m \) is mass, and \( V \) is volume. If the mass remains constant and the volume doubles, the new density becomes:

\[
\rho_{\text{new}} = \frac{m}{2V} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{m}{V} = \frac{1}{2} \rho
\]

This shows that the density is halved when the volume doubles. 

From the given options, the correct answer is:

C: halve.
