Okay, so I've got this statistics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about regression and the concepts of population and sample. Hmm, I remember that in statistics, the population refers to the entire group of items or individuals you're studying, while a sample is a subset of that population used for the actual study because it's often impractical to measure the whole population.

The question asks which statement is false regarding the regression population and sample. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says, "The population is the total collection of all items of interest." That sounds right. The population includes every single item or individual that the researcher is interested in. For example, if studying the average height of all adults in a country, the population would be all adults in that country.

Option B states, "The population can be infinite." Wait, I think that's true. Populations can be finite, like all the students in a school, but in cases like manufacturing defects in products made in a factory that runs continuously, the population is considered infinite because the production is ongoing and not limited to a fixed number.

Option C says, "In theory, the sample could be larger than the population." That seems a bit confusing. Wait, no, because the sample is a subset of the population. So how can the sample be larger? Unless... unless the population is small. Oh wait, no, if the population is, say, 100 items, the sample can't be 200. That doesn't make sense. Wait, but wait a second. There's something called a census, which is when the sample is the entire population. So in that case, the sample size equals the population size. But can the sample be larger? I don't think so because a sample is taken from the population. So maybe the statement is implying that in some cases, the sample could be the same size as the population, but not larger. So Option C might be false.

Option D: "A random sample is one where each individual item from the population is equally likely to be drawn." That sounds correct. A random sample means that every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, which ensures unbiased representation.

So, going back. The question is which statement is false. Let's reevaluate each option.

Option C: "In theory, the sample could be larger than the population." Wait, if the population is infinite, can the sample be larger? But even then, the sample is a subset. Wait, no. Because if the population is infinite, you can't have a sample larger than the population. Because the population is infinite, and a sample is finite, right? Wait, no, samples can be any size, but the sample is taken from the population. So if the population is finite and small, the sample can't exceed it. So the only way a sample could be larger is if the population is larger than the sample. But in theory, the sample can't be larger than the population because it's a subset. Wait, no, that's not possible. So maybe Option C is the false statement.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If the population is, say, 5 people, can a sample be 10? No, because you can't have more in the sample than exists in the population. So Option C must be false. Because in theory, a sample cannot be larger than the population. So the false statement is Option C.

The question asks which statement about the regression population and sample is false. Let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: "The population is the total collection of all items of interest." This is true, as the population refers to the entire group under study.
- **Option B**: "The population can be infinite." This is also true, as populations can be infinite in certain contexts, such as ongoing production processes.
- **Option C**: "In theory, the sample could be larger than the population." This is false because a sample, by definition, is a subset of the population. It cannot exceed the size of the population.
- **Option D**: "A random sample is one where each individual item from the population is equally likely to be drawn." This is true, as a random sample ensures equal probability of selection for all individuals in the population.

The false statement is **Option C**.
