Okay, so I've got this heat transfer problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a flat plate maintained at a constant temperature, with air flowing over it. I need to find the local heat transfer coefficient at a certain point, the average coefficient from the leading edge to that point, and then calculate the total heat transfer rate. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Alright, let's break it down. The plate is at 225°F, which converts to 107.6°C. The air temperature is 140°F, which is 60.3°C. The air is moving at 2.5 ft/s, which is 0.762 m/s. The point we're looking at is 3 feet from the leading edge, which is 0.91 meters.

I remember that for laminar flow over a flat plate, the local heat transfer coefficient is given by the Péclet number correlation. The formula I think is something like h_x = (k/(x)) * Nu_x, where Nu_x is the Nusselt number. And for a flat plate with constant temperature, the Nusselt number is 0.332 * Re_x^(0.5) * Pr^(1/3). 

Wait, Re_x is the Reynolds number at position x, which is (U_infinity * x) / nu. And Pr is the Prandtl number. Oh right, the fluid properties should be evaluated at the film temperature. The film temperature is the average of the plate and the air temperatures. So T_plate is 107.6°C, T_air is 60.3°C, so film temp is (107.6 + 60.3)/2 = 83.95°C. Let me convert that to Kelvin for calculations. 83.95 + 273.15 = 357.1 K.

I need to find the properties of air at this temperature. I think at around 350 K, the properties are roughly: kinematic viscosity nu is about 2.06e-5 m²/s, thermal conductivity k is about 0.0298 W/m·K, and Prandtl number Pr is approximately 0.700.

Wait, let me double-check. Air at 350 K: nu is about 2.06e-5 m²/s, k is 0.0298 W/m·K, and Pr is 0.7. Okay, that's correct.

Now, calculate Re_x. The air velocity U is 0.762 m/s, and x is 0.91 meters. So Re_x = (0.762 * 0.91) / (2.06e-5). Let me compute that. 0.762 * 0.91 = approx 0.693. Divide by 2.06e-5: 0.693 / 2.06e-5 ≈ 33661. So Re_x is about 33,661. Oh wait, that's into the laminar range because Re is less than 500,000, so the assumption holds.

Then, Nu_x is 0.332 * (Re_x)^(0.5) * (Pr)^(1/3). Let's compute this. Re_x^0.5 is sqrt(33661) ≈ 183.5. Pr^(1/3) is (0.7)^(1/3) ≈ 0.887.

So Nu_x = 0.332 * 183.5 * 0.887. Let me compute that: 0.332 * 183.5 ≈ 60.89, then 60.89 * 0.887 ≈ 54.06. So Nu_x is approximately 54.06.

Then, h_x = (k / x) * Nu_x. k is 0.0298 W/m·K, x is 0.91 m. So 0.0298 / 0.91 ≈ 0.03275. Multiply by Nu_x: 0.03275 *54.06 ≈ 1.77 W/m²·K.

Wait, that's the local heat transfer coefficient, h_x. So about 1.77 W/m²·K.

Now, the average heat transfer coefficient from x=0 to x=3 ft (0.91 m). For laminar flow, the average Nusselt number is 2 times the local Nusselt number at x. Because the average over the length is twice the value at the end. So average Nu is 2 * 54.06 ≈ 108.12.

Then h_avg = (k / x) * Nu_avg. So 0.0298 / 0.91 ≈ 0.03275. Multiply by 108.12: 0.03275 * 108.12 ≈ 3.54 W/m²·K.

So h_x is around 1.77, h_avg around 3.54.

Now, the total heat transfer rate Q per foot (0.3 m) width. The formula for Q is the average h multiplied by the area times the temperature difference. The area is length (0.91 m) times width (0.3 m). So area A = 0.91 * 0.3 = 0.273 m².

The temperature difference is T_plate - T_air. 107.6°C - 60.3°C = 47.3°C = 47.3 K.

So Q = h_avg * A * ΔT. h_avg is 3.54 W/m²·K. So 3.54 * 0.273 * 47.3.

Compute that step by step: 3.54 * 0.273 ≈ 0.966. Then 0.966 *47.3 ≈ 45.7 W.

Putting it all together: h_x ≈ 1.77, h_avg ≈3.54, Q≈45.7 W.

Looking at the options, option I says h_x=1.77, h=3.54, Q=45.7 W. So that must be the correct choice.

To solve the problem, we calculate the local heat transfer coefficient \( h_x \), the average heat transfer coefficient \( h \), and the total heat transfer rate \( Q \) for the given conditions. The plate is maintained at 225°F (107.6°C), and air at 140°F (60.3°C) flows over it at 2.5 ft/s (0.762 m/s). The length of the plate is 3 ft (0.91 m), and the width is 1 ft (0.3 m).

### Step 1: Properties of Air
The film temperature is calculated as the average of the plate and air temperatures:
\[
T_{\text{film}} = \frac{T_{\text{plate}} + T_{\infty}}{2} = \frac{107.6 + 60.3}{2} = 83.95^\circ \text{C} = 357.1 \, \text{K}.
\]
At \( T_{\text{film}} \approx 357.1 \, \text{K} \), the properties of air are:
- Thermal conductivity: \( k = 0.0298 \, \text{W/m·K} \),
- Kinematic viscosity: \( \nu = 2.06 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s} \),
- Prandtl number: \( \text{Pr} = 0.7 \).

### Step 2: Reynolds Number
The Reynolds number at \( x = 0.91 \, \text{m} \) is:
\[
\text{Re}_x = \frac{U_\infty x}{\nu} = \frac{0.762 \times 0.91}{2.06 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 33,661.
\]
Since \( \text{Re}_x < 500,000 \), the flow is laminar.

### Step 3: Local Heat Transfer Coefficient (\( h_x \))
For laminar flow over a flat plate with constant temperature, the Nusselt number is:
\[
\text{Nu}_x = 0.332 \, \text{Re}_x^{0.5} \, \text{Pr}^{1/3}.
\]
Substituting values:
\[
\text{Nu}_x = 0.332 \times (33,661)^{0.5} \times (0.7)^{1/3}.
\]
First, calculate \( \text{Re}_x^{0.5} = \sqrt{33,661} \approx 183.5 \), and \( \text{Pr}^{1/3} = (0.7)^{1/3} \approx 0.887 \). Then:
\[
\text{Nu}_x = 0.332 \times 183.5 \times 0.887 \approx 54.06.
\]
The local heat transfer coefficient is:
\[
h_x = \frac{k}{x} \, \text{Nu}_x = \frac{0.0298}{0.91} \times 54.06 \approx 1.77 \, \text{W/m}^2\text{-K}.
\]

### Step 4: Average Heat Transfer Coefficient (\( h \))
For laminar flow, the average Nusselt number over the plate is:
\[
\overline{\text{Nu}} = 2 \, \text{Nu}_x = 2 \times 54.06 \approx 108.12.
\]
The average heat transfer coefficient is:
\[
h = \frac{k}{x} \, \overline{\text{Nu}} = \frac{0.0298}{0.91} \times 108.12 \approx 3.54 \, \text{W/m}^2\text{-K}.
\]

### Step 5: Total Heat Transfer Rate (\( Q \))
The heat transfer rate is given by:
\[
Q = h \, A \, \Delta T,
\]
where \( A = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 0.91 \times 0.3 = 0.273 \, \text{m}^2 \), and \( \Delta T = T_{\text{plate}} - T_\infty = 107.6 - 60.3 = 47.3 \, \text{K} \). Substituting:
\[
Q = 3.54 \times 0.273 \times 47.3 \approx 45.7 \, \text{W}.
\]

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- \( h_x = 1.77 \, \text{W/m}^2\text{-K} \),
- \( h = 3.54 \, \text{W/m}^2\text{-K} \),
- \( Q = 45.7 \, \text{W} \).

The correct option is **I**.
