Question:

A biologist deals with things on a microscopic level. To A biologist deals with things on a microscopic level. To describe cellular dimensions and the amount of materials present at the cellular level, units of an appropriately small size are needed. What are these units of measurements?

Options:

A: The units of length include the micron and the \AAngstrom. Weights are expressed in milligrams, micrograms, and nanograms. The unit of molecular weight is the dalton.
B: The units include meter, kilogram, and second.
C: The units include the liter for volume, the hectare for area, and the joule for energy.
D: The units include mile, ton, and hour.
E: The units include foot, pound, and minute.
F: The units of length include centimeter and decimeter. Weights are expressed in grams and decigrams.
G: The units of length include the millimeter and the picometer. Weights are expressed in picograms and centigrams.
H: The units of measurement are the kilometer for length and the metric ton for weight.
I: The units of length include the inch and the yard. Weights are expressed in ounces and stones.
J: The units of length are measured in leagues and fathoms. Weights are expressed in carats and pecks.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about biology units. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that a biologist deals with microscopic things, so they need units that are really small. I remember that in biology, especially when talking about cells and molecules, the units can't be the same as the ones we use everyday because cells are super tiny.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which one includes the right small units for length, weight, and molecular weight.

Option A says the units of length include the micron and the Ångstrom. I recall that a micron is one-millionth of a meter, which is pretty small, right? And an Ångstrom is even smaller, like 0.1 nanometers, used for atomic scales. So that makes sense for microscopic biology.

Weights in A are milligrams, micrograms, and nanograms. I remember that milligrams are 1e-3 grams, micro is 1e-6, nano 1e-9. Those are definitely small enough for cellular levels.

Molecular weight being the dalton also fits because that's the unit used for molecules, like proteins or DNA. So A seems like a strong candidate.

Let me check the other options to be sure. Option B uses meter, kilogram, second. Those are the standard SI units, but they're way too big for cellular biology. So B doesn't fit.

Option C has liter (volume), hectare (area), joule (energy). Those are larger units, not suitable for microscopic stuff. So C isn't right.

Option D is mile, ton, hour. Even bigger units, definitely not for tiny scales.

Option E is foot, pound, minute. Also larger and not metric, so probably not the answer.

Option F uses centimeter and decimeter for length. Centimeter is 1e-2 meters, which is bigger than a millimeter, and decimeter is even larger. The weights are grams and decigrams—those are bigger than what a biologist would use at the cellular level. So F doesn't make sense.

Option G has millimeter and picometer. Millimeter is 1e-3 meters, which is larger than a micron. Wait, no, a millimeter is bigger than a micron. Wait, no, a micron is a micrometer, which is 1e-6 meters, so smaller than a millimeter. So if G says millimeter, that's larger than needed. Picometers are even smaller, but the combination might not be the best fit. Weights are picograms and centigrams. Picograms are 1e-12 grams, which is tiny, but centigrams are 1e-2 grams, which is bigger. I'm not sure if that's the best fit. Also, the question mentions the unit for molecular weight, which G doesn't address. So G might not be the best choice.

Option H uses kilometers and metric tons, which are way too big. So H is out.

Option I has inches, yards, ounces, stones. These are imperial units and not small enough. So I isn't right.

Option J uses leagues and fathoms, which are even larger units, and carats and pecks. Definitely not for microscopic measurements. So J is out.

So the only option that fits all the criteria—small units for length (micron and Ångstrom), small weight units (milli, micro, nano grams), and dalton for molecular weight—is option A.

The correct answer is option A because it provides units of measurement that are appropriately small for describing cellular dimensions and materials at the microscopic level. The micron and Ångstrom are suitable for length, milligrams, micrograms, and nanograms for weight, and the dalton for molecular weight. Other options either use units that are too large or inappropriate for biological measurements.

Answer: A
