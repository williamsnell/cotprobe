Question:

Carol Collector was a serious antique car buyer, and was always searching for Thunderbirds in good shape. She saw a newspaper ad offering a 1964 Thunderbird sports coupe for $25,000, The ad also gave a website address "to view a picture of the car," which Carol visited, and which showed a T-Bird with a perfect body and interior. Carol paid the $25,000 and signed a sales contract which specified that the Thunderbird was "used and sold as is." When Carol went to pick up the car, she learned it was a 1968 model, which was not at all rare and worth much less than the advertised 1964 model. If Carol brings suit against the seller, the likely outcome is for

Options:

A: Carol, because the internet picture was of a car that had never been driven, not the actual used car she was to buy.
B: Carol, because the seller was not negligent in providing a picture of the car.
C: Carol, because the "as is" disclosure was not totally effective.
D: The seller, unless they can prove Carol had knowledge that the car was a 1968 model.
E: The seller, because the car was misrepresented in the advertisement.
F: The seller, because the buyer was aware the Thunderbird was sold "as is."
G: Carol, unless the seller can prove the 1968 model was of equal value to the 1964 model.
H: The seller, unless they were negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold.
I: The seller, if Carol can prove she relied on the picture when making her purchase.
J: Carol, because the seller provided a picture of the car, regardless of its condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about Carol Collector and the Thunderbird car she bought. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: Carol saw an ad for a 1964 Thunderbird sports coupe priced at $25,000. The ad had a website with a picture showing a perfect body and interior. She paid and signed a contract stating the car was "used and sold as is." When she picked it up, it was a 1968 model, which is less rare and valuable. Now she's suing the seller. The question is about who will likely win.

I remember that when buying items, especially used ones, the "as is" clause usually means the buyer takes the item in its current condition, and the seller isn't liable for defects unless they're hidden or unless there's some kind of misrepresentation.

So the key here is whether the seller misrepresented the car. The ad specifically said it was a 1964 model, which is a key detail because the value can vary a lot between model years. So if the seller advertised a 1964 but delivered a 1968, that's a misrepresentation of a material fact. 

The "as is" clause might not protect the seller if they lied about the car's model year. Because that's a fundamental aspect of the car, not just its condition. So even though the contract says "as is," the seller can't use that to avoid liability for false advertising.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the seller loses because the car was misrepresented in the ad. That makes sense because the ad was false about the model year, which is a material fact.

Option C suggests the "as is" disclosure wasn't effective. I'm not sure if that's the case because "as is" usually covers the condition, not the identity of the item. So the seller can't hide behind "as is" if they sold the wrong model.

Other options like F say the seller wins because it's "as is," but that doesn't account for the misrepresentation. So F is probably wrong.

Option I says the seller wins if Carol relied on the picture. Wait, but the picture was of a 1964 model, which she thought she was buying. So if the picture was part of the ad, and it showed a '64, then that's part of the misrepresentation. So I don't think I is correct.

Option G says Carol wins unless the seller proves equal value. But the question states the 1968 is worth much less, so that condition isn't met. So G might not apply because the seller can't prove equal value.

So putting it all together, the main issue is the false advertising about the model year. The "as is" clause doesn't cover that. Therefore, Carol should win because of the misrepresentation.

The key issue in this case is whether the seller misrepresented the car's model year in the advertisement. The ad explicitly stated it was a 1964 Thunderbird, which is a material fact affecting the car's value. The "as is" clause typically covers the car's condition but not misrepresentation of its identity or fundamental characteristics. Since the seller delivered a 1968 model instead of the advertised 1964, this constitutes misrepresentation. Therefore, the seller is likely liable, and Carol will prevail.

E: The seller, because the car was misrepresented in the advertisement.
