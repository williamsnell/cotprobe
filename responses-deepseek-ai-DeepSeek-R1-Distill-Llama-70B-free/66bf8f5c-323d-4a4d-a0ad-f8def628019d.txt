Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The equation is x squared times y squared minus 3y plus 2x cubed equals zero. So it's written as x²y² - 3y + 2x³ = 0. And I'm supposed to find the derivative f'(x) at the points (1,1) and (1,2), and then return the results in a list.

Wait, the question says to return the derivative near those points, but I think that just means evaluating f' at those points, since f is defined as y = f(x). So I need to find f'(1) for each of the y values when x is 1.

First, I remember that when you have an equation like this and y is a function of x, you need to use implicit differentiation to find the derivative dy/dx, which is f'(x). So let's start by differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to x.

The equation is x²y² - 3y + 2x³ = 0. Let's break it down term by term.

1. The first term is x²y². I'll need to use the product rule here because it's x squared times y squared. The product rule says that the derivative of u*v is u'v + uv'. So u is x² and v is y². 

The derivative of x² is 2x. So the first part is 2x * y². Then, the derivative of y² with respect to x is 2y times dy/dx. So putting it together, the derivative of the first term is 2x y² + x² * 2y * dy/dx.

Wait, no, I think I messed that up. Let me correct. The product rule for x² * y² would be derivative of x² times y² plus x² times derivative of y². So:

d/dx (x²y²) = (2x)(y²) + (x²)(2y dy/dx). 

Yes, that's right. So that's 2x y² + 2x² y y'.

2. The second term is -3y. The derivative of this with respect to x is -3 dy/dx, because the derivative of y with respect to x is dy/dx.

3. The third term is 2x³. The derivative of this is 6x².

Putting it all together, the derivative of the entire equation is:

2x y² + 2x² y y' - 3 y' + 6x² = 0.

Now I need to solve for y'. Let's collect the terms with y':

So, 2x² y y' - 3 y' = - (2x y² + 6x²).

Factor out y' from the left side:

y' (2x² y - 3) = - (2x y² + 6x²).

Then, solving for y':

y' = [ - (2x y² + 6x²) ] / (2x² y - 3).

Alternatively, y' = (-2x y² - 6x²) / (2x² y - 3).

Okay, so that's the general expression for f'(x) = y'.

Now, I need to evaluate this at the points (1,1) and (1,2). So x is 1 in both cases, but y is 1 and 2 respectively.

Let's compute f'(1) when y=1 first.

Plugging x=1 and y=1 into the expression:

Numerator: -2*(1)*(1)^2 - 6*(1)^2 = -2*1 -6*1 = -2 -6 = -8.

Denominator: 2*(1)^2*(1) -3 = 2*1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1.

So y' = (-8)/(-1) = 8.

Wait, but wait, when I plug into the expression, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, the numerator is (-2x y² -6x²). So at x=1, y=1: (-2*1*(1)^2) = -2*1 = -2. Then -6*(1)^2 is -6. So total numerator is -2 -6 = -8.

Denominator: 2*(1)^2*(1) -3 = 2*1 -3 = -1.

So y' = (-8)/(-1) = 8. So f'(1) at (1,1) is 8.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to check if I did that correctly. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me recheck:

The derivative when x=1, y=1:

Numerator: -2*(1)*(1)^2 is -2, and -6*(1)^2 is -6. So total is -8.

Denominator: 2*(1)^2*(1) is 2*1=2, minus 3 is -1.

So yes, y' is (-8)/(-1) = 8. So the first value is 8.

Now, for the point (1,2), where x=1 and y=2.

Compute numerator and denominator again.

Numerator: -2x y² -6x².

x=1, y=2:

-2*1*(2)^2 = -2*4 = -8.

-6*(1)^2 = -6*1 = -6.

So total numerator is -8 -6 = -14.

Denominator: 2x² y -3.

2*(1)^2*2 = 2*1*2 =4.

4 -3=1.

So denominator is 1.

So y' = (-14)/1 = -14.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 2x² y is 2*(1)^2 *2 = 2*1*2=4. 4-3=1. Correct.

Numerator: -2*(1)*(2)^2 = -2*4= -8. Then -6*(1)^2 is -6, so total is -8-6= -14. So yes, y' = -14.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see [8, -14]. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: [12, -18]

B: [9, -13]

C: [9, -15]

D: [8, -14]

E: [11, -17]

F: [5, -11]

G: [6, -12]

H: [10, -16]

I: [7, -13]

J: [7, -12]

So option D is [8, -14], which matches my calculations. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistake.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-express the equation correctly.

Wait, the derivative calculation:

We had the equation after differentiation: 2x y² + 2x² y y' -3y' +6x²=0.

Then, moving the non-y' terms to the other side:

2x² y y' -3 y' = - (2x y² +6x²)

Factor y' out:

y'(2x² y -3) = -2x y² -6x²

So y' = [ -2x y² -6x² ] / [2x² y -3]

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator sign. Let me check:

Wait, the equation after differentiation is:

2x y² + 2x² y y' -3y' +6x² =0.

Let me rearrange terms:

2x² y y' -3 y' = -2x y² -6x².

Yes, that's correct.

So denominator is 2x² y -3.

Now, for (1,1), denominator is 2*(1)^2*1 -3=2-3=-1.

Numerator is -2*(1)*(1)^2 -6*(1)^2 = -2 -6 =-8.

So y' is (-8)/(-1) =8.

At (1,2):

Denominator is 2*(1)^2*(2) -3=4-3=1.

Numerator is -2*1*(2)^2 -6*1^2= -8 -6= -14.

So y'=-14/1=-14.

So the results are [8, -14], which is option D.

Wait, but let me check: Are there any other options with 8 and -14? Looking at the options, yes, option D is [8, -14].

So the correct answer should be option D.

To solve the problem, we start with the equation \( x^2 y^2 - 3y + 2x^3 = 0 \), where \( y = f(x) \). We use implicit differentiation to find \( f'(x) \), the derivative of \( y \) with respect to \( x \).

### Step 1: Differentiate the equation
Differentiating each term with respect to \( x \):
1. \( \frac{d}{dx}(x^2 y^2) = 2x y^2 + 2x^2 y \frac{dy}{dx} \) (using the product rule).
2. \( \frac{d}{dx}(-3y) = -3 \frac{dy}{dx} \).
3. \( \frac{d}{dx}(2x^3) = 6x^2 \).

Putting it all together:
\[
2x y^2 + 2x^2 y \frac{dy}{dx} - 3 \frac{dy}{dx} + 6x^2 = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( \frac{dy}{dx} \)
Collect the terms containing \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) on one side:
\[
2x^2 y \frac{dy}{dx} - 3 \frac{dy}{dx} = -2x y^2 - 6x^2.
\]

Factor out \( \frac{dy}{dx} \):
\[
\frac{dy}{dx}(2x^2 y - 3) = -2x y^2 - 6x^2.
\]

Finally, solve for \( \frac{dy}{dx} \):
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-2x y^2 - 6x^2}{2x^2 y - 3}.
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate \( f'(1) \) at the points \( (1,1) \) and \( (1,2) \)
1. **At \( (1,1) \):**
   - Numerator: \( -2(1)(1)^2 - 6(1)^2 = -2 - 6 = -8 \).
   - Denominator: \( 2(1)^2(1) - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1 \).
   - \( f'(1) = \frac{-8}{-1} = 8 \).

2. **At \( (1,2) \):**
   - Numerator: \( -2(1)(2)^2 - 6(1)^2 = -8 - 6 = -14 \).
   - Denominator: \( 2(1)^2(2) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1 \).
   - \( f'(1) = \frac{-14}{1} = -14 \).

### Final Answer
The derivatives at the points \( (1,1) \) and \( (1,2) \) are \( [8, -14] \), which corresponds to option **D**.
