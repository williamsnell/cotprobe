Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a macroscopic object and finding its quantum number n. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The object has a mass of 1.0 gram, which is 0.001 kg. It's moving at a speed of 1.0 cm per second, so that's 0.01 m/s. The box it's in is one-dimensional and has a length of 1.0 cm, which is 0.01 meters.

I remember that for particles in a 1D box, the energy levels are quantized and given by the equation E_n = (n² h²) / (8 m L²), where h is Planck's constant, m is the mass, L is the length of the box, and n is the quantum number. But wait, wait. Alternatively, another formula might be more useful here, perhaps involving momentum.

Oh right, the momentum p of the particle is related to the quantum number. The formula for the allowed momentum in a box is p = n h / (2 L), but wait, let me think. Actually, the quantized momentum is given by p = n π ħ / L. But ħ is h/(2π), so substituting that in, p would be n h / (2 L). Wait, maybe I should derive it.

The wavefunction for a particle in a box has nodes at the ends, so the wavelength λ is related to the length L as L = n λ/2. Because the standing wave must fit an integer number of half-wavelengths in the box. So the wavelength λ = 2L/n.

Then momentum p is related to wavelength by p = h / λ. Substituting, p = h / (2L/n) ) = (n h) / (2 L). So p = n h/(2 L).

Wait, but p is also equal to m v, right? Because p = m v. So I can set m v equal to n h/(2 L) and solve for n.

Let me write that equation:

m v = n h / (2 L)

We need to solve for n, so rearranging:

n = (2 L m v) / h

Okay, so I have all the variables except h. Let me plug in the numbers.

First, let's list the known values:

m = 1.0 g = 0.001 kg
v = 1.0 cm/s = 0.01 m/s
L = 1.0 cm = 0.01 m
h = Planck's constant = 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s

Now compute each part step by step.

Calculate the numerator: 2 * L * m * v

2 * 0.01 m * 0.001 kg * 0.01 m/s

Let me compute that:

2 * 0.01 = 0.02
0.02 * 0.001 = 0.00002
0.00002 * 0.01 = 2e-7 kg·m²/s

Wait, wait, let me compute it numerically.

2 * 0.01 = 0.02
0.02 * 0.001 = 0.00002
0.00002 * 0.01 = 0.0000002 kg·m²/s

Wait, that's 2e-7 kg·m²/s.

Denominator is h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

So n = (2e-7) / (6.626e-34) 

Wait, wait, let me compute that.

n = (2e-7) / (6.626e-34) = (2 / 6.626) * 1e27.

2 divided by 6.626 is approximately 0.3019.

So 0.3019e27 = 3.019e26.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 2e-7 is 2 * 10^-7, and h is ~6.626e-34.

So 2e-7 / 6.626e-34 = (2 / 6.626) * (1e-7 / 1e-34) )

1e-7 / 1e-34 is 1e27. So 2/6.626 is approx 0.3019.

So 0.3019e27 is 3.019e26.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option J is 3e26, which is 3 x10^26.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check my calculation because 3e26 isn't one of the options. Wait, looking at the options:

The options are labeled A to J. Let's see:

Option J is 3e26, which is 3 x10^26. So that would match our calculation of approximately 3.02e26.

Wait, but the options don't have 3e26 as one of the first options. Let me check the choices again.

Wait, the options given are:

A: 8e26

B: 1e27

C:1e26

D:9e26

E:6e26

F:2e26

G:4e26

H:7e26

I:5e26

J: 3e26

Yes, so J is 3e26. So the correct answer would be J.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the formula because sometimes I might mix up the factors. Did I get the formula right?

The formula for p is n h/(2 L), right? Because earlier I thought p = n h/(2 L). So p = m v = n h/(2 L). So n = (2 L m v)/h. That should be correct.

Wait another thing, perhaps I made a mistake with the exponents.

Wait, let me compute 2e-7 divided by 6.626e-34.

So 2e-7 / 6.626e-34 = (2 / 6.626) * (1e-7 / 1e-34) ) = (0.3019) * (1e27) ) = 3.019e26.

Yes, so about 3e26, which is option J.

Wait, but wait, let me think again about the formula. Another possible approach is using the de Broglie wavelength.

De Broglie wavelength λ = h / p = h/(m v).

In a box of length L, the allowed wavelengths are λ = 2L/n, since the number of wavelengths (or half-wavelengths, depending on boundary conditions) must fit into the box.

Wait, no, for a 1D box, the standing wave has nodes at both ends, so the length L is an integer multiple of half the wavelength. So L = n (λ/2) → λ = 2L/n.

So combining with de Broglie's equation:

λ = h/(m v) = 2L/n → n = 2L m v / h.

Which matches the formula I used earlier. So I think I did it correctly.

So n is approximately 3e26, which is option J.

To determine the quantum number \( n \) for a macroscopic object of mass \( m = 1.0 \, \mathrm{g} = 0.001 \, \mathrm{kg} \), moving with speed \( v = 1.0 \, \mathrm{cm/s} = 0.01 \, \mathrm{m/s} \) in a one-dimensional box of length \( L = 1.0 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.01 \, \mathrm{m} \), we use the relationship between momentum and the quantum number.

For a particle in a 1D box, the quantized momentum is given by:

\[
p = \frac{n h}{2 L},
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \) is Planck's constant. Since momentum \( p \) is also related to mass and velocity by \( p = m v \), we equate the two expressions:

\[
m v = \frac{n h}{2 L}.
\]

Rearranging for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{2 L m v}{h}.
\]

Substituting the given values:

- \( L = 0.01 \, \mathrm{m} \),
- \( m = 0.001 \, \mathrm{kg} \),
- \( v = 0.01 \, \mathrm{m/s} \),
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \),

we calculate:

\[
n = \frac{2 (0.01) (0.001) (0.01)}{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}.
\]

First, compute the numerator:

\[
2 \times 0.01 \times 0.001 \times 0.01 = 2 \times 10^{-7} = 2 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Now divide by \( h \):

\[
n = \frac{2 \times 10^{-7}}{6.626 \times 10^{-34}} = \frac{2}{6.626} \times 10^{27}.
\]

Approximating \( \frac{2}{6.626} \approx 0.3019 \):

\[
n \approx 0.3019 \times 10^{27} = 3.019 \times 10^{26}.
\]

Thus, \( n \approx 3 \times 10^{26} \).

From the given options:

- **A: \( 8 \times 10^{26} \)**
- **B: \( 1 \times 10^{27} \)**
- **C: \( 1 \times 10^{26} \)**
- **D: \( 9 \times 10^{26} \)**
- **E: \( 6 \times 10^{26} \)**
- **F: \( 2 \times 10^{26} \)**
- **G: \( 4 \times 10^{26} \)**
- **H: \( 7 \times 10^{26} \)**
- **I: \( 5 \times 10^{26} \)**
- **J: \( 3 \times 10^{26} \)**

The closest match is **J: \( 3 \times 10^{26} \)**.
