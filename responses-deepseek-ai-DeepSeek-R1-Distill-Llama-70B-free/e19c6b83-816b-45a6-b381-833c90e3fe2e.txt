Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about sorting algorithms, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Hmm, let's see. The question is about selection sort, insertion sort, and bubble sort. I remember that each of these has different efficiencies based on the initial arrangement of the array.

The question is asking about data movements, which are swaps or reassignments of elements. So I need to think about how each algorithm handles these operations.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: If the array is already sorted in ascending order, selection sort will be more efficient than insertion sort. Wait, I thought that insertion sort is efficient for nearly sorted arrays. So if the array is already sorted, insertion sort would just run through it quickly, right? Selection sort, on the other hand, always has O(n²) time complexity. So in the best case, insertion sort would be better. So option A might be false.

Option B: The number of comparisons for selection sort depends on the initial arrangement. Selection sort works by selecting the smallest element and moving it to the front, then the next, etc. I think it always does the same number of comparisons, regardless of the array's initial state. So B might be false. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. For each position, selection sort looks for the minimum in the remaining elements. So whether the array is sorted or not, it's going to check each element each time. So the number of comparisons is actually fixed, n*(n-1)/2 comparisons. So B is incorrect because the number of comparisons doesn't depend on the initial arrangement.

Option C: The number of data movements in selection sort depends on the initial arrangement. Oh, right. Because selection sort moves elements when it swaps them into place. If the array is already sorted, each selection would only require one swap (moving the next element into place). Wait, no. Wait, selection sort swaps the current element with the smallest element found in the unsorted portion. So if the array is already sorted, the first element is the smallest, so when you look for the min in positions 0 to n-1, you find it at 0, then swap with position 0 (so no movement), then for the next, look from 1 to n-1, find the next element which is already in place, etc. So actually, in a sorted array, selection sort doesn't do any swaps beyond maybe the first element. Wait, no. Wait, in each iteration, you select the minimum and swap it into the correct position. If the array is already sorted, then in the first pass, the min is at 0, so no swap. Next pass, min is at 1, so no swap. So the number of swaps is zero? Or is it one per iteration? Wait, no, because each selection step finds the minimum, which is already in the correct spot, so no swaps are needed. So the number of swaps (data movements) is zero. But if the array is in reverse order, then each selection would require a swap, so each of the n-1 iterations would swap, leading to n-1 data movements. So the number of data movements does depend on the initial arrangement. So option C is true. But I should check the other options to be sure.

Option D: The number of comparisons for bubble sort is independent of the initial arrangement. Bubble sort works by comparing adjacent elements and swapping if needed. The maximum number of comparisons is n*(n-1)/2. But if the array is already sorted, bubble sort can detect it early and exit, right? Wait, no, standard bubble sort doesn't have a flag. If it's optimized with a flag that stops if no swaps occur, then in the best case, it does only n-1 comparisons. But if it's the basic version without the flag, then it always does the same number of comparisons. Hmm, the question doesn't specify, so I think by default, bubble sort is considered without the flag. So the number of comparisons would be fixed. So option D would be correct. But wait, in the standard bubble sort, each pass reduces the number of elements to check. Wait, no, each pass goes through the array up to n-1, n-2, etc., but the total number of comparisons in all passes would be n*(n-1)/2 regardless. So D says the number is independent, which would be correct if it's standard. So D's statement is true. But wait, I thought that if the array is sorted early, you can have fewer comparisons if you have the flag. But since the question doesn't mention a flag, perhaps D is correct.

Option E: The number of data movements in bubble sort is independent of initial arrangement. Bubble sort swaps adjacent elements. If the array is already sorted, then no swaps happen, so data movements are zero. But if the array is in reverse order, then each of the n*(n-1)/2 comparisons would result in a swap. So data movements depend on the arrangement. So E is false.

Option F: The number of comparisons for insertion sort is independent of initial arrangement. Insertion sort's comparisons can vary. In the best case (already sorted), each element is compared once, so total is O(n). In the worst case, each element is compared with all previous elements, so O(n²). So F is false.

Option G: The number of comparisons for selection sort is independent. As I thought earlier, selection sort's comparisons are always the same, n*(n-1)/2, so G is true. So option G is correct.

Option H: If the array is sorted in descending order, insertion sort is more efficient than selection sort. Insertion sort in the worst case (reverse order) has O(n²) comparisons. Selection sort also has O(n²) comparisons. But insertion sort requires more data movements in this case. Wait, but in terms of efficiency, insertion sort might be better because it can have fewer swaps. Let me think: selection sort always does O(n) swaps, while insertion sort does O(n²) swaps in the worst case. Wait, no, insertion sort's number of swaps depends on how many elements are moved. For a reverse-sorted array, insertion sort would require each element to be shifted all the way to the beginning, leading to more data movements. But in terms of comparisons, insertion sort would have O(n²) as well. But selection sort's number of comparisons is fixed, as we said. So in terms of time, if both have O(n²) comparisons, but insertion sort has more data movements (swaps), then selection sort is better, making H incorrect.

Wait, but the question is about efficiency. If both have the same number of comparisons but insertion sort has more data movements, then insertion sort is less efficient. So H says insertion sort is more efficient, which would be false.

So, let's recap:

Looking for the correct option.

Option C says data movements in selection sort depend on initial arrangement. That's correct because if the array is already sorted, selection sort does zero swaps. If it's reversed, n-1 swaps. So C is correct.

Option G says the number of comparisons for selection sort is independent of initial arrangement, which is correct because it's always n(n-1)/2.

Wait, but which one is the correct answer.

The question asks for a true statement. So which of these options is correct.

Looking at the options, the question lists the options as A through H.

Wait, the question's options are A to J, but the list provided is up to H. So I only have to consider options A to H.

Wait, looking again:

Options:

A: If the array is initially sorted in ascending order, selection sort is more efficient than insertion sort.

Wait, insertion sort is more efficient in this case. So A is wrong.

B: Number of comparisons for selection sort depends on initial arrangement. No, always same. So B wrong.

C: Data movements in selection sort depend on arrangement. Correct.

D: Comparisons for bubble sort are independent. If it's the standard bubble sort without a flag, yes. So D is correct.

G: Comparisons for selection sort are independent. Correct.

So which options are correct.

Wait, but the question is to choose which is a true statement.

So options C and G and D may be correct.

Wait, but let me re-examine.

Option C: Data movements in selection sort depend on initial arrangement. Correct, as explained.

Option G: Comparisons for selection sort are independent. Correct.

So the question is which of these is a true statement. But the options are presented as A-J, so only one is correct.

Wait, looking again at the options:

The options are:

A: ... 

B: ... 

C: Data movements in selection sort depend on initial arrangement.

D: Comparisons for bubble sort are independent.

E: Data movements in bubble sort are independent.

F: Comparisons for insertion sort are independent.

G: Comparisons for selection sort are independent.

H: ... 

So, if G is correct, then option G is the correct statement. But I also thought C is correct.

Which is correct?

Wait, the number of data movements in selection sort is indeed dependent on the initial state. For a sorted array, it's 0 swaps. For a reverse sorted, it's n-1 swaps. So C is correct.

But what about G? Does selection sort have a fixed number of comparisons? Yes, because in each of the n-1 passes, it looks through the remaining elements. So for an array of size n, the number of comparisons is (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = n(n-1)/2. So G is correct.

So both C and G are correct statements. But in the options, only one can be correct because it's a multiple-choice question.

Wait, the options are A to J, but the given options are only up to H. Let me check the question again.

The options are A through J, but the specific ones listed are A to H. So perhaps I'm missing some, but the options given in the question are up to H. So perhaps the correct answer is either C, G, or D.

Wait, but the question is which is a true statement.

Let me think about each option.

Option D: The number of comparisons for bubble sort is independent of the initial arrangement. 

Standard bubble sort without any optimizations runs in O(n²) time, making n(n-1)/2 comparisons, regardless of the initial order. So D is correct.

But if you have an optimized version with a flag that exits early, then the number of comparisons would vary. But the question doesn't specify, so we have to assume it's the standard version.

So D is correct.

Wait, but in the standard bubble sort, the number of comparisons is fixed. So D is correct.

So now, options C, D, G are candidates.

Wait, the question asks which is a true statement.

So, the correct options are:

C: Data movements in selection sort depend on initial arrangement. True.

D: Comparisons for bubble sort are independent. True.

G: Comparisons for selection sort are independent. True.

So, but which of these is among the options.

Wait, the options given are up to H, but the actual correct options would be C, D, G.

So the question is, which of these is a correct statement.

But looking at the options again, the question is which is the true statement.

So all of C, D, G are correct. But that's impossible because it's a single-choice question. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no. The options are A to J, but the provided options only go up to H. So perhaps the correct answer is among these.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think which options are correct.

Option C: number of data movements in selection sort depends on initial arrangement. True.

Option G: number of comparisons in selection sort is independent. True.

Option D: number of comparisons in bubble sort is independent. True.

But the question says which is a true statement. So all three are correct, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps bubble sort's comparisons are not independent of initial arrangement because with a flag, it can stop early. But if the bubble sort implementation doesn't have the flag, then it's fixed.

But the question doesn't specify, so perhaps the intended answer assumes that bubble sort doesn't have the flag.

So in that case, D is correct.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me recall each algorithm.

Selection sort: Always performs the same number of comparisons, n(n-1)/2. But the number of swaps (data movements) depends on the array. For a sorted array, no swaps, so data movements are minimal. For a reverse-sorted array, each selection requires a swap, so n-1 swaps. So C is correct.

So option C is correct.

Then, looking at the other options.

Option G says that the number of comparisons in selection sort is independent. Which is correct. So G is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is true, and multiple might be true, but only one is among the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C and G.

But in the options, each is a separate option.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice, so only one option is correct. This complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the answer.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: Selection better than insertion when sorted. No, insertion is better. So A is wrong.

Option B: Selection comparisons depend on arrangement. No, they are fixed. So B is wrong.

Option C: Data movements in selection depend on arrangement. Yes, correct.

Option D: Bubble comparisons are independent. Yes, correct.

Option E: Bubble data movements are independent. No, because if the array is sorted, no swaps. So E is wrong.

Option F: Insertion comparisons are independent. No, insertion's comparisons vary with arrangement. So F is wrong.

Option G: Selection comparisons are independent. Yes, correct.

Option H: Insertion more efficient than selection when array is reverse sorted. Hmm. In terms of number of operations, insertion sort would require more data movements, but same number of comparisons. So in terms of comparisons, they are same. But in terms of data movements, selection is better. So insertion may not be more efficient. So H is incorrect.

So, the correct statements are C, D, and G.

But the options are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

So I have to choose which of these is correct. The question is which statement is true.

So the correct options would be C, D, G.

But the question is a single-choice, which suggests that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question is about data movement being a swap or reassignment. So for selection sort, data movement is the number of swaps. For insertion sort, data movement is the number of shifts (each element being moved).

Wait, but the question is about which statement is true.

So, looking at the options, the correct statements are C, D, G.

But which one of them is among the options, and which is correct.

The question is, which is a true statement.

So, if I have to choose from the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, option G is correct.

Wait, the problem is that the question allows for multiple correct statements, but the options are individual.

But looking again, the options are as given, and only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Because for selection sort, the number of data movements (swaps) depends on the array. So if the array is already sorted, selection sort will perform no swaps. But in the worst case, it would have to swap each element once, leading to (n-1) swaps.

In that case, option C is correct.

But what about option G? It says the number of comparisons is independent. That's also correct.

So perhaps the correct answer includes both C and G, but since it's a single-choice, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, the question is which statement is true. So perhaps more than one is true, but the options are given as A-J, and the correct answer is among them.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the correct answer.

Wait, in the given options, the correct statements would be C and G. But which is presented as an option.

Looking at the options, both C and G are present.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C and G.

But in a multiple-choice question, it's only one correct answer. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about each option.

Option C: Data movements (swaps) in selection sort depend on initial arrangement. True.

Option G: Comparisons in selection sort are independent. True.

So both C and G are correct. But the question only allows to choose one, so perhaps I'm mistaken.

Wait, perhaps the question is only about data movement, so option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps another option is better.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But I'm unsure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H.

Wait, option H says that if the array is sorted in descending order, insertion sort is more efficient than selection sort.

In terms of time, insertion sort would require O(n²) comparisons and O(n²) swaps, while selection sort requires O(n²) comparisons and O(n) swaps. So selection sort would have fewer data movements, making it more efficient. So H is incorrect.

Hmm. Going back, the correct options are C, D, G.

But the question is, which is a true statement.

So perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, the answer is option C.

Wait, but I thought that G is also correct, but perhaps the question is only about data movement.

Wait, the question starts with "assuming that a 'data movement' is a swap or reassignment of an element, which of the following is a true statement?"

So the question is about the number of data movements.

So, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Because data movements in selection sort depend on the initial arrangement. If the array is already sorted, selection sort does no swaps. If it's reversed, it does many.

But option G is about comparisons, which are not data movements, so perhaps the question is more focused on data movements.

So the correct answer is C.

But wait, option G is about comparisons, which is a different aspect. So which is the correct statement.

The question asks which is a true statement, regardless of the aspect. So both C and G are correct statements, but the options list them as separate.

In that case, the correct answers would be both C and G, but since it's a single-choice, I might have to choose between them.

But perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, let me think again about each algorithm.

Selection sort:

- For each i from 0 to n-2:

   - Find the minimum in the array from i to n-1.

   - Swap the found minimum with the element at position i.

So the number of comparisons is always (n-1)*n/2.

But the number of swaps depends on how many times the minimum is not already in place. So if the array is sorted,
