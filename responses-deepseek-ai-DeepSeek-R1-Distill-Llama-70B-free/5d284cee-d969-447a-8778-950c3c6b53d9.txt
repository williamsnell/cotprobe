Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about T4 phages and their mutations. Hmm, let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

So the setup is that T4 phages with mutations in the rII region can lyse E. coli strain B but not strain K. They infected a plate of E. coli B with two types of mutant phages simultaneously. Then the lysate is split in half. One half is diluted 1e7 and plated on strain B, the other half is diluted 1e5 and plated on strain K. They found 4 plaques on K and 40 on B. I need to find the amount of recombination between the two mutations.

Wait, so the rII mutations are in the same region, right? So when two different mutant phages infect E. coli, they can undergo recombination. The ability to form plaques on strain K depends on whether the phage has a functional rII gene, I think. Because strain K is resistant unless the phage can infect it. So the phages are rII mutants, which can't infect K normally. But if during infection, recombination occurs between the two phages, a wild-type rII gene could be restored, allowing the phage to infect K.

So the experiment is about the frequency of recombination. The number of plaques on K would represent the recombinant phages that can infect K, while the plaques on B represent all the phages that can infect B, including non-recombinant and recombinant ones.

Wait, but the dilution factors are different. Let me think. The lysate is split into two halves. One half is diluted 1e7 (for B) and the other 1e5 (for K). Then plated. So when they plated them, they found 40 plaques on B and 4 on K.

So first, I probably need to calculate the total phage particles in each lysate.

Wait, the two halves are each diluted differently. The half for B is diluted by 1e7, and they got 40 plaques. So the concentration of phages in that half would be 40 * 1e7 per mL, assuming each plaque is one phage. Similarly, the K plate was diluted by 1e5 and had 4 plaques, so 4 * 1e5 per mL for that half.

But wait, since they split the lysate into two halves, each half has the same initial concentration. Let's call the concentration of each half C. Then for the B plate:

Plaques on B: 40 = C * (1e7 dilution factor) * volume plated? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of phages per mL. The formula is usually (number of plaques) = (concentration) * (dilution factor) * (volume plated). But I don't know the volume, but perhaps it's a standard volume, like 1 mL. Let's assume that they plated 1 mL each.

So for B: 40 plaques = (concentration of phages in half lysate) * (dilution factor 1e7) * 1 mL.

Similarly, for K: 4 plaques = (concentration) * (dilution factor 1e5) * 1 mL.

So, the concentration in the half-lysate for B would be 40 / (1e7) = 4e-7 phages/mL. For K, 4 / (1e5) = 4e-6 phages/mL.

Wait, but this can't be right because the same lysate is split, so the concentrations should be the same. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Each half is diluted differently, so the number of phages per mL after dilution would differ. But the actual number of phages in each half (before dilution) should be the same because they were split.

Wait, let me clarify. The lysate is split into two equal parts. Let's say each part is volume V. For B: they take V and dilute it 1e7 times, then plate some volume, say 1 mL. The number of plaques is 40. So the concentration before dilution in that half would be (40) / (1e7 * 1 mL) ) = 4e-7 phages per mL. Similarly, for K, the other half is diluted 1e5 times, then plated 1 mL, giving 4 plaques: (4) / (1e5 * 1 mL) ) = 4e-6 phages/mL.

Wait, that would mean each half has different concentrations, which doesn't make sense because they were split from the same lysate. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Oh wait, perhaps I should calculate the total number of phages in each half before dilution. For B: 40 plaques came from 1 mL of a 1e7 dilution. So the number of phages in that 1 mL is 40. Since it's a 1e7 dilution, the original number in that volume before dilution would be 40 * 1e7. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me try another approach. Let me denote the initial concentration of phages in each half as C. Each half is diluted to different extents. For B, they dilute 1e7 and plate, getting 40 plaques. So the number of phages in the diluted sample is 40. The diluted sample is 1e7 times less concentrated than the original. So the original concentration would be 40 * 1e7 per mL. Similarly, for K, the diluted sample has 4 plaques, so original is 4 * 1e5 per mL.

But wait, both samples came from the same lysate, so their concentrations should be the same. So 40e7 = 4e5? No, 40e7 is 4e8, which is much larger than 4e5. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Maybe the total number of phages in each half is the same. So for each half, the number of phages before plating is the same. Let’s say each half has N phages. When you dilute each half to different extents, you get different numbers on the plates.

For the B plate, the sample was diluted 1e7 times. So the number of phages you actually plated is N / 1e7, and that gave 40 plaques. So N / 1e7 = 40 → N = 40e7.

For the K plate, the sample was diluted 1e5 times, so N /1e5 =4 → N=4e5.

Wait, but both N should be same because they're from the same lysate half. But 40e7 is 4e8, and 4e5 is 4e5. These are different. That can't be right. So my approach must be wrong.

Hmm, maybe I should consider that the total number of phages in each half is the same. Let me denote the concentration as C.

So for the B plate: They diluted 1e7 times, so the concentration after dilution is C/1e7. They plated, say, 1 mL, so the number of phages is (C/1e7) *1 mL. This equals 40. So C/1e7 =40 → C=40e7 phages/mL.

For the K plate: They diluted 1e5 times, so concentration after dilution is C/1e5. They plated 1 mL, so (C/1e5)*1 =4 → C=4e5.

Wait, that gives two different Cs, which isn't possible. So something's wrong with my approach.

Wait, perhaps the volume plated isn't 1 mL. Maybe they plated the same volume but have different dilutions. Let's say they plated the same volume V on each.

Then for B: (C_B * V) /1e7 =40 → C_B = (40 *1e7)/V.

For K: (C_K * V)/1e5 =4 → C_K = (4 *1e5)/V.

But since C_B and C_K are the same (same lysate), so set them equal:

(40e7)/V = (4e5)/V → 40e7 =4e5 → 40,000,000=400,000? No, that's not possible.

So I'm missing something here. Maybe the way to approach it is to find the total number of phages in the lysate.

Wait, perhaps the initial lysate has a certain number of phages, and when split, each half has the same number. Let me denote the total phage count in the lysate as N. Each half has N/2 phages.

Then, when plating on B, they took half the lysate, diluted it 1e7 times, and got 40 plaques. So the number of phages in that diluted sample is 40. The sample was diluted 1e7 times, so the original number in that half is 40 *1e7.

Similarly, for K: they took the other half, diluted 1e5 times, and got 4 plaques, so original is 4 *1e5.

Since both halves are N/2, we have:

40e7 = N/2 → N=8e8.

And 4e5 = N/2 → N=8e5.

But 8e8 is not equal to 8e5. So this can't be right either.

Wait, I must be making a mistake in the setup. Let's try a different approach. Maybe I should think about the number of phages that can infect each strain.

The phages are two mutants, let's say mutant A and mutant B. Each has a mutation in rII, so they can't infect K normally. But when they infect together, sometimes they recombine, producing a phage that can infect K.

So the number of phages that can form plaques on K is equal to the number of recombinant phages, right? Because only the recombinants can infect K.

The number of plaques on K is 4, but this is after a 1e5 dilution. So the actual number of phages in the lysate that can infect K is 4 *1e5.

Similarly, the number of phages that can infect B is 40 *1e7 (after a 1e7 dilution).

But wait, the total number of phages in the lysate would be the sum of non-recombinant (which can infect B) and recombinant (which can infect both B and K).

Wait, no, all the phages can infect B, because the mutations are in rII, which affects K but not B. So B is permissive for rII mutations. So the phages are able to lyse B regardless of their rII mutation, but only the recombinant phages have a functional rII gene and can lyse K.

So the total number of phages that can infect B is the total phage count, including both parental and recombinant phages. But the number that can infect K is only the recombinant ones.

So, the number of phages that can infect B is N = 40 *1e7.

The number that can infect K is R = 4 *1e5.

But wait, the same lysate is used for both plates, so the total phage count N would be the same. But I have two different expressions for N. Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Wait, the lysate is split into two parts. Each part is diluted differently and plated on different strains. So each half of the lysate has the same concentration of phages.

But when you dilute one half 1e7 times, you get 40 plaques on B. So the concentration in that half is 40 / (dilution) = 40 /1e7 = 4e-7 phages per mL? No, wait, I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total number of phages in the lysate that can infect each strain.

The number of phages able to infect B is the total number of phages, since all can infect B. So when you plate on B, you get all phages.

But when you plate on K, you only get the recombinant phages.

Wait, but when you split the lysate, each half has the same number of phages. So for the B plate, half the lysate is diluted 1e7 times and gives 40 plaques. So the number of phages in that half is 40 *1e7.

Similarly, the other half is diluted 1e5 times and gives 4 plaques on K, so the number of phages in that half (recombinant ones) is 4 *1e5.

Wait, but the total number of phages in the lysate would be 2 * (40e7) = 8e8, because each half has 40e7 phages. But the recombinant phages are 2*(4e5) = 8e5? No, wait, because each half is processed separately.

Wait, no. Each half is processed for different strains. For B, each half has 40e7 phages. So the total lysate has 80e7 phages. But for K, each half has 4e5 phages (because 4 plaques *1e5 dilution). So total K phages would be 8e5.

But wait, this would mean that the total number of recombinant phages is 8e5, and the total phage population is 8e8. So the recombination frequency would be (8e5 / 8e8) *100% = 0.1%.

Wait, but let me make sure. So R is the number of recombinant phages in the lysate, which is 4e5 * 2 (since each half contributes 4e5/2?), no, maybe not. Because each half is diluted and plated, so the number of phages that can infect K is 4 *1e5 from one half, but the other half would have a similar amount.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the total number of recombinant phages in the entire lysate is (4 *1e5) *2? Because each half contributes 4e5 phages able to infect K. Because each half was diluted 1e5 and gave 4 plaques, so each half has 4e5 recombinant phages. So total R = 8e5.

The total number of phages in the entire lysate (both halves) would be 40e7 *2 =8e8, since each half has 40e7.

So the recombination frequency is (R / N) *100% = (8e5 /8e8)*100% = 0.1%.

So the answer would be 0.1 percent, which is option D.

To determine the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the rII region of the T4 genome, we analyze the data provided:

1. **Experimental Setup**:  
   - A lysate of phages is split into two equal halves.  
   - One half is diluted by \(10^7\) and plated on E. coli strain B, yielding 40 plaques.  
   - The other half is diluted by \(10^5\) and plated on E. coli strain K, yielding 4 plaques.  

2. **Key Observations**:  
   - All phages can infect strain B because the rII mutations do not affect infection of B. Thus, the total number of phages in the lysate can be calculated from the B plate.  
   - Only recombinant phages (those with a functional rII gene restored via recombination) can infect strain K. The number of plaques on K corresponds to the number of recombinant phages.  

3. **Calculations**:  
   - From the B plate:  
     The number of phages in the lysate is proportional to the number of plaques and the dilution factor.  
     \[
     \text{Total phages in lysate} = 40 \times 10^7 = 4 \times 10^8
     \]  
   - From the K plate:  
     The number of recombinant phages is similarly calculated:  
     \[
     \text{Recombinant phages in lysate} = 4 \times 10^5
     \]  

4. **Recombination Frequency**:  
   The recombination frequency is the ratio of recombinant phages to the total phage population, expressed as a percentage:  
   \[
   \text{Recombination frequency} = \left(\frac{\text{Recombinant phages}}{\text{Total phages}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{4 \times 10^5}{4 \times 10^8}\right) \times 100 = 0.1\%
   \]  

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The amount of recombination between the two mutations in the rII region of the T4 genome is **0.1 percent**.
