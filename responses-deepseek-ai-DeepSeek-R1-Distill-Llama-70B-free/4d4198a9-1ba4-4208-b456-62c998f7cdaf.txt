Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a cross between two yellow-haired mice, and the resulting F1 ratio is 2 yellow : 1 nonyellow : 1 yellow (which dies). Hmm, that's interesting. So the parents are both yellow, but their offspring have some that die. I remember that when dealing with crosses, it often involves dominant and recessive traits, maybe with some lethality.

The given information shows the P1 (parental) cross as Y^ly^L × Y^ly^L. Wait, the notation here is a bit confusing. Usually, we use uppercase for dominant and lowercase for recessive. So Y might be the dominant allele for yellow hair, and y the recessive. But what about the superscripts l and L? Oh, right, sometimes superscripts are used for different alleles, like maybe Y^L and Y^l. So in this case, each parent has Y^l and y^L alleles.

So when they have the F1 generation, each parent produces gametes. Let me think, each parent can produce Y^l and y^L gametes. So the possible combinations for the F1 are Y^lY^l, Y^ly^L, and y^Ly^L. Wait, but in the F1 ratio given, it's 2 yellow : 1 nonyellow : 1 yellow that dies. So that's a total of four parts, but one dies. So the actual surviving ratio is 2 yellow : 1 nonyellow.

Let me look at the F1 genotypes. The Punnett square would be:

Y^l (from first parent) × Y^l (from second) → Y^lY^l

Y^l × y^L → Y^ly^L

y^L × Y^l → Y^ly^L

y^L × y^L → y^Ly^L

Wait, no, wait. Wait, each parent contributes either Y^l or y^L. So their F1 would have four possibilities:

- Y^l from dad and Y^l from mom → Y^lY^l

- Y^l from dad and y^L from mom → Y^ly^L

- y^L from dad and Y^l from mom → Y^ly^L

- y^L from dad and y^L from mom → y^Ly^L

So the F1 genotypic ratio is 25% Y^lY^l, 50% Y^ly^L, and 25% y^Ly^L.

Now, the phenotypic ratio is 2 yellow : 1 nonyellow : 1 yellow that dies. Wait, so four parts in total. Let me see. The F1 has four genotypes, but one dies. So let's see which ones survive.

Looking at the F1, the possible genotypes are:

1. Y^lY^l: maybe this is yellow.

2. Y^ly^L: yellow?

3. y^Ly^L: nonyellow?

Wait, but the question says that one of them dies. So in the F1, perhaps one genotype is lethal. Let's see the ratios. The F1 shows 2 yellow : 1 nonyellow : 1 yellow (dies). Wait, that can't be right because the sum would be 4, but the F1 usually comes from four possibilities.

Wait, maybe the F1 ratio is 2 yellow (surviving), 1 nonyellow (surviving), and 1 yellow that dies, making a total of 4. But the ratio given is 2:1:1, but one dies, so the surviving ratio is 2:1.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to map it out. The F1 has four genotypic possibilities:

- Y^lY^l (25%): maybe this is lethal.

Wait, no. Because the question says one dies. So perhaps one of the genotypes dies. If Y^lY^l dies, then the surviving would be Y^ly^L (50%) and y^Ly^L (25%). So the ratio would be 2:1 (since 50% is twice 25%). That matches the 2 yellow to 1 nonyellow.

But wait, the problem says the F1 ratio is 2 yellow : 1 nonyellow : 1 yellow (dies). So the dead one is also yellow? So maybe the Y^lY^l is yellow but dies, and the Y^ly^L is yellow and survives, and the y^Ly^L is nonyellow and survives.

So the four F1 rats:

- Y^lY^l: yellow, dies (25%)

- Y^ly^L: yellow, survives (50%)

- y^Ly^L: nonyellow, survives (25%)

So the ratio of survivors is 2 yellow (Y^ly^L) to 1 nonyellow (y^Ly^L), because the Y^ly^L is 50% (which is 2 parts if the total is 4 parts) and the nonyellow is 25% (1 part). But wait, the given F1 ratio is 2:1:1, but the 1 yellow dies. So in the live mice, it's 2 yellow (from Y^ly^L) and 1 nonyellow (from y^Ly^L). That makes sense.

So the question is about the genotypes of the surviving mice. The yellow survivors are Y^ly^L, and the nonyellow are y^Ly^L.

Looking at the options, I need to find which option says that.

Let's go through the options.

Option A: Surviving yellow are YlyL and nonyellow are yLyL.

Wait, the options are a bit confusing. Let me check.

Option A: Surviving yellow mice are Y^l y^L (YlyL), and nonyellow are y^L y^L. So nonyellow is yLyL.

Yes, that matches what I found. The yellow survivors are Y^ly^L (which is Yl yL?), and nonyellow is y^Ly^L.

Wait, but in the question, the nonyellow is y^Ly^L, which would be homozygous recessive. So in the options, let's see.

Option A says nonyellow mice are y^Ly^L. So that's correct.

So the correct option would be A.

Wait, but let me check the other options to be sure.

Option B: Surviving yellows are Y^lY^l and nonyellow are y^Ly^L. But Y^lY^l dies, so their survivors can't be Y^lY^l. So B is wrong.

Option C: Yellows are Y^LY^L. Wait, the parents are Y^ly^L, so I don't think Y^LY^L is possible. Plus, this doesn't fit with the F1.

Option D: Surviving yellows are y^Ly^L, which doesn't make sense because y^Ly^L is nonyellow.

Option E: Yellows are Y^ly^L, nonyellow are Y^ly^L. That can't be because nonyellow would be recessive.

Option F: Yellows are y^Ly^L, which is nonyellow, so wrong.

Option G: Yellows are y^Ly^L, which is nonyellow, so wrong.

Option H: Yellows are Y^lY^l, but that's lethal, so incorrect.

Option I: Yellows are y^ly^l, which I don't think is the case.

Option J: Yellows are Y^ly^L, nonyellow are Y^Ly^L. Wait, no. Because nonyellow should be y^Ly^L, not Y^Ly^L. So J is wrong.

So the only correct option is A.

The question involves a cross between two yellow-haired mice (P1: Y^ly^L × Y^ly^L) that produces an F1 generation with a phenotypic ratio of 2 yellow : 1 nonyellow : 1 yellow (dies). The task is to determine the genotypes of the surviving mice.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Parental Cross and Gametes**: Each parent (Y^ly^L) produces two types of gametes: Y^l and y^L. This results in the following F1 genotypes:
   - **Y^lY^l** (25%): Homozygous dominant (yellow).
   - **Y^ly^L** (50%): Heterozygous (yellow).
   - **y^Ly^L** (25%): Homozygous recessive (nonyellow).

2. **Phenotypic Ratio**: The F1 phenotypic ratio is 2 yellow : 1 nonyellow : 1 yellow (dies). This indicates:
   - **Y^lY^l** is lethal (dies).
   - **Y^ly^L** survives and is yellow.
   - **y^Ly^L** survives and is nonyellow.

3. **Surviving Mice**:
   - Yellow mice: **Y^ly^L**.
   - Nonyellow mice: **y^Ly^L**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Surviving yellow mice are **Y^ly^L**, and nonyellow mice are **y^Ly^L**. This matches the analysis.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because it states that surviving yellow mice are **Y^lY^l**, which is lethal.
- **Option C**: Incorrect because it introduces **Y^LY^L**, which is not relevant to the cross.
- **Option D**: Incorrect because it states that surviving yellow mice are **y^Ly^L**, which is nonyellow.
- **Option E**: Incorrect because it states that nonyellow mice are **Y^ly^L**, which is yellow.
- **Option F**: Incorrect because it states that surviving yellow mice are **y^Ly^L**, which is nonyellow.
- **Option G**: Incorrect because it states that surviving yellow mice are **y^Ly^L**, which is nonyellow.
- **Option H**: Incorrect because it states that surviving yellow mice are **Y^lY^l**, which is lethal.
- **Option I**: Incorrect because it introduces **y^ly^l**, which is not relevant to the cross.
- **Option J**: Incorrect because it states that nonyellow mice are **Y^Ly^L**, which is yellow.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option A**, as it accurately represents the genotypes of the surviving mice: yellow mice are **Y^ly^L**, and nonyellow mice are **y^Ly^L**.
