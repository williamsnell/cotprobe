Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the net dipole moment in Debyes for two different ion separations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it step by step.

Alright, the question has two parts: part (a) and part (b). Both involve ions separated by a certain distance. I remember that dipole moment is calculated using the formula μ = q * d, where q is the charge and d is the distance between the charges.

Wait, but wait, I need to make sure about the units here. Oh right, the problem gives me that 1 Debye is 1e-18 esu-cm. And each charge is given in esu. Oh right, and the distance is given in centimeters, so that should fit right into the formula.

Let me jot down the given values:

For both parts, the separation distance is 2e-8 cm. Oh wait, no, I think each part has the same separation. Because the question says 2e-8 cm for each situation.

Wait, looking again: the question says (a) one +1 and one -1 ion separated by 2e-8 cm, and (b) one +2 and one -2 ion, same separation. So both have same d, but different charges.

So for each part, I calculate μ = q * d. But since the charges are opposite, the dipole moment direction is from positive to negative, but the magnitude would just be the product of the charges' absolute values times the distance.

Wait, but wait: in each case, the charges are equal in magnitude but opposite. So in (a), each ion has a charge of ±1, and in (b), ±2.

Wait, no: the question says in (a) one +1 and one -1. So each has magnitude 1. And in (b), each has magnitude 2.

But wait, the charge given is 4.80e-10 esu per charge. So each ion's charge is that value multiplied by the charge number. Oh, right. So for (a), each ion is +1*(4.80e-10 esu) and -1*(4.80e-10 esu). So the total charge used in the dipole calculation is the sum of the magnitudes, I think. Wait no: wait, dipole moment is the product of the charge and the separation. But since they are opposite charges, the dipole moment is q*d, where q is the magnitude of each charge. Because the charges are equal and opposite, the dipole is just charge times distance. Oh wait, no. Wait, the dipole moment is p = q * d, where q is the charge. But wait, if I have two charges, +q and -q, separated by d, then the dipole moment is q*d. Yeah, that makes sense because from the positive to the negative, so the dipole is p = q*d.

So for part (a), the charges are +q and -q, where q = 1 * 4.80e-10 esu. So q is 4.80e-10 esu.

The distance d is 2e-8 cm.

So the dipole moment μ is q*d. So:

μ = (4.80e-10 esu) * (2e-8 cm) = ?

Let me calculate that. 4.80e-10 * 2e-8 = 9.6e-18 esu·cm.

But wait, 1 Debye is 1e-18 esu·cm, so μ in Debyes is 9.6e-18 / 1e-18 = 9.6 Debyes.

Wait, but wait: is that right? Because sometimes I get confused whether it's the sum of the charges or just one charge. Oh no, dipole moment is the product of the charge and the distance. So if you have two charges of equal magnitude opposite sign, then the dipole moment is just q*d. So in part (a), q is 4.8e-10 esu. So 4.8e-10 * 2e-8 = 9.6e-18 esu·cm, which is 9.6 Debyes.

Wait, but looking back, the options don't have 9.6 as the first option except for option H, which is 9.6 and 19.2.

Wait, let me check part (b) too. In part (b), the ions are +2 and -2. So each has a charge of 2*(4.80e-10) esu. So q is 9.6e-10 esu.

Same distance, 2e-8 cm.

So dipole moment μ = 9.6e-10 * 2e-8 = (9.6 * 2) * 1e-18 = 19.2e-18 esu·cm. Which is 19.2 Debyes.

So part (a) is 9.6 D, part (b) is 19.2 D. Looking at the options, option H is 9.6 Debyes and 19.2 Debyes.

Wait, but wait the question is asking for the net dipole moment in each case. So for each, it's just one dipole, so the numbers I have are correct.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Part (a):

q = 1 * 4.80e-10 = 4.80e-10 esu.

d = 2e-8 cm.

μ = 4.80e-10 * 2e-8 = 9.6e-18 esu·cm = 9.6 Debye.

Part (b):

q = 2 * 4.80e-10 = 9.60e-10 esu.

d = same 2e-8 cm.

μ = 9.60e-10 * 2e-8 = (9.6e-10) * (2e-8) = 1.92e-17 esu·cm.

Wait wait, 9.6e-10 * 2e-8 is 1.92e-17? Wait no: 9.6e-10 * 2e-8 = (9.6 * 2) * 1e-10 *1e-8 = 19.2e-18 = 1.92e-17.

But 1e-18 is 1 Debye, so 1.92e-17 is 19.2 Debyes.

Yes, that's correct.

So for part (a): 9.6 D, part (b): 19.2 D. Looking at the options, option H is 9.6 and 19.2.

So the answer should be H.

Wait, but another thought: are the ions point charges? Well, the question treats them as such, so yes. So the calculation holds.

To calculate the net dipole moment in Debyes for the given situations, we use the formula for dipole moment:

\[
\mu = q \cdot d
\]

where \( q \) is the charge in esu and \( d \) is the separation distance in cm. The conversion factor is \( 1 \, \text{Debye} = 1 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{esu} \cdot \text{cm} \).

### Part (a): One +1 and one -1 ion separated by \( 2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \)
- The charge magnitude for each ion is \( q = 1 \cdot 4.80 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{esu} = 4.80 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{esu} \).
- The separation distance is \( d = 2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \).
- The dipole moment is:

\[
\mu = (4.80 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-8}) = 9.6 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{esu} \cdot \text{cm}
\]

Converting to Debyes:

\[
\mu = \frac{9.6 \times 10^{-18}}{1 \times 10^{-18}} = 9.6 \, \text{Debyes}.
\]

### Part (b): One +2 and one -2 ion separated by \( 2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \)
- The charge magnitude for each ion is \( q = 2 \cdot 4.80 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{esu} = 9.60 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{esu} \).
- The separation distance is \( d = 2 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \).
- The dipole moment is:

\[
\mu = (9.60 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-8}) = 1.92 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{esu} \cdot \text{cm}
\]

Converting to Debyes:

\[
\mu = \frac{1.92 \times 10^{-17}}{1 \times 10^{-18}} = 19.2 \, \text{Debyes}.
\]

### Final Answer
For part (a), the dipole moment is \( 9.6 \, \text{Debyes} \), and for part (b), it is \( 19.2 \, \text{Debyes} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**H: 9.6 Debyes, 19.2 Debyes**
