Alright, so I'm trying to solve this AC series RC circuit problem. Let me see what I remember from my classes. Okay, the question says that a load dissipates 1.5 kW of power, and the power factor is 0.75. I need to find the reactive power (Pr) and the apparent power (Pa), and then choose the correct option from the given list.

Wait, I think the power factor (pf) is the cosine of the phase angle between voltage and current. Oh right, because in AC circuits, the power factor tells us how much of the apparent power is actually doing real work (the true power). So, if the power factor is 0.75, that means the true power (P) is 0.75 times the apparent power (Pa). Because P = pf * Pa.

Wait, but let me get the formulas straight. The real power P is given by P = Vrms * Irms * pf. And the apparent power S is Vrms * Irms. So S would be the vector sum of real and reactive power. Oh right, S^2 = P^2 + Pr^2, where Pr is the reactive power.

So I have P = 1500 W, since 1.5 kW is 1500 W. And pf is 0.75. So first, I can find the apparent power using P = pf * S. So rearranging, S = P / pf.

Let me calculate that. S = 1500 W / 0.75. Hmm, 1500 divided by 0.75... 0.75 is 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 1500 * 4/3 equals 2000 W, which is 2 kVA. So apparent power Pa is 2 kVA.

Wait, but the question asks for Pa in kVA, and Pr in kVAR. So Pa is 2 kVA, which is 2. So that's one part done.

Now, for the reactive power Pr. Using the formula S^2 = P^2 + Pr^2. We have S=2000 W, P=1500 W. So plugging in:

2000² = 1500² + Pr²
4,000,000 = 2,250,000 + Pr²
Pr² = 4,000,000 - 2,250,000 = 1,750,000
Taking square root: Pr = sqrt(1,750,000) = 1,322.88... Approximately 1320 W, which is 1.32 kVAR.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, since pf = cos(theta) = 0.75, then the reactive power factor would be sin(theta). Because in an RC circuit, the current lags the voltage, so the reactive power is positive (since it's capacitive, but wait, no: in a series RC circuit, the current lags, so it's inductive, so the reactive power would be positive as well, I think. Wait, no, wait, no, in a series RC circuit, the capacitor stores energy, but the phase angle determines whether it leads or lags. Wait, no: in a purely capacitive circuit, current leads voltage. But in an RC circuit, depending on R and Xc, it could be leading or lagging. Wait, no, no, in an RC circuit (resistor and capacitor in series), the impedance is R - jXc. So the current leads the voltage because the capacitor's impedance is negative in the denominator. So the power factor is leading, which would mean that the reactive power is negative? Or is that only in RL circuits?

Wait, but the power factor is given as 0.75, which is positive. Typically, power factor is the absolute value unless specified otherwise. So perhaps I can ignore the sign here since the question just asks for the magnitude.

But going back, Pr is calculated as sqrt(S² - P²), which gives the magnitude. So from earlier, Pr is 1.32 kVAR.

So the list would be [1.32, 2.0], but wait, looking at the units: the question says Pr in kVAR and Pa in kVA. So yes, that makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option B is [1.32, 1.5] → No, because Pa is 2.0, not 1.5.

Option E is [1.5, 2.0] → That's Pr as 1.5, which doesn't match.

Option H is [1.8, 2.4] → No.

Option J is [0.9, 1.8] → No.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, S is 2000 W, which is 2 kVA. So that's correct.

Pr² = S² - P² = (2000)^2 - (1500)^2 = 4e6 - 2.25e6 = 1.75e6 → Pr = sqrt(1.75e6) = sqrt(1750000) = 1320 approximately.

Wait, 1320 W is 1.32 kVAR. So the list is [1.32, 2.0].

Looking back at the options, option B is [1.32, 1.5], which is incorrect because the second value is 1.5. Option E is [1.5, 2.0], but the first is 1.5. Hmm, none of the options seems to have [1.32, 2.0]. Wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: [1.32, 1.5] → Pa is 1.5 kVA? But Pa is 2.0 kVA as I calculated. So that's not possible.

Option E: [1.5, 2.0] → Pr is 1.5 kVAR, which would be 1500. But our calculation is 1.32, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recalculate S.

Given P = 1500 W, pf = 0.75. So S = P / pf = 1500 / 0.75 = 2000 W, yes, correct.

Pr = sqrt(S^2 - P^2) → sqrt(2000² -1500²) = sqrt(4e6 -2.25e6)=sqrt(1.75e6)= approx 1320 W, which is 1.32 kVAR.

So the list should be [1.32, 2.0]. But looking at the options, the only one with 2.0 as the second element is option E and option D. Option E: [1.5,2.0], option B is [1.32,1.5], no. Wait, perhaps the options don't have the correct option. Wait, looking again:

Options:

A: [1.5, 1.5]

B: [1.32,1.5]

C: [1.0,2.0]

D: [0.75, 2.0]

E: [1.5, 2.0]

F: [2.25,3.0]

G: [2.0,1.32]

H: [1.8,2.4]

I: [1.2,1.0]

J: [0.9,1.8]

Hmm, none of the options exactly match [1.32, 2.0]. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: since the power factor is 0.75, which is the ratio of real power to apparent power. So P = pf * S → S = P / pf = 1500 / 0.75 = 2000 W. So S is 2 kVA.

Now, for reactive power, another formula: Pr = P * tan(theta), where theta is the phase angle. But wait, since power factor is 0.75, which is cos(theta) = 0.75, so theta is arccos(0.75). Then sin(theta) would be sqrt(1 - 0.75²) = sqrt(1 - 0.5625) = sqrt(0.4375) = approx 0.6614. So Pr = P * tan(theta) = P * (sin(theta)/cos(theta)) = P * (0.6614/0.75) ≈ 1500 * 0.8819 ≈ 1320 W, which is 1.32 kVAR. So same as before.

So the correct values are Pr=1.32 kVAR, Pa=2.0 kVA. So the list is [1.32, 2.0], but none of the options exactly match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Oh wait, the question says "reactive power (Pr)" and "apparent power (Pa)".

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the apparent power in kVA and reactive in kVAR, so the correct answer should have 1.32 and 2.0. But looking at the options, I don't see this combination. So am I missing something?

Wait, maybe I miscalculated S. Let me recheck: 1500 / 0.75 is indeed 2000, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different sign convention. Oh wait, in a series RC circuit, the current leads voltage, so the reactive power would be negative if we're considering capacitive. But the question just asks for the magnitude, I think. So the value would still be positive.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo, but since I have to choose from the given options, maybe I should look for the closest one. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let me try another approach. The power factor is 0.75, so the angle theta is cos^(-1)(0.75). So theta is approximately 41.41 degrees.

In a series RC circuit, the impedance Z = R + (1/jωC) = R - jXc. So the current leads the voltage, making the power factor leading. But since power factor is given as 0.75, which is the absolute value, perhaps it's treated as a lagging case? That would change the sign, but the magnitude remains the same.

Wait, but no, in a series RC circuit, the current leads, so it's a leading power factor, which would have a positive reactive power for capacitive. But the calculation remains the same.

Wait, perhaps the question expects us to use a different approach, like using the relationship between real, reactive, and apparent power.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the question is asking for the apparent power correctly. Let me think: apparent power is the vector sum of real and reactive power. So S = sqrt(P² + Pr²). So if P is 1500 and Pr is 1.32 *1000=1320, then S would be sqrt(1500² +1320²) = sqrt(2.25e6 + 1.7424e6)=sqrt(3.9924e6)=1998 approx 2000, which matches.

Wait, so I think the calculations are correct. But none of the options match [1.32, 2.0]. So perhaps I made a mistake in reading the options. Let me check again.

Looking at the options:

Option B is [1.32,1.5] → Pa is 1.5, which is wrong because Pa is 2.0.

Option E is [1.5, 2.0] → Pr is 1.5, which is less than what we have.

Option C is [1.0,2.0] → Pr is 1.0.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the power factor formula. Let me think: power factor is real power over apparent, so P = pf * S → S = P/pf.

Alternatively, perhaps the question provides the power as 1.5 kW, which is 1500 W, and the power factor is 0.75. So using Pythagoras' theorem: S^2 = P^2 + Pr^2 → Pr = sqrt(S^2 - P^2) = sqrt( (2000)^2 - (1500)^2 ) = sqrt(4e6 - 2.25e6) = sqrt(1.75e6) = approx 1320 W.

So the list is [1320 W, 2000 VA], which is [1.32, 2.0] in kVAR and kVA.

Looking back at the options, none of them seem to have this exact combination. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Wait, the question says "represent the answer in a list [Pr, Pa] with unit kVAR and kVA respectively."

So Pr is 1.32 kVAR and Pa is 2.0 kVA. So the list would be [1.32, 2.0], but I don't see this option. Wait, looking again: option B is [1.32, 1.5], option E is [1.5,2.0]. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the options are mislabeled. Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of S. Let me recheck:

P = 1500 W, pf = 0.75.

S = P / pf = 1500 / 0.75 = 2000 W = 2 kVA. That's correct.

So Pa is 2.0 kVA, Pr is 1.32 kVAR.

Looking at the options, the only one with Pa as 2.0 is options C, D, E. Option E has Pr as 1.5, which is higher than 1.32. Option C has Pr as 1.0, which is lower. So none match.

Wait, perhaps the question uses a different formula, maybe considering the power factor as the ratio of reactive to apparent power? No, that's not correct. Power factor is always the ratio of real to apparent.

Wait, perhaps the power factor is given as leading, so the reactive power would be negative, but the magnitude remains the same. So the answer remains [1.32, 2.0].

But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try alternative approach.

Wait, let me compute the current and voltages. Suppose V is the voltage, I is the current.

In an RC series circuit, the impedance Z = sqrt(R² + (1/(ωC))²). The current I = V / Z.

The real power P = I² R.

The reactive power Pr = I² (1/(ωC)).

The power factor pf = R / Z = 0.75.

So Z = R / 0.75.

Then, P = I² R = (V^2 / Z²) * R.

But let me think, perhaps using ratios.

We have pf = R / Z = 0.75 → Z = R / 0.75.

So, the apparent power S = V * I = V * (V / Z) = V² / Z.

But let me express everything in terms of P and Pr.

Alternatively, from the definitions:

P = pf * S → S = P / pf = 2000 W.

Pr = S * sin(theta), where theta is the phase angle.

Since pf = cos(theta) = 0.75 → sin(theta) = sqrt(1 - 0.75²) = sqrt(0.4375) ≈ 0.6614.

So Pr = S * sin(theta) = 2000 * 0.6614 ≈ 1320 W → 1.32 kVAR.

So again, same result.

Hmm, perhaps I need to look back at the options. Oh wait, option B is [1.32, 1.5] → but 1.5 is less than 2.0. So that can't be right. Maybe the options have a typo, but since I have to choose from them, perhaps the intended answer is option E, but that would give a Pr of 1.5, which is higher than what I calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me think: is the power factor 0.75 leading or lagging? Wait, in an RC circuit, the current leads, so the power factor is leading, which would mean the reactive power is negative. But the question probably just wants the magnitude.

Wait, perhaps the power factor is given as 0.75, which could be either leading or lagging. But the calculation remains the same because we take the absolute value for the magnitude.

Wait, I'm stuck because according to my calculations, the correct answer isn't among the options. But perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me try calculating Pr another way. Since pf = 0.75 = 3/4, then the ratio of Pr to P is (sqrt(1 - pf²)) / pf.

So Pr = P * sqrt(1 - pf²) / pf.

That would be 1500 * sqrt(1 - 0.75²) / 0.75.

sqrt(1 - 0.5625) = sqrt(0.4375) ≈ 0.6614.

So Pr = 1500 * 0.6614 / 0.75 → 1500 * 0.881866 ≈ 1320 W.

Same result. So I think the correct answer isn't listed. But perhaps I should choose the closest option.

Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the question. The question says "reactive power (Pr)" and "apparent power (Pa)".

Wait, perhaps in the question, the power is given as 1.5 kW, but it's the apparent power, not the real power. No, the question says it's the power dissipated, which is real power, P.

Wait, but perhaps the question is phrased differently. Let me read it again.

"A load dissipates 1.5kW of power in an ac series RC circuit. Given that the power factor is 0.75, what is its reactive power (Pr)? What is its apparent power (Pa)?"

So P = 1.5 kW, pf = 0.75. So S = 2 kVA, Pr = 1.32 kVAR.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, which is [1.32, 1.5], but that would mean S is 1.5 kVA, which would make P = pf * S = 0.75 * 1.5 = 1.125 kW, which doesn't match the given 1.5 kW.

Wait, this suggests that option B would have P = 1.125 kW, which is not the case. So that can
