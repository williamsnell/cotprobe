Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Piaget and his theories on children. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my developmental psychology, but let's try to think this through.

The question is asking, according to Piaget, children are ___________. The options are A through J. I remember that Piaget was a big name in child development, so his theories must be one of the key points here.

Wait, Piaget's theory is about cognitive development, right? He proposed that children go through different stages of thinking. I think he believed that kids aren't just passive recipients of information but are active in constructing their own understanding of the world. So, like, they experiment and learn through experience.

I remember something about schemas—those mental frameworks that help organize knowledge. And as kids interact with their environment, they either assimilate new info into existing schemas or accommodate by changing their schemas. So Piaget's view is that children are actively trying to make sense of their world, not just soaking up what's around them passively.

Now, looking at the options. Option A says "Unable to learn complex concepts." But I think Piaget actually said that children can handle complex ideas, just in a different way than adults. So A might not be correct.

Option B is "Blank slates." Wait, isn't that more of a tabula rasa idea, which I think is from Locke? He suggested we're born blank and experience writes on us. But Piaget's more about active construction, so B might not be right.

Option C: "Little artists." Not sure about that. I don't recall Piaget using that term. It might be from someone else, maybe Montessori or another theorist.

Option D: "Little scientists." Oh wait, this rings a bell. I think Piaget described children as little scientists because they explore, experiment, and try to understand the world through active experimentation. That fits with his idea of them constructing knowledge.

Option E: "Little philosophers." Not sure, but that doesn't sound familiar. Maybe another theory or a misremembered term.

Option F: Shaped by their environment only. That sounds more like behaviorism, where environment is the main factor. Piaget's more about the interaction between the child and environment, so F might not be right.

Option G: Shaped by culture. I think Vygotsky was more into sociocultural influences, so G might be more aligned with him than Piaget.

Option H: Less intelligent than adults. Piaget didn't say they were less intelligent, just that their thinking was qualitatively different. So H is probably not correct.

Option I: Just smaller versions of adults. No, Piaget emphasized that children think differently, not just scaled-down versions. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Influenced by genetics only. That's too narrow. Piaget's stages are about cognitive development influenced by interaction with the environment, not just genetics.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: "Little scientists." Because Piaget viewed children as actively exploring and constructing their knowledge, much like scientists conducting experiments.

According to Piaget, children are actively engaged in constructing their understanding of the world through exploration and experimentation, much like scientists. This aligns with his view of children as "little scientists."
