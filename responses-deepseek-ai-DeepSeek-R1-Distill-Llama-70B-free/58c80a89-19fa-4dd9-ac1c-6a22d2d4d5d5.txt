Question:

As scotch whiskey ages, its value increases. One dollar of scotch at year 0 is worth $V(t) = exp{2\sqrt{t} - 0.15t}$ dollars at time t. If the interest rate is 5 percent, after how many years should a person sell scotch in order to maximize the PDV of this sale?

A: 25
B: 30
C: 50 years
D: 40 years
E: 22 years
F: 10 years
G: 15 years
H: 20
I: 35
J: 18 years

Okay, so I've got this problem about scotch whiskey aging and maximizing the present discounted value (PDV). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on calculus and PDV, but let's try to break it down.

The problem says that the value of the scotch at time t is given by V(t) = exp(2√t - 0.15t). I need to find the time t when the PDV is maximized, given an interest rate of 5 percent. 

Wait, I remember that PDV is calculated by taking the future value and discounting it back to the present using the discount rate. So PDV at time t would be V(t) divided by (1 + interest rate)^t. But since the interest rate is given as 5%, that becomes (1.05)^t.

So, the PDV function should be something like PDV(t) = V(t) / (1.05)^t. Substituting V(t), that's PDV(t) = exp(2√t - 0.15t) / (1.05)^t. 

Wait, but exponentials can be tricky. Let me write this as PDV(t) = exp(2√t - 0.15t - rt), where r is the interest rate. Oh right, because 1/(1.05)^t = exp(-rt ln(1.05)), but wait, maybe I should handle it differently.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The discounting factor is (1.05)^t, so the PDV is V(t) multiplied by (1/(1.05)^t), which can be written as exp(2√t - 0.15t) * exp(-rt), where r is 0.05. So combining the exponents, it's exp(2√t - 0.15t - 0.05t). So that simplifies to exp(2√t - 0.20t).

So PDV(t) = e^{2√t - 0.2t}. Now, to maximize PDV(t), I need to find the maximum of this function. Since the exponential function is always positive and increasing, the maximum of PDV(t) occurs where the exponent is maximized. So I can just find the maximum of f(t) = 2√t - 0.2t.

So f(t) = 2√t - 0.2t. To find its maximum, take the derivative with respect to t and set it to zero.

The derivative f’(t) is (2*(1/(2√t))) - 0.2. That's because the derivative of 2√t is 2*(1/(2√t)) = 1/√t, and the derivative of -0.2t is -0.2.

So f’(t) = (1/(√t)) - 0.2. Setting this equal to zero for critical points:

1/√t - 0.2 = 0 → 1/√t = 0.2 → √t = 1/0.2 = 5 → t = (5)^2 = 25.

Wait, so t is 25 years. But let me double-check my steps because the options include 25 as option A.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake in the discounting part? Let me think again. The PDV is V(t) times the discount factor. So V(t) is exp(2√t -0.15t), and the discount factor is exp(-rt), where r is 0.05, so combining exponents, it's 2√t -0.15t - 0.05t = 2√t -0.20t. So yes, that's correct.

So the exponent is 2√t - 0.2t, and finding where its derivative is zero gives t=25. So the maximum PDV occurs at t=25 years. Looking at the options, option A is 25. So the answer should be A:25.

But wait, let me make sure. Another way to approach it: perhaps I should have considered the natural logarithm of PDV to make differentiation easier, but since the exponential is a monotonic function, maximizing PDV is the same as maximizing the exponent. So yes, same result.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes in these optimization problems, you might have constraints or check the second derivative to ensure it's a maximum. The second derivative of f(t) would tell us if it's a max or min.

f'(t) = 1/√t - 0.2. The second derivative f''(t) is (-1/(2 t^(3/2))). Since f''(t) is negative for t>0, the function is concave down, so the critical point at t=25 is indeed a maximum.

So yeah, the correct answer is 25 years, which is option A.

To determine the optimal time to sell the scotch whiskey and maximize the present discounted value (PDV), we start with the given value function:

\[
V(t) = \exp(2\sqrt{t} - 0.15t)
\]

The PDV is calculated by discounting the future value back to the present using the interest rate of 5%. The PDV function becomes:

\[
\text{PDV}(t) = \frac{V(t)}{(1.05)^t} = \exp(2\sqrt{t} - 0.15t) \cdot \exp(-0.05t) = \exp(2\sqrt{t} - 0.20t)
\]

To maximize the PDV, we need to maximize the exponent:

\[
f(t) = 2\sqrt{t} - 0.20t
\]

Taking the derivative of \( f(t) \) with respect to \( t \):

\[
f'(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} - 0.20
\]

Setting \( f'(t) = 0 \) to find the critical points:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} - 0.20 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} = 0.20 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{t} = 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = 25
\]

To confirm this is a maximum, we check the second derivative:

\[
f''(t) = -\frac{1}{2t^{3/2}}
\]

Since \( f''(t) < 0 \) for \( t > 0 \), the function is concave down, and \( t = 25 \) is indeed the point of maximum PDV.

Thus, the optimal time to sell the scotch whiskey is **25 years**, corresponding to option **A**.
