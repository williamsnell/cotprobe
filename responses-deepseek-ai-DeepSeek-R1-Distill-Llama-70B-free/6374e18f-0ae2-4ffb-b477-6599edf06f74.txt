Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the mass of water to make a certain molality solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says we have 293 grams of NaCl, and the formula weight is 58.5 g per mole. We need to find out how much water to add to get a 0.25 molal solution. Molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent, right?

Wait, wait. So the formula is molality (m) equals moles of solute (n) divided by kilograms of solvent (water in this case). So m = n / kg_water.

First, I need to find the number of moles of NaCl. Moles are mass divided by molar mass. So n = mass / formula weight.

The mass of NaCl is 293 grams. Formula weight is 58.5 g/mol. So n = 293 / 58.5. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 58.5 times 5 is 292.5, so 293 is about 5.001 moles. So approximately 5 moles of NaCl.

Wait, let me double-check that. 58.5 multiplied by 5 is 292.5, so 293 is 5.001... so yeah, about 5 moles. So n is approximately 5.

The desired molality is 0.25 m. So setting up the equation: m = n / kg_water.

We can rearrange this to solve for kg_water, which would be kg_water = n / m.

Plugging in the numbers: kg_water = 5 / 0.25. 5 divided by 0.25 is 20. So that's 20 kg of water.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. So the question is asking for the mass of water. So since kg_water is 20, then the mass is 20 kg, which is 20,000 grams. That makes sense.

Looking at the options, option C is 20 kg H2O. So the answer should be C.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let's think again: moles of NaCl is mass (293g) divided by 58.5 g/mol = approx 5 mol. Molality is 0.25, so 5 / 0.25 = 20 kg water. Yep, that's correct.

To determine the mass of water needed to prepare a 0.25 molal solution with 293 g of NaCl (formula weight = 58.5 g/mol), we use the formula for molality:

\[
m = \frac{n}{\text{kg of solvent}}
\]

Where:
- \( m \) is the molality of the solution (0.25 m in this case),
- \( n \) is the number of moles of the solute (NaCl),
- kg of solvent is the mass of the solvent (water) in kilograms.

### Step 1: Calculate the moles of NaCl
The number of moles of NaCl is given by:

\[
n = \frac{\text{mass of NaCl}}{\text{formula weight of NaCl}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
n = \frac{293 \, \text{g}}{58.5 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 5 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for the mass of water
Rearranging the molality formula to solve for the mass of water:

\[
\text{kg of water} = \frac{n}{m}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{kg of water} = \frac{5 \, \text{mol}}{0.25 \, \text{mol/kg}} = 20 \, \text{kg}
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the options
The calculated mass of water is 20 kg, which corresponds to option **C**.
