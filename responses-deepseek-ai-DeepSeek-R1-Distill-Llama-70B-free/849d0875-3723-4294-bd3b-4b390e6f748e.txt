Okay, so I have this temperature conversion problem to solve. The question is about converting -10°C to both Fahrenheit and Kelvin. Hmm, I think I remember the formulas for converting between these scales. Let me try to recall them.

First, for Celsius to Fahrenheit, the formula is F = (C * 9/5) + 32. Right, because Fahrenheit and Celsius have different zero points and scales. So if I plug in -10 for C, that should give me the Fahrenheit temperature.

Let me calculate that. So, -10 multiplied by 9/5. Let's see, 10 times 9 is 90, divided by 5 is 18. But since it's -10, that's -18. Then add 32 to that. So -18 +32 is 14. Oh wait, so Fahrenheit would be 14°F. Wait, but I'm not sure if I did that right. Let me double-check: (-10 * 9/5) is indeed -18, and adding 32 gives 14. Yeah, that seems correct.

Now for the Kelvin scale. I remember that Kelvin is Celsius plus 273.15. So K = C + 273.15. So if C is -10, then K is -10 + 273.15. Let's calculate that. 273.15 minus 10 is 263.15 K. But wait, the options probably round this. 263.15 is approximately 263 K. 

So putting it together, Fahrenheit is 14°F and Kelvin is approximately 263 K. Now, I look at the options to see which one matches both.

Looking at the options:

Option G says 14°F and 263K. That matches my calculations. Let me check the other options just to be sure.

Option E is 14°F and 250K. Oh, but 250 is much lower than 263, so that's not right. Option G is the only one with 14°F and 263K. Yeah, that's the correct one.

To convert -10°C to Fahrenheit and Kelvin:

1. **Celsius to Fahrenheit**:  
   The formula is \( F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32 \).  
   Substituting \( C = -10 \):  
   \[
   F = \frac{9}{5}(-10) + 32 = -18 + 32 = 14^\circ \text{F}.
   \]

2. **Celsius to Kelvin**:  
   The formula is \( K = C + 273.15 \).  
   Substituting \( C = -10 \):  
   \[
   K = -10 + 273.15 = 263.15 \, \text{K} \approx 263 \, \text{K}.
   \]

The equivalent readings are \( 14^\circ \text{F} \) and \( 263 \, \text{K} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is **G: 14°F and 263K**.
