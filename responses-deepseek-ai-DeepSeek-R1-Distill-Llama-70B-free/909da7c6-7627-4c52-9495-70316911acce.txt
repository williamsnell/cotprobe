Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the volume of a hydrogen sulfide gas sample. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on gas laws, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says: A 0.17 g sample of H₂S gas. I need to find its volume at 27°C and 380 torr. The options are from A to J, so I have to pick the right one.

First, I remember that gas volume calculations usually involve the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. Right, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.

So I need to find the number of moles of H₂S. The mass is given as 0.17 grams. To find moles, I should calculate the molar mass of H₂S.

Hydrogen (H) has an atomic weight of about 1.008 g/mol. Sulfur (S) is around 32.07 g/mol. So H₂S would be (2 * 1.008) + 32.07. Let me calculate that: 2.016 + 32.07 = 34.086 g/mol. So the molar mass is approximately 34.086 g/mol.

Moles (n) = mass (m) / molar mass (M). So n = 0.17 g / 34.086 g/mol. Let me do that division. Hmm, 0.17 divided by 34.086. Let me approximate: 34.086 goes into 0.17 about 0.005 times. Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 34.086 times 0.005 is 0.17043. Oh wait, that's almost exactly 0.17 grams. So n is approximately 0.005 moles.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. 34.086 * 0.005 = 0.17043 grams. Oh, so 0.17 grams is just a little less than 0.005 moles. So maybe 0.17 /34.086 = approximately 0.004986 mol. Let's say approximately 0.005 mol. That's close enough for now.

Next step is to plug into the ideal gas equation. I need to find V, so I'll rearrange the equation to V = nRT/P.

Wait, but I have to make sure all units are compatible. Let's see:

Temperature T is given in Celsius, 27°C. I need to convert that to Kelvin. So T = 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 K. Approximately 300 K.

Pressure P is given in torr. I remember that the gas constant R has different values depending on the units. Since I'm using torr, which is a pressure unit, I should use R as 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) or another version with torr. Wait, no, R can also be 62.36 L·torr/(mol·K). Let me confirm that. Yes, R is 62.36 when using torr, because 1 atm is 760 torr, and 0.0821 * 760 ≈ 62.36.

So R is 62.36 L·torr/(mol·K).

Now plug in the numbers:

V = (n R T) / P.

n is approximately 0.005 mol.

So V = (0.005 mol) * (62.36 L·torr/mol·K) * (300 K) / (380 torr).

Let me compute the numerator first: 0.005 * 62.36 * 300.

Wait, 0.005 * 62.36 is 0.3118. Then 0.3118 * 300 = 93.54. So numerator is 93.54 (L·torr).

Denominator is 380 torr.

So V = 93.54 / 380. Let me compute that. Hmm, 380 goes into 93.54 how many times? Let's see. 380 * 0.246 is 93.48. So 0.246 approximately. That's about 0.246 liters.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.246 liters. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

n = 0.17 /34.086 = approximately 0.004986 mol. Let's use exact value for better accuracy.

n = 0.17 /34.086 ≈ 0.004986 mol.

R is 62.36 L·torr/(mol·K).

T is 300 K.

P is 380 torr.

So V = (0.004986 * 62.36 * 300)/380.

Compute numerator: 0.004986 *62.36 = let's calculate that.

62.36 * 0.004 is 0.24944, and 62.36 * 0.000986 is approximately 0.0615. So total is about 0.3109. Then multiply by 300: 0.3109 *300 =93.27.

Divide by 380: 93.27 /380 = 0.2454 liters, which is about 0.245 liters. Rounding to three decimal places, that's 0.245, so 0.245 liters. The option G is 0.246, which is very close.

So I think the correct answer is G. Let me make sure none of the other options are close. The other options are A:2.5, B:34, which are way too big. E is 0.5, which is double. D is 0.1, which is less. So yeah, G is correct.

To determine the volume of a 0.17 g sample of H₂S gas at 27°C and 380 torr, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = nRT \quad \text{or rearranged as} \quad V = \frac{nRT}{P}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the number of moles of H₂S
The molar mass of H₂S is calculated as:
\[
\text{Molar mass of H₂S} = (2 \times 1.008) + 32.07 = 34.086 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
The number of moles (\(n\)) is given by:
\[
n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{0.17}{34.086} \approx 0.004986 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Convert temperature to Kelvin
The temperature in Kelvin is:
\[
T = 27 + 273.15 = 300.15 \, \text{K} \approx 300 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 3: Use the ideal gas law
The gas constant \(R\) in units of \(\text{L·torr/(mol·K)}\) is \(62.36\). Substituting into the equation:
\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P}
\]
\[
V = \frac{(0.004986)(62.36)(300)}{380}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
0.004986 \times 62.36 = 0.3109 \quad \text{and} \quad 0.3109 \times 300 = 93.27
\]
Now divide by the pressure:
\[
V = \frac{93.27}{380} \approx 0.245 \, \text{liters}
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The calculated volume is approximately \(0.245 \, \text{liters}\), which is closest to option **G: 0.246 liters**.

### Final Answer:
G
