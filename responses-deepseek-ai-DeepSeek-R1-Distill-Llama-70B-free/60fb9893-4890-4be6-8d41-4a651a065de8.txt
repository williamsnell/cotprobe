Okay, so I have this economics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two parts. First, it mentions the capital/output ratio being 2.5, and the GNP rising from $985 billion to $1,055 billion. I'm supposed to find out by how much investment can be expected to increase, assuming no depreciation. Second, it gives the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) as 0.5 and asks what the extra changes in GNP will be induced by the original rise.

Hmm. Let's tackle each part one by one.

Starting with the first part: capital/output ratio and GNP change. I remember that the capital/output ratio (sometimes called the ICOR, Incremental Capital Output Ratio) is the amount of investment needed to produce one unit of output. So if the ratio is 2.5, that means for every dollar of output (GNP) increase, you need $2.5 of investment.

Wait, wait. Wait, no, maybe I have that backward. Let me think. The capital-output ratio is usually the amount of capital required per unit of output. So if the ratio is 2.5, then for each additional $1 of GNP, you need $2.5 of investment. Because the ratio is capital/output, so investment (capital) is 2.5 times the change in output.

So, the change in GNP here is from 985 to 1055 billion. Let's calculate that change. 1055 minus 985 is... 70 billion. So the increase in GNP is $70 billion.

If the capital/output ratio is 2.5, then the required investment would be 2.5 multiplied by the change in GNP. So 2.5 * 70 = 175 billion. So investment increases by $175 billion.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, but wait, the question says "assuming no depreciation." Hmm, does that affect anything? Oh, right, depreciation is a factor in the capital consumption allowance, but in this case, since there's no depreciation, the investment is just the addition to the capital stock. So yes, the calculation stands as 175 billion.

Okay, so the first part answer is $175 billion. Now looking at the options, option D has $175 billion as the first part.

Now the second part: the marginal propensity to consume is 0.5. The question is about the extra changes in GNP induced by the original rise. So this sounds like the multiplier effect.

Wait, but how does this tie into the initial increase in investment? Because the initial change was due to investment, leading to higher output, which then increases consumption, and so on.

I remember that the multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC). So with MPC of 0.5, the multiplier is 1/(1-0.5) = 2. So any initial change in spending (like investment) leads to a multiplied change in GNP.

Wait, but wait. The initial rise in GNP was $70 billion, right? But wait, no. Or is the initial change in investment the $175 billion? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. The initial change in GNP was $70 billion (from 985 to 1055). But that GNP change was due to an increase in investment. So the multiplier would apply to the increase in investment, not the GNP change. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of injections and withdrawals. The initial injection is the increase in investment, which is $175 billion. Then, the multiplier effect would be applied to this.

Wait, but wait, in the first part, the increase in GNP is 70 billion, which is due to the increase in investment of 175 billion. But that's using the capital/output ratio. So the capital/output ratio approach gives the required investment for a certain GNP growth, but the multiplier approach is about how an increase in investment leads to a multiplied increase in GNP.

Wait, but perhaps the way the question is structured is that the initial GNP increase is due to some exogenous factor, say an increase in investment. But then, that leads to further increases in GNP via the multiplier.

Wait, no, perhaps the second part is asking about the multiplier effect from the initial investment increase. Let's think again.

So the first part: the increase in GNP is 70 billion, leading to an investment increase of 175 billion.

But the second part is about the extra changes in GNP induced by the original rise. So the original rise is the 70 billion increase in GNP. But with the multiplier, the total change would be larger, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the initial GNP increase of 70 billion is due to an increase in investment of 175 billion. Now, that investment would have caused an increase in GNP beyond just that 70 billion via the multiplier. Or perhaps the 70 billion is the total change, but the question is getting at the induced changes beyond the initial investment.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the two concepts here. Let me try to clarify.

The capital/output ratio approach is used to find the required investment to achieve a certain GNP growth. So, for a $70 billion increase in GNP, you need $175 billion investment.

But then, the multiplier effect comes into play when that investment leads to increased income, which leads to increased consumption, and so on, amplifying the effect.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: "what will be the extra changes in GNP induced by the original rise?" So the original rise is the $70 billion increase. But perhaps the 'original rise' refers to the rise in investment. Alternatively, perhaps the initial rise in GNP is due to increased investment, and that leads to further increases via the multiplier.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is this: The initial increase in investment is $175 billion. This causes an increase in GNP, but the multiplier makes the total increase larger.

Wait, but in our initial calculation, the increase in GNP is $70 billion, which would mean that the investment of 175 billion caused a 70 billion increase. That seems like a multiplier of less than 1, which can't be right because the multiplier is usually greater than 1.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.

The capital/output ratio (v) is 2.5. So v = K/ΔY. So K = v * ΔY.

ΔY is $70 billion, so K is 2.5 *70 = 175 billion. That's the first part.

Now, for the multiplier part, the MPC is 0.5, so the multiplier is 1/(1-0.5) = 2.

But wait, the multiplier applies to the increase in autonomous investment. So the initial increase in investment is 175 billion. The multiplier would then cause the total change in GNP to be 175 * multiplier.

Wait, but the actual change in GNP is 70 billion. So that doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the two concepts mixed up. Because the capital/output ratio approach is about how much investment is needed for a certain GNP increase, whereas the multiplier is about how an increase in investment leads to a larger increase in GNP.

So perhaps the first part uses the capital/output ratio to find that investment must increase by 175 billion to get a 70 billion increase in GNP. But then, considering the multiplier effect, the same 175 billion investment would lead to a larger GNP increase.

Wait, that can't be, because the question says the GNP rises by 70 billion, so perhaps that's the actual change, and the multiplier is applied to find the additional changes beyond that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is structured so that the initial rise in GNP is due to other factors, and the investment is being determined. Then, the multiplier is applied to that investment increase to find the further GNP changes.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to re-examine the question.

The first part asks: by how much can investment be expected to increase, assuming no depreciation, given the capital/output ratio and the GNP rise.

So that part is straightforward: 2.5 *70 = 175 billion.

Second part: "what will be the extra changes in GNP induced by the original rise?"

So the "original rise" is the GNP increase of 70 billion. But how does that induce extra changes? Or perhaps the original rise refers to the increase in investment, which is 175 billion, which then causes a multiplier effect on GNP.

Wait, but the multiplier is on the initial injection. So if the initial injection is the 175 billion investment, then the multiplier is 2, so the total increase in GNP would be 175 * 2 = 350 billion. But the actual GNP increase given is 70 billion. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

The capital/output ratio is K/ΔY =2.5. So K = 2.5ΔY. So if ΔY is 70, K is 175.

But the multiplier would be based on the MPC. So the multiplier is 1/(1-MPC)=2. So an increase in investment of 175 billion would lead to a total ΔY of 175 * 2 =350 billion. But in the question, the ΔY is given as 70 billion. So perhaps that's the confusion.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the 70 billion increase is due to the multiplier effect. Let's see.

Wait, no. Let me think differently. The first part is about how much investment is needed to cause a 70 billion increase in GNP, given the capital/output ratio of 2.5. So K=175.

Then, the second part is about the multiplier effect from that investment. So if you invest 175 billion, and the MPC is 0.5, then the total change in GNP is 175 * (1/(1-0.5))= 350 billion.

But the question says that the GNP rose by 70 billion. So perhaps the 70 billion is the actual change, and the multiplier is applied to find the additional changes beyond that? Or perhaps the question is structured differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the original rise is the 175 billion investment, which then through the multiplier leads to a 350 billion increase in GNP, making the total GNP increase 350 billion. But the question states that GNP rises by 70 billion. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the capital/output ratio to find the necessary investment for the GNP increase, and then the multiplier is applied to find how much more GNP increases beyond that due to consumption. Let's model it.

So, the initial GNP increase is 70 billion. That's due to an increase in investment of 175 billion. Now, this initial investment leads to higher income, which leads to higher consumption.

So the multiplier applies to the change in investment. The change in investment is 175 billion. So the total change in GNP would be 175 * 2 =350 billion. But wait, the GNP only rose by 70 billion. So that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial investment is 175 billion, but the capital/output ratio tells us that for each dollar of investment, GNP increases by 0.4 dollars (since 1/2.5=0.4). So 175 * 0.4 =70, which matches the given ΔY.

But then, the multiplier is on top of that. So the initial investment of 175 billion causes a 70 billion increase in GNP. But then, that 70 billion increase in GNP leads to additional consumption. So the extra changes in GNP would be due to the multiplier effect beyond the initial 70.

Wait, but how? Let's model it.

The initial investment (I) is 175 billion. This causes an increase in GNP (Y) by 70 billion. Now, that 70 billion increase in Y leads to increased consumption.

The MPC is 0.5, so the multiplier is 2. So the total change in Y due to the initial I increase would be I * multiplier. But wait, I is 175, so Y would increase by 175 * 2 = 350 billion. But in reality, Y only increased by 70 billion, so I'm confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps the 70 billion is the total change, which includes the multiplier effect. So the initial investment of 175 billion leads to a total Y increase of 350 billion. But the question says Y increased by 70, so perhaps the actual multiplier is lower.

Wait, perhaps the two approaches (capital/output ratio and multiplier) are being used in the same problem, but they're separate. So the first part is about using the capital/output ratio to find investment, and the second part is about using the multiplier to find the extra GNP changes caused by that investment.

So, the first part: ΔY =70 billion, so I = v * ΔY =2.5 *70=175.

Second part: the initial increase in I is 175 billion, which triggers a multiplier effect. The size of the multiplier is 1/(1-0.5)=2. So the total change in Y would be 175 * 2 =350 billion.

Wait, but the question says the GNP rose by 70 billion, so perhaps the 350 is the total change, but the question states that the GNP rose by 70. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is structured as two separate calculations. First, find the increase in investment needed for a 70 billion GNP rise (which is 175). Second, find out the extra GNP changes due to the multiplier from that investment increase.

So the investment increases by 175, which via the multiplier leads to an extra GNP change of (175 * 2) -175 = 175 *1=175? Because the initial 175 of investment leads to 350 of GNP, so the extra beyond the initial 175 is 175 more. But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the extra changes refer to the total multiplier effect beyond the initial change. Wait, the initial change in Y is 70. Then, due to the multiplier, the total Y change is 70 * multiplier.

Wait, that's another approach. Let's see: if the initial change is 70, and the multiplier is 2, then the total change is 140. So the extra change would be 140-70=70. But that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the initial increase in Y is 70, which comes from the investment of 175. Then, the 70 leads to more consumption. So the extra change would be 70*(1/(1-0.5) -1 )=70*(2-1)=70. So total change is 140, and extra is 70. But none of the options have 70 as the second part. The options have the second part as 350 in option D, etc.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is 175 and 350. So perhaps the second part is 350.

Wait, perhaps the first part is 175, the second is 350, so option D.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the original rise in Y is 70, but that's due to an increase in investment of 175. Then, the multiplier from that investment is 2, so the total Y increase would be 175*2=350. So the extra change would be 350-70=280? Hmm, but the option D says 175 and 350.

Wait, perhaps the question isn't considering the initial Y change but is only looking at the multiplier effect from the investment increase. So the 175 investment leads to a 350 change in Y via the multiplier. So the extra change is 350.

But the first part is 175, which is correct.

So the first blank is 175, the second is 350. Looking at the options, option D is 175 and 350, so the answer is D.

Wait, but wait. The way the question is phrased, the second part says "the extra changes in GNP induced by the original rise." The original rise is the 70 billion in GNP. So perhaps the extra changes are the multiplier effect on that 70.

So the 70 is the initial change, and the multiplier would be 2, so the extra is 70*(2-1)=70, making total 140. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the "original rise" refers to the investment increase of 175. Then, the extra changes would be 175*(2-1)=175. But that's not matching any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.

The first part is straightforward: ΔY =70, v=2.5, so I=175.

The second part: the MPC is 0.5, so multiplier is 2. The extra changes in GNP would be the result of the multiplier applied to the initial change. But initial change in what?

If the initial change is the investment of 175, then the multiplier makes GNP increase by 175*2=350. So the extra changes would be 350-175=175, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the extra changes are just the multiplied amount, which is 350, regardless of the initial 70. So the answer would be 175 and 350, which is option D.

But wait, the question says the GNP rises from 985 to 1055, which is 70. So the actual ΔY is 70. Then, with the multiplier, the induced extra change would be 70*(multiplier -1)=70*(1)=70. So total change would be 140. But that's not the case because the actual change is 70, so perhaps the multiplier isn't being applied here.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck, but looking at the options, option D has 175 and 350. So I think that's the intended answer, even if the reasoning is a bit tangled.
</think>

The question involves two parts: calculating the increase in investment based on the capital/output ratio and determining the extra changes in GNP induced by the original rise using the multiplier effect.

### Part 1: Increase in Investment
The capital/output ratio is given as 2.5, meaning $2.5 of investment is required for every $1 increase in GNP. The GNP rises from $985 billion to $1,055 billion, resulting in a $70 billion increase in GNP. Using the capital/output ratio:

\[
\text{Investment} = 2.5 \times \Delta Y = 2.5 \times 70 = 175 \, \text{billion}.
\]

Thus, the increase in investment is **$175 billion**.

### Part 2: Extra Changes in GNP Induced by the Original Rise
The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.5, so the multiplier is calculated as:

\[
\text{Multiplier} =
