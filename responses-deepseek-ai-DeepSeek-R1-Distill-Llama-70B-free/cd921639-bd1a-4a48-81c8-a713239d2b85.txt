Question:

A 25-year-old man comes to the emergency department because he developed chest pain and shortness of breath 1 hour ago, shortly after snorting cocaine for the first time. He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?

Options:

A: Nitroprusside
B: Verapamil
C: Alteplase
D: Furosemide
E: Phentolamine
F: Atorvastatin
G: Carvedilol
H: Metoprolol
I: Lisinopril
J: Warfarin

Okay, so I've got this medical question here about a 25-year-old man who presents to the ED with chest pain and shortness of breath after snorting cocaine. Hmm, I need to figure out the best next step in his treatment. Let's break down the scenario step by step.

First, the patient's symptoms started an hour ago, right after using cocaine for the first time. He's rating his chest pain a 7/10, which is pretty significant. The pain is radiating down his left arm. That makes me think of myocardial infarction (MI) because arm radiation is a classic symptom. But wait, he's only 25, so MI is uncommon at that age unless there's an underlying issue. But since he used cocaine, that could be a factor.

Looking at his vital signs: he's hypertensive with BP 200/100 mmHg. That's really high. Pulse is 110, so tachycardic. Temp is slightly elevated but not too bad. Oxygen saturation is 95% on room air, so no hypoxia. He's diaphoretic, which is another sign of something serious like a heart attack or maybe a pulmonary embolism, but his lungs are clear.

He's been treated with aspirin, nitroglycerin, and lorazepam. Aspirin is standard for MI, nitroglycerin for angina or MI, and lorazepam probably for anxiety or to help with the cocaine-induced agitation. But despite all that, he's still having chest pain and shortness of breath. His ECG shows sinus tachycardia without ST-segment or T-wave changes. So, no obvious signs of ischemia on the ECG, but that doesn't rule out an MI, especially if it's early or a non-ST elevation MI.

Cocaine use is a known risk factor for cardiovascular issues, including MI, arrhythmias, and hypertension. Cocaine causes vasoconstriction, increases heart rate, and raises blood pressure, which can lead to increased myocardial oxygen demand. This can precipitate an MI, especially in someone without a history of heart disease.

So, the initial treatment he received is appropriate, but since he's not improving, we need to consider other options. Let me look at the choices.

Option A: Nitroprusside. That's a vasodilator used in severe hypertension, especially in a hypertensive crisis. But I'm not sure if that's the immediate next step here. Plus, it's usually used when other measures fail.

Option B: Verapamil. A calcium channel blocker. It's used for certain arrhythmias and hypertension. But with cocaine, I'm not sure if that's the best choice because it can cause bradycardia and maybe worsen some conditions.

Option C: Alteplase. That's a thrombolytic, used for acute ischemic stroke or MI. But without ECG changes or evidence of an ST elevation MI, thrombolysis might not be indicated. Plus, the ECG here shows sinus tachycardia without ST changes. So maybe not yet.

Option D: Furosemide. A diuretic, used for heart failure or fluid overload. But the patient doesn't have edema or signs of pulmonary congestion; lungs are clear. So probably not the issue here.

Option E: Phentolamine. Oh, right, phentolamine is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist. It can reverse the vasoconstrictive effects of cocaine. Since cocaine causes coronary artery vasoconstriction, maybe this is a good option. Especially since the patient's BP is really high and he's not responding to nitroglycerin yet.

Option F: Atorvastatin. A statin, used for cholesterol management. While important in CAD, it's not an acute treatment, so probably not the next step.

Option G: Carvedilol. A beta-blocker with some alpha-blocking activity. Beta-blockers are used in MI to reduce workload on the heart, but cocaine can cause hypertensive crises, and beta-blockers might not be the first choice because they could cause unopposed alpha-receptor stimulation, worsening hypertension.

Option H: Metoprolol. Another beta-blocker. Same reasoning as above—probably not the best choice right now because of the risk of worsening hypertension.

Option I: Lisinopril. An ACE inhibitor, used for hypertension and heart failure. It's useful in the long term, but in acute setting with very high BP, maybe not the first choice. Also, if the patient has normal or low renal function, but nothing's indicated here.

Option J: Warfarin. An anticoagulant, used for thromboembolic events. Not indicated here unless there's a clear thrombus, which we don't have evidence of yet.

So, putting this together. The patient has cocaine-induced acute coronary syndrome, likely. His BP is extremely high, which is concerning. He's not responding to initial treatments. Phentolamine could help by blocking the alpha effects of cocaine, reducing the hypertension and coronary vasoconstriction. Alternatively, nitroglycerin is already being used, but perhaps the dose needs adjustment or another agent is needed.

Wait, but the question says he's already on IV nitroglycerin. Another approach could be to manage the hypertension more aggressively. Nitroprusside is a potent vasodilator and could lower BP, but it's typically used when other measures fail, and it requires close monitoring.

Alternatively, phentolamine is sometimes recommended in the setting of cocaine-induced hypertension or acute coronary syndrome because it can directly counteract the effects of cocaine on the vascular receptors.

So between options A (nitroprusside) and E (phentolamine). Which is more appropriate here?

I think phentolamine might be the better choice because it targets the mechanism of cocaine's action. Nitroprusside is more of a general vasodilator and might require more careful titration, but it's also effective.

Wait, looking up treatment for cocaine-induced acute coronary syndrome: the management includes aspirin, nitroglycerin, benzodiazepines for agitation, and sometimes phentolamine if there's persistent hypertension or ischemia despite initial therapy.

So in this case, since the patient's BP is 200/100 and he's still having chest pain, adding phentolamine would make sense. It's an alpha blocker that can help reduce the hypertension caused by cocaine and improve coronary blood flow.

So the answer should be E: Phentolamine.

The patient is a 25-year-old man presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath shortly after snorting cocaine. His symptoms, including radiation of pain down the left arm and diaphoresis, suggest acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Cocaine use is a known risk factor for ACS due to its vasoconstrictive and sympathomimetic effects, which increase myocardial oxygen demand and can precipitate ischemia or infarction.

The patient’s vital signs reveal severe hypertension (BP 200/100 mmHg) and tachycardia (pulse 110/min). He has been treated with aspirin, nitroglycerin, and lorazepam, but his symptoms persist. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia without ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities, which does not rule out ACS but suggests no overt ischemia at the moment.

Given the patient’s cocaine use, the primary issue is likely cocaine-induced coronary artery vasoconstriction and severe hypertension. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, is specifically recommended in this setting to counteract the vasoconstrictive effects of cocaine and reduce blood pressure. Other options, such as nitroprusside (a general vasodilator), are less targeted and typically reserved for when other measures fail. Beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol or carvedilol) are not ideal in this scenario due to the risk of unopposed alpha-receptor stimulation, which could worsen hypertension.

Thus, the most appropriate next step is to initiate phentolamine to address the cocaine-induced vasoconstriction and hypertension.
