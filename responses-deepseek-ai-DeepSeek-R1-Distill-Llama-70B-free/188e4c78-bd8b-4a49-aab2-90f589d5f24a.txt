Question:

This question refers to the following information.
At a meeting of working girls held at Hull House during a strike in a large shoe factory, the discussions made it clear that the strikers who had been most easily frightened, and therefore the first to capitulate, were naturally those girls who were paying board and were afraid of being put out if they fell too far behind. After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: "Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?" After that events moved quickly. We … discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.… At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about a passage from Jane Addams' "Twenty Years at Hull House." The question is asking which political goal the passage supports. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll read the passage carefully. It describes a meeting at Hull House during a shoe factory strike. The working girls were discussing their situation. The ones who were most easily frightened and gave in first were the ones paying board and were afraid of being evicted if they fell behind. One of them suggested starting a boarding club so they could support each other. Then, with the help of Hull House, they rented and furnished apartments, managing the club themselves. By the end of the third year, the club had grown a lot.

So the main issue here seems to be about the girls' housing insecurity and their need for mutual support to avoid eviction during tough times, like strikes. They were vulnerable because they were paying board and might lose their place if they couldn't pay. The solution they came up with was a boarding club where they could support each other, taking some of the financial pressure off.

Now, looking at the options, I need to see which political goal aligns with this. Let's go through each option:

A: Greater rights for unions - The passage is about a strike, so unions are involved, but the focus is more on the housing issue the workers faced rather than union rights specifically.

B: Increasing minimum wage - Raising wages could help, but the passage doesn't directly mention wages. It's more about housing stability.

C: Mandatory health insurance - The text doesn't talk about health issues or insurance.

D: Women's suffrage - The passage is about working women, but it's more about their economic situation than voting rights.

E: Equal pay for equal work - Again, the issue here isn't about equal pay but about housing and financial security during strikes.

F: Weakening political machines - No mention of politics or political machines in the passage.

G: Rent control laws - This seems relevant because the problem was about being able to pay rent and avoid eviction. If rents were controlled, it might help these workers afford their housing even during strikes.

H: Child labor laws - The passage doesn't talk about children working.

I: Improved working conditions in factories - The strike was about factory conditions, perhaps, but the specific solution was about housing support, not directly improving factory conditions.

J: Trust-busting - Breaking up monopolies isn't discussed here.

So the key point is that the workers were struggling with rent, leading them to form a boarding club to support each other. This suggests that rent was a significant burden. Rent control would help by limiting how much rent could increase, making it easier for them to afford even during tough times. Therefore, option G: Rent control laws seems to be the most directly supported political goal.

The passage highlights the struggle of working women during a strike, focusing on their fear of eviction due to inability to pay rent. They formed a boarding club to support each other financially. This situation points to the need for policies that address housing affordability, making rent control laws the most relevant political goal supported by the passage.

Answer: G
