Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Stadlow family going to an amusement park. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the family consists of two adults and two children. So that's 2 adults and 2 kids. Got that part. Now, the rides cost different amounts for adults and children. It says 75 cents for adults and 50 cents for children. Oh right, so each ride an adult takes is 0.75 dollars, and each child's ride is 0.50 dollars. 

Mr. Stadlow has $10. So the total money they have for rides is $10. The question is asking how many rides the family can go on in total. So I need to figure out the maximum number of rides they can take without exceeding $10.

Hmm, okay, let's think about the cost per ride for each family member. Since there are two adults and two children, maybe I should calculate the total cost for one ride each and then see how many times they can do that.

Wait, but wait, maybe each time they go on a ride, all four family members go together. So each ride would consist of two adults and two children riding, right? Or does each person go on a ride individually, meaning each ride is per person?

Wait, no, I think the way it's worded is that each ride is per person. Because it says the rides are 75 cents for adults and 50 for children. So each time an adult goes on a ride, it's 75 cents, and each child's ride is 50 cents each. So if all four go on a ride, that's two adults at 75 each and two children at 50 each.

So for one round where everyone rides once, the cost would be (2 * 0.75) + (2 * 0.50). Let me calculate that: 2 times 0.75 is 1.50, and 2 times 0.50 is 1.00. So total per round is 2.50 dollars.

Now, Mr. Stadlow has $10. So how many times can they go on a ride where everyone rides once? Let's see, 10 divided by 2.50. 2.50 times 4 is 10, right? So that would be 4 times. But wait, wait—that gives exactly 4 rides, but let me double-check. 4 rides at $2.50 each would be 4 * 2.50 = $10. So that's exactly 4 rides where each family member rides once each time. So that's 4 rides total for the family.

Wait, but the options don't have 4 as the answer. Wait, looking back at the options, yes, option F is 4 rides. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the family can mix and match. Like, perhaps sometimes only some of them ride, allowing more total rides.

Oh, right! Because maybe in some cases, they can have some family members ride more than others, possibly using the money more efficiently. So perhaps if the children ride more because their rides are cheaper, that might allow more total rides.

So let me think differently. Let's consider that each ride is per person, but each family member can go on multiple rides as long as they have enough money. So the total number of rides is the sum of all individual rides taken by the family members.

So for example, each ride an adult takes costs $0.75, and each child ride is $0.50. The total money is $10, so the sum of all rides (adult rides + child rides) should be less than or equal to $10.

Let me denote the number of rides per adult as a, and per child as c. But wait, no, because there are two adults and two children, so the total cost would be 2*(0.75*a) + 2*(0.50*c) <= 10. But that might complicate things, as a and c could vary.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as the total possible rides being the maximum number where the sum of the costs doesn't exceed $10. So each ride can be either an adult or a child ride, but the family has two adults and two children. So in each "set" of rides, each person can go once, but perhaps after that, they can go again, but I need to maximize the total number.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to calculate the maximum possible rides by considering each possible combination, but that might take longer.

Wait, let's think about the most cost-effective way. Since child rides are cheaper at 50 cents, it's better to have as many child rides as possible. But we have two adults and two children. So perhaps each ride, the two children go, and the adults go as much as possible.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that all rides have to include all family members. So perhaps we can maximize the number by having the cheaper rides (children) go more often.

Let me model the total cost equation. Let’s say:

Let x = number of times adults ride each, so each adult goes x times. So total adult rides = 2x, each costing $0.75, so cost is 2x * 0.75.

Similarly, y = number of times each child rides, so total child rides = 2y, each costing $0.50, so cost is 2y * 0.50.

Total cost is 2x*0.75 + 2y*0.50 <= 10.

Simplify that:

2x*0.75 is 1.5x, and 2y*0.50 is y.

So 1.5x + y <= 10.

We want to maximize the total number of rides, which is (2x + 2y). Because each adult goes x times, so 2x rides for adults, and each child goes y times, so 2y rides for children. So total rides = 2x + 2y = 2(x + y).

We need to maximize 2(x + y) under the constraint 1.5x + y <= 10.

Hmm, but since x and y have to be non-negative integers (you can't have a fraction of a ride), we can perhaps find the maximum x + y such that 1.5x + y <= 10.

Let me try to find possible x and y.

Let me consider x as the number of times each adult rides, and y the times each child rides.

We can try different x values and see what y can be.

x=0:
Then y <=10. So y=10. Total rides = 2(0+10)=20. But wait, that's not possible because each child can't ride 10 times each when the adults don't ride at all. Because 2y*0.5= y dollars. So if y=10, cost is 10, which is within $10. So total rides would be 2*0 (adults) + 2*10 (children) = 20 rides. But wait, the options don't have 20. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait a second, maybe I misread the problem. Let me go back. Oh, wait, the rides are 75 cents for adults and 50 cents for children. So each adult ride is 75 cents, each child ride is 50. So each time an adult goes on a ride, it's 75 cents. So for each adult, each ride is 75 cents, so if an adult goes x times, that's 0.75x per adult, so total for two adults is 1.5x. Similarly, each child goes y times, so 0.5y per child, total for two children is y. So total cost 1.5x + y <=10.

We need to maximize total rides, which is 2x (adult rides) + 2y (child rides) = 2x + 2y. So we need to maximize 2x + 2y, with 1.5x + y <=10.

Wait, but 2x + 2y = 2(x + y). So to maximize this, we need to maximize (x + y) as much as possible, given 1.5x + y <=10.

Let me solve 1.5x + y =10 for y: y=10 -1.5x.

So x + y = x + (10 -1.5x) = 10 -0.5x.

So to maximize x + y, we need to minimize 0.5x. So the smallest x possible. So x=0, then x+y=10-0=10. So maximum x+y is 10, so total rides would be 2*10=20. But again, the options don't go up that high. Hmm, that suggests I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe the problem is that each ride can only be taken once by each person. No, the problem doesn't specify that. It just says each ride costs 75 cents for adults and 50 for children. So maybe multiple rides per person are allowed.

But looking back at the options, the highest option is J:11. So 20 isn't an option, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps I misread the initial problem. Let me read it again.

"The rides at the park are 75 cents for adults and 50 cents for children. Mr. Stadlow has $10, how many rides can the family go on?"

So the family can go on rides, each ride being per person. So each time a family member goes on a ride, it costs accordingly. So the total number of rides is the sum of all individual rides taken by all family members.

Wait, but perhaps the family can't split up. Like, each ride must include all family members. But that doesn't make much sense. Usually, each person goes on a ride individually. So for example, if the family of four goes on a ride, that would be four rides (each person on the ride once). But that would cost 2*0.75 + 2*0.50 = 2.50, as I calculated earlier.

But if they can go on rides separately, perhaps some can go more than others. So maybe the maximum number of rides is achieved by having the cheaper riders (children) go as much as possible.

So let's think of it this way: each child ride costs 50 cents, so with $10, how many child rides can we have? 10 / 0.5 = 20 rides. But since there are two children, each can ride 10 times, but that would require 20 rides, costing $10. But again, that's not an option here.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Let's assume that each ride is per family, meaning all four go together each time. So each ride costs $2.50 as calculated earlier. With $10, how many such rides can they take? 10 / 2.50 = 4 rides. So 4 rides total. But the options include F:4 rides, which would be the answer if that's the case.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify that all family members must ride together each time. So perhaps they can do a mix, like some rides where only the children go, allowing more total rides.

So let's think about maximizing the number of rides by having the children ride as much as possible. Let's say the adults don't ride at all. Then, each child can ride up to 10 / 0.50 = 20 times. But since there are two children, each can ride 10 times, so total rides would be 20. But 20 isn't an option, so perhaps the problem assumes that all family members must ride together each time.

Alternatively, perhaps each ride can only be taken by one person at a time. So each ride is one person, either adult or child.

Wait, that makes more sense. So each ride is per person, so each ride is either an adult or a child. So total rides would be the sum of adult rides and child rides.

So with $10, the maximum number of rides is the maximum number of 0.75a + 0.50c <=10, where a is the number of adult rides and c is the number of child rides. And we need to maximize a + c.

But since the family has two adults and two children, the maximum number of rides any individual can take is limited only by the money, but perhaps in reality, each person can take as many as possible.

Wait, but in the problem, it's about the family going on rides. So perhaps each ride is a single person, and the family can choose which member goes on each ride. So the goal is to maximize the total number of rides, regardless of who goes on them.

So to maximize the number of rides, we should use as many child rides as possible because they're cheaper. So each child ride is 50 cents, so with $10, we can have 20 child rides. But the family only has two children. So each child can go on multiple rides, but perhaps the problem is considering each ride as a single instance, so each ride is a single person, not per family.

Wait, maybe the problem is that each ride is per person, so each time a family member goes on a ride, it's counted as one ride. So the total number of rides is the sum of all individual rides.

So to maximize the number of rides, you want as many child rides as possible.

So let's model this as: let a = number of adult rides, c = number of child rides.

Total cost: 0.75a + 0.50c <=10.

We need to maximize a + c.

We can express this as an optimization problem.

We can represent it as:

Maximize a + c,

subject to 0.75a + 0.50c <=10,

a >=0, c >=0.

We can try to find integer solutions that maximize a + c.

Let me try to express c in terms of a:

0.50c <=10 -0.75a,

c <=2*(10 -0.75a)=20 -1.5a.

So the total rides a + c <= a + (20 -1.5a)=20 -0.5a.

To maximize this, we need to minimize a, but since a can't be negative, the maximum occurs when a=0.

So when a=0, c<=20, so total rides=20. But the options don't have 20. So perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that each ride can only be taken once by each family member. Like, each family member can only go on a ride a certain number of times. But the problem doesn't specify that, so I think that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the intended approach is to assume that each ride is taken by the whole family together, so each ride costs $2.50, allowing 4 rides with $10. So the answer would be 4 rides, which is option F.

But wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A:9, B:8, C:7, D:12, E:10, F:4, G:3, H:5, I:6, J:11.

So 4 is an option, but let me see if there's a way to get more than 4 rides by having some family members ride more than others.

For example, suppose they take 3 full family rides, costing 3*2.50=$7.50. Then they have $2.50 left. With that, they can have two more child rides, costing 0.50 each, so 2*0.50=1.00, leaving $1.50, which isn't enough for another adult ride. So that would give 3 family rides (each with 4 people) and 2 child rides, totaling 3*4 +2=14 rides? No, that doesn't make sense because each family ride is 4 individual rides. So 3 family rides would be 12 individual rides (3 rides *4 people), plus 2 more child rides, making 14. But that's way higher than any option given.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the rides are counted. Maybe each time the family goes on a ride together, it's counted as one ride, not per person. But that would make the cost per ride $2.50 for the family, allowing 4 rides with $10. But that would be 4 rides in total, which is option F.

But that seems low because if the rides are counted per person, you could get more. But given the options, perhaps the intended interpretation is that each ride is per family, meaning all four go together, costing $2.50 each time. So $10 / $2.50 =4 rides, option F.

But let me think again. If each ride is per person, and the family can send any combination, then the maximum number of rides is higher. For example, using as many child rides as possible.

So let's try to maximize the number of rides with $10, using as many child rides as possible.

Each child ride is 0.50, so 20 rides would cost $10. But since there are only two children, each can ride 10 times, so total rides would be 20. But 20 isn't an option, so perhaps the problem is intended to count each family ride as one ride, meaning all four go together.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that each ride is per person, but the family can't split; they all have to ride together each time. So each ride is four people, costing 2*0.75 + 2*0.50= 2.50. So with $10, 4 rides, which is option F.

But let me check if there's a way to get more than 4 rides by having some family members ride more than others.

Wait, perhaps the adults can go on fewer rides, allowing the children to go more, thus increasing the total number of rides.

For example, suppose the adults each go on 2 rides, costing 2*2*0.75=3.00. Then the children can go on more rides with the remaining $7.

Each child ride costs 0.50, so with $7, they can have 14 child rides. But since there are two children, each can go 7 times. So total rides would be 2 adult rides (each adult goes twice, so 2 adults *2 rides=4 adult rides) plus 14 child rides, totaling 18 rides. But 18 isn't an option, so perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem is about the family going on rides, so perhaps each ride must include all family members. That would mean each ride is four people, costing $2.50, allowing 4 rides with $10. So the answer would be F:4.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows for any combination, and the maximum
