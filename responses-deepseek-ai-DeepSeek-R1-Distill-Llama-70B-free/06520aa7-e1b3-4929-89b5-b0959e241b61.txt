Question:

For the equation: 3 x − 4(x − 2) + 6 x − 8 = 0, find the value of x.

Options:

A: 0
B: -2
C: 2
D: 5
E: 1
F: 6
G: -1
H: −4
I: 4
J: 3

Answer:
    <think>


To solve the equation \(3x - 4(x - 2) + 6x - 8 = 0\), follow these steps:

1. **Expand the terms**:  
   \(3x - 4(x - 2) + 6x - 8 = 0\)  
   Distribute the \(-4\) across \((x - 2)\):  
   \(3x - 4x + 8 + 6x - 8 = 0\).

2. **Combine like terms**:  
   Combine the \(x\)-terms:  
   \(3x - 4x + 6x = 5x\).  
   Combine the constant terms:  
   \(8 - 8 = 0\).  
   So, the equation simplifies to:  
   \(5x = 0\).

3. **Solve for \(x\)**:  
   Divide both sides by 5:  
   \(x = 0\).

Thus, the value of \(x\) is **0**.

The correct answer is:

**A: 0**
