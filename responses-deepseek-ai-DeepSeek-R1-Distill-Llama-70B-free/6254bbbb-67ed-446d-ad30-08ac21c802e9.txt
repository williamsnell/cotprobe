Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the root of the equation x = 1/2 + sin(x), using the iteration method. The initial guess is x0 = 1, and the correct root is given as approximately 1.497300. The question has two parts: first, determining how many iteration steps are needed to reach the root with linear iteration, and second, how many iterations are needed if the Aitken Δ²-process is used after three approximations are available.

Hmm, I remember that the iteration method involves using a function repeatedly to approach the root. The formula given is x_{k+1} = 1/2 + sin(x_k). So, each step uses the previous x value to compute the next one.

Let me think about the first part: the number of steps for linear iteration. I think linear iteration's convergence depends on how quickly the function approaches the root. Since the correct answer is given, maybe I can simulate the iterations step by step to see when it converges to six decimal places.

Starting with x0 = 1.

Compute x1 = 1/2 + sin(1). Let me calculate that. Sin(1) is about 0.841470985. So 1/2 is 0.5, so x1 ≈ 0.5 + 0.841470985 ≈ 1.341470985.

Wait, that's x1. Now x2 is 1/2 + sin(x1). Let's compute sin(1.34147). Using a calculator, sin(1.34147) is approximately 0.977532. So x2 ≈ 0.5 + 0.977532 ≈ 1.477532.

Next, x3 is 1/2 + sin(x2). So x2 is 1.477532, sin(1.477532) is about 0.995186. So x3 ≈ 0.5 + 0.995186 ≈ 1.495186.

x4: sin(1.495186) is about sin(1.4952) ≈ 0.996912. So x4 ≈ 0.5 + 0.996912 ≈ 1.496912.

x5: sin(1.496912) ≈ let's compute that. 1.4969 radians is about 85.7 degrees. The sine is getting close to 1. Wait, let me compute it accurately. Using calculator, sin(1.496912) ≈ 0.997520. So x5 ≈ 0.5 + 0.997520 ≈ 1.497520.

x6: sin(1.49752) is almost the maximum. Let's compute: approx 0.997600. So x6 ≈ 0.5 + 0.997600 ≈ 1.497600.

Wait, the correct root is 1.497300. So let me see how each x_k compares.

x0=1.0

x1≈1.341470985

x2≈1.477532

x3≈1.495186

x4≈1.496912

x5≈1.497520

x6≈1.497600

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me compute each step more accurately.

Wait no, perhaps I should use more precise calculations. Alternatively, maybe I can use the iteration until the value stabilizes to six decimals.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute each step precisely.

Compute x0 = 1.0

Compute x1 = 0.5 + sin(1.0).

Sin(1) is approximately 0.8414709848078965.

So x1 = 0.5 + 0.8414709848078965 = 1.3414709848078965.

x2 = 0.5 + sin(x1).

Compute sin(1.3414709848078965).

Using a calculator, let me find sin(1.3414709848):

I can use an online calculator or approximate it. Let's say it's approximately 0.977532. So x2 = 0.5 + 0.977532 = 1.477532.

x3 = 0.5 + sin(1.477532).

Sin(1.477532) is about 0.995186, so x3 ≈ 0.5 + 0.995186 = 1.495186.

x4 = 0.5 + sin(1.495186).

Compute sin(1.495186) ≈ 0.996912. So x4 = 0.5 + 0.996912 = 1.496912.

x5 = 0.5 + sin(1.496912). Sin(1.496912) ≈ 0.997520. So x5 = 0.5 + 0.997520 = 1.497520.

x6 = 0.5 + sin(1.497520). Sin(1.49752) is very close to the maximum. Let's compute it accurately. Let's use a calculator: sin(1.49752) ≈ 0.99760. So x6 ≈ 1.497600.

Wait, the correct root is 1.497300. So let's see how each x_k compares to the root.

The correct root is 1.497300.

So let's compute the absolute error at each step.

x0: 1.0 → error is 0.4973.

x1: 1.3414709848 → error is about 0.1558.

x2: 1.477532 → error is 0.01977.

x3: 1.495186 → error is 0.002114.

x4: 1.496912 → error is 0.000388.

x5: 1.497520 → error is 0.000220.

x6: 1.497600 → error is 0.000300.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because x5 is 1.497520, which is 0.000220 above the root (1.497300). x6 is 1.497600, which is 0.000300 above. Wait, did I make a mistake here? Because the root is 1.497300, so x5 is 1.497520, which is 0.00022 higher. x6 is 1.497600, which is 0.00030 higher. So the error goes up a little. Hmm, maybe because the function is converging towards the root, but perhaps it's oscillating slightly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately, perhaps with more decimal places. But maybe I can approach this by considering when the difference between x_{k+1} and x_k is less than a certain tolerance. Since we need six decimal accuracy, the absolute difference between successive iterations should be less than 0.5e-6, perhaps. Alternatively, the error is less than 0.5e-6.

Wait, the stopping criterion is usually when |x_{k+1} - x_k| < ε, where ε is the tolerance. For six decimals, we can set ε = 1e-6. So let's see when the change becomes less than 1e-6.

Compute the differences:

x1 - x0: 1.3414709848 - 1.0 = 0.3414709848 → larger than 1e-6.

x2 - x1: 1.477532 - 1.3414709848 ≈ 0.136061 → larger.

x3 - x2: 1.495186 - 1.477532 ≈ 0.017654 → larger.

x4 - x3: 1.496912 - 1.495186 ≈ 0.001726 → larger.

x5 - x4: 1.497520 - 1.496912 ≈ 0.000608 → larger than 1e-6.

x6 - x5: 1.497600 - 1.497520 ≈ 0.000080 → which is 8e-5, still larger than 1e-6.

Wait, so the difference is 8e-5, which is 0.00008. Hmm, perhaps I need to compute more steps to see when the difference becomes less than 1e-6.

Wait, but let me compute x7.

x6 is 1.497600.

Compute x7 = 0.5 + sin(x6) → sin(1.497600) ≈ ?

Let me compute sin(1.4976):

I think the maximum of sin(x) is 1, and the root is where x = 0.5 + sin(x). So the root is where sin(x) = x - 0.5.

Wait, but let's compute sin(1.4976) accurately.

Using a calculator: 1.4976 radians is approximately 85.8 degrees. The sine of 1.4976 is approximately 0.997600 (but perhaps a bit more precise).

Wait, perhaps using a Taylor series expansion around the root to approximate sin(x) near x=1.4973.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator to find sin(1.4976):

Let me compute it accurately. Let's say using a calculator, sin(1.4976) ≈ 0.997600. Wait, but let me be precise. Maybe using more accurate computation:

Using an online calculator, sin(1.4976) ≈ approximately 0.997600. So x7 = 0.5 + 0.997600 = 1.497600. Hmm, same as x6. So the difference x7 - x6 is zero, which is less than 1e-6. Wait, but that can't be right because x6 and x7 would be the same. So perhaps after x6, the iteration has converged. But wait, x5 was 1.497520, x6 is 1.497600, x7 would then be 0.5 + sin(1.4976) = 0.5 + 0.997600 = 1.497600, same as x6.

Wait, that's confusing. So perhaps the iteration stops at x6 because the change is 8e-5, which is larger than 1e-6. So I need to compute x7, which is same as x6, so the difference is zero. So maybe after x7, the change is zero, which is within the tolerance. So that would take 7 iterations to reach x7.

Wait, but let me recount the steps.

x0 is 1.

x1 is 1.3414709848 (step 1)

x2 is 1.477532 (step 2)

x3 is 1.495186 (step3)

x4 is 1.496912 (step4)

x5 is 1.497520 (step5)

x6 is 1.497600 (step6)

x7 is 1.497600 (step7)

So, the change from x6 to x7 is zero, which is within 1e-6. So the iteration stops at step7. So that's seven iterations. But wait, let me check: when we compute x7, it's the same as x6, so the difference is zero, which meets the condition. So the number of steps is 7, which would correspond to option I (7).

Wait, but the correct answer is given as x=1.497300. So perhaps my manual calculation is not precise enough. Maybe I should compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each x with more decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps the iteration converges, and the number of steps required is 7. So the first part's answer is 7 steps.

Now, the second part: using the Aitken Δ² process after three approximations are available. How many iterations are needed?

Aitken's method is an extrapolation technique to accelerate the convergence of a sequence. The formula is:

x_{k+1} = x_k - ( (x_k - x_{k-1}) * (x_k - x_{k-2}) ) / ( (x_k - x_{k-1}) - (x_{k-1} - x_{k-2}) ) )

So, to apply Aitken's method, we need three consecutive approximations, say x0, x1, x2. Then, compute the accelerated value, which is supposed to be closer to the root. Then, the next iteration uses the last two points.

Wait, but in the question, it says after three approximations are available. So probably, after computing x0, x1, x2, we can apply Aitken's method once. Then, the next step would be to compute x3 using the iteration method, and then apply Aitken again, perhaps.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how the Aitken process works in this context. Let me think again.

The Aitken Δ² process is usually applied to a sequence to get a better approximation. So, for example, after having x0, x1, x2, we can compute an extrapolated value x2' using Aitken's formula. Then, in the next iteration, the sequence would be x1, x2, x2', and so on. Each time, the Aitken step reduces the number of iterations needed.

But in this problem, the question is: if the Aitken Δ²-process is used after three approximations are available, how many iterations are required?

Wait, perhaps the question is asking, considering that we apply Aitken's method after having three initial approximations (x0, x1, x2), how many more steps does it take? Or perhaps it's asking how many total iterations are needed when using Aitken's method from the start.

Wait, the problem says: "after three approximations are available, how many iterations are required?" So perhaps, after three steps (x0, x1, x2), we apply Aitken once, and then see how many more steps are needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to use the Aitken acceleration each time after three terms, so we compute the first three terms, then compute the Aitken estimate, and then proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps each Aitken step counts as an iteration. So, for example, each time we apply Aitken, it's considered as an iteration step.

But I'm a bit unsure about this part. Let me try to outline the steps.

First, without Aitken:

We have to compute x0, x1, x2, ..., until we reach the root within six decimals. As I thought earlier, that took seven iterations.

With Aitken, perhaps after computing x0, x1, x2, we can compute an extrapolated value, say x2', which is better than x2. Then, use x1, x2, x2' to compute another extrapolated value, x3', and so on.

Wait, but I'm not sure if each Aitken step counts as an iteration. Alternatively, perhaps each Aitken step uses the previous three terms and produces a new term, which counts as an iteration.

Wait, perhaps the process is: after having three terms, apply Aitken once to get a new term, then after that, each new term uses the last three, including the Aitken term.

So, let's see:

Compute x0 =1,

x1 =0.5 + sin(x0) = 1.3414709848,

x2 =0.5 + sin(x1) ≈1.477532.

Now, apply Aitken to x0, x1, x2.

The Aitken formula is:

x2' = x2 - ( (x2 - x1)*(x2 - x0) ) / ( (x2 - x1) - (x1 - x0) )

Compute the numerator: (x2 -x1)(x2 -x0) = (1.477532 -1.3414709848)*(1.477532 -1) = (0.1360610152)*(0.477532) ≈ 0.06495.

Denominator: (x2 -x1) - (x1 -x0) = (0.1360610152) - (0.3414709848) = -0.2054099696.

So x2' = x2 - (0.06495)/(-0.20541) ≈ 1.477532 + (0.06495 / 0.20541) ≈ 1.477532 + 0.3158 ≈ 1.7933. Wait, that can't be right because the root is around 1.4973. So applying Aitken once seems to take us further away. Hmm, that can't be correct. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck.

The Aitken formula is: 

x_{n+1} = x_n - [ (x_n - x_{n-1})(x_n - x_{n-2}) ) / ( (x_n - x_{n-1}) - (x_{n-1} - x_{n-2}) ) ]

So substituting the values:

x_n = x2 = 1.477532,

x_{n-1} = x1 = 1.3414709848,

x_{n-2} = x0 = 1.

So,

delta1 = x_n - x_{n-1} = 1.477532 -1.3414709848 ≈ 0.1360610152,

delta2 = x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} = 1.3414709848 -1 = 0.3414709848.

So numerator is delta1 * (x_n - x_{n-2}) ) = delta1 * (x2 -x0) = 0.1360610152 * (1.477532 -1) = 0.1360610152 * 0.477532 ≈ 0.06495.

Denominator is delta1 - delta2 = 0.1360610152 - 0.3414709848 ≈ -0.20541.

So the term to subtract is (0.06495)/(-0.20541) ≈ -0.3158.

So x2' = x2 - ( -0.3158 ) = x2 + 0.3158 ≈ 1.477532 + 0.3158 ≈ 1.793332. That's way off the root. That's strange. Perhaps I applied the formula incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula as:

x_{k+1} = x_k - [ (x_k - x_{k-1}) * (x_k - x_{k-2}) ) / ( (x_k - x_{k-1}) - (x_{k-1} - x_{k-2}) ) ]

So let me plug in the numbers again:
