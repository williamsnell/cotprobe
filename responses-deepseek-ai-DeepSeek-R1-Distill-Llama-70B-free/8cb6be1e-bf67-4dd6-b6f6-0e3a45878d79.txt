Question:

Carol Collector was a serious antique car buyer, and was always searching for Thunderbirds in good shape. She saw a newspaper ad offering a 1964 Thunderbird sports coupe for $25,000, The ad also gave a website address "to view a picture of the car," which Carol visited, and which showed a T-Bird with a perfect body and interior. Carol paid the $25,000 and signed a sales contract which specified that the Thunderbird was "used and sold as is." When Carol went to pick up the car, she learned it was a 1968 model, which was not at all rare and worth much less than the advertised 1964 model. If Carol brings suit against the seller, the likely outcome is for

Options:

A: Carol, because the internet picture was of a car that had never been driven, not the actual used car she was to buy.
B: Carol, because the seller was not negligent in providing a picture of the car.
C: Carol, because the "as is" disclosure was not totally effective.
D: The seller, unless they can prove Carol had knowledge that the car was a 1968 model.
E: The seller, because the car was misrepresented in the advertisement.
F: The seller, because the buyer was aware the Thunderbird was sold "as is."
G: Carol, unless the seller can prove the 1968 model was of equal value to the 1964 model.
H: The seller, unless they were negligent in not explicitly stating the picture was of a new car, not the actual car to be sold.
I: The seller, if Carol can prove she relied on the picture when making her purchase.
J: Carol, because the seller provided a picture of the car, regardless of its condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about Carol Collector and the Thunderbird car she bought. Let me break it down.

Carol saw an ad for a 1964 Thunderbird sports coupe for $25k. The ad had a website with a picture showing a perfect body and interior. She paid and signed a contract that said the car was "used and sold as is." But when she picked it up, it was a 1968 model, which isn't rare and is worth less. Now she's suing the seller.

Hmm, the question is about whether the court would rule in favor of Carol or the seller. I remember that "as is" sales usually mean the buyer takes the risk, but there are exceptions if there's fraud or misrepresentation.

Wait, the ad said it was a 1964 model, but it turned out to be 1968. That's a misrepresentation. Even though the contract says "as is," I think if the seller lied about the car's model, that's fraud. So the "as is" clause might not protect the seller if they made a false statement.

Looking at the options:

Option A says Carol wins because the picture was of an undriven car. But the issue isn't the condition; it's the model year. So A might not be right.

Option E says the seller loses because the ad misrepresented the car. That sounds correct because the seller advertised a 1964 but sold a 1968.

Option F says seller wins because "as is." But if there was fraud, "as is" doesn't cover that. So F might not apply.

Option G says Carol wins unless the seller proves equal value. But the question states the 1968 is worth less, so maybe that's relevant, but I'm not sure if that's the main point.

Option C says Carol wins because "as is" wasn't effective. I think "as is" can be overcome with fraud. So maybe C is a contender, but the main issue is the misrepresentation, so E seems more direct.

Option I says seller loses if Carol relied on the picture. But the picture probably showed a 1964, but the actual car was 1968. So she relied on the ad's description, not just the picture. So I is part of it, but E is broader.

So I think the correct answer is E: The seller, because the car was misrepresented in the advertisement.

The correct answer is E. The seller loses because the advertisement misrepresented the car as a 1964 model when it was actually a 1968 model. This constitutes fraud, which overrides the "as is" clause.
