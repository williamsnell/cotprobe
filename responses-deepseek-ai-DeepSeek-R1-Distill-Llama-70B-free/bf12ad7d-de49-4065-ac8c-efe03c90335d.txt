Question:

A tenant lived in a small apartment building that was owned by a landlord. In July, the landlord was killed in an accident. In August, the tenant brought an action against the administrator of the landlord's state. The tenant alleged that he and the landlord had a contract under the terms of which the landlord was supposed to pay him $50 a week to mow the lawn and perform small maintenance repairs for the other tenants. He claimed that the landlord had not paid him for the past six months. He testified that there was a written contract and that the landlord kept the only copy of it in his home. At trial, he called the landlord's accountant to testify about the contract. The accountant testified that she had seen the contract. She further testified about the terms of the contract, consistent with the tenant's testimony. She testified that the contract, along with many other documents pertaining to the landlord's business, had most likely been destroyed when the landlord's business office was robbed a few months earlier. The trial judge should rule that the accountant's. testimony is

Options:

A: admissible as a written admission by the party opponent.
B: admissible, because it corroborates the tenant's claims.
C: inadmissible, because the accountant's testimony is not the best evidence.
D: inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute.
E: admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances.
F: inadmissible, because the accountant is an interested party.
G: admissible, because it falls under the business record exception.
H: inadmissible, because it constitutes hearsay evidence.
I: inadmissible, due to the lack of physical contract as evidence.
J: admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through it step by step. 

The scenario is that a tenant is suing the administrator of his landlord's estate. The tenant claims there was a contract where the landlord agreed to pay him $50 a week for mowing the lawn and doing small repairs. He says the landlord didn't pay him for six months. He testified that there was a written contract, but the landlord kept the only copy, which was probably destroyed when the office was robbed.

At the trial, the tenant called the landlord's accountant to testify. The accountant said she saw the contract and described terms consistent with the tenant's testimony. She also said the contract was likely destroyed in a robbery along with other documents.

So the question is about the admissibility of the accountant's testimony. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

First, I need to consider the rules of evidence here. The main issue is whether the accountant's testimony about the contents of the contract is admissible.

The tenant is trying to prove the existence and terms of a written contract. Normally, when a written document is involved, the best evidence rule (FRE 1002) requires the original document to be produced unless reasons are given why it's unavailable. But here, the contract was destroyed in a robbery, so that's a good reason. The best evidence rule could be satisfied through secondary evidence if the original is lost or destroyed.

But wait, the tenant didn't produce the contract, so he's using the accountant's testimony about what the contract said. So the question is whether that testimony is admissible as secondary evidence.

Alternatively, the accountant's testimony might be hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. If the accountant is recounting what the contract said, that's based on her memory of the document, not her own knowledge. But wait, she saw the contract, so she's testifying about a document she observed. So she's not relying on an out-of-court statement; she's recounting her own perception. So that shouldn't be hearsay.

Wait, no. The contract is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the terms. So when the accountant testifies about the terms, that's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Wait, but the contract is a written statement, so the accountant's testimony about its contents is hearsay. Unless there's an exception. What exceptions apply?

One possible exception is the business records exception under FRE 803(6). If the accountant kept the contract as part of the landlord's business records, and if she can attest to the regular practice of keeping such records, then the contents could be admissible as a business record.

Alternatively, the contract's destruction might allow for secondary evidence. So under FRE 1004, if the original is lost or destroyed, a copy or other secondary evidence can be used. But the tenant doesn't have a copy, so the accountant's testimony about the contents would be secondary evidence.

Wait, but the best evidence rule applies when the contents of a writing are in issue. So if the contract's terms are disputed, the original is preferred, but if it's unavailable, secondary evidence is allowed. So the accountant's testimony about what she remembers the contract said would be secondary evidence under FRE 1004.

So looking at the options:

Option E says it's admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances. That seems possible.

Option C says it's inadmissible because it's not the best evidence. But the best evidence rule allows secondary evidence when the original is unavailable, so C is not correct.

Option G suggests it's admissible under the business records exception. Well, the accountant's testimony about the contract's terms might be based on the business records. If the contract was part of the business records, and she can testify about it, then yes, maybe G applies.

But wait, the business records exception requires that the record be made at or near the time by someone with knowledge, and kept in the regular course of business. If the contract was a business record, then the accountant's testimony about its contents would fall under that exception, making it admissible.

So which is it? Is the testimony admissible under the business records exception (G) or as secondary evidence due to unavailability (E)?

Alternatively, if the contract's contents are in question, and the original is gone, then the best evidence rule would allow the accountant's testimony as secondary evidence. Or is it better suited under the business records exception?

Wait, the best evidence rule would require that when the content of a writing is in issue, the original be produced unless it's unavailable. Since it's unavailable, secondary evidence is allowed. So the testimony is admissible as secondary evidence under FRE 1004.

So option E would be correct.

But wait, another angle: the contract is between the tenant and the landlord. The accountant's knowledge of the contract is based on her role in the business. So under the business records exception, the contract would be a business record, so her testimony about it would be admissible.

So which exception applies here? Both E and G could be possible.

Looking back, the question is about the admissibility of the accountant's testimony. If the testimony is about the contract's terms, and the contract was a business record, then G would allow it. But if the issue is that the original is lost, then E applies.

Wait, but the best evidence rule is about the form of evidence (original vs. copy), not whether the evidence is admissible at all. So if the original isn't available, you can use secondary evidence, but that doesn't make the evidence inadmissible as hearsay. So the hearsay issue is separate.

So the accountant's testimony about the contract's terms would be hearsay unless an exception applies. So it's an out-of-court statement (the contract) being offered for the truth (that the landlord agreed to pay $50/week). So that's hearsay. Unless it's a business record.

Wait, the contract itself is a written statement, so the content of the contract is hearsay. But under FRE 803(6), business records are an exception. So if the contract was kept as part of the landlord's business records, then the accountant's testimony about the contract's terms would be admissible under the business records exception.

So the testimony would be admissible under G: admissible under the business record exception.

Wait, but the contract was between the tenant and landlord. Is that a business record of the landlord's business? If the landlord was operating a business (like renting apartments), then contracts with tenants or service providers would be part of the business records. So yes, the contract would be a business record.

Therefore, the accountant's testimony about the contract's terms would be admissible as a business record exception, making option G correct.

But wait, another angle: the contract was destroyed, so she can't produce it, but she's testifying from her memory. Does that affect anything? If the business records are destroyed, but she remembers the content, would her testimony still fall under the business records exception? Or does the exception require the record to be produced unless it's unavailable?

Wait, no. The business records exception allows the content of the record to be testified to by someone familiar with the records, even without producing the document. So the destruction of the document doesn't affect the admissibility under the business records exception, as long as the other requirements are met (like regular practice of keeping records, etc.).

So in this case, the accountant can testify about the contract's terms under the business records exception. So option G is correct.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option E says it's admissible as secondary evidence under the circumstances. That would be if the original is unavailable, so secondary evidence is allowed. But secondary evidence is about the form, not hearsay. So the hearsay issue is separate.

So, the testimony is hearsay, but it's covered by the business records exception. So the correct reason is G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the contract was destroyed, making the original unavailable, so the best evidence rule allows secondary evidence, making the testimony admissible. So that's E. But then, is there a hearsay problem? Because the testimony is about the contents of the contract, which is an out-of-court statement. So it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

So which exception? Either the business records exception or the rule about secondary evidence.

Wait, the best evidence rule is about the form, not the hearsay. So even if the testimony is allowed as secondary evidence, we still need to address whether it's hearsay.

So the accountant's testimony about the contract's terms is hearsay. So unless it's exempt, it's inadmissible.

So the options would need to address both the best evidence and hearsay.

Looking back, option E says it's admissible as secondary evidence. That handles the best evidence issue but doesn't address hearsay. So the testimony would still be inadmissible as hearsay unless an exception applies.

So the correct answer would need to address both. So if the testimony is allowed under a hearsay exception, like business records, then G would be correct. If it's allowed under the best evidence via secondary evidence, but still inadmissible as hearsay, then E isn't enough.

So in this case, the key is that the testimony is hearsay, but falls under the business records exception. So the correct answer is G.

Wait, but the business records exception applies when the record is made in the regular course of business. The contract was part of the landlord's business, so it's a business record. Therefore, the accountant's testimony is admissible under G.

So the answer should be G.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the accountant's testimony regarding the terms of a written contract between the tenant and the landlord. The tenant alleges that the landlord failed to pay him $50 a week for mowing the lawn and performing small maintenance repairs, as per their contract. The landlord's accountant testified that she saw the contract, described its terms consistent with the tenant's claims, and explained that the contract was likely destroyed in a robbery along with other business documents. The issue is whether the accountant's testimony is admissible.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Best Evidence Rule (FRE 1002)**: The best evidence rule requires the original document to be produced when the contents of a writing are in issue. However, under FRE 1004, secondary evidence (such as testimony about the contents of a document) is admissible if the original is unavailable due to loss or destruction. Here, the contract was destroyed in a robbery, making secondary evidence admissible under the circumstances.

2. **Hearsay Consideration**: The accountant's testimony about the contract's terms constitutes hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (the terms of the contract). However, hearsay can be admissible if an exception applies.

3. **Business Records Exception (FRE 803(6))**: The contract was part of the landlord's business records, as it pertained to the landlord's business operations (managing the apartment building and hiring someone to perform maintenance). The accountant, familiar with the landlord's business records, testified about the contract's terms. This makes the testimony admissible under the business records exception, as the contract was created and maintained in the regular course of business.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The testimony is not a written admission by a party opponent.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. While the testimony corroborates the tenant's claims, this does not address the hearsay or best evidence issues.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The testimony is not inadmissible for failing to meet the best evidence rule, as secondary evidence is allowed when the original is unavailable.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The Dead Man's Statute does not apply here, as the landlord's death does not bar the tenant's claim.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. While secondary evidence is admissible under the circumstances, this option does not address the hearsay issue.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. There is no indication that the accountant is an interested party.
   - **Option G**: Correct. The testimony is admissible under the business records exception, as the contract was a business record, and the accountant testified about its contents.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. While the testimony is hearsay, it is admissible under the business records exception.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The lack of the physical contract does not render the testimony inadmissible, as secondary evidence is allowed.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. While the testimony falls under an exception to the hearsay rule, the specific exception is the business records exception, making Option G the better answer.

### Conclusion:
The accountant's testimony is admissible under the business records exception, as the contract was part of the landlord's business records, and the accountant testified about its contents. This makes **Option G** the correct answer.
