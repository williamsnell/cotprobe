Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about auditing when there's a change in accounting principles. Let's see what it's asking. The question is about what the auditor should do when the change affects comparability but the effect isn't material. Hmm.

I remember from my studies that when accounting principles change, it can impact the financial statements. The key here is that the effect isn't material. So, the auditor doesn't need to issue a qualified or adverse opinion because those are for more serious issues.

Wait, I think there's something about how the auditor's report handles such changes. If it's not material, maybe they don't need to change their opinion. But they still have to mention it somehow, right? Or maybe they just don't mention it at all?

I recall that in the audit report, if there's a change in accounting principles that's accounted for appropriately, the auditor might refer to the note that explains the change. But only if the effect is material. Oh wait, no, the question says the effect isn't material. So maybe the auditor doesn't need to refer to it in the report.

Wait, another thought. The auditor's responsibility is to report on whether the financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. If the change in principle is in accordance with GAAP but the effect is immaterial, the auditor might still need to mention it, but perhaps in a way that doesn't affect the opinion.

I think the correct approach is that when the effect isn't material, the auditor doesn't need to modify their opinion. So they would issue an unqualified opinion. But the question is about what action the auditor should take regarding the change.

Looking at the options: Option H says "Not refer to the change in the auditor’s report." That makes sense if the effect isn't material. Because if it's material, the auditor would have to refer to it, possibly in an emphasis-of-matter paragraph or qualified opinion. But since it's not, maybe they don't have to mention it.

Wait, but what about the note in the financial statements? If the client has disclosed the change in a note, does the auditor have to refer to that note? I think when a change has a material effect, the auditor refers to the note. But if it's not material, maybe the note is still there, but the auditor doesn't need to mention it in their report.

So, in this case, since the effect isn't material, the auditor's report doesn't need to refer to the change. So the correct answer would be H: Not refer to the change in the auditor’s report.

Alternatively, another option is B: Refer to the note in the financial statements that discusses the change. But I think that's only when the effect is material. So if the effect isn't material, the auditor doesn't need to refer to it.

Yeah, I'm pretty sure H is the correct answer here.

When there is a change in accounting principles that does not materially affect the comparability of the financial statements, the auditor is not required to refer to the change in the auditor’s report. The auditor’s primary responsibility is to ensure the financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with the applicable framework. Since the effect of the change is immaterial, the auditor can issue an unqualified opinion without drawing attention to the change in the report. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H: Not refer to the change in the auditor’s report.

Answer: H
