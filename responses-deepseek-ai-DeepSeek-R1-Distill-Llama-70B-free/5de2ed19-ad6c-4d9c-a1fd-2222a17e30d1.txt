The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests. It could only be accomplished by exploiting the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside the lands of the society making the jump. Western Europe did just that by means of its brutality and guns and, more important, by geographical and ecological luck."

Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question. Let me read the question carefully and understand what's being asked.

The question is about a passage from Alfred Crosby's "Ecological Imperialism." The author talks about a "quantum jump" in productivity that a society must achieve to gain global hegemony. This jump must happen before the various revolutions (scientific, technological, agricultural, industrial) that underpin the modern world. The author says this was accomplished by exploiting ecosystems, minerals, and human assets from other continents, using Western Europe as an example, which did so through brutality, guns, and geographical luck.

So the question is asking which option best supports the author's assertion regarding this quantum jump that helped Western Europe achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.

The options are A through J, each presenting a historical event or process.

I need to think about what a "quantum jump" implies. It's a significant increase in productivity, likely through exploiting resources from other regions. So the options should relate to Western Europe exploiting resources outside of Europe during that time period.

Looking at the options:

A: Discovery and colonization of Australia. But Australia was colonized later, I think in the late 18th century, after 1750. So maybe not relevant for the period in question.

B: Cultural exchange with Native American tribes. That doesn't sound like exploitation for productivity; it's more about exchange, which might not support the idea of a quantum jump through exploitation.

C: Development of a centralized government in Europe. That's about internal political structure, not exploiting external resources.

D: Reformation of Catholic Christianity. That's a religious movement, not directly related to resource exploitation or productivity jump.

E: Conquest of the Aztec Empire. The Aztecs were in Central America, and the Spanish conquest happened in the early 16th century, which is within the 1450-1750 timeframe. This conquest led to the exploitation of gold, silver, and other resources, which would definitely contribute to a quantum jump in productivity and wealth for Western Europe, especially Spain.

F: Industrial revolution in Britain. The Industrial Revolution started in the late 18th century, after the 1750 cutoff mentioned in the question. So it's outside the period.

G: Isolationism of Tokugawa Japan. That's about Japan's policy, not Western Europe's actions.

H: Colonization of the interior of Africa. I think during this period, Europeans were more involved in coastal trade and colonies rather than the interior. Also, the exploitation of Africa's interior happened more in the 19th century.

I: Construction of the Great Wall of China. That's a Chinese project and doesn't relate to Europe's actions.

J: Establishment of trade routes with China. While trade with China (like the Silk Road or maritime routes) existed, the author is talking about exploiting resources through colonization, which would be more about taking over lands and extracting resources rather than just trade.

So the best option is E: The conquest of the Aztec Empire. It fits the timeframe and involves exploiting resources from outside Europe, which aligns with the author's assertion about the quantum jump through exploitation.

The author's assertion focuses on how Western Europe achieved a "quantum jump" in productivity by exploiting resources from other continents. The conquest of the Aztec Empire, which occurred in the early 16th century, exemplifies this process. It involved the exploitation of gold, silver, and other resources, directly contributing to Western Europe's wealth and productivity during the specified period.

Answer: E
