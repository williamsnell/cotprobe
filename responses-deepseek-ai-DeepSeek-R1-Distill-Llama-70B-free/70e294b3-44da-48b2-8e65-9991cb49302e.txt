Okay, so I've got this question about tariffs and quotas. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what I remember from my economics class.

Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, right? So when a country imposes a tariff, it makes imported goods more expensive. That probably means domestic prices go up because people might buy more domestic products since imports are pricier. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? No, wait, I think higher tariffs mean imported goods are more expensive, so domestic producers can charge more because there's less competition. So prices go up.

Quotas are limits on the quantity of goods that can be imported. So if a country sets a quota, they're restricting the amount of a certain good coming in. This would reduce supply in the domestic market. When supply goes down and demand stays the same, prices should rise. So both tariffs and quotas make domestic prices higher.

Let me look at the options. The question is about what tariffs and quotas do.

Option A says the former lowers prices, which doesn't fit because tariffs raise them. So A is wrong.

Option B says they reduce overall costs for consumers. No, because both make things more expensive. So B is wrong.

Option C says no impact on trade volume. That's not right because both tariffs and quotas can reduce imports, so they affect trade. So C is wrong.

Option D says result in higher domestic prices. That matches what I was thinking. Both cause prices to go up. So D might be the right answer.

Option E talks about stability without influencing domestic markets. No, because they definitely influence domestic markets by raising prices. So E is wrong.

Option F says lower prices due to competition. No, higher prices because of less competition. So F is wrong.

Option G says the former (tariff) raises prices and the latter (quota) lowers them. Wait, no, both raise prices. So G is incorrect.

Option H says they promote trade. Actually, they restrict trade, so H is wrong.

Option I is about environmental standards. That's not the primary use of tariffs and quotas. They're usually for protecting domestic industries. So I is wrong.

Option J says they don't affect prices. No, they do, as both raise prices. So J is wrong.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: result in higher domestic prices.

The correct answer is D.

D: result in higher domestic prices.

Because both tariffs and quotas increase domestic prices by making imports more expensive and reducing competition.
