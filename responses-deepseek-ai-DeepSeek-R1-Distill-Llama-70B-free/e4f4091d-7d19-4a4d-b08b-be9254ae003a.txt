Question:

It was raining hard one evening as a cab driver was looking for one last passenger. A passenger flagged him down and directed him to take her home. The cab driver recognized the passenger as a former girlfriend, and the passenger invited him into her house when they arrived. Unknown to the cab driver, the passenger was an undercover police officer who worked in the sex crimes unit. When they were inside the passenger's house, the cab driver made sexual advances toward the passenger, who responded by kissing him and holding his hand. The cab driver was about to kiss the passenger again, when she got up to answer the phone in the kitchen. If the cab driver is subsequently arrested and charged with the attempted rape of the passenger, he should be found

Options:

A: not guilty, if he was predisposed to commit thecrime.
B: guilty, if he continued his advances after she got up.
C: not guilty.
D: guilty, based on the passenger's account.
E: not guilty, if he raises the proper alibi defense.
F: guilty, if his advances were unwelcome.
G: not guilty, if he can prove his intentions were not malicious.
H: guilty, if the passenger felt threatened.
I: not guilty, solely because he was entrapped.
J: not guilty, if he did not use force or threats.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question here. Let's break it down step by step. The question is about criminal law, specifically regarding attempted rape charges. Hmm.

Alright, the scenario is a cab driver who picks up a passenger, who turns out to be an undercover police officer. They went to her house, and inside, the cab driver made sexual advances. She responded by kissing him and holding his hand. Then, when she got up to answer the phone, he was about to kiss her again. Now, he's charged with attempted rape.

The question is whether he should be found guilty or not guilty, and the options are A through J.

First, I need to understand the elements of attempted rape. Attempted rape is a specific intent crime, meaning the defendant must have intended to commit rape. Rape, in many jurisdictions, involves non-consensual sexual intercourse through force, threat of force, or fraud. So, for attempted rape, the defendant must have taken a substantial step toward committing rape with the specific intent to do so.

In this case, the cab driver made advances, which she responded to by kissing and holding hands. Then she got up, and he was about to kiss her again. Wait, but she's an undercover officer. So, maybe she's trying to get evidence against him. But the key point is whether he intended to commit rape, and whether his actions constituted a substantial step towards that.

Wait, but she kissed him and held his hand. That suggests mutual consent. Unless she was pretending to consent as part of her undercover operation. But from the cab driver's perspective, he thought she was consenting. Does that matter for his intent?

Wait, in terms of criminal law, for specific intent crimes like attempt, the defendant's belief about the situation is crucial. So if he believed she was consenting, then he wouldn't have the intent to commit rape because he thought the sexual activity was consensual.

So, for attempted rape, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to commit rape. If the cab driver thought she was consenting, he can't have the intent to rape her because he didn't think he was acting without her consent.

But wait, there's the concept of legal impossibility in criminal attempts. Legal impossibility occurs when the defendant's actions, even if completed, wouldn't constitute a crime because what they intended to do wasn't illegal. However, in this case, if the officer was pretending to consent, but in reality, any sexual act without her actual consent would be rape. But the driver thought she was consenting, so he didn't intend to rape her.

So, the key issue is whether the cab driver had the specific intent to commit rape. If he believed she was consenting, then he didn't have that intent. Therefore, he couldn't be guilty of attempted rape because he lacked the specific intent.

Looking at the options:

Option C says "not guilty." That would be correct if the driver lacked the specific intent because he thought she consented.

Option A says "not guilty, if he was predisposed to commit the crime." Hmm, predisposed is more about entrapment, maybe. But the question isn't about entrapment; it's about whether he had the intent.

Option I says "not guilty solely because he was entrapped." Entrapment is when the government induces someone to commit a crime they wouldn't have otherwise. But here, the passenger was an undercover officer. However, the driver initiated the advances, so it's not clear if entrapment applies. Plus, entrapment is an affirmative defense, and the question doesn't specify that he's raising that defense.

Option F says "guilty, if his advances were unwelcome." But if the officer was kissing and holding hands, it might seem welcome. Unless she was pretending, but from his perspective, he thought it was welcome.

Wait, but the officer's actual feelings don't matter for the driver's intent. What matters is what the driver believed. So if he thought she was consenting, he didn't have the intent to rape.

So, based on that, the correct answer is C: not guilty.

Wait, but another angle: If the cab driver made advances, and she responded by kissing, etc., but then when she got up, he tried to kiss her again. Maybe that's where the issue is. Did he continue after she stopped consenting? But in the fact pattern, she got up to answer the phone, and he was about to kiss her again. It doesn't say she withdrew consent, just that she got up. So maybe she was still consenting, or maybe she wasn't.

But the key point is that the driver's intent was based on her responses. If she was kissing him, he had no reason to think she wasn't consenting. So he didn't have the intent to rape.

So the answer should be C: not guilty.

The question revolves around whether the cab driver can be found guilty of attempted rape. Attempted rape is a specific intent crime, requiring the defendant to have the intent to commit rape and to take a substantial step toward that goal. Rape typically involves non-consensual sexual intercourse through force, threat, or fraud. 

In this scenario, the cab driver made sexual advances, which the undercover officer responded to by kissing and holding hands. From the cab driver's perspective, these actions indicated consent. For specific intent crimes like attempted rape, the defendant's belief about the situation is crucial. If the cab driver believed the officer was consenting, he lacked the intent to commit rape, as he did not believe he was acting without her consent.

The key issue is whether the cab driver had the specific intent to commit rape. Since he reasonably believed the officer was consenting based on her actions, he did not have the requisite intent. Therefore, he should not be found guilty of attempted rape.

Option C, "not guilty," is the correct answer because the cab driver lacked the specific intent to commit rape due to his belief that the officer was consenting.

Answer: C
