Okay, so I've got this question about atoms and their electron levels. The question is: "An atom has filled n = 1 and n = 2 levels. How many electrons does the atom have?" And there are ten options to choose from, labeled A to J.

Hmm, I remember that in atoms, electrons are organized into different energy levels or shells, right? Each shell has a specific capacity for how many electrons it can hold. I think the first shell, n=1, can hold 2 electrons. Oh wait, yeah, the formula for the maximum number of electrons in a shell is 2n². So for n=1, it's 2*(1)^2 = 2 electrons. That makes sense because the first shell is the smallest and can only have two electrons.

Then the second shell, n=2. Using the same formula, 2*(2)^2 = 8 electrons. Wait, no, wait. I'm a bit confused here. Because I thought each shell n can hold up to 2n² electrons. So for n=2, that's 2*(2)^2 = 8. So the second shell holds 8 electrons maximum.

So if the atom has completely filled n=1 and n=2, that means it has all the electrons possible in those two shells. So I just need to add the electrons from each shell. So 2 (from n=1) plus 8 (from n=2) equals 10 electrons in total.

Looking at the options, option F is 10. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: sometimes, people talk about subshells. Like, the first shell has s orbital, which holds 2 electrons. The second shell has s and p orbitals. The s can hold 2, and the p can hold 6 (since each p subshell has 3 orbitals, each holding 2 electrons: 3*2=6). So n=2 has s and p, which is 2+6=8. So that still adds up to 8 for n=2. So n=1 is 2, n=2 is 8, total 10. Yeah, that seems right.

Another way to check: the atomic number of Neon is 10. Neon has electrons filled up to n=2, so it has 2+8=10 electrons. So that's correct. So the atom in question must have 10 electrons, which is option F.

The question asks how many electrons an atom has when its n = 1 and n = 2 energy levels are completely filled. 

1. For the n = 1 shell, the maximum number of electrons it can hold is given by the formula \( 2n^2 \), where \( n = 1 \). Thus, \( 2(1)^2 = 2 \) electrons.
2. For the n = 2 shell, using the same formula, \( 2(2)^2 = 8 \) electrons. This accounts for both the \( 2s \) and \( 2p \) subshells.
3. Adding the electrons from both shells: \( 2 + 8 = 10 \) electrons in total.

This matches the atomic number of Neon, which has 10 electrons and is the lightest noble gas with filled n = 1 and n = 2 shells.

The correct answer is **F: 10**.
