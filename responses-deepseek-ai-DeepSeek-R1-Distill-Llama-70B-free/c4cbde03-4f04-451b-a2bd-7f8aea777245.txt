Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the molarity of sodium ions in human blood serum. Hmm, let's see. I remember that molarity is moles per liter. Right, so the formula is M = moles/L.

The problem says each liter of blood serum has about 3.4 grams of Na+ ions. Oh wait, sodium has an ionic weight of 23 g/mole. So I need to convert grams to moles first.

So, moles of Na+ would be grams divided by molar mass. That would be 3.4 g divided by 23 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 3.4 divided by 23... 23 times 0.15 is 3.45, which is a bit more than 3.4. So maybe approximately 0.148 moles per liter.

Wait, wait, let me do the exact calculation. 3.4 divided by 23. Let's see, 23 times 0.14 is 3.22. 0.148 would give 23 * 0.148 = 3.404, which is just over 3.4, so maybe 3.4/23 is approximately 0.148. So that's about 0.148 moles per liter.

But wait, the options are A: 0.15, which is close. So 0.148 is roughly 0.15 M. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but sometimes in these problems, do I consider anything else? Like, is the volume exactly one liter? The question says each liter contains 3.4g, so the volume is 1 L. So no issues there. So yes, molarity is 0.148, which rounds to 0.15. So option A is correct.

To calculate the molarity of sodium ions (Na⁺) in human blood serum, we use the formula for molarity:

\[
M = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{volume of solution in liters}}
\]

The problem states that each liter of blood serum contains 3.4 g of Na⁺, and the molar mass of Na⁺ is 23 g/mol. First, we convert grams of Na⁺ to moles:

\[
\text{Moles of Na⁺} = \frac{\text{grams of Na⁺}}{\text{molar mass of Na⁺}} = \frac{3.4 \, \text{g}}{23 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.148 \, \text{mol}
\]

Since the volume is 1 liter, the molarity is:

\[
M = \frac{0.148 \, \text{mol}}{1 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.148 \, \text{M}
\]

Rounding to two significant figures, the molarity is approximately 0.15 M. Among the given options, the closest match is:

**A: 0.15 M**

Answer: A
