Question:

A plaintiff filed a civil action asking for damages resulting from a tortious assault that the defendant inflicted on him. During trial, plaintiff's counsel asked an opposing witness on cross examination: "At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?" Defense counsel objected to the question. How will the court rule on the objection?

Options:

A: The objection will be sustained because the question is misleading.
B: The objection will be overruled because the question is relevant to the case.
C: The objection will be overruled because leading questions are allowed on cross examination.
D: The objection will be sustained because the question is argumentative.
E: The objection will be overruled because the question is not leading or misleading.
F: The objection will be sustained because the question is irrelevant.
G: The objection will be overruled because leading questions are permitted in this context.
H: The objection will be sustained because the question assumes facts not in evidence.
I: The objection will be sustained because the question is leading.
J: The objection will be overruled because the question is within the allowable scope of cross examination.

Okay, so I have this question about evidence law and trial procedure. Let me try to break it down. The scenario is a civil trial where the plaintiff is suing for damages from a tortious assault. During the trial, the plaintiff's counsel is cross-examining a witness and asks, "At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?" The defense counsel objects. I need to figure out if the objection is sustained or overruled and why.

First, I remember that in a trial, the admissibility of questions depends on several rules. The main issues here might be relevance, whether the question is leading, or if it's misleading.

Cross-examination allows for leading questions. So if the objection is about the question being leading, the court would likely overrule it because leading questions are permitted on cross-exam. So options C, G, and maybe I are possibilities. But wait, in this question, the objection is simply made without specifying the ground, so I have to think about why the defense would object.

The question is, "At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?" Let me think about the context. The plaintiff is the one who was assaulted. The witness is an opposing witness, meaning they're likely a defense witness. So the plaintiff's counsel is cross-examining them.

Why would the defense object to that question? Maybe because it's irrelevant. But the question seems relevant because whether someone tried to leave during the assault could relate to issues like self-defense, provocation, or the nature of the assault. So perhaps relevance isn't the main issue here.

Another possibility is that the question assumes a fact not in evidence. If there's no evidence that an assault occurred, but wait, the plaintiff is suing for tortious assault, so the fact that an assault happened is part of the plaintiff's case. So the question might be proper.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "during the assault." If the occurrence of the assault is in dispute, then the question might be improper because it assumes that an assault happened. But in a civil case, the plaintiff has to prove the assault occurred, so perhaps the question is assuming a fact not yet established. But I think in this context, the question is about the events during the assault, which the plaintiff is alleging. So the court might allow it because it's within the scope of the case.

Alternatively, maybe the question is leading. But as I thought earlier, leading questions are allowed in cross-exam, so that wouldn't be a problem.

Another angle: the question could be considered compound or ambiguous. But it doesn't seem to be; it's a straightforward question about whether anyone tried to leave during the assault.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the question is irrelevant. If the ability to leave or not doesn't relate to any issue in the case, then it's irrelevant. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's relevant to the issue of whether the plaintiff was trapped or had a chance to retreat, which could tie into self-defense or the severity of the assault.

Alternatively, the objection might be on the grounds that the question is argumentative, but that's less likely. The question is a yes/no question and isn't phrased in an argumentative way.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Overruled because relevant. That's possible.

Option C: Overruled because leading questions allowed on cross. That's correct, but the question is not necessarily leading. Wait, the question is phrased as "did anyone attempt to leave?" It's a yes/no question, but it's not leading because it doesn't suggest an answer. Or is it? It might be a leading question if it's suggesting that someone did try to leave, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a neutral question.

Option H: Sustained because it assumes facts not in evidence. If the fact of the assault hasn't been established, then the question could be improper. But in this case, the plaintiff's case is based on the assault, so the question is about the events during it, which is part of what the plaintiff is trying to prove. So maybe it's allowed.

Wait, but perhaps the issue is that the question is asking about "anyone" attempting to leave. If the plaintiff is the one who was assaulted, maybe the question is trying to get the witness to say that the plaintiff tried to leave, which could imply that the plaintiff was the initial aggressor or something. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is trying to establish that the plaintiff had the opportunity to leave but didn't, which could relate to damages or the nature of the assault.

I think the key point is whether the question is relevant. Since it's about the events during the assault, and the assault is the basis of the claim, the question is relevant. Therefore, the objection would be overruled because the question is relevant.

So looking at the options, option B says the objection will be overruled because the question is relevant. Option G says overruled because leading questions are permitted, but the question isn't necessarily leading. So I think it's more about relevance.

Alternatively, another thought: the question is about whether "anyone" attempted to leave. If the witness didn't see anyone, maybe the question is trying to get a negative answer, but that's still within the scope of cross-exam.

Wait, but perhaps the question is improper because it's phrased in a way that's misleading. If the question is, "At any time during the assault, did anyone attempt to leave?" it might imply that someone did, which could be misleading if there's no evidence. But I don't think that's the case here.

I'm leaning towards the objection being overruled because the question is relevant to the case. So option B or J.

Option J says overruled because within allowable scope of cross-exam. Well, the scope is determined by the direct exam. But this is a cross-exam question; the scope is generally broader, so it's allowed.

Wait, but in this case, the question is about a fact relevant to the case, so it's within the scope.

Hmm. So perhaps option B is more specific about relevance, while option J is about the scope. Both could be correct, but I think the main issue is relevance.

Wait, but the question is about whether anyone attempted to leave during the assault. That could relate to the issue of whether the plaintiff could have retreated or whether the defendant continued the assault even when the plaintiff tried to leave, which speaks to the severity or intent.

Therefore, the question is relevant, so the objection would be overruled. So the options are B and J.

Wait, option J says it's within the allowable scope of cross-exam. Since cross-exam can cover any relevant matter, and this is relevant, both B and J could apply. But the question is about why the court overrules the objection. So which reason is more accurate?

The objection is likely on the basis of relevance or leading. Since leading is allowed, and the question is relevant, the court would overrule the objection. So options B and J are both possible.

But looking at the options, option B says the question is relevant, so that's a reason to overrule. Option J is about the scope of cross-exam, which is broader.

I think the more precise reason is relevance, so option B.

Wait, but another thought: the question may not be leading, so options C, G, and I are about leading questions. Since the question is yes/no but doesn't suggest the answer, it's not leading. So the objection can't be sustained on that ground.

If the defense objected on the basis of relevance, and the court finds it relevant, then the objection is overruled. So the correct answer would be option B.

The question revolves around whether the court will sustain or overrule the defense counsel's objection to the plaintiff's counsel's question during cross-examination: "At any time during the assault did anyone attempt to leave?" The key issues to consider are relevance, whether the question is leading, and whether it assumes facts not in evidence.

1. **Relevance**: The question pertains to events during the assault, which is central to the plaintiff's case. It could relate to issues like self-defense, provocation, or the severity of the assault. Since the assault is the basis of the lawsuit, the question is relevant.

2. **Leading Questions**: Leading questions are generally allowed during cross-examination. However, the question here is phrased neutrally as a yes/no inquiry and does not suggest an answer, so it is not inherently leading.

3. **Assumption of Facts**: The question refers to "the assault," which is part of the plaintiff's allegations. While the occurrence of the assault is ultimately a fact to be proven, the question is permissible in this context because it is within the scope of the case.

Given these considerations, the objection is most likely overruled because the question is relevant to the case. While other options, such as the scope of cross-examination, could also apply, the primary reason for overruling the objection is the relevance of the question.
