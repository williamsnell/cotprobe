Okay, so I have this question about familial hypercholesterolaemia and the gene mutation causing it. Hmm, I remember that it's a genetic disorder related to high cholesterol. Let me think about what I learned in biochemistry.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia, or FH, is known for causing very high levels of LDL cholesterol. I think it's because the body can't remove LDL effectively from the bloodstream. Oh wait, I remember something about receptors. The LDL receptor is responsible for taking LDL particles into the liver cells. If that receptor isn't working properly, the LDL can't be cleared, leading to a buildup in the blood.

So the question is asking which gene's mutation causes this. The options are A through J. Looking at the options, option C is Low density lipoprotein receptor. That makes sense because if the receptor is defective, LDL can't be taken up by the liver, so it accumulates.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing this up with another condition. Familial hypercholesterolaemia is definitely linked to the LDL receptor. There's another condition called familial hypertriglyceridemia, which might involve lipoprotein lipase, which is option G, but that's triglycerides, not cholesterol.

Another angle: Statins work by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase (option F), which is an enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. But that's treatment, not the cause of the disease. So F is probably not the answer.

Option A is low density lipoprotein itself. The gene wouldn't encode LDL; LDL is a lipoprotein particle. So the gene must encode a receptor or a protein involved in its metabolism.

Option H is Apolipoprotein B. Apo B is part of the LDL particle. Mutations here could affect how LDL is recognized by the receptor. Wait, there's a condition called familial defective apolipoprotein B, which is a cause of high LDL. But isn't that a different condition from familial hypercholesterolaemia? So in that case, the main cause of FH is the receptor.

So the correct answer should be C: Low density lipoprotein receptor.

Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated levels of LDL cholesterol due to impaired removal of LDL from the bloodstream. This occurs because the LDL receptor, which is responsible for binding LDL particles and facilitating their uptake into liver cells, is defective. The gene encoding the LDL receptor is mutated in this condition, leading to the accumulation of LDL in the blood. While other options like apolipoprotein B (H) or HMG-CoA reductase (F) are related to cholesterol metabolism, the primary cause of FH is the mutation in the gene encoding the LDL receptor.

Answer: C
