Question:

A toy collector had purchased 10 antique toys over the last several years and had had them restored by an expert in toy restoration. On June 1, the collector sent the 11th antique toy to the expert with a signed note that read: "Here is another toy for you to restore. As with all prior jobs, I will pay $500 for the work, but no more." On June 4, after receipt of the collector's June 1 note and the toy, the expert began restoring the toy. On June 6, the collector unexpectedly died. On June 7, unaware of the collector's death, the expert sent the collector a note that stated that the restoration work had begun on June 4. The following day, the expert learned of the collector's death. Does a contract exist that binds the expert and the collector's estate?

Options:

A: Yes, because the expert sent the June 7 note before learning of the collector's death.
B: Yes, because the previous successful contracts set a precedent for this one.
C: No, because the collector died before the expert sent the June 7 note.
D: No, because the contract was not formally written and signed.
E: No, because the expert was not aware of the collector's death before starting the restoration.
F: No, because the offer lapsed when the collector died.
G: Yes, because the expert had already accepted the work and payment terms.
H: Yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.
I: No, because the collector's estate did not confirm the contract.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully to understand all the details.

So, there's a toy collector who's been buying antique toys and having them restored by an expert. He's done this 10 times before. On June 1, he sends the 11th toy with a note that says, "Here's another toy for you to restore. As with all prior jobs, I'll pay $500, but no more." Then, the expert receives this on June 4 and starts restoring the toy that same day. The collector dies on June 6. On June 7, the expert, not knowing the collector died, sends a note saying the work began on June 4. The expert finds out about the death the next day.

The question is whether there's a contract between the expert and the collector's estate.

Hmm, I remember that contract formation generally requires offer, acceptance, and consideration. So, let me break this down.

First, the collector sent the toy and a note. The note seems to be an offer because it's proposing to pay $500 for the restoration. The expert has done this 10 times before, so there's a prior course of dealing. That might be relevant for implied terms or how the offer is accepted.

The expert received the offer on June 4 and started the work that day. Does starting the work count as acceptance? Usually, acceptance can be by conduct. If the offer was to do the work for $500, and the expert starts the work, that might be an acceptance by performance.

Wait, but when does the acceptance happen? If the expert started restoring on June 4, that would be the day they received the offer. So, does that mean they accepted by starting the work on the same day they received the offer?

I think so. Because in contract law, if the offer invites acceptance by performance, then starting the performance would be acceptance. Since they've done this 10 times before, the expert knows that starting the work is a way to accept.

So, the offer was made on June 1, received on June 4, and accepted by the expert starting work on June 4. That would mean the contract was formed on June 4, before the collector died on June 6.

Wait, but the collector died on June 6, and the expert didn't send the note until June 7. Does that matter? Or is the contract already formed when the expert started the work?

I think the key is that the expert accepted the offer by starting the work on June 4. So the contract was formed on that day, regardless of when the expert sent the note. The note sent on June 7 was just informing the collector of the start, but the acceptance had already happened.

So, the contract was in place before the collector's death. Therefore, the expert can enforce the contract against the estate.

Looking at the options:

Option B says yes because previous contracts set a precedent. That's about course of dealing, which is relevant but maybe not the main point here.

Option G says yes because the expert accepted and the payment terms were agreed. That seems right because the expert accepted by starting work.

Option H says yes because the offer was accepted before the collector's death. That's exactly what I was thinkingâ€”the acceptance happened on June 4, so the contract was formed before the death.

Wait, but let me double-check. The offer was sent on June 1, received on June 4. The expert started work on June 4, which is acceptance. So the contract exists as of June 4. The collector's death is on June 6, which is after the contract was formed.

So, the correct answer would be that a contract exists because the expert accepted before the collector died.

Looking at the options again:

H: Yes, because the offer was accepted before the collector's death.

Yes, that fits. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but what about option G? G says the expert accepted the work and payment terms. That also seems correct, but H is more specific about the timing relative to the death.

I think H is the better choice because it directly addresses that the acceptance (and thus the contract) occurred before the death, making the estate bound.
</think>

To determine whether a contract exists between the expert and the collector's estate, we analyze the elements of contract formation: offer, acceptance, and consideration. The collector's June 1 note, which stated the terms of payment ($500 for restoration), constitutes an offer. The expert received this offer on June 4 and began restoring the toy that same day. Under contract law, acceptance can be demonstrated through conduct, and starting the work constitutes acceptance of the offer. Since the expert began the work on June 4, the contract was formed on that date.

The collector's death on June 6 occurred after the contract was already formed, and the expert's note sent on June 7 merely informed the collector of the work's commencement. The key issue is that the contract was validly formed before the collector's death, and thus the estate is bound by it.

Option H correctly identifies that the contract exists because the offer was accepted (through the expert's actions) before the collector's death. This makes H the most accurate answer.

Answer: H
