Okay, so I've got this finance problem here about dividends for preferred and common stock. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the company is Novelco Corporation. They have 1,000 shares of cumulative preferred stock and 20,000 shares of common stock. The preferred stock has a par value of $100 each and pays a 6% dividend. So first, I think I need to calculate how much the preferred stock dividends would be each year.

Wait, cumulative preferred stock means that any dividends not paid in a given year accumulate and must be paid before any common stock dividends, right? So if they miss a dividend payment in one year, they have to make it up in the next.

The problem says that in the first year, there were no funds available for dividends. So the preferred stockholders didn't get their dividend in the first year. Then, in the second year, there's $14,000 available.

Let me calculate the annual dividend for the preferred stock. Each share is $100, and the rate is 6%, so per share that's 100 * 0.06 = $6 per year. Since there are 1,000 shares, the total preferred dividend per year is 1,000 * 6 = $6,000.

So in the first year, they had no money, so the $6,000 wasn't paid. Since it's cumulative, that $6,000 becomes a dividend in arrears and must be paid in the second year before any common dividends.

In the second year, they have $14,000 available. They need to pay the preferred stock first. So the preferred stock is owed two years' worth of dividends because the first year was missed. So that's 6,000 * 2 = $12,000.

Wait, noâ€”wait. Wait a second. No, wait. Because each year's dividend is separate. So first year's dividend is $6,000, which wasn't paid. So in the second year, the company has to pay both the first year's missed dividend and the second year's dividend. So total preferred would be $6,000 (year 1) + $6,000 (year 2) = $12,000.

But wait, the company only has $14,000 available in the second year. So after paying the preferred, how much is left for common?

So $14,000 available. Subtract the $12,000 for preferred, which leaves $2,000 for common stock.

Wait, but wait again. Let me double-check. The preferred stock is cumulative, so any unpaid dividends are added to the next year. So yes, first year's $6k is due in the second year, plus the second year's $6k. So total preferred is $12k. Then the remaining $2k goes to common.

Wait, but the question is about the dividends per year for each class of stock. So for each year, how much did each class get.

Wait, the question says, find the dividends per year for each class of stock. So it's asking for each year's dividend, not the total over two years.

Wait, no, I think I misread. Let me read the question again.

The question is: Find the dividends per year for each class of stock.

Hmm. So for each of the two years, how much did each class get.

Wait, but the options are given as a single amount for each class. Oh wait, the options are per year? Or for the two years combined?

Looking at the options, for example, option A says $9,000 for preferred and $5,000 for common. But over two years, the total preferred would be $18,000, which doesn't add up because the first year they had nothing. So perhaps the options represent the per year amounts.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says, during the first two years, the amounts available for dividends were: None in the first year, and $14,000 in the second.

So for year 1: available for dividends is $0.

So no dividends can be paid to anyone. So for year 1, both preferred and common get $0.

But wait, preferred is cumulative, so the $6k for year 1 is in arrears and must be paid before any common in year 2.

So in year 2, the company has $14k. They have to pay the preferred stock the $6k from year 1 and the $6k for year 2, totaling $12k. Then the remaining $2k (14k -12k) can go to common.

So for each year:

Year 1:

Preferred: $0 (since no funds)

Common: $0

Year 2:

Preferred: $12k (6k from year 1 and 6k for year 2)

Common: $2k

But the options don't present this as separate years. The options list a single amount for each class, so I'm a bit confused now. Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the total for the two years. Or per year.

Wait the question says, "Find the dividends per year for each class of stock." So perhaps for each year, but the options don't list two years' worth of data. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the dividends each year, but the options are presenting the total for the two years. Or maybe the question is asking for the second year only.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for each year's dividends, but the options only give the second year. Because in the first year, nothing was paid, so perhaps the answer is that in the second year, preferred gets $12k and common gets $2k. So the option that says preferred gets $12k and common $2k would be the correct one.

Looking at the options:

E: $12,000 preferred and $2,000 common.

Yes, that's option E.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option E says: $12,000 for preferred and $2,000 for common. That matches what I calculated for the second year.

But the question is about per year for each class. So the first year, both get zero, and second year, preferred gets $12k and common $2k. But the options don't have that, so perhaps the question is only about the second year, or the total.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the total over the two years. But in that case, preferred would get $12k and common $2k. So the correct option would be E.

Wait, but let me read the question again: "Find the dividends per year for each class of stock." So per year, meaning for each year, but the options don't present per year data, they present a single figure. Hmm, perhaps the question is only about the second year.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total dividends each class received over the two years, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking what each class gets each year, but since the first year they couldn't pay anything, and the second year they paid $12k to preferred and $2k to common, so the correct answer would be that in year two, preferred gets $12k and common gets $2k, which is option E.

But looking back at the options, option E is $12k preferred and $2k common.

Yes, that's correct. So the correct answer should be E.

The Novelco Corporation has 1,000 shares of cumulative preferred stock and 20,000 shares of common stock. The preferred stock has a par value of $100 per share and pays a 6% dividend, amounting to $6 per share annually. Therefore, the total annual dividend for preferred stock is:

\[
1,000 \, \text{shares} \times \$6 = \$6,000
\]

Since the preferred stock is cumulative, any unpaid dividends accrue and must be paid before common stock dividends. In the first year, no funds were available for dividends, so the $6,000 preferred dividend went unpaid. In the second year, $14,000 was available for dividends. The company must first pay the $6,000 from the first year (in arrears) and the $6,000 for the second year, totaling:

\[
\$6,000 \, (\text{first year}) + \$6,000 \, (\text{second year}) = \$12,000
\]

After paying the preferred stock dividends, the remaining amount for common stock dividends is:

\[
\$14,000 - \$12,000 = \$2,000
\]

Thus, in the second year, the preferred stock receives $12,000, and the common stock receives $2,000. This matches option E, which states:

**$12,000 for preferred stock and $2,000 for common stock.**
