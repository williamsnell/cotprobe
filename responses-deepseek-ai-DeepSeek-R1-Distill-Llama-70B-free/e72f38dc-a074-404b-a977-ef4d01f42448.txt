Okay, so I've got this question here about philosophy, and I need to figure it out. The question is asking which philosopher called the idea of natural rights "nonsense on stilts." Hmm, I remember hearing that phrase before, but I'm not exactly sure who said it. Let me try to think through this.

First, I should probably break down the question. Natural rights are a concept in philosophy, often associated with thinkers like John Locke. Locke talked about life, liberty, and property as natural rights. So if someone criticized that idea, it might be someone who didn't agree with those Enlightenment-era ideas.

The phrase "nonsense on stilts" sounds pretty dismissive. I think it's a criticism of the idea that natural rights are inherent and universal. So maybe it's someone from a different school of thought, perhaps a utilitarian or someone who focused more on societal contracts rather than inherent rights.

Let me go through the options one by one:

A: Socrates - He was more of an ancient Greek philosopher, focused on ethics and knowledge. I don't recall him talking about natural rights in that way. Probably not him.

B: John Locke - He's the one who actually supported natural rights, so he wouldn't call them nonsense. So it's definitely not B.

C: Immanuel Kant - He had his own theories about rights and duties, more deontological ethics. I don't think he used that phrase. Plus, he's more about reason and categorical imperatives.

D: Emmanuel Kant - Wait, isn't that the same as option C? Maybe a typo. Either way, same reasoning applies.

E: René Descartes - He's known for "I think, therefore I am." His work was more on mind-body dualism, not really about natural rights in a critical way.

F: Thomas Hobbes - He believed in the social contract and that without society, life is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." His view on rights is that they're given by the sovereign, not natural. But did he use that specific phrase? I'm not sure. I think he might have been critical of natural rights, but I don't remember the exact wording.

G: Alan Gerwith - I'm not very familiar with him. Maybe a contemporary philosopher? Not sure if he's associated with that phrase.

H: Jeremy Bentham - Ah, now this rings a bell. Bentham was a utilitarian who focused on the greatest happiness for the greatest number. He was critical of the concept of natural rights, calling them "nonsense upon stilts." Yeah, I think that's right. He didn't believe in inherent rights, instead emphasizing utility.

I: John Stuart Mill - Another utilitarian, but I think Mill was more about individual liberty and the harm principle. He might have had some critiques, but I don't recall him using that exact phrase.

J: Friedrich Nietzsche - He was critical of many traditional philosophies, but I'm not sure if he specifically used that phrase about natural rights. His criticisms were more about morality and the death of God.

Putting it all together, Jeremy Bentham (option H) is the one who called natural rights "nonsense on stilts." He didn't believe in natural or innate rights and thought they were illogical, hence the strong statement.
