Question:

Mr. Brennan owns an open field adjacent to his house. The coach of the local high school football team offered Mr. Brennan $250 to rent the field from him for his team's summer football drills. Mr. Brennan could also grow vege-tables on the field. The cost of seed, fertilizer, and hiring neighborhood teenagers to plant and harvest the field he estimates would be $200 and Mr. Brennan expects to receive $500 if he sold the vegetables. What are the explicit and implicit costs to Mr. Brennan of growing vege-tables, and will he choose to grow vegetables or rent the field?

Options:

A: Do nothing
B: Sell the field
C: Grow vegetables
D: Rent the field

Okay, so I've got this question here about Mr. Brennan and his field. Hmm, I think I should break it down step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

So, Mr. Brennan owns an open field next to his house. The high school coach offered him $250 to rent the field for summer football drills. Alternatively, Mr. Brennan could grow vegetables there. The costs for seeds, fertilizer, and hiring help are $200. He expects to make $500 from selling the vegetables. The question is about the explicit and implicit costs of growing vegetables and whether he'll choose to grow them or rent the field.

Wait, explicit and implicit costs. Explicit costs are the direct, out-of-pocket expenses, right? Like the money he spends on seeds, fertilizer, and labor. So in this case, that's $200. That's straightforward.

Implicit costs are the opportunity costs, which are what you give up by choosing one option over another. So if Mr. Brennan decides to grow vegetables, he can't rent the field. So the $250 he would have earned from renting becomes an implicit cost because it's the income he's forgoing. Alternatively, if he rents the field, the profit from vegetables is the implicit cost.

So, the explicit cost of growing veggies is $200, and the implicit cost is the $250 rental offer. 

Now, to decide whether he'll grow vegetables or rent the field. Let's calculate the profit from each option.

If he grows vegetables: Revenue is $500, explicit costs are $200. So profit is 500 - 200 = $300.

If he rents the field, he gets $250. But wait, that's only the rental income. If he doesn't grow vegetables, he's giving up the $300 profit (since 500-200=300). So in that case, the opportunity cost of renting is $300. Comparing $250 (rent) vs $300 (profit from veggies), he'd make more money growing vegetables.

So he should choose to grow vegetables because the profit is higher than the rental income.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question is about explicit and implicit costs. So when calculating the cost of growing vegetables, explicit is $200, implicit is $250. So total cost is $450. But wait, is that correct? Or is the implicit cost only the opportunity cost of his time or other resources? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, opportunity cost is the cost of the next best alternative. So by choosing to grow vegetables, he's giving up the $250. So the implicit cost is $250. So his total cost for growing vegetables is explicit ($200) + implicit ($250) = $450. His revenue is $500. So profit would be 500 - 450 = $50. But wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.

Wait no, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think again. The explicit costs are the direct payments he makes: seeds, fertilizer, labor. That's $200. The implicit costs are the income he could have made from the next best alternative, which is the $250 rent. So implicit cost is $250. So total cost is $200 + $250 = $450. Revenue is $500, so profit is $50.

Alternatively, if he rents, he gets $250 with no explicit costs. But then, the opportunity cost is the $500 he could have made from selling veggies minus the $200 costs, which is $300 profit. So by renting, he gains $250 but loses the chance to make $300. So the net loss is $50. So he's better off growing vegetables.

Wait, but earlier I thought the profit was $300. Hmm, maybe I should consider whether the $500 is revenue, not profit. So, when he grows vegetables, his profit is $500 - $200 = $300. But if he chooses to grow, he gives up the $250 rental, so that's an opportunity cost. So his net gain from growing is $300 (profit) minus $250 (opportunity cost) = $50. So he gains $50 by growing instead of renting. Therefore, he should choose to grow.

Alternatively, if he rents, he gets $250, but gives up $300 profit, so he's out $50. So either way, it's better to grow.

So the explicit costs are $200, implicit are $250. He'll choose to grow vegetables.

So the options are C or D. The question is whether he'll choose to grow or rent. So the answer is C: Grow vegetables.

Mr. Brennan has two options for his field: rent it to the high school coach for $250 or grow vegetables. To decide, we need to calculate the explicit and implicit costs of growing vegetables and compare the profitability of each option.

**Explicit Costs**: These are the direct, out-of-pocket expenses for growing vegetables, which include the cost of seeds, fertilizer, and labor. These total $200.

**Implicit Costs**: These are the opportunity costs, which represent the value of the next best alternative. If Mr. Brennan chooses to grow vegetables, he forgoes the $250 rental income, making this the implicit cost.

Now, let's evaluate the profitability of each option:

1. **Growing Vegetables**:
   - Revenue: $500 (from selling vegetables).
   - Explicit Costs: $200.
   - Implicit Costs: $250 (forgone rental income).
   - Total Costs: $200 (explicit) + $250 (implicit) = $450.
   - Profit: $500 (revenue) - $450 (total costs) = $50.

2. **Renting the Field**:
   - Rental Income: $250.
   - Opportunity Cost: The profit from growing vegetables, which is $300 ($500 revenue - $200 explicit costs).
   - Net Gain: $250 (rental income) - $300 (opportunity cost) = -$50 (a net loss).

Since growing vegetables results in a $50 profit, while renting the field results in a $50 net loss, Mr. Brennan is better off growing vegetables.

**Conclusion**: The explicit costs of growing vegetables are $200, and the implicit costs are $250. Mr. Brennan will choose to grow vegetables because it yields a higher net gain.
