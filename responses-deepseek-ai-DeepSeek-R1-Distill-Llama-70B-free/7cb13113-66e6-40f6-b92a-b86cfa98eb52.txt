Question:

A woman joined a web site to get her credit reports. The site required creation of an account before she could enter. On that form, a notice appeared in bold letters: "TERMS AND CONDITIONS: This is a Contract. By creating an account, you agree to and accept the terms and conditions for use of this website." She did not access the terms, which she could have done by clicking a conspicuous link. She started an account and paid $50 for a credit report. For the next 6 months, her credit card was automatically billed $50, without notice, except that she received email notice that the report was available at the site. The terms and conditions provided that she authorized the charges, unless she notified the company otherwise in advance. Which party will likely prevail on the issue of whether she was bound to pay for the 6 months until she canceled?

Options:

A: The company will prevail because the woman had the opportunity to review the terms and conditions before agreeing to them.
B: The company will prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible.
C: The woman will prevail because terms and conditions have been ruled to be contracts of adhesion that are largely unenforceable.
D: The woman will prevail because the terms and conditions, or important parts, must be described on the 'create an account' page, which was not done here.
E: The company will prevail because the woman failed to cancel her subscription and thus implicitly agreed to the terms.
F: The company will prevail because any mention of terms and conditions is enough to put the prospective member on notice of contract terms.
G: The woman will prevail because she did not explicitly agree to the recurring charges.
H: The woman will prevail because she was not given explicit notice of the recurring charges.
I: The company will prevail because the woman did not cancel her subscription and thus accepted the terms.
J: The woman will prevail because the terms were not explicitly stated before she made the initial payment.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about contract law, specifically regarding terms and conditions on a website. Let me break it down.

The scenario is a woman who signs up for a website to get her credit reports. She has to create an account first. On the form, there's a bold notice saying, "TERMS AND CONDITIONS: This is a Contract. By creating an account, you agree to and accept the terms and conditions for use of this website." There's a link to the terms, but she didn't click on it. She went ahead, paid $50, and then got charged $50 automatically every month for six months without any notice except emails saying her report was available. The terms she didn't read said she authorized the charges unless she told the company otherwise in advance.

The question is whether she's bound to pay for those six months until she canceled. So, the main issue here is whether she agreed to the terms and conditions, especially the part about recurring charges.

I remember that in contract law, for a term to be enforceable, the party must have notice of it. This is especially important in consumer contracts where terms are often presented in a way that might not be immediately obvious. Courts often look at whether the terms were sufficiently brought to the attention of the consumer.

In this case, the notice was in bold and there was a link, but she didn't read them. So the question is, is that enough for the company to enforce the terms? Or does the company need to do more, like have her explicitly agree to each significant term, especially something like recurring charges which could be a surprise.

I think about cases like the one where a user didn't read the terms but the court still upheld them because they were available. But there's also the idea that certain terms, especially those that are not obvious or are onerous, need to be specifically highlighted. For example, an automatic renewal clause might require more prominent notice than just a link in the terms and conditions.

So here, the terms were in a link, but the bold notice just said she agreed by creating an account. She didn't have to check a box next to the terms or anything; she just proceeded after seeing the notice. The fact that the recurring charge was buried in the terms she didn't read might be a problem for the company.

I'm thinking that even though the terms were available via a link, the key point is whether she had sufficient notice of the specific term about recurring charges. If that term wasn't brought to her attention in a way that she would have known about it, she might not be bound by it. 

Looking at the options:

Option A says the company prevails because she had the opportunity to review. But just having the opportunity isn't enough if she didn't actually know about the specific term.

Option B says the company wins because the notice was in bold and the contract accessible. But again, the issue is the specific term about the charges, which she didn't see.

Option D suggests she wins because important parts weren't on the create account page. That makes sense if the court requires that key terms be presented where she can see them without clicking.

Option G says she wins because she didn't explicitly agree to recurring charges. That's possible, but the question is whether implicit agreement through the terms is enough.

Option H says she wins because she wasn't given explicit notice of the charges. That seems to align with the idea that the specific term needs to be highlighted.

So I'm leaning towards either D or H. The key is whether the terms were adequately brought to her attention. If the terms were only accessible via a link that she didn't click, and the charges weren't mentioned on the main page, then the company might not have provided sufficient notice. 

In some cases, courts have found that terms need to be conspicuous and that a mere link might not be enough for certain important provisions. So if the recurring charge was a significant term, the company should have made sure she was aware of it, perhaps by including it on the main page or requiring her to check a box acknowledging it.

Therefore, the woman might prevail because she wasn't given explicit notice of the recurring charges. So the correct answer would be H.

The issue revolves around whether the woman was sufficiently notified of the recurring charges in the terms and conditions. For a term to be enforceable, it must be brought to the consumer's attention, especially if it involves significant financial obligations like automatic renewals or recurring charges. In this case, the terms were accessible via a link, but the specific term about recurring charges was not explicitly highlighted on the main page. Courts often require that such critical terms be made conspicuous to consumers, beyond merely providing a link to the full terms and conditions. Since the woman did not receive explicit notice of the recurring charges, she may not be bound by that term. 

Option H correctly reflects this reasoning, as it emphasizes the lack of explicit notice regarding the recurring charges.
