Okay, so I've got this economics question here about how a balanced budget affects NNP when the MPC is 0.8. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the question says the government is levying taxes of $100 billion and making expenditures of $100 billion. So they're equal, which means it's a balanced budget. I remember that a balanced budget means government spending is equal to the taxes collected. But how does that affect the overall economy, specifically the Net National Product (NNP)?

Wait, NNP is like the total value of goods and services produced, right? So we're looking at how taxes and government spending influence that. I think this is related to fiscal policy and the multiplier effect.

The key here is understanding the impact of taxes and expenditures on aggregate demand. When the government spends, it injects money into the economy, which should increase demand. On the other hand, taxes take money out of people's pockets, which can decrease demand. But since the budget is balanced, the two are equal. So maybe the multiplier effects of each offset each other?

I recall that the multiplier effect depends on the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). The formula for the multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC). So with an MPC of 0.8, the multiplier would be 1/(1 - 0.8) = 1/0.2 = 5. That means each dollar of government spending or change in taxes can have a multiplied effect on the economy.

But wait, how do taxes and expenditures interact here? Let me think. If the government increases spending by $100 billion, that's a positive impact on aggregate demand. That would lead to an increase in NNP by the multiplier amount. So, 100 billion * 5 = $500 billion increase. But taxes are also increasing by $100 billion. How does that factor in?

Oh right, taxes reduce disposable income, which in turn reduces consumption. So the tax increase would have a negative multiplier effect. The tax multiplier is a bit different, maybe. Wait, I think the tax multiplier is actually -MPC/(1 - MPC). So in this case, that would be -0.8/(1 - 0.8) = -4. So a $100 billion tax increase would lead to a decrease in NNP by 100 * 4 = $400 billion.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, I've heard that the expenditure and tax multipliers might be the same but opposite in sign. Let me make sure. If the government spends, it's a direct injection, so the multiplier is positive. Taxes are a subtraction, so their multiplier is negative. So maybe the tax multiplier is just the negative of the expenditure multiplier.

Hold on, the balanced budget means that G = T. So the change in G is +100B, and change in T is +100B. So the effect of G on NNP is positive, and the effect of T is negative. So let's compute both.

The expenditure multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC) = 5. So 100B spending leads to 500B increase in NNP. The tax multiplier is (MPC/(1 - MPC)) but negative because taxes reduce income. So tax multiplier is - (0.8)/(0.2) = -4. So 100B taxes lead to 400B decrease in NNP.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm a bit confused here. The tax multiplier is actually calculated as the MPC/(1 - MPC) but negative. So the effect is - (MPC/(1 - MPC)) * change in taxes. So 0.8/0.2 = 4, so -4 * 100B = -400B. 

So the total effect on NNP would be the sum of the two effects. The spending adds 500B, and the taxes subtract 400B. So 500B - 400B = 100B net increase in NNP. Wait, but that can't be right because the budget is balanced. Does a balanced budget expansion really cause an increase?

Wait no, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again. Alternatively, when the government increases spending and taxes by the same amount, the net effect is the difference between the two multipliers. So the expenditure multiplier is 5, and the tax multiplier is -4. So the combined multiplier is 5 -4 = 1. So a $100B increase in both G and T leads to a 100B * (1) = 100B increase in NNP.

Wait, but wait another point. The initial situation is that the government is collecting $100B in taxes and spending $100B. But if they were not doing this before, then introducing a new balanced budget. Alternatively, perhaps we should consider that the taxes and spending are new. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the change from zero to $100B each, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe it's a balanced budget where previously it wasn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the government's actions (taxing and spending) affect the economy. So the net effect is spending minus taxes, but in this case, they're equal. So the net effect is zero? No, that doesn't seem right because the multipliers are different.

Wait, another approach. Let's model it step by step. Suppose the economy is at equilibrium where aggregate demand equals aggregate supply. The government's actions can shift this equilibrium.

The initial situation is that the government is not taxing or spending, or perhaps the question is about a change. Wait, the question says the government seeks to achieve a balanced budget by levying taxes and making expenditures. So perhaps prior to this, the government wasn't doing this, and now it is. So the change is an increase of $100B in taxes and $100B in spending.

So the change in government purchases (G) is +100B, and the change in taxes (T) is +100B. So the effect on NNP would be the sum of the two effects.

So the effect of G on NNP is (1/(1 - MPC)) * delta G = (1/0.2)*100B = 500B increase.

The effect of T on NNP is (-MPC/(1 - MPC)) * delta T = (-0.8/0.2)*100B = -400B.

So the total effect is 500B - 400B = +100B increase in NNP.

Wait, but that would mean the NNP increases by $100B. So looking at the options, option G says "Increase of $100 billion in NNP". So that would be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the tax multiplier. Some sources say the tax multiplier is (MPC/(1 - MPC)), but others might say it's (1 - MPC)/MPC or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the balanced budget multiplier. I remember that in a balanced budget, the multiplier is (1 - MPC) + MPC*(1 - t), but that's perhaps getting complicated. Alternatively, the balanced budget multiplier is the change in G divided by the change in taxes, multiplied by the expenditure multiplier. Wait, no, perhaps it's 1/(1 - MPC) * (delta G - delta T). Wait, but in this case, delta G and delta T are both equal to 100B. So the net effect is zero? That can't be.

Wait, no. Because G is an injection and T is a leakage. So the effect of G is positive, and T is negative. So the total effect is G*(multiplier) - T*(tax multiplier).

Wait, the expenditure multiplier is 5, tax multiplier is 4 (but negative). So 100B *5 = +500B, and 100B * (-4) = -400B. So 500 -400 = +100B.

So the NNP increases by $100B. So the correct answer would be option G.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: when the government spends $100B, that adds directly to aggregate demand. But the $100B in taxes reduces disposable income, which reduces consumption. The initial injection from G is $100B, but the tax reduces C by MPC*100B, which is 80B. So the net initial effect is 100B (G) -80B (lost C) = +20B. Then this 20B gets multiplied. So the total effect would be 20B * multiplier (1/(1 - 0.8)) = 20B * 5 = 100B. Yes, same result.

So the NNP should increase by $100B. Looking at the options, that's option G.

To determine how a balanced budget of $100 billion in taxes and $100 billion in expenditures affects NNP when the MPC = 0.8, we analyze the multiplier effects of government spending and taxation.

1. **Expenditure Multiplier**: Government spending directly injects money into the economy, increasing aggregate demand. The expenditure multiplier is calculated as:

   \[
   \text{Expenditure Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - \text{MPC}} = \frac{1}{1 - 0.8} = 5
   \]

   A $100 billion increase in government spending leads to:

   \[
   \Delta \text{NNP from Spending} = 100 \times 5 = +\$500 \text{ billion}
   \]

2. **Tax Multiplier**: Taxes reduce disposable income, which decreases consumption. The tax multiplier is calculated as:

   \[
   \text{Tax Multiplier} = -\frac{\text{MPC}}{1 - \text{MPC}} = -\frac{0.8}{1 - 0.8} = -4
   \]

   A $100 billion increase in taxes leads to:

   \[
   \Delta \text{NNP from Taxes} = 100 \times (-4) = -\$400 \text{ billion}
   \]

3. **Net Effect on NNP**: The total effect on NNP is the sum of the effects from spending and taxes:

   \[
   \Delta \text{NNP} = +\$500 \text{ billion} - \$400 \text{ billion} = +\$100 \text{ billion}
   \]

Thus, the balanced budget results in a $100 billion increase in NNP. This corresponds to option G.
