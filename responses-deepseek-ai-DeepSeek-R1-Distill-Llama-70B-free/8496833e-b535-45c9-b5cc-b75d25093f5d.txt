Okay, so I've got this question about the Federal Reserve System and the tools they use to control the economy. Hmm, I remember from my classes that the Fed has several main instruments, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact ones. Let me think.

The question is asking for the principal and selective instruments. I think principal means the main ones they use regularly, and selective might be more specific tools they use in certain situations. Wait, but maybe it's just the main tools they rely on.

I recall that the Fed uses open-market operations a lot. That's when they buy or sell government securities on the open market to influence the money supply. So that's definitely one of the main tools.

Another tool I remember is the discount rate. The Fed sets the interest rate at which banks can borrow money directly from them. Changing this rate can encourage or discourage banks from borrowing, which affects how much they lend out.

Then there's reserve requirements. The Fed requires banks to hold a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves rather than lending them out. If they change this requirement, it affects how much banks can lend and thus the money supply. Lowering the reserve requirement allows banks to lend more, increasing the money supply.

Wait, so putting it together, the main tools are open-market operations, discount rate, and reserve requirements. Let me look at the options.

Option A: Open-market, setting national budget, federal funds rate. Wait, the Fed doesn't set the national budget, that's Congress's job. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Open-market, discount rate, reserve requirements. That matches what I was thinking. So B looks good.

Option C: Fed funds rate, quantitative easing, alter tax rates. Tax rates are set by Congress, so C is wrong.

Option D: Interest rate adjustments (like federal funds rate?), liquidity ratio (maybe reserve requirements?), and open-market. Maybe, but I'm not sure. The Fed adjusts the discount rate, which is different from the federal funds rate. Also, D says interest rate adjustments, which might include the discount rate, but I'm not sure if that's the same as the federal funds rate. Wait, the federal funds rate is the rate banks charge each other, which the Fed influences through open-market operations. The discount rate is the Fed's own rate. So D might not be the exact correct terms.

Option E: Capital gains tax, reserve requirements, fed funds. Tax changes are not Fed tools, so E's wrong.

Option F: Discount rate, direct lending, exchange rate. Direct lending is part of the discount window, but setting exchange rates isn't a Fed tool; that's more the Treasury or other agencies. So F is out.

Option G: Discounting, margin requirements, ceilings on deposit interest. Discounting is the same as discount rate. Margin requirements are about stock purchases, which I think the Fed used to do more, but maybe not the primary tool now. Ceilings like Regulation Q, which they used to have but maybe not anymore. So G might include some older tools but not the main ones now.

Option H: Issuing currency, inflation target, open-market. Issuing currency is more the Treasury's job, I think. Adjusting inflation target is a goal, not a tool. So H is wrong.

Option I: Prime rate changes, reserve, bond purchases. The Fed doesn't set the prime rate; that's set by banks. Bond purchases are part of open-market operations, so maybe. But the prime rate isn't a tool they control directly.

Option J: Income tax, reserve, discount rate. Income tax is Congress, so J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be B: Open-market, discount rate, reserve requirements.

The Federal Reserve System primarily uses three main instruments to control the economy: open-market operations, changes in the discount rate, and adjustments to reserve requirements. Open-market operations involve buying or selling government securities to influence the money supply. The discount rate is the interest rate at which banks borrow directly from the Fed, affecting their lending behavior. Reserve requirements dictate the percentage of deposits banks must hold as reserves, impacting their ability to lend and the money supply. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** includes setting the national budget, which is not a Fed tool.
- **Option B** correctly lists open-market operations, discount rate, and reserve requirements.
- **Option C** mentions tax rates, which are set by Congress.
- **Option D** refers to interest rate adjustments, which may conflate the federal funds rate with the discount rate.
- **Option E** includes capital gains tax, not a Fed tool.
- **Option F** mentions setting exchange rates, which is outside the Fed's control.
- **Option G** includes margin requirements and deposit interest ceilings, which are less central now.
- **Option H** refers to issuing currency and inflation targets, which are not direct tools.
- **Option I** includes the prime rate, which is set by banks, not the Fed.
- **Option J** mentions income tax, which is Congress's responsibility.

The correct answer is **B**, as it accurately reflects the Fed's principal tools.
