Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the concentration of calcium and fluoride ions in a solution of calcium fluoride, CaF₂. Hmm, I remember that CaF₂ is sparingly soluble, so it's a solubility product problem. Right, the Ksp is given as 4.00 × 10^-11. 

Wait, Ksp is the solubility product, which for CaF₂ should be [Ca²+][F⁻]². Because CaF₂ dissociates into one Ca²+ and two F⁻ ions. So, the expression would be Ksp = [Ca²+][F⁻]^2.

The question is asking for the concentrations of each ion. Let me think about how to approach this. Let's denote the solubility of CaF₂ as 's'. So, when CaF₂ dissolves, it produces s moles per liter of Ca²+ and 2s moles per liter of F⁻, right?

So substituting into the Ksp expression: Ksp = (s) * (2s)^2. That should be s*(4s²) = 4s³. And that equals 4.00e-11. So, 4s³ = 4e-11. Hmm, then s³ = 1e-11. Taking cube roots, s = (1e-11)^(1/3). 

Wait, what's the cube root of 1e-11? Let me calculate. 1e-11 is 10^-11. The cube root of 10^-11 is 10^(-11/3). 11 divided by 3 is approximately 3.666..., so 10^-3.666. Let me convert that to a number. 10^-3 is 0.001, and 10^-0.666 is about 0.215. So 0.001 * 0.215 ≈ 0.000215. So s ≈ 2.15e-4 M. But wait, in the options, I don't see exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option D says [Ca²+] =4e-4 and [F⁻]=8e-4. Wait, but wait, if s is around 2e-4, then [Ca²+] is s, which is about 2e-4, and F⁻ is 2s, which would be 4e-4. Hmm, but none of the options exactly match that.

Wait no, let me recalculate. Because if s³ is 1e-11, then s is (1e-11)^(1/3) = (1e-9 * 1e-2)^(1/3) = (1e-9)^(1/3) * (1e-2)^(1/3) = 1e-3 * 1e-2/3. Wait, 1e-2 is 0.01, and cube root of that is approximately 0.215. So 1e-3 is 0.001, times 0.215 is ~0.000215, so 2.15e-4. So s would be approximately 2.15e-4 M.

So then [Ca²+] = s = 2.15e-4 M, [F⁻] = 2s = 4.3e-4 M. Let me look at the options again.

Option D: [Ca²+] =4e-4 (which is 4.00e-4), [F-]=8e-4. Hmm, that's double what I calculated. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let's go through the setup again. CaF₂ dissociates into Ca²+ and 2 F⁻. So if solubility is s, [Ca²+] is s, [F-] is 2s. So Ksp = s*(2s)^2 = 4s^3.

So 4s^3 = 4.00e-11 → s^3 = 1e-11 → s = cube root of 1e-11. Let me compute this more accurately. Cube root of 1e-11.

Wait, 1e-11 is 1 x 10^-11. The cube root of 10^(-11) is 10^(-11/3) = 10^(-3.6667). 10^(-3.6667) is the same as 10^(-3 - 0.6667) → 10^-3 * 10^-0.6667.

10^-3 is 0.001. 10^-0.6667 is approximately 0.215. So 0.001 * 0.215 = 0.000215 M, which is 2.15e-4 M.

So [Ca²+] = 2.15e-4 M, and [F-] = 2*(2.15e-4) )= 4.3e-4 M.

Looking at the options, none exactly match. Let me check the options again.

Option D: [Ca²+] =4.00e-4, [F-]=8.00e-4. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I messed up the exponents. Let me recalculate s.

s^3 = 1e-11 → s = (1e-11)^(1/3) = 1e- (11/3) → 11 divided by 3 is 3 and 2/3 → 3.666... So 1e-3.666 is 2.15443469e-4. So s ≈ 2.154e-4 M.

So [Ca²+] = 2.15e-4 M, [F-] = 4.31e-4 M.

Wait, but looking at the options, is there any that matches this?

Looking at option D: [Ca²+] is 4e-4 M. That's about double my calculation. Did I make a mistake in the setup?

Wait another thought: perhaps I should write the dissolution equation again. CaF₂(s) ⇌ Ca²+ (aq) + 2 F⁻ (aq). So for every mole of CaF₂ that dissolves, you get one mole of Ca²+ and two of F⁻.

So Ksp = [Ca²+][F⁻]^2 = s*(2s)^2 =4 s^3.

So 4 s^3 =4e-11 → s^3 =1e-11 → s=1e-11^(1/3)=1e-3.6667≈ 2.15e-4.

So my calculations seem right.

Looking at the options, none of the options exactly match 2.15e-4 and 4.3e-4.

Wait let me look again.

Option D: [Ca²+] =4.00e-4, [F-]=8.00e-4.

Wait, if [Ca²+] is 4e-4, then s=4e-4. Then F would be 8e-4.

Ksp would be (4e-4)*(8e-4)^2 = 4e-4 * 6.4e-7 → 2.56e-10, which is way larger than 4e-11. So that's not matching.

Option D's Ksp would be 4e-4 * (8e-4)^2 =4e-4 *6.4e-7 = 2.56e-10, which is higher than given.

So that's incorrect.

Wait, option I: [Ca²+] =8e-4, [F-]=1.6e-3. Let's check Ksp: (8e-4)*(1.6e-3)^2=8e-4*(2.56e-6)= 2.05e-9. That's way too big.

Option J: [Ca²+] =5e-4, [F-]=1e-3.

Ksp=5e-4 * (1e-3)^2=5e-4 *1e-6=5e-10. Again, too big.

Option F: [Ca²+] =1.21e-4, [F-]=2.42e-4.

s=1.21e-4. Ksp=1.21e-4*(2.42e-4)^2.

(2.42e-4)^2 is about 5.85e-8. Multiply by 1.21e-4: 1.21e-4 * 5.85e-8 = approx 7.08e-12. That's 7e-12, which is lower than 4e-11. So that's not matching.

Option D is higher than Ksp.

Wait another idea: maybe I made a mistake in the cube root calculation? Let me compute cube of 2e-4.

(2e-4)^3=8e-12. 4*(8e-12)=3.2e-11, which is less than 4e-11. So s would be a bit higher than 2e-4.

Wait, let me solve for s more accurately. s^3 =1e-11 → s= (1e-11)^(1/3). Let's compute it numerically.

1e-11 is 1 x 10^-11. The cube root is 10^(-11/3) = 10^(-3.6666667).

Compute 10^(-3.666667) → 10^(-3) is 0.001, 10^(-0.666667) is approximately 0.2154. So 0.001 * 0.2154 = 0.0002154. So s=2.154e-4 M.

So [Ca²+] =2.154e-4, [F⁻]=4.308e-4.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match. Hmm. Let me check all options.

Option F: [Ca²+] =1.21e-4, [F-]=2.42e-4 → that's about half of what I calculated.

Option D: double of my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp expression. Let me double-check.

Wait, CaF₂ dissociates as Ca²+ + 2 F⁻. So Ksp = [Ca²+][F⁻]^2.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the solution is not as straightforward because CaF₂ is a salt of a weak acid (HF), so the F⁻ might hydrolyze. But wait, I think in pure water, without considering hydrolysis, the initial calculation holds. Since the problem doesn't mention anything else, I think we're supposed to ignore hydrolysis and just use the Ksp expression.

Hmm. So perhaps the closest option would be none, but the options must have the right answer. Let me see again.

Wait, perhaps I should express s in terms of Ksp: s = cube root (Ksp /4).

Because Ksp =4 s³ → s = (Ksp/4)^(1/3).

Ksp is 4e-11 → s = (4e-11 /4)^(1/3) = (1e-11)^(1/3) = same as before, 2.15e-4.

So [Ca²+] is 2.15e-4, [F⁻] is 4.3e-4.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: [Ca²+]=4e-4, [F-]=8e-4 → that's double my s.

Option F: [Ca²+]=1.21e-4, [F-]=2.42e-4 → this is about half of my s.

Wait, maybe I should compute if 2s =4.3e-4 → which would make [F-]=4.3e-4, but none of the options have that.

Looking at the options, perhaps option I: [F-] is 1.6e-3, but that's 4 times higher than my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp expression.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the dissolution equation is CaF₂ → Ca²+ + 2 F⁻. So [Ca²+] is s, [F⁻] is 2s.

So Ksp = s*(2s)^2 =4s³.

So solving for s: s = (Ksp/4)^(1/3).

So Ksp is 4e-11 → s = (4e-11 /4 )^(1/3) → (1e-11)^(1/3) → same as before.

So same result.

Looking again, maybe the closest option is option D, but that's double. Let me see why.

Wait, perhaps the Ksp given was 4.00e-11, and in my calculation, Ksp is 4s³. Let me plug in option D's values to see what Ksp would be.

Option D: [Ca²+]=4.00e-4, [F-]=8.00e-4.

So Ksp =4e-4 * (8e-4)^2 =4e-4 * 6.4e-7 =2.56e-10, which is larger than the given 4e-11. So that's not correct.

Hmm, maybe the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely. Let me check all options.

Option I: [Ca²+] =8e-4, [F-]=1.6e-3.

Ksp would be 8e-4 * (1.6e-3)^2 =8e-4 *2.56e-6=2.05e-9 → nope.

Option G: [Ca²+]=6.84e-4, [F-]=3.42e-4.

Wait, [F-] is 3.42e-4? That would mean 2s=3.42e-4 → s=1.71e-4. Then Ksp =s*(2s)^2=1.71e-4*(3.42e-4)^2.

Compute 3.42e-4 squared: approx 1.17e-7. Multiply by 1.71e-4: 1.71e-4 *1.17e-7 = approx 2e-11. So Ksp=2e-11, which is close to 4e-11? No, it's half of that.

Option D: Ksp=2.56e-10, which is way too big.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should list out all options and compute their Ksp.

Option A: Ca=2e-3, F=4e-3. Ksp=2e-3*(4e-3)^2=2e-3*1.6e-5=3.2e-8 → way too big.

Option B: Ca=2e-4, F=4e-4. Ksp=2e-4*(4e-4)^2=2e-4*(1.6e-7)=3.2e-11 → close to 4e-11.

Wait, 3.2e-11 is less than 4e-11. Hmm, but our calculated Ksp is 4e-11. So 3.2 is lower. Maybe this is possible? Or maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me compute option B's Ksp:

[Ca²+] =2.00e-4, [F-]=4.00e-4.

Ksp=(2e-4) * (4e-4)^2 =2e-4 * 1.6e-7 =3.2e-11.

Which is 3.2e-11, less than 4.0e-11. So that's not matching.

Hmm, but wait our calculation for s was 2.15e-4, so [Ca²+] is about 2.15e-4, which is close to option B's [Ca²+] of 2e-4. But option B's [F-] is 4e-4, which is close to our 4.3e-4.

But the Ksp using option B is 3.2e-11, which is 0.8 times the given Ksp. So perhaps it's a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, but that can't be because its Ksp is higher.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's not possible.

Wait another approach: let me calculate the Ksp of each option and see which is closest.

Given Ksp=4.00e-11.

Option A: Ksp= 3.2e-8 → no.

Option B: 3.2e-11 → 0.8×4e-11.

Option C: Ca=4e-5, F=8e-5 → Ksp=4e-5*(8e-5)^2=4e-5*(6.4e-9)=2.56e-13 → too small.

Option D: 2.56e-10 → too big.

Option E: Ca=1e-3, F=2e-3 → (1e-3)(2e-3)^2 =1e-3 *4e-6=4e-9 → no.

Option F: Ca=1.21e-4, F=2.42e-4 → Ksp=1.21e-4*(2.42e-4)^2=1.21e-4*(5.856e-8)=7.08e-12 → 7e-12, too small.

Option G: Ca=6.84e-4, F=3.42e-4 → Ksp=6.84e-4*(3.42e-4)^2. Let's compute (3.42e-4)^2=1.17e-7. 6.84e-4 *1.17e-7=8.00e-11 → 8e-11, which is close to 4e-11? No, it's double.

Ah, wait, 8e-11 is double of 4e-11.

Option H: Ca=3.42e-4, F=6.84e-4 → Ksp=3.42e-4*(6.84e-4)^2.

(6.84e-4)^2=4.677e-
