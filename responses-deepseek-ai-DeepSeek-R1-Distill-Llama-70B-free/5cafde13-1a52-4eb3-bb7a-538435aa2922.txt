Okay, so I've got this question here about Jinas. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what Jinas are, but I think they might be related to Jainism. I remember that in Jainism, Jinas are like the great teachers or spiritual leaders. The term "Jina" means "conqueror" or "victor," referring to someone who has conquered their own inner enemies like anger and greed.

The question is asking how many Jinas have appeared during our age. Wait, what's meant by "our age"? I think in Jain cosmology, time is divided into cycles, with each cycle having 24 Jinas. So maybe each cycle or era has 24 Jinas. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

I recall that the current era is part of a larger cycle, and each cycle has a certain number of Jinas. The number 24 comes to mind because I think each half of the time cycle has 24 Jinas. So if we're in the current half-cycle, maybe 24 Jinas have appeared so far.

Looking at the options, I see option C is 24. That must be the answer. Let me just double-check. I'm pretty sure there are 24 Jinas in each of the two halves of the cosmic cycle. So during our age, which is one half, it's 24 Jinas.

The answer is based on the understanding that in Jainism, each half of a cosmic cycle has 24 Jinas. Since the question pertains to the current age, which is part of one such half-cycle, the correct number is 24.
