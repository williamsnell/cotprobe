Okay, so I've got this question here about Delia choosing between Harvard and Yale. Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that there are different types of conflicts people face when making decisions. Let me try to think through this.

The question is asking what kind of conflict Delia is experiencing. The options are A through J, each being a different type of conflict.

So, Delia has been accepted to both Harvard and Yale. Both are great schools, so she's probably weighing the pros and cons of each. I think this is a situation where she's torn between two positive options. Both choices have their own benefits, and she has to pick one over the other.

Wait, what's the difference between the conflicts? I remember there's approach-approach, approach-avoidance, and avoidance-avoidance. Let me break them down.

Approach-approach is when you have two positive options and have to choose between them. Like choosing between two things you really want. Approach-avoidance is when you're torn about a single option because it has both positive and negative aspects. For example, taking a job you like but having to move away from family. Avoidance-avoidance is when both options are negative, and you have to pick the lesser of two evils.

In Delia's case, both Harvard and Yale are positive options. She wants to go to both, but she can't. So this must be an approach-approach conflict. Wait, but let me think if any other options fit better.

Looking at the choices again, option G is approach-approach, and option F is approach-avoidance. Since both schools are desirable, it's not approach-avoidance because that's when one option has both pros and cons. So Delia is choosing between two good things, which fits approach-approach.

Wait, but I've also heard of something called cognitive dissonance. That's when you feel discomfort because of conflicting thoughts. Like buying something expensive and then feeling unsure if you made the right choice. But in this case, Delia hasn't made the choice yet; she's just deciding. So maybe it's not cognitive dissonance.

Another option is intrinsic-extrinsic, which relates to motivation sources. Like doing something because you enjoy it (intrinsic) versus doing it for a reward (extrinsic). That doesn't seem to fit here.

Reward-punishment is about choosing between a reward and a punishment, but again, both options here are rewards. So that's not it.

Internal-external conflict is about personal beliefs versus external pressures. Maybe, but the question doesn't specify if she's dealing with external influences or her own desires. It's more about the decision between two positive options.

Frustration-aggression is when you can't reach a goal and get aggressive. Doesn't fit here.

Passive-aggressive is a behavior, not a conflict type. So not that.

Positive-negative could be if one option is positive and the other negative, but both here are positive. So that's not it either.

So after going through all the options, I think the correct answer is approach-approach, which is option G.

Delia is faced with a decision between two positive options, Harvard and Yale, both of which are desirable. This scenario fits the approach-approach conflict, where an individual must choose between two appealing alternatives. 

Answer: G
