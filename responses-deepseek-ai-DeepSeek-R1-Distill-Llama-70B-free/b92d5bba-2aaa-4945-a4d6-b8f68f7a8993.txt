The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A woman went to a nearby supermarket late one night. She parked in the store's parking lot, and while walking toward the building two masked males assaulted and raped her. The lot was poorly lit, had no security personnel, and was frequented by gang members. The police had several incident reports in the past 12 months documenting prior criminal activities, including some personal robberies and assaults, in the lot. The store itself had even more reports than the police. The woman sued the store for her injuries, claiming that it breached its duty to make the premises reasonably safe for its customers. Will she likely prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, the store knew of previous criminal activities but did not take actions to prevent them.
B: No, the store owes no special duty of care to eliminate crime on the parking lot; it was up to the police to perform that task.
C: Yes, a store has a duty to protect its customers from all forms of harm.
D: No, the store cannot be held responsible for the actions of a third party.
E: No, the store cannot predict or prevent all possible criminal activities.
F: No, the occurrence of a rape of a customer was not a foreseeable event and the store had no duty to try and discover that such a potential danger could exist.
G: Yes, a store owner is the guarantor to every customer that he or she will be protected and safe when walking in the parking lot.
H: Yes, the store failed in its duty to provide adequate security measures.
I: No, the woman should have taken measures to protect herself.
J: Yes, a business will be liable for known conditions in the building or adjoining parking areas that are a danger to the personal safety and security of its customers.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a woman suing a store after being assaulted and raped in their parking lot. The question is whether she will likely prevail, meaning win her case. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that in premises liability cases, businesses have a duty to maintain their premises in a reasonably safe condition for customers. This includes both the store itself and areas like parking lots that customers use. So the store probably has some responsibility here.

The scenario says the parking lot was poorly lit, had no security, and was known to have gang members. Plus, there were prior incidents reported both to the police and the store. That seems like a lot of prior notice, which is important because it shows the store knew or should have known about potential dangers.

I think the key here is foreseeability. If similar crimes have happened before, the store should have anticipated that more could occur. So they should take reasonable steps to prevent them, like improving lighting, hiring security, or installing cameras. If they didn't, they might have breached their duty.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because the store knew of previous activities and didn't act. That makes sense because knowing about prior crimes creates a duty to take measures.

Option B says no, arguing the store's duty is not to eliminate crime but that's up to the police. But I think businesses are expected to take reasonable steps, not that they replace the police.

Option C says yes, duty to protect from all harm. That seems too broad. They can't protect against every possible harm, just what's foreseeable.

Option D says no, because it's a third party's actions. But in premises liability, if the business didn't take steps to prevent foreseeable third-party crimes, they can be liable.

Option E says no, can't prevent all crime. But the issue is whether they took reasonable steps, not all possible.

Option F says no, rape wasn't foreseeable. But given prior assaults and robberies, it might be considered foreseeable.

Option G claims the store is a guarantor of safety, which seems too strict.

Option H says yes, failed to provide adequate security. That aligns with what I was thinking about taking reasonable measures.

Option I says no, she should have protected herself. But the duty is on the business, not the customer, unless contributory negligence applies, which might not be the main issue here.

Option J says yes, liable for known dangers in the area. This seems correct too, as the store knew about the conditions.

So, the main points are prior incidents, foreseeability, and the store's duty to take reasonable measures. So options A, H, and J are contenders.

I think the best answer is A or J. J states that the business is liable for known dangers in the building or adjoining areas. Since the parking lot is adjoining and the dangers were known, J sounds correct.

Wait, but A is also correct because it's about knowing and not acting. Hmm. Which one is more accurate legally?

In premises liability, the duty arises when the owner knows or should know of a dangerous condition. So if prior incidents show that, the store has a duty to act. So both A and H touch on this. But the options are a bit different.

Option J says "known conditions" which covers the prior incidents. So the answer is likely J.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about the store's duty. So if the store had multiple reports, they had actual knowledge. Therefore, their failure to act would be a breach of duty. So A and J both could be correct, but perhaps J is broader.

Alternatively, H says they failed to provide adequate security measures, which is also correct because poor lighting and lack of security are part of the problem.

I'm a bit torn between A, H, and J. But I think the correct answer is A because it directly addresses the store's knowledge and failure to act, which is the core issue here. Alternatively, J is also a good option because it's about known dangers in the area.

Wait, maybe J is more precise. Let me recall cases I've studied. In cases where a business has a parking lot with a history of crime, courts have held them liable for failing to provide adequate security measures, such as lighting or guards. So J says the business is liable for known conditions that are dangers. That fits here because the store knew about the prior incidents and the dangerous conditions (poor lighting, etc.) in their parking lot.

So I think the correct answer is J, but I'm a little confused because A and H also seem correct.

Alternatively, another approach: the issue is whether the store had a duty. Since they knew about prior crimes, the duty arose, and they didn't take steps, so they breached that duty. So yes, she would prevail. So the correct answer would be either A, H, or J.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Yes, store knew and didn't act.

H: Yes, failed to provide security.

J: Yes, liable for known dangers.

In the context of premises liability, the duty is to take reasonable steps when they know or should know of a danger. So J captures that because the parking lot conditions (poor lighting, etc.) and the prior crimes are known dangers.

So the best answer is J.

The woman is suing the store for breaching its duty to maintain a reasonably safe premises, including the parking lot. In premises liability, businesses have a duty to protect customers from foreseeable dangers. The store had prior knowledge of criminal activities, including assaults and robberies, and the parking lot was poorly lit with no security. These factors indicate that the store should have anticipated potential dangers and taken reasonable measures to mitigate them, such as improving lighting or hiring security. The store's failure to act despite known risks constitutes a breach of duty.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** correctly identifies that the store knew of prior criminal activities and failed to act, which supports the woman's claim.
- **Option H** highlights the store's failure to provide adequate security measures, aligning with the duty to address foreseeable risks.
- **Option J** emphasizes liability for known dangers in the premises or adjoining areas, which fits the scenario as the store knew about the dangerous conditions in the parking lot.

While all three options (A, H, J) are plausible, **Option J** is the most precise because it directly addresses the store's liability for known dangers in the parking lot, which is central to the case.

Answer: J
