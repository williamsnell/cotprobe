Okay, so I've got this equation here: −17.02 equals −2.3 times y. I need to solve for y and then check my answer. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

Alright, the equation is -17.02 = -2.3y. I remember that to solve for y, I should isolate it. That means I need to get rid of the coefficient in front of y, which is -2.3. 

The way to do that is by dividing both sides of the equation by -2.3. So I'll take -17.02 and divide it by -2.3. Wait, dividing two negative numbers should give a positive result, right? So the negatives will cancel out.

Let me write that down step by step. Starting with:

-17.02 = -2.3y

Divide both sides by -2.3:

y = (-17.02) / (-2.3)

Now, the negatives cancel, so:

y = 17.02 / 2.3

Hmm, I need to compute 17.02 divided by 2.3. Let me think about how to do this division. Maybe I can simplify the numbers to make it easier.

Wait, 2.3 times 7 is 16.1, because 2.3 * 7: 2*7 is 14, 0.3*7 is 2.1, so 14 + 2.1 = 16.1. That's less than 17.02. So 7 times 2.3 is 16.1. The difference between 17.02 and 16.1 is 0.92.

So now I have 0.92 left to divide by 2.3. Let's see, 2.3 goes into 0.92 how many times? Hmm, maybe 0.4 times because 2.3 * 0.4 is 0.92 exactly. Let me check: 2.3 * 0.4 = 0.92. Yep, that's right.

So adding that up, 7 + 0.4 equals 7.4. So y should be 7.4. Wait, but let me double-check that because sometimes I make calculation mistakes.

Let me multiply 2.3 by 7.4 to see if I get back to 17.02. So 2.3 * 7 is 16.1, and 2.3 * 0.4 is 0.92. Adding 16.1 and 0.92 gives 17.02. Perfect, that matches the left side of the equation. So y equals 7.4.

Looking at the options, E is 7.4. So I think the correct answer is E.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake with the signs. The original equation had both sides negative, so when I divide them, the result should be positive. Yep, that's correct. So no issue there.

Another way to check is to plug the value back into the equation. So if y is 7.4, then -2.3 times 7.4 should equal -17.02. Let me calculate that.

-2.3 * 7.4: First, 2.3 * 7 is 16.1, and 2.3 * 0.4 is 0.92. So 16.1 + 0.92 is 17.02. So with the negative, it's -17.02, which matches the left side. So yes, that's correct.

I think I'm confident that E is the right answer here.

To solve the equation −17.02 = −2.3y, we isolate y by dividing both sides by −2.3:

\[
y = \frac{-17.02}{-2.3}
\]

The negatives cancel out, simplifying to:

\[
y = \frac{17.02}{2.3}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
2.3 \times 7.4 = 17.02
\]

Thus, \( y = 7.4 \). To verify, substitute \( y = 7.4 \) back into the original equation:

\[
-2.3 \times 7.4 = -17.02
\]

This confirms the solution is correct. Among the options, the correct answer is:

**E: 7.4**
