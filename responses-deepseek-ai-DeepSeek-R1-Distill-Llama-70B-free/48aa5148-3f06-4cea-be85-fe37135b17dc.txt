Okay, so I need to figure out which of the given options is a renewable energy source. Let me start by recalling what renewable energy sources are. From what I remember, renewable energy comes from natural resources that can be replenished over time, like sunlight, wind, water, and biomass. Non-renewable sources, on the other hand, take millions of years to form and are finite, such as fossil fuels.

Looking at the options provided:

A: Oil shale. Hmm, oil shale is a type of sedimentary rock that contains kerogen, which can be burned for energy. I think it's considered a fossil fuel, so probably non-renewable.

B: Wood. Wait, wood is biomass. Trees can be replanted and regrown, so it's renewable if managed properly. That makes sense.

C: Natural gas. Definitely a fossil fuel, non-renewable.

D: Oil. Another fossil fuel, so non-renewable.

E: Peat. Peat is an accumulation of partially decayed plant matter, often used as fuel. I've heard it's considered a slow-renewable resource, but some classify it as non-renewable because it takes a long time to form. I'm a bit unsure here, but I think it's more on the non-renewable side.

F: Diesel. That's a refined product from oil, so non-renewable.

G: Gasoline. Same as diesel, derived from oil, non-renewable.

H: Propane. Another fossil fuel byproduct, so non-renewable.

I: Coal. Fossil fuel, non-renewable.

J: Uranium. Used in nuclear energy, which is not renewable because uranium is a finite resource.

So the only option that stands out as renewable is B: Wood, since it's a biomass resource that can be replenished relatively quickly compared to fossil fuels.

The renewable energy source from the options provided is wood, as it is a biomass resource that can be replenished over time. 

Answer: B
