Question:

A mail clerk domiciled in State A slipped and fell on ice that had formed near the loading dock of the building in State B where the clerk's State B employer leased space for its headquarters. The building was owned and operated by a State C corporation. As a result of the fall, the clerk was injured and the employer's expensive computer he was carrying was badly damaged. The clerk sued the building owner for negligence in a federal district court in State B, seeking $100,000 in personal-injury damages. The employer has filed a timely motion to intervene, asserting an $80,000 negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer. Is the court likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene?

Options:

A: No, because the employer cannot intervene in a personal injury case.
B: No, because the employer's claim is not directly related to the clerk's personal injury claim.
C: Yes, because the employer also has a direct negligence claim against the building owner.
D: No, because although the employer has an interest in the clerk's action, that interest is not likely to be impaired in the employer's absence.
E: Yes, because the employer has a financial interest in the outcome of the clerk's case.
F: No, because the employer's claim exceeds the amount the clerk is seeking in damages.
G: Yes, because the employer is an indispensable party.
H: Yes, because the employer's claim and the clerk's claim arose from the same incident.
I: Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.
J: No, because the clerk chose not to join the employer as a co-plaintiff in his action.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about intervention in a federal court case. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the scenario is a mail clerk from State A who was injured in State B. The building where he was working is owned by a State C corporation. The clerk sued the building owner in federal district court in State B for negligence, seeking $100k in damages. Now, the employer wants to intervene, claiming $80k in damages for the computer that was damaged when the clerk fell.

The question is whether the court will grant the employer's motion to intervene. The options are from A to J.

First, I remember that intervention is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24. There are two types: intervention as of right and permissive intervention. 

Intervention as of right (Rule 24(a)) allows a party to intervene if they have a legal interest in the matter, the case could impair their ability to protect that interest, and their interest isn't adequately represented by existing parties. If these are met, the court must allow intervention.

Permissive intervention (Rule 24(b)) is at the court's discretion and usually when there's a common question of law or fact. But the court can decide whether to allow it.

So, looking at the employer's situation: they have an $80k claim for the damaged computer. The clerk's case is about personal injury, and the employer is suing for property damage. Both are suing the same defendant, the building owner, for the same incident.

I think the key here is whether the employer's claim shares common questions of law or fact with the clerk's case. The incident is the same, so the negligence claim would involve similar issues. Also, the employer's interest is in the computer damage, which is tied to the same slip and fall incident as the clerk's injury.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says no because employer can't intervene in a personal injury case. But I don't think that's a rule. Personal injury cases can have intervenors if their claims are related.

Option B: No, because the employer's claim isn't directly related. But I think they are related because same incident, same defendant, same negligence claim.

Option C: Yes, because employer has a direct negligence claim. That sounds right because the employer can sue for the damage to their property, which is a direct claim.

Option D: No, because the employer's interest isn't impaired. Wait, the clerk is suing for personal injury, and the employer is suing for property damage. If the clerk's case affects the employer's ability to recover, maybe. But I think the employer's interest is separate. But I'm not sure. The clerk's case might not address the property damage, so the employer's interest could be impaired if they don't intervene. So maybe D is not correct.

Option E: Yes, because employer has a financial interest. It's true, but Rule 24(a) requires more than just a financial interest; it has to be a legal interest that might be impaired.

Option F: No, because the employer's claim is less than the clerk's. But amount doesn't matter; the rule isn't about the amount but the nature of the claim.

Option G: Yes, because employer is an indispensable party. Indispensable parties are under Rule 19, not Rule 24. So this is about intervention, not indispensability. So G is probably not correct.

Option H: Yes, because same incident. While that's true, it's more about whether the claims share common questions, which is more about permissive intervention.

Option I: Yes, because common questions of law and fact. This aligns with permissive intervention under Rule 24(b). But is it as of right or permissive? If the employer meets Rule 24(a), they can intervene as of right.

Wait, does the employer have a legal interest that could be impaired? The employer's claim is for property damage, a separate issue from the clerk's personal injury. But if the clerk's case goes to judgment, could that affect the employer's ability to sue? Maybe if the court in the clerk's case makes a determination on some issue that's also relevant to the employer's case, like the building owner's negligence. If the clerk loses, maybe the employer's case is impacted. So the employer's interest in ensuring that the building owner is found negligent is at stake. So maybe they have a sufficient legal interest.

Alternatively, if the clerk settles, does that affect the employer? I'm not sure, but I think the employer's interest is in being able to pursue their own claim, so their interest is their right to recover for the computer. If the clerk's case doesn't address that, the employer's interest isn't impaired, but maybe they can still intervene permissively.

So, under Rule 24(a), the employer needs to show that their interest may be impaired. If the clerk's case could resolve issues that affect the employer's claim, then yes. But if the clerk's case is only about personal injury, perhaps the employer's claim isn't directly affected. So maybe the employer can't intervene as of right. But then, under permissive, because of common questions, the court might allow it.

Looking at the options, option C says yes because employer has a direct negligence claim. That makes sense because the employer can sue the building owner directly for negligence in maintaining the premises, leading to the damage. So that's a valid claim, so the employer would have a direct cause of action, making intervention appropriate.

Option I says yes because common questions. That also seems correct, but whether it's as of right or permissive. If the employer can show that they meet the criteria for intervention as of right, then option C would apply.

Wait, but I think the employer's claim is a separate and distinct cause of action, even though it arises from the same incident. So, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the elements of intervention as of right.

Rule 24(a)(2) requires that the applicant must show that their interest may be impaired or that they have a claim that shares with the main action's subject matter.

In this case, the employer's claim is against the same defendant for the same incident but a different harm. So, perhaps the employer's interest in ensuring that the defendant is found negligent could be affected if the clerk's case is lost. So the employer's ability to recover might be impaired if the clerk doesn't prove negligence, but that might not necessarily be the case because the employer could present their own evidence.

Alternatively, perhaps the employer doesn't have an interest that's directly tied to the clerk's case. So maybe intervention isn't as of right, but permissive.

But looking at the answer options, option C is about having a direct negligence claim. The employer does have a direct claim, but whether that's enough for intervention.

Alternatively, option I says yes because of common questions. So the employer's claim shares common questions about the defendant's negligence, like whether the ice was a dangerous condition, whether the defendant should have known, etc.

I think the correct answer is C or I. Now, looking at the options again, option C is about a direct negligence claim, which the employer has. But in terms of intervention, it's about whether the employer meets the criteria under Rule 24.

Wait, the clerk is suing for personal injury, and the employer for property damage. Both are suing the same defendant for the same incident. So they share a common question of whether the defendant was negligent, which is a question of law and fact common to both. So permissive intervention is possible, but the question is whether the court is likely to grant it.

The options are about whether intervention is granted. The employer's motion is timely, so that's a factor.

Option C suggests that the employer can intervene because they have a direct claim. I think that's correct because their claim is viable and separate, but intervention allows them to join the existing case.

Wait, but Rule 24(a) requires more than just having a claim; it requires that the claim shares a common question or that the applicant's interest would be impaired.

Alternatively, I think the employer's claim is sufficiently related to the clerk's, so the court is likely to grant permissive intervention under Rule 24(b). But the question is about whether the court is likely to grant the motion.

Looking at the options again: option C is about having a direct claim. Option I is about common questions.

If the employer can show that their claim arises from the same transaction or occurrence and shares common questions, then permissive intervention is appropriate.

But the clerk's case is about personal injury, and the employer's is about property damage. But the underlying issue is the same—whether the building owner was negligent in maintaining the premises. So yes, common questions.

So the court might allow intervention because of the common questions, making option I a possible correct answer.

Alternatively, the employer's interest in ensuring that the building owner is found negligent could be at risk if the clerk's case doesn't establish negligence. So maybe under Rule 24(a), the employer can intervene as of right because their interest (ability to recover) could be impaired.

Hmm. So the key is whether the employer's interest is such that it would be impaired without intervention. If the clerk's case doesn't address the property damage, then the employer's claim isn't directly affected. But the clerk's case could result in a judgment that the defendant was not negligent, which would impair the employer's ability to sue. So in that sense, the employer's interest is at risk.

Therefore, under Rule 24(a), the employer might be able to intervene as a matter of right because their ability to pursue their own claim might be impaired if the clerk's case results in a judgment against the clerk, potentially affecting the employer's case.

So, the employer's interest is in ensuring that the defendant's negligence is established, which is the same issue in both cases. If the clerk loses, the employer might have a harder time proving negligence in their own case.

Therefore, the court is likely to grant intervention, either because the employer has a direct claim (option C) or because there are common questions (option I).

But which option is correct? Looking at the answer options, option I states that the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action. That's true because both are alleging negligence arising from the same incident.

So I'm leaning towards option I being the correct answer. Alternatively, option C is about the direct claim, which the employer does have.

Wait, but the question is about whether the court is likely to grant the motion. So if the employer meets the criteria for intervention as of right, the court must grant it. Otherwise, permissive is discretionary.

In this case, the employer's interest is in ensuring that the defendant is found negligent, which is a key issue in both cases. If the clerk's case is decided without the employer, and the clerk loses, that could impair the employer's ability to recover. So the employer's interest is at risk, meeting the criteria for intervention as of right.

Therefore, option C might not be the exact reason, but option I could be under permissive. Alternatively, the employer might argue that their interest is impaired, so they can intervene as of right.

Wait, but another point: the clerk is suing for personal injury, and the employer for property damage. Are their claims so closely related that the employer's interest would be impaired without intervention? Or are they separate enough that the employer's interest isn't directly affected?

I think the clerk's case could potentially result in a judgment that the defendant wasn't negligent, which would make it harder for the employer to prove negligence in their own case. So the employer's interest is that the defendant's negligence is established, and without intervention, that might not happen. So the employer's interest could be impaired.

Therefore, the court is likely to grant intervention because the employer's interest may be impaired, and because they have a direct claim.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option C says yes because the employer has a direct negligence claim. That's a valid point. So the employer can sue the building owner directly, so they have a cause of action, which is separate from the clerk's. So perhaps the court would allow intervention as of right because the employer's interest is impaired and they have a direct claim.

Alternatively, the court might allow it under permissive intervention because of common questions.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of what each option is saying.

Option I: Yes, because common questions. That would be permissive, but the court may grant it.

Option C: Yes, because direct claim. That would imply intervention as of right.

Which is more applicable here? I think the employer has a direct claim, so they can intervene as of right under Rule 24(a). Therefore, option C would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, if the court decides it's permissive, option I would be correct, but the question is about whether the court is likely to grant it, and I think the employer meets the criteria for intervention as of right.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me check the elements of Rule 24(a):

1. The application is timely.
2. The applicant has a sufficient interest in the subject matter.
3. The interest may be impaired or affected by the disposition of the case.

In this case, the employer's interest is in recovering for the damaged computer. Their interest could be impaired if the clerk's case results in a judgment that the defendant wasn't negligent, which would affect the employer's case. So the employer's interest is at risk.

Therefore, the court is likely to grant intervention under Rule 24(a), making option C correct because the employer has a direct negligence claim against the building owner.

So the answer should be C.
</think>

To determine whether the court is likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene, we must analyze the criteria for intervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24. There are two types of intervention: intervention as of right (Rule 24(a)) and permissive intervention (Rule 24(b)). 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Rule 24(a) - Intervention as of Right**:  
   - The employer must show:  
     - A timely application.  
     - A sufficient legal interest in the matter.  
     - That their interest may be impaired or affected by the disposition of the case.  
   - The employer has a direct negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer, which arises from the same incident as the clerk's personal injury claim. The employer's interest in ensuring the building owner is found negligent could be impaired if the clerk's case results in a judgment that the building owner was not negligent. This impairment makes intervention as of right appropriate under Rule 24(a).

2. **Rule 24(b) - Permissive Intervention**:  
   - Permissive intervention is discretionary and typically applies when the proposed claim shares common questions of law or fact with the existing case.  
   - Both the clerk's personal injury claim and the employer's property damage claim hinge on whether the building owner was negligent in maintaining the premises. This shared issue of negligence creates common questions of law and fact, making permissive intervention appropriate under Rule 24(b).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The employer can intervene in a personal injury case if their claim is related and meets the criteria for intervention.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The employer's claim is directly related to the same incident and shares common questions of law and fact.  
- **Option C**: Correct. The employer has a direct negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer, satisfying the criteria for intervention as of right under Rule 24(a).  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The employer's interest in ensuring the building owner's negligence is established could be impaired if the clerk's case results in a judgment against the clerk.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. While the employer has a financial interest, Rule 24(a) requires more than just a financial interest; it requires a legal interest that may be impaired.  
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The amount of damages sought is irrelevant to the decision to grant intervention.  
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The employer is not an indispensable party under Rule 19; this is a question of intervention under Rule 24.  
- **Option H**: Incorrect. While the claims arose from the same incident, this alone does not automatically grant intervention as of right.  
- **Option I**: Plausible. The employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's claim, making permissive intervention appropriate under Rule 24(b). However, intervention as of right under Rule 24(a) is more directly applicable here.  
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The clerk's decision not to join the employer as a co-plaintiff does not preclude the employer from intervening.

### Conclusion:
The employer meets the criteria for intervention as of right under Rule 24(a) because they have a direct negligence claim and their interest may be impaired by the disposition of the clerk's case. While permissive intervention under Rule 24(b) is also plausible, the stronger basis for granting the motion is the employer's direct claim. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Yes, because the employer also has a direct negligence claim against the building owner.**
