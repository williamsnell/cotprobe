Okay, so I have this problem about finding the enthalpy of vaporization of ethylene at its normal boiling point, which is given as -103.9°C. The question provides an equation for the vapor pressure as a function of temperature, and I need to use that to calculate the enthalpy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

Alright, I remember that the enthalpy of vaporization (ΔHvap) can be found using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The equation relates the vapor pressure of a liquid to the temperature. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is usually written as ln(P) = -ΔHvap/(R T) + C, where C is a constant. But wait, sometimes it's expressed in terms of log base 10 instead of natural log. Oh right, the equation given here uses log base 10, so I'll need to adjust accordingly.

The given equation is log P = - (834.13 / T) + 1.75 log T - 8.375e-3 T + 5.3234. Hmm, that looks a bit more complicated than the standard Clausius-Clapeyron form. I think I need to manipulate this equation to get it into a form where I can extract ΔHvap.

Wait, the standard Clausius-Clapeyron equation can be written in terms of log base 10 as log P = (-ΔHvap)/(2.303 R T) + (ΔSvap)/R + other terms? Or maybe I should consider integrating the Clausius equation. Oh wait, another approach: The general form when using log is log P = (-ΔHvap)/(2.303 R T) + C, but that seems too simplistic compared to the given equation. So maybe the given equation is an Antoine-type equation, which is more accurate but includes more terms.

The Antoine equation is usually log P = A - B/(T + C), but the given equation here has more terms. Oh well, perhaps I can take the derivative of log P with respect to (1/T) to find ΔHvap. Because I remember that the slope of log P vs 1/T is related to the enthalpy of vaporization.

So, let's think about the standard approach. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation in differential form is d(ln P)/dT = ΔHvap/(R T²). If I multiply both sides by RT², I get ΔHvap = R T² d(ln P)/dT. But since the given equation uses log base 10, I should convert d(ln P) to d(log P) multiplied by 2.303.

Wait, let's see: ln P = 2.303 log P. So, d(ln P) = 2.303 d(log P). Therefore, substituting into the equation, we have:

d(ln P)/dT = (2.303 d(log P)/dT) = ΔHvap/(R T²)

So, rearranging,

ΔHvap = (2.303 R T²) * (d(log P)/dT)

So I need to compute the derivative of log P with respect to T, evaluate it at the normal boiling point, and then plug into this formula.

But wait, the normal boiling point is when the vapor pressure equals standard atmospheric pressure, which is 1 atm. But in the given equation, do I know what units the pressure is in? The problem doesn't specify, but I'll assume that the equation is set so that at the boiling point, log P is zero (since 1 atm is 10^0). Hmm, but maybe I should check what T is at the normal boiling point.

Wait, the normal boiling point is given as -103.9°C, which is 169.25 K (since 273.15 - 103.9 = 169.25 K). So T = 169.25 K.

So, the first step is to compute d(log P)/dT at T = 169.25 K.

Given log P = - (834.13 / T) + 1.75 log T - 8.375e-3 T + 5.3234.

Let me compute the derivative term by term.

The derivative of log P with respect to T is:

d(log P)/dT = d/dT [ -834.13 / T ] + d/dT [1.75 log T ] + d/dT [ -8.375e-3 T ] + d/dT [5.3234 ]

Calculating each term:

1. d/dT [ -834.13 / T ] = 834.13 / T²

2. d/dT [1.75 log T ] = 1.75 * (1/T) * (1/ln 10) )? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative of log T (base 10) with respect to T is 1/(T ln 10). So 1.75 * (1/(T ln 10)).

3. d/dT [ -8.375e-3 T ] = -8.375e-3

4. The derivative of a constant (5.3234) is zero.

So putting it all together:

d(log P)/dT = (834.13 / T²) + (1.75)/(T ln 10) - 8.375e-3

Now, I need to evaluate this at T = 169.25 K.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: 834.13 / T².

T = 169.25 K. T squared is (169.25)^2.

Let me compute 169^2 = 28561, 0.25^2=0.0625, and cross terms 2*169*0.25 = 84.5. So (169.25)^2 = (169 + 0.25)^2 = 169² + 2*169*0.25 + 0.25² = 28561 + 84.5 + 0.0625 = 28645.5625.

So first term: 834.13 / 28645.5625 = let's compute that.

834.13 / 28645.56 ≈ 0.02913 (approximately).

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

28645.5625 is about 2.86455625e4.

834.13 / 2.86455625e4 = approximately 0.02913, yes.

Second term: 1.75 / (T ln 10 )

T is 169.25, ln(10) is approximately 2.302585.

So denominator: 169.25 * 2.302585 ≈ let's compute that.

169.25 * 2 = 338.5, 169.25 * 0.302585 ≈ 51.2 (since 170 *0.3=51, so a bit less). Let me compute 169.25 * 0.302585:

0.3 *169.25 = 50.775; 0.002585 *169.25 ≈ 0.438. So total is approx 50.775 +0.438 = 51.213. So 338.5 +51.213= 389.713.

So denominator is ~389.713.

So the second term is 1.75 / 389.713 ≈ 0.004495.

Third term: -8.375e-3 = -0.008375.

So putting all together, the derivative is:

0.02913 + 0.004495 -0.008375 = Let's add them.

0.02913 + 0.004495 = 0.033625. Then subtract 0.008375: 0.033625 - 0.008375 = 0.02525.

So d(log P)/dT ≈ 0.02525.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations for any possible errors.

Wait, 834.13 / (169.25)^2: 169.25^2 = 169.25 *169.25.

Wait, 170^2 is 28900. Subtract (0.75)^2 and the cross term: (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2, where a=170, b=0.75.

So 170^2 = 28900, 2ab = 2*170*0.75=255, b^2=0.75^2=0.5625.

So (170 -0.75)^2 = 28900 -255 +0.5625 = 28645.5625. So correct.

So 834.13 / 28645.5625 = let me compute 834.13 /28645.56.

Well, 28645.56 * 0.029 = 28645.56 *0.03 is 859.3668, but 0.029 is 0.03 minus 0.001. So 859.3668 -28.64556 = 830.7212. So 0.029 *28645.56 = ~830.72.

But 834.13 is a bit higher. So 830.72 is 0.029, so 834.13-830.72= 3.41 remaining. 3.41 /28645.56≈0.000119. So total is approx 0.029 + 0.000119 ≈0.029119.

So yeah, approximately 0.02912.

Second term: 1.75 / (169.25 * ln10). Let me compute 169.25 * 2.302585.

Compute 170 *2.302585=391.439 (because 2.302585 *100=230.2585; 70*2.302585= 161.18095; so 170 is 230.2585 + 161.18095=391.43945). But since it's 169.25, which is 170 - 0.75.

So 169.25 *2.302585 = 391.43945 - (0.75 *2.302585) = 391.43945 - 1.72694 ≈ 389.7125.

So denominator is 389.7125. 1.75 / 389.7125 = let's compute.

1.75 /389.7125 → same as 7/ (4 *389.7125) → wait, maybe just compute it.

389.7125 * 0.0045 = approx 1.753. So 1.75 is approx 0.004495.

So yes, about 0.004495.

Third term is -0.008375.

Adding up: 0.02912 +0.004495 = 0.033615; subtract 0.008375 gives 0.02524.

So d(log P)/dT ≈ 0.02524.

Now, using the equation:

ΔHvap = 2.303 * R * T^2 * (d(log P)/dT)

Wait, R is the gas constant. What's R in appropriate units? Since the pressure is in what units? The equation gives log P, but I'm not told the units. Hmm, but in the Clausius equation, pressure should be in terms of atmospheres, as standard. But wait, the normal boiling point is when P=1 atm. So I can proceed under the assumption that P is in atm.

Wait, but actually, the units for R depend on the units of pressure. R is commonly 8.314 J/mol·K when using P in Pascals, but if P is in atm, R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K. Hmm, but wait, in the equation, the units of the terms must be consistent. Let me think.

Wait, but in the expression for ΔHvap, the units come out in J/mol, right? Because R is 8.314 J/mol·K, so when multiplied by T in K and squared, and the derivative, which is dimensionless, the result is in J/mol.

So, R = 8.314 J/mol·K.

So, putting it all together:

ΔHvap = 2.303 * 8.314 * (169.25)^2 * 0.02524.

Compute each part step by step.

First, compute 2.303 * 8.314.

2.303 *8 = 18.424, 2.303 *0.314≈0.722. So total approx 19.146.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

8.314 *2.303.

Compute 8 *2.303 =18.424.

0.314 *2.303: Let's compute 0.3 *2.303=0.6909, 0.014 *2.303=0.03224. So 0.6909 +0.03224=0.72314.

So 18.424 + 0.72314 =19.14714.

So 19.147 J/mol·K.

Next, compute (169.25)^2 =28645.56 K².

So, 19.147 * 28645.56 = let me compute that.

First, 20 *28645.56 =572,911.2.

But it's 19.147, so 20 -0.853.

So 19.147 *28645.56 = (20 -0.853) *28645.56 = 20*28645.56 - 0.853*28645.56.

20*28645.56 =572911.2.

0.853 *28645.56: Let's compute 0.8 *28645.56 =22,916.448. 0.05 *28645.56 =1,432.278. 0.003 *28645.56 ≈85.9367.

Wait, 0.853 is 0.8 +0.05 +0.003. So summing:

22,916.448 +1,432.278=24,348.726; +85.9367=24,434.6627.

So 0.853 *28645.56 ≈24,434.66.

So 20*28645.56 is 572,911.2, minus 24,434.66 is 572,911.2 -24,434.66= 548,476.54.

So 19.147 *28645.56 ≈548,476.54 J·K/mol.

Wait, no, wait, the units would be J/mol*K * K² = J·K/mol.

Wait, actually, the calculation is 2.303 * R * T^2, so units are (unitless) * (J/mol·K) * K² → J/mol.

Wait, no, R is J/(mol·K), T is K, so T squared is K². So 2.303 * R * T² → unitless * (J/(mol·K)) * K² → J/mol.

So, 19.147 J/(mol·K) * 28645.56 K² → 19.147 *28645.56 = 548,476 J/mol.

Wait, but that's 548,476 J/mol, which is 548.476 kJ/mol.

Wait, no, wait, 19.147 is in J/(mol·K), and T squared is K², so 19.147 * T² → (J/(mol·K)) * K² → J/mol. Correct.

So 19.147 *28645.56 = 548,476 J/mol → 548.476 kJ/mol.

Now, multiply this by the derivative (d(log P)/dT) which is 0.02524.

So 548.476 kJ/mol * 0.02524 = let's compute that.

0.025 *548.476 =13.7119.

0.00024 *548.476 = approx 0.1315.

So total approx 13.7119 +0.1315=13.8434 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's about 13.84 kJ/mol. But wait, looking at the options, the closest is option E:13.838 kJ/mol^-1.

But wait, let me be precise with the calculation.

Compute 548,476 J/mol * 0.02524:

First, 548476 * 0.02524.

Compute step by step.

Multiply 548,476 * 0.02 =10,969.52.

Multiply 548,476 *0.005=2,742.38.

Multiply 548,476 *0.00024=131.534.

Add them together:10,969.52 +2,742.38 =13,711.90 +131.534=13,843.434 J/mol.

13,843.434 J/mol is 13.843 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option E is 13.838 kJ/mol^-1, which is very close. Hmm, slight discrepancy due to rounding during calculations. So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because that's a lot of steps and it's easy to make a mistake.

Wait, let's recompute the derivative more accurately.

d(log P)/dT = 834.13 / T² + (1.75)/(T ln10) - 0.008375.

With T=169.25 K.

Compute each term:

Term 1: 834.13 / (169.25)^2.

(169.25)^2 = 28645.5625.

834.13 /28645.5625 = let me compute 83413 /286455625 → wait, perhaps better to use decimal division.

28645.5625 * 0.029 = 830.7206.

The difference between 834.13 and 830.7206 is 3.4094.

So 3.4094 /28645.5625 ≈ 0.000119.

So term1=0.029119.

Term2: 1.75 / (169.25 * ln10).

169.25 * ln10 = 169.25 *2.302585.

Compute 170 *2.302585=391.43945.

Subtract 0.75 *2.302585=1.72694.

So 391.43945-1.72694=389.71251.

Then, 1.75 / 389.71251 → let me compute that.

1.75 ÷389.71251 ≈ approximately 0.004494.

Term3: -0.008375.

So sum: 0.029119 +0.004494=0.033613 → 0.033613 -0.008375=0.025238.

So d(log P)/dT=≈0.025238.

Then, ΔHvap=2.303 * R * T² * 0.025238.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So,
