Okay, so I've got this physics problem about an athlete whirling a discus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on rotational motion, but let's see if I can figure this out. Alright, the problem says the discus is moving in a circle with a radius of 80.0 cm. Oh wait, I should convert that to meters because the answer needs to be in m/s². So 80 cm is 0.8 meters. Got that.

At a certain instant, the angular velocity is 10.0 rad/s, and the angular acceleration is 50.0 rad/s². I remember that acceleration in circular motion has two components: centripetal and tangential. Right, the total acceleration is the vector sum of these two. But since the question asks for the magnitude, I can just calculate each component separately and then add them using Pythagoras' theorem.

Wait, let me think about the formulas. Centripetal acceleration is a_c = r * ω², and tangential acceleration is a_t = r * α. Oh yeah, because angular acceleration α is the rate of change of angular velocity.

So first, I'll calculate the centripetal acceleration. Plugging in the numbers: a_c = 0.8 m * (10 rad/s)². Let's compute that. 10 squared is 100. Multiply by 0.8 gives 80 m/s². Okay, that's straightforward.

Next, the tangential acceleration. Using a_t = r * α. So that's 0.8 m * 50 rad/s². 50 times 0.8 is 40 m/s². Got it.

Now, to find the magnitude of the total acceleration, I need to find the square root of the sum of the squares of a_c and a_t. So that's sqrt(80² + 40²). Let me calculate each square: 80 squared is 6400, 40 squared is 1600. Adding them gives 6400 + 1600 = 8000. Taking the square root of 8000... Hmm, what's sqrt(8000)?

Wait, 8000 is 100 * 80. So sqrt(100*80) = 10*sqrt(80). And sqrt(80) is sqrt(16*5) which is 4*sqrt(5). So 10*4*sqrt(5) is 40*sqrt(5). What's sqrt(5) approximately? It's about 2.236. So 40 * 2.236 is roughly 89.44 m/s².

Looking at the options, option C is 89.4, which matches this. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Check centripetal: 0.8 * (10)^2 = 0.8*100=80. Correct. Tangential: 0.8 *50=40. Correct. Sum squares: 80² is 6400, 40² is 1600. Sum 8000. Square root of 8000 is indeed about 89.44. So yes, option C is the right answer.

To solve the problem, we calculate the total acceleration of the discus by considering both the centripetal and tangential components of acceleration in circular motion.

1. **Convert the radius to meters**:  
   The radius of the circle is given as 80.0 cm, which is equivalent to \( r = 0.8 \, \text{m} \).

2. **Centripetal acceleration**:  
   The centripetal acceleration is given by the formula:  
   \[
   a_c = r \cdot \omega^2
   \]  
   Substituting the values \( r = 0.8 \, \text{m} \) and \( \omega = 10.0 \, \text{rad/s} \):  
   \[
   a_c = 0.8 \cdot (10)^2 = 0.8 \cdot 100 = 80.0 \, \text{m/s}^2
   \]

3. **Tangential acceleration**:  
   The tangential acceleration is given by the formula:  
   \[
   a_t = r \cdot \alpha
   \]  
   Substituting the values \( r = 0.8 \, \text{m} \) and \( \alpha = 50.0 \, \text{rad/s}^2 \):  
   \[
   a_t = 0.8 \cdot 50 = 40.0 \, \text{m/s}^2
   \]

4. **Total acceleration**:  
   The total acceleration is the magnitude of the vector sum of the centripetal and tangential accelerations. Using the Pythagorean theorem:  
   \[
   a_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{a_c^2 + a_t^2}
   \]  
   Substituting \( a_c = 80.0 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) and \( a_t = 40.0 \, \text{m/s}^2 \):  
   \[
   a_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{80^2 + 40^2} = \sqrt{6400 + 1600} = \sqrt{8000}
   \]  
   Simplifying further:  
   \[
   \sqrt{8000} = \sqrt{100 \cdot 80} = 10 \cdot \sqrt{80} = 10 \cdot (4 \cdot \sqrt{5}) = 40 \cdot \sqrt{5}
   \]  
   Approximating \( \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236 \):  
   \[
   a_{\text{total}} \approx 40 \cdot 2.236 = 89.44 \, \text{m/s}^2
   \]

5. **Matching the closest option**:  
   The closest value to \( 89.44 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) among the given options is **89.4**, which corresponds to option **C**.
