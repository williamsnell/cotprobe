Question:

A state law provides for an award of damages against anyone who publishes the name of a rape victim. Pursuant to that law, a woman sued a local newspaper in state court after the newspaper identified her as a rape victim. The state trial and appellate courts rejected the claim, holding that the state law was invalid under both the state constitution and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The state supreme court affirmed, holding specifically: "We think that this well-intentioned law very likely violates the First Amendment of the federal Constitution. We need not, however, decide that issue, because the law assuredly violates our state constitution, which provides even greater protection to the right of the press to report the news." The woman petitioned for review in the U.S. Supreme Court. Is the U.S. Supreme Court likely to review the state supreme court judgment?

Options:

A: No, because the woman already had the opportunity to present her case in the state courts.
B: No, because the First Amendment prohibits the imposition of liability for the publication of truthful information.
C: Yes, because the state supreme court made a constitutional error in its judgment.
D: No, because the U.S. Supreme Court generally does not review cases involving state laws.
E: No, because the judgment of the state supreme court rests upon an adequate and independent state-law ground.
F: Yes, because the U.S. Supreme Court has the power to review decisions of state supreme courts.
G: No, because the state supreme court's judgment was based on its interpretation of its own state's constitution.
H: Yes, because the First Amendment rights of the press are at stake.
I: Yes, because the supremacy clause does not permit a state to create rights greater than those conferred by the federal Constitution.
J: Yes, because the U.S. Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction extends to cases arising under federal law.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The scenario is about a state law that allows damages against anyone who publishes the name of a rape victim. A woman sued a newspaper under this law after they identified her as a rape victim. The state trial and appellate courts rejected her claim, saying the state law was invalid under both the state constitution and the First Amendment. The state supreme court affirmed, specifically stating that the law likely violates the First Amendment but definitely violates the state constitution, which offers greater press protections.

The woman then petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for review. The question is whether the Supreme Court is likely to review this judgment.

The options are A through J, each giving a different reason. I need to determine which is correct.

First, I remember that the U.S. Supreme Court has the authority to review state court decisions, particularly when there's a federal question involved. But there's a catch: if the state court's decision is based solely on independent and adequate state grounds, the Supreme Court won't review it. This is known as the adequate and independent state grounds doctrine.

In this case, the state supreme court said the law violates the state constitution, providing greater protections than the First Amendment. They mentioned that they didn't need to decide the First Amendment issue because the state constitution was sufficient. So the judgment rests on state law grounds.

Under the adequate and independent state grounds doctrine, if a state court's decision is supported by state law that's independent of federal law, the Supreme Court cannot review that decision. Because here, the state court's ruling was based on their own constitution, which they deemed sufficient, the Supreme Court would likely decline to review it.

Looking at the options:

E: No, because the judgment rests upon an adequate and independent state-law ground. That fits because the state supreme court's decision was based on state constitutional law, which is adequate and independent.

Other options: B says the First Amendment prohibits liability for truthful info. But the state court didn't decide on federal grounds; they used state law. So B's reasoning isn't why the Court wouldn't review.

F: Yes, because the Court can review state supreme courts. But that's true in general, except when there's an adequate state ground.

G: No, because based on state constitution. That's correct, but G says it's because of interpretation of their own constitution. But the key point is whether it's an adequate and independent ground. So E is more precise.

I: Supremacy clause doesn't allow states to create greater rights. That's not directly relevant here because the issue is the court's review, not whether the state's action is valid under supremacy.

So the correct answer should be E.

The U.S. Supreme Court is unlikely to review the state supreme court's judgment because the decision rests on an adequate and independent state-law ground. The state supreme court based its ruling on the state constitution, which provided sufficient reasoning without needing to address the First Amendment issue. Under the adequate and independent state grounds doctrine, the Supreme Court does not review such cases. 

E: No, because the judgment of the state supreme court rests upon an adequate and independent state-law ground.

Answer: E
