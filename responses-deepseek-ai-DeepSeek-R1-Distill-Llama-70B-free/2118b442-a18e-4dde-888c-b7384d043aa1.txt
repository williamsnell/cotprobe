Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says a company exchanged land for machinery. The land has an appraised value of $50,000 and an original cost of $20,000. The machinery has a fair value of $55,000. The transaction has commercial substance, so that's important. And the question is asking for the gain on the exchange. The options are A through J.

Hmm, I remember from my accounting classes that when there's an exchange of assets, the gain is recognized based on certain conditions. I think if the transaction has commercial substance, the gains and losses are recognized. Commercial substance means that the future cash flows are expected to change, so the transaction isn't just a like-kind exchange without any real change in the business.

Wait, so when assets are exchanged, you have to consider the fair values. The company is giving up land and getting machinery. The land's appraised value is higher than its original costâ€”so there's a potential gain there.

I think the formula for gain is the fair value of what's received minus the book value of what's given up. Oh wait, wait. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. When you exchange assets, the gain is the fair value of the asset received minus the book value of the asset given up. Or is it the difference between the fair value received and the original cost?

Wait, no. The asset given up is the land. Its book value is the original cost minus any accumulated depreciation, but the problem doesn't mention any depreciation, so I guess we can assume it's just the original cost of $20,000.

So the machinery received is $55,000 in fair value. The land's book value is $20,000. So the gain would be the difference between the fair value of the machinery and the book value of the land.

So that would be $55,000 - $20,000 = $35,000. Wait, but wait, the appraised value of the land is $50,000. Oh, but I think the appraised value is just the fair value of the land. But in the exchange, the company is giving up the land and getting machinery. So the key is that if the transaction has commercial substance, the company should recognize the gain immediately.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the gain as the difference between the fair value of the asset received and the book value of the asset given up. So machinery is received at $55k, land given up was on the books for $20k. So gain is 55k - 20k = 35k. But wait, I've heard that sometimes when both assets are of the same class, the gains might be deferred, but that's when the transaction lacks commercial substance.

But in this case, the problem states that the transaction has commercial substance, so gains are recognized. So the gain should be $35,000. Looking at the options, option H is $35,000.

Wait, but wait another thought. Let me make sure. Another possibility is that the gain is based on the difference between the appraised value and the original cost. So $50k (appraised) - $20k (original) = $30k gain. But I think that's not correct because the machinery's fair value is $55k, which is what the company is receiving. So the gain should be based on what's received compared to what's given up.

So the machinery is $55k, the land was on the books for $20k. So 55-20=35k. So option H is the correct answer.

To determine the gain on the exchange, we analyze the transaction where the company trades land (book value: $20,000) for machinery (fair value: $55,000). Since the transaction has commercial substance, the gain is recognized immediately.

The gain is calculated as the fair value of the asset received minus the book value of the asset given up. Here:

\[
\text{Gain} = \text{Fair value of machinery} - \text{Book value of land} = \$55,000 - \$20,000 = \$35,000
\]

Thus, the gain on the exchange is **$35,000**, corresponding to option **H**.

Answer: H
