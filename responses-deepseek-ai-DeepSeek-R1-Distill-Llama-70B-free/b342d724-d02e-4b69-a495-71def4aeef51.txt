Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the inverse z-transform of a function using partial fraction expansion. The function given is F(z) = (30z² -12z)/(6z² -5z +1). Hmm, I remember that the z-transform is a way to convert discrete-time signals, and the inverse transform would take us back from the z-domain to the time domain.

First, I think I should start by simplifying F(z). Maybe factor the denominator to make it easier to apply partial fractions. Let me see. The denominator is 6z² -5z +1. To factor this, I'll look for two numbers that multiply to 6*1=6 and add up to -5. Hmm, those numbers would be -2 and -3 because (-2)*(-3)=6 and (-2)+(-3)=-5. So I can split the middle term using these numbers.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check that. If I rewrite 6z² -5z +1 as 6z² -2z -3z +1, then factor by grouping. Grouping the first two and the last two terms: (6z² -2z) + (-3z +1). Factor out 2z from the first group and -1 from the second: 2z(3z -1) -1(3z -1). Oh, so (2z -1)(3z -1). So the denominator factors into (2z -1)(3z -1).

So F(z) becomes [30z² -12z] / [(2z-1)(3z-1)]. Now, I need to express this as partial fractions. The form would be (A z + B)/(2z -1) + (C z + D)/(3z -1). Wait, no, because the denominator is first order, so each term will be a constant divided by each factor. So maybe F(z) = A/(2z -1) + B/(3z -1). Wait, but wait, the numerator here is of degree 2 and the denominator is degree 2 as well. Oh wait, no. Let me check the degrees. Both numerator and denominator are degree 2. So to perform partial fractions, I might need to first check if the function is proper. Oh wait, because the degree of numerator and denominator are the same, I should start by performing polynomial division. Wait, no, because when the degrees are equal, the z-transform might involve a delta function or a constant term.

Alternatively, I think I should first divide numerator and denominator by z to get it into a proper fraction. Let me try that. Let me rewrite F(z) as F(z) = [30z² -12z]/[6z² -5z +1]. Let's divide numerator and denominator by z². So that gives [30 -12*(1/z)] / [6 -5*(1/z) + (1/z²)]. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach here. Alternatively, maybe I can write F(z) as a polynomial plus a proper fraction. Let's see:

The numerator is 30z² -12z, denominator is 6z² -5z +1. Let me factor the denominator as (6z² -5z +1) = 0, which we did earlier as (2z -1)(3z -1). So the denominator is (2z-1)(3z-1) = 6z² -5z +1.

Now, I can write F(z) as [30z² -12z]/(6z² -5z +1) = [ (30z² -12z) ] / [ (2z-1)(3z-1) ). Let's perform partial fraction decomposition. Since the denominator factors into two linear terms, each term in the partial fractions will be A/(2z-1) + B/(3z-1). 

Wait, but wait. Both numerator and denominator are degree 2, so when I write F(z) as A/(2z-1) + B/(3z-1), perhaps I should include constants, not linear terms, in the numerators. Let me try that.

So, let me set F(z) = A/(2z-1) + B/(3z-1). Then, combining these, I get:

[ A(3z-1) + B(2z-1) ] / [ (2z-1)(3z-1) ) ] = [ (3A + 2B) z - (A + B) ] / (6z² -5z +1).

This must equal the original numerator, which is 30z² -12z. Wait, wait a minute. Wait, the numerator in F(z) is 30z² -12z. But when I perform partial fractions, I get [ (3A + 2B) z - (A + B) ] as the numerator. But that's only a linear term in z, while the original numerator is quadratic. That suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Ah, right! Because when the degree of the numerator is equal to or higher than the denominator, we should first perform polynomial division. Oh wait, but in this case, the denominator and numerator are both degree 2, so F(z) can be expressed as a constant plus a proper fraction. Let me try that.

So, let me compute F(z) as (30z² - 12z)/(6z² -5z +1). Let me perform the division: divide 30z² -12z by 6z² -5z +1.

Divide 30z² by 6z² to get 5. Multiply 5 by (6z²-5z+1) to get 30z² -25z +5. Subtract this from the numerator: (30z^2 -12z) - (30z^2 -25z +5) = (0z^2) + (13z -5). So F(z) = 5 + (13z -5)/(6z² -5z +1).

Now, the remainder is (13z -5) and the denominator is 6z² -5z +1, which we factored earlier as (2z-1)(3z-1).

So now, we can write F(z) = 5 + (13z -5)/[(2z -1)(3z -1)]. Now, we can perform partial fractions on the second term.

So, let me express (13z -5)/[(2z-1)(3z-1)] as A/(2z-1) + B/(3z-1).

Multiplying both sides by (2z-1)(3z-1), we get 13z -5 = A(3z -1) + B(2z -1).

Now, expand the right side: 3A z - A + 2B z - B = (3A + 2B) z - (A + B).

So, equate coefficients on both sides:

For z: 3A + 2B =13.

For the constant term: -(A + B) = -5 → A + B =5.

Now, we have a system of equations:

1) 3A + 2B =13.

2) A + B =5.

Let me solve this system. From equation 2, B=5 - A.

Substitute into equation 1: 3A + 2*(5 -A) =13 → 3A +10 -2A =13 → A +10=13 → A=3.

Then, B=5 -3=2.

So, A=3 and B=2.

Thus, the partial fraction decomposition is:

(13z-5)/[(2z-1)(3z-1)] = 3/(2z-1) + 2/(3z-1).

Putting it all together, F(z) is equal to 5 + 3/(2z-1) + 2/(3z-1).

Wait a second, but wait. The inverse z-transform of constants can be tricky. Because the z-transform of a delta function is 1, and the inverse z-transform of a constant would involve delta functions. But wait, let me check: what is the inverse z-transform of 1? The z-transform of delta[n] is 1, so the inverse would be delta[n]. But wait, more accurately, the inverse z-transform of a constant K is K delta[n].

So, F(z) =5 + 3/(2z-1) + 2/(3z-1).

Now, to find the inverse z-transform, we can take the inverse of each term.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the partial fractions sign. Because when I have terms like 1/(2z-1), I need to consider if they can be expressed in terms of z^{-1}.

Wait, the standard form for the inverse z-transform for poles at z=a is 1/(1 - a z^{-1}), which corresponds to a^n u[n]. So let me adjust the terms accordingly.

Let me write each term as:

3/(2z -1) = (3/2) * 1/(z - 1/2) = (3/2) * z^{-1}/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1}).

Similarly, 2/(3z -1) = (2/3) * 1/(z - 1/3) = (2/3) * z^{-1}/(1 - (1/3) z^{-1}).

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to factor out z from the denominator. Let me try that.

Alternatively, 3/(2z -1) can be written as 3/(2z(1 - (1/(2z)) )) = (3/(2z)) * 1/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1} ). Hmm, but that may complicate things.

Wait, another approach: The term 3/(2z - 1) can be rewritten as (3/2) * [1/(z - 1/2)] = (3/2) * z^{-1} * [1/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1}) ].

Because 1/(z - a) = z^{-1}/(1 - a z^{-1} ), right? Because z - a = z (1 - a z^{-1} ), so 1/(z -a ) = z^{-1}/(1 - a z^{-1} ).

So, 3/(2z -1) = 3/(2(z - 1/2)) = (3/2) * [1/(z - 1/2)] = (3/2) * z^{-1}/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1} ).

Similarly, 2/(3z -1) = 2/(3(z - 1/3)) = (2/3) * 1/(z - 1/3) = (2/3) * z^{-1}/(1 - (1/3) z^{-1} ).

So, each of these terms, when taking the inverse z-transform, would correspond to (3/2) * (1/2)^{n-1} u[n-1] and (2/3) * (1/3)^{n-1} u[n-1], respectively.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exponents here. Let me think again. The inverse z-transform of z^{-k} X(z) is x[n -k], right? So, if we have X(z) = 1/(1 - a z^{-1}), then x[n] = a^n u[n]. So, if we have X(z) multiplied by z^{-1}, then the inverse transform is x[n-1] u[n-1].

So, for 3/(2z -1), which can be written as (3/2) * z^{-1}/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1} ), the inverse z-transform would be (3/2) * (1/2)^{n-1} u[n-1].

Similarly, the term 2/(3z -1) becomes (2/3) * (1/3)^{n-1} u[n-1].

Putting it all together, the inverse z-transform of F(z) is:

f[n] = 5 δ[n] + (3/2) (1/2)^{n-1} u[n-1] + (2/3) (1/3)^{n-1} u[n-1].

Hmm, but looking at the answer options, they don't have δ functions. So maybe I did something wrong earlier.

Wait, wait. Let me go back. So F(z) =5 + 3/(2z-1) + 2/(3z-1). So when I take the inverse z-transform, the 5 would become 5 δ[n]. But none of the options have a delta function. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I shouldn't have divided and instead kept F(z) as a proper fraction. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the polynomial division gives F(z) = 5 + (13z -5)/(denominator). Let me double-check that.

Wait, when I divided 30z² -12z by 6z² -5z +1, the quotient is 5, and the remainder is 13z -5. So yes, F(z) =5 + (13z-5)/(6z²-5z +1). So that part is correct.

So then, the partial fractions give (13z-5)/(denominator) =3/(2z-1) + 2/(3z-1).

So F(z) =5 + 3/(2z-1) + 2/(3z-1).

So when taking the inverse z-transform, each term would be:

- 5 → 5 δ[n]

- 3/(2z-1) → ?

Wait, perhaps there's another way to write 3/(2z-1). Let me factor out 2 from the denominator:

3/(2z -1) = (3/2) * 1/(z - 1/2) = (3/2) * (z^{-1})/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1} )

Because 1/(z - a) = z^{-1}/(1 - a z^{-1} )

So, 3/(2z-1) = (3/2) * z^{-1}/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1} )

Similarly, 2/(3z -1) = (2/3) * z^{-1}/(1 - (1/3) z^{-1} )

So the inverse z-transform of each of these terms would involve shifting.

For 3/(2z-1):

The inverse z-transform of (3/2) * z^{-1}/(1 - (1/2) z^{-1} ) is (3/2) * (1/2)^{n-1} u[n-1]

Similarly, 2/(3z-1) becomes (2/3) * (1/3)^{n-1} u[n-1].

So putting it all together, the inverse z-transform f[n] is:

f[n] =5 δ[n] + (3/2)(1/2)^{n-1} u[n-1] + (2/3)(1/3)^{n-1} u[n-1]

But let's simplify these terms:

(3/2)(1/2)^{n-1} = 3 (1/2)^{n} because (1/2)^{n-1} = 2*(1/2)^n → (3/2)*2*(1/2)^n =3 (1/2)^n.

Similarly, (2/3)(1/3)^{n-1} = 2*(1/3)^n because (1/3)^{n-1} =3*(1/3)^n → (2/3)*3*(1/3)^n=2*(1/3)^n.

So, f[n] =5 δ[n] +3 (1/2)^n u[n-1] +2 (1/3)^n u[n-1].

Wait, but u[n-1] is zero for n <0, and 1 for n≥0. But the δ[n] is non-zero only at n=0. So for n=0, the terms 3(1/2)^0 u[-1] and 2(1/3)^0 u[-1] are zero because u[-1] is zero. So at n=0, f[0] =5 δ[0] +0+0=5.

Now, looking at the answer options, none of them have a delta function, which suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps I shouldn't have done the polynomial division. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps F(z) can be expressed without the polynomial division because the degree of numerator and denominator are same, but maybe I can express it differently.

Wait, another approach: Let's go back to F(z) = [30z² -12z]/[6z² -5z +1]. Let me factor the numerator as well. Let's see, 30z² -12z =6z(5z - 2). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write F(z) as a sum of terms involving z^{-1}.

Wait, let's try to perform partial fractions without doing the polynomial division.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. Let me write F(z) as [30 z² -12 z]/[6 z² -5 z +1] = [ (30 z² -12 z) ] / [ (2z -1)(3z -1) ) ].

Let me express F(z) as A z + B over (2z-1)(3z-1). Wait, no, because the denominator is quadratic, so the partial fractions would be A/(2z-1) + B/(3z-1), as I did before. But earlier, that led to an issue with the numerator being quadratic. Hmm, perhaps that's the correct approach.

Wait, but when I did that, I ended up with F(z) =5 + 3/(2z-1) + 2/(3z-1), which includes a constant term. But the answer options don't include a delta function. So perhaps I made a mistake in the polynomial division step.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express F(z) without performing the polynomial division. Let me try that. So, F(z) = [30z² -12 z]/[ (2z-1)(3z-1)
