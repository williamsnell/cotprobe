Okay, so I've got this question about RC low-pass filters and noise power. Hmm, I remember that white noise has a flat power spectral density, right? So the input noise is probably given as some constant, maybe η. Wait, the options have η multiplied by other terms, so I think η is the power spectral density of the input noise.

The transfer function is given as H(f) = 1 / (1 + jf/f_c). Oh, right, f_c is the 3-dB cutoff frequency. So the output noise power is the integral of the squared magnitude of H(f) multiplied by the input noise power spectral density, integrated over all frequencies.

Wait, the squared magnitude of H(f)... Let's calculate that. H(f) is 1/(1 + jf/f_c), so |H(f)|² is 1 / (1 + (f/f_c)²). Right, because when you take the magnitude squared, the denominator becomes (1 + (f²/f_c²)).

So the output noise power N_0 is the integral from 0 to infinity of [1/(1 + (f/f_c)^2)] * η df. Oh wait, because the input is white noise with power spectral density η, that's a constant. So η is multiplied by the integral of |H(f)|² df from 0 to ∞.

Wait, but wait! No, actually, the output power spectral density is |H(f)|² multiplied by the input PSD. Since the input is white, the output PSD is η * |H(f)|². Then, the total output noise power is the integral of that from 0 to ∞.

So N_0 is η times ∫ (1 / (1 + (f²/f_c²))) df from 0 to ∞.

Let me compute that integral. Let me make a substitution. Let’s set x = f/(f_c). So f = x f_c, and df = f_c dx. Then the integral becomes ∫ [1/(1 + x²)] * f_c dx from x=0 to x=∞.

I remember that the integral of 1/(1+x²) dx from 0 to ∞ is π/2. So the integral becomes f_c * (π/2).

So putting it all together, N_0 = η * (f_c * π/2)/2? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me go through that again.

Wait, the integral substitution: ∫ [1/(1 + x²)] dx from 0 to ∞ is π/2. So when f goes from 0 to ∞, x does the same. So the integral I computed is f_c * (π/2). So N_0 is η multiplied by f_c * (π/2)/2? No, because the integral is f_c multiplied by π/2.

Wait no, let's recast it. The integral is f_c * ∫ [1/(1+x²)] dx from 0 to ∞. That integral is (π/2), so overall, the integral is (f_c * π)/2.

So N_0 is η multiplied by (f_c * π)/2. So N_0 = η f_c π / 2.

Looking at the options, option E is (η f_c π)/2. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait a second. Am I sure about the integral? Hmm, the integral of 1/(1+x²) from 0 to ∞ is indeed π/2. So that's correct. So yes, N_0 is (η f_c π)/2. So the correct answer is E.

The transfer function of the RC low-pass filter is given as \( H(f) = \frac{1}{1 + jf/f_c} \), where \( f_c \) is the 3-dB cutoff frequency. The input to the filter is white noise, which has a flat power spectral density (PSD) of \( \eta \). The output noise power \( N_0 \) is calculated by integrating the squared magnitude of the transfer function \( |H(f)|^2 \), multiplied by the input PSD \( \eta \), over all frequencies.

The squared magnitude of the transfer function is:

\[
|H(f)|^2 = \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{f}{f_c}\right)^2}.
\]

Thus, the output noise power is:

\[
N_0 = \eta \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{f}{f_c}\right)^2} \, df.
\]

To compute this integral, the substitution \( x = \frac{f}{f_c} \) is used, so \( f = x f_c \) and \( df = f_c dx \). The integral becomes:

\[
N_0 = \eta f_c \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \, dx.
\]

The integral \( \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \, dx \) is a standard result and equals \( \frac{\pi}{2} \). Substituting this result:

\[
N_0 = \eta f_c \cdot \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

Thus, the output noise power is:

\[
N_0 = \frac{\eta f_c \pi}{2}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**E: \( \frac{\eta f_c \pi}{2} \)**.
