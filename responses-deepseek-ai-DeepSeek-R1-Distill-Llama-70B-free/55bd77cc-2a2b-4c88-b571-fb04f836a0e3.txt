Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the Upper Paleolithic period and what indicates advances in human intellect during that time. I'm a bit rusty on my archaeology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which option most strongly indicates advances in human intellect. The options are from A to J. Let me go through each one and see what I remember.

Option A: Construction of permanent dwellings. I know that early humans did build shelters, but I'm not sure if that's specific to the Upper Paleolithic. Maybe earlier periods also had some forms of dwellings. So this might not be the strongest indicator.

Option B: Invention of the wheel. Wait, wasn't the wheel invented much later, like in the Neolithic period or even later? So probably not the Upper Paleolithic, which is around 50,000 to 10,000 years ago. So B is likely not correct.

Option C: Parietal and mobiliary art. Parietal art refers to cave paintings, like Lascaux, right? And mobiliary art would be portable art, such as carvings on stones or bones. Upper Paleolithic is known for this kind of art, which suggests advanced symbolic thinking. That seems like a strong candidate.

Option D: Creation of writing systems. Writing came much later, I think. Like, Mesopotamia around 3,500 BCE or so. So D is probably out.

Option E: Development of pottery. Pottery is more associated with the Neolithic, maybe around 9,000 years ago. Upper Paleolithic is before that, so E might not be it.

Option F: Domestication of plants and animals. I associate this with the Neolithic Revolution as well, around 10,000 years ago. The Upper Paleolithic was still a time of hunter-gatherers, so F might not fit.

Option G: New stone-tool technologies. The Upper Paleolithic did have more advanced tools, like the use of blades and more sophisticated flint tools. But I'm not sure if this is the strongest indicator of intellect compared to other options, like art which shows abstract thinking.

Option H: Acquisition of non-local raw materials. This suggests trade networks. That's a form of social complexity, which could indicate advanced planning and organization, but is that more about intellect or economics?

Option I: Increased use of fire. I'm pretty sure control of fire goes way back, maybe even before Homo sapiens. So Upper Paleolithic probably had advanced use, but it's not a new development specific to that period as an indication of intellect.

Option J: Changes in settlement patterns. Maybe moving to better locations or more organized living arrangements. Again, not sure if this directly points to intellectual advances compared to things like art or technology.

So, narrowing this down. The Upper Paleolithic is often cited for the emergence of art and symbolic behavior, which are big indicators of cognitive advancement. So option C, parietal and mobiliary art, would be a strong indicator. Also, option G is about tool tech, which is also a good point, but I think art might be more directly tied to intellect because it's about abstract thinking and expression.

Therefore, the answer is probably C.

The Upper Paleolithic period, spanning approximately 50,000 to 10,000 years ago, is notable for significant advancements in human intellect. Among the options provided, **parietal and mobiliary art** stands out as the strongest indicator of intellectual progress. Parietal art, such as cave paintings, and mobiliary art, like portable carvings, demonstrate advanced symbolic thinking and creative expression, which are hallmark cognitive advancements of this era. While other options, such as new stone-tool technologies, also reflect progress, they are more tied to practical innovation rather than the abstract and symbolic thinking evident in art. Thus, the correct answer is:

C
