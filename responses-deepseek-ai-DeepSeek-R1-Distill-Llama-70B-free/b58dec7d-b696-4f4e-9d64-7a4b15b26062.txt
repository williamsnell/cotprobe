Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the hydrolysis of Al^3+ ions. The given information is that the hydrolysis constant (I think that's K_h) is 1.4 × 10^-5, and the solution is 0.1 M AlCl3. They're asking for the concentration of H3O+ ions.

Alright, I remember that when a salt like AlCl3 dissolves in water, the Al^3+ ions can undergo hydrolysis. Hydrolysis for metal ions usually means they react with water to produce H3O+ ions, making the solution acidic. So Al^3+ is acting as an acid here.

The formula I recall for the hydrolysis of a metal ion is something like M^(n+) + water ↔ M(OH)^(n-1) + H3O+. And the hydrolysis constant K_h is given by [M(OH)^(n-1)][H3O+] / [M^(n+)].

Wait, but wait. Wait, maybe it's more accurate to write the reaction as Al^3+ + H2O ↔ Al(OH)^2+ + H+. Oh wait, that's another way. Hmm. Or perhaps I should think in terms of the general formula for a trivalent metal ion.

Wait, AlCl3 dissociates into Al^3+ and Cl^- ions. So the concentration of Al^3+ is 0.1 M because AlCl3 is a strong electrolyte and fully dissociates. So [Al^3+] = 0.1 M.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction would be Al^3+ + H2O ↔ Al(OH)^2+ + H3O+. So the H+ comes from the hydrolysis, right?

The hydrolysis constant K_h is given as 1.4e-5. So the expression would be K_h = [Al(OH)^2+][H3O+] / [Al^3+].

Since initially, before hydrolysis, the concentration of Al^3+ is 0.1 M, and the products are zero. Let's let x be the concentration of H3O+ produced. So at equilibrium, [Al^3+] = 0.1 - x, [Al(OH)^2+] = x, and [H3O+] = x.

Wait, but wait, in the hydrolysis reaction, each Al^3+ produces one H3O+. So the assumption is that x is small compared to 0.1, so maybe 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1. That simplifies the calculation.

So substituting into the K_h expression:

K_h = (x)(x) / (0.1) = x² / 0.1 = 1.4e-5.

So solving for x²: x² = 1.4e-5 * 0.1 = 1.4e-6.

Taking square root, x = sqrt(1.4e-6). Let me calculate that. The square root of 1e-6 is 1e-3. The square root of 1.4 is approximately 1.18, so 1.18e-3. So x ≈ 1.18e-3 M.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option G is 1.2e-3, which is close. Option J is 1e-3. Hmm, but perhaps I should be more precise with the calculation.

Let me compute sqrt(1.4e-6). Let's think: 1.4e-6 is 1.4 * 1e-6. The square root is sqrt(1.4) * sqrt(1e-6) = approx 1.1832 * 0.001 = 0.0011832, which is about 1.18e-3. So that's approximately 1.2e-3 M, which would match option G.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. The hydrolysis reaction I wrote produces H3O+ and Al(OH)^2+. Is that correct? Because in some cases, the hydrolysis can produce H+ ions, but perhaps in this case, the H3O+ comes directly.

Alternatively, another approach is to realize that for each Al^3+ that hydrolyzes, it produces one H3O+. So the [H3O+] is equal to the concentration of Al(OH)^2+.

Wait, but another point: when you have Al^3+ hydrolyzing, the initial assumption is that x is small, so 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1. Is that valid? Let's check. If x is around 1e-3, then 0.1 - 0.001 = 0.099, which is about 0.1, so the assumption holds. So our calculation should be correct.

So the [H3O+] is approx 1.2e-3 M. Looking at the options, option G is 1.2 × 10^-3 M. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait a minute, but another thought: the hydrolysis constant is given, and I used it correctly. Let me make sure about the formula. K_h is [Al(OH)^2+][H3O+] divided by [Al^3+]. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, sometimes the hydrolysis can be represented as producing H+ instead of H3O+, but in that case, the concentration of H+ would be the same as H3O+ because H3O+ is the source of H+.

So I think my approach is correct, and the answer is option G.

To determine the concentration of \( [\text{H}_3\text{O}^+] \) in a 0.1 M \( \text{AlCl}_3 \) solution, we start by recognizing that \( \text{AlCl}_3 \) fully dissociates into \( \text{Al}^{3+} \) and \( \text{Cl}^- \), giving an initial \( [\text{Al}^{3+}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The hydrolysis of \( \text{Al}^{3+} \) occurs via the reaction:

\[
\text{Al}^{3+} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{Al}(\text{OH})^{2+} + \text{H}_3\text{O}^+
\]

The hydrolysis constant \( K_h \) is given as \( 1.4 \times 10^{-5} \), and its expression is:

\[
K_h = \frac{[\text{Al}(\text{OH})^{2+}][\text{H}_3\text{O}^+]}{[\text{Al}^{3+}]}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{H}_3\text{O}^+ \) produced at equilibrium. Since \( \text{Al}^{3+} \) hydrolyzes to produce one \( \text{H}_3\text{O}^+ \) ion per reaction, \( [\text{Al}(\text{OH})^{2+}] = x \) and \( [\text{H}_3\text{O}^+] = x \). The equilibrium concentration of \( \text{Al}^{3+} \) is approximately \( 0.1 - x \), but since \( x \) is expected to be small compared to 0.1, we approximate \( [\text{Al}^{3+}] \approx 0.1 \).

Substituting into the \( K_h \) expression:

\[
K_h = \frac{x^2}{0.1}
\]

\[
x^2 = K_h \cdot 0.1 = (1.4 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 0.1 = 1.4 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{1.4 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 1.18 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

This value is approximately \( 1.2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \), which matches option G. The assumption that \( x \) is small is valid because \( x \ll 0.1 \).

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{H}_3\text{O}^+ \) is approximately \( 1.2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \).
