Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about ring theory, specifically regarding subrings and fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question has two statements. Statement 1 says, "The unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring." Statement 2 claims, "Every field is an integral domain." I need to evaluate each statement as true or false and choose the correct option from A to J.

Let's tackle Statement 1 first. A subring is a subset of a ring that is itself a ring under the same operations. Now, rings can have unity (a multiplicative identity) or not. But when they talk about the subring having the same unity as the ring, I wonder about the conditions.

Wait, I remember that for a subring, if the larger ring has a unity, the subring must contain that same unity element. Because one of the subring criteria is that it must be closed under multiplication and contain the multiplicative identity if the ring has one. So if the main ring R has 1 as unity, any subring S of R must also have 1 as its unity. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a subring. So Statement 1 should be true.

Wait, but wait! What if the main ring doesn't have a unity? Oh, but the statement is about the subring's unity. If the main ring has a unity, then the subring must have the same. But if the main ring doesn't have a unity, then the subring also doesn't, but the statement doesn't specify that. So the statement is making a claim when the ring has unity. So Statement 1 is true.

Now, Statement 2: Every field is an integral domain. I remember that a field is a commutative ring where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity where there are no zero divisors (i.e., if ab=0 then a=0 or b=0).

So, since a field is a commutative ring with unity (because every field has 1, except maybe the zero ring, but fields by definition exclude the zero ring), and in a field, the only way ab=0 is if a or b is zero, because every non-zero element is invertible. So yes, a field is an integral domain. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but wait again. Are all fields integral domains? Yes, because in a field, the only ideals are the zero ideal and the field itself, making it a simple ring. Also, the absence of zero divisors is a key point. So yes, Statement 2 is true.

So both statements are true. So the correct choice would be option A: True, True.

But wait, looking back at the options, option A is True, True. But let me double-check if Statement 1 is always true. Suppose the ring R has a unity 1. Then any subring S of R must contain 1. Oh, wait, no. Actually, I'm a bit confused now. Because sometimes, subrings might not necessarily include 1 unless specified.

Wait, no. The definition of a subring requires it to be a subset that is a ring under the same operations. If the parent ring R has a unity, then for S to be a subring, it must satisfy all ring axioms, including containing 1 if R has 1. So yes, the subring must contain 1, making the unity the same. So Statement 1 is true.

So yeah, both statements are true. So the answer is A.

Statement 1: "The unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring."  
- A subring is a subset of a ring that satisfies all ring axioms under the same operations. If the parent ring has a unity, the subring must contain that same unity to satisfy the ring axioms. Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

Statement 2: "Every field is an integral domain."  
- A field is a commutative ring with unity where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity and no zero divisors. Since a field has no zero divisors (as every non-zero element is invertible), it satisfies the definition of an integral domain. Thus, Statement 2 is **True**.

Both statements are true, so the correct answer is **A: True, True**.

Answer: A
