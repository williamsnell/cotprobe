Okay, so I've got this fluid mechanics problem here about boundary layer thickness. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to walk through it step by step.

The problem says it's a steady, turbulent, constant property, two-dimensional boundary layer flow over a flat plate at zero angle. The velocity profile is given by u equals v times (y over delta) raised to the 1/7 power. Oh right, v is the free stream velocity, delta is the boundary layer thickness.

Then there's the local skin friction coefficient formula: C_f equals 0.045 times (kinematic viscosity over rho times v) raised to the 1/4 power. Wait, so C_f is given in terms of the Reynolds number, right? Because Re is rho v L over kinematic viscosity, which is nu. So I think the term (nu/(rho v)) is 1/Re, but raised to some power.

The goal is to determine delta as a function of x using the integral form of the momentum equation. I remember that the integral momentum equation for a boundary layer is derived from the momentum balance. The equation is something like the derivative of the momentum thickness with respect to x equals the skin friction coefficient divided by 2, maybe? Or wait, more precisely, the rate of change of momentum thickness theta dx is equal to the wall shear stress tau over density and velocity, perhaps.

Wait, the integral momentum equation for boundary layers is: d(theta)/dx = (C_f)/(2), right? Or is it something else. Let me think. Momentum thickness theta is the integral of (u/U) (1 - u/U) dy from 0 to delta. No, wait, theta is the integral from 0 to delta of (u/U) dy, times (1 - (u/U)), no—actually, wait, the momentum thickness is the integral of (u/u_infinity) * (1 - u/u_infinity) dy? No, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me get this straight.

Momentum thickness theta is defined as the integral from 0 to delta of (u(y)/U) * (1 - u(y)/U) dy. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. No, wait, no, the momentum thickness is the integral of (u(y)/U) * (1 - (u(y)/U)) dy, which is the same as the integral of (u/U)(1 - u/U) dy from 0 to delta. Or wait, maybe it's the integral of (u/U) dy minus the integral of (u/U)^2 dy. Hmm, perhaps I should look up the exact formula, but since I can't, I need to think.

Alternatively, I remember that the momentum equation in integral form is: (d/dx)(theta) = (tau_0)/(rho U^2), where theta is the momentum thickness, tau_0 is the wall shear stress, rho is density, and U is free stream velocity. Yeah, that rings a bell. So, d(theta)/dx = tau_0/(rho U^2).

But wait, I also know that the skin friction coefficient C_f is defined as tau_0/(0.5 rho U^2). So, tau_0 is C_f * 0.5 rho U^2. Substituting that into the equation, we get d(theta)/dx = (C_f * 0.5 rho U^2) / (rho U^2) ) = C_f / 2.

So, d(theta)/dx = C_f / 2.

Now, I need to express theta in terms of delta and the given velocity profile. The velocity profile is u = U (y/delta)^(1/7). So u/U = (y/delta)^(1/7).

Theta is the integral from 0 to delta of (u/U)(1 - u/U) dy. Let me compute that.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the exact definition of theta is the integral from 0 to delta of (u/U) dy times (1 - (u/U)), or is it something else? Hmm, no, I think the standard momentum thickness theta is the integral of (u/U)(1 - (u/U)) dy. No, wait, no. No, I'm getting confused between displacement thickness and momentum thickness.

Displacement thickness delta_1 is the integral from 0 to delta of (1 - u/U) dy. Momentum thickness theta is the integral from 0 to delta of (u/U)(1 - u/U) dy. Right, that's correct.

Wait, no! Wait, no. Let me double-check. The displacement thickness is delta_1 = integral (1 - u/U) dy. The momentum thickness is theta = integral u/U (1 - u/U) dy. So yes, that's correct.

So let me compute theta first.

Given u = U (y/delta)^(1/7), so u/U = (y/delta)^(1/7). Let me call this u/U = (y/delta)^n where n=1/7.

So theta = integral from 0 to delta [ (y/delta)^n * (1 - (y/delta)^n) ] dy.

Let me make a substitution, let z = y/delta. Then y = z delta, dy = delta dz. So the integral becomes:

theta = integral from z=0 to z=1 of [ z^n (1 - z^n ) ] * delta dz.

So theta = delta * integral (z^n - z^(2n)) dz from 0 to1.

The integral of z^n is [z^(n+1)]/(n+1) evaluated from 0 to1. Similarly for z^(2n).

So,

theta = delta * [ (1/(n+1)) - (1/(2n +1)) ) ]

Hmm. Let me compute for n=1/7.

n=1/7, so n+1 = 8/7, 2n+1= 2*(1/7) +1= 9/7.

So,

theta = delta * [ (7/8) - (7/9) ) ]

Compute 7/8 -7/9 = 7*(9 -8)/(72) )= 7*(1)/(72) )=7/72.

So theta = delta * (7/72) = (7 delta ) /72.

So that's theta in terms of delta.

Now, the next part is to relate d(theta)/dx with C_f.

We have d(theta)/dx = C_f / 2.

So, let's compute d(theta)/dx.

theta = (7 delta)/(72).

So d(theta)/dx = (7/72) d(delta)/dx.

So,

(7/72) d(delta)/dx = C_f / 2.

But wait, C_f is given as a function of (nu/(rho U)) and x, perhaps. Let me look back at the given C_f equation.

C_f = 0.045 (nu/(rho U))^{1/4}.

Wait, no, the given is C_f = 0.045 (nu/(rho V))^{1/4}, but V is the free stream velocity, which is U here. So, C_f = 0.045 (nu/(rho U))^{1/4}.

But (nu/(rho U)) is 1/Re_y, where Re_y is Reynolds number based on y, but in this case, perhaps the Reynolds number is based on x.

Wait, wait. The Reynolds number is usually Re_x = (rho U x)/mu = (U x)/(nu), since nu = mu/rho.

So, nu/(rho U) is (1/(Re_x)).

So, (nu/(rho U))^{1/4} = Re_x^{-1/4}.

So, C_f = 0.045 Re_x^{-1/4}.

So now, let's plug into the differential equation.

We have:

(7/72) d(delta)/dx = (0.045) Re_x^{-1/4} /2.

Wait, wait no, let's correct. Because C_f is 0.045 (nu/(rho U))^{1/4}.

But for the local Reynolds number, it's Re_x = (U x)/nu. So, (nu/(U x)) = 1/Re_x.

Wait, but in the C_f expression, it's (nu/(rho U)), which is (nu/(U))/rho, but since nu=mu/rho, nu/(U) is (mu/(rho U)).

Wait, perhaps I should express (nu/(rho U)) as (nu/(U)) / rho. But that's getting messy. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that (nu/(rho U)) = (1/Re), where Re is Re_x = (U x)/nu. Wait, no, because (rho U x)/mu is Re_x, and nu = mu/rho, so Re_x = (U x)/(nu). So, (nu/(U)) = (1/Re_x) * x. Wait, perhaps that's more complicated than it needs to be. Alternatively, perhaps (nu/(rho U)) = (nu)/(U) * (1/rho). But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, in any case, the C_f expression is given as 0.045 (nu/(rho V))^{1/4}. Since V is the free stream velocity, which is U, then C_f = 0.045 (nu/(rho U))^{1/4}.

But (nu/(rho U)) is (nu/(U)) / rho. But since nu = mu/rho, then nu/(U) = (mu/(rho U)). So, (nu/(rho U)) = (mu)/(rho^2 U). Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write (nu/(rho U)) = (1/(Re_x)) * (x), but I'm not sure. Let me think. Re_x is (U x)/nu, so nu/(U x) = 1/(Re_x). So, (nu/(U)) = (x)/(Re_x).

Wait, nu/(U x) = 1/Re_x → nu/(U) = x/(Re_x * x) ? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me correct.

Wait, Re_x = (U x)/nu → nu = (U x)/Re_x.

So, (nu/(U)) = x/(Re_x).

So, (nu/(rho U)) = (x)/(Re_x * rho) → no, wait, because rho is in the denominator, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of Re_x.

Let me see, C_f = 0.045 (nu/(rho U))^{1/4}.

But (nu/(rho U)) = (nu/(U))/rho = (x/Re_x) / rho? Wait, no, because Re_x is (U x)/(nu) → nu = (U x)/Re_x.

So, (nu/(U)) = x/(Re_x).

Wait, so (nu/(U)) = x/(Re_x). So, (nu/(rho U)) = (x)/(Re_x * rho) → but rho is density, which is in the denominator. Hmm, perhaps I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express (nu/(rho U)) as (1/(Re_x)) * (U x)/(U) )? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps (nu/(rho U)) = (nu/(U)) * (1/rho) → but since nu = mu/rho, this equals (mu/(rho U)) * (1/rho) )= mu/(rho^2 U). Which doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of Re_x = (U x)/nu → nu = (U x)/Re_x.

So,

(nu/(rho U)) = ( (U x)/Re_x )/(rho U) ) = (x) / (Re_x * rho) ) → but perhaps I'm overcomplicating things.

Wait, maybe I can just proceed with the equation as is. Let's go back.

We have:

(7/72) d(delta)/dx = C_f / 2.

C_f = 0.045 (nu/(rho U))^{1/4}.

So, substituting C_f:

(7/72) d(delta)/dx = (0.045 / 2) (nu/(rho U))^{1/4}.

Simplify 0.045/2 → that's 0.0225.

So,

d(delta)/dx = (0.0225 * 72 /7 ) * (nu/(rho U))^{1/4}.

Compute 0.0225 *72 → 0.0225 *70 = 1.575, 0.0225*2=0.045 → total 1.62.

Wait, 72/7 is approximately 10.2857, but let me compute 0.0225 *72 = (0.02 *72) + (0.0025 *72) → 1.44 + 0.18 = 1.62.

So, 1.62 /7 → approximately 0.2314.

Wait, but let me compute it accurately:

72/7 is approximately 10.2857.

So 0.0225 * 72 = 1.62.

1.62 /7 = 0.231428... So approximately 0.2314.

So,

d(delta)/dx = 0.2314 * (nu/(rho U))^{1/4}.

But wait, (nu/(rho U)) is (1/(Re_x)) * (U x)/ (U) ) ? No, because Re_x is (U x)/nu → so, (nu/(U)) = x/(Re_x).

Wait, so (nu/(rho U)) = (x)/(Re_x * rho) → but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should express in terms of Re_x.

Wait, Re_x is (U x)/nu → so (nu/(U x)) = 1/Re_x → (nu/(U)) = x/(Re_x).

So, (nu/(rho U)) = (x) / (Re_x * rho).

But rho is a constant, so perhaps this approach isn't helping. Maybe it's better to take (nu/(rho U))^{1/4} = (1/(Re_x))^{1/4} multiplied by something.

Wait, perhaps (nu/(rho U)) = (1/(Re_x)) * (x U) / (rho U x) )? No, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let's think again: C_f is given as 0.045 (nu/(rho U))^{1/4}.

But the term (nu/(rho U)) can be expressed as (nu/(U)) * (1/rho). Since nu = mu/rho, then nu/(U) is (mu)/(rho U). So, (nu/(rho U)) = (mu)/(rho^2 U). Hmm, but I'm not sure how this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better approach. Let me think about the Reynolds number. Re_x = (U x)/nu.

So, (nu/(rho U)) = (nu/(U)) * (1/rho) = (nu/(rho U)).

Wait, perhaps I can write (nu/(rho U)) = (1/(Re_x)) * (x U)/(U x) * rho? No, that's not right.

Wait, Re_x = (U x)/nu → solving for nu: nu = (U x)/Re_x.

So, (nu/(rho U)) = ( (U x)/Re_x ) / (rho U) ) = x/(Re_x * rho) → but x is the variable here, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should express (nu/(rho U)) in terms of Re_x, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I can let (nu/(rho U)) = (1/(Re_x)) * (x/ L), where L is some characteristic length, but in this problem, the only length scale is x itself, so perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed by substituting (nu/(rho U))^{1/4} into the equation and see if I can express it in terms of Re_x.

Wait, let me think in terms of the equation I have:

d(delta)/dx = 0.2314 * (nu/(rho U))^{1/4}.

But (nu/(rho U)) is (1/(Re_x)) * (x U)/(U x) ) → no, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps (nu/(rho U)) = (1/Re_x) * (x/(U)) )? Wait, no, because Re_x is (U x)/nu.

Wait, wait, Re_x = (U x)/nu → so (nu/(U)) = x/Re_x.

So, (nu/(rho U)) = (x)/(Re_x * rho).

But then, (nu/(rho U))^{1/4} = (x/(Re_x * rho))^{1/4}.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of (nu/(rho U)) = (1/(Re_x)) * something.

Wait, Re_x = (U x)/nu → nu = (U x)/Re_x.

So, (nu/(rho U)) = ( (U x)/Re_x )/(rho U) ) = x/(Re_x * rho).

But I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe I should instead express (nu/(rho U))^{1/4} in terms of Re_x.

Wait, let me consider that (nu/(rho U)) = (nu/(U)) * (1/rho) = (x/Re_x) * (1/rho).

But I'm not sure. Let's perhaps make an assumption that rho is a constant, so (nu/(rho U))^{1/4} can be expressed as (1/(Re_x^{1/4})) multiplied by some function of x. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed by considering that (nu/(rho U)) is a term that can be expressed in terms of Re_x.

Wait, let me try this substitution: (nu/(rho U)) = (1/(Re_x)) * (x U)/ (x U) ) → no, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should express (nu/(rho U)) as (1/Re_x) * something.

Wait, Re_x is (U x)/nu → so (nu/(U x)) = 1/Re_x → (nu/(U)) = x/(Re_x).

So, (nu/(rho U)) = (x/(Re_x)) * (1/rho).

But this seems to complicate things because I'm introducing x into the term,
