Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about calculating the value of inventory using the LIFO method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on LIFO, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the company has 30 widgets in inventory. They've made a few purchases, and I need to figure out the cost based on the last-in, first-out method. Wait, right, LIFO means the most recent items are sold first, so their costs are the first to be expensed. But for inventory valuation, we value the remaining stock based on the oldest costs.

Looking at the data provided:

- On Dec 2, they had 6 units at $2.30. Wait, is that the beginning inventory? Or is it a purchase? The wording says "Inventory, Dec 2: 6 units." So maybe that's the starting point before any purchases, meaning that's the initial stock.

Then there are three purchases:
1. Jan 15: 352 units at $2.50 each.
2. Feb 4: 101 units at $2.20 each.
3. Feb 14: 645 units at $2.00 each.

Wait, but the total units purchased would be 352 + 101 + 645. Let me calculate that: 352 + 101 is 453, plus 645 is 1098. Oh wait, but the company only has 30 widgets on hand. So the sales must have happened in between, but the problem doesn't give sales data. Oh, wait, no, the problem says "the company discovers that it has 30 widgets on hand." So perhaps the initial inventory was 6 units, and then they made purchases, and then sold some, leaving 30. But we don't have sales data, so this must be a periodic inventory system where the ending inventory is 30, and the total units to account for are 6 + 352 + 101 + 645 minus ending inventory of 30. Wait, but let me think.

Wait, maybe the initial inventory is 6 units, and then they add the purchases. So total units available for sale would be initial + all purchases. Let me add them up: 6 + 352 = 358, plus 101 is 459, plus 645 makes 1104 units in total. But the ending inventory is 30, so the number of units sold would be 1104 - 30 = 1074. But how does that help me?

Under LIFO, the cost of the ending inventory is based on the earliest prices. So for the 30 units, we take the oldest units first. So the order of costing would be:

The initial inventory is the oldest, then Jan 15 purchase, then Feb 4, then Feb 14. Wait no, because in LIFO, the most recent purchases are sold first. So the remaining inventory would be the oldest units.

So the 30 units in inventory would come from the earliest possible layers.

Let me break it down:

The company starts with 6 units at $2.30 each. Then they purchase 352 in Jan, 101 in Feb, and 645 in Feb 14.

So, when calculating the ending inventory, we take the earliest units first. So the 6 units are part of the ending inventory because they were never sold (since they're the oldest). Then, the next layer would be the earliest purchase after that. Wait, no, because LIFO assumes that the most recent purchases are sold first. So the ending inventory consists of the earliest units available after all the sales.

So to calculate the cost, we need to see how many units are left from each purchase, starting from the oldest.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to take the total units available (6 + 352 + 101 + 645 = 1104), subtract the ending inventory (30), so 1074 units were sold. Under LIFO, these sold units would be the most recent purchases first.

So the order of selling would be: first from the Feb 14 purchase (645 units), then Feb 4 (101), then Jan 15 (352), and finally the initial 6.

But wait, the total sold is 1074. Let's see how much comes from each layer.

Start with the latest purchase: Feb 14 has 645 units. All 645 are sold, leaving 1074 - 645 = 429 units left to account for.

Next layer up is the Feb 4 purchase of 101 units. So those 101 are sold, now 429 - 101 = 328 left.

Next is the Jan 15 purchase of 352 units. So 328 are taken from here, leaving 352 - 328 = 24 units remaining in this layer.

So the sold units are all of Feb14 (645), all of Feb4 (101), and 328 of Jan15. The remaining inventory comes from Jan15's remaining 24 units and the initial 6 units.

Wait, no. Because the initial 6 units are the oldest and would only be used if all other layers are sold. But in this case, after selling 645 + 101 + 328 = 1074, the remaining inventory is 30 units. So those 30 must come from the oldest available, which would be the initial 6 and the remaining 24 from Jan15's purchase.

Wait, because after selling 328 from Jan15's 352, there's 24 left (352 - 328 =24). So the total remaining is 6 (initial) +24 (Jan15) =30, which matches the ending inventory.

So the cost of the ending inventory would be:

6 units * $2.30 (from initial inventory) plus 24 units * $2.50 (from Jan15 purchase).

Wait, wait, no. Because the Jan15 purchase is at $2.50 per unit. So 24 * 2.50 = 60. 6 * 2.30 =13.8. Total is 73.8.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is $73.80, which would fit. So the answer would be I.

Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the initial inventory is 6 units at $2.30. Then, the next available layer after that is Jan15's 352 units. But since after selling, the remaining from Jan15 is 24 units. So the 30 units in inventory are 6 (initial) +24 (Jan15). So 6*2.30 =13.8, 24*2.50=60. Sum is 73.8, which is option I.

Wait, but I thought that in LIFO, the latest purchase is sold first. So the ending inventory would consist of the oldest units. So yes, the 6 initial and then the 24 from Jan15.

Yes, that makes sense. So the total is 73.8, which is option I.

To determine the value of the widgets in inventory under the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) method, we start by noting that the company has 30 widgets on hand. The total units available for sale are calculated as follows:

- **Initial inventory**: 6 units at $2.30 each.
- **Purchases**:
  - January 15: 352 units at $2.50 each.
  - February 4: 101 units at $2.20 each.
  - February 14: 645 units at $2.00 each.

The total units available for sale are:

\[
6 + 352 + 101 + 645 = 1,104 \, \text{units}.
\]

Since the company has 30 units remaining in inventory, the number of units sold is:

\[
1,104 - 30 = 1,074 \, \text{units}.
\]

Under the LIFO method, the most recent purchases are assumed to be sold first. Therefore, the units sold are allocated as follows:

1. **February 14 purchase**: All 645 units are sold.
2. **February 4 purchase**: All 101 units are sold.
3. **January 15 purchase**: The remaining units sold are:

\[
1,074 - (645 + 101) = 328 \, \text{units}.
\]

After these sales, the remaining inventory consists of:

1. The initial 6 units at $2.30 each.
2. The remaining units from the January 15 purchase:

\[
352 - 328 = 24 \, \text{units at $2.50 each}.
\]

The total value of the remaining inventory is calculated as:

\[
(6 \times 2.30) + (24 \times 2.50) = 13.80 + 60.00 = 73.80.
\]

Thus, the value of the widgets in inventory under the LIFO method is **$73.80**.
