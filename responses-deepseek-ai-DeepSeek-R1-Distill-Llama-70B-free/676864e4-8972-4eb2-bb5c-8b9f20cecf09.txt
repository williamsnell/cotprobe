Okay, let's try to figure out this physics problem step by step. So the question is about a clown juggling four balls, and we need to find the minimum vertical speed each ball must be thrown upwards. Hmm, okay.

Alright, so the clown takes 0.9 seconds to cycle each ball through his hands. That includes catching, transferring, and throwing. So I think that means each ball spends 0.9 seconds in the air before it's caught again. Or wait, maybe the total cycle time is 0.9 seconds, so each ball is in the air for a portion of that time. Since there are four balls, maybe each one is thrown and caught in a cycle that's 0.9 seconds divided by 4? Because if you have four balls, each would be thrown in succession, so the time each spends in the air would be a quarter of the total cycle time. So 0.9 seconds divided by 4 is 0.225 seconds. That's the time each ball is in the air before being caught again.

Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Because if the cycle time is 0.9 seconds, that's the time between when a ball is thrown and when it's caught again. But since there are four balls, each one is being juggled in a way that they're in the air for a certain time. I think in juggling, the time a ball spends in the air is the same as the time between throws. So if the cycle is 0.9 seconds, that's the time each ball takes to go up and come back down to be caught. So the time of flight for each ball is 0.9 seconds.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if you have four balls, the time between each throw is shorter than the total cycle. Let me think. Imagine each throw happens every T seconds, and each ball is in the air for a certain time. So the total cycle time would be the time it takes for a ball to go up, come down, and be caught, so the time of flight is the same as the cycle time. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the cycle time is the time between when one ball is caught and when it's thrown again. In that case, the time each ball is in the air is equal to the cycle time. But that seems too long because with four balls, you'd have overlapping throws. Hmm, perhaps I should look up the juggling equations, but since I can't, I'll have to think.

In juggling, the time a ball is in the air is determined by how many beats or throws are happening. The formula I remember is that the time each ball spends in the air (t) is equal to the total cycle time (T) divided by the number of objects being juggled (n). So t = T/n. So in this case, T is 0.9 seconds, n is 4. So t = 0.9 /4 = 0.225 seconds. That's the time the ball is in the air.

So now, the problem becomes finding the minimum vertical speed required to throw the ball so that it stays in the air for 0.225 seconds. But wait, the minimum speed would be when the ball just reaches the peak of its trajectory and comes back down in that time.

In projectile motion, the time a projectile spends going up is (v0)/g, where v0 is the initial vertical velocity, and g is the acceleration due to gravity, approximately 9.8 m/s². The time to come back down is the same as the time going up if it lands at the same height. So the total time in the air would be 2*(v0/g). Wait, no. Wait, that's only true if the projectile lands at the same elevation it was launched from. But in juggling, the ball is caught by the same hand that threw it, so I think it's thrown from the hand and caught at the same height, so the time of flight would be 2*(v0/g).

But wait, in our case, the total time in the air is 0.225 seconds, so 0.225 = 2*(v0/g). So solving for v0: v0 = (g * t)/2. Plugging in the numbers: (9.8 m/s² * 0.225 s)/2.

Let me calculate that. 9.8 * 0.225 is approximately... Let's see. 0.225 is 9/40, so 9.8 * 9 = 88.2; 88.2 /40 = 2.205. Wait, no: 9.8 * 0.225. Let me do it step by step. 0.2 *9.8 is 1.96, 0.02 *9.8 is 0.196, 0.005 *9.8 is 0.049. Adding them up: 1.96 + 0.196 = 2.156 + 0.049 = 2.205 m/s. Then divide by 2: 2.205 /2 = 1.1025 m/s.

Wait, that's way too low. But looking at the answer choices, the options are all way higher, like 8, 10, etc. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I got the time wrong. Maybe the time of flight isn't 0.9 seconds, but longer. Let me think again. The problem says it takes 0.9 seconds to cycle each ball through his hands, including catching, transferring, and throwing, and to be ready to catch the next ball. So the total cycle time is 0.9 seconds. So if the clown is juggling four balls, each time he throws a ball, the next ball is caught after 0.9 seconds.

Wait, maybe the time the ball is in the air is the same as the cycle time. So the time each ball is in the air is 0.9 seconds. Then the time to go up and come down would be 0.9 seconds, so the time to reach the peak is 0.45 seconds. Then the initial velocity would be v0 = g * t, where t is the time to reach the peak. So v0 = 9.8 * 0.45 = 4.41 m/s. But that's still much lower than the options given.

Hmm, this doesn't make sense. There's something wrong here. Let me think again.

Wait, in juggling, the formula for the time of flight of each ball is T = (2 v0 sin(theta)) / g, but assuming theta is 90 degrees (thrown straight up), sin(theta) is 1, so T = 2 v0 / g.

Wait, in that case, if T is the time of flight, then v0 = (g T ) / 2.

But if the cycle time is 0.9 seconds, and each ball is in the air for 0.9 seconds, then:

v0 = (9.8 * 0.9 ) / 2 = (8.82)/2 = 4.41 m/s. But again, this is way below the options given.

Wait, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the cycle time is the time between catches, but in a four-ball juggling pattern, each ball is thrown in such a way that it's in the air longer. Because for each cycle, the number of throws is equal to the number of balls, so the time between throws is T = 0.9 /4 = 0.225 seconds.

Wait, no, perhaps the cycle time is the time for each throw. So each throw happens every 0.9 seconds. So the time a ball is in the air would be the time until the next throw is made. So for four balls, each ball is in the air for the same amount of time as the cycle time. Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the time each ball is in the air is equal to the cycle time multiplied by the number of balls minus one. Wait, that might not make sense.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The time between each throw is the cycle time, which is 0.9 seconds. So if the clown throws a ball, then 0.9 seconds later, he throws another. But for a four-ball juggle, each ball must be in the air for a time that allows all four to be in the air at the same time. So each ball is thrown every 0.9 seconds, but the time each is in the air is longer than 0.9 seconds, because otherwise, the balls would come down before the next throw.

Wait, no, that can't be. If each ball is thrown every 0.9 seconds, then the time each ball is in the air would have to be equal to the cycle time times (number of balls). Because, for example, in a three-ball cascade, each throw is at intervals of T, and each ball is in the air for 2T, because each ball is thrown, then another after T, etc.

Wait, let me think about the cascade pattern. In a three-ball cascade, each ball is thrown higher so that each is in the air for 2T, where T is the time between throws. So if the time between throws is T, each ball is in the air for 2T, allowing the juggler to catch each ball and throw the next one every T seconds.

Ah, so in our problem, if the cycle time is 0.9 seconds, that would be the time between throws. So T = 0.9 s. Then each ball is in the air for n*T, where n is the number of balls? Or perhaps 2*T? Wait, no. Let me think: for three balls, each is in the air for 2T. So for four balls, each would be in the air for (n+1)*T / n? Or maybe it's different.

Wait, perhaps the time each ball is in the air is T*(n), where n is the number of balls. So in the three-ball cascade, each ball is in the air for 2T, which is (3-1)*T. So perhaps for four balls, each is in the air for 3T. So if T is 0.9 seconds, then the time of flight would be 3 * 0.9 = 2.7 seconds.

Wait, but that seems way too long. Let me check: in the three-ball cascade, each ball is in the air for 2T, so if T is the time between throws, then the time of flight is 2T. So for four balls, perhaps the time of flight is 3T. So if T is 0.9 s, then flight time is 2.7 s.

But if that's the case, then the initial velocity required would be (g * flight_time)/2. So flight time is 2.7 s, so v0 = (9.8 * 2.7)/2.

Calculating that: 9.8 * 2.7 = let's see, 9 * 2.7 is 24.3, 0.8 * 2.7 is 2.16, so total is 26.46. Divide by 2: 13.23 m/s. Hmm, looking at the options, option E is 13.2 m/s, which matches this.

But wait, does this make sense? Because if the time between throws is 0.9 seconds, then the time each ball is in the air is 3 * 0.9 = 2.7 seconds? That seems correct for a four-ball juggling pattern. Because each time you throw a ball, the previous one is still in the air, and with four balls, each needs to stay up long enough for the others to be thrown and caught.

So the minimum vertical speed would be (9.8 m/s² * 2.7 s)/2 = 13.23 m/s. So the closest option is E:13.2 m/s.

To determine the minimum vertical speed the clown must throw each ball, we analyze the juggling cycle. The clown takes **0.9 seconds** to cycle each ball through his hands, which is the time between throws. Since the clown is juggling **four balls**, the time each ball spends in the air is determined by the juggling pattern. 

In a cascade juggling pattern, the time a ball is in the air is proportional to the number of balls being juggled. Specifically, for **n balls**, the time of flight for each ball is approximately **(n-1) × T**, where **T** is the time between throws. Here, **T = 0.9 seconds**, and **n = 4**, so the time of flight for each ball is:

\[
t_{\text{flight}} = (4-1) \times 0.9 = 2.7 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

The minimum vertical speed required to throw the ball is determined by the time it takes to reach the peak of its trajectory and return to the same height. For a projectile launched straight up, the total time of flight is related to the initial vertical velocity \(v_0\) by:

\[
t_{\text{flight}} = \frac{2 v_0}{g},
\]

where \(g = 9.8 \, \mathrm{m/s^2}\) is the acceleration due to gravity. Solving for \(v_0\):

\[
v_0 = \frac{g \cdot t_{\text{flight}}}{2} = \frac{9.8 \cdot 2.7}{2}.
\]

Calculating this:

\[
v_0 = \frac{26.46}{2} = 13.23 \, \mathrm{m/s}.
\]

From the given options, the closest match is **13.2 m/s**, which corresponds to option **E**.
