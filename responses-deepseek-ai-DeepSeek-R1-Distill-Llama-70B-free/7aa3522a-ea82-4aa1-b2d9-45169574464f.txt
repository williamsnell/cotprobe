Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about literacy rates in 1950. The question asks what percentage of the global population was literate around that time. The options are from A to J, with various percentages.

First, I need to recall what I know about historical literacy rates. I remember that literacy has been increasing over time, especially in the 20th century. In the past, like in the 1800s, literacy was much lower, maybe around 20-30% globally. But by the 1900s, things started improving, especially after World War II.

I think after WWII, there was a big push for education and development. The United Nations and other organizations probably played a role in increasing education access. So by 1950, I guess the literacy rate had gone up but wasn't as high as today's rates, which are like over 80% globally.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are 66%, 96%, 56%, 16%, 86%, 26%, 76%, 46%, 106%, 36%. Wait, 106% doesn't make sense because literacy can't be over 100%, so I can eliminate option I.

Now, considering the time frame. In 1950, many countries were still developing. Regions like Asia, Africa, and parts of Latin America had lower literacy rates. Europe and North America were more literate. So globally, the average would be somewhere in the middle.

I've heard that in 1950, the global literacy rate was around 40-50%. So looking at the options, 36% is option J, 46% is H, 56% is C, 66% is A. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact numbers.

Wait, another way to think: The global literacy rate in 2000 was about 84%, according to some sources I've read. And it's been increasing steadily. So going back 50 years from 2000 to 1950, the rate would have been lower. Maybe around half of that? Or a bit more.

Wait, no, that's not accurate because the increase isn't linear. From 1950 onward, especially after the 60s and 70s, literacy improved a lot due to various global initiatives. So perhaps in 1950, it was around 40% or maybe a bit higher.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about specific regions. In 1950, in developed countries, literacy was probably already high, like 80-90%, while in developing countries, it was much lower, maybe 20-30%. The global average would depend on the population distribution.

In 1950, the world population was around 2.5 billion. A significant portion lived in Asia, which had lower literacy rates. So if, say, 40% of the global population was literate, that would mean about 1 billion people. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, I think I remember a specific figure. Wasn't the global literacy rate around 42% in 1950? So looking at the options, the closest one would be 46%, which is option H. Or maybe 36% is option J. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, I might have read that in 1950, the literacy rate was about 55%, but that seems high. Or maybe 36%? No, that seems too low. Let me think again.

I think in the early 20th century, around 1900, global literacy was about 20-25%. By 1950, it had increased, but not by a huge margin. So perhaps it was around 40-50%. So among the options, 46% is H, 36% is J, 56% is C. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: UNESCO reports on literacy. I think UNESCO's data shows that in 1950, the global adult literacy rate was approximately 42%. So 42% isn't an option here, but the closest option is H:46% or J:36%.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misremembering. Another thought: I've heard that in 1950, about 44% of the world's population could read and write. So again, 46% is the closest option. So the answer would be H.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing this with another year. Maybe in 1970, the rate was around 50%, so 1950 would be lower.

Alternatively, I think that in 1960, the global literacy rate was about 42%, so 1950 would be a bit lower, maybe 38-40%. So if the options are 36% (J) or 46% (H), 36% might be too low, and 46% a bit high. But perhaps 42% rounds to 40%, but that's not an option either.

Wait, looking back at the options, the closest to 42% would be either 36% or 46%. If I have to choose between them, which one is more plausible?

Considering that after 1950, the rate increased. So if in 1960 it was 42%, then 1950 might have been a little lower, say 38-40%. So 36% is option J, which is close but perhaps a bit low.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual figure is higher. Maybe I'm underestimating. Let me think of another approach. Let's say that in 2015, global literacy was about 86%, and it's been rising steadily. So in 1950, it was roughly half that? So around 43% perhaps.

Wait, that's not exactly half, but considering the growth rate, it might make sense. So 46% would be option H, which is close to 43%. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, I've heard that in the mid-20th century, the literacy rate was about 35-40%. So maybe 36% is the intended answer here, which is option J.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting possibilities. Another approach: think about the options. The options are A:66%, B:96%, C:56%, D:16%, E:86%, F:26%, G:76%, H:46%, J:36%.

If I eliminate the extremes, like 96% and 86% are too high for 1950. Similarly, 16% is too low. So we're left with 26%, 36%, 46%, 56%, 66%, 76%. 

From what I know, 26% seems too low for 1950. 36% is possible. 46% is plausible. 56% might be on the higher side but possible. 66% seems high for 1950.

So between 36%, 46%, and 56%. Now, I think that the global literacy rate in 1950 was around 42%, so 46% is the closest. Therefore, the answer would be H:46%.

But wait, another thought: Maybe the question is about the percentage of the population that was literate, not adults. Because sometimes literacy rates are measured for all people or just adults. If it's all people, including children who might not have been schooled yet, the rate would be lower. But I think the standard measure is for adults aged 15 and above.

Assuming that, in 1950, the adult literacy rate was around 42%, so the closest option is 46% (H). Alternatively, if the figure was 36%, then J would be correct.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall any specific data points. I remember reading that in 1950, about 40% of the world's population was literate. So 40% isn't an option, but 46% is H and 36% is J.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct figure is 56%, which is option C. But that seems higher than what I remember.

Wait, I think I found a source once that said in 1950, the global literacy rate was approximately 56%. No, that doesn't sound right. Maybe it was 42% in 1960, so 1950 would be a bit lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are based on some approximate data, and 36% is the intended answer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think differently. If in 1900, literacy was about 20%, and by 1950, it had increased, but not by much, maybe to around 35-40%. So 36% is option J, which might be the intended answer.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: think about regions. Let's say in 1950, Europe and North America had high literacy rates, maybe 80-90%. But much of Asia, Africa, and Latin America had lower rates. If we assume that about a third of the world's population was in the high-literacy areas, contributing maybe 80% literacy, and the rest in lower areas with, say, 20% literacy.

So global literacy would be (1/3 * 80) + (2/3 * 20) = (80/3) + (40/3) = 120/3 = 40%. So approximately 40% globally. So the closest option is 36% (J) or 46% (H). 40% isn't an option, but 36% is closer than 46%.

Wait, but maybe the distribution isn't exactly a third. Let's say half the population was in regions with 20% literacy and half with 80%. Then it would be (0.5 *80)+(0.5*20) = 50% literacy. But that's higher than I thought.

Alternatively, perhaps the majority of the population was in lower-literacy regions. Let's say 70% of the population had 20% literacy and 30% had 80%. Then it's (0.7*20)+(0.3*80) = 14 +24=38%. So around 38%, which again isn't an option, but closer to 36% than 46%.

Hmm. So considering that, 36% might be the intended answer, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the actual figure is higher, and the answer is 46%. I'm a bit torn here.

Wait, another thought: I think the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has reported that the global adult literacy rate in 1950 was approximately 42%. So if that's the case, the closest option is 46% (H). But since 42 isn't an option, 46% is the next best choice.

Alternatively, perhaps the figure is 36%, but I might be mixing it up with an earlier year, like 1900, which was around 20-30%.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the options are in whole numbers. If the actual figure is 42%, the closest option is 46% (H). So I'll go with H:46%.

The question asks about the global literacy rate in 1950. To determine the correct answer, the analysis begins by recalling historical trends in literacy rates. Literacy has increased significantly over time, particularly in the 20th century, driven by global education initiatives. By 1950, literacy rates were higher than in the 19th century but lower than today's rates, which exceed 80%.

The options provided are:  
A: 66%, B: 96%, C: 56%, D: 16%, E: 86%, F: 26%, G: 76%, H: 46%, I: 106%, J: 36%.  

Option I (106%) is immediately eliminated, as literacy rates cannot exceed 100%. The remaining options are evaluated based on historical data. In 1950, global literacy was estimated to be around 40-42%, with regional variations. Developed countries had higher literacy rates (80-90%), while developing regions had much lower rates (20-30%). The global average was influenced by the population distribution, with a significant portion living in lower-literacy regions.

Considering the options, 36% (J) and 46% (H) are the closest to the estimated 40-42%. While 36% might seem plausible, it is slightly lower than the commonly cited figure of 42%. Therefore, 46% (H) is the most reasonable choice, as it aligns closely with historical estimates and is the nearest option to 42%.

Answer: H
