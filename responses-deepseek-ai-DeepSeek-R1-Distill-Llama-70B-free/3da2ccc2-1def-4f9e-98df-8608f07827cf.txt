Question:

A farmer wants to know whether a new fertilizer has increased the mean weight of his apples. With the old fertilizer, the mean weight was 4.0 ounces per apple. The farmer decides to test H0: μ = 4.0 ounces versus Ha : μ > 4.0 ounces, at a 5 percent level of significance, where μ = the mean weight of apples using the new fertilizer. The weights of apples are approximately normally distributed. The farmer takes a random sample of 16 apples and computes a mean of 4.3 ounces and a standard deviation of 0.6 ounces. Which of the following gives the p-value for this test?

Options:

A: P(Z > 2)
B: P(Z < 2)
C: P(Z > 2) with 16 degrees of freedom
D: P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom
E: P(t < 2) with 15 degrees of freedom
F: P(Z < 1.5)
G: P(Z > 1.5)
H: P(t > 1.5) with 15 degrees of freedom
I: P(t < 2) with 16 degrees of freedom
J: P(t < 1.5) with 15 degrees of freedom

Okay, so I have this statistics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The farmer is testing whether a new fertilizer has increased the mean weight of his apples. The old fertilizer had a mean weight of 4.0 ounces. The hypotheses are H0: μ = 4.0 versus Ha: μ > 4.0. The significance level is 5%. The farmer took a sample of 16 apples, got a mean of 4.3 ounces, and a standard deviation of 0.6 ounces. The question is about finding the correct p-value for this test, and selecting the right option from A to J.

Alright, so first I need to think about what kind of test this is. Since the farmer is comparing a sample mean to a known population mean, and we're dealing with a hypothesis test for the mean, this sounds like a t-test or a z-test.

I remember that the choice between z and t depends on whether the population standard deviation is known. If it's known, we use z. If not, we use t. In this case, the problem gives the standard deviation of the sample, which is 0.6 ounces. Hmm, wait, but is that the population std dev or sample? Oh, right, the sample standard deviation is given because the population parameters are usually unknown when conducting such tests. So, since the population std dev is unknown, we should use the t-test.

Wait, but wait another thing. The sample size is 16. So the degrees of freedom for the t-test would be n-1, which is 15. So that's something to note.

Now, the hypotheses are H0: μ = 4.0 versus Ha: μ >4.0. So this is a one-tailed test, specifically a right-tailed test because the alternative is that the mean is greater than 4.0.

So, to calculate the test statistic, for a t-test, the formula is (sample mean - population mean) divided by (sample standard deviation divided by sqrt(n)). So plugging in the numbers:

Sample mean (x̄) = 4.3, population mean (μ0) = 4.0. Sample standard deviation (s) = 0.6, n=16.

So the t-statistic t = (4.3 - 4.0)/(0.6 / sqrt(16)).

Wait, sqrt(16) is 4, so denominator is 0.6 /4 = 0.15.

So numerator is 0.3. So t = 0.3 / 0.15 = 2.0.

So the t-score is 2.0.

Since this is a right-tailed test, the p-value is the probability that t is greater than 2.0, with 15 degrees of freedom.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option D says P(t>2) with 15 df.

Option H is P(t>1.5) with 15. No, because our t is 2.0.

Wait, are there any other options with t>2? Let's check all.

Option D: correct, it's t>2 with 15 df.

Option A is Z>2, which is for large samples. But our sample size is 16, which is small, so we use t, not Z. So A and B are about Z, which we can rule out.

Options C is Z>2 with 16 df. Wait, no, because Z tests don't use degrees of freedom. Plus, we should be using t here.

Options D is correct.

Wait another thing, but wait: sometimes, some textbooks consider that when n is large (like over 30), you can use Z. But 16 is small, so definitely t-test.

So the correct option is D: P(t>2) with 15 degrees of freedom.

The farmer is testing whether a new fertilizer has increased the mean weight of apples, with hypotheses \( H_0: \mu = 4.0 \) versus \( H_a: \mu > 4.0 \), at a 5% significance level. The sample mean is 4.3 ounces, the sample standard deviation is 0.6 ounces, and the sample size is 16. Since the population standard deviation is unknown, a t-test is appropriate. The degrees of freedom are \( n-1 = 15 \).

The t-statistic is calculated as:

\[
t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} = \frac{4.3 - 4.0}{0.6 / \sqrt{16}} = \frac{0.3}{0.15} = 2.0
\]

This is a right-tailed test, so the p-value is \( P(t > 2) \) with 15 degrees of freedom. Among the options, only **D** matches this description.

Answer: D
