Question:

A husband and wife were about to leave on vacation for one month. They thought it would be a great idea to have new carpeting installed in their home while they were away. They contacted a reputable carpeting company, which offered to do the job for $7,000. The husband and wife agreed, gave a set of house keys to the carpeting company, and left on vacation. A week later, the carpeting company discovered that they had overbooked their installation staff and could not finish all of the jobs for which they had contracted. The carpeting company contacted a workman whom they had used before, and told him about the job they were to perform for the husband and wife. The workman agreed to do the installation in exchange for the payment from the husband and wife. When the husband and wife returned from vacation, they were happy with the work and sent a check for $7,000 to the carpeting company, which deposited the check. If the workman now seeks to recover for services he performed, he will

Options:

A: not recover, because he agreed to perform the services without a direct contract with the husband and wife.
B: recover against the husband and wife only.
C: not recover, because the carpeting company already received payment.
D: recover against the carpeting company only.
E: not recover, because he did not have a written contract.
F: recover against the carpeting company, because they were the ones who contracted him.
G: recover against the husband and wife, because they were the ultimate beneficiaries of his work.
H: not recover, because he was not in privity of contract.
I: recover against both the husband and wife and the carpeting company.
J: recover against either the husband and wife or the carpeting company.

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about contract law, specifically dealing with third-party beneficiaries. Let me try to break it down. 

The scenario is that a husband and wife hire a carpeting company for $7,000 to install new carpet while they're away on vacation. They gave the company the keys. The company then realizes they're overbooked and can't finish the job. So they contact a workman they've used before and ask him to do the installation. The workman agrees, and the payment comes from the husband and wife to the carpeting company, which they deposit.

Now, the workman is trying to recover payment for his services. The question is, can he recover, and from whom?

Let me think about the concepts involved here. So, when a party to a contract (here, the carpeting company) delegates their duties to a third party (the workman), the delegatee (workman) usually doesn't have a right to sue the original obligee (husband and wife) unless they are a third-party beneficiary.

In contract law, a third-party beneficiary is someone who isn't a party to the contract but is intended to benefit from it. If the contract is made with the intent that the third party can enforce it, then they can sue. So, when the carpeting company contracted the workman to do the job, which was their duty under the main contract with the homeowners, the workman's position depends on whether he was intended as the beneficiary.

Wait, but in delegation, the primary duty is on the delegate (carpeting company) to pay the delegatee (workman). Unless the parties agreed that the workman would be paid directly by the homeowners, the workman's recourse is against the carpeting company. 

So the main contract here is between the homeowners and the carpeting company. The workman was subcontracted by the carpeting company. Normally, the subcontractor (workman) would look to the contractor (carpeting company) for payment. The homeowners paid the carpeting company, so their obligation is fulfilled. 

But could the workman be considered a third-party beneficiary of the original contract? Probably not, because the original contract was between the homeowners and the carpeting company. The workman is an independent contractor hired by the carpeting company, so the homeowners aren't directly liable to him unless there's an express agreement.

In the given situation, the workman agreed to do the installation for payment from the homeowners, but wait, noâ€”the scenario says the workman agreed to do the installation in exchange for payment from the husband and wife. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: "the workman agreed to do the installation in exchange for the payment from the husband and wife." Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Because if the workman's payment is to come from the husband and wife, does that create a direct obligation between them?

Wait, no, the husband and wife already paid the carpeting company. The workman is being paid by the carpeting company, or is he? Let me re-read that part. Oh wait, no: the situation says that when the husband and wife returned, they were happy and sent a check to the carpeting company, which deposited it. So the workman was to be paid by the carpeting company, but perhaps there's an understanding that the payment comes from the homeowners.

Wait, the initial agreement between the workman and the carpeting company was that the workman would do the job in exchange for the payment from the husband and wife. So does that mean the workman's payment comes directly from the husband and wife, or through the carpeting company?

Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. If the workman was hired by the carpeting company but with the understanding that the payment would come from the homeowners, that might imply that the workman is a third-party beneficiary. Because the carpeting company and the workman agreed that the workman would be paid by the homeowners. So the homeowners' payment to the carpeting company would then be passed on to the workman. But the problem says the husband and wife sent the check to the carpeting company, which deposited it. So if the workman is to be paid out of that, perhaps there's an issue of the carpeting company not paying him.

Wait, but the workman is trying to recover. So he's probably not been paid by the carpeting company. So his options are to sue either the homeowners or the carpeting company.

If the original contract between the homeowners and the carpeting company was for the carpeting company to install the carpet, and the carpeting company subcontracted the work, then the workman's claim would typically be against the carpeting company. Because in the eyes of the law, the homeowners' obligation is to the carpeting company, and the carpeting company's obligation is to the workman.

But wait, the question is whether the workman can recover from the homeowners. For the workman to be a third-party beneficiary, the original contract (homeowners and carpeting company) must have intended that the workman can enforce payment. But in this case, the workman wasn't part of that original contract. The original contract was for the carpeting company to do the work. The workman was brought in by the carpeting company, so the workman's right is against the carpeting company, not the homeowners.

Alternatively, if the workman's agreement was with the carpeting company, then the workman is a subcontractor. Subcontractors can't generally sue the original client unless there's an assignment or they are a third-party beneficiary.

So in this case, the workman and the carpeting company had an agreement where the workman would do the work, and the carpeting company would pay him from the $7,000 they received from the homeowners. If the carpeting company didn't pay the workman, the workman can sue the carpeting company for breach of contract. The homeowners have already paid the carpeting company, so the workman can't get anything from them.

Looking at the options:

A: Not recover because no direct contract with homeowners. That's possible, but I'm not sure.

B: Recover against homeowners only. I don't think so.

C: Not recover because company already received payment. But the company has the money; the workman might have a claim against them.

D: Recover against company only. This seems likely.

E: Not recover because no written contract. But the question doesn't indicate that it's required here.

F: Recover against company because they contracted him. That's correct, but option D says the same.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: Recover against carpeting company only.

Option F: Recover against carpeting company because they contracted him.

Wait, perhaps both D and F are similar. Wait, let me read the options correctly.

Wait, the options are:

A: not recover, because he agreed to perform the services without a direct contract with the husband and wife.

B: recover against the husband and wife only.

C: not recover, because the carpeting company already received payment.

D: recover against the carpeting company only.

E: not recover, because he did not have a written contract.

F: recover against the carpeting company, because they were the ones who contracted him.

G: recover against the husband and wife, because they were the ultimate beneficiaries of his work.

H: not recover, because he was not in privity of contract.

I: recover against both the husband and wife and the carpeting company.

J: recover against either the husband and wife or the carpeting company.

So, the workman's agreement is with the carpeting company. So he can recover against them. So the options D and F are both about the company.

But wait, perhaps the workman can't recover from the company because the company already received the payment. Wait, no, the company has the $7k, so if they contracted the workman to do the job, they are obliged to pay him. So the workman can sue the company for the $7k or whatever the agreed rate was.

So the correct answer is D or F.

Wait, F says "recover against the carpeting company, because they were the ones who contracted him." That's correct.

But D says "recover against the carpeting company only."

Wait, but the question is, can the workman recover? So yes, he can recover from the company.

So the answer is D or F.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct one is D: recover against the carpeting company only.

Wait, the workman's contract is with the carpeting company, so he can only recover from them.

But let me think about third-party beneficiary. Suppose the workman was intended to be the beneficiary of the original contract between the homeowners and the carpeting company. Then he could sue the homeowners. But I don't think that's the case here.

The original contract was between the homeowners and the carpeting company. The workman is a subcontractor. So the workman's right is against the carpeting company.

So the answer should be D: recover against the carpeting company only.

Looking at the options, option D is correct.

The question revolves around contract law, specifically the ability of a subcontractor (the workman) to recover payment for services performed. The key facts are as follows:

1. The husband and wife contracted with the carpeting company for $7,000 to install carpet.
2. The carpeting company, unable to complete the job, hired the workman to perform the installation.
3. The workman agreed to perform the services, and the payment was to come from the husband and wife.
4. The husband and wife paid the carpeting company $7,000, which was deposited, but the workman now seeks to recover for his services.

Under contract law, the workman, as a subcontractor, generally cannot recover directly from the original clients (the husband and wife) unless he is an intended third-party beneficiary of the original contract. Here, the original contract was between the husband and wife and the carpeting company, and the workman was hired by the carpeting company as a subcontractor. The workmanâ€™s agreement was with the carpeting company, not the husband and wife, and there is no indication that the original contract intended the workman to be a third-party beneficiary.

The husband and wife fulfilled their obligation by paying the carpeting company, and the workmanâ€™s right to payment lies with the carpeting company, which delegated the work to him. Therefore, the workman can recover against the carpeting company only.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The lack of a direct contract with the husband and wife does not bar recovery because the workmanâ€™s agreement was with the carpeting company.
- **B**: Incorrect. The workman cannot recover against the husband and wife only, as they were not party to the workmanâ€™s agreement.
- **C**: Incorrect. The carpeting companyâ€™s receipt of payment does not bar the workmanâ€™s claim; the workmanâ€™s right is against the carpeting company.
- **D**: Correct. The workman can recover against the carpeting company only, as they were the ones who contracted him.
- **E**: Incorrect. The absence of a written contract is irrelevant, as oral contracts are enforceable in this context.
- **F**: Incorrect. While the carpeting company contracted the workman, this does not change the fact that the workman can only recover against the carpeting company.
- **G**: Incorrect. The workman cannot recover against the husband and wife, as they were not party to his agreement.
- **H**: Incorrect. The doctrine of privity of contract does not apply here, as the workmanâ€™s claim is against the carpeting company.
- **I**: Incorrect. The workman cannot recover against both parties; his right is solely against the carpeting company.
- **J**: Incorrect. The workman cannot recover against either party; his claim is limited to the carpeting company.

The correct answer is **D**: recover against the carpeting company only.

D
