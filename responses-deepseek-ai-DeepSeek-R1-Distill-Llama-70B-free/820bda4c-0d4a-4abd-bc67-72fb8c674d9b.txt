Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem to solve, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about calculating the change in entropy when 25 kJ of energy is transferred reversibly and isothermally as heat to a large block of iron at 100 degrees Celsius. The options are from A to J, each with different entropy values in J/(K).

Hmm, I remember that entropy change (ΔS) for a reversible, isothermal process can be calculated using the formula ΔS = q_rev / T, where q_rev is the heat transferred and T is the absolute temperature. But wait, I need to make sure I'm getting all the units right.

First, the temperature given is 100°C. Oh right, I should convert that to Kelvin because thermodynamic equations usually require absolute temperature. So 100°C is 373.15 K. Let me double-check that. Yeah, because 0°C is 273.15 K, so adding 100 gives 373.15 K.

Next, the heat transferred is 25 kJ. Oh wait, that's kilojoules. I need to convert that to joules because the standard unit for entropy is J/(K). So 25 kJ is 25,000 J. But wait, the question says the heat is being transferred to the iron. So q is positive here because heat is added to the system (the iron block).

Wait, but I should make sure about the sign. Oh right, when heat is added reversibly and isothermally, the entropy change is positive for the system. So ΔS will be positive here.

Now, plugging into the formula: ΔS = q_rev / T. So that's 25,000 J divided by 373.15 K. Let me compute that.

Let me calculate that division. 25,000 / 373.15. Hmm, 373.15 times 67 is approximately 25,000? Let me check: 373 * 67. Let's see: 370 * 67 is 24,790. Then 3*67 is 201, so total is 24,991. Oh wait, that's about 24,991, which is almost 25,000. So 67 would give us approximately 24,991 J, which is very close to 25,000. So 25,000 / 373.15 is approximately 67 J/K.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 67 J/K^-1. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake.

Wait another approach: 373.15 is approximately 373. Let's compute 25,000 / 373. Let's see, 373 * 67 is 24,991, as before. So 25,000 - 24,991 = 9 J left. So 67 would give us 24,991, so the exact value is slightly more than 67. Let me calculate 25,000 / 373.15.

Let me compute 25,000 ÷ 373.15. Let me use a calculator approach.

373.15 times 67 is 24,991.95. Wait, 67 * 373.15 = ?

Well, 373.15 * 60 = 22,389.

373.15 * 7 = 2,612.05.

So 22,389 + 2,612.05 = 25,001.05. Oh wait, that's actually a bit over 25,000.

So 67 * 373.15 = 25,001.05, which is just a bit more than 25,000. So 25,000 would be 67 minus a tiny fraction. So 25,000 / 373.15 = approximately 67.0.

Wait, but why does that give me 67? So the entropy change is approximately 67 J/K.

Looking back at the options, option H is 67 J/K^-1. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I get the formula right? Because sometimes, when heat is transferred to the surroundings, the sign changes. But in this case, the heat is being transferred to the iron, so the system is the iron. So q is positive, and so the entropy change of the system (ΔS) is positive as well. So the calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, sometimes when you have an isothermal process for an ideal gas, the entropy change is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1), but that's for gases. Here, it's a solid iron block. Oh wait, the question says to assume all gases are perfect, but here it's a solid. Hmm, but when dealing with heat transfer to a solid, the entropy change is still q_rev / T, regardless of the substance, as long as the process is reversible and isothermal. So the formula applies here.

Wait, wait, no. Wait a minute. The process is isothermal, so the temperature of the iron doesn't change. But iron is a solid, so for a solid, the heat capacity is different. But in this case, the process is isothermal, so the formula ΔS = q/T should still hold because it's a reversible process. Because for any reversible process, the entropy change is the integral of dQ_rev / T.

So regardless of whether it's a solid, liquid, or gas, the formula ΔS = q_rev / T holds for a reversible isothermal process. So that's correct.

Therefore, the correct answer should be 67 J/K, which is option H.

To calculate the change in entropy when 25 kJ of energy is transferred reversibly and isothermally as heat to a large block of iron at \(100^\circ \mathrm{C}\), we use the formula:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{q_{\text{rev}}}{T}
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperature to Kelvin
The temperature is given as \(100^\circ \mathrm{C}\). Converting to Kelvin:

\[
T = 100 + 273.15 = 373.15 \, \mathrm{K}
\]

### Step 2: Convert heat to joules
The heat transferred is \(25 \, \mathrm{kJ}\), which is:

\[
q_{\text{rev}} = 25,000 \, \mathrm{J}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate entropy change
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\Delta S = \frac{25,000}{373.15}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\Delta S \approx 67 \, \mathrm{J} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1}
\]

### Step 4: Verify the formula's applicability
The formula \(\Delta S = \frac{q_{\text{rev}}}{T}\) is valid for any reversible isothermal process, regardless of whether the substance is a solid, liquid, or gas. Since the process is isothermal and reversible, the calculation is correct.

### Final Answer
The entropy change is approximately \(67 \, \mathrm{J} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1}\), which corresponds to option **H**.
