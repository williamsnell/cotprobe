Okay, so I have this question about the visible spectrum of a star viewed through a cloud of cool hydrogen gas. Hmm, I need to figure out what happens in this scenario. Let me think through what I know about stellar spectra and how different materials affect the light we observe.

I remember that when we look at a star's spectrum, it's usually a blackbody spectrum, which is a continuous range of colors (or wavelengths) because the star emits light across the visible spectrum. But sometimes there are absorption or emission lines superimposed on this continuum. These lines come from the elements in the star's atmosphere or from any material that the light passes through on its way to us.

So in this case, the star's light is passing through a cloud of cool hydrogen gas. What does that do? I think about how cool hydrogen behaves. If the gas is cool, it's not emitting much light. Instead, it's more likely to absorb light. But wait, when a gas is at a lower temperature, it can only absorb specific wavelengths corresponding to the energy transitions of its electrons.

I recall that in stellar atmospheres, if a star has certain elements, those elements can cause absorption lines in the spectrum. These are called absorption lines because the star's own atmosphere absorbs certain wavelengths, creating dark lines in the spectrum. But in this case, it's not the star's atmosphere we're looking at—it's a separate cloud of hydrogen gas that the starlight passes through.

So when the starlight passes through this cool hydrogen gas, the hydrogen atoms will absorb certain wavelengths from the star's continuous spectrum. The wavelengths absorbed are those that correspond to the energy levels of hydrogen. For example, the Balmer series in hydrogen includes lines like H-alpha, H-beta, etc., which are in the visible range. So these absorption lines would appear as dark lines in the star's spectrum.

Wait, but if the hydrogen gas is cool, does it emit any light? Emission lines happen when the gas is hot and ionized, like in emission nebulae. In those cases, the gas emits light as the electrons transition between energy levels. But since this gas is cool, it's probably neutral hydrogen and not emitting much. So we wouldn't see emission lines from the cloud itself.

So the star's spectrum is a blackbody continuum. As its light passes through the hydrogen cloud, certain wavelengths get absorbed, creating absorption lines. Therefore, the observed spectrum would have the star's blackbody spectrum with absorption lines due to hydrogen.

Looking at the options, option G says "You see the star's blackbody spectrum with absorption lines due to hydrogen." That matches what I was thinking.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing absorption and emission. So if the gas is in front of the star and cooler than the star, it absorbs. If it were hotter, it might emit, but that's not the case here. So yes, absorption lines are correct.

Other options: option A suggests emission lines from hydrogen. No, that's when the gas is hot. Option E is only emission lines, which doesn't fit. Option D says no lines due to hydrogen, but that's not right because the cloud would absorb. Option G is the correct one.

When observing the visible spectrum of a star through a cloud of cool hydrogen gas, the star's light passes through the cloud, and the hydrogen absorbs specific wavelengths corresponding to its energy transitions. This results in absorption lines superimposed on the star's blackbody spectrum. Since the hydrogen gas is cool, it does not emit light, so no emission lines are observed. The correct description is that the star's blackbody spectrum is seen with absorption lines due to hydrogen.

Answer: G
