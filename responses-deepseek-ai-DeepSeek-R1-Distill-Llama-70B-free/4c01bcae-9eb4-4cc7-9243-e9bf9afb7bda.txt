Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which state has jurisdiction over crimes committed on board vessels. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my international law, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking about the ordinary jurisdiction for crimes on vessels. I remember that ships operate under different jurisdictions depending on where they are. So, when a ship is in international waters, I think the flag state has jurisdiction. The flag state is the country where the ship is registered, right? So if a crime happens on a ship in the middle of the ocean, it's the flag state's responsibility to deal with it.

Wait, but what if the ship is in the territorial waters of another country? Then the coastal state, which is the country whose waters the ship is in, might have some jurisdiction. But the question says "ordinarily," so I think that's the usual case when the ship is on the high seas, not in someone's territorial waters.

Looking at the options, option I is the flag State. That makes sense because the flag state generally has jurisdiction over its vessels wherever they are, unless they're in another state's waters where that state might assert jurisdiction.

Other options: Option D is the port state. I think port states can have some jurisdiction, especially when the ship is docked there, but it's not the ordinary case. Option H is the coastal state, which would apply in their own waters. Option A says all states, which doesn't make sense because that would lead to conflicts. C is IMO, but that's an organization, not a state. E is the UN, which isn't a state either. F is destination state, G origin, J is a tribunal. So those don't fit the primary jurisdiction.

So putting it all together, the flag state (option I) is the one that ordinarily exercises jurisdiction over crimes on its vessels.

The flag State ordinarily exercises jurisdiction over crimes committed on board its vessels, as it is responsible for the ship's regulation under international law, especially when the vessel is on the high seas. This jurisdiction applies regardless of the ship's location unless another state's territorial waters are involved.

Answer: I
