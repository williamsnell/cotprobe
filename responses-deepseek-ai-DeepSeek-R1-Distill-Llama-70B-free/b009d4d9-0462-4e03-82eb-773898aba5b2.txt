Question:

A first-class passenger on an airplane flight from Atlanta to Chicago was seated next to a middle-aged salesman who was returning home after attending a business convention in Atlanta. The passenger, who was extremely exhausted after a long and hectic day, tried to sleep during the flight but was constantly being annoyed by the salesman. Once the flight departed, the salesman started ordering drinks of Scotch and water from the flight attendant, and became inebriated. When the passenger refused to talk to him, the salesman became very abusive to the passenger. Although there were many empty seats available on the plane in the first-class section, the passenger decided to remain seated next to the salesman. Finally, after the flight attendant had served the saleman his tenth drink of Scotch, he became belligerent and punched the passenger in the mouth. The passenger's two front teeth were knocked loose and she suffered a cut lip. If the passenger asserts a claim against the airline based on negligence, she will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because, as a first-class passenger, she was owed a special duty of care by the airline.
B: prevail, because the flight attendant should have been aware that her conduct caused an unjustifiable risk of harm.
C: not prevail, because the airline cannot control the actions of its passengers.
D: not prevail, because the passenger could have asked for assistance from the flight crew.
E: not prevail, because the passenger did not communicate her discomfort to the airline staff.
F: not prevail, because the passenger assumed the risk by not moving to another seat away from the salesman.
G: not prevail, because the airline is not vicariously liable for the tortious conduct of its passengers.

Okay, so I've got this question about airline negligence, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is a first-class passenger on a flight from Atlanta to Chicago. She's sitting next to a salesman who becomes drunk and abusive. Despite there being empty seats, she stays put. After the tenth drink, he punches her, causing injuries. She's suing the airline for negligence.

First, I need to remember what negligence entails. Generally, negligence requires the plaintiff to prove that the defendant owed a duty of care, breached that duty, and as a result, caused the plaintiff's harm.

In this case, the airline's duty is to provide a safe environment for passengers. But what's the extent of that duty? I think airlines are generally not liable for the actions of their passengers unless the airline was somehow negligent in allowing the situation to occur.

So the key here is whether the airline could have foreseen the harm and taken steps to prevent it. The flight attendants were serving the salesman multiple drinks, which led to his intoxication. The passenger didn't ask for help, even though there were empty seats available.

I remember that in some cases, if the airline staff knows or should have known that a passenger is becoming a threat, they might have a duty to intervene. For example, if a passenger is visibly intoxicated and acting aggressively, the airline might be negligent if they continue to serve drinks and don't take steps to protect others.

Looking at the options:

Option A says she'll prevail because she's first-class and owed a special duty. I don't think first-class changes the duty much. The duty is generally the same regardless of class, so A might not be correct.

Option B says she'll prevail because the flight attendant should have known the risk. This sounds plausible. If the attendant kept serving drinks despite the salesman's behavior, the airline might have been negligent.

Option C says the airline can't control passengers, so she won't prevail. But that's not entirely true. The airline does have some responsibility to manage passenger behavior, especially when serving alcohol.

Option D suggests she didn't ask for help, so she loses. But I don't think the passenger's inaction necessarily bars her claim. The question is whether the airline should have acted regardless.

Option E is similar, saying she didn't communicate her discomfort. Again, maybe the airline should have noticed the problem without her saying anything.

Option F says she assumed the risk by not moving. I don't think assumption of risk applies here because moving wasn't necessarily a reasonable expectation, especially since the airline should have managed the situation.

Option G states the airline isn't vicariously liable for passengers' torts. That's true in many cases, but if the airline was negligent in their own actions (like serving too many drinks), then they could be liable.

Putting it together, the main issue is whether the flight attendant should have stopped serving drinks when the salesman became a risk. If so, the airline breached their duty, leading to the injury. So the correct answer would be B. The flight attendant should have been aware of the risk, making the airline negligent.

The question revolves around whether the airline can be held negligent for the harm caused by an intoxicated passenger. Negligence requires the defendant to owe a duty of care, breach it, and cause harm as a result. Airlines have a duty to provide a safe environment, which includes managing risks posed by passengers, particularly when serving alcohol.

The key issue is whether the flight attendant should have recognized the risk posed by the salesman's increasing intoxication and taken steps to prevent harm. Serving multiple drinks to an already inebriated passenger who was becoming abusive could constitute a breach of duty. The passenger's decision not to move or ask for help does not necessarily absolve the airline of liability if the staff should have intervened.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The duty of care is not heightened for first-class passengers.
- **B**: Correct. The flight attendant should have recognized the risk of harm and intervened.
- **C**: Incorrect. Airlines can control certain aspects of passenger behavior, such as alcohol service.
- **D**: Incorrect. The passenger's inaction does not bar her claim if the airline was negligent.
- **E**: Incorrect. The airline should have noticed the issue without the passenger's communication.
- **F**: Incorrect. Assumption of risk does not apply here.
- **G**: Incorrect. The airline could be liable if its own actions (serving drinks) were negligent.

The correct answer is **B**, as the flight attendant should have been aware of the risk and taken action to prevent harm.
