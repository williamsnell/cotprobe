Question:

A housing corporation owned farmland and prepared a development plan to divide the land into 100 lots and create a residential community on the farmland tract. The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, as an administrative entity, to which the residential community lot owners would pay dues, and which would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the restrictions set forth in the Declaration of Covenants provides that the lots be used only for single-family residences, and that no trade, commerce, or business may be conducted in any single-family residence. The Declaration of Covenants gives the community association the right to assign all of its rights, powers, titles, easements, and estates granted to it under the Declaration of Covenants. The community association assigned "all the rights, powers, titles, easements, and estates granted to or conferred upon it by the Declaration of Covenants" to a municipal corporation, the city. The community association was then terminated. A chef, the owner of lot 18 in the residential development, proposes to convert his single-family dwelling into a massage parlor. The city asserts an action against the chef to recover money damages. Which of the following is the best argument for the chef?

Options:

A: The restraint on alienation of his land is invalid.
B: The Declaration of Covenants is unenforceable because it is overly restrictive.
C: The Declaration of Covenants does not explicitly prohibit the conversion of single-family dwellings into businesses.
D: The chef has the right to use his property as he sees fit, regardless of the Declaration of Covenants.
E: The benefit is in gross; hence, the burden cannot run.
F: The chef was not aware of the Declaration of Covenants when he bought the property.
G: The assignment of rights to the city was invalid because the community association was terminated.
H: The burden is in gross; hence, the benefit cannot run.
I: The city is not in privity of estate with community association.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me break it down step by step.

Alright, the setup is about a housing corporation that owns farmland and wants to develop it into a residential community with 100 lots. They created a Declaration of Covenants, which sets up a community association. This association is supposed to manage the enforcement of the rules and collect dues from the lot owners. 

One of the key restrictions in the covenants is that each lot can only be used for single-family residences, and no business or commercial activities are allowed. So, no home offices, no shops, nothing like that. The declaration also gives the community association the right to assign all its rights and powers to someone else. 

In this case, the community association assigned all their rights to the city, a municipal corporation, and then the association was terminated. Now, a chef who owns lot 18 wants to turn his house into a massage parlor. The city is suing him for money damages, claiming he's violating the covenant.

The question is, what's the chef's best argument against this?

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which one applies. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says the restraint on alienation is invalid. Restraint on alienation refers to limits on the ability to sell or transfer property. I'm not sure that's directly applicable here because the issue is about use, not transferring the property.

Option B claims the Declaration is unenforceable because it's overly restrictive. I remember that covenants can be struck down if they're unreasonable, but courts usually enforce them unless they're against public policy. This one seems pretty standard for a residential area, so maybe this isn't the strongest argument.

Option C argues that the Declaration doesn't explicitly prohibit converting homes into businesses. Wait, the question says the covenant prohibits using the lots for any trade, commerce, or business. So if the chef is turning his home into a massage parlor, that's a business use. So this option might not hold because the covenant does prohibit it.

Option D says the chef can use his property as he wishes, regardless of the Declaration. But property law generally allows for covenants that restrict use, so this is probably incorrect. You can't just ignore a valid covenant.

Option E states that the benefit is in gross, so the burden can't run. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think covenants can run with the land if they meet certain criteria. A benefit in gross means it's held by someone who isn't adjacent or doesn't own the land. But the community association was the one enforcing it, and they assigned it to the city. Wait, the city isn't a neighboring landowner, so if the covenant's benefit was in gross, maybe it can't be enforced against subsequent owners. Because usually, covenants run with the land when they benefit the land, not when they're personal (in gross). So if the assignment was to the city, which is a third party not owning land in the development, maybe the burden can't run because the benefit is in gross.

Option F says the chef wasn't aware of the covenant when he bought. But generally, if the covenant is properly recorded, the buyer is bound whether they know about it or not. So this might not work unless there's an issue with notice, but the question doesn't say anything about that.

Option G argues the assignment to the city was invalid because the association was terminated. But the assignment happened before the termination, right? So the termination after assignment wouldn't invalidate the transfer. So G doesn't seem right.

Option H claims the burden is in gross, so the benefit can't run. Wait, burden in gross would mean the obligation is personal, not tied to the land. But here the burden is on the land use, so it's not in gross. I think this is the opposite of E, and probably not applicable.

Option I says the city isn't in privity of estate with the association. Privity usually refers to the relationship between the original parties. But since the association assigned their rights, maybe the city isn't in privity. However, for covenants, the main issue is whether the covenant runs with the land, not necessarily privity. So maybe I is a possible argument, but I'm not as confident.

So, focusing back on E: The benefit is in gross; hence, the burden cannot run. If the original covenant was for the benefit of the community association, which isn't tied to any specific land, then the benefit is in gross. Because the association is an administrative entity, not a landowner in the development, the benefit isn't appurtenant to any land. Therefore, the burden (the restriction) can't run with the land because the benefit is in gross.

Wait, but sometimes community associations are considered to have benefits that run with the land because they're for the common good of all lot owners. So maybe the benefit isn't in gross. Hmm, now I'm confused.

Alternatively, when the association assigned the rights to the city, which is a municipal corporation and not a landowner in the development, does that make the benefit in gross? Because the city isn't a neighboring landowner but a separate entity. If the benefit is assigned to someone who isn't a owner of land in the community, then the benefit is in gross, and the burden can't run.

So the chef's argument would be that the city, as the assignee, holds the benefit in gross, so the covenant can't be enforced against him. That would make E the correct answer.

Another angle: for a covenant to run with the land at common law (assuming it's a real covenant), the burden and benefit must touch and concern the land, horizontal privity, and vertical privity. But when the benefit is assigned to a third party not owning land, the vertical privity might not exist for the assignee.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. The key point is whether the benefit is in gross. If the original covenant was intended for the community association, which serves all the lot owners, then each lot owner benefits. But when the association assigns it to the city, which isn't a lot owner, the benefit is no longer appurtenant to any land. So it's in gross, meaning the burden can't run. So the city can't enforce it because they don't have the benefit appurtenant to land.

So the best argument is E.

The case revolves around a residential development governed by a Declaration of Covenants, which restricts lot usage to single-family residences and prohibits commercial activities. The community association, tasked with enforcing these covenants, assigned its rights to the city, a municipal corporation, before being terminated. A chef, owning lot 18, plans to convert his home into a massage parlor, prompting the city to sue for enforcement of the covenant. The question asks for the chef's best argument against the city's action.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: This argues that the covenant constitutes an invalid restraint on alienation. However, the issue here is about property use, not transfer, so this is irrelevant.  
- **Option B**: Claims the covenant is overly restrictive and unenforceable. Courts typically uphold such covenants unless they violate public policy, and this covenant appears standard for residential areas.  
- **Option C**: Suggests the covenant does not explicitly prohibit converting homes into businesses. However, the covenant clearly prohibits "trade, commerce, or business," which would include a massage parlor.  
- **Option D**: Argues the chef can use his property as he wishes, but valid covenants generally restrict such use, making this argument weak.  
- **Option E**: States that the benefit is in gross, so the burden cannot run. This is a strong argument because the city, as a municipal corporation, is not a landowner in the development. The benefit of the covenant, originally held by the community association (an administrative entity), was assigned to the city, making it a benefit in gross. For a covenant to run with the land, the benefit must be appurtenant to land, which is not the case here.  
- **Option F**: Claims the chef was unaware of the covenant. However, if the covenant was properly recorded, the chef is bound regardless of his knowledge.  
- **Option G**: Argues the assignment to the city was invalid because the association was terminated. The assignment occurred before termination, so this argument fails.  
- **Option H**: Suggests the burden is in gross, but the burden here is tied to the land, not personal, so this is incorrect.  
- **Option I**: Argues the city is not in privity of estate with the association. While true, the enforceability of covenants depends on whether they run with the land, not privity.  

### Conclusion:
The best argument is that the benefit of the covenant is in gross, as it was assigned to the city, a non-landowner. Since the benefit is not appurtenant to land, the burden cannot run with the land, and the city cannot enforce the covenant.
