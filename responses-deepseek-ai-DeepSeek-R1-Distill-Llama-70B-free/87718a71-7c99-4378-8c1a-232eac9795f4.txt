Okay, so I've got this problem about antennas, cables, and noise. Hmm, I need to calculate the noise figure of the system and the overall noise temperature. Alright, let's start by breaking down what each part means.

The problem gives me an antenna lead-in cable with attenuation loss L = 4 and gain G = 0.25. Oh wait, wait. Attenuation loss is usually expressed in decibels, right? So if L is 4 dB, that's the loss. But wait, sometimes attenuation is given as a ratio, like 0.25. Wait, no, the question says L=4, so I think that's 4 dB. But then it says gain G=0.25. Oh, wait, maybe G is the gain of the antenna? Or is G the gain of the lead-in cable? Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

Wait, the problem states: "An antenna lead-in cable with attenuation loss L=4 and gain G=0.25..." So the cable has an attenuation loss of 4 (probably dB) and a gain of 0.25. Wait, that doesn't make sense. How can a cable have a gain? Cables usually have loss, not gain. Oh wait, maybe G is the gain of the antenna, not the cable. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terms. Alternatively, perhaps G is the gain of an amplifier at the end of the cable. Hmm, maybe I should think about this.

Wait, the problem says the cable has attenuation loss L=4 and gain G=0.25. So the cable's loss is 4 dB, and the gain is 0.25, which is less than 1. But that seems confusing because a gain less than 1 would imply loss. Wait, maybe G is the gain after the loss. Hmm, perhaps the cable's loss is 4 dB, so the gain is 1/L where L is the loss in linear terms. So if L is 4 dB, that's a linear loss factor of 10^(4/10) ≈ 10^0.4 ≈ 2.51. So the gain would be 1/2.51 ≈ 0.398, but the given G is 0.25, which is 0.25. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps G is the gain of the receiver's amplifier or something else.

Wait, the problem also mentions a receiver with F = 10 dB noise figure and G = 80 dB gain. Oh, so the receiver has its own noise figure and gain. I think I'm getting tangled here. Let me try to outline the system.

The system probably looks like this: the antenna is connected to a lead-in cable, which connects to the receiver. The lead-in cable has some loss, which affects the noise figure. Then, the receiver has its own noise figure and gain.

Wait, but when calculating the system noise figure, the formula comes into play where each component's noise figure is considered, along with their gains. The overall noise figure is calculated using the Friis formula, which is:

F_total = F1 + (F2 - 1)/G1 + (F3 - 1)/(G1*G2) + ... 

Where F1 is the noise figure of the first component, G1 is the gain of the first component, F2 is the noise figure of the second, and so on.

Wait, but in this case, the first component is the lead-in cable, which has a loss, so its gain is less than 1. So for the lead-in cable, the noise figure F_cable is given by F = 1 + (T_cable / T0) * (1 - 1/G_cable), where T0 is the reference temperature (usually 290 K). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the lead-in cable is at a physical temperature of 290 K, which is the same as the reference temperature. So the noise contributed by the cable would be based on its attenuation.

Alternatively, another approach: the noise figure of a passive component like a cable is given by F = 1 + (L - 1), where L is the loss expressed as a ratio (not in dB). Wait, no, maybe the noise figure for a passive component is F = 1 + (T_physical / T0) * (1 - 1/G), where G is the gain (G = 1/L).

Wait, I think for a passive component, like a lossy cable, the noise figure F can be calculated using F = 1 + (L - 1) if the physical temperature is the same as the reference temperature (T0 = 290 K). Because when T = T0, F = 1 + (L - 1) = L.

Wait, let me think again. The noise figure of a passive device (like a cable) is given by F = 1 + (T_cable / T0) * (1 - 1/G), where G is the gain (G=1/L when L is the loss as a ratio). If T_cable equals T0, then F = 1 + (1) * (1 - 1/G) = 2 - 1/G.

Wait, but if the cable has a loss L (in dB), L is 10 log(G), so G = 10^(L/10). Wait, no, because L (loss in dB) is 10 log(P_loss), where P_loss is the ratio of input power to output power. So P_loss = 10^(L/10). So G, the gain, is 1/P_loss = 10^(-L/10).

Wait, in this problem, the lead-in cable has L=4 dB. So P_loss = 10^(4/10) ≈ 2.5119. So G_cable = 1/2.5119 ≈ 0.398.

Wait, but the problem states that the cable's gain G is 0.25. Hmm, that's conflicting. So either I'm misunderstanding the problem, or perhaps the G given is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the cable's gain is 0.25, which would mean that the loss L is 10 log(1/0.25) = 10 log(4) ≈ 6.02 dB. But the problem says L=4. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps G=0.25 is the gain of an amplifier after the cable. So perhaps the setup is: antenna -> cable (loss L=4 dB) -> amplifier with gain G=0.25, but that doesn't make much sense because an amplifier after a lossy cable would have a gain higher than 1 to compensate. Alternatively, perhaps G=0.25 is the gain of the cable itself, implying a loss of L= -10 log(0.25) ≈ 6 dB. But the problem says L=4, so that's a conflict.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to proceed step by step.

First, the system consists of the antenna, the lead-in cable, and the receiver.

The problem states that the cable has attenuation loss L=4 and gain G=0.25. I think I must have misunderstood the terms. Maybe L is the loss in dB, so L=4 dB, and G is the gain, which is 0.25 (so G=0.25 in linear terms, which corresponds to a loss of L=6.02 dB, as 10 log(1/0.25)=6.02). But the problem says L=4, so perhaps the given G is actually the gain after considering some other factors. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the gain of the antenna as G=0.25, and the cable's loss is L=4 dB. That could make sense. If the antenna has a gain of 0.25 (which is low, as antennas usually have gains higher than 1), but perhaps it's just an example.

Wait, no, the problem says the lead-in cable has L=4 and G=0.25. So the cable's loss is 4 dB, and its gain is 0.25. Wait, that can't be, because loss is the inverse of gain. So if the loss is 4 dB, the gain would be 10^(-4/10) ≈ 0.398. But the problem says G=0.25, which is 0.25. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps G=0.25 is the gain of an amplifier connected to the cable. So the setup is cable (loss L=4 dB) followed by an amplifier with gain G=0.25. But then the overall gain would be cable_gain * amp_gain = 0.398 * 0.25 ≈ 0.0995. That seems very low, but maybe that's the case.

Wait, maybe the problem is structured as the cable has a loss (attenuation) of 4 dB, which is a gain of 1/10^(4/10) ≈ 0.398, and then the receiver has a gain of 80 dB (which is 10^8), and a noise figure F=10 dB.

Wait, but the problem states that the cable's gain is G=0.25, so perhaps that is the case, regardless of the loss. So perhaps the cable's gain is 0.25, which implies that the loss is L = -10 log(0.25) = 6.02 dB. But the problem says L=4, so that's conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the given data. So the cable has a loss L=4 dB (so gain G1 = 10^(-4/10) ≈ 0.398), and then the receiver has a noise figure F2=10 dB and gain G2=80 dB.

Wait, no, the problem says the receiver's gain is 80 dB, which is 10^8 in linear terms. So the system would consist of the cable (gain G1 ≈ 0.398, F1 = ?) followed by the receiver (F2=10 dB, G2=10^8).

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the cable's noise figure. So for a passive component at temperature T, the noise figure F is given by F = 1 + (T / T0) * (1 - 1/G), where G is the gain (G = 1/L, with L being the loss as a ratio). Since the cable is at T = 290 K, same as T0, F_cable = 1 + (1) * (1 - 1/G_cable).

Given that G_cable is 0.398 (from L=4 dB), F_cable = 1 + (1 - 1/0.398) = 1 + (1 - 2.514) = 1 - 1.514 = negative, which can't be right. Wait, that can't be correct. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the correct formula for the noise figure of a passive component is F = 1 + (T / T0) * (1 - 1/G), where G is the gain (G < 1 for lossy components). So with G = 0.398 and T=T0=290 K, F_cable = 1 + 1*(1 - 1/0.398) = 1 + (1 - 2.514) = 1 - 1.514 = -0.514. That can't be right because noise figure can't be negative.

Ah, I must have made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. For a passive device, the noise figure is F = 1 + (L - 1), where L is the loss as a ratio. Since L = 10^(L_dB/10), so L = 10^(4/10) ≈ 2.5119. So F_cable = 1 + (2.5119 - 1) = 2.5119, which is about 4 dB when converted. Wait, F in dB is 10 log(F_linear), so 10 log(2.5119) ≈ 4 dB, which makes sense because the loss is 4 dB.

Wait, so the noise figure of the cable is 4 dB. That makes sense because a lossy cable at the same temperature as the reference will have a noise figure equal to its loss in dB.

So F1 = 4 dB, and G1 = 0.398 (from L=4 dB).

Wait, but the problem says the cable's gain is G=0.25, which would imply a loss of about 6 dB, but the problem states L=4. So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the cable's gain is 0.25, so L is 6 dB, but the problem says L=4. This is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, but I have to proceed with what's given.

Assuming that the cable's loss is L=4 dB, so G1 = 10^(-4/10) ≈ 0.398, and F1 = 4 dB.

Then, the receiver has a noise figure F2=10 dB, and gain G2=80 dB, which is 10^8 in linear terms.

Wait, but the receiver's gain is after the cable, so the system's overall noise figure would be calculated using the Friis formula.

Friis formula for two stages is F_total = F1 + (F2 - 1)/G1 + (F3 - 1)/(G1*G2) + ... 

But in this case, there are two components: the cable and the receiver.

So F_total = F1 + (F2 - 1)/G1.

Wait, but wait, the formula is F_total = F1 + (F2 - 1)/G1.

Because the first stage is the cable with noise figure F1 and gain G1, and the second stage is the receiver with noise figure F2 and gain G2. Since the receiver's gain is much higher, the contribution of the cable's noise might dominate.

Wait, but let's compute it step by step.

F1 is 4 dB, which is 10 log(F1_linear) =4 → F1_linear = 10^(4/10) ≈ 2.5119.

Wait, no. Wait, the noise figure in linear terms is F1_linear = 10^(4/10) ≈ 2.5119.

Wait, no, wait: F (dB) = 10 log(F_linear). So F_linear = 10^(F_dB/10).

So F1_linear = 10^(4/10) ≈ 2.5119.

Similarly, F2 is 10 dB, so F2_linear = 10^(10/10) = 10.

G1 is 0.398 (linear).

So applying the Friis formula:

F_total_linear = F1_linear + (F2_linear - 1)/G1.

Plugging in the numbers:

F_total_linear = 2.5119 + (10 - 1)/0.398.

Compute (9)/0.398 ≈ 22.610.

So F_total_linear ≈ 2.5119 + 22.610 ≈ 25.1219.

Now, convert F_total_linear back to dB:

F_total_dB = 10 log(25.1219) ≈ 10 * 1.4003 ≈ 14.003 dB.

Hmm, that's approximately 14 dB. But looking at the options, the closest is option D:15 dB, or option H:14 dB. Wait, the options are A-J, and looking back, option H is 14 dB, 10,500K. Option D is 15 dB, 11,000K.

Wait, but I calculated approximately 14 dB, which would point towards option H. But let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate:

F1_linear = 10^(4/10) = 10^0.4 ≈ 2.51188643150958.

F2_linear = 10^(10/10)=10.

G1_linear = 10^(-4/10) ≈ 0.3981071705534977.

So, (F2_linear - 1) = 9.

Then, 9 / G1_linear = 9 / 0.3981071705534977 ≈ 22.61.

Adding F1_linear: 2.5118864315 + 22.61 ≈ 25.12188643.

F_total_linear ≈25.12188643.

Convert back to dB: 10 * log10(25.12188643) ≈10 * 1.4003 ≈14.003 dB. So about 14 dB, which would correspond to option H:14 dB, 10,500K.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm using the right approach. The Friis formula is for the system noise figure when each stage is at a certain noise figure and gain. But I'm considering only the cable and the receiver. Wait, perhaps I should include the antenna's noise as well, but the problem doesn't mention the antenna's noise temperature, only the cable's physical temperature. Hmm, the problem says the cable is subjected to a physical temperature of 290K, which is the same as the reference temperature T0. So the antenna's noise is at T0, but the cable's noise is also at T0 because it's at the same temperature. So the system's overall noise temperature would be higher because of the cable loss.

Wait, perhaps part (b) is about the overall noise temperature, which would be T_total = T_antenna + T_cable/(G1) + T_receiver/(G1*G2).

Wait, but since the antenna is at T0 (assuming it's at 290K), and the cable is at T0. But wait, the cable's noise contribution would be T_cable * (1 - 1/G1), because it's passive. Wait, maybe I should approach it from the noise temperature perspective.

The overall system noise temperature T_total can be calculated as:

T_total = T_antenna + T_cable*(1 - 1/G1) + T_receiver/(G1).

Wait, but the antenna's noise temperature is T0=290K, because it's a passive antenna at ambient temperature. The cable's physical temperature is 290K, so T_cable=290K. The receiver's noise temperature would be T_receiver = (F2 - 1)*T0, where F2 is the receiver's noise figure in linear terms.

Wait, F2_linear is 10, so T_receiver = (10 - 1)*290 = 9*290=2610 K.

Hmm, so putting it together:

T_total = T_antenna + T_cable*(1 - 1/G1) + T_receiver/(G1).

Wait, but G1 is the gain of the cable, which is 0.398. So let's compute each term.

T_antenna =290 K.

T_cable*(1 -
