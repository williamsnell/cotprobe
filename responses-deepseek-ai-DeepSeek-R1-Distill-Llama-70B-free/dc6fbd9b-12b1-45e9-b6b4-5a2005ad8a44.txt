Question:

The frequency of the gene for sickle-cell anemia in American Blacks is less than that found in the people living in their ancestral home in Africa. What factors might account for this difference?

Options:

A: The factors include improved healthcare in America that helps manage sickle-cell anemia, the death of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype, and similar rates of interracial marriages in Africa and America.
B: The factors include the introduction of a sickle-cell cure in America, the survival of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype, and the presence of malaria in Africa.
C: The factors include the presence of malaria in both America and Africa, the survival of individuals with the sickle-cell trait, and high levels of interracial marriages in both regions.
D: The factors include selective migration patterns of African people with lower sickle-cell gene frequency to America, the survival advantage of sickle-cell trait carriers in malaria-endemic areas, and the genetic mixing due to interracial marriages in America.
E: The factors include the presence of malaria in Africa, the survival of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype, and lack of interracial marriages in America.
F: The factors include the absence of malaria in America, the death of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype, and interracial marriages in America diluting the sickle-cell genes.
G: The factors include the presence of malaria in America, the survival of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype, and lack of interracial marriages in Africa.
H: The factors include the absence of malaria in both regions, the death of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype in Africa, and the promotion of interracial marriages in America.
I: The factors include the absence of malaria in Africa, the death of individuals with homozygous sickle-cell genotype, and interracial marriages in Africa diluting the sickle-cell genes.
J: The factors include a higher rate of genetic mutations in America, the survival of individuals with the sickle-cell trait, and the absence of interracial marriages in Africa.

Okay, so I've got this question about the frequency of the sickle-cell gene in American Blacks compared to their ancestral home in Africa. Hmm, I remember that sickle-cell anemia is a genetic disorder, and it's more common in areas where malaria is prevalent. Oh wait, because the sickle-cell trait (being a carrier, like heterozygous) offers some protection against malaria. That makes sense because I think natural selection plays a role here.

The question says that the frequency is lower in American Blacks than in Africans. Why could that be? Well, in Africa, where malaria is present, the sickle-cell allele is more common because carriers have a survival advantage. But in America, malaria isn't as prevalent, right? So the selective pressure is different.

Wait, but the question is about the gene frequency. So in Africa, the allele is maintained at a higher frequency because carriers are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on the gene. In America, without the same malaria pressure, maybe the allele isn't as advantageous. But wait, the question is about the frequency being lower in America. So why is that?

I think another factor is the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which states that allele frequencies remain constant unless acted upon by factors like selection, mutation, migration, or genetic drift. So perhaps there's been some gene flow or selection against the allele in America.

Wait, I remember that in the US, the allele frequency is lower because when people migrated from Africa to America, some may not have carried the allele as much. Oh, but maybe it's also because in America, individuals with the homozygous condition (sickle-cell anemia) might not survive as long or reproduce as much. So the recessive allele would be selected against because the disease is harmful.

Another point is interracial marriages. When African Americans marry people from other groups where the sickle-cell allele is less common, their offspring might be less likely to carry the allele. This dilutes the frequency in the gene pool. So in Africa, the population is more homogeneous, so the allele remains higher because of the selective advantage.

So putting it all together, the factors making the frequency lower in America could be:
1. Absence of malaria (so no selective advantage for carriers, and selection against the homozygous condition leads to lower allele frequency).
2. The fact that people with the homozygous genotype (SS) may die younger or have lower reproductive success, reducing the allele frequency.
3. Interracial marriages in America causing a dilution of the allele frequency.

Looking at the options, let me go through them:

Option A: Talks about improved healthcare managing the disease, death of homozygous individuals, and similar marriage rates. Not sure about healthcare's role in the gene frequency directly. Also, if marriage rates are similar, maybe that's not a factor.

Option B: Mentions a cure, which I don't think exists. Also, survival of homozygous individuals, which would increase the allele frequency, but the question says it's lower in America. So this might not fit.

Option C: Presence of malaria in both, which isn't true because the US has less malaria. So this is incorrect.

Option D: Migration patterns. It says people with lower frequency migrated, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Also, survival advantage in Africa because of malaria, which is true, and genetic mixing (interracial marriages) in America. That sounds plausible.

Option E: Presence of malaria in Africa, which is correct, but says survival of homozygous which would mean more alleles. Also, lack of interracial marriages in America doesn't make sense because I think there are more interracial marriages which would dilute the allele.

Option F: Absence of malaria in America, which is correct. Death of homozygous individuals, which would reduce the allele. Interracial marriages, which would dilute the frequency. This sounds right.

Option G: Presence of malaria in America, which isn't correct, so this is out.

Option H: Absence of malaria in both, incorrect because Africa has malaria.

Option I: Absence in Africa, which is wrong. So no.

Option J: Higher mutation rate, which isn't a factor here because the mutation rate for this gene isn't higher in America.

So now between options D, F, and perhaps another. Option D says selective migration of people with lower frequency. I'm not sure about that. What's the migration pattern? During the transatlantic slave trade, people were brought from various regions. But the idea is that in areas with more malaria, the allele is more common. So maybe the people who migrated were from areas with higher or lower allele frequencies? I'm not certain about that point.

Option F says the absence of malaria (so no selection for the allele), death of individuals with SS genotype (so lower allele frequency), and interracial marriages. That makes a lot of sense because without malaria, the heterozygous advantage is gone, and the homozygous individuals don't survive, so the allele decreases. Also, interracial marriages would mean more carriers have children with people without the allele, leading to lower frequency.

Wait, the original question is why the frequency in American Blacks is lower than in their ancestral home. So, in the ancestral home, the allele is maintained at a higher frequency because of the presence of malaria. In the US, without malaria, the allele isn't advantageous, so selection against the SS genotype reduces the frequency. Also, interracial marriages lead to a dilution of the allele in the population.

So looking at option F again: absence of malaria in America, death of homozygous individuals, and interracial marriages. That fits.

So the correct answer is F.

The frequency of the sickle-cell gene is lower in American Blacks compared to their ancestral home in Africa due to several factors. In Africa, the sickle-cell allele is maintained at a higher frequency because heterozygous carriers (sickle-cell trait) have a survival advantage in malaria-endemic regions. However, in America, the absence of malaria removes this selective advantage, and individuals with the homozygous sickle-cell genotype (SS) often face lower survival and reproductive success, leading to a reduction in the allele frequency. Additionally, interracial marriages in America contribute to the dilution of the sickle-cell gene in the population, as offspring of such unions are less likely to inherit the allele. These factors collectively explain the lower frequency of the sickle-cell gene in American Blacks.

Option F correctly identifies these factors: the absence of malaria in America, the death of individuals with the homozygous sickle-cell genotype, and interracial marriages in America diluting the sickle-cell genes.

Answer: F
