Question:

A woman was the fee simple owner of a 20-acre tract of land. When the woman moved to another state, a man took possession of the tract. The man's possession has at all times complied with the requirements of the applicable adverse possession statute in effect. Twelve years after the man took possession, the woman died intestate, leaving her six-year-old son as her only surviving heir. Nine years after the woman's death, when the son was 15, the son's guardian discovered that the man was in possession of the tract. Assume that the statutory period of adverse possession is 20 years and the age of majority is 18. Which of the following correctly describes the state of title to the tract?

Options:

A: The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional seven years, or until the son reaches the age of 25.
B: The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional three years, or until the son reaches the age of 18.
C: The man has acquired title by adverse possession.
D: The man will acquire title by adverse possession only if the son does not claim the land before he turns 18.
E: The man has not acquired title by adverse possession because the woman was not aware of his possession at the time of her death.
F: The man has not acquired title by adverse possession because the son was a minor at the time of the woman's death.
G: The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional eight years, making a total of 12 years after the woman's death.
H: The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12years, or nine years after the son attains the ageof 18.
I: The man will acquire title by adverse possession only if he continues in possession for a total of 30 years.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this adverse possession question. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is about a woman who owns a 20-acre tract of land. She moves to another state, and then a man takes possession. His possession meets all the requirements of the adverse possession statute. The statutory period here is 20 years. Twelve years after the man takes possession, the woman dies intestate, leaving a six-year-old son as her only heir. Then, nine years after her death, when the son is 15, the guardian finds out about the man's possession.

Hmm. So, the key points here are the timelines and the issue of minority affecting the adverse possession period.

First, I need to remember how adverse possession works, especially regarding the statutory period and when it's tolled or paused. Adverse possession requires that the possession be open, hostile, continuous, and actual for the statutory period. But when the true owner is a minor, the period is often tolled until the minor reaches majority.

In this case, the woman dies, and her son is six years old. So the son is the new owner. But because he's a minor, the statute of limitations (here, the adverse possession period) is tolled until he turns 18. That means during the time the son is a minor, the man's possession doesn't count towards the 20-year requirement.

Let's map out the timeline:

- Woman moves away, man takes possession. Let's call this year 0.

- For the next 12 years, the man is in possession. So up to year 12, the woman dies. At that point, the man has been there for 12 years.

After the woman's death, the son becomes the owner at age 6. The man continues in possession. But because the son is a minor, the 20-year clock stops until the son turns 18.

So from the time the woman dies (year 12) until the son turns 18 (year 12 + 12 = year 24?), no time counts towards the adverse possession period. Wait, wait. Wait, the son is 6 when the woman dies, so he turns 18 at year 12 + 12 = 24? Wait, no, the son's age at the woman's death is 6, so 12 years later (when the guardian discovers), the son is 15. Hmm, I think I got that wrong.

Wait, the woman dies 12 years after the man took possession. So at her death, the son is 6. Then, nine years later, the son is 15. So from the time of the woman's death to when the guardian finds out is nine years. That would make the son 6 + 9 = 15. So the time between the woman's death and discovery is nine years.

So, the man has been in possession for 12 years before the woman's death, and then continues for another nine years until discovery. But during those nine years, the son is a minor (from 6 to 15), so the statute is tolled.

So the man's total adverse possession time is 12 years (before the woman's death) plus whatever time counts after the son reaches majority.

Wait, but the son hasn't reached majority yet. He's 15 when the guardian finds out. So majority is 18, so he's three years short. So the man hasn't completed the 20 years yet. But let's see.

The statutory period is 20 years. The man has 12 years before the son inherits. But when the woman dies, the son is 6, so the statute is tolled until he turns 18.

So the man's possession from year 12 to year 24 (when the son turns 18) doesn't count. So during those 12 years, nothing adds to the 20-year requirement.

Wait, no. Wait, the son was 6 when the woman died (year 12), so he turns 18 at year 12 + 12 = 24. So from year 12 to 24, the son is a minor, so the adverse possession period is tolled.

So the man has 12 years before the woman's death, and then from year 24 (son turns 18) onward, any possession counts again.

Wait, but the question is about the state of title when the guardian discovers the possession. That's nine years after the woman's death, which is year 21 (12 +9=21). At that point, the son is 15, so still a minor. So the man has only accumulated 12 years (before the woman died) towards the 20-year requirement.

So the man needs 8 more years after the son turns 18. Because 12 (before) + 8 (after) = 20.

Wait, but the son's minority ends at 18. So the man can continue for 8 more years after the son turns 18 to reach the 20-year requirement.

Alternatively, the man could wait until the son turns 18, and then continue for the remaining time. Let me think in terms of the options provided.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the man must continue for an additional 3 years, or until the son is 18. Wait, why 3 years? The man already has 12 years, so he needs 8 more. But if the son is currently 15, he'll be 18 in 3 years. So if the man continues until the son is 18, that's 3 more years, but then he'd have 15 years total, which is still less than 20. Hmm, maybe that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me try again.

The statutory period is 20 years. The man has 12 years before the woman dies. At that point, the woman dies, the son is 6. The man continues in possession, but from year 12 onward, the son is a minor, so the time doesn't count. So when the son reaches 18 (at year 24), the man can start counting again.

So the man's total time would be 12 (before) + any time after the son turns 18. So he needs 8 more years after the son is 18. So if the man continues for 8 more years after the son turns 18, that's 20 years in total.

Alternatively, the man could wait until the son turns 18, and then for 8 years, making the total 20.

So the man hasn't acquired title yet because he's only got 12 years, and he needs 8 more after the son is 18.

Looking at the options:

Option B says he needs 3 more years or until the son is 18. But 12+3=15, which is less than 20.

Option H says he needs 12 more years, or nine after the son is 18. Let me see. Wait, the son is 15 now. He'll be 18 in 3 years. So if the man continues for 3 years until the son is 18, that's 3 years, but the man would then have 15 years total. He needs 20, so he still needs 5 more years after that.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's map it out.

Total needed: 20 years.

Time before woman's death: 12 years.

From woman's death (year 12) to when son turns 18 (year 24) is 12 years, but during that time, the son is a minor, so no time counts towards the 20 years.

So after year 24, any time the man stays counts. So he needs 20 -12=8 more years after the son turns 18.

So the man must continue for 8 more years after the son is 18. Or, the son could turn 18 in 3 years, so the man could wait 3 years for the son to turn 18, and then 8 more years.

Wait, no, the son is 15 now. So 3 years until he's 18. So if the man continues in possession until the son is 18 (3 more years), that's 15 years total (12 before +3 during minority, but those 3 don't count). So he still needs 8 years after the son is 18.

So the man can't get title until 8 years after the son turns 18. So that's 3 years (until 18) plus 8 years, totaling 11 more years.

Wait, but looking at the options, none seem to exactly match that. Let me check the options again.

Option B: The man must continue for an additional 3 years, or until the son is 18. So that would give 15 total, which isn't enough.

Option H: The man must continue for an additional 12 years, or nine years after the son turns 18. Wait, 12 years after the woman's death is 24, which is when the son is 18. So 12 years after the woman's death would be 24, but the man has already been in possession for 12 years before that. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, the problem says the man took possession, and twelve years later, the woman dies. So from possession (year 0) to her death (year 12), that's 12 years. Then, nine years after her death (year 21), the guardian finds out. So at year 21, the son is 15.

So the man has 12 years before the woman dies. Then, from year 12 to 21: nine years, but during those nine years, the son is a minor (ages 6 to 15), so the time doesn't count.

So the man's total adverse possession time is 12 years. He needs 20, so he needs 8 more years after the son is no longer a minor.

So the son turns 18 at year 24 (12 +12). So from year 24 onward, each year counts. So he needs 8 more years from year 24, which would take us to year 32.

But the options don't have 8 years. Let me check the options again.

Option H says: The man will not acquire title unless he continues in adverse possession for an additional 12 years, or nine years after the son attains 18.

Wait, nine years after the son is 18 would be when the son is 27 (18+9=27). But why nine years?

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is based on the time since the woman's death. The woman died 12 years after the man took possession. The man has been in possession for 12 years before her death. Then, the son is a minor for 12 years (until 18). So from the woman's death, the man would need to wait until the son is 18, which is 12 years. Then, he needs the remaining 8 years.

Wait, but the man has already been in possession for 12 years before the woman died. So the remaining time is 20 -12=8 years, but those 8 have to be after the son is 18.

So the man needs to possess for 8 more years after the son is 18. So that could be an option. Let's see which option matches that.

Looking at option H: additional 12 years, or nine years after the son is 18. Hmm, no. Because 8 years is needed.

Option B: 3 more years, until the son is 18. No, because that only gives 15 total, which isn't enough.

Option G: additional 8 years, making total 12 after woman's death. Wait, 12 after woman's death would be 24, but the son is 18 at 24, so that would be 12 years after the woman's death, which would include the time when the son was a minor. So that doesn't count.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. The total time the man has is 12 years. He needs 20. So 8 more years are needed, but those have to be after the son is 18.

So the man could wait until the son turns 18, which is in 3 years (son is 15 now), and then possess for 8 more years. That would make the total time 12 +8=20 years.

So the man needs to continue for 3 years (until the son is 18) plus 8 years, totaling 11 more years.

But looking at the options, none seem to fit exactly. Let me review the options again.

Option B: Continue for 3 more years or until son is 18. But that would only give 15 years, which isn't enough.

Option H: Additional 12 years or nine after son is 18. Wait, 12 years after the woman's death would be 24, which is when the son is 18. So, if the man continues for 12 more years after the woman's death (total 24 from the start), that would be 12 +12=24, but during the 12 after her death, the son was a minor, so only the last 0 years (since he turns 18 at 24) would count. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the point at which the guardian discovered. At that point, the man has 12 years, and the son is 15. So the man hasn't completed the 20 years yet. So the title hasn't passed yet.

Now, the options are about the current state of title. So, the man hasn't acquired title yet because he hasn't met the 20-year requirement.

So which options say that? Let's see.

Option C says the man has acquired title. That's incorrect because he only has 12 years.

Option F says the man hasn't acquired title because the son was a minor at the woman's death. Well, the reason is more about the tolling of the statute during minority.

Option B says he needs to continue for 3 more years or until the son is 18. But even if he does that, he only has 15 years. So he can't acquire title yet.

Option H says he needs 12 more years after the woman's death, which is when the son is 18. Wait, the woman's death was at year 12, so 12 more years would be year 24. At that point, the son is 18. But the man has already been in possession for 12 years before that, so total would be 24 years, but 12 of those were after the woman's death, but only the time after the son turns 18 would count.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try another approach.

The rule is that when a minor inherits, the adverse possession time is tolled until the minor reaches majority. So any time the man spends in possession while the son is a minor doesn't count towards the 20 years.

So the man had 12 years before the son became the owner. Then, the son is a minor for 12 years (from 6 to 18). So during those 12 years, the man's possession doesn't count. So after the son turns 18, the man can start counting again.

So the man needs 20 years in total. He has 12 before the woman's death. After the son turns 18, he needs 8 more years to reach 20.

So the man needs to stay for 8 more years after the son is 18.

So, the son is currently 15. He'll be 18 in 3 years. So the man can wait 3 years (until the son is 18) and then 8 more years. So that's 11 more years.

But the options don't have 8 years. Let me look again.

Option H says the man must continue for an additional 12 years, or nine years after the son is 18. If he continues for nine years after the son is 18, that's 9 years, which added to his 12 would make 21, which exceeds 20. So that would work.

Wait, but why nine? Because the statutory period is 20, and he had 12 before, so he needs 8 after. So nine would be more than enough, but perhaps the option is considering that from the time the guardian finds out (year 21), the man needs to continue until the son is 18 (3 years) and then 8 more, totaling 11 years. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the time after the son's majority is 20 -12 =8 years.

So the correct answer would be that the man hasn't acquired title yet and needs 8 more years after the son is 18. But looking at the options, none directly state that.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option B: Continue for 3 more years, or until the son is 18. But that gives 15 years, which is insufficient.

Option H: Continue for 12 more years, or nine after son is 18. So 12 years from now (which is year 21) would be 33, but the man has 12 already, so that's 12+12=24, but the son's time as a minor complicates this. Alternatively, nine years after the son is 18 (year 24 +9=33). So in 33, the man has been in possession for 12 (before) +9 (after) =21 years, which exceeds 20.

But the man only needs 8 years after the son is 18 to reach 20.

So perhaps the correct answer is that the man hasn't acquired title and needs to continue for 8 more years after the son is 18. But none of the options exactly say that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps option H is correct because it allows for the time after the son is 18.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about when the man's 20 years would be completed.

He has 12 years before the woman's death. Then, the son is a minor for 12 years (until 18). So from the woman's death (year 12) to the son's 18th birthday (year 24), the man's possession doesn't count. So he needs to stay from year 24 onwards. He needs 8 more years (20-12=8). So he can acquire title in year 24+8=32.

So the man must continue until year 32, which is 8 years after the son is 18.

Looking at the options, option H says the man must continue for an additional 12 years, or nine years after the son is 18. Well, nine years after the son is 18 would be more than enough (9>8). So if the man continues until nine years after the son is 18, that's sufficient. Alternatively, continuing for 12 more years from now (year 21) would be year 33, which is also beyond the needed 8 years.

Wait, but the question is about the current state of title. The man hasn't completed the 20 years yet because the son's minority tolled
