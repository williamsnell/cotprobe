Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what "eyeballing" means as a technique. The question gives me ten options, from A to J. Let me go through each one and see which makes the most sense.

First, I know that "eyeballing" is a colloquial term, so it's probably something to do with using your eyes or visual estimation. Let me think about each option:

A: Estimating measurements by sight without using tools. That sounds familiar. Like when someone guesses the size of something just by looking, not using a ruler or tape measure.

B: Keeping eyes on participants at all times. Hmm, that sounds more like a method for observing behavior in studies, maybe in psychology. Not sure if that's called eyeballing though.

C: Reading a document quickly to get the gist. I think that's called skimming, not eyeballing.

D: Observing closely to identify details. That could be it, but isn't that more like just observing or being observant? Not sure.

E: Visually inspecting a site for safety. That's more like a safety inspection, maybe not specifically called eyeballing.

F: Looking at a problem and guessing based on experience. That sounds like using experience to make an educated guess, which might be part of it, but is that what eyeballing refers to?

G: Gathering samples from people in public. That doesn't seem right. Eyeballing doesn't relate to sampling methods like that.

H: Quickly reading a paper for main arguments. Again, that's skimming, not sure about eyeballing.

I: Looking at a situation to identify risks. That's more like a risk assessment, not sure.

J: Scanning a table for patterns. That might be part of data analysis, but is that called eyeballing?

Wait, I've heard the term "eyeballing the data" before, which means looking at data to get a general sense without precise measurements. So maybe option A or J.

Option A is about estimating measurements without tools, which fits with the idea of visually approximating. For example, a carpenter might eyeball a measurement instead of using a tape measure.

Option J is about scanning tables for patterns, which is more about data analysis. So which is more likely the general meaning?

I think the broader meaning is A. Because when you eyeball something, you're estimating or judging by sight without precise tools. It's a rough estimate. So the answer should be A.

The term "eyeballing" refers to estimating measurements by sight without using tools, which is a common technique for making rough approximations visually. 

Answer: A
