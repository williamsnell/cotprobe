Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let me read it carefully.

The situation is that a husband and his passenger were killed in a car accident. The defendant is involved. The wife is suing to recover damages for loss of society and companionship. She testified that they had a close relationship and were happily married for over 15 years. Then on cross-examination, the defense attorney asked if she knew about her husband's affair with the passenger. Her attorney objected, and we need to determine if the judge should overrule or sustain the objection.

The options are A through G, each giving a different reason.

First, I need to recall the rules of evidence, especially regarding relevance and what's admissible in cross-examination.

So, the wife is suing for loss of society and companionship, which is a type of non-economic damage. The defense is asking about an affair. The question is whether this line of inquiry is proper.

I remember that in some jurisdictions, evidence of a spouse's infidelity might be relevant to the value of the loss of companionship. If the wife knew about the affair, it could affect how the jury assesses the strength of their relationship. But wait, does that make the question relevant?

Alternatively, such a question might be considered improper because it's trying to smear the deceased's character, which isn't relevant to the case unless it directly affects the damages.

But wait, in a wrongful death case, the plaintiff's damages are based on their loss. If the deceased was having an affair, maybe that shows the marriage wasn't as strong as the wife claimed. So the defendant might argue that her loss isn't as significant because the relationship was troubled.

However, I think that under the rules of evidence, specific instances of conduct can be used on cross-examination to attack a witness's credibility, but only if they're relevant. Here, the question is about whether the wife knew about the affair. Does that relate to her credibility?

Wait, but the wife's testimony was about their close relationship. If the defense can show that the relationship wasn't as strong, that would undercut her testimony. So the question might be relevant to the issue of the strength of their relationship, which affects the damages.

But another angle is that the affair itself, without more, might not be directly relevant. Unless it's being offered to show that the husband was negligent or something, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. Alternatively, if the affair is being used to suggest that the wife's loss isn't as great, then it's about the damages calculation.

So, is evidence of the husband's affair admissible to challenge the wife's claim about their close relationship? I think it could be relevant because it goes to the nature of their marriage, which she testified about. If they were having an affair, maybe their relationship wasn't as close, which would impact the damages.

However, there's also the issue of privacy and whether such questions are unduly prejudicial. But the question is whether the evidence is relevant. If it's relevant, then it's admissible unless its probative value is substantially outweighed by prejudice, which is under Rule 403. But the options don't all address that.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's objectionable because irrelevant. But if it's about the relationship, maybe it's relevant.

Option B says it's objectionable because it tarnishes the deceased's reputation. But the question is about the wife's knowledge, not the husband's character per se. So maybe B isn't the best.

Option C says it's objectionable because it's highly prejudicial. But again, relevance is the key. If it's relevant, it's admissible unless 403 applies, but the option doesn't mention that balance.

Option D says it's not objectionable because the plaintiff's knowledge is probative of the value of her loss. That makes sense because if she knew, maybe their relationship was strained, affecting the loss.

Option E says it's beyond the scope of direct. On cross, you can ask about topics related to direct. She testified about their relationship, so this is related.

Option F says it's objectionable because it infringes on the deceased's privacy. Privacy isn't a rule of evidence per se, but maybe under some privilege? Not sure.

Option G says it's unobjectionable because it provides a motive. I don't see how the affair gives a motive for the accident. Unless maybe the defendant was involved, but that's not clear here.

Wait, the question is about whether the wife knew about the affair. So, if she didn't know, maybe the affair still existed, which could imply that the husband's attention was elsewhere, affecting his driving? That seems a stretch, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's about the passenger being his lover, so perhaps the accident was due to reckless driving because of that. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, if the affair is relevant to the damages, then D might be correct. The value of the loss is tied to the strength of the relationship. So if the wife claims a close relationship, evidence that the husband was having an affair (and perhaps she knew) could contradict that, thus making the loss less.

But wait, if the wife didn't know about the affair, then her testimony about their close relationship would still stand. So the question is whether she knew. If she did, maybe it shows the relationship wasn't as close. If she didn't, then perhaps the affair is irrelevant unless it's about the husband's character affecting something else.

But since the question is about her knowledge, it's about her credibility and the strength of the relationship as she perceived it. So the defense could argue that if she knew, their relationship wasn't as strong, reducing her damages.

Therefore, the question is relevant because it pertains to the value of her loss. So the objection should be overruled, making the question unobjectionable.

Looking at the options, D says it's unobjectionable because plaintiff's knowledge is probative of the loss's value. That seems correct.

But wait, another thought: is the affair itself relevant, or is it the wife's knowledge? If the wife didn't know, does the affair still affect the relationship's strength? Maybe, but the question is about her knowledge. So maybe the defense is trying to show that she's lying about their close relationship by implying she knew about the affair, which would mean the relationship wasn't close.

Alternatively, if she didn't know, then the affair's existence might not be directly relevant unless it's about the husband's character, which might not be admissible.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In a case where a plaintiff is claiming loss of companionship, the defendant can challenge the strength of the relationship. Evidence that the deceased was having an affair could be relevant to show that the relationship wasn't as strong as the plaintiff claims, thus reducing damages.

But the question is whether the plaintiff knew about it. If she did, it might suggest the relationship was troubled. If she didn't, then perhaps the affair doesn't directly impact her loss, but the fact that it was happening might.

Wait, but the question is on cross-examination. The wife testified about their close relationship. The defense can ask about any facts that would contradict that. So even if she didn't know about the affair, the affair's existence might still be relevant to show that the relationship wasn't as strong. But the question is phrased as whether she was aware. So maybe the defense is trying to show that she's lying or that she knew, which would mean the relationship was troubled.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is beyond the scope. On direct, she testified about their relationship, so cross can delve into that.

So, putting it together, the question is relevant because it bears on the closeness of the relationship, which affects damages. Therefore, the objection should be overruled, making the question unobjectionable. So the answer would be D.

But wait, another angle: the affair might be considered a specific instance of the husband's conduct. Under FRE 405, when attacking a witness's character, you can't use specific instances unless it's about the witness's character. But here, the wife is testifying about their relationship, not about the husband's character for honesty or something else. So maybe the defense can't bring it up. Or perhaps it's allowed because it's about the relationship, not the husband's character per se.

Alternatively, maybe the question is improper because it's an attempt to introduce extrinsic evidence of a specific instance of conduct to attack the husband's character, which isn't allowed under FRE 405.

Wait, but the husband isn't testifying; the wife is. So perhaps the defense is trying to attack her credibility by suggesting she's lying about their relationship. But I think that's not the right approach. Her testimony is about their relationship, so the defense can challenge that with relevant evidence.

I think the key point is relevance. If the question is relevant to the value of the loss, then it's admissible. So the answer should be D: unobjectionable because plaintiff's knowledge is probative of the loss's value.

The question revolves around whether the defendant's counsel can ask the wife if she knew about her husband's alleged affair with the passenger, given that she is suing for loss of society and companionship. The wife testified about their close and happy marriage, and the defense seeks to challenge the strength of their relationship, which directly impacts the damages calculation.

Under the rules of evidence, relevance is the key factor. The wife's testimony about their close relationship opens the door for the defense to question the accuracy of her portrayal. If the wife knew about the affair, it could suggest that the relationship was not as strong as she claimed, thereby reducing the value of her loss. Even if she did not know, the existence of the affair might still be relevant to the relationship's quality. However, the question specifically asks about her knowledge, which is probative of whether the relationship was troubled, as her knowledge would imply awareness of marital issues.

While concerns about privacy or prejudice might arise, the question appears to be within the bounds of relevance, as it pertains to the value of the loss of companionship. The defense has the right to challenge the wife's testimony on cross-examination, especially since she testified about the closeness of their relationship. Therefore, the question is not objectionable because it is relevant to the case at hand.
