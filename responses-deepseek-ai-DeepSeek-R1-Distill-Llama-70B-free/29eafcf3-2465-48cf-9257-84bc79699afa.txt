Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the maturity date of a note. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the question says that Mr. Carson signed a note on March 15, and the term is two months. I need to find out when the maturity date is. The options are from A to J, so I'll have to figure it out correctly.

First, I remember that when calculating the end of a term, you have to add the months to the start date. So if it's two months, I just add two months to March 15. Let's see, March has 31 days. So adding one month would bring me to April 15, right? Because March 15 plus one month is April 15. Then adding another month, that would be May 15. So the maturity date should be May 15. 

Wait, but I should double-check. Sometimes when dealing with dates, especially when a term ends on the last day of the month, you have to make sure you're accounting for the correct number of days. But in this case, since it's exactly two months, it's straightforward. March to April is one month, April to May is the second. So March 15 plus two months is May 15.

Looking at the options, option B is May 15. So that must be the correct answer. 

I don't think I'm missing anything here. The note's term is two months, starting from March 15, so adding two months brings it to May 15. Yeah, that makes sense.

The note was signed on March 15 with a two-month term. Adding two months to March 15 results in May 15 as the maturity date.
