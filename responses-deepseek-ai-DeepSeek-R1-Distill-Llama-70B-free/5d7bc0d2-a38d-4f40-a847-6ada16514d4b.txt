Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused about it. Let me try to think it through step by step. 

The question says: A tube of water is moving at half the speed of light relative to the lab frame. Then a beam of light is going in the same direction as the tube and enters the water. We need to find the speed of the light in the water relative to the lab frame. The index of refraction of water is given as 4/3.

Hmm, right. So I remember that the index of refraction, n, is related to the speed of light in a medium. The formula is c = n * v, where v is the speed of light in the medium. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that straight. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. So, for water, n is 4/3, so the speed of light in water would be c divided by (4/3), which is (3/4)c. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the water, right?

But here, the water is moving. Oh, because the tube is moving at 1/2 c relative to the lab. So this must be a problem involving special relativity, perhaps using the velocity addition formula. Because when you're dealing with speeds in different frames, you can't just add them naively; you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, the problem is about the speed of light in the water relative to the lab. So the light is moving through the water, which is itself moving at 1/2 c relative to the lab. So I need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame.

So let's break it down. In the rest frame of the water (let's call it the water frame), the speed of light is v_water = c/n = (3/4)c. Because n is 4/3, so 1/n is 3/4. But wait, the light is moving in the same direction as the water's movement. So in the water's frame, the light is moving at 3/4 c. But how does that look in the lab frame?

Wait, no, wait a second. The light is traveling in the same direction as the tube. So in the lab frame, the tube is moving at 1/2 c. The light enters the tube, so in the tube's frame, the light is moving slower, but from the lab's perspective, what's its speed?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the velocity addition formula. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), where u is the velocity in the lab frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame (the tube), and u' is the velocity in the moving frame. Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me get that straight.

Wait, no. The velocity addition formula is used to find the velocity of an object in one frame when you know its velocity in another frame. So if in the lab frame, the water is moving at v = 1/2 c. Then the light's speed in the water's frame is u' = 3/4 c, because in the water's frame, the light is moving at 3/4 c in the same direction as the tube's movement.

Wait, but the light is moving in the same direction as the tube in the lab frame. So in the water's frame, the light is moving at 3/4 c. So to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, we need to apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, no—wait. Let me clarify. The lab sees the water moving at v = 1/2 c. Inside the water, the light is moving at u' = 3/4 c in the same direction. So the lab frame would see the light's speed as u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' * v)/c² )

Is that correct? Because the formula is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)) )

So substituting the values: u' is 3/4 c, v is 1/2 c.

So u = ( (3/4 c) + (1/2 c) ) / ( 1 + ( (3/4 c)(1/2 c) ) / c² )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 3/4 c + 1/2 c = (3/4 + 2/4) c = 5/4 c.

Denominator: 1 + ( (3/4)(1/2) c² ) / c² ) → 1 + (3/8 c²) / c² → 1 + 3/8 = 11/8.

So u = (5/4 c) / (11/8) ) = (5/4) * (8/11) c = (5 * 2) / 11 c = 10/11 c.

So the speed of light in the water relative to the lab is 10/11 c. So looking at the options, option H is 10/11 c.

Wait, but wait another moment. Oh wait, wait. Because in the water's frame, the speed of light is actually c, but that's only when it's in a medium. Or wait, no—wait. No, no, no. I think I might be making a mistake here.

Wait, no, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. So if the medium is at rest, the light moves at v = c/n. But when the medium itself is moving, then the light's speed in the lab frame isn't simply additive. So perhaps the approach I took is correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: the lab frame sees the water moving at 0.5c, and the light moving through it. The speed of light in the water is c/n = (3/4)c in the water's frame.

So using the velocity addition formula, the lab will see it as u = (v + u')/(1 + vu'/c² )

Which is (0.5c + 0.75c)/(1 + (0.5 *0.75)) → (1.25 c) / (1 + 0.375) → 1.25 c / 1.375 → (5/4 c) / (11/8) ) → (5/4 *8/11) c → 10/11 c.

So that seems correct. So the answer should be H.

To determine the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame, we start by noting that the index of refraction of water is \( n = \frac{4}{3} \). The speed of light in water, in the rest frame of the water, is given by:

\[
v_{\text{water}} = \frac{c}{n} = \frac{c}{\frac{4}{3}} = \frac{3}{4}c.
\]

However, the water is moving at \( v = \frac{1}{2}c \) relative to the lab frame, and the light is traveling in the same direction as the water's motion. To find the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u'v}{c^2}},
\]

where \( u' = \frac{3}{4}c \) is the speed of light in the water's rest frame, and \( v = \frac{1}{2}c \) is the speed of the water relative to the lab frame. Substituting these values:

1. **Numerator**:  
   \[
   u' + v = \frac{3}{4}c + \frac{1}{2}c = \frac{3}{4}c + \frac{2}{4}c = \frac{5}{4}c.
   \]

2. **Denominator**:  
   \[
   1 + \frac{u'v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{\left(\frac{3}{4}c\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}c\right)}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{\frac{3}{8}c^2}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{3}{8} = \frac{11}{8}.
   \]

3. **Speed of light in the lab frame**:  
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{5}{4}c}{\frac{11}{8}} = \frac{5}{4}c \cdot \frac{8}{11} = \frac{10}{11}c.
   \]

Thus, the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame is \( \frac{10}{11}c \). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: \( \frac{10}{11}c \).**
