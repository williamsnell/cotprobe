Okay, so I have this physics problem about Newton's rings. Hmm, I remember that Newton's rings are these circular interference patterns that appear when light reflects off two closely spaced surfaces, like a convex lens and a glass plate. They can be seen in reflected or transmitted light, and in this case, it's transmitted light.

The problem says the wavelength of the light is 500 nm. The diameter of the 20th bright ring is 4 mm. And the questions are a) finding the radius of curvature of the lens, and b) the diameter of the 30th bright ring.

Wait, I think the formula for the radius of the nth bright ring in Newton's rings is important here. I recall that for bright rings, the condition is 2t = (n + 1/2)λ, where t is the thickness of the air film. But wait, the rings are formed due to the path difference. Oh right, and since the lens is convex, the radius of each ring is related to the lens's radius of curvature.

The formula for the radius r of the nth bright ring is given by r² = (2n + 1) R λ, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh, no, the correct formula is r² = (2n) R λ, but wait, maybe I should get this right.

Wait, the formula for the radius of the nth dark ring is r² = 2n R λ. For bright rings, I think it's r² = (2n + 1) R λ. Because bright fringes occur when the path difference is (2n+1)λ/2, leading to constructive interference.

Wait, no, I might have it backwards. Let me double-check. So, in Newton's rings, the dark rings are due to destructive interference. The condition for dark is 2t = nλ. And since t is r²/(2R), substituting gives r² = n λ (2R), so r² = 2nRλ. So for dark rings, r² = 2n R λ.

But wait, the problem says it's the bright rings. So for bright rings, the condition is 2t = (n + 1/2)λ. So substituting t = r²/(2R), we get 2*(r²/(2R)) ) = (n + 1/2) λ → r²/R = (n + 1/2) λ → r² = R (n + 1/2) λ.

So for the nth bright ring, r² = R λ (n + 1/2).

But wait, sometimes I've seen the formula written as r² = (m) R λ, where m is 2n for dark rings and 2n+1 for bright. Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Alternatively, another approach: The radius of the nth bright ring is given by r = sqrt( (2n + 1) R λ ). Because for each bright ring, the order is n, and the formula involves 2n+1.

Wait, let me think. The formula I found in my notes: For bright rings, r² = (2n + 1) R λ. So yes, that's correct.

So, given that, we can proceed.

Given:

For the 20th bright ring, diameter is 4 mm. So radius is 2 mm, which is 2e-3 m, or 2 mm = 0.002 m.

Wait, diameter is 4 mm, so radius r = 2 mm = 2e-3 m.

n=20.

λ=500 nm = 500e-9 m.

We can plug into the formula r² = (2n +1) R λ.

So, (0.002 m)^2 = (2*20 +1) * R * 500e-9 m.

Calculate left side: (0.002)^2 = 4e-6 m².

Right side: (41) R * 500e-9 = 41 * 500e-9 * R = 20500e-9 R = 2.05e-5 R.

So, 4e-6 = 2.05e-5 R → R = (4e-6) / (2.05e-5) → Let's compute that.

4e-6 / 2.05e-5 = (4 / 2.05) * 1e-1 → Approximately 1.9512 * 0.1 → Approximately 0.19512 meters.

Wait, 0.19512 meters is 19.512 cm. Hmm, but wait, the possible options are around 30, 35, 39, etc. cm. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Left side: (2e-3 m)^2 = 4e-6 m².

Right side: (2*20 +1) = 41. 41 * R * 500e-9 m.

So, 41 * 500e-9 = 41 * 5e-7 → 205e-7 → 2.05e-5.

So 4e-6 = 2.05e-5 R → R = 4e-6 / 2.05e-5.

Compute numerator and denominator:

4e-6 = 0.000004

2.05e-5 = 0.0000205.

So 0.000004 / 0.0000205 = 4 / 20.5 ≈ 0.1951 meters → 19.51 cm.

Wait, that's about 19.5 cm, but none of the options for part a) match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Because some sources might use 2n for bright rings.

Wait, another possible formula is for bright rings: r^2 = (2n) R λ. Because some sources say that the first bright ring corresponds to n=0. Let me think.

Wait, when n=0 (the center), r^2 = (2*0 +1) R λ → r^2 = R λ → the center is a bright spot. But sometimes the center is dark if the lens is in contact with the glass plate. Wait, no, in Newton's rings, when the lens and glass are in contact, the center is dark because the path difference is zero (for reflected light, but in transmitted it's different? Or maybe it's the same? Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, the setup here is transmitted light, so perhaps the center is bright. Because in reflected light, the phase change upon reflection causes the center to be dark. But in transmitted light, no phase change, so the center is bright. So in that case, the first bright ring is n=0, with radius given by r^2 = R λ (2*0 +1) → r^2 = R λ.

Wait, but the problem says the 20th bright ring. So if n counts from 0, then the 20th ring corresponds to n=19, or n=20? Wait, no, the nth ring usually starts counting from n=0 as the first ring beyond the center.

Wait, perhaps the formula is r² = (2n +1) R λ, where n is the bright ring number. So for the 20th bright ring, n=20.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave R≈19.5 cm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the correct formula is r² = 2n R λ for dark rings, and for bright rings, it's r² = (2n +1) R λ.

Wait, perhaps the initial mistake was in the formula. Let me try another approach.

Alternative approach:

The formula for the radius of the nth bright ring is r = sqrt( (2n+1) * R * λ )

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the diameter instead of the radius. Because the given is diameter, perhaps it's easier to use diameter squared.

Wait, the diameter D is 2r, so D² = 4r² = 4(2n+1) R λ → D² = 4(2n +1) R λ.

Wait, for the 20th bright ring, D is 4 mm. So D² = (4e-3 m)^2 = 16e-6 m².

So, 16e-6 = 4*(2*20 +1) R * 500e-9.

Compute 2*20 +1 =41. So 4*41=164.

So, 16e-6 = 164 R *500e-9.

Compute 164 *500e-9 = 82e-6.

So, 16e-6 = R *82e-6 → R = 16e-6 / 82e-6 → 16/82 = 8/41 ≈ 0.1951 m → 19.51 cm.

Again, same result. But the options don't have 19.5 cm. So perhaps the formula is different.

Alternative approach: Maybe the formula is r² = (n) R λ, but I thought that was for dark rings. Wait, perhaps for bright rings, r² = (2n) R λ.

Wait, let's try that. So for the 20th bright ring, n=20.

So, r² = 2*20*R*λ → 40 R λ.

r is 2 mm = 0.002 m.

So, (0.002)^2 = 40 R *500e-9.

4e-6 = 40 R *500e-9.

40 *500e-9 = 2e-5.

So, 4e-6 = 2e-5 R → R = 4e-6 / 2e-5 → 0.2 m → 20 cm.

Hmm, 20 cm is not in the options either. Wait, but perhaps the formula is r squared equals (2n) R lambda for dark rings and (2n+1) for bright. So perhaps in the problem, the 20th bright ring corresponds to n=20, but maybe the formula uses (2n +1) as before.

Wait, but the calculation gave R≈19.5 cm, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Another possible formula is r^2 = (m) R λ, where m=2n for dark rings and m=2n+1 for bright rings. So for the 20th bright ring, m=41, so r^2 =41 R λ.

Wait, that's the same as the first approach, giving R≈19.5 cm.

Wait, perhaps the given diameter is for the 20th dark ring, but the problem states it's a bright ring. So perhaps the formula is correct, but the options are incorrect? Or perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Given D =4 mm → r=2 mm = 0.002 m.

So r^2 = (0.002)^2 =4e-6 m².

r^2 = (2n +1) R λ → 4e-6 = (2*20 +1)* R *500e-9.

So (41) R *500e-9 =4e-6 → 41 *500e-9 = 2.05e-5 → 4e-6 = 2.05e-5 R → R =4e-6 /2.05e-5 ≈ (4/2.05) *1e-1 → ≈ 1.9512 * 0.1 → 0.19512 m → 19.512 cm.

Which is approximately 19.5 cm. But none of the options are close. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe it's the dark ring formula.

Let me try the dark ring formula.

For the nth dark ring, r^2 = 2n R λ.

So, if the 20th dark ring has diameter D=4 mm, radius r=2e-3 m.

r^2 = 4e-6 = 2*20 R *500e-9 → 40 R *500e-9 = 4e-6 → 2e-5 R =4e-6 → R= (4e-6)/(2e-5)= 0.2 m → 20 cm.

Still not matching the options. Hmm, perhaps the formula uses the diameter squared instead of radius.

Wait, another possible approach: The formula for the diameter D is D² = 4 r² = 4 (2n+1) R λ → D² =4*(2n+1) R λ.

So D^2 =4*(2n+1)*R*λ.

So, for D=4e-3 m, n=20, λ=500e-9 m.

Compute D^2 = (4e-3)^2= 16e-6 m².

So:

16e-6 =4*(2*20 +1)*R*500e-9 → 16e-6=4*41*R*500e-9.

Compute 4*41=164 → 164 *500e-9 =82e-6.

So, 16e-6 =82e-6 * R → R=16/82 → 8/41≈0.1951 m →19.5 cm.

Same result again. So perhaps the options are using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses R in meters, but I've been calculating R in meters. Or perhaps the problem uses the radius of the ring as the diameter?

Wait, no, diameter is given as 4 mm, so radius is 2 mm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is r^2 = (n) R λ, for bright rings, but that would give even smaller R.

r^2 =n R λ → (0.002)^2=20 R *500e-9 →4e-6 =20 R *5e-7 → 4e-6 =1e-5 R → R=4e-6 /1e-5=0.4 m →40 cm.

Hmm, 40 cm is option F: radius 45 cm, and part b) 6.5 mm. Not matching, but perhaps that's not the right formula.

Wait, let me look at the answer options. Let's see which options have R around 39 cm, like option G or C.

Option G: R=39 cm, 30th ring diameter 4.9 mm.

If R=39 cm, then let's compute for n=20.

r² = (2n+1) R λ → (41) *0.39 m *500e-9.

Wait, 41 *0.39=15.99 m*500e-9=15.99 *5e-7 =7.995e-6 m² → r= sqrt(7.995e-6)≈ 2.84e-3 m → 2.84 mm radius, so diameter is 5.68 mm. But the given diameter is 4 mm, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is r² = (2n) R λ for bright rings. Let's try that.

r²=2n R λ → for n=20, r=2e-3.

So, (2e-3)^2 =40 R *500e-9 →4e-6 =40 R *500e-9 → 4e-6=2e-5 R → R=4e-6 /2e-5=0.2 m=20 cm.

But options don't have 20 cm. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula is r^4 = (2n+1) R^3 λ. No, that doesn't sound right. I think I'm stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently. Maybe the formula is D² = 4(2n +1) R λ, where D is the diameter.

So D² =4*(2n+1)*R*λ.

Given D=4 mm, n=20, λ=500 nm.

Compute D²=16e-6 m².

So, 16e-6=4*(41)*R*500e-9 → 16e-6=164 R*500e-9.

Wait, 164 *500e-9=82e-6.

So, 16e-6=82e-6 R → R=16/82=0.1951 m=19.51 cm.

So R≈19.5 cm. But none of the options match. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses R in centimeters. Let me try plugging in the given options to see which one fits.

Let's take option G: R=39 cm.

For n=20, D²=4*(2*20 +1)*R (in meters)*λ.

So, D²=4*(41)*0.39 *500e-9.

Compute 4*41=164; 164 *0.39=64.026; 64.026 *500e-9=3.2013e-5.

So D²=3.2013e-5 → D=√(3.2013e-5) ≈5.66e-3 m=5.66 mm. But the problem states it's 4 mm, so this option doesn't fit.

Option C: R=39 cm.

Wait, same as option G? No, option C says the radius is 39 cm and diameter 5.5 mm.

Wait, let me compute for R=39 cm.

D²=4*(41)*0.39 *500e-9=4*41*0.39*500e-9.

Which is 4*41=164; 164 *0.39=64.026; 64.026 *500e-9=3.2013e-5 → D=√(3.2013e-5)=5.66 mm. Which is larger than the given 4 mm. So this isn't matching.

Option A: R=50 cm.

D²=4*41*0.5 *500e-9.

4*41=164; 164*.5=82; 82*500e-9=4.1e-5 → D=√(4.1e-5)=6.4e-3 m=6.4 mm. Not matching 4 mm.

Option B: R=35 cm.

D²=4*41*0.35 *500e-9.

4*41=164; 164*.35=57.4; 57.4 *500e-
