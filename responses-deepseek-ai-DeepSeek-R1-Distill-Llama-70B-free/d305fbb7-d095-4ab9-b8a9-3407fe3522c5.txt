Okay, so I've got this question about the second law of thermodynamics. Hmm, I remember that the laws of thermodynamics are fundamental in physics, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to think this through.

The question is asking about the direction of heat flow according to the second law. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one. The key here is understanding what the second law states about heat transfer.

From what I recall, the second law deals with the direction of spontaneous processes. One of the common statements of the second law is that heat naturally flows from an area of higher temperature to an area of lower temperature. This is the natural process; it happens without any external intervention. But if you want heat to flow the other way—like from cold to hot—it won't happen on its own. You need some kind of external work or energy input for that to happen.

So looking at the question, it's asking which option describes the scenario where heat doesn't flow. The question is phrased a bit tricky: "The second law of thermodynamics tells us that heat doesn’t flow from..." So the correct answer should be the situation that the second law prohibits without some external influence.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: hot to cold without external energy. Wait, isn't that the natural process? Heat flows from hot to cold on its own without any external help. So this is allowed, meaning the second law doesn't say it doesn't happen. So A isn't the correct answer.

Option B: cold to hot ever. That's a strong statement. Does the second law say heat never flows from cold to hot? Well, I think in reality, with a refrigerator, heat does flow from cold to hot, but only because external work is being done. So the law doesn't say it never happens, just that it doesn't happen spontaneously. So B might not be correct.

Option C: hot to cold without internal energy. Hmm, internal energy is a bit confusing here. I'm not sure about this option. Internal energy is the total energy in a system. I'm not certain how this ties into the second law directly. Maybe this isn't the right way to think about it.

Option D: cold to hot without a change in state. Change in state refers to phase changes, like liquid to gas. Not sure how this relates. The second law isn't about phase changes but about energy transfer. So probably not D.

Option E: hot to cold without a change in temperature. Wait, if heat flows, the temperatures would change unless it's a phase change. But again, I'm not sure if this is the main point of the second law. Probably not E.

Option F: hot to cold without a change in state. Again, change in state is about phase changes. The second law doesn't prohibit heat transfer based on state changes. So this might not be it.

Option G: cold to hot without internal pressure. Internal pressure relates to the system's state, but I don't think this is the point here. The second law doesn't hinge on internal pressure.

Option H: cold to hot without a change in temperature. That doesn't make much sense. If heat flows from cold to hot, the temperatures would have to adjust, but this isn't directly what the second law addresses. So probably not H.

Option I: hot to cold ever. No, because as I thought earlier, heat does flow from hot to cold naturally. So the second law doesn't say it doesn't happen. So I isn't correct.

Option J: cold to hot without external energy. Ah, this seems familiar. The second law says that heat can't flow from a colder to a hotter body without some external work or energy input. So without external energy, this process won't occur. So J is the correct option.

Wait, but looking back at option B, which says "cold to hot ever." No, because with external energy, it does happen. So B is too absolute. The question is about what doesn't happen, so J is correct because it specifies "without external energy."

The second law of thermodynamics states that heat naturally flows from an area of higher temperature (hot) to an area of lower temperature (cold) without any external intervention. However, for heat to flow in the reverse direction—from cold to hot—it requires external energy or work. This means that the second law prohibits heat from flowing from cold to hot without external energy.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Heat flows from hot to cold without external energy—this is natural and allowed, so this is not correct.  
- **B**: Heat never flows from cold to hot—this is incorrect because heat can flow from cold to hot with external energy.  
- **C**: Heat doesn't flow from hot to cold without internal energy—this is irrelevant to the second law.  
- **D**: Heat doesn't flow from cold to hot without a change in state—this is unrelated to the second law.  
- **E**: Heat doesn't flow from hot to cold without a change in temperature—this is incorrect because heat flow typically causes temperature changes.  
- **F**: Heat doesn't flow from hot to cold without a change in state—this is incorrect because the second law does not depend on phase changes.  
- **G**: Heat doesn't flow from cold to hot without internal pressure—this is irrelevant to the second law.  
- **H**: Heat doesn't flow from cold to hot without a change in temperature—this is incorrect because temperature changes are not the focus of the second law.  
- **I**: Heat doesn't flow from hot to cold ever—this is incorrect because heat naturally flows from hot to cold.  
- **J**: Heat doesn't flow from cold to hot without external energy—this is correct because the second law prohibits this without external energy.

Thus, the correct answer is **J**.
