    <think>


To solve \( \frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{8} \), I need to subtract the two fractions. 

First, I find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 4 and 8, and the least common denominator is 8.

Next, I convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 8. Multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 2 gives \( \frac{6}{8} \).

Now, I subtract \( \frac{1}{8} \) from \( \frac{6}{8} \):
\[
\frac{6}{8} - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{5}{8}.
\]

The result of the subtraction is \( \frac{5}{8} \), which corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
