C: 2200.0
D: 2100.0
E: 1400.0
F: 1600.0
G: 1800.0

To determine the mean molecular speed \( v \) of hydrogen gas (\( H_2 \)), we can use the formula derived from the kinetic theory of gases:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{8RT}{\pi M}}
\]

Where:
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(molÂ·K)} \) is the universal gas constant,
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin,
- \( M \) is the molar mass of hydrogen gas.

For hydrogen gas (\( H_2 \)):
- The molar mass \( M \) is approximately \( 2.016 \, \text{g/mol} \), which is \( 0.002016 \, \text{kg/mol} \).

Assuming the temperature \( T \) is room temperature, typically \( 298 \, \text{K} \), we can plug in the values:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{8 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 298}{\pi \cdot 0.002016}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
8 \cdot 8.314 = 66.512
\]
\[
66.512 \cdot 298 = 19,828.576
\]

Now calculate the denominator:
\[
\pi \cdot 0.002016 \approx 0.006332
\]

Now divide the numerator by the denominator:
\[
\frac{19,828.576}{0.006332} \approx 3,135,000
\]

Finally, take the square root:
\[
v = \sqrt{3,135,000} \approx 1,770 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Comparing this result to the provided options, the closest value is **C: 2200.0 m/s**.
