Question:

A college student and her boyfriend lived together in a one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles. They were engaged to be married when they purchased an undeveloped parcel of land on a hillside overlooking the Pacific. The deed, which was properly executed and recorded, named the student and the boyfriend as grantees, "not as tenants in common but as joint tenants with right of survivorship. "Thereafter, the boyfriend, who was experiencing financial difficulties, offered to sell the property to his co-worker. Without the student's knowledge, the boyfriend executed a deed that purported to convey the hillside property to the co-worker in fee simple. The boyfriend signed his name and forged the student's name. He then delivered the deed of conveyance to the co-worker, who paid the boyfriend $150,000, which was the fair market value of the property. The co-worker immediately recorded the deed received from the boyfriend. The common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. Title to the property in question is now in

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me read it carefully.

So, the setup is a college student and her boyfriend bought a parcel of land. The deed says they're joint tenants with the right of survivorship. That means if one dies, the other gets the whole property, right? Joint tenancy typically includes the four unities: time, title, interest, and possession. Also, the right of survivorship is a key feature.

Then, the boyfriend is having financial trouble and offers to sell the property to his coworker. He executed a deed to convey the property to the coworker in fee simple. He signed his name and forged the student's name. Then, he delivered the deed, got $150k, which is the fair market value, and the coworker recorded it immediately.

The question is about who owns the property now. The options are from A to J.

I remember that in joint tenancy, each joint tenant has an equal and undivided interest. If one joint tenant sells their interest, it's supposed to sever the joint tenancy, turning it into a tenancy in common. But wait, can one joint tenant unilaterally sever the tenancy?

Wait, but in this case, the boyfriend didn't just sell his own interest; he forged the student's name. So he's trying to transfer both his and her interests. But does that actually work?

At common law, joint tenancy can be severed in several ways: by one tenant selling their interest, or by a mortgage, or by a mutual agreement. But if one joint tenant forges the other's name on a deed, is that a valid transfer?

I think that a forged signature doesn't count. Because for a deed to be valid, it needs to be delivered by the grantor with the intent to transfer. If the student didn't sign, then the deed isn't valid as to her interest.

So the boyfriend, as a joint tenant, owns 50% of the property. He can convey his 50% interest to the coworker. But the student's interest can't be transferred without her consent. So the coworker would get the boyfriend's half, but the student still owns the other half.

Wait, but when the boyfriend conveys his interest, does that sever the joint tenancy? Because once a joint tenant transfers their interest, the joint tenancy is severed, and it becomes a tenancy in common between the remaining owner and the new owner.

So in this case, if the boyfriend sells his 50% interest, the joint tenancy is severed. So the student would now own 50%, and the coworker would own 50% as tenants in common.

But wait, the deed that the boyfriend created was a forgery, so the student's interest wasn't actually transferred. So the coworker only gets the boyfriend's interest. So the coworker and the student would each own 50% as tenants in common.

Wait, but the question is about the title now. So the options are:

Looking at the options:

Option G: co-worker and student as tenants in common.

Option D: co-worker and boyfriend as tenants in common. But the boyfriend no longer has any interest because he sold his half. Or does he?

Wait, the boyfriend forged the student's name, so when he delivered the deed, the coworker paid him. But the deed was supposed to transfer both interests. But since the student's signature was forged, the coworker only gets the boyfriend's interest.

So the coworker gets the boyfriend's 50%, and the student keeps her 50%. So now, the student and coworker are tenants in common each owning 50%. So the title is with them as tenants in common.

Looking at the options, option G is "the co-worker and the student as tenants in common." That seems to fit.

But wait, another angle: if the boyfriend forged the deed, is the deed entirely invalid, meaning neither the boyfriend's nor the student's interest was transferred? Because a deed requires both parties' signatures if they're joint tenants. So if the student didn't sign, the deed is invalid as to her, but the boyfriend can still transfer his own interest.

So the coworker gets the boyfriend's 50%, and the student has her 50%. So they are tenants in common.

Alternatively, if the deed is a forgery, does it affect the transfer of the boyfriend's own interest? I think a person can convey their own interest even if they forge another's signature. Because for their own interest, the signature is genuine. The forgery affects the other person's interest, but not their own.

So in that case, the coworker gets the boyfriend's 50%, and the student keeps her 50%. So they become tenants in common.

So the correct answer should be G. But let me think again.

Wait, another point: when a joint tenant transfers their interest, does that sever the joint tenancy? Yes, it does. So the student and the boyfriend were joint tenants. When the boyfriend transfers his interest to the coworker, the joint tenancy is severed. So now, the student and coworker are tenants in common. So the title is in the student and coworker as tenants in common.

So yes, option G is correct.

Wait, but I also remember that for a deed to be effective, the grantor must have the authority to transfer. Since the student didn't sign, the deed can't transfer her interest. So the coworker only gets the boyfriend's interest. So the student still has her 50%, and the coworker has 50% from the boyfriend. Therefore, G is correct.

Looking back at the options:

Option G: the co-worker and the student as tenants in common.

Yes.

In this scenario, the college student and her boyfriend purchased property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. Joint tenancy requires the four unities (time, title, interest, and possession) and includes the right of survivorship, meaning that if one joint tenant dies, the other automatically inherits the entire property. However, joint tenancy can be severed if one joint tenant transfers their interest, which then converts the ownership into a tenancy in common.

The boyfriend, facing financial difficulties, forged the student's name on a deed and transferred the property to his co-worker in fee simple. For a deed to be valid, it must be signed by the grantor with the intent to transfer. While the boyfriend's signature was genuine, the student's signature was forged, meaning her interest could not be legally transferred. As a result, the boyfriend could only transfer his own 50% interest in the property to the co-worker. This action severed the joint tenancy, and the ownership became a tenancy in common between the student (who retained her 50% interest) and the co-worker (who acquired the boyfriend's 50% interest).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The co-worker, student, and boyfriend cannot all be joint tenants with the right of survivorship because the joint tenancy was severed when the boyfriend transferred his interest.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The co-worker does not own the property in fee simple because the student retains her 50% interest.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The boyfriend and student are no longer joint tenants because the joint tenancy was severed.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The co-worker and boyfriend are not tenants in common because the boyfriend no longer has an interest in the property.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The co-worker and student are not joint tenants with the right of survivorship because the joint tenancy was severed.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The co-worker and boyfriend are not joint tenants with the right of survivorship because the boyfriend no longer has an interest in the property.
- **Option G**: Correct. The co-worker and student are tenants in common, each owning a 50% interest in the property.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The co-worker, student, and boyfriend are not all tenants in common because the boyfriend no longer has an interest in the property.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The boyfriend does not own the property in fee simple because he transferred his 50% interest to the co-worker.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The student does not own the property in fee simple because the boyfriend transferred his 50% interest to the co-worker.

Thus, the correct answer is **G: the co-worker and the student as tenants in common**.

Answer: G
