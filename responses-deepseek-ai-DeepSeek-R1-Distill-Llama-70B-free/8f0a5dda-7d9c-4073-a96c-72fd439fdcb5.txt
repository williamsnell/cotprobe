Okay, so I've got this question about personnel selection, and I'm a bit new to this topic. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking about the definition of the selection ratio. I remember that in HR or organizational behavior, the selection ratio is some kind of metric used when hiring. But I'm not exactly sure what it entails.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ratio of successful to unsuccessful workers. Hmm, that sounds like maybe a success rate, but I'm not sure if that's what selection ratio means. I think selection ratio is more about the number of people selected compared to the number of applicants.

Option B: Ratio of successful selected workers to the difficulty level of the job. Wait, that doesn't sound right. The difficulty level is a separate factor; I don't think the selection ratio involves that. It's probably just a numerical ratio between two groups of people.

Option C: Percent of workers correctly placed in the group hired. That sounds more like a placement accuracy or effectiveness measure, not the selection ratio. I think selection ratio is about how many are chosen versus how many applied, not about how correct the placements were.

Option D: Ratio of the number of workers needed to the number of applicants available. Oh, this rings a bell. I've heard that selection ratio is about the proportion of people selected relative to those who applied. So if a company needs 10 workers and there are 50 applicants, the selection ratio is 10/50, which is 0.2 or 20%. That makes sense because it's about how selective the process is.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing it with something else. The selection ratio could also relate to how many were selected versus how many were eligible or something. But option D seems to align with what I remember. It's the ratio of open positions (workers needed) to applicants.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D.

The selection ratio in personnel selection is the ratio of the number of workers needed to the number of applicants available. This metric helps understand how selective the hiring process is.
