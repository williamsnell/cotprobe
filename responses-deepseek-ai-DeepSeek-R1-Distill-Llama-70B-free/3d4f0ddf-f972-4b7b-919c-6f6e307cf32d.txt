Question:

A 5-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents for evaluation of recurrent injuries. Her parents say that she started walking at the age of 14 months and since then has always seemed clumsier and had more injuries than other children. She has had increasingly frequent chest pain with exertion since starting a soccer program 3 months ago. She usually has pain or swelling of her knees or ankles after practice. She has been wearing glasses for 2 years. Her 16-year-old brother has required two operations for a severe rotator cuff injury he sustained while taking a shower, and she has a maternal cousin who died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at the age of 26 years. Today, the patient walks with a limp. She is at the 99th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. A midsystolic click is heard at the apex. The left ankle is swollen and tender; range of motion is limited by pain. The joints of the upper and lower extremities are hypermobile, including 25 degrees of genu recurvatum, thumbs that may be extended to touch the forearms, and flexibility at the waist, with palms easily touching the floor with straight knees. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

Options:

A: Skeletal survey
B: Echocardiography
C: Bone scan
D: MRI of the shoulder

Okay, so I've got this medical question to tackle. Let me read through it carefully and think through what's going on here.

So, the patient is a 5-year-old girl with a history of recurrent injuries. She started walking late at 14 months and has been clumsy since, having more injuries than other kids. She's been having chest pain during exertion since she started soccer three months ago. After practices, she usually gets pain or swelling in her knees or ankles. She's been wearing glasses for two years. Family history is significant: her 16-year-old brother had two operations for a severe rotator cuff injury that happened while he was taking a shower. There's also a maternal cousin who died from a ruptured aortic aneurysm at age 26. 

On physical exam, she walks with a limp. She's tall—99th percentile for height—and average weight (50th percentile). There's a midsystolic click heard at the apex. Her left ankle is swollen and tender, with limited range of motion due to pain. Her joints are hypermobile: 25 degrees of genu recurvatum (that's like hyperextending the knees), thumbs can extend to touch her forearms, and she can bend at the waist so her palms touch the floor with straight knees.

The question is asking for the most appropriate next step in diagnosis. The options are A through D, which are skeletal survey, echocardiography, bone scan, and MRI of the shoulder.

Hmm. Let's break this down. The key points I notice are the hypermobile joints, tall stature, family history of aortic aneurysm, and the midsystolic click. Also, chest pain with exertion.

So, hypermobile joints make me think of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), specifically the hypermobile type. But wait, EDS can also have other complications. The family history of a ruptured aortic aneurysm is a big red flag. Aortic aneurysms are associated with certain types of EDS, particularly the vascular type, but also with Marfan syndrome.

Wait, Marfan syndrome... The girl is tall, which fits with Marfan. Marfan often presents with tall stature, joint hypermobility, and aortic root dilatation leading to aneurysms. Also, midsystolic click could indicate mitral valve prolapse, which is common in Marfan.

So, the chest pain with exertion might be related to cardiac issues. In Marfan, aortic dilation can lead to a risk of dissection or rupture, especially during exertion. The midsystolic click suggests mitral valve prolapse, which is a common feature in Marfan.

The family history: brother with a severe rotator cuff injury. Rotator cuff tears can be associated with EDS or Marfan. The cousin's death from a ruptured aortic aneurysm at 26 is highly suggestive of a genetic aortopathy like Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos (vascular type). 

So, considering all this, the most likely diagnosis is Marfan syndrome. The next step would be to assess for aortic root dilation and mitral valve prolapse. Echocardiography is the standard test for evaluating the heart structure in such cases. It would show if there's any aortic root dilation or mitral valve issues.

Looking at the options:

A: Skeletal survey—this is more for looking at bones, maybe for fractures or osteoporosis, but not the immediate concern here.

B: Echocardiography—this seems spot on because we need to check for aortic and mitral valve issues.

C: Bone scan—used for detecting bone abnormalities, metastases, infections, or fractures, but not the primary issue here.

D: MRI of the shoulder—her brother had a rotator cuff injury, but she's presenting with ankle issues. MRI of shoulder isn't indicated here.

So, the next step is echocardiography to evaluate the heart for features of Marfan syndrome.

The patient is a 5-year-old girl with a history of recurrent injuries, clumsiness, and joint hypermobility. She has tall stature (99th percentile for height) and a family history significant for aortic aneurysm (maternal cousin died at 26) and severe rotator cuff injury (16-year-old brother). Physical exam reveals hypermobile joints, a midsystolic click at the apex, and chest pain with exertion. These findings suggest Marfan syndrome, which is associated with tall stature, joint hypermobility, aortic root dilation, and mitral valve prolapse. The midsystolic click is consistent with mitral valve prolapse, a common feature of Marfan syndrome. The chest pain with exertion raises concern for aortic root dilation or other cardiac complications.

Given the need to evaluate the heart for aortic root dilation and mitral valve prolapse, echocardiography is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis. Other options, such as skeletal survey or bone scan, are less relevant to the primary concerns here. MRI of the shoulder is not indicated as the patient’s current issues do not involve the shoulder.
