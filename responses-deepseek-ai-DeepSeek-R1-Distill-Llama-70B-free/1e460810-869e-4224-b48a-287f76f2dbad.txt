Okay, so I've got this problem here about determining the mass and specific volume of argon gas in a vessel. Hmm, let me see. The vessel is spherical with a radius of 5 meters. The conditions are 150 kPa and 20°C. I remember that to find mass and specific volume, I probably need to use the ideal gas law. But wait, argon is a noble gas, right? So at these conditions, it should behave like an ideal gas.

First, let me jot down what I know. The vessel is a sphere, so its volume can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is (4/3)πr³. The radius is 5 meters, so plugging that in: (4/3) * π * (5)^3. Let me compute that. 5 cubed is 125, multiplied by 4/3 gives about 166.666... then multiplied by π (approximately 3.1416) gives around 523.598 cubic meters. So V ≈ 523.6 m³.

Next, I need the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. But wait, I need the mass, so maybe I should use the specific gas constant for argon. Oh right, because R is the universal gas constant, but when dealing with mass, we use R_specific (R_s), which is R divided by the molar mass.

So, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, and the molar mass of argon is about 39.948 g/mol. Oh wait, but I need to convert that to kg. So 39.948 g is 0.039948 kg/mol. So R_s for argon would be R divided by molar mass. So R_s = 8.314 / 0.039948 ≈ let's calculate that. 8.314 divided by 0.039948. Hmm, 8.314 / 0.04 is approximately 207.85, but since it's 0.039948, it's a bit higher. Let me do it more accurately. 0.039948 * 208 = 8.3 (approx). So R_s ≈ 208 J/kg·K.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 39.948 g/mol is 0.039948 kg/mol. So R_s = 8.314 / 0.039948. Let me compute that more precisely. 8.314 / 0.039948 ≈ Let's see, 0.039948 times 208 is 0.039948 *200=7.9896, 0.039948 *8=0.319584. Sum is 8.309184. So 8.314 is a bit more. 0.039948 *208.05 ≈ 8.314. So R_s ≈ 208.05 J/kg·K.

So, the ideal gas equation can be written as PV = mRT, where m is mass, and R is the specific gas constant. So rearranging, mass m = (P V) / (R_s T).

But wait, pressure is given as 150 kPa. So I need to convert that to Pascals because R is in J/kg·K (=m²/s²·K). So 150 kPa is 150,000 Pa.

Temperature is 20°C, which is 293.15 K.

So, putting the numbers together:

m = (150,000 Pa * 523.598 m³) / (208.05 J/kg·K * 293.15 K)

Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 150,000 * 523.598. Let me compute that. 150,000 * 500 is 75,000,000, and 150,000 * 23.598 is 3,539,700. So total is about 78,539,700 Pa·m³ (which is equivalent to Joules, since 1 J = 1 Pa·m³).

Denominator: 208.05 * 293.15 ≈ Let me approximate. 200 * 293 is 58,600. Then 8.05 * 293.15 ≈ 2,358. So total is around 58,600 + 2,358 = 60,958 J/kg.

So m ≈ 78,539,700 / 60,958 ≈ let's compute that. 78,539,700 ÷ 60,958. Let me see, 60,958 * 1288 ≈ ?

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach. Let me compute 78539700 ÷ 60958.

Divide both by 1000: 78539.7 / 60.958 ≈ let me compute 78539700 ÷ 60958.

Hmm, perhaps approximate. Let me do 60,958 * 1288 = ?

1288 * 60,000 = 77,280,000. 1288 * 958 = approx 1,234,  so total would be 77,280,000 + 1,234,000 = 78,514,000. That's really close to our numerator of ~78,539,700. So m is approximately 1288 kg.

Wait, wait, because 60,958 * 1288 is 78,514,  so 78,539,700 is a bit higher. So perhaps 1288.5 kg or so. So the mass is about 1288 kg.

Now specific volume is the reciprocal of density. Density is mass/volume, so specific volume v = V/m.

So v = 523.598 m³ / 1288 kg ≈ let's calculate that. 523.598 / 1288. 1288 is about 1300, so 523.6/1300 is about 0.4027 m³/kg. Hmm, that's approximately 0.403 m³/kg. Let me check more precisely.

523.598 ÷ 1288. Let's compute:

1288 * 0.4065 = let's see: 1288 * 0.4 is 515.2. 1288 * 0.0065 is approx 8.37. So total is 515.2 +8.37=523.57. Oh, which is exactly the volume. So 0.4065 m³/kg.

So mass is approximately 1288 kg, specific volume 0.4065 m³/kg.

Looking at the options, option B says mass=1288 kg, specific volume=0.4065 m³/kg. So the correct answer is B.

To determine the mass and specific volume of argon gas in the spherical vessel, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate the volume of the vessel**:  
   The vessel is spherical with a radius of 5 m. The volume of a sphere is given by:  
   \[
   V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
   \]  
   Substituting \(r = 5 \, \text{m}\):  
   \[
   V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (5)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (125) \approx 523.598 \, \text{m}^3
   \]

2. **Ideal gas law**:  
   The ideal gas law is expressed as:  
   \[
   PV = m R_s T
   \]  
   Where:  
   - \(P = 150 \, \text{kPa} = 150,000 \, \text{Pa}\)  
   - \(V = 523.598 \, \text{m}^3\)  
   - \(T = 20^\circ \text{C} = 293.15 \, \text{K}\)  
   - \(R_s = \frac{R}{M} = \frac{8.314}{0.039948} \approx 208.05 \, \text{J/kg·K}\)  

   Rearranging for mass \(m\):  
   \[
   m = \frac{P V}{R_s T}
   \]  

3. **Calculate the mass**:  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   m = \frac{150,000 \cdot 523.598}{208.05 \cdot 293.15}
   \]  
   - Numerator: \(150,000 \cdot 523.598 = 78,539,700 \, \text{J}\)  
   - Denominator: \(208.05 \cdot 293.15 \approx 60,958 \, \text{J/kg}\)  
   - Mass:  
     \[
     m = \frac{78,539,700}{60,958} \approx 1288 \, \text{kg}
     \]

4. **Calculate the specific volume**:  
   Specific volume is the reciprocal of density, given by:  
   \[
   v = \frac{V}{m}
   \]  
   Substituting \(V = 523.598 \, \text{m}^3\) and \(m = 1288 \, \text{kg}\):  
   \[
   v = \frac{523.598}{1288} \approx 0.4065 \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg}
   \]

5. **Match with the options**:  
   The calculated mass (\(1288 \, \text{kg}\)) and specific volume (\(0.4065 \, \text{m}^3/\text{kg}\)) match **Option B**.
