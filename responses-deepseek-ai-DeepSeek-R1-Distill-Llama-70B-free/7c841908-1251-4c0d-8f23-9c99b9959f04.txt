Question:

In the early 1900's, many fruit growers made a practice of ripening fruits by keeping them in a room with a kerosene stove. They believed it was the heat that ripened the fruits. Was this belief based on correct facts? Explain your answer.

Options:

A: The ripening was caused by the soot from the kerosene stove settling on the fruits.
B: The fruits ripened due to the carbon dioxide produced by the kerosene stove.
C: The fruits ripened faster due to increased humidity from the kerosene stove.
D: It was the incomplete combustion products of the kerosene, identified as ethylene, that ripened the fruits.
E: The fruits ripened naturally without any influence from the kerosene stove.
F: It was the light emitted by the kerosene stove that accelerated the ripening process.
G: The fruits ripened due to the ozone produced by the kerosene stove.
H: The ripening was facilitated by the slight increase in temperature, not directly related to the heat of the stove.
I: The kerosene stove released a specific ripening hormone that caused the fruits to ripen.
J: It was the heat from the kerosene stove that ripened the fruits.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about fruit ripening in the early 1900s. Let me break it down step by step.

The question says that fruit growers used a kerosene stove in a room to ripen fruits, and they thought the heat was causing it. But was that belief correct?

Hmm, I remember that fruits ripen because of certain gases they produce. Oh right, ethylene gas is a big one. I think plants release ethylene as they ripen, and it acts as a ripening hormone. So, if the kerosene stove was involved, maybe it's not just the heat.

Wait, what happens when kerosene burns? Incomplete combustion of kerosene can produce various gases, including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and maybe other hydrocarbons. I've heard that ethylene is a hydrocarbon, so perhaps the stove's incomplete combustion produces ethylene.

So, the growers thought heat was the reason, but maybe it's actually the ethylene from the stove's fumes that caused ripening. That would mean their belief was incorrect because it's not the heat but the ethylene.

Looking at the options, option D says it's the incomplete combustion products, specifically ethylene, that caused ripening. That makes sense. Option J says it's the heat, which the growers believed, but we think that's wrong.

Wait, what about other options? Option B is about CO2. I know CO2 is a product of combustion, but does it ripen fruits? Not as much as ethylene, I think. High CO2 can actually slow down ripening in some cases.

Option A talks about soot. Soot is particles, but I don't think soot directly causes ripening. Maybe it's a distractor.

Option H suggests a slight temperature increase, but the stove would produce more than a slight change. Plus, if the main factor was heat, then J would be correct, but I think it's D.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be D. The ripening was due to ethylene from incomplete combustion, not the heat they believed.

The fruit growers believed that the heat from the kerosene stove was ripening the fruits, but this belief was incorrect. The actual cause of ripening was the ethylene gas produced by the incomplete combustion of kerosene. Ethylene is a natural ripening hormone for fruits, and its presence in the fumes from the stove accelerated the ripening process. Therefore, the correct explanation is that the ripening was due to ethylene, not the heat.

Answer: D
