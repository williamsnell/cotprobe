Okay, so I've got this problem here about partial molar volumes and volume change upon mixing. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

Alright, the question says we have a solution where the mole fraction of water is 0.45 at 25°C. The partial molar volumes of water and ethanol are given as 17.0 cm³/mol and 57.5 cm³/mol, respectively. We need to find the volume change when mixing enough ethanol with 3.75 moles of water to get this concentration. Also, the densities of water and ethanol are provided: 0.997 g/cm³ for water and 0.7893 g/cm³ for ethanol.

Wait, partial molar volume... Right, the partial molar volume of a component in a mixture is the change in volume when adding a mole of that component, keeping the other components' mole numbers constant. So the total volume of the solution is the sum of the partial molar volumes multiplied by their respective moles.

But wait, the volume change upon mixing is the difference between the total volume after mixing and the sum of the volumes each component would occupy before mixing. So I need to find the volume before mixing (from pure components) and the volume after mixing, then subtract them to get the change.

First, let me figure out how much ethanol is in the solution. Since the mole fraction of water is 0.45, that means x_H2O = 0.45. So the mole fraction of ethanol must be 1 - 0.45 = 0.55.

We have 3.75 moles of water. So, using the mole fractions, the total number of moles in the solution would be n_total = n_water / x_water = 3.75 / 0.45. Let me calculate that: 3.75 divided by 0.45 is 8.333... So approximately 8.333 moles in total.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me recheck. Oh, wait, the mole fraction x_water is 0.45, so n_water = x_water * n_total. So n_total = n_water / x_water = 3.75 / 0.45. Yes, that's correct, which is about 8.333 moles total.

So moles of ethanol would be n_ethanol = n_total * x_ethanol = 8.333 * 0.55. Let's calculate that: 8.333 * 0.55 is approximately 4.583 moles. Alternatively, since n_water is 3.75 and n_total is 8.333, n_ethanol is 8.333 - 3.75 = 4.583 moles. Same result.

Now, the volume after mixing is the sum of each component's partial molar volume multiplied by their moles. So V_solution = (V_water * n_water) + (V_ethanol * n_ethanol).

Plugging in the numbers: V_water_part = 17.0 cm³/mol * 3.75 mol = 63.75 cm³. V_ethanol_part = 57.5 cm³/mol * 4.583 mol. Let me compute that: 57.5 * 4.583. Hmm, 57.5 * 4 is 230, 57.5 * 0.583 is about 57.5 * 0.5 is 28.75, 57.5 * 0.083 is around 4.7875. So total is approximately 230 + 28.75 + 4.7875 = 263.5375 cm³. So V_solution is 63.75 + 263.5375 = 327.2875 cm³. Let me double-check that calculation, maybe I should do it more accurately.

Wait, alternatively, using exact numbers. n_ethanol is (1 - 0.45)/0.45 * 3.75? Wait, no, n_ethanol is n_total - n_water. Since n_total is 3.75 / 0.45 = 8.333... So n_ethanol is 8.333... - 3.75 = 4.583333... mol.

So V_ethanol_part = 57.5 cm³/mol * 4.583333 mol. Let me compute that precisely. 57.5 * 4 is 230, 57.5 * 0.583333 is 57.5 * (7/12) because 0.583333 is approximately 7/12. 7/12 of 57.5 is 57.5 * 7 = 402.5, divided by 12 is about 33.5417. So 230 + 33.5417 = 263.5417 cm³. So V_solution is 17 * 3.75 = 63.75 cm³ plus 263.5417 cm³, totaling 327.2917 cm³.

Now, the volume before mixing is the sum of the volumes of pure water and pure ethanol used. So I need to find the volume each component would occupy as pure substances.

For water: moles of water is 3.75 mol. The density of water is 0.997 g/cm³. The molar mass of water is about 18.015 g/mol. So the volume of pure water is n_water * molar mass / density.

So volume_water_pure = (3.75 mol) * (18.015 g/mol) / 0.997 g/cm³. Let me compute that: 3.75 * 18.015 = let's see, 3 * 18 is 54, 0.75 * 18 is 13.5, so 3.75 * 18=67.5. But exact calculation: 3.75 * 18.015 = ?

Wait, 18.015 * 3 =54.045, 18.015 * 0.75 = 13.51125. Sum is 54.045 +13.51125 =67.55625 g. Then, dividing by 0.997 g/cm³: 67.55625 / 0.997 ≈ let's compute this.

Approximately, 67.55625 / 1 = 67.55625, so with divisor 0.997, it's a bit higher. Let me compute 67.55625 / 0.997. Let's do 67.55625 ÷ 0.997 ≈ 67.55625 * (1/0.997) ≈ 67.55625 * 1.003 ≈ 67.55625 + (0.003 * 67.55625). 0.003 * 67.55625 is approximately 0.2027. So total ≈ 67.75895 cm³.

Alternatively, exact calculation: 67.55625 ÷ 0.997.

Wait, 0.997 is approximately 1 - 0.003. So 1/0.997 ≈ 1 + 0.003 + (0.003)^2... Using approximation for division.

Using a calculator approach:

67.55625 ÷ 0.997:

Let me compute 0.997 * 67.75 = ?

0.997 *67 is 66.799, 0.997 *0.75 is 0.74775. So 66.799 + 0.74775 = 67.54675. That's very close to 67.55625.

So 0.997 * 67.75 =67.54675. The target is 67.55625. The difference is 67.55625 -67.54675 = 0.0095.

So each additional 0.01 in the multiplier (67.75 + 0.01) would add 0.997 *0.01=0.00997. So to get 0.0095, 0.01 * (0.0095/0.00997) ≈ 0.01 *0.953 ≈ 0.00953. So the multiplier is approximately 67.75 + 0.00953 ≈ 67.75953.

So volume_water_pure ≈ 67.7595 cm³.

Now for ethanol. The moles of ethanol are 4.583333. Molar mass of ethanol is C2H5OH: 2*12.01 +6*1.008 +16.00 +1.008? Wait, let me calculate:

Ethanol is C2H5OH, which is C2H6O. So molar mass is (2*12.01) + (6*1.008) + 16.00. So 24.02 + 6.048 +16 = 46.068 g/mol.

Density of ethanol is 0.7893 g/cm³. So volume_ethanol_pure = n_ethanol * molar_mass / density.

n_ethanol is 4.583333 mol. So molar_mass * n = 46.068 *4.583333 = ?

Let me compute 46.068 *4 = 184.272, 46.068 *0.583333 ≈ let's see: 0.5 *46.068 is 23.034, 0.083333*46.068 ≈ approx 3.843. So total for 4.583333 is 184.272 +23.034 +3.843 = 211.149 g.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute 46.068 *4.583333 more accurately.

4 times 46.068 is 184.272. 0.583333 is 7/12, so 7/12 of 46.068 is (46.068 *7)/12.

46.068 *7 = 322.476. 322.476 /12 ≈ 26.873. So 4.583333 *46.068 = 184.272 +26.873 = 211.145 g.

So volume_ethanol_pure = 211.145 g / 0.7893 g/cm³ ≈ let's compute this.

Dividing 211.145 by 0.7893:

0.7893 * 267 = let's see, 0.7893 *200=157.86, 0.7893*67= approx 52.8, so 157.86+52.8=210.66. That's close to 211.145.

So 267 gives 210.66. The difference is 211.145 -210.66=0.485. 0.7893 per 1 unit, so 0.485 /0.7893≈ 0.614. So the volume is approximately 267.614 cm³.

Wait, let me do it more accurately.

Compute 211.145 ÷ 0.7893.

We know 0.7893 * 267 = 210.6601.

211.145 -210.6601 =0.4849.

Now, 0.4849 ÷ 0.7893 ≈ 0.614. So the total is ≈267.614 cm³.

So volume_ethanol_pure ≈267.614 cm³.

So the total volume before mixing is volume_water_pure + volume_ethanol_pure ≈67.7595 +267.614 ≈335.3735 cm³.

Wait, earlier I found the volume after mixing is approximately 327.2917 cm³.

So the volume change upon mixing is V_after - V_before = 327.2917 - 335.3735 ≈-8.0818 cm³. So approximately -8.08 cm³.

Looking at the options, option F is -8 cm³. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me cross-validate the calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.

Wait another approach: the volume change is the sum of (n_i * V_i) for each component after mixing minus the sum of the pure component volumes.

Which is exactly what I did.

Wait, another thing: partial molar volumes are given, so V_solution is correct as sum of n_i * V_i. So I think my approach is right.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the moles of ethanol. Because if x_water is 0.45, then the solution's total moles are 3.75 /0.45 =8.3333..., so ethanol is 8.3333 -3.75=4.5833 moles. That part is correct.

Wait, the volume after mixing is 3.75 *17 +4.5833 *57.5= 63.75 + (4.5833 *57.5).

Compute 4.5833 *57.5: 4*57.5=230, 0.5833 *57.5≈33.5417. So total 263.5417. So 63.75+263.5417=327.2917 cm³.

Volume before mixing is pure water volume (3.75 mol) and pure ethanol (4.5833 mol).

Water: 3.75 *18.015 /0.997 = let me compute it again.

3.75 *18.015=67.55625 g. Divided by 0.997=67.55625/0.997≈67.758 cm³.

Ethanol: 4.5833 mol *46.068 g/mol = let's compute 4.5833*46.068.

4 *46.068=184.272.

0.5833 *46.068: 0.5 *46.068=23.034, 0.0833 *46.068≈3.843. So 23.034+3.843=26.877.

184.272 +26.877=211.149 g. Divided by 0.7893 g/cm³ gives 211.149/0.7893≈267.61 cm³.

Adding 67.758 and 267.61 gives 335.368 cm³.

So V_after is 327.2917, V_before is 335.368.

Change is 327.2917 -335.368= -8.0763 cm³. So approximately -8.08 cm³. The closest option is F: -8 cm³.

So the answer should be F.

To calculate the volume change upon mixing, we need to determine the total volume of the solution after mixing and subtract the total volume of the pure components before mixing.

### Step 1: Determine the moles of ethanol
The mole fraction of water is given as \( x_{\text{H}_2\text{O}} = 0.45 \), so the mole fraction of ethanol is \( x_{\text{ethanol}} = 1 - 0.45 = 0.55 \). The total number of moles in the solution is:

\[
n_{\text{total}} = \frac{n_{\text{H}_2\text{O}}}{x_{\text{H}_2\text{O}}} = \frac{3.75}{0.45} \approx 8.333 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of ethanol are:

\[
n_{\text{ethanol}} = n_{\text{total}} \cdot x_{\text{ethanol}} = 8.333 \cdot 0.55 \approx 4.583 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total volume after mixing
The total volume of the solution is the sum of the partial molar volumes of water and ethanol, multiplied by their respective moles:

\[
V_{\text{solution}} = (V_{\text{H}_2\text{O}} \cdot n_{\text{H}_2\text{O}}) + (V_{\text{ethanol}} \cdot n_{\text{ethanol}}),
\]

where \( V_{\text{H}_2\text{O}} = 17.0 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{mol} \) and \( V_{\text{ethanol}} = 57.5 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{mol} \). Substituting the values:

\[
V_{\text{solution}} = (17.0 \cdot 3.75) + (57.5 \cdot 4.583) \approx 63.75 + 263.54 \approx 327.29 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total volume before mixing
The total volume before mixing is the sum of the volumes of pure water and pure ethanol. The volume of each pure component is calculated using the formula:

\[
V_{\text{pure}} = \frac{n \cdot M}{\rho},
\]

where \( M \) is the molar mass and \( \rho \) is the density.

#### Pure water:
The molar mass of water is \( M_{\text{H}_2\text{O}} = 18.015 \, \text{g/mol} \), and its density is \( \rho_{\text{H}_2\text{O}} = 0.997 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \). The volume of pure water is:

\[
V_{\text{H}_2\text{O, pure}} = \frac{3.75 \cdot 18.015}{0.997} \approx \frac{67.556}{0.997} \approx 67.76 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

#### Pure ethanol:
The molar mass of ethanol is \( M_{\text{ethanol}} = 46.068 \, \text{g/mol} \), and its density is \( \rho_{\text{ethanol}} = 0.7893 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \). The volume of pure ethanol is:

\[
V_{\text{ethanol, pure}} = \frac{4.583 \cdot 46.068}{0.7893} \approx \frac{211.15}{0.7893} \approx 267.61 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The total volume before mixing is:

\[
V_{\text{before}} = V_{\text{H}_2\text{O, pure}} + V_{\text{ethanol, pure}} \approx 67.76 + 267.61 \approx 335.37 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the volume change upon mixing
The volume change upon mixing is:

\[
\Delta V = V_{\text{after}} - V_{\text{before}} = 327.29 - 335.37 \approx -8.08 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to the calculated volume change is:

**F: -8 cm³**

Answer: F
