Question:

Define `marginalism' (as used in economics).

Options:

A: Marginalism is the study of economic trends.
B: Marginalism is the method of analysis that assesses the impact of changes in production volume on total satisfaction.
C: Marginalism is the method of analysis focusing on the first unit in production.
D: Marginalism is the study of how market prices are established by the intersection of supply and demand curves.
E: Marginalism is the theory that all units in production have equal value.
F: Marginalism is the practice of increasing production by one unit to assess cost changes.
G: Marginalism is the concept that the value of a good is determined by its historical cost.
H: Marginalism is the method of analysis that concentrates attention on the last unit in production or consumption.
I: Marginalism is the method of analysis that ignores the last unit in production or consumption.
J: Marginalism is the economic principle that prioritizes the most abundant resources.

Okay, so I have this question about marginalism in economics, and I need to choose the correct definition from the options given. Hmm, I remember that marginalism has something to do with analyzing the additional unit or the margin, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Let me think. I think marginalism is a theory or method that looks at the effect of adding one more unit. Like, when a company produces one more product, how does that affect their costs or benefits. Oh wait, I think it's more about the incremental change rather than the total. So it's not about the whole production but the margin, the last unit.

Wait, wasn't there something about marginal utility? Oh right, in economics, marginal utility is the additional satisfaction a consumer gets from consuming one more unit of a good. So marginalism in that context would focus on the last unit consumed. So the method assesses how each additional unit affects satisfaction or costs.

Looking at the options now. Option B says it's about the impact of changes in production volume on total satisfaction. That sounds close, but the wording is a bit off. Option H says it concentrates on the last unit in production or consumption. That aligns with what I remember about marginal analysis focusing on the margin, the last unit.

Option F talks about increasing production by one unit to assess cost changes. That's more about marginal cost specifically, not the broader concept of marginalism. Option C is about the first unit, which doesn't seem right. Option D is about supply and demand curves intersecting to set prices. That's more about market equilibrium, not marginalism.

Option E says all units have equal value, which doesn't make sense because marginalism is about the difference the last unit makes. Option G refers to historical cost, which I think is more related to Marxist theories or something else. Option I ignores the last unit, which is the opposite of what marginalism does. Option J is about abundant resources, which I don't think is related.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be H. Because marginalism focuses on the last unit in production or consumption to understand the impact of incremental changes.

The correct answer is H. Marginalism focuses on the last unit in production or consumption to assess incremental changes.

Answer: H
