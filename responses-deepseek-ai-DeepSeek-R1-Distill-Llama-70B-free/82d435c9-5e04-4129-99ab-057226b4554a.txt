Question:

A homeowner wished to have his house painted. He contacted a number of house painters in his area and asked them to submit bids to do the work. The homeowner received 10 bids. The first nine offered to paint the house for amounts ranging from $10,000 to $12,500. The 10th bid was sent by telegram and was supposed to be for $10,000. However, the telegraph company made a mistake and transmitted the bid as $1,000. The homeowner immediately accepted the 1 0th bid, but the 1 0 painter refused to perform. The I 0th painter's best defense in an action for breach of contract by the homeowner would be

Options:

A: that the homeowner should have been aware of the mistaken transmission, because of the disparity between its bid and the others.
B: that the telegraph company should be liable as an independent contractor.
C: that the homeowner deliberately exploited the telegraph company's mistake.
D: that the telegraph company's mistake nullifies the contractual agreement.
E: that the homeowner's immediate acceptance of the bid was unreasonable.
F: that the discrepancy between the bid and the actual cost of painting is too large.
G: that the homeowner was under an affirmative duty to investigate all submitted bids.
H: that the bid was not legally binding as it was sent via telegram.
I: that the homeowner failed to provide accurate specifications for the job.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand the scenario.

A homeowner wants his house painted and contacts several painters. He gets ten bids. The first nine are between $10k and $12.5k. The tenth bid was meant to be $10k but due to a telegraph mistake, it was sent as $1k. The homeowner accepted the tenth bid, but the painter refused to do the work. Now, the painter is being sued for breach of contract, and we need to find their best defense.

Hmm, so the core issue here is about contract formation and mistake. From what I remember, for a contract to be valid, there needs to be offer, acceptance, and consideration, and both parties must have the capacity to enter into the contract. But mistakes can sometimes void a contract.

In this case, the painter's bid was a mistake. They intended to offer $10k, but it was sent as $1k. The homeowner accepted it as $1k. So, the question is whether a binding contract was formed.

I think about the concept of unilateral mistake. If one party makes a mistake and the other knows about it, then the contract might not be enforceable. But if the non-mistaken party doesn't know and the mistake is so obvious that a reasonable person would notice, maybe the contract can be avoided.

Wait, but in this case, the homeowner received nine bids around $10k to $12.5k, and then a tenth bid of $1k. That's a big difference. So, perhaps a reasonable person would notice that $1k is way too low compared to the others. So maybe the homeowner should have realized it was a mistake.

So, the painter's defense would be that there was a mistake, and the homeowner either knew or should have known about it. That would make the contract voidable or void.

Looking at the options:

Option A: That the homeowner should have been aware of the mistaken transmission because of the disparity between its bid and the others. This seems to align with what I was thinking. The big difference in price should have made the homeowner suspicious.

Option B: Telegraph company liable as an independent contractor. I don't think that's the best defense here because the issue is between the homeowner and painter, not involving the telegraph company's liability to the painter.

Option C: Homeowner deliberately exploited the mistake. If the homeowner knew, that's different, but the question is about the best defense, and the option is about deliberate exploitation. Maybe, but I think A is stronger because it's about whether the homeowner should have known.

Option D: Telegraph mistake nullifies contract. That's a possible argument, but I think the legal principle is more about whether the mistake was known or should have been known.

Option E: Homeowner's immediate acceptance was unreasonable. Maybe, but I think the bigger point is the disparity in the bid, which makes A better.

Option F: Discrepancy between bid and actual cost. But the question doesn't mention what the actual cost is. It's about the bids received.

Option G: Homeowner had a duty to investigate. I'm not sure if that's a standard legal duty. It might tie into A, though.

Option H: Bid not binding because sent via telegram. Telegrams can be binding; the medium doesn't usually invalidate a contract.

Option I: Homeowner failed to provide accurate specs. The question doesn't mention anything about the specs being wrong, so this seems irrelevant.

So, the best defense is probably A, arguing that the homeowner should have been aware because of the big price difference. This would mean the contract isn't enforceable because of the unilateral mistake that the homeowner should have noticed.

The question revolves around contract law, specifically the issue of mistake in contract formation. The homeowner received ten bids for painting his house, with nine ranging from $10,000 to $12,500 and the tenth mistakenly transmitted as $1,000 due to a telegraph error. The homeowner accepted the $1,000 bid, but the painter refused to perform. The painter's best defense would focus on the principles of unilateral mistake and whether the homeowner should have recognized the error.

For a contract to be enforceable, both parties must have a mutual understanding of the terms. If one party makes a mistake and the other party knows or should have known about the mistake, the contract may be voidable or void. In this case, the $1,000 bid was significantly lower than the other bids, which ranged between $10,000 and $12,500. This substantial disparity should have alerted the homeowner to the possibility of a mistake, making it unreasonable for them to accept the bid without further investigation.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: This is the strongest defense. The significant difference between the $1,000 bid and the other bids should have put the homeowner on notice that a mistake might have occurred. This aligns with the legal principle that a party should not be allowed to exploit an obvious mistake.
- **Option B**: While the telegraph company could be liable for the error, this does not directly address the issue of whether a binding contract was formed between the homeowner and the painter.
- **Option C**: There is no evidence in the scenario to suggest that the homeowner deliberately exploited the mistake, making this less relevant.
- **Option D**: The telegraph company's mistake does not automatically nullify the contract; the key issue is whether the homeowner should have been aware of the mistake.
- **Option E**: While the homeowner's immediate acceptance might seem unreasonable, the stronger argument is based on the disparity in the bids.
- **Option F**: The actual cost of painting is irrelevant to the issue at hand.
- **Option G**: There is no clear legal duty for the homeowner to investigate bids in this context.
- **Option H**: Telegrams can be a valid medium for forming contracts, so this is not a strong defense.
- **Option I**: The question does not mention any issues with the job specifications, making this irrelevant.

The best defense is **Option A**, as it highlights the homeowner's responsibility to recognize the obvious mistake due to the significant disparity in the bids.
