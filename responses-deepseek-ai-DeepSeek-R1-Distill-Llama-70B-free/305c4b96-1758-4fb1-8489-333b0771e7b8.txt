Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that 0.20 grams of cuttings from a silver coin, which contains copper, were dissolved in nitric acid. Then, a sodium chloride solution was added to precipitate silver chloride. The collected and dried AgCl weighed 0.2152 grams. The question is asking for the percentage of silver in the coin. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, so I remember that when you have a mixture and you want to find the percentage of a particular element, you often use precipitation reactions. Silver nitrate reacting with sodium chloride to form silver chloride precipitate is a common method. So the idea is that all the silver in the coin ends up as AgCl, and from the mass of AgCl, we can find out how much silver was present initially.

Let me write down what I know:

Mass of coin sample = 0.20 grams
Mass of AgCl precipitate = 0.2152 grams

I think the approach here is to find the moles of AgCl, then find the moles of Ag in that, and then convert that back to grams of Ag. Finally, calculate the percentage of Ag in the original sample.

Wait, right. Because AgCl is a 1:1 ratio of Ag to Cl. So the moles of Ag would be equal to the moles of AgCl.

First, I need the molar masses.

Silver (Ag) has an atomic weight of about 107.87 g/mol.
Chlorine (Cl) is about 35.45 g/mol.
So AgCl's molar mass is 107.87 + 35.45 = 143.32 g/mol.

Okay, so moles of AgCl would be mass divided by molar mass.

Moles AgCl = 0.2152 g / 143.32 g/mol.

Let me calculate that. Hmm, 0.2152 divided by 143.32. Let's see, 143.32 is approximately 143. So 0.2152 / 143.32. Let me approximate that.

Wait, let me do it more accurately. 143.32 times 0.0015 is 0.215, because 143.32 * 0.001 = 0.14332, 143.32 *0.0005=0.07166. Adding 0.14332 + 0.07166 = 0.21498, which is about 0.215. So 0.0015 moles of AgCl.

So moles of Ag is the same as moles of AgCl, which is 0.0015 mol.

Now, the mass of Ag in the sample would be moles * molar mass.

Mass Ag = 0.0015 mol * 107.87 g/mol.

Let me compute that. 0.0015 * 107.87. Hmm, 0.001 * 107.87 is 0.10787. 0.0005 * 107.87 is 0.053935. So 0.10787 + 0.053935 = 0.161805 grams.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, 0.0015 * 107.87 = ?

Well, 0.001 * 107.87 is 0.10787.

0.0005 * 107.87 is 0.053935.

Adding them gives 0.161805 grams of Ag.

So the sample was 0.20 grams, and the Ag in it was approximately 0.161805 grams.

To find the percentage, (mass of Ag / mass of sample) * 100.

So that's (0.161805 / 0.20) * 100.

0.161805 divided by 0.2 is 0.809. Multiply by 100 gives 80.9%.

Looking at the options, option F is 81%, which is close. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because the numbers could be a bit off.

Wait, let me re-calculate the moles of AgCl more accurately.

Molar mass of AgCl is 143.32 g/mol.

Moles = 0.2152 g / 143.32 g/mol.

Let me compute that.

143.32 times 0.0015 is 0.215, as I had before. So 0.2152 /143.32 = 0.0015004 moles.

So moles of Ag is 0.0015004.

Mass of Ag is 0.0015004 * 107.87.

Let me calculate that.

0.0015004 * 100 = 0.15004
0.0015004 *7.87= ?

Wait, 0.0015004 * 7 = 0.010503
0.0015004 *0.87= approximately 0.001304.

So 0.010503 + 0.001304 = 0.011807.

So total is 0.15004 + 0.011807 = 0.161847 grams.

So 0.161847 grams of Ag in 0.20 grams of sample.

Percentage = (0.161847 / 0.20) *100.

0.161847 / 0.2 = 0.809235. Multiply by 100 gives 80.9235%, which is approximately 80.92%.

Looking back at the options, option F is 81%, which is the closest. But wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:87%
B:85%
C:65%
D:88%
E:92%
F:81%
G:72%
H:75%
I:78%
J:90%

So 80.92% is closest to 81%, which is option F.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make any mistakes in the calculations? Because the AgCl is 0.2152g. Let me make sure that the molar masses are correct.

Ag is about 107.87 g/mol, Cl is 35.45 g/mol, so AgCl is 107.87 +35.45 = 143.32 g/mol.

Yes, that's correct.

So moles of AgCl: 0.2152 /143.32 = approx 0.0015004 mol.

Mass of Ag is 0.0015004 *107.87 = approx 0.1618 g.

Percentage is (0.1618 / 0.20) *100 = 80.9%, which rounds to 81%.

So the correct answer should be F:81%.

Wait, but another thought. The problem says the sample is from a silver coin containing Cu, so the rest is copper. So the total is Ag plus Cu equals 0.20g. So my calculation seems correct because I only considered Ag.

I think I'm confident that the answer is F:81%.

To determine the percentage of silver (Ag) in the coin, we start by analyzing the data provided:

- **Mass of the coin sample**: 0.20 g  
- **Mass of AgCl precipitate**: 0.2152 g  

The reaction involves the formation of AgCl from Ag in the coin. Since the molar ratio of Ag to AgCl is 1:1, the moles of Ag in the coin are equal to the moles of AgCl formed.

### Step 1: Calculate the molar mass of AgCl  
The molar mass of AgCl is:  
\[
\text{Molar mass of AgCl} = \text{Atomic mass of Ag} + \text{Atomic mass of Cl} = 107.87 + 35.45 = 143.32 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the moles of AgCl  
Using the mass of AgCl precipitate:  
\[
\text{Moles of AgCl} = \frac{\text{Mass of AgCl}}{\text{Molar mass of AgCl}} = \frac{0.2152}{143.32} \approx 0.0015004 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the mass of Ag in the coin  
Since the moles of Ag are equal to the moles of AgCl, the mass of Ag is:  
\[
\text{Mass of Ag} = \text{Moles of Ag} \times \text{Molar mass of Ag} = 0.0015004 \times 107.87 \approx 0.1618 \, \text{g}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of Ag in the coin  
The percentage of Ag in the coin is:  
\[
\text{Percentage of Ag} = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of Ag}}{\text{Mass of coin sample}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.1618}{0.20} \right) \times 100 \approx 80.9\%.
\]

### Step 5: Match the closest option  
The calculated percentage of Ag is approximately 80.9%, which rounds to 81%. Among the given options, the closest match is **F: 81%**.
