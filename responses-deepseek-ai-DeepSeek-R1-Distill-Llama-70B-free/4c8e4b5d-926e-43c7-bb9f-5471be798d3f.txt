Okay, so I'm trying to solve this series motor problem. Hmm, series motor, right. Let me think about what I know. Series motors have their armature and field windings connected in series, so the same current flows through both. The torque is proportional to the square of the current, and speed depends on voltage, flux, and armature resistance. 

The question gives me some data. So the motor is 25 hp, 240 volts. It takes 93 amps when running at 800 rpm under rated load. Armature resistance is 0.12 ohms, series-field resistance is 0.08 ohms. Then the load is reduced, and the current drops to 31 amps. I need to find the new speed.

Wait, the question also mentions that the flux is reduced by 50% for a current drop of 66 2/3 percent. Oh, right, flux is proportional to the current in a series motor, so when the current decreases, the flux decreases proportionally. So if current drops by 2/3 (66.666...%), the flux drops by 50%? Wait, that seems a bit conflicting. Let me see. Oh wait, the question says "the flux is reduced by 50 percent for a current drop of 66 2/3 percent." So when the current drops by 66.666% (which is 2/3), the flux drops by 50%. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Oh, no, maybe it's a way to say that flux is proportional to current, but the relationship isn't linear in this case. Or perhaps it's because of the way the field is set up. Hmm, maybe I should just take it as given that when the current drops by 2/3, the flux is half. So I= I1, flux is Φ1. When current drops to I2 = I1 - (2/3 I1) = (1/3 I1), then flux is 0.5 Φ1.

Wait, but the initial current is 93 A, and the new current is 31 A. Let me calculate what the current drop is. 93 to 31 is a drop of 62 A. (93-31=62). 62/93 is about 0.666, so 66.66% drop. So that's exactly the 66 2/3% drop. So then the flux would drop by 50%, so Φ2 = 0.5 Φ1.

Wait, but wait, the current is decreasing from 93 to 31, which is a decrease of about 66.66%, so the flux would be half as per the problem statement.

So now, I need to find the new speed. The initial condition is full load, the second is partial load with lower current.

First, let me recall the speed equation for a DC motor. The speed n is given by:

n = (V - Ia Ra) / (k Φ)

Where V is the applied voltage, Ia is armature current, Ra is armature resistance, and k is a constant that includes the field flux and other motor parameters.

Wait, but in a series motor, the field resistance is in series with the armature, so the total resistance is Ra + Rsh (if it's a shunt, but here it's series). Oh wait, no, series motor has field and armature in series. So the total resistance is Ra + Rf. So when the motor is running, the voltage applied is V = I (Ra + Rf) + brush drop + back EMF.

Wait, also, the brush drop is given as 2 volts at both loads. So that's a fixed voltage drop.

So let's model the initial condition first. At full load, I1 = 93 A.

The back EMF at initial condition, E_b1 = V - I1(Ra + Rf) - brush drop.

So V is 240 volts.

So E_b1 = 240 - 93*(0.12 + 0.08) - 2.

Let me compute that. 0.12 + 0.08 is 0.20 ohms.

93 * 0.20 = 18.6 volts. Then 240 - 18.6 = 221.4, minus 2 volts brush drop gives 219.4 volts. So E_b1 = 219.4 V.

But E_b is also equal to k * Φ1 * n1, where n1 is speed in rpm. Wait, but k is a constant that includes the number of conductors, poles, etc. However, for the same motor, k would remain the same if the number of poles doesn't change, which I think we can assume.

So E_b1 = k Φ1 n1.

Now, at the second condition, current I2 is 31 A. Since the current is lower, the flux is 0.5 Φ1. Let me compute the new back EMF E_b2.

But wait, E_b2 = V - I2(Ra + Rf) - brush drop.

So that's 240 - 31*(0.20) - 2.

31 * 0.20 is 6.2. So 240 -6.2 = 233.8. Minus 2 is 231.8 V.

So E_b2 = 231.8 V.

But E_b2 is also equal to k * Φ2 * n2.

Since Φ2 = 0.5 Φ1, then E_b2 = k * 0.5 Φ1 * n2.

But from E_b1, we have k Φ1 = E_b1 / n1 = 219.4 / 800.

So substituting into E_b2:

E_b2 = 0.5 * (E_b1 / n1) * n2.

Plugging in E_b2 = 231.8 V, E_b1=219.4, n1=800:

231.8 = 0.5 * (219.4 / 800) * n2.

Let me compute 219.4 /800 first. 219.4 ÷ 800 ≈ 0.27425.

Multiply by 0.5: 0.27425 * 0.5 = 0.137125.

So 231.8 = 0.137125 * n2.

Solving for n2: n2 = 231.8 / 0.137125 ≈ let me compute that.

Let me do the division: 231.8 ÷ 0.137125.

Hmm, 0.137125 times 1700 is 0.137125 *1700=232. 7125.

Wait, 0.137125 * 1700: 0.137125 * 1000 is 137.125, 0.137125*700=96. So total 137.125+96=233.125. Oh, but I have 231.8, which is a bit less than 233.125.

So 0.137125 * 1690 ≈ Let's see: 0.137125 * 1690.

0.137125 *1600 = 219.4, 0.137125*90=12.34 approx. So total 219.4 +12.34=231.74. Which is very close to 231.8.

So n2≈1690 rpm. Looking at the options, option I is 1690 rpm.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because sometimes rounding can cause errors.

E_b1: 240 -93*(0.12+0.08)=93*0.2=18.6 → 240-18.6=221.4, minus 2 gives 219.4 V.

E_b2: 240 -31*(0.2)=6.2 → 240-6.2=233.8, minus 2 → 231.8 V.

E_b2 = (k * Φ1 * n1 ) * (Φ2/Φ1) * (n2/n1) )

Wait, no, because E_b2 = k Φ2 n2.

And since Φ2 = 0.5 Φ1,

E_b2 = k * (0.5 Φ1) *n2 = 0.5 * (k Φ1) *n2.

But from E_b1, k Φ1 = E_b1 / n1.

So E_b2 = 0.5 * (E_b1 /n1 ) *n2.

Which gives n2= (2 E_b2 n1 ) / E_b1.

Plugging in the numbers:

E_b1=219.4, E_b2=231.8, n1=800.

n2 = (2 * 231.8 * 800) / 219.4.

Compute numerator: 2 *231.8=463.6 → 463.6 *800=370,880.

Denominator: 219.4.

So 370880 / 219.4 ≈ let me calculate.

219.4 * 1690 = ?

Well, 200 *1690= 338,000.

19.4 *1690: 19*1690=32,110, 0.4*1690=676 → total 32,786.

So 338,000 +32,786=370,786. That's very close to 370,880. The difference is 94. So 1690 + (94/219.4)≈ 1690 + ~0.43 ≈ 1690.43 rpm.

So approximately 1690 rpm, which is option I.

To solve the problem, we analyze the series motor's behavior under two operating conditions: full load and reduced load. The motor parameters and given data are as follows:

- **Rated voltage (V):** 240 V  
- **Full-load current (I₁):** 93 A  
- **Reduced-load current (I₂):** 31 A  
- **Armature resistance (Rₐ):** 0.12 Ω  
- **Field resistance (Rₛ):** 0.08 Ω  
- **Total resistance (Rₜ):** Rₐ + Rₛ = 0.20 Ω  
- **Brush drop:** 2 V (constant for both loads)  
- **Initial speed (n₁):** 800 rpm  
- **Flux relationship:** Flux reduces by 50% when current decreases by 66.67%.  

### Step 1: Back EMF at Full Load
The back EMF at full load is calculated using the formula:  
\[
E_{b1} = V - I₁ Rₜ - \text{brush drop}
\]
Substituting values:  
\[
E_{b1} = 240 - (93)(0.20) - 2 = 240 - 18.6 - 2 = 219.4 \, \text{V}
\]

### Step 2: Back EMF at Reduced Load
Similarly, the back EMF at reduced load is:  
\[
E_{b2} = V - I₂ Rₜ - \text{brush drop}
\]
Substituting values:  
\[
E_{b2} = 240 - (31)(0.20) - 2 = 240 - 6.2 - 2 = 231.8 \, \text{V}
\]

### Step 3: Speed Equation for a Series Motor
The speed of a series motor is given by:  
\[
n = \frac{E_b}{k \Phi}
\]
where \(k\) is a constant and \(\Phi\) is the flux. Since flux is proportional to current in a series motor, and the flux is reduced by 50% when the current decreases by 66.67%, we have:  
\[
\Phi_2 = 0.5 \Phi_1
\]

From the speed equation, the ratio of speeds can be expressed as:  
\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{E_{b2} \Phi_1}{E_{b1} \Phi_2}
\]
Substituting \(\Phi_2 = 0.5 \Phi_1\):  
\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{E_{b2} \Phi_1}{E_{b1} (0.5 \Phi_1)} = \frac{2 E_{b2}}{E_{b1}}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the New Speed
Substituting \(E_{b1} = 219.4 \, \text{V}\), \(E_{b2} = 231.8 \, \text{V}\), and \(n_1 = 800 \, \text{rpm}\):  
\[
n_2 = n_1 \cdot \frac{2 E_{b2}}{E_{b1}}
\]
\[
n_2 = 800 \cdot \frac{2 (231.8)}{219.4}
\]
\[
n_2 = 800 \cdot \frac{463.6}{219.4} \approx 800 \cdot 2.111 \approx 1690 \, \text{rpm}
\]

### Final Answer
The motor operates at approximately **1690 rpm** when the load is reduced. The closest option is **I: 1,690 rpm**.
