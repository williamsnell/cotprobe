Okay, so I've got this problem here where there are five resistors connected in parallel, and I need to find the total resistance. Hmm, I remember that when resistors are in parallel, the formula for the total resistance is different from when they're in series.

Wait, right, in series, resistances just add up. But in parallel, it's the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals. So the formula is 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... + 1/Rn. Oh right, that's it.

The resistors given are 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 ohms. So I need to calculate 1/10 + 1/15 + 1/20 + 1/25 + 1/30, and then take the reciprocal of that sum to get the total resistance.

Let me break it down step by step. First, find each reciprocal:

1/10 is 0.1,
1/15 is approximately 0.066666...,
1/20 is 0.05,
1/25 is 0.04,
and 1/30 is about 0.033333...

Now add all these together. Let me write them out:

0.1 + 0.066666... + 0.05 + 0.04 + 0.033333...

Let me add them one by one. Start with 0.1 and 0.066666... That adds up to 0.166666... Then add 0.05: 0.216666... Next, add 0.04: becomes 0.256666... Finally, add 0.033333..., which brings it to 0.29 (approximately). Wait, let me check that.

Wait, 0.1 + 0.066666 is 0.166666. Adding 0.05 makes it 0.216666. Adding 0.04: 0.256666. Adding 0.033333: 0.290000... Oh wait, exactly 0.29? Hmm, wait, let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.1 is 3/30, 0.066666 is 2/30, 0.05 is 1.5/30, 0.04 is 1.2/30, and 0.033333 is 1/30. Wait, maybe it's better to find a common denominator.

Alternatively, let's compute each term as fractions to avoid decimal approximations.

So 1/10 is 1/10, 1/15 is 1/15, 1/20 is 1/20, 1/25 is 1/25, 1/30 is 1/30.

To add these, I need a common denominator. Let's see, what's the least common multiple (LCM) of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Let's think: factors are 2, 3, 5. The highest exponents are 2^2 (from 20=2^2*5), 3^1 (from 15 and 30), and 5^2 (from 25=5^2). So LCM is 4 * 3 * 25 = 300.

So each fraction converted to denominator 300:

1/10 = 30/300,
1/15 = 20/300,
1/20 = 15/300,
1/25 = 12/300,
1/30 = 10/300.

Adding all numerators: 30 + 20 = 50, plus 15 is 65, plus 12 is 77, plus 10 is 87. So total is 87/300.

Wait, 30+20=50, plus 15 is 65, +12=77, +10=87. So sum is 87/300.

Wait, but 87/300 simplifies to 29/100 because 87 divided by 3 is 29, 300 divided by 3 is 100. So 29/100 is 0.29. So the reciprocal is 100/29, which is approximately 3.448... Oh wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

Wait, 100 divided by 29: 29*3=87, so 3 with remainder 13, which is 3.448 approximately. So the total resistance R_total is 100/29 ≈ 3.448 ohms.

Looking at the options, option A is 3.46 ohms, which is pretty close. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the sum.

Wait, let me double-check the sum: 1/10 + 1/15 + 1/20 +1/25 +1/30.

Another approach: Let's compute each term as a decimal more accurately.

1/10 = 0.1
1/15 ≈ 0.0666667
1/20 = 0.05
1/25 = 0.04
1/30 ≈ 0.0333333

Adding them up:

0.1 + 0.0666667 = 0.1666667

0.1666667 + 0.05 = 0.2166667

0.2166667 + 0.04 = 0.2566667

0.2566667 + 0.0333333 = 0.29 exactly.

So 1/R_total = 0.29, so R_total = 1 / 0.29 ≈ 3.4482759 ohms.

Looking at the options, option A is 3.46, which is very close. But wait, perhaps I should calculate 1/0.29 more accurately.

Let me compute 1 ÷ 0.29:

0.29 * 3 = 0.87 → 3 → 3.0
0.29 * 3.4 = 0.29*(3 + 0.4) = 0.87 + 0.116 = 0.986 → 3.4 → 0.986 is less than 1, so 3.4 gives 0.986, so 3.45 * 0.29 = ?

Wait, better to do long division: 1 ÷ 0.29.

Let me write it as 1.00 divided by 0.29.

0.29 goes into 1.00 three times (3*0.29=0.87). Subtract 0.87 from 1.00: 0.13.

Bring down a zero: 0.130.

0.29 goes into 0.130 four times (4*0.29=1.16, which is too much), so 4 is too high. 3 times: 0.87, but wait, no, 0.29 * 4 is 1.16, which is larger than 0.130. So try 4? Wait, 0.29 * 4 is 1.16, which is bigger than 0.130.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think of 0.29 as 29/100, so 1/(29/100) is 100/29. So 100 divided by 29.

29*3=87, remainder 13.

Bring down a zero: 130.

29*4=116 → 4, remainder 14.

Bring down next zero: 140.

29*4=116 → 4, remainder 24.

Bring down zero: 240.

29*8=232 → 8, remainder 8.

Bring down zero: 80.

29*2=58 → 2, remainder 22.

Bring down zero: 220.

29*7=203 →7, remainder 17.

Bring down zero: 170.

29*5=145 →5, rem 25.

Bring down zero: 250.

29*8=232 →8, rem 18.

Hmm, so the decimal is 3.44827586... so approximately 3.448, which is 3.45 when rounded to two decimal places. But looking at the options, option A is 3.46. Wait, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recheck the sum of the reciprocals.

Wait, 1/10 is 0.1, 1/15 is approximately 0.0666667, 1/20 is 0.05, 1/25 is 0.04, and 1/30 is approximately 0.0333333.

Adding them: 0.1 + 0.0666667 = 0.1666667

Plus 0.05 gives 0.2166667

Plus 0.04 gives 0.2566667

Plus 0.0333333: 0.2566667 + 0.0333333 = 0.29 exactly.

So 1/R_total = 0.29 → R_total ≈ 3.448.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 3.46, but perhaps there's a more precise option. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 3.46 ohms

Other options: B is 4.56, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the reciprocal. Wait, 100/29 is approximately 3.448, which is closer to 3.45 than 3.46. But none of the options is 3.45. The closest is A:3.46.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the sum of the reciprocals. Maybe I missed something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each term more accurately as fractions.

Wait, let's compute the sum as fractions without converting to decimals.

The sum is 1/10 + 1/15 + 1/20 + 1/25 + 1/30.

Let me find a common denominator. The denominators are 10,15,20,25,30.

Prime factors:

10: 2*5

15:3*5

20:2²*5

25:5²

30:2*3*5

The LCM is the product of the highest powers: 2² (from 20), 3^1 (from 15 and 30), and 5² (from 25). So LCM is 4*3*25=300.

So each term becomes:

1/10 = 30/300

1/15 = 20/300

1/20 = 15/300

1/25 = 12/300

1/30 = 10/300

Adding all numerators: 30 +20 =50; +15=65; +12=77; +10=87. So sum is 87/300.

Simplify 87/300: both divided by 3 → 29/100. So 29/100 = 0.29.

So 1/R_total = 29/100 → R_total = 100/29 ≈ 3.448... So approximately 3.45 ohms.

Looking back at the options, option A is 3.46, which is the closest. So the answer should be A.

To calculate the total resistance of five resistors (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 ohms) connected in parallel, we use the formula for parallel resistance:

\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \frac{1}{R_4} + \frac{1}{R_5}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the reciprocals of each resistance
\[
\frac{1}{10} = 0.1, \quad \frac{1}{15} \approx 0.06667, \quad \frac{1}{20} = 0.05, \quad \frac{1}{25} = 0.04, \quad \frac{1}{30} \approx 0.03333
\]

### Step 2: Sum the reciprocals
\[
0.1 + 0.06667 + 0.05 + 0.04 + 0.03333 = 0.29
\]

### Step 3: Take the reciprocal of the sum to find \( R_{\text{total}} \)
\[
R_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{0.29} \approx 3.448 \, \Omega
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The closest value to \( 3.448 \, \Omega \) among the given options is **3.46 ohms**.

### Final Answer:
**A: 3.46 ohms**
