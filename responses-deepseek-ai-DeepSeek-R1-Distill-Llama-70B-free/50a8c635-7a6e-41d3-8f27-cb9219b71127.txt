Okay, so I've got this question about pilocarpine and its effects on different body systems. Hmm, I remember that pilocarpine is a cholinergic drug, right? Which means it acts on the parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic system is responsible for promoting digestion, reducing heart rate, and causing pupil constriction, among other things.

The question asks about three specific effects: the digestive tract, the iris of the eye, and the heart rate. Let me break each one down.

Starting with the digestive tract. The parasympathetic nervous system generally increases digestive processes. So when pilocarpine stimulates the parasympathetic nerves, it should facilitate digestion. That would mean more activity, like increased secretion of digestive enzymes and maybe better movement through the intestines. So looking at the options, any choice that says (a) facilitates digestion is a contender.

Next, the iris of the eye. The parasympathetic system causes the constriction of the pupils. So when the parasympathetic nerves are stimulated, the pupils get smaller. So effect (b) should be pupil size reduction. So options that have (b) reduces pupil size are correct so far.

Now the heart rate. The parasympathetic nervous system, when activated, decreases heart rate. It does this through the vagus nerve. So if pilocarpine is a parasympathomimetic drug, it should slow down the heart rate and maybe weaken the contractions. So effect (c) would be slowing and weakening the heartbeat.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: (a) Facilitates digestion, (b) Reduces pupil size, (c) Slows and weakens heartbeat. That fits all three points I thought of.

Option B: (a) No effect on digestion—no, because parasympathetic does affect digestion. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: (a) Slows digestion—wait, no. I thought parasympathetic increases digestion. So C's (a) is wrong.

Option D: (b) increases pupil size—no, that's the opposite. So D is out.

Option E: (a) inhibits digestion; again, opposite. So E is wrong.

Option F: (a) slows digestion. No, earlier I thought it's increased. So F is wrong.

Option G: (a) no effect on digestion. No, parasympathetic definitely affects it. So G is out.

Option H: (a) inhibits digestion. No, so H is wrong.

Option I: (a) facilitates digestion, which is correct. (b) no effect on pupil. Wait, no, we expect pupil constriction. So I's (b) is wrong. So I is out.

Option J: (a) inhibits digestion. No, so J is wrong.

So the only option that fits all three correctly is option A.

Pilocarpine is a cholinergic drug that stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic system promotes digestion, reduces heart rate, and causes pupil constriction. 

- **Effect on the digestive tract**: Pilocarpine facilitates digestion by increasing digestive enzyme secretion and intestinal activity. 
- **Effect on the iris of the eye**: Pilocarpine reduces pupil size due to parasympathetic-induced constriction.
- **Effect on heart rate**: Pilocarpine slows and weakens the heartbeat by activating the vagus nerve, which decreases heart rate.

Among the options, only **A** correctly states all three effects: (a) facilitates digestion, (b) reduces pupil size, and (c) slows and weakens the heartbeat.

Answer: A
