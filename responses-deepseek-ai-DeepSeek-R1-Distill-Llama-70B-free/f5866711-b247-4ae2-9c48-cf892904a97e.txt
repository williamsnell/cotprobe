Question:

A state's constitution reserves to the people of each municipality in the state the power of referendum with respect to all questions that the municipality is authorized to control by legislation. A real estate developer applied for a zoning change to permit construction of a water park on land he owned in a city within the state. While the application was pending, the city's charter was amended by popular vote so as to require that any changes in land use agreed to by the city council be approved by a 55% vote in a referendum. The city planning commission and the city council both approved the proposed zoning change. However, the commission rejected the developer's subsequent application for "recreational area" approval for the proposed water park on the grounds that the council's rezoning action had not been submitted to a referendum. Assume that while the action was pending in the state court, the proposed zoning change was defeated in a referendum. Which would be the most applicable rule of constitutional law with respect to the referendum procedure when applied to a rezoning ordinance?

Options:

A: The referendum procedure is violative of the due process clause of the FourteenthAmendment.
B: The referendum procedure is arbitrary and capricious and thus should be held invalid as an unlawful delegation of legislative power.
C: The referendum procedure is not applicable in this context as it is only for state-wide legislation.
D: The referendum procedure as a basic instrument of the democratic process does not violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
E: The referendum procedure is a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
F: The referendum procedure is valid only if it is not influenced by external factors.
G: The referendum procedure is unconstitutional as it infringes on the rights of property owners.
H: The referendum procedure is only applicable in cases of major legislative changes, not zoning changes.
I: The referendum procedure in this context is invalid as against publicpolicy.

Okay, so I have this question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with referendum procedures and their applicability to rezoning ordinances. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The setup is that a state's constitution gives municipalities the power of referendum for questions they can control through legislation. A real estate developer wants to build a water park and applies for a zoning change. While the application is pending, the city's charter is amended by a popular vote. This amendment requires that any changes in land use agreed to by the city council must be approved by a 55% vote in a referendum.

So the planning commission and city council approved the zoning change, but then the commission rejected the developer's application for "recreational area" approval because the council's action hadn't been submitted to a referendum. Later, while the case was in court, the proposed zoning change was defeated in a referendum.

The question is about the constitutional rule regarding the referendum procedure applied to a rezoning ordinance. The options are from A to I, each presenting a different legal principle.

First, I need to recall what the law says about referendums and zoning changes. I remember that referendums are a form of direct democracy where the people vote on specific issues. They're generally constitutional as an exercise of the people's power. But there might be limitations, especially regarding due process or equal protection.

The key here is whether requiring a referendum for rezoning violates any constitutional clauses. Let me think about each option.

Option A says the referendum violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. I'm not sure about this. Due process usually relates to fair procedures, but a referendum is a legislative process, so maybe it's allowed.

Option B claims it's arbitrary and capricious, an unlawful delegation. But the delegation here is from the city to the people, which is a form of direct legislation, which is typically permissible unless it violates some constitutional provision.

Option C argues the referendum isn't applicable here because it's only for state-wide legislation. But the question says the state constitution gives municipalities the power, so it's local, not state-wide. So C seems incorrect.

Option D states that the referendum doesn't violate due process as it's part of democracy. That sounds plausible. The Supreme Court has generally upheld referendums unless they infringe on fundamental rights without a compelling reason.

Option E suggests an equal protection violation. Equal protection would be an issue if the referendum treated people differently without a rational basis. But rezoning affecting property owners might not inherently violate equal protection unless it's targeting a specific group, which isn't indicated here.

Option F says it's only valid if not influenced by external factors. That's too vague. All referendums can be influenced by various factors, so this seems unlikely to be the right choice.

Option G argues it's unconstitutional because it infringes on property owners' rights. Property rights are important, but zoning laws and referendums are common. The developer still has avenues to challenge, but the referendum itself isn't a taking without due process unless it's arbitrary.

Option H says the referendum is only applicable for major legislative changes, not zoning. But zoning is a legislative function, so this might not hold. It's possible that referendums can apply to zoning changes unless the constitution limits it.

Option I claims it's against public policy. That's a bit broad. Courts usually don't invalidate procedures just because they're against public policy unless there's a specific constitutional violation.

Now, thinking about relevant case law. I recall that the Supreme Court has upheld the use of referendums in the context of zoning and land use. For example, in a case where a city's referendum reversed a zoning decision, the court found that the referendum process was a legitimate exercise of the people's power and didn't violate due process. The idea is that the people have the right to decide such issues through direct democracy, as long as it's not infringing on fundamental rights without a rational basis.

So in this scenario, the referendum procedure is a basic democratic tool. The fact that the zoning change was defeated in a referendum doesn't raise a due process issue because the process itself is a legitimate exercise of the people's authority. Therefore, the correct answer would be D: The referendum procedure as a basic instrument of democratic process does not violate the due process clause.

I should double-check if there are any exceptions. For example, if the referendum targeted a specific individual or group unfairly, but here it's a general zoning change, so it's broad and applies to all similar situations. Thus, D seems correct.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of a referendum procedure applied to a rezoning ordinance. The state constitution allows municipalities to use referendums for questions they can control through legislation. After a city charter amendment required land use changes to be approved by a 55% referendum vote, a zoning change for a water park was defeated in a referendum. The issue is whether this referendum procedure violates constitutional principles.

- **Option A**: The due process clause is not violated because the referendum is a legitimate legislative process.
- **Option B**: The referendum is not arbitrary or capricious; it is a valid delegation of power to the people.
- **Option C**: The referendum is applicable locally, not just state-wide, as the state constitution allows municipal referendums.
- **Option D**: Referendums are a fundamental democratic tool and do not violate due process, making this the most applicable rule.
- **Option E**: No equal protection violation is evident, as the referendum does not target a specific group.
- **Option F**: Referendums are inherently influenced by various factors, so this option is too vague.
- **Option G**: Property rights are not infringed upon unconstitutionally; zoning changes and referendums are common.
- **Option H**: Zoning is a legislative function, and referendums can apply to such changes.
- **Option I**: The referendum is not invalid solely on public policy grounds without a constitutional violation.

The Supreme Court has upheld referendums in zoning matters as a legitimate exercise of democratic power, provided they do not infringe on fundamental rights. Here, the referendum process is valid and does not violate due process.
