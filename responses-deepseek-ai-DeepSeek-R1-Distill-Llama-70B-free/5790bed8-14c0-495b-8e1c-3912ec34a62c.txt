Question:

An accounting professor has been called as a defense expert witness in a white-collar criminal case. He testified that accounting records conclusively demonstrated that the defendant had not committed any type of fraud. On cross-examination of the professor, the prosecuting attorney asked him if he was familiar with a particular treatise. The professor responded affirmatively. The attorney then asked him if the treatise was accepted as authoritative and if he was aware of the conclusions regarding the ability of accountants to detect fraud. The professor responded in the affirmative. The prosecutor now attempts to read the following section of the treatise into evidence: "It is virtually impossible to state with conclusive certainty the existence, or lack thereof, of fraud in the majority of white-collar crime cases, given the sophistication of defendants and the variety of accounting methods available. "On objection by the defendant's attorney, the trial judge will

Options:

A: sustain the objection, because the professor did not rely on the treatise in making his conclusions.
B: sustain the objection, because the statements in the treatise are hearsay not within any recognized exception.
C: overrule the objection and permit the prosecutor to ask the professor about the treatise.
D: sustain the objection, because the prosecutor's question is leading.
E: sustain the objection, because the treatise is not relevant to the professor's testimony.
F: overrule the objection, because the treatise is considered a reliable source in the field of accounting.
G: overrule the objection, because the professor confirmed the treatise's authority.
H: overrule the objection and permit the entire treatise to be introduced into evidence.
I: sustain the objection, because the treatise's statements are opinion-based.
J: overrule the objection and permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence.

Okay, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with hearsay exceptions and expert testimony. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that an accounting professor is testifying as a defense expert in a white-collar criminal case. He says the accounting records show the defendant didn't commit fraud. Then, on cross-examination, the prosecutor asks him about a treatise. The professor confirms he's familiar with it and that it's authoritative. The prosecutor wants to read a specific section from the treatise into evidence. The defense objects, and we need to determine if the objection is sustained or overruled.

Hmm, so the key issue here is whether the treatise section can be admitted into evidence over the objection. I remember that treatises can be admitted under certain conditions, especially when dealing with expert testimony.

I think under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), expert opinion can be based on treatises or publications if they are established as reliable authority. But wait, there's a specific rule about this. FRE 803(18) provides an exception for treatises in cases where the expert relies on them, or they are called to the attention of the expert during cross-examination.

So in this case, the professor didn't rely on the treatise in his testimony; he was just asked about it on cross. But the prosecutor is trying to use a section from the treatise that contradicts the professor's earlier conclusion. 

Wait, the professor said he's familiar with the treatise and considers it authoritative. So when the prosecutor brings up this treatise, it's being used to impeach the professor's testimony. The treatise's statement is being offered to show that the professor's opinion was wrong because it's contrary to an authoritative source he respects.

But is this allowed? I think yes. Because under FRE 803(18), if the expert recognizes the treatise as authoritative, then the opposing party can read from it to contradict the expert's testimony. So even though the expert didn't rely on the treatise in forming his opinion, the fact that he acknowledges its authority allows the prosecutor to use it to challenge his conclusions.

Wait, but the options are about what the judge will do. So the options are about sustaining or overruling the objection.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the objection is sustained because the professor didn't rely on the treatise. But I think the fact that the professor acknowledged the treatise's authority is enough to allow its use for impeachment, regardless of reliance. So A might not be correct.

Option B suggests it's hearsay without exception. But 803(18) is a hearsay exception for treatises, so B is incorrect.

Option C says the judge overrules and permits the prosecutor to ask about the treatise. Wait, the prosecutor is trying to read the section into evidence, not just ask about it. So maybe C isn't exactly right.

Option F says it's overruled because it's a reliable source. But the rule is more about the expert's recognition of authority, not just the source's reliability. F might be a possible answer.

Option G says overruled because the professor confirmed the treatise's authority. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier. The professor acknowledged it as authoritative, so the prosecutor can use it to contradict his testimony.

Option J says only the contradictory parts are read. I think that's allowed under the rule, which permits the opposing party to read the relevant portions that contradict the expert's opinion.

Wait, so the correct approach is that the treatise can be used to impeach the expert's testimony by reading the contradictory section because the expert acknowledged the treatise as authoritative. Therefore, the objection should be overruled.

Looking at the options again:

Option G says overrule because the professor confirmed the authority. That fits.

Option J says permit only the contradictory parts. I think that's correct too, but the question is about whether the objection is sustained or overruled. So the correct ruling is to overrule, allowing the prosecutor to read the section.

So looking back, the answer would be either G or J. Oh wait, option G says permit the prosecutor to ask the professor about the treatise. But the prosecutor is trying to read the section into evidence, not just ask questions. So maybe J is better because it's about reading the contradictory statements into evidence.

Wait, the rule under FRE 803(18) allows the statement to be read into evidence if the expert recognizes the treatise as authoritative. So the prosecutor can read the specific section. So the judge would overrule the objection and allow it, which points to either G, F, or J.

Option G says permit the prosecutor to ask about the treatise. But the prosecutor is trying to read from it. So perhaps J is the correct answer because it's about reading only the contradictory parts into evidence.

Alternatively, option F says it's reliable, so overruled. But the key factor is the expert's acknowledgment, not just the treatise's reliability. So G seems more accurate.

Wait, but the treatise is hearsay, but falls under the exception. So the objection would be overruled because the treatise is admissible under 803(18) as an exception.

So the correct answer should be that the judge overrules the objection, allowing the treatise section to be read. The options that fit this are G and J.

Wait, option J says "permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence." That sounds correct because the rule allows the opposing party to read the specific part that contradicts the expert's opinion.

So the answer would be J: overrule and permit only the contradictory statements to be read.

But wait, another thought: The treatise is hearsay, but under FRE 803(18), it's admissible if it's called to the expert's attention during cross and the expert acknowledges it as authoritative. So the prosecutor can read the specific section into evidence for the purpose of contradicting the expert.

So the judge would overrule the objection, allowing the prosecutor to read that section. So the correct options are either G, F, or J.

Option G says permit the prosecutor to ask the professor about the treatise. But the prosecutor is trying to read it into evidence, not just ask questions. So maybe J is better because it's about reading the contradictory part.

Alternatively, option F says it's a reliable source, so overruled. But the key is the expert's recognition, not just reliability. So G is better.

Wait, the rule says that if the expert relies on the treatise or it's called to their attention during cross and they acknowledge it as authoritative, then the opposing party may read the relevant portion. So the fact that the expert acknowledged it as authoritative allows the use of the treatise against him.

So the objection would be overruled, and the treatise section would be admitted. So the correct answer is either G or J.

Looking again, the options:

Option G: overrule the objection and permit the prosecutor to ask the professor about the treatise. But the treatise is being read into evidence, not just being a topic of questions. So perhaps J is more accurate.

Option J: overrule and permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence. That makes sense because the prosecutor is using it to contradict the expert's prior testimony.

So I think the correct answer is J.

The question revolves around whether a prosecutor can read a section from a treatise into evidence to contradict the testimony of an expert witness, an accounting professor, in a white-collar criminal case. The professor testified that accounting records conclusively demonstrated the defendant did not commit fraud. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked the professor about a treatise, and the professor acknowledged its authority. The prosecutor then sought to read a specific section of the treatise into evidence, which stated that it is virtually impossible to determine the existence or absence of fraud with conclusive certainty in many white-collar crime cases.

The key issue is whether the treatise section can be admitted into evidence over the defense's objection. Under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 803(18), treatises are admissible as an exception to hearsay if they are recognized as authoritative by the expert witness or if they are called to the expert's attention during cross-examination. Here, the professor acknowledged the treatise as authoritative, allowing the prosecutor to use the specific section to impeach the professor's testimony by showing it contradicts his earlier conclusion.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The professor's reliance on the treatise is not the determining factor; the treatise's authority and its use for impeachment are sufficient.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The treatise falls under the hearsay exception in FRE 803(18), so it is not barred as hearsay.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The prosecutor is not merely asking about the treatise but seeking to read a specific section into evidence.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The objection is not about the question being leading but about the admissibility of the treatise section.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The treatise is relevant because it directly contradicts the professor's testimony.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. While the treatise may be reliable, the key factor is the professor's acknowledgment of its authority.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The prosecutor is not just asking about the treatise but reading a specific section into evidence.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The entire treatise is not being introduced, only the contradictory section.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The treatise's statements are not barred as opinion-based under the given circumstances.
- **Option J**: Correct. The objection is overruled because the treatise is recognized as authoritative, and the specific section can be read into evidence to contradict the professor's testimony.

The correct ruling is that the objection is overruled, and the prosecutor is permitted to read the contradictory section of the treatise into evidence. 

Answer: J
