Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read it again.

So, the situation is: A homeowner conveys his property to his cousin "for life, with remainder to the homeowner's heirs." Then, later, the cousin conveys the property to a farmer "for as long as he would continue to farm the property." After the cousin's death, the homeowner's heirs are suing the farmer to quiet title. The question is about which common law doctrine applies here.

Hmm. I remember that property law, especially conveyances, involves a lot of different estates and future interests. Let's think about the initial conveyance first.

The homeowner gave the property to the cousin for life, with a remainder to the homeowner's heirs. So, the cousin has a life estate. Life estates are measured by the life of a person, which could be the holder (like "to A for life") or someone else ("to A for the life of B", which is called a life estate pur autre vie).

Wait, the cousin's life estate is from the homeowner's conveyance. So, the cousin has a life estate, and the remainder goes to the homeowner's heirs. But wait, remainders can be either vested or contingent. The heirs here would be a class that might exist at the termination of the life estate. So, the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs, which could be a contingent remainder because the class might not be ascertained yet. Or is it vested?

Wait, no. The homeowner's heirs are a class that is subject to open until the homeowner's death, I think. So when the homeowner dies, his heirs are determined. But in this case, the conveyance is to the cousin for life, then to the homeowner's heirs. So at the time the cousin's life estate ends (when the cousin dies), the homeowner might still be alive, or maybe not. Hmm, this might complicate things.

Wait, no, the homeowner is the one conveying. So the homeowner's heirs would only inherit after the homeowner's death. So if the homeowner is still alive when the cousin dies, then the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs, but the homeowner hasn't died yet, so the heirs aren't determined. So that would make the remainder contingent, right? Because it's subject to a condition—the homeowner's death—and the class hasn't closed yet.

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think. The conveyance is "for life, with remainder to (the homeowner's) heirs." So, the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs, which would take effect after the life estate. So, the cousin's life estate is for their life, and then the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs, meaning after the cousin dies, the property goes to whoever the homeowner's heirs are at that time.

Wait, but the homeowner is the original grantor. So, the homeowner's heirs would take only after the homeowner's death. But if the homeowner is still alive when the cousin dies, then the remainder would go to the homeowner's heirs at that point, which might not make sense because the homeowner is still alive. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. 

Alternatively, perhaps the conveyance creates a life estate in the cousin, with a remainder to the homeowner's heirs. If the homeowner is still alive when the cousin dies, then the remainder would go to the homeowner's heirs, but the homeowner hasn't died yet. Wait, that doesn't make sense because heirs are those who inherit upon death. So maybe in this case, the remainder is to the homeowner's estate, but that seems a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs, but since the homeowner is still alive, the remainder is to the heirs of the homeowner, which are contingent. So, when the cousin's life estate ends, the property goes to the homeowner's heirs, but only if the homeowner has died by then. So if the homeowner is alive when the cousin dies, then the remainder would either lapse or pass to someone else. Hmm. Maybe I should think about the possible doctrines here.

The cousin later conveys the property to a farmer "for as long as he would continue to farm the property." So, the cousin, who has a life estate, is trying to convey an interest to the farmer. But what kind of interest can the cousin convey? As a life tenant, the cousin has the right to possess the property during their life, but they can't convey an interest beyond their own life estate without the consent of the remainderman. So, if the cousin tries to convey a lease or some other estate, it might not be valid beyond their own life estate.

Wait, but the conveyance is "for as long as he would continue to farm the property." That sounds like a fee simple determinable, perhaps. Or maybe a life estate? Or a leasehold. But wait, the cousin only has a life estate. So any conveyance by the cousin can't create an interest that extends beyond their own life estate, unless it's a sublease or something.

So, when the cousin dies, the life estate ends, and the remainder kicks in, which is to the homeowner's heirs. So, after the cousin's death, the farmer is still on the property. The farmer's interest was granted by the cousin, but does that interest survive the cousin's death?

Wait, that's the key issue. The farmer's interest was created by the cousin, who only had a life estate. So, any interest the farmer has can't outlast the cousin's life estate unless the remainderman (the homeowner's heirs) agrees. Otherwise, when the cousin dies, the farmer's interest would end, and the property would go to the remaindermen.

So, the farmer's conveyance is for as long as he farms the property. That sounds like a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, but the cousin can't grant a fee simple because he only has a life estate. So, the farmer's interest would be limited to the duration of the cousin's life estate. So, when the cousin dies, the farmer's right to the property ends, and the remainder to the homeowner's heirs takes effect.

But wait, the question is about which doctrine applies. So, what's the doctrine that deals with the interest created by a life tenant that extends beyond their life estate.

I remember that when a life tenant purports to convey an interest that would outlast their own life estate, the grant is valid only for the duration of the life estate. The doctrine is called the "doctrine of waste," perhaps? Or maybe it's the "doctrine of life estate" limitations.

Wait, another thought: The cousin's conveyance to the farmer might create a future interest in the farmer, but since the cousin only has a life estate, any such future interest would not be valid beyond the life estate. Alternatively, the farmer's interest would terminate upon the cousin's death.

Wait, but the farmer's interest is "for as long as he would continue to farm," which is a condition that could last beyond the cousin's life. So, perhaps the farmer's interest is a determinable fee, but again, the cousin can't grant a fee because he doesn't own it. So, the farmer's interest is a lease for the duration of the cousin's life, maybe? Or perhaps it's a life estate measured by the farmer's life, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, the cousin's conveyance to the farmer would create a tenancy for the duration of the farming, but limited to the cousin's life estate. So, when the cousin dies, the farmer's interest ends, and the remainder to the homeowner's heirs begins.

Wait, but after the cousin's death, the farmer is still there, so the heirs sue to quiet title. The question is, what doctrine applies here.

I think the key is that the cousin's conveyance to the farmer only gave the farmer an interest that could last as long as the cousin's life estate. So, when the cousin dies, the farmer's interest ends. Therefore, the homeowner's heirs, as remaindermen, now have the right to possession.

But wait, is there a doctrine that specifically addresses this situation? I think it's the Doctrine of Life Estate Pur Autre Vie. Wait, no, that's when the life estate is measured by someone else's life.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the Doctrine of Merger applies. Merger occurs when the same person holds two estates, and the smaller estate is merged into the larger one. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, the Doctrine of Destructibility of Contingent Remainders. Oh, right! Wait, a contingent remainder is destructible if the condition isn't met before the natural termination of the preceding estate. So, if the contingent remainder isn't vested by the time the life estate ends, it's destroyed, and the property reverts to the grantor or their heirs.

Wait, in this case, the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs. If the homeowner is still alive when the cousin's life estate ends (when the cousin dies), then the remainder would be to the homeowner's heirs, but since the homeowner is alive, the heirs aren't determined yet. So, the remainder is contingent because it's subject to the condition that the homeowner dies, and the class hasn't closed.

So, if the cousin's life estate ends and the remainder is still contingent (homeowner still alive), then the contingent remainder is destroyed, and the property would revert to the grantor (the homeowner) or their heirs? Wait, no, because the grantor (homeowner) conveyed it to the cousin for life, then to their own heirs. So, if the contingent remainder is destroyed, does the property go back to the grantor's estate?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The original conveyance is: homeowner conveys to cousin for life, remainder to homeowner's heirs. So, the cousin has a life estate, and the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs, which is a contingent remainder because it's subject to the condition that the homeowner has died by the end of the cousin's life estate.

If the cousin dies, and the homeowner is still alive, then the contingent remainder hasn't vested because the condition (homeowner's death) hasn't occurred. Therefore, the contingent remainder would lapse under the doctrine of destructibility of contingent remainders. So, the property would revert to the grantor (the homeowner) because the contingent remainder is destroyed.

Wait, but the homeowner is the original grantor. So, if the contingent remainder is destroyed, the property would go back to the grantor or their estate. But the grantor is still alive, so it would go back to them. But in this case, the grantor (homeowner) has already conveyed the property, so perhaps it would go to their estate upon their death.

Wait, but in this scenario, when the cousin dies, the homeowner is still alive. So, the contingent remainder to the homeowner's heirs is not yet vested because the homeowner hasn't died. Therefore, the contingent remainder is destroyed, and the property reverts to the grantor (homeowner). But the homeowner is the original grantor, so the property would go back to them, but they already conveyed it. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the Rule in Shelley's Case applies. Shelley's Case says that when a life estate is given to one person, and the remainder to that person's heirs, it creates a fee simple because it's assumed that the remainder is intended to take effect immediately after the life estate, implying that the life tenant's heirs are the same as the grantor's heirs. But I'm not sure if that applies here because the grantor is conveying to their cousin for life, then to their own heirs, not the cousin's.

Wait, Shelley's Case is when the grant is to A for life, then to A's heirs. In that case, A gets a life estate and the remainder is to A's heirs, which is a contingent remainder. But under Shelley's Case, this creates a fee simple in A because it's assumed that A's interest would merge with the remainder. So, A would have a fee simple absolute.

But in our case, the grant is to cousin for life, then to the grantor's (homeowner's) heirs. So, it's not to the cousin's heirs, but to the grantor's heirs. So Shelley's Case wouldn't apply here because it's not the same person. So, the remainder is to the grantor's heirs, which is a different situation.

So, going back, the cousin has a life estate. The remainder is to the homeowner's heirs, which is contingent because the homeowner is still alive. So, when the cousin dies, if the homeowner is still alive, the contingent remainder hasn't vested, so it's destroyed under the doctrine of destructibility of contingent remainders. Therefore, the property reverts to the grantor, the homeowner. But the homeowner is alive, so they would take it back, but they had already conveyed it to the cousin for life. Wait, but the grantor can't take it back because they've already given it away, unless the remainder reverts to them.

Hmm, perhaps the correct doctrine here is the destructibility of contingent remainders. So, the answer might be E.

Wait, but let me think again. When the cousin conveys to the farmer, what happens? The cousin only has a life estate, so any conveyance beyond that would not be valid. So, the farmer's interest would only last as long as the cousin's life estate. So, when the cousin dies, the farmer's interest ends, and the property goes to the remaindermen, the homeowner's heirs. But if the contingent remainder is destroyed because it's still contingent (homeowner alive), then the property reverts to the grantor, the homeowner, making the farmer's interest invalid beyond the cousin's life.

Wait, but in the scenario, after the cousin's death, the farmer is still there, and the heirs are suing. So, the farmer's interest, if any, would have ended upon the cousin's death because the cousin couldn't convey more than their life estate. So, the farmer's interest would terminate, and the heirs would have the right to possession. But the question is about which doctrine is most applicable.

Another angle: The cousin, as a life tenant, attempted to convey an interest that would continue beyond their life estate. The Doctrine of Life Tenant's Powers might limit this. A life tenant cannot convey an estate that extends beyond their own interest without the consent of the remaindermen. So, the farmer's interest would only last as long as the cousin's life estate. So, when the cousin dies, the farmer's interest ends, and the remainder kicks in.

But the remainder is to the homeowner's heirs, which is contingent. So, if the contingent remainder is destroyed, the property would revert to the grantor. But the grantor is the homeowner, who is still alive. So, perhaps the farmer's interest is valid only during the cousin's life, and upon the cousin's death, the farmer has no right to stay, so the heirs can evict him.

Wait, but the question is about the doctrine that would determine ownership. So, the key issue is that the cousin's conveyance to the farmer is beyond the cousin's life estate, which isn't possible. Therefore, the farmer's interest is only valid during the cousin's life. So, when the cousin dies, the farmer's interest ends, and the remaindermen (heirs) take over. But since the remainder is contingent and not yet vested, it's destroyed, so the property reverts to the grantor (homeowner), but the homeowner is still alive. So, perhaps the property would then go to the homeowner, making the heirs' interest invalid.

Wait, but the heirs are suing to quiet title. So, if the contingent remainder is destroyed, then the property would revert to the grantor (homeowner), but the homeowner is still alive. So, the heirs wouldn't have a claim. Alternatively, perhaps the heirs would take because the contingent remainder hasn't been destroyed yet. I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doctrine of Merger applies. Merger happens when the same person owns two consecutive estates. But in this case, the cousins are conveying to the farmer, so it's not the same person. So, merger probably isn't the issue.

Wait, going back to the options. The options are A through J.

Option E is Doctrine of Destructibility of Contingent Remainders. That would apply if the contingent remainder is destroyed because the condition wasn't met during the life estate.

So, if the contingent remainder to the homeowner's heirs is destroyed, then the property reverts to the grantor (homeowner), and the farmer's interest ends. So, the heirs would have no claim, but the grantor (homeowner) would. But the homeowner is alive, so perhaps the property goes back to them, and the farmer is trespassing.

Wait, but in the problem, the heirs are suing, not the homeowner. So, if the contingent remainder was destroyed, the heirs wouldn't have a claim because the remainder was destroyed. Therefore, the farmer might not have any right either because his interest ended with the cousin's death.

Hmm, but the farmer's interest was granted during the cousin's life. So, when the cousin dies, the farmer's lease or whatever it was ends. So, the property would go to the remaindermen, but if the remainder is destroyed, then the property goes back to the grantor, who is the homeowner. But the homeowner is alive, so they would take possession, not the heirs.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the key is that the cousin's conveyance to the farmer is limited to the cousin's life estate. So, when the cousin dies, the farmer's interest ends. Therefore, the remainder to the homeowner's heirs takes effect. But if the remainder is contingent and hasn't vested, it's destroyed, so the property reverts to the grantor (homeowner). So, the heirs don't have a claim, but the homeowner does. But the homeowner is still alive, so perhaps they are the ones who should sue, not the heirs.

Wait, but in the problem, the heirs are suing. So, perhaps the doctrine that applies is E, the destructibility of contingent remainders, because if the remainder is contingent and the condition isn't met, it's destroyed, and the heirs can't claim it. Therefore, the farmer has no right, and the property goes back to the homeowner, but since the heirs are suing, they lose because their interest was destroyed.

Alternatively, maybe the farmer's interest is valid only during the cousin's life, so after the cousin's death, the farmer has no right, and the property goes to the remaindermen, the heirs, but only if the remainder is vested. If the remainder is contingent, it's destroyed, so the heirs can't take it.

Wait, perhaps the Doctrine of Worthier Title applies. That's when a grantor attempts to create a remainder in someone else, but if the remainder is to the grantor's own heirs, it's considered a worthier title and might create a reversion. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, the Doctrine of Worthier Title says that if a grantor conveys property to A for life, with remainder to A's heirs, and A is the grantor's child, then under the doctrine, A takes
