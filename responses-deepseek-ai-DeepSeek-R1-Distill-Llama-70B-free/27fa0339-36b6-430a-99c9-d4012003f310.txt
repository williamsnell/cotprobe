Okay, so I have this problem where I need to write the number 270,240 in expanded form. I'm a bit rusty on expanded form, but I think it's where each digit is broken down by its place value and then added together. Let me try to remember how this works.

So, expanded form is like taking each digit and multiplying it by the place value it's in. For example, the number 123 would be 100 + 20 + 3. That makes sense. So each digit is separated into its thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones places.

Alright, let's apply that to 270,240. First, I should write down the number and break it down digit by digit. The number is 270,240. Let's count the digits: 2,7,0,2,4,0. Wait, no, waitâ€”wait, no, that's not right. Let me see. Actually, 270,240 is a six-digit number. Let me write it out with the commas for clarity: 270,240. So that's 2 (hundred thousands), 7 (ten thousands), 0 (thousands), 2 (hundreds), 4 (tens), and 0 (ones).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 270,240 is actually 2 followed by 7, 0, 2, 4, and 0? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. 270,240 is 2 (hundred thousands) because the first digit is 2. Then, the next digit is 7 in the ten thousands place. Then comes 0 in the thousands, right? So after the hundred thousands and ten thousands, the next is thousands, which is 0. Then comes hundreds, which is 2, tens is 4, and ones is 0.

So breaking it down: 

- 2 is in the hundred thousands place, so 2 x 100,000 = 200,000.
- 7 is in the ten thousands place, so 7 x 10,000 = 70,000.
- 0 is in the thousands place, which is 0 x 1,000 = 0. So we can ignore that since it's zero.
- 2 is in the hundreds place, so 2 x 100 = 200.
- 4 is in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40.
- 0 is in the ones place, which is 0 x 1 = 0. Also ignored.

So adding those up, it's 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40. 

Now I need to look at the options and see which one matches this. Let's go through each option:

A: 200,000 + 70,000 + 2,000 + 400. Hmm, that's 2 thousand, which I don't think is correct because our hundreds place was 200, not 2,000. So A is probably wrong.

B: 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40. Oh, that's exactly what I have. So B could be the correct choice.

Wait, but let me check the others to make sure. 

C: 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 400. Oh, that's 400 instead of 40. So that's 4 hundreds instead of 4 tens. So C is wrong.

D: 200,000 + 70,000 + 2,400. That would combine 200 and 40 into 240, but expanded form requires each place to be separate. So D is incorrect.

E: 200,000 + 70,000 + 2,000 + 40. Again, 2,000 is wrong. The hundreds place is 200, so E is out.

F: 200,000 + 7,000 + 200 + 4. Here, the ten thousands place is 7,000 instead of 70,000. So that's incorrect. It should be 70,000, not 7,000.

G: 200,000 + 7,000 + 200 + 40. Same issue as F; the ten thousands are wrong.

H: 200,000 + 70,000 + 20,000 + 40. Oh wait, 20,000 is in the ten thousands place? No, wait, the third digit is 0, which is thousands place. So 20,000 would be if the thousands digit was 2, but it's 0. So H is incorrect.

I: 270,000 + 200 + 40. Wait, 270,000 is combining the first three digits, but since the thousands place is 0, that's actually correct. Wait, 270,000 is 2*100,000 +7*10,000 +0*1,000, which is correct. Then adding 200 and 40. So that's another way to write it. So I think I might have another correct option here.

Wait, but the question is about expanded form. Does expanded form require each digit's place value to be separate? I think yes. So 270,000 is combining the hundred thousands, ten thousands, and thousands digits into one term. Whereas in expanded form, each place is separate, so we should have 200,000 +70,000, etc.

So I think option B is the correct expanded form, while option I is a partially combined form.

J: 200,000 + 7,000 + 20,000 + 40. Again, 7,000 is wrong for ten thousands, and 20,000 is incorrect because the thousands digit is 0.

So the correct answer is option B.

To write 270,240 in expanded form, each digit is multiplied by its place value and then summed. Breaking down 270,240:

- **2** is in the hundred thousands place: \( 2 \times 100,000 = 200,000 \)
- **7** is in the ten thousands place: \( 7 \times 10,000 = 70,000 \)
- **0** is in the thousands place: \( 0 \times 1,000 = 0 \) (ignored)
- **2** is in the hundreds place: \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \)
- **4** is in the tens place: \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \)
- **0** is in the ones place: \( 0 \times 1 = 0 \) (ignored)

Thus, the expanded form is \( 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40 \).

Now, analyzing the options:

- **A:** Includes \( 2,000 \), which is incorrect for the hundreds place.
- **B:** Matches \( 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40 \), the correct expanded form.
- **C:** Includes \( 400 \) instead of \( 40 \), which is incorrect.
- **D:** Combines \( 200 + 40 = 2,400 \), which is not expanded form.
- **E:** Includes \( 2,000 \), which is incorrect for the hundreds place.
- **F:** Includes \( 7,000 \) instead of \( 70,000 \), which is incorrect.
- **G:** Same issue as F with \( 7,000 \).
- **H:** Includes \( 20,000 \), which is incorrect for the thousands place.
- **I:** Combines \( 270,000 \), which is not fully expanded.
- **J:** Includes \( 7,000 \) and \( 20,000 \), both incorrect.

The correct answer is **B**.

B
