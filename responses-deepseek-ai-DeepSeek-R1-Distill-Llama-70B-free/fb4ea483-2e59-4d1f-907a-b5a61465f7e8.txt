Okay, so I've got this question about the theoretical limit on angular resolution for telescopes with different objective diameters. Hmm, angular resolution, right, that's the smallest angle between two point objects that can be seen as separate. I remember something about the Rayleigh criterion and the diffraction limit.

Oh wait, the formula for resolving power. I think it's theta = 1.22 * lambda / D. Or wait, is it lambda/(2D)? No, wait, I think the Rayleigh formula is theta ≈ 1.22 lambda / (D), where D is the diameter of the aperture, like the telescope's mirror or lens. And lambda is the wavelength of light, which here is given as 550 nm.

Wait, but wait—lambda in what units? Oh, right, meters. So 550 nm is 550e-9 meters, right. And the diameters are in millimeters and meters. Let me convert them all to meters.

The question gives three diameters: 100 mm, 1 m, and 5 m. So converting:

100 mm = 0.1 m
1 m = 1 m
5 m = 5 m.

So for each D, I'll calculate theta in radians using the formula theta = 1.22 * lambda / D.

Let's compute each one step by step.

First, for D = 0.1 m:

theta = 1.22 * 550e-9 m / 0.1 m

Wait, 550e-9 is 5.5e-7 m. So 1.22 * 5.5e-7 = let's compute that.

1.22 * 5.5 = 6.71. So 6.71e-7. Then divide by 0.1, which is multiplying by 10. So 6.71e-7 * 10 = 6.71e-6 radians.

Okay, so for D=100mm, theta is approximately 6.71e-6 rad.

Next, D=1m:

theta = 1.22 * 550e-9 / 1.

So 1.22 * 5.5e-7 = 6.71e-7 radians.

So D=1m gives 6.71e-7 rad.

Then D=5m:

theta = 1.22 * 550e-9 /5.

Compute numerator first: 1.22 *5.5e-7 = 6.71e-7. Then divide by 5: 6.71e-7 /5 = 1.342e-7 rad.

Wait wait, let me compute that again. 6.71e-7 divided by 5 is 1.342e-7, right. So approximately 1.34e-7 rad.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which one matches these three values.

Looking at the options:

Option B says 6.71e-6 rad for D=100mm, 6.71e-7 for D=1m, 1.34e-7 for D=5m. That's exactly what I calculated.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option E has different diameters, like 200mm, so it's not the same. Option H has 7.71e-6 for 100mm, which is higher. Option A has lower numbers for 5m. Option C's 5m is 1e-7, which is less than what I found. So Option B seems correct.

Wait, but wait—let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake.

550 nm is 550e-9 m. So 1.22 * 550e-9 = ?

550 is 5.5e2, so 5.5e2 * 1.22 = 6.71e2, but since it's 550e-9, it's 6.71e-7. Right.

Divide by D:

For D=0.1 m: 6.71e-7 / 0.1 = 6.71e-6.

D=1m: 6.71e-7.

D=5m: 6.71e-7 /5=1.342e-7.

Yes, so the correct option is B.

To determine the theoretical limit on angular resolution for telescopes with objective diameters of 100 mm, 1 m, and 5 m, we use the Rayleigh criterion formula for resolving power:

\[
\theta = 1.22 \frac{\lambda}{D}
\]

where:
- \( \lambda = 550 \, \text{nm} = 550 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \),
- \( D \) is the diameter of the objective in meters.

### Calculations:
1. **For \( D = 100 \, \text{mm} = 0.1 \, \text{m} \):**
   \[
   \theta = 1.22 \frac{550 \times 10^{-9}}{0.1} = 1.22 \times 5.5 \times 10^{-7} = 6.71 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{rad}
   \]

2. **For \( D = 1 \, \text{m} \):**
   \[
   \theta = 1.22 \frac{550 \times 10^{-9}}{1} = 1.22 \times 5.5 \times 10^{-7} = 6.71 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{rad}
   \]

3. **For \( D = 5 \, \text{m} \):**
   \[
   \theta = 1.22 \frac{550 \times 10^{-9}}{5} = \frac{6.71 \times 10^{-7}}{5} = 1.34 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{rad}
   \]

### Matching with Options:
- **Option A:** The values for \( D = 5 \, \text{m} \) are too low.
- **Option B:** Matches the calculated values:
  - \( 6.71 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{rad} \) for \( D = 100 \, \text{mm} \),
  - \( 6.71 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{rad} \) for \( D = 1 \, \text{m} \),
  - \( 1.34 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{rad} \) for \( D = 5 \, \text{m} \).
- **Option C:** The values for \( D = 5 \, \text{m} \) are too low.
- **Option D:** The values for \( D = 5 \, \text{m} \) are too low.
- **Option E:** The diameters listed do not match the question.
- **Option F:** The values are too high for all diameters.
- **Option G:** The values are too high for all diameters.
- **Option H:** The values are too high for all diameters.
- **Option I:** The values are too high for all diameters.
- **Option J:** The values are too high for all diameters.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it matches the calculated angular resolutions for all three diameters.
