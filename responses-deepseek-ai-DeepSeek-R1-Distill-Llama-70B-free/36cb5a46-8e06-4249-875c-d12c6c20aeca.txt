Okay, so I've got this system of equations to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of solving linear systems. But I'll take it step by step.

The equations given are:

1. 7x - y = 15x
2. -6x + 8y = 15y

Hmm, I think I should start by simplifying each equation so it's easier to work with. Let's take the first equation: 7x - y = 15x. Maybe I can get all the x terms on one side and the y terms on the other. So if I subtract 7x from both sides, that would give me -y = 8x. Oh wait, that's the same as y = -8x. So that's the simplified version of the first equation.

Now the second equation: -6x + 8y = 15y. Let's see, subtract 15y from both sides to get the y terms together. That gives me -6x + 8y -15y = 0, which simplifies to -6x -7y = 0. Or, rearranged, 6x +7y =0. Alternatively, I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let me try solving for x here. So, 6x = -7y, which means x = (-7y)/(6). Hmm, not sure if that's the best approach, but maybe substitution will work.

Wait, from the first equation, I have y expressed in terms of x: y = -8x. Maybe I can substitute this into the second equation. Let me try that.

So the second equation is 6x +7y=0. Substituting y = -8x into this gives 6x +7*(-8x) =0. Let's calculate that: 6x -56x =0. Combining like terms gives -50x =0. Wait, that would mean x=0. But let me double-check that.

Wait, wait, substituting y = -8x into 6x +7y =0:

6x +7*(-8x) =6x -56x = (6-56)x = (-50)x =0.

So -50x=0 → x=0. Hmm, but I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the substitution or simplification.

Let me go back to the first equation: 7x - y =15x. Subtract 7x both sides: -y =8x → y= -8x. That seems correct.

In the second equation: -6x +8y=15y. Subtract 15y: -6x -7y=0 → 6x +7y=0. That seems right too.

So substituting y=-8x into 6x +7y=0 gives 6x +7*(-8x)=6x-56x= -50x=0 → x=0.

If x=0, then y= -8*0=0. So the solution is (0,0). But wait, looking at the options, option G is 0. So x=0, which is option G.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes systems can have no solution or infinitely many solutions. Let me check if both equations are consistent and independent.

If I plug x=0 into the first equation: 7*0 - y =15*0 → -y=0 → y=0. Which matches.

Second equation: -6*0 +8y=15y → 8y=15y → 8y-15y=0 → -7y=0 → y=0. So yes, (0,0) satisfies both equations.

So the x-value is 0. Looking back at the options, option G is 0. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try solving the system using another method, like elimination, to confirm.

Let me rewrite the equations:

1. 7x - y =15x → 7x -15x - y=0 → -8x - y=0 → 8x + y=0 (I multiplied both sides by -1 to make it positive x coefficient.)
2. -6x +8y =15y → -6x +8y -15y=0 → -6x -7y=0 → 6x +7y=0.

So now equation 1 is 8x + y=0, and equation 2 is 6x +7y=0.

Let me use elimination. Multiply equation 1 by 7 to make the y coefficients opposites.

Equation 1 multiplied by 7: 56x +7y=0.

Equation 2 is 6x +7y=0.

Now subtract equation 2 from the scaled equation 1:

(56x +7y) - (6x +7y) =0-0 → 50x +0=0 → 50x=0 → x=0.

Same result. So yeah, x=0 is correct. Therefore, the answer is G.

To solve the linear system:

1. \( 7x - y = 15x \)  
2. \( -6x + 8y = 15y \),  

we start by simplifying each equation.  

For the first equation:  
\[
7x - y = 15x \implies -y = 8x \implies y = -8x.
\]  

For the second equation:  
\[
-6x + 8y = 15y \implies -6x - 7y = 0 \implies 6x + 7y = 0.
\]  

Next, substitute \( y = -8x \) into \( 6x + 7y = 0 \):  
\[
6x + 7(-8x) = 0 \implies 6x - 56x = 0 \implies -50x = 0 \implies x = 0.
\]  

Substituting \( x = 0 \) back into \( y = -8x \):  
\[
y = -8(0) = 0.
\]  

Thus, the solution to the system is \( (x, y) = (0, 0) \). The \( x \)-value is \( 0 \), which corresponds to option **G**.
