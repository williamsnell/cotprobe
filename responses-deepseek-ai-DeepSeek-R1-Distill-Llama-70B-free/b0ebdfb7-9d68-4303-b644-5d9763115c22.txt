Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says.

The problem states that X and Y are independent random variables with normal distributions. X follows N(5,16), which I think means it has a mean of 5 and a variance of 16. Similarly, Y is N(6,9), so mean 6 and variance 9. The question is asking for P(X > Y), which is the same as P(X - Y > 0).

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with the difference of two independent normal variables, the result is also a normal variable. So X - Y should be normally distributed. Let me try to recall the properties.

The mean of X - Y would be the mean of X minus the mean of Y. So that's 5 - 6, which equals -1. Wait, no, that's not right. Because X has mean 5, Y has mean 6. So X - Y would have mean 5 - 6 = -1. Oh wait, no, wait! Wait, wait a second. Wait, no, X has a mean of 5, Y has a mean of 6. So X - Y would have a mean of 5 -6 = -1. But wait, in the problem, we're looking for P(X > Y), which is the same as P(X - Y > 0). So that's the probability that a normal variable with mean -1 is greater than 0. Hmm, that's interesting.

Wait a minute, let me make sure. So, X ~ N(5,16) means X has mean 5 and variance 16 (so standard deviation 4). Y ~ N(6,9) means Y has mean 6 and variance 9 (std dev 3). So X - Y will have mean (5 -6) = -1.

But wait, no, I think I might have it backwards. Let me check: when you subtract two independent normals, the mean is μ_X - μ_Y, which is 5 -6 = -1. So yes, the mean of X - Y is -1.

Now, the variance of X - Y is the sum of the variances because X and Y are independent. So Var(X - Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) = 16 + 9 = 25. So the standard deviation is sqrt(25) =5.

So X - Y is a normal variable with mean -1 and standard deviation 5. Now, we need to find P(X - Y > 0). Which is the same as P(Z > (0 - (-1))/5) in the standard normal distribution.

Wait, let me think again. To standardize X - Y, we can compute Z = (X - Y - μ)/(σ), where μ is the mean and σ the standard deviation. So here, μ is -1, σ is 5.

So, P(X - Y > 0) = P((X-Y - (-1))/5 > (0 - (-1))/5) = P(Z > 1/5) = P(Z > 0.2).

Now, what's P(Z > 0.2)? Well, the standard normal distribution tables give the probability that Z is less than a value. So P(Z > 0.2) = 1 - P(Z ≤ 0.2).

Looking up 0.2 in the standard normal table, the value at 0.2 is approximately 0.5793. So 1 - 0.5793 = 0.4207. So the probability is about 0.4207.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through each step again.

1. X ~ N(5,16): so μ_X=5, σ_X^2=16, σ_X=4.
2. Y ~ N(6,9): μ_Y=6, σ_Y^2=9, σ_Y=3.
3. X and Y are independent, so X-Y is also normal.
4. The mean of X-Y is μ_X - μ_Y = 5-6 = -1.
5. The variance of X-Y is σ_X^2 + σ_Y^2 =16+9=25, so σ=5.
6. So X-Y ~ N(-1,25).
7. We want P(X-Y > 0) = P(Z > (0 - (-1))/5) = P(Z > 0.2).
8. The standard normal distribution gives P(Z ≤ 0.2) ≈ 0.5793, so P(Z>0.2)=1 - 0.5793=0.4207.

So looking at the options, option F is 0.4207, so that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the Z calculation. So (X-Y) is a normal variable with mean -1, variance 25. So to find P(X-Y >0), we can write it as P( (X-Y +1)/5 > 1/5 ). So yes, Z = (X-Y +1)/5, so P(Z > 0.2).

Alternatively, using the formula: Z = (X - Y - (-1)) / 5, which is (X-Y +1)/5. So at X-Y=0, Z=(0+1)/5=1/5=0.2.

So yes, the calculation seems correct. So the probability is 0.4207, which is option F.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent normal random variables with \(X \sim N(5, 16)\) and \(Y \sim N(6, 9)\). This means \(X\) has a mean of 5 and a variance of 16, while \(Y\) has a mean of 6 and a variance of 9. The standard deviations are \(\sigma_X = 4\) and \(\sigma_Y = 3\), respectively.

The difference \(X - Y\) is also normally distributed because the difference of two independent normal variables is normal. The mean of \(X - Y\) is:

\[
\mu_{X-Y} = \mu_X - \mu_Y = 5 - 6 = -1
\]

The variance of \(X - Y\) is the sum of the variances:

\[
\sigma_{X-Y}^2 = \sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2 = 16 + 9 = 25
\]

Thus, the standard deviation is:

\[
\sigma_{X-Y} = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]

We need to evaluate \(P(X > Y)\), which is equivalent to \(P(X - Y > 0)\). To standardize \(X - Y\), we compute:

\[
Z = \frac{X - Y - \mu_{X-Y}}{\sigma_{X-Y}} = \frac{X - Y + 1}{5}
\]

The problem then reduces to finding \(P(Z > 0.2)\), where \(Z\) is a standard normal variable. Using the standard normal distribution table, we find:

\[
P(Z \leq 0.2) \approx 0.5793
\]

Thus:

\[
P(Z > 0.2) = 1 - P(Z \leq 0.2) = 1 - 0.5793 = 0.4207
\]

Comparing this result to the given options, the correct answer is:

**F: 0.4207**
