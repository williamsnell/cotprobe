Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Stevenson's view on the word "good." I remember that Stevenson was a philosopher who talked about ethics and language, especially in his book "Ethics and Language." From what I recall, he discussed how words like "good" have both descriptive and emotive meanings.

The question is asking about the pleasing emotive meaning of "good." Stevenson, if I'm not mistaken, said that words can have emotive functions, which are different from their descriptive or cognitive meanings. The emotive meaning is about the feelings or attitudes the word conveys.

So, the options are A through J, each representing a different type of use. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Dynamic use. I'm not too sure what that refers to. It might relate to how language is used dynamically in context, but I don't think that's directly related to emotive meaning.

Option B: Descriptive use. That's more about the literal or factual meaning of a word. So "good" would describe something with positive qualities. But the question is about the emotive aspect, so this might not be the right choice.

Option C: Inferential use. That has to do with drawing conclusions or inferences, which doesn't directly tie into the emotive aspect.

Option D: Propositional use. This refers to statements that can be true or false, again more about the descriptive side rather than the emotive.

Option E: Expressive use. Expressive use is about conveying feelings or emotions. Wait, but I think Stevenson might have categorized this differently. He talked about emotive meaning as part of the expressive function, but maybe the question is pointing towards evaluative.

Option F: Evaluative use. Evaluative would relate to making judgments or evaluations, which could tie into the emotive aspect because "good" is often used to express approval or a positive evaluation. But I'm trying to remember if Stevenson specifically linked the emotive meaning to evaluative use.

Option G: Analytical use. That's more about breaking things down into parts, which doesn't fit here.

Option H: Semantic use. That's about meaning in general, both descriptive and emotive, but the question is specifically about the emotive part.

Option I: Constructive use. Not sure about this one, maybe building something, but not directly relevant.

Option J: Pragmatic use. Pragmatics is about how context affects meaning, which is more about usage than the inherent emotive meaning.

Wait, Stevenson's theory, if I remember correctly, divided the meaning of "good" into two parts: the descriptive, which is about the properties of things, and the emotive, which is about expressing approval or influencing others. He called the emotive part the "magnet" effect because it attracts and directs attitudes.

So the question is about the emotive meaning fitting "good" for a particular use. The options are about what kind of use. Stevenson probably said that the emotive meaning makes "good" suitable for expressive use, which is about expressing emotions or attitudes. So option E: expressive use.

But wait, another angle: evaluative use is about making evaluations, which is tied to the emotive aspect because "good" is a value judgment. So is it F?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Descriptive is about facts, emotive is about feelings. The question is about the emotive meaning fitting it for a particular use. Stevenson's categories probably include both descriptive and emotive uses, but the question is about the emotive part.

Expressive use is when you use language to express your feelings. So if "good" has a pleasing emotive meaning, it's being used expressively. So the answer would be E: expressive use.

Wait, but I've also heard that Stevenson talked about "good" having both descriptive and emotive functions, and that the emotive function is more about persuasion or influencing others' attitudes. So maybe it's dynamic use? Dynamic might refer to the persuasive aspect, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, evaluative use is when you're evaluating something, which is a judgment. So the emotive meaning would fit it for evaluative use. So F.

I'm a bit torn. Let me try to recall. Stevenson's book "Ethics and Language" does discuss how "good" has both a descriptive meaning (which varies) and an emotive meaning, which is about expressing a positive attitude. He also talks about the persuasive function, which is the dynamic aspect. So maybe dynamic use is when you're trying to influence others, which would tie into the emotive meaning.

Wait, but the question is about the emotive meaning fitting it for a particular use. If the emotive meaning is about expressing approval, then that's expressive. So E: expressive use.

Alternatively, the dynamic use might be about how the word is used to change others' attitudes, which is a bit different. So maybe F is about making evaluations, which is more about judgment, whereas E is about expressing feelings.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the emotive meaning is for expressing feelings, so the use would be expressive. Therefore, the answer is E.

The question asks about Stevenson's view on the word "good" and its pleasing emotive meaning. Stevenson, in his work "Ethics and Language," distinguishes between the descriptive and emotive meanings of words. The descriptive meaning refers to factual properties, while the emotive meaning conveys feelings or attitudes. The question focuses on the emotive aspect of "good," which Stevenson describes as expressing approval or positive attitudes.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Dynamic use** refers to the persuasive or influential aspect of language, which might relate to the emotive meaning but is not the primary focus here.
- **B: Descriptive use** pertains to factual or literal meaning, which is not the focus of the question.
- **C: Inferential use** involves drawing conclusions, unrelated to the emotive aspect.
- **D: Propositional use** deals with truth values, again not relevant to emotive meaning.
- **E: Expressive use** involves conveying feelings or attitudes, aligning closely with the emotive meaning of "good."
- **F: Evaluative use** relates to making judgments, which could tie into the emotive aspect but is more about judgment than expressing feelings.
- **G: Analytical use** involves breaking down concepts, irrelevant here.
- **H: Semantic use** pertains to meaning in general, not specifically emotive meaning.
- **I: Constructive use** and **J: Pragmatic use** are unrelated to the emotive aspect.

Stevenson's emphasis on the emotive meaning of "good" as expressing approval or positive attitudes makes **E: expressive use** the most fitting answer.
