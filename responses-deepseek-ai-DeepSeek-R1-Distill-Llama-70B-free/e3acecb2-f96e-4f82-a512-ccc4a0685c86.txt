Okay, so I've got this problem here about discounting a draft, and I need to find the proceeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my finance calculations, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the draft is for $350, dated October 15, and it's due in 60 days. So that means the due date is November 14th, right? Because October has 31 days, so from October 15 to October 31 is 16 days, plus 44 days in November gets us to November 14. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, 60 days from October 15 would be... let's see. October has 31 days, so 31 minus 15 is 16 days left in October. Then 60 minus 16 is 44 days into November. So the due date is November 14th.

But the draft is being discounted on November 12. So that's two days before it's due. So the time remaining until maturity is 2 days. Oh wait, no, wait. Because from October 15 to November 14 is 30 days? No, October has 31 days, so from Oct 15 to Oct 31 is 16 days, then November 14 is day 44, which is 16 + 44 = 60 days total. So when it's discounted on Nov 12, how many days are left? From Nov 12 to Nov 14 is 2 days. So the time is 2 days.

Wait, but wait! When calculating the discount, do we count the days as 360 or 365? Oh right, in some financial calculations, they use 360 days a year, called the banker's year. So I think for discounting, it's typically 360 days.

So the formula for the discount is: discount = (face value) * (rate) * (time in years). Then proceeds are face value minus discount.

Time here is the number of days remaining, which is 2 days. So time in years is 2/360.

Then the discount rate is 5%, so 0.05. But wait, there's also a collection fee of (1/5)%, which is 0.2%. So the total discount rate is 5% + 0.2% = 5.2%, right? Or is the collection fee separate?

Wait, maybe I should think again. Collection fee is a fee charged by the bank for handling the collection. So perhaps it's a flat fee based on the face value. Or is it a percentage? The problem says collection fee of (1/5)%, so that's 0.2% of the face value. So the total discount would be the interest plus the collection fee.

Alternatively, perhaps the total discount is the sum of the interest and the fee. So proceeds = face value - discount - fee.

Wait, let's clarify:

When a draft is discounted, the bank charges a discount which is based on the interest for the time remaining plus any fees. So the discount is calculated as face value multiplied by the discount rate multiplied by the time. Then the proceeds are face value minus this discount. Additionally, there's a collection fee, which is also subtracted from the proceeds.

Wait, but in this problem, the collection fee is (1/5)%, which is 0.2%. So perhaps the total discount is the interest plus the fee.

So the total discount rate would be 5% + 0.2% = 5.2% per annum.

Alternatively, maybe the collection fee is calculated separately. So the discount is face * (rate * time), and the fee is face * (0.2% per annum * time), then total discount is sum of both.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about it step by step.

The discount is calculated as the interest on the draft. So the interest is principal × rate × time. The collection fee is another charge, perhaps a flat fee or percentage.

But the way the question is worded: "discounted at 5% with collection fee of (1/5)%". So maybe the 5% is the discount rate, and the collection fee is 0.2% of the face value.

Wait, that could make sense. So discount is 5% per annum, time is 2 days. Then the interest is 350 * 0.05 * (2/360). Then the collection fee is 350 * 0.002 (since 1/5% is 0.2%)? Or is the collection fee also based on the time? Hmm.

Wait, the collection fee is probably a flat fee based on the face value, not time. Because it's a fee for handling, so it's just a percentage of the face amount.

So in that case, the discount (interest) would be 350 * 5% * (2/360). Then the proceeds would be 350 minus discount minus collection fee.

Let me compute each part.

First, calculate the discount (interest):

Time in years = 2/360.

So discount = 350 * 0.05 * (2/360).

Let me compute that:

0.05 * 2 = 0.10.

0.10 / 360 = approximately 0.000277777...

Multiply by 350: 350 * 0.000277777 = approx 0.097222...

So about $0.0972, which is roughly 9.72 cents. So approximately $0.0972.

Then the collection fee is 1/5% of the face value. 1/5% is 0.2%, so 0.002 multiplied by 350.

350 * 0.002 = 0.7.

So collection fee is $0.70.

So total deductions from the face value would be discount (≈0.0972) + collection fee (0.70).

So total deduction is 0.7972.

Proceeds = 350 - 0.7972 = 349.2028.

Looking at the options, the closest one is C: $349.00. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 350.00

B: 347.00

C: 349.00

D: 347.74

E: 349.50

F: 346.25

G: 345.00

H: 346.50

I: 348.00

J: 348.50

So 349.20 is not among the options. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is applied per annum as well. Let me think again.

If the collection fee is (1/5)% per annum, then collection fee would be 350 * 0.002 * (2/360).

So let me recalculate.

Discount (interest) = 350 * 0.05 * (2/360) = 350 * 0.000277777... = 0.097222...

Collection fee = 350 * 0.002 * (2/360) = 350 * 0.000011111... = 0.0038888...

So total discount is 0.097222 + 0.0038888 ≈ 0.101111.

Proceeds = 350 - 0.101111 ≈ 349.8988, which is approximately $349.90.

But that's not matching any of the options either. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the collection fee is applied.

Alternative approach: Maybe the discount rate includes both the interest and the collection fee.

So the total discount rate is 5% + 0.2% = 5.2%.

Then the discount is 350 * 5.2% * (2/360).

Compute that:

5.2% is 0.052.

Time is 2/360 = 1/180 ≈ 0.0055555.

So 0.052 * 0.0055555 ≈ 0.00028888...

Multiply by 350: 350 * 0.00028888 ≈ 0.10111.

Proceeds = 350 - 0.10111 ≈ 349.8988. So $349.90, which again isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps the collection fee is treated as a flat fee, not based on time.

So discount is 350 * 5% * (2/360) = ~0.0972.

Collection fee is 350 * 0.2% = 0.7.

Total deduction is 0.0972 + 0.7 = 0.7972.

Proceeds = 350 - 0.7972 = 349.2028, which is approximately $349.20.

Looking at the options, option E is $349.50, which is close but not exact. Option C is $349.00.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.

Compute the discount exactly:

350 * 0.05 * (2/360) = 350 * 0.05 * (1/180).

0.05 is 5/100, so 350 * 5/(100 * 180) = (350 * 5) / 18000.

350 *5 = 1750.

1750 / 18000 = 0.097222...

So discount is exactly $0.097222.

Collection fee is (1/5)% of 350. (1/5)% is 0.2%, so 0.002 * 350 = 0.7.

So total deduction is 0.097222 + 0.7 = 0.797222.

Proceeds = 350 - 0.797222 = 349.202778.

So $349.202778, which is approximately $349.20. Looking at the options, the closest is option E: $349.50, but that's higher. Option C is $349.00, which is lower.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in how the time is calculated. Let me double-check the days.

The draft is dated October 15, due in 60 days. So due date is November 14.

It's discounted on November 12.

So from November 12 to November 14 is 2 days.

So time remaining is 2 days. So 2/360 years.

Wait, but in some cases, when calculating interest, the day of discounting is counted as day 0, and the next day is day 1. So when you discount on the 12th, the 14th is two days later: the 13th is 1 day, and the 14th is 2 days.

So time is 2 days.

Alternatively, sometimes in banking, the formula is (D - d)/360, where D is due date and d is discount date. So same as 2 days.

So that part's correct.

Wait, perhaps the discount is calculated without subtracting the collection fee from the proceeds. Let me think: the proceeds are the amount the seller receives after the discount and fees.

So proceeds = face value - discount - collection fee.

Which is what I did earlier.

Hmm. But the options don't include $349.20. Let me check if I made a calculation mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is calculated on the discounted amount, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the collection fee is a flat fee, so 0.2% of the face value, which is $0.70, and the discount is 5% per annum on the face value for the time period.

So discount = 350 * 0.05 * (2/360) = 0.097222...

Collection fee = 0.70.

So proceeds = 350 - 0.097222 - 0.70 = 349.202777...

Which is approximately $349.20.

Looking at the options, the closest option is E: $349.50, but that's 30 cents higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using 365 days instead of 360. Let me try that.

Time in years = 2/365 ≈ 0.005479.

Discount = 350 * 0.05 * 0.005479 ≈ 350 * 0.00027395 ≈ 0.09583.

Collection fee is 0.70.

Total deduction: 0.09583 +0.70= 0.79583.

Proceeds: 350 - 0.79583 = 349.204166...

Still about $349.20.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is (1/5)% of the proceeds, not the face value. Let me try that.

So proceeds = face value - discount - (collection fee as a percentage of proceeds).

Wait, but that would be more complicated because the collection fee would be based on the proceeds, which depends on the discount. So it's a bit of a loop.

Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is a flat fee, say, a certain amount per draft, but the problem states it's (1/5)% so likely a percentage.

Wait, maybe the collection fee is applied to the discounted amount. So:

Proceeds = (face value - discount) - (collection fee on (face value - discount)).

So, discount is 350 * 0.05 * (2/360) = 0.097222.

So discounted amount before fee is 350 - 0.097222 ≈ 349.902778.

Then collection fee is 0.2% of that, which is 349.902778 * 0.002 ≈ 0.6998.

So total proceeds would be 349.902778 - 0.6998 ≈ 349.203.

Again, around $349.20.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking back, option E is $349.50, which is higher than my calculation. Option I is $348.00, which is lower.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the discount rate is 5%, but the collection fee is 1/5%, so total discount is 5% + 0.2% = 5.2% per annum.

So discount = 350 * 0.052 * (2/360).

Compute that:

0.052 * 2 = 0.104.

0.104 / 360 ≈ 0.00028888...

350 * 0.00028888 ≈ 0.10111.

Proceeds = 350 - 0.10111 ≈ 349.8988.

Again, $349.89, which isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is not based on time. So collection fee is 0.2% of face value, which is 0.70.

Discount is 5% per annum for 2 days: 350 * 0.05 * (2/360) = 0.097222.

Total deduction: 0.70 + 0.097222 = 0.797222.

Proceeds: 350 - 0.797222 = 349.2027, so approximately $349.20.

But again, the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the due date is calculated differently. Let me recount the days.

Draft dated October 15, due in 60 days.

October has 31 days, so from October 15 to October 31 is 16 days (including the 15th?), wait, no: from the 15th to the 31st is 16 days? Let's count: October 15 is day 0, 16 is day 1, up to 31 being day 16. So 16 days.

Then 60 days total: 16 days in October, so remaining days in November: 60-16=44 days.

So November has 30 days, so 44 days would be November 1 to November 43? Wait, no, November only has 30 days. Wait, no, wait: 44 days after October 15 would be:

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the due date correctly.

October 15 plus 60 days.

October has 31 days. So from October 15, the remaining days in October are 31 -15 =16 days.

So 60 days would be October 16 to October 31: 16 days. Then, the remaining 60-16=44 days are in November.

November has 30 days, so 44 days into November is November 30 plus 14 days, which would be December 14. Wait, that can't be right because the draft is due in 60 days, which would be in November, not December.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the due date.

If the draft is dated October 15 and due in 60 days.

October 15 (day 0).

From October 16 to October 31: 16 days.

That leaves 60 -16=44 days.

November has 30 days, so 44-30=14 days into December.

So due date is December 14.

Wait, that changes things. So the due date is December 14, not November 14.

So when the draft is discounted on November 12, how many days are remaining?

From November 12 to December 14: November has 30 days, so November 12 to November 30 is 18 days (including the 12th?), wait no, the 12th is day 0, so 30-12=18 days remaining in November.

Then 18 +14 days in December (from Dec 1 to Dec14) = 32 days.

So total days remaining: 32 days.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, from Nov 12 to Dec 14.

November 12 to November 30: 19 days (including the 12th and 30th? Or not?)

Wait, perhaps better to count: November has 30 days.

From Nov 12 to Nov 30 is 30 -12 =18 days (since Nov 12 is counted as day 0, so 18 days remaining in Nov after the 12th).

Then December 1 to December 14: 14 days.

So total time remaining is 18 +14 =32 days.

So time in years is 32/360.

Ah, that's different from before. So I think I made a mistake earlier about the due date.

So that changes the calculation.

So now, time is 32 days.

So discount = 350 * 5% * (32/360).

Compute that:

5% is 0.05.

32/360 = 8/90 ≈ 0.088888.

0.05 * 0.088888 ≈ 0.0044444.

Multiply by 350: 350 * 0.0044444 ≈ 1.5555.

So discount is approximately $1.5555.

Then collection fee is (1/5)% of face value, which is 0.2% of 350 = 0.7.

So total deduction is 1.5555 +0.7 =2.2555.

Proceeds = 350 -2.2555 ≈
