Okay, so I've got this question about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Given a color image of size 28x28x3 pixels, how many convolutional filters are in the first layer if the output tensor is 26x26x64?

Hmm, right. So I remember that in CNNs, the first layer usually consists of multiple filters that slide over the input image to detect features. Each filter produces a feature map. The output of the convolutional layer has a certain depth, which is equal to the number of filters used because each filter contributes one feature map.

Wait, so the output tensor here is 26x26x64. That means the spatial dimensions are 26x26, and the depth is 64. So the number of filters should be 64, right? Because each filter produces one channel in the output.

But wait, let me think again. The input is 28x28x3. So the image has 3 channels (like RGB). When you apply a filter to it, each filter has a depth equal to the number of input channels. So each filter is 3xkxk, maybe (where k is the size like 3x3 or 5x5). But the number of filters determines how many feature maps are created, each of which is a 2D map.

So the output depth is the number of filters. So here, the output depth is 64, which suggests there are 64 filters in the first layer.

Wait, but the options have 64 as option D. But I see another point: the spatial size changes. The input is 28x28, and the output is 26x26. So how does that happen? Oh, right, because of the filter size and the stride. Usually, if the filter is size F, and the stride is S, then the output size is (W - F + 1)/S.

Assuming the stride is 1 (since the question doesn't mention anything else), then 28 - F +1 =26 → F=3. So the filter size is 3x3.

But that probably doesn't affect the number of filters. So the number of filters is 64, so the answer should be D:64.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. Let me think about the formula for the output volume.

The formula is:

output_height = (input_height - filter_height) / stride + 1

Similarly for width. Since the input is 28, output is 26, and if stride is 1, then 28 - F +1 =26 → F=3.

So each filter is 3x3x3 (since input has 3 channels). The number of filters is 64, which becomes the depth of the output.

So yes, the answer should be D:64.

To determine the number of convolutional filters in the first layer of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we analyze the given input and output dimensions. The input image has a size of 28x28x3, indicating a spatial resolution of 28x28 and 3 color channels. The output tensor from the first layer is 26x26x64, where 26x26 is the spatial resolution, and 64 is the depth (number of feature maps).

In a CNN, the depth of the output tensor corresponds to the number of filters used in the convolutional layer. Each filter processes the input to produce one feature map. Therefore, the depth of the output tensor (64) directly indicates the number of filters in the first layer.

Additionally, the spatial dimensions of the output tensor (26x26) can be explained by the filter size and stride. If we assume a stride of 1, the filter size can be calculated as:

\[
\text{output\_height} = \frac{\text{input\_height} - \text{filter\_height} + 1}{\text{stride}}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
26 = \frac{28 - F + 1}{1} \implies F = 3
\]

Thus, each filter is 3x3x3 (matching the input depth of 3). However, this detail does not affect the number of filters, which is determined solely by the output depth of 64.

The number of filters in the first layer is therefore **64**.
