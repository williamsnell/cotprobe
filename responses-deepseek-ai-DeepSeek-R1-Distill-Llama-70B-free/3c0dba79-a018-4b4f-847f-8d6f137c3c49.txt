Okay, so I've got this physics question about uniform circular motion, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is which of the options A to I is true regarding uniform circular motion. Hmm. I remember that uniform circular motion means the object is moving in a circle at a constant speed. But wait, even though the speed is constant, the velocity isn't because velocity is a vector and depends on direction. So the direction of the velocity is constantly changing as the object moves around the circle.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: A satellite undergoing uniform circular motion is falling toward the center in a circular path. I think this is about gravity providing the centripetal force. Satellites are in orbit because they're essentially in free fall towards Earth, but their tangential velocity makes them miss the Earth, so they keep moving in a circular path. So A sounds correct. But wait, let me keep going to check other options.

Option B: The centripetal acceleration and velocity point in the same direction. Centripetal acceleration is towards the center of the circle, right? Velocity is tangential, so at any point, the velocity is perpendicular to the radius. So their directions are perpendicular, not the same. So B is wrong.

Option C: The centripetal acceleration and velocity point in opposite directions. Wait, no. Like I just thought, they are perpendicular. So if velocity is to the east, acceleration is north or south. So they aren't opposite. So C is incorrect.

Option D: The acceleration of the object in motion changes whereas the velocity is constant. Wait, velocity isn't constant because direction changes. So the velocity isn't constant, but the speed is. But acceleration is also changing because its direction is always towards the center, so as the object moves, the direction changes. Wait, but in uniform circular motion, the magnitude of acceleration (centripetal) is constant. So D says acceleration changes (which is true because direction changes) and velocity is constant (false). So D is incorrect.

Option E: The centrifugal force and the centripetal force cancel each other out. Hmm. Wait, in physics, centrifugal force is a fictitious force that appears in rotating frames. In an inertial frame, there is no centrifugal force. So in uniform circular motion, centripetal force is provided by something like gravity or tension, and there's no centrifugal force in that frame. So E is incorrect because centrifugal isn't a real force here, so they don't cancel. Also, even if considering a rotating frame, the object experiences a centrifugal outward force, but in reality, centripetal is the net force towards the center. So E isn't correct.

Option F: The centrifugal force is greater than the centripetal. Again, in the inertial frame, there's no centrifugal force. So F isn't correct.

Option G: Satellite is moving away from the center. No, satellites in orbit are pulled towards the center by gravity. They're in free fall but moving sideways, so they don't move away. So G is wrong.

Option H: Centripetal force in same direction as velocity. No, centripetal force is towards the center, velocity is tangential. So H is wrong because their directions are perpendicular, not same.

Option I: Centrifugal force is the action-reaction pair of centripetal. Wait, action-reaction pairs are between two different objects. For example, the Earth pulls on the satellite (centripetal), and the satellite pulls on Earth. But centrifugal is a fictitious force, so it can't be the action-reaction. So I is incorrect.

Wait, back to option A. Satellites are indeed in free fall. They're falling towards Earth but because they have a tangential velocity, they keep orbiting. So in a way, they are continuously falling towards the center, which is why they move in a circular path. So A seems correct.

Wait, what about D again? It said the acceleration changes, which is true because the direction of acceleration (centripetal) is always towards the center, so as the object moves, the direction changes. So the acceleration is changing. But the velocity is not constant. So D says "the acceleration of the object in motion changes whereas the velocity is constant." Wait, velocity isn't constant because direction changes. So D is incorrect.

So from all that, the correct answer should be A.

To determine which statement about uniform circular motion is true, let us analyze each option:

- **Option A**: A satellite undergoing uniform circular motion is falling toward the center in a circular path. This is correct. Satellites are in free fall due to gravity, but their tangential velocity causes them to follow a circular path instead of falling directly toward the center.

- **Option B**: The centripetal acceleration and velocity point in the same direction. This is incorrect. Centripetal acceleration is always directed toward the center of the circle, while velocity is tangential to the circle. Their directions are perpendicular, not the same.

- **Option C**: The centripetal acceleration and velocity point in opposite directions. This is also incorrect. While centripetal acceleration is directed toward the center, velocity is tangential, so their directions are neither opposite nor the sameâ€”they are perpendicular.

- **Option D**: The acceleration of the object in motion changes whereas the velocity is constant. This is incorrect. While the direction of acceleration (centripetal) changes as the object moves, its magnitude remains constant. Additionally, velocity is not constant because its direction changes continuously.

- **Option E**: The centrifugal force and the centripetal force cancel each other out in uniform circular motion. This is incorrect. Centrifugal force is a fictitious force that appears only in rotating frames of reference. In an inertial frame, there is no centrifugal force, so they cannot cancel each other out.

- **Option F**: The centrifugal force is greater than the centripetal force in uniform circular motion. This is incorrect. In an inertial frame, centrifugal force does not exist, so this comparison is invalid.

- **Option G**: A satellite undergoing uniform circular motion is moving away from the center in a circular path. This is incorrect. Satellites are pulled toward the center by forces like gravity, and their motion is constrained to a circular path.

- **Option H**: The centripetal force acts in the same direction as the velocity. This is incorrect. Centripetal force is directed toward the center of the circle, while velocity is tangential, so their directions are perpendicular.

- **Option I**: The centrifugal force is the action-reaction pair of the centripetal force. This is incorrect. Centrifugal force is a fictitious force and cannot be part of an action-reaction pair. The centripetal force and the reaction force involve two different objects.

From this analysis, the correct answer is **A**, as it accurately describes the motion of a satellite in uniform circular motion.
