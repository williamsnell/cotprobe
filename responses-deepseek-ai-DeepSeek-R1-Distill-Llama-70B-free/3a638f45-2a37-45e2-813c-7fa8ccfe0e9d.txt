Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the sequence y[n] recursively. The initial conditions are y[1] = 3 and y[0] = 2. The recurrence relation is y[n] - 3y[n-1] + 2y[n-2] = 0 for n ≥ 2. And there are four options to choose from: A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember from my classes that solving linear recurrence relations involves finding the characteristic equation. Let me try that approach. So the given recurrence is homogeneous and linear with constant coefficients. The standard method is to assume a solution of the form y[n] = r^n.

Substituting y[n] = r^n into the recurrence gives me:

r^n - 3r^(n-1) + 2r^(n-2) = 0.

If I factor out r^(n-2), I get r^(n-2)(r^2 - 3r + 2) = 0. Since r can't be zero, the equation simplifies to the characteristic equation: r^2 - 3r + 2 = 0.

Now, solving this quadratic equation. The discriminant is (3)^2 - 4*1*2 = 9 - 8 = 1. So the roots are r = [3 ± sqrt(1)] / 2, which gives r = (3+1)/2 = 2 and r = (3-1)/2 = 1. So the roots are 2 and 1.

The general solution for the recurrence is then a combination of these roots: y[n] = A*(2)^n + B*(1)^n, where A and B are constants determined by the initial conditions.

Wait, but wait. The initial conditions given are y[0] and y[1]. Let me plug those in to find A and B.

For n=0: y[0] = A*2^0 + B*1^0 → 2 = A + B.

For n=1: y[1] = A*2^1 + B*1^1 → 3 = 2A + B.

Now I have a system of two equations:

1. A + B = 2
2. 2A + B = 3

Subtracting the first equation from the second: (2A + B) - (A + B) = 3 - 2 → A = 1.

Substituting A=1 into the first equation: 1 + B = 2 → B=1.

So the general solution is y[n] = 1*(2)^n + 1*(1)^n = 2^n + 1.

Wait a minute, let me double-check that. If n=0, 2^0 +1=1+1=2, which matches y[0]=2. For n=1, 2^1 +1=2+1=3, which matches y[1]=3. Then for n=2, y[2] = 2^2 +1=4+1=5. For n=3, 8+1=9. n=4, 16+1=17. So the sequence goes y[0]=2, y[1]=3, y[2]=5, y[3]=9, y[4]=17, and so on.

Looking at the options, each option lists the sequence starting presumably from n=2 onwards, but let's check each option.

Option A: y[n] = 5,9,15,... for n≥2. Wait, y[2]=5, y[3]=9, but y[4]=17, not 15. So option A is wrong because the next term after 9 should be 17, not 15.

Option B: 5,9,17,... which matches what I have. So for n=2, it's 5, n=3=9, n=4=17. So option B seems correct.

Option C: starts with 2,5,9... but the question is asking for the sequence starting from n=2, I think. Wait, the options probably describe y[n] for n≥2, but let me read the options again.

Wait, looking back, the options are written as y[n] = 5,9,15,...; n >=2, etc. So each option starts at n=2. So for option B, the terms are 5,9,17,... which matches our calculation.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Alternatively, let's compute a few more terms just to be sure. n=2: 5, n=3:9, n=4:17, n=5: 33. So the sequence is 5,9,17,33,...

Looking at the options again:

A: 5,9,15 → next term is 15, which doesn't match 17. So A is wrong.

B: 5,9,17 → correct.

C: starts with 2,5,9. But for n>=2, y[2]=5, y[3]=9, y[4]=17. So C starts at n=0 perhaps. But the option says n>=2, so the first term is y[2]=5, but option C's first term is 2, which would be y[0]. So C is incorrect.

D: 3,5,9... But for n=2, y[2]=5, not 3. So D starts with 3, which is y[1], so that doesn't fit.

So yes, the correct answer is option B.

To solve the recurrence relation \( y[n] - 3y[n-1] + 2y[n-2] = 0 \) with initial conditions \( y[0] = 2 \) and \( y[1] = 3 \), we start by assuming a solution of the form \( y[n] = r^n \). Substituting this into the recurrence relation gives the characteristic equation:

\[
r^2 - 3r + 2 = 0.
\]

Solving this quadratic equation, the roots are \( r = 2 \) and \( r = 1 \). Thus, the general solution is:

\[
y[n] = A \cdot 2^n + B \cdot 1^n,
\]

where \( A \) and \( B \) are constants determined by the initial conditions. Using \( y[0] = 2 \), we get:

\[
2 = A + B.
\]

Using \( y[1] = 3 \), we get:

\[
3 = 2A + B.
\]

Solving this system of equations, we find \( A = 1 \) and \( B = 1 \). Therefore, the solution is:

\[
y[n] = 2^n + 1.
\]

Now, we compute the sequence for \( n \geq 2 \):

- For \( n = 2 \): \( y[2] = 2^2 + 1 = 5 \),
- For \( n = 3 \): \( y[3] = 2^3 + 1 = 9 \),
- For \( n = 4 \): \( y[4] = 2^4 + 1 = 17 \),
- For \( n = 5 \): \( y[5] = 2^5 + 1 = 33 \), and so on.

Thus, the sequence for \( n \geq 2 \) is \( 5, 9, 17, 33, \dots \).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \( y[n] = 5, 9, 15, \dots \) is incorrect because the next term after 9 is 17, not 15.
- **Option B**: \( y[n] = 5, 9, 17, \dots \) matches the computed sequence and is correct.
- **Option C**: \( y[n] = 2, 5, 9, \dots \) is incorrect because the sequence starts at \( n = 2 \), where \( y[2] = 5 \), not 2.
- **Option D**: \( y[n] = 3, 5, 9, \dots \) is incorrect because \( y[2] = 5 \), not 3.

The correct answer is **Option B**.
