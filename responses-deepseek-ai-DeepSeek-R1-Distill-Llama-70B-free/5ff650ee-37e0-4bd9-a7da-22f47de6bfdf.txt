Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two traveling waves superimposing. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on wave interference, but let's see if I can think this through.

The question states that two waves of equal frequency are traveling in the same medium and superimpose. One has an amplitude of 4 cm, the other 6 cm. We need to find the displacement D of the resultant wave from the options given.

Wait, when two waves superimpose, the result depends on their phase difference. Oh right, interference! So the resultant displacement depends on whether they interfere constructively or destructively.

In constructive interference, the two waves add up so their amplitudes add. So 4 cm plus 6 cm would give 10 cm. That's the maximum possible displacement. But what if they interfere destructively? Then the amplitudes subtract. So 6 cm minus 4 cm is 2 cm. Oh wait, but wait, which one is bigger? So does the smaller subtract from the larger, so 6-4 is 2 cm. So the minimum displacement would be 2 cm.

Wait, but wait again. The formula for the resultant amplitude when two waves interfere is a bit more precise. The maximum is A1 + A2, and the minimum is |A1 - A2|. So yes, in this case, 4+6=10 cm max, 6-4=2 cm min. So the resultant amplitude varies between 2 cm and 10 cm depending on the phase difference.

But the question is about the displacement D of the resultant wave. Wait, displacement here probably refers to the amplitude of the resultant wave, right? Because the displacement in waves is usually the amplitude unless specified otherwise.

So the possible values of D would range from 2 cm to 10 cm. Looking at the options, option F says 2 cm ≤ D ≤10 cm. That fits.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. The problem says they're traveling waves superimposing in the same medium. So they could be traveling in the same direction or opposite? Oh wait, the question doesn't specify that. Wait, but if they're traveling in opposite directions, that's standing waves, but the problem says they are traveling waves. Oh, wait, no, two traveling waves can interfere whether moving in the same or opposite directions, but the result is a new traveling wave.

Wait, no, when two waves of the same frequency and speed (so same medium) traveling in the same direction interfere, you get a resultant wave whose amplitude depends on their phase difference. If they're in phase, max amplitude; if out of phase, min amplitude. So the resultant wave's amplitude will vary between 2 and 10 cm.

So looking back at the options, option F is 2 cm ≤ D ≤10 cm, which matches this range. So the correct answer should be F.

When two traveling waves of equal frequency superimpose in the same medium, the displacement \( D \) of the resultant wave depends on the phase difference between the two waves. If the waves interfere constructively (in phase), their amplitudes add, resulting in a maximum displacement of \( 4 \, \text{cm} + 6 \, \text{cm} = 10 \, \text{cm} \). If the waves interfere destructively (out of phase), their amplitudes subtract, resulting in a minimum displacement of \( |6 \, \text{cm} - 4 \, \text{cm}| = 2 \, \text{cm} \).

Thus, the displacement \( D \) of the resultant wave can vary between \( 2 \, \text{cm} \) and \( 10 \, \text{cm} \), depending on the phase relationship between the two waves. Among the given options, the one that correctly describes this range is:

**F: \( 2 \, \text{cm} \leq D \leq 10 \, \text{cm} \).**

Answer: F
