Okay, so I've got this question about Underdog's archenemy. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with Underdog, but I'll try to think it through. Underdog is a cartoon superhero, right? I remember he's a dog with superpowers, and he's kind of a classic character from older cartoons.

The question is asking who his archenemy is, and the options are A to J. Let me go through each option and see which one fits.

Option A: Shredder. I think Shredder is from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. He's the leader of the Foot Clan, so probably not Underdog's enemy.

Option B: Captain Hook. Oh, wait, Captain Hook is from Peter Pan. He's the pirate who lost his hand to a crocodile. But does he have any connection to Underdog? I don't think so.

Option C: Dick Dastardly. Now, this name sounds familiar. I believe Dick Dastardly is a villain from another cartoon. Wasn't he in a show with a dog as the hero? Oh wait, maybe he's from "Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines." That's a Hanna-Barbera show, I think. And Underdog is also a Hanna-Barbera character. So maybe there's a connection here.

Option D: Dr. Doom. He's a Marvel villain, right? Like from the Fantastic Four comics. Definitely not related to Underdog.

Option E: OverCat. Doesn't ring a bell. Maybe a newer character or from a different show.

Option F: Riddler. He's Batman's enemy, famous for his riddles. Not connected to Underdog.

Option G: Mr. Whoopie. I don't recognize this name at all. Maybe a minor character or from another show.

Option H: Muttley. Oh, Muttley is a character I've heard of. He's a dog, isn't he? And I think he's the sidekick to Dick Dastardly. Wait, so if Dick Dastardly is the main villain, then Muttley is his partner. But the question is asking for the archenemy, so maybe C is the answer, not H.

Option I: Lex Luthor. Superman's archenemy. Not related to Underdog.

Option J: Joker. Batman's enemy. Again, no connection.

So putting it all together, the main villain for Underdog is probably Dick Dastardly. I think Underdog's show had various villains, but Dick Dastardly was a recurring one. He's the one who comes up with schemes, and Underdog always thwarts him. Muttley is his sidekick, so H is Muttley, but the question is about the archenemy, which would be Dick Dastardly, option C.
