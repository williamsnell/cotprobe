Question:

A devastating earthquake struck a foreign country. The earthquake destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings. Thousands of residents were killed, injured, and left homeless by the earthquake. The leader of the foreign country sought the assistance of the United States in providing emergency aid. The President initially wanted to send troops from a west coast military base but learned that they were out on training maneuvers. As a result, the President issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the supervision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to travel to the foreign country to engage in emergency rescue operations. This federal agency's main function is to patrol the borders to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States. A member of this federal agency refused to comply with the executive order and assist in the relief effort. He claimed that participating in such operations in a foreign country is beyond the scope of his job responsibilities. He brought suit in federal court challenging the validity of the President's executive order. Assuming the member of the federal agency has adequate standing, the court should rule the executive order

Options:

A: valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.
B: valid, because the President can repurpose federal agencies for emergency relief efforts.
C: invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.
D: invalid, because the executive order did not specify the scope of the relief operations.
E: invalid, because the executive order infringes upon the rights of federal employees.
F: invalid, because the INS does not have jurisdiction in foreign countries.
G: valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.
H: valid, because the president's executive power extends to directing federal agencies in times of crisis.
I: valid, because the President has the power to issue executive orders in times of emergency.
J: invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the President's executive order and whether it's valid or not. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is that a devastating earthquake hit a foreign country, and their leader asked the U.S. for help. The President wanted to send troops from a west coast base, but they were out on training. So instead, he issued an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the INS to go assist in the emergency rescue.

Wait, the agency's main job is patrolling borders to prevent illegal entry. So a member refused, saying it's beyond his job. He's suing, and the question is whether the court should find the order valid or invalid.

Alright, so I need to figure out the legal reasoning here. Let's think about presidential powers. The President has various powers under the Constitution, including being the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. But this isn't about the military; it's about a federal agency under INS.

So, can the President redirect federal employees from their usual duties to an emergency abroad? Well, I remember that the President has broad authority in foreign affairs, but Congress also plays a role. So maybe it's about whether the President can unilaterally assign new duties without Congressional approval.

The agency in question is under the INS, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security these days, but in older contexts, maybe under Justice? Either way, their main job is border patrol. So the President is ordering them to do something outside their usual role.

I think there's a principle that the President can direct federal agencies as part of his executive power, but there might be limits. For example, can the President assign duties that are outside the agency's statutory authority? Because if Congress created the agency for a specific purpose, the President might not have the authority to change that without Congress.

So the member is arguing that it's beyond his job responsibilities. That probably relates to whether the President's order is within his constitutional authority. If the agency's enabling statute doesn't allow for such operations, the President might be overstepping.

Wait, but the President is the head of the executive branch. So under the Take Care Clause, he must ensure that the laws are faithfully executed. But does that give him the power to repurpose agencies in emergencies? Or does that require Congressional authorization?

Also, think about Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, where the Supreme Court ruled that the President couldn't seize steel mills without Congressional authority, even during the Korean War. That case emphasized that the President's authority isn't unlimited and that Congressional authorization is needed for certain actions.

In this case, the President is directing an agency to perform a rescue mission abroad. If Congress hasn't authorized this kind of action, especially using agencies outside their intended scope, the executive order could be invalid.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the order is invalid because it's beyond presidential power without Congressional authorization. That sounds like it's citing the same principle as Youngstown.

Option B says the President can repurpose federal agencies for emergencies. But I'm not sure if that's the case without Congress.

Option G says employees can be required to perform emergency functions. But the issue is whether the President has the authority to assign such functions.

Option F says it's invalid because INS doesn't have jurisdiction abroad. That's a different point. INS (now part of DHS) deals with internal enforcement, not foreign operations. But the President's order is about sending them abroad, which might be beyond their authority. So F could be a contender.

But wait, the main issue is the scope of presidential power. The question is whether the President can assign new duties without Congress. So option C seems more about the President's authority, while F is about the agency's jurisdiction.

I think the key point is whether the President can redirect an agency's mission without Congressional approval. If the agency's statute doesn't allow for foreign operations, then the President's order would be beyond his power. So option C would be correct.

Alternatively, if the President's executive power allows him to direct agencies in emergencies, then option B or H might be valid. But I think the Supreme Court would require Congressional authorization for such a significant shift.

So the answer is probably option C: invalid, because the order is beyond presidential power without Congress.

The question revolves around whether the President's executive order directing a federal agency under the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to engage in emergency rescue operations abroad is valid. The agency's primary role is border patrol, and the President's order redirects its employees to perform duties outside their usual scope. The key issue is whether the President has the authority to unilaterally repurpose a federal agency for foreign emergency operations without Congressional authorization.

The President's authority is broad, particularly in foreign affairs, but it is not unlimited. The Supreme Court's decision in *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer* established that the President cannot act without Congressional authorization when it comes to significant expansions of executive power. In this case, the agency's enabling statute likely limits its role to domestic border enforcement, and redirecting it to foreign operations would require Congressional approval. Without such authorization, the President's executive order exceeds his constitutional authority.

While other options, such as the President's ability to repurpose agencies in emergencies (Option B) or the agency's lack of jurisdiction abroad (Option F), are relevant, the central issue is the President's authority to act without Congressional backing. Therefore, the executive order is invalid because it exceeds the scope of presidential power absent Congressional authorization.

Answer: C
