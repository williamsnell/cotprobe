Okay, so I've got this problem here about inequalities and points. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which point is NOT a solution to both inequalities y > 9x - 8 and y < -x + 8. So, I need to check each option and see if it satisfies both inequalities. The one that doesn't satisfy both is the answer.

Let me first write down the inequalities:

1. y > 9x - 8
2. y < -x + 8

So for each point (x, y), I'll plug in the x and y values into both inequalities and see if they hold true.

Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A: (-2, 15)
First inequality: y > 9x -8
x is -2, so 9*(-2) = -18. Then -18 -8 = -26. So y must be greater than -26. Since y is 15, which is definitely greater than -26, the first condition holds.

Second inequality: y < -x +8
x is -2, so -(-2) is 2. 2 +8 =10. So y must be less than 10. But y here is 15, which is not less than 10. So this point doesn't satisfy the second inequality. So it's not a solution to both. Wait, but I need to find the point that is NOT a solution to both. Hmm, but wait, the question is which point is NOT a solution to both. So if a point doesn't satisfy both, it's a candidate. So option A could be the answer, but let me check others to be sure.

Option B: (-1, 5)
First inequality: y >9*(-1) -8 → y> -9-8= -17. 5 is greater than -17, so that's good.

Second inequality: y < -(-1) +8 → y < 1 +8=9. 5 is less than 9, so this satisfies both. So it's a solution to both, so not the answer.

Option C: (-2, -8)
First inequality: y>9*(-2) -8 = -18-8= -26. So y must be > -26. y is -8, which is greater than -26. So first condition holds.

Second inequality: y < -(-2) +8 → 2+8=10. So y must be <10. -8 is less than 10, so it satisfies both. So option C is a solution to both. Not the answer.

Option D: (0, 0)
First inequality: y>9*0 -8 → y> -8. 0 is greater than -8, so yes.

Second inequality: y < -0 +8 → y <8. 0 is less than 8, so yes. So satisfies both. Not the answer.

Option E: (1,5)
First inequality: y>9*1 -8=9-8=1. So y>1. 5>1, so yes.

Second inequality: y < -1 +8=7. 5 is less than 7, so yes. So satisfies both. Not the answer.

Option F: (-1, -1)
First inequality: y>9*(-1) -8 → y> -9-8= -17. -1 is greater than -17, so yes.

Second inequality: y < -(-1) +8 → 1+8=9. -1 is less than 9, so yes. So this also satisfies both. So not the answer.

Wait, so the only point that didn't satisfy both was option A, because it failed the second inequality. So the question is which point is NOT a solution to both. So option A is the correct answer.

To determine which point is NOT a solution to both inequalities \( y > 9x - 8 \) and \( y < -x + 8 \), we evaluate each option:

1. **Option A: \((-2, 15)\)**  
   - First inequality: \( y > 9(-2) - 8 = -26 \). Since \( 15 > -26 \), this holds.  
   - Second inequality: \( y < -(-2) + 8 = 10 \). Since \( 15 \not< 10 \), this does not hold.  
   **Conclusion:** Does not satisfy both inequalities.

2. **Option B: \((-1, 5)\)**  
   - First inequality: \( y > 9(-1) - 8 = -17 \). Since \( 5 > -17 \), this holds.  
   - Second inequality: \( y < -(-1) + 8 = 9 \). Since \( 5 < 9 \), this holds.  
   **Conclusion:** Satisfies both inequalities.

3. **Option C: \((-2, -8)\)**  
   - First inequality: \( y > 9(-2) - 8 = -26 \). Since \( -8 > -26 \), this holds.  
   - Second inequality: \( y < -(-2) + 8 = 10 \). Since \( -8 < 10 \), this holds.  
   **Conclusion:** Satisfies both inequalities.

4. **Option D: \((0, 0)\)**  
   - First inequality: \( y > 9(0) - 8 = -8 \). Since \( 0 > -8 \), this holds.  
   - Second inequality: \( y < -(0) + 8 = 8 \). Since \( 0 < 8 \), this holds.  
   **Conclusion:** Satisfies both inequalities.

5. **Option E: \((1, 5)\)**  
   - First inequality: \( y > 9(1) - 8 = 1 \). Since \( 5 > 1 \), this holds.  
   - Second inequality: \( y < -(1) + 8 = 7 \). Since \( 5 < 7 \), this holds.  
   **Conclusion:** Satisfies both inequalities.

6. **Option F: \((-1, -1)\)**  
   - First inequality: \( y > 9(-1) - 8 = -17 \). Since \( -1 > -17 \), this holds.  
   - Second inequality: \( y < -(-1) + 8 = 9 \). Since \( -1 < 9 \), this holds.  
   **Conclusion:** Satisfies both inequalities.

The only point that does not satisfy both inequalities is **Option A**.
