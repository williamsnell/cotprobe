Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about adding more basis functions in a linear model. Hmm, I remember that basis functions are used to transform the original features into a higher-dimensional space. This is often done to make the model more flexible, right? Like when you're dealing with nonlinear data, you can use polynomial basis functions to capture those patterns.

Wait, but how does adding more basis functions affect the model's bias and variance? I think I remember something about the bias-variance tradeoff. So, when you increase the model's capacity by adding more basis functions, you're making it more complex. A more complex model is better at fitting the training data, which would reduce bias because it captures more of the underlying pattern. But the downside is that it might start fitting the noise in the training data too, which increases variance. So, high variance means the model isn't generalizing well to new data.

So, the question is asking what happens when we add more basis functions. I think the answer relates to lowering bias and raising variance. Let me look at the options again.

Option A says "Decreases model bias" — that makes sense because a more flexible model should have lower bias. But what about variance? If variance increases, then the model might overfit.

Option B is "Increases estimation bias" — wait, doesn't adding basis functions reduce bias? So B might not be right.

Option E is "Decreases variance" — no, I don't think so. More basis functions usually lead to higher variance because the model can overfit.

Wait, another angle: in the context of linear regression, adding more features (through basis expansion) can lead to overfitting. So the model becomes more prone to fitting the noise, which is high variance. But because it's more flexible, it's better at capturing the true relationship, hence lower bias.

So the correct effect is that bias decreases and variance increases. But I need to look at the options again.

Looking at the options: Option A is correct about decreasing bias, but it doesn't mention variance. Option E is about decreasing variance, which is incorrect. So perhaps the correct answer is that adding more basis functions decreases bias but may increase variance. Wait, but none of the options directly state both.

Wait the question is about what happens when adding more basis functions. So the model becomes more flexible, which typically leads to lower bias but higher variance. So the model's bias decreases, but variance increases.

But looking at the options, let's check each one.

Option A: Decreases model bias — yes, that's correct, but what about variance? The option doesn't say anything about that.

Wait, the question asks what's the most probable option when adding more basis functions. So considering the options, A says bias decreases, which is correct. But I think another option might be more accurate.

Wait, another thought: in models like linear regression with more features, the model can become overfit, which is high variance. So more basis functions (which are a type of feature engineering) lead to lower bias but higher variance. So the correct answer would be that bias decreases and variance increases.

Looking again, the options don't combine both effects. So perhaps the question is more about the immediate effect on bias when adding more basis functions.

Because without regularization, adding more features (basis functions) would reduce bias but increase variance. So the option that says "Decreases model bias" is correct, but it doesn't mention variance.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. It says "pick the most probable option." So from the options given, which one aligns with the effect.

Option A says it decreases model bias. That's correct.

Option E says decreases variance, which is wrong.

Option I think the correct answer is A: Decreases model bias.

Wait, but another thought. In a linear model with more basis functions, the model's capacity increases, which means it can fit the training data better, reducing bias. But as variance increases, the model might not generalize well. So among the options, the correct effect is that bias decreases.

So the answer would be A.

Adding more basis functions to a linear model increases its flexibility, allowing it to better capture the underlying patterns in the data. This typically results in a reduction of model bias because the model can more accurately approximate the true relationship. However, this increased flexibility also makes the model more prone to overfitting, which can lead to an increase in variance. Among the given options, the most accurate choice is that adding more basis functions decreases model bias.

Answer: A
