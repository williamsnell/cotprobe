Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the efficiency of an alternator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that efficiency for electrical machines is generally the ratio of output power to input power, right? So efficiency η = (Output Power) / (Input Power) * 100%. But wait, I need to make sure I'm getting the correct output and input.

The problem gives me a 2000 kVA alternator operating at a power factor of 0.85. Let me calculate the output power first. The formula for power is P = V * I * pf. But wait, since it's three-phase, maybe I should use the right formula. Oh wait, kVA is the apparent power, so the actual output power should be kVA * pf. So 2000 kVA is 2,000,000 VA. Multiply by 0.85, that gives 1,700,000 watts or 1,700 kW. So output power is 1,700 kW.

But wait, I think that's the output power. Now I need to find the input power, which would be the sum of the output plus all the losses. Or wait, in the case of alternators, the input is the mechanical power provided, which is equal to the output power plus all losses. So to find the input, I need to calculate all the losses and add them to the output.

The problem lists several losses: friction and windage, iron losses, stray-load losses, and I think there's also the armature resistance loss and maybe field loss. Let's see.

Friction and windage is given as 18.8 kW. Iron losses are 37.6 kW. Stray-load losses are 2.2 kW. So those add up. Let me sum them first: 18.8 + 37.6 = 56.4, then +2.2 gives 58.6 kW.

Wait, but what about the armature resistance loss? Oh right, the armature has a certain resistance, and when current flows through it, there's an I²R loss. But the problem gives the DC armature resistance as 0.08 ohms at 75°C. But they said to take the effective resistance as 1.3 times that value, so 0.08 * 1.3 = 0.104 ohms.

So I need to find the armature current, square it, multiply by resistance to get the loss. But wait, the alternator is three-phase. The resistance per phase... Hmm, for a three-phase machine, the line current is related to the power. The alternator is 2,300 volts, which I think is the line-to-line voltage. So the phase voltage would be 2300 / sqrt(3) ≈ 1328 volts.

The apparent power S is 2000 kVA, so for a three-phase system, S = sqrt(3) * V_L * I_L. So I_L (line current) = S / (sqrt(3) * V_L). Plugging in the numbers: 2000 * 10^3 / (sqrt(3) * 2300). Let me calculate that. 

Wait, 2000 kVA is 2,000,000 VA. So I_L = 2,000,000 / (1.732 * 2300). Let's compute the denominator: 1.732 * 2300 ≈ 3983.6. So I_L ≈ 2e6 / 3983.6 ≈ 502.5 A approximately.

Wait, but the armature resistance loss is calculated using the phase current, right? Or is it the line current? Hmm, maybe I should think about this differently. Since it's a three-phase armature, the resistance per phase is R_phase = R_dc / 2, because in DC the total resistance is phase resistance times 2 (for the two phases in series in a wave winding, perhaps). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, for a three-phase machine, the effective resistance is the same as the DC resistance because the current in each phase flows through the same windings, but considering the AC effect, the effective resistance is adjusted by a factor, which in this problem is given as 1.3 times the DC value. So the effective armature resistance R_a is 0.104 ohms.

Wait, but to compute the I²R loss, I need the root mean square (rms) current in the armature. The line current is 502.5 A, and for a three-phase star-connected machine, the phase current I_p is the same as the line current in a star connection. So the phase current is 502.5 A. 

So the armature resistance loss is I_p² * R_a. So that's (502.5)^2 * 0.104. Let me compute that. 502.5 squared is approx 252,500 (since 500^2 is 250,000, and 2.5^2 is 6.25, cross terms 2*500*2.5=2500, so total 250,000 + 2500 +6.25=252,506.25). So 252506.25 * 0.104 = let's calculate 252506 * 0.1 is 25,250.625, 0.004 is 1,010.025. So total ≈ 26,260.65 watts, or about 26.26 kW.

Wait, but wait. The armature resistance is given as the DC resistance, so when using AC, the effective resistance is 1.3 times higher. Oh, which I already multiplied, so 0.104 ohms is correct. So the loss is 26.26 kW.

Then, there's the field loss. The field takes 72 A at 125 V. So field loss is I * V = 72 * 125 = 9,000 watts, which is 9 kW.

So now, summing all the losses:

Friction and windage: 18.8 kW

Iron losses: 37.6 kW

Stray-load losses: 2.2 kW

Armature resistance loss: 26.26 kW

Field loss: 9 kW

Wait, but wait: Is the field loss considered as part of the losses? Because in an alternator, the field current is supplied by the exciter, which in turn is powered by the machine's output or from another source. Wait, but in the context of the problem, I think the field loss is included in the excitation system and should be added to the losses because it's part of the power consumed.

So adding all these: 18.8 + 37.6 = 56.4; 56.4 + 2.2 = 58.6; 58.6 + 26.26 = 84.86; 84.86 +9 = 93.86 kW of total losses.

Wait, but wait again. Let me think: The field loss is the power taken by the field winding. So yes, it's a loss because it's power consumed without contributing to the output. So yes, include it.

So total losses are 93.86 kW.

Now, the output power is 1,700 kW, as calculated earlier.

So the input power required is output power plus losses: 1,700 + 93.86 = 1,793.86 kW.

So efficiency η = (1,700 / 1,793.86) * 100%.

Let me compute that. 1,700 divided by 1,793.86 is approximately 0.948, so 94.8%. Wait, but the options don't have 94.8. The options are A:98.3, B:90.5, etc. Option E is 94.1, G is 93.6, so perhaps my calculation is off somewhere.

Wait, wait, perhaps I miscalculated the armature current. Let me double-check that part.

The line current I_L = (kVA * 1000) / (sqrt(3) * V_L) 

So 2000 kVA is 2,000,000 VA, V_L is 2300 V.

So I_L = 2e6 / (1.732 * 2300) = 2e6 / (3983.6) ≈ 502.5 A. That seems correct.

Then, the phase current I_p is the same as I_L for a star-connected machine, so that's correct.

Then, armature resistance is 0.104 ohms. So I_p squared is (502.5)^2 = 252506 A², times 0.104 ohms gives 26,260 watts, which is 26.26 kW. That seems right.

Adding all the losses: 18.8 +37.6 is 56.4, plus 2.2 is 58.6, plus 26.26 is 84.86, plus 9 is 93.86 kW.

Wait, but let me check if I included all the losses correctly. The problem states:

- Friction and windage loss: 18.8 kW

- Iron losses: 37.6 kW

- Stray-load losses: 2.2 kW

- Armature resistance loss: 26.26 kW (calculated)

- Field loss: 9 kW.

Yes, that's all included.

So total losses are 93.86 kW. Output is 1,700 kW.

So efficiency is (1,700 / (1,700 +93.86 )) *100 = 1,700/1,793.86 = approx 0.948, so 94.8%.

But the options don't have 94.8. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of armature loss.

Wait, wait another thought: The problem says "the d-c armature-winding resistance at 75°C between terminals is 0.08 ohm". But wait, for a three-phase machine, the armature resistance per phase would be R_dc / 2, because in a three-phase machine, each phase's resistance is half of the terminal DC resistance (assuming a wye connection, perhaps). Because in DC, the current goes through two phases in series, so R_dc = 2 * R_phase. So R_phase = R_dc / 2.

Wait, but earlier I took R_effective as 1.3 * R_dc. But perhaps that's not correct. Let me think.

In a three-phase alternator, the armature winding is connected in a wye (star) configuration, so each phase's resistance is R_phase = R_dc / 2. Because when measuring DC resistance between two terminals, you're effectively measuring two phases in series. So the DC resistance is 0.08 ohms for the entire armature. So per phase, it's 0.04 ohms. Then, the effective AC resistance is 1.3 times that, so 0.04 * 1.3 = 0.052 ohms per phase.

Wait, that changes things. So I think I made a mistake earlier in calculating R_effective. I should have considered the DC resistance per phase, then multiplied by 1.3.

So let me redo the armature loss calculation.

DC resistance between terminals is 0.08 ohms, which for a three-phase machine would be the resistance of two phases in series (since you're measuring between two terminals). So per phase, R_phase_dc = 0.08 / 2 = 0.04 ohms.

Then, the effective AC resistance is 1.3 times this, so 0.04 * 1.3 = 0.052 ohms.

Now, the line current is still 502.5 A, but the phase current I_p is the same as line current for a star-connected machine, so I_p = 502.5 A.

So the armature loss is I_p^2 * R_phase_ac = (502.5)^2 * 0.052.

Let me compute that: 502.5^2 is 252,506.25. Multiply by 0.052: 252506.25 * 0.052.

Hmm, 252506 * 0.05 is 12,625.325, and 0.002 is 505.025. So total is 12,625.325 + 505.025 = 13,130.35 watts, or 13.13 kW.

Wait, that's a big difference from my initial 26.26 kW. So I think I messed up the initial calculation by not considering the per-phase resistance correctly.

So now, the armature loss is 13.13 kW instead of 26.26 kW.

So total losses now are:

Friction and windage: 18.8

Iron: 37.6

Stray: 2.2

Armature: 13.13

Field: 9

Sum them: 18.8 + 37.6 = 56.4; +2.2 → 58.6; +13.13 →71.73; +9 → 80.73 kW.

Wait, 18.8 +37.6 = 56.4; 56.4 +2.2=58.6; 58.6 +13.13=71.73; 71.73 +9=80.73 kW total losses.

So output is 1,700 kW. So input is 1,700 +80.73 = 1,780.73 kW.

Efficiency η = (1,700 / 1,780.73) * 100 ≈ Let's compute that.

1,700 ÷ 1,780.73 ≈ 0.9547 → 95.47%. But none of the options are that high. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Options include E:94.1, G:93.6, so maybe I'm still missing something.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the phase current. Let me think again. For a three-phase alternator with a line voltage of 2300 V, the phase voltage V_p is 2300 / sqrt(3) ≈ 1328 V. The line current is I_L = (kVA * 1000) / (sqrt(3) * V_L) → 2,000,000 / (1.732 * 2300) ≈ 502.5 A. So I_L is 502.5 A.

In a star connection, the phase current I_p is the same as the line current I_L, so that part is correct.

Wait, but when calculating the armature copper loss, for a three-phase machine, it's 3 * I_p² * R_phase. Wait, no, because each phase contributes I_p² R_phase, so for three phases, it's 3 * I_p² R_phase. But earlier I used I_p squared times R_phase once, which would be the loss per phase. So to get total loss, it's 3 * (I_p² * R_phase).

Wait, that's a critical mistake. So armature loss is 3 * I_p² * R_phase, not just I_p squared times R_phase.

So let's recalculate armature loss correctly.

I_p is 502.5 A, R_phase is 0.052 ohms.

So per phase loss is (502.5)^2 * 0.052 → 252,506 * 0.052 ≈ 13,130 W or 13.13 kW. But that's per phase. Since there are three phases, total loss is 3 * 13.13 kW ≈ 39.39 kW.

Oh no! So that's a big mistake. So the armature loss is actually 39.39 kW, not 13.13 kW.

So now, with that correction, let's recalculate the total losses.

Friction and windage: 18.8

Iron: 37.6

Stray: 2.2

Armature: 39.39

Field:9

Adding them up: 18.8 +37.6 =56.4; +2.2=58.6; +39.39=98; +9=107 kW.

Wait, that's a total loss of 107 kW.

So input power is output (1,700 kW) plus losses (107 kW) → 1,807 kW.

Efficiency is 1,700 / 1,807 * 100 ≈ 0.9406 → 94.06% which is approximately 94.1%.

Looking at the options, option E is 94.1, so that should be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check everything once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Output power: 2000 kVA * 0.85 = 1,700 kW. Correct.

2. Line current: 2e6 / (1.732 * 2300) ≈ 502.5 A. Correct.

3. DC resistance is 0.08 ohms. For three-phase, DC measures two phases, so per phase R_dc is 0.04 ohms. Effective R is 1.3 * 0.04 = 0.052 ohms. Correct.

4. Armature loss calculation: 3 * (502.5)^2 * 0.052. Let me compute (502.5)^2 = 252,506.25. Multiply by 0.052 → 252,506.25 * 0.052 = 13,130.125 W. Multiply by 3 → 39,390.375 W → 39.39 kW. Correct.

5. Summing all losses: 18.8 +37.6=56.4; +2.2=58.6; +39.39=98; +9=107 kW. Correct.

6. Input: 1,700 +107 = 1,807 kW.

7. Efficiency: 1,700 / 1,807 ≈ 0.9406 → 94.06%, so 94.1% when rounded. So option E is correct.
</think>

To calculate the efficiency of the alternator, we use the formula:

\[
\eta = \frac{\text{Output Power}}{\text{Input Power}} \times 100\%
\]

### Step 1: Output Power
The alternator operates at a rated apparent power of 2000 kVA and a power factor of 0.85. The output power is:

\[
P_{\text{out}} = \text{kVA} \times \text{pf} = 2000 \times 0.85 = 1700 \, \text{kW}
\]

### Step 2: Losses
The total losses include:
1. **Friction and Windage Loss**: \( 18.8 \, \text{kW} \)
2. **Iron Loss**: \( 37.6 \, \text{kW} \)
3. **Stray-Load Loss**: \( 2.2 \, \text{kW} \)
4. **Armature Resistance
