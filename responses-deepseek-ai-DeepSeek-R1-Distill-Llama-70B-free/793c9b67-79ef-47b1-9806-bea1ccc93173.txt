Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about standard-setting in human rights diplomacy. I remember from my classes that standard-setting is a key concept in international human rights. Let me break it down.

The question is asking what the function of standard-setting is. The options are A through D. I need to think about what standard-setting entails. From what I recall, standard-setting refers to the process where international bodies, like the United Nations, create documents or treaties that outline human rights norms. These are meant to set a common standard that countries should follow.

Wait, but are these standards binding or non-binding? I think treaties are binding because countries ratify them, which means they agree to be legally bound. But sometimes there are declarations or other instruments that aren't treaties, which might be non-binding. So standard-setting could involve both, but the primary function is probably about creating binding standards because that's the main purpose of treaties.

Looking at the options:

Option A says standard-setting means putting forward binding legal standards. That makes sense because treaties are binding. Option B says merely proposing binding standards, which doesn't sound right because it's more than just proposing; they become part of international law once ratified. Option C mentions non-binding, which might be part of it but not the main function. Option D talks about setting standards in human rights treaties, which is accurate because that's where a lot of standard-setting happens.

Wait, the question is about the function, not just where it happens. So the function is to set standards, which can be either binding or non-binding. But the primary function, especially in diplomacy, is to create binding treaties. So A and D are both possible, but I need to see what each option says exactly.

Option A: putting forward binding legal standards. Option D: setting certain standards in human rights treaties. So D is more about the method (using treaties) rather than the nature of the standards. The function is about creating those standards, which are binding.

Alternatively, sometimes standard-setting can include both binding and non-binding, but the question is about the function. Since the main goal is to establish legal standards that countries must adhere to, the answer is probably A. Or is it D because it's about treaties?

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The function is to set standards, which are typically in treaties. So D says it's about setting standards in treaties, which are binding. But A says putting forward binding standards, which could be the same thing. Wait, the exact function is about creating the standards, so putting them forward as binding. So maybe A is correct.

But wait, standard-setting in diplomacy often involves negotiating treaties, which are binding. So the function is to set these binding standards. So I'm leaning towards A. But earlier I thought D might be correct because it's about treaties. I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, the options: Option D says "setting certain standards of conduct in human rights treaties." So it's about the content, the standards within treaties. Option A is about the action of putting forward binding standards, which could be treaties or other instruments. Since the question is about the function, which is to establish these standards, I think the best answer is A. Because standard-setting's function is to create binding legal standards, which are then included in treaties. So the function is putting forward those binding standards, which is option A.

The function of standard-setting in human rights diplomacy is to establish binding legal standards, which are often incorporated into treaties through processes like negotiation and ratification. Among the options provided, the most accurate description of this function is putting forward binding legal standards.

Answer: A
