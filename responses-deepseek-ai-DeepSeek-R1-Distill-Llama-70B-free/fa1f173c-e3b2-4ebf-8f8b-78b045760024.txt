Okay, so I've got this problem here where a load of 7.5 tons needs to be lifted from a depth of 760 feet using a wire rope. The suggested setup uses a 6×19 IPS rope with a diameter of 1 and a half inches, and a drum that's 96 inches in diameter. I need to check if these sizes are suitable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on wire rope standards, but let's try to work through this.

First, I remember that wire ropes have certain standards for their construction, like the 6×19 classification. The "6×19" refers to the number of strands and the number of wires per strand. So 6 strands with 19 wires each. This is a common type, often used in hoisting because it's flexible and resistant to wear.

Next, the diameter of the rope is 1.5 inches. I think the diameter is important because it affects the strength and the number of wraps around the drum. The drum's diameter is 96 inches, which is pretty large. I guess the drum size matters for the rope's bend radius and the number of windings.

I remember that there's a formula to calculate the minimum drum diameter based on the wire rope size. The formula is D = d * (n + 1), where D is the drum diameter, d is the rope diameter, and n is the number of windings. Wait, or is it something else? Maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, I think the minimum drum diameter is determined by ensuring the rope has enough flexibility without causing excessive stress during winding.

Another point is the tons to be lifted. 7.5 tons is a hefty load. So the wire rope must have sufficient breaking strength. The breaking strength depends on the rope's diameter, material, and construction. For a 1.5-inch 6×19 IPS rope, I think the breaking strength is around... hmm, I might need to look up the standard values. Wait, from what I recall, a 1.5-inch 6×19 IPS (Independent Wire Rope Core) has a breaking strength of about 14,400 pounds. But wait, the load here is 7.5 tons. Let me convert that: 7.5 tons is 15,000 pounds. So the rope's breaking strength is 14,400 lbs, which is just under the load. That seems problematic because the rope shouldn't be loaded beyond 20% of its breaking strength, right? Or wait, maybe that's the safety factor. So if the rope can handle 14,400 lbs, then using it for 15,000 would be over. So the rope might not be sufficient. But wait, maybe I got the breaking strength wrong. Maybe it's higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the formula for the required rope diameter. The formula for the safe load (P) is P = (d^2) * S * K, where d is the diameter, S is the ultimate tensile strength per square inch, and K is a factor based on the rope construction. For 6×19 IPS, K is around 0.36. Let's see, assuming S is 180,000 psi for IPS ropes. So d^2 is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So P = 2.25 * 180,000 * 0.36. Let's compute that: 2.25 * 180,000 is 405,000. Multiply by 0.36 gives 145,800 pounds. That's about 73 tons. Wait, that can't be right because that's way higher than 7.5 tons. Oh, wait, maybe I'm mixing up something. Because 1.5 inches is a standard size and 6×19 is common, perhaps the breaking strength is sufficient. Maybe I was wrong earlier.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of rope wraps on the drum. The depth is 760 ft, so the rope length is 760 ft. The number of layers on the drum would be L/(π*D), where L is the length and D is the drum diameter. But wait, the drum's diameter is 96 inches, which is 8 feet. So L is 760 ft. So the number of wraps around the drum would be 760 / (pi * 8) ≈ 760 / 25.13 ≈ 30.25 layers. So about 30 layers. Each layer is a wrap around the drum.

For each wrap around the drum, the rope bends over the drum, which causes stress. The more layers, the more the stress, especially in the outer layers. The maximum allowable stress is considered when determining the minimum drum size. I remember that the minimum drum diameter depends on the rope diameter to prevent excessive bending stress.

There's a formula for the minimum drum diameter: D = d * (n + 1). Wait, where n is the number of wraps. Or maybe it's D = d * (2n), I'm not sure. Alternatively, the drum diameter should be at least 20 times the rope diameter for each wrap. Hmm, that rings a bell. So if the rope is 1.5 inches, 20 * 1.5 = 30 inches minimum per wrap. But wait, that would be for each wrap, perhaps. Or maybe the total drum diameter must be sufficient to allow the required number of wraps without exceeding the stress limits.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the ASME or OSHA standards. From what I remember, the drum diameter must be at least 20 times the rope's diameter multiplied by the number of layers. Or maybe it's 20 times the rope diameter for the first layer and 10 times for each additional. Or perhaps a different ratio. Alternatively, the minimum drum size is determined by the rope's flexibility and the number of wraps to prevent excessive wear and stress.

Alternatively, the formula is D = d(2n + 1), where n is the number of layers. Let's compute n first. The total length L = πDn, but wait, D is the drum diameter, and the length per wrap is the circumference, πD. So number of wraps would be L / (πD). So for L=760 ft, D=96 in = 8 ft. So 760 / (π * 8) ≈ 30.25 wraps. So about 30 layers.

Then, using D = d(2n + 1), with d = 1.5 inches, n=30. So D = 1.5*(2*30 +1) = 1.5 *61 = 91.5 inches. Hmm, the drum is 96 inches, which is larger than 91.5. So that would be acceptable. So the drum size is okay.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct formula. Alternatively, some sources say that the minimum drum diameter should be at least 20 times the rope diameter for the first layer, and 10 times for each additional layer. So for n layers, the minimum D is d*(20 + 10*(n-1)).

So for n=30, D = 1.5*(20 + 10*(29)) = 1.5*(20 + 290) = 1.5 * 310 = 465 inches. That's way larger than 96 inches, which would mean the drum is way too small. But that doesn't make sense because 96 inches is 8 feet, which is a large drum. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is D = d*(n + 1), but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the bending stress. The bending stress in a wire rope can be calculated using the formula S_b = E * d^2 / (8D) * K, where E is the modulus of elasticity for steel, around 30,000,000 psi, d is rope diameter, D is drum diameter, and K is a factor depending on the rope construction (like 6×19).

Let me try that. So S_b = (30e6 psi) * (1.5 in)^2 / (8 * 96 in) * K. What's K for 6×19? I think K is around 0.36 for 6×19 IPS ropes.

So plugging in: (3e7) * (2.25) / (768) * 0.36.

Compute numerator: 3e7 * 2.25 = 67,500,000.

67,500,000 / 768 ≈ 87,890 psi.

Multiply by 0.36: 87,890 * 0.36 ≈ 31,620 psi.

Now, the allowable bending stress for a wire rope is typically around 25,000 to 30,000 psi, depending on the application. So 31,620 is slightly above that. Hmm, that suggests that the bending stress is a bit too high, which might mean the drum is too small.

But wait, maybe the allowable stress is higher for hoisting applications. For example, in some cases, the allowable bending stress can be up to 35,000 psi for non-continuous operation. So if 31,620 is under 35k, it might be acceptable. But if the standard is 25k, then it's over.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect. Maybe I should look up the correct formula. Oh wait, perhaps I should use S_b = (E * d^2) / (D * f), where f is a factor. Alternatively, some sources state that the bending stress (in psi) can be calculated as S_b = (Ed^2)/(8D), multiplied by a factor for the rope construction. 

Wait, another approach: the minimum drum diameter is often given as 20 times the rope diameter for the first layer, and each additional layer reduces the required diameter by a factor. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the drum diameter is acceptable if the rope has enough flexibility. Since 6×19 is a flexible rope, maybe 96 inches is sufficient. Let me think about the number of wraps again. 760 feet on a 96-inch drum.

Wait, 96 inches is 8 feet. The circumference is π * 8 ft ≈ 25.13 ft. So the number of wraps is 760 / 25.13 ≈ 30.25 wraps. So 30 layers of rope on the drum.

I think that for each layer, the drum's effective diameter increases by the rope's diameter. So the first layer is at D = 96", the second at D + d, third D + 2d, etc. So the outer layer would be at D + (n-1)*d.

The bending stress is highest in the outermost layer, so that's where we need to calculate it. The outer diameter would be 96 + (30 * 1.5) = 96 + 45 = 141 inches.

So the bending stress for the outer layer would be S_b = (E * d^2) / (8 * D_outer) * K.

E is 30e6 psi, d=1.5, D_outer=141.

So S_b = (3e7) * (2.25) / (8 * 141) * 0.36.

Compute denominator: 8 * 141 = 1128.

3e7 * 2.25 = 67.5e6.

67.5e6 / 1128 ≈ 59,850 psi.

Multiply by 0.36: 59,850 * 0.36 ≈ 21,546 psi.

Hmm, that's well within the acceptable range, say 25k psi. So the bending stress is acceptable.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated for the first layer, I got around 31,620 psi, which was a bit high. But maybe the allowable stress is higher for the first few layers. Or perhaps the average is considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should be based on the average diameter, but I'm not sure. 

So if the outer layer stress is around 21.5k psi, which is under 25k, that's acceptable. So the drum size is okay.

But wait, what about the rope strength? Earlier, I thought the breaking strength was around 14,400 lbs, but the load is 15,000 lbs, which is 7.5 tons. That would exceed the rope's capacity. Wait, but wait, maybe I was wrong about the breaking strength.

Let me double-check the breaking strength. For a 1.5-inch diameter 6×19 IPS rope, the minimum breaking strength (MBS) is calculated as follows:

MBS (lbs) = (d in inches)^2 * 10,000 * K. Where K is a factor based on the rope class. For 6×19 IPS, K is 0.36.

So MBS = (1.5)^2 * 10,000 * 0.36 = 2.25 * 10,000 * 0.36 = 2.25 * 3,600 = 8,100 lbs? Wait, that can't be right because that's way too low for a 1.5-inch rope.

Wait, perhaps the formula is MBS = (d^2) * 1,000 * S, where S is the tensile strength per square inch. For IPS ropes, the tensile strength is 180,000 psi. So:

MBS = (1.5)^2 * 1,000 * 180,000 = 2.25 * 1,000 * 180,000 = 2.25 * 180,000,000 = 405,000,000 lbs? That doesn't make sense either. I must be mixing up formulas.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to standard tables. From what I remember, a 1.5-inch 6×19 IPS rope has an MBS of around 14,400 lbs. But that seems too low for 7.5 tons (15,000 lbs). So if that's the case, the rope wouldn't be sufficient. But that doesn't make sense because 1.5-inch ropes are used for much heavier loads.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing pounds with tons. Oh wait, 7.5 tons is 15,000 pounds. So if the rope's MBS is 14,400 lbs, then it's just barely under. But the safety factor is usually at least 5:1, meaning the rope should be able to handle 5 times the working load. So the working load shouldn't exceed MBS divided by 5. Let's see: 14,400 / 5 = 2,880 lbs. That's way below 15,000. So that can't be right. I must have the breaking strength wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the MBS for 1.5-inch 6×19 IPS is higher. Let me think again. For a 1-inch rope, 6×19 IPS, the MBS is around 9,000 lbs. So 1.5-inch would be larger. Let's see, the area scales with the square of the diameter. So (1.5/1)^2 = 2.25 times larger. So 9,000 * 2.25 = 20,250 lbs. That's still less than 15,000 lbs, but wait, the working load is 15,000, which would require the MBS to be at least 5 times that, 75,000 lbs. But 20,250 is way below that. So that doesn't make sense. I'm clearly misunderstanding something here.

Wait, perhaps the 6×19 classification isn't IPS. Wait, the question says it's a 6×19 IPS rope. IPS stands for Improved Plow Steel, which has higher strength. So perhaps the MBS is higher. Let me think, maybe for a 1.5-inch 6×19 IPS, the MBS is about 35 tons or something? That would make more sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should use an online MBS calculator. But since I can't access that, I'll try to reason. The formula for MBS is based on the tensile strength of the wires. Each wire's breaking strength is its cross-sectional area multiplied by tensile strength. For IPS, the tensile strength is about 180,000 psi. The number of wires in a 6×19 rope is 6 strands with 19 wires each, so 114 wires. Each wire's diameter is rope diameter divided by, say, 8 or 10, depending on the construction. Wait, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key points are: is the rope strong enough for the load, and is the drum size appropriate for the number of wraps without causing excessive bending stress.

From earlier, the bending stress at the outer layer was calculated to be around 21,500 psi, which is acceptable. So drum size is okay.

Regarding the rope strength, if the MBS is higher than 15,000 lbs, which it should be for a 1.5-inch rope, then the rope is acceptable. But earlier I thought MBS was 14,400, which is less than 15,000. That's a problem. But perhaps my MBS figure was wrong. Maybe 6×19 IPS has a higher MBS.

Wait, I think I'm confusing the units. Maybe the MBS is in tons. So 7.5 tons is 15,000 lbs. If the rope's MBS is, say, 9 tons, then 7.5 is within the limit. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that both the rope and drum are suitable based on the bending stress calculation, so the answer would be I: both are acceptable.

But wait, the options include E, which says the rope is acceptable but the drum should be larger. But our calculation showed drum is sufficient. So perhaps the correct answer is I.

But wait, another thought: the length of the rope is 760 feet. So when wrapped around the drum, each wrap's diameter increases by twice the rope's diameter (since it's the circumference). Wait, the number of layers is 30, so the drum's effective diameter for the outer layer is 96 inches + 30 * 1.5 inches. Wait, no, each layer adds one diameter, because when you wrap the rope around, the radius increases by d/2 each time. So the first layer is D = 96 inches, the next is D + 2*(d/2) = D + d. So for n layers, the outer diameter is D + (n)*d.

Wait, 96 inches + 30 * 1.5 inches = 96 + 45 = 141 inches. So the bending stress calculation was correct.

But perhaps the problem is that the rope is only 1.5 inches, and the load is 7.5 tons. So checking if the rope's MBS is sufficient. 

Wait, another approach: the rope's safe working load should be at least the load to be lifted. So the safe working load is MBS divided by the safety factor. Let's say the safety factor is 5:1. So SWL = MBS /
