Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the cost of running a motor. Let's see what it's asking. The cost of electricity is 5 cents per kilowatt-hour. I need to find out how much it costs to run a motor for 2 hours. The motor draws 5 amperes from a 120-volt line.

Hmm, right. I remember that power is calculated using volts and amperes. Power equals volts multiplied by amperes, right? So P = V * I. Let me check that. Yes, that's correct. So the voltage here is 120 volts, and the current is 5 amperes. So 120 * 5 would give me the power in watts.

Calculating that, 120 * 5 = 600 watts. Oh wait, but wait, power is in watts, but the cost is per kilowatt-hour. So I need to convert watts to kilowatts. Since 1 kilowatt is 1000 watts, 600 watts is 0.6 kilowatts.

Now, the motor runs for 2 hours. So the energy used would be power multiplied by time. So 0.6 kW * 2 hours = 1.2 kilowatt-hours.

But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check that. Because sometimes I might confuse whether it's kilowatts or something else. No, wait, kilowatt-hour is a unit of energy, so yes, multiplying power in kW by time in hours gives the correct energy in kWh.

Okay, so 1.2 kWh. Now, the cost is 5 cents per kWh. So the total cost would be 1.2 * 5 cents. Let's compute that. 1.2 * 5 is 6 cents. So that's 6 cents total.

Wait, but let me think again. Some people might get confused between watts and kilowatts here. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So 5 amps at 120 volts is 600 watts, which is 0.6 kW. Running for two hours, that's 0.6 * 2 = 1.2 kWh. Multiply by 5 cents gives 6 cents. So the answer should be 6 cents.

Looking at the options, option I is 6 cents. So the correct answer should be I.

To determine the cost of running the motor, we start by calculating the power consumption using the formula \( P = V \times I \), where \( V \) is voltage and \( I \) is current. 

Given:
- Voltage (\( V \)) = 120 volts
- Current (\( I \)) = 5 amperes

\[
P = 120 \, \text{V} \times 5 \, \text{A} = 600 \, \text{watts} = 0.6 \, \text{kilowatts (kW)}.
\]

Next, we calculate the energy consumed over 2 hours. Energy in kilowatt-hours (kWh) is given by:

\[
\text{Energy} = \text{Power} \times \text{Time} = 0.6 \, \text{kW} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 1.2 \, \text{kWh}.
\]

The cost of electricity is 5 cents per kWh. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[
\text{Cost} = 1.2 \, \text{kWh} \times 5 \, \text{cents/kWh} = 6 \, \text{cents}.
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**I: 6 cents.**
