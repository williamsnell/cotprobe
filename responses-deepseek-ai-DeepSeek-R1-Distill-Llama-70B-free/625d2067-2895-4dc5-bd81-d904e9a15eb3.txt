Okay, I'm trying to figure out what "act jure gestionis" means. I remember from my studies that in international law, especially when it comes to state responsibility, there's a distinction between acts that a state does in its sovereign capacity (jure imperii) and those it does in a more private or commercial capacity (jure gestionis). 

So, the question is asking what an act jure gestionis is. I think jure gestionis refers to when a state acts like a private individual or entity, engaging in commercial or business activities. For example, when a state buys or sells goods, enters into contracts, or runs state-owned enterprises for profit, those would be acts jure gestionis. 

Looking at the options:

Option A says all actions by the State in a public capacity. That doesn't sound right because public capacity would be more jure imperii, which is the sovereign acts.

Option B talks about government officials in their free time. I don't think that's correct because it's about their personal actions, not the state's actions.

Option C states that jure gestionis are acts by the state in a private capacity. That sounds right because private capacity would mean acting like a private entity, which aligns with what I remember.

Option D mentions international treaties, which are more about state sovereignty, so probably jure imperii.

Option E is about court decisions. Courts are part of the judiciary, so their decisions are public acts, jure imperii.

Option F is legislative decisions, which are definitely public acts.

Option G says all purchases by the state are jure gestionis. Purchases could be either, depending on context. For example, buying military equipment might be jure imperii, but buying office supplies could be jure gestionis. So the option says "all purchases," which seems too broad.

Option H is diplomatic missions, which are sovereign functions, so jure imperii.

Option I is military actions, definitely jure imperii.

Option J says all acts by state corporations are jure gestionis. State corporations might engage in both types of acts. For example, a state railway might be jure gestionis, but if it's involved in something sovereign, it might not be. So "all" seems incorrect.

So the best answer seems to be Option C: Acts jure gestionis are those undertaken by States in a private capacity.

The correct answer is C because acts jure gestionis occur when a state acts in a private capacity, similar to a commercial entity, rather than in its sovereign capacity (jure imperii).
