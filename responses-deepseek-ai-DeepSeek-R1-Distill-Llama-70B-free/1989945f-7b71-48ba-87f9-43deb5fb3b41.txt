Okay, so I've got this question about the one-period binomial model for a stock price. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, let's read the question again carefully. The problem gives me some parameters for the model. The period is one year, no dividends, u is 1.433, d is 0.756, and the continuously compounded annual expected return is 10%. I need to find the true probability of the stock price going up.

Wait, so in the binomial model, the stock price can go up or down. 'u' is the upward factor, and 'd' is the downward factor. The true probability is different from the risk-neutral probability, right? Because the risk-neutral one is based on no-arbitrage, while the true probability is based on expected returns.

So the expected return is given as continuously compounded at 10% annually. I remember that the expected return relates to the true probabilities. The formula I think is something like: the expected stock price after one period equals the current stock price multiplied by e raised to the expected return rate.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the expected value of the stock. So, the expected value of the stock next year is S0 * (p*u + (1-p)*d), where p is the true probability of the up move. And this expected value should equal S0 multiplied by e^(μ), where μ is the expected return. Oh wait, no, wait, μ is the continuously compounded expected return. So yes, the expected stock price is S0 * e^(μ).

Wait, let's get the formula straight. The expected return is given as 10%, which is μ. So under the real-world probabilities, the expected future stock price is S0 * e^(μ*T). Since T is one year, it's S0 * e^(0.10).

But on the other hand, the expected future price is also S0 multiplied by [p*u + (1-p)*d], because with probability p it goes up to u*S0 and with (1-p) it goes down to d*S0.

So setting these equal: S0 * e^(μ*T) = S0 * [p*u + (1-p)*d]

Since S0 is on both sides, we can divide both sides by S0, which cancels out. So:

e^(μ*T) = p*u + (1-p)*d

We can plug in the numbers. μ is 0.10, T is 1. So e^0.10 equals p*1.433 + (1-p)*0.756.

Now, what's e^0.10? Let me calculate that. e^0.1 is approximately 1.10517. Because I remember that ln(2) is about 0.693, and e^0.7 is about 2, so for 0.1, it's around 1.105.

So, 1.10517 = p*(1.433) + (1-p)*(0.756)

Let me expand the right-hand side. So:

1.10517 = p*1.433 + 0.756 - p*0.756

Combine like terms. The p terms: 1.433p - 0.756p = (1.433 - 0.756) p = 0.677 p

So 1.10517 = 0.677 p + 0.756

Now, subtract 0.756 from both sides:

1.10517 - 0.756 = 0.677 p

Calculating 1.10517 minus 0.756. Let's see: 1.10517 - 0.756 is 0.34917.

So, 0.34917 = 0.677 p

Now, solve for p: p = 0.34917 / 0.677

Let me compute that. Hmm, 0.34917 divided by 0.677.

Let me approximate. 0.677 times 0.5 is 0.3385, which is a bit less than 0.34917. The difference is about 0.34917 - 0.3385 = 0.01067.

So 0.01067 divided by 0.677 is about 0.01575. So 0.5 + 0.01575 is approximately 0.51575, so around 0.516 or 51.6%.

Wait, but the options given are A:0.58, B:0.75, C:0.55, D:0.30, E:0.40, F:0.60, G:0.65, H:0.70, I:0.52, J:0.45.

Hmm, 0.516 is approximately 0.52, which is option I.

Wait, but wait. Let me check my calculations again, in case I made a mistake.

Wait, 0.34917 divided by 0.677:

Let me compute 0.34917 / 0.677.

Well, 0.677 * 0.5 = 0.3385. Subtract that from 0.34917: 0.34917 - 0.3385 = 0.01067.

Now, 0.01067 divided by 0.677. Let me compute 0.677 * 0.0158 is approximately 0.01067.

So 0.5 + 0.0158 = 0.5158, which is 0.5158, about 51.6%, which would round to 0.52, so option I.

But let me check if I set up the equation correctly. Because sometimes when dealing with continuously compounded returns, I might confuse the formula.

Wait, the expected return is given as the continuously compounded annual expected return, which is 10% or 0.10. So the expected value is S0 * e^(0.10).

But in the binomial model, the expected value is also S0 * [p*u + (1-p)*d]. So equating these:

e^0.10 = p*u + (1-p)*d.

Which is what I did.

Wait, another approach: perhaps someone might confuse the expected return with log returns, but in this case, it's the expected simple return as a continuously compounded rate. So I think my approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps using logarithms, but I don't think that's necessary here.

Wait, let me recompute e^0.10 to be precise. Using a calculator, e^0.1 is approximately 1.105170918. So yes, that's correct.

Then plugging into 1.10517 = 1.433 p + 0.756 (1-p).

Which simplifies to 1.10517 = 0.677 p + 0.756.

Subtract 0.756: 1.10517 - 0.756 = 0.34917.

So 0.34917 = 0.677 p => p = 0.34917 / 0.677 ≈ 0.5158, so 0.5158, which is approximately 0.516, so 0.52 is the closest option, which is option I.

But wait, looking at the options again, option I is 0.52, which is 52%, so that's correct.

Wait, but let me think again: did I mix up u and d? Because sometimes u is (1+return), so if u is 1.433, that's a 43.3% increase. And d is 0.756, which is a 24.4% decrease. So the factors are correct.

Yes, so the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be I:0.52.

To determine the true probability of the stock price going up in a one-period binomial model, we start by equating the expected future stock price under the real-world probabilities to the expected future stock price based on the continuously compounded annual expected return. The key equation is:

\[
e^{\mu T} = p \cdot u + (1-p) \cdot d
\]

where:
- \( \mu = 0.10 \) (continuously compounded annual expected return),
- \( T = 1 \) (one-year period),
- \( u = 1.433 \) (upward factor),
- \( d = 0.756 \) (downward factor),
- \( p \) is the true probability of the stock price going up.

### Step 1: Compute \( e^{\mu T} \)
\[
e^{0.10} \approx 1.10517
\]

### Step 2: Substitute into the equation
\[
1.10517 = p \cdot 1.433 + (1-p) \cdot 0.756
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation
Expand and combine terms:
\[
1.10517 = 1.433p + 0.756 - 0.756p
\]
\[
1.10517 = 0.677p + 0.756
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( p \)
Subtract \( 0.756 \) from both sides:
\[
1.10517 - 0.756 = 0.677p
\]
\[
0.34917 = 0.677p
\]

Divide both sides by \( 0.677 \):
\[
p = \frac{0.34917}{0.677} \approx 0.5158
\]

### Step 5: Match the closest option
The calculated probability \( p \approx 0.5158 \) rounds to \( 0.52 \), which corresponds to option **I**.
