Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the amount due when a payment is made under certain discount terms. Let me try to understand what each part means.

Alright, the problem says that Danny's Furniture bought some furniture from Swift Wholesalers for $1,426. The discount terms are (3/15), (n/30). And the payment was made on June 22. The question is asking what the amount due is under these conditions.

First, I need to parse the discount terms. I remember that these terms are usually written as (discount percentage/number of days), and then the second part is the total number of days before the payment is due without any discount.

So the terms here are (3/15), (n/30). Wait, what does that mean exactly? Hmm, I think the first part, 3/15, means that if the buyer pays within 15 days, they get a 3% discount. The second part, n/30, probably means that if they don't take the discount, the total payment is due in 30 days. I'm a bit fuzzy on what 'n' stands for here. Oh right, 'n' means 'net', so n/30 means the net amount is due in 30 days. So the buyer has two options: either take a 3% discount by paying within 15 days, or pay the full amount within 30 days.

Wait, but in this problem, the payment is made on June 22. The invoice was on June 8. Let me calculate how many days that is. So from June 8 to June 22: 8th to 15th is 7 days (including the 15th?), wait no, wait. Let's be precise.

June 8 is the invoice date. So the next day, June 9, is day 1. So from June 8 to June 22 is 14 days later. Because 8 to 22 is 14 days. So June 8 is day 0, June 9 is day 1, and so on until June 22 is day 14.

So the payment is made on the 14th day after the invoice date. Now, the first discount option is 3% if paid within 15 days. Since 14 days is within the 15-day window, Danny's can take the 3% discount.

Wait, wait a second. The terms are (3/15), (n/30). So the payment made by the 15th day would get the discount. Since June 8 plus 15 days would be June 23, right? Because June has 30 days. Let me check: June 8 + 15 days is June 23? Wait, no. Let's count.

June 8 is day 0. So day 1 is June 9, day 2:10, 3:11, 4:12, 5:13, 6:14, 7:15, 8:16, 9:17, 10:18, 11:19, 12:20, 13:21, 14:22, 15:23. Oh wait, so June 22 is day 14. So the 15th day is June 23. So if payment is made by June 23, they get the 3% discount. But in this case, the payment is on June 22, which is day 14. So that's within the 15-day period. Therefore, they can take the 3% discount.

So the amount due would be the invoice amount minus 3% of the invoice amount.

So the calculation is: $1,426 * (1 - 0.03) = $1,426 * 0.97.

Let me compute that. 1,426 times 0.97. Let me break it down.

First, 1,426 * 1 = 1,426.

Then, 3% of 1,426 is 0.03 * 1,426. Let's compute that:

1,426 * 0.03 = 42.78.

So subtracting that from 1,426 gives 1,426 - 42.78 = 1,383.22.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation to be sure. 1,426 multiplied by 0.97.

Alternatively, 1,426 * 97% can be calculated as:

1,426 * 0.97 = (1,426 * 1) - (1,426 * 0.03) = 1,426 - 42.78 = 1,383.22.

So the amount due would be $1,383.22.

Looking at the options, option G is $1,383.22.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, is there any other discount or term I'm missing here? Let me read the problem again. The terms are (3/15), (n/30). So it's a 3% discount if paid within 15 days, otherwise the net amount is due in 30 days. Since the payment is on day 14, which is within 15 days, the discount applies.

So the correct amount due is $1,383.22, which is option G. Therefore, the answer should be G.

The problem involves calculating the amount due for a purchase under specific discount terms. Danny's Furniture bought furniture for $1,426 with terms (3/15), (n/30), meaning a 3% discount is available if payment is made within 15 days, or the full amount is due within 30 days. The payment was made on June 22, which is 14 days after the invoice date of June 8. Since 14 days is within the 15-day discount period, the 3% discount applies.

To calculate the amount due:

1. Compute 3% of $1,426:  
   \[
   0.03 \times 1,426 = 42.78
   \]

2. Subtract the discount from the invoice amount:  
   \[
   1,426 - 42.78 = 1,383.22
   \]

Thus, the amount due is $1,383.22, which corresponds to option G.
