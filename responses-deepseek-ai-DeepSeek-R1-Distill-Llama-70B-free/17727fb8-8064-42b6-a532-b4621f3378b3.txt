Okay, so I have this question about elasticity of demand. Hmm, I remember that elasticity measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. The formula for price elasticity of demand (PED) is percentage change in quantity demanded divided by percentage change in price. And since demand usually goes down when price goes up, PED is negative, but we often ignore the sign when interpreting.

The question gives me two points. At Price = $q, quantity demanded QD is 11. Oh wait, that might be a typo. Because in the next part, it says at Price = $11, QD is 9. So I think the first point is probably at Price = $9, QD is 11. So the two points are (9,11) and (11,9). I'll make a note of that.

The question has three parts: a), b), and c). Each asks to calculate elasticity using different base points.

Starting with part a), using P=9, QD=11 as the base. So I need to compare this point with the other point. The price increases from 9 to 11, and QD decreases from 11 to 9.

So the change in price is 11-9=2. The average price would be (9+11)/2 =10. So the percentage change in price is (2/10)*100=20%.

Change in quantity is 9-11=-2. Average quantity is (11+9)/2=10. So percentage change in quantity is (-2/10)*100= -20%. 

 PED is (percentage change QD) / (percentage change P). So that's (-20)/20 = -1. But since elasticity is absolute value, it's 1. So unitary elastic. So for part a), the answer is unitarily elastic.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula can be calculated using the arc elasticity method, which uses the average values. Or sometimes, people just use the base point for percentage changes. Oh, right, part a) says to use P=9 as the base. So maybe I should calculate the percentage changes using the base point, not the averages.

So for part a), using the base point (P=9, Q=11). The change in P is 11-9=2. So percentage change in P is (2/9)*100 ≈22.22%. 

Change in Q is 9-11= -2, so percentage change is (-2/11)*100≈-18.18%. 

Then PED is (-18.18)/(22.22) ≈-0.818. Absolute value is about 0.818. So that's inelastic because it's less than 1. Wait, but earlier when I used average, I got 1. So now I'm confused.

Wait, maybe I should clarify: when the question says "using P=9, QD=11 as a base", does that mean using those as the base for calculating the percentage changes, or using average values? Because part c) says using average values as the base. So a) and b) are using one point as the base, while c) uses the midpoints.

So for part a), using (9,11) as the base:

Change in price is 11-9= $2. Percentage change in price is 2/9 ≈22.22%.

Change in quantity is 9-11= -2. Percentage change is (-2)/11≈-18.18%.

So PED is (-18.18)/22.22 ≈-0.818. So inelastic. Because the absolute value is less than 1. So a) is inelastic.

Wait, but wait another thought. Oh wait, when calculating elasticity between two points, it's better to use the average because the choice of base can affect the calculation. But the question is specific: a) uses P=9 as the base, not average. So I think for a), we use the initial point as the base.

Wait, let me make sure. The formula for elasticity when moving from point A to point B is (Q2-Q1)/(Q1) divided by (P2-P1)/(P1). So that's exactly what I did for part a). So the result is approximately 0.818, which is inelastic.

So part a) is inelastic.

Now part b) uses P=11, QD=9 as the base. So the change in price is 11-9=2, but the base is P=11. So percentage change in price is 2/11≈18.18%.

Change in quantity is 9-11=-2. So percentage change is (-2)/9≈-22.22%.

So PED is (-22.22)/18.18 ≈-1.22. Absolute value is 1.22, which is greater than 1, so elastic.

So part b) is elastic.

Part c) uses average values as the base. So average price is (9+11)/2=10. Average quantity is (11+9)/2=10.

Percentage change in price is (2)/10=20%. Percentage change in quantity is (-2)/10=-20%. So PED is (-20)/20=-1. Absolute value is 1, so unitary elastic.

Wait, but wait. So putting it all together:

a) Inelastic (PED ≈0.818)
b) Elastic (PED≈1.22)
c) Unitary elastic (PED=1)

So looking at the options:

The options are a), b), c) in each choice. I need to find the option where a) is inelastic, b) is elastic, c) is unitary.

Looking at the options:

Option H: a) inelastic, b) elastic, c) unitary.

Yes, that matches.

So I think the correct answer is option H.

To determine the elasticity of demand, we use the formula for price elasticity of demand (PED):  

\[
\text{PED} = \frac{\text{Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\text{Percentage Change in Price}}
\]

### Given Data:
- At \( P = 9 \), \( Q_D = 11 \)
- At \( P = 11 \), \( Q_D = 9 \)

### Part (a): Using \( P = 9 \), \( Q_D = 11 \) as the base
1. **Change in Price**: \( 11 - 9 = 2 \)
2. **Percentage Change in Price**: \( \frac{2}{9} \times 100 \approx 22.22\% \)
3. **Change in Quantity**: \( 9 - 11 = -2 \)
4. **Percentage Change in Quantity**: \( \frac{-2}{11} \times 100 \approx -18.18\% \)
5. **PED**: \( \frac{-18.18}{22.22} \approx -0.818 \)  
   Since the absolute value of PED is less than 1, demand is **inelastic**.

### Part (b): Using \( P = 11 \), \( Q_D = 9 \) as the base
1. **Change in Price**: \( 11 - 9 = 2 \)
2. **Percentage Change in Price**: \( \frac{2}{11} \times 100 \approx 18.18\% \)
3. **Change in Quantity**: \( 9 - 11 = -2 \)
4. **Percentage Change in Quantity**: \( \frac{-2}{9} \times 100 \approx -22.22\% \)
5. **PED**: \( \frac{-22.22}{18.18} \approx -1.22 \)  
   Since the absolute value of PED is greater than 1, demand is **elastic**.

### Part (c): Using average values as the base
1. **Average Price**: \( \frac{9 + 11}{2} = 10 \)
2. **Average Quantity**: \( \frac{11 + 9}{2} = 10 \)
3. **Percentage Change in Price**: \( \frac{2}{10} \times 100 = 20\% \)
4. **Percentage Change in Quantity**: \( \frac{-2}{10} \times 100 = -20\% \)
5. **PED**: \( \frac{-20}{20} = -1 \)  
   Since the absolute value of PED is exactly 1, demand is **unitarily elastic**.

### Conclusion:
- **Part (a)**: Demand is **inelastic**.
- **Part (b)**: Demand is **elastic**.
- **Part (c)**: Demand is **unitarily elastic**.

The correct option is **H**.
