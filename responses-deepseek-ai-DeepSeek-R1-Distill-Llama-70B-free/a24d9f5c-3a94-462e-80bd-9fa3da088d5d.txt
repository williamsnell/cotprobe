Okay, so I've got this problem to solve: I need to find the interval where the smallest positive root of the equation tan x + tanh x = 0 lies. Then, using the bisection method, determine the root correct to two decimal places, and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the equation. The equation is tan(x) + tanh(x) = 0. I know that tan(x) is the tangent function, which is periodic and has vertical asymptotes where cos(x) is zero. On the other hand, tanh(x) is the hyperbolic tangent function, which approaches 1 as x approaches infinity and -1 as x approaches negative infinity. It's an odd function, so tanh(-x) = -tanh(x).

So the equation can be rewritten as tan(x) = -tanh(x). Let me think about the properties of these functions. Tan(x) is periodic with a period of π, so it oscillates between positive and negative infinity. Tan(x) is positive in the first and third quadrants, and negative in the second and fourth.

Tanh(x) is positive when x is positive and negative when x is negative. Also, for positive x, tanh(x) is between 0 and 1. So, for x positive, tan(x) must be negative to satisfy the equation tan(x) = -tanh(x), since tanh(x) is positive, making the right-hand side negative.

Wait, but in which quadrants is tan(x) negative? Quadrant II (between π/2 and π) and Quadrant IV (between 3π/2 and 2π). But since we're looking for the smallest positive root, it's likely to be in the first few quadrants after x=0.

Let me consider the behavior of both functions near 0 and as x increases.

At x=0: tan(0) is 0, and tanh(0) is 0. So the equation is 0 + 0 = 0, which satisfies. But wait, is x=0 a root? Yes, but it's not positive. We're looking for the smallest positive root, so maybe the next one.

Wait, but let me double-check. At x approaching 0 from the positive side, tan(x) is approximately x, and tanh(x) is approximately x. So tan(x) + tanh(x) ≈ x + x = 2x, which is positive. So near 0, the function is positive.

Now, looking for when the function becomes negative. Since tan(x) is periodic, let me think where it becomes negative. Between π/2 and π, tan(x) is negative. So perhaps the first positive root after 0 is somewhere around π/2, but let me check.

Wait, but let's compute the function f(x) = tan(x) + tanh(x). We can evaluate f(x) at some points to find where it crosses zero.

Let me start by evaluating f(x) at x=0: f(0)=0+0=0. Hmm, but that's the root at zero. Let's look for the next point.

Let me pick x=1 (radian, approximately 57 degrees). tan(1) is about 1.5574, and tanh(1) is about 0.7616. So f(1)=1.5574 + 0.7616 ≈ 2.319, which is positive.

What about x=2 radians? Let me compute. tan(2) is about -2.185, and tanh(2) is about 0.9640. So f(2)= -2.185 + 0.964 ≈ -1.221, which is negative. So between x=1 and x=2, f(x) goes from positive to negative, so by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a root between 1 and 2.

Wait, but wait: Wait, between 1 and 2, but is that the first positive root after zero? Because at x=0, it's zero, but maybe the next root is after that. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the function is f(x)=tan x + tanh x. Let me plot or imagine the graph.

At x=0: f(x)=0.

As x approaches π/2 from below, tan(x) approaches +infinity. So f(x) approaches +infinity. But wait, when x is just a bit less than π/2, say x=1.5 radians (about 85 degrees): tan(1.5)= about 14.1014, and tanh(1.5)= about 0.9051. So f(x)=14.1014 + 0.9051 = 15.0065, which is positive.

Wait, but when x approaches π/2 from below, f(x) approaches +infinity, but then at x=2 radians (about 114 degrees), which is in the second quadrant, tan(x) is negative, as I calculated earlier (-2.185). But tanh(2) is positive (0.964). So f(2)= -2.185 + 0.964 ≈ -1.221, which is negative.

So the function f(x) goes from positive at x=1.5 to negative at x=2. So somewhere between 1.5 and 2, f(x) crosses zero. Wait, but earlier I thought that at x=1, f(x) is positive, and at x=2, negative, so the root is between 1 and 2. But more precisely, it's between 1.5 and 2?

Wait, maybe I should check x=1.5 and x=2. Let me compute f(1.5):

x=1.5: tan(1.5) is about 14.1014, tanh(1.5)=0.9051. So f(1.5)=14.1014 + 0.9051 ≈ 15.0065, which is positive.

x=1.6: Let's compute:

tan(1.6) is about tan(1.6) is... Let me compute 1.6 radians. Let me think, 1 rad is about 57 degrees, so 1.6 is about 91.67 degrees. Wait, but 1.5708 is π/2, so 1.6 is just a bit beyond π/2. Wait, wait, no: 1.6 is less than π/2 (1.5708 is about 1.5708, so 1.6 is just above π/2. So tan(1.6) is negative because it's in the second quadrant. Wait, wait, no: wait, 1.5708 is π/2 (~1.5708). So 1.6 is just a bit more than π/2, so it's in the second quadrant where tan is negative. So tan(1.6) would be negative. Let me compute it numerically.

Using a calculator, tan(1.6) is approximately tan(1.6) ≈ -34.232. Wait, but that's a very large negative number. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm confusing degrees with radians. Wait, no, I'm definitely in radians here. So at x=1.6, which is just a bit beyond π/2, tan(x) is a large negative number. So tan(1.6)= -34.232. And tanh(1.6)= approx 0.9217. So f(1.6)= -34.232 + 0.9217 ≈ -33.31, which is negative.

Wait a minute, that can't be right. Because at x=1.5, which is less than π/2 (1.5708), tan(1.5) is positive and very large, as I computed before. So between x=1.5 and x=1.6, the function f(x) goes from positive to negative, meaning there's a root in that interval.

Wait, but wait again: At x=1.5, f(x)=15.0065, as computed. At x=1.5708 (π/2), tan(x) approaches +infinity, so f(x) approaches +infinity. Then, at x=1.6, which is just beyond π/2, the tan(x) becomes very negative, so f(x) becomes negative.

Wait, that suggests that the function f(x) crosses zero somewhere between x=1.5 and x=1.6. Hmm, but earlier I thought it was between 1 and 2. So I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.

Wait, wait, let me think again. When x approaches π/2 from below, tan(x) approaches +infinity, so f(x) approaches +infinity. Just beyond π/2, x is greater than π/2 but less than π, so in the second quadrant, where tan(x) is negative. So at x=1.6, which is just beyond π/2, tan(x) is a large negative number, so f(x) is negative.

So between x=1.5 (where f(x) is positive) and x=1.6 (where f(x) is negative), there's a root. So the function crosses zero in (1.5, 1.6). Wait, but that's a smaller interval than I thought earlier.

Wait, but wait again. Let me compute f(1.5)=15.0065, f(1.6)= -34.232 + 0.9217 ≈ -33.31.

Wait, but wait, when x is just a little more than π/2, like 1.5708 + ε, where ε is a tiny positive number, tan(x) is a large negative number, but how about the behavior just before π/2? At x=1.5707 (just below π/2), tan(x) is a very large positive number, making f(x) very positive.

So the function goes from +infinity at x approaching π/2 from below to a large negative number just above π/2. So that must mean that the function crosses zero exactly once in that vicinity. Wait, but that can't be right because at x=0, f(x) is zero, and between 0 and π/2, the function is positive. So the next root after x=0 would be somewhere beyond π/2, but in the second quadrant, so between π/2 and π.

Wait, wait, let me think again. So at x=0, f(x)=0. Then, as x increases from 0 to π/2, f(x) increases from 0 to +infinity because tan(x) increases. So between 0 and π/2, f(x) is positive except at x=0, which is the root.

Then, just beyond π/2, the function drops to a large negative value as x approaches π/2 from above. So the function f(x) goes from +infinity to negative values as x crosses π/2. So by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a root between π/2 and, say, x=2. So the first positive root after x=0 is between π/2 and where?

Wait, π is approximately 3.1416. So between π/2 (1.5708) and π (3.1416), the function goes from negative to positive again, because at x=π, tan(π)=0, and tanh(π) is about 0.99627. So f(π)=0 + 0.99627 = positive.

Wait, no, wait: Wait, wait, at x=π, tan(π) is zero, so f(π) = 0 + tanh(π) ≈ 0 + 0.99627 ≈ 0.99627, which is positive. So between x=1.5708 (π/2) and x=3.1416 (π), the function goes from negative to positive. So there must be another root in (π/2, π). But wait, but between π/2 and x=2, perhaps.

Wait, but earlier I thought that at x=2, f(x)= tan(2) + tanh(2). Let me compute tan(2) accurately. Let me use a calculator.

Wait, 2 radians is about 114.59 degrees. So in the second quadrant, where tan is negative. So tan(2) is approximately -2.185. And tanh(2) is about 0.9640. So f(2)= -2.185 + 0.964 ≈ -1.221, which is negative. So at x=2, f(x) is negative, and at x=3, which is near π (3.1416), f(3)= tan(3) + tanh(3). Let me compute that.

Wait, 3 radians is about 171.89 degrees, so just below π (180 degrees), so in the second quadrant. So tan(3) is positive? Wait, no: Wait, in the second quadrant (between π/2 and π), tan(x) is negative because sine is positive and cosine is negative. So tan(3) should be negative.

Wait, let me compute tan(3) more accurately. 3 radians is 171.89 degrees. So in the second quadrant. So tan(3) should be negative. Let me check with a calculator: tan(3) ≈ -0.1425. Wait, that can't be right because I thought it's more negative. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator function. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more carefully. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that tan(π - x) = -tan(x). So tan(3) can be written as tan(π - 0.1416) because π is approximately 3.1416, so 3.1416 - 0.1416 = 3. So tan(3) = tan(π - 0.1416) = -tan(0.1416). Now, tan(0.1416) is approximately 0.1423, so tan(3) ≈ -0.1423.

Wait, that seems too small. Because in reality, as x approaches π from below, tan(x) approaches zero from the negative side. Wait, but no, wait: Wait, when x approaches π/2 from below, tan(x) approaches +infinity. Then, as x approaches π from below, cos(x) approaches -1, so tan(x) approaches zero from the negative side because sin(π) is zero, so tan(x) approaches zero. Wait, that can't be right because at x=3.1416 (π), tan(x) is zero. So between π/2 and π, tan(x) goes from +infinity to zero, passing through negative values. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct myself.

Wait, when x is in the first quadrant (0 < x < π/2), tan(x) is positive. At x=π/2, it's undefined (asymptote). Then, in the second quadrant (π/2 < x < π), tan(x) is negative, and as x approaches π from below, tan(x) approaches zero from the negative side because sin(π) is 0 and cos(π) is -1, so tan(π) is 0/-1 = 0, but approaching from the left, it's approaching zero from the negative side.

Wait, no, wait: Wait, when x approaches π from below, cos(x) approaches -1, and sin(x) approaches 0 from the positive side (since in the second quadrant, sin is positive). So tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x) approaches 0 from the negative side because cos(x) is negative. So yes, tan(x) approaches 0 from below as x approaches π from below.

So, at x=3, which is near π, tan(x) is a small negative number, approximately -0.1425. And tanh(3) is about 0.99507. So f(3) = -0.1425 + 0.99507 ≈ 0.8526, which is positive.

So, between x=2 and x=3, f(x) goes from -1.221 (at x=2) to +0.8526 (at x=3). So by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there's a root between 2 and 3.

Wait, but earlier I thought that between 1.5 and 1.6, the function goes from positive to negative, implying a root in (1.5,1.6). But that can't be right because at x=1.5708 (π/2), the function is approaching +infinity, and just above that, it's a large negative. So perhaps the first positive root after x=0 is between 1.5708 and 1.6, but then between 2 and 3, there's another root. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, but wait, let's think again. At x=0, f(x)=0. Then, as x increases from 0 to π/2, f(x) increases to +infinity. Then, as x crosses π/2 into the second quadrant, tan(x) becomes negative, so f(x) drops from +infinity to some negative value. So the function must cross zero once between π/2 and some point beyond. But wait, when x is just a little more than π/2, like 1.6, f(x) is negative. But at x=π, f(x)=0.99627, which is positive. So between π/2 and π, the function goes from negative to positive, implying a root in that interval.

Wait, but wait: Wait, at x=1.5708 (π/2), f(x) is approaching +infinity. Just a tiny bit beyond π/2, say x=1.5709, tan(x) is a very large negative number, making f(x) very negative. So the function goes from +infinity to a large negative at x=1.5709, and then as x approaches π, it increases to f(π)=0.99627, which is positive. So between x=1.5708 and x=3.1416, the function must cross zero exactly once, moving from negative to positive. So the root is somewhere between 1.5708 and 3.1416.

But wait, earlier I thought that at x=1.5, f(x) is positive, and at x=1.6, it's negative, implying a root between 1.5 and 1.6. But that can't be, because at x=1.5, which is less than π/2, f(x) is positive, and at x=1.6, which is just beyond π/2, it's negative. So the function goes from positive to negative across x=π/2, implying a root
