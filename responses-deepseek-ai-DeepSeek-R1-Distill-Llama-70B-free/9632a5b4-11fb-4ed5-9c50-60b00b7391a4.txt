Okay, so I've got this problem about a supersonic wind tunnel. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. So the setup is a reservoir with high-pressure gas that's discharged through a convergent-divergent nozzle into a test section. The throat area is given as 500 mm², and the Mach number in the test section is 4. They want the cross-sectional area of the test section, and gamma is 1.4.

Wait, right, I remember that for supersonic flows, especially in nozzles, the area ratio is important. Oh right, the Mach number relates to the area change. I think there's a formula that connects the Mach number at the throat and the test section. Oh wait, the area at the throat is the minimum area, so that's where M=1, right? Because the throat is where the flow becomes sonic.

So, in a convergent-divergent nozzle, the flow starts subsonic, goes through the throat where it's M=1, and then becomes supersonic in the divergent section. So the test section is part of the divergent section where the Mach number is 4.

I think the key here is the relation between the Mach number and the area ratio. The formula I remember is something like (A/A*) = (γ+1)/(2*(1 + cos(theta)))... No, wait, that's not right. Oh wait, perhaps it's the area ratio as a function of Mach number. I think it's derived from the isentropic flow equations.

Right, the formula is (A/A*) = [ (γ + 1) / (2) ) * (1 + ( (γ-1)/ (γ+1) ) * M² ) ]^( (γ+1)/(2(γ-1)) ) )

Wait, no, maybe it's simpler. Oh, wait, for a nozzle, the area at any point compared to the throat area (A*) is given by A/A* = (1/M) * [ ( (γ+1) )/( 2 (1 + ( (γ-1)/2 ) M² ) ) ) ]^( (γ+1)/(2(γ-1)) ) )

Wait, that sounds complicated. Alternatively, I think the area ratio can be found using A/A* = ( (γ + 1) / 2 )^{ (γ+1)/(γ-1) ) } * (1 + ( (γ -1)/2 ) M^2 )^{ (γ+1)/(γ-1) ) } ) / M

Wait, maybe it's better to look up the area ratio formula for a given Mach number. Oh wait, I can't look it up, but I think I remember that for a given Mach number M, the area ratio A/A* is equal to ( (gamma + 1)/(2) * (1 + ((gamma -1)/2)*M^2) ) )^ ( (gamma +1)/(gamma -1) ) ) / M.

Wait, maybe I should break it down. Let me think about the isentropic flow relations. The area ratio depends on the Mach number. The formula is:

A/A* = [ (γ + 1) / (2 * (1 + ( (γ-1)/2 ) * M² ) ) ) ]^{ (γ+1)/(γ-1) ) } * (1/M)

Wait, no. Another approach: The relation between the area and Mach number is given by the equation:

(A / A*) = [ ( ( γ + 1 ) / 2 ) * ( 1 + ( ( γ - 1 ) / 2 ) M² ) ) ]^{ (γ+1)/(γ -1)} } / M

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the area ratio as a function of Mach number. I think the formula is:

A = A* * ( ( (γ + 1)/2 )^((γ+1)/(γ-1)) ) * (1 + ( (γ -1)/2 ) M^2 )^{ (γ+1)/(γ-1) } ) / ( M * ( (1 + ( (γ - 1)/2 ) M^2 ) )^{1/2} } )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should go back to the basics. For isentropic flow, the area ratio can be found using the relation:

(A / A*) = ( 1 / M ) * [ ( ( 2 (γ + 1) ) / ( γ - 1 ) ) * ( 1 + ( ( γ - 1 ) / 2 ) M² ) ) ]^{ (γ+1)/(γ-1)} }

Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I remember that the area ratio (A/A*) is given by:

A/A* = ( (γ + 1)/(2) )^{(γ+1)/(γ-1)} } * (1 + ( (γ -1)/2 ) M² )^{(γ+1)/(γ-1)} ) / M

So plugging in gamma=1.4, M=4.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute (gamma + 1)/(gamma - 1). Gamma is 1.4.

Gamma + 1 = 2.4, gamma-1 = 0.4. So (2.4)/(0.4) = 6.

So exponent terms will have 6 in the denominator and numerator.

Wait, but wait, the formula I might have mixed up exponents.

Alternatively, the area ratio can be written as:

A/A* = [ ( (γ + 1) / 2 ) * ( 1 + ( (γ - 1)/2 ) M² ) ]^{ (γ +1)/(γ -1) } / M

So let's compute each part. Let me plug in gamma=1.4, M=4.

Compute (gamma +1)/2 = (2.4)/2 = 1.2.

Compute (gamma -1)/2 = 0.4/2 = 0.2.

So the term (1 + 0.2 * M² ). M is 4, so M² is 16. 0.2*16=3.2. So 1 + 3.2 =4.2.

So the numerator in the square bracket is 1.2 * 4.2.

1.2 *4.2 is (1*4.2) + (0.2*4.2) = 4.2 + 0.84 = 5.04.

So the bracket term is 5.04.

Now, the exponent is (gamma +1)/(gamma -1) = (2.4)/(0.4) =6.

So (5.04)^6.

Divide that by M, which is 4.

Wait, no, the entire bracket term is raised to the 6th power, then divided by M.

So:

A/A* = (5.04^6) / 4.

Wait, let's compute 5.04^6. Hmm, that might be computationally intensive.

Wait, 5^6 is 15625. 5.04 is a little larger.

But perhaps I can compute it step by step.

5.04^2 = (5 + 0.04)^2 = 25 + 2*5*0.04 + 0.04^2 = 25 + 0.4 + 0.0016 = 25.4016.

Then 5.04^3 = 5.04 * 25.4016 ≈ let's compute 5*25.4016=127.008, 0.04 *25.4016≈1.016064. So total is ~128.024.

5.04^4 = (5.04^2)^2 = (25.4016)^2. Let's compute that.

25^2=625. 25.4016 is 25 + 0.4016.

So (25 + d)^2 = 25^2 + 2*25*d + d^2.

d=0.4016.

So 625 + 2*25*0.4016 = 625 + 50 *0.4016 = 50 *0.4 is 20, 50 *0.0016=0.08. So 625 +20.08 =645.08.

Then d²: (0.4016)^2 ≈0.16128.

So total (25.4016)^2≈ 645.08 +0.16128≈645.24128.

Wait, but 25.4016 is 5.04 squared, so when squared again (to get 5.04^4), it's 25.4016^2 ≈ 645.237.

Then, 5.04^5 = 5.04 * 645.237 ≈ let's compute 5 *645.237=3226.185, 0.04 *645.237≈25.80948. So total ≈3226.185 +25.80948≈3251.994.

5.04^6 =5.04 *3251.994 ≈ let's compute 5 *3251.994=16259.97, 0.04 *3251.994≈130.07976. So total ≈16259.97 +130.07976≈16390.05.

So 5.04^6 ≈16390.05.

Then, A/A* =16390.05 /4 ≈4097.51.

So A/A*≈4097.51.

Given that A* is 500 mm², so A=500 *4097.51 ≈500 *4097.51 = 2,048,755 mm².

Wait, that can't be right. Because looking at the options, the choices are in the thousands, like up to 7500 mm².

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Let me double-check the formula. Maybe the area ratio is A/A* = [ (gamma +1)/(2*(1 + ((gamma -1)/2)*M^2)) ) ]^{(gamma+1)/(gamma-1)} } * (1/M).

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

A/A* = ( (1/M) ) * [ ( (gamma +1)/2 ) / (1 + (gamma-1)/2 * M^2 ) ) ]^{(gamma+1)/(gamma-1)} }

Wait, that would make sense. Let me re-derive the formula.

From the isentropic flow equations, the area ratio can be expressed as:

A/A* = (1/M) * [ ( (gamma +1)/2 ) / (1 + (gamma-1)/2 * M^2 ) ) ]^{(gamma +1)/(gamma -1)} }

Wait, that seems different from what I did earlier. Let me plug in the values again with this corrected formula.

So gamma=1.4, M=4.

Compute (gamma +1)/2 = 2.4/2 =1.2.

Compute (gamma -1)/2 = 0.4/2=0.2.

So denominator inside the bracket is 1 + 0.2*(M^2) =1 +0.2*16=1+3.2=4.2.

So the fraction is 1.2 /4.2 = (1.2)/(4.2) = 2/7 ≈ 0.285714.

Then, raise this to the (gamma+1)/(gamma-1) power. (gamma+1)/(gamma-1) =2.4/0.4=6.

So (2/7)^6 = (64)/(117649) ≈0.000544.

Wait, that can't be right because then A/A* would be even smaller than 1, but at M=4, the area should be much larger than the throat area.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because for supersonic flow (M>1), the area increases beyond the throat. So if M=4, the area should be larger than A*. So A/A* should be greater than 1.

But according to this calculation, I have (2/7)^6 which is a very small number, leading to a small A/A*. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the terms. Let me think again. The formula for A/A* is given by:

A/A* = [ ( (gamma + 1) / (2 * (1 + (gamma-1)/2 * M²) ) ) ]^{(gamma +1)/(gamma -1)} } * (1/M)

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is:

A/A* = [ ( (gamma + 1) / (2) ) * (1 + (gamma -1)/2 * M²) ) ]^{(gamma +1)/(gamma -1)} } / M

Wait, that's what I did earlier. Then my calculation gave A/A*≈4097.5, which is way bigger than any of the answer choices. Because 500 mm² *4097 is 2,048,500 mm², which is way higher than the options.

So clearly, I must have the wrong formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation for the cross-sectional area in terms of the Mach number. Let me recall that for a nozzle, the area ratio (A/A*) is given by:

A/A* = ( (gamma +1) / (2) )^{ (gamma +1) / (gamma -1) } ) * (1 + ( (gamma -1)/2 ) M^2 )^{ (gamma +1)/(gamma -1) } ) / M

So plugging in the numbers:

gamma=1.4, so (gamma+1)=2.4, (gamma-1)=0.4.

So (gamma+1)/(gamma-1)=6.

Then, (gamma+1)/2 = 1.2.

So the first term is (1.2)^6.

(1.2)^6: Let's compute step by step.

1.2^2=1.44.

1.2^4=(1.44)^2=2.0736.

1.2^6= (1.2^4)*(1.2^2)=2.0736 *1.44 ≈ 2.985984.

Wait, let me compute it accurately.

2.0736 * 1.44:

Multiply 2.0736 by 1.44.

Compute 2 * 1.44=2.88.

0.0736 *1.44=0.105984.

So total 2.88 +0.105984=2.985984.

So (1.2)^6≈2.985984.

Next, (1 + (gamma-1)/2 * M^2 ) = 1 + 0.2 *16 =1+3.2=4.2.

So (4.2)^6.

Compute 4.2^2=17.64.

4.2^3=17.64 *4.2=74.088.

4.2^4=74.088 *4.2=311.5696.

4.2^5=311.5696 *4.2≈1308.59872.

4.2^6≈1308.59872 *4.2≈5497.11704.

So (4.2)^6≈5497.117.

Now, putting it all together:

A/A* = [ (1.2^6) * (4.2^6) ) ] / (M )

Wait no, the formula is ( (1.2) * (4.2) )^6 / M ?

Wait, no, the formula is ( (gamma+1)/2 )^{...} multiplied by (1 + ...)^{...} divided by M.

Wait, the full formula is:

A/A* = [ ( (gamma +1)/2 )^{ (gamma +1)/(gamma -1) } ) * (1 + (gamma-1)/2 M^2 )^{ (gamma +1)/(gamma -1) } ) ] / M

So, substituting the numbers:

A/A* = [ (1.2)^6 * (4.2)^6 ) ] / 4

Because M=4.

Wait, but 1.2^6 is about 2.985984, 4.2^6 is about 5497.117.

Multiply 2.985984 *5497.117 ≈ let's compute 3 *5500 =16500, but since 2.985984 is slightly less than 3, and 4.2^6 is more than 5497, but perhaps approximately 16398.

So 2.985984 *5497.117 ≈ (3-0.014016) *5497.117 = 3*5497.117 - 0.014016*5497.117 ≈ 16491.351 - 77.0 ≈16414.351.

Then divide by 4: 16414.351 /4 ≈4103.5875.

So A/A*≈4103.5875.

So A= A* * 4103.5875.

A* is 500 mm², so A=500 *4103.5875 ≈2,051,793.75 mm².

Wait, this is way bigger than any of the answer options. The options are in the thousands, not millions. So I must have messed up the formula again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

I think I might have confused the formula for the area ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation for the area as a function of Mach number. Another approach is to use the relation that at the test section, the Mach number is 4, so the area there is A, and the area at the throat is A*.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

A/A* = (1/M) * [ ( (gamma +1)/2 ) / (1 + (gamma-1)/2 * M^2 ) ]^{ (gamma +1)/(gamma -1) }

Wait, let's try that.

gamma=1.4, M=4.

Compute (gamma+1)/2 =1.2.

Compute (gamma-1)/2=0.2.

Compute denominator: 1 + 0.2*(4^2)=1+0.2*16=4.2.

So the ratio inside the brackets is 1.2 /4.2 = 0.285714.

Raise this to the (gamma+1)/(gamma-1) power, which is 6.

So (0.285714)^6 ≈ ?

0.285714^2≈0.081632.

^4: (0.081632)^2≈0.006663.

^6
