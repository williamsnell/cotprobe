Question:

Suppose you discovered a new species of bioluminescent worm . How could you prove that it was the worm itself and not some contaminating bacteria that was producing the light ?

Options:

A: Place the worm in a dark environment
B: Measure the light intensity emitted by the worm over time
C: Feed the worm with different food sources
D: Place the light-producing substance in complete growth media or physically examine it under a microscope
E: Perform a chemical analysis of the light-producing substance
F: Expose the worm to high temperatures

Okay, so I just came across this question about bioluminescent worms and proving that the worm itself is producing the light, not some bacteria contaminating it. Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out the best way to approach this. Let me break it down.

The question is asking how to prove that the worm is the one producing the light. So, the main issue here is distinguishing between the worm's own bioluminescence and any potential contamination from bacteria that might also emit light.

Let me think about each option provided. 

Option A: Place the worm in a dark environment. Well, that doesn't seem directly relevant. Putting it in the dark would just allow it to emit light if it can, but how does that prove the source? Both the worm and bacteria would still produce light in the dark, so this doesn't help differentiate.

Option B: Measure the light intensity over time. I'm not sure. Maybe if the light follows a specific pattern, like a certain intensity curve, but bacteria might have their own patterns. Not sure if this alone would prove it's the worm.

Option C: Feed the worm different food sources. Hmm. If the worm's diet affects its bioluminescence, then changing the food might change the light. But if it's bacteria, maybe the light would vary based on the food available to the bacteria. Not a clear way to distinguish the source.

Option D: Place the light-producing substance in complete growth media or examine under a microscope. Oh wait, so if the substance (like the bioluminescent part) is taken from the worm and placed in media, and if it still glows, that suggests it's from the worm. Alternatively, looking under a microscope could show if the light is coming from the worm's cells or from separate bacterial cells. That makes sense because if you isolate the substance, and it's still producing light without the worm, it's likely the worm's own. Or, seeing the light coming directly from the worm's tissues under a microscope would confirm it's not bacteria.

Option E: Perform a chemical analysis of the light-producing substance. That could help identify if the substance is from the worm or bacteria. For example, if the chemical structure matches known worm bioluminescent compounds and not bacterial ones. But this might require knowing specific markers, which could be more complex.

Option F: Expose the worm to high temperatures. High heat might kill the worm but not necessarily the bacteria right away. If the light stops, it suggests the worm was the source. But if the bacteria are heat-resistant, the light might continue, which could help. But this might be a bit tricky and possibly not the most direct method.

So, thinking about the options. Option D seems solid because if you can isolate the substance and it still emits light, it's likely from the worm. Similarly, a microscopic examination could show the light is coming from the worm's own cells, not separate bacteria. 

Option E could also work, but it might be more involved and require specific knowledge of the chemicals. Option F is a possibility but maybe less direct. 

Wait, what's the question again? How to prove it's the worm and not bacteria. So, if you can separate the worm's parts and show the light continues without it, or if the light is seen within the worm's cells, that would do it.

So, the best answer is D. Because placing the substance in media or looking under a microscope would show it's part of the worm's structure, not from bacteria.

To determine whether the bioluminescence is coming from the worm itself or from contaminating bacteria, the most effective approach is to isolate the light-producing substance or directly observe its source. By placing the light-producing substance in complete growth media, one can test if the light emission continues independently of the worm, which would suggest the worm is the source. Alternatively, physically examining the worm under a microscope can reveal whether the light is emanating from the worm's own cells or from separate bacterial cells. This method directly distinguishes between the worm's bioluminescence and bacterial contamination, making it the most reliable option.
