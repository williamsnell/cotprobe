Question:

What is meant by the technically efficient methodof production?

Options:

A: A method that minimizes the time taken to produce a product
B: A method that uses more of all inputs to increase output
C: A method that produces the highest quantity of output
D: A method that relies solely on the latest technology
E: A method that achieves the fastest production speed regardless of resource usage
F: A method that uses a balanced mix of labor and capital
G: A method of production is technically efficient if there is no other method that maintains the same level of output using less of one factor input without increasing another.
H: A method that uses the least amount of resources
I: A method that maximizes profit
J: A method that focuses on the quality of the product rather than the quantity or resource usage

Okay, so I have this question about production methods and technical efficiency. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that technical efficiency has something to do with how well resources are used. Let me think.

The question is asking what "technically efficient method of production" means. The options are from A to J. I need to pick the right one.

Let me go through each option. 

Option A says it minimizes the time to produce. I don't think that's it. Time could be part of efficiency, but it's not the whole picture. Technical efficiency is more about resources than just time.

Option B mentions using more of all inputs to increase output. That sounds like it's the opposite of efficiency. Using more inputs would be inefficient because you're not getting more output per resource.

Option C is about producing the highest quantity. That might relate to productivity but not necessarily efficiency. You could produce a lot but still not be efficient if you use a lot of resources.

Option D relies solely on the latest technology. While technology can help, technical efficiency isn't just about having the newest tech. It's more about optimal resource use.

Option E is about the fastest production speed regardless of resources. That doesn't sound efficient because it might waste resources.

Option F suggests a balanced mix of labor and capital. That's more about choosing the right combination, maybe in terms of cost efficiency, but not specifically technical efficiency.

Option G says a method is technically efficient if no other method can maintain the same output with less of one input without increasing another. Oh wait, that sounds familiar. I think technical efficiency is when you can't reduce one input without either reducing output or increasing another input. So it's like being on the production frontier.

Option H is using the least resources. That's close, but maybe too simplistic. It's not just about using the least; it's about not being able to produce the same output with fewer resources.

Option I is about maximizing profit. Profit maximization depends on both cost and revenue, not just technical efficiency.

Option J focuses on product quality. That's more about product quality rather than production efficiency.

So the correct answer should be G. It's the definition where you can't have the same output with less of one input without increasing another, meaning you're using resources optimally.

The correct answer is:

G: A method of production is technically efficient if there is no other method that maintains the same level of output using less of one factor input without increasing another.

Answer: G
