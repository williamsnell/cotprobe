Question:

A shoe factory has fixed costs of $1200 per day, and variable costs of $1.50 per shoe. Find a linear cost function to represent their daily costs.

Options:

A: Cost = 1200 + X
B: Cost = 1500 + 1.5 X
C: Cost = 1200 + 1.5 X
D: Cost = 1200 + 1.75 X
E: Cost = 1000 + 2 X
F: Cost = 1200 + 2 X
G: Cost = 1200 + 0.75 X
H: Cost = 1100 + 1.25 X
I: Cost = 1300 + 1.5 X
J: Cost = 1000 + 1.5 X

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shoe factory's costs, and I'm supposed to find the right linear cost function from the given options. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my classes.

Alright, so the problem says the factory has fixed costs of $1200 per day. Fixed costs are the expenses that don't change regardless of how many shoes they make, right? Like rent, salaries, maybe some utilities that are the same every day. So that's the starting point of the cost function.

Then there's the variable costs, which are $1.50 per shoe. Variable costs depend on the number of units produced. So the more shoes they make, the higher the variable costs. That makes sense because things like materials and direct labor would increase with each shoe produced.

So a linear cost function is usually in the form C(X) = F + V*X, where F is the fixed cost and V is the variable cost per unit. Here, F is $1200, and V is $1.50.

Putting that together, the equation should be C(X) = 1200 + 1.5X. Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Fixed costs come first, then variable times the number of shoes, which is X here.

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that: 1200 + 1.5 X. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option A is 1200 + X, which would mean variable cost is $1 per shoe, but the problem says $1.50, so A is out. Option B has 1500 fixed costs, which is higher than what's given. Option C matches, so that's probably the right one.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. It's straightforward once I remember the structure of the cost function. Fixed plus variable times quantity.

The correct answer is based on the structure of a linear cost function, which is **C(X) = Fixed Costs + (Variable Cost per Unit Ã— Number of Units)**. Here, the fixed costs are $1200, and the variable cost per shoe is $1.50. Substituting these values into the formula gives **C(X) = 1200 + 1.5X**. 

Option C matches this equation exactly. Other options either have incorrect fixed costs, incorrect variable costs, or both. 

Answer: C
