Okay, so I've got this question here about Carol and Jim, who are having marital difficulties, and they have two school-aged kids, a boy and a girl. The question is about the relationship between marital discord and child behavior problems, based on a meta-analysis of research. Hmm, I need to figure out what the expected outcome is.

I remember from my psychology classes that when parents are fighting or having marital problems, it can affect their children. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics, like whether it affects boys and girls differently. Wait, I think there's something about gender differences in how kids react to stressors like marital discord.

So, the options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one. Option A says the girl is more likely than the boy to have immediate behavior problems. I'm not sure if girls are more affected. I think maybe girls might internalize more, like anxiety or depression, while boys might act out more, leading to externalizing behaviors.

Option B is the opposite, the boy less likely than the girl. That doesn't sound right because I thought boys might have more external issues, so maybe more behavior problems. So B might not be correct.

Option C says neither child is more likely than kids from stable marriages. That can't be right because I remember that marital discord does have an impact on children's behavior.

Option D says neither child is expected to have any problems. No, that's not accurate because the research shows there's a correlation, so D is out.

Option E states the boy is more likely than the girl. That aligns with what I was thinking earlierâ€”boys might exhibit more external behavior issues when there's marital conflict.

Option F says both are less likely than kids from stable homes. Wait, that can't be because the question is about marital difficulties, which should increase behavior issues, not decrease. So F is probably wrong.

Option G says neither is less likely than stable marriages. That's confusing. I think it's the opposite; their problems are more likely, so G is incorrect.

Option H is the girl less likely than the boy. If boys are more affected, then this would be correct, but wait, no. I thought boys are more likely to have problems, so H would say girls are less, which is correct if E is right.

Wait, no, E says the boy is more likely. So if E is correct, H would be incorrect because H says the girl is less likely than the boy, which is actually correct as well. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let me clarify. If the boy is more likely to have behavior problems, then option E says that, and H says the girl is less likely than the boy. So both E and H are correct statements, but the question is about which option is correct.

Wait, the question is asking according to the meta-analysis, what is expected. So maybe the meta-analysis shows that boys and girls are affected differently. Let me think again.

I recall that boys tend to exhibit more externalizing behaviors, like aggression or conduct issues, when there's family conflict. Girls might show more internalizing issues, like anxiety or depression, which might not be as immediately noticeable as behavior problems. So, in terms of immediate behavior problems, boys might be more likely.

So looking back at the options, E says the boy is more likely than the girl, which aligns with that. So E would be the correct answer.

But wait, let me check other options. Option I says both are equally likely. If the meta-analysis shows no gender difference, then I might be wrong. But I think the research suggests that gender does play a role, with boys being more vulnerable in some aspects.

Option J talks about delayed problems, but the question is about immediate behavior problems, so J isn't the right fit.

So putting it all together, the answer should be E. The boy is more likely than the girl to manifest immediate behavior problems.

The question examines the relationship between marital discord and child behavior problems, specifically whether there are gender differences in how school-aged children (a boy and a girl) are affected. Research suggests that marital difficulties can impact children's behavior, with boys often exhibiting more externalizing behaviors (e.g., aggression, conduct issues) and girls more likely to internalize problems (e.g., anxiety, depression). Since the question focuses on immediate behavior problems, boys are generally more likely to manifest these than girls.

Analyzing the options:
- **A** and **H** are contradictory and do not align with the idea that boys are more likely to exhibit immediate behavior problems.
- **B** and **D** are incorrect because they suggest boys are less likely or no problems at all, which contradicts the research.
- **C**, **F**, and **G** are incorrect because they imply no difference or lower likelihood compared to children from stable marriages, which is not supported by the research.
- **E** aligns with the research, as it states that the boy is more likely than the girl to manifest immediate behavior problems.
- **I** is incorrect because it suggests equal likelihood, which does not account for gender differences.
- **J** is irrelevant because it focuses on delayed problems, not immediate ones.

Thus, the correct answer is **E**: the boy is more likely than the girl to manifest an immediate behavior problem.

Answer: E
