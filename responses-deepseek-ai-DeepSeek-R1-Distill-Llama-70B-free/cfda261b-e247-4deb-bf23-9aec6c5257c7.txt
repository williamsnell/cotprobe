Okay, so I've got this problem about depreciation, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The Business Education Department bought 24 typewriters at $350 each. The estimated life is four years, and each typewriter has a disposal value of $75. There are four parts to the question: a, b, c, d. I'll tackle each one by one.

Starting with part (a): What's the annual depreciation using the straight-line method. I remember that straight-line depreciation is pretty straightforward. You take the cost minus the salvage value, divide by the useful life. So for each typewriter, the cost is $350, and after 4 years, it's worth $75. So the annual depreciation would be (350 - 75)/4. Let me calculate that: 275 divided by 4 is 68.75. So that's $68.75 per year per typewriter. Wait, but looking at the options, option D has $68.75 as the first answer, so that might be the right choice. But I should check the other parts too.

Part (b) asks for the monthly depreciation. So if the annual is $68.75, dividing by 12 months would give the monthly. 68.75 divided by 12... Let me do the division. 68.75 ÷12. Hmm, 12*5 is 60, so that leaves 8.75. 8.75/12 is about 0.729. So total is 5.729, approximately $5.73 per month. Looking back at the options, D says $5.73, which matches. So that's a good sign.

Part (c): The annual rate of depreciation during the first year. Hmm, okay. I'm a bit confused about this part. Wait, the rate here probably refers to the percentage of depreciation. But in straight-line, the depreciation is the same each year. So the rate would be (depreciation per year)/(original cost) * 100. So that's 68.75 / 350 * 100. Let me calculate that. 68.75 divided by 350. Let's see, 350 goes into 68.75 about 0.196 times. So 19.6%. So the annual rate is 19.6%. Checking the options, D has 19.6%, so that fits.

Part (d): The book value at the end of the third year. Book value is the original cost minus accumulated depreciation. So each year, we deduct $68.75. After three years, the accumulated depreciation is 3 * 68.75 = 206.25. So book value is 350 - 206.25 = 143.75. Looking at the options, D says $143.75, which matches.

So putting it all together, option D seems to be the correct answer for all parts. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

For part (a): (350 -75) = 275. 275/4 = 68.75. Yep, that's right. 

Part (b): 68.75 /12 is 5.729, which we round to 5.73. Correct.

Part (c): (68.75 /350)*100 = (0.19642857)*100 ≈19.6%. Correct.

Part (d): 3 years *68.75 = 206.25. 350-206.25=143.75. Correct.

So all the parts match option D. I think that's the right choice.

To solve the problem, we calculate each part step by step using the straight-line depreciation method:

1. **Annual Depreciation (Part a):**  
   The annual depreciation is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Useful Life}} = \frac{350 - 75}{4} = \frac{275}{4} = 68.75
   \]  
   So, the annual depreciation is **$68.75**.

2. **Monthly Depreciation (Part b):**  
   To find the monthly depreciation, divide the annual depreciation by 12:  
   \[
   \text{Monthly Depreciation} = \frac{68.75}{12} \approx 5.73
   \]  
   Thus, the monthly depreciation is approximately **$5.73**.

3. **Annual Rate of Depreciation (Part c):**  
   The annual rate of depreciation is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Depreciation Rate} = \left(\frac{\text{Annual Depreciation}}{\text{Original Cost}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{68.75}{350}\right) \times 100 \approx 19.6\%
   \]  
   Therefore, the annual rate of depreciation is **19.6%**.

4. **Book Value at the End of the Third Year (Part d):**  
   The book value is the original cost minus the accumulated depreciation over three years:  
   \[
   \text{Accumulated Depreciation} = 3 \times 68.75 = 206.25
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Book Value} = 350 - 206.25 = 143.75
   \]  
   Hence, the book value at the end of the third year is **$143.75**.

All calculations match the values provided in **Option D**.
