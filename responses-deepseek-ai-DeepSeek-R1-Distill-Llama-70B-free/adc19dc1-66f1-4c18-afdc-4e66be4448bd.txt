Question:

A man and a woman were passengers on a plane. They were seated next to one another in the first- class section of the plane. Midway through the flight, the woman excused herself and went to the restroom. While she was gone, the man rummaged through the woman's purse and stole $100 in cash. Unknown to the man, a flight attendant saw him steal the money. As is customary in such situations, the flight attendant radioed ahead, and police officers arrested the man when the plane landed. The man was subsequently charged with violating an applicable federal larceny statute. During the trial, the prosecuting attorney called the man's wife as a willing witness against her husband. She proposed to testify that the man confided to her that he did steal the woman's money during the flight. The man's attorney objected on the grounds of hearsay and privilege. The wife's proposed testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, because it is privileged, though it is not hearsay.
B: admissible, because it is neither hearsay nor privileged.
C: admissible, because it is hearsay within a recognized exception and not privileged.
D: inadmissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
E: admissible, both because it discloses a privileged communication and because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
F: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception, and it discloses a privileged communication.
G: inadmissible, because it discloses a privileged communication, though it is not hearsay.
H: admissible, both because it does not disclose a privileged communication and because it is hearsay within a recognized exception.
I: inadmissible, because it is hearsay within a recognized exception, though it is not privileged.
J: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception, though it is not privileged.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here about whether a wife's testimony against her husband is admissible. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

The situation is that a man stole $100 from a woman's purse on a plane. A flight attendant saw him and called the police, so he was arrested. Now, he's on trial for larceny. The prosecution is calling his wife as a witness, and she's willing to testify that he confessed to her about stealing the money. The defense attorney is objecting on hearsay and privilege grounds. I need to figure out if her testimony is admissible and why.

First, I remember that hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So the wife's testimony about what her husband told her would be an out-of-court statement, right? Because he's telling her something outside of court. So that's hearsay unless there's an exception.

Now, looking at the exceptions to hearsay. I think the main ones relevant here might be the statement against interest exception or perhaps a statement by a party opponent. Wait, the statement against interest is where the declarant's statement is against their own interest at the time it was made. If the husband told his wife he stole, that would be against his interest because it could subject him to liability. So that might qualify as an exception under FRE 804(b)(3).

But wait, another thing comes to mind: the marital communication privilege. The idea that spouses can't be forced to testify against each other, and their communications are privileged. So even if the statement is hearsay, if it's a privileged communication, the wife can't be compelled to testify about it. But in this case, the wife is a willing witness. So how does that affect things?

I remember that the marital privilege can be invoked by either spouse to prevent the other from testifying about their confidential communications. But if the witness spouse (the wife) is willing to testify, does that mean she's waiving the privilege? Or is the privilege absolute, meaning that even if she wants to testify, she can't?

Hmm, I think the marital communication privilege is a bit tricky. The general rule is that either spouse can assert the privilege to prevent the other from disclosing confidential communications made during the marriage. But if the witness spouse is willing to testify, that might mean she's choosing not to invoke the privilege, so the communication isn't privileged in this context. Or maybe the court would still uphold the privilege regardless of her willingness.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Some jurisdictions might hold that the witness can choose to testify, thereby waiving the privilege. Others might say the privilege exists regardless of the spouse's willingness. So I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think again. The Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 501 states that privilege issues are governed by the principles of the common law, except in cases where State law provides the rule of decision for an element of the claim or defense. Since this is a federal larceny case, I think common law applies. At common law, the marital communication privilege applies, and either spouse can prevent the other from testifying about their confidential communications. But if the wife is willing to testify, does that mean she's not invoking the privilege, so the testimony is allowed?

Wait, but the defense attorney is objecting on the grounds of hearsay and privilege. So the objection is about both, meaning the prosecution has to overcome both hurdles.

So first, the hearsay issue: the statement is hearsay, but it might fall under an exception. If the husband's statement is a statement against his interest, then under FRE 804(b)(3), it's admissible if the declarant is unavailable. But wait, the husband is the defendant, and he's present in court. So he's available as a witness. Therefore, the statement against interest exception wouldn't apply because the declarant (the husband) is available to testify. So that exception is out.

Is there another hearsay exception that applies? Maybe the excited utterance under 803(2)? But the husband's confession to his wife doesn't seem to be made under the stress of the event. It's during the flight, but after the fact, so probably not. 

What about the statement by a party opponent? Under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's agent or the party himself. Wait, but the statement is by the party (the defendant) against himself, so it's a party admission. So that would make it non-hearsay under 801(d)(2)(A). Wait, no, the wife is testifying about the husband's statement, which would be a statement by a party-opponent. So that falls under 801(d)(2)(A)(i), which makes it non-hearsay. Because it's a statement offered against the party (the husband) made by him. So the statement wouldn't be hearsay at all. 

Wait, I think I might have mixed up something. The statement is being offered by the prosecution against the defendant. The defendant made the statement to his wife. So the statement is being offered against the party (the defendant) and is his own statement, so it's a party admission, which is non-hearsay. So the hearsay objection wouldn't apply here because it's not hearsay. So that takes care of that part.

But then there's the privilege issue. The defense is also objecting on grounds of marital privilege. So even if it's not hearsay, it might still be inadmissible if it's a privileged communication. So the question is, is the statement protected by marital communication privilege?

Under the common law, the marital communication privilege covers confidential statements made between spouses during the marriage. The purpose is to protect the confidentiality of marital communications. So if the husband told his wife about the theft, that's a confidential communication. 

But the wife is willing to testify about it. Does her willingness mean she's waiving the privilege? Or does the privilege exist regardless of her willingness? I think that the marital communication privilege is held by both spouses, meaning either can assert it. But if the wife is willing to testify, she is choosing not to assert the privilege, so the testimony would be admissible on that ground. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Some sources say that the marital communication privilege can be waived by the testifying spouse. So if the wife is willing to testify, she's effectively waiving the privilege, making the communication admissible.

Alternatively, some might argue that the privilege can't be waived by the testifying spouse because the other spouse (the defendant) might still have the right to assert it. But I think that's more about the spousal testimonial privilege, which is the right not to testify against your spouse. The marital communication privilege is about the content of the communications. So perhaps the wife can choose to testify about it, thereby waiving the communication privilege.

So putting it all together: the statement is non-hearsay because it's a party admission (801(d)(2)). As for privilege, the wife's testimony about the confidential communication would normally be privileged, but if she's willing to testify, she's waiving that privilege. Therefore, the testimony is admissible on both groundsâ€”it's not hearsay and any privilege has been waived.

Wait, but wait another moment. If the statement is non-hearsay, then the hearsay objection is overcome. And if the privilege doesn't apply because the wife is willing to testify, then the only objection is overruled. So the testimony is admissible.

So looking at the options:

Option B says admissible because it's neither hearsay nor privileged. But wait, is the communication still privileged? If the wife is willing, does that mean it's not privileged anymore? Or does the privilege still apply regardless of her willingness, making the testimony inadmissible?

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The marital communication privilege is a separate issue from spousal immunity. The communication privilege applies to confidential communications made during the marriage. The wife's testimony would disclose such a communication. But if she's willing to testify, does that mean she's waived the privilege?

In federal courts, the Supreme Court case of Trammel v. United States (1980) held that the accused spouse may assert the testimonial privilege, but the testifying spouse may choose to testify without violating the privilege. Wait, no, Trammel was about the spousal testimonial privilege, not the marital communication privilege. Trammel said that the witness spouse could choose to testify against the defendant spouse, thereby abrogating the common law rule that one spouse couldn't testify against the other. So Trammel dealt with the testimonial privilege, not the communication privilege.

So Trammel allows the wife to testify against her husband if she wishes, but what about the content of their communications? The marital communication privilege is still a separate issue, I think. 

So, the wife's proposed testimony is about a confidential marital communication. The question is whether she can be compelled to disclose it, or whether she can choose to disclose it. At common law, the marital communication privilege could be invoked by either spouse. So even if the wife wanted to testify, the husband could assert the privilege to prevent her from doing so. But does that apply here?

Wait, but the husband is the defendant, and he's the one objecting. So he's asserting the privilege to prevent his wife from testifying about their confidential communication. If the common law holds that the husband can assert the privilege to prevent the wife from testifying, then the testimony would be inadmissible despite her willingness.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to find the right approach. 

In federal courts, the marital communication privilege is recognized. (See Wolfe v. United States, 291 U.S. 7 (1934)). The Supreme Court has held that confidential communications between spouses made during marriage are privileged and cannot be disclosed in court over the objection of the communicating spouse. 

So in this case, the husband is the communicating spouse, and he's objecting. The wife is the receiving spouse who is willing to testify. But under the common law, both spouses have the right to claim the privilege. So even if the wife is willing, the husband can assert the privilege to prevent her testimony. Therefore, the testimony would be inadmissible because it's a privileged communication.

Wait, but that seems to conflict with Trammel, which dealt with the testimonial privilege. Trammel said that the testifying spouse could choose to testify, but that was about being compelled to testify, not about the content of the communication. So the marital communication privilege is a separate issue. So even if the wife is willing, the husband can still prevent her from disclosing the communication.

So if that's the case, then the testimony is inadmissible because it discloses a privileged communication. But earlier, I thought the statement was non-hearsay because it's a party admission. So the hearsay objection wouldn't apply, but the privilege objection would.

Wait, so if the statement is admissible as a party admission (non-hearsay), but the content is protected by marital communication privilege, making it inadmissible. So the testimony is inadmissible because it's privileged, even though it's not hearsay.

So looking back at the options, let's see.

Option G says inadmissible because it discloses a privileged communication, though it is not hearsay. That seems to fit. Because the statement is non-hearsay (party admission), but the content is privileged.

Alternatively, option D says inadmissible because it discloses a privileged communication and because it's hearsay not within any exception. But since we determined it's non-hearsay, D is incorrect.

Option F says inadmissible because it's hearsay not within any exception and discloses a privileged communication. Again, since it's non-hearsay, F is incorrect.

Option G seems correct: inadmissible because it discloses a privileged communication, though it is not hearsay.

Wait, but earlier I thought the hearsay objection was overcome because it's a party admission, making it non-hearsay. So then the hearsay issue is resolved, but the privilege remains. So the testimony is inadmissible solely because of the privilege.

So the correct answer would be G: inadmissible, because it discloses a privileged communication, though it is not hearsay.

The question revolves around the admissibility of the wife's testimony regarding her husband's confession to stealing $100 during a flight. The defense objected on grounds of hearsay and privilege, and the analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Hearsay Analysis**:  
   The wife's testimony about the husband's confession is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, making it hearsay. However, under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(2)(A), a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against a party and was made by the party himself (a party admission). Since the husband's confession to his wife is a statement by the defendant himself, it qualifies as a party admission and is therefore not hearsay.

2. **Privilege Analysis**:  
   The marital communication privilege protects confidential communications made between spouses during the marriage. Under common law, as recognized by federal courts, either spouse can assert this privilege to prevent the disclosure of such communications. In this case, the husband, as the communicating spouse, objected to the testimony, asserting the privilege. Although the wife is willing to testify, the husband's objection based on the marital communication privilege takes precedence. The Supreme Court's decision in *Trammel v. United States* (1980) addressed the spousal testimonial privilege, not the marital communication privilege, and does not override the husband's right to assert the privilege in this context.

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The testimony is inadmissible because it discloses a privileged communication, even though it is not hearsay. The hearsay objection is overcome due to the party admission exception, but the privilege objection prevails, making the testimony inadmissible.

**Correct Answer: G**  
Inadmissible, because it discloses a privileged communication, though it is not hearsay.
