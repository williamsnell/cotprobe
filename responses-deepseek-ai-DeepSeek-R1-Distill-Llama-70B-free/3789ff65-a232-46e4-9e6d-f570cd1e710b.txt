Question:

A testator died and through his will gave his entire estate to charity, but the gift failed because the will was executed 10 days prior to the testator's death. A man then filed a claim against the estate, alleging that he was the son and heir of the testator. At the trial on the man's claim, the man was unable to produce any proof of a ceremonial marriage, but established the following by undisputed evidence: (a) that his mother and the testator had cohabited for a number of years; and (b) that his mother had predeceased the testator by one day. Assume that this jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the man's attorney called a clerk at a winter resort hotel. The clerk testified that the testator and the man's mother had come to the hotel for many years and he often saw the testator sign the hotel register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator. "The trial court should rule the clerk's testimony

Options:

A: inadmissible, under the Dead Man's Statute.
B: inadmissible, because it is a violation of the testator's privacy.
C: admissible as a pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.
D: admissible, as it falls under the exception to the hearsay rule for statements of personal or family history.
E: admissible, because it provides evidence of the couple's public recognition as husband and wife.
F: inadmissible, because the clerk's testimony is not the best evidence.
G: inadmissible, because the clerk's testimony is considered hearsay.
H: admissible, as it provides evidence of a common law marriage.
I: admissible, because the clerk had personal knowledge of the matter.
J: inadmissible, as the hotel register is not a legal document establishing marriage.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the admissibility of certain testimony under the Dead Man's Statute and hearsay exceptions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: A testator dies, leaving his estate to charity, but the will's gift fails because it was executed too close to his death. Now, a man is claiming to be the testator's son and heir. At trial, he can't produce proof of a ceremonial marriage between his mother and the testator. However, he presents evidence that they cohabited for years and that his mother died just a day before the testator.

The man's attorney calls a hotel clerk who testifies that the testator and the mother came to the hotel for many years, and the testator often signed the register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator." The question is about whether this testimony is admissible.

I remember that the Dead Man's Statute (also known as the Deceased Person's Statute) generally prohibits a party from testifying about a personal transaction or communication with the deceased that the other party is unable to contradict. So if the testator is dead, and the man is trying to prove something based on the testator's actions or statements, the statute might apply.

But wait, the clerk isn't testifying about a statement made by the testator. He's recounting the testator's actions—signing the register a certain way. So, is that a statement, or is it conduct?

Hearsay is another issue. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Here, the clerk is testifying about what the testator wrote on the register. Is that a statement? Yes, because it's an assertion. So, it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Looking at hearsay exceptions: There's the exception for statements concerning personal or family history. That's covered under Federal Rule 803(27) or similar state rules. Such statements are admissible if they're made by a person with knowledge, and they concern the declarant's personal or family history, and they're not subject to easy fabrication.

In this case, the testator's act of signing as Mr. and Mrs. Testator could be seen as a statement about their marital status. So, it might fall under the family history exception. Also, it could be considered a pedigree exception, which allows statements about family lineage, marriage, etc.

But wait, the Dead Man's Statute might still apply. The clerk's testimony is about the testator's actions, which could be considered a transaction with the deceased. However, the Dead Man's Statute often applies when the surviving party is testifying about a conversation or transaction with the deceased. Here, the clerk is a third party, so maybe the statute doesn't apply. Because the issue is whether the clerk, as a witness, is testifying about a transaction with the deceased. Since the clerk is not a party, perhaps the Dead Man's Statute doesn't bar the testimony.

Alternatively, the clerk's testimony is about the testator's actions, which might not fall under the Dead Man's Statute's prohibition because it's not the opponent (the estate) trying to introduce their own statements, but a third party.

So, the testimony is hearsay but might be admissible under the family history exception. Alternatively, it's not barred by the Dead Man's Statute because the clerk isn't a party.

Looking at the options. Option E says it's admissible because it shows public recognition as husband and wife. That makes sense because if they presented themselves as married, that's evidence of a common-law marriage or at least cohabitation. Option D says it's under the family history exception. Option H suggests it's for common-law marriage, but I'm not sure if that's the applicable exception here.

Wait, common-law marriage is a legal concept where cohabitation and public recognition as spouses can establish marriage without a ceremony. If the clerk's testimony shows that the testator held them out as married, that could support a common-law marriage claim, which would make the man an heir.

But I'm a bit confused about whether this testimony is hearsay. Since the testator's signing of the register is an assertion that they were married, it's hearsay. Unless an exception applies. The family history exception seems applicable here because it's about their marital status, which is part of family history.

Option D says it's admissible under the exception for statements of personal or family history. That seems correct. Alternatively, Option E says it's admissible because it shows public recognition, which is more about the fact of their relationship rather than hearsay.

Wait, but the clerk's testimony is about the testator's statements, which are hearsay. So, the testimony's admissibility hinges on whether it's hearsay and if an exception applies. If it's not hearsay, then it's admissible.

Alternatively, if the clerk is testifying about what he observed—that the testator signed as Mr. and Mrs.—then maybe it's not hearsay because it's not offered to prove the truth of the matter (that they were married), but just to show that the testator held them out as married, which is relevant to establish their relationship. Wait, but the purpose is to show that they were married, so it is for the truth of the matter. So, it's hearsay.

So, the hearsay objection would apply unless an exception is available. The family history exception would allow it. So, the answer would be D or E.

Option E suggests it's admissible because it's evidence of public recognition. That might be under a different theory, not necessarily a hearsay exception. But if the testimony is hearsay, then E might not address that. So, the correct reasoning is that it's hearsay but falls under the family history exception, making D correct.

Wait, but another angle: the clerk's testimony is about the testator's actions, not statements. But signing the register is a statement. So it's hearsay.

So, the options are between D and E. Let me look back at the options.

Option D: admissible as statements of personal or family history. Option E: admissible because it's evidence of public recognition as husband and wife.

Which one is the better fit? The family history exception (D) would apply because it's about the testator's marital status. Option E is more about the fact of their relationship, which could be non-hearsay if it's about reputation or common knowledge, but the clerk is testifying about specific instances, not reputation.

Alternatively, the testimony could be admissible as evidence of the couple's reputation as being married, which is a separate hearsay exception under 803(21) for reputation concerning family history. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

But the clerk is testifying about specific instances of the testator signing the register, not about the general reputation in the community. So, it's more about specific acts, which would be hearsay unless under an exception.

So, I think the correct answer is D: admissible under the family history exception.

Wait, but another thought: The Dead Man's Statute might prevent the clerk from testifying about transactions with the deceased. But in this case, the clerk is testifying about the testator's actions, not about a transaction between the clerk and the testator. Or is it? Because the clerk is the one who saw the testator sign the register.

Wait, the Dead Man's Statute typically applies when a party is testifying about a transaction with the deceased. Here, the clerk is a third-party witness, not a party. So, the Dead Man's Statute wouldn't apply to him. Therefore, the testimony isn't barred by that statute.

So, the issue is whether the testimony is hearsay. Since it is, but falls under the family history exception, it's admissible. So, the answer is D.

Looking back at the options, option D says: admissible as it falls under the exception to the hearsay rule for statements of personal or family history.

Option E says admissible because it's evidence of public recognition. That's more about substantive evidence, not addressing the hearsay issue. So, without an exception, E wouldn't solve the hearsay problem.

So, the correct answer should be D.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a hotel clerk's testimony regarding the testator's practice of signing the hotel register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator." The key issues are whether the testimony is barred by the Dead Man's Statute and whether it constitutes hearsay. If it is hearsay, an exception must apply for it to be admissible.

1. **Dead Man's Statute**: This statute generally prohibits a party from testifying about a personal transaction or communication with the deceased when the opposing party is unable to contradict the testimony. However, in this case, the clerk is a third-party witness, not a party to the litigation. Therefore, the Dead Man's Statute does not bar the testimony.

2. **Hearsay**: The clerk's testimony about the testator signing the register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator" is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the testator and the man's mother were married). As such, it constitutes hearsay. For the testimony to be admissible, a hearsay exception must apply.

3. **Hearsay Exception**: The testimony falls under the exception for statements of personal or family history (e.g., Federal Rule of Evidence 803(27)). The testator's act of signing the register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator" is a statement concerning the testator's marital status, which is a matter of personal history. This exception allows such statements to be admitted if they are made by a person with knowledge and are not subject to easy fabrication.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The testimony is not barred by the Dead Man's Statute because the clerk is a third-party witness.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The testimony does not violate the testator's privacy; it is relevant to establishing the testator's marital status.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. While the testimony relates to family history, it is more specifically covered by the exception for statements of personal or family history, not the broader pedigree exception.
   - **Option D**: Correct. The testimony is admissible under the hearsay exception for statements of personal or family history.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. While the testimony provides evidence of public recognition, this does not address the hearsay issue. The testimony is admissible because it falls under a hearsay exception, not merely because it shows public recognition.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The "best evidence" rule is not applicable here because the testimony is about the testator's actions, not the contents of the hotel register.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. While the testimony is hearsay, it is admissible under a hearsay exception.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The testimony does not directly establish a common-law marriage; it is admissible as evidence of the testator's representation of marital status.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. The testimony is not inadmissible simply because the hotel register is not a legal document; it is admissible under a hearsay exception.

The correct answer is that the testimony is admissible under the hearsay exception for statements of personal or family history.

**Answer: D**
