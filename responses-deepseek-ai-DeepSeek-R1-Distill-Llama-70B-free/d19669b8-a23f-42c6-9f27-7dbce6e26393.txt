Question:

As punishment for bad behavior during recess, Mrs. Busywork asked her class to multiply 10 by $\frac{1}{3}$ five times. John, however, notices that it is possible to multiply 10 by a single fraction and still get the same answer as the other students. What is this single fraction?

Options:

A: \frac{1}{243}
B: \frac{1}{2}
C: \frac{1}{729}
D: \frac{1}{100}
E: \frac{1}{3}
F: \frac{1}{27}
G: \frac{1}{68}
H: \frac{1}{64}
I: \frac{1}{125}
J: \frac{1}{81}

Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Mrs. Busywork made her class multiply 10 by 1/3 five times as punishment. But John noticed that instead of doing it five times, he can just multiply 10 by a single fraction and get the same result. I need to find what that single fraction is.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that when you multiply a number by a fraction multiple times, it's like raising that fraction to the power of the number of times you're multiplying. So, if they're multiplying by 1/3 five times, that's the same as (1/3)^5.

Wait, let me make sure. So, 10 multiplied by 1/3 once is 10*(1/3). Twice would be 10*(1/3)*(1/3) = 10*(1/3)^2. So yeah, five times would be 10*(1/3)^5. So, the single fraction would be (1/3)^5.

Calculating (1/3)^5. Let's do that. 3^5 is 3*3=9, 9*3=27, 27*3=81, 81*3=243. So, 3^5 is 243. Therefore, (1/3)^5 is 1/243. So the single fraction is 1/243.

Looking at the options, option A is 1/243. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it: 10*(1/3)^5 = 10/243. So the fraction that when multiplied by 10 gives the same result is 1/243. Yep, that makes sense.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So I'm confident the answer is A.

The problem involves determining a single fraction that, when multiplied by 10, yields the same result as multiplying 10 by $\frac{1}{3}$ five times. 

When multiplying a number by a fraction multiple times, it is equivalent to raising that fraction to the power of the number of multiplications. Specifically, multiplying 10 by $\frac{1}{3}$ five times is equivalent to $10 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^5$. 

Calculating $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^5$:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^5 = \frac{1^5}{3^5} = \frac{1}{243}.
\]

Thus, the single fraction is $\frac{1}{243}$. Among the given options, $\frac{1}{243}$ corresponds to option A.

Answer: A
