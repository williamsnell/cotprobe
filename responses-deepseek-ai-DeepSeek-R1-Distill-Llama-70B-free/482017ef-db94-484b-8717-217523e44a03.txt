Okay, so I've got this math problem here about calculating the total cost of some magazines and books. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the question says that each magazine costs $2.99 and each book costs $6.99. I need to find out how much 4 magazines and 3 books would cost in total. Hmm, sounds straightforward, but I should make sure I do each step correctly to avoid mistakes.

First, I'll calculate the cost of the magazines. Since each is $2.99 and I'm buying 4, I can multiply 2.99 by 4. Let me think about that. 2.99 times 4... Well, 2 times 4 is 8. Then 0.99 times 4 is 3.96. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, no, 2.99 is the same as 3 minus 0.01. So maybe a better way is to think of it as 3 dollars minus a penny per magazine. So 4 magazines would be 4 times 3, which is 12, minus 4 times 0.01, which is 0.04. So 12 - 0.04 is $11.96. Let me check that again. Alternatively, I can just do 2.99 * 4. Let me calculate it directly: 2.99 *4. 2*4=8. 0.99*4=3.96. So 8+3.96 is 11.96. Yep, that's correct.

Next, I need to calculate the cost of the books. Each book is $6.99 and I'm buying 3. So 6.99 *3. Let me compute that. 6 *3 is 18, and 0.99*3 is 2.97. So adding those together, 18 + 2.97 equals $20.97. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check another way. 6.99 is almost 7, so 7*3 is 21. But since it's 0.01 less per book, three books would be 0.03 less than 21. So 21 - 0.03 is 20.97. Yep, that's correct.

Now, I need to add the cost of the magazines and the books together. So the magazines were $11.96 and the books were $20.97. Adding those together: 11.96 + 20.97. Let me compute that. 11 +20 is 31, and 0.96 +0.97 is 1.93. So 31 +1.93 is 32.93. Wait, that's $32.93. Let me double-check that sum. 11.96 plus 20.97. Adding the dollars first: 11 +20 =31. Then the cents: 96 +97. Hmm, 96+97 is 193 cents, which is $1.93. So 31 +1.93 is indeed 32.93. So the total cost should be $32.93.

Looking at the options, option B is $32.93. So that's the correct answer.

The total cost is calculated by multiplying the cost per magazine by 4 and the cost per book by 3, then summing the results. 

- Cost of 4 magazines: \(4 \times 2.99 = 11.96\)
- Cost of 3 books: \(3 \times 6.99 = 20.97\)
- Total: \(11.96 + 20.97 = 32.93\)

The correct answer is option B: $32.93.
