Okay, so I have this physics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: A heavy rock and a light rock in free fall (zero air resistance) have the same acceleration. The heavy rock doesn't have a greater acceleration because the... and then there are the options.

Hmm. I remember from my physics class that when objects are in free fall, they accelerate at the same rate, assuming there's no air resistance. But why is that? I think it's because the acceleration due to gravity is the same for all objects, regardless of their mass. Oh right, that's what Galileo figured out, right? He did that experiment with the Leaning Tower of Pisa or something like that.

So the key here is understanding why both rocks have the same acceleration. I think it's because the force of gravity acting on each is different, but their masses are different too. Oh wait, Newton's second law says F = ma. The force on each rock is F = m * g, where m is mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

Wait, but if the heavy rock has more mass, wouldn't the force be greater? So F_heavy = m_heavy * g, and F_light = m_light * g. Since m_heavy > m_light, F_heavy > F_light. But both are in free fall, so their acceleration is g, which is the same. So why don't they have different accelerations?

Oh, because acceleration a = F/m. So for the heavy rock, a = (m_heavy * g) / m_heavy = g. Same for the light rock: a = (m_light * g) / m_light = g. So the mass cancels out, leading to the same acceleration.

So the question is, why doesn't the heavy rock have a greater acceleration? Because the force isn't the same, but the mass is different. So it's the ratio of force to mass that's the same, not the force or mass individually.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Air resistance is always zero in free fall. Well, the question states zero air resistance, so that's the condition, but it's not the reason the accelerations are the same. So probably not A.

Option B: Volume the same. Hmm, not necessarily. They could have different volumes but same mass if densities differ. But the question isn't about volume, so I don't think B is correct.

Option C: Force due to gravity same on each. No, because the heavy rock has more mass, so F=mg would be larger. So C is wrong.

Option D: Gravitational constant same. Well, G is a constant, but that's about the gravitational force between two objects, not the same as the acceleration here. So D might not be relevant.

Option E: Force due to gravity zero. No, in free fall, the force is acting (that's why there's acceleration), so E is wrong.

Option F: Ratio of force to mass same. Oh, that's exactly what I thought earlier. Since a = F/m, and F=mg, so a = g. So the ratio F/m is g for both, so F is same. So F is correct.

Option G: Inertia same. Inertia depends on mass. Heavy rock has more inertia, so G is wrong.

Option H: Weight same. No, weight is F=mg, which is different for each rock. So H is wrong.

Option I: Density same. Density is mass/volume. Not necessarily the same here. The rocks could have different densities, so I isn't necessarily correct.

Option J: Mass same. No, the question says one is heavy and the other light, so J is wrong.

So the correct answer must be F. Because the ratio of force to mass is the same for both rocks, which leads to the same acceleration.

The question asks why a heavy rock and a light rock in free fall (with zero air resistance) have the same acceleration. The key lies in understanding Newton's second law, \( F = ma \), and the nature of gravitational force, \( F = mg \). For both rocks, the force of gravity is proportional to their mass, and when divided by their respective masses, the acceleration \( a = g \) remains constant for both. This is because the ratio of force to mass (\( F/m \)) is the same for both rocks, leading to the same acceleration.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. While air resistance is zero, this is the condition of free fall, not the reason for the same acceleration.
- **B**: Incorrect. The volumes of the rocks are irrelevant to their acceleration in free fall.
- **C**: Incorrect. The force due to gravity is not the same for both rocks; it depends on their masses.
- **D**: Incorrect. While the gravitational constant \( G \) is the same, this is unrelated to the acceleration of the rocks in free fall.
- **E**: Incorrect. The force due to gravity is not zero in free fall; it is what causes the acceleration.
- **F**: Correct. The ratio of force to mass (\( F/m \)) is the same for both rocks, resulting in the same acceleration \( g \).
- **G**: Incorrect. Inertia depends on mass, and the rocks have different inertias.
- **H**: Incorrect. The weights (forces due to gravity) of the rocks are different because their masses are different.
- **I**: Incorrect. The densities of the rocks are not necessarily the same.
- **J**: Incorrect. The masses of the rocks are different, as stated in the question.

Thus, the correct answer is **F** because the ratio of force to mass is the same for both rocks, leading to the same acceleration.
