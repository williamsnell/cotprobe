Okay, so I have to solve this installment plan problem. Let's see, the refrigerator costs $225. The plan requires a 15% down payment, and then the rest is paid in 18 equal monthly payments with a 7% annual service charge. I need to find the down payment and the monthly payment amount.

First, the down payment is 15% of $225. That makes sense. To calculate that, I'll multiply 225 by 0.15. Let me do that: 225 * 0.15. Hmm, 15% is the same as 15 per 100. So 225 divided by 100 is 2.25, multiplied by 15 gives 33.75. So the down payment is $33.75. 

Now, the remaining balance is 225 minus 33.75. Let me subtract that. 225 - 33.75 is 191.25. So the balance due after the down payment is $191.25.

Next, there's a service charge of 7% per year. Since the payments are monthly, I think we'll need to consider the interest on the balance. But wait, how is the service charge applied? Is it 7% per annum on the remaining balance each year, or is it a simple interest applied once? 

I think it's a service charge on the balance, added to the amount to be paid over 18 months. So the total amount to pay after the down payment would be the balance plus the service charge. But wait, the service charge is 7% a year. Since the payments are over 18 months (1.5 years), does that mean we have to calculate the interest for 1.5 years? Or is the 7% applied annually, and since it's 18 months, perhaps it's 7% + 3.5% (half of 7%)?

Wait, no. Another approach: the service charge is 7% per year, so over 18 months, the total service charge would be 7% * (18/12) = 10.5%? Or maybe it's treated as simple interest over the period.

Alternatively, maybe the service charge is 7% per annum, but applied to the initial balance, added to the principal, so the total amount becomes 191.25 + (191.25 * 0.07). Let me compute that. 191.25 * 0.07 is 13.3875. So total amount to pay is 191.25 +13.3875 = 204.6375. Then, this amount is divided into 18 equal monthly payments.

Wait, but that approach might not account for the timing of payments correctly. Because when you're paying in installments, each payment reduces the principal, so the interest should be calculated on the remaining balance each period. But that's more complicated, requiring the use of an amortization schedule or the present value of an annuity formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the simple interest approach, where the interest is calculated on the initial balance, and then the total is divided by the number of payments.

So, let's try that. The balance after down payment is 191.25. The service charge is 7% per year. The payments are monthly, over 18 months, which is 1.5 years. So the total interest would be 191.25 * 0.07 * 1.5 = let's calculate that.

191.25 * 0.07 is 13.3875. Multiply by 1.5: 13.3875 * 1.5 = 20.08125. So total interest is about $20.08. Adding that to the principal: 191.25 +20.08 = 211.33. Then, divide by 18 months: 211.33 /18 ≈ 11.74 per month.

Wait, but that would mean the monthly payment is approximately $11.74. So combining this with the down payment of $33.75, let's look at the options.

Looking at the options, option B is $33.75 down and $11.74 monthly. That seems to match. But wait, let me double-check because I might have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the service charge is applied as 7% annually on the remaining balance. So the way to calculate this is using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula. The formula for the monthly payment (PMT) is:

PMT = (P * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)

But wait, in this case, the rate per period would be the annual rate divided by 12. So r = 7% /12 = 0.0058333 per month. The number of periods n is 18.

But the principal P here is the balance after down payment plus the interest? Or is it just the balance, and the service charge is the interest. Wait, perhaps the service charge is treated as the interest rate. So the balance due is $191.25, and the service charge is 7% per year. So the monthly interest rate is 7% /12 = approx 0.0058333.

So using the present value formula, the present value PV is the balance after down payment, which is 191.25. The payment PMT each month for 18 months would be calculated as:

PMT = PV * r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n )

Plugging in the numbers:

r = 0.07/12 ≈0.0058333

n=18

So PMT = 191.25 * 0.0058333 / (1 - (1 +0.0058333)^-18 )

Let me compute the denominator first. (1.0058333)^-18. Let me compute (1.0058333)^18 first, then take reciprocal and subtract from 1.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach. Let me compute (1.0058333)^18.

Using a calculator, 1.0058333^18 ≈ 1.094196. So 1/(1.0058333)^18 ≈ 1/1.094196 ≈ 0.9143.

So denominator is 1 - 0.9143 = 0.0857.

So PMT = 191.25 * 0.0058333 / 0.0857.

Calculate numerator: 191.25 * 0.0058333 ≈ 1.116666.

So 1.116666 / 0.0857 ≈ approx 13.03 per month.

Wait, that's different from the earlier $11.74. So which approach is correct?

Hmm, the problem states that the balance due, along with a 7% annual service charge, is to be paid in 18 equal monthly payments. So perhaps the service charge is 7% of the balance, added once, and then the total is divided by 18.

So in that case, the total amount would be 191.25 + (191.25 *0.07) = 191.25 + 13.3875 = 204.6375. Then, 204.6375 /18 = approx 11.3693, which is about $11.37 per month.

But wait, earlier when I calculated the 1.5 years of interest, I got around $20 added, leading to a payment of $11.74. Wait, maybe the service charge is 7% per annum, regardless of the time, so it's just added once, not compounded over the 18 months.

In that case, the total amount to pay is 191.25 + (191.25 * 0.07) = 204.6375. Then, divided by 18, that's approximately 11.369, which is about $11.37 per month.

Looking back at the options, option B is $33.75 down and $11.74 per month. That's close to the $11.37 I just calculated, but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the interest as 7% per year on the initial balance, but spread over 18 months, so 1.5 years, which would mean 10.5% interest (7% * 1.5). So 191.25 * 0.105 = 20.08125. Adding that to 191.25 gives 211.33125. Divide by 18: 211.33125 /18 ≈ 11.74, which matches option B's monthly payment.

So that's why the first approach gave $11.74. So perhaps the service charge is 7% per annum on the balance, but applied over the 18 months, so 1.5 times 7% = 10.5% interest. So the total interest is 10.5% of 191.25, which is 20.08. Adding to 191.25 gives 211.33. Divided by 18 payments: 211.33 /18 ≈ 11.74, which is what option B says.

So the down payment is $33.75, which matches option B. So the correct answer should be option B: $33.75 and $11.74.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the down payment, which is 15% of the refrigerator's price. The refrigerator costs $225, so the down payment is:

\[
\text{Down Payment} = 0.15 \times 225 = 33.75
\]

The remaining balance after the down payment is:

\[
\text{Balance} = 225 - 33.75 = 191.25
\]

Next, the problem specifies a 7% annual service charge on the balance. Since the payments are spread over 18 months (1.5 years), the total service charge is calculated as:

\[
\text{Service Charge} = 191.25 \times (0.07 \times 1.5) = 191.25 \times 0.105 = 20.08125
\]

The total amount to be paid, including the service charge, is:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = 191.25 + 20.08125 = 211.33125
\]

This total amount is divided into 18 equal monthly payments:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{211.33125}{18} \approx 11.74
\]

Thus, the down payment is $33.75, and the monthly payment is approximately $11.74. Comparing these values to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B: $33.75 and $11.74**

B
