Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinematics and dynamics questions. But let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about a mass being dropped in a medium that offers some resistance. The mass is 0.25 kg, and the resistance is given as 0.2 times the absolute value of the velocity, which I think is 0.2|v|. The mass is dropped from a height of 30 meters, and we need to find its velocity when it hits the ground. The options are from A to J, with various m/s values.

Hmm. So, the problem involves motion under gravity with air resistance. I remember that when an object falls through a fluid (like air or water), there's a force opposing the motion called drag. The drag force here is proportional to the velocity, so it's a linear drag. I think this is a case where we can model the motion with differential equations.

Wait, Newton's second law applies here. The net force on the mass is equal to mass times acceleration. So, the forces acting are gravity pulling down and drag opposing the motion. Since the mass is moving downward, the drag force is upward.

So, the forces: the gravitational force is mg, where m is 0.25 kg and g is 9.8 m/s². The drag force is 0.2v, and since it's opposite to the direction of motion, it subtracts from the gravitational force.

So, the net force F_net would be mg - 0.2v. Wait, no, wait. If upward is positive, then the gravitational force is downward, so it's negative. Or maybe I should take downward as positive, which might make more sense in this context.

Let me think: if I take downward as positive, then the gravitational force is positive, and the drag force is negative because it's acting upward. So F_net = mg - 0.2v.

Then, by Newton's second law, F_net = m*a. But a is dv/dt, the derivative of velocity with respect to time. So:

m*(dv/dt) = mg - 0.2v.

Let me rearrange this equation. Let's write it as:

dv/dt = g - (0.2/m)v.

Wait, because m is 0.25 kg. So 0.2 divided by 0.25 is 0.8. So the equation becomes:

dv/dt = g - 0.8v.

This is a first-order linear differential equation. I've heard about solving these using integrating factors or separation of variables. Let me try separation of variables.

So, let's write the equation as:

dv/(g - 0.8v) = dt.

Integrate both sides. But wait, the left side integral is with respect to v, and the right side is with respect to t.

Hmm, the integral of 1/(g - 0.8v) dv. Let me make a substitution. Let u = g - 0.8v. Then du/dv = -0.8, so dv = -du/(0.8).

Wait, but wait, when I do substitution, the integral becomes ∫ (1/u) * (-du/0.8) ) = ∫ (-1/(0.8 u)) du. Which is -(1/0.8) ln|u| + C.

Alternatively, maybe I should factor out the constants. Let's see:

∫ [1/(g - 0.8v)] dv = ∫ dt.

Let me factor out the 0.8 from the denominator:

1/(0.8) ∫ [1/( (g/0.8) - v ) ] dv = ∫ dt.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to just proceed by solving the differential equation. Let me write the equation as:

dv/dt + (0.8)v = g.

This is a linear DE of the form dv/dt + P(t) v = Q(t). Here, P(t) is 0.8, and Q(t) is g, which are constants. So the integrating factor is e^{∫P dt} = e^{0.8t}.

Multiply both sides by the integrating factor:

e^{0.8t} dv/dt + 0.8 e^{0.8t} v = g e^{0.8t}.

The left side is the derivative of (v e^{0.8t}) with respect to t. So:

d/dt (v e^{0.8t}) = g e^{0.8t}.

Integrate both sides with respect to t:

v e^{0.8t} = ∫ g e^{0.8t} dt + C.

The integral of g e^{0.8t} is (g/0.8) e^{0.8t} + C. So:

v e^{0.8t} = (g/0.8) e^{0.8t} + C.

Divide both sides by e^{0.8t}:

v(t) = (g/0.8) + C e^{-0.8t}.

Now apply the initial condition. At t=0, the mass is dropped from rest, so v(0) = 0.

Plugging in t=0:

0 = (g/0.8) + C e^0 => 0 = (g/0.8) + C => C = -g/0.8.

So the velocity as a function of time is:

v(t) = (g/0.8) (1 - e^{ -0.8t }).

Wait, because it's (g/0.8) + C e^{-0.8t} and C is -g/0.8. So:

v(t) = (g/0.8) [1 - e^{-0.8t} ].

Now, we need to find the velocity when the mass hits the ground. The height is 30 meters, so we need to find the time it takes to fall 30 meters, then plug that time into the velocity equation.

Wait, but maybe there's another approach. Alternatively, since the question gives the height, perhaps it's easier to model the position as a function of time and find the time when the position is 30 meters.

But that might involve solving another differential equation. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the terminal velocity and see if the object reaches it before hitting the ground.

Wait, the terminal velocity is the maximum velocity the object reaches when the net force is zero. That would be when dv/dt = 0, so:

0 = g - 0.8 v_t => v_t = g / 0.8.

Given that g is approximately 9.8 m/s², v_t would be 9.8 / 0.8 = 12.25 m/s.

So the terminal velocity is 12.25 m/s. Now, the question is whether the object reaches this velocity before hitting the ground. Because if the time it takes to reach 30 m is less than the time to reach terminal velocity, then the final velocity will be less than 12.25 m/s.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the time it takes to fall 30 meters under this motion.

Wait, the position as a function of time can be found by integrating the velocity function.

We have v(t) = (g/0.8)(1 - e^{-0.8t}).

So, the position y(t) is the integral of v(t) dt, plus the initial position (which is 0, since it starts at y=0? Wait, no, the initial position is height 30 m, but wait, actually, if we take y as the distance fallen, then the initial position is 0, and the final is 30 m.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the coordinate system so that downward is positive. So y(t) is the distance fallen from the starting point.

So, starting from rest, the initial position y(0)=0. Then, the position as a function of time is the integral of v(t) dt from 0 to t.

v(t) = (g/0.8)(1 - e^{-0.8t}).

So, y(t) = ∫0^t v(t') dt' = (g/0.8) ∫0^t [1 - e^{-0.8 t'} ] dt'.

Let's compute that integral. The integral of 1 dt' is t. The integral of e^{-0.8 t'} dt' is (-1/0.8) e^{-0.8 t'}.

So,

y(t) = (g/0.8) [ t + (1/0.8) e^{-0.8 t} - (1/0.8) e^{0} ].

Simplify:

y(t) = (g/0.8) [ t + (1/0.8)(e^{-0.8 t} - 1) ].

Which can be written as:

y(t) = (g/0.8) t + (g/(0.8)^2) (e^{-0.8 t} - 1).

We need to find the time t when y(t) = 30 m.

So, set y(t) = 30:

30 = (g/0.8) t + (g/(0.64)) (e^{-0.8 t} - 1).

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated to solve for t. Maybe I can plug in g=9.8 m/s² and compute numerically.

Let me compute the coefficients.

g = 9.8 m/s².

So, (g/0.8) = 9.8 / 0.8 = 12.25 s^-1? Wait, no, units would be m/s² divided by 1/s, so m/s.

Wait, 9.8 divided by 0.8 is 12.25, so 12.25 m/s.

Then, g/(0.8)^2 = 9.8 / (0.64) ≈ 15.3125 m.

Wait, because 0.64 is 0.8 squared.

So substituting these into the equation:

30 = 12.25 t + 15.3125 (e^{-0.8 t} - 1).

Let me compute each term.

First, expand the equation:

30 = 12.25 t + 15.3125 e^{-0.8 t} - 15.3125.

Bring the constants together:

30 + 15.3125 = 12.25 t + 15.3125 e^{-0.8 t}.

So, 45.3125 = 12.25 t + 15.3125 e^{-0.8 t}.

Hmm, this equation needs to be solved for t. I don't think it's easily solvable algebraically, so perhaps I can use an iterative approach or some approximation.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the approximation that at the time of impact, the velocity is close to the terminal velocity. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think: the terminal velocity is 12.25 m/s. The options given include 12.75 (I) and 13.45 (D), but also lower values. So maybe the velocity at impact is less than terminal, meaning the object hasn't reached terminal velocity yet.

Wait, but let me approximate. Let me plug in t such that the position is 30 m.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the problem using energy methods, but given that drag is proportional to velocity, that might not simplify things much.

Wait, maybe use the equation for velocity and integrate numerically or find an approximate solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use some substitution for t to make this solvable.

Wait, given that this is a multiple-choice question, maybe I can plug in the given options into the velocity equation and see which one, when used to compute the position, gives 30 meters.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the time it takes to reach each given velocity and see which one corresponds to a 30 m drop.

Alternatively, maybe I can take a guess that the velocity is less than terminal velocity, so perhaps around 10 m/s or so.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Let me consider the equation of motion again.

The velocity equation is v(t) = (g/0.8)(1 - e^{-0.8t}).

The terminal velocity is 12.25 m/s, as I calculated earlier.

So, perhaps I can compute the time t when the velocity is, say, 12 m/s, and see whether y(t) at that time is close to 30 m.

Wait, let's try with option I: 12.75 m/s.

So, if v = 12.75 m/s, which is higher than terminal velocity? Wait, no, terminal velocity is 12.25, so 12.75 is higher, which can't be, because terminal velocity is the maximum. So option I is 12.75, which is higher than 12.25, so that's not possible. So I can eliminate that option.

Wait, no, perhaps I miscalculated. Wait, the terminal velocity is (g)/(b/m), where b is the drag coefficient. Wait, in this problem, the drag force is 0.2v, so F_drag = 0.2v. So, the terminal velocity is when mg = 0.2v_t, so v_t = (mg)/0.2.

Wait, wait a second, I think I made a mistake earlier in calculating the terminal velocity. Let me redo that.

Terminal velocity is when the acceleration is zero, so the net force is zero.

So, mg - 0.2 v_t = 0 => v_t = (mg)/0.2.

m is 0.25 kg, so 0.25 * 9.8 = 2.45 N. So 2.45 N is mg. Then, 0.2 is the drag coefficient, so v_t = 2.45 / 0.2 = 12.25 m/s as I had before. So that's correct.

So any velocity higher than 12.25 m/s is impossible, so option I (12.75) is invalid. So I can eliminate that.

Now, the options are A (15.35), B (16.10), C (8.50), D (13.45), E (7.92), F (9.63), G (10), H (11.58), J (14.20).

Wait, but wait, the terminal velocity is 12.25 m/s, so the maximum possible velocity is that. So any option above that is impossible, so A, B, D, J are all higher than 12.25. So they can't be correct.

So that leaves us with options C, E, F, G, H.

So the correct answer must be among C, E, F, G, H.

Now, let's compute the time when the velocity reaches some of these values and check if the position is 30 m.

Wait, let's pick option H: 11.58 m/s.

So, v = 11.58 m/s.

Using the velocity equation:

v(t) = (12.25)(1 - e^{-0.8 t}).

So, 11.58 = 12.25 (1 - e^{-0.8 t}).

Let me solve for t.

11.58 / 12.25 = 1 - e^{-0.8 t}.

11.58 ÷ 12.25 ≈ 0.945.

So 0.945 = 1 - e^{-0.8 t} => e^{-0.8 t} = 1 - 0.945 = 0.055.

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

-0.8 t = ln(0.055) ≈ -2.988.

So, t ≈ (-2.988)/(-0.8) ≈ 3.735 seconds.

Now, compute the position y(t) at t ≈3.735 s.

y(t) = (g / 0.8) t + (g / (0.8)^2)(e^{-0.8 t} - 1).

Plugging in the numbers:

g = 9.8 m/s².

g/0.8 = 12.25 m/s.

g/(0.8)^2 = 9.8 / 0.64 ≈ 15.3125 m.

So,

y = 12.25 * 3.735 + 15.3125 * (e^{-0.8 * 3.735} - 1).

Compute each part:

12.25 * 3.735 ≈ 12.25 * 3.735. Let me compute that.

12 * 3.735 = 44.82, 0.25 * 3.735 = ~0.93375. So total ≈45.75375 meters.

Wait, that can't be right because the drop is only 30 meters. So this suggests that at t≈3.735 s, the position is already beyond 30 meters. So perhaps 11.58 m/s is too high, meaning that the correct velocity is lower than that, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 12.25 * 3.735.

12.25 * 3 = 36.75.

12.25 * 0.735 = Let's compute 12.25 * 0.7 = 8.575, 12.25 * 0.035 = 0.42875. So 8.575 + 0.42875 = 9.00375.

So total 36.75 + 9.00375 = 45.75375 meters.

That's way beyond 30 meters. So perhaps the time when velocity is 11.58 m/s is when y(t) is 45.75 m, which is more than the 30 m drop. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Since the position is 30 meters, the velocity must be less than terminal velocity, but perhaps I should find the time when y(t)=30 and then compute v(t) at that time.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an iterative approach to solve for t in the equation:

30 = 12.25 t + 15.3125 (e^{-0.8 t} - 1).

We can write this as:

30 = 12.25 t + 15.3125 e^{-0.8 t} - 15.3125.

So, 30 + 15.3125 = 12.25 t + 15.3125 e^{-0.8 t}.

Which is 45.3125 = 12.25 t + 15.3125 e^{-0.8 t}.

Let me denote this as equation (1).

This is a transcendental equation and can't
