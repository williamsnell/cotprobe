Alright, I'm trying to figure out which group of Americans has the lowest rate of alcohol abuse. The options are from A to J, each representing different ethnic or cultural groups. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that alcohol abuse rates can vary significantly among different demographic groups. Factors like cultural attitudes towards alcohol, societal norms, and even genetic predispositions might play a role.

I recall that Native Americans, option I, have historically had high rates of alcohol abuse. This is often linked to historical trauma and socioeconomic factors. So I think they might have a higher rate, not the lowest.

Looking at European-Americans, option C, and White Americans, option G, they might have moderate rates. I'm not entirely sure if they're the lowest, though. Sometimes studies show that certain groups have lower rates due to cultural reasons.

Hispanic-Americans, option D, might have varying rates depending on their specific background. I think some studies suggest that Hispanic groups might have lower alcohol abuse rates compared to some others, but I'm not certain if they're the lowest.

Asian-Americans, option J, come to mind. I remember reading that some Asian cultures have lower rates of alcohol abuse. Maybe because of cultural norms or perhaps due to genetic factors, like the flushing reaction some people of East Asian descent experience when drinking alcohol, which could deter heavy drinking. This makes me think that Asian-Americans might have lower rates.

Jewish-Americans, option H, might also have lower rates. I think there's some data indicating that Jewish communities have lower alcohol abuse rates, possibly due to religious and cultural practices that emphasize moderate drinking or abstaining.

Middle Eastern-Americans, option B, might have lower rates as well, considering that many Middle Eastern countries have cultural or religious prohibitions against alcohol consumption. So perhaps this group has lower alcohol abuse.

Pacific Islander-Americans, option A, I'm less sure about. I don't recall specific data, but I think their rates might be somewhere in the middle.

Mixed Race-Americans, option E, probably vary widely since they come from diverse backgrounds, so it's hard to generalize.

African-Americans, option F, I think have rates that are lower than some groups but not the lowest. Some studies suggest lower alcohol dependence rates compared to White Americans.

Putting this all together, I think the groups with the lowest rates might be Asian-Americans, Jewish-Americans, and Middle Eastern-Americans. But which one is the lowest?

I think I've read that Asian-Americans tend to have lower alcohol abuse rates compared to other groups. But I'm also considering that Middle Eastern-Americans might have even lower rates due to stricter cultural norms against alcohol. However, I'm not entirely sure about the exact rankings.

Wait, another angle: some sources indicate that Jewish-Americans have lower rates of alcohol abuse, possibly due to cultural factors. But I'm not certain if they're lower than Asian-Americans.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the Asian-Americans. I think the flushing response in many Asians could lead to lower consumption, thus lower abuse rates.

So, considering all this, I'm leaning towards either J (Asian-American) or B (Middle Eastern-American) as having the lowest rates. But based on what I remember, Asian-Americans are often cited as having lower alcohol abuse rates compared to other groups.

Therefore, the correct answer might be J: Asian-American.

The question asks which group of Americans has the lowest rate of alcohol abuse. To determine this, I considered various factors such as cultural attitudes, societal norms, and genetic predispositions that influence alcohol consumption patterns.

- **Native-Americans (I)**: Historically high rates due to historical trauma and socioeconomic factors.
- **European-Americans (C) and White Americans (G)**: Likely moderate rates, not the lowest.
- **Hispanic-Americans (D)**: Varying rates, possibly lower than some groups but not necessarily the lowest.
- **Asian-Americans (J)**: Often cited as having lower rates, possibly due to cultural norms and genetic factors like the flushing reaction.
- **Jewish-Americans (H)**: Lower rates possibly due to religious and cultural practices emphasizing moderation.
- **Middle Eastern-Americans (B)**: Likely lower rates due to cultural or religious prohibitions against alcohol.
- **Pacific Islander-Americans (A)**: Rates likely in the middle.
- **Mixed Race-Americans (E)**: Varying rates due to diverse backgrounds.
- **African-Americans (F)**: Lower rates than some groups but not the lowest.

After evaluating, **Asian-Americans (J)** are often noted for having lower alcohol abuse rates, likely due to cultural and genetic factors. While Middle Eastern-Americans (B) and Jewish-Americans (H) also have lower rates, the evidence suggests Asian-Americans may have the lowest.
