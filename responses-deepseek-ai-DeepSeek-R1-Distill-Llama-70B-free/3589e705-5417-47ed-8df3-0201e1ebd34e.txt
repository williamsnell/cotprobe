Okay, so I have this problem about solving Poisson's equation for a charged sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says the sphere has a radius a and a constant charge density rho inside. Outside, rho is zero. I need to find the potential phi everywhere. The options are A through D, each giving expressions for phi inside (phi_i) and outside (phi_0) as functions of r.

First, I remember that Poisson's equation is ∇²φ = -ρ/ε₀. Oh wait, but wait, in regions where there's no charge (like outside the sphere), ρ is zero, so Poisson's equation becomes Laplace's equation: ∇²φ = 0.

So for the outside region (r > a), since it's symmetric, the potential should only depend on r. The general solution to Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates for this case is phi(r) = A/r + B. But since the potential goes to zero at infinity (assuming it's the case here), the constant term B must be zero. So phi_0(r) = A/r. But what's A?

I think A is related to the total charge of the sphere. The total charge Q can be found by integrating the charge density over the volume of the sphere. The charge density is rho, which is constant inside. So Q = rho * (4/3)πa³.

Now, from Gauss's Law, the electric field outside the sphere should be the same as that of a point charge Q. So E(r) = Q/(4πε₀r²) in the radial direction. And since E is the negative gradient of phi, E = -dφ/dr. So let's relate this.

For the outside solution:
phi_0(r) = A/r
E = -d(phi_0)/dr = A/r²

But from Gauss's law, E = Q/(4πε₀ r²). So equating the two expressions for E:
A/r² = Q/(4πε₀ r²)
So A = Q/(4πε₀)

Substituting Q = rho*(4/3)πa³:
A = (rho*(4/3)πa³) / (4πε₀)
Simplify that: the 4π cancels out, so A = (rho a³)/(3 ε₀)
So phi_0(r) = (rho a³)/(3 ε₀ r)

Wait, looking at the options, option B has phi_0 as (rho a^3)/(3 ε₀ r). So that's matching.

Now for the inside region (r < a), we have to solve Poisson's equation with rho being constant. So ∇²φ_i = -rho/ε₀.

In spherical coordinates, the solution for phi_i(r) inside a sphere with constant charge density is a quadratic function. I think the general solution inside is phi_i(r) = B + C r². Because the Laplacian of a quadratic function in r would be a constant.

Wait, let's compute the Laplacian of phi_i. For a function that depends only on r, the Laplacian in spherical coordinates is (1/r²)(d/dr)(r² dφ/dr). So let's compute that.

Let’s say phi_i(r) = Ar² + B. Then dφ/dr = 2Ar. Then r² dφ/dr = 2A r³. Then d/dr of that is 6A r². So the Laplacian is (1/r²)(6A r²) )= 6A.

So according to Poisson's equation, 6A = -rho/(epsilon_0). So A = -rho/(6 epsilon_0).

So phi_i(r) = (-rho/(6 epsilon_0)) r² + B.

Now we need to find B using boundary conditions. At r = a, the potential phi_i(a) must match phi_0(a), and the electric field must also be continuous there.

Wait, the electric field is the negative gradient. So for phi_i, E_i = -d phi_i/dr = - [ 2*(-rho/(6 eps0)) r ] evaluated at r=a. So E_i(a) = (rho/(3 eps0)) a.

For phi_0, E_0 = (rho a^3)/(3 eps0 r^2). At r=a, E_0(a) = (rho a^3)/(3 eps0 a²) )= rho a/(3 eps0). So E_i and E_0 match at r=a, which is consistent.

Now, the potential at r=a must be the same for both phi_i and phi_0. So phi_i(a) = phi_0(a).

phi_0(a) = (rho a^3)/(3 eps0 a) )= rho a²/(3 eps0).

phi_i(a) = (-rho/(6 eps0)) a² + B.

Setting equal:
rho a²/(3 eps0) = (-rho a²)/(6 eps0) + B
Multiply both sides by 6 eps0 to eliminate denominators:
2 rho a² = - rho a² + 6 eps0 B
Bring terms together:
2 rho a² + rho a² = 6 eps0 B
3 rho a² = 6 eps0 B
B = (3 rho a²) / (6 eps0) ) = rho a²/(2 eps0)

So phi_i(r) = (-rho/(6 eps0)) r² + (rho a²)/(2 eps0)

Simplify this expression:
= (rho/(6 eps0)) ( -r² + 3 a² )
= [ rho (3a² - r²) ] / (6 eps0 )

Which can be written as [ rho (3a² - r²) ] / (6 eps0)

Looking back at the options, option B says phi_i(r) = [ rho/(6 eps0) ] (3a² - r² ), which matches. And phi_0(r) is [ rho a^3 ]/(3 eps0 r), which also matches option B.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To solve Poisson's equation for a sphere of radius \(a\) with constant charge density \(\rho\) inside (\(r \leq a\)) and \(\rho = 0\) outside (\(r > a\)), we proceed as follows:

### Outside Region (\(r > a\)):
1. **Gauss's Law**: The electric field outside the sphere is equivalent to that of a point charge \(Q\), where \(Q = \rho \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi a^3\). Thus, \(E(r) = \frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r^2}\).
2. **Potential**: The potential satisfies \(\phi_0(r) = \frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r}\). Substituting \(Q = \rho \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi a^3\), we get:
   \[
   \phi_0(r) = \frac{\rho a^3}{3 \epsilon_0 r}.
   \]

### Inside Region (\(r \leq a\)):
1. **Poisson's Equation**: Inside the sphere, \(\nabla^2 \phi_i = -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}\). The general solution for \(\phi_i(r)\) in spherical symmetry is a quadratic function: \(\phi_i(r) = A r^2 + B\).
2. **Laplacian**: The Laplacian of \(\phi_i(r)\) is \(\nabla^2 \phi_i = 6A\). From Poisson's equation, \(6A = -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}\), so \(A = -\frac{\rho}{6 \epsilon_0}\).
3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - At \(r = a\), \(\phi_i(a) = \phi_0(a)\): 
     \[
     \phi_i(a) = -\frac{\rho}{6 \epsilon_0} a^2 + B, \quad \phi_0(a) = \frac{\rho a^2}{3 \epsilon_0}.
     \]
     Equating these gives:
     \[
     B = \frac{\rho a^2}{2 \epsilon_0}.
     \]
   - The electric field is continuous at \(r = a\), which is already satisfied by the derived expressions.
4. **Final Expression**: Substituting \(A\) and \(B\), the potential inside is:
   \[
   \phi_i(r) = \frac{\rho}{6 \epsilon_0} \left(3a^2 - r^2\right).
   \]

### Matching with Options:
- For \(r > a\), \(\phi_0(r) = \frac{\rho a^3}{3 \epsilon_0 r}\).
- For \(r \leq a\), \(\phi_i(r) = \frac{\rho}{6 \epsilon_0} \left(3a^2 - r^2\right)\).

These match the expressions in **Option B**.
