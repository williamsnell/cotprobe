Okay, I need to calculate the relative intensities of the secondary maxima in a single-slit Fraunhofer diffraction pattern. Hmm, I remember that in single-slit diffraction, the primary maxima are much more intense than the secondary maxima. The secondary maxima occur between the primary maxima, which are the dark fringes.

Wait, the formula for the intensity in single-slit diffraction is given by I = I0 * (sin(πa sinθ / λ))² / (πa sinθ / λ)². Oh wait, no, that's the general form. But for the secondary maxima, the intensity isn't zero, but it's much less than the principal maxima.

I think the secondary maxima occur approximately midway between the zeros of the diffraction pattern. The first secondary maximum is the first peak after the central maximum. The relative intensity of these secondary maxima can be found by evaluating the function at those points.

Wait, let me think. The positions of the secondary maxima can be found by taking the derivative of the intensity function and setting it to zero. So the intensity is I = I0 * [sin(x)]² / x², where x = (π a sinθ)/λ.

For secondary maxima, we're looking for the maxima in between the zeros of sin(x), which occur at x = nπ, where n is an integer. So the first secondary maximum would be between x=π and x=2π. The maxima occur where the derivative of [sin(x)/x]^2 is zero. Let me compute the derivative.

Let me denote y = sin(x)/x. Then I = y², so dI/dx = 2y dy/dx. Setting this to zero gives dy/dx = 0. So dy/dx = [x cos(x) - sin(x)] / x² = 0. So the numerator must be zero: x cos(x) - sin(x) = 0 → x = tan(x).

Wait, that's a transcendental equation. So for each secondary maximum, the x value satisfies x = tan(x), but only for certain intervals. For the first secondary maximum, x is between π and 2π. Let me approximate this.

Wait, I think the approximate positions can be found. For the first secondary maximum, after the central peak: the first zero is at x=π. The next zero is at 2π. So the first secondary maximum is around x≈3π/2, but that's not exactly correct because the function isn't symmetric in that way. Alternatively, I think the approximate x for the first secondary maximum is at x ≈ 1.4308 π, but wait, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no, wait. The first secondary maximum occurs at x ≈ 1.4308 π, which is less than 1.5 π. Because the solution to x = tan(x) in the interval π < x < 2π is approximately x ≈ 4.4934, but wait, no, that's for a different condition. Maybe I'm getting confused with other equations.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The equation is x = tan(x). For the first solution after x=π, we can approximate it numerically. Let's see, at x= π + π/4 = 5π/4 ≈ 3.927. Let me compute tan(5π/4) = 1, but 5π/4 is about 3.927. So x=5π/4 is 3.927. At that point, x=3.927, tan(x)=1. So 3.927 vs 1? That's not matching x=tan(x). So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the first solution after π is around x ≈ 4.493 radians. Oh wait, 4.493 is about 1.43π (since 1.43 *3.14≈4.49). So 4.493 is about 1.43π. So for the first secondary maximum, x ≈ 4.493, which is in the interval between π and 2π.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me recall: The first zero is at x=π, the next at x=2π. The first secondary maximum is the first local maximum after the central peak. So for the first secondary maximum, the x is approximately 1.4308 π? Or perhaps I'm mixing it up with another problem. Maybe it's better to think in terms of approximate values.

Alternatively, I remember that the maxima of the secondary peaks in single-slit diffraction can be approximated by using the intensity formula and plugging in the x values where the derivative is zero.

But perhaps an alternative approach is better. The relative intensity of the secondary maxima can be calculated using the formula for the intensity at these points.

Wait, another approach: The primary maximum is at x=0 (θ=0), and its intensity is I0. For the secondary maxima, the first one is the most intense, then they decrease in intensity.

I think the first secondary maximum occurs at x ≈ 1.4308 π, the second at x≈ 2.4590 π, the third at x≈3.4706 π, etc. The corresponding intensity is I/I0 = [1/(x^2)] [sin(x)]^2.

Wait, no, because I = [sin(x)/x]^2. So for each x value, compute [sin(x)/x]^2.

So for the first secondary maximum, x ≈ 1.4308 π. Let's compute sin(x) at that point.

x = 1.4308 * π ≈ 4.493 radians.

sin(4.493) → let's compute that. 4.493 radians is about 257 degrees (since π is 180, 4.493-π=1.35, which is 77.7 degrees beyond 180. So 180 +77.7= 257.7 degrees. Sin(257.7) is sin(180+77.7) = -sin(77.7) ≈ -0.9744. So |sin(x)| ≈ 0.9744.

So sin(x) ≈ -0.9744, but since we square it, it's (0.9744)^2 ≈ 0.9494.

Then [sin(x)/x]^2 = [0.9744/(4.493)]². Let's compute 0.9744/4.493 ≈ 0.217. Squared is ~0.047. So I/I0 ≈ 0.047.

Wait, but wait. Let me be precise. x=1.4308*π ≈ 4.4934. sin(4.4934)= sin(π + 1.3224)= -sin(1.3224). 1.3224 radians is about 75.7 degrees. So sin(1.3224)= approx 0.9703. So sin(4.4934)= -0.9703. So [sin(x)]² = (0.9703)^2 ≈ 0.9415.

Then [sin(x)/x]^2 = (0.9703 /4.4934 )^2.

0.9703 /4.4934 ≈ 0.216.

0.216 squared is approx 0.0466.

So the first secondary maximum has a relative intensity of approximately 0.0466, which is about 0.047 or 4.7% of the central maximum.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly 0.047, but let's look. The options are A:0.035, B:0.030, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something because the options don't seem to include 0.047 as the first value.

Wait, maybe the approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the secondary maxima's intensity relative to each other, not relative to the central maximum. Wait, the question says "relative intensities of the secondary maxima"—so each secondary maximum's intensity relative to the central maximum.

Wait, the central maximum has I0, so the first secondary is about 0.047 I0, the second about (0.014) I0, and the third about (0.007) I0, perhaps. Let me check the second and third maxima.

Let's compute for the second secondary maximum. The x value is approximately 2.4590 * π. Let me compute that: 2.4590 * π ≈7.727 radians.

sin(7.727) → let's convert 7.727 radians to degrees. 7.727 * (180/π) ≈ 7.727 *57.3 ≈ 442.7 degrees. Subtract 360 (full circle) → 82.7 degrees. So sin(7.727) = sin(442.7) = sin(82.7) ≈ 0.9914.

So [sin(x)]² = (0.9914)^2 ≈ 0.9828.

x is 7.727, so [0.9914 /7.727 ]² → 0.9914/7.727 ≈ 0.1284. Squared is ~0.0165.

So the second secondary maximum is about 0.0165 I0.

Similarly, the third secondary maximum occurs at x ≈ 3.4706 π ≈10.89 radians.

sin(10.89) → let's compute 10.89 radians in degrees: 10.89 * (180/π) ≈625 degrees. Subtract 360 → 265 degrees. So sin(265) = sin(180+85) = -sin(85) ≈ -0.9962. So |sin(x)| is 0.9962.

So [sin(x)/x]^2 = (0.9962/10.89)^2 → 0.9962/10.89 ≈0.0916. Squared is ~0.0084.

So the third secondary maximum is about 0.0084 I0.

So the relative intensities of the first three secondary maxima are approximately 0.047, 0.0165, 0.0084.

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches these.

Option A: 0.035, 0.014, 0.0070.

Option E: 0.040, 0.015, 0.0075.

Hmm, my calculated values are 0.047, 0.0165, 0.0084.

Wait, none of the options exactly match, but perhaps my approximated x values are a bit off. Because perhaps the x values are slightly different, leading to different intensities.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses approximate values for the secondary maxima positions, such as using the midpoint between zeros.

Wait, another approach: For the nth secondary maximum, the approximate x value can be approximated as x ≈ (n + 1/2) π. For example, the first secondary maximum is between π and 2π, so x ≈ (3/2) π = 4.712 radians.

Wait, let me test that. For n=1, x≈ (1.5) π=4.712.

Then sin(x) at x=4.712. Let's compute 4.712 radians is about 270 degrees. Wait, wait, 4.712 is 3π/2, which is 4.712 radians. Sin(3π/2) is -1. So [sin(x)]²=1.

Then [sin(x)/x]^2 = [ (-1)/4.712 ]^2 = 1/(22.18) ≈0.045.

Hmm, that's about 0.045. So the first secondary maximum is about 0.045 I0.

The second secondary maximum would be at x ≈ (5/2) π = 7.854. Sin(7.854) is sin( (5/2) π )= sin(π/2)=1, but 5/2 π is 2.5 π, which is 450 degrees, which is same as 90 degrees. So sin(7.854)=1.

Thus, [sin(x)/x]^2 = (1/7.854)^2 ≈ (0.1274)^2≈0.0162.

Third secondary maximum: x≈ (7/2) π=11.0. Sin(11.0) → 11 radians is about 630 degrees → 630-360=270 degrees. Sin(270)= -1.

[sin(x)/x]^2 = (1/11.0)^2≈0.00826.

So the relative intensities would be approximately 0.045, 0.0162, 0.00826.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.045, 0.016, 0.0083. That's very close.

Wait, so option C is 0.045, 0.016, 0.0083.

Yes, that's the closest to these approximate values.

Wait, but wait, I thought the first secondary maximum was at x≈4.493, not 4.712. So perhaps using the exact x values would give a slightly different intensity. But perhaps the question expects approximate values based on the midpoints between zeros, which is x=(n+1/2)π.

So in that case, the first secondary maximum is 0.045, second 0.016, third 0.0083. Which matches option C.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To calculate the relative intensities of the secondary maxima in the single-slit Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, we use the intensity formula:

\[
I = I_0 \left( \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \right)^2, \quad \text{where } x = \frac{\pi a \sin\theta}{\lambda}.
\]

The secondary maxima occur between the zeros of the diffraction pattern, which are located at \(x = n\pi\) for \(n = 1, 2, 3, \dots\). The positions of the secondary maxima are approximate solutions to the equation \(x = \tan(x)\), but for simplicity, they can be approximated as \(x \approx (n + 1/2)\pi\), where \(n = 1, 2, 3, \dots\).

### First Secondary Maximum
For the first secondary maximum (\(n = 1\)), \(x \approx \frac{3\pi}{2} \approx 4.712\). At this point:
\[
\sin(x) = \sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) = -1, \quad \left(\frac{\sin(x)}{x}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{-1}{4.712}\right)^2 \approx 0.045.
\]

### Second Secondary Maximum
For the second secondary maximum (\(n = 2\)), \(x \approx \frac{5\pi}{2} \approx 7.854\). At this point:
\[
\sin(x) = \sin\left(\frac{5\pi}{2}\right) = 1, \quad \left(\frac{\sin(x)}{x}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{7.854}\right)^2 \approx 0.016.
\]

### Third Secondary Maximum
For the third secondary maximum (\(n = 3\)), \(x \approx \frac{7\pi}{2} \approx 11.0\). At this point:
\[
\sin(x) = \sin\left(\frac{7\pi}{2}\right) = -1, \quad \left(\frac{\sin(x)}{x}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{-1}{11.0}\right)^2 \approx 0.0083.
\]

### Comparison with Options
The calculated relative intensities of the first three secondary maxima are approximately \(0.045\), \(0.016\), and \(0.0083\). Comparing these values with the given options, the closest match is:

**Option C: 0.045, 0.016, 0.0083.**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C**
