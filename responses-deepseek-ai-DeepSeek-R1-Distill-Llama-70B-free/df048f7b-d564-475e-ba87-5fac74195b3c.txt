Okay, so I've got this group theory question here, and I'm a bit new to the subject, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question presents two statements and asks about their truth values. Then, based on that, I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

Statement 1 says: If a and b are elements of a group and a is not equal to b, then a squared is not equal to b squared. Hmm, I need to evaluate if this is always true. Well, I remember that in group theory, groups can have elements where different elements can have the same square. For example, in the Klein four-group, which is abelian. Let me think: in the Klein group, every element is its own inverse, so the square of each non-identity element is the identity. So, if a and b are distinct non-identity elements, a squared equals b squared because both are e. So in that case, Statement 1 would be false because a is not equal to b, but a² equals b². So Statement 1 is not always true. That makes Statement 1 false.

Now, Statement 2: The set of rotations in a dihedral group form a cyclic subgroup. Okay, dihedral groups are the groups of symmetries of regular polygons, right? They include rotations and reflections. The rotations themselves form a subgroup. I think that the rotation subgroup is cyclic because the rotations can be generated by a single element, like rotating by 360/n degrees each time. So, for example, in D_3 (the dihedral group of order 6), the rotations are 0°, 120°, and 240°, which form a cyclic subgroup of order 3. So yes, the set of rotations in any dihedral group is a cyclic subgroup. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but let me make sure about Statement 1. I remember that in some groups, even non-abelian ones, you can have a² = b² without a = b or a being the inverse of b. For example, in S_3, the symmetric group on 3 elements, let's see: take the transpositions (1 2) and (1 3). Their squares would be the identity permutation, same as each other, but they are distinct elements. So again, a² = b² even though a ≠ b, and they are not inverses of each other. Wait, no, in S_3, the inverse of a transposition is itself, so (1 2) is its own inverse, same with (1 3). So in that case, a and b are inverses of themselves, but not inverses of each other. Wait, no, actually, in that case, a squared is e, and b squared is e, so they are equal. So Statement 1 is false in this case too.

So Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true.

Now, looking at the options:

Option G says: False, True. Which matches our evaluation. So option G is the correct answer.

Let me just double-check the other options to make sure I'm not making a mistake. 

Option A: False, True only for Abelian groups. Wait, Statement 2 is true for any dihedral group, whether the group is abelian or not. Wait, dihedral groups are non-abelian except for D1 or D2, which are trivial. So Statement 2 being true doesn't depend on the group being abelian. So A is saying Statement 2 is true only for Abelian groups, which isn't the case. So A is incorrect.

Option B: True, True only if a and b are inverses. No, because Statement 1 is false, so B is out.

Option C: False, False only if a and b are not inverses. No, because Statement 2 is true, so C is incorrect.

Option D: True, False. No, because Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true. D is opposite.

Option E: True, False only for non-cyclic groups. Again, Statement 1 is false, so E is incorrect.

Option F: True, True. No, because Statement 1 is false.

Option G: False, True. Yes, that's correct.

Option H: True, True only for non-Abelian groups. No, Statement 1 is false, so H is wrong.

Option I: False, False. No, because Statement 2 is true.

Option J: False, True only for groups of even order. No, because Statement 2 is always true for dihedral groups, regardless of the order being even or odd. Wait, actually, dihedral groups are usually considered for n≥3, and n can be any integer. For example, D3 has order 6 (even), D4 has order 8 (even), but D5 has order 10 (even) as well. Wait, actually, the dihedral group Dn has order 2n, which is always even except when n=1, which is trivial. So rotations form a cyclic subgroup of order n, but the dihedral group's order is 2n, which is even for n≥2. So Statement 2 is true for dihedral groups regardless of n being even or odd, as long as n≥3. So J's condition is not correct because Statement 2 is always true for dihedral groups, not only when the group has even order. Wait, but all dihedral groups of order ≥3 have even order. So maybe Statement 2's truth doesn't depend on the group's order being even, but the point is that Statement 2 is always true for dihedral groups, so J's option is not correct because it's adding an unnecessary condition.

So the correct option is G: False, True.

Statement 1: If \(a\) and \(b\) are elements of a group and \(a \neq b\), then \(a^2 \neq b^2\).  
This statement is false. In some groups, distinct elements can have the same square. For example, in the Klein four-group, every non-identity element squares to the identity, so \(a^2 = b^2 = e\) even though \(a \neq b\). Similarly, in \(S_3\), the transpositions \((1 2)\) and \((1 3)\) are distinct but both square to the identity. Thus, Statement 1 is not always true.

Statement 2: The set of rotations in a dihedral group forms a cyclic subgroup.  
This statement is true. The dihedral group \(D_n\) consists of rotations and reflections of a regular \(n\)-gon. The rotations alone form a subgroup under composition, and this subgroup is cyclic because it can be generated by a single rotation (e.g., a rotation by \(360/n\) degrees). For example, in \(D_3\), the rotations form a cyclic subgroup of order 3. Therefore, Statement 2 is always true for dihedral groups.

Evaluating the options:  
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Statement 2 is true for all dihedral groups, regardless of whether they are Abelian.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 does not depend on \(a\) and \(b\) being inverses.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Statement 2 is true, so this option is invalid.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is not limited to non-cyclic groups.  
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Statement 1 is false, so this option is invalid.  
- **Option G**: Correct. Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true.  
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Statement 1 is false, so this option is invalid.  
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Statement 2 is true, so this option is invalid.  
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Statement 2 is true for all dihedral groups, regardless of whether the group has even or odd order.  

Thus, the correct answer is **G: False, True**.
