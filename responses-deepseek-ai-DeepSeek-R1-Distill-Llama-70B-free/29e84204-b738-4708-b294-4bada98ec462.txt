Okay, so I have this problem here about James discounting a customer's note, and I need to find the term of the discount. Hmm, let me try to break this down. 

Alright, the note is for $500, but I don't think the amount matters here. The key details are the dates and the terms. So the note was discounted on April 25, and it was dated March 1. Oh wait, and it must be paid within 3 months from the issue date.

Wait, so the issue date is March 1, and the payment is due in 3 months. So the due date would be March 1 plus 3 months. Let me think, March has 31 days, so adding three months would take us to June 1. Because March 1 plus one month is April 1, plus another month is May 1, and the third month makes it June 1. So the due date is June 1.

But wait, the question is about the term of the discount. The term is the period between when the note was discounted and when it's due. So James discounted it on April 25, and it's due on June 1. So I need to calculate the number of days between April 25 and June 1.

Let me count the days. April has 30 days, right? So from April 25 to April 30, that's 5 days. Then, May has 31 days. So 31 days in May, plus the 5 days in April makes 36 days. Then, from May 31 to June 1 is 1 day, but wait, do I include June 1? Because the due date is June 1, so the term would be until June 1, but the discounting is up to but not including the due date. Wait, no, when you discount a note, the term is the period from the discount date to the due date, inclusive or exclusive? Hmm. I think it's the days between the two dates, so from April 25 to June 1.

So let me recount. April 25 to April 30: that's 6 days including the 25th? Wait no, wait. If today is the 25th, then tomorrow is the 26th, which is day 1. So from the 25th to the 30th is 5 days. Then May has 31 days, and then June 1 is the next day after May 31. So total days would be 5 (April) + 31 (May) + 1 (June 1) = 37 days. Wait, but does the June 1 count as a day? Because the note is due on June 1, so the term would end on that day. So the term is the number of days from April 25 to June 1 inclusive?

Wait, no. When you calculate the term, it's usually the number of days from the date of discounting to the due date, but not including the discounting date. Wait, no, I think it's the days between the two dates. So for example, if you have two dates, the number of days between them is the difference. So if I have April 25 and June 1, I calculate the days as follows.

April: 30 days. So from April 25 to April 30 is 6 days (including the 25th? No, wait, from the 25th to the 30th is 5 days because you don't count the starting day. Wait, no, let me think again. If today is day 0 (April 25), then April 26 is day 1, up to April 30 which would be day 5. Then May has 31 days, which would be days 6 to 36. Then June 1 is day 37. So the total term is 37 days.

So the term of the discount is 37 days. Looking at the options, option B is 37 days.
</think>

The term of the discount is calculated as the number of days between the date the note was discounted (April 25) and the due date (June 1). 

- From April 25 to April 30: 5 days.
- May: 31 days.
- June 1: 1 day.

Adding these together: 5 + 31 + 1 = 37 days.

Thus, the term of the discount is **37 days**.
