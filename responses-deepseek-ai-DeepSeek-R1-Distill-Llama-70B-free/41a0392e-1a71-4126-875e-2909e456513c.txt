Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about a charge flowing through a light bulb and calculating the work done each second by the electrical source. Hmm. The details are: a charge of 1 C flows from a 100-V outlet, through a 100-W bulb each second. We need to find the work done each second.

Wait, I remember that work done by an electrical source is related to voltage and charge. Oh right, the formula is Work (W) equals voltage (V) multiplied by charge (Q). So W = V * Q. That makes sense because voltage is the potential difference, and moving charge against that difference does work.

So the numbers here are V = 100 volts, Q = 1 coulomb. Plugging into the formula, W = 100 V * 1 C = 100 joules. So the work done each second should be 100 joules. Looking at the options, option A is 100 joules. That seems straightforward.

Wait, but wait a minute. The bulb is 100-W. Power is energy per unit time, so P = W/t. So if the bulb is 100W, that's 100 joules per second. But wait, in this setup, the electrical source is providing the energy, which is the same as the power times time? Because the bulb consumes 100 J each second.

Oh, but the question is about the work done by the source each second, not the bulb's power directly. So maybe the work done by the source is the same as the energy used by the bulb? Because the source is providing the energy that the bulb uses.

Wait, but in this case, the source is doing work on the charge, which then is converted into heat and light in the bulb. So the work done by the source would be the electrical energy provided, which is voltage times charge. Since 1 C flows each second, the current I is 1 A (because I = Q/t, so 1 C/s is 1 A).

Wait, but then using P = V * I, power equals voltage times current. So P = 100 V * 1 A = 100 W. So power is 100 W, which is 100 joules per second. So each second, 100 J of work is done. That matches the earlier calculation.

But wait, the bulb is 100 W. So if it's dissipating 100 J per second, that's consistent. So the source is providing 100 J each second, doing 100 J of work. So that's option A.

But wait, another approach: the energy dissipated in the bulb is I squared times R, right? Because the power P is IÂ² R. But I don't know R here. Alternatively, since we have P = V * I, and I is 1 A, so P is 100 W, so each second, the source provides 100 J.

Yeah, so I think the answer is A: 100 joules.

To determine the work done each second by the electrical source, we use the relationship between work, voltage, and charge. The formula is:

\[
W = V \cdot Q
\]

Here, the voltage \( V \) is 100 V, and the charge \( Q \) flowing each second is 1 C. Substituting these values:

\[
W = 100 \, \text{V} \cdot 1 \, \text{C} = 100 \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the work done by the electrical source each second is 100 joules. This matches the power dissipated by the 100-W bulb, as power \( P \) is energy per unit time (\( P = \frac{W}{t} \)), and the current \( I \) is 1 A (since \( I = \frac{Q}{t} = \frac{1 \, \text{C}}{1 \, \text{s}} = 1 \, \text{A} \)). Using \( P = V \cdot I \), we confirm:

\[
P = 100 \, \text{V} \cdot 1 \, \text{A} = 100 \, \text{W} = 100 \, \text{J/s}
\]

Therefore, the work done by the source each second is consistent with both the voltage-charge and power calculations. The correct answer is:

**A: 100 joules**
