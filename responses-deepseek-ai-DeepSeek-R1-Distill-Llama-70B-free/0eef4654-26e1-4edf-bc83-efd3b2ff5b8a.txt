Question:

A man needed to have the oil changed on his car. On Friday, he decided to take his car to the local dealership to have the oil changed and asked his neighbor if she would give him a ride home from the dealership. The neighbor said, "Why pay the high prices a dealership will charge you? I can change the oil in your car for you. If you will agree to pay me $50, I'll change the oil in your car over the weekend. " The man readily agreed. On Sunday afternoon, the man noticed that his neighbor still had not started working on the car. He asked his neighbor if the car would be ready for him to drive to work Monday morning. The neighbor replied, "I thought about it and realized $50 is too low a price for the work involved. I don't think I'm going to change the oil in your car. " The man then said, "Look, I realize $50 is low for the work involved. If you can change the oil in my car by tomorrow morning, I'll pay you an additional $25. And I won't sue you in small claims court for your failure to perform your promise. " The neighbor then changed the oil late Sunday afternoon, but the man refused to pay to the neighbor anything more than $50. In a suit by the neighbor to recover the additional $25 promised by the man, the neighbor will

Options:

A: lose, because the neighbor had a pre-existing duty to change the oil in the car for $50.
B: win, because the second contract for $75 superseded the original $50 contract.
C: win, because the man willingly offered an additional $25 for the service.
D: win, because the man breached the verbal contract they had.
E: win, because she performed her part of the bargain.
F: win, because the man promised not to sue in small claims court.
G: lose, because the neighbor did not fulfill the initial agreement within the agreed timeframe.
H: lose, because the man's offer of an additional $25 was not legally binding.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read it carefully.

So, the scenario is about a man who needs his car's oil changed. He first thinks about going to the dealership on Friday but then his neighbor offers to do it for $50. They agree, but by Sunday, the neighbor hasn't started and says $50 is too low. The man offers an additional $25 if she does it by Monday, and she does. But then he only pays $50, not the extra $25. She sues for the $25.

I need to determine if she will win or lose.

Hmm, I remember that contract modifications usually require consideration to be binding. So, the original contract was for $50. The man offered an extra $25 to get the job done by Monday. But wait, did the neighbor agree to this new offer? She did perform, so she accepted the new terms, I think.

Wait, but what's the consideration here? The original contract was $50. The man is offering $25 more. But the neighbor was already obligated to do the work for $50. So, is the additional $25 supported by consideration? Or is it a pre-existing duty?

Pre-existing duty rule says that you can't get more for doing what you're already supposed to do. So, if the neighbor was already under a duty to perform for $50, asking for more might not be enforceable because there's no new consideration.

Wait, but the man offered the $25 as an incentive to get her to perform on time. So, maybe the consideration here is that the neighbor agreed to perform by Monday. But originally, when was she supposed to do it? The initial agreement was over the weekend, which would include Sunday. So if she did it Sunday afternoon, she fulfilled the original agreement. But the man's new offer was to pay $75 if she did it by Monday morning. So she actually did it Sunday, which is before Monday.

Alternatively, maybe the original contract didn't specify a timeframe beyond the weekend, so when the neighbor said she wouldn't do it, maybe that was a repudiation. Then the man offered a new contract. If the neighbor accepted by performing, maybe that's a new contract.

But the problem is consideration. The man is offering an additional $25. The neighbor was already supposed to do it for $50. So, if she does it anyway, is the $25 enforceable? Or is the man's promise to pay $25 not binding because there's no consideration from the neighbor beyond what she was already supposed to do.

So, the original contract was for $50 to change the oil over the weekend. She didn't start on Sunday, so maybe she was in breach. The man offered to pay $75 if she does it by Monday, which is an offer to modify the contract. She then does it on Sunday, which was within the original timeframe, so she performed as per the original contract.

Wait, but the original contract was to change the oil over the weekend, so by Sunday she had to do it. So when she didn't start, she was in breach. Then the man offered to pay $75 if she does it by Monday morning. She agreed and did it Sunday afternoon. So, she performed under the new agreement.

But is the modification of the contract valid? The original consideration was the neighbor's promise to change the oil for $50. The modification would require new consideration. The man is offering $25 more, but the neighbor is not giving anything new. She was already bound to do it. So, the additional $25 might not be enforceable because there's no consideration for it.

In that case, the man's promise to pay $25 extra isn't binding, so the neighbor can't recover it. So she would lose the suit for the additional $25.

Looking at the options, option A says she loses because she had a pre-existing duty. Option H says she loses because the man's offer wasn't legally binding. Wait, but the issue is consideration, so A is about pre-existing duty, which aligns with the rule that you can't have additional consideration for doing what you're already supposed to do.

Wait, but the modification is about changing the price. So, if the original contract was $50, and the new offer is $75, but the neighbor doesn't provide anything beyond the original duty. So, no consideration for the modification. Therefore, the modification isn't enforceable, so the neighbor can't get the extra $25.

So, the correct answer should be that the neighbor loses because there's no consideration for the additional $25. So, which option is that? Let me check the options again.

Option A: lose because of pre-existing duty to change for $50.

Option H: lose because man's offer wasn't binding.

Wait, the man's offer was a modification. If the neighbor accepted and performed, then the question is whether the modification is enforceable.

So, under the pre-existing duty rule, the neighbor can't demand more unless there's new consideration. The man's offer of $25 extra doesn't have consideration because she was already bound. So, the contract remains at $50. So, the neighbor can't recover the extra.

Thus, the answer should be A, because the pre-existing duty means no consideration for the extra payment.

Alternatively, option H says the man's offer wasn't legally binding. But the reason would be lack of consideration, which ties back to pre-existing duty.

Wait, but the man's offer was $25 more. So, perhaps he's trying to modify the contract. But without consideration, the modification isn't valid. So, the initial contract remains at $50. So the neighbor can't get more.

So the correct answer is A: lose because of pre-existing duty.

But looking again, the man's offer was to pay an additional $25, and not to sue. So, perhaps the not suing part could be consideration. Because the man was offering not to sue in exchange for performance. So, that might count as consideration.

Wait, the man said, "I'll pay you an additional $25. And I won't sue you in small claims court for your failure to perform your promise." So, he's offering two things: $25 extra and not suing. So, perhaps the forbearance of the lawsuit is the consideration.

Wait, but forbearance must be a legal right. The man had a right to sue for breach. By agreeing not to sue, he's giving up that right. So, that could be consideration for the neighbor's promise to perform.

But in this case, the neighbor had already breached by not performing. So, the man's forbearance would be consideration for the neighbor's performance. So, the modification would be supported by consideration.

If that's the case, then the modification is valid, and the neighbor can collect the $75.

Wait, but I'm getting confused now. Let me think.

The original contract: $50 for oil change over the weekend.

Neighbor breaches by not starting on time.

Man offers: $75 and I won't sue if you do it by Monday.

Neighbor does it Sunday afternoon (within the original timeframe, but after the man's offer).

So, the man's offer was to pay more and not to sue. The neighbor accepted by performing.

So, the consideration for the additional $25 could be the man's promise not to sue. Because he's forbearing his legal right to sue for the breach.

In that case, the modification would be enforceable because there's consideration. So, the neighbor would be entitled to the $75.

Wait, but the man only paid $50. The neighbor is suing for the extra $25.

So, if the modification is valid, the neighbor can collect $75. So, she would win.

Looking at the options, option B says she wins because the second contract supersedes the first. Option C says she wins because the man offered $25. Option F says she wins because the man promised not to sue.

Wait, so if the consideration is the man's forbearance, then option F could be relevant. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, option B says the second contract ($75) supersedes the first. So, if the second contract is valid, she can get $75.

But earlier, I thought that without consideration, the modification isn't valid. But if the man's forbearance is consideration, then it is valid.

So, the answer would be that she wins because the second contract is valid. So option B.

Wait, but the initial agreement was to do it over the weekend, which includes Sunday. She did it Sunday afternoon, so she actually performed under the original contract. So, the man's offer was for her to do it by Monday, but she did it Sunday.

Does that affect anything? Well, she still performed as per the original contract, but perhaps also under the new agreement.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to outline the key points.

1. Original contract: $50, change oil over the weekend (Friday to Sunday).

2. Neighbor didn't start on Sunday, so breach appeared imminent.

3. Man offers to pay $75 and not sue if she does it by Monday.

4. She does it Sunday afternoon.

So, she performed under both contracts? Or did she accept the new offer?

If she accepted the new offer by performing, then the new contract is in effect. The consideration for the additional $25 is the man's forbearance of his right to sue. So, that's valid consideration.

Therefore, the modified contract is enforceable, and she can collect $75.

So the answer would be option B: win, because the second contract supersedes the original.

Alternatively, option F: she wins because the man promised not to sue.

But wait, the consideration is the forbearance, which is the man giving up his right to sue. So, that makes the modification valid.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but I'm a bit torn because the neighbor was already supposed to perform. So, the additional $25 is for the same performance. Without additional consideration beyond the original duty, the modification isn't valid. So, the only consideration here is the man's forbearance.

So, if the forbearance is valid consideration, then the modification holds.

Yes, I think that's the case. So, the answer is B.

The question revolves around contract law, specifically the enforceability of a contract modification. Here's the analysis:

1. **Original Contract**: The neighbor agreed to change the oil for $50 over the weekend. This established a binding contract with mutual promises: the neighbor would perform the service, and the man would pay $50.

2. **Breach and New Offer**: When the neighbor indicated she would not perform for $50, the man offered a modified contract: $75 ($50 + $25 extra) and a promise not to sue in small claims court if she performed by Monday morning. The neighbor accepted this offer by performing the service on Sunday afternoon.

3. **Consideration for Modification**: Contract modifications require new consideration to be enforceable. The man's promise not to sue constitutes valid consideration because it involves forbearing a legal right (the right to sue for breach). This makes the modification enforceable.

4. **Performance**: The neighbor performed the service on Sunday afternoon, which was within the original timeframe ("over the weekend"). However, by accepting the modified terms, she also bound herself to the new agreement, which included the additional $25.

5. **Conclusion**: The second contract for $75 supersedes the original $50 contract because it was supported by valid consideration (the man's forbearance of his right to sue). Therefore, the neighbor is entitled to the additional $25.

**Evaluation of Options**:
- **A**: Incorrect. While the pre-existing duty rule applies to the original $50 contract, the modification was supported by new consideration (the man's forbearance).
- **B**: Correct. The second contract for $75 supersedes the original $50 contract because it was supported by valid consideration.
- **C**: Incorrect. The man's willingness to offer $25 is not sufficient alone; the modification required consideration, which was provided by the forbearance.
- **D**: Incorrect. The man did not breach the contract; he modified it with valid consideration.
- **E**: Incorrect. Performance alone does not explain why the modified contract is enforceable.
- **F**: Incorrect. While the promise not to sue was part of the consideration, the correct reasoning is that the second contract supersedes the first.
- **G**: Incorrect. The neighbor fulfilled the modified agreement, so this option does not apply.
- **H**: Incorrect. The man's offer was legally binding because it was supported by consideration.

**Answer**: B
