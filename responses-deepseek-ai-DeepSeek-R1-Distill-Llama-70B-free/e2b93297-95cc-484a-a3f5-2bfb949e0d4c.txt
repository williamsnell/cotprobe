Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. The question is asking how many numbers are in the list starting from 25 and going up to 100, including both 25 and 100. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that when counting numbers in a sequence like this, there's a formula or method to find out how many terms there are without having to count each one individually. I think it's something like subtracting the smaller number from the larger one and then adding one because both endpoints are included. Let me think about that again.

So the formula I recall is: number of terms = (last term - first term) + 1. Yeah, that sounds right. Let me apply that here. The first term is 25, and the last term is 100.

So plugging in the numbers: (100 - 25) + 1. Let's do the math. 100 minus 25 is 75, and then adding 1 gives 76. So that should be the number of terms.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. Suppose I have a smaller example, like from 3 to 5. That includes 3,4,5. So using the formula: (5-3)+1 = 3, which is correct. So yes, that works.

Another example: from 10 to 10. That's just one number. Applying the formula: (10-10)+1=1. Correct again.

So applying the same logic to 25 to 100: 100-25=75, plus 1 is 76. So the answer should be 76.

Looking back at the options, option I is 76. So the correct answer should be I.

The number of terms in the list from 25 to 100 inclusive is calculated using the formula:  
**(last term - first term) + 1**.  
Plugging in the values:  
**(100 - 25) + 1 = 75 + 1 = 76**.  

Thus, the correct answer is **76**, which corresponds to option **I**.
