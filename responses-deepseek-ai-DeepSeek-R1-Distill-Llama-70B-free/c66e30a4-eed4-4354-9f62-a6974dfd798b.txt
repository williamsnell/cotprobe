Okay, so I've got this problem here about two signals, x(t) and v(t), and I need to find y(τ) when τ is 2.5. Hmm. Let me try to understand what's going on.

First, I remember that y(τ) is defined as the integral from negative infinity to positive infinity of x(τ - t) multiplied by v(t) dt. Oh wait, that sounds like a convolution integral. Right, because convolution is when you flip one signal, slide it over, and integrate the product. So y(τ) is basically the convolution of x and v evaluated at τ=2.5.

Let me write down what x(t) and v(t) look like. So x(t) is 1 between t=0 and t=3, and zero otherwise. So it's a rectangular pulse starting at 0 and ending at 3. Similarly, v(t) is 1 from t=0 to t=2, zero elsewhere. Also a rectangular pulse, but shorter.

Since y is the convolution of x and v, I should probably sketch their graphs to visualize this. For convolution, I think you flip one of the functions (like v(t)) and then shift it by τ and see where the overlap occurs.

Wait, but the integral is over all t, so for each t, I have x(τ - t) and v(t). So for a given τ, I need to find all t where both x(τ-t) and v(t) are non-zero. Because the product will be non-zero only where both are 1.

Let me think about the regions where both x(τ-t) and v(t) are 1.

So, x(τ-t) is 1 when 0 ≤ τ - t ≤ 3. That means τ - 3 ≤ t ≤ τ. Because if I rearrange 0 ≤ τ - t ≤3, subtract τ, I get -τ ≤ -t ≤3 - τ. Multiply by -1 (and reverse inequalities) gives τ -3 ≤ t ≤ τ.

And v(t) is 1 when 0 ≤ t ≤ 2.

So the product x(τ-t)v(t) is 1 only where both conditions are satisfied. So the overlap occurs when t is in the intersection of [τ-3, τ] and [0,2].

So I need to find the t's that are in both intervals.

Given τ=2.5, let's plug that in.

So τ=2.5. The interval for x becomes [2.5 -3, 2.5] → [-0.5, 2.5]. The interval for v(t) is [0,2].

The intersection of [-0.5, 2.5] and [0,2] is [0, 2], because that's where both overlap.

So the integral becomes the integral from t=0 to t=2 of 1*1 dt, which is just the length of the interval where both are 1. So from 0 to 2 is 2 units. So y(2.5) would be 2?

Wait wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check.

Wait, the intervals:

x(τ - t) is 1 when 0 ≤ τ - t ≤3 → t ≥ τ -3 and t ≤ τ.

So for τ=2.5, t ranges from 2.5 -3 = -0.5 to 2.5.

v(t) is 1 when 0 ≤ t ≤2.

So the overlap is from t=0 to t=2, because that's where both are non-zero.

So the integral is over t=0 to t=2, and since x and v are both 1 in this region, their product is 1. So the integral is 2-0=2. So y(2.5)=2.

Looking at the options, option C is 2. So the answer should be C.

To determine \( y(\tau) \) for \( \tau = 2.5 \), we recognize that \( y(\tau) \) is the convolution of \( x(t) \) and \( v(t) \). The convolution integral is given by:

\[
y(\tau) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau - t) v(t) \, dt
\]

The signals are defined as:
- \( x(t) = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } 0 \leq t \leq 3, \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases} \)
- \( v(t) = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } 0 \leq t \leq 2, \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases} \)

For \( \tau = 2.5 \), we need to evaluate the integral. The product \( x(\tau - t) v(t) \) is nonzero only where both signals overlap. The conditions for \( x(\tau - t) \) being nonzero are \( \tau - 3 \leq t \leq \tau \), which simplifies to \( -0.5 \leq t \leq 2.5 \) for \( \tau = 2.5 \). The conditions for \( v(t) \) being nonzero are \( 0 \leq t \leq 2 \). The overlap of these intervals is \( 0 \leq t \leq 2 \).

Thus, the integral reduces to:

\[
y(2.5) = \int_{0}^{2} 1 \cdot 1 \, dt = \int_{0}^{2} 1 \, dt = 2
\]

Therefore, \( y(2.5) = 2 \), and the correct answer is:

**C**
