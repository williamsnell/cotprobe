Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Nagel and the problem of moral luck. Hmm, I remember that moral luck is a concept in philosophy, particularly discussed by Thomas Nagel. Let me think about what I know about this.

From what I recall, Nagel's argument is about how our moral judgments are influenced by factors that are beyond our control, which he considers a problem. So, the idea is that luck plays a role in morality, but our moral theories don't account for that properly. 

Wait, the problem arises because even though we think our moral assessments should be based on things we can control, in reality, factors like luck (which we can't control) affect how we judge people. For example, imagine two people who make the same decision, but one leads to a bad outcome due to bad luck, and the other doesn't. We tend to judge them differently, even though their actions were the same. That seems to be the crux of the problem.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Moral theories don't take into account the element of luck. That sounds plausible because Nagel argues that luck influences our moral judgments, but our theories don't handle this well.

Option B: Too much emphasis on individual responsibility. I'm not sure. Nagel might be pointing out that we do focus on individual responsibility, but the problem is that luck affects outcomes beyond that control.

Option C: Our understanding is limited by inability to predict outcomes. I don't think that's the main point. It's more about how luck affects our moral assessments even when the actions are the same.

Option D: The self is threatened... into events. That rings a bell. I think Nagel talks about how our sense of self is tied to our actions, and when luck influences outcomes, it's like our actions are part of larger, uncontrollable events, which undermines our moral responsibility. So maybe this is the right answer.

Option E: Philosophers focus too much on chance. I don't think that's the issue he's raising. It's more about how moral theories don't account for luck.

Option F: Applying stringent standards. Not sure, but I think it's more about the influence of luck than the stringency of standards.

Option G: Morality is entirely dependent on luck. That seems too extreme. Nagel's point is more about the influence, not that morality is entirely based on luck.

Option H: Moral theories are off track. I think that's part of the problem, but the question is about why the problem arises. So maybe A or D is better.

Option I: Theories of human action are off track. Maybe, but I think it's more about moral theories specifically.

Option J: Luck incompatible with morality. I don't think he says that. He's pointing out that luck affects morality, not that they are incompatible.

So now I'm a bit torn between A and D. Option A says that moral theories don't account for luck. That seems correct because Nagel argues that our theories can't handle the fact that luck affects moral judgments. But I also remember that Nagel's formulation of the problem is about how luck seems to influence our moral responsibility, which shouldn't be the case if our theories are correct. So the problem arises because our theories don't have a place for luck, making it seem like luck affects moral responsibility, which it shouldn't according to the theories.

Alternatively, Option D is about the self being threatened by absorption into events, which I think relates to the idea that when we consider the role of luck, our actions seem more part of a larger chain of events beyond our control. This might undermine the idea that we can be morally responsible because our actions are part of these events, not solely our doing.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up some concepts. The problem of moral luck is that our moral assessments are influenced by factors beyond the agent's control, which shouldn't matter if moral responsibility is based on what the agent can control. So the problem is that luck affects our judgments, and our theories don't account for that. So the problem arises because our theories don't take luck into account, making option A the correct choice.

But wait, another angle: Nagel argues that luck makes it seem like our moral responsibility is based on things beyond our control, which challenges the idea of moral responsibility. So the problem arises because luck affects our moral judgments, which our theories don't properly handle. Therefore, the problem stems from moral theories not considering luck, which is option A.

Alternatively, I remember that Nagel's formulation of the problem is about how the self is threatened because our actions are part of a larger set of events influenced by luck, which our moral theories can't reconcile. So perhaps option D is the correct answer.

Wait, maybe I should think about the exact phrasing of the question. The question is, according to Nagel, the problem arises because... So what is the root cause he identifies?

Nagel discusses four types of moral luck: resultant, circumstantial, constitutive, and causal. The core issue is that our moral judgments are influenced by luck, which seems irrational because luck is beyond our control. So the problem is that our moral theories don't account for luck, leading to situations where people are judged differently based on factors they can't control.

So the problem arises because moral theories don't take into account the element of luck. That would be option A. But wait, another thought: the problem arises because luck influences our moral assessments, which our theories don't handle. So the answer is A.

But now I'm getting confused because I thought D was about the absorption into events, which is another aspect. I'm a bit stuck here.

Let me try to recall: In "Moral Luck," Nagel argues that our ordinary moral judgments are influenced by factors outside our control, which he calls luck. This is problematic because it seems irrational. So the problem arises because our theories don't account for luck, meaning they can't explain why luck affects moral judgments. So option A is the problem.

Alternatively, the problem arises because the self is part of a larger causal chain, making it hard to assign responsibility. That would be option D.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of Nagel's argument. He says that when we reflect on morality, we want to separate what is under our control from what isn't. But our actual moral judgments don't do this; they are influenced by luck. So the problem is that our theories don't take luck into account, leading to inconsistency between theory and practice.

So the correct answer would be A: moral theories don't take into account the element of luck.

But wait, I'm now doubting myself because I think that in Nagel's view, the problem is that our moral evaluations are affected by luck, which our theories (which are supposed to be based on what we can control) cannot accommodate. So the problem arises because our theories ignore luck, making option A correct.

Alternatively, some sources might phrase it differently, like the self being threatened. But I'm more confident now that the problem is that theories don't account for luck, so the answer is A.

The problem of moral luck, as discussed by Thomas Nagel, arises because moral theories fail to account for the influence of luck on moral judgments. Nagel argues that our moral assessments are often affected by factors beyond our control, such as luck, which seems irrational because moral responsibility should ideally be based on what individuals can control. This discrepancy between the influence of luck in practice and the lack of consideration for it in moral theories creates the problem of moral luck. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: moral theories don't take into account the element of luck.**
