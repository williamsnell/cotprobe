Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about searching a sorted list of integers. The question is, if I have a sorted list of 120 integers and I'm searching for the value 100, what's the maximum number of elements I need to examine if I use the most efficient algorithm?

Hmm, I remember that for searching, the most efficient algorithm for a sorted list is binary search. Binary search is way faster than linear search because it cuts the list in half each time. So I shouldn't even be thinking about linear search here.

Wait, right, binary search works by repeatedly dividing the list in half. So for each step, you compare the middle element with the target. If the target is larger, you go to the right half; if smaller, the left half. This continues until you find the target or determine it's not there.

So the question is about the maximum number of elements examined. That would be the worst-case scenario, which is when the element is either at the end of the search or not present at all. Because binary search could take more steps in that case.

I recall that the number of steps in binary search is determined by the logarithm base 2 of the number of elements. Oh wait, but it's the ceiling of log2(n), right? Because even if it's not a power of two, you round up.

Let me think about the formula. The maximum number of comparisons in binary search is the ceiling of log2(n+1). Or wait, is it log2(n)? I get a bit confused here. Let me double-check.

Wait, the maximum number of comparisons required for binary search in a list of size n is floor(log2(n)) + 1. Because each comparison effectively halves the search space, and you need to account for each step until the element is found.

So for n = 120, let's compute log2(120). I know that 2^6 is 64, 2^7 is 128. So log2(120) is a little less than 7, maybe around 6.9. So the floor would be 6, and adding 1 gives 7 steps.

Wait, but waitâ€”each step examines one element, right? So the number of elements examined is the same as the number of steps. So in the worst case, you might have to check up to 7 elements.

So the maximum number of elements that must be examined is 7.

Looking back at the options, option F is 7. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix anything up. Let's simulate a small example. Suppose n=8, which is 2^3. So log2(8)=3. So the maximum steps would be 3. Let's see:

If the list is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], and we're searching for 8.

First step: mid is 4, which is less than 8. Move right.
Second step: mid is 6, still less. Move right.
Third step: mid is 8. Found it. So that's 3 steps. Which matches log2(8)=3.

What if n=9?

log2(9) is about 3.169, so floor is 3, +1=4 steps.

Testing with n=9:

List [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. Searching for 9.

First mid (5), less than 9: go right.
Second mid (8), less than 9: go right.
Third mid (9): found it. Wait, that's only 3 steps. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is slightly different. Let me think again.

In binary search, the number of steps needed to find an element in the worst case is the number of times you can divide the list until you get to one element.

So for n elements, the maximum steps are the smallest integer k where 2^k >= n+1. Or maybe it's 2^k >= n? Hmm.

Wait, another way: the maximum number of comparisons is the number of times you can halve the array until you're left with one.

For example, n=1: 1 step.
n=2: 2 steps (compare middle, then check other)
Wait, maybe I should use a formula that says the maximum number is the ceiling of log2(n+1).

Wait, let me check.

No, perhaps I should think in terms of the maximum number of steps. For n elements, the maximum number of steps is the ceiling of log2(n) rounded up to the next integer.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the maximum number of comparisons as being the floor of log2(n) +1.

So for n=120, log2(120) is approximately 6.906. So floor is 6, plus 1 is 7. So 7 steps, which would examine 7 elements.

So the answer is F:7.

I think that's correct. So the maximum number of elements examined would be 7.

To determine the maximum number of elements that must be examined when searching for the value 100 in a sorted list of 120 integers using the most efficient algorithm, we consider binary search. Binary search is the optimal algorithm for this scenario, as it reduces the search space by half in each step.

The worst-case scenario for binary search occurs when the target element is either the last element in the list or not present at all. The maximum number of steps required in binary search is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Maximum steps} = \lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1
\]

For \( n = 120 \), we calculate:

\[
\log_2(120) \approx 6.906
\]

Taking the floor value gives \( \lfloor \log_2(120) \rfloor = 6 \), and adding 1 results in:

\[
\text{Maximum steps} = 6 + 1 = 7
\]

Thus, in the worst case, binary search examines 7 elements. This corresponds to option **F**.
