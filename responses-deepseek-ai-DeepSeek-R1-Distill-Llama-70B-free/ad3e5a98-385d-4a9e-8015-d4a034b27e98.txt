Question:

Consider the distribution of the previous problem. Let us add 2 relatively high values in order to observe the differential effecton the three measures of central tendency. Use the followingeight ordered values: 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 9, 16, 20.

Options:

A: Mean is unaffected, median is somewhat affected, mode is most affected
B: Median is most affected, mean is somewhat affected, mode is unaffected
C: All measures are unaffected
D: Mean and median are equally affected, mode is most affected
E: All measures are equally affected
F: Mean is most affected, median is somewhat affected, mode is unaffected
G: Median is unaffected, mean and mode are equally affected
H: Mode and median are equally affected, mean is unaffected
I: Mode is unaffected, mean is somewhat affected, median is most affected
J: Mode is most affected, median is somewhat affected, mean is unaffected

Okay, so I need to figure out this statistics question. Let's take it step by step. The problem is about measures of central tendency—mean, median, and mode—and how adding two high values affects each.

The given data set is: 3,5,6,6,7,9,16,20. So there are 8 numbers. I remember that when you add data points, especially high ones, it can affect these measures differently.

First, I should probably calculate the original mean, median, and mode. Then, after adding the two high values, recalculate them to see the changes.

Wait, but wait—I think the question says that we add two relatively high values. Oh wait, no, the question actually says we're considering the distribution of the previous problem. But in this case, the given data has already added those two high values. Because the initial data in the previous problem was 3,5,6,6,7,9, and now it's 3,5,6,6,7,9,16,20. So the original data had 6 numbers, now it's 8 with 16 and 20 added.

Wait, no, the question says "add 2 relatively high values in order to observe the differential effect on the three measures." So the given data after adding is 3,5,6,6,7,9,16,20. So I think the original data was 3,5,6,6,7,9. Then we added 16 and 20.

So I should probably find the original measures and then the new ones to compare.

First, let's find the original data's measures (before adding 16 and 20):

Original data: 3,5,6,6,7,9.

Mean: (3+5+6+6+7+9)/6 = (3+5=8; 8+6=14; 14+6=20; 20+7=27; 27+9=36) → 36/6 =6.

Median: Since even number of terms, average of 3rd and 4th. (6 +6)/2=6.

Mode: The most frequent number. 6 appears twice, others once. So mode is 6.

Now, after adding two high values, 16 and 20. New data is 3,5,6,6,7,9,16,20. Now n=8.

Mean: (3+5+6+6+7+9+16+20) → let's sum: 3+5=8; +6=14; +6=20; +7=27; +9=36; +16=52; +20=72. So 72 /8 =9.

Median: For even n=8, average of 4th and 5th terms. The sorted data is 3,5,6,6,7,9,16,20. 4th term is 6, 5th is7. (6+7)/2=6.5.

Mode: Still 6 because it appears twice; others once.

Now, let's compare before and after.

Original mean: 6 → new mean:9. So mean increased by 3. So it's affected.

Original median:6 → new median:6.5. So it increased by 0.5.

Original mode:6 → new mode:6. No change.

So how much each measure is affected.

Mean went from 6 to 9: a significant change.

Median from 6 to 6.5: a smaller change.

Mode stayed the same.

So which measure is most affected? The mean, because it changed the most.

Which is somewhat affected? The median changed, but less than the mean.

Mode is unaffected.

So the question is asking about the effect of adding two high values on the three measures. So which of the options says that the mean is most affected, median somewhat, mode unaffected.

Looking at the options:

Option F: Mean is most affected, median is somewhat affected, mode is unaffected.

Option I: Mode is unaffected, mean is somewhat affected, median is most affected. No, that doesn't fit.

Option F is correct. Let me check the other options.

Option A: Mean unaffected. No, because the mean changed.

Option B: Median most affected. No, mean changed more.

Option F: Yes, that seems right.

To analyze how adding two relatively high values (16 and 20) affects the measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode), we compare the original data set \( \{3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 9\} \) with the new data set \( \{3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 9, 16, 20\} \).

### Original Data:
- **Mean**: \( \frac{3 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 9}{6} = 6 \)
- **Median**: Average of the 3rd and 4th terms: \( \frac{6 + 6}{2} = 6 \)
- **Mode**: The most frequent value, which is \( 6 \).

### New Data:
- **Mean**: \( \frac{3 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 16 + 20}{8} = 9 \)
- **Median**: Average of the 4th and 5th terms: \( \frac{6 + 7}{2} = 6.5 \)
- **Mode**: Still \( 6 \), as it remains the most frequent value.

### Changes:
- **Mean**: Increased from 6 to 9, showing a significant change.
- **Median**: Increased from 6 to 6.5, showing a smaller change.
- **Mode**: Unchanged.

### Conclusion:
The mean is most affected, the median is somewhat affected, and the mode is unaffected. This matches **Option F**.
