Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about marbles colliding. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on collisions, but I remember something about conservation of momentum. Hmm.

So the problem says a 100-gram marble strikes a 25-gram marble that's lying on a smooth horizontal surface. The big marble's speed drops from 100 cm/sec to 60 cm/sec after the impact. I need to find the speed of the smaller marble right after the collision.

Wait, marbles... so they're spheres, right? And the collision is probably elastic, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, the problem doesn't say anything about being elastic or inelastic. Hmm, but since it's a smooth surface, maybe friction isn't a factor, so we can focus on the collision itself.

Right, in collisions, momentum is conserved. That's the key here. So the total momentum before the impact should equal the total momentum after.

Let me write down what I know. The masses are 100 grams and 25 grams. The initial velocity of the 100g marble is 100 cm/s. After the collision, it's 60 cm/s, and the 25g marble was initially at rest, I think. So its initial velocity is 0.

So, the initial momentum is the sum of the momenta of both marbles before the collision. Since the smaller one is at rest, its momentum is zero. So initial momentum is just (100g) * (100 cm/s). 

Wait, but units. Grams are a bit tricky. Oh, but since both masses are in grams and velocities in cm/s, the units should cancel out as long as we're consistent.

So initial momentum (p_initial) is 100g * 100 cm/s = 10,000 g.cm/s.

After the collision, the big marble has a velocity of 60 cm/s, and the small one has some velocity v, which is what we're looking for. So the total momentum after is (100g * 60 cm/s) + (25g * v).

Setting initial equal to final:

10,000 = (100 * 60) + (25 * v)

Let me compute 100*60. That's 6000. So:

10,000 = 6000 + 25v

Subtracting 6000 from both sides: 4000 = 25v

So v = 4000 / 25. Let's compute that. 4000 divided by 25 is... 160? Because 25 times 160 is 4000. Yeah.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have missed something. Does the direction matter? Oh wait, in collisions, if they're moving in opposite directions, the momentum could subtract. But in this case, since the small marble was at rest and the big one was moving, after collision, the big one is still moving in the same direction, and the small one starts moving too. So I think the setup is correct.

Wait, another thought: the problem says the larger marble's speed is reduced. So it's hitting the smaller one head-on. So all the motion is along the same line. So the setup is correct.

So the speed of the smaller marble should be 160 cm/s. Looking at the options, option C is 160. So the answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we apply the principle of conservation of momentum, which states that the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision.

### Given:
- Mass of the larger marble: \( m_1 = 100 \, \text{g} \)
- Mass of the smaller marble: \( m_2 = 25 \, \text{g} \)
- Initial velocity of the larger marble: \( u_1 = 100 \, \text{cm/s} \)
- Initial velocity of the smaller marble: \( u_2 = 0 \, \text{cm/s} \) (since it is at rest)
- Final velocity of the larger marble: \( v_1 = 60 \, \text{cm/s} \)
- Final velocity of the smaller marble: \( v_2 = ? \)

### Step 1: Write the conservation of momentum equation
\[
m_1 u_1 + m_2 u_2 = m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
100 \cdot 100 + 25 \cdot 0 = 100 \cdot 60 + 25 \cdot v_2
\]

Simplify:
\[
10,000 = 6,000 + 25v_2
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( v_2 \)
Subtract \( 6,000 \) from both sides:
\[
4,000 = 25v_2
\]

Divide by \( 25 \):
\[
v_2 = \frac{4,000}{25} = 160 \, \text{cm/s}
\]

### Conclusion:
The speed of the smaller marble immediately after the impact is \( 160 \, \text{cm/s} \). This corresponds to option **C**.
