Okay, so I've got this question about the speed of data transmission in a 4G network. Hmm, I remember that 4G is the fourth generation of mobile networks, right? It came after 3G and before 5G. I think 4G is known for being faster than 3G, which was pretty slow compared to today's standards.

Wait, what were the typical speeds for each generation? Let me think. I recall that 3G speeds were maybe around a few megabits per second. Like, I think 3G could go up to 2 Mbps or something? But 4G is way faster. I've heard people talk about downloading movies quickly on 4G, so it must be at least 10 Mbps or higher.

I remember reading somewhere that 4G can go up to 100 Mbps or even a gigabit in some cases. Oh wait, but that's under ideal conditions, right? Like, in real-world scenarios, it's usually lower, but the theoretical max is higher. So the options here are asking about the speed range.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option B is 50 Mbps to 500 Mbps. That sounds plausible. Option D is 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps. That also seems possible because I've heard of 4G LTE sometimes reaching up to 1 Gbps. Option H is 1 Gbps to 10 Gbps, but that feels more like 5G speeds, doesn't it? I think 5G is the one that goes into gigabits per second more commonly.

Wait, another thought: I've seen some sources say that 4G can theoretically reach up to 1 Gbps, but in practice, it's often lower. So the range might be from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps. But then I'm not sure if the lower end is 100 Mbps or if it starts lower.

Looking again, option D says 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps. Option B is 50 to 500. So which is correct? I think the actual 4G speeds typically range from about 100 Mbps up, so option D might be the right one. But wait, another option is H: 1 Gbps to 10 Gbps. No, that's probably 5G. 

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact numbers. Let me think again. 4G LTE's maximum speed is around 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps, but in reality, average speeds are lower. So the question is about the speed in 4G, not the average, but the general range.

So looking at the options again:

Option D: 100 mbps - 1 gbps. That fits what I was thinking.

Option H is higher, which I think is 5G.

So the correct answer should be D.

The speed of data transmission in a 4G network typically ranges from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps. This range reflects the theoretical maximum speeds under ideal conditions, with actual real-world speeds often being lower but still significantly faster than previous generations like 3G. Among the provided options, the correct range that aligns with 4G capabilities is 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps.

Answer: D
