Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about psychology concepts, specifically related to operant conditioning. Let me break it down step by step to figure out the correct answer.

The question is: In time-out, a disruptive child who wants to stay with his or her class is removed from the classroom. This exemplifies which concept?

The options are A through J, each representing different psychological terms. I need to remember what each of these terms means to determine the correct answer.

First, I recall that operant conditioning is a type of learning in which behavior is modified by its consequences, such as rewards or punishments. The key figures here are B.F. Skinner, who talked a lot about this.

Now, the scenario involves a child being disruptive. The child is removed from the classroom during time-out. The child wants to stay with the class, so the time-out is removing them from that environment. I think this is a form of punishment because the goal is to decrease the disruptive behavior.

Wait, but punishment can be positive or negative. Positive punishment is when an unpleasant stimulus is added to decrease behavior. Negative punishment is when a pleasant stimulus is removed to decrease behavior.

In this case, the child is removed from the classroom, which is taking away the opportunity to stay with the class. Since the child wants to stay, the classroom environment is a positive stimulus. Removing them takes that away, so this must be negative punishment. Negative punishment is also known as omission training because it's about omitting a positive stimulus.

Looking at the options, let's go through each one to make sure.

A: Negative reinforcement. That's when an unpleasant stimulus is removed to increase behavior. Doesn't fit here because we're trying to decrease behavior.

B: Extrinsic reinforcement. That's about external rewards, like money, not relevant here.

C: Intrinsic reinforcement. Internal rewards, like feeling good. Not applicable.

D: Operant conditioning. This is a broader concept that includes both reinforcement and punishment. The question is asking for a specific example, so it's probably not D.

E: Positive punishment. This would involve adding something unpleasant, like spanking. Here, it's taking something away, not adding.

F: Observational learning. That's learning by watching others. Not related.

G: Omission training. Oh wait, omission training is another term for negative punishment. So this could be G.

H: Positive reinforcement. Adding a reward to increase behavior. Doesn't fit.

I: Classical conditioning. That's about associations, like Pavlov's dogs. Not relevant here.

J: Negative punishment. This fits because a positive stimulus (being in class) is removed to decrease behavior.

Wait, so both G and J seem correct. Omission training is another term for negative punishment. So the correct answer should be either G or J. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

G: omission training

J: negative punishment

I think negative punishment is the more commonly used term in this context. Omission training might be another name, but in the context of the options given, J is the direct term.

So the correct answer should be J: negative punishment.

The question involves a disruptive child being removed from the classroom during time-out, which aims to decrease the unwanted behavior. This scenario describes a situation where a positive stimulus (staying in class) is removed to reduce the behavior, fitting the definition of negative punishment. Negative punishment is also referred to as omission training, but the more commonly used term in this context is negative punishment.
