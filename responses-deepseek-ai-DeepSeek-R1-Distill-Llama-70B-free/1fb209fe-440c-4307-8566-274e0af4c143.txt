To determine which group of numbers is in order from least to greatest, we need to compare the numbers in each option and check if they are arranged in ascending order (from smallest to largest).

Let's analyze each option:

**Option A: 1.6, 1.0, 0.25**  
- 1.6 > 1.0 > 0.25, so this is **not** in order from least to greatest.

**Option B: 0.25, 1.6, 1.0**  
- 0.25 < 1.6, but 1.6 > 1.0, so this is **not** in order.

**Option C: 1.0, 1.6, 0.25**  
- 1.0 < 1.6, but 1.6 > 0.25, so this is **not** in order.

**Option D: 1.6, 0.25, 1.6**  
- 1.6 > 0.25, and the last two numbers are equal, so this is **not** in order.

**Option E: 1.0, 0.25, 0.25**  
- 1.0 > 0.25, and the last two numbers are equal, so this is **not** in order.

**Option F: 1.6, 0.25, 1.0**  
- 1.6 > 0.25, and 0.25 < 1.0, but 1.6 > 1.0, so this is **not** in order.

**Option G: 0.25, 1.0, 1.6**  
- 0.25 < 1.0 < 1.6, so this **is** in order from least to greatest.

**Option H: 1.0, 0.25, 1.6**  
- 1.0 > 0.25, and 0.25 < 1.6, but 1.0 < 1.6, so this is **not** in order.

From the analysis, only **Option G** is in the correct order from least to greatest.
