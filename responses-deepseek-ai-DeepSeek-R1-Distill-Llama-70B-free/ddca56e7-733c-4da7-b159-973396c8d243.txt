Okay, so I have this question about the genetic basis of Down's syndrome. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that Down's syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality. Chromosomes are these thread-like structures in the nucleus, right? Humans have 23 pairs, making 46 in total. Each pair has two chromosomes, one from each parent.

Wait, I think Down's syndrome has something to do with an extra chromosome. Oh right, it's trisomy something. Trisomy means having three copies of a chromosome instead of the usual two. So which chromosome is involved here?

I recall that it's either chromosome 21, 18, 13, but wait, those are for different syndromes. Like, 18 is Edwards syndrome, and 13 is Patau. So Down's must be 21. So it's trisomy 21.

Looking at the options, option I is trisomy of chromosome 21. That makes sense. But let me check other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Option A: Duplication of 14. No, duplication is when a part is copied, but Down's is a whole extra chromosome. So that's probably wrong.

Option B: Translocation between 14 and 21. Translocation is when a part of one chromosome breaks off and attaches to another. I think some cases of Down's are due to translocations, but the most common cause is having an extra chromosome 21. So B might be a possibility, but not the main one.

Option C: Deletion in 21. Deletion would mean missing a part, which is different. Down's is having an extra, not missing.

Option D: Mutation in 14. Mutation is a change in the DNA sequence, which is different from having an extra chromosome.

Option E: Duplication of 18. That's more like Edwards syndrome, I think.

Option F: Deletion in 14. No, that's probably a different condition.

Option G: Inversion in 21. Inversion is when a chromosome breaks, flips, and reattaches. That's a structural change but doesn't add an extra chromosome.

Option H: Duplication of 21. Duplication could mean an extra copy, but technically, having a whole extra chromosome is trisomy, not duplication. Wait, duplication usually refers to a part of the chromosome being copied, not the entire chromosome. So trisomy is the right term here.

Option J: Mutation in 21. Again, a mutation is a change, not an extra copy.

So the correct answer should be I: Trisomy of chromosome 21.

The genetic basis of Down's syndrome is trisomy 21, where an individual has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two. This condition arises due to nondisjunction during meiosis, resulting in an extra chromosome. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

I: Trisomy of chromosome 21.

Answer: I
