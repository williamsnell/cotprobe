Okay, so I've got this tort law question to tackle, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully and understanding the scenario.

The situation is about a husband and wife shopping at a department store. The wife, who weighs over 300 pounds, couldn't find a dress in her size. She approached a store clerk and asked if they carried the dress in her size. The clerk responded by saying she looked like a hippopotamus and that they didn't have the dress in the "hippo size." Another customer overheard this and started laughing. The wife became upset and left the store. Now, she's considering a tort action against the department store based on the clerk's actions.

The question is asking what the outcome would be if she files this tort claim. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should recall the relevant torts that could apply here. The scenario describes a situation where someone made an offensive comment that caused emotional distress. So, I'm thinking this might relate to intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) or perhaps defamation. But I'm more inclined towards IIED here because defamation usually involves false statements that harm someone's reputation, and it's not clear if the clerk's statement was false or just offensive.

Intentional infliction of emotional distress requires four elements: (1) the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly; (2) the conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) the actions caused emotional distress; and (4) the distress was severe.

Let's break it down with the given facts. The clerk made a comment comparing the wife to a hippopotamus and referred to her size in a derogatory way. This was done in front of another customer, which likely added to the humiliation. The wife became very upset, which suggests emotional distress.

Now, looking at the elements:

1. Intentional or Reckless: The clerk's comment seems intentional. They directly addressed the wife and made the offensive remark, so it's likely intentional.

2. Extreme and Outrageous: This is a high bar. Courts usually require conduct that's beyond the bounds of decency. Comparing someone to a hippopotamus in a mocking way could be seen as extreme, especially given the context of the wife's weight and her inability to find clothes. It's humiliating and could meet this standard.

3. Causation: The wife became very upset and left the store, which indicates that the clerk's words caused her emotional distress.

4. Severe Distress: This is sometimes the tricky part. The wife was very upset, but does that rise to the level of severe? Severe emotional distress can include things like depression, anxiety, etc. But sometimes, in cases of public humiliation, courts have found that the distress is severe enough, especially if there are physical manifestations or if the conduct was particularly egregious.

I should also consider whether the store can be held liable for the clerk's actions. Under respondeat superior, employers are liable for the torts committed by employees within the scope of their employment. The clerk was acting in the scope of their job when interacting with a customer about available sizes. So the store would likely be vicariously liable if the clerk's actions constitute IIED.

Now, looking at the answer choices:

Option B says she'll win because the clerk's conduct was extreme and outrageous. That aligns with the IIED analysis. Option C says she'll win because the clerk's actions caused emotional distress, which is also part of IIED but only one elementâ€”so it's not sufficient on its own. Option F says she'll win because the comment intended to ridicule, which ties into intent but again, it's one part of the analysis.

Option D says she'll lose because she didn't suffer physical harm. But IIED doesn't require physical harm, so D is incorrect. Option E says the clerk was stating an opinion, but opinions can still be extreme and outrageous, so E might not hold. Option I says she only suffered hurt feelings, which isn't sufficient for IIED, but here the distress might be more severe than that.

Option H says she'll lose because the comment wasn't intended to cause harm. But the clerk's intent was to mock, so that's not the case. Option G is about the comment being overheard, which adds to the humiliation but isn't solely determinative. Option J is about the comment being public, but again, that's a factor in the outrageousness, not a determining factor on its own.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should hinge on whether the clerk's conduct was extreme and outrageous, causing severe emotional distress. So option B seems correct because it addresses the extreme and outrageous conduct, which is a key element of IIED.

Wait, but some might argue whether the distress was severe enough. The question says she became "very upset," which is a bit vague. Courts sometimes require more than just upset, like physical symptoms or long-term effects. If the facts don't show more, maybe she doesn't meet that element. But given that the question is a multiple-choice and option B is present, I think the intended answer is B.

The question revolves around a tort claim arising from a store clerk's offensive comment to a customer, which caused her emotional distress. The key issue is whether the clerk's actions constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). To establish IIED, the plaintiff must show: (1) intentional or reckless conduct, (2) extreme and outrageous behavior, (3) causation, and (4) severe emotional distress.

The clerk's comment, comparing the wife to a hippopotamus and using the term "hippo size," was clearly intentional and directed at the wife. The comment was made in front of another customer, amplifying the humiliation. This conduct likely meets the standard of being "extreme and outrageous," as it was demeaning and beyond the bounds of decency. The wife's distress, while described as making her "very upset," could be interpreted as severe given the context of public humiliation.

The department store can be held liable under respondeat superior, as the clerk was acting within the scope of employment. Among the answer choices, option B correctly identifies that the clerk's conduct was extreme and outrageous, satisfying a key element of IIED. Other options either focus on insufficient elements (e.g., physical harm in option D) or mischaracterize the situation (e.g., the comment as merely an opinion in option E). Therefore, the wife would likely succeed in her claim.
