Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what it's asking. The question is about calculating the income velocity of money. Hmm, I remember that velocity of money has something to do with how often money is used in the economy. 

Wait, the formula comes to mind. I think the income velocity of money is calculated by dividing the Gross National Product (GNP) by the money supply. Oh right, it's Velocity = GNP / Money Supply. That makes sense because if the money supply is M and the GNP is Y, then V = Y/M. 

So the numbers given here are the 1964 GNP as $622 billion and the average money supply as $155 billion. Plugging those into the formula, I should divide 622 by 155. Let me do that calculation. 

Wait, 622 divided by 155. Let me see, 155 times 4 is 620. Oh, because 155 *4 = 620. So 622 is just 2 more than that. So 622/155 is 4 with a remainder of 2. To get the exact value, I can write it as 4 and 2/155. 

Calculating 2 divided by 155, well, 2/155 is approximately 0.0129. So 4.0129 times. Let me check the options provided. Looking at the choices: option C is 4.0129 times. That matches what I got. So the answer should be C. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The formula is straightforward, and the calculation seems right. Yeah, I'm pretty confident it's option C.

The income velocity of money is calculated using the formula: 

\[
\text{Velocity} = \frac{\text{GNP}}{\text{Money Supply}}
\]

Given that the 1964 GNP is $622 billion and the average money supply is $155 billion, substituting these values into the formula gives:

\[
\text{Velocity} = \frac{622}{155} \approx 4.0129 \text{ times}
\]

This matches option C.
