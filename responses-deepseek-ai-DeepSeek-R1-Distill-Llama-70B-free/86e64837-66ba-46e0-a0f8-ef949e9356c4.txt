The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

It is observed that the chemical transmission occurring at a synapse is unidirectional that is, the neurotransmitter always travels from thepresynapticaxon to the post-synaptic dendrite . Explain why.

Options:

A: Neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals traveling towards the dendrites only.
B: The receptors for neurotransmitters are only found on the axonal terminals.
C: The neurotransmitter is present in the axonal end of a neuron only.
D: The synaptic vesicle is present inside the dendrites of a neuron.
E: The axonal terminals do not possess the machinery to release neurotransmitters.
F: The neurotransmitter degrades immediately upon release and cannot travel to the axon.
G: The dendrites actively pump the neurotransmitter back to the axon after it has been received.
H: The neurotransmitter is present in the dendritic end of a neuron only.
I: The dendrites release a different neurotransmitter that negates the effect of the axonal neurotransmitter.
J: The neurotransmitter can travel in both directions.

Okay, so I have this question about why chemical transmission at a synapse is unidirectional. Hmm, I remember from biology class that synapses are the junctions between neurons. The transmission is from the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of another, right? But why can't it go the other way?

The question gives options from A to J. Let me think through each one.

Option A says neurotransmitter release is stimulated by electrical signals traveling towards the dendrites only. Wait, I thought electrical signals in the neuron move from dendrites to the cell body and then down the axon. Oh, but the release of neurotransmitters happens when an action potential reaches the axon terminals. So maybe A is incorrect because the signals are coming from the axon, not towards the dendrites.

Option B says receptors are only on axonal terminals. No, I recall that receptors are on the post-synaptic neuron, which is usually the dendrites. So B doesn't make sense because the receptors aren't on the axon terminals.

Option C claims the neurotransmitter is present only in the axonal end. That sounds right because I remember that the axon terminals have synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitters. The dendrites don't produce or store them, I think. So C could be correct.

Option D says synaptic vesicles are in dendrites. No, that's wrong. The vesicles are in the axon terminals, ready to release into the synaptic cleft.

Option E says axon terminals can't release neurotransmitters. That's definitely wrong because that's exactly what they do when an action potential arrives.

Option F says the neurotransmitter degrades immediately. No, it's released into the cleft and then binds to receptors. It doesn't degrade instantly; sometimes it's taken back up by the axon.

Option G suggests dendrites pump it back. I think that's more about reuptake, but that doesn't explain directionality. Plus, reuptake is about stopping the signal, not direction.

Option H says neurotransmitters are only in dendrites. No, that's the opposite of what I thought. Neurotransmitters are in the axon.

Option I says dendrites release a different neurotransmitter. That doesn't directly explain unidirection. Plus, each synapse's direction is specific, so maybe not relevant.

Option J says neurotransmitters can travel both ways. But that contradicts what the question states, so J is wrong.

So the main point is that neurotransmitters are stored in the axon terminals. So when an action potential arrives, it triggers release. The dendrites don't have the vesicles or the machinery to release the neurotransmitters. Therefore, C makes sense because the neurotransmitters are only present in the axon end.

The unidirectionality of chemical transmission at a synapse is due to the specific location of neurotransmitters and the machinery involved in their release. Neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles within the axonal terminals of the presynaptic neuron. When an action potential reaches the axon terminals, it triggers the release of these neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The dendrites of the postsynaptic neuron, which lack the necessary machinery and vesicles to produce or release neurotransmitters, can only receive the signal. This explains why transmission occurs exclusively from the presynaptic axon to the postsynaptic dendrite.

Answer: C
