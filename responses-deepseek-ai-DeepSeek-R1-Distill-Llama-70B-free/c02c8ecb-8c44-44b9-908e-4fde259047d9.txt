Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of gas laws and the kinetic theory. But I'll try to take it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the mean free path of argon gas becoming comparable to the diameter of a vessel. Hmm, I remember that the mean free path is the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions. When it's comparable to the vessel's diameter, the gas is probably in a regime where the container's size affects the gas behavior significantly, maybe approaching the low-pressure limit where the ideal gas law starts to break down.

Alright, so the vessel has a volume of 100 cm³. Wait, but the question is about the diameter. Oh, right, I need to find the diameter of the vessel. Assuming the vessel is spherical, which is a common shape for such problems. So the volume V is (4/3)πr³. But wait, volume is 100 cm³, so I can find the radius from that.

Wait, no, wait. 100 cm³ is 10^2 cm³. Let me convert that to meters because standard SI units are probably needed. 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 1 cm³ is (0.01 m)^3 = 1e-6 m³. So 100 cm³ is 100e-6 m³ = 1e-4 m³. Hmm, no, wait, 100 cm³ is 10^2 * (1e-2 m)^3 = 10^2 * 1e-6 m³ = 1e-4 m³. Yeah, that's right.

Assuming the vessel is a sphere, the volume is (4/3)πr³. So solving for r: r = [(3V)/(4π)]^(1/3). V is 1e-4 m³. Let me compute that. So 3*(1e-4) is 3e-4, divided by 4π is about 3e-4 / 12.566 ≈ 2.387e-5. Taking the cube root of that. Hmm, cube root of 2.387e-5. Let me see, 2.387e-5 is approximately (3e-2)^3, because (0.03)^3 is 2.7e-5. Wait, 0.03^3 is 2.7e-5, so 2.387e-5 is a bit less than that. So the cube root is about 0.0288 meters, which is 2.88 cm. So the diameter would be twice that, approximately 5.76 cm. So about 0.0576 meters in diameter.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have messed up units somewhere. Let me double-check. The volume is 100 cm³ = 0.1 liters = 0.0001 m³. So V = 1e-4 m³. So (3V)/(4π) = (3 * 1e-4) / (4 * π) ≈ (3e-4) / 12.566 ≈ 2.387e-5 m³. So the radius is the cube root of 2.387e-5 m³.

Cube root of 2.387e-5: Let me compute that. Let's say x³ = 2.387e-5. Let's find x.

I can compute cube roots numerically. 0.028^3 is 0.028 * 0.028 = 0.000784, times 0.028 ≈ 0.00002195, which is 2.195e-5. Hmm, that's a bit less than 2.387e-5. So maybe 0.029 m? 0.029^3 = (3e-2)^3 = 2.7e-5. That's larger than 2.387e-5. So the cube root is between 0.028 and 0.029. Let's approximate it as 0.0288 m, which is 2.88 cm. So diameter is 5.76 cm, which is 0.0576 meters. Okay.

So the mean free path (λ) should be comparable to this diameter, so λ ≈ 0.0576 m.

Wait, but I think the problem says "comparable", so maybe we can just set λ equal to that value and solve for pressure. That's probably the approach.

Now, the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, d is the collision diameter (also called σ, but wait, the problem gives σ as 0.36 nm². Wait, no, the collision cross-section is usually given as σ = π d², where d is the diameter of the molecule. So perhaps in the formula, it's λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d² * P) = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * σ * P), since σ = π d².

Wait, let me clarify. The mean free path formula is λ = (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) π d² P), where d is the diameter of the gas molecule. But sometimes, σ is given as the collision cross-section, which is π d². So substituting, λ = (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) σ P).

Yes, that makes sense because σ would be π d². So the formula becomes λ = (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) σ P). So that's the formula I should use.

Given that, I can plug in the values.

Given:
- λ is 0.0576 meters (comparable to the vessel's diameter)
- T is 20°C, which is 293.15 K
- σ is 0.36 nm². Wait, nm squared. So 0.36 nm² is 0.36e-18 m² (since 1 nm = 1e-9 m, so (1e-9 m)^2 = 1e-18 m²). So σ = 0.36e-18 m².

k_B is Boltzmann's constant, which is 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So plugging into the formula:

λ = (k_B * T) / (sqrt(2) * σ * P)

We need to solve for P.

Rearranging the formula:

P = (k_B * T) / (sqrt(2) * σ * λ )

Plugging the numbers in:

k_B = 1.38e-23 J/K
T = 293 K
sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142
σ = 0.36e-18 m²
λ = 0.0576 m

So compute numerator: 1.38e-23 * 293 ≈ 1.38e-23 * 3e2 = 4.14e-21, but let me compute it more accurately.

1.38e-23 * 293 = 1.38 * 293 = let's compute that.

1.38 * 200 = 276
1.38 * 93 = 128.34
Total 276 +128.34 = 404.34
So 404.34e-23 J·m² (wait, no, units would be J·m because in the numerator, k_b*T has units of J, and the denominator would have units of (unitless) * m² * Pa, but wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself).

Wait, let me clarify units to make sure.

But maybe I should just compute the numerical value first.

So numerator is 1.38e-23 * 293 = 4.0434e-21.

Denominator is sqrt(2) * σ * λ.

sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142

σ = 0.36e-18 m²

λ = 0.0576 m

So denominator is 1.4142 * 0.36e-18 * 0.0576.

Compute 0.36e-18 * 0.0576 first.

0.36 * 0.0576 = 0.020736

So that's 0.020736e-18 m³.

Multiply by 1.4142: 0.020736e-18 * 1.4142 ≈ 0.02933e-18 m³.

So denominator is 2.933e-20 m³.

So P = (4.0434e-21) / (2.933e-20) ) Pa.

Wait, because the denominator is in m³, and numerator is in J (which is kg·m²/s²). So let's see, units:

[k_B T] = J = kg·m²/s².

Denominator: sqrt(2) σ λ → (m^2) * m = m^3.

So units of P would be (kg m²/s²) / (m^3) ) = kg/(m·s²), which is Pa. Correct.

So P = (4.0434e-21) / (2.933e-20) ) ≈ ?

Let me compute 4.0434e-21 / 2.933e-20.

That's equal to (4.0434 / 29.33) ) * 1e-1.

Wait, 4.0434 / 29.33 ≈ 0.1379.

So 0.1379 * 0.1 = 0.01379 Pa.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 0.1 to 0.3 Pa, so 0.01379 Pa is 0.0138 Pa, which would be option I (0.125 Pa) is higher. Hmm, but wait maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait let me recheck my calculations.

Wait, numerator is 1.38e-23 * 293 = 1.38 * 293 = let's compute precisely.

293 * 1.38:

200 *1.38 = 276.0
90 *1.38 = 124.2
3 *1.38=4.14
Total: 276 +124.2=400.2 +4.14=404.34

So 404.34e-23 = 4.0434e-21.

Denominator: 1.4142 * 0.36e-18 * 0.0576.

Let me compute 0.36e-18 * 0.0576:

0.36 * 0.0576 = 0.020736 → 0.020736e-18.

Multiply by 1.4142 → 0.020736e-18 * 1.4142 ≈ 0.02933e-18 = 2.933e-20.

So denominator is 2.933e-20.

So P = 4.0434e-21 / 2.933e-20 = (4.0434 / 29.33) ) * 1e-1.

Wait, 4.0434 / 29.33 = approximately 0.1379.

So 0.1379 * 0.1 = 0.01379 Pa, which is about 0.0138 Pa.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest is I: 0.125 Pa, but that's 0.125, which is almost ten times higher.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the exponents? Let me check.

Wait, 1.38e-23 * 293 = 4.0434e-21? Because 1e-23 * 1e2 is 1e-21, yes.

Denominator: 1.4142 * 0.36e-18 * 0.0576 = 1.4142 * 0.36 * 0.0576e-18.

Wait, 0.36 * 0.0576 = 0.020736, correct.

Then 0.020736 * 1.4142 ≈ 0.02933, so 0.02933e-18 is 2.933e-20.

So 4.0434e-21 / 2.933e-20 = (4.0434 / 29.33) ) * (1e-21 / 1e-20) ) = (0.1379) * (0.1) ) = 0.01379 Pa.

But none of the options are 0.0138 Pa. The closest is option I (0.125 Pa), but that's much higher.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the diameter.

Wait, maybe I messed up the vessel's diameter. Let me recheck that part.

The vessel's volume is 100 cm³, which is 1e-4 m³.

Assuming it's a sphere, the radius is (3V/(4π))^(1/3).

V=1e-4 m³.

So (3 * 1e-4) / (4 * π) = (3e-4)/(12.566) ≈ 2.387e-5 m³.

Cube root of 2.387e-5 m³.

Wait, cube root of 2.387e-5.

Let me compute it more accurately.

The cube root of 2.387e-5 can be calculated:

Let me express it as 2.387e-5 = 2.387 x 10^-5.

The cube root of 2.387 is approx 1.33, because 1.3^3=2.197, 1.33^3= (1.3)^3 + 3*(1.3)^2*(0.03) + 3*(1.3)*(0.03)^2 + (0.03)^3 ≈ 2.197 + 0.1677 + 0.00441 + 0.000027 ≈ 2.369. Close to 2.387, so maybe around 1.332.

So cube root of 2.387e-5 is approximately 1.332e-2 m, which is 1.332 cm.

Wait, that's the radius. So diameter is 2.664 cm, which is 0.02664 meters.

Oh! Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Earlier, I thought the cube root was around 0.0288 m, but that's incorrect. Because 0.0288 m is 2.88 cm, but V is 1e-4 m³, which when calculating radius, should be smaller. Because 1e-4 m³ is 100 cm³, so a sphere of 100 cm³ is about 4.64 cm in radius (since (4/3)πr³=100 cm³ → r= (3*100/(4π))^(1/3) ). Let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, let me compute (3*100/(4π))^(1/3).

3*100 = 300.

300/(4π) ≈ 300/(12.566) ≈ 23.87 cm³.

So 23.87^(1/3). Hmm, cube root of 27 is 3, cube root of 23.87 is about 2.88 cm. Oh wait, but that's in cm. So radius is 2.88 cm, so diameter is 5.76 cm, which is 0.0576 m. Wait, but earlier I thought the cube root was 1.33e-2 m (1.33 cm) but that's not correct. So I think I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me correct this. I think I messed up the exponents.

Hold on, let's recompute the radius correctly.

V = 1e-4 m³ = 100 cm³.

Using V = (4/3)πr³ → r = [ (3V) / (4π) ]^(1/3).

So:

3V = 3 * 1e-4 = 3e-4 m³.

3e-4 / (4π) = (3e-4) / (12.566) ≈ 2.387e-5 m³.

So r = (2.387e-5)^(1/3).

Let me compute this accurately.

2.387e-5 m³ → 2.387e-5 = 2.387 x 10^-5.

Cube root of 2.387 is approximately 1.33 (since 1.33³≈2.35).

So cube root of 2.387e-5 m³ is (2.387)^(1/3) * (1e-5)^(1/3) → 1.33 * (1e-5)^(1/3).

Wait, (1e-5) is 1e-5 m³. Wait, no, 1e-5 m³ would be (1e-5)^(1/3) = 1e-5^(1/3) m. Wait, 1e-5 is 10^-5, so cube root is 10^(-5/3) ≈ 10^(-1.6667) ≈ 2.154e-2 m, which is 2.154 cm.

So 1.33 * 2.154 cm ≈ 2.86 cm. So radius is about 2.86 cm, diameter is 5.72 cm → 0.0572 m.

Ah, so earlier calculation of 0.0576 m was correct. So λ is 0.0572 m.

Hmm, so that's correct.

So going back to the pressure calculation.

Wait, in the initial calculation, I got P ≈ 0.01379 Pa, but the options don't have that. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me double-check the mean free path formula.

The formula is λ = (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) π d² P), where d is the diameter of the molecule. But wait, sometimes the formula uses σ = π d², the collision cross-section. So with that substitution, λ = (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) σ P).

Yes, that's correct.

So using that, P = (k_B T) / (sqrt(2) σ λ )

Plugging in the numbers:

k_B = 1.38e-23 J/K

T = 293 K

sqrt(2)=1.4142

σ=0.36e-18 m²

λ=0.0572 m

So numerator:
