Question:

The percentage of successful single pairmatingsobserved forone hour in Drosophilamelanogastercultures showed thefollowing: Matings Before crossing wild stock with yellow stock for 7generations After crossing wild stock with yellow stock for 7generations WT male × WT female 62 75 Yellow male × WT female 34 47 WT male × yellow female 87 81 Yellow male × yellow female 78 59 Yellow is a recessive mutant strain of flies that is phenotypicallyexpressed as a yellow rather than gray body. Explain how this mutation affects the mating behavior of D.melanogaster.

Options:

A: Wild-type females are less successful in mating with yellow males.

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about Drosophila melanogaster mating behavior and how a yellow mutation affects it. Hmm, I remember that in fruit flies, mating behaviors can be influenced by various factors, including genetic mutations.

The question gives a table with percentages of successful single pair matings observed for one hour. There are four types of matings before and after crossing wild stock with yellow stock for seven generations. The matings are between different combinations of wild-type (WT) and yellow males and females.

Wait, WT is wild-type, which I think is the standard gray body color. The yellow is a recessive mutant, so only those homozygous for the mutation (e.g., yellow/yellow) would show the yellow phenotype.

Looking at the data, let me compare the before and after results.

Before crossing:
- WT male × WT female: 62%
- Yellow male × WT female: 34%
- WT male × yellow female: 87%
- Yellow male × yellow female: 78%

After 7 generations of crossing:
- WT × WT: 75% (increased from 62%)
- Yellow × WT: 47% (up from 34%)
- WT × yellow: 81% (down from 87%)
- Yellow × yellow: 59% (down from 78%)

So, what changes? It looks like in the after scenario, some matings are more successful, others less. But I'm supposed to figure out how the yellow mutation affects mating behavior.

I remember that in fruit flies, mating success can be influenced by various factors like pheromones, courtship behavior, and possibly visual cues. Since yellow is a body color mutation, maybe it affects how flies perceive each other.

Looking at the data, in the before crossing:

Yellow male with WT female has 34% success. WT male with yellow female has 87%. So WT males seem more successful when paired with yellow females. But when both are yellow, it's 78%. 

After crossing, the yellow male with WT female goes up to 47%, which is an increase but still lower than WT males with WT females (75%). The WT male with yellow female drops to 81%, which is still high. Yellow male with yellow female drops to 59%.

So what's the pattern here? It seems that in the before case, WT males have higher success with yellow females than yellow males do with WT females. After crossing, the success rates change, but perhaps this indicates some assortative mating or other behaviors.

Wait, the question says that the wild stock was crossed with yellow stock for seven generations. So perhaps this leads to changes in the population's behavior or genetics that influence mating success.

I think the key here is that the yellow mutation affects the flies' mating behavior, perhaps making yellow males less successful in mating with WT females. Because in the before data, yellow males have lower success with WT females (34%) compared to WT males, which have 62% with WT females and 87% with yellow females.

So when a yellow male tries to mate with a WT female, they're less successful. Maybe because the WT females prefer WT males over yellow ones. Alternatively, the yellow males might not perform the courtship rituals as effectively.

Looking at the options:

Option B says that yellow males are less successful in mating with WT females than WT males. That seems to fit. Because in the before data, yellow male × WT female is 34%, while WT male × WT female is 62%, and WT male × yellow female is 87%. So indeed, yellow males aren't as successful with WT females as WT males are.

Option A says wild-type females are less successful with yellow males. Well, the data shows that when WT females are paired with yellow males, their success is lower (34% before, 47% after). So maybe that's because the females don't prefer them, but the option says they're less successful, which is correct but perhaps the reason is more about male behavior.

Option B specifically points out that yellow males are less successful, which seems to be the case.

Option C suggests yellow females prefer yellow males. But their success rate before was 78%, which is pretty high, but after it drops. Not sure if that's about preference or something else.

Option D says WT males preferentially mate with yellow females. Before, WT males had high success with yellow females (87%), but after, it's 81%, which is still high. But the question is about the mutation's effect. So if WT males are better at mating with yellow females, maybe the mutation makes yellow females more attractive? Or perhaps the yellow mutation doesn't affect female behavior but makes males less attractive.

Wait, but the mutation is in the male's color as well. So if a male is yellow, maybe he's less attractive to WT females. Alternatively, maybe the mutation affects pheromones or courtship behavior.

In the data, before crossing, yellow male × WT female had low success. So perhaps the yellow males don't court as effectively, leading to lower mating success with WT females.

So the mutation (being yellow) makes the males less successful in mating with WT females. So option B.

Other options don't seem to fit. Option E says WT males are less successful with yellow females, which isn't the case because before, WT males had 87% success with yellow females, which is higher than their success with WT females (62%). So E is incorrect.

Option G says the mutation doesn't affect behavior, which doesn't fit the data because the success rates change based on genotype.

So I think the correct answer is B.

The question examines how the yellow mutation affects mating behavior in *Drosophila melanogaster*. The data provided shows the percentage of successful single pair matings for different combinations of wild-type (WT) and yellow males and females, before and after crossing wild stock with yellow stock for seven generations. The key observations are:

1. **Before crossing**:
   - WT male × WT female: 62%
   - Yellow male × WT female: 34%
   - WT male × yellow female: 87%
   - Yellow male × yellow female: 78%

2. **After crossing**:
   - WT male × WT female: 75% (increased from 62%)
   - Yellow male × WT female: 47% (increased from 34%)
   - WT male × yellow female: 81% (decreased from 87%)
   - Yellow male × yellow female: 59% (decreased from 78%)

From this data, it is evident that yellow males are less successful in mating with WT females compared to WT males. For example, before crossing, yellow males had only 34% success with WT females, while WT males achieved 62% success with WT females and 87% success with yellow females. This suggests that the yellow mutation makes males less attractive or effective in mating with WT females, possibly due to differences in courtship behavior or pheromones.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. While WT females have lower success rates with yellow males, the data suggests this is due to the yellow males' reduced effectiveness rather than the females' behavior.
- **Option B**: Correct. The data clearly shows that yellow males are less successful in mating with WT females compared to WT males.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. There is no evidence that yellow females prefer yellow males; the success rates for yellow male × yellow female matings are not consistently higher than other combinations.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. While WT males have high success rates with yellow females, this does not indicate preferential mating but rather the effectiveness of WT males.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. WT males are highly successful with yellow females, as shown by the 87% success rate before crossing.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. There is no evidence that the yellow mutation increases aggression in males.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The data clearly shows that the yellow mutation affects mating behavior, as success rates vary depending on the genotypes of the flies.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The yellow mutation does not enhance attractiveness; it appears to reduce the success of yellow males with WT females.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The mutation does not increase overall mating success; some combinations show reduced success.

The most consistent explanation is that the yellow mutation makes males less successful in mating with WT females, as stated in **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
