Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the history of biology, specifically dealing with the idea that species are fixed and unchanging. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my history here, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which group is entirely composed of individuals who maintained that species are fixed. So I need to figure out which historical figures believed in the fixity of species.

Let me start by recalling each of these scientists and their contributions. 

First, Aristotle. From what I remember, Aristotle was a Greek philosopher who contributed a lot to various fields, including biology. I think he believed in a hierarchy of life forms, maybe something like the scala naturae, where organisms were arranged in a fixed ladder. So he probably thought species don't change, right?

Then there's Linnaeus. Carolus Linnaeus is known for his work in taxonomy, classifying organisms. I believe he thought species were fixed because he was creating a system to categorize them, implying that they don't change over time. So Linnaeus likely supported the idea of fixed species.

Cuvier comes next. Georges Cuvier was a French naturalist and is considered the father of comparative anatomy. I think he proposed catastrophism, which suggested that the Earth's features are due to sudden changes like floods. He also believed in the fixity of species, so new species were created after each catastrophe. So Cuvier supports fixed species.

Now, Lamarck. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck is known for his theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, like the idea that giraffes stretch their necks and pass it on. His theory was a form of evolution, so he definitely didn't believe in fixed species. He thought species change over time through use or disuse of traits.

Darwin is next. Charles Darwin is the father of evolutionary theory. His work, especially "On the Origin of Species," clearly shows that species change over time through natural selection. So Darwin didn't believe in fixed species either.

Lyell, Charles Lyell, was a geologist. I remember he was a proponent of uniformitarianism, which is the idea that the Earth's features are shaped by gradual processes over a long time. But in terms of biology, I think Lyell was against the idea of evolution. Wait, no, Lyell's work influenced Darwin, but Lyell himself didn't accept evolution as much. But wait, did he believe in fixed species? Or was he more about geological changes? I'm a bit confused here. I think Lyell was a gradualist in geology but maybe not in biology. So perhaps he thought species were fixed because he didn't accept the idea of transmutation of species. Or maybe he did? Wait, no, I think he was more about the Earth's structure and not so much about biological evolution. So maybe his views on species fixity are separate. Alternatively, perhaps Lyell was against the fixity, but I'm not sure. I'll have to think.

So the question is about groups composed entirely of those who maintained species are fixed. So looking at the options, I need a group where all three individuals believed species don't change.

Let me look at the options:

Option C: Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier.

From my earlier thoughts, all three of these supported fixed species. Aristotle with his scala naturae, Linnaeus with taxonomy implying fixity, and Cuvier with his catastrophism believing in fixed species that are replaced after catastrophes.

Other options may include people who don't fit. For example, option A includes Darwin, who definitely doesn't fit. Option B includes Darwin as well. Option D includes Lamarck, who doesn't fit. Option E, F, G, H, I, J all include either Lamarck or Darwin or both, so they can't be entirely fixed-species supporters.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To determine which group is composed entirely of individuals who maintained that species are fixed (i.e., unchanging), we need to analyze the beliefs of each historical figure mentioned:

1. **Aristotle**: Believed in a hierarchy of life forms (scala naturae), implying species are fixed and unchanging.  
2. **Linnaeus**: Known for taxonomy and classifying organisms, which suggests he viewed species as fixed entities.  
3. **Cuvier**: A proponent of catastrophism, he believed species were fixed and replaced after catastrophic events.  
4. **Lamarck**: Proposed the theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, which involves species changing over time, so he did not believe in fixed species.  
5. **Darwin**: The father of evolutionary theory, he clearly demonstrated that species change over time through natural selection.  
6. **Lyell**: While a gradualist in geology (uniformitarianism), his views on biological evolution are less clear, but he likely did not fully accept the idea of species changing over time.

Given this analysis, the only group where all individuals maintained that species are fixed is **Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier**. Other options include individuals like Lamarck or Darwin, who did not support the fixity of species.
