Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Jainism, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read the question again: "Which Jaina group only allows women to lead a life of semi-renunciation?" The options are A through J, with various terms I've heard before but need to think through.

First, I remember that Jainism has two main sects: Digambara and Svetambara. I think the question is about one of these or maybe a subgroup. The key here is semi-renunciation, which I believe refers to a state where someone dedicates themselves to religious life but not as fully as a monk or nun. So, maybe it's about laypeople or a specific order.

Wait, semi-renunciation... Oh right, in Jainism, there are different levels of renunciation. Monks and nuns are fully renounced, while laypeople can take vows but live at home. But the question is about a group that only allows women to do this semi-renunciation. Hmm.

I think the Svetambara sect is more liberal, allowing both men and women to become nuns. But the Digambara sect doesn't allow women to become nuns at all, believing that only men can achieve liberation. So if Digambara doesn't allow women to be nuns, maybe they have some semi-renunciate status?

Alternatively, I've heard of the Terapanthi sect, which is a subgroup within Svetambara. Terapanthi is known for having a more organized monastic order. Wait, do they have a special role for women in semi-renunciation? Or maybe another group.

Wait, I think the Yapaniya might be a subgroup too. Or perhaps the Murtipujaka is a Svetambara subgroup. Let me think: Murtipujaka is a sub-sect of Svetambara, but I don't recall their stance on women's roles.

Another option is the Terapanthi. I remember that Terapanthi has both male and female monks, but maybe they have a specific category for women. Or perhaps the question is referring to a group where women can only be semi-renunciates, meaning they can't become full nuns. 

Wait, the question says "only allows women to lead a life of semi-renunciation." So, in other words, women can't become full renunciates in this group. Which group is that? 

If the Digambara sect doesn't allow women to become nuns (full renunciation), then maybe they can only be laywomen or have some semi-renunciate status. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe a subgroup like the Yapaniya allows women to take certain vows but not become full monastics.

Alternatively, I've heard that in the Digambara tradition, women can't achieve liberation in their current form and must be reborn as men first. So perhaps in Digambara, women can only be semi-renunciates, not full nuns.

Wait, but the question is about a group that only allows women to do semi-renunciation. So if a group allows men to fully renounce but restricts women to semi-renunciation, that's the one.

Wait, another thought: The Svetambara tradition allows both men and women to become monks and nuns, so that's not it. The Digambara doesn't allow women to become nuns at all. So perhaps the group in question is the Digambara, but I'm not sure if they allow any form of semi-renunciation for women.

Alternatively, maybe it's another group. Let me think about the options again. The options are A: Murtipujaka, B: Digambara, C: Agama, D: Yapaniya, E: Jain Yoga, F: Terapanthi, G: Jina, H: Shramana, I: Svetambara, J: Tirthankara.

Wait, Shramana refers to the ascetic practitioners, so maybe not. Tirthankara are the liberated souls, so that's not a group. Agama refers to the scriptures, so that's not a group. Jina is another term for Tirthankara. Jain Yoga might be a practice, not a group.

So the possible groups are A, B, D, F, I. Murtipujaka and Yapaniya are subsects of Svetambara, I think. Terapanthi is another Svetambara subgroup.

Wait, I remember that among the Svetambara, the Terapanthi sect has a more organized structure. They have both male and female monastics. So maybe the group in question is not Terapanthi.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to break it down.

If the question is about a group where women can only be semi-renunciates, not full nuns, then the group must not allow women to become full nuns. 

In Digambara, women cannot become nuns at all. So they can't even be semi-renunciates? Or maybe they have a laywomen role, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in Digambara, the belief is that women cannot achieve liberation without being reborn as men. So they don't have an order of nuns. Laywomen can follow certain vows but can't become full renunciates. So perhaps the Digambara group only allows women to lead a life of semi-renunciation, like being laywomen with some vows, but not full nuns.

Alternatively, I'm not sure if semi-renunciation refers to a specific category. Maybe in some groups, there's a category between lay and monastic life, like a semi-monastic state.

Wait, another angle: the term 'semi-renunciation' in Jainism is sometimes referred to as the 'saman' or 'samaniji' category. I think in the Svetambara tradition, particularly in the Terapanthi sect, there are samaniji, who are female ascetics but not at the same level as nuns. Or maybe in the Digambara, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I think that the Yapaniya sect is a subgroup of Svetambara that allows women to become nuns. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, I think I might have read that the Sthanakavasi and Terapanthi are subsects of Svetambara. Sthanakavasi don't worship images, while Murtipujaka do. So Murtipujaka is a Svetambara subgroup that allows image worship.

But the question is about semi-renunciation. Another thought: the term "Anagarika" in Buddhism refers to a lay renunciate, someone who has taken vows but hasn't become a monk. Maybe Jainism has a similar concept, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, in some groups, women can take certain vows but cannot become full nuns. So, for example, in the Digambara sect, women cannot become nuns, but they can take some vows as laywomen, which might be considered a form of semi-renunciation.

So, if the group is Digambara (option B), their women can only be semi-renunciates because they can't become full nuns. But wait, the question says "only allows women to lead a life of semi-renunciation," which might imply that men can have full renunciation and women can't.

Yes, in Digambara, men can become monks, but women cannot. So women can only take on a semi-renunciate role, if any. So the group would be Digambara.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that in Digambara, women can't even be semi-renunciates, but perhaps they can be laywomen with certain vows.

Alternatively, another possibility is the Terapanthi sect. Wait, no, Terapanthi allows women to become nuns. So that's not it.

Wait, another angle: the question specifies that only women can lead a life of semi-renunciation. So perhaps in this group, men can't be semi-renunciates, but women can. But I don't think that's the case in any group I know of.

Alternatively, perhaps the group is the Svetambara, but that doesn't fit because Svetambara allows women to become full nuns.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of each option again.

Option B is Digambara: In Digambara, women cannot become nuns. So if they can't become full nuns, maybe their only option is semi-renunciation. So this group would only allow women to do semi-renunciation, while men can become full monks. So the answer would be B: Digambara.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D: Yapaniya. I'm not sure about Yapaniya's stance on women.

Another thought: There's a group called the Ajivika, but that's a different religion, not Jain. So not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps it's the Murtipujaka. But I think Murtipujaka is a Svetambara subgroup that allows image worship, and they do allow nuns, so that's not it.

So, putting it together, I think the answer is B: Digambara.

The question asks which Jaina group only allows women to lead a life of semi-renunciation. To answer this, it is important to analyze the key Jain sects and their stance on women's roles in renunciation.

1. **Digambara (Option B):** The Digambara sect does not allow women to become full nuns, believing that women cannot achieve liberation in their current form and must be reborn as men first. Women in this sect can only take on a semi-renunciate role, such as laywomen with certain vows, but cannot become full renunciates. This aligns with the question's requirement of a group that only allows women to lead a life of semi-renunciation.

2. **Svetambara (Option I):** The Svetambara sect, in contrast, allows both men and women to become full monks and nuns. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria of the question.

3. **Terapanthi (Option F):** A subgroup of Svetambara, the Terapanthi sect also allows both men and women to become full monastics, so it is not the correct answer.

4. **Other Options (A, C, D, E, G, H, J):** These include terms that are either subgroups, scriptural references, or general concepts within Jainism, but none specifically fit the description of a group that only allows women to lead a life of semi-renunciation.

Based on this analysis, the Digambara sect is the correct answer, as it restricts women to semi-renunciation while allowing men to pursue full renunciation.
