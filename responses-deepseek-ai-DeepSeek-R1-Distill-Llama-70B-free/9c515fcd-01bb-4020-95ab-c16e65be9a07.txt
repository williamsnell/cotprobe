The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

An employee is an orthodox member of his faith. He has recently been hired as a forest ranger by the state. In accordance with the orthodox tradition of his religion, the employee wears a covering on his head throughout the day. The director of the state forestry department has notified the employee that he will not be permitted to wear his head covering while on duty. A state forestry regulation provides that all forest rangers are required to wear only standard headgear in the interests of maintaining a uniform dress code conducive to the furtherance of the department's morale, efficiency, and professional standard of conduct. Although the employee wants to pursue a career as a forest ranger, he feels that his religious beliefs should not be compromised by a governmental agency. In trying to resolve his dilemma, the employee seeks your legal advice. You should advise him that in light of relevant U. S. Supreme Court decisions, the state regulation is probably

Options:

A: constitutional, because the state has a legitimate interest in ensuring the safety of its employees, and the headgear could potentially pose a safety risk.
B: unconstitutional, because the state's interest in maintaining a dress code does not outweigh the employee's right to freely exercise his religion.
C: unconstitutional, because in accordance with the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, a state has no power to regulate religious beliefs.
D: constitutional, because the interest of the state in vindicating a carefully considered professional judgment by the forestry director that wearing such religious apparel would interfere with the department's morale and efficiency is sufficient to contravene the wishes of its members to wear headgear required by their religious beliefs.
E: constitutional, because the regulation is neutral and generally applicable, and it does not target specific religions or religious practices.
F: constitutional, because the state has a compelling interest in maintaining uniformity and professionalism among its employees.
G: unconstitutional, because the state has failed to provide a less restrictive means of achieving its stated interest.
H: constitutional, because although the employee has a constitutional right to the free exercise of his religion, a state may impose reasonable regulations that are rationally related to the furtherance of a state interest.
I: unconstitutional, because an individual has a fundamental right to seek gainful employment, and a state cannot arbitrarily and unreasonably regulate against such economic activity.

Alright, so I've got this legal question here about an employee's religious head covering and a state regulation. Let me try to break this down step by step. Okay, the employee is an orthodox member of his faith, which requires him to wear a head covering throughout the day. He's been hired as a forest ranger, but the director says he can't wear it on duty. The state regulation says all rangers must wear only standard headgear to maintain uniform dress code, which they believe is good for morale, efficiency, and professional standards.

The question is asking whether this regulation is constitutional, based on U.S. Supreme Court decisions. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause is involved here. The Clause prohibits the government from making laws that prohibit the free exercise of religion. But the Supreme Court has interpreted this in various ways over time.

Wait, there was a big case called Employment Division v. Smith, right? In that case, the Court held that if a law is neutral and generally applicable, it doesn't violate the Free Exercise Clause, even if it burdens someone's religious practice. So, for example, if a state law against peyote use applies to everyone, the Court said that the state doesn't have to exempt someone for religious use, unless the law specifically targets religion.

In this question, the state regulation is about a uniform dress code. It's a neutral rule applied to all forest rangers, not targeting any specific religion. So under Smith, the state doesn't need to make an exception unless they can prove a compelling interest, but wait, no, Smith actually says that the government doesn't need to have a compelling interest if the law is neutral and generally applicable. So the burden on religion is allowed as long as the law isn't targeting religion.

So the employee here wants to wear his headgear, but the state says no because of the uniform. The regulation doesn't mention religion, it's just about standard headgear. So it's a neutral, generally applicable law. According to Smith, the state doesn't need to accommodate his religious practice unless the law is specifically targeting religion, which it's not here.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option E says the regulation is constitutional because it's neutral and generally applicable. That sounds like it matches the Smith case reasoning. Option B says it's unconstitutional because the state's interest doesn't outweigh religious rights, but under Smith, the state doesn't have to outweigh if the law is neutral and generally applicable.

Option D talks about the director's judgment on morale and efficiency being sufficient. But the Smith case doesn't require the state to prove a compelling interest if the law is neutral. So D might be mixing up the standard.

Option A mentions safety, but the question doesn't state that the headgear poses a safety risk. The regulation is about uniformity, not safety. So A might not be the right choice.

Option F says the state has a compelling interest in uniformity and professionalism. But again, under Smith, they don't need a compelling interest if the law is neutral.

Option G says the state failed to provide a less restrictive means. But Smith doesn't require that in neutral laws; that's more for cases where the law isn't neutral, and strict scrutiny applies.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be E. The regulation is constitutional because it's neutral and generally applicable, so it doesn't violate the Free Exercise Clause under the Smith precedent.

The question revolves around whether a state regulation prohibiting a forest ranger from wearing religious headgear on duty is constitutional under the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause. The regulation mandates standard headgear for all forest rangers to maintain uniformity, morale, efficiency, and professional standards. The employee, an orthodox member of his faith, believes his religious practice should not be compromised by the state.

The key legal precedent here is **Employment Division v. Smith**, where the Supreme Court ruled that neutral, generally applicable laws do not violate the Free Exercise Clause, even if they burden religious practices. The state does not need to demonstrate a compelling interest or provide religious exemptions if the law is neutral and applies to everyone equally.

In this case, the regulation is neutral and generally applicable, as it does not target any specific religion or religious practice. It simply requires standard headgear for all employees. Therefore, under the **Smith** precedent, the regulation is constitutional because it meets the criteria of being neutral and generally applicable, without requiring further justification from the state.

Option E correctly reflects this reasoning, stating that the regulation is constitutional because it is neutral and generally applicable, and does not target specific religions or practices.

**Answer: E**
