Okay, so I've got this question about autonomic conditioning, and I need to figure out the correct answer from the options given. Let me start by breaking down what I know and what each option is saying.

First, what is autonomic conditioning? I remember that the autonomic nervous system (ANS) controls involuntary functions of the body, like heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, etc. So, autonomic conditioning must have something to do with training or influencing these involuntary responses.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's a method of cognitive behavioral therapy targeting conscious thought patterns. Hmm, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is about changing thought patterns and behaviors, but I don't think it's specifically about the autonomic functions. CBT deals more with the conscious mind, so this might not be the right fit.

Option B is about voluntary control of muscles. Voluntary muscles are controlled by the somatic nervous system, not the autonomic. So this doesn't seem right either.

Option C mentions learning new behaviors. That's a bit vague. While learning can involve various types of conditioning, I'm not sure if this directly ties to the autonomic system specifically.

Option D talks about dietary changes to enhance ANS function. I haven't heard of autonomic conditioning being related to diet. It sounds more like a lifestyle or nutritional approach rather than a conditioning method.

Option E is physical training. Physical training can affect the ANS, like exercise improving heart rate variability, but I'm not sure if that's what autonomic conditioning refers to specifically. It might be a broader concept.

Option F is about high-altitude acclimatization. The body does adapt to high altitudes, which involves physiological changes, but I don't recall this being called autonomic conditioning. It's more about environmental adaptation.

Option G relates to memory formation. Memory involves the brain, particularly the hippocampus and other areas, but I don't see a direct link to the autonomic nervous system's conditioning here.

Option H says it's operant conditioning of autonomic responses like heart rate and intestinal contractions. Operant conditioning is a type of learning where behavior is modified by its consequences. If autonomic responses can be voluntarily controlled through such conditioning, this makes sense. I think there's something called biofeedback, which involves becoming aware of and controlling physiological functions, which might align with this.

Wait, biofeedback is a technique where people learn to control involuntary actions. So, if autonomic conditioning is about learning to control these involuntary responses through some form of training or conditioning, then option H fits because it mentions operant conditioning of autonomic responses.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be H.

Autonomic conditioning refers to the operant conditioning of autonomic responses such as heart rate and intestinal contractions. This process involves learning to control involuntary functions through specific techniques or training. 

Answer: H
