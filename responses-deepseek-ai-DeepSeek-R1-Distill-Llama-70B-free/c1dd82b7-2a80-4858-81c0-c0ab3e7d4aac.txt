Okay, I need to find the pressure of carbon dioxide (CO₂) at 200°F and a specific volume of 0.20 ft³/lbm. Hmm, I remember that for determining properties like pressure, we often use thermodynamic tables or equations of state. Since I don't have the exact tables in front of me, I'll try to think through this logically.

Wait, CO₂ has a critical point that's important. I think the critical temperature for CO₂ is around 31°C (which is approximately 88°F) and the critical pressure is about 73 bar or 1070 psi. Since our temperature here is 200°F, which is way above the critical temperature, CO₂ should be in the supercritical fluid region. But wait, wait, no, wait. At temperatures above the critical temperature, the substance can't be liquefied no matter the pressure, so it's a gas. But wait, CO₂ is a gas at room temperature and pressure, but under high pressure and lower temperatures, it becomes a liquid or supercritical fluid.

Wait, 200°F is higher than the critical temperature of CO₂, which is about 88°F. So above that, CO₂ is a gas regardless of pressure. So in this case, we can treat it as an ideal gas? Or maybe not, because at high pressures, gases tend to deviate from ideal behavior.

But wait, the specific volume given is 0.20 ft³/lbm. Let me think about typical specific volumes. For ideal gases, at atmospheric pressure, specific volumes are much higher. For example, at standard conditions, the specific volume of CO₂ is much larger than 0.2, so perhaps 0.2 is a relatively high pressure. So maybe it's in a region where the ideal gas law isn't accurate enough.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the ideal gas law to get an estimate and then see if the options make sense. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But here, we're dealing with specific volume, which is the volume per unit mass (v = V/m). So, the specific gas constant (R) for CO₂ would be needed.

I think the specific gas constant R for CO₂ is around 35.1 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R). Wait, let me double-check. The universal gas constant R is 10.73 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R). Wait, no, the specific gas constant for CO₂ is calculated as R_specific = R_universal / M, where M is the molecular weight. CO₂ has a molecular weight of about 44.01 lbm/lbmol. So R_specific = 10.73 / 44.01 ≈ 0.2436 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R). Hmm, that seems low. Wait, maybe I mixed up units. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the ideal gas equation in specific terms is P * v = R * T, where R is the specific gas constant. So P (psi) * v (ft³/lbm) = R (psi·ft³/(lbm·°R)) * T (°R).

So R for CO₂ is 35.1 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R)? Or was that another gas? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with other gases like air or something else. Let me think. Oh wait, for air, R is about 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbm·°R), but in different units, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the conversion from specific gas constant. The molecular weight M of CO₂ is 44.01. The universal gas constant R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·°R). So the specific gas constant R_specific is R / M = 10.7316 / 44.01 ≈ 0.2437 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R).

So, T is given as 200°F. Converting to Rankine: T = 200 + 459.67 = 659.67 °R.

So plugging into the ideal gas equation: P = (R_specific * T) / v.

P = (0.2437 psi·ft³/(lbm·°R) * 659.67 °R) / 0.20 ft³/lbm.

Calculating numerator: 0.2437 * 659.67 ≈ 0.2437 * 660 ≈ 160.7 psi·ft³/lbm.

Divide by 0.20 ft³/lbm: 160.7 / 0.2 = 803.5 psi.

So approximately 800 psi. Looking at the options, G is 800 psia. So the answer would be G.

But wait, earlier I thought that at high pressures, the gas might not behave ideally, but the calculated value is right around one of the options. So probably, the correct answer is G: 800 psia.

To determine the pressure of carbon dioxide (CO₂) at 200°F and a specific volume of 0.20 ft³/lbm, we can use the ideal gas law in its specific form:

\[
P \cdot v = R \cdot T
\]

Where:  
- \(P\) is the pressure in psi,  
- \(v\) is the specific volume in ft³/lbm,  
- \(R\) is the specific gas constant for CO₂, and  
- \(T\) is the temperature in °R.  

### Step 1: Convert temperature to Rankine
The temperature is given as 200°F. Converting to Rankine:  
\[
T = 200 + 459.67 = 659.67 \, \text{°R}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the specific gas constant for CO₂
The molecular weight of CO₂ is approximately 44.01 lbm/lbmol. The universal gas constant is \(R_{\text{universal}} = 10.7316 \, \text{psi·ft³/(lbmol·°R)}\). The specific gas constant is calculated as:  
\[
R_{\text{specific}} = \frac{R_{\text{universal}}}{M} = \frac{10.7316}{44.01} \approx 0.2437 \, \text{psi·ft³/(lbm·°R)}.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for pressure
Using the ideal gas equation:  
\[
P = \frac{R_{\text{specific}} \cdot T}{v}.
\]

Substitute the known values:  
\[
P = \frac{0.2437 \cdot 659.67}{0.20}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:  
\[
0.2437 \cdot 659.67 \approx 160.7 \, \text{psi·ft³/lbm}.
\]

Then divide by the specific volume:  
\[
P = \frac{160.7}{0.20} = 803.5 \, \text{psi}.
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated pressure is approximately 800 psia, which corresponds to option **G**.

### Final Answer:
G
