Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about which power, standing alone, cannot support federal law. The options are A through J, each representing a different power.

First, I need to understand what each of these powers entails. I remember from my studies that the U.S. federal government has various enumerated powers, which are specifically listed in the Constitution. These include things like the commerce power, taxing power, and others. But there are also some powers that are not directly listed but are implied, like the necessary and proper clause.

The question is asking which of these powers, when standing alone, can't support a federal law. So I need to figure out which powers are granted to the federal government and which are not, or maybe which ones are reserved to the states.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Defense power. I think the defense power is related to the federal government's ability to provide for the common defense, which is an enumerated power in the Constitution. So the federal government can definitely pass laws based on this power.

Option B: Treaty power. Treaties are part of the federal government's foreign affairs powers. The President negotiates treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate. So laws related to treaties would fall under federal authority.

Option C: Legislative power. The legislative power is granted to Congress, so obviously Congress can pass laws under this power. But wait, the question is about which power alone cannot support a law. Hmm, maybe this is a trick option. Because legislative power is the general ability to make laws, so any law would be based on this. But I'm not sure if this is the right way to think about it. The question is probably referring to specific powers like commerce, taxing, etc.

Option D: Executive power. The executive power is vested in the President. But can the President make laws? No, the executive branch enforces laws. So laws are passed by Congress, not the executive. So maybe executive power alone can't support a law because the executive can't legislate. But wait, the question is about supporting federal law, not who makes them. Hmm, maybe the executive power is about enforcing laws, not creating them. So perhaps if a law is based solely on executive power, that's not possible because laws are made by Congress.

Option E: Judicial power. The judicial power is the ability to interpret laws and decide cases. The judiciary can't make laws either; they can declare them unconstitutional. So a law can't be based on judicial power alone because the judiciary doesn't create laws.

Option F: Commerce power. The commerce clause is a big one. Congress can regulate interstate commerce, so laws based on this power are definitely valid.

Option G: Spending power. The federal government can spend money for the general welfare, so laws related to spending are supported by this power.

Option H: Necessary and proper power. Also known as the elastic clause, this allows Congress to make laws necessary to carry out their enumerated powers. So yes, this supports federal laws.

Option I: Taxing power. The power to tax is an enumerated power, so laws imposing taxes are valid.

Option J: Police power. Police power is the ability to regulate for the health, safety, and welfare of the people. But wait, isn't police power a state power? Yes, I remember that the states have the police power under their general sovereignty, unless it's something the federal government is also involved in through other powers like commerce. So if a law is based solely on police power, the federal government can't do that because police power is reserved to the states.

Wait, but I thought the federal government can sometimes exercise police powers if it's tied to another enumerated power. Like, for example, regulating drugs under the commerce clause. So if a federal law is based solely on police power without another enumerated power, it wouldn't be valid. But if it's tied to another power, like commerce, then it's okay.

So looking back at the options, the question is which power alone can't support a federal law. So police power (option J) is a state power, so the federal government can't use it alone as the basis for a law. Therefore, the answer would be J.

But wait, what about option D and E? Executive and judicial powers. The executive can't make laws, only enforce them. The judicial can interpret but not create. So for a law to be made, it has to come from Congress under their legislative power. But the question is about which power can't support a law. So if a law is based solely on executive power, it can't exist because the executive doesn't make laws. Similarly for judicial power. But the options are about which power can't support a law when standing alone.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the concepts here. The powers listed are the sources of authority for the federal government to enact laws. So the executive and judicial powers are not lawmaking powers, they are powers of different branches. So for Congress to pass a law, it must be under one of their enumerated legislative powers, like commerce, taxing, etc. So if a law were to be based solely on executive power, that wouldn't be possible because the executive can't make laws.

But the options are about which power cannot support a law. So if the question is asking which power, when used alone, can't be the basis for a federal law, then police power (J) is the correct answer because it's a state power. Alternatively, executive or judicial power wouldn't support a law because those are for different branches, but the question is about the powers that support federal laws, which are legislative in nature.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled up. Let me try to clarify.

The federal government's authority to pass laws comes from specific enumerated powers. The police power is not one of them; it's a state power. So a federal law can't be based solely on police power. Therefore, option J is the correct answer.

So the answer is J.

The question asks which power, standing alone, cannot support federal law. To determine this, it is important to analyze each option:

- **A: Defense power** - This is an enumerated power of the federal government, allowing Congress to provide for the common defense. It can support federal law.  
- **B: Treaty power** - The federal government has the authority to negotiate and ratify treaties, which can support federal law.  
- **C: Legislative power** - This is the general authority of Congress to make laws, so it can support federal law.  
- **D: Executive power** - While the executive branch enforces laws, it does not create them. However, the question is about supporting federal law, not who makes it, so this is less relevant.  
- **E: Judicial power** - The judiciary interprets laws but does not create them. Like executive power, it is not directly about supporting federal law.  
- **F: Commerce power** - A key enumerated power allowing Congress to regulate interstate commerce, which can support federal law.  
- **G: Spending power** - The federal government can spend for the general welfare, supporting federal law.  
- **H: Necessary and proper power** - This elastic clause allows Congress to pass laws necessary to carry out its enumerated powers, supporting federal law.  
- **I: Taxing power** - An enumerated power allowing the federal government to levy taxes, which can support federal law.  
- **J: Police power** - Police power is generally reserved to the states and is not an enumerated federal power. The federal government cannot pass laws based solely on police power unless it is tied to another enumerated power, such as the commerce clause.

Since police power is a state power and not a federal enumerated power, a federal law cannot be supported solely by police power. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**J**
