Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

So, Elsa values her time at $50 per hour and tutors David for two hours. David is willing to pay $175 for two hours of tutoring, but they negotiate a price of $125 for the entire two hours. The question is about the surplus hereâ€”like, who gains what and how it compares.

Hmm, I remember that in economics, there's consumer surplus and producer surplus. Consumer surplus is what the buyer saves from what they were willing to pay, and producer surplus is what the seller makes beyond their cost or valuation.

Let me break it down. David's willingness to pay is $175 for two hours. So, his maximum is $175. But he only pays $125. So, his consumer surplus would be the difference between what he was willing to pay and what he actually paid. That's 175 minus 125, which is $50. So David's surplus is $50.

Now, Elsa's side. She values her time at $50 per hour. So, for two hours, that's 2 times 50, which is $100. She gets paid $125 for two hours. So her producer surplus is what she gets minus her cost. So 125 minus 100 equals $25. So Elsa gains $25.

Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, is the producer surplus calculated per hour or for the total? Because she's being paid $125 for two hours. So her cost is $100, so her surplus is $25 total. So that's correct.

So the consumer surplus is $50, producer surplus is $25. So the question is asking which statement is true about the transaction.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Producer surplus less than consumer surplus by $50-$75. Wait, producer surplus is $25, consumer is $50. The difference is $25. So A says it's between 50 and 75. No, that's not correct.

Option B: Consumer equals producer surplus. 50 vs 25, so no.

Option C: Difference greater than 75. No, it's 25.

Option D: Difference is $50. Wait, 50 minus 25 is 25, so D is incorrect.

Option E: Consumer surplus is greater than producer by 50-75. 50-25 is 25, which is less than 50, so no.

Option F: Consumer surplus less than producer by 50-75. No, because consumer is higher.

Option G: Producer surplus greater than consumer surplus by 50-75. No, because producer is less.

Option H: Difference is $25. Because 50-25=25. So the difference is 25. So H is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the question. The options are about the difference; some mention whether one is greater than the other.

Wait the options are:

H: The difference between consumer and producer surplus is $25.

Yes, that's exactly what we have. So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: Prod < Cons by 50-75.

B: Equal.

C: Difference >75.

D: Difference is $50.

E: Cons > Prod by 50-75.

F: Cons < Prod by 50-75.

G: Prod > Cons by 50-75.

H: Difference is $25.

So yes, H is correct. So the correct answer is H.
</think>

The transaction involves Elsa tutoring David for two hours. David's willingness to pay is $175, but he pays $125, resulting in a consumer surplus of $50. Elsa values her time at $50 per hour, so her cost for two hours is $100. She receives $125, giving her a producer surplus of $25. The difference between consumer surplus ($50) and producer surplus ($25) is $25. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C, D, E, F, G**: Incorrect because the difference is $25, not within the ranges or amounts stated.
- **B**: Incorrect because the surpluses are not equal.
- **H**: Correct, as the difference between consumer and producer surplus is exactly $25.

Thus, the correct answer is:

H
