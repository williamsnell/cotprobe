Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a compressional wave moving through an iron rod and then into the air. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on wave properties, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The problem states that the frequency of the wave is 250 per second. Wait, frequency is in hertz, right? So that's 250 Hz. The wave's speed is given as 1.6 x 10^4 feet per second in iron and 1.1 x 10^3 feet per second in air. And the question is asking for the wavelength in each material.

I remember that the basic formula relating wave speed, frequency, and wavelength is v = f * λ. So, the velocity of the wave equals the frequency multiplied by the wavelength. That should be the key here. Since the frequency remains the same when the wave moves from one medium to another, but the speed changes, the wavelength must change accordingly.

Wait, no, frequency actually doesn't change when moving between different media. It's the speed and wavelength that change. Oh right, because frequency is determined by the source, and it stays the same when the wave enters a new medium. So in this case, the frequency is 250 Hz in both iron and air. But the speed of the wave changes, so the wavelength must change too.

So, for each medium, I can calculate the wavelength using the formula λ = v / f.

Let me compute this for iron first. The speed in iron is 1.6e4 ft/s. So λ_iron = (1.6e4) / 250. Let me compute that. 1.6e4 is 16000. 16000 divided by 250. Let me do the division: 250 times 64 is 16,000 because 250*60=15,000 and 250*4=1000, so 64 would be 16,000. So λ_iron is 64 feet.

Wait, wait. Wait, 1.6e4 is 16,000? No, wait. 1e4 is 10,000. So 1.6e4 is 16,000. Oh right, yes. So 16,000 divided by 250. Let me double-check that. 250 * 60 = 15,000, and 250 * 64 = 16,000. So yes, 64 feet in iron.

Now for air, the speed is 1.1e3 ft/s, which is 1100 ft/s. So λ_air = 1100 / 250. Let me compute that. 250 times 4 is 1000, so 4.4 times 250 is 1100. So λ_air is 4.4 feet.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check which option has 64 ft in iron and 4.4 ft in air. Let me look at the options again.

Option J says 64 ft in iron, 4.4 ft in air. So that's the one that matches my calculations.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's recheck the numbers.

For iron:
v = 1.6e4 ft/s = 16,000 ft/s
f = 250 Hz
λ = v/f = 16000 / 250 = 64 ft. Correct.

For air:
v = 1.1e3 ft/s = 1100 ft/s
f=250 Hz
λ = 1100 / 250 = 4.4 ft. Correct.

So the correct answer should be option J.

To solve the problem, we use the relationship between wave speed, frequency, and wavelength: 

\[
v = f \cdot \lambda \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda = \frac{v}{f}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the wavelength in iron
The speed of the wave in iron is \( v_{\text{iron}} = 1.6 \times 10^4 \, \text{ft/s} = 16,000 \, \text{ft/s} \), and the frequency is \( f = 250 \, \text{Hz} \). Using the formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{iron}} = \frac{v_{\text{iron}}}{f} = \frac{16,000}{250} = 64 \, \text{ft}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the wavelength in air
The speed of the wave in air is \( v_{\text{air}} = 1.1 \times 10^3 \, \text{ft/s} = 1,100 \, \text{ft/s} \), and the frequency remains \( f = 250 \, \text{Hz} \). Using the formula:

\[
\lambda_{\text{air}} = \frac{v_{\text{air}}}{f} = \frac{1,100}{250} = 4.4 \, \text{ft}.
\]

### Step 3: Match the results to the options
From the calculations, the wavelength in iron is \( 64 \, \text{ft} \), and the wavelength in air is \( 4.4 \, \text{ft} \). Comparing these values to the given options, the correct choice is:

**Option J: 64 ft in iron, 4.4 ft in air.**
