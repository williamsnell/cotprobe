Okay, so I've got this problem about the diffusion rate of n-butanol from the bottom of a cylindrical container into air. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on diffusion calculations, but let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that diffusion rate can be calculated using Fick's Law. Fick's Law states that the diffusion flux is proportional to the concentration gradient and the diffusion coefficient. The formula is usually something like J = -D * (dc/dx), where J is the flux, D is the diffusivity, and dc/dx is the concentration gradient.

Wait, but in this case, the setup is a container where n-butanol is at the bottom, and air is flowing over the top. The depth of the n-butanol surface is 6 feet below the top. So the n-butanol is evaporating into the air above it. Since pure air is being passed over, I think the concentration of n-butanol at the top (where it meets the air) is zero because it's pure air. At the surface of the n-butanol (the bottom), the concentration should be the saturation concentration, right?

So the container is cylindrical, but the problem doesn't specify the radius or anything, so maybe it's not needed. Oh wait, because the question asks for the diffusion rate per unit area, so the area might cancel out.

Wait, let me think about the variables given:

- Pressure: 1 atm (probably standard pressure, so that's good for calculating concentrations)
- Temperature: 70°F. Oh, I need to convert that to Celsius or Kelvin because most formulas use those. Let's see, 70°F is (70-32)*5/9 = (38)*5/9 ≈ 21.11°C. But wait, for gas-phase calculations, sometimes we use Kelvin. So 21.11 + 273.15 = 294.26 K.

Diffusivity (D) of air-n-butanol is given as 8.57e-6 m²/sec.

The depth of the n-butanol surface is 6.0 ft below the top. Oh wait, I should convert that to meters because the other units are in meters. 6 ft is 1.8288 meters. So the distance (x) over which diffusion occurs is 1.8288 meters.

Assuming steady-state conditions, and that the concentration at the top (x=0) is zero, and at the surface (x=1.8288 m), the concentration is the saturation concentration of n-butanol in air at 70°F and 1 atm.

Wait, so I need the saturation concentration of n-butanol at these conditions. How do I find that? I think the saturation concentration can be found using the ideal gas law. The vapor pressure of n-butanol at 70°F would give me the partial pressure, and then I can find the molar concentration.

What's the vapor pressure of n-butanol at 70°F? I'm not exactly sure, but I might need to look it up or use an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given data to find it. Wait, no, the problem doesn't provide the vapor pressure, so maybe I'm missing something here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should remember that the concentration C can be expressed as C = P/(RT), where P is the partial pressure (vapor pressure here), R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

So first, I need the vapor pressure of n-butanol at 70°F. Let me think. I remember that n-butanol has a vapor pressure around 0.028 atm at 25°C. But wait, 25°C is about 77°F. Wait, no, 25°C is 77°F, but our temperature here is 70°F, which is 21.11°C. So maybe the vapor pressure is lower than 0.028 atm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to know or find the vapor pressure. Since I can't look it up right now, perhaps I can proceed with the formula and see what variables I have.

Wait, let's outline the steps:

1. Calculate the concentration gradient (dc/dx) across the 6 ft (1.8288 m) column.
2. Use Fick's Law to find the diffusion flux (J).

So the concentration at the bottom (x = 1.8288 m) is C_s, the saturation concentration, and at the top (x = 0), it's zero. So the concentration gradient is (C_s - 0)/(1.8288 m - 0) )= C_s / 1.8288 m.

Wait, no, wait. Fick's Law says J = -D * dc/dx. Since the concentration decreases as you move upward, dc/dx is negative, so J would be positive if we take the magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the setup is that at x=0 (top), C=0, and at x=L (bottom), C=C_s. So the concentration gradient is (C_s - 0)/(L - 0) ) = C_s / L.

Wait, no, because in Fick's Law, it's the change per unit distance. So if the distance is L, then the gradient is (C_s - 0)/(L), which is C_s / L.

But wait, Fick's Law in one dimension is J = -D * (dC/dx). Since the concentration is higher at the bottom (x = L) and decreases as x decreases, dC/dx is negative. So J would be positive, representing diffusion upward.

So J = D * (C_s / L).

Wait, that makes sense because if C_s is higher, the flux is higher. And if the distance L is larger, the gradient is smaller, so flux decreases.

So the first thing is to find C_s, the concentration in kmol/m³ at the surface of the n-butanol.

C_s = (P_vapor) / (RT)

Where P_vapor is the vapor pressure of n-butanol at 70°F (in Pascals, probably), R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.

So I need to find P_vapor. But I don't have that information. Hmm. Did I miss something in the problem statement? Let me read again.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't provide the vapor pressure. So maybe I need to use some other approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given data without needing the vapor pressure. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's consider that perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the concentration at the surface is the saturation concentration, which I can get from the ideal gas law. But without the vapor pressure, I can't compute that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the question is about the diffusion of n-butanol through a stagnant air layer. In that case, maybe I can model it using Fick's Law as J = D * (C_s - C_0)/L, where C_0 is zero. So J = D * C_s / L.

But again, without C_s, I can't compute it. So perhaps the problem expects me to compute C_s using some given information. Wait, the problem gives the diffusivity, which is D, and the depth is L. So perhaps the missing piece is the vapor pressure of n-butanol.

Wait, perhaps I can recall the vapor pressure of n-butanol at certain temperatures. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to use the Antoine equation to estimate it, but that's getting complicated and I don't have the Antoine constants memorized.

Wait, n-butanol's vapor pressure at 25°C (77°F) is about 0.028 atm. Since our temperature is 70°F (21.11°C), which is lower, the vapor pressure should be lower. Let me think, perhaps around 0.015 atm? I'm not certain, but maybe that's a ballpark. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an exact approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the given data and compute the flux without directly needing the vapor pressure. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe I can express the answer in terms of P, but that's not helpful here.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. Maybe the container is a cylinder, and the n-butanol is at the bottom. But the surface of the n-butanol is 6 ft below the top, so the depth of the air above the liquid is 6 ft. So the diffusion path length is 6 ft. So the distance L is 6 ft, which is 1.8288 meters.

Wait, but I'm still stuck on finding C_s. How can I proceed without the vapor pressure? Maybe the problem provides the data for the vapor pressure elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to assume that the concentration at the surface is the saturation concentration, and the problem expects me to compute it using the ideal gas law, but for that, I need the vapor pressure.

Wait, perhaps I can find the vapor pressure of n-butanol at 70°F. Let me think. I've heard that n-butanol has a boiling point of about 117°C, so at 21°C, it's way below boiling, so the vapor pressure should be low. At 25°C, it's about 0.028 atm, so at 21°C, maybe around 0.015 to 0.02 atm. Let's say approximately 0.018 atm for estimation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up an approximate value. Wait, I'm just making this up here, but perhaps for the sake of moving forward, I'll proceed with an assumed vapor pressure. Let's say 0.015 atm.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I'm missing something. The question is about the diffusion rate of n-butanol. Oh wait, maybe I can use the molar mass of n-butanol to find the mass transfer rate, but that's not directly relevant here since the question asks for kgmol per area per time.

Wait, let me try to outline the calculations I can perform:

Assuming C_s is P_vapor / (RT), with R being 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) (since R can be in those units when using atm and liters). But wait, R can also be in J units, which is m³·Pa/(mol·K). Let me clarify the units.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is equivalent to 8.314 m³·Pa/(mol·K). But if I'm using P in atm, I need to convert it to Pascals. So 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

So, C_s (in mol/m³) = (P_vapor in Pa) / (R*T).

But without P_vapor, I can't compute C_s. Hmm. This is a problem.

Wait, perhaps the question provides the necessary data somewhere else. Let me recheck the problem statement.

Wait, the problem gives the diffusivity as 8.57e-6 m²/sec. The surface is 6 ft below the top, so L = 1.8288 m. The pressure is 1 atm, T=70°F=294.26 K. So everything except the vapor pressure is given. So perhaps the problem expects me to know the vapor pressure, or perhaps I'm supposed to assume that it's negligible and something else applies.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is assuming that the concentration is such that the solution is dilute, and hence Fick's Law can be applied directly. But I'm not seeing how without C_s.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the formula for the diffusion rate (flux):

J = (D * C_s) / L

Where C_s is the concentration at the surface.

So, C_s = (P_vapor) / (R*T)

So, J = (D * P_vapor) / (R*T * L)

But without P_vapor, I can't compute J. So perhaps the problem expects me to know the vapor pressure of n-butanol at 70°F.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I can find an approximate value. Let me think again: n-butanol's vapor pressure at 25°C is about 0.028 atm. At 20°C, it's lower. Let me try to find an approximate value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that at 20°C, the vapor pressure of n-butanol is around 0.015 atm. Let's say approximately 0.015 atm for this problem. So P_vapor = 0.015 atm.

Now, converting that to Pascals: 0.015 atm * 101325 Pa/atm = 1520.875 Pa.

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is 8.314 m³·Pa/(mol·K).

T is 294.26 K.

So C_s = 1520.875 Pa / (8.314 m³·Pa/(mol·K) * 294.26 K) 

Let me compute the denominator first: 8.314 * 294.26 ≈ 2448.2 m³·Pa/(mol)

So C_s ≈ 1520.875 / 2448.2 ≈ 0.6205 mol/m³.

Wait, that seems low. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, 8.314 * 294.26 K = let's compute that more accurately.

8.314 * 294.26 = let's compute 8 * 294.26 = 2354.08, 0.314*294.26≈92.45. So total ≈2354.08+92.45=2446.53 m³·Pa/(mol).

So C_s = 1520.875 / 2446.53 ≈ 0.6215 mol/m³.

So J = (D * C_s) / L

D is 8.57e-6 m²/s.

C_s is 0.6215 mol/m³.

L is 1.8288 m.

So J = (8.57e-6 m²/s * 0.6215 mol/m³) / 1.8288 m

Let me compute numerator first: 8.57e-6 * 0.6215 ≈ 5.325e-6 (m²/s * mol/m³) = 5.325e-6 mol/(m·s).

Then divide by 1.8288 m: 5.325e-6 / 1.8288 ≈ 2.911e-6 mol/(m²·s).

Wait, but the options are in the range of 1e-9 to 2e-9 kgmol/(m²·s). Hmm, that's way lower than what I'm getting. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me check the units again. Because I think I messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is equivalent to m³·Pa/(mol·K). So when I compute C_s, it's in mol/m³.

But the flux J is in mol/(m²·s). But the options are in kgmol/(m²·s). So I need to convert from mol to kgmol.

Wait, n-butanol has a molecular weight. Let me recall. n-butanol is C4H9OH, which has a molecular weight of (4*12) + (10*1) + 16 + 1 = 48 +10 +16 +1 = 75 g/mol. So 75 g/mol = 0.075 kg/mol.

So, the flux in kgmol/(m²·s) would be J * (1 kgmol / 1000 mol) * (1 / 0.075 kg/mol).

Wait, no, let me think again. If I have J in mol/(m²·s), and I want to convert to kgmol/(m²·s), I divide by 1000, because 1 kgmol is 1000 mol.

Wait no, because 1 kgmol = 1000 mol, so to convert from mol/(m²·s) to kgmol/(m²·s), multiply by 1e-3.

Wait, let me clarify. If J is in mol/(m²·s), then to get kgmol/(m²·s), you divide by 1000.

So J_kgmol = J_mol * 1e-3.

In my earlier calculation, I got J ≈ 2.911e-6 mol/(m²·s), which would be 2.911e-9 kgmol/(m²·s). Hmm, looking at the options, option I is 1.70e-9, option E is 1.80e-9, and option C is 1.90e-9. So 2.9e-9 isn't among the options. So perhaps my vapor pressure assumption is way off.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the vapor pressure. Let me try a different approach. Let's say the vapor pressure is higher, maybe 0.02 atm. Let's recalculate.

P_vapor = 0.02 atm = 0.02 * 101325 Pa = 2026.5 Pa.

C_s = 2026.5 / (8.314 * 294.26) ≈ 2026.5 / 2446.53 ≈ 0.828 mol/m³.

Then J = (8.57e-6 * 0.828) / 1.8288.

Compute numerator: 8.57e-6 * 0.828 ≈ 7.10e-6.

Divide by 1.8288: 7.10e-6 / 1.8288 ≈ 3.88e-6 mol/(m²·s) → 3.88e-9 kgmol/(m²·s).

Still not matching the options. Hmm. Maybe the vapor pressure is lower than 0.015 atm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Antoine equation to find the vapor pressure. The Antoine equation is log10(P) = A - (B)/(T + C), where P is in mmHg, and T is in Celsius.

I think the Antoine constants for n-butanol are A=4.44299, B=1783.47, C=244.485. So let me calculate.

T in Celsius is 21.11°C.

So P_mmHg = 10^(4.44299 - 1783.47/(21.11 + 244.485)).

Compute denominator: 21.11 + 244.485 = 265.595.

1783.47 / 265.595 ≈ 6.718.

So 4.44299 - 6.718 ≈ -2.275.

So P_mmHg = 10^(-2.275) ≈ 5.3 mmHg.

Convert that to atm: 5.3 mmHg * (1 atm / 760
