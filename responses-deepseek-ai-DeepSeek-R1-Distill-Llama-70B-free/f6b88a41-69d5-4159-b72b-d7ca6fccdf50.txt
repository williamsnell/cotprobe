C: the vast number of individuals and agents who contribute to climate change
D: the idea that it's not rational for each individual to restrict his or her own pollution

Okay, so I need to figure out what "the fragmentation of agency" refers to in Gardiner's article. I remember that Gardiner discusses ethical issues related to climate change, particularly focusing on why it's such a difficult problem to address. He mentions something about a "perfect moral storm," which combines factors like the global nature of the problem, the intergenerational aspects, and the psychological and economic challenges.

The question is about "fragmentation of agency." I think I've heard the term before in the context of collective action problems. So, agency usually refers to the capacity of an individual or group to act independently. Fragmentation would imply that this capacity is being split or broken into parts. 

Looking at the options:

Option A: An agent's inability to acknowledge their contribution. Hmm, that sounds more like denial or lack of awareness, not exactly fragmentation of agency.

Option B: Fragmentation of effects across generations. That relates to intergenerational issues, which Gardiner does talk about, but is that about agency or the effects?

Option C: The vast number of individuals contributing. So, if there are many agents, each contributing a small part, their individual agency is fragmented because no single person's actions alone cause significant harm. This makes collective action hard because each feels their contribution is negligible.

Option D: Not rational for individuals to restrict pollution. This sounds like the prisoner's dilemma or tragedy of the commons, where individual rationality leads to collective irrationality. But does it relate to fragmentation of agency? Or is it more about the rationality of action?

So, fragmentation of agency probably refers to the fact that the cause of climate change comes from the actions of many individuals and agents, making it hard to pinpoint responsibility or collective action. Each person's impact is small, so they don't feel the need to change their behavior because the effect of their actions alone doesn't seem significant.

Wait, but Option D says it's not rational for each individual to restrict their own pollution. That's because the costs to them are immediate, while the benefits of reducing emissions are spread out and in the future. So, each individual's rational choice leads to a worse outcome for everyone, which is a collective action problem.

But wait, the question is specifically about "fragmentation of agency." So, is it about the structure of the problem where each agent's actions are so dispersed that no one feels responsible? That would point to Option C.

Alternatively, Option D is about the rational choice aspect. So, which is it?

I think in Gardiner's work, the fragmentation of agency refers to the fact that the problem is caused by a multitude of individual actions, each of which doesn't seem significant on its own. So, when you have so many agents contributing, each with a small impact, it's hard to get anyone to take responsibility or act because they don't see their individual effect as meaningful.

So, Option C says it's the vast number of individuals contributing. That makes sense because the fragmentation comes from the dispersion of agency across many agents.

Wait, but another angle: the fragmentation could also be that each individual's contribution is so small that they don't feel their agency matters. So, it's about the diffusion of responsibility.

Alternatively, the term might be used to explain that because so many agents are involved, each doesn't feel the need to act, as their individual impact is negligible. So, it's a collective action problem where each agent's power is fragmented.

So, the correct answer would be C: the vast number of individuals and agents who contribute to climate change.

Wait, but another thought: Option D is about the idea that it's not rational for each individual to restrict their own pollution. That's more about the economics and the prisoner's dilemma aspect. So, the fragmentation of agency is more about the structure of the problem where agency is spread out, making individual actions seem inconsequential. So, Option C is about the number of agents, which leads to the fragmentation.

Yes, I think that's right. So, the answer should be C.

The concept of "the fragmentation of agency" in Gardiner's article refers to the idea that climate change is caused by the actions of a vast number of individuals and agents, each contributing a small part to the problem. This dispersion of agency makes it difficult for any single individual or group to feel responsible or take meaningful action, as the impact of their individual actions seems negligible. This fragmentation leads to a collective action problem, where the cumulative effect of many small actions results in significant harm, but no single agent feels compelled to change their behavior.

Option C captures this idea by highlighting the vast number of individuals and agents contributing to climate change, which is the essence of the fragmentation of agency.

Answer: C
