Question:

Define Piaget's preoperational stage of cognitive development. Name and describe its twosubstages. The Conceptual Period of Intelligence Stage 1. Preoperational (2 - 7 yrs.) a.Preconceptual (18 mos. - 4 yrs.) First such use of representational thought and symbols, such as words, for objects; classification of objects. b. Intuitive thought (4 - 7 yrs.) Beginning of reasoning, but thinking is fragmented, centered on parts of things, rigid, and based wholly on appearances. 2. Concrete operations (7 - 11 yrs.) Can perform mental operations and reverse them. Can add up "all the marbles." Operations are however confined to concrete and tangible objects that are immediately present. 3. Formal operations (12 - 15 yrs.) Can form hypotheses, can go beyond operations appearances to deal with the truth or falsity of propositions.

Options:

A: The preoperational stage includes the intuitive thought substage from ages 2 to 4 and the formal operations substage from ages 4 to 7.
B: The preoperational stage consists of a single phase of development that spans from ages 2 to 7, without distinct substages.
C: The preoperational stage includes the preconceptual substage from ages 7 to 11 and the intuitive thought substage from ages 11 to 15.
D: The preoperational stage is characterized by abstract thinking and hypothetical reasoning from ages 4 to 7.
E: The preoperational stage is from birth to 2 years.
F: The preoperational stage consists of two substages: The preconceptual which lasts from ages 2 to 4 and the intuitive thought which extends from ages 4 to 7.
G: The preoperational stage consists of three substages: The preconceptual, concrete operations, and formal operations.
H: The preoperational stage involves logical thinking and reasoning.
I: The preoperational stage consists of two substages: The sensorimotor stage which lasts from birth to age 2, and the concrete operational stage which begins at age 2.
J: The preoperational stage consists of two substages: The symbolic function substage from ages 2 to 4 and the operational thought substage from ages 4 to 7.

Okay, so I've got this question about Piaget's stages of cognitive development, specifically the preoperational stage. I remember that Piaget had four main stages, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through.

The question is asking me to define the preoperational stage and name its two substages. From what I recall, the preoperational stage comes after the sensorimotor stage and before the concrete operational stage. Oh wait, the sensorimotor is the first one, from birth to about 2 years. So the preoperational should be next.

I think the preoperational stage is roughly from ages 2 to 7. During this time, children start using symbols and language but aren't yet able to think logically. They might have some egocentrism too. Now, the substages... I think there are two. The first one is called the preconceptual substage, and the second is the intuitive thought substage. 

Wait, let me get the ages right. The preconceptual substage is probably earlier, maybe from 2 to 4 years. That's when children start using symbols, like language, but their thinking isn't very logical yet. They might not understand conservation or reversibility. Then the intuitive thought substage comes next, around 4 to 7 years. Here, kids start to reason but it's still not logical. Their thinking is more centered on what they can see, so they make judgments based on appearances rather than logic.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one correctly describes these two substages in the preoperational stage. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says it includes the intuitive thought from 2-4 and formal operations from 4-7. Wait, formal operations come way later, around 12 and up, so this must be wrong.

Option B says it's a single phase from 2-7 without substages. But I'm pretty sure there are two substages, so B is incorrect.

Option C mentions substages from 7-11 and 11-15. Those are concrete and formal operations, so not part of preoperational. So C is wrong.

Option D talks about abstract thinking and hypothetical reasoning from 4-7. That sounds more like the formal operations stage, so D is incorrect.

Option E says the preoperational is from birth to 2, which is the sensorimotor stage, so E is wrong.

Option F says the preoperational has two substages: preconceptual from 2-4 and intuitive from 4-7. That matches what I was thinking. So F looks correct.

Option G mentions three substages, including concrete and formal. Those are separate stages, so G is wrong.

Option H says it's about logical thinking, which is more concrete operations, so H is incorrect.

Option I includes sensorimotor and concrete operational, which are different stages, so I is wrong.

Option J talks about symbolic function and operational thought. Symbolic function sounds like part of the sensorimotor stage, and operational thought is a different stage altogether, so J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be F.

The preoperational stage, according to Jean Piaget, spans from approximately 2 to 7 years of age. It is characterized by the development of symbolic thinking and language, though logical reasoning is not yet fully developed. This stage is divided into two substages:

1. **Preconceptual Substage (2-4 years):** During this phase, children begin using symbols and language to represent the world. However, their thinking is still egocentric and lacks logical structure.

2. **Intuitive Thought Substage (4-7 years):** In this phase, children start to use reasoning, but their thinking remains fragmented and centered on appearances rather than logic.

Among the provided options, only Option F correctly identifies these two substages and their respective age ranges.

Answer: F
