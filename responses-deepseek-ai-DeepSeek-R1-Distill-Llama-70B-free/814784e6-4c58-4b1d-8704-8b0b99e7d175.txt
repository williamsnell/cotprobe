Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about calculating the profit in U.S. dollars for a product sold in Europe. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The U.S. manufacturer has a production operation in Mexico. The product costs 116.50 pesos to produce and ship to Europe. There, it sells for 20 euros. I need to find out the profit in U.S. dollars.

Hmm, so profit is usually revenue minus cost. So I'll need to calculate both the revenue from selling the product in euros and the cost in pesos, then convert both to U.S. dollars to find the profit.

Wait, but let me make sure. The cost is in Mexican pesos, and the selling price is in euros. So I'll have to convert both to USD to subtract them.

The exchange rates given are a bit tricky. It says 0.1099 U.S. dollars are required to buy one Mexican peso. So that means 1 peso equals 0.1099 USD. Because if you need 0.1099 USD to get one peso, then each peso is worth that amount in USD.

Similarly, it says 0.8928 USD are needed to buy one euro. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, if you need 0.8928 USD to buy one euro, that means one euro equals 0.8928 USD. Because if I have euros and I want USD, how much USD do I get per euro? Or wait, maybe I'm getting this backwards. Let's think: if I have USD and I want to buy euros, how much USD do I need per euro? Because the question says 0.8928 USD are required to buy one euro. So 1 euro costs 0.8928 USD. So when converting euros to USD, I would multiply the euros by 0.8928.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. Exchange rates can be a bit confusing. So, when the question says "0.8928 U.S. dollars are required to buy one euro", that implies that 1 euro = 0.8928 USD. So to convert euros to USD, you multiply the euro amount by 0.8928.

Similarly, for the Mexican peso, 0.1099 USD buys one peso. So 1 peso equals 0.1099 USD. So to convert pesos to USD, you multiply the peso amount by 0.1099.

So first, calculate the cost in USD. The cost is 116.50 pesos. So 116.50 * 0.1099 USD.

Let me compute that. 116.50 times 0.1099. Let's see, 100 * 0.1099 is 10.99. 16.50 * 0.1099: 16 * 0.1099 is about 1.7584, and 0.5 * 0.1099 is 0.05495. So total for 16.50 is 1.7584 + 0.05495 = 1.81335. So total cost in USD is 10.99 + 1.81335 = 12.80335 USD. Let me round that to, say, 12.803 USD.

Now the revenue is 20 euros. Each euro is 0.8928 USD. So 20 * 0.8928 equals... 20 * 0.89 is 17.8, and 0.0028 *20 is 0.056. So total is 17.856 USD.

Wait, wait, 20 * 0.8928: 20 * 0.8 is 16, 20 * 0.09 is 1.8, 20 * 0.0028 is 0.056. So 16 +1.8 is 17.8, plus 0.056 is 17.856 USD.

So revenue is 17.856 USD, and cost is 12.803 USD. Profit is revenue minus cost: 17.856 - 12.803.

Let me subtract: 17.856 minus 12.803. 17 -12 is 5, 0.856 - 0.803 is 0.053. So total profit is 5.053 USD.

Wait, let me double-check the subtraction. 12.803 from 17.856:

17.856
-12.803
= ?

Let me subtract digit by digit:

17.856
-12.803
-----------
5.053.

Yes, that's correct.

So the profit is approximately 5.053 USD. Now looking at the options, let's see: the options are A: $8.50, B:4.50, C:6.50, D:5.06, E:7.50, F:6.11, G:7.20, H:9.60, I:5.50, J:10.00.

So 5.053 is closest to option D:5.06 or option I:5.50. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I approximated too much. Let me recalculate the cost and the revenue more precisely.

First, calculating the cost: 116.50 pesos * 0.1099 USD/peso.

Let me compute 116.50 * 0.1099.

Let me write it as 116.5 * 0.1099.

Compute step by step:

0.1099 * 100 = 10.99
0.1099 * 16.5 = ?

Compute 16 * 0.1099: 1.7584
0.5 * 0.1099: 0.05495
Total for 16.5: 1.7584 + 0.05495 = 1.81335

So total cost is 10.99 + 1.81335 = 12.80335 USD.

Revenue: 20 euros * 0.8928 USD/euro = 20 * 0.8928.

20 * 0.8928: 17.856 USD.

Profit: 17.856 - 12.80335 = 5.05265 USD.

So approximately 5.05265, which is about 5.05 USD.

Looking at the options, the closest is D:5.06. That's very close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the exchange rate calculations. Let me check the exchange rates again.

Wait, wait, the question says:

0.1099 USD are required to buy one peso. So 1 peso = 0.1099 USD.

Similarly, 0.8928 USD are required to buy one euro, so 1 euro = 0.8928 USD.

So the calculations were correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recalculate 116.50 * 0.1099 exactly.

Let me compute 116.50 * 0.1099.

Compute as:

116.50 * 0.1 = 11.65

116.50 * 0.0099 = ?

Compute 116.50 * 0.01 = 1.165. So 0.0099 is 0.99 * 0.01. So 1.165 * 0.99 = ?

1.165 * 0.99 = 1.165 - 0.01165 = 1.15335.

So total cost is 11.65 + 1.15335 = 12.80335 USD.

That's correct.

Revenue: 20 * 0.8928 = 17.856 USD.

Profit: 17.856 - 12.80335 = 5.05265 â‰ˆ 5.05 USD.

Looking at the options, D is 5.06, which is very close. So perhaps the exact calculation would give us 5.05265, which is approximately 5.05, but the options don't have 5.05. So D is 5.06, which is the closest.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the exchange rates were applied correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have converted the cost and revenue the other way. Wait, let me think. For the cost: the product costs 116.50 pesos, which is a cost in Mexico. So to find the USD equivalent, since 1 peso is 0.1099 USD, then 116.50 * 0.1099 is correct.

Similarly, the selling price is 20 euros. Each euro is 0.8928 USD, so 20 * 0.8928 is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the exchange rates were given as USD per foreign currency, which is correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should have converted the cost from pesos to USD and the revenue from euros to USD, then subtract. But that's exactly what I did.

So profit is 5.05 USD approx. The options don't have 5.05, but D is 5.06, which is the closest. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me check if the exchange rates are given as USD per peso and USD per euro, which they are. So the approach was correct.

I think I'm confident that the correct answer is D: $5.06.

To calculate the profit in U.S. dollars, we need to determine both the cost and revenue in USD and then find the difference.

### Step 1: Convert the cost from Mexican pesos to USD
The cost to produce and ship the product is 116.50 pesos. Using the exchange rate of 1 peso = 0.1099 USD, the cost in USD is:

\[
\text{Cost in USD} = 116.50 \times 0.1099 = 12.80335 \, \text{USD}
\]

### Step 2: Convert the revenue from euros to USD
The product sells for 20 euros in Europe. Using the exchange rate of 1 euro = 0.8928 USD, the revenue in USD is:

\[
\text{Revenue in USD} = 20 \times 0.8928 = 17.856 \, \text{USD}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the profit
Profit is calculated as revenue minus cost:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue in USD} - \text{Cost in USD} = 17.856 - 12.80335 = 5.05265 \, \text{USD}
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The calculated profit of approximately $5.05 USD is closest to option **D: $5.06**.
