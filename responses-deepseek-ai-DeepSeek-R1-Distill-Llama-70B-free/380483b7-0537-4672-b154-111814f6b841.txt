Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about intention tremors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my neurology, but let me think through this.

Intention tremor... I remember it's a type of tremor, but what's the difference between the types? Oh right, there's resting tremors and action tremors. Resting tremors are when the limb is relaxed, like in Parkinson's. Action tremors happen when you move, like during voluntary movement.

Wait, intention tremor is a specific kind of action tremor. I think it's most noticeable when you're trying to do something intentional, like reaching for something. So it's during purposeful movement, not at rest.

Now, where does intention tremor come from? I believe it's related to the cerebellum. The cerebellum is involved in coordinating movements. If there's damage there, like from a lesion, it might cause this kind of tremor. So the symptom points towards a cerebellar issue.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's is more about dementia, not movement disorders. So probably not A.

Option B: Worse with alcohol. I'm not too sure, but I think alcohol might actually reduce some tremors, especially essential tremor. But wait, if someone has a cerebellar issue, would alcohol make it worse? Maybe because alcohol affects the cerebellum, so yes, maybe it worsens it. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option C: Frontal lobe lesion. Frontal lobe issues are more about motor planning, maybe like apraxia or other movement issues, but not specifically intention tremor. So probably not C.

Option D: Spinal cord damage. That would cause different issues, like loss of reflexes, maybe spasticity or other signs, not intention tremor. So D is unlikely.

Option E: Involuntary movement disorder. Well, tremors are involuntary, so this is true, but the question is which is true about intention tremor. So E is correct in a general sense, but I need to see if other options are more specific.

Option F: Cerebellar lesion. Yes, that's what I was thinking earlier. So F is likely correct.

Option G: Parkinson's Disease. Parkinson's causes resting tremors, not intention. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Worse at rest. No, intention tremor is worse during action, especially as the person tries to make precise movements. So H is wrong; the opposite is true.

Option I: Dyscalculia. That's a math disability, which I think is more related to parietal lobe issues. Not related to cerebellar problems, so I is probably wrong.

Option J: Occurs only during sleep. No, tremors during sleep might be different, like restless legs or something else. Intention tremor happens during wakeful movements.

So putting it together, the correct statements are F and E. But looking at the options, the question is which is true about intention tremor. So F says it's indicative of cerebellar lesion, and E says it's an involuntary movement disorder.

Wait, the question asks which is true. So both E and F could be correct, but I need to choose the best answer. The question is looking for a true statement. Let me think again.

Is intention tremor an involuntary movement disorder? Yes, because the person can't control it. So E is correct. But F is also correct because it's caused by cerebellar issues.

Wait, looking at the options, only one answer is correct. So which of these is true. Let me think about each option.

The question is about which is true, so each option may be a possible fact. So F is true because it's indicative of cerebellar lesion. E is also true. Hmm, but the options are structured so that only one is correct. Let me check my notes.

Wait, I recall that intention tremor is indeed associated with cerebellar damage. So F is correct. Additionally, E is correct in a general sense, but the question is about which is true. So both E and F are true statements, but the options are A-J, so maybe only one is correct.

Wait, looking back, E says it's an involuntary movement disorder. That's correct, yes. So both E and F are correct. But looking at the options, are both options present?

Wait, looking at the options:

E: It is an involuntary movement disorder.

F: It is indicative of a cerebellar lesion.

So if both E and F are correct, but the options are separate, which one is the correct choice? The question is which is true, so both could be correct, but perhaps the better answer is F because it's more specific.

Wait, but the options are exclusive. So in the given choices, perhaps F is the intended correct answer because it's more specific to the nature of the tremor.

Alternatively, perhaps both E and F are correct, but since only one answer is allowed, I have to choose the best fit.

Wait, looking back, the question is which is true about intention tremor. So both E and F are true statements. But the options list each as separate. So perhaps the correct answers are E and F. But in the given options, only F is an option that's correct.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Intention tremor is an action tremor, which is a type of involuntary movement. So E is correct. It's caused by cerebellar lesions, so F is correct.

But the question is a single choice. So perhaps both E and F are correct, but looking at the options, only one can be chosen. Wait, looking at the user's options, each is a separate choice. So the correct answer would be both E and F, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question expects the most accurate statement, which is F.

Alternatively, perhaps E is correct because it's a movement disorder, but F is more specific.

Wait, the question is about which is true. So both E and F are true statements. But looking back, the options are single letters, so perhaps the correct answer is both E and F? But the options are A through J, so each is a separate choice.

Wait, perhaps the intended correct answer is F.

Wait, let me look at another approach. What's the definition of intention tremor?

Intention tremor is a specific type of action tremor that occurs during voluntary movement, especially during precise actions like reaching or touching something. It's a sign of cerebellar dysfunction. So F is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is F.
</think>

Intention tremor is a type of action tremor that occurs during voluntary movement, particularly during precise actions like reaching or touching something. It is most noticeable when a person makes intentional movements and is associated with cerebellar dysfunction. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Alzheimer's disease is primarily associated with cognitive decline, not movement disorders like intention tremor.
- **B**: Incorrect. Alcohol may reduce some tremors, but it does not specifically worsen intention tremor.
- **C**: Incorrect. Frontal lobe lesions are more associated with motor planning issues, not intention tremor.
- **D**: Incorrect. Spinal cord damage leads to other neurological issues, not intention tremor.
- **E**: Correct in a general sense, as intention tremor is an involuntary movement disorder, but it is not the most specific answer.
- **F**: Correct and more specific. Intention tremor is indicative of a cerebellar lesion, as it is caused by cerebellar dysfunction.
- **G**: Incorrect. Parkinson's disease causes resting tremors, not intention tremor.
- **H**: Incorrect. Intention tremor worsens during action, not at rest.
- **I**: Incorrect. Dyscalculia is unrelated to cerebellar function or intention tremor.
- **J**: Incorrect. Intention tremor occurs during wakeful movements, not during sleep.

While both **E** and **F** are true, **F** is the more specific and accurate answer regarding intention tremor. 

Answer: F
