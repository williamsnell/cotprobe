Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about glucose metabolism, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through each option step by step.

The question is asking which statement about glucose metabolism is correct. The options are A through H. I remember that glycolysis is the first step in glucose metabolism, so I'll focus on that.

Option A says the end-product of glycolysis in all cells is glucose. Wait, no, that can't be right. I remember that glycolysis breaks down glucose, so the end product shouldn't be glucose itself. In fact, I think glycolysis produces pyruvate. So A is incorrect.

Option B claims glycolysis doesn't require any enzymes. That doesn't make sense because every biochemical process requires enzymes to speed up reactions. Without enzymes, the reactions would be too slow. So B is wrong.

Option C states that in glycolysis, glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products. Yes, I recall that glycolysis splits glucose (a six-carbon molecule) into two three-carbon molecules called pyruvate. So C seems correct, but I'll check the other options.

Option D says glucose metabolism only occurs in the presence of oxygen. No, I remember that glycolysis happens in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The presence of oxygen affects later stages like the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, but glycolysis itself is oxygen-independent. So D is incorrect.

Option E claims glycolysis converts glucose into two fructose molecules. Wait, no. Glycolysis breaks glucose into pyruvate. Fructose is a different sugar, and I don't think that's part of glycolysis. Maybe E is confusing it with another pathway. So E is wrong.

Option F says glycolysis requires ATP only. I think glycolysis uses ATP in the initial steps but also produces some. So I'm not sure what 'only' refers to here. Wait, maybe it's about the type of energy molecules? Glycolysis uses ATP and produces it too, but the statement doesn't make much sense. I think F is incorrect.

Option G: Glucagon increases the rate of glycolysis. Hmm. Glucagon is a hormone released when blood sugar is low. It works to increase blood sugar by promoting glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis. Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose, so if glucagon is trying to raise blood sugar, it would inhibit glycolysis. Or wait, maybe in the liver, glucagon activates glycolysis? No, I'm a bit confused here. Wait, no, glucagon typically inhibits glycolysis. Insulin promotes glycolysis. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Glycolysis requires NADP+. No, I remember that glycolysis uses NAD+ as a coenzyme, not NADP+. NADP+ is more involved in anabolic reactions like fatty acid synthesis. So H is wrong.

Wait, going back to option C: yes, glycolysis does split glucose into two three-carbon products, which are pyruvate. So C is correct.

I think that's the only correct option. So the answer should be option C.

The correct answer is:

C: In glycolysis, glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products.

This is because glycolysis breaks down glucose (a six-carbon molecule) into two three-carbon molecules of pyruvate. Analysis of the other options shows they are incorrect for the reasons outlined. 

Answer: C
