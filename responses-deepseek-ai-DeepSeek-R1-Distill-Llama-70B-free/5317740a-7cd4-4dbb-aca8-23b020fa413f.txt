Okay, so I've got this problem here about Peter's pay raise, and I need to figure out the increase in his weekly gross pay. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem says Peter works 38 hours a week and earns $7.25 per hour. So, to find his original weekly gross pay, I think I should multiply the number of hours he works by his hourly wage. That makes sense because gross pay is just the total before any deductions.

So, doing the math: 38 hours multiplied by $7.25 per hour. Hmm, let me calculate that. 38 times 7 is 266, and 38 times 0.25 is 9.5. So adding those together, 266 + 9.5 equals $275.50. So Peter's original weekly gross pay is $275.50.

Now, his employer gives him a raise, and his new weekly gross pay becomes $307.80. To find the increase, I guess I subtract the original pay from the new pay. So that's $307.80 minus $275.50. Let me do that subtraction.

307.80 minus 275.50. Let's see, 307 minus 275 is 32, and 0.80 minus 0.50 is 0.30. So adding those together, it's $32.30. So the increase is $32.30.

Looking at the options, option A is $32.30. So that should be the correct answer. Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Original pay: 38 * 7.25. Let me compute 7.25 * 38 again. 7 times 38 is 266, and 0.25 times 38 is 9.5. 266 + 9.5 is indeed 275.50. New pay is 307.80. 307.80 - 275.50 = 32.30. Yep, that's correct. So the increase is $32.30, which is option A.

The increase in Peter's weekly gross pay is calculated by first determining his original pay and then subtracting it from his new pay. His original pay is 38 hours/week * $7.25/hour = $275.50. After the raise, his new pay is $307.80. The increase is $307.80 - $275.50 = $32.30. 

The correct answer is:

A: $32.30
