Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

What is differential reproduction? What factors bring about differential reproduction?

Options:

A: Differential reproduction is the result of equal survival rates for all genotypes within a population
B: Differential reproduction is driven exclusively by the presence of predators in an ecosystem
C: Differential reproduction occurs when certain traits prevent any mating from happening
D: Differential reproduction is when genetic mutations are the only factor influencing which offspring survive
E: Differential reproduction is purely based on random mating
F: Differential reproduction is determined solely by the environmental temperature during breeding seasons
G: Differential reproduction is related to the physical strength of the species
H: Differential reproduction is when all offsprings have the same genotype
I: Differential reproduction occurs when the percentage of viable offspring carrying a certain genotype cannot be accounted for by purely random mating. It results from nonrandom mating, differential fecundity, or differences in zygote viability or offspring fertility.
J: Differential reproduction occurs when all offspring inherit traits randomly, regardless of parental genotypes

Okay, so I have this question about differential reproduction and what factors cause it. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that this has something to do with natural selection and how different traits affect reproduction success. Let me think.

Differential reproduction, if I'm not mistaken, refers to how individuals with certain traits reproduce more successfully than others. So it's not just about surviving, but about passing on their genes. This leads to changes in the gene pool of a population over time.

The question has two parts: what differential reproduction is and the factors behind it. Looking at the options, I need to find the one that correctly describes both.

Option A says it's due to equal survival rates. Wait, equal survival would mean no differential reproduction, right? Because if everyone survives equally, there's no selection based on survival. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says it's driven by predators only. I don't think that's right. Predators can be a factor, but there are others like environment, resources, mates, etc. So B is too narrow.

Option C claims it's when traits prevent mating. That sounds like it could be a part of it, maybe related to mate choice. But differential reproduction isn't just about preventing mating entirely; it's about varying success in producing offspring. So maybe not C.

Option D says genetic mutations are the only factor. No, that can't be right. Environmental factors, behaviors, and other things influence reproduction success, not just mutations. So D is incorrect.

Option E is about random mating. If it's random, then there's no differential reproduction, right? Because everyone has the same chance. So E is not the answer.

Option F attributes it solely to environmental temperature. Temperature can affect breeding, but it's not the only factor. So F is too limited.

Option G talks about physical strength. That's a specific trait, but differential reproduction isn't solely based on strength. It can be any trait that affects reproductive success. So G is incorrect.

Option H says all offspring have the same genotype. That doesn't make sense because differential reproduction implies variation in reproduction based on different genotypes. So H is wrong.

Option I: This seems more comprehensive. It says differential reproduction happens when the percentage of viable offspring with certain genotypes isn't due to random mating. It results from non-random mating, differential fecundity (which is how fertile individuals are), or differences in zygote viability or offspring fertility. That makes sense because these factors would lead some individuals to reproduce more successfully than others.

Option J says offspring inherit traits randomly. That would mean no differential reproduction since everyone's traits are passed randomly, so no selection. So J is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer is I. It correctly describes the phenomenon and the factors involved.

The correct answer is:

I: Differential reproduction occurs when the percentage of viable offspring carrying a certain genotype cannot be accounted for by purely random mating. It results from nonrandom mating, differential fecundity, or differences in zygote viability or offspring fertility.

Answer: I
