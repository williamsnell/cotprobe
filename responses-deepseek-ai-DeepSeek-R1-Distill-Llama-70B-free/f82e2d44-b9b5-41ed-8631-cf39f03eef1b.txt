Okay, so I have this question about the Intelligence Quotient, or IQ. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology terms, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking how IQ is defined. The options are all different formulas, so I need to remember the correct formula for calculating IQ.

From what I remember, IQ is related to the concept of mental age compared to chronological age. I think it's something like dividing mental age by chronological age and then multiplying by 100. Oh wait, or was it the other way around? Like chronological age divided by mental age?

Wait, no, I think the original formula was mental age over chronological age times 100. So the formula is (mental age / chronological age) × 100. That would give a score where 100 is average. So if someone's mental age is the same as their chronological age, their IQ is 100. If their mental age is higher, the IQ is above 100, and if lower, below 100.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option F is chronological age divided by mental age times 100. That would give a lower score if mental age is higher, which doesn't make sense because a higher mental age should mean a higher IQ.

Option J is mental age divided by chronological age times 100. Yeah, that sounds right. So the formula should be (mental age / chronological age) × 100.

Wait, but I think I should double-check. Another thought: I remember that there are different types of IQ tests. Some use verbal scores, others performance scores. Oh wait, the original question doesn't specify which test, just the general definition. So it's about mental age versus chronological age.

So the correct formula is mental age over chronological age times 100, which is option J.

The Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is defined as a score calculated by dividing the mental age by the chronological age and then multiplying by 100. This formula ensures that an average IQ score is 100, with higher scores indicating a mental age greater than the chronological age and lower scores indicating the opposite. Among the given options, the correct formula corresponds to option J: mental age/chronological age × 100.
