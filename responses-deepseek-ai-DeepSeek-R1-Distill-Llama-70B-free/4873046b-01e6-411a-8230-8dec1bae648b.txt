Okay, I'm trying to figure out the inheritance pattern of malignant hyperthermia, also known as hyperpyrexia. I remember that this condition is related to anesthesia, right? Like, some people develop a severe reaction when given certain anesthetics.

So, I think about what I've learned in genetics. Malignant hyperthermia is a genetic disorder, but I'm not exactly sure which pattern it follows. I recall that many genetic diseases are autosomal dominant or recessive, or maybe X-linked.

Wait, I think it's autosomal dominant. Because I remember something about a family history where if one parent has it, each child has a 50% chance. That sounds dominant, not recessive. But wait, sometimes people can be carriers without showing symptoms, but in dominant cases, they usually show the trait.

Alternatively, maybe it's X-linked? No, I don't think so because the condition affects both males and females, and X-linked would more commonly affect males since they have only one X. But I'm not certain.

Another angle: I remember that mutations in the RYR1 gene are associated with malignant hyperthermia. Where is that gene located? Oh right, RYR1 is on chromosome 19, which is an autosomal chromosome. So it's not sex-linked.

So if it's on an autosomal chromosome, the pattern is either dominant or recessive. Now, is it dominant or recessive? I think that in many cases, when a parent has the condition, each child has a 50% chance of getting it. That points to autosomal dominant because dominant traits have a higher likelihood of being passed on and expressed.

Wait, but sometimes it's said that having the mutation doesn't always mean you'll get the condition; maybe it's variable expressivity. But that doesn't change the inheritance pattern, just the expression.

So putting it all together: autosomal dominant inheritance. Looking at the options, option J is autosomal dominant.

Malignant hyperthermia, also known as hyperpyrexia, is a genetic disorder often triggered by certain anesthetics. The condition is associated with mutations in the RYR1 gene, which is located on chromosome 19, an autosomal chromosome. This rules out X-linked or Y-linked inheritance. The disorder typically follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, where a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition. This is evident from family histories showing a 50% chance of transmission from an affected parent to each child. While variable expressivity may occur, the inheritance pattern itself remains autosomal dominant.

Answer: J
