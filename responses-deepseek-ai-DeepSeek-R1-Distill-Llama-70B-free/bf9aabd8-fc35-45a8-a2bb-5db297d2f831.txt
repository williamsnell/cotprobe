Question:

A small kiosk at the Atlanta airport carries souvenirs in the price range of $3.99 to $29.99, with a mean price of $14.75. The airport authorities decide to increase the rent charged for a kiosk by 5 percent. To make up for the increased rent, the kiosk owner decides to increase the prices of all items by 50 cents. As a result, which of the following will happen?

Options:

A: The range and standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents, but the mean price will remain the same.
B: The standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents, but the mean price and the range will remain the same.
C: The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the standard deviation of prices will remain the same.
D: The mean price will remain the same, but the standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents.
E: The mean price and the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.
F: The mean price and the standard deviation of prices will increase by 50 cents.
G: The mean price will remain the same, but the range of prices will increase by 50 cents.
H: The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the range of prices will decrease by 50 cents.
I: The mean price, the range, and the standard deviation of prices will all remain the same.
J: The range of prices will increase by 50 cents, but the mean price and the standard deviation will remain the same.

Okay, so I have this statistics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down. 

So, there's a kiosk at the Atlanta airport that sells souvenirs. The prices are between $3.99 and $29.99, and the average price is $14.75. The airport is increasing the rent by 5%, so the kiosk owner decides to raise all item prices by 50 cents to make up for it. The question is asking what happens to the mean, standard deviation, and range of the prices after this change.

Hmm. I remember that when you add a constant value to each data point, it affects certain measures but not others. Let me think about each measure:

1. **Mean**: If every item's price increases by 50 cents, then the average (mean) should also increase by 50 cents. Because adding a constant to each value shifts the entire distribution upwards by that amount. So the new mean would be $14.75 + $0.50 = $15.25. So any options that say the mean remains the same are probably incorrect.

2. **Range**: The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values. Originally, the range is $29.99 - $3.99 = $26.00. After adding 50 cents to every price, the new lowest is $3.99 + $0.50 = $4.49, and the new highest is $29.99 + $0.50 = $30.49. So the new range is $30.49 - $4.49 = $26.00. Oh wait, the range stays the same then. Because both the high and low increased by the same amount, their difference remains unchanged.

3. **Standard Deviation**: Standard deviation measures the spread of the data around the mean. If you add a constant to every data point, it shifts them all but doesn't change how spread out they are. So the standard deviation should stay the same. For example, if all prices go up by 50c, the distances from the new mean remain the same as before. So the SD doesn't change.

So putting this together: the mean increases by 50 cents, the range stays the same, and the standard deviation also stays the same.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the mean increases by 50c, but SD remains. That matches what I thought. Let me check the other options quickly.

Option E says mean and range increase by 50c. No, because the range doesn't change. 

Option F says mean and SD increase by 50c. No, SD doesn't change.

Option A says range and SD increase by 50c. No, both are wrong.

Option C is looking correct. 

Wait, let me make sure. The range calculation: initial range is 29.99-3.99=26. After adding 0.5 to both, it's 30.49-4.49=26. So yes, same range. So the range doesn't change, so any option saying range changes is wrong.

So the correct answer should be option C: The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the standard deviation of prices will remain the same.

When the kiosk owner increases the price of every item by 50 cents, the following effects on the statistical measures can be observed:

1. **Mean**: Adding a constant value (50 cents) to each data point shifts the entire distribution upwards by that amount. Therefore, the mean price will increase by 50 cents, from $14.75 to $15.25.

2. **Range**: The range is calculated as the difference between the highest and lowest prices. Originally, the range is $29.99 - $3.99 = $26.00. After the price increase, the new lowest price is $4.49 ($3.99 + $0.50), and the new highest price is $30.49 ($29.99 + $0.50). The new range is $30.49 - $4.49 = $26.00, which is unchanged. Thus, the range remains the same.

3. **Standard Deviation**: Standard deviation measures the spread of data around the mean. Adding a constant to every data point shifts the distribution but does not affect the spread. Therefore, the standard deviation remains unchanged.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C** correctly states that the mean increases by 50 cents, while the standard deviation remains the same. This matches the analysis above.
- Other options are incorrect because they either incorrectly state changes to the range or standard deviation.

The correct answer is:

**C: The mean price will increase by 50 cents, but the standard deviation of prices will remain the same.**
