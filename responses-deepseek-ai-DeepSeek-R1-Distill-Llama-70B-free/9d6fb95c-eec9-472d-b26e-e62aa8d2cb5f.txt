Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many cans of pears I can buy with $9.48 if 3 cans cost $2.37. Hmm, let's see. I'm not too confident about this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I think I should find out how much one can of pears costs. If 3 cans are $2.37, then dividing that by 3 should give me the price per can. Let me do that calculation. So 2.37 divided by 3. Wait, 3 times 0.79 is 2.37, right? Because 0.79 times 3 is 2.37. So each can is $0.79.

Now, I have $9.48 to spend. I need to find out how many cans that amount can buy. So I should divide the total money by the price per can. That would be 9.48 divided by 0.79. Hmm, doing division with decimals can be tricky. Maybe I can simplify this.

Wait, 0.79 is almost 0.80, which might be easier to calculate with. Let me see, if I approximate, 0.80 times 12 is 9.60. But that's a bit more than 9.48. So maybe 11 cans would be 0.79 * 11. Let me calculate that: 0.79 times 10 is 7.90, plus another 0.79 makes 8.69. That's way less than 9.48. So 11 cans would cost $8.69, leaving some money left. Hmm, but I need to find exactly how many cans I can buy without exceeding $9.48.

Alternatively, maybe I should do the exact division. Let me write it out:

9.48 รท 0.79. To make it easier, I can multiply both numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimals. So that becomes 948 รท 79.

Now, I can perform this division. Let's see how many times 79 goes into 948.

79 times 12 is 948 because 70 times 12 is 840, and 9 times 12 is 108; 840 + 108 = 948. Oh wait, so 79 * 12 = 948. So that means 948 divided by 79 is exactly 12. So that would mean 9.48 divided by 0.79 is 12. So I can buy 12 cans.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Because 12 cans at 0.79 each would be 12 * 0.79. Let's compute that. 10 cans would be 7.90, and 2 cans would be 1.58. So 7.90 + 1.58 = 9.48. Yes, that adds up perfectly. So 12 cans cost exactly $9.48.

Looking at the options, option C is 12 cans. So the answer should be C.

The cost per can of pears is $0.79. Dividing $9.48 by $0.79 gives exactly 12 cans. 

Answer: C
