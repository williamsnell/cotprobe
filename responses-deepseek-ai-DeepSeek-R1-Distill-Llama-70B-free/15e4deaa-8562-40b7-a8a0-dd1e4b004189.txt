The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A retailer brought a federal diversity action against a wholesaler, alleging breach of contract and fraudulent misrepresentation. After the parties presented their evidence at trial, the court instructed the jury on the law. Neither party filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law before the case went to the jury. The jury found for the retailer on both claims. After the court entered judgment on the verdict, the wholesaler moved for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict on either claim. The court acknowledged that there had been problems with some of the evidence, but it denied the motions. The wholesaler appealed, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. Should the appellate court consider the wholesaler's challenge?

Options:

A: No, because the wholesaler's challenge is merely a disagreement with the jury's verdict, not a legal issue for the appellate court.
B: Yes, because the wholesaler's challenge pertains to a fundamental aspect of the trial process.
C: Yes, because the wholesaler has the right to appeal the trial court's decisions.
D: No, because the wholesaler did not raise the sufficiency-of-the-evidence issue in a motion for judgment as a matter of law before the case went to the jury.
E: Yes, because the challenge was raised and ruled on by the trial court before the wholesaler filed the appeal.
F: Yes, because the appellate court has the power to review all aspects of the case, including the sufficiency of the evidence.
G: No, because a determination of the sufficiency of the evidence is solely within sufficiency of the evidence is solely within the jury's province.
H: Yes, because, as the trial court acknowledged, the wholesaler has strong arguments on the challenge.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about federal civil procedure, specifically dealing with motions and appeals. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question involves a retailer suing a wholesaler for breach of contract and fraudulent misrepresentation. They went to trial, and the jury found for the retailer on both claims. After the judgment was entered, the wholesaler moved for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law, arguing that the evidence wasn't sufficient. The court denied these motions, and now the wholesaler is appealing, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence.

The key issue here is whether the appellate court will consider the wholesaler's challenge. The options given range from A to H, and I need to choose the correct one.

I remember that in federal court, there's a specific procedure for challenging the sufficiency of evidence. When a party wants to argue that the evidence isn't enough to support a verdict, they can file a motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL). There are two times this can be done: before the case goes to the jury (under Rule 50(a)) and after the verdict (under Rule 50(b)). 

If a party doesn't make a Rule 50(a) motion before the jury decides, they can still file a Rule 50(b) motion after the verdict, but only if they first made a Rule 50(a) motion. Wait, no, actually, I think that's not entirely accurate. Let me think again. Rule 50(b) allows a party to renew a motion for JMOL after the verdict if they moved for it under Rule 50(a) before the case was submitted to the jury. So if they didn't move under 50(a), they can't move under 50(b). Or is it that they can still move under 50(b) even if they didn't move under 50(a), but the standard is different?

Wait, no, I think the rule is that to preserve the issue for appeal, the party must have made a Rule 50(a) motion before the case went to the jury. If they didn't, then they can't raise the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, except in cases where the evidence is so lacking that the issue can be raised for the first time on appeal. But that's a very high bar, like when there's a complete absence of evidence on an essential element.

In this question, the wholesaler didn't file a motion for judgment as a matter of law before the case went to the jury. So they didn't make a Rule 50(a) motion. After the verdict, they moved for a new trial and for JMOL under Rule 50(b). But since they didn't make the initial motion before the jury, they might not be able to challenge the sufficiency on appeal.

Looking at the options, option D says no because the wholesaler didn't raise the sufficiency issue in a motion before the case went to the jury. That sounds correct because without the Rule 50(a) motion, the appellate court can't review the sufficiency unless it's a fundamental issue, but I don't think that applies here.

Option E says yes because the challenge was raised and ruled on by the trial court. But even if the trial court denied it, the appellate court might not consider it if the initial motion wasn't made.

So the correct answer should be D because the wholesaler failed to make the timely motion under Rule 50(a), so the appellate court won't consider the sufficiency challenge.

The correct answer is D. The wholesaler failed to file a motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) before the case went to the jury, which is necessary to preserve the issue of sufficiency of the evidence for appellate review. Without this, the appellate court cannot consider the challenge unless exceptional circumstances apply, which are not present here.

D
