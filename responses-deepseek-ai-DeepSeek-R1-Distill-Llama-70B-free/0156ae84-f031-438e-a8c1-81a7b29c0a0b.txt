Question:

The village of Lynbrook has a capital budget of $125,626.79 for the current year. Through fines and issuing of licenses, the village expects to raise $4,256.30. If the total assessed valuation of the property in Lynbrook is $2,697,112, what is the town's tax rate in dollars per $1,000?

Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the tax rate for the village of Lynbrook. Hmm, let me see. I think I remember that the tax rate is usually calculated by dividing the total amount needed by the assessed valuation, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me break it down step by step.

The village has a capital budget of $125,626.79. That's the total amount they need to spend, right? But wait, they also expect to raise some money through fines and licenses, which is $4,256.30. So I guess that means they don't need to get all the money from taxes. So the amount they need from taxes would be the budget minus the money they'll get from other sources.

So the tax levy would be budget minus other revenues. Let me do that calculation. $125,626.79 minus $4,256.30. Let me subtract that. 125,626.79 - 4,256.30... Let's see, 125,626 minus 4,256 is 121,370. Then the .79 minus .30 is .49. So the total is $121,370.49. Wait, did I do that right? Let me check. 125,626.79 minus 4,256.30. Yeah, that gives 121,370.49.

Now, the total assessed valuation is $2,697,112. So the tax rate per $1,000 would be the tax levy divided by the assessed valuation, then multiplied by 1,000. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, the tax rate is usually calculated as (tax levy / assessed valuation) * 1000 to get dollars per thousand.

So let's compute that. The tax levy is $121,370.49. Divide that by the assessed valuation of $2,697,112. Let me write that out: 121,370.49 / 2,697,112.

Hmm, let me do this division. Maybe I can approximate. Let's see, 2,697,112 goes into 121,370.49 how many times? Well, 2,697,112 is about 2.7 million. 121,370 is about 0.12 million. So 0.12 / 2.7 is approximately 0.0444. So about 0.0444 in thousands.

Wait, but wait, the tax rate is in dollars per $1,000. So that would be the result multiplied by 1,000? No, wait no. Because the tax rate is per $1,000, so the calculation is (tax levy / assessed value) * 1,000. Let me correct that.

So 121,370.49 divided by 2,697,112 equals approximately 0.04498. Multiply that by 1,000 gives about 44.98 dollars per thousand. So around $45 per $1,000.

Looking at the options, option F is $45. So the answer should be F.

Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me compute 121,370.49 ÷ 2,697,112.

Let me use a calculator approach. 2,697,112 × 0.045 equals how much? 0.045 times 2,697,112 is 121,370. 0.045 × 2,697,112 = let's see, 2,697,112 × 0.04 is 107,884.48, and 2,697,112 × 0.005 is 13,485.56. Adding them together: 107,884.48 + 13,485.56 = 121,370.04. Oh wait, that's almost exactly the tax levy I calculated earlier, which was 121,370.49. So the tax rate is exactly $0.045 per dollar of assessed value, which is $45 per $1,000. So yes, option F is correct.

To calculate the tax rate for the village of Lynbrook, we first determine the amount of money the village needs to raise through taxes. The capital budget is $125,626.79, and the village expects to raise $4,256.30 through fines and licenses. Therefore, the tax levy is:

\[
\text{Tax Levy} = \$125,626.79 - \$4,256.30 = \$121,370.49
\]

Next, the tax rate is calculated by dividing the tax levy by the total assessed valuation of the property, which is $2,697,112, and then multiplying by 1,000 to express the rate in dollars per $1,000 of assessed valuation:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = \left( \frac{\$121,370.49}{\$2,697,112} \right) \times 1,000
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{121,370.49}{2,697,112} \approx 0.04498
\]

Multiplying by 1,000 gives:

\[
0.04498 \times 1,000 \approx 44.98 \, \text{dollars per \$1,000}
\]

This rounds to approximately $45 per $1,000 of assessed valuation. Comparing this result to the provided options, the correct answer is:

**F: $45 per $1,000 of assessed valuation**

Answer: F
