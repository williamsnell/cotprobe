Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about calculating the equilibrium constant Kp for a given chemical reaction. 

The reaction is S(s) + 2CO(g) → SO₂(g) + 2C(s). Hmm, I remember that when dealing with solids, their concentrations (or partial pressures) don't affect the equilibrium expression because they are constants. So I think that in the Kp expression, only the gaseous substances are considered.

The problem says that two atmospheres of CO are introduced into a vessel containing excess solid sulfur. The final equilibrium pressure is 1.03 atm. Wait, so initially, the pressure of CO is 2 atm, and then when the system reaches equilibrium, the total pressure is 1.03 atm. But wait, how does that work? Because in the reaction, CO is a reactant and SO₂ is a product. So some of the CO must have reacted to form SO₂.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Initially, before the reaction starts, the vessel has excess S (solid), so the only gaseous species present is CO at 2 atm. At equilibrium, the pressure is 1.03 atm. So the total pressure drops from 2 atm to 1.03 atm. That suggests that some of the CO has been consumed and perhaps some SO₂ has been produced.

Let me set up an ICE table to model the changes. ICE stands for Initial, Change, Equilibrium.

Since S and C are solids, their amounts don't change, so I can ignore them in the Kp expression.

The initial pressure of CO is 2 atm. For SO₂, initially it's zero because nothing has reacted yet.

Let’s let the change in CO be a decrease of 2x atm because the stoichiometry of the reaction shows that 2 moles of CO are consumed for every 1 mole of SO₂ produced. So, for every x moles of SO₂ produced, 2x moles of CO are consumed.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The reaction is 2 moles of CO reacting to produce 1 mole of SO₂. So if the change in CO is -2x, then the change in SO₂ would be +x.

So the initial pressures are: CO = 2 atm, SO₂ = 0.

Change: CO decreases by 2x, SO₂ increases by x.

At equilibrium: CO = 2 - 2x, SO₂ = x.

But wait, the total pressure at equilibrium is given as 1.03 atm. The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of CO and SO₂. Because solids don't contribute to pressure.

So total pressure = (2 - 2x) + x = 2 - x.

And this is equal to 1.03 atm. So 2 - x = 1.03 → x = 2 - 1.03 → x = 0.97 atm.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Because if x is 0.97, then CO would be 2 - 2*(0.97) = 2 - 1.94 = 0.06 atm. And SO₂ would be 0.97 atm.

Wait, but then the sum is 0.06 + 0.97 = 1.03 atm, which matches the given. So that's correct.

Now, I can plug these into the Kp expression. The reaction is S(s) + 2CO(g) → SO₂(g) + 2C(s). So the Kp expression will be Kp = (P_SO2) / (P_CO)^2.

Because the solids S and C are present in excess, their activities are taken as 1 and thus don't appear in the expression.

So substituting the equilibrium pressures: Kp = (0.97) / (0.06)^2.

Let me compute that. 0.06 squared is 0.0036. Then 0.97 divided by 0.0036 is approximately 269.44.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. 0.97 divided by 0.0036:

0.97 / 0.0036 = ?

Well, 0.0036 is 36e-4. 0.97 is 97e-2. So 97e-2 / 36e-4 = (97/36) * (1e-2 / 1e-4) → (2.6944) * 100 = 269.44.

So Kp would be approximately 269.44 atm^-1.

Looking at the options, option J is 269.44 atm^-1.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the ICE table. So initial CO is 2 atm. At equilibrium, CO is 0.06 atm and SO₂ is 0.97. That's correct because 0.06 + 0.97 = 1.03 atm, matching the given.

So Kp = 0.97 / (0.06)^2 = 0.97 / 0.0036 = 269.44.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option J.

To calculate the equilibrium constant \( K_p \) for the reaction:

\[
S(s) + 2\text{CO}(g) \rightarrow \text{SO}_2(g) + 2\text{C}(s),
\]

we start by noting that the equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_p = \frac{P_{\text{SO}_2}}{P_{\text{CO}}^2}.
\]

Since solids do not appear in the equilibrium expression, we only consider the gaseous species.

### Step 1: Initial and equilibrium pressures
Initially, the pressure of CO is 2 atm, and the pressure of SO₂ is 0 atm. Let the change in CO pressure be \(-2x\), and the change in SO₂ pressure be \(+x\), based on the stoichiometry of the reaction. At equilibrium:

\[
P_{\text{CO}} = 2 - 2x, \quad P_{\text{SO}_2} = x.
\]

The total pressure at equilibrium is given as 1.03 atm. Since the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of CO and SO₂:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{CO}} + P_{\text{SO}_2} = (2 - 2x) + x = 2 - x.
\]

Setting \( P_{\text{total}} = 1.03 \, \text{atm} \):

\[
2 - x = 1.03 \implies x = 0.97 \, \text{atm}.
\]

### Step 2: Equilibrium pressures
Substituting \( x = 0.97 \, \text{atm} \):

\[
P_{\text{CO}} = 2 - 2(0.97) = 0.06 \, \text{atm}, \quad P_{\text{SO}_2} = 0.97 \, \text{atm}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( K_p \)
Using the equilibrium pressures in the expression for \( K_p \):

\[
K_p = \frac{P_{\text{SO}_2}}{P_{\text{CO}}^2} = \frac{0.97}{(0.06)^2}.
\]

First, calculate \( (0.06)^2 \):

\[
(0.06)^2 = 0.0036.
\]

Then, divide:

\[
K_p = \frac{0.97}{0.0036} = 269.44 \, \text{atm}^{-1}.
\]

### Final Answer:
Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**J: 269.44 atm\(^{-1}\).**
