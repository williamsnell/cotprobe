Question:

A partnership conveyed a general warranty deed representing a vacant parcel of land to the purchaser. In the deed, the grantee and her assigns were required by covenant to share proportionately in the paving of a road that abutted the property. The grantee conveyed the property to a married couple by special warranty deed that did not contain any of the conditions of the covenant regarding paving the new road. The buyers did not have an attorney and did not do a title search. When the road was completed, the married couple buyers refused to pay the share that was demanded of them. The original sellers of the parcel sued the couple in an equity claim without a jury. The judge ruled that the couple had to pay their share of the paving. On appeal, will the appellate court affirm the trial judge's order?

Options:

A: No, because the couple were not aware of the covenant due to not having a lawyer and not conducting a title search.
B: No, because the general warranty of the original sellers did not apply beyond the first purchaser.
C: Yes, because a landowner is in any event responsible for her share of improvements to any abutting private roads.
D: Yes, this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and "assigns".
E: Yes, because the covenant was part of the original agreement and therefore applies to all subsequent owners.
F: Yes, because the couple should have conducted a title search to understand the obligations associated with the property.
G: No, because the sellers did not explicitly communicate the covenant to the couple.
H: Yes, because the couple should have hired an attorney to understand the obligations of the property.
I: No, because the special warranty deed given to the couple did not include any obligations related to the paving of the road.
J: No, because the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the married couple and it was not.

Okay, so I have this real property law question here about covenants running with the land. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

So, the setup is that a partnership sold a vacant parcel using a general warranty deed. In that deed, there's a covenant that requires the grantee and their assigns to share in paving a road that's next to the property. Then, the grantee sells it to a married couple using a special warranty deed, and that deed doesn't mention the paving covenant at all. The couple didn't use an attorney or do a title search, and now they're refusing to pay their share when the road was done. The original sellers sued, and the judge said they have to pay. The question is whether the appellate court will affirm that decision.

Alright, I remember that covenants can run with the land, meaning they bind future owners. But for that to happen, certain conditions must be met. I think the main points are that the covenant must "touch and concern" the land, it should be in writing, and the subsequent purchasers must have notice, either actual or constructive.

In this case, the original deed had the covenant. The grantee (first buyer) then sold it to the couple without including the covenant in their deed. But wait, the original deed's covenant requires the grantee and their assigns to share in paving. So the covenant is supposed to bind future owners, right?

But the couple didn't have notice. They didn't do a title search or hire an attorney. However, in real property, constructive notice can come from the prior deeds. So if the covenant is in the chain of title, then the couple might be deemed to have constructive notice, regardless of whether they actually knew about it.

Wait, but the second deed (special warranty) didn't include the covenant. So does that affect the enforceability against the couple? Or is the covenant from the original deed still binding because it's in the chain of title?

Also, the type of warranty deed might matter. A general warranty deed warrants against all prior defects, while a special warranty only covers defects that arose during the grantor's ownership. But the covenant here isn't a defect; it's a contractual obligation. So maybe the warranty type isn't directly relevant here.

Another point: for a covenant to run with the land at common law, it has to meet the horizontal privity (original parties must have some current property interest) and vertical privity (succession of interest). It also must touch and concern the land, benefitting the land, not just a personal obligation.

In the original deed, the covenant was that the grantee and assigns would share in paving. So, the original grantee is bound, and so are their assigns. So when the grantee sold to the couple, the covenant should still apply if it runs with the land.

So the couple, as subsequent purchasers, would be subject to the covenant if they had notice. Since the covenant was in the prior deed, they are charged with constructive notice, even if they didn't do a title search. So the appellate court would likely affirm because the covenant runs with the land and the couple is bound by it.

Looking at the options:

Option D says yes because it's a covenant running with the land intended to apply to assigns. That fits because the original covenant was intended to bind assigns.

Option E says yes because it's part of the original agreement. But that's a bit vague. More precise is option D.

Option I says no because the special warranty didn't include the covenant. But the covenant comes from the original deed, not the later one. So the absence in the special warranty doesn't matter because the covenant was already in the chain.

Option J says it's not in the couple's deed, so no. But that's not correct because the covenant runs from the original deed, and the couple is in the chain of title.

So the correct answer should be D or E. Wait, I'm a bit confused between them. D says it's a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to heirs and assigns. E says it's part of the original agreement and applies to all subsequent owners.

But the key is whether the covenant runs with the land. Since it's in the original deed and touches and concerns the land, and the grantee's assigns are bound, the covenant runs. So the appellate court would affirm, making D correct.

Wait, but the couple had a special warranty deed without the covenant. Does that matter? No, because the covenant is from the prior deed, and it's a burden on the land regardless of the subsequent deed's terms. So the couple is still bound by the original covenant because it's in the chain of title.

So I think the answer is D.

The question revolves around whether a covenant to share in the cost of paving a road, included in a general warranty deed, binds subsequent purchasers who did not have actual knowledge of the covenant and whose special warranty deed did not mention it. For a covenant to run with the land, it must meet specific criteria: it must "touch and concern" the land, be in writing, and subsequent purchasers must have notice (actual or constructive). 

In this case, the original deed included the covenant, which was intended to bind the grantee and their assigns. This satisfies the requirement that the covenant was meant to run with the land. The couple, as subsequent purchasers, are deemed to have constructive notice of the covenant because it was part of the chain of title, even though they did not conduct a title search or include the covenant in their special warranty deed. The type of warranty deed (general or special) does not affect the enforceability of the covenant in this context, as the covenant is a contractual obligation that burdens the land.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option D** correctly identifies that the covenant runs with the land because it was intended to apply to the grantee's heirs and assigns, satisfying the requirements for a covenant to run with the land.
- **Option E** is less precise, as it broadly states that the covenant applies to all subsequent owners without emphasizing the specific legal basis of covenants running with the land.
- **Option I** and **Option J** are incorrect because the absence of the covenant in the special warranty deed does not negate its enforceability, as it is part of the chain of title from the original deed.

Thus, the appellate court is likely to affirm the trial judge's order because the covenant runs with the land and binds the subsequent purchasers.
