Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about fluid flow. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with fluids, especially ideal fluids, the continuity equation comes into play. The continuity equation states that the flow rate must remain constant throughout the pipe, assuming the fluid is incompressible and the flow is steady.

So the problem says the pipe has a radius Q and a flow speed V. Then it splits into three separate paths, each with radius Q/2. I need to find the new flow speed in each of these paths.

Wait, right, the continuity equation is A1V1 = A2V2. But wait, in this case, the pipe splits into three, so the total area after splitting is three times the area of each smaller pipe. Let me think about that.

Let me break it down step by step. First, calculate the cross-sectional area before and after the split. The initial area A_initial is πQ² since the radius is Q. Then, each of the three paths has a radius of Q/2, so the area of one path is π(Q/2)². Since there are three such paths, the total area after splitting is 3 * π(Q²/4) = (3πQ²)/4.

Wait no, wait. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. The continuity equation says the total flow rate before equals the total after. So A_initial * V_initial = A_final * V_final. But A_final here is the sum of the three areas. So each path has radius Q/2, so each has area π(Q/2)^2 = π Q² /4. Since there are three, total area A_final = 3*(π Q² /4) = 3π Q²/4.

Wait, the initial area is π Q². So initial flow rate is A_initial * V = π Q² * V.

The final flow rate is A_final * V_final, where V_final is the speed in each of the three paths. So:

π Q² V = (3π Q²/4) * V_final.

Wait, so solving for V_final. Let's see:

Divide both sides by (3π Q²/4):

V_final = (π Q² V) / (3π Q² /4) ) = (V) * (4/3) = (4/3)V.

So each path has a speed of 4/3 V. Looking at the options, option A is 4/3 V. So the answer should be A.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, wait. No, that can't be right. Because if the cross-sectional area increases, the speed should decrease, right? Because the same flow rate has to go through a larger area. Wait, in this case, the initial area is π Q², and the final area is 3*(π (Q/2)^2 )= 3*(π Q²/4) )= 3π Q²/4. So 3π Q²/4 is less than π Q² because 3/4 is less than 1. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 3/4 is less than 1. So the final area is smaller than the initial area. That means the speed has to increase. Because if area decreases, speed increases.

Wait, let me double-check the areas. Initial area is π Q².

Each small pipe has radius Q/2, so area is π (Q/2)^2 = π Q²/4. So three of them would have a combined area of 3*(π Q²/4) )= 3π Q²/4. So 3/4 π Q². So 3/4 is less than 1, meaning the total area is smaller than before. So the fluid is moving through a smaller area, which means the speed must increase.

So according to the equation, V_final = (A_initial / A_final) * V_initial.

A_initial is π Q², A_final is (3/4) π Q². So ratio is (π Q²) / ( (3/4) π Q² ) )= 4/3. So V_final = (4/3)V. So that's option A.

So the flow speed in each path is 4/3 times the original speed. So the correct answer is A.

To solve the problem, we use the continuity equation, which states that the flow rate remains constant in an ideal fluid. The flow rate is given by \( A_1 V_1 = A_2 V_2 \), where \( A \) is the cross-sectional area and \( V \) is the flow speed.

1. **Initial Setup**:  
   - The initial pipe has radius \( Q \), so its cross-sectional area is \( A_{\text{initial}} = \pi Q^2 \).  
   - The flow speed in the initial pipe is \( V_{\text{initial}} = V \).  

2. **Final Setup**:  
   - After the pipe splits, there are three separate paths, each with radius \( Q/2 \).  
   - The cross-sectional area of one path is \( A_{\text{path}} = \pi (Q/2)^2 = \pi Q^2 / 4 \).  
   - Since there are three paths, the total cross-sectional area is \( A_{\text{final}} = 3 \cdot (\pi Q^2 / 4) = 3\pi Q^2 / 4 \).  

3. **Applying the Continuity Equation**:  
   Using \( A_{\text{initial}} V_{\text{initial}} = A_{\text{final}} V_{\text{final}} \), we solve for \( V_{\text{final}} \):  
   \[
   V_{\text{final}} = \frac{A_{\text{initial}}}{A_{\text{final}}} V_{\text{initial}}
   \]  
   Substituting the areas:  
   \[
   V_{\text{final}} = \frac{\pi Q^2}{3\pi Q^2 / 4} V = \frac{4}{3} V
   \]  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The flow speed through each of the three paths is \( \frac{4}{3} V \). This corresponds to option **A**.
