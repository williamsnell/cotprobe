Okay, so I have this question about Uncle Sam's goatee color. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to think it through. Uncle Sam is a famous symbol for the United States, right? I remember seeing him in cartoons and posters, especially the "I Want You" recruitment posters from World War I and II.

Wait, in those posters, Uncle Sam is usually depicted as an older man with a white beard and hair. I think the goatee is that small beard under his chin. So, if his hair is white, his goatee probably is too. But wait, I'm not 100% certain. Maybe it's possible that sometimes he's drawn with a different color? I don't recall seeing any variations, though. Most representations I've seen have him with white hair, so the goatee should match.

Looking at the options, E is white and J is silver. Silver is kind of similar to white, but I think white is more accurate. I don't think I've ever seen Uncle Sam with a silver goatee; it's usually white. So I'll go with option E: white.
