Okay, so I have this question about contract law, specifically regarding offers and acceptances. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The scenario is that James makes a written offer to Fred for the sale of land at $100,000. The offer says it's not revocable for a ten-day period. Important details: the offer was signed on April 1, mailed on April 3, and Fred received it on April 5.

I remember that when an offer is made, the time when it's effective can depend on when it's received. Also, the method of mailing might affect when the offer is considered communicated. But wait, the offer is written, so that might affect how revocation works.

So the key points here are about when the offer becomes irrevocable and how long it's open. The offer states a ten-day period where it's not revocable. Wait, when does that ten-day period start? Typically, an offer is open for acceptance from the time it's received by the offeree. So if Fred got it on April 5, the ten days would start then. So the offer should be open until April 15 (since April 5 + 10 days is April 15). But wait, sometimes it's calculated as including the start day. So April 5 is day 1, then day 10 would be April 14. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should check that.

Wait, the offer was signed on April 1, but mailed on April 3 and received on April 5. So the offer is effective when received, right? So the ten-day period starts on April 5. So the offer is open until April 15 (assuming "ten days" includes the starting day as day 1). Or wait, sometimes people count the next day as day 1. So if April 5 is day 0, then day 1 is April 6. Then ten days would end on April 15. Hmm, maybe I should think about it as April 5 plus ten days is April 15.

But wait, the question is about what happens if James dies before Fred accepts. The options mention James dying on April 4. Wait, but the offer was received by Fred on April 5. So if James dies on April 4, which is before Fred even received the offer, does that affect the offer?

Wait, the offer is irrevocable for ten days. So the offer can't be revoked once it's made. But what if the offeror dies before the offeree receives the offer? Because the offer is made when it's communicated. So when the offer is mailed, is it considered effective when sent or when received? I think under the mailbox rule, an offer is effective when sent, but revocation is effective when received. Wait, no, revocation is effective upon communication. So if James mails the offer on April 3, it's an offer from April 3, but Fred receives it on April 5. If James dies on April 4, which is after the offer was sent but before it was received, can the offer still be accepted?

Wait, but the offer is written and states it's not revocable for ten days. So under the UCC or common law? Wait, this is about the sale of land, which is a service (real property), so common law applies. Under common law, offers are revocable unless there's consideration for the irrevocability, like an option. But here, the offer itself states it's not revocable for ten days. So this might be an option contract created without consideration, which is allowed in some cases. Wait, I think the modern approach allows an offer to include a promised period of irrevocability without needing consideration. So yes, the offer is irrevocable for ten days starting from when?

So if the offer is made on April 3 when mailed, but received on April 5, when does the ten-day period start? Is it from when James sent it, or when Fred received it? Because the offer is part of a written document, perhaps the ten days start when the offer is received by Fred. Because until Fred gets it, he can't accept it. So the ten days would run from April 5. So the offer is open until April 15.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Fred's acceptance on April 5 will not create a contract if James dies on April 4.

Wait, James died on April 4, before Fred received the offer on April 5. But the offer was mailed on April 3, so the offer was made on April 3. If James dies before the offer is received, does that affect the offer's validity? Because the offer was already made (mailed) on April 3. So if Fred accepts on April 5, which is within the ten-day period (from April 5 to April 15), then the acceptance would be valid, even if James died before. Because the offer was already effective when mailed, but the irrevocable period starts upon receipt. Wait, no, the offer's irrevocability is for a ten-day period from when? If the offer is made on April 3, and says ten days, then the offer is open until April 13 (April 3 + 10 days). But wait, the offer was not received until April 5. So perhaps the ten days run from when Fred receives it. So the offer is open until April 15.

So if James dies on April 4, which is before Fred receives the offer on April 5, but after the offer was sent, could Fred still accept it? Because the offer was made and is irrevocable for ten days starting from when it's received. So the offer is effective, and James's death doesn't revoke it because the offer is irrevocable during that period. So if Fred accepts on April 5, that's within the ten-day period, so a contract is formed. So option A says that Fred's acceptance on April 5 won't create a contract if James dies on April 4. So according to my reasoning, that's incorrect. So option A is false.

Option B: Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 10 won't create a contract. Wait, April 10 is within the ten-day period (April 5 to April 15). So if Fred accepts on April 10, which is within the period, then a contract is formed. So option B is saying it won't create a contract, which would be incorrect. So B is false.

Option C: Fred's acceptance on April 5 with a counteroffer (paying $90k) creates a contract. No, that's a counteroffer, which would reject the original offer and terminate it. So no contract is formed. So C is false.

Option D: Fred's acceptance on April 11 creates a contract. April 11 is within the ten-day period (if the period is April 5 to April 15). So yes, contract is formed. So D is true. But let me check the other options.

Option E: Fred says he'll pay in 60 days. That's a qualification. So unless the offer allows for it, that's a counteroffer. So no contract. So E is false.

Option F: James revokes the offer on April 4, which is before Fred received it on April 5. Since the offer is irrevocable for ten days, can James revoke it? Wait, the offer is written and says it's not revocable for ten days. So even if James tried to revoke on April 4, which is before Fred received the offer, that revocation would be ineffective because the offer is irrevocable once it's effective. But when does the irrevocability start? If the offer is effective upon mailing (April 3), then the ten days would run from April 3. So if James revokes on April 4, that's within the ten days, so the revocation is ineffective. So the offer remains open, and Fred can accept up to April 13 (April 3 + 10). But wait, if the ten days run from when Fred receives it on April 5, then the offer is irrevocable from April 5 to April 15. So James's revocation on April 4 would be before the irrevocability period, so it's effective. Because the offer is only irrevocable once the ten-day period starts.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The offer is made on April 3 (mailed). The offer says it's not revocable for ten days. So the irrevocability period starts when? Is it when the offer is made (April 3) or when it's received (April 5)? 

In general, the offer's terms dictate when the irrevocability starts. The offer says "this offer will not be revocable for a ten-day period of time." Without more specifics, it's likely that the period starts when the offer is made, i.e., when it's sent. Because the offeror (James) is making the promise. So the offer is effective on April 3, and the ten-day period runs from then, making the offer open until April 13. If James revokes on April 4, that's within the ten days, so revocation is ineffective. So the offer remains open, and Fred can accept until April 13. But in this case, Fred received the offer on April 5. So if Fred accepts on April 5, that's within the period (since the period started on April 3). So if James revokes on April 4, that revocation is ineffective, so the offer is still open. So if Fred accepts on April 5, the contract is formed. Therefore, option F says that James revoking on April 4 invalidates the contract. But according to this, the revocation is ineffective, so the contract would still be formed if Fred accepts. Therefore, F is false.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Another approach: under common law, an offer can be revoked any time before acceptance, unless it's an option. But in this case, the offer itself states it's not revocable for ten days. So James is estopped from revoking during that period. So if James revokes on April 4, which is during the ten-day period (assuming the period starts on April 3), then the revocation is ineffective. So the offer remains open, and Fred can accept. So option F says that James revoking on April 4 would invalidate the contract. But that's not true because the revocation is ineffective. So F is false.

So going back to the options, the correct answer seems to be D. Let me confirm the other options again.

Option A: Fred accepts on April 5, James died on April 4. So the offer is still open because it's irrevocable for ten days from April 3 to April 13. Fred's acceptance on April 5 is within that period, so the contract is formed. So A says it won't create a contract, which is incorrect. So A is wrong.

Option B: Acceptance on April 10 is within the period, so contract is formed. B says it won't, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Counteroffer, so no contract. C is wrong.

Option D: April 11 is within the period (if period is April 5 to 15). Wait, wait. Maybe I got the period wrong. If the offer is received on April 5, and the ten-day period starts then, then the period is April 5 to April 14 (since day 1 is April 5, day 10 is April 14). So April 11 is within that period, so acceptance then is valid. So D is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought the period starts on April 3, but now considering that the offer is received on April 5, maybe the ten days run from then. So the period would be April 5 to April 14. So for option D, April 11 is within that, so contract is formed. So D is correct.

So the answer is D.

The question revolves around contract law principles, specifically the irrevocability of an offer and the timing of acceptance. James makes a written offer to Fred for the sale of land, stating that the offer is not revocable for a ten-day period. The offer was signed on April 1, mailed on April 3, and received by Fred on April 5. The key issue is determining when the ten-day irrevocability period begins and whether Fred's acceptance or James's actions (such as revocation or death) affect the contract's formation.

### Key Analysis:
1. **When Does the Ten-Day Period Start?**  
   The offer is written and states it is not revocable for ten days. Under common law, the irrevocability period typically begins when the offer is received by the offeree (Fred). Therefore, the ten-day period starts on April 5 (when Fred receives the offer) and ends on April 14 (day 10 of the period).

2. **Option A:**  
   Fred's acceptance on April 5 occurs within the ten-day period. Even if James dies on April 4 (before Fred receives the offer), the offer remains effective because it is irrevocable for ten days starting from April 5. Thus, Fred's acceptance on April 5 creates a contract. Option A is **incorrect**.

3. **Option B:**  
   Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 10 is within the ten-day period (April 5 to April 14). Therefore, the acceptance creates a contract. Option B is **incorrect**.

4. **Option C:**  
   Fred's statement on April 5, "I accept your offer, but will pay only $90,000," is a counteroffer, not an unqualified acceptance. A counteroffer rejects the original offer and does not create a contract. Option C is **incorrect**.

5. **Option D:**  
   Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 11 is within the ten-day period (April 5 to April 14). Therefore, the acceptance creates a contract. Option D is **correct**.

6. **Option E:**  
   Fred's statement on April 6, "I accept your offer, but will pay in 60 days," is a qualified acceptance. It deviates from the terms of the offer and constitutes a counteroffer, which does not create a contract. Option E is **incorrect**.

7. **Option F:**  
   If James revokes the offer on April 4, this occurs before the ten-day irrevocability period begins (April 5). However, the offer is explicitly stated to be irrevocable for ten days, and James's revocation on April 4 is ineffective because the irrevocability period has already begun. Therefore, Fred can still accept the offer, and the contract would be valid. Option F is **incorrect**.

### Conclusion:  
The correct answer is **D**, as Fred's unqualified acceptance on April 11 falls within the ten-day irrevocability period and creates a contract.
