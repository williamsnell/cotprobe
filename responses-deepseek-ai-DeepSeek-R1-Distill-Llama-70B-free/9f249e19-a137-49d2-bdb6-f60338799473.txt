Question:

Walking down a street late at night, an adult male pedestrian notices a young female on the ground, not moving. The female is on the opposite side of the street. Crossing the street, the pedestrian notices that the young woman appears both much wealthier than he is and is of a different ethnicity. Seeing no one else present, the pedestrian renders aid. According to the bystander effect, which of the following would change how the pedestrian reacts?

Options:

A: The presence of a security camera on the street
B: The presence of one other person who is already approaching the girl
C: The person requiring aid appearing to be of a lower socioeconomic class rather than a higher one
D: The presence of a large, intimidating dog near the girl
E: The person requiring aid appearing to be the same ethnicity rather than a different one
F: The person requiring aid appearing to be less wealthy than initially thought
G: The person requiring aid appearing to be older rather than younger
H: The person requiring aid appearing to be of the same gender rather than a different one

Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this psychology question about the bystander effect. Let me start by recalling what the bystander effect is. From what I remember, the bystander effect is the phenomenon where individuals are less likely to help someone in distress when there are other people around. The more people present, the less likely each person is to provide assistance because the responsibility is diffused among everyone.

The question describes a scenario where a male pedestrian sees a young woman on the ground who's not moving. She's across the street, wealthier, and of a different ethnicity. He decides to help even though she's different in some ways. The options ask which change would affect how he reacts according to the bystander effect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Presence of a security camera. Hmm, a camera might make someone feel watched, so maybe they're more likely to help because they know they're being recorded. But I'm not sure how this ties into the bystander effect specifically. The bystander effect is more about the presence of other people, not cameras.

Option B: Another person approaching. Wait, if someone else is already helping, that might change things. If the pedestrian sees another person helping, maybe he thinks someone else has it covered, so he doesn't need to help. But wait, in this case, he's alone. So if another person is approaching, that could either encourage him to help more because others are, but according to the bystander effect, when others are present, each individual feels less responsible. So if there's another person, he might be less likely to help because he assumes the other person will take care of it.

Option C: If she appears lower socioeconomic class. I'm not sure. The bystander effect is more about the number of people present, not the socioeconomic status. Unless it's about empathy or similarity. Wait, maybe if she's of a lower class, he might feel less connected, but the question is about the bystander effect, which is about diffusion of responsibility. So maybe this doesn't tie directly to the effect.

Option D: Intimidating dog nearby. That would probably make him less likely to help because of fear. But again, this doesn't directly relate to the bystander effect, which is about the presence of others.

Option E: Same ethnicity. If she's the same ethnicity, maybe he feels more connected and thus more likely to help. But this relates more to empathy or social identity theory, not the bystander effect.

Option F: Less wealthy. Similar to option C, this might affect his willingness based on perceived similarity, but not directly about the bystander effect.

Option G: Older rather than younger. Maybe he perceives her as needing more help, but again, not directly about the presence of others.

Option H: Same gender. He might feel more inclined to help someone of the same gender, but again, this is about personal connection rather than the bystander effect.

Wait, the question is about what would change his reaction according to the bystander effect. So the key here is the presence of other people. So the correct option should involve the presence of others affecting his decision.

In the scenario, the pedestrian is alone when he decides to help. So if another person were present (option B), that would change things. Let me think: if another person is already approaching, does that make him more or less likely to help? According to the bystander effect, when others are present, each individual feels less responsible. So if he sees someone else helping, he might think that someone else has already taken responsibility, so he doesn't need to. Therefore, the presence of another person approaching might reduce his likelihood to help. Wait, but in this case, he did help when he was alone. So the change would be if another person is present, he might not have helped as much.

Wait, the question says which change would affect how he reacts. So if option B is present (another person approaching), he might be less likely to help. But in the scenario, he did help when alone. So the presence of another person would reduce his helping, so that's a change.

Alternatively, if someone else is already helping, he might feel that he doesn't need to. So the presence of others can either increase or decrease the likelihood, depending on whether they're helping or not. If others are present and not helping, he might not help either. But if others are helping, maybe he's more likely to.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify the bystander effect. The classic study showed that when more people are present, individuals are less likely to help because the responsibility is spread out. So in the case where he is alone, he feels more responsible. If another person is present, he might feel less responsible and thus less likely to help.

In the given scenario, the pedestrian helped when he was alone. So if another person was present (option B), he might not have helped. So the presence of another person approaching would change his reactionâ€”he might not render aid.

So looking back at the options, option B is the presence of another person approaching. That would change his reaction because according to the bystander effect, more people present would lead to less likelihood of helping. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

The bystander effect refers to the phenomenon where individuals are less likely to help someone in distress when others are present, as the responsibility to act is diffused among the group. In the given scenario, the pedestrian decides to help the woman when he is alone, indicating a sense of personal responsibility. The question asks which factor would change his reaction according to the bystander effect.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A security camera might influence behavior due to being watched, but this is unrelated to the bystander effect, which focuses on the presence of others.
- **Option B**: If another person is already approaching, the pedestrian might feel less responsible, as the bystander effect predicts that the presence of others reduces the likelihood of individual intervention.
- **Option C**: Socioeconomic status might affect empathy but does not directly relate to the bystander effect.
- **Option D**: A large, intimidating dog could deter helping due to fear, but this is unrelated to the bystander effect.
- **Option E**: Ethnicity might influence empathy but does not directly tie to the bystander effect.
- **Option F**: Perceived wealth might affect willingness to help but is not a factor in the bystander effect.
- **Option G**: Age might influence perceived need for help but is unrelated to the bystander effect.
- **Option H**: Gender might affect personal connection but does not directly relate to the bystander effect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as the presence of another person approaching would reduce the pedestrian's sense of personal responsibility, aligning with the bystander effect.
