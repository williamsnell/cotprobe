Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is (2^20 + 2^20 + 2^20 + 2^21) divided by 2^17. And I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I should probably simplify the numerator before dealing with the division. So the numerator is 2^20 added three times and then adding 2^21 once. Wait, 2^20 appears three times, right? So that's like 3 times 2^20 plus 2^21.

Wait, maybe I can factor out 2^20 from all the terms. Let's see. So 3*(2^20) + 2^21. Oh wait, 2^21 is the same as 2^20 * 2, because 2^21 = 2^(20+1) = 2^20 * 2^1. So that makes it easier.

So substituting that in, the numerator becomes 3*(2^20) + 2*(2^20) because 2^21 is 2*2^20. Wait, no, wait. Let me check that again. Oh wait, 2^21 is 2^20 multiplied by 2, right? So yes, that's correct.

So combining the terms: 3*(2^20) + 2*(2^20) = (3+2)*(2^20) = 5*(2^20). Oh, that's a nice simplification. So the numerator simplifies to 5*(2^20).

Now, the problem is to divide this by 2^17. So the expression becomes (5 * 2^20) / 2^17.

I remember that when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract the exponents. So 2^20 divided by 2^17 is 2^(20-17) = 2^3. And 2^3 is 8.

So putting it all together, 5 * (2^20 / 2^17) = 5 * 8 = 40. Wait, that would make the answer 40. Let me check the options. Option C is 40, so that's probably the right choice.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let me go through each step again.

First, the numerator: 2^20 + 2^20 + 2^20 is indeed 3*2^20. Then plus 2^21, which is 2*2^20. So 3*2^20 + 2*2^20 = 5*2^20. That makes sense.

Then, dividing by 2^17: 2^20 / 2^17 is 2^(20-17) = 2^3 = 8. Multiply by 5, so 5*8=40. Yep, that seems correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So the answer should be 40, which is option C.

The problem requires simplifying the expression \((2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{21}) \div 2^{17}\). 

First, the numerator is simplified by combining like terms. Since \(2^{21} = 2 \cdot 2^{20}\), the numerator becomes:
\[
2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{21} = 3 \cdot 2^{20} + 2 \cdot 2^{20} = (3 + 2) \cdot 2^{20} = 5 \cdot 2^{20}.
\]

Next, the expression is divided by \(2^{17}\):
\[
\frac{5 \cdot 2^{20}}{2^{17}} = 5 \cdot \frac{2^{20}}{2^{17}} = 5 \cdot 2^{20-17} = 5 \cdot 2^3 = 5 \cdot 8 = 40.
\]

Thus, the final result is **40**, which corresponds to option **C**.
