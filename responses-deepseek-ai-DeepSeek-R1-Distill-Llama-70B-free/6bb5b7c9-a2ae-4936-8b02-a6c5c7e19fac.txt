Okay, so I've got this question here about the percentage of people in the United States who think homosexuality should be accepted by society as of 2019. The options are from A to J, each with different percentages. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that public opinion on homosexuality has been changing over the years. I think it's been increasing, with more people accepting it now than in the past. So I'm guessing the percentage is on the higher side.

I recall that in the early 2000s, maybe around 2000 or so, the acceptance was lower, like maybe around 50% or so. But as time went on, especially in the 2010s, there was a significant shift. More states legalized same-sex marriage, and the Supreme Court ruled in favor of it in 2015. So by 2019, I imagine the acceptance rate had gone up quite a bit.

I think I read somewhere that by 2019, a majority of Americans supported acceptance. Maybe it was over 60%. Wait, was it even higher? I think Pew Research Center does a lot of surveys on this. Let me try to remember their findings.

In 2019, I believe the Pew Research Center reported that a large majority, maybe around 70% or so, of Americans believed homosexuality should be accepted. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I might be mixing it up with another survey.

Wait, another possibility is that it's around 63% or so. I think I've heard numbers like 62% or 63% before. Let me think about the options given. Option B is 62%, and option G is 72%. So which is it?

I'm trying to remember if it was closer to 60% or 70%. I think the trend is that each year, the percentage increases by a few points. So if in 2015 it was maybe 55%, by 2019 it could have gone up to around 63%, which is B.

But wait, another thought: some surveys might show higher numbers. Maybe it's 72%, which is option G. Or is that more recent than 2019? Because I think in more recent years, like 2020 or 2021, the number has gone up to around 70% or more.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. In 2019, I think the Pew survey showed that 63% of Americans said homosexuality should be accepted. So that would be option B:62%. Or maybe it's 62. So 62% is B.

Alternatively, if it's 72%, that's G. But I'm not sure. I'm trying to recall if in 2019 it was already at 70%. Maybe I'm mixing up with other data points.

Another angle: I remember that in 2019, support for same-sex marriage was around 63%, which is similar to the question here. So perhaps the percentage for acceptance is similar. So 62% would make sense, which is option B.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the question is about same-sex marriage or just acceptance of homosexuality in society. I think the question is about acceptance in society, which is a broader concept. So maybe the percentage is higher than same-sex marriage support.

Wait, no, because same-sex marriage is a specific aspect. Acceptance in society is more general. So perhaps the numbers are similar but not exactly the same.

Alternatively, I've heard that as of 2019, about 71% of Americans believed that homosexuality should be accepted. So that would be 72%, which is option G.

But I'm not certain. I'm trying to think of the exact figure. I think it's more than 60%, but is it closer to 70%? Let me see.

Wait, I think in 2019, the Pew Research Center found that 71% of Americans aged 18-29 believed society should accept homosexuality. But overall, including all age groups, maybe it's a bit lower. Or perhaps it's higher.

Wait, no, I think the overall number is around 63%. Because when considering all age groups, older people might be less accepting. So maybe the overall figure is around 63%, which would be 62% as in option B.

Alternatively, maybe it's higher. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Another approach: looking at the options, B is 62%, G is72%. Which is more likely for 2019?

I think I've read that in 2019, the majority had crossed into the 60s, maybe 63%, which would make B a good option. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: in 2019, a Gallup poll found that 63% of Americans believed gay relations were morally acceptable. So that's similar to the question here, which is about acceptance. So 63% would be close to 62%, which is option B.

So putting it all together, I think the correct answer is B:62%.

As of 2019, the percentage of people in the United States who believed homosexuality should be accepted by society was around 62%. This aligns with data from sources like the Pew Research Center and Gallup polls, which indicated increasing acceptance over the years, particularly surpassing 60% by 2019. While some surveys suggested higher numbers closer to 70%, the most consistent figure for that year is approximately 62%.

Answer: B
