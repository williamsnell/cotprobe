The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Explain the term "psychosis" and the distinction between functionaland organic psychoses.

Options:

A: Psychosis is characterized by persistent happiness and clarity of thought
B: Psychosis is a minor mental disorder
C: Organic psychosis results from voluntary substance abuse, whereas functional psychosis is always congenital
D: Organic psychosis is typically induced by changes in the weather or climate
E: Organic psychosis is caused by psychological trauma
F: A psychosis is a severe mental disorder causing impaired thinking and emotion. Organic psychosis is caused by impaired brain functioning due to structural lesions or disease, while functional psychosis does not have any apparent pathological changes in the brain.
G: Functional psychosis is a form of psychosis that only occurs in older adults
H: Functional psychosis is caused by physical brain damage
I: Psychosis is a mild condition that improves without treatment
J: Functional psychosis is caused by infectious diseases, while organic psychosis is a result of genetic factors

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about psychosis and the difference between functional and organic psychoses. I'm a bit new to psychology, so I'll need to think this through carefully.

First, I remember that psychosis is a term used to describe a mental state where someone loses touch with reality. Symptoms might include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and negative symptoms like lack of motivation. So, I can probably eliminate some options that describe it as minor or involving happiness.

Looking at the options:

A: Says psychosis is persistent happiness and clarity. That doesn't sound right. Psychosis is more about losing reality, so A is probably wrong.

B: Calls it a minor disorder. No, psychosis is severe, so B is incorrect.

C: Talks about organic being from substance abuse and functional being congenital. I'm not sure about that. I thought organic (or perhaps now called neurocognitive disorders) are due to brain issues like diseases or injuries, while functional are things like schizophrenia without a clear brain abnormality. Substance abuse might cause organic, but I'm not certain if that's the main point here.

D: Organic from weather changes? That doesn't make sense. Weather affecting mental state that way seems unlikely, so D is probably wrong.

E: Organic caused by psychological trauma. Wait, I think trauma might relate more to other issues like PTSD, but for organic psychosis, isn't it more about physical brain issues? So E might be mixing things up.

F: Says psychosis is severe, causing impaired thinking and emotion. Then organic is due to structural brain issues, functional without such changes. This aligns with what I remember. Organic would be like from a tumor or infection, while functional is like schizophrenia where the brain looks structurally normal but doesn't function correctly.

G: Functional only in older adults. No, I think functional psychoses can occur at various ages, like schizophrenia typically starts in late teens to early 30s. So G is wrong.

H: Functional caused by brain damage. Wait, no, I thought functional doesn't have a clear physical cause. H would be the opposite of what F says, so probably wrong.

I: Psychosis is mild and improves without treatment. No, psychosis is serious and usually requires treatment, so I is wrong.

J: Functional from infections and organic from genetics. That doesn't sound right. Infections would be more likely to cause organic issues, and I'm not sure about genetics causing organic specifically. Maybe some, but I don't think this is the correct distinction.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be F. It correctly defines psychosis as a severe disorder affecting thinking and emotion. It distinguishes organic as having structural brain issues and functional without such changes.

The correct answer is F. Psychosis is a severe mental disorder characterized by impaired thinking and emotion. Organic psychosis results from structural brain abnormalities, such as lesions or diseases, while functional psychosis lacks visible brain pathology.
