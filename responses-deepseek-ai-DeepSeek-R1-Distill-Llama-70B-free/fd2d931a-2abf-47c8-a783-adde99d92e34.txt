Question:

The sex of a child is dictated by the inheritance of:

Options:

A: a single Y chromosome from the mother.
B: a single Y chromosome from the mother or father.
C: a single X chromosome from the father.
D: a recessive allele on the X chromosome.
E: a single Y chromosome from the father.
F: a single X chromosome from the mother.
G: both X and Y chromosomes from the father.
H: the number of Y chromosomes from the mother.
I: a dominant allele on the X chromosome.
J: the number of X chromosomes from the mother.

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about how the sex of a child is determined. Hmm, I remember from my classes that sex determination in humans is based on the chromosomes. Let me think.

Wait, I think humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and the last pair determines the sex. So females have two X chromosomes (XX), and males have one X and one Y (XY), right? 

Oh yeah, the mother contributes an X chromosome because she has two Xs. The father has either an X or a Y to give. So if the father gives an X, the child is female (XX), and if he gives a Y, the child is male (XY). 

So the question is asking what determines the child's sex. The options are about which chromosome or where it comes from. Let me look at the options.

Option E says a single Y from the father. That makes sense because the Y from the dad makes the child male. If the father gives X, it's female. So the Y from the father determines the sex as male.

What about the other options? Option A is Y from the mother. No, mothers don't have Y. They have two Xs.

Option B says Y from mother or father. No, mother can't give Y.

Option C is X from father. Well, yes, the father gives either X or Y. But if it's X, the child is female. But the presence of Y determines male. So the key is the Y.

Option D is recessive allele on X. I'm not sure. I think the sex is determined by the presence of the Y, not alleles on X.

Option F is X from mother, which they always give, so that doesn't determine male or female. So F is not specific.

Option G: both X and Y from father. Wait, no, father gives either X or Y, not both. So that can't be right.

Option H: number of Y from mother. Mother gives X, so no Y. So H is incorrect.

Option I: dominant allele on X. I'm not sure, but I think it's the Y that determines, not any allele on X.

Option J: number of X from mother. Mothers give one X, so that doesn't vary. It's the father's contribution that matters.

So the correct answer must be E because the Y from the father determines the child's sex as male. Without the Y, it's female.

The sex of a child is determined by the inheritance of chromosomes from the parents. In humans, females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). The mother contributes an X chromosome, while the father can contribute either an X or a Y chromosome. If the father contributes a Y chromosome, the child will be male (XY). If he contributes an X chromosome, the child will be female (XX). Therefore, the presence of the Y chromosome from the father determines the child's sex as male.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The mother does not contribute a Y chromosome; she only has X chromosomes.  
- **B**: Incorrect. The mother cannot contribute a Y chromosome.  
- **C**: Incorrect. While the father contributes an X chromosome, this results in a female child, not male.  
- **D**: Incorrect. Sex is determined by the presence of the Y chromosome, not a recessive allele on the X chromosome.  
- **E**: Correct. The inheritance of a single Y chromosome from the father determines the child's sex as male.  
- **F**: Incorrect. The mother always contributes an X chromosome, which does not determine the child's sex.  
- **G**: Incorrect. The father contributes only one chromosome (either X or Y), not both.  
- **H**: Incorrect. The mother does not contribute Y chromosomes.  
- **I**: Incorrect. Sex is determined by the Y chromosome, not a dominant allele on the X chromosome.  
- **J**: Incorrect. The mother always contributes one X chromosome, so this does not determine the child's sex.  

Thus, the correct answer is **E**, as the inheritance of a single Y chromosome from the father determines the child's sex as male.

Answer: E
