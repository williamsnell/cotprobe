Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this topic. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about displacement current. Hmm, I remember that displacement current is related to the rate of change of electric charge. Oh wait, right! The displacement current Id is given by the formula Id = dQ/dt, where Q is the charge. But wait, since the charge is changing with time in a sinusoidal manner, I think I need to find the maximum rate of change, which would involve the derivative of a sine function.

The problem states that a small metallic ball is charged positively and negatively in a sinusoidal way at 60 cycles per second (which is 60 Hz). The maximum charge is 1e-6 coulombs. They're asking for the displacement current in two cases: first, at 60 Hz, and second, if the frequency were 1e6 Hz.

Okay, so first, let's model the charge as a function of time. Since it's sinusoidal, I can write Q(t) = Q_max * sin(ωt), where ω is the angular frequency. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in some conventions, it's written as Q(t) = Q_max * sin(2πft), since f is the frequency. Alternatively, ω is 2πf, so both expressions are equivalent.

But wait, another thought: when dealing with maximum values in sinusoidal functions, sometimes it's easier to express it as Q(t) = Q_max * sin(ωt + φ), where φ is the phase. But since we're looking for the maximum displacement current, the phase doesn't matter because we're taking the maximum value of the derivative.

So the displacement current is the time derivative of the charge: Id(t) = dQ/dt.

Let me compute that derivative. So dQ/dt = d/dt [ Q_max sin(ωt) ] = Q_max * ω cos(ωt). The maximum value of the displacement current occurs when cos(ωt) is 1, so Id_max = Q_max * ω.

Wait, that makes sense. So the maximum displacement current is Q_max multiplied by the angular frequency.

Angular frequency ω is 2π times the frequency f. So ω = 2πf.

So putting it together: Id_max = Q_max * 2πf.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, right, because the charge is oscillating, the maximum rate of change occurs at the points where the charge is zero and the sine function is at its steepest slope.

So for the first part of the question, f is 60 Hz.

Let me plug in the numbers. Q_max is 1e-6 C.

So Id_max for f=60 is 1e-6 * 2π * 60.

Let me compute that. 2π is approximately 6.2832. 6.2832 * 60 is about 376.992. So 1e-6 * 376.992 equals 3.76992e-4 Amps. Hmm, that's 3.77e-4 A. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C: 3.77e-4, 6.28 amp.

Option H: 4.77e-4, 7.28 amp.

Wait, wait no, my calculation was 3.77e-4 for the first part. Let's see: 2pi*60 is 376.99... So 376.99 * 1e-6 is 0.00037699 A, which is 3.7699e-4 Amps. So that would be approximately 3.77e-4 Amps.

Now for the second part, when f is 1e6 Hz. So same formula: Id_max = 1e-6 * 2pi * 1e6.

Wait, 2pi is about 6.2832. So 1e-6 * 6.2832e6 = 6.2832 Amps. So 6.2832 A. So the second part is approximately 6.28 Amps.

Looking back at the options, option C has the first part as 3.77e-4 and the second as 6.28. So that would fit.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. I might have made a mistake.

Wait, 2π * 60 = 120π ≈ 376.99, so 1e-6 * 376.99 = 0.00037699 A, which is 3.77e-4. That's correct.

For f=1e6, 2π * 1e6 = 2e6 * π ≈ 6,283,185. So 1e-6 * 6,283,185 equals approximately 6.283185 A, which is 6.28 A. So yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option C says 3.77e-4 and 6.28. So the first part is 3.77e-4, which is option C. What about other options? Let me check the other options quickly.

Option E: 3.77e-3 and 6.28e1 (62.8 A). No, second part is too high.

Option J: 3.77e-5 and 6.28. No, first part is too small.

So the correct option should be C. But wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: 3.77 × 10^-4 amp, 6.28 amp.

Yes, that's what I got. So the answer should be option C.

To determine the displacement current, we use the formula for the maximum displacement current, \( I_d = Q_{\text{max}} \cdot \omega \), where \( \omega = 2\pi f \) is the angular frequency. The problem involves two cases: 

1. **Case 1: \( f = 60 \, \text{Hz} \)**  
   Substituting \( Q_{\text{max}} = 10^{-6} \, \text{C} \) and \( \omega = 2\pi \cdot 60 \), we calculate:  
   \[
   I_d = 10^{-6} \cdot 2\pi \cdot 60 = 10^{-6} \cdot 376.992 \approx 3.77 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{A}.
   \]

2. **Case 2: \( f = 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \)**  
   Substituting \( Q_{\text{max}} = 10^{-6} \, \text{C} \) and \( \omega = 2\pi \cdot 10^6 \), we calculate:  
   \[
   I_d = 10^{-6} \cdot 2\pi \cdot 10^6 = 10^{-6} \cdot 6,283,185.307 \approx 6.28 \, \text{A}.
   \]

Now, comparing these results with the given options:  
- Option C states \( 3.77 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{A} \) and \( 6.28 \, \text{A} \), which matches the calculated values.  
- Other options either have incorrect values for the first or second part of the problem.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**.
