Okay, so I need to figure out where the chicken was first domesticated. I remember from school that chickens have a wild ancestor, but I'm not exactly sure where that happened. Let me think... I think it's somewhere in Asia. Wait, the options include China as option J. But I also recall something about Southeast Asia, like maybe Thailand or something. But those options aren't here.

Wait, another thought: I've heard that chickens were domesticated from the red junglefowl. I think the red junglefowl is native to parts of Southeast Asia and possibly southern China. So if that's the case, then the domestication probably happened in that region. So China would be the answer, right?

Alternatively, I'm a bit confused because I've also heard that some studies suggest that chickens might have been domesticated in multiple places, but the primary or earliest place was in China. Or was it India? Let me think again. I'm pretty sure China is the most commonly cited place for chicken domestication. So looking at the options, option J is China.

Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. Are there other possibilities? Like, perhaps the Middle East or Egypt? Egypt is an option here (option H). But I think Egypt is more known for domesticating animals like cats and maybe some livestock, but not the chicken. The chicken's origin is more in the East.

So putting it all together, the earliest domestication of chickens is believed to have occurred in China, so the answer should be J.
