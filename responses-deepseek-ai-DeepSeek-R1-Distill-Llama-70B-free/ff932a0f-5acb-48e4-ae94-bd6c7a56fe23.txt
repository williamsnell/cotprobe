Question:

One of the events at the circus was Gabriella, the Human Cannonball. On Saturday she did four shows. Her distances measured 7.04 meters, 18.81 meters, 18.39 meters, and 19.94 meters. What was the total distance Gabriella flew that day?

Options:

A: 60.18 m
B: 70.18 m
C: 62.18 m
D: 57.14 m
E: 74.18 m
F: 66.18 m
G: 72.18 m
H: 64.18 m
I: 59.24 m
J: 68.18 m

Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Gabriella, the Human Cannonball. She did four shows on Saturday, and I need to find the total distance she flew that day. The distances given are 7.04 meters, 18.81 meters, 18.39 meters, and 19.94 meters. Hmm, okay, let's see how I can add these up.

Wait, adding them up one by one might be a bit tricky, but I think I can handle it. Let me start by adding the first two numbers: 7.04 and 18.81. So 7 plus 18 is 25, and then the decimals: 0.04 plus 0.81 is 0.85. So that gives me 25.85 meters for the first two shows.

Now, the next number is 18.39. Adding that to 25.85. Let's break it down. 25 plus 18 is 43, and 0.85 plus 0.39 is 1.24. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 0.85 plus 0.39 is actually 1.24. So adding 43 and 1.24 gives 44.24? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 25.85 plus 18.39. Maybe I should add them more carefully.

Let me write it down as if on paper:

  25.85
+ 18.39
--------
?

Starting from the right, 5 plus 9 is 14, carry over 1. 8 plus 3 plus 1 is 12, carry over 1. 5 plus 8 is 13, plus the carried 1 makes 14. And the 2 plus 1 is 3, plus the carried 1 makes 4. So that gives me 44.24 meters after three shows. Wait, wait, that seems high. Let me check again.

Wait, 25.85 + 18.39. 25 plus 18 is 43. 0.85 + 0.39 is 1.24. So 43 + 1.24 is 44.24. Okay, that's correct.

Now, the last number is 19.94. So adding 44.24 and 19.94.

Let me add 44 and 19 first. 44 + 19 is 63. Then the decimals: 0.24 + 0.94 is 1.18. So adding that to 63 gives 64.18 meters. Wait, that's the total?

Wait, let me make sure. Let me add all four numbers together in a different way. Maybe align them by decimal points:

7.04
18.81
18.39
19.94
--------

Let me add the first two: 7.04 + 18.81 = 25.85.

Then, add 18.39 to that: 25.85 + 18.39 = 44.24.

Then, add 19.94 to 44.24: 44.24 + 19.94.

Wait, 44 + 19 is 63. 0.24 + 0.94 is 1.18. So 63 + 1.18 is 64.18. So the total is 64.18 meters.

Looking at the options, option H is 64.18 m. So that must be the correct answer.

The total distance Gabriella flew is calculated by adding the four distances: 7.04 m, 18.81 m, 18.39 m, and 19.94 m. 

1. Adding the first two distances:  
   \( 7.04 + 18.81 = 25.85 \, \text{m} \).  

2. Adding the third distance:  
   \( 25.85 + 18.39 = 44.24 \, \text{m} \).  

3. Adding the fourth distance:  
   \( 44.24 + 19.94 = 64.18 \, \text{m} \).  

Thus, the total distance Gabriella flew that day is **64.18 meters**.  

The correct answer is **H: 64.18 m**.
