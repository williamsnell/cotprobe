C: is located between the left atrium and the left ventricle.
D: is prevented from everting by papillary muscles.
E: is open during systole.
F: prevents blood returning from the pulmonary trunk as the heart relaxes.
G: is the largest valve of the heart.
H: controls the flow of blood from the left ventricle to the right atrium.

Okay, so I have this question here about the heart's valves, specifically the right atrioventricular valve. Hmm, I need to figure out which option correctly completes the statement. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the heart has four main valves: two atrioventricular (AV) valves and two semilunar valves. The AV valves are between the atria and ventricles, while the semilunar ones are at the bases of the arteries leaving the heart.

The right AV valve is probably the tricuspid valve. Oh wait, wait. Let's clarify: the right AV valve is the tricuspid valve, which is between the right atrium and the right ventricle. The left AV valve is the mitral or bicuspid valve, between the left atrium and left ventricle.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: is a semilunar valve. No, AV valves aren't semilunar. Those are the pulmonary and aortic valves. So A is incorrect.

Option B: responsible for pumping blood to the rest of the body. That sounds like the job of the left ventricle, and the aortic valve. The right AV valve just lets blood flow into the right ventricle. So B is probably not right.

Option C: located between left atrium and left ventricle. That's the mitral valve, not the right AV. So C is wrong.

Option D: prevented from everting by papillary muscles. Papillary muscles are attached to the AV valves via chordae tendineae. When the ventricles contract, these muscles pull on the valves to prevent them from prolapsing (everting) into the atria. So D sounds correct for the right AV valve.

Option E: is open during systole. Wait, during systole, the ventricles contract. So the AV valves (tricuspid and mitral) close because the pressure in the ventricles is higher than the atria. The semilunar valves open. So E is incorrect because during systole, the AV valves are closed.

Option F: prevents blood returning from the pulmonary trunk as the heart relaxes. That sounds like the pulmonary valve, which is semilunar. When the heart relaxes (diastole), the pulmonary valve closes to prevent backflow. So F is incorrect.

Option G: is the largest valve of the heart. I think the tricuspid isn't the largest. Maybe the mitral or aortic. Not sure, but I don't think G is correct for the right AV valve.

Option H: controls flow from left ventricle to right atrium. That doesn't make sense. The tricuspid valve is between right atrium and right ventricle. So H is wrong.

So the correct answer should be D. The right atrioventricular valve is prevented from everting by papillary muscles.

The right atrioventricular valve, also known as the tricuspid valve, is located between the right atrium and the right ventricle. Among the given options, the correct completion of the statement is that this valve is prevented from everting by papillary muscles. These muscles, along with chordae tendineae, ensure the valve does not prolapse into the atrium during ventricular contraction.

Option A is incorrect because semilunar valves are located at the bases of the pulmonary and aortic arteries, not between atria and ventricles. Option B is incorrect because the right atrioventricular valve does not pump blood to the rest of the body; it regulates flow into the right ventricle. Option C is incorrect because it describes the mitral valve, not the tricuspid valve. Option E is incorrect because AV valves close during systole. Option F is incorrect because it describes the function of the pulmonary valve. Option G is incorrect as the tricuspid valve is not the largest valve. Option H is incorrect because it misrepresents the direction of blood flow.

The correct answer is **D**.

Answer: D
