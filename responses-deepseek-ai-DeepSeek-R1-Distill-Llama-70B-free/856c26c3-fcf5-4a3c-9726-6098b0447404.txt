Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the equation of the tangent line to a curve at a specific point. The curve is given by F(t) = (t² + 1, 2^t), and I'm looking for the tangent where y equals 4. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that to find a tangent line to a parametric curve, I need two things: a point on the curve and the slope of the tangent at that point. The point is given when y=4, so I need to find the corresponding t value where the y-component of F(t) is 4.

So the y-component is 2^t. Setting that equal to 4: 2^t =4. I know that 2 squared is 4, so t must be 2. So the point is when t=2. Let me plug t=2 into F(t) to get the coordinates. The x-component is t² +1, so that's 2² +1 =4+1=5. The y-component is 4, as given. So the point is (5,4).

Wait wait, hold on. Let me double-check that. Because F(t) is (t²+1, 2^t). So when t=2, x is 2² +1=5, y is 2^2=4. Yep, so the point is (5,4). Got it.

Now I need the slope of the tangent line at that point. For parametric equations, I remember the formula for the slope is (dy/dt)/(dx/dt) evaluated at that t value. So I need to compute dy/dt and dx/dt.

Let's compute dy/dt first. The y-component is 2^t, so the derivative of that with respect to t is 2^t * ln(2). Because the derivative of a^t is a^t ln(a). So dy/dt = 2^t ln2.

Then dx/dt. The x-component is t² +1, so the derivative is 2t.

So the slope m is (dy/dt)/(dx/dt) = [2^t ln2]/[2t]. Now, since we're evaluating at t=2, let's plug that in. So 2^2 is 4, ln2 is ln2, and 2t is 4.

So m = (4 ln2)/4 = ln2. Oh, that's nice, it simplifies to ln2.

Wait, so the slope is ln2. Now the equation of the tangent line can be written using the point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1), where (x1,y1) is the point (5,4).

So plugging in, y -4 = ln2 (x -5). Hmm, looking at the options, let me see which one matches this.

Looking through the options:

Option B: y – 4 = ln 2(x – 5). That's exactly what I have.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

So F(t) is (t²+1, 2^t). At t=2, x=5, y=4. Correct.

Then dy/dt = 2^t ln2, which at t=2 is 4 ln2. dx/dt is 2t, which at t=2 is 4. So m= (4 ln2)/4 = ln2. Yes.

So the equation is y-4=ln2 (x-5). That's option B.

But wait, let me look again at the options to make sure. Let me list them:

Option B: y – 4 = ln 2(x –5). That's correct.

Option E is y-4=4(x-2) ln2. Hmm, no, because the slope is ln2, not multiplied by 4 or anything else.

So yeah, the correct answer should be option B.

To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve \( F(t) = (t^2 + 1, 2^t) \) at the point where \( y = 4 \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Identify the point on the curve**:  
   The \( y \)-component of \( F(t) \) is \( 2^t \). Setting \( 2^t = 4 \), we find \( t = 2 \) (since \( 2^2 = 4 \)).  
   Substituting \( t = 2 \) into \( F(t) \), the \( x \)-component is \( t^2 + 1 = 2^2 + 1 = 5 \). Thus, the point is \( (5, 4) \).

2. **Calculate the slope of the tangent line**:  
   For parametric equations, the slope \( m \) is given by \( \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt} \).  
   - The derivative of the \( y \)-component \( 2^t \) with respect to \( t \) is \( \frac{dy}{dt} = 2^t \ln(2) \).  
   - The derivative of the \( x \)-component \( t^2 + 1 \) with respect to \( t \) is \( \frac{dx}{dt} = 2t \).  
   At \( t = 2 \):  
     \[
     \frac{dy}{dt} = 2^2 \ln(2) = 4 \ln(2), \quad \frac{dx}{dt} = 2(2) = 4.
     \]  
     Thus,  
     \[
     m = \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{4 \ln(2)}{4} = \ln(2).
     \]

3. **Write the equation of the tangent line**:  
   Using the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \), where \( (x_1, y_1) = (5, 4) \) and \( m = \ln(2) \), we get:  
   \[
   y - 4 = \ln(2)(x - 5).
   \]

4. **Match with the options**:  
   Comparing with the given options, the correct equation is:  
   \[
   \text{Option B: } y - 4 = \ln(2)(x - 5).
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

**B**
