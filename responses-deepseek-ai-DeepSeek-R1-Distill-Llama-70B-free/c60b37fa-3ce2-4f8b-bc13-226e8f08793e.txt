Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the theoretical variance of a random variable X with a given probability distribution. The distribution is given as x and the corresponding probabilities. Let me list them out clearly:

x | Pr(X = x)
---|---
0 | 1/4
1 | 1/2
2 | 1/8
3 | 1/8

I remember that variance is calculated using the formula Var(X) = E[X²] - (E[X])². So I need to find the expected value E[X] first and then E[X squared].

First, let's compute E[X], the expected value. That's the sum of each x multiplied by its probability.

E[X] = (0)*(1/4) + (1)*(1/2) + (2)*(1/8) + (3)*(1/8)

Let me calculate each term:

0 * 1/4 = 0

1 * 1/2 = 1/2

2 * 1/8 = 2/8 which simplifies to 1/4

3 * 1/8 = 3/8

Now, adding them up: 0 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 3/8.

To add these, I'll convert them to eighths since that's a common denominator.

1/2 is 4/8, 1/4 is 2/8, and 3/8 is 3/8.

So adding: 4/8 + 2/8 + 3/8 = 9/8. Wait, no, wait. Because the first term is 0, so it's 4/8 (from 1/2) plus 2/8 (from 2*1/8) is 6/8, plus 3/8 is 9/8. Wait, but 9/8 is 1.125. Hmm, that seems a bit high, but let me check.

Wait, 0*(1/4) is 0, correct. 1*(1/2) is 0.5, 2*(1/8)=0.25, 3*(1/8)=0.375. Adding those: 0 + 0.5 is 0.5, plus 0.25 is 0.75, plus 0.375 is 1.125. Yep, that's right. So E[X] = 1.125.

Now, I need to compute E[X²], which is the sum of x squared times their probabilities.

E[X²] = (0^2)*(1/4) + (1^2)*(1/2) + (2^2)*(1/8) + (3^2)*(1/8)

Let me compute each term:

0^2 * 1/4 = 0

1^2 * 1/2 = 1 * 1/2 = 1/2 = 0.5

2^2 * 1/8 = 4 * 1/8 = 4/8 = 0.5

3^2 * 1/8 = 9 * 1/8 = 9/8 = 1.125

Now add these up: 0 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.125. Let's see: 0.5 + 0.5 is 1, plus 1.125 is 2.125. So E[X²] is 2.125.

Wait a minute, let me double-check. 

0 squared is 0, so that term is 0. 

1 squared is 1, multiplied by 1/2 is 0.5. 

2 squared is 4, times 1/8 is 0.5. 

3 squared is 9, times 1/8 is 1.125. 

Adding them: 0 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.125 = 2.125. Yep, correct.

Now, the variance is E[X²] minus (E[X]) squared. So Var(X) = 2.125 - (1.125)^2.

Let me compute 1.125 squared. 1.125 is 9/8, so (9/8)^2 is 81/64, which is 1.265625.

So Var(X) = 2.125 - 1.265625 = 0.859375.

Hmm, looking at the options, option I is 0.859. That seems to match.

Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 

Alternative way: Let me compute everything in fractions to avoid decimal confusion.

E[X] was 9/8, as 1.125 is 9/8. So E[X]^2 is (9/8)^2 = 81/64.

E[X²] is 2.125, which is 17/8. Because 2 is 16/8, plus 1/8 is 17/8.

So Var(X) = 17/8 - 81/64.

Convert 17/8 to 64 denominator: 17/8 = (17 * 8) / (8 * 8) = 136/64? Wait, no. 17 * 8 is 136. Wait, no: 17/8 is (17 * 8) ? No, wait, to convert 17/8 to 64ths, multiply numerator and denominator by 8:

17/8 = (17 * 8) / (8 * 8) )? No, that can't be right. Wait, 8 * 8 is 64, so 17/8 = (17 * 8) / 64. 17 * 8 is 136, so 136/64.

So Var(X) = 136/64 - 81/64 = (136 -81)/64 = 55/64.

Wait, 55 divided by 64: let me compute that. 55 ÷ 64.

Well, 64 × 0.8 is 51.2. 55-51.2=3.8. 3.8/64 ≈ 0.059375. So 0.8 + 0.059375 = 0.859375. So that's 0.859375.

So yeah, that's 0.859, which matches option I: 0.859.

So the correct answer should be I.

To find the theoretical variance of the random variable \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( E[X] \)
The expected value \( E[X] \) is computed as:

\[
E[X] = \sum x \cdot P(X = x)
\]

Substituting the given probabilities:

\[
E[X] = (0 \cdot \frac{1}{4}) + (1 \cdot \frac{1}{2}) + (2 \cdot \frac{1}{8}) + (3 \cdot \frac{1}{8})
\]

\[
E[X] = 0 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{8} + \frac{3}{8} = 0 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.375 = 1.125
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( E[X^2] \)
The expected value \( E[X^2] \) is computed as:

\[
E[X^2] = \sum x^2 \cdot P(X = x)
\]

Substituting the given probabilities:

\[
E[X^2] = (0^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4}) + (1^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}) + (2^2 \cdot \frac{1}{8}) + (3^2 \cdot \frac{1}{8})
\]

\[
E[X^2] = 0 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{4}{8} + \frac{9}{8} = 0 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.125 = 2.125
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Variance
Now, compute the variance:

\[
\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2
\]

Substitute \( E[X^2] = 2.125 \) and \( E[X] = 1.125 \):

\[
\text{Var}(X) = 2.125 - (1.125)^2
\]

First, calculate \( (1.125)^2 \):

\[
(1.125)^2 = 1.265625
\]

Now subtract:

\[
\text{Var}(X) = 2.125 - 1.265625 = 0.859375
\]

### Final Answer
The theoretical variance of \( X \) is approximately \( 0.859 \), which corresponds to option **I**.
