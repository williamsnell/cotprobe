Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. The question is about finding the average kinetic energy of air molecules at a certain temperature and then determining a typical speed for nitrogen molecules. Hmm, I remember that this relates to the kinetic theory of gases. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the average kinetic energy part. I think the formula for the average kinetic energy (KE) of gas molecules is (3/2)k*T, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Oh wait, right, because each degree of freedom contributes (1/2)k*T. Since a molecule has three translational degrees of freedom, it's (3/2)kT.

Boltzmann's constant, k, is 1.38 × 10^-23 J/K, if I'm not mistaken. And the temperature given is 300 K. So plugging those numbers in: KE = (3/2) * 1.38e-23 * 300. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 3/2 is 1.5. So 1.5 times 1.38e-23 is about 2.07e-23. Then multiply by 300: 2.07e-23 * 300 equals 6.21e-21 J. Okay, so the average kinetic energy is 6.21e-21 J. I'll need to check the options for that value.

Now, the second part: typical speed of nitrogen molecules. Nitrogen is diatomic, N2, but the problem says the mass is about 4.68e-26 kg. That makes sense because the molar mass of N2 is 28 g/mol. Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 per mole. So per molecule, mass m would be 28e-3 kg/mol divided by Avogadro's number. Let me double-check that:

m = (28e-3 kg/mol) / (6.022e23 mol^-1) ≈ 4.65e-26 kg. Oh, the given value is 4.68e-26, so that's correct.

The typical speed, I think, refers to the root-mean-square (rms) speed. The formula for rms speed is sqrt(3kT/m). Wait, or is it sqrt(3RT/M) where R is the gas constant and M is molar mass? Oh right, both are equivalent, but here we have m as the mass per molecule, so the formula would be sqrt((3kT)/m).

Wait, let me get the formula right. The rms speed v_rms is sqrt(3kT/m). So plugging in the numbers: k is 1.38e-23 J/K, T is 300 K, m is 4.68e-26 kg.

So calculate numerator first: 3 * 1.38e-23 * 300. Let me compute that step by step. 3 * 1.38 is about 4.14. 4.14e-23 * 300 is 1.242e-20. So the numerator is 1.242e-20.

Then divide by m: 1.242e-20 / 4.68e-26 kg. Let me compute that division. Let's see, 1.242e-20 / 4.68e-26 = (1.242 / 4.68) * 10^( -20 +26 ) = (approx 0.265) * 1e6. So about 265,000. Wait, that can't be right because that's way too high. Wait, no, wait. Wait let me recalculate that division.

Wait 1.242e-20 divided by 4.68e-26. Let's write it as (1.242 / 4.68) * (1e-20 / 1e-26) ) 

1e-20 / 1e-26 is 1e6. 

1.242 /4.68 is approximately 0.2653. 

So 0.2653 * 1e6 = 265,300 m/s. Wait, that seems way too high because I remember that nitrogen molecules move at a few hundred m/s, not hundreds of thousands. Oh wait, I must have messed up some exponent.

Wait wait, let me recalculate the numerator:

3 * k * T = 3 * 1.38e-23 * 300.

3 * 1.38 is 4.14. 4.14e-23 * 300 is 4.14 * 3e2 * 1e-23 = 12.42e-21 (since 4.14 *3 is 12.42 and 1e-23 *1e2 is 1e-21). So 12.42e-21 J·m? Wait, no, the units would be in terms of energy per molecule. But when using the rms formula, the units should work out correctly.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 3 * 1.38e-23 * 300.

3 * 300 is 900. 900 * 1.38e-23 = 900 *1.38 *1e-23 = 1242e-23 = 1.242e-20. So that's correct.

Then, v_rms^2 = (3kT)/(m) → v_rms = sqrt( (3kT)/m )

So (3kT) is 1.242e-20, m is 4.68e-26 kg.

So (1.242e-20) / (4.68e-26) = (1.242 /4.68 ) * (1e-20 / 1e-26) = 0.2653 * 1e6 = 265,300 m/s. Wait, that's way too high for the speed of gas molecules. I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, wait, no, no, wait. Because when I use the formula, the denominator is m, which is in kg. Let me double-check the formula.

Ah! Wait, another approach. The rms speed can also be calculated using (3RT)/(M), where M is the molar mass in kg/mol. Let me think. R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/mol·K. M for N2 is 0.028 kg/mol.

So v_rms = sqrt(3RT/M). Let's compute that.

R is 8.314, T is 300. So 3*8.314*300 = 3 *8.314 =24.942, times 300 is 7478.2. Then divided by M (0.028 kg/mol): 7478.2 / 0.028 ≈ 267,200 m/s. Hmm, same order of magnitude. But wait, that's 2.67e5 m/s, which is way higher than the options given. The options are in the range of 1e2 to 1e3 m/s.

Wait, that can't be right. Because I remember that the rms speed for nitrogen at room temperature is about 454 m/s or so. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the mass somewhere. Let me try calculating v_rms again using the first formula: sqrt(3kT/m).

Given: m is 4.68e-26 kg.

Compute 3kT: 3 * 1.38e-23 * 300 = 1.242e-20 J.

So 3kT/m = 1.242e-20 / 4.68e-26 = (1.242 /4.68 ) * 1e6 = 0.2653 * 1e6 = 265,300 m/s.

Wait, that's 2.653e5 m/s, which is 265,300 m/s. But that's way higher than any of the options given. So where did I go wrong?

Wait a second, perhaps I confused the mass of a nitrogen molecule with the molar mass. Let me double-check the molar mass. Nitrogen gas is N2, so the molar mass is 28 g/mol. 28 g is 0.028 kg/mol.

Wait, but per molecule, the mass is (0.028 kg/mol) / (6.022e23 molecules/mol) = 4.65e-26 kg, which matches the given value of 4.68e-26. So that's correct.

Hmm, but according to this, the rms speed is about 265,000 m/s, which is way higher than the options given. But looking at the options, the highest speed is 1.5e3, which is 1500 m/s. So something's wrong here. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the average speed instead of rms? Or perhaps the question is referring to the most probable speed. Wait, the question says "a typical speed", which is a bit ambiguous. But if I'm getting 2.6e5 m/s, but the options have 450 m/s, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Let's compute 3kT/m.

3kT: 3 * 1.38e-23 J/K * 300 K = 3 * 1.38e-23 * 300.

Let me compute 1.38e-23 *300: that's 4.14e-21. Multiply by 3: 1.242e-20.

Divide by mass m=4.68e-26 kg:

1.242e-20 /4.68e-26 = (1.242 /4.68) * (1e-20 /1e-26) = 0.265 * 1e6 = 265,000 m/s.

But wait, that can't be right. Because I remember that at room temperature, nitrogen has an rms speed of about 454 m/s. So perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe I should have used (3/2)kT for energy, but for speed, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Maybe using the molar mass approach. Molar mass M = 0.028 kg/mol, R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

v_rms = sqrt(3RT/M) = sqrt( (3 *8.314 *300 ) / 0.028 )

Compute numerator: 3 *8.314 is 24.942, times 300 is 7478.2.

Divide by 0.028: 7478.2 /0.028 = 267,200 m/s. Again, same result. So why is this conflicting with what I remember?

Wait, wait, perhaps I confused kg with g somewhere. No, because M is in kg/mol. Oh wait, wait, no, wait. Let me double-check R. Oh wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), correct. M is 0.028 kg/mol, correct. So the calculation should be correct, but the result is way higher than expected.

Wait, I think I know the problem now. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the value I'm getting is roughly 450 m/s when I use the right approach. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 3RT: 3 *8.314 *300 = 3*8.314=24.942; 24.942 *300=7478.2 J/mol.

Divide by M (0.028 kg/mol): 7478.2 /0.028 = 7478.2 /0.028.

Let me compute that division. 7478.2 / 0.028. 0.028 is 28e-3.

So 7478.2 / 0.028 = (7478.2 /28 ) * 1e3.

7478.2 /28: Let me compute 7478 /28.

28 * 267 = 7476, because 28*200=5600, 28*67=1876; 5600+1876=7476. So 7478.2 is 7476 +2.2 → 267 + (2.2/28)=267 + 0.0786 ≈267.0786.

So 267.0786 *1e3= 267,078.6 m²/s²? No, wait, let me think: the units of v² would be (J/(mol·K) * K) / (kg/mol) → (J/(mol)) * mol/kg → J/kg.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing units here. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is correct, but the result is 267,000 m/s, which is way higher than the options. So perhaps I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is written differently. Let me check the formula again. Oh wait, the correct formula for rms speed is sqrt(3RT/M), where M is molar mass. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should have used M in kg per molecule, but no, the formula uses M in kg/mol. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the mass per molecule in the formula. So v_rms = sqrt(3kT/m), with m being the mass per molecule.

Wait, let's try that again. m=4.68e-26 kg.

So 3kT/m = 3 *1.38e-23 *300 /4.68e-26.

Compute numerator: 3 *1.38e-23 =4.14e-23. Multiply by 300 →4.14e-23 *3e2 =1.242e-20.

Divide by 4.68e-26: 1.242e-20 /4.68e-26 = (1.242/4.68) *1e6 → 0.2653 *1e6 =2.653e5 m/s.

Again, same result. But according to my notes, nitrogen's rms speed is about 454 m/s at 300 K. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the mass of a nitrogen molecule. Let me recompute the mass. Molar mass of N2 is 28 g/mol, which is 0.028 kg/mol. Number of molecules per mole is Avogadro's number, 6.022e23. So mass per molecule is 0.028 /6.022e23 = approx 4.65e-26 kg, which matches the given 4.68e-26 kg. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check an online source for rms speed of nitrogen at 300K. Oh, but I can't right now because I'm in exam conditions. Okay, think again. Maybe I made a miscalculation in the exponent.

Wait, 1.242e-20 divided by 4.68e-26 is 1.242 /4.68 = 0.265, and 1e-20 /1e-26 is 1e6, so 0.265e6 is 265,000. Hmm, but I'm confident that room temperature speeds are lower. Wait, perhaps the calculation is correct, but I'm confusing rms with average speed. Or perhaps the question is referring to something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question asks for the average speed, not the rms speed. The average speed (or mean speed) is different. The formula for average speed is sqrt(8kT/(pi m)).

So let's compute that. v_avg = sqrt(8kT/(pi m)).

Compute 8kT:8*1.38e-23*300=8*4.14e-21=3.31e-20.

Divide by pi*m: 3.31e-20 / (3.1416 *4.68e-26) = 3.31e-20 / (1.47e-25) ≈ (3.31 /1.47) * 1e5 ≈ 2.25 * 1e5 =2.25e5 m/s.

Still way too high. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the temperature is given in Celsius, but no, the question says 300 K, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponent in the mass. Let me check: m is 4.68e-26 kg, yes. So let me try to compute 3kT/m again.

3kT = 3 * 1.38e-23 *300 = 1.242e-20.

So 1.242e-20 /4.68e-26 = (1.242 /4.68) *1e6.

1.242 divided by 4.68 is approximately 0.265.

0.265 *1e6 is 265,000 m/s.

Wait, that's 2.65e5 m/s, which is 265,000 m/s. But that's way higher than any of the options given. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem. But looking at the options, the highest speed is 1.5e3 m/s. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, let me look at the options again. Option A has 5.15e2 m/s, which is 515 m/s. Option D has 6.21e2 (621 m/s). Option J is 7e2 m/s. So all are lower than 1000 m/s.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the translational kinetic energy as (3/2)kT per molecule, which I did get 6.21e-21 J, matching option A's first value. Then for the speed, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me try the calculation again, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Compute 3kT/m:

3kT = 3 *1.38e-23 *300.

3 *1.38 =4.14, so 4.14e-23 *300 =4.14e-23 *3e2= 1.242e-20.

Divide by m=4.68e-26 kg: 1.242e-20 /4.68e-26.

Let me write this as (1.242 /4.68) * 1e(-20 - (-26))= (0.265) *1e6= 0.265e6 =2.65e5 m/s.

Hmm, same as before. But none of the options have that. So perhaps the question is using a different approach or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the speed using the average kinetic energy. Since KE is (1/2)mv². We found KE is 6.21
