Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that we have a sample of nitrogen gas with a mass of 14 grams. It's at 298 K and 1.00 bar pressure. The process is an isothermal reversible expansion where the volume doubles. We need to find the total change in entropy. The options are from A to J, each with different values.

Hmm, I remember that entropy change for an ideal gas can be calculated using the formula ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) for an isothermal process, because temperature is constant. Since it's a reversible process, that's the formula I should use here.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. Nitrogen is a diatomic gas, N₂. So the molar mass would be 28 g/mol. Oh right, because each N atom is 14 g/mol, and there are two of them. So the mass given is 14 grams. That would be 14g / 28 g/mol = 0.5 mol. So n is 0.5 moles.

Right, so n is 0.5. R is the gas constant, which is 8.314 J/mol·K. Since the process is isothermal, the temperature doesn't change, so the entropy change formula applies.

The volume is doubling, so V2 is 2V1. So the ratio V2/V1 is 2. But wait, in entropy equations, since it's expansion, the system is doing work, so the entropy change should be positive, right? Because the gas is expanding into a larger volume, which increases disorder.

Wait, the formula is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1). So plugging in the numbers: 0.5 * 8.314 * ln(2). Let me calculate that.

First, ln(2) is approximately 0.693. So 0.5 * 8.314 is about 4.157. Multiply that by 0.693 gives... let's see, 4 * 0.693 is 2.772, and 0.157 * 0.693 is around 0.108. So total is approximately 2.88 J/K.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 2.88. Let me check the options again. Option E is 3.2, which is close. But wait, maybe my calculation was a bit off. Let me be more precise.

Let me re-calculate. 0.5 * 8.314 = 4.157. Multiply by ln(2) which is 0.693147. So 4.157 * 0.693147.

Let me compute this accurately:

4 * 0.693147 = 2.772588
0.157 * 0.693147 ≈ 0.1088
So total is approximately 2.772588 + 0.1088 = 2.8814 J/K.

Hmm, approximately 2.88 J/K. So looking at the options, the closest value is E: 3.2, but that's a little higher. Wait, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another thought. Since pressure is given, maybe I should consider using the pressure ratio instead of volume. Because in entropy calculations, sometimes it's expressed in terms of pressure. Oh wait, the formula can also be written as ΔS = nR ln(P1/P2), because PV = nRT, so if T is constant, V is inversely proportional to P. So for expansion, volume increases, so pressure decreases.

Wait, when volume doubles, pressure would halve, since n and T are constant. So P1 is the initial pressure, P2 would be half of that. So the ratio P1/P2 is 2.

So using the pressure form: ΔS = nR ln(P1/P2) = 0.5 * 8.314 * ln(2). Which is the same as before. So same result.

Wait, but the options don't have 2.88, but maybe I made an error in the number of moles. Oh wait, wait. Nitrogen is diatomic, N₂. So the molar mass is 28 g/mol, correct. 14g /28 g/mol is indeed 0.5 moles. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the volume doubles, so the entropy change of the surroundings is considered? Wait, no, the question asks for the total change in entropy. But in a reversible process, the surroundings' entropy change is equal and opposite to the system's. Wait, no, for an isothermal reversible expansion, the heat expelled by the system is absorbed by the surroundings. So the entropy change of the system is +nR ln(V2/V1), and the surroundings would have a change of -nR ln(V2/V1) if it's a reversible process. Wait, but that can't be right. Because for a reversible process, the total entropy change is zero. Wait, no, that's only for a reversible process in a cyclic manner. Wait, no, I think I might be confusing things.

Wait, the problem says it's an isothermal reversible expansion. So the process is reversible, which means it's done slowly and the system is in equilibrium at every step. For such a process, the change in entropy of the system is the same as the heat transferred divided by temperature. But since the process is reversible, the heat lost by the system is gained by the surroundings. So the system's entropy change is +nR ln(V2/V1), and the surroundings' is -nR ln(V2/V1), so the total entropy change is zero. But wait, that can't be right because the options have non-zero values.

Wait, no, no. Wait, when a gas expands reversibly and isothermally, the heat Q is absorbed by the system from the surroundings. The entropy change of the system is Q_rev/T, which is positive because Q is positive (heat absorbed) and T is positive. The surroundings lose that same amount of heat, so their entropy change is -Q_rev/T. So the total entropy change is ΔS_system + ΔS_surroundings = Q_rev/T - Q_rev/T = 0. So in a reversible process, the total entropy change of the universe is zero.

But wait, the question asks for the total change in entropy. So if it's a reversible process, the total entropy change (system + surroundings) is zero. But the options don't have zero except option G.

Wait, that's conflicting. Because earlier I thought the system's entropy change is positive, but if the process is reversible, the surroundings' entropy change is negative, making the total zero. So the correct answer would be zero, which is option G.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the process is expansion, so system's entropy increases, but surroundings' decreases. But for a reversible process, the total entropy is zero.

But wait, I'm getting confused now. Let me think again.

In an isothermal reversible expansion:

ΔS_system = +nR ln(V2/V1) = +nR ln(2).

ΔS_surroundings = -nR ln(V2/V1) = -nR ln(2).

Total ΔS = ΔS_system + ΔS_surroundings = zero.

So the answer would be G: 0.

But wait, that's only when the process is reversible. Because in a reversible process, the heat expelled to the surroundings is exactly balanced by the heat absorbed, so the entropy changes cancel out.

But wait, when I first thought, the system's entropy increases, but surroundings decrease by the same amount. So total is zero.

But wait, in the question, is the process reversible? Yes, it says 'isothermal reversible expansion'.

So the total change in entropy (system plus surroundings) is zero. So the correct answer would be G: 0.

But earlier I thought the change in system's entropy is positive, but that's only the system's part. The question says 'total change in entropy', which would be system plus surroundings.

Wait, but wait another thing. Is that correct? Because in reality, in a reversible process, the surroundings' entropy change is negative of the system's. So the total change is zero. So the answer would be G.

But then why is the option G present? Let me check the options again. Option G is 0.

So the correct answer would be G: 0.

Wait, but wait. Another angle. For the entropy change of the universe (system + surroundings), in a reversible process, it's zero. But wait, reversible processes are ideal and only occur when the system is in equilibrium. So maybe the question is asking only about the system's entropy change, not the total. But the question says 'total change in entropy', so that would include both.

Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question. It says, 'the total change in entropy when a sample of nitrogen gas...'. So if it's just the system, the entropy change is positive. But if it's system plus surroundings, it's zero.

Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. But in thermodynamics, when we talk about 'total change in entropy', it refers to the universe, i.e., system plus surroundings. So in that case, for a reversible process, the total is zero.

But wait, when I first did the calculation, I thought the system's entropy is about 2.88 J/K. But that's just the system's part. So if the question is asking for the system's entropy change, then the answer would be around 2.88, which is near option E (3.2) or perhaps another option. But none of the options exactly match that except maybe option E is close.

Wait, looking back at the options, option E is 3.2, which is higher than my calculation of ~2.88. Maybe I should check my numbers again.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

n = 14g /28g/mol = 0.5 mol.

ΔS = n R ln(V2/V1) = 0.5 * 8.314 * ln(2).

Compute 0.5 *8.314 = 4.157.

ln(2) is approximately 0.69314718056.

So 4.157 * 0.69314718056.

Let me compute that:

4 * 0.693147 = 2.772588

0.157 * 0.693147: Let's compute 0.1 * 0.693147 = 0.0693147; 0.05 * 0.693147=0.034657; 0.007 *0.693147≈0.004852. So adding these: 0.0693147 +0.034657=0.1039717 +0.004852≈0.1088237.

So total is 2.772588 + 0.1088237 ≈ 2.8814117 J/K.

So approximately 2.88 J/K.

Looking back at the options, none of them match exactly. The closest is E:3.2 and B:2.3. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: since the problem involves pressure, perhaps I should compute using the ideal gas law to find the volume change. But wait, in an isothermal process, the entropy change depends only on the volume or pressure ratio, not the absolute values. So that shouldn't matter.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the process as irreversible? But the question says it's reversible. So that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question might be only asking for the entropy change of the system, not the total. So if the question is "total change in entropy", but perhaps it's only considering the system, then the answer would be 2.88, which is approximately 2.88 J/K. But the options don't have this exact value. So the closest option is E:3.2 or perhaps B:2.3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the molar mass again. Nitrogen gas is N₂, so molar mass is 28 g/mol. 14 grams would be 0.5 moles. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the gas constant R is taken as 8.314 J/mol·K, but sometimes people use 8.31 or 8.315. Let me recalculate.

n =0.5, R=8.314, ln2=0.6931.

0.5 *8.314 =4.157.

4.157 *0.6931 = let's compute more accurately.

4 * 0.6931 =2.7724.

0.157 *0.6931: Let's do 0.1*0.6931 = 0.06931; 0.05*0.6931=0.034655; 0.007*0.6931=0.0048517.

Adding 0.06931 +0.034655 =0.103965 +0.0048517=0.1088167.

Total is 2.7724 +0.1088167=2.8812167 J/K.

So approximately 2.88 J/K.

Looking at the options, the closest one is E:3.2, which is higher. But perhaps the question is considering the molar gas constant as 8.3 J/mol·K, which would give 0.5 *8.3=4.15. 4.15 *0.6931≈2.879 J/K, which is still about 2.88.

Wait, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the sign. Because when you double the volume in expansion, the entropy change is positive. So the options don't have 2.88, but perhaps the intended answer was option E:3.2, but that seems a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the process. Let me think again about the formula.

Wait, another formula: entropy change can also be calculated using ΔS = nR ln(P1/P2). Since the volume doubles, pressure halves. So P1/P2 =2. So ΔS =0.5 *8.314 * ln(2)= same as before, 2.88.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is 2.88, but none of the options match. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, wait. The problem states that the gas is nitrogen. Nitrogen is diatomic, so maybe the degrees of freedom affect the entropy calculation? No, because the formula ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) is for the ideal gas, regardless of being monoatomic or diatomic. So that doesn't change the calculation.

Another thought: Maybe the entropy change is per mole, but no, the calculation already accounts for the number of moles.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the change in entropy of the surroundings, which would be negative of the system's. So if the system's is +2.88, surroundings' is -2.88, making total zero. But the question says 'total change in entropy', which would then be zero.

So the correct answer would be option G:0.

Wait, but earlier I thought that's the case only for the universe (system + surroundings). So if the question is asking for the total change in entropy of the universe, that's zero. So the answer would be G:0.

But I'm a bit confused because the initial calculation gives a positive value, but considering the surroundings, it cancels out.

Wait, but in a reversible process, the total entropy change is zero. So the correct answer is G:0.

I think that makes sense. So the answer should be G:0.
</think>

To calculate the total change in entropy for the given isothermal reversible expansion of nitrogen gas, we start by noting that the process is reversible and isothermal. For such a process, the total entropy change of the universe (system + surroundings) is zero. This is because the entropy gained by the system is exactly balanced by the entropy lost by the surroundings.

The system's entropy change for an isothermal process can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = nR \ln\left(\frac{V_2}{V_1}\right)
\]

Here:
- \( n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{14 \, \text{g}}{28 \, \text{g/mol}} = 0.5 \, \text{mol} \),
- \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \),
- \( \frac{V_2}{V_1} = 2 \) (since the volume doubles).

Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = 0.5 \cdot 8.314 \cdot \ln(2)
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.693 \):

\[
\Delta S_{\text{system}} = 0.5 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 0.693 \approx 2.88 \, \text{J/K}
\]

However, since the process is reversible, the surroundings' entropy change is:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{surroundings}} = -\Delta S_{\text{system}} = -2.88 \, \text{J/K}
\]

Thus, the total entropy change of the universe is:

\[
\Delta S_{\text{total}} = \Delta S_{\text{system}} + \Delta S_{\text{surroundings}} = 2.88 + (-2.88) = 0
\]

The question asks for the total change in entropy, which refers to the universe (system + surroundings). Therefore, the total entropy change is zero.

The correct answer is:

**G: 0**

Answer: G
