Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because equilibrium problems can be tricky. Let's see what it's asking.

The reaction is nitrogen gas plus hydrogen gas forming ammonia. The equation is N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g). The equilibrium constant K is given as 2.37 ×10^-14 at 1000 K. And the setup is that we inject one mole each of N2 and H2 into a 1-liter container at 1000 K. We need to find the percentage of H2 that's converted to NH3 at equilibrium.

Hmm, since the container is 1 liter, the concentrations would just be the moles because concentration is moles per liter. So initial concentrations are [N2] = 1 M, [H2] = 1 M, and [NH3] = 0 M.

I remember that for these kinds of problems, setting up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) is the way to go. Let me try that.

So initial:
[N2] = 1 M
[H2] = 1 M
[NH3] = 0 M

Change will be based on the reaction. Let's say the change is x. For every mole of N2 that reacts, it produces 2 moles of NH3. So the changes would be:

[N2] decreases by x → 1 - x
[H2] decreases by 3x → 1 - 3x
[NH3] increases by 2x → 2x

Wait, but wait a second. K is really small here, 2.37e-14. That's a tiny number, so the reaction doesn't favor products much. So the extent of reaction x should be very small. So maybe I can approximate that 1 - x ≈ 1, and 1 - 3x ≈ 1 as well? Because x is so small that subtracting it from 1 is negligible.

So the equilibrium concentrations would be approximately:
[N2] ≈ 1
[H2] ≈ 1
[NH3] ≈ 2x

Now, the expression for K is K = [NH3]^2 / ([N2][H2]^3). Plugging in the approximated values:

K ≈ ( (2x)^2 ) / (1 * (1)^3 ) = (4x²) / 1 = 4x²

We know K is 2.37e-14, so:

4x² = 2.37e-14 → x² = (2.37e-14) / 4 → x² ≈ 5.925e-15 → x ≈ sqrt(5.925e-15)

Let me calculate that. Square root of 5.925e-15. Hmm, sqrt(5.925) is about 2.435, and sqrt(1e-15) is 1e-7.5, which is 3.16e-8. So 2.435 * 3.16e-8 ≈ let's see, 2.435 * 3.16 ≈ 7.7, so x ≈ 7.7e-8.

Wait, but wait, actually, sqrt(5.925e-15) is sqrt(5.925) * 1e-7.5, which is sqrt(5.925) * 1e-7.5. Let me compute 1e-7.5. Since 1e-7 is 1e-7, 1e-8 is 0.1e-7. So 1e-7.5 is about 3.16e-8. So sqrt(5.925) is about 2.435, so 2.435 * 3.16e-8 ≈ 7.7e-8.

So x ≈ 7.7e-8.

But wait, 7.7e-8 is a very small number, so our assumption that x is negligible compared to 1 is valid. So the approximation holds.

Now, the question is about the percentage of H2 converted. The initial moles of H2 are 1. At equilibrium, [H2] is 1 - 3x. So the moles converted would be 3x, and the percentage converted is (3x / 1) * 100%.

So 3x is 3 * 7.7e-8 = 2.31e-7. So percentage is (2.31e-7) * 100% ≈ 2.31e-5%. That's 0.0000231%, which is way too low. But none of the options are that low. Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the setup. Let me check the ICE table again. Oh wait, no, the change in H2 is 3x because the stoichiometry is 3 H2 per reaction. So the moles of H2 consumed are 3x, so the percent conversion is (3x)/(initial moles) *100%.

Wait, but wait, 3x is 3*(7.7e-8) which is 2.31e-7. So 2.31e-7 /1 = 2.31e-7, times 100 is 2.31e-5 percent. That's 0.0000231%, which is way lower than any of the options given. But the options are all above 2%, the closest being J: 2.0%. But wait, my calculation says it's 0.000023%, which is way lower.

Hmm, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the approximation isn't valid because K is so small that x is negligible, so the reaction doesn't proceed much, but perhaps I should set up the problem without approximations and see.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the expression for K.

Wait, let me write the correct equilibrium expression. K = [NH3]^2/([N2][H2]^3).

So, without approximation, the equilibrium concentrations are:

[N2] = 1 - x

[H2] = 1 - 3x

[NH3] = 2x

Then, the K expression is:

( (2x)^2 ) / ( (1 - x)(1 - 3x)^3 ) ) = 2.37e-14.

But since K is very small, x is very small, so 1 - x ≈ 1, and 1 -3x ≈1. So the denominator is approximately 1.

So K ≈ 4x² = 2.37e-14 → x²= (2.37e-14)/4 → x²=5.925e-15 → x= sqrt(5.925e-15) ≈ 7.7e-8 as before.

So x is 7.7e-8, so 3x is 2.31e-7. So H2 converted is 2.31e-7 moles. Since initial moles of H2 is 1, the percent conversion is (2.31e-7/1)*100% = 2.31e-5%, which is 0.0000231%. That's way below 1%, but the options don't have anything that low.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me check the reaction again. It's 1 mole N2 + 3 moles H2 → 2 moles NH3. So for each mole of reaction, 3 moles H2 are consumed. So if x is the extent, then H2 consumed is 3x.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the total moles of H2 is 1 initially, and if 3x is consumed, then the remaining is 1 - 3x. But the percent conversion is (3x)/(1) *100%.

But according to this, 3x is about 2.3e-7, which is 0.000023%. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in another step.

Wait, maybe I should not approximate. Let's try without approximations.

Set up the exact equation:

K = (2x)^2 / [ (1 - x)(1 - 3x)^3 ] = 2.37e-14.

But this would lead to a quartic equation which is complicated, but perhaps with such small x, the denominator is approximately 1, so the same as before. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, but then the percentage is negligible, which is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the initial setup. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem says "what percent of the H2 will be converted to NH3 at equilibrium." So the question is about the conversion of H2. So moles of H2 converted is 3x, so the percent is (3x / initial H2) *100 = 3x *100%.

Initially, H2 is 1 mole. So 3x *100% is the percentage converted.

Wait, but in my calculation, x is about 7.7e-8, so 3x is 2.31e-7. 2.31e-7 *100 = 2.31e-5%, which is 0.0000231%. That's way too low. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the reaction is going in reverse? No, because K is given for the reaction written as N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3. So K is for that direction.

Wait another thing: perhaps I should have considered that the reaction is written as 1 mole N2 and 3 H2 forming 2 NH3. So the ICE table is correct.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation of x.

Wait, K is 2.37e-14. So:

4x² = 2.37e-14 → x² = 5.925e-15 → x = sqrt(5.925e-15) = sqrt(5.925)*1e-7.5.

Wait, sqrt(5.925) is about 2.435, and 1e-7.5 is 3.16e-8 as before. So 2.435 * 3.16e-8 ≈ 7.7e-8. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe the problem is that I should have considered that the initial moles are in a 1-liter container, so concentrations are 1 M each. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the answer isn't among the options. That can't be right because the options are given.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for K. Let me double-check: for the reaction aA + bB → cC, K is [C]^c / ( [A]^a [B]^b ). So for N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3, it's [NH3]^2 / ( [N2][H2]^3 ), which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the given K is very small, so very little product is formed, but the options don't reflect that. So maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is using Kp instead of Kc. But the problem says K is given, and the reaction is in terms of concentrations (moles per liter), so Kc is used. So that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reverse reaction. If K is so small, perhaps the reverse reaction is favored, but that doesn't make sense because K is for the given reaction. So the forward reaction is not favored, so little NH3 is formed, so little H2 is consumed.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial assumption that x is negligible isn't the case. But K is 1e-14, which is super small, so x must be very small.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me compute it again.

x² = 5.925e-15 → x = sqrt(5.925e-15). Let me compute this more accurately.

5.925e-15 is 5.925 × 1e-15. The square root is sqrt(5.925) × sqrt(1e-15) = approx 2.434 × 1e-7.5.

Wait, sqrt(1e-15) is (1e-15)^(1/2) = 1e-7.5 = 3.1623e-8.

So 2.434 * 3.1623e-8 = let's calculate that.

2.434 * 3.1623 ≈ 7.7, so 7.7e-8.

So x ≈ 7.7e-8 M.

So 3x is 2.31e-7 M. So the moles of H2 consumed is 2.31e-7, which is 0.000000231 moles. Since the initial moles of H2 is 1, the percent conversion is 0.0231%.

Wait, but that's 0.0231%, which is approximately 0.02%, which is 2.0e-5 *100 = 2.3e-3%. Still, that's way below any of the options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option J is 2.0%, which is 2.0% conversion. But according to my calculation, it's 0.023%, which is 0.023%. So that's two orders of magnitude lower than option J. So that's not matching.

Is there a mistake in my calculation? Did I mix up millimoles and moles or something? No, because the container is 1 liter, so moles equal concentrations.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the equation without the approximation. Let me try that.

The exact expression is:

( (2x)^2 ) / ( (1 - x)(1 - 3x)^3 ) = 2.37e-14.

But since x is so small, 1 - x ≈ 1 and 1 - 3x ≈1, so it's same as before. So the same result.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry of the reaction. Let me check: 1 mole of N2 and 3 of H2 produce 2 of NH3. So for each x, N2 decreases by x, H2 by 3x, NH3 increases by 2x. That's correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem is using Kp instead of Kc. Let me think about that. If K were given as Kp, then concentrations would be in terms of partial pressures, but the problem gives concentrations in a 1-liter container, so Kc is appropriate.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm using the wrong value for K. Let me re-read: K = 2.37 ×10^-14. So yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that I should consider that the volume is 1 liter, so concentrations are in mol/L, which they are.

Wait, maybe I should compute the percentage of H2 that is converted. So if 3x is the moles of H2 consumed, the percentage is (3x / initial moles of H2) *100. Initial moles of H2 is 1, so 3x *100.

So 3x is 2.31e-7, so 2.31e-7 *100 = 2.31e-5%, which is 0.0000231%. That's way below any of the options.

Wait, the options are all above 2%, so perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the exponent in K. Let me check: K is 2.37 ×10^-14. That's correct, a very small number.

Wait, maybe the given K is 2.37e14 instead of 1e-14. But the problem states 2.37 ×10^-14. So that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is written in reverse, so K would be 1/(2.37e-14) which is a huge number, but the problem doesn't say that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is NH3 decomposing. But no, the K is given for the reaction as written.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to provide K as 2.37e-14 at 1000 K, but I have to reverse the reaction, but that wouldn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial moles are 1 each of N2 and H2, but perhaps the stoichiometry leads to a different initial approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is in the way I'm calculating the percentage. Wait, the question asks for the percentage of H2 converted. So if 3x is the amount of H2 consumed, then (3x)/(1) *100% is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in solving for x. Let me recompute:

x² = (2.37e-14)/4 → 5.925e-15 → x = sqrt(5.925e-15) = sqrt(5.925)*1e-7.5 → 2.435 * 3.162e-8 → 7.7e-8.

So 3x = 2.31e-7. So 2.31e-7 *100 = 2.31e-5% → 0.0000231%. That's 0.00231% which is 2.31e-3%.

Wait, that's way lower than any option. So perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong K expression. Alternatively, perhaps I confused the exponents.

Wait, perhaps K is 2.37e-14, but I thought it's 2.37 ×10^14. Let me recheck: the question says K = 2.37 ×10^-14. So yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction in terms of pressure instead of concentration, but no, the problem gives moles in a 1-liter container, so Kc is appropriate.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should consider that the reaction is at equilibrium when some of the reactants are converted, but perhaps the assumption that x is negligible is incorrect, but that leads to a higher x, which would make the percentage higher. But that doesn't seem to be the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equation without the approximation.

So:

( (2x)^2 ) / ( (1 - x)(1 - 3x)^3 ) = 2.37e-14.

But even without approximation, solving this equation is difficult. Let's expand the denominator:

(1 - x
