Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Hume question. Hmm, Hume's philosophy... I remember he was a Scottish Enlightenment thinker, right? He talked a lot about morality and human nature. The question is about what someone unaffected by images of human happiness or misery would be indifferent to.

Wait, the options are A through J. Let me think about Hume's views. I recall that Hume believed morality is based on sentiment, not reason. So, if someone doesn't feel anything when seeing others happy or miserable, that affects their moral sense.

In his Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals, Hume discusses how we approve of virtues because they contribute to the well-being of society or the person. So, if a person is indifferent to others' happiness, they wouldn't care about virtue and vice because those are tied to how actions affect others' well-being.

Looking at the options, option C is about virtue and vice. That makes sense because if you don't care about others' happiness or misery, you wouldn't see virtue as good or vice as bad. So, the indifferent person would be indifferent to virtue and vice.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question says the person is unaffected by images of human happiness or misery. So, they don't feel anything when seeing others happy or suffering. Hume's moral theory says that moral distinctions are derived from our sentiments regarding the useful or agreeable effects of actions. If someone doesn't feel anything towards others' feelings, they wouldn't have the same moral sentiments.

So, yes, they would be indifferent to virtue and vice because those are based on promoting happiness and preventing misery. Therefore, the correct answer should be C.

The question asks what a person unaffected by images of human happiness or misery would be indifferent to, according to Hume. Hume argued that morality is rooted in sentiment, particularly feelings of happiness and misery. Virtue and vice are approved or disapproved based on their impact on well-being. If someone is indifferent to others' happiness or misery, they would also be indifferent to virtue and vice, as these concepts are tied to promoting or preventing suffering.

Answer: C
