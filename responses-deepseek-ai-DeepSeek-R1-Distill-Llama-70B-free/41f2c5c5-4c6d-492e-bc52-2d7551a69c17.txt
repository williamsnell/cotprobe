Options:

A: Backward conditioning results in the conditioned stimulus becoming irrelevant.
B: Backward conditioning is the same as forward conditioning in terms of effectiveness.
C: Backward conditioning has no impact on the response to the conditioned stimulus.
D: Backward conditioning strengthens the response to the conditioned stimulus.
E: Backward conditioning weakens the unconditioned response.
F: Backward conditioning usually results in inhibitory conditioning.
G: Backward conditioning is highly effective.
H: Backward conditioning usually leads to excitatory conditioning.
I: Backward conditioning is a procedure where the conditioned stimulus is presented long after the unconditioned stimulus.
J: Backward conditioning enhances the unconditioned stimulus's effect without involving the conditioned stimulus.

Okay, so I have this question about backward conditioning. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my psychology terms, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about classical conditioning.

Classical conditioning is all about associating stimuli with responses. I remember Pavlov's dogs where the bell (conditioned stimulus) was rung before the food (unconditioned stimulus), and eventually the bell alone made the dogs salivate. That's forward conditioning, right? The CS comes before the US.

But the question is about backward conditioning. From what I remember, backward conditioning is when the unconditioned stimulus comes before the conditioned stimulus. So the order is reversed. But wait, how does that work? If the US is presented first, does the CS that comes after it have any effect?

I think in forward conditioning, the CS predicts the US, so the association is strong. But in backward conditioning, since the CS comes after the US, maybe the brain doesn't make as strong a connection. Or maybe it's even confusing for the organism. 

The question also asks about the usual effect of backward conditioning. I seem to recall that backward conditioning is less effective than forward. But what exactly happens? I think it might lead to inhibitory conditioning. Oh wait, inhibitory conditioning is when the conditioned stimulus actually suppresses a response. Like in Pavlov's experiments, if you ring the bell but don't present food, after a while the salivation decreases. That's extinction, which is inhibitory.

So in backward conditioning, since the CS follows the US, perhaps the organism learns that the CS doesn't predict the US. So it might inhibit the response. So the usual effect is inhibitory conditioning.

Looking at the options now. I need to pick the correct description and effect.

Option A says backward conditioning makes the CS irrelevant. That might be part of it, but I'm not sure if that's the main effect.

Option B says it's as effective as forward, which I don't think is right because forward is more effective.

Option C says no impact, which doesn't seem correct because there's some effect, just different.

Option D says it strengthens the response. No, I think it weakens or inhibits.

Option E says it weakens the unconditioned response. Wait, the US is the unconditioned stimulus; does backward conditioning affect that? I'm not sure, but maybe it affects the conditioned response, not the unconditioned.

Option F says it usually results in inhibitory conditioning. That sounds right.

Option G says it's highly effective. No, forward is more effective.

Option H says it leads to excitatory conditioning. That's the opposite; excitatory is when the CS causes a stronger response, like in forward.

Option I says the CS is presented long after the US. Yes, that's the definition of backward conditioning.

Option J talks about enhancing the US without the CS, which doesn't seem right.

So the question has two parts. First, describe backward conditioning. The correct description would be option I. But the second part is the usual effect, which would be inhibitory conditioning, option F.

Wait, the question is asking two things: describe the procedure and the usual effect, including an explanation of inhibitory conditioning. So the correct answer should cover both. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, option F is about the effect (inhibitory), and option I describes the procedure. But the question is a single choice, so which option covers both?

Wait, the options are separate. The question is phrased as two parts: describe the procedure and its usual effect, and include an explanation of inhibitory. So the answer should first explain backward conditioning as CS after US, and then say that the usual effect is inhibitory.

Looking at the options:

Option I describes the procedure correctly. So the first part is correct in I.

But the question is about both description and effect. So which option combines both?

Wait, the options are single answers. So the correct answer must be the one that correctly describes backward conditioning and its usual effect.

Option F says "backward conditioning usually results in inhibitory conditioning." That seems right. Because backward conditioning leads to inhibitory effects.

Wait, but the first part of the question is to describe backward conditioning. So the correct answer should have both the description and the effect. But each option is a statement, so perhaps F is the answer because it correctly describes the effect, which is inhibitory.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because it states the usual effect. Let me think about the structure of the question: it asks to describe the procedure and what the usual effect is, including inhibitory.

So the answer would be I and F? But each option is separate. Wait, no, each option is a single choice.

Wait, perhaps the answer is I for the procedure and F for the effect. But the options are individual, so I have to choose one option that correctly answers the question.

The question asks two things: 1) describe backward conditioning procedure; 2) what's the usual effect, including explanation of inhibitory.

Wait, perhaps option I correctly describes the procedure (CS presented after US), but the effect part would be F. But since each option is a separate sentence, perhaps the correct answer is F because it answers the effect part, which is the second part of the question. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, maybe the backward conditioning's usual effect is inhibitory, so F is correct. Also, the description in I is correct, but the question is about both the procedure and the effect.

Wait, the options are each individual statements, so I need to pick the one that best answers the entire question. So the correct answer would be F.

But wait, another approach: The question starts with "describe a backward conditioning procedure." So the first part is the procedure. Then, "what is the usual effect... include inhibitory."

So perhaps the correct answer is I for the procedure and F for the effect. But since it's a single answer, perhaps the correct answer combines both, but looking at the options, none of them combine both.

Wait, let me read the options again.

Option I: Backward conditioning is a procedure where the conditioned stimulus is presented long after the unconditioned stimulus. That seems correct as the procedure.

Option F: Backward conditioning usually results in inhibitory conditioning.

So the question is asking for two things: the procedure and the effect. So the correct answer would be both I and F, but each is a separate option. So perhaps the correct answer is F, but I is also correct for the procedure.

Wait, the question is phrased as a single question, so perhaps the correct answer is F, which combines the effect part.

Alternatively, the question is asking for the effect and an explanation of inhibitory conditioning. So the correct answer would be F, which says the usual effect is inhibitory.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F. Because backward conditioning usually leads to inhibitory conditioning. That's the effect.

So, putting it all together, the answer is F.

Backward conditioning is a procedure in classical conditioning where the conditioned stimulus (CS) is presented after the unconditioned stimulus (US), unlike forward conditioning where the CS precedes the US. This reversed order makes it less effective than forward conditioning because the CS does not reliably predict the US. The usual effect of backward conditioning is inhibitory conditioning, where the CS learns to suppress or inhibit the conditioned response rather than elicit it. This occurs because the brain associates the CS with the absence of the US, leading to a weakened or inhibitory response.

Option F correctly captures this by stating that backward conditioning usually results in inhibitory conditioning.

Answer: F
