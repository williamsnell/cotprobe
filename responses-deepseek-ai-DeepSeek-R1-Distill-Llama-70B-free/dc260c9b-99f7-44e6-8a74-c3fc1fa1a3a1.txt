Question:

There is an appreciative sigh throughout the audience in the "mad\textquotedblright scene of "LuciadiLammermoor", when the soprano hits high C. On the musical scale, high C has a frequency of 1,024 sec-^1 . Assuming the velocity of sound in air is 3.317 × 10^4 cmsec-^1 , compute the wavelength of the high C sound wave.

Options:

A: 12.14 cm
B: 40.96 cm
C: 24.29 cm
D: 8.59 cm
E: 81.92 cm
F: 32.39 cm
G: 64.78 cm
H: 48.59 cm
I: 97.18 cm
J: 16.19 cm

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the wavelength of a high C note in an opera. Hmm, I remember that wavelength, frequency, and velocity are related somehow. Oh right, the formula is velocity equals frequency multiplied by wavelength. Or wait, is it velocity equals wavelength times frequency? Yeah, that sounds right: v = λ * f.

So the problem gives me the frequency of high C as 1024 Hz. And the velocity of sound in air is given as 3.317e4 cm per second. Wait, 3.317 times 10^4 cm/s. Let me write that down. So v is 33170 cm/s? Wait, no, 3.317e4 is 33170 cm/s? Let me check. 10^4 is 10,000, so 3.317 * 10,000 is 33,170 cm/s. Oh wait, but wait, sometimes the speed of sound is around 343 m/s at room temperature, which would be 34300 cm/s. Hmm, but here the given value is 33170 cm/s, so I'll go with that.

The formula I need is λ (lambda) equals v divided by f. So λ = v/f. Got it. So I plug in the numbers.

v is 33170 cm/s, f is 1024 Hz. So λ = 33170 / 1024.

Let me calculate that. Hmm, 33170 divided by 1024. Let me do the division step by step. 1024 times 32 is 32768, because 1024 *30 is 30,720 and 1024*2 is 2048, so 30,720 + 2,048 = 32,768. So 32 times 1024 is 32,768. 

Now, 33,170 minus 32,768 is 402. So that's 32 with a remainder of 402. Now, 402 divided by 1024. Hmm, that's 0.3921875. So total is 32.3921875 cm.

Wait, but let me check that calculation again because when I did 3.317e4, that's 33,170 cm/s. Then 33,170 divided by 1024.

Wait another approach: 1024 is 2^10, which is 1024. So perhaps approximate.

Alternatively, I can compute 33170 / 1024.

Let me see, 33170 ÷ 1024. 

I think 1024 ×32 is 32768, as I said. So 32768 + 402 = 33170.

So 32.3921875 cm. So approximately 32.39 cm.

Looking at the options, option F is 32.39 cm. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the velocity unit. Oh wait, the velocity is given as 3.317 ×10^4 cm/s. So yes, 33170 cm/s. Frequency is 1024 Hz. So dividing gives the wavelength in cm.

Yes, that seems correct. So I think the correct answer is F.

To calculate the wavelength of the high C sound wave, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{v}{f}
\]

where:
- \( v \) is the velocity of sound in air, given as \( 3.317 \times 10^4 \, \text{cm/s} = 33170 \, \text{cm/s} \),
- \( f \) is the frequency of high C, given as \( 1024 \, \text{Hz} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\lambda = \frac{33170}{1024}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\lambda \approx 32.39 \, \text{cm}
\]

Comparing this result with the provided options, the closest match is **32.39 cm**, which corresponds to option **F**.

Answer: F
