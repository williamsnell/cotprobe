Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the expected value of w, which is the number of heads when two coins are tossed. Hmm, expected value... right, that's like the average outcome we'd expect if we did the experiment many times. So the question is asking for ⟨w⟩, which I think is the expectation of w.

Alright, let me think. When you toss two coins, each toss has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). Since the coins are tossed simultaneously, each toss is independent. So the possible outcomes for two coins would be: HH, HT, TH, TT. Wait, wait, how many heads do we get in each case?

Let's list them out. 

1. HH: both are heads. So that's two heads.
2. HT: one head, one tail. So one head.
3. TH: same as HT, one head.
4. TT: no heads, so zero heads.

So the number of possible outcomes is 4, and each outcome is equally likely because each coin is fair, I assume.

Now, for each outcome, we can assign the number of heads (w):

- HH → w=2
- HT → w=1
- TH → w=1
- TT → w=0

So the possible values of w are 0, 1, and 2. Now, to find the expected value, I need to calculate the probability of each w and multiply by the value, then sum them all up.

Let me compute the probabilities:

- P(w=0): This is the case TT. Only one outcome out of four. So probability is 1/4.
- P(w=1): This happens for both HT and TH. That's two outcomes, so 2/4 = 1/2.
- P(w=2): Only HH, so 1/4.

So now, the expected value ⟨w⟩ is:

⟨w⟩ = (0)*(1/4) + (1)*(1/2) + (2)*(1/4)

Calculating each term:

0*(1/4) is 0.

1*(1/2) is 1/2.

2*(1/4) is 2/4, which is 1/2.

Adding them up: 0 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.

Wait, but wait a second. That gives me 1. Let me double-check because sometimes I might mix up the probabilities.

Alternative approach: Since each coin has a 50% chance of being heads, the expected value for one coin is 0.5. Since there are two coins, the total expectation should be 0.5 + 0.5 = 1. Oh, right, that's another way to think about it. The expectation is linear, so adding the expectations of each coin gives the expectation for the sum.

So both methods give me 1. Looking at the options, option B is 1. So the correct answer should be B.

To determine the expected value ⟨w⟩, where w is the number of heads when two coins are tossed, we first identify the possible outcomes and their corresponding values of w:

1. **HH**: Both coins are heads → w = 2  
2. **HT**: One head and one tail → w = 1  
3. **TH**: One head and one tail → w = 1  
4. **TT**: No heads → w = 0  

The possible values of w are therefore 0, 1, and 2. Next, we calculate the probabilities of each outcome:

- **P(w=0)**: Only TT occurs → Probability = 1/4  
- **P(w=1)**: HT or TH occurs → Probability = 2/4 = 1/2  
- **P(w=2)**: Only HH occurs → Probability = 1/4  

The expected value ⟨w⟩ is then computed as:  
\[
\langle w \rangle = (0) \cdot \frac{1}{4} + (1) \cdot \frac{1}{2} + (2) \cdot \frac{1}{4}
\]  
Simplifying:  
\[
\langle w \rangle = 0 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{4} = 0 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1
\]  

Thus, the expected value ⟨w⟩ is 1. This result can also be understood intuitively: each coin has an expected value of 0.5 for landing heads, and the total expectation for two coins is \(0.5 + 0.5 = 1\).  

From the given options, the correct answer is **B: 1**.
