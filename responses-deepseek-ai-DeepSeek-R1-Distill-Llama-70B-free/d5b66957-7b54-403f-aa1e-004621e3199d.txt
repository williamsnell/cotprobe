Okay, so I've got this problem about a parallel-plate capacitor with a dielectric that has a varying relative permittivity. Hmm, I remember that the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is usually given by C = ε₀ε_r * A / d, where A is the area of the plates and d is the separation between them. But wait, in this case, the ε_r isn't constant—it varies with x, the position between the plates.

The relative permittivity ε_r is given by 1/(1 - x²/(3d²)). So, ε_r varies as x changes. That means I can't just use the standard formula directly; I'll probably have to integrate something over the thickness.

I think the approach here is to model the capacitor as a series of infinitesimally thin layers, each with a small thickness dx and a permittivity ε(x) = ε₀ε_r(x). The capacitance of each layer would be dC = ε(x) * A / dx, but since they're in series, the total capacitance would be the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of each dC.

Wait, no, actually, if the dielectric varies continuously, the correct way is to integrate the reciprocal of the capacitance contributions. Because for capacitors in series, 1/C_total = sum(1/C_i), and each C_i is ε₀ε_r(x) A / dx. So 1/C_total would be the integral from 0 to d of (dx)/(ε₀ ε_r(x) A)). Then, the total capacitance is 1 divided by that integral.

So putting it all together, the formula would be:

C = [ integral from 0 to d of (1/(ε₀ ε_r(x))) dx / A ]^-1

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The standard formula for a varying medium is C = (A/ ( integral from 0 to d [ dx / (ε₀ ε_r(x)) ] )) )

Yes, that's right. Because when the permittivity varies with x, the capacitance is the area divided by the integral of dx/(ε₀ ε_r(x)).

So, let me write this out. The capacitance C is:

C = (A) / ( ∫₀^d [1/(ε₀ ε_r(x))] dx )

Given ε_r(x) = 1 / (1 - x²/(3d²) )

So 1/ε_r(x) is (1 - x²/(3d²)).

Substituting that into the integral, the integral becomes ∫₀^d (1 - x²/(3d²)) dx.

Let me compute that integral.

Breaking it down:

∫ [1 - (x²)/(3d²)] dx from 0 to d.

This is equal to ∫ 1 dx - (1/(3d²)) ∫ x² dx, all from 0 to d.

Compute each part:

First integral: ∫1 dx from 0 to d is just d.

Second integral: ∫x² dx is (x³)/3 evaluated from 0 to d, which is d³/3. So (1/(3d²)) * (d³/3) = (d³/3) * 1/(3d²) ) = d/(9).

So the total integral is d - d/9 = (9d -d)/9 = (8d)/9.

So putting it back into the capacitance formula:

C = (A) / [ (8d)/(9 ε₀) ) ] ?

Wait, wait, no, let me check again. Because the integral is ∫ [1/(ε₀ ε_r(x) )] dx = (1/ε₀) ∫ [1/ε_r(x)] dx = (1/ε₀) * (8d/9), as I computed.

So the denominator in C is (8d)/(9 ε₀).

So C = A * (9 ε₀) / (8 d) ) = (9 ε₀ A )/(8 d) )

Wait, no, let's re-express:

Wait, the integral is (8d)/(9), but it's (1/ε₀) times that. So the integral is (8d)/(9 ε₀).

So C = A / [ (8d)/(9 ε₀) ) ] = (9 ε₀ A )/(8 d )

But wait, the standard formula for a capacitor with a dielectric is C = ε₀ ε_r A / d. So in this case, the effective ε_r is such that C = (9/8) (ε₀ A / d) * [something?]

Wait, no, because the integration accounted for the varying ε_r. So the final C is (9 ε₀ A )/(8 d )

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

The options are:

A: (7/5) (ε_va)/(2d) F

Wait, I'm not sure. Wait, the problem gives ε_va, which I think is probably ε₀ multiplied by some area or something? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, looking back, the options: each option is written as something multiplied by {(\epsilon_va) ...}.

Wait, perhaps they wrote ε_va as ε₀ times A? Because in the standard formula, C = ε₀ ε_r A / d. So if ε_va is ε₀ A, then 9/(8) * (ε₀ A ) / d would be (9/8) (ε_va) / d.

Wait, let me check. If ε_va is ε₀ A, then yes.

So in our case, C = (9 ε₀ A )/(8 d ) = (9/8) (ε₀ A) / d = (9/8) (ε_va) / d.

So looking at the options, option I is (9/8) {(\epsilon_va) / d} Farad.

Wait, but let me double-check the options.

Option I: (9/8) (ε_va / d) F.

Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be I.

To solve the problem, we start with the formula for the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor with a varying dielectric permittivity:

\[
C = \frac{A}{\int_0^d \frac{1}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r(x)} dx}
\]

Here, the relative permittivity is given as:

\[
\epsilon_r(x) = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{x^2}{3d^2}}
\]

Thus, the reciprocal of the permittivity is:

\[
\frac{1}{\epsilon_r(x)} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{3d^2}
\]

Substituting this into the integral:

\[
\int_0^d \frac{1}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r(x)} dx = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \int_0^d \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{3d^2}\right) dx
\]

Breaking the integral into two parts:

\[
\int_0^d \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{3d^2}\right) dx = \int_0^d 1 \, dx - \frac{1}{3d^2} \int_0^d x^2 \, dx
\]

1. The first term is:

\[
\int_0^d 1 \, dx = d
\]

2. The second term is:

\[
\frac{1}{3d^2} \int_0^d x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3d^2} \cdot \frac{x^3}{3} \Big|_0^d = \frac{1}{3d^2} \cdot \frac{d^3}{3} = \frac{d}{9}
\]

Combining these results:

\[
\int_0^d \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{3d^2}\right) dx = d - \frac{d}{9} = \frac{8d}{9}
\]

Thus, the capacitance becomes:

\[
C = \frac{A}{\frac{8d}{9\epsilon_0}} = \frac{9\epsilon_0 A}{8d}
\]

If we define \(\epsilon_{va} = \epsilon_0 A\), then:

\[
C = \frac{9}{8} \cdot \frac{\epsilon_{va}}{d}
\]

This matches option **I**, which is:

\[
\text{I: } \frac{9}{8} \cdot \frac{\epsilon_{va}}{d} \, \text{Farad}
\]

**Answer: I**
