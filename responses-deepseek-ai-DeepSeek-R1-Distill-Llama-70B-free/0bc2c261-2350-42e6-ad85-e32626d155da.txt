Question:

The first ionization energy for a neutral atom of chlorine is 1.25 MJ/mol and the first ionization energy for a neutral atom of argon is 1.52 MJ/mol. How would the first ionization energy value for a neutral atom of potassum compare to those values?

Options:

A: It would be greater than both because the size of a potassium atom is smaller than an atom of either chlorine or argon.
B: It would be greater than both because the atomic radius of potassium is greater than that of either chlorine or argon.
C: It would be less than both because there are more electrons in potassium, meaning they repel each other more effectively and less energy is needed to remove one.
D: It would be less than chlorine but greater than argon because the atomic radius of potassium is smaller than that of argon but larger than that of chlorine.
E: It would be greater than chlorine but less than argon because the atomic number of potassium falls between those of chlorine and argon.
F: It would be greater than both because potassium carries a greater nuclear charge then either chlorine or argon.
G: It would be equal to that of argon because they belong to the same period in the periodic table.
H: It would be less than both because a valence electron of potassium is farther from the nucleus than one of either chlorine or argon.
I: It would be equal to that of chlorine because both are in the same group in the periodic table.
J: It would be less than both because potassium has fewer protons to attract electrons, making it easier to remove one.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about ionization energies of different elements. Hmm, I remember that ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom. The question is comparing the first ionization energy of potassium (K) with chlorine (Cl) and argon (Ar).

The given data: Chlorine's first IE is 1.25 MJ/mol and Argon's is 1.52 MJ/mol. I need to figure out where K's IE stands relative to these.

So, I think about the periodic trends. Ionization energy generally increases across a period and decreases down a group. Let me recall the positions of these elements. Potassium is in Group 1, Period 4. Chlorine is in Group 17, Period 3. Argon is a noble gas in Period 4, same as K.

Wait, but K is in the fourth period, while Cl is in the third. So moving from left to right across a period, IE increases. Also, down a group, IE decreases because the valence electrons are further from the nucleus, so less energy is needed to remove them.

Potassium is a larger atom than both Cl and Ar because it's below them in the same group. Wait, no, K is in group 1, Cl is group 17, same period as Ar (which is group 18). Oh wait, Ar is period 4, same as K. Cl is period 3.

So, K has a larger atomic radius than both Cl and Ar. Because K is in the fourth period, so larger than Cl (third). And Ar is also in the fourth period but is a noble gas, so maybe K is larger than Ar? Because in the same period, group 1 elements are larger than group 18.

So atomic radius: K > Ar > Cl?

Wait, no. Let me think again. In the same period, atomic radius decreases from left to right. So in period 4, K is group 1, then towards group 18 (Ar). So K is larger than Ar. So K's atomic radius is bigger than both Cl and Ar.

Ionization energy is lower for larger atoms because the valence electrons are farther from the nucleus and more shielded. So K, being larger than both Cl and Ar, should have a lower IE than both.

Looking at the options, which ones say K's IE is less than both Cl and Ar?

Option C says it's less than both because K has more electrons, implying more repulsion. Wait, but K has more electrons, but the valence electrons are what matter. K has a single valence electron, which is in the 4th period. Cl has seven valence electrons in the third. Ar has a full shell, so maybe that's why its IE is higher.

Wait, the IE for Ar is higher than Cl. So, IE generally increases across a period. So in period 2, the noble gases have higher IE than the halogens. So in period 3, Ar is in period 4, Cl in period 3.

Wait, no. Wait, Cl is period 3, Ar is period 4. So K is period 4, same as Ar.

In period 4, K is on the far left, so IE increases as you move right. So K's IE should be lower than Ar's because Ar is on the far right. So K's IE is lower than Ar's, but what about Cl?

Cl is in period 3, group 17. So across period 3, IE increases from left to right, so Cl has a high IE for its period. But K is in period 4, so perhaps K's IE is lower than Cl's? Because moving down a group (like from Cl in period 3 to K in period 4, which is not same group though), but K is group 1, which is different from Cl's group 17.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of their positions. K is in period 4, group 1. Cl is period 3, group 17. Ar is period 4, group 18.

So, IE increases across a period, so group 1 (K) has lower IE than group 17 and 18. So K's IE is lower than both Cl and Ar. Because Cl is high in group 17, so for period 3, Cl's IE is higher than, say, Na in period 3, group 1. But K is in period 4, group 1, which is lower than Ar, which is period 4, group 18.

Wait, but the given values are Cl:1.25, Ar:1.52. So Cl's IE is lower than Ar's.

Wait, but wait, K's IE should be lower than Cl's because K is in a higher period (assuming group 1 trends), but wait, Cl is in group 17, period 3, K is group 1, period 4. So for group 1 elements, IE decreases as you go down the group. So K should have lower IE than Na, which is period 3, group 1.

But I'm not sure how K's IE compares to Cl and Ar. Alternatively, maybe K's IE is lower than both because it's a group 1 metal with a large atomic radius. So the valence electron is farther from the nucleus, making it easier to remove, thus lower IE.

Yes, that makes sense. So K's IE should be less than both Cl and Ar.

Now looking at the options:

Option H: It would be less than both because a valence electron of K is farther from the nucleus than one of either Cl or Ar.

Yes, that sounds correct. Because K is larger than both, so the valence electron is farther, so IE is lower.

Option C says it's less than both because more electrons, so more repel. But more electrons doesn't directly mean more repulsion for the valence electrons. The shielding effect is more about the distance and the number of electron shells.

So the correct answer should be H.

The first ionization energy (IE) is the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom. The question compares the IE of potassium (K) with chlorine (Cl) and argon (Ar). The given IE values are 1.25 MJ/mol for Cl and 1.52 MJ/mol for Ar. To determine K's IE relative to these, we analyze periodic trends.

Ionization energy generally increases across a period and decreases down a group. Potassium (K) is in Group 1, Period 4, while chlorine (Cl) is in Group 17, Period 3, and argon (Ar) is in Group 18, Period 4. Atomic radius decreases across a period and increases down a group. K has a larger atomic radius than both Cl and Ar because it is in the same period as Ar but is a Group 1 element, which is larger than noble gases in the same period.

Since K's valence electron is farther from the nucleus and more shielded, it requires less energy to remove, resulting in a lower IE compared to both Cl and Ar. This aligns with the periodic trend that IE decreases down a group and increases across a period.

Analyzing the options, Option H correctly states that K's IE is less than both Cl and Ar because the valence electron of K is farther from the nucleus than that of either Cl or Ar.

Answer: H
