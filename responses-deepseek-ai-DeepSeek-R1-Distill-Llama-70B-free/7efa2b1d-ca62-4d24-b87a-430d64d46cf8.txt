Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the inverse Laplace transforms for two functions. Let me think step by step about how to approach this.

The problem is part (a) and part (b). Let's start with part (a): L^{-1} { 2s / (s² +1)² }.

Hmm, I remember that Laplace transforms often involve looking up standard forms or using properties like differentiation or integration in the Laplace domain. For part (a), the function is 2s divided by (s squared plus one) squared. So, I can write this as 2s/(s²+1)².

Looking at the denominator, (s²+1) squared makes me think about the Laplace transform of functions involving sine or cosine, since those often have denominators with s²+1. Also, I remember that the Laplace transform of t*f(t) is F'(s)/s, but I'm not sure that's directly applicable here.

Wait, another thought: maybe I can express the function as a derivative. Because the derivative of 1/(s²+1) with respect to s would bring down a factor involving s, which might match the numerator here.

Let's compute the derivative of 1/(s² +1). The derivative d/ds [1/(s²+1)] = (-2s)/(s²+1)^2. Oh wait, that's exactly the denominator part here. So our function is 2s/(s²+1)^2. Let me see: 2s/(s²+1)^2 equals -1 times [ derivative of 1/(s²+1) ].

Wait, because d/ds [1/(s²+1)] is (-2s)/(s²+1)^2. So 2s/(s²+1)^2 = - [ derivative of 1/(s²+1) ].

So the function in part (a) is 2s/(s²+1)^2 = - d/ds [1/(s²+1)].

Now, I remember that the Laplace transform of t f(t) is -F'(s), right? Because the Laplace transform of t f(t) is ∫_{0}^{∞} e^{-st} t f(t) dt = -F'(s). So if F(s) = 1/(s²+1), then F'(s) is the derivative, which we found as (-2s)/(s²+1)^2. So F'(s) = (-2s)/(s²+1)^2. So 2s/(s²+1)^2 would be -F'(s).

Wait, so 2s/(s²+1)^2 = -F'(s). So L^{-1} { 2s/(s²+1)^2 } = L^{-1} { -F'(s) }.

But the inverse Laplace of -F'(s) is t times the inverse Laplace of F(s). Because L^{-1} { F'(s) } = -t f(t), so L^{-1} { -F'(s) } = t f(t).

Wait, let me think again. The standard formula is L { t f(t) } = -F'(s). So, if I have F'(s), then L^{-1} { F'(s) } = -t f(t). So, in this case, our function is -F'(s) because 2s/(s²+1)^2 = - F'(s). So L^{-1} { -F'(s) } = L^{-1} { 2s/(s²+1)^2 } = t f(t), because F(s) = 1/(s²+1) has inverse Laplace sin t. So, f(t) is sin t.

Putting it all together, the inverse Laplace of part (a) should be t sin t.

Wait, so that's part (a) done. So for part (a), the answer is t sin t. Now looking at the options, option A starts with t sin t. But let me also check part (b) to make sure.

Part (b) is L^{-1} { 1 / sqrt(s) }. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this. I remember that the Laplace transform of 1/sqrt(s) is related to the error function or something involving a square root in the time domain. Alternatively, I think the inverse Laplace of 1/sqrt(s) is 1/(sqrt(π t)).

Wait, let me think about the Laplace transform of t^{-1/2}. The Laplace transform of t^{n-1} is Γ(n)/s^n, where Γ is the gamma function. So for n=1/2, Γ(1/2) is sqrt(π), so the Laplace transform of t^{-1/2} is sqrt(π) / sqrt(s). So, if we have 1/sqrt(s), then the inverse Laplace would be (1/sqrt(π)) * t^{-1/2}.

Wait, let me check that again. Because L{ t^{k} } = Γ(k+1)/s^{k+1} }, for k > -1. So for k = -1/2, L{ t^{-1/2} } = Γ(1/2) / s^{1/2} } = sqrt(π) / sqrt(s). So to get 1/sqrt(s), we can write 1/sqrt(s) = (1/sqrt(π)) * sqrt(π)/sqrt(s), so that would be (1/sqrt(π)) times the Laplace transform of t^{-1/2}. So the inverse Laplace of 1/sqrt(s) is (1/sqrt(π)) t^{-1/2}, which is 1/(sqrt(π t)).

So part (b) would have the inverse Laplace transform of 1/sqrt(s) as (1/sqrt(π t)).

Now looking back at the options. Let's see:

Option A: t sin t, (1 / sqrt(π)) * (1 / sqrt(t)).

That matches both parts (a) and (b). So option A is the correct choice.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. The options are labeled (a) and (b), but the way the question is written, each option provides answers for both. So for part (a), our conclusion is t sin t. For part (b), 1/(sqrt(π t)).

Looking at the options: option A has (a) t sin t and (b) (1/sqrt(π)) * (1/sqrt(t)), which matches exactly. So option A is correct.

To find the inverse Laplace transforms for the given functions:

### Part (a): \( \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{ \frac{2s}{(s^2 + 1)^2} \right\} \)

1. The function \( \frac{2s}{(s^2 + 1)^2} \) can be expressed as \( -\frac{d}{ds} \left( \frac{1}{s^2 + 1} \right) \), since:
   \[
   \frac{d}{ds} \left( \frac{1}{s^2 + 1} \right) = \frac{-2s}{(s^2 + 1)^2}.
   \]
   Therefore, \( \frac{2s}{(s^2 + 1)^2} = -\frac{d}{ds} \left( \frac{1}{s^2 + 1} \right).

2. Using the property of Laplace transforms, \( \mathcal{L}^{-1} \{ -F'(s) \} = t f(t) \), where \( F(s) = \frac{1}{s^2 + 1} \) and \( f(t) = \sin(t) \). Thus:
   \[
   \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{ \frac{2s}{(s^2 + 1)^2} \right\} = t \sin(t).
   \]

### Part (b): \( \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{ \frac{1}{\sqrt{s}} \right\} \)

1. The Laplace transform of \( t^{-1/2} \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt{s}} \), where \( \Gamma(1/2) = \sqrt{\pi} \). Therefore, to find the inverse Laplace transform of \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{s}} \), we scale appropriately:
   \[
   \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{ \frac{1}{\sqrt{s}} \right\} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi t}}.
   \]

### Matching with the Options

- For part (a), the inverse Laplace transform is \( t \sin(t) \), which matches the first part of option A.
- For part (b), the inverse Laplace transform is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi t}} \), which matches the second part of option A.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A: \( t \sin(t), \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{t}} \)**.
