Okay, so I've got this integral to solve: the integral from a to b of dx divided by the square root of (x - a)(b - x). Hmm, I remember that integrals involving square roots in the denominator can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can find a substitution that simplifies it.

Wait, the expression under the square root is (x - a)(b - x). Let me think about that. That can be rewritten as (a - x)(x - b), but maybe another approach is better. Oh right, (x - a)(b - x) is the same as -(x - a)(x - b), which might remind me of a quadratic form. Wait, but maybe a trigonometric substitution would work here.

Alternatively, I've heard that the integral of 1 over sqrt[(x - a)(b - x)] dx from a to b is a standard form. I think it's related to the Beta function or something like that. Oh wait, maybe I can use substitution to make it look like a Beta function integral.

Let me try substituting t = (x - a)/(b - a). Then when x = a, t is 0, and when x = b, t is 1. That makes the limits of integration from 0 to 1, which is convenient.

Rewriting dx in terms of dt: since t = (x - a)/(b - a), then x = a + (b - a)t. So dx = (b - a) dt.

Now substituting into the integral:

The denominator becomes sqrt[(x - a)(b - x)] = sqrt[ (a + (b - a)t - a) (b - (a + (b - a)t) ) ]

Simplify each part inside the sqrt:

(x - a) = (b - a)t

(b - x) = b - a - (b - a)t = (b - a)(1 - t)

So the denominator becomes sqrt[ (b - a)t * (b - a)(1 - t) ) ] = sqrt[ (b - a)^2 t(1 - t) ) ] = (b - a) sqrt[ t(1 - t) ]

So the integral becomes:

Integral from t=0 to t=1 of [ (b - a) dt ] / [ (b - a) sqrt(t(1 - t)) ) ] 

Wait, the (b - a) terms cancel out because (b - a) is in numerator and denominator. So we have:

Integral from 0 to 1 of dt / sqrt(t(1 - t))

Hmm, that's a standard integral. I think the integral of 1/sqrt(t(1 - t)) dt from 0 to 1 is a known value. Alternatively, it's related to the Beta function or Gamma function.

Wait, the Beta function B(p, q) is the integral from 0 to 1 of t^{p-1} (1 - t)^{q-1} dt. So in this case, the integrand is t^{-1/2} (1 - t)^{-1/2}, so p = 1/2, q=1/2.

So B(1/2, 1/2) = integral from 0 to 1 of t^{-1/2} (1 - t)^{-1/2} dt. Which is exactly our integral.

And I remember that B(p, q) = Γ(p)Γ(q)/Γ(p + q). So for p = q = 1/2, Γ(1/2) is sqrt(π), and Γ(1/2 + 1/2) = Γ(1) = 1. So B(1/2, 1/2) = (sqrt(π) * sqrt(π)) / 1 )= π.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, sqrt(π) times sqrt(π) is π, so yes, B(1/2, 1/2) = π.

Wait no, that can't be right. Because I thought the Beta function with 1/2 and 1/2 is π. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the integral of 1/sqrt(t(1 - t)) dt from 0 to 1 is π. Because I remember that the integral of t^{-1/2} (1 - t)^{-1/2} dt from 0 to 1 is Beta(1/2, 1/2) which is π.

So that would make the value of the original integral equal to π.

But wait, let me think again. Because the substitution I did led me to the integral from 0 to 1 of dt / sqrt(t(1 - t)), which is equal to π. So the original integral is equal to π.

Wait, but π is approximately 3.1415926535... So looking at the options, option G is 3.1415926, which matches π. So the answer should be G.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution. Let me double-check the substitution steps.

I set t = (x - a)/(b - a), so x = a + (b - a)t, dx = (b - a) dt. Then the denominator becomes sqrt[(x - a)(b - x)] = sqrt[ (b - a)^2 t(1 - t) ] = (b - a) sqrt(t(1 - t)).

So the integral becomes (b - a) dt / [ (b - a) sqrt(t(1 - t)) ] from 0 to 1. The (b -a) terms cancel, so the integral is ∫0^1 dt/sqrt(t(1 - t)) = π.

Yes, that seems correct. So the value is π, which is approximately 3.1415926, option G.

Wait, but wait another thing. Sometimes, when you have integrals involving square roots, they can relate to arcsin or something else. Let me think of another approach for verification.

Alternative approach: Let me consider a substitution to make the integral look like the standard form for arcsin. Let's set x = a + sin^2(theta), but that might not be the best approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps trigonometric substitution. Let me set x = a + (b - a) sin^2(theta), which would make (x - a) = (b - a) sin^2(theta) and (b - x) = (b - a) cos^2(theta). Then the square root becomes sqrt( (b - a)^2 sin^2(theta) cos^2(theta) ) = (b - a) sin(theta) cos(theta).

So the integral becomes dx / [ (b - a) sin(theta) cos(theta) ].

But dx = 2 (b - a) sin(theta) cos(theta) d(theta), because dx/d(theta) = 2 (b - a) sin(theta) cos(theta).

So substituting, the integral becomes [2 (b -a) sin(theta) cos(theta) d(theta) ] / [ (b - a) sin(theta) cos(theta) ) ].

The (b -a) and sin(theta) cos(theta) terms cancel out, leaving 2 d(theta).

Integrate from when x = a to x = b. When x = a, sin^2(theta) = 0, so theta = 0. When x = b, sin^2(theta) = 1, so theta = pi/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ from 0 to pi/2 of 2 d(theta) = 2 * (pi/2 - 0) )= pi.

Same result. So the integral equals pi, which is approximately 3.1415926. So the correct answer is G.

The integral to solve is:

\[
\int_a^b \frac{dx}{\sqrt{(x-a)(b-x)}}
\]

To evaluate this, we use the substitution \( t = \frac{x-a}{b-a} \), which simplifies the integral. When \( x = a \), \( t = 0 \), and when \( x = b \), \( t = 1 \). Rewriting \( x \) in terms of \( t \), we have:

\[
x = a + (b-a)t \quad \text{and} \quad dx = (b-a)dt
\]

Substituting into the integral, the denominator becomes:

\[
\sqrt{(x-a)(b-x)} = \sqrt{(b-a)^2 t(1-t)} = (b-a)\sqrt{t(1-t)}
\]

Thus, the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_0^1 \frac{(b-a)dt}{(b-a)\sqrt{t(1-t)}} = \int_0^1 \frac{dt}{\sqrt{t(1-t)}}
\]

This is a standard integral related to the Beta function \( B(p, q) \), where \( p = q = \frac{1}{2} \). The Beta function is defined as:

\[
B(p, q) = \int_0^1 t^{p-1}(1-t)^{q-1}dt
\]

For \( p = q = \frac{1}{2} \), the integral becomes:

\[
B\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right) = \int_0^1 t^{-1/2}(1-t)^{-1/2}dt = \pi
\]

Thus, the value of the original integral is \( \pi \), which is approximately \( 3.1415926 \). Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**G: 3.1415926**
