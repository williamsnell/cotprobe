Okay, so I've got this problem here about a factory producing two types of automobile suspension struts, type I and type Y. I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let's read the question again carefully. The factory can produce 699 units of type I per hour with a new machine, at $1.20 each. Type Y takes the same machine but only 30 per hour, costing $1.30 each. Each production day is 24 hours, and they have a budget of $4,005. The goal is to produce as many type Y as possible, but they have a quota of 2,700 type I per day. So the questions are: (i) how many Y struts are produced daily, and (ii) is the budget enough?

Hmm. Okay, so I think I need to set up some equations here. Let's define variables. Let's say x is the number of hours spent producing type I, and y is the hours for type Y. Since the factory runs 24 hours a day, x + y must equal 24, right?

So equation one: x + y = 24.

Now, for production. Each hour produces 699 type I units, so total type I is 699x. They have a quota of 2,700 type I per day, so 699x must be >= 2,700. Let me calculate that. 699x = 2700 → x = 2700 / 699. Let me compute that. 699 times 3 is 2097, 699*4 is 2796. Oh wait, 2700 is between 3 and 4 times 699. So 2700 divided by 699 is approximately 3.86 hours. Wait, but you can't have a fraction of an hour in this context, right? Or do they allow it? Hmm, the problem might assume fractional hours since it's a math problem, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed as if x can be a decimal for now.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of units per day. Let me think again. The factory's quota is 2700 type I struts per day. Since each hour produces 699, how many hours do they need to spend on type I to meet the quota?

So hours needed for type I: 2700 / 699 = let me calculate that. 699 × 3 = 2097, 699 × 3.857 ≈ 2700. So approximately 3.857 hours, which is about 3 hours and 51 minutes. But since the factory runs 24 hours a day, the remaining time can be used for type Y. So y = 24 - x.

So after calculating x, we can find y, and then multiply by 30 (since each hour makes 30 type Y struts) to get the number of type Y produced.

But wait, I also need to consider the budget. The total cost for type I and type Y should not exceed $4,005. So the cost equation would be: (1.20 * 699x) + (1.30 * 30y) <= 4005.

Wait, no, because x is in hours, so the number of type I units is 699x, each costing $1.20. Similarly, type Y units would be 30y, each costing $1.30. So the total cost is 1.20*(699x) + 1.30*(30y) ≤ 4005.

But since x + y = 24, I can substitute y = 24 - x into the cost equation.

So let's set up the equations.

First, from the quota:

699x ≥ 2700 → x ≥ 2700 / 699 ≈ 3.857 hours.

So x must be at least approximately 3.857 hours. Since the factory wants to maximize type Y, they'll spend the minimum hours on type I, and the rest on Y.

So let's take x = 2700 / 699 exactly. Then y = 24 - x.

But wait, maybe it's better to compute x as exactly 2700/699, which is 3.857 approx.

So y = 24 - (2700/699) = (24*699 - 2700)/699 → let's compute numerator: 24*699 = 16776, minus 2700 is 14076. So y = 14076 / 699 = let's compute that.

14076 divided by 699. Let's see: 699 ×20=13,980. So 14076-13980=96. So 20 + 96/699 → 20.137 hours approx.

So y ≈20.137 hours.

Then, the number of type Y struts produced is 30*y = 30 *20.137 ≈ 604.11, which is about 604. But since you can't produce a fraction of a strut, maybe they round down to 604? But the options don't have 604. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, I see options like 585, 550, 560, 585, 700, etc. So 604 isn't one of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of exact values without approximations. Let's compute x more precisely.

x = 2700 / 699 = 3.857142857 hours (approximately).

So y = 24 - 3.857142857 = 20.14285714 hours.

Number of type Y struts = 30 * y = 30 * 20.14285714 = 604.2857142, which is about 604.2857. So approximately 604 type Y struts.

But none of the options match 604. Hmm. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the budget part. Because even if we meet the quota, we have to make sure that the total cost doesn't exceed $4,005.

So let's compute the cost when x is exactly 2700/699 hours.

So cost for type I: 1.20 * 699x = 1.20 * 2700 = $3,240.

Because 699x = 2700, so 1.20 *2700=3240.

Then, time left for Y is y = 24 - x = 24 - (2700/699) = (24*699 -2700)/699 = (16776 -2700)/699 =14076/699=20.142857 hours.

So the number of Y struts is 30 *20.142857 ≈ 604.2857, as before.

Now, the cost for Y would be 1.30 per unit, so 1.30 *604.2857 ≈ 604.2857 *1.3.

Let me compute that: 600*1.3=780, 4.2857*1.3≈5.571. So total Y cost is about 785.57 dollars.

So total cost is 3240 + 785.57 ≈4025.57, which is over the budget of 4005. So the budget isn't sufficient in this case.

Wait, but the options have (i) and (ii). So for part (i), the number of Y struts would be 604 when the budget is exceeded. But since the options don't have 604, perhaps I should think that maybe the factory can't spend that much and has to adjust.

Alternatively, perhaps the factory uses the minimum x to meet the quota, then uses as much as possible y without exceeding the budget. So let's approach it with the budget constraint.

So the total cost must be ≤4005.

Let me set up the cost equation again:

Total cost = (1.20 *699)x + (1.30 *30)y ≤4005.

But since x + y =24, y=24 -x.

So substituting:

1.20*699 x + 1.30*30*(24 -x) ≤4005.

Compute each term:

1.20 *699 = 838.8 per hour for type I.

1.30 *30 = 39 per hour for type Y.

So equation becomes: 838.8 x + 39*(24 -x) ≤4005.

Let me compute 39*24: 936.

So equation: 838.8x + 936 -39x ≤4005.

Combine like terms: (838.8 -39)x +936 ≤4005 → 799.8x +936 ≤4005.

Subtract 936 from both sides: 799.8x ≤ 3069.

So x ≤3069 /799.8 → Let's compute that.

3069 ÷ 800 is approx 3.84 (since 800*3.84=3072, which is a bit over). But since it's 799.8, let's compute exact:

3069 / 799.8 = Let me compute 799.8 ×3.84 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 3069 /799.8.

Dividing 3069 by 799.8:

799.8 ×3=2399.4

3069-2399.4=669.6

Now, 799.8 ×0.8=639.84

669.6 -639.84=29.76

Now, 799.8 ×0.037= approx 29.6 (since 0.037*800=29.6).

So total is approx 3.8 +0.037=3.837 hours.

So x ≤3.837 hours.

Wait, but earlier we had x must be ≥3.857 hours to meet the quota of 2700 type I. But 3.837 is less than 3.857, so that's a problem. Because if x can't be both ≥3.857 and ≤3.837, which is impossible, then the budget isn't sufficient to meet the quota and maximize Y production.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cost equation.

Wait, let's re-express:

Total cost is 1.20 * (699x) + 1.30*(30y) ≤4005.

But y =24 -x.

So substituting:

1.20*699 x +1.30*30*(24 -x) ≤4005.

Compute each part:

1.20 *699 = 838.8 → correct.

1.30 *30 =39 → correct.

So equation: 838.8x +39*(24 -x) ≤4005.

Compute 39*(24 -x) = 936 -39x → correct.

So equation becomes 838.8x +936 -39x ≤4005 → 838.8x -39x +936 ≤4005.

Which is (838.8 -39)x +936 ≤4005 → 799.8x +936 ≤4005.

Subtract 936: 799.8x ≤4005 -936=3069 → correct.

So x ≤3069 /799.8 ≈3.837 hours.

But from the quota, x must be ≥3.857 hours. So 3.837 <3.857 → which is impossible. Therefore, the budget isn't sufficient to meet the quota if we try to spend the minimal time on type I and the rest on type Y.

Wait, that can't be right because the options have some where budget is sufficient. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the factory can't meet the quota within the budget, so they have to adjust. Or maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the factory must meet the quota of 2700 type I, regardless of the budget. So the budget might be exceeded, but the production is done as per the quota, and then check if the budget is sufficient.

In that case, the number of Y struts would be as calculated before, 604, but the total cost would be over the budget, so the budget isn't sufficient. But looking at the options, none have 604. So perhaps I should re-examine.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming x must be exactly 2700/699. Let me think differently.

Let me define the number of type I struts as exactly 2700, which requires x =2700/699 =3.857 hours.

Then, the cost for type I is 1.20 *2700 =3240.

The remaining hours for Y would be 24 -3.857 ≈20.143 hours.

So Y struts produced:30 *20.143≈604.2857, as before.

The cost for Y would be 604.2857 *1.30 ≈604.2857 *1.3.

Let me compute 600 *1.3 =780, 4.2857*1.3≈5.571, so total ≈785.571.

Total cost: 3240 +785.571≈4025.57, which is more than 4005, so the budget is insufficient.

So for part (i), the number of Y struts is approximately 604, and part (ii) the budget isn't sufficient.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:585 Y, No. But wait, 585 is less than 604, so perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the factory can't produce 604 Y struts because it would exceed the budget, so they have to reduce Y production to fit within the budget while still meeting the quota.

Wait, that makes sense. So perhaps, after meeting the quota for I, the remaining budget is used for Y.

So the approach would be:

1. Calculate the cost to produce 2700 type I: 2700 *1.20 =3240.

2. Subtract this from the total budget:4005 -3240=765.

3. Now, the remaining money can be used for type Y. Each Y strut costs $1.30, so the maximum number of Y struts is 765 /1.30 = let's compute that.

765 ÷1.3 → 1.3 ×588=765.6 → so 588 units, but wait, 765 /1.3=588.46, so approximately 588 units.

But wait, each hour produces 30 Y struts, so the time needed is 588.46 /30 ≈19.615 hours.

But the available time after producing type I is 24 -3.857≈20.143 hours. So 19.615 hours is less than the available 20.143, so it's feasible.

So the number of Y struts would be 588. But wait, the options don't have 588. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the remaining budget. Let me compute 4005 -3240=765.

Then, 765 /1.30=588.46, which is 588 units. So 588 Y struts.

But looking at the options, the closest is I think option I:600 type Y, Yes. Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the approach is incorrect. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the factory uses the budget to determine how much can be spent on Y after meeting the quota.

So, total budget is 4005. The cost for type I is fixed at 3240, leaving 765 for Y.

Each Y strut costs 1.30, so max Y units=765 /1.30=588.46, so 588 units. Since each hour produces 30 units, time needed is 588 /30=19.6 hours.

Which is within the remaining 20.143 hours, so possible. So Y production is 588 units.

But the options don't have 588. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate how many Y struts can be produced within the remaining budget and time.

Let me set up the equations again.

We have to produce at least 2700 type I, which takes x=3.857 hours.

The remaining time is y=24 -x=20.143 hours.

The cost for type I is 3240, so the remaining budget is 765.

We can produce Y struts as long as 1.30*n ≤765, where n is the number of Y struts. So n=765/1.30≈588.46→588.

But since each hour produces 30, time needed is 588/30=19.6 hours, which is within the available 20.143, so possible.

So Y production is 588 units, but none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I should approach this problem using linear equations with the constraints.

Let me define the variables as:

Let x = number of hours producing type I.

y = number of hours producing type Y.

Constraints:

1. x + y ≤24 (but since we want to maximize Y, we'll use all 24 hours).

2. 699x ≥2700 → x ≥2700/699≈3.857.

3. Cost:1.20*699x +1.30*30y ≤4005.

We need to maximize Y, which is 30y.

So substituting y=24 -x into the cost constraint:

1.20*699x +1.30*30*(24 -x) ≤4005.

As before, this gives 838.8x + 39*(24 -x) ≤4005.

Which simplifies to 799.8x +936 ≤4005 → 799.8x ≤3069 → x ≤3.837.

But we must have x ≥3.857, which is impossible. Therefore, it's impossible to meet the quota and stay within the budget if we try to maximize Y. So the factory must either reduce Y production or exceed the budget.

But the question says the factory wants to produce as many Y as possible, but has a quota of 2700 type I. So perhaps they have to meet the quota even if it exceeds the budget. So they'll spend the minimal x on I, which is ~3.857 hours, and the rest on Y, which is 20.143 hours, producing 604 Y struts, but the cost would be over by $4025.57, so the budget is insufficient.

Looking at the options, none have 604, but option E is 585 Y, Yes. Option I is 600 Y, Yes. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recompute the cost when x is exactly 3.857.

So x=3.857 hours.

Type I cost:1.20 *699 *3.857 → 699*3.857 ≈2700, so 1.20*2700=3240.

Type Y time:24 -3.857=20.143 hours.

Type Y units:30 *20.143=604.2857.

Cost for Y:604.2857 *1.30=604.2857*1.3.
