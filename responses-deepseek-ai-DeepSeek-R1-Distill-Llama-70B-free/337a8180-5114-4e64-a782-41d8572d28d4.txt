Question:

If a living frog muscle is dissected out from a frog's body and placed in a closed container without oxygen, it can contract for a time when stimulated. Then it stops. But if the container is opened, it soon regains the ability to contract. Comment.

Options:

A: The muscle cells contract due to the presence of carbon dioxide.
B: The muscle contracts because of the decrease in temperature when the container is opened.
C: The muscle cells are reanimated by the light entering the container when it is opened.
D: The muscle cells contract due to the release of lactic acid in the absence of oxygen.
E: The muscle cells require the presence of an inert gas, such as argon, to contract.
F: The muscle cells need nitrogen to contract.
G: The muscle cells contract due to the introduction of water.
H: The presence of oxygen enables the muscle cells to undergo aerobic respiration and produce more ATP, regaining its ability to contract.
I: Muscle contraction is restored due to increased humidity within the container.
J: The muscle cells contract because of the introduction of a new energy source when the container is opened.

Okay, so I have this biology question here about frog muscles and their ability to contract under certain conditions. Hmm, let's try to think through this step by step. 

The question says that a living frog muscle is dissected and placed in a closed container without oxygen. It can contract for some time when stimulated but then stops. But when the container is opened, it regains the ability to contract. I need to figure out why that happens.

First, I remember that muscles need energy to contract. The energy comes from ATP. So when the muscle is in a closed container without oxygen, it's probably relying on anaerobic respiration because there's no O2 for aerobic respiration. Anaerobic respiration in muscles typically produces lactic acid, right? 

Wait, but how long does anaerobic respiration last? I think it's a limited supply because it doesn't generate as much ATP as aerobic. So the muscle would use up its glycogen stores, produce some ATP until the byproducts accumulate, like lactic acid, which might cause fatigue or the muscle to stop contracting.

But then, when the container is opened, oxygen becomes available again. So maybe now the muscle cells can switch back to aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is more efficient, producing more ATP. So with more ATP available, the muscle can contract again. 

Let me look at the options. Option H says the presence of oxygen allows aerobic respiration, producing more ATP. That makes sense because without O2, the muscle would fatigue quickly due to limited ATP from anaerobic respiration. When O2 is reintroduced, aerobic respiration kicks in, replenishing ATP, so the muscle can function again.

Option D says it's about lactic acid in the absence of O2. Well, lactic acid builds up without O2, but that's a byproduct, not the reason the muscle stops contracting. So D isn't the right reason for the muscle stopping.

Other options: A talks about CO2, but I don't think that's directly causing contraction. B is about temperature, but opening a container wouldn't significantly change temperature quickly. C mentions light, but muscles don't need light to contract. E and F are about inert gases or nitrogenâ€”no, muscles don't require those to contract. G is about water, but the container was closed, so maybe it's humid already. I is about humidity again, perhaps, but that's not the main factor here. J mentions a new energy source when opened. Well, oxygen isn't an energy source but allows for a more efficient energy production process.

So the best answer seems to be H.

The muscle cells require energy in the form of ATP to contract. In the absence of oxygen, the muscle relies on anaerobic respiration, which is less efficient and quickly depletes energy stores, leading to the accumulation of lactic acid and muscle fatigue. When the container is opened, oxygen becomes available, allowing the muscle cells to switch to aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is more efficient, producing a greater amount of ATP and enabling the muscle to regain its ability to contract. 

The correct answer is:

H: The presence of oxygen enables the muscle cells to undergo aerobic respiration and produce more ATP, regaining its ability to contract.
