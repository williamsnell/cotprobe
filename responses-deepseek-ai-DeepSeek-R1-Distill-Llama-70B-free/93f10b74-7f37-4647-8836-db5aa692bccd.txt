Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about charges on metal spheres and the electrostatic force between them. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the setup is three identical metal spheres: A, B, and C. Their initial charges are given. Sphere A has charge Q, B has -Q/4, and C has Q/2. Oh wait, and Q is 2.00e-14 C. Then, A and B are fixed with a separation d = 1.20 meters, which is much larger than the spheres, so I guess they're point charges for calculation purposes.

The process is that sphere C is first touched to A, then to B, and then removed. After that, we need to find the magnitude of the electrostatic force between A and B.

Wait, right. When two identical metal spheres are touched, their charges redistribute equally because they're conductors. So when C touches A, they'll share their charges, and then when C touches B, they'll do the same again.

Let me outline the steps.

First, initial charges:
A: Q
B: -Q/4
C: Q/2

Step 1: C touches A. Both are identical, so their charges will average out. So total charge on A and C together is Q + Q/2 = (3Q/2). Since they're identical, each will get half of that. So each (A and C) will have (3Q/2) / 2 = 3Q/4.

Wait, wait. Oh no, wait. Let me think. Each sphere will end up with the same charge because they're identical. So when you touch two spheres, the total charge is split equally.

So initial charges before touching: A has Q, C has Q/2.

Total charge is Q + Q/2 = 3Q/2. Divided by 2 gives each sphere 3Q/4.

So after touching A and C, both A and C now have charge 3Q/4 each.

Then step 2: C is touched to B. So now, C has 3Q/4, and B has -Q/4.

Again, when C touches B, their total charge is 3Q/4 + (-Q/4) = (3Q/4 - Q/4) = 2Q/4 = Q/2.

So the total is Q/2, split equally between B and C since they're identical. So each will have (Q/2)/2 = Q/4.

So after the second touch, B and C each have charge Q/4.

Now, sphere C is removed. So the charges on A and B are now:

A: 3Q/4 (from the first touch)
B: Q/4 (from the second touch)
C is taken away, so no longer in the picture.

Now, we need to find the electrostatic force between A and B.

The formula for the electrostatic force is Coulomb's law: F = k * |q1 * q2| / r².

Where k is Coulomb's constant, 8.988e9 N·m²/C². The separation r is 1.20 meters.

So first, compute the charges after all the touching. Let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

After first touch (A and C):
A: (Q + Q/2)/2 = (3Q/2)/2 = 3Q/4.
C: same as A, 3Q/4.

Then, touching C to B:
C has 3Q/4, B has -Q/4.
Total charge is 3Q/4 - Q/4 = 2Q/4 = Q/2.
So each (B and C) now has (Q/2)/2 = Q/4.

So A is 3Q/4, B is Q/4. Wait, no, wait: because after the first touch, C is 3Q/4. Then, when C touches B, B's charge changes, and C's charge changes again.

Wait, but when C touches B, both B and C will have the same charge. So yes, ending up at Q/4 each.

So A is 3Q/4, B is Q/4.

Now, the force between A and B.

But wait, the signs matter. A is positive (since Q is positive), and B is positive too because Q is positive, so Q/4 is positive.

Wait, wait. No. Let me think. The initial charge on B is -Q/4, which is negative. So when C (with 3Q/4) touches B, the sum is 3Q/4 + (-Q/4) = 2Q/4 = Q/2. So each becomes Q/4. So B becomes Q/4, which is positive because Q is positive.

So A is 3Q/4 (positive), B is Q/4 (positive). So the force between them will be repulsive, but the question only asks for the magnitude.

So the product of the charges is (3Q/4) * (Q/4) = 3 Q² / 16.

Wait, but wait: No, wait, the charges after the process are A: 3Q/4, B: Q/4.

So F = k * ( (3Q/4) * (Q/4) ) / d².

Wait, but let me plug in the numbers step by step.

Given Q is 2.00e-14 C.

So 3Q/4 = 3*(2e-14)/4 = 6e-14 /4 = 1.5e-14 C.

Wait, 2e-14 *3 is 6e-14, divided by 4 is 1.5e-14 C. So A has 1.5e-14 C.

B has Q/4 = (2e-14)/4 = 0.5e-14 C.

So q1 = 1.5e-14 C, q2 = 0.5e-14 C.

So the product is (1.5e-14) * (0.5e-14) = 0.75e-28 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 N·m²/C² * 0.75e-28 C² = 8.988e9 * 0.75e-28.

Compute that: 8.988 * 0.75 = 6.741. So 6.741e-19 N·m²/C² * C² → 6.741e-19 N.

Wait, but wait, that's before dividing by r squared. Oh right, because the formula is F = k q1 q2 / r².

So I forgot the r² part. So the calculation so far is k q1 q2 = 6.741e-19 (N·m²), but we have to divide by (1.20 m)^2.

So (1.20)^2 is 1.44 m².

So F = 6.741e-19 / 1.44 ≈ let's see.

6.741e-19 / 1.44 → 6.741 / 1.44 = approximately 4.68, so 4.68e-19 N.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute more accurately.

6.741 divided by 1.44. Let's see:

1.44 * 4 = 5.76 → 6.741 -5.76= 0.981 → 0.981 / 1.44 = approx 0.68.

So 4.68 → so 4.68e-19 N.

Looking at the options, option C is 4.68e-19 N.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the charges again.

Wait, after the first touch, A and C each have 3Q/4. Then when C touches B, which is -Q/4, the sum is 3Q/4 - Q/4 = 2Q/4 = Q/2. So each becomes Q/4. So B ends up at Q/4, and C ends up at Q/4.

So the charges are A: 3Q/4, B: Q/4. Both positive.

Then, F = k*( (3Q/4) * (Q/4) ) / d².

Which is k*(3Q²/16) / d².

Plugging in Q = 2e-14 C.

So (3*(2e-14)^2)/(16 * (1.2)^2 )

Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 3Q² is 3*(2e-14)^2 = 3*4e-28 = 12e-28.

Divide by 16: 12e-28 /16 = 0.75e-28.

Multiply by k (8.988e9): 8.988e9 * 0.75e-28 = 6.741e-19.

Divide by (1.2)^2 = 1.44 gives 6.741e-19 / 1.44 ≈ 4.68e-19 N.

So the answer should be option C.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

C: 4.68 ×10−19 N.

Yes, option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the charge redistribution and apply Coulomb's law to find the electrostatic force between spheres $A$ and $B$ after sphere $C$ is touched to both and removed.

### Step 1: Initial charges
- Sphere $A$: $Q$
- Sphere $B$: $-Q/4$
- Sphere $C$: $Q/2$

Here, $Q = 2.00 \times 10^{-14} \, \mathrm{C}$.

### Step 2: Touching sphere $C$ to sphere $A$
When two identical spheres are touched, their charges redistribute equally. The total charge on $A$ and $C$ is:
\[
Q + \frac{Q}{2} = \frac{3Q}{2}.
\]
Each sphere gets half of the total:
\[
q_A = q_C = \frac{3Q}{4}.
\]

### Step 3: Touching sphere $C$ to sphere $B$
Sphere $C$ now has charge $\frac{3Q}{4}$, and sphere $B$ has charge $-\frac{Q}{4}$. The total charge on $B$ and $C$ is:
\[
\frac{3Q}{4} + \left(-\frac{Q}{4}\right) = \frac{Q}{2}.
\]
Each sphere gets half of the total:
\[
q_B = q_C = \frac{Q}{4}.
\]

### Step 4: Final charges
- Sphere $A$: $\frac{3Q}{4}$
- Sphere $B$: $\frac{Q}{4}$
- Sphere $C$ is removed, so it no longer affects the system.

### Step 5: Electrostatic force between $A$ and $B$
Using Coulomb's law:
\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_A \cdot q_B|}{r^2},
\]
where $k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2}$ and $r = 1.20 \, \mathrm{m}$.

Substitute the charges:
\[
q_A = \frac{3Q}{4}, \quad q_B = \frac{Q}{4}.
\]
The product of the charges is:
\[
q_A \cdot q_B = \frac{3Q}{4} \cdot \frac{Q}{4} = \frac{3Q^2}{16}.
\]
Substitute $Q = 2.00 \times 10^{-14} \, \mathrm{C}$:
\[
q_A \cdot q_B = \frac{3 \cdot (2.00 \times 10^{-14})^2}{16} = \frac{3 \cdot 4.00 \times 10^{-28}}{16} = 0.75 \times 10^{-28} \, \mathrm{C^2}.
\]
Now calculate the force:
\[
F = \frac{k \cdot q_A \cdot q_B}{r^2} = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (0.75 \times 10^{-28})}{(1.20)^2}.
\]
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (0.75 \times 10^{-28}) = 6.741 \times 10^{-19}.
\]
Then divide by $(1.20)^2 = 1.44$:
\[
F = \frac{6.741 \times 10^{-19}}{1.44} = 4.68 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{N}.
\]

### Final Answer
The magnitude of the electrostatic force between spheres $A$ and $B$ is **4.68 × 10⁻¹⁹ N**.

C: $4.68 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{N}$
