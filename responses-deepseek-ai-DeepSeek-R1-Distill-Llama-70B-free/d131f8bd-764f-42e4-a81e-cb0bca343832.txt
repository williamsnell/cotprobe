Question:

An 18-year-old primigravid woman comes for her initial prenatal visit at 16 weeks' gestation. She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period but says that the pregnancy probably occurred immediately after she stopped taking oral contraceptives 5 months ago. Maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentration is increased to 3 multiples of the median. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Amniocentesis for measurement of α-fetoprotein concentration
B: Immediate cesarean section
C: Hormone therapy to balance MSAFP levels
D: Monitor patient without taking action
E: Triple screening for MSAFP, serum β-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations
F: Administer a pregnancy test
G: Prescribe oral contraceptives
H: Ultrasonography
I: Repeat measurement of MSAFP concentration
J: Conduct a pelvic exam

Okay, so I have this question about a prenatal visit, and I need to figure out the next step in management. Let me try to break it down.

The patient is an 18-year-old primigravid woman, which means she's pregnant for the first time. She comes in at 16 weeks gestation, but she's unsure about her last menstrual period. She thinks the pregnancy probably happened right after she stopped taking oral contraceptives five months ago. Hmm, so she might have some uncertainty about her exact due date.

Her MSAFP (maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein) is increased to 3 multiples of the median. I remember that MSAFP is a screening test done during pregnancy to check for certain abnormalities. High levels can indicate things like neural tube defects (like spina bifida), or maybe multiple pregnancies, but it can also be due to incorrect gestational dating.

So, the question is about what to do next. The options are A through J. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Amniocentesis for AFP measurement. Well, amniocentesis is an invasive test that can measure AFP in the amniotic fluid, but it's usually done after an abnormal screening test, like MSAFP. But wait, is it the immediate next step?

Option B: Immediate cesarean section. That doesn't make sense here because it's only 16 weeks, and cesarean is for delivery, not for diagnosis.

Option C: Hormone therapy. I don't think MSAFP levels are treated with hormones. That doesn't seem right.

Option D: Monitor without action. Maybe, but since the MSAFP is high, we probably need to do something to check further.

Option E: Triple screening. The triple screen includes MSAFP, β-hCG, and estriol. But she already has an MSAFP done. Maybe this is part of the same screening, but I'm not sure if this is the next step.

Option F: Administer a pregnancy test. She's already 16 weeks pregnant, so that's unnecessary.

Option G: Prescribe oral contraceptives. She's pregnant, so that's not appropriate.

Option H: Ultrasonography. Ultrasound can confirm the gestational age and check for multiples or anomalies. Since her LMP is uncertain, ultrasound can help date the pregnancy better. Also, high MSAFP could be due to incorrect dating.

Option I: Repeat MSAFP. Maybe, but I think the first step is often an ultrasound to check dating and for possible multiples or anomalies.

Option J: Pelvic exam. Not sure how that helps with MSAFP levels.

So, putting it together. High MSAFP can be due to several factors. One of the first things to check is the gestational age because if the dates are wrong, the MSAFP levels might not be accurate. An ultrasound can confirm the gestational age and also look for signs of twins or other issues that might cause elevated AFP.

So, the most appropriate next step would be ultrasonography. That's option H.

The patient is an 18-year-old primigravid woman at 16 weeks' gestation with an uncertain last menstrual period and an elevated MSAFP level of 3 multiples of the median. Elevated MSAFP can indicate potential issues such as neural tube defects, multiple pregnancies, or incorrect gestational dating. Given her uncertainty about the date of her last menstrual period, confirming gestational age is critical. Ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step as it can confirm the gestational age, assess for multiples or anomalies, and provide clarity on the cause of the elevated MSAFP. Other options, such as amniocentesis or repeating the MSAFP, may be considered later but are not the immediate next step.
