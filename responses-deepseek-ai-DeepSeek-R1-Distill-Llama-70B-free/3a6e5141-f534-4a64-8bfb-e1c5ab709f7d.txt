Okay, so I've got this problem here about a company's employee incomes. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The company has 400 employees, and the mean income is $20,500. The standard deviation is $3,750. The distribution is normal, which means it's a bell curve. The question is asking how many employees are expected to have an income between $13,000 and $28,000.

Wait, right, normally distributed data means I can use z-scores and the 68-95-99.7 rule. Oh wait, but wait, the intervals here aren't the usual one, two, or three standard deviations. Let me think. So the mean is 20,500. Let me calculate how many standard deviations away 13,000 and 28,000 are from the mean.

So for 13,000: subtract the mean. 13,000 -20,500 = -7,500. Now divide by the standard deviation, which is 3,750. So -7500 /3750 = -2. So that's two standard deviations below the mean.

Similarly, 28,000 -20,500 = 7,500. Divide by 3750, that's 2. So two standard deviations above the mean.

Oh, right! The 95% rule says that about 95% of data lies within two standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution. So that would be from -2 to +2 standard deviations.

So that's 95% of the employees. There are 400 employees, so 0.95 *400 = 380. Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations. 95% of 400 is 0.95 *400 = 380. But looking at the options, none of them have 380. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe it's 95% within two standard deviations, but that includes both sides. So the area between -2 and +2 is about 95%, so 95% of 400 is 380. But I don't see 380 as an option. The options are A:100, B:200, C:390, D:300, E:400, F:385, G:375, H:395, I:350, J:50.

So the closest option would be F:385 or G:375. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should calculate it more precisely using the z-table instead of relying on the 95% approximation.

The z-score for 13k is -2, and for 28k it's +2. So the area between them is the total area under the curve from -2 to +2. Let's see, the standard normal distribution table gives the cumulative probability up to a certain z-score. So for z=2, the area to the left is 0.9772, and for z=-2, it's 0.0228. So the area between them is 0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544, which is 95.44%.

So 95.44% of 400 employees. Let me compute that: 0.9544 *400 = 381.76. But again, the options don't have 382. Wait, but maybe the question expects an exact number, but perhaps rounding is involved. The closest option is F:385 or G:375. Hmm, but 381.76 is closer to 380, which isn't an option. But wait, looking at the options, F is 385 and G is 375. Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is slightly different. Let me think. Oh wait, another approach: the number of people between 13k and 28k is the same as the number within two standard deviations of the mean, which is about 95.44% of 400. So 0.9544 *400 = 381.76, which is approximately 382. But the options don't have that. Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is 380, but it's not an option. Wait, looking again, the options are: G is 375, F is 385. Hmm, maybe the question expects 380 but it's not present, so perhaps I made a mistake in the range.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the initial calculation. The lower bound is 13k, which is 20,500-3,750*2 = 20,500-7,500=13,000. Upper is 20,500+7,500=28,000. So the range is exactly two standard deviations from the mean on both sides. So within that range, it's 95.44% as per z-scores.

So 95.44% of 400 is 381.76, which is approximately 382. But none of the options are 382. The closest is F:385 (which is 5 more) or G:375 (which is 7 less). Hmm. But wait, perhaps the options are rounded differently. Let me think again: 95.44% is approximately 95%, so 95% of 400 is 380. But 380 isn't an option either. Wait, the options don't have 380. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, maybe the question is in terms of individual data points, not area. Or perhaps I should calculate using the exact z-scores. But I think the approach is correct. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, option F is 385, which is 96.25% (because 385 is 96.25% of 400). Hmm, 96.25% would correspond to a z-score a bit higher than 2. Let me see, what z-score gives 0.96 of the area? Let's think about the z-table. For z=2, cumulative is 0.9772, so the area within is 0.9544. For a higher z, say z=2.1, the cumulative is about 0.9821. So the area between -2.1 and +2.1 would be 0.9821 - (1 - 0.9821) = 0.9642, which is about 96.42%. So 0.9642 *400 is around 385.7, which would be approximately 386. But the option is 385, which is F.

Wait, but in the question, the range is exactly two standard deviations, so the exact area is 95.44%, which is approximately 381.76. So perhaps the intended answer is 380, but since that's not present, maybe the closest is F:385. But then, wait, option F is 385, which is 96.25%, which would correspond to a z-score slightly higher than 2. So perhaps the question expects using the approximate 95% and rounding up, leading to 380, but since that's not an option, maybe it's expecting 375 or 385.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me go through it again.

Mean = 20,500. Standard deviation =3,750.

Lower bound: 13,000. So z1 = (13,000 -20,500)/3750 = (-7500)/3750 = -2.

Upper bound:28,000. z2= (28,000-20,500)/3750 =7500/3750=2.

The area between z=-2 and z=2 is the probability that a randomly selected employee's income falls within this range.

Using the standard normal table, the cumulative probability up to z=2 is 0.9772, and up to z=-2 is 0.0228. So the area between is 0.9772 -0.0228 = 0.9544.

So 0.9544 * 400 employees = 381.76, approximately 382.

Looking back at the options, none of them have 382. The closest is F:385 and G:375. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the options have a typo, but assuming they don't, perhaps the intended answer is 380, but since it's not there, perhaps the correct approach is to pick the closest, which would be G:375? Or maybe I should think of it as 95%, which would be 380, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to consider that 95% is approximately 380, but since it's not available, perhaps the intended choice is F:385 because it's the closest higher option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is using the empirical rule, which says that 95% is within two SDs, but perhaps the options are rounded to the nearest 5. So 380 would round to 375 or 385. Wait, 380 is exactly between 375 and 385. Hmm, but typically, 380 would round up to 385. Because 380 is 5 more than 375, and 5 less than 385. So if rounding to the nearest 5, it would be 380 to 380, but in the options, it's not present. So perhaps the intended answer is 385, which is option F.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed to approximate 95% as 385, which is 96.25%, but that's a bit of a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the question used a different z-value, like 1.96 instead of 2, which would give a slightly higher area. Let me check: the z-score for 95% confidence is approximately 1.96, not 2. So using 1.96 might give a slightly higher value.

Wait, let's compute the area using z=1.96. The cumulative for z=1.96 is about 0.975. So the area between -1.96 and +1.96 would be 0.975 - (1 -0.975) )= 0.95 exactly. So 0.95 *400=380. Again, 380, but it's not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the precise z-scores for the exact values. Let me think. Wait, perhaps the question is expecting to use the continuity correction, but no, because the data is continuous. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the answer intended is 380, but since it's not present, perhaps the intended option is F:385. Alternatively, the options might be incorrect. But given the options, perhaps the closest is F:385. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check using the z-scores again. Let me get the exact values. For z=2, the cumulative is 0.97725, and for z=-2, it's 0.02275. So the difference is 0.9545. 0.9545 *400= 381.8, which is approximately 382. So none of the options match exactly. So perhaps the intended answer is 380, but it's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to say between $14,000 and $27,000, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the standard deviation is 3,750, which is correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should calculate the probability using the z-scores and see if it's 95.44%, which is approximately 95% of 400=380. But since 380 isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is F:385, as it's the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to choose 390, which is option C, but that would imply a higher probability, like 97.5%, which would correspond to a z of 1.96, but that's not the case here.

Wait, no, 390 would be 97.5% of 400. Because 0.975*400=390. So that would be if the z-scores were at +/-1.96, but in our case, the z-scores are +/-2, which gives 95.44%. So that's not matching.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here because the correct number is approximately 382, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I should re-examine the options again.

Looking at the options, F is 385, G is 375. Let me see, 0.9544 is 95.44%, which is about 95.4%. So 95% of 400 is 380, which is not present. The next possible is G:375, which is 93.75% (because 375/400=0.9375). Alternatively, F:385 is 96.25% (0.9625). So which is closer to 95.44%? 96.25 is 0.96, which is a bit higher than 0.9544. So 385 is 0.96, which is 0.96-0.9544=0.0056 higher. 375 is 0.9375, which is 0.017 lower. So 385 is closer. So perhaps the intended answer is F:385.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects to use the 95% as 380, but since it's not an option, maybe the closest is F:385. Therefore, I think the correct option is F:385.

To determine how many of the 400 employees are expected to have an income between $13,000 and $28,000, we use the fact that the distribution of incomes is normally distributed with a mean of $20,500 and a standard deviation of $3,750. 

1. **Calculate the z-scores** for the given bounds:
   - For $13,000:  
     \[
     z_1 = \frac{13,000 - 20,500}{3,750} = \frac{-7,500}{3,750} = -2
     \]
   - For $28,000:  
     \[
     z_2 = \frac{28,000 - 20,500}{3,750} = \frac{7,500}{3,750} = 2
     \]

2. **Determine the area under the standard normal curve** between \( z = -2 \) and \( z = 2 \). Using the standard normal distribution table:
   - The cumulative probability up to \( z = 2 \) is approximately 0.9772.
   - The cumulative probability up to \( z = -2 \) is approximately 0.0228.
   - The area between \( z = -2 \) and \( z = 2 \) is:  
     \[
     0.9772 - 0.0228 = 0.9544
     \]

3. **Calculate the expected number of employees** within this range:
   - Multiply the area (0.9544) by the total number of employees (400):  
     \[
     0.9544 \times 400 = 381.76 \approx 382
     \]

4. **Compare the result to the provided options**. The closest option to 382 is **F: 385**. While 382 is not an exact match, 385 is the nearest available option and aligns with the approximation of 95.44% of the employees falling within this range.

Thus, the best answer is **F: 385**.
