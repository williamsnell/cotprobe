Okay, so I need to figure out the key characteristics of transactional leaders. Hmm, I remember that leadership styles are a big topic in management and psychology. Let me think about what I learned before.

I think transactional leadership is one of the styles identified by Burns and later expanded by Bass. It's contrasted with transformational leadership. Right, transactional is more about exchanges between the leader and the followers.

So, transactional leaders probably focus on clear structures and tasks. They might use rewards and punishments to motivate their team members. I remember something about contingency rewards, where you do something and get a reward. So maybe that's a part of it.

What are the key characteristics? I think they give clear guidance, set specific goals, and make sure everyone knows what's expected. They might also be more directive, like telling people what to do rather than inspiring them. So perhaps they command or direct their followers.

Looking at the options, each one is a combination of three verbs. Let me go through them.

Option A: Guiding, demonstrating, motivating. Guiding sounds right, demonstrating maybe, but motivating could be part of it, but I'm not sure if demonstrating is a key part.

Option B: Guiding, commanding, motivating. That sounds plausible. Guiding fits because they set clear directions. Commanding would be directing, which makes sense. Motivating through rewards, so that fits.

Option C: Demonstrating, mentoring, guiding. Mentoring is more about development, which I think is more transformational. Transactional is less about personal growth.

Option D: Guiding, mentoring, motivating. Again, mentoring seems off for transactional.

Option E: Mentoring, demonstrating, commanding. Mentoring again doesn't fit.

Option F: Demonstrating, commanding, guiding. So demonstrating might be showing how things are done. Commanding is directing. Guiding is setting direction. Hmm, possible.

Option G: Guiding, commanding, demonstrating. Similar to F but order changed.

Option H: Commanding, mentoring, motivating. Mentoring again, probably not.

Option I: Commanding, demonstrating, motivating. Commanding and demonstrating, but does transactional include demonstrating?

Option J: Guiding, mentoring, demonstrating. Mentoring again, so no.

Wait, what are the main components of transactional leadership? I think it's about setting clear goals, providing the necessary resources, and offering rewards for meeting objectives. So the leader gives guidance on what needs to be done, commands or directs the actions, and motivates through rewards.

So the key characteristics would be guiding, commanding, and motivating. Which would correspond to option B. But wait, let me double-check.

Another thought: transactional leaders use a "tell" style, where they clearly instruct their team. They establish clear expectations and exchange rewards for performance. So guiding (as in providing direction), commanding (as in telling), and motivating (through rewards) fit.

Alternatively, demonstrating might be part of transformational leadership, where the leader inspires by example. So demonstrating might not be a key part of transactional.

So, looking back, option B says guiding, commanding, motivating. That sounds right.

The key characteristics of transactional leaders are rooted in their focus on clear structures, task-oriented direction, and the use of rewards and penalties to motivate followers. They provide clear guidance, set specific goals, and often adopt a directive approach, telling their team what to do. This aligns with the verbs "guiding," "commanding," and "motivating." 

Analyzing the options, "guiding" fits as they provide direction, "commanding" reflects their directive nature, and "motivating" captures their use of rewards. Other options either include verbs like "mentoring" or "demonstrating," which are more characteristic of transformational leadership. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: Guiding, commanding and motivating

Answer: B
