Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about behaviorist views and their criticism by ethologists. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question states that ethologists argued behaviorists ignored innate, built-in biases in learning due to evolution. So that's one point. But the question is about what else they disagreed with. The options are A through I.

I remember that behaviorists, like Skinner, focused a lot on environmental factors and learning through conditioning. They believed that behavior is primarily shaped by external stimuli and reinforcement. On the other hand, ethologists, such as Lorenz or Tinbergen, emphasized the role of instinct and innate behaviors, which are influenced by evolution.

So the question is asking what else the ethologists disagreed with besides ignoring innate biases. Let me go through the options.

Option A: Focus on negative reinforcement. Behaviorists do use reinforcement, both positive and negative, in operant conditioning. But I'm not sure if this is specifically what ethologists criticized. Maybe, but I need to check other options.

Option B: Emphasis on observation over experimentation. Wait, I think behaviorists were big on controlled experiments, like Skinner's box. Ethologists, however, do a lot of observational studies in natural settings. So maybe ethologists would disagree with behaviorists' focus on experimentation rather than observation. Hmm, but the question is about what the ethologists disagreed with. So if behaviorists focused on experimentation, ethologists might argue that observation is better, so they would disagree with the emphasis on experimentation over observation. Wait, but the option says emphasis on observation over experimentation. So if the behaviorists focused on experimentation, then the ethologists would disagree with that approach, meaning they would argue that observation is better. So the option is about behaviorists emphasizing observation, which I don't think they did. Behaviorists were more into experiments. So maybe this isn't the right answer.

Option C: Use of the trial-and-error system. Trial and error is more associated with Thorndike's law of effect, which is part of behaviorist theory. Ethologists might argue that this ignores innate tendencies, but perhaps they also disagree with the trial-and-error approach. Not sure yet.

Option D: Application of cognitive theory. No, behaviorists were against cognitive theories. They focused on observable behavior, not internal mental states. So ethologists, who might be more open to cognitive aspects (like thinking in animals), would disagree with behaviorists' disregard for cognitive theory. So this could be a point of contention.

Option E: Disregard for individual differences. Behaviorists might focus on general principles, but I'm not certain if ethologists specifically criticized them for ignoring individual differences. Maybe, but not the main issue.

Option F: Use of operant conditioning. Behaviorists definitely used operant conditioning. Ethologists might disagree with this approach because it's focused on learning and environment, not innate behaviors. So this could be a point of disagreement.

Option G: Use of animals in lab experiments. Behaviorists like Skinner used animals in controlled settings. Ethologists, who study animals in their natural habitats, might disagree with this approach. So this is a possibility.

Option H: Use of classical conditioning. Classical conditioning is Pavlov's work. Behaviorists would include this in their theories. Ethologists might not agree with the principles of conditioning as the main driver of behavior, instead emphasizing innate behaviors. So this could be another point of disagreement.

Option I: Use of humans in lab experiments. I don't think this is the main issue. Behaviorists did some human studies, but ethologists focus on animals more, so maybe this isn't the key point.

Putting it all together, the question is about what else ethologists disagreed with besides ignoring innate biases. Behaviorists focused on learning via conditioning (both operant and classical) and lab experiments, often with animals.

So let's think: Ethologists would argue that behavior isn't just about conditioning; innate behaviors matter. So they would disagree with behaviorists' reliance on conditioning principles, like operant conditioning (option F) and classical (option H). Also, behaviorists' use of lab animals (option G) would be a point of contention because ethologists prefer naturalistic observation.

Wait, the question says ethologists argued that behaviorists ignored innate biases but also disagreed with something else. So the other point is likely about the methods or the principles.

Looking back, the question is about what the ethologists disagreed with besides ignoring innate learning biases. So maybe the issue is about the methodsâ€”like using lab experiments with animals. So option G says "use of animals in laboratory experiments." Alternatively, option B is about observation vs experimentation.

Wait, behaviorists are known for their experimental approach, often in labs with animals. Ethologists, on the other hand, do more observational, naturalistic studies. So ethologists would disagree with the behaviorists' approach of using animals in lab experiments, right? Because ethologists prefer studying animals in their natural environments.

So, which option is that? Option G: the use of animals in laboratory experiments. So the ethologists would disagree with that.

Alternatively, another angle: Behaviorists dismissed the role of evolution and innate behaviors, which ethologists stressed. So the other point is the behaviorists' focus on learning and conditioning, which ignores instinct. So perhaps the other point is the use of operant conditioning (option F) or classical (option H). But the question is about what the ethologists disagreed with, so perhaps both the ignoring of innate behaviors and the use of conditioning principles.

Wait, the options are about what the ethologists argued against. So the first point is about ignoring innate biases, the second is another point.

So, after the first point, the question is what else did ethologists disagree with.

Option B is about emphasis on observation over experimentation. Behaviorists did experiments, so if ethologists emphasized observation, they would disagree with behaviorists' approach. So the behaviorist approach is experimentation, so ethologists would argue against that, meaning they would prefer observation.

So the second point of disagreement is the behaviorists' emphasis on experimentation rather than observation. So the option would be B: emphasis on observation over experimentation. Wait, no, the option says "emphasis on observation over experimentation." So if behaviorists emphasized experimentation, then ethologists would disagree with that approach, meaning ethologists would prefer observation. So the behaviorists' approach is the opposite of option B. So the correct option would be that the ethologists disagreed with the behaviorists' emphasis on experimentation, which is not exactly an option. Alternatively, the option is B, which says emphasis on observation over experimentation. Wait, if behaviorists focused on experimentation, then ethologists would emphasize observation, so they would disagree with the behaviorists' approach, which is the opposite. Therefore, the option that reflects what ethologists disagreed with is the behaviorists' emphasis on experimentation, but the option is about observation. So perhaps option B is not correct.

Alternatively, considering that behaviorists used operant conditioning (option F), which ethologists would disagree with because it focuses on learning and environment, ignoring innate factors.

Wait, but the first point is about ignoring innate biases in learning. So the second point is another aspect, perhaps the methods used. So the use of animals in lab experiments (option G) would be a methodological disagreement.

So putting it all together, the ethologists would argue against both ignoring innate behaviors and the use of lab animals in experiments. So the correct answer is G: the use of animals in laboratory experiments.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B, but I'm not as confident. I'm a bit torn between options B, G, and F.

Another approach: What are the main criticisms ethologists have of behaviorists?

Ethologists argue that behavior is influenced by evolution and genetics, which behaviorists overlooked. They also focus on studying animals in natural environments, whereas behaviorists often conduct controlled lab experiments, often with animals like pigeons and rats.

So the second point of disagreement is the behaviorists' reliance on laboratory experiments with animals. So option G is about using animals in lab experiments, which ethologists would disagree with because they prefer naturalistic observation.

So the correct answer would be G.

Behaviorist views have been criticized by ethologists for ignoring innate, built-in biases in learning due to evolution. Ethologists emphasize the role of instinct and naturalistic observation, while behaviorists focus on environmental factors and controlled laboratory experiments. Among the options provided, the key point of disagreement beyond ignoring innate biases is the behaviorists' reliance on laboratory experiments with animals. Ethologists prefer studying animals in their natural habitats, which aligns with their emphasis on observational methods over controlled lab settings. 

Option G, "the use of animals in laboratory experiments," reflects this disagreement, as ethologists would criticize behaviorists for their reliance on such methods. This makes G the most appropriate answer.

Answer: G
