Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Perestroika [Restructuring] is an urgent necessity arising from the profound processes of development in our socialist society. This society is ripe for change. It has long been yearning for it. Any delay in beginning perestroika could have led to an exacerbated internal situation in the near future, which, to put it bluntly, would have been fraught with serious social, economic, and political crises.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about Gorbachev's Perestroika. Let me start by reading the passage carefully. 

The passage is from Gorbachev's book "Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and the World," published in 1987. The key points I notice are that he says perestroika (restructuring) is an urgent necessity because of the deep development processes in socialist society. He mentions that the society is ripe for change and has been yearning for it for a long time. Then he warns that any delay in starting perestroika could lead to an exacerbated internal situation, which might result in serious social, economic, and political crises.

So the question is asking what inference we can draw from this passage. The options are from A to J, each suggesting a different argument Gorbachev made.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Restructuring wasn't urgent. But the passage says it's an urgent necessity, so A is incorrect.

Option B: Restructuring was forced by external factors. The passage talks about internal processes and society's yearning, not external factors. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Restructuring would worsen the situation. The passage actually says that delaying it would worsen things, implying that restructuring would prevent that. So C is the opposite of what's intended, so it's incorrect.

Option D: No significant impact. The passage suggests that without restructuring, there would be crises, so restructuring is significant. D is wrong.

Option E: Necessary to avoid the collapse of the Soviet Union. The passage doesn't explicitly mention collapse, but it does talk about avoiding crises. While E could be a possible inference, I need to check other options.

Option F: Primarily to appease the masses. The passage mentions society yearning for change, but the main argument is about necessity and avoiding crises, not just appeasement. So F might not be the best choice.

Option G: Lead to collapse of the political system. That's not what the passage says. It warns of crises if restructuring is delayed, not that restructuring itself would cause collapse. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Necessary to avoid a crisis. This fits because the passage says that without restructuring, there would be serious crises. So H seems correct.

Option I: Restructuring was inevitable. The passage says it's an urgent necessity and that society is ripe, implying inevitability. So I is also a possibility. But the question is about the inference from the passage. Does it explicitly state inevitability, or is it more about avoiding a crisis?

Option J: Lead to a strengthened economy. The passage doesn't explicitly say that restructuring would strengthen the economy, just that without it, there would be economic crises. So J might not be the best answer.

Now, between H and I. The passage says restructuring is an urgent necessity because delay would cause a crisis. That supports H. It also says society is ripe and has been yearning for change, which suggests it's inevitable. So both H and I could be inferred.

Wait, but the question is about what Gorbachev argued. The passage says perestroika is necessary to avoid crisis, which aligns with H. It also says it's an urgent necessity, implying it's needed now, which could tie into inevitability.

Looking back, the passage states that the society is "ripe for change" and "has long been yearning for it," which suggests that restructuring is not just necessary to prevent a crisis but also that it's something the society is ready for and needs. So I think H is the best answer because it directly addresses the consequence of not acting, which is the crisis.

The passage from Gorbachev's "Perestroika" emphasizes that restructuring is an urgent necessity due to the deep developmental processes in Soviet socialist society. Gorbachev argues that the society is ripe for change and has long desired it, warning that any delay in implementing perestroika could exacerbate the internal situation, potentially leading to serious social, economic, and political crises. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that restructuring is urgent.
- **B** is incorrect as the motivation for restructuring is internal, not external.
- **C** is incorrect because the passage suggests restructuring would prevent, not worsen, the situation.
- **D** is incorrect because restructuring is implied to have significant implications.
- **E** is plausible but not explicitly stated in the passage.
- **F** is incorrect as the focus is on necessity and crisis prevention, not just appeasement.
- **G** is incorrect because the passage does not suggest restructuring would cause collapse.
- **H** is correct because the passage directly links restructuring to avoiding a crisis.
- **I** is plausible but less directly supported compared to H.
- **J** is incorrect as the passage does not explicitly mention economic strengthening.

The best inference is that Gorbachev argued restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis.

Answer: H
