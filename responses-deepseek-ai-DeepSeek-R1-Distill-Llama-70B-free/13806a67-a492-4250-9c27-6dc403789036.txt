Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Darnell buying and selling stocks. Let's see what it's asking. He bought 20 shares of American Telephone and Telegraph common stock at $182.50 per share. Then two months later, he sold them at $168.75 each. The question is asking for his loss per share and the total loss.

Hmm, right, loss per share would be the difference between what he bought each share for and what he sold it for. So I think I should subtract the selling price from the purchase price. Let me write that down.

Purchase price per share is $182.50, selling price is $168.75. So per share loss is 182.50 minus 168.75. Let me calculate that. 182.50 - 168.75.

Wait, 182 minus 168 is 14, and then 0.50 minus 0.75... Oh wait, I can't do that because 0.50 is less than 0.75. So I guess I need to borrow a dollar. So 182.50 is the same as 181 plus 1.50, right? So 181.50 minus 168.75.

Wait, maybe a better way is to just subtract directly. 168.75 from 182.50. Let's do it step by step.

182.50
-168.75
________

Starting from the right. 0 - 5 can't do that, so borrow. So 10 -5 is 5. Then next digit: 4 (since we borrowed) minus 7. Again, can't do, so borrow again. So 14-7 is 7. Next, 1 (after borrowing) minus 6. Wait, wait, maybe I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, 182.50 - 168.75 = ?

Let me think in terms of money. 182.50 is like a dollar eighty-two fifty. So subtracting 168.75, which is a dollar sixty-eight seventy-five.

So 182.50 minus 168.75. 

Hmm, maybe breaking it down. 182.50 - 160 = 22.50. Then subtract 8.75 more. So 22.50 - 8.75 = 13.75. So per share loss is $13.75.

Wait, but wait. Let me check that again. Because 182.50 minus 168.75. Alternatively, 168.75 +13.75 would be 182.50. Yeah, because 168.75 +13 is 181.75, plus 0.75 is 182.50. So yes, per share loss is $13.75.

Now, the total loss would be per share loss multiplied by the number of shares, which is 20.

So 13.75 *20 = ?

Let me calculate that. 13 * 20 is 260, and 0.75 *20 is 15, so 260 +15 is 275. So total loss is $275.00.

Looking at the options, option C says $13.75 per share and $275 total. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me double-check the per share loss.

182.50 minus 168.75. Let's do it as:

182.50
-168.75
= ?

Subtracting the cents first: 50 -75. Can't do that, so borrow a dollar. So 50 becomes 150 cents, minus 75 is 75 cents.

Now for the dollars: 181 (since we borrowed a dollar earlier) minus 168.75's dollar part, which is 168. So 181-168 is 13. So total is 13.75. Yep, that's correct.

Total loss calculation: 20 shares *13.75 per share. 20*13 is 260, 20*0.75 is 15. 260+15=275. So yes, option C is correct.

To determine Mr. Darnell's loss per share and total loss, we start by calculating the difference between the purchase price and the selling price per share. The purchase price per share is $182.50, and the selling price per share is $168.75. 

**Loss per share** is calculated as:  
\[
\text{Loss per share} = \text{Purchase price per share} - \text{Selling price per share}  
\]  
\[
\text{Loss per share} = 182.50 - 168.75 = 13.75  
\]

Next, to find the **total loss**, we multiply the loss per share by the number of shares purchased:  
\[
\text{Total loss} = \text{Loss per share} \times \text{Number of shares}  
\]  
\[
\text{Total loss} = 13.75 \times 20 = 275.00  
\]

Thus, Mr. Darnell's loss per share is $13.75, and his total loss is $275.00. Comparing these results with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**C: $13.75 per share, $275.00 total loss.**
