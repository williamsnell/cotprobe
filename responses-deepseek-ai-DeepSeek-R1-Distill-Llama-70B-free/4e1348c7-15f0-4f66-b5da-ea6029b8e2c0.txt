Okay, so I've got this integral to compute: I = ∫ from -∞ to ∞ of 1/(x² + 1)² dx. Hmm, I remember that integrals involving polynomials in the denominator often relate to trigonometric substitutions or maybe using known integral formulas. Wait, I think the integral of 1/(x² + a²) is something like (1/a) arctan(x/a), but that's for the first power. This one is squared in the denominator, so it's a bit different.

I recall that for even powers, maybe integration by parts could work. Let me think. If I set u = 1/(x² + 1), then du/dx would be something like -2x/(x² +1)^2. Hmm, but that's the denominator I have here. So maybe I can let u be something else. Alternatively, maybe using a substitution involving x = tanθ, since x² +1 becomes sec²θ, which might simplify things.

Wait, let's try substitution. Let x = tanθ, so dx = sec²θ dθ. Then, x² + 1 = tan²θ +1 = sec²θ. So the denominator becomes (sec²θ)^2 = sec^4θ. So the integral becomes ∫ [1/sec^4θ] * sec²θ dθ. Simplifying, that's ∫ [1/sec²θ] dθ, which is ∫ cos²θ dθ.

Oh, wait, I remember that ∫ cos²θ dθ can be integrated using the power-reduction formula: cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So the integral becomes ∫ (1 + cos2θ)/2 dθ, which is (1/2)∫ dθ + (1/2)∫ cos2θ dθ. Integrating term by term, that's (θ/2) + (1/4) sin2θ + C.

But now I need to change back to x variables. So remember that x = tanθ, which means θ = arctan(x). Also, to find sin2θ, I can use the double-angle identity: sin2θ = 2 sinθ cosθ. Since tanθ = x, I can imagine a right triangle where the opposite side is x and the adjacent is 1, so hypotenuse is sqrt(x² +1). So sinθ = x / sqrt(x² +1), and cosθ = 1 / sqrt(x² +1). Therefore, sin2θ = 2*(x/sqrt(x²+1)) * (1/sqrt(x²+1)) ) = 2x/(x²+1).

Putting it all together, the integral is [ (θ/2) + (1/4)(2x/(x²+1)) ) ] + C. Simplifying, that's (θ/2) + (x/(2(x² +1))) + C.

Now, evaluating from -∞ to ∞, so I need to compute the definite integral. Let's think about the limits. When x approaches ∞, θ approaches π/2, and when x approaches -∞, θ approaches -π/2. So the definite integral becomes [ (π/4) + (something) ] minus [ (-π/4) + (something else) ].

Wait, let's plug in the limits. The antiderivative F(x) is (1/2) arctan(x) + x/(2(x² +1)). So F(∞) is (1/2)(π/2) + (∞)/(2(∞² +1)) ) → (π/4) + 0. Because as x approaches infinity, the second term x/(x²+1) behaves like 1/x, which tends to zero. Similarly, F(-∞) is (1/2)(-π/2) + (-∞)/(2(∞² +1)) → (-π/4) + 0. So when we subtract F(-∞) from F(∞), it's [π/4] - [(-π/4)] = π/2.

Wait wait, that can't be right. Because I thought the integral might be π/2, but let me double-check. Because when I calculated, the antiderivative evaluated at infinity gives π/4 and at negative infinity gives -π/4, so their difference is π/2. But wait, earlier when I did substitution, the integral became ∫ cos²θ dθ from θ=-π/2 to θ=π/2. Let me compute that. The integral of cos²θ from -a to a is symmetric, so perhaps it's easier to compute from 0 to π/2 and double it, but let's see.

Wait, the integral of cos²θ from -π/2 to π/2: using the substitution, that would be [θ/2 + (sin2θ)/4 ] evaluated from -π/2 to π/2.

At θ=π/2: θ/2 = π/4, sin(2*(π/2))=sin(π)=0. So first term is π/4 + 0.
At θ=-π/2: θ/2 = -π/4, sin(2*(-π/2))=sin(-π)=0. So term is -π/4 + 0.
Subtracting, (π/4) - (-π/4) = π/2. So that's correct.

So the integral I is equal to π/2, which is approximately 1.5708. Looking at the options, option G is 1.57, which matches.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: I remember that the integral of 1/(x² + a²)^n can be expressed using the beta function or gamma function. For example, ∫_{-∞}^∞ dx/(x² + a²)^n = sqrt(π) * Γ(n - 1/2) / (a^{2n-1} Γ(n)) ) or something like that. Let me think for a=1 and n=2.

So using the formula, ∫_{-∞}^∞ dx/(x² +1)^2 = sqrt(π) * Γ(2 - 1/2) / (1^{2*2-1} Γ(2)) ) = sqrt(π) * Γ(3/2) / (1^3 Γ(2)).

I know that Γ(3/2) = (1/2) sqrt(π), and Γ(2) = 1! = 1. So substituting: sqrt(π) * ( (1/2) sqrt(π) ) / (1 * 1) ) = sqrt(π) * (sqrt(π)/2) ) = (π)/2. So that's the same as before, π/2, which is about 1.5708. So option G again.

I think I'm confident that the answer is G: 1.57.

To compute the integral \( I = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(x^2 + 1)^2} \, dx \), we can use the substitution \( x = \tan\theta \), which simplifies the denominator. With this substitution, \( dx = \sec^2\theta \, d\theta \), and \( x^2 + 1 = \sec^2\theta \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int \frac{1}{(\sec^2\theta)^2} \cdot \sec^2\theta \, d\theta = \int \cos^2\theta \, d\theta.
\]

Using the power-reduction formula, \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{1 + \cos2\theta}{2} \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int \cos^2\theta \, d\theta = \frac{1}{2} \int d\theta + \frac{1}{2} \int \cos2\theta \, d\theta.
\]

Integrating term by term:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \int d\theta = \frac{\theta}{2}, \quad \frac{1}{2} \int \cos2\theta \, d\theta = \frac{1}{4} \sin2\theta.
\]

Thus, the antiderivative is:

\[
\frac{\theta}{2} + \frac{\sin2\theta}{4}.
\]

Reverting to \( x \), we note that \( \theta = \arctan(x) \) and \( \sin2\theta = \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} \). Therefore, the antiderivative becomes:

\[
\frac{\arctan(x)}{2} + \frac{x}{2(x^2 + 1)}.
\]

To evaluate the definite integral from \( -\infty \) to \( \infty \), we compute the limits. As \( x \to \infty \), \( \arctan(x) \to \frac{\pi}{2} \), and as \( x \to -\infty \), \( \arctan(x) \to -\frac{\pi}{2} \). The term \( \frac{x}{2(x^2 + 1)} \) approaches 0 in both limits. Thus, the integral evaluates to:

\[
\left[\frac{\pi}{4}\right] - \left[-\frac{\pi}{4}\right] = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

The value of the integral is \( \frac{\pi}{2} \), which is approximately \( 1.57 \). Comparing this result to the given options, the correct answer is:

**G: 1.57**.
