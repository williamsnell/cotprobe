Okay, so I have this question about an experiment Jared is conducting. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying the independent variable in Jared's experiment. From what I remember, the independent variable is the factor that the researcher manipulates or changes to see if it affects the dependent variable.

So, the scenario is that Jared thinks attending psychology lectures isn't necessary. He believes that just reading the review book, watching "Discovering Psychology," and taking the tests will yield the same results as attending lectures. To test this, he sets up an experiment.

Wait, so Jared's hypothesis is that you can do just as well without going to lectures. That means he's testing two different conditions: one where people attend lectures and another where they don't, but they still do the other activities like reading and watching the videos.

The independent variable here is the factor he's manipulating. So in this case, it's whether or not the students attend the lectures. Because Jared is changing that variable to see how it affects the outcome, which I assume is the test scores or performance.

Looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A: just taking tests. Hmm, that's more about the dependent variable, maybe. The tests are probably the measure of performance.

Option B: going to lectures, reading, and watching. That sounds like one of the conditions, but the independent variable is just whether they go to lectures or not. So B includes all the other variables as part of the same group.

Option C: going to lectures and watching. Again, that's combining two variables. But Jared's hypothesis is about the lectures being unnecessary when the other two are done. So the variable is presence vs absence of lectures.

Option D: not going to lectures, reading, and watching. That's the other condition. So D is the treatment where they don't attend lectures but do the other stuff.

Option E: going to lecture classes. This seems like one part of the independent variable. Because the variable is whether they attend or not.

Option F: reading the review book. But in both conditions, they're doing this. So it's not the variable being changed.

Option G: watching the video. Same as F, both groups are doing it, so it's a controlled variable, not the independent.

Option H: review book and video. Again, both groups are doing these, so not the variable.

Option I: not going to lectures and just taking tests. I'm not sure. The dependent variable might be the test scores, but the independent variable is just the lectures part.

Option J: test scores. That's definitely the dependent variable, not the independent.

So the independent variable is whether the students attend lectures or not. So the options that reflect that are E and D. Because E is going to lectures, and D is not. But wait, the independent variable is the factor being manipulated, so it's the presence or absence of attending lectures. So in the experiment, Jared is probably having one group attend lectures (and do the other things) and another group not attend lectures (but do the other things). 

So the independent variable is whether they go to lectures or not. Looking at the options, E is "going to lecture classes," which is one condition. D is the other condition, not going. But wait, the independent variable is the variable itself, not one of the conditions. So the variable is "attendance at lectures." But the way the options are phrased, E is just one part.

Alternatively, looking back, the question asks for the independent variable in Jared's experiment. So what is he changing? He's changing whether people attend lectures or not. So the variable is whether they attend or not. So the independent variable is "going to lecture classes." Because that's what he's manipulating.

Wait, but E is "going to lecture classes." Is that the variable? Or is the variable whether they attend or not, making E one level of the variable. Hmm.

Wait, the independent variable is the variable that is being controlled and changed by the researcher. So Jared is testing two groups: one that attends lectures, and one that doesn't. So the independent variable is attendance in lectures. So the variable is whether they attend or not. So the options would be either E or D, but E is just one condition.

Wait, looking at the options, the choices are about what the independent variable is. So the variable is "going to lecture classes" because that's what's being manipulated. So E is the independent variable.

Wait, but let me think again. The independent variable is the cause, and the dependent is the effect. So if Jared is testing whether attending lectures affects test performance, then attending lectures is the independent variable. So yes, E is the answer.

Alternatively, option B says going to lectures along with reading and watching. But no, because both groups are reading and watching, except one also attends lectures. So the variable is whether they attend lectures.

So E is the correct answer.

The independent variable in Jared's experiment is the factor he manipulates to test his hypothesis. Jared's hypothesis is that attending psychology lectures is unnecessary if one reads the review book, watches "Discovering Psychology," and takes the tests. To test this, he likely compares two groups: one that attends lectures (and does the other activities) and one that does not attend lectures (but still reads the review book, watches the videos, and takes the tests). 

The independent variable is whether the students attend lectures or not, as this is the factor Jared is manipulating to observe its effect on the outcome (likely test scores). Among the options, "going to lecture classes" (Option E) represents the independent variable, as it is the factor being manipulated to test the hypothesis.

Answer: E
