Question:

While relaxing at poolside one Sunday afternoon, a homeowner was struck by a golf ball driven by a 14-year-old boy who was playing the ninth hole at the local golf course. The fairway for the ninth hole was 65 feet wide and 437 yards long, with a dogleg in an easterly direction. Between the fairway and the homeowner's property was a "rough," containing brush and low-lying trees. The boy had hit a towering shot down the middle of the fairway that deflected off a tree and struck the homeowner in the head. The homeowner brought suit against the boy for his injuries suffered when he was hit by the golf ball. At trial, the boy offered uncontested evidence that golf balls from the golf course regularly traversed onto the homeowner's property two to three times a day. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the boy's liability for trespass?

Options:

A: The boy is not liable, because he did not intentionally cause the golf ball to traverse onto theplaintiff's property.
B: Because the golf ball did not substantiallyinterfere with the plaintiff's use and enjoymentof his land, the boy would not be held liable.
C: The boy is not liable because the golf course should have better protective measures to prevent golf balls from entering neighboring properties.
D: The boy would be liable only if he was aware that his golf balls regularly traversed onto the homeowner's property.
E: The boy is liable because the frequency of golf balls entering the homeowner's property suggests a lack of care in his play.
F: The boy would be liable for the unpermittedintrusion of the golf ball onto the plaintiff'sproperty.
G: The boy is liable because he was negligent in hitting the golf ball in the direction of the homeowner's property.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically trespass. Hmm, let me think through it. So the situation is a homeowner getting hit by a golf ball struck by a 14-year-old boy. The golf course's ninth hole is 65 feet wide and 437 yards long with a dogleg to the east. Between the fairway and the homeowner's property is a rough with brush and trees. The boy hit the ball down the middle, but it deflected off a tree and hit the homeowner.

The homeowner sued the boy. At trial, the boy presented evidence that golf balls regularly go onto the homeowner's property two to three times a day. So the question is about the boy's liability for trespass.

I remember that trespass to land (or property) is an intentional tort. The elements are intentional act, causing an intrusion which results in an invasion of the plaintiff's possessory interest, causing actual damage or a substantial interference with use and enjoyment.

Wait, but the traditional view is that trespass requires intent to enter the property, not just intent to do the act that causes the entry. So, for example, if I throw a rock and it lands on your property, I intended to throw the rock, but did I intend for it to land there? If I didn't, then maybe I'm not liable for trespass, but could be for negligence instead.

So in this case, the boy hit the ball down the middle of the fairway. The ball deflected off a tree. So he didn't intend for the ball to go onto the homeowner's property. He was just playing golf. So under trespass, which is intentional, the boy's intentional act was hitting the ball, but did he intend for it to go onto the plaintiff's land? Probably not.

But wait, there's another angle. The boy presented evidence that balls regularly go onto the property. Does that affect anything? Maybe it's about notice. Like, if the boy knew or should have known that his balls might end up there, but that's more for negligence.

Looking at the options:

A: Boy not liable because no intent to have ball go onto property. That sounds correct because trespass requires intent to enter.

B: No substantial interference. But the interference here was that the ball hit the homeowner in the head, causing injury, so that's a substantial interference. So B might not be right.

C: Blames the golf course. They're a third party, but the question is about the boy's liability, not others. So C is not the reason the boy isn't liable.

D: Liability only if aware of regular trespass. This is interesting. If the boy knew that balls often go there, maybe he should have taken precautions. But for trespass, the intent is the key, not knowledge. So D might be more about negligence.

E: Liability because frequency shows lack of care. That sounds like negligence again, not trespass. So E isn't about intentional trespass.

F: Liable for unpermitted intrusion. But that's trespass, so if he's liable, F would be correct. But the issue is whether he intended the intrusion.

G: Negligent in hitting towards the property. That's negligence, not trespass. So G is about a different tort.

So, the key here is whether the boy's act was intentional. He hit the ball intending to play golf, but not intending for it to go onto the plaintiff's property. Therefore, under trespass, he's not liable because he didn't intend the ball to go there.

So the answer should be A. Because he didn't intentionally cause the ball to go onto the property, he's not liable for trespass.

Wait, but another thought: Some jurisdictions might apply a theory of "intent" based on knowledge that the action could cause the result. Like, if the boy knew that balls often go there, maybe his act of hitting could be considered intentional as to the consequence. But I think that's more about recklessness, which is different. Trespass is about intent, not recklessness.

So I stick with A as the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether the 14-year-old boy is liable for trespass after a golf ball he struck inadvertently entered the homeowner's property and caused injury. Trespass to land is an intentional tort requiring an intentional act that causes an intrusion onto the plaintiff's property, resulting in an invasion of their possessory interest. The key issue is whether the boy intended for the golf ball to enter the homeowner's property.

The boy hit the ball down the middle of the fairway, and it deflected off a tree onto the homeowner's property. There is no evidence that he intended for the ball to go onto the homeowner's property; his intent was to play golf. While the boy presented evidence that golf balls regularly enter the homeowner's property, this speaks more to potential negligence rather than intent to trespass. Trespass requires intent to cause the intrusion, not merely knowledge that such an outcome might occur.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. The boy did not intentionally cause the ball to enter the homeowner's property, so he is not liable for trespass.
- **B**: Incorrect. The ball caused significant harm (hitting the homeowner in the head), so there was substantial interference.
- **C**: Incorrect. The question focuses on the boy's liability, not the golf course's responsibility.
- **D**: Incorrect. Trespass requires intent, not awareness of regular trespass.
- **E**: Incorrect. This pertains to negligence, not trespass.
- **F**: Incorrect. The boy did not intentionally cause the intrusion, so he is not liable for trespass.
- **G**: Incorrect. This refers to negligence, not trespass.

The correct answer is **A**, as the boy did not intend for the golf ball to enter the homeowner's property, which is a required element for trespass liability.
