Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a train rounding a curve. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking for the acceleration of the train as it goes around the curve. I remember that when an object moves in a circular path, it experiences centripetal acceleration. Right, centripetal acceleration is the acceleration directed towards the center of the circle.

The given data: the train's speed is 60 miles per hour, and the radius of the curve is 484 feet. Oh wait, units! I should make sure they're consistent. The speed is in miles per hour, but the radius is in feet. I need to convert the speed to feet per second because the standard unit for acceleration in this context is feet per second squared.

How do I convert miles per hour to feet per second? I think the conversion factor is that 1 mile per hour is equal to 22/15 feet per second. Let me double-check that. Oh yes, because 1 mile is 5280 feet and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So 5280 divided by 3600 is 1.466..., which is 22/15 when simplified. So 60 miles per hour would be 60 multiplied by 22/15. Let me calculate that.

60 * (22/15) = (60/15)*22 = 4 * 22 = 88 feet per second. So the speed v is 88 ft/s.

Now, the formula for centripetal acceleration is a = v² / r. Got it. Plugging in the numbers: v is 88, r is 484. So a = (88)^2 / 484.

Let's compute 88 squared. 80 squared is 6400, 8 squared is 64, and the cross term is 2*80*8=1280. So (80+8)^2 = 6400 + 1280 +64 = 6400+1280 is 7680, plus 64 is 7744. So 88 squared is 7744.

Now, divide that by the radius, which is 484. So 7744 / 484. Let me see. Hmm, 484 times 16 is 7744 because 484 * 10 is 4840, *2 is 9680 which is too much. Wait, 484 * 16. Let me calculate 484 * 10 = 4840, 484*5=2420, so 484*(10+5)=7260. Then 484*6=2904, so 7260+2904=10164, which is too much. Wait, maybe I should find a better way. Alternatively, 484 times 16: 484 * 16 = (480+4)*16 = 480*16 +4*16 = 7680 +64 = 7744. Yes! So 7744 divided by 484 is 16. So the acceleration is 16 ft/s².

Wait, but let me make sure I did that correctly. Because 484 * 16. Let me compute 16 * 484:

16 * 400 = 6400
16 * 80 = 1280
16 *4=64
Adding them together: 6400 + 1280 = 7680 +64=7744. Yep, that's correct. So 7744/484 is 16.

So the acceleration is 16 ft/s². Looking at the options, option H is 16 ft/sec². So the answer should be H.

To determine the acceleration of the train as it rounds the curve, we use the formula for centripetal acceleration:

\[
a = \frac{v^2}{r}
\]

### Step 1: Convert speed to consistent units
The train's speed is given as 60 miles per hour (mi/hr), but the radius is in feet. To ensure consistency, we convert the speed to feet per second (ft/s). Using the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{mi/hr} = \frac{22}{15} \, \text{ft/s}\):

\[
v = 60 \, \text{mi/hr} \times \frac{22}{15} \, \text{ft/s per mi/hr} = 88 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

### Step 2: Apply the centripetal acceleration formula
The radius of the curve is \(r = 484 \, \text{ft}\), and the speed is \(v = 88 \, \text{ft/s}\). Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
a = \frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{88^2}{484}
\]

First, calculate \(88^2\):

\[
88^2 = 7744
\]

Now divide by \(484\):

\[
a = \frac{7744}{484} = 16 \, \text{ft/s}^2
\]

### Final Answer
The acceleration of the train is \(16 \, \text{ft/s}^2\), which corresponds to option **H**.
