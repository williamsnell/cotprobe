Okay, so I have this economics question here about diminishing marginal returns in short-run production. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with how adding more units of a variable input, like labor, affects output. Wait, right, the Law of Diminishing Returns is a key concept here.

So the question is asking when diminishing marginal returns begin. The options are A through J, each describing different scenarios involving total product, average product, and marginal product of labor. I need to think about each term.

First, let's clarify the terms. The total product of labor (TPL) is the total output produced with a given amount of labor. The average product of labor (APL) is TPL divided by the number of workers, so it's like output per worker. Marginal product of labor (MPL) is the additional output produced by adding one more worker.

Diminishing marginal returns happen when each additional unit of labor adds less to output than the previous one. So, MPL starts to decrease as more labor is added. But when does this start happening?

I think it's when the MPL begins to fall. But wait, there's a point where MPL is at its maximum and then starts to decline. So the point where MPL peaks and then starts to decrease is the point where diminishing returns begin.

Looking at the options:

Option A: TPL becomes negative. No, that doesn't make sense because TPL is total output, which can't be negative. So not A.

Option B: APL becomes negative. Similarly, APL would be positive as long as TPL is positive. So B is unlikely.

Option C: MPL becomes negative. That's a possibility, but that's not when diminishing returns start. Negative MPL would mean adding another worker reduces total output, which is beyond diminishing returnsâ€”maybe that's when production starts to fall, but not the start of diminishing.

Option D: MPL remains constant. That's more like constant returns, so not when diminishing starts.

Option E: TPL remains constant. Not sure, but I think TPL keeps increasing until maybe workers become too many that output starts to fall, but that's beyond diminishing returns.

Option F: MPL begins to fall. This sounds right. Diminishing returns start when each additional worker adds less, so MPL starts to decrease.

Option G: Marginal and average product both begin to fall. I'm not sure. When MPL starts to fall, average product might also start to fall, but maybe not immediately. Or perhaps after a certain point. Hmm, but the question is about when diminishing marginal returns begin, which is specifically about MPL.

Option H: TPL begins to fall. That's when marginal product is negative. So this is after diminishing returns have set in for a while, maybe even when MPL is negative.

Option I: APL remains constant. I don't think that's relevant here. APL is average, so it might change as more workers are added, but I'm not sure when.

Option J: APL begins to fall. This might happen after a certain point, but I think the initial point when diminishing returns start is when MPL starts to decrease.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be F. Because diminishing returns begin when the marginal product of labor starts to fall. Like, the first time MPL decreases, that's when it starts. Before that, it was increasing or constant.

Wait, but another thought: the Law of Diminishing Returns doesn't necessarily mean that MPL is falling from the very first worker. It's more about when adding another worker leads to less additional output than the previous one. So the point at which the MPL starts to decline is when diminishing returns begin.

Yes, so option F is correct: when marginal product of labor begins to fall.

Diminishing marginal returns in short-run production occur when the marginal product of labor (MPL) begins to fall. This happens as additional units of labor are added, and each new worker contributes less to total output than the previous one. Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, E, H, I, J**: These options describe scenarios unrelated to the starting point of diminishing marginal returns. For example, MPL becoming negative (C) or TPL falling (H) occur after diminishing returns have already set in, while others like APL remaining constant (I) or becoming negative (B) are not relevant to the onset of diminishing returns.

- **F**: This correctly identifies the start of diminishing marginal returns, as it is when MPL begins to decline.

- **G**: While both MPL and average product of labor (APL) may eventually fall, the question specifically asks about the beginning of diminishing returns, which is best captured by the decline in MPL alone.

Thus, the correct answer is **F**, as diminishing marginal returns begin when the marginal product of labor starts to fall.

Answer: F
