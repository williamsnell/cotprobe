Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the percentage of sulfur in a tomato. Let's see, the tomato weighs 60.0 grams, and after some reactions, they got 0.466 grams of BaSO4. Hmm, I think the steps involve some stoichiometry, right?

Alright, first, I remember that when you precipitate sulfate ions with barium, you form BaSO4. So the sulfur in the tomato must have come from the sulfate formed after digestion. The process probably converted all the sulfur into sulfate ions, which then combined with barium to form the precipitate.

So I need to find out how much sulfur is in that BaSO4 precipitate. Then, I can relate that to the original tomato mass to find the percentage.

BaSO4 has a molar mass. Let me calculate that. Barium (Ba) has an atomic weight of about 137.33 g/mol, sulfur (S) is 32.07 g/mol, and oxygen (O) is 16.00 each. So BaSO4 would be 137.33 + 32.07 + 4*16. Let's see: 4*16 is 64. So adding them up: 137.33 +32.07 is 169.4, plus 64 gives 233.4 g/mol. So the molar mass of BaSO4 is 233.4 g/mol.

The mass of BaSO4 obtained is 0.466 grams. To find the moles of BaSO4, I divide the mass by the molar mass. So 0.466 / 233.4. Let me compute that. Let's see, 0.466 divided by 233 is approximately 0.002 moles. Wait, more precisely, 233.4 times 0.002 is 0.4668, which is a bit more than 0.466. So maybe it's roughly 0.001997 moles, which is approximately 0.001997 mol.

But wait, each mole of BaSO4 contains one mole of sulfur. So the moles of sulfur would be the same as moles of BaSO4. So 0.001997 moles of S.

Now, to find the mass of sulfur, I multiply moles by the atomic weight of sulfur. Sulfur is 32.07 g/mol. So 0.001997 * 32.07. Let me compute that. 0.002 *32 is 0.064, so subtracting a little: 0.001997 is 0.002 - 0.000003. So 0.002 *32.07 is 0.06414, then subtract 0.000003 *32.07=0.00009621. So 0.06414 - 0.00009621 is approximately 0.06404379 grams of sulfur.

So the mass of sulfur is about 0.06404 grams.

Now, the tomato was 60.0 grams. The percentage of sulfur is (mass of sulfur / mass of tomato) * 100%.

So 0.06404 / 60.0 * 100. Let's calculate that. 0.06404 divided by 60 is 0.0010673. Multiply by 100 gives 0.10673%. So approximately 0.107%.

Looking at the options, let me check. Option C is 0.11%, which is close. Option G is 0.075%, which is lower. Option D is 0.14%, a bit higher. Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me double-check the BaSO4 molar mass calculation. Ba is 137.33, S is 32.07, O is 16. So 137.33 +32.07 is 169.4. O is 4*16=64. So 169.4 +64=233.4 g/mol. That seems right.

Moles of BaSO4: 0.466 g /233.4 g/mol = let's compute 0.466 / 233.4. Hmm, 233.4 * 0.002 is 0.4668, which is a bit higher than 0.466. So 0.466 /233.4 = approximately 0.001995 mol. So that's about 0.001995 mol of BaSO4, which is 0.001995 mol of S.

Sulfur mass is 0.001995 *32.07 = let's see, 0.002 *32.07 is 0.06414. Subtract 0.000005 *32.07 (since 0.001995 is 0.002-0.000005), so 0.06414 - 0.00016035 = 0.06398 grams.

So 0.06398 g S in 60 g tomato.

Percentage is (0.06398 /60) *100 = (0.0010633) *100 = 0.10633%, so about 0.106%. The closest option is C:0.11%, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 0.065%
B: 0.18%
C: 0.11%
D: 0.14%
E: 0.25%
F: 0.032%
G: 0.075%
H: 0.466%
I: 0.5%
J: 0.20%

Wait, 0.106% is between 0.11% and 0.10%. So 0.11% is option C, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute moles of BaSO4: 0.466 / 233.4.

233.4 is approximately 233.4 grams per mole. So 0.466 /233.4 = ?

Let me compute this step by step.

233.4 * 0.002 = 0.4668. Oh wait, that's exactly the mass we have (0.466 g is just under 0.4668). So 0.466 g is 0.002 moles minus a tiny bit.

Wait, 0.4668 is 0.002 moles. So 0.466 is 0.466 /233.4 = 0.001995 mol. So approximately 0.001995 mol.

Then, the sulfur is 0.001995 *32.07 g.

Calculating: 0.001995 *32.07.

32.07 * 0.002 is 0.06414. But since it's 0.001995, it's 0.002 - 0.000005. So 0.06414 - (32.07 *0.000005) = 0.06414 - 0.00016035 = 0.06398 grams.

So 0.06398 grams of S in 60 grams tomato.

Percentage: (0.06398 /60) *100 = (0.0010633)*100 = 0.10633%.

So approximately 0.106%. Looking at the options, option C is 0.11%, which is the closest. But wait, let me check if I made any mistake in the molar masses.

Wait, maybe I should use more precise molar masses.

Ba: 137.327 g/mol; S:32.065 g/mol; O:15.999 g/mol.

So BaSO4 molar mass is 137.327 +32.065 +4*(15.999)=?

137.327 +32.065 =169.392. 4*(15.999)=63.996. Total is 169.392 +63.996= 233.388 g/mol.

So 0.466 g / 233.388 g/mol = moles.

Compute 0.466 /233.388.

Let me compute it more accurately.

233.388 × 0.00199 = 233.388 *0.002 would be 0.466776, which is higher than 0.466. So 0.466 is less than 0.466776.

So how much is 0.466 /233.388?

Let me compute 233.388 * x = 0.466.

x = 0.466 /233.388 ≈ 0.001995 mol.

So 0.001995 mol of BaSO4, which equals 0.001995 mol of S.

Mass of S: 0.001995 *32.065 g.

0.001995 *32.065 = let's compute:

32.065 * 0.002 =0.06413. But since it's 0.001995, which is 0.002 -0.000005.

So 0.06413 - (32.065 *0.000005) = 0.06413 -0.000160325=0.063969675 grams.

So 0.063969675 grams S.

Percentage in tomato: (0.063969675 /60.0 ) *100 = (0.00106449375) *100 =0.106449375%.

So approximately 0.1064%.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C (0.11%) and option D is 0.14%. Wait, 0.106 is 0.11 when rounded to two decimal places.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation should consider significant figures.

The given data: the tomato is 60.0 grams (three sig figs), and BaSO4 mass is 0.466 grams (three sig figs).

So the final answer should be three sig figs. 0.106% is 0.106% → 0.106%.

Wait, but let's compute the exact value.

Wait, 0.063969675 grams S.

Percentage is (0.063969675 /60.0 ) *100 = (0.00106449375) *100 =0.106449375%.

So 0.1064%, which would be 0.106% when rounded to three decimal places, but when considering significant figures, since the given masses have three, the answer should have three as well.

Wait, 0.1064% → 0.106% (three sig figs). Hmm, but wait, 0.106449 is approximately 0.1064, which is 0.106 when rounded to three decimal places. But the percentage is 0.106%, which is 0.11% when rounded to two decimal places.

Wait, but the options given are to two decimal places. Let me look again:

Option C is 0.11%, which is 0.11%. So 0.106% is approximately 0.11% when rounded to two decimal places.

Wait, but the question is asking for the percentage. So 0.1064% is approximately 0.106%, or 0.11% when rounded up.

So option C is 0.11%, which would be correct.

Wait, but another approach: maybe I should have considered more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using exact steps without approximating.

Compute moles of BaSO4:

n = 0.466 g /233.388 g/mol = 0.0019947 mol.

Mass of S is n *32.065 g/mol.

0.0019947 *32.065 = let's compute this.

32.065 * 0.0019947.

Compute 32.065 * 0.001 =0.032065.

32.065 *0.0009947= ?

Wait, 0.0009947 is approximately 0.00099.

32.065 *0.00099 = 0.03174335.

So total is 0.032065 +0.03174335 =0.06380835 grams.

Wait, wait, perhaps a better way:

0.0019947 mol *32.065 g/mol.

0.0019947 *32.065 = (0.002 -0.0000053) *32.065.

So 0.002 *32.065 =0.06413.

Subtract 0.0000053 *32.065 =0.0001698.

So 0.06413 -0.0001698 =0.06396 grams.

So 0.06396 grams of S.

Percentage: (0.06396 /60.0 ) *100.

0.06396 /60 is 0.001066.

Multiply by 100: 0.1066%.

So 0.1066% → approximately 0.107% when rounded to three decimal places.

So 0.107%, which is 0.11% when rounded to two decimal places.

So the correct answer should be option C, 0.11%.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option D is 0.14%. Hmm, why is that?

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation steps?

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the molar mass.

Ba: 137.33, S:32.07, O:16.00.

So BaSO4:137.33 +32.07 +4(16) =137.33+32.07=169.4 +64=233.4 g/mol.

So that's correct.

Then, moles of BaSO4 is 0.466 /233.4 = approx 0.001995 mol.

Molar mass of S is 32.07 g/mol.

So 0.001995 *32.07 = let's compute:

0.002 *32.07=0.06414.

But since it's 0.001995, which is 0.002 - 0.000005, so 0.06414 - (32.07 *0.000005)=0.06414 -0.00016035=0.06398 grams.

So 0.06398 grams S.

Percentage in tomato: (0.06398 /60.0)*100 = 0.1063%.

So 0.1063% is approximately 0.106%. When rounded to three significant figures, that's 0.106%, but the options only go to two decimal places.

Looking again, option C is 0.11%, which is 0.11 when rounded to two decimals. 0.1063 is 0.11 when rounded to the nearest hundredth.

So the correct answer is C:0.11%.

To determine the percentage of sulfur in the tomato, we start by analyzing the given data. The tomato weighs 60.0 g, and 0.466 g of BaSO₄ is obtained after the reaction. The sulfur in the tomato is converted into BaSO₄, and we use stoichiometry to calculate the sulfur content.

1. **Molar Mass of BaSO₄**:  
   The molar mass of BaSO₄ is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Ba: } 137.33 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{S: } 32.07 \, \text{g/mol}, \, \text{O: } 16.00 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of BaSO₄} = 137.33 + 32.07 + 4(16.00) = 233.40 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

2. **Moles of BaSO₄**:  
   The moles of BaSO₄ are calculated by dividing the mass of BaSO₄ by its molar mass:  
   \[

   \]

3. **Moles of Sulfur**:  
   Each mole of BaSO₄ contains one mole of sulfur. Therefore, the moles of sulfur are equal to the moles of BaSO₄:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of S} = 0.001995 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

4. **Mass of Sulfur**:  
   The mass of sulfur is calculated by multiplying the moles of sulfur by its atomic weight:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of S} = 0.001995 \, \text{mol} \times 32.07 \, \text{g/mol} \approx 0.06398 \, \text{g}.
   \]

5. **Percentage of Sulfur in the Tomato**:  
   The percentage of sulfur is calculated by dividing the mass of sulfur by the mass of the tomato and multiplying by 100:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage of S} = \left( \frac{0.06398 \, \text{g}}{60.0 \, \text{g}} \right) \times 100 \approx 0.1063\%.
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:  
   The calculated percentage of sulfur is approximately 0.1063%. When rounded to two decimal places, this is 0.11%. Among the given options, the closest match is **C: 0.11%**.
