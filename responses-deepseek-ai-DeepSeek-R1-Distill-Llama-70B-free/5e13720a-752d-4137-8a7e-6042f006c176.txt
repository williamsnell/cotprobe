Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about dry ice sublimating in a fume hood and determining the minimum weight that would make the atmosphere hazardous. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's think it through.

First, let's understand the setup. The fume hood is closed and has a volume of 6000 liters. It's maintained at 1 atm pressure and 27°C. Initially, there's no CO2 present. The technician isn't conditioned, so when CO2 concentration hits 10% by volume, it's dangerous. If the ventilation stops, dry ice (solid CO2) will sublimate, and we need to find the minimum weight of CO2 that would bring the concentration to 10%.

Alright, let's break it down. The key points are:

1. Volume of the fume hood: 6000 L.
2. Temperature: 27°C, which is 300 K (since 273 + 27 = 300).
3. Pressure: 1 atm.
4. CO2 concentration threshold: 10% by volume.

So, the problem is about finding the volume of CO2 gas that makes up 10% of the fume hood's atmosphere. From there, we can find how many moles of CO2 that is, and then convert moles to grams or kilograms to find the weight of dry ice needed.

Wait, right, because when dry ice sublimates, it goes from solid CO2 directly to gaseous CO2. So the amount that sublimates (turns into gas) will contribute to the CO2 concentration.

Let's start with calculating the total volume of the fume hood. But wait, the fume hood's volume is 6000 L, so at 10% CO2, the volume of CO2 would be 0.10 * 6000 L = 600 L. Hmm, but wait, gases are measured in terms of moles and partial pressures, so perhaps using the ideal gas law would be better here.

Wait, no, wait. Since the fume hood is at a constant pressure and temperature, the partial pressure of CO2 can be considered. So the total pressure is 1 atm, and when CO2 is 10% by volume, its partial pressure would be 0.10 * 1 atm = 0.10 atm.

But wait, another approach. The total volume is 6000 L. The concentration is 10% by volume, which in gases, volume percent is the same as mole percent because of Avogadro's law (same pressure and temperature, volumes are proportional to moles). So 10% by volume means that CO2 makes up 10% of the total moles in the fume hood.

So the first thing is to find out how many moles of gas are present in the fume hood when it's safe, and then find 10% of that.

Wait, no, the fume hood is initially filled with air (or whatever), but the problem says there's no CO2 initially. So the initial moles are from air, but as CO2 sublimates, it adds to the moles in the fume hood. Wait, but the fume hood is a closed system, so the total pressure is maintained. Oh, wait, the problem says it's maintained at constant pressure. So perhaps the total pressure remains 1 atm as CO2 is added, and the other gases (air) are somehow adjusted? Or maybe the system's volume isn't changing, so adding CO2 would increase the total pressure, but the problem says it's maintained at 1 atm, so perhaps it's a fixed volume and the pressure is kept constant by some ventilation, but the ventilation has stopped. Hmm, no, wait the question says, if the ventilation stops, what's the min weight. So maybe the volume is fixed at 6000 L, and the pressure is fixed at 1 atm because the fume hood is somehow maintaining it, but perhaps when the ventilation stops, the CO2 builds up until it reaches 10% concentration.

Wait, maybe the approach is to calculate the moles of air initially present in the fume hood. Then, the moles of CO2 required to reach 10% of the total moles would be 0.10 times the initial moles of air.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's say initially, the fume hood is filled with air, which has a certain number of moles. Then, when CO2 is added, the total moles increase. But since the pressure is constant (1 atm), the total moles in the fume hood would be the same as before? Or does the CO2 add to the existing air, increasing the total pressure beyond 1 atm? But the problem says the pressure is maintained at 1.00 atm. Hmm, perhaps the fume hood is somehow kept at 1 atm, so as CO2 is added, some air is displaced or the volume adjusts. But the volume is fixed at 6000 L. So I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the situation as a fixed volume (6000 L), fixed temperature (27°C), and fixed pressure (1 atm), with CO2 being added until it makes up 10% of the atmosphere. So the total pressure is 1 atm, and the partial pressure of CO2 is 0.10 atm.

Wait, that makes more sense. So using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. For CO2, the partial pressure is 0.10 atm, and the volume is 6000 L.

So, let's compute the moles of CO2 needed.

P = 0.10 atm
V = 6000 L
R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K
T = 300 K

n = (P * V) / (R * T) = (0.10 atm * 6000 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 300 K)

Let me compute that.

0.1 * 6000 = 600.

Denominator: 0.0821 * 300 ≈ 24.63.

So n ≈ 600 / 24.63 ≈ let's see, 24.63 times 24 is about 591.12, since 24*24=576, 0.63*24≈15.12, total 576+15.12=591.12. So 600 is approximately 24.63 * 24.36 ≈ 600. So n ≈ 24.36 moles.

Wait, let me compute 600 / 24.63:

24.63 × 24 = 591.12 → 600-591.12=8.88 left.

8.88 /24.63 ≈ 0.36.

So n ≈ 24.36 mol.

Wait, or let me compute it more accurately.

6000 L * 0.10 atm = 600 L·atm.

R*T = 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63 L·atm/mol.

n = 600 / 24.63 ≈ 24.36 moles.

So the moles of CO2 needed is approx 24.36 moles.

Now, to find the weight, we multiply by molar mass of CO2. CO2 has molar mass of 44.01 g/mol (12.01 for C, 16.00*2 for O).

So weight = 24.36 mol * 44.01 g/mol.

Let me compute that:

24 * 44 = 1056 g.

0.36 mol *44 g/mol = approx 15.84 g.

So total is approx 1056 +15.84=1071.84 grams, which is about 1072 grams, or 1.072 kg.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option I:950g, option C is 800g, option D is 1.10 kg, option B is 1.25 kg, option A is 1.00 kg. Hmm, 1.072 kg is closest to option D:1.10 kg, but perhaps a bit lower. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

n = (0.10 atm *6000 L) / (0.0821 *300) 

= (600) / (24.63) 

= approx 24.36 moles.

Yes, that's correct.

Molar mass of CO2 is 44.01 g/mol.

24.36 *44.01 = ?

Let me compute:

24 *44 = 1056.

24 * 0.01 = 0.24 → 24.36*44.01 = (24 + 0.36)*44.01.

So 24 *44.01 = 24*(44 +0.01) = 24*44=1056 + 24*0.01=0.24 → 1056.24.

0.36 *44.01 = 15.8836.

So total is 1056.24 +15.8836=1072.1236 grams.

So approximately 1072 grams, which is 1.072 kg.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.10 kg, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another approach: Alternatively, thinking in terms of the total moles in the fume hood before and after.

Wait, initially, the fume hood has air with negligible CO2. So initial moles of air can be calculated, then the CO2 added will contribute to the total moles, and the CO2's mole fraction is 10%.

Wait, let me think again. Let's say initially, the fume hood is filled with air, which is at 1 atm, 27°C, 6000 L. So initial moles of air, n_air = (1 atm *6000 L) / (0.0821 *300) = 6000/(24.63) ≈ 243.6 moles.

Now, when CO2 sublimates, it adds n moles of CO2, so the total moles become (243.6 + n). The mole fraction of CO2 is n/(243.6 +n) = 0.10.

So, 0.10 = n/(243.6 +n)

Multiply both sides by denominator:

0.10*(243.6 +n) = n

24.36 + 0.10n = n

24.36 = 0.90n

n = 24.36 / 0.90 ≈ 27.0667 moles.

Wait, that's different from the previous approach. So which is correct?

Hmm, I'm confused now. So which approach is right?

In the first approach, I considered the partial pressure of CO2 as 0.10 atm, leading to n=24.36 moles. But in the second approach, considering that the mole fraction is 10%, leading to n≈27.07 moles.

Wait, but the problem says the concentration is 10% by volume. For gases at same T and P, volume percent equals mole percent. So perhaps the second approach is correct.

Wait, let me clarify: In a gas mixture at the same T and P, the mole fraction is equal to the volume fraction. So, if CO2 is 10% by volume, it is 10% of the total moles.

Wait, but the first approach assumed that the partial pressure is 0.10 atm, which would be correct if the total pressure is 1 atm. So, perhaps both approaches are valid, but perhaps the second approach is more accurate because it accounts for the fact that adding CO2 increases the total moles, but the pressure remains at 1 atm. Hmm, but the problem states that the fume hood is maintained at a constant pressure of 1 atm. So, when CO2 is added, perhaps the volume would change? But the volume is fixed at 6000 L, as it's a closed fume hood.

Wait, now I'm getting more confused. Let me think carefully.

If the fume hood is a closed system (fixed volume) and the pressure is maintained at 1 atm, perhaps by some external control, then when CO2 is added, the total moles in the system would increase, but the pressure would remain at 1 atm by perhaps allowing other gases to be removed. Hmm, but that complicates things, and the problem doesn't mention anything about other gases being removed. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplifying and assuming that the system's pressure remains 1 atm as CO2 is added, which would require that the volume changes, but in this case, the volume is fixed. So perhaps the initial approach where the partial pressure is 0.10 atm is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the fume hood as a fixed volume (6000 L), fixed temperature (300 K), and fixed pressure (1 atm). So as CO2 sublimates, the moles of CO2 increase, and the mole fraction of CO2 becomes 0.10.

So, the total pressure is 1 atm, and the partial pressure of CO2 is 0.10 atm. So, using the ideal gas law, for CO2:

n = (P * V) / (R T) = (0.10 atm *6000 L) / (0.0821 *300) ≈ 24.36 moles.

So the weight would be 24.36 *44.01 g/mol ≈ 1072 g, which is about 1.072 kg.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D:1.10 kg, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to consider that the CO2's mole fraction is 10% of the total moles in the system, which would be higher because the total moles have increased.

Wait, in the earlier second approach, where initial moles are 243.6 (from air), and CO2 adds n moles, so that n/(243.6 +n) =0.10 → n≈27.07 moles. So the weight would be 27.07 *44.01 ≈ 1192 grams, which is 1.192 kg. That's not matching any option exactly, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the confusion arises from whether the 10% is by volume in the entire atmosphere, meaning that the partial pressure of CO2 is 0.10 atm. Because in a gas mixture, each gas contributes to the total pressure. So, if CO2 is 10% by volume, its partial pressure is 10% of the total pressure, which is 0.10 atm. So the first approach is correct, and the required moles is 24.36, leading to approx 1072 g, which is 1.072 kg.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D:1.10 kg, but option I is 950g, which is 0.95 kg, and option C is 800g. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the first approach.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute n more accurately.

n = (0.10 atm *6000 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 300 K)

0.10 *6000 = 600.

Denominator: 0.0821 *300 =24.63.

So 600 /24.63 = ?

Let me compute 24.63 ×24 = 591.12. So 24 ×24.63=591.12, which is less than 600 by 8.88.

So 8.88 /24.63 ≈ 0.36. So n=24.36.

Yes, that's correct. So 24.36 moles.

24.36 *44.01 g/mol = let's compute that accurately.

44 *24 = 1056.

44 *0.36=15.84.

So 1056 +15.84=1071.84 grams, so 1.07184 kg, approximately 1.072 kg.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D:1.10 kg. But none of the options exactly match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 10% is by volume of the air, not the total volume. But that doesn't make much sense. No, the problem states "10%, by volume, of the atmosphere", so it's 10% of the total volume.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should use the molar volume at given conditions to find moles, but that might complicate. Alternatively, perhaps the ideal gas law approach is correct, leading to approximately 1.072 kg.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D:1.10 kg. But wait, perhaps the options have rounded values. Let me check the exact calculation again.

Wait, 6000 L *0.10 = 600 L.

n = 600 L * (1 mol)/(24.63 L) )= 24.36 mol.

Wait, 44.01 g/mol *24.36 mol = 1071.7 g, which is 1.0717 kg. So approximately 1.072 kg. So the closest option is D:1.10 kg, but that's 0.028 kg higher than calculated. Alternatively, perhaps I should check for calculation errors.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the denominator. Let me recheck R*T.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

T is 27°C = 300 K.

So R*T =0.0821 *300 =24.63 L·atm/mol.

Yes, correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps considering standard temperature and pressure? No, because the temperature here is 27°C, which is higher than standard temperature (0°C). So STP doesn't apply here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the ideal gas law as I did, leading to approximately 1.072 kg. But in the options, the closest is D:1.10 kg. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects rounding to two significant figures, which would make it 1.1 kg, so option D.

Wait, but let's check if any of the other options match more closely. Option I is 950g, which is 0.95 kg, which is lower than our calculated value. Option C is 800g, which is 0.8 kg. So D is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the moles. Let me think again. Is the 10% by volume referring to the total atmosphere in the fume hood, which includes the original air plus the added CO2?

Wait, yes, that's correct. So the correct approach is to find the moles of CO2 that would make its partial pressure 0.10 atm in a 6000 L volume at 300 K.

So, n = (0.10 *6000)/(0.0821 *300) =24.36 mol.

So weight is 24
