Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the human genome and what fraction of it encodes proteins. Hmm, I remember from biology class that the human genome is made up of a lot of DNA, but not all of it is used to make proteins. I think the question is asking about the protein-coding part.

Wait, I recall that the human genome project found that a smaller percentage of the genome actually codes for proteins. I think it's like around 2% or so. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number. So, the options given are A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

The options are: A:50%, B:5%, C:60%, D:25%, E:90%, F:10%, G:80%, H:75%, I:2%, J:35%. So the possible answers include 2%, which is option I.

But wait, am I mixing up something? I remember that even though only about 2% are protein-coding genes, the rest is non-coding. But some of that non-coding might have regulatory functions or other roles. So the question specifically asks about encoding proteins, so it's about the exons or coding regions.

So, yeah, I think the correct answer is around 2%, which is option I. But I'm a bit confused because I've heard that the number is a bit more. Or maybe the question is considering something else. Alternatively, maybe it's about the total number of genes, but each gene has exons and introns. So the actual DNA that codes for proteins is about 2% of the entire genome.

Another thought: I remember that the human genome has about 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes. The total genome size is about 3 billion base pairs. So, each gene has, on average, maybe around 3,000 base pairs of exons. Let me do a rough calculation: 20,000 genes * 3,000 bp each is 60,000,000 bp. Divide that by 3,000,000,000 total, which is 0.02, so 2%. Yep, that makes sense.

So the answer should be I:2%.

The human genome consists of approximately 3 billion base pairs, but only a small fraction of it encodes proteins. While there are about 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes, the total length of coding regions (exons) is roughly 60 million base pairs. This represents about 2% of the entire genome. The remaining 98% is non-coding, which may have regulatory or other functions but does not directly encode proteins. Therefore, the fraction of the human genome that encodes proteins is approximately 2%.

Answer: I
