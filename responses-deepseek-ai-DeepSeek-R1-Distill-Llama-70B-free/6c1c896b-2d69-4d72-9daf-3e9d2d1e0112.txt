The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Woman, wake up; the bell of reason is being heard throughout the whole universe; discover your rights. Enslaved man has multiplied his strength, [but] having become free, he has become unjust to his companion. Oh, women, women! When will you cease to be blind? What advantage have you received from the Revolution? A more pronounced scorn, a more marked disdain. If our leaders persist, courageously oppose the force of reason to their empty pretentions of superiority. Regardless of what barriers confront you, it is in your power to free yourselves!
Olympe de Gouges, "Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen," 1791
The independence? Nothing of what I hoped for was achieved. I had expected that my children would be able to have an education, but they did not get it. We were poor peasants then, we are poor peasants now. Nothing has changed. Everything is the same. The only thing is that we are free, the war is over, we work without fearâ€”but apart from that, nothing has changed.
Halima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question. Let's see what the question is about.

The question refers to two passages. The first is from Olympe de Gouges' "Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen" in 1791. She's talking about women's rights, urging women to wake up and fight for their rights because they haven't benefited from the Revolution. She mentions scorn and disdain, so it seems like after the revolution, women's situation didn't improve as expected.

The second passage is from Halima Ghomri, interviewed in the 1970s after Algeria's independence. She says that independence didn't bring the changes she hoped for, like her children getting an education. They remain poor peasants, and nothing much has changed except freedom from war. So her main issue seems to be that social and economic progress didn't happen after independence.

The question is asking which factor is likeliest to have prevented the progress Halima hoped for. The options are from A to J.

So, I need to think about why independence didn't lead to the expected improvements. Halima mentions education not being achieved, so maybe lack of educational resources (option J) is a possible answer. But let's look at all options.

Option A: Hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites. That could be a factor if the new government didn't support women's rights. Olympe's speech is about women's rights not being addressed after a revolution, but Halima's issue seems broader, including education and poverty.

Option B: Inadequate healthcare facilities. That's a possibility, but Halima doesn't mention health specifically.

Option C: Corruption within the new government. Corruption could lead to resources being diverted, so that's a possible factor.

Option D: Prioritization of national liberation over social reform. This sounds relevant because after independence, the focus might have been on maintaining power or national issues rather than social reforms like education and poverty.

Option E: Resistance from foreign powers. Maybe, but Halima's statement doesn't mention external interference.

Option F: Lack of industrial assets or infrastructure. Infrastructure issues could hinder development, which affects education and economy.

Option G: Lack of support from the general population. If people didn't support the changes, that could be a problem, but Halima's situation seems more about leadership choices.

Option H: Failure to eradicate Islamic traditionalism. This could relate to social attitudes, but Halima's statement doesn't specifically point to this.

Option I: Economic instability. That's a big factor. If the country is economically unstable, it's hard to fund education and social programs.

Option J: Lack of educational resources. This directly ties to Halima's mention of her children not getting an education.

So, the question is what's the likeliest factor. Halima's main point is that after independence, nothing changed in terms of education and poverty. So, the new leaders might have focused more on national liberation and maintaining power rather than pushing through social reforms. So option D could be the answer.

Alternatively, it could be a lack of resources, like infrastructure or education resources. But the question is about which factor prevented the progress she hoped for. If the leaders didn't prioritize social reforms, that's a possible reason.

Wait, but Halima's situation is after independence, so the initial focus was on liberation. Once independence was achieved, maybe the new government didn't invest in social areas. So option D: Prioritization of national liberation over social reform. That makes sense because the leaders might have focused on consolidating their power or other national issues rather than addressing social needs.

So I think the answer is D.

The question asks which factor is likeliest to have prevented the progress Halima Ghomri hoped for after Algeria's independence. Halima's testimony indicates that despite independence, social and economic conditions remained unchanged, particularly in education and poverty. The most relevant factor is the prioritization of national liberation over social reform, as the new government may have focused on maintaining power or addressing national issues rather than implementing social reforms. 

Answer: D
