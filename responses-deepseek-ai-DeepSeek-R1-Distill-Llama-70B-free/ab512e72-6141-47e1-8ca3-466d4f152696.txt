Okay, so I've got this matrix multiplication question here, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let me think. Matrix A is 2x7 and matrix B is 7x5. I remember that when you multiply two matrices, the dimensions of the resulting matrix depend on the number of rows of the first matrix and the number of columns of the second matrix. 

Wait, right, the rule is that the number of columns of the first matrix has to match the number of rows of the second matrix for multiplication to be possible. So in this case, A has 7 columns and B has 7 rows. That means they can be multiplied. 

Now, the product matrix AB will have the same number of rows as A and the same number of columns as B. So A is 2 rows, B is 5 columns. So putting that together, AB should be 2x5. Let me double-check. 

A is 2x7, so when you multiply by B which is 7x5, the product AB's dimensions are (2 rows) x (5 columns). Yeah, that makes sense. So looking at the options, option F is 2x5. So the answer should be F.

The dimensions of the product matrix AB are determined by the number of rows in matrix A and the number of columns in matrix B. Here, matrix A has 2 rows and 7 columns, while matrix B has 7 rows and 5 columns. Since the number of columns in A matches the number of rows in B, the multiplication is possible. The resulting matrix AB will have 2 rows (from A) and 5 columns (from B), making its dimensions 2 × 5.

Option F corresponds to 2 × 5.
