Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about how long an egg can be fertilized after ovulation. Hmm, I remember from biology class that ovulation is when the egg is released from the ovary, right? And once it's released, it doesn't last forever. I think the egg has a limited time window where it can be fertilized by sperm.

Wait, I think the egg's viability for fertilization is around 24 hours. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. I remember that sperm can live inside the female reproductive tract for longer, like up to 5 days maybe. Oh, right, because sperm can survive in the cervix or uterus for several days, but the egg doesn't survive as long.

So if the egg is only viable for about a day after ovulation, then the fertilization has to happen within that 24-hour window. But I also heard that sometimes it can be a little longer, maybe up to 48 hours, but I'm not certain. Let me think again.

I remember reading that after ovulation, the egg travels through the fallopian tube and is viable for about 24 hours. So if sperm is present, it can fertilize the egg during that time. If it doesn't get fertilized, it will start to degrade and won't be viable anymore. 

Looking at the options, option D is 24 hours, which seems to fit what I remember. But wait, another thoughtâ€”some sources might say it's up to 48 hours. Oh wait, I think the exact time might be around 12-24 hours. But I'm more confident about the 24-hour mark being the commonly accepted answer.

So the options are A:48, B:6, C:36, D:24, G:12, etc. I think the correct answer is D, 24 hours. But wait, I also recall that sometimes the window is up to 48 hours. Did I mix up the numbers? Let me try to clarify.

Wait, I think the egg lives for about 12 to 24 hours. So the maximum time would be 24 hours. So the answer should be D:24 hours.

The egg remains viable for fertilization for approximately 12 to 24 hours after ovulation. While sperm can survive longer inside the female reproductive tract, the egg's window for fertilization is relatively short. Among the given options, 24 hours is the most widely accepted timeframe.

Answer: D
