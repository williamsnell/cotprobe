Okay, so I've got this problem about an eyepiece made of two thin lenses. Each lens has a 20 mm focal length, and they're separated by 16 mm. I need to find the equivalent focal length, the distance of the focal plane from the nearer lens, and the angular magnification. Hmm, I remember that eyepieces are usually designed to form a virtual image at infinity, which makes the angular magnification higher.

Wait, the eyepiece is made of two lenses: the field lens and the eyepiece lens, right? The first lens (field lens) is usually a converging lens, and the second is also converging. But wait, in some cases, like a Ramsden eyepiece, both are converging. I think that's the case here.

The formula for the equivalent focal length (f_e) of a two-lens eyepiece is 1/f_e = 1/f1 + 1/f2. But wait, no, that's for two lenses in contact. Oh right, when they're separated by some distance d, the formula is different. I recall that the equivalent focal length for two thin lenses separated by a distance d is 1/f_e = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - (d)/(f1*f2). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Maybe it's another formula. Wait, I think I'm confusing it with the formula for the combination of two lenses.

Wait, no, the general formula for two thin lenses separated by distance d is 1/f_e = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - d/(f1 f2). Or is it 1/f_e = (f1 f2)/(f1 + f2 - d)? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, maybe the formula is f_e = (f1 * f2) / (f1 + f2 - d), but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the eyepiece is designed so that the image formed by the first lens is at the focal point of the second lens. Oh right, because that way the eyepiece can produce a virtual image at infinity, which is desired for comfort during use. So for maximum magnification, the image formed by the field lens (first lens) should be at the focal point of the eyepiece lens (second lens).

So, let's model this. The object is placed at the focal point of the first lens (just beyond it). Wait, no, the object is placed just inside the focal point of the first lens so that the first lens produces a virtual image. Wait, no, actually, I think in an eyepiece, the field lens forms a real image just inside the focal point of the eyepiece lens, which then acts as a magnifier.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the positions using the thin lens formula. Let me try that.

For the first lens (f1 = 20 mm), the object is placed at a distance u1 from the lens. The image formed by the first lens will be at a distance v1. Then, that image becomes the object for the second lens, placed at a distance u2.

Wait, but the two lenses are separated by 16 mm. So the distance between them is d = 16 mm. So the first lens produces an image which is at a position v1 from the first lens. Then, that image is at a distance u2 from the second lens. So u2 = d - v1.

Wait, but wait: the first lens is lens 1, and the second is lens 2. So the distance from lens 1 to the image is v1, and the distance from lens 2 to that image would be d - v1, because the separation is d. So u2 = d - v1.

But for the eyepiece, the image from lens 1 is the object for lens 2. So the thin lens equation for each lens applies.

Let me denote f1 and f2 as the focal lengths, both 20 mm here. The separation is d=16 mm.

The object for the first lens is at u1 (we need to find where the object is placed so that the final image is at infinity, which gives maximum magnification). Wait, no, for an eyepiece, the design is such that the image formed by the first lens is at the focal point of the second lens. Because then, the second lens will form an image at infinity. So the image from lens 1 should be at the focal point of lens 2.

So, the image from lens 1 is at a distance v1 from lens 1. The distance between the lenses is d = 16 mm. So the image would be at a distance of (d - v1) from lens 2. But for lens 2, that image needs to be at its focal point. So for lens 2, the object distance u2 is equal to f2.

Wait, but the image from lens 1 is at the focal point of lens 2. So the image distance for lens 1 (v1) plus the separation d must be equal to the focal length of lens 2. Wait, no, because the image from lens 1 is on the same side as lens 2. So the distance from lens 1 to the image is v1, and the separation between lenses is d, so the distance from lens 2 to the image is d - v1. But since the image is at the focal point of lens 2, that distance must be equal to f2. So:

d - v1 = f2

So v1 = d - f2 = 16 mm - 20 mm = -4 mm.

Wait, that can't be right. Negative image distance would mean the image is on the same side as the object for lens 1. But the object for lens 1 is placed at a certain position, perhaps.

Wait, maybe I should think again. The image formed by lens 1 is at the focal point of lens 2. So for lens 2, the object is at its focal point, which would cause the image to be at infinity. So that's correct.

So, the image from lens 1 is located at a distance v1 from lens 1 such that the distance from lens 2 to this image is f2. So the separation between the lenses is 16 mm, so the distance from lens 1 to the image is v1, and from lens 2 to the image is (d - v1). But for lens 2, this should be equal to f2, so (d - v1) = f2.

Wait, but the image is on the opposite side of lens 2, so the object distance u2 for lens 2 would be (d - v1), which equals f2. So that makes the image from lens 1 located at v1 = d - f2 = 16 - 20 = -4 mm. So a negative image distance indicates it's a virtual image on the same side as the object.

So now, for lens 1, using the thin lens formula: 1/f1 = 1/u1 + 1/v1.

We have f1 = 20 mm, v1 = -4 mm.

So 1/20 = 1/u1 + 1/(-4).

Solving for u1:

1/u1 = 1/20 - 1/(-4) = 1/20 + 1/4 = (1 +5)/20 = 6/20 = 3/10.

So u1 = 10/3 ≈ 3.333 mm.

Wait, so the object is placed 3.333 mm in front of lens 1. That makes sense because it's inside the focal length of lens 1 (20 mm), so it produces a virtual image.

But wait, the object for the eyepiece is typically placed just inside the focal length of the field lens to produce a virtual image that's then magnified by the eyepiece lens. So this seems correct.

Now, with u1 known, I can find the focal length of the eyepiece combination.

The equivalent focal length of the eyepiece can be found using the formula: f_e = (f1 * f2) / (f1 + f2 - d).

Wait, let me double-check that formula. I think it's correct for two thin lenses in air separated by d. Let me plug in the numbers.

f1 = f2 = 20 mm, d=16 mm.

f_e = (20 * 20) / (20 +20 -16) = 400 / (24) ≈ 16.666... mm, which is approximately 16.67 mm.

So that's the equivalent focal length.

Next, part (b): the distance of the focal plane from the nearer lens. I think this refers to the location of the focal point of the eyepiece, which is the point where parallel rays entering the eyepiece converge. Since the eyepiece is being used to view objects placed at a certain distance, the focal plane is where the image would be formed when the object is at infinity.

Wait, but in our case, when the object is placed at u1 ≈3.333 mm, the image is formed at infinity by the eyepiece. But the focal plane is the location where the image would form when the object is at the focal point of the eyepiece. Alternatively, the focal plane is the location of the image when the object is at infinity.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The focal plane's position would be the image focal point when the object is at a certain position.

Wait, the focal length of the eyepiece is 16.67 mm, so the focal plane is 16.67 mm from the eyepiece's principal point. But the question is about the distance from the nearer lens. Wait, the eyepiece is made of two lenses. The principal point of the combination might be somewhere in between. Alternatively, perhaps the focal plane is measured from the second lens.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the position of the focal point. The focal point is where the image is formed when the object is at infinity. So, for the eyepiece, if the object is at infinity (so u1 approaches infinity), then the image formed by the first lens would be at its focal point. Wait, for lens 1, if u1 is very large, the image is at v1 ≈ f1 =20 mm. But in the eyepiece setup, the image formed by lens 1 is at the focal point of lens 2, which is at a certain position.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the position of the focal points in a two-lens system. Alternatively, perhaps the focal plane is determined by the location of the image when the object is at the focal point of the eyepiece.

Alternatively, perhaps the focal plane is the location where the image is formed when the object is placed at the focal point of the eyepiece. Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Let me think: the equivalent focal length is 16.67 mm. So the principal point is somewhere, but the focal plane is at a distance of f_e from the principal point. But without knowing the position of the principal point, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the focal plane is located at the image focal point, which is at a distance f_e from the second lens. Wait, but the second lens is the eyepiece lens. Hmm, maybe the focal plane is located near the second lens.

Wait, another approach: the distance from the second lens to the focal plane is called the 'eye relief', but that might not be exactly what's being asked here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the position of the focal point relative to the first lens.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the position of the focal point of the combined lens system relative to the first lens.

Wait, the focal length is 16.67 mm. So the focal point is 16.67 mm from the principal point of the system. But the principal point's location depends on the arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the focal plane is located at a distance i_2 from the second lens. Since when an object is placed at the focal point of the eyepiece, the image is at infinity, and when the object is at infinity, the image is at the focal point.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the image formed by the eyepiece when the object is at infinity. The eyepiece's focal length is 16.67 mm, so the image is at the focal plane, 16.67 mm behind the eyepiece. But how is this related to the two lenses?

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the system as a single lens with f_e =16.67 mm, and then the location of the focal plane would be measured from the second lens. Wait, but the two lenses are 16 mm apart, so perhaps the focal plane is located 3.33 mm from the second lens.

Wait, how? Let me think. Because the separation between the lenses is 16 mm, and the equivalent focal length is 16.67 mm, which is longer than the separation. So perhaps the focal point is beyond the second lens, but that doesn't make sense because the equivalent focal length is the distance from the principal point to the focal point.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the position of the principal points. For two thin lenses, the distance from the first lens to the first principal point (P1) is (f1 d)/(f1 + f2 - d). Similarly, the distance from the second lens to the second principal point (P2) is (f2 d)/(f1 + f2 -d).

Wait, let me compute that.

f1=20, f2=20, d=16.

So the distance from lens 1 to P1 is (20*16)/(20+20-16) )= (320)/(24)= 13.333 mm.

But wait, that's longer than the separation between the lenses, which is 16 mm. That can't be right. Hmm, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, I think I might have the formula wrong. Let me think again. The principal points' locations can be found using:

From lens 1 to P1: (f1 (f1 + f2 - d)) / (f1 + f2 - d) )? Hmm, maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the focal plane location. The focal plane is at a distance f_e from the principal point. But without knowing where the principal point is, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the focal plane is located at a distance i_2 from the second lens. Let's see, in the eyepiece setup, when the object is at the focal point of the eyepiece (u = -f_e), the image is at infinity. So the rays leave the eyepiece parallel, meaning they would converge at the focal plane, which is at f_e from the principal point.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the image position when the object is at infinity.

Wait, if the object is at infinity, the image formed by the eyepiece is at the focal point. So using the eyepiece as a single lens, the image distance would be f_e. But how does that relate to the individual lenses?

Wait, perhaps I should model the entire system as a single lens with f_e =16.67 mm. So the focal point is 16.67 mm from the principal point. But where is the principal point located relative to the two lenses?

Alternatively, perhaps the focal plane is located at a distance of i_2 = (f_e * f2) / (f1 + f2 - d) ) ?

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should find the image position when the object is at infinity for the combined system.

Wait, when the object is at infinity, the image is at the focal point of the eyepiece. So the image distance for the combined system is f_e =16.67 mm.

But since the eyepiece is made of two lenses, I need to find where this image is located relative to each lens.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the position of the image when the object is at infinity. So for the first lens, the object is at infinity, so the image is at f1 =20 mm from lens 1. Then, the separation between the lenses is 16 mm, so the image from lens 1 is at 20 mm on the other side. So the distance from lens 2 to this image is 20 mm -16 mm =4 mm. Wait, that's 4 mm in front of lens 2.

So for lens 2, the object is at u2 =4 mm. The focal length of lens 2 is 20 mm, so using the thin lens formula: 1/f2 = 1/u2 +1/v2.

So 1/20 =1/4 +1/v2 → 1/v2 = 1/20 -1/4 = (1 -5)/20 = -4/20 → v2= -5 mm.

So the image is at v2= -5 mm from lens 2, meaning 5 mm on the same side as the object (since it's negative). So the image is 5 mm in front of lens 2.

Wait, but wait: the separation is 16 mm, so the image from lens 1 is 4 mm in front of lens 2, and then lens 2 forms an image 5 mm behind itself, which is 16 +5=21 mm from lens 1.

Wait, no: because the image from lens 1 is 4 mm in front of lens 2, so when lens 2 forms an image 5 mm behind itself, that image is 5 mm behind lens 2, which is 16 mm +5 mm =21 mm from lens 1.

Wait, but the combined eyepiece's focal length is 16.67 mm, so the image should be at approximately 16.67 mm from the principal point. I'm getting a bit confused here.

But wait, the problem is asking for the distance of the focal plane from the nearer lens. If the focal plane is 5 mm behind lens 2, then from lens 1, it's 16 mm +5 mm=21 mm. But I don't see 21 mm as an option. The options have things like 3.33 mm or 4.00 mm, etc.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Let me try another way.

Wait, part (b) is the distance of the focal plane from the nearer lens. So the nearer lens is lens 1, so the focal plane is 16.67 mm from the principal point of the eyepiece. But where is that principal point located?

Wait, perhaps I can find the principal point locations. The formula for the position of the first principal point P1 relative to lens 1 is (f1 (f1 + f2 - d)) / (f1 +f2).

Wait, no, perhaps another formula. Let me think: for two lenses, the principal points can be found by:

distance from lens 1 to P1: (f1 * d)/(f1 +f2)

Wait, that
