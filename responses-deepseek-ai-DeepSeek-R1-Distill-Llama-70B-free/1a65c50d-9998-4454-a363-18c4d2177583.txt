Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, we have two numbers that add up to 19, and their product is 70. I need to find out which pair of numbers from the options satisfies both conditions.

Hmm, let's think about this step by step. First, I'll denote the two numbers as x and y. So, according to the problem, x + y = 19, and x * y = 70.

Wait, maybe I can use these two equations to solve for x and y. Since x + y =19, I can express y as 19 - x. Then substitute that into the product equation: x*(19 - x) =70.

Expanding that, I get 19x - x² =70. Rearranging the terms, it becomes x² -19x +70=0. Oh wait, that's a quadratic equation. Maybe I can solve it using the quadratic formula.

The quadratic equation is ax² + bx + c =0, so here a=1, b=-19, c=70. The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)]/(2a). Plugging the values in: x = [19 ± sqrt(361 - 280)]/2. Because 19 squared is 361, and 4ac is 4*1*70=280. So sqrt(361-280)=sqrt(81)=9.

So the solutions are (19 +9)/2 =28/2=14 and (19-9)/2=10/2=5. So the two numbers are 14 and 5. Let me check the options to see which one matches.

Looking at the options, option A is 5 and 14. That fits. Let me double-check: 5 +14 is 19, and 5*14 is 70. Yep, that's correct.

Wait, but let me make sure there's no other pair that also fits. Let's go through the options quickly. Option H is 7 and 10. 7+10=17, which is less than 19. Their product is 70, but the sum is wrong. So no. Option D is 9 and10, sum is 19, but product is 90, which is too high. So no. Option E is 12 and7, sum 19? 12+7=19, yes. Product is 84, which isn't 70. So no. Option I: 8+11=19, product 88, nope. Option B:4+15=19, product 60, not 70. So yes, only option A fits both conditions.
</think>

The two numbers are 5 and 14. They satisfy both conditions: their sum is 19 (5 + 14 = 19) and their product is 70 (5 × 14 = 70). Among the given options, only option A matches these values.

Answer: A
