Okay, so I've got this probability problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because order statistics can be a bit tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a random sample of size n=6 from a continuous distribution. The order statistics are Y1 < Y2 < Y3 < Y4 < Y5 < Y6. We need to compute P(Y2 < π0.5 < Y5). Hmm, π0.5 is the 50th percentile of the distribution. So, we're looking for the probability that the second order statistic is less than the median (since 50th percentile is the median) of the distribution, and that the median is less than the fifth order statistic.

Wait, I remember that in order statistics, each Y_i represents the ith smallest value in the sample. So Y2 is the second smallest, Y5 is the fifth smallest. So we're trying to find the probability that the median of the distribution lies between the second and fifth smallest observations in the sample.

I think for continuous distributions, the probability can be calculated using the properties of order statistics. Each Y_i has a beta distribution, I believe. The probability that a particular order statistic is less than a certain value involves integrating the distribution function, but maybe there's a combinatorial way to approach this.

Wait, another thought: the event Y2 < π0.5 < Y5 means that in the sample of 6, at least 2 of them are less than π0.5 (since Y2 is less than π0.5, so the first two are). Also, at least 4 of them are less than π0.5 because Y5 is greater than π0.5, so the first five can't all be less than π0.5. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

Actually, if Y2 < π0.5, that means at least two of the six observations are less than π0.5. Because Y2 is the second smallest; if it's less than π0.5, then both Y1 and Y2 are less than π0.5. Similarly, if Y5 is greater than π0.5, that means that at least five of the observations are greater than π0.5, because Y5 is the fifth smallest, so Y5, Y6 are greater than π0.5.

Wait, no, wait. If Y5 > π0.5, that means that the fifth and sixth order statistics are above π0.5. So in the sample, only the first four can be below or equal to π0.5. So how does that affect the count?

Let me think again. The event Y2 < π0.5 < Y5 implies that among the six observations, at least two are less than π0.5 (since Y2 is the second smallest and is less than π0.5), and at least two are greater than π0.5 (since Y5 is the fifth smallest and greater than π0.5). So in total, in the sample, there are 2 ≤ k ≤ 4 observations less than π0.5, where k is the number of observations less than π0.5.

Wait, no, because if Y5 is greater than π0.5, that means that the fifth and sixth are greater, so the first four could be less than or equal to π0.5. But since Y2 is less than π0.5, that means at least two are less. So the number of observations less than π0.5 is at least 2 and at most 4.

So the number of X_i less than π0.5 can be 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, the probability we're seeking is the sum of the probabilities that exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 of the six observations are less than π0.5.

Since the distribution is continuous, the probability that any X_i equals π0.5 is zero, so we can ignore that.

So the problem reduces to calculating the sum of binomial probabilities for k=2,3,4, with n=6 trials and success probability p=0.5 (since π0.5 is the median, the probability that any single observation is less than π0.5 is 0.5).

Wait, because for a continuous distribution, P(X < π_p) = p. So here, P(X < π0.5) = 0.5.

So the probability mass function for a binomial distribution is C(n, k) * (0.5)^k * (0.5)^{n−k} = C(6, k) * (0.5)^6.

So the sum is [C(6,2) + C(6,3) + C(6,4)] * (0.5)^6.

Calculating each term:

C(6,2) = 15

C(6,3) = 20

C(6,4) = 15 (since C(6,4) = C(6,2) due to symmetry)

Adding them up: 15 + 20 +15 = 50.

So the sum is 50 * (1/64) = 50/64 = 25/32 ≈ 0.78125.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.7812, which matches this value. So the answer should be J.

To solve the problem, we need to compute \( P(Y_2 < \pi_{0.5} < Y_5) \), where \( Y_1 < Y_2 < Y_3 < Y_4 < Y_5 < Y_6 \) are the order statistics of a random sample of size \( n = 6 \) from a continuous distribution. Here, \( \pi_{0.5} \) represents the 50th percentile (median) of the distribution.

The event \( Y_2 < \pi_{0.5} < Y_5 \) implies that at least 2 of the 6 observations are less than \( \pi_{0.5} \) (since \( Y_2 < \pi_{0.5} \)), and at least 2 of the 6 observations are greater than \( \pi_{0.5} \) (since \( Y_5 > \pi_{0.5} \)). Therefore, the number of observations less than \( \pi_{0.5} \) must be 2, 3, or 4.

Since the distribution is continuous, the probability that any observation equals \( \pi_{0.5} \) is zero. Thus, we can model the number of observations less than \( \pi_{0.5} \) using a binomial distribution with parameters \( n = 6 \) and \( p = 0.5 \), where \( p \) is the probability that a single observation is less than \( \pi_{0.5} \).

The probability mass function for the binomial distribution is:

\[
P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k},
\]

where \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient. For \( k = 2, 3, 4 \), we calculate:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = 15, \quad \binom{6}{3} = 20, \quad \binom{6}{4} = 15.
\]

The total probability is:

\[
P(Y_2 < \pi_{0.5} < Y_5) = \left( \binom{6}{2} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{4} \right) (0.5)^6.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(Y_2 < \pi_{0.5} < Y_5) = (15 + 20 + 15) \cdot (0.5)^6 = 50 \cdot \frac{1}{64} = \frac{50}{64} = \frac{25}{32} \approx 0.78125.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the closest match is **J: 0.7812**.
