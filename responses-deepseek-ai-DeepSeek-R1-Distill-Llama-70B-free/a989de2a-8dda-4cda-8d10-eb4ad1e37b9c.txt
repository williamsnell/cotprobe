Okay, so I've got this problem here about converting van der Waals parameters into SI base units. The question gives me the value of b as 0.0226 dm³/mol⁻¹ and asks me to express it in SI base units. The options are from A to I.

Hmm, I remember that SI base units are the standard units for each measurement. In this case, the unit given is cubic decimeters per mole. I know that SI uses meters, kilograms, seconds, etc. So I need to convert cubic decimeters to cubic meters because meters are the base unit for length.

Wait, what's the relationship between a decimeter and a meter? Oh right, 1 decimeter is 0.1 meters. So 1 dm is 10^-1 m. But since the unit here is cubic, I have to cube that conversion factor.

So 1 dm³ equals (0.1 m)^3. Let me calculate that. 0.1 cubed is 0.001, which is 1e-3. So 1 dm³ = 1e-3 m³.

Now, the original value is 0.0226 dm³/mol⁻¹. To convert this to m³, I multiply by the conversion factor. So 0.0226 dm³ * (1e-3 m³ / 1 dm³) = ?

Calculating that: 0.0226 * 1e-3 = 2.26e-5 m³/mol⁻¹. Wait, let me double-check that math. 0.0226 is 2.26 x 10^-2. Multiply that by 1e-3, which is 10^-3. So 10^-2 * 10^-3 = 10^-5. So 2.26e-5 m³/mol⁻¹.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this. Let me scan through them.

Option G is 2.26e-5 m³/mol⁻¹. That matches my calculation. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, another way to think about it: 1 dm³ is a liter, right? And 1 m³ is 1000 liters. So 0.0226 dm³ is 22.6 liters (because 0.0226 * 1000 = 22.6). But wait, no, wait. No, wait, 1 dm³ is a liter, so 0.0226 dm³ is 0.0226 liters. To convert liters to m³, since 1 m³ is 1000 liters, 0.0226 liters is 0.0226 / 1000 = 2.26e-5 m³. Oh yeah, that's the same result. So I'm confident that option G is correct.

To convert the van der Waals parameter $b = 0.0226 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ into SI base units, we need to express the volume in terms of $\mathrm{m}^3$. 

1. **Conversion factor**: Since $1 \, \mathrm{dm} = 0.1 \, \mathrm{m}$, $1 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 = (0.1 \, \mathrm{m})^3 = 1 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{m}^3$.
2. **Conversion of $b$**: Multiply the given value by the conversion factor:
   \[
   b = 0.0226 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1} \times 1 \times 10^{-3} \, \mathrm{m}^3 \, \mathrm{dm}^{-3} = 2.26 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{m}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1}.
   \]
3. **Verification**: Another way to verify is to note that $1 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 = 1 \, \mathrm{L}$, and $1 \, \mathrm{m}^3 = 1000 \, \mathrm{L}$. Thus, $0.0226 \, \mathrm{L}$ is equivalent to:
   \[
   b = \frac{0.0226}{1000} = 2.26 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{m}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1}.
   \]

From the options provided, the correct answer is **G: $2.26 \times 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{m}^3 \, \mathrm{mol}^{-1}$**.
