Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the largest factor of 54,321 that's less than 54,321 itself. The options are given from A to J. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.

First off, I remember that a factor of a number is another number that divides into it without leaving a remainder. So the largest factor of any number, other than the number itself, would be the next biggest divisor. But wait, the number itself is excluded here because the question asks for a factor less than 54,321.

So the task is to find the largest proper factor of 54,321. Now, how do I approach this? I think the best way is to factorize 54,321 into its prime factors because once I have them, I can find all the possible factors.

Let me start by checking if 54,321 is divisible by some small primes. I'll start with 2, but wait, 54,321 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2. Next, let's check 3. The sum of the digits is 5+4+3+2+1 = 15. 15 is divisible by 3, so yes, 54,321 ÷ 3 should give an integer.

Dividing 54,321 by 3: 3 goes into 5 once (3), remainder 2. Bring down 4 to make 24. 3 into 24 is 8 times. Bring down 3 to make 3. 3 goes once. Bring down 2 to make 23. 3 into 23 is 7 times (21), remainder 2. Bring down 1 to make 21. 3 into 21 is 7. So putting it all together, 54,321 ÷ 3 is 18,107. So 3 × 18,107 = 54,321.

Now, I need to check if 18,107 is a prime number or if it can be factored further. Let's test for divisibility by some primes. 

Is 18,107 divisible by 2? No, it's odd. How about 3? The sum of its digits is 1+8+1+0+7 = 17. 17 isn't divisible by 3, so no. Next, 5: it doesn't end with 0 or 5, so no.

Let me try 7: 7 × 2587 is 18,109, which is a bit more than 18,107, so no. Alternatively, let's do 18,107 ÷ 7. 7 × 2587 is 18,109, which is 2 more than 18,107, so remainder is -2, so no.

How about 11? The rule for 11 is alternating sum. (1 - 8 + 1 - 0 +7) = 1 -8 is -7, +1 is -6, -0 is still -6, +7 is 1. Since 1 isn't divisible by 11, 18,107 isn't divisible by 11.

Next prime is 13. Let's see, 13 × 1393 is 18,109 again, which is higher than 18,107, so 13 × 1392 is 18,096. 18,107 -18,096=11. So no, remainder 11.

Next is 17. Let me see, 17 × 1065 is 18,105. 18,107 -18,105=2, so remainder 2. Not divisible by 17.

Next prime: 19. Let's compute 19 × 953. Let's see, 19 × 900=17,100. 19 × 53 is 1007. So 17,100 + 1007=18,107. Oh wait, that adds up perfectly! So 19 × 953 equals 18,107. That means 18,107 is 19 × 953. So now, breaking down 54,321, we have 3 × 19 × 953.

Wait, is 953 a prime? I should check that. Let's see, to test if 953 is prime, I can check divisibility up to sqrt(953), which is approximately 30.89. So I need to check primes up to 31.

I'll check 2: no, it's odd. 3: 9+5+3=17, not divisible by 3. 5: doesn't end with 0 or 5. 7: 7×136=952, 952+1=953, so 953 ÷7 is 136 with a remainder of 1, so no. 11: Alternating sum: 9 -5 +3 =7, not divisible by 11. 13: 13×73=949. 949 +13=962, which is higher. 953-949=4, so no. 17: 17×56=952. So 953-952=1, so remainder 1, not divisible. 19: 19×50=950, 950+19=969, higher. 953-950=3, so no. 23: 23×41=943, 943+23=966, so no. 29: 29×32=928, 928+29=957, which is higher. 953-928=25, which isn't a multiple of 29. 31: 31×30=930, 930+31=961, which is higher. 953-930=23, not a multiple.

So 953 is a prime number. Therefore, the prime factors of 54,321 are 3 × 19 × 953.

Now, to find the largest factor less than 54,321. So the proper factors are all the factors except 1 and 54,321. The largest proper factor would be the number divided by its smallest prime factor. Because when you divide by the smallest prime, you get the largest co-factor.

The smallest prime factor here is 3. So 54,321 ÷3 = 18,107. Which is option C. Let me check the options: option C is 18107. So that's the largest factor less than 54,321.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think again. Are there any larger factors than 18,107? Because 18,107 is a factor, but perhaps 54,321 could have a larger factor, like maybe 54,321 divided by a smaller prime? Wait, the smallest prime is 3, so 54,321 ÷3 is 18,107. But what about other combinations? Let me list the factors.

The prime factors are 3, 19, 953. So the factors are:

1,
3,
19,
953,
3×19=57,
3×953=2869,
19×953=18107,
and 3×19×953=54321.

So the factors in order are: 1, 3, 19, 57, 953, 2869, 18107, 54321.

So the largest factor less than 54,321 is 18,107, which is option C.

Looking back at the options: option C is 18107, which matches. So the answer should be C.

To determine the largest factor of 54,321 that is less than 54,321, we start by factorizing the number. 

First, we check divisibility by small primes. Since the sum of the digits of 54,321 is 15, which is divisible by 3, we divide 54,321 by 3:

\[
54,321 \div 3 = 18,107
\]

Next, we factorize 18,107. Testing for divisibility by primes, we find:

\[
18,107 = 19 \times 953
\]

Finally, we check if 953 is a prime number by testing divisibility up to its square root (~30.89). Since 953 is not divisible by any primes up to 31, it is confirmed to be prime. Thus, the prime factorization of 54,321 is:

\[
54,321 = 3 \times 19 \times 953
\]

The factors of 54,321 are: 1, 3, 19, 57, 953, 2869, 18,107, and 54,321. The largest factor less than 54,321 is 18,107. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: 18,107**
