Question:

A state legislature passed a law requiring state universities to have male and female students live in separate dormitory facilities. The law was passed in order to curtail the increasing number of co-ed pregnancies on college campuses. Two students at a state university are engaged to be married and wish to share a dormitory room together. Citing the law, university housing officials refuse to allow them to live together in a campus dormitory facility. The students bring an appropriate action to challenge the constitutionality of the law. Which of the following correctly states the applicable burden of persuasion?

Options:

A: Since the law does not affect a fundamental right or involve gender discrimination, the burden is on the plaintiffs to show that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.
B: Since the law deals with the fundamental right of privacy, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.
C: Since the law involves marital discrimination, the state must prove that the law is substantially related to an important state interest.
D: Since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.
E: Since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must prove that the law is substantially related to an important state interest.
F: Since the law deals with the freedom of association, the burden is on the plaintiffs to prove that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.
G: Since the law deals with the freedom of association, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.
H: Since the law involves privacy rights, the burden is on the plaintiffs to prove that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.
I: Since the law affects the fundamental right to education, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest.
J: Since the law does not affect a fundamental right or involve marital discrimination, the burden is on the plaintiffs to show that it is not rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this constitutional law question about the burden of persuasion in a case where a state law is being challenged. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a state legislature passed a law requiring universities to have separate dorms for male and female students. The reason given is to reduce co-ed pregnancies. Two engaged students want to live together, but the university refuses based on the law. They're challenging the law's constitutionality.

The question is about the burden of persuasion. So, I need to remember the different standards of scrutiny in constitutional law. The main levels are rational basis, intermediate scrutiny, and strict scrutiny.

First, I should identify what kind of right is at play here. The students are engaged and want to live together. That seems to touch on privacy rights, maybe even the right to marry and make personal decisions about living arrangements. The Supreme Court has recognized that marriage and personal relationships are part of the fundamental right of privacy. For example, in cases like Griswold v. Connecticut, where the court held that the right to privacy includes the use of contraceptives, and in Eisenstadt v. Baird, extending that to unmarried couples.

So, if the right to privacy is a fundamental right, then the state law would be subject to strict scrutiny. That means the state must show that the law furthers a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.

But wait, let me think again. The law here is about separating dorms by gender. Is the issue here gender discrimination, or is it more about privacy or another right? The law applies to all students, regardless of gender, but it's separating based on gender. So, it's a gender-based classification.

Wait, but the students are a male and female engaged couple. They're being prevented from living together because of their genders, even though they're engaged. So, does this implicate gender discrimination, or is it more about privacy and the right to marry?

Hmm. Another angle: the law could be seen as affecting the fundamental right to marry. The right to marry is a fundamental right under the Due Process Clause, as established in cases like Loving v. Virginia. So if the law is interfering with that right, then strict scrutiny would apply.

Alternatively, the law's basis is gender, so it might trigger intermediate scrutiny. Because gender is a quasi-suspect classification. But wait, in this case, the students are challenging the law because it's preventing them from living together despite being engaged. So, it's not just about gender but also about their marital status and privacy.

Wait, maybe the law is a gender classification because it's separating housing based on gender. So, does that mean that the law is subject to intermediate scrutiny? Because for gender discrimination, the court uses intermediate scrutiny, which requires the law to be substantially related to an important governmental interest.

But then again, if the law is also impinging on a fundamental right like privacy or marriage, then strict scrutiny applies regardless of the classification. So which applies here?

I think the key here is whether the law affects a fundamental right. If it does, then strict scrutiny is used. If not, then the level of scrutiny depends on the classification.

In this case, the students are engaged, so they have a right to marry and make decisions about their living arrangements. So the law is burdening their fundamental right to privacy and marriage. So, the state would need to meet strict scrutiny.

Alternatively, the law could be seen as gender-based, which uses intermediate scrutiny. But I think the more direct issue here is the fundamental right to privacy and marriage. So, the state would have the burden to show a compelling interest.

Wait, but the options given may not all align with that. Let me look at the options.

Option B says since the law deals with the fundamental right of privacy, the state must show a compelling interest. That sounds like strict scrutiny.

Option D says since the law involves gender discrimination, the state must show a compelling interest. But gender discrimination uses intermediate scrutiny, which requires the law to be substantially related to an important interest, not compelling.

Option E says gender discrimination, so the state must prove it's substantially related to an important interest. That's correct for gender, but if the right is fundamental, strict applies.

So, if the law impinges on a fundamental right, strict scrutiny applies, regardless of the classification. So, in this case, the burden would be on the state to show a compelling interest.

So, looking at the options, option B states that because the law deals with the fundamental right of privacy, the state must show a compelling interest. That seems correct.

Wait, but another thought: the law is about housing based on gender. So, perhaps the primary issue is gender discrimination. But the students are challenging it because they're engaged and can't live together. So, it's both a privacy issue and a gender issue.

If the court finds that the law infringes on the fundamental right to privacy or marriage, then strict scrutiny applies. So the state must meet a higher burden.

So, the applicable standard would be strict scrutiny. Therefore, the correct answer would be option B.

But let me make sure. Another angle: the law doesn't directly prohibit marriage, but it's a housing restriction. But the students are engaged and presumably of legal age to marry. So the state's action is burdening their ability to live together as a married couple, which is part of the fundamental right to marriage.

So yes, strict scrutiny applies. Therefore, the state must show a compelling interest, which is option B.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of a state law requiring separate dormitory facilities for male and female students at state universities. The law aims to reduce co-ed pregnancies, but two engaged students challenge it, arguing it prevents them from living together. The issue centers on the burden of persuasion and the applicable constitutional standard.

To determine the correct standard, it is essential to identify the rights at play. The students' desire to live together as an engaged couple implicates the fundamental right to privacy and the right to marry, both of which are protected under the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court has consistently recognized these as fundamental rights, as seen in cases like *Griswold v. Connecticut* and *Loving v. Virginia*. When a law burdens a fundamental right, strict scrutiny applies, requiring the state to demonstrate that the law furthers a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.

While the law also involves gender-based classification, the more direct issue is the infringement on the fundamental right to privacy and marriage. Therefore, strict scrutiny is the appropriate standard, not intermediate scrutiny, which would apply if the primary issue were gender discrimination.

Among the options provided, Option B correctly states that since the law deals with the fundamental right of privacy, the state must show that it furthers a compelling state interest. This aligns with the strict scrutiny standard required when fundamental rights are at stake.
