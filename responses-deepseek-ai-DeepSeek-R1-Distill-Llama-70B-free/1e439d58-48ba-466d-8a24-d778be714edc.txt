Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to approximate the area under the curve y=2^x from x=-1 to x=3 using the trapezoidal rule with n=4 subintervals. Hmm, I remember the trapezoidal rule is a method to estimate the integral when you can't solve it exactly. Let me think about how to apply it here.

First, I need to figure out the width of each subinterval, which is called h. Since n=4, I'll divide the interval from -1 to 3 into four equal parts. The total width of the interval is 3 - (-1) = 4. So each subinterval should have a width of h = 4/4 = 1. That makes sense because 4 subintervals each of width 1 will cover the entire interval.

Next, I need to find the x-values where the function will be evaluated. Starting at x=-1, each step increases by h=1. So the points are x₀ = -1, x₁ = 0, x₂ = 1, x₃ = 2, and x₄ = 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, because n=4 subintervals would have 5 points, right? From x₀ to x₄. Let me double-check that: for n=4, the number of points is n+1. So yes, x goes from -1, 0, 1, 2, 3.

Now, I need to evaluate the function y=2^x at each of these x points. Let's calculate each y value:

- At x₀ = -1: 2^(-1) = 1/(2^1) = 0.5
- At x₁ = 0: 2^0 = 1
- At x₂ = 1: 2^1 = 2
- At x₃ = 2: 2^2 = 4
- At x₄ = 3: 2^3 = 8

So the y values are [0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8].

The trapezoidal rule formula for n subintervals is (h/2) * [f(x₀) + 2f(x₁) + 2f(x₂) + ... + 2f(x_{n-1}) + f(xₙ})]. So for n=4, that's (h/2) multiplied by the sum of the first and last y values plus twice the sum of the middle y values.

Let me compute the sum inside:

Sum = f(x₀) + 2*(f(x₁) + f(x₂) + f(x₃)) + f(x₄)
= 0.5 + 2*(1 + 2 + 4) + 8
Wait, let's compute step by step:

First, 2*(1 + 2 +4) = 2*(7) = 14.

Then add 0.5 and 8: 0.5 +14 +8 = 22.5.

Now multiply by h/2, which is 1/2. So 22.5 * 0.5 = 11.25.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 11.25. So is that the answer? But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistake.

Let me recompute the sum.

f(x₀) is 0.5. f(x₁)=1, f(x₂)=2, f(x₃)=4, f(x₄)=8.

So the formula is (1/2) * [0.5 + 2*(1 + 2 +4) +8].

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for n=4 would be h/2 times [f(x₀) + 2f(x₁) + 2f(x₂) + 2f(x₃) + f(x₄)].

So plugging the numbers: [0.5 + 2*(1) + 2*(2) + 2*(4) +8] = 0.5 + 2 +4 +8 +8?

Wait, no, let me compute the terms correctly.

Wait, f(x₀)=0.5, f(x₁)=1, f(x₂)=2, f(x₃)=4, f(x₄)=8.

So the sum inside is 0.5 + 2*(1) + 2*(2) + 2*(4) +8.

Compute each term:

0.5 + (2*1)=2 + (2*2)=4 + (2*4)=8 +8.

Wait, wait, no, the sum is 0.5 + 2*(1 + 2 +4) +8. Let me compute 1+2+4=7. Multiply by 2 gives 14. Add 0.5 and 8: 0.5 +14=14.5, plus 8 is 22.5.

Then (1/2)*22.5 = 11.25. So yes, the approximate area is 11.25.

Looking at the options, option C is 11.25. So the answer should be C.

To approximate the area under the curve \( y = 2^x \) between \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 3 \) using the trapezoidal rule with \( n = 4 \) subintervals, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the width of each subinterval**:  
   The total interval is \( [ -1, 3 ] \), so the width is \( 3 - (-1) = 4 \). With \( n = 4 \), the width of each subinterval is:  
   \[
   h = \frac{4}{4} = 1
   \]

2. **Identify the points where the function is evaluated**:  
   Starting at \( x = -1 \), the points are:  
   \[
   x_0 = -1, \, x_1 = 0, \, x_2 = 1, \, x_3 = 2, \, x_4 = 3
   \]

3. **Evaluate the function at these points**:  
   \[
   f(x_0) = 2^{-1} = 0.5, \, f(x_1) = 2^0 = 1, \, f(x_2) = 2^1 = 2, \, f(x_3) = 2^2 = 4, \, f(x_4) = 2^3 = 8
   \]

4. **Apply the trapezoidal rule formula**:  
   The trapezoidal rule for \( n = 4 \) is:  
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{h}{2} \left[ f(x_0) + 2f(x_1) + 2f(x_2) + 2f(x_3) + f(x_4) \right]
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 0.5 + 2(1) + 2(2) + 2(4) + 8 \right]
   \]  
   Compute the sum inside:  
   \[
   0.5 + 2(1) + 2(2) + 2(4) + 8 = 0.5 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 8 = 22.5
   \]  
   Multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \):  
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 22.5 = 11.25
   \]

5. **Match the result to the closest option**:  
   The calculated area is \( 11.25 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
