Question:

The Latino American Party was founded and chartered in a state to promote the political power of Latino Americans. Members pledged themselves to vote only for candidates nominated by the party. At first, membership was open to any voter who pledged himself to those tenets, but after the defeats in a recent election, the Party expelled all nonLatino members upon the grounds that experience showed that only Latinos could be trusted to honor the obligation to vote only for the Party's nominees. Membership is currently confined to Latinos. In every election since, the Party's nominees have easily won election in their Congressional District. Subsequently, the Executive Committee proposes that the Party choose its own Latino candidate for governor of New Mexico in the upcoming election. It will put its slate for U. S. representatives, governor, and U. S. senator before Party members for mail ballot, along with any rival candidates who qualify for the poil. In an action by non-Latino citizens in the relevantCongressional District to enjoin the Latino AmericanParty from conducting the mail ballot primary, thefederal court will most likely

Options:

A: deny relief, because the Party's primary would be private action and not subject to restriction under the Constitution.
B: grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Thirteenth Amendment.
C: deny relief, because a pre-primary election is not within the scope of federal election control.
D: grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Seventeenth Amendment.
E: grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the Fifteenth Amendment.
F: grant relief, because the primary would be proscribed by the First Amendment.
G: deny relief, because the primary would be upheld by the Nineteenth Amendment.
H: deny relief, because the political party has the right to choose its own members.
I: deny relief, because the primary would be upheld by the Tenth Amendment.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this constitutional law question. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand the scenario.

So, there's this Latino American Party that was founded to promote the political power of Latino Americans. Initially, they allowed any voter who pledged to vote only for their candidates to join. But after some election defeats, they decided to expel all non-Latino members, reasoning that only Latinos could be trusted to stick to the party's nominees. Now, membership is only for Latinos.

In every election since, their nominees have been winning easily in their Congressional District. Now, the Party's Executive Committee wants to choose a Latino candidate for governor of New Mexico and other positions. They'll send out mail ballots to members with their slate and any rival candidates who qualify.

Some non-Latino citizens are suing to stop the Party from conducting this mail ballot primary. The question is whether the federal court will grant relief or deny it, and under which constitutional amendment or reasoning.

Hmm. So the issue seems to revolve around the legality of a political party restricting its membership and primary elections based on race or ethnicity. I remember that the Constitution, particularly the Fifteenth Amendment, deals with voting rights and prohibits discrimination based on race.

Wait, the Fifteenth Amendment says that the right to vote cannot be denied on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. But does that apply to political parties' primaries?

I recall the Supreme Court case of Smith v. Allwright, which dealt with the Democratic Party's primary in Texas being restricted to whites. The Court held that excluding African Americans from primaries was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment because the primary was effectively part of the state's election process. But that was a state-run primary, right?

In this question, is the primary a state-run or a private party affair? The Party is conducting a mail ballot primary themselves, not using state resources. So does that make it a private action, or is it still subject to constitutional restrictions?

Another point is the case of California Democratic Party v. Jones (2000), where the Supreme Court held that a state could not force political parties to open their primaries to all voters, but also that parties have the First Amendment right to limit their membership and primaries. Wait, but that case involved a state law requiring open primaries, and the Court said it infringed on the party's associational rights under the First Amendment.

So in this case, the party is restricting its membership to Latinos, and thus the primary is only open to them. The non-Latino citizens are challenging this exclusion.

So the question is whether the federal court would allow this exclusion. If the primary is considered a private party affair, then maybe the Fifteenth Amendment doesn't apply. But if it's seen as an integral part of the election process, then it might.

Wait, but in Smith v. Allwright, the primary was state-run, so it was considered state action. Here, the party is conducting its own primary without state involvement. So perhaps it's private and thus not subject to the same constitutional restrictions.

But then again, the Fourteenth Amendment applies to state action, not private individuals. So if the party's actions aren't state action, then the Constitution wouldn't apply. But I'm not sure if a primary, even a private one, could be considered state action if it's effectively determining the election outcome. But in this case, the primary is just for the party's nominees; the general election is still open to all candidates.

Wait, but the question states that in every election since the membership restriction, the Party's nominees have easily won. So maybe the primary determines the general election outcome because the party's candidate is certain to win. Does that make the primary a state action?

Alternatively, maybe the court would view the primary as a private function because it's conducted by the party without state involvement, so the party can set its own membership rules. Therefore, the exclusion of non-Latino members wouldn't violate the Fifteenth Amendment because it's not state action.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The Fifteenth Amendment prohibits the United States and the states from denying voting rights based on race. So if the party's primary is a private event, then the Amendment doesn't apply. But if the primary is considered an integral part of the state's election process, then it would be subject to constitutional constraints.

In this case, the party is sending out mail ballots, but it's their own primary. They're not using state resources or state law to conduct it. So it's a private primary. Therefore, the exclusion wouldn't be a state action, so the Fifteenth Amendment wouldn't apply. Thus, the court would deny relief, meaning the party can continue their primary as is.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the primary is a private action, not subject to constitutional restriction. That would mean the court denies relief. Option E is about the Fifteenth Amendment proscribing the primary, which would mean relief is granted. But if the primary is private, then E wouldn't apply.

So the correct answer would be A or H. Option H says the party has the right to choose its own members. That's based on the First Amendment's associational rights, as in California Democratic Party v. Jones.

Wait, in that case, the Supreme Court said that parties have the right to set their own membership rules, including in primaries. So the party excluding non-Latino members would be within their rights under the First Amendment. So the court would deny relief because the party has the right to choose its members.

So the options are A and H. H says the court would deny relief because the party can choose its own members, which aligns with the First Amendment associational rights.

Alternatively, A says it's a private action not subject to the Constitution. But the party's action could still be subject to the Constitution if it's considered state action. But I think it's private here.

Wait, the question is about a mail ballot primary. If it's entirely private, then it's not state action, so the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments don't apply. Thus, the court would deny relief because it's a private primary (Option A). But H is about the party's right to choose members, which is a different reasoning.

So which is it? The correct reasoning would be that the party's primary is a private action, so the Constitution doesn't apply. Or that the party has the associational right to choose its members.

I think the Supreme Court in Jones case held that parties have the First Amendment right to decide their own membership and primary rules, so the state can't force them to open up. So in this case, the party's restriction is allowed under the First Amendment. So the court would deny the injunction because the party has the right to choose its own members, so option H.

Wait, but the Fifteenth Amendment issue is about racial discrimination. But if the party's action isn't state action, then the Fifteenth Amendment isn't violated. So the court would deny relief because the party's primary is a private matter, not subject to constitutional restrictions on race.

But if the party is a private organization, then they can discriminate based on race in membership, unless a specific law prohibits it. But the question is about constitutional issues, not statutory. So under the Constitution, private clubs can discriminate unless it's a public accommodation, which political parties might not be considered as such.

Alternatively, the Supreme Court has ruled that political parties do have First Amendment rights to associate and set their membership criteria. So in this case, the party's restriction is permissible under the First Amendment, so the court would deny the injunction.

Looking back at the options, option H says, "deny relief, because the political party has the right to choose its own members." That would be the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether a federal court will grant relief to non-Latino citizens seeking to enjoin the Latino American Party from conducting a mail ballot primary restricted to Latino members. The key issue is whether the party's exclusion of non-Latino members violates constitutional protections, particularly under the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting rights.

The Fifteenth Amendment applies to state action, not private entities. In this case, the Latino American Party is conducting its own primary as a private event, without state involvement or resources. This distinguishes it from cases like *Smith v. Allwright*, where the primary was state-run and thus subject to constitutional scrutiny. Here, the primary is a private affair, and the party, as a private organization, has the First Amendment right to set its own membership criteria and conduct its internal affairs, including primaries, without interference.

The Supreme Court has recognized in cases such as *California Democratic Party v. Jones* that political parties have associational rights under the First Amendment, allowing them to determine their membership and primary rules. Therefore, the court would likely deny relief, as the party's actions are protected by the First Amendment and do not constitute state action subject to the Fifteenth Amendment.

Among the options, the correct answer is:

**H: deny relief, because the political party has the right to choose its own members.**

H
