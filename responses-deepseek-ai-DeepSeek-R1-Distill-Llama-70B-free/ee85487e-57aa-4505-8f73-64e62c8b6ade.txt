Okay, so I have this question about DES, which is the Data Encryption Standard. I'm a bit rusty on my cryptography, but I'll try to think through this.

The question is asking about the sub key length at each round of DES. Hmm. I remember that DES uses a key, but it's split into subkeys for each round. Wait, how does that work again?

DES has a key length of 64 bits, right? But I think some of those bits are parity bits. Oh wait, no, wait. DES uses 56 bits for the actual key because every 8th bit is a parity bit. So the effective key length is 56 bits. But that's the overall key, not the subkeys.

Each round of DES uses a subkey. How many rounds does DES have? I think it's 16 rounds. So for each of the 16 rounds, a subkey is derived from the main key. But what's the length of each subkey?

I recall that in each round, the subkey is 48 bits long. Because the process involves taking bits from the main key, maybe using a rotation and some selection. So each round's subkey is shorter than the main key. Wait, the main key is 56 bits, but each subkey is 48 bits. Oh, because some bits are used more than once or something.

Wait, another way to think about it: the initial key is 64 bits including parity, but the actual key used is 56 bits. Then, for each round, the key is split into two halves, and then they are rotated. After rotation, each half is combined in some way to create the subkey. Oh, right! For each round, a 48-bit subkey is generated by taking some bits from each half after rotation.

So the subkey length per round is 48 bits. Looking at the options, option F is 48. So the answer should be F.

The Data Encryption Standard (DES) uses a 64-bit key, but only 56 bits are effective for encryption, with the remaining 8 bits serving as parity. During encryption, the key is divided into 16 subkeys, each used in a separate round. For each round, a 48-bit subkey is generated by rotating the key halves and selecting specific bits. Therefore, the subkey length at each round of DES is 48 bits.

The correct answer is F: 48.

Answer: F
