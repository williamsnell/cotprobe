Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about estimating the standard reaction Gibbs energy at a different temperature. Hmm, let me think. I remember that Gibbs free energy change for a reaction can be calculated using the standard values of the substances involved. The reaction given is nitrogen gas plus hydrogen gas forming ammonia gas. The question is about finding the Gibbs energy at 1000 K, starting from the values at 298 K.

Wait, so the formula I think I need is ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°. Oh wait, no, that's the general formula for Gibbs free energy. But when we're looking at the change with temperature, I think there's another approach. Oh right, the van 't Hoff equation might come into play here. Or maybe using the relation between ΔG at different temperatures.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight. At standard conditions (298 K), we have ΔG° values for the reaction. But we need to find ΔG° at 1000 K. So I think we can use the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation or the van 't Hoff equation to relate the Gibbs energy at different temperatures.

Wait, the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. But to find ΔG at another temperature, we might need ΔH and ΔS at that temperature, but those can vary with temperature, which complicates things. Alternatively, if we assume that ΔH and ΔS are constant over the temperature range, maybe we can approximate it.

Wait, but the problem states to use the values at 298 K, so perhaps we can assume that ΔH° and ΔS° are taken at 298 K and use them to calculate ΔG° at 1000 K. 

So the formula would be ΔG2 = ΔH° - T2 * ΔS°, where ΔH° is the standard enthalpy change at 298 K, and ΔS° is the standard entropy change at 298 K, and T2 is 1000 K.

But wait, the problem is about the reaction N2(g) + 3 H2(g) → 2 NH3(g). Let me get the standard Gibbs energy of formation for these substances. Wait, I think the standard Gibbs energy of formation (ΔGf°) for elements in their standard state is zero. So for N2, H2, they are zero. 

But I need the ΔG° for the reaction. Oh wait, I think the ΔG° for the reaction at 298 K is given by the sum of the products' ΔGf° minus the sum of the reactants'. So for this reaction, ΔG°(298) = 2*ΔGf°(NH3) - [1*ΔGf°(N2) + 3*ΔGf°(H2)]. Since the elements are in standard form, their ΔGf° is zero. So ΔG°(298) = 2*ΔGf°(NH3).

Wait, but the question doesn't give us the actual values of ΔGf° for NH3. Hmm, that complicates things. Wait, maybe I should remember the values. I think the standard Gibbs of formation for NH3 at 298 K is about -16.45 kJ/mol. So for two moles, it's 2*(-16.45) = -32.9 kJ. So the ΔG° at 298 K is -32.9 kJ/mol.

Wait, but if that's the case, then we can proceed to find the ΔG° at 1000 K. But wait, the problem is asking us to estimate it from the 298 K values, not to compute it using other methods. So probably, I need to compute ΔH° and ΔS° for the reaction at 298 K, then use them to find ΔG at 1000 K.

Wait, but without knowing ΔH°, how can I proceed? Alternatively, maybe the question is using the van 't Hoff equation to relate the Gibbs energy at two temperatures. Hmm.

Wait, the van 't Hoff equation is usually used for equilibrium constants. The equation is ln K = -ΔH°/(R) (1/T) + (ΔS°)/(R). But since we're dealing with Gibbs energy, maybe another approach is better.

Alternatively, the Gibbs energy at temperature T can be calculated using the equation ΔG°(T) = ΔH° - TΔS°. But wait, that's the Gibbs equation, but ΔH° and ΔS° are at 298 K, and we're using them to calculate ΔG° at 1000 K. So this assumes that ΔH° and ΔS° don't change with temperature, which might not be accurate, but the problem says to estimate, so maybe it's acceptable.

So first, I need to find ΔH° and ΔS° for the reaction at 298 K.

The reaction is N2 + 3 H2 → 2 NH3.

The standard enthalpy change ΔH° is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products minus reactants. So ΔH° = 2*ΔHf°(NH3) - [1*ΔHf°(N2) + 3*ΔHf°(H2)]. Again, elements in standard state have ΔHf° = 0, so ΔH° = 2*ΔHf°(NH3).

I think the standard enthalpy of formation for NH3 is about -45.9 kJ/mol. So 2*(-45.9) = -91.8 kJ. So ΔH° = -91.8 kJ.

Similarly, the standard entropy change ΔS° is the sum of the standard entropies of the products minus reactants. So S° = 2*S°(NH3) - [S°(N2) + 3*S°(H2)].

I remember the standard molar entropies: S°(N2) is about 191 J/mol·K, S°(H2) is 130.7 J/mol·K, and S°(NH3) is about 192 J/mol·K. So plugging these in:

ΔS° = 2*(192) - [191 + 3*(130.7)] = 384 - [191 + 392.1] = 384 - 583.1 = -199.1 J/mol·K. Which is -199.1 J/K·mol, or -0.1991 kJ/(K·mol) when converted.

Now, using the Gibbs equation at 1000 K:

ΔG°(1000) = ΔH° - T2 * ΔS°

Wait, but wait. Wait, ΔH° and ΔS° are at 298 K, and I'm using them to calculate ΔG at 1000 K. So the formula is correct in that sense.

So plugging in the numbers:

ΔG°(1000) = (-91.8 kJ) - (1000 K) * (-0.1991 kJ/(K·mol))

Wait, let me calculate that step by step.

First, T2 is 1000 K. ΔS° is -0.1991 kJ/(K·mol).

So T2 * ΔS° = 1000 * (-0.1991) = -199.1 kJ. But since it's - TΔS, it becomes +199.1 kJ.

So ΔG°(1000) = (-91.8) + 199.1 = 107.3 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's positive. So the ΔG° at 1000 K would be approximately +107 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option E is +107 kJ/mol. So the answer should be E.

To estimate the standard reaction Gibbs energy of the reaction:

\[
\mathrm{N}_2(\mathrm{~g}) + 3 \mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{NH}_3(\mathrm{~g})
\]

at 1000 K from its value at 298 K, we use the Gibbs free energy equation:

\[
\Delta G^\circ(T_2) = \Delta H^\circ - T_2 \Delta S^\circ
\]

Here, \( \Delta H^\circ \) and \( \Delta S^\circ \) are the standard enthalpy and entropy changes for the reaction at 298 K. These are calculated as follows:

1. **Standard Enthalpy Change (\( \Delta H^\circ \)):**  
   The standard enthalpy change is the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of the products minus the reactants. For this reaction:

   \[
   \Delta H^\circ = 2 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{NH}_3) - [\Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{N}_2) + 3 \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{H}_2)]
   \]

   Since \( \Delta H_f^\circ \) for elements in their standard state (\( \mathrm{N}_2 \) and \( \mathrm{H}_2 \)) is zero, and \( \Delta H_f^\circ (\mathrm{NH}_3) \approx -45.9 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol} \):

   \[
   \Delta H^\circ = 2(-45.9) = -91.8 \, \mathrm{kJ}
   \]

2. **Standard Entropy Change (\( \Delta S^\circ \)):**  
   The standard entropy change is the sum of the standard entropies of the products minus the reactants. Using standard molar entropies:

   \[
   S^\circ (\mathrm{N}_2) = 191 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K}, \quad S^\circ (\mathrm{H}_2) = 130.7 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K}, \quad S^\circ (\mathrm{NH}_3) = 192 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K}
   \]

   \[
   \Delta S^\circ = 2(192) - [191 + 3(130.7)] = 384 - 583.1 = -199.1 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K} = -0.1991 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol \cdot K}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( \Delta G^\circ(1000 \, \mathrm{K}) \):**  
   Substituting \( \Delta H^\circ = -91.8 \, \mathrm{kJ} \), \( \Delta S^\circ = -0.1991 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol \cdot K} \), and \( T_2 = 1000 \, \mathrm{K} \) into the Gibbs free energy equation:

   \[
   \Delta G^\circ(1000) = -91.8 - (1000)(-0.1991)
   \]

   \[
   \Delta G^\circ(1000) = -91.8 + 199.1 = +107.3 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol}
   \]

Thus, the standard reaction Gibbs energy at 1000 K is approximately \( +107 \, \mathrm{kJ/mol} \), which corresponds to option **E**.

Answer: **E**
