Question:

Costs for producing one widget: Materials:2 parts (a) $25.00 per part Expenses :$10.00 Labor :20 operations (a) $5.00 per operation Based on the above information, which is the only valid conclusion? (A) The selling price should be $160 per widget. (B) labor rates are excessive (C) output is labor intensive (D) material costs are low

Options:

A: (D) material costs are low

G: (B) labor rates are excessive
H: The production process requires minimal labor
I: (A) The selling price should be $160 per widget
J: The majority of the production cost is due to expenses

Okay, so I've got this question about production costs for a widget, and I need to figure out the correct conclusion. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me the costs involved in producing one widget. It's divided into three categories: materials, expenses, and labor. I need to calculate each part and then see which option correctly concludes something about these costs.

Alright, starting with materials. It says materials are 2 parts at $25.00 each. So for each widget, materials would cost 2 times $25. Let me write that down: 2 * 25 = $50. So materials cost $50 per widget.

Next up is expenses. It's a flat $10.00. That's straightforward. So expenses add $10 to each widget.

Now, labor. It says 20 operations at $5.00 per operation. So for each widget, labor costs would be 20 times $5. Let me calculate that: 20 * 5 = $100. Wait, that seems high. So labor is $100 per widget.

Wait, adding all these up: materials ($50) + expenses ($10) + labor ($100) equals a total of $160 per widget. So the total production cost is $160.

Now, looking at the options. Let me go through each one.

Option A: (D) material costs are low. Hmm, materials are $50, which is less than labor's $100, but compared to the total cost of $160, I'm not sure if $50 is considered low. Maybe, but I need to see other options.

Option B: Each widget requires $50 of labor. Wait, no, I calculated labor as $100, so this is wrong.

Option C: Expenses are the largest contributor to the cost per widget. But expenses are only $10, which is the smallest. So this is incorrect.

Option D: Materials make up more than half of the total production cost. Materials are $50, total is $160. Half of 160 is 80. 50 is less than 80, so this is false.

Option E: The total production cost is less than $100 per widget. Wait, total is $160, so E is incorrect.

Option F: (C) output is labor intensive. Labor is $100, which is the largest part. So the output is indeed labor-intensive. So F might be correct, but let me check other options.

Option G: (B) labor rates are excessive. Well, labor is the biggest cost, but whether it's excessive depends on context. The question doesn't provide info on industry standards, so I'm not sure if we can conclude that.

Option H: The production process requires minimal labor. No, because labor is $100, which is a lot, so H is incorrect.

Option I: (A) The selling price should be $160 per widget. Well, the production cost is $160, but selling price isn't necessarily the same as cost. There's no info on markup or profit margins, so we can't conclude this.

Option J: The majority of the production cost is due to expenses. No, expenses are only $10, so J is wrong.

So from the options, F says output is labor-intensive, which makes sense because labor is the highest cost. Also, option F is labeled as (C) which corresponds to the choice C in the original options. Wait, the multiple-choice options are labeled A to J, each representing a possible conclusion. So the correct conclusion is that output is labor-intensive. Looking back, option F is (C) output is labor intensive, so the correct answer is F.

Wait, but let me double-check. The total cost is $160, so if labor is $100, that's 62.5% of the cost. So yes, labor is the main contributor, making it labor-intensive. So the correct conclusion is option C, which would be answer F in the options given (since F corresponds to option C).

The costs for producing one widget are calculated as follows:

- **Materials**: 2 parts at $25.00 each = $50.00  
- **Expenses**: Flat rate of $10.00  
- **Labor**: 20 operations at $5.00 each = $100.00  

Adding these together, the **total production cost** is $50 (materials) + $10 (expenses) + $100 (labor) = **$160.00 per widget**.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: "Material costs are low." While $50 is less than labor's $100, it is not necessarily "low" relative to the total cost.  
- **B**: "Each widget requires $50 of labor." Incorrect, as labor costs $100.  
- **C**: "Expenses are the largest contributor to the cost per widget." Incorrect, as expenses are only $10, the smallest contributor.  
- **D**: "Materials make up more than half of the total production cost." Incorrect, as materials ($50) are less than half of $160.  
- **E**: "The total production cost is less than $100 per widget." Incorrect, as the total is $160.  
- **F**: "Output is labor-intensive." Correct, as labor ($100) is the largest cost component.  
- **G**: "Labor rates are excessive." This is subjective and cannot be concluded from the data.  
- **H**: "The production process requires minimal labor." Incorrect, as labor costs are significant.  
- **I**: "The selling price should be $160 per widget." Selling price is not necessarily equal to production cost.  
- **J**: "The majority of the production cost is due to expenses." Incorrect, as expenses are only $10.

The correct conclusion is **F: Output is labor-intensive**, as labor represents the largest portion of the total production cost.
