Okay, so I have this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the gravitational force on a person when they're in an accelerating car. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The problem states: A person with a mass of 70 kg is sitting in a car that's accelerating at 4 m/s². I need to find the gravitational force on him. The options are A through J, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, gravitational force... Oh, right, that's usually the weight of the person, which is mass times gravity. But wait, does the acceleration of the car affect this? Because the car is accelerating, does that change his apparent weight?

I remember something about apparent weight when in an accelerating elevator or vehicle. When the car accelerates, the apparent weight can change. Like, if you're in a car that's accelerating forward, you feel heavier, right? Because there's the actual gravitational force plus the pseudo force from the acceleration.

But wait, gravitational force is different. The actual gravitational force is still mg, regardless of the car's motion. Because F_gravity = m * g, where g is 9.8 m/s². But when the car accelerates, the normal force changes, making the apparent weight different. So maybe the question is a bit of a trick, because it's asking for the gravitational force, not the apparent weight.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the question again. It specifically asks for the gravitational force. So regardless of the car's acceleration, the gravitational force on the person is just his mass times g.

So the person's mass is 70 kg. Gravitational force F = m * g = 70 kg * 9.8 m/s². Let me calculate that. 70 times 9 is 630, and 70 times 0.8 is 56, so 630+56=686 Newtons. Hmm, so that's approximately 686 N.

Looking at the options, let me check. Option E is 6.86 × 10² N, which is 686 N. Oh, wait, but wait another moment. The car is accelerating at 4 m/s². If the question was about the normal force or apparent weight, that would be different. But it's about gravitational force, which is just mg.

Wait, why is the car's acceleration given then? Maybe it's a red herring, meant to distract. Because the gravitational force doesn't depend on the state of motion, only on mass and gravity. So the 4 m/s² is probably irrelevant here.

So the correct answer should be F = 70 * 9.8 = 686 N, which is option E. Let me double-check the options:

Option E: 6.86 ×10² N =686 N. Yep, that's the one.
</think>

The gravitational force on a person is calculated using the formula \( F = m \cdot g \), where \( m \) is the mass and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (\( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)). The problem specifies a mass of \( 70 \, \text{kg} \), so:

\[
F = 70 \cdot 9.8 = 686 \, \text{N}.
\]

The car's acceleration (\( 4 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)) does not affect the gravitational force, as gravitational force depends only on mass and gravity. Therefore, the correct answer is \( 6.86 \times 10^2 \, \text{N} \), which corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
