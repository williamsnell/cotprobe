Okay, so I have this problem about buying a used car on an installment plan, and I need to find the rate of interest. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. 

Alright, the car is worth $1650. The purchaser made a down payment of $50, right? So that means the amount they're financing is the price minus the down payment. Let me calculate that: $1650 minus $50 equals $1600. So they're paying for $1600 over time.

Now, the total monthly payments over two years add up to $1840. Wait, so the total amount paid is the sum of the down payment and the monthly payments. That would be $50 plus $1840, which equals $1890. So the total paid is $1890 for a car worth $1650. The difference here must be the interest. Let me check: $1890 minus $1650 is $240. So the interest paid over two years is $240.

But wait, the question is about the rate of interest computed on the entire amount paid by the purchaser. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Wait, the entire amount paid is $1890, but the interest is calculated based on the amount financed. Or is it? Wait, no, the interest is on the amount being financed, which is $1600, right?

So the interest is $240 on $1600 over two years. I think I need to find the annual interest rate here. Since it's over two years, I can calculate the rate per year. 

Let me recall the simple interest formula: I = P * r * t. Where I is interest, P is principal, r is rate, t is time in years. Here, I is $240, P is $1600, t is 2 years. I need to find r.

So rearranging the formula, r = I / (P * t). Plugging in the numbers: 240 / (1600 * 2) = 240 / 3200. Let me compute that. 240 divided by 3200. Hmm, 3200 goes into 240 zero times. Maybe I can simplify the fraction. 240/3200 = 24/320 = 3/40. Converting that to decimal: 3 divided by 40 is 0.075, which is 7.5%. So the rate is 7.5% per year.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes interest can be compounded. But the problem doesn't specify compounding, so I think simple interest applies here. Yeah, that makes sense because for installment plans, usually it's simple interest.

So the answer should be 7.5% annually. Looking at the options, option A is 7.5% per year, so the answer must be A.

To determine the rate of interest computed on the entire amount paid by the purchaser, we start by calculating the total amount financed and the total interest paid. The car is worth $1650, and the down payment is $50, so the amount financed is:

\[
\text{Amount Financed} = \$1650 - \$50 = \$1600
\]

The total monthly payments over two years amount to $1840. Adding the down payment, the total amount paid is:

\[
\text{Total Amount Paid} = \$50 + \$1840 = \$1890
\]

The interest paid is the difference between the total amount paid and the price of the car:

\[
\text{Interest} = \$1890 - \$1650 = \$240
\]

This interest is calculated on the amount financed ($1600) over a period of 2 years. Using the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot r \cdot t
\]

Where:
- \(I = \$240\) (interest),
- \(P = \$1600\) (principal),
- \(t = 2\) years,
- \(r\) is the annual interest rate.

Rearranging for \(r\):

\[
r = \frac{I}{P \cdot t} = \frac{240}{1600 \cdot 2} = \frac{240}{3200} = 0.075
\]

Converting to a percentage:

\[
r = 0.075 \times 100 = 7.5\%
\]

Thus, the annual interest rate is 7.5%. The correct answer is:

**A: 7.5% per year**
