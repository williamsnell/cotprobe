Question:

A field is in the shape of a trapezoid. The shorter base of the trapezoid is 130 yards long and the longer base is 390 yards long. The distance between the two bases is 75 yards. What is the area of the field?

Options:

A: 24,375 yards^2

C: 43,875 yards^2
D: 48,750 yards^2
E: 9,750 yards^2
F: 29,250 yards^2
G: 58,500 yards^2
H: 19,500 yards^2
I: 14,625 yards^2
J: 39,000 yards^2

Okay, so I have this problem about finding the area of a trapezoid-shaped field. Hmm, I remember that a trapezoid has two parallel sides called bases, and the other two sides are non-parallel. The formula for the area of a trapezoid is something like the average of the two bases multiplied by the height, right?

Wait, let me think. Oh yeah, the formula is (base1 + base2)/2 multiplied by the height. So the bases here are the shorter and longer ones given in the problem. The shorter base is 130 yards, and the longer one is 390 yards. The distance between the two bases is 75 yards, which I think is the height.

So plugging in the numbers, I calculate the average of 130 and 390 first. Let me add them: 130 + 390 equals 520. Then divide by 2, that's 260. So the average of the two bases is 260 yards.

Now I multiply that by the height, which is 75 yards. So 260 * 75. Hmm, let me do this multiplication. 260 times 70 is 18,200, and 260 times 5 is 1,300. So adding those together, 18,200 + 1,300 equals 19,500. Wait, that's 19,500 square yards.

Wait a second, looking at the options, option H is 19,500 yards². But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes with big numbers. Maybe I should multiply 260 by 75 differently. Let's try breaking it down again: 75 times 200 is 15,000, and 75 times 60 is 4,500. Adding those gives 19,500 again. So that seems correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 19,500, which matches my calculation. But I'm a bit confused because I thought sometimes the height might be different, but in this case, the problem states that the distance between the two bases is 75 yards, which is the height. So I think I did it right. So the area should be 19,500 yards squared.

The area of a trapezoid is calculated using the formula: 

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{(\text{base}_1 + \text{base}_2)}{2} \times \text{height}
\]

Given:
- Shorter base (\(\text{base}_1\)) = 130 yards
- Longer base (\(\text{base}_2\)) = 390 yards
- Height = 75 yards

First, calculate the average of the two bases:

\[
\frac{130 + 390}{2} = \frac{520}{2} = 260 \, \text{yards}
\]

Next, multiply this average by the height:

\[
260 \times 75 = 19,500 \, \text{yards}^2
\]

Thus, the area of the field is **19,500 yards²**, which corresponds to option **H**.
