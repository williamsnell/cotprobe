Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a concave shaving mirror. The question is asking about the distance the mirror should be held from the man's face to get a two-fold magnification. The focal length is given as 20 inches. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let me think this through.

Alright, first, I remember that concave mirrors are converging mirrors. They can produce real or virtual images depending on where the object is placed relative to the focal point. Since this is a shaving mirror, I'm assuming the image is virtual because you don't want the mirror to focus sunlight or something and cause burning or anything. So virtual image, which for concave mirrors happens when the object is within the focal length.

Wait, but wait, the magnification is two-fold. Oh, right, magnification m is the ratio of image height to object height. But in terms of distances, there's a formula. I think it's m = -d_i / d_o, where d_i is image distance and d_o is object distance. Or wait, is it the other way around? No, I think it's m = -d_i / d_o because the image distance can be positive or negative depending on whether it's real or virtual. Oh, right, for mirrors, the magnification is also given by m = h_i / h_o = -d_i / d_o.

So if the magnification is two-fold, that means m = 2. But wait, wait, is that a positive or negative two? Because for mirrors, the sign tells you about the orientation. Concave mirrors can produce upright or inverted images depending on where the object is. Since m is positive 2, that would mean the image is upright and virtual, right? Because for mirrors, a positive magnification means upright image.

So m = 2, which equals -d_i / d_o. So 2 = -d_i / d_o. So d_i = -2 d_o.

Wait, but I also remember the mirror equation, which is 1/f = 1/d_o + 1/d_i. The focal length f is positive for concave mirrors because they are converging. Here, f is 20 inches.

Putting m into the mirror equation. Let's see. Let me try:

m = -d_i / d_o → d_i = -m d_o.

Substituting into the mirror equation:

1/f = 1/d_o + 1/d_i → 1/20 = 1/d_o + 1/(-2 d_o).

Wait, because m is 2, so d_i = -2 d_o.

So substituting:

1/20 = (1/d_o) + (1/(-2 d_o)).

Combining the terms on the right:

(1/d_o) - (1/(2 d_o)) = (2 - 1)/(2 d_o) ) → 1/(2 d_o).

So 1/20 = 1/(2 d_o).

So 2 d_o = 20 → d_o = 10 inches.

Wait, that would make the object distance 10 inches. So the mirror should be held 10 inches from his face. Let me check the options. Option C is 10 in. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. If the object is at 10 inches, which is within the focal length of 20, so yes, that makes sense because the image would be virtual, upright, and magnified. Since d_o is 10, let's compute d_i.

From d_i = -2 * d_o → d_i = -20 inches. Negative because it's a virtual image behind the mirror.

Now plugging into the mirror equation:

1/20 = 1/10 + 1/(-20) → 1/20 = (2/20 - 1/20) → 1/20 = 1/20. Yep, that checks out.

So the correct answer is 10 inches, which is option C.

To determine how far the concave shaving mirror should be held from the man's face to produce a two-fold magnification, we use the principles of mirror optics. The focal length of the mirror is given as \( f = 20 \, \text{in} \), and the magnification \( m \) is defined as:

\[
m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o},
\]

where \( d_i \) is the image distance and \( d_o \) is the object distance. For a two-fold magnification, \( m = 2 \), so:

\[
2 = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} \quad \Rightarrow \quad d_i = -2 d_o.
\]

The mirror equation is:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}.
\]

Substituting \( d_i = -2 d_o \) into the mirror equation:

\[
\frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{-2 d_o}.
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:

\[
\frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{d_o} - \frac{1}{2 d_o} = \frac{2 - 1}{2 d_o} = \frac{1}{2 d_o}.
\]

Equating the two sides:

\[
\frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{2 d_o} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2 d_o = 20 \quad \Rightarrow \quad d_o = 10 \, \text{in}.
\]

Thus, the mirror should be held **10 inches** from the face to produce a two-fold magnification. This corresponds to option **C**.
