Question:

In an automobile accident case, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent by driving at an excessive speed. The defendant's attorney calls its first witness, who was standing along the side of the road when the plaintiff's and defendant's cars collided. The defendant's attorney asks the witness: "Is it a fact that in your estimation, plaintiff was traveling at a speed of 45 m. p. h. in a 35 m. p. h. speed zone at the time of the accident?" The plaintiff objects. The trial judge should

Options:

A: overrule the objection, because the judge may take judicial notice of the speed limit within the jurisdiction.
B: overrule the objection if the witness has already been shown to be an experienced driver who was able to estimate the approximate speed of moving vehicles.
C: sustain the objection if the witness has not been qualified as an expert witness.
D: sustain the objection, because the witness is not an adverse witness.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with objections and witness testimony. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is an automobile accident case where the defendant is claiming the plaintiff was contributorily negligent by speeding. The defendant's attorney calls a witness who was standing by the road when the collision happened. The attorney asks the witness: "Is it a fact that in your estimation, the plaintiff was traveling at 45 mph in a 35 mph zone at the time of the accident?" The plaintiff objects, and the question is what the trial judge should do.

The options are A through D. I need to figure out which one is correct based on evidence rules.

First, I remember that lay witnesses can give opinions under certain conditions. The Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 701 allows lay opinion testimony if it's based on the witness's perception, helpful to understanding the testimony, and not based on specialized knowledge.

So in this case, the witness is estimating the speed. Speed estimation can be a lay opinion if the witness has a basis for that opinion. For example, if the witness is familiar with judging speed, maybe because they drive regularly or have experience in such matters.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Overrule because the judge can take judicial notice of the speed limit. I think judicial notice is about facts that are common knowledge or can be verified, like the speed limit in the area. But the objection here is about the witness's testimony on speed, not the speed limit itself. The witness's opinion on the speed is a separate issue from the speed limit. So A might not be the right reason to overrule.

Option B: Overrule if the witness is an experienced driver who can estimate speed. This makes sense because if the witness has experience, their opinion is admissible as a lay opinion under FRE 701. So the objection would be overruled because the witness is qualified to give that estimate.

Option C: Sustain if the witness isn't qualified as an expert. Wait, but the question is about lay opinion, not expert testimony. If the witness isn't testifying as an expert but as a layperson, then they don't need to be qualified as an expert. So C would be incorrect because the witness doesn't need expert qualification for a lay opinion.

Option D: Sustain because the witness isn't adverse. I'm not sure about this. Adverse witnesses relate to the rule where a party can impeach their own witness if they're hostile. But the issue here is the form of the question or the qualification of the witness to testify on speed. So D probably isn't the right reason.

So focusing on option B: the key is whether the witness is experienced enough to estimate speed. If the witness has been shown to be an experienced driver, then their opinion is admissible. So the trial judge should overrule the objection in that case.

Wait, but does the question state whether the witness has been qualified? The question says that the defendant's attorney calls the witness, but it doesn't say if the witness was qualified as experienced. So the answer would depend on that. If the witness hasn't been qualified, then the testimony might be improper. But the option B says "if the witness has already been shown to be an experienced driver," so in that case, the objection would be overruled.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. The judge should overrule the objection if the witness is qualified as an experienced estimator of speed.

The correct answer is B. The trial judge should overrule the objection if the witness has already been shown to be an experienced driver capable of estimating the approximate speed of moving vehicles. Lay witnesses are permitted to provide opinion testimony under FRE 701 if their opinions are based on their perception and are helpful to understanding their testimony. In this scenario, the witness's estimation of speed would qualify as a lay opinion if they are experienced enough to make such assessments.

Answer: B
