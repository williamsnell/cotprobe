Okay, so I have this problem about an installment plan for a movie camera. Let me try to understand it step by step. The camera costs $98, and the payment plan is 10% down with the balance paid over 24 weekly payments of $4 each. I need to find the annual interest rate. Hmm, right, this sounds like it involves calculating the interest rate on an installment loan.

First, I think I should figure out how much is being paid in total and then determine the interest part. Let's break it down.

The down payment is 10% of $98. So 10% of 98 is 0.1 * 98 = $9.8. So that's the initial payment. The remaining balance would be 98 - 9.8 = $88.2.

Now, the balance is paid over 24 weeks with each payment being $4. So total payments would be 24 * 4 = $96. Wait, that's the total paid over time, but part of that is the principal and part is the interest. So the total amount paid is the down payment plus the weekly payments. So 9.8 + 96 = $105.8. The original price is $98, so the total interest paid is 105.8 - 98 = $7.8.

Wait, but the question is about the annual interest rate. I think I need to calculate the interest rate based on the loan terms. So this is probably a simple interest calculation, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an installment loan with each payment including both principal and interest.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should model this as a loan where each weekly payment is $4, and the total amount financed is $88.2. So the problem becomes finding the interest rate on a loan of $88.2, which is paid back in 24 weekly installments of $4 each.

I remember that the formula for the installment loan payments is similar to the present value of an annuity. The formula is:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]

Where PV is the present value (the amount financed), PMT is the weekly payment, r is the periodic interest rate, and n is the number of periods.

In this case, PV is $88.2, PMT is $4, and n is 24 weeks. We need to find r, the weekly interest rate, and then multiply by the number of weeks in a year to get the annual rate. But wait, since the payments are weekly, the rate would be per week. So we'll calculate r per week and then multiply by 52 to get the annual rate.

So plugging into the formula:

88.2 = 4 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-24 ) / r ]

Hmm, this equation might be a bit tricky to solve algebraically. I might need to use trial and error or an approximation method because solving for r directly isn't straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I can use the rule of 78 or some other method, but I think the present value approach is correct here.

Let me rearrange the formula to solve for r. Let's denote:

(1 - (1 + r)^-24 ) / r = 88.2 /4 = 22.05

So,

(1 - (1 + r)^-24 ) = 22.05 * r

Hmm, I can try plugging in some values to see which r satisfies this equation.

Let me try r = 0.05 (5% per week). Let's compute the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS).

LHS: 1 - (1.05)^-24

Calculate (1.05)^24. Let's see, (1.05)^24 is approximately e^(24*0.05) since for small r, ln(1+r) ≈ r. So 24*0.05=1.2, e^1.2≈3.32. So (1.05)^24 ≈ 3.32, so 1/3.32 ≈ 0.301. So LHS ≈ 1 - 0.301 = 0.699.

RHS: 22.05 * 0.05 = 1.1025.

Wait, that's way off. LHS is 0.699, RHS is 1.1025. So 0.699 < 1.1025, so r=0.05 is too high because at r=0.05, LHS < RHS. So I need a lower r. Because if r is higher, the denominator is bigger, so the present value decreases.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me try smaller r values.

Let's try r=0.03 (3% per week).

Compute (1.03)^24. Let's see, 1.03^24. Let me compute step by step:

1.03^2 = 1.0609

1.03^4 = (1.0609)^2 ≈ 1.1255

1.03^8 ≈ (1.1255)^2 ≈ 1.2683

1.03^16 ≈ (1.2683)^2 ≈ 1.6113

1.03^24 = 1.03^16 * 1.03^8 ≈ 1.6113 * 1.2683 ≈ ~2.044.

So 1/(1.03^24) ≈ 0.489.

So LHS: 1 - 0.489 = 0.511.

RHS: 22.05 * 0.03 = 0.6615.

So 0.511 < 0.6615, still LHS < RHS. So r=0.03 is still too high. Need smaller r.

Try r=0.025 (2.5% per week).

Compute 1.025^24.

1.025^2 = 1.050625

1.025^4 = (1.050625)^2 ≈ 1.103812

1.025^8 ≈ (1.103812)^2 ≈ 1.2184

1.025^16 ≈ (1.2184)^2 ≈ 1.4843

1.025^24 = (1.025^16)*(1.025^8) ≈ 1.4843 * 1.2184 ≈ 1.806.

So 1/(1.025^24) ≈ 0.55.

LHS: 1 - 0.55 = 0.45.

RHS: 22.05 * 0.025 = 0.55125.

So 0.45 < 0.55125. Still, LHS < RHS. So r=0.025 is too high. Need lower r.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's try r=0.02 (2% per week).

Compute 1.02^24.

1.02^2=1.0404

1.02^4= (1.0404)^2≈1.082432

1.02^8=(1.082432)^2≈1.1715

1.02^16=(1.1715)^2≈1.3716

1.02^24=1.3716 * 1.1715≈1.608.

So 1/(1.02^24)≈0.622.

LHS: 1 - 0.622=0.378.

RHS: 22.05 * 0.02=0.441.

Now, LHS=0.378 < RHS=0.441. Still, LHS < RHS. So r=0.02 is too high. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting tedious. Let me think of another way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the N-ratio method or another approximation. Alternatively, since this is multiple choice, perhaps I can compute the interest and then approximate the rate.

Wait, another approach: The total interest is $7.8 over the principal of $88.2. But wait, that's the total interest over 24 weeks. So the interest rate per week would be total interest divided by the average outstanding balance.

Wait, but that's not accurate because the principal is being paid down each week, so the average balance is roughly half of the initial principal. So the initial principal is $88.2, and each week, $4 is paid, which goes towards principal and interest.

Wait, perhaps using the simple interest formula: I = P * r * t.

But I don't think that's directly applicable here because each payment includes both principal and interest, so it's an amortizing loan. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the total interest paid and then find the equivalent annual rate. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the timing of payments matters.

The total interest is $7.8, as calculated before. But this interest is spread over 24 weeks. So the rate per week would be 7.8 / 88.2 = approximately 0.088 (8.8%) per week. Wait, but that can't be right because 8.8% per week times 52 weeks would be over 450%, which is way higher than any of the options.

Wait, no, wait. That approach is wrong because the interest isn't simply 7.8 / 88.2 each week. Because each week, part of the payment goes to interest and part to principal. So the initial weeks have more interest, and less principal, and the later weeks have less interest.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the average balance. The average balance would be (initial principal + final principal)/2. Since the final principal is zero, the average balance is 88.2 / 2 = 44.1. Then, the interest is 7.8, so the rate would be (7.8 / 44.1) / (24/52) years.

Because 24 weeks is 24/52 ≈ 0.4615 years. So:

Interest = 7.8 = Average balance * rate * time.

So rate = 7.8 / (44.1 * 0.4615) ≈ 7.8 / (20.34) ≈ 0.3835 or 38.35%. Hmm, that's close to option E (36.8%) or maybe option H (42%).

Wait, but this might not be precise because the average balance assumption may not hold exactly. Alternatively, perhaps using the total interest and total payments to compute the rate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the APR using another method. Let me think about the total cost. The total amount paid is $105.8 for a $98 camera. But the down payment is $9.8, so the amount financed is $88.2, as before.

Each weekly payment is $4 for 24 weeks, totaling $96. So the interest is $96 - $88.2 = $7.8.

Now, to find the interest rate, perhaps using the formula for simple interest, but that's I = P * r * t. But t is in years. So t = 24 weeks = 24/52 ≈ 0.4615 years.

So r = I / (P * t) = 7.8 / (88.2 * 0.4615) ≈ 7.8 / (40.75) ≈ 0.191 or 19.1%. Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to use the APR formula, which is based on the fees and interest. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the N-ratio method for installment buying.

Wait, I recall that the N-ratio is the ratio of the total interest to the sum of the digits. Wait, maybe that's another approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the payment factors.

Wait, maybe I should go back to the present value formula and try to solve for r numerically.

Given:

PV = 88.2 = 4 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-24 ) / r ]

So,

(1 - (1 + r)^-24 ) / r = 22.05

Let me try r=0.03 again. Wait, earlier at r=0.03, the left side was 0.511, which was less than 0.6615 (22.05 * 0.03 = 0.6615). So the left side is smaller than what we need.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The equation is:

(1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r = 22.05

So for r=0.03, the left side was 0.511, which is less than 22.05 * 0.03 = 0.6615? No, wait, no. Wait, 22.05 is 88.2 /4, correct? Oh wait, no. Wait, 88.2 =4 * [ ... ], so [ ... ]=88.2/4=22.05.

So the equation is:

(1 - (1 + r)^-24 ) / r = 22.05

So, at r=0.03, the left side is 0.511, which is less than 22.05. So that's way too low. Hmm, that can't be. Because when r increases, the denominator increases, so the left side decreases. So if I'm getting 0.511 at r=0.03, which is much less than 22.05, I must have made a miscalculation.

Wait, no. Wait, let me correct. The left side is (1 - (1 + r)^-24) / r. So when r is small, (1 + r)^-24 is close to 1, so 1 - that is small, so the numerator is small, but the denominator is also small. So for small r, the whole expression is large.

Wait, perhaps I should try a much smaller r. Let me try r=0.01 (1% per week).

Compute (1.01)^24: Let's approximate. 1.01^24 ≈ e^(24*0.01) = e^0.24 ≈ 1.271. So 1/(1.01^24) ≈ 0.786. So 1 - 0.786 = 0.214. Then, 0.214 / 0.01 = 21.4. Hmm, that's less than 22.05. So at r=0.01, left side is 21.4, which is very close to 22.05.

So the solution for r is slightly less than 1% per week. Let's try r=0.0095 (0.95% per week).

Compute (1.0095)^24. Let's compute this step by step.

Alternatively, using the approximation:

ln(1.0095) ≈ 0.00945.

So ln((1.0095)^24) = 24 * 0.00945 ≈ 0.2268.

So (1.0095)^24 ≈ e^0.2268 ≈ 1.254.

So 1/(1.0095)^24 ≈ 0.793.

So 1 - 0.793 = 0.207.

Then, 0.207 / 0.0095 ≈ 21.789. Still a bit below 22.05.

Try r=0.009 (0.9% per week).

Compute (1.009)^24.

ln(1.009)≈0.00895.

24 * 0.00895≈0.2148.

e^0.2148≈1.2398.

So 1/(1.009)^24≈0.805.

So 1 - 0.805=0.195.

0.195 / 0.009≈21.666. Still below 22.05.

Hmm, getting closer. Let's try r=0.0085 (0.85% per week).

ln(1.0085)=approx 0.00847.

24 * 0.00847≈0.2033.

e^0.2033≈1.225.

So 1/(1.0085)^24≈0.814.

So 1 - 0.814=0.186.

0.186 / 0.0085≈21.882. Still below 22.05. So need to go lower.

Try r=0.008 (0.8% per week).

ln(1.008)= approx 0.007968.

24 * 0.007968≈0.1911.

e^0.1911≈1.210.

So 1/(1.008)^24≈0.826.

1 - 0.826=0.174.

0.174 / 0.008=21.75. Still lower than 22.05.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should set up an equation and solve numerically.

Let me denote f(r) = (1 - (1 + r)^-24)/r - 22.05.

We need to find r where f(r)=0.

We can use linear approximation between two points where f(r) is positive and negative.

Wait, when r approaches 0, (1 - (1 + r)^-24)/r approaches 24, because using the limit as r→0 of [1 - (1 + r)^-n]/r = n. So at r=0, it's 24, which is higher than 22.05. So when r increases from 0, f(r) decreases from 24 towards lower values.

We saw that at r=0.008, f(r)=21.75-22.05= -1.3 (wait, no, wait, f(r)= (1 - (1 + r)^-24)/r - 22.05.

Wait, at r=0.008, (1 - (1.008)^-24)/0.008 = [1 - 1/(1.008)^24]/0.008 ≈ (1 - 0.826)/0.008 = 0.174/0.008=21.75. So f(r)=21.75 -22.05= -0.3.

Wait, wait, no: f(r) is [ (1 - (1 + r)^-24 ) / r ] - 22.05. So when r=0.008, [ ... ] =21.75, so f(r)=21.75 -22.05= -0.3.

At r=0.005: let's compute.

(1.005)^24: Let's approximate.

ln(1.005)=approx 0.004975.

24 * 0.004975≈0.1194.

e^0.1194≈1.1265.

So 1/(1.005)^24≈0.887.

So 1 -0.
