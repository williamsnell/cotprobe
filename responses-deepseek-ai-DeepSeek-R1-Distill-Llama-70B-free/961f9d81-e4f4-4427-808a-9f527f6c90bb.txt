Okay, so I have this physics problem here about protons used in cancer therapy. The question is about how much work must be done on a proton to accelerate it to 0.6 times the speed of light. Hmm, I remember that when particles are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, we have to consider relativistic effects. So I can't just use the classical kinetic energy formula here.

Wait, right, the classical formula is (1/2)mv², but that's only valid for low speeds. When the speed is a large fraction of c, like 0.6c, I need to use the relativistic kinetic energy formula. Oh right, the formula for relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So γ is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Let me write that down. γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.6c, v²/c² is 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. The square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So γ is 1 divided by 0.8, which is 1.25.

Wait, wait, no. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.6 squared is 0.36, right? So 1 - 0.36 is 0.64. The square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So yes, γ is 1 / 0.8, which equals 1.25.

So the kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc². Plugging in γ=1.25 gives (1.25 - 1) which is 0.25. So 0.25 mc². Looking at the options, that's option D.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Because sometimes I get confused between work done and the energy. Oh right, the work done on the particle is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. Since it starts from rest, the initial kinetic energy is zero, so the work done is just the final kinetic energy. So yes, it's 0.25 mc².

I think that's right. So the answer should be D.

To determine the work required to accelerate a proton to 0.6c, we must account for relativistic effects. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by:

\[
K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\). For \(v = 0.6c\), we calculate:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

Substituting \(\gamma = 1.25\) into the kinetic energy formula:

\[
K = (1.25 - 1)mc^2 = 0.25mc^2
\]

Thus, the work done on the proton is equal to its relativistic kinetic energy, which is \(0.25mc^2\). Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D: 0.25mc²**

Answer: D
