Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about waves on a brass wire. I'm a bit rusty on wave mechanics, but let me try to think this through.

The question is asking about the tension needed so that the speed of longitudinal and transverse waves are the same. Hmm, I remember that different types of waves have different speed formulas. Let's break this down.

First, I'll recall the formulas for the speeds of longitudinal and transverse waves. Longitudinal waves, like sound waves in a solid, their speed depends on the material's properties. The formula I think is v_longitudinal = sqrt( (Y * density) / (density^2) ) ), wait, no, wait. Oh right, Young's modulus Y is involved. Let me get this right.

Wait, the speed of a longitudinal wave in a rod is given by v_L = sqrt( Y / ρ ), where Y is Young's modulus and ρ is the density of the material. Yeah, that sounds right.

And for transverse waves, like the waves we get when you shake a string, the speed is v_T = sqrt( T / μ ), where T is the tension and μ is the linear mass density (mass per unit length). Oh wait, μ is mass per unit length, which is density times cross-sectional area, right? Because density is mass per volume, so μ = ρ A.

So the problem states that the cross-sectional area A is 10² cm². Wait, 10²? So 100 cm². Let me convert that to m² because SI units are usually in meters, but wait the Young's modulus is given in dynes·cm², so maybe I should keep everything in cgs units. Oh right, the question uses cm, so perhaps working in cgs would be easier.

So the cross-sectional area A is 10^2 cm², which is 100 cm². But wait, wait, the way it's written is 10^\rule{1em}{1pt}2 cm². Oh I think that's 10 squared, so 100 cm². Yeah, that's correct.

We need to set v_L equal to v_T. So,

sqrt( Y / ρ ) = sqrt( T / μ )

But μ is (mass per unit length) = (density) * (area) = ρ A.

So substituting μ,

sqrt( Y / ρ ) = sqrt( T / (ρ A) )

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

Y / ρ = T / (ρ A)

Oh wait, I can cancel out the ρ terms on both sides.

Y = T / A

So T = Y * A.

Wait, that's interesting. So the tension required is just Young's modulus multiplied by the cross-sectional area. Because when we set the two speeds equal, the densities cancel out.

So plugging in the numbers:

Y is given as 9.1e11 dynes/cm².

A is 100 cm².

So T = 9.1e11 dynes/cm² * 100 cm².

Hmm, let me compute that. 9.1e11 * 100 is 9.1e13 dynes.

Wait, but dynes is a unit of force. So the tension would be 9.1e13 dynes.

But wait, I need to think about whether this is physically possible. Because that's a huge tension. Let me think about the units as well.

Wait, Y is in dynes/cm², which is the same unit as pressure. So Y is stress (force per area), so when you multiply by area, you get force. So yeah, the units check out.

But brass is a metal, and its strength might not allow such a high tension. So is this possible?

I remember that Young's modulus for brass is around 9e11 dynes/cm², which is correct. Now, the cross-sectional area is 100 cm², which is a pretty large area. So 9.1e11 * 100 is 9.1e13 dynes. Wait, how much is that in a more familiar unit, like Newtons?

1 dyne is 1e-5 Newtons. So 9.1e13 dynes * 1e-5 N/dyne = 9.1e8 Newtons.

That's 910,000,000 Newtons. That's an incredibly huge force. For a wire with cross-section 100 cm², which is 0.01 m², that would mean an enormous stress.

Wait, because stress is force per area, so F/A would be 9.1e8 N / 0.01 m² = 9.1e10 N/m². But Young's modulus is about stress over strain. But wait, Young's modulus itself is just a material property, but the actual stress that a material can withstand is limited by its ultimate strength.

What's the typical ultimate tensile strength for brass? I'm not exactly sure, but I think metals have strengths in the order of 1e8 to 1e9 Pascals. Let me check my memory. For example, steel has a young's modulus around 2e11 Pa and ultimate strength maybe 5e8 Pa. Brass, I think, has a lower strength than steel. Maybe around 4e8 Pa?

So if the required stress here is 9.1e10 Pa (since 9.1e10 N/m² is 9.1e10 Pa), which is higher than the ultimate strength of brass, then the wire would break before reaching that tension. So it's not physically realizable because the required tension exceeds the material's strength.

So the answer is "Physically unrealizable", which is option I.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

We set v_L = v_T.

v_L = sqrt(Y / ρ )

v_T = sqrt( T / μ ), where μ = ρ A.

So equating them:

sqrt(Y/ρ) = sqrt(T/(ρ A))

Squaring both sides: Y/ρ = T/(ρ A)

Canceling ρ: Y = T/A => T = Y*A.

Yes, correct.

So T = Y * A = (9.1e11 dynes/cm²) * (100 cm²) = 9.1e13 dynes.

Convert to N: 9.1e13 * 1e-5 = 9.1e8 N.

Stress = F/A = 9.1e8 N / (100 cm²) → 100 cm² is 0.01 m², so 9.1e8 / 0.01 = 9.1e10 Pa.

Assuming that the ultimate tensile strength of brass is lower than this value, which I think it is, then the wire would fracture before reaching that tension. So the situation is not physically realizable.

Therefore, the correct answer is I: Physically unrealizable.

To determine the tension required for the speed of longitudinal and transverse waves to be the same in a brass wire, we start by equating the formulas for the speeds of these waves. The speed of a longitudinal wave is given by:

\[
v_L = \sqrt{\frac{Y}{\rho}}
\]

where \(Y\) is Young's modulus and \(\rho\) is the density of the material. For transverse waves, the speed is:

\[
v_T = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}
\]

where \(T\) is the tension and \(\mu\) is the linear mass density, which is related to the density and cross-sectional area by \(\mu = \rho A\). Setting \(v_L = v_T\), we have:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{Y}{\rho}} = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\rho A}}
\]

Squaring both sides and canceling \(\rho\), we find:

\[
Y = \frac{T}{A} \quad \Rightarrow \quad T = Y \cdot A
\]

Given \(Y = 9.1 \times 10^{11} \, \text{dynes/cm}^2\) and \(A = 10^2 \, \text{cm}^2 = 100 \, \text{cm}^2\), the tension is:

\[
T = (9.1 \times 10^{11}) \cdot 100 = 9.1 \times 10^{13} \, \text{dynes}
\]

Converting to Newtons (\(1 \, \text{dyne} = 10^{-5} \, \text{N}\)):

\[
T = 9.1 \times 10^{13} \cdot 10^{-5} = 9.1 \times 10^8 \, \text{N}
\]

The stress (force per unit area) is:

\[
\text{Stress} = \frac{T}{A} = \frac{9.1 \times 10^8}{100} = 9.1 \times 10^{10} \, \text{Pa}
\]

This stress is extremely high and exceeds the ultimate tensile strength of brass, which is typically around \(4 \times 10^8 \, \text{Pa}\). Therefore, the wire would fracture before reaching this tension, making the situation physically unrealizable.

The correct answer is:

**I: Physically unrealizable**
