Question:

Adam Smith is considering automating his pin factory with the purchase of a $475,000 machine. Shipping and installation would cost $5,000. Smith has calculated that automation would result in savings of $45,000 a year due to reduced scrap and $65,000 a year due to reduced labor costs. The machine has a useful life of 4 years and falls in the 3-year property class for MACRS depreciation purposes. The estimated final salvage value of the machine is $120,000. The firm's marginal tax rate is 34 percent. The incremental cash outflow at time period 0 is closest to

Okay, so I've got this finance problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Adam Smith is considering automating his pin factory by buying a machine that costs $475,000. Then there's an additional $5,000 for shipping and installation. So the initial cost is more than just the machine itself. He expects savings from reduced scrap and labor, which are $45,000 and $65,000 per year respectively. The machine's useful life is 4 years, but it's classified under the 3-year property for MACRS depreciation. The salvage value is estimated at $120,000, and the tax rate is 34%. The question is about finding the incremental cash outflow at time zero, which I think means the initial investment.

So, the initial outlay should include the cost of the machine, shipping, and installation, right? That would be 475,000 + 5,000 = $480,000. But wait, I remember that when calculating cash flows for projects, especially with taxes, we have to consider the tax implications. So I'm not sure if the initial outflow is just this amount or if some adjustments are made because of depreciation and taxes.

Wait, the initial cash outflow is the amount spent at time zero. So that's straightforward: the cost of the machine plus shipping and installation. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people talk about net cash flow, which factors in tax savings from depreciation. But at time zero, the only cash outflow is the initial investment, right?

Wait, but I might be wrong. Let me think again. The initial outflow is just the cash that goes out, which is the purchase and installation cost. Depreciation affects taxable income and thus taxes, but the cash outflow for the machine is a separate thing. So the initial investment is $480,000. But let me make sure.

Let me consider the possible options. Looking at the options, option G is $480,000, which matches the initial cost. But wait, the question is about the incremental cash outflow. Could there be another aspect?

Wait, another thought: Sometimes, in capital budgeting, the initial outlay includes the cost of the asset plus any initial working capital, but in this problem, there's no mention of working capital changes, so I can ignore that.

Alternatively, could the salvage value affect the initial cash flow? No, because salvage value is at the end when the machine is sold. So it's a cash inflow in year 4, not affecting the initial outflow.

So then, the initial cash outflow is $475,000 + $5,000 = $480,000. But wait, let me check the options again. Option G is $480,000, which would be the answer. But wait, the options include other numbers too. Let me see why some might think differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the net cash outflow considering tax implications. But I don't think taxes would affect the initial cash outflow. The initial payment is in cash. Taxes come into play in future periods when calculating tax savings from depreciation.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial cash outflow is the amount paid, so $480,000. But perhaps the problem is more complex. Wait, MACRS depreciation is involved. So maybe the depreciation tax shield affects the cash flows, but only in the future periods, not at time zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the present value of the tax shield, but no, the question is specifically about the cash outflow at time zero, so it's just the initial cost.

Wait, but let me double-check the question. It says, "the incremental cash outflow at time period 0". That should be the initial investment, which is the cost of the machine plus shipping and installation. So that's 475k +5k=480k, which is option G.

But wait, looking at the options, option G is $480,000, which is exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer should be G.

The incremental cash outflow at time period 0 is the initial investment required to purchase and install the machine. This includes the cost of the machine ($475,000) and the shipping and installation costs ($5,000), totaling $480,000. Depreciation and tax considerations, such as the MACRS depreciation method and tax savings, affect future cash flows but do not impact the initial cash outflow at time zero. Therefore, the incremental cash outflow at time period 0 is $480,000.
