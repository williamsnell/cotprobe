Okay, so I have this anatomy question in front of me about the articulation of the sixth rib. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

I remember that ribs articulate with the thoracic vertebrae. Each rib has a head, which connects to the vertebrae. The head of the rib is at the posterior end, right? The way the articulation works is that each rib's head has two facets, superior and inferior. 

Wait, but how exactly do they connect? I think each rib's head articulates with the bodies of two adjacent vertebrae. So for example, the fifth rib would connect with T4 and T5, right? Because the numbering is a bit tricky. 

So the question is about the sixth rib. Let's break it down. The head of the sixth rib would articulate with which vertebrae? I remember that the superior part of the head connects to the inferior facet of the upper vertebra, and the inferior part connects to the superior facet of the lower vertebra.

Wait, no, maybe I got that backwards. Let me think again. The superior articular facet of the rib head should connect with the inferior articular facet of the upper vertebra, and the inferior articular facet of the rib connects with the superior of the next lower vertebra. Or is it the other way around?

Oh wait, no. The head of each rib has two articular facets. The superior facet articulates with the inferior facet of the upper thoracic vertebra, and the inferior facet of the rib's head articulates with the superior facet of the lower thoracic vertebra. 

So for the sixth rib, the superior part (superior demifacet) of its head should connect to the inferior demifacet of T5, and the inferior part (inferior demifacet) would connect to the superior demifacet of T6. Because the sixth rib is between T5 and T6.

Wait, but wait. Some sources mention that each rib articulates with the same numbered vertebra and the one above. Like, the fifth rib connects with T4 and T5. So the sixth rib would connect with T5 and T6.

But I'm a bit confused about the exact terms here. The options are talking about either facets or demifacets. Oh right, because the thoracic vertebrae have these demifacets. Each thoracic vertebra has a superior and inferior demifacet on each side, which together form the articular facets for the ribs.

So each rib's head has two demifacets. The superior demifacet of the rib's head articulates with the inferior demifacet of the upper vertebra, and the inferior demifacet of the rib's head articulates with the superior demifacet of the lower vertebra.

So for the sixth rib, the superior demifacet would connect to the inferior demifacet of T5, and the inferior demifacet would connect to the superior demifacet of T6.

Looking at the options, option E says: The superior articular demifacet of T5 and the inferior articular demifacet of T6. Wait, no, that's the opposite. Wait, no, the question is about what the head of the sixth rib articulates with. So the head's superior demifacet connects to T5's inferior, and the head's inferior demifacet connects to T6's superior.

So the answer should be that the sixth rib's head articulates with the inferior articular demifacet of T5 and the superior articular demifacet of T6.

Looking at the options, option E is "The superior articular demifacet of T5 and the inferior articular demifacet of T6." No, that doesn't match. Option C is "The inferior articular demifacet of T5 and the superior articular demifacet of T6." Yes, that fits.

Wait, but let me make sure. So the head of the rib (sixth) has two parts: the superior demifacet and the inferior. The superior part connects to the inferior of the upper vertebra (T5), and the inferior connects to the superior of the lower vertebra (T6). So the correct articulation is with T5's inferior demifacet and T6's superior demifacet.

So looking again, option C says: The inferior articular demifacet of T5 and the superior articular demifacet of T6. That's correct.

Another option to check is option E: superior of T5 and inferior of T6. That's the opposite, so no.

Option A says it's the inferior of T5 and superior of T6, but it refers to articular facets, not demifacets. Wait, the question is about demifacets, right? Because the answer options mention demifacets, so I think option C is correct.

Wait, the question says: The head of the sixth rib articulates with which of the following. So the options are about the structures it connects to, which would be the demifacets on the vertebrae.

So the correct answer should be option C.
</think>

The head of the sixth rib articulates with the inferior articular demifacet of T5 and the superior articular demifacet of T6. Each rib's head has two demifacets: the superior demifacet articulates with the inferior demifacet of the upper vertebra, and the inferior demifacet articulates with the superior demifacet of the lower vertebra. For the sixth rib, this means its superior demifacet connects to the inferior demifacet of T5, and its inferior demifacet connects to the superior demifacet of T6. Among the options, only option C correctly describes this relationship.

Answer: C
