Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about what predicts a child's adjustment after their parents get divorced. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which factor is the best predictor of a child's post-divorce adjustment in the first two years. The options are A through J, each with different factors.

First, I remember that when parents get divorced, it's a big change for the kids. How they adjust probably depends on a lot of things. I think the level of conflict between the parents is a big one. Like, if the parents are always fighting even after the divorce, that's probably really hard on the kids. Maybe that makes it harder for them to adjust.

I've heard that ongoing conflict can lead to more emotional problems in children. So option C is about continued conflict after the divorce. That seems important. But wait, what about the level of involvement of the non-custodial parent, which is option A? I think that matters too because if the other parent is still involved, the child might feel more secure. But is it the best predictor?

Then there's option D, which is about the hostility during the divorce process. That's probably bad, but maybe it's more about the initial stages. After the divorce, ongoing conflict (option C) might be more influential in the long run.

Option E is about the child living with the preferred parent. I guess that could make them happier, but I'm not sure how much that affects adjustment compared to other factors. Plus, sometimes the preferred parent isn't the custodial one, so maybe this isn't the top factor.

Option B is the child's age at the time of divorce. I think younger kids might adjust differently than older ones, but I'm not sure if age is the best predictor overall. It might influence how they understand the situation, but maybe not the main factor in adjustment.

Option F is about academic performance before the divorce. That could be a factor, but I'm not sure how strong it is compared to family dynamics. If a child was doing well before, maybe they have better coping skills, but again, maybe not the top predictor.

Option G is financial status after the divorce. Financial stability can affect a lot, but maybe not as directly as the emotional environment. Kids might adjust better if their basic needs are met, but I think conflict has a more direct impact on their emotional adjustment.

Option H is withdrawal of the more disturbed parent. If a parent who's troubled steps back, maybe that's better for the child, but I'm not sure how big a role this plays.

Option I is support from extended family. Having a good support system can help, but again, maybe not the strongest predictor compared to direct parental interactions.

Option J is contact with friends. Friends are important for a child's well-being, but I'm not sure if the frequency of contact is the top factor here.

So, putting it all together, I think the key is the environment the child is in after the divorce. Continued conflict between parents (option C) would create a stressful home situation, which can affect the child's mental health and adjustment more than other factors like financial status or academic performance. Whereas, if the parents get along after the divorce, the child is likely to adjust better.

The best predictor of a child's post-divorce adjustment during the first two years is the degree of continued conflict between the parents after the divorce. This is because ongoing conflict creates a stressful environment that directly impacts the child's emotional well-being and ability to adjust. While other factors like parental involvement, financial stability, and support systems play roles, the emotional tension from persistent conflict is the most significant factor affecting adjustment.

Answer: C
