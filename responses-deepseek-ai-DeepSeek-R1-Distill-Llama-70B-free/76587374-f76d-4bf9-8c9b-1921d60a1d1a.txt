Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: The first term of a given sequence is 1, and each successive term is the sum of all the previous terms of the sequence. What is the value of the first term which exceeds 5000?

Hmm. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, let's break it down. The sequence starts with 1. Let's call the terms a1, a2, a3, and so on.

So, a1 is 1. Now, each next term is the sum of all previous terms. So, a2 would be the sum of a1, which is 1. So a2 = 1.

Wait, no, wait a second. Because each successive term is the sum of all the previous terms. So maybe I should think about how each term is built.

Let me try writing out the first few terms to see the pattern.

a1 = 1.

a2 is the sum of all previous terms, which is just a1. So a2 = 1.

a3 is the sum of a1 + a2. That's 1 + 1 = 2.

a4 is the sum of a1 + a2 + a3. So 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

a5 would be the sum of a1 + a2 + a3 + a4. Let's calculate that: 1+1=2, +2=4, +4=8. So a5 is 8.

Wait a minute, I'm noticing a pattern here. Let me list them:

a1:1

a2:1

a3:2

a4:4

a5:8

a6:16

a7:32

a8:64

a9:128

a10:256

a11:512

a12:1024

a13:2048

a14:4096

a15:8192

Wait, so each term after a2 is double the previous term. Because a3 is 2, a4 is 4 (which is 2*2), a5 is 8 (4*2), and so on.

But wait, let me confirm that. Because each term is the sum of all previous terms. So for example, a3 is a1 + a2 = 1+1=2. a4 is a1+a2+a3=1+1+2=4, which is 2*2. a5 is a1+a2+a3+a4=1+1+2+4=8, which is 4*2. So yes, each term is double the previous term starting from a3.

Wait, but a2 is 1, same as a1. Then a3 is 2, which is a2 * 2. So from a2 onwards, it's doubling each time.

So the sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192,...

Wait, let me check a6. a6 should be sum of a1 to a5: 1+1+2+4+8 = 16. Yep, that's correct.

So the pattern is that each term after a2 is twice the previous term. So the sequence is 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.

Wait, but looking at the terms, after a2, it's 2, 4, 8, which is 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, etc. So starting from a3, each term is 2^(n-2), where n is the term number.

Wait, let me think: for a3, n=3, 2^(3-2) =2^1=2. Correct.

a4: 2^(4-2)=4, correct.

Yes. So the general term for n >=3 is 2^(n-2).

But wait, let me make sure. a1=1, a2=1, a3=2, a4=4, a5=8, a6=16, a7=32, a8=64, a9=128, a10=256, a11=512, a12=1024, a13=2048, a14=4096, a15=8192.

So the first term that exceeds 5000 would be the first term in this sequence that's bigger than 5000.

Looking at the terms, a14 is 4096, which is less than 5000. a15 is 8192, which is bigger than 5000.

So the first term exceeding 5000 is 8192, which is a15.

Looking at the options, option A is 8192.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when I think the terms are doubling, it's easy to get confused.

Another approach: Let's list the terms with their indices and values.

Term 1: 1

Term 2: 1 (sum of term1)

Term3: 1+1=2

Term4: 1+1+2=4

Term5: 1+1+2+4=8

Term6: 1+1+2+4+8=16

Term7: 1+1+2+4+8+16=32

Term8: sum up to term7 is 64?

Wait, no: Wait, term7 is 32, the sum up to term7 would be 1+1+2+4+8+16+32= 64. So term8 is 64.

Wait, term8 is 64. Then term9 is sum up to term8, which is 1+1+2+4+8+16+32+64 = 128.

Yes, that's consistent with the earlier pattern.

So each term is the sum of all previous terms, which for term n is equal to 2^(n-2) for n>=2.

Wait, actually, for term n, where n>=2, the value is 2^(n-2). So term n=2 is 1=2^0, n=3 is 2^1=2, etc.

So to find the first term exceeding 5000, we can solve 2^(n-2) > 5000.

Let's compute:

2^12 = 4096

2^13 = 8192.

So 2^13 is 8192, which is greater than 5000. So the term where n-2=13, so n=15.

So the 15th term is 8192, which is the first term exceeding 5000.

Looking back at the options, option A is 8192. So the correct answer should be A.
</think>

The sequence starts with \( a_1 = 1 \), and each subsequent term is the sum of all previous terms. Calculating the first few terms reveals the pattern:

- \( a_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_2 = 1 \) (sum of \( a_1 \))
- \( a_3 = 2 \) (sum of \( a_1 + a_2 \))
- \( a_4 = 4 \) (sum of \( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 \))
- \( a_5 = 8 \) (sum of \( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 \))
- \( a_6 = 16 \) (sum of \( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 \))

From \( a_3 \) onwards, each term is double the previous term, following the pattern \( a_n = 2^{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 3 \). To find the first term that exceeds 5000, we solve \( 2^{n-2} > 5000 \). The smallest \( n \) satisfying this is \( n = 15 \), where \( a_{15} = 8192 \).

Thus, the first term exceeding 5000 is \( 8192 \), corresponding to option **A**.
