Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by dissolving sodium ethanoate. Hmm, sodium ethanoate is the sodium salt of ethanoic acid, right? So, I remember that sodium ethanoate dissociates in water to give ethanoate ions and sodium ions. Sodium is a spectator ion, so it doesn't affect the pH. The ethanoate ion is the conjugate base of ethanoic acid, which is a weak acid. So, the solution should be basic because the conjugate base will hydrolyze in water.

Wait, the problem gives me the Ka for ethanoic acid. Oh right, Ka is for the acid, and since I have the conjugate base, I need to find the Kb for the ethanoate ion. I remember that Kw = Ka * Kb, and Kw is 1.0e-14 at 25°C. So Kb would be Kw / Ka. Let me calculate that.

Ka is 1.8e-5, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.8e-5) = approximately 5.5556e-10. Okay, so Kb is around 5.56e-10. That's a small value, meaning the base is weak, so it doesn't hydrolyze much.

Next, I need to find the concentration of the sodium ethanoate solution. The problem says 0.0300 mol in 50 mL of solution. So the concentration is 0.0300 mol / 0.050 L = 0.6 M. Oh wait, wait, wait. Sodium ethanoate is NaOC2H5, which dissociates completely into Na+ and OC2H5^- in solution. So the concentration of the ethanoate ion is 0.6 M.

Now, the hydrolysis reaction is: OC2H5^- + H2O ↔ HC2H5O2 + OH^-. The Kb expression is [HC2H5O2][OH^-]/[OC2H5^-] = 5.56e-10.

Since Kb is small, the amount of hydrolysis is minimal, so I can approximate that [OC2H5^-] is about 0.6 M, and the changes are negligible. So setting up the ICE table:

Initial:
[OC2H5^-] = 0.6 M
[OH^-] = 0
[HC2H5O2] = 0

Change:
[OC2H5^-] decreases by x
[OH^-] increases by x
[HC2H5O2] increases by x

Equilibrium:
[OC2H5^-] = 0.6 - x
[OH^-] = x
[HC2H5O2] = x

So substituting into Kb equation:

(x^2) / (0.6 - x) = 5.56e-10

Since Kb is so small, x is much smaller than 0.6, so 0.6 - x ≈ 0.6. So the equation becomes x² / 0.6 = 5.56e-10. Solving for x²: x² = 5.56e-10 * 0.6 = 3.336e-10. So x is sqrt(3.336e-10) ≈ 5.778e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 5.778e-5 M. Then pOH is -log10(5.778e-5). Let me calculate that. 

Log(5.778e-5): log(5.778) is about 0.76, so log(5.778e-5) is 0.76 -5 = -4.24. So pOH is 4.24. Then pH is 14 - pOH = 14 -4.24 = 9.76. Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, wait, no: pOH = -log [OH^-]. So [OH^-] is 5.778e-5. So log(5.778e-5) is like log(5.778) + (-5). Log(5.778) is about 0.76, so total is 0.76 -5 = -4.24. So pOH is 4.24, so pH is 14-4.24=9.76. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see 9.76. Let me check the options again.

The options are A:11.02, B:6.44, C:10.04, D:2.5, E:12.8, F:4.74, G:8.15, H:9.26, I:7, J:5.5. So 9.76 is close to option H which is 9.26, but a bit higher. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps the approximation isn't valid. Let me see. I assumed that x is much less than 0.6. Let's see, x is 5.778e-5, which is 0.05778 compared to 0.6. So 0.05778 is about 0.096% of 0.6. So the approximation holds. So perhaps my calculation is correct, but the answer isn't among the options? Wait, maybe I missed something.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact quadratic equation. Let me try that. So the equation is x² = (5.56e-10)(0.6 - x). Expanding, x² = 3.336e-10 - 5.56e-10 x. Rearranging: x² +5.56e-10 x -3.336e-10 =0. Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a). Here a=1, b=5.56e-10, c= -3.336e-10.

Discriminant: (5.56e-10)^2 +4*1*3.336e-10. Let's compute that: (3.09e-19) + (1.334e-9) = approx 1.334e-9, since 3e-19 is negligible. So sqrt(1.334e-9)= approx 3.653e-5. So x= [ -5.56e-10 ± 3.653e-5 ]/(2). Taking the positive root, x= (3.653e-5 -5.56e-10)/2 ≈ 3.647e-5 /2 = about 1.8235e-5. So [OH-] is 1.8235e-5. Wait, that's lower than before. Then pOH would be higher. Wait, that can't be right. Did I miscalculate the discriminant?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let's see: the equation is x² +5.56e-10 x -3.336e-10 =0. So a=1, b=5.56e-10, c= -3.336e-10. So discriminant is b² -4ac? Wait no, wait the quadratic is ax² +bx +c =0, but in our case, equation is x² + (5.56e-10)x -3.336e-10 =0. So a=1, b=5.56e-10, c= -3.336e-10.

So discriminant D = b² -4ac = (5.56e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-3.336e-10) = (3.09e-19) + (1.3344e-9) = approx 1.3344e-9. So sqrt(D)=sqrt(1.3344e-9)= approx 3.653e-5. So solution x = [-b ± sqrt(D)]/(2a) → [ -5.56e-10 +3.653e-5 ]/(2). 

So x = (3.653e-5 -5.56e-10)/2 ≈ (3.647e-5)/2 ≈ 1.8235e-5. So [OH-] is 1.8235e-5 M. pOH is -log(1.8235e-5). Let's compute that.

Log(1.8235e-5): log(1.8235) is about 0.26, so log(1.8235e-5)=0.26 -5= -4.74. So pOH is 4.74. Then pH is 14-4.74=9.26. Oh, look at that! Option H is 9.26. So that must be the correct answer. So I probably made a mistake earlier with the approximation, but using the exact quadratic gave me a pH of 9.26, which matches option H.

So why did the approximation method give me a higher [OH-]? Oh because when I assumed x is negligible, I got x=5.778e-5, but the exact solution gives x=1.8235e-5, which is much lower. So perhaps my initial approximation was incorrect, and the quadratic was needed here. So the correct answer is H:9.26.

To determine the pH of a solution made by dissolving 0.0300 mol of sodium ethanoate in 50 mL of water, we start by recognizing that sodium ethanoate (NaOC₂H₅) is the sodium salt of ethanoic acid (HC₂H₅O₂). Sodium ethanoate dissociates completely in water into Na⁺ (a spectator ion) and OC₂H₅⁻ (the conjugate base of ethanoic acid). The solution will be basic due to the hydrolysis of OC₂H₅⁻ in water:

\[
\text{OC₂H₅⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{HC₂H₅O₂} + \text{OH⁻}
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant, \( K_b \), which is related to the acid dissociation constant \( K_a \) of ethanoic acid by:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a}
\]

Given \( K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \) and \( K_w = 1.0 \times 10^{-14} \), we calculate:

\[
K_b = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.8 \times 10^{-5}} = 5.56 \times 10^{-10}
\]

Next, the concentration of sodium ethanoate is calculated as:

\[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{moles of sodium ethanoate}}{\text{volume of solution in liters}} = \frac{0.0300 \, \text{mol}}{0.050 \, \text{L}} = 0.6 \, \text{M}
\]

The hydrolysis reaction is modeled using an ICE table:

- Initial: \([ \text{OC₂H₅⁻} ] = 0.6 \, \text{M}, [ \text{OH⁻} ] = 0, [ \text{HC₂H₅O₂} ] = 0\)
- Change: \([ \text{OC₂H₅⁻} ] = -x, [ \text{OH⁻} ] = +x, [ \text{HC₂H₅O₂} ] = +x\)
- Equilibrium: \([ \text{OC₂H₅⁻} ] = 0.6 - x, [ \text{OH⁻} ] = x, [ \text{HC₂H₅O₂} ] = x\)

The \( K_b \) expression is:

\[
K_b = \frac{[ \text{HC₂H₅O₂} ][ \text{OH⁻} ]}{[ \text{OC₂H₅⁻} ]} = \frac{x^2}{0.6 - x}
\]

Since \( K_b \) is very small, \( x \) is much smaller than 0.6, so \( 0.6 - x \approx 0.6 \). This simplifies the equation to:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.6} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 = (5.56 \times 10^{-10})(0.6) = 3.336 \times 10^{-10}
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{3.336 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 5.778 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, \([ \text{OH⁻} ] = 5.778 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}\). The pOH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log_{10}[ \text{OH⁻} ] = -\log_{10}(5.778 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.24
\]

The pH is then:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.24 = 9.76
\]

However, this result does not match the given options. To refine the calculation, the quadratic equation is solved without approximations:

\[
x^2 + (5.56 \times 10^{-10})x - (3.336 \times 10^{-10}) = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 5.56 \times 10^{-10} \), and \( c = -3.336 \times 10^{-10} \). The discriminant is:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = (5.56 \times 10^{-10})^2 - 4(1)(-3.336 \times 10^{-10}) \approx 1.334 \times 10^{-9}
\]

\[
\sqrt{1.334 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 3.653 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Substituting back:

\[
x = \frac{-5.56 \times 10^{-10} + 3.653 \times 10^{-5}}{2} \approx 1.8235 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, \([ \text{OH⁻} ] = 1.8235 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}\), and:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log_{10}(1.8235 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.74
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - 4.74 = 9.26
\]

This matches option **H: 9.26**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**H: 9.26**

Answer: H
