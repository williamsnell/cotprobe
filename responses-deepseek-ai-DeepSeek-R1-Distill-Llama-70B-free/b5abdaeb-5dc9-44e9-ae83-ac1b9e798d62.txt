Question:

Are the daughter nuclei formed during cleavage exactly equivalent , or is there some sort of parceling out of potentialities during cleavage?

Options:

A: Partial segregation of genetic potentialities during cleavage
B: Partial segregation of genetic potentialities, influenced by environmental factors during cleavage
C: Random parceling out of genetic potentialities independent of cleavage
D: Segregation of genetic potentialities occurs, but only in specific cell lineages
E: Segregation of genetic potentialities only in later stages
F: Segregation of genetic potentialities with bias toward cellular location
G: No segregation of genetic potentialities during cleavage
H: Segregation of genetic potentialities based on maternal and paternal origin
I: Segregation of genetic potentialities during cleavage
J: Equal segregation of genetic potentialities, but differential activation during cleavage

Okay, so I have this question about cell cleavage and the daughter nuclei formed. Hmm, I remember that cleavage refers to the early divisions of the fertilized egg, right? And the question is whether the daughter nuclei are exactly the same or if there's some sorting of genetic potential during this process.

Wait, I think during cleavage, the embryo undergoes several rapid cell divisions without much growth, so each cell gets smaller. Now, about the nuclei. If they're equivalent, that would mean each has the same potential, but if not, maybe some get different stuff.

In some organisms, like mammals, I believe the early divisions are such that each cell (blastomere) is totipotent, meaning each could develop into a whole organism. So in that case, the nuclei would be equivalent because their genetic material is the same. But wait, is that always true? I seem to recall that in some species, like certain insects or frogs, the embryo might have some unequal distribution of cytoplasmic components, like determinants in the egg. But the question is specifically about the nuclei and genetic potential.

Oh, right, in mammals, cleavage is such that the cells are identical in terms of their nuclear genetic material. So the daughter nuclei would be exactly equivalent. Therefore, there's no parceling out of potentialities during cleavage. So the answer should be about no segregation.

Looking at the options:

Option G says no segregation during cleavage. That fits because the nuclei are genetically equivalent. So the answer would be G.

Wait, but another thought: some sources mention that in some cases, even during cleavage, there might be some initial segregation, but I'm pretty sure in humans and many other mammals, the early cleavage stages are such that the cells are identical. So the nuclei are equivalent, so no segregation.

Therefore, the correct answer is G.

The question asks whether the daughter nuclei formed during cleavage are exactly equivalent or if there is a parceling out of genetic potentialities. Cleavage refers to the early divisions of a fertilized egg, characterized by rapid cell divisions without significant growth, resulting in smaller cells called blastomeres. In many organisms, particularly mammals, these blastomeres are totipotent, meaning each has the potential to develop into a complete organism. This implies that the genetic material in the daughter nuclei is equivalent, with no segregation of genetic potentialities during cleavage.

Analyzing the options, **Option G** states "No segregation of genetic potentialities during cleavage," which aligns with the understanding that the nuclear genetic material is evenly distributed during cleavage in many species, including mammals. Other options suggest some form of segregation or influence from external factors, which are not applicable to the general case of cleavage.

Thus, the correct answer is:

G: No segregation of genetic potentialities during cleavage.
