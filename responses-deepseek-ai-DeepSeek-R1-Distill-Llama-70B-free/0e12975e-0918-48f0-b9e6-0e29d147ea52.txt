Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about identifying a Brønsted-Lowry conjugate acid-base pair. Hmm, I remember that Brønsted-Lowry theory involves acids and bases that donate and accept protons, respectively. A conjugate acid-base pair is when one is the acid and the other is its conjugate base after donating a proton.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one to see which fits. 

Option A: HC2H3O2 and C2H3O2^-. Wait, HC2H3O2 is acetic acid. When it donates a proton, it becomes acetate ion, which is C2H3O2^-. So that's a classic acid-base pair. Acetic acid is the acid, and acetate is the base. So this seems like a possible correct answer.

Option B: SO3^2- and SO2^2-. Hmm, SO3^2- is the sulfite ion, I think. If it donates a proton, it would become SO2^2-? Wait, sulfite to something else. Wait, sulfite is HSO3^-? No, I might be getting this wrong. Sulfite is SO3^2-, and when it acts as an acid, it would donate a proton to become SO3^3-? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, maybe SO3^2- can't act as an acid because it's already the conjugate base of HSO3^- (bisulfite). So the pair here is between sulfite and something else. Wait, the option shows SO3^2- and SO2^2-. Oh wait, SO2^2- is the sulfide ion? Or maybe sulfite and something else. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe this isn't a conjugate pair because the difference is more than a proton.

Option C: H3PO4 and H3PO3. H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. If it donates a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), not H3PO3. H3PO3 is actually a different acid, maybe phosphorous acid. So these two don't form a conjugate pair. The conjugate base of H3PO4 would lose an H+ to become H2PO4^-, so this option doesn't fit.

Option D: H3O+ and OH^-. H3O+ is the hydronium ion, and OH^- is hydroxide. So this is a classic pair. H3O+ donates a proton to become H2O, and OH^- is the base that can accept a proton to become H2O again. So H3O+ is the conjugate acid of H2O, and OH^- is the conjugate base. So this pair is a conjugate acid-base pair. Wait, but wait. The Brønsted-Lowry definition says an acid donates a proton to a base. So in this case, H3O+ would act as an acid, donating a proton to become H2O, and the base that would accept it would be OH^-. Wait, no, because OH^- can't accept a proton to become something else. Wait, wait: Let me think. If H3O+ donates a proton (H+), it becomes H2O. If OH^- accepts a proton, it becomes H2O as well. So H3O+ is the conjugate acid of H2O, and OH^- is the conjugate base of H2O. So together, H3O+ and OH^- are a conjugate acid-base pair. Because H3O+ → H+ + H2O, and OH^- + H+ → H2O. So yes, they form a conjugate pair.

Wait, but looking back, option A is also a valid pair. So now I'm a bit confused. Which one is the correct answer?

The question is to identify the conjugate acid-base pair. So both options A and D are possible. Wait, but let's look again.

Option A: HC2H3O2 and C2H3O2^-.

HC2H3O2 is the acid, and when it donates a proton, it becomes C2H3O2^-, so that's a correct pair.

Option D: H3O+ and OH^-.

H3O+ is the conjugate acid of H2O, and OH^- is the conjugate base of H2O. So, H3O+ is an acid, and OH^- is a base, which are conjugates.

So both A and D are correct pairs. But wait, I need to check the options again.

Wait the options are A through D, and the question is to pick one. So looking at the options, which one is correct.

Wait, the Brønsted-Lowry theory says that an acid donates a proton to a base. So a conjugate acid-base pair would consist of the acid and its conjugate base, which is after losing a proton.

So for example, in option A, the acid is HC2H3O2, and its conjugate base is C2H3O2^-. So that's a correct pair.

In option D, the acid is H3O+, which donates a proton to become H2O, and the base is OH^-, which can accept a proton to become H2O. So H3O+ and OH^- are a conjugate pair because they are related by the transfer of a proton.

Wait, but wait: H3O+ is the conjugate acid of H2O, and OH- is the conjugate base of H2O. So in that sense, H3O+ and OH- are conjugate acid and base. So option D is also correct.

But the question is to pick one correct answer. So I need to see which of the options is a correct conjugate pair.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each option again.

Option A: acid is HC2H3O2, base is C2H3O2^-.

Option D: acid is H3O^+, base is OH^-.

So both are correct. But the options only have four options, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, but the question says "Identify the Brønsted-Lowry conjugate acid-base pair in the following list."

So perhaps both options A and D are correct. But looking at the options, only one is correct.

Wait, but the question lists four options, A to D. So the correct answer must be one of them.

Wait, in the options, both A and D are conjugate pairs. But perhaps the question expects one correct option.

Wait, let's double-check each option.

Option A: HC2H3O2 and C2H3O2^-.

Yes, that's a correct acid-base pair. Acetic acid and acetate ion.

Option D: H3O+ and OH^-.

Yes, hydronium ion (acid) and hydroxide ion (base).

So both are correct. But the problem is, the options are presented as four, and I have to choose one.

Wait, but the question is about Brønsted-Lowry conjugate acid-base pairs. So each pair is an acid and its conjugate base.

So in option A, the acid is HC2H3O2, and the conjugate base is C2H3O2^-.

In option D, the acid is H3O^+, and the conjugate base would be H2O. Wait no, if H3O+ donates a proton, it becomes H2O. So the conjugate base of H3O+ is H2O. But then OH^- is the conjugate base of H2O, when it donates a proton, but wait, OH^- can't donate a proton; it can accept one. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, Brønsted-Lowry says that a base is a proton acceptor. So H3O+ donates a proton to a base, which would be OH^-.

Wait, no, H3O+ is the acid, and it donates a proton to a base. Let's say the base is OH^-: but that's not possible because OH^- is a base, and it would accept a proton, not donate. So in that case, H3O+ is the acid, and when it donates a proton, it becomes H2O, and the base would be OH^-, which would have come from where?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

In the Brønsted-Lowry theory, when an acid donates a proton (H+), it becomes its conjugate base. The base that receives the proton becomes the conjugate acid.

So in option D: H3O+ is the acid. It donates a proton to a base. Let's say the base is OH^-: but OH^- as a base would accept a proton to become H2O. So the pair would be H3O+ (acid) and OH^- (base), but when the acid donates a proton, it becomes H2O, and the base becomes H2O. So I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, H3O+ can act as an acid by donating a proton to a base, say OH^-. Then, H3O+ → H2O + H+, and OH^- + H+ → H2O. Wait, but that doesn't form a conjugate pair between H3O+ and OH^-; it's more like a neutralization.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think of it this way: for a conjugate acid-base pair, one is the acid, and the other is the base formed when the acid loses a proton.

So in option D, H3O+ is the acid. When it donates a proton, it becomes H2O. So the conjugate base of H3O+ is H2O. But the option pairs H3O+ with OH^-, not H2O. So that can't be a conjugate pair. Unless I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Because OH^- is the conjugate base of H2O. H2O can act as an acid, donating a proton to become OH^-.

So H3O+ is the conjugate acid of H2O, and OH^- is the conjugate base of H2O. So H3O+ and OH^- are not a conjugate pair, but they're both related to H2O.

Wait, so H3O+ is H+ + H2O. So when H3O+ donates a proton, it becomes H2O. So the conjugate base of H3O+ would be H2O.

Alternatively, OH^- is the conjugate base of H2O, which when it donates a proton becomes OH^-.

So in option D, H3O+ and OH^- are not a conjugate pair. Because H3O+ → H+ + H2O, and OH^- is from H2O → OH^- + H+.

So maybe option D is not a correct conjugate pair. Because the acid and its conjugate base would be H3O+ and H2O, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. So in that case, option D isn't a conjugate pair because the acid and base are not directly related by a proton transfer. So maybe the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

The Brønsted-Lowry conjugate acid-base pair consists of two species where one donates a proton (the acid) and the other is the base that results from the acid losing a proton.

So in option A: acid is HC2H3O2 (donates H+ → C2H3O2^-). So that's a correct pair.

In option D: H3O+ is the acid, which donates H+ → H2O. The base in this case would be the species that accepts a proton. If H3O+ donates to a base like OH^-, then OH^- would accept a proton to become H2O. But H3O+ and OH^- are not a conjugate pair themselves because they are not directly derived from each other by the loss or gain of a proton.

Wait, H3O+ → H+ + H2O. So the conjugate base would be H2O, not OH^-.

So in option D, the pair is H3O+ and OH^-, which are not directly conjugate. Because H3O+ becomes H2O, and OH^- is from H2O losing a proton.

So perhaps option D is not a correct conjugate pair, while option A is.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option A.
</think>

To identify the Brønsted-Lowry conjugate acid-base pair, we analyze each option based on the definition that a conjugate acid-base pair consists of an acid and its conjugate base, which are related by the loss or gain of a proton (H⁺).

### Option A: **HC₂H₃O₂ and C₂H₃O₂⁻**
- HC₂H₃O₂ (acetic acid) is the acid, and when it donates a proton (H⁺), it forms C₂H₃O₂⁻ (acetate ion), its conjugate base.  
- This is a classic example of a Brønsted-Lowry conjugate acid-base pair.  

### Option B: **SO₃²⁻ and SO₂²⁻**
- SO₃²⁻ (sulfite ion) and SO₂²⁻ do not differ by a single proton. Instead, they differ by both a proton and an oxygen atom, meaning they are not directly related as an acid and its conjugate base.  
- This is not a valid conjugate acid-base pair.  

### Option C: **H₃PO₄ and H₃PO₃**
- H₃PO₄ (phosphoric acid) donates a proton to form H₂PO₄⁻ (dihydrogen phosphate ion), not H₃PO₃ (phosphorous acid).  
- H₃PO₃ is a different compound and not the conjugate base of H₃PO₄.  
- This is not a valid conjugate acid-base pair.  

### Option D: **H₃O⁺ and OH⁻**
- H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion) is the acid, and when it donates a proton, it forms H₂O (water). The conjugate base of H₃O⁺ is therefore H₂O, not OH⁻.  
- OH⁻ (hydroxide ion) is the conjugate base of H₂O, not directly related to H₃O⁺.  
- While H₃O⁺ and OH⁻ are related through water, they are not a direct conjugate acid-base pair.  

### Conclusion:
The only valid Brønsted-Lowry conjugate acid-base pair in the list is **Option A: HC₂H₃O₂ and C₂H₃O₂⁻**.

Answer: **A**
