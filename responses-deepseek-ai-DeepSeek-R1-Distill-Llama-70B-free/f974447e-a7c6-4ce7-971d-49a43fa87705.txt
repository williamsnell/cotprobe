Okay, so I have this question about Taylor polynomials and the Lagrange error. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

The question is asking about the Lagrange error for the fifth-degree Taylor polynomial approximation of f(x) = sin(x) centered at x=0, evaluated at x=1. So I remember that the Taylor polynomial approximates the function near a certain point, and the Lagrange error tells us how accurate that approximation is.

First, I need to recall the formula for the Lagrange error, also known as the remainder term in Taylor series. The formula is R_n(x) = (f^{(n+1)}(c) / (n+1)!) ) * x^{n+1}, where c is some number between 0 and x. Here, n is the degree of the polynomial. Since we're using the fifth-degree polynomial, n=5. So the remainder would involve the sixth derivative of sin(x).

Wait, what's the sixth derivative of sin(x)? Let me think. The derivatives of sin(x) cycle every four steps: first derivative is cos(x), second is -sin(x), third is -cos(x), fourth is sin(x), and then it repeats. So the fifth derivative would be cos(x), because after the fourth it's sin, fifth is cos again. Wait no, wait: let me count.

f(x) = sin(x)
f'(x) = cos(x) → 1st derivative
f''(x) = -sin(x) → 2nd
f'''(x) = -cos(x) → 3rd
f''''(x) = sin(x) → 4th
f'''''(x) = cos(x) → 5th
f''''''(x) = -sin(x) → 6th. Oh right, the sixth derivative is -sin(x).

So f^{(6)}(c) = -sin(c). But the maximum value of sin(c) is 1 and the minimum is -1. So the absolute value of f^{(6)}(c) is ≤ 1.

Now, plugging into the error formula:

R_5(1) = [f^{(6)}(c) / 6! ] * (1)^6.

Since 1^6 is just 1, the error is [ -sin(c) ] / 720. The maximum possible error would be when |sin(c)| is 1, so the maximum error magnitude is 1/720. Let me compute that.

Wait, 720 is 6 factorial, which is 720. So 1/720 is approximately 0.00138888... But wait, looking at the options, I don't see that exact number. Hmm.

Wait, let's double-check. The fifth-degree Taylor polynomial for sin(x) around 0 includes terms up to x^5. So the next term would be the x^7 term, but wait no, wait: the general form is that the remainder for the nth-degree polynomial is based on (n+1)th derivative.

Wait, no: for a Taylor polynomial of degree n, the remainder is R_n(x) = f^{(n+1)}(c)/(n+1)! * x^{n+1}.

Wait, but earlier I thought n=5, so the remainder involves the 6th derivative. So that part is correct.

Wait, but wait, when n=5, the remainder is R_5(x) = f^{(6)}(c)/(6!) x^6. So for x=1, it's f^{(6)}(c)/(720) *1. So R_5(1) = [ -sin(c) ] /720. The maximum possible absolute error is 1/720, which is approximately 0.001388889.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 0.00198, which is about 0.00198, which is larger than 0.001388. Hmm. Option J is 0.00298, which is bigger. Option A is 0.02098, which is about 0.02, which is bigger than 0.0013.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the derivatives. Let me check the derivatives again. Because if I have f(x)=sin(x), then f'(x)=cos(x), f''(x)=-sin(x), f'''(x)=-cos(x), f''''(x)=sin(x), f'''''(x)=cos(x), f''''''(x)=-sin(x). So yes, the sixth derivative is -sin(c). So the absolute value is correct.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the degree. The fifth-degree polynomial would have terms up to x^5. So the next term after x^5 is x^7? No, wait, no. Wait, the Taylor series for sin(x) is x - x^3/3! + x^5/5! - x^7/7! + ... So the fifth-degree polynomial includes up to x^5, and the next term is x^7, but the remainder is based on the next term, which would be the x^7 term. But that's for the infinite series. Wait, but for the Taylor polynomial of degree 5, the remainder is given by R_5(x) = f^{(6)}(c)/6! * x^6. Wait, that's what I had before.

Wait, but in the Taylor series, each term after the nth degree involves higher derivatives. So for the fifth-degree approximation, the remainder is on the sixth derivative.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the polynomial degree and the number of terms. Let me think again. The Taylor polynomial of degree 5 includes terms up to x^5. So P5(x) = x - x^3/6 + x^5/120.

The remainder term is R5(x) = f^{(6)}(c) * x^6 / 6! Because the general formula is R_n(x) = f^{(n+1)}(c)/(n+1)! * x^{n+1}.

So for n=5, R5(x)= f^{(6)}(c)/(6!) x^6.

So when x=1, R5(1) = f^{(6)}(c) / 720.

Since f^{(6)}(c) = -sin(c), the maximum possible |R5(1)| is 1/720 ≈ 0.00138888...

Now, looking at the options, the closest is option B: 0.00198, which is 0.00198. Hmm, but that's a bit higher than 0.001388. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 1/720 is approximately 0.0013888...

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the maximum possible error, which would be 1/(6!) = 1/720 ≈ 0.00138888... So approximately 0.00139.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.00198, which is about 0.002, which is larger than 0.00139. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying n, the degree.

Wait, another approach: the Taylor polynomial P5(x) includes terms up to x^5, so the remainder term would be the next term in the series, which is -x^7 / 7! So maybe I should be calculating R5(x) as that term.

Wait, no, because the remainder formula for the Taylor polynomial of degree n is R_n(x) = f^{(n+1)}(c) / (n+1)! * x^{n+1}.

So for n=5, it's f^{(6)}(c) x^6 / 720.

Wait, but the next term in the series is -x^7 / 7! So perhaps I should use that for the remainder?

Wait, no. Because the Taylor series has the remainder as the next term, but the Lagrange form of the remainder is expressed using the (n+1)th derivative. So for P5(x), the remainder is based on the 6th derivative, as I thought.

So perhaps I'm correct, and the value is approximately 0.001388.

Wait, but none of the options exactly match that. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: 0.02098

B: 0.00198

C: 0.000198

D: 0.01998

E: 0.0198

F: 0.19898

G: 0.0000198

H: 0.198

I: 0.0000298

J: 0.00298

So the closest is option B (0.00198) and option J (0.00298). My calculation was around 0.001388, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the power of x. Wait, for P5(x), which is degree 5, then R5(x) is (f^{(6)}(c)/720) x^6. So when x=1, it's f^{(6)}(c)/(720). So the maximum possible is 1/720 ≈ 0.0013888.

Wait, but perhaps the question isn't asking for the maximum possible error, but the exact error for x=1. Since the error is R5(1) = (-sin(c))/720 * 1^6 = -sin(c)/720. But the value of c is somewhere between 0 and 1. So the error could be as low as -1/720 (if c= 3pi/2, but wait c is between 0 and 1, so sin(c) is positive there, so the remainder is negative.

Wait, but the question is asking for the error in the approximation to sin(1). So the exact value would depend on c. But the question is about the Lagrange error, which is the exact error for some c in (0,1). But without knowing c, how can we compute it?

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the upper bound on the error. Because the maximum possible absolute error is 1/720, which is approximately 0.00138888.

So among the options, the closest is option B, 0.00198, but that's higher than 0.00138. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the degree. Let me double-check.

Wait, the fifth-degree Taylor polynomial for sin(x) is:

P5(x) = x - x^3/3! + x^5/5! 

So the next term is -x^7/7! , but that's beyond the 5th degree. So the remainder for P5(x) would be -x^7/(7!) + x^9/9! - ... But that's the infinite series approach.

Wait, no, the Lagrange remainder for a finite Taylor polynomial of degree n is R_n(x) = f^{(n+1)}(c)/(n+1)! * x^{n+1}.

So for n=5, R5(x) = f^{(6)}(c)/(6! ) x^6.

Which is exactly what I calculated earlier.

So perhaps the actual error is [ -sin(c) ] /720, and since c is between 0 and 1, sin(c) is between 0 and sin(1)≈0.84147.

So the error would be between 0 and -0.84147/720 ≈ -0.001168.

So the exact error is approximately between 0 and -0.001168, but the maximum magnitude is about 0.001168. Hmm, which is less than 0.001388 (which is 1/720).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value. Since the remainder is R5(1) = -sin(c)/720.

But without knowing c, perhaps the question is asking for the maximum possible error, which would be 1/720 ≈ 0.001388.

Looking again at the options, option B is 0.00198, which is higher, and option J is 0.00298.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should compute the remainder using the next term in the series, which would be the x^7 term. So the remainder after the x^5 term is -x^7/7! + x^9/9! - ... But for an approximation, the first omitted term is -x^7/7!.

So the remainder R5(x) is -x^7/(7!) evaluated at some c in (0,1). Wait, but that's when using the Taylor series approach, but the Lagrange remainder is expressed as f^{(n+1)}(c) x^{n+1}/(n+1)!.

So for n=5, that's 6th derivative, which is -sin(c), so R5(x)= (-sin(c) x^6)/720.

So at x=1, that's (-sin(c))/720.

So the maximum possible error is 1/720 ≈ 0.001388.

Wait, but option B is 0.00198, which is roughly 0.002, which is 2/1000 or 1/500, which is 0.002. 1/500 is 0.002, which is bigger than 1/720.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the degree. Let me think: n=5, so the remainder is (n+1)=6.

Wait, another approach: let me compute sin(1) and P5(1), then find the difference.

Compute P5(1):

P5(x) = x - x^3/6 + x^5/120.

At x=1:

P5(1) = 1 - 1/6 + 1/120 = calculate that.

1 is 60/60, 1/6 is 10/60, 1/120 is 0.5/60.

So 60 -10 + 0.5 = 50.5 → 50.5/60 = 0.841666...

The actual sin(1) is approximately 0.841470985.

So the difference is 0.841666... - 0.841470985 ≈ 0.0001952.

Wait, that's about 0.000195, which is approximately 0.0002.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.000198, which is very close.

Wait, but this is the actual error when x=1, computed by taking P5(1) - sin(1), which is about 0.0001952. So the error is approximately 0.000198, which matches option C.

But wait, earlier I thought the Lagrange error formula gives 0.001388, but that's the upper bound for the error. However, the exact error is the actual difference, which is lower. So perhaps the question is asking for the exact error, not the upper bound.

But the question specifically asks for the Lagrange error of the polynomial approximation. The Lagrange error is the remainder term, which is R5(1) = -sin(c)/720.

But without knowing c, we can't compute it exactly. However, the maximum possible is 1/720 ≈ 0.001388, and the minimum is 0.

But when I compute the actual difference, I get about 0.000195, which is option C (0.000198), which is close. So perhaps the question is worded ambiguously, but maybe it's referring to the exact error, which I can compute via subtraction.

But wait, the Lagrange error is the exact error, but it's expressed in terms of c, which is unknown. So perhaps the question is using the maximum error bound, which would be 1/720 ≈ 0.001388. But none of the options match that except perhaps option B (0.00198), which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as the next term in the series, which is the x^7 term.

Wait, the next term after x^5 in the Taylor series is -x^7 / 7!.

So for x=1, that term is -1/(7!) = -1/5040 ≈ -0.0001984.

So the actual error is approximately 0.0001984, which matches option C (0.000198).

Ah, I see! So perhaps the Lagrange error is the next term in the series, which is -x^7/7!.

But wait, the Lagrange remainder formula for the nth degree polynomial is f^{(n+1)}(c)/(n+1)! * x^{n+1}.

In this case, n=5, so f^{(6)}(c) is -sin(c), and x=1, so R5(1) = (-sin(c))/720.

But the next term in the series is -x^7 / 7! = -1/5040 ≈ -0.0001984.

So perhaps the error is approximately 0.000198, which is option C.

But wait, why is this different from the Lagrange remainder approach? Because the Lagrange remainder gives the exact error, but in terms of some c between 0 and x. However, for the Taylor series, the error is exactly the sum of all the higher-order terms beyond the nth degree. So when using the Lagrange remainder, we have an expression involving c, but in the series, the next term is the first term beyond the polynomial.

So perhaps the question is referring to the next term in the series as the error, which would be -1/5040 ≈ -0.0001984. So the absolute value is 0.0001984, which is approximately 0.000198, matching option C.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C: 0.000198.

Wait, but the Lagrange remainder is R5(1) = [ -sin(c) ] / 720. So if sin(c) is about sin(1) ≈ 0.84147, then R5(1) ≈ -0.84147 / 720 ≈ -0.001168. But that's not matching 0.000198.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's clarify:

The Lagrange error R_n(x) is the exact error, given by f^{(n+1)}(c)/(n+1)! * x^{n+1} for some c between 0 and x.

But the next term in the Taylor series is f^{(n+1)}(0)/(n+1)! x^{n+1}.

So in this case, for n=5, the next term is f^{(6)}(0)/(720) x^6.

But f^{(6)}(0) is the sixth derivative of sin(x) at 0. Let's compute that.

f(x)=sin(x)
f'(x)=cos(x) →
