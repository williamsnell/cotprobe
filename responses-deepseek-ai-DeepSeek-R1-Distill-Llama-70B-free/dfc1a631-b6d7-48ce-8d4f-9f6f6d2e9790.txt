Alright, so I have this problem here about finding some factors related to interest rates and series payments. The question gives me the sinking-fund-payment factor for i=5½% and n, and asks me to find three other factors: the uniform-series compound-amount factor, the capital-recovery factor, and the uniform-series present-worth factor. 

Hmm, okay. I'm a bit rusty on these factors, but I remember they're all related to how money compounds over time, especially in uniform series of payments. Let me think about each one and how they relate.

The sinking-fund-payment factor is given as 0.2303. I think that's the factor used to find the payment needed each period to accumulate a certain future amount. The formula for the sinking fund payment (A) is A = F * (sinking fund factor), where F is the future value. The sinking fund factor is calculated as (i) / [(1+i)^n - 1], right?

Wait, but wait. The question says i is 5½%, which is 5.5%. So i = 0.055. But in the question, it says "i = 5(1/2)% =4". Oh wait, maybe that's a typo. No, wait, 5½% is 5.5%, not 4. Oh wait, perhaps the way it's written is i=5 and (1/2)%? No, that can't be right. Oh, maybe the i is 5.5%, which is 11/2 percent, but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different notation. Wait, I'm confused now.

Wait, the question says: "i = 5(1/2)% =4". Wait, that can't be right. 5.5% is 0.055 as a decimal. But 4 would be 4%, which is 0.04. So perhaps the question has a typo? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, perhaps it's i=4%, but the way it's written is 5 and ½ percent, but that equals 4? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's i=5.5%, but the way it's written is 4. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed as if i is 4%, because that's what the number 4 is given as. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the question says, "i=5(1/2)% =4". Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo. Maybe it's i=5.5% equals 0.055, but the "=4" is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps i is 4%, because 5(1/2) might have been a miscalculation. Well, I'll proceed with i=5.5%, which is 0.055, because 5 and a half percent is 5.5%.

Wait, no, perhaps it's i=4%. Because the question says i=5(1/2)%=4. Maybe the "(1/2)" is a typo, and it should be 5% plus ½%, making 5.5%. But 5.5% is 0.055, not 4. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended i=4%, so 0.04. But the initial part says "i =5(1/2)% =4", which is confusing. Well, perhaps I should check the given sinking fund factor to see if it aligns with i=4% or i=5.5%.

The sinking fund factor is given as 0.2303. The formula for the sinking fund factor is (i) / [(1+i)^n -1]. So if i=4%, then it's 0.04. Let's see what that would compute to for some n. Alternatively, with i=5.5%, 0.055.

Wait, but without knowing n, maybe I can find n from the given sinking fund factor. Let me see.

If the sinking fund factor is 0.2303, then:

sinking fund factor = i / [ (1+i)^n -1 ]

So 0.2303 = i / [ (1+i)^n -1 ]

Let me try i=4% (0.04):

0.2303 = 0.04 / [ (1.04)^n -1 ]

Then, [ (1.04)^n -1 ] = 0.04 / 0.2303 ≈ 0.1737

So (1.04)^n ≈ 1.1737

Taking the natural log of both sides:

n * ln(1.04) = ln(1.1737)

ln(1.1737) ≈ 0.1615

ln(1.04)≈ 0.0392

So n ≈ 0.1615 / 0.0392 ≈ 4.12.

Hmm, that's about 4 periods. But let's check for i=5.5%, 0.055:

0.2303 = 0.055 / [ (1.055)^n -1 ]

So [ (1.055)^n -1 ] = 0.055 / 0.2303 ≈ 0.2386

(1.055)^n ≈ 1.2386

Take ln: n * ln(1.055) ≈ ln(1.2386)

ln(1.2386) ≈ 0.2136

ln(1.055)≈ 0.0535

n ≈ 0.2136 / 0.0535 ≈ 4. So n is about 4 periods.

Wait, so for i=4%, n is about 4, and for i=5.5%, n is about 4 as well. Hmm, but the problem states that the same i and n are used as for the given sinking fund factor. So perhaps n is 4. But the problem states "for the same i and n", but the options are all for n=4? Or does the problem not specify n, but perhaps I can proceed?

Wait, but the problem doesn't give n, so I must express the factors in terms of i and n, but perhaps the options are calculated for a specific n. But without knowing n, I can't compute the exact values. Hmm, maybe the given sinking fund factor can help me find n, and then proceed.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the i value. Let me think again. The question says i=5½% =4. So perhaps that's a typo, and i is 5.5%, which is 0.055, but the '=4' is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe it's i=4%, which is 0.04, but the initial part is a typo. Either way, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with i=4% because the "=4" is stated, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question intended i=5.5%, but the "=4" is a mistake. This confusion is tripping me up.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed without worrying about the i value and focus on the relationships between the factors.

I remember that the sinking fund factor is the series payment needed to accumulate a future value. The uniform-series compound amount factor (USCA) is the future value of a uniform series of payments. The formula for USCA is [(1+i)^n -1]/i. Because each payment A is compounded to the future, so the total is A * [(1+i)^n -1]/i.

Wait, but the sinking fund factor is A/F = i / [(1+i)^n -1]. So USCA is the reciprocal of the sinking fund factor multiplied by F/A. Because USCA is F/A = [(1+i)^n -1]/i. So if the sinking fund factor is A/F = 0.2303, then F/A is 1/0.2303 ≈4.3422.

So USCA would be 4.3422. Looking at the options, several have USCA as 4.3422, like option B, D, H.

Now, moving to the capital recovery factor (CR). CR is the series payment needed to pay back a present amount, considering both principal and interest. The formula is CR = i*(1+i)^n / [(1+i)^n -1]. Alternatively, it's the same as the loan repayment factor.

Wait, but how is CR related to USCA? Let me see.

USCA is the future value factor, which is [(1+i)^n -1]/i. The capital recovery factor is [i*(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n -1]. So CR is i*(1+i)^n / ( (1+i)^n -1 ). Alternatively, CR can be expressed as USCA * i / (1+i)^n * (1+i)^n? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, since USCA is [(1+i)^n -1]/i, then CR would be [i*(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n -1} ] = [i*(1+i)^n] / [ USCA * i ] = (1+i)^n / USCA.

So CR = (1+i)^n / USCA.

Wait, USCA is [(1+i)^n -1]/i. So (1+i)^n = USCA * i +1.

So CR = [ USCA * i +1 ] / USCA = 1 + (i/USCA).

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute CR using the known i and n. But I don't know n yet.

Wait, but from the USCA, which I found to be approximately 4.3422, and knowing that USCA = [(1+i)^n -1]/i, so if I have USCA and i, I can find (1+i)^n.

Let me proceed with the assumption that USCA is 4.3422, which is option B, D, H.

So USCA = [(1+i)^n -1]/i = 4.3422.

Let me use i=5.5% (0.055). Then:

(1.055)^n = 1 + (4.3422 * 0.055) = 1 + 0.238693 = 1.238693.

So (1.055)^n ≈ 1.238693.

Taking natural log:

n = ln(1.238693)/ln(1.055) ≈ (0.213)/0.0535 ≈4.0 years.

So n=4.

Alternatively, with i=4% (0.04), USCA=4.3422:

(1.04)^n =1 + (4.3422 *0.04)=1 +0.1733688=1.1733688.

Taking ln: n= ln(1.1733688)/ln(1.04) ≈0.1615/0.0392≈4.12. So n≈4.

But the options have USCA as 4.3422, which aligns with i=5.5% and n=4. So perhaps the correct i is 5.5%, and n=4.

Now, let's compute the capital recovery factor, CR.

CR formula: CR = [i*(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n -1} ].

We have (1+i)^n ≈1.238693 when i=0.055, n=4.

So CR = (0.055 * 1.238693) / (1.238693 -1) = (0.0681848) / 0.238693 ≈0.2853.

Looking at the options, let's see which have CR=0.2853.

Option D has CR=0.2853, USCA=4.3422.

Option H also has USCA=4.3422, CR=0.2853.

Now, the last factor to find is the uniform-series present-worth factor (USPW). USPW is the present value of a uniform series of payments. The formula is USPW = [1 - (1/(1+i)^n)] / i.

Since I have i=0.055 and n=4, let's compute it.

USPW = [1 - (1/1.238693)] / 0.055.

1/1.238693 ≈0.8077.

So 1 - 0.8077 = 0.1923.

0.1923 / 0.055 ≈3.496.

Looking at the options, option D has USPW=3.5021, which is close. Option H has USPW=3.5051, which is even closer. Option B has USPW=3.5051 as well.

Wait, my calculation gave approximately 3.496, but the options have 3.5021 and 3.5051. Let me compute more accurately.

Compute (1.055)^4 exactly.

1.055^1 =1.055.

1.055^2=1.055*1.055=1.113025.

1.055^3=1.113025 *1.055= let's see:

1.113025 *1.055:

1.113025 *1 =1.113025

1.113025 *0.05=0.05565125

1.113025 *0.005=0.005565125

Adding up: 1.113025 +0.05565125=1.16867625 +0.005565125=1.174241375.

So 1.055^3=1.174241375.

1.055^4=1.174241375 *1.055.

Compute that:

1.174241375 *1 =1.174241375

1.174241375 *0.05=0.05871206875

1.174241375 *0.005=0.005871206875

Adding: 1.174241375 +0.05871206875=1.23295344375 +0.005871206875=1.238824650625.

So (1.055)^4=1.238824650625.

So 1/(1.055)^4=1/1.238824650625≈0.807365.

So USPW= [1 - 0.807365]/0.055= (0.192635)/0.055≈3.503182.

So USPW≈3.503182.

Looking at the options, option B has USPW=3.5051, which is very close. Option H also has USPW=3.5051.

Wait, but earlier I calculated CR as 0.2853, which matches options D and H.

Option D has USCA=4.3422, CR=0.2853, USPW=3.5021.

Option H has USCA=4.3422, CR=0.2853, USPW=3.5051.

But my USPW calculation is approximately 3.503182, which is very close to 3.5031, but none of the options have exactly that. Option H's USPW is 3.5051, which is a bit higher. Option B has USPW=3.5051, but CR=0.2833. Wait, no, option B's CR is 0.2833, which doesn't match our CR calculation of 0.2853.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck the CR calculation.

CR = [i*(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n -1}.

We have i=0.055, (1+i)^n=1.23882465.

So numerator: 0.055 *1.23882465≈0.0681563.

Denominator:1.23882465 -1=0.23882465.

So CR≈0.0681563 /0.23882465≈0.2853.

Yes, that's correct. So CR is 0.2853.

So looking at the options, both D and H have CR=0.2853.

Now, USPW in option D is 3.5021, and in H it's 3.5051. My calculation was 3.503182.

Hmm, which is closer to 3.5031, but none of the options have that. The closest is option H with 3.5051, which is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in USPW. Let me recalculate.

USPW = [1 - 1/(1.055)^4 ] / 0.055.

We have 1/(1.055)^4≈0.807365.

So 1 - 0.807365=0.192635.

Divide by 0.055: 0.192635/0.055 ≈3.503182.

So approximately 3.50318.

Looking at the options, option C has USPW=3.5031, but its USCA is 4.3103, which doesn't match. So option C is out.

Option H has USPW=3.5051, which is a bit higher but the closest.

But wait, let's see the options again.

Option D: USCA=4.3422, CR=0.2853, USPW=3.5021.

Option H: USCA=4.3422, CR=0.2853, USPW=3.5051.

Hmm, USPW in D is 3.5021, which is very close to our calculation of ~3.50318. It's only a difference of about 0.001, which could be due to rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check which option lines up correctly.

Wait, perhaps I can check another approach. Since the sinking fund factor is given, and we have:

sinking fund factor (A/F) = 0.2303 = i / [(1+i)^n -1}.

We found USCA = (1+i)^n -1 / i = F/A =1/0.2303 ≈4.3422.

So USCA is 4.3422, which matches options B, D, H.

Capital recovery factor CR is [i*(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n -1} ].

We calculated that as 0.2853, which matches options D and H.

USPW is [1 - (1/(1+i)^n)] / i.

We calculated that as approximately 3.50318, which is closest to option H's 3.5051 and D's 3.5021.

But looking at the options, option H's USPW is 3.5051, which is 0.0019 higher than our calculation, while option D's is 0.001 lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute USPW using the exact (1.055)^4 value.

As calculated earlier, (1.055)^4=1.238824650625.

So 1/(1.238824650
