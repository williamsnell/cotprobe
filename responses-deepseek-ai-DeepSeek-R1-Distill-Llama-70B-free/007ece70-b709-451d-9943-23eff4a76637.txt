Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about mass-society theory. Hmm, I remember that mass-society theory is related to how media interacts with the public. Let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down.

The question is asking what mass-society theory suggests. The options are A through J. Let me go through each option and see which one fits.

Option A: The subordinate classes are dominated by the ruling class's ideology. That sounds a bit like the Marxist idea of cultural hegemony, where the ruling class imposes its beliefs. But is that mass-society theory? I think mass-society theory is more about the media's role in shaping the masses rather than class dominance.

Option B: Media as a platform for masses to voice opinions. That doesn't seem right. Mass-society theory, if I recall, portrays the masses as passive, not active participants. So media wouldn't be a platform but more of a one-way street.

Option C: Media manipulate the masses as vulnerable, passive consumers. This rings a bell. Mass-society theory suggests that people are part of a homogeneous mass, easily influenced by media. So the media manipulates them because they're passive.

Option D: Audiences make selective interpretations. No, that's more like the uses and gratifications theory or maybe reception theory, where audiences interpret media in their own ways. Mass-society theory is more about media influencing the audience, not the other way around.

Option E: Media content determined by market forces. That's more about media economics, like how ratings or advertisers influence content. Not directly about manipulation of the masses.

Option F: Media's sole purpose is impartial info. That's the opposite. Mass-society theory wouldn't say that; it's more about media shaping opinions, not being neutral.

Option G: Masses manipulate media through consumption. No, that would imply the audience has control, which doesn't fit with the theory. Mass-society sees the audience as passive.

Option H: Dominant classes influenced by subordinate. That's not it. It's usually the opposite; the ruling class influences the subordinate, like in cultural hegemony.

Option I: Media independent of society. No, media is definitely influenced by society, and in mass-society theory, media has a significant influence on the masses.

Option J: Content determined by government censorship. That's more about authoritarian control, not specifically mass-society theory, which is broader.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be C: the media manipulate 'the masses' as vulnerable, passive consumers.
