Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about lifespan developmental theories, specifically Baltes’s Selective Optimization with Compensation theory. Hmm, I remember that lifespan theories look at development across the entire life, from birth to old age. Baltes's theory is one of them, I think.

The question is asking what these theories suggest about development. The options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says they focus solely on early childhood experiences. Wait, no, lifespan theories cover the whole life, not just early childhood. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B is about psychopathology development. I remember that most lifespan theories are about normal development, not specifically about disorders, so B might not be right.

Option C claims it's a linear process without decline. No, I think Baltes's theory includes both growth and decline. So C is wrong.

Option D is all of the above, but since A and B are incorrect, D is out.

Option E says they're mainly about cognitive development. I think Baltes's theory covers more than just cognition. It includes emotional and social aspects too, so E might not be correct.

Option F says they only account for biological influences. No, lifespan theories consider both biological and environmental factors, so F is wrong.

Option G says development is a process of growth and decline. That sounds right because I recall that Baltes talks about optimization (gains) and compensation (dealing with losses), so both growth and decline happen.

Option H is similar to G but reverses the order. It says decline and growth. But G says growth and decline, so which one is correct? Wait, the process includes both, but the order might not matter as much as the idea that both occur. So either G or H could be correct. Hmm.

Option I says development stops after adulthood. No, lifespan theories continue into old age. So I is wrong.

Option J claims they don't account for environment. No, they do, so J is incorrect.

So narrowing down, the correct answer is either G or H. Let me think about Baltes's theory again. The theory is about selecting (focusing on certain areas), optimizing (making the most of them), and compensating (finding ways to overcome losses). So it's about how people adapt to both gains and losses over time. So development involves both growth and decline. So G says "growth (gain) and decline (loss)", which fits. H says the same but in reverse order. Wait, the way the options are phrased: G says "growth and decline", H says "decline and growth". The question is about the process described. Since both are part of the process, but the order in the option doesn't matter as much as including both. So both G and H are correct descriptions, but looking at the options, G and H are separate choices.

Wait, no, the question is about the theory suggesting that development is a process of growth and decline. So G says gain and loss, H says loss and gain. But in the theory, it's about both, so both options might be correct. Wait, but actually, the correct answer is G because the process involves both aspects together, not necessarily in a specific order. Or perhaps one of the options is more accurate.

Wait, maybe I should think about the exact wording of Baltes's theory. It's about how throughout life, there's both growth and decline. So G says "growth (gain) and decline (loss)", which seems accurate. H flips that, but I think the key is that both happen, so either could work. Wait, the options are G and H. Let me see.

Looking back, the question is about what the theories suggest. The correct answer should be G because the process includes both growth and decline, not just one after the other. So I'll choose G.

The question asks about the description of lifespan developmental theories, specifically Baltes’s Selective Optimization with Compensation theory. This theory emphasizes that development is a lifelong process involving both growth (gains) and decline (losses). It explains how individuals adapt by selecting goals, optimizing abilities, and compensating for losses. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J** are incorrect because they either misrepresent the scope of lifespan theories or exclude key aspects like environmental influences or the full lifespan.
- **G** correctly states that development is a process of growth and decline, aligning with Baltes’s theory.
- **H** is similar but reverses the order, which is less precise.

Thus, the best answer is **G**.

Answer: G
