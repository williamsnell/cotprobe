Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking how many moles are there in one atom. Hmm, I remember moles and atoms from my class, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think this through.

I think the key here is understanding the relationship between moles and atoms, which probably involves Avogadro's number. Oh right, Avogadro's number is approximately 6.022 x 10^23 particles per mole. So that's the number of atoms, molecules, or particles in one mole.

So if I have one mole of something, it contains about 6.022 x 10^23 atoms. But the question is the opposite: how many moles are in one atom? That's like flipping the ratio around.

Let me try to set this up. If 1 mole equals 6.022e23 atoms, then one atom would be 1 divided by Avogadro's number. So that's 1 / 6.022e23. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 6.022e23 is roughly 1.66e-24 moles. Wait, that sounds familiar.

Looking at the options, option E is 1.66 × 10^-24 moles. Oh, but wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. Another way to think about it is using the formula: moles = number of atoms / Avogadro's number. So for one atom, it's 1 divided by Avogadro's number.

Wait, but sometimes I get confused between moles and molecules. No, wait, in this case, it's atoms, so the same principle applies. Molar mass relates grams to moles, but this is just atoms to moles.

So yeah, one atom is 1/(6.022e23) moles, which is approximately 1.66e-24 moles. So looking at the options, E is that number. But wait, let me check each option to be sure.

Option E: 1.66 × 10^-24 moles. That's exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer should be E.

Alternatively, if I think about it, one mole has a huge number of atoms, so one atom would have a tiny fraction of a mole. So looking at the options, the only one that's a very small number is E, whereas others are either 0, 0.5, 1, or larger.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question is a trick question, like moles can't be less than one. But no, moles can be any positive number, including fractions. So yes, E makes sense.

To determine how many moles are in one atom, we use Avogadro's number, which is approximately \( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \) particles per mole. By definition, 1 mole contains \( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \) atoms. Therefore, to find the number of moles in one atom, we take the reciprocal of Avogadro's number:

\[
\text{Moles in one atom} = \frac{1}{6.022 \times 10^{23}} \approx 1.66 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{moles}.
\]

This matches option E. To confirm, moles can be a fraction, and one atom represents an extremely small fraction of a mole. Among the given options, only E (\( 1.66 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{moles} \)) aligns with this calculation.

Answer: E
