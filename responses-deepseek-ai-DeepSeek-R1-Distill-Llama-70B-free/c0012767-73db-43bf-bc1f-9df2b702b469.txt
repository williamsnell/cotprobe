Question:

The owner of a small store plans on purchasing $1,500 worth of goods to be marked up 40% based on the selling price. Of this he will have purchased $200 worth of "floor goods", which will sell for $250. If he is to maintain the desired 40% markup on the total purchase, what markup % is needed on the balance of the purchases?

Options:

A: 43.75%
B: 41%
C: 50%
D: 45%
E: 39.5%
F: 38%
G: 47.5%
H: 46.5%
I: 40%
J: 42.22%

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the store owner is buying $1,500 worth of goods. He's going to mark up everything by 40% based on the selling price. Wait, wait, I think I need to clarify what markup means here. Usually, markup can be based on cost or selling price. In this case, it's based on the selling price, right?

So, the total purchase is $1,500. Now, out of this, $200 is for "floor goods" which will sell for $250. I guess that means their cost is $200, and selling price is $250. So, what's the markup on these floor goods? Let me check: Markup is usually Selling Price minus Cost. So here, that's $250 - $200 = $50. Now, since the markup is based on selling price, the markup percentage would be (50/250)*100 = 20%. Hmm, but wait, the overall desired markup is 40%, so the floor goods are only marked up 20%, which is lower than the desired. So, the rest of the goods must have a higher markup to compensate, right?

The owner wants the total markup to be 40% on the entire purchase. So, let's see. The total cost is $1,500. The desired selling price would be cost plus 40% markup on selling price. Wait, no, when markup is based on selling price, the formula is Selling Price = Cost / (1 - Markup). Or wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of total desired selling price.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the total desired selling price first. If the total cost is $1500 and the markup is 40% on selling price, then Selling Price (Total) = Cost / (1 - Markup Rate). So Markup Rate is 40%, so 0.4. So Selling Price Total = 1500 / (1 - 0.4) = 1500 / 0.6 = $2500. So the total selling price should be $2500.

Now, the floor goods are selling for $250, which is part of this $2500. So the selling price from the floor goods is $250. Therefore, the remaining selling price needed is $2500 - $250 = $2250.

The cost of the remaining goods is total cost minus floor goods cost: $1500 - $200 = $1300. So the selling price of the remaining goods should be $2250.

Now, what's the markup percentage on these remaining goods? Since the markup is based on selling price, the formula for markup is (Selling Price - Cost) / Selling Price * 100.

So, here, Selling Price for remaining is $2250, cost is $1300. So Selling Price - Cost is $2250 - $1300 = $950.

So markup percentage is (950 / 2250) * 100. Let's compute that: 950 divided by 2250 is 0.4222... So that's 42.222...%, which is approximately 42.22%.

Looking at the options, option J is 42.22%. So the answer should be J.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the markup percentage required on the remaining goods to achieve the desired overall markup of 40% based on the selling price.

1. **Total Purchase and Desired Markup**:  
   The store owner purchases $1,500 worth of goods and wants a 40% markup based on the selling price. The total selling price required to achieve this markup is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Total Selling Price} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{1 - \text{Markup Rate}} = \frac{1500}{1 - 0.4} = \frac{1500}{0.6} = 2500
   \]

2. **Floor Goods Contribution**:  
   The floor goods cost $200 and sell for $250. Their contribution to the total selling price is $250. Therefore, the remaining selling price needed from the other goods is:  
   \[
   \text{Remaining Selling Price} = 2500 - 250 = 2250
   \]

3. **Cost of Remaining Goods**:  
   The cost of the remaining goods is:  
   \[
   \text{Remaining Cost} = 1500 - 200 = 1300
   \]

4. **Markup on Remaining Goods**:  
   The markup amount for the remaining goods is:  
   \[
   \text{Markup Amount} = \text{Remaining Selling Price} - \text{Remaining Cost} = 2250 - 1300 = 950
   \]  
   The markup percentage based on the selling price is:  
   \[
   \text{Markup Percentage} = \frac{\text{Markup Amount}}{\text{Remaining Selling Price}} \times 100 = \frac{950}{2250} \times 100 \approx 42.22\%
   \]

Thus, the required markup percentage on the remaining goods is approximately **42.22%**, which corresponds to option **J**.
