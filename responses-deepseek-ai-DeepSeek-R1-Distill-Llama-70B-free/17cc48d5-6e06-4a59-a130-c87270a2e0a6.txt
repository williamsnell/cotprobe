Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this attachment question. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about a 20-month-old child's behavior towards her mother in a new play environment. The key observations are:

1. The child clings nervously to her mother and doesn't want to explore. That makes me think she's anxious or insecure because secure children usually feel safe enough to explore their surroundings.

2. Then she suddenly pushes her mother away and doesn't engage in hugs. Pushing away seems contradictory. So she's seeking closeness but then rejecting it. That's a bit confusing.

3. Her facial expression shows anxiety, but she looks away from her mother. Avoiding eye contact might indicate some form of insecure attachment.

4. The mother turns away too. Maybe the mother's response is contributing to the child's behavior. If the mother isn't responsive, that could affect the attachment type.

Wait, I remember that attachment styles are categorized into secure and insecure, with insecure having subtypes like avoidant, resistant (or ambivalent), and disorganized-disoriented.

So secure attachment: the child explores freely, might show distress when the parent leaves, but is easily comforted upon return. That doesn't fit here because the child is clingy and anxious.

Insecure avoidant: the child shows little distress when the parent leaves and doesn't seek comfort when the parent returns. They might avoid the parent. But in this case, the child clings, so maybe not avoidant.

Insecure resistant/ambivalent: the child is clingy and anxious when the parent is present. They become very distressed when the parent leaves but then are resistant to comfort upon return. That seems closer to what's happening here. The child is clingy but then pushes the mother away when she tries to hug, which is a mix of wanting closeness and pushing it away.

Disorganized-disoriented attachment: the child shows inconsistent behaviors, maybe freezing or showing confusion. The description here doesn't mention that, so maybe not.

Looking at the options, option D is "Insecure resistant." That fits the behavior of clinging, anxiety, and pushing away when the parent tries to comfort.

Wait, another thought: the child looks away and the mother turns away. Maybe indicating that the mother isn't very responsive, which can lead to an insecure attachment. But the main issue here is the child's behavior towards the mother, which points to resistant type.

So I think the correct answer is D: Insecure resistant.

The child exhibits behaviors characteristic of an insecure resistant (ambivalent) attachment. She clings nervously to her mother, showing anxiety, but then pushes her away and resists comfort, indicating a mix of seeking closeness and rejecting it. This ambivalence aligns with the insecure resistant subtype, where children are overly dependent and distressed by separation but are also resistant to reunion attempts.

Answer: D
