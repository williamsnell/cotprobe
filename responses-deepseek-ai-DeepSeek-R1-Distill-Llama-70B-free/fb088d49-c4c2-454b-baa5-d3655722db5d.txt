Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric field intensity between two charges. Hmm, I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me think.

Alright, the problem says there are two point charges: one is +30 microcoulombs and the other is +40 microcoulombs. They are 10 cm apart in air. I need to find the electric field intensity midway between them. Oh, right, electric field from each charge will contribute, and since they're both positive, the fields might be in opposite directions.

Wait, wait, the midpoint is where I'm calculating. So each charge is 5 cm away from the midpoint. Because 10 cm apart, so half is 5 cm. Oh, but wait, I should convert that to meters because the formula uses meters. So 5 cm is 0.05 meters. Got it.

The formula for electric field from a point charge is E = k * |Q| / r², right? Where k is Coulomb's constant. I remember k is about 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². Yeah, that sounds right.

So first, I'll calculate the electric field due to each charge at the midpoint. But wait, the direction matters. Since both charges are positive, the field from each will point away from each charge. So at the midpoint between them, the field from each would be pointing in opposite directions. Wait no, wait. Let me visualize: if both are positive, then each creates a field at the midpoint that points away from themselves. So if the charges are placed along a line, say, charge 1 on the left and charge 2 on the right, the field from charge 1 at the midpoint will point to the right (since it's positive, field lines go away). The field from charge 2 at the midpoint will point to the left (because it's positive, field lines go away from it, so from midpoint, that's towards the left). Oh wait, no, wait! No, no, if the charge is on the right, the field at the midpoint (to the left of the charge) would point away, which is to the right. Wait, no, if you're to the left of a positive charge, the field points to the right. So both fields would be in the same direction? Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, wait, no, no. Let me think again. Suppose I have two positive charges, Q1 and Q2, placed a distance d apart. The midpoint is exactly in the middle. For Q1, which is on the left, the field at the midpoint would be directed to the right (since field lines go away from positive charges). For Q2, which is on the right, the field at the midpoint is directed to the left (because from the midpoint, you're to the left of Q2, so the field there points to the left). Oh wait no, no! Because the field at a point is the direction a positive test charge would move. So if you're at the midpoint, and Q2 is on the right, then the field from Q2 would push a test charge away, meaning the field would point towards the left from the midpoint. So the field from Q1 points to the right, and the field from Q2 points to the left. Therefore, they are in opposite directions.

Wait, that can't be. Because if both are positive, their fields at the midpoint would both point away from themselves, which would be towards each other? No, wait, no. Because the midpoint is between them. So Q1 is on the left, so at midpoint, field from Q1 is to the right. Q2 is on the right, so at midpoint, field from Q2 is to the left. So they are opposite. So the net field would be the difference between the two.

Wait, no, wait another way: let's imagine two positive charges a distance apart. The field from each at the midpoint would push a positive test charge away. So from Q1 (left), the field at the midpoint is to the right. From Q2 (right), the field at the midpoint is to the left. So the fields are in opposite directions. So the net field is the sum of the magnitudes, but considering their directions.

Wait, but wait, if both are positive, the fields they produce at the midpoint would be in opposite directions. So the net field would be the difference between the two. Let me clarify with an example. Suppose Q1 is larger than Q2. Then, the field from Q1 would be stronger than that from Q2. So the net field would point in the direction of the stronger field.

Wait, but in our case, Q1 is 30 microcoulombs, and Q2 is 40. So Q2 is larger. So the field from Q2 at the midpoint will be stronger than that from Q1. So the net field at the midpoint would be the field from Q2 (to the left) minus the field from Q1 (to the right). Or wait, actually, the directions are opposite, so it's the difference between the two in magnitude.

Wait, perhaps I should just calculate the magnitudes and then see which one is bigger and subtract, but considering their directions.

So let's proceed.

First, convert the charges to coulombs. 30 microcoulombs is 30e-6 C. 40 microcoulombs is 40e-6 C.

The distance from each charge to the midpoint is 0.05 meters.

Compute E1 (from Q1) and E2 (from Q2).

E1 = k * Q1 / r²
E2 = k * Q2 / r²

Since r is the same for both (0.05 m), and k is same, E1 and E2 will be proportional to Q1 and Q2 respectively.

Calculating each:

E1 = (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (30e-6 C) / (0.05 m)^2
E2 = (8.988e9) * (40e-6) / (0.05)^2

Compute denominators first: 0.05^2 = 0.0025 m².

So,

E1 = 8.988e9 * 30e-6 / 0.0025
E2 = 8.988e9 * 40e-6 / 0.0025

Let me compute each step.

First, compute the numerator for E1: 8.988e9 * 30e-6 = ?

30e-6 is 3e-5.

8.988e9 * 3e-5 = (8.988 * 3) * 1e4 = 26.964 * 1e4 = 2.6964e5.

Then, divide by 0.0025: 2.6964e5 / 0.0025.

Dividing by 0.0025 is same as multiplying by 400. So 2.6964e5 * 400 = 2.6964e5 *4e2 = 2.6964e7 N/C.

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 0.0025 is 2.5e-3. So 1/0.0025 = 400.

So E1 = (8.988e9 * 30e-6) / 0.0025 = (8.988e9 * 30e-6) * (1/0.0025)

Let me compute this as:

Compute 8.988e9 * 30e-6 first.

8.988e9 = 8.988 x 1e9

30e-6 = 30 x 1e-6 = 3e-5.

Multiply them: 8.988e9 * 3e-5 = (8.988 *3) x 1e4 = 26.964 x 1e4 = 2.6964e5.

Then divide by 0.0025 (same as multiply by 400):

2.6964e5 * 400 = 2.6964e5 * 4e2 = (2.6964 *4) x 1e7 = 10.7856 x 1e7 = 1.07856e8 N/C.

Wait, that can't be right because 2.6964e5 *400 is 1.07856e8, yes.

So E1 is approximately 1.07856e8 N/C.

Similarly, E2 = (8.988e9 *40e-6) / 0.0025.

Compute 8.988e9 *40e-6: 8.988e9 *4e-5 = (8.988 *4) x 1e4 = 35.952 x 1e4 = 3.5952e5.

Then divide by 0.0025: 3.5952e5 *400 = 3.5952e5 *4e2 = (3.5952 *4) x 1e7 = 14.3808 x 1e7 = 1.43808e8 N/C.

Wait, so E1 is about 1.0786e8 N/C to the right, and E2 is about 1.43808e8 N/C to the left.

Because the fields are in opposite directions, the net field is E2 (left) minus E1 (right). Because E2 is larger, the net direction is to the left.

So net E = E2 - E1 = (1.43808e8) - (1.07856e8) = 0.35952e8 N/C. Which is 3.5952e7 N/C. That's 36.0 x 1e6 N/C. Wait, 3.5952e7 is 35.952e6, which is approximately 36 x 1e6 N/C.

Looking at the options, option E is 36 × 10^6 N/C. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I get the directions right? Because if both are positive, the fields at the midpoint would be in opposite directions, so the net is the difference. So that part is correct.

Yes, the calculation seems right. So the answer is E.

To compute the electric field intensity midway between two point charges, we start by noting the charges and their separation. Charge 1 is \( Q_1 = +30 \, \mu\text{C} = 30 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C} \), and Charge 2 is \( Q_2 = +40 \, \mu\text{C} = 40 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{C} \). The charges are separated by \( d = 10 \, \text{cm} = 0.1 \, \text{m} \), so the midpoint is \( r = 0.05 \, \text{m} \) from each charge.

The electric field due to a point charge is given by:

\[
E = \frac{k |Q|}{r^2}
\]

where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) is Coulomb's constant. Since both charges are positive, their fields at the midpoint point in opposite directions. Thus, the net field is the difference between the magnitudes of the two fields.

### Step 1: Calculate \( E_1 \) (field from \( Q_1 \))
\[
E_1 = \frac{k Q_1}{r^2}
\]
Substituting values:
\[
E_1 = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(30 \times 10^{-6})}{(0.05)^2}
\]
\[
E_1 = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(30 \times 10^{-6})}{0.0025}
\]
First, compute the numerator:
\[
(8.988 \times 10^9)(30 \times 10^{-6}) = 2.6964 \times 10^5
\]
Then divide by \( 0.0025 \):
\[
E_1 = \frac{2.6964 \times 10^5}{0.0025} = 1.07856 \times 10^8 \, \text{N/C}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( E_2 \) (field from \( Q_2 \))
\[
E_2 = \frac{k Q_2}{r^2}
\]
Substituting values:
\[
E_2 = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(40 \times 10^{-6})}{(0.05)^2}
\]
\[
E_2 = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(40 \times 10^{-6})}{0.0025}
\]
First, compute the numerator:
\[
(8.988 \times 10^9)(40 \times 10^{-6}) = 3.5952 \times 10^5
\]
Then divide by \( 0.0025 \):
\[
E_2 = \frac{3.5952 \times 10^5}{0.0025} = 1.43808 \times 10^8 \, \text{N/C}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the net field
At the midpoint, the fields from \( Q_1 \) and \( Q_2 \) point in opposite directions. Thus, the net field is:
\[
E_{\text{net}} = E_2 - E_1
\]
Substituting values:
\[
E_{\text{net}} = 1.43808 \times 10^8 - 1.07856 \times 10^8
\]
\[
E_{\text{net}} = 0.35952 \times 10^8 \, \text{N/C}
\]
\[
E_{\text{net}} = 3.5952 \times 10^7 \, \text{N/C}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The closest option to \( 3.5952 \times 10^7 \, \text{N/C} \) is \( 36 \times 10^6 \, \text{N/C} \), which corresponds to **option E**.
