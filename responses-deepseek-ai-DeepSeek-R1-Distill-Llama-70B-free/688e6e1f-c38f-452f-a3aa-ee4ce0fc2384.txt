Question:

Which of these statements cannot be applied to the initial development of peace studies?

Options:

A: Peace studies was initially not recognized as a legitimate academic discipline.
B: The initial development of peace studies was greatly influenced by the political climate of the Cold War era.
C: Mathematicians and natural scientists entered the field, which was otherwise a social-sciences area of study, adding to the interdisciplinary nature of the field.
D: The field of peace studies was initially developed by historians and anthropologists.
E: Most early work was carried out in North America and Scandinavia.
F: Early peace studies were primarily conducted by government agencies.
G: The establishment of research institutes across the world has been one of the lasting successes of peace studies.
H: Now of fundamental importance to peace studies as a field of research, the creation of journals was not a prominent feature of the peace studies until late in the twentieth century.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out which statement can't be applied to the initial development of peace studies. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says peace studies wasn't initially recognized as a legitimate academic discipline. I think that's true because a lot of new fields face skepticism. So maybe this is a correct statement about the initial development, so it can be applied, meaning it's not the answer we're looking for.

Option B mentions the Cold War's influence. The Cold War was a big deal, and I remember reading that it influenced a lot of academic fields, including peace studies. So B is applicable and not the answer.

Option C talks about mathematicians and natural scientists joining, adding to the interdisciplinary nature. That makes sense because peace studies is interdisciplinary, combining social sciences with other fields. So C is a valid point and applicable, not the answer.

Option D says the field was initially developed by historians and anthropologists. Wait, I thought peace studies started more with social sciences and maybe even some input from natural sciences. Historians and anthropologists might have contributed, but were they the initial developers? Or was it more from political science, sociology, etc.? Maybe D is not correct. I'm a bit unsure here.

Option E states that early work was done in North America and Scandinavia. I've heard that Scandinavia, especially Norway, was a hub for peace research, and North America too. So E is applicable, not the answer.

Option F claims early studies were conducted by government agencies. From what I know, a lot of early peace research was done in academic settings or NGOs, not primarily by governments. So F might be the incorrect statement. But I'm not certain. Maybe some government funding, but not primarily conducted by them.

Option G says the establishment of research institutes was a success. I think that's true. Institutes like the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) are well-known, so G is applicable.

Option H mentions that journals weren't prominent until late in the 20th century. I think early on, the field was establishing itself, so maybe journals came later. So H is a correct statement and applicable.

So narrowing it down, the question is which statement cannot be applied. So the incorrect statements would be the ones that are false about the initial development.

Option D: If the initial development was by historians and anthropologists, but I think it was more from political scientists, sociologists, maybe even economists. Historians and anthropologists might have contributed, but perhaps weren't the initial developers. So D might not be applicable.

Option F: If early work wasn't done by government agencies, then F is incorrect. But I'm not sure. Maybe some were, but not primarily. So which is more incorrect?

Alternatively, if D is incorrect because the initial development wasn't by historians and anthropologists, then D is the answer. Or if F is incorrect because it wasn't primarily government agencies.

Wait, the question is which statement cannot be appliedâ€”meaning it's not true about the initial development.

I think F is the incorrect one. Because early peace studies were more from academia and NGOs, not primarily government agencies. So F can't be applied, making it the correct answer. But I'm a bit confused because I'm not certain about this.

Alternatively, D says it was developed by historians and anthropologists. If the initial field was more interdisciplinary with social sciences, perhaps including political science, sociology, etc., but maybe not primarily historians and anthropologists. So D might be the incorrect statement.

I'm a bit stuck between D and F. Let me think again.

Peace studies as an academic field emerged in the mid-20th century, influenced by the Cold War. It drew from various disciplines, including political science, sociology, economics, but also natural sciences. Historians and anthropologists probably contributed, but were they the initial developers? Maybe not the primary ones. So D might be the incorrect statement.

Wait, another angle: the initial development was more in social sciences, so maybe historians and anthropologists weren't the main founders. So D can't be applied, making it the answer.

Alternatively, F says early work was by government agencies. If that's not true, then F is the incorrect statement.

I think I need to choose between D and F.

I think F is more likely to be incorrect because early peace studies were more academic and not government-driven. So F is the statement that cannot be applied.

Wait, but the options are about which cannot be applied. So the incorrect statement is the one that's false.

So the answer would be either D or F.

Alternatively, maybe the initial development involved more than just social sciences, but I'm not sure about historians being the initial developers.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the initial development was not by historians and anthropologists, but by other social scientists. So D is incorrect.

But I'm not entirely certain. I think I'll go with F as the answer because government agencies weren't the primary conductors of early peace studies.

To determine which statement cannot be applied to the initial development of peace studies, let's analyze each option:

- **A**: Peace studies was initially not recognized as a legitimate academic discipline. This is true, as many new fields face skepticism. Therefore, this statement can be applied.  
- **B**: The initial development of peace studies was influenced by the Cold War era. This is correct, as the Cold War significantly impacted the emergence of peace studies. Hence, this statement is applicable.  
- **C**: Mathematicians and natural scientists contributed to the interdisciplinary nature of peace studies. This is accurate, as peace studies drew from diverse fields. Thus, this statement applies.  
- **D**: The field was initially developed by historians and anthropologists. This is questionable. While historians and anthropologists contributed, the initial development was more driven by social sciences like political science and sociology. This makes D potentially inapplicable.  
- **E**: Early work was carried out in North America and Scandinavia. This is true, as these regions were hubs for peace research. Therefore, this statement applies.  
- **F**: Early peace studies were primarily conducted by government agencies. This is unlikely, as early work was more academic and NGO-driven. Thus, F is likely inapplicable.  
- **G**: The establishment of research institutes was a lasting success. This is true, as institutes like PRIO are well-known. Hence, this statement applies.  
- **H**: Journals were not prominent until late in the 20th century. This is correct, as the field took time to establish academic journals. Therefore, this statement applies.  

Between **D** and **F**, **F** is more clearly inapplicable, as early peace studies were not primarily conducted by government agencies.  

Answer: F
