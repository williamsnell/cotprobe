Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what it's asking. The question is about events where groups of sellers meet collectively to attract buyers. Hmm, I think I remember something about this from my marketing classes.

The options are A through J, with various marketing-related terms. Let's go through them one by one. 

Option A: Direct mail campaigns. I know direct mail is when companies send letters or brochures directly to potential customers. That's more one-on-one and not a group event, so probably not the answer.

Option B: Teleconferencing. That's when people meet over the phone or internet. Sellers might use it for meetings, but it doesn't involve meeting in person collectively to attract buyers. So maybe not B.

Option C: Sales promotions. Sales promotions are short-term incentives to boost sales, like discounts or free samples. They can be part of events, but I'm not sure if this is the specific answer they're looking for.

Option D: Public relations activities. PR involves managing the company's image and communications, maybe through press releases or events. But it's more about image than bringing sellers together to meet buyers.

Option E: Press conference. This is where a company invites the media to make announcements. It's a gathering, but it's more for media exposure rather than a collective seller-buyer meeting.

Option F: Mass media advertising. That's using TV, radio, newspapers to reach a large audience. It's a broad approach, not a specific event where sellers meet.

Option G: Product launches. These are events to introduce new products. They can be big events, but they're usually specific to one company or product line, not a collective of sellers.

Option H: Market research. This is about gathering data on customers and markets. Not an event where sellers meet buyers.

Option I: Exhibitions. Oh, wait, exhibitions or trade shows are events where multiple sellers gather to showcase their products to potential buyers. That sounds exactly like what the question is describing. I think this is the right choice.

Option J: Social media campaigns. That's using platforms like Facebook or Twitter to promote products. It's digital and not a physical meeting event.

So putting it all together, the question is about events where groups of sellers meet to attract buyers. Exhibitions fit perfectly because they're places like trade shows where many sellers set up booths to meet and attract buyers. So the answer should be I.

The correct answer is I: Exhibitions.
