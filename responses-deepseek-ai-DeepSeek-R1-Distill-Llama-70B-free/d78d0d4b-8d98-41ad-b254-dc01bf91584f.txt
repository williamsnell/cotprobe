Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the Hohokam people and what practice they borrowed from Mesoamerican culture. I remember that the Hohokam were an ancient Native American culture in what's now the southern part of Arizona, right? They were known for their irrigation systems and trade networks.

The question gives me several options, from A to H. I need to think about each one and see which makes the most sense. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Use of a calendar system based on celestial bodies. I know that many Mesoamerican cultures, like the Aztecs and Mayans, had sophisticated calendars. The Hohokam might have had some calendar system too, but I'm not sure if this is what they borrowed. I think they had their own agricultural cycles, but maybe they adopted some Mesoamerican timekeeping methods. Not certain, but I'll keep this in mind.

Option B: Practice of mummification for the dead. Mummification is more commonly associated with ancient Egypt and some South American cultures like the Chinchorro. Mesoamericans didn't really mummify their dead as far as I remember. So I don't think this is the right answer.

Option C: Ritual consumption of maize beer. Maize was a staple crop in Mesoamerica, and they did make alcoholic beverages from it. I think the Hohokam also used maize, so maybe they adopted this practice. But I'm not sure how significant this is compared to other options.

Option D: Construction of underground dwellings. I'm not sure about this. Maybe some cultures built underground, but I don't recall the Hohokam being known for that. They had above-ground structures, I think. So probably not D.

Option E: Ritual human sacrifice. This is a big one. Mesoamericans, especially the Aztecs, were known for human sacrifice. But the Hohokam? I don't remember hearing that they practiced human sacrifice. They might have had some rituals, but I don't think they went that far. So E might not be correct.

Option F: Use of cacao in religious ceremonies. Cacao was important in Mesoamerica, used to make chocolate which was a luxury item and used in rituals. The Hohokam were in the southwest, but I'm not sure if cacao use spread that far north. Maybe through trade, but I'm not certain. I'll have to think about this.

Option G: Playing ritual ball games. Oh, right! Mesoamerica had these ball courts where they played games that were both sport and ritual. I think the Hohokam adopted this. They built ball courts similar to those in Mesoamerica. So this seems like a strong possibility.

Option H: Construction of stepped pyramids. Stepped pyramids were a feature of Mesoamerican architecture, like the Aztec Templo Mayor. Did the Hohokam build anything like that? I'm not sure. They had platform mounds, but I don't recall if they were stepped like in Mesoamerica. Maybe not as much.

So, putting it all together. I remember that the Hohokam had ball courts, which were likely influenced by Mesoamerican cultures. So option G is probably the correct answer. Other options like the calendar or cacao might have some truth, but the ball games are a more direct and well-known borrowing.

The Hohokam people, located in what is now southern Arizona, were known for their advanced irrigation systems and extensive trade networks. Among the practices they borrowed from Mesoamerican culture, the most notable is the adoption of ritual ball games. Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the Aztecs and Mayans, had a long tradition of playing these games on ball courts, which served both as a sport and a ritual. Archaeological evidence shows that the Hohokam constructed similar ball courts, indicating a direct influence from Mesoamerican traditions.

Other options, such as the use of a calendar system (A) or the use of cacao (F), may have some merit but are less directly supported by evidence. Practices like mummification (B), human sacrifice (E), and stepped pyramids (H) were not characteristic of the Hohokam. Therefore, the most well-documented and significant borrowing is the ritual ball games.

Answer: G
