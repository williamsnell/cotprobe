Okay, so I need to figure out the key characteristics of transactional leaders. Hmm, I remember that leadership styles are a common topic in management and psychology classes. Let me try to recall what I know about transactional leadership.

From what I learned, transactional leadership is one of the leadership styles identified, probably alongside transformational leadership. I think transactional leaders focus on exchanges between the leader and the followers. Like, they set clear goals and expectations, and in return, they offer rewards or punishments based on performance.

Wait, so transactional leaders are more about guidance and structure. They probably have a top-down approach. So their key characteristics would involve guiding their team, right? Because they set the rules and expectations.

I also remember that transactional leadership often involves motivating through rewards. So they might command their team, give instructions, and ensure that tasks are completed as per the plan. So maybe characteristics like commanding and motivating are part of it.

Looking at the options, I need to pick the combination that includes guiding, commanding, and motivating. Let me go through the options:

Option A: Guiding, demonstrating, motivating. Hmm, demonstrating isn't ringing a bell for transactional leaders. More like transformational, where leaders model behavior.

Option B: Guiding, commanding, motivating. This seems to fit. They guide, they give commands (since they're more directive), and they motivate through rewards.

Option C: Demonstrating, mentoring, guiding. Again, demonstrating sounds more like transformational.

Option D: Guiding, mentoring, motivating. Mentoring also feels more like a transformational approach, where leaders develop their followers.

Option E: Mentoring, demonstrating, commanding. Doesn't sound right for transactional.

Option F: Demonstrating, commanding, guiding. Demonstrating again points elsewhere.

Option G: Guiding, commanding, demonstrating. Same issue as F.

Option H: Commanding, mentoring, motivating. Mentoring still doesn't fit transactional.

Option I: Commanding, demonstrating, motivating. Demonstrating again is off.

Option J: Guiding, mentoring, demonstrating. No, same problem.

So the correct option should be B: Guiding, commanding, and motivating.

The key characteristics of transactional leaders include guiding their team, providing clear instructions, and motivating through rewards or recognition. They operate on a system of exchanges, where followers are directed to meet specific goals. Among the options, the combination of guiding, commanding, and motivating aligns best with transactional leadership. 

Answer: B
