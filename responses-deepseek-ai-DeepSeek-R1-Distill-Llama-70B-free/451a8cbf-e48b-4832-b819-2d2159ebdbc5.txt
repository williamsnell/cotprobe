Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about two image datasets: ImageNet and Caltech-101. The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate whether each is true or false, then choose the correct option from A to J. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I'll look at Statement 1: "ImageNet has images of various resolutions." Hmm, I remember that ImageNet is a pretty large dataset, commonly used for training deep learning models like CNNs. I think it's known for having a lot of images, maybe even a million or more. But wait, do these images come in different resolutions? From what I recall, ImageNet images are usually preprocessed to a fixed size because many models require a consistent input size. So maybe they're all resized to, say, 224x224 pixels. But wait, is that always the case? Or does ImageNet store the images in their original resolutions and let the users handle resizing? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think some datasets keep images at their original size, while others resize them. Since ImageNet is used for classification tasks where resizing is common, I'm leaning towards thinking that the images are of various resolutions originally but might be resized for model training. So Statement 1 is probably true because the dataset includes images of different sizes.

Now, Statement 2: "Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet." Okay, I'm a bit unsure about the exact numbers here. Caltech-101 is another dataset I've heard about. I think it's smaller compared to ImageNet. ImageNet has a huge number of images, like around 14 million, I believe. Caltech-101, on the other hand, has about 101 categories with a few hundred images each. So total images would be maybe around 9,000 or so? That's way less than ImageNet. So Statement 2 is definitely false because ImageNet has way more images.

Wait, wait, but wait another second. Maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me think again. Caltech-101 has 101 categories, each with about 40 to 800 images, but I think the total is around 9,000 images. ImageNet, as I recall, has around 14 million images. So yes, Caltech-101 has fewer images than ImageNet. So Statement 2 is false.

So putting it together: Statement 1 is True, and Statement 2 is False. Looking back at the options, option B says True, False. So the answer should be B.

The correct evaluation of the statements is as follows: 

- **Statement 1**: ImageNet contains images of various resolutions. This is true because ImageNet includes images in their original resolutions, even though they are often resized for specific tasks. 

- **Statement 2**: Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet. This is false because ImageNet has approximately 14 million images, while Caltech-101 has around 9,000 images.

Thus, the correct answer is **B: True, False**.
