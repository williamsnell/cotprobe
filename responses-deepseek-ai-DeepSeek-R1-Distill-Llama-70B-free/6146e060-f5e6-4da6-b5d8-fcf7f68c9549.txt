Question:

The premium rate on homeowners insurance for the ABC Insurance Company is $.96 per $100. In addition, ABC allows a discount of 20% of the premium if the homeowner accepts a policy containing a $250 deductible clause. Calculate the premium for a homeowners policy for $27,000 containing a $250 deductible clause.

Options:

A: $51.84
B: $220
C: $184.80
D: $259.20
E: $145.20
F: $207
G: $246.40
H: $102
I: $123.84
J: $165.60

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about calculating the premium for a homeowner's insurance policy with a deductible clause. Hmm, I remember that insurance premiums can have rates and discounts, so I'll need to break this down.

First, the premium rate is $0.96 per $100 of coverage. The policy is for $27,000. So I think I need to calculate the base premium first. How do I do that? Well, the rate is per $100, so I guess I need to find out how many $100 units are in $27,000.

Wait, $27,000 divided by $100 is 270. So 270 units. Then, multiply by the rate of $0.96. Let me compute that: 270 * 0.96. Let me do 270 * 1 = 270, so 0.96 is 4% less than 1. So 4% of 270 is, let's see, 10% is 27, so 4% is 10.8. So 270 - 10.8 equals 259.2. So the base premium is $259.20.

But wait, there's a discount. ABC allows a 20% discount if the homeowner accepts a $250 deductible. Oh right, so I need to apply this discount to the base premium.

So the base is $259.20, and the discount is 20%. How do I calculate 20% of 259.20? Let me think: 10% is 25.92, so 20% is double that, which is 51.84. So the discount is $51.84.

Now, subtract the discount from the base premium to get the final premium. So 259.20 minus 51.84. Let me do that calculation. 259.20 - 50 is 209.20, then subtract another 1.84, which gives 207.36. Wait, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. 270 * 0.96 is 259.20. That's correct. Then 20% of 259.20 is 51.84. So subtract 51.84 from 259.20. Let me compute 259.20 minus 51.84. 259.20 minus 50 is 209.20, then minus 1.84 is 207.36. Wait, but looking at the options, option F is $207, which is close. But wait, 207.36 is more precise, but perhaps the options round it down. Or maybe I did something wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is applied differently. Wait, maybe I should calculate 80% of the base premium instead of subtracting 20%. Let's try that. 80% is the same as 0.8. So 259.20 multiplied by 0.8. 200 * 0.8 is 160, 50 * 0.8 is 40, 9.2 * 0.8 is 7.36. Wait, no, better to compute 259.20 * 0.8.

Well, 259.20 times 0.8: 200 * 0.8 is 160, 50 *0.8 is 40, so 160+40=200. Then 9.2 *0.8 is 7.36. So 200 +7.36=207.36. So same result.

So the final premium is $207.36. Looking at the options, F is $207, which is close. But wait, maybe the question expects us to round to the nearest dollar, so 207.36 becomes 207. So the answer would be F.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A: $51.84

B: $220

C: $184.80

D: $259.20

E: $145.20

F: $207

G: $246.40

H: $102

I: $123.84

J: $165.60

So F is $207. The exact calculation is $207.36, which is approximately $207.36, so F would be the correct choice. Wait, but wait another thing. Alternatively, perhaps the base calculation is different. Maybe the rate is per $100, but perhaps the coverage is $27,000, so the calculation is 27,000 * (0.96/100), which would be 27,000 * 0.0096.

Wait, that's another way to compute it. Let me try: 27,000 * 0.0096. Let's compute that. 27,000 * 0.01 is 270. So 0.0096 is 0.96 * 0.01, so 0.96 * 270. Oh wait, that's the same as before, which gives 259.20. So that's correct.

So the base is 259.20, discount 20%, which is 51.84 off, giving 207.36, which rounds to 207, option F. So that seems to be the correct answer.

The base premium is calculated by multiplying the coverage amount ($27,000) by the rate ($0.96 per $100). This gives:

\[
\text{Base Premium} = 270 \times 0.96 = \$259.20
\]

Next, a 20% discount is applied to the base premium. The discount amount is:

\[
\text{Discount} = 0.20 \times 259.20 = \$51.84
\]

Subtracting the discount from the base premium:

\[
\text{Final Premium} = 259.20 - 51.84 = \$207.36
\]

Since the question likely rounds to the nearest dollar, the final premium is approximately \$207. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**F: $207**
