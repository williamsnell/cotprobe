Okay, so I've got this problem about convective heat transfer and boundary layer stuff. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when a fluid flows over a flat plate, we can calculate various properties like the heat transfer coefficient, friction, drag, and boundary layer thickness. The question gives me air at 100°F flowing at 20 fps over a flat plate that's 200°F and 2 ft wide. I need to find these values at x=2 ft.

First, I think I should determine the Reynolds number because a lot of these properties depend on that. Reynolds number (Re) is (velocity * length) / kinematic viscosity. But wait, I need the kinematic viscosity of air at 100°F. I think at around 100°F, air's viscosity is something like 0.0000167 slug/ft²·s, and density is about 0.0763 slug/ft³. So kinematic viscosity (ν) is viscosity divided by density. Let me calculate that: ν = 0.0000167 / 0.0763 ≈ 2.19e-4 ft²/s.

Wait, the film temperature for properties might be the average of the air and plate temperatures. Oh wait, the plate is 200°F, and the air is 100°F. So film temp T_film is (200 + 100)/2 = 150°F. I should use properties at 150°F. Let me check the values again. At 150°F, the kinematic viscosity might be a bit higher. I'm not exactly sure, but maybe ν is around 0.225 ft²/s? Wait, no, I think I'm mixing units. Let me think again: more accurately, the kinematic viscosity of air at 100°F is about 0.0000173 slug/ft-s² divided by density of 0.0763 slug/ft³ gives ν ≈ 0.0000173 / 0.0763 ≈ 2.27e-4 ft²/s. At 150°F, ν increases. Maybe I should look up the exact value, but since I don't have that, I'll proceed with ν ≈ 0.225 * 1e-4, no, wait, maybe ν is about 0.225 * 1e-4 ft²/s? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, 2.27e-4 is 0.000227 ft²/s. So I'll go with that for calculations.

So the Reynolds number Re = (V * x) / ν. V is 20 ft/s, x is 2 ft. So Re = (20 * 2) / 0.000227 ≈ 40 / 0.000227 ≈ 176,000, roughly 1.76e5. Okay, so laminar flow is up to Re ~ 5e5, so this is still laminar flow, I think.

Now, for the local convective heat transfer coefficient (h), I remember that for laminar flow over a flat plate, the Nusselt number (Nu) is 0.332 * Pr^(1/3) * Re^(1/2), where Pr is the Prandtl number. The Pr for air is around 0.7, I think. So Pr^(1/3) is 0.7^(1/3) ≈ 0.887.

So Nu = 0.332 * 0.887 * sqrt(Re). Re is 1.76e5, so sqrt(Re) is sqrt(176000) ≈ 419.58. So Nu ≈ 0.332 * 0.887 * 419.58 ≈ Let's compute that step by step. 0.332 * 0.887 is about 0.294. Then 0.294 * 419.58 ≈ 123.6. So Nu is approximately 123.6.

Nu is also h * x / k, where k is thermal conductivity. So h = Nu * k / x. I need k for air at T_film, which is 150°F. Thermal conductivity of air at around 150°F is about 0.015 Btu/hr·ft·°F. So k ≈ 0.015.

So h = (123.6 * 0.015) / 2. Because x is 2 ft. Wait, no: h = (Nu * k) / x. So (123.6 * 0.015) / 2 = (1.854) / 2 ≈ 0.927 Btu/hr·ft²·°F. But wait, looking at the options, the h values are around 0.9 to 1.6. So 0.927 is around 0.93, which is option E's 1.3? No, wait, E is 1.3, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the numbers. Maybe I should get the exact Prandtl number. Let me see, at 150°F, the Prandtl number for air is about 0.68. So Pr^(1/3) is 0.68^(1/3) ≈ 0.88. So that part was about right.

Wait, perhaps the kinematic viscosity is different. If I'm using ν at 150°F, maybe it's higher than I thought. Let me think: At 100°F, ν for air is about 0.0000173 slug/ft-s² divided by 0.0763 slug/ft³ gives 2.27e-4 ft²/s. At 150°F, ν increases. Let me see, maybe ν ≈ 0.000020 slug/(ft²·s) divided by 0.065 slug/ft³ (density at 150°F) would give ν = 0.000020 / 0.065 ≈ 3.08e-4 ft²/s. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to use the viscosity and density at the film temperature.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the properties at 150°F. Air at 150°F (about 65.5°C) has:

- Viscosity μ ≈ 0.0000185 slug/ft·s
- Density ρ ≈ 0.072 lbm/ft³ (but wait, 1 slug = 32.174 lbm, so 0.072 lbm/ft³ = 0.072 / 32.174 ≈ 0.00224 slug/ft³). So ν = μ/ρ = 0.0000185 / 0.00224 ≈ 0.00000826 ft²/s, which is 8.26e-6 ft²/s. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because earlier I thought ν was about 2e-4 at 100°F, but maybe at higher temps, it's higher. Hmm, maybe I should double-check these values more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me try again. Density of air at 150°F is about 0.072 lbm/ft³. Since 1 lbm is 0.03125 slug (because 1 slug is 32.174 lbm), so 0.072 lbm/ft³ = 0.072 * 0.03125 ≈ 0.00225 slug/ft³.

Viscosity at 150°F is about 0.0000185 lbm/(ft·s). To convert to slug units, since 1 lbm = 0.03125 slug, so μ = 0.0000185 * 0.03125 ≈ 5.781e-7 slug/(ft·s).

So ν = μ / ρ = (5.781e-7) / 0.00225 ≈ 2.57e-4 ft²/s.

Ah, okay, so ν is about 2.57e-4 ft²/s at 150°F. So Re = (V x) / ν = 20 * 2 / 2.57e-4 ≈ 40 / 0.000257 ≈ 155,748. So Re ≈ 1.55e5.

Now, recalculating Nu: 0.332 * (Pr)^(1/3) * (Re)^(1/2). Pr at 150°F is around 0.68, so Pr^(1/3) ≈ 0.88. Re^(1/2) is sqrt(155748) ≈ 394.6.

So Nu = 0.332 * 0.88 * 394.6 ≈ 0.332 * 0.88 = 0.292; 0.292 * 394.6 ≈ 115.2. So Nu ≈ 115.2.

Thermal conductivity k at 150°F is about 0.015 Btu/hr·ft·°F. So h = (Nu * k) / x = (115.2 * 0.015) / 2. Let's compute that: 115.2 * 0.015 = 1.728. Then 1.728 / 2 = 0.864 Btu/hr·ft²·°F. So h ≈ 0.864. Looking at the options, option E has h=1.3, which is higher. Option J is 0.9. Hmm, my calculation is 0.864, which is close to 0.86 or 0.87. But none of the options exactly match this; let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: h=1.6

Option B: h=1.5

Option C: h=1.4

Option D: h=1.2

Option E: h=1.3

Option F: h=1.0

Option G: h=0.95

Option H: h=0.8

Option I: h=1.09

Option J: h=0.9

Hmm, 0.864 is closest to option I (1.09) no, wait, no, 0.864 is about 0.86, so closer to option G (0.95) or option J (0.9). Wait, 0.864 is just under 0.87, so 0.86 would be option G is 0.95, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should use a better approximation for Prandtl number. Alternatively, maybe I should consider more precise values for the properties. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses Re as (V x)/(ν), which I think I did correctly.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Oh wait, the formula for Nu is 0.332 * Pr^(1/3) * Re^(1/2) [for laminar flow], which I think I did right.

So h is 0.864 Btu/hr ft² °F. Looking at the options, none exactly match, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses different properties.

Wait, maybe the problem uses the air properties at 100°F instead of the film temperature. Let me try that. So, if T_film is (T_air + T_plate)/2 = (100+200)/2 = 150°F. So I think using 150°F properties is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that for air, Pr is around 0.7, as I did earlier. Let me recalculate with more precise numbers.

Pr = 0.7 → Pr^(1/3) ≈ 0.887. Re = 155,748 → Re^(1/2) ≈ 394.6.

So Nu = 0.332 * 0.887 * 394.6 = 0.332 * 0.887 ≈ 0.2942. 0.2942 * 394.6 ≈ 116. So Nu ≈ 116.

So h = (116 * 0.015) / 2 = (1.74)/2 = 0.87 Btu/hr ft² °F. So h≈0.87. Looking at the options, option J has h=0.9, which is the closest. So perhaps the correct option is J, but let's see the other parameters.

Wait, the question also asks for the rate of heat transfer. The formula is Q = h * A * ΔT. The area A is the area of the plate up to x=2 ft, so it's width * length. The plate is 2 ft wide, and length x=2 ft, so area A = 2 ft * 2 ft =4 ft². ΔT is T_plate - T_air = 200-100=100°F.

So Q = 0.87 * 4 * 100 = 0.87 * 400 = 348 Btu/hr. But looking at the options, none have 348. So maybe my h is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should check for the correct formula. Oh wait, the formula for h is (k * Nu) / x. So if x is 2 ft, then h= (0.015 * 116) / 2 = 1.74 / 2 = 0.87.

But the heat transfer rate is h * A * ΔT. A is the area, which for a flat plate of width w and length x, A = w * x. So w is 2 ft, x is 2 ft, so A=4 ft². So Q=0.87 *4 *100=348. But the options don't have 348. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the width is 2 ft, but the length is x=2 ft, so the area is 2*2=4, correct. So the options' Q values are like 52,000 in option E. Wait, wait, no: looking back, the options for Q are in the range of thousands, like 64,000, 60,000, etc. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, looking again, option A's Q is 64,000 Btu/hr, which is way higher than my 348. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Oh wait, perhaps the plate is very long, and the 2 ft is the length, but perhaps the width is 2 ft, so the area is 2 ft (width) * 2 ft (length) =4 ft². So with h=0.87 and ΔT=100, Q=0.87*4*100=348. But the options are way higher. So I'm definitely missing something.

Ah! Wait a second, perhaps the problem is using the entire plate's width as the length in the Reynolds number. Or perhaps the plate's width is 2 ft, but the flow is along the width, so x is 2 ft. Alternatively, maybe the plate is 2 ft long in the flow direction. Wait, the question says the plate is 2 ft width, and x=2 ft. So the plate's length in the flow direction is 2 ft, and the width is 2 ft. So the area is 2*2=4 ft².

Wait, but the heat transfer rate in the options is in the tens of thousands. So perhaps I made a mistake in the units of h.

Wait, in the options, the units for h are Btu/hr ft² °F. So that's correct. But 0.87 *4 *100 =348 Btu/hr, which doesn't match any option. So perhaps I'm miscalculating h. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different correlation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Colburn analogy, which relates the friction factor to the heat transfer. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the boundary layer thickness first.

Wait, the boundary layer thickness δ can be found using the formula δ = (4 * x * ν) / (V) * sqrt( (1 + (Re_x * ν/V x)^2 )) )? Wait, no, perhaps the formula is δ = (4 * x) / (Re_x^(1/2)) ) * something. Alternatively, for laminar flow, δ = (4.64 x) / sqrt(Re_x). So δ = (4.64 * 2) / sqrt(155748) ≈ 9.28 / 394.6 ≈ 0.0235 ft. So about 0.0235 ft, which is 0.0235 ft, approximately 0.0235 ft.

Looking at the options, option I has δ=0.023 ft, option E has 0.027, option J has 0.020. Hmm, our calculation is 0.0235, so closest to option I's 0.023.

Now, let me go back to the heat transfer coefficient. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let's see, for laminar flow, the Nusselt number is Nu = 0.332 Pr^(1/3) Re^(1/2). So using Re=155,748, Pr=0.7.

Let me compute Re^(1/2): sqrt(155748)= approx 394.6.

Pr^(1/3)=0.7^(1/3)=approx 0.887.

So Nu=0.332 * 0.887 * 394.6=0.332 * 0.887=0.294. 0.294 * 394.6= approx 116. So Nu=116.

So h= (k * Nu)/x = (0.015 * 116)/2 = 1.74 /2=0.87 Btu/hr ft² °F.

Wait, but in the options, the highest h is 1.6 in option A. So perhaps I'm using the wrong k value. Let me check k for air at 150°F. Oh, perhaps k is 0.0145 instead of 0.015. Let me recalculate with k=0.0145.

h= (0.0145 *116)/2= (1.677)/2=0.8385, so about 0.84.

But even then, the options don't have 0.84. So perhaps I should consider that I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the average heat transfer coefficient instead of the local. No, the question asks for the local value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck Re. Let me compute Re again correctly.

V=20 ft/s, x=2 ft, ν=2.57e-4 ft²/s.

Re= (20 * 2) / (2.57e-4) =40 / 0.000257= approx 155,748.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses English units but with different property values. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed to the other parameters and see which option aligns better.

The next parameter is the rate of heat transfer by convection. As I calculated, it's
