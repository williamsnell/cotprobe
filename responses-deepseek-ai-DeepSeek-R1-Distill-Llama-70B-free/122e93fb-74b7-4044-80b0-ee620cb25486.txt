Question:

Why does a physician advise reduced salt intake in cases of hypertension?

Options:

A: Lower salt intake prevents the constriction of blood vessels.
B: Reduced salt intake leads to better insulin sensitivity, which helps lower blood pressure.
C: Reduced salt intake improves heart muscle function directly.
D: Reduced salt intake increases calcium absorption, which indirectly lowers blood pressure.
E: A decreased salt intake causes less water to be retained, decreasing blood volume, and in turn lowering blood pressure.
F: Reduced salt intake helps in weight loss.
G: Decreased salt intake strengthens the heart's electrical system, reducing blood pressure.
H: Decreased salt intake enhances the effectiveness of blood pressure medications.
I: Reduced salt intake reduces the risk of kidney stones.
J: Reduced salt intake decreases the body's cholesterol levels.

Okay, so I need to figure out why a physician would advise reducing salt intake for someone with hypertension. Let me think about what I know about hypertension and salt.

Hypertension is high blood pressure, right? And I remember that diet plays a role in blood pressure. Salt is sodium chloride, and I think it's the sodium part that's relevant here.

So, when you eat too much salt, what happens? I think sodium affects blood volume because it can cause the body to retain water. Oh wait, the kidneys play a role in managing sodium and water balance. If you take in a lot of sodium, the body holds onto water to dilute it, which increases blood volume. More blood volume means the heart has to work harder, and that can increase blood pressure.

So, reducing salt intake would mean less sodium in the body. That should lead to less water retention. If there's less water in the bloodstream, the blood volume decreases. Lower blood volume would mean the heart doesn't have to pump as hard, which would lower blood pressure.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that matches this reasoning. Let's go through them:

Option A: Lower salt intake prevents blood vessel constriction. I'm not sure about this. I think salt's main effect is on blood volume, not directly on vessel constriction. Maybe some other factors influence that, but I don't think this is the primary reason.

Option B: Better insulin sensitivity... Hmm. I know insulin resistance is linked to high blood pressure, but I'm not certain if reducing salt directly affects insulin sensitivity. I think this might be more related to other factors like obesity or certain diets, but not the main reason salt is reduced for blood pressure.

Option C: Improves heart muscle function directly. I don't recall salt intake directly affecting the heart muscle's function in that way. It's more about the blood volume and workload on the heart.

Option D: Increases calcium absorption... I'm not sure how that ties in. Maybe calcium affects blood pressure, but I think the direct link is sodium and water retention.

Option E: Decreased salt leads to less water retention, lower blood volume, lower BP. Yes, this matches what I was thinking earlier. So this seems correct.

Option F: Helps with weight loss. Well, reducing salt might make food less tasty, leading to eating less, but I don't think that's the direct reason. Plus, weight loss does help BP, but the question is about the direct effect of salt.

Option G: Strengthens heart's electrical system. I don't think so. Electrical issues like arrhythmias might be influenced by potassium, not sodium, or maybe medications, but not directly by salt intake.

Option H: Enhances BP medication effectiveness. I'm not sure, but I think some medications might work better with lower sodium, but the question is about why reduce salt on its own.

Option I: Reduces kidney stones. I know that low sodium can help with certain kidney issues, but that's not the main reason for advising it in hypertension.

Option J: Decreases cholesterol. Salt intake doesn't directly affect cholesterol levels; that's more about dietary fats and cholesterol.

So the correct answer should be E.
</think>

The physician advises reduced salt intake in cases of hypertension because excessive sodium leads to water retention, increasing blood volume. This forces the heart to work harder, elevating blood pressure. Reducing salt intake decreases water retention, lowers blood volume, and reduces the heart's workload, thereby lowering blood pressure.

E: A decreased salt intake causes less water to be retained, decreasing blood volume, and in turn lowering blood pressure.

Answer: E
