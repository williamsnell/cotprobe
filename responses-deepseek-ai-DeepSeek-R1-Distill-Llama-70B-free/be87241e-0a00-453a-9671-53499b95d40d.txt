Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is asking about a measure that would be most useful for determining how likely employees are to stay on the job for a long time. In other words, what factor best predicts employee retention or tenure.

The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Job productivity. Hmm, productivity is about how much work someone does. I guess if someone is very productive, the company might want to keep them, but does that directly relate to whether the employee stays? Maybe not the most direct measure. Productive employees might be more likely to stay if they're satisfied, but it's not the same as their likelihood to stay.

Option B: Salary. Salary is important because if someone is paid well, they might be more inclined to stay. But salary alone doesn't always determine retention. Sometimes people leave for other reasons like work environment or growth opportunities, even if the pay is good.

Option C: Motivation. Motivation is about how driven someone is. A motivated employee might be more engaged and thus more likely to stay. But motivation can vary based on many factors, including internal and external factors. It's a bit broad, though.

Option D: Previous employment history. Looking at how long someone stayed at their previous jobs could indicate their tendency to stay or leave. If someone has a history of short-term jobs, they might be more likely to leave again. This seems relevant because past behavior can predict future behavior.

Option E: Age. Age might have some correlation, but it's not the strongest indicator. Younger employees might be more likely to move around as they explore careers, while older employees might stay longer. But age alone doesn't explain everything, and it's not very precise.

Option F: Ambition. Ambitious employees might be more likely to seek promotions or new opportunities, which could lead them to leave if they don't see growth within the company. So higher ambition might actually lead to shorter tenure if their needs aren't met, but it's not a direct measure of retention.

Option G: Job satisfaction. This seems very relevant. If employees are satisfied with their jobs, they are more likely to stay. Job satisfaction covers aspects like happiness with work, work environment, recognition, and more. It makes sense that satisfied employees have higher retention rates.

Option H: Educational background. This might relate to how well someone fits into a role, but it doesn't directly indicate whether they'll stay. People with higher education might have more opportunities elsewhere, but that's speculative.

Option I: Physical health. Good health is important, but unless the job is physically demanding, it might not directly affect retention. Someone in poor health might need more sick days but not necessarily leave the job unless it's due to work-related strain.

Option J: Intelligence. Intelligence can affect job performance but not necessarily how long someone stays. Smarter employees might find the work too easy or too challenging, but again, it's not a direct measure of retention.

Now, considering all these, I think the best options are D and G. Previous employment history (D) does give an indication of past behavior, but job satisfaction (G) is more about the current situation. If employees are satisfied, they are more likely to stay. So between D and G, which is better?

The question is about determining the likelihood of staying. Job satisfaction directly relates to how happy someone is in their current job, which is a strong predictor of retention. Previous employment history is useful but might not capture the current situation as accurately. For example, someone might have had a history of short stays but be very satisfied in their current job, leading them to stay longer.

So I think the answer is G: job satisfaction.

The most useful measure for determining the likelihood that employees will remain on the job for a long period is **job satisfaction**. While factors like previous employment history and salary may provide some insight, job satisfaction directly reflects how content employees are with their current role, which is a strong predictor of retention.

Answer: G
