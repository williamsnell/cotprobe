Okay, so I've got this linear transformation problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about a linear transformation T mapping certain points, and I need to find where it maps (2,1). Let's see.

First, I remember that a linear transformation in R² can be represented by a 2x2 matrix. So, if I can find that matrix, I can apply it to the point (2,1) to get the result.

The problem says that T maps (1,2) to (2,3) and (-1,2) to (2,-3). Hmm, so these two points are vectors in R², and their images under T are given. Since T is linear, it should satisfy the properties of linearity, meaning T(a*v + b*w) = a*T(v) + b*T(w), where a and b are scalars.

So, if I can express (2,1) as a linear combination of (1,2) and (-1,2), then I can apply T to it using the linearity.

Let me set up the equation: Let’s say (2,1) = c1*(1,2) + c2*(-1,2). That gives me a system of equations to solve for c1 and c2.

Breaking it down:
The first component: 2 = c1*1 + c2*(-1) → 2 = c1 - c2
The second component: 1 = c1*2 + c2*2 → 1 = 2c1 + 2c2

So now I have two equations:
1) c1 - c2 = 2
2) 2c1 + 2c2 = 1

Let me solve equation 1 for c1: c1 = 2 + c2

Substitute into equation 2:
2*(2 + c2) + 2c2 = 1 → 4 + 2c2 + 2c2 = 1 → 4 + 4c2 = 1 → 4c2 = -3 → c2 = -3/4

Then c1 = 2 + (-3/4) = 5/4

So, (2,1) = (5/4)(1,2) + (-3/4)(-1,2)

Now, applying T to (2,1) using linearity:
T(2,1) = (5/4)*T(1,2) + (-3/4)*T(-1,2)

We know T(1,2) is (2,3) and T(-1,2) is (2,-3). Plugging these in:

T(2,1) = (5/4)*(2,3) + (-3/4)*(2,-3)

Let me compute each part:

First term: (5/4)*(2,3) = (5/4 * 2, 5/4 *3) = (10/4, 15/4) = (5/2, 15/4)

Second term: (-3/4)*(2,-3) = (-3/4 *2, -3/4*(-3)) → (-6/4, 9/4) = (-3/2, 9/4)

Adding these two vectors together:

x-component: 5/2 + (-3/2) = (5-3)/2 = 2/2 = 1

y-component: 15/4 + 9/4 = (15+9)/4 = 24/4 = 6

Wait, that gives (1,6), which is option G. But looking at the options, option G is (1,6). Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, wait. Did I compute (5/4)*(2,3) correctly? 5/4 times 2 is 10/4 which is 2.5, correct. 5/4 times 3 is 15/4, correct.

Then for the second term, (-3/4)*2 is -6/4 which is -1.5, correct. (-3/4)*(-3) is 9/4, which is 2.25.

Adding the x-components: 2.5 + (-1.5) = 1.0, correct. Y-components: 3.75 + 2.25 = 6.0.

Wait, but in the options, G is (1,6). But the right answer here would be (1,6), which is option G. But wait, I'm looking back at the options to make sure.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the setup. Because the vectors (1,2) and (-1,2) should form a basis, right? So any vector can be expressed as their combination. But perhaps there's another way to approach this problem, like finding the matrix of T directly.

Let me think again. The standard basis vectors are e1=(1,0) and e2=(0,1). If I can find T(e1) and T(e2), then I can construct the matrix.

But I don't have T(e1) or T(e2) given. I have T(1,2) and T(-1,2). So maybe I can express e1 and e2 in terms of (1,2) and (-1,2), then find their images.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up the matrix equation. Let me denote the matrix of T as [[a, b], [c, d]]. Then applying T to (1,2) gives (a*1 + b*2, c*1 + d*2) = (2,3). Similarly, T(-1,2) is (a*(-1) + b*2, c*(-1) + d*2) = (2,-3).

So, I can set up the system of equations:

From T(1,2) = (2,3):
a + 2b = 2  → equation 1
c + 2d = 3  → equation 3

From T(-1,2) = (2,-3):
- a + 2b = 2 → equation 2
- c + 2d = -3 → equation 4

Now, let's solve for a and b first.

From equations 1 and 2:
Equation 1: a + 2b = 2
Equation 2: -a + 2b = 2

Adding equations 1 and 2:
(a - a) + (2b + 2b) = 2 + 2 → 4b =4 → b=1

Now plug b=1 into equation 1:
a + 2*1 = 2 → a=0.

So a=0, b=1.

Now for c and d, using equations 3 and 4.

Equation 3: c + 2d =3
Equation 4: -c + 2d =-3

Let's add equations 3 and 4:
(c - c) + (2d + 2d) =3 + (-3) → 4d =0 → d=0.

Now plug d=0 into equation 3:
c + 0 =3 → c=3.

So the matrix T is [[0,1],[3,0]]

Now, applying this matrix to the vector (2,1):

Compute T*(2,1) = [0*2 +1*1, 3*2 +0*1] = (0+1, 6+0) → (1,6), which is option G.

Wait, but earlier when I did it the first way, I also got (1,6). But looking back, the options include G as (1,6). So that should be the correct answer, right?

Wait, but wait, I thought maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I can check with another approach.

Alternatively, since I found the matrix, I can confirm using another method. Let me see.

Alternatively, I can express (2,1) as a combination of (1,2) and (-1,2), as I did before, and then apply T to get the same result.

Yes, I did that and got (1,6). So both methods give the same answer, so I think that's correct.

But wait, looking at the options again: option G is (1,6), which is what I got.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first saw the options, I thought (1,6) wasn't present but now I see it is. So I think the correct answer should be G.

To determine where the linear transformation \( T: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2 \) maps the point \((2, 1)\), we first note that \( T \) is represented by a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix. The problem provides the images of two vectors: \( T(1, 2) = (2, 3) \) and \( T(-1, 2) = (2, -3) \). Using this information, we can construct the matrix of \( T \).

Let the matrix of \( T \) be:

\[
T = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Applying \( T \) to the vectors \((1, 2)\) and \((-1, 2)\), we get the following system of equations:

1. From \( T(1, 2) = (2, 3) \):
   \[
   a + 2b = 2 \tag{1}
   \]
   \[
   c + 2d = 3 \tag{3}
   \]

2. From \( T(-1, 2) = (2, -3) \):
   \[
   -a + 2b = 2 \tag{2}
   \]
   \[
   -c + 2d = -3 \tag{4}
   \]

### Solving for \( a \) and \( b \):
From equations (1) and (2):
\[
a + 2b = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad -a + 2b = 2.
\]
Adding these equations:
\[
4b = 4 \implies b = 1.
\]
Substituting \( b = 1 \) into equation (1):
\[
a + 2(1) = 2 \implies a = 0.
\]

### Solving for \( c \) and \( d \):
From equations (3) and (4):
\[
c + 2d = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad -c + 2d = -3.
\]
Adding these equations:
\[
4d = 0 \implies d = 0.
\]
Substituting \( d = 0 \) into equation (3):
\[
c + 2(0) = 3 \implies c = 3.
\]

Thus, the matrix of \( T \) is:

\[
T = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 3 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Applying \( T \) to \( (2, 1) \):
Using the matrix \( T \), we compute:

\[
T(2, 1) = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 3 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0(2) + 1(1) \\ 3(2) + 0(1) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Therefore, \( T(2, 1) = (1, 6) \), which corresponds to option **G**.

**Answer: G**
