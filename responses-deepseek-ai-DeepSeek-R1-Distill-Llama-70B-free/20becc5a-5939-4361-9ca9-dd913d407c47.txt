Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about determining the order of a reaction and writing the rate law. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on kinetics, but let's try to think this through.

The reaction given is between OH^- and CH3COOCH2CH3, which I think is ethyl acetate. The products are acetate ion and ethanol. The data table shows the concentrations of these two reactants at various times.

The question has two parts: (a) determine if the reaction is first or second order, and (b) write the rate law expression. The options are from A to J, each suggesting a different rate law.

First, I remember that for a reaction mechanism, the rate law is determined experimentally, often using the method of initial rates or looking at how concentrations change over time. Since the data is given over time, maybe I can use that.

Looking at the table, at each time point, the concentrations of both [CH3COOCH2CH3] and [OH^-] are the same. Like at 5 minutes, both are 0.0128 M. Same with the other times. So that suggests that the stoichiometry is 1:1 between these two reactants. So maybe the reaction is bimolecular, involving both.

Wait, but how does that help with the order? Let's think about possible rate laws. For a reaction A + B → products, the rate could be first order in each, making it overall second order. Or it could be first order in one and second in the other, but looking at the data, perhaps it's more straightforward.

Another approach: let's see if the data fits a second-order pattern. For a second-order reaction where the concentrations of both reactants are equal and decreasing, there's a specific integrated rate law. For a reaction where two reactants are consumed at the same rate, like A and B reacting 1:1, and starting with equal concentrations, the rate law might be something like 1/[A] = kt + 1/[A]0, but wait, that's for a second-order reaction with a single reactant.

Wait, no. For a reaction where two different reactants are involved and the rate is first order in each, the overall order is two. But when their concentrations are equal, perhaps that simplifies things.

Alternatively, maybe this is a case where both concentrations decrease at the same rate, which implies that their concentrations are equal throughout, so perhaps the rate law is first order in each, making it second order overall.

Looking at the data, let's see if the rate is constant. I can calculate the rate for each interval. The rate is the change in concentration over change in time.

For example, from 0 to 5 min: [CH3COOCH2CH3] goes from 0.02 to 0.0128. So the change is 0.02 - 0.0128 = 0.0072 M over 5 min. So rate is 0.0072 /5 = 0.00144 M/min.

At 5 to 15 min: 0.0128 to 0.00766 is a change of 0.00514 M over 10 min. Rate is 0.00514/10 = 0.000514 M/min.

Hmm, the rate is decreasing. So that suggests that the reaction isn't zero order, because in zero order the rate stays constant (as it depends only on the rate constant).

Wait, but looking at the initial rate, maybe I can use two points to determine the order. Let's take two time intervals where concentrations have changed significantly.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of initial rates. Wait, but the data provided isn't for different experiments; it's a single experiment over time. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait a second, for a reaction where two reactants are involved and their concentrations are equal, and both are being consumed, the rate equation might be rate = k[A][B]. Since [A]=[B], then rate = k[A]^2. So the overall order would be two. But wait, that's a special case when the concentrations are equal. But how does that affect the rate law?

Wait no, the rate law depends on the orders in each reactant. If it's first order in each, then overall second order. But if the concentrations are equal, that doesn't change the orders, just the way the rate constant appears.

So looking at the data, perhaps I can test for first or second order. Let's check if the half-life is constant (which would indicate first order), or if 1/[A] vs time is linear (second order).

Wait, but the reaction is between two reactants, so I'm not sure if the half-life approach applies directly. Alternatively, maybe I can see how the concentration changes with time in a way that suggests the order.

Wait, another idea: for a reaction where the stoichiometry is 1:1 and both are first order, the rate law is rate = k[A][B]. If [A] = [B] at all times, then rate = k[A]^2. So the reaction would appear second order overall. But wait, in this case, since both are being consumed, does that hold?

Wait, let me think again. The initial concentrations are both 0.02 M. As the reaction proceeds, each reacts in a 1:1 ratio. So yes, their concentrations remain equal. Therefore, [A] = [B] at any time.

So the rate law would be rate = k [A][B] = k [A]^2.

If that's the case, then for a second-order reaction in a single reactant, the integrated rate law is 1/[A] = kt + 1/[A]_0.

So let me see if a plot of 1/[A] vs time is linear. If yes, then it's second order.

Let's calculate 1/[A] for each time point.

At time 0: 1/0.02 = 50.

5 min: 1/0.0128 ≈ 78.125

15 min: 1/0.00766 ≈ 130.6

25 min: 1/0.0054 ≈ 185.2

35 min: 1/0.00426 ≈ 234.8

55 min: 1/0.00289 ≈ 346.0

120 min: 1/0.00137 ≈ 730.0

Now, let's see if these points show a linear increase with time. Hmm, each step increases in 1/[A], so it's roughly a straight line.

Calculating the slope between each consecutive points:

From 0 to 5 min: change in 1/[A] is 78.125 - 50 = 28.125 over 5 min. Slope is 28.125/5 = 5.625.

From 5 to 15 min (10 min interval): 130.6 -78.125 = 52.475 over 10 min. Slope: 5.2475.

From 15 to 25 (10 min): 185.2 -130.6 =54.6 → 5.46 per min.

25-35 min (10): 234.8-185.2=49.6 →4.96 per min.

35-55 (20): 346-234.8=111.2 →5.56 per 20 min → 2.78 per min? Wait, that's not consistent. Wait 55 min is after 35, which is 20 min later. So 111.2 over 20 min → 5.56 per 10 min units?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the slope between all points.

Wait, maybe I should take the change in 1/[A] divided by the change in time.

For example, between 0 and 5: 28.125 /5 =5.625.

Between 5 and15: (130.6-78.125)/(15-5)=52.475/10=5.2475.

Between 15 and25: (185.2-130.6)/10=54.6/10=5.46.

Between25 and35: (234.8-185.2)/10=49.6/10=4.96.

Between35 and55: (346-234.8)/(55-35)=111.2/20=5.56.

Between55 and120: (730-346)/(120-55)=384/65 ≈5.907.

Hmm, these slopes are all roughly around 5.2 to 5.9, which is somewhat consistent but not exactly the same. Maybe experimental error or calculation approximations. But overall, the trend suggests a linear increase in 1/[A] with time, which implies a second-order reaction with respect to [A], but wait, because in this case, [A] and [B] are the same, so rate =k [A][B] =k [A]^2.

So the rate law would be second order overall, with rate =k [A][B]. But since [A]=[B], it behaves as second order in [A].

Wait, but looking at the answer options, I need to pick the correct rate law.

Looking at the options:

Option G: Second order, rate = k[OH^-][CH3COOCH2CH3]

That fits, because each is first order, making it overall second order.

Option I is third order, which doesn't fit.

Option A is second order but has [OH^-] squared, which isn't what we have here.

So part (a) is second order, and (b) the rate law is G.

So the correct answer should be G.
</think>

To determine the order of the reaction and write the rate law, we analyze the given data:

1. **Reaction and Data**: The reaction is between OH⁻ and CH₃COOCH₂CH₃ (ethyl acetate), producing CH₃COO⁻ and CH₃CH₂OH. The concentrations of both reactants decrease equally over time, indicating a 1:1 stoichiometry.

2. **Rate Law and Order**: For a reaction where two reactants are involved and their concentrations are equal throughout, the rate law can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Rate} = k[\text{CH₃COOCH₂CH₃}][\text{OH}^-]
   \]
   Since the reaction is first order in each reactant, the overall order is second order.

3. **Verification Using Integrated Rate Law**: For a second-order reaction where the concentrations of the two reactants are equal, the integrated rate law is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{[\text{A}]} = kt + \frac{1}{[\text{A}]_0}
   \]
   Calculating \(1/[\text{CH₃COOCH₂CH₃}]\) at each time point and plotting it against time shows a roughly linear relationship, confirming that the reaction follows second-order kinetics.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option G**: "Second order, rate = \(k[\text{OH}^-][\text{CH₃COOCH₂CH₃}]\)" matches the derived rate law and is consistent with the data.
   - Other options (e.g., A, B, C, etc.) either suggest the wrong order or incorrect dependence on the reactants.

Thus, the reaction is second order, and the correct rate law is:

**Rate = \(k[\text{OH}^-][\text{CH₃COOCH₂CH₃}]\)**.
