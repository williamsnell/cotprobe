Okay, so I've got this math problem here about converting liters to gallons and quarts to liters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on unit conversions, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has two parts, (A) and (B). Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with part (A): How many gallons are in 12 liters? Oh right, I remember that liters can be converted to gallons using a conversion factor. Looking at the data provided, I see that 1 liter is equal to 0.264 gallons. So if 1 liter is 0.264 gallons, then 12 liters would be 12 times that. Let me calculate that. 12 multiplied by 0.264. Hmm, 0.264 times 10 is 2.64, and 0.264 times 2 is 0.528. Adding them together, 2.64 + 0.528 equals 3.168 gallons. So part (A) should be 3.168 gallons.

Now for part (B): How many liters are in 10 quarts? Oh wait, so I need to convert quarts to liters. The given data says that 1 quart is equal to 0.946 liters. So if I have 10 quarts, I multiply 10 by 0.946. Let me do that. 10 times 0.946 is 9.46 liters. So part (B) is 9.46 liters.

Looking back at the options, I need to find the one where (A) is 3.168 and (B) is 9.46. Let's check each option.

Option A: (A) 3.168 and (B) 9.46. That matches my calculations. Option H has (A) 3.168 but (B) 10.46, which is higher. Option I has (B) 11, which is way off. Option J has (B) 10, which is also not matching. So the correct answer is option A.

The correct answers are:

(A) 3.168 gallons and (B) 9.46 liters.

The option that matches both answers is A.
