Okay, so I've got this problem about gases and their pressures. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question says there are two bulbs with ideal gases A and B. I remember that ideal gases obey the ideal gas law, PV = nRT.

The problem states that the density of gas A is twice that of gas B. Oh wait, density is mass per unit volume, right? So density ρ = mass/volume. And the molecular weight (M) is the mass of one mole of the substance. So for a gas, the density can be calculated using the molar mass and the ideal gas law.

Wait, how's density related to the other variables? I think for an ideal gas, the density ρ is equal to (P M) / (R T), where P is pressure, M is molar mass, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature. Because from PV = nRT, and n is moles, which is mass (m) divided by M. So n = m/M. Then, PV = (m/M) RT. Rearranging, m/V = (P M)/(R T), which is density ρ. So ρ = (P M) / (R T).

So for gas A, ρ_A = (P_A * M_A) / (R T), and for gas B, ρ_B = (P_B * M_B) / (R T). 

The problem says that ρ_A is twice ρ_B. So:

ρ_A = 2 ρ_B

Substituting the expressions:

(P_A * M_A)/(R T) = 2 * (P_B * M_B)/(R T)

Wait, R and T are the same for both, so they can be canceled out from both sides. So:

P_A * M_A = 2 * P_B * M_B

That's the equation I get from the densities.

But wait, the problem also gives the molecular weights. It says the molecular weight of gas A is half that of gas B. So M_A = (1/2) M_B. Or, M_B = 2 M_A.

Let me substitute M_A = (1/2) M_B into the previous equation.

P_A * (1/2 M_B) = 2 P_B * M_B

Simplify both sides:

(1/2) P_A M_B = 2 P_B M_B

The M_B terms can be canceled since they appear on both sides and assuming they're not zero.

(1/2) P_A = 2 P_B

Multiply both sides by 2:

P_A = 4 P_B

Wait, so the pressure of A is four times that of B. But wait, what's the question again? Oh right, the ratio of pressure A to pressure B. So P_A / P_B = 4. 

Looking at the options, option C is 4. So the answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the relationship between density, pressure, and molecular weight for ideal gases. The density of a gas is given by:

\[
\rho = \frac{P M}{R T}
\]

where \(P\) is the pressure, \(M\) is the molecular weight, \(R\) is the gas constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. For gases A and B, we can write:

\[
\rho_A = \frac{P_A M_A}{R T}, \quad \rho_B = \frac{P_B M_B}{R T}
\]

The problem states that the density of gas A is twice that of gas B, so:

\[
\rho_A = 2 \rho_B
\]

Substituting the expressions for \(\rho_A\) and \(\rho_B\):

\[
\frac{P_A M_A}{R T} = 2 \frac{P_B M_B}{R T}
\]

Since \(R\) and \(T\) are the same for both gases, they cancel out:

\[
P_A M_A = 2 P_B M_B
\]

The problem also states that the molecular weight of gas A is half that of gas B, so:

\[
M_A = \frac{1}{2} M_B
\]

Substituting \(M_A = \frac{1}{2} M_B\) into the equation:

\[
P_A \left(\frac{1}{2} M_B\right) = 2 P_B M_B
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{1}{2} P_A M_B = 2 P_B M_B
\]

Cancel \(M_B\) from both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{2} P_A = 2 P_B
\]

Multiply through by 2:

\[
P_A = 4 P_B
\]

Thus, the ratio of the pressure of gas A to gas B is:

\[
\frac{P_A}{P_B} = 4
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: 4**
