Question:

The dorsal root of a nerve leading to the leg of a rat is severed. How will this affect the rat? How would the effect vary if the ventral root were severed instead?

Options:

A: Severing either the dorsal or ventral root will result in the rat's inability to regenerate the affected nerve.
B: Severing the dorsal root will prevent sensory impulses from reaching the brain, resulting in loss of sensation and reflex action. Severing the ventral root will prevent motor impulses from reaching the muscles, resulting in inability to move the affected limb.
C: Severing either root will have no effect on the rat.
D: Severing the ventral root will cause the rat to lose control over its body temperature regulation in the affected limb.
E: Severing the dorsal root will result in increased motor function in the affected limb, while severing the ventral root will lead to increased sensitivity to pain.
F: Severing the ventral root will enhance the rat's ability to move the affected limb.
G: Severing the dorsal root will enhance the rat's sense of touch.
H: Severing the dorsal root will improve the rat's coordination and balance, while severing the ventral root will lead to a loss of muscular strength.
I: Severing the ventral root will result in the loss of sensation in the affected limb, while severing the dorsal root will not affect the limb's functionality.
J: Severing the dorsal root will cause paralysis in the affected limb, whereas severing the ventral root will have no significant effect on the rat's limb function.

Okay, so I've got this question here about a rat's nerve roots being severed and how that affects the rat. I'm a bit rusty on my neuroanatomy, but let me try to think this through.

The question is about the dorsal and ventral roots of a nerve leading to the leg. I remember that nerves have these roots near the spinal cord. The dorsal root is associated with sensory functions, right? Like, it's the afferent part, carrying signals from sensory receptors towards the central nervous system. So if the dorsal root is cut, the rat wouldn't be able to feel sensations from that leg anymore. That would mean loss of sensation, and maybe reflexes too since some reflexes are mediated at the spinal level and require sensory input.

Then there's the ventral root, which I think is the motor part. It carries efferent signals from the CNS to the muscles and glands. So if the ventral root is severed, the motor signals can't get through. That should cause paralysis or inability to move that limb because the muscles wouldn't receive the necessary impulses.

Looking at the options:

Option B says that severing the dorsal root prevents sensory impulses, causing loss of sensation and reflex action. Severing the ventral root stops motor impulses, so the rat can't move the limb. That sounds right.

Option J says the opposite, that cutting the dorsal root causes paralysis. No, that doesn't make sense because the motor function is handled by the ventral root. So J is probably wrong.

Option A says both can't regenerate. I don't think that's correct because the question is about the effect, not regeneration. Plus, I think nerves can sometimes regenerate, but this option is mixing up the effects.

Option E talks about increased motor function when dorsal is cut. No, cutting the sensory root shouldn't affect motor function positively. And increased sensitivity if ventral is cut? That doesn't seem right either.

Option B seems correct. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the roots. Dorsal is sensory in, ventral is motor out. So cutting the sensory root would mean no feelingâ€”so the rat can't feel pain or anything in that leg. Since reflexes often require sensory input (like withdrawing a limb from something hot), reflexes might be affected because the signal can't get to the spinal cord.

On the other hand, cutting the ventral root would mean the motor neurons can't signal the muscles. So the muscles can't contract, leading to paralysis of that limb. The rat wouldn't be able to move it but might still feel things if the sensory root is intact.

So option B fits this understanding. Let me check other options again quickly. Option I says that cutting the ventral root causes loss of sensation, which is wrong because that's the motor root.

Thus, the correct answer should be option B.

The dorsal root is responsible for sensory input (afferent), while the ventral root handles motor output (efferent). Severing the dorsal root would prevent sensory impulses from reaching the brain, leading to loss of sensation and reflexes in the affected limb. Conversely, severing the ventral root would disrupt motor impulses, causing paralysis of the limb. 

Option B correctly describes these effects: cutting the dorsal root results in loss of sensation and reflex action, while cutting the ventral root leads to inability to move the affected limb.

Answer: B
