Question:

A distributor agrees to sell 100 tubes of growth hormone to a medical treatment center in exchange for $30,000. The contract has many clauses, including one that prohibits generally the assignment of the contract or any of its terms. The distributor assigns its right to receive the funds anyway. Will a court enforce the bar against assignment under these circumstances?

Options:

A: No, a bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive the funds unless specifically stated.
B: Yes, unless the contract explicitly states that the bar of assignment does not apply to the right to receive funds.
C: No, a bar of assignment can only be enforced if it is notarized and legally binding.
D: Yes, a bar against the right to receive proceeds is a favored restriction unless otherwise stated.
E: Yes, a contractual provision prohibiting assignments is enforceable in all respects.
F: Yes, a bar of assignment applies to all aspects of the contract, including the right to receive funds.
G: No, a bar of assignment is an unconstitutional deprivation of due process.
H: No, a bar of assignment is unenforceable if it inhibits the completion of the contract.
I: No, a court will not enforce the bar against assignment as it infringes upon the distributor's right to do business.
J: Yes, a contractual provision prohibiting assignments is enforceable unless it contradicts federal law.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically dealing with assignment of rights. Hmm, I remember that when a contract includes a clause that prohibits assignment, it can affect whether a party can transfer their rights or duties to another. But wait, how exactly does that work?

The question says a distributor agreed to sell 100 tubes of growth hormone for $30,000. The contract has a clause prohibiting assignment of the contract or any of its terms. But the distributor went ahead and assigned the right to receive the funds anyway. The question is whether a court will enforce that bar on assignment.

So, I think about what an assignment is. Typically, a party can assign their rights under a contract unless there's a specific prohibition. But when there is a prohibition, does that mean the assignment is invalid or just that the assignor can't enforce it? Or does it depend on the type of right being assigned?

I remember that some rights are more enforceable even if assigned. For example, the right to receive money, like a right to payment, is generally assignable unless the contract specifically says otherwise. So even if the contract prohibits assignment, if the assignment is just of the right to receive funds, maybe it's still allowed.

Wait, but the contract in this case says it prohibits assignment of the contract or any of its terms. So does that include the right to receive payment? I'm a bit confused about that. Some cases I've heard about say that anti-assignment clauses are enforceable, but others say that certain rights, like payment, are exceptions.

I think there's a rule that the right to receive money can be assigned unless the contract explicitly prohibits it. So if the contract just has a general prohibition on assignment, maybe the assignment of the right to receive funds is still okay. Because the right to payment is seen as a separate right, not necessarily part of the main duties under the contract.

So looking at the options, option A says no, a bar doesn't apply unless specifically stated. Option F says yes, the bar applies to all aspects. Option B says yes unless explicitly stated about funds. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. If the contract generally prohibits assignment, but doesn't specifically mention the right to receive funds, does that matter? I think the general rule is that a general prohibition on assignment doesn't prevent the assignment of the right to receive payment because that's a chose in action, which is assignable unless specifically restricted.

So in that case, the distributor assigning the right to receive funds would still be valid, and the court would not enforce the bar. That points towards option A being correct. Because the bar doesn't apply to the right to receive funds unless specifically stated.

Alternatively, option E says the bar is enforceable in all respects, which would mean the assignment is prohibited. But I don't think that's the case. Some jurisdictions might enforce a general bar against assignment, but others might not when it's just the right to payment.

Wait, I'm a bit uncertain about this. Another approach: under the UCC, for example, accounts and payment rights are often assignable. So perhaps even with a general prohibition, the right to receive payment is assignable unless the contract specifically prohibits that.

So in the scenario, the contract has a general bar. So the assignment of the right to receive funds would be allowed despite the general bar. So the court would not enforce the bar in this case.

Looking at the options again, option A says no, the bar doesn't apply unless specifically stated. So that fits. Option F says the bar applies to all aspects, which would mean the assignment is prohibited. But the right to receive funds is an exception, so F is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be A.

The question revolves around whether a court will enforce a contractual bar against assignment when a distributor assigns its right to receive funds despite a general prohibition on assignment in the contract. The key issue is whether a general bar on assignment applies to the right to receive payment or if such a right is an exception unless explicitly prohibited.

Under general contract law, while a contractual provision prohibiting assignment is enforceable, there is an exception for the right to receive funds unless the contract explicitly prohibits it. This exception is based on the principle that the right to payment is considered a separate and assignable right, often referred to as a "chose in action." Therefore, a general bar on assignment does not automatically extend to the right to receive funds unless the contract explicitly states so.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** correctly states that a bar on assignment does not apply to the right to receive funds unless specifically stated. This aligns with the exception for payment rights.
- **Option F** incorrectly assumes that a general bar on assignment applies to all aspects of the contract, including the right to receive funds, which is not the case.
- Other options either misstate the law or introduce irrelevant factors (e.g., notarization or constitutional issues).

Thus, the court would not enforce the bar against assignment in this case because the right to receive funds is assignable under the general rule unless explicitly prohibited.
