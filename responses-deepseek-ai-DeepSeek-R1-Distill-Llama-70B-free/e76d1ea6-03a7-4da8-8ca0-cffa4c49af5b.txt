Question:

Billy was charged with grand theft. The trial began on a Thursday afternoon. The jury was empaneled, sworn and released for the day. Since Friday was the Fourth of July, the judge asked the jurors to return on Monday. The trial began again on Monday morning at 8:30. By late evening the judge had instructed the jury. Due to the lateness of the hour, the jurors were sequestered for the evening to allow them to get an early start the next morning. The jurors returned Tuesday morning and were unable to reach a verdict. Unable to reach a verdict, the trial judge allowed the jurors to go home that evening. On Wednesday morning, the jury assembled and returned a verdict of guilty. On appeal, which of the following is Billy's strongest issue for seeking a reversal?

Options:

A: The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after being sworn.
B: The fact that the jurors did not begin to consider evidence until several days after they were empaneled.
C: The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after they began deliberations.
D: The fact that the trial began on a holiday weekend.
E: The fact that the jury was not given enough time to deliberate.
F: The fact that the jury was sequestered for only one night.
G: The fact that the jury took several days to return a verdict.
H: The fact that the jury returned a verdict of guilty.
I: The fact that the jury did not start deliberating until the following week.
J: The fact that the trial began late in the afternoon.

Okay, so I have this question about a legal scenario, and I need to figure out the best answer. Let me read through it carefully.

So Billy is charged with grand theft. The trial started on a Thursday afternoon. They empaneled and swore in the jury, then released them for the day. Friday was the Fourth of July, a holiday, so the judge told the jurors to come back on Monday. On Monday morning, the trial resumed at 8:30. By late evening, the judge gave the jury instructions, and because it was late, they sequestered the jury for the night to get an early start Tuesday. 

On Tuesday morning, the jury came back but couldn't reach a verdict. They were unable to decide, so the judge let them go home that evening. Then on Wednesday morning, they came back and delivered a guilty verdict. Now, Billy is appealing, and we need to find his strongest issue for reversal.

The options are A through J, each pointing out a different potential issue. I need to pick the strongest one.

First, I remember that once a jury is sworn in, they are usually kept together, especially if the case is such that they might be influenced by outside factors. But there's a rule about when the jury can separate after being sworn. If they're allowed to go home or separate, that could be a problem because it might expose them to external influences, which could affect their verdict.

Looking at the timeline: The jury was sworn on Thursday afternoon and released. Then they came back Monday. So they were allowed to go home after being sworn but before deliberations started. Then, after being instructed, they were sequestered for the night. Then on Tuesday, after not reaching a verdict, they were allowed to go home again before coming back Wednesday.

Wait, so the key point here is whether the jury was allowed to separate after being sworn in. Because once the jury is sworn, any separation without the defendant's consent can be a problem. This is to prevent jury tampering or influence.

So looking at the options:

Option A: The fact that the jury was allowed to go home after being sworn. That's what happened here. They were sworn on Thursday and released, then resumed on Monday. So that's a possible issue.

Option C: Allowed to go home after beginning deliberations. They were sequestered Monday night, then on Tuesday they couldn't reach a verdict and went home Tuesday evening. So that's another separation, but perhaps that's allowed if the court approves it. I think the critical point is the initial separation after being sworn but before deliberation.

Because the general rule is that once the jury is sworn, they should not separate without the defendant's consent. If the separation happens before deliberations have begun, that's a problem.

So Billy's strongest issue would be that the jury was allowed to go home after being sworn, which is option A.

Other options: Option C talks about after deliberations began. But the first separation was before any deliberations. So the main issue is the initial separation after being sworn but before they started considering the case.

Thus, the correct answer should be A.

The strongest issue for Billy on appeal is that the jury was allowed to go home after being sworn in but before starting deliberations. This violates the rule that once sworn, the jury should not separate without the defendant's consent, as it risks external influence. 

Answer: A
