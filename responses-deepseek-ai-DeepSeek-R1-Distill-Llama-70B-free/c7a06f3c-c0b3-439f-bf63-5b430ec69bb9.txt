Okay, so I've got this question about the heart and blood flow. I'm a bit rusty on my anatomy, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is: Blood flows from the right ventricle into which structure? The options are A through J, with various vessels and chambers listed.

First, I remember that the heart has four chambers: right atrium, left atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle. I think blood flows from the atria into the ventricles, and then from the ventricles into other structures.

So the right ventricle must pump blood out to somewhere. I'm trying to remember the path of blood through the heart. Deoxygenated blood comes into the right atrium through the superior and inferior vena cava. Then it flows into the right ventricle. From there, it's pumped to the lungs to get oxygenated.

Wait, where does it go from the right ventricle? Oh right, the pulmonary artery. Because the pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs. So the right ventricle connects to the pulmonary artery.

Looking at the options, let me see. Option J is Pulmonary arteries. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but what are the other options? Let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. Option A is coronary arteries, which I think branch off the aorta and supply blood to the heart muscle itself. So that's not where the right ventricle sends blood.

Options B and F are the vena cava, which are the veins that bring blood into the right atrium, so the right ventricle doesn't pump into them. Option C is pulmonary capillaries, which are in the lungs where gas exchange happens, but the ventricle doesn't directly connect to capillariesâ€”it goes through arteries first.

Option D is the right atrium, which is where the blood comes from before entering the ventricle, so that's the opposite direction. E is left atrium, which is on the other side. G is the aorta, which comes from the left ventricle, carrying oxygenated blood out to the body. H is the left ventricle, which is next to the right one but they don't directly connect except through the septum. I is the pulmonary veins, which bring oxygenated blood back from the lungs to the left atrium.

So yeah, the correct answer should be J: Pulmonary arteries.

The right ventricle pumps blood to the pulmonary arteries, which carry deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation. Among the options provided, the correct structure is the pulmonary arteries.

Answer: J
