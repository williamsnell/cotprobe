Okay, so I've got this question about cognitive distortions as defined by Aaron Beck. Hmm, I remember that Beck's model is all about how negative thought patterns contribute to various psychological issues, like depression and anxiety. The question is about Samuel, who's 43 and just got a bonus at work but feels like he's about to be fired. I need to figure out which cognitive distortion he's exhibiting.

Let me try to break this down. First, the question provides a statement from Samuel: he's been given a bonus, which should be a positive event, but he's feeling like he's going to be fired. That seems contradictory. So, he's interpreting a positive situation in a negative way.

I remember there are several cognitive distortions. Let me list some of them to see which fits. There's polarized thinking, where someone sees things in extremes, like all good or all bad. Then there's magnification, which is like catastrophizing, making things seem worse than they are. Minimization is the opposite, making things seem less significant. Arbitrary inference is when someone draws a conclusion without evidence or even against the evidence. Overgeneralization is taking a single event and seeing it as a pattern. Mustabatory thinking, I think that's when someone believes they must do something or that things have to be a certain way. Mind reading is assuming you know what others are thinking. Selective abstraction is focusing on one detail and ignoring the bigger picture. Personalization is taking things too personally.

So, Samuel's situation: he's been given a bonus, which is typically a positive sign, indicating good performance. But he feels like he's about to be fired, which is negative. So he's taking a positive event and interpreting it as a negative sign.

Which distortion fits this? Let's think. Arbitrary inference is when someone makes a conclusion without evidence. In this case, Samuel is concluding he's about to be fired despite the bonus, which doesn't logically make sense. There's no evidence given that he's in trouble, so this seems like an arbitrary inference. Alternatively, could it be mind reading? Like, he's assuming his employer is thinking of firing him. But the question doesn't state that he's assuming what others are thinking; he just feels he's going to be fired.

Another possibility is overgeneralization, but that's more about seeing a pattern based on one event. Samuel isn't necessarily generalizing here; he's just making a negative conclusion from a positive event.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's magnification, but that's more about making something seem worse. But in this case, he's not making the situation worse; he's just interpreting it negatively without basis.

So, I think the best fit here is arbitrary inference because he's drawing a negative conclusion (about to be fired) without evidence, and in fact, the evidence (bonus) suggests the opposite. So, he's making an inference that isn't supported by the facts at hand.

Samuel is experiencing a positive event (receiving a bonus) but interprets it as a negative sign (feeling like he's about to be fired). This indicates a cognitive distortion where he draws a negative conclusion without evidence, which aligns with **arbitrary inference**.
