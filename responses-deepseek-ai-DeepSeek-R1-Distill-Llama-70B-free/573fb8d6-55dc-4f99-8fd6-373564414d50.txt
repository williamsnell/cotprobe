The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A nephew brings an action against the administrator of his uncle's estate based upon a contract for services rendered in the management of his uncle's property. In order to rebut the presumption that the services rendered were gratuitous, since the nephew was a relative of his uncle, the nephew called his sister-in-law as a witness. Assume that this jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect. The sister-in-law testified that she had lived in the nephew's house, knew his uncle, and that she was familiar with the uncle's handwriting. The nephew's attorney asked her to look at a letter and to tell the court whether it was written by the uncle. Upon objection by the attorney for the administrator of the estate, the trial judge would most likely

Options:

A: overrule the objection, because an authenticating witness need not be an expert if familiar with the handwriting of the person in question.
B: sustain the objection, because the letter was not previously disclosed to the court.
C: sustain the objection, because the sister-in-law's testimony could be biased in favor of the nephew.
D: sustain the objection, because the sister-in-law is not a handwriting expert.
E: overrule the objection, because the letter can be considered as a document affecting the disposition of property.
F: sustain the objection, because the sister-in-law is not an immediate family member.
G: overrule the objection, because the Dead Man's Statute does not apply to written evidence.
H: overrule the objection, because the letter qualifies as a past recollection recorded, an exception to the hearsay rule.
I: overrule the objection, because the sister-in-law is a reliable witness due to her relationship with the nephew.
J: sustain the objection, because of the Dead Man's Statute.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about evidence and the Dead Man's Statute. Hmm, let's try to break it down. 

The situation is a nephew suing the administrator of his uncle's estate. The claim is based on a contract for services in managing the uncle's property. But since they're relatives, there's a presumption that the services were gratuitous, meaning the nephew did it for free. So the nephew wants to rebut that presumption. He calls his sister-in-law as a witness.

Now, the Dead Man's Statute is in play here. I remember that the Dead Man's Statute, also known as the hearsay exception when a party is deceased, generally prevents a party from testifying about communications or transactions with a deceased person when the other party is interested in the outcome. But wait, in this case, the witness is the sister-in-law, not the nephew. So does the statute apply to her testimony?

The sister-in-law testifies that she knows the uncle's handwriting. Then, the nephew's attorney asks her to look at a letter and say if it's written by the uncle. The administrator's attorney objects. The question is whether the judge will overrule or sustain the objection.

So, the options are A through J, each giving a reason. Let me think about the Dead Man's Statute. Typically, it applies when a witness is testifying about a transaction or communication with the deceased, and the witness is a party to the case or has an interest in the outcome. If the sister-in-law is testifying about the uncle's handwriting, is she testifying about a transaction or communication with the deceased?

Wait, she's just authenticating the letter. Authentication of handwriting can be done by a non-expert if they're familiar with the handwriting. So that part seems okay. But the Dead Man's Statute might block her from testifying about certain things.

Wait, but the Dead Man's Statute usually applies to exclude testimony by a party who is a beneficiary, for example, from testifying about the deceased's statements or actions. Here, the sister-in-law is not the deceased. The deceased is the uncle. So she's a third party witness. But the nephew is a party, so if she's testifying about something that relates to the uncle's intent or transactions, maybe that's where the statute comes in.

Alternatively, the Dead Man's Statute might prevent the nephew from testifying about his own transactions with the deceased uncle because the nephew is a party and the uncle is deceased. But the sister-in-law is a different person. Unless the statute applies to her as well because she's related to the nephew, but I don't think so. The statute usually applies to the party against the estate, not other witnesses.

Wait, but the question is about authenticating a letter. So, if the sister-in-law is asked to authenticate the uncle's handwriting, is that testimony about a matter that's covered by the Dead Man's Statute? Or is it just about authentication, which is a different issue.

I think authentication is a separate matter from the content of the document. So, if the sister-in-law is familiar with the uncle's handwriting, she can testify to that without violating the Dead Man's Statute. Because she's not testifying about a transaction or a communication with the deceased, just about the handwriting.

Wait, but if the letter's content is being offered for its truth, that's hearsay. But the question is about authentication, not the content. So the objection is probably about the authentication, not the content. So the sister-in-law can authenticate the letter as being in the uncle's handwriting because she's familiar with it, regardless of the Dead Man's Statute.

But wait, another angle: the Dead Man's Statute might prevent certain witnesses from testifying about specific matters. If the sister-in-law is being asked about a letter that's relevant to the case, and she's related to the nephew, could she be considered an interested party? Or is she just a witness?

I think the key here is that the Dead Man's Statute applies to the parties to the action. The sister-in-law is a witness, not a party. So the statute wouldn't prevent her from testifying about the handwriting. Therefore, the judge would overrule the objection.

Looking at the options, option A says the objection would be overruled because an authenticating witness need not be an expert. That seems correct. The sister-in-law is testifying based on her familiarity, not as an expert. So the objection on the grounds that she's not an expert (option D) would be overruled.

But wait, could the Dead Man's Statute still apply despite that? If the statute excludes her testimony because she's a relative, but I don't think so. The statute typically applies when the witness is the party against the estate. The sister-in-law isn't the one suing; the nephew is.

So the objection would be overruled, making option A correct.

Wait, but what about option J, which says the objection is sustained because of the Dead Man's Statute. If the sister-in-law's testimony about the letter is barred by the statute, then J would be correct. But I'm not sure. The Dead Man's Statute generally prevents a party from testifying about transactions with the deceased. The sister-in-law isn't a party, so it wouldn't apply to her. Therefore, option A is correct because she can authenticate without being an expert.

Wait another point: The Dead Man's Statute might affect the admissibility of the letter's content, but not the authentication. So even if the content is inadmissible, the authentication itself is a separate issue. Therefore, the sister-in-law can testify that the letter is in the uncle's handwriting, regardless of the content.

So, the judge would overrule the objection because she's familiar with the handwriting, making option A correct.

The question revolves around the admissibility of testimony from the sister-in-law regarding the authentication of a letter allegedly written by the deceased uncle. The key issue is whether the Dead Man's Statute applies to her testimony. The Dead Man's Statute generally prevents a party with an interest in the case from testifying about communications or transactions with the deceased. However, the sister-in-law is not a party to the action but rather a witness, and her testimony is limited to authenticating the uncle's handwriting based on her familiarity with it. 

Authentication of handwriting is a separate issue from the content of the document, and under the law, a non-expert witness who is familiar with the handwriting of the person in question can provide such authentication. The Dead Man's Statute does not bar her testimony in this context because she is not testifying about a transaction or communication with the deceased but merely authenticating the handwriting. Therefore, the objection would likely be overruled, as the sister-in-law's testimony is admissible for the purpose of authentication.
