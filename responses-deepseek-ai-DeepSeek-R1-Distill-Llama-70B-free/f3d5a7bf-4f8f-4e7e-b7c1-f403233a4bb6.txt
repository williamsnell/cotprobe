Okay, so I've got this question here about Craig and his statement on an actually infinite number of things. Hmm, let me think. I remember that Craig is associated with the Kalam cosmological argument, right? From what I recall, he argues against the existence of an actual infinite. So the question is asking what Craig says about an actually infinite number of things.

The options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one. 

Option A says they cannot exist. That sounds familiar. I think Craig argues that an actual infinite can't exist in reality because of problems like the Hilbert Hotel paradox, which shows that actual infinities lead to contradictions. So he might say that they cannot exist.

Option B is about physical observation. I'm not sure if Craig's argument is about whether we can observe them or not. I think his point is more about the impossibility of their existence rather than our ability to observe.

Option C suggests they can be counted one by one. Wait, isn't that related to the concept of countable infinities in math? But Craig's stance is more against the actual existence, so I'm not sure this is the right fit.

Option D states it's a concept beyond human comprehension. That doesn't quite fit. Craig's argument is more about the impossibility rather than it being incomprehensible.

Option E: only exists in mathematics. I think Craig would agree that mathematicians use infinities, but he probably argues that these are not actual but potential infinities, or that they don't reflect real existence.

Option F: can only exist in theory. Similar to E, perhaps, but I'm not certain if this is his exact claim.

Option G: is meaningless. That doesn't ring a bell. I think Craig acknowledges infinity as a concept but disputes its actual existence.

Option H: exists somewhere. No, that's the opposite of his position.

Option I: is possible. Again, no, because he argues against the possibility of actual infinity.

Option J: is a paradox. Well, the idea of infinity does lead to paradoxes, but the question is about what Craig says about their existence. He might use paradoxes to argue against their existence, but the statement itself would be about existence, not being a paradox.

So putting it all together, the most likely answer is A: cannot exist. Because Craig's Kalam argument posits that an actual infinite can't exist, leading to the conclusion that the universe must have a beginning.

Craig's argument, as part of the Kalam cosmological argument, centers on the impossibility of an actually infinite number of things existing. He uses examples like the Hilbert Hotel paradox to illustrate the contradictions that arise from the concept of actual infinity. While infinity is a concept used in mathematics, Craig contends that actual infinities cannot exist in reality. Therefore, the correct answer reflects his stance that an actually infinite number of things cannot exist.

Answer: A
