Question:

What data support the theory that short-term memory is essentially auditory?

Options:

A: The theory is supported by the fact that people can remember music better than words.
B: Experiments that reveal short-term memory performs equally well with auditory, visual, and kinesthetic information.
C: Short-term memory does not involve auditory processes.
D: Findings that suggest short-term memory is linked primarily to tactile sensations and the ability to remember textures.
E: Studies indicating that individuals recall visual patterns with higher accuracy than auditory information.
F: Observations that people with better spatial awareness have superior short-term memory.
G: Short-term memory is visual.
H: Research demonstrating that short-term memory capacity is significantly increased when information is presented visually rather than auditorily.
I: Experiments showing auditory recoding in recall process and the detrimental effects of interruptions in rhythmic sequence on recall.
J: Evidence showing a correlation between short-term memory and olfactory senses.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about short-term memory and whether it's essentially auditory. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me start by recalling what I know about memory types.

Short-term memory is often discussed in terms of how information is stored temporarily. I remember something about the modal model of memory, which includes sensory memory, short-term, and long-term. Wait, there's also the idea of different stores, like visual and auditory.

Oh right, there's the concept of auditory and visual short-term memory. Some theories suggest that short-term memory is primarily auditory. But wait, isn't that part of the phonological loop? Like, when we repeat information to ourselves, that's using the phonological store, which is an auditory part of working memory.

So the question is asking what data supports that short-term memory is mainly auditory. The options are A through J. Let me go through each.

Option A: People remember music better than words. Hmm, music is more auditory, but words can be both visual and auditory. Not sure if this directly supports short-term being auditory. Maybe, but not the strongest link.

Option B: Experiments showing equal performance across modalities. That would contradict the idea that it's primarily auditory, so B is not the right answer.

Option C: Doesn't involve auditory processes. That's the opposite of what the theory says, so C is wrong.

Option D: Tactile and textures. That's more about touch, so unrelated to auditory. D is out.

Option E: Better recall of visual patterns. That would support visual short-term memory, not auditory. So E is not it.

Option F: Spatial awareness and short-term. Spatial is more visual, so F doesn't support auditory theory.

Option G: Short-term is visual. Again, opposite of the theory. G is incorrect.

Option H: Better capacity with visual. That's against the theory, so H is no.

Option I: Auditory recoding and rhythmic interruptions affecting recall. Oh, wait, this sounds familiar. I think there's an experiment where if you present auditory information and then interrupt with other sounds, it disrupts recall. Also, the idea that people recode information into auditory form even if it's presented visually. That fits with the idea that short-term is auditory because it relies on phonological storage.

Option J: Olfactory correlation. Smell has nothing to do with this, so J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be I. It's the one that directly ties into how auditory processes are integral to short-term memory. Experiments showing that when you interfere with the auditory aspects, like disrupting a rhythmic sequence, people's recall suffers. Also, the fact that people recode information auditorily supports the theory.

The theory that short-term memory is essentially auditory is supported by experiments showing auditory recoding in the recall process and the detrimental effects of interruptions in rhythmic sequences on recall. This aligns with the idea that short-term memory relies heavily on auditory processes, such as the phonological loop, where information is rehearsed auditorily. 

Answer: I
