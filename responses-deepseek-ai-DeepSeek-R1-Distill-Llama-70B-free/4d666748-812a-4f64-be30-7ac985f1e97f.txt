Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating hysteresis and eddy-current losses for a transformer steel sheet. Hmm, I remember that in transformers, core losses are a combination of hysteresis loss and eddy current loss. So the total core loss is the sum of these two.

The problem gives me data for two frequencies: 30 Hz and 60 Hz. Wait, no, looking again, the table has three rows: for 30 Hz at 8 kG, 60 Hz at 12 kG, and another 30 Hz at 12 kG. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe it's two data points each for two different flux densities. Let me parse the table correctly.

Wait the data is: 

At 30 Hz, 8 kG, loss is 0.135 W/lb.

At 60 Hz, 12 kG, loss is 0.76 W/lb.

At 30 Hz, 12 kG, loss is 0.31 W/lb.

Wait, but I think I'm supposed to calculate the hysteresis and eddy losses for each frequency. So maybe for each frequency, I have two points to determine the constants.

I think hysteresis loss is proportional to the frequency, and eddy loss is proportional to the square of the frequency. So the formula should be something like P = P_h + P_e, where P_h is the hysteresis loss and P_e is the eddy loss.

Hysteresis loss is given by P_h = k_h * f, and eddy loss by P_e = k_e * f². So total loss P = k_h * f + k_e * f².

Wait, but in the data, the flux density varies. Oh right, in the problem statement, the flux density is in kilogauss. So for each frequency, the flux density is different, so that affects the loss.

Wait but wait, the problem statement says "U.S.S. Transformer 52" which I think refers to a specific steel grade, so the material's properties are consistent across the data points.

Wait, but the flux density B seems to vary. So at 30 Hz, it's 8 kG, and at 60 Hz, 12 kG. Also, another data point at 30 Hz, 12 kG.

Wait, perhaps the first two data points are for the same B? Or maybe I need to separate them. Let me think.

Hmm, maybe I should model each frequency's loss as a function of (B), but maybe for each frequency, the flux density is different. Alternatively, perhaps the first and third data points are at the same frequency, just different B.

Wait, perhaps for each frequency, the flux density is different. So for 30 Hz, the B is 8 kG and 12 kG, with corresponding losses 0.135 and 0.31 W/lb. And for 60 Hz, at 12 kG, it's 0.76 W/lb.

Wait, but how can I model this? Because the total loss P is a function of both B and f. So perhaps for each flux level, the loss is calculated as P = (hysteresis term) + (eddy term). But maybe the hysteresis term is proportional to f * B^a, and eddy proportional to f^2 * B^2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the loss can be expressed as P = a * f * B^2 + b * (f B)^2. Hmm, no, I'm a bit stuck on that part.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider that for each frequency, the hysteresis and eddy losses can be determined by the variation with B and f.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure this.

At 30 Hz, B is 8 kG: P = 0.135 W/lb.

At 60 Hz, B is 12 kG: P = 0.76 W/lb.

At 30 Hz, B is 12 kG: P = 0.31 W/lb.

Wait, so for 30 Hz, when B increases from 8 to 12, the loss increases from 0.135 to 0.31. For 60 Hz, at B=12, loss is 0.76.

So perhaps the loss has two components: one that depends on f (hysteresis) and another on f squared (eddy). But I think the loss also depends on B squared for each component.

Wait, more accurately, hysteresis loss is proportional to f * B^a, where a is perhaps around 2, and eddy loss is proportional to (f B)^2, so f² B².

Wait but maybe in this problem, B is the same across the frequencies, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Alternatively, perhaps each frequency has a specific B, so that for each frequency, the loss is the sum of their respective hysteresis and eddy terms.

Hmm, perhaps for each frequency, the loss can be expressed as P = hysteresis coefficient * f + eddy coefficient * f^2.

Wait, but if the flux density varies, perhaps the coefficients include B terms. So maybe:

At a given frequency f, P = (k_h * f) + (k_e * f^2), where k_h and k_e are constants dependent on B.

But in the problem, for 30 Hz, B is 8 kG and 12 kG. So perhaps I can set up two equations for 30 Hz and 60 Hz.

Wait, but wait, for 30 Hz, we have two different B's, so maybe I can model the loss as a function of B and f.

Wait, maybe the problem is expecting me to separate the two losses using the two data points. So for each frequency, the loss is P = hysteresis loss + eddy loss.

But I have two data points for 30 Hz: 30 Hz, 8kG (0.135 W) and 30 Hz, 12 kG (0.31 W). Wait, but that's the same frequency, so f is the same, but B is different. So perhaps I can model this as P = a * f * B^2 + b * (f * B)^2.

Wait, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe the losses scale with B^2, so perhaps for each frequency, the loss is proportional to B^2 times (hysteresis term + eddy term).

Alternatively, perhaps for each B, the loss components can be determined.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the problem expects me to find the hysteresis and eddy losses for each frequency, given the data points. So for each frequency, I have two data points: but wait, no, looking at the data, for 30 Hz, there are two B values, and for 60 Hz, only one.

Wait, perhaps the problem is structured so that at 30 Hz, the B is 8 kG, and at 60 Hz, the B is 12 kG. So perhaps it's two operating points. Then, the third data point is perhaps a typo or another condition.

Wait, the problem says "the table" but the way it's written, perhaps the data is three rows: so the first row is 30 Hz, 8 kG, 0.135 W. The second row is 60 Hz, 12 kG, 0.76 W. The third row is 30 Hz, 12 kG, 0.31 W. So three data points.

Wait, but then perhaps the data points are for the same B but different f. Hmm, perhaps for each B, the loss is measured at two frequencies.

Wait, maybe I should handle each B separately. So for B=8 kG, f=30 Hz, P=0.135. For B=12 kG, f=30 Hz, P=0.31, and for B=12 kG, f=60 Hz, P=0.76.

So for B=12 kG, I have two frequencies: 30 Hz and 60 Hz. So perhaps I can model the loss for B=12 kG as P = a * f + b * f².

So for B=12, f=30: 0.31 = a*30 + b*(30)^2.

At f=60, 0.76 = a*60 + b*(60)^2.

Wait, but that gives me two equations to solve for a and b. Then, using these a and b, I can find the hysteresis (a*f) and eddy (b*f²) losses for each frequency.

But wait, in this approach, a and b are for B=12 kG. But how about for B=8 kG, f=30 Hz, where P=0.135? Maybe I can model it similarly, but perhaps a and b are different for different B. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the hysteresis loss is proportional to f and the eddy loss proportional to f^2, regardless of B. But then, how does B affect the loss?

Wait, perhaps the loss per pound is a function of B^2, so for each B, the loss would scale with B^2 times (hysteresis + eddy terms).

Wait, perhaps the total loss P can be expressed as:

P = (k_h * f) * (B / B_ref)^2 + (k_e * f²) * (B / B_ref)^2

Where B_ref is a reference flux density, say 10 kG. But I'm not sure if this is the approach taken in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that for each B, the hysteresis and eddy losses are proportional to f and f squared, respectively, but scaled by B squared. So:

P = (h * f) * B² + (e * f²) * B².

But again, without knowing h and e, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, perhaps I can use the data points to find h and e.

Looking at B=12 kG, f=30 Hz: P=0.31.

So 0.31 = (h *30) * (12)^2 + (e *30^2) * (12)^2.

Similarly, for f=60 Hz, same B=12 kG: P=0.76.

0.76 = (h *60) *12² + (e *60²)*12².

So now I have two equations:

Equation 1: 0.31 = h*30*(144) + e*900*(144)
Equation 2: 0.76 = h*60*(144) + e*3600*(144)

Simplify:

Equation 1: 0.31 = 4320 h + 129600 e
Equation 2: 0.76 = 8640 h + 518400 e

Now we can solve for h and e.

Let me write them as:

4320 h + 129600 e = 0.31 --> let's call this Eq1

8640 h + 518400 e = 0.76 --> Eq2

Let me try to solve these equations. Maybe multiply Eq1 by 2 to align with Eq2.

Eq1 *2: 8640 h + 259200 e = 0.62 --> Eq3

Now subtract Eq3 from Eq2:

(8640h -8640h) + (518400e -259200e) = 0.76 - 0.62

This gives: 259200 e = 0.14

So e = 0.14 / 259200 ≈ 5.394e-7

Now plug e back into Eq1:

4320 h + 129600*(5.394e-7) = 0.31

Calculate 129600 *5.394e-7 = approx 0.1296 *5.394e-1 = 0.07 (wait, better to compute accurately):

Wait 129600 *5.394e-7 = 129600 * 0.0000005394 = let me compute:

First, 129600 * 5.394 = ?

Well, 1296 *5.394 = ?

Compute 1296 *5 = 6480; 1296 *0.394= approx 1296*(0.3+0.09+0.004)= 388.8 + 116.64 + 5.184= 388.8 + 121.824= 510.624. So total 6480 +510.624=6990.624.

So 129600 *5.394e-7 = 6990.624e-7 = 0.6990624 W? Wait that can't be right. Wait no:

Wait 5.394e-7 is 0.0000005394. So 129600 *0.0000005394 = (1296 * 0.5394) * 1e-4.

Wait 1296 *0.5394: 1296 *0.5=648, 1296 *0.0394= approx 51.0, so total approx 648 +51=699. So 699 *1e-4 = 0.0699.

So 4320 h + 0.0699 = 0.31

So 4320 h = 0.31 - 0.0699 = 0.2401

h = 0.2401 / 4320 ≈ 0.00005559 ≈ 5.559e-5

So now h is about 5.559e-5 and e is 5.394e-7.

These are per (B=12 kG)^2. So now, for each frequency, we can compute hysteresis and eddy losses.

But wait, the problem asks to calculate the hysteresis and eddy losses for each frequency shown in the table. So at 30 Hz and 60 Hz.

Wait, but the given data includes two points at 30 Hz with different B. So perhaps for each frequency, the loss is calculated at a certain B. Wait, perhaps the B is different for each frequency. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the hysteresis and eddy losses for each frequency, regardless of B. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to consider that for each frequency, the hysteresis loss is h*f, and eddy loss is e*f^2, but scaled by B^2. But since B varies with frequency, perhaps each frequency's B is given, so the losses would be calculated accordingly.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the data points are:

At 30 Hz, 8 kG: 0.135 W.

At 60 Hz, 12 kG: 0.76 W.

At 30 Hz, 12 kG: 0.31 W.

Hmm. So perhaps for 30 Hz, there are two B values: 8 and 12 kG, each giving different P.

But for 60 Hz, only B=12 kG is given.

So perhaps the approach is to model the loss for B=12 kG at both 30 Hz and 60 Hz, then find h and e as above.

Wait, but I did that already, solving for h and e, getting h≈5.56e-5 and e≈5.394e-7.

Now, for each frequency, we can compute the hysteresis and eddy losses.

At 30 Hz, B=12 kG:

Hysteresis loss = h * f * B² = (5.56e-5) *30 * (12)^2.

Wait, 12^2 is 144.

So 5.56e-5 *30 = 0.001668.

0.001668 *144 ≈ 0.2401 W. That's the hysteresis loss.

Eddy loss = e * f² * B² = (5.394e-7) * (30)^2 *144.

30^2=900, so 5.394e-7 *900 = 0.00048546.

0.00048546 *144 ≈ 0.0699 W.

So total loss is 0.2401 + 0.0699 ≈ 0.31 W, which matches the data point. Good.

Similarly, at 60 Hz, B=12 kG:

Hysteresis loss =5.56e-5 *60 *144 = ?

5.56e-5 *60 = 0.003336.

0.003336 *144 = 0.48096 W.

Eddy loss =5.394e-7 *60² *144.

60²=3600, so 5.394e-7 *3600=0.0019424.

0.0019424 *144 ≈0.2799 W.

Total loss: 0.48096 + 0.2799 ≈ 0.76086 W, which is close to 0.76 W. So that's correct.

So now, the problem asks to calculate the hysteresis and eddy losses for each of the frequencies shown in the table. The frequencies are 30 and 60 Hz.

Wait, but for 30 Hz, there's another data point at B=8 kG, with loss 0.135 W. So perhaps the question is to find the losses at each frequency, but perhaps each at their respective B.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "calculate the hysteresis and eddy-current losses for each of the frequencies shown in the table."

The table shows 30 Hz at 8 kG, 60 Hz at 12 kG, and 30 Hz at 12 kG. So perhaps the question is to find the hysteresis and eddy losses for the 30 and 60 Hz frequencies, each at their respective B.

So for 30 Hz, B=8 kG: what are the hysteresis and eddy losses?

And for 60 Hz, B=12 kG: what are the losses?

Wait, but how can we find that when we've only determined h and e for B=12 kG. Because the approach I took earlier was using B=12 kG data points.

So perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the h and e are per unit B squared, so I can compute for any B.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the loss at 30 Hz and B=8 kG is given, so we can find h and e for that B.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each B separately.

So for B=8 kG, f=30 Hz, P=0.135.

Assuming P = hysteresis + eddy = (
