Question:

Okay, so I've got this tax problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again carefully.

Vinton exchanged unimproved land for an apartment building in the current year. The land had a basis of $300,000 and a fair market value (FMV) of $420,000. There's a mortgage of $100,000 on the land. The apartment building has an FMV of $550,000 with a mortgage of $230,000. Both parties assumed each other's mortgages. The question is about Vinton's basis in the office building after the exchange.

Hmm, wait, the exchange is about an apartment building, but the question mentions an office building. Oh, maybe that's a typo. Probably should be the apartment building.

So, this is a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the IRS code. In such exchanges, the general rule is that the basis of the property received is the basis of the property given up, adjusted for certain factors like cash or other property received, and liabilities assumed.

Wait, but both parties are assuming each other's mortgages. So, Vinton is giving up land with a $100k mortgage, and taking on a $230k mortgage on the apartment building. So, I need to consider the net liabilities.

Let me think about the formula. The basis in the new property (apartment building) would be the basis of the old property minus any gain or plus any loss recognized, plus any liabilities assumed.

Wait, but in a 1031 exchange, if the FMV of the property received is higher than the basis, there might be a boot situation. But in this case, the FMVs are land $420k and building $550k. So the FMV of the building is higher, but each party is taking the other's mortgage.

Wait, another angle: the total consideration is the FMV of the property each is giving and receiving, but the mortgages affect the basis.

I think the formula for basis when assuming a mortgage is that the basis is adjusted by the amount of the mortgage assumed. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to break it down.

Vinton exchanges land with a basis of $300k for an apartment building. The land's FMV is $420k, and the building's FMV is $550k. But the land has a mortgage of $100k, and the building has a $230k mortgage. Each party assumes the other's mortgage.

So, Vinton is giving up land worth $420k (FMV) and assuming a $230k mortgage. The other party is giving up a building worth $550k and assuming a $100k mortgage.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is to calculate the net effect on Vinton's basis. The basis of the new property is the basis of the old property minus any gain, plus any liabilities assumed.

Wait, no, I think the formula is:

Basis = Basis of old property + Liabilities assumed by Vinton - Liabilities relieved from Vinton.

In this case, Vinton had a $100k mortgage on the land. When he exchanges, he no longer has that liability, so that's a relief of $100k. But he assumes the $230k mortgage on the building. So the net is an increase in liabilities of $230k - $100k = $130k.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is to adjust the basis by the difference in the liabilities. So, when you assume a mortgage, it's like receiving cash, which can affect the basis.

Alternatively, the basis in the new property is calculated as:

Basis = Basis of the old property (land) + (Mortgage assumed on new property) - (Mortgage relieved on old property).

So, that would be $300,000 (basis of land) + $230,000 (assumed mortgage) - $100,000 (relieved mortgage) = $430,000.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach is that the basis is the FMV of the property received minus the gain deferred. But perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, in a 1031 exchange, the basis is the old basis plus any gain not recognized. But if the FMV of the property received is higher than the old basis, and there's a boot (like cash or mortgage), that might trigger gain.

Wait, the total exchange is land with FMV $420k and mortgage $100k for a building with FMV $550k and mortgage $230k. So, perhaps the boot is considered as the difference in the mortgages.

Wait, the mortgages are being exchanged. So Vinton's giving up a $100k mortgage and taking on a $230k mortgage. So the net mortgage increase is $130k, which could be treated as boot received. But since it's a mortgage, it's considered a liability assumed, which affects the basis.

Wait, the formula I remember is that the basis of the new property is the basis of the old property plus the liabilities assumed on the new property minus the liabilities relieved on the old property.

So, Vinton's basis in the new building would be:

$300,000 (basis of land) + $230,000 (assumed mortgage) - $100,000 (relieved mortgage) = $430,000.

Looking at the options, option H is $430,000.

But wait, let me double-check because sometimes the formula is different. Another way: the basis is equal to the FMV of the new property minus the gain deferred.

In this case, the FMV of the land is $420k, and the FMV of the building is $550k. So, the difference is $130k. But considering the mortgages: the net mortgage is $230k assumed and $100k relieved, which is a $130k net increase in liability. So, this $130k is treated as part of the basis.

Wait, perhaps the basis is the FMV of the building minus the gain, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, the basis is the basis of the land plus the net mortgage difference. So, 300k + (230k-100k) = 430k.

Yes, that seems to make sense. So the answer should be H: $430,000.

To determine Vinton's basis in the apartment building, we analyze the exchange under Section 1031 of the IRS code. In a like-kind exchange, the basis of the property received is generally the basis of the property given up, adjusted for liabilities assumed and relieved.

### Key Details:
1. **Vinton's Land**:
   - Basis: $300,000
   - Fair Market Value (FMV): $420,000
   - Mortgage: $100,000

2. **Apartment Building**:
   - FMV: $550,000
   - Mortgage: $230,000

3. **Exchange Terms**:
   - Vinton exchanges the land for the apartment building.
   - Each party assumes the other's mortgage.

### Calculation:
The basis of the new property (apartment building) is calculated as follows:
- **Basis of the old property (land)**: $300,000
- **Liabilities assumed on the new property (apartment building)**: $230,000
- **Liabilities relieved on the old property (land)**: $100,000

The formula is:
\[
\text{Basis of new property} = \text{Basis of old property} + \text{Liabilities assumed} - \text{Liabilities relieved}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Basis of new property} = 300,000 + 230,000 - 100,000 = 430,000
\]

### Conclusion:
Vinton's basis in the apartment building is **$430,000**.
