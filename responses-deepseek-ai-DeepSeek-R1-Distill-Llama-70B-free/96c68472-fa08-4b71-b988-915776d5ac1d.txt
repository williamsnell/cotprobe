Okay, so I need to figure out how to write 11 multiplied by itself 8 times using exponents. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when you multiply the same number several times, you can express that as the base raised to the power of the number of times it's multiplied. 

So, 11 multiplied eight times would be 11^8. Wait, let me count. The question says 11 multiplied seven more times after the first one, right? Because 11•11 is two times, so 11•11•11 would be three. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me see. The question has 11 multiplied 8 times in total. Because it's written as 11•11•11•11•11•11•11•11. Let me count the dots. Each dot is a multiplication, so between the 11s, how many multiplications are there? Well, for n factors, there are (n-1) multiplications. So 8 times 11 would have 7 dots. Wait, no, wait. Wait the question has 8 11s. Because 11 is written 8 times. Let me count: 11, then another 11, and so on, eight times. So that's 11 to the 8th power. So the correct exponent is 8.

Looking at the options, option F is 11^8, which should be the correct answer. Let me make sure I'm not confusing the number of multiplications with the exponent. Oh right, because each multiplication adds one to the exponent. So 11 once is 11^1, 11 twice is 11^2, and so on. So eight 11s would be 11^8. Yes, that makes sense.

The expression 11 multiplied eight times can be written using exponents as 11^8.
