Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about the dimerization of NO2 to N2O4. Hmm, I remember that dimerization means two molecules combining into one. So the reaction is 2 NO2 → N2O4. The problem says it's endothermic, which means it absorbs heat. I'm a bit fuzzy on Le Chatelier's principle, but I think it's about how a system at equilibrium responds to changes.

The question is asking what will increase the amount of N2O4. So I need to think about what shifts the equilibrium to produce more product. Let's go through each option.

Option A: Increasing the size of the reaction vessel. Wait, making the vessel bigger... I think that would lower the pressure because the volume is increasing. If the system is at equilibrium, lower pressure might shift the reaction. Let me think about the moles. On the reactant side, there's 2 moles of NO2, and on the product side, 1 mole of N2O4. So the reaction goes from 2 moles to 1, which reduces the number of moles. So higher pressure favors the formation of N2O4 because it has fewer moles. If I increase the vessel size, the pressure drops. Oh wait, that's the opposite. So lower pressure would favor the side with more moles, which is the reactants (NO2). So this would decrease N2O4. So option A is probably not the right choice.

Option B: Making the reaction vessel smaller. That would increase the pressure, right? Because volume is smaller, same amount of gas would have higher pressure. Since N2O4 side has fewer moles, higher pressure favors product. So this should increase N2O4. So B might be a good option.

Option C: Decreasing the temperature. The reaction is endothermic. Endothermic means ΔH is positive because it absorbs heat. So the equation is 2 NO2 ⇌ N2O4, ΔH positive. If the reaction is endothermic, the reverse is exothermic. Le Chatelier says that if you lower the temperature, the system will shift to release less heat. Wait, no. Wait, for an endothermic reaction, heat is a reactant. Because when you write it as 2 NO2 ⇌ N2O4 + heat? Wait, no. Wait, no, endothermic reactions have heat as a reactant. Because for an endothermic process, the system absorbs heat. So the reaction would be 2 NO2 + heat ⇌ N2O4. So if you decrease the temperature, you're removing heat. So the system will shift to the left to produce more heat, which means more reactants and less product. So this would decrease N2O4. So option C is not correct.

Option D: Adding a non-selective catalyst. A catalyst speeds up the reaction without being consumed. But if it's non-selective, it would speed up both the forward and reverse reactions equally. So the equilibrium isn't affected. So adding a catalyst doesn't change the amount of products or reactants at equilibrium. So D won't help increase N2O4.

Option E: Adding a selective catalyst. Hmm, wait, what's a selective catalyst? Oh, maybe it speeds up only one direction. But catalysts generally are supposed to speed both forward and reverse, but maybe the selective one affects only the forward? I'm not sure. But if a catalyst only affects the rate, not the position of equilibrium, then even a selective catalyst wouldn't change the amount of product. So E probably isn't right.

Option F: Decreasing the pressure in the reaction vessel. Wait, earlier I thought higher pressure favors the product. So decreasing pressure would favor the side with more moles, which is the reactant side. So this would decrease N2O4. So F is not correct.

So the correct option is B, making the vessel smaller, which increases pressure and shifts equilibrium toward N2O4.

To determine which change will increase the amount of N₂O₄ in the reaction 2 NO₂ ⇌ N₂O₄, we apply Le Chatelier's principle. This reaction is endothermic, meaning heat can be treated as a reactant: 2 NO₂ + heat ⇌ N₂O₄. The goal is to shift the equilibrium toward the product side (N₂O₄).

- **Option A**: Increasing the size of the reaction vessel lowers the pressure. Since the reactant side (2 moles of NO₂) has more moles than the product side (1 mole of N₂O₄), decreasing pressure favors the reactants, reducing N₂O₄. This is incorrect.

- **Option B**: Making the reaction vessel smaller increases the pressure. Higher pressure favors the side with fewer moles, which is the product side (N₂O₄). This increases the amount of N₂O₄, making this the correct choice.

- **Option C**: Decreasing the temperature removes heat from the system. Since the reaction is endothermic, removing heat shifts the equilibrium toward the reactants, reducing N₂O₄. This is incorrect.

- **Option D**: Adding a non-selective catalyst speeds up both the forward and reverse reactions equally, not affecting the equilibrium position. This does not increase N₂O₄. Incorrect.

- **Option E**: A selective catalyst might speed up one direction, but even then, it only affects the rate, not the equilibrium amount. This does not increase N₂O₄. Incorrect.

- **Option F**: Decreasing the pressure favors the side with more moles (reactants), reducing N₂O₄. This is incorrect.

The correct answer is **B**, as increasing the pressure by making the reaction vessel smaller shifts the equilibrium toward N₂O₄, increasing its amount.

B
