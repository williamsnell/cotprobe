Okay, so I've got this question about Harlow's monkey experiment, and I need to figure out what it illustrated. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that Harry Harlow did some famous experiments with monkeys, especially rhesus macaques. I think the main focus was on their behavior and development. I've heard terms like "wire mother" and "cloth mother" before. Oh right, he did an experiment where he separated infant monkeys from their biological mothers and gave them surrogate mothers made of wire or cloth.

So the question is, what did this experiment show? The options are A through G. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Language is a uniquely human skill. Hmm, I don't think that's it. Harlow's work was about attachment, not language. I remember other studies, maybe with chimps learning sign language, but that's different.

Option B: The importance of physical contact to development. That sounds familiar. The monkeys preferred the cloth mother, which was warm and provided contact, over the wire one which gave food but wasn't as comfortable. So this might be it.

Option C: Primates have a hierarchy based on physical strength. I think that's more about dominance hierarchies, maybe from someone like Lorenz or studies on chimpanzee societies, not Harlow.

Option D: Monkeys prefer inanimate objects. No, because in the experiment, they actually preferred the cloth mother, which was more animate-like, so this doesn't fit.

Option E: Primates can learn complex tasks. That might be more about problem-solving, like tool use, which I think is more from KÃ¶hler's studies with chimps.

Option F: Primates can recognize themselves in a mirror. That's the mirror self-recognition test, which I believe was done by people like Gallup. So not Harlow.

Option G: Primates can make and use tools. Again, that's more about tool use, which is different. Harlow's work was more about social and emotional development.

Putting it all together, Harlow's experiment showed that physical contact and comfort are crucial for the monkeys' development. The infant monkeys spent more time with the cloth mother, which provided a sense of security, even though the wire mother provided food. So this emphasizes the importance of touch and maternal contact in their development.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.

The correct answer is B.
