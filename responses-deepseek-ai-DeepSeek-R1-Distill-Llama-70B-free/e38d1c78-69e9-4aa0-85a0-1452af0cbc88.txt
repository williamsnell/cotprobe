Okay, so I have this polynomial x³ + 2x² + 2x + 1, and I need to factor it into linear factors in Z_7[x]. Hmm, Z_7 means we're working modulo 7, right? So all the coefficients will be considered modulo 7.

Factoring a cubic polynomial into linear factors means I'm looking for three roots, each corresponding to a linear term (x - a), where a is an element of Z_7. So my goal is to find values a, b, c in Z_7 such that when I plug them into the polynomial, they give zero.

Let me start by listing the elements of Z_7. They are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I'll test each of these by plugging them into the polynomial and see if any of them make it zero modulo 7.

The polynomial is f(x) = x³ + 2x² + 2x + 1.

Let's compute f(0) first. That's easy: 0 + 0 + 0 +1 =1 mod7 is 1, not zero. So 0 isn't a root.

Next, f(1): 1 + 2 + 2 +1 =6. 6 mod7 is 6, not zero. So 1 isn't a root.

Now f(2): plug in x=2. 2³ is 8, 2² is 4. So 8 + 2*4 + 2*2 +1. Wait, let me compute each term modulo7 as I go.

Wait, 2³=8, mod7 is 1. 2x² is 2*(4) = 8 mod7 is 1. 2x is 4. So adding up: 1 +1 +4 +1 =7. 7 mod7 is 0. Oh, so x=2 is a root! Great.

So (x - 2) is a factor. Now I can perform polynomial division to factor it out.

So I need to divide the polynomial by (x-2) in Z_7[x]. Let's set up the division.

The polynomial is x³ + 2x² +2x +1. Dividing by (x-2) is the same as dividing by (x +5) in Z_7 since 2 mod7 is 2 and -2 is 5.

Alternatively, I can use synthetic division with x=2.

Using synthetic division:

Set up the coefficients: 1 (x³), 2 (x²), 2 (x), 1 (constant).

Bring down the 1.

Multiply 1 by 2 (the root), get 2. Add to next coefficient: 2 +2 =4.

Multiply 4 by 2: 8 mod7 is 1. Add to next coefficient: 2 +1=3.

Multiply 3 by2:6. Add to last coefficient:1 +6=7 mod7=0. Perfect, no remainder.

So the quotient polynomial is x² +4x +3.

So now, the polynomial factors into (x-2)(x² +4x +3).

Now I need to factor the quadratic x² +4x +3 in Z_7[x]. Let's see if it factors into linear terms.

To factor x² +4x +3, I can look for two numbers a and b in Z_7 such that a + b =4 (the coefficient of x) and a*b=3 (the constant term).

Let me list all possible pairs of elements in Z_7 that multiply to 3.

Possible pairs (a,b):

1 and 3: 1*3=3. 1+3=4. That's exactly what we need. So a=1, b=3.

So the quadratic factors as (x +1)(x +3). Wait, let me check: (x+1)(x+3) would be x² +4x +3. Yes, because 1+3=4 and 1*3=3.

But wait, in Z_7, 3 is the same as -4, because 3 +4=7≡0 mod7. So alternatively, (x+1)(x+3) is correct.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure: expanding (x+1)(x+3) gives x² + (1+3)x + (1)(3) =x²+4x+3, which matches.

So the full factorization is (x-2)(x+1)(x+3).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see:

Option A: (x − 2)(x + 2)(x − 1) → That would be (x-2)(x+2)(x-1). Hmm, but my factors are (x-2)(x+1)(x+3).

Wait, but in Z_7, 3 is equivalent to -4, because 3 +4=7≡0 mod7. So (x+3) is same as (x-4). So the factors can also be written as (x-2)(x+1)(x-4).

Wait, let me re-express my factors:

(x-2) (x+1) (x+3) → in Z_7 terms, 3 is -4, so (x+3) is (x -4). So the factors become (x-2)(x+1)(x-4).

Looking at the options:

Option B: (x + 1)(x + 4)(x − 2) → So that's (x+1)(x+4)(x-2). Wait, (x+4) is same as (x - 3) in Z_7, because 4 = -3 mod7.

But wait, in my case, the factors are (x+1), (x-4), and (x-2). So let's see the options again.

Option B: (x+1)(x+4)(x-2) → Which is (x+1)(x-3)(x-2). So that's different from my (x+1)(x-4)(x-2).

Option C: (x + 1)(x − 4)(x − 2) → Oh wait, that's exactly what I have. So option C is (x+1)(x-4)(x-2). So that matches.

Wait, but looking back, my quadratic factors as (x+1)(x+3). Since 3 mod7 is 3, but wait, 3 is 3, not -4. Wait, 3 is same as -4? Because 3 +4=7≡0 mod7. So 3 ≡ -4 mod7. So (x+3) is same as (x-4).

So yes, (x+3) is (x-4) in Z_7. So the factorization is (x-2)(x+1)(x-4), which is option C.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option B: (x + 1)(x + 4)(x − 2). That's (x+1)(x+4)(x-2). But (x+4) is (x-3), so those are different roots.

Option C: (x + 1)(x − 4)(x − 2). Yes, that's what I have.

Wait, but wait, in my synthetic division, I found that x=2 is a root. Then the quadratic factors as (x+1)(x+3). But since 3 mod7 is 3, but I could also write 3 as -4. So (x+3) is same as (x-4). So the factors are (x-2)(x+1)(x-4), which is option C.

But wait, let me double-check the factorization.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the synthetic division. Let me redo that quickly.

Polynomial: x³ + 2x² +2x +1.

Divide by (x-2). Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1 | 2 | 2 |1

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 2: 1*2=2. Add to next coefficient: 2+2=4.

Multiply 4 by 2:8 mod7 is 1. Add to next coefficient: 2+1=3.

Multiply 3 by2=6. Add to 1: 1+6=7 mod7=0. So yes, quotient is x² +4x +3.

Factor that into (x+1)(x+3) → which is (x+1)(x-4) in Z_7.

So the factors are (x-2)(x+1)(x-4), which is option C.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is (x+1)(x-4)(x-2). So yes, that's correct. So the answer would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check all options by expanding them.

Let me check option C: (x+1)(x-4)(x-2).

Multiply (x+1)(x-4) first: x² -4x +x -4 = x² -3x -4.

Now multiply by (x-2):

(x² -3x -4)(x-2) = x³ -2x² -3x² +6x -4x +8.

Combine like terms:

x³ + (-2-3)x² + (6-4)x +8 → x³ -5x² +2x +8.

Now, mod7, these coefficients become:

-5 mod7 is 2 (since 7-5=2), 2 remains 2, 8 mod7 is 1.

So the expanded polynomial is x³ +2x² +2x +1, which matches the original. So option C is correct.

Wait, but let me check option B as well, just to be sure.

Option B: (x+1)(x+4)(x-2).

Multiply (x+1)(x+4): x² +5x +4.

Multiply by (x-2): x³ -2x² +5x² -10x +4x -8.

Combine terms: x³ +3x² -6x -8.

Mod7: 3 remains 3, -6 mod7 is 1 (since 7-6=1), -8 mod7 is -1 → 6.

So the polynomial is x³ +3x² +1x +6 mod7. Which is x³ +3x² +x +6. Doesn't match the original, which is x³+2x²+2x+1.

So option B is incorrect.

Option A: (x−2)(x +2)(x −1).

Multiply (x-2)(x+2) = x² -4. Then multiply by (x-1): (x²-4)(x-1) = x³ -x² -4x +4.

Mod7: x³ +6x² +3x +4. Doesn't match.

Option D: (x-1)(x−4)(x−2).

Multiply (x-1)(x-4) =x² -5x +4. Multiply by (x-2): x³ -5x² +4x -2x² +10x -8. Wait, let me compute:

(x² -5x +4)(x-2) = x³ -2x² -5x² +10x +4x -8.

Combine terms: x³ -7x² +14x -8.

Mod7: x³ +0x² +0x -1 → x³ -1. Which is x³ +6 mod7. Doesn't match original.

So yes, option C is correct.

To factor the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_7[x] \), we start by finding its roots in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \). Testing values \( 0, 1, 2, \dots, 6 \), we find that \( x = 2 \) is a root because \( f(2) \equiv 0 \mod 7 \). Thus, \( (x - 2) \) is a factor.

Next, we perform synthetic division to divide \( f(x) \) by \( (x - 2) \), yielding the quadratic polynomial \( x^2 + 4x + 3 \). We then factor \( x^2 + 4x + 3 \) by finding two numbers in \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \) that multiply to 3 and add to 4. The numbers 1 and 3 satisfy these conditions, so the quadratic factors as \( (x + 1)(x + 3) \).

In \( \mathbb{Z}_7 \), \( 3 \) is equivalent to \( -4 \) because \( 3 + 4 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \). Therefore, \( (x + 3) \) can also be written as \( (x - 4) \). The complete factorization of the polynomial is:

\[
f(x) = (x - 2)(x + 1)(x - 4).
\]

Now, we compare this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( (x - 2)(x + 2)(x - 1) \) does not match.
- **Option B**: \( (x + 1)(x + 4)(x - 2) \) does not match because \( (x + 4) \) is not a factor.
- **Option C**: \( (x + 1)(x - 4)(x - 2) \) matches exactly.
- **Option D**: \( (x - 1)(x - 4)(x - 2) \) does not match because \( (x - 1) \) is not a factor.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.
