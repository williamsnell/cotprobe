Question:

In one year Juan earned $30,000. and Don earned $20,000 as free-lance commercial artists. Juan paid $10,000. in taxes. Don paid $6,000. They know that lb + a = T is the linear equation used in computing their tax payments, where I stands for 'income' and T, the amount of tax to be paid. What are the values of the constants a and b?

Options:

A: b = .5, a = -2
B: b = .4, a = 2
C: b = .6, a = - 2
D: b = .1, a = 1
E: b = .4, a = - 2
F: b = .4, a = -3
G: b = .3, a = 0
H: b = .5, a = -1
I: b = .2, a = - 1
J: b = .2, a = -3

Okay, so I have this problem here where Juan and Don earned different amounts as freelance commercial artists, and they paid different taxes. The question is about finding the constants a and b in the linear equation lb + a = T, where I is income and T is the tax.

Wait, wait, I think I should clarify. The equation given is lb + a = T, right? So T equals b times I plus a. Or wait, actually, I think it's T equals b multiplied by income plus a. So it's like a linear tax model where the tax is a function of income.

So Juan earned $30,000 and paid $10,000 in taxes. Don earned $20,000 and paid $6,000. So we can plug these into the equation to form two equations and solve for a and b.

Let me write that down. For Juan: T = 10,000 when I = 30,000. So 10,000 = b * 30,000 + a.

For Don: T = 6,000 when I = 20,000. So 6,000 = b * 20,000 + a.

Now I have a system of two equations:

1) 10,000 = 30,000b + a

2) 6,000 = 20,000b + a

I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate a. Let's do that.

So subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

10,000 - 6,000 = (30,000b + a) - (20,000b + a)

Which simplifies to:

4,000 = 10,000b

So solving for b, I divide both sides by 10,000.

b = 4,000 / 10,000 = 0.4

So b is 0.4.

Now plug b back into one of the equations to find a. Let's use equation 2.

6,000 = 20,000*(0.4) + a

Calculate 20,000 * 0.4: that's 8,000.

So 6,000 = 8,000 + a

Subtract 8,000 from both sides:

a = 6,000 - 8,000 = -2,000.

Wait, so a is -2000? Let's check with equation 1.

Equation 1: 10,000 =30,000*(0.4) + a.

30,000 *0.4 is 12,000. So 12,000 + a =10,000.

a=10,000 -12,000 = -2,000.

Yes, same result. So a is -2000.

Wait, but the options are given with a as a smaller number. Let me look at the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A: b = .5, a = -2

B: b = .4, a = 2

C: b = .6, a = -2

D: b = .1, a = 1

E: b = .4, a = -2

F: b = .4, a = -3

G: b = .3, a = 0

H: b = .5, a = -1

I: b = .2, a = -1

J: b = .2, a = -3

Wait, in our calculation, a is -2000, but the options have a as -2, -3, etc. So maybe the equation is T = (b/100)*I + a? Or perhaps the equation is using a different scale. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are in thousands. Oh, that makes sense. Because 30,000 is written as 30, but in the equation, it's treated as a single unit.

Wait, maybe the variables are in terms of thousands of dollars. So I is in thousands. So for Juan, I is 30 (thousand), T is 10 (thousand). Similarly, Don's I is 20, T is 6.

So the equations are:

10 = 30b + a

6 =20b +a

So now, solving these:

Equation 1: 10 =30b +a

Equation 2:6=20b +a

Subtract equation 2 from 1:

4 =10b → b=0.4.

Then plug into equation 2:

6=20*(0.4)+a →6=8+a →a= -2.

So a is -2 and b is 0.4. So looking at the options, option E is b=0.4, a=-2.

So the answer should be option E.

To solve for the constants \( a \) and \( b \) in the linear equation \( T = bI + a \), where \( T \) represents the tax paid and \( I \) represents income, we use the given data:

1. Juan earned $30,000 and paid $10,000 in taxes:
   \[
   10,000 = 30,000b + a
   \]

2. Don earned $20,000 and paid $6,000 in taxes:
   \[
   6,000 = 20,000b + a
   \]

Subtracting the second equation from the first to eliminate \( a \):
\[
10,000 - 6,000 = (30,000b + a) - (20,000b + a)
\]
\[
4,000 = 10,000b
\]
\[
b = \frac{4,000}{10,000} = 0.4
\]

Now substitute \( b = 0.4 \) into the second equation to solve for \( a \):
\[
6,000 = 20,000(0.4) + a
\]
\[
6,000 = 8,000 + a
\]
\[
a = 6,000 - 8,000 = -2,000
\]

Thus, \( b = 0.4 \) and \( a = -2 \). Comparing these values with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**E: \( b = 0.4, a = -2 \)**.
