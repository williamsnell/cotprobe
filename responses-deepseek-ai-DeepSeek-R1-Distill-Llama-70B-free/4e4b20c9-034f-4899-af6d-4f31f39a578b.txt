Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says: A 10-N force at an angle of 45 degrees above the horizontal has a horizontal component of about... and then there are the options from A to J.

Hmm, right, I remember that when a force is applied at an angle, it can be broken down into horizontal and vertical components. The horizontal component is usually found using cosine, and the vertical using sine. Wait, why is that again? Oh right, because the adjacent side in the right triangle is the horizontal component, so cosine of the angle equals adjacent over hypotenuse. So the horizontal component should be F times cosine(theta).

Let me think about the angle. It's 45 degrees. I remember that for 45-45-90 triangles, the sides are in a specific ratio. The legs are equal, and each is (sqrt(2)/2) times the hypotenuse. So cos(45°) is sqrt(2)/2, which is approximately 0.7071.

So the force is 10 N. Multiplying that by cos(45) gives the horizontal component. Let me calculate that. 10 N times 0.7071 is about... 7.071 N. Hmm, but let me double-check. 10 times 0.7 is 7, and 0.0071 is a small addition, so yeah, around 7.071. 

Wait, but I'm looking at the options. The options are A:6, B:20, C:15, etc. So 7.071 is approximately 7 N. Let me look at the options again. Option I is 7 N. That should be the correct answer.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the angle is 45 degrees above the horizontal, so that part is correct. Because if it's above, the horizontal component is still adjacent. So yes, F_x = F * cos(theta). So 10 * cos(45) is correct.

I can also think about it another way. If I have a 10 N force at 45 degrees, the components should be equal because in a 45-45-90 triangle, both legs are the same. So both the horizontal and vertical components are 10 * (sqrt(2)/2), which is 7.071 each. So that's about 7 N, which matches option I.

Wait, but in the options, I see option E is 12 N and option G is 9 N. Did I miscalculate something? Let me recalculate. 10 times 0.7071 equals 7.071. Oh, right, the options have option I as 7 N, which is the closest. So that's the answer.

I don't think I made a mistake here. So the answer should be I:7 N.

The horizontal component of a force applied at an angle can be calculated using the formula:

\[
F_x = F \cdot \cos(\theta)
\]

Here, \( F = 10 \, \text{N} \) and \( \theta = 45^\circ \). The cosine of \( 45^\circ \) is approximately \( 0.7071 \). Substituting these values:

\[
F_x = 10 \cdot 0.7071 \approx 7.071 \, \text{N}
\]

This value rounds to approximately \( 7 \, \text{N} \). Among the given options, the closest match is **7 N**, which corresponds to option **I**.
