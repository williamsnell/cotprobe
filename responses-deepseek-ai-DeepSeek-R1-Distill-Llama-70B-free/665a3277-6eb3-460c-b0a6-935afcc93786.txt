Question:

A salesman for the Filler Brush Company is compensated for his auto costs at a rate of 8\textcent a mile. His fixed costs are $500 and he has a variable cost of 5\textcent a mile. How many miles would he have to travel in order to break even (cover expenses), yet still earn no profit over fixed costs?

Options:

A: 30,000 miles
B: 18,000 miles
C: 14,000 miles
D: 15,000 miles
E: 12,500 miles
F: 16,667 miles
G: 20,000 miles
H: 25,000 miles
I: 17,500 miles
J: 22,000 miles

Okay, so I have this problem here about a salesman who needs to figure out how many miles he has to travel to break even. Hmm, break-even analysis, right? I remember that the break-even point is where the total revenue equals the total costs, so no profit, no loss. 

Let me read the problem again. The salesman is compensated at 8 cents a mile for his auto costs. His fixed costs are $500, and variable costs are 5 cents a mile. Wait, so the compensation is like revenue he gets per mile, and the variable cost is what he spends per mile. So the profit per mile would be the difference between those two?

Right, so for each mile he drives, he gets 8 cents from the company as compensation. But he has a variable cost of 5 cents per mile. So the contribution per mile is 8c -5c =3 cents per mile. That makes sense. 

His fixed costs are $500. So to find the break-even point, I need to find out how many miles he needs to drive so that the total contribution covers the fixed costs. 

So the formula should be: Break-Even in miles = Fixed Costs / Contribution per mile.

Wait, fixed costs are $500, which is 500 dollars. But the contribution is 3 cents per mile. Oh wait, I need to convert them to the same units. Let's convert dollars to cents to make it easier. So $500 is 50,000 cents. 

Then, contribution per mile is 3 cents. So the miles needed would be 50,000 cents divided by 3 cents per mile. Let me do that calculation: 50,000 / 3 is approximately 16,666.666... miles. 

Looking at the options, F is 16,667 miles. That should be the correct answer. 

Wait, let me double-check. So for each mile, he makes 3 cents. So 16,667 miles would give him 16,667 * 3 = 50,001 cents, which is $500.01. That's just over the fixed costs, so that's the break-even point. So yes, F is right.

To determine how many miles the salesman needs to travel to break even, we need to calculate the point where his total revenue equals his total costs. The salesman is compensated at a rate of 8 cents per mile, and his variable cost is 5 cents per mile. The contribution per mile is therefore:

\[
\text{Contribution per mile} = 8\text{ cents} - 5\text{ cents} = 3\text{ cents}.
\]

The fixed costs are $500, which is equivalent to 50,000 cents. The break-even point in miles is calculated by dividing the fixed costs by the contribution per mile:

\[
\text{Break-Even Miles} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Contribution per mile}} = \frac{50,000 \text{ cents}}{3 \text{ cents per mile}} \approx 16,667 \text{ miles}.
\]

From the given options, the closest value is 16,667 miles, which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
