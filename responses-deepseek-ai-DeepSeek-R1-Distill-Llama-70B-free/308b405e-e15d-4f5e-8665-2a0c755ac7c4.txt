Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an electron in a three-dimensional rectangular box. Hmm, I remember that the energy levels in such a box are quantized. The question says the electron transitions from the lowest-lying excited state to the ground state, and I need to find the frequency of the emitted photon. 

Wait, let me think. The ground state would be the lowest energy level, which is (1,1,1). The lowest-lying excited state would be the next higher energy level. I need to figure out what that is. So, in a 3D box, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each dimension: nx, ny, nz. The energy is given by E = (h²/(8m)) * [(nx²/Lx²) + (ny²/Ly²) + (nz²/Lz²)], where Lx, Ly, Lz are the box dimensions. 

Wait, actually, the formula uses the square of each quantum number divided by the square of each dimension. So the energy depends on the sum of (n_i)^2 / (L_i)^2 for each dimension. 

The ground state is (1,1,1), so the first excited state would be the next possible combination. What's the next possible? It can't be (2,1,1) because that would have higher energy than some others. Wait, no, maybe I should list the possible states in order of increasing energy.

Let me see: the possible states are combinations of (n_x, n_y, n_z). The next states after (1,1,1) would be where one of the n's is 2, and the others are 1. So the possible excited states are (2,1,1), (1,2,1), (1,1,2). Then compare their energies to see which is the lowest.

Let's compute their energies. Wait, but the dimensions are different: 5, 3, 6 angstroms. So the energy contribution from each dimension will vary because they are divided by Lx², Ly², Lz². So the energy for each state will be:

E = (h²/(8m)) * [ (n_x²)/(Lx²) + (n_y²)/(Ly²) + (n_z²)/(Lz²) ]

So for the ground state (1,1,1):

E_111 = (h²/(8m)) [1/(5)^2 + 1/(3)^2 + 1/(6)^2 ]

Wait, let's calculate each term:

1/(5^2) = 1/25 = 0.04

1/(3^2) = 1/9 ≈0.1111

1/(6^2) = 1/36 ≈0.0278

Adding them: 0.04 + 0.1111 + 0.0278 ≈0.1789. So E_111 is proportional to 0.1789.

Now, the first excited states:

State (2,1,1):

n_x=2, others 1.

So for Lx=5, term is 4/(25) = 0.16.

ny=1, Ly=3: 1/9 ≈0.1111.

nz=1, Lz=6: 0.0278.

Sum: 0.16 + 0.1111 + 0.0278 = 0.2989.

So E_211 is proportional to 0.2989.

State (1,2,1):

nx=1, ny=2, nz=1.

So 1/25 = 0.04.

4/(3^2)=4/9≈0.4444.

1/36≈0.0278.

Sum: 0.04 + 0.4444 + 0.0278 = 0.5122.

So E_121 is proportional to 0.5122.

State (1,1,2):

nx=1, ny=1, nz=2.

1/25=0.04.

1/9≈0.1111.

4/(36)=0.1111.

Sum: 0.04 + 0.1111 + 0.1111 = 0.2622.

So E_112 is proportional to 0.2622.

Comparing the three excited states: E_211 has 0.2989, E_121 has 0.5122, E_112 has 0.2622.

So the lowest among these is E_112 (0.2622) and E_211 (0.2989). So the order is E_112 < E_211 < E_121. So the lowest-lying excited state is (1,1,2), meaning the transition is from (1,1,2) to (1,1,1). 

Wait, no, the question says the transition is from the lowest-lying excited state to the ground state. So initial state is (1,1,2), final state is (1,1,1). So the energy difference is E_initial - E_final.

Wait, no, when the electron transitions from excited to ground state, it emits a photon, so initial is higher energy (excited), final is lower (ground). So the energy of the photon is E_excited - E_ground.

So E_photon = E_112 - E_111.

Wait, let me compute the energies. Since the energy is proportional to the sum S, the energy difference would be proportional to (S_112 - S_111).

S_111 is 0.1789, S_112 is 0.2622.

So delta_S = 0.2622 - 0.1789 = 0.0833.

Then, E_photon = (h²/(8m)) * (delta_S) * (some factors).

Wait, but to compute this, I think I should calculate the actual energy difference using the formula. Let me get the constants right.

The energy levels are given by E = (h²/(8m)) * [(n_x²/Lx²) + (n_y²/Ly²) + (n_z²/Lz²)].

But the values of Lx, Ly, Lz are in angstroms. Wait, but in physics, we usually use meters. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters.

So Lx =5e-10 m, Ly=3e-10 m, Lz=6e-10 m.

Now, h is Planck's constant. Let me recall its value. h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

Mass of electron m is 9.11e-31 kg.

So putting this all together.

E = (h²/(8m)) * [ (n_x²)/(Lx²) + (n_y²)/(Ly²) + (n_z²)/(Lz²) ]

So for the transition from (1,1,2) to (1,1,1), the change in energy is ΔE = E_112 - E_111.

Compute each term:

E_111:

n_x=1, Lx=5e-10: (1)/(5e-10)^2 = 1/(25e-20) = 4e+18 (since 1/25 is 0.04, 1e20/25 = 4e18? Wait, 5e-10 squared is 25e-20, so 1/25e-20 = 4e+18? Wait, 1/(25e-20) = (1/25) * 1e20 = 0.04e20 = 4e18 m^-2.

Similarly, for Ly=3e-10: 1/(3e-10)^2=1/(9e-20)≈1.111e+19 m^-2.

For Lz=6e-10: 1/(6e-10)^2=1/(36e-20)=2.778e+18 m^-2.

Wait wait, no: 1/(3e-10)^2 is 1/(9e-20 m²) ) = (1/9) * 1e20 = approx 1.111e19 m^-2.

So for E_111, the sum is:

(1/(5e-10)^2) + (1/(3e-10)^2) + (1/(6e-10)^2) ) 

= (4e18) + (1.111e19) + (2.778e18) 

Let me compute that:

Convert to same exponent: 4e18 is 0.4e19, 2.778e18 is 0.2778e19.

So sum is 0.4e19 + 1.111e19 + 0.2778e19 = (0.4 + 1.111 + 0.2778) e19 

Adding up: 0.4 +1.111 is 1.511, +0.2778 is ~1.7888e19 m^-2.

Similarly, for E_112:

n_z is 2, so (2)^2 =4, so the term is 4/(6e-10)^2 = 4/(36e-20) = (4/36) * 1e20 = (1/9) *1e20 ≈1.111e19 m^-2.

So the terms for E_112:

(1/(5e-10)^2) + (1/(3e-10)^2) + (4/(6e-10)^2) 

= 4e18 + 1.111e19 + 1.111e19 

Wait, wait, 4/(6e-10)^2 = (4)/(36e-20) )= (1)/(9e-20) )= approx 1.111e19.

So E_112 sum is 4e18 +1.111e19 +1.111e19.

Again, 4e18 is 0.4e19.

Sum: 0.4e19 +1.111e19 +1.111e19 = (0.4 + 2.222)e19 = 2.622e19 m^-2.

So the difference (E_112 - E_111) is (2.622e19 - 1.7888e19) = 0.8332e19 m^-2.

Wait, no, sorry, the E is proportional to the sum, but the actual E is (h²/(8m)) multiplied by that sum.

So ΔE = (h²/(8m)) * (sum_112 - sum_111) 

sum_112 is 2.622e19, sum_111 is 1.7888e19, so delta_sum is 0.8332e19 m^-2.

So ΔE = (h²/(8m)) * 0.8332e19.

Compute h squared: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J²s².

Then 8m is 8 *9.11e-31 kg = 7.288e-30 kg.

So h²/(8m) = 4.39e-67 /7.288e-30 = approx 6.026e-38 J·m².

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

6.626e-34 squared: (6.626)^2 is about 43.9, so 43.9e-68 = 4.39e-67 J²s².

8m = 8 *9.11e-31 =72.88e-31=7.288e-30 kg.

So 4.39e-67 /7.288e-30 = (4.39/7.288) * 1e-37.

4.39/7.288 is approximately 0.602.

So 0.602e-37 = 6.02e-38 J·m².

So ΔE = 6.02e-38 J·m² * 0.8332e19 m^-2.

Multiply them: 6.02e-38 * 0.8332e19 = ?

6e-38 * 8.33e18 = 6*8.33= ~50, and 1e-38 *1e18=1e-20.

So approximately 50e-20 = 5e-19 J.

Wait, let me compute it accurately.

6.02e-38 * 0.8332e19 = (6.02 * 0.8332) * 1e(-38+19) ) 

6.02 * 0.8332 ≈5.02.

So 5.02e-19 J.

So ΔE ≈5.02e-19 J.

Now, the photon's energy E_photon = h * f, where f is the frequency.

So f = E_photon / h.

E_photon is 5.02e-19 J.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So f = (5.02e-19) / (6.626e-34) = (5.02 /6.626 ) * 1e( -19 +34 ) )

5.02 /6.626 is approx 0.758.

So 0.758e15 = 7.58e14 s^-1.

Looking at the options, option B is 7.58e14, which matches.

To solve the problem, we consider an electron in a three-dimensional rectangular box with dimensions \( L_x = 5.00 \, \text{Å} \), \( L_y = 3.00 \, \text{Å} \), and \( L_z = 6.00 \, \text{Å} \). The energy levels are quantized and given by:

\[
E = \frac{h^2}{8m} \left( \frac{n_x^2}{L_x^2} + \frac{n_y^2}{L_y^2} + \frac{n_z^2}{L_z^2} \right),
\]

where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are quantum numbers, \( h \) is Planck's constant, and \( m \) is the mass of the electron.

### Step 1: Identify the ground and excited states
- The ground state corresponds to \( (n_x, n_y, n_z) = (1, 1, 1) \).
- The lowest-lying excited state is the next energy level, which occurs when one quantum number increases to 2 while the others remain 1. Possible states are \( (2, 1, 1) \), \( (1, 2, 1) \), and \( (1, 1, 2) \).

### Step 2: Compute the energies of the states
Using the formula for \( E \), we calculate the energy contributions from each dimension:

1. **Ground state \( (1, 1, 1) \):**
   \[
   E_{111} \propto \frac{1}{L_x^2} + \frac{1}{L_y^2} + \frac{1}{L_z^2} = \frac{1}{(5)^2} + \frac{1}{(3)^2} + \frac{1}{(6)^2} = 0.04 + 0.1111 + 0.0278 = 0.1789.
   \]

2. **Excited states:**
   - \( (2, 1, 1) \): \( \frac{4}{(5)^2} + \frac{1}{(3)^2} + \frac{1}{(6)^2} = 0.16 + 0.1111 + 0.0278 = 0.2989 \).
   - \( (1, 2, 1) \): \( \frac{1}{(5)^2} + \frac{4}{(3)^2} + \frac{1}{(6)^2} = 0.04 + 0.4444 + 0.0278 = 0.5122 \).
   - \( (1, 1, 2) \): \( \frac{1}{(5)^2} + \frac{1}{(3)^2} + \frac{4}{(6)^2} = 0.04 + 0.1111 + 0.1111 = 0.2622 \).

The lowest-lying excited state is \( (1, 1, 2) \), as it has the smallest energy contribution \( (0.2622) \).

### Step 3: Compute the energy difference
The energy difference between the lowest-lying excited state \( (1, 1, 2) \) and the ground state \( (1, 1, 1) \) is:

\[
\Delta E \propto \Delta S = S_{112} - S_{111} = 0.2622 - 0.1789 = 0.0833.
\]

The actual energy difference is:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{h^2}{8m} \cdot \Delta S,
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \), and \( \Delta S = 0.0833 \). Substituting:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \cdot 9.11 \times 10^{-31}} \cdot 0.0833.
\]

1. Compute \( h^2 \):  
   \[
   h^2 = (6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2 = 4.39 \times 10^{-67} \, \text{J}^2 \cdot \text{s}^2.
   \]

2. Compute \( 8m \):  
   \[
   8m = 8 \cdot 9.11 \times 10^{-31} = 7.288 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

3. Compute \( \frac{h^2}{8m} \):  
   \[
   \frac{h^2}{8m} = \frac{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}{7.288 \times 10^{-30}} = 6.02 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{J·m}^2.
   \]

4. Compute \( \Delta E \):  
   \[
   \Delta E = 6.02 \times 10^{-38} \cdot 0.083
