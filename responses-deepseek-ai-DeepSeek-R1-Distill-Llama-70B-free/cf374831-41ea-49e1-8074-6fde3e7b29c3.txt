Okay, so I have this graph problem here, and I need to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 6. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should understand the structure of the graph. The edges are given as E = {<1,2>, <2,4>, <5,4>, <5,6>}. So, each pair represents an undirected edge between two nodes. Let me list out the connections each node has.

Node 1 is connected to node 2.
Node 2 is connected to node 1 and node 4.
Node 4 is connected to node 2 and node 5.
Node 5 is connected to node 4 and node 6.
Node 6 is connected to node 5.

So the graph looks like this:

1 - 2 - 4 -5 -6
Also, 5 is connected to 6, and 4 is connected to 5.

Now, I need to find the shortest path from 1 to 6. The shortest path would be the one with the least number of edges. Since the graph is undirected, I can move in any direction.

Let me try to map out possible paths.

Starting at 1. From 1, I can go to 2. So let's explore that path first.

1 -> 2. Now from 2, where can I go? Back to 1 (but that's where I came from, so probably not helpful) or to 4.

So now I'm at 4. From 4, the connections are to 2 and 5. 2 is where I came from, so I go to 5.

Now at 5. From 5, I can go to 4 (again, came from there) or 6. Oh, 6 is the target. So the path so far is 1-2-4-5-6. That's four edges, so a path length of 4.

Wait, but let me check if there's a shorter path. Are there any other connections I'm missing?

Looking back at the edges, node 5 is connected to 4 and 6. So from 5, the direct path to 6 is one edge. So my path is 1->2->4->5->6.

Wait, is there a way to get from 2 to 5 directly? Looking at the edges, 2 is connected to 4, and 4 is connected to 5. So no direct edge between 2 and 5. So the path through 4 is necessary.

Hmm, another path option: what if I go from 1 to 2, then to 4, then to 5, then to 6. That's the same as before.

Wait, are there any other nodes I'm missing? Let me check. The nodes are 1,2,4,5,6. No, that's all.

Is there a shorter path with fewer steps? Let me think. Maybe another route.

Wait, what if I go from 1 to 2, then 2 to 4, then 4 to 5, then 5 to 6. Oh, that's the same path as before. So that's four steps.

Alternatively, is there a way to get from 2 to 5 without going through 4? No, because from 2, the only other node is 4. So no alternative.

So the path is 1-2-4-5-6, which is four edges. Let me count the nodes: 1,2,4,5,6. So the list would be [1,2,4,5,6], which is option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options again. Option C is [1,2,4,5,6], which is what I have. But wait, looking at the options again:

Option J is [1,2,4,6], but wait, is 4 connected to 6? Let me check the edges. The edges are <2,4>, <5,4>, <5,6>. So 4 is connected to 5, but not directly to 6. So no, 4 isn't connected to 6. So option J is invalid because there's no edge between 4 and 6. So that path isn't possible.

Wait, so option C is a valid path. Are there any other paths that are the same length or shorter?

Wait, another thought. What if there's a path that skips some steps. Let me think: from 1 to 2, then 2 to 4, then 4 to 5, then 5 to 6. That's four edges. Alternatively, is there a way to go from 1 to 2, then to 4, then to 5, then to 6. That's the same.

Wait, what about another approach: perhaps from 1 to 2, then 2 to 4, then 4 to 5, then 5 to 6. So same as before, no alternative.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me think if there's a way to get from 1 to 5 directly. No, because the edges don't include <1,5>. So the only way is through 2 and 4.

So the shortest path is indeed 1-2-4-5-6. So the list is [1,2,4,5,6], which is option C.

Wait, but wait, let me check the options again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: [1,2,4,5,6]

Option J: [1,2,4,6] → But 4 and 6 aren't connected, so J isn't possible.

Option D: [1,2,5,4,6] → Let's see. From 2 to 5? Are 2 and 5 connected? No. Because edges don't include <2,5>. So that path isn't possible.

Option E: [1,2,5,6] → Again, from 2 to 5 is not a direct edge.

Option G: [1,2,4,5,4,5,6] → That's longer than necessary, so not the shortest.

Option H: [1,5,6] → 1 and 5 aren't connected directly.

Option I: [1,2,6] → 2 and 6 aren't connected.

So the only valid path is option C, which is [1,2,4,5,6]. So I think that's the correct answer.

To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 6 in the given undirected graph, we first analyze the connections:

- Node 1 is connected to node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1 and node 4.
- Node 4 is connected to node 2 and node 5.
- Node 5 is connected to node 4 and node 6.
- Node 6 is connected to node 5.

Starting from node 1, the possible path is as follows:

1. From node 1, move to node 2.
2. From node 2, move to node 4.
3. From node 4, move to node 5.
4. From node 5, move to node 6.

This results in the path `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`, which has 4 edges and is the shortest path.

Now, we evaluate the options:

- **Option A**: `[1, 5, 4, 6]` → Invalid, as there is no direct edge between node 1 and node 5.
- **Option B**: `[1, 5, 4, 2, 6]` → Invalid, as there is no direct edge between node 1 and node 5.
- **Option C**: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]` → Valid and matches the shortest path.
- **Option D**: `[1, 2, 5, 4, 6]` → Invalid, as there is no direct edge between node 2 and node 5.
- **Option E**: `[1, 2, 5, 6]` → Invalid, as there is no direct edge between node 2 and node 5.
- **Option F**: `[1, 2, 4, 5]` → Does not reach node 6.
- **Option G**: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6]` → Longer than necessary.
- **Option H**: `[1, 5, 6]` → Invalid, as there is no direct edge between node 1 and node 5.
- **Option I**: `[1, 2, 6]` → Invalid, as there is no direct edge between node 2 and node 6.
- **Option J**: `[1, 2, 4, 6]` → Invalid, as there is no direct edge between node 4 and node 6.

The correct answer is **Option C: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]**.

C
