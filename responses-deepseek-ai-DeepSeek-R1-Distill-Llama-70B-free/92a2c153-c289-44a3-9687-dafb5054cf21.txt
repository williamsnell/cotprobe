Okay, so I've got this problem here about a water bed being sold either for cash or on a payment plan, and I need to find the annual interest rate charged. Hmm, I remember that this is probably related to simple interest or maybe something like APR calculations. Let's think it through.

The cash price is $330. The payment plan is $40 down and then $10.50 a month for 36 months. So first, I should figure out the total amount paid under the payment plan. 

Wait, the down payment is $40, and then 36 monthly payments of $10.50. So the total amount paid would be 40 plus (36 times 10.50). Let me calculate that. 36 times 10.50 is... let's see, 36 * 10 is 360, and 36 * 0.5 is 18, so total is 360 + 18 = 378. Then add the down payment: 40 + 378 = 418. So the total paid is $418.

But the cash price is $330. So the extra amount paid is 418 - 330 = $88. This $88 must be the interest paid over the 3 years.

Now, I need to find the annual interest rate. So this is probably a simple interest problem because the payment plan is spread out over time.

In simple interest, the formula is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal, r is the rate, and t is time in years.

Wait, but wait. The principal here would be the cash price, which is $330, right? Because that's the amount you're paying interest on. Or is it the present value?

Alternatively, maybe it's the amount financed. So the down payment is $40, so the amount financed is 330 - 40 = $290. Hmm, but wait, no, because the total paid is $418, which includes the principal plus interest. So the principal would be the cash price minus the down payment, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the amount financed is the cash price minus the down payment, so 330 - 40 = $290. Then, the total payments are 36 * 10.50 = 378, which would be the interest plus principal. So the interest is 378 - 290 = $88. So that aligns with what I had earlier.

So the interest is $88, the principal is $290, and the time is 3 years. So using I = P*r*t, rearranged to solve for r: r = I/(P*t).

So plugging in the numbers: 88 / (290 * 3) = 88 / 870. Let me calculate that. 88 divided by 870. Let's see, 870 divided by 88 is about 9.886, so 1/9.886 is approximately 0.1011. So 0.1011 is about 10.11% per year.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, the options are A:14.9%, B:16.3%, etc. So my calculation must be wrong somewhere.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm using the wrong principal. Because the payment plan includes monthly payments, so maybe the interest isn't simple interest but rather being calculated in another way, like the internal rate of return or something similar. Because in the case of an installment loan, each payment includes both principal and interest, so the outstanding balance decreases each month, which would make it an amortizing loan. So maybe I need to calculate the effective interest rate using the present value of all payments.

Ah, right, I think I should model this as a simple loan where each payment is made at the end of each month, and the present value of all those monthly payments plus the down payment should equal the cash price.

Wait, but the cash price is $330, and the down payment is $40, so the amount financed is $330 - $40 = $290. The monthly payments are $10.50 for 36 months. So the present value of these 36 monthly payments of $10.50 should be equal to $290 when discounted at the monthly interest rate. Then, we can find the monthly rate and multiply by 12 to get the annual rate.

So the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r], where PV is the present value (which is $290), PMT is the monthly payment ($10.50), r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods (36 months).

So the equation is 290 = 10.50 * [(1 - (1 + r)^-36) / r]. I need to solve for r.

This is a bit tricky because it's not a straightforward algebraic solution; it's an equation that might require trial and error or using a financial calculator. Alternatively, I can approximate it by trying different interest rates from the options and see which one gets me close to 290.

Let me try option A: 14.9% annual rate. That's a monthly rate of 14.9% / 12 ≈ 1.245% per month. Let's plug that into the equation.

First, calculate (1 + r)^-36. r=0.01245, so 1.01245^-36. Let's approximate this. Using the formula 1/(1.01245)^36. Let me compute (1.01245)^36 first. Using logarithms might help, but maybe I can approximate:

We know that (1 + r)^n ≈ e^(rn) for small r, but it's better to compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the present value factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an iterative approach. Let's compute the denominator first.

Wait, let me compute the value inside the brackets: (1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r.

If r is 0.01245 (1.245%), n=36.

So (1.01245)^36 ≈ let's compute it approximately. Let me compute ln(1.01245)= approx 0.01235. Multiply by 36: 0.01235 * 36 ≈ 0.4446. So e^0.4446 ≈ 1.560. So (1.01245)^36 ≈ 1.56, so 1/1.56 ≈ 0.641.

So 1 - 0.641 = 0.359. Then divide by 0.01245: 0.359 / 0.01245 ≈ 28.85.

Multiply by PMT of 10.50: 10.50 * 28.85 ≈ 303. So the present value would be about 303, which is higher than 290. So the interest rate is too low, because the present value is higher than 290. So the actual rate must be higher than 14.9% annual.

Let's try option B: 16.3% annual. Monthly rate is 16.3 / 12 ≈ 1.358% per month.

Compute (1.01358)^36. Let's approximate. Let me compute ln(1.01358)= approx 0.0135. Multiply by 36: 0.486. e^0.486 is about 1.626. So (1.01358)^36 ≈ 1.626, so 1/1.626 ≈ 0.615.

So 1 - 0.615 = 0.385. Divide by 0.01358: 0.385 / 0.01358 ≈ 28.35.

Multiply by 10.50: 10.50 * 28.35 ≈ 298. So present value is about 298, which is still higher than 290. So rate still too low. Need a higher rate.

Option C: 18.2%. Monthly rate is 18.2/12 ≈ 1.5167%. Let's compute.

r=0.015167.

(1.015167)^36. Compute ln(1.015167)= approx 0.015. Multiply by 36: 0.54. e^0.54 ≈ 1.716. So 1/(1.716) ≈ 0.5827.

1 - 0.5827 = 0.4173. Divide by 0.015167: 0.4173 / 0.015167 ≈ 27.51.

Multiply by PMT 10.50: 10.50 *27.51≈ 289. So present value is around 289, which is very close to 290. That's pretty close. So the rate must be around 18.2% annual.

But wait, the present value was 289 when using 18.2%, which is very close to 290. So maybe the correct answer is option C: 18.2%.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check another option to see if it's closer. Let's try option D:19.7% annual. Monthly rate is 19.7/12 ≈ 1.6417%.

Compute (1.016417)^36.

ln(1.016417)≈0.0163. Multiply by 36: 0.5868. e^0.5868≈1.798. So 1/1.798≈0.556.

1 -0.556=0.444. Divide by 0.016417: 0.444 / 0.016417≈27.02.

Multiply by 10.50: 10.50 *27.02≈283.71. So present value is 283.71, which is less than 290. So the rate is higher than needed, so 18.2% is closer.

Wait, but when I calculated 18.2%, the present value was 289, which is very close to 290. So 18.2% is the correct answer, which is option C.

To determine the annual interest rate charged for the payment plan, we compare the cash price of the water bed ($330) to the total amount paid under the payment plan. The payment plan requires a $40 down payment and 36 monthly payments of $10.50. 

First, calculate the total amount paid under the payment plan:

\[
\text{Total Amount Paid} = \text{Down Payment} + (\text{Number of Payments} \times \text{Monthly Payment})
\]
\[
\text{Total Amount Paid} = 40 + (36 \times 10.50) = 40 + 378 = 418.
\]

The cash price is $330, so the interest paid is:

\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Total Amount Paid} - \text{Cash Price} = 418 - 330 = 88.
\]

The principal for the loan is the cash price minus the down payment:

\[
\text{Principal} = 330 - 40 = 290.
\]

The interest rate can be calculated using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula:

\[
\text{PV} = \text{PMT} \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r},
\]

where:
- \( \text{PV} = 290 \) (the principal),
- \( \text{PMT} = 10.50 \) (the monthly payment),
- \( n = 36 \) (the number of payments),
- \( r \) is the monthly interest rate (to be solved).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( r \), we test the given annual interest rates by converting them to monthly rates and checking which one brings the present value closest to $290. 

### Testing Option C: 18.2% Annual Rate
The monthly interest rate is:

\[
r = \frac{18.2\%}{12} \approx 1.5167\%.
\]

Calculate \( (1 + r)^{-36} \):

\[
(1.015167)^{-36} \approx 0.5827.
\]

Now calculate the present value factor:

\[
\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-36}}{r} = \frac{1 - 0.5827}{0.015167} \approx 27.51.
\]

Finally, calculate the present value:

\[
\text{PV} = 10.50 \times 27.51 \approx 289.
\]

This is very close to the principal amount of $290, indicating that the annual interest rate is approximately **18.2%**.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **C: 18.2%**.
