Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem has two parts, (a) and (b). Let's start with part (a), which asks me to derive the expression (∂E/∂T)_P = C_P - P(∂V/∂T)_P. Hmm, I remember that E is internal energy, and we're dealing with partial derivatives here.

I think this has something to do with the thermodynamic identities. Maybe starting from the first law of thermodynamics? The first law says dE = TdS - PdV. But wait, I'm not sure how that directly helps with (∂E/∂T)_P.

Wait, another approach: maybe using the differential of E. The total differential of E would be dE = (∂E/∂T)_V dT + (∂E/∂V)_T dV. But since the problem is at constant pressure, maybe we should express this in terms of variables at constant pressure.

Alternatively, I remember that for a process at constant pressure, the heat capacity C_P is defined as (∂H/∂T)_P, where H is the enthalpy. But the problem is about E, not H. Oh, right, because H = E + PV, maybe I can relate these somehow.

So let me think about H. The differential of H is dH = dE + PdV + VdP. At constant pressure, dP=0, so dH = dE + PdV. But wait, that's for a constant pressure process. And since H is a state function, maybe I can write this in terms of partial derivatives.

Alternatively, starting from the definition of C_P. I know that C_P is the heat capacity at constant pressure, which is (∂H/∂T)_P. And since H = E + PV, taking the derivative with respect to T at constant P gives:

(∂H/∂T)_P = (∂E/∂T)_P + (∂(PV)/∂T)_P.

But wait, P is constant here, so ∂(PV)/∂T)_P = P ∂V/∂T at constant P. So,

(∂H/∂T)_P = (∂E/∂T)_P + P (∂V/∂T)_P.

But (∂H/∂T)_P is C_P. So the equation becomes:

C_P = (∂E/∂T)_P + P (∂V/∂T)_P.

Wait, but in the problem's part (a), the expression is (∂E/∂T)_P = C_P - P(∂V/∂T)_P. So if I rearrange the equation I just wrote, that would be:

(∂E/∂T)_P = C_P - P (∂V/∂T)_P.

Yes, that makes sense. So that's the derivation for part (a). I think I got that right.

Now, moving on to part (b), which asks me to calculate (C_P - C_V) for Cu at 20°C. They've given me some data: density, mass, alpha (volume expansion coefficient), and beta (compressibility, I think).

Wait, I remember that there's a relation between C_P and C_V involving the thermal expansion coefficient and compressibility. Let me recall that formula. I think it's:

C_P - C_V = TV (α² / β) * something. Alternatively, I remember that for solids, the difference between C_P and C_V is usually small, but in terms of equations, the general relation is C_P - C_V = (α² T)/(β) * V. Or wait, perhaps it's (α² TV)/(β).

Wait, more accurately, the formula is C_P - C_V = (T V α² ) / β. Let me verify that. From thermodynamics, the relation is:

C_P - C_V = (T V α²) / β.

Yes, that's right. So I need to compute this value for copper.

Let me list out the given data:

Density (d) = 8.934 kg/liter. Wait, wait, that's 8934 kg/m³, because 1 liter is 0.001 m³. So 8.934 kg/liter is 8934 kg/m³.

Molar mass (M) of Cu is 29 × 10^-3 kg/mol. So that's 0.029 kg/mol.

Thermal expansion coefficient (α) is 50.1 × 10^-6 K^-1. So α = 50.1e-6 K^-1.

Compressibility (β) is 0.7e-6 atm^-1. Wait, units here might be tricky. Because the units might need to be in terms of Pa or something else, but maybe we can adjust as needed.

Temperature is 20°C, which is 293.15 K.

So first, I need to find the molar volume V_m. Because the formula uses V, which is the molar volume.

Wait, molar volume V_m is (Molar mass) / density. So V_m = M / d.

But wait, M is 0.029 kg/mol, and d is 8934 kg/m³. So in m³/kg units. So V_m = (0.029 kg/mol) / (8934 kg/m³) ) = 0.029 / 8934 m³/mol.

Let me compute that. 0.029 / 8934 = approximately 3.246e-6 m³/mol. Wait, that is 3.246 × 10^-6 m³ per mol.

Wait, 1 m³ is 10^3 liters, so 3.246e-6 m³ is 3.246e-3 liters. Wait, but let me just compute it numerically.

V_m = 0.029 / 8934 = let's calculate:

0.029 ÷ 8934. Let's see, 8934 ≈ 9e3, so 0.029/9e3 ≈ 3.22e-6 m³/mol. That's correct.

Wait, but maybe I should compute it more accurately.

0.029 ÷ 8934 = 0.029 / 8934 = 2.92e-5? Wait, no, let me compute it step by step.

Wait, 8934 × 1e-3 is 8.934 kg/l. So 0.029 kg/mol divided by 8934 kg/m³ = 0.029 / 8934 = 2.246e-6 m³/mol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me compute 0.029 divided by 8934.

Let me write 0.029 as 2.9e-2. So 2.9e-2 / 8.934e3 = (2.9/8.934) * 1e-5 ≈ (0.3246) * 1e-5 = 3.246e-6 m³/mol.

So V_m ≈ 3.246e-6 m³/mol.

Now, α is given as 50.1e-6 K^-1, which is 5.01e-5 K^-1.

Beta is 0.7e-6 atm^-1. Hmm, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Because in the formula C_P - C_V = (T V α²)/β, the units need to match. So let's check the units of each term.

In the formula, T is in Kelvin (K), V in m³, α is per Kelvin (K^-1), beta is per pressure (e.g., per Pa). So let me make sure beta is in the correct units.

Wait, the given beta is 0.7e-6 atm^-1. So 1 atm is about 101325 Pa. So beta in terms of Pa^-1 would be 0.7e-6 / 101325 ≈ 6.91e-12 Pa^-1.

Wait, but let me think. If β is given in atm^-1, and we're using SI units, then perhaps we should convert beta into Pa^-1.

So beta in SI units is 0.7e-6 atm^-1 * (1 atm / 101325 Pa) ) = 0.7e-6 / 101325 Pa^-1 = approx 6.91e-12 Pa^-1.

Wait, but alternatively, maybe the formula can be written using units where pressure is in atm. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, the formula is C_P - C_V = (T V α² ) / β.

But the units must be consistent. Let's see.

In SI units, V is in m³, T in K, α in K^-1, and beta in Pa^-1.

So the numerator would have units (K) * (m³) * (K^-2) ) → (m³ K^-1).

The denominator beta has units Pa^-1.

So overall, the units would be (m³ K^-1) / (Pa^-1) ) → (m³ K^-1) * Pa → since Pa is N/m², which is kg/(m·s²).

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting into too much unit analysis, which might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed with the calculation using the given values, making sure that the units are consistent.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since the given beta is in atm^-1, and if I use the ideal gas law, but wait, copper is a solid, so that might not apply. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to use beta in the same units as used in the formula.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for C_P - C_V is (T V α² ) / β. So each term:

- T is 293.15 K.

- V is molar volume in m³/mol.

- Alpha is in K^-1.

- Beta is in atm^-1, but in the formula, the units might require it to be in Pa^-1, or perhaps not, depending on how the formula is derived.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to convert beta into SI units first.

Beta is given as 0.7e-6 atm^-1. So 1 atm is 101325 Pa. So beta in Pa^-1 is 0.7e-6 / 101325 ≈ 6.91e-12 Pa^-1.

Now, let's compute each part.

Compute T * V_m: 293.15 K * 3.246e-6 m³/mol ≈ 293.15 * 3.246e-6 ≈ let me compute that.

293 * 3e-6 = 879e-6 = 0.000879. But more precisely:

3.246e-6 * 293.15 ≈ 3.246e-6 * 293 = let's compute 3.246 * 293 = ?

3 * 293 = 879, 0.246 * 293 ≈ 72.078. So total 879 +72.078 = 951.078. So 3.246e-6 * 293 ≈ 951.078e-6 → 0.000951078 m³·K/mol.

Then, alpha squared: (50.1e-6 K^-1)^2 = (50.1)^2 * 1e-12 K^-2.

50.1 squared is approx 2511. So 2511e-12 K^-2.

So now, putting it all together:

(T V α²) / β = (0.000951078 m³·K/mol * 2511e-12 K^-2) / (6.91e-12 Pa^-1).

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator.

First, numerator:

0.000951078 m³·K/mol * 2511e-12 K^-2 = (0.000951078 * 2511e-12) m³/(mol·K).

Wait, 0.000951078 is 9.51078e-4. So 9.51078e-4 * 2511e-12 = (9.51078 * 2511) * 1e-16.

Compute 9.51078 * 2511: let's approximate 9.5 * 2500 = 23750, but more accurately:

2511 * 9 = 22599, 2511 * 0.51078 ≈ 2511 * 0.5 = 1255.5, plus 2511 * 0.01078 ≈ 27.08. So total 1255.5 +27.08≈1282.58. So total 22599 +1282.58 ≈23881.58.

So 23881.58e-16 m³/(mol·K).

Now, denominator: 6.91e-12 Pa^-1.

So overall:

(23881.58e-16 m³/(mol·K)) / (6.91e-12 Pa^-1) ) = (23881.58 / 6.91) * (1e-16 / 1e-12) ) * (m³/(mol·K)) * Pa.

Since Pa is kg/(m·s²), m³ * Pa = (m³)(kg/(m·s²)) ) = kg·m²/(s²).

Wait, but perhaps the units will work out to J/(mol·K), which is what C_P - C_V should be, since heat capacity is energy per temperature.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s². So let me see:

(m³)(Pa) = m³ * (kg/(m·s²)) ) = kg·m²/s² = J.

So the units become J/(mol·K), which is correct.

Now, compute (23881.58 / 6.91) * (1e-4) → because 1e-16 /1e-12 = 1e-4.

So 23881.58 / 6.91 ≈ let's compute that.

6.91 * 3450 = let's see. 6.91 * 3000=20730, 6.91 * 450=3109.5 → total 23839.5. Hmm, that's close to 23881.58.

So 6.91 * 3450 ≈23839.5.

The difference is 23881.58 -23839.5=42.08.

So 42.08 /6.91 ≈6.09. So total is 3450 +6.09≈3456.09.

So 3456.09 * 1e-4 = 0.345609 J/(mol·K).

So approximately 0.3456 J/mol·K.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.346, which is very close. So the answer should be option B, 0.346 J mol^-1 K^-1.

Wait, but I should check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any errors.

Wait, let me recalculate some parts.

First, V_m = M/d.

M = 0.029 kg/mol.

d = 8934 kg/m³.

So V_m = 0.029 / 8934 = 2.92e-5? Wait, wait, 0.029 is 2.9e-2, divided by 8934 → 2.9e-2 / 8.934e3 = (2.9/8.934) * 1e-5 → approx 0.3246 * 1e-5 = 3.246e-6 m³/mol. Yes, that's correct.

Then T is 293.15 K.

So T * V_m = 293.15 * 3.246e-6 = let's compute 293 * 3.246e-6.

293 *3.246 = let's compute 300 *3.246=974.8. But subtract 7 *3.246=22.722 → 974.8-22.722=952.078. So 952.078e-6 m³·K = 0.000952078 m³·K.

Next, alpha squared is (50.1e-6)^2 = (50.1)^2 * (1e-6)^2.

50.1^2 = 2511.01, so 2511.01e-12 K^-2.

So TVα² = 0.000952078 *2511.01e-12 → 0.000952078 =9.52078e-4. So 9.52078e-4 *2511.01e-12 = (9.52078 *2511.01) * 1e-16.

Compute 9.52078 *2511.01.

Approx: 9 *2511 =22599, 0.52078*2511≈1306. So total ~22599+1306=238,905? Wait, wait no, that can't be right. Wait, 2511 *0.5 is 1255.5, 0.02078*2511≈52.16. So 1255.5 +52.16=1307.66. So 22599+1307.66=238,906.66? Wait, that can't be right because 9.52078 is 9 +0.52078.

Wait, 9.52078 *2511.01 = let's compute 9 *2511.01= 22599.09, 0.52078 *2511.01≈0.5*2511=1255.5, plus 0.02078*2511≈52.16. So 1255.5+52.16≈1307.66. So total 22599.09 +1307.66=238,906.75. So 238,906.75e-16 m³/(mol·K).

Now, beta in SI is 0.7e-6 atm^-1 → 0.7e-6 /101325 ≈ 6.91e-12 Pa^-1.

So (TVα²)/beta = (238,906.75e-16) / (6.91e-12) ) → 238,906.75 /6.91 ≈ 34,560. So 34,560e-4 (since 1e-16 /1e-12=1e-4). So 34,560 *1e-4 = 3.456 J/(mol·K).

Wait, wait wait, that's conflicting with the earlier result. Oh
