Okay, so I've got this question about which substance releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body. The options are various compounds: glycerol, lactose, fructose, palmitic acid, cellulose, glucose, alcohol, and leucine. Hmm, I remember that different nutrients have different caloric values. I think fats release more energy than carbohydrates and proteins, but I'm not entirely sure about all the details.

Wait, so the question is about per gram, right? Because I recall that fats have a higher energy content per gram compared to carbs. Like, I think fats are around 9 kcal per gram, while carbs are about 4 kcal, and proteins are also around 4. Oh, but wait, doesn't it depend on the specific compound too?

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A: Glycerol. Glycerol is a component of triglycerides, which are fats. But I think pure glycerol might have a different energy yield. Wait, isn't glycerol more like a carbohydrate derivative? Or is it considered as part of fat? Hmm. I might need to look up the caloric content of glycerol. Maybe it's around 4.3 kcal per gram? Or is it higher? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Option B: Lactose. That's a disaccharide, a carbohydrate. So probably around 4 kcal per gram, same as other sugars. But wait, lactose is made of glucose and galactose, so it's similar to other carbs.

Option C: Fructose. Another sugar, a monosaccharide. So again, about 4 kcal per gram.

Option D: Palmitic acid. Oh, that's a saturated fatty acid, right? So as a fat, it should have a higher caloric content. I think fats are around 9 kcal per gram. So this could be the one releasing the most energy.

Option E: Cellulose. Cellulose is a polysaccharide, but it's a fiber. Humans can't digest it because we lack the enzyme to break it down. So when it's oxidized, does that mean it's not actually digested? Wait, the question says "when completely oxidised in the body." So if the body can't break it down, maybe it doesn't release energy. Or maybe in the gut, but I think the body can't use it, so it wouldn't release much energy. So E is probably low.

Option F: Glucose. That's the main energy sugar, right? So about 4 kcal per gram.

Option G: Alcohol. Wait, alcohol is tricky. I think ethanol has about 7 kcal per gram. So higher than carbs but lower than fats. So that's more than glucose but less than palmitic acid.

Option H: Leucine. That's an essential amino acid, so a protein. Proteins are about 4 kcal per gram, similar to carbs. Unless when they're used for energy, but I think that's the standard value.

So putting it all together, the highest energy per gram would be the fatty acid, palmitic acid. Because fats give the most energy. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Glycerol, in option A, I'm not too sure. If pure glycerol is being considered, what's its energy content? I think glycerol is a three-carbon molecule. When it's part of a triglyceride, the fatty acids are the main source. Glycerol itself, when oxidized, I think provides about 4.3 kcal per gram. So that's higher than carbs but lower than fats. So D is still higher.

So the order would be: Palmitic acid (D) > Alcohol (G) > Glycerol (A) > Glucose (F), Lactose (B), Fructose (C), Leucine (H) > Cellulose (E).

So the one that releases the most energy is D: palmitic acid.

To determine which substance releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body, we analyze the energy content per gram of each option:

- **A: Glycerol**  
  Glycerol is a three-carbon molecule derived from fats. It has a caloric content of approximately **4.3 kcal per gram**, which is higher than carbohydrates but lower than fats.

- **B: Lactose**  
  Lactose is a disaccharide carbohydrate, composed of glucose and galactose. Carbohydrates generally provide about **4 kcal per gram**.

- **C: Fructose**  
  Fructose is a monosaccharide carbohydrate. Like other sugars, it releases approximately **4 kcal per gram**.

- **D: Palmitic Acid**  
  Palmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid. Fats have the highest energy content at about **9 kcal per gram**, making this the most energy-dense option.

- **E: Cellulose**  
  Cellulose is a polysaccharide fiber. Humans cannot digest it due to the lack of necessary enzymes, so it releases negligible energy.

- **F: Glucose**  
  Glucose is a monosaccharide carbohydrate and a primary energy source for the body. It provides about **4 kcal per gram**.

- **G: Alcohol**  
  Ethanol (alcohol) has an energy content of approximately **7 kcal per gram**, which is higher than carbohydrates but lower than fats.

- **H: Leucine**  
  Leucine is an essential amino acid, part of proteins. Proteins generally provide about **4 kcal per gram**.

Based on this analysis, **palmitic acid (D)** releases the most energy per gram, as fats have the highest caloric value. The order of energy release is:  
**D (Palmitic Acid) > G (Alcohol) > A (Glycerol) > F (Glucose), B (Lactose), C (Fructose), H (Leucine) > E (Cellulose)**.

Answer: **D**
