Question:

Trace language development during preschool age.

Options:

A: During preschool age, children learn an entirely new language spontaneously without prior exposure.
B: Language development during preschool age involves understanding complex grammatical rules without the ability to apply them in speech.
C: Language development during preschool age is limited to two-word sentences.
D: Preschool children develop the ability to write sentences before they can speak them.
E: Preschool children's language is limited to mimicking sounds without forming coherent words or sentences.
F: During preschool age, children only learn how to perfectly use grammar without developing their vocabulary.
G: During preschool age, children communicate exclusively through non-verbal means and gestures, with no advancement in spoken language.
H: At preschool age, children's vocabulary shrinks before it begins to grow again.
I: Language development regresses during preschool age.
J: During preschool age, the language development of the child progresses beyond the formation of two-word sentences. He begins to form three-word sentences and, from this point on, his language and grammar become more diverse and complex.

Okay, so I've got this question about language development in preschool-age children. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer from the options given. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question is asking about what happens during the preschool age regarding language. I remember that preschoolers are usually between 3 to 5 years old. At this stage, their language skills really start to take off.

Looking at the options:

Option A says they learn a new language spontaneously without prior exposure. That doesn't sound right. I think children need some exposure to a language to learn it, even if they pick it up quickly. Spontaneous without any exposure seems unlikely.

Option B mentions understanding complex grammar but can't apply it. I'm not too sure about this. I think as kids get older, they both understand and start using more complex sentences, not just understand without using them.

Option C limits them to two-word sentences. Wait, I remember that around 2 years old, they start with two-word sentences, but by preschool age (like 3 and up), they can form longer sentences. So this might not be correct because it's too limited.

Option D says they can write sentences before speaking them. That doesn't make sense. Most kids speak before they write. Writing usually comes after they have some spoken language skills.

Option E is about mimicking sounds without coherent words or sentences. That sounds more like infants or maybe toddlers, not preschoolers who are starting to form proper sentences.

Option F claims they learn perfect grammar without developing vocabulary. I don't think that's right. Vocabulary and grammar develop together, and preschoolers are known for expanding both.

Option G says they only use non-verbal communication. No, that's not it. Preschoolers definitely advance in spoken language. They talk a lot and improve their speaking skills.

Option H suggests vocabulary shrinks before growing. I haven't heard that. I think vocabulary steadily increases as they get older, especially in preschool.

Option I says language development regresses. That doesn't sound right either. Unless there's some issue, most kids progress in their language skills during these years.

Option J states that they move beyond two-word sentences, forming three-word sentences and more complex language. That rings a bell. I think around 3 years old, children start combining three words, and their sentences get longer and more complex. Their grammar and vocabulary both expand.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be J. It accurately describes the progression from two-word sentences to more complex ones during the preschool years.

The correct answer is J. During preschool age, children progress beyond two-word sentences, forming three-word sentences and developing more diverse and complex language and grammar.
