Question:

This question refers to the following information.
For a long time, educated Germans answered it in the positive, initially by laying claim to a special German mission, then, after the collapse of 1945, by criticizing Germany's deviation from the West. Today, the negative view is predominant. Germany did not, according to the now prevailing opinion, differ from the great European nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a "unique German path." And, in any case, no country on earth ever took what can be described as the "normal path."

Okay, so I've got this question about a passage from Heinrich August Winkler's book. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. The question is about inferring something from the passage regarding the belief that Germany had a unique mission in history.

First, I'll read the passage again to make sure I get the details right. The passage says that for a long time, educated Germans answered a certain question positively. Initially, they did this by claiming a special German mission. Then, after 1945 (which is after WWII), they started criticizing Germany's deviation from the West. But today, the negative view is predominant. The current opinion is that Germany didn't differ enough from other great European nations to justify the idea of a "unique German path." Also, it's mentioned that no country ever took what could be called a "normal path."

So the question is asking about the belief in a unique German mission. The options are from A to I, and I need to pick the correct inference.

Looking at the passage, it says that educated Germans initially supported the idea of a special mission. But after 1945, they shifted to criticizing Germany's deviation from the West. Now, the prevailing view is negative, meaning they don't think Germany had a unique path anymore.

So the belief in a unique mission was held initially, but after WWII, it was criticized. That suggests that the belief was discredited or rejected after the war. Now, looking at the options:

Option G says the belief was discredited by Germany's defeat in WWII. That makes sense because the passage says after the collapse in 1945, they started criticizing the deviation, implying that the defeat led to the discrediting of the unique mission idea.

Other options: A says other European nations supported it after WWII, but the passage doesn't mention other nations supporting it. B talks about economic recovery, which isn't in the passage. C says it was proven correct by defeat, which is the opposite of what the passage implies. D says the belief resulted from the defeat, but the belief was before the defeat. E says it was the prevailing view after WWII, but the passage says the oppositeâ€”after the war, the view changed to criticism. F says all Germans rejected it, but the passage says the negative view is predominant now, not that all rejected it. H says it was unaffected by defeat, which contradicts the passage. I says it led to victory, which is false because Germany lost.

So the correct answer should be G.
</think>

The passage indicates that the belief in a unique German mission was initially supported but lost credibility after Germany's defeat in WWII, as educated Germans began to criticize the nation's divergence from Western values. This aligns with option G, which states that the belief was discredited by the defeat.

Answer: G
