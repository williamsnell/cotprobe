Question:

A man, his brother and his friend all discuss murdering the man's neighbor because the neighbor took some shots at the man's dog but he missed. They agree on a plan. They decided on strychnine poisoning, which the friend told them how to get and they went and got it. When they asked the friend to go forward in poisoning the victim, he refused, saying, "I'm was only here for planning and advice, but I never intended to commit murder." The man and his brother took the poison to a meeting with the neighbor, but he wouldn't drink. They were caught and arrested. The statute requires an overt act for criminal conspiracy. Which of the following most accurately states the criminal responsibility of each of the three men?

Options:

A: The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.
B: The man, his brother, and the friend are all guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder.
C: The man and his brother have committed criminal conspiracy and attempted murder.
D: The friend is guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, but the man and his brother are not guilty.
E: The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, but the friend is guilty of nothing.
F: The friend is guilty of conspiracy, but not the man and his brother.
G: The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy, while the friend is guilty of attempted murder.
H: The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy but not attempted murder.
I: Only the man is guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, while his brother and the friend are not guilty.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question about criminal conspiracy and attempted murder. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: There's a man, his brother, and a friend. They're all discussing murdering the man's neighbor because the neighbor shot at his dog but missed. They agree on a plan to use strychnine poisoning. The friend tells them how to get it, and they go get the poison. But when asked to actually poison the neighbor, the friend refuses, saying he was only there for planning and advice and never intended to commit murder. Then, the man and his brother take the poison to meet the neighbor, but he refuses to drink, and they get caught.

The legal question is about their criminal responsibility under a statute that requires an overt act for conspiracy.

Hmm, so I remember that conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, and an overt act is usually needed. The overt act doesn't have to be the actual crime, just something that shows they're taking steps towards it.

So, the man, brother, and friend all discussed the plan and agreed to murder the neighbor. The friend even told them how to get strychnine, and they went to get it. So that seems like an overt act—acquiring the poison.

But then the friend backed out, refusing to go through with it. But does that matter? Because once the overt act is done, the conspiracy is formed. So all three of them were part of the conspiracy because they agreed and took that overt step.

But wait, what about the friend's refusal? If he withdrew before the overt act, maybe he wouldn't be guilty, but if the overt act happened while he was still part of the agreement, then he's still on the hook. So in this case, the overt act (getting the poison) happened while all three were in agreement. So all three are conspirators.

But then the man and brother tried to carry out the murder by taking the poison to the neighbor, but the neighbor wouldn't drink. So they were attempting murder. Attempted murder requires specific intent to commit the crime and a substantial step towards it.

So the man and brother took the poison, which is a substantial step, so they're guilty of attempted murder. What about the friend? He didn't take any steps beyond the initial planning and getting the poison, but he withdrew when asked to act. So he didn't attempt the murder himself. So he's part of the conspiracy but not the attempt.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, once you're part of a conspiracy, you're liable for the crimes committed by co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy. But in this case, the friend withdrew before the attempt. So he wouldn't be liable for the attempt. Because attempt requires his own actions and intent.

So putting it together: The man and brother are guilty of both conspiracy (because of the agreement and overt act) and attempted murder (because they took substantial steps). The friend is guilty of conspiracy because he was part of the agreement and the overt act, but he's not guilty of attempted murder because he didn't participate in the attempt and withdrew.

Wait, but the question is about each of their responsibilities. So the friend is guilty of conspiracy but not attempted murder. The man and brother are guilty of both.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the man and brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder. It doesn't mention the friend. So that's not all.

Option E says man and brother guilty of both, and friend guilty of nothing. But I thought the friend is guilty of conspiracy.

Option A says man and brother guilty of both, and friend guilty of conspiracy. That fits. Because the friend is part of the conspiracy but not the attempt.

Wait, but does the friend's withdrawal affect his conspiracy charge? I think once the overt act is done, he's in. Unless he withdrew before the overt act, which he didn't. So the friend is guilty of conspiracy, but not of the attempt.

So the man and brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of conspiracy. Looking at the options, option C says the man and brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder. But it doesn't mention the friend. Oh, wait I should check all options.

Option C: The man and his brother have committed criminal conspiracy and attempted murder.

So option C doesn't address the friend's guilt for conspiracy. But the question asks about each of the three men.

Option A: The man and his brother guilty of both, and the friend guilty of conspiracy. That's possible.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder. So it doesn't say the friend is guilty of anything. But I think the friend is guilty of conspiracy.

Option E: The man and brother guilty of both, friend guilty of nothing. But that's not right because the friend was part of the conspiracy.

Option A: The man and brother guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder; friend guilty of conspiracy. So that's correct.

So the answer should be option C? Wait, no, because option C doesn't mention the friend. The question is about each of the three men—so each's responsibility.

Wait, the options:

Option C says "the man and his brother have committed criminal conspiracy and attempted murder." It doesn't say anything about the friend. So perhaps the friend isn't guilty of anything? But that can't be right because he was part of the conspiracy and the overt act.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. The friend's statement was that he never intended to commit murder. So perhaps he didn't have the intent to conspire? Because conspiracy requires intent to agree to commit the crime.

Wait, the friend said he was only there for planning and advice and didn't intend to commit murder. So maybe he never actually agreed to the conspiracy, meaning he's not guilty of conspiracy. But in the scenario, it says "they agreed on a plan." So the friend was part of the agreement.

Wait, but if the friend didn't intend to go through with it, maybe there was no meeting of the minds. So perhaps he didn't actually agree to the conspiracy. That's a possible angle. So if he didn't have the intent, he's not guilty of conspiracy.

So that changes things. So the man and brother agreed to commit murder, and the friend just gave advice but didn't intend to agree. So no conspiracy as to the friend.

In that case, the man and brother conspired and attempted, and the friend isn't guilty.

Looking back, the initial plan was agreed upon by all three. The friend then refused to go forward, but the overt act (getting the poison) had already happened. So if the friend was part of the initial agreement, he's guilty of conspiracy regardless of later withdrawal.

But if the friend didn't intend to agree from the start, then he's not part of the conspiracy. The key is whether he intended to agree to the crime.

The question says, "they agreed on a plan." So all three were in agreement. So the friend was part of the conspiracy, even if he later tried to back out.

So the friend is guilty of conspiracy, and the man and brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder.

Looking at the options again, option C says the man and brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder. But it doesn't address the friend. So maybe the correct answer is option C, but then the friend isn't being addressed. Oh, wait I should check all options.

Wait, option E says the man and brother are guilty of both, and the friend is guilty of nothing. But that's wrong because the friend was part of the conspiracy.

Option A: man and brother guilty of both, friend guilty of conspiracy. That seems correct.

So the answer is A.

To determine the criminal responsibility of each individual, we must analyze the elements of conspiracy and attempted murder under the given statute, which requires an overt act for conspiracy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Conspiracy**:  
   Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more individuals to commit a crime, along with an overt act in furtherance of that agreement.  
   - The man, his brother, and the friend discussed and agreed on a plan to murder the neighbor using strychnine poisoning.  
   - The overt act occurred when they acquired the strychnine, which was done while all three were still part of the agreement.  
   - Therefore, all three individuals are guilty of conspiracy because they agreed to the plan and took an overt act in furtherance of it.  

2. **Attempted Murder**:  
   Attempted murder requires specific intent to commit the crime and a substantial step toward its commission.  
   - The man and his brother took the poison to the neighbor and attempted to carry out the murder, which constitutes a substantial step. Thus, they are guilty of attempted murder.  
   - The friend, however, withdrew from the plan before the attempt occurred and did not participate in the attempt. Therefore, he is not guilty of attempted murder.  

3. **Friend's Role**:  
   While the friend was part of the conspiracy (as he participated in the agreement and the overt act of acquiring the poison), he is not guilty of attempted murder because he withdrew before the attempt and did not take any further steps toward the crime.  

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Correct. The man and his brother are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted murder, while the friend is guilty of conspiracy.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The friend is not guilty of attempted murder because he withdrew before the attempt.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. It does not address the friend's guilt for conspiracy.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The man and his brother are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted murder.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The friend is guilty of conspiracy, not "nothing."  
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The man and his brother are also guilty of conspiracy.  
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The friend is guilty of conspiracy, not attempted murder.  
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The man and his brother are guilty of attempted murder as well.  
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The brother is guilty of both conspiracy and attempted murder.  
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy as well.  

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option A**, as it accurately reflects the criminal responsibility of each individual based on the elements of conspiracy and attempted murder.  

**Answer: A**
