Okay, so I have this problem here about an automobile dealer selling a used car on an installment plan. I need to find out the monthly payment amount. Let's see what the details are.

The car's case price is $1260. The plan requires no down payment, which is interesting because that means the whole amount is financed. But there's a service charge of 6% per year on the unpaid balance. Also, there's a $20 legal fee. The payments are to be made over 18 months, so I need to calculate each monthly payment.

Hmm, so the first thing I think is that this is an installment loan problem. I remember that the formula for calculating installment payments is similar to the amortization of a loan. The formula is probably something like the present value of an annuity, where you calculate the monthly payment that pays off the principal plus interest over the period.

Wait, but before that, I should figure out the total amount owed, considering the service charge and the legal fee. The service charge is 6% per year on the unpaid balance. Oh wait, but since it's 6% per annum and the payments are monthly, I might need to convert that annual rate into a monthly rate. Because each payment is monthly, the interest each month would be 6% divided by 12, right?

Wait, but no, wait. The service charge is 6% per year, but I'm not sure if it's a simple interest or if it's compounded. The problem says it's charged on the unpaid balance. So perhaps it's similar to interest being charged each period on the remaining balance. So maybe the interest is compounded monthly? Or is it just a flat 6% per year added each year.

Wait, wait. Let's think again. The service charge is 6% per year on the unpaid balance. So if the balance is $1260, the annual interest would be 6% of 1260. But since payments are monthly, perhaps the interest is calculated each month. So the monthly interest rate would be 6% divided by 12, which is 0.5% per month.

Wait, but the problem says the service charge is 6% per year. So maybe that's the annual rate, and they calculate the interest each month based on that. So the monthly interest rate is 0.06/12 = 0.005.

But then there's also a $20 legal fee. So the total amount to be financed isn't just $1260, but $1260 plus $20, right? Because the legal fee is an additional charge. So total principal becomes 1260 + 20 = $1280.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the service charge is calculated on the case price, and then the legal fee is added. Or perhaps the legal fee is part of the total amount. Let me clarify.

The plan requires no down payment, so the total amount the buyer is paying is the case price plus service charge plus legal fees. But how exactly are these charges applied? Let's re-read.

The plan requires no down payment, but a service charge of 6% per year is charged on the unpaid balance. Additionally, a charge of $20 is made for legal fees.

Wait, so the service charge is interest on the unpaid balance, and the legal fee is a flat fee added to the principal.

So the total amount to be financed is the case price plus the legal fee, which is 1260 +20=1280. Then, on top of that, the service charge (interest) is applied. So the total amount owed includes interest over 18 months.

Wait, but the service charge is 6% per year. So for 1.5 years (18 months), the total interest would be 6% * 1.5 = 9% of the principal. But wait, no, because the interest is on the unpaid balance each month, so it's more accurate to model this with the loan payment formula.

I think the correct approach is to calculate the monthly payments using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula. The formula for the monthly payment (PMT) is:

PMT = PV * (r (1 + r)^n) / ((1 + r)^n - 1)

Where:
PV is the present value (loan amount),
r is the monthly interest rate,
n is the number of payments.

In this case, PV is the amount financed, which is 1260 + 20 = 1280 dollars.

The monthly interest rate r is 6% per annum divided by 12, so 0.06/12 = 0.005.

The number of payments n is 18.

So plugging in the numbers:

PMT = 1280 * (0.005*(1+0.005)^18) / ((1+0.005)^18 - 1)

Wait, but wait a second. Is the service charge applied as a simple interest or as an interest that compounds each month? Because the problem says it's a service charge of 6% per year on the unpaid balance. So each month, the interest is calculated on the current unpaid balance. That implies that it's compounding monthly, so yes, the formula applies.

So calculating (1+0.005)^18 first. Let me compute that.

0.005 is the monthly rate. 18 months.

(1.005)^18. Let me compute that step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a financial calculator approach, but since I'm just thinking, I'll try to compute it.

Wait, but I don't have a calculator here. Alternatively, I can approximate it, but perhaps it's better to think of the precise calculation.

Wait, but maybe I can compute (1.005)^18.

Let me think: 1.005^12 is about 1.061678 (since 0.5% per month for a year gives 6.1678% effective annual rate). But 18 months is a year and a half. So perhaps 1.005^18 = (1.005^12)*(1.005^6).

We know 1.005^12 is approximately 1.061678.

What about 1.005^6? Let's compute:

1.005^1 = 1.005

^2 = 1.010025

^3 ≈ 1.015075

^4 ≈ 1.020150

^5 ≈ 1.025250

^6 ≈ 1.030338

So 1.005^6 ≈ 1.030338.

So 1.005^18 ≈ 1.061678 * 1.030338 ≈ Let's calculate that.

1.061678 * 1.030338. Let me see:

1.061678 * 1 = 1.061678

1.061678 * 0.03 = 0.031850

1.061678 * 0.000338≈ ~0.000359.

Adding them up: approx 1.061678 + 0.031850 = 1.093528 + 0.000359 ≈ 1.093887.

So (1.005)^18 ≈ 1.093887.

Now, the numerator is 0.005 * 1.093887 = 0.005468935.

The denominator is 1.093887 - 1 = 0.093887.

So the fraction is 0.005468935 / 0.093887 ≈ Let me compute that.

0.005468935 divided by 0.093887.

Let me compute 0.005469 / 0.093887.

So approximately, 0.005469 / 0.093887 ≈ 0.05824.

So the factor is approximately 0.05824.

Now, the PMT is 1280 * 0.05824 ≈ ?

1280 * 0.05 = 64.

1280 * 0.00824 = let's compute 1280 *0.008=10.24, and 1280 *0.00024=0.3072. So total 10.24 + 0.3072=10.5472.

So 64 +10.5472=74.5472.

So approx $74.55 per month.

Wait, but let me make sure. Are there any other charges? The $20 legal fee is included in the PV, which I added as 1280. So that part is correct.

Looking at the options, option E is $74.44, which is very close to my approximation of $74.55. That's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but perhaps my approximation of (1.005)^18 is a bit off. Let me try a more accurate approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula without approximating.

Wait, perhaps I can use the present value of annuity formula more accurately.

So the exact PMT is 1280 * [ (r(1+r)^n) / ((1+r)^n -1) ].

r=0.005, n=18.

Let me compute (1.005)^18 more accurately.

Another approach: Using the formula for (1 + r)^n.

Each month, multiply by 1.005.

1.005^1 = 1.005

^2=1.010025

^3≈1.0150751

^4≈1.0201505

^5≈1.0252503

^6≈1.0303382

^7≈1.0354343

^8≈1.0406725

^9≈1.0460655

^10≈1.0515171

^11≈1.0571294

^12≈1.0627985

^13≈1.0686223

^14≈1.0746053

^15≈1.0807518

^16≈1.0870653

^17≈1.0934501

^18≈1.10000 approximately? Wait, let me do it step by step.

Wait, let's compute each step.

1.005^1 = 1.005

2: 1.005 * 1.005 = 1.010025

3: 1.010025 *1.005 = 1.015075125

4: 1.015075125 *1.005 ≈ 1.020150500

5: 1.0201505 *1.005 = 1.025250250

6: 1.02525025 *1.005 ≈ 1.0303382025

7: 1.0303382 *1.005 ≈ 1.0354343

8: 1.0354343 *1.005 ≈ 1.0406723

9: 1.0406723 *1.005 ≈ 1.0460653

10: 1.0460653 *1.005 ≈ 1.051517

11: 1.051517 *1.005 ≈ 1.057129

12: 1.057129 *1.005 ≈ 1.062798

13: 1.062798 *1.005 ≈ 1.068622

14: 1.068622 *1.005 ≈ 1.074605

15: 1.074605 *1.005 ≈ 1.080751

16: 1.080751 *1.005 ≈ 1.087065

17: 1.087065 *1.005 ≈ 1.093450

18: 1.093450 *1.005 ≈ 1.098859

So (1.005)^18 ≈ 1.098859.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 1.093887, but now calculating step by step, it's 1.098859.

So the numerator is 0.005 * 1.098859 ≈ 0.005494295.

Denominator is 1.098859 -1 = 0.098859.

So the factor is 0.005494295 / 0.098859 ≈ let me compute that.

Dividing 0.005494 by 0.098859.

Approximate:

0.098859 is about 0.09886.

0.005494 / 0.09886 ≈ 0.0555.

So the factor is approximately 0.0555.

Then, PMT = 1280 * 0.0555 ≈ 1280 *0.05 is 64, 1280 *0.0055 is 7.04. So total approximately 71.04?

Wait, wait, that's conflicting with earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier. Let me go through it again.

Wait, when I calculated (1.005)^18 step by step, I got approximately 1.098859.

So the numerator is 0.005 * 1.098859 = 0.005494.

Denominator is 1.098859 -1 = 0.098859.

So 0.005494 / 0.098859 ≈ let's compute that more accurately.

0.005494 ÷ 0.098859.

Let me compute 5494 ÷ 98859, but that's cumbersome.

Alternatively, approximate:

0.098859 is approximately 0.09886.

So 0.005494 / 0.09886 ≈ (0.005494 *100000)/(0.09886 *100000) )= 5494 /9886.

Compute 5494 ÷ 9886.

Well, 9886 is about 10,000. 5494 is about half of that, so approx 0.555.

So 0.5555.

So PMT= 1280 * 0.5555 ≈ ?

Wait, 1280 *0.5 is 640.

1280 *0.05=64.

1280 *0.0055=7.04.

So 640 +64=704 +7.04=711.04. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.5555 is 55.55% of 1280.

Wait, no, wait, no. 0.5555 is the factor, so PMT=1280 *0.0555.

Wait, no, wait the factor is 0.0555, which is 5.55% of 1280.

Wait, that can't be. Because 0.5555 *1280 is 711, which is way too high for a monthly payment on a $1280 loan over 18 months.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the factor is 0.0555. Let me do the division again.

0.005494 divided by 0.098859.

Let me compute 0.005494 / 0.098859.

I can write it as 5.494 x10^-3 divided by 9.8859 x10^-2.

Which is (5.494/9.8859) x 10^(-3 - (-2)) = (5.494/9.8859) x 10^(-1) ) = approximately (0.5555) x 0.1 = 0.05555.

So yes, the factor is approx 0.05555.

So PMT=1280 *0.05555 ≈ 1280 *0.055 =70.40, and 1280 *0.00055= 0.704. So total 71.104.

Wait, that's about $71.10 per month.

But earlier, using a different approximation, I got around $74.55. Now I'm getting around $71.10. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating (1.005)^18. Let me check that again.

Wait, when I calculated step by step, (1.005)^18 came out to be approximately 1.098859. Let me verify that.

Let me compute (1.005)^12 first.

(1.005)^12: let's compute each step.

1.005^1=1.005

2: 1.010025

3: 1.015075125

4: 1.020150500

5: 1.025250375

6: 1.030338202

7: 1.03543434

8: 1.04067245

9: 1.04606531

10:1.05151707

11:1.05712935

12:1.06279892

So (1.005)^12 ≈1.06279892.

Now, (1.005)^18 is (1.005)^12 * (1.005)^6.

We have (1.005)^6 as approximately 1.0303382.

So 1.06279892 *1.0303382.

Let me compute that:

1.06279892 *1.0303382.

Multiply 1.0628 *1.0303.

Calculate 1 * 1.0303 =1.0303.

0.0628 *1.0303 ≈ 0.0628*1=0.0628, 0.0628*0.0303≈0.001902.

So total ≈0.0628 +0.001902=0.064702.

So total is 1.0303 + 0.064702 =1.094992.

So approximately 1.094992, which is about 1.0950.

So (1.005)^18 ≈1.0950.

So earlier, when I did it step by step, I got 1.098859, but perhaps I made a mistake in that step-by-step. Because 1.005^18 is closer to 1.095.

So perhaps I should use 1.095 as (1.005)^18.

So the numerator becomes 0.005 *1.095 =0.005475.

Denominator is 1.095-1=0.095.

So the factor is 0.005475 / 0.095.

Compute that: 0.005475 ÷ 0.095 = 0.057633.

So PMT=1280 *0.057633≈?

1280 *0.05=64.

1280 *0.007633= approx 9.77.

So total ≈64 +9.77=73.77.

So approx $73.77 per month.

Looking at the options, E is $74.44, which is close. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation gives a precise value.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Let me compute (1.005)^18 exactly.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

(1.005)^18.

I can compute it as e^(18*ln(1.005)).

ln(1.005) ≈0.00497512.

So 18 *0.00497512≈0.0895832.

e^0.0895832≈1.0938.

So (1.005)^18≈1.0938.

So numerator is 0.005 *1
