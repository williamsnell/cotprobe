Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question about methods that reduce prejudice. The question gives me ten options, from A to J. I remember that this is a psychology question, probably related to social psychology because it's about prejudice and how to reduce it.

I think about what I've learned before. There's a concept called the contact hypothesis, which suggests that bringing people from different groups together can reduce prejudice, but it has to be under the right conditions. So I think that's about equal-status contact. Like, if people from different groups meet in a setting where they have equal status, they're more likely to interact positively and reduce their biases.

Another thing I remember is that providing information contrary to a person's beliefs can help change their attitudes. So, maybe education campaigns or information that challenges stereotypes would be helpful. 

There's also something about interdependence. I think when groups are interdependent, meaning they need each other to achieve a common goal, it fosters cooperation and reduces conflict. So that might be part of the solution as well.

Looking at the options, option C says "Providing information contrary to beliefs, equal-status contact, and interdependence." That seems to fit with what I was thinking. Let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A is about quotas. I'm not sure about that. Quotas might create resentment and could backfire, so I don't think that's generally viewed as helpful.

Option B suggests subliminal messaging. I don't think that's effective because people might not even be aware of it, and changing deep-seated beliefs without conscious processing is unlikely.

Option D promotes segregation, which would probably increase prejudice because it prevents contact between groups.

Option E is about avoiding discussions of differences. That doesn't seem right because ignoring differences can prevent real understanding and might just hide the problem instead of solving it.

Option F is direct confrontation. I think that might make people defensive and less likely to change their beliefs, so maybe that's not the best approach.

Option G is strict penalties. While laws against discrimination are important, just punishing people might not change their underlying beliefs. They might comply out of fear but still hold prejudiced views.

Option H is public campaigns. That could be part of it, but I'm not sure if it's the most effective method on its own. Education is good, but maybe not sufficient alone.

Option I is mandatory diversity training. I'm not certain about this. Some studies show mixed results; sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't, depending on how it's implemented.

Option J is forced desegregation and busing. While desegregation can lead to more contact, if it's forced without the right conditions, like mutual respect and equal status, it might not reduce prejudice and could cause resistance.

So putting it all together, option C seems to cover the main points I remember from social psychology about reducing prejudice: education, equal contact, and interdependence.

The methods generally viewed as helpful in reducing prejudice include providing information that challenges existing beliefs, facilitating equal-status contact between groups, and fostering interdependence to promote cooperation. These approaches align with principles from social psychology, such as the contact hypothesis and the importance of education in changing attitudes. Other options, like quotas, segregation, or direct confrontation, may not be as effective or could even exacerbate prejudice. Therefore, the best answer is:

C: Providing information contrary to beliefs, equal-status contact, and interdependence.
