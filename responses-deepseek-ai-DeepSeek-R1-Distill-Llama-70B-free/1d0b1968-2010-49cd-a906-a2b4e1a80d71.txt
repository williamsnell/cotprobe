Okay, so I've got this EPR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the X-band EPR spectrum of a matrix-isolated Na atom. The spectrum shows four hyperfine lines with resonant fields at 3074 G, 3174 G, 3274 G, and 3374 G. I need to calculate the g value of the atom.

Hmm, right. EPR, or electron paramagnetic resonance, measures the magnetic properties of unpaired electrons. The g value is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the magnetic moment of the electron in a crystal field. For a free electron, the g value is approximately 2.0023, but in different environments, it can shift a bit.

So, the first thing I need to remember is the basic EPR equation. I think it's something like the resonance condition when the microwave frequency matches the energy difference between magnetic states. The formula I recall is:

hν = gβB + hyperfine terms...

Wait, more accurately, the resonance condition is given by:

hν = gμ_B B + ... (other terms like hyperfine interaction)

But in this case, since we're dealing with hyperfine lines, I might need to consider the hyperfine splitting as well. Wait, but the question is about finding the g value. So maybe I can average the fields to find the central value, which would relate to the g factor.

Wait, in EPR, the resonance field B is related to the g value by the equation:

B = (hν)/(gμ_B)

But wait, that's the case when there's no hyperfine splitting, right? Or when the hyperfine interaction is considered as a splitting around the central field. Hmm. Alternatively, in the presence of hyperfine structure, the lines are split around a central value determined by g.

So for each hyperfine line, the field can be expressed as B = B0 ± (some hyperfine term). But for the purpose of finding g, perhaps we can average all the fields to find B0, the central field, and then use that to compute g.

Let me think. The four lines are equally spaced, each 100 G apart (3074, 3174, 3274, 3374). So 3074, then 100 added each time. So the average would be the middle of the lowest and highest. Let's calculate that.

The lowest is 3074, the highest is 3374. The average would be (3074 + 3374)/2. Let me compute that: 3074 + 3374 is 6448. Divided by 2, that's 3224 G. So the central field B0 is 3224 G.

Wait, but wait. Since there are four lines, maybe the central line is the third one, 3274? Or is it the average of the first and last? Hmm. Let me think again. If there are four lines, they are symmetrically placed around B0. So for four lines, the spacing could be as  B0 - 1.5Δ, B0 - 0.5Δ, B0 + 0.5Δ, B0 + 1.5Δ, or something like that. Wait, but in this case, the spacing between each line is 100 G. So between 3074 and 3174 is 100; same for the others.

Wait, how about the positions: 3074, 3174, 3274, 3374. So the spacing is 100 G between each line. So the four lines are symmetrically placed around the mean. So the mean would be between 3274 and 3174? No, wait, 3074, 3174, 3274, 3374. Let's arrange them in order: 3074 (1st), 3174 (2nd), 3274 (3rd), 3374 (4th). The average of the first and fourth is (3074 +3374)/2 = 3224 G. Similarly, the average of the second and third is (3174 +3274)/2 = 3224 G. So that makes sense. So B0 is 3224 G.

So, using that central field B0, I can plug into the EPR formula to find g.

The EPR condition is when the microwave photon's energy equals the energy difference between spin states. So:

hν = gμ_B B0

Solving for g:

g = (hν)/(μ_B B0)

Now, I need to plug in the numbers. The frequency ν is given as 9.5 GHz. But wait, in formulas, I should make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, let's get the constants right.

Planck's constant h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

The Bohr magneton μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e) ≈ 9.2740100783e-24 J/T.

But wait, when dealing with frequencies in GHz and magnetic fields in Gauss, perhaps there's a more convenient formula. Because 1 Tesla = 10^4 Gauss, and 1 GHz is 1e9 Hz.

Alternatively, I remember that for the free electron, g = ge ≈ 2.0023. So the formula can be rewritten in terms of ge.

Wait, another approach is to use the formula:

g = (ν * h)/(β * B)

Where β is the Bohr magneton, but I have to get the units right.

Alternatively, there's a commonly used shortcut formula when ν is in GHz and B in Gauss:

g = (ν (GHz) * 2.8025) / B (Gauss)

Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The relation is hν = gμ_B B.

So solving for g:

g = (h ν) / (μ_B B)

Let me compute the units:

h is in J·s, ν in Hz, μ_B in J/T, B in Tesla.

So J·s * Hz = J (since Hz = 1/s). J/(J/T * T) )= unitless. So the units are correct.

Let me plug in the constants. Let me compute h ν divided by (μ_B B).

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

ν = 9.5 GHz = 9.5e9 Hz

μ_B = 9.274e-24 J/T

B = 3224 G = 3224 / 10^4 T = 0.3224 T.

So putting it all together:

g = (6.626e-34 * 9.5e9) / (9.274e-24 * 0.3224)

Let me compute numerator and denominator step by step.

Numerator: 6.626e-34 * 9.5e9 = 6.626 *9.5 * 1e-34+9 = (62.935) * 1e-25 = 6.2935e-24.

Denominator: 9.274e-24 * 0.3224 = let's compute 9.274 * 0.3224 first.

9.274 * 0.3 is 2.7822, 9.274 * 0.0224 is approx 0.2076. So total is approx 2.7822 + 0.2076 = 2.9898. But let me compute more accurately.

0.3224 = 0.3 + 0.02 + 0.0024.

9.274 * 0.3 = 2.7822

9.274 * 0.02 = 0.18548

9.274 * 0.0024 = 0.0222576

Adding them: 2.7822 + 0.18548 = 2.96768 + 0.0222576 = 2.9899376.

So denominator is 2.9899376e-24.

So now, g = (6.2935e-24) / (2.9899376e-24) ) = 6.2935 / 2.9899376.

Let me compute this division.

6.2935 ÷ 2.9899 ≈ let's see.

Approximate, 2.99 * 2 = 5.98, 5.98 is less than 6.29. So 2.99 * 2.1 = 6.279. Close to 6.2935.

So 2.99 * 2.1 = 6.279. The difference is 6.2935 -6.279=0.0145.

So 0.0145 / 2.99 ≈ 0.00485.

So total is 2.1 + 0.00485 ≈ 2.10485.

So approximately 2.105.

Wait, but wait. Let's compute more accurately.

Compute 6.2935 / 2.9899376.

Let me write this as:

6.2935 ÷ 2.9899376.

Let me compute it step by step.

2.9899376 × 2 = 5.9798752

Subtract this from 6.2935: 6.2935 -5.9798752 = 0.3136248.

Now, bring down a decimal (well, since we're in decimals, it's already there).

So how many times does 2.9899376 go into 0.3136248?

0.3136248 / 2.9899376 ≈ 0.10495.

So total is 2.0 + 0.10495 = 2.10495.

Approximately 2.105.

Hmm, looking at the options, the options are:

A: 2.005

B:1.950

C:2.200

D:2.250

E:1.990

F:2.002

G:2.100

H:2.020

I:2.010

So the closest to 2.105 is option G: 2.100.

So the g value is approximately 2.100.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make any mistake in the calculation?

Let me recheck the steps.

First, the central field B0 is 3224 G, correct.

Then, converting B to Tesla: 3224 G = 0.3224 T.

h=6.626e-34 J·s

ν=9.5e9 Hz

μ_B=9.274e-24 J/T

So numerator is h*ν = 6.626e-34 *9.5e9 = 6.2935e-24 J.

Denominator is μ_B * B =9.274e-24 *0.3224 = 2.9899e-24 J.

So g=6.2935e-24 /2.9899e-24 = approx 2.105.

So 2.105, which is closest to option G: 2.100.

But wait, let me think again. Could there be another consideration, like the hyperfine interaction affecting the g value? Hmm, but the hyperfine splitting is a separate effect. The g factor is determined by the central field, so including the hyperfine structure, the central line is at 3224 G, so I think the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that in EPR, the g value is calculated using:

g = (ν * h) / (β * B)

But sometimes, the formula is expressed with ν in GHz, B in Gauss, and using a constant factor. Let me see if I can find that.

Wait, let me think differently. Sometimes, in EPR, people use the formula:

g = (ν (GHz) * 2.835) / B (kG)

Wait, because 1 kG = 10^3 Gauss, but maybe that's not quite right. Alternatively, the formula might involve 2.802 or similar.

Wait, another approach: the free electron g-factor ge is approximately 2.0023, and the relation between g, frequency ν, and magnetic field B is given by:

ge = (h ν)/(μ_B B)

So rearranged, B = (h ν) / (μ_B ge)

But perhaps there's a shortcut when using certain units.

Given that h = 6.626e-34 J·s, μ_B =9.274e-24 J/T, let's compute (h)/(μ_B): 

6.626e-34 / 9.274e-24 = (6.626/9.274) * 1e-10

6.626/9.274 ≈ 0.7145.

So 0.7145e-10 J·s/(J/T) )= 0.7145e-10 T·s.

Wait, but T is kg/(s²·A), but perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, let's compute h/(μ_B) in terms of (Ghz·Tesla)^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute h ν / (μ_B) in Tesla·GHz^{-1}.

Wait, let me see:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

ν in GHz is 9.5e9 Hz.

So h ν = 6.626e-34 * 9.5e9 = 6.2935e-24 J.

μ_B =9.274e-24 J/T.

So h ν / μ_B = (6.2935e-24) / (9.274e-24) ) T^{-1}.

Which is approximately 0.6785 T^{-1}.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again.

Wait, h ν has units of J (because Hz is 1/s, so J·s * 1/s = J).

μ_B has units of J/T.

So h ν / μ_B has units of (J) / (J/T) )= T.

So, (h ν) / (μ_B) )= 6.2935e-24 J / 9.274e-24 J/T = (6.2935/9.274) T ≈ 0.6785 T.

So, h ν / (μ_B) )= ~0.6785 T.

Then, g = (h ν)/(μ_B B) )= (0.6785 T) / B.

Wait, but B is in Tesla, so g is unitless.

So, plug in B in Tesla.

In our case, B is 0.3224 T.

So g = 0.6785 / 0.3224 ≈ 2.105.

Which is the same result as before.

So, the g value is approximately 2.105.

Looking at the options, the closest is G: 2.100.

So the correct answer should be G.
</think>

To calculate the g value of the Na atom from the given X-band (9.5 GHz) EPR spectrum, we start by analyzing the resonant field positions: 3074 G, 3174 G, 3274 G, and 3374 G. These four lines are equally spaced, with a separation of 100 G. The central field, \( B_0 \), is the average of the lowest and highest fields:

\[
B_0 = \frac{3074 + 3374}{2} = 3224 \, \text{G}.
\]

Next, we use the EPR resonance condition:

\[
h\nu = g\mu_B B,
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( \nu \) is the microwave frequency, \( \mu_B \) is the Bohr magneton, and \( B \) is the magnetic field. Rearranging for \( g \):

\[
g = \frac{h\nu}{\mu_B B}.
\]

Substituting the constants:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \),
- \( \nu = 9.5 \, \text{GHz} = 9.5 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz} \),
- \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \),
- \( B = 3224 \, \text{G} = 0.3224 \, \text{T} \),

we calculate the numerator:

\[
h\nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (9.5 \times 10^9) = 6.2935 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

The denominator is:

\[
\mu_B B = (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \times 0.3224 = 2.9899 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus:

\[
g = \frac{6.2935 \times 10^{-24}}{2.9899 \times 10^{-24}} \approx 2.105.
\]

Comparing this result to the provided options, the closest value is \( g = 2.100 \), which corresponds to option G.
