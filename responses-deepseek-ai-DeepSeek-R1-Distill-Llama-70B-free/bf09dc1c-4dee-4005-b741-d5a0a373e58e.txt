Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about mystics and their beliefs. The question is asking which mystic believed that evil was a distortion that reveals divine love more clearly. The options are from A to J, each corresponding to a different mystic.

First, I'll try to remember what I know about each of these figures. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Thomas Aquinas. I know he was a Dominican friar and a scholastic theologian. He's famous for his synthesis of Aristotelian philosophy with Christian theology. But I'm not sure if he specifically wrote about evil as a distortion revealing divine love. His works focus more on the nature of God, the universe, and morality, but I don't recall this particular idea being central to his teachings.

Option B: Catherine of Siena. She was a mystic and a saint, known for her visions and her role in the Catholic Church, including being a Doctor of the Church. She wrote about divine love and the soul's journey towards God. I think she might have discussed suffering and evil in the context of God's love, but I'm not certain if she framed evil as a distortion that highlights divine love.

Option C: Teresa of Avila. Another prominent mystic, known for her interior castle and the process of spiritual growth through prayer. She focused on the inner life and the soul's progress towards union with God. I don't specifically remember her addressing evil in the way the question describes, though she did talk about trials and tribulations as part of the spiritual journey.

Option D: Hildegard of Bingen. She was a polymathâ€”abbess, writer, composer. Her mystical works include visions and theological writings. She might have discussed evil, but I'm not sure about this specific concept. Her focus was more on the harmony of creation and the role of the church.

Option E: John of the Cross. He's known for his dark night of the soul, which deals with spiritual struggles and the purification of the soul. He writes about suffering and trials as part of the spiritual path, but again, I'm not sure if he specifically talks about evil as a distortion that reveals divine love.

Option F: Julian of Norwich. She's famous for her work "Revelations of Divine Love," where she describes her visions of Christ. In her writings, she does address the problem of evil. I remember reading that she believed that evil exists but that God's love is greater, and that through evil, God's love is shown more clearly. She might have said something like "all shall be well," suggesting that even in the presence of evil, divine love prevails. This seems to align with the question.

Option G: Bernard of Clairvaux. He was a Cistercian abbot and a major figure in the development of monasticism. His writings focus on love and the mystical life, but I don't think he's associated with the specific idea of evil as a distortion highlighting divine love.

Option H: Ignatius of Loyola. Founder of the Jesuits, known for the Spiritual Exercises. His focus was on discernment and finding God in all things. I don't recall him specifically addressing evil in the way the question describes.

Option I: Francis of Assisi. He's known for his emphasis on poverty, simplicity, and love for creation. While he taught about living a virtuous life and loving God, I don't think he specifically framed evil as a distortion that reveals divine love.

Option J: Meister Eckhart. A Dominican mystic known for his teachings on the unity of the soul with God. He spoke about the spark of the soul and the birth of God within. However, his ideas were more about the oneness with God rather than evil as a distortion showing divine love.

Putting this all together, the one who stands out is Julian of Norwich. She believed that despite the existence of evil, God's love is ultimately victorious and that evil serves to reveal that love more clearly. Her belief that "all shall be well" reflects this idea, as she saw that even through suffering and evil, divine love is made more evident.
