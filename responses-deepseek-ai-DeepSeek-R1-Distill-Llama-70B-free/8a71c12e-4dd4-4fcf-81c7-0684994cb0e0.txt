Okay, so I have this question about inventory turnover for Baxter Co. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Hmm, what's inventory turnover? From what I remember, it's a ratio that shows how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory in a given period. It's a measure of how efficiently the company is managing its inventory. High turnover usually means they're selling stock quickly, which is good, whereas low turnover might indicate poor sales or overstocking.

The formula for inventory turnover, if I'm not mistaken, is Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) divided by the average inventory. Oh wait, right, because you take the average of the beginning and ending inventory to get a sense of the average stock levels throughout the year.

So the data given is: beginning inventory is $200,000, ending inventory is $300,000, and COGS is $500,000. Let me jot that down.

First, calculate the average inventory. That's (beginning + ending) divided by 2. So that's (200,000 + 300,000)/2. Let me compute that. 200k plus 300k is 500k, divided by 2 is 250,000. So average inventory is $250,000.

Next, inventory turnover is COGS divided by average inventory. COGS is $500,000. So 500,000 divided by 250,000. Let me do that division: 500k / 250k equals 2. So the turnover is 2.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Oh right, sometimes people might think to use just ending inventory, but no, the correct approach is to average the beginning and ending to avoid distortions if the inventory levels changed a lot during the year.

So plugging in the numbers: COGS is 500,000. Average inventory is 250,000. 500k / 250k = 2. That's the turnover.

Looking back at the options: option I is 2. So the answer should be I.

The inventory turnover ratio is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\text{Average Inventory}}
\]

Given the data for Baxter Co:
- Beginning Inventory = \$200,000
- Ending Inventory = \$300,000
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = \$500,000

First, calculate the average inventory:

\[
\text{Average Inventory} = \frac{\text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Ending Inventory}}{2} = \frac{200,000 + 300,000}{2} = 250,000
\]

Next, compute the inventory turnover:

\[
\text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\text{COGS}}{\text{Average Inventory}} = \frac{500,000}{250,000} = 2
\]

Thus, Baxter Co's inventory turnover for the year is 2. The correct answer is:

**I**
