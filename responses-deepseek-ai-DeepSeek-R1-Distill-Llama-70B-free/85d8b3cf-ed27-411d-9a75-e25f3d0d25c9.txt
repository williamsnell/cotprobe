Okay, so I have this physics problem here about fluid dynamics. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that incompressible oil is being pumped through a cylindrical pipe. The flow rate is given as 9.5 liters per second, and the second section of the pipe has a diameter of 4.0 cm. They're asking for the flow speed in that section in meters per second.

Wait, I remember that for incompressible fluids, the flow rate (which is the volume per unit time) should remain the same throughout the pipe, right? Because the fluid isn't compressing, so the amount flowing in one section equals another. So I think I can use the equation of continuity here.

The continuity equation is A1*v1 = A2*v2, where A is the cross-sectional area and v is the flow speed. But wait, in this case, maybe only one section is given. Oh, wait no, perhaps the flow rate given is the volume per second, which is the same as the area times velocity.

Wait, flow rate Q is volume per time. So Q = A * v. So if I can find the area of the second section, I can find the velocity.

The diameter given is 4.0 cm, which is 0.04 meters. So the radius is half of that, which is 0.02 meters. The area A is πr². Let me calculate that.

So A = π * (0.02 m)^2. Let me compute that. 0.02 squared is 0.0004 m². Multiply by π, so approximately 0.00125664 m².

Wait, but the flow rate Q is given as 9.5 liters per second. Oh wait, I need to convert that to cubic meters per second because the area is in m². 

Because 1 liter is 0.001 cubic meters. So 9.5 liters is 9.5 * 0.001 = 0.0095 m³/s.

So now, using Q = A * v, I can solve for v. v = Q / A.

Plugging in the numbers: v = 0.0095 m³/s divided by 0.00125664 m².

Let me compute that. Let's see, 0.0095 / 0.00125664. Hmm, let's see.

Wait, maybe I can write it as 9.5e-3 / (π*(0.02)^2). Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute numerically.

Wait, 0.0095 divided by 0.00125664. Let me compute this division.

0.0095 ÷ 0.00125664 = ?

Let me think, 0.00125664 is approximately 1.25664e-3. So 9.5e-3 / 1.25664e-3 = (9.5 / 1.25664).

Compute 9.5 divided by approximately 1.25664.

Let me approximate. 1.25664 is roughly 1.26. 9.5 ÷ 1.26 is around 7.54? Wait, let me check with a calculator approach.

Wait, 1.25664 * 7.5 = 1.25664 *7=8.79648, plus 1.25664 * 0.5=0.62832. So 8.79648 + 0.62832=9.4248. Oh, but 9.5 is a bit higher than 9.4248.

So 1.25664 * 7.5 = 9.4248. The difference between 9.5 and 9.4248 is 0.0752.

So how much more do I need? 0.0752 / 1.25664 ≈ 0.0598. So approximately 7.5 + 0.0598 ≈ 7.5598 m/s.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation because I might have made a mistake in the area.

Wait, the diameter is 4 cm, so radius is 2 cm, which is 0.02 meters. Area is πr². So 3.1416 * (0.02)^2.

(0.02)^2 = 0.0004. Multiply by π: 0.0004 *3.1416 ≈ 0.00125664 m². That part seems correct.

Flow rate Q is 9.5 L/s = 0.0095 m³/s.

So v = Q/A = 0.0095 / 0.00125664 ≈ let's compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 0.0095 ÷ 0.00125664. Let me write this as 9.5e-3 / 1.25664e-3 = (9.5 / 1.25664).

So 9.5 / 1.25664.

Let me compute 1.25664 * 7.6 = let's see. 1.25664 *7 = 8.79648. 1.25664 *0.6 = 0.753984. So 8.79648 + 0.753984 = 9.550464.

Wait, that's more than 9.5. So 7.6 would give me Q = 9.550464, which is a bit higher than 9.5.

Wait, but I'm looking for 9.5, so 7.6 gives me 9.55, which is higher. So I need a value a little less than 7.6.

Wait, let me try 7.55. 1.25664 *7.55 = ?

Compute 1.25664 *7 = 8.79648.

1.25664 *0.55 = let's see, 1.25664 *0.5 = 0.62832, and 1.25664 *0.05=0.062832. So 0.62832 + 0.062832 = 0.691152.

So 8.79648 + 0.691152 = 9.487632, which is very close to 9.5.

So 7.55 gives me 9.4876, which is just a bit less than 9.5. So the velocity would be approximately 7.55 m/s.

Looking at the options, option I is 7.6, which is higher. Option E is 6.8, etc.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier because sometimes factors like unit conversion might have tripped me. Let me check.

Wait, 9.5 liters is 0.0095 m³. Correct.

Diameter is 4 cm, so radius 2 cm. Correct.

Area is π*(0.02)^2 = 0.00125664 m². Correct.

So v = 0.0095 / 0.00125664 ≈ 7.55 m/s.

Looking at the options, option I is 7.6, which is the closest to 7.55. So the answer should be I:7.6 m/s.

Wait, but let me check my calculation again for any possible mistake. Let me compute 0.0095 divided by 0.00125664.

0.0095 ÷ 0.00125664 = ?

I can compute this as 9500 ÷ 1256.64. Let me see:

9500 ÷ 1256.64 ≈ Let me compute how many times 1256.64 fits into 9500.

1256.64 *7 = 8796.48

Subtracting from 9500: 9500 - 8796.48 = 703.52

Now, 703.52 / 1256.64 ≈ 0.56

So total is 7.56, which is approximately 7.56 m/s. So 7.56 is close to 7.6, which is option I.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again. The options are:

A:9.8, B:8.5, C:8.0, D:9.2, E:6.8, F:7.0, G:10.1, H:5.3, I:7.6, J:6.4.

Yes, I is 7.6, which is the closest to our calculated 7.56. So the correct answer should be I.

To determine the flow speed of the oil in the second section of the pipe, we use the equation for flow rate:

\[
Q = A \cdot v
\]

where \( Q \) is the flow rate, \( A \) is the cross-sectional area of the pipe, and \( v \) is the flow speed. The flow rate is given as \( Q = 9.5 \, \text{L/s} \), which is converted to \( Q = 0.0095 \, \text{m}^3/\text{s} \) (since \( 1 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{m}^3 \)).

The diameter of the pipe is \( 4.0 \, \text{cm} = 0.04 \, \text{m} \), so the radius is \( r = 0.02 \, \text{m} \). The cross-sectional area is calculated as:

\[
A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.02)^2 = 0.00125664 \, \text{m}^2
\]

Using the equation \( v = \frac{Q}{A} \), we solve for \( v \):

\[
v = \frac{0.0095}{0.00125664} \approx 7.56 \, \text{m/s}
\]

This value is closest to option \( I: 7.6 \, \text{m/s} \).
