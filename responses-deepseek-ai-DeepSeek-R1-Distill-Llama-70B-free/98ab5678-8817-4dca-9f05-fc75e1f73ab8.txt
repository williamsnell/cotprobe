Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about psychological theories, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. The question is asking about the idea that mental states are dispositions to behave in particular ways under certain circumstances. Hmm, I remember that different theories in psychology explain mental states in different ways.

Let me think about each option. Option A is functionalism. From what I recall, functionalism is more about the mental states being defined by their functional role, like their causal relations to other states and the environment. It's more of a modern view, I think, and might relate to how the mind works like a computer program.

Option B is psychoanalytic theory. That's Freudian stuff, right? It deals with the unconscious mind, repression, and so on. I don't think it's about behavior dispositions directly. So probably not B.

Option C is logical behaviorism. I remember behaviorism is about observable behavior rather than internal mental states. Logical behaviorism, if I'm not wrong, is the idea that mental statements can be translated into behavioral terms. So like, saying "I have a desire" is the same as saying I would behave in a certain way if certain conditions are met. That sounds a lot like what the question is describingâ€”mental states as dispositions to behave.

Option D is radical behaviorism. That's more extreme, I think, where even private thoughts are considered behaviors. It's associated with Skinner. It's about observable behavior without considering internal mental states. So maybe not exactly the same as the disposition idea, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's related.

Option E is methodological behaviorism. This approach focuses on studying observable behaviors while ignoring internal mental processes. It's more of a methodology rather than a theory explaining mental states. So probably not E.

Option F is structuralism. That's about breaking down the mind into structures or elements. It's old school, like Wundt and Titchener. Not directly about behavior dispositions.

Option G is cognitive psychology. That's about mental processes like thinking, memory, etc. It's the opposite of behaviorism, focusing on internal states rather than behavior. So G is probably not right.

Option H is eliminative materialism. That's the idea that mental states don't really exist and will be eliminated as science progresses, replaced by physical explanations. So it's more about denying mental states, not explaining them as behaviors.

Option I is dualism. That's the belief that mind and body are separate entities. It's about the nature of reality, not about behavior dispositions. So not I.

Option J is logical nominalism. I'm not sure about this one. It doesn't ring a bell related to the question. Maybe it's a distractor.

So putting it all together, the question is about mental states being dispositions to behave. Logical behaviorism (C) fits because it's about translating mental terms into behavioral dispositions. Radical behaviorism (D) is about behavior but more about external behavior without internal states. So the correct answer is C.

The question asks about the idea that mental states are dispositions to behave in particular ways under certain circumstances. After analyzing the options:

- **Functionalism (A)** defines mental states by their functional roles, not specifically as behavioral dispositions.
- **Psychoanalytic theory (B)** focuses on the unconscious mind, not behavioral dispositions.
- **Logical behaviorism (C)** translates mental statements into behavioral terms, aligning with the idea of mental states as dispositions to behave.
- **Radical behaviorism (D)** emphasizes observable behavior but doesn't frame mental states as dispositions.
- **Methodological behaviorism (E)** is a methodology, not a theory about mental states.
- **Structuralism (F)** and **cognitive psychology (G)** focus on internal mental processes, not behavioral dispositions.
- **Eliminative materialism (H)** denies the existence of mental states.
- **Dualism (I)** concerns the mind-body problem, not behavioral dispositions.
- **Logical nominalism (J)** is unrelated to the question.

The correct answer is **logical behaviorism (C)**, as it directly relates mental states to behavioral dispositions.

Answer: C
