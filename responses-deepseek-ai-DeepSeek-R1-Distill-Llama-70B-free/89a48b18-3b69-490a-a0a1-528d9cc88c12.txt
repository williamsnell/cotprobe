Okay, so I've got this question about the mobility of electrolytic ions and how different factors affect it. Hmm, let me think. I remember that ion mobility is how fast an ion moves under the influence of an electric field. It's related to things like their size, charge, the temperature, and the solvent's properties.

The question has four parts: a, b, c, d. I'll tackle each one by one.

(a) Increasing the size of the ion. I think larger ions are bigger and maybe have more mass. So in a solution, they might not move as quickly because it's harder for them to push through the solvent molecules. Like, smaller ions can zip through faster than big, bulky ones. So does increasing size make mobility decrease? I think that's right. So (a) should be decrease.

(b) Increasing the charge on the ion. Charge affects how much the ion is attracted to the electric field. A higher charge means a stronger force pulling or pushing the ion, so it should move faster. So if the charge increases, mobility increases. So (b) is increase.

(c) Increasing temperature. Temperature affects the viscosity of the solvent, right? When temperature goes up, the solvent's viscosity usually goes down. Less viscous means it's easier for ions to move. Also, higher temperature gives the ions more kinetic energy, so they move more. So increasing temperature should increase mobility. So (c) is increase.

(d) Placing it in a solvent of lower viscosity. Viscosity is the thickness of the solvent. Lower viscosity means the solution is less thick, so ions can move more easily. So mobility should increase when viscosity decreases. So (d) is increase.

Now, let me check the options. The parts are (a) decrease, (b) increase, (c) increase, (d) increase. So looking through the options:

Option C: a) Decrease, b) Increase, c) Increase, d) Increase. That fits what I thought.

Wait, let me double-check. Oh wait, another thought. The charge part: higher charge might cause more attraction, but maybe ions with higher charges are also more hydrated or have larger effective sizes because they hold onto more solvent molecules. That could actually decrease mobility. Oh, wait, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, wait. The charge effect. Higher charge would mean the ion is more strongly drawn to the electrode, so higher mobility. But in reality, the mobility also depends on the ion's size. I think for ions with higher charges, their mobility is generally higher because the electric field has a stronger effect on them. But wait, some highly charged ions might have higher hydration, making them larger and slowing them down. Hmm, but I think in general, higher charge increases mobility.

Wait, another thought. The key point is that mobility is influenced by both charge and the ion's size. So for (a), increasing size leads to lower mobility. For (b), higher charge increases mobility. So yes, I think my initial reasoning was correct.

So looking at the options again. Option C is (a) Decrease, (b) Increase, (c) Increase, (d) Increase. That's what I need.

To determine how the mobility of an electrolytic ion changes under different conditions, we analyze each factor:

1. **Increasing the size of the ion**: Larger ions have more mass and experience greater resistance as they move through the solvent. This makes it harder for them to move quickly, so mobility decreases.

2. **Increasing the charge on the ion**: A higher charge results in a stronger force from the electric field, pulling or pushing the ion more effectively. This generally increases mobility, though highly charged ions might experience increased hydration, which could slow them down. However, the dominant effect is the increased force from the electric field.

3. **Increasing temperature**: Higher temperature reduces the viscosity of the solvent and increases the kinetic energy of the ions, both of which enhance mobility.

4. **Placing the ion in a solvent of lower viscosity**: Lower viscosity means less resistance, allowing ions to move more easily and increasing mobility.

Combining these effects, the correct changes in mobility are:  
(a) Decrease, (b) Increase, (c) Increase, (d) Increase.  

The option that matches this is **C**.
