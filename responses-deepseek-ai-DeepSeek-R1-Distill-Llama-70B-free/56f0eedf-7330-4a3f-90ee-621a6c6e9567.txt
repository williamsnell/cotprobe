Question:

Which of the following statements about the immune system is NOT correct?

Options:

A: Innate immunity, also known as the adaptive immune response, relies on circulating phagocytes engulfing foreign substances.
B: Adaptive immunity is a slower response than innate immunity.
C: Innate immunity activates a humoral response.
D: Dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells.

Answer:

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the immune system, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which of the options is NOT correct. So I'll go through each option one by one.

Option A says: "Innate immunity, also known as the adaptive immune response, relies on circulating phagocytes engulfing foreign substances." Hmm, wait a second. I remember that the immune system has two main parts: innate and adaptive. Innate immunity is the first line of defense, and it's non-specific. Adaptive is the specific response that takes longer. So if A is calling innate immunity the adaptive response, that doesn't sound right. Oh wait, the wording is confusing. It says "Innate immunity, also known as the adaptive..." That can't be correct. Because they're two different things. So A seems incorrect. But I'll check the others to be sure.

Option B: "Adaptive immunity is a slower response than innate immunity." That makes sense. Adaptive takes time because it involves T and B cells, activation, proliferation, etc. Innate is immediate. So B is correct.

Option C: "Innate immunity activates a humoral response." Wait, what's a humoral response? I think humoral refers to the part of immunity involving antibodies, which is part of adaptive immunity. Oh wait, no. Wait, the humoral response is from B cells producing antibodies, which is adaptive. But wait, innate can activate some humoral aspects? Or does it refer to the overall activation. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, I think innate immunity can activate both humoral and cellular adaptive responses. So maybe C is correct because innate does initiate the adaptive responses, including humoral. Or maybe the statement is correct.

Option D: "Dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells." Yes, that's correct. Dendritic cells are key APCs, they process antigens and present them to T-cells. So D is correct.

So going back to option A: It says innate is also known as adaptive, which is wrong. So A is incorrect. So the incorrect statement would be option A. Because it's mixing up the two types. So the answer should be A.

The question asks which statement about the immune system is NOT correct. Let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: "Innate immunity, also known as the adaptive immune response, relies on circulating phagocytes engulfing foreign substances." This is incorrect because innate immunity and adaptive immunity are two distinct components of the immune system. Innate immunity is the first line of defense and is non-specific, while adaptive immunity is specific and takes longer to activate. Therefore, referring to innate immunity as "adaptive" is a mistake.

- **Option B**: "Adaptive immunity is a slower response than innate immunity." This is correct. Adaptive immunity involves T and B cells and takes time to develop, whereas innate immunity provides an immediate response.

- **Option C**: "Innate immunity activates a humoral response." This is correct. Innate immunity can trigger adaptive immune responses, including the humoral response (involving antibodies produced by B cells).

- **Option D**: "Dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells." This is correct. Dendritic cells are key antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that process and present antigens to T cells.

The incorrect statement is **Option A**, as it mislabels innate immunity as adaptive immunity.

Answer: A
