Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a markdown percentage. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the toy was originally priced at $2.25, and then it was marked down to $2.00. I need to find the percent of the markdown. 

Hmm, markdown percentage... I think that's the percentage decrease from the original price to the sale price. So I remember that percentage change is calculated by taking the difference, dividing by the original, and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

So the original price is $2.25, and the sale price is $2.00. The difference between them is $2.25 minus $2.00, which is $0.25. That makes sense because the markdown is the amount reduced from the original price.

Now, to find the markdown percentage, I take that difference ($0.25) and divide it by the original price ($2.25). Let me do that calculation. So 0.25 divided by 2.25. Hmm, let me see. 0.25 divided by 2.25... Well, 2.25 is the same as 9/4, right? Or 2 and 1/4. So 0.25 is 1/4. So 1/4 divided by 9/4 is (1/4) * (4/9) = 1/9. Oh wait, 1 divided by 9 is approximately 0.1111. 

To get the percentage, I multiply by 100, so that's about 11.11%. Looking at the options, I see option J is 11%, which is the closest. But wait, let me double-check the options. The choices are A:5%, B:12.5%, C:15%, D:10%, E:18%, F:22%, G:25%, H:9%, I:20%, J:11%. 

So J is 11%, which is pretty close to 11.11%. But wait, does the question ask for the exact percentage or rounded? Since 11.11 isn't an option, the closest is 11%. So the correct answer should be J.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So the steps again: original $2.25, new price $2.00. The markdown is 2.25 - 2.00 = 0.25. Then, markdown percentage is (0.25 / 2.25) * 100. 

Calculating 0.25 divided by 2.25. Let's do it differently. 2.25 goes into 0.25 how many times? Well, 2.25 * 0.1111 is about 0.25, right? Because 0.1111 * 2 is 0.2222, so 0.1111 * 2.25 is 0.25. So yes, that's correct. 

So the percentage is approximately 11.11%, which would round to 11% when rounded to the nearest whole number. So the answer is J.

The markdown percentage is calculated by determining the difference between the original price and the sale price, dividing by the original price, and then multiplying by 100. 

Original price = $2.25  
Sale price = $2.00  
Markdown amount = $2.25 - $2.00 = $0.25  

Markdown percentage = ($0.25 / $2.25) * 100 â‰ˆ 11.11%.  

Since 11.11% is closest to 11%, the correct answer is:

J: 11%  

Answer: J
