Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says there's an object with a volume of 2 × 10^-3 m³ and a weight of 6 N. It's placed into a tank of water and floats. I need to find out what percentage of the object's volume is above the water surface. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm, right. So when an object floats, the buoyant force equals the weight of the object. I remember that Archimedes' principle is involved here. Buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. So, the buoyant force (F_b) is equal to the weight of the water displaced, which is the volume of the submerged part multiplied by the density of water and gravity.

Let me jot down the formula: F_b = ρ_water * V_submerged * g.

Wait, the weight of the object is given as 6 N. Since the object is floating, the buoyant force must balance this weight. So F_b = 6 N.

Density of water is 1000 kg/m³, and g is 9.8 m/s². Let me plug in those values.

So, 6 N = 1000 kg/m³ * V_submerged * 9.8 m/s².

Wait, solving for V_submerged. Let's rearrange the equation:

V_submerged = 6 N / (1000 kg/m³ * 9.8 m/s²).

Calculating the denominator first: 1000 * 9.8 = 9800. So, 6 / 9800 = ?

6 divided by 9800. Let me compute that. 6 ÷ 9800 = 0.000612 m³. Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 6 N divided by (1000 * 9.8). That's 6/(1000*9.8) = 6/(9800) = 0.000612 m³. Yeah, that's correct. So the submerged volume is 0.000612 cubic meters.

Wait, the object's total volume is 2 × 10^-3 m³, which is 0.002 m³. So, the submerged part is 0.000612 m³, and the rest is above water.

So the volume above is total volume minus submerged. That's 0.002 - 0.000612 = 0.001388 m³.

Wait, but I need to find the percentage above. So (volume above / total volume) * 100.

So, (0.001388 / 0.002) * 100.

Let me compute that. 0.001388 divided by 0.002 equals 0.694. Multiply by 100 gives 69.4%. Wait, but that's not one of the options exactly. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: A is 80, B is 12, etc. Wait, option F is 70%, which is close. Hmm, but wait—did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, maybe I should double-check the numbers. Let me go through it again.

F_b = weight of object = 6 N.

F_b = ρ_water * V_submerged * g.

So V_submerged = F_b / (ρ_water * g) = 6 / (1000 * 9.8) = 6 / 9800.

6 divided by 9800 equals approximately 0.00061224 m³.

Total volume is 0.002 m³.

So the submerged volume is 0.00061224. So volume above is 0.002 - 0.00061224 = 0.00138776.

Percentage above: (0.00138776 / 0.002) *100 = 0.69388, so 69.388%. That's about 69.4%, which isn't exactly any of the options. The closest option is F:70%, but wait, maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I did a miscalculation in the division. Let me compute 6 ÷ 9800 more accurately.

6 ÷ 9800 = 0.000612244897959... So yeah, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. Oh wait, I'm using 9.8 m/s² for g. But sometimes, in problems, g is approximated as 10 for simplicity. Let me see if that would change things.

If g is 10, then V_submerged = 6/(1000 * 10) = 6/10000 = 0.0006 m³.

Volume above would then be 0.002 - 0.0006 = 0.0014 m³.

Percentage: (0.0014 / 0.002) *100 = 0.7, which is 70%. That is option F.

Ah, so perhaps the problem uses g = 10 m/s² for simplicity. That would explain it.

So the correct answer would be 70% submerged, which would mean 30% above? Wait no, wait. Wait a second, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Wait, if the submerged volume is 0.000612 m³ (using 9.8), then 0.000612 / 0.002 = 0.306, so 30.6% submerged. So 69.4% is above. But that's not matching any options exactly.

Wait wait, perhaps I messed up. Alternatively, let me think about it this way: percentage above is (total volume - submerged volume)/total volume ×100. So (0.002 - 0.000612)/0.002 ×100 = (0.001388)/(0.002) ×100 = 69.4%.

But the options don't have 69.4. So perhaps the approximation is intended.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the specific gravity. The fraction submerged is equal to the ratio of the object's density to water's density.

Wait, the object's weight is 6 N. Volume is 0.002 m³, so mass is weight / g. Mass = 6 / 9.8 ≈ 0.612 kg.

Density of object, ρ_obj = mass / volume = 0.612 kg / 0.002 m³ = 306 kg/m³.

Water's density is 1000 kg/m³. So the fraction submerged is ρ_obj / ρ_water = 306 / 1000 = 0.306, so 30.6% submerged. So 100 - 30.6 = 69.4% above water.

Again, 69.4% is not an option. So perhaps the question expects us to use g=10 m/s².

So with g=10, mass is 6/10=0.6 kg. So ρ_obj=0.6 / 0.002=300 kg/m³.

Fraction submerged is 300/1000=0.3 → 30% submerged, so 70% above. So the percentage above is 70%, which is option F.

Wait, but the options list 70% as F. So that must be the intended answer. So the correct answer is F:70%.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting results. Let me make sure.

Wait, let me recalculate using g=9.8 and see if perhaps I made a mistake in the buoyant force calculation.

F_b = 6 N = ρ_water * V_submerged * g.

So V_submerged = 6/(1000 *9.8) = 6/(9800) = 0.00061224 m³.

Total volume is 0.002 m³. So submerged is 0.00061224, which is 30.61224% of the total volume. So the submerged portion is approximately 30.61%, so the part above is 69.39%, which is roughly 69.4%. Since none of the options match this, perhaps the question assumes g=10, which gives exactly 30% submerged, so 70% above.

So the correct answer must be F:70%, which is option F.
</think>

To determine the percentage of the object's volume above the water surface, we use Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced fluid. The buoyant force is given by:

\[
F_b = \rho_{\text{water}} \cdot V_{\text{submerged}} \cdot g
\]

Here:
- \( F_b = 6 \, \text{N} \) (weight of the object),
- \( \rho_{\text{water}} = 1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \) (density of water),
- \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) (acceleration due to gravity),
- \( V_{\text{submerged}} \) is the submerged volume of the object.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( V_{\text{submerged}} \):

\[
V_{\text{submerged}} = \frac{F_b}{\rho_{\text{water}} \cdot g}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
V_{\text{submerged}} = \frac{6}{1000 \cdot 9.8} = \frac{6}{9800} \approx 0.000612 \, \text{m}^3
\]

The total volume of the object is \( V_{\text{total}} = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}^3 = 0.002 \, \text{m}^3 \). The volume above the water surface is:

\[
V_{\text{above}} = V_{\text{total}} - V_{\text{submerged}} = 0.002 - 0.000612 = 0.001388 \, \text{m}^3
\]

The percentage of the object's volume above the water surface is:

\[
\text{Percentage above} = \left( \frac{V_{\text{above}}}{V_{\text{total}}} \right) \cdot 100 = \left( \frac{0.001388}{0.002} \right) \cdot 100 \approx 69.4\%
\]

However, none of the provided options match 69.4%. If we approximate \( g = 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) for simplicity:

\[
V_{\text{submerged}} = \frac{6}{1000 \cdot 10} = 0.0006 \, \text{m}^3
\]

The volume above the water surface becomes:

\[
V_{\text{above}} = 0.002 - 0.0006 = 0.0014 \, \text{m}^3
\]

The percentage above is:

\[
\text{Percentage above} = \left( \frac{0.0014}{0.002} \right) \cdot 100 = 70\%
\]

Thus, the percentage of the object's volume above the water surface is approximately **70%**, which corresponds to option **F**.
