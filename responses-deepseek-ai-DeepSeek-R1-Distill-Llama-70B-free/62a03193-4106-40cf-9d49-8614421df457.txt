Okay, so I have this economics question about fiscal policy and its effects on GDP and the price level during a recession. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says the economy is in a recession. I remember that during a recession, the economy is operating below its potential, so there's excess capacity and unemployment is high.

The plan is to decrease taxes for consumers and increase government spending. Wait, so that's a fiscal policy approach. Lower taxes mean people have more disposable income, right? And increasing government purchases would mean the government is spending more on goods and services.

So, how does this affect real GDP and the price level? I think when the government cuts taxes, consumers have more money to spend. That increases aggregate demand because people buy more stuff. Similarly, when the government increases its own purchases, that's another direct increase in aggregate demand. So both actions should stimulate the economy.

But wait, I should consider whether the economy is operating at or below full employment. Since it's a recession, we're below full employment, so resources are idle. An increase in aggregate demand should lead to an increase in real GDP because businesses can ramp up production without immediately hitting bottlenecks or inflationary pressures.

Now, about the price level. In the short run, especially when there's a recession, prices might not increase much because there's excess supply. So even with increased demand, firms might not raise prices right away because they have unused capacity and want to sell more. So the price level might not rise as much as it would in a booming economy.

Wait, but could it cause inflation? Maybe not immediately. If the economy is in a recession, the additional demand might just lead to higher output without pushing prices up. So real GDP would increase, and the price level might remain the same or not rise significantly.

So the options are: Looking at the choices, which one says real GDP rises and the price level remains the same? Option B says real GDP rises and price level remains same. Or option H which is GDP rises and price level falls. Hmm, how about that.

Wait, does cutting taxes and increasing government spending cause the price level to fall? I don't think so. Lower taxes increase demand, and higher government spending also increases demand. So aggregate demand shifts right. So if AD shifts right and the economy is below full employment, the SRAS curve is likely to be upward sloping but in the region where it's more flat, so more demand leads to higher output with little change in price.

Wait, but in the short run, the price level might not change much because firms adjust their prices slowly. So the increase in AD would lead to higher real GDP without a significant change in the price level. So that would point to option B: real GDP rises, price level remains same.

Alternatively, if prices do change, maybe they could slightly rise. But if the economy is in a recession, the inflation rate might be low or even deflationary. So I'm a bit confused between B and C.

Wait, the question is about a plan to decrease taxes and increase government purchases. Both are expansionary fiscal policies. So they should both increase aggregate demand. If AD increases and the economy is below full employment, the effect is a higher GDP because the SRAS is in the elastic region where prices don't change much. So prices remain the same, and GDP goes up. So that's option B.

Wait, but what if the increased demand does cause some price increases? In that case, maybe option C. But I think in a recession, the price level is more likely to remain flat because of underutilized resources.

Another angle: the multiplier effect. Lower taxes increase disposable income, leading to more consumption. More government spending directly increases demand. Both boost AD, leading to higher output. Since the economy is operating below capacity, higher output (GDP) without much inflation. So price level remains same.

So the correct answer would be option B: real GDP rises and the price level remains the same.

During a recession, the economy operates below its potential, with excess capacity and high unemployment. A plan to decrease taxes for consumers and increase government spending is an expansionary fiscal policy. Lower taxes increase disposable income, boosting consumer spending, while higher government purchases directly increase aggregate demand. Both actions stimulate the economy, leading to higher real GDP.

In a recession, the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve is relatively flat due to underutilized resources. An increase in aggregate demand (AD) primarily results in higher output rather than significant price increases. While prices might rise slightly, they are more likely to remain stable because firms, facing excess capacity, are less likely to raise prices immediately.

Considering the options, the most accurate outcome is that real GDP rises while the price level remains largely unchanged. This aligns with option B.

Answer: B
