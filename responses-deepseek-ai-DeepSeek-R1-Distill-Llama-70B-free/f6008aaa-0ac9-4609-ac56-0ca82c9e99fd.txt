Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about how many four-letter code words are possible using the letters in "IOWA" without repeating any letters. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I think I remember that when dealing with permutations without repetition, the number of possible arrangements is calculated using factorial. Since we're selecting 4 letters out of the available ones and not repeating, it's a permutation problem.

Wait, but wait. What's the word here? "IOWA"â€”so let me count the letters. I-O-W-A. That's four letters, right? I, O, W, A. So there are four distinct letters. Oh, wait, no. Wait, does "IOWA" have any repeating letters? Let's see: I, O, W, A. Each appears once. So four unique letters.

But wait, the code word is four letters long, and we can't repeat any letters. So we're selecting all four letters, but arranging them in different orders. Oh wait, that's the permutation of 4 letters taken 4 at a time.

The formula for permutations when selecting r items out of n without repetition is n! / (n-r)!. In this case, n is 4 and r is 4. So it's 4! / (4-4)! which is 4! / 0! Since 0! is 1, it simplifies to 4! = 24. So there should be 24 possible code words.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Is the word "IOWA" implying that we have more letters than that? Wait, no, I-O-W-A are four letters. So if the code is four letters and you can't repeat any letters, you have to use all four letters exactly once each. So the number of possible arrangements is 4 factorial, which is 24.

Looking at the options, option H is 24. So the answer should be H.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The letters may not be repeated, so each code word uses each letter exactly once. So for the first position, I have 4 choices. The second position, since one letter is used, 3 left. Third position, 2 letters left. Last one, 1 letter. So 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24. Yep, that's correct.

So the answer is H: 24.

The question asks how many four-letter code words can be formed using the letters in "IOWA" without repeating any letters. The word "IOWA" consists of four distinct letters: I, O, W, and A. Since the code word must also be four letters long and no letters can be repeated, we are essentially finding the number of permutations of these four letters.

The formula for permutations of \( n \) items taken \( r \) at a time is:

\[
P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
\]

Here, \( n = 4 \) and \( r = 4 \), so:

\[
P(4, 4) = \frac{4!}{(4-4)!} = \frac{4!}{0!} = 4! = 24
\]

Thus, there are 24 possible four-letter code words. This matches option H.

H: 24
