Okay, so I've got this cyclotron problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that a cyclotron has an oscillator frequency of 11.4 megacycles per second, and a radius of 60 cm. We need to find the magnetic induction required to accelerate protons. Also, we have to find the final energy the protons acquire and the error made by assuming the proton's mass remains constant.

Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons use magnetic fields to make charged particles move in circular paths. The key formula here is probably related to the cyclotron frequency, which I think is given by f = (qB)/(2πm), where q is the charge, B is the magnetic induction, m is the mass, and f is the frequency.

Wait, actually, let me get that right. The cyclotron frequency formula is f = (qB)/(2πm), right. So we can rearrange that to solve for B. Oh yeah, B = (2πf m)/(q).

Got it. So let me plug in the numbers. The frequency given is 11.4 Mc/s, which is 11.4 x 10^6 cycles per second. The charge q is 1.6 x 10^-19 C. The mass m is 1.67 x 10^-27 kg.

Wait, yeah. So let me compute B first. Let's see:

f = 11.4e6 Hz,
m = 1.67e-27 kg,
q = 1.6e-19 C.

So B = (2 * π * 11.4e6 * 1.67e-27) / (1.6e-19)

Let me calculate that step by step.

First, 2 * π is about 6.2832.

Multiply that by 11.4e6: 6.2832 * 11.4e6 = approximately 71.74e6.

Then multiply by 1.67e-27: 71.74e6 * 1.67e-27 = (71.74 * 1.67) * 10^(-21). Let's calculate 71.74 * 1.67. 70*1.6 is 112, 1.74*1.67 is about 2.9, so total around 114.9. So that's 114.9e-21.

Wait, wait, better to compute accurately:

71.74 * 1.67 = let's see:

70 * 1.67 = 116.9
1.74 * 1.67 = approx 2.9058
So total 116.9 + 2.9058 = 119.8058 ≈ 119.81.

So 119.81e-21, which is 1.1981e-19.

Then divide by 1.6e-19:

(1.1981e-19) / (1.6e-19) = 1.1981 / 1.6 ≈ 0.749.

So B is approximately 0.749 Tesla, which is 0.75 T. Looking at the options, option C is 0.75 Wb/m², which matches this.

Wait, let me check the calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait another approach: Let's compute it more accurately.

Compute numerator: 2 * π * f * m.

2 * π ≈ 6.2832.

6.2832 * 11.4e6 = 6.2832 * 11,400,000.

Let me compute 6 * 11.4e6 = 68.4e6, 0.2832 * 11.4e6 ≈ 3.23e6. So total is about 71.63e6.

Then multiply by 1.67e-27 kg:

71.63e6 * 1.67e-27 = (71.63 * 1.67) * 1e-21.

71.63 * 1.67: let's compute 70 * 1.67 = 116.9, 1.63 * 1.67 ≈ 2.72. So total 119.62.

So 119.62e-21 = 1.1962e-19.

Divide by q=1.6e-19:

1.1962e-19 / 1.6e-19 = 0.7476 Tesla, so approximately 0.748 T, which is 0.748 Wb/m². So looking at the options, G is 0.748, but in the options, option G is 0.748, but wait, let me check the options again.

Wait the options are:

A: 0.77,

B:0.72,

C:0.75,

D:0.80,

E:0.76,

F:0.65,

G:0.748,

H:0.68,

I:0.73,

J:0.70.

So from my calculation, 0.748 T, which is 0.748 Wb/m². So that's option G. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes the exact value of pi matters.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more precisely without approximations.

Let me compute 2 * pi = 6.283185307.

6.283185307 * 11.4e6 = let's compute 6.283185307 * 11,400,000.

6 * 11.4e6 = 68.4e6.

0.283185307 * 11.4e6 = 0.283185307 * 11,400,000 = approx 3,228,482.37.

So total is 68,400,000 + 3,228,482.37 = 71,628,482.37 Hz.

Then multiply by 1.67e-27 kg:

71,628,482.37 * 1.67e-27 = ?

So 71,628,482.37 * 1.67 = let's compute that.

70,000,000 * 1.67 = 116,900,000.

1,628,482.37 * 1.67 ≈ 2,720,000.

So total approximately 119,620,000.

So 119,620,000e-27 kg·Hz.

Wait, but wait, the units: Hz is 1/s, so 71.628e6 * 1.67e-27 = (71,628,482.37 * 1.67) * 1e-27.

Wait, 71,628,482.37 * 1.67 = let's compute it accurately.

71,628,482.37 * 1.67 = ?

Let me compute 71,628,482 * 1.67:

71,628,482 * 1 = 71,628,482.

71,628,482 * 0.6 = 42,977,089.2.

71,628,482 * 0.07 = 5,014,  (wait 71,628,482 * 0.07 = 5,014,  (7*71,628,482 is 501,409,374, so 0.07 is 5,014, 093.74? Wait, maybe easier to just compute 71,628,482 * 1.67 = ?

Alternatively, 71,628,482.37 * 1.67 = approximately 71,628,482 * 1.67.

Let me use a calculator approach:

71,628,482 * 1.67 = ?

71,628,482 * 1 = 71,628,482.

71,628,482 * 0.6 = 42,977,089.2.

71,628,482 * 0.07 = 5,014,093.74.

Adding those together: 71,628,482 + 42,977,089.2 = 114,605,571.2 + 5,014,093.74 = 119,619,664.94.

So approximately 1.19619664e8 (1.19619664 x 10^8) when multiplied by 1e-27 gives 1.19619664e-19.

Now, divide by q, which is 1.6e-19 C.

So B = (1.19619664e-19) / (1.6e-19) = (1.19619664 / 1.6) = approx 0.7476235 T, which is 0.7476 T or 0.748 Wb/m².

So looking at the options, option G is 0.748 Wb/m². So the magnetic induction is option G first part.

Wait, no, wait the options: looking back, option G is 0.748 Wb m⁻², so that seems correct.

But wait, another thought: I think in cyclotrons, the radius is related to the maximum speed, but wait, in this problem, the radius given is 60 cm, but I didn't use it in calculating B. Oh wait, because the formula for B relies on the frequency, which is given. The radius is used for something else, perhaps the energy.

Wait, right. So the radius of the cyclotron is the maximum radius a particle reaches before it's extracted. And the energy can be found using the relation (q² B² R²)/(2m), or using another formula.

Wait, the kinetic energy (K.E.) of the proton when it reaches the radius R is given by K.E. = (q² B² R²) / (2m). Or alternatively, using K.E. = (1/2) m v², and since the magnetic force provides the centripetal force, qvB = mv²/R → v = (qB R)/m.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The kinetic energy can be found as (1/2) m v², where v is the maximum velocity before the proton exits the cyclotron.

Alternatively, using the relation K.E. = (q² B² R²) / (2m). Let me confirm that.

Yes, because from qvB = mv²/R → v = (qBR)/m. Then K.E. is (1/2) m v² = (1/2) m (q² B² R² / m² ) = (q² B² R²) / (2m).

So plugging the numbers:

q = 1.6e-19 C,

B is 0.748 T,

R = 0.6 m (since 60 cm is 0.6 m),

m = 1.67e-27 kg.

So K.E. = (1.6e-19)^2 * (0.748)^2 * (0.6)^2 / (2 * 1.67e-27)

Let me compute each part step by step.

(1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

(0.748)^2 ≈ 0.559 T².

(0.6)^2 = 0.36 m².

Multiply those together: 2.56e-38 * 0.559 * 0.36.

Let me compute 2.56e-38 * 0.559 = approx 1.432e-38.

Then multiply by 0.36: 1.432e-38 * 0.36 ≈ 5.155e-39.

Now, divide by denominator 2 * 1.67e-27 = 3.34e-27.

So K.E. = 5.155e-39 / 3.34e-27 ≈ 1.544e-12 J.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the options are in the order of 1e-11 J or lower. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me recalculate that.

Wait, first, let's calculate the numerator properly:

(1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

Multiply by B^2: (0.748)^2 = 0.559, so 2.56e-38 * 0.559 = 1.43264e-38.

Multiply by R^2: (0.6)^2 = 0.36, so 1.43264e-38 * 0.36 = 5.157e-39.

Denominator: 2m = 2 * 1.67e-27 = 3.34e-27.

So K.E. = 5.157e-39 / 3.34e-27 = (5.157 / 3.34) * 1e-12.

5.157 / 3.34 ≈ 1.544, so 1.544e-12 J, which is 1.544 × 10^-12 J.

Wait, but none of the options have that. Wait, the options for the second part are all around 1e-11 J. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check.

Alternative approach: K.E. = (1/2) m v².

And from the cyclotron, the velocity v = (q B R) / m.

So v = (1.6e-19 C * 0.748 T * 0.6 m) / (1.67e-27 kg).

Compute numerator: 1.6e-19 * 0.748 ≈ 1.1968e-19.

Multiply by 0.6: 1.1968e-19 * 0.6 = 7.1808e-20.

So v = 7.1808e-20 / 1.67e-27 ≈ (7.1808 / 1.67) * 1e7.

7.18 / 1.67 ≈ 4.3, so v ≈ 4.3e7 m/s.

Then K.E. = 1/2 * m * v².

m = 1.67e-27 kg.

v squared: (4.3e7)^2 = 18.49e14 = 1.849e15 m²/s².

So K.E. = 0.5 * 1.67e-27 * 1.849e15.

0.5 * 1.67e-27 = 8.35e-28.

Multiply by 1.849e15: 8.35e-28 * 1.849e15 = (8.35 * 1.849) * 1e-13.

8.35 * 1.849 ≈ let's see, 8 * 1.8 = 14.4, 8 * 0.049 = 0.392, 0.35 * 1.8 = 0.63, 0.35 * 0.049≈0.017. Summing up: 14.4 + 0.392 = 14.792 + 0.63 = 15.422 + 0.017≈15.439.

So 15.439e-13 J → 1.5439e-12 J, same as before.

Hmm, but the options have values like 0.158e-11 J, which is 1.58e-12 J. So my calculation gives 1.54e-12 J, which is around 0.154e-11 J. So looking at the options, option G says 0.154e-11 J, so that would be 1.54e-12 J.

So, the energy is approximately 0.154e-11 J, which is part of option G.

So according to that, the B is 0.748 T and energy is 0.154e-11 J, which is option G.

But wait, let me check another approach. Maybe I should compute the energy using the cyclotron frequency and radius.

Another formula I recall is K.E. = (1/2) m (ω r)^2, where ω is the angular frequency, and r is the radius.

Wait, ω is 2πf, so f is 11.4e6 Hz.

So ω = 2π * 11.4e6 ≈ 7.15e7 rad/s.

r is 0.6 m.

So v = ω r = 7.15e7 * 0.6 = 4.29e7 m/s.

Then K.E. = 0.5 * 1.67e-27 * (4.29e7)^2.

(4.29e7)^2 = 18.4e14 = 1.84e15.

So K.E. = 0.5 * 1.67e-27 * 1.84e15.

0.5 * 1.67e-27 = 8.35e-28.

8.35e-28 * 1.84e15 = (8.35 * 1.84) * 1e-13.

8.35 * 1.84 ≈ let's see: 8 * 1.84 = 14.72, 0.35 * 1.84 = 0.644, so total 15.364.

So 15.364e-13 J → 1.5364e-12 J, which again is about 0.1536e-11 J, so 0.154e-11 J.

So that's consistent with option G, which has 0.154e-11 J.

Now, the third part is the error made by assuming the mass remains constant. So protons are non-relativistic? If their speed approaches a significant fraction of the speed of light, their relativistic mass increases, but at what speed does that become significant.

In this case, v is about 4.3e7 m/s. The speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, so v/c ≈ 0.143, which is about 14.3%. So the error in assuming non-relativistic (constant mass) would be about (v²/c²)/ (1 + (v²/c²)), but perhaps more accurately, the error in kinetic energy when using non-relativistic formula would be the difference between relativistic and non-relativistic.

Wait, but another approach: the relativistic mass is gamma times the rest mass. So if the speed is v, then gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the error would be (gamma - 1) * 100%, because if you ignore gamma, you're assuming m is constant.

So let's compute gamma.

v = 4.3e7 m/s,
