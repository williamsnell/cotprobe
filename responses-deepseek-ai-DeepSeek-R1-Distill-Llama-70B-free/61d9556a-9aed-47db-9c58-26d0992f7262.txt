Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the scientific characteristics of psychology. Hmm, I remember from my classes that psychology is a science, but I need to think about what makes it scientific.

The question gives options A through J, each describing different characteristics. I need to pick the correct one that lists the scientific aspects of psychology.

First, let's break down the key points. Psychology is a science, so it must use empirical methods. Empirical means based on observation and experiment, right? So any option saying it's not empirical or doesn't use measurement would be incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: It's a natural science studying inanimate objects. Wait, psychology studies behavior and mental processes, not inanimate things. So A is wrong.

Option B: Based on intuition and opinion. No, science relies on evidence, not just feelings or opinions. B is incorrect.

Option C: Not empirical. No, psychology does use empirical methods, so C is wrong.

Option D: Empirical, systematic, uses measurement. That sounds right. Psychology uses systematic methods and measures variables like behavior, cognition, etc.

Option E: Random observation without systematic methods. No, psychology uses systematic observation, so E is wrong.

Option F: Studies only groups, ignoring individuals. No, psychology looks at both individual differences and group behaviors. F is wrong.

Option G: Only animal behavior, not humans. No, psychology includes human behavior. G is wrong.

Option H: Theoretical without experimentation. No, psychology does have practical experiments. H is wrong.

Option I: Pseudoscience. No, psychology is a real science with testable hypotheses. I is wrong.

Option J: Doesn't use measurement. No, psychology does use measurements. J is wrong.

So the correct answer must be D. It correctly identifies that psychology is empirical, systematic, and uses measurement techniques.

The correct answer is the option that accurately describes psychology's scientific characteristics. Psychology is empirical, systematic, and employs measurement techniques.

Answer: D
