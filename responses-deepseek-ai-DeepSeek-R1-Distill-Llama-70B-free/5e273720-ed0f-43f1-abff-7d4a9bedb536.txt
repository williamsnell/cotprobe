Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Erikson's stages of psychosocial development. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Erik Erikson proposed a theory that includes eight stages of development. Each stage has a specific conflict or crisis that needs to be resolved. The stages are sequential, covering from infancy to old age.

The first stage, I think, is about trust versus mistrust. Infants learn to trust if their caregivers are reliable. If not, they might develop mistrust. So that's stage one.

The second stage is probably autonomy versus shame and doubt. This is the toddler phase where kids start asserting independence. If they're discouraged too much, they feel ashamed or doubtful.

Stage three, I believe, is initiative versus guilt. This happens during early school age. Children take on more responsibilities and roles, but if they're made to feel guilty for their actions, that's a problem.

Stage four is industry versus inferiority. Around middle childhood, kids start doing productive tasks. Success gives them a sense of industry, while failure can make them feel inferior.

Then comes stage five: identity versus role confusion. Adolescents explore their identities and may face confusion about their roles in society if they can't find a clear path.

Stage six is intimacy versus isolation. Young adults seek meaningful relationships. If they fail, they might feel isolated.

Stage seven is generativity versus stagnation. Adults focus on contributing to society, like raising a family or mentoring. Stagnation happens if they don't feel they're making a difference.

Finally, stage eight is ego integrity versus despair. Older adults reflect on their lives. Integrity comes from feeling fulfilled, while despair arises if they're unhappy with their accomplishments.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C lists the stages as: (1) trust vs. mistrust, (2) autonomy vs. shame and doubt, (3) initiative vs. guilt, (4) industry vs. inferiority, (5) identity vs. role confusion, (6) intimacy vs. isolation, (7) generativity vs. stagnation, and (8) ego integrity vs. despair. That matches exactly what I was thinking.

Other options don't fit. Option A uses terms I don't recognize like survival vs. extinction. Option B seems to mix up some Freudian stages with Erikson's, like oral-sensory which is more Freud. Option D just lists age groups without the crises. Option E talks about things like oral-auditory, which doesn't fit. Option F has some similar terms but not all correct. Option G is about age ranges again. Option H has different terms. Option I and J also don't align with what I remember.

So I'm confident the correct answer is option C.

The correct answer is option C because it accurately lists Erikson's eight stages of psychosocial development, each with their corresponding conflict. These stages are sequential, spanning from infancy to late adulthood, and include: trust vs. mistrust, autonomy vs. shame and doubt, initiative vs. guilt, industry vs. inferiority, identity vs. role confusion, intimacy vs. isolation, generativity vs. stagnation, and ego integrity vs. despair.

Answer: C
