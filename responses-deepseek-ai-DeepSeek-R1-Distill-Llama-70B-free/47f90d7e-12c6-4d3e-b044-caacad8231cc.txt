Okay, so I've got this math problem here about finding the surface area of a right rectangular prism. Hmm, I remember that a rectangular prism has six faces, and the surface area is the sum of the areas of all these faces. Oh right, the formula given is S = 2(lw + wh + hl). Let me make sure I understand that correctly. 

So, the problem gives me the length, width, and height. Let's see, the length is 12 inches, the width is 9 inches, and the height is 2 inches. I need to plug these values into the formula.

Wait, let me write the formula out again to visualize it better: S equals two times the quantity (lw plus wh plus hl). So I have to calculate each of these products and then add them together, then multiply by two. 

First, let's compute lw. That's length times width, which is 12 * 9. Let me do that multiplication. 12 times 9 is 108. Okay, got that part. 

Next up is wh. That's width times height, so 9 * 2. 9 times 2 is 18. Easy enough. 

Then, hl. That's height times length. Wait, so that's 2 * 12. Oh, that's 24. 

Now, I need to add these three results together. So 108 plus 18 is 126, and then 126 plus 24. Let me see, 126 plus 24 is 150. 

Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Because 108 +18 is 126, and 126 +24 is 150? Let me check that again. 108 plus 18 is indeed 126. Then adding 24 to 126: 126 +20 is 146, plus 4 is 150. Yeah, that's correct. 

So the sum inside the parentheses is 150. Now, I have to multiply that by 2, as per the formula. So 150 times 2 is 300. 

Wait, but looking at the answer options, option A is 300. So is that the correct answer? But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes.

Let me recalculate each part. 

lw: 12 *9 = 108. Correct. 

wh: 9 *2=18. Correct. 

hl: 2 *12=24. Correct. 

Adding them: 108 +18=126, 126 +24=150. Multiply by 2: 150*2=300. So yes, that's 300. 

But wait a second, the surface area is 300 square inches? Hmm, the options include 300 as option A. But let me think again. Maybe I mixed up the formula somewhere.

Oh wait, wait! Wait a minute. Because sometimes I might confuse surface area formulas. Let me make sure I didn't. The formula for the surface area of a rectangular prism is indeed 2(lw + lh + wh). So I think I did that correctly. 

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the individual faces. A rectangular prism has two of each face: two with area l*w, two with area w*h, and two with area h*l. So adding them all together, it's 2lw + 2wh + 2hl, which factors to 2(lw + wh + hl). So yes, that's correct.

So plugging the numbers in again: 

lw =12*9=108 

wh=9*2=18 

hl=2*12=24 

Sum is 108+18=126 +24=150 

Multiply by 2: 300. So the surface area is 300 square inches. 

Looking back at the options: option A is 300. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me check the options again because sometimes I might misread them.

Options: 

A: 300 

B:92 

C:150 

D:258 

E:276 

F:210 

G:225 

H:268 

I:320 

J:180 

Yep, A is 300. So that's the one. 

Unless I made a calculation mistake. Let me do each step again. 

12 *9 is 108. 9*2 is 18. 12*2 is 24. 108+18=126. 126+24=150. 150*2=300. All correct. 

So the answer should be A:300.

To find the surface area of a right rectangular prism with length \( l = 12 \) inches, width \( w = 9 \) inches, and height \( h = 2 \) inches, we use the formula:

\[
S = 2(lw + wh + hl)
\]

### Step 1: Calculate each term inside the parentheses
1. \( lw = 12 \times 9 = 108 \)
2. \( wh = 9 \times 2 = 18 \)
3. \( hl = 2 \times 12 = 24 \)

### Step 2: Add the terms together
\[
108 + 18 + 24 = 150
\]

### Step 3: Multiply by 2
\[
S = 2 \times 150 = 300
\]

Thus, the surface area of the prism is \( 300 \) square inches. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**A: 300**
