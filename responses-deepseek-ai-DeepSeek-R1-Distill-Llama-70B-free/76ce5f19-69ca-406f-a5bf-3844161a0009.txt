Question:

Congress recently enacted a statute permitting a governmental agency to make a gift of federal property to private individuals or organizations, provided that it be used "to further good relations and better understanding with foreign governments. "The Secretary of Defense planned to give an old military cargo plane to a national organization who supports future pilots. Before making the gift, the Secretary was approached by the head of a church. The church leader indicated that he would be sponsoring a worldwide crusade and suggested to the Secretary that such an undertaking would serve to strengthen relations with foreign governments. The Secretary donated the plane to the church instead of the organization. Who would have the best standing to challenge the Secretary's action?

Options:

A: The Secretary of Defense himself.
B: The national organization.
C: A federal court.
D: A taxpayer of the United States.
E: A member of the church.
F: A member of Congress.
G: Any resident in the United States.
H: A citizen of the United States.
I: A foreign government.
J: A state within the United States.

Okay, so I've got this question about administrative law, I think. It's about standing to challenge a governmental action. Hmm, standing is a legal term that refers to the right of a party to bring a lawsuit. To have standing, a party must show that they have suffered some injury in fact, causation, and redressability.

So the question is about the Secretary of Defense giving a military cargo plane as a gift. The statute says the gift must be used "to further good relations and better understanding with foreign governments." The Secretary was planning to give it to a national organization that supports future pilots, but then a church leader approached him. The church is doing a worldwide crusade and says this will strengthen relations with foreign governments. So the Secretary gave the plane to the church instead.

The question is who has the best standing to challenge the Secretary's action. The options are from A to J.

First, I need to think about who would have standing here. The people or entities affected by the Secretary's decision are the national organization, the church, maybe taxpayers, or Congress.

Standing requires that the plaintiff has an injury that's concrete and particularized, not just general. Also, the injury must be caused by the defendant's conduct, and a favorable decision should redress the injury.

Let's go through the options.

Option A: The Secretary of Defense himself. That doesn't make sense. He's the one who made the decision; he wouldn't challenge his own action. So A is out.

Option B: The national organization. They were the ones who were initially planning to receive the plane but didn't. They might have a claim that the Secretary acted beyond his authority. So they could argue that they were supposed to get the plane, but it was given to someone else. Their injury is the loss of the plane, which is concrete. So B might have standing.

Option C: A federal court. Wait, no. The federal court itself doesn't have standing; standing is about who can bring a case to the court. So C is not the right answer. It's the plaintiff that needs standing, not the court.

Option D: A taxpayer of the United States. Taxpayer standing is tricky. Generally, taxpayers can't challenge federal expenditures unless it's a violation of a specific constitutional limitation, like the Establishment Clause in religious cases. Here, the issue is whether the gift follows the statutory purpose. So a taxpayer might argue that the Secretary exceeded his authority, but I'm not sure if that's enough for standing. The Supreme Court has usually limited taxpayer standing to cases involving the First Amendment, like in Flast v. Cohen. So unless there's a religious angle here, D might not have standing.

Option E: A member of the church. The church received the plane. Why would a member challenge that? They might not have an injury because they got the benefit. Unless they have some other issue, but I don't think they'd have standing to challenge the Secretary's decision because they're the beneficiaries. So E is probably not the right choice.

Option F: A member of Congress. Members of Congress can sometimes have standing, especially if the action affects their legislative prerogatives. For instance, if Congress had a say in how the property is disposed of, a member might argue that the Secretary's action violated the law and thus their authority. But I'm not sure if individual members have standing in such cases. It might depend on whether the action affects the institutional power of Congress. Alternatively, the member could argue that they have a right to ensure that funds or property are used according to statute. So F is a possibility.

Option G: Any resident in the United States. Residents would have a hard time showing particularized injury. Being a resident alone isn't enough; they need a specific harm. So G is unlikely to have standing.

Option H: A citizen of the United States. Similar to G, citizens generally don't have standing just because they're citizens unless there's a specific injury. So H is probably out.

Option I: A foreign government. Foreign governments can sometimes bring suits in US courts, but they'd need to show that the action affects their interests. Here, the Secretary's decision is about how the US uses its property. A foreign government might not have standing unless they can show a direct injury, which seems unlikely here. So I probably isn't the best choice.

Option J: A state within the United States. States can have standing, especially when federal actions impact their interests. But in this case, the decision is about giving a plane, which doesn't directly impact a state's sovereignty or specific interests unless the plane was located in a particular state or the state had some claim to it. I don't think that's indicated here, so J is probably not the right answer.

So now, narrowing it down. The main contenders are B, D, F.

The national organization in B was supposed to get the plane, but didn't. They can argue that the Secretary's decision was arbitrary and capricious or not in line with the statute's purpose. They have a concrete injury—the loss of the plane, which they were planning to use. So B has standing.

A taxpayer in D might argue that the Secretary misused federal property, but unless it's a clear constitutional violation, taxpayer standing is limited. Here, the issue is statutory, so D might not have standing.

A member of Congress in F could argue that the Secretary's action is a violation of the statute, which Congress passed, thus affecting their legislative authority. But individual members don't always have standing unless it's a matter of their own powers being usurped. It's a bit more of a stretch than the organization's clear injury.

So the best standing would be the national organization, option B.

To determine who has the best standing to challenge the Secretary of Defense's decision to donate the plane to the church instead of the national organization, we must analyze the concept of standing. Standing requires a concrete and particularized injury, causation (the injury must be traceable to the challenged action), and redressability (a favorable court decision must be able to remedy the injury).

- **Option A**: The Secretary of Defense himself cannot challenge his own decision, so this option is invalid.  
- **Option B**: The national organization was initially planned to receive the plane but did not. They have a concrete injury—the loss of the plane—and can argue that the Secretary's decision was not in line with the statutory purpose. This gives them standing.  
- **Option C**: A federal court does not have standing; standing is about who can bring a case to the court, not the court itself.  
- **Option D**: A taxpayer generally lacks standing to challenge federal expenditures unless there is a constitutional violation, such as under the Establishment Clause. Here, the issue is statutory, so a taxpayer likely does not have standing.  
- **Option E**: A member of the church benefits from the decision and does not have an injury to challenge it.  
- **Option F**: A member of Congress might argue that the Secretary's action violates legislative prerogatives, but individual members of Congress often lack standing unless their institutional powers are directly affected. This makes standing less clear compared to the national organization.  
- **Option G**: Any resident in the United States lacks a particularized injury and cannot establish standing.  
- **Option H**: A citizen of the United States, like a resident, cannot establish standing based on citizenship alone without a specific injury.  
- **Option I**: A foreign government would need to show a direct injury, which is unlikely in this case.  
- **Option J**: A state within the United States would need to demonstrate a specific impact on its interests, which is not indicated here.  

The national organization (Option B) has the clearest and most direct standing because it suffered a concrete injury—the loss of the plane—and can challenge the Secretary's decision as inconsistent with the statutory purpose. 

Answer: B
