Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about net ionic equations. Hmm, I remember that net ionic equations show only the species that actually participate in the reaction, right? So the question is asking which pair of reactants will have no net ionic equation. That must mean that all the ions cancel out, so no reaction happens. I think that's when the reactants are all spectator ions, and no precipitation or gas is formed.

Let me look at the options. Each option is a pair of compounds. I need to figure out which pair doesn't react, meaning they don't form a precipitate, gas, or water. So I'll have to check the solubility rules for each.

Option A: Na2SO3 + FeCl2. Na2SO3 is sodium sulfite. Sodium is a group 1 metal, so its salts are usually soluble. FeCl2 is iron(II) chloride. Chlorides are generally soluble except for some metals like silver or lead. When they react, the possible products would be FeSO3 and NaCl. Wait, is FeSO3 soluble? I think sulfites are usually soluble with group 1 and some others, but I'm a bit fuzzy on FeSO3. I think iron(II) sulfite might be insoluble? Or maybe it's the other way around. Or maybe it's the opposite—I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should come back to this one.

Option B: MgBr2 + Na2CO3. MgBr2 is magnesium bromide, which is soluble because most bromides are. Na2CO3 is sodium carbonate, which is soluble as well. When they react, the products would be MgCO3 and NaBr. Now, magnesium carbonate—do I remember its solubility? Carbonates are usually insoluble except for group 1 and ammonium. So MgCO3 would precipitate out. That means a reaction happens, so this pair isn't the right answer.

Option C: NH4I + Pb(NO3)2. Ammonium iodide and lead nitrate. Both are soluble. Their products would be NH4NO3 and PbI2. NH4NO3 is definitely soluble because nitrates are always soluble, and ammonium salts too. Lead iodide, PbI2—lead is in group, I think, so iodides are usually soluble except for some like lead, mercury(I), and silver. So PbI2 is insoluble; it would precipitate. So reaction occurs, so not this pair.

Option D: NaOH + HCl. Both are strong acids and bases. When they react, they form NaCl and water. NaCl is soluble, so the net ionic equation would be H+ + OH- → H2O. So there is a net equation, so this isn't the answer.

Option E: BaCl2 + K2SO4. Barium chloride and potassium sulfate. Both are soluble. Products would be BaSO4 and KCl. BaSO4 is barium sulfate, which is famously insoluble. So it precipitates, so a reaction occurs. Not the answer.

Option F: Cu(NO3)2 + K2S. Copper nitrate and potassium sulfide. Both are soluble. Products would be CuS and KNO3. CuS is copper(II) sulfide. Sulfides are generally insoluble except for groups 1 and 2. So CuS would precipitate. Reaction happens, so not the right pair.

Option G: FeSO4 + NaCl. FeSO4 is iron(II) sulfate, which I think is soluble. NaCl is also soluble. Products would be FeCl2 and Na2SO4. Both FeCl2 and Na2SO4 are soluble. Wait, FeCl2 is soluble because chlorides are. Na2SO4 is sodium sulfate, which is soluble. So no precipitate, gas, or water formed. So all ions are spectators. So the net ionic equation would be nothing—meaning no reaction. So this could be the correct answer.

Option H: CaCl2 + MnSO4. Both are soluble. Products CaSO4 and MnCl2. CaSO4 is calcium sulfate, which I think is sparingly soluble but can precipitate under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe in high concentrations? Wait, I'm a bit unsure. Solubility rules: sulfates are usually soluble except for CaSO4 is slightly soluble. Oh wait, wait. Wait, calcium sulfate is considered only slightly soluble. So it might precipitate. So the net ionic equation would show CaSO4(s) forming. So a reaction happens here. So this isn't the right answer.

So reviewing, option G: FeSO4 + NaCl. The products are FeCl2 and Na2SO4. Both are soluble, so no precipitate. Hence, no net ionic equation. So the correct answer is G.

To determine which pair of reactants will have no net ionic equation, we need to identify a pair that does not produce a precipitate, gas, or water. This occurs when all ions in the reaction remain as spectator ions, meaning no reaction happens.

1. **Option A: Na₂SO₃ + FeCl₂**  
   Sodium sulfite (Na₂SO₃) and iron(II) chloride (FeCl₂) react to form iron(II) sulfite (FeSO₃) and sodium chloride (NaCl). FeSO₃ is likely insoluble, so a precipitate forms. This means a reaction occurs, and this pair is not the answer.

2. **Option B: MgBr₂ + Na₂CO₃**  
   Magnesium bromide (MgBr₂) and sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) react to form magnesium carbonate (MgCO₃) and sodium bromide (NaBr). MgCO₃ is insoluble and precipitates, so a reaction occurs. This pair is not the answer.

3. **Option C: NH₄I + Pb(NO₃)₂**  
   Ammonium iodide (NH₄I) and lead nitrate (Pb(NO₃)₂) react to form ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) and lead iodide (PbI₂). PbI₂ is insoluble and precipitates, so a reaction occurs. This pair is not the answer.

4. **Option D: NaOH + HCl**  
   Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) react to form sodium chloride (NaCl) and water (H₂O). Since water is produced, there is a net ionic equation (H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O). This pair is not the answer.

5. **Option E: BaCl₂ + K₂SO₄**  
   Barium chloride (BaCl₂) and potassium sulfate (K₂SO₄) react to form barium sulfate (BaSO₄) and potassium chloride (KCl). BaSO₄ is insoluble and precipitates, so a reaction occurs. This pair is not the answer.

6. **Option F: Cu(NO₃)₂ + K₂S**  
   Copper(II) nitrate (Cu(NO₃)₂) and potassium sulfide (K₂S) react to form copper(II) sulfide (CuS) and potassium nitrate (KNO₃). CuS is insoluble and precipitates, so a reaction occurs. This pair is not the answer.

7. **Option G: FeSO₄ + NaCl**  
   Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO₄) and sodium chloride (NaCl) react to form iron(II) chloride (FeCl₂) and sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄). Both FeCl₂ and Na₂SO₄ are soluble, so no precipitate or gas forms. All ions remain as spectator ions, resulting in no net ionic equation. This pair is the correct answer.

8. **Option H: CaCl₂ + MnSO₄**  
   Calcium chloride (CaCl₂) and manganese sulfate (MnSO₄) react to form calcium sulfate (CaSO₄) and manganese chloride (MnCl₂). CaSO₄ is sparingly soluble and can precipitate, so a reaction occurs. This pair is not the answer.

The correct answer is **G: FeSO₄ + NaCl**, as no reaction occurs and all ions remain as spectator ions. 

Answer: G
