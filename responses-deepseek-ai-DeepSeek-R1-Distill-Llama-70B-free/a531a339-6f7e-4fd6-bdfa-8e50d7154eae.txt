Okay, so I've got this math problem here about calculating the total cost for renting a truck. Let me read it carefully and figure out how to approach it.

The company is Armco Truck Rental Co. They have different charges:
- $32 per day
- $0.22 per mile
- $0.55 per gallon of gasoline
- Additional hours in a day are $2.75 per hour.

Mr. Williams rented the truck for 2 days and 3 hours. He drove 320 miles and used 30 gallons of gas. I need to find the total cost.

Hmm, let me break this down. I think I should calculate each part separately and then sum them up.

First, the daily charge. The rental is for 2 days, so that's straightforward. 2 days multiplied by $32 per day. So 2 * 32 = $64.

Next, the additional hours. Since he rented it for 2 days and 3 hours, the 3 hours are extra. The daily rate probably includes a certain number of hours, maybe 24? Or perhaps the 3 hours are beyond the two full days. So I should calculate the cost for those 3 hours. 3 hours * $2.75 per hour. Let me compute that: 3 * 2.75 is 8.25. So that's $8.25.

Now, the mileage. He drove 320 miles, and each mile costs $0.22. So 320 * 0.22. Let me calculate that. 320 * 0.2 is 64, and 320 * 0.02 is 6.4, so total is 70.4. So $70.40 for the miles.

Then the gasoline. He used 30 gallons at $0.55 per gallon. 30 * 0.55 is... let's see, 30 * 0.5 is 15, and 30 * 0.05 is 1.5, so total 16.5. So $16.50 for gas.

Now, add all these together: daily cost + additional hours + mileage + gasoline.

So $64 (daily) + $8.25 (hours) = $72.25. Then add $70.40 (mileage): 72.25 + 70.40 = $142.65. Then add the gasoline $16.50: 142.65 +16.50 = $159.15.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Daily: 2 days *32=64. Correct.

Additional hours: 3 *2.75=8.25. Correct.

Miles: 320*.22. Let me do 320 * 0.22 another way. 320 * 0.2 is 64, 320 *0.02 is 6.4, so 70.4. Correct.

Gas: 30 *0.55. 30 *0.5=15, 30 *0.05=1.5, so 16.5. Correct.

Adding up step by step:

64 +8.25=72.25.

72.25 +70.4=142.65.

142.65 +16.5=159.15.

Looking at the options, option J is $159.15. So the answer should be J.

The total cost is calculated by summing the charges for each component of the rental:

- **Daily charge**: 2 days × $32/day = $64  
- **Additional hours**: 3 hours × $2.75/hour = $8.25  
- **Mileage**: 320 miles × $0.22/mile = $70.40  
- **Gasoline**: 30 gallons × $0.55/gallon = $16.50  

Adding these together:  
$64 + $8.25 + $70.40 + $16.50 = $159.15  

The correct answer is **J: $159.15**.
