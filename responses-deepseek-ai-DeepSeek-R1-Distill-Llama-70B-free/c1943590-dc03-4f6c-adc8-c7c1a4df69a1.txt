The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

6.I-I. One characteristic of a car's storage console that is checked by the manufacturer is the time in seconds that it takes for the lower storage compartment door to open completely. A random sample of size $n=5$ yielded the following times:
$\begin{array}{lllll}1.1 & 0.9 & 1.4 & 1.1 & 1.0\end{array}$
(a) Find the sample mean, $\bar{x}$.

Options:

A: 1.6
B: 1.4
C: 1.5
D: 1.3
E: 0.8
F: 1.2
G: 1.0
H: 1.7
I: $1.1$ 
J: 0.9

Okay, so I have this statistics problem here about finding the sample mean of some data. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the sample mean is calculated by adding up all the values in the sample and then dividing by the number of values, which is the sample size. The problem gives me a sample size of n=5, so I'll need to add up the five numbers and then divide by 5.

Looking at the data provided: 1.1, 0.9, 1.4, 1.1, 1.0. Hmm, let me write them down to make adding easier.

So, 1.1 plus 0.9. Let me do that first. 1.1 + 0.9 is 2.0. Next, add 1.4 to that. 2.0 + 1.4 is 3.4. Then, adding the next 1.1 makes it 4.5. And finally, add 1.0, which brings the total to 5.5.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check that addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Adding them one by one:

1.1 + 0.9 = 2.0
2.0 + 1.4 = 3.4
3.4 + 1.1 = 4.5
4.5 + 1.0 = 5.5

Yes, that looks correct. So the sum is 5.5.

Now, since the sample size n is 5, I divide the sum by 5. So 5.5 divided by 5 equals... let me compute that. 5.5 divided by 5 is 1.1. Because 5 times 1 is 5, and 0.5 divided by 5 is 0.1, so 1 + 0.1 is 1.1.

So the sample mean, which is xÌ„, is 1.1. Now I need to look at the options to find which letter corresponds to 1.1. Let me check the options again.

Options are A:1.6, B:1.4, C:1.5, D:1.3, E:0.8, F:1.2, G:1.0, H:1.7, I:1.1, J:0.9.

So option I is 1.1. Therefore, the correct answer should be I.

To find the sample mean, we sum all the data points and divide by the sample size. The data provided is 1.1, 0.9, 1.4, 1.1, and 1.0. Adding these together gives:

1.1 + 0.9 = 2.0  
2.0 + 1.4 = 3.4  
3.4 + 1.1 = 4.5  
4.5 + 1.0 = 5.5  

The sum is 5.5, and the sample size \( n \) is 5. Dividing 5.5 by 5 yields a sample mean of 1.1. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**I: 1.1**
