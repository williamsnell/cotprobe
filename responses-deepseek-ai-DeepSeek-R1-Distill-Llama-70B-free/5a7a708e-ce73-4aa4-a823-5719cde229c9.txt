Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Nagel's view on the absolutist position. Hmm, I remember that Nagel has written about ethics, particularly in the context of moral luck and absolutism versus consequentialism. Let me think about what the core of absolutism is.

Absolutism in ethics usually refers to the belief that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of their consequences. So, for example, an absolutist might say that lying is always wrong, no matter the situation. This is different from consequentialism, which judges actions based on their outcomes—like utilitarianism, where the right action is the one that brings the greatest good.

The question asks what Nagel thinks is the core of the absolutist position. The options are A through J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: All actions are morally equivalent. That doesn't sound right. Absolutism isn't about equivalence; it's about certain actions being always wrong or right, so they aren't equivalent. So probably not A.

Option B: It is permissible to harm as a foreseen but unintended consequence of action. Wait, that sounds familiar. I think this relates to the doctrine of double effect, which is often discussed in absolutist or deontological ethics. The idea is that if an action has a bad consequence that's foreseen but not intended, it might be permissible. But is this the core of absolutism? Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's the central point Nagel is referring to.

Option C: The ends justify the means. No, that's more of a consequentialist view. Absolutists would argue that some means are inherently wrong, no matter the ends. So C is probably not correct.

Option D: Individuals should always act in their own best interest. That sounds like egoism, which isn't the same as absolutism. So D is out.

Option E: The moral worth of an action is determined by its outcome. Again, that's consequentialism, not absolutism. Absolutists care about the action itself, not the outcome. So E is wrong.

Option F: No action can be morally justified. That seems too extreme. Absolutism allows for some actions to be justified, just not based on outcomes. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Morality is subjective and varies from person to person. That’s moral relativism, which is different from absolutism. Absolutists believe in objective moral standards. So G is wrong.

Option H: The hostility should be directed at its true object. I'm not sure what this means in this context. Not sure, so I'll come back to it.

Option I: Human persons have a right to life. This sounds like a specific principle, perhaps related to the sanctity of life. But is this the core of absolutism? Maybe, but I'm not certain. I think absolutism is more about the structure of moral rules than specific rights, but I'm not sure.

Option J: Each person should pursue his or her own happiness. That's more like ethical egoism or perhaps hedonism, not absolutism. So J is incorrect.

Now, going back. Nagel's absolutism, I think, is more about the idea that certain actions are wrong regardless of consequences. So, the core is that some actions are absolutely prohibited. But which option aligns with that?

Wait, I recall that Nagel discussed the absolutist approach in the context of constraints on actions. So perhaps the core is that certain actions cannot be justified even if they lead to better outcomes. That would mean that the ends don't justify the means, which contradicts option C (which says ends do justify means). So C is not it.

Wait, but the question is about what Nagel thinks is the core. I think Nagel, in his work, might have discussed that absolutists believe that it's wrong to treat people as means to an end, which is more Kantian. But I'm not sure how that maps to the options.

Alternatively, I remember that in the context of the trolley problem and such, absolutists might say it's wrong to actively cause harm, even if it leads to a greater good. So perhaps that's related to option B, which talks about harming as a foreseen but unintended consequence. Because in the trolley problem, diverting the trolley leads to one death, which is an intended consequence, whereas if you remove a person from the tracks, maybe that's a different scenario.

Wait, no, option B says it's permissible to harm as a foreseen but unintended consequence. So that would be like the doctrine of double effect, where sometimes harming is allowed if it's not intended but foreseen. But is that the core of absolutism? I'm not entirely sure. The core might be more about the inherent wrongness of certain actions, regardless of intent.

Alternatively, I think the core of absolutism is the belief that certain actions are always wrong, such as killing innocent people. So perhaps option I, human persons have a right to life, is closer. Because if you have a right to life, then killing is absolutely wrong, except perhaps in self-defense, but even that might be debatable.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me try to think again. Nagel's absolutism... I think he argues that absolutists hold that there are certain constraints on action that cannot be overridden by considerations of overall good. So the core is about these constraints, like not killing, not lying, etc.

Looking back at the options, which one reflects that? Option I says human persons have a right to life, which would make killing them wrong. But is that the core, or just one application of it?

Alternatively, perhaps the core is more about the structure of moral rules, not specific rights. But looking at the options, perhaps the best fit is option I.

Wait, but another angle: the question might be pointing towards the idea that the absolutist position is that it's always wrong to kill, which would be option I. Alternatively, if the core is that the ends don't justify the means, but none of the options directly state that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option I. Because if human persons have a right to life, then it's absolutely wrong to kill them, which is a core tenet of absolutism. So I think I'll go with option I.

Nagel's absolutist position emphasizes that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of their consequences. This view is rooted in the belief that there are objective moral standards that cannot be overridden by considerations of overall good. Among the options provided, the core of absolutism aligns most closely with the idea that human persons have a right to life, making actions like killing inherently wrong. This principle reflects the absolutist belief in constraints on action that are not justified by outcomes.
