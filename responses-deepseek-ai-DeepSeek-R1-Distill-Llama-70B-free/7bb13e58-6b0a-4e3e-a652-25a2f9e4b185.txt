Question:

A woman duly executed a will under which she devised her farm to her nephew and bequeathed the residue of her estate to her niece. For 12 years after executing her will, the woman lived on her farm. Then she sold it and used the sales proceeds to purchase a home in the city, in which she lived until she died, never having changed her will. Following the admission of the will to probate, both the nephew and the niece claimed ownership of the home. There is no applicable statute. Who is the owner of the home?

Options:

A: The nephew, because of the doctrine of ademption.
B: The nephew, because of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.
C: The niece, because of the doctrine of lapse.
D: The niece, because she is the residuary legatee.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this wills and estates question. Let me read it carefully.

A woman made a will. She devised her farm to her nephew and left the rest of her estate (the residue) to her niece. So, the will says: farm to nephew, everything else to niece.

Then, for 12 years after making the will, she lived on the farm. Later, she sold the farm and used that money to buy a home in the city, where she lived until she died. She never changed her will after selling the farm.

Now, after her death, both the nephew and niece are claiming ownership of the home. The question is, who owns the home?

The options are from A to D. Let's think about the legal concepts here.

First, the will devises the farm to the nephew. So, the nephew was supposed to get the farm. But she sold the farm. What happens when a specific gift is sold by the testator before death? I remember something called ademption. Ademption occurs when a specific gift in a will is no longer in the estate at the time of death because the testator disposed of it during their lifetime. So, if the farm was sold, the specific gift to the nephew might adeem. That would mean the nephew doesn't get the farm because it's no longer there.

But then where does the money go from selling the farm? She used the proceeds to buy a home. So, the home was purchased with the money from the farm sale. Now, the home wasn't part of the original will, but the residue goes to the niece.

Wait, the residue is what's left after specific gifts. So, if the farm was a specific gift and it's adeemed, does that mean the residue includes the proceeds from the sale? Because the farm was a specific bequest, and she sold it, the proceeds would go into the residue. Because when she sold the farm, she converted it into money which was then used to buy the home. So, the home would be part of her estate at the time of her death.

But wait, the home is a new asset. So, when she died, she owned the home. Since she didn't update her will, the home would pass through the residue clause. The residue clause covers all the remaining property not otherwise disposed of. So, the niece, as the residuary legatee, should get the home.

Alternatively, could the nephew argue that the home was bought with the proceeds of the farm, which was his specific gift? I don't think so because once the specific gift (farm) is sold, the proceeds aren't tied to the specific gift anymore. Unless there's something like tracing or a resulting trust, but I don't think that applies in this case because the will didn't leave the proceeds to the nephew. The will only left the farm. Once it's sold, the proceeds go into the general estate.

So, the home, being purchased with those proceeds, is part of the residue. Therefore, the niece gets it as the residuary legatee.

Looking at the options:

A: Nephew because of ademption. Ademption applies to the farm, so nephew loses that. But the home isn't part of ademption; it's part of the residue.

B: Nephew via equitable estoppel. I don't think that applies here. Equitable estoppel is more about someone relying on a promise to their detriment. Not sure how that fits here.

C: Niece because of lapse. Lapse is when a beneficiary dies before the testator. Not applicable here.

D: Niece because she's the residuary legatee. That fits because the home is part of the residue.

So the correct answer should be D.

The woman's will devised the farm to her nephew and the residue of her estate to her niece. When the woman sold the farm, the specific gift to the nephew was adeemed because the asset no longer existed at her death. The proceeds from the sale were used to purchase a home in the city. Since the home was acquired after the will was made and was part of her estate at the time of her death, it falls under the residue clause of the will. As the residuary legatee, the niece is entitled to the home. 

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Ademption applies to the farm, but it does not affect the home, which is part of the residue.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Equitable estoppel does not apply here, as there is no evidence of reliance or detriment related to the home.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Lapse pertains to beneficiaries who predecease the testator, which is not the case here.  
- **Option D**: Correct. The home is part of the residue, and the niece, as the residuary legatee, inherits it.  

Answer: D
