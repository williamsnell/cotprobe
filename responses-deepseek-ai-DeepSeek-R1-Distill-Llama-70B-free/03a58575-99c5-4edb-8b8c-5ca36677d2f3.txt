Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of a square. The given points are (1,2) and (7,4), and they are opposite vertices of the square. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on coordinate geometry, but let's try to work through this.

First, I remember that in a square, all sides are equal and the diagonals are equal too. Oh wait, these two points are opposite vertices, so they must be the endpoints of a diagonal of the square. Right, so the diagonal connects these two points.

I think I should calculate the distance between these two points because that would give me the length of the diagonal. The distance formula is the square root of [(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2]. Let me plug in the values. 

So, x1 is 1, y1 is 2; x2 is 7, y2 is 4. 

Calculating the differences: (7-1) is 6, and (4-2) is 2. Then square those: 6 squared is 36, 2 squared is 4. Adding them gives 40. So the distance between the two points is the square root of 40, which simplifies to 2*sqrt(10). But wait, that's the diagonal, right?

Now, the area of the square can be found if I know the length of a side. I remember that the diagonal of a square is related to the side length by the formula diagonal = side * sqrt(2). So if the diagonal is 2*sqrt(10), then the side would be (2*sqrt(10)) / sqrt(2). Let me compute that. 

Dividing by sqrt(2) is the same as multiplying by sqrt(2)/2. So 2*sqrt(10) * sqrt(2)/2. The 2s cancel out, leaving sqrt(10)*sqrt(2) = sqrt(20). So the side length is sqrt(20). 

Wait, but the area is side squared. So (sqrt(20))^2 is 20. So the area should be 20. Let me see if that matches any of the options. Looking back, option B is 20. So that's probably the answer.

Alternatively, I remember another formula: the area of a square can also be found using the formula (diagonal^2)/2. Because if the diagonal is d, then area is (dÂ²)/2. Let me try that. 

The diagonal squared is (sqrt(40))^2, which is 40. So 40 divided by 2 is 20. Yep, same result. So the area is 20. That's option B.

I think I'm confident now. The answer should be B.

To determine the area of the square, we start by recognizing that the points \((1,2)\) and \((7,4)\) are opposite vertices, meaning they form the diagonal of the square. The length of the diagonal can be calculated using the distance formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

Substituting the given points \((1,2)\) and \((7,4)\):

\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(7-1)^2 + (4-2)^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{36 + 4} = \sqrt{40}
\]

The diagonal of the square is \(\sqrt{40}\). The area of a square can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{\text{Diagonal}^2}{2}
\]

Substituting \(\text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{40}\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{(\sqrt{40})^2}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Thus, the area of the square is 20, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
