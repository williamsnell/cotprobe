Okay, so I have this math problem here about the cost and selling price of a stock. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The cost was $4,200, and the selling price is 85% of the total cost. I need to find the selling price.

Hmm, alright. So the cost price is like the original price they paid for the stock, which is $4,200. The selling price is what they sold it for, which is 85% of that cost. I think I need to calculate 85% of $4,200.

Wait, how do I calculate percentages again? Oh right, to find a percentage of a number, I multiply the percentage (as a decimal) by that number. So 85% as a decimal is 0.85. So I should multiply 4,200 by 0.85.

Let me do the math. 4,200 times 0.85. Hmm, breaking that down. Maybe I can think of it as 4,200 * 0.8 plus 4,200 * 0.05.

Calculating 4,200 * 0.8: 0.8 is the same as 8/10, so 4,200 * 8 = 33,600, then divide by 10 gives 3,360.

Then 4,200 * 0.05: 0.05 is 5%, which is like dividing by 20. So 4,200 divided by 20 is 210.

Adding those two together: 3,360 + 210 = 3,570. So the selling price should be $3,570.

Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches. Let me check the options:

Option A: $3,780 - that's higher than what I got.
Option B: $3,990 - way higher, nope.
Option C: $3,150 - lower than mine.
Option D: $3,400 - still lower.
Option E: $4,500 - way too high.
Option F: $3,675 - close but not my number.
Option G: $3,800 - higher.
Option H: $3,570 - that's exactly what I calculated.
Option I: $4,200 - that's the cost, not the selling price.
Option J: $3,915 - also doesn't match.

So the correct answer should be option H.

To determine the selling price of the stock when it's 85% of the total cost, we calculate 85% of $4,200. 

1. Convert 85% to a decimal: 0.85.
2. Multiply $4,200 by 0.85:  
   \[
   4,200 \times 0.85 = 3,570
   \]

The selling price is $3,570, which corresponds to option H.
