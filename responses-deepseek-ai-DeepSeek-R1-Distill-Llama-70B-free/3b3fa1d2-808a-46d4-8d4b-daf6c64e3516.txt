Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Peter Singer's theory and an objection to it. I'm not super familiar with Singer's work, but I remember he's a utilitarian philosopher, right? His ideas often revolve around ethics and how we should act to maximize well-being.

The question is asking about an objection that Singer himself considers. The options are A through J, each pointing out a different possible flaw in his theory. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I'll try to recall Singer's main arguments. I think he's known for his "drowning child" analogy, where he argues that if you can save a child drowning in a pond with minimal effort, you should. He extends this to global poverty, suggesting that people in affluent countries should help those in poorer ones because the suffering is just as real, even if it's far away.

Wait, one of the objections I remember is about proximity. Some people argue that being physically close to someone in need makes a difference in our moral obligations. Singer, on the other hand, says that proximity shouldn't matter morally; if you can help someone in need, regardless of where they are, you should. So an objection to his theory might be that it makes proximity important inappropriately. No, wait, actually, Singer argues against considering proximity. So maybe the objection is that his theory doesn't account for proximity, but the question says it's an objection he considers, meaning someone else's objection to his theory.

Wait, the question says "One objection to Singer’s theory that he considers is that it:" So Singer must have addressed this objection in his work.

Let me think again. One common criticism is that his theory requires too much from individuals, possibly leading to a drastic change in how we live our lives. For example, some argue that if we take his ideas to the extreme, people would have to give away most of their income, which is a huge change. So the objection could be that his theory requires too drastic a revision of our moral framework.

Looking at the options, option J says: "requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme." That sounds familiar because I remember Singer's ideas being quite radical and challenging conventional moral norms. He does argue that we should give a significant portion of our income to help others, which many find too demanding.

Another possible objection is about our obligations to loved ones versus strangers. Some argue that we have stronger obligations to family and friends. Singer might respond by saying that if a stranger's need is greater, our obligation is stronger, but I'm not sure if that's the main objection considered.

Option E says: "does not account for the fact that we have stricter obligations to our loved ones than to strangers." But I think Singer actually addresses this by arguing that the strength of the obligation depends on the situation, not the relationship. So maybe that's an objection he considers.

Wait, but the question is about an objection he considers. So he must have discussed these points in his work. I think he does address the issue of proximity (option A) by arguing against it. But the question is about an objection to his theory, so someone else's point against him.

Wait, the wording is "an objection to Singer’s theory that he considers." So it's an objection raised by others that Singer himself acknowledges or responds to.

Let me think about what Singer's critics say. One major criticism is that his utilitarian approach demands too much from individuals. It could lead people to a life of extreme self-sacrifice, which is seen as unrealistic or too demanding. Therefore, option J could be the correct answer.

Alternatively, another objection is that his theory doesn't account for our special obligations to friends and family. So option E might be another possibility. But I'm not sure which one Singer specifically considers.

Wait, in his book "The Life You Can Save," Singer discusses various objections. One of them is the idea that people have stronger obligations to those close to them. He argues against this, saying that the moral importance shouldn't be based on proximity but on the ability to help. So option E is about not accounting for stricter obligations to loved ones, which is an objection he considers.

But then, option J is about requiring a drastic revision. I'm a bit torn between E and J.

Wait, the question is phrased as "One objection to Singer’s theory that he considers is that it:" So Singer's theory is being criticized for something, and he addresses that criticism.

I think the main objection is that his theory is too demanding, requiring a drastic change in our moral lives, which is option J. Because that's a common criticism of utilitarianism in general and Singer's specific application of it.

So I'll go with option J.

The question asks about an objection to Peter Singer’s theory that he himself considers. Singer, a utilitarian philosopher, argues that individuals have a moral obligation to help those in need, regardless of proximity, and that this obligation extends globally. However, his theory has faced several criticisms. One major objection is that his approach requires a drastic revision to our existing moral framework, as it demands significant sacrifices from individuals, such as giving away a large portion of their income to alleviate global suffering. This criticism highlights the perceived extremity of Singer’s proposals and their potential to disrupt conventional moral norms.

While other objections, such as the importance of proximity (option A) or stricter obligations to loved ones (option E), are also relevant, the most prominent criticism Singer addresses is the radical nature of his moral demands. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J: requires too drastic a revision to our moral scheme.

Answer: J
