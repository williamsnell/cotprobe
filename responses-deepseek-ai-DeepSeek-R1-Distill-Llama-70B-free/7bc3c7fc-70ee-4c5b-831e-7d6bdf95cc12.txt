Question:

What was the importance of peace research during the 1980s?

Options:

A: Peace research was inter-disciplinary and politically orientated with immediate policy responsibility accountable to the major powers of the political system.
B: There was a distance from policy responsibility but European security studies gained political relevance due to the politicization of security issues during the period defined by the peace movement.
C: The importance of peace research was largely due to its focus on economic stability, rather than political or military issues.
D: The setting was simultaneously informed by political theory as the dominant discipline and isolated from developments in theory in the different disciplines.
E: Peace research was not relevant during the 1980s due to the lack of major conflicts.
F: Peace research was primarily used for the development of military strategies during the period of the Cold War.
G: There was an increased focus on peace research due to the rise in global terrorism.
H: The importance of peace research was diminished as it was seen as too theoretical and not applicable to real-world situations.

Okay, so I have this question about peace research during the 1980s, and I need to figure out the correct answer from the options given. Let me start by recalling what I know about peace research and its context in the 80s.

First, I remember that the 1980s were a significant time during the Cold War. There were heightened tensions between the US and the Soviet Union, with events like the deployment of Euromissiles and the rise of anti-nuclear movements. Peace movements were pretty active then, like the Nuclear Freeze movement in the US and similar groups in Europe. So, peace research probably had some connection to these movements.

Looking at the options:

Option A says peace research was inter-disciplinary and politically oriented with immediate policy responsibility. That sounds a bit off because I think peace research in that era wasn't directly tied to policy-making. It might have influenced policy indirectly, but the researchers weren't holding policy positions.

Option B mentions a distance from policy responsibility but notes that European security studies became politically relevant because of the politicization of security issues, especially due to the peace movement. That makes sense because the peace movement was a big deal, and while researchers might not have been in policy roles, their work would have been influenced by and relevant to the political climate.

Option C focuses on economic stability, which I don't recall being the main focus. Peace research was more about conflict, disarmament, and security issues rather than purely economic.

Option D says it was informed by political theory but isolated from other disciplines. I think the opposite is true. Peace research is usually interdisciplinary, combining political science, sociology, economics, etc. So D doesn't seem right.

Option E claims peace research wasn't relevant because there were no major conflicts. That's not accurate. The Cold War was ongoing, and there were plenty of proxy wars and tensions, so peace research was definitely relevant.

Option F says it was used for military strategies. No, peace research is about preventing conflict, not developing military strategies. That's more of a defense or military studies focus.

Option G talks about global terrorism. While terrorism existed, the 80s were more about state-based conflicts and the Cold War. I don't think terrorism was the main driver for peace research then.

Option H says it was too theoretical. I don't think that's the case. Peace research often aimed to have practical applications, especially in areas like arms control and conflict resolution.

So, putting it together, B seems the most accurate. Peace researchers weren't directly involved in policy (distance from policy responsibility), but their work became more relevant because of the political climate and the peace movement's influence on security issues.

The importance of peace research during the 1980s can be understood in the context of the Cold War and the rise of the peace movement. Peace research was not directly tied to policy-making but gained relevance due to the politicization of security issues, particularly influenced by the peace movement. This focus on security and disarmament made the research politically significant, even though it remained somewhat removed from direct policy responsibility.

B: There was a distance from policy responsibility but European security studies gained political relevance due to the politicization of security issues during the period defined by the peace movement.

Answer: B
