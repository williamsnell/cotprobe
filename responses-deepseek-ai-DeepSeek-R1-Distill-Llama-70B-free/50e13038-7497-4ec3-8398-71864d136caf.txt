Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about calculating the change in entropy (ΔS) for a diatomic gas undergoing a reversible adiabatic compression. Hmm, right. I remember that in an adiabatic process, no heat is exchanged with the surroundings (Q=0). So the first law of thermodynamics, ΔU = Q + W, would simplify to ΔU = W, meaning the work done on the system changes its internal energy.

Wait, but the question is about entropy change. Oh right, entropy is a state function, so the change only depends on the initial and final states, not the path. That's helpful.

So the gas is diatomic. I think diatomic gases have different heat capacities compared to monoatomic gases. Oh yeah, for diatomic gases, the molar heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) is higher because they have more degrees of freedom. The problem gives Cv as 27.5 J/K/mol. Right, for diatomic gases, I remember that at room temperature, Cv is about (5/2)R, which is around 20.8 J/K/mol, but wait, wait, wait! Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K. So (5/2)R would be 5/2 * 8.314 ≈ 20.785 J/mol·K. But wait, the given Cv is 27.5 J/K/mol. That's higher than 20.8. Hmm. Maybe this is at higher temperatures where vibrational modes are active? Because at high temps, diatomic gases have more degrees of freedom, so Cv increases. So maybe that's why it's 27.5 here.

But wait, the problem states that the gas is diatomic, but the Cv is given, so maybe I don't need to worry about whether it's 5/2 R or 7/2 R. I'll just use the given value.

The process is reversible and adiabatic. For such processes, I remember that the entropy change ΔS is zero. Wait, why is that? Because in a reversible adiabatic process, it's also isentropic. So the entropy doesn't change. Because for a reversible process, the entropy change of the system is equal to the heat transferred divided by the temperature, but since it's adiabatic, Q=0, so dS = 0.

Wait no, wait. Let me think again. The formula for entropy change when heat is transferred reversibly is dS = (dQ_rev)/T. In an adiabatic process, dQ_rev is zero because no heat is exchanged. So the integral of dS would be zero. So for the system, the entropy change is zero. But wait, that's only for a reversible adiabatic process. So in this case, since the process is reversible and adiabatic, the entropy change of the system (the gas) should be zero.

So if the process is reversible and adiabatic, then ΔS = 0.

Wait, but wait. Let's make sure. The process is reversible and adiabatic. So the gas is compressed, and its temperature increases from 200 K to 250 K. But regardless of the process details, if it's reversible and adiabatic, the entropy change is zero. So regardless of the initial and final states, the entropy change of the system is zero.

So the answer should be E: 0.

Wait, but another thought: Am I considering the system and surroundings correctly? In an adiabatic process, it's the system that doesn't exchange heat with the surroundings. But the process being reversible and adiabatic implies that the entropy change of the system plus surroundings is zero? Or just the system's?

Wait, for the system, the entropy change is zero because it's a reversible adiabatic process. For the surroundings, since the process is reversible, any heat expelled (if any) would cause an equal but opposite entropy change, but since Q=0 for adiabatic, both system and surroundings have ΔS=0. But in this case, the question is only about the system's entropy change.

So the answer is E: 0.

But wait, just to make sure I'm not missing any other factors. The problem gives moles, initial temperature, and final temperature. But if the process is reversible and adiabatic, those details about the temperature change shouldn't affect the entropy change of the system, because the process is isentropic.

So yeah, I'm confident the correct answer is E: 0.

In this problem, we are tasked with calculating the change in entropy (ΔS) for a diatomic gas undergoing a reversible and adiabatic compression. The key points to consider are:

1. **Adiabatic Process**: By definition, no heat is exchanged with the surroundings (Q = 0). For such processes, the first law of thermodynamics simplifies to ΔU = W, where the work done on the system changes its internal energy.

2. **Reversible Process**: In a reversible process, the entropy change of the system is given by:

   \[
   \Delta S = \int \frac{dQ_{\text{rev}}}{T}
   \]

   Since the process is adiabatic (Q = 0), the integral becomes zero, and thus the entropy change of the system is:

   \[
   \Delta S = 0
   \]

3. **State Function**: Entropy is a state function, meaning its change depends only on the initial and final states of the system, not on the path taken. For a reversible adiabatic process, the system's entropy change is always zero, regardless of the temperature change or the number of moles.

4. **Given Data**: Although the problem provides details such as the number of moles, initial and final temperatures, and the molar heat capacity at constant volume (\(C_{V,m}\)), these are not relevant for calculating the entropy change in this specific case. The key fact is that the process is both reversible and adiabatic.

Thus, the entropy change of the gas during this process is:

\[
\Delta S = 0
\]

The correct answer is:

E: 0
