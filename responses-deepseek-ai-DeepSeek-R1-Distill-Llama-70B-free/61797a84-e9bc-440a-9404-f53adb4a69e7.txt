Okay, so I have this physics question about the rotation of a solid disk. Hmm, I remember that when something rotates, different points on it have different speeds based on their distance from the axis. Let me think.

The question is asking what's true about the rotation. The options are A to J. I'll go through them one by one.

Option A says the part further from the axis rotates more slowly. Wait, I thought that the farther out you go, the higher the speed because the circumference is larger. So if angular velocity is the same (omega), then v = r * omega. So a larger r means higher v. So A is probably incorrect because it's saying the opposite.

Option B: The part further from the axis has a shorter period. Period T is the time to complete one rotation. Since period is related to angular velocity by T = 2π/ω. If ω is the same everywhere on the disk (because it's a rigid body rotating), then T is the same for all points. So B is wrong because it says period is shorter when further, but if T is same everywhere, then B is false.

Option C: The period is different on every point. No, because the whole disk rotates together, so all points have the same period. So C is wrong.

Option D: Closer to axis has longer period. No, because period is same for all points. So D is wrong.

Option E: Closer has shorter period. No, same reasoning, period is same. So E is wrong.

Option F: The period is same everywhere. Yes, this makes sense because the disk is solid and all parts turn together. So F is correct. But let me check the other options to be sure.

Option G: Velocity same everywhere. No, because velocity depends on radius. v = rω. So farther out, higher v. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Further from axis has longer period. No, the period is same. So H is wrong.

Option I: Closer part rotates more rapidly. Wait, I thought that the angular velocity is same, but tangential speed is higher when further out. So when they say 'rotates more rapidly,' maybe they're talking about angular velocity? Oh wait, no, because in rotation, every point has the same angular velocity. So I is talking about rotating more rapidly, which would imply higher angular velocity, but that's not true because omega is same. Wait, no, maybe 'rotates more rapidly' refers to tangential speed. So the closer parts have lower speed, further have higher. So I says closer parts rotate more rapidly—no, that's wrong. Because when closer, the speed is lower, not higher. So I is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be F. Because all points on the disk have the same period, since they complete each rotation together. So F is correct.

The rotation of a solid disk involves the relationship between angular velocity, tangential speed, and the period of rotation. For a rigidly rotating disk, all points share the same angular velocity (ω) and the same period (T), as the entire disk completes one full rotation simultaneously. The tangential speed (v), however, varies with the distance from the axis of rotation, following the equation \( v = r \omega \). This means that points farther from the axis have a higher tangential speed, while points closer to the axis have a lower tangential speed.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The part farther from the axis does not rotate more slowly; it has a higher tangential speed.
- **B**: Incorrect. The period is the same for all points on the disk, so the part farther from the axis does not have a shorter period.
- **C**: Incorrect. The period is the same for all points on the disk, as it is a rigid body.
- **D**: Incorrect. The part closer to the axis does not have a longer period; the period is uniform across the disk.
- **E**: Incorrect. The part closer to the axis does not have a shorter period; the period is the same everywhere.
- **F**: Correct. The period of rotation is the same for all points on the disk.
- **G**: Incorrect. The velocity is not the same everywhere; tangential speed increases with distance from the axis.
- **H**: Incorrect. The part farther from the axis does not have a longer period; the period is uniform.
- **I**: Incorrect. The part closer to the axis does not rotate more rapidly; angular velocity is the same everywhere, but tangential speed is lower closer to the axis.

Thus, the correct answer is **F**, as the period of rotation is the same for all points on the disk.
