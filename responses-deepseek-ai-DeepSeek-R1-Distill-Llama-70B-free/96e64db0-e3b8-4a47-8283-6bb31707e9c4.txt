Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm supposed to translate the sentence "All birds live in some nest" into predicate logic. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the sentence. "All birds live in some nest." So it's saying that for every bird, there exists at least one nest where that bird lives. That makes sense. So each bird has its own nest, or maybe they share, but each has at least one.

Now, the predicates are given:
- Bx: x is a bird
- Nx: x is a nest
- Lxy: x lives in y

I think the structure here is a universal statement because it's saying "all birds." So I'm expecting a universal quantifier at the beginning, like ∀x. 

The sentence can be rephrased as: For every x, if x is a bird, then there exists a y such that y is a nest and x lives in y. So in logical terms, it's ∀x (Bx → ∃y (Ny ∧ Lxy)).

Let me look at the options to see which matches this structure.

Option A: (∃x)[Bx ⊃ (∃y)(Ny • Lxy)]
Hmm, this starts with an existential quantifier, which doesn't fit because we're talking about all birds, not just some.

Option B: (∀x)[(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy]
Wait, this seems off. The antecedent is Bx and Ny, but y isn't quantified here. Also, the implication would be that if x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y. But that's not correct because not every bird lives in every nest. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: (∀x)(∃y)[(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy]
Here, for every x, there's a y, but the implication is if x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y. But that still doesn't capture that the y depends on x. Also, if x isn't a bird, the implication is true regardless, which might not be an issue, but I'm not sure if this is the best fit.

Option D: (∃x)(∀y)[(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy]
This has an existential x and universal y. Doesn't make sense because the original statement isn't about some bird and all nests.

Option E: (∀x)(∃y)[(Bx ⊃ Ny) • Lxy]
This says for every x, there's a y where if x is a bird, then y is a nest, and x lives in y. Wait, that would mean that for all x, there's a y such that (if x is a bird, y is a nest) and x lives in y. But that's not exactly right because the "Ny" is outside the implication. So actually, it's (Bx → Ny) and Lxy. That might not capture the correct nesting because it's saying that either x isn't a bird, or y is a nest, and x lives in y. I'm not sure if that's correct.

Option F: (∀x)[(∃y)(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy]
This seems a bit tangled. It's saying for all x, if there exists a y such that x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y. But that's not quite right because the existence of y where x is a bird and y is a nest would always be true for birds, and then x must live in y. But I'm not sure if this correctly captures the 'some nest' part.

Option G: (∀x)(∀y)[(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy]
This is a universal statement over both x and y. So for all x and y, if x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y. That would mean every bird lives in every nest, which is definitely not what the original statement says. So G is incorrect.

Option H: (∀x)[(∃y)(Ny • Bx) ⊃ Lxy]
This says for every x, if there's a y that's a nest and x is a bird, then x lives in y. Wait, that might not be right. The antecedent is that there exists a nest where x is a bird, which is a bit odd. Because Bx is about x being a bird, and Ny is y being a nest. So the antecedent would be true if x is a bird and there's any nest, which is always true if there's at least one nest. Then it would imply x lives in y, but y is bound by the existential, so I'm not sure. This seems a bit off.

Option I: (∀x)[Bx ⊃ (∃y)(Ny • Lxy)]
This looks promising. For every x, if x is a bird, then there exists a y such that y is a nest and x lives in y. That's exactly what I thought the structure should be. So this seems correct.

Option J: (∀x)[Bx ⊃ (∀y)(Ny • Lxy)]
This says for every x, if x is a bird, then for all y, if y is a nest, then x lives in y. That would mean every bird lives in every nest, which is way too strong and not what the original statement says.

So reviewing, the correct structure is ∀x (Bx → ∃y (Ny ∧ Lxy)), which is option I.

The sentence "All birds live in some nest" can be translated into predicate logic as follows: For every x, if x is a bird, then there exists a y such that y is a nest and x lives in y. This is expressed logically as:

**∀x (Bx → ∃y (Ny ∧ Lxy))**

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: (∃x)[Bx ⊃ (∃y)(Ny • Lxy)]  
  This uses an existential quantifier for x, which is incorrect because the statement is about all birds, not some.

- **Option B**: (∀x)[(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy]  
  This implies that if x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y. However, y is not quantified, and this does not capture the "some nest" part.

- **Option C**: (∀x)(∃y)[(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy]  
  This suggests that for every x, there exists a y such that if x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y. However, the structure is not optimal because it does not clearly convey that the nest depends on the bird.

- **Option D**: (∃x)(∀y)[(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy]  
  This uses an existential quantifier for x and a universal quantifier for y, which does not match the original statement.

- **Option E**: (∀x)(∃y)[(Bx ⊃ Ny) • Lxy]  
  This suggests that for every x, there exists a y such that if x is a bird, then y is a nest, and x lives in y. However, the structure is unclear and does not fully capture the intended meaning.

- **Option F**: (∀x)[(∃y)(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy]  
  This implies that for every x, if there exists a y such that x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y. This is not the correct way to express the original statement.

- **Option G**: (∀x)(∀y)[(Bx • Ny) ⊃ Lxy]  
  This suggests that for all x and y, if x is a bird and y is a nest, then x lives in y. This would mean every bird lives in every nest, which is incorrect.

- **Option H**: (∀x)[(∃y)(Ny • Bx) ⊃ Lxy]  
  This implies that for every x, if there exists a y such that y is a nest and x is a bird, then x lives in y. This is not the correct way to express the original statement.

- **Option I**: (∀x)[Bx ⊃ (∃y)(Ny • Lxy)]  
  This matches the correct structure: For every x, if x is a bird, then there exists a y such that y is a nest and x lives in y.

- **Option J**: (∀x)[Bx ⊃ (∀y)(Ny • Lxy)]  
  This suggests that for every x, if x is a bird, then for all y, if y is a nest, then x lives in y. This would mean every bird lives in every nest, which is incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option I**, as it accurately captures the meaning of the original statement.

**Answer: I**
