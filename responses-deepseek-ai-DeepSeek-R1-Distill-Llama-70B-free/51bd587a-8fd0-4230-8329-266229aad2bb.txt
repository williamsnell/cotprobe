Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about missing mass in a fluorine isotope. Hmm, let's see what I remember from chemistry. I think missing mass has something to do with mass defect, right? Oh wait, mass defect is the difference between the mass of the nucleus and the sum of the masses of its individual protons, neutrons, and electrons. Or wait, no, maybe it's just the sum of the protons and neutrons before they form the nucleus. Because when nucleons bind together, some mass is converted into energy, which is the binding energy. So the mass of the atom is less than the sum of the individual particles, and that difference is the mass defect.

The problem gives me the atomic weight of ^19_9F as 18.9984 amu. I need to find the missing mass. So I guess I should calculate the expected mass if all the protons, neutrons, and electrons were separate, and then subtract the actual atomic mass. The difference would be the missing mass.

Wait, but how do I get the expected mass? Let me think. The atomic number is 9, so that's the number of protons and electrons. The mass number is 19, which is protons plus neutrons. So protons = 9, neutrons = 19-9 = 10.

So the expected mass should be the sum of the masses of 9 protons, 10 neutrons, and 9 electrons. Because for an atom, the electrons are part of the atomic mass. Wait, but sometimes when we talk about mass defect, we only consider the nucleus, but in this problem, the atomic weight includes electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

The given atomic weight is 18.9984 amu. The atomic weight includes the masses of protons, neutrons, and electrons. So to find the expected mass, I need to sum the masses of all the individual particles before they combine into the atom.

So the steps are:

1. Calculate the total mass of protons: 9 protons * mass of a proton.
2. Calculate the total mass of neutrons: 10 neutrons * mass of a neutron.
3. Calculate the total mass of electrons: 9 electrons * mass of an electron.
4. Sum all these to get the expected mass.
5. Subtract the actual atomic mass from this expected mass. The result is the missing mass (mass defect).

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. Because when you form an atom, you have the nucleus plus the electrons. The binding energy comes from the nucleus formation, which is the mass defect of the nucleus. But when considering the atomic mass, the electrons are part of it. Hmm, maybe I should be careful here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass defect is calculated as (sum of masses of protons and neutrons) minus (mass of nucleus). But the atomic mass includes the electrons. So maybe I should think about the mass of the nucleus itself.

Wait, maybe I should break it down.

The atomic mass (given) is the mass of the entire atom, including electrons. So the mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Because the atomic mass is the mass of the atom, which includes the nucleus plus the electrons. So the nucleus's mass is atomic_mass - (mass of electrons). But when calculating the mass defect, it's the mass of the separated nucleons (protons and neutrons) minus the mass of the nucleus. Because the electrons are part of the atom but not part of the nucleus.

So the mass defect would be calculated as (sum of protons and neutrons masses) minus (mass of nucleus). But the mass of the nucleus is (atomic mass) minus (mass of electrons). So putting it together:

Mass_defect = [ (protons * m_p) + (neutrons * m_n) ] - [ atomic_mass - (electrons * m_e) ]

Wait, that might not be right. Let me try to clarify.

Another approach: The mass of the atom is equal to the mass of the nucleus plus the mass of the electrons. So,

atomic_mass = mass_nucleus + (Z * m_e)

So, solving for mass_nucleus:

mass_nucleus = atomic_mass - (Z * m_e)

Then, the mass defect is the sum of the masses of the individual protons and neutrons minus the mass of the nucleus:

mass_defect = (Z * m_p + N * m_n) - mass_nucleus

Substituting mass_nucleus:

mass_defect = (Z * m_p + N * m_n) - (atomic_mass - Z * m_e )

So that's the formula. Let's plug in the numbers.

Given:

Z = 9 (since it's fluorine, atomic number 9)
N = 19 - 9 = 10
m_p = 1.00728 amu
m_n = 1.00867 amu
m_e = 0.000549 amu
atomic_mass = 18.9984 amu

So:

mass_defect = (9 * 1.00728 + 10 * 1.00867) - (18.9984 - 9 * 0.000549)

Wait, let's compute each part step by step.

First, calculate the sum of protons and neutrons:

9 * 1.00728 = let's compute that.

1.00728 *9:

1.00728 * 9 = 9.06552 amu

Similarly, 10 * 1.00867 = 10.0867 amu

Adding those: 9.06552 + 10.0867 = 19.15222 amu

Next, calculate the mass of the nucleus, which is atomic_mass minus electrons.

atomic_mass = 18.9984 amu

electrons mass = 9 * 0.000549 = let's compute that.

0.000549 * 9 = 0.004941 amu

So mass_nucleus = 18.9984 - 0.004941 = 18.993459 amu

Now, mass_defect is sum of protons and neutrons minus mass_nucleus.

So mass_defect = 19.15222 - 18.993459 = ?

19.15222 - 18.993459 = 

Let me subtract:

19.152220
-18.993459
= ?

Subtract digit by digit.

19.152220
-18.993459
= 0.158761 amu

Wait, that gives me approximately 0.158761 amu.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.1588 amu, which is very close to this value. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations.

Sum of protons: 9 *1.00728 = 9.06552

Sum of neutrons: 10 *1.00867 =10.0867

Total: 19.15222

Electrons:9 *0.000549=0.004941

mass_nucleus=18.9984 -0.004941=18.993459

Mass defect =19.15222 -18.993459=0.158761, which is approximately 0.1588 amu.

Yes, that matches option H.

To determine the missing mass (mass defect) in ^19_9F, we calculate the difference between the expected mass of the individual protons, neutrons, and electrons and the actual atomic mass of the atom. The atomic weight of ^19_9F is given as 18.9984 amu. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Number of protons (Z), neutrons (N), and electrons**:  
   - Atomic number \( Z = 9 \) (protons and electrons).  
   - Mass number \( A = 19 \), so \( N = A - Z = 10 \) (neutrons).  

2. **Mass contributions**:  
   - Mass of protons: \( 9 \times 1.00728 = 9.06552 \, \text{amu} \).  
   - Mass of neutrons: \( 10 \times 1.00867 = 10.0867 \, \text{amu} \).  
   - Mass of electrons: \( 9 \times 0.000549 = 0.004941 \, \text{amu} \).  

3. **Expected mass of the atom**:  
   The expected mass is the sum of the masses of protons, neutrons, and electrons:  
   \[
   \text{Expected mass} = 9.06552 + 10.0867 + 0.004941 = 19.157161 \, \text{amu}.
   \]

4. **Mass of the nucleus**:  
   The atomic mass includes the electrons, so the mass of the nucleus is:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of nucleus} = \text{Atomic mass} - \text{Mass of electrons} = 18.9984 - 0.004941 = 18.993459 \, \text{amu}.
   \]

5. **Mass defect**:  
   The mass defect is the difference between the expected mass of the nucleons (protons and neutrons) and the actual mass of the nucleus:  
   \[
   \text{Mass defect} = (9.06552 + 10.0867) - 18.993459 = 19.15222 - 18.993459 = 0.158761 \, \text{amu}.
   \]

6. **Final result**:  
   The calculated mass defect is approximately \( 0.1588 \, \text{amu} \), which matches option **H**.
