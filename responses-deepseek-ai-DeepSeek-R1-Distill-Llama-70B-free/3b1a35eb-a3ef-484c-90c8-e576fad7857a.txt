Okay, so I have this physics problem about light refraction. Hmm, I remember that when light travels from one medium to another, it bends, and the angle it bends depends on the refractive indices of the two materials. Let me think. Oh right, Snell's Law is the key here. Snell's Law formula is n1 * sin(theta1) = n2 * sin(theta2). 

The problem says light is going from water to diamond. Water has a refractive index of 1.33 and diamond is 2.42. The angle of incidence, theta1, is 13 degrees. Wait, wait, wait—wait, when light goes from a lower refractive index to a higher one, it bends towards the normal, right? So the angle of refraction (theta2) should be smaller than the angle of incidence. 

So plugging in the numbers. n1 is 1.33, theta1 is 13 degrees. n2 is 2.42. So the equation is 1.33 * sin(13) = 2.42 * sin(theta2). I need to solve for theta2. 

Let me calculate sin(13 degrees) first. I don't have a calculator, but I remember that sin(10) is about 0.1736, sin(15) is roughly 0.2588. So sin(13) should be somewhere in between. Let's say approximately 0.2249. Wait, I think I can get a better estimate. Maybe using a calculator would be more accurate, but since I don't have one, I'll proceed with approximate values.

So 1.33 * 0.2249 is approximately 0.298. Then, 2.42 * sin(theta2) equals 0.298. So sin(theta2) = 0.298 / 2.42. Let me compute that. 0.298 divided by 2.42. Hmm, 2.42 times 0.123 is about 0.298, because 2.42 * 0.1 is 0.242, 0.02 is 0.0484, so 0.122 is 0.242 + (0.02*2.42)=0.0484 → 0.2904. That's close to 0.298. So sin(theta2) ≈ 0.123.

Now, what angle has a sine of approximately 0.123? Let's think. Sin(7 degrees) is about 0.1218, and sin(7.1) maybe around 0.1235. So theta2 is around 7.1 degrees. Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 7.1, which is an option. But wait, wait, another thought: when I calculated sin(13) as 0.2249, is that accurate? Because if I miscalculated, that would throw everything off.

Wait, let me try to get a more precise value for sin(13 degrees). Using a calculator method: 13 degrees in radians is about 0.2269 radians. The Taylor series for sin(x) around 0 is x - x^3/6 + x^5/120, etc. So x=0.2269, x^3 is approx (0.2269)^3 ≈ 0.0117. So sin(x) ≈ 0.2269 - 0.0117/6 = 0.2269 - 0.00195 ≈ 0.22495. So that's about 0.225. So my initial approximation was correct.

So 1.33 * 0.22495 = approx 0.2986. Then 0.2986 / 2.42. Let me compute that: 2.42 * 0.12 is 0.2904. 0.2986 - 0.2904 = 0.0082. So 0.0082 /2.42 = approx 0.003388. So total is 0.12 + 0.003388 = 0.123388. So sin(theta2) ≈ 0.1234.

Now, what's the angle where sin(theta) is 0.1234? Let me think about the sine values. Sin(7 degrees) is about 0.12187, sin(7.1) is about 0.1235. So theta2 is approximately 7.1 degrees. So the answer should be option G, 7.1 degrees.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: using a calculator for more precise calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the options have a different answer. Wait, looking at the options, option G is 7.1. That's one of the choices. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Wait, wait—Snell's Law is n1 sin(theta1) = n2 sin(theta2). So 1.33 * sin(13) = 2.42 * sin(theta2). So solving for theta2: theta2 = arcsin( (1.33 * sin(13)) / 2.42 )

Let me compute 1.33 * sin(13) / 2.42. Assume sin(13) is 0.22495.

So (1.33 * 0.22495) = approx 0.2986. Divide by 2.42: 0.2986 / 2.42 = approx 0.1234. So sin(theta2)=0.1234, which is about 7.1 degrees. So the correct answer should be G:7.1 degrees.

Looking back at the options, option G is 7.1, which is the calculation. So I think that's the right choice.

To determine the angle of refraction when light travels from water (\(n_1 = 1.33\)) to diamond (\(n_2 = 2.42\)) with an angle of incidence (\(\theta_1\)) of 13°, we use Snell's Law:

\[
n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2)
\]

Rearranging for \(\theta_2\):

\[
\theta_2 = \arcsin\left(\frac{n_1 \sin(\theta_1)}{n_2}\right)
\]

1. Calculate \(\sin(13^\circ)\): Using approximations, \(\sin(13^\circ) \approx 0.22495\).
2. Compute \(n_1 \sin(\theta_1)\):  
   \[
   1.33 \times 0.22495 \approx 0.2986
   \]
3. Divide by \(n_2\):  
   \[
   \frac{0.2986}{2.42} \approx 0.1234
   \]
4. Find \(\theta_2 = \arcsin(0.1234)\):  
   Using approximations, \(\arcsin(0.1234) \approx 7.1^\circ\).

Thus, the angle of refraction is approximately **7.1°**, which corresponds to option **G**.
