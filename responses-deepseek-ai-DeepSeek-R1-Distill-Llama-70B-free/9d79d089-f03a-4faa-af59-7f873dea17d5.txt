Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electromagnetism, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

The question has two parts, (a) and (b), each asking about different materials. I need to find the index of refraction and phase velocity for each scenario.

Starting with part (a): Paraffin has a relative permittivity ε_r = 2.1. I remember that the index of refraction η (sometimes denoted as n) is related to the permittivity and permeability of the medium. I think the formula is η equals the square root of (ε_r multiplied by μ_r), because the refractive index comes from the square root of the product of the relative permittivity and relative permeability. 

Wait, but paraffin is a non-magnetic material, right? So its relative permeability μ_r should be 1. Yeah, I think that's correct. So η would just be the square root of ε_r. So √2.1. Let me calculate that. The square root of 2 is about 1.414, and √2.1 should be a bit more. Hmm, maybe around 1.45. So η ≈ 1.45.

Next, the phase velocity v. I remember that the phase velocity in a medium is given by v = c / η, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, approximately 3×10^8 m/s. So if η is 1.45, then v = 3e8 / 1.45. Let me compute that. 3e8 divided by 1.45. Let's see, 3e8 is 300,000,000. Dividing by 1.45: 300,000,000 / 1.45 ≈ 206,896,550 m/s, which is about 2.07 × 10^8 m/s. Wait, that's the phase velocity for paraffin.

Wait a second, no. Wait no, I think I made a mistake. Because phase velocity v is c divided by η. So if η is 1.45, then v is 3e8 / 1.45. Let me compute that correctly. 3e8 is 300,000,000. 300,000,000 divided by 1.45: 1.45 times 200 million is 290 million, right? Because 1.45 * 2e8 = 290e6. Then the remainder is 10e6. 10e6 divided by 1.45 is approximately 6.89655e6. So 2e8 + 6.89655e6 is 206,896,550 m/s. So that's approximately 2.07e8 m/s. So part (a) should have η = 1.45 and v = ~2.07e8 m/s.

Wait, but looking back, no, wait—the index of refraction is η = sqrt(ε_r * μ_r), which for paraffin is sqrt(2.1 * 1) = sqrt(2.1) ≈1.45. So that's correct.

Now part (b): Distilled water has σ ≈ 0, ε_r =81, μ_r=1. So again, since it's non-conductive (σ=0) and non-magnetic, μ_r=1.

So η is sqrt(ε_r * μ_r) = sqrt(81 *1 )=9.

Then phase velocity v is c/η = 3e8 m/s /9 = 1/3 of 3e8, which is 1e8 m/s. Wait wait, no, 3e8 divided by 9 is 3e8 /9 = 1e8 /3 ≈ 3.333e7 m/s. Because 3e8 is 300,000,000. Divided by 9, that's 33,333,333.333... So 3.333e7 m/s.

Wait, but wait, I might be getting confused between phase velocity and other velocities. Oh, but in a non-conducting medium (σ=0), the phase velocity is v = 1 / sqrt(με). Since μ is μ0 and ε is ε_r ε0, so v = 1/(sqrt(μ0 ε_r ε0)) ) = c / sqrt(ε_r), because c is 1/sqrt(μ0 ε0). So yes, with ε_r=81, sqrt(81)=9, so v= c /9 = (3e8)/9 = 3.333e7 m/s.

So for part (a), η is 1.45, v is 2.07e8 m/s. For part (b), η is 9, v is 3.33e7 m/s.

Now looking at the options. I need to find which option matches these values. Let's look at each option:

Option A: (a) η=2.1, v=1.45e8. No, because (a) η should be 1.45, not 2.1.

Option B: (a) η=1.45, v=2.07e8. (b) η=9, v=3.33e7. Wait, wait, looking at B: for (a), η=1.45, v=2.07e8, which matches. For (b), η=9, v=3.33e7. So B's (b) part says v=3.33e7, which matches. So option B looks correct.

Wait, I need to check each option. Let me make sure. Let's go through each part.

Option B: (a) η=1.45, v=2.07e8 m/s. (b) η=9, v=3.33e7 m/s. That's exactly what I calculated.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check again. The options are a bit confusing because each option gives two sets of η and v. So the first part is (a), the second is (b). So for option B:

(a) η = 1.45, v = 2.07 × 10^8 m/s. (b) η = 9, v =3.33 ×10^7 m/s.

Which is exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait, looking back at the options again, I might have misread. Let me read the options again.

Option B: η = 1.45, v = 2.07 × 10^8 meters/sec; η =9, v =3.33 ×10^7 meters/sec.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option B.

To solve the problem, we analyze each part systematically:

### Part (a): Paraffin
Paraffin has a relative permittivity \( \epsilon_r = 2.1 \) and is non-magnetic, so \( \mu_r = 1 \). 

1. **Index of Refraction (\( \eta \))**:  
   The index of refraction is given by:  
   \[
   \eta = \sqrt{\epsilon_r \cdot \mu_r} = \sqrt{2.1 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{2.1} \approx 1.45
   \]

2. **Phase Velocity (\( v \))**:  
   The phase velocity in a medium is given by:  
   \[
   v = \frac{c}{\eta}, \quad \text{where } c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \eta = 1.45 \):  
   \[
   v = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{1.45} \approx 2.07 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
   \]

Thus, for paraffin:  
\[
\eta \approx 1.45, \quad v \approx 2.07 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

---

### Part (b): Distilled Water
Distilled water has \( \sigma \approx 0 \), \( \epsilon_r = 81 \), and \( \mu_r = 1 \). 

1. **Index of Refraction (\( \eta \))**:  
   Using the same formula:  
   \[
   \eta = \sqrt{\epsilon_r \cdot \mu_r} = \sqrt{81 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{81} = 9
   \]

2. **Phase Velocity (\( v \))**:  
   Using \( v = \frac{c}{\eta} \) and substituting \( \eta = 9 \):  
   \[
   v = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{9} \approx 3.33 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s}
   \]

Thus, for distilled water:  
\[
\eta = 9, \quad v \approx 3.33 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s}
\]

---

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:  
- For part (a): \( \eta = 1.45, v = 2.07 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)  
- For part (b): \( \eta = 9, v = 3.33 \times 10^7 \, \text{m/s} \)  

The option that matches these values is **Option B**.

**Final Answer:**  
B
