Okay, so I've got this question about a microscope's magnifying power. Hmm, I remember from my optics class that the magnifying power of a microscope depends on both the objective and the eyepiece. Let me think about the formula. I think it's the product of the magnifications of the two lenses.

Wait, the magnifying power (M) is given by M = (f_e / f_o) + 1? Or is it just the product of the magnifications of each lens? Oh right, the formula for the magnifying power of a compound microscope is M = ( (f_e) / (f_o) ) + 1. Or wait, no, wait. Oh wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I think the magnification is the product of the objective's magnification and the eyepiece's magnification.

The objective forms a real image just inside the focal length of the eyepiece. So the magnification comes from the combination. I remember that the total magnification M is given by M = (L / f_o) * (f_e / (f_e - f_o)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach: the magnification of the objective is (L / f_o), and the eyepiece acts as a magnifying glass, with magnification (25 cm / f_e), but wait, that's when it's used as a simple magnifier. Or perhaps the standard formula is M = (f_e) / (f_o), multiplied by a factor. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the standard formula is M = (f_e / f_o) * ( (L) / (L - f_o - f_e) )) or something like that. Alternatively, maybe it's simpler. I think the approximate formula when the microscope is in normal use (so the image is at infinity) is M = (f_e) / (f_o) multiplied by the tube length, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to think again. The magnification of the objective is (L / f_o), where L is the tube length. Then the eyepiece's magnification is (25 cm / f_e), but wait, that's when it's used as a simple magnifier. But in a microscope setup, perhaps the eyepiece's magnification is just (L / f_e). No, that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula for the magnifying power of a microscope is M = (f_e / f_o) multiplied by ( (L) / (f_e - f_o) ), but I'm not sure. Wait, another thought: the magnifying power is the product of the magnifications of the two lenses. The objective's magnification is (L / f_o), and the eyepiece's is (25 cm / f_e), but that would be when the eyepiece is used as a magnifier. But in a microscope, the eyepiece is used differently. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula M = (f_e / f_o) * ( (L - f_o - f_e) / f_e ) )? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should recall that the magnification of the objective is (L / f_o), where L is the tube length. The eyepiece's magnification is (1 + (L / f_e)). So the total magnification would be the product: M = (L/f_o) * (1 + (L/f_e)).

Wait, let me think. The objective produces an image just inside the eyepiece's focal point. So the eyepiece is acting like a magnifying glass. The magnification of the eyepiece when used as a magnifier is (25 cm / f_e). But if L is the distance between the two lenses (tube length), then L = f_o + f_e. Oh wait, no, the tube length is the distance between the two focal points. So L = f_o + f_e.

Wait, but in this problem, the tube length is given as 10 cm. The focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece are 0.5 cm and 2 cm, respectively. So L = f_o + f_e? Let's see: 0.5 + 2 = 2.5 cm, but the tube is 10 cm. So that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something.

Alternatively, I think the formula for magnification is M = (f_e / f_o) * ( (L) / (L - f_o - f_e) ) ). Wait, but if L is 10 cm and f_o is 0.5, f_e is 2, then f_o + f_e = 2.5 cm, so L - (f_o + f_e) = 7.5 cm. So M would be (2 / 0.5) * (10 / 7.5) ) = (4) * (1.333...) = about 5.333... That doesn't seem right because the options given are much higher, like 100, 200, etc.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. I think the standard formula for the magnifying power of a microscope is M = (f_e / f_o) multiplied by ( (L) / (f_e - f_o) ). Wait, but if f_e is 2 and f_o is 0.5, then f_e - f_o is 1.5. So 2/0.5 is 4, and 10/1.5 is about 6.666. So 4 * 6.666 is about 26.666. That's not an option either.

Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Let me try to recall. Oh wait, another approach: the magnification of the objective is (L / f_o), and the magnification of the eyepiece is (25 cm / f_e). So M = (L/f_o) * (25/f_e). Let's plug in the numbers.

L is 10 cm, f_o is 0.5 cm, f_e is 2 cm.

So M = (10 / 0.5) * (25 / 2) = (20) * (12.5) = 250. Hmm, 250 is option F. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Because in a microscope, the eyepiece is used in a different way than a simple magnifier. Oh, right! In a microscope, the image formed by the objective is just inside the focal point of the eyepiece, so the eyepiece acts as a magnifying glass with a magnification of (25 cm / f_e). So that part seems correct.

So M = (L / f_o) * (25 / f_e) = (10 / 0.5) * (25 / 2) = 20 * 12.5 = 250. So the answer would be F: 250. But wait, looking at the options provided, option F is 250. But I'm not sure if I should use 25 cm as the near point or if it's 10 cm in this case.

Wait, wait, no. The near point for the eyepiece might just be the standard 25 cm, so using that in the formula is correct. So then M would be 250. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, the formula might be M = ( (L) / (f_o) ) * ( (f_e) / (f_e - f_o) ) ), but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the magnification is just (f_e / f_o) multiplied by (L / (f_e - f_o)). Let me try that. f_e is 2, f_o is 0.5, so f_e/f_o =4. L is 10, f_e - f_o is 1.5. So 4 * (10/1.5) = 4 * 6.666... = 26.666. No, that's not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the magnifying power is given by M = (f_e / f_o) * ( (L - f_o) / f_e ). No, that would be (2/0.5) * ( (10 - 0.5)/2 ) = 4 * (9.5/2) = 4 * 4.75 = 19, which is not an option either.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find the correct formula. Oh, wait, the correct formula for the magnifying power of a microscope is M = (f_e / f_o) * ( (L) / (L - f_o - f_e) ) ). So let's compute that.

Given: L =10, f_o=0.5, f_e=2.

So denominator is 10 - 0.5 -2 =7.5 cm.

So M = (2/0.5) * (10/7.5) )=4 * 1.333... = approx 5.333. That's way too low. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a step. Oh wait, maybe the formula is M = (f_e / f_o) * ( (L + f_e) / f_e ) )? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the formula is M = (L / f_o) * (f_e / (f_e - f_o)). Let me try that.

L=10, f_o=0.5, f_e=2.

So M = (10/0.5) * (2/(2-0.5)) )=20 * (2/1.5) =20 * 1.333...=26.666. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is M = ( (f_e + L) / f_e ) * ( (L) / f_o ) ). Hmm, let me think. f_e + L is 2 +10=12, so (12/2)=6. L/f_o is 20. 6*20=120. Option H is 200, which is close to double that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Another way to think: the magnification of the objective is (L/f_o), which is 10/0.5=20. The eyepiece magnification is (25 cm / f_e) as it's acting as a magnifying glass. So 25/2=12.5. So total magnification is 20 *12.5=250, which is option F.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because the eyepiece in a microscope might not use the full 25 cm. Because the image is formed just inside the eyepiece's focal length, so maybe the magnification is (f_e / (f_e - f_o)) or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the eyepiece's magnification is (25 cm / f_e), which would make sense.

So perhaps the correct calculation is 250, which is option F. But wait, let me cross-check. I remember that for a microscope, the magnifying power is often given by M = (f_e / f_o) * ( (L) / (f_e - f_o) ) ). Let's see what that gives.

f_e=2, f_o=0.5 → 2/0.5=4.

L=10, f_e - f_o=1.5 →10/1.5≈6.666.

4 *6.666≈26.666. But that's not an option. So perhaps that formula isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is M = (f_e / f_o) * ( (L) / (f_e) ), which would be (2/0.5)*(10/2)=4 *5=20, which is option G. But that seems too low.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Maybe I should remember that the standard formula for the magnification of a microscope is M = (f_e / f_o) multiplied by the tube length divided by the eyepiece's focal length. No, that doesn't sound right.

Alternatively, perhaps the magnification is (f_e / f_o) multiplied by the power of the eyepiece. Wait, the power is 1/f in meters, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The magnification of the objective is (L / f_o) = 10/0.5 =20. The eyepiece's magnification, since it's used as a magnifier, is (25 cm / f_e) =25/2=12.5. So total magnification is 20 *12.5=250, which is option F.

But I'm not entirely confident because I think the eyepiece in a microscope forms a virtual image, which might use a different formula. Wait, when the eyepiece is used as a magnifier, the image is formed at 25 cm, so the magnification is indeed (25/f_e) +1, but sometimes it's approximated as (25/f_e). So perhaps the correct answer is 250, option F.

The magnifying power of a microscope is determined by combining the magnifications of the objective and the eyepiece. The objective forms a real image just inside the focal length of the eyepiece, and the eyepiece acts as a magnifying glass. The total magnification is the product of the magnifications of the two lenses.

The magnification of the objective is given by:

\[
M_{\text{objective}} = \frac{L}{f_o}
\]

where \(L\) is the tube length and \(f_o\) is the focal length of the objective. Substituting \(L = 10 \, \text{cm}\) and \(f_o = 0.5 \, \text{cm}\):

\[
M_{\text{objective}} = \frac{10}{0.5} = 20
\]

The magnification of the eyepiece, when used as a magnifying glass, is approximately:

\[
M_{\text{eyepiece}} = \frac{25}{f_e}
\]

where \(f_e\) is the focal length of the eyepiece. Substituting \(f_e = 2 \, \text{cm}\):

\[
M_{\text{eyepiece}} = \frac{25}{2} = 12.5
\]

The total magnification of the microscope is the product of the two magnifications:

\[
M = M_{\text{objective}} \cdot M_{\text{eyepiece}} = 20 \cdot 12.5 = 250
\]

Thus, the magnifying power of the microscope is 250, which corresponds to option F.
