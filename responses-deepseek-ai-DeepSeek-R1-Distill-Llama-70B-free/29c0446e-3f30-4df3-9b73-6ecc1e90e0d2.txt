Okay, I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question, and I want to make sure I get it right. Let's break it down step by step.

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate whether each is true or false, or if the information isn't provided. The options are combinations of these evaluations for each statement.

Statement 1: "The Stanford Sentiment Treebank contained movie reviews, not book reviews." Hmm, I remember that the Stanford Sentiment Treebank is related to sentiment analysis. I think it's based on movie reviews. Wait, wasn't there something about Rotten Tomatoes? Oh right, the SST dataset uses movie reviews from Rotten Tomatoes. So Statement 1 is True because it correctly states that it's movie reviews, not book reviews.

Statement 2: "The Penn Treebank has been used for language modeling." The Penn Treebank is a well-known corpus in NLP. I believe it's primarily used for syntactic parsing, like training models for parse trees. But language modeling is a broader area. Wait, actually, the Penn Treebank is often used in language modeling tasks, maybe for training n-gram models or as part of larger datasets. Or perhaps I'm mixing it up with other treebanks. I'm not entirely certain about this one. I think it's True because Penn Treebank data is versatile and can be used for various NLP tasks, including language modeling.

So putting it together, Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is True. Looking at the options, option A is True, True. So the answer should be A.

The Stanford Sentiment Treebank uses movie reviews, making Statement 1 true. The Penn Treebank is used in language modeling, making Statement 2 true.
