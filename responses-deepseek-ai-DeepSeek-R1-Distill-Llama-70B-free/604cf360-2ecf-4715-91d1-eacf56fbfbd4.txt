Okay, so I've got this psychology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about Brittany who used address stickers sent by a charity, and then she felt obligated to donate. The question is asking what psychological concept this illustrates.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that there are several key concepts related to social influence and norms. Let me think. The options are A through J, each a different psychological term.

So, the scenario is that a charity sends stickers, and Brittany, after using them, feels she should donate. That sounds like she's feeling an obligation to reciprocate the charity's gift. Wait, isn't there a norm about reciprocation? Oh right, the reciprocity norm. That's when someone does something nice for you, and you feel compelled to return the favor.

Let me go through the options to make sure I'm not confusing anything. Option B is the reciprocity norm. That fits because Brittany is reciprocating the stickers by donating.

What about the other options? Stereotyping is making assumptions about people based on groups, which doesn't fit here. The halo effect is when one positive trait influences other judgments, like if someone is attractive, you think they're smart. Not relevant here.

The bystander effect is when people don't help because others are present. Not the case. The door-in-the-face technique is when someone asks for a big favor and then a smaller one, making the smaller seem reasonable. That doesn't fit because the charity didn't do that; they sent stickers first.

Cognitive dissonance is about holding conflicting thoughts and feeling discomfort, leading to a change. Brittany might feel this if she didn't want to donate but felt she should, but the question is more about the obligation to reciprocate, which points more directly to reciprocity.

The just-world phenomenon is believing that the world is fair, and people get what they deserve. Not exactly what's happening here. Self-serving bias is when people attribute their successes to themselves and failures to external factors. Doesn't fit.

Fundamental attribution error is overemphasizing personal characteristics and underestimating situational factors. Not applicable. Mere exposure effect is liking something more because you've been exposed to it more. Again, not quite.

So yeah, the best fit is the reciprocity norm. So the answer should be B.

The scenario describes Brittany feeling obligated to donate after receiving address stickers from a charity, which illustrates the reciprocity norm. This norm explains how people feel compelled to reciprocate when someone does something for them. Other options like stereotyping, the halo effect, bystander effect, door-in-the-face technique, cognitive dissonance, just-world phenomenon, self-serving bias, fundamental attribution error, and mere exposure effect do not fit the situation. 

Answer: B
