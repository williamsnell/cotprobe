Okay, so I've got this problem about a rectangular profile fin, and I need to find the height and thickness. Hmm, I've heard that for fins designed for minimum weight, there's an optimal condition that relates the dimensions. Let me think about what I remember.

The question says the maximum heat dissipation is 500 k cal per hour per meter width. Oh wait, the units might be important here. The fin's base is at 110°C, ambient is 10°C, so the temperature difference is 100°C. The heat transfer coefficient (h) is 90 kcal/m²-hr-°C, and thermal conductivity (k) is 35 k cal/m-hr-°C. Oh wait, wait, the units for k are kcal/(m·hr·°C), right?

I remember that the formula for heat transfer from a fin involves the formula Q = (h P A (T_base - T_ambient)) / some factor. But wait, for a rectangular fin, the formula is Q = (sqrt(h * k * A) ) * (T_base - T_ambient). Or wait, maybe the formula is Q = (h * P * A * (Tb - Ta)) * something... Wait, no. Oh right, the efficiency and effectiveness of fins come into play, but I think for this particular case, when the fin is designed for minimum weight, the optimal condition is when the height (L) is such that L = (k/(h)) * (h/k)^{1/2} ? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, I think the condition for minimum weight relates the height and thickness somehow. Oh right, for a rectangular fin to have minimum weight for a given heat dissipation, the optimal condition occurs when the ratio of height to thickness (L/t) is sqrt(k/(h)) ). Wait, no, perhaps it's when L = (5/2) * sqrt(k/(h)) * t. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, I think the general formula for the heat dissipated by a rectangular fin is Q = (h * P * A * (Tb - Ta)) * (tanh(L * sqrt(h/(k A)) )) / (sqrt(h/(k A)) ), but maybe that's for other shapes. Alternatively, another approach is that for a rectangular fin, the heat transfer Q is given by:

Q = (h * (2L + t) * t * L) * (Tb - Ta) * ( (sinh(mL)) / (mL * cosh(mL)) ) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, for a rectangular fin with negligible tip heat loss, the formula is Q = (h * P * A * (Tb - Ta)) * (tanh(mL) / (mL)), where m is sqrt(h/(k A)).

Wait, but this might be getting complicated. Alternatively, I remember that for the optimal fin (minimum weight), the condition is that the temperature gradient at the base is zero. Wait, the question states that the thermal gradient at the fin base is zero, so that's an important condition. So that would imply that the fin is operating under the condition where the heat loss is maximum, which I think relates to an optimal dimension.

Wait, another approach: when the fin is designed for maximum heat dissipation per unit volume (minimum weight), the optimal condition occurs when the height (length) L is related to the thickness t by the equation L = ( (2k)/(h) )^(1/2) * t. Wait, maybe that's the formula. Or perhaps L = (k/(h)) * t. Hmm.

Wait, let me think in terms of variables. The heat dissipated Q depends on the dimensions of the fin. For a rectangular fin, Q is given by:

Q = (h * (2L + t) * t * L) * (Tb - Ta) * ( (sinh(mL)) ) / (mL cosh(mL) + sin(mL) (h/(k)) ) )

Wait, that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the formula for the heat dissipated by a rectangular fin when the tip is insulated (no heat loss), which would give Q = (h * P * A * (Tb - Ta)) * ( (tanh(mL)) / (mL) ), where m = sqrt(h/(k A)).

Wait, but the problem states that the maximum heat dissipation is given, so perhaps we can set up the equation using this approach.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Calculate the heat dissipated Q per meter width. So Q = 500 k cal/(m·hr). Since the fin is per meter width, the width is 1 m.

2. The base temperature is 110°C, ambient is 10°C, so ΔT = 100°C.

3. The heat transfer coefficient h is 90 kcal/(m²·hr·°C).

4. Thermal conductivity k is 35 kcal/(m·hr·°C).

I think the formula for Q when the thermal gradient at the base is zero (which is given) would be for a fin of certain length L and thickness t. So perhaps the formula is Q = (h * k * t * L) * (Tb - Ta) / (h + k) )? No, wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, when the base gradient is zero, it implies that the fin is very long, and the tip condition approaches that of an infinitely long fin, but that's not the case here.

Wait, no, the condition of zero thermal gradient at the base implies that the fin is designed such that the tip is at the same temperature as the base. No, wait, that's not right. Wait, if the thermal gradient at the base is zero, that suggests that the derivative of temperature with respect to position is zero at the base. Hmm. Wait, in the case of a fin with a certain length, the temperature distribution would typically have a negative gradient at the base (since the tip is cooler). But if the gradient is zero, that would mean that the tip is at the same temperature as the base, which would require an infinitely long fin. But that's not practical. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the condition.

Wait, maybe the problem is referring to the optimal condition, where the fin's dimensions are such that the heat dissipation is maximized for a given volume, which is the condition of minimum weight. So perhaps the condition is that (dQ/dV) = 0, leading to the optimal dimensions.

I think for a rectangular fin, the optimal condition occurs when the ratio of height to thickness is L = (2k/h)^(1/2) * t. Or maybe L = (k/(h))^(0.5) * t.

Wait, I found a formula online before that for a rectangular fin, the optimal condition (minimum weight) occurs when the length is L = sqrt( (2k)/(h) ) * t. Or was it L = sqrt( (k)/(h) ) * t? I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the heat transfer equation.

The heat transfer Q from a rectangular fin can be expressed as Q = (h * P * A * (Tb - Ta)) * (tanh(mL) ) / (mL ), where m = sqrt(h/(k A)). Wait, that's for a rectangular fin with the tip condition.

But since the problem states that the thermal gradient at the base is zero, that suggests that the fin is designed such that the tip is at the same temperature as the base, which would imply that the fin is infinitely long, which isn't possible. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition of zero thermal gradient at the base implies that the fin is operating under the optimal condition for maximum heat dissipation. So we can proceed using the optimal condition.

Let me try to approach this with the formula for the heat dissipated by a rectangular fin:

Q = (h * (2L + t) * t * L) * (Tb - Ta) * ( (sinh(mL)) ) / (mL * cosh(mL) + sin(mL) (h/(k)) ) )

Wait, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for Q when the fin is designed for minimum weight, which would have a certain relation between L and t.

Wait, another approach: The problem gives Q as 500 kcal/(m·hr). So per meter width, the fin has a certain area. Let me consider the fin's cross-section.

The volume of the fin per meter width would be A = t * L, since the width is 1 m.

The heat dissipated is Q = (h * P * A * (Tb - Ta)) * (some efficiency factor). For a rectangular fin, the efficiency is (tanh(mL)) / (mL ), where m = sqrt(h/(k A)).

Wait, but since the problem states the gradient at the base is zero, maybe that implies that the efficiency is maximum, which would be when tanh(mL) = 1, meaning that mL approaches infinity, so L approaches infinity. But that can't be right because the options have finite lengths.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find the relation between L and t when the fin is designed for minimum weight. For a rectangular fin, the condition for minimum weight (optimal) occurs when the ratio of length to thickness is L = sqrt( (2k)/(h) ) * t. Or wait, perhaps L = sqrt( (k)/(h) ) * t. Let me check the units to see which makes sense.

Wait, the units for k are kcal/(m·hr·°C), and h is kcal/(m²·hr·°C). So sqrt( (k)/(h) ) would have units of m, which makes sense because L is in meters. So the formula would be L = sqrt(k/(h)) * t.

Wait, but let me compute sqrt(k/h) with the given values.

k = 35 kcal/(m·hr·°C)
h = 90 kcal/(m²·hr·°C)

So k/h = (35) / (90) ) (m²·hr·°C)/(m·hr·°C) )? Wait, no, let's see:

Wait, k's unit is (kcal/(m·hr·°C)), h's is (kcal/(m²·hr·°C)).

So when you compute k/h, the units are (kcal/(m·hr·°C)) ) / (kcal/(m²·hr·°C)) ) = m²/(m·hr·°C) * (m·hr·°C)/(kcal) )? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think in terms of units:

k/h = (35 kcal/(m·hr·°C)) / (90 kcal/(m²·hr·°C)) ) = (35/90) * (m²) ), because the other terms cancel out: (1/m·hr·°C) / (1/m²·hr·°C) ) = m². So sqrt(k/h) would have unit m, which matches L's unit.

So sqrt(k/h) = sqrt(35/90) m. Let's compute that:

35/90 = 0.3888...
sqrt(0.3888) ≈ 0.6236 meters, or 62.36 mm.

So L = 0.6236 * t, where t is in meters as well.

Wait, but the options are in mm, so perhaps I need to convert.

Alternatively, maybe I should express t in mm and L in mm.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the relation between L and t as L = sqrt(k/(h)) * t, so if I can find Q in terms of t, then set it to 500 kcal/(m·hr) and solve for t.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to express Q in terms of L and t.

Wait, the heat dissipated by a rectangular fin when the tip is insulated (no heat loss) is given by Q = (h * (2L + t) * t * L) * (Tb - Ta) * (tanh(mL) / (mL)), where m = sqrt(h/(k * A)), and A is the cross-sectional area (t * 1 m, since width is 1 m).

Wait, but the area A would be t * 1 m, so A = t meters squared per meter width. Wait, no, the area is in m², but since the width is 1 m, A = t * 1 m².

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach it differently.

We have Q = 500 k cal/(m·hr), h = 90, k = 35, Tb - Ta = 100°C.

The formula for Q when the fin is of optimal dimensions (for minimum weight) is Q = (h * k * t * L * (Tb - Ta)) / (h + k) )? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for Q when the fin is designed for minimum weight, which is when L = sqrt( (2k)/(h) ) * t. Wait, I'm not certain about this.

Wait, let me think about the optimization. To minimize the volume (weight) for a given Q, we need to set dV/dQ to zero or something. Alternatively, the optimal condition arises when the increase in Q with L equals the increase in volume with L.

But maybe it's easier to proceed with the formula for Q for a rectangular fin.

Wait, another approach: The heat dissipated from a rectangular fin is given by:

Q = (h * P * A * (Tb - Ta)) * ( (tanh(mL)) / (mL) )

Where P is the perimeter, A is the cross-sectional area.

For a rectangular fin, P = 2(L + t), and A = L * t.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the fin is a rectangle of length L (height) and thickness t. So the cross-sectional area A would be L * t, and the perimeter P would be 2(L + t). But since the fin's width is 1 m, perhaps the perimeter is 2(L + t), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, for a rectangular fin, the cross-section is a rectangle of thickness t and height L. So the perimeter P is 2(L + t), and the area A is L * t.

Wait, but in the formula for Q, the perimeter and area are involved in m = sqrt(h/(k A)).

So m = sqrt( h / (k A) )

In this case, since the width is 1 m, A (cross-sectional area) is L * t, so m = sqrt( h / (k L t) )

But I'm not sure if I'm on the right track here.

The heat dissipated Q is given by:

Q = (h * P * A * (Tb - Ta)) * ( (tanh(mL)) / (mL) )

Wait, but P is the perimeter, which for a rectangular cross-section is 2(L + t). So substituting, P = 2(L + t).

So Q = h * 2(L + t) * (L t) * (Tb - Ta) * ( tanh(mL) / (mL) )

But this seems complicated because m itself depends on L and t. Let me substitute m into the equation:

m = sqrt( h / (k L t) )

So,

tanh(mL) = tanh( sqrt( h/(k L t) ) * L )

= tanh( sqrt( h L/(k t) ) )

Hmm, this is getting too involved. Maybe I should proceed by assuming the optimal condition, where L = sqrt( k/(h) ) * t, as I thought earlier.

So let me set L = sqrt( k / h ) * t.

Then, L = sqrt(35 / 90) * t ≈ sqrt(0.3889) * t ≈ 0.6236 * t meters.

Wait, but if L is in meters and t is in meters, then 0.6236 * t would be in meters as well.

But let's proceed.

Now, substituting L = 0.6236 t into the Q equation.

Wait, let's compute m:

m = sqrt( h/(k A) ) = sqrt( h / (k * L t) )

Since L = 0.6236 t,

m = sqrt( 90 / (35 * 0.6236 t * t) ) = sqrt( 90 / (35 * 0.6236 * t²) )

Compute 35 * 0.6236 ≈ 21.826, so 90 / 21.826 ≈ 4.126.

Thus, m = sqrt(4.126 / t² ) = sqrt(4.126) / t ≈ 2.031 / t.

But L = 0.6236 t, so mL = (2.031 / t) * 0.6236 t ≈ 1.265 meters? Wait, that can't be right because t is in meters, so 2.031/t would have unit 1/m, multiplied by L in meters gives dimensionless.

Wait, but let me compute mL:

mL = (2.031 / t) * 0.6236 t = 2.031 * 0.6236 ≈ 1.265.

So tanh(mL) = tanh(1.265) ≈ 0.80.

Now, back to the Q equation:

Q = h * 2(L + t) * (L t) * (Tb - Ta) * (tanh(mL) ) / (mL )

Plugging in the values:

h = 90, Tb - Ta = 100, L = 0.6236 t, and we have Q = 500.

So:

500 = 90 * 2*(0.6236 t + t) * (0.6236 t * t) * 100 * (0.8) / (1.265)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute (0.6236 t + t) = t (0.6236 + 1) = 1.6236 t.

So 2*(0.6236 t + t) = 2 * 1.6236 t = 3.2472 t.

Next, (0.6236 t * t) = 0.6236 t².

So the product h * 2*(...) * (...) becomes 90 * 3.2472 t * 0.6236 t².

Compute 90 * 3.2472 = 90 * 3.2472 ≈ 292.248.

292.248 * 0.6236 ≈ let's compute 292 *
