Question:

A husband and wife owned and operated a grocery store. The grocery store was situated in the first floor of the building in which the husband and wife occupied a second-floor apartment. Late one evening, the defendant was walking past the grocery store when he decided to steal the money he heard had been stashed in a cigar box inside the store. The defendant furtively walked to the rear of the building. He then proceeded to open the gate to the fenced-in back yard. Once inside the back yard, the defendant attempted to pry open the back window of the grocery store. Awakened by the barking of his watchdog, the husband went out onto his second- floor back porch and saw the defendant below. The husband yelled at the defendant. Startled, the defendant turned to run when he noticed a large package lying outside the rear door to the store. The defendant picked up the package, which contained baked bread that had been delivered earlier in the evening, and the defendant then ran off. Which of the following crimes will the defendant most likely be convicted of?

Options:

A: Burglary and theft.
B: Larceny and burglary.
C: Larceny.
D: Attempted burglary and theft.
E: Trespassing and attempted burglary.
F: Trespassing and larceny.
G: Burglary.
H: Attempted larceny.
I: Larceny and attempted burglary.
J: Trespassing, larceny and attempted burglary.

Alright, let's try to figure out this question. It's a criminal law multiple-choice question, so I need to carefully analyze the scenario and apply the relevant legal principles.

First, let me read the question again. So, there's a husband and wife who own a grocery store on the first floor of a building where they live in a second-floor apartment. One evening, the defendant decides to steal money he heard was in a cigar box inside the store. He goes to the back of the building, opens the gate to the fenced backyard, and tries to pry open the back window of the store. The husband, awakened by the watchdog, goes to the porch, sees the defendant, yells at him. The defendant gets startled, notices a package outside the rear door, picks it up, and runs off. The package had baked bread delivered earlier.

The question is asking which crimes the defendant is most likely to be convicted of. The options are combinations of burglary, larceny, attempted burglary, theft, trespassing, etc.

So, to approach this, I need to break it down step by step.

First, what's burglary? Burglary typically involves the unlawful entry into a building with the intent to commit a felony inside, often theft. So, the key elements are: breaking and entering, into a structure, with felonious intent.

In this case, the defendant tried to pry open the back window. So, was there a breaking? Well, attempting to pry open a window could be considered an attempt to break in, but if he didn't actually enter, it might be attempted burglary.

Wait, but then he didn't actually get inside the store through the window. So maybe the burglary isn't complete. But did he enter the backyard? The backyard is fenced and he opened the gate. So, he was trespassing there. But trespassing alone isn't burglary unless it's part of the elements.

So, the defendant's initial plan was to break into the store through the window, which would be burglary. But he didn't actually enter the store. So, perhaps he's guilty of attempted burglary.

Then, after being startled, he picked up a package that was outside the rear door and ran. So, he took the package containing bread. That's taking property without consent, so that's larceny or theft.

So, combining these, he tried to commit burglary but didn't complete it, so attempted burglary. Then, he committed larceny by taking the package.

Wait, but is taking the package considered larceny? Yes, because he took it with the intent to permanently deprive the owner. So, that's larceny.

So, the charges would be attempted burglary and larceny.

Looking at the options: Option D is Attempted burglary and theft. Option I is larceny and attempted burglary.

Wait, what's the difference between theft and larceny? They're often used interchangeably, but in some jurisdictions, theft can include larceny, embezzlement, etc. But since the defendant took the package, it's larceny. So D says theft, which would include larceny.

But some options combine attempted burglary and larceny. Option D says attempted burglary and theft, which is perhaps the same as larceny.

Alternatively, is there another angle?

Wait, the defendant entered the backyard, which is part of the building's curtilage. If the backyard is part of the store's property, then entering without permission could be trespassing, but that's a separate offense. However, the main issue is the attempted break-in and the larceny.

So, the possible charges are attempted burglary and larceny (theft). So, looking at the options, option D is attempted burglary and theft. Option I is larceny and attempted burglary.

Wait, the order doesn't matter, right? So both D and I are the same in terms of the crimes. But looking back, option D is "Attempted burglary and theft," and I is "Larceny and attempted burglary." So, the difference is whether the theft is considered larceny or a separate theft charge. But in this case, the taking of the package is larceny, which is a type of theft. So both options D and I are similar.

Wait, but let's read the options again.

Option D: Attempted burglary and theft.

Option I: Larceny and attempted burglary.

So, in terms of the crimes, they're the same. But perhaps in the answer options, the order doesn't matter. So D and I are the same.

Wait, but looking at the choices, perhaps I missed something else. Let me think again.

Wait, the defendant first tried to commit burglary by attempting to break in through the window. But he didn't enter the store. So, that's attempted burglary.

Then, he took the package that was outside the store. So, that's larceny, as he took the property without consent. So, the two crimes are attempted burglary and larceny.

So, the correct option would be the one that includes both. So, looking at the options, option I is larceny and attempted burglary, which fits. Option D says attempted burglary and theft, which would be the same as I, because theft includes larceny.

But wait, did the defendant commit both crimes? So, he attempted burglary (for trying to break in) and larceny (for taking the package). So, the correct answer should include both.

Looking back, option D is "Attempted burglary and theft." Theft could encompass larceny, but is theft a separate crime or the same as larceny? In some jurisdictions, theft is the broader term, including larceny, embezzlement, etc. So, taking the package would be larceny, which is a form of theft. So, D is correct because it includes both attempted burglary and theft (which covers the larceny).

Alternatively, option I says "Larceny and attempted burglary," which is the same set of crimes but in a different order. So, both D and I seem correct. Wait, but looking again, the options are:

Option D: Attempted burglary and theft.

Option I: Larceny and attempted burglary.

So, perhaps in the context of the question, the correct answer is D because the theft is the more general term, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is I because larceny is the specific crime committed when taking the package.

Wait, but the initial plan was to steal from the store, so the defendant had the intent to commit larceny inside the store when he tried to break in. So, the attempted burglary would include the intent to commit larceny. However, when he actually took the package outside, that's a separate larceny.

So, the defendant is guilty of attempted burglary (for the attempted break-in with intent to commit larceny) and larceny (for taking the package). So, the two crimes are attempted burglary and larceny. So, the correct option is I: Larceny and attempted burglary.

Wait, but option D says "Attempted burglary and theft." Theft includes larceny, so D would also be correct. Hmm. I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, but the answer options are exclusive. So, which is the correct one?

Alternatively, perhaps the defendant only committed attempted burglary and larceny. So, the correct answer would be option I.

But wait, looking at the options again, option D is "Attempted burglary and theft." Theft can include larceny, but the defendant's act of taking the package is larceny. So, whether it's called theft or larceny might depend on the jurisdiction. But in common law, larceny is the specific crime, while theft is a broader term.

Wait, but in the scenario, the defendant took the package, which is larceny. So, the correct pairing is attempted burglary and larceny, which is option I.

Alternatively, some might consider that the taking of the package is theft, so option D would also be correct. But I think in the context of multiple-choice questions, they're looking for the most precise answer. Since the defendant took the package, that's larceny, not just theft. So, option I would be more precise.

Another point: the initial intent was to steal money from inside the store. So, when he tried to break in, that's attempted burglary with intent to commit larceny. Then, when he took the package, that's a separate larceny.

So, the crimes are attempted burglary and larceny, which is option I.

Wait, but option D says "theft," which may include larceny. So, both could be correct, but I think the more accurate answer is option I because it specifies larceny, which is exactly what happened when he took the package.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because the question may equate theft with larceny. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: when the defendant first tried to break into the store, he had the intent to commit larceny (steal money), so that's attempted burglary. Then, when he saw the package, he decided to take it. But is taking the package considered a separate crime? Yes, because it's an unlawful taking. So, that's larceny.

Therefore, the defendant is guilty of both attempted burglary and larceny. So, the correct answer is option I: Larceny and attempted burglary.

Wait, but option D is "Attempted burglary and theft." Theft would cover the larceny, but perhaps the answer expects the specific term larceny. So, I think option I is better.

Wait, but looking again, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me think about the elements.

Burglary requires unlawful entry into a structure with intent to commit a felony (like larceny). Here, the defendant didn't enter the store, so he can't be convicted of burglary, only attempted burglary.

Then, he took the package, which is larceny. So, the two crimes are attempted burglary and larceny. So, the correct option would include both.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Burglary and theft. → Incorrect, because no completed burglary.

B: Larceny and burglary. → No, same issue.

C: Larceny. → Only part of the story.

D: Attempted burglary and theft. → Theft covers larceny, so this is possible.

E: Trespassing and attempted burglary. → Trespassing is possible, but the main crimes are the attempt and larceny.

F: Trespassing and larceny. → Missing the attempted burglary.

G: Burglary. → No, not completed.

H: Attempted larceny. → He actually took the package, so it's not just attempted.

I: Larceny and attempted burglary. → This fits.

J: Trespassing, larceny, and attempted burglary. → Possible, but the question might be considering only the main crimes.

So, the correct answer is either D or I. But since the larceny is a specific crime, I think I is more accurate.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, theft is used as the general term, so D could be correct. However, traditionally, larceny is the specific intent crime. So, I think the answer is I.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer intended is D, but I'm not fully certain. But given the scenario, I think I is more precise.

The scenario involves a defendant who attempted to break into a grocery store through a back window with the intent to steal money, which constitutes **attempted burglary**. Additionally, the defendant took a package containing bread from outside the rear door, which is **larceny**. 

Key points:
1. **Attempted Burglary**: The defendant tried to pry open the back window of the store with the intent to commit theft. Since he did not successfully enter the store, this is attempted burglary, not completed burglary.
2. **Larceny**: The defendant unlawfully took the package containing bread, which satisfies the elements of larceny (trespassory taking and carrying away of property with intent to permanently deprive).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect, as there was no completed burglary.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as there was no completed burglary.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it only accounts for larceny and ignores the attempted burglary.
- **Option D**: Plausible, as theft can encompass larceny, but larceny is the more specific and accurate term for taking the package.
- **Option E**: Incorrect, as trespassing is not the primary offense compared to attempted burglary and larceny.
- **Option F**: Incorrect, as it omits the attempted burglary.
- **Option G**: Incorrect, as there was no completed burglary.
- **Option H**: Incorrect, as the defendant actually committed larceny, not just attempted larceny.
- **Option I**: Correct, as it accurately reflects the two crimes: larceny (for taking the package) and attempted burglary (for trying to break into the store).
- **Option J**: Incorrect, as trespassing is not the primary offense.

The most precise answer is **Option I: Larceny and attempted burglary**, as it specifically identifies the crimes committed without conflating theft and larceny.

Answer: I
