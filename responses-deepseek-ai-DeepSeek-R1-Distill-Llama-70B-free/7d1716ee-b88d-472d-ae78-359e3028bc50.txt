Okay, so I've got this question about Hooke's Law, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, I remember Hooke's Law from my physics class. Let me think... Oh right, Hooke's Law says that the force applied to a spring (or in this case, a tree branch) is proportional to the extension or bending it produces. So the formula is F equals k times x, where F is the force, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement.

The question says that if you hang by a tree branch and note how much it bends. Then, if you hang twice the weight, what happens? The options are A to J, each giving different possibilities about the bend.

Wait, so the initial scenario is hanging with a certain weight, let's say F1, which causes a bend of x1. Then, the weight is doubled to 2F1. According to Hooke's Law, F is proportional to x, so if F increases by a factor of 2, x should also increase by 2 times.

Let me look at the options. Option B says twice the bend. That makes sense because doubling the force would double the bending. But wait, let me check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A is three times, which doesn't fit because the force and bend are directly proportional. Option C says four times, but that would be if the relationship were quadratic, like if F were proportional to x squared. But Hooke's is linear. Oh wait, no, C says four times if the branch doesn't break. That's not right because doubling F would only double x under Hooke's Law.

Option D says no bend, which is impossible unless the branch is rigid, but Hooke's Law applies to elastic materials where some bending occurs. Option E says unpredictable, but Hooke's Law is a linear relationship, so it's predictable. Option F is half, which would be the case if the force were halved, but here the force is doubled. So F is wrong.

Option G is square root of weight, which would imply F proportional to sqrt(x), but that's not Hooke's Law. H is four times, same as C. I is a bend decreasing with weight, which doesn't make sense because increasing force should increase displacement. J says the same bend, which would mean F doesn't affect x, which is not the case.

Wait, wait. So the correct answer should be B: twice the bend. Because F is proportional to x, so if F doubles, x doubles.

According to Hooke's Law, the force applied to an elastic material (like a tree branch) is directly proportional to the resulting bend or displacement. This relationship is expressed as \( F = kx \), where \( F \) is the force, \( k \) is the spring constant, and \( x \) is the displacement. If the weight (force) is doubled, the bend (\( x \)) will also double, as the relationship is linear.

Analyzing the options:

- **A (three times the bend):** Incorrect, as Hooke's Law does not suggest a cubic relationship.
- **B (twice the bend):** Correct, as doubling the force results in a proportional doubling of the bend.
- **C (four times the bend):** Incorrect, as this would imply a quadratic relationship, which Hooke's Law does not support.
- **D (no bend at all):** Incorrect, as some bending is expected for an elastic material.
- **E (unpredictable):** Incorrect, as Hooke's Law provides a clear linear relationship.
- **F (half the bend):** Incorrect, as halving the bend would occur if the force were halved, not doubled.
- **G (bend proportional to the square root of weight):** Incorrect, as Hooke's Law is linear, not involving square roots.
- **H (four times the bend):** Incorrect, same reasoning as for option C.
- **I (bend decreases with increased weight):** Incorrect, as the bend increases with force according to Hooke's Law.
- **J (same bend):** Incorrect, as the bend changes with the applied force.

The correct answer is **B: twice the bend**, as doubling the weight doubles the force, which proportionally doubles the bend.

Answer: B
