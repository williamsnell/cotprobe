Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the first step to take when presenting new information to coworkers. The options are A through J. Hmm, I remember that when presenting information, especially in a work setting, there's a process to follow. 

First off, I think about what's usually the starting point in planning a presentation. Like, before you do anything else, you need to know what you're aiming to achieve. So, maybe setting an objective is the first step. That would make sense because knowing your objective helps guide everything else you do.

Looking at the options, D is "Determining the objective." That sounds right. Before you can create messages or visuals, you need to know what you're trying to accomplish. Without a clear objective, the rest might not be as effective.

But wait, what about the audience? I've heard that analyzing the audience is important. Option H is about that. I guess knowing your audience helps tailor the message, but does that come before determining the objective? Not sure. Maybe the objective is more fundamental because it's about what you want to achieve, regardless of the audience, but perhaps they go hand in hand.

Another thought: sometimes, people start by scheduling the meeting. Option A is sending calendar invites, which is practical. But you can't send invites without knowing when you're going to present, right? So maybe setting a date and time (F) comes before that. But is that the first step in presenting information? Probably not. The content comes before the logistics.

Creating key messages (B) and visual aids (C) are part of preparing the content, but again, you need to know the objective first. Otherwise, how do you know what messages to create?

Choosing a communication tool (I) could be early on, but maybe after knowing the objective and audience. Like, if the objective is to inform, maybe email is enough, but if it's to train, maybe a meeting.

Practicing in front of a mirror (J) is definitely a later step, after you've prepared the content. Setting up the room (E) is also logistical and comes later.

So putting it all together, the first step should be determining the objective. That sets the foundation for everything else. So the answer should be D.

The first step in effectively presenting new information to coworkers is to determine the objective, as it sets the foundation for all subsequent actions. 

Answer: D
