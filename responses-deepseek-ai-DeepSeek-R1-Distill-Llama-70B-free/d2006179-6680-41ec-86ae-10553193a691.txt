Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me about how free fatty acids are transported in the blood. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my biochemistry, but I'll try to think this through.

The question is asking about the transport of most free fatty acids. So I remember that fatty acids are a type of lipid, and lipids can't dissolve in blood on their own because blood is mostly water. That means they need some help to be transported around the body.

Wait, I think there are different ways lipids are transported. Like, cholesterol and triglycerides are often carried by lipoproteins, right? Those are like LDL and HDL that I've heard about. But the question is specifically about free fatty acids, not cholesterol or triglycerides.

Free fatty acids... I'm trying to recall. Oh, right! Free fatty acids are usually bound to a protein in the blood. I think the protein is called albumin. Albumin is a big protein in the blood plasma, and it helps carry various substances, including fatty acids, because they're hydrophobic and can't just float around in the bloodstream.

Let me go through the options to make sure. Option A says inside red blood cells. I don't think so because red blood cells don't have a lot of the machinery to carry fatty acids, and I don't recall them being the main transporters. Plus, most transport is probably in plasma.

Option B is combined with oxygen. No, that doesn't make sense. Oxygen is carried by hemoglobin in red blood cells, but fatty acids aren't related to that.

C says as triglycerides. No, triglycerides are a different form. Free fatty acids are not triglycerides; triglycerides are the storage form in adipose tissue. So that's not right.

D is as free molecules. No way, because they're not soluble enough. They need a carrier.

E says bound to white blood cells. I don't think so. White blood cells are more about immune responses, not transporting fatty acids.

F is as lipoproteins. Wait, I thought that was for cholesterol and triglycerides, not free fatty acids. Lipoproteins do carry some, but albumin is more for free fatty acids.

G is attached to hemoglobin. No, hemoglobin is for oxygen and carbon dioxide, not fatty acids.

H is combined with glucose. Definitely not. Glucose is a carbohydrate and doesn't mix with fatty acids in transport.

I is in the form of cholesterol. No, that's a different lipid.

J is bound to albumin. That rings a bell. Yes, I think this is correct. Albumin binds to free fatty acids, helping them move through the bloodstream.

So the answer should be J. Let me just make sure I'm not mixing this up. Free fatty acids are indeed transported bound to albumin, while lipoproteins carry other types of lipids like cholesterol and triglycerides. So option J is the right choice.

Free fatty acids are lipids that cannot dissolve in blood on their own, requiring a transport mechanism. Among the options provided, the correct method of transport is that free fatty acids are bound to albumin, a protein in blood plasma that carries hydrophobic substances like fatty acids. This eliminates other options such as transport via red blood cells, combination with oxygen, or as triglycerides, which are incorrect. Albumin is specifically responsible for transporting free fatty acids, making the correct answer:

J: bound to albumin.
