Okay, so I have this problem here about revolving a circle around the z-axis to generate a torus. I'm a bit rusty on my geometry, but let's see if I can work through this.

Alright, the circle C is given by the equation (y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1. It's in the yz-plane, which means that for any point on this circle, the x-coordinate is zero. So this circle is centered at (0, 3, 0) with a radius of 1, right? Because the standard equation for a circle is (y - k)^2 + (z - h)^2 = r^2. So here, k is 3 and h is 0, so center at (0,3,0), radius 1.

Now, the problem says this circle is revolved around the z-axis. Revolving a shape around an axis creates a surface. When you revolve a circle around an axis, you can get different shapes. If you revolve it around an axis that doesn't intersect it, you get a torus. In this case, the circle is in the yz-plane, and we're rotating around the z-axis. So the z-axis is the line x=0, y=0. The circle is at y=3, so the distance from the z-axis (which is the center of the circle's position) is 3 units. So the torus should have a major radius (R) of 3 and a minor radius (r) of 1.

So the equation of a torus can be written in different forms. I remember that the general equation for a torus when revolved around the z-axis is something like (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. Oh right, when you revolve the circle around the z-axis, each point on the circle traces another circle in the x-y plane. So the equation should involve the distance from the z-axis (which is sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) minus the major radius, and then squared plus z squared equals the minor radius squared.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's parameterize the original circle. A point on the circle can be written in parametric form. Let's say theta is the parameter. So for the circle (y-3)^2 + z^2 =1, the parametric equations would be y = 3 + cos(theta), z = sin(theta), and x = 0, right? Because it's in the yz-plane.

When we revolve this circle around the z-axis, each point (0, y, z) will trace a circle in the x-y plane. So for each theta and phi (another parameter for the revolution), the x and y coordinates will change. Let me think: when you rotate (0, y, z) around the z-axis by angle phi, the coordinates become (y sin(phi), y cos(phi), z). Wait, no. The standard rotation around z-axis by phi would take a point (x,y,z) to (x cos phi - y sin phi, x sin phi + y cos phi, z). But here, our point is (0, 3 + cos theta, sin theta). So when rotated by phi, this becomes (- (3 + cos theta) sin phi, (3 + cos theta) cos phi, sin theta).

So the parametric equations for the torus are:

x = - (3 + cos theta) sin phi

y = (3 + cos theta) cos phi

z = sin theta

Hmm, but I'm not sure if I need the parametric form or if I can find the Cartesian equation from that. Let's try to eliminate the parameters theta and phi.

Let me consider the distance from the z-axis. For any point on the torus, the distance from the z-axis is sqrt(x^2 + y^2). From the parametric equations, x^2 + y^2 = ( (3 + cos theta)^2 (sin^2 phi + cos^2 phi) ) = (3 + cos theta)^2.

So sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 3 + cos theta.

But the z-coordinate is sin theta. So cos theta = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -3. Then, using the identity cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta = 1:

( sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -3 )^2 + z^2 = 1.

Expanding this, (x^2 + y^2) - 6 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) + 9 + z^2 = 1.

Wait, but that might not directly help. Alternatively, let's square both sides of sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 3 + cos theta.

So (x^2 + y^2) = (3 + cos theta)^2 = 9 + 6 cos theta + cos^2 theta.

But from the parametric equations, z = sin theta, so cos theta = sqrt(1 - z^2) or -sqrt(1 - z^2). Hmm, that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach. The equation I'm trying to get is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + (z)^2 = r^2, where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. In our case, R is 3 and r is 1. So substituting:

(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -3)^2 + z^2 = 1.

Expanding this:

x^2 + y^2 -6 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) +9 + z^2 =1.

Hmm, that seems messy. Maybe I should square both sides again to eliminate the square root. Let's see.

Let me rearrange the equation:

(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 +9 -1) =6 sqrt(x^2 + y^2).

Wait, wait, let's go back. Wait, when I expand (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -3)^2 + z^2 =1, I get (x^2 + y^2) -6 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) +9 + z^2 =1.

So x^2 + y^2 + z^2 +8 =6 sqrt(x^2 + y^2).

Now, I'll square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 +8)^2 = 36 (x^2 + y^2).

Because (6 sqrt(a))^2 is 36 a.

Looking at the options, option E is (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 +8)^2 =36(x^2 + y^2), which matches what I have here.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 +8)^2 =36(x^2 + z^2)

Option B: ... y^2 + z^2.

Option E: ...36(x^2 + y^2).

So our derived equation is option E.

Wait, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again.

Original circle equation: (y-3)^2 + z^2 =1. When rotated around z-axis, the torus equation is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -3)^2 + z^2 =1.

Expanding that:

x^2 + y^2 -6 sqrt(x^2 + y^2) +9 + z^2 =1.

Combine terms:

x^2 + y^2 + z^2 +8 =6 sqrt(x^2 + y^2).

Square both sides:

(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 +8)^2 =36(x^2 + y^2).

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option E.

The circle \( C \) is given by the equation \( (y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1 \), which is centered at \( (0, 3, 0) \) with a radius of 1. When this circle is revolved around the \( z \)-axis, it generates a torus. The major radius \( R \) of the torus is the distance from the center of the circle to the \( z \)-axis, which is 3, and the minor radius \( r \) is the radius of the circle, which is 1.

The general equation for a torus revolved around the \( z \)-axis is:

\[
\left( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - R \right)^2 + z^2 = r^2
\]

Substituting \( R = 3 \) and \( r = 1 \), the equation becomes:

\[
\left( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 3 \right)^2 + z^2 = 1
\]

Expanding this equation:

\[
x^2 + y^2 - 6 \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + 9 + z^2 = 1
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8 = 6 \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:

\[
\left( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8 \right)^2 = 36 \left( x^2 + y^2 \right)
\]

This matches the equation provided in option E. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: \( \left( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8 \right)^2 = 36 \left( x^2 + y^2 \right) \)**
