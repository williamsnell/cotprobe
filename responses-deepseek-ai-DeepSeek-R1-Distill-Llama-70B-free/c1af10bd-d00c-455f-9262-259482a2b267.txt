Question:

Suppose we are told that an industry is composed of a small number of firms. Can we immediately call this industry oligopolistic? Explain.

Options:

A: An oligopoly is determined solely by the size and number of firms, without considering market dynamics or inter-firm interactions.
B: An oligopoly is indicated by the presence of only government-owned firms in a market.
C: An oligopoly exists when each firm in an industry must contemplate the possible reactions of its rivals in deciding its own behavior.
D: An oligopoly exists when there are few sellers.
E: An oligopoly refers to an industry dominated by a single firm.
F: An oligopoly is present when firms are price takers and have no control over the market price of their goods.
G: An oligopoly is characterized by many small firms that each hold a negligible fraction of the market share.
H: An oligopoly is defined by having a single firm with significant market power, while the rest have very little influence.
I: An oligopoly exists when there are many sellers in a market, each with a differentiated product.
J: An oligopoly is defined by the number of firms in an industry.

Okay, so I have this question about oligopolies, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. The question is asking whether an industry with a small number of firms can automatically be called oligopolistic. I remember that oligopoly is one of the market structures in economics, so I'll start by recalling what I know about that.

Oligopoly, as I remember, is a market structure where a small number of firms produce and sell a product. But wait, is that the only determining factor? I think it's more than just the number of firms. I think it also involves how those firms interact with each other. Like, in an oligopoly, each firm's decisions can affect the others because they're so few. So it's not just about the count.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A says oligopoly is determined solely by the size and number of firms. That doesn't sound right because I remember that market dynamics and how firms interact matter too. So A might not be correct.

Option B mentions only government-owned firms. I don't think oligopoly is about ownership type, so B is probably wrong.

Option C states that each firm must consider its rivals' reactions. That rings a bell. Oligopolies are known for strategic interactions where firms think about how others will respond, so C might be the right answer.

Option D says it exists when there are few sellers. While that's a characteristic, I think it's not the complete picture. So D is partially correct but not the full definition.

Option E refers to a single dominant firm, which sounds more like a monopoly, so E is incorrect.

Option F talks about price takers with no control over prices. That's more like perfect competition, so F is wrong.

Option G describes many small firms with negligible market share. That doesn't fit oligopoly because oligopolies have few firms, not many.

Option H is about a single firm with market power and others with little influence. That seems closer to monopoly or maybe monopolistic competition, not oligopoly.

Option I mentions many sellers with differentiated products. That sounds more like monopolistic competition, so I is incorrect.

Option J defines oligopoly by the number of firms. Like option D, it's a factor but not the whole story. So J is probably wrong.

Wait, the question is whether knowing that there are a small number of firms is enough to call it oligopolistic. The correct answer should explain that it's not just the number, but also the interactions between firms. So looking back, option C says each firm must consider rivals' reactions, which captures that interdependence. So the correct answer should be C.

Another point I remember is that oligopolies can have either collusive or non-collusive behavior. The key is that firms are interdependent, so decisions like pricing or output affect each other. So without considering that interdependence, just having few firms doesn't make it an oligopoly. For example, if the firms act independently without considering each other, maybe it's a different structure, but I don't think that's a standard case.

So the initial thought that the number of firms isn't the only factor seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be C.

To determine whether an industry with a small number of firms can be immediately classified as oligopolistic, it is essential to consider the defining characteristics of an oligopoly. An oligopoly is not solely determined by the number of firms but also involves the strategic interactions and interdependence among those firms. Each firm in an oligopoly must consider the potential reactions of its rivals when making decisions, as their actions can significantly impact market outcomes.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, D, J**: These focus solely on the number of firms, which is insufficient to define an oligopoly.
- **B, E, F, G, H, I**: These describe other market structures or unrelated characteristics.
- **C**: Correctly captures the essence of oligopoly by emphasizing the strategic interdependence among firms.

Thus, the presence of a small number of firms alone does not automatically make an industry oligopolistic; the interdependence and interactions between firms are crucial.

Answer: C
