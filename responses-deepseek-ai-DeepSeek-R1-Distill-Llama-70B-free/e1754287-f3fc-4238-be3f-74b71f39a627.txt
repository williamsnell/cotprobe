Okay, so I've got this problem here where a couple made a deposit on an apartment and then found a better deal. I need to figure out whether they should switch apartments based on the financial aspect. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the initial situation: they paid a non-refundable deposit of $1,000, which is the first month's rent on a 6-month lease. So, they're locked into paying that. Now, the next day, they find another apartment they like just as much, but the rent there is $900 a month. They plan to stay for 6 months too. The question is whether they should switch.

Hmm, so the key here is to compare the total costs of staying in the original apartment versus switching to the new one. But wait, they've already paid $1,000 as a deposit, which is non-refundable. So that's a sunk cost, right? Sunk costs shouldn't influence their future decisions, but sometimes people get emotional about it.

Let me calculate the total rent for each option. In the original apartment, they've already paid $1,000 for the first month. Then, they have 5 more months. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the lease is 6 months. So the deposit is the first month's rent, so they've paid that. So the remaining 5 months would be at $1,000 each? Or wait, no—wait, the deposit is equal to the first month's rent, which is $1,000. So the monthly rent after that is also $1,000. So total for 6 months would be $6,000, but since the first month is already paid, the remaining 5 months would cost 5 * $1,000 = $5,000. So total rent would be $6,000.

Wait, no—wait. Wait, the deposit is the first month's rent, so they've already paid $1,000, and they have to pay the remaining 5 months at $1,000 each. So total is $6,000.

For the new apartment, the rent is $900 a month. So for 6 months, that's 6 * $900 = $5,400. But wait, they haven't paid any deposit there yet. Oh, but wait, they're switching, so they might have to pay another deposit on the new place. Wait, the problem doesn't say anything about a new deposit. Hmm. The question states that they made a non-refundable deposit on the first apartment. It doesn't mention anything about the second apartment's deposit. So perhaps we can assume that the new apartment requires a similar deposit, but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we should ignore that. Or perhaps the question is only considering the deposit they've already lost.

Wait, the question is about whether they should switch. So they have two options: stay in the first apartment or switch to the second.

If they stay, their total cost is the $1,000 deposit plus 5 more months at $1,000 each. So that's $1,000 + 5*$1,000 = $6,000.

If they switch, they lose the $1,000 because it's non-refundable. Then, they have to pay 6 months at $900 each. So that's $1,000 (lost deposit) + 6*$900 = $1,000 + $5,400 = $6,400.

Wait, that can't be right. If they switch, they have to pay the $1,000 they already gave, which they can't get back, plus the new rent. But wait, the new rent is cheaper. Let me calculate again.

Staying: $1,000 (deposit) + 5 * $1,000 = $6,000.

Switching: They lose the $1,000, but then pay 6 * $900 = $5,400. So total is $1,000 + $5,400 = $6,400.

Wait, that would mean switching costs more than staying. But that's not right because the new rent is lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, no. Because if they switch, they are paying the new rent for 6 months, which is $5,400, plus the lost deposit of $1,000, totaling $6,400. Whereas staying, they pay $6,000. So switching would cost them $400 more than staying. But wait, that would mean they shouldn't switch because it's more expensive overall.

Wait, but that can't be correct because the new rent is cheaper. Let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the deposit situation.

Wait, perhaps the initial deposit is for the first month, so they have 5 more months at $1,000 each. So if they switch, they have to pay the new apartment's first month, but maybe the deposit is the same as the first month's rent. So perhaps the new apartment also requires a $900 deposit. But the question doesn't specify any deposit for the new apartment, so I think we can assume that the only cost is the lost deposit of $1,000, and the new rent is $900 per month for 6 months.

Wait, but if they switch, they have to pay the new rent entirely. So the total for switching would be 6 months at $900, which is $5,400, plus the lost $1,000 deposit, making it $6,400. Whereas staying is $6,000. So switching would cost $400 more. That would mean they shouldn't switch because it's more expensive.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because $900 is cheaper. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the $1,000 deposit is the only cost, and then the monthly rent after that is $1,000. So for 6 months, it's $6,000. The new place is $900 per month, but perhaps without any deposit. So 6 months would be $5,400. So the couple would lose the $1,000 but save $600 on the rent (because 6 months * $100 less). So $5,400 - $1,000 = $4,400? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, no. The initial cost is $1,000, and then each month is $1,000. So for 6 months, it's $6,000. The new place is $900 per month, with no upfront deposit mentioned. So 6 months would be $5,400. But since they lose the $1,000, their total cost would be $5,400 + $1,000 = $6,400. So staying would be $6,000, and switching is $6,400. So they pay $400 more by switching. So they should not switch.

Wait, but that's not possible because the new rent is cheaper. Oh wait, maybe I'm including the deposit in the wrong way. Let me try again.

Option 1: Stay. They have already paid $1,000, and they'll pay 5 more months at $1,000 each. So total is $1,000 + 5*$1,000 = $6,000.

Option 2: Switch. They have already lost the $1,000, and they'll have to pay 6 months at $900. So total is $1,000 + 6*$900 = $1,000 + $5,400 = $6,400.

So option 1 is cheaper by $400. So they should not switch.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive because the new rent is cheaper. But when you add the lost deposit, it ends up being more expensive.

So the net difference is $6,400 (switch) - $6,000 (stay) = $400 extra if they switch. So they should not switch.

But the question is asking whether they should switch. So the answer would be no, because it's more expensive when considering the lost deposit.

But wait, another way to look at it is that the sunk cost shouldn't affect their decision. They should only consider future costs. So from now onward, if they stay, they'll pay 5 months at $1,000 each, which is $5,000. If they switch, they'll pay 6 months at $900, which is $5,400. But wait, that would mean that staying would cost $5,000 and switching would cost $5,400, making staying cheaper. But wait, that doesn't include the deposit. Oh, because the deposit is already paid, so it's a sunk cost. So they should ignore it when making the decision.

Wait, this is confusing. So the correct approach is to ignore sunk costs. So the question is, after the deposit, which option is better.

So if they stay, they pay 5 more months at $1,000 = $5,000.

If they switch, they pay 6 months at $900 = $5,400.

So $5,000 versus $5,400. Staying is cheaper. So they should not switch.

But wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. So let's clarify.

Sunk cost: the $1,000 deposit is already spent, regardless of their decision. So they should not let that influence their future decisions.

So the relevant costs are the future rent payments.

If they stay, they have to pay 5 more months at $1,000 each: 5 * 1,000 = $5,000.

If they switch, they have to pay 6 months at $900 each: 6 *900 = $5,400.

So staying would cost them $5,000, switching $5,400. So staying is better.

Wait, that makes sense. So they should not switch because, without considering the sunk cost, staying is cheaper.

But wait, in this case, the difference is $400. So the net benefit of switching would be negative $400.

So the question is whether they should switch. The answer would be no.

But looking at the options, the choices are numerical. The question is, what is the difference in net cost. Wait, the question is, should they switch. But the options are numerical, so perhaps the question is asking about the net gain or loss.

Wait, the question says, should they switch. The options are numerical values, but perhaps it's the net benefit or loss.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the difference in costs.

If they switch, their total cost is $5,400 (new rent) + $1,000 lost deposit = $6,400.

If they stay, their total is $6,000.

So the difference is $6,400 - $6,000 = $400 extra if they switch. So they should not switch, as the net cost is higher.

Alternatively, considering only the future costs (ignoring the sunk deposit), they would pay $5,000 if they stay and $5,400 if they switch. So the difference is $400 more if they switch. So they should not switch.

Thus, the net change would be a loss of $400 if they switch, so the correct answer would be -400. But looking at the options, the options go from -200 to 200, and so on. Wait, the options are A: 0.0, B: -200, C: -100, D:50, etc. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the way I'm calculating the total.

Wait, the initial deposit is $1,000 for the first month. So if they stay, they pay 5 more months at $1,000 each, which is 5,000. So total is 6,000.

If they switch, they have to pay 6 months at $900 each, which is 5,400, plus the lost deposit of 1,000. So total is 6,400.

So the difference is 6,400 (switch) - 6,000 (stay) = 400. So switching would cost them an extra 400.

But the options don't have 400. The highest is J: 200. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the deposit is only the first month's rent, and the monthly rent is the same. So perhaps the deposit isn't an extra cost. Alternatively, perhaps the $1,000 is the deposit, and the monthly rent is $1,000 as well. So for 6 months, it's 6,000.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the couple has only made the deposit, and not yet paid any rent beyond that. So they have five more months to pay, each at $1,000, totaling 5,000, making the total 6,000.

If they switch, they lose the 1,000, and then pay 6 months at 900, which is 5,400. So total cost is 1,000 + 5,400 = 6,400.

So the net difference is 6,400 - 6,000 = 400. So they would spend $400 more by switching. So they should not switch.

But the options don't have 400. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is only considering the difference in rent, not including the deposit. So the deposit is a sunk cost, so they should only compare the future rent.

If that's the case, the future rent if they stay is 5 months at $1,000 = $5,000.

If they switch, the future rent is 6 months at $900 = $5,400.

So the difference is $5,400 - $5,000 = $400 extra if they switch. So they shouldn't switch.

But again, the options don't have 400. So perhaps I've made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the deposit is part of the total rent, so the total for 6 months is 6,000. The new place is 5,400. So the difference is 600 in favor of switching. But they lose the 1,000 deposit, so net is 600 - 1,000 = -400.

So, net loss of 400 if they switch. So the difference is -400, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the difference in monthly rent times the number of months, minus the deposit.

So, the new rent is $100 less per month. For 6 months, that's 6 * 100 = $600 saved. But they lose the $1,000 deposit. So net loss is $400.

So the net change is -$400. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again: the options are from A to J, with B being -200, C being -100, etc. So perhaps the correct answer is B: -200.

Wait, but why? Let me see. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the 6-month lease: if they switch, they have to pay the new apartment's deposit as well. But the problem doesn't mention that. So maybe the new apartment's first month is also a deposit, but since it's cheaper, they would have to pay $900 as a deposit, which they get back when they leave. So perhaps the net loss is only the $1,000 - $900 = $100. But that's if they can get the new deposit back. But the problem doesn't mention anything about deposits on the new apartment.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that they only lose the $1,000 deposit, and the difference in rent is 6 months * $100 = $600. So the net loss would be $1,000 - $600 = $400. So net loss of $400. But again, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the difference in the total rent, not including the deposit. So 6 months at $1,000 is $6,000. 6 months at $900 is $5,400. The difference is $600 saved by switching. But they lose the $1,000 deposit, so net is -$400.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that they've already paid the first month, so they have five months left. So if they switch, they pay 6 months at $900, but they lose the $1,000. So the total for switching is $5,400 + $1,000 = $6,400. The total for staying is $6,000. So the difference is $400, which is a loss if they switch.

So the net change is -$400. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is asking whether they should switch. The options are numbers, so perhaps the correct answer is the net gain or loss.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total cost of each option and choose the one with lower cost.

Option 1: Stay. Total cost is $6,000.

Option 2: Switch. Total cost is $6,400.

So, the net difference is -$400 (a loss), so they shouldn't switch.

But the options don't have -400. The closest is B: -200.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of months. The lease is 6 months. They made the deposit for the first month. So if they switch, they have to pay 5 months at the new place, not 6. Because the first month is already paid in the original place.

Wait, no. If they switch, they have to sign a new lease. So they would have to pay all 6 months at the new place, regardless of the original deposit. So the total would be 6 months * $900 = $5,400, plus the lost $1,000 deposit, making $6,400.

Alternatively, perhaps the lease is only for 6 months, so if they switch, they have to pay the new place for the remaining 5 months. Wait, but no, because they found the new apartment the next day. So they would have to sign a new 6-month lease, paying all 6 months, but the original deposit is lost.

Wait, that can't be right. The timing is that they made the deposit on the first apartment, then the next day found the second. So they have 5 months left on the original lease. But if they switch, they have to take a new lease for 6 months, which would mean overlapping? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the correct approach is that they have to pay the original deposit, and then for the next 5 months, they can choose to pay either $1,000 or $900 per month.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the original lease is 6 months, but if they switch, they would break the lease. But the question doesn't mention any penalties for breaking the lease, only that the deposit is non-refundable. So perhaps they can just switch, and only lose the deposit, but then pay the cheaper rent for the remaining 5 months.

Wait, that changes things. So if they switch, they have to pay 5 months at $900, which is 4,500, plus the lost deposit
