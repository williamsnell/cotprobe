Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem about worker bonuses at K. Industry. Let me read through the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

So, the workers get a bonus if they produce more than 180 micro circuits in a 40-hour workweek. The bonus is 50% of the hours saved. They're paid $2.40 an hour. We have two workers: worker A made 150 circuits, and worker B made 198. The question is asking how much more worker B must be paid than worker A.

Hmm, wait. Wait a second. Wait, the question is a bit confusing. So, the bonus is based on producing more than 180. So, worker A made 150, which is below 180, so they don't get a bonus. Worker B made 198, which is above 180, so they do get a bonus.

So, the total payment for each worker is their regular pay plus any bonus they might have earned. But the question is asking how much more B must be paid than A. So, I think that means we need to calculate the difference in their total payments.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The way the question is phrased: "how much more than worker A must worker B be paid?" So, the difference between B's total pay and A's total pay.

So, first, let me figure out how much each worker is paid, including any bonuses.

Let's break it down step by step.

First, the regular pay. Assuming that each worker works 40 hours, their regular pay would be 40 hours multiplied by $2.40 per hour. That would be 40 * 2.4 = $96 per week, right? So both A and B get $96 as their base pay, unless they get a bonus.

Wait, no. Wait a minute. No, wait. The bonus is based on producing more than 180 circuits. So, the bonus is calculated on the hours saved. So, perhaps the worker's base pay is for 40 hours, but if they finish the work in fewer hours, they get a bonus.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the question again.

 Workers are paid a bonus if they produce more than 180 microcircuits in a 40-hour workweek. The premium is 50% of the hours saved. They are paid $2.40 an hour.

Oh, so the regular pay is for 40 hours. But if they produce more than 180, they get a bonus based on the hours saved. So, perhaps the time it would normally take to produce 180 circuits determines the standard time, and any time saved beyond that allows for a bonus.

Wait, but I'm not given the production rate per hour. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the assumption is that each worker is expected to produce a certain number of circuits per hour. Let's think.

Wait, perhaps the company expects each worker to produce 180 circuits in 40 hours. So, the standard rate is 180 circuits per 40 hours, which is 4.5 circuits per hour. So, if a worker produces more than 180, they've done so in less than 40 hours, thus saving time. The bonus is 50% of the hours saved multiplied by the hourly rate.

Wait, no, the bonus is 50% of the hours saved. So, for each hour saved, the worker gets 50% of that as a bonus. So, for each hour saved beyond the 40, they get 0.5 hours' worth of pay. Since their pay is $2.40 per hour, 0.5 hours would be $1.20 extra per hour saved.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to model this.

Let me define:

For any worker, if they produce N circuits, and N > 180, then they get a bonus. The bonus is 50% of the hours saved. So, the hours saved would be the difference between 40 hours and the time they actually took to produce N circuits. But how is the time calculated?

Wait, perhaps the worker's production rate is based on the number of circuits they produce beyond 180, and the time they save by producing more efficiently.

Wait, maybe the approach is: each worker is expected to produce 180 circuits in 40 hours. So, the standard rate is 180/40 = 4.5 circuits per hour.

If a worker produces more than that, say N circuits, then the time they would have taken at the standard rate is N / 4.5 hours. The time saved is 40 - (N / 4.5). But wait, that can't be right because if N is greater than 180, then N /4.5 would be more than 40, which would imply negative hours saved, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. The time saved is the difference between the standard time (40 hours) and the actual time taken to produce N circuits. But how do we find the actual time?

Wait, perhaps the worker's actual production rate is higher. For example, if a worker makes 198 circuits in 40 hours, their rate is 198/40 = 4.95 circuits per hour, which is higher than the standard 4.5. So, the time saved is the time it would have taken to produce 180 circuits at their actual rate.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as: how much time would it take the worker to produce 180 circuits, given their actual production rate. Then, the difference between 40 hours and that time is the hours saved.

Let me try with worker B, who produced 198 circuits.

Worker B's production rate is 198 circuits / 40 hours = 4.95 circuits per hour.

Time to produce 180 circuits at this rate: 180 / 4.95 = let's calculate that.

180 ÷ 4.95. Let me compute that.

4.95 × 36 = 178.2 → 36 hours would give 178.2 circuits, which is just short of 180. So 180 would be 36 + (1.8/4.95) hours.

Wait, 4.95 * 36 = 178.2. So 180 -178.2=1.8. So 1.8 /4.95 = 0.3636 hours. So total time is 36.3636 hours.

So, time saved = 40 - 36.3636 = 3.6364 hours.

The bonus is 50% of the hours saved, so 0.5 * 3.6364 ≈ 1.8182 hours.

So, the bonus pay would be 1.8182 hours * $2.40 per hour ≈ $4.3636, which is approximately $4.36.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, maybe the bonus is calculated as 50% of the saved hours multiplied by the hourly wage. So, 3.6364 hours saved * 0.5 * $2.40.

Which would be 3.6364 * 0.5 = 1.8182 hours, and 1.8182 * $2.40 = approx $4.36.

So, worker B's total payment would be regular pay ($96) plus bonus ($4.36), totaling $100.36.

Wait, but worker A made 150 circuits. Let's compute worker A's payment.

Worker A's rate is 150 /40 = 3.75 circuits per hour.

Time to produce 180 circuits at this rate: 180 /3.75 = 48 hours.

Wait, but wait, that's impossible because the workweek is only 40 hours. So, worker A didn't meet the 180 target, so they don't get any bonus. So their payment is just the regular 40 hours * $2.40 = $96.

But wait, that can't be right because if worker A's rate is 3.75 per hour, then in 40 hours, they make 150, which is correct. But since they didn't reach 180, they get no bonus. So their total pay is $96.

Worker B made 198 circuits. As calculated, their bonus is about $4.36. So their total pay is $96 + $4.36 = ~$100.36.

So, the difference between B and A is $100.36 - $96 = $4.36.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: $4.80, but that's not exact. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is different. Let me try another approach.

The company's standard is 180 circuits in 40 hours. So, the expected rate is 180/40 = 4.5 circuits per hour.

If a worker produces more than 180, then the time they took is less than 40 hours. The hours saved would be 40 - (time taken). The bonus is 50% of the hours saved, which I think is 50% of the saved hours multiplied by the hourly rate.

Wait, maybe the hours saved is calculated as (40 - (N / (N/40)))? Hmm, that's confusing. Let me think differently.

Wait, if a worker makes N circuits, which is above 180, the time taken would be 40 hours. But perhaps the time saved is the difference between the time it would take to make 180 at their rate and 40 hours.

Wait, let me think again. Let me take worker B's case. They made 198 circuits in 40 hours, so their rate is 198/40 = 4.95 per hour.

The time to make 180 at 4.95 per hour is 180 / 4.95 = 36.3636 hours, as I calculated before. So, the time saved is 40 - 36.3636 = 3.6364 hours.

The bonus is 50% of that, so 1.8182 hours. At $2.40 per hour, that's 1.8182 * 2.40 ≈ $4.36.

So, worker B's total pay is 40 hours * $2.40 = $96 plus $4.36 bonus, totaling $100.36. Worker A's total is $96, so the difference is $4.36. But none of the options exactly match that. The closest option is A: $4.80, but that's not exact. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe the way time saved is calculated is different. Let me consider that the time saved is based on producing 180 circuits. So, for worker B, they made 198 in 40 hours, which is 18 more than 180. So, the extra 18 circuits took them 0 time beyond 40 hours, but actually, since they produced more, perhaps the saved time is calculated based on the extra circuits beyond 180.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The standard time to produce 180 is 40 hours. So, any circuits beyond 180 are produced in less time. So, time saved per extra circuit is 40/(180) hours per circuit, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the bonus is calculated as follows: for each circuit beyond 180, the worker saves (40/180) hours per circuit. So, for each extra circuit, time saved is (40/180)/1 = 2/9 hours per circuit. So, for 198-180=18 extra circuits, time saved is 18*(2/9)=4 hours. So, 4 hours saved. Then, 50% of that is 2 hours. So, bonus is 2*$2.40 = $4.80.

Ah, that would give $4.80 as the bonus, which is option A. So, that makes sense.

Wait, let me verify this approach. So, the time saved per extra circuit is (40 hours)/(180 circuits) = 2/9 hours per circuit. So, for each extra circuit, worker saves 2/9 of an hour. So, for 18 extra circuits, that's 18*(2/9) = 4 hours saved. The bonus is 50% of that, which is 2 hours. At $2.40 per hour, that's $4.80.

So, worker B's total pay is $96 + $4.80 = $100.80.

Worker A made 150, which is below 180, so no bonus. So, A's pay is $96.

The difference is $100.80 - $96 = $4.80. So the answer would be option A: $4.80.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated using the rate, I got approximately $4.36. There's a discrepancy here. So which approach is correct?

Hmm, perhaps the method of using the standard rate is more accurate. Because that approach calculates the exact time saved based on the worker's actual production rate.

Wait, but according to the first method, worker B's bonus was about $4.36, but according to the second method, it's $4.80. So which one is correct?

Let me think again. The problem states that the bonus is 50% of the hours saved. So, perhaps the hours saved are calculated as the difference between 40 hours and the time taken to produce exactly 180 circuits at the worker's actual production rate.

So, for worker B, their rate is 198/40 = 4.95 per hour. So, time to produce 180 is 180/4.95 = 36.3636 hours. So, time saved is 40 - 36.3636 = 3.6364 hours. So, 50% of that is 1.8182 hours, which is 1.8182 * $2.40 = $4.36.

But that doesn't match any of the options except perhaps option A is $4.80. Wait, option A is $4.80, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the time saved.

Wait, maybe the hours saved are calculated as the difference between the standard time (40 hours) and the actual time taken to produce N circuits, where N is greater than 180.

Wait, but in worker B's case, they took 40 hours to produce 198, so the actual time to produce 180 would be (180/198)*40 = (180/198)*40. Let me compute that.

180/198 = 0.909090... So, 0.909090... *40 = 36.3636 hours, same as before. So, time saved is 3.6364 hours. So, 50% of that is 1.8182 hours. So, bonus is 1.8182 * 2.40 = $4.36.

But none of the options is exactly $4.36. So perhaps the correct approach is the second method, which gives $4.80.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me review the problem statement again.

The workers are paid a bonus if they produce more than 180 microcircuits in a 40-hour workweek. The premium is 50% of the hours saved. So, perhaps the 'hours saved' refers to the time saved beyond the 40-hour workweek. But if the worker took fewer than 40 hours to produce 180, then the saved hours would be the difference, but since the workweek is 40 hours, perhaps the saved hours are calculated as 40 minus the time taken to make 180 at the worker's higher production rate.

Wait, perhaps another way: The standard time to make 180 is 40 hours. If a worker makes N circuits in 40 hours, where N > 180, then the time saved is the time it would have taken to make N circuits at the standard rate (4.5 per hour), minus 40 hours.

Wait, that might be another approach. Let me try that.

Standard rate: 4.5 circuits per hour.

Worker B's production: 198 circuits in 40 hours.

Time to produce 198 at standard rate: 198 /4.5 = 44 hours.

So, by producing 198 in 40 hours, worker B saved 44 -40 = 4 hours.

So, hours saved =4. Then, 50% of 4 hours is 2 hours. So, bonus is 2 * $2.40 = $4.80.

Ah, that gives $4.80, which is option A.

So, according to this method, worker B's bonus is $4.80. So, their total payment is $96 + $4.80 = $100.80.

Worker A made 150, which is below 180, so no bonus. So, A's payment is $96.

The difference is $100.80 - $96 = $4.80. So, the answer is option A: $4.80.

Wait, but in this approach, the hours saved are calculated as the time it would have taken at the standard rate minus the actual time. So, yes, that gives 4 hours saved. So, 50% of 4 is 2 hours, which is $4.80.

I think this approach makes more sense because it's based on the standard rate. So, the correct answer is option A: $4.80.
</think>

The workers at "K. Industry" are paid a bonus if they produce more than 180 microcircuits in a 40-hour workweek. The bonus is calculated as 50% of the hours saved, where the hours saved are the difference between the standard time (40 hours) and the actual time taken to produce the circuits at the worker's production rate. The regular pay is $2.40 per hour, and the total payment includes the regular pay plus any bonus.

### Worker A:
- Worker A produced 150 circuits, which is below the threshold of 180 circuits.
- Therefore, Worker A does not qualify for a bonus.
- Total payment for Worker A:  
  \[
  40 \, \text{hours} \times \$2.40/\text{hour} = \$96
  \]

### Worker B:
- Worker B produced 198 circuits in 40 hours.
- To calculate the bonus, first determine the time saved:
  - Standard production rate: \( 180 \, \text{circuits} / 40 \, \text{hours} = 4.5 \, \text{circuits/hour} \).
  - Time to produce 198 circuits at the standard rate:  
    \[
    198 \, \text{circuits} / 4.5 \, \text{circuits/hour} = 44 \, \text{hours}
    \]
  - Actual time taken: 40 hours.
  - Hours saved: \( 44 - 40 = 4 \, \text{hours} \).
- Bonus is 50% of the hours saved:  
  \[
  0.5 \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 2 \, \text{hours}
