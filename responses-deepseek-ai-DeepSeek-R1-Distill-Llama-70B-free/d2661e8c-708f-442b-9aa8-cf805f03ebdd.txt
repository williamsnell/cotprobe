Okay, so I've got this accounting question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me take it step by step. 

The question is about what happens when Corporation X pays out $300,000 in salaries. I remember that in accounting, every transaction affects at least two accounts because of the double-entry system. So paying salaries would involve an expense and a change in assets or liabilities.

Let me think about what's happening when a company pays salaries. Salaries are an expense, right? So when the company pays its employees, they're incurring a salary expense. That would mean the salary expense account should increase because expenses are recorded when incurred, regardless of when the payment happens. But wait, in this case, the payment is happening, so maybe it's when the expense is recognized.

Wait, no, actually, when you pay salaries, if the company has already accrued the expense in a previous period, then paying it now would just be settling the liability. But if the payment is happening in the same period as the expense, then the expense is recorded at the same time as the cash payment.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the accounts involved. Paying salaries would decrease the cash account because cash is going out. At the same time, the expense (salary expense) would increase because the company is using up that resource (the employees' work) to generate revenue.

So the two accounts affected would be Cash (an asset) decreasing by $300,000 and Salary Expense increasing by $300,000. But wait, where does the liability come into play? Oh, right, if the salaries were accrued as a liability before being paid. For example, if at the end of the previous month, the company owed salaries to employees, that would be a liability (like Salaries Payable). When they pay the salaries, they're decreasing that liability.

Wait, but the question says "when Corporation X pays out $300,000 in salaries." So I think that means they are paying the liability. So prior to this payment, there was a liability account (say, Salaries Payable) that had a credit balance. Paying the salaries would debit that liability account, decreasing it, and credit Cash, decreasing it as well. But wait, no, paying with cash would be a debit to Cash (since cash is an asset and is being used, so it's decreased), and a credit to the liability account, which decreases it.

Wait, no, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. When you pay salaries, cash goes down (so Cash is debited), and the liability (like Salaries Payable) is also reduced (so credited). So the two entries would be:

Debit Salary Expense $300,000
Credit Cash $300,000

Wait, no, that's if you're recording the expense when you pay. But when a company incurs the expense, they might have already recorded it as an accrual. So if the payment is made, it's just settling the liability.

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of whether the expense was previously recorded. If the company pays salaries in the same period they're incurred, then the entry would be:

Debit Salary Expense $300,000
Credit Cash $300,000

This would increase the expense and decrease cash. So looking at the options, I'm looking for an option where Salary Expense increases by $300k and Cash decreases by $300k.

Looking at the options:

Option I: Salary expense increased by $300k; cash decreased by $300k. That seems to match.

Wait, what were the options again?

Option G: Salary expense up, assets down. Hmm, but which asset? Cash is an asset, so if cash is down $300k, that's correct. So G says Salary expense increased by $300k, assets decreased by $300k. But which asset? Because if cash is the asset being decreased, then the correct option would be G. But I thought the option I was correct.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me go back.

When you pay salaries, the effect is that Cash (asset) decreases by $300k, and Salary Expense (an expense) increases by $300k. So the accounts affected are Cash (asset) and Salary Expense (expense). Alternatively, if the salaries were previously accrued as a liability, then Cash would decrease, and the liability would decrease.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify whether the salaries were accrued before or not. It just says "when Corporation X pays out $300,000 in salaries." So perhaps they had a liability account before this payment.

In that case, the payment would decrease Cash (debit) and decrease the liability (credit). But the options don't all reflect that. For example, option I says Salary expense is increased, which would be if the expense was being recorded now. But if the expense was already recorded in a prior period when the salaries were accrued, then paying now would not affect the expense, only decrease the liability and cash.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think again. The question is about the impact on assets and liabilities. So, when the company pays the salaries, it's using cash (so assets go down by $300k). If the salaries were an accrued liability before, then the liability (like Salaries Payable) would decrease by $300k as well. So in that case, assets (cash) decrease by $300k, and liabilities decrease by $300k.

But none of the options directly say that. Let me check the options again.

Option E: Assets decreased by $300k; liabilities increased by $300k. That doesn't fit, because if you pay a liability, liabilities would decrease, not increase.

Option G: Salary expense up, assets down. So if Salary Expense is increased, that would be an expense, which affects equity. But the question is about assets and liabilities. So perhaps that's not the right way to look.

Wait, the options might be considering the accounts more directly. Let me re-examine the options:

Option I: Salary expense increased by $300k; cash decreased by $300k.

Option G: Salary expense increased by $300k; assets decreased by $300k.

Wait, in terms of the accounts, paying salaries would mean:

- Cash (asset) decreases by $300k.

- Salary Expense (expense) increases by $300k, if the expense is being recognized now. Or,

- If the expense was accrued before, then Salaries Payable (liability) decreases by $300k.

So the question is, what is the impact on assets and liabilities. So if the payment is made from a cash basis, then Cash (asset) decreases by $300k. If the company had a liability before (like Salaries Payable), then that liability decreases by $300k. So overall, assets down $300k, liabilities down $300k.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option where both assets and liabilities decrease. Let me check the options again.

Looking through the options:

A: Assets up $300k; liabilities down $300k. That doesn't fit.

B: Salary expense down; cash up. No, that's wrong.

C: Assets up; cash down. That doesn't make sense.

D: Salary expense down; liabilities up. No.

E: Assets down; liabilities up. No, opposite of what we expect.

F: Salary expense up; liabilities down. Hmm, but assets?

G: Salary expense up; assets down. So if assets are down $300k (cash), and salary expense up. But what about liabilities? In this case, if the liability was already there, paying it would decrease liability. But if the payment is made without a prior accrual, then there's no change in liability, only cash down and expense up.

Wait, maybe I'm making this more complicated. The question is, when they pay the salaries, what happens. So, regardless of whether it was accrued before, the act of paying would decrease cash (asset) and either decrease a liability or increase an expense, depending on prior entries.

But in the case of paying salaries, the immediate effect is cash outflow (asset down) and expense recognized (expense up), assuming that the expense wasn't previously recorded.

Wait, but in reality, when a company pays salaries, they typically do so after the expense has been accrued. So, for example, at the end of the month, they would record the salary expense and the corresponding liability. Then, when they pay the following month, they debit the liability and credit cash. So in that case, the expense was already recorded in the prior period. Thus, paying the liability would only affect cash and the liability account.

But the question doesn't specify whether the payment is for an accrued expense or not. So perhaps the question is considering the case where the expense is being recorded now, along with the cash payment.

In that case, the two accounts affected would be Salary Expense (increased by $300k) and Cash (decreased by $300k). So looking at the options, option I says "Salary expense increased by $300k; cash decreased by $300k." That would be the correct one.

Alternatively, if the expense had been accrued, the payment would decrease Cash and decrease the liability. But in that scenario, the question would probably mention that the salaries were payable or something. Since it's just about paying, I think the intended answer is that the expense is recognized, and cash is paid.

So the correct option is I.
</think>

When Corporation X pays out $300,000 in salaries, the transaction involves two key accounts: **Salary Expense** and **Cash**. Paying salaries results in a decrease in **Cash** (an asset) by $300,000 because cash is being paid out. Simultaneously, **Salary Expense** increases by $300,000 because the expense is being recognized at the time of payment.

The question does not specify whether the salaries were accrued as a liability in a previous period. If the expense was already accrued, paying the salaries would decrease both **Cash** and the liability account (e.g., Salaries Payable). However, the question appears to focus on the direct impact of the payment, where the expense is recognized and cash is reduced.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option I**: "Salary expense is increased by $300,000; cash is decreased by $300,000." This matches the scenario where the expense is recognized, and cash is reduced due to the payment.
- Other options either incorrectly describe the direction of changes (e.g., increasing assets or decreasing expenses) or misrepresent the accounts affected.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option I**, as it accurately reflects the increase in **Salary Expense** and the decrease in **Cash** when Corporation X pays out the salaries.

Answer: I
