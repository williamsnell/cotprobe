Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the molar solubility of Iron(III) hydroxide. Hmm, I remember that solubility product, Ksp, is involved here. Let me think about how to approach this.

Iron(III) hydroxide is Fe(OH)3, right? So when it dissolves in water, it dissociates into ions. The dissociation equation should be Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe³+ (aq) + 3OH⁻ (aq). Yeah, that makes sense because each formula unit gives one Fe³+ and three OH⁻ ions.

The Ksp expression for this would then be Ksp = [Fe³+][OH⁻]^3. Oh wait, yes, because the concentration of OH- is cubed since there are three moles of OH- per formula unit.

Let me denote the molar solubility of Fe(OH)3 as 's'. So when it dissolves, the concentration of Fe³+ would be 's', and the concentration of OH⁻ would be 3s, because each mole of Fe(OH)3 releases three OH- ions. Wait no, wait a second. Oh no, wait! Actually, no. Wait, for every mole of Fe(OH)3 that dissolves, you get one mole of Fe³+ and three moles of OH⁻. So [Fe³+] is s, and [OH⁻] is 3s. So the Ksp expression would be Ksp = s * (3s)^3.

Let me write that out: Ksp = s * (3s)^3 = s * 27s^3 = 27s^4. Oh, that's right. So 27s^4 equals the Ksp value given, which is 1.6 × 10^-39.

So I need to solve for s. Let's set up the equation:

27s^4 = 1.6e-39

To solve for s, I'll divide both sides by 27:

s^4 = (1.6e-39) / 27

Let me compute that. 1.6 divided by 27 is approximately 0.05926. So 0.05926e-39. But wait, 1.6 /27 is actually 0.059259... So 5.9259e-2 multiplied by 1e-39 gives 5.9259e-41.

So s^4 = 5.9259e-41.

Taking the fourth root of both sides to solve for s. The fourth root is the square root of the square root. Alternatively, I can write it as s = (5.9259e-41)^(1/4).

Let me compute this step by step. First, find the square root of 5.9259e-41.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to express it in terms of exponents. Let me think in exponents.

s^4 = 5.9259e-41 → take natural logs: ln(s^4) = ln(5.9259e-41)

4 ln s = ln(5.9259) + ln(1e-41) 

ln(5.9259) is about 1.78, and ln(1e-41) is -41 ln(10), which is about -41 *2.3026 ≈ -94.41. So total is 1.78 -94.41 ≈ -92.63.

So ln s = (-92.63)/4 ≈ -23.1575.

Now exponentiate both sides: s = e^(-23.1575). Let me compute that. Hmm, e^23 is about 1e10, because e^10 is about 22026, e^20 is ~4.8e8, e^23 is roughly 1e10?

Wait, more accurately, e^23.1575. Let me think. Let's compute e^23.1575 first.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, because it's e^(-23.1575) which is 1 / e^(23.1575). So I can calculate e^23.1575.

But perhaps I can use logarithm tables or approximate. Alternatively, I can compute the fourth root numerically.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the fourth root of 5.9259e-41.

Let me write 5.9259e-41 as (some number)^(4). Let me break it down.

Let me think about 1e-40. The fourth root of 1e-40 is (1e-40)^(1/4) = (1e-40)^(0.25) = 1e-10, because 1e-40 is (1e-10)^4.

Wait, 1e-10 to the fourth is 1e-40. So the fourth root of 1e-40 is 1e-10. But our number is 5.9259e-41, which is 0.59259e-40. So slightly less than 1e-40.

So the fourth root of 5.9259e-41 is a bit less than 1e-10. Let's find x where x^4 = 5.9259e-41.

Let me compute 9e-11: (9e-11)^4 = 9^4 *1e-44 = 6561e-44=6.561e-41. Oh, wait that's more than 5.9259e-41.

Hmm, so 9e-11 gives 6.56e-41. But we need 5.9259e-41. So perhaps 8.8e-11.

Let me compute (8.8e-11)^4.

8.8^4: 8^4 is 4096, but 8.8 is bigger. Let me compute 8.8 *8.8 = 77.44. Then 77.44 *8.8 = 681.472. Then 681.472 *8.8 = Let's see, 680*8=5440, 680*0.8=544, 1.472*8=11.776, 1.472*0.8=1.1776. So approximately, 5440 +544=5984, 11.776 +1.1776≈12.95. So total approx 5984 +12.95=5996.95. So 8.8^4≈5997.

So (8.8e-11)^4 = 5997e-44 = 5.997e-41, which is very close to 5.9259e-41. So s is approximately 8.8e-11 M.

Looking at the options, option B is 8.8 × 10^-11 M. So that's the answer.

To determine the molar solubility of Iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)₃, we start with its dissociation in water:

\[
\text{Fe(OH)}_3(s) \leftrightharpoons \text{Fe}^{3+}(aq) + 3\text{OH}^-(aq)
\]

Let the molar solubility of Fe(OH)₃ be \( s \). From the dissociation, the concentration of \(\text{Fe}^{3+}\) is \( s \), and the concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) is \( 3s \). The solubility product expression is:

\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Fe}^{3+}][\text{OH}^-]^3 = s(3s)^3 = 27s^4
\]

Given \( K_{sp} = 1.6 \times 10^{-39} \), we solve for \( s \):

\[
27s^4 = 1.6 \times 10^{-39}
\]

\[
s^4 = \frac{1.6 \times 10^{-39}}{27} \approx 5.9259 \times 10^{-41}
\]

Taking the fourth root of both sides:

\[
s = (5.9259 \times 10^{-41})^{1/4}
\]

Approximating, the fourth root of \( 5.9259 \times 10^{-41} \) is slightly less than \( 1 \times 10^{-10} \). Testing \( s = 8.8 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
(8.8 \times 10^{-11})^4 = 5.997 \times 10^{-41}
\]

This is very close to \( 5.9259 \times 10^{-41} \), confirming that \( s \approx 8.8 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{M} \).

Thus, the molar solubility of Fe(OH)₃ is \( 8.8 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option **B**.
