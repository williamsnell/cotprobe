Okay, so I've got this problem about simple harmonic motion, and I need to figure out the correct answers among the options provided. Let's take it step by step.

The equation given is y = 4 sin[(2πt/6) + α]. So first, I'll try to understand each part. The general SHM equation is y = A sin(ωt + α), where A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and α is the phase angle at t=0.

From the equation, the amplitude A is 4. The angular frequency ω is 2π/6, which simplifies to π/3. So ω = π/3 rad/s.

Now, the problem has four parts to solve: (a), (b), (c), and (d). Let's tackle each one.

(a) Phase angle when t=0:
At t=0, the displacement y is given as +1 unit. Plugging t=0 into the equation:

y = 4 sin(0 + α) → 1 = 4 sin α → sin α = 1/4 → α = sin⁻¹(1/4).

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them seem to directly state this. Let me compute sin⁻¹(0.25). Let me think, sin(π/12) is about 0.2588, which is close to 0.25. Hmm, but wait, π/12 is 15 degrees. 0.25 is a bit less than that. Alternatively, perhaps the options use exact expressions, but maybe I should think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. The equation is y = 4 sin( (2πt/6) + α ). At t=0, y=1, so:

1 = 4 sin(α) → sin(α) = 1/4 → α = sin⁻¹(1/4). But none of the options directly show this. Let me check the options given.

Looking at the options for part (a):

Option A: π/6 → about 0.523 rad
Option B: π/2 → 1.57 rad
Option C: π/8 → ~0.3927 rad
Option D: π/6 → same as A
Option E: π/12.4 → approx 0.254 rad
Option F: π/10 → ~0.314 rad
Option G: π/3 → ~1.047 rad
Option H: π/12.4 → same as E
Option I: π/24.8 → ~0.127 rad
Option J: π/4 → ~0.785 rad.

Hmm, none of these options directly match sin⁻¹(0.25), which is approximately 0.2527 radians (about 14.47 degrees). So perhaps I'm missing something here. Wait, perhaps I should consider that in the equation, the phase is already included, so maybe the phase angle at t=0 is α as given, but perhaps the equation is written differently. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the equation.

Wait another thought: maybe the equation is y = 4 sin( (2πt)/6 + α ), which is the same as y=4 sin( (π t)/3 + α ). So yes, that's correct.

So, when t=0, y=1. So 1=4 sin(α) → sin α = 0.25 → α = sin⁻¹(0.25). Let me calculate that: 0.2527 radians, which is approximately π/12.566, since π is about 3.1416, so π/12.566 is roughly 0.25. So, perhaps the closest option is E or H, which have π/12.4, which is about 0.254 radians. Let me compute π/12.4: 3.1416 / 12.4 ≈ 0.253 radians. Which is very close to 0.2527. So, option E and H have α as π/12.4.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Looking at the options, part (a) is the phase angle at t=0, which is α. So for option B, the phase angle is π/2, which is way bigger. So perhaps options E and H are the candidates. But let me proceed to the other parts before deciding.

(b) Difference in phase between any two positions 2 seconds apart.

The phase difference is the change in the argument of the sine function over 2 seconds. The angular frequency ω is π/3 rad/s. So in 2 seconds, the change in phase is Δφ = ω * Δt = (π/3) * 2 = 2π/3 radians. To convert to degrees, 2π/3 is 120 degrees. So the phase difference is 120 degrees.

Looking at the options, let's see which ones have 120 degrees for part (b). Option H says 120 degrees. Option B says 150, which is larger. Option E says 60 degrees, which is half of 120, so that's not it. So the phase difference is 120 degrees, which points towards option H. But wait, let me check the other options.

Wait, option H's part (a) is π/12.4, which matches the α we calculated. But let's see other parts. Let's proceed.

(c) Phase angle corresponding to a displacement of +2.

The equation is y =4 sin(φ), where φ is the phase (ωt + α). So when y=+2, 2=4 sin φ → sin φ = 0.5 → φ = π/6 or 5π/6 (30° or 150°). But since the question asks for the phase angle corresponding to that displacement, perhaps it's the principal value. So the phase would be π/6 or 30 degrees.

Looking at the options for part (c):

Option H says 30 degrees. Option E also says 15 degrees. Wait, no. Let me check each option.

Option A: 60 degrees
Option B:37.5
Option C:11.25
Option D:15
Option E:15
Option F:75
Option G:45
Option H:30
Option I:60
Option J:22.5

So in part (c), the correct answer is 30 degrees or π/6. So option H has 30 degrees. So that matches.

(d) Time to reach a displacement of +3 from the initial position.

Wait, initial position is at t=0, where y=1. So the displacement from the initial position would be y - y_initial = 3 - 1 = 2 units. Or perhaps the question is asking about the time to reach a displacement of +3 units, regardless of the initial position. Wait, the question says "displacement of +3 from the initial position." So that implies that the displacement is 3 units in the positive direction, starting from the initial position, which was at +1. So the change in displacement is 2 units. But perhaps I should read it again.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the equation is y=4 sin(φ). So the maximum displacement is +4 when sin φ=1. So to reach +3, which is less than the maximum, so that's possible.

So when does y=3? So 3=4 sin φ → sin φ=3/4 → φ= sin⁻¹(3/4). Let's compute that: sin⁻¹(0.75) is approximately 0.84806 radians, or about 48.59 degrees. But considering the periodicity, the general solution would be φ = 0.84806 + 2nπ or φ = π - 0.84806 + 2nπ, for integer n.

But since we're looking for the time taken to reach this from t=0, we can take the smallest positive time. So we can model φ as ωt + α = 0.84806.

We have ω=π/3, so:

(π/3) t + α = 0.84806 → t = [0.84806 - α] * 3 / π.

But wait, from part (a), α is approximately 0.2527 radians. So substituting:

0.84806 - 0.2527 ≈ 0.59536 radians.

t ≈ 0.59536 * 3 / π → 1.78608 / 3.1416 ≈ 0.569 seconds. Approximately 0.57 seconds.

Looking at the options, part (d) is the time to reach +3. Let's check the options:

Option H: 0.57 seconds. So that matches.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me calculate this more accurately.

Given that α = sin⁻¹(1/4) ≈ 0.2527 rad.

So when y=3, 3=4 sin φ → φ ≈ 0.84806 rad.

So the equation is (π/3) t + α = 0.84806 → t = (0.84806 - 0.2527) * 3/π → (0.59536) * (3/π).

Calculating 0.59536 *3 = 1.78608. Divided by π (≈3.1416) → 1.78608 /3.1416 ≈ 0.569 seconds, which rounds to 0.57 seconds as in option H.

So putting it all together:

(a) α ≈ 0.253 rad → option H has π/12.4 ≈0.253 rad.

(b) Phase difference in 2 seconds is 120 degrees.

(c) Phase angle for y=2 is 30 degrees.

(d) Time to reach y=3 is 0.57 seconds.

Looking at option H:

(a) Phase angle at t=0: π/12.4 radians → correct.

(b) Phase difference: 120 degrees → correct.

(c) Phase angle for +2: 30 degrees → correct.

(d) Time: 0.57 seconds → correct.

So option H seems to match all parts. Wait, let me check the other options to be sure.

Looking at option E:

(a) π/12.4 → correct.

(b) 60 degrees → no, because we calculated 120.

So option E is out.

Option B:

(a) π/2 → no.

Option H is the only one that matches all four parts correctly.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given simple harmonic motion equation:

\[
y = 4 \sin\left(\frac{2\pi t}{6} + \alpha\right) = 4 \sin\left(\frac{\pi t}{3} + \alpha\right),
\]

where \(A = 4\) (amplitude) and \(\omega = \frac{\pi}{3}\) (angular frequency). The problem has four parts:

---

### (a) Phase angle at \(t = 0\):
At \(t = 0\), the displacement \(y = +1\). Substituting into the equation:

\[
1 = 4 \sin(\alpha) \implies \sin(\alpha) = \frac{1}{4} \implies \alpha = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right).
\]

Using \(\sin^{-1}(0.25) \approx 0.2527\) radians, which is approximately \(\frac{\pi}{12.4}\). Thus, the phase angle at \(t = 0\) is \(\frac{\pi}{12.4}\).

---

### (b) Difference in phase between two positions 2 seconds apart:
The phase difference over time is given by \(\Delta \phi = \omega \Delta t\). Substituting \(\omega = \frac{\pi}{3}\) and \(\Delta t = 2\):

\[
\Delta \phi = \frac{\pi}{3} \cdot 2 = \frac{2\pi}{3} \, \text{radians} = 120^\circ.
\]

Thus, the phase difference between two positions 2 seconds apart is \(120^\circ\).

---

### (c) Phase angle corresponding to a displacement of \(+2\):
For \(y = +2\), we substitute into the equation:

\[
2 = 4 \sin(\phi) \implies \sin(\phi) = \frac{1}{2} \implies \phi = \frac{\pi}{6} \, \text{radians} = 30^\circ.
\]

Thus, the phase angle corresponding to a displacement of \(+2\) is \(30^\circ\).

---

### (d) Time to reach a displacement of \(+3\) from the initial position:
For \(y = +3\), we substitute into the equation:

\[
3 = 4 \sin(\phi) \implies \sin(\phi) = \frac{3}{4} \implies \phi = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right).
\]

Using \(\sin^{-1}(0.75) \approx 0.84806\) radians. The equation for \(\phi\) is:

\[
\phi = \omega t + \alpha \implies 0.84806 = \frac{\pi}{3}t + 0.2527.
\]

Solving for \(t\):

\[
t = \frac{0.84806 - 0.2527}{\frac{\pi}{3}} \approx \frac{0.59536}{1.0472} \approx 0.57 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

Thus, the time to reach a displacement of \(+3\) is approximately \(0.57\) seconds.

---

### Final Answer:
From the analysis above, the correct option is:

**H:**
- (a) Phase angle at \(t = 0\): \(\frac{\pi}{12.4}\) radians.
- (b) Phase difference between two positions 2 seconds apart: \(120^\circ\).
- (c) Phase angle corresponding to a displacement of \(+2\): \(30^\circ\).
- (d) Time to reach a displacement of \(+3\): \(0.57\) seconds.
