Okay, so I'm trying to solve this differential equation problem. The question is about an initial value problem: 4y'' - y = 0, with y(0) = 2 and y'(0) = β. I need to find the value of β such that the solution y(t) approaches zero as t approaches infinity.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I remember that this is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation. The standard approach for such equations is to find the characteristic equation and then the general solution.

The equation given is 4y'' - y = 0. Let's rewrite this as 4y'' = y, which suggests dividing both sides by 4 to get y'' = (1/4)y. Wait, no, actually, the standard form is ay'' + by' + cy = 0. So in this case, the equation is 4y'' - y = 0, which can be written as 4y'' + 0y' - y = 0. So a=4, b=0, c=-1.

The characteristic equation for such a DE is ar² + br + c = 0. So substituting the values, I get 4r² -1 =0. Wait, wait, because in the equation 4y'' - y =0, so the coefficients are 4, 0, -1. So the characteristic equation is 4r² -1 =0. 

Solving 4r² -1 =0: 4r² =1 → r²=1/4 → r = ±1/2. Oh wait, no, wait: 4r²=1 → r²=1/4 → r=±(1/2). So the roots are real and distinct, right?

Wait a second, no, wait: 4r² =1 → r² = 1/4 → r = 1/2 and r= -1/2. So two real roots, r1=1/2, r2=-1/2.

So the general solution to the differential equation is y(t) = C1 * e^{(1/2)t} + C2 * e^{(-1/2)t}, where C1 and C2 are constants determined by initial conditions.

Wait, but wait a moment. The equation is 4y'' - y =0, so when I rewrite it as y'' = (1/4)y. So the general solution is y(t) = C1 e^{(1/2)t} + C2 e^{-(1/2)t}.

But wait, another thought: The general solution when you have roots like r1 and r2 is y(t) = C1 e^{r1 t} + C2 e^{r2 t}. So that's correct.

Now, the initial conditions are y(0)=2 and y'(0)=β. Let's apply them.

First, y(0) = 2.

Plugging t=0 into y(t): y(0) = C1 e^0 + C2 e^0 → C1 + C2 = 2.

Next, find y'(t). The derivative of y(t) is y'(t) = (C1 * (1/2)) e^{(1/2)t} + (C2 * (-1/2)) e^{(-1/2)t}.

At t=0, y'(0) = (C1*(1/2)) *1 + (C2*(-1/2)) *1 → (C1/2) - (C2/2) = β.

So now we have a system of two equations:

1) C1 + C2 = 2
2) (C1 - C2)/2 = β

We can solve for C1 and C2 in terms of β, but perhaps it's easier to express C2 in terms of C1 from equation 1: C2 = 2 - C1.

Substituting into equation 2: (C1 - (2 - C1))/2 = β → (2C1 - 2)/2 = β → (C1 -1) = β.

So C1 = β +1.

But then, C2 = 2 - C1 = 2 - (β +1) = 1 - β.

So the solution becomes y(t) = (β +1) e^{(1/2)t} + (1 - β) e^{-(1/2)t}.

Now, the question is to find β such that y(t) approaches zero as t approaches infinity.

Let's think about the behavior of each term as t→infty.

e^{(1/2)t} grows exponentially as t increases, because (1/2) is positive. On the other hand, e^{-(1/2)t} decays to zero as t increases.

So for y(t) to approach zero as t→infty, the coefficient of the growing exponential term must be zero. Because if (β +1) is not zero, then y(t) will blow up to infinity, not approach zero.

Therefore, we must set the coefficient of e^{(1/2)t} to zero.

So, β +1 = 0 → β = -1.

Wait, that's the key point. So β must be -1.

Let me double-check that. If β = -1, then C1 = 0, and C2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

So the solution becomes y(t) = 0 * e^{(1/2)t} + 2 * e^{-(1/2)t} → y(t) = 2 e^{-t/2}.

As t→infty, e^{-t/2} approaches zero, so y(t) approaches zero, which is what we want.

If β wasn't -1, then C1 would be non-zero, leading to a term that grows without bound, making y(t)→infty, which is not desired. So β must be -1.

Looking at the options, option J is -1.

To solve the initial value problem \( 4y'' - y = 0 \), with \( y(0) = 2 \) and \( y'(0) = \beta \), we first recognize that this is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation. The characteristic equation is obtained by assuming a solution of the form \( y(t) = e^{rt} \), leading to:

\[
4r^2 - 1 = 0 \implies r^2 = \frac{1}{4} \implies r = \pm \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Thus, the general solution is:

\[
y(t) = C_1 e^{(1/2)t} + C_2 e^{-(1/2)t},
\]

where \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \) are constants determined by the initial conditions.

### Applying Initial Conditions
1. **\( y(0) = 2 \):**
   Substituting \( t = 0 \) into \( y(t) \), we get:
   \[
   C_1 + C_2 = 2.
   \]

2. **\( y'(0) = \beta \):**
   The derivative of \( y(t) \) is:
   \[
   y'(t) = \frac{C_1}{2} e^{(1/2)t} - \frac{C_2}{2} e^{-(1/2)t}.
   \]
   At \( t = 0 \), this becomes:
   \[
   \frac{C_1}{2} - \frac{C_2}{2} = \beta \implies C_1 - C_2 = 2\beta.
   \]

From the two equations:
1. \( C_1 + C_2 = 2 \),
2. \( C_1 - C_2 = 2\beta \),

we solve for \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \):
\[
C_1 = \beta + 1, \quad C_2 = 1 - \beta.
\]

Thus, the solution becomes:
\[
y(t) = (\beta + 1) e^{(1/2)t} + (1 - \beta) e^{-(1/2)t}.
\]

### Behavior as \( t \to \infty \)
As \( t \to \infty \), the term \( e^{(1/2)t} \) grows exponentially, while \( e^{-(1/2)t} \) decays to zero. For \( y(t) \) to approach zero, the coefficient of the growing term \( e^{(1/2)t} \) must be zero. This requires:
\[
\beta + 1 = 0 \implies \beta = -1.
\]

If \( \beta = -1 \), the solution simplifies to:
\[
y(t) = 2 e^{-(1/2)t},
\]
which indeed approaches zero as \( t \to \infty \).

### Final Answer
The value of \( \beta \) that ensures the solution approaches zero as \( t \to \infty \) is \( \beta = -1 \).
