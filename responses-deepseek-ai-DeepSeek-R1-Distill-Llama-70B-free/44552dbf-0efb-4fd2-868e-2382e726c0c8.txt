Okay, so I have this calculus problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of surface area calculations. Let's take a deep breath and go through it step by step.

The question is asking about the area of a part of a helicoid. The equation given is z = arctan(y/x). Hmm, I remember that the helicoid is a surface that looks like a spiral ramp. The first octant means x, y, z are all positive, right? So we're dealing with the portion where x is between 1 and 2 because the cylinders are x² + y² =1 and x² + y²=2. Wait, no, the cylinders are circles in the x-y plane, so the radius is 1 and 2 respectively. So the region between them is like an annulus in the x-y plane, but only in the first octant.

I think the first thing I need to do is parameterize the surface. For a helicoid, a common parameterization uses cylindrical coordinates because of the symmetry. So maybe I can let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, and z = arctan(y/x) which simplifies when using these. Wait, arctan(y/x) is the same as θ when x and y are positive because θ is the angle in the first quadrant. Oh right, because arctan(y/x) gives θ when both x and y are positive. So z = θ in this case.

So the parameterization in terms of r and θ would be:
x = r cosθ,
y = r sinθ,
z = θ.

But wait, the problem says it's between the cylinders x² + y² =1 and x² + y²=2. So r goes from 1 to 2. And since it's the first octant, θ goes from 0 to π/2, because in the first octant x and y are positive, so the angle is between 0 and 90 degrees or 0 to π/2 radians.

Now, to find the surface area, I remember the formula for the surface area of a parametric surface is the double integral over the parameters of the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives. So if we have parameters u and v, the surface area is ∫∫ |r_u × r_v| du dv.

In this case, our parameters are r and θ. So I'll need to compute the partial derivatives of the parameterization with respect to r and θ, take their cross product, find its magnitude, and then integrate over r from 1 to 2 and θ from 0 to π/2.

Let me write the parameterization more clearly:
r(r, θ) = (r cosθ, r sinθ, θ).

Now, find the partial derivatives. First, ∂r/∂r:
∂r/∂r = (cosθ, sinθ, 0).

Then, ∂r/∂θ:
∂r/∂θ = (-r sinθ, r cosθ, 1).

Next, compute the cross product of these two vectors. Let's call them A and B for simplicity.

A = (cosθ, sinθ, 0),
B = (-r sinθ, r cosθ, 1).

The cross product A × B is:

|i    j      k|
|cosθ sinθ 0|
|-r sinθ r cosθ 1|

So the determinant is:

i*(sinθ*1 - 0*r cosθ) - j*(cosθ*1 - 0*(-r sinθ)) + k*(cosθ*(r cosθ) - sinθ*(-r sinθ)).

Simplify each component:

i*(sinθ) - j*(cosθ) + k*( r cos²θ + r sin²θ )

The k component simplifies further because cos²θ + sin²θ =1, so it's r*1 = r.

So the cross product is (sinθ, -cosθ, r).

The magnitude of this vector is sqrt( (sinθ)^2 + (-cosθ)^2 + (r)^2 ).

Simplify the terms inside the square root:

sin²θ + cos²θ =1, so it's sqrt(1 + r²).

So |A × B| = sqrt(1 + r²).

Now, the surface area integral becomes the double integral over r from 1 to 2 and θ from 0 to π/2 of sqrt(1 + r²) dr dθ.

Wait, is that right? Because earlier, when I took the cross product, I thought the magnitude was sqrt(1 + r²). Let me double-check. The cross product components are (sinθ, -cosθ, r). So the magnitude squared is sin²θ + cos²θ + r². Sin² + cos² is 1, so yes, 1 + r². Square root gives sqrt(1 + r²). So yes.

So the integral is ∫ (θ=0 to π/2) ∫ (r=1 to 2) sqrt(1 + r²) dr dθ.

I can separate the integrals because the integrand is separable into functions of r and θ. Since sqrt(1 + r²) doesn't depend on θ, the integral becomes:

[∫ (θ=0 to π/2) dθ ] * [ ∫ (r=1 to 2) sqrt(1 + r²) dr ]

The integral over θ is straightforward. ∫dθ from 0 to π/2 is just (π/2 - 0) = π/2.

So the surface area is (π/2) * ∫ from 1 to 2 sqrt(1 + r²) dr.

Now, I need to compute ∫ sqrt(1 + r²) dr. Hmm, I think the integral of sqrt(a² + r²) dr is (r/2) sqrt(a² + r²) + (a²/2) ln(r + sqrt(a² + r²)) ) + C. In this case, a=1, so it's:

( r/2 * sqrt(1 + r²) ) + (1/2) ln(r + sqrt(1 + r²)) ) evaluated from 1 to 2.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, evaluate at upper limit 2:
Term1 = (2/2) * sqrt(1 +4) ) = 1 * sqrt(5) = sqrt(5)
Term2 = (1/2) ln(2 + sqrt(5))
So together: sqrt(5) + (1/2) ln(2 + sqrt(5)).

Evaluate at lower limit 1:
Term1 = (1/2)*sqrt(2)
Term2 = (1/2) ln(1 + sqrt(2))

So the definite integral is [sqrt(5) + (1/2) ln(2 + sqrt(5))] - [ (sqrt(2)/2) + (1/2) ln(1 + sqrt(2)) ) ]

Simplify this:
= sqrt(5) - sqrt(2)/2 + (1/2)[ ln(2 + sqrt(5)) - ln(1 + sqrt(2)) ]

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can compute it numerically.

Wait, let me compute each part numerically.

Compute sqrt(5): about 2.23607

sqrt(2) is about 1.4142, so sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071

Now compute ln(2 + sqrt(5)).

sqrt(5) is about 2.236, so 2 + 2.236 = 4.236. ln(4.236) ≈ 1.454.

ln(1 + sqrt(2)): sqrt(2) ≈1.414, so 2.414. ln(2.414) ≈0.881.

So (1/2)(1.454 - 0.881) = (1/2)(0.573)≈0.2865.

Putting it all together:

sqrt(5) ≈2.23607
Minus 0.7071: 2.23607 - 0.7071 ≈ 1.52897
Plus 0.2865: 1.52897 + 0.2865 ≈1.81547.

So the integral ∫ from 1 to 2 sqrt(1 + r²) dr ≈1.8155.

Wait, let me check the calculation again because I might have made an error.

Wait, let me compute each part accurately.

Compute the integral from r=1 to r=2 of sqrt(1 + r^2) dr.

Let me compute each term:

At r=2:
Term1 = (2/2) * sqrt(1 +4) = 1 * sqrt(5) ≈2.23607
Term2 = (1/2) ln(2 + sqrt(5)) ≈ (1/2)*ln(4.23607) ≈ (1/2)(1.454) ≈0.727.

At r=1:
Term1 = (1/2)*sqrt(2) ≈0.7071
Term2 = (1/2) ln(1 + sqrt(2)) ≈ (1/2)*ln(2.4142) ≈ (1/2)(0.8814)≈0.4407.

So the definite integral is:

[2.23607 + 0.727] - [0.7071 + 0.4407] 
= (2.96307) - (1.1478)
= 1.81527.

So approximately 1.8153.

Now, the surface area is (π/2) * 1.8153.

Compute π/2: approximately 1.5708.

Multiply by 1.8153: 1.5708 * 1.8153 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that:

1.5 * 1.8153 = 2.72295
0.0708 *1.8153≈0.0708 *1.8 ≈0.1274
So total approx 2.72295 + 0.1274≈2.8503.

Wait, wait, wait. Let's compute 1.5708 *1.8153 more accurately.

1.5708 * 1.8153:

Compute 1 * 1.8153 =1.8153
0.5 *1.8153=0.90765
0.07 *1.8153≈0.12707
0.0008 *1.8153≈0.001452
Add them up: 1.8153 +0.90765=2.72295 +0.12707=2.85002 +0.001452≈2.85147.

So approximately 2.8515.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.843, which is close. Let me check if my approximations are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculations.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in evaluating the integral. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: The integral of sqrt(1 + r²) dr is known to be (r/2)sqrt(1 + r²) + (1/2) sinh^{-1}(r) ) + C, since the integral can be expressed using inverse hyperbolic functions. Alternatively, it can be expressed in terms of natural logs as I did earlier.

Wait, let me reevaluate the definite integral accurately.

Compute at r=2:

Term1 = (2/2)*sqrt(5) = sqrt(5) ≈2.2360679775
Term2 = (1/2) ln(2 + sqrt(5)) ≈ (1/2)*ln(4.2360679775). Let's compute ln(4.2360679775).

Using calculator:

ln(4) = 1.386294361
ln(4.2360679775) is a bit higher. Let me compute it more accurately.

4.2360679775 is e^1.454, because e^1.4 is about 4.055, e^1.45 is about 4.263. So let me compute 4.2360679775.

Actually, exact value: 2 + sqrt(5) is approximately 4.2360679775.

ln(4.2360679775) = approximately 1.443635475.

So Term2 at r=2 is (1/2)(1.443635475)≈0.7218177375.

So total for r=2: 2.2360679775 + 0.7218177375 ≈2.957885715.

At r=1:

Term1 = (1/2)*sqrt(2) ≈0.7071067812.

Term2 = (1/2) ln(1 + sqrt(2)) = (1/2) ln(2.4142135624).

ln(2.4142135624) is approximately 0.881373587.

So Term2 is 0.4406867935.

So total for r=1: 0.7071067812 + 0.4406867935 ≈1.1477935747.

So the definite integral is 2.957885715 -1.1477935747 ≈1.8100921403.

So the integral ∫ from 1 to2 sqrt(1 + r²) dr ≈1.81009.

Then the surface area is (π/2)*1.81009 ≈ (1.570796327)*1.81009.

Let me compute this product accurately.

1.570796327 * 1.81009:

Break it down:

1 * 1.81009 =1.81009

0.5 *1.81009 =0.905045

0.07 *1.81009=0.1267063

0.000796327 *1.81009≈approx 0.001442.

Wait, but wait, 1.570796327 is exactly π/2, which is approximately 1.57079632679.

So 1.57079632679 * 1.81009.

Compute using precise multiplication:

1.57079632679 ×1.81009:

We can compute 1.57079632679 ×1.8 = ?

1.57079632679 ×1.8 = 2.8260341882.

Then 1.57079632679 ×0.01009 = approximately 0.015859.

So total is approximately 2.8260341882 + 0.015859 ≈2.841893.

So approximately 2.8419.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.843, which is very close. My calculation gives approximately 2.8419, which is about 2.842. So option C is 2.843, which must be the correct answer.

I think I did everything correctly. The parameterization, the cross product, the integral setup, the evaluating of the integral. The only thing I can think of is perhaps a miscalculation in the definite integral, but the steps seem correct. So I'll go with option C.

To compute the area of the specified part of the helicoid \( z = \arctan(y/x) \) in the first octant between the cylinders \( x^2 + y^2 = 1^2 \) and \( x^2 + y^2 = 2^2 \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Parameterization**: The helicoid can be parameterized using cylindrical coordinates:
   \[
   \mathbf{r}(r, \theta) = (r \cos\theta, r \sin\theta, \theta),
   \]
   where \( r \) ranges from 1 to 2 (between the two cylinders) and \( \theta \) ranges from 0 to \( \pi/2 \) (first octant).

2. **Partial Derivatives**: Compute the partial derivatives of \( \mathbf{r} \) with respect to \( r \) and \( \theta \):
   \[
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial r} = (\cos\theta, \sin\theta, 0), \quad \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial \theta} = (-r \sin\theta, r \cos\theta, 1).
   \]

3. **Cross Product**: The cross product of the partial derivatives is:
   \[
   \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial r} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial \theta} = (\sin\theta, -\cos\theta, r).
   \]

4. **Magnitude of Cross Product**: The magnitude of the cross product is:
   \[
   \left| \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial r} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}}{\partial \theta} \right| = \sqrt{\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta + r^2} = \sqrt{1 + r^2}.
   \]

5. **Surface Area Integral**: The surface area is given by:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \int_0^{\pi/2} \int_1^2 \sqrt{1 + r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]
   Since \( \sqrt{1 + r^2} \) does not depend on \( \theta \), the integral separates:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \left( \int_0^{\pi/2} d\theta \right) \left( \int_1^2 \sqrt{1 + r^2} \, dr \right).
   \]

6. **Integral Over \( \theta \)**: The integral over \( \theta \) is:
   \[
   \int_0^{\pi/2} d\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}.
   \]

7. **Integral Over \( r \)**: The integral over \( r \) is:
   \[
   \int_1^2 \sqrt{1 + r^2} \, dr.
   \]
   Using the known result for \( \int \sqrt{1 + r^2} \, dr \), the definite integral evaluates to:
   \[
   \int_1^2 \sqrt{1 + r^2} \, dr = \left[ \frac{r}{2} \sqrt{1 + r^2} + \frac{1}{2} \ln(r + \sqrt{1 + r^2}) \right]_1^2.
   \]
   Evaluating this at \( r = 2 \) and \( r = 1 \), we find:
   \[
   \int_1^2 \sqrt{1 + r^2} \, dr \approx 1.81009.
   \
