Question:

A defendant and his college roommate went home together for the holiday vacation. The defendant was to go back to college by himself. The day that the defendant was to drive back to college, his roommate asked him if he would deliver a package to one of their classmates. The defendant agreed, and the roommate gave him a small package, which the defendant placed in his glove compartment. While driving back to school, the defendant was stopped for speeding. When the state trooper asked the defendant for his license and registration, he reached into the glove compartment. As he did, the package that his roommate had given him fell onto the floor. When it hit the floor, the box broke open and a plastic envelope containing a white substance slid out. Seeing that the substance appeared to be cocaine, the state trooper arrested the defendant for possession of illegal narcotics under a state statute making it a felony to willfully possess a controlled substance. The package did, in fact, contain cocaine. If the defendant is later brought to trial for this charge, his best defense is that

Options:

A: the package didn't belong to him.
B: the cocaine was illegally seized.
C: the trooper didn't have a search warrant.
D: the defendant didn't know what was in the package.
E: the roommate didn't tell him he was carrying illegal narcotics.
F: the roommate should be the one charged, not him.
G: the substance was not tested to confirm it was cocaine.
H: the defendant didn't willingly possess the substance.
I: the cocaine was not in a recognizable form.
J: the defendant was not speeding.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically dealing with possession of illegal narcotics. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the scenario: The defendant and his roommate go home for the holidays. The defendant is supposed to drive back to college alone. On the day he's leaving, the roommate asks him to deliver a package to a classmate. He agrees and puts the small package in his glove compartment. Later, he's stopped for speeding. When he reaches for his license and registration, the package falls out, breaks open, revealing a plastic envelope with a white substance, which looks like cocaine. He's arrested for possession.

The question is about his best defense. The options are A through J.

I remember that possession can be actual or constructive. Actual possession is when the person has direct physical control, like holding it. Constructive possession is when the person has control over the place where the substance is found, even if not directly on their person. But for constructive possession, the prosecution usually needs to show that the person knew the substance was there and that it was illegal.

So, in this case, the defendant had the package in his glove compartment. He didn't own the package; it was his roommate's. But he agreed to deliver it. The key here is whether he knew what was inside. If he didn't know, he might not have the requisite mens rea (guilty mind) for possession. The statute makes it a felony to willfully possess a controlled substance. "Willfully" usually implies intentional or purposeful conduct.

Looking at the options:

A: The package didn't belong to him. That might relate to ownership, but possession isn't necessarily about ownership. If he knowingly had control, ownership doesn't matter. So this might not be the strongest defense.

B: The cocaine was illegally seized. But the trooper was stopping him for speeding, which is a valid reason. When the defendant opened the glove compartment, the package fell out. This seems like it was in plain view, so the seizure might be legal under the plain view doctrine. So B might not work.

C: The trooper didn't have a search warrant. Again, if it's plain view during a lawful stop, no warrant is needed. So C is probably not a good defense.

D: The defendant didn't know what was in the package. This goes to the mens rea. If he can prove he didn't know, he lacked the willfulness required for the crime. So D seems promising.

E: The roommate didn't tell him. This is similar to D. If the roommate didn't say it was illegal, but the defendant still should have known, maybe. But D is more directâ€”asserting lack of knowledge.

F: The roommate should be charged. That's not a defense for the defendant. The law focuses on the individual's actions, not others. So F isn't helpful.

G: The substance wasn't tested. But the question states it did contain cocaine, so this is irrelevant. G isn't a good option.

H: The defendant didn't willingly possess. This is another way of saying he lacked intent. It's similar to D. So H is also a contender.

I: The substance wasn't recognizable. The question says it appeared to be cocaine, and it was. So I doesn't apply.

J: He wasn't speeding. But the question says he was stopped for speeding, and that's a valid reason. Even if he wasn't, the stop might still be valid if the trooper had reasonable suspicion. Plus, J is about the stop itself, which is a different issue than possession.

So the main options are D and H. What's the difference? D says he didn't know what was in the package. H says he didn't willingly possess, which is more about the mens rea.

Wait, the statute requires willfully possessing. So "willfully" would mean intentionally or knowingly. If he didn't know the package contained cocaine, he didn't possess it willfully. So both D and H are pointing to the same thing.

Looking back, the options: H says the defendant didn't willingly possess the substance. That's a direct denial of the required mens rea. D is about the defendant's knowledge of the contents, which supports H.

So which is the best defense? The question is about the best defense. The defendant's lack of knowledge would negate the willfulness. So the best defense is that he didn't know, which is D. Alternatively, H is stating the legal conclusion.

Wait, but in the options, H is phrased as "the defendant didn't willingly possess the substance." So that's a legal argument based on the required element. D is a factual argument that he didn't know.

In court, the defendant would argue that he lacked knowledge, which negates the willfulness. So the best defense is D: the defendant didn't know what was in the package.

Alternatively, H is a defense based on the legal element, but the question asks for his best defense, which would be presenting the lack of knowledge.

I think the correct answer is D. Because if he didn't know, he couldn't have willfully possessed. So D is the best defense.

The defendant's best defense is that he lacked knowledge of the package's contents, which negates the required mens rea for willful possession. 

Answer: D
