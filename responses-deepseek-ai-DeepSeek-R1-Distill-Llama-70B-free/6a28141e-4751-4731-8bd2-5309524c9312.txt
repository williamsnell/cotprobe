Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the rotation of the plane of polarization in a quartz plate. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with optical activity in crystals. Let me think.

The question gives me the indices of refraction for right (n_R) and left (n_L) circularly polarized light. The wavelength is violet light at 396.0 nm, and the plate is 1 mm thick. Oh wait, right, the formula for rotation is something like theta equals (pi * (n_R - n_L) * d) / lambda, but wait, wait... Or is it degree per some unit? No, wait, I think the formula is θ = (n_R - n_L) * d * (180/pi) * (something with the wavelength). Or am I mixing things up?

Wait, I'm a bit rusty here. Let me get this straight. The rotation angle θ is given by the difference in the refractive indices multiplied by the thickness of the plate, divided by the wavelength, and then converted into degrees. Oh right, because the formula is θ (in radians) equals (n_R - n_L) * (2πd)/λ. Wait, no, that's for phase shift. Or maybe I should think about the specific rotation.

Wait, maybe I should recall that for quartz, the specific rotation [α] is given by (n_R - n_L) * 1e-2 mm^{-1} or something. Or perhaps the rotation in degrees is calculated as θ = (n_R - n_L) * (d / λ) * (180/pi) * something?

Wait, let me think in terms of path difference. The difference in refractive indices leads to a phase difference. For each wavelength, a phase difference of 2π radians corresponds to a rotation of the plane by a certain amount. Oh right, because each wavelength corresponds to 360 degrees of phase, so the phase difference Δφ = (2π/λ) * (n_R - n_L) * d. Then, the rotation angle θ is half of that phase difference because the rotation is in degrees. Hmm, I'm not entirely confident about that last part.

Wait, another approach. The formula for the rotation angle θ in degrees is given by θ = (n_R - n_L) * (d / λ) * (180/π). Does that make sense? Let me check the units. n_R and n_L are unitless, d is in meters, λ in meters. So (d/λ) is unitless. Then multiplied by 180/π (unitless) gives degrees. Oh, that seems plausible.

Wait, or is it θ = (n_R - n_L) * (d / λ) * (180/π) * (something)? Or maybe it's θ = [(n_R - n_L) * d * 1e6 nm/m ] * (180/π) * (1 radian to degree factor)?

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the formula correctly. The rotation θ in radians is (n_R - n_L) * (2π d) / λ. Because the phase change per meter is 2π times the difference in refractive indices, multiplied by the thickness. Then, since θ is in radians, to convert to degrees, multiply by (180/pi). So putting it all together:

θ (degrees) = (n_R - n_L) * (2π d) / λ * (180/pi) 

Simplify that. The 2 and pi cancel out, leaving (n_R - n_L) * (180 * d) / λ.

Wait, let's do the math. 2π radians is 360 degrees. So when you have phase difference Δφ = (n_R - n_L) * 2π d / λ, the rotation is θ = Δφ / (2π) * 360 degrees, because each 2π phase shift corresponds to a full 360-degree rotation? Or is it that the phase difference for each circular component leads to a rotation. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, maybe I should look for the formula. Oh right, the formula for the rotation angle is θ = (n_R - n_L) * d * (180 / pi) * (1/λ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach: the optical activity (specific rotation) is given as [α] = (n_R - n_L) * (1e2 mm/λ nm) * (something). Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for the standard formula. From what I remember, the rotation angle θ (in degrees) is given by:

θ = (n_R - n_L) * (d / λ) * (180 / π) * (something)

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is θ = (n_R - n_L) * (d [mm]) * (1e-3 m/mm) / (λ [nm]) * (1e9 nm/m) ) * ( (180 degrees) / (pi) ) * (....) Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to structure this step by step.

1. Compute the difference in refractive indices: Δn = n_R - n_L.

Given n_R = 1.55610 and n_L = 1.55821. Wait no, wait, wait, n_R is right circularly polarized, and n_L is left. In quartz, which is a positive crystal, n_R > n_L? Or is it the other way around? Wait, I think in quartz, n_o is for ordinary rays, and n_e for extraordinary. Wait, but for circular polarization, right and left have different refractive indices. Wait, maybe I should just compute Δn = n_R - n_L.

Wait, n_R is 1.55610, n_L is 1.55821. So Δn = 1.55610 - 1.55821 = -0.00211. Oh, so Δn is negative. Hmm, that will affect the direction of rotation, but the problem just asks for the magnitude, I think.

But wait, in the formula, maybe it's the absolute value. Let's proceed with the magnitude for now.

So Δn = 0.00211 (taking absolute value).

Wait, wait, no, if n_R is 1.55610 and n_L is 1.55821, then n_R < n_L, so Δn is negative. So the rotation is in the opposite direction, but for the calculation, we can proceed with the magnitude.

2. The thickness d is 1 mm. Convert that into meters: 1e-3 m.

3. The wavelength λ is 396.0 nm, which is 396e-9 meters.

4. Now, plug into the formula. The general formula for optical rotation is θ (in radians) = (Δn) * (2π d) / λ. Then, to convert to degrees, multiply by (180/π).

So θ_rad = Δn * 2π d / λ

θ_deg = θ_rad * (180/π)

So putting it together:

θ_deg = (Δn * 2π d / λ) * (180/π) )

Simplify:

θ_deg = (Δn * 2 * 180 * d ) / λ

Wait, because π cancels, 2π * (180/π) = 360. Wait, let me do the math step by step.

θ_deg = (Δn * (2π d) / λ) * (180/π) )

The π cancels, so 2 * 180 = 360.

So θ_deg = (Δn * 2 * 180 * d ) / λ.

Wait, wait, no:

Wait, 2π d * (180/π) ) = 2 * 180 d = 360 d. Wait, that can't be right. Let me re-express:

(2π d / λ) * (180/π) ) = (2 * 180 d) / λ.

So θ_deg = (Δn) * (2 * 180 d) / λ.

Wait, that can't be right because units would be (unitless) * (meters) / meters ) → unitless, which is correct, but let me make sure.

Δn is unitless, d is in meters, λ in meters. So (d/λ) is unitless, so θ_deg is unitless, which it is.

So θ_deg = (Δn) * (2 * 180 * d ) / λ.

But let's plug in the numbers.

Δn = 0.00211 (taken as absolute value, but actually it's negative, but the problem asks for rotation which direction may not matter here).

d = 1 mm = 1e-3 m.

λ = 396 nm = 396e-9 m.

So substituting:

θ_deg = 0.00211 * 2 * 180 * (1e-3) / (396e-9)

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

First, compute the numerator: 0.00211 * 2 * 180 * 1e-3

0.00211 * 2 = 0.00422

0.00422 * 180 = 0.7596

0.7596 * 1e-3 = 0.0007596

Denominator: 396e-9 = 3.96e-7 meters.

So theta_deg = 0.0007596 / 3.96e-7 = ?

Let me compute 0.0007596 / 3.96e-7.

Hmm, 0.0007596 is 7.596e-4.

Divide by 3.96e-7:

7.596e-4 / 3.96e-7 = (7.596 / 3.96) * 1e3.

7.596 / 3.96 ≈ 1.917.

So 1.917 * 1e3 = 1917 degrees.

Wait, that's way too high. Because 1917 degrees is like 5 full rotations (5*360=1800), so 1917-1800=117 degrees. So you'd get a rotation of 117 degrees, but wait, that's not any of the options. The options are 30,45,60,75,90,100,120,135,150, etc. Hmm.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, Δn is actually n_R - n_L = 1.55610 - 1.55821 = -0.00211. So the actual Δn is negative, which means the rotation is in the opposite direction, but the magnitude is 0.00211. So the calculation is correct.

Wait, let me compute 0.0007596 divided by 3.96e-7.

Wait, 3.96e-7 is 0.000000396.

So 0.0007596 / 0.000000396 = ?

Let me compute that.

0.0007596 / 0.000000396 ≈ 

Well, 0.0007596 is 759.6e-6, and 0.000000396 is 396e-9.

So 759.6e-6 / 396e-9 = (759.6 / 396) * (1e-6 / 1e-9) )= (approx 1.917) * 1e3 = 1917.

So 1917 degrees. But that's way larger than any of the options given, which go up to 150. So I must have made a mistake in the formula somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again. Maybe the formula is θ = (n_R - n_L) * (d (mm)) * (1/(λ (nm))) ) * (some factor).

Wait, another approach: The specific rotation [α] is given by (n_R - n_L) * 1e2 mm/λ nm. Or perhaps [α] is (n_R - n_L) * (1e6 nm/m) * d (m) / λ (nm) ) * (180/pi). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of specific rotation.

Wait, I think the specific rotation is given as [α] = (n_R - n_L) * 1e2 (mm) / (λ nm) ) * (180/pi), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another source I once studied said the rotation θ in degrees is given by θ = (n_R - n_L) * (d (in mm)) * (1e3 mm/m) ) * (1e9 nm/m) / λ (nm) ) * (180/pi) * (something). Wait, perhaps it's better to consider unit conversions more carefully.

Let me restate the variables:

Δn = n_R - n_L = 1.55610 - 1.55821 = -0.00211.

But we'll take the magnitude for now, so 0.00211.

d = 1 mm = 0.001 m.

λ = 396 nm = 396e-9 m.

So the formula I thought was θ = (Δn) * (2π d) / λ * (180/π).

Wait, let's compute that again:

θ_rad = (Δn) * (2π d) / λ

Then, θ_deg = θ_rad * (180/π)

So θ_deg = (Δn) * 2π d / λ * (180/π) = (Δn) * 2 d * 180 / λ.

So θ_deg = (Δn) * (360 d) / λ.

Wait, let's compute that.

Δn = 0.00211.

d=0.001 m.

λ=396e-9 m.

So 360 * d / λ = 360 * 0.001 / 396e-9.

Wait, 0.001 is 1e-3, 396e-9 is 3.96e-7.

So 360 * 1e-3 / 3.96e-7 = 360 * (1e-3 / 3.96e-7) = 360 * (1e4 / 3.96).

Wait, 1e-3 / 3.96e-7 = (1e-3) / (3.96e-7) = (1 / 3.96) * 1e4.

Because 1e-3 is 1e-3, and 3.96e-7 is 3.96 * 1e-7. So (1e-3)/(3.96e-7) = (1)/(3.96) * (1e-3 / 1e-7) ) = (1/3.96) * 1e4.

So 1e4 /3.96 ≈ 2525.25.

So 360 * 2525.25 ≈ 907,  360 * 2500 is 900,000, but wait, 360 * 2525 = 360 *2500=900,000 and 360*25=9,000 → total 909,000. But that's way too big.

Wait, but wait, θ_deg is (Δn) * 360 * d / λ.

So θ_deg = 0.00211 * 360 * (1e-3) / (396e-9)

Wait, let's compute each part.

Compute denominator: 396e-9 = 3.96e-7.

Compute 1e-3 / 3.96e-7 = (1e-3) / (3.96e-7) = (1 / 3.96) * 1e4 ≈ 0.2525 * 1e4 = 2525.

Then, 0.00211 * 360 = 0.7596.

So 0.7596 * 2525 ≈ 1917 degrees.

Wait, same result as before. But the options don't go beyond 150. So I'm definitely doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the formula is θ = (n_R - n_L) * (d / λ) * (180/pi). Let me try that.

θ_deg = (0.00211) * (1e-3 m / 396e-9 m) * (180/pi)

Compute (1e-3)/(396e-9) = 1e-3 / 3.96e-7 = approx 2525.25.

Multiply by 0.00211: 0.00211 * 2525.25 ≈ 5.327.

Multiply by (180/pi) ≈ 57.2958.

5.327 * 57.2958 ≈ 305 degrees.

Again, that's over 300 degrees, which isn't among the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is θ = (n_R - n_L) * (d (mm)) * (1e3 mm/m) ) * (1e9 nm/m) / λ (nm) ) * (180/pi).

Wait, let me try that.

Wait, d is 1 mm, which is 1e-3 m or 1e3 mm/m? No, wait, 1 mm = 1e-3 m. So 1 mm = 1e3 mm/m? No, wait, no. Wait, 1 m = 1e3 mm. So 1 mm = 1e-3 m. So d = 1 mm = 1e-3 m.

Wait, perhaps I should instead convert d to mm, but that's how it's given.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the phase difference first.

The phase difference Δφ (in radians) is (2π/λ) * (n_R - n_L) * d.

But wait, n_R and n_L are unitless, d is in meters, λ in meters. So (2π/λ) is in radians per meter.

So Δφ = (2π / λ) * (n_R - n_L) * d.

But wait, if n_R and n_L are the refractive indices for right and left circularly polarized light, then the difference in their velocities would cause a phase difference.

So calculate Δφ = (2π d (n_R - n_L)) / λ.

Then, the rotation angle θ is half of that phase difference because each full rotation (2π) corresponds to one full wavelength shift.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, for linearly polarized light, entering a crystal that splits into right and left circular, each with different speeds. The phase difference between them upon exiting is Δφ = (2π/λ) (n_R - n_L) d.

The rotation of the plane of polarization is then θ = Δφ / 2. Because the phase difference between the two circular components causes the
