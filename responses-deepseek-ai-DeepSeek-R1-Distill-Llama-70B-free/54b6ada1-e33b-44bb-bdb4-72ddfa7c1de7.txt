Okay, so I've got this problem about a journal bearing, and I need to find the friction coefficient and the heat energy lost using Petroff's equation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me the following data:

- Bearing length, L = 3 inches
- Shaft diameter, D = 4 inches
- Radial clearance, c = 0.0025 inches
- Radial load, W = 1000 lbs
- Speed, N = 500 rpm
- Operating temperature = 140°F
- Lubricant is SAE 20 oil.

I remember that Petroff's equation is used for journal bearings to calculate the coefficient of friction. The equation is:

f = (π * η * N * D) / (60 * W) * (c / r)

Wait, wait. Or is it f = (π * η * N * D * L) / (60 * W) * (c / D)? Because I think the general form might involve some other factors. Or maybe it's f = (r * ω * η) / (p * c), but I might be mixing things up here.

Wait, no, I think the correct Petroff's formula is f = (2 * π * μ * N * D * L) / (60 * W) * (c / D). Or perhaps the formula I should use is f = (π * μ * N * D * L) / (60 * W) * (c / D). Alternatively, I might be mixing it with another formula, like power loss.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Petroff's equation is for the coefficient of friction in a journal bearing, and it's given by f = (2 * π * μ * N * D * L) / (W * (1 - (r_bearing^2 - r_shaft^2)/r_shaft^2)))... Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the power loss first and then find the coefficient of friction.

Wait, I think the key here is that the Petroff's equation for power loss is H = (2 * π^2 * μ * N^2 * D^3 * L) / (60 * c), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the friction torque is given by T = f * W * r, where r is the radius of the shaft.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to get this straight. The coefficient of friction in a journal bearing can be found using the formula f = (π * μ * D * N) / (60 * W) * (c / D). Wait, that doesn't seem right dimensionally. Let me think.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the friction coefficient (f) using Petroff's theory is:

f = (2 * π * μ * D * N) / (60 * W) * (c / D) * (L / D)

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, I've read that the coefficient of friction for a journal bearing is given by f = (π * η * D * N) / (60 * W) * (c / D). So, the formula would be f = (π * η * N * c) / (60 * W) ) * (D/L), maybe? Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, let me check the formula again. Petroff's equation for friction in a journal bearing is:

f = (2 * π * μ * D * N * L) / (60 * W) ) * (c / D)

Wait, that would make f = (2 * π * μ * N * L * c) / (60 * W) )

Hmm, perhaps that's the correct approach. So, the variables are:

- μ is the absolute viscosity of the oil
- D is the shaft diameter
- N is the speed in rpm
- L is the length of the bearing
- W is the radial load
- c is the radial clearance

But wait, I need to find μ, the viscosity, at the operating temperature of 140°F. The oil used is SAE 20. I remember that the viscosity of SAE 20 oil at 140°F is about 150 SUS (Saybolt Universal Seconds). Wait, or is it a different value?

Wait, I think the viscosity of SAE 20 oil at 100°F is around 150 SUS, but when the temperature increases, the viscosity decreases. Wait, but 140°F is higher than 100°F, so the viscosity would be lower than 150 SUS. Alternatively, maybe I should look up the viscosity in terms of centipoise (cP) or other units.

Wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think: the viscosity in SUS needs to be converted to centistokes (cSt) because 1 SUS ≈ 0.219 cSt. Alternatively, the formula might require the viscosity in poise, which is 1 P = 100 cP = 1 dyne·s/cm².

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the viscosity in reyns. Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the units here. Let me try to structure this properly.

First, I need to find the viscosity of SAE 20 oil at 140°F. I think that at higher temperatures, the viscosity decreases. So, if at 100°F, SAE 20 has a viscosity of around 150 SUS, then at 140°F, it would be lower. Let me say for the sake of calculation that it's 100 SUS.

Wait, no, perhaps I should recall that SAE 20 oil at 100°F has a viscosity of about 150 SUS, and at 210°F, it's around 40 SUS. So, the viscosity decreases as temperature increases. So, at 140°F, which is between 100°F and 210°F, the viscosity is somewhere in between. Maybe around 100 SUS? Alternatively, perhaps a more precise value would be better, but without exact data, I'll proceed with an assumption.

So, let's say the viscosity is μ = 100 SUS. Now, I need to convert this to centipoise (cP) because Petroff's formula uses μ in cP.

Wait, 1 SUS is approximately 0.219 cSt, and 1 cSt is equal to 1 mm²/s, and 1 cP is 1 mPa·s, which is the same as 1 cP. So, 1 SUS ≈ 0.219 cP.

So, if μ is 100 SUS, then in cP, it would be μ = 100 * 0.219 = 21.9 cP.

Wait, but wait, 1 SUS is approximately 0.219 cSt, which is equivalent to 0.219 cP. So yes, 100 SUS would be 21.9 cP.

Now, the formula for the friction coefficient is f = (2 * π * μ * D * N * L * c) / (60 * W * D).

Wait, let me write that correctly. Let me make sure of the formula. From what I recall, the Petroff's equation for friction in a journal bearing is:

f = (2 * π * μ * D * N * L * c) / (60 * W * D), but wait, that can't be right because the D's would cancel. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

f = (2 * π * μ * N * L * c) / (60 * W * D)

Because I think the D in the numerator and denominator would cancel, so that's probably correct.

Wait, let me make sure. The formula for the coefficient of friction (f) is:

f = (2 * π * μ * N * L * c) / (60 * W * D)

So, plugging in the numbers:

μ = 21.9 cP (from 100 SUS)
N = 500 rpm
L = 3 inches
c = 0.0025 inches
W = 1000 lbs
D = 4 inches

But wait, I think I might have messed up the units. Let me check the units for each variable.

- μ: cP = centipoise = 0.001 Pa·s = 0.01 Poise.
- D: inches
- N: rpm
- L: inches
- c: inches
- W: pounds.

But in the formula, all units must be consistent. So perhaps I need to convert D, L, c to meters or another unit, and W to Newtons, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe there's an alternative form of the formula that uses inches, pounds, etc.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula in a way that's consistent with the units.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another way. I think the formula can also be written as:

f = (2 * π * μ * D * N * L * c) / (60 * W * D)

Wait, but that would make D cancel out, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

f = (2 * π * μ * N * L * c) / (60 * W * D)

Yes, that makes more sense.

So, substituting the values:

μ = 21.9 cP = 0.0219 Poise (since 1 Poise = 100 cP)
N = 500 rpm
L = 3 inches
c = 0.0025 inches
W = 1000 lbs
D = 4 inches

Wait, but Poise is in P = dyn·s/cm², and cP is 0.01 Poise.

Now, let me compute each term.

First, 2 * π ≈ 6.2832.

So, numerator: 6.2832 * μ * N * L * c.

Denominator: 60 * W * D.

So, plugging in the values:

Numerator = 6.2832 * 0.0219 Poise * 500 rpm * 3 in * 0.0025 in.

Denominator = 60 min * 1000 lbs * 4 in.

Wait, but I'm mixing units here. Poise is dyn·s/cm². So I need to make sure all units are consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to convert all units to a consistent system, like SI units.

So, let me convert each variable to SI units.

First, μ = 21.9 cP = 0.0219 Poise. Since 1 Poise = 0.1 N·s/m², so μ = 0.0219 * 0.1 = 0.00219 N·s/m².

D = 4 inches = 0.1016 meters (since 1 inch ≈ 0.0254 m)
L = 3 inches = 0.0762 m
c = 0.0025 inches = 0.0000635 m
N = 500 rpm = 500/60 rotations per second ≈ 8.3333 Hz
W = 1000 lbs = 1000 * 4.44822 N ≈ 4448.22 N

Now, plug these into the formula:

f = (2 * π * μ * N * L * c) / (60 * W * D)

Wait, no, because N is in rpm, and I converted it to Hz (per second). So 500 rpm is 500/60 ≈ 8.3333 Hz.

So let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator = 2 * π * μ * N * L * c
= 2 * 3.1416 * 0.00219 N·s/m² * 8.3333 1/s * 0.0762 m * 0.0000635 m

Denominator = 60 * W * D
= 60 * 4448.22 N * 0.1016 m

Let me compute numerator first.

Compute each term step by step.

2 * π ≈ 6.2832

μ = 0.00219 N·s/m²

N = 8.3333 Hz

L = 0.0762 m

c = 0.0000635 m

So numerator:

6.2832 * 0.00219 = let's compute 6 * 0.00219 = 0.01314, 0.2832 * 0.00219 ≈ 0.000620. So total ≈ 0.01314 + 0.00062 ≈ 0.01376.

Then multiply by N: 0.01376 * 8.3333 ≈ 0.1146.

Multiply by L: 0.1146 * 0.0762 ≈ 0.00873.

Multiply by c: 0.00873 * 0.0000635 ≈ 5.55e-8.

So numerator ≈ 5.55e-8 N·s·m²/m²? Wait, let me check the units.

Wait, μ is N·s/m², N is per second, L is m, c is m. So overall, the numerator units should be:

( N·s/m² ) * (1/s) * m * m = N·s/m² * 1/s * m² = N·s/m² * m²/s = N.

Denominator is 60 * W * D, which is (unitless) * N * m = N·m.

So f = numerator / denominator = (N) / (N·m) ) = 1/m, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, I must have messed up the formula. Let me try to find the correct Petroff's equation.

After some research, I remember that the Petroff's formula for the coefficient of friction is:

f = (2 * π * μ * D * N) / (60 * W) ) * (c / D)

Wait, that would simplify to f = (2 * π * μ * N * c) / (60 * W)

Because D cancels out. That makes sense.

So, let me try this formula.

f = (2 * π * μ * N * c) / (60 * W)

But in this case, the units should work out correctly.

Now, substituting the values:

μ = 0.00219 N·s/m² (from 21.9 cP)
N = 500 rpm = 500/60 ≈ 8.3333 Hz
c = 0.0000635 m
W = 4448.22 N

So,

f = (2 * π * 0.00219 * 8.3333 * 0.0000635) / (60 * 4448.22)

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator:

2 * π ≈ 6.2832

6.2832 * 0.00219 ≈ 0.01376

0.01376 * 8.3333 ≈ 0.1146

0.1146 * 0.0000635 ≈ 0.00000728

Denominator:

60 * 4448.22 ≈ 266,893.2

So f ≈ 0.00000728 / 266893.2 ≈ 2.727e-11

Wait, that can't be right. The friction coefficient can't be that small. I must have made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I should not have converted μ to N·s/m². Maybe I should keep it in Poise and use a different approach with unit conversions.

Let me try another approach, using the formula in a way that keeps the units consistent without converting to SI.

The formula is:

f = (2 * π * μ * D * N * c) / (60 * W * D)

Wait, but D cancels out, so f = (2 * π * μ * N * c) / (60 * W)

But now, using μ in Poise, D in inches, N in rpm, c in inches, and W in pounds.

I think there's a version of the formula where μ is in centipoise, D and c in inches, N in rpm, and W in pounds, and the units all work out.

So let me try that.

Given:

μ = 21.9 cP
D = 4 inches
N = 500 rpm
c = 0.0025 inches
W = 1000 lbs

So the formula is:

f = (2 * π * μ * N * c) / (60 * W)

Plugging in the values:

f = (2 * π * 21.9 * 500 * 0.0025) / (60 * 1000)

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator:

2 * π ≈ 6.2832

6.2832 * 21.9 ≈ 137.55

137.55 * 500 = 68,775

68,775 * 0.0025 = 171.9375

Denominator:

60 * 1000 = 60,000

So f = 171.9375 / 60,000 ≈ 0.002866.

So f ≈ 0.002866.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of the options have 0.002866. The closest would be option A: 0.003284, option E: 0.002754.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the viscosity value. Earlier, I assumed μ was 100 SUS, leading to 21.9 cP. But maybe the correct value is different.

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact viscosity of SAE 20 oil at 140°F. Let me think: SAE 20 has a viscosity of about 150 SUS at 100°F, and perhaps around 100 SUS at 140°F. But maybe it's lower. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a more precise value.

Wait, I think the correct conversion is that SAE 20 at 100°F is 150 SUS, and at higher temperatures, the viscosity decreases. At 140°F, it might be around 90 SUS. So let's try with 90 SUS.

So μ = 90 SUS * 0.219 cP/SUS ≈ 19.71 cP.

Now, let's recalculate f:

f = (2 * π * 19.71 * 500 * 0.0025) / (60 * 1000)

Compute numerator:

2 * π ≈ 6.2832

6.2832 * 19.71 ≈ 123.86

123.86 * 500 = 61,930

61,930 * 0.0025 = 154.825

Denominator: 60,000

f = 154.825 / 60,000 ≈ 0.0025804.

Hmm, that's about 0.00258, which is close to option E's 0.002754. But maybe my assumption on the viscosity
