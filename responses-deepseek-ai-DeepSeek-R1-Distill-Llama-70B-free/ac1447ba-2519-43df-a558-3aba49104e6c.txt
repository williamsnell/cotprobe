Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the National Air Races in Reno, Nevada. The planes are flying around pylons, and during a turn, the maximum centripetal acceleration a pilot can withstand is about 6g. The plane's speed is 150 m/s, and we need to find the turning radius for an acceleration of 6g.

Hmm, centripetal acceleration. I remember that centripetal acceleration is the acceleration experienced by an object moving in a circular path. The formula for centripetal acceleration is a = v² / r, where a is the acceleration, v is the velocity, and r is the radius of the turn. So we're given a and v, and we need to find r.

Wait, but wait. The acceleration given is 6g. Oh right, g is the acceleration due to gravity, which is about 9.8 m/s². So 6g would be 6 times that. So first, I should calculate what 6g is in terms of m/s².

Let me calculate that. 6 times 9.8 is... 6 * 9 is 54, and 6 * 0.8 is 4.8, so total is 58.8 m/s². So a = 58.8 m/s².

The velocity v is given as 150 m/s. So plugging into the formula a = v² / r, I can rearrange it to solve for r. So r = v² / a.

Let me write that down. So r equals (150 m/s) squared divided by 58.8 m/s².

Calculating 150 squared: 150 * 150. Hmm, 15 * 15 is 225, so 150 squared is 22500. So 22500 divided by 58.8.

Wait, what's 22500 divided by 58.8? Let me do this division. Maybe I can approximate.

Alternatively, 58.8 is close to 60. 22500 / 60 is 375. But since 58.8 is slightly less than 60, the result will be slightly higher than 375. Hmm, let me compute it more accurately.

So 22500 / 58.8. Let me write this as 22500 ÷ 58.8.

I can simplify this by multiplying numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal: 225000 ÷ 588.

Now, let me see how many times 588 goes into 225000.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step.

Let me try 588 * 380 = ?

Well, 588 * 300 is 176400.

588 * 80 is 47040. So 176400 + 47040 = 223440.

Hmm, 223440 is less than 225000. The difference is 225000 - 223440 = 1560.

So now, how many times does 588 go into 1560?

588 * 2 is 1176.

1560 - 1176 = 384.

588 goes into 384 zero times, but maybe 0.6 times? Let me check 588 * 0.6 = 352.8. Hmm, that's less than 384. So 0.6, and the remainder is 384 - 352.8 = 31.2.

So putting it all together, 380 + 2 = 382, plus 0.6 is 382.6, but with a remainder of 31.2. So approximately 382.6 with some extra.

Wait, but maybe I'm making this more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can just compute 22500 /58.8 using a calculator approach.

Wait, 58.8 times 382. Let me compute 58.8 * 382.

Wait, 382 is 300 + 80 + 2.

58.8 * 300 = 17,640.

58.8 * 80 = 4,704.

58.8 * 2 = 117.6.

Adding these together: 17,640 + 4,704 = 22,344. Then +117.6 gives 22,461.6.

Wait, but 22,461.6 is less than 22,500. The difference is 38.4.

So 382 gives 22,461.6, which is 38.4 less than 22,500. So how much more do we need?

Let's find 38.4 /58.8. That's 0.653... So approximately 0.653 more.

So total is 382 + 0.653 ≈ 382.653, so approximately 382.65 meters.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, the options are in the hundreds. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A: 1.5 ×10² m → 150 m

B: 4.2 ×10² → 420 m

C: 6.8 ×10² → 680 m

D:3.83 ×10² → 383 m

E:2.5 ×10² → 250 m

F:4.5 ×10² → 450 m

G:5.0 →500 m

H:7.5 →750 m

I:2.0 →200 m

J:3.0 →300 m

So my calculation is approximately 382.65 meters. Looking at the options, option D is 3.83e2 m, which is 383 m. That's very close to my calculation. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The centripetal acceleration formula is a = v²/r → r = v²/a.

v is 150 m/s, so v squared is 150^2 = 22500.

a is 6g = 6 *9.8 =58.8 m/s².

r = 22500 /58.8 = ?

Using a calculator to compute 22500 ÷58.8.

Let me do this more accurately.

58.8 × 382 = ?

As before, 382 ×58.8 = 382 × (50 +8 +0.8) = 382×50=19,100; 382×8=3,056; 382×0.8=305.6.

Adding those: 19,100 + 3,056 =22,156; +305.6 →22,461.6.

But 22500 is less than 22,461.6? No, wait, 22500 is 22,500, which is higher than 22,461.6.

So 382 gives 22,461.6. The difference is 22,500 -22,461.6 =38.4.

So 38.4 /58.8 = 0.653.

So total r is 382.653 m, approximately 382.65 m. So the closest option is D: 3.83 ×10² m, which is 383 m.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is D.

To determine the turning radius for a plane traveling at 150 m/s with a centripetal acceleration of 6g, we use the formula for centripetal acceleration:

\[
a = \frac{v^2}{r} \quad \text{or rearranged as} \quad r = \frac{v^2}{a}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the centripetal acceleration in m/s²
The acceleration is given as \( 6g \), where \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). Thus:

\[
a = 6 \times 9.8 = 58.8 \, \text{m/s}^2.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the turning radius
The velocity of the plane is \( v = 150 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting into the formula \( r = \frac{v^2}{a} \):

\[
r = \frac{150^2}{58.8} = \frac{22500}{58.8}.
\]

Performing the division:

\[
r \approx 382.65 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated radius \( r \approx 382.65 \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **D: \( 3.83 \times 10^2 \, \text{m} \)**, which is \( 383 \, \text{m} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D**
