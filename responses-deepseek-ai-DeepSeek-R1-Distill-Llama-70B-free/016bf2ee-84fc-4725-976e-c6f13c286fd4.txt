Question:

TheRydberg- Ritz equation governing the spectral lines of hydrogen is (1/\lambda) = R [(1/n_1 ^2) - (1/n_2 ^2)], where R is the Rydberg constant, n_1 indexes the series under consideration (n_1 = 1 for the Lyman series, n_1 = 2 for theBalmerseries, n_1 = 3 for thePaschenseries), n_2 = n_1 + 1, n_1 + 2, n_1 + 3, . . . indexes the successive lines in a series, and \lambda is the wave- length of the line corresponding to index n_2. Thus, for the Lyman series, n_1 = 1 and the first two lines are 1215.56 \AA (n_2 = n_1 + 1 = 2) and 1025.83 \AA (n_2 = n_1 + 2 = 3). Using these two lines, calculate two separate values of the Rydberg constant. The actual value of this constant is R = 109678 cm^-1.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Rydberg-Ritz equation and calculating the Rydberg constant. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The equation given is 1/λ = R[(1/n₁²) - (1/n₂²)]. I remember that R is the Rydberg constant, and for hydrogen, it's around 109678 cm⁻¹. The problem gives two wavelengths from the Lyman series, which is when n₁=1. The first line has λ=1215.56 Å with n₂=2, and the second is 1025.83 Å with n₂=3.

So, I need to calculate R for each of these lines. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I should convert the wavelengths from Angstroms to centimeters because R is in cm⁻¹. I remember that 1 Å is 1e-8 cm, right? So 1215.56 Å is 1215.56e-8 cm, and 1025.83 Å is 1025.83e-8 cm.

Wait, let me write that down:
λ1 = 1215.56 Å = 1215.56e-8 cm
λ2 = 1025.83 Å = 1025.83e-8 cm

Now, using the Rydberg equation for each λ.

For the first line (n₂=2):
1/λ1 = R[(1/1²) - (1/2²)] = R[1 - 1/4] = R*(3/4)
So rearranging, R = (1/λ1) * (4/3)

Similarly, for the second line (n₂=3):
1/λ2 = R[(1/1²) - (1/3²)] = R[1 - 1/9] = R*(8/9)
So R = (1/λ2) * (9/8)

Now, I'll compute each R.

Starting with the first calculation:
λ1 = 1215.56e-8 cm → 1/λ1 = 1 / (1215.56e-8) cm⁻¹
Let me compute 1215.56e-8. So 1.21556e-5 cm. Wait, no, wait: 1e-8 is 0.00000001 cm per Angstrom. So 1215.56 Å is 1215.56 * 1e-8 cm = 1.21556e-5 cm.

So 1/λ1 = 1 / 1.21556e-5 cm = approximately 82327.98 cm⁻¹.

Then R = (82327.98) * (4/3) = 82327.98 * 1.333333...
Hmm, let's compute that. 82327.98 * 1.333333 is about 109694.64 cm⁻¹.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 82,327.98 * 4/3 is same as 82,327.98 * 1.3333. Let me compute 82,327.98 * 1.3333:

82,327.98 * 1 = 82,327.98
82,327.98 * 0.3333 ≈ 82,327.98 * 0.333 ≈ 27,442.66
Adding together: 82,327.98 + 27,442.66 = 109,770.64? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Oh wait, 82,327.98 is 1/λ, right? So 82,327.98 cm⁻¹ multiplied by 4/3 gives R.

Wait, 82,327.98 * (4/3) = (82,327.98 *4) /3. Let's compute 82,327.98 *4 = 329,311.92. Divide by 3: 329,311.92 /3 = 109,770.64 cm⁻¹. Hmm, but the actual value is 109,678, so this is a bit off. Let me check if I messed up the calculation.

Wait, wait, let me try a more precise approach. Let me compute 1215.56 exactly.

Wait, 1215.56 Å is 1215.56e-8 cm, which is 1.21556e-5 cm. So 1/λ1 = 1/(1.21556e-5) cm⁻¹ = 82327.989 cm⁻¹ approximately.

Now, 82327.989 * (4/3) = ?

Let me compute 82327.989 *4 = 329,311.956. Then divide by 3: 329,311.956 /3 = 109,770.3187 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, that's about 109,770.32 cm⁻¹. Okay, moving on to the second line.

Second line: λ2 = 1025.83 Å = 1025.83e-8 cm = 1.02583e-5 cm.

So 1/λ2 = 1 / 1.02583e-5 cm⁻¹ → let's compute this.

1/1.02583e-5 = approximately 97519.23 cm⁻¹.

Then R = (97519.23) * (9/8) = 97519.23 * 1.125.

Calculating that:

97519.23 * 1 = 97519.23
97519.23 * 0.125 = 97519.23 * (1/8) ≈ 12,189.904
So total R = 97519.23 + 12,189.904 = 109,709.134 cm⁻¹.

Wait a second, so R1 is approximately 109,770 cm⁻¹ and R2 is approximately 109,709 cm⁻¹.

Looking at the options, let's see which one has values around these numbers.

Option H is 109678 and 109688 — no, that's the actual value but our calculated values are higher and lower.

Option A: 109660 and 109680 — both lower than our R1 and R2.

Option B: 109675 and 109685 — both lower than our calculated.

Option C: 109655 and 109695 — R1 is 109770 which is higher than 109695.

Option D: 109690 and 109670 — wait, R1 is 109770, R2 is 109709. So the first R is higher than any D options.

Option E: 109645 and 109675 — lower than our R2.

Option F: 109700 and 109680 — R1 is 109770, which is higher than 109700, R2 is 109709, which is higher than 109680. So not matching.

Option G: 109650 and 109700 — R2 is 109709, which is just over 109700, but R1 is 109770, which is above.

Option H: 109678 and 109688 — again, not our values.

Option I: 109690 and 109660. R2 is ~109709, which is higher than 109690, and R1 is 109770.

Option J: 109689 and 109667 — again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake somewhere. Let me double-check the first calculation.

First line:

λ1 = 1215.56 Å = 1215.56e-8 cm = 1.21556e-5 cm.

1/λ1 = 1 / 1.21556e-5 = approx 82327.989 cm⁻¹.

R = (1/λ1) * (4/3) → 82327.989 * 4/3 = (82327.989 *4)=329311.956 /3 = 109770.318 cm⁻¹.

Wait, but the actual R is 109678 cm⁻¹, so this is a bit higher, but perhaps due to rounding during calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should do more precise calculations. Let's try with more exact numbers.

Alternative approach: Compute 1/λ in cm⁻¹, then compute R.

Compute R for each line.

First line:

λ1 = 1215.56 Å = 1215.56e-8 cm.

1/λ1 = 1/(1215.56e-8) = 1/(1.21556e-5) = 82327.989 cm⁻¹.

Multiply by (4/3):

R1 = 82327.989 * (4/3) = 82327.989 * 1.3333333... Let's compute this more accurately.

82327.989 * 1.3333333.

I'll compute 82327.989 × 4 = 329,311.956.

Divide by 3: 329,311.956 /3 = 109,770.318666... So approximately 109,770.32 cm⁻¹.

Second line:

λ2 = 1025.83 Å = 1025.83e-8 cm = 1.02583e-5 cm.

1/λ2 = 1/(1.02583e-5) ≈ 97519.23 cm⁻¹.

Multiply by (9/8) → 97519.23 * 1.125.

Compute 97519.23 × 9 = 877,473.07, then divide by 8 → 109,684.135 cm⁻¹.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 9/8 is 1.125. So:

97519.23 × 1.125.

Let me compute this precisely.

97519.23 × 1 = 97519.23

97519.23 × 0.125 → 97519.23 * (1/8) = 12,189.904.

So total is 97519.23 + 12,189.904 = 109,709.134 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, so R1 is 109,770.32 and R2 is 109,709.13.

Looking back at the options, which pair is close to these?

Looking at the options:

Option A: 109,660 and 109,680 → both lower.

Option B: 109,675 and 109,685 → lower.

Option C: 109,655 and 109,695 → R1 is 109,770 (higher than 109,695), R2 is 109,709 (higher than 109,695).

Option D: 109,690 and 109,670 → R1 is higher, R2 is higher than both.

Option E: 109,645 and 109,675 → lower.

Option F: 109,700 and 109,680 → R1 is 109,770 (higher than 109,700), R2 is 109,709 (higher than 109,680).

Option G: 109,650 and 109,700 → R1 is higher than 109,700, R2 is higher than 109,700.

Option H: 109,678 and 109,688 → both lower.

Option I: 109,690 and 109,660 → R1 is higher, R2 is higher than 109,690.

Option J: 109,689 and 109,667 → lower.

Wait, none of the options exactly match, but perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Let me check if I'm using the right formula.

Wait wait, the Rydberg equation is 1/λ = R (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²). So for the first line, n₂=2: 1/λ = R(1 - 1/4) = 3R/4 → R = (4)/(3λ).

Wait, but I think I did that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute R as R = 1/(λ*(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²)).

Wait, for the first line, n₁=1, n₂=2.

So 1/n₁² = 1, 1/n₂² = 1/4. So their difference is 3/4.

So R = (1/λ1) / (3/4) ) = (4)/(3λ1).

Wait, but 1/λ is in cm⁻¹, so R would have units cm⁻¹.

Wait, let me compute this again.

R1 = (1/λ1) * (4/3).

Hmm, I think I did it right.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the λ values.

Wait, let me compute 1/λ1 as 1/(1215.56e-8) = 1/(1.21556e-5) cm⁻¹.

Compute 1.21556e-5 = 0.0000121556 cm.

So 1 / 0.0000121556 = approximately 82,327.989 cm⁻¹.

Multiply by 4/3: 82,327.989 * 1.333333 = 109,770.32 cm⁻¹.

Similarly for the second line.

1/λ2 = 1/(1025.83e-8) = 1/(1.02583e-5) ≈ 97,519.23 cm⁻¹.

Multiply by 9/8: 97,519.23 * 1.125 = let's compute this.

97,519.23 × 1 = 97,519.23

97,519.23 × 0.125 = 12,189.904.

Adding: 97,519.23 + 12,189.904 = 109,709.134 cm⁻¹.

So R1 is approx 109,770.32, R2 is approx 109,709.13.

Looking for these values in the options.

Hmm, looking at the options:

Option A: 109,660 and 109,680 — both lower.

Option B: 109,675 and 109,685 — lower.

Option C: 109,655 and 109,695 — R2 is 109,709, which is higher than 109,695.

Option D: 109,690 and 109,670 — R1 is higher than 109,690, R2 is higher than 109,670.

Option E: 109,645 and 109,675 — lower.

Option F: 109,700 and 109,680.

Wait, R1 is 109,770.32, which is higher than 109,700. R2 is 109,709, which is higher than 109,680.

So none of the options seem to match exactly. Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps I made an error in calculation.

Wait, perhaps the initial conversion is wrong. Let me check that.

Wait, 1 Angstrom is 1e-8 cm, correct.

So 1215.56 Angstroms is 1215.56e-8 cm.

But 1215.56e-8 cm is 1.21556e-5 cm, correct.

So 1/λ1 is 1/(1.21556e-5) cm⁻¹ → 82,327.989 cm⁻¹.

Similarly for the second line.

Wait, perhaps I should try doing exact calculations with fractions to avoid rounding errors.

Alternatively, perhaps the given λ values are in Angstroms, and perhaps I should convert them into cm correctly.

Wait, 1 m is 1e10 Angstroms, so 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 m = 1e-8 cm.

So yes, correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute 1/(λ in cm) without converting to float numbers.

Wait, 1215.56e-8 cm is 1.21556e-5 cm.

1 divided by 1.21556e-5 is approximately 82327.989 cm⁻¹.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/1.21556e-5 more accurately.

Let me compute 1.21556e-5 = 0.0000121556.

So 1 / 0.0000121556 = ?

Let me compute 1 / 0.0000121556.

Well, 0.00001 is 1e-5, so 1/1e-5 is 1e5 = 100,000.

But 0.0000121556 is 1.21556e-5.

So 1/(1.21556e-5) = (1e5) / 1.21556 ≈ 82327.989.

Yes, correct.

So R1 = 82327.989 * (4/3) = 109,770.32 cm⁻¹.

Similarly, R2.

1.02583e-5 cm → 1/(1.02583e-5) ≈ 97519.23 cm⁻¹.

Multiply by (9/8) → 109,709.13 cm⁻¹.

Looking at the options, perhaps the closest is option J: 109,689 and 109,667. No, wait, those are lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the second R.

Wait, let me compute R2 again.

Second line: λ2 = 1025.83 Å → 1.02583e-5 cm.

1/λ2 = 1/(1.02583e-5) → let me compute this accurately.

1.02583e-5 is 0.0000102583.

1 / 0.0000102583 = approximately 97519.23 cm⁻¹.

Now, R = 97519.23 * (9/8) → 97519.23 * 1.125.

Compute 97519.23 * 1.125.

Let me do it step by step.

97519.23 × 1 = 97,519.23

97519.23 × 0.125 = ?

Well, 0.125 is 1/8. So 97,519.23 ÷8 = 12,189.904.

So 97,519.23 + 12,189.904 = 109,709.134 cm⁻¹.

So R2 is approximately 109,709.13 cm⁻¹.

Looking at the options, none of them have both values. Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Wait, looking at option H: 109,678 and 109,688. But our R1 is 109,770, which is higher.

Option I: 109,690 and 109,660. R1 is higher, R2 is
