Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a propeller blade. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question says the propeller blade is treated as a uniform rigid rod. So, I remember that for rotational motion, when an object is rotating, there's something called centrifugal force acting on it. Oh wait, but wait, centrifugal force is a bit tricky because it's a pseudo-force, but in this case, since the problem is asking about the outward force the blade exerts on the socket, I guess we can model it as if the blade is trying to fly outwards due to rotation.

The blade is 2 meters long and has a mass of 50 kg. It's rotating at 2200 rpm about one end. So, I think I need to find the centrifugal force acting on the blade. Wait, the formula for centrifugal force is m * ω² * r, right? Where m is mass, ω is angular velocity in radians per second, and r is the distance from the axis of rotation.

Let me jot down the known values:

Mass (m) = 50 kg
Length (r) = 2 m
Rotational speed (N) = 2200 rpm

First, I need to convert rpm to radians per second because ω is in rad/s. The conversion factor is that 1 rpm equals (2π/60) rad/s. So, ω = 2200 * (2π/60). Let me compute that.

2200 divided by 60 is approximately 36.6667. Then multiply by 2π: 36.6667 * 2 * π ≈ 36.6667 * 6.2832 ≈ let's calculate that. 36 times 6 is 216, 0.6667 *6 is about 4, so 220. Then the exact value would be 36.6667 * 6.2832 = approximately 230.11 rad/s.

Wait, wait, let me do it more accurately. 2200 rpm. So 2200 /60 = 36.6666667. 36.6666667 * 2 =73.3333333, then multiplied by π (approx 3.1416). So 73.3333333 *3.1416 ≈ Let's compute 70 *3.1416 is 219.912, and 3.333333 *3.1416 is about 10.47195. So total is 219.912 +10.47195 ≈ 230.384. So ω ≈ 230.384 rad/s.

Now, the centrifugal force F is m * ω² * r. So plug in the numbers:

m =50 kg
r=2 m

So F =50 * (230.384)^2 * 2. Let's compute (230.384)^2 first.

230 squared is 52900. 0.384 squared is about 0.147, and cross terms 2*230*0.384 = 176.64. So (230.384)^2 ≈ 52900 + (2*230*.384) + (.384)^2 ≈ 52900 + 176.64 + 0.147 ≈ 53076.787.

So ω squared is roughly 53076.787 rad²/s².

Now F =50 * 53076.787 * 2. Let's compute 50*2=100. So 100 *53076.787 =5,307,678.7 Newtons.

Wait, but wait a minute. Hold on, that's a huge number. Let me check my calculations again because that seems way too big.

Wait, 230 squared is 52900. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in computing (230.384)^2. Because 230 is 23^2 * 10^2, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me calculate 230.384^2:

230.384 *230.384.

Let me break it down:

230 * 230 = 52900.

230 * 0.384 = 88.32.

0.384 *230 = same as above, 88.32.

0.384 *0.384 = approx 0.147456.

So expanding (a+b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b² where a=230, b=0.384.

So (230.384)^2 = (230)^2 + 2*(230)(0.384) + (0.384)^2.

So that's 52900 + 2*(88.32) + 0.147456.

So 2*88.32 is 176.64. So adding up: 52900 + 176.64 = 53076.64, then +0.147456 gives 53076.787456.

So that part is correct. So ω² is about 53076.787.

So F =50 kg * 53076.787 * 2 m.

Wait, 50 * 53076.787 = 2,653,839.35. Then multiply by 2 gives 5,307,678.7 N. Oh wait, no, wait: 50 kg * (ω squared) * r.

Wait no, wait F = m * ω² * r. So that's 50 * (53076.787) * 2. So 50 * 53076.787 = 2,653,839.35. Multiply by 2 gives 5,307,678.7 N. Oh wow, that's about 5.3e6 N. But looking at the options, the highest option is J:5.65e6. So 5.3e6 is close to that, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute ω more accurately. Let me recompute ω:

2200 rpm = 2200 * (2π) /60 rad/s.

2200 /60 = 36.6666667. Multiply by 2π:

36.6666667 * 2 =73.3333333. 73.3333333 * π. Let me compute π as 3.1415926536.

So 73.3333333 *3.1415926536:

Compute 70 *3.1415926536 = 219.9129732.

3.3333333 *3.1415926536 ≈ 10.471975512.

So adding 219.9129732 +10.471975512 = 230.3849487 rad/s.

So ω is approximately 230.3849487 rad/s.

So ω squared is (230.3849487)^2.

Let me compute 230.3849487 squared:

I'll compute 230^2 =52900.

Then 0.3849487^2 ≈ 0.148 (approx).

Then cross term: 2 *230 *0.3849487 =2*230=460 *0.3849487.

Compute 460 *0.3 =138, 460 *0.0849487≈460*0.08=36.8, 460*0.0049487≈2.277. So 36.8 +2.277≈39.077. So 138 +39.077=177.077.

So adding 52900 +177.077 +0.148= 53077.225.

So ω²≈53077.225 rad²/s².

Now, F = m ω² r =50 kg *53077.225 *2 m.

Compute 50 *2=100.

100 *53077.225 =5,307,722.5 N.

Hmm, about 5.307e6 N.

Looking at the options:

Option J is 5.65e6, which doesn't match. Wait, but wait. Did I perhaps make a mistake in units somewhere? Let's double-check the problem statement.

Ah, wait, the blade is 2m long, so the radius r is 2m. Correct.

Mass is 50 kg. Correct.

Rotation is about one end, so the center of mass is at r=1m? Wait, wait—I think I might have made a mistake here. Because if the propeller is treated as a uniform rod rotating about one end, the center of mass is at the center of the rod. So for a rod of length L rotating about one end, the center of mass is at L/2. So for L=2m, the center is at 1m from the axis.

Wait, wait, no! Wait, no, the formula I used earlier was F = m ω² r, where r is the distance from the axis. But in that formula, r would be the distance from the axis to the center of mass, which is 1m, not 2m.

Oh no! So I think I made a mistake. I used r=2m, but actually, for a rod rotating about one end, the center of mass is at L/2, so r=1m. So that changes everything.

So correcting that, r=1m.

So F = m ω² r =50 kg * (230.3849487)^2 *1 m.

So let's compute this.

ω² is 53077.225, as before.

So F=50 *53077.225 *1 =50 *53077.225 =2,653,861.25 N.

Which is approximately 2.65e6 N. Now looking at the options, option B is 2.65e6 N. Option A is 2.65e5, which is an order of magnitude smaller.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the centrifugal force on a rotating rod about one end—does the formula account for the entire mass being at the center, or is there another consideration? Because the formula F = m ω² r is correct for a point mass at distance r. But for a uniform rod, the calculation might be different because each infinitesimal mass element is at a different radius. Wait, but no, because when you treat it as a point mass at the center of mass, the formula still holds. So the approach is correct.

Wait, but when the rod is rotating about one end, the center of mass is at L/2, so the formula F = m ω² (L/2) is correct.

So in this case, F =50 kg * (230.3849487)^2 * (2m / 2) => 50 * (230.3849487)^2 * 1m.

Which gives about 2.65e6 N, so option B.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation with r=1m.

Compute F=50 * (230.3849)^2 *1.

We have (230.3849)^2 = (approx) 53077.225.

So 50 *53077.225 = 2,653,861.25 N, which is 2.65e6 N. So option B is 2.65 ×10^6 N, which is choice B.

So the correct answer should be B.
</think>

To solve the problem, we treat the propeller blade as a uniform rigid rod rotating about one end. The outward force exerted by the blade on the socket is equivalent to the centrifugal force, which is given by:

\[
F = m \cdot \omega^2 \cdot r
\]

### Known values:
- Mass of the blade: \( m = 50 \, \text{kg} \)
- Length of the blade: \( L = 2 \, \text{m} \)
- Rotational speed: \( N = 2200 \, \text{rpm} \)

### Step 1: Convert rotational speed to angular velocity (\( \omega \))
The conversion factor is \( 1 \, \text{rpm} = \frac{2\pi}{60} \, \text{rad/s} \). Thus:

\[
\omega = 2200 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{60} = 36.6667 \cdot 2\pi \approx 230.3849 \, \text{rad/s}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the effective radius (\( r \))
For a uniform rod rotating about one end, the center of mass is located at \( r = \frac{L}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \, \text{m} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the centrifugal force
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
F = m \cdot \omega^2 \cdot r
\]

First, compute \( \omega^2 \):

\[
\omega^2 = (230.3849)^2 \approx 53077.225 \, \text{rad}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

Now calculate \( F \):

\[
F = 50 \cdot 53077.225 \cdot 1 \approx 2,653,861.25 \, \text{N}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated force is approximately \( 2.65 \times 10^6 \, \text{N} \), which corresponds to **option B**.
