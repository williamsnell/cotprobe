Question:

A teacher sets up a reward system for her elementary school students. At the end of each day, she gives a sticker to each student who showed up on time that morning. At the end of each week, she gives a sticker to any student who got above a 90% on three quizzes in a row. After months of this regimen, she finds that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but that tardiness has only decreased slightly. Which of the following best explains the teacher’s observation?

Options:

A: The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.
B: The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a variable-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.
C: The students were more excited about the quizzes than about the reward system.
D: The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a variable-interval schedule than it was to a fixed-ratio schedule.
E: Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.
F: The students’ behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.
G: The students' behavior change was weaker in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.
H: The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-interval schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.
I: The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a continuous reinforcement schedule than it was to a variable-ratio schedule.
J: The students’ behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question about operant conditioning and reinforcement schedules. Let me break it down.

The scenario is about a teacher who set up a reward system. There are two rewards here: one for showing up on time each day and another for scoring above 90% on three quizzes in a row at the end of each week. After months, quiz performance improved a lot, but tardiness only decreased a little. I need to explain why that happened.

First, I remember that operant conditioning is all about how behavior is modified by reinforcement or punishment. There are different types of reinforcement schedules, right? Like continuous, fixed-ratio, variable-ratio, fixed-interval, variable-interval.

So for the stickers: the daily attendance reward is given every day the student is on time. That sounds like a continuous reinforcement schedule because the student gets a reward every time they perform the desired behavior (showing up on time). On the other hand, the quiz reward is given once a week if they score above 90% on three quizzes in a row. That seems more like a fixed-interval schedule because the reward is given after a set period (a week) and a certain number of desired behaviors (three good quiz scores).

Wait, but wait. Or is it a variable ratio? No, because it's not based on an unpredictable number of responses. It's a specific number each week. Hmm, maybe it's a fixed ratio because they have to get three in a row. Or perhaps it's a fixed interval because the reward is given weekly, regardless of how many quizzes they take in between, but in this case, it's specifically three quizzes each week.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the types. Let me think again. Fixed interval is when you reward after a set time period, like every week. Variable interval is when the time varies, like sometimes after 3 days, sometimes 7, unpredictably. Fixed ratio is rewards after a set number of responses, like every 5th behavior. Variable ratio is after an unpredictable number, which is known to create high and steady response rates, like gambling.

So for the attendance, the reward is every day they come on time. So continuous reinforcement because every instance is rewarded.

For the quizzes, the reward is given once a week if they met the three-quiz criteria. So that's a fixed interval schedule because the reward is based on a time period (a week). Alternatively, it's a fixed ratio if it's based on the number of quizzes. Wait, the question says "three quizzes in a row". So maybe the student has to get three high scores consecutively, but that doesn't directly tie to a ratio.

Wait, perhaps the quizzes are given each day, and the reward is at the end of the week if they had three in a row. So the number is fixed, but the timing is weekly. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the quizzes happen three times a week, and if you score above 90% on all three, you get a sticker on Friday. So it's a fixed ratio (three correct responses) leading to a reward. Or fixed interval because it's a week.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the two rewards:

1. Attendance: Sticker every day they're on time. Continuous reinforcement (CRF) because every correct behavior is rewarded.

2. Quizzes: At the end of the week, if you've done well on three in a row, you get a sticker. So it's not every week, but dependent on performance. Wait, maybe it's a fixed ratio. Because the student has to get three correct quizzes in a row, so after every three correct responses, they get a reward. But that's only if it's three in a row without missing. So that's a fixed ratio of three, but it's also dependent on consecutive successes. So perhaps it's a fixed ratio schedule with a dependency on consecutive correct responses.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a fixed interval because the reward is given weekly, but the number of quizzes varies. But in the question, it's three in a row. So perhaps the teacher gives a quiz each day, and if a student scores above 90% on three consecutive days, they get the sticker at the end of the week. So the timing is based on three responses, making it a fixed ratio (3) schedule, but the reward is given at the end of the week, which might combine both ratio and interval aspects. Hmm, maybe that's complicating it.

But stepping back, the key here is the effectiveness of the reinforcement. The quiz performance improved a lot, but attendance only slightly. So the quiz reward was more effective in changing behavior than the attendance reward.

Now, which schedule is more effective? I remember that variable ratio schedules produce the highest response rates and are more resistant to extinction. Continuous reinforcement is quick to establish but quick to extinguish. Fixed interval schedules tend to produce slower responses but a burst at the end before the reward.

Wait, but in this case, the attendance is CRF (continuous), so every day you get a reward. Quiz is perhaps fixed ratio (3 responses) or fixed interval (weekly). So which schedule would lead to stronger behavior change?

Wait, another angle: the fact that the quiz reward is given weekly but only if they have three in a row. So maybe it's a variable ratio because you don't know exactly when the reward comes? Or perhaps it's a fixed ratio because it's after three correct responses.

Alternatively, maybe the attendance is on CRF, which is a strong schedule but perhaps leads to faster extinction if the reward stops. But the quizzes have a different schedule.

Wait, let me recall: 

- Continuous reinforcement (CRF): every desired response is rewarded. Behavior is learned quickly but extinguished quickly if rewards stop.

- Fixed ratio (FR): reward after a fixed number of responses. High, steady response rates, more resistant to extinction than CRF.

- Variable ratio (VR): reward after unpredictable number of responses. Highest resistance to extinction, creates high and steady responding.

- Fixed interval (FI): reward after a fixed time period. Leads to slower responding, with an increase as the interval approaches.

- Variable interval (VI): reward after unpredictable time. Moderate resistance.

So in our case, attendance is CRF (reward every day), which is very effective at establishing behavior quickly but not as good at maintaining it over time. But the quiz reward: if it's based on three correct in a row, that's a fixed ratio of 3. So FR schedules tend to have higher resistance to extinction than CRF. Alternatively, if the quiz reward is given once a week, it might be more of a fixed interval.

Wait, the question says that the quiz reward is given at the end of each week for any student who got above 90% on three quizzes in a row. So perhaps each week, the student can earn a sticker if they meet the criteria that week. So it's not a fixed ratio across weeks, but each week is an opportunity. So maybe the quizzes are given multiple times each week, and if they have three in a row (on any days) that week, then they get a sticker.

Alternatively, perhaps the quizzes are given each day, and the reward is given for three in a row. So if they have three correct in a row, they get a reward. So that's a fixed ratio of three consecutive correct responses.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact schedule. Let me think about the outcome. The quiz performance improved a lot, while attendance only slightly. So the quiz reward was more motivating.

Which schedule is more effective? CRF (attendance) is typically good but maybe not as strong as other schedules in maintaining behavior. Wait, no. Wait, CRF is the strongest for establishing behavior, but the question is about long-term change.

Wait, but in this scenario, the rewards have been given for months. So the attendance is on CRF, while the quiz is on some other schedule. The quiz showed more improvement, so perhaps the quiz's schedule is more effective in maintaining behavior.

Wait, but which schedule is more effective for long-term behavior change? Variable ratio schedules are known to produce the most persistent behavior, but in this case, the quiz might be on a fixed ratio or fixed interval.

Alternatively, if the quiz reward is given weekly based on three in a row, perhaps it's a fixed-interval schedule with a set number of required responses. So maybe it's a combination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the teacher is using two different reinforcement schedules. Attendance is CRF (reward every day), while the quiz is on a variable ratio or fixed interval. 

But why was the quiz reward more effective? Because the quiz's reinforcement schedule was more powerful. For instance, if the quiz was on a variable ratio, that would explain higher effectiveness. But in the scenario, it's end of the week for three in a row, which sounds more like a fixed ratio.

Wait, maybe the quiz is on a variable-interval schedule. Because the students don't know exactly when the reward will come, but no, because it's at the end of each week, so it's fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the attendance reward is given immediately each day (continuous), but the quiz reward is given weekly but after three correct quizzes. So for the quiz, each correct quiz is a step towards the reward, but the timing is weekly. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the quiz reward is a fixed-interval schedule, given every week, but the number of quizzes varies. So the student knows that at the end of the week, their performance over the week is assessed. So it's more like an FI schedule. FI schedules tend to produce improvement that's maintained over time, but I thought they might not be as strong as variable ratio.

But in this case, the quiz performance improved more than attendance. So why would FI be better than CRF? Because CRF is typically for quick learning, but perhaps less resistant to extinction. Wait, but in this case, the rewards have been given for months, so both are being maintained, but quiz performance improved more. So perhaps the schedule for the quizzes is more effective.

Wait, another point: the students are elementary school. Maybe the daily reward is smaller, but quiz reward is more valued. But the question doesn't mention the size of the reward, so perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the type of behavior. Quizzes are directly tied to academic performance, which may have intrinsic motivation as well, but the question states that performance increased due to the reward system, so it's likely about the extrinsic rewards.

Wait, let me think about the options given.

The options are A through J. Let's look at them:

Option B: The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a variable-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.

Would that fit? If the quiz was on variable ratio, but in this case, it's weekly, so probably not variable ratio.

Option E: Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is least susceptible to extinction.

But in the question, the quiz reward isn't variable ratio.

Option B says variable ratio better than continuous. But if the attendance is CRF and quiz is FR or FI, which would be better.

Wait, another thought. The quiz reward might be on a fixed ratio because it's given after three correct quizzes. So fixed ratio 3. Fixed ratio schedules produce high, steady responding and are more resistant to extinction than CRF, which is what the attendance uses. So if the quiz is FR and attendance is CRF, then the quiz's FR would lead to stronger behavior change than the CRF for attendance. So why then did the quiz performance improve more?

Wait, in that case, the quiz's FR would lead to better behavior change than the attendance's CRF. But wait, no, I thought CRF is better for establishing behavior, but FR is better for maintaining.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me check my notes: CRF is the quickest to establish a response, but FR schedules produce higher rates of responding and are more resistant to extinction. So if attendance is CRF and quiz is FR, then the quiz's reinforcement is more effective in maintaining behavior. So the quiz, which is FR, would have a stronger effect, leading to greater improvement.

But wait, the options don't directly state that. Let me look through the options again.

Option B: variable ratio stronger than CRF.

Option D: stronger response to variable interval than fixed ratio.

Option E: variable ratio is strongest and least susceptible.

Option F: fixed ratio stronger than CRF.

Option I: CRF stronger than variable ratio.

Wait, option F says that the students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed ratio than to a continuous reinforcement schedule.

In our scenario, quiz performance (FR) improved more than attendance (CRF). So this would mean that FR is more effective than CRF, which would support option F.

But wait, I thought CRF was better for establishing, but FR for maintaining. But if the teacher has been doing this for months, then the question is about maintenance. So FR would maintain better than CRF. So in this case, quiz (FR) would lead to better performance than attendance (CRF), which aligns with what the teacher observed.

So option F says the behavior change was stronger with FR than CRF. That would explain why quizzes improved more.

Alternatively, let's think about the attendance reward. If it's a continuous schedule, the student gets a reward every day they attend. That might lead to quick acquisition but perhaps the behavior isn't as strongly maintained. Whereas the quiz reward, being FR, leads to a stronger, more persistent behavior.

Wait, but some sources say that variable ratio is more resistant than fixed ratio. So maybe the quiz is on a variable ratio. But in the question, it's given weekly, so probably fixed interval or fixed ratio.

Wait, maybe the quiz is a variable ratio because the student doesn't know exactly when they'll reach three correct in a row. But that's not accurate because once they have three correct, they get the reward. So it's a fixed ratio of three.

So then, comparing CRF (attendance) and FR3 (quiz): the FR would produce a higher rate of responding and be more resistant to extinction. So the quiz's FR schedule leads to better performance than the CRF for attendance.

So the correct option would be F: The students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.

Wait, but looking back, the quiz reward is given after three correct quizzes in a row, but only once a week. So maybe it's a combination of fixed ratio and fixed interval. Because the student needs to achieve three correct in a row, but the reward is given at the end of the week.

Alternatively, perhaps the quizzes are given three times a week, and if all three are above 90%, the reward is given. So that's a fixed ratio of three responses leading to a reward, making it FR3. So the quiz is FR3, attendance is CRF.

So the correct option would be F.
</think>

The teacher implemented two reinforcement schedules: a continuous reinforcement schedule (CRF) for attendance, where students received a sticker every day they arrived on time, and a fixed-ratio schedule (FR) for quiz performance, where students received a sticker at the end of the week if they scored above 90% on three consecutive quizzes. After months, quiz performance improved significantly, while tardiness decreased only slightly.

This discrepancy can be explained by the nature of the reinforcement schedules. Continuous reinforcement (CRF) is effective for quickly establishing behavior but is less effective at maintaining it over time. In contrast, fixed-ratio schedules (FR), where rewards are given after a set number of desired responses, produce higher and more consistent response rates and are more resistant to extinction. In this case, the quiz reward (FR3) was more effective in driving long-term behavior change compared to the attendance reward (CRF), leading to greater improvement in quiz performance.

The correct explanation is that the students' behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.

Answer: F
