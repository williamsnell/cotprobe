Question:

A state legislature has recently enacted an obscenity statute prohibiting "the selling or offering for sale of any obscene printed or video materials. " Following numerous complaints from a local citizens' group, the police entered an adult bookstore, examined materials on the shelves, and purchased magazines that depicted actual pictures of sexual intercourse. The owner was subsequently arrested and charged with violating the state obscenity law. At his trial, the owner's defense was that the sale of the materials complained of was constitutionally protected speech. Which of the following, if established, would be most helpful to the owner's defense?

Options:

A: The bookstore had a strict policy against selling to minors.
B: The particular materials involved were sold to consenting adults only.
C: The particular materials involved consisted of serious scientific studies of human sexual urges.
D: The police did not have a search warrant when they entered the bookstore to purchase the particular materials involved in this obscenity prosecution.
E: The particular materials involved were part of a larger collection of non-explicit content.
F: The particular materials involved depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct.
G: The particular materials were imported and not produced in the state.
H: 85% of the citizens of the state believe that the sale of sexually explicit material does not contribute to antisocial sexual behavior.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about obscenity law and constitutional protections. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it carefully.

The question is about a state legislature that passed an obscenity statute prohibiting the sale or offering for sale of any obscene printed or video materials. The police went into an adult bookstore, looked around, bought some magazines showing actual sexual intercourse, and the owner got arrested. At trial, the owner's defense is that selling these materials is protected speech. The question is asking which fact would help the owner's defense the most.

First, I need to remember what the legal standard is for obscenity. I recall that the Supreme Court has set a test for determining whether material is obscene, and thus not protected by the First Amendment. The test from Miller v. California (1973) comes to mind. The Miller test has three parts, and all must be met for material to be considered obscene:

1. Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest.
2. Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law.
3. Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

So, the defense would aim to show that the material doesn't meet all three parts of this test. If the material has serious value, even if it's sexually explicit, it's protected.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: The bookstore had a strict policy against selling to minors. That's about restricting access to minors, but the case here is about selling to adults. I don't think this directly affects the obscenity determination because the materials are still being sold, just not to minors. So maybe not the best defense.

Option B: The materials were sold to consenting adults only. Again, selling to adults doesn't negate the possibility of the material being obscene. The Miller test doesn't care about the audience's age as long as the material meets the three prongs. So this might not help much.

Option C: The materials were serious scientific studies of human sexual urges. This seems relevant because the third prong of the Miller test is about serious valueâ€”scientific studies would likely have serious scientific value. If the material is part of a genuine scientific study, it might not be considered obscene because it has that value. So this option could be a strong point for the defense.

Option D: The police didn't have a search warrant. This is about the legality of the police's entry. If they entered without a warrant, any evidence obtained might be excluded. But the question is about the defense that the sale is constitutionally protected. So even if the evidence is thrown out, the underlying charge's constitutionality isn't directly addressed. The owner's defense here is about the material being protected speech, not about procedural police issues. So D might be a different issue, perhaps a due process or Fourth Amendment claim, but not directly about the obscenity law's application.

Option E: The materials were part of a larger collection of non-explicit content. I'm not sure how this helps. Just because there's more non-explicit material doesn't change the nature of the specific materials in question. The test is about each work individually, so this might not matter.

Option F: The materials depicted normal, not deviant, sexual conduct. The Miller test includes whether the conduct is patently offensive, but I think deviant vs. normal might not be the main factor. It's more about how it's depicted. So I'm not sure this helps much.

Option G: The materials were imported, not produced in-state. This might relate to interstate commerce, but I don't see how that directly impacts the obscenity determination. The law here is a state law, so whether it's imported or not doesn't change the material's content.

Option H: 85% of citizens believe the sale doesn't contribute to antisocial behavior. This is about public opinion on the effects of the material. But the Miller test is about community standards regarding prurient interest and offensiveness. However, the third prong is about the work's value, not public opinion on its effects. So maybe this isn't directly relevant. Plus, the test uses the average person's view, not a majority opinion.

So, the most helpful option seems to be Option C. The materials being serious scientific studies would likely satisfy the third prong of the Miller test, meaning the material isn't obscene and thus is protected speech. That would directly help the owner's defense.

To determine which fact would most help the owner's defense, it is essential to evaluate the options under the legal standard for obscenity established by the Supreme Court in *Miller v. California*. Under this test, material is obscene if it meets all three of the following criteria:

1. It appeals to the prurient interest based on contemporary community standards.
2. It depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, as defined by state law.
3. It lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

The defense would aim to show that the material does not meet all three prongs of this test. With this framework in mind, each option is analyzed as follows:

- **Option A**: A policy against selling to minors does not address the obscenity of the material itself and is irrelevant to the *Miller* test.  
- **Option B**: Selling to consenting adults only does not negate the potential obscenity of the material, as the *Miller* test focuses on the content, not the audience.  
- **Option C**: If the materials are serious scientific studies, this directly addresses the third prong of the *Miller* test by demonstrating that the material has serious scientific value, which would prevent it from being classified as obscene. This is the strongest defense.  
- **Option D**: The absence of a search warrant raises procedural concerns under the Fourth Amendment but does not directly challenge the constitutionality of the obscenity law or the classification of the material as obscene.  
- **Option E**: Being part of a larger collection of non-explicit content does not change the nature of the specific materials in question, as the *Miller* test evaluates each work individually.  
- **Option F**: Depicting "normal" sexual conduct does not necessarily prevent the material from being classified as obscene, as the test focuses on how the conduct is depicted and its offensive nature.  
- **Option G**: The origin of the materials (imported vs. produced in-state) is irrelevant to the obscenity determination.  
- **Option H**: Public opinion about the effects of the material is not a factor in the *Miller* test, which focuses on community standards of prurient interest and offensive conduct, as well as the material's value.

The most helpful fact for the owner's defense is **Option C**, as it directly addresses the third prong of the *Miller* test by establishing that the material has serious scientific value, thereby preventing it from being classified as obscene.
