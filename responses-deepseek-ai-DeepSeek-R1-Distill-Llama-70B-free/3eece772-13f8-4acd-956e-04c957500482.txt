Okay, so I've got this problem here about heat loss through an insulated tube, and I need to figure out the answer. Hmm, let's see what it's asking for.

The tube has an outside diameter of 3.0 inches, and it's covered with a 2-inch thick insulating material. Oh wait, wait, the thermal conductivity isn't constant—it varies with temperature. The formula given is k equals 0.4 plus 8e-4 times T, where T is in Fahrenheit. Oh right, that's a bit more complicated than the constant k I usually see.

The temperatures are given as the inside surface at 400°F and the outside surface at 150°F. We're supposed to find the rate of heat loss per foot of the tube length. The options are from A to J, all in Btu/hr per foot.

Wait, I remember that when the thermal conductivity varies with temperature, the approach is different than when k is constant. Normally, for constant k, we use Fourier's law: Q = (2πkL(T1 - T2))/ln(r2/r1), where r is the radius. But if k varies, we might have to integrate because k changes with T.

So the varying k is given as k = 0.4 + 8e-4 * T. Since the temperature varies across the insulation, we'll have to consider how k changes as we move through the material.

Let me think about the setup. The tube's outside diameter is 3 inches, so radius r2 is 1.5 inches. The insulation is 2 inches thick, so the inner radius of the insulation (r1) would be the tube's radius plus the insulation thickness? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the tube's outside diameter is 3 inches, so radius is 1.5 inches. The insulation is 2 inches thick, so the outer radius of the insulation would be 1.5 + 2 = 3.5 inches. So, r1 is 1.5 inches, r2 is 3.5 inches.

Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, the problem says the tube is 3 inches in outside diameter. So the tube's radius is 1.5 inches. The insulation is 2 inches thick, so the outer radius is 1.5 + 2 = 3.5 inches. So yes, r1 = 1.5 in, r2 = 3.5 in.

But wait, the units—everything needs to be consistent. Oh, but in heat transfer formulas, the units probably just cancel out as long as they're consistent, since it's a length ratio in the logarithm. So maybe inches are okay as long as they're in the same units.

So, Fourier's law for radial heat transfer in a cylindrical coordinate is:

Q = (2πL) * integral from r1 to r2 of ( (1/(k(T))) * T dr) ??? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's step back.

The general approach for variable k is to set up the differential equation. The heat flux q is given by q = -k dT/dr. But integrating this across the insulation.

Wait, so for steady-state conditions, the heat flux is constant through the material. So:

q = (2πr L)(-k dT/dr) ) = constant.

Wait, but L is the length of the tube, and r is the radius at a point. So:

q = - (2πr L) k dT/dr.

Since q is constant, we can write:

∫ (dr / (k(T) r)) ) = - ∫ (dT / (q/(2π L))) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to rearrange the equation.

Let me think again. The heat flux is q = (2πr L)(-k dT/dr).

So, q = - (2π L) k r dT/dr.

We can rearrange this to:

dT/dr = - q/(2 π L k r )

Wait, but solving for T as a function of r might be complicated. Alternatively, since q is constant, we can integrate from r1 to r2.

So integrating both sides:

∫ (from r1 to r2) ( (1/(k(T)) ) * (1/r) ) dr = ∫ (from T1 to T2) ( (dT) / (q/(2 π L)) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write:

q = (2 π L) ∫ (from T1 to T2) ( (k(T) ) / r ) dT ) ?

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me check the integral setup.

The equation is:

q = (2 π r L) (-k dT/dr )

We can rearrange to:

dT/dr = - q/(2 π r L k )

Separating variables:

dT = - [ q/(2 π L k ) ] * (1/r) dr 

But k is a function of T, so it's better to switch variables. Maybe express r in terms of T, but that could get messy.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the integral form of Fourier's law when k varies with T.

The formula is:

Q = (2 π L) / (ln(r2/r1)) ) * ∫ (from T1 to T2) k(T) dT 

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Q = (2 π L) * [ (1/(ln(r2/r1))) ) * ∫ (k(T) dT) ) ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. For variable k, the heat transfer rate is given by:

Q = (2 π L) / ln(r2/r1) ) * ∫ (from T1 to T2) k(T) dT 

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when k is constant, this would reduce to Q = (2 π L k (T2 - T1)) / ln(r2/r1). Wait, no, that would require the integral of k dT being k (T2 - T1), which is correct. So yes, that formula is correct when k is constant. So in that case, when k varies, the integral becomes ∫k(T) dT from T1 to T2.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the correct formula when k varies with T is:

Q = (2 π L) * [1/ln(r2/r1)] * ∫ (from T1 to T2) k(T) dT 

Wait, that doesn't seem right because when k is constant, the integral is k*(T2 - T1), and that gives the right formula. So yes, that's probably the way to go.

So in this problem, T1 is 400°F (inside surface), T2 is 150°F (outside surface). Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, the problem says the inside surface is 400°F, and the outside surface is 150°F. So T1 = 400°F, T2=150°F.

So the integral from T1 to T2 of k(T) dT is from 400 to 150, but since T2 < T1, the integral will be negative. But since Q is the heat loss, we'll take the absolute value.

So, let's compute the integral ∫ (from 400 to 150) [0.4 + 8e-4 T ] dT.

Compute that integral:

∫ [0.4 + 0.0008 T ] dT from 400 to 150.

The integral is:

0.4*T + 0.0008 * (T²/2) evaluated from 400 to 150.

So:

[0.4*T + 0.0004 T² ] from 400 to 150.

Compute at T=150:

0.4*150 = 60

0.0004*(150)^2 = 0.0004 * 22500 = 9. So 60 +9 =69.

Compute at T=400:

0.4*400=160.

0.0004*(400)^2 = 0.0004 * 160000 = 64.

So 160 +64=224.

So the integral from 400 to 150 is 69 -224 = -155.

But since we're integrating from higher to lower, the result is negative, but the heat transfer should be positive, so we'll take absolute value. So the integral is 155.

Wait, no—actually, the integral from T1=400 to T2=150 is negative, but when I calculate as [F(150) - F(400)] it's 69 - 224 = -155. So when I take the integral from Ti=400 to To=150, it's -155. But in the formula, it's ∫ from T1 to T2, which is ∫400→150, which is negative. So the formula gives Q as (2πL / ln(r2/r1)) * (-155). But since Q is heat loss (positive), we'll take the absolute value, so it's 155.

So the integral is 155.

So now, compute the rest.

First, compute r2/r1. r1 =1.5 inches, r2 =3.5 inches. So r2/r1=3.5/1.5=7/3≈2.3333.

ln(r2/r1)=ln(7/3)=ln(2.3333)= approx 0.8473.

Wait, let me compute it accurately. 7/3 is about 2.3333. ln(2) is about 0.6931, ln(2.333)= let's see, e^0.847 is approx e^0.8 is about 2.2255, e^0.85 is about 2.34, which is close to 2.333, so ln(2.333)= approx 0.847.

So ln(r2/r1)=0.8473.

So now, compute Q:

Q = (2 * π * L) * (1 / 0.8473) ) * 155.

Wait, but L is the length, which the problem says is per foot, so L=1 ft.

So Q= 2 * π * 1 * (155 / 0.8473 )

Wait, 155 divided by 0.8473 is approximately 155 / 0.8473 ≈ let's compute that.

0.8473 * 182 ≈ 155, because 0.8473 * 180= 152.614, 0.8473*2=1.6946, so 180+2=182 gives 152.614+1.6946≈154.3086, which is close to 155. So 155 / 0.8473 ≈ 182.8.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute 0.8473 * 182.8 = ?

Let me think: 0.8473 * 180 = 152.614.

0.8473 * 2.8 = approx 2.37.

So 152.614 +2.37≈154.984. Close to 155.

So 155 / 0.8473 ≈182.8.

So Q= 2 * π * 182.8.

Compute 2 * π ≈6.2832.

6.2832 *182.8 ≈ let's compute that.

6 *182.8=1096.8

0.2832 *182.8≈approx 0.2832*180=50.976, 0.2832*2.8≈0.792. So 50.976+0.792=51.768.

So total Q≈1096.8 +51.768=1148.568 Btu/hr per foot.

Looking at the options, option I is 1148 Btu/hr per foot. So the answer should be I.

To determine the rate of heat loss per foot length of the tube, we use the formula for heat transfer in a cylindrical geometry with a thermal conductivity \( k \) that varies with temperature:

\[
Q = \frac{2 \pi L}{\ln(r_2 / r_1)} \int_{T_1}^{T_2} k(T) \, dT
\]

### Given Data:
- **Outer diameter of the tube**: \( 3.0 \, \text{in} \), so \( r_1 = 1.5 \, \text{in} \).
- **Insulation thickness**: \( 2.0 \, \text{in} \), so \( r_2 = 3.5 \, \text{in} \).
- **Thermal conductivity**: \( k(T) = 0.4 + 8 \times 10^{-4} T \), where \( T \) is in \(^\circ \text{F} \).
- **Inside surface temperature**: \( T_1 = 400^\circ \text{F} \).
- **Outside surface temperature**: \( T_2 = 150^\circ \text{F} \).
- **Length of the tube**: \( L = 1 \, \text{ft} \).

### Step 1: Compute the integral \( \int_{T_1}^{T_2} k(T) \, dT \)
The integral of \( k(T) = 0.4 + 8 \times 10^{-4} T \) is:

\[
\int_{T_1}^{T_2} k(T) \, dT = \int_{T_1}^{T_2} \left( 0.4 + 8 \times 10^{-4} T \right) \, dT
\]

\[
= \left[ 0.4 T + 8 \times 10^{-4} \frac{T^2}{2} \right]_{T_1}^{T_2}
\]

\[
= \left[ 0.4 T + 0.0004 T^2 \right]_{T_1}^{T_2}
\]

Evaluate at \( T_2 = 150^\circ \text{F} \):

\[
0.4(150) + 0.0004(150)^2 = 60 + 9 = 69
\]

Evaluate at \( T_1 = 400^\circ \text{F} \):

\[
0.4(400) + 0.0004(400)^2 = 160 + 64 = 224
\]

The integral is:

\[
\int_{T_1}^{T_2} k(T) \, dT = 69 - 224 = -155
\]

Since the result is negative, take the absolute value:

\[
\int_{T_1}^{T_2} k(T) \, dT = 155
\]

### Step 2: Compute the logarithmic term \( \ln(r_2 / r_1) \)
\[
r_2 / r_1 = \frac{3.5}{1.5} = 2.3333
\]

\[
\ln(r_2 / r_1) = \ln(2.3333) \approx 0.8473
\]

### Step 3: Compute the heat transfer rate \( Q \)
Substitute into the formula:

\[
Q = \frac{2 \pi L}{\ln(r_2 / r_1)} \int_{T_1}^{T_2} k(T) \, dT
\]

\[
Q = \frac{2 \pi (1)}{0.8473} (155)
\]

\[
Q = \frac{2 \pi}{0.8473} (155)
\]

First, compute \( 2 \pi \):

\[
2 \pi \approx 6.2832
\]

Now divide by \( 0.8473 \):

\[
\frac{6.2832}{0.8473} \approx 7.415
\]

Multiply by \( 155 \):

\[
Q \approx 7.415 \times 155 \approx 1148.5 \, \text{Btu/hr per foot}
\]

### Final Answer:
The rate of heat loss per foot length of the tube is approximately **1148 Btu/hr per foot**, which corresponds to **option I**.
