Question:

Consider a profit-maximizing firm in a perfectly competitive market with several sellers and several buyers (i.e., the firm is a "price taker" of the goods it sells and a "price taker" of the hourly wages it pays its workers). If a technological innovation made by someone in this firm were to significantly raise the firm's marginal physical product (but not that of any other firm's), then this innovation would

Options:

A: lead the firm to reduce workers' wages as they now contribute less marginal revenue
B: lead the firm to hire more workers but not to raise their wages
C: reduce the firm's employment level but raise workers' wages
D: lead the firm to hire more workers and to pay them higher wages
E: raise the workers’ hourly wage as they now contribute more marginal revenue
F: reduce the firm's employment level and lower workers' wages
G: cause the firm to hire fewer workers but pay them higher wages
H: lead the firm to hire the same number of workers but pay them higher wages
I: reduce the firm’s employment level, because fewer workers are now needed
J: have no effect on the firm's employment level or workers' wages

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question here. Let me take it step by step. The question is about a profit-maximizing firm in a perfectly competitive market. I remember that in perfect competition, firms are price takers, meaning they can't influence the market price of their goods or the wages they pay. They have to accept whatever the market sets.

The scenario is that a technological innovation in this particular firm significantly raises its marginal physical product (MPP). But importantly, this doesn't affect any other firms. So the question is, what happens as a result of this innovation?

Let me recall what MPP is. Marginal physical product is the additional output a firm gets from hiring one more worker, assuming other inputs are held constant. So if this firm's MPP increases, each additional worker is contributing more to production than before.

In a perfectly competitive labor market, the wage is determined by the marginal revenue product (MRP), which is the marginal physical product multiplied by the price of the output. Since the firm is a price taker, the price (P) is constant. So MRP = MPP * P.

Wait, but in this case, the firm's MPP increases due to the innovation. So the MRP would also increase because MRP is directly proportional to MPP. So each worker, especially additional workers beyond the current level, would bring in more revenue than before.

Profit-maximizing firms hire workers until the MRP equals the wage rate (W). So initially, they were hiring where MRP = W. Now, with MRP increased, the firm's MRP curve has shifted upwards.

So let me think about how this affects the quantity of labor. Before the innovation, the firm was at equilibrium where MRP = W. After the innovation, for each existing worker, their MRP is higher. But wait, the market wage is set by the industry, right? Because the firm is a price taker in both goods and labor markets. So the wage rate W doesn't change because it's determined by the market, not by this single firm.

Wait, no, that's conflicting. If the firm is a price taker in the labor market, then the wage is given, so W is fixed from the firm's perspective. So when MPP increases, MRP increases as well because MRP=MPP*P, and P is constant. So the firm's MRP for each worker is higher. But since the firm is maximizing profits, it will hire workers as long as MRP >= W.

Hmm, so before, they hired up to point A where MRP (old) = W. Now, with MRP higher, the MRP curve shifts up. So for the existing number of workers, their MRP is now higher than W. But the firm will want to hire more workers until the MRP of the last worker equals W again. Because beyond that point, MRP would drop below W, and hiring more wouldn't be profitable.

Wait, but in perfect competition, the firm can't influence the wage, so W is fixed. So if the MRP increases, the firm will hire more workers until the new MRP (which is now higher) intersects W again. So that means the firm will increase its demand for labor.

So the firm's labor demand increases. But wait, in a competitive labor market, the supply of labor is such that individual firms can't affect the wage. So if the firm increases its demand, but all other firms are unaffected (since the innovation only affects this one firm), the market wage doesn't change. So this firm will hire more workers because each additional worker is now more productive, thus increasing MRP beyond W, so they'll hire until MRP equals W again.

Wait, but wait, if the MRP is higher now, the point where MRP = W is further along the labor quantity axis. So the firm will hire more workers. So the number of workers increases.

But what about the wages? Since the firm is a price taker in the labor market, the wage rate is determined by the market. Since only this one firm has the innovation, the market supply and demand for labor haven't changed. So the wage rate remains the same. Therefore, the firm will hire more workers at the same wage rate.

So looking at the options, I need to find the one where the firm hires more workers but doesn't raise their wages.

Looking at the options:

Option B: lead the firm to hire more workers but not to raise their wages.

Option D: hire more and pay higher wages.

Wait, but why would the firm pay higher wages? Since it's a price taker, it can't set the wage. So the wage remains the same. So option B seems correct.

Wait another thought: does the innovation affect the firm's demand for labor, leading it to hire more? Yes. And since the wage is determined by the market, it doesn't change. So the firm hires more workers at the same wage.

So the answer should be B: hire more workers but not raise their wages.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The MRP increases because MPP increases, so the firm's demand for labor increases. Since the market wage is unchanged, the firm will hire more. So the correct choice is B.

In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers, meaning they cannot influence the market price of goods or wages. The question involves a firm where a technological innovation increases its marginal physical product (MPP), which in turn increases its marginal revenue product (MRP) since MRP = MPP * price, and the price is constant. 

In a profit-maximizing framework, firms hire workers until MRP equals the wage rate (W). Initially, the firm hires where MRP = W. After the innovation, the MRP increases, shifting the MRP curve upward. Since the firm is a price taker in the labor market, the wage rate remains unchanged. Therefore, the firm will hire more workers until the new MRP equals the unchanged wage rate.

The innovation increases the firm's demand for labor, leading to higher employment. However, since the wage rate is determined by the market and unaffected by this single firm's innovation, wages do not rise. Thus, the firm hires more workers but does not raise their wages.

The correct answer is:

**B: lead the firm to hire more workers but not to raise their wages.**
