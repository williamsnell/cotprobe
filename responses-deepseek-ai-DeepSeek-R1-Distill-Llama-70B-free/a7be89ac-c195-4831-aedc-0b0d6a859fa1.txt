Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a woman with urticaria, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's start by breaking down the question.

The patient is a 22-year-old woman who comes in because of urticaria. It's her first episode, and it's happened a few times in the past week, but each time it resolved on its own. The history and physical exam don't show any abnormalities. So what should the doctor do?

The options are A through D. Let's go through each one.

Option A: Determine the serum IgE concentration. I remember that IgE is involved in allergic reactions. High levels can indicate allergies or parasitic infections. But is this the first step? I'm not sure. Urticaria can be caused by a lot of things, including allergies, infections, autoimmune issues, or even idiopathic reasons. But checking IgE might not immediately help unless there's a suspicion of a specific allergy or other condition.

Option B: Determine the total eosinophil count. Eosinophils are another marker for allergic reactions or parasitic infections. Elevated counts can suggest an allergic cause. But again, like IgE, this might be more for specific cases rather than initial management. Plus, without knowing the cause, this test might not add much.

Option C: Refer her to an allergist. If the urticaria is severe, persistent, or the cause is unclear, sometimes a referral is made. But this is her first episode, and it's been resolving on its own. Referral might be premature unless there's a suspicion of a complicated allergy or other underlying issue.

Option D: Treat the symptoms. Urticaria is often managed with antihistamines or corticosteroids to alleviate the symptoms like itching and hives. Since this is a first-time episode and she's otherwise healthy, treating the symptoms might be the most appropriate first step. Further testing could be considered if the symptoms don't improve or if they recur frequently.

Wait, but what about the cause? Shouldn't they try to find the cause first? Well, in acute urticaria (which this seems to be, given it's the first episode and it's resolving), the approach is usually to manage symptoms while possibly looking for triggers. But if the history and physical don't show any abnormalities, they might not have any leads on the cause. So treating the symptoms makes sense, and if it keeps happening, then further investigation would be needed.

So the most appropriate action here is probably to treat the symptoms. That would be option D.

The patient is a 22-year-old woman presenting with her first episode of urticaria, which has resolved and recurred several times over the past week. The history and physical examination reveal no abnormalities, suggesting an uncomplicated case. 

- **Option A** (serum IgE concentration) and **Option B** (eosinophil count) are more relevant for identifying specific causes like allergies or parasitic infections but are not necessary as initial steps in this case. 
- **Option C** (referral to an allergist) might be premature without evidence of a complex or persistent condition. 
- **Option D** (treat the symptoms) is the most appropriate initial approach, as it addresses the patient's discomfort and aligns with the management of acute urticaria.

Given the acute nature of the condition and the lack of findings on history and physical exam, treating the symptoms is the best course of action. Further investigation or referral can be considered if symptoms persist or worsen.

Answer: D
