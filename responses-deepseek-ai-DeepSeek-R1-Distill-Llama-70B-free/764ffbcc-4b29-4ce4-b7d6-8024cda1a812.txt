Okay, so I've got this question about employment testing and performance. Hmm, let me think through it. The question says that female applicants consistently get lower scores on a selection test than males. But when they're hired, they perform just as well as the males on the job. What does this situation illustrate?

I remember from my studies that there are different concepts related to discrimination and testing in the workplace. Let me try to recall the terms.

The first option is reverse discrimination, which I think is when policies meant to help minorities might unfairly disadvantage the majority group. But I'm not sure if that's what's happening here. The question is more about test scores versus job performance, not about policies favoring certain groups.

Disparate treatment refers to when people are treated differently because of their race, gender, etc. But here, the issue isn't about intentional different treatment; it's about test results not matching job performance. So maybe not B.

Differential selection—does that mean different selection methods? Or maybe it's about how different groups are selected based on tests. I'm not too clear on that term. I'll have to think more about it.

Differential validity is a term I'm vaguely remembering. I think it refers to when a test predicts job performance differently for different groups. Like, the test might be valid for one group but not another. So if women score lower but perform as well, maybe the test isn't valid for them. That could be it.

Adverse impact is when a seemingly neutral employment practice (like a test) disproportionately affects a protected group. Even if it's not intentional, it's illegal if it has a worse impact on that group. So if women are getting lower scores, leading to fewer being hired, that could be adverse impact. But the question also says they perform as well, so the test might not be a valid measure for them.

Unfairness is a broader term. It's more general, so the question is probably pointing to a specific legal or testing concept.

Glass ceiling effect is about women being blocked from advancing to higher-level positions, which doesn't fit here because the question is about hiring and job performance, not promotions.

Gender bias in testing would mean the test is unfair to one gender. That's similar to differential validity or adverse impact, but I'm not sure which term is correct here.

Sexual harassment is unrelated here. Constructive dismissal is about employees feeling forced to resign, which doesn't fit.

So, the key here is that the test results are lower for women, but their job performance is equal. This suggests that the test might not be a valid predictor for women. If the test has differential validity, it would mean it's more predictive for one group than another. Alternatively, if the test is causing adverse impact, it's disproportionately screening out women even though they can perform the job.

Wait, differential validity is when the test's validity differs across groups. So if the test is less valid for women, that's differential validity. But the question doesn't say the test isn't valid for women; it just says that despite lower scores, their job performance is the same as men. So maybe the test is less valid for women, indicating differential validity. But another possibility is that the test has adverse impact because it's keeping out qualified women.

So which concept does this situation illustrate? The scenario seems to show that the test isn't a good predictor for women because they end up performing as well as men. So the test's validity differs by gender, which would be differential validity. But wait, another angle: if the test is causing a group to be excluded (lower scores) but they can perform the job, this is adverse impact. Because the test is having a disparate effect on women, even if it's not intentional.

I'm a bit confused between D and E. Adverse impact is about the effect, not necessarily the validity. So the test might have adverse impact if more women are failing but when hired, they perform fine. It could mean the test isn't valid for women, leading to an adverse impact.

Alternatively, if the test is valid for men but not women, that's differential validity. But the question doesn't state whether the test is actually a good predictor for job performance for each group. It only says that women score lower but perform as well.

So perhaps the test has differential validity because it's not accurately predicting job performance for women. That would mean the test is valid for men but not for women. So when women are hired despite lower scores, they perform as well, implying the test isn't a good measure for their abilities.

Alternatively, if the test is less predictive for women, it's having an adverse impact because it's screening them out unnecessarily.

Wait, another thought. If the test has lower scores for women, but when hired, they perform as well, that suggests that the test isn't a valid measure for them. So the validity differs, making it differential validity (D). But another possibility is that the test is having an adverse impact because it disproportionately affects women, even though they can do the job.

Hmm, so how do I choose between D (differential validity) and E (adverse impact)?

I think differential validity is more about whether the test's prediction of performance is the same across groups. If the test is valid for men but not women, then differential validity applies.

Adverse impact is about the effect of the test on hiring rates, regardless of validity. So if the test causes women to be underrepresented, even if they can do the job, that's adverse impact.

In this scenario, the test is causing women to score lower, which could lead to fewer being hired (adverse impact). But when they are hired, they perform as well. So the test is having an adverse impact because it's keeping out qualified women. But the test's validity for women is questionable because their lower scores don't translate to lower job performance.

Wait, but the question is what the situation illustrates. The fact that the test results in lower scores for women, but they perform as well when hired—this means that the selection process is disproportionately affecting women, which is adverse impact. Because even though they can do the job, they're being screened out based on the test.

So the correct answer would be E: adverse impact. Because the test is having a disparate effect on women, leading to lower scores, even though they can perform the job. Therefore, it's an example of adverse impact.

Alternatively, if the test's validity differed, that would be differential validity. But the question is showing that the test isn't a good measure for women's job performance, leading to adverse impact.

Wait, but the test could have differential validity because it's not predicting job performance equally for both genders. So if the test is valid for men but not women, that's differential validity. But if the test is causing adverse impact, that's a different concept.

But the question is about the situation illustrating which of the following. The situation shows that the test is resulting in lower scores for women, but their job performance is the same. That points towards the test being a less valid predictor for women, which is differential validity. However, another angle is that the test is causing an adverse impact because it's excluding women who could perform.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. I think I need to recall the definitions more clearly.

Adverse impact is when a neutral employment practice has a disproportionately negative effect on a protected group. It doesn't have to be intentional, and it can occur even if the practice is valid. But if the test is not valid for the group, then it's not a valid predictor, and hence, using it would be adverse impact.

Wait, but in this case, the test is less valid for women because their lower scores don't match their job performance. So the validity is different, meaning differential validity. Therefore, the situation would illustrate differential validity.

Alternatively, if the test is valid for men but not for women, and thus women are being excluded more, that could lead to adverse impact. But the question is about what the situation illustrates, not the effect. So the fact that validity differs would be the key point.

Wait, perhaps the situation shows that the test is having an adverse impact because it's screening out women even though they can perform. So it's an example of adverse impact, regardless of the validity.

I'm a bit torn. But I think the answer is E: adverse impact. Because the test is causing a disparate effect on women. The lower scores lead to fewer women being selected, which is an adverse impact. The fact that they perform as well when hired suggests that the test isn't a good measure, but the main issue is the adverse impact.

Wait, another thought. The Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures mention that if a test has an adverse impact, the employer must show that the test is job-related and consistent with business necessity. So if the test doesn't predict performance for women, it might not be valid, leading to adverse impact.

But the scenario doesn't specify whether the test is job-related. It just says women score lower but perform as well. So the situation shows that the test is having an adverse impact on women because they're scoring lower, which could lead to fewer being hired, even though they can perform. So the correct answer is E: adverse impact.

The question describes a scenario where female applicants consistently score lower on a selection test than male applicants, yet when hired, they perform as well as males on the job. This situation raises concerns about the fairness and validity of the selection process. 

To analyze the options:

- **Reverse discrimination (A):** This refers to policies or practices that unfairly disadvantage a majority group, which is not relevant here since the issue is about test scores and job performance, not policies favoring certain groups.
- **Disparate treatment (B):** This involves intentional discrimination, but the scenario does not indicate intentional bias, only differences in test scores and job performance.
- **Differential selection (C):** This could refer to differences in selection methods, but the question focuses on test validity and job performance, not selection methods.
- **Differential validity (D):** This refers to a test's validity differing across groups. If the test predicts job performance for men but not for women, it could apply. However, the scenario emphasizes the disproportionate impact of the test on women, which points more to adverse impact.
- **Adverse impact (E):** This occurs when a neutral employment practice disproportionately affects a protected group. The test causing lower scores for women, despite their equal job performance, illustrates adverse impact because it may unfairly exclude qualified women.
- **Unfairness (F):** While the situation is unfair, this term is too broad and does not specifically address the legal or testing concept at play.
- **Glass ceiling effect (G):** This refers to barriers preventing women from advancing to higher positions, which is unrelated to the hiring and job performance described.
- **Gender bias (H):** While the test may be biased, the scenario specifically highlights the disproportionate effect on women, which aligns more with adverse impact.
- **Sexual harassment (I) and Constructive dismissal (J):** These are unrelated to the scenario.

The key issue is that the test disproportionately affects women (lower scores) even though they perform as well as men when hired. This illustrates **adverse impact**, as the test is having a disparate effect on a protected group. While differential validity could also apply if the test's validity differs by gender, the scenario emphasizes the test's disproportionate impact, making adverse impact the most appropriate answer.
