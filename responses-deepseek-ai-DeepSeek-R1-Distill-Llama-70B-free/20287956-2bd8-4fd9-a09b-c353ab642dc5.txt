Okay, so I have this physics question about sound waves. The question is asking about the direction in which compressions and rarefactions in sound normally travel. Hmm, I remember from my classes that sound is a type of wave, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Wait, sound waves are mechanical waves, right? So they require a medium to travel through, like air, water, or solids. Now, when a sound wave moves through a medium, it creates regions of compression and rarefaction. Compressions are areas where the molecules are packed closely together, and rarefactions are where they're spread out.

I think the wave itself moves in a certain direction. But what about the compressions and rarefactions themselves? Do they move in the same direction as the wave, or differently? I recall that in a wave, the particles of the medium oscillate back and forth, but the wave propagates in a specific direction.

So if the wave is moving, say, to the right, the compressions and rarefactions must also be moving to the right. Because each compression is causing the next one as the wave moves along. So the compressions and rarefactions don't move in opposite directions or zig-zag; they're part of the wave moving in the same direction.

Wait, but wait. When a wave is moving forward, each individual particle moves up and down (in transverse waves) or back and forth (longitudinal), but the particles themselves don't move along with the wave's direction. But in the case of sound, which is a longitudinal wave, the particles move back and forth along the same direction as the wave's propagation.

So the compressions and rarefactions themselves are parts of the wave that are moving in the same direction as the wave's travel. So the answer would be that they travel in the same direction.

Looking at the options, option C says "in the same direction." So I think that's the correct choice.

The compressions and rarefactions in sound waves are regions where the medium's particles are either densely packed or spread out. Sound is a longitudinal wave, meaning the particles oscillate back and forth along the direction of the wave's propagation. As the wave moves forward, the compressions and rarefactions also move in the same direction as the wave. Therefore, the correct answer is that they travel in the same direction.

Answer: C
