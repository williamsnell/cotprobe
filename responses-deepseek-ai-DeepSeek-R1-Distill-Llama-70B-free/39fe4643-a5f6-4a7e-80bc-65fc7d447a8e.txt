Okay, so I have this question about whether the polynomial x² - 12 satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q. Hmm, I remember that the Eisenstein criterion is a way to determine if a polynomial is irreducible over the rationals. Let me think through this step by step.

First, what's the Eisenstein criterion again? From what I recall, a polynomial f(x) in Z[x] (so with integer coefficients) satisfies Eisenstein's criterion with respect to a prime number p if:

1. All coefficients except the leading one are divisible by p.
2. The leading coefficient is not divisible by p².
3. The constant term is not divisible by p².

If these conditions are met, then the polynomial is irreducible over Q, meaning it can't be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients.

So the polynomial in question is x² - 12. Let's write it as x² + 0x -12 to see the coefficients more clearly. The coefficients are 1 (for x²), 0 (for x), and -12 (constant term).

Now, I need to check if there exists a prime p such that Eisenstein's conditions are satisfied.

Let's go through possible primes one by one.

Starting with p=2:
- Leading coefficient is 1, which is not divisible by 2. So condition 2 might be satisfied. Wait, no, condition 2 says the leading coefficient shouldn't be divisible by p squared, which is 4 in this case. Since 1 isn't divisible by 4, condition 2 holds.
- Next, check if all other coefficients are divisible by p. Here, the middle coefficient is 0, which is divisible by 2. The constant term is -12, which is divisible by 2. So condition 1 is satisfied.
- Now condition 3: the constant term must not be divisible by p squared (which is 4 here). Let's see: -12 divided by 4 is -3. So 4 doesn't divide -12? Wait, no, wait. 4 divides 12 because 12 is 3*4. So -12 is indeed divisible by 4. That means condition 3 is not satisfied because the constant term is divisible by p². So p=2 doesn't work.

Hmm, so p=2 isn't suitable because the constant term is divisible by 4.

How about p=3?
- Leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3 or 9, so condition 2 is satisfied.
- Check condition 1: The middle term is 0, which is divisible by 3. The constant term is -12, which is also divisible by 3? Yes, because 12 is 3*4. So condition 1 is met.
- Now condition 3: Is -12 divisible by 3 squared, which is 9? Let's see: 12 divided by 9 is 1.333... So 9 doesn't divide 12. Therefore, the constant term isn't divisible by p². So all conditions are satisfied for p=3.

Wait, so if p=3 works, then the polynomial satisfies the Eisenstein criterion, right? So the answer would be yes, with p=3.

But wait, another thought: the polynomial is x² -12. If it's irreducible over Q, then it can't be factored into rational factors. Alternatively, if it is reducible, then it would factor into (x - a)(x + b) where a*b=12 and a + b=0. Wait, but that would require a and b to be additive inverses and multiplicative factors of 12. But let me think, maybe 12 can be expressed as a product of two integers that add up to zero. For example, 3 and -3 would multiply to -9, not 12. Alternatively, 4 and -4 would give -16. Hmm, maybe it's not possible, but I'm not sure. But wait, if Eisenstein applies, then it's definitely irreducible, so I don't have to worry about the actual factors.

Wait, but I thought that Eisenstein is a sufficient condition, not a necessary one. So the fact that it meets the Eisenstein with p=3 would mean it's irreducible, so option G would be correct.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option G says yes with p=3. Option B says no because it's reducible, which would be incorrect if Eisenstein applies. Option D says no because the criteria aren't met, which would be wrong if p=3 works. So the correct answer would be G.

Wait another thing: looking back, when p=3, the constant term is -12, which is 3 * (-4). So p divides the constant term, and p²=9 doesn't divide it because 9 doesn't divide 12. So condition 3 is met. So yes, p=3 works. So the answer should be G: Yes, with p=3.

Wait but let me check other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Let's try p=2 again. We saw that condition 3 fails because 4 divides 12. So p=2 can't be used. p=5: the constant term is -12, which isn't divisible by 5, so condition 1 fails because the middle term is 0 (which is divisible by 5), but the constant term isn't. So p=5 won't work. p=4 isn't a prime, so it's not considered. p=1 isn't a prime either. So the only option that works is p=3.

Therefore, the correct answer is option G: Yes, with p=3.

To determine whether the polynomial \( x^2 - 12 \) satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over \( \mathbb{Q} \), we analyze the conditions for Eisenstein's criterion:

1. All coefficients except the leading one must be divisible by a prime \( p \).
2. The leading coefficient must not be divisible by \( p^2 \).
3. The constant term must not be divisible by \( p^2 \).

The polynomial \( x^2 - 12 \) has coefficients \( 1 \) (for \( x^2 \)), \( 0 \) (for \( x \)), and \( -12 \) (constant term). We test possible primes:

- **For \( p = 2 \):**
  - The leading coefficient \( 1 \) is not divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \), so condition 2 is satisfied.
  - The middle coefficient \( 0 \) is divisible by \( 2 \), and the constant term \( -12 \) is divisible by \( 2 \), so condition 1 is satisfied.
  - However, the constant term \( -12 \) is divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \), so condition 3 fails. Thus, \( p = 2 \) does not work.

- **For \( p = 3 \):**
  - The leading coefficient \( 1 \) is not divisible by \( 3^2 = 9 \), so condition 2 is satisfied.
  - The middle coefficient \( 0 \) is divisible by \( 3 \), and the constant term \( -12 \) is divisible by \( 3 \), so condition 1 is satisfied.
  - The constant term \( -12 \) is not divisible by \( 3^2 = 9 \), so condition 3 is satisfied. Thus, \( p = 3 \) works.

- **For \( p = 5 \):**
  - The constant term \( -12 \) is not divisible by \( 5 \), so condition 1 fails. Thus, \( p = 5 \) does not work.

Since \( p = 3 \) satisfies all conditions of the Eisenstein criterion, the polynomial \( x^2 - 12 \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**G: Yes, with \( p = 3 \).**
