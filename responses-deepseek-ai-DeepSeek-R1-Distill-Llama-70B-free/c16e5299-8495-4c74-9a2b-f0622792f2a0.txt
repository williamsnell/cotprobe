Question:

Two weeks before an election, a local newspaper published an article implying that one of the mayoral candidates was a thief. The candidate subsequently lost the election and sued the newspaper for defamation. The newspaper defended on the grounds of truth. At trial, the candidate took the stand and testified that he was not a thief. Thereafter, the newspaper called a witness to testify that three years ago the candidate committed a larceny while employed at his former job. Upon objection by the candidate's attorney, the witness's testimony should be

Options:

A: excluded, as it can potentially bias the jury.
B: excluded, because it is hearsay evidence.
C: admitted, as it supports the newspaper's defense of truth.
D: excluded, because it is improper character evidence.
E: admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief.
F: excluded, because the act was committed too long ago to be relevant.
G: admitted as probative evidence of the candidate's character for veracity.
H: admitted, as it is relevant to the candidate's credibility.
I: admitted, but only if the witness can provide conclusive proof of the larceny.
J: excluded, because bad acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.

Okay, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically defamation and what evidence is admissible. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is a defamation case. A newspaper published an article implying a mayoral candidate was a thief, and the candidate lost the election and sued. The newspaper's defense is truth, so they need to prove that the statement was true—that the candidate was indeed a thief.

At trial, the candidate testified that he wasn't a thief. Then the newspaper called a witness who would testify that three years ago, the candidate committed larceny at his former job. The candidate's attorney objected, so the question is whether this testimony should be admitted or excluded.

Hmm, I remember that in defamation cases, when the defendant claims the statement was true, they can introduce evidence to support that. But there are rules about character evidence and prior bad acts.

So, under the Federal Rules of Evidence, character evidence is generally not admissible except in specific situations. For example, in a criminal case, the prosecution can't usually bring up a defendant's prior crimes unless they relate to the current charge. But in a civil case like this, I think the rules might be a bit different.

Wait, defamation is a civil case. The newspaper is trying to prove the truth, so they might try to introduce specific instances of conduct to show that the candidate had a tendency to commit theft. But I think there's a rule against using extrinsic evidence of specific instances to prove conduct on a particular occasion, except for certain exceptions like when it's about the plaintiff's character.

Oh right, FRE 405. It says that methods of proving character: when character evidence is admissible, it can be done by testimony about reputation or opinion, but not by specific instances unless they are of a party's character. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, FRE 405(b) says that in cases where a person's character trait is an essential element of a claim or defense, proof may be made by specific instances. But in this case, the newspaper's defense is that the candidate is a thief, so maybe that makes it an essential element. Or is it just a defense of truth, where they have to prove the statement was true, but not necessarily that the candidate has a general character of being a thief?

Alternatively, FRE 608(b) deals with specific instances of conduct to attack a witness's character for truthfulness. But that's more about impeachment of a witness, not about proving the case.

Wait, the candidate took the stand and testified he wasn't a thief. So the newspaper is trying to rebut that. But when a witness testifies, the opposing party can attack their credibility, which includes showing that they have a character for untruthfulness. But that doesn't directly relate to the prior theft—it relates to lying.

Wait, but the newspaper is trying to prove that the candidate is a thief, so they're probably offering the prior larceny as evidence that he's a thief, which would support the truth of the statement.

But under FRE 404(b), evidence of other crimes or bad acts is admissible for certain purposes, like to show motive, opportunity, intent, etc., but not to show that the person is of a certain character and acted in accordance with it.

Wait, but in a civil case, the standard might be a bit more lenient. However, I think that generally, prior bad acts aren't admissible to prove propensity to commit crimes unless it's for a specific purpose like those listed in 404(b).

But wait, in this case, the newspaper is trying to prove the truth of the statement, which is that the candidate is a thief. So the prior larceny would be direct evidence of that. But wait, how is that being offered? If it's offered to show that he did commit a theft, which would make the statement true, then it's not about his character but about whether the statement was truthful.

But wait, in this scenario, the newspaper is calling a witness to testify about a specific instance of theft. The candidate's attorney objects. So is this permissible?

I think the key here is whether the prior act is being offered to prove that the candidate is a thief (i.e., character) or to prove that he actually committed a theft, making the statement true.

If the newspaper is offering this as evidence that the candidate was a thief, thereby making the statement true, then it's not about character but about the truth of the statement. But wait, in that case, it's extrinsic evidence of a specific instance, and I think that's allowed when the matter is about the truth of the statement.

Wait, but the candidate testified that he wasn't a thief, so the newspaper is trying to rebut that. So the prior act is being used to show that he's lying now, or that he did commit a theft, making the statement true.

But I'm a bit confused about the rules here. Let me think again.

FRE 405(a) says that in cases where evidence of a person's character is admissible, it can be proved by testimony about reputation or opinion, but specific instances are not allowed except when provided by FRE 405(b), which allows specific instances when character is an essential element of the case.

Wait, in this case, is the candidate's character as a thief an essential element of the newspaper's defense? The defense is truth, so they need to prove that the candidate is a thief. So perhaps under 405(b), they can use specific instances.

Alternatively, maybe the newspaper is offering the prior act not to show his character but to show that he actually committed a theft, making the statement true. But in that case, is that allowed? Because the prior act is being used to prove the truth of the statement, not his character.

Wait, but the prior act is a specific instance of conduct, which would fall under 405(a) as character evidence. Unless it's allowed under 405(b) because character is an essential element.

So, the candidate's status as a thief is central to the defense. Thus, under 405(b), the newspaper can introduce specific instances of conduct, like the prior larceny, to prove that he is a thief.

But wait, another angle: FRE 609 deals with impeachment by evidence of conviction of a crime. But the prior larceny is three years ago, and I don't know if it's a conviction. The question doesn't specify that the candidate was convicted, just that he committed larceny. So 609 might not apply here.

Alternatively, the prior act might be admissible under 404(b) to show that the candidate had the opportunity or tendency to commit theft, but 404(b) requires that the evidence be offered for a purpose other than showing propensity, like intent or plan.

Wait, but in this case, the purpose is to show that the candidate is a thief, which is exactly propensity. So 404(b) would exclude it because it's being used to show that he's a thief and therefore committed the act again, which is propensity.

Wait, but in a civil case, the standard for admissibility under 404(b) is a bit more relaxed, but I'm not sure. I think the default is that prior bad acts are not admissible to show propensity unless an exception applies.

Wait, but if the defense is that the statement was true, then the prior act is being used to prove that the statement was true, which is a non-propensity purpose. So maybe it's admissible under 404(b) as it's relevant to show the truth of the statement.

But I'm getting confused. Let's try to outline the possible options.

Option C: admitted as it supports the newspaper's defense of truth. That would mean it's relevant and admissible.

Option D: excluded as improper character evidence. But if 405(b) applies, it's allowed.

Option E: admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief. But if 405(a) allows only reputation or opinion unless 405(b) applies.

Option J: excluded because bad acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. But J says "bad acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence." Wait, does that mean that you can't bring in extrinsic evidence of specific instances? But 405(b) allows specific instances when character is an essential element.

So, in this case, the candidate's being a thief is essential to the defense. So under 405(b), the newspaper can bring in specific instances, such as the prior larceny, through testimony.

But wait, the prior larceny is an extrinsic specific instance. So the witness is testifying about a specific act. So under 405(b), that's allowed.

So the testimony should be admitted.

Wait, but wait another point. The candidate testified that he wasn't a thief. The newspaper is trying to rebut that. So they can offer evidence to show that he was a thief. That evidence is a specific instance of conduct, which would be allowed under 405(b) because the candidate's character as a thief is an essential element of the defense.

So the answer would be C: admitted, as it supports the newspaper's defense of truth.

But wait, another thought. The candidate's character is a thief is an essential element because the defense is that the statement was true. So 405(b) applies, allowing specific instances.

Alternatively, some might argue that the prior act is too remote. The question says it was three years ago. But the admissibility doesn't depend on time unless it's so remote that it's irrelevant. Three years isn't that long in some cases, so it might still be relevant.

Alternatively, option F says it's excluded because the act was committed too long ago. But I don't think three years is automatically too long; it depends on the context.

So, the correct answer is C.

Wait, but wait. Another angle: when a witness (the candidate) testifies, the opposing party can attack their credibility. The newspaper could try to impeach the candidate's credibility by showing he's a thief, which would relate to his character for truthfulness.

But wait, under FRE 608(b), specific instances of conduct that relate to truthfulness can be used to attack a witness's credibility. So if the prior larceny is being offered to show that the candidate is a liar, then it's not directly relevant. Unless the act of theft somehow relates to his truthfulness.

But if the newspaper is trying to show that the candidate is a thief to prove that the statement was true, then it's not about credibility but about the truth of the statement. So it's about character as a thief, not as a liar.

So, in that case, the evidence is being offered to prove that the candidate is a thief, making the newspaper's statement true. So it's about the truth of the statement, not about the candidate's credibility as a witness.

So, under 405(b), since the candidate's status as a thief is an essential element of the defense, they can introduce specific instances. Therefore, the testimony should be admitted.

So the correct answer would be C.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option C: admitted, as it supports the newspaper's defense of truth.

Option E: admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief.

Option H: admitted as relevant to the candidate's credibility.

Wait, but if it's about credibility, then under 608(b), specific instances can't be proved by extrinsic evidence. So if the newspaper is trying to impeach the candidate's credibility by showing he's a thief, they can't use extrinsic evidence (like another witness) for that purpose. They can only ask the candidate about it on cross-examination.

In this scenario, the newspaper is calling a witness to testify about the prior act, which is extrinsic evidence. So if their purpose is to impeach credibility, that's not allowed. But if their purpose is to prove that the candidate is a thief (to support their defense of truth), then it's allowed under 405(b).

So, the correct reasoning is that the evidence is being used to prove the truth of the statement, which makes it admissible. Therefore, the answer is C.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option J says excluded because bad acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. But that's not accurate because extrinsic evidence is allowed under certain circumstances, like when it's about a central issue.

I think the correct answer is C: admitted, as it supports the newspaper's defense of truth.

Wait, no, wait another point. The newspaper is the defendant, and they're asserting the defense of truth. So the burden is on them to prove that the statement was true. To do that, they need to show that the candidate is a thief. So they can present evidence of specific acts, as the candidate's status as a thief is an essential element of their defense.

Thus, under FRE 405(b), they can use specific instances. So the testimony should be admitted, making option C correct.

But wait, another thought: when a party's character is at issue, specific instances are allowed. So if the candidate's character is central to the case, the specific acts can come in.

So, yes, the answer should be C.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence in a defamation case where the defendant newspaper claims the statement was true, and the plaintiff candidate denies being a thief. The newspaper seeks to introduce testimony about a specific instance of larceny committed by the candidate three years prior. The analysis focuses on the Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly FRE 404, 405, and 608.

Under FRE 405(b), when a person's character trait is an essential element of a claim or defense, specific instances of conduct may be used to prove that trait. Here, the newspaper's defense of truth hinges on proving the candidate is a thief, making the candidate's character as a thief central to the case. Thus, the prior larceny can be introduced as a specific instance of conduct under FRE 405(b).

While FRE 404(b) generally prohibits using prior bad acts to show propensity, the evidence here is not being offered to demonstrate propensity but to directly prove the truth of the statement. Therefore, it is admissible for this purpose. Additionally, the time frame of three years is not so remote as to render the evidence irrelevant.

The testimony is not being used to impeach the candidate's credibility under FRE 608(b), as it is not about truthfulness but rather about proving the candidate's status as a thief. Since the evidence supports the newspaper's defense of truth and is admissible under FRE 405(b), the correct answer is:

C: admitted, as it supports the newspaper's defense of truth.

Answer: C
