Okay, so I've got this question here about E. coli cells and their proteins. Let's see what it's asking. Hmm, the question states that an E. coli cell has 10^6 protein molecules, each with a molecular weight of 40,000. And I need to calculate the total length of all the polypeptide chains in a single cell, assuming they're all alpha-helical. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Alright, where to start. I remember that the molecular weight of a protein is related to the number of amino acids it has. Each amino acid contributes a certain amount to the molecular weight. I think the average molecular weight per amino acid is around 120-130 g/mol, but wait, more specifically, I've heard that it's approximately 120 g/mol. Or was it 110? Hmm, maybe I should double-check that. Oh well, for this problem, let's go with 120 g/mol per amino acid as a standard value used in such calculations.

So each protein has a molecular weight of 40,000 g/mol. Let me figure out how many amino acids that corresponds to. Molecular weight divided by per amino acid weight. So 40,000 / 120 = approximately 333.33 amino acids per protein. Wait, does that make sense? Yeah, because each amino acid is about 120, so 333 of them would add up to 40,000. So each protein is about 333 amino acids long.

Now, the next part is about the structure of the alpha-helix. I recall that in an alpha-helix, each amino acid corresponds to a certain rise along the helix. I think the alpha-helix has a pitch of about 5.4 angstroms per turn, but wait, that's the height per full turn. Each full turn has about 3.6 amino acids, right? So per amino acid, how much does the helix rise?

Let me calculate that. If one turn is 5.4 angstroms and has 3.6 amino acids, then per amino acid, the rise is 5.4 / 3.6. Let's see, 5.4 divided by 3.6 equals... 1.5 angstroms per amino acid. So each amino acid adds 1.5 angstroms to the length of the polypeptide chain.

So each protein has 333 amino acids, each contributing 1.5 angstroms. So the length of one protein is 333 * 1.5. Let me compute that. 333 times 1 is 333, 333 times 0.5 is 166.5. So adding them together, 333 + 166.5 = 499.5 angstroms. Let me round that to approximately 500 angstroms per protein. Wait, wait, that seems a bit long. Does that make sense? Hmm, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, no, another approach. I remember that the alpha helix rise per amino acid is about 1.5 angstroms. So for each protein of 333 amino acids, the total length would be 333 * 1.5 = 499.5 angstroms, which is roughly 500 angstroms. So that's about 0.05 micrometers per protein. That seems plausible.

Now, the cell has 1e6 (10^6) such proteins. So the total length for all proteins is 1e6 multiplied by 500 angstroms. Let me calculate that. 1e6 * 500 = 5e8 angstroms. Wait, 5 times 10^8 angstroms.

But wait, units are important here. I need to convert this to centimeters. Let me remember the conversions. I know that 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, which is 1e-8 centimeters. So each angstrom is 1e-8 cm.

So, 5e8 angstroms * 1e-8 cm/angstrom = 5 cm. Because 5e8 * 1e-8 = 5 * (1e8 * 1e-8) )= 5 * 1 =5 cm. So the total length is 5 centimeters.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.0 cm. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So:

Molecular weight per protein: 40,000 g/mol. Each amino acid is 120 g/mol. So 40000 /120 = 333.33. So that's correct.

Each amino acid in alpha helix contributes 1.5 angstroms. So 333 * 1.5 = 499.5 angstroms, approx 500. Correct.

Number of proteins: 1e6. So total length is 1e6 * 500 angstroms = 5e8 angstroms. Convert to cm: 5e8 * 1e-8 cm =5 cm. So yes, option C is correct.

To calculate the total length of all the polypeptide chains in a single E. coli cell, we proceed as follows:

1. **Determine the number of amino acids per protein**:  
   Each protein has a molecular weight of 40,000 g/mol, and the average molecular weight of an amino acid is approximately 120 g/mol.  
   \[
   \text{Number of amino acids per protein} = \frac{40,000}{120} \approx 333.33 \, \text{amino acids}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the length of one protein**:  
   In an alpha-helix, each amino acid contributes 1.5 angstroms (Å) to the length of the polypeptide chain.  
   \[
   \text{Length of one protein} = 333.33 \times 1.5 \, \text{Å} \approx 500 \, \text{Å}.
   \]

3. **Calculate the total length for all proteins**:  
   The cell contains \(10^6\) protein molecules.  
   \[
   \text{Total length} = 10^6 \times 500 \, \text{Å} = 5 \times 10^8 \, \text{Å}.
   \]

4. **Convert the total length to centimeters**:  
   Since \(1 \, \text{Å} = 10^{-8} \, \text{cm}\),  
   \[
   \text{Total length in cm} = 5 \times 10^8 \times 10^{-8} = 5 \, \text{cm}.
   \]

Thus, the total length of all the polypeptide chains in a single E. coli cell is **5.0 cm**, corresponding to option **C**.
