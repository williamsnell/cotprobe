Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is asking which group was converted to Christianity in the tenth century C.E. by missionaries from the Byzantine Empire. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that the Byzantine Empire was the Eastern Roman Empire, right? So they were involved in spreading Christianity, especially during certain periods. The tenth century is the 900s, so I need to think about which groups around that time were being missionized by them.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Goths. I think the Goths were a Germanic tribe. They were converted earlier, maybe in the 4th or 5th century. They had their own Christian sect, like Arianism. So probably not them in the 10th century.

Option B: Huns. The Huns were more around the 4th to 6th centuries. They were a nomadic people who invaded Europe. I don't think they were around much in the 10th century, and I don't recall the Byzantines converting them then. Maybe the Huns had already assimilated or moved on.

Option C: Normans. The Normans were originally Vikings who settled in France, right? They were converted to Christianity, but I think that was more through the influence of the Catholic Church, like in the 10th century. But wait, the question is about Byzantine missionaries. The Normans were more in the Latin (Western) Church's sphere, I think. So maybe not them.

Option D: Franks. The Franks were converted much earlier, like in the 5th and 6th centuries under Clovis. They were a key part of the Western Christian kingdoms. So tenth century is too late for their conversion.

Option E: Russians. Oh, I remember something about the Rus' people, who were the ancestors of the Russians. They were converted in the tenth century, and it was through the Byzantine Empire. I think there's a story about Vladimir the Great converting in 988, which would be in the late tenth century. So this seems like a strong candidate.

Option F: Anglo-Saxons. They were converted much earlier, like in the 6th and 7th centuries by missionaries from Rome, I believe. So not the tenth century.

Option G: Vandals. They were another Germanic tribe, active in the 5th and 6th centuries. They were Arians, but I think they were already converted before the tenth century. Plus, the Byzantines might not have been active in converting them by then.

Option H: Moors. The Moors were Muslim and occupied parts of Spain and North Africa. The Byzantines were involved in conflicts with them, but I don't think the Moors were converted by Byzantine missionaries in the tenth century. The Reconquista was happening around that time, but that's more about Christian kingdoms fighting back, not converting the Moors.

Option I: Celts. The Celts were in Britain and Ireland. They were Christianized much earlier, like by the 5th or 6th century, with missionaries like St. Patrick. So tenth century is too late.

Option J: Visigoths. They were another Germanic tribe, and they were Arians but converted to Catholic Christianity in the 6th or 7th centuries, I think. So again, tenth century is too late.

Putting it all together, the most likely group is the Russians, option E. The conversion of Kievan Rus' under Vladimir in 988 fits the time frame and the Byzantine missionaries. So I'll go with E.

The correct answer is E: Russians. The Kievan Rus', ancestors of the Russians, were converted to Christianity in the late tenth century, specifically around 988 C.E., through the influence of missionaries from the Byzantine Empire under the leadership of Vladimir the Great.

Answer: E
