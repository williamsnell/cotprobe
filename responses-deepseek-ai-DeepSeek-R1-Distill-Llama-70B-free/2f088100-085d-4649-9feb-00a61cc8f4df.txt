Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about tongue rolling and whether the students can do it or not. I remember that tongue rolling is a trait influenced by genetics. 

The question says that the ability to roll the tongue is conferred by a dominant gene. So, right, dominant genes mean that if you have at least one copy of the gene, you'll show the trait. The recessive allele doesn't let you roll your tongue. So, if someone can't roll their tongue, they must have two recessive alleles.

The problem states that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since they can't roll, that means they're homozygous recessive. Let me denote the dominant allele as R and the recessive as r. So those who can't roll are rr.

In a population, the frequency of the recessive phenotype (like not being able to roll) is given by q squared, where q is the frequency of the recessive allele. So, qÂ² = 0.16. I need to find q first. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives q = 0.4. So the frequency of the recessive allele r is 40% or 0.4.

Now, the question is asking for the percentage of students who are heterozygous. Heterozygous would mean they have one dominant and one recessive allele, so Rr.

In Hardy-Weinberg equations, the frequency of heterozygotes is given by 2pq. Where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive. Since p + q = 1, and q is 0.4, then p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

So plugging into 2pq: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48. 0.48 is 48%, right? So 48% of the students are heterozygous.

Looking at the options, option G is 48 percent. So the answer should be G.

To determine the percentage of students who are heterozygous for the tongue-rolling trait, we start by noting that 16% of the students cannot roll their tongues. Since the inability to roll the tongue is recessive, these students must be homozygous recessive (rr). 

In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the recessive phenotype is given by \( q^2 \), where \( q \) is the frequency of the recessive allele. Thus, \( q^2 = 0.16 \), and solving for \( q \), we find \( q = \sqrt{0.16} = 0.4 \). This means the frequency of the recessive allele \( r \) is 40%.

The dominant allele frequency \( p \) can be calculated as \( p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 \). The frequency of heterozygous individuals (Rr) is given by \( 2pq \). Substituting the values, we get:

\[
2pq = 2(0.6)(0.4) = 0.48
\]

This corresponds to 48% of the students being heterozygous. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

G: 48 per cent
