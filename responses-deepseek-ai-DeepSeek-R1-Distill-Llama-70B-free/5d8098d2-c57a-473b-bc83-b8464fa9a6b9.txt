Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and a charged disk. Hmm, I remember that the electric field near a charged disk can behave differently depending on where you're measuring it. The question is asking about the distance along the central axis where the field is half the value at the center of the disk's surface.

Wait, wait. The disk is uniformly charged and has a radius of 0.600 meters. The problem says the field at a certain point along the central axis is half the field at the center of the surface. I think I need to remember the formula for the electric field along the axis of a uniformly charged disk.

Oh right, I think the electric field at the center of the disk is zero because the contributions from all the charges cancel out symmetrically. But wait, no, wait, no—wait, the center of the disk's surface is a point on the disk itself, not along the axis. Oh wait, no—no, the center of the disk's surface is the point right at the center, which is on the axis where the perpendicular line passes through. So the field at the center is zero? Or is that the center of a uniformly charged spherical shell?

Wait, no, I think for a disk, the field at the center is actually zero because the field vectors from all the infinitesimal charge elements cancel each other out symmetrically. But wait, that's for points along the axis. Wait no, for the center point, which is on the axis, yeah, the field would be zero because of symmetry.

Wait, but in the problem, it's comparing the field at a point along the axis to the field at the center of the surface. Wait, no, if the center of the surface is on the axis, then the field there is zero. But that can't be right because the problem says it's half of that. Oh wait, maybe I'm confusing with the center of a sphere or something else.

Wait, no, maybe I got it wrong. Let me think again. The electric field at the center of a conducting charged sphere is zero, but a charged disk is a different situation. Hmm.

Wait, no, the electric field along the axis of a uniformly charged disk is given by the formula E = (σ/(2ε₀)) * (1 - (z/√(z² + R²)) ), where σ is the surface charge density, ε₀ is vacuum permittivity, R is the radius of the disk, and z is the distance along the axis from the center.

Wait, but at the center, z is zero. Plugging z=0 into that formula, E becomes (σ/(2ε₀)) * (1 - 0) = σ/(2ε₀). So the field at the center is σ/(2ε₀).

Wait, but wait, no. When z is zero, the point is at the center of the disk. But wait, maybe I should think about the field at the surface's center. Oh wait, the surface's center is same as the center point, so when z approaches zero, the field approaches σ/(2ε₀). But wait, when z is zero, the point is exactly at the center of the disk.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the field at the center is zero. Now I'm getting confused. Let me make sure. For an infinite sheet of charge, the field is σ/(2ε₀) on each side. But for a finite disk, when you're at the center, the contributions from each part of the disk... Hmm, wait, the field should be zero at the center because of symmetry. Oh wait, but according to the formula I wrote earlier, when z is zero, E is σ/(2ε₀). That doesn't make sense because symmetry suggests it should be zero.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. The electric field along the axis of a uniformly charged disk at a distance z from the center is given by E = (σ/(2ε₀)) * (1 - z/√(z² + R²)) ) when z > 0.

Wait, when z approaches zero, E approaches (σ/(2ε₀))*(1 - 0) )= σ/(2ε₀), but that contradicts with the symmetry. So I must have made a mistake in remembering the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is E = (σ/(2ε₀)) * ( z / √(z² + R²) ) )? No, that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, maybe I should derive it. Let's consider a ring of charge with radius r, thickness dr, on the disk. The charge dq is σ * 2πr dr. The electric field from this ring at a distance z along the axis would be dE = (1/(4πε₀)) * (dq cosθ)/z², but wait, no, because the ring contributes to the field along the axis. Oh right, because of symmetry, all horizontal components cancel, so the field from the ring is along the axis. So each ring contributes dE = (1/(4πε₀)) * (σ * 2πr dr) * (z/(z² + r²)^(3/2)) ) ?

Wait, no, wait. The formula for the electric field from a ring at a distance z is dE = (1/(4πε₀)) * (σ * 2πr dr) * (z) / (r² + z²)^(3/2). Because the field from a ring is (λ/(4πε₀)) * z/( (z² + r²)^(3/2) )) ), and here λ is the charge per unit length, but in this case, it's a ring, so dq = σ * 2πr dr. So dE is (1/(4πε₀)) * (σ 2π r dr) * z / (r² + z²)^(3/2).

So integrating this from r=0 to R gives the total field E at distance z.

So E = ∫ dE from 0 to R.

So E = (σ z)/(2ε₀) ∫ [ r dr ] / (r² + z²)^(3/2) )

Let me make a substitution: Let u = r² + z². Then du/dr = 2r → r dr = du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ [ (du/2) ) / u^(3/2) ) ] from u=z² to u=R² + z².

So integral becomes (1/2) ∫ u^(-3/2) du from u = z² to u= R² + z².

The integral of u^(-3/2) is -2 u^(-1/2).

So (1/2) [ -2 u^(-1/2) ] evaluated from z² to R² + z².

So (1/2) [ -2 ( (R² + z²)^(-1/2) ) + 2 (z²)^(-1/2) ) ]

That simplifies to (1/2) [ 2 (1/z - 1/√(R² + z²)) ) ]

So the integral is (1/z - 1/√(R² + z²)).

So putting it back into E:

E = (σ z)/(2ε₀) * [ (1/z) - 1/√(R² + z^2) ) ]

Simplify this:

E = (σ z)/(2ε₀) [ 1/z - 1/√(R² + z²) )

The z in the numerator cancels with 1/z, so:

E = σ/(2ε₀) [ 1 - z/(√(R² + z²)) ) ]

So yes, the formula is E = (σ/(2ε₀)) (1 - z/√(z² + R²) )

Now, at z = 0, E = (σ/(2ε₀)) (1 - 0 ) = σ/(2ε₀ ), which contradicts my earlier thought that the field at the center would be zero. So why is that?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in thinking about the symmetry. Wait, the center of the disk is at z=0. So the field there is E = σ/(2ε₀). But wait, for an infinite sheet, the field is σ/(2ε₀) on each side, which makes sense because the field is uniform. But for a finite disk, perhaps the field at the center is the same as for an infinite sheet? But that seems counterintuitive because I thought the field would decrease as you move along the axis. Hmm, perhaps I'm not accounting for something correctly.

Wait, no. Let me think: For an infinite sheet, yes, the field is σ/(2ε₀) everywhere. For a finite disk, at the center (z=0), the field is also σ/(2ε₀). As z increases, the field decreases. So the problem says that at a certain distance along the axis, the field is half of the field at the center. Since the field at the center is E_0 = σ/(2ε₀), the target is E = E_0 / 2 = σ/(4ε₀).

So we set E(z) = σ/(4ε₀).

So:

σ/(4ε₀) = (σ/(2ε₀)) [ 1 - z/√(z² + R²) ]

Divide both sides by σ/(2ε₀):

(1/2) = 1 - z/√(z² + R²)

So:

z/√(z² + R²) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2

So:

z/(√(z² + R²)) = 1/2

Let's square both sides:

z²/(z² + R²) = 1/4

Multiply both sides by (z² + R²):

z² = (1/4)(z² + R²)

Expand:

z² = (1/4) z² + (1/4) R²

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominator:

4z² = z² + R²

Subtract z² from both sides:

3z² = R²

So z = R / sqrt(3)

Given R = 0.600 m,

z = 0.600 / sqrt(3) ≈ 0.600 / 1.732 ≈ 0.3464 meters.

Now, looking at the options, option G is 0.346 m. So the answer should be G.

To determine the distance along the central perpendicular axis of a uniformly charged plastic disk where the electric field is half the magnitude of the field at the center of the surface, we use the formula for the electric field along the axis of a uniformly charged disk:

\[
E(z) = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0} \left( 1 - \frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2 + R^2}} \right),
\]

where:
- \( \sigma \) is the surface charge density,
- \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space,
- \( R \) is the radius of the disk,
- \( z \) is the distance along the axis from the center.

At the center of the disk (\( z = 0 \)), the electric field is:

\[
E(0) = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}.
\]

The problem asks for the distance \( z \) where the field is half of this value, i.e., \( E(z) = \frac{1}{2} E(0) = \frac{\sigma}{4\varepsilon_0} \). Substituting this into the formula:

\[
\frac{\sigma}{4\varepsilon_0} = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0} \left( 1 - \frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2 + R^2}} \right).
\]

Dividing through by \( \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0} \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} = 1 - \frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2 + R^2}}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{z}{\sqrt{z^2 + R^2}} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{z^2}{z^2 + R^2} = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Multiplying through by \( z^2 + R^2 \):

\[
4z^2 = z^2 + R^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
3z^2 = R^2.
\]

Solving for \( z \):

\[
z = \frac{R}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

For a disk of radius \( R = 0.600 \, \mathrm{m} \):

\[
z = \frac{0.600}{\sqrt{3}} \approx \frac{0.600}{1.732} \approx 0.346 \, \mathrm{m}.
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is **option G: \( 0.346 \, \mathrm{m} \)**.
