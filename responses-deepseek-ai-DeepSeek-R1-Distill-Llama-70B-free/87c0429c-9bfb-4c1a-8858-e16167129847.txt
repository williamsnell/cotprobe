Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrostatic force between two point charges. Hmm, I remember that the force between two charges is calculated using Coulomb's Law. Right, Coulomb's Law says that the force is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

The formula, I think, is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r². Oh wait, yeah, where k is Coulomb's constant. Let me make sure I remember the value of k. Coulomb's constant is about 8.99 x 10^9 N·m²/C². Or wait, sometimes it's approximated as 9e9 for simplicity, but maybe I should use the more precise value here.

So the problem gives me q1 as 26.0 microCoulombs and q2 as -47.0 microCoulombs. Oh, wait, the force's magnitude is given, so the signs don't matter here because the magnitude will be positive. So I can just take the absolute values of the charges.

The force F is 5.70 N. I need to find the distance r between them.

Let me write down the numbers:

q1 = 26.0 μC = 26.0e-6 C

q2 = -47.0 μC, but the magnitude is 47.0e-6 C.

F = 5.70 N

k = 8.99e9 N·m²/C²

So plugging into Coulomb's Law:

F = k * |q1 * q2| / r²

I need to solve for r. Let me rearrange the formula to solve for r.

r² = (k * |q1 * q2|) / F

So then r = sqrt( (k * |q1 * q2|) / F )

Let me compute the numerator first: k * q1 * q2.

Calculating q1 * q2: 26e-6 C * 47e-6 C = (26 * 47) * 1e-12. Let me compute 26*47. 25*47 is 1175, plus 1*47 is 1222. So 1222e-12 C², which is 1.222e-9 C².

Then multiply by k: 8.99e9 * 1.222e-9 = ?

Wait, 8.99e9 * 1.222e-9 = (8.99 * 1.222) * (1e9 * 1e-9) = 8.99*1.222 * 1e0.

Calculating 8.99 * 1.222:

Let me see, 9 * 1.222 is about 11. (9 * 1.2 is 10.8, 9 * 0.022 is 0.198, total 10.8 + 0.198 = 10.998). But since it's 8.99, it's 0.01 less than 9. So 8.99 *1.222 = 10.998 - (0.01 * 1.222) = 10.998 - 0.01222 = 10.98578.

So the numerator is approximately 10.98578 N·m².

Wait, no, wait. Because k is 8.99e9, q1 q2 is 26e-6 * 47e-6 = 26*47=1222, so 1222e-12 C². So 8.99e9 * 1222e-12 = (8.99 * 1222) * 1e-3.

Wait, 8.99e9 * 1.222e-9 C² = 8.99 * 1.222 = approx 10.98 as before, so 10.98 N·m².

Wait no, 8.99e9 * 1.222e-9 = (8.99 * 1.222) * (1e9 * 1e-9) ) = 10.98 * 1e0 = 10.98 N·m².

Wait, but F is 5.70 N, so r squared is (10.98) / 5.70 = approx 1.926.

Wait, wait, no, let me compute exactly.

Wait, the exact calculation:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C² (wait, sometimes I use 8.99e9, but more accurately it's 8.9875517879e9, but maybe for this problem, let's use 8.99e9).

So let me compute q1 * q2: 26e-6 * 47e-6 = (26 *47)*1e-12 = 1222e-12 C² = 1.222e-9 C².

So k*q1*q2 = 8.99e9 * 1.222e-9 = (8.99 *1.222) * 1e0.

Calculate 8.99 *1.222:

Let me compute this more accurately.

1.222 * 8 = 9.776

1.222 * 0.99 = ?

0.99 *1.222 = 1.21778.

So 8.99 *1.222 = 8 *1.222 + 0.99 *1.222 = 9.776 + 1.21778 = 10.99378.

So 10.99378 N·m².

Now, F is 5.70 N. So r squared is (10.99378) / 5.70.

Calculating 10.99378 /5.70.

Let me compute that: 5.70 * 1.928 = ?

Wait, 5.7 * 1.9 = 10.83

5.7 * 1.928: Let me compute 5.7 *1.9 = 10.83, 5.7 *0.028=0.1596. So total 10.83 +0.1596=10.9896.

Which is very close to 10.99378. So 1.928 gives 10.9896, which is slightly less than 10.99378. The difference is 10.99378 -10.9896 = 0.00418.

So how much more than 1.928 is needed?

Each 0.001 in r would contribute 5.7 *0.001 =0.0057. Since we're 0.00418 short, we need about 0.00418 /5.7 ≈ 0.00073. So r is approximately 1.92873.

So r squared is approximately 1.9287, so r is sqrt(1.9287).

Wait, sqrt(1.92) is approximately 1.3856, because 1.385^2 = approx 1.92.

Wait, let me compute it accurately.

Calculating sqrt(1.9287):

Hmm, 1.385^2 = (1.3 + 0.085)^2 = 1.3^2 + 2*1.3*0.085 + 0.085^2 = 1.69 + 0.221 + 0.007225 = 1.918225.

Which is about 1.918, but we have 1.9287, which is a bit higher.

The difference is 1.9287 -1.918225 = 0.010475.

So, how much more than 1.385 is needed? Let's find x where (1.385 + x)^2 =1.9287.

Approximate using linear approximation.

f(x) = (a + x)^2 ≈ a² + 2 a x.

We have a=1.385, a²=1.918225.

We need a² + 2 a x = 1.9287.

So 1.918225 + 2*(1.385)*x =1.9287.

So 2*1.385 *x = 1.9287 - 1.918225 = 0.010475.

So 2.77 x =0.010475 → x≈ 0.010475/2.77 ≈ 0.003786.

So r ≈ 1.385 + 0.003786 ≈ 1.3888 meters.

So approximately 1.389 meters.

Wait, but let me check using a calculator method. Let me compute 1.388 squared.

1.388^2 = (1.3 + 0.088)^2 = 1.3^2 + 2*1.3*0.088 + 0.088^2 = 1.69 + 0.2288 + 0.007744 = 1.69 + 0.2288=1.9188 + 0.007744=1.926544.

Which is still less than 1.9287.

So 1.388^2 = 1.9265, 1.389^2 = ?

1.389^2 = (1.38 + 0.009)^2 = 1.38^2 + 2 *1.38 *0.009 + 0.009².

1.38^2 = 1.9044.

2*1.38*0.009=0.02484.

0.009²=0.000081.

So 1.9044 +0.02484=1.92924 +0.000081=1.929321.

Which is higher than 1.9287.

So between 1.388 and 1.389.

We have at 1.388: 1.9265

At 1.389: 1.9293

We need 1.9287, which is 1.9287 -1.9265 =0.0022 above 1.388.

The difference between 1.388 and 1.389 in their squares is 1.9293 -1.9265=0.0028.

So 0.0022/0.0028 ≈ 0.7857 of the way from 1.388 to 1.389.

So approx 1.388 + 0.7857 *0.001 = 1.388 + 0.0007857 ≈1.3887857.

So r≈1.3888 meters, which is approximately 1.389 m.

Looking at the options, let's see which one is closest.

Options:

A: 2.10 m

B: 1.85 m

C: 1.50 m

D: 1.39 m

E: 0.98 m

F: 1.20 m

G: 0.80 m

H: 1.75 m

I: 1.60 m

J: 1.05 m

So option D is 1.39 m, which is very close to our calculation of approximately 1.389 m. So the correct answer should be D.

To determine the distance between the two point charges \( q_1 = 26.0 \, \mu\mathrm{C} \) and \( q_2 = -47.0 \, \mu\mathrm{C} \), we use Coulomb's Law:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2}
\]

where \( F = 5.70 \, \mathrm{N} \) is the magnitude of the electrostatic force, \( k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N·m^2/C^2} \) is Coulomb's constant, and \( r \) is the distance between the charges. Rearranging for \( r \):

\[
r = \sqrt{\frac{k \cdot |q_1 \cdot q_2|}{F}}
\]

### Step 1: Convert charges to Coulombs
\[
q_1 = 26.0 \, \mu\mathrm{C} = 26.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C}, \quad q_2 = -47.0 \, \mu\mathrm{C} = 47.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( |q_1 \cdot q_2| \)
\[
|q_1 \cdot q_2| = (26.0 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot (47.0 \times 10^{-6}) = 1222 \times 10^{-12} = 1.222 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C^2}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( k \cdot |q_1 \cdot q_2| \)
\[
k \cdot |q_1 \cdot q_2| = (8.99 \times 10^9) \cdot (1.222 \times 10^{-9}) = 10.99378 \, \mathrm{N·m^2}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( r^2 \)
\[
r^2 = \frac{k \cdot |q_1 \cdot q_2|}{F} = \frac{10.99378}{5.70} \approx 1.926
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( r \)
\[
r = \sqrt{1.926} \approx 1.389 \, \mathrm{m}
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated distance is approximately \( 1.39 \, \mathrm{m} \), which matches option **D**.
