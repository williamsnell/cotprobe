Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's see if I can work through it. The question is about finding the limit as n approaches infinity of the expression 2/√π multiplied by √n times the integral from 0 to 1 of (1 - x²)^n dx.

Hmm, let me write that down to visualize it better. The expression is:

Limit as n→∞ of [ (2/√π) * √n * ∫₀¹ (1 - x²)^n dx ]

I remember that when dealing with integrals of the form ∫₀¹ (1 - x²)^n dx, especially for large n, the function (1 - x²)^n becomes sharply peaked around x=0. This is because as n increases, the maximum of the function moves towards x=0 and the width around it narrows. So maybe I can approximate this integral using Laplace's method or something similar for integrals with a parameter that becomes large.

Wait, Laplace's method is for integrals of the form ∫ e^{n f(x)} dx, where we expand around the maximum of f(x). In this case, our integrand is (1 - x²)^n, which can be written as e^{n ln(1 - x²)}. So yes, that fits the form for Laplace's method.

The maximum of the function ln(1 - x²) occurs where the derivative is zero. Let's compute the derivative:

d/dx [ln(1 - x²)] = (-2x)/(1 - x²).

Setting this equal to zero gives x=0. So the maximum is at x=0. That makes sense because near x=0, (1 - x²) is largest, so raising it to the nth power makes the peak there.

Now, to apply Laplace's method, I need to expand ln(1 - x²) around x=0. Let's do a Taylor expansion:

ln(1 - x²) ≈ -x² - (x^4)/2 - ... 

But since we're looking for the leading term that contributes to the integral as n becomes large, higher-order terms beyond x² can be neglected in the exponent. So, approximately:

ln(1 - x²) ≈ -x².

So, (1 - x^2)^n ≈ e^{-n x²}.

But wait, that's just the leading behavior near x=0. So the integral becomes approximately ∫₀¹ e^{-n x²} dx. But since the integrand is significant only near x=0, I can extend the upper limit to infinity, because the contribution from x>1 is negligible for large n. So:

∫₀¹ (1 - x²)^n dx ≈ ∫₀^∞ e^{-n x²} dx.

But wait, the original function (1 - x²) is only valid for x ≤ 1, so for x >1, it's zero. But for large n, the contribution beyond x=1 is negligible, so extending to infinity is a good approximation.

However, wait a second: when we approximate (1 - x²)^n as e^{-n x²}, isn't that only valid for small x? Because for x approaching 1, (1 - x²) is small, but in the approximation, e^{-n x²} would not capture that correctly. Anyway, I think for the purpose of Laplace's method, the main contribution is around x=0, so maybe the approximation is still valid.

So, the integral ∫₀¹ (1 - x²)^n dx ≈ ∫₀^∞ e^{-n x²} dx.

But wait, the integral of e^{-a x²} from 0 to ∞ is (1/2)√(π/a), right? So here a is n, so the integral becomes (1/2)√(π/n).

But wait, our approximation gives ∫₀^∞ e^{-n x²} dx = (1/2)√(π/n).

So putting it together, the integral is approximately (1/2)√(π/n).

Wait, but wait, (1/2)√(π/n) comes from ∫₀^∞ e^{-n x²} dx.

So the original expression in the problem is:

(2/√π) * √n * [ ∫₀¹ (1 - x²)^n dx ] ≈ (2/√π) * √n * (1/2)√(π/n) )

Let me compute this.

First, √n multiplied by 1/√n is 1. So:

(2/√π) * [ √n * (1/2)√(π/n) ) ] = (2/√π) * (1/2) * √π * ( √n / √n )

Wait, let's compute it step by step.

√n * (1/2)√(π/n) = (1/2) * √n * √π / √n ) = (1/2) * √π.

So then:

(2/√π) * (1/2) * √π = (2/√π) * ( (√π)/2 ) ) = (2 * √pi) / (2 * √pi ) ) = 1.

Wait, that gives 1. So the limit is 1. So the correct answer would be I: 1.0.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the integral approximation might have some more factors. Let me check my steps again.

Alternative approach: Let me consider substitution. Let x = t / √n, then dx = dt / √n. But wait, when x approaches 0, and n is large, x² would be small.

Wait, but if I set x = t / √n, then x² = t² / n. So (1 - x²)^n = (1 - t²/n)^n ≈ e^{-t²} as n→infty.

So the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ (1 - x²)^n dx ≈ ∫₀^{√n} e^{-t²} * (dt / √n )

Because when x approaches 1, t = √n * x would be √n * 1, which for large n would be a large number, so extending the upper limit to infinity would be a good approximation.

So:

∫₀¹ (1 - x²)^n dx ≈ (1/√n) ∫₀^∞ e^{-t²} dt = (1/√n) * (√π / 2 )

So the integral is approximately (1/√n) * (√π / 2 )

Now, the expression in the problem is (2/√π) * √n * [ integral ]

So substituting the approximation:

(2/√π) * √n * [ (1/√n)(√π/2) ) ] = (2/√pi) * √n * ( √pi/(2 √n) ) )

Simplify:

(2/√pi) * (√n) * (√pi)/(2 √n) )

The √n cancels with 1/√n, and 2 cancels with 2 in the denominator. So we have (1/√pi) * √pi * (1) ) = 1.

So yes, the limit is 1. So the correct answer should be I: 1.0.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Because another approach could involve using the Beta function. The integral ∫₀¹ x^{2m} (1 - x²)^n dx can be expressed using the Beta function, but maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, I could consider using substitution. Let me try u = x², then du = 2x dx, but that might not help directly. Hmm, perhaps using substitution y = x√n, as I did earlier, is more helpful.

So I think my initial approach is correct. The limit is 1, so the answer is I.

To evaluate the limit 

\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \sqrt{n} \int_0^1 (1 - x^2)^n \, dx,
\]

we analyze the integral 

\[
\int_0^1 (1 - x^2)^n \, dx.
\]

For large \(n\), the integrand \((1 - x^2)^n\) is sharply peaked around \(x = 0\), and its behavior can be approximated using Laplace's method. Rewriting \((1 - x^2)^n\) as \(e^{n \ln(1 - x^2)}\), we note that the maximum of \(\ln(1 - x^2)\) occurs at \(x = 0\). Expanding \(\ln(1 - x^2)\) around \(x = 0\) gives:

\[
\ln(1 - x^2) \approx -x^2.
\]

Thus, for small \(x\), \((1 - x^2)^n \approx e^{-n x^2}\). The integral is then dominated by contributions near \(x = 0\), allowing us to extend the upper limit of integration to infinity as an approximation:

\[
\int_0^1 (1 - x^2)^n \, dx \approx \int_0^\infty e^{-n x^2} \, dx.
\]

The integral \(\int_0^\infty e^{-n x^2} \, dx\) is a standard Gaussian integral, which evaluates to:

\[
\int_0^\infty e^{-n x^2} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{n}}.
\]

Substituting this result back into the original expression, we have:

\[
\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \sqrt{n} \int_0^1 (1 - x^2)^n \, dx \approx \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \sqrt{n} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{n}}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \sqrt{n} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{n}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} = 1.
\]

Thus, the limit is:

\[
\boxed{1}.
\]

The correct answer is **I: 1.0**.
