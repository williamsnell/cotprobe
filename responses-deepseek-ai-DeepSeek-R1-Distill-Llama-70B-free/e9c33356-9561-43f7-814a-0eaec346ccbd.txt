Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrostatic force between two ions. Hmm, I remember that Coulomb's Law is involved here. Let me think about what I know.

The question states that two identical ions are separated by a distance of 5.0e-10 meters, and the force between them is 3.7e-9 Newtons. I need to find the charge of each ion.

Wait, Coulomb's Law formula is F = k * (q1 * q2) / r². Oh right, and since the ions are identical, their charges are the same. So q1 equals q2, which is q. So the formula simplifies to F = k * q² / r².

I need to solve for q. So rearranging the formula, q² = (F * r²) / k. Then take the square root.

Let me plug in the numbers. F is 3.7e-9 N, r is 5e-10 m, and k is Coulomb's constant, which I remember is about 8.99e9 N·m²/C².

Calculating the denominator first: r squared is (5e-10)^2 = 25e-20, which is 2.5e-19. Wait, wait, 5 squared is 25, and (1e-10)^2 is 1e-20, so 25e-20 is 2.5e-19? Wait, no, 25e-20 is 2.5e-19? Wait, 25e-20 is 2.5e-19 because 25 * 1e-20 = 2.5 * 1e-19. Yeah, that's right.

Multiply F and r squared: 3.7e-9 * 2.5e-19. Let me compute that. 3.7 * 2.5 is 9.25, and the exponents are 10^-9 * 10^-19 = 10^-28. So 9.25e-28.

Now divide by k, which is 8.99e9. So (9.25e-28) / (8.99e9) = approx 1.03e-38? Let me check the calculation. Wait, 9.25 / 8.99 is approximately 1.03 (since 8.99 is almost 9, 9.25/9 is about 1.027). So 1.027e-28-9 = 1.027e-37? Wait, wait, no.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let's see: 9.25e-28 divided by 8.99e9 is (9.25 / 8.99) * (1e-28 / 1e9) = approx 1.03 * 1e-37, so 1.03e-37.

Wait, no: 1e-28 / 1e9 is 1e-37. So yes, 1.03e-37.

Now I take the square root of that to find q. So sqrt(1.03e-37) = sqrt(1.03) * sqrt(1e-37). The square root of 1.03 is approximately 1.015, and sqrt(1e-37) is 1e-18.5, which is 3.16e-19. Because 1e-18 is 1e-18, and sqrt(1e-37) is sqrt(1e-36 * 1e-1}) ) = 1e-18 * 0.316 approximately.

Wait, let me think again. 1e-37 is (1e-18.5)^2. So sqrt(1e-37) is 1e-18.5, which is 3.16e-19 when written in proper scientific notation. Because 10^-18.5 = 10^(-18) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 3.16e-19.

So multiplying by 1.015, which is about 1.015 * 3.16e-19. Let me compute that: 1.015 * 3.16 is approximately 3.21. So the charge q is approximately 3.21e-19 C.

Wait, let me check the options. Looking at the options, I see option F is 3.2e-19 C. Option G is 4.8e-19. Option D is 3.6e-19. Hmm, but my calculation is 3.21e-19, which would be closest to option F.

Wait, but wait another moment. Did I make any calculation mistakes? Let me go through the steps again carefully.

F = 3.7e-9 N, r = 5e-10 m.

r squared is (5e-10)^2 = 25e-20 = 2.5e-19 m².

F*r² = 3.7e-9 * 2.5e-19 = (3.7 * 2.5) * 1e-28 = 9.25e-28.

Divide by k (8.99e9): 9.25e-28 / 8.99e9 = (9.25 / 8.99) * 1e-37.

9.25 / 8.99 is approximately 1.029, so 1.029e-37.

Taking square root: sqrt(1.029e-37) = sqrt(1.029) * sqrt(1e-37) = approx 1.0145 * 3.16e-19.

1.0145 *3.16 is about 3.21, so 3.21e-19 C. So that's matching option F, which is 3.2e-19 C.

Wait, but the option F is written as 3.2 10^-19, which is 3.2e-19, yes.

So the correct answer should be option F.

But wait, I'm looking back at the options. Let me check again.

Options:

A: 1e-19

B:4.2e-19

C:2e-18

D:3.6e-19

E:1.6e-19

F:3.2e-19

G:4.8e-19

H:2.8e-19

I:6.4e-19

J:5e-19

Yes, so option F is 3.2e-19, which matches our calculation. So the answer is F.

To determine the charge of each ion, we use Coulomb's Law:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{q_1 \cdot q_2}{r^2}
\]

Since the ions are identical, \( q_1 = q_2 = q \), so the formula simplifies to:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{q^2}{r^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( q^2 \):

\[
q^2 = \frac{F \cdot r^2}{k}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
q = \sqrt{\frac{F \cdot r^2}{k}}
\]

### Step 1: Substitute the given values
- \( F = 3.7 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{N} \)
- \( r = 5.0 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \)
- \( k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \)

First, calculate \( r^2 \):

\[
r^2 = (5.0 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 25 \times 10^{-20} = 2.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{m^2}
\]

Next, calculate \( F \cdot r^2 \):

\[
F \cdot r^2 = (3.7 \times 10^{-9}) \cdot (2.5 \times 10^{-19}) = 9.25 \times 10^{-28} \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2}
\]

Now divide by \( k \):

\[
\frac{F \cdot r^2}{k} = \frac{9.25 \times 10^{-28}}{8.99 \times 10^9} \approx 1.03 \times 10^{-37} \, \mathrm{C^2}
\]

Take the square root:

\[
q = \sqrt{1.03 \times 10^{-37}} = \sqrt{1.03} \cdot \sqrt{10^{-37}} \approx 1.015 \cdot 3.16 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C}
\]

\[
q \approx 3.21 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C}
\]

### Step 2: Match the result to the options
The closest option to \( 3.21 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \) is **option F: \( 3.2 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \)**.

### Final Answer:
F
