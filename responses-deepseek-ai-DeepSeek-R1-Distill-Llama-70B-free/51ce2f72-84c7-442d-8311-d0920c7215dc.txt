Okay, so I've got this problem here about a first-order reaction. Let's see, first-order reactions have a specific rate constant, k, and I remember the formula involves exponential decay. The question gives me k as 86 per hour, but wait, the time given is in seconds. Oh, right, I need to convert units so they match.

So the problem says the rate constant k is 86 h^-1. But the time is 58 seconds. Hmm, I should convert 86 h^-1 to per second. Let me think, 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So 86 divided by 3600 is... let me calculate that. 86 / 3600. Let's see, 86 divided by 3600. Well, 3600 is 3.6e3. So 86 / 3.6e3 is approximately 0.02389 s^-1. I'll just write that as about 0.02389 per second.

Wait, but first-order reactions use the formula ln([A]0/[A]) = kt. Oh wait, but wait, because the question is about mass, not concentration. Oh wait, but for a first-order reaction, the formula still applies because it's based on the concentration, which for a given mass and volume is proportional. Since the problem gives mass and the initial mass, assuming the volume is constant, the ratio would be the same as [A]0/[A]. So I can treat the mass ratio the same way.

Wait, but wait, the initial mass is 0.0500 grams. So [A]0 is 0.0500 g, and [A] is the mass remaining after time t. The time t is 58 seconds. So I can plug into the formula:

ln([A]/[A]0) = -kt, but wait, no, wait: the formula is ln([A]0/[A]) = kt.

So rearranging, [A] = [A]0 * e^(-kt).

So plugging the numbers in: [A] = 0.0500 g * e^(-0.02389 * 58).

Wait, let me calculate 0.02389 multiplied by 58. Let me compute 0.02389 * 60 first, which would be approximately 1.4334, but since it's 58, it's 1.4334 minus 0.02389 * 2, which is 0.04778. So 1.4334 - 0.04778 = approximately 1.3856.

So the exponent is -1.3856. Then e^(-1.3856) is about... I need to compute that. I know that e^1 is about 2.718, so e^1.386 is roughly 4, because ln(4) is about 1.386. So e^(-1.386) would be 1/4, which is 0.25. But wait, our exponent is -1.3856, which is almost exactly -1.386, so e^-1.3856 is roughly 0.25.

So [A] = 0.0500 g * 0.25 = 0.0125 g. Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 0.0125 g. So the answer should be D. But wait, let me double-check because approximating e^-1.3856 as exactly 0.25 might not be precise. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, let me use a calculator approach. Let's compute 0.02389 * 58 precisely.

0.02389 * 58:

58 is 50 + 8.

0.02389 *50 = 1.1945.

0.02389 *8 = 0.19112.

Total is 1.1945 + 0.19112 = 1.38562.

So exponent is -1.38562.

Now, e^-1.38562. Let me compute e^1.38562. I know that e^1 = 2.71828, e^0.3 is about 1.34986, e^0.08 is about 1.08328, e^0.00562 is approximately 1.00564.

Wait, maybe a better approach: 1.38562 can be split into 1 + 0.3 + 0.08 + 0.00562.

Wait, alternatively, using natural logarithm tables or a calculator. Alternatively, I remember that ln(4) is about 1.3863, which is very close to 1.38562. So e^1.38562 is approximately 3.995, which is almost 4. So e^-1.38562 is about 0.25025.

Then, [A] = 0.0500 g * 0.25025 â‰ˆ 0.0125125 g. So approximately 0.0125 g, which is option D. So the correct answer is D.

To solve the problem, we use the first-order reaction formula:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{[A]_0}{[A]}\right) = kt
\]

Rearranging for \([A]\), the mass of the starting material remaining after time \(t\):

\[
[A] = [A]_0 \cdot e^{-kt}
\]

### Step 1: Convert the rate constant \(k\) to seconds
The given rate constant is \(k = 86 \, \text{h}^{-1}\). Since \(1 \, \text{h} = 3600 \, \text{s}\), we convert \(k\) to seconds:

\[
k = \frac{86}{3600} \approx 0.02389 \, \text{s}^{-1}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the exponent
The time is \(t = 58 \, \text{s}\). The exponent is:

\[
-kt = -(0.02389)(58) \approx -1.3856
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(e^{-1.3856}\)
Using approximations, \(e^{-1.3856} \approx 0.25\) because \(\ln(4) \approx 1.386\), and \(e^{-1.386} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25\).

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining mass
The initial mass is \([A]_0 = 0.0500 \, \text{g}\). Substituting into the formula:

\[
[A] = 0.0500 \cdot 0.25 = 0.0125 \, \text{g}
\]

### Final Answer
The mass of the starting material remaining after 58 seconds is approximately \(0.0125 \, \text{g}\), which corresponds to **option D**.
