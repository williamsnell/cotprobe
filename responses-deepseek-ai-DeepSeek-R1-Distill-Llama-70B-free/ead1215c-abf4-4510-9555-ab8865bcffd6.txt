The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A person who has had an opportunity to contribute to the establishmentof objectives regarding his or her performance willhave a greater degree of commitment and motivation in attemptingto achieve those objectives. State and discuss thetheory underlying this statement. How is itimplemented practicallyto motivate employees ?

Options:

A: The theory is the Hierarchy of Needs by Maslow, and it is implemented by providing employees with a path for career progression and fulfilling higher-level needs.
B: The theory is implemented through punishments and rewards
C: The theory is known as the Two-Factor Theory by Herzberg, which is applied by addressing hygiene factors and providing intrinsic motivators such as recognition and achievement.
D: The theory is implemented through increasing employee's workload
E: The theory is implemented through strict supervision
F: The theory is known as the Equity Theory, which is put into practice by ensuring fair treatment of employees and balancing input and output ratios among workers.
G: The theory is the Self-Determination Theory, which is implemented by promoting autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the workplace.
H: The theory is the Social Learning Theory, and it is put into practice by using role models and mentors to demonstrate desirable behaviors and outcomes.
I: The theory underlying this statement is Management by Objectives (MBO), which involves mutual goal-setting between employees and management. It is practically implemented through programs such as job simplification, job enrichment, suggestion plans, and job redesign.
J: The theory is based on the Expectancy Theory of motivation, implemented through clear communication of performance criteria and linking outcomes directly to performance.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question to tackle, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is talking about a person who helps set their own performance objectives and how that affects their commitment and motivation. I need to identify the underlying theory and how it's implemented.

Hmm, I remember that there are several motivation theories. Let me think. The first one that comes to mind is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. That's about different levels of needs, from basic to self-actualization. But does it relate to setting goals? Maybe not directly. It's more about fulfilling needs through the workplace.

Then there's Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory, which talks about hygiene factors and motivators. Hygiene factors prevent dissatisfaction, while motivators like recognition and achievement improve satisfaction. But the question is about setting objectives, so I'm not sure if this fits.

I also recall the Equity Theory, which deals with fairness and balance between what employees put in and what they get out. Ensuring fair treatment might influence motivation, but again, it's not directly about setting objectives.

Oh wait, Management by Objectives (MBO) sounds relevant here. MBO involves setting clear goals in collaboration between employees and management. The idea is that when employees participate in setting their objectives, they're more committed to achieving them. That makes sense because involvement gives them a sense of ownership.

Looking at the options, option I says it's MBO and mentions practical implementations like job simplification, enrichment, suggestion plans, etc. That seems to fit the description in the question.

Other options: Option J mentions Expectancy Theory, which is about linking outcomes to performance. That's also about motivation but more about the expectation of rewards rather than setting the goals themselves.

Option A is Maslow, which we thought doesn't fit. Option C is Herzberg, which is about different factors but not goal setting. So, I think the correct answer is I.

The correct answer is based on the Management by Objectives (MBO) theory, which emphasizes mutual goal-setting between employees and management to enhance commitment and motivation.

Answer: I
