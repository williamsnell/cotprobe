Question:

Arthropods have an exoskeleton. How is movement accomplished?

Options:

A: They use their wings to move
B: They move by changing the shape of their exoskeleton
C: They use cilia on the surface of their exoskeleton to move
D: They move due to their muscular system
E: They have a soft, pliable inner layer that bends to facilitate movement
F: Movement is achieved through hydraulic pressure changes within each segment
G: They release a special fluid that lubricates the joints of the exoskeleton for movement
H: The exoskeleton contracts and expands allowing for movement
I: Movement is achieved by the exoskeleton splitting and reforming in new positions
J: The body is segmented and the segments are joined by a thin layer of flexible chitin

Okay, so I have this question about arthropods and their movement. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking how arthropods accomplish movement, given that they have an exoskeleton.

First, I remember that arthropods include insects, crustaceans, arachnids, and others. They all have an exoskeleton, which is a hard outer covering. But how do they move with that? I mean, their skeleton is external, unlike ours which is internal.

Wait, right, their exoskeleton is made of chitin. And I think it's segmented, which probably allows for some flexibility. But movement itselfâ€”how does that happen? I think it's related to muscles. Since the exoskeleton is hard, they must have muscles attached to it somehow.

Oh wait, in insects, for example, they have muscles that connect inside the exoskeleton. When these muscles contract, they can move parts of the exoskeleton. Like how the legs move. But the exoskeleton itself doesn't change shape much because it's rigid. So the movement must come from the muscles pulling on the skeleton.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. Option A says they use wings to move. Well, not all arthropods have wings. Spiders don't, for instance. So that's probably not the general answer.

Option B: Move by changing exoskeleton shape. But the exoskeleton is rigid, so that doesn't make sense. They can't really change the shape much.

Option C: Cilia on exoskeleton. I don't think arthropods use cilia for movement. Maybe some other organisms, like protozoans, but not arthropods.

Option D: Muscular system. That sounds right. They have muscles that move the appendages attached to the exoskeleton.

Option E: Soft inner layer bending. I'm not sure. Exoskeleton has a hard outer layer, but maybe there's some flexibility in the joints. But the main movement is via muscles, not just bending.

Option F: Hydraulic pressure changes. I think some worms use that, like earthworms, but arthropods don't. They don't have fluid-filled bodies in the same way.

Option G: Lubricating joints with fluid. Maybe, but that's more about reducing friction rather than causing movement itself. The movement is still from muscles.

Option H: Exoskeleton contracts and expands. Again, the exoskeleton is rigid, so it doesn't contract or expand much. So this might not be right.

Option I: Exoskeleton splitting and reforming. That sounds like molting, which is how they grow, not how they move.

Option J: Segmented body with flexible joints. Yes, their bodies are segmented, and the joints between segments are flexible, allowing movement. So this is also a possibility. But how does the movement occur? Is it the structure allowing it, or the muscles causing it?

Wait, the question is how movement is accomplished. So the structure (joints) allows for movement, but the muscles are what cause it. So the actual movement is due to the muscles. So option D would be about the muscular system, which is the correct mechanism.

Wait, but another thought: in arthropods, each segment has muscles. So when the muscles contract, they pull on the exoskeleton, moving the legs or appendages. So yeah, it's the muscles that cause movement.

So the answer should be D: They move due to their muscular system.

But wait, option J is about the body being segmented with flexible joints. That's a correct fact about arthropods. But does that explain how movement is accomplished? The segmentation allows for movement, but the actual movement is caused by muscles. So maybe J is a part of the reason, but not the direct cause.

So the question is, which option correctly answers how movement is accomplished. Since muscles are responsible for movement, option D is the correct answer.

Arthropods, such as insects, crustaceans, and arachnids, have an exoskeleton made of chitin, which provides structural support but is rigid. Movement in these organisms is not accomplished by changing the shape of the exoskeleton, as it is not flexible. Instead, movement is made possible by the contraction and relaxation of muscles attached to the internal surface of the exoskeleton. These muscles pull on the exoskeleton, allowing for the movement of appendages like legs and wings. While segmentation and flexible joints in the exoskeleton facilitate movement by providing points of articulation, the actual mechanism of movement is driven by the muscular system.

Option D correctly identifies that movement is due to the muscular system, which is the primary mechanism enabling arthropods to move.

Answer: D
