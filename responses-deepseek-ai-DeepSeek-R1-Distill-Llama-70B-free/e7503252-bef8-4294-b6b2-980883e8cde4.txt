The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Suppose a farmer has just 2 acres of land. He finds from experience that these 2 acres are equally prolific in the production of corn and wheat. Specifically, he has found that each acre is capable of producing either 20 bushels of wheat or 20 bushels of corn. Suppose, too, that no matter how our farmer decides to apportion his 2 acres be-tween wheat and corn , his total costs of production remain at $25. If the price of corn is $1 per bushel and that of wheat is $2 per bushel, what will the farmer do to maximize his profits?

Options:

A: Lease the land to another farmer
B: Plant all his land in wheat
C: Use one acre for organic wheat and the other for genetically modified corn
D: Plant 1.5 acres of wheat and 0.5 acres of corn
E: Plant corn in the first year and wheat in the second year
F: Plant all his land in corn
G: Split his land equally between corn and wheat
H: Plant alternating rows of corn and wheat in each acre
I: Not plant anything
J: Plant 1.5 acres of corn and 0.5 acres of wheat

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics problem about a farmer maximizing his profits. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The farmer has 2 acres of land. Each acre can produce either 20 bushels of wheat or 20 bushels of corn. So, per acre, it's 20 bushels regardless of which crop. The total production cost is $25, no matter how he splits the land between the two crops. 

The prices are important here: corn is $1 per bushel, and wheat is $2 per bushel. The question is asking what the farmer should do to maximize his profits. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. Let me break this down. Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs. The costs are fixed at $25, so I don't need to worry about varying costs depending on the crop mix. So the key is to maximize revenue because the costs are the same regardless.

Each acre can produce 20 bushels. So if he uses one acre for wheat, that's 20 bushels, and the same for corn. But since wheat is priced higher, each bushel of wheat gives more money.

Let me calculate the revenue for different scenarios.

Option B says plant all land in wheat. So 2 acres * 20 bushels = 40 bushels. At $2 each, that's 40 * 2 = $80. Then subtract the $25 cost, so profit would be $55.

Option F is all corn. 2 acres * 20 =40 bushels. At $1 each, that's $40. Subtract $25, profit is $15.

Option G is splitting equally. So 1 acre each. Wheat gives 20 * $2 = $40. Corn gives 20 * $1 = $20. Total revenue $60. Profit $35.

Option J is 1.5 acres corn and 0.5 wheat. Let's see: 1.5*20=30 corn bushels. 0.5*20=10 wheat. Revenue: (30 *1)+(10 *2) = $30 + $20 = $50. Profit $25.

Option D is 1.5 wheat, 0.5 corn: 1.5*20=30 wheat, 0.5*20=10 corn. Revenue: 30*2=60 +10*1=10. Total $70. Profit $45.

Wait, so with option D, he gets higher revenue than option B? Wait, no. Because if he plants 1.5 acres in wheat, that's 30 bushels. 30 * $2 = $60. And 0.5 acres of corn is 10 bushels at $1, so $10. So total revenue is $70. Then subtract $25, profit is $45.

Wait, but if he plants all 2 acres in wheat, he gets 40 bushels * $2 = $80 revenue. Profit $55. That's higher than option D's $70 revenue. Wait, no, $80 is higher than $70. So why would D be better?

Oh wait, no, 1.5 acres in wheat and 0.5 in corn gives 30 + 10 bushels. That's 40 bushels total, but mixed. Wait no, wait. Each acre is either corn or wheat. So 1.5 acres wheat is 30 bushels, 0.5 acres corn is 10 bushels. So total revenue is 30*2 + 10*1 = 60 +10=70. Profit 70-25=45.

But if he plants all in wheat, 40 bushels *2=80. Profit 80-25=55. That's better.

So the maximum profit is when he plants all land in wheat. So option B would be the correct choice.

Wait, but let me check other options.

Option C: organic wheat and GM corn. Not sure how that affects yield. The problem doesn't mention any difference in production or price for organic or GM, so I think it's a trick option. Probably same as planting regular, so profit same as G or something.

Option E: plant corn first year, wheat second. But the problem doesn't mention anything about crop rotation or multi-year planning. The question is about what to do now, so this seems irrelevant.

Option I: not plant anything. That would give 0 revenue, so profit is -$25, which is worse than any option.

Option A: lease land. The problem doesn't mention leasing, so I don't know the details. But if he can get more than $25 by leasing, maybe, but the question is about planting. So probably not the best option.

Option H: alternating rows. I don't think that changes anything since each acre is either corn or wheat, regardless of how they're planted within the acre. So it's same as splitting, maybe, but the question says each acre is either all wheat or all corn, so H doesn't make sense.

So the best is to plant all in wheat, which is option B. That gives the highest revenue, thus highest profit.

The farmer has 2 acres of land, each capable of producing 20 bushels of either wheat or corn. The total cost of production is $25, regardless of how the land is allocated. The price of wheat is $2 per bushel, and the price of corn is $1 per bushel. To maximize profit, the farmer should focus on maximizing revenue since costs are fixed.

- **Option B (Plant all land in wheat):**  
  2 acres * 20 bushels/acre = 40 bushels of wheat.  
  Revenue = 40 bushels * $2/bushel = $80.  
  Profit = $80 - $25 = $55.  

- **Option F (Plant all land in corn):**  
  2 acres * 20 bushels/acre = 40 bushels of corn.  
  Revenue = 40 bushels * $1/bushel = $40.  
  Profit = $40 - $25 = $15.  

- **Option G (Split land equally between corn and wheat):**  
  1 acre of wheat = 20 bushels * $2/bushel = $40.  
  1 acre of corn = 20 bushels * $1/bushel = $20.  
  Total revenue = $40 + $20 = $60.  
  Profit = $60 - $25 = $35.  

- **Option D (1.5 acres of wheat and 0.5 acres of corn):**  
  1.5 acres of wheat = 30 bushels * $2/bushel = $60.  
  0.5 acres of corn = 10 bushels * $1/bushel = $10.  
  Total revenue = $60 + $10 = $70.  
  Profit = $70 - $25 = $45.  

- **Option J (1.5 acres of corn and 0.5 acres of wheat):**  
  1.5 acres of corn = 30 bushels * $1/bushel = $30.  
  0.5 acres of wheat = 10 bushels * $2/bushel = $20.  
  Total revenue = $30 + $20 = $50.  
  Profit = $50 - $25 = $25.  

Among all options, planting all 2 acres in wheat (Option B) yields the highest revenue ($80) and profit ($55). Other options, such as splitting the land or planting all corn, result in lower profits. Therefore, the farmer should plant all his land in wheat to maximize profits.

**Answer: B**
