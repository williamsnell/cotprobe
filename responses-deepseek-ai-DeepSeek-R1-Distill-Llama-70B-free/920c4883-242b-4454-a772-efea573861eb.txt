Okay, so I've got this question about phishing attacks, and I need to figure out which option is least likely to indicate one. Hmm, I remember that phishing is when attackers try to trick you into giving out personal info, usually by pretending to be someone you trust.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: An email from a utility company asking for date of birth and social security number. That sounds suspicious because real companies usually don't ask for sensitive info via email. They’d probably direct you to their secure website or ask you to call them.

Option B: Social networking site email with a link to a photo or video. Phishing often uses links that look legit but take you to fake sites. So this could be a phishing attempt to get your login details.

Option C: Bank email asking for your password. Banks know better than to ask for passwords in emails because that's a big security no-no. So this is probably phishing.

Option D: Email saying you won money and need to provide bank account info. Classic phishing scam. Legit lotteries don't ask for your account details to send money; they’d have you claim it through secure means.

Option E: Merchant email to reset password via a link. This is a common phishing tactic. They might send you a link that looks real but is actually a fake site to steal your password.

Option F: IT department asking for login details. Phishing often spoofs IT or HR departments. They might say there's a system upgrade and ask for your credentials, which is a red flag.

Option G: Online retailer asking for payment card details. Retailers usually don’t email asking for payment info out of the blue. They’d direct you to their site through a secure connection, not via email links.

Option H: Bank email asking to call the number on your card. Wait, banks often do this. If they suspect a fraudulent transaction, they might email you to call the number on the back of your card. But wait, is this a trick? Because some phishing emails might provide a fake number. But in this case, the instruction is to call the number on your card, which is something legitimate banks do. So this might not be phishing.

So, looking at all options, H seems different. The others are more clearly phishing attempts because they ask for sensitive info directly or via links. Option H tells you to use the number on your card, which is a secure method. So the least likely to be phishing is H.

The least likely option to indicate a phishing attack is:

H: An e-mail from your bank asks you to call the number on your card to verify a transaction.

This is because legitimate banks often instruct customers to call the number on the back of their card for verification, making this request less indicative of a phishing attempt compared to the other options.

Answer: H
