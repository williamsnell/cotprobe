Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about warranties in sales, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a buyer purchases an item from a merchant, and the item turns out to be unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes. And we have to assume there are no other warranties. The options are various types of warranties, and we're supposed to pick which one the buyer can invoke.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that there are different kinds of warranties under sales law. Let me think. There's the implied warranty of merchantability and the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. I think those are the two main ones.

So, the item here is unfit, defective, and unsafe. That sounds like it's not suitable for its ordinary use. So the question is about the general purpose of the item. I think the warranty of merchantability covers that. Merchantability means that the goods are fit for their ordinary purpose, right? So if the item is defective and not fit for ordinary use, the buyer can claim under the warranty of merchantability.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing it with fitness for a particular purpose. I remember that the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is when the buyer has a specific use in mind, and the seller knows that. For example, if I buy a tire for racing and the seller recommends a certain type, but it fails, that's fitness for a particular purpose.

In this question, the problem is about the ordinary purposes, so it's the general use, not a specific purpose. So the warranty of merchantability should apply here.

Looking back at the options, option C is the warranty of merchantability. Option F is fitness for a particular purpose, which doesn't fit here because the question doesn't mention a specific purpose beyond ordinary use.

So the correct answer should be C.

The buyer can invoke the warranty of merchantability because the item is unfit for its ordinary purpose.

Answer: C
