Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the width of a belt used on a pulley. Let me try to break this down. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

The question says it's a medium double-ply flat leather belt. The pulley has a 15-inch diameter and is mounted on a squirrel cage induction motor. The motor is rated at 25 hp and runs at 1500 rpm, and it's located in a dusty environment.

I remember that belt width depends on several factors, including the power transmitted, the speed of the motor, and the type of belt. Since it's a medium double-ply belt, I think that refers to the belt's thickness and durability, which might affect the width.

First, I think I should calculate the belt speed because that relates to the power. The formula for belt speed is (π * diameter * rpm) / 60. Let me plug in the numbers: diameter is 15 inches, rpm is 1500.

So, belt speed (in inches per minute) would be π * 15 * 1500 / 60. Let me calculate that. 

15 * 1500 = 22500. Divided by 60 gives 375. Multiply by π (approx 3.1416) gives about 1178.1 inches per minute. Wait, but wait, that's inches per minute. Oh, right, because 15 inches is the diameter. 

Now, power is usually related to the belt's width and speed. I remember that the horsepower (hp) can be determined by the formula: hp = (belt width in inches) * (belt speed in feet per minute) * (some factor based on the belt type and service). 

Wait, I think the formula is something like hp = (P * v * k) / 1000, where P is the belt width, v is the belt speed in feet per minute, and k is a factor depending on belt type and service conditions.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula for power transmitted by a belt: Power (hp) = (T * v) / 550, where T is the tension in pounds and v is the belt speed in feet per minute. But I'm not sure about the tension here.

Wait, maybe I should use a standard formula or table. I recall that for V-belts, there's a method based on the power and the belt speed to determine the belt width, but since this is a flat belt, maybe it's a bit different.

Alternatively, I've heard about the "horsepower per inch of belt width" being a factor. For example, for different belt types, the horsepower they can handle per inch varies. For instance, a single-ply belt might handle 0.5 hp per inch, while a double-ply could handle 1.0 hp per inch. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the problem says it's a medium double-ply flat leather belt. So maybe the horsepower per inch is higher. Let me think: I think for a double-ply belt, it's around 1.5 to 2.0 hp per inch of width. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's 1 hp per inch for a double-ply.

So, given that, the total hp is 25. If the belt can handle, say, 1 hp per inch, then the width would be 25 inches. But that seems way too big because the pulley is only 15 inches in diameter. That can't be right. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the belt speed in feet per minute. Let me recalculate that. The pulley diameter is 15 inches, so the circumference is π * 15 ≈ 47.12 inches. At 1500 rpm, that's 1500 revolutions per minute. So the belt speed is 47.12 * 1500 inches per minute.

47.12 * 1500 = 70680 inches per minute. To convert to feet, divide by 12: 70680 / 12 = 5890 feet per minute.

Now, the formula I think is Power (hp) = (P * v * f) / 1000, where P is width in inches, v is speed in feet per minute, and f is a factor depending on the belt type and service conditions.

I've seen factors like f for different conditions. For a leather belt in dusty conditions, maybe the factor is around 0.8 or 1.0. Wait, no, I think the factor is more like 1.0 for average conditions, but maybe higher for better conditions and lower for worse.

Wait, another approach: the horsepower that a belt can transmit is given by the product of the belt width, belt speed, and some factor. I found a formula once that says:

Horsepower = (Width in inches) × (Speed in feet per minute) × (0.023 * belt thickness correction factor) / (1 + tension ratio)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the standard formula is:

Horsepower = (P × v × K) / 1000,

where K is a factor based on belt type and service conditions.

Wait, maybe it's better to look up a standard table or formula. From what I recall, for flat belts, the horsepower per inch of width can vary based on the belt's material and construction. For example, a medium-duty double-ply belt might be rated for about 1.5 to 2.0 hp per inch of width per ply. But since this is double-ply, maybe it's 2.0 hp per inch.

So if the total horsepower is 25 hp, and per inch is 2 hp, then the width would be 25 / 2 = 12.5 inches. Hmm, but that seems quite wide, and the options don't go that high. The options are up to 8 inches.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the factors. Let me think again. Maybe the factor is per belt, not per inch. So the formula is:

Required width = (Horsepower × 50) / (Belt speed in feet per minute).

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the horsepower per inch is calculated using the belt speed.

Another approach: The horsepower a belt can transmit is given by:

Horsepower = (Width in inches) × (Belt speed in feet per minute) × (0.023) × (factor for service).

Where the factor for service is, say, 1.0 for average conditions. So, rearranging, Width = Horsepower / (0.023 × Belt speed × factor).

So, plugging the numbers: Horsepower is 25, belt speed is 5890 ft/min, factor is perhaps 1.0.

Width = 25 / (0.023 * 5890 * 1.0) 

Let me calculate the denominator: 0.023 * 5890 = approx 0.023 * 5890. 

0.023 * 5000 = 115, 0.023 * 890 = approx 20.47. So total is 135.47.

So Width = 25 / 135.47 ≈ 0.184 inches. That can't be right because none of the options are that small.

Wait, I must have the formula wrong. Maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the horsepower per inch based on belt speed.

I think another formula is:

Horsepower per inch = (Belt speed in feet per minute × 0.023 × service factor) / 100.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me try to find the correct approach.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options given. The options are from 4 inches up to 8 inches. So the correct answer is probably in that range.

Another approach: I remember that for a given diameter, the belt width can be determined based on the power and the pulley size. For a 15-inch diameter pulley, the standard belt widths might be around 5 to 7 inches for medium-duty applications.

Wait, but how to calculate it more accurately?

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

Belt width (inches) = (Horsepower × 1000) / (Belt speed in feet per minute × K)

Where K is a constant that depends on the belt type. For a double-ply belt, K might be around 50.

So, let's try that. Horsepower is 25, Belt speed is 5890 ft/min. K is 50.

Belt width = (25 × 1000) / (5890 × 50) 

Calculate numerator: 25000

Denominator: 5890 * 50 = 294500

So, 25000 / 294500 ≈ 0.0848 inches. That's way too small. So I must be using the wrong formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Horsepower = (Belt width in inches) × (Belt speed in feet per minute) × (0.023) × (service factor)

So, solving for belt width:

Belt width = Horsepower / (0.023 × Belt speed × service factor)

So, plugging in:

Horsepower =25, belt speed=5890, service factor. What's the service factor?

Wait, service factors account for conditions like dusty environments. I think a dusty environment might require a service factor of 1.5 or higher. Let's say 1.5.

So,

Belt width = 25 / (0.023 * 5890 * 1.5 )

Compute denominator:

0.023 *5890 = approx 135.47

135.47 *1.5 = 203.2

So, 25 / 203.2 ≈ 0.123 inches. Still way too small. This can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

Horsepower = (Belt width in inches) * (Belt speed in feet per minute) * (0.023) * (1 + service factor)

Wait, that doesn't seem right either.

Another thought: Maybe the correct approach is to use the formula for power transmitted by a belt, which is P = (T * v) / 550, where T is the belt tension in pounds and v is the belt speed in feet per minute.

But I don't know the tension here. Alternatively, perhaps the belt width is determined by some standard table based on horsepower and pulley diameter.

Wait, I think I remember that for V-belts, the selection is based on the horsepower and the pulley diameter, but since this is a flat belt, perhaps the approach is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the width can be determined using a table that relates horsepower, belt speed, and width. For example, a medium double-ply belt might have a certain rating.

Wait, perhaps the belt width for a given horsepower and pulley diameter can be found using this formula: W = (HP * 3.1416) / (d * rpm * factor)

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look for a rule of thumb for flat belts.

In some references, for flat belts, the width can be determined using the formula:

Width (inches) = (HP * 1000) / (Belt speed in feet per minute * K)

Where K is 50 for single-ply and 100 for double-ply belts.

Wait, let me try that. K for double-ply is 100.

So, width = (25 * 1000) / (5890 * 100) = 25000 / 589000 ≈ 0.0424 inches. That's still way too small.

Wait, perhaps K is per inch. Maybe I have the formula inverted.

Another approach: I've heard that for flat belts, the horsepower per inch of width can be calculated using the formula (0.5 to 1.0 hp per inch) for double-ply belts, depending on the conditions. 

So, in a dusty environment, maybe the factor is lower, so 0.75 hp per inch. Then, the required width would be 25 / 0.75 ≈ 33.33 inches, which is way too large. That can't be right either.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula uses the belt's linear speed. Maybe the horsepower per inch is based on the belt speed in feet per minute.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the options. The options are all between 4 and 8 inches. Considering the pulley is 15 inches, a 5-inch belt seems reasonable, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard that for a 15-inch pulley and 25 hp, the belt width is around 5 inches. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The belt length can be calculated, but the question is about width, not length. So maybe the width is determined by the power and the pulley diameter.

I think I'm not getting anywhere. Perhaps I should make an educated guess. Given the options, I think the correct answer is 5 inches, which is option A or E. Wait, looking at the options:

A:5, B:5.5, E:5.75, G:6, etc.

I think for a medium double-ply, 5 inches might be standard. So I'll go with option A:5 in belt.

To determine the width of the belt, the problem involves a medium double-ply flat leather belt on a 15-inch diameter pulley, driven by a 25 hp motor operating at 1500 rpm in a dusty environment. The belt width depends on factors such as power, speed, and service conditions.

First, the belt speed was calculated in feet per minute (fpm) using the formula:

\[
\text{Belt speed} = \frac{\pi \cdot \text{diameter} \cdot \text{rpm}}{12}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Belt speed} = \frac{\pi \cdot 15 \cdot 1500}{12} \approx 5890 \, \text{fpm}.
\]

Next, the horsepower per inch of belt width was considered. For a medium double-ply belt, the rating is typically around 1.5 to 2.0 hp per inch, depending on the service conditions. In a dusty environment, the service factor might reduce the effective rating.

Using the formula for horsepower transmitted by a belt:

\[
\text{Horsepower} = (\text{Belt width in inches}) \cdot (\text{Belt speed in fpm}) \cdot (0.023) \cdot (\text{service factor}),
\]

and rearranging to solve for belt width:

\[
\text{Belt width} = \frac{\text{Horsepower}}{0.023 \cdot \text{Belt speed} \cdot \text{service factor}}.
\]

Assuming a service factor of 1.5 for dusty conditions:

\[
\text{Belt width} = \frac{25}{0.023 \cdot 5890 \cdot 1.5} \approx 0.123 \, \text{inches}.
\]

This result was inconsistent with the given options, suggesting a potential error in the formula or assumptions. Instead, a rule of thumb for flat belts was applied, where the horsepower per inch of width for a double-ply belt is approximately 1.5 to 2.0 hp per inch. Given the total horsepower (25 hp), the required width would be:

\[
\text{Width} = \frac{25}{1.5} \approx 16.67 \, \text{inches}.
\]

This was also inconsistent with the options, indicating a need to reconsider. Finally, based on standard practices and the options provided, a 5-inch belt (option A) was selected as the most reasonable choice for a medium double-ply belt under the given conditions.
