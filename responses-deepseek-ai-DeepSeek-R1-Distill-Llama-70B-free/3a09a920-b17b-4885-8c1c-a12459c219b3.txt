Okay, I have to solve this accounting problem. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about a company's accounts receivable and average collection period over two fiscal years. Then, I need to calculate the cost or saving from extending or reducing the credit period. 

First, let's break down the information given.

At the beginning of 19X1, accounts receivable (AR) was $28,000. At the end of 19X1, AR was $32,000. Sales for 19X1 were $850,000. Then, in 19X2, end of year AR was $35,000, and sales were $920,000.

The desired rate of return is 10%, and the year is 360 days. 

The problem has two parts, a and b. Part a is to find the average collection period for each year. Part b is to find the cost or saving from extending or reducing the credit period.

Starting with part a: average collection period.

I remember that the average collection period is calculated as the number of days it takes to collect accounts receivable on average. The formula is:

Average Collection Period (ACP) = (Accounts Receivable) / (Average Daily Sales)

Or sometimes, it's calculated as (AR / Total Sales) * 360 days.

Wait, let me get that right. I think the correct formula is:

ACP = (Accounts Receivable / Credit Sales) * 360

But wait, another approach is to compute the average accounts receivable for the period and divide by the average daily sales. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula where you take net credit sales and divide by the average accounts receivable.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The average collection period is usually calculated as:

ACP = (Average Accounts Receivable) / (Total Credit Sales / 360)

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct formula. Oh right, the formula is:

Average Collection Period = (Accounts Receivable / Credit Sales) * 360

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because that would give a number larger than 360. Maybe it's:

ACP = (Accounts Receivable * 360) / Credit Sales

Yes, that makes sense. So for each year, I can compute ACP by taking the ending AR, multiply by 360, and divide by the annual credit sales.

Wait, but wait, average accounts receivable is usually the average of the beginning and ending AR for the period. Oh, because the AR changes over the year. So maybe the correct formula is:

ACP = (Average AR) * 360 / Total Sales

Where Average AR is (beginning AR + ending AR)/2.

Wait, for 19X1, beginning AR is 28,000 and ending is 32,000. So average is (28,000 + 32,000)/2 = 30,000.

Then, ACP 19X1 = (30,000 * 360) / 850,000

Similarly for 19X2: the beginning AR would be the ending AR of 19X1, which is 32,000, and ending AR is 35,000.

So average AR for 19X2 is (32,000 + 35,000)/2 = 33,500.

Then, ACP 19X2 = (33,500 * 360) / 920,000

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The average accounts receivable over the year would be the average of the start and end balances. That seems right because AR fluctuates throughout the year, so taking an average makes sense.

So let me calculate ACP for 19X1 first.

19X1:
Average AR = (28,000 + 32,000)/2 = 30,000
Sales = 850,000

ACP = (30,000 * 360) / 850,000

Let me compute that.

30,000 * 360 = 10,800,000

Divide by 850,000: 10,800,000 / 850,000 = 12.70588... days.

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait 850,000 * 12 = 10,200,000. 10,800,000 - 10,200,000 = 600,000. 600,000 /850,000 is about 0.70588. So 12.70588 days, approximately 12.71 days.

Hmm, let's see the options. Let me check the options for part a.

Looking at the options, for 19X1, the first number varies between 10 to 15 days.

Wait, let's compute this accurately.

30,000 * 360 = 10,800,000

Divide by 850,000: 10,800,000 / 850,000 = 12.70588 days.

So approximately 12.71 days for 19X1.

Now for 19X2.

Average AR is (32,000 +35,000)/2 =33,500

Sales in 19X2 are 920,000.

ACP = (33,500 *360)/920,000

Compute 33,500 *360 = 12,060,000

Divide by 920,000: 12,060,000 /920,000 =13.13043 days.

So approximately 13.13 days.

Wait, so for 19X1: ~12.71 days, 19X2: ~13.13 days.

Looking at the options:

Option E: 12.2 days, 12.9 days, $4.15.

Option H: 12.7 days, 13.11 days, $4.45.

Option D: 11.9 days, 12.8 days, $3.98.

Wait, I'm getting 12.71 days for 19X1 and 13.13 for 19X2. So looking for 19X1 first number around 12.7, second around 13.13.

Looking at option H: 12.7 days and 13.11 days. That's very close to my calculations. So that's probably part a.

But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check my calculation for 19X1 again.

19X1:

(28,000 +32,000)/2 = 30,000.

30,000 *360 =10,800,000.

Divide by 850,000: 12.70588 days, which is about 12.71 days. So option H's first is 12.7, which matches.

For 19X2, (32,000 +35,000)/2 =33,500.

33,500 *360 =12,060,000.

Divide by 920,000: 13.13043, which is approximately 13.13 days. Option H's second is 13.11, which is close, maybe due to rounding.

So part a's answers are approximately 12.7 and 13.13 days.

Now moving to part b: the cost or saving from extending or reducing the credit period.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this part. I think it involves the change in accounts receivable and the cost of capital.

The idea is that when a company extends its credit period, it's effectively giving customers more time to pay. This can increase accounts receivable because more customers are taking longer to pay, which ties up more cash in receivables. The cost is the opportunity cost of having that cash tied up, which is the company's desired rate of return.

So the cost is calculated based on the change in accounts receivable between the two periods.

Wait, but the question says "the cost (or saving) in extending (or reducing) the credit period during the two periods." So perhaps we're looking at the incremental investment in accounts receivable from 19X1 to 19X2, and then applying the cost of capital to that.

From 19X1 end to 19X2 end, accounts receivable increased from 32,000 to 35,000. So the increase is 3,000.

The cost is (increase in AR) * desired rate of return.

So 3,000 *10% = 300.

Wait, but let me think. The company's average collection period increased from ~12.7 days to ~13.13 days. So the credit period was extended, leading to higher AR and thus a cost.

But the question is asking for the cost of extending (if extended) or saving from reducing (if reduced) the credit period during the two periods. So in this case, since the credit period was extended (as ACP increased), there's a cost.

The cost would be the additional investment in AR times the desired rate.

So let's compute the change in AR from the end of 19X1 to the end of 19X2: 35,000 -32,000=3,000.

But wait, the average AR for the period is (32k +35k)/2=33.5k. But compared to the previous year, the average AR increased. Alternatively, perhaps the relevant figure is the increase in AR from one year's end to the next.

Wait, maybe another approach: the cost is based on the change in AR from 19X1 to 19X2.

Wait, at the end of 19X1, AR was 32k. At end of 19X2, AR was 35k. So the increase is 3k.

So the company has 3k more tied up in AR, which could have been invested elsewhere. The cost is 10% of that 3k, which is 0.1 *3,000 = 300. But the options are in the range of $3.50 to $7.26.

Wait, that can't be right because 300 is way larger than any of the options. Hmm, I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the change in accounts receivable over both years and find the incremental investment, then apply the cost.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the change in the average collection period leading to an increase in AR, and the cost is the difference in the AR multiplied by the cost of capital.

Wait, but maybe the cost is computed as the difference in the AR balance multiplied by the desired rate.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the cost of extending the credit period is:

Cost = (Change in Accounts Receivable) × (Desired Rate of Return)

So in this case, the change is 3,000 (from 32k to 35k). So 3,000 × 10% = 300. But that's $300, which is not among the options. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the change is in the average accounts receivable, not the ending balance. Because the average AR for 19X1 was 30k, and for 19X2 it was 33.5k. The change is 3.5k. So 3,500 ×10% = 350. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps the calculation is based on the difference in the average collection period multiplied by the sales and the desired rate.

Wait, another approach: the cost is the additional amount tied up in AR times the cost of capital. The additional amount is the increase in AR from 19X1 to 19X2.

Wait, but perhaps the correct way is to compute the additional days in ACP and then find the incremental investment.

The ACP increased by approximately 0.43 days (from 12.71 to 13.13). So 0.43 days extra.

So the incremental investment in AR would be (0.43 / 360) × Sales in 19X2.

Wait, because each day corresponds to a portion of annual sales being tied up in AR.

So for 19X2, the additional days are approx 0.43. So the additional AR is (0.43/360) × 920,000 = (0.43 ×920,000)/360

Let me compute that: 0.43 ×920,000 = 395,600. Divide by 360: ~1,099.44.

So approximately $1,099.44 tied up additionally. Then the cost is 10% of that: 0.1 ×1099.44 ≈ $109.94. But again, the options are much lower.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Let me think differently.

The average collection period increased by about 0.43 days between the two years. So the company is taking 0.43 more days to collect. To find the cost, we can compute the additional investment in AR due to this delay.

The additional investment is (Change in ACP / 360) × Sales in 19X2.

So (0.43 / 360) ×920,000 ≈ (0.43 *920,000)/360 ≈ (395,600)/360 ≈ 1,099.44.

Then, the cost is 10% of that: 1,099.44 ×0.10 = 109.94, which is about $110. But none of the options are near this.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate it differently. Maybe the cost is based on the change in AR from the previous year's end to the current year's end, multiplied by the cost of capital.

So from 19X1's end (32k) to 19X2's end (35k), the increase is 3k. So 3k ×10% = 300. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the difference in average AR multiplied by the rate. The average AR in 19X1 was 30k, and in 19X2 33.5k, so a 3.5k increase. 3.5k ×10% = 350. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step. Maybe the cost is calculated based on the change in ACP in terms of days multiplied by the average daily sales in 19X2 and then multiplied by the rate.

Wait, let's compute the average daily sales for 19X2. 920,000 / 360 ≈ 2,555.56 per day.

The ACP increased by 13.13 -12.71 = 0.42 days.

So additional AR tied up is 0.42 days × 2,555.56 ≈ 1,073.35.

Then the cost is 10% of that: 107.33.

Still not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the change in the AR balance, but considering the entire period. Maybe it's the difference in the AR between the two years' ends.

Wait, the change is 3,000 (from 32k to 35k). So the company has an additional 3k invested. The cost is 3k ×10% = 300.

But the options are much lower. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, looking back: part (b) says find the cost (or saving) in extending (or reducing) the credit period during the two periods.

Wait, perhaps for each year, we compute the cost, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the cost is calculated based on the change in accounts receivable between the two years, which is 3k, and then multiplied by the cost of capital.

But 3k ×10% is 300, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, maybe the cost is computed as the difference in the AR multiplied by the rate, but perhaps it's the difference from one year to the next, but that's still 300.

Wait, perhaps the desired rate is applied on a daily basis. Let me think. The rate is 10% per year, so daily it's 10% /360 ≈ 0.027778% per day.

The additional AR is 3k. So the cost is 3,000 × (10%/360) × number of days the money is tied up. But that doesn't make much sense because the period is annual.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about another approach.

The cost of extending the credit period is the additional amount invested in AR times the opportunity cost (10%).

So, the additional AR is 35,000 -32,000=3,000.

So, the cost is 3,000 ×10% × (time). Wait, but the time is one year, so 3,000 ×10% =300.

But this isn't matching any options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the change isn't just the end balances, but also considering the average AR for each year.

Wait, the average AR for 19X1 was 30k, and for 19X2 33.5k. So the increase is 3.5k. The cost is 3.5k ×10% =350.

Still not matching.

Wait, looking at the options, the only one close to my part a is option H, which has 12.7 and 13.11 days, and cost $4.45.

But how do I get $4.45?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the average AR for each year. Let me double-check.

For 19X1:

Beginning AR:28k, ending:32k.

Average AR= (28+32)/2=30k.

Correct.

19X2:

Beginning AR:32k (end of 19X1), ending 35k.

Average AR: (32+35)/2=33.5k.

Correct.

So for part a, I calculate 12.71 and 13.13 days.

Now, the cost: perhaps the change in the average AR is 3.5k. At 10%, that's 350. Hmm, but that's way higher than the options.

Wait, maybe the cost is based on the change in the number of days multiplied by the daily sales and then the rate.

Wait, the change in ACP is 0.42 days.

Each day's sales are 920,000 /360 ≈2,555.56.

So 0.42 ×2,555.56 ≈1,073.35.

Then, the cost is 10% of that:107.33.

But that's about $107, not matching options.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the cost for each year, but not the change. Maybe compute the cost for each year's ACP and find the difference.

Wait, no, because the question says the cost (or saving) in extending (or reducing) the credit period during the two periods, which implies the difference between the two periods.

Alternatively, perhaps the cost is computed as (average AR in 19X2 - average AR in 19X1) × desired rate.

So, 33.5k -30k=3.5k. 3.5k ×10% = 350.

But again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong numbers. Let me re-examine the question.

Wait, the problem says "using a 360 day year and given that Company X's desired rate of return is 10%
