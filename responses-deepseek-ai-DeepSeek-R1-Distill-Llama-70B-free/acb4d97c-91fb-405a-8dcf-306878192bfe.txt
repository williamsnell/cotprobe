Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about group theory, specifically about the external direct product of groups. I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The question has two statements. Statement 1 says that the external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic. Statement 2 claims that the external direct product of D3 and D4 is isomorphic to D12.

First, I'll tackle Statement 1. I remember that a cyclic group is one that can be generated by a single element. The external direct product (which I think is the same as the direct product) of two groups G and H, denoted G × H, consists of ordered pairs (g, h) where the group operation is component-wise.

Now, if both G and H are cyclic, say G is of order m and H is of order n, then G × H is cyclic if and only if m and n are coprime. Because if m and n are coprime, the orders of elements in the direct product will be the least common multiple of m and n, which is mn when they are coprime. So the direct product would be cyclic of order mn.

But wait, Statement 1 says that the external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic. That's not always true. For example, if I take two cyclic groups of the same order, like Z2 × Z2, which is the Klein four-group. That's not cyclic because all elements have order 2, so there's no element of order 4. Therefore, Statement 1 is only true when the orders of the cyclic groups are coprime. So Statement 1 is false in general.

Now, Statement 2: The external direct product of D3 and D4 is isomorphic to D12. Dn is the dihedral group of order 2n, representing the symmetries of a regular n-gon. So D3 has order 6, D4 has order 8. Their direct product would have order 6*8=48. But D12 has order 24, right? Because Dn has 2n elements, so D12 has 24 elements. So the direct product D3 × D4 has 48 elements, which is double the size of D12. Therefore, they can't be isomorphic because their orders are different. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing something up. Let me double-check. D3 is of order 6, D4 is order 8. Their direct product would have order 6×8=48. D12 has order 24. So no, they're not isomorphic because the sizes don't match. So Statement 2 is false.

So both statements are false. But wait, let me make sure about Statement 1. Oh right, Statement 1 says that the external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic. As I thought earlier, this is only true when their orders are coprime. So in general, it's not always true. So Statement 1 is false.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option I says both are false. Option J says both are false, but Statement 2 is occasionally true. But in this case, Statement 2 is specifically about D3 and D4. So the direct product is definitely not D12 because the order is wrong. So Statement 2 is false.

So both statements are false. Looking at the options, option I is False, False. So the answer should be I.

Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake. Is there any way that D3 × D4 could be isomorphic to D12? I don't think so. Because D3 × D4 would have elements that are combinations of symmetries from both groups, but D12 is a single dihedral group. Also, the orders don't match. So no, Statement 2 is definitely false.

So the correct answer should be I: False, False.

Statement 1 claims that the external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic. However, this is only true when the orders of the cyclic groups are coprime. For example, the direct product of two cyclic groups of the same order, such as \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \), results in the Klein four-group, which is not cyclic. Therefore, Statement 1 is false in general.

Statement 2 asserts that the external direct product of \( D_3 \) and \( D_4 \) is isomorphic to \( D_{12} \). \( D_3 \) has order 6, \( D_4 \) has order 8, and their direct product \( D_3 \times D_4 \) has order \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \). On the other hand, \( D_{12} \) has order 24. Since the orders of these groups differ, they cannot be isomorphic. Thus, Statement 2 is also false.

Both statements are false. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

I: False, False.
