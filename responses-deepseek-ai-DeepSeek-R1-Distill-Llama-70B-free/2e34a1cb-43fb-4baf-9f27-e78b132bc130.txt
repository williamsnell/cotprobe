Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the equilibrium constant for the dissociation of sodium at 298 K. The reaction is Na₂(g) ⇌ 2 Na(g). Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium constant K is related to the Gibbs free energy change, which in turn is connected to the enthalpy and entropy changes. But wait, there's more data given here, like the dissociation energy and some spectroscopic constants. I think I might need to use the Arrhenius equation or maybe something from statistical thermodynamics.

Let me jot down the given data. The dissociation energy is 70.4 kJ/mol. Oh wait, but wait, in thermochemistry, the dissociation energy is the energy required to break the bond, right? So that's the ΔH for the reaction. But wait, the reaction here is the dissociation of Na₂ into two Na atoms. So for the reaction as written, the ΔH would be +70.4 kJ/mol. Because breaking bonds is endothermic.

Wait, but wait, I remember that sometimes dissociation energy is given as D₀, the spectroscopic dissociation energy. So that's the energy from the bottom of the potential well to the dissociated atoms. Which would be the same as the enthalpy change at 0 K. So to get ΔH at 298 K, I might need to consider the heat capacities, but I don't have those values here. Maybe I can approximate ΔH as roughly equal to D₀, especially if the temperature isn't too high and the heat capacity change is small. So I'll proceed with ΔH ≈ 70,400 J/mol.

Next, the equilibrium constant K is related to the standard Gibbs free energy change by the equation:

ΔG° = -RT ln K

But to find ΔG°, I need ΔH° and ΔS°. So ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°. So I need to calculate the entropy change for the reaction.

The entropy change can be calculated using statistical mechanics, considering the changes in translational, rotational, and vibrational entropy. But wait, the problem gives some spectroscopic data: for Na₂, B is 0.155 cm⁻¹ and ν̃ is 159 cm⁻¹. B is the rotational constant, and ν̃ is the vibrational frequency. Also, the ground-state electronic degeneracy for Na is 2.

I think I should calculate the partition functions for Na₂ and Na, then find the changes in entropy from those. The entropy change ΔS° will be S°(products) - S°(reactants).

The reaction is Na₂(g) → 2 Na(g). So the reactant is one mole of Na₂, and the products are two moles of Na.

The total entropy change would be 2 S°(Na) - S°(Na₂).

But wait, each Na atom has its own entropy. Also, I need to consider the translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions. However, for monatomic gases like Na, the vibrational and rotational contributions are negligible compared to translational. Wait, no, Na is diatomic in Na₂, so in Na₂ there are rotational and vibrational modes, but Na is a monatomic gas, so it only has translational entropy.

So for Na₂, the entropy includes translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions. For Na (as a monatomic gas), only translational.

So, to compute the entropy of Na₂ and Na, I can use the Satterfield approach, but perhaps a simpler method is to calculate the standard molar entropy using the partition functions.

Wait, the formula for the entropy is S = R ln q + (U - TS)/T, but perhaps I should recall the formula for the standard molar entropy using the translational, rotational, and vibrational partition functions.

Alternatively, the entropy can be calculated using the equation:

S° = R ln(q_trans * q_rot * q_vib) + U/T - (other terms?)

Wait, perhaps I should remember the expressions for each contribution.

For a diatomic gas like Na₂:

- Translational partition function: q_trans = (2πmkT/(h²))^(3/2) (VT)^(1/3) )? Wait, actually, the translational partition function is given by q_trans = ( (2 π m k T )^(3/2) ) / h^3 ) * V.

But since we're dealing with standard states (1 bar pressure), the volume is RT/P. Wait, but for the standard molar entropy, the pressure is 1 bar, so V = RT/(P), where P is 1 bar.

So for the translational partition function q_trans for diatomic Na₂ would be:

q_trans = ( (2 π m (Na₂) k T )^(3/2) ) / h^3 ) * (V)

But since V for standard state is RT/(P), and P is 1 bar = 10^5 Pa.

Wait, but I think I'm complicating things. Maybe it's better to use the standard formulas for the entropy contributions.

Wait, I remember that for a diatomic molecule, the standard molar entropy can be calculated using:

S° = R ln( q_trans * q_rot * q_vib ) + ( (5/2) R + R ) 

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the entropy is calculated using the translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions, each expressed in terms of their respective partition functions.

Let me first find the translational entropy for Na₂. The translational partition function q_trans is given by:

q_trans = ( (2 π m k T )^(3/2) ) / h^3 ) * V

But at standard conditions, V = RT/(P), and since P = 1 bar = 10^5 Pa, V = (8.314 J/mol·K * T) / (1e5 Pa). Wait, but wait, in m³ units.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the translational entropy:

S_trans = R [ (3/2) ln( (2 π m k T ) / h² ) + ln(V) + (3/2) ]

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the Strans formula as:

S_trans = R ln [ (2 π m k T)^(3/2) / (h^3 P) )^(1/3) ) ] + (5/2 R)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think differently. The standard molar entropy can be found using the relations:

For translational: S_trans = R ln( (2 π m k T )^(3/2) / (h^3 P) )^(1/3) ) + (5/2 R )

Wait, no, maybe using the formula:

S_trans = R ln [ ( (2 π m k T )^(3/2) ) / (h^3 n^0 ) ) ] + (5/2) R T

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a standard formula or approach for this.

Alternatively, I recall that for diatomic molecules, the standard molar entropy is given by:

S° = S_translational + S_rotational + S_vibrational

Each of these can be calculated using their respective partition functions.

First, the translational entropy. The translational partition function for a diatomic molecule is:

q_trans = (2 π m k T / h² )^(3/2) * V

But since at standard conditions (P = 1 bar), V = RT/(P) = (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K)^-1 * T in K? Wait, no, 1 bar is approximately 0.9869 atm, so V = (8.314 J/mol·K * T) / (1e5 Pa). Wait, but perhaps I should express V in terms of cubic meters.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the entropy contributions in terms of known constants.

Wait, let me think about the vibrational contribution first. The vibrational partition function is given by:

q_vib = 1 / (1 - exp(- h c ν̃ / (k T) )) )

But for high temperatures, this can be approximated as (k T)/(h c ν̃ ). But given that ν̃ is 159 cm⁻¹, let me compute h c ν̃ to get the energy.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
ν̃ = 159 cm⁻¹ = 159 * 1e2 m⁻¹ = 1.59e4 m⁻¹
So h c ν̃ = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 * 1.59e4 = Let's compute this.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25
1.9878e-25 * 1.59e4 = approx 3.16e-21 J.

Now, k T at 298 K is 8.314 * 298 ≈ 2477 J/mol. Wait, but per molecule? No, wait, k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So k T = 1.38e-23 * 298 ≈ 4.11e-21 J per molecule.

So h c ν̃ ≈ 3.16e-21 J, and k T ≈4.11e-21 J.

So the ratio h c ν̃/(k T) = 3.16e-21 / 4.11e-21 ≈ 0.77. So the exponent is -0.77.

So q_vib ≈ 1 / (1 - exp(-0.77 )) ≈ 1/(1 - 0.46) ≈ 1.85.

Wait, but for a diatomic molecule, the vibrational modes are treated as quantized, and each vibrational mode contributes to the partition function. If the vibrational frequency is in the infrared, at room temperature, the vibrational modes might not contribute significantly, but in this case, ν̃ is 159 cm⁻¹. The energy spacing is h c ν̃ = ~3.16e-21 J. k T is ~4.11e-21 J, so the thermal energy is a bit higher than the vibrational energy spacing. So the approximation might not be too bad.

But the vibrational partition function is for each mode, but Na₂ is diatomic, so only one vibrational mode. So q_vib = 1/(1 - e^{-h c ν̃/(k T)}).

Alternatively, using the high-temperature approximation: q_vib ≈ k T/(h c ν̃) = (1.38e-23 * 298) / (6.626e-34 *3e8 *159e2 )

Wait, maybe I should compute this.

Wait, h c ν̃ is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 * 159e2 (since ν̃ is in cm⁻¹, which is 1e2 m⁻¹, so 159 cm⁻¹ =1.59e4 m⁻¹).

Wait, no, wait, ν̃ is 159 cm⁻¹, which is 159 * 1e2 m⁻¹, so 1.59e4 m⁻¹.

So h c ν̃ = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 *1.59e4.

Compute step by step:

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25

1.9878e-25 *1.59e4 = approx 3.16e-21 J.

k T per molecule is 1.38e-23 * 298 ≈4.11e-21 J.

So h c ν̃/(k T) = 3.16e-21 /4.11e-21 ≈0.77.

So exp(-0.77) ≈0.46.

So 1/(1 -0.46) ≈1.85.

So q_vib ≈1.85.

Then the vibrational entropy is S_vib = R [ ln q_vib - ( (h c ν̃)/(k T) ) * ( q_vib * e^{-h c ν̃/(k T)} ) / (1 - e^{-h c ν̃/(k T)} )) ) ]

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, using the formula:

S_vib = R [ ln q_vib + ( (h c ν̃)/(k T) ) * (1/(e^{(h c ν̃)/(k T)} -1 )) ) ]

Wait, but since q_vib is 1.85, and (h c ν̃)/(k T) is 0.77, let me compute this.

S_vib = R [ ln(1.85) + (0.77) * (1 / (e^{0.77} -1 )) ]

Compute each part:

ln(1.85) ≈0.615.

e^0.77 ≈2.15.

So 1/(2.15 -1 )=1/1.15≈0.8696.

So 0.77 *0.8696≈0.669.

So S_vib = R (0.615 +0.669 )= R *1.284 ≈8.314 *1.284≈10.68 J/mol·K.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the vibrational entropy per mole is S_vib = R [ ln q_vib + (θ_vib / T) * (1/(e^{θ_vib/T} -1 )) ) * (h c ν̃) / (k T) ) ]?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the vibrational entropy as:

S_vib = R [ x + (1/(e^x -1)) ] where x = h c ν̃/(k T )

Wait, x is 0.77 as calculated.

So S_vib = R [0.77 + (1/(e^{0.77} -1 )) ]

Compute 1/(e^0.77 -1 )= 1/(2.15 -1 )=1/1.15≈0.8696.

So 0.77 + 0.8696 = 1.6396.

So S_vib = 8.314 *1.6396≈13.65 J/mol·K.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about whether this is per mole or per molecule. Since in the formula, when you use q_vib per molecule, the entropy would be per mole.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the vibrational contribution as:

S_vib = R [ ln q_vib + ( (h c ν̃)/(k T) ) * (1/(e^{(h c ν̃)/(k T)} -1 )) ) ]

Which with the numbers we have, gives R*(0.615 + 0.77 * 0.8696) → as before.

Wait, but perhaps I should move on for now and see how the other contributions add up.

Next, the rotational contribution. The rotational constant B is given as 0.155 cm⁻¹. For a diatomic molecule, the rotational partition function is:

q_rot = (8 π² (k T)/(h c B ) )^(3/2) / σ

Where σ is the symmetry number. For Na₂, which is a homonuclear diatomic, σ=2.

Wait, so B is in cm⁻¹, so h c B would be in J.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c=3e8 m/s

B=0.155 cm⁻¹ =0.155 *1e2 m⁻¹=15.5 m⁻¹.

So h c B=6.626e-34 *3e8 *15.5 = Let's compute that.

6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

1.9878e-25 *15.5=3.082e-24 J.

k T at 298 K is 1.38e-23 *298≈4.11e-21 J.

So (k T)/(h c B )=4.11e-21 /3.082e-24 ≈1336.

So q_rot = (8 π² * 1336 )^(3/2) / 2.

Compute 8 π² ≈8*(9.8696)≈78.95.

78.95 *1336≈78.95 *1e3 *1.336≈105,600 approx? Wait, more accurately: 78.95 *1336= Let me compute 78.95 *1300=102,735; 78.95 *36=2,842.2 → total≈105,577.2.

So (105,577.2)^(3/2). Hmm. Let's compute the square root of 105,577 ≈325 (since 325^2=105,625). So (325)^3=34,328,125.

So (105,577)^(3/2)≈34,328,125.

Now, q_rot≈34,328,125 /2≈17,164,062.5.

So ln(q_rot)=ln(1.716e7)≈16.656.

So the rotational entropy is S_rot = R [ ln q_rot + 3/2 ].

Wait, no, wait. The rotational entropy is given by S_rot = R [ ln q_rot + (3/2) ]

Because the rotational energy is U_rot = (3/2) R T, so (U_rot)/(T) is (3/2) R.

Wait, no, the formula is S_rot = R ln q_rot + (U_rot/T )

But U_rot for rotational is (3/2) R T for linear molecules.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas. Let me think again. The entropy from rotation is:

S_rot = R ln q_rot + ( (dU_rot)/(dT) )_{V} )

But for rotational degrees of freedom, the energy is (3/2) R T, so dU/dT is (3/2) R.

So S_rot = R ln q_rot + (3/2) R.

So in this case, ln(q_rot)=16.656, so:

S_rot =8.314 *16.656 + (3/2)*8.314.

Compute each term:

8.314 *16.656≈138.5.

(3/2)*8.314≈12.47.

So S_rot≈138.5 +12.47≈150.97 J/mol·K.

Hmm, that's a significant contribution.

Now, the translational entropy for Na₂. The translational partition function is q_trans = ( (2 π m k T )^(
