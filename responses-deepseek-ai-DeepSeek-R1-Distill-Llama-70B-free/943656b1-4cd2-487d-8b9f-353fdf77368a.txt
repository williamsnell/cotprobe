Question:

A ceramics studio contracted with an artist to produce cups and saucers designed by the artist. The artist was an established designer of collectible ceramic dinnerware, and the studio did production work for many artists who created ceramic dinnerware. The price and quantity term of the contract read: "2,000 sets of the cups and saucers at $5 each, payable on delivery." The contract contained a merger clause. The studio produced the cups and saucers and delivered them along with a bill for $20,000 (4,000 pieces at $5 per piece). The artist refused to pay more than $10,000 (2,000 sets at $5 per set). At the trial of the studio's action against the artist for breach of contract, the studio introduced evidence of an established practice in the studio industry to price cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece, not a per-set, basis. Is the studio's evidence admissible?

Options:

A: No, because such evidence would vary an unambiguous term of the contract.
B: No, because the evidence would contradict the explicit terms of the contract.
C: Yes, because evidence of trade usage is always admissible.
D: Yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract.
E: No, because the contract contained a merger clause which makes extrinsic evidence inadmissible.
F: Yes, because the studio's interpretation of the contract aligns with the industry practice.
G: Yes, because the court should consider industry norms in interpreting the contract.
H: No, because the agreement was completely integrated.
I: No, because the artist was unaware of the industry practice.
J: Yes, because the evidence of established industry practice may explain the ambiguity in the contract.

Okay, I've got this contract law question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step.

So the scenario is about a ceramics studio and an artist. They have a contract where the studio is supposed to produce cups and saucers designed by the artist. The contract's payment terms say: "2,000 sets of the cups and saucers at $5 each, payable on delivery." Then, the studio delivers 4,000 pieces (which I assume is 2,000 sets, each set having a cup and a saucer, so 2 pieces per set) and bills $20,000. The artist only wants to pay $10,000, thinking it's $5 per set. The studio is suing for breach, and they're introducing evidence of an industry practice where pricing is done per piece, not per set.

The question is whether this evidence is admissible. The options are from A to J.

First, I remember that when interpreting contracts, courts look at the plain meaning of the terms. If the terms are unambiguous, extrinsic evidence (like industry practices) isn't allowed because the contract's language should be clear enough. But if there's ambiguity, extrinsic evidence can help clarify what the parties intended.

So the contract says "$5 each." The studio argues that "each" refers to each piece, meaning $5 per cup and $5 per saucer. The artist thinks "each" refers to each set, so $5 per set (cup and saucer together). 

Is "each" ambiguous here? Let's see. If a set is two pieces, and the contract says 2,000 sets at $5 each, it's a bit unclear whether "each" refers to each set or each piece. If it's per set, then 2,000 sets would mean $10,000 total. If it's per piece, 4,000 pieces would be $20,000.

So the term "each" could be interpreted in two ways, which creates an ambiguity. When there's an ambiguity, the court can consider extrinsic evidence, like trade usage, to determine the parties' intent.

I also recall the parol evidence rule. If the contract is fully integrated (which it is here because there's a merger clause), extrinsic evidence is generally not admissible to contradict the terms. However, if the terms are ambiguous, extrinsic evidence can be used to interpret them, not to contradict. 

Wait, the contract has a merger clause, which usually means that the written agreement is the final and complete expression of the parties' understanding, so prior agreements or negotiations can't be used to change it. But merger clauses don't necessarily bar the use of extrinsic evidence for interpreting ambiguous terms. They mainly prevent adding terms that aren't in the contract.

So in this case, since "each" is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence about industry practice is admissible to interpret what the parties intended. The studio's evidence of an established practice to price per piece would be relevant to show that both parties, being in the industry, would have understood "each" to mean per piece.

Looking at the options now:

Option A says no because it varies an unambiguous term. But if there's ambiguity, this doesn't apply. So A is incorrect.

Option B says no because it contradicts explicit terms. But the evidence is meant to interpret, not contradict. The contract doesn't explicitly say per piece or per set, so B might not be the right choice.

Option C says yes because trade usage is always admissible. That's not true; it's only admissible if the term is ambiguous. So C is incorrect.

Option D says yes because trade usage gives meaning. That makes sense because the contract is ambiguous, so usage can help interpret. D looks correct.

Option E says no because of the merger clause. But merger clauses don't bar extrinsic evidence for interpreting ambiguity, so E is wrong.

Option F says yes because the studio's interpretation aligns with industry practice. While that's true, the reason is more about the ambiguity and using trade usage to interpret. F is correct in result but maybe not the best reasoning.

Option G says yes because courts consider industry norms. That's a general statement, but it's correct in cases of ambiguity. So G is a possibility.

Option H says no because it's completely integrated. But again, complete integration (merger clause) doesn't bar evidence for interpreting ambiguity. H is incorrect.

Option I says no because the artist was unaware. But if the usage is well-established, the artist, as an established designer, should be deemed to know it. Plus, the question doesn't say the artist was unaware. So I is incorrect.

Option J says yes because the evidence explains the ambiguity. That aligns with what I was thinkingâ€”ambiguity allows for extrinsic evidence. So J is correct.

Wait, but D and J both seem correct. Let me think again. Option D says trade usage is offered to give meaning, which is correct. Option J says it may explain the ambiguity, which is also correct.

But looking back, the question is whether the evidence is admissible. The studio is offering the evidence to interpret the ambiguous term. So under the UCC (since this is a sale of goods, I think), trade usage is admissible to interpret contracts under UCC 2-202, even if the contract is fully integrated, as long as it's used to interpret, not to add terms.

So both D and J are possible. Hmm. But wait, the contract is for "sets" and says "each." If the industry practice is to price per piece, that would explain that "each" refers to each item in the set, not the set itself.

So the evidence is admissible to interpret the ambiguous term. So the correct answer would be either D or J.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: Yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract.

Option J: Yes, because the evidence... may explain the ambiguity in the contract.

Both seem correct, but in the context of the parol evidence rule, when a term is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence is admissible to interpret it. So J is correct because it's explaining the ambiguity.

Wait, but D says it's offered to give meaning, which is the same as explaining ambiguity. So perhaps both D and J are correct. But looking at the options, I think J is more precise because it's about the ambiguity.

Wait, but the question is about whether the evidence is admissible. So yes, it's admissible because the contract is ambiguous, and trade usage can be used to interpret it. So the answer is J.

Alternatively, the correct answer is D if it's about usage giving meaning, but I think J is better because it's about the ambiguity.

Wait, but the contract says "2,000 sets... at $5 each." So the question is whether "each" refers to each set or each item. The studio's industry practice is that it's per piece. So the contract's wording is ambiguous, and extrinsic evidence is allowed to interpret it.

So the answer should be J: Yes, because the evidence... may explain the ambiguity.

So looking back, the options are:

A: No, varies unambiguous term. Incorrect.

B: No, contradicts explicit. Incorrect.

C: Yes, always admissible. No.

D: Yes, to give meaning. Correct, but perhaps J is better.

E: No, merger clause. No.

F: Yes, aligns with practice. Correct, but maybe not the reason for admissibility.

G: Yes, consider norms. Correct, but same as F.

H: No, completely integrated. No.

I: No, artist unaware. No.

J: Yes, explains ambiguity. Best answer.

So the answer is J.

The question revolves around the admissibility of extrinsic evidence (industry practice) to interpret an ambiguous contract term. The contract states "2,000 sets of cups and saucers at $5 each," but it is unclear whether "each" refers to each set or each piece. The studio argues that "each" refers to each piece, based on an established industry practice of pricing per piece, while the artist interprets it as $5 per set.

Under contract law, if a term is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence, such as trade usage, is admissible to clarify the parties' intended meaning. The presence of a merger clause does not bar the use of extrinsic evidence for interpreting ambiguous terms; it only prevents adding terms not already in the contract. Here, the ambiguity of "each" makes extrinsic evidence admissible to resolve the interpretation.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, E, H, I**: Incorrect because they either misapply the parol evidence rule or ignore the ambiguity.
- **D, F, G, J**: Correct in principle, as they acknowledge the admissibility of extrinsic evidence to interpret the contract. However, **J** is the most precise because it directly addresses the role of extrinsic evidence in explaining the ambiguity.

Thus, the studio's evidence is admissible to interpret the ambiguous term "each," making **J** the best answer.

Answer: J
