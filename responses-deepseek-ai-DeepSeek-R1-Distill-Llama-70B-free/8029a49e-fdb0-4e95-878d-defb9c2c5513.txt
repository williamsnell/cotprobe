Okay, so I've got this problem here about burning hydrogen in air, and I'm supposed to find the percentage of theoretical air required. Hmm, I remember from my thermodynamics class that this involves some stoichiometry and maybe the concept of adiabatic processes. Let me try to work through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that hydrogen is burned with air at atmospheric pressure in an adiabatic burner, producing a flame temperature of 2000K. Both the hydrogen and air are supplied at 25°C, which is 298K. I need to find the percent theoretical air required for complete combustion.

First, I think I should write the combustion reaction for hydrogen. Hydrogen reacts with oxygen to form water. So the balanced equation is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. Wait, but air is mostly oxygen and nitrogen. So for each mole of O2, there are 3.76 moles of N2 in air. That's the standard approximation.

Theoretical air is the exact amount needed for complete combustion. So if I'm calculating the percent theoretical air, it's like how much more or less air is used compared to the theoretical amount. But in this case, since the flame temperature is higher than the initial temperature, I think more air is needed to lower the temperature. Or wait, no, if the process is adiabatic, the heat released by combustion raises the temperature. So maybe I need to find the actual air-fuel ratio that results in a certain adiabatic flame temperature.

Wait, the adiabatic flame temperature is the maximum possible temperature when all the heat is used to raise the temperature of the products. But in this case, the flame is at 2000K, which is lower than the adiabatic flame temperature of hydrogen, which I think is around 2400K. So that suggests that they're using more than the theoretical (stoichiometric) amount of air. Because adding more air (which has a high specific heat) would absorb more heat, thus lowering the flame temperature. So the percentage theoretical air would be higher than 100%—like maybe 200% or something.

So, the problem is about finding the air-fuel ratio such that the adiabatic combustion leads to 2000K. To approach this, I think I need to use energy balance. The heat released by the combustion of hydrogen at the initial temperature (25°C) goes into heating up the products (water vapor and nitrogen) to the final temperature (2000K).

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the stoichiometric (theoretical) air-fuel ratio.
2. Set up the energy balance equation considering the actual air used, which is a multiple of the theoretical amount.
3. Calculate the heat released and the heat absorbed by the products, considering the temperature change.
4. Solve for the unknown variable, which is the percent theoretical air.

Starting with the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. For the combustion of hydrogen:

The reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But air is 21% O2, 79% N2. So per mole of O2, there are 3.76 moles of N2.

So for each mole of H2, we need 0.5 moles of O2. But since air is 21% O2 by volume, the amount of air needed is (0.5 / 0.21) ≈ 2.38 times the moles of H2. So the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio by mole is AF_stoich = 2.38.

Wait, but I think AF ratio is usually expressed as mass of air per mass of fuel. So maybe I should calculate it in mass terms. Let me see: the molecular weight of H2 is 2 g/mol, O2 is 32 g/mol, N2 is 28 g/mol.

So per mole of H2, the moles of O2 needed is 0.5. The mass of O2 is 0.5 * 32 = 16 g. The mass of air is (0.5 + 3.76*0.5) * (molecular weights) — wait, no, that's not right. Wait, per mole of O2, 3.76 moles of N2. So for 0.5 moles O2, that's 0.5 * 3.76 = 1.88 moles N2.

So the total moles of air per mole H2 is 0.5 (O2) + 1.88 (N2) = 2.38 moles.

Mass of air is (0.5 *32) + (1.88 *28) = 16 + 52.64 = 68.64 g per mole H2.

Mass of H2 is 2 g per mole.

So the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (mass basis) is 68.64 g air / 2 g H2 = 34.32. So AF_stoich ≈ 34.32.

Wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. AF is usually expressed as mass of air per mass of fuel. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as the ratio in volume terms, but for combustion calculations, mass is more accurate because gases have varying densities.

But perhaps a more precise approach is to express everything in terms of moles, using the first law of thermodynamics.

So, let me consider the combustion of hydrogen. The general approach for adiabatic flame temperature is to perform an energy balance: the heat released by the reaction is absorbed by the products, raising their temperature.

But in this case, since it's an adiabatic burner, the heat of combustion is used to raise the temperature of the products. However, the actual situation might involve excess air, so the products include both water vapor, nitrogen, and excess oxygen if the air is more than stoichiometric.

So, the reaction with excess air would be:

H2 + (λ * (O2 + 3.76 N2)) → products.

Where λ is the factor for the air. For stoichiometric, λ=1. For excess air, λ>1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The stoichiometric air-fuel mixture has exactly the required O2. If more air is used (excess air), then λ would be the ratio of actual air to stoichiometric air. So if the percent theoretical air is, say, 200%, then λ is 2. So in the combustion equation, the air is multiplied by λ.

Wait, perhaps a clearer way is to write the combustion equation with a certain amount of air. Let me denote the hydrogen as 1 mole. Then, the stoichiometric O2 needed is 0.5 moles. So the stoichiometric air is 0.5 / 0.21 = 2.38 moles. But if we have excess air, the actual moles of air would be 2.38 * percent_theoretical_air / 100.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the combustion in terms of per mole of H2. So for 1 mole of H2:

Stoichiometric reaction: H2 + 0.5 O2 → H2O (but considering air, it's 0.5 O2 and 1.88 N2).

But with excess air, the O2 becomes 0.5 * (actual_air / stoich_air) ?

Hmm, maybe I should approach this using the first law. The energy released by combustion (enthalpy of reaction) is absorbed by the products, heating them up from initial temperature to 2000K.

Wait, but wait, hydrogen and air are supplied at 25°C, which is 298K. So the initial temperature of reactants is 298K, and the products are at 2000K.

But in an adiabatic process, the heat released by combustion (ΔH) is used to raise the temperature of the products. But wait, wait. The enthalpy of reaction is negative (exothermic), so the products' temperature increases.

But wait, the enthalpy change at standard conditions (25°C) is the heat of combustion. For hydrogen, the standard enthalpy of combustion is about -285,800 kJ/kmol (I might have to double-check this number, but it's something like that).

So the heat released is 285,800 kJ per kmol of H2 (since it's exothermic, it's a negative value, but I'm just considering magnitude here).

This heat is absorbed by the products, which are water vapor and nitrogen (and excess oxygen if there's excess air). So the heat absorbed is the sum of the heat needed to raise the temperature of each product from 298K to 2000K.

Wait, but wait, the products are H2O, N2, and possibly O2 if excess air is present. So the total heat absorbed would be the sum of the heat capacities of each product multiplied by the temperature change.

Wait, but in this case, the reaction is written as:

1 mol H2 + λ*(0.5 O2 + 1.88 N2) → products.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me define the combustion equation more precisely. Let me write it as:

H2 + λ*( (O2) + 3.76 N2 ) → ... 

Wait, but I think it's better to write the stoichiometric coefficients correctly. The stoichiometric amount of O2 needed per mole H2 is 0.5 moles. So in stoichiometric air, that's 0.5 moles O2 and 1.88 moles N2, for a total of 2.38 moles of air.

But if we have excess air, the amount of air is more. Let's denote the percent theoretical air as %TA. So the actual air is (100/%TA) times the stoichiometric air? Wait, no, wait. If %TA is 100%, then the air is exactly stoichiometric. If it's more than 100%, then there's excess air. So the actual moles of air would be (stoichiometric moles) * (%TA/100).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think: suppose stoichiometric air is 'a' moles. If I have 200% theoretical air, that's 2a moles. So the actual air supplied is 2a, which is twice the stoichiometric amount.

So in the combustion equation, it would be H2 + (λ * a) air → products, where λ is the factor. So for %TA of 200%, λ is 2.

Wait, so the general reaction is:

H2 + (λ * (0.5 O2 + 1.88 N2)) → products.

So, let me write that out:

1 H2 + λ*(0.5 O2 + 1.88 N2) → ?

Now, the products will include H2O, N2, and any excess O2. Let's balance the equation.

Hydrogen: 1 mole on the left, so 1 mole of H2O on the right.

Oxygen: λ*(0.5) moles O2 supplied. On the right, each H2O has O, and any excess O2.

So, let's calculate O atoms.

Left side O: λ*(0.5)*2 = λ moles O (since each O2 is 2 atoms, but in terms of moles, 0.5 O2 is 1 mole O, but wait, no. Let me think in terms of moles.

Wait, perhaps it's better to balance the equation properly.

The reaction is:

H2 + λ*(0.5 O2 + 1.88 N2) → H2O + N2 + O2 (if any).

So, let's count each element.

Hydrogen: 2 atoms in H2 → 2 atoms in H2O. So that's balanced.

Oxygen: On the left, λ*(0.5)*2 (since each O2 is 2 atoms) → λ*1 mole of O atoms. Wait, no, wait. Let's think in terms of moles of O2.

Wait, per mole of H2, the O2 supplied is λ * 0.5. Because stoichiometric is 0.5 O2, and actual is λ times that.

So, O2 supplied: 0.5 * λ moles.

Each H2O requires 0.5 moles O2 (since H2O has one O atom, which comes from 0.5 O2). So the O2 consumed is 0.5 moles.

Therefore, the O2 remaining is 0.5*(λ - 1) moles.

So, the products are:

- 1 mole H2O
- 1.88 * λ moles N2 (since N2 is supplied as 1.88 per stoich O2, and we have λ times the stoich O2)
- 0.5*(λ - 1) moles O2 (excess oxygen)

Wait, actually, the N2 comes in as 3.76 moles per mole O2. So per 0.5 moles O2 stoichiometric, N2 is 0.5*3.76 = 1.88 moles. So with λ, N2 becomes λ*1.88.

So the products are:

- H2O: 1 mole
- N2: 1.88 * λ moles
- O2: 0.5*(λ - 1) moles (if λ>1)

Now, the energy balance. The heat released by combustion is the enthalpy of reaction, which is negative (exothermic), but the products absorb this heat to raise their temperature.

The enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction at standard conditions (25°C) is the heat of combustion. For hydrogen, the lower heating value (LHV) is about 242,000 kJ/kg, but in molar terms, it's about 285,800 kJ/kmol (I might need to confirm this value, but I'll proceed with that for now).

Wait, wait, maybe I should be precise. The standard enthalpy of formation for H2O(l) is about -285,830 kJ/kmol, and for H2 and O2, it's zero (since they're elements in their standard state). So the enthalpy of combustion (ΔH) is the enthalpy of formation of H2O times 2 (since 2 moles of H2O are formed per 2 moles H2 burned—wait, in our reaction, it's 1 mole H2, so 1 mole H2O. So ΔH would be -285,830 kJ/kmol of H2 burned.

Wait, no. Let me correct. The reaction is 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, ΔH = -571,660 kJ/kmol of reaction (because 2 moles of H2O are formed, each with ΔHf of -285,830). So per mole of H2, ΔH is -285,830 kJ.

So, the heat released per mole of H2 burned is 285,830 kJ.

This heat is absorbed by the products (H2O, N2, O2) to raise their temperature from 298K to 2000K.

Now, the heat absorbed is calculated using the heat capacity at constant pressure (since pressure is constant in the burner) for each product, multiplied by the temperature change.

So, Q = sum (n_i * Cp,i * ΔT )

Where n_i is moles of each product, Cp,i is their molar heat capacity, and ΔT is (2000 - 298) = 1702 K.

So, the products are:

1 mole H2O(g)
1.88λ moles N2
0.5(λ-1) moles O2 (if λ>1)

Wait, but I'm not sure if the H2O is liquid or gas. At high temperatures like 2000K, it's definitely gas, so I should use the heat capacity of water vapor.

So, the heat capacities at constant pressure (Cp) for each gas are approximately:

H2O(g): ~33.1 J/mol·K (I think it's around 33-34)
N2: ~29.1 J/mol·K
O2: ~29.4 J/mol·K

But I might need to check more precise values. Alternatively, sometimes textbooks use average values, like 30 J/mol·K for diatomic gases and around 33 for water vapor. But to be accurate, let me look up the values.

Wait, I can't look them up, but I'll proceed with these approximate values.

So, for each product:

H2O: 33.1 J/mol·K
N2: 29.1 J/mol·K
O2: 29.4 J/mol·K

So, heat absorbed by H2O: 1 * 33.1 * 1702 = 33.1 * 1702 ≈ let's calculate that.

33 * 1700 is 56,100, so 33.1 * 1702 is about 56,300 J/mol.

Heat absorbed by N2: 1.88λ * 29.1 * 1702 ≈ 1.88*29.1*1702 * λ.

Similarly, heat absorbed by O2: 0.5(λ -1) *29.4 *1702.

So, the total heat absorbed (Q) is the sum of these three terms.

But wait, the heat released by combustion is 285,830,000 J per mole H2 (since 1 kJ is 1000 J, so 285830 kJ is 285,830,000 J).

So the energy balance equation is:

Heat released = Heat absorbed

285,830,000 J = [33.1 *1702 *1 + 29.1*1702*1.88λ + 29.4*1702*0.5(λ-1)] J

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, compute the constants:

ΔT = 2000 - 25 = 1975? Wait no, 2000 - 25 is 1975 K? Wait no, 2000K - 298K is 1702K.

Wait, yes, ΔT is 2000 - 298 = 1702 K.

So,

Heat from H2O: 33.1 * 1702 = let's compute that.

33.1 * 1700 = 33.1*1700 = 56,270. Then 33.1 *2 = 66.2, so total 56,270 +66.2= 56,336.2 J/mol.

Heat from N2: 29.1 *1702 = let's compute that.

29 *1700 = 49,300. 29 *2 =58 →
