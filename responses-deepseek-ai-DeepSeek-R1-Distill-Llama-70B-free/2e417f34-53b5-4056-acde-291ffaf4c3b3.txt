Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve these conversion problems. I've got three parts to do: a, b, and c. Let's take them one by one.

Starting with part (a): Convert 678 cm to feet. Hmm, I remember that the metric system uses centimeters and meters, and the imperial system uses feet and inches. So I need to convert cm to feet.

Wait, I think 1 meter is about 3.28084 feet. And since 1 meter is 100 cm, that means 1 cm is 0.01 meters. So, 678 cm is 6.78 meters. Right? Because 678 divided by 100 is 6.78.

So to convert meters to feet, I multiply by 3.28084. Let me calculate that. 6.78 * 3.28084. Let me do the math step by step. 

6 * 3.28084 is 19.68504, and 0.78 * 3.28084 is... Let's see, 0.7 is 2.3, so 0.7 * 3.28084 is around 2.296588. Wait, no, wait, 0.7 is 3.28084 *0.7 is 2.296588. Then 0.08 *3.28084 is 0.2624672. So adding those together: 2.296588 +0.2624672 is about 2.559055. So total is 19.68504 +2.559055 = 22.244095 feet.

Wait, but looking at the options, they seem to have whole numbers or maybe one decimal place. So 22.244 would round to about 22.24 feet, which is approximately 22 feet when rounded down. But let me double-check the calculation to be sure.

Wait another approach: Alternatively, 1 cm is 0.0328084 feet. So 678 cm * 0.0328084 ft/cm. Let me compute that. 678 * 0.0328084.

Let me break it down. 600 * 0.0328084 is 19.68504. 78 * 0.0328084. Let's compute 70 * 0.0328084 is 2.296588, and 8 *0.0328084 is 0.2624672. Adding those gives 2.296588 +0.2624672 = 2.5590552. So total is 19.68504 +2.5590552 = 22.2440952 feet. So yeah, 22.244 feet, which is about 22.24 feet. So in the options, it's probably 22 ft as the answer. Let me see the options.

Looking at the options, for part (a), the possible answers are:

A:21 ft

B:22 ft

C:19 ft

D:22 ft

E:24 ft

F:23 ft

G:20 ft

H:25 ft

I:20 ft

J:18 ft

So B and D have 22 ft for part (a). So that's a key point to narrow down the options.

Now part (b): Convert 316 liters to dry pints. Hmm, liters to pints. I'm a bit confused because I think there are liquid pints and dry pints, and the conversion factors are different. Oh wait, the question specifies dry pints, so I need to use the dry pint conversion.

I remember that 1 liter is approximately 2.2046227 pints, but wait, is that for liquid pints? Because dry pints might be different. Alternatively, maybe I should look up the exact conversion factor.

Wait, I think the US dry pint is defined as 1/20 of a US bushel. And 1 bushel is 2150.42 cubic inches. So 1 dry pint is 2150.42 /20 = 107.521 cubic inches.

Wait, but liters are in cubic decimeters. 1 liter is 1000 cubic centimeters, which is 0.001 cubic meters. Or, 1 liter is 61.02374 cubic inches because 1 cubic inch is about 16.3871 cm³. So 1000 /16.3871 ≈ 61.02374.

So 1 liter is approximately 61.02374 cubic inches. And 1 dry pint is 107.521 cubic inches. So to convert liters to dry pints, it would be liters * (61.02374 /107.521) dry pints per liter.

Let me compute that factor. 61.02374 /107.521 ≈ 0.5673. So 1 liter ≈ 0.5673 dry pints. So for 316 liters, it would be 316 * 0.5673.

Let me calculate that. 300 *0.5673 is 170.19. 16 *0.5673 is 9.0768. So total is 170.19 +9.0768 ≈ 179.2668 dry pints. Wait, that's about 179.27 dry pints.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options for part (b) are:

A:625 pints

B:575.12 pints

C:650 pints

D:668 pints

E:600 pints

F:560 pints

G:613 pints

H:580 pints

I:550 pints

J:590 pints

Wait, none of these are around 179. Hmm, that's confusing. Did I make a mistake in the conversion?

Wait another approach: Maybe I'm confusing liters with something else. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about converting liters to pints, but using a different conversion factor. Wait, maybe I should consider that 1 US liquid pint is 0.473176 liters, but dry pints are different.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look up the conversion factor from liters to dry pints. Let me think. I recall that 1 liter is approximately 2.20462 dry pints? No, wait, that can't be right because that would make 316 liters a much bigger number.

Wait, no, maybe I got it backward. Let me think again: 1 dry pint is equal to 0.554112 liters. So 1 liter is 1/0.554112 dry pints. So 1 liter ≈ 1.8047 dry pints.

Wait, that makes more sense. So if 1 dry pint is 0.554112 liters, then 1 liter is about 1.8047 dry pints. So 316 liters would be 316 * 1.8047 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 300 *1.8047 = 541.41, and 16 *1.8047 = 28.8752. So total is 541.41 +28.8752 = 570.2852 dry pints. So approximately 570.29 pints.

Looking at the options, part (b) options are B:575.12, D:668, F:560, etc. Hmm, 570 is closest to B's 575.12, but let me double-check the exact conversion factor.

Wait, perhaps I should find the exact conversion. Let me make it precise.

The exact conversion between liters and dry pints is as follows:

1 liter = 1000 cm³ = 1000 ml.

1 US dry pint is exactly 107.5211201 cubic inches.

1 cubic inch is approximately 16.3871 cm³.

So 1 dry pint = 107.5211201 *16.3871 cm³.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 1 inch is 2.54 cm, so 1 cubic inch is (2.54 cm)^3 = 16.3871 cm³.

So 1 dry pint = 107.5211201 *16.3871 cm³.

Let me compute that: 107.5211201 *16.3871.

Well, 100 *16.3871 is 1638.71, 7.5211 *16.3871 ≈ let's calculate 7 *16.3871=114.7097, and 0.5211*16.3871≈ 8.543. So total for 7.5211 is 114.7097 +8.543≈123.2527. So 1638.71 +123.2527≈1761.9627 cm³. So 1 dry pint is approximately 1761.9627 cm³.

Wait, but 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So 1 liter is 1000/1761.9627 dry pints. That's approximately 0.5673 dry pints per liter. Wait, so that's what I had earlier. So 316 liters *0.5673 dry pints/liter ≈ 179.2668 dry pints.

But that's way lower than any of the options given. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the conversion. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for liquid pints, not dry pints. Let me think: 1 liter is about 2.1134 liquid pints. So 316 *2.1134 ≈ 668 pints. Oh, wait, that's option D for part (b):668 pints. But the question says dry pints, not liquid. So this is confusing.

Wait, but perhaps I mixed up the factors. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the conversion factor from liters to dry pints. Let me think: 1 US dry pint is 0.550610471 liters. So 1 liter is 1/0.550610471 ≈1.815 dry pints. So 316 liters *1.815 ≈ ?

316 *1.8 = 568.8, and 316 *0.015=4.74. So total is 568.8+4.74=573.54 pints. That's about 573.5. Looking at the options, the closest is B:575.12. Hmm, but why is there a discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps using a more precise conversion factor. Let me compute 1 liter /0.550610471 liters per dry pint.

1 /0.550610471 = approximately 1.81606.

So 316 *1.81606 = let's compute 300 *1.81606=544.818, and 16 *1.81606=29.057, so total is 544.818 +29.057=573.875. So approximately 573.88 dry pints.

Looking at the options, the closest is B:575.12. So perhaps that's the intended answer, considering some rounding.

Wait, but earlier I thought 1 liter is about 0.567 dry pints, leading to 179 pints, which doesn't match any options. But when I considered that 1 dry pint is 0.5506 liters, which makes 1 liter ≈1.816 dry pints, then 316 liters would be about 573.88 dry pints, which is near option B's 575.12.

So perhaps the correct answer for part (b) is around 575 pints, which is option B.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier approaches gave conflicting results. Maybe I should cross-check with exact definitions.

Another approach: 1 US dry pint is exactly 107.5211201 cubic inches.

1 liter is 61.02374 cubic inches.

So 1 liter = 61.02374 / 107.5211201 dry pints.

Which is approximately 0.5673 dry pints per liter.

So 316 liters would be 316 *0.5673 ≈179.27 dry pints.

But that doesn't match any option. So perhaps the question intended liquid pints instead of dry pints. Because 316 liters to liquid pints would be 316 * 2.11338 ≈668 pints, which is option D for part (b).

But the question says dry pints, so I'm stuck. Maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different system. Alternatively, perhaps I should use online conversion factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's check the options given. The only option where part (a) is 22 ft is B and D. So let's look at their part (b) and (c).

Option B: (a)22 ft, (b)575.12 pints, (c)110 pounds.

Option D: (a)22 ft, (b)668 pints, (c)150 pounds.

Now, for part (c): Convert 50 kg to pounds.

I know that 1 kg is approximately 2.20462 pounds. So 50 kg *2.20462 = 110.231 pounds. So approximately 110.23 pounds, which rounds to 110 pounds. So part (c) should be 110 pounds.

Looking at the options, which options have part (c) as 110 pounds? Option B does, and option G. Wait, let me check:

Option B: (c)110 pounds.

Option G: (c)111 pounds.

So for part (c), the correct answer is approximately 110 pounds. So option B and G have close values, but B is exactly 110.

So, for part (c), the correct answer is 110 pounds, so option B and possibly others have it.

Now, back to part (b). If part (c) is 110, then the only option that fits part (a) 22 ft and part (c) 110 is option B. So part (b) would be 575.12 pints.

But earlier calculation suggests that 316 liters is about 573.88 dry pints when using the 1 liter ≈1.816 dry pints factor. So 575 is close, and perhaps due to rounding, it's 575.12.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended approach was different. Maybe the question uses 1 liter = 2.2046 pints, but that doesn't make sense because that's for pounds to kg.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of gallons. Let me try another approach.

Wait, 1 US liquid pint is 0.473176 liters. So 1 liter is 1/0.473176 ≈2.11338 liquid pints. So 316 liters *2.11338 ≈668.07 liquid pints. But the question asks for dry pints, not liquid.

Wait, but 1 dry pint is larger than 1 liquid pint. Because dry pints are based on bushels, which are larger. Wait no, actually, no, a dry pint is smaller in volume than a liquid pint? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me think again. A US liquid pint is 28.875 cubic inches. A US dry pint is 33.955 cubic inches? No, wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think I mixed up the volumes. Let me clarify.

Actually, the US liquid pint is 28.875 cubic inches.

The US dry pint is 33.955 cubic inches.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, let me get accurate numbers.

From what I remember:

- 1 US liquid pint is exactly 28.875 cubic inches.

- 1 US dry pint is exactly 33.955 cubic inches. Wait, no, that can't be right because a dry pint is part of a bushel, which is larger.

Wait, perhaps better to look up the exact volumes.

Upon checking, 1 US liquid pint is 28.875 in³.

1 US dry pint is 33.9551 in³.

Wait, so a dry pint is larger than a liquid pint. So 1 liter is 61.02374 in³. So to find how many dry pints that is:

61.02374 in³ /33.9551 in³/dry pint ≈1.798 dry pints per liter.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 0.5673 dry pints per liter, which contradicts this. So I must have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I inverted the ratio. Let me recalculate.

If 1 dry pint is 33.9551 in³, then 1 liter (61.02374 in³) is 61.02374 /33.9551 ≈1.798 dry pints.

Wait, that makes more sense. So 1 liter ≈1.798 dry pints.

So 316 liters *1.798 dry pints/liter = ?

Let me compute that. 300 *1.798 =539.4, 16 *1.798=28.768. So total is 539.4 +28.768=568.168 dry pints. So approximately 568.17 pints.

Looking at the options, option B is 575.12, which is close. Perhaps due to rounding, it's 575.12.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact conversion factor is slightly different. Let me compute more accurately.

1 dry pint = 33.9550819 cubic inches.

1 liter = 61.02374 cubic inches.

So 61.02374 /33.9550819 = approx 1.7983.

So 316 *1.7983 = ?

Let me compute 316 *1.7983.

316 *1 =316.

316 *0.7=221.2

316 *0.09=28.44

316 *0.0083≈2.621

So adding: 316 +221.2 =537.2; 537.2+28.44=565.64; 565.64 +2.621≈568.261.

So approximately 568.26 dry pints.

But the option B says 575.12, which is a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps the exact conversion factor I'm using is off. Let me check the precise value.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise numbers. Let me compute 61.02374 /33.9550819 exactly.

Using a calculator: 61.02374 ÷33.9550819 ≈1.7983.

So 316 *1.7983 =568.2618.

So 568.26 pints. But the options don't have that. The closest is option B:575.12.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use 1 liter ≈1.816 dry pints, leading to 316*1.816=573.856 pints, which is 573.86, closer to 575.

Wait, perhaps the exact conversion is slightly different. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses an approximation of 1 liter =1.8 dry pints.

316 *1.8= 568.8. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, maybe the question made a mistake and used liquid pints instead. Because if we compute 316 liters in liquid pints, that's 316 *2.113
