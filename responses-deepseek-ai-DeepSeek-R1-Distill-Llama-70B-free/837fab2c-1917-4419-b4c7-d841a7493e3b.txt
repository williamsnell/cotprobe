Okay, so I've got this finance question here about calculating the Net Present Value (NPV) of an investment project. Hmm, I remember that NPV is important because it helps determine whether a project will generate profit or loss by considering the time value of money. So the basic idea is to sum the present values of all cash flows, both inflows and outflows.

The project costs $500 today. So that's a cash outflow right now. Then, it generates profits of $500 in year five and another $500 in year ten. The discount rate is 10%. I need to find the NPV.

Wait, so the formula for NPV is the sum of the present values of all cash flows. The initial investment is a negative value because it's a cost. The profits are positive cash inflows.

So, the initial investment is straightforward: -$500 today. No discounting needed because it's at time zero.

Now, the two $500 cash inflows happen in year 5 and year 10. I need to find the present value (PV) of each of these using the discount rate of 10%.

The present value formula is PV = Cash Flow / (1 + r)^t, where r is the discount rate and t is the time in years.

So for the first $500 at year 5:
PV1 = 500 / (1 + 0.10)^5

And for the second $500 at year 10:
PV2 = 500 / (1 + 0.10)^10

I think I should calculate each of these separately and then add them up, then subtract the initial investment to get the NPV.

Let me compute PV1 first. (1.10)^5 is... Let me calculate step by step. 1.1 to the 1st power is 1.1, 2nd is 1.21, 3rd is 1.331, 4th is 1.4641, and 5th is 1.61051. So PV1 is 500 divided by 1.61051. Let me compute that. 500 ÷ 1.61051 ≈ 500 / 1.61051 ≈ 310.23.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that division. So 1.61051 times 310 equals approximately 310 * 1.61 is 310 * 1.6 is 496, and 310 * 0.01 is 3.1, so about 499.1. So 1.61051 * 310 is roughly 500, so 500 / 1.61051 is approximately 310.23. So PV1 ≈ 310.23.

Now for PV2 at year 10. (1.1)^10, I remember that (1.1)^10 is approximately 2.5937. Let me confirm: 1.1^1=1.1, 2=1.21, 3=1.331, 4=1.4641, 5=1.61051, 6=1.771561, 7=1.9487171, 8=2.14358881, 9=2.357947691, 10=2.59374246. So yes, about 2.5937.

So PV2 = 500 / 2.5937 ≈ 500 / 2.5937 ≈ 192.45.

Wait, let me check that division. 2.5937 * 192 = let's see, 200 * 2.5937 is 518.74, so 192 is 8 less than 200. 8 * 2.5937 is 20.7496. So 518.74 - 20.7496 = 498. So 192 * 2.5937 ≈ 498. So 500 is a bit more, so approximately 192.45.

So the total present value of the inflows is PV1 + PV2 = 310.23 + 192.45 ≈ 502.68.

Then subtract the initial investment of $500. So NPV = 502.68 - 500 = 2.68. Hmm, that's approximately $2.68, which is a positive value.

But wait, looking at the options, I don't see $2.68. The closest options are J: $3, I: -$27, and others. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, maybe I should be more precise with the exponents. Let me recalculate the present values.

Calculating PV1: 500 / (1.1)^5.

1.1^5 is 1.61051, so 500 / 1.61051 = 310.23, correct.

PV2: 500 / (1.1)^10 = 500 / 2.59374246 ≈ 192.45.

So total PV of inflows is 310.23 + 192.45 = 502.68.

Subtract initial cost: 502.68 - 500 = 2.68. So about $2.68, which is approximately $3. So option J is $3. But wait, let me look again at the options:

Options are A: -$100, B: $500, C: -$500, D: -$3, E: $27, F: $100, G: -$30, H: $0, I: -$27, J: $3.

So J is $3, which would be the correct answer. But wait, perhaps the numbers are slightly different. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate (1.1)^5 more precisely. Let me compute 1.1^5 step by step:

1.1^1 = 1.1
1.1^2 = 1.21
1.1^3 = 1.331
1.1^4 = 1.4641
1.1^5 = 1.61051

Yes, that's correct.

So 500 / 1.61051 = 500 ÷ 1.61051. Let me compute this more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

1.61051 × 310 = 310 ×1.61051 = 310 ×1 =310, 310 ×0.61051= 310×0.6=186, 310×0.01051≈3.2561. So total ≈310+186+3.2561=499.2561. Close to 500. So 310 gives 499.2561. So 310.23 would give 500.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 500 /1.61051 precisely. Let me do this division.

1.61051 × 310 = 499.2561, as above. So 310 gives us 499.2561, which is 0.7439 less than 500. So to find the exact value, perhaps we can compute how much more.

The difference is 500 - 499.2561 = 0.7439. Since 1.61051 × x = 0.7439, so x = 0.7439 / 1.61051 ≈ 0.4617. So 310 + 0.4617 ≈ 310.4617. So PV1 ≈ 310.46.

Similarly, for PV2: 500 / (1.1)^10 = 500 / 2.59374246.

Compute 2.59374246 × 192 = let's see. 2 ×192=384, 0.59374246 ×192 ≈ 0.5*192=96, 0.09374246*192≈18 approx. So 96+18=114. So total 384+114≈498. So 192 gives 498, and the difference is 2. So 500 - 498=2. So how much more is needed beyond 192?

2 / 2.59374246 ≈ 0.771. So 192.771, so PV2 ≈ 192.77.

So total PV of inflows: 310.46 + 192.77 = 503.23.

Subtract the initial $500: 503.23-500=3.23. So NPV is approximately $3.23.

Looking at the options, J is $3, which is close. So the correct answer should be J: $3.

But wait, perhaps I should use the exact factors. Alternatively, maybe I can compute using the present value formula more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects using the present value factors rounded to three decimal places, which might give a slightly different result.

Wait, another approach: Let me calculate each present value more accurately using the formula.

For the first cash flow (Year 5):

PV1 = 500 / (1.10)^5
(1.10)^5 = 1.61051
So PV1 = 500 / 1.61051 ≈ 310.23.

For the second cash flow (Year 10):

PV2 = 500 / (1.10)^10 = 500 / 2.59374246 ≈ 192.45.

Sum of PVs: 310.23 + 192.45 = 502.68.

Subtract initial investment: 502.68 - 500 = 2.68. So about $2.68.

Hmm, but none of the options match exactly, but the closest is option J: $3.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial understanding. Wait, the project costs $500 today, so that's a cash outflow of $500. The cash inflows are $500 in year 5 and $500 in year 10. So the net cash flows are:

Year 0: -500

Year 5: +500

Year 10: +500

So the NPV is the sum of the present values of the inflows minus the initial outflow.

So, as I calculated, the sum of PVs is approximately 502.68, so 502.68 - 500 = 2.68. So about $2.68, which is approximately $3. So the correct answer would be J.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are rounded, so the answer is J: $3.

To calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of the investment project, we consider the cash flows and discount them at the given rate of 10%. The project involves an initial investment of $500 today (a cash outflow) and generates cash inflows of $500 in year 5 and $500 in year 10. The NPV is calculated as the sum of the present values of all cash flows.

1. **Initial Investment (Year 0):**  
   The initial cost is $500, which is a cash outflow at time zero. No discounting is applied here.

2. **Cash Inflow in Year 5:**  
   The present value of $500 received in year 5 is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   PV_1 = \frac{500}{(1 + 0.10)^5}
   \]  
   Using \((1.10)^5 = 1.61051\), we find:  
   \[
   PV_1 = \frac{500}{1.61051} \approx 310.23
   \]

3. **Cash Inflow in Year 10:**  
   The present value of $500 received in year 10 is calculated as:  
   \[
   PV_2 = \frac{500}{(1 + 0.10)^{10}}
   \]  
   Using \((1.10)^{10} = 2.59374\), we find:  
   \[
   PV_2 = \frac{500}{2.59374} \approx 192.45
   \]

4. **Total Present Value of Inflows:**  
   Adding the present values of the two cash inflows:  
   \[
   PV_{\text{total}} = PV_1 + PV_2 = 310.23 + 192.45 = 502.68
   \]

5. **NPV Calculation:**  
   Subtract the initial investment from the total present value of inflows:  
   \[
   NPV = PV_{\text{total}} - \text{Initial Investment} = 502.68 - 500 = 2.68
   \]

The calculated NPV is approximately $2.68. Among the given options, the closest value is **$3**.
