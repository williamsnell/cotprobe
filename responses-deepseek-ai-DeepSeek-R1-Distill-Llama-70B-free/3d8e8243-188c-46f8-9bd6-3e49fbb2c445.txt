Question:

A city resident commuted to work each day by subway. After purchasing her subway ticket, the resident entered the subway for her ride downtown to where she was employed. Looking for a seat, the resident was walking toward the rear of the subway car when it came to an abrupt halt. As a result of the sudden stop, the resident fell onto a commuter, injuring him. If the commuter asserts a claim against the subway company to recover for his personal injuries, the commuter will probably

Options:

A: not prevail, if the subway company can prove that the stop was necessary to avoid a collision
B: prevail, because the sudden stop caused the resident to fall onto him.
C: not prevail, if the resident can prove she was pushed causing her to fall onto the commuter.
D: prevail, because a special duty of care was owed him.
E: not prevail, if the commuter had prior knowledge of the subway's abrupt stops
F: not prevail, if the resident was negligent in not holding onto the hand rail.
G: prevail, if the subway company was negligent in maintaining the subway car's balance
H: prevail, if the subway company failed to warn passengers about the abrupt stop
I: prevail, if the subway company failed to provide enough seats for all passengers
J: not prevail, if the operator of the subway was not negligent in making the stop.

Okay, so I have this question about tort law, specifically negligence. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is a city resident who takes the subway to work. She buys her ticket and enters the subway car. She's looking for a seat and walks towards the rear. Then the subway makes an abrupt stop, causing her to fall onto another commuter, who gets injured. The commuter is now suing the subway company for his injuries.

The question is asking whether the commuter will probably prevail in his claim against the subway company. There are multiple options, and I need to figure out the correct one.

First, I remember that in negligence cases, the plaintiff must show that the defendant owed a duty of care, breached that duty, and that the breach caused the plaintiff's injury. The subway company, as a common carrier, owes its passengers a high duty of care. They have to ensure the safety of their passengers.

So, the key issue here is whether the subway company's sudden stop was negligent. If the stop was necessary to avoid a collision, then perhaps the company wasn't negligent. But if the stop was unnecessary or done in a way that was unreasonable, then they might be liable.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Not prevail if the subway company proves the stop was necessary to avoid collision. That makes sense because if the stop was necessary, there's no negligence. The company would have acted reasonably, so no breach of duty.

Option B: Prevail because the sudden stop caused her to fall. But causation isn't the only factor here; the company's action (or inaction) must be negligent. So just because the stop caused the fall doesn't automatically mean the company is liable.

Option C: Not prevail if the resident was pushed. Wait, the resident was walking and fell because of the stop. If she was pushed by someone else, that might be a different issue. But the question doesn't mention another person pushing her, so I'm not sure this is relevant.

Option D: Prevail because of a special duty. Subway companies do have a high duty, but if they didn't breach it, this doesn't help.

Option E: Not prevail if commuter knew about abrupt stops. Prior knowledge might relate to assumption of risk, but I'm not sure if that applies here. The commuter could have known, but if the stop was negligently done, the company is still liable.

Option F: Not prevail if the resident was negligent. So if she wasn't holding the handrail, maybe she's partially at fault. But the claim is against the subway company, not the resident. So even if she was negligent, the subway's negligence would be the key issue.

Option G: Prevail if the subway was negligent in maintaining balance. If the subway car's maintenance caused the stop, but the question is about the stop itself, not the car's condition.

Option H: Prevail if subway failed to warn. They might warn about sudden stops, but I'm not sure if that's a standard duty. Maybe not the main issue here.

Option I: Prevail if not enough seats. The number of seats probably isn't the issue; the fall was due to the stop, not lack of seating.

Option J: Not prevail if the operator wasn't negligent. This seems similar to option A. If the operator made the stop without negligence, the company isn't liable.

Wait, so the main point is whether the stop was done negligently. If the stop was necessary to avoid a collision, then the operator wasn't negligent, so the company isn't liable. So the commuter wouldn't prevail.

In that case, option A and J are similar. Option A says the company can prove the stop was necessary, so not liable. Option J says if the operator wasn't negligent, commuter doesn't prevail.

I think the operator's actions are the key here. If the operator made a sudden stop without negligence (like an emergency), then the subway isn't liable. So the correct answer would be A or J.

Wait, let me think again. The subway company's duty is to operate safely. If the stop was necessary to avoid a collision, then it's reasonable and not negligent. So the commuter's claim would fail because the company didn't breach their duty.

Therefore, option A says the commuter won't prevail if the company proves the stop was necessary. That makes sense. So the answer should be A.

Alternatively, option J says the commuter won't prevail if the operator wasn't negligent. That's essentially the same as A because the operator's action (the stop) being non-negligent would mean the company isn't liable.

Wait, but the options are worded differently. Option A is about the stop being necessary to avoid collision, which is a specific reason. Option J is broader, about any non-negligent stop.

In the scenario, the stop was abrupt, but unless it was done negligently, the company isn't liable. So if the operator wasn't negligent in making the stop, the commuter can't recover. So option J is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting confused between A and J. Let me think about the elements. For the subway company to be liable, their action (the stop) must be negligent. If the stop was necessary to avoid a collision, then the action wasn't negligent. So in that case, the commuter doesn't prevail, which is option A.

But option J says if the operator wasn't negligent in making the stop. So if the operator made the stop without being negligent, the commuter doesn't win. So both A and J hinge on the absence of negligence.

But in this case, the question is about the subway company's liability. The operator's actions are the company's actions. So option J is about the operator not being negligent, which would mean the company isn't liable. So option J would make the commuter not prevail.

Wait, but the initial reason is that the sudden stop caused the injury. So the key is whether the stop was made negligently. If the stop was necessary, then it's not negligent. So option A would apply.

Wait, the question is, which of these options is correct. So if the subway company can prove that the stop was necessary to avoid a collision (option A), the commuter doesn't win. Similarly, if the operator wasn't negligent (option J), the commuter doesn't win. So which is the better answer.

I think the correct answer is A because it's about the reason for the stop. If the stop was necessary to avoid a collision, then the subway company's action was reasonable, so no negligence. Therefore, the commuter can't recover, making option A correct.

Wait, but another angle: in some jurisdictions, common carriers can be held to a higher standard, sometimes even strict liability for injuries, but I think that's not the case here. Generally, it's negligence, so the carrier must have been at fault.

So, the correct answer is A: not prevail if the stop was necessary to avoid collision.

The question revolves around whether the commuter can recover for his injuries caused by the sudden stop of the subway. The key issue is whether the subway company was negligent in making the stop. As a common carrier, the subway company owes its passengers a high duty of care, but if the stop was necessary to avoid a collision, the company would not be considered negligent, as the action was reasonable under the circumstances.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: If the subway company can prove the stop was necessary to avoid a collision, the commuter will not prevail. This is correct because a necessary stop to avoid a collision would not constitute negligence.
- **Option B**: The fact that the sudden stop caused the fall is insufficient to establish liability without proving negligence on the part of the subway company.
- **Option C**: There is no evidence in the scenario that the resident was pushed, making this option irrelevant.
- **Option D**: While the subway company owes a high duty of care, the commuter must still prove a breach of that duty, which is absent if the stop was necessary.
- **Option E**: Prior knowledge of abrupt stops does not absolve the subway company of liability if the stop was negligently executed.
- **Option F**: The resident's potential negligence in not holding onto the handrail is irrelevant to the claim against the subway company.
- **Option G**: The maintenance of the subway car's balance is not directly tied to the sudden stop in question.
- **Option H**: Failure to warn about abrupt stops is not the primary issue here, as the stop itself is the focus of the claim.
- **Option I**: The number of seats is unrelated to the cause of the injury.
- **Option J**: If the operator was not negligent in making the stop, the commuter will not prevail. This is similar to Option A but broader in scope.

The best answer is **Option A**, as it specifically addresses the reasonableness of the stop to avoid a collision, which directly negates negligence on the part of the subway company.
