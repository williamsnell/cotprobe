Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically regarding attempted murder. I'm a bit rusty on my law stuff, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the scenario is about a husband and wife who are unhappily married. The husband is an alcoholic and physically abuses the wife when he's drunk. One night, after he beats her, the wife decides to kill him. She's experienced with firearms and plans to shoot him while he's sleeping. Before she does that, she takes out a $1,000,000 life insurance policy on him, making herself the beneficiary. Then, they celebrate their 10th anniversary, have a great time, and she changes her mind, deciding she loves him and doesn't want to kill him. She confesses to him, but he's outraged, files for divorce, and tells the police about her plan. Now, she's charged with attempted murder. The question is whether she's guilty or not.

The options are A to J, but I need to focus on the reasoning first.

So, the key here is the legal definition of attempted murder. Attempted murder requires both intent to kill and a substantial step towards commission of the crime. It's specific intent, meaning the person must have intended to kill, and more than just preparation is needed—they must take a significant step towards the act.

In this case, she planned to kill him. She took out a life insurance policy, which seems like a step toward the plan. But then she changed her mind before actually taking any action like pulling the trigger or even getting the gun ready. She confessed before doing anything.

Wait, did she take a substantial step? She bought a gun? No, wait, she's experienced in firearms, but the question doesn't say she bought the gun. She planned to use a firearm, but the specific step she took was purchasing the insurance policy. Hmm.

Is purchasing a life insurance policy a substantial step towards murder? I'm not sure. It could be considered as part of the planning, but whether it's enough for an attempt charge. Sometimes, courts look for actions that go beyond mere preparation. Like, if she had bought a gun, that might be a step. But here, she already had the experience, so maybe she already owned a gun. She took out the insurance, which might be a step towards the plan, but does that count as a substantial step?

Also, she changed her mind before acting. She didn't go through with the shooting. She told him before doing anything. So, did she take a substantial step beyond just planning?

I remember that in some jurisdictions, actions like purchasing a weapon or insurance can be seen as substantial steps. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, some might argue that purchasing the insurance is just part of the planning and not a concrete step toward the act itself.

Another point is that she didn't actually perform the act. She didn't pull the trigger. So, under the doctrine of attempt, she would need to have taken a step that a reasonable person would see as intended to result in the crime.

Wait, but she planned it, intended to do it, took the insurance policy. But then she decided not to. So, did her change of heart before taking the actual step matter?

Alternatively, does the purchase of the insurance policy count as a substantial step? That's the crux. If it does, then she could be guilty of attempted murder because she took that step. If it doesn't, then she hasn't gone far enough, and she's not guilty.

Looking at the options, option A says not guilty because she didn't perform a substantial step. Option E says guilty because she intended to kill. But intent alone isn't enough; you need the substantial step. Option F says guilty because she bought the insurance. So if that's a substantial step, F would be correct.

But some might argue that buying insurance is just part of planning and not a direct step towards the murder. So, maybe A is correct. Option I says guilty because she planned it, but planning isn't enough without the substantial step.

Wait, the Model Penal Code (MPC) approach might be relevant. The MPC requires a 'substantial step' in furtherance of the crime. A substantial step is more than mere preparation. So, if she took the insurance, that could be seen as a step beyond preparation, as it's a concrete action toward the goal.

Alternatively, common law requires more than just intent and a substantial step, but perhaps proximity to the crime.

Wait, in common law, the test for attempt is whether the defendant took a step beyond mere preparation, showing that the crime was about to be committed. So, buying insurance could be a significant step, but I'm not entirely sure.

I think the key here is whether purchasing the life insurance policy is a substantial step. If yes, then she's guilty. If not, she's not guilty.

In some cases, actions like buying a gun or poison are seen as substantial steps. So, in this case, buying the insurance might be considered a substantial step because it's an action that would facilitate the crime, as she'd benefit financially. So, perhaps the court would find that she took a substantial step.

Alternatively, some might argue that the purchase of the insurance is too remote from the actual act of killing. It's more about the motive or the potential gain, not the actual execution.

I'm a bit torn. Let me think again. The steps she took were planning to shoot him, taking out the insurance. She didn't actually get the gun ready or do anything else. So, maybe the insurance is a step, but not a substantial one.

But wait, she is experienced in firearms, so perhaps the purchase of insurance is a significant step because she's making sure she'll benefit, which could be seen as a crucial part of the plan. But I'm not certain.

If I recall, the case of People v. Warterfield held that purchasing life insurance could be part of the attempt if it's a step toward the murder. But I'm not sure if that's the majority view.

Alternatively, the case of People v. Dlugash held that actions like purchasing a casket could be part of the attempt. So, if she bought the insurance, that might be a substantial step.

But without more concrete steps, like obtaining the weapon or lying in wait, the insurance alone might not be enough. So, perhaps she hasn't taken a substantial step yet.

Wait, but she planned to shoot him while he slept. So, that's a specific plan. She also took out the insurance. That might be enough for a substantial step.

Alternatively, the fact that she changed her mind and didn't go through with it might affect the charge, but I don't think so because the attempt is about the intent and the steps taken before the change of heart.

So, considering all this, I think the purchase of the insurance could be considered a substantial step. Therefore, she would be guilty of attempted murder. Looking at the options, option F says guilty because she purchased the life insurance policy. Alternatively, option I says guilty because she planned it, but planning alone isn't enough. So, option F is about the substantial step.

Wait, but another angle: the common law requires not only intent but also an overt act that is a substantial step toward the crime. So, the insurance could be seen as a substantial step.

Therefore, the correct answer would be guilty because she purchased the insurance, which is a substantial step. So, option F is correct.

Wait, but some might argue that buying insurance is not a direct step towards the murder. It's more about the motive. Hmm. Alternatively, it's a step towards the plan because the plan includes financial gain. So, it's part of the execution.

I think the answer is F. She took a substantial step by purchasing the insurance, indicating her commitment to the plan. Therefore, she is guilty of attempted murder.

The question revolves around whether the wife can be convicted of attempted murder. Attempted murder requires both specific intent to kill and the commission of a substantial step toward that goal. The wife planned to shoot her husband, took out a life insurance policy on him, and then changed her mind before taking any further action, such as firing a weapon.

The key issue is whether purchasing the life insurance policy constitutes a substantial step. Under the law, a substantial step is an action that goes beyond mere preparation and demonstrates a commitment to completing the crime. Courts have sometimes considered actions like purchasing life insurance as substantial steps when they are directly tied to facilitating the crime, as they indicate a level of commitment and planning.

In this case, the wife’s purchase of the life insurance policy can be seen as a substantial step because it was part of her plan to kill her husband and financially benefit from his death. Although she did not take further actions like obtaining a weapon or attempting to carry out the act, the insurance purchase demonstrates a concrete commitment to the plan. Therefore, she meets the legal requirements for attempted murder.

Option F correctly identifies that the purchase of the life insurance policy constitutes a substantial step, making her guilty of attempted murder.

Answer: F
