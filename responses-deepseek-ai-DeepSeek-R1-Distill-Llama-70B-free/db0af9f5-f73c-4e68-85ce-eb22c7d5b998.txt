Question:

This question refers to the following information.
All this while the Indians came skulking about them, and would sometimes show themselves aloof off, but when any approached near them, they would run away; and once they stole away their tools where they had been at work and were gone to dinner. But about the 16th of March, a certain Indian came boldly amongst them and spoke to them in broken English, which they could well understand but marveled at it. At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them. His name was Samoset. He told them also of another Indian whose name was Squanto, a native of this place, who had been in England and could speak better English than himself.

Okay, so I've got this question about American history, specifically related to the interactions between early European settlers and Native Americans. The passage is from William Bradford's "History of Plymouth Plantation," and it talks about two Native Americans, Samoset and Squanto, who interacted with the English settlers.

The question is asking me to compare Samoset and Squanto to one of the given options, which are all names of various Native American leaders. I need to figure out which one they can be most directly compared to.

Let me start by recalling what I know about these two individuals. Samoset was an Eastern Abenaki who spoke some English because he had encountered English fishermen. He approached the Plymouth colonists and provided them with useful information about the local area and the other Native American tribes. Later, Squanto, who was a Patuxet, also made contact with the colonists. Squanto had been to England, so he spoke better English and helped the settlers adapt to farming in the area, which was crucial for their survival.

So both Samoset and Squanto acted as intermediaries between the English settlers and the local Native American populations. They helped bridge the communication gap and provided valuable information and assistance, which was essential for the settlers' survival and success in the New World.

Now, looking at the options provided: A through I are all names of Native American leaders, some more famous than others. I need to think about which of these individuals also acted as a similar kind of intermediary or guide between Native Americans and European settlers or explorers.

Option G is Sacagawea. I remember that Sacagawea was a Shoshone woman who accompanied the Lewis and Clark Expedition. She acted as a guide and interpreter, helping the expedition navigate the Western territories and communicate with various Native tribes they encountered. Her role was crucial because she facilitated the interaction between the explorers and the Native Americans, much like how Samoset and Squanto helped the Plymouth colonists.

The other options are all notable leaders but perhaps didn't serve in the same intermediary role. For example, figures like Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull, and Geronimo were more involved in resistance against the U.S. government and military, rather than acting as guides or interpreters for European settlers. Chiefs like Red Cloud and Black Hawk led their tribes in conflicts, and while they may have had interactions with whites, their roles weren't primarily as interpreters or guides in the same way.

Tecumseh and Chief Joseph were significant leaders who tried to resist American expansion, and Cochise was an Apache leader involved in conflicts. None of these roles quite match the intermediary and guide roles that Samoset, Squanto, and Sacagawea played.

Therefore, the most direct comparison would be to Sacagawea because she, like Samoset and Squanto, served as a bridge between the European settlers/explorers and the Native American populations, providing crucial assistance and facilitating communication.

The most direct comparison to Samoset and Squanto is Sacagawea. Both Samoset and Squanto acted as intermediaries and guides for European settlers, facilitating communication and providing essential assistance. Similarly, Sacagawea played a crucial role as a guide and interpreter for the Lewis and Clark Expedition, bridging the gap between explorers and Native American tribes.
