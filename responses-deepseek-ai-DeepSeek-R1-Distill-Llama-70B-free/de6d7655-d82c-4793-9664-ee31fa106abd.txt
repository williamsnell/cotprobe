Okay, so I have this question about gradient descent and its computational cost. Hmm, let's see what I remember.

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning, right? The basic idea is to adjust the parameters in the direction that reduces the cost function. I think it's often used in training models like linear regression.

The question says that the gradient of the cost function is already computed and stored in a vector g. So, the next step would be to update the parameters using this gradient. But what's the cost, computationally, of performing one such update?

I recall that in gradient descent, the update step involves subtracting the gradient multiplied by a learning rate from the current parameters. So if the parameters are a vector θ, the update would be θ = θ - α * g, where α is the learning rate.

Wait, but what's the computational complexity here? The gradient g is already computed, so that's not part of what we're calculating now. The update step is just taking each component of g and subtracting it scaled by α from each θ component.

So, the cost here depends on how many operations we're doing. If the parameter vector θ has D dimensions, then for each dimension, we perform a subtraction and a multiplication (scaling by α). Each of these operations is O(1) per element, right?

So for D elements, it's O(D) operations. There's no need for matrix multiplications or anything more complex because we're just updating each element individually.

Looking at the options, the choices are all about Big O notation. Option C is O(1), which would mean a constant time regardless of the size, but that doesn't make sense because if D increases, the time should increase. Option I is O(D), which fits because each of the D elements is processed once.

Wait, are there any other factors? Like, maybe the cost function or how the gradient was computed? Oh, but the question states that the gradient is already computed, so we don't consider the computation of g here. We're only looking at the update step.

So, the update is just a vector subtraction and scaling, which is linear in the number of parameters D. Therefore, the cost is O(D).

The question asks about the computational cost of performing one gradient descent update when the gradient is already computed. In gradient descent, the update step involves adjusting the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient, typically using the formula:

\[
\theta = \theta - \alpha g
\]

Here, \( \theta \) represents the parameter vector, \( \alpha \) is the learning rate, and \( g \) is the gradient vector. The computational cost of this update depends on the number of operations required to subtract the scaled gradient from each parameter.

If the parameter vector \( \theta \) has \( D \) dimensions, then for each dimension, a single subtraction and a scalar multiplication are performed. These operations are \( O(1) \) per dimension, leading to a total complexity of \( O(D) \) for the entire update step. Importantly, the question specifies that the gradient \( g \) is already computed, so the cost of computing \( g \) is not included in the analysis.

Among the given options, \( O(D) \) corresponds to option **I**, which correctly represents the linear dependence of the update step on the number of parameters.
