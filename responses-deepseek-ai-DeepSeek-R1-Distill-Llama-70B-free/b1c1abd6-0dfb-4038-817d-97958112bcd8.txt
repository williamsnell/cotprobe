Question:

In 1996, a developer purchased a 100-acre tract located in a northern county in a state. Shortly thereafter, the developer prepared a subdivision plan that created 100 one-acre residential building lots on this tract. In 1997, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. During the next few years, the developer sold 60 residential lots to individual purchasers. Each deed specified that every lot designated on the subdivision plan was to be recorded in the county recorder's office. Each deed also provided the following:"No house trailer or mobile home shall be built or maintained on any lot within the subdivision. "In 2003, the developer conveyed the remaining 40 lots to a builder by deed that included language identical to that contained in the first 60 deeds. This deed from the developer to the builder was recorded. By 2008, the builder had sold all of the 40 lots. Each of these deeds identified each lot as being a part of the subdivision, but did not include the clause relating to mobile homes. On January 30, 2009, a buyer, who had purchased one of the residential lots from the builder, placed a mobile home on his property. Which of the following statements is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?

Options:

A: The buyer has no obligation to remove the mobile home.
B: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of contract.
C: The deed from the builder to the buyer did not include the covenant prohibiting mobile homes.
D: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer.
E: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate.
F: The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes.
G: The buyer should have had actual notice of the restriction against mobile homes.
H: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner.
I: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes was not recorded with the county recorder's office.
J: The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could only be enforced by the original developer.

Okay, let's try to tackle this real property question. So, the scenario is about a developer who created a subdivision with 100 one-acre lots. The developer recorded the subdivision plan in 1997. Each of the first 60 deeds sold by the developer included a covenant prohibiting mobile homes. Then, in 2003, the developer sold the remaining 40 lots to a builder, and that deed also included the same covenant. The builder then sold all 40 lots, but their deeds didn't include the mobile home clause. Now, a buyer who bought from the builder put a mobile home on his lot in 2009. The question is about which statement is least accurate regarding the buyer's deed.

Hmm, first, I need to recall the law on covenants running with the land. For a covenant to run with the land, it must meet certain criteriaâ€”like being in writing, intended to run, touch and concern the land, and there must be horizontal privity (original parties) and vertical privity (subsequent owners) for it to bind future owners.

In this case, the original developer included the covenant in the first 60 deeds. Those deeds were recorded. Then, the developer conveyed the next 40 lots to the builder with the same covenant, and that deed was recorded too. So the builder's deed had the covenant. But when the builder sold the lots, the new deeds didn't include the covenant. So the buyer didn't get it in their deed.

Wait, but does that mean the buyer is still bound by the covenant if it's in the chain of title? Because if the covenant was properly recorded in the builder's deed, then when the builder sold to the buyer, the buyer might still be bound. But wait, the builder's deed to the buyer didn't include the covenant. So would the buyer have constructive notice because it was in the prior deed?

Constructive notice is about what a buyer should know when they check the records. If the covenant was in the builder's deed, which was recorded, then when the builder sold to the buyer, the buyer would have been expected to search the chain of title and find that the builder's lot was subject to the covenant.

Wait, but in the builder's sale to the buyer, the deed didn't include the covenant. So does that mean the covenant wasn't in the buyer's deed? Or is the covenant in the prior deed (from developer to builder) sufficient to bind the buyer?

I think that for the covenant to run with the land to the buyer, it needs to be in the chain of title. So if the original developer's deed to the builder included the covenant and was recorded, then the buyer, when taking from the builder, would be subject to that covenant if it's properly recorded.

But wait, when the builder sold to the buyer, the deed from builder to buyer didn't include the covenant. So the buyer's deed doesn't have it, but the builder's deed did. So when the buyer records their deed, the prior deed (builder's) is part of the chain. So the buyer would have constructive notice of any covenants in that prior deed.

So looking at the options:

Option C: The deed from the builder to the buyer did not include the covenant. That's correct, but is it the least accurate statement? The question asks which is least accurate, meaning incorrect.

Wait, the question says which statement is least accurate about the buyer's deed. So the buyer's deed didn't have the covenant, so statements about the buyer's deed not having it would be accurate, not least accurate.

Wait, the options are about the buyer's deed. So let's go through each option.

Option A: The buyer has no obligation to remove the mobile home. If the covenant is enforceable against the buyer, then A would be inaccurate. But if the covenant doesn't bind the buyer, then A is correct.

Option B: All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of contract. Wait, privity of contract is about being parties to the same contract. The builder's grantees (like the buyer) weren't in privity with the original developer. So B might not be correct because privity of contract isn't there. But I'm not sure.

Option C: The deed from builder to buyer did not include the covenant. That's correct, so the statement is accurate. So it's not the least accurate.

Option D: The covenant ran with the land as far as the builder, but not the buyer. So if the covenant only applied to the builder but not the buyer, then D would be correct. But if the covenant runs to the buyer, D is incorrect. I think that because the covenant was recorded in the builder's deed, the buyer would still be bound. So D's statement would be inaccurate.

Option E: Subsequent grantees in privity of estate. Privity of estate is about having a mutual interest in the same property. Each grantee from the builder would have privity with the builder, as they take the same estate. So E is accurate.

Option F: Buyer had constructive notice. Since the covenant was in the builder's recorded deed, the buyer would have constructive notice. So F is accurate.

Option G: Buyer had actual notice. The question doesn't say the buyer knew, so G is inaccurate. So G would be an incorrect statement, making it the least accurate.

Option H: Covenant could be enforced by any lot owner. For that, the covenant needs to be considered an equitable servitude and touch and concern the land. If all lots have the same covenant, then each owner can enforce it against others. But if the builder's lots didn't include the covenant in their deeds, maybe not. Wait, no, the builder's deed had the covenant. So H might be accurate, because all lots (except maybe the builder's 40) have the covenant. Hmm, but if the builder's 40 lots' deeds to the buyers didn't include it, then those buyers wouldn't be bound? Or would they because of the prior deed?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure this.

1. Developer creates subdivision and records the plan in 1997. So the plan is part of the public records.

2. Developer sells 60 lots, each deed includes the covenant and is recorded. So those 60 lots are definitely subject to the covenant.

3. Developer sells 40 lots to the builder in 2003, deed includes the covenant and is recorded. So the builder's lots are subject to the covenant.

4. Builder sells the 40 lots, but their deeds don't include the covenant. So each buyer from the builder only has a deed without the covenant.

But because the builder's own deed (from developer) includes the covenant and is recorded, when the builder sells, the buyer's deed would still be subject to that covenant because it's in the chain of title. So the buyer has constructive notice.

So the covenant runs with the land from the builder to the buyer because:

- It's in writing.

- The original deed (developer to builder) shows intent to run.

- Touches and concerns the land (affects use, value).

- There was horizontal privity between developer and builder.

- Vertical privity exists between builder and buyer.

Therefore, the covenant would bind the buyer, even though it's not in their deed, because it's in the prior recorded deed.

So looking back at the options:

Option G says the buyer had actual notice. The question doesn't state that, so G is incorrect. So G is the least accurate statement.

Wait, but what about option J? Option J says the covenant could only be enforced by the original developer. That's not true because once the covenant runs with the land, any lot owner can enforce it. So J is incorrect.

So looking at the options again.

The question is: which statement is least accurate with respect to the buyer's deed.

So the buyer's deed didn't include the covenant. So statements about the buyer's deed not having it are accurate. So C is accurate.

The question is about the buyer's deed. So which option is incorrect about the buyer's deed.

Wait, the question is about the buyer's deed. So each option is a statement about the buyer's deed.

Wait, no. The question says, "Which of the following statements is LEAST accurate with respect to the buyer's deed?"

So the options are about the buyer's deed, but some options are about other things.

Wait, no, the options are general statements, but the question is about which is least accurate regarding the buyer's deed. So perhaps the incorrect statement is about the buyer's deed.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the buyer's deed doesn't include the covenant. So in the buyer's deed, there's no mention. So statements that the buyer's deed didn't include it (C) are accurate. So C is correct, so it's not the least accurate.

Option G says the buyer had actual notice. But the buyer's deed didn't include the covenant. Unless the buyer actually knew, which isn't stated, G is wrong. So G is least accurate.

Option F says constructive notice. Since the covenant was in the builder's recorded deed, the buyer would have constructive notice. So F is accurate.

So the least accurate statement is G.

Wait, but option J says the covenant could only be enforced by the developer. But since the covenant runs with the land, other lot owners can enforce it. So J is incorrect.

Wait, so which is the least accurate? The question is about the buyer's deed. So perhaps the options relate to the buyer's deed.

Alternatively, perhaps the covenant didn't run to the buyer because the builder's deed didn't include it when selling to the buyer.

Wait no, because the builder's own deed was subject to the covenant, which was recorded. So the buyer would take subject to that covenant.

Wait, but for a covenant to run with the land, it must be intended to do so. The developer included it in the deed to the builder, and it was recorded. So when the builder sells, even if the new deed doesn't mention it, the covenant still applies because it's in the prior deed.

So the buyer is bound by the covenant.

So now, looking at the options again.

Option D: The covenant ran with the land as far as the builder but not the buyer. That would be incorrect because the covenant does run to the buyer.

So D is an incorrect statement, making it a candidate for least accurate.

Option J: Only the developer can enforce. But any owner can enforce, so J is incorrect.

So which is the least accurate? The question is about the buyer's deed.

So, the buyer's deed didn't include the covenant (C is accurate). So the least accurate statement would be something that's incorrect regarding the buyer's deed.

Wait, the buyer's deed is from the builder, and the builder's deed had the covenant. So when the builder sold to the buyer, the buyer's deed doesn't mention it. But the covenant is still enforceable against the buyer because it's in the prior deed.

So, regarding the buyer's deed, which statements are accurate or not.

Option H: The covenant could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner. If that's true, then H is correct. Because all the lots are part of the same subdivision with the same covenant, any owner can enforce it. So H is accurate.

Option I: The covenant wasn't recorded. But the developer's deed to the builder was recorded, so I is incorrect. Wait, no, the covenant was in the developer's deed to the builder, which was recorded. So I is incorrect, making it a candidate.

Wait, no, the covenant was in the developer's deed to the builder, which was recorded. So the covenant is recorded, so I is inaccurate.

Wait, but the buyer's deed didn't record the covenant because it wasn't included. But the prior deed did. So I says the covenant wasn't recorded. That's incorrect because the developer-builder deed was recorded. So I is incorrect.

So, looking at the options:

The question is which statement is least accurate. So which of the options is incorrect.

Which is incorrect:

A: Buyer has no obligation. If the covenant is enforceable, A is incorrect.

B: Subsequent grantees in privity of contract. Probably incorrect.

C: Buyer's deed didn't include the covenant. Correct.

D: Covenant ran to builder but not buyer. Incorrect.

E: Subsequent grantees in privity of estate. Correct.

F: Constructive notice. Correct.

G: Actual notice. Probably incorrect.

H: Enforceable by any lot owner. Correct.

I: Covenant not recorded. Incorrect, because developer-builder deed was recorded.

J: Only developer can enforce. Incorrect.

So the least accurate statement is either D, I, J, G, or A.

The question is about the buyer's deed. So the buyer's deed didn't include the covenant. So statements about the buyer's deed are accurate.

The least accurate would be a statement that's wrong about the buyer's deed.

Looking again, the buyer's deed didn't include the covenant, so C is accurate. So the incorrect statements would be about other aspects.

The question is about the buyer's deed, but the options are general statements. So perhaps the answer is G, which claims the buyer had actual notice. Since the deed didn't include it, and there's no mention of actual notice, G is incorrect.

Alternatively, option D is incorrect because the covenant does run to the buyer.

Wait, the original covenant was in the developer's deed to the builder, which was recorded. So when the builder sold to the buyer, the buyer's deed would be subject to that covenant because it's in the chain of title. So the covenant runs with the land to the buyer, meaning D is incorrect.

So D says the covenant ran with the land as far as the builder but not the buyer. That's incorrect because it does run to the buyer.

So the least accurate statement would be D.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to outline:

1. For a covenant to run with the land at law (real covenant), it must meet certain criteria. But in modern law, many jurisdictions follow the theory of equitable servitudes, which are easier to enforce.

2. The key points are that the covenant is in writing, recorded, touches and concerns the land, and there's intent for it to run.

3. The developer included the covenant in the deed to the builder, which was recorded. So when the builder sells, the covenant is in the chain of title, so the buyer is bound, even if their deed doesn't mention it.

4. Therefore, the covenant does run to the buyer, making option D incorrect.

So among the options, D is incorrect.

Which option is least accurate? So the least accurate statement is D because it claims the covenant didn't run to the buyer, which is wrong.

Alternatively, option J is incorrect because it says only the developer can enforce, but actually, any lot owner can.

But the question is about the buyer's deed, so perhaps the incorrect statement relates to the deed.

Wait, no. The question isn't limited to statements about the deed itself, but about the buyer's deed. So perhaps the least accurate is G.

But I think I've spent too much time. Let me make an educated guess.

The correct answer is G. Because the buyer's deed didn't include the covenant, so the buyer wouldn't have actual notice unless they were told. So G is incorrect, making it the least accurate.
</think>

To determine the least accurate statement regarding the buyer's deed, we must analyze the scenario and the options provided. The key facts are:

1. The developer created a subdivision and recorded the plan in 1997. The first 60 deeds included a covenant prohibiting mobile homes, and these deeds were recorded.
2. In 2003, the developer sold 40 lots to the builder, and the deed included the same covenant. This deed was also recorded.
3. The builder sold all 40 lots, but the deeds to the buyers did not include the covenant. However, the covenant was still part of the chain of title through the builder's deed.
4. In 2009, a buyer purchased one of these lots from the builder and placed a mobile home on the property.

For a covenant to run with the land, it must meet certain criteria: it must be in writing, recorded, touch and concern the land, and there must be intent for it to run. In this case, the covenant was included in the developer's deed to the builder, which was recorded. Therefore, the buyer, as a subsequent grantee, would still be subject to the covenant because it is part of the chain of title, even though it was not explicitly included in the buyer's deed.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **A**: "The buyer has no obligation to remove the mobile home."  
  This is inaccurate because the covenant runs with the land and is enforceable against the buyer.

- **B**: "All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of contract."  
  This is inaccurate because privity of contract requires the parties to have been in the same contractual relationship, which is not the case here.

- **C**: "The deed from the builder to the buyer did not include the covenant prohibiting mobile homes."  
  This is accurate because the buyer's deed did not include the covenant.

- **D**: "The covenant prohibiting mobile homes ran with the land as far as the builder, but not as far as the buyer."  
  This is inaccurate because the covenant does run with the land to the buyer, as it was recorded in the chain of title.

- **E**: "All subsequent grantees of the builder would be in privity of estate."  
  This is accurate because privity of estate exists between the builder and the buyer, as they share an interest in the same property.

- **F**: "The buyer should have had constructive notice of the restriction against mobile homes."  
  This is accurate because the covenant was recorded in the builder's deed, which is part of the chain of title.

- **G**: "The buyer should have had actual notice of the restriction against mobile homes."  
  This is inaccurate because the question does not indicate that the buyer had actual knowledge of the covenant.

- **H**: "The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could be enforced by any subdivision lot owner."  
  This is accurate because the covenant touches and concerns the land and is part of the subdivision's restrictive agreements.

- **I**: "The covenant prohibiting mobile homes was not recorded with the county recorder's office."  
  This is inaccurate because the covenant was recorded in the developer's deed to the builder.

- **J**: "The covenant prohibiting mobile homes could only be enforced by the original developer."  
  This is inaccurate because the covenant runs with the land and can be enforced by any lot owner in the subdivision.

### Conclusion:
The least accurate statement is **G**, as it incorrectly claims that the buyer had actual notice of the covenant. The buyer's deed did not include the covenant, and there is no indication in the scenario that the buyer had actual knowledge of it. However, the buyer would still be bound by the covenant due to constructive notice from the recorded deed in the chain of title.
