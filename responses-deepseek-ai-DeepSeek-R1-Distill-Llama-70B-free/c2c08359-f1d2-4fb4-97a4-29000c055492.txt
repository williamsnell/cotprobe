Question:

In a prosecution of a defendant for receiving stolen property, an informer testified that the defendant sold him a stolen stereo, which the defendant knew had been stolen. During direct examination, the informer testified that he was unemployed but sometimes worked part-time as a substitute teacher. On cross-examination, the defendant's attorney asked the informer if he had recently filed an application to become a police officer. The informer responded affirmatively. The defendant's attorney then asked the informer the following question:"Isn't it true that you hope that by acting as an undercover agent, the police department will overlook the fact that you had two misdemeanor convictions for possession of marijuana?" The prosecuting attorney immediately objected. The trial judge should rule that the defendant's attorney's inquiry concerning the informer's hopes and misdemeanor convictions is

Options:

A: improper, as it infringes on the informer's personal privacy.
B: improper, as it is unrelated to the crime being prosecuted.
C: proper, as tending to show the informer's bad character for truthfulness.
D: improper, as it is speculative in nature.
E: proper, as relevant to the informer's possible bias.
F: proper, as it is a form of character evidence.
G: improper, as relating to convictions of crimes not punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year.
H: improper, as evidence of conduct not related to truthfulness.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with cross-examination of a witness. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a prosecution where the defendant is charged with receiving stolen property. The key witness here is an informer who testified that the defendant sold him a stolen stereo, and that the defendant knew it was stolen. 

During direct examination, the informer said he's unemployed but sometimes works part-time as a substitute teacher. Then, on cross-examination, the defense attorney asked if he recently applied to become a police officer, and he said yes. Now, the defense attorney is asking if the informer hopes that by acting as an undercover agent, the police might overlook his two misdemeanor convictions for marijuana possession. The prosecutor objected, and we need to figure out if the trial judge should allow this line of questioning.

The options are from A to H, each giving a different reason for why the question is proper or improper. So I need to analyze the situation to determine which option is correct.

First, I remember that in cross-examination, the opposing counsel can ask questions to challenge the witness's credibility. The main areas usually relate to bias, prior convictions, and other factors affecting truthfulness.

The question here is about the informer's possible bias. The defense is suggesting that the informer has a motive to cooperate with the policeâ€”hoping that his misdemeanor convictions will be overlooked if he helps them. This could mean the informer has a vested interest in the case's outcome, which might make him lie or exaggerate to gain favor with the police.

Now, looking at the options:

Option E says it's proper because it's relevant to possible bias. That makes sense because if the informer stands to gain (like getting a job as a police officer despite his convictions), he might be biased towards the prosecution. So this could affect his credibility.

Option C suggests it's about showing bad character for truthfulness. Well, the convictions themselves could do that, but the question is about his motive, which is more about bias than just bad character.

Option A says it's improper because it invades privacy. But I think that in court, a witness's prior convictions, especially misdemeanors, can be brought up if relevant. Privacy might not be a strong argument here since it's about credibility.

Option D says it's speculative. The question is about the informer's hopes, which is a state of mind. But in cross-examination, you can ask about potential biases, even if they're speculative, to assess credibility.

Option G mentions that the convictions are for crimes not punishable by more than a year. Wait, under the Federal Rules, a witness can be impeached with a conviction if it's a felony or a misdemeanor involving dishonesty or false statement. Marijuana possession is a crime of dishonesty? Maybe not. But here, the issue isn't about impeaching with the conviction itself but about the motive behind his testimony. So the convictions are being used to show bias, not to impeach his character for truthfulness per se.

Option B says it's unrelated to the crime. But the witness's credibility is always relevant, so I don't think this applies.

Option F is about character evidence. But in this case, the question is more about bias, which is a specific aspect of credibility, not general character evidence.

Option H says it's improper because it's about conduct unrelated to truthfulness. But if the conduct shows that the witness has a motive to lie (to gain favor), then it's related to his truthfulness.

So putting it all together, the defense attorney is trying to show that the informer has a motive (bias) to testify against the defendant. Therefore, the question is proper because it's relevant to the informer's possible bias. That points to option E.

In this case, the defense attorney's question is aimed at establishing the informer's potential bias. By suggesting that the informer hopes to gain favor with the police department (potentially overlooking his misdemeanor convictions) by acting as an undercover agent, the defense is implying that the informer has a vested interest in the outcome of the case. This could motivate him to testify in a way that benefits the prosecution, thereby undermining his credibility.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: The question does not improperly infringe on the informer's privacy because credibility and bias are legitimate areas of inquiry in cross-examination.
- **Option B**: The inquiry is not unrelated to the crime; it pertains to the witness's credibility, which is always relevant.
- **Option C**: While the question touches on the informer's character, its primary focus is on bias rather than general truthfulness.
- **Option D**: The question is not speculative; it directly addresses the informer's potential motive.
- **Option E**: This is correct because the question is proper as it relates to the informer's possible bias, which is a critical factor in assessing credibility.
- **Option F**: The question is not about general character evidence but specifically about bias.
- **Option G**: The convictions are not being used to impeach the informer's character but to show his potential motive for testifying favorably for the prosecution.
- **Option H**: The question is relevant to truthfulness because it highlights a potential motive to lie.

Thus, the trial judge should rule that the defense attorney's inquiry is proper because it is relevant to the informer's possible bias.
