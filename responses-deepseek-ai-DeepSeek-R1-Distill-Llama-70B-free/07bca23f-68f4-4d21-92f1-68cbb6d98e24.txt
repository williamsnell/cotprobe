Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because electric fields and potentials aren't my strongest topics. But I'll take it step by step.

The question has three parts: a, b, and c. All of them relate to a proton and the electric field or potential at certain distances. I remember that the electric field around a point charge is given by Coulomb's law, and the potential is related but a bit different. Let me think about each part one by one.

Starting with part (a): What is the magnitude of the electric field at a distance of 1 Å from a proton? I know the formula for the electric field E is E = k * q / r². Where k is Coulomb's constant, which I think is approximately 8.99e9 N·m²/C². The charge of a proton q is the elementary charge, about 1.6e-19 C. The distance r here is 1 Ångström, which is 1e-10 meters. Wait, wait, the question says 1 Å is 10^8 cm. Wait, no, 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. Hmm, wait 1e-8 cm would be 1e-10 meters, right? Because 1 cm is 1e-2 meters, so 1e-8 cm is 1e-10 meters. Yeah, that makes sense.

So plugging the numbers in: E = (8.99e9) * (1.6e-19) / (1e-10)^2. Let's compute that. The denominator is (1e-10)^2, which is 1e-20. So the denominator is 1e-20 m².

So numerator: 8.99e9 * 1.6e-19. Let me calculate that. 8.99 times 1.6 is about 14.384. Then the exponents: 1e9 * 1e-19 is 1e-10. So 14.384e-10. So 1.4384e-9.

Now divide by 1e-20. So 1.4384e-9 / 1e-20 = 1.4384e11 N/C? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the calculation seems off because I think I might have miscalculated somewhere. Let me recalculate.

Wait, E is in N/C, right? So let me try again.

E = k q / r².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².
q = 1.6e-19 C.
r = 1e-10 m.

So E = (8.988e9) * (1.6e-19) / ( (1e-10)^2 )

Calculating numerator: 8.988e9 * 1.6e-19 = let's see, 8.988 *1.6 = approx 14.38, and 1e9 *1e-19 = 1e-10. So 14.38e-10 = 1.438e-9.

Denominator: (1e-10)^2 = 1e-20.

So E = (1.438e-9) / (1e-20) = 1.438e11 N/C.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting E in N/C. The options are in V/cm. Oh, right! Because 1 N/C equals 1 V/m. So I need to convert the unit.

So 1.438e11 N/C is equal to 1.438e11 V/m. Because 1 V/m = 1 N/C. 

Wait, but the options are in V/cm, so I need to convert V/m to V/cm. There are 100 cm in a meter, so 1 V/m is 0.01 V/cm. Wait, no, wait, 1 V/m equals 100 V/cm? Wait no, 1 V/m is 1 volt per 100 cm, so 1 V/m = 0.01 V/cm. Wait, no, wait: 1 V/m is 1 volt per meter. There are 100 cm in a meter, so 1 V/m is 0.01 V per cm. So to get V/cm, I multiply the V/m by 100. Wait, no. Wait, if I have 1 V/m, which is 1 V per 100 cm, then per cm it's 0.01 V. So to get V/cm, you divide V/m by 100.

Wait, let me think again: 1 V/m is 1 V per meter. Since 1 meter is 100 cm, 1 V/m equals 1 V per 100 cm, which is 0.01 V per cm. So 1 V/m = 0.01 V/cm.

So if E is 1.438e11 V/m, then in V/cm it's 1.438e11 * 0.01 = 1.438e9 V/cm.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation. 1.438e11 V/m * (1 V/cm / 100 V/m) )= 1.438e9 V/cm.

So part (a) is approximately 1.438e9 V/cm. Now looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Looking at the options for part (a):

Option A: 1.5e9 V/cm,

Option B: 1.5e8,

Option C: 3.5e9,

Option E:4e9,

Option H:2.5e9,

Option I:2.8e9,

Option J:1.8e9.

Hmm, our calculation gave ~1.438e9, which is close to 1.5e9. So part (a) would be option A. But wait, let me check my calculations again. Maybe I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the product of k and q. Let me compute 8.99e9 * 1.6e-19 again.

8.99e9 = 8.99 * 1e9.

1.6e-19 is 1.6 * 1e-19.

Multiplying them: 8.99 * 1.6 = let's see, 8 *1.6=12.8, 0.99*1.6≈1.584, so total about 14.384. So 14.384e (9 + (-19)) = 14.384e-10 = 1.4384e-9.

Then when divided by (1e-10)^2 = 1e-20 m². So the denominator is 1e-20. So 1.4384e-9 / 1e-20 = 1.4384e11 N/C, which is 1.4384e11 V/m. Then converting to V/cm: 1.4384e11 * (1 cm/100 m) )? Wait no, wait, 1 V/m is 100 V/cm, because 1 V per 100 cm. So 1 V/m = 100 V/cm? Wait no, wait, that can't be right. Because 1 V/m is 1 V per 100 cm, which would mean 0.01 V/cm. So 1 V/m is 0.01 V/cm, so to get V/cm, you multiply V/m by 100? No, wait, no:

Wait, 1 V/m is 1 V per meter. 1 meter is 100 cm, so 1 V/m = 1 V / 100 cm = 0.01 V/cm. So to get V/cm, you take V/m and divide by 100.

So 1.4384e11 V/m divided by 100 is 1.4384e9 V/cm.

Which is approximately 1.4e9 V/cm. Looking at the options, option A is 1.5e9 V/cm. That's close, so (a) would be option A. But wait, let me double-check if perhaps I've made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, Coulomb's law is E = kq / r².

k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C²,

q is 1.6e-19 C,

r is 1e-10 m.

So E = 8.988e9 * 1.6e-19 / (1e-10)^2.

Compute denominator: (1e-10)^2 = 1e-20.

Numerator: 8.988e9 * 1.6e-19 = 8.988*1.6 = approx 14.38, and 1e9 * 1e-19 = 1e-10.

So numerator is 14.38e-10 = 1.438e-9.

So E = (1.438e-9) / (1e-20) = 1.438e11 N/C, which is 1.438e11 V/m.

Convert to V/cm: 1.438e11 V/m = 1.438e11 / 100 V/cm = 1.438e9 V/cm.

So that's about 1.4e9 V/cm, so the closest option is option A: 1.5e9 V/cm.

Now moving to part (b): What is the potential at this point? The electric potential due to a point charge is V = kq / r.

So same numbers as part (a): k=8.99e9, q=1.6e-19 C, r=1e-10 m.

So V = (8.99e9) * (1.6e-19) / (1e-10).

Calculate numerator: 8.99e9 * 1.6e-19 = 1.4384e-9.

Divide by 1e-10 m: 1.4384e-9 / 1e-10 = 14.384 volts.

So approximately 14.4 V. Now looking at the options, let's see which option has (a) 1.5e9 V/cm and (b) around 14-15 V.

Looking at option A: part (a) is 1.5e9 V/cm, part (b) is 15 V. That's a perfect match. Option J has (a) 1.8e9, (b)14V, but (a) is closer to 1.5e9 in our case.

So part (b) is 15 V, option A.

Now part (c): What is the potential difference, in volts, between positions 1 and 0.2 Å from a proton?

Potential difference is V1 - V2, where r1 is 1 Å and r2 is 0.2 Å. Since the proton is positive, the potential decreases as we move away, so V at 0.2 Å would be higher than at 1 Å.

So V(r) = kq / r.

So V1 = kq/(1e-10),

V2 = kq/(0.2e-10) = kq/(2e-11).

So the potential difference V1 - V2 is kq [1/(1e-10) - 1/(0.2e-10)].

Wait, the problem says "potential difference between positions 1 and 0.2 Å", but I'm not sure which is which. Wait, potential difference is V(r1) - V(r2). So if moving from r2=0.2 to r1=1, the potential difference is V(r1) - V(r2).

But wait, potential difference is usually ΔV = V_final - V_initial. So if you're moving from r1=1 to r2=0.2, then ΔV would be V(r2) - V(r1).

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of which is higher. Since the proton is positive, the electric potential decreases as you move away. So at r=0.2 Å, the potential is higher than at r=1 Å. So the potential difference between 1 and 0.2 would be V(0.2) - V(1). So positive.

So let's compute V(0.2) = kq/(0.2e-10) = (8.99e9)(1.6e-19)/(0.2e-10).

Similarly, V(1) is (8.99e9)(1.6e-19)/(1e-10) = 14.384 V as before.

Compute V(0.2):

8.99e9 * 1.6e-19 = 1.4384e-9.

Divide by 0.2e-10: 0.2e-10 = 2e-11.

1.4384e-9 / 2e-11 = (1.4384 / 2 ) * 1e2 = 0.7192 * 100 = 71.92 V.

So V(0.2) = ~72 V.

Then V(1) =14.384 V.

So the potential difference between 0.2 and 1 is 72 -14.384 = 57.616 V.

Wait, but the question is the potential difference between positions 1 and 0.2, which is V(1) - V(0.2) = 14.384 -72 = -57.616 V.

But usually, potential difference is taken as final minus initial. If you move from 1 to 0.2, the potential increases, so ΔV would be positive 57.6 V. So the magnitude is about 57.6 V.

Now looking at the options. Each option gives a set (a, b, c). So for part (c), the value is about 57.6 V. Looking at the options:

Option A: 60V,

Option E:72V,

Option I:88V,

Option J:56V.

Wait, our calculation gives about 57.6 V. The closest is option J:56V, or option A:60V. Hmm, but perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me recalculate V(r=0.2 Å):

r =0.2 Å = 0.2e-10 m = 2e-11 m.

V = (8.99e9) * (1.6e-19) / (2e-11)

Compute numerator: 8.99e9 * 1.6e-19 = 1.4384e-9.

Divide by 2e-11: 1.4384e-9 / 2e-11 = (1.4384 / 2) * (1e-9 / 1e-11) )= 0.7192 * 100 =71.92 V. So yes, that's correct.

So V(0.2)=71.92 V.

V(1)=14.38 V.

Potential difference V(0.2) - V(1)=57.54 V.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:60V, or option J:56V. Hmm, 57.5 is closer to 56 or 60? Well, 57.5 is 1.5 away from 56, and 2.5 away from 60. So maybe the correct option would have 56 or 60.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. The question says "potential difference between positions 1 and 0.2 Å". So if you take V(1) - V(0.2) = -57.5 V. The magnitude would be 57.5 V, but the question just says "potential difference". So perhaps they are considering the absolute value, so 57.5 V.

But looking at the options, none have exactly 57.5. The closest is option A:60V, and option J:56V.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in units.

Wait, let me recalculate V(r=0.2 Å):

k=8.99e9,

q=1.6e-19,

r=0.2e-10 = 2e-11 m.

So V = (8.99e9)(1.6e-19) / (2e-11)

Compute numerator: 8.99e9 *1.6e-19 = 1.4384e-9.

Divide by 2e-11: 1.4384e-9 / 2e-11 = 71.92 V.

Yes, correct.

V(1) is 14.38 V.

So the difference is 57.54 V.

Looking at the options, option A has 60V for part (c), option J has 56V.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the calculation. Let me try another approach. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for potential difference between two points around a point charge:

ΔV = kq (1/r1 - 1/r2)

Wait, no, actually, it's V(r1) - V(r2) = kq (1/r1 - 1/r2). Because V(r) = kq / r. So ΔV = V(r1) - V(r2) = kq (1/r1 - 1/r2).

Wait, r1=1e-10, r2=0.2e-10.

So 1/r1 = 1e10, 1/r2=5e10.

So 1/r1 - 1/r2 = 1e10 -5e10 = -4e10.

So ΔV = (8.99e9)(1.6e-19)(-4e10).

Compute that:

8.99e9 *1.6e-19 =1.4384e-9.

Multiply by (-4e10):

1.4384e-9 * (-4e10) = 1.4384 * (-4) * 1e1 = (-5.7536) * 10 = -57.536 V.

So the potential difference is -57.536 V. So the magnitude is 57.536 V.

But the options don't have this exact value. So the closest is either 56 or 60.

Now, looking at the options, option A is (a) 1.5e9 V/cm, (b)15V, (c)60V.

Option J is (a)1.8e9, (b)14V, (c)56V.

Hmm. In part (a), our calculation was 1.438e9 V/cm, which is closer to 1.5e9 (option A) than to 1.
