Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about human rights diplomacy, specifically on standard-setting. I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what the function of standard-setting in human rights diplomacy is. The options are A through J, each giving a different definition or explanation.

First, I need to understand what standard-setting means in this context. From what I remember, standard-setting in international human rights involves creating guidelines or norms that countries should follow. These are usually in the form of treaties, declarations, or conventions.

Looking at the options:

Option A says standard-setting means setting certain standards in human rights treaties. That sounds plausible because treaties are a primary way to establish these standards.

Option B mentions both binding and non-binding legal standards. I think some standards are treaties (which are binding) and others might be soft law, like resolutions or declarations, which aren't binding but still influential.

Option C says non-binding only, which seems too narrow because I believe standard-setting includes both types.

Option D talks about enforcing treaties, but standard-setting is more about creating the rules, not enforcing them. Enforcement would be a different function, like monitoring or implementation.

Option E is about establishing universal principles. That makes sense because human rights are often considered universal, but I'm not sure if that's the exact function of standard-setting or more the goal of the whole system.

Option F says merely proposing binding standards. "Merely" might be too restrictive because it's not just about proposing but also about agreeing on them through international consensus.

Option G is about non-binding proposals. Again, that's only part of it, so probably not the full picture.

Option H suggests only binding standards. But I think standard-setting includes both binding and non-binding, so H might be incomplete.

Option I is about proposing standards in treaties. That seems similar to A but maybe more specific. Treaties are a key part, but standard-setting can also occur through other documents.

Option J refers to creating guidelines for diplomacy. That might be part of it, but I'm not sure if that's the primary function.

Wait, so standard-setting is the process of creating these norms. So it's about putting forward both binding and non-binding standards. Treaties are binding (like the ICCPR), while things like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are considered non-binding but highly influential.

So looking back, option B says putting forward both binding and non-binding legal standards. That seems comprehensive. Option A is about treaties, which is a subset, but standard-setting isn't limited to treaties.

Option E is about universal principles, which is more the content rather than the function. The function is the act of setting the standards, which includes both binding and non-binding.

So I think the correct answer is B.

The function of standard-setting in human rights diplomacy involves creating norms and guidelines that nations should adhere to. This process includes both binding legal standards, such as those found in human rights treaties, and non-binding standards, like declarations or resolutions. While treaties establish enforceable obligations, non-binding standards provide influential guidance. Thus, standard-setting encompasses both types, making the most accurate description the one that includes both binding and non-binding legal standards.

Answer: B
