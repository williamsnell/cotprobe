Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about attachment patterns in children. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I remember about attachment styles.

So, attachment styles are based on how children behave when they're separated from their primary caregivers, usually their mothers, and how they react when the caregiver returns. The main styles are secure, anxious-avoidant, anxious-ambivalent, and disorganized-disoriented. Wait, sometimes I mix up the anxious ones, so I need to be careful.

The question is about a child with an insecure/anxious-avoidant pattern. From what I remember, anxious-avoidant kids are those who don't seem too distressed when their parent leaves. When the parent comes back, instead of running to them or being clingy, they might avoid the parent or even turn away. They don't seek comfort because maybe they've learned that the parent isn't reliable in providing comfort, so they cope by avoiding closeness.

Let me look at the options again. The question asks which option describes an insecure/anxious-avoidant child.

Option A: Shows little distress when separated and turns away when mother returns. That sounds like the avoidant type because they don't show much anxiety when the parent leaves and avoid the parent upon return.

Option B: More anxious when mother is absent and seeks contact on return. That might be the anxious-ambivalent type because they're anxious when the parent is gone and seek contact but maybe aren't easily comforted.

Option C: Very distressed when separated and remains anxious when mother returns. That could be the anxious-ambivalent or maybe disorganized. I think ambivalent kids are very upset when the parent leaves and are hard to comfort when they come back.

Option D: More anxious when mother is present and resists contact. Not sure, maybe avoidant? But I thought avoidant kids are less anxious when the parent is there. Or perhaps this is another type.

Option E: Very distressed but easily comforted. That sounds like secure attachment, not insecure.

Option F: No preference between stranger and mother. Maybe avoidant? Because they don't really seek comfort from the mother, so they might treat strangers similarly.

Option G: Extreme distress and clings. That's probably the anxious-ambivalent type.

Option H: Distressed when separated but pulls away upon return. That could be avoidant. Wait, so when the mother comes back, the child doesn't seek comfort and might pull away.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline each attachment style:

- Secure: Little distress when separated. Easily comforted upon return.
- Anxious-Avoidant (Insecure): Shows little distress when separated, may avoid the parent upon return, doesn't seek comfort.
- Anxious-Ambivalent (Insecure): Very distressed when separated, but upon return, is hard to comfort, may seek and then push away.
- Disorganized: Inconsistent behavior, might show fear or confusion upon return.

So the question is about anxious-avoidant. So the child doesn't get very upset when the mother leaves and when she comes back, avoids her.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: Shows little distress and turns away when she returns. That fits the avoidant pattern.

Option H: Very distressed when separated but pulls away upon return. Hmm, that seems a bit conflicting. If the child is very distressed, maybe that's more ambivalent. But I'm a bit confused because I thought avoidant kids aren't that distressed.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Another thought: Anxious-avoidant children might show some distress but not as much as ambivalent. Or perhaps they don't show much. Let me think again. I recall that in the Strange Situation test, avoidant children don't cry much when the mother leaves. When she comes back, they might not go to her and might even turn away.

So option A is a good fit. But wait, option H says the child is very distressed but pulls away. That seems more like ambivalent because they are very upset but then have mixed reactions.

Wait, no. Ambivalent kids are very upset when separated and then are hard to comfort. They might seek contact but then push the mother away. Avoidant kids aren't as distressed and avoid contact.

So the correct answer for anxious-avoidant is option A.

The question asks about a child with an insecure/anxious-avoidant pattern of attachment. This attachment style is characterized by children showing little distress when separated from their caregiver and avoiding the caregiver upon their return. They do not seek comfort and may turn away, as they have learned that the caregiver is not consistently reliable for comfort.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: "Shows little distress when separated from his/her mother and turns away from her when she returns." This aligns perfectly with the anxious-avoidant pattern, as the child exhibits minimal distress during separation and avoids the mother upon her return.
- **Option B**: Describes a child who is more anxious when the mother is absent and seeks contact upon her return. This is more characteristic of the anxious-ambivalent pattern.
- **Option C**: Describes a child who is very distressed during separation and remains anxious upon the mother's return. This fits the anxious-ambivalent or disorganized patterns.
- **Option D**: Suggests a child who is more anxious when the mother is present and resists contact. This does not align with the anxious-avoidant pattern.
- **Option E**: Describes a child who is easily comforted upon the mother's return, which is characteristic of a secure attachment.
- **Option F**: Indicates no preference between a stranger and the mother, which could suggest avoidant tendencies but is less specific.
- **Option G**: Describes extreme distress and clinging, typical of the anxious-ambivalent pattern.
- **Option H**: Suggests a child who is very distressed during separation but pulls away upon return. This seems more consistent with the anxious-ambivalent pattern due to the high level of distress.
- **Option I**: Indicates indifference to the mother's presence or absence, which does not fit the anxious-avoidant pattern.
- **Option J**: Suggests a child who seeks comfort from a stranger, which is inconsistent with the anxious-avoidant pattern.

The correct answer is **Option A**, as it accurately describes the behavior of a child with an insecure/anxious-avoidant attachment pattern.

Answer: A
