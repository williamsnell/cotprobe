Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating property tax. Hmm, let me see. The assessed value of the house is $3,250, and the tax rate is 2.351%. I need to find out which option is correct.

Alright, I remember that to calculate property tax, you multiply the assessed value by the tax rate. But wait, the tax rate is a percentage, so I need to convert that into a decimal first. Oh right, because percentages are per hundred, so I have to divide by 100.

So the tax rate is 2.351%, which as a decimal would be 0.02351. Got that part down. Now, the assessed value is $3,250. So I need to multiply 3250 by 0.02351. 

Let me write that out: 3250 * 0.02351. Hmm, let's do the math step by step. Maybe I'll break it down. 

First, I can think of 3250 as 3000 + 250. So 3000 multiplied by 0.02351 and then 250 multiplied by the same, and add them together.

Calculating 3000 * 0.02351. Well, 0.02351 times 1000 is 23.51, so times 3 would be 70.53. So that's 70.53 from the 3000 part.

Now the 250 part. 250 is a quarter of 1000, right? So 0.02351 * 250 is a quarter of 23.51. Let me calculate that. 23.51 divided by 4 is... 5.8775. So that's approximately 5.88.

Adding both parts together: 70.53 + 5.88 = 76.41. So the property tax should be $76.41.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should just multiply 3250 by 0.02351 directly.

Alternatively, I can compute 3250 * 0.02351. Let's do it more accurately.

First, 3250 * 0.02 is 65. Then 3250 * 0.003 is 9.75. And 3250 * 0.00051 is... let's see, 3250 * 0.0005 is 1.625, and 3250 * 0.00001 is 0.0325. So adding those: 1.625 + 0.0325 = 1.6575.

Now add all those together: 65 + 9.75 is 74.75, plus 1.6575 gives 76.4075. Oh, so approximately $76.41. That matches my earlier calculation.

Looking at the options, option C is $76.41. So that should be the correct answer.

To calculate the property tax on a house with an assessed value of $3,250 and a tax rate of 2.351%, follow these steps:

1. **Convert the tax rate to a decimal**:  
   \( 2.351\% = 0.02351 \).

2. **Multiply the assessed value by the tax rate**:  
   \( 3250 \times 0.02351 = 76.4075 \).

3. **Round the result to two decimal places**:  
   \( 76.4075 \approx 76.41 \).

Comparing this result to the given options, the correct answer is **C: $76.41**.
