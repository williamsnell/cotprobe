Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields. Hmm, let me see... I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says there's a charge with a uniform linear density along a string stretched from x=0 to x=3.0 meters. The linear density is 9.0 nC/m. I need to find the electric field at x=4.0 meters on the x-axis. Oh right, the electric field due to a charge distribution.

Wait, so the string is along the x-axis, and the charge is spread out from 0 to 3 m. The point where we're calculating the field is at x=4 m, which is beyond the end of the string. So that's important because the way the field is calculated might depend on whether the point is inside or outside the charge distribution.

I remember that for a continuous charge distribution, you can model it by breaking it into small point charges and integrating their contributions. Since the charge is uniform, the linear density (λ) is constant, which should make things easier.

The electric field from a point charge is given by E = kQ/r², where k is Coulomb's constant (like 8.99e9 N·m²/C²). But since this is a line charge, I think each infinitesimal segment contributes to the field, and we have to integrate over the entire length.

So, let me think about a small segment of the string. Let's take a tiny piece dx at position x. The charge dq on this piece would be λ dx. Then, the electric field dE due to this dq at the point x=4.0 m would be... each dq contributes a field pointing away (since it's positive, I assume, though the problem doesn't specify) or towards, but since the problem gives magnitude, maybe the sign isn't important.

Wait, right, the problem asks for the magnitude, so I just need the absolute value. So each dq contributes dE = k * dq / r², where r is the distance from the segment to the point where we're calculating the field.

In this case, the point is at x=4, and the segment is at x. So r is (4 - x), because the distance between x and 4 is 4 - x meters. Since the point is beyond the end of the string, every segment is closer than 4m. So r varies from 1m (when x=3) up to 4m (when x=0). 

So putting it all together, the total electric field E is the integral of dE from x=0 to x=3. That is, E = integral from 0 to 3 of (k * λ dx) / (4 - x)².

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, because each dq is a line segment along x, and the point is along the same line, the field from each segment is directed along the x-axis. And because all the segments are on one side of the point (x=4 is to the right of all segments from 0 to 3), all the contributions will be in the same direction. So I can just sum them up without worrying about direction, which simplifies things.

So integrating from 0 to 3.

Let me write that integral out:

E = ∫ (k * λ) / (4 - x)² dx from x=0 to x=3.

I can factor out the constants, so k*λ is outside the integral.

So E = k * λ ∫ dx/(4 - x)^2 from 0 to 3.

Now, the integral of 1/(4 - x)^2 dx. Let's think about substitution. Let u = 4 - x. Then du = -dx. So when x=0, u=4, and when x=3, u=1.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=1 of (1/u²) (-du). Flipping the limits, it's ∫ from 1 to 4 of (1/u²) du.

The integral of 1/u² is -1/u + C, so evaluating from 1 to 4:

[-1/u] from 1 to4 = (-1/4) - (-1/1) = (-1/4 + 1) = 3/4.

So the integral is 3/4.

Putting it all together: E = k * λ * (3/4).

Now plug in the numbers. Let's make sure about the units. The linear density λ is 9.0 nC/m. So 9e-9 C/m.

k is 8.99e9 N·m²/C².

So E = (8.99e9 N·m²/C²) * (9e-9 C/m) * (3/4).

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 8.99e9 multiplied by 9e-9.

8.99e9 * 9e-9 = (8.99 * 9) * (1e9 * 1e-9) = 80.91 * 1 = about 80.91.

Then multiply by 3/4: 80.91 * 0.75 = let's see... 80 * 0.75 is 60, and 0.91 * 0.75 is ~0.6825, so total is about 60.6825 N/C.

Wait, but wait, the options are given in integers. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 8.99e9 * 9e-9 = (8.99 * 9) * (1e9 * 1e-9) )= 80.91. Yeah.

80.91 * 3/4: 80.91 * 3 = 242.73; divided by 4 is 60.6825 N/C. So about 60.68 N/C.

Wait, but the options don't have 60 or 61. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A:35, B:53, C:75, D:30, E:45, F:82, G:67, H:61, I:48, J:90.

H is 61, which is close to 60.68. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Did I make any mistakes?

Wait, let me recompute 8.99e9 * 9e-9.

8.99e9 = 8.99 * 1e9.

9e-9 is 9 * 1e-9.

Multiply them: (8.99 *9 ) * (1e9 * 1e-9) = (80.91) * 1 = 80.91.

Yes, that's correct.

Then 80.91 * 3/4: 80.91 * 0.75.

Hmm, 80 * 0.75 is 60 exactly.

0.91 * 0.75: 0.6825.

So 60.6825. So approximately 60.68 N/C.

Looking at the options, H is 61, which is the closest. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I get the integral right?

The integral of 1/(4-x)^2 dx from 0 to3.

Let me set u=4-x, du=-dx. So when x=0, u=4; x=3, u=1.

So the integral becomes ∫ u=4 to u=1 (1/u²) (-du) → ∫1 to4 (1/u²) du.

Integral of u^(-2) is -u^(-1), so [ -1/u ] from 1 to4.

At u=4: -1/4. At u=1: -1/1. So (-1/4) - (-1) ) = ( -0.25 +1 ) = 0.75 = 3/4.

Yes, that's correct.

So the calculation is right, leading to approximately 60.68 N/C, so 61 N/C is option H.

To determine the magnitude of the electric field at \( x = 4.0 \, \mathrm{m} \) due to a charge with uniform linear density \( \lambda = 9.0 \, \mathrm{nC/m} \) stretched along the \( x \)-axis from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 3.0 \, \mathrm{m} \), we calculate the contributions from each infinitesimal segment of the charge distribution.

The electric field at \( x = 4.0 \, \mathrm{m} \) is given by:

\[
E = \int_0^3 \frac{k \, \lambda \, dx}{(4 - x)^2}
\]

where \( k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \) is Coulomb's constant. Factoring out constants:

\[
E = k \lambda \int_0^3 \frac{dx}{(4 - x)^2}
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - x \), \( du = -dx \), the limits change as follows:
- When \( x = 0 \), \( u = 4 \),
- When \( x = 3 \), \( u = 1 \).

The integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^1 \frac{-du}{u^2} = \int_1^4 \frac{du}{u^2}
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{u^2} \) is \( -\frac{1}{u} \), so:

\[
\int_1^4 \frac{du}{u^2} = \left[ -\frac{1}{u} \right]_1^4 = \left( -\frac{1}{4} \right) - \left( -1 \right) = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Substituting back, the electric field becomes:

\[
E = k \lambda \frac{3}{4}
\]

Plugging in the values \( k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \), \( \lambda = 9.0 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C/m} \), and \( \frac{3}{4} \):

\[
E = \left( 8.99 \times 10^9 \right) \left( 9.0 \times 10^{-9} \right) \frac{3}{4}
\]

First, calculate \( 8.99 \times 10^9 \times 9.0 \times 10^{-9} \):

\[
8.99 \times 9 = 80.91, \quad 10^9 \times 10^{-9} = 1, \quad \text{so } 8.99 \times 10^9 \times 9.0 \times 10^{-9} = 80.91
\]

Now multiply by \( \frac{3}{4} \):

\[
E = 80.91 \times \frac{3}{4} = 60.6825 \, \mathrm{N/C}
\]

The closest option to \( 60.6825 \, \mathrm{N/C} \) is \( 61 \, \mathrm{N/C} \), which corresponds to option **H**.
