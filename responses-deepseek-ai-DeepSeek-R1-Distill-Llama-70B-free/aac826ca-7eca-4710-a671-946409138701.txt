Okay, so I need to find the Fourier sine series of f(x) = x² over the interval (0, 1). Hmm, I remember that the Fourier series can be split into sine and cosine parts, but since the function is defined on (0,1), and if we're considering a sine series, it's probably an odd extension. 

Wait, the Fourier sine series is used when the function is extended as an odd function. So for f(x) defined on (0, L), the sine series would represent the odd extension over (-L, L). In this case, L is 1, so the extension is to (-1, 1). 

The general formula for the Fourier sine series is f(x) = sum from n=1 to infinity of b_n sin(nπx/L), where L is the length of the interval. Since here L=1, it's just sum b_n sin(nπx).

The coefficients b_n are calculated using b_n = (2/L) * integral from 0 to L of f(x) sin(nπx/L) dx. Again, with L=1, so b_n = 2 * ∫₀¹ x² sin(nπx) dx.

I need to compute this integral. Let's set it up: ∫x² sin(nπx) dx from 0 to 1. Integration by parts, maybe twice. Let me recall the formula for integration by parts: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du.

Let me let u = x², so du = 2x dx. dv = sin(nπx) dx, so v = -(1/(nπ)) cos(nπx).

So the first integration by parts gives:
uv from 0 to 1 minus ∫v du.

uv is -x²/(nπ) cos(nπx) evaluated from 0 to 1.

At x=1: -1²/(nπ) cos(nπ) = -1/(nπ) * (-1)^n, since cos(nπ) is (-1)^n.

At x=0: 0, because x² is zero.

So the first part is [ -1/(nπ) (-1)^n ] - 0 = (-1)^{n+1}/(nπ).

Then the integral becomes this minus ∫v du. The integral is ∫ ( -1/(nπ) cos(nπx) ) * 2x dx from 0 to1.

So that's (-2/(nπ)) ∫x cos(nπx) dx from 0 to 1.

Let me do integration by parts again on this new integral. Let u = x, du = dx. dv = cos(nπx) dx, so v = (1/(nπ)) sin(nπx).

So ∫x cos(nπx) dx = uv - ∫v du = x/(nπ) sin(nπx) - ∫ (1/(nπ)) sin(nπx) dx.

Evaluate the first term from 0 to 1. At x=1: 1/(nπ) sin(nπ) = 0, since sin(nπ) is zero. At x=0, same, zero. So that term is zero.

Now, the integral becomes - ∫ (1/(nπ)) sin(nπx) dx from 0 to1. Which is - (1/(nπ)) * [ -1/(nπ) cos(nπx) ] from 0 to1.

So that's (1/(n² π²)) [ cos(nπ) - cos(0) ] = (1/(n² π²)) [ (-1)^n - 1 ].

Putting it all together: the integral of x cos(nπx) dx is [ (1/(n² π²)) ( (-1)^n - 1 ) ].

So going back to the earlier step, the integral was (-2/(nπ)) times this. So:

(-2/(nπ)) * (1/(n² π²)) ( (-1)^n - 1 ) = (-2)/(n^3 π^3) [ (-1)^n -1 ].

Wait, let me compute that correctly. The integral after the second by parts is:

[0] - (1/(nπ)) ∫ sin(...) dx = [0] + (1/(n² π²)) [ (-1)^n -1 ].

Wait, maybe I messed up a sign. Let me retrace. The integral after the second by parts:

∫x cos(nπx) dx = 0 - ∫ (1/(nπ)) sin(nπx) dx.

Which evaluates to - (1/(nπ)) * [ -1/(nπ) cos(nπx) ] from 0 to1.

So that's (1/(n² π²)) [ cos(nπ) - 1 ].

But cos(nπ) is (-1)^n, so [ (-1)^n -1 ].

So now, going back, the second integral was (-2/(nπ)) * [ (1/(n² π²)) ( (-1)^n - 1 ) ) ].

So that's (-2/(nπ)) * ( (-1)^n -1 ) / (n² π² ) = (-2) ( (-1)^n -1 ) / (n^3 π^3 ).

So putting all together, the original integral for b_n is:

b_n = 2 [ ( (-1)^{n+1} )/(n π ) ) + ( -2 ( (-1)^n -1 ) )/(n^3 π^3 ) ) ].

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The first integration by parts gave me:

- x²/(nπ) cos(nπx) | from 0 to1, which is [ (-1)^{n+1} ]/(n π).

Then subtract the integral, which is (-2/(n π)) ∫ x cos(nπx) dx. Wait, the integral ∫x cos(...) dx was computed as (1/(n² π²)) ( (-1)^n -1 ), so the term becomes (-2/(n π)) * (1/(n² π²)) ( (-1)^n -1 ) ).

So overall, the integral for b_n is:

b_n = 2 [ ( (-1)^{n+1} )/(n π) ) + ( (-2/(n π)) * (1/(n² π²)) ( (-1)^n -1 ) ) ) ]

Wait, no. Let me write it step by step.

The first part after first integration by parts is:

[ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ) ].

Then, the second part is:

(-2/(n π)) ∫ x cos(nπx) dx.

Which is (-2/(n π)) * [ ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n² π²) ) ].

So the entire integral is:

[ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ) ] + [ (-2/(n π)) * ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n² π²) ) ]

Wait, no. Because the integral after the second by parts was (1/(n² π²))( (-1)^n -1 ), and the term we have is (-2/(n π)) * that.

So the second term is (-2/(n π)) * ( ( (-1)^n -1 ) )/(n² π² ) ) = (-2 ( (-1)^n -1 )) / (n^3 π^3).

So putting it all together, the integral is:

[ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ) ] + [ (-2 ( (-1)^n -1 )) / (n^3 π^3 ) ]

But wait, the original integral was for b_n, which is 2 times the integral. So:

b_n = 2 [ ( (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ) + ( (-2 ( (-1)^n -1 )) )/(n^3 π^3 ) ) ]

Wait, no. Let me correct that. Because the initial integral is:

b_n = 2 * [ integral result ]

So the integral result is [ term1 + term2 ].

So term1 is [ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ), term2 is [ (-2/(n π)) * (1/(n² π²)) ( (-1)^n -1 ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the entire thing step by step.

Let me compute the integral x² sin(nπx) dx.

First integration by parts:

u = x² → du=2x dx

dv = sin(nπx) dx → v = -cos(nπx)/(n π)

So ∫x² sin(...) dx = -x² cos(nπx)/(n π) + (2/(n π)) ∫x cos(nπx) dx

Evaluated from 0 to1.

First term at 1: -1² * cos(n π) / (n π) → -cos(nπ)/(n π) = - (-1)^n/(n π) → (-1)^{n+1}/(n π)

At 0, the term is 0.

So the first part is [ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ]

Now the integral left is (2/(n π)) ∫x cos(nπx) dx.

Compute this integral by parts again:

u = x → du = dx

dv = cos(nπx) dx → v = sin(nπx)/(n π)

So ∫x cos(...) dx = x sin(nπx)/(n π) - ∫ sin(nπx)/(n π) dx

Evaluated from 0 to1.

First term at 1: 1 * sin(n π)/(n π) → 0, since sin(nπ)=0.

At 0: 0 as well.

So the integral becomes - ∫ sin(nπx)/(n π) dx = - [ - cos(nπx) / (n π)^2 ) ] from 0 to1.

So that's [ cos(nπx) / (n² π²) ) ] from 0 to1 → [ cos(nπ) - cos(0) ]/(n² π²) = [ (-1)^n -1 ]/(n² π² )

So putting it all together, the integral ∫x cos(...) dx is [ (-1)^n -1 ]/(n² π² )

Now, going back to the earlier expression:

(2/(n π)) * ∫x cos(...) dx = (2/(n π)) * [ (-1)^n -1 ]/(n² π² )

= 2 [ (-1)^n -1 ] / (n^3 π^3 )

Wait, but wait: the integral of x cos(...) is [ (-1)^n -1 ]/(n² π² )

So (2/(n π)) times that is 2*( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 )

So now, the entire integral of x² sin(...) dx is:

[ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ) ] + [ 2*( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 ) )

But wait, the first term was [ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ), and the second term is (2/(n π)) * [ integral ]

Wait, no. The initial expression after the first integration by parts was:

- x² cos(nπx)/(n π) + (2/(n π)) ∫x cos(...) dx.

So the integral is [ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ) ] + (2/(n π)) * [ ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n² π^2 ) ]

So that's [ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ) ] + (2 ( (-1)^n -1 )) / (n^3 π^3 )

So the entire integral is [ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ) + 2 ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Then, the coefficient b_n is 2 times this integral, because b_n = 2 * ∫ f(x) sin(...) dx.

So,

b_n = 2 * [ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) + 2 ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Wait, no. Wait, the integral itself is the [ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ) + 2 ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

So b_n = 2 * [ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) + 2 ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Let me compute this.

First term: 2*(-1)^{n+1}/(n π) = 2*(-1)^{n}*(-1)/(n π) ) → -2*(-1)^n/(n π)

Second term: 2 * [ 2 ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 ) ) ] → 4 ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 )

So combining:

b_n = [ -2 (-1)^n/(n π) ) + 4 ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Simplify each term.

First term: -2 (-1)^n/(n π) = 2 (-1)^{n+1}/(n π )

Second term: 4 ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 ) = 4 [ (-1)^n -1 ]/(n^3 π^3 )

Hmm, perhaps factor out (-1)^n:

Wait, let me factor the terms.

Alternatively, maybe express in terms of (-1)^{n+1}.

Let me compute the first term: 2 (-1)^{n+1}/(n π )

Second term: 4 ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 ) = 4 [ (-1)^n -1 ]/(n^3 π^3 )

So, the entire expression for b_n is:

b_n = 2 (-1)^{n+1}/(n π ) + 4 [ (-1)^n -1 ]/(n^3 π^3 )

Perhaps I can factor out 2/(n π) from the first term and 2/(n^3 π^3) from the second?

Wait, let me see the options. The options have terms like [ (-1)^n+1 ]/(n π) and [4/(n^3 π^3)] or similar.

Looking at option F: x^2 ~ sum [ ( (-1)^{n+1} / (n π) ) + ( 2 [1 - (-1)^n ] )/(n^3 π^3) ) ] sin(nπx). Wait, but wait, let me compute it.

Wait, let's rearrange the terms.

b_n = [2 (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ] + [4 ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Let me factor the 2:

= 2 [ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ) + 2 ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Hmm, perhaps express the second term as 2*( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 )

Alternatively, let me write the entire expression:

b_n = [ (-1)^{n+1} * 2/(n π) ) ] + [4 ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Wait, perhaps factor (-1)^n:

= [ 2 (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ) ] + [4 ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Let me factor out (-1)^n from the first term:

= (-1)^n [ -2/(n π) ) ] + 4 ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 )

Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps write the second term as:

4 [ (-1)^n -1 ] = 4 [ (-1)^n + (-1) ].

Wait, maybe express in terms of [1 - (-1)^n ]?

Let me compute the second term:

4 ( (-1)^n -1 ) = -4 (1 - (-1)^n )

So the second term becomes:

-4 (1 - (-1)^n )/(n^3 π^3 )

So b_n = 2 (-1)^{n+1}/(n π ) -4 (1 - (-1)^n )/(n^3 π^3 )

Factor 2:

= 2 [ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π ) - 2 (1 - (-1)^n )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Hmm, let me look at the options again.

Option F is:

x^2 ~ sum [ ( (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ) + 2 [1 - (-1)^n ]/(n^3 π^3) ) ] sin(nπx)

Wait, but in our expression, it's 2 times [ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ) - 2 (1 - (-1)^n )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs. Let me re-express.

Wait, let's calculate each term again.

Original integral:

b_n = 2 * [ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) + 2 ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Expanding:

= 2*(-1)^{n+1}/(n π) + 4 ( (-1)^n -1 )/(n^3 π^3 )

Let me write this as:

= [ 2*(-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ) ] + [4*(-1)^n -4 ]/(n^3 π^3 )

= [ -2*(-1)^n/(n π) ) ] + [4*(-1)^n -4 ]/(n^3 π^3 )

Factor terms with (-1)^n:

= (-1)^n [ -2/(n π) + 4/(n^3 π^3 ) ] + [ -4/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for the pattern in the options.

Option F: terms are [ (-1)^{n+1}/(n π) ) + 2 [1 - (-1)^n ]/(n^3 π^3 ) ]

Let me compute
