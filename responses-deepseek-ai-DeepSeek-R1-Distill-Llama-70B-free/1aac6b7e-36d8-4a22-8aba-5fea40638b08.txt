Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

An elderly woman was mugged and robbed on a public street. At the time of the offense, the victim only saw her assailant's eyes. A hooded sweatshirt and bandana concealed the rest of his face. A few days later, while the victim waited to be interviewed, she observed the defendant being escorted through the courthouse, in jail clothing, and restrained by handcuffs and leg irons. She identified him as the perpetrator shortly thereafter. Will the court allow that identification into evidence?

Options:

A: No, because the defendant was restrained which could have influenced the victim's identification.
B: Yes, the identification is allowed into evidence regardless of the circumstances.
C: Yes, because the victim had a few days to recall the perpetrator's eyes.
D: Yes, because the witness' recognition of someone is all that is needed; the reliability or credibility of it is subject to cross examination.
E: No, because prior statements of identification are considered hearsay and never allowed into evidence.
F: Yes, if the witness perceived the perpetrator by seeing his eyes, and made the identification on that basis it was reliable enough to be admitted.
G: No, because it is not reliable enough and there was too much suggestion to make a reasonably accurate identification.
H: Yes, because the defendant was in jail clothing, which suggests he is the perpetrator.
I: No, because the victim was under stress at the time of the offense, which could have affected her identification.
J: No, because the victim should have identified the perpetrator immediately after the offense.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically regarding the admissibility of a witness's identification of a defendant. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The scenario is that an elderly woman was mugged. At the time, she only saw her assailant's eyes because the rest of his face was covered by a hooded sweatshirt and a bandana. A few days later, she's at the courthouse waiting to be interviewed and sees the defendant being escorted. He's in jail clothes and restrained with handcuffs and leg irons. She then identifies him as the perpetrator. The question is whether this identification will be allowed into evidence.

I remember from my studies that eyewitness identification can be tricky because of issues like suggestibility and reliability. There are specific legal standards, especially regarding lineups and showups, which are procedures where a witness identifies a suspect.

In this case, the identification didn't happen in a lineup or a showup procedure. Instead, the victim saw the defendant in the courthouse while he was in custody. That raises some red flags because seeing someone in handcuffs and jail clothes might suggest to the witness that this person is the suspect, even if they're not sure. That's called suggestive circumstances.

I think about the case law, like the Biggers factors, which are used to determine the reliability of an identification. The factors include how good a look the witness got, the length of time between the crime and identification, any discrepancies in the description, the witness's level of attention, the suggestiveness of the procedure, and the confidence of the witness.

Here, the victim only saw the eyes, which might limit the reliability. Also, the fact that she saw him a few days later in a suggestive setting (in custody) could make the identification unreliable. Courts are concerned about such situations because the surroundings might unduly influence the witness's memory.

Looking at the options, option A says no because the defendant was restrained, which could influence the identification. That makes sense because the restraints and jail clothes could suggest guilt. Option D suggests that the identification is allowed because recognition is enough, and reliability is tested on cross-examination. But I think the court would exclude it if the procedure was unduly suggestive, regardless of whether cross-examination can address credibility.

Option F says yes because she saw his eyes and relied on that. But even if she saw his eyes, the suggestive setting might still make the identification inadmissible. Option G argues it's not reliable due to suggestion. That aligns with my earlier thought about the Biggers factors, where the procedure's suggestiveness impacts reliability.

Option H suggests jail clothes indicate guilt, which seems a bit off because clothing doesn't necessarily make someone guilty, but it's a suggestive factor. Option I brings up stress during the offense affecting memory, which is a factor, but maybe not the main issue here compared to the suggestive setting.

Option E is about hearsay, but prior identification isn't hearsay when the witness testifies about it, so E is incorrect. Option B is too broad, saying it's allowed regardless of circumstances, which isn't true. Option J is about immediate identification, but that's not a strict requirement.

So, putting it together, the key issue is the suggestive circumstances of the identification. The court would likely find that the identification was made under conditions that were too suggestive, making it unreliable and therefore inadmissible. So the answer should be that the court doesn't allow it, pointing to the suggestiveness.

Looking again, option G says no because it's not reliable and there was too much suggestion. That matches my conclusion. Alternatively, option A focuses on being restrained, which is part of the suggestiveness. But I think the broader issue is the entire setting being suggestive, not just the restraints. So maybe option G is more accurate.

Wait, but in some cases, even a single-suspect showup can be allowed if there's an emergency, but here it's a few days later without such circumstances. So the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive. Therefore, the court would exclude it under the Biggers factors, making option G the correct answer.

The admissibility of the victim's identification hinges on the reliability of the process under the Biggers factors, which assess the suggestiveness of the circumstances. Here, the victim identified the defendant in a courthouse while he was in custody, wearing jail clothing and restrained. These conditions are unduly suggestive, as they imply guilt and could influence the victim's memory, undermining the reliability of the identification. 

Option G correctly identifies that the identification is not reliable due to the high suggestiveness of the setting, making it inadmissible. Other options either overlook the impact of suggestive circumstances or misapply legal principles regarding hearsay or the sufficiency of recognition. Therefore, the court would exclude the identification based on the unreliable and suggestive conditions under which it was made.

Answer: G
