Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the theoretical density of sodium which crystallizes in a body-centered cubic structure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, first, I remember that density is mass over volume, right? But wait, for crystals, it's the density of the unit cell. Oh right, the formula is density (d) equals (Z * M) / (N_A * a^3), where Z is the number of atoms per unit cell, M is molar mass, N_A is Avogadro's number, and a is the lattice parameter.

Wait, sodium has a body-centered cubic structure. So for BCC, Z is 2. Because in a BCC, there's one atom at each corner and one in the center. Oh yeah, corners contribute 1/8 each, so 8 corners make 8*(1/8)=1 atom, and the center is 1, so total of 2 atoms per unit cell.

Next, the a given is 4.24 Å. Oh wait, I need to convert that to meters. Angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so a = 4.24e-10 m.

Molar mass of sodium (Na). Sodium's atomic weight is about 22.99 g/mol, I think. So M is 22.99 g/mol. But wait, the units need to be in kg for the density to be in kg/m³. So converting grams to kg, M becomes 0.02299 kg/mol.

Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 mol⁻¹.

Putting it all together. So d = (Z * M) / (N_A * a³).

Let me plug in the numbers. Z is 2. M is 0.02299 kg/mol. N_A is 6.022e23. a is 4.24e-10 m.

Wait, let me compute a³ first. 4.24e-10 cubed is (4.24)^3 multiplied by (1e-10)^3. 4.24^3 is about 4 * 4 *4 is 64, but more accurately, 4.24 * 4.24 = let's see, 4*4=16, 4*.24= .96, .24*4= .96, .24*.24=0.0576. So (4+0.24)^2= 4.24² = 17.9776. Then, 17.9776 *4.24. Let me calculate 17.9776 *4: 71.9104, 17.9776 *0.24 = approx 4.315. So total is around 76.225. So 4.24³ is about 76.225, so a³ is 76.225e-30 m³, since (1e-10)^3 is 1e-30.

Wait, no, 4.24e-10^3 is (4.24)^3 * (1e-10)^3 = 76.225 * 1e-30 = 7.6225e-29 m³? Wait, wait: 4.24e-10 m is the a. So a^3 = (4.24)^3 * (1e-10)^3 = 76.225 * 1e-30 = 7.6225e-29 m³. Wait, no, 1e-10 cubed is 1e-30, yes.

So now, Z*M is 2 * 0.02299 kg/mol = 0.04598 kg/mol.

N_A * a^3 is 6.022e23 * 7.6225e-29 m³. Let me compute that. 6.022e23 *7.6225e-29 = (6.022 *7.6225) * 1e-6.

6 *7 is 42, 6*0.6225 is about 3.735. 0.022 *7.6225 is about 0.1677. Hmm, maybe better to compute 6.022 *7.6225.

Let me compute 6 *7.6225 =45.735, 0.022 *7.6225=0.1677. So total is approximately 45.735 +0.1677=45.9027. So about 45.9027e-6. So 45.9027e-6 = 4.59027e-5.

So the denominator is 4.59027e-5 m³·mol⁻¹.

So density d = numerator (0.04598 kg/mol) divided by denominator (4.59027e-5 m³·mol⁻¹). Wait, the units: (kg/mol) / (m³·mol⁻¹) )= kg/m³.

So 0.04598 / 4.59027e-5 = let's compute that.

0.04598 divided by 4.59027e-5 is the same as 0.04598 / 0.0000459027.

Let me calculate that. 0.04598 / 0.0000459027 ≈ 1000. Let me compute more accurately.

0.04598 ÷ 0.0000459027 = (4598e-5) / (4590.27e-5) )= 4598 /4590.27 ≈ 1.0016. So approximately 1001.6 kg/m³.

Wait, that can't be right because sodium is a pretty light metal. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation steps. Let me recheck.

Wait, a is 4.24 Å, which is 4.24e-10 m.

a³ = (4.24e-10)^3 = 76.2 * (1e-30) = 7.62e-29 m³.

Wait, no: 4.24e-10 m is 4.24 x 1e-10. So (4.24)^3 is 76.2, and (1e-10)^3 is 1e-30, so a³=76.2e-30 m³ = 7.62e-29 m³.

So N_A * a³ = 6.022e23 *7.62e-29 = let me compute that.

6.022e23 *7.62e-29 = 6.022 *7.62 *1e(23-29) = 45.878 *1e-6 = 4.5878e-5 m³/mol.

So denominator is 4.5878e-5 m³/mol.

Numerator is Z*M = 2 * 0.02299 kg/mol = 0.04598 kg/mol.

So d = 0.04598 / 4.5878e-5 = let's compute 0.04598 divided by 0.000045878.

Hmm, 0.04598 / 0.000045878 ≈ 1002 kg/m³.

Wait, that's higher than water, which is 1000 kg/m³. But sodium's density is actually around 0.97 g/cm³, which is 970 kg/m³. Oh wait, I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, wait! Oh no, I think I made a mistake in converting grams to kg. Oh wait, M is 22.99 g/mol. So 22.99 g/mol is 0.02299 kg/mol. That part was correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the a³ calculation. 4.24e-10 m is correct. a³ is (4.24e-10)^3 = (4.24)^3 * 1e-30. 4.24^3 is 4.24 *4.24=17.97, then *4.24 again: 17.97*4.24. Let's compute 17*4=68, 17*0.24=4.08, 0.97*4=3.88, 0.97*0.24=0.2328. Hmm, perhaps better to compute exactly:

17.97 *4.24:

Multiply 17.97 by 4: 71.88.

17.97 * 0.24: 4.3108.

So 71.88 +4.3108 =76.1908, so a³ is 76.1908e-30 m³, which is 7.61908e-29 m³.

So N_A *a³ is 6.022e23 *7.61908e-29 = 6.022 *7.61908 *1e-6.

6.022 *7.61908: Let's compute 6 *7.619=45.714, 0.022 *7.619=0.1676. So total 45.8816.

So 45.8816e-6 m³/mol.

Then, Z*M = 2 * 0.02299 kg/mol = 0.04598 kg/mol.

So density d = 0.04598 kg/mol / (45.8816e-6 m³/mol) )= 0.04598 / 4.58816e-5.

Wait, 0.04598 divided by 0.0000458816 equals approximately 1002 kg/m³.

But wait, sodium's actual density is about 0.97 g/cm³, which is 970 kg/m³. So a little over 1000 kg/m³. But the options don't have that. Looking at the options, option B is 0.97e3 kg/m³, which is 970. Option I is 1.5e3, which is 1500. So my calculation gives around 1000, but the closest option is B, but that's 0.97e3, which is about 970.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Maybe I made an error in the a³ calculation.

Wait another approach: Let me compute in cm because sometimes using cm makes the units easier. Because 1 m³ is 1e6 liter, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of cm.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should re-calculate using different units to see if I get the same result.

Alternatively, let me compute the volume in cm³. Because 1 m = 1e2 cm, so 1 m³ = (1e2 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³.

But perhaps I should stick to SI units.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the a conversion. Let me double-check.

a is 4.24 Å, which is 4.24e-10 m. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the density formula again step by step.

d = (Z * M) / (N_A * a^3).

Z=2, M=0.02299 kg/mol, N_A=6.022e23, a=4.24e-10 m.

So a^3 = (4.24e-10)^3 = 4.24^3 * 1e-30.

4.24^3: 4.24 *4.24 = 17.9776; 17.9776 *4.24 = let me compute this accurately.

17 *4=68, 17*.24=4.08; 0.9776*4=3.9104; 0.9776*0.24=0.2346.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 17.9776 *4.24:

17.9776 *4 =71.9104

17.9776 *0.2 =3.59552

17.9776 *0.04 =0.719104

17.9776 *0.00=0

Adding those up: 71.9104 +3.59552=75.50592 +0.719104=76.225024.

So a^3 =76.225024e-30 m³ =7.6225024e-29 m³.

N_A * a³ =6.022e23 *7.6225024e-29 = (6.022 *7.6225024) * 1e(23-29) = (45.88) *1e-6 ≈4.588e-5 m³/mol.

Z*M =2 *0.02299=0.04598 kg/mol.

So d =0.04598 / 4.588e-5 = let's compute this division.

0.04598 / 0.00004588.

Let me write it as 4598e-5 / 4588e-5 =4598/4588 ≈1.0022.

So d≈1.0022e3 kg/m³, which is approximately 1002 kg/m³.

But the options don't have 1002. The closest option is B:0.97e3 (970) and I:1.5e3 (1500). So 1002 isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass. Let me check: Sodium's molar mass is about 22.99 g/mol, so that's correct.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of a^3.

Wait another approach: compute the volume of a unit cell in cm³, then compute density.

Because 1 Å =1e-8 cm. So a =4.24 Å =4.24e-8 cm.

So a^3 = (4.24e-8 cm)^3 = (4.24)^3 * 1e-24 cm³ =76.225 *1e-24 =7.6225e-23 cm³.

Now, using density formula in g/cm³: d = (Z*M)/(N_A * a^3) * (conversion factors).

Wait, M in g/mol, a in cm, N_A is per mol.

So, Z=2, M=22.99 g/mol, N_A=6.022e23, a^3=7.6225e-23 cm³.

So d = (2 *22.99) / (6.022e23 *7.6225e-23) )= 45.98 / (4.588e1) )=45.98 /45.88 ≈1.002 g/cm³.

Oh wait, 1.002 g/cm³ is 1002 kg/m³, same as before. So that's correct, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait the options are:

A: 2.50 × 10^3 kg m^-3 → 2500

B: 0.97 × 10^3 →970

C:0.50e3 →500

D:1.20e3 →1200

E:1.75e3 →1750

F:2.00e3 →2000

G:0.80e3 →800

H:1.00e3 →1000

I:1.50e3 →1500

J:0.65e3 →650

Wait, the correct answer according to calculation is approximately 1002 kg/m³. But the option H is 1.00e3, which is 1000. But my calculation gives ~1002. So H is the closest, but I thought sodium's density is around 0.97 g/cm³. Wait wait, what's the actual density of sodium?

I think sodium's actual density is about 0.97 g/cm³, which is 970 kg/m³. So why is my calculation giving 1002?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the a value. The question says a=4.24 Å. Let me check what's the correct lattice parameter for sodium.

Wait, I think sodium's lattice parameter is around 4.29 Å or similar. But the question gives a=4.24 Å, so I have to go with that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again.

Density d = (Z*M) / (N_A * a³) → correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the unit conversion is a problem. Wait, when a is in meters, a³ is in m³. So everything should be in SI units.

Wait, let me recalculate using precise values.

Compute a³: (4.24e-10 m)³ = (4.24)^3 * 1e-30 m³.

4.24^3: 4^3=64, 0.24^3=0.013824. But the exact value is 76.225, as calculated before.

So a³=76.225e-30 m³ =7.6225e-29 m³.

N_A * a³ =6.022e23 *7.6225e-29 = let's compute 6.022 *7.6225 first.

6 *7 =42, 6 *0.6225=3.735, 0.022*7=0.154, 0.022*0.6225=0.013665. So 42 +3.735=45.735 +0.154=45.889 +0.013665=45.902665.

So 45.902665e-6 m³/mol.

Z*M =2 * 22.99 g/mol =45.98 g/mol =0.04598 kg/mol.

So d=0.04598 kg/mol / 45.902665e-6 m³/mol = 0.04598 /4.5902665e-5.

Compute that division.

0.04598 ÷ 0.000045902665 = let's compute.

Divide numerator and denominator by 0.00001: 459.8 /4.5902665 ≈ 100. So approximately 1000 kg/m³.

But wait, the actual density of sodium is about 0.97 g/cm³, which is 970 kg/m³. So where's the discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps I used the wrong a value. Wait the given a is 4.24 Å, but I think sodium's actual a is about 4.29 Å. Let me check the actual lattice parameter of sodium. Oh, wait, in reality, sodium has a lattice parameter of approximately 4.29 Å, so with a=4.29 Å, the density would be lower.

But according to the question, a is given as 4.24 Å, so I have to proceed with that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of a³. Let me recompute a³ correctly.

a =4.24 Å =4.24e-10 m.

a^3
