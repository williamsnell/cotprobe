Okay, so I'm trying to solve this thermodynamics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these concepts yet. But I'll give it a shot. Let me read the question again.

The question has two parts, a) and b). Both ask about the amount of work required under certain conditions, assuming perfect thermodynamic efficiency. 

Starting with part a): It says, to freeze 100g of water at 0°C when the surroundings are at 25°C. Hmm. So freezing water... I remember that when you freeze water, you're removing heat from it. But since it's already at 0°C, I think you don't need to change its temperature, just turn it into ice. 

Wait, but wait. The process of freezing requires removing the latent heat of fusion. So the formula for the heat removed (Q) would be mass times the latent heat of fusion (Lf). The latent heat of fusion for water is 334 J/g, if I recall correctly. So 100 grams would be 0.1 kg, which is 100 grams. So Q = 100g * 334 J/g = 33,400 J, which is 33.4 kJ. But wait, the question is about work required, right?

Wait, right, because this is a refrigeration process. So when you're moving heat from a colder place to a hotter place (like freezing something), you need to do work. Oh right, it's a heat pump or refrigerator scenario. The formula for the coefficient of performance (COP) for a refrigerator is COP = Tc / (Th - Tc), where Tc is the temperature of the cold reservoir and Th is the hot reservoir. But wait, in this case, the surroundings are at 25°C, which is higher than the water's 0°C. So the heat is being pumped from the cold reservoir (0°C) to the hot reservoir (25°C). 

But wait, no, the question is about freezing the water, so it's extracting heat from the water (at 0°C) and dumping it into the surroundings (25°C). So the COP for the refrigerator would be COP = Tc / (Th - Tc). But temperatures must be in Kelvin. So 0°C is 273.15 K, and 25°C is 298.15 K.

So COP = 273.15 / (298.15 - 273.15) = 273.15 / 25 ≈ 10.926. So the COP is about 10.926. 

The work done (W) is related to the heat removed (Qc) by W = Qc / COP. Wait, no, wait. The COP is defined as Qc / W. So Qc = COP * W. So rearranged, W = Qc / COP. 

Wait, no, wait again. Let me think. The COP is the amount of heat moved per unit work. So Qc = COP * W. To get W, you have W = Qc / COP. 

So Qc is 33,400 J, COP is approximately 10.926. So W = 33400 / 10.926 ≈ let's compute that. 33400 divided by 10.926. Let me approximate: 10.926 is about 10.93. So 33400 / 10.93 ≈ 3050 J? Wait, 10.93 times 3050 is 33,343. So that's close to 33400. So W ≈ 3050 J, which is 3.05 kJ. 

Looking at the options, option E has a) 3.07 kJ, which is very close to my calculation. So that's part a) done.

Now part b): To withdraw the same amount of heat from a body at 1e-5 K when the surroundings is 1 K. Wait, same amount as part a), which was 33,400 J? So we're removing 33,400 J from a body at 1e-5 K, surroundings at 1 K. 

Wait a second, that's a very low temperature. The body is at 1e-5 K, and the surroundings are at 1 K. So the heat pump must work to transfer heat from the cold body (1e-5 K) to the hot surroundings (1 K). 

But wait, the formula for the maximum efficiency (COP) again applies here. But wait, wait, is this a refrigerator or a heat pump? In this case, since we're extracting heat from a cold body and expelling it to a warmer surroundings, it's a refrigerator scenario again. So the COP would be Tc / (Th - Tc), but wait, here Tc is 1e-5 K and Th is 1 K. 

So Tc = 1e-5 K, Th = 1 K. So Th - Tc is 0.99999 K, approximately 1 K. So COP = (1e-5) / (1 - 1e-5) ≈ 1e-5 / 1, which is about 1e-5. 

Wait, that's a very small COP. So the work required would be W = Qc / COP. Qc is 33,400 J, COP is 1e-5. So W = 33400 / 1e-5 = 3.34e8 J? Wait, that's 334,000,000 J, which is 334,000 kJ or 3.34e5 kJ. 

Looking at the options, part b) for each choice. Let's check each option's part b:

Option A: 1e5 kJ → 100,000 kJ. Not close to 334,000.

Option B: 66.5e5 → 6,650,000 kJ. No, way higher.

Option C: 1e4 → 10,000. No.

Option D: 2.07e5 → 207,000. Hmm, lower than my 334,000.

Option E: 33.6e5 → 3,360,000 kJ. No, way higher.

Option F: 8.31e5 → 831,000. No.

Option G: 5e5 → 500,000. My calculation is 334,000, which isn't exactly in any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the COP calculation. Let me double-check the approach.

Wait, another approach: The maximum efficiency is given by the Carnot cycle, so for a refrigerator, the COP is Tc/(Th-Tc). So Tc is 1e-5 K, Th is 1 K. So Th-Tc is 0.99999 K.

So COP = (1e-5) / (0.99999) ≈ 1e-5. So the W is Qc / COP = 33400 / 1e-5 = 3.34e8 J, which is 334,000,000 J, which is 334,000 kJ.

Wait, looking at the options, none exactly match this. Hmm. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: a)3.07, b)1e5 → 100,000 → not 334,000.

B: a)6.01, b)66.5e5 → 6,650,000.

D: a)8.34, b)2.07e5 → 207,000.

E: a)3.07, b)33.6e5 →3,360,000.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake because I assumed that Qc is the same as in part a). Oh wait, the question says "to withdraw the same amount of heat from a body at..." So yes, same Q as part a), 33,400 J.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the COP is calculated differently. Let me re-calculate COP.

COP = Tc/(Th - Tc) → Tc is 1e-5, Th is 1.

So Th - Tc = 1 - 1e-5 = 0.99999 K.

COP = (1e-5) / 0.99999 ≈ 1e-5.

So W = 33400 J / 1e-5 = 3.34e8 J = 334,000 kJ.

But looking at the options, none have 334,000 kJ for part b. Wait, let me see the options again. Option E's part b is 33.6e5, which is 3,360,000 kJ. That's ten times more than my calculation. Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for the temperatures. Oh wait, no, both temperatures are in Kelvin. So that's not it.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the question is about a heat engine instead of a refrigerator? No, because we're moving heat from a cold to hot reservoir, so it's a refrigerator.

Wait, perhaps I should use a different formula for the work. Alternatively, maybe the heat extracted is Qc, and the work W is given by Qc * (Th)/(Tc). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think about the first law of thermodynamics for a refrigerator. The work done is W = Q_h - Q_c. But Q_h = Q_c + W. But also, for Carnot, Q_h / Q_c = Th / Tc. So substituting, Q_h = Q_c * (Th / Tc). So W = Q_c*(Th/Tc - 1).

Wait, maybe that's a better approach. So W = Q_c * (Th / Tc - 1).

Let me compute that. Th is 1 K, Tc is 1e-5 K.

So Th/Tc = 1 / 1e-5 = 1e5.

So W = Q_c * (1e5 - 1) ≈ Q_c * 1e5.

Since Q_c is 33,400 J, W = 33400 * 1e5 = 3.34e9 J. Wait, that's 3,340,000,000 J, which is 3.34e9 J, which is 3,340,000 kJ. Which is way higher than any of the options. So that can't be right. Wait, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, no, wait. Because for a refrigerator, the COP is Tc/(Th - Tc) = 1e-5/(1 - 1e-5) ≈ 1e-5. So W = Qc / COP = Qc * (Th - Tc)/Tc.

Wait, yes, that's another way to write it. So W = Qc * (Th - Tc) / Tc.

So substituting the numbers: Qc is 33,400 J, Th is 1 K, Tc is 1e-5 K. So Th - Tc = 0.99999 K.

So W = 33400 * (0.99999) / (1e-5) ≈ 33400 * 1e5 ≈ 3.34e9 J. Which is 3,340,000 kJ. Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options either. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Wait, another approach: The work done in a Carnot refrigerator is W = Qc * (Th / Tc - 1). Wait, let me see. Because COP = Qc / W = Tc/(Th - Tc). So W = Qc * (Th - Tc)/Tc.

Which is the same as I did before. So that gives W = 334e3 * (Th - Tc)/Tc = 334e3 * (1 - 1e-5)/1e-5 ≈ 334e3 * (1 / 1e-5) → 334e3 * 1e5 = 3.34e8 J. Which is 334,000 kJ. 

But looking at the options, none of the part b's are 334,000. So perhaps I made a mistake in reading the problem. Let me read the question again.

Ah, wait! The question says part b) is to withdraw the same amount of heat as in part a). So yes, same 33,400 J. So the calculation is correct. So where is the option with part a) 3.07 kJ and part b) 334,000 kJ? Looking at the choices:

Looking at option E: a) 3.07 kJ, b) 33.6e5 kJ → 3,360,000 kJ. That's ten times what I calculated.

Option J: a)33.6, b)3.07e5 → 307,000. Which is close to my 334,000 but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the COP. Maybe I should be more precise.

COP = Tc/(Th - Tc) = (1e-5 K) / (1 K - 1e-5 K) = 1e-5 / (0.99999) ≈ 1.00001e-5. So approximately 1e-5.

So W = Qc / COP = 33400 J / 1e-5 → 3.34e8 J, which is 334,000 kJ.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option E's part b) 33.6e5 kJ, but that's 3,360,000 kJ. Hmm, that's ten times higher than my calculation. Why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in reading the temperatures. Let me check. The body is at 1e-5 K, surroundings at 1 K. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, like considering the work as Qc * ln(Th/Tc) or something else. No, that doesn't make sense because for a Carnot cycle, the COP is as we calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about a heat engine rather than a refrigerator. But no, because you're extracting heat from a cold reservoir and expelling to hot, which is a refrigerator.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it again.

COP = Tc/(Th - Tc) = (1e-5) / (1 - 1e-5) ≈ 1e-5.

So W = 33,400 J / 1e-5 = 3.34e8 J → 334,000 kJ.

But looking at the options, none have 334,000 kJ. So perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the question expects me to use a different approach, like assuming the process is isothermal or something else, but that doesn't make sense in this context.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the question is considering the work done as the heat expelled, which would be Q_h = Qc + W. But that wouldn't change the calculation because W is still Qc / COP.

Hmm. Maybe the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Let me review the options again.

Looking at option E: part a) 3.07 kJ, which matches my calculation for part a). Part b) is 33.6e5 kJ, which is 3,360,000 kJ. That's ten times my value.

Wait, perhaps I misplaced a decimal point. Let me recheck. Oh wait, Qc is 33,400 J, which is 3.34e4 J. So W = 3.34e4 / 1e-5 = 3.34e9 J? No, wait, 3.34e4 / 1e-5 = 3.34e4 * 1e5 = 3.34e9 J → 3,340,000 kJ.

Hmm, but that's way higher than any option given. So I'm confused. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the work to be calculated differently, perhaps using the formula W = Qc * (1/(COP)), but I'm confident that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the COP. Let me compute it more accurately. Tc = 1e-5 K, Th = 1 K.

COP = Tc/(Th - Tc) = (1e-5)/(1 - 1e-5) = 1e-5 / 0.99999 ≈ 1.00001e-5 → approximately 1.00001e-5.

So W = 33400 / 1.00001e-5 ≈ 33400 * 1e5 → 3.34e9 J → 3,340,000 kJ.

Wait, but none of the options match that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in different units. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option E, part b is 33.6e5 kJ → 3,360,000 kJ, which is about ten times less than my calculation. Hmm, 3.34e9 J is 3,340,000 kJ. Option E's part b is 3.36e5 kJ, which is 336,000 kJ, not 3.34e6. Wait, no, 33.6e5 is 3,360,000 kJ. Oh, wait, 33.6 times 1e5 is 3,360,000. So that's 3.36e6 kJ. But my calculation is 3.34e6 kJ. That's very close, considering possible rounding.

Wait, perhaps I should be precise. Let me calculate the exact COP.

COP = Tc / (Th - Tc) = (1e-5) / (1 - 1e-5) = 1e-5 / 0.99999 = approx 1.0000100001e-5.

So W = 33400 J / 1.00001e-5 = 33400 / 0.0000100001 = let's compute that.

33400 / 0.0000100001 = 33400 / 1.0001e-5 = (33400 / 1.0001) ) * 1e5.

33400 / 1.0001 ≈ 33393.35.

So 33393.35 * 1e5 = 3,339,335,000 J → 3,339,335 kJ.

Which is approximately 3.34e6 kJ. So about 3,340,000 kJ.

Looking back at the options, option E's part b) is
