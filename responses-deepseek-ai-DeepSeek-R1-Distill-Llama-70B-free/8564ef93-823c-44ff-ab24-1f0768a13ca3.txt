Okay, so I've got this question about work design theories, and I'm a bit new to the topic, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which theoretical perspective focuses on enhancing job satisfaction and productivity. The options are A through J.

First, I remember that there are several theories related to work design. Let me try to recall them. I think Scientific Management, which was like the old Taylorism approach, focused more on efficiency and breaking tasks into smaller parts. That doesn't seem to focus on job satisfaction as much, more on productivity through standardization.

Then there's the Human Relations theory, which I believe emphasizes the social aspects of work. It probably considers factors like employee relationships and morale, which can tie into job satisfaction. But I'm not sure if that's the primary focus here.

Job enlargement and job enrichment are terms I've heard before. Job enlargement, I think, refers to increasing the number of tasks an employee does, making the job broader. Job enrichment, on the other hand, is about adding more depth to the job, maybe giving more autonomy or responsibility. Both might contribute to job satisfaction, but I'm not certain which one is the exact answer here.

There's also the Job Characteristics Model, which rings a bell. I think this model outlines core job dimensions like variety, autonomy, and feedback that influence motivation and satisfaction. So that might be related.

The Socio-technical systems approach considers both the technical and social aspects of work. It's more about optimizing the interaction between people and technology, which can improve productivity but I'm not sure it's the direct answer here.

Motivational theory is a broad term and could encompass various theories like Maslow's hierarchy or Herzberg's two-factor theory. Herzberg's theory talks about motivators like recognition and responsibility, which tie into job enrichment.

Process improvement and time and motion study seem more related to efficiency and productivity rather than job satisfaction. Time and motion studies are part of scientific management, I think.

The Techno-structural change model, I'm not too familiar with, but it sounds like it deals with structural changes in organizations, maybe through technology. Not sure how that ties directly to job satisfaction.

So, putting it all together. The question is about enhancing both satisfaction and productivity. The Job Characteristics Model (option J) seems to fit because it's about designing jobs to have certain characteristics that make them more motivating and satisfying. Job enrichment (option C) is a part of this, but I think the broader model is the Job Characteristics Model.

Wait, but sometimes job enrichment is considered part of the Job Characteristics Model. So maybe the answer is J.

Alternatively, the Human Relations theory (A) focuses on social aspects but might not directly tie into productivity as a key characteristic. So I'm leaning towards J, the Job Characteristics Model, as the correct answer.

The question asks which theoretical perspective of work design emphasizes enhancing both job satisfaction and productivity. After considering various theories:

- **Scientific Management (G)** focuses on efficiency and standardization, not satisfaction.
- **Human Relations theory (A)** emphasizes social aspects but isn't the direct answer.
- **Job enlargement (D)** and **job enrichment (C)** both contribute to satisfaction but are components of a broader model.
- **Job Characteristics Model (J)** outlines core dimensions like variety and autonomy that directly influence satisfaction and productivity.
- Other options like **Socio-technical systems (H)** and **Motivational theory (I)** are broader or less specific.

The **Job Characteristics Model (J)** is the best fit as it specifically addresses enhancing both satisfaction and productivity through job design.

Answer: J
