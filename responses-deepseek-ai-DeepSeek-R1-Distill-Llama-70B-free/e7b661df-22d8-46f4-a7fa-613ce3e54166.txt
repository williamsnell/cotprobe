Okay, so I've got this question here about the case of the former Soviet Union and how it relates to Kerr et al.'s 1960 claim. Hmm, I remember that Kerr, along with others like Dunlop and Harbison, wrote about industrialism and its impact on society. Their theory probably connects industrialization with certain political structures.

The question is asking which option supports Kerr et al.'s claim based on the Soviet Union example. Let me think about what Kerr et al. argued. From what I recall, they suggested that industrialization leads to a certain convergence in political systems. They might have said that as societies industrialize, they tend to move towards more similar structures, maybe more pluralistic or technocratic.

Wait, no, actually, Kerr and his colleagues proposed that industrialization leads to the development of a industrial society, which requires a certain set of structures. They thought that industrialized societies, whether capitalist or communist, would converge towards similar organizational forms. So, for example, both would have a more centralized, efficient system, perhaps with a strong managerial or technocratic class.

Now, considering the Soviet Union, it was a totalitarian regime. The question is about how advanced industrial technology affected its power. So, looking at the options:

Option A says advanced industrial tech strengthens totalitarian regimes. That might make sense because having advanced tech could mean better surveillance, control, and efficiency in maintaining power.

Option G is similar, saying totalitarian regimes maintain power with advanced tech. So both A and G seem related.

But wait, Kerr et al.'s argument was more about the convergence, right? So perhaps industrialization would lead to a more technocratic society, which might be more efficient but not necessarily strengthen a totalitarian regime. Alternatively, maybe their idea was that industrial society requires a certain type of leadership, perhaps a ruling elite.

Looking at the options again:

Option I says totalitarian regimes are incompatible with advanced industrial tech. But the Soviet Union did industrialize a lot, so that might not fit.

Option E says totalitarian regimes discourage a ruling elite, but I think the opposite happened in the USSR. They had a clear ruling class, the party elites.

Option G and A: The Soviet Union was a totalitarian regime that used its industrial capabilities to maintain control. So perhaps Kerr et al. were saying that advanced industrial tech helps such regimes stay in power. But wait, I thought their convergence theory suggested that industrial societies would trend towards more similar structures, possibly more open or managerial.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again. Kerr et al. might have argued that industrialization leads to a certain structure where a technocratic elite runs things, which could support a totalitarian regime because such a regime can control the technology and use it to maintain power.

So looking at the options, option G says "totalitarian regimes are more likely to maintain power with the help of advanced industrial technology." That aligns with the idea that the regime uses technology to sustain its control.

Alternatively, option A says advanced tech strengthens the power of totalitarian regimes. Both seem similar, but I think G is more about the likelihood of maintaining power because of the technology.

Wait, the question is about what the case of the Soviet Union supports. The Soviet Union had a strong totalitarian regime that industrialized heavily. So the argument would be that their advanced technology helped the regime maintain power. So that would support the idea that advanced industrial technology helps such regimes, which would be option A or G.

Wait, reading the options again:

Option A: advanced industrial tech strengthens power of totalitarian regimes.

Option G: totalitarian regimes are more likely to maintain power with help of advanced tech.

Hmm. Both seem possible. But Kerr et al. probably made a general claim about industrialization leading to certain structures. In their view, industrial societies might require cooperation between different groups, leading to more pluralistic systems. But in the case of the USSR, the regime didn't become more pluralistic; instead, it maintained its totalitarian structure but used the technology to keep power. So maybe the claim is that advanced tech helps these regimes maintain power, which would be option G.

Alternatively, maybe Kerr et al. were saying that advanced industrial technology is incompatible with totalitarian regimes because industrialization requires a more open society. But the Soviet Union used it to sustain their regime, so that would contradict Kerr's claim if they said that. But I'm not sure.

Wait, no, I think Kerr's argument was that industrialization leads to certain convergent trends, perhaps towards a more technocratic society, which might be more compatible with authoritarian regimes if they can manage the technology. So the presence of advanced technology would help the regime maintain its power.

So looking back, the correct answer is either A or G. Let me see the options again.

The options are A to J. The possible options I'm considering are A and G.

Option A: Advanced industrial tech strengthens the power of totalitarian regimes.

Option G: Totalitarian regimes are more likely to maintain power with the help of advanced industrial technology.

They seem very similar, but perhaps the wording is different. The question is about the claim supported by the Soviet case. The Soviet case shows that the regime used industrialization to strengthen its hold, so either A or G.

Alternatively, perhaps Kerr et al. argued that industrialization would lead to the rise of a technocratic elite, which might be a form of a ruling class. But the options don't directly mention that.

Wait, another angle: Maybe Kerr et al. thought that industrialization would lead to a more educated workforce, which would demand more political participation, thus leading to democratization. But the Soviet Union didn't do that; instead, they maintained a totalitarian regime despite industrialization. So that would contradict Kerr's claim, meaning the correct answer wouldn't be that.

Alternatively, perhaps Kerr et al. thought that industrialization requires a certain level of decentralization and pluralism, which totalitarian regimes can't provide. So the Soviet case would challenge that, showing that a totalitarian regime can industrialize.

Wait, but the question states that the case supports Kerr's claim. So if the Soviet Union successfully maintained a totalitarian regime with advanced tech, that would support the idea that such regimes can indeed maintain power through technology, which would be option G.

Alternatively, maybe Kerr's claim was that industrialization would make totalitarian regimes less likely, but the Soviet case shows the opposite, which would contradict, but the question says the case supports the claim.

Wait, I might have mixed up the details. Let me try to think about Kerr et al.'s actual argument. From what I remember, in their book "Industrialism and Industrial Man," they posited that as societies industrialize, they tend to develop similar characteristics, including in their political systems. They believed in a convergence theory where both capitalist and socialist societies become more alike, moving towards a managerial or technocratic society with a more educated workforce and decentralized decision-making.

But in the Soviet case, they maintained a highly centralized, totalitarian regime despite industrialization. So this might contradict Kerr's convergence theory because the USSR didn't adopt more decentralized structures. Therefore, the case would support a different claim.

Wait, but the question says the case supports Kerr's claim. So perhaps Kerr's claim was that advanced technology strengthens totalitarian regimes. But I don't think that's what they said. They probably thought industrialization would lead to more pluralism, so the Soviet case would contradict, but the question says it supports, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps Kerr et al. thought that industrialization would lead to the rise of a ruling technocratic elite, which is a form of totalitarianism. So the Soviet case supports that.

Looking at the options, option A is that advanced tech strengthens totalitarian regimes. Option G says they're more likely to maintain power with the tech.

So the correct answer would be A or G.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. The question is about what the Soviet case supports regarding Kerr et al.'s claim.

If Kerr et al. argued that industrialization leads to a more pluralistic society, then the Soviet example, which remained totalitarian, would contradict that. But the question says it supports the claim, so that can't be.

Alternatively, if Kerr et al. argued that industrialization strengthens the state's power, then the Soviet case would support that.

So, perhaps option A: advanced industrial tech strengthens the power of totalitarian regimes.

Yes, that makes sense. The Soviet Union used its industrial might to maintain its totalitarian regime, which supports the idea that advanced tech helps such regimes.

So the correct answer is A.

But wait, another angle: Kerr et al. might have said that industrialization leads to the necessity of a ruling elite, which would be option H: democratic governments serve the interests of a ruling elite. No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, option E: totalitarian regimes discourage a ruling elite. No, the Soviet Union had a clear ruling elite.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to find the answer.

The correct answer is likely option G. Because Kerr et al. thought that industrialization requires a certain type of organization that could be managed by a strong state, thus allowing totalitarian regimes to maintain power through advanced technology.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think the answer is A or G. I'll have to make a decision here.
</think>

The question asks which option is supported by the case of the former Soviet Union in relation to Kerr et al.'s (1960) claim. Kerr et al. argued that industrialization leads to convergent trends in political and social structures, potentially favoring technocratic or more centralized systems. The Soviet Union, as a totalitarian regime, industrialized heavily and used advanced technology to maintain its power, which aligns with the idea that industrialization can strengthen authoritarian regimes.

Option A states that "advanced industrial technology strengthens the power of totalitarian regimes," which fits the Soviet example, as the regime leveraged industrialization to sustain its control. Option G, "totalitarian regimes are more likely to maintain power with the help of advanced industrial technology," is similar but emphasizes the likelihood of maintaining power through technology. Both options are plausible, but Option A more directly captures the idea that industrialization strengthens totalitarian regimes, as seen in the Soviet case.

Thus, the correct answer is:

A
