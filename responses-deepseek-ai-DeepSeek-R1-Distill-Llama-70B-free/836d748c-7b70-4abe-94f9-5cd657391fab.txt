Okay, so I've got this question about the decay time of a radium atom. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking how many bits are needed to describe the decay time to three-digit accuracy, given that the half-life is 80 years. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, half-life is the median, right? So that means that 50% of the atoms decay before 80 years, and 50% take longer. So the decay isn't deterministic—it's a probability distribution. Oh right, it follows an exponential distribution because radioactive decay is a Poisson process, I think.

So the decay time can be modeled with an exponential distribution where the probability density function is f(t) = (1/τ) * e^(-t/τ), where τ is the mean lifetime. But wait, wait—half-life is T½ = τ * ln(2), so τ is T½ / ln(2). Since T½ is 80 years, τ = 80 / ln(2). Let me calculate that. Ln(2) is about 0.693, so τ ≈ 80 / 0.693 ≈ 115.5 years. So the mean is around 115.5 years.

But wait, the question is about the decay time to three-digit accuracy. That probably means we're considering the time with a precision of a year, maybe rounded to the nearest year. So three digits would be hundreds, tens, and units place. For example, 100 years, 150 years, etc.

But how does this relate to the number of bits needed? Bits are about information entropy. The number of bits required corresponds to the amount of uncertainty or information in the distribution.

Wait, but the question is about the average number of bits needed to describe the decay time to three-digit accuracy. So maybe it's related to the number of possible values the decay time can take, given that we're measuring it in three-digit years.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the entropy of the distribution. Let me think. The entropy H of an exponential distribution is given by H = 1 + ln(τ) (in nats, I think). But wait, the units—since we're talking about bits, maybe I need to convert nats to bits.

Wait, the entropy for an exponential distribution is actually H = 1 + ln(τ) when using natural logarithm. To convert to bits, I multiply by 1/ln(2), because 1 bit = ln(2) nats. So H_bits = (1 + ln(τ)) / ln(2).

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, the question might be simpler. If the decay time is measured to three digits, that means the possible values are from 0 to some maximum value, but since we're dealing with a distribution, perhaps we need to consider the possible range within three standard deviations or something like that.

Wait, another approach. The number of possible values the decay time can take, to three digits, would determine the number of possible outcomes. For example, if the time can be any integer year, then the number of possibilities is up to the maximum time we consider. But since the distribution is exponential, the probability gets very low as time increases, so maybe we can approximate the number of possible significant values.

Wait, the average information entropy would be the expected number of bits per outcome. So the entropy H is the expected value of the information, which for a continuous distribution is the integral of p(t) log2(1/p(t)) dt over all t.

But the exponential distribution's entropy is known. Let me think again. The entropy H with base 2 for an exponential distribution is H = log2(τ) + log2(e) + 1/(ln 2), wait no—maybe I should look up the formula, but I can't right now. Alternatively, I remember that the entropy of an exponential distribution with mean τ is H = 1 + ln(τ) / ln(2). Because for entropy in bits, it's H = (1 + ln(τ)) / ln(2) ?

Wait, let me get this straight. The differential entropy for the exponential distribution is H = 1 + ln(τ) when using natural logarithm. To convert to bits (base 2), we divide by ln(2), so H_bits = (1 + ln(τ)) / ln(2).

But wait, that doesn't seem right because the units should work out. Let me think. The entropy is in nats when using ln, and bits when using log base 2. So yes, to convert from nats to bits, you divide by ln(2).

So, τ is about 115.5 years. So ln(115.5) is approximately ln(100)=4.605, ln(115) is around 4.745. Let me calculate ln(115.5). Well, 115 is e^4.745 approx. So ln(115.5) ≈ 4.75.

So H_nats = 1 + 4.75 = 5.75 nats.

Convert to bits: H_bits = 5.75 / ln(2). Ln(2) is about 0.693, so 5.75 / 0.693 ≈ 8.3 bits.

Wait, but the options are all around 20-50 or 10-30. Hmm, that's confusing. So maybe this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of bits needed to represent the time to three significant figures, considering the possible range of times that have significant probability.

Wait, the half-life is 80 years, so the median is 80. The mean is about 115.5. The most probable time (mode) is zero, but that's not relevant here.

If we're measuring to three-digit accuracy, that would imply times like 100, 101, etc., up to maybe a few thousand years, but the probability drops off quickly.

Wait, but the question says "to three digit accuracy". So if the time is measured as, say, 100 years (three digits), 101, 102, etc., each representing a possible outcome. The number of possible outcomes would determine the number of bits needed, as bits = log2(N), where N is the number of possibilities.

So how many possible three-digit numbers do we need to consider? Well, the time starts at zero, but for three digits, the minimum is 100 years. But realistically, the decay time can be less than 100, like two digits, but when we describe it to three digits, perhaps we include leading zeros, like 001, 002, etc., but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe we're considering the time as a three-digit integer, so from 000 to 999, but that's 1000 possibilities. But that would require 10 bits (since 2^10=1024), but the options don't have 10 as the correct answer unless option C is 10, which is an option.

Wait, but the half-life is 80 years, so most decays happen around 80 years, but when considering three-digit accuracy, maybe the time can be up to, say, 1000 years, but the probability beyond a certain point is negligible.

Wait, but if we're considering the number of possible values the time can take, each with a certain probability, the entropy would be the average information per outcome. So the number of bits is the entropy H.

Earlier, I calculated that H_bits is around 8.3 bits. But the options don't have 8.3. The closest is option I:19, but that's higher than 8. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of bits needed to represent the time with three significant figures, regardless of the distribution. So for three significant figures, numbers could be from 100 to, say, 1000 years. But that's a range of 900 numbers, so log2(900) is about 9.8, so around 10 bits. But that's option C:10.

But the question isn't just about the number of possible values, but the average amount of information needed. So the entropy comes into play. But earlier calculation gave me around 8.3 bits, which is close to 8, but no option is 8. So maybe I'm not approaching this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of bits needed to specify the decay time to three significant digits, not considering the probability distribution. That would be more about the range of possible values. So if the time is measured as a three-digit number, the possible values range from, say, 0 to, well, theoretically infinity, but practically, beyond a certain point, the probability is negligible.

But for three-digit accuracy, the possible values would be from 0 to, say, 10^k, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about how many bits each measurement would take on average, considering the distribution.

Wait, another approach. The decay time t is exponentially distributed with mean τ=115.5. The question is about how many bits are needed to describe t to three-digit accuracy. So perhaps we're approximating t as an integer number of years, and we need to represent it with three digits. So each t can be represented as a 3-digit number, which would take 10 bits (since 2^10=1024 possibilities). But 3 digits can represent 1000 possibilities (000 to 999), which would require 10 bits. So the answer would be 10 bits, which is option C.

But wait, the options have C as 10, but earlier when I calculated the entropy, I got around 8.3 bits. But the question is about the average number of bits needed to describe to three-digit accuracy. If each measurement is represented as a 3-digit number, then each measurement requires 10 bits. So the average is 10 bits per measurement.

But that doesn't account for the distribution's entropy. Because if some numbers are more probable than others, you could in theory use fewer bits on average by using a more efficient encoding, like Huffman coding. But perhaps the question is more simplistic, assuming each possible 3-digit number is equally likely, requiring 10 bits per measurement.

But wait, the half-life is 80 years, so most measurements would cluster around that value, not spread uniformly up to 999. So perhaps the actual number of bits required, considering the distribution, would be lower than 10.

Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the information entropy of the distribution and how many bits that would take on average.

Wait, going back, I had H_bits ≈ 8.3 bits. Looking at the options, the closest higher option is E:28, which is way higher, or I:19, which is also higher. Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the entropy correctly. The differential entropy H for an exponential distribution with rate parameter λ is H = 1 + ln(1/λ) in nats. Since τ is the mean, λ = 1/τ.

Wait, no. Wait, the exponential distribution is usually written as f(t) = λ e^{-λ t} for t ≥ 0, where λ is the rate parameter. So the mean τ is 1/λ. So the entropy in nats is H = 1 + ln(1/λ) = 1 + ln(τ) (since λ=1/τ, so ln(1/λ) = ln(τ)).

So H_nats = 1 + ln(τ). Then, converting to bits, H_bits = (1 + ln(τ)) / ln(2).

Now, τ is 115.5 years. So ln(115.5) is about 4.75. So H_nats = 1 + 4.75 = 5.75 nats. Convert to bits: 5.75 / 0.693 ≈ 8.3 bits.

So approximately 8.3 bits. But none of the options are close to that. The options are A:50, B:35, C:10, D:40, E:28, F:16, G:24, H:45, I:19, J:30.

Hmm, 8.3 is closest to 10, which is option C. But perhaps the question is considering a different approach. Maybe it's not about the entropy but the number of bits needed to represent the time as a three-digit number. So each time is a three-digit integer, which can range from 0 to, say, 999, which would require 10 bits. So the answer would be 10, option C.

Alternatively, maybe it's considering the uncertainty in the measurement. Wait, three-digit accuracy implies that the time is known up to the nearest year, so the precision is one year. So the number of possible values is from, say, 1 to N, where N is when the probability becomes negligible. But the exponential distribution's tail extends infinitely, but beyond a certain point, the probability is so low that we can ignore it for practical purposes.

But without knowing the maximum time considered, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the number of significant figures and the information that conveys. Three significant figures could be represented with, say, 10 bits, as that's the number needed to represent 1000 possibilities.

Wait, but the options don't have 8 or 9, so perhaps the intended answer is 10 bits. So option C:10.

But I'm not entirely sure because the initial approach using entropy gave me around 8.3 bits, but the question might be looking for a different method. Maybe the correct answer is 10 bits, option C.
</think>

To determine how many bits are required on average to describe the decay time of a radium atom to three-digit accuracy, we start by noting that the half-life of radium is 80 years. This means the decay time follows an exponential distribution with a mean lifetime \( \tau = \frac{T_{1/2}}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{80}{0.693} \approx 115.5 \, \text{years} \).

The question asks for the number of bits required to describe the decay time to three-digit accuracy. This implies that the decay time is represented as a three-digit integer, which can range from 000 to 999, corresponding to 1000 possible values. The number of bits required to represent \( N \) possible values is given by \( \log_2(N) \). For \( N = 1000 \), \( \log_2(1000) \approx 9.966 \), which rounds to 10 bits.

While the entropy of the exponential distribution could also be calculated, the question appears to focus on the practical representation of the decay time as a three-digit number. Therefore, the number of bits required is determined by the range of possible values, which is 1000 for three-digit accuracy. This corresponds to approximately 10 bits.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C: 10**
