Question:

A state has recently enacted a statute making it a misdemeanor for any person to smoke a cigarette, cigar, or pipe in any restaurant, bar, cafe, or other establishment within the state. A defendant was tried in state court for violating the anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's evidence consisted of testimony regarding the defendant's cigarette smoking at a restaurant. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, they called a witness who testified to a prior conviction of the defendant that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing. The judge immediately granted a mistrial and excused the jury. The state prosecutor appealed the ruling under a statute that permitted prosecutorial appeals in such circumstances. The state won the appeal, but the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute the defendant. However, the city attorney from the city in which the restaurant was located then sought to prosecute the defendant for the same incident under the city's anti-smoking ordinance, which was identical to the state statute. The city attorney planned to call as her only witness a man who testified at the defendant's first trial. The defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that the prosecution of the city charge would violate his rights against double jeopardy. The court should

Options:

A: deny the motion, because the judge granted a mistrial.
B: grant the motion, because it is the same incident being prosecuted.
C: grant the motion, because the city attorney is using the same witness.
D: deny the motion, because the first trial resulted in a mistrial.
E: grant the motion, because the law and the evidence will be identical at the second trial.
F: deny the motion, because the city's anti-smoking ordinance is separate from the state statute.
G: grant the motion, because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.
H: deny the motion, because the city has its own jurisdiction.
I: grant the motion, because the defendant was not re-prosecuted by the state.
J: deny the motion, because the city and the state are separate sovereigns.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about double jeopardy, and I need to figure it out. Let's start by breaking down the scenario.

So, there's a state that made a law against smoking in restaurants, bars, etc. A defendant was tried in state court for violating this law. The prosecution presented evidence, including a witness who testified about the defendant's prior conviction, which the judge had excluded earlier. The judge called a mistrial and dismissed the jury.

Then, the state prosecutor appealed, and they won the appeal. But the prosecutor decided not to retry the case. Now, the city attorney from the city where the restaurant is located wants to prosecute the same incident under the city's own anti-smoking ordinance, which is identical to the state statute. The city's case would use the same witness from the first trial.

The defendant is moving to dismiss, arguing double jeopardy. The question is whether the court should grant or deny that motion.

Alright, so the key issue here is double jeopardy. I remember that the Double Jeopardy Clause in the Fifth Amendment protects against being tried twice for the same offense after jeopardy has attached. But I also recall that there's the dual sovereignty doctrine, which allows separate prosecutions by different sovereigns for the same conduct.

Wait, so the state and the city are two different entities. Are they considered separate sovereigns? I think that cities are considered part of the state government, not separate sovereigns. So if the state prosecutes someone, a city within that state can't prosecute for the same offense because they're not separate sovereigns. But wait, some sources say that in some cases, municipalities might be able to bring their own charges if they have the authority, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, I think that the dual sovereignty doctrine applies when two different sovereigns, like state and federal, prosecute for the same action. Because each sovereign has its own authority to enforce its own laws. But a city ordinance is under the state's authority, so the city isn't a separate sovereign. So the city's prosecution would be under the same sovereign as the state's. Therefore, if the state already tried the defendant, the city can't try him again for the same offense because it's the same sovereign.

But wait, in this case, the state prosecutor initially tried the defendant, then the state appealed and won, but the prosecutor decided not to retry. So the first trial ended in a mistrial. Does that affect the double jeopardy analysis?

I think when a mistrial is granted, whether double jeopardy applies depends on the reason for the mistrial. If the mistrial was declared without the defendant's consent and without the prosecutor's misconduct, then retrial might be allowed. But in this case, the mistrial was because the prosecution presented evidence that was supposed to be excluded. So maybe the state could retry, but they chose not to.

Wait, but the state decided not to re-prosecute, so the case is dismissed. Now the city wants to prosecute the same conduct under their ordinance. So the question is whether the city can do that when the state can't.

But since the city is part of the same sovereign as the state, they can't prosecute if the state already did and it's the same offense. So the defendant's double jeopardy rights would be violated if the city proceeds.

Alternatively, maybe the city's ordinance is a separate offense. But the question says the ordinance is identical to the state statute. So it's the same conduct being prosecuted again. Since it's the same sovereign, the city can't do that.

Wait, but what if the city ordinance is considered a separate law? But in terms of double jeopardy, it's about the same offense, regardless of the specific law. So if the conduct is the same, and it's the same sovereign, then it's barred.

So looking at the options, the correct answer would be that double jeopardy applies because it's the same sovereign prosecuting for the same offense.

Wait, but let me think again. The state had a mistrial, then the state decided not to retry. Now the city, which is a separate entity, is prosecuting. If the city is a separate sovereign, then they can. But I think cities aren't separate sovereigns from the stateâ€”they're just subdivisions. So the city's prosecution would be under the same sovereign as the state, meaning double jeopardy applies.

So the court should grant the motion to dismiss because it's the same sovereign prosecuting the same offense, violating double jeopardy.

Looking at the options, option B says grant because same incident, but that's not precise. Option E says same law and evidence, which is more about same offense. Option G says jeopardy attached in first prosecution. So in the first trial, jeopardy attached when the jury was sworn in. Then, because the first trial ended in a mistrial without the defendant's consent and without his fault, would retrial be allowed? Wait, but the state decided not to retry, so the case was dismissed. Now, the city is trying to prosecute again.

But wait, the Double Jeopardy Clause would bar a second prosecution by the same sovereign. So since the state and city are the same sovereign, the city can't proceed. So the correct answer would be that the court should grant the motion because the same sovereign is prosecuting the same offense.

Looking at the options, option J says deny because city and state are separate sovereigns. But that's incorrect because they're not. So the correct answer should be that the city can't prosecute because it's the same sovereign, so double jeopardy applies.

Looking through the options, option E says grant because the law and evidence are identical. That's a bit about same offense. Option G says grant because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution. That's also correct.

Wait, if in the first trial, the jury was sworn, so jeopardy attached. Then the mistrial was declared. If the mistrial was without the defendant's consent and not due to manifest necessity, then retrial would violate double jeopardy. But in this case, the state decided not to retry, so the case ended. But then the city is trying to bring the same charge. Since the city is part of the same sovereign, they can't.

So the defendant's motion should be granted because he's being tried again by the same sovereign for the same offense. So looking at the options, option G says grant because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution. That seems correct because once jeopardy attaches, being tried again by the same sovereign is barred.

Alternatively, option E is about the law and evidence being identical, which also points to same offense.

But the key here is that the city and state are the same sovereign. So the answer would be that the court should grant the motion because it's the same sovereign prosecuting the same offense.

Wait, but wait. Actually, the state and the city are not separate sovereigns. So if the state could not prosecute again, neither can the city. So the defendant's motion should be granted.

Looking at the options, option J says deny because they're separate sovereigns, which is incorrect. So option G or E.

Option G says grant because jeopardy attached. That's correct because once jeopardy attaches, the same sovereign can't try again. But in this case, the first trial ended in a mistrial, so can the state retry? Well, the state decided not to, but the city is trying to. So the city is part of the same sovereign as the state. So the second prosecution by the city would be the same sovereign, so it's barred.

So the correct answer would be that the court should grant the motion, because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution, making option G correct.

Alternatively, option E says same law and evidence, which would mean same offense, so that's also correct.

Wait, but the primary reason is double jeopardy because same sovereign. So the correct answer is G: grant because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.

Alternatively, another way: since the state and city are the same sovereign, the city can't prosecute if the state already did, regardless of the outcome of the state's case. So the court should grant the motion, option G.

The question revolves around whether the city can prosecute the defendant for the same incident under its anti-smoking ordinance after the state prosecution ended in a mistrial and the state decided not to retry. The key issue is double jeopardy, which protects against being tried twice for the same offense by the same sovereign after jeopardy has attached.

In this case, the state and the city are not separate sovereigns. Cities are subdivisions of the state government, and their prosecutions are considered part of the same sovereign authority. Therefore, if the state cannot retry the defendant due to double jeopardy, the city also cannot prosecute the same offense under its ordinance, even if the ordinance is identical to the state statute.

During the first trial, jeopardy attached when the jury was sworn in. Although the trial ended in a mistrial due to the prosecution's error, the state decided not to retry the defendant. Since the city is part of the same sovereign as the state, prosecuting the defendant again would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. The cityâ€™s attempt to prosecute the same offense constitutes an impermissible second prosecution by the same sovereign.

Among the options provided, the correct reasoning is that jeopardy attached in the first prosecution, barring further prosecution by the same sovereign. Therefore, the court should grant the motion to dismiss.
