Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Quantity Equation of Exchange. Hmm, I remember that the equation is related to economics, specifically monetarism. I think it's something that connects money supply with other economic factors.

Wait, the question is asking for the correct formula. From what I recall, the equation is often written as MV = PQ. Let me break that down. M stands for money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the quantity of goods and services, which relates to real GDP.

So putting it together, the equation should be PQ equals MV. Let me look at the options. Option B is PQ = MV, which matches what I remember. Option J is PQ ≡ MV, but I'm not sure about the triple equal sign here. Oh wait, sometimes in economics, the triple bar (≡) is used to denote an identity, meaning it's always true by definition. But the standard form I've seen uses the equals sign, so I think option B is more commonly presented that way.

Wait, but sometimes the equation is written with M and V on one side and PQ on the other. So yeah, option B is definitely PQ equals MV. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing them up. Option A is M = PQ/V, which is rearranged but not the standard form. Option E is V equals PQ/M, which is the same as rearranged from the correct equation, but not the equation itself. So no, the correct one is option B.

The Quantity Equation of Exchange is a fundamental concept in economics that relates the money supply (M) to the price level (P), the quantity of goods and services (Q), and the velocity of money (V). The standard form of the equation is:

\[
MV = PQ
\]

This equation states that the money supply multiplied by the velocity of money equals the price level multiplied by the quantity of goods and services. Among the given options, the correct representation of this equation is:

**B: PQ = MV**

Other options either present rearranged forms or incorrect symbols, making them less accurate representations of the Quantity Equation of Exchange.

Answer: B
