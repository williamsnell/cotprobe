Question:

When alkali metals dissolve in liquid ammonia, their atoms each lose an electron and give rise to a deep-blue solution that contains unpaired electrons occupying cavities in the solvent. These 'metal-ammonia solutions' have a maximum absorption at $1500 \mathrm{~nm}$. Supposing that the absorption is due to the excitation of an electron in a spherical square well from its ground state to the next-higher state (see the preceding problem for information), what is the radius of the cavity?

Options:

A: 0.45 nm
B: 0.89 $\mathrm{~nm}$
C: 0.75 $\mathrm{~nm}$
D:  0.69 $\mathrm{~nm}$
E: 0.99 nm
F: 1.25 nm
G: 0.62 nm
H: 0.30 nm
I: 0.54 $\mathrm{~nm}$
J: 1.10 nm

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about alkali metals dissolving in liquid ammonia, creating a deep-blue solution. The question relates to the absorption of light by these solutions, which is at a maximum of 1500 nm. The setup is that the absorption is due to an electron being excited in a spherical square well, moving from the ground state to the next higher state. I need to find the radius of the cavity based on this information.

Hmm, I remember from my quantum mechanics classes that a particle in a spherical square well has quantized energy levels. The energy levels depend on the quantum numbers and the radius of the well. The energy levels for a particle in a 3D infinite square well are given by the formula:

E_n = (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) * (h²/(8mπ²a²)) 

Wait, but wait, for a spherical square well, I think the quantization is a bit different. Oh right, in a spherical well, the energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number n and the angular momentum quantum number l. But wait, no, in the case of a square well (as opposed to the hydrogen atom), the energy levels might be treated differently.

Wait, I think in a spherical square well (like a 3D box), the energy levels are given by something like E = (n² h²) / (8 m a²), where n is the principal quantum number, h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the electron, and a is the radius of the sphere. But wait, no, I think I might be mixing this up with the 1D case. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the energy levels for a particle in a 3D spherical box (spherical square well) are given by E = (n² π² ħ²) / (2 m a²), where n is the principal quantum number (like 1, 2, 3...), a is the radius of the sphere, m is the mass, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Or wait, maybe it's E = (n² h²) / (8 m a²), similar to a 3D cubic box but adjusted for sphere. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula here.

Wait, let's get this straight. For a 3D infinite potential well (like a cubic box), the energy levels are E = (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) * (h²/(8mL²)), where L is the side length. But for a spherical well, the quantization is in spherical coordinates, so the energy depends on the principal quantum number n and the angular momentum quantum number l. But in that case, the energy levels are degenerate for different l values with the same n. But wait, this problem is considering only the transition from the ground state to the next higher state, so perhaps the spherical well is treated as a 3D box where the ground state is n=1 and the next is n=2, ignoring angular momentum? Or maybe it's a 1D model? No, I think it's 3D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the electron as being in a 1D box, but that seems less likely. The question mentions "spherical square well", so I need to find the correct formula for the energy levels in such a setup.

Wait, perhaps the energy for a particle in a spherical square well is given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2 m a²), where n is an integer (like 1,2,3...), a is the radius of the sphere, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the ground state would be n=1, and the next higher state would be n=2.

But wait, let's think about the transition. If the electron is excited from the ground state (n=1) to the next state (n=2), the energy difference ΔE would be E_2 - E_1.

So E_1 = (π² ħ²) / (2 m a²)
E_2 = (4 π² ħ²) / (2 m a²) → because (2)^2 =4.

So ΔE = E_2 - E_1 = (4 π² ħ²)/(2 m a²) - (π² ħ²)/(2 m a²) ) = (3 π² ħ²) / (2 m a² )

Wait, that makes sense. So the energy difference is proportional to 3. Then, the photon absorbed would have energy equal to this ΔE.

The wavelength of maximum absorption is given as 1500 nm, which is 1500 x 10^-9 meters. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

So, setting ΔE equal to hc/λ:

(3 π² ħ²) / (2 m a² ) = h c / λ

Now, I can solve for a, the radius of the cavity.

Wait, let's plug in the constants and see.

But first, let's note that ħ = h/(2π), so ħ² = h²/(4 π²). Let's substitute that into our equation.

So, substituting:

(3 π² (h²/(4 π²)) ) / (2 m a² ) ) = h c / λ

Simplify the numerator in the left-hand side:

3 π² * h²/(4 π²) = 3 h² / 4

So the left-hand side becomes (3 h² /4 ) / (2 m a² ) ) = (3 h²) / (8 m a² )

So:

3 h² / (8 m a² ) = h c / λ

We can cancel h from both sides:

3 h / (8 m a² ) = c / λ

Then, solving for a²:

a² = (3 h λ ) / (8 m c )

So,

a = sqrt( (3 h λ ) / (8 m c ) )

Now, let's plug in the numbers.

h = Planck's constant = 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s
m = mass of electron = 9.109 x 10^-31 kg
c = speed of light = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s
λ = 1500 nm = 1500 x 10^-9 m

Compute the numerator inside the square root:

3 * h * λ = 3 * 6.626e-34 J·s * 1500e-9 m
= 3 * 6.626e-34 * 1.5e-6
= Let's compute 6.626e-34 *1.5e-6 = approx 9.939e-40
Then, 3 * 9.939e-40 = 2.9817e-39

Denominator: 8 m c =8 *9.109e-31 kg *3e8 m/s
= 8 * 9.109e-31 *3e8
= 8 * 2.7327e-22
= 2.186e-21

So the fraction becomes:

(2.9817e-39) / (2.186e-21 ) = approx 1.365e-18

Then, a = sqrt(1.365e-18) meters.

Compute sqrt(1.365e-18):

sqrt(1.365) is approx 1.169, and sqrt(1e-18) is 1e-9. So 1.169e-9 meters, which is 1.169 nanometers.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 1.169. Let me check the calculation again because maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recompute the values more accurately, perhaps I approximated too much.

Compute numerator: 3 * h * λ.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value)
λ = 1500e-9 m.

3 * 6.62607015e-34 * 1500e-9 = ?

6.62607015e-34 * 1500e-9 = 6.62607015e-34 * 1.5e-6 = 9.939105225e-40
Multiply by 3: 2.9818156675e-39

Denominator: 8 * m * c

m = 9.1093837015e-31 kg
c= 3e8 m/s.

8 * 9.1093837015e-31 *3e8 = 8 * (9.1093837015e-31 *3e8)
Compute 9.1093837015e-31 *3e8 = 2.73281511e-22
Multiply by 8: 21.86252188e-22 = 2.186252188e-21

So the fraction is 2.9818156675e-39 / 2.186252188e-21 = Let me compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator:

2.9818156675e-39 / 2.186252188e-21 = (2.9818156675 / 2.186252188 )e-18

Compute 2.9818 / 2.18625 ≈ 1.364. So, 1.364e-18.

So a^2 = 1.364e-18 m² → a = sqrt(1.364e-18) m.

Compute sqrt(1.364e-18):

= sqrt(1.364) * 1e-9 m.

sqrt(1.364) is approx 1.168. So a ≈ 1.168e-9 m = 1.168 nm.

Looking at the options, I don't see 1.168. The options are:

A: 0.45 nm

B: 0.89 nm

C: 0.75 nm

D: 0.69 nm

E: 0.99 nm

F: 1.25 nm

G: 0.62 nm

H: 0.30 nm

I: 0.54 nm

J: 1.10 nm

Hmm, 1.168 is close to 1.1 nm. Option J is 1.10 nm. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy level equation. Let me double-check the setup.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels for a spherical square well aren't the same as a 3D box. Wait, I think I might have confused the model. Alternatively, maybe the energy levels are for a 1D infinite square well. Let me think.

Wait, the question says that absorption is due to the excitation of an electron in a spherical square well from its ground state to the next higher state. So the model is a spherical well, which in 3D.

Hmm, perhaps I should be using the formula for a 3D box.

Wait, in the 3D box, the energy levels are given by:

E = (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) * (h²/(8mL²)),

where L is the size in each dimension. But for a spherical well, perhaps it's modeled as a 3D box where the radius is related to the size. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition as from n=1 to n=2 in a 1D box, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the ground state as the lowest energy level (say, n=1), and the next higher state as n=2 in a 1D box, so the energy difference would be:

E_2 - E_1 = (4 - 1) * (h²/(8m a²)) ) = 3 h²/(8 m a² )

Which is the same expression I used earlier. So the formula I used is correct, assuming that it's a 1D box model. But the problem states it's a spherical square well, so maybe the energy expression is different.

Ah, maybe I should be using the formula for a particle in a 3D spherical well, which would have E proportional to n^2, where n is the principal quantum number. So the ground state is n=1, first excited is n=2, etc. So the energy difference would be E_2 - E_1 = (4 -1) * (something) = 3 * something.

Wait, but in a 3D spherical well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n^2 h^2)/(8 m a^2), where a is the radius of the sphere. So the same as the 1D case? That can't be right, because in 3D, the energy depends on the sum of squares of the quantum numbers.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying the model, treating the cavity as a 1D box, so the energy levels are E_n = n² h²/(8 m a²), with a being the length of the box (but for a sphere, perhaps a is the diameter or radius? Hmm, that's a confusion point.)

Wait, if the model treats the cavity as a 1D box, and the length of the box is L, then a is perhaps the radius of the sphere, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, for a 1D box, the length L would be the diameter of the sphere. Or perhaps it's better to model the spherical cavity as a 3D box with L = 2a, where a is the radius. Hmm, maybe.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from the definition of a in the formula. Let me think again.

In the 1D infinite square well, the energy levels are E_n = n² h²/(8 m L²), where L is the width of the well. If the well is a sphere of radius a, perhaps the model approximates it as a cube with edge length 2a, so L = 2a. Then, the energy levels would be E_n = n² h²/(8 m (2a)^2) ) = n² h²/(32 m a²)

Wait, that would change the calculation. Let me redo the problem with that assumption.

So, for a 3D cubic box with edge length L, E = (n_x² + n_y² +n_z²) h²/(8 m L²). But if the cavity is a sphere of radius a, perhaps the model uses a cube of edge length 2a, so L=2a. Then, the ground state would have n_x=n_y=n_z=1, so E_111 = (1+1+1) h²/(8 m (2a)^2) ) = 3 h²/(32 m a² )

The next higher state could be where one of the quantum numbers increases to 2, like n_x=2, others 1. So E_211 = (4 +1 +1) h²/(8 m (2a)^2) ) = 6 h²/(32 m a² ) = 3 h²/(16 m a² )

So the energy difference would be ΔE = E_211 - E_111 = (3 h²/(16 m a^2 )) - (3 h²/(32 m a^2 )) ) = (6 h²/(32 m a^2) - 3 h²/(32 m a^2 )) ) = 3 h²/(32 m a^2 )

Wait, but that's a much smaller energy difference than before. So the transition energy is lower. But in the problem, the maximum absorption is at 1500 nm, which is in the infrared, so lower energy.

Wait, but this approach might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I should stick with the initial approach, treating it as a 1D box, which gives a radius around 1.168 nm, which is close to option J (1.10 nm), but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the square root.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(1.364e-18) again.

Wait, 1.364e-18 m² → square root is sqrt(1.364) * 1e-9 m.

sqrt(1.364) is approximately 1.168, so a is approximately 1.168e-9 meters, or 1.168 nm.

Looking back at the options, J is 1.10 nm, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the model uses a different formula, such as E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2 m a² )

Wait, let's try that approach.

So E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2 m a² )

So E_1 = (π² ħ²)/(2 m a² )

E_2 = (4 π² ħ²)/(2 m a² ) = (2 π² ħ²)/(m a² )

ΔE = E_2 - E_1 = (2 π² ħ²)/(m a² ) - (π² ħ²)/(2 m a² ) )

= (4 π² ħ² - π² ħ² )/(2 m a² )

= (3 π² ħ² )/(2 m a² )

So, ΔE = 3 π² ħ² / (2 m a² )

Setting this equal to hc/λ:

3 π² ħ² / (2 m a² ) = h c / λ

Now, substituting ħ = h/(2π):

3 π² (h²/(4 π²)) / (2 m a² ) = h c / λ

Simplify numerator: 3 π² * h²/(4 π²) = 3 h² /4

So,

(3 h² /4 ) / (2 m a² ) = h c / λ

Which becomes 3 h² / (8 m a² ) = h c / λ

Same equation as before. So the same calculation applies, giving a ≈1.168 nm.

Hmm, same result. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the value of Planck's constant or another constant.

Wait, let me check the constants again.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exactly, since 2019 redefinition)
m_e = 9.1093837015e-31 kg (exact)
c = 299792458 m/s, but often approximated as 3e8 m/s for such problems.

Let me compute with more precise values.

Compute numerator: 3 * h * λ

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s
λ = 1500e-9 m

3 * h * λ = 3 * 6.626
