Okay, so I've got this question about depreciation using the declining-balance method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, Dr. Frankel bought an X-ray machine for $4,000. It's expected to last 5 years, and the salvage value at the end is $800. He wants to use a 40% depreciation rate. I need to compute the depreciation for each of the 5 years.

Wait, right, the declining-balance method... Also known as reducing balance depreciation. So each year, the depreciation is calculated on the book value of the asset, which decreases each year because of the depreciation. The formula for depreciation each year is (rate) × (book value). 

But wait, there's a catch. The salvage value is the amount the asset is expected to be worth at the end of its useful life. So the depreciation can't bring the book value below the salvage value. Oh right, in some methods, like the double-declining balance, you switch to straight-line in the last year to avoid going below salvage. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. 

Let me outline the steps. The initial cost is $4,000. Salvage is $800, so the total depreciable amount is $4,000 - $800 = $3,200. The depreciation rate is 40%, so 0.4. 

Wait, wait, in the declining balance method, you apply the rate each year to the current book value. So first year depreciation is 40% of $4,000, which is $1,600. Then the book value becomes $4,000 - $1,600 = $2,400.

Second year: 40% of $2,400 is $960. Book value drops to $2,400 - $960 = $1,440.

Third year: 40% of $1,440 is $576. Book value is now $1,440 - $576 = $864.

Fourth year: 40% of $864 is $345.6. So book value becomes $864 - $345.6 = $518.4.

Fifth year: 40% of $518.4 is $207.36. That would bring book value to $518.4 - $207.36 = $311.04. Wait, but that's still above the salvage value of $800? No, wait, the salvage is $800, which is higher than the book value after 5 years in this calculation. That can't be right. Wait, no, wait, I think I messed up the calculation.

Wait, no, wait. The machine is expected to have a salvage value of $800 after 5 years. So after 5 years, the book value should be $800. But in this calculation, after four years, the book value is $518.4, and the fifth year's depreciation would take it to $311.04, which is below the salvage value. So we can't let that happen.

Ah, right, so in the declining balance method, you have to adjust the last year's depreciation to ensure that the book value doesn't go below the salvage value. So each year, you calculate the depreciation as (rate × book value), but if that would make the book value drop below salvage, you just depreciate the difference between current book value and salvage.

So, let me recalculate:

Year 1: 40% of 4000 = 1600. BV becomes 2400.

Year 2: 40% of 2400 = 960. BV becomes 1440.

Year 3: 40% of 1440 = 576. BV becomes 864.

Year 4: 40% of 864 is 345.6. BV becomes 864 - 345.6 = 518.4.

Year 5: 40% of 518.4 is 207.36. But 518.4 - 207.36 = 311.04, which is below 800. So instead, the depreciation in year 5 is 518.4 - 800 = negative, which doesn't make sense. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, why is it lower than the salvage? Oh, wait, no. The salvage is 800, so the book value can't go below 800. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The total depreciable amount is 4000 - 800 = 3200. Using the declining balance method, but ensuring that the sum of depreciation equals 3200.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to handle it is to calculate depreciation each year as usual until the last year, when you adjust so that the total depreciation doesn't exceed the depreciable amount.

Wait, let's see. After 4 years, the total depreciation is 1600 + 960 + 576 + 345.6 = let's calculate that. 1600 + 960 is 2560. 2560 + 576 is 3136. 3136 + 345.6 is 3481.6. The total depreciable amount is 3200, so 3481.6 is more than that. So that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Hmm, wait, no. Because if I don't adjust, the total depreciation over 5 years would be 1600 + 960 + 576 + 345.6 + 207.36 = let's add that. 1600+960=2560. +576=3136. +345.6=3481.6. +207.36=3688.96. But the depreciable amount is 3200, so this is way over. That can't be correct.

So perhaps the problem is that I'm not considering that the salvage value affects the calculation. So in the declining balance method, the depreciation is applied each year, but the book value can't go below the salvage value. So when the next year's depreciation would drop the book value below the salvage, you instead take the exact amount needed to reach the salvage.

So let's recast the calculations.

Year 1: 4000 * 40% = 1600. BV is 4000 - 1600 = 2400.

Year 2: 2400 *40% = 960. BV 2400-960=1440.

Year 3:1440*40% =576. BV 1440-576=864.

Year4:864 *40% =345.6. BV 864-345.6=518.4.

At this point, the next year (year5) would have depreciation of 518.4 *40% = 207.36. But 518.4 -207.36 = 311.04, which is less than the salvage value of 800. Therefore, this can't be right. So in year5, instead of taking 207.36 depreciation, we take the amount that brings BV down to 800.

So the remaining BV is 518.4 at the start of year5. So depreciation needed is 518.4 - 800 = negative, which doesn't make sense. Wait that can't be. Wait, no: if the BV is 518.4, and the salvage is 800, then that can't be correct because the BV would have decreased below the salvage. So perhaps the problem is that the depreciation in the fifth year should not be 207.36, but instead, we have to stop depreciating once the BV reaches the salvage.

Wait, that doesn't make sense either because the salvage is higher than the current BV. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong, and the depreciation should be calculated in such a way that the total over the years adds up to 3200.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the rate is 40% of the initial value each time, but perhaps the salvage is considered so that the total depreciation doesn't exceed 3200.

Alternatively, perhaps the 40% is applied each year, but in the last year, the depreciation is just the remaining amount needed to reach the salvage.

Let me think again.

Total depreciable amount is 4000 -800=3200.

Year1: 1600 (40% of 4000). Cumulative:1600.

Year2:960 (40% of 2400). Cumulative:2560.

Year3:576 (40% of 1440). Cumulative:3136.

Year4: 345.6 (40% of 864). Cumulative:3481.6.

Wait, but 3481.6 is more than 3200. That can't be, because the total depreciation can't exceed 3200.

So perhaps the approach is that in the last year, when the depreciation would exceed the remaining depreciable amount, we adjust the depreciation.

So after year3, the cumulative is 3136. The remaining is 3200-3136=64.

So in year4, instead of 345.6, we can only take 64. So depreciation in year4 is 64. Then BV becomes 864 -64=800.

Then year5: since BV is 800, which is the salvage, no more depreciation.

So the depreciation for each year would be:

Year1:1600

Year2:960

Year3:576

Year4:64

Year5:0

Looking at the options, let me see. Option D is 1600,960,576,64,0.

Yes, that matches. But wait, let me check the other options. Option A is 1600,960,576,345.6,207.36, which would sum to 3688.96, which is more than 3200, so that's impossible. So option D would have total depreciation of 1600+960+576+64=3200. So that's correct.

Wait, but why does option A exist? Because it's just 40% each year without considering the salvage. So that's probably why. But in reality, the depreciation can't make the BV go below the salvage, so the last year's depreciation is adjusted.

So the correct answer should be option D.

To compute the depreciation for each year using the declining-balance method, we start with the initial cost of the X-ray machine ($4,000) and apply a depreciation rate of 40%. The salvage value at the end of 5 years is $800, and the total depreciable amount is $4,000 - $800 = $3,200. The depreciation is calculated as follows:

1. **Year 1**:  
   Depreciation = 40% of $4,000 = $1,600.  
   Book Value (BV) = $4,000 - $1,600 = $2,400.  

2. **Year 2**:  
   Depreciation = 40% of $2,400 = $960.  
   Book Value (BV) = $2,400 - $960 = $1,440.  

3. **Year 3**:  
   Depreciation = 40% of $1,440 = $576.  
   Book Value (BV) = $1,440 - $576 = $864.  

4. **Year 4**:  
   Depreciation = 40% of $864 = $345.6.  
   Book Value (BV) = $864 - $345.6 = $518.4.  

At this point, the remaining depreciable amount is $3,200 - ($1,600 + $960 + $576 + $345.6) = $64. In **Year 5**, the depreciation is adjusted to ensure the book value does not drop below the salvage value of $800. Therefore, the depreciation in Year 5 is $518.4 - $800 = $0.

The depreciation for each year is as follows:  
- Year 1: $1,600  
- Year 2: $960  
- Year 3: $576  
- Year 4: $64  
- Year 5: $0  

This matches **Option D**.
