Question:

A man wearing a jacket and jeans walked along a city street at night in a high crime area known for drug trafficking and gun violence. He saw two police officers walking toward him. The officers were checking on a 911 call from a resident who observed a man in jeans and a jacket apparently selling drugs to people on the street. When the police first saw him, he was walking alone, in the area that the woman identified. As they approached, he suddenly crossed the street by jaywalking. They followed, and approaching from behind, asked him to stop. He started walking faster, away from them. The officers saw what appeared to be a heavy object bulging in his pocket as he moved. The officers, with over 10 years of foot patrol experience, stepped up and stopped him. They patted him down and found a concealed, unlicensed handgun in the jacket pocket. They then made a full search and found 50 packets of heroin. He filed a motion to suppress the gun and drug evidence. Will the court likely suppress the evidence?

Options:

A: No, because the accumulation of factors all added up to reasonable suspicion for a stop and articulable suspicion for a frisk.
B: No, because the man's suspicious behavior and the bulge in his pocket gave the police probable cause to search him.
C: Yes, because the police lacked reasonable suspicion to stop the man simply because he crossed the street and walked faster away from them.
D: Yes, because the police didn't have a warrant to search the man.
E: Yes, because the heavy object in the man's pocket could have been anything and didn't necessarily indicate criminal activity.
F: No, because the police had probable cause to make an arrest when the man began to walk away from them and walk even faster as they followed him.
G: No, because the police had witnessed a crime, jaywalking, which gave them the authority to stop the man.
H: Yes, because they didn't know if this was the same man, they observed nothing illegal except jaywalking, and he had a right to avoid them under the circumstances.
I: Yes, because the police had no evidence that the man was the same one the resident had reported.
J: No, because the man matched the description of the suspected drug dealer and was in a high crime area.

Alright, I need to figure out whether the court will suppress the evidence based on the scenario provided. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the man is walking in a high crime area known for drug trafficking and gun violence. A 911 call came in about a man in jeans and a jacket selling drugs. The officers are responding to that call.

When the police saw him, he was alone in the area identified by the caller. Then, when approaching, he jaywalked across the street. The officers followed and asked him to stop. He started walking faster away from them. The officers noticed a heavy object in his pocket, which made them stop him, pat him down, and find a gun and heroin.

The question is whether the court will suppress this evidence. So, the issue here is about the legality of the stop and the subsequent search.

I remember that in the US, the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. For a stop, the police need reasonable suspicion, which is less than probable cause. Reasonable suspicion requires articulable facts that the person is involved in criminal activity.

In this case, the man matched the description given by the resident—wearing jeans and a jacket. He was in the area where the drug activity was reported. So, that gives some suspicion. But then he jaywalked. Is jaywalking enough to stop someone? Well, jaywalking is a minor offense, but does it add to reasonable suspicion? Maybe, but I think the key factors are the description and the location.

When the officers approached, he started walking faster. Avoiding the police can be a factor, but it's not sufficient on its own. However, when he started walking faster, the officers saw a bulge in his pocket. They had over 10 years of experience, so their assessment that it was a heavy object might be given some weight.

The key here is whether the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop him. The factors are: high crime area, matching the description, evasive behavior (jaywalking and walking away), and a bulge in the pocket that could be a weapon.

I think the bulge, combined with the other factors, might give them reasonable suspicion. So, the stop might be justified. Then, when they patted him down and found a gun, that would allow them to search further.

Wait, but some might argue that the initial stop was unlawful. Let me think about relevant cases. In Terry v. Ohio, the Supreme Court said that officers can conduct a stop and frisk if they have reasonable suspicion. The frisk is allowed if they reasonably believe the person is armed and dangerous.

In this case, the heavy object could be a weapon, so the frisk would be justified. Finding the gun would then allow further search.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no because the accumulation of factors added up to reasonable suspicion for a stop and articulable suspicion for a frisk. That sounds correct because the combination of factors (description, high crime area, evasive actions, bulge) gives reasonable suspicion.

Option B says no because of probable cause. But the standard for a stop is reasonable suspicion, not probable cause. So B is incorrect.

Option C says yes because the police lacked reasonable suspicion. But considering all factors, perhaps they did have reasonable suspicion, so C is incorrect.

Option D is about a warrant, which isn't relevant here because warrantless searches can be okay under Terry.

Option E says the bulge could be anything. But the officers' experience might lead them to believe it's a weapon, so E is incorrect.

Option F talks about probable cause. No, the stop is based on reasonable suspicion, not probable cause, so F is wrong.

Option G says they stopped him for jaywalking. While jaywalking is a crime, it's minor, but the main reason was the description and other factors. So G might not be the best reason.

Option H says yes because they didn't know if he was the same man and he had a right to avoid. But the description matched, and the area was correct, so H is incorrect.

Option I says they had no evidence he was the same man. But the description matched, so I is incorrect.

Option J says no because he matched the description and was in a high crime area. That's part of it, but the key is the combination of all factors for reasonable suspicion.

So the best answer seems to be A.

The court is unlikely to suppress the evidence because the accumulation of factors—matching the description from the 911 call, being in a high crime area, evasive behavior (jaywalking and walking faster), and the presence of a heavy object in his pocket—provided the officers with reasonable suspicion to stop him. Under Terry v. Ohio, this suspicion justified the stop and frisk. The frisk, conducted by experienced officers, revealed a concealed handgun, which then allowed for a full search. These actions align with constitutional standards for stops and searches based on reasonable suspicion and articulable fear of danger.
