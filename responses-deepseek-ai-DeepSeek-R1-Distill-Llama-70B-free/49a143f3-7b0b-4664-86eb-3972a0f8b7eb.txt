Okay, so I have this physics problem here about radioactive nuclei formation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let's try to think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the number of radioactive nuclei formed per second when an aluminum foil is bombarded with thermal neutrons. The given parameters include the foil's area, thickness, the neutron flux, the cross-section of aluminum, and its density. The options are from A to J, so I need to compute the correct value.

First, I remember that the basic formula for the reaction rate is N = Φ * σ * n, where Φ is the neutron flux, σ is the cross-section, and n is the number of target nuclei. So I need to find n, the number of aluminum nuclei in the foil.

Wait, wait, the foil is a certain area and thickness. So the volume would be area multiplied by thickness. But I need to be careful with the units here. The area is given in cm² and the thickness in mm, so I should convert them to meters if I'm using SI units, but maybe it's easier to convert to cm for everything.

Let me jot down the given values:

- Area (A) = 1.5 cm²
- Thickness (t) = 1.2 mm = 0.12 cm (since 1 cm is 10 mm)
- Neutron flux (Φ) = 1e7 sec^-1 cm^-2
- Cross-section (σ) = 0.232 barn. Oh wait, barn is 1e-24 cm². So σ = 0.232e-24 cm².
- Density (ρ) = 2.7e3 kg/m³. Hmm, but I might need this in g/cm³ for easier calculations because 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. Oh wait, 2.7e3 kg/m³ is 2.7 g/cm³. Because 1 kg/m³ is 0.001 g/cm³, so 2.7e3 kg/m³ is 2.7 * 1e3 * 0.001 g/cm³ = 2.7 g/cm³.

So the volume of the foil (V) is area * thickness. Let's compute that.

V = A * t = 1.5 cm² * 0.12 cm = 0.18 cm³.

Now, density is mass per volume, so mass (m) = density * volume. So m = 2.7 g/cm³ * 0.18 cm³ = 0.486 grams.

Wait, but I need the number of nuclei, so I need to find moles first. The molar mass of aluminum is about 27 g/mol. So moles (n_m) = mass / molar_mass = 0.486 g / 27 g/mol ≈ 0.018 mol.

Then, the number of nuclei is moles multiplied by Avogadro's number, which is 6.022e23 nuclei/mol.

n = n_m * Avogadro = 0.018 mol * 6.022e23 nuclei/mol ≈ 1.08396e22 nuclei.

Wait, but wait, that's the total number of nuclei in the foil. But wait, the formula for reaction rate is Φ * σ * n, where n is the number of target nuclei per unit area? Or is it per unit volume? Hmm, I might be mixing things up.

Alternatively, I think the formula is the product of the neutron flux (Φ, neutrons per cm² per second), the cross-section (σ, cm² per nucleus), and the number of nuclei (n), so the reaction rate R is:

R = Φ * σ * n

But wait, Φ is per cm², so to account for the area, maybe I should compute it differently. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The neutron flux Φ is the number of neutrons passing through per cm² per second. So the total number of neutrons hitting the foil per second is Φ multiplied by the area of the foil.

But wait, no. The flux is per cm², so the total number of neutrons hitting would be Φ (per cm²) multiplied by the area (cm²), so that gives neutrons per second.

But each neutron has a probability of interacting with each nucleus, given by the cross-section. So the total interactions (i.e., nuclei formed per second) would be the number of neutrons hitting the foil multiplied by the number of target nuclei they pass through, each multiplied by the cross-section.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to model it as R = Φ * σ * N, where N is the number of target nuclei in the beam path. Wait, but sometimes it's calculated per unit volume, so I might need to compute the number of nuclei per cm².

Alternatively, maybe the formula is R = Φ * σ * n * V, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down.

First, compute the volume of the foil: 1.5 cm² * 0.12 cm = 0.18 cm³.

The mass of the foil is 2.7 g/cm³ * 0.18 cm³ = 0.486 grams.

Molar mass of Al is 27 g/mol, so moles = 0.486 / 27 ≈ 0.018 mol.

Number of atoms (nuclei) = 0.018 * 6.022e23 ≈ 1.084e22 nuclei.

So the number of target nuclei is 1.084e22.

The neutron flux Φ is 1e7 neutrons/(cm²·s).

But wait, the flux is per cm². So the total number of neutrons hitting the foil would be Φ * area. But each of those neutrons has a chance to interact with each nucleus in the foil's volume. So perhaps the reaction rate is Φ (per cm²) multiplied by area (cm²) to get total neutrons per second, and then multiplied by the number of nuclei and the cross-section.

Wait, no, I think the standard formula is R = Φ * N * σ, where N is the number of target nuclei. Because for each nucleus, the probability of interaction per neutron is σ (cm²) times the neutron flux (neutrons per cm² per second) gives events per second.

Wait, more accurately, the reaction rate is:

R = Φ * σ * N

Where:

- Φ is the neutron flux (neutrons per cm² per second)
- σ is the cross-section (cm² per nucleus)
- N is the number of target nuclei.

So putting it all together:

R = Φ * σ * N

Plugging in the numbers:

Φ = 1e7 neutrons/(cm²·s)
σ = 0.232e-24 cm²
N = 1.084e22 nuclei

So R = (1e7) * (0.232e-24) * (1.084e22)

Let me compute this.

First, multiply 1e7 and 0.232e-24:

1e7 = 1e7
0.232e-24 = 2.32e-25
Multiply: 1e7 * 2.32e-25 = 2.32e-18

Now multiply by 1.084e22:

2.32e-18 * 1.084e22 = 2.32 * 1.084 * 1e4 (because 1e-18 * 1e22 = 1e4)

2.32 * 1.084 is approximately 2.32 * 1 = 2.32, 2.32 * 0.084 ≈ 0.195. So total ≈ 2.515.

So 2.515e4, which is about 2.515 x 10^4.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.5e4, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to avoid any mistakes.

Compute R step-by-step:

Φ = 1e7 / (cm² s)
σ = 0.232e-24 cm²
N = 1.084e22

So R = 1e7 * 0.232e-24 * 1.084e22

Let me compute the exponents first:

1e7 * 1e-24 * 1e22 = 1e(7-24+22) = 1e5.

Then the coefficients:

1 * 0.232 * 1.084 = ?

Compute 0.232 * 1.084:

0.232 * 1 = 0.232
0.232 * 0.08 = 0.01856
0.232 * 0.004 = 0.000928
Adding them together: 0.232 + 0.01856 = 0.25056 + 0.000928 = 0.251488.

So 0.251488 * 1e5 = 2.51488e4, which is approximately 2.5e4. So option B is the correct answer.

To determine the number of radioactive nuclei formed per second for the given aluminum foil, we use the formula for the reaction rate:

\[
R = \Phi \cdot \sigma \cdot N
\]

Where:
- \( \Phi \) is the neutron flux (\( 10^7 \, \text{neutrons/cm}^2/\text{s} \)),
- \( \sigma \) is the cross-section of aluminum (\( 0.232 \, \text{barn} = 0.232 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^2 \)),
- \( N \) is the number of aluminum nuclei in the foil.

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of the foil
The area of the foil is \( 1.5 \, \text{cm}^2 \), and the thickness is \( 1.2 \, \text{mm} = 0.12 \, \text{cm} \). The volume is:

\[
V = \text{Area} \cdot \text{Thickness} = 1.5 \, \text{cm}^2 \cdot 0.12 \, \text{cm} = 0.18 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the mass of the foil
The density of aluminum is \( 2.7 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \). The mass is:

\[
m = \text{Density} \cdot \text{Volume} = 2.7 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \cdot 0.18 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.486 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of moles of aluminum
The molar mass of aluminum is \( 27 \, \text{g/mol} \). The number of moles is:

\[
n_{\text{moles}} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{0.486 \, \text{g}}{27 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.018 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of aluminum nuclei
Using Avogadro's number (\( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{nuclei/mol} \)), the total number of nuclei is:

\[
N = n_{\text{moles}} \cdot 6.022 \times 10^{23} = 0.018 \, \text{mol} \cdot 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{nuclei/mol} \approx 1.084 \times 10^{22} \, \text{nuclei}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the reaction rate
Substitute the values into the reaction rate formula:

\[
R = \Phi \cdot \sigma \cdot N
\]

\[
R = (10^7 \, \text{neutrons/cm}^2/\text{s}) \cdot (0.232 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^2) \cdot (1.084 \times 10^{22} \, \text{nuclei})
\]

First, calculate the product of the coefficients:

\[
10^7 \cdot 0.232 \cdot 1.084 \approx 2.51488
\]

Next, calculate the powers of 10:

\[
10^7 \cdot 10^{-24} \cdot 10^{22} = 10^{5}
\]

Combine the results:

\[
R \approx 2.51488 \times 10^5 \, \text{nuclei/s}
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 2.51488 \times 10^5 \, \text{nuclei/s} \) is **B: \( 2.5 \times 10^5 \, \text{nuclei/s} \)**.

ANSWER: B
