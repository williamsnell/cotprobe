Okay, so I've got this question about catalase and its turnover number. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question says that catalase has a turnover number of 2 × 10^8. I remember that the turnover number is the number of substrate molecules that one enzyme molecule can convert per unit time. So in this case, per unit time, each catalase enzyme can break down 2e8 H2O2 molecules.

The question is asking, how much hydrogen peroxide can one catalase molecule decompose in one hour? The options are given, so I need to calculate this and match it.

Wait, first, I should get the units right. Oh, right, turnover number is usually per second, but sometimes per minute. Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify the time unit for the turnover number. Hmm, that's a problem. Because if the turnover number is per second versus per hour, the result would be way different.

Wait, the question says the turnover number is 2e8. Oh, wait, probably the turnover number is per second. Because that's a typical value for catalase. Let me think: I recall that catalase has a very high turnover number, and 2e8 per second sounds right. So probably, the given turnover number is per second.

So if that's the case, in one hour (3600 seconds), the total number of molecules processed would be turnover number multiplied by time.

So, number of molecules per hour = 2e8 molecules/sec * 3600 sec = 7.2e11 molecules.

Wait, no, wait. Because that's the number of molecules per hour.

But the question is about the weight. So I need to find the mass of that many H2O2 molecules.

The molar mass of H2O2 is (2×1) + (2×16) = 2 +32 =34 g/mol.

Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 molecules/mol.

So, total moles per hour would be 7.2e11 molecules / 6.022e23 molecules/mol ≈ 1.194e-12 mol.

Multiply by molar mass to get grams: 1.194e-12 mol *34 g/mol ≈ 4.06e-11 grams.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see. Option C is 8.5e-11, which is about twice what I have. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait. Let me go through the steps again.

1. Turnover number = 2e8 per second. So in one hour (60*60=3600 seconds), per molecule:

2e8 * 3600 = 7.2e11 molecules.

2. Moles = number of molecules / Avogadro's number.

7.2e11 /6.022e23 = approximately 1.194e-12 moles.

3. Molar mass of H2O2 is 34.00 g/mol.

So mass = 1.194e-12 *34 = approx 4.06e-11 grams.

Looking at the options, option C is 8.5e-11, which is about double that.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me check.

Wait, 2e8 per second times 3600 is 2e8 *3.6e3 = 7.2e11, right.

7.2e11 molecules is 7.2e11 /6.022e23 = 1.194e-12 mol.

1.194e-12 mol times 34 g/mol is 4.06e-11 grams.

But the closest option is C:8.5e-11, which is about twice as much. Hmm. Did I perhaps make a mistake in the turnover number's time unit?

Wait, perhaps the turnover number is per hour? That would change everything. Let me reevaluate.

If the turnover number is 2e8 per hour, then in one hour, it's 2e8 molecules. Then:

2e8 molecules is 2e8 /6.022e23 = approx 3.32e-16 mol.

Multiply by 34 g/mol: 3.32e-16 *34 = approx 1.1288e-14 grams. Which is about 1.1e-14 grams. Looking at the options, D is 1.99e-14, which is close, but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, but the question says "the turnover number of 2 × 10^8". I think the turnover number is typically given per second. Because 2e8 per hour would be a much smaller number. Wait, no, turnover numbers are often per second. So that first approach where I calculated 4e-11 grams is correct, but the closest option is option C (8.5e-11). Hmm, perhaps I did a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should recompute the exact numbers.

Calculating moles:

Number of molecules = 2e8 *3600 = 720,000,000,000,000 molecules.

Wait, 2e8 is 200,000,000 per second. 200,000,000 *3600 = 720,000,000,000,000 molecules.

720e12 =7.2e14? Wait no, 2e8 is 200 million, times 3600 is 720,000 million. So 720,000 million is 7.2e11 (since 1 million is 1e6, 720,000 million is 720,000 ×1e6 =7.2e11).

So 7.2e11 molecules.

Molar amount is 7.2e11 /6.022e23 = (7.2/6.022) * 1e-12.

7.2 /6.022 is approximately 1.194, so 1.194e-12 moles.

Multiply by molar mass 34: 1.194e-12 *34 = approx 4.06e-11 grams.

So 4.06e-11 grams. Looking at the options, the options are:

Option A:9.07 ×1e-14

Option C:8.5e-11

Option F:6.766e-13

Option G:4.2e-13

Hmm, none of the options exactly match 4.06e-11. So perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, perhaps the molar mass is wrong.

Wait, H2O2 is H2O2. So molecular weight is 2*(1) + 2*(16) = 2 +32=34 g/mol. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the Avogadro's number is taken as 6.02e23, which would make the calculation a bit different.

Let me compute 7.2e11 /6.022e23 = 7.2e11 /6.022e23 = (7.2/6.022) *1e-12.

7.2 divided by 6.022 is approximately 1.194.

So 1.194e-12 mol.

Multiply by 34: 1.194 *34 = approx 40.6 (but because it's 1e-12 *34, so 4.06e-11 grams).

So 4.06e-11 grams. Wait, none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 8.5e-11. If I got 4.06e-11, maybe I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me check the turnover number.

Wait, turnover number is 2e8 per second, correct? So 2e8 per second *3600 sec =7.2e11 molecules per hour.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by the number of molecules processed per catalytic cycle. Or perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another approach: the turnover number is the number of substrate molecules converted per enzyme molecule per unit time. So per second, 2e8 molecules. So per hour, 2e8 *3600 = 7.2e11 molecules.

Molar amount is 7.2e11 /6.022e23 = 1.194e-12 mol.

Mass is 1.194e-12 *34 = 4.06e-11 grams.

So the correct answer should be around 4.06e-11 grams. But looking at the options, the closest is option C (8.5e-11) and option I (7.5e-9). Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for something else. Oh wait, wait a second. The catalytic decomposition of H2O2 by catalase produces O2 and H2O. But wait, the question is about the decomposition of H2O2, so each molecule of H2O2 is broken down into other products, so the number should be correct as per the turnover.

But perhaps I should double-check the numbers.

Wait, 2e8 per second is 200,000,000 molecules per second per enzyme. So in 3600 seconds, it's 200,000,000 *3600 = 720,000,000,000 molecules, which is 7.2e11 molecules.

Yes. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass. Wait, another thought: Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 molecules per mole. So 7.2e11 molecules is 7.2e11 /6.022e23 = approx 1.194e-12 moles.

Multiply by 34 g/mol: 1.194e-12 *34 = approx 4.06e-11 g.

Looking at the options, option C is 8.5e-11, which is twice as much. Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in the initial turnover number. Wait, what if the turnover number is per minute instead of per second?

Because if the turnover number is per minute, then per hour it would be 2e8 *60 =1.2e10 molecules per hour.

Wait, let's try that. So if turnover number is 2e8 per minute, then per hour it's 2e8 *60 =1.2e10 molecules.

Molar amount: 1.2e10 /6.022e23 = approx 1.99e-14 moles.

Multiply by 34: 1.99e-14 *34 = approx 6.77e-13 grams. Oh, that's close to option F:6.766e-13 grams.

But wait, the question says the turnover number is 2e8, and it's usually per second. So I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question states that the turnover number is per hour. But that's unlikely because typical turnover numbers are per second or per minute.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the number of moles.

Wait, 7.2e11 molecules / Avogadro's number (6.022e23) = 7.2e11 /6.022e23 = approx 1.194e-12 mol.

1.194e-12 *34 = 4.06e-11 grams.

Looking at the options, I don't see that exact number. So perhaps I missed a step. Oh wait, perhaps the question is asking about the weight of oxygen produced, but no, the question says the weight of hydrogen peroxide decomposed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the calculation is done per mole of enzyme. But no, the question says per molecule of catalase.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value for Avogadro's number to get a more precise result.

So let me calculate 7.2e11 /6.02214076e23 = ?

7.2e11 =7.2 *1e11 =7,200,000,000,000.

Divide by 6.02214076e23:

7,200,000,000,000 / 602,214,076,000,000,000,000 = approx 1.194e-12 mol.

Hmm, same as before.

So 1.194e-12 *34 = 40.6e-12 =4.06e-11 grams.

So the correct answer should be around 4e-11 grams.

Looking again at the options, the closest is option C: 8.5e-11. But that's more than twice my result. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the time factor.

Wait, wait—what's the exact definition of turnover number? Oh, sometimes turnover number is given as per minute. Let me check that possibility.

If the turnover number is 2e8 per minute, then in one hour (60 minutes), it would be 2e8 *60 =1.2e10 molecules.

Molar amount:1.2e10 /6.022e23 =1.991e-14 mol.

Mass:1.991e-14 *34=6.766e-13 grams.

Which matches option F:6.766e-13.

But why would the turnover number be per minute? I thought it's usually per second. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from the unit of turnover number. Let me recall: catalase has an extremely high turnover number. For example, I think catalase's turnover number is around 4e7 per second, but perhaps in some sources it's given as 2e8 per second.

Wait, for example, if the turnover number is 2e8 per second, then per hour it's 7.2e11 molecules, which gives 4.06e-11 grams. But none of the options match that. Unless I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the molar mass again. Wait, H2O2 has a molecular weight of 34 g/mol. Right.

Wait, another approach: 2e8 per second is 2e8 molecules/sec.

Multiply by 3600 sec: 7.2e11 molecules.

Number of moles: 7.2e11 /6.022e23 = 1.194e-12 mol.

Mass: 1.194e-12 *34 =4.06e-11 grams.

So the correct answer should be approximately 4.06e-11 grams, but looking at the options, there's no such option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption of the turnover number's time unit.

Alternatively, maybe the question gives the turnover number as per hour. Then:

If turnover number is 2e8 per hour, then in one hour, 2e8 molecules.

Molar amount:2e8 /6.022e23 =3.32e-16 mol.

Mass:3.32e-16 *34 =1.13e-14 grams. That's close to option D:1.99e-14.

Hmm, but that's a factor of ~1.76 difference.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate more precisely.

So 2e8 molecules is 2e8 /6.022e23 = (2/6.022) *1e-15 = approx 0.332 *1e-15 =3.32e-16 mol.

3.32e-16 *34 =1.1288e-14 grams.

So 1.1288e-14 grams. The option D is 1.99e-14. So doesn't match exactly.

But wait, perhaps the exact Avogadro's constant is taken as 6.022e23.

Let me compute 2e8 /6.022e23 = 2e8 /6.022e23 = approx 3.32e-16 mol.

Multiply by 34:3.32e-16 *34=1.1288e-14 grams.

So 1.13e-14 grams.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.99e-14 which is about double. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of molecules. Let me think again: if the turnover number is per hour, then in one hour, 2e8 molecules. So that would be 2e8 molecules per hour.

Wait, but I'm getting 1.13e-14 grams, which is close to option D (1.99e-14) but not exactly. Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation brings it closer.

Alternatively, maybe the turnover number is per minute, and thus in one hour, it's 2e8 *60 =1.2e10 molecules.

Which gives 1.2e10 /6.022e23 = approx 1.99e-14 mol.

1.99e-14 *34=6.77e-13 grams, which matches option F:6.766e-13.

But why would the turnover number be per minute? Because if the question says 2e8, I thought it's per second, but perhaps it's per minute.

Wait, let me think about real-world values. Catalase's turnover number is actually around 4e7 per second, so 4e7 *3600 =1.44e11 per hour. So 2e8 per second would be 7.2e11 per hour. So that's possible.

But then the calculated mass is 4.06e-11 grams, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C:8.5e-11, which is about double. Maybe I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps each catalase enzyme has four active sites, but the turnover number is given per active site. So perhaps each enzyme can process 4 times as much. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the molar mass is considered as 18 instead of 34. No, that's for water. H2O2 is 34.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the decomposition into O2 and H2O, so perhaps the molar mass is different. But no, the question asks for the weight of H2O2 decomposed, so it's based on H2O2's molar mass.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A:9.07 ×1e-14

B:2e8

C:8.5e-11

D:1.99e-14

E:5e-12

F:6.766e-13

G:4.2e-13

H:1.2e10

I:7.5e-9

J:3.8e-15

My calculation for when turnover is per second gives 4.06e-11 grams, which isn't an option. But option C is 8.5e-11, which is about double. So perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere. Wait, perhaps each H2O2 molecule
