Okay, so I need to figure out the pH of lemon juice. Hmm, I remember that pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is. The scale goes from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Values below 7 are acidic, and above are basic.

Wait, lemon juice is pretty sour. I think that means it's acidic. So the pH should be lower than 7. But I'm not exactly sure of the exact number. I remember that strong acids like hydrochloric acid have a pH of 1, but lemon juice isn't that strong. Maybe around 2 or something?

Let me think about common foods. Vinegar is also acidic, right? I think vinegar has a pH around 2.4. Lemons are more acidic than vinegar, I believe. So if vinegar is about 2.4, lemon juice must be a bit lower, maybe around 2.0 or 1.8?

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. I've heard that lemon juice is around pH 2. Maybe option D is 2. Let me look at the options: Option D is 2, and option H is 5. Oh wait, 5 would be less acidic than I thought. Because 5 is still acidic, but higher than 2. 

So, between options D and H. I think lemon is more acidic than soda, which I think is around pH 3.5. So lemon should be lower than that. So 2 makes sense. So the answer should be D: 2.

But wait, is there any chance it's higher? I've also heard that the stomach pH is around 1.5 to 3.5 because of the digestive acids. But lemon juice isn't as acidic as stomach acid. So maybe lemon is around 2, which would make sense.

Another thought: I remember that tomato juice has a pH around 4.2, which is more acidic than milk but less than lemons. So lemon would be lower, around 2. So yeah, the answer is D.

The pH scale measures acidity and basicity, with values below 7 indicating acidity. Lemon juice is known to be acidic, and while strong acids like hydrochloric acid have a pH of 1, lemon juice is less acidic. Vinegar, for comparison, has a pH of about 2.4, and lemon juice is slightly more acidic, typically around 2.0 or 1.8. This places it lower than options like 5 but higher than stomach acid, which is around 1.5â€“3.5. Given the options, the closest approximation for lemon juice is pH 2.

Answer: D
