Question:

A tank is in the shape of a triangular prism. If the triangular base has an area of 116 square feet, and the tank is 30 feet tall, how much water would the tank contain when it is full?

Options:

A: 2320 ft^3
B: 8700 ft^3
C: 2900 ft^3
D: 1725 ft^3
E: 5000 ft^3
F: 3480 ft^3
G: 1740 ft^3
H: 6960 ft^3
I: 4640 ft^3
J: 4000 ft^3

Okay, so I have this problem about a tank that's shaped like a triangular prism. The question is asking how much water it would contain when full. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the volume of a prism is calculated by finding the area of the base and then multiplying it by the height (or length, depending on how you look at it) of the prism. So the formula should be Volume = Base Area × Height.

The problem gives me the area of the triangular base, which is 116 square feet. That's the base area part. And the tank is 30 feet tall, which I think is the height of the prism. So I need to multiply these two numbers together to get the volume.

Wait, let me make sure. Oh right, in a prism, the height refers to the length of the prism, not the height of the triangular base. So if the tank is 30 feet tall, that's the length of the prism part.

So putting it into the formula: Volume = 116 sq ft * 30 ft. Let me calculate that. 116 multiplied by 30. Let me see, 100*30 is 3000, and 16*30 is 480, so adding those gives 3480. So the volume should be 3480 cubic feet.

Now looking at the options, option F is 3480 ft³, so that must be the correct answer. Wait, let me double-check the options. A is 2320, B is 8700, C is 2900... Yeah, F is 3480. That matches my calculation.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The base area is given, the height is given, multiply them. Seems straightforward. I don't see any other factors like units or anything else that might complicate it. So I'm confident the answer is F.

The volume of a triangular prism is calculated by multiplying the area of the triangular base by the height (or length) of the prism. Given the base area is 116 square feet and the height of the tank is 30 feet, the volume is:

\[
\text{Volume} = 116 \, \text{ft}^2 \times 30 \, \text{ft} = 3480 \, \text{ft}^3
\]

From the provided options, the correct answer is **F: 3480 ft³**.

Answer: F
