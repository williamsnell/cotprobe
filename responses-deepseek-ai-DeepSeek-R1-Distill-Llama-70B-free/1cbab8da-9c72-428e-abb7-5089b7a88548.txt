Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about group theory, specifically permutations. The question is asking, what's the largest order of an element in the group of permutations of 5 objects? The options are A through J, with numbers like 20, 25, 10, etc.

Hmm, I remember that the symmetric group S_n consists of all permutations of n elements. So for 5 objects, we're talking about S_5. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer m such that raising the element to the mth power gives the identity element.

Now, in permutation groups, the order of a permutation is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of its disjoint cycles. So to find the largest possible order, I need to consider permutations in S_5 and determine which cycle structure gives the highest LCM.

Let me think about the possible cycle structures. For 5 elements, the possible partitions are:

1. 5 (a single 5-cycle)
2. 4+1 (a 4-cycle and a fixed point)
3. 3+2 (a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle)
4. 3+1+1 (a 3-cycle and two fixed points)
5. 2+2+1 (two 2-cycles and a fixed point)
6. 2+1+1+1 (a 2-cycle and three fixed points)
7. 1+1+1+1+1 (all fixed, which is the identity)

So for each of these, I need to compute the LCM of the cycle lengths and see which is the largest.

Starting with each case:

1. 5-cycle: The length is 5. So order is 5.
2. 4+1: LCM of 4 and 1 is 4.
3. 3+2: LCM of 3 and 2 is 6.
4. 3+1+1: LCM is 3.
5. 2+2+1: LCM of 2 and 2 is 2.
6. 2+1+1+1: LCM is 2.
7. All fixed: Order is 1.

Looking at these, the maximum order is 6, which comes from the 3+2 cycle structure.

Wait, but wait a second. Is there any other cycle structure I'm missing? Oh right, what about a 5-cycle? Oh, I included that, which gives order 5. So 6 is higher than that.

So the largest order is 6. Now looking back at the options, option D is 6. So the answer should be D.

The question asks for the largest order of an element in the symmetric group \( S_5 \), which consists of all permutations of 5 objects. The order of an element in a permutation group is determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of its disjoint cycles. To find the largest possible order, we analyze the cycle structures of elements in \( S_5 \):

1. **5-cycle**: A single cycle of length 5. The order is \( \text{LCM}(5) = 5 \).
2. **4+1**: A 4-cycle and a fixed point. The order is \( \text{LCM}(4, 1) = 4 \).
3. **3+2**: A 3-cycle and a 2-cycle. The order is \( \text{LCM}(3, 2) = 6 \).
4. **3+1+1**: A 3-cycle and two fixed points. The order is \( \text{LCM}(3, 1, 1) = 3 \).
5. **2+2+1**: Two 2-cycles and a fixed point. The order is \( \text{LCM}(2, 2, 1) = 2 \).
6. **2+1+1+1**: A 2-cycle and three fixed points. The order is \( \text{LCM}(2, 1, 1, 1) = 2 \).
7. **1+1+1+1+1**: All fixed points (identity element). The order is \( \text{LCM}(1, 1, 1, 1, 1) = 1 \).

Among these, the largest order is 6, which corresponds to the cycle structure **3+2**. Therefore, the largest order of an element in \( S_5 \) is 6.

The correct answer is **D: 6**.
