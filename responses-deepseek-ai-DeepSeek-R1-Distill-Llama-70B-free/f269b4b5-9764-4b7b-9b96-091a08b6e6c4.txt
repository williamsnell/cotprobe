Question:

Which of the following statements would "supply-side" economists disagree with?

Options:

A: Tax changes cause shifts in aggregate supply that work against shifts in aggregate demand thus reducing the effect of the tax change on real GDP.
B: A tax increase is likely to decrease aggregate supply by decreasing after-tax wages and thus providing disincentives to work.
C: A tax cut is likely to increase aggregate supply by boosting saving investment and thus capital accumulation.
D: A tax cut is likely to increase aggregate supply by providing greater rewards for risk taking.
E: A tax cut is likely to decrease aggregate supply by creating a budget deficit.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about supply-side economics. Hmm, I need to figure out which statement a supply-side economist would disagree with. Let me think about what I remember about supply-side economics.

Supply-side economics focuses on the production side of the economy. They believe that lower taxes and reduced regulation can lead to increased production, which then drives economic growth. Their main idea is that if you cut taxes, especially on income and investments, people will work more, save more, and invest more because they get to keep more of their earnings. This should increase the aggregate supply, right?

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Tax changes cause shifts in aggregate supply that counter shifts in aggregate demand, thus reducing the effect on real GDP. Wait, so if taxes change, aggregate supply shifts, but it works against aggregate demand. So if demand is down, and supply shifts up, it might balance out. I'm not sure if supply-siders would agree with this. Or maybe they focus more on how tax changes directly impact supply, not so much on the demand side. Not sure yet.

Option B: A tax increase decreases aggregate supply by lowering after-tax wages, which discourages work. That makes sense. If people take home less, they might work less, so supply goes down. Supply-siders would agree that higher taxes are bad for supply. So they wouldn't disagree with this.

Option C: A tax cut increases aggregate supply by boosting savings and investment, leading to more capital. Yeah, that's classic supply-side. Lower taxes mean more savings and investment, so capital accumulation increases. They definitely agree with this.

Option D: A tax cut increases aggregate supply by rewarding risk-taking. Supply-siders believe that lower taxes incentivize entrepreneurship and investment because the rewards are higher. So they would agree with this statement.

Option E: A tax cut decreases aggregate supply by creating a budget deficit. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Supply-siders argue that tax cuts can lead to higher economic growth, which might offset the deficit through increased tax revenues. They probably don't think tax cuts decrease supply. Instead, they think tax cuts increase supply. So a statement saying a tax cut decreases supply would be something they disagree with.

Wait, but does a budget deficit affect supply? I think most supply-siders are more concerned with the incentives from tax rates rather than the deficit. They might even argue that the deficit isn't as bad if it leads to growth. So option E says the tax cut decreases supply via budget deficit, which sounds more like a Keynesian concern or traditional view. Supply-siders wouldn't agree with that because their main point is that tax cuts boost supply, not reduce it.

So the question is asking which statement supply-side economists would disagree with. So the incorrect statement from their perspective is the one that says tax cuts decrease aggregate supply. That's option E.

Wait, double-checking. Option E says a tax cut is likely to decrease aggregate supply by creating a budget deficit. Supply-siders believe that tax cuts increase incentives, leading to more production and thus higher aggregate supply. They wouldn't agree that tax cuts decrease supply due to deficits. So they would disagree with statement E.

Supply-side economists focus on the production side of the economy and argue that lower taxes and reduced regulation can lead to increased production and economic growth. They believe that tax cuts incentivize work, savings, investment, and risk-taking, thereby increasing aggregate supply. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: This suggests that tax changes affect aggregate supply in a way that counters aggregate demand shifts. Supply-siders focus on how tax changes directly impact supply, not necessarily how they interact with demand. This is less central to their core beliefs.
- **Option B**: A tax increase decreasing aggregate supply by reducing after-tax wages aligns with supply-side views, as they emphasize the disincentivizing effects of higher taxes.
- **Option C**: Tax cuts boosting savings, investment, and capital accumulation is a classic supply-side argument.
- **Option D**: Tax cuts increasing aggregate supply by rewarding risk-taking is also consistent with supply-side economics.
- **Option E**: This claims that tax cuts decrease aggregate supply by creating a budget deficit. Supply-siders argue that tax cuts increase supply through incentives and growth, not that they reduce supply due to deficits. This directly contradicts their beliefs.

The statement that supply-side economists would disagree with is **Option E**, as it incorrectly suggests that tax cuts decrease aggregate supply due to budget deficits, which is not aligned with their focus on incentives and growth.
