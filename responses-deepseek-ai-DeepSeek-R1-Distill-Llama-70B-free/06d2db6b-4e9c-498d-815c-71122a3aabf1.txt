Okay, so I've got this problem about computing the stresses in a saw as it goes over a driving pulley. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I remember that when a belt or a saw goes around a pulley, it's subjected to some kind of stress, probably related to bending because it's wrapping around the pulley. 

The problem gives me the material as alloy steel with a modulus of elasticity E = 30 × 10^6 psi. The thickness is 1/32 of an inch. Oh wait, I should convert that to inches properly. 1/32 is 0.03125 inches. The pulley has a diameter of 15 inches, so radius is half of that, which is 7.5 inches.

Wait, I think the stress in the saw when it bends around the pulley is called the bending stress. The formula for bending stress in a curved beam is σ = E * t / (2r), where t is the thickness and r is the radius of the pulley. Or wait, maybe the formula is σ = E * t / (2r) because as the saw wraps around the pulley, it's like a curved beam with radius r. 

So plugging in the numbers: E is 30e6 psi, t is 0.03125 inches, and r is 7.5 inches.

Let me compute that. 30e6 multiplied by 0.03125. Let's see, 30e6 is 30,000,000. 30,000,000 times 0.03125. 0.03125 is 1/32, right? So 30,000,000 divided by 32 is 937,500. Oh wait, wait, 30e6 * 0.03125 = 30e6 * (1/32) = 30e6 /32 = 937,500 psi. Then that's E*t.

Now divide by (2r). So 2r is 15 inches. So 937,500 psi divided by 15. Let's compute that. 937,500 ÷15. Hmm, 15 × 60,000 is 900,000. So 937,500 -900,000 is 37,500. 37,500 ÷15 is 2,500. So total is 60,000 + 2,500 = 62,500 psi. So the stress is 62,500 psi.

Looking at the options, option E is 62,500 psi. So the answer should be E.

To compute the stresses in the saw as it goes over the driving pulley, we use the formula for bending stress in a curved beam:

\[
\sigma = \frac{E \cdot t}{2r}
\]

Where:
- \( E = 30 \times 10^6 \, \text{psi} \) (modulus of elasticity of alloy steel),
- \( t = \frac{1}{32} \, \text{in} = 0.03125 \, \text{in} \) (thickness of the saw),
- \( r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \, \text{in} \) (radius of the pulley).

Substituting the values:

\[
\sigma = \frac{30 \times 10^6 \cdot 0.03125}{2 \cdot 7.5}
\]

First, calculate \( E \cdot t \):

\[
30 \times 10^6 \cdot 0.03125 = 937,500 \, \text{psi}
\]

Next, calculate \( 2r \):

\[
2 \cdot 7.5 = 15 \, \text{in}
\]

Now, divide:

\[
\sigma = \frac{937,500}{15} = 62,500 \, \text{psi}
\]

Thus, the stress in the saw is \( 62,500 \, \text{psi} \), which corresponds to option **E**.

Answer: E
