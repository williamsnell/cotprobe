Okay, so I've got this problem about an effusion cell, and I need to figure out how much the mass of the solid decreases over an hour. Hmm, effusion cells... I remember that effusion relates to the rate at which gas escapes through a small hole. Oh right, Graham's law has something to do with effusion rates, but wait, I think the formula for the effusion rate is based on the molar mass and pressure.

The question gives me the diameter of the hole, which is 1.50 mm. So the radius would be half of that, which is 0.75 mm, but I should convert that to meters for calculations. Oh wait, yeah, 0.75 mm is 0.00075 meters.

The molar mass is 300 g/mol. Oh wait, I should probably convert that to kg/mol for SI units, so that's 0.300 kg/mol. The vapor pressure is 0.735 Pa at 500 K.

I think the formula for the rate of effusion (mass loss per time) involves the area of the hole, the vapor pressure, and some other constants. Let me try to recall. Oh right, the formula is something like (P * A) / sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T), but wait, I might be mixing up some parts. Or is it derived from the ideal gas law and kinetic theory?

Wait, effusion rate can be calculated using the formula:

mass loss rate = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)) ) * M

Wait, maybe that's not quite right. Let me think step by step. The effusion is about the number of molecules escaping per second. So the molar flux would be related to the pressure and the area.

From kinetic theory, the effusion rate (moles per time) is given by:

Effusion rate (mol/s) = (P * A) / (sqrt(2 * π * M * R * T)) )

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Maybe I should break it down. The root mean square velocity comes into play here.

Wait, another approach: The formula for the rate of effusion (in mass per time) is:

mass loss rate = (P * A) * sqrt(M / (2 * π * R * T)) )

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to find the correct formula.

I recall that the molar flux (moles per area per time) is (P)/(sqrt(2 π M R T)). So the total moles per time would be this flux multiplied by the area A. Then, to get mass, multiply by molar mass.

So putting it all together:

mass loss per time (in grams per second) = (P * A) / sqrt(2 π M R T) ) * M / (1000) [since M is in g/mol, but SI uses kg]

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of SI units. Let's make sure all units are consistent.

Molar mass M is given as 300 g/mol = 0.3 kg/mol.

R is the gas constant, 8.314 J/(mol·K).

T is 500 K.

P is 0.735 Pa.

Area A is pi r squared. The diameter is 1.50 mm, so radius is 0.75 mm = 0.00075 m.

So A = π * (0.00075)^2 m².

Now, the molar flux (moles per second per square meter) is P/(sqrt(2 π M R T)).

Wait, no, wait. The correct expression for the molar flux (Φ) is:

Φ = (P) / (sqrt(2 π M R T)) )

But wait, this is per unit area? Or is it the total? No, wait, effusion is a flux, which is per area. So the total molar rate is Φ multiplied by the area A.

So the molar rate (moles per second) = (P * A) / sqrt(2 π M R T) )

Then, to get mass loss per second, multiply by molar mass M.

Wait, but M is in kg/mol, so when you multiply, you get kg/s. Then convert to grams.

So putting it all together:

mass loss rate (g/s) = (P * A * M) / (sqrt(2 π M R T)) )

Wait, that seems a bit circular. Let me calculate each part step by step.

First, compute the area A:

A = π * (0.00075 m)^2 = π * (5.625e-7) m² ≈ 1.767e-6 m².

Next, compute the denominator term sqrt(2 π M R T):

M is 0.3 kg/mol, R=8.314 J/(mol·K), T=500 K.

So 2 * π * M * R * T = 2 * π * 0.3 * 8.314 * 500.

Let me compute that:

0.3 *8.314=2.4942, then *500=1247.1, *2=2494.2, *pi≈2494.2*3.1416≈7825. So sqrt(7825) is about 88.4 (since 88^2=7744 and 89^2=7921; 88.4^2 is around 7818, close enough).

So denominator is about 88.4.

Now, the numerator is P * A * M.

Wait, P is in Pascals (N/m²), A is m², so P*A is N·m/m² * m²? Wait, no, P is in N/m², so P*A is (N/m²) * m² = N. But wait, what units are we using here?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula correctly. Let's make sure.

Wait, the molar flux Φ is (P) / (sqrt(2 π M R T)).

But wait, Φ has units of mol/(m²·s), because it's a flux (per area per time).

So the total moles per second is Φ times A:

moles/s = (P/(sqrt(2 π M R T))) ) * A.

Then, mass loss rate is (moles/s) * M (kg/mol) → kg/s.

Wait, that makes sense.

So let me compute each part:

Compute denominator: sqrt(2 π M R T) = sqrt(2 * π * 0.3 * 8.314 * 500).

Calculating inside the sqrt:

2 * π ≈6.2832.

6.2832 * 0.3 = 1.88496.

1.88496 *8.314≈15.696.

15.696 *500=7834.8.

So sqrt(7834.8)≈88.5 (since 88^2=7744, 89^2=7921. 88.5^2≈7832.25, which is close to 7834.8. So approximately 88.5.

So denominator is ≈88.5.

Now compute numerator: P*A.

P=0.735 Pa. A=π*(0.00075)^2 = π*(5.625e-7) ≈1.767e-6 m².

So P*A = 0.735 *1.767e-6 ≈1.298e-6 N·s/m² * m²? Wait, no, P is in Pa=N/m², so P*A is (N/m²) * m² = N. Wait, but I'm not sure how that plays into the formula. Let me think.

Wait, the formula for molar flux is P/(sqrt(2 pi M R T)) ), which has units:

P in Pa = kg/(m·s²), denominator in sqrt((kg/mol) * (J/(mol·K)) * K) ) → sqrt( (kg/(mol)) * (kg·m²/(s²·mol)) * K )? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with units here. Maybe it's easier to proceed with the numbers as given.

So, the molar rate (moles per second) is (P*A) / denominator.

So (0.735 * 1.767e-6) / 88.5 → Let's compute that.

0.735 * 1.767e-6 ≈ 1.298e-6.

Divide by 88.5: 1.298e-6 /88.5 ≈ 1.466e-8 mol/s.

Now, convert this to mass loss per second: multiply by molar mass (0.3 kg/mol → 300 g/mol).

So 1.466e-8 mol/s * 300 g/mol = 4.398e-6 g/s.

Wait, 4.398e-6 grams per second is 4.398 micrograms per second.

Now, per hour, that's 4.398e-6 g/s * 3600 s/hour → 4.398e-6 * 3600 ≈ 1.583e-2 grams. Which is about 15.83 milligrams.

Wait, looking at the options: A is 18, E is 20, G is14, C is16, J is24... Hmm, 15.8 is close to 16 mg, which is option C.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations for any possible error.

Let me recalculate the denominator.

Compute 2 * pi * M * R * T.

M=0.3 kg/mol.

So 2 * pi ≈6.2832.

6.2832 * 0.3 = 1.88496.

1.88496 *8.314 = Let's compute this: 8 *1.88496=15.07968; 0.314*1.88496≈0.592. Total ≈15.67168.

15.67168 *500 =7835.84.

sqrt(7835.84) is about 88.5, as before.

P*A: 0.735 * (pi * (0.75e-3)^2 )

0.75e-3 m is 0.00075 m.

(0.00075)^2 =5.625e-7 m².

pi *5.625e-7 ≈1.767e-6 m².

0.735 * 1.767e-6 ≈1.298e-6.

So (P*A)=1.298e-6.

Divide by 88.5 → 1.298e-6 /88.5≈1.466e-8 mol/s.

Multiply by M=300 g/mol →1.466e-8 *300 =4.398e-6 g/s.

Multiply by 3600 s →4.398e-6 *3600 →0.0158328 g →15.8328 mg.

So about 15.83 mg. The closest option is C:16 mg.

But wait, let me check if I missed a factor somewhere. Another approach: perhaps the formula requires using the radius in the area correctly.

Wait, area A is correct: pi*r², and with r=0.75 mm =0.00075 m, so area is correct.

Another thing: perhaps I forgot to consider the hole's area correctly, but I think I did that.

Wait, another possible mistake: the formula for effusion. Maybe the correct formula includes a factor of sqrt(3), or perhaps I mixed up the formula.

Wait, another version of the formula for the effusion rate is:

mass loss rate = (P * A * sqrt(M)) ) / (sqrt(2 π R T) * (2)) )

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula.

Wait, the correct formula for the mass effusion rate is:

mass rate = (P * A * M) / (sqrt(2 π M R T)) )

Which is what I used. So the calculation seems correct.

Hmm, but the options don't have exactly 15.8, but option C is 16 mg, which is very close. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again because sometimes factors like the hole being considered as an orifice with a certain discharge coefficient, but I think that's beyond basic effusion and is not considered here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recompute the numbers.

Compute P*A:

0.735 Pa * 1.767e-6 m² = 0.735 * 1.767e-6.

0.735 *1.767 ≈1.298, so 1.298e-6 Pa·m². Since Pa is N/m², so 1.298e-6 N/m² * m² =1.298e-6 N.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct way to look at it. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the formula in terms of molar flux.

Wait, maybe another approach. The molar flux (mol/m²/s) is (P)/(sqrt(2 π M R T)).

So then the total moles per second is flux * A.

Flux = 0.735 / sqrt(2 * pi * 0.3 * 8.314 *500) )

Compute denominator: same as before, sqrt(7835.84)=88.5.

So flux =0.735 /88.5 ≈8.31e-3 mol/(m²·s).

Total moles per second = flux * A =8.31e-3 *1.767e-6 →1.468e-8 mol/s.

Mass per second =1.468e-8 * 0.3 kg/mol →4.404e-9 kg/s →4.404e-6 g/s.

Over 3600 seconds:4.404e-6 *3600=0.0158344 g →15.83 mg. So again, 15.83 mg, which is about 16 mg. So option C.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 16 mg, but I have 15.83. So that's correct.

But wait, let me make sure that I didn't forget to convert units correctly. For example, the molar mass was given in g/mol, and I used kg/mol. Wait, let me check that.

Wait, in the denominator's formula, M is in kg/mol because R is in J/(mol·K) which uses kg. So yes, I converted 300 g/mol to 0.3 kg/mol correctly.

Yes, that seems correct.

To determine the mass decrease of the solid in the effusion cell over 1 hour, we use the formula for the mass loss rate:

\[
\text{Mass loss rate (g/s)} = \frac{P \cdot A \cdot M}{\sqrt{2 \pi M R T}}
\]

### Given Data:
- Diameter of the hole: \(1.50 \, \text{mm} \implies \text{Radius} = 0.75 \, \text{mm} = 0.00075 \, \text{m}\)
- Molar mass: \(M = 300 \, \text{g/mol} = 0.3 \, \text{kg/mol}\)
- Vapor pressure: \(P = 0.735 \, \text{Pa}\)
- Temperature: \(T = 500 \, \text{K}\)
- Gas constant: \(R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)}\)

### Step 1: Calculate the area of the hole
The area of the circular hole is:

\[
A = \pi r^2 = \pi (0.00075)^2 = \pi (5.625 \times 10^{-7}) \approx 1.767 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the denominator
The denominator is:

\[
\sqrt{2 \pi M R T} = \sqrt{2 \cdot \pi \cdot 0.3 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 500}
\]

First, compute the term inside the square root:

\[
2 \cdot \pi \cdot 0.3 \cdot 8.314 \cdot 500 \approx 7835.84
\]

Now, take the square root:

\[
\sqrt{7835.84} \approx 88.5
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the numerator
The numerator is:

\[
P \cdot A \cdot M = 0.735 \cdot 1.767 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 300
\]

First, compute \(P \cdot A\):

\[
0.735 \cdot 1.767 \times 10^{-6} \approx 1.298 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Now, multiply by \(M\):

\[
1.298 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 300 \approx 3.894 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{g/s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mass loss rate
The mass loss rate is:

\[
\text{Mass loss rate (g/s)} = \frac{3.894 \times 10^{-4}}{88.5} \approx 4.398 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{g/s}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the mass loss over 1 hour
Convert seconds to hours (\(1 \, \text{hour} = 3600 \, \text{seconds}\)):

\[
\text{Mass loss (g)} = 4.398 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 3600 \approx 0.01583 \, \text{g} = 15.83 \, \text{mg}
\]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to \(15.83 \, \text{mg}\) is **16 mg**.
