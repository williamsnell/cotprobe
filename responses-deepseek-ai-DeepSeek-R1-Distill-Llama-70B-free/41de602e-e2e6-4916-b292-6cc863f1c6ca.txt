Question:

 What two problems does individualism lead us into, according to Hourdequin?

Options:

A: They lead us into "tragedy of the commons" situations and they instill in us an atomistic view of persons.
B: It leads to a decline in societal values and the rise of selfish behavior.
C: It encourages a culture of isolation and self-centeredness, and leads to a lack of community engagement.
D: It leads to the breakdown of social structures and the erosion of collective responsibility.
E: It leads to increased greenhouse gas emissions and increased consumption of non-recyclable goods.
F: It leads to a lack of empathy and understanding of others, and an increase in individualistic behavior.
G: It results in increased consumption and waste, and a disregard for the environment.
H: It leads to failures of developing integration and integrality.
I: We both tend to think of our moral obligations as only personal obligations, and so think that we can only advocate for policy in "tragedy of the commons" situations.
J: It promotes competition over cooperation and leads to societal fragmentation.

Okay, so I have this question about individualism and the problems it causes according to Hourdequin. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that individualism is a philosophy that emphasizes individual freedom and self-reliance. But when it's taken too far, it can cause issues. The question is asking what two specific problems individualism leads to, based on Hourdequin's work.

I think I've heard about the "tragedy of the commons" before. That's the idea where a shared resource gets overused because each individual acts in their own self-interest, leading to depletion. So that's one problem. But what's the other?

I also recall that individualism can lead to an atomistic view of persons. Atomistic means seeing people as isolated individuals without considering their connections to the community. So this view might ignore the importance of social bonds and collective well-being.

Looking at the options, option A says it leads to "tragedy of the commons" and an atomistic view. That fits with what I was thinking. Let me check the other options to make sure.

Option B talks about decline in societal values and selfishness. That's a bit vague and maybe related, but not the specific two problems I remember.

Option C mentions isolation and lack of community engagement. That's similar to the atomistic view but phrased differently. Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's exactly what Hourdequin said.

Option D is about breakdown of social structures and erosion of collective responsibility. That's a broader societal impact, but again, not the two specific points.

Option E is about environmental issues like emissions and consumption. That's more of an environmental impact, which could be part of the tragedy of the commons, but not the two distinct problems.

Option F talks about lack of empathy and more individualistic behavior. That's more about personal traits rather than structural issues.

Option G is similar to E, focusing on consumption and disregard for the environment. Again, environmental issues but not the two specific problems I'm thinking of.

Option H mentions failures of integration and integrality. I'm not as familiar with those terms, so maybe not.

Option I talks about moral obligations and policy advocacy. That seems more about how individuals view their responsibilities in policy contexts, not the two main problems.

Option J is about competition over cooperation and societal fragmentation, which ties into the atomistic view but might not be the exact points.

So, putting it all together, the two problems are the tragedy of the commons situations and an atomistic view of persons. So the answer should be option A.

The correct answer is based on identifying the two specific problems individualism leads to, according to Hourdequin. These are the "tragedy of the commons" situations, where shared resources are overused due to self-interest, and an atomistic view of persons, which neglects the importance of community and social connections.
