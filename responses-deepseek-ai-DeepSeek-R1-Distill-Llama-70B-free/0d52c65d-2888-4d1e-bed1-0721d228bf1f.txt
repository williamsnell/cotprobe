Okay, so I've got this question about Hourdequin's argument regarding a flaw in consequentialist calculation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I need to remember what consequentialism is all about. Consequentialist theories, like utilitarianism, argue that the morality of an action should be determined by its outcomes. So, the right action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or minimizes suffering. Got it. 

Now, the question is about Hourdequin pointing out a flaw in this approach. The options are A through J, each presenting a different criticism. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says it negates that individuals are self-interested. Wait, but doesn't consequentialism sometimes align with self-interest? Like, if an action benefits the most people, maybe it's in your self-interest. Or maybe it requires self-sacrifice. I'm not sure if that's the main point here.

Option B: it runs counter to the idea that persons are atomistic and individually rational. Atomistic means seeing people as separate, independent units. Consequentialism does consider the collective good, so maybe it conflicts with treating people as purely individual. But I'm not certain if this is the exact flaw Hourdequin is pointing out.

Option C: it overlooks the conflict between individual and collective interests. That sounds familiar. Consequentialism often focuses on the overall good, which might require individuals to sacrifice their own interests. So maybe this is a flaw because it ignores how individual interests can clash with the collective good. I've heard this criticism before, actually. 

Option D: it can run counter to integrating commitments at various levels. Hmm, not sure about this one. It sounds a bit abstract. Maybe it's about how people balance different levels of commitment, like personal, social, etc. Not sure if this is the main issue here.

Option E: fails to reconcile prima facie duties. Prima facie duties are like initial obligations, right? So this is more of a deontological ethics issue, like in Ross's theory. Consequentialism doesn't really deal with duties in the same way, so maybe this is a possible answer. But I'm not sure if this is what Hourdequin is arguing.

Option F: doesn't consider individuals acting against self-interest. Wait, but consequentialism can account for that. For example, someone might act altruistically, which is against their self-interest but benefits others. So maybe the theory does consider this, making F not the correct answer.

Option G: undermines personal values and beliefs. Well, consequentialism is more about outcomes than personal values. But I think some critics argue that it ignores the importance of personal integrity or values. Not sure if this is the specific flaw Hourdequin points out.

Option H: disregards social norms. Social norms can influence decisions, but I'm not sure if this is the main flaw. Maybe in some cases, but perhaps not the central point.

Option I: fails to recognize persons are best understood in relation to each other. That sounds a bit like a relational view of persons, which is more of a critique from, say, care ethics. If consequentialism treats people atomistically, then this could be a flaw. But does this tie into the calculation problem?

Option J: discredits morally autonomous decisions. Autonomy is about making your own decisions. Consequentialism might require certain actions regardless of personal choice, so maybe it does undermine autonomy. But is this the exact point Hourdequin makes?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again about what each option is saying. The question is about a flaw in the calculation, which I think relates to how consequences are evaluated and the challenges in doing so.

I remember that one of the issues with consequentialism is that it can require considering the overall good, which might lead to situations where individual interests are sacrificed. This creates a conflict between what's good for the individual and what's good for everyone. So that would point towards option C.

Alternatively, another angle is the idea that people are not just isolated individuals but are part of a web of relationships. So if the theory doesn't account for that relational aspect, that's a flaw. That might be option I. But I'm not sure if that's the calculation issue.

Wait, Hourdequin's specific argument—I think I've heard that she criticizes consequentialism for not adequately considering the integration of commitments at different levels. Like, personal, social, etc. So that might be option D. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, another common criticism is that consequentialism can conflict with our intuitive sense of personal duties or obligations, which is more about E. But the question is about the calculation flaw.

Oh, right! The calculation problem in consequentialism often refers to the difficulty in determining the overall consequences of an action. But I think the question is about a specific flaw that Hourdequin points out, which is more about the structure of the theory rather than the practical calculation difficulty.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to recall any specific arguments. I think Hourdequin's criticism is that consequentialist theories can't account for the way persons are interconnected. So, it treats persons as atomistic, separate entities, which might be option B or I.

Option B says it runs counter to persons being atomistic and individually rational. Wait, no—if the theory treats them as atomistic, then maybe the flaw is that it can't handle non-atomistic views. So maybe the theory's approach is that it assumes atomism, and that's a flaw because people are not just individual actors but interconnected.

Alternatively, option I says it fails to recognize that persons are best understood in relation to each other. That would mean the theory's flaw is not considering relational aspects, which is a different criticism than just individual vs. collective interests.

But the question is about the flaw in the calculation itself. So perhaps it's about how the calculation process overlooks something.

Wait, another thought: some critics argue that consequentialism can't reconcile individual moral commitments with the overall good. So, for example, a person might have commitments to family, friends, etc., that the utilitarian calculation doesn't account for. This would make option D the correct answer.

I'm really torn between options C, I, and D. Let me try to think about the exact wording of the options again.

Option C: it overlooks the potential conflict between individual and collective interests.

Option I: it fails to recognize that persons are best understood in relation to one another.

Option D: it can run counter to a person's ability to integrate her commitments at various levels.

Hmm. If the issue is about integrating commitments, like personal, professional, social, etc., then D would make sense. Hourdequin might be arguing that consequentialism doesn't allow for this integration because it focuses solely on the outcome, ignoring how different commitments should be balanced.

Alternatively, option I is about understanding persons relationally, which is a more ontological point about the nature of persons, not necessarily about the calculation process.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is C, D, or I. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another angle: the question is about the flaw in the calculation. So perhaps the problem is that the calculation doesn't account for how individual and collective interests might conflict, making C the correct answer.

But I'm still not 100% confident. I think I remember that Hourdequin's critique is that consequentialism can't handle the integration of different commitments, making D the answer. Alternatively, I'm mixing up different critics.

Alternatively, if the flaw is that it treats people as atomistic, that's option B or I.

I think I'll have to go with option C. Because the conflict between individual and collective is a classic criticism of consequentialism. For example, the utility monster problem is about individual vs. collective interests. So Hourdequin's argument might be pointing this out.

Hourdequin's critique of consequentialist calculation can be analyzed by evaluating the options provided:

- **Option A**: This suggests consequentialism negates the idea that individuals are self-interested. However, consequentialism can align with self-interest in certain scenarios and does not inherently deny it. This is not the primary flaw Hourdequin highlights.

- **Option B**: This argues that consequentialism conflicts with the idea of persons as atomistic and individually rational actors. While consequentialism does focus on collective outcomes, the flaw is not necessarily about treating persons as atomistic but rather about how it handles interconnectedness or integration of commitments.

- **Option C**: This points out that consequentialism overlooks the conflict between individual and collective interests. This is a classic criticism, as consequentialism often prioritizes collective good over individual interests, leading to potential conflicts.

- **Option D**: This suggests that consequentialism cannot account for integrating commitments at various levels (e.g., personal, social). This is a nuanced critique, as consequentialism focuses on outcomes rather than balancing different levels of commitment.

- **Option E**: This refers to the failure to reconcile prima facie duties, which is more relevant to deontological ethics and not directly tied to Hourdequin's critique of consequentialist calculation.

- **Option F**: This argues that consequentialism does not consider individuals acting against self-interest. However, consequentialism can account for altruistic actions, making this less likely to be the flaw.

- **Option G**: This critiques consequentialism for undermining personal values and beliefs. While consequentialism prioritizes outcomes over personal values, this is not the specific flaw Hourdequin emphasizes.

- **Option H**: This suggests that consequentialism disregards social norms. While social norms influence decisions, this is not the central flaw in the calculation process.

- **Option I**: This argues that consequentialism fails to recognize that persons are best understood in relation to one another. This is a relational critique, focusing on interconnectedness, but it is more ontological and less about the calculation process.

- **Option J**: This claims that consequentialism discredits morally autonomous decisions. While consequentialism may require certain actions, this is not the specific flaw tied to the calculation process.

After evaluating the options, **Option C** stands out as the most relevant critique. Hourdequin's argument likely focuses on the conflict between individual and collective interests, a well-known issue in consequentialist theories. This aligns with the idea that consequentialism prioritizes overall outcomes, potentially neglecting individual interests and the conflicts that arise from this dynamic.
