The first nine offered to paint the house for amounts ranging from $10,000 to $12,500. The 10th bid was sent by telegram and was supposed to be for $10,000. However, the telegraph company made a mistake and transmitted the bid as $1,000. The homeowner immediately accepted the 1 0th bid, but the 1 0 painter refused to perform. The I 0th painter's best defense in an action for breach of contract by the homeowner would be

Options:

A: that the homeowner should have been aware of the mistaken transmission, because of the disparity between its bid and the others.
B: that the telegraph company should be liable as an independent contractor.
C: that the homeowner deliberately exploited the telegraph company's mistake.
D: that the telegraph company's mistake nullifies the contractual agreement.
E: that the homeowner's immediate acceptance of the bid was unreasonable.
F: that the discrepancy between the bid and the actual cost of painting is too large.
G: that the mistake made the contract unconscionable.
H: that the homeowner was under an affirmative duty to investigate all submitted bids.
I: that the bid was not legally binding as it was sent via telegram.
J: that the homeowner failed to provide accurate specifications for the job.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically dealing with mistakes in offers. Let me try to break it down.

The scenario is a homeowner who wants his house painted. He gets ten bids. The first nine are between $10k and $12.5k. The tenth bid was supposed to be $10k, but the telegraph company messed up and sent it as $1k. The homeowner accepted the $1k bid, but the painter refused to do the work. Now, the homeowner is suing for breach of contract, and the painter is defending.

The question is about the painter's best defense. The options are from A to J, each presenting a different legal argument.

I remember that in contract law, a mistake can sometimes make a contract voidable or void. There's a difference between a unilateral mistake and a mutual mistake. Here, the mistake was in the transmission, so it's the painter's bid that was wrong.

In the case of a unilateral mistake, the party who made the mistake might be able to avoid the contract if the other party knew or should have known about the mistake. So, the painter would argue that the homeowner either knew or should have known that $1k was a mistake, given that all other bids were around $10k.

Looking at the options, option A says that the homeowner should have been aware because of the disparity between the bid and the others. That makes sense because a bid that's way lower than others is a red flag. If the homeowner didn't realize that, maybe they should have.

Option E says the acceptance was unreasonable. I think that's similar but maybe not as precise. Unreasonable acceptance might tie into whether they should have known about the mistake.

Option G mentions the contract being unconscionable. Unconscionability is when the terms are so one-sided they shock the conscience. But here, the issue is mistake, not unconscionability. So G might not be the best fit.

Option A seems stronger because it's about the homeowner's awareness of the mistake. The painter's defense would hinge on the homeowner being on notice that the bid was a mistake due to the significant difference from the others.

I think the best defense here is that the homeowner should have been aware of the mistake because the bid was way too low compared to the others. So the answer should be A.

The correct answer is A. The painter's best defense is that the homeowner should have been aware of the telegraph company's mistake due to the significant disparity between the $1,000 bid and the other bids, which ranged from $10,000 to $12,500. This awareness would imply that the homeowner knew or should have known the bid was a mistake, making the contract voidable.
