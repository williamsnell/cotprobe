Okay, so I've got this problem here about temperature conversions, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the formulas, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says the temperature of a gas is -10°C, and we need to find the equivalent in Fahrenheit and Kelvin. There are multiple choices, so maybe I can figure it out by remembering the conversion formulas.

First, I think I'll tackle the Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion. I remember that the formula is F = (C * 9/5) + 32. Let me plug in -10 for C.

So, F = (-10 * 9/5) + 32. Let's calculate that. -10 multiplied by 9 is -90, divided by 5 gives -18. Then add 32. So -18 +32 is 14. Oh, so Fahrenheit would be 14°F. That seems right because I've heard that -10°C is like 14°F. 

Wait, wait, but I should double-check that calculation. Let me do it again. -10 times 9 is -90, divided by 5 is -18. Adding 32 gives 14. Yep, that's correct. So Fahrenheit is 14°F.

Now for the Kelvin part. I know that to convert Celsius to Kelvin, you just add 273.15. So K = C + 273.15. Since the temperature is -10°C, adding 273.15 gives 263.15K. Usually, in these problems, they might round it to the nearest whole number, so 263K.

Wait, but sometimes I've seen 273.16 as the exact conversion. Either way, adding -10 to 273.15 gives 263.15. So yeah, 263K.

Now let me look at the options. The question asks for Fahrenheit and Kelvin. So I have F as 14 and K as 263.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 14°F and 263K. Oh, that seems to fit. Let me check the other options just to be sure. Option C has 14°F but 283K, which is way higher. Option F has 14°F and 253K. No, 263 is correct. So option B is the one.

To convert a temperature of -10°C to Fahrenheit and Kelvin:

1. **Celsius to Fahrenheit**:  
   The formula is:  
   \[
   F = \left(C \times \frac{9}{5}\right) + 32
   \]  
   Substituting \( C = -10 \):  
   \[
   F = \left(-10 \times \frac{9}{5}\right) + 32 = -18 + 32 = 14
   \]  
   Therefore, \( F = 14^\circ\text{F} \).

2. **Celsius to Kelvin**:  
   The formula is:  
   \[
   K = C + 273.15
   \]  
   Substituting \( C = -10 \):  
   \[
   K = -10 + 273.15 = 263.15 \approx 263 \, \text{K}
   \]

From the given options, the correct match is **14°F and 263K**, which corresponds to **Option B**.
