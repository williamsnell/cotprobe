Okay, so I have this question about the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and I need to figure out the correct answer from the options given. Let me start by recalling what I know about this act.

I remember that the Voting Rights Act was a significant piece of legislation in the United States, aimed at overcoming legal barriers that prevented African Americans from voting, especially in the South. It was part of the broader civil rights movement.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Prohibited the use of poll taxes in federal elections. I think I remember that the 24th Amendment to the Constitution, which was ratified in 1964, prohibited the federal and state governments from denying the right to vote due to a poll tax in federal elections. But wasn't the Voting Rights Act related to this as well? Maybe it enforced it further or addressed it in some way. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the 24th Amendment was the main one for poll taxes.

Option B: Granted women the right to vote. No, that was the 19th Amendment, passed in 1920. So this isn't correct.

Option C: Granted African-Americans the right to vote. Wait, wasn't the 15th Amendment (1870) supposed to do that? It said that the right to vote couldn't be denied based on race. But in reality, many Southern states used Jim Crow laws, literacy tests, and other methods to prevent African Americans from voting. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was meant to enforce the 15th Amendment by eliminating these barriers. So while the 15th granted the right, the VRA actually made that right a reality. So option C might be correct in a way, but I'm not certain if it's the best answer or if another option is more precise.

Option D: Required states to provide bilingual ballots. I think the VRA was expanded later, maybe in 1975, to include provisions for language minorities. So this might not be part of the original 1965 Act. I'm not sure if it's this one or a later amendment.

Option E: Granted Native Americans the right to vote. I believe Native Americans were granted citizenship and voting rights through the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, but some states still prevented them from voting. The VRA might have helped, but I don't think it was the main focus. So probably not the correct answer.

Option F: Suspended the use of literacy tests at voting centers. I'm pretty sure the VRA addressed literacy tests. It either banned them or restricted their use. I think it did suspend literacy tests in certain states, especially those with a history of discrimination. So this might be correct.

Option G: Granted the right to vote to individuals 18 years and older. That was the 26th Amendment in 1971, so not related to the VRA of 1965.

Option H: Banned age-based discrimination in voting. Again, that's the 26th Amendment, so not this one.

Option I: Allowed non-citizens to vote. I don't think so. The VRA was about ensuring citizens could vote without barriers, not about non-citizens.

So, putting it all together. The VRA of 1965 mainly targeted barriers like literacy tests and poll taxes, especially in states that had historically disenfranchised African Americans. It also authorized federal oversight to enforce these changes.

Looking back at the options, option A says it prohibited poll taxes in federal elections. The 24th Amendment did that, but the VRA might have enforced it more or in other areas. Alternatively, option F talks about suspending literacy tests. I think the VRA did suspend literacy tests in covered jurisdictions, so F could be correct.

Wait, let me think again. The VRA of 1965 suspended the use of literacy tests in states that had historically low voter turnout, mainly in the South. So F might be correct. But I'm a bit confused because I thought it was more about banning them outright, but maybe it was a suspension that led to their abolition.

Alternatively, option C says it granted African Americans the right to vote. But technically, the 15th Amendment already granted that right. The VRA was about enforcement. So option C isn't entirely accurate because it wasn't granting the right but ensuring it could be exercised.

So then, looking back, the correct answer might be A or F. Wait, the 24th Amendment prohibited poll taxes in federal elections, but the VRA went further, perhaps in state elections as well? Or maybe the VRA didn't directly prohibit poll taxes but addressed other barriers.

I think option F is correct because the VRA did target literacy tests. It suspended their use in states with a history of voter discrimination. So the answer would be F.

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a landmark legislation aimed at eliminating barriers that prevented African Americans from voting, particularly in the South. It enforced the 15th Amendment by targeting discriminatory practices such as literacy tests. While the 24th Amendment prohibited poll taxes in federal elections, the Voting Rights Act focused on suspending literacy tests in states with a history of voter discrimination. Therefore, the correct answer is:

F: suspended the use of literacy tests at voting centers.

Answer: F
