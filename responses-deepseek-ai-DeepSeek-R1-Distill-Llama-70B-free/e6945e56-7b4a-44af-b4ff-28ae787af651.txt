Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about average and marginal costs. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the total cost of producing x cameras is given by the function C(x) = 2 + x^3. I need to find the average cost when 10 cameras are made and also the marginal cost of producing those 10 cameras. Oh right, I remember that average cost is total cost divided by the number of units, and marginal cost is the derivative of the total cost function at that point.

Wait, let me think again. Average cost (AC) is calculated as AC = C(x)/x. And marginal cost (MC) is the derivative of C with respect to x, which gives the additional cost of producing one more unit. So that's correct.

So first, let's plug in x=10 into the total cost function to find the total cost when producing 10 cameras. C(10) = 2 + (10)^3. 10 cubed is 1000, so 2 + 1000 is 1002. So the total cost is $1002.

Then, the average cost per unit would be total cost divided by the number of units. That's 1002 divided by 10, which is 100.2. Hmm, so that's $100.2 per unit. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, none of them have 100.2 exactly, but let's see: option A says average cost $1000, which is way higher. Option B is $300, which doesn't match. Option D is $102, which is close to 100.2, but not exact. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate. 10^3 is 1000, plus 2 is 1002. Divided by 10 is 100.2. So 100.2 is the average cost. Looking again, none of the options exactly give 100.2. Hmm. Oh wait, maybe I should look for the closest option. Let me check the options again.

Option D says average cost $102. Hmm, that's a bit higher. Option J is $100. So maybe I should reconsider. Or did I miscalculate something else.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the marginal cost. Let's compute that. The marginal cost is the derivative of C(x). So C(x)=2 + x^3. The derivative is C'(x)= 3x^2. So when x=10, C'(10)= 3*(10)^2=3*100=300. So marginal cost is $300 per unit.

Now, looking at the options, let me see which one has average cost around 100 and marginal cost 300. Option J says average cost $100, marginal cost $300. That matches exactly. So that must be the correct option.

Wait, but earlier I thought the average cost was 100.2, but option J says exactly $100. Hmmm. Could I have made a mistake in the average cost calculation? Let me recheck. 10^3 is 1000, plus 2 is 1002. Divide by 10: 1002/10 is 100.2. So that's $100.2 per camera. But none of the options have that. Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I missed one. Let's read them again.

Looking at the options:

A: AC 1000, MC 100
B: AC 300, MC 100
C: AC 300, MC 1000
D: AC 102, MC 301
E: AC 500, MC 1000
F: AC 100, MC 100
G: AC 200, MC 300
H: AC 2, MC 30
I: AC 1020, MC 299
J: AC 100, MC 300

So option J has AC $100 and MC $300. Hmm. But according to my calculation, the AC is $100.2. Wait, perhaps the question expects us to approximate. Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the total cost. C(10)=2 + 10^3=2+1000=1002. So that's correct. Divided by 10 is 100.2, so AC is $100.2. None of the options have that. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the problem. Oh wait, perhaps it's a trick question where the marginal cost at x=10 is C'(10)=300, and the average cost is 100.2, but the closest option is J, which is AC 100 and MC 300. So maybe the intended answer is J, even though the average is 100.2.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the total cost calculation. Let me check again: C(x)=2 +x^3, x=10. 10^3 is 1000, plus 2 is 1002. Divide by 10 is 100.2. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, none have 100.2, so perhaps the question intended a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the average cost correctly and see if any of the options match.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the average cost is 100.2, which is approximately 100. So the closest option is J, which has AC $100 and MC $300. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects exact values, but the options don't have that. So maybe J is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the marginal cost calculation. Let me check: C'(x)=3xÂ². At x=10, that's 3*100=300. So that's correct.

So the only option that matches MC $300 is option J and option C. Option C has AC $300, which isn't right. So the correct answer should be J, even though AC is 100.2, but perhaps they rounded it to 100.

So I think the correct answer is J.

The total cost of producing \( x \) cameras is given by the function \( C(x) = 2 + x^3 \). To find the average cost when 10 cameras are produced, we calculate:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = C(10) = 2 + 10^3 = 2 + 1000 = 1002
\]

The average cost (AC) is then:

\[
\text{AC} = \frac{C(x)}{x} = \frac{1002}{10} = 100.2
\]

Next, to find the marginal cost (MC), we take the derivative of the total cost function:

\[
C'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(2 + x^3) = 3x^2
\]

At \( x = 10 \):

\[
\text{MC} = C'(10) = 3 \cdot 10^2 = 3 \cdot 100 = 300
\]

Thus, the average cost is $100.2 and the marginal cost is $300. Among the given options, the closest match is:

- **Option J**: Average Cost: $100/unit, Marginal Cost: $300

Although the exact average cost is $100.2, the problem likely expects rounding to the nearest dollar. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**J: Average Cost: $100/unit, Marginal Cost: $300**

Answer: J
