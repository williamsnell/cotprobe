Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy change (ΔH) for a reaction at 25°C. Hmm, let's see what the question says. The reaction is CO(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → CO2(g), and the given ΔH is -67.4 Kcal. Wait, no, the question mentions ΔE instead. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me read it again.

Oh, wait, the question says ΔE is -67.4 Kcal. Hmm, but I thought the standard way to present enthalpy change is ΔH, not ΔE. Oh wait, maybe ΔE here refers to the change in energy, perhaps the internal energy? Or is it a typo? Because in thermodynamics, ΔH is the enthalpy change, and ΔE is the internal energy change. But wait, the question is asking for ΔH, so I need to find that.

Wait a second, the reaction is CO plus half O2 forming CO2. I remember that standard enthalpies of formation can be used here. Each substance has a standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°), and the reaction's ΔH is calculated as the sum of the products' ΔHf° minus the sum of the reactants'.

Right, so the formula is ΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants). 

So for the reaction: CO(g) + ½ O2(g) → CO2(g), the products are CO2, and the reactants are CO and O2.

Wait, what are the standard enthalpies of formation for these substances? I think O2 is an element in its standard form, so its ΔHf° is zero. CO and CO2 have specific values.

I remember that the ΔHf° for CO(g) is about -26.4 Kcal/mol, but wait, I might be mixing up the numbers. Or was it positive? Wait, no, wait. CO is formed from C and O, so its ΔHf° is endothermic because it's taking elements to make a compound. So I think CO's ΔHf° is positive. Wait, no, wait, no, wait... Let's think: Most formation enthalpies are exothermic, except for some. Wait, maybe CO's is positive. Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. For example, methane's ΔHf° is negative because it's exothermic. CO is a stable molecule, so I think its ΔHf° is negative. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall some exact values. But I'm a bit stuck here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different approach.

Wait, but the problem provides ΔE as -67.4 Kcal. So maybe the question is considering ΔE as the change in internal energy (ΔU), and we're supposed to find ΔH from that. Because I remember that ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n)RT, where Δn is the change in moles of gas.

Wait, that makes sense. Because for reactions involving gases, the change in the number of moles affects ΔH and ΔU differently. So if we have ΔU (which is ΔE here), we can calculate ΔH.

Okay, so let's think about that approach. So the reaction is CO(g) + ½ O2(g) → CO2(g). Let's calculate Δn, the change in moles of gas.

Reactants: CO is 1 mole, O2 is ½ mole. So total moles = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 moles.

Products: CO2 is 1 mole.

So Δn = moles of gaseous products - moles of gaseous reactants = 1 - 1.5 = -0.5 moles.

Now, the formula is ΔH = ΔU + Δn_gas * R * T.

Wait, but wait: I think the correct formula is ΔH = ΔU + Δn_gas * R*T, where Δn is the change in moles of gas. Because for ideal gases, the enthalpy change is related to the internal energy change plus the work done (which involves pressure and volume changes).

So, in this case, R is the gas constant. Now, temperature is given at 25°C, which is 298 K. So T is 298 K.

Now, let's plug in the numbers. But wait, what units are we using? The given ΔE is in Kcal, so we'll need to make sure R is in the same units. The gas constant R is usually 8.314 J/mol·K, but sometimes in calories, it's 1.987 cal/mol·K. Since our ΔE is in Kcal, let's convert R to Kcal units.

So R = 1.987 cal/(mol·K) = 0.001987 Kcal/(mol·K). So at T=298 K, R*T = 0.001987 * 298 ≈ 0.592 Kcal/mol.

Wait, 0.001987 * 300 would be about 0.5961, so at 298, it's approximately 0.592.

So Δn is -0.5. So Δn * R*T = (-0.5) * 0.592 ≈ -0.296 Kcal/mol. So approximately -0.296 Kcal.

Now, ΔH = ΔU + Δn*R*T. Wait, but wait, wait! I think I might have the formula wrong. Because I remember that ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n_gas) * R*T. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, in the formula, for each mole of gas reacting, you have to consider the change. So yes, in this case, Δn is -0.5, so the term is -0.5 * R*T.

Wait, but wait, ½ O2 is a reactant. So in the stoichiometric calculation, O2 is diatomic, so ½ mole is correct.

So, given that ΔE is -67.4 Kcal, which is ΔU. So ΔH = ΔU + (Δn) * R*T.

So ΔH = (-67.4) + (-0.296) ≈ -67.696 Kcal. Which is approximately -67.7 Kcal.

Looking at the options, option C is -67.7 Kcal. So the correct answer should be C.

But wait, let me double-check my approach. Because sometimes the reaction's ΔH is directly given, but in this case, the problem states ΔE is -67.4 Kcal. So I think my approach is correct, using ΔH = ΔE + Δn*R*T.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the standard enthalpy of formation, but I don't recall the exact values. So perhaps that approach would involve:

ΔH° = [ΔHf°(CO2)] - [ΔHf°(CO) + ½ ΔHf°(O2)].

But since O2 is an element, ΔHf°(O2) = 0. So it's ΔHf°(CO2) - ΔHf°(CO).

If I use standard values, for example, ΔHf° for CO is about +26.4 Kcal/mol? Or wait, wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, the standard enthalpy of formation for CO(g) is actually around -26.4 Kcal/mol, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think CO's ΔHf° is positive because it's less stable than CO2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, CO2 is more stable, so its ΔHf° is more negative than CO's. So for CO, I think the ΔHf° is about -26.4 Kcal/mol, and for CO2, it's about -94.0 Kcal/mol.

So if that's the case, then ΔH° would be (-94.0) - [ (-26.4) + 0 ] = (-94.0) +26.4 = -67.6 Kcal. Which is approximately -67.6, close to option C's -67.7, but wait, that would be similar to the first method.

Wait, so if that's the case, then perhaps the question is simply giving the standard ΔH as -67.4 Kcal, but the options have -67.4 as option H, and the calculation through formation gives -67.6, which is close to option C, -67.7.

But wait, the question says calculate ΔH, and the given is ΔE = -67.4 Kcal. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the given ΔH is -67.4 Kcal, but the options have that as option H.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again. The question says: "Calculate ∆H for the reaction at 25°C. CO(g) + (1/2)O_2 (g) → CO_2 (g). ∆E = - 67.4 Kcal." So the question is asking for ∆H, but the given is ∆E = -67.4 Kcal.

So in that case, using the first approach where ΔH = ΔE + Δn*R*T, which gave us approximately -67.7 Kcal, which is option C.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about using the standard enthalpies of formation, I got around -67.6. So both approaches are giving me about the same answer, option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the sign. Let me think again about the formula.

Wait, the formula is ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n_gas) * R*T. So ΔU is -67.4 Kcal.

Δn is (moles products gas) - (moles reactants gas) = 1 - (1 + 0.5) = 1 - 1.5 = -0.5.

So Δn is -0.5. So Δ(n)*R*T is (-0.5) * (0.001987 Kcal/mol·K) * 298 K.

0.001987 * 298 ≈ 0.592 Kcal/mol. So 0.5 * 0.592 is 0.296, but with the negative sign, it's -0.296.

So ΔH = (-67.4) + (-0.296) = -67.696 Kcal ≈ -67.7 Kcal.

So the correct answer is option C: -67.7 Kcal.

To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction at 25°C, we start with the given internal energy change (ΔE) of -67.4 Kcal. The relationship between ΔH and ΔE is given by:

\[
\Delta H = \Delta U + \Delta n \cdot R \cdot T
\]

Here:
- \( \Delta n \) is the change in moles of gas,
- \( R \) is the gas constant (0.001987 Kcal/(mol·K)),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin (298 K for 25°C).

The reaction is:

\[
\text{CO(g) + } \frac{1}{2} \text{O}_2\text{(g)} \rightarrow \text{CO}_2\text{(g)}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta n \)
- Moles of gaseous reactants: \( 1 + \frac{1}{2} = 1.5 \)
- Moles of gaseous products: \( 1 \)
- \( \Delta n = \text{moles of products} - \text{moles of reactants} = 1 - 1.5 = -0.5 \)

### Step 2: Calculate \( \Delta n \cdot R \cdot T \)
\[
\Delta n \cdot R \cdot T = (-0.5) \cdot (0.001987) \cdot (298) \approx -0.296 \, \text{Kcal}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \Delta H \)
\[
\Delta H = \Delta U + \Delta n \cdot R \cdot T = (-67.4) + (-0.296) \approx -67.7 \, \text{Kcal}
\]

### Final Answer:
The calculated enthalpy change (ΔH) for the reaction is approximately **-67.7 Kcal**, which corresponds to **option C**.
