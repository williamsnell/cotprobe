Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Poynting vector and the electric field in a light wave. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says: A light wave is traveling in glass with an index of refraction of 1.5. The amplitude of the electric field is 100 volts/meter. We need to find the magnitude of the Poynting vector. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, what's the Poynting vector again? I remember it's related to the power per unit area carried by an electromagnetic wave. The formula, if I'm not mistaken, is the cross product of the electric field E and the magnetic field B. So the magnitude should be E multiplied by B because they're perpendicular, right? Oh wait, but wait, in the formula, it's S = (1/μ₀) * E × B. But when dealing with electromagnetic waves, there's a relation between E and B.

Oh right, in an electromagnetic wave, the electric and magnetic fields are related by E = cB, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Or wait, wait. Actually, c is 1/(sqrt(μ₀ ε₀)), and in the wave, E and B are in phase and perpendicular. So E = cB. But wait, when the wave is in a medium, like glass here, the speed changes.

So let me think again. The wave is in glass, which has a refractive index n = 1.5. The speed of light in the medium is v = c/n. So v = (3e8 m/s)/1.5 = 2e8 m/s.

But how does that tie into E and B? Oh, in the medium, the relation between E and B is still E = v B. Because the wave propagates with velocity v, so B is E divided by v.

Wait, no. Wait, in a vacuum, E and B are related by E = c B. So in a medium, E = v B, because the speed is v, which is c/n. So B = E/(v) = E * n/(c).

So the Poynting vector S is (E × B) / μ₀. Wait, no, wait. S is (E × H), where H is the magnetic field in the material. But in linear materials, H and B are related by B = μ₀ H. So H = B / μ₀. But in non-conductive media, which I think glass is, H = (B)/(μ₀ μ_r), where μ_r is the relative permeability. But glass is non-magnetic, so μ_r is about 1. So H = B/(μ₀).

Wait, but in an electromagnetic wave, the relation between E and H is E = c H, where c is the speed in vacuum. No, wait, no. Wait, the wave in a medium: the speed v is 1/sqrt(μ ε). So E and H are related by E = v H.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing some formulas. Let me try to get this straight.

The Poynting vector S is given by S = E × H (the cross product), and the magnitude is E*H, since they are perpendicular. And the average value of S for a plane wave is (1/2) ε₀ c E₀², but wait, that's in vacuum. Or wait, no, in a medium, the permittivity and permeability change.

Alternatively, another approach: the intensity (average power per unit area) of an electromagnetic wave is given by I = (1/2) ε c E₀², where ε is the absolute permittivity of the medium.

Wait, that's another way to think about it. So the Poynting vector's average value is (1/2) ε c E².

Wait, but wait, in the medium, the speed v is c/n. And ε = ε₀ ε_r, where ε_r is the relative permittivity, which is n² for non-magnetic materials. Because n = sqrt(μ_r ε_r), and since μ_r is 1, n = sqrt(ε_r), so ε_r = n².

So ε = ε₀ n².

Putting it all together, the intensity I (which is the average S) is (1/2) ε v E₀². Because in the medium, the speed is v, and the permittivity is ε.

Wait, let me think again. The general formula for the intensity is I = (1/2) ε c E₀², but wait, when the wave is in a medium, c becomes v. So I = (1/2) ε v E₀².

Wait, no, because when you're in a medium, the wave's speed is v = 1/(sqrt(μ ε)) = c/(sqrt(μ_r ε_r)) ). But since μ_r is 1, v = c/(sqrt(ε_r)) = c/n. Because n = sqrt(ε_r) * sqrt(μ_r), and μ_r=1.

So substituting back, I = (1/2) ε v E².

But ε is ε₀ ε_r, which is ε₀ n².

So I = (1/2) * ε₀ n² * (c/n) * E².

Simplify that: (1/2) ε₀ c n E².

Wait, because n² divided by n is n. So I = (1/2) ε₀ c n E².

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation between E and B in the medium, then calculate S = E × B / μ₀.

Wait, let me try that approach.

The Poynting vector S is (E × B) / μ₀. Since E and B are perpendicular, it's (E B) / μ₀.

But in an electromagnetic wave, E and B are related. In vacuum, E = c B. But in a medium, E = v B, where v is the speed of the wave in the medium.

So v = c/n.

So E = (c/n) B → B = (n E)/c.

So substituting into S: S = (E * (n E / c )) / μ₀.

Which is (n E²) / (c μ₀).

But wait, what's c μ₀? Let me recall that c = 1/sqrt(μ₀ ε₀). So sqrt(μ₀ ε₀) = 1/c.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute c μ₀. Let me compute it numerically.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

μ₀ is 4π × 1e-7 H/m. So 4π is about 12.566, so μ₀ ≈ 1.2566e-6 H/m.

So c μ₀ ≈ 3e8 * 1.2566e-6 ≈ (3 * 1.2566) * 1e2 = 3.77 * 1e2 ≈ 377 Ω. Oh wait, that's the impedance of free space, which is about 377 ohms.

Wait, the impedance of free space, Z₀, is μ₀ c = (4π × 1e-7) * 3e8 = 4π × 3e1 = approx 120π ohms, which is about 377 ohms. So Z₀ = μ₀ c.

So, in the formula for S, S = (n E²) / (μ₀ c) ) = (n E²) / Z₀.

Because Z₀ = μ₀ c, so 1/(μ₀ c) = 1/Z₀.

So S = (n E²) / Z₀.

But wait, this is the instantaneous value, but since the question gives the amplitude of E, and we're probably looking for the average value. Wait, but the question asks for the magnitude of the Poynting vector. Oh wait, for a plane wave, the average Poynting vector is (1/2) E₀ B₀, but let me think again.

Wait, the time-averaged Poynting vector for a plane wave is (1/2) Re(E × H*), but in the case of a plane wave, H is in phase with E, so it's (1/2) E H.

But earlier, I thought S = E × H, and its magnitude is E H. So the average would be (1/2) E H.

Wait, but wait, in a medium, H is B/(μ₀ μ_r), and since μ_r is 1, H = B/μ₀.

And since E = v B, and v = c/n, so B = E n / c.

So H = B / μ₀ = (E n)/( c μ₀ ) = (E n)/( Z₀ ), because Z₀ = μ₀ c.

Wait, so H = (E n)/ Z₀.

So S_avg = (1/2) E H = (1/2) E * (E n)/(Z₀) ) = (1/2) (E² n) / Z₀.

Wait, but let me get the numbers straight.

Z₀ is approx 377 Ω.

So S_avg = (E² n) / (2 Z₀ )

Given E is 100 V/m, n is 1.5.

So plugging in:

S_avg = (100^2 * 1.5) / (2 * 377 )

Compute numerator: 100^2 is 10,000. Multiply by 1.5: 15,000.

Denominator: 2 * 377 is 754.

So 15,000 / 754 ≈ let's compute that.

754 × 19 = 14,326 (because 700*19=13,300; 54*19=1,026; total 14,326)

15,000 - 14,326 = 674.

So 19 with 674/754 left. 674/754 is approximately 0.894. So 19.894.

So approximately 19.894 W/m².

Looking at the options, option A is 19.9 W/m². So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check my approach to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Alternative approach: The intensity I is given by I = (1/2) ε c E², where ε is the permittivity of the medium.

Wait, no, in the medium, the wave speed is v, which is c/n. So the formula I know is I = (1/2) ε v E².

But ε is ε₀ ε_r, and since n² = ε_r (assuming non-magnetic), so ε = ε₀ n².

So substituting, I = (1/2) * ε₀ n² * (c/n) * E².

Simplify:

(1/2) ε₀ c n E².

So that would be the same as the earlier formula.

So plugging in the numbers:

ε₀ is 8.85e-12 F/m.

c is 3e8 m/s.

n is 1.5.

E is 100 V/m.

So I = 0.5 * 8.85e-12 * 3e8 * 1.5 * (100)^2.

Compute step by step.

0.5 * 8.85e-12 = 4.425e-12.

4.425e-12 * 3e8 = 1.3275e-3.

1.3275e-3 * 1.5 = 1.990e-3.

1.990e-3 * (100)^2 = 1.990e-3 * 10,000 = 19.9.

So yes, same result. 19.9 W/m².

So the correct answer is option A.

To determine the magnitude of the Poynting vector for a light wave traveling in glass with a refractive index \( n = 1.5 \) and an electric field amplitude \( E = 100 \, \text{V/m} \), we use the formula for the time-averaged Poynting vector:

\[
S_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon v E^2
\]

Here:
- \( \epsilon \) is the permittivity of the medium, which is related to the permittivity of free space \( \epsilon_0 \) by \( \epsilon = \epsilon_0 n^2 \).
- \( v \) is the speed of light in the medium, given by \( v = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light in a vacuum.
- \( E = 100 \, \text{V/m} \) is the amplitude of the electric field.

### Step 1: Substitute \( \epsilon \) and \( v \) into the formula
Since \( \epsilon = \epsilon_0 n^2 \) and \( v = \frac{c}{n} \), the formula becomes:

\[
S_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 n^2 \frac{c}{n} E^2
\]

Simplify:

\[
S_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 c n E^2
\]

### Step 2: Plug in the known values
- \( \epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \)
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)
- \( n = 1.5 \)
- \( E = 100 \, \text{V/m} \)

Substitute these values:

\[
S_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{2} (8.85 \times 10^{-12}) (3 \times 10^8) (1.5) (100)^2
\]

### Step 3: Perform the calculations
1. Compute \( \frac{1}{2} \times 8.85 \times 10^{-12} = 4.425 \times 10^{-12} \).
2. Multiply by \( 3 \times 10^8 \): \( 4.425 \times 10^{-12} \times 3 \times 10^8 = 1.3275 \times 10^{-3} \).
3. Multiply by \( 1.5 \): \( 1.3275 \times 10^{-3} \times 1.5 = 1.990 \times 10^{-3} \).
4. Multiply by \( 100^2 = 10,000 \): \( 1.990 \times 10^{-3} \times 10,000 = 19.9 \, \text{W/m}^2 \).

### Final Answer
The magnitude of the Poynting vector is approximately \( 19.9 \, \text{W/m}^2 \), which corresponds to option **A**.
