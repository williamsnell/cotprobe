Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the New York State transfer tax, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me different tax rates based on the par value of the stock. Par value is the face value of a share, right? So, the tax per share depends on which range the par value falls into. 

Looking at the rates again:
- For stocks under $5 per share par value, the tax is $0.01 (or 1/4 of a cent) per share.
- Between $5 and $10, it's $0.02 (1/2 a cent) per share.
- From $10 to $20, it's $0.03 (3/4 of a cent) per share.
- And for anything over $20, the tax is $0.05 per share.

In this case, Mr. Carr sold 300 shares, each with a par value of $50. Wait, that's way above $20, so the highest bracket applies here. So each share would have a tax of $0.05.

So the calculation should be straightforward: multiply the number of shares by the tax per share. 

Let me write that out. 300 shares times $0.05 per share. Hmm, 300 times 0.05 is... let me think. 300 * 0.05 is the same as 300 divided by 20, because 0.05 is 5 cents, and 100 cents make a dollar. So 300 divided by 20 is 15. So that's $15 in total tax. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, no. Wait, 0.05 dollars per share times 300 shares. So 300 * 0.05 = 15. Yes, that's $15. So the tax would be $15.

Looking at the options, option D is $15, so that must be the correct answer. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The par value per share is $50, which is definitely over $20, so the correct rate applies. The multiplication seems correct too.

The New York State transfer tax is calculated based on the par value of the stock. Since the par value is $50 per share, which exceeds $20, the applicable tax rate is $0.05 per share. Multiplying this rate by the 300 shares sold gives:

\[
300 \times 0.05 = 15
\]

Thus, the total transfer tax is **$15**.

D: $15

**Answer: D**
