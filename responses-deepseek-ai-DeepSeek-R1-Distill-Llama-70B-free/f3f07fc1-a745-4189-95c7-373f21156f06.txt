Okay, so I've got this problem here about water flowing through a pipe and cooling. Let's see if I can figure this out. Hmm, the question is about heat transfer, right? So I remember that when a fluid flows through a pipe and there's a temperature difference between the fluid and the pipe wall, heat is transferred. The goal is to find the exit temperature of the water.

Alright, the given data: the water's speed is 0.02 m/s. The pipe is 3 meters long and has a diameter of 2.54 cm, which is 0.0254 meters. The wall temperature is 80°C, and the incoming water is at 60°C. So the water is cooler than the wall, meaning heat will flow into the water, warming it up. So the exit temperature should be higher than 60 but less than 80, right?

Wait, but how do I calculate the exact temperature? I remember something about the heat transfer coefficient and the concept of log mean temperature difference. Oh right, for a pipe, the heat transfer can be calculated using the formula Q = (U * A * LMTD), where U is the overall heat transfer coefficient, A is the area, and LMTD is the log mean temperature difference. But wait, wait, maybe I should think about the energy balance approach.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of convective heat transfer. The formula might involve the Reynolds number and Prandtl number to find the Nusselt number, which is used to calculate the convection coefficient. Let me think about each step.

First, I need to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent because that affects the Nusselt number correlation. So the Reynolds number (Re) is (velocity * diameter) / kinematic viscosity. Water's properties... I think at around 60°C, the kinematic viscosity (ν) is about 0.47e-6 m²/s. Let me check that. Oh wait, I might have to remember the value. Alternatively, maybe I can look it up, but since I can't, I'll proceed with what I think is correct.

So Re = (0.02 m/s) * (0.0254 m) / (0.47e-6 m²/s). Let me calculate that. 0.02 * 0.0254 is 0.000508 m²/s. Divided by 0.47e-6 gives roughly 0.000508 / 0.00000047 ≈ around 1081. So Re ≈ 1081. That's below 2300, so the flow is laminar. So the appropriate Nusselt number correlation for laminar flow in a pipe with constant wall temperature is Nu = 3.66. Wait, isn't that the value for fully developed flow and uniform surface temperature? Yes, I think so.

So Nu = h * d / k, where h is the convection coefficient, d is diameter, and k is thermal conductivity. So rearranging, h = (Nu * k) / d. I need the thermal conductivity of water. At around 60°C, k is about 0.65 W/m·K. So h = (3.66 * 0.65) / 0.0254. Let's compute that: 3.66 * 0.65 = 2.379. Divided by 0.0254 gives approximately 93.7 W/m²·K.

So now I have the convection coefficient. Next, the formula for the exit temperature. I think the equation is:

T_exit = T_wall - (T_wall - T_inlet) * exp(- (h * A) / (m * c_p))

Wait, but A is the surface area, and m is the mass flow rate. Let me think. The mass flow rate m is density * velocity * area. So m = ρ * v * A_cross, where A_cross is the cross-sectional area of the pipe. The cross-sectional area A_cross is π * (d/2)^2 = π*(0.0254/2)^2. Let's calculate that. 0.0254/2 is 0.0127 m, squared is about 0.00016129 m². Multiply by π gives approximately 0.0005067 m².

Density of water at 60°C is around 983 kg/m³. So m = 983 kg/m³ * 0.02 m/s * 0.0005067 m². Let's compute that: 983 * 0.02 = 19.66. 19.66 * 0.0005067 ≈ 0.00996 kg/s.

Now, the specific heat capacity c_p for water is about 4186 J/kg·K. 

The area A for heat transfer is the perimeter times the pipe length. The perimeter is π*d, so A = π * d * L. So π * 0.0254 * 3 = approx 0.239 m².

Putting it all into the equation:

T_exit = T_wall - (T_wall - T_inlet) * exp( - (h * A) / (m * c_p) )

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. h is 93.7, A is 0.239 m². So h*A is 93.7 * 0.239 ≈ 22.4 W/K.

m is 0.00996 kg/s, c_p is 4186 J/kg·K. So m*c_p is 0.00996 * 4186 ≈ 41.66 W/K.

So the exponent is - (22.4) / (41.66) ≈ -0.537.

Exp(-0.537) is about 0.584.

So T_exit = 80 - (80 -60) * 0.584 = 80 - 20 *0.584 = 80 - 11.68 = 68.32°C. Wait, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait a minute. Let me double-check each step.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Oh wait, the correct formula might be:

T_exit = T_in + (T_wall - T_in) * (1 - exp(-h*A/(m*c_p)))

Wait, no, the equation I used was correct. Another way to write it is T_exit = T_wall - (T_wall - T_in) * exp(-h*A/(m c_p)). So my approach was correct.

Wait, let me recalculate some of the numbers. Let me go step by step.

First, calculate the Reynolds number.

v = 0.02 m/s.

d = 0.0254 m.

ν for water at 60°C: I think it's about 0.47e-6 m²/s. So Re = (0.02)(0.0254) / 0.47e-6.

0.02 * 0.0254 = 0.000508.

0.000508 / 0.47e-6 = 0.000508 / 0.00000047 ≈ 1081. So Re is about 1081. So laminar flow.

Nu = 3.66, so h = (3.66 * k) / d.

k for water at 60°C is about 0.65 W/m·K.

h = (3.66 * 0.65) / 0.0254 = (2.379) / 0.0254 ≈ 93.66 W/m²·K. That seems right.

Mass flow rate m: m = ρ * A * v.

A is cross-sectional area: π*(d/2)^2.

d=0.0254 m, so radius 0.0127 m.

Area = π*(0.0127)^2 = π * 0.00016129 ≈ 0.0005067 m².

ρ at 60°C is about 983 kg/m³.

So m = 983 * 0.02 m/s * 0.0005067 m².

Calculate 983 * 0.02 = 19.66 kg/m²·s.

19.66 * 0.0005067 ≈ 0.00996 kg/s. Correct.

c_p is 4186 J/kg·K.

So m c_p = 0.00996 * 4186 ≈ 41.66 J/s·K = 41.66 W/K.

h*A is 93.66 * (π * d * L).

Wait, wait, A is the heat transfer area. A = π*d*L.

d=0.0254 m, L=3 m.

So A = π * 0.0254 *3 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.0254 *3.

3*0.0254 = 0.0762, times π (≈3.1416) gives about 0.239 m². So h*A= 93.66 * 0.239 ≈ 22.38 W/K.

So exponent is - (22.38)/(41.66) ≈ -0.537.

exp(-0.537) ≈ 0.584.

So T_exit = 80 - (80 - 60) * 0.584 = 80 - 11.68 = 68.32°C.

Wait, but that's not any of the options. The options are around 70-73°C. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. The correct formula for the exit temperature in a pipe with convection is:

T_exit = T_in + (T_wall - T_in) * [1 - exp(-h*A/(m*c_p))]

Wait, because if the exponent is zero, T_exit would be T_in + (T_wall - T_in)*0, which is correct. As exponent increases, it approaches T_wall. So let me try this version.

So T_exit = 60 + (80-60) * [1 - exp(-22.38/(41.66))]

Which is 60 + 20 * [1 - 0.584] = 60 + 20 * 0.416 = 60 + 8.32 = 68.32°C. Same result. Hmm.

But that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I messed up some other parameter.

Wait, maybe the Nusselt number? Because for a pipe with laminar flow and constant wall temperature, the Nu is 3.66, but only for fully developed flow. If the pipe is not long enough, maybe it's in the developing region. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used a different correlation. Let's think.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is Nu = ( (f/8) * Re ) * Pr^(1/3) ), but that's for turbulent flow, which isn't the case here. Hmm, but wait, for laminar flow, the Nusselt number is 3.66 when the flow is fully developed and the wall temperature is constant. If the pipe isn't long enough, the Nusselt number is higher. Let me think about the hydrodynamic entry length. For laminar flow, the entry length is about 0.05 * Re * d. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe it's L_entry = 0.05 * Re * d. Wait, Re is 1081, d is 0.0254 m. So L_entry = 0.05 * 1081 * 0.0254 ≈ 1.37 meters. Oh wait, the pipe is only 3 meters long, which is longer than the entry length. So the flow is fully developed. So the initial assumption of Nu=3.66 should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the Prandtl number. Nu = 3.66 * (Pr)^(1/3). Wait, no, that's for something else. Or maybe for a different boundary condition. Wait, no. For uniform wall temperature, the Nu is 3.66 regardless of Pr, but that seems unlikely. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the Prandtl number in the Nusselt correlation. Let me check.

Wait, the Nusselt number for a pipe with laminar flow, constant wall temperature, fully developed: Nu = 3.66 * (Pr)^(1/3) ? No, I think that's for a different condition. Wait, no, I think the correct formula is Nu = 3.66 for uniform surface temperature, regardless of Pr. No, that can't be right because Pr affects it.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. For a circular tube with laminar flow, fully developed, under constant wall temperature, the Nusselt number is indeed approximately 3.66, independent of Pr and Re as long as it's fully developed. So I think I was correct the first time.

Hmm, but perhaps the value of the thermal conductivity is different. Wait, if I used the wrong k value, that would affect h. Let me double-check. At 60°C, the thermal conductivity of water is about 0.65 W/m·K. Hmm, maybe I should use the value at the film temperature. Oh right, the film temperature is the average of the inlet and wall temperatures. So film temp T_film = (60 + 80)/2 = 70°C.

So perhaps I should use properties at 70°C. Let me check the values at 70°C.

At 70°C, the kinematic viscosity ν is about 0.40e-6 m²/s. Let me confirm. Yes, I think it's around 0.40e-6.

Thermal conductivity k at 70°C is about 0.68 W/m·K.

Prandtl number Pr at 70°C is approximately 2.56.

So let's recalculate with these values.

First, Re = (v * d) / ν = (0.02 * 0.0254) / 0.40e-6.

0.02 * 0.0254 = 0.000508.

0.000508 / 0.4e-6 = 0.000508 / 0.0000004 = 1270. So Re is 1270, still laminar.

Now, since the flow is fully developed and laminar, Nu is 3.66. So h = (Nu * k)/d = (3.66 * 0.68) / 0.0254.

3.66 * 0.68 = 2.4888.

2.4888 / 0.0254 ≈ 97.95 W/m²·K.

Now, the mass flow rate m: same formula.

m = ρ * A * v.

Density at 70°C is about 977.8 kg/m³. Let me use 978 kg/m³.

A_cross = π*(0.0254/2)^2 ≈ 0.0005067 m².

So m = 978 * 0.02 * 0.0005067.

978 * 0.02 = 19.56.

19.56 * 0.0005067 ≈ 0.00992 kg/s.

c_p at 70°C is about 4197 J/kg·K.

So m c_p = 0.00992 * 4197 ≈ 41.62 W/K.

Now, A is the surface area: π * d * L = π * 0.0254 * 3 ≈ 0.239 m².

h*A = 97.95 * 0.239 ≈ 23.42 W/K.

So exponent is -23.42 / 41.62 ≈ -0.5625.

exp(-0.5625) ≈ e^(-0.5625) ≈ 0.569.

So T_exit = 80 - (80-60)*0.569 = 80 - 11.38 = 68.62°C.

Hmm, so that's about 68.6°C, which is still not matching the options.

Wait, but the options are all over 70°C. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the overall heat transfer coefficient U. Wait, but I calculated h as the convection coefficient, and in this case, since it's water flowing inside and the wall is at a fixed temperature, perhaps U is the same as h. So that's correct.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should use the LMTD method. Let's try that.

The heat transfer Q is given by Q = U * A * LMTD.

But I also have Q = m c_p (T_exit - T_in).

So, equate the two:

m c_p (T_exit - T_in) = U A ( (T_wall - T_in) - (T_wall - T_exit) ) / ln( (T_wall - T_in)/(T_wall - T_exit) )

Wait, that's the log mean temperature difference formula. So,

Q = U A * (ΔT_lm)

Where ΔT_lm is the log mean temperature difference.

So, m c_p (T_exit - 60) = U A * ( (80-60) - (80 - T_exit) ) / ln( (80-60)/(80 - T_exit) )

Simplify numerator inside the log: 20 - (80 - T_exit) = T_exit -60.

So,

m c_p (T_exit -60) = U A * (T_exit -60) / ln( (20)/(80 - T_exit) )

Wait, if I cancel (T_exit -60) from both sides, assuming T_exit !=60 (which it isn't), I get:

m c_p = U A / ln(20/(80 - T_exit)).

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me rewrite.

The left side is m c_p (T_exit -60).

The right side is U A * [ ( (T_wall - T_in) - (T_wall - T_exit) ) / ln( (T_wall - T_in)/(T_wall - T_exit) ) ) ]

Which is U A * ( (T_exit -60) ) / ln( (20)/(80 - T_exit) ) )

So,

m c_p (T_exit -60) = U A (T_exit -60) / ln(20/(80 - T_exit)) )

So, (T_exit -60) cancels out from both sides (assuming T_exit >60, which it is), so:

m c_p = U A / ln(20/(80 - T_exit)).

Let me rearrange this:

ln(20/(80 - T_exit)) = U A / (m c_p )

So,

ln(20/(80 - T_exit)) = (U A) / (m c_p )

Which is the same as:

ln( (80 - T_exit)/20 ) = - (U A)/(m c_p )

So,

(80 - T_exit)/20 = exp( - (U A)/(m c_p ) )

Therefore,

80 - T_exit = 20 * exp( - (U A)/(m c_p ) )

T_exit =
