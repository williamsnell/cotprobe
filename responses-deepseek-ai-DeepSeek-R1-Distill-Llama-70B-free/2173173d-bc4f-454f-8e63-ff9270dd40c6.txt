Okay, so I need to figure out this IFRS question. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a company's first IFRS reporting period, which is the year ended December 31, year 2. They’re preparing their year 2 financial statements and found an error where a $90,000 loss accrual wasn't recorded. Part of this loss, $40,000, relates to a year 1 event, and $50,000 to a year 2 event.

The question is asking what amount should be reported in the December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position. The options are A through J, with various amounts.

Hmm, I remember that when a company adopts IFRS for the first time, they have to present comparative information. So their first IFRS financial statements should include the current year (year 2) and the previous year (year 1). That means any adjustments from adopting IFRS would affect the opening balance for year 1.

Wait, but the error they found is in the year 2 preparation. They didn't accrue a loss that should have been recorded. Since part of the loss is from year 1, how does that affect the year 1 financials?

I think that under IFRS, when a prior period error is discovered, it should be corrected by restating the prior period's financial statements. So if the loss should have been accrued in year 1, then the year 1 financial statements need to reflect that.

The total loss is $90,000 split into $40k (year 1) and $50k (year 2). But since the company is now preparing their first IFRS statements (year 2), they have to present year 1 as well. So any errors in year 1 that affect the financials must be corrected.

Wait, in the year 2 statement of financial position, they found the error. So the error affects both years. For the December 31, year 1, statement, the $40k loss from year 1 should have been accrued then. But it wasn't, so they need to adjust it now.

So the year 1 financial position should include that loss. Therefore, in the year 1 statement of financial position, the loss of $40k would be accrued. 

But wait, the company didn't record any of the $90k loss. So in their initial year 2 statements, they only have the $50k for year 2, but not the $40k. But since the error is a prior period error, they need to adjust the opening balance of year 1.

So in the year 1 statement of financial position, the loss of $40k should be recognized. That would mean the liability is $40k as of Dec 31, year 1.

Looking at the options, option I is $40,000. So that's probably the correct answer.

The company’s first IFRS reporting period is for the year ended December 31, year 2. While preparing the year 2 financial statements, management discovered an error where a $90,000 loss accrual was not recorded. Of this amount, $40,000 relates to a year 1 event, and $50,000 relates to a year 2 event. 

Under IFRS, when a company adopts IFRS for the first time, it must present comparative information, including the prior year’s financial statements. Any errors related to the prior year must be corrected by restating the prior period’s financial statements. Therefore, the $40,000 loss that should have been accrued in year 1 must be reflected in the December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position. 

Thus, the amount of loss accrual that should be reported in the December 31, year 1, IFRS statement of financial position is $40,000.

I: $40,000

Answer: I
