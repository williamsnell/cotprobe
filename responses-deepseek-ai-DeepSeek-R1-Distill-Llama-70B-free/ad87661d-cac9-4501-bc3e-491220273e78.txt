Okay, so I've got this problem about the spread of an epidemic, and I'm trying to figure it out. The problem says that the rate of spread is jointly proportional to the number of infected and uninfected people. Hmm, I remember that joint proportionality means it's like a product of the two. So, the rate is proportional to I times U, where I is infected and U is uninfected.

The town has 5000 people. Initially, 160 are infected, so uninfected would be 5000 - 160 = 4840. By the end of the week, 1200 are infected. So, that's an increase of 1200-160 = 1040 people in one week. Wait, but the question is asking about how long until 80% of the population is infected. 80% of 5000 is 4000. So we want to find the time it takes to go from 160 to 4000 infected.

I think this model is similar to the logistic growth model, but maybe the setup is a bit different. Let me recall the differential equation. Since the rate is proportional to I * U, that would be dI/dt = k * I * (N - I), where N is the total population. N is 5000 here.

This differential equation is a logistic equation, but wait, the standard logistic equation is dI/dt = k I (N - I), which is what we have. So the solution to this is the logistic growth function. The general solution for I(t) is I(t) = N / (1 + (N - I0)/I0 * e^(-k N t)) ), where I0 is the initial number of infected.

But wait, I might have gotten that formula wrong. Let me think again. The solution should be I(t) = (N I0) / (I0 + (N - I0)e^{-rt} ), where r is the growth rate. Hmm, maybe another way to write it. Alternatively, using the method of integrating the differential equation.

Let me try to integrate dI/dt = k I (N - I). So, separating variables, we get dI / [I (N - I)] = k dt.

We can integrate both sides. The integral of dI / [I (N - I)] is (1/N) ln(I/(N-I)) ) + C, because using partial fractions: 1/(I(N-I)) = [1/N][1/(N-I) + 1/I] ? Wait, no. Wait, partial fractions for 1/(I (N-I)) would be A/I + B/(N-I). Let me compute that.

So, 1/(I (N-I)) ) = A/(I) + B/(N-I). Multiplying both sides by I(N-I),

1 = A (N-I) + B I.

Setting I=0: 1 = A N => A = 1/N.

Setting I=N: 1 = B N => B = 1/N.

So, 1/(I(N-I)) ) = (1/N)(1/I + 1/(N-I)) ). Wait, no, because when I set up A and B, I get A = 1/N and B = 1/N. Wait, so integrating 1/(I(N-I)) dI is (1/N) [ ln(I) - ln(N-I) ) ] + C. Because the integral of 1/I is ln I, and integral of 1/(N-I) is -ln(N-I). So the integral becomes (1/N) ln( I/(N-I) )) + C.

So, integrating both sides of dI/dt = k I (N-I):

∫ [1/(I (N-I))] dI = ∫ k dt.

Which gives (1/N) ln(I/(N-I)) ) = kt + C.

At t=0, I = I0 = 160: so,

(1/N) ln(I0/(N-I0)) ) = C.

Thus, the equation becomes:

(1/N) ln(I/(N-I)) ) = kt + (1/N) ln(I0/(N-I0)).

Multiply both sides by N:

ln(I/(N-I)) = N k t + ln(I0/(N-I0)).

Exponentiating both sides:

I/(N-I) = e^{Nkt} * (I0/(N-I0)).

So,

I(t) = (N I0 e^{Nkt}) ) / ( I0 + (N - I0) e^{Nkt} ) )

Wait, maybe it's easier to solve for t when I is 4000. Let's plug I=4000 into the equation.

So,

4000/(5000 - 4000) = (160/(5000 - 160)) e^{5000 k t}.

Simplify:

4000/1000 = (160/4840) e^{5000kt}.

So 4 = (160/4840) e^{5000kt}.

Multiply both sides by 4840/160:

4 * (4840/160) = e^{5000kt}.

Compute 4*(4840/160). Let's see: 4840 /160 is 30.25, because 160 * 30 = 4800, 4840-4800=40, so 40/160=0.25, so 30.25. Then 4 *30.25=121.

So 121 = e^{5000kt}.

Take natural log of both sides:

ln(121) = 5000 k t.

So t = (ln(121))/(5000 k).

Now, I need to find k. To find k, use the initial data: at t=0, I=160; at t=1 week, I=1200.

Let me use the same equation to set up for t=1 week:

I(1) = 1200 = (5000 * 160 e^{5000 k *1}) ) / (160 + (5000 - 160) e^{5000 k *1} )

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me denote e^{5000 k} as x for simplicity.

So,

1200 = (5000 * 160 x ) / (160 + 4840 x )

Multiply both sides by denominator:

1200 (160 + 4840 x ) = 5000 *160 x.

Expand left side:

1200*160 + 1200*4840 x = 800000 x.

Compute:

1200*160 = 192000.

1200*4840 = 5,808,000.

So,

192000 + 5,808,000 x = 800,000 x.

Subtract 800,000 x from both sides:

192000 + (5,808,000 - 800,000) x = 0.

5,808,000 -800,000 = 5,008,000.

So,

192000 + 5,008,000 x = 0.

Hmm, wait, that can't be right because 5,008,000 x would be positive, but 192000 is positive, so their sum can't be zero. I must have made a mistake in setup.

Wait, let me check the substitution again. So I set x = e^{5000 k *1} = e^{5000k}.

The equation is:

1200 = [5000 *160 x ] / [160 + 4840 x ]

Multiply both sides by denominator:

1200 (160 + 4840 x ) = 5000 *160 x.

Compute left side: 1200*160 = 192000; 1200*4840 x = 5,808,000 x.

Right side: 5000 *160 x = 800,000 x.

So,

192000 + 5,808,000 x = 800,000 x.

Bring terms together:

192000 = 800,000 x - 5,808,000 x.

Which is 192000 = (800,000 -5,808,000) x = (-5,008,000) x.

So,

x = 192000 / (-5,008,000) = approximately -0.0383. But x is e^{5000k}, which can't be negative. Hmm, that's impossible. So I must have messed up the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I inverted I and (N-I) in the setup. Let me go back. The equation after integrating was:

I/(N-I) = (I0/(N-I0)) e^{Nkt}.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra when solving for I(t). Let me rederive that.

We have:

ln(I/(N-I)) = Nkt + ln(I0/(N-I0)).

So,

I/(N-I) = e^{Nkt} * I0/(N-I0).

So,

I = [N I0 e^{Nkt} ] / [ (N-I0) e^{Nkt} + I0 ].

Wait, maybe I should check that again. Let's solve for I:

I/(N-I) = (I0)/(N-I0) e^{Nkt}.

Multiply both sides by (N-I):

I = (N-I) * (I0/(N-I0)) e^{Nkt}.

Then,

I = [N (I0 e^{Nkt}) / (N-I0) ] - [I (I0 e^{Nkt}) / (N-I0) ].

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, collect terms:

I + (I (I0 e^{Nkt}) )/(N-I0) ) = N (I0 e^{Nkt}) / (N-I0).

Factor I:

I [ 1 + (I0 e^{Nkt})/(N-I0) ) ] = N I0 e^{Nkt} / (N-I0).

Thus,

I = [ N I0 e^{Nkt} / (N-I0) ) ] / [ 1 + (I0 e^{Nkt})/(N-I0) ) ]

Multiply numerator and denominator by (N-I0):

I = [ N I0 e^{Nkt} ] / [ (N-I0) + I0 e^{Nkt} ) ]

Which is the same as before.

So, when I=1200, t=1 week.

So plug I=1200, N=5000, I0=160, t=1.

So,

1200 = [5000 *160 e^{5000k} ] / [ (5000 -160) +160 e^{5000k} ]

Simplify denominator: 5000-160=4840, so denominator is 4840 +160 e^{5000k}.

So,

1200 = (800000 e^{5000k}) / (4840 + 160 e^{5000k} )

Multiply both sides by denominator:

1200*(4840 +160 e^{5000k}) = 800000 e^{5000k}.

Expand left side:

1200*4840 + 1200*160 e^{5000k} = 800000 e^{5000k}.

Compute 1200*4840: Let's see, 1200*4000=4,800,000, 1200*840=1,008,000; so total 5,808,000.

1200*160=192,000.

So,

5,808,000 +192,000 e^{5000k} = 800,000 e^{5000k}.

Bring terms together:

5,808,000 = (800,000 -192,000) e^{5000k}.

Which is 608,000 e^{5000k}.

So,

e^{5000k} = 5,808,000 / 608,000.

Compute that: 5,808,000 ÷ 608,000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 5808 / 608.

5808 ÷ 608 = 9.555... Because 608 *9 =5472, 608*9.5=5776, 608*9.55=608*(9 +0.5 +0.05)=5472 + 304 +30.4=5806.4. Close. So approximately 9.555.

So e^{5000k} ≈9.555.

Take natural log: 5000k = ln(9.555).

Compute ln(9.555): ln(9)=2.197, ln(10)=2.302. 9.555 is about 9.555-9=0.555 above 9. Let me compute ln(9.555):

We can approximate it. Let me compute it more accurately. Let me see, e^2.25 is about 9.4877 (since e^2=7.389; e^0.25≈1.284; 7.389 *1.284≈9.487). So e^2.25≈9.4877.

But 9.555 is a bit higher. So 2.25 + delta. Let delta be such that e^{2.25 + delta} =9.555.

We have e^{2.25} ≈9.4877, so 9.555/9.4877 =1.007.

So, e^{delta}=1.007. delta≈0.007.

So, ln(9.555)=2.25 +0.007≈2.257.

Thus, 5000k=2.257. So k=2.257/(5000)≈0.0004514 per day.

Wait, but let me be precise. Using a calculator, ln(9.555)=?

Let me compute it accurately:

We know that ln(9)=2.1972245773,

ln(10)=2.302585093.

Compute ln(9.555):

Let me compute 9.555=9*(1+0.061666...).

So, ln(9.555)=ln(9*(1+0.061666))= ln(9) + ln(1.061666).

ln(1.061666)≈0.05978 (since ln(1+x)≈x -x^2/2 +x^3/3... for small x. So x=0.061666.

x≈0.061666, x^2≈0.0038, x^3≈0.00024.

So ln(1+x)≈0.061666 - 0.0038/2 + 0.00024/3.

≈0.061666 -0.0019 +0.00008 ≈0.059846.

So ln(9.555)=2.1972246 +0.059846≈2.25707.

So 5000k=2.25707 → k=2.25707/(5000)=0.00045141 per day.

Now, back to the original problem: we need to find the time t when I(t)=4000.

Using the equation I(t) = N I0 e^{Nkt} / [ (N-I0) + I0 e^{Nkt} ].

Wait, let me rearrange it. Alternatively, using the expression I(t)/(N-I(t)) = (I0/(N-I0)) e^{Nkt}.

So plugging I(t)=4000:

4000/(5000-4000) = (160/(5000-160)) e^{5000 k t}.

So,

4000/1000 = (160/4840) e^{5000 k t}.

Simplify:

4 = (160/4840) e^{5000kt}.

Multiply both sides by (4840/160):

4*(4840/160) = e^{5000kt}.

Compute 4*(4840/160):

4840/160 =30.25, because 160*30=4800, 4840-4800=40, 40/160=0.25 → 30.25.

4*30.25=121.

So,

e^{5000kt}=121.

Take natural log:

5000kt= ln(121)= approximately 4.7958 (since ln(120)=4.7875, ln(121)=4.7958).

So t= (4.7958)/(5000k).

We have k=0.00045141 per day.

So,

t=4.7958/(5000 *0.00045141) → let me compute denominator: 5000 *0.00045141=2.25705.

So t=4.7958/2.25705≈2.12 days.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the range of 8-35 days. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me retrace the steps.

Wait, the initial setup: the time when I=1200 is t=1 week, which is 7 days. Oh wait! In my earlier calculation, I used t=1, but perhaps it's t=7 days. That would make a big difference.

Ah! That's the mistake. Because when I set up the equation for I(1), I assumed t=1 day, but in reality, the data is given for t=1 week. So when I calculated k, I used t=1 week as t=1, but perhaps in the problem, the time is in days. So perhaps I should have used t=7 days when I=1200.

Wait, the question says, "at the beginning of the week and 1200 have it at the end of the week." So the time between initial and final is 7 days.

So, when I set up the equation with I=1200, t=7 days.

Let me redo that part.

So, for t=7 days:

e^{5000k*7} =5,808,000 /608,000=9.555 as before.

So,

5000k *7=ln(9.555)=2.25707.

So,

k=2.25707/(5000 *7)=2.25707/(35,000)≈0.00006444 per day.

Wait, wait, 5000k *7 =2.25707 → k=2.25707/(5000*7)=2.25707/(35,000)=approx 0.00006444.

So now, when finding t for I=4000:

5000k t=ln(121).

So,

t= ln(121)/(5000k).

We have ln(121)=4.7958.

So,

t=4.7958/(5000 *0.00006444) → 5000 *0.00006444=0.3222.

So t=4.7958/0.3222≈14.88 days.

Looking at the options, the closest is 15 days, which is option I.

Wait, but let me recalculate more accurately.

Compute
