Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this Socrates question. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about what Socrates believed regarding the value of life and virtue. 

The question states that according to Socrates, the quality of one's life depends on understanding the principles of human existence. Without that knowledge, life lacks virtue. So the question is asking why that is the case.

I remember that Socrates is all about the examined life. He famously said, "The unexamined life is not worth living." So he really emphasized self-reflection and understanding. But how does that tie into virtue?

Virtue, in philosophical terms, especially for Socrates, is often linked to knowledge. I think Socrates believed that virtue is knowledge. So if you don't have knowledge or understanding, you can't act virtuously. 

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Understanding existence philosophically leads to personal satisfaction. Hmm, personal satisfaction might be a byproduct, but I don't think that's the main reason Socrates connects understanding with virtue. He's more about the moral aspect rather than just feeling satisfied.

Option B: Life lacks virtue if one doesn't contribute to society. I'm not sure Socrates focused on societal contribution as much as on individual knowledge and wisdom. It seems more like a utilitarian view maybe, but not directly Socratic.

Option C: Ignorance is a virtue leading to humility. Wait, no. Socrates actually criticized ignorance. He believed in pursuing knowledge, so this doesn't fit.

Option D: Philosophical understanding isn't necessary if one is happy. That's the opposite of what Socrates thought. He'd probably say that without understanding, even if you're happy, your life lacks virtue.

Option E: Acting virtuously means acting informed about what you're doing and why. This sounds familiar. If you act without understanding, you can't be virtuous. So virtue requires informed action, which comes from knowledge.

Option F: Virtue is irrelevant to quality of life. No, Socrates definitely thought virtue was crucial, so this is incorrect.

Option G: Someone without philosophical understanding could never do anything right. That seems too extreme. Socrates might say they can't act virtuously, but maybe they can do some things right in other senses.

Option H: Virtue is knowledge and the unexamined life isn't worth living. This combines two Socratic ideas. But wait, the question is about why life lacks virtue without knowledge. This option includes both the knowledge aspect and the unexamined life quote, which is accurate but maybe not the direct reason tied to virtue.

Option I: Value is determined by wealth and status. No, Socrates was against materialism and focused on the soul and wisdom.

Option J: To have the power to do anything requires knowing what you're doing. This seems more about effectiveness rather than virtue. It's a bit different from the moral aspect.

So, narrowing it down. The key point is that without understanding (knowledge), one can't act virtuously. So E says that acting virtuously requires being informed about what you're doing and why. That aligns with Socrates' belief that virtue is knowledge. Without that knowledge, you can't act virtuously, hence life lacks virtue.

Option H also mentions virtue as knowledge, which is correct, but the second part is about the unexamined life, which is a related but slightly different point. The question is specifically about why life lacks virtue without understanding. So E directly addresses the reason: because you can't act virtuously without informed action.
</think>

The question asks why, according to Socrates, life lacks virtue without understanding the principles of human existence. Socrates emphasized that virtue is closely tied to knowledge and that acting virtuously requires informed action. Among the options, **E** best captures this idea by stating that acting virtuously means acting in a way that is informed about what one is doing and why. This aligns with Socrates' belief that without knowledge, one cannot act virtuously, making life lacking in virtue.

Answer: E
