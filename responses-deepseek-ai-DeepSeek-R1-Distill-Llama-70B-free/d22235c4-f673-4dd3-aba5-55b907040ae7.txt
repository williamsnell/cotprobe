Question:

How does metamorphosis differ from molting? What animals other than arthropods are known to undergo metamorphosis in their development?

Options:

A: Metamorphosis only occurs in insects, while molting occurs in all animals including mammals and birds.
B: Metamorphosis involves the development of gills in aquatic animals, and molting is the development of lungs in terrestrial animals. Mollusks undergo metamorphosis.
C: Only arthropods undergo metamorphosis
D: Molting and metamorphosis are the same process
E: Molting is a change in coloration of the animal, while metamorphosis involves the shedding of skin. Fish are known to undergo metamorphosis.
F: Molting involves a change from the juvenile to the adult form, unlike metamorphosis which is shedding of the exoskeleton to allow growth
G: Molting is the process of transitioning from water to land habitats, whereas metamorphosis is the process of changing from carnivorous to herbivorous diets. Echinoderms undergo metamorphosis.
H: Metamorphosis is the process where animals grow additional legs, whereas molting is for growing wings. Reptiles also undergo metamorphosis.
I: Metamorphosis involves a change from the juvenile to the adult form, unlike molting which is shedding of the exoskeleton to allow growth. Amphibians like frogs and aquatic animals like sea stars also undergo metamorphosis
J: Metamorphosis is the process of internal organ development, and molting is the growth of new appendages. Certain species of annelids undergo metamorphosis.

Okay, so I have this question about metamorphosis and molting, and I need to figure out the right answer. Hmm, I remember that both processes are related to growth in animals, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let's break it down.

First, the question asks how metamorphosis differs from molting. I think molting is when an animal sheds its skin or exoskeleton to grow. Like, I remember that insects and crustaceans molt because their exoskeletons don't grow, so they shed them periodically. It's a process where the animal outgrows its outer layer and replaces it.

Metamorphosis, on the other hand, is a more dramatic change. Like, I think of frogs. A frog starts as an egg, hatches into a tadpole, and then undergoes metamorphosis to become a frog. So that's a major transformation, not just shedding skin. It involves changes in form, like organs and body structure.

So, the difference is that molting is about shedding the exoskeleton for growth, while metamorphosis is a developmental process that changes the body form from juvenile to adult stages.

The second part of the question asks which animals other than arthropods undergo metamorphosis. Well, arthropods do molt, but do they undergo metamorphosis? Wait, some arthropods, like insects, undergo metamorphosis. For example, holometabolism in insects includes stages like egg, larva, pupa, and adult. So that's metamorphosis. But the question is about animals other than arthropods that undergo metamorphosis.

I know that amphibians, like frogs and toads, undergo metamorphosis. They go from tadpoles to adults. Also, some marine animals like sea stars (starfish) have larvae that metamorphose into adults. I think some mollusks and echinoderms also undergo metamorphosis, where they have a larval stage that changes into the adult form.

Looking at the options now:

Option I says: Metamorphosis involves a change from juvenile to adult form, unlike molting which is shedding exoskeleton. Also, amphibians like frogs and sea stars undergo metamorphosis. That seems right because it correctly differentiates the two processes and identifies other animals.

Let me check other options briefly. Option B talks about gills and lungs, which doesn't seem right. Option J mentions annelids, but I'm not sure if they're the main ones known for metamorphosis. Option I fits what I remember about frogs and sea stars.

The correct answer is:

I: Metamorphosis involves a change from the juvenile to the adult form, unlike molting which is shedding of the exoskeleton to allow growth. Amphibians like frogs and aquatic animals like sea stars also undergo metamorphosis.

Answer: I
