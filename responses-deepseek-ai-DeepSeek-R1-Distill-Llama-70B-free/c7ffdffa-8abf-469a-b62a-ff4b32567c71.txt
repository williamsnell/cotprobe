Okay, so I've got this gas problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The problem says that there's a collapsed polyethylene bag with a 30-liter capacity. Initially, it's collapsed, so I guess it's not holding any volume. Then, someone adds 10 liters of nitrogen gas measured at 0.965 atm and 298 K. After that, they pump in enough oxygen so that the bag fills up to 30 liters at 298 K and an external pressure of 0.990 atm. The question is about the final partial pressure of oxygen.

Hmm, I remember something about the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. Partial pressures come into play when you have a mixture of gases. Oh right, Dalton's Law says that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas.

Wait, so the bag initially is collapsed. When they add 10 L of N2, but wait, is that 10 liters at standard conditions or at some specific conditions? Oh, the problem says it's measured at 0.965 atm and 298 K. So, that's the initial state of the nitrogen.

Then, after adding oxygen, the total volume becomes 30 liters at 298 K and 0.990 atm. So the total pressure is 0.990 atm, but that's the sum of the partial pressures of nitrogen and oxygen.

Wait, but when they add the oxygen, does the nitrogen expand into the larger volume? Because the bag was initially collapsed, so when they add N2, the volume is 10 liters under those conditions. But when they add O2, the total volume becomes 30 liters. So the N2 is expanding from 10 L to 30 L? Or wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, the initial state is a collapsed bag, so when they add 10 L of N2 at 0.965 atm and 298 K, that's the initial volume. Then, when they add O2, the total volume becomes 30 L, with the total pressure being 0.990 atm at the same temperature.

So the N2 is expanding from 10 L to 30 L. So, for the N2, the pressure will change. Because the temperature is constant, I can use Boyle's Law for the N2. Because temperature is the same before and after, so P1V1 = P2V2.

Let me write that down.

Initial state of N2: P1 = 0.965 atm, V1 = 10 L, T same. After adding O2, V2 = 30 L, so P2 is the partial pressure of N2 in the final mixture.

So P2 = (P1 * V1) / V2 = (0.965 atm * 10 L) / 30 L = 0.965 / 3 = approximately 0.3217 atm.

So the partial pressure of N2 is about 0.3217 atm.

Now, the total pressure in the bag is 0.990 atm. So the partial pressure of O2 is the total pressure minus the partial pressure of N2.

So PO2 = P_total - PN2 = 0.990 atm - 0.3217 atm = 0.6683 atm.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.669 atm, which is close to what I got. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, the initial N2 is 10 liters at 0.965 atm and 298 K. Then, the total volume is 30 liters at 0.990 atm and same T. So using PV = nRT, since T is same, n is same for N2 before and after.

Wait, maybe I should approach it using the ideal gas law for N2.

For the initial N2:

n = (P1 V1) / (RT) = (0.965 atm * 10 L) / (R T)

After expansion, the N2 is at P2 (partial pressure), V_total =30 L, same T.

n = (P2 * 30 L) / (R T)

Since n is same, equate the two:

(0.965 *10)/(R T) = (P2 *30)/(R T)

Cancel RT from both sides:

0.965 *10 = P2 *30 → P2 = (0.965 *10)/30 = 0.965/3 ≈0.3217 atm.

So that's correct.

Total pressure is sum of partial pressures: P_total = PN2 + PO2.

So PO2 = 0.990 - 0.3217 = 0.6683 atm. So 0.6683 is approximately 0.669 atm, which is option F.

Wait, but let me check all the steps again.

Wait, the initial N2 is 10 L at 0.965 atm, but when O2 is added, the total volume becomes 30 L. So the N2 expands into the larger volume, so its pressure decreases. The partial pressure of N2 is 0.3217 atm, as calculated. Then O2's partial pressure is 0.990 minus that, giving 0.6683. So option F is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of moles. The moles of N2 initially are (0.965 *10)/(R*298). After expansion, the same moles are present in 30 L at 0.3217 atm. So the partial pressure comes out the same.

So the answer should be F: 0.669 atm.

To determine the final partial pressure of oxygen in the experiment, we analyze the situation using the ideal gas law and Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures. The polyethylene bag initially contains 10 liters of nitrogen gas at 0.965 atm and 298 K. When oxygen is added, the total volume expands to 30 liters at 298 K and a total pressure of 0.990 atm. The goal is to calculate the partial pressure of oxygen in the final mixture.

### Step 1: Calculate the partial pressure of nitrogen in the final mixture
The nitrogen gas expands from an initial volume of 10 liters to a final volume of 30 liters at constant temperature. Using Boyle's Law (\(P_1V_1 = P_2V_2\)), the partial pressure of nitrogen in the final mixture is:

\[
P_{\text{N}_2} = \frac{P_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.965 \, \text{atm} \times 10 \, \text{L}}{30 \, \text{L}} = 0.3217 \, \text{atm}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the partial pressure of oxygen
The total pressure in the final mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of nitrogen and oxygen (\(P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{N}_2} + P_{\text{O}_2}\)). Rearranging for \(P_{\text{O}_2}\):

\[
P_{\text{O}_2} = P_{\text{total}} - P_{\text{N}_2} = 0.990 \, \text{atm} - 0.3217 \, \text{atm} = 0.6683 \, \text{atm}.
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated partial pressure of oxygen (\(P_{\text{O}_2} \approx 0.6683 \, \text{atm}\)) is closest to option **F: 0.669 atm**.

### Final Answer:
F: 0.669 atm

The final answer is **F**.
