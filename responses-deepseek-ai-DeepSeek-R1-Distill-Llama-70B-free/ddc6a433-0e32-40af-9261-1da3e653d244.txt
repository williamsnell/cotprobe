Okay, so I need to figure out which statement about the "reasonable person" standard in tort law is correct. Hmm, I remember that the reasonable person standard is a legal concept used to determine whether someone acted with negligence. Let me think through each option.

Option A says it applies only to people with high education. That doesn't sound right. I think the standard is more about general reasonableness, not education level. So probably not A.

Option B claims it applies only to people without disabilities. Wait, I'm pretty sure the law makes accommodations for disabilities. So for someone with a physical disability, the standard would consider a reasonable person with that disability, not ignoring it. So B might be incorrect because it excludes people with disabilities, which doesn't fit.

Option C states the standard varies from person to person. No, I think the standard is more objective. It's about a hypothetical reasonable person, not varying based on each individual's circumstances. So C is likely wrong.

Option D says the standard requires acting as the average person in the community. Hmm, I thought the reasonable person isn't the average but rather a prudent and cautious person. So maybe D is incorrect because it's about the average, which isn't the same as the reasonable person.

Option E: A person with a mental disability must act as someone with the same disability. Wait, I think for physical disabilities, the law adjusts the standard, like considering a reasonable person with that disability. But for mental disabilities, it's sometimes different. If someone has a mental impairment, they might be held to the standard of a reasonable person without the impairment, unless it's a cognitive issue. So E might be incorrect because it could vary.

Option F: A person with a physical disability must act as a reasonable person with the same disability. Yes, this rings a bell. The standard adjusts for physical disabilities, so the defendant is compared to a reasonable person who has the same physical limitations. So F seems correct.

Option G says it focuses on the defendant's subjective mental state. No, the reasonable person is an objective standard. It's about how a reasonable person would act, not what the defendant was thinking. So G is wrong.

Option H claims it's based solely on the defendant's age. No, age can be a factor in some cases, but the standard isn't solely based on age. So H is incorrect.

Option I: A person with a mental disability isn't subject to the standard. No, I think they are, but the standard might adjust based on whether the disability affects their ability to understand and act reasonably. So I is probably wrong.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be F. Because the reasonable person standard for someone with a physical disability is adjusted to consider a reasonable person with that same disability. So F is correct.

The correct answer is:

F: A person with a physical disability must act as would a reasonable person with the same disability.

This is because the reasonable person standard adjusts for physical disabilities, meaning the defendant is held to the standard of a reasonable person who shares the same physical limitations. 

Answer: F
