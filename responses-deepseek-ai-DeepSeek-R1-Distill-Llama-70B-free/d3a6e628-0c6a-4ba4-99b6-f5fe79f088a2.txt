Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a comet impacting Earth. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the total energy released when a comet of mass m impacts Earth at the minimum speed. The Earth's mass is M and radius R. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the right expression.

Wait, what's the minimum impact speed? I remember that for an object to just barely hit a planet, it's moving at the escape velocity. Oh wait, no. Wait, escape velocity is the speed needed to break free from the planet's gravity without further propulsion. But when something is falling into a planet, like a comet, the minimum speed would be when it's just barely captured by the planet's gravity. Or wait, maybe the minimum speed is when the object is just at the Earth's surface, having fallen from a very large distance, so it's moving at the escape velocity, but that's the maximum speed, isn't it? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let me think again. The minimum impact speed would be when the comet is moving at the lowest possible speed that still allows it to impact the Earth. That's when all of its kinetic energy is just enough to overcome the gravitational potential energy from a very large distance. Because if it's moving any slower, it wouldn't reach the Earth; it would just orbit or something.

So, the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) at infinity is zero, I think. Because gravitational potential energy approaches zero as you go to infinity. So, when the comet is at a very large distance, its kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², and the potential energy is about -G M m / (2r), where r is the distance. But as r approaches infinity, the potential energy approaches zero.

Wait, no. Actually, the potential energy U is -G M m / r. At infinity, U is zero. So the total energy is just the kinetic energy there. When it impacts Earth, it's moving at speed v such that all that energy is converted. But the minimum speed would be when it just reaches the surface, right? So all the kinetic energy is converted into gravitational potential energy as it moves from infinity to the Earth's surface.

Wait, but the kinetic energy is initially (1/2)mv², and when it reaches Earth's surface, that energy is converted into gravitational potential energy. So, (1/2)mv² = G M m / R. Solving for v, we get v = sqrt(2 G M / R). Oh, but wait, that's the escape velocity, v_esc = sqrt(2 G M / R). So that's the speed you need to escape Earth's gravity from the surface. But wait, in this problem, the comet is impacting Earth at the minimum speed. So perhaps that's the minimum speed because any lower and it wouldn't reach. So the minimum speed is sqrt(2 G M / R). Hmm.

Wait, but when an object falls from infinity, the speed at the surface is sqrt(2 G M / R). So the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v² = (1/2) m (2 G M / R) )= G M m / R.

So the total energy released would be the kinetic energy the comet has when it hits the Earth. Because that's when all the potential energy has been converted into kinetic. So the energy released is GMm/R.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me check the options again.

Option A: 0.5*m*(2GM/R) → which simplifies to (GMm)/R. That's what I thought.

Option E is 0.5*m*(3GM/R), which would be (3/2) GMm/R. Hmm, that's more than the kinetic energy I calculated.

Wait, but what if the question is about the total energy released, including perhaps the Earth's energy? Or maybe it's just the kinetic energy of the comet upon impact. Because when the comet hits, the kinetic energy is converted into heat and other forms, so the energy released is that kinetic energy.

So, if the minimum speed is v = sqrt(2GM/R), then (1/2)mv² is GMm/R, so the energy released would be (1/2)*m*(2GM/R) )= GMm/R.

Looking back at the options, option A is 0.5*m*(2GM/R) → which is exactly GMm/R. So that's the same as my calculation.

So the correct answer should be option A.

To determine the total energy released when a comet of mass \( m \) impacts Earth at the minimum speed, we analyze the situation as follows:

The minimum impact speed corresponds to the comet falling from a very large distance (effectively infinity) to Earth's surface. At infinity, the total mechanical energy of the comet is purely kinetic, given by \( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \). As the comet approaches Earth, this kinetic energy is converted into gravitational potential energy, \( U = -\frac{GMm}{r} \), where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is Earth's mass, and \( r \) is the distance from Earth's center.

At Earth's surface (\( r = R \)), the comet's speed is determined by energy conservation. The total energy at infinity is zero (kinetic energy is the only term, and it is canceled by the potential energy at infinity, which is also zero). At the surface, the kinetic energy is entirely converted into gravitational potential energy, so:

\[
\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{GMm}{R}.
\]

Solving for \( v \), the speed at impact is:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}.
\]

The total energy released in the impact is the kinetic energy of the comet just before impact, which is:

\[
E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}m \left( \frac{2GM}{R} \right) = \frac{GMm}{R}.
\]

Examining the options, this matches option **A**, which is \( 0.5m(2GM/R) \), simplifying to \( \frac{GMm}{R} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A**
