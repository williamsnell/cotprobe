Okay, so I have this history question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about which group was converted to Christianity in the tenth century AD by missionaries from the Byzantine Empire. The options are A through J, each representing a different group.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about the spread of Christianity during that time. I remember that the Byzantine Empire, which was the Eastern Roman Empire, was a major center of Christianity, especially Orthodox Christianity. They sent missionaries to various regions to convert people.

The tenth century AD is the 900s. I know that during this time, several groups were being converted. For example, I think the Vikings were being Christianized around then, but they're not one of the options here. Wait, the options include groups like the Ostrogoths, Visigoths, and others.

Wait, the Ostrogoths were a Germanic tribe. They were around during the late Roman Empire. I think they had interactions with the Byzantines, but were they converted in the 10th century? I'm not sure. The Ostrogoths were actually Arians, a branch of Christianity considered heretical by the mainstream church. So maybe they were already Christian but not Orthodox. So perhaps missionaries were trying to convert them to Orthodox Christianity, but I'm not certain if that was in the 10th century.

The Visigoths were another Germanic group. They settled in Spain and eventually became Christian, but I think their conversion was earlier, maybe in the 6th or 7th century. So that might not fit the 10th century timeframe.

Russiansâ€”oh, right! I remember that Russia was converted to Christianity from Byzantium. The traditional date is 988 AD when Vladimir the Great converted. That's in the late 10th century. So the Russians would fit here. Looking at the options, option B is Russians.

Wait, let me think about the other options to make sure. The Moors were Muslim and in Spain, so probably not converted by Byzantine missionaries. The Anglo-Saxons were already Christian, influenced more by the Roman Church, I think. The Celts had Christianity earlier, maybe from earlier missionaries. The Huns were earlier too, and they were more nomadic. The Vandals were another Germanic group, but they were also Arians, and I think their main activity was in the 5th and 6th centuries. The Normans were converted later, but I think they were Christian by the time they became prominent in the 11th century. The Franks were Christianized earlier, like in the 5th or 6th century under Clovis.

So putting it all together, the Russians in the tenth century AD, converted by Byzantine missionaries, makes sense. So the answer should be option B: Russians.

The group converted to Christianity in the tenth century AD by missionaries from the Byzantine Empire was the Russians. This conversion is traditionally dated to 988 AD under Vladimir the Great. Other options, such as the Ostrogoths and Visigoths, were already Christian (albeit as Arians) or were converted earlier. The Russians fit the timeframe and context of Byzantine missionary activity.

Answer: B
