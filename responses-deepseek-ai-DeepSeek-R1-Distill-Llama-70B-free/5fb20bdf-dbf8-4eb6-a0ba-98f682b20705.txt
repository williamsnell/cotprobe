Question:

During his political campaign, he refused to lie about a psychiatric problem in his past, and his honesty cost him the election. The man was quoted as saying, "If I lied, I'd be mayor today, but that's no way to win an election. "The BEST argument of the objector to such evidence in the tax fraud case would be which of the following?

Options:

A: The defendant's honesty during his political campaign has no bearing on his honesty in financial matters.
B: The evidence is biased as it is coming from the defendant himself.
C: The man's honesty in one situation doesn't necessarily apply to all situations.
D: Character evidence is not admissible in such cases.
E: One incident doesn't prove character.
F: The evidence could sway the jury's opinion unfairly.
G: This is an impermissible way to prove character.
H: The tax fraud case and the political campaign are two separate incidents.
I: The incident is too far in the past to be relevant.

Okay, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with character evidence in a tax fraud case. Let me try to break it down.

The situation is that a man is charged with tax fraud and wants to present evidence of his honesty during his mayoral campaign. During the campaign, he refused to lie about a psychiatric problem, which cost him the election. He’s quoted as saying that if he lied, he’d be mayor, but he didn’t because that's not how to win. Now, the question is about the best argument the objector would make against admitting this evidence.

The options are A to I, and I need to figure out which is the best one. 

First, I remember that evidence law generally doesn’t allow the use of specific instances of conduct to prove a person’s character. There's a rule against it, I think it's FRE 405 or something like that. Oh wait, FRE 405 says that in a civil case, you can't prove character by specific instances, except for in criminal cases where the defendant's character is an essential element, like in a case involving a trait of character. But wait, in criminal cases, the defendant can offer evidence of good character. But there are limitations.

So the defendant here is offering evidence of his honesty in another situation to show he's not guilty of tax fraud. But I think the general rule is that specific acts can't be used to prove character; instead, you have to use reputation or opinion testimony.

Wait, but there's an exception for the defendant offering evidence of his good character. So the defendant can present evidence of his good character, but it's usually in the form of reputation evidence, not specific instances. So if he's trying to bring in a specific instance, that might not be allowed unless it's part of a broader character evidence.

Wait, no, I think the rules say that when a defendant offers evidence of good character, the prosecutor can then rebut it with specific instances of bad conduct. But the defendant himself can’t just bring up specific acts to prove his good character. Because that would be using specific instances to prove character, which is generally not allowed except in certain cases.

So the objection here would probably be that the evidence is being presented through specific instances, which is impermissible. So looking at the options, which one aligns with that.

Option A says the honesty in the campaign doesn't relate to financial honesty. That's a possible objection, but maybe not the best. Because the argument could be that honesty in one area doesn't mean honesty in another, but that's more about the relevance of the evidence.

Option B says the evidence is biased because it's from the defendant. But I don't think that's the main issue. The issue isn't bias but the form of evidence—whether it's specific instances.

Option C states that honesty in one situation doesn’t apply to all. Again, similar to A, it's about the relevance but not the admissibility based on the method of proof.

Option D: Character evidence is not admissible in such cases. Wait, but in criminal cases, the defendant can present character evidence. So this might not be the best argument.

Option E: One incident doesn't prove character. That's true, but the objection would be on the method, not the sufficiency.

Option F: The evidence could sway the jury unfairly. That's a possible concern, but it's not the best legal argument here. The legal issue is more about the form of evidence.

Option G: This is an impermissible way to prove character. That sounds right because using specific instances is not allowed under FRE 405. So the objection would be that you can't use specific acts to prove character; you need reputation or opinion.

Option H: They're separate incidents. Again, this is more about relevance but not the admissibility.

Option I: Incident is too old. The question doesn't say when the campaign was, so probably not relevant here.

So putting it together, the best argument is that the evidence is an impermissible way to prove character because it uses specific instances rather than reputation or opinion. So the correct option would be G.
</think>

The best argument of the objector is that the evidence is being presented through specific instances of conduct, which is impermissible under the rules of evidence. Specifically, FRE 405 prohibits the use of specific acts to prove character; instead, character must be proven through reputation or opinion testimony. While the defendant may offer evidence of good character in a criminal case, the method here—using a specific incident from a political campaign—is not an allowable way to establish character. Therefore, the objection would focus on the impermissible form of evidence.
