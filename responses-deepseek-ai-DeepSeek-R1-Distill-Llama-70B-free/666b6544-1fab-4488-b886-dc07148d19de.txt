Question:

Three years ago, Fred invested $10,000 in the shares of ABC Corp. Each year, the company distributed dividends to its shareholders. Each year, Fred received $100 in dividends. Note that since Fred received $100 in dividends each year, his total income is $300. Today, Fred sold his shares for $12,000. What is the holding period return of his investment?

Options:

A: 0.28
B: 0.15
C: 0.18
D: 0.40
E: 0.25
F: 0.30
G: 0.33
H: 0.10
I: 0.23
J: 0.20

Okay, so I've got this question about holding period return, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let me read the question again.

Fred invested $10,000 in ABC Corp. shares three years ago. Each year, he got $100 in dividends, so that's three payments of $100 each. He sold the shares today for $12,000. I need to find the holding period return (HPR) of his investment.

Hmm, HPR, right. I remember that HPR is the total return over the holding period, including dividends and capital gains. The formula, if I recall correctly, is something like:

HPR = (Dividends + Capital Gain) / Initial Investment

Wait, but wait, I think it's actually the sum of all cash flows divided by the initial investment. Or is it the total return overall? Oh right, HPR is calculated as the sum of all dividends received plus the sale price minus the initial investment, all divided by the initial investment. Or maybe it's the total of all cash inflows divided by the initial investment.

Let me think. So the initial investment is $10,000. He received $100 each year for three years, so that's 3 * $100 = $300 in dividends. Then he sold the shares for $12,000, which is a gain because he sold for more than he bought. The capital gain is $12,000 - $10,000 = $2,000.

So the total gain is the sum of dividends plus the capital gain. So $300 + $2,000 = $2,300.

Wait, but HPR is the total return, which includes both the dividends and the capital appreciation. So HPR would be the total gain divided by the initial investment.

So HPR = ($300 + $2,000) / $10,000. Let me calculate that. $2,300 divided by $10,000 is 0.23. So the HPR is 0.23.

Wait, but wait, I'm a little confused. Another thought: HPR can also be calculated as the sum of each year's cash flow (dividend) plus the final sale price, all divided by the initial investment. Because the dividends are received each year, but the HPR is a measure of the overall return. So it's (Dividends received + proceeds from sale) minus initial investment, all divided by initial investment.

Alternatively, the formula might be: (Sale Price + Sum of Dividends - Purchase Price) / Purchase Price.

Wait, that makes sense. So it's (12,000 + 300 - 10,000) / 10,000. That would be (2,300) / 10,000 = 0.23.

So the HPR is 0.23. Looking at the options, option I is 0.23, so that's the answer.

But wait, I'm a bit unsure about whether I should be considering compounding or something. Because HPR is a measure over the period, but when it's not annualized, it's just the total return. So in this case, it's a three-year period, but since the question just asks for the holding period return, I think we're just calculating the total, not annualizing it. So the calculation is correct.

To calculate the holding period return (HPR) of Fred's investment, we consider all cash flows during the holding period, including dividends and the sale of the shares. The formula for HPR is:

\[
\text{HPR} = \frac{\text{Total Dividends} + \text{Sale Price} - \text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Initial Investment}}
\]

- **Initial Investment**: $10,000  
- **Total Dividends**: $100/year Ã— 3 years = $300  
- **Sale Price**: $12,000  
- **Capital Gain**: $12,000 - $10,000 = $2,000  

The total return is the sum of dividends and capital gain:  
\[
\text{Total Return} = $300 + $2,000 = $2,300
\]

Substituting into the HPR formula:  
\[
\text{HPR} = \frac{$2,300}{$10,000} = 0.23
\]

Thus, the holding period return is **0.23**, which corresponds to option **I**.
