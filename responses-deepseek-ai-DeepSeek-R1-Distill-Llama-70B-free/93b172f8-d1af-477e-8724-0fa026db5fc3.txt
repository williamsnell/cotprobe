Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out which formula correctly symbolizes the sentence: "Doctors are helpful unless their patients are rude." Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I should probably identify the propositions involved. So, let's say H stands for "Doctors are helpful," and R stands for "Their patients are rude." The sentence is connecting these two propositions with "unless," which I think implies some kind of conditional relationship.

Wait, I remember that "unless" can often be translated into a logical implication. Like, "A unless B" might mean "If B then not A" or something like that. Or maybe "A unless B" is the same as "If not B, then A." I'm a bit confused here. Let me think.

The original sentence is saying that doctors are helpful unless their patients are rude. So, if the patients are rude, then the doctors aren't helpful. So, it's like saying, if R (patients are rude), then ~H (doctors are not helpful). So that would be R → ~H. But I need to write this in terms of the options given, which are using H and R without necessarily using implications.

Alternatively, I could rewrite the implication. R → ~H is the same as ~R ∨ ~H by the equivalence of implication and disjunction. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original might be different.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The sentence is "Doctors are helpful unless their patients are rude." So, the default is that doctors are helpful, but if the patients are rude, then they aren't. So, it's like H is true unless R is true. So, H is true when R is false. So, H unless R is H or R? Or is it H and not R?

Wait, no. Because "unless" here is introducing an exception. So, H is true except when R is true. So, H is true if R is false. So, the statement is H when ~R. So, H is true if R is not true. So, that would be H ∧ ~R. Wait, no, because that would mean both H and R are false. No, wait, H is true when R is false. So, the formula should represent that H is true only when R is not true.

Wait, but in logic, "A unless B" is often represented as A ∨ B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's equivalent to "If B then not A," which is B → ~A. But in this case, A is H and B is R. So, R → ~H. Which is equivalent to ~R ∨ ~H. But that's not one of the options. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A: H ∨ R
B: ~H ∧ R
C: ~H ↔ R
D: H • R
E: H ∧ ~R
F: ~H ∨ R
G: H ↔ R
H: H → R
I: H ≡ R
J: H ∨ ~R

Wait, so I thought the original sentence translates to R → ~H, which is equivalent to ~R ∨ ~H. But none of the options directly have that. Alternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, another approach: The statement is "Doctors are helpful unless their patients are rude." So, the only time doctors are not helpful is when patients are rude. So, that can be phrased as "If patients are rude, then doctors are not helpful," which is R → ~H. But how to represent this in terms of the options.

Alternatively, the statement could be rephrased as "Doctors are helpful if their patients are not rude." So, that would be ~R → H. Which is equivalent to H ∨ R? No, because ~R → H is H ∨ R? Wait, no. Wait, ~R → H is equivalent to H ∨ ~R. Because in general, A → B is equivalent to ~A ∨ B. So, ~R → H would be R ∨ H. Hmm, but that doesn't seem to match.

Wait, let me clarify. Let's define the statement again: "Doctors are helpful unless their patients are rude." So, it's saying that being helpful (H) is the case except when R is true. So, H holds unless R holds. So, H is true when R is false. So, H is equivalent to ~R. So, H ↔ ~R. Which would be H ≡ ~R.

But looking at the options, I don't see H ↔ ~R. The options have H ↔ R (option G) and ~H ↔ R (option C). So, that's not directly an option. Alternatively, maybe I can express H ↔ ~R using other logical connectives.

Wait, H ↔ ~R is equivalent to ~(H ↔ R), right? No, not exactly. Wait, no. H ↔ ~R is not the same as ~(H ↔ R). Let me think differently.

Alternatively, maybe the original statement can be expressed as H is true unless R is true. So, H is true when R is false. So, H is equivalent to ~R. So, that would be H ≡ ~R. But none of the options have ~R. So, perhaps I need to find an equivalent expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement can be expressed as H unless R, which is H ∨ R. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Or maybe H is true when R is false, which would be H ∧ ~R. But that's option E. Wait, let me think about that.

If I say H ∧ ~R, that means Doctors are helpful and patients are not rude. But the original statement doesn't say that both must be true; it says that doctors are helpful unless patients are rude. So, it allows for situations where patients are rude and doctors aren't helpful. So, H is true when R is false, but when R is true, H is false. So, the statement is saying that H and R cannot both be true. So, that would be ~ (H ∧ R), but that's not one of the options either.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider the contrapositive. The statement "Doctors are helpful unless their patients are rude" can be phrased as "If patients are rude, then doctors are not helpful." So, R → ~H. Now, R → ~H is equivalent to ~R ∨ ~H. But none of the options have ~R ∨ ~H. So, perhaps I should look for an equivalent expression.

Wait, looking at the options, option F is ~H ∨ R. Which is the same as R ∨ ~H, which is equivalent to R → ~H. Wait, no. Because in general, A → B is equivalent to ~A ∨ B. So, R → ~H is equivalent to ~R ∨ ~H, which is different from ~H ∨ R. Wait, no, because ~R ∨ ~H is the same as ~H ∨ ~R, which is different from ~H ∨ R.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify:

R → ~H is equivalent to ~R ∨ ~H.

So, ~R ∨ ~H is the same as ~H ∨ ~R.

Looking at the options, F is ~H ∨ R. So that's different because it's R instead of ~R.

So, none of the options directly express ~R ∨ ~H. So, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the original statement can be represented as H is true unless R is true. So, H is true in all cases except when R is true. So, the only time H is false is when R is true. So, that would be H is equivalent to ~R. So, H ≡ ~R.

But the options don't have H ≡ ~R. They have H ≡ R (option G) and ~H ≡ R (option C). So, perhaps I can manipulate H ≡ ~R into another form.

H ≡ ~R is equivalent to ~(H ≡ R), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, H ≡ ~R is the same as ~H ≡ R. Because if H is equivalent to not R, then not H is equivalent to R. So, ~H ≡ R would be option C.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if H is equivalent to ~R, then ~H is equivalent to R. So, the correct formula would be ~H ≡ R, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. If ~H ≡ R, then whenever R is true, ~H is true (so H is false), and whenever R is false, ~H is false (so H is true). That matches the original statement: doctors are helpful unless patients are rude. So, when patients are rude (R), doctors aren't helpful (~H). When patients aren't rude (~R), doctors are helpful (H). So, yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, let's look at option F: ~H ∨ R. That would mean either doctors aren't helpful or patients are rude. Which seems a bit different. Because in the original statement, when patients are rude, doctors aren't helpful, but when patients aren't rude, doctors are helpful. So, in all cases, either H is true (when R is false) or ~H is true (when R is true). So, that would mean that H ∨ R is not necessarily true. Wait, no, because if H is true when R is false, then H ∨ R would always be true, which isn't necessarily the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to evaluate each option against the statement.

Option E: H ∧ ~R. That would mean doctors are helpful and patients are not rude. But the original statement allows for the possibility that patients are rude and doctors aren't helpful. So, E is too restrictive because it only covers the case where H is true and R is false, but the statement also allows for H being false when R is true.

Option F: ~H ∨ R. This is equivalent to R ∨ ~H, which is the same as H → R. Wait, no, because H → R is equivalent to ~H ∨ R. So, option F is H → R. But our original statement is R → ~H, which is different. So, F would mean that if doctors are helpful, then patients are rude, which is the opposite of what we want.

Option C: ~H ↔ R. This means that ~H and R are equivalent, so whenever R is true, ~H is true, and vice versa. That seems to match the original statement because when patients are rude (R), doctors aren't helpful (~H), and when doctors aren't helpful (~H), patients are rude (R). So, this seems to fit.

Wait, but let me think about the contrapositive again. The original statement implies that if R is true, then ~H is true. So, R → ~H. And ~H ↔ R would mean R → ~H and ~H → R. So, it's a biconditional, meaning both implications hold. Does the original statement support that?

The original statement says that doctors are helpful unless patients are rude. So, it's saying that H is true when R is false. But it doesn't say that ~H implies R. It could be that doctors aren't helpful for other reasons besides patients being rude. So, perhaps the biconditional is too strong because it would require that any time doctors aren't helpful, patients are rude, which the original statement doesn't specify.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, maybe option C is too strong because it implies a biconditional relationship. So, perhaps the correct answer isn't C after all.

Let me think again. The original statement: Doctors are helpful unless their patients are rude. So, the only time doctors aren't helpful is when patients are rude. So, it's saying that if doctors aren't helpful, then patients are rude. That would be ~H → R. Which is the contrapositive of R → ~H.

Wait, so ~H → R is equivalent to R ∨ ~H, which is option F. So, F is ~H ∨ R, which is equivalent to ~H → R. But wait, earlier I thought that the original statement was R → ~H, which is equivalent to ~R ∨ ~H.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

Original statement: Doctors are helpful unless patients are rude.

This can be phrased as: If patients are rude, then doctors are not helpful. So, R → ~H.

Alternatively, it can be phrased as: Doctors are helpful if patients are not rude. So, ~R → H.

Now, R → ~H is equivalent to ~R ∨ ~H.

~R → H is equivalent to R ∨ H.

Wait, that can't be right because R → ~H and ~R → H are contrapositives of each other, so they should be equivalent. But their equivalents in disjunctive form would be ~R ∨ ~H and R ∨ H, which are not equivalent.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me check:

R → ~H is equivalent to ~R ∨ ~H.

~R → H is equivalent to R ∨ H.

Wait, that would mean R → ~H is equivalent to ~R ∨ ~H, which is the same as ~ (R ∧ H).

But ~R ∨ ~H is not equivalent to R ∨ H. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the original statement is best represented as R → ~H, which is equivalent to ~R ∨ ~H. But looking at the options, none of them have ~R ∨ ~H. So, perhaps I need to find another way.

Wait, looking at the options again, option J is H ∨ ~R. So, that would be H or not R. Which is equivalent to ~R ∨ H, which is the same as ~R → H. So, H ∨ ~R is equivalent to ~R → H, which is the contrapositive of R → ~H, meaning they are equivalent.

Wait, so R → ~H is equivalent to ~R → H, which is equivalent to H ∨ ~R (option J). So, option J would be the correct symbolization.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the original statement implies R → ~H, which is equivalent to ~R ∨ ~H, but that's not an option. However, ~R ∨ H is option J, which is equivalent to ~R → H, which is the contrapositive of R → ~H. So, they are equivalent.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option J: H ∨ ~R.

Wait, but let me think again. The original statement is "Doctors are helpful unless their patients are rude." So, it's saying that the only time doctors aren't helpful is when patients are rude. So, it's allowing for doctors to be helpful in all cases except when patients are rude.

So, H is true whenever R is false. So, H is true if R is false, which is H ∨ ~R. Because if R is false, H must be true. If R is true, H can be either true or false? Wait, no, because the original statement says that when R is true, H is false. So, H must be false when R is true. So, H is true only when R is false.

So, H is true exactly when R is false. So, H ≡ ~R. But that's not an option. Alternatively, H → ~R would mean that if doctors are helpful, then patients are not rude. Which is true, but the original statement also implies that if patients are rude, doctors are not helpful, which is R → ~H.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to construct a truth table for each option and see which one matches the original statement.

The original statement can be represented as: H unless R. So, H is true when R is false, and H is false when R is true.

So, the truth table would be:

R | H
T | F
F | T

So, only two rows, but the options are formulas, so let's see which option's truth table matches this.

Looking at option J: H ∨ ~R.

So, H ∨ ~R is true when H is true or R is false. Let's see:

When R is true (T), H ∨ ~R becomes H ∨ F, which is H. But according to the original statement, when R is T, H must be F. So, H ∨ ~R would be F ∨ F = F, which matches.

When R is F, H ∨ ~R becomes H ∨ T, which is T, which matches because H must be T.

So, option J's truth table matches the original statement.

Wait, but let me check another option. Option F is ~H ∨ R, which is equivalent to H → R.

So, when R is T, ~H ∨ R is ~H ∨ T = T, which doesn't enforce H to be F. It just requires that if H is T, then R must be T. But in the original statement, when R is T, H must be F. So, option F doesn't capture that.

Option C is ~H ↔ R, which means ~H and R are equivalent. So, when R is T, ~H is T, so H is F. When R is F, ~H is F, so H is T. That matches the original statement. But wait, earlier I thought that the original statement doesn't necessarily imply that ~H only when R is T, but perhaps it does.

Wait, the original statement says that doctors are helpful unless their patients are rude. So, it's saying that the only reason doctors wouldn't be helpful is if patients are rude. So, if doctors aren't helpful (~H), then patients must be rude (R). So, ~H → R, which is equivalent to H ∨ R. But that's option A. Hmm, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no. ~H → R is equivalent to H ∨ R. So, option A is H ∨ R, which would mean that either doctors are helpful or patients are rude. But according to the original statement, when patients are rude, doctors aren't helpful, so H would be F and R would be T. So, H ∨ R would be T in that case, which is correct. When R is F, H must be T, so H ∨ R would be T. So, option A would always be T, which isn't correct because the original statement allows for cases where both H and R are F (though perhaps in reality, if R is F, H must be T).

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to approach this differently.

The correct logical representation should be R → ~H, which is equivalent to ~R ∨ ~H. But none of the options have ~R ∨ ~H. So, perhaps the closest is option J: H ∨ ~R, which is equivalent to ~R ∨ H.

Wait, but ~R ∨ H is not the same as ~R ∨ ~H. So, I'm not sure. Alternatively,
