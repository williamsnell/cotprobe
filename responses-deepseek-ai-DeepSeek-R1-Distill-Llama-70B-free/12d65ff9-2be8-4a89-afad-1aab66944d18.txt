Okay, so I've got this economics question here about marginal cost, average variable cost, and average total cost. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking when MC is equal to both AVC and ATC. Hmm. I remember that these cost curves have specific shapes and relationships. Let me visualize them. I think the marginal cost curve is typically U-shaped, first falling and then rising. The average variable cost (AVC) and average total cost (ATC) curves are also U-shaped but are above the MC curve at certain points.

Wait, right, I remember that the MC curve intersects the AVC curve at its minimum point. Oh yes, because when MC is below AVC, AVC is falling, and when MC is above AVC, it starts rising. So the point where MC equals AVC is the bottom of the AVC curve. Same logic applies to ATC, I think. The MC curve intersects ATC at its minimum point too. Because beyond that point, as production increases, ATC starts to rise again.

So the question is when MC equals both AVC and ATC. That would be at their lowest points, when the curves cross. So looking at the options, I need to find the one that says MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points.

Looking at the options:

Option H says "MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points." That sounds right. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Option A says MC intersects them at their average points. Not sure what that means exactly. Maybe not the right term. 

Option C talks about maximum points, but costs are minimized, not maximized, so that's probably not it.

Options B, D, F, I compare whether costs are greater or less than MC, but the question is about the point where they're equal, so these might not be the right choices.

Options E, G, J mention MC's points, like average point, minimum, maximum. Wait, I think in the case of ATC and AVC, when MC cuts through them, it's at their respective minima, not MC's. So E says they intersect MC at its average point, which doesn't sound right. G says they intersect MC at its minimum. Wait, the MC curve's minimum is actually where it's lowest, but for AVC and ATC, their minimum is where MC crosses them, not necessarily the MC's minimum.

Wait, actually, the MC curve is rising after a certain point, and for AVC and ATC, their minima occur where MC equals them. So the correct point is when MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points. So option H should be correct.

The question asks when marginal cost (MC) is equal to both average variable cost (AVC) and average total cost (ATC). The key to answering this lies in understanding the relationship between these cost curves. The MC curve is U-shaped, first falling and then rising. AVC and ATC are also U-shaped but are positioned above the MC curve at certain points. Specifically, the MC curve intersects the AVC curve at its minimum point and the ATC curve at its minimum point. This occurs because, beyond these intersection points, AVC and ATC begin to rise as production increases.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option H** correctly states that "MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points," which aligns with the economic principles described.
- Other options either refer to incorrect points (e.g., maximum points, average points) or mischaracterize the relationship between the curves.

Thus, the correct answer is:

H: MC intersects AVC and ATC at their minimum points.

Answer: H
