Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about test construction and evaluation, specifically focusing on what validity means. Hmm, I remember that validity is a key concept in testing, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think this through.

The question is asking about validity, and the options are from A to J. I need to pick the correct one. Validity, from what I recall, is about whether the test actually measures what it's supposed to measure. Like, if a test is designed to assess mathematical skills, does it really do that? That makes sense because if a test doesn't measure what it's intended to, then it's not very useful.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Includes diverse question types. I think that's more about the variety of the test, maybe related to content validity, but not the overall definition of validity itself. 

Option B: Has been piloted and statistically analyzed. Piloting is part of test development, and statistical analysis could relate to reliability or validity, but I don't think that's the direct definition of validity.

Option C: Yields consistent results. Oh, that sounds like reliability, not validity. Reliability is about consistency across administrations, while validity is about accuracy of measurement.

Option D: Questions closely related. That might be about internal consistency, which again is a type of reliability, not validity.

Option E: Completed within reasonable time. That's more about practicality or test administration, not validity.

Option F: Norms based on a sample. Norms relate to how test scores are interpreted, maybe standardization, but not directly about validity.

Option G: Applicable to many individuals. This could be about the generalizability of the test, but not the core concept of validity.

Option H: Easy to understand. That's about test clarity or face validity maybe, but not the main definition.

Option I: Measures what it purports to measure. This rings a bell. Yes, validity is precisely about whether the test measures the intended construct. So this seems correct.

Option J: Approved by a testing body. That's more about standardization or certification, not the essence of validity.

Wait, just to make sure I'm not mixing things up. Validity is about measurement accuracy. So if a test is valid, it's accurately measuring the skill or trait it's supposed to. So the correct answer should be I.

The question asks about the definition of validity in test construction and evaluation. Validity refers to the degree to which a test measures what it is intended to measure. Among the options, the correct answer is the one that directly aligns with this definition.

- **Option A** refers to diverse question types, which relates to content validity but not the overall definition.
- **Option B** discusses piloting and statistical analysis, which are part of test development but not the definition of validity.
- **Option C** pertains to consistent results, which is about reliability, not validity.
- **Option D** mentions closely related questions, which relates to internal consistency, a type of reliability.
- **Option E** concerns test completion time, which is about practicality, not validity.
- **Option F** refers to norms, which relate to score interpretation, not validity.
- **Option G** discusses applicability to many individuals, which is about generalizability, not validity.
- **Option H** talks about test clarity, which may relate to face validity but not the core definition.
- **Option I** states that the test measures what it purports to measure, which aligns directly with the definition of validity.
- **Option J** refers to approval by a testing body, which is about certification, not validity.

The correct answer is **I**, as it accurately captures the essence of validity.

Answer: I
