Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about a mixture of nitrogen (N₂) and oxygen (O₂) gases. The mixture has equal weights of each gas. We're given their absolute velocities as v_N2 = -7i m/s and v_O2 = +7i m/s. We need to find the mass average velocity and the molar average velocity.

Hmm, I remember that average velocities can be calculated in two ways: mass average (or mass-weighted) and molar average (mole-weighted). Oh wait, mass average velocity is based on the mass of each component, while molar average is based on the number of moles.

Since the weights are equal, that means the masses are equal too, right? Because weight is mass times gravity, but since they're both in the same gravitational field, equal weights imply equal masses. So each gas contributes the same mass.

Wait, but what's their molar masses? Nitrogen (N₂) has a molar mass of about 28 g/mol (since each N is 14, times two). Oxygen (O₂) is 32 g/mol (16 each). Oh wait, but their masses are equal in the mixture. So let me think, the mass of N₂ and O₂ are the same. Let's say each has mass m. Then the number of moles for each would be m/(M), where M is their respective molar masses.

So the number of moles of N₂ is m/28 and O₂ is m/32. Because moles = mass/molar mass.

Now, for the mass average velocity. The formula is (mass1 * velocity1 + mass2 * velocity2) / total mass. Since mass1 = mass2 = m, this becomes (m*(-7i) + m*(7i)) / (2m). The m's cancel out, and (-7 +7) is zero. So mass average velocity is 0.

Wait, that's the mass average. So the mass average velocity is zero. So looking at the options, let's see which have 0 for mass average.

Looking at the options, B, G, and J have 0 for mass average? Wait, no. Let me check each option.

Option B: Mass average is 0, molar average is -0.42i. Hmm, that's possible.

Option G: Mass average is 0, molar average 7i. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because if the velocities are opposite and their mole contributions differ, maybe the molar average isn't zero.

So next, the molar average velocity. The formula is (n1*v1 + n2*v2)/(n1 +n2). Since n1 and n2 are moles of each gas.

n1 is moles of N₂: m/(28). n2 is m/(32).

So plugging in:

Molar average velocity = [ (m/28)*(-7i) + (m/32)*(7i) ) ] / [ (m/28) + (m/32) ) ]

The m in numerator and denominator cancels out.

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (-7/28 + 7/32) * m * i. Wait, no, actually:

Numerator: (m/28)*(-7) + (m/32)*(7) all multiplied by i.

So factor out 7m i:

7m i [ (-1/28) + (1/32) ) ]

Calculate the terms inside the brackets: (-1/28 + 1/32) = -(32 -28)/(28*32) )= (-4)/(896) )= -1/224.

So numerator is 7m i * (-1/224) = (-7m i )/(224) )= (-m i )/(32).

Wait, 7 divided by 224 is 1/32, because 224 is 32 *7.

Denominator: (m/28 + m/32) = m(1/28 +1/32) = m ( (32 +28 )/(28*32) )= m (60)/(896) )= m*(15/224).

So denominator is m*15/224.

Putting it together, molar average is [ (-m i/32) ] / [ (15 m /224) ) ].

The m's cancel. So (-1/32) / (15/224) ) = (-1/32) * (224/15) )= (-7/15) i.

Wait, 224 divided by 32 is 7. So 224/32 =7. So 224/(32*15) = 7/(15). So the result is -7/15 i m/s.

Calculating 7/15: 7 divided by 15 is approximately 0.4667, so about -0.4667i.

Wait, but looking at the options, some have -0.42i. Hmm, maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the molar average calculation.

Numerator: (n1 v1 + n2 v2) = (m/28)*(-7) + (m/32)*(7).

Factor out 7m: 7m [ (-1/28) + (1/32) ) ]

Compute the bracket: (-1/28 + 1/32 ) = (-32 +28)/(28*32) )= (-4)/(896) )= -1/224.

So numerator is 7m * (-1/224) = -7m/(224) = -m/32.

Denominator: n1 +n2 = (m/28 + m/32) = m(32 +28)/(28*32) ) = m(60/(896)) )= (15 m)/( 224 ).

So molar average: (-m/32 ) / (15 m/224 ) = (-1/32) * (224/15) )= (-7/15) i m/s.

Wait, 224/32 is 7, so 7/15 is approximately 0.4667. So the molar average is about -0.4667 i m/s.

But looking at the options, I don't see exactly -7/15. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option B: molar is -0.42i. That's close to -0.4667, but not exact. Hmm. Maybe the numbers are approximated. Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute the exact fraction.

7/15 is 0.466666..., so approximately 0.467. Option B says -0.42i, which is 0.42, which is a bit less than 0.467. Maybe the question expects an exact value but perhaps the options have rounded it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express 7/15 as a decimal more accurately. Wait, 7 ÷15 is 0.46666..., which is approximately 0.467. So perhaps the option expects it as 0.42, but maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the exact terms. Let me recompute.

Molar average velocity:

n1 = m/(28), n2 =m/(32).

So numerator is n1 v1 + n2 v2 = (m/28)(-7) + (m/32)(7) = m*(-7/28 +7/32).

Let me compute 7/28 and 7/32.

7/28 = 0.25, 7/32 ≈ 0.21875.

So -0.25 + 0.21875 = -0.03125.

So numerator is m*(-0.03125) i.

Denominator: n1 +n2= m/28 + m/32 = m*(1/28 + 1/32 )= m*( (32+28)/(28*32) )= m*(60/(896))= m*(15/224).

So denominator is m*(15/224) = m*(0.066964...).

So molar average velocity is (-0.03125 m) / (0.066964 m) i.

The m's cancel, so it's (-0.03125)/(0.066964) i.

Compute that: 0.03125 / 0.066964 ≈ 0.46666.

So it's -0.46666 i m/s, which is approximately -0.467 i.

Looking back at the options, none of them exactly match this. Hmm, but looking at the options:

Option B: Molar average is -0.42i.

Option J: Molar average is -0.42i? Let me check. No, option J's molar average is -0.42i, but the mass average is 0.42i. Wait, no, option J: average mass is 0.42i, molar average is -0.42i. So that's not matching, because our mass average is 0.

Wait, but according to our calculation, mass average is 0, and molar average is approximately -0.467. So looking for an option where mass average is 0 and molar is approx -0.42.

Wait, let's check the options again.

Option B: mass average 0, molar average -0.42i. That fits.

But wait, why is the molar average negative? Because the numerator was negative. Because nitrogen has a higher mole fraction but negative velocity.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the molar average in terms of exact fractions.

Wait, 7/15 is approximately 0.4667, which is about 0.467. But none of the options have that. The closest is option B with -0.42, which is 0.42. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the molar average correctly.

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator again.

Numerator: (m/28)(-7) + (m/32)(7) = m [ (-7/28) + (7/32) ) ].

Calculate each term:

7/28 = 1/4 = 0.25. So -0.25.

7/32 ≈ 0.21875.

So sum is (-0.25 +0.21875) = -0.03125.

So numerator is m*(-0.03125) i.

Denominator: (m/28 + m/32) = m (32 +28)/(28*32) ) = m (60)/(896) ) = m (15/224) ≈ m*(0.066964).

So the molar average is (-0.03125 / 0.066964 ) i = (-0.46666...) i.

So approximately -0.467 m/s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B, which says molar average is -0.42i. But that's a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects an exact fraction, but let me see.

Wait, 7/15 is exactly 0.46666..., which is approximately 0.467. However, none of the options have this exact figure. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should compute using the mole fractions. Let me think again.

The mole fraction of N2 is (n1)/(n1 +n2) = (m/28)/(m/28 + m/32) ) = (1/28)/(1/28 +1/32) ) = (1/28) / ( (32+28)/(28*32) ) ) ) = (1/28) * (28*32)/(60) )= 32/60 = 8/15.

Similarly, mole fraction of O2 is 7/15.

So molar average velocity is (8/15)(-7i) + (7/15)(7i) ?

Wait no, wait, no. The mole fractions are 8/15 for N2 and 7/15 for O2. So the molar average is (8/15)(-7i) + (7/15)(7i) = [ (-56/15) + 49/15 ] i = (-7/15) i.

Which is again 7/15 ≈0.4667, so negative, so -0.4667i.

But no option exactly has that. So perhaps the options have rounded it to -0.42, which is approximately 7/15 *0.42 is about 0.42.

Wait, 0.42 is approximately 21/50. Hmm, 7/15 is approximately 0.4667. It's closer to 0.467 than 0.42.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another approach: Since the mass of N2 and O2 are the same, let's take m=28g for N2 and m=28g for O2. Wait, no, because their molar masses are different, so for same mass, moles would be different.

Wait, perhaps taking m as the mass of each gas. Let me set m = mass of N2 = mass of O2.

Moles of N2: m/(28 g/mol) = m/28.

Moles of O2: m/(32 g/mol) = m/32.

So the total moles n_total = m/28 + m/32 = m(1/28 +1/32) )= m (32+28)/(28*32) )= m(60)/(896) )= (15 m)/224.

Molar average velocity is (n_N2 * v_N2 + n_O2 * v_O2 ) / n_total.

So that's [ (m/28)*(-7) + (m/32)*(7) ] / (15m/224).

Factor out m and 7:

Numerator: 7m [ (-1/28) + (1/32) ] = 7m [ (-32 +28)/(28*32) ) ] = 7m (-4)/(896) ) = 7m (-1/224) ) = -7m/224.

Denominator: 15 m/224.

So molar average = (-7m/224) / (15m/224) )= (-7/15) i m/s.

Same result as before. So approximately -0.4667i.

Hmm, but none of the options have exactly that. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, which has molar average of -0.42i. But why 0.42?

Wait, 7/15 is about 0.4667. 0.42 is closer to 21/50, which is 0.42. Alternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated.

Wait, maybe I should compute 7/15 exactly. 15 times 0.4667 is 7. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question uses the molar average formula as (n1 v1 + n2 v2) divided by (n1 +n2). Which is what I did.

So perhaps the correct option is B, which states mass average 0 and molar average -0.42i.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the velocities are given as v_N2 and v_O2, but the way I used them is correct.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option B: mass average 0, molar average -0.42i.

Option J: mass average 0.42i, molar average -0.42i. But our mass average is 0, so J is not correct.

So the correct answer should be option B, but let me check why the molar average in B is -0.42i. Well, perhaps it's an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use volume fractions instead of mole fractions, but that's unlikely because the question specifies molar average.

Wait, another approach: since the masses are equal, and the molar masses are 28 and 32, the mole ratio is (m/28) : (m/32) )= 32 :28 = 8:7.

So the mole fraction of N2 is 8/(8+7) =8/15, O2 is7/15.

Then the molar average is (8/15)(-7) + (7/15)(7) )= (-56/15 +49/15 )= (-7/15 )= approx -0.467 m/s.

So the exact value is -7/15 i, which is about -0.467 i.

But none of the options have that exact value. So perhaps the question intended the molar average to be -0.42i, which is option B. So the answer should be B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the mixture of N₂ and O₂ gases with equal weights. The absolute velocities are given as:

- **vₙ₂ = -7i m/s** (for N₂)
- **vₒ₂ = +7i m/s** (for O₂)

We calculate the **mass average velocity** and the **molar average velocity**.

---

### **1. Mass Average Velocity**
The mass average velocity is calculated as:

\[
v_{\text{mass}} = \frac{m_{\text{N}_2} v_{\text{N}_2} + m_{\text{O}_2} v_{\text{O}_2}}{m_{\text{N}_2} + m_{\text{O}_2}}
\]

Since the masses of N₂ and O₂ are equal (\(m_{\text{N}_2} = m_{\text{O}_2} = m\)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
v_{\text{mass}} = \frac{m(-7i) + m(7i)}{2m} = \frac{-7i + 7i}{2} = 0
\]

Thus, the **mass average velocity is 0**.

---

### **2. Molar Average Velocity**
The molar average velocity is calculated as:

\[
v_{\text{molar}} = \frac{n_{\text{N}_2} v_{\text{N}_2} + n_{\text{O}_2} v_{\text{O}_2}}{n_{\text{N}_2} + n_{\text{O}_2}}
\]

The number of moles of each gas is:

\[
n_{\text{N}_2} = \frac{m}{28}, \quad n_{\text{O}_2} = \frac{m}{32}
\]

Substituting these into the formula:

\[
v_{\text{molar}} = \frac{\left(\frac{m}{28}\right)(-7i) + \left(\frac{m}{32}\right)(7i)}{\frac{m}{28} + \frac{m}{32}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:
