Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again: The least common multiple (LCM) of two integers is 240, and the greatest common divisor (GCD) is 24. One of the integers is 48, and I need to find the other one. The options are A through J, with various numbers.

Hmm, I remember there's a relationship between LCM and GCD of two numbers. Oh right, the product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their LCM and GCD. So if the numbers are a and b, then a * b = LCM(a,b) * GCD(a,b). That makes sense because LCM deals with multiples and GCD with divisors, so combining them covers the product.

So in this problem, one number is 48, let's call it a. The other is b, which we're trying to find. The LCM is 240, and the GCD is 24. Plugging into the formula: 48 * b = 240 * 24.

Let me compute the right side first. 240 times 24... 240 * 20 is 4800, and 240 *4 is 960, so 4800 + 960 = 5760. So 48 * b = 5760.

To find b, I divide 5760 by 48. Let's see, 48 times 120 is 5760 because 48*100=4800 and 48*20=960, so 4800+960=5760. So b is 120.

Wait, but let me double-check. If the two numbers are 48 and 120, what's their GCD? Let's see. The factors of 48 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48. For 120, factors include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120. The common factors are up to 24, so GCD is 24. That matches.

And the LCM should be 240. Let's compute LCM of 48 and 120 another way. Prime factors: 48 is 2^4 *3^1. 120 is 2^3 *3^1 *5^1. The LCM takes the highest powers: 2^4, 3^1, 5^1. So 16 *3=48, 48*5=240. Yep, that's correct.

So the other number must be 120. Looking at the options, option C is 120. So the answer should be C.

The product of two integers is equal to the product of their least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (GCD). Given one integer is 48, the LCM is 240, and the GCD is 24, we use the formula:

\[
a \cdot b = \text{LCM}(a, b) \cdot \text{GCD}(a, b)
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
48 \cdot b = 240 \cdot 24
\]

Calculating the right-hand side:

\[
240 \cdot 24 = 5760
\]

Solving for \(b\):

\[
b = \frac{5760}{48} = 120
\]

Verifying, the GCD of 48 and 120 is 24, and their LCM is 240, confirming the calculation is correct. Thus, the other integer is 120.

Answer: C
