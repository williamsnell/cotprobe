Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about West's account regarding women who engage in undesired sex due to actual or felt dependence on their partner. The question is about why this situation injures their sense of autonomy.

Let me start by understanding the question. Autonomy has to do with self-governance, right? So if someone's autonomy is injured, they feel like they can't make their own decisions freely.

West's argument, as I remember from some readings, is about how economic dependence can impact a person's autonomy. So if a woman is financially dependent on her partner, she might feel she can't refuse sex because she fears the consequences, like losing financial support or the relationship ending.

Looking at the options:

Option A says they are dominated because they're not free to do as they please. That seems related, but I'm not sure if it's specific enough.

Option B suggests actual coercion, which is more about force rather than dependence. Coercion might be a different issue.

Option C is about financial dependence. That aligns with what I was thinking about economic factors affecting autonomy.

Option D is fear of consequences. That's also a possibility because fear could limit someone's ability to make free choices.

Option E is about not setting boundaries, which is a different issue, more about communication in the relationship rather than dependence.

Option G talks about manipulation tactics. That's a form of coercion, so maybe that's covered in B.

Option H is feeling obliged to fulfill the partner's desires. That could be due to dependence, but is it the primary reason for the autonomy injury?

Option I is societal pressure, which is a broader issue but maybe not directly tied to dependence on a partner.

Option J is about neglecting self-sustenance steps. That's more about the cause of dependence rather than the injury to autonomy.

So, the key here is the reason why dependence leads to autonomy injury. If a woman feels she can't say no because she's dependent, it's because she fears the consequences, like losing support. So Option D says they fear the consequences of refusal.

Wait, but West's account specifically ties it to economic dependence. So is the injury because of the dependence itself (C) or because of the fear that comes from it (D)?

Hmm, I think the injury to autonomy isn't just about the fact of dependence (C) but how that dependence makes them feel they can't make a free choice. So the immediate cause is the fear of consequences, which stems from the dependence.

So the best answer would be D. But wait, let me make sure.

Wait, another angle: West argues that when you're dependent, you lose autonomy because your choices are constrained by the possibility of losing the resources you depend on. So the autonomy injury is because the dependence (whether actual or felt) makes you feel you have no choice but to comply to avoid negative outcomes.

So the correct answer would be D: they fear the consequences of refusing their partner.

Alternatively, Option C is about being financially dependent, which is a cause, but the injury is because of the fear, so D is the effect.

So I think D is the right answer.

The question revolves around West's account of how women's autonomy is injured when they engage in undesired sex due to dependence on their partner. Autonomy refers to the ability to make free choices, and the injury occurs when this freedom is compromised.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** discusses domination and lack of freedom but is too vague.
- **Option B** refers to coercion, which is more about force than dependence.
- **Option C** focuses on financial dependence, a key aspect but not the direct cause of autonomy injury.
- **Option D** highlights fear of consequences, which directly explains the compromised autonomy due to dependence.
- **Option E** is about boundaries, a separate issue.
- **Option G** involves manipulation, a form of coercion.
- **Option H** is about obligation, which stems from dependence but isn't the primary reason for autonomy injury.
- **Option I** refers to societal pressure, a broader issue.
- **Option J** discusses self-sustenance, more about causing dependence.

West's argument ties autonomy injury to the fear of consequences stemming from dependence. Thus, the correct answer is **D**, as it captures the immediate cause of the injury.

Answer: D
