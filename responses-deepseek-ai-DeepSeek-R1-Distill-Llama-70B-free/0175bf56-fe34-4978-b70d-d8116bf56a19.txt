B: It is a catalyst that alters the rate of a reaction.
C: It is operative over a wide pH range.
D: The rate of catalysis is affected by the concentration of substrate.

Okay, so I have this question about trypsin, and I need to figure out which statement is not true. Hmm, trypsin is an enzyme, right? I remember enzymes are proteins, so let me think about each option.

Option A says trypsin is an organic compound made of proteins. Well, proteins are made of amino acids, so trypsin being a protein makes it an organic compound. So A is true, not the answer.

Option B says it's a catalyst that alters the rate of a reaction. Enzymes are biological catalysts, so B is definitely true. So B is not the incorrect statement.

Option C claims it's operative over a wide pH range. Wait, I thought enzymes have an optimal pH. Trypsin works best around pH 8, which is slightly alkaline. If the pH is too high or too low, the enzyme's structure denatures, and it stops working. So it doesn't work well over a wide pH range. So C is probably the false statement. But let me check the last option.

Option D says the rate of catalysis is affected by substrate concentration. Oh right, enzymes have a saturation point. At low substrate concentrations, increasing substrate increases the reaction rate. But once all active sites are filled, adding more doesn't change the rate. So D is true; the rate does depend on substrate concentration up to a point. So the false statement is option C.

The statement that is NOT true about trypsin is:

**C: It is operative over a wide pH range.**

Trypsin, like most enzymes, functions optimally within a narrow pH range (around pH 8 for trypsin). Extreme deviations from this range can denature the enzyme, disrupting its activity. Therefore, it is not operative over a wide pH range.

Answer: C
