Question:

A man and a woman were arrested and charged with bank robbery. After receiving Miranda warnings, both requested an attorney. Following their arrests, the man and the woman were placed in separate jail cells. The next day before arraignment, the man asked a police officer if he could see his friend, the woman. The man was taken to the woman's jail cell and allowed to talk to her. Neither defendant knew that the police had placed a listening device in the woman's jail cell. As a result, their conversation was being overheard and recorded by the police. The police planted the listening device without first securing a warrant. While they were together, the man told the woman not to admit to anything because they could beat the charges with the help of a good lawyer. At trial, the prosecution sought to introduce the man's incriminating statement into evidence. The man's attorney has filed a motion to exclude. The motion should be

Options:

A: denied, because the statement did not violate the man's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.
B: denied, because the conversation occurred after the defendants were given their Miranda warnings.
C: granted, because the man was not informed that his conversation would be recorded.
D: denied, because the man voluntarily made the statement to the woman.
E: denied, because the defendants did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.
F: granted, because the police used illegal methods to gather evidence.
G: granted, because both defendants requested an attorney before engaging in their conversation.
H: granted, because the police violated the woman's privacy by placing a listening device in her cell.
I: denied, because the defendants were in police custody and should have assumed their conversation could be overheard.

Okay, so I have this legal question about evidence suppression, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me try to break down the scenario and the possible answers step by step.

The question involves a man and a woman arrested for bank robbery. They both requested an attorney after being read their Miranda rights. They were placed in separate cells. The next day, before arraignment, the man asked to see the woman. The police allowed them to talk in her cell without knowing there was a listening device planted without a warrant. The police overheard and recorded their conversation, where the man told her not to admit anything because they could beat the charges with a good lawyer. At trial, the prosecution wants to use this statement, and the defense is moving to exclude it.

So, the issue here is whether the man's statement can be admitted into evidence. The defense is arguing that it should be excluded, so the options are about whether the motion should be granted or denied.

First, I need to consider the legal principles involved. Miranda rights, the Fifth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, and the concept of a reasonable expectation of privacy.

Miranda v. Arizona established that statements made while in custody without Miranda warnings are inadmissible. But here, both were read their rights and requested an attorney, so Miranda issues might not be the main point. However, once they request an attorney, under the Fifth Amendment, police are not allowed to interrogate them unless the attorney is present. But this situation isn't exactly an interrogation; it's a conversation between the two defendants.

Wait, but they were allowed to talk without the presence of an attorney. So maybe the issue is about the right to counsel being violated. But the question is about the admissibility of the statement, so perhaps the recording of their conversation without a warrant is the main issue.

The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Placing a listening device in the cell without a warrant might be an illegal search. The police didn't get a warrant, so this could be an issue. But do the defendants have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the jail cell?

In a jail, the expectation of privacy is limited. Courts have held that prisoners have a reduced expectation of privacy because of the nature of incarceration. For example, in Hudson v. Palmer, the Supreme Court said that prisoners have no reasonable expectation of privacy in their cells for searches by prison guards. But does this extend to police placing a listening device?

Wait, but the police planted the device, not prison guards. Also, the conversation was between two people, so maybe the expectation of privacy applies when they're talking privately. But in a jail cell, is any conversation considered private?

I remember the case of Katz v. United States, where the Court said that the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places, and that a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in a phone booth. So if the defendants thought their conversation was private, even in jail, maybe they have a reasonable expectation.

But in this case, they were in a jail cell, so perhaps the expectation is lower. Also, the man was taken to the woman's cell, so maybe the police allowed them to talk, but the recording was done without their knowledge.

Another angle: the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Once the defendants requested an attorney, any waiver of that right must be knowing and voluntary. If the police allowed them to talk without their attorneys present, that might be a violation. But I'm not sure how that directly affects the admissibility of their conversation.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Denied because no Fifth Amendment violation. Well, the Fifth Amendment is about self-incrimination, but the statement was voluntary, so maybe it doesn't apply. But the issue is more about the Fourth Amendment.

Option B: Denied because Miranda warnings were given. But they were given, but they requested an attorney. So Miranda might not be the issue here.

Option C: Granted because not informed conversation was recorded. I'm not sure if the lack of informing makes it inadmissible. The issue is more about the warrantless recording.

Option D: Denied because voluntary. But the voluntariness might not matter if the recording was illegal.

Option E: Denied because no reasonable expectation of privacy. This is a key point. If they didn't have a reasonable expectation, then the police's actions wouldn't be an unconstitutional search.

Option F: Granted because police used illegal methods. This would be if the recording was unconstitutional, i.e., without a warrant and without exigent circumstances. But again, it depends on their expectation of privacy.

Option G: Granted because both requested an attorney. This relates to the Sixth Amendment. If they requested an attorney, any questioning without the attorney present is prohibited. But here, they were talking to each other, not being questioned by police. So maybe not directly applicable.

Option H: Granted because the woman's privacy was violated. This goes back to the Fourth Amendment. If the listening device was placed in her cell without a warrant, and she had a reasonable expectation of privacy, then it's a violation.

Option I: Denied because in custody, so assume conversation could be overheard. This is similar to option E. If they're in custody, maybe they shouldn't expect privacy.

So, first, does the jail cell conversation have a reasonable expectation of privacy? Courts have generally held that inmates do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their cells because of the need for prison security. So, the police might have been allowed to monitor the cell without a warrant.

But wait, in this case, they placed a listening device without a warrant. If the expectation of privacy is absent, then the Fourth Amendment isn't violated, so the evidence wouldn't be suppressed.

So, if option E says "denied because no reasonable expectation of privacy," that would be the case if the court finds that they didn't have such an expectation.

Alternatively, if the court finds that they did have a reasonable expectation, then the warrantless recording would be a Fourth Amendment violation, making the evidence inadmissible. So F or H would be correct in that case.

I think the key issue here is whether the defendants had a reasonable expectation of privacy in their jail cell conversation. In most cases, prisoners are not allowed privacy in their cells, so the police can monitor without a warrant.

Therefore, the police's actions might not have violated the Fourth Amendment because the defendants lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy. So the statement would be admissible, and the motion to exclude should be denied.

Looking at the options, E says "denied because defendants did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy." That seems to fit.

Alternatively, if the court considers that while in custody, any private conversation between defendants is protected, then it would be a different outcome. But I think the expectation of privacy in jail is minimal.

So the answer would be E: denied because no reasonable expectation of privacy.

The question revolves around whether the man's incriminating statement, made to the woman in her jail cell and overheard via a police-planted listening device, should be excluded from evidence. The key legal issues involve the Fourth Amendment (protection against unreasonable searches and seizures) and the reasonable expectation of privacy.

After being arrested and requesting attorneys, the man and woman were placed in separate cells. The police allowed them to talk in the woman's cell without disclosing the presence of a listening device, which was planted without a warrant. The man's statement was recorded and later sought to be introduced at trial, prompting a motion to exclude it.

The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, but individuals in custody, particularly in jail cells, have a reduced expectation of privacy due to the nature of incarceration. Courts have consistently held that prisoners do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their cells, as prison authorities often monitor activities for security purposes. This diminished expectation of privacy extends to conversations within the cell, even if they involve private discussions between defendants.

Given these principles, the police's placement of a listening device in the woman's cell, without a warrant, does not constitute an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment because the defendants lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in that setting. Therefore, the man's statement is admissible, and the motion to exclude it should be denied.

The correct answer is **E: denied, because the defendants did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy**.
