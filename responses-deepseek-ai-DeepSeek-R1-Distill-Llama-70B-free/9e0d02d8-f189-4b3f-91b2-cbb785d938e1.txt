Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Velleman's beliefs on euthanasia. Let me start by recalling what I know about Velleman's arguments. I remember that he's a philosopher who has written about the ethics of euthanasia, and he's particularly concerned with how the option of euthanasia might affect patients negatively.

The question is asking what Velleman thinks is the most significant way euthanasia might harm some patients. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different potential harm.

I think Velleman's main concern is about the psychological impact on the patient. He argues that knowing that euthanasia is an option could burden the patient. Specifically, patients might feel like they need to justify their existence, especially if they're already feeling like a burden to their family or society. This pressure could lead them to choose euthanasia not because they truly want to, but because they feel it's what others expect or to relieve the burden they think they're causing.

Looking at the options, option B says "by burdening a patient with having to justify his or her continued existence." That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. Velleman is worried that patients might feel compelled to end their lives because they don't want to be a burden, rather than making a truly autonomous choice.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing this with another philosopher. I think Velleman emphasizes the importance of patient autonomy and the potential for subtle coercion. He might argue that the availability of euthanasia undermines the patient's sense of self-worth, making them feel like they need to justify why they should live. This could lead to a kind of emotional or psychological pressure that's not in the patient's best interest.

So, the correct answer should be option B. Let me just scan the other options to make sure I'm not missing anything. Option J talks about societal pressure, which is similar but broader. Velleman's point is more about the individual's internalized feeling of being a burden, not necessarily societal pressure. So B is more specific and accurate in this context.

Velleman is concerned that the option of euthanasia might harm patients by burdening them with the need to justify their continued existence. This could lead patients to feel compelled to end their lives due to feelings of being a burden, rather than making a truly autonomous choice. 

The correct answer is B.
