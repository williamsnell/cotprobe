Alright, so I've got this problem here about calculating the horsepower developed by a shaft. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, okay, the question says it's a 1-inch diameter solid shaft with a design shear stress of 8000 psi, transmitting power at 150 rpm. I need to find the horsepower.

Wait, I remember that power transmission in shafts involves torque and angular velocity. Oh right, the formula for horsepower is related to torque and rotational speed. Let me think. Oh yeah, the basic formula is Horsepower (hp) = (Torque * rpm) / 5252, but wait, I think the exact formula depends on units.

But wait, torque is related to shear stress and the shaft's dimensions. Shear stress (τ) is related to the torque (T) by the formula τ = (T * r) / J, where r is the radius and J is the polar moment of inertia. Oh right, for a solid shaft, J is (π/2) * r^4. Or wait, maybe it's (π d^4)/32 since diameter d is used. Yeah, because J for a solid shaft is (π d^4)/32.

So putting it together, the shear stress τ is equal to (T * r) / J. Let me rearrange that to solve for torque T. So T = (τ * J) / r.

But wait, let me plug in the values. The diameter is 1 inch, so radius r is 0.5 inches. Shear stress τ is 8000 psi. Let me compute J first.

J = (π d^4) / 32. Since d is 1 inch, d^4 is 1. So J = π * (1)^4 /32 = π/32. Then r is 0.5 inches.

So T = (τ * J) / r = (8000 psi * π/32) / 0.5. Wait, let me compute that step by step.

Calculating numerator: 8000 * π/32 = (8000/32) * π = 250 * π. Because 8000/32 is 250. So that's 250π.

Divide by r (0.5): 250π / 0.5 = 500π. So torque T is 500π inch-pounds. Because psi is pounds per square inch, so the units for torque would be in inch-pounds.

Wait, but torque is in foot-pounds when used in horsepower calculations. Oh right, because 1 foot-pound is 12 inch-pounds. So I need to convert inch-pounds to foot-pounds. So T = 500π / 12 foot-pounds.

Wait, let me compute that. 500 divided by 12 is approximately 41.6667. So 500π is about 500 * 3.1416 ≈ 1570.8. Then 1570.8 /12 is approximately 130.9 foot-pounds.

Wait, no. Wait, torque T is 500π inch-pounds. Since 1 foot-pound is 12 inch-pounds, so to get T in foot-pounds, divide by 12. So T = (500π) / 12 ≈ (500 * 3.1416)/12 ≈ (1570.8)/12 ≈ 130.9 foot-pounds.

Now, the rotational speed is 150 rpm. So plugging into the horsepower formula: hp = (T * rpm) / 5252.

So T is 130.9, rpm is 150. So 130.9 * 150 = let's calculate that. 130 *150 is 19,500. 0.9 *150 is 135. So total is 19,635.

Now, 19,635 divided by 5252. Let's see. 5252 times 3 is 15,756. 19,635 minus 15,756 is 3,879. 5252 goes into 3,879 about 0.738 times. So total is approximately 3.738.

Looking at the options, option E is 3.74 hp, which matches my calculation. So the answer should be E.

To calculate the horsepower (hp) developed by a 1-inch diameter solid shaft transmitting power at 150 rpm with a design shear stress of 8000 psi, we proceed as follows:

1. **Torque Calculation**:  
   The shear stress (\( \tau \)) is related to torque (\( T \)) by the formula:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{T \cdot r}{J}
   \]  
   Rearranging for \( T \):  
   \[
   T = \frac{\tau \cdot J}{r}
   \]  
   For a solid shaft, the polar moment of inertia (\( J \)) is:  
   \[
   J = \frac{\pi d^4}{32}
   \]  
   Substituting \( d = 1 \, \text{in} \) (\( r = 0.5 \, \text{in} \)) and \( \tau = 8000 \, \text{psi} \):  
   \[
   J = \frac{\pi (1)^4}{32} = \frac{\pi}{32}
   \]  
   \[
   T = \frac{8000 \cdot \frac{\pi}{32}}{0.5} = \frac{8000 \cdot \pi}{16} = 500\pi \, \text{inch-pounds}
   \]  
   Converting to foot-pounds (\( 1 \, \text{foot-pound} = 12 \, \text{inch-pounds} \)):  
   \[
   T = \frac{500\pi}{12} \approx 130.9 \, \text{foot-pounds}
   \]

2. **Horsepower Calculation**:  
   The formula for horsepower is:  
   \[
   \text{hp} = \frac{T \cdot \text{rpm}}{5252}
   \]  
   Substituting \( T \approx 130.9 \, \text{foot-pounds} \) and \( \text{rpm} = 150 \):  
   \[
   \text{hp} = \frac{130.9 \cdot 150}{5252} \approx \frac{19635}{5252} \approx 3.74 \, \text{hp}
   \]

3. **Final Answer**:  
   Comparing the result with the options, the closest match is **E: 3.74 hp**.
