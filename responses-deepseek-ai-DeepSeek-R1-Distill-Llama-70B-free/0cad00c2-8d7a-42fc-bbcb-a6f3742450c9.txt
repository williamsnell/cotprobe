Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step.

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate each as true or false. Then, based on that, choose the correct option from A to J. Wait, actually, the options are A through D, right? Because each option is a combination of the truth values of the two statements.

Let me look at the statements again.

Statement 1: When learning an HMM for a fixed set of observations, assume we do not know the true number of hidden states (which is often the case), we can always increase the training data likelihood by permitting more hidden states.

Hmm. I remember that HMM stands for Hidden Markov Model. These are used in machine learning for modeling systems that can be in one of several hidden states. The parameters include the transition probabilities, emission probabilities, and the initial state probabilities. 

Now, the statement says that if we don't know the number of hidden states, adding more states will always increase the training data likelihood. Likelihood here refers to the probability of observing the training data given the model parameters. So, when you increase the number of hidden states, you're adding more parameters to the model. 

In general, more complex models (with more parameters) can fit the training data better. So, for HMMs, increasing the number of states allows the model to capture more patterns in the data. For example, if the data has more variability that can't be explained by a smaller number of states, adding more states should allow the model to explain the data better. 

Wait, but is it always true? Because I remember something about overfitting. If you have too many states, the model might overfit the training data. But the question is about the likelihood on the training data, not generalization. Overfitting affects performance on unseen data, but the training likelihood could still increase.

So, adding more hidden states should allow the model to fit the training data better, thus increasing the likelihood. So Statement 1 seems to be true. 

Moving on to Statement 2: Collaborative filtering is often a useful model for modeling users' movie preferences.

Collaborative filtering is a technique used in recommendation systems. The idea is that users with similar preferences will like similar items. So, it's commonly used for things like movie recommendations, product recommendations on e-commerce sites, etc.

I remember services like Netflix and Amazon use collaborative filtering. It works by looking at the behavior or preferences of many users and finding patterns. So for movies, if user A and user B have similar ratings for several movies, the system can infer that they might have similar tastes and recommend movies that one has liked but the other hasn't seen yet.

So Statement 2 is definitely true. Collaborative filtering is a cornerstone in recommendation systems, especially for movies. 

So both statements are true. Looking at the options:

A: True, True â†’ That would be the correct choice.

Wait, but let me double-check Statement 1. I'm pretty sure about Statement 2, but Statement 1... When you increase the number of hidden states in an HMM, you do increase the model's capacity, which should allow it to fit the training data better, thus increasing the likelihood. But is there a point where adding more states doesn't help? Like, if the model is already perfectly fitting the data, adding more states might not change the likelihood. But in reality, for a fixed dataset, as you increase the number of states, the model can potentially represent any sequence with higher likelihood up to a point where it might even overfit.

Wait, but even if the model overfits, the training likelihood would still be higher. So yes, adding more states can always increase the likelihood on the training data. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.

So both statements are true, so the answer should be option A.
</think>

Statement 1: When learning an HMM for a fixed set of observations, assuming the true number of hidden states is unknown, increasing the number of hidden states can always improve the training data likelihood. This is because more hidden states allow the model to capture more patterns in the data, effectively increasing its capacity to fit the training data better. While overfitting can occur, the question specifically concerns the training likelihood, which generally increases with more states.

Statement 2: Collaborative filtering is a widely used and effective technique for modeling user preferences, particularly in recommendation systems like movie recommendations. It leverages the similarity in preferences among users to make predictions, making it a cornerstone in such applications.

Both statements are true.
