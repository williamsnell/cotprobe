Question:

A farmer was the fee-simple owner of a tract of land inthe country. The farmer moved to the city in 1986. Aman took possession of the land in 1987 as an adversepossessor and remained on the land from 1987 to 1997;he then left the property to care for his sick mother forone year, returning the following year, 1999. Assume that the statutory period for adverse possession in this state is 20 years. In 2010, the farmer wanted to move back to the tract because he desired to return to the country. Finding the man in possession, the farmer initiated a suit in ejectment against the man. The most probable judicial determination would be

Options:

A: the farmer would lose, because he had abandoned the property for over 20 years.
B: the farmer would win, because the man had not paid property taxes during his occupancy.
C: the farmer would lose, because the man's possession was open, hostile, and continuous.
D: the farmer would lose, because the man had fulfilled the required statutory period to become an adverse possessor.
E: the farmer would win, because the man did not have legal documentation of ownership.
F: the farmer would win, because the man had left the property for a year.
G: the farmer would win, because the man's possession was not continuous.
H: the farmer would lose, because the man was the current resident of the property.
I: the farmer would win, because he is the titleholder of record.
J: the farmer would lose, because the man had made improvements on the land.

Okay, so I've got this question about adverse possession, and I'm a bit new to this topic. Let's try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: There's a farmer who owns a tract of land. He moves to the city in 1986. Then, a man takes possession in 1987 as an adverse possessor. He stays there until 1997, leaves for a year to care for his sick mother, and comes back in 1999. The statutory period for adverse possession here is 20 years. In 2010, the farmer wants to move back and sues the man in ejectment. The question is about who would win.

So, I remember that adverse possession requires certain elements to be met. Typically, the possessor must have possession that is open, notorious, continuous, hostile (without permission), and actual. The time period must meet the statutory requirement, which here is 20 years.

Let's outline the timeline:

- Farmer moves out: 1986.
- Man takes possession: 1987.
- Man stays until 1997: that's 10 years.
- Leaves for 1 year (1997-1998), returns in 1999.
- So from 1999 onward, how long does he stay? The suit is in 2010. So from 1999 to 2010 is 11 years. But wait, he was there from 1987 to 1997 (10 years), then 1999 to 2010 (11 years). But there's a gap of one year.

Now, the big issue is whether the man's possession meets the continuity requirement. I think that for adverse possession, the possession needs to be continuous and without interruption. If he left for a year, does that break continuity?

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, if the adverse possessor leaves but their intention is to return, maybe the possession can still be considered continuous. Or perhaps the time starts over when he returns. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, the statutory period is 20 years. The man was there from 1987 to 1997 (10 years), left for a year, then from 1999 to 2010 is 11 years. So total time is 21 years, but with a one-year break. Does that break the continuity?

I think that the possession must be continuous. So if he left for a year, that might interrupt the continuity. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, some might argue that the time can be tacked on if the same person resumes possession after a temporary absence. But I'm not sure about the rules here.

Wait, another point: the farmer left in 1986, and the man took possession in 1987. So the man's possession begins in '87. The statutory period is 20 years, so by 2007, the man would have completed 20 years. But wait, he left in 1997 for a year, so maybe the time stops there?

Wait, let me calculate again. From 1987 to 1997 is 10 years. Then, he leaves, comes back in '99, and stays until 2010â€”so that's 11 years from '99 to 2010. So total time would be 10 + 11 = 21 years, but with a one-year gap. But the statutory period requires 20 years of continuous possession.

If the man's possession was interrupted, then maybe he hasn't met the 20-year requirement. Because the time before the interruption was only 10 years, and after returning, he's added 11 more, but perhaps the interruption breaks the continuity, so the time doesn't add up.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions allow for the time to be added together if the same person resumes possession, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, but the man's total time would be 21 years (10 + 11), but with a one-year break. If the law requires continuous possession, then the break would mean he hasn't met the 20 years yet. Because the first period was only 10 years, and the second is 11, but they aren't continuous.

So, in 2010, he's been back for 11 years, but the initial 10 were interrupted. So the total time is 21, but not continuous. So he hasn't completed 20 continuous years. Therefore, he hasn't acquired title through adverse possession.

Wait, but the statutory period is 20 years. So when did the 20 years end? Let's see: starting in 1987, 20 years would end in 2007. But the man left in 1997, so he only had 10 years by then. He came back in 1999, so from 1999 to 2007 is 8 years. That's only 18 years total (10 + 8). So in 2007, he hasn't met the 20 years yet, and the farmer sues in 2010.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The man starts in 1987. Possession is until 1997: 10 years. Then leaves for a year. Returns in 1999. So from 1999 to 2010 is 11 years. So total time is 10 + 11 = 21 years. But the issue is whether the one-year gap breaks the continuity.

If the man's possession was interrupted, then the time before and after can't be added together. So he only had 10 years, then after the interruption, he starts anew. So from 1999 to 2010 is 11 years, but as of 2010, he's only been there 11 years. The statutory period is 20, so he hasn't met it yet.

Wait, but the man's total possession time (including the gap) is 21 years. But if the possession must be continuous, then the gap breaks it. So the first period is 10 years, then another 11, but they're not continuous. So he hasn't met the 20-year requirement.

Therefore, the man hasn't acquired title through adverse possession. So the farmer would win because the man hasn't fulfilled the 20-year requirement due to the interruption.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option F: the farmer would win because the man had left the property for a year. That seems correct because the man's possession wasn't continuous.

Option G: the farmer would win because the man's possession was not continuous. That also seems correct, but perhaps F is more specific about the reason.

Wait, the options are:

F: the farmer would win, because the man had left the property for a year.

G: the farmer would win, because the man's possession was not continuous.

Hmm. Both F and G are about the same issue.

Wait, but the question is about the most probable judicial determination. So the reasoning is that the man's possession wasn't continuous, hence he didn't meet the 20-year requirement.

So option G seems to address the continuity issue, which is the key point.

Alternatively, option F points out that the man left for a year, which caused the discontinuity.

So both F and G could be correct. But let me read the options again.

Option C says the farmer would lose because the man's possession was open, hostile, and continuous. But if the man's possession was interrupted, then it's not continuous. So C is incorrect.

Option D says the man fulfilled the required period. But if he didn't, D is wrong.

Option F and G are about why the farmer wins, due to the man leaving (F) or the possession not being continuous (G).

I think the better answer is G, because it directly addresses the continuity, which is a required element. The fact that he left for a year caused the discontinuity.

So the correct answer would be F or G. But let me think again.

Wait, the man was in possession from 1987 to 1997 (10 years), left for a year, then came back and stayed until 2010 (11 years). So from 1987 to 1997, that's 10 years. Then, from 1999 to 2010 is 11 years. So the total time is 21 years, but it's broken into two periods with a one-year gap.

Does the law allow tacking the periods if the same person resumes possession after an interruption? I think some jurisdictions allow it if the person resumes without the owner's permission, but others don't.

Wait, no, I think that once there's an interruption, the continuity is broken, and the time doesn't accumulate. So the man would have to have 20 continuous years without interruption.

In this case, he had 10 years, then a break, then 11. So the total is 21, but not continuous. Therefore, he hasn't met the 20-year requirement.

So the farmer would win because the man's possession wasn't continuous. That points to option G.

Alternatively, because the man left for a year, option F. But G is more about the element of continuity, which is the legal requirement.

So I think the answer is G.
</think>

The question revolves around adverse possession, which requires the possessor to meet specific elements: open, notorious, continuous, hostile, and actual possession for the statutory period of 20 years. The man took possession in 1987, stayed until 1997 (10 years), left for one year, and returned in 1999, staying until 2010 (11 years). The key issue is whether the one-year absence interrupts the continuity of possession.

For adverse possession, continuity is a critical requirement. If the man's possession was interrupted, the time periods before and after the interruption cannot be combined to meet the statutory period. Here, the man's possession was broken by a one-year absence, meaning his total possession time does not meet the 20-year continuous requirement. As of 2010, he had only accumulated 11 years of possession since his return in 1999, which is insufficient to establish adverse possession.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option G** correctly identifies that the farmer would win because the man's possession was not continuous, directly addressing the legal requirement for adverse possession.
- **Option F** also points to the man leaving for a year, which caused the discontinuity, but it is less precise about the legal element of continuity.

The most accurate answer is **Option G**, as it directly addresses the failure to meet the continuity requirement, a fundamental element of adverse possession.

Answer: G
