Okay, so I've got this integral to solve: the integral from -3 to 1 of (7x² + x + 1) dx. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on calculus, but I think I can figure this out. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that integrating a function over an interval gives the area under the curve within that interval. And for polynomials like this one, each term can be integrated separately. So I should probably split this into three separate integrals.

So, the integral of 7x² dx plus the integral of x dx plus the integral of 1 dx, all evaluated from -3 to 1. That sounds manageable.

Let's start with the first term: the integral of 7x². I think the general rule for integrating x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1). So for x², n is 2, so it becomes (x³)/3. But wait, there's a coefficient of 7 here. So the integral of 7x² should be 7*(x³/3), which is (7/3)x³.

Next, the integral of x. Using the same power rule, the integral of x is (x²)/2. That's straightforward.

Then, the integral of 1 with respect to x. I think that's just x, because the integral of 1 dx is x. So putting it all together, the indefinite integral (antiderivative) of the function would be (7/3)x³ + (1/2)x² + x + C, where C is the constant of integration. But since we're calculating a definite integral from -3 to 1, the constants will cancel out, so I can ignore C for now.

Now, I need to evaluate this antiderivative at the upper limit (1) and the lower limit (-3), then subtract the lower evaluation from the upper.

Let me calculate each term at x=1 first. 

For (7/3)x³ at x=1: 7/3 * (1)^3 = 7/3.

For (1/2)x² at x=1: 1/2 * (1)^2 = 1/2.

For x at x=1: just 1.

Adding those up: 7/3 + 1/2 + 1. Let me convert them to fractions with a common denominator. 7/3 is about 2.333, 1/2 is 0.5, and 1 is 1. So together that would be 2.333 + 0.5 + 1 = 3.833, but let me do it more accurately.

Wait, let me use exact fractions. 7/3 is 14/6, 1/2 is 3/6, and 1 is 6/6. So adding them: 14/6 + 3/6 + 6/6 = (14+3+6)/6 = 23/6. Okay, that's the value at x=1.

Now for x=-3. Let's compute each term:

(7/3)x³: x is -3, so (-3)^3 is -27. Multiply by 7/3: (7/3)*(-27) = 7*(-9) = -63.

(1/2)x²: x is -3, x² is 9. So 1/2 *9 is 4.5 or 9/2.

x term: just x, which is -3.

So adding them: -63 + 9/2 + (-3). Let's compute this step by step. 

First, -63 plus (-3) is -66. Then, adding 9/2 (which is 4.5) to that: -66 + 4.5 = -61.5. Alternatively, as fractions: 9/2 is 4.5, which is 9/2. So in fractions, -66 is -132/2, so -132/2 +9/2 = (-132 +9)/2 = (-123)/2. Hmm, wait, that gives me -61.5, which is correct.

So the antiderivative at x=1 is 23/6 and at x=-3 is -123/2. Now, subtract the lower limit from the upper limit.

So the definite integral is [23/6] - [(-123/2)].

Wait, subtracting a negative is adding a positive. So it's 23/6 + 123/2.

To compute this, better to have a common denominator. 6 and 2 have a common denominator of 6.

23/6 stays as it is. 123/2 becomes (123 *3)/(2*3) = 369/6.

So adding 23/6 + 369/6 = (23 + 369)/6 = 392/6.

Simplify 392/6. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 2: 196/3.

196 divided by 3 is approximately 65.333... So 65.333.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount.

Wait, when I evaluated at x=-3:

(7/3)(-3)^3 = (7/3)*(-27) = -63. Correct.

(1/2)(-3)^2 = (1/2)(9) = 4.5. Correct.

x is -3. So adding those: -63 +4.5 -3 = (-63-3) +4.5 = -66 +4.5 = -61.5. Which is -123/2. Correct.

At x=1: (7/3)(1)^3 =7/3, (1/2)(1)^2=1/2, x=1. So 7/3 +1/2 +1.

Compute 7/3 + 1/2 = (14 +3)/6 = 17/6. Then +1 (6/6) gives 23/6. Correct.

So 23/6 - (-123/2) = 23/6 + 123/2.

Convert 123/2 to sixths: (123 *3)/(2*3)=369/6. So 23 + 369 = 392. 392/6 = 65.333...

Looking at the options, option H is 65.333. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me compute 392 divided by 6 again. 6*65=390, so 392-390=2. So 65 and 2/6, which is 65.333... Correct.

So the integral evaluates to 65.333, which is option H.

To solve the definite integral \(\int_{-3}^1 (7x^2 + x + 1) \, dx\), we first find the antiderivative of the function. Breaking the integral into three separate terms:

1. The integral of \(7x^2\) is \(\frac{7}{3}x^3\).
2. The integral of \(x\) is \(\frac{1}{2}x^2\).
3. The integral of \(1\) is \(x\).

Thus, the antiderivative of the function is:

\[
F(x) = \frac{7}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + x
\]

Next, we evaluate \(F(x)\) at the upper limit (\(x = 1\)) and the lower limit (\(x = -3\)):

- At \(x = 1\):
  \[
  F(1) = \frac{7}{3}(1)^3 + \frac{1}{2}(1)^2 + 1 = \frac{7}{3} + \frac{1}{2} + 1 = \frac{14}{6} + \frac{3}{6} + \frac{6}{6} = \frac{23}{6}
  \]

- At \(x = -3\):
  \[
  F(-3) = \frac{7}{3}(-3)^3 + \frac{1}{2}(-3)^2 + (-3) = \frac{7}{3}(-27) + \frac{1}{2}(9) - 3 = -63 + 4.5 - 3 = -61.5 = -\frac{123}{2}
  \]

The definite integral is then:

\[
\int_{-3}^1 (7x^2 + x + 1) \, dx = F(1) - F(-3) = \frac{23}{6} - \left(-\frac{123}{2}\right) = \frac{23}{6} + \frac{123}{2}
\]

To add these fractions, convert them to a common denominator of 6:

\[
\frac{23}{6} + \frac{123}{2} = \frac{23}{6} + \frac{369}{6} = \frac{392}{6} = 65.333
\]

Thus, the value of the integral is \(65.333\), which corresponds to option **H**.
