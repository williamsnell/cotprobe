Okay, so I have this economics question here about inflation types and government actions. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that the government is fighting inflation by not allowing labor unions to have wage increases. Hmm, I remember that inflation can be caused by different factors, so I need to figure out which type this policy is targeting.

So, the options are A to J, each a different type of inflation. I'm a bit rusty on all these terms, but I'll try to recall.

First, I think about what causes each type. Demand-pull inflation is when overall demand exceeds supply, driving up prices. Cost-push is when production costs increase, like wages or materials, leading to higher prices. Built-in inflation might be related to expectations, like people expecting inflation so they demand higher wages. Wage inflation specifically could be a subset of cost-push, I guess.

The government is stopping wage increases. So, they're probably trying to prevent one of the cost factors from rising. If wages can't go up, companies can't pass on higher labor costs to consumers through higher prices. That makes me think this is targeting cost-push inflation because it's about the costs (wages) pushing prices up.

Wait, but could it be wage inflation? Wage inflation is when wages themselves are rising, causing prices to go up. If the government stops wage increases, they're preventing wage inflation. But wage inflation is a specific case of cost-push. So the policy is aimed at stopping wage-driven inflation, which is a form of cost-push.

Alternatively, demand-pull is more about aggregate demand, like too much money chasing goods. So policies for that might involve reducing demand, not directly capping wages.

So the question is whether the answer is I (cost-push) or H (wage inflation). I think cost-push is broader and includes wage increases as a factor. So by preventing wage hikes, the government is addressing cost-push inflation.

Wait, but sometimes wage inflation is considered a separate category. Let me think. Cost-push is when input costs (like wages) rise and cause inflation. So if you stop wage increases, you're preventing that specific cost-push factor. So the policy is aimed at cost-push inflation, which is option I.

So the answer should be I: cost-push inflation.

The government's decision to prevent labor unions from seeking wage increases is aimed at addressing inflation caused by rising production costs, specifically wages. This type of inflation is known as cost-push inflation, where factors such as increased labor costs push up prices. By capping wage growth, the policy targets this specific driver of inflation rather than other forms like demand-pull or wage inflation alone.

Answer: I
