Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Read the the following petition to answer questions.
The Scribbling-Machines have thrown thousands of your petitioners out of employ, whereby they are brought into great distress, and are not able to procure a maintenance for their families, and deprived them of the opportunity of bringing up their children to labour. … The number of Scribbling-Machines extending about seventeen miles south-west of Leeds exceed all belief, being no less than one hundred and seventy! And as each machine will do as much work in twelve hours, as ten men can in that time do by hand, … [And, as the machines do] as much work in one day as would otherwise employ twenty men, … [a] full four thousand men are left to shift for a living how they can, and must of course fall to the Parish, if not timely relieved. … How are those men, thus thrown out of employ to provide for their families; and what are they to put their children apprentice to, that the rising generation may have something to keep them at work, in order that they may not be like vagabonds strolling about in idleness? … Many more evils we could enumerate, but we would hope, that the sensible part of mankind, who are not biased by interest, must see the dreadful tendency of their continuance; a depopulation must be the consequence; trade being then lost, the landed interest will have no other satisfaction but that of being last devoured.

Answer:

Okay, I need to answer this multiple-choice question based on the provided petition. Let me first read and understand the question and the document carefully.

The question is asking what the Leeds Woolen Workers Petition from 1786 can be used as evidence for, with options from A to G.

Looking at the petition, it's clear that the workers are upset about Scribbling-Machines. They mention that these machines have thrown thousands out of employment, causing distress and inability to maintain their families. Each machine can do the work of ten men in twelve hours, leading to about four thousand men losing their jobs. They express concerns about their children's future and the broader impact on trade and the economy, fearing depopulation and loss of trade which would harm the landed interest.

Now, let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: The rise of the Luddite movement in Britain in the eighteenth century. Wait, I thought the Luddite movement was a bit later, like early 19th century (1811-1816). So if this petition is from 1786, it's before the Luddites. So A might not be correct.

Option B: The decline of the British economy in the eighteenth century. The petition talks about unemployment and potential economic issues, but I don't think it's about the overall economy declining. It's more about specific industries affected by machinery, not the whole economy. So B might not be the best fit.

Option C: The protest against child labor. The document doesn't mention child labor directly. It's more about adults losing jobs and worrying about their children's apprenticeships. So C doesn't seem right.

Option D: The rise of trade unions. The petition is a group of workers protesting together, which is a form of collective action. However, I'm not sure if this is evidence of the rise of formal trade unions. The modern trade union movement also came a bit later, so D might not be accurate.

Option E: Spread of revolutionary ideas. The petition does express strong concerns but doesn't indicate revolutionary ideas like overthrowing the government. They're appealing for relief, so E might not fit.

Option F: Increase in child labor. The petition doesn't talk about child labor increasing. It's worried about children not having work because of the machines. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: Replacing traditional laborers with machines in industrialization. This seems spot on. The document is all about how machines (Scribbling-Machines) are replacing workers, leading to unemployment. It directly relates to the process of industrialization where machinery replaces human labor.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be G. It's about the impact of machinery during the industrial revolution replacing traditional workers.

The Leeds Woolen Workers Petition from 1786 describes the displacement of workers due to the introduction of Scribbling-Machines, highlighting the replacement of traditional laborers by machinery during the industrialization process. This aligns with option G.
