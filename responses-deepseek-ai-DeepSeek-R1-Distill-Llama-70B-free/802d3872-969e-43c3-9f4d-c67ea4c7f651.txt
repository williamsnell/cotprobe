Question:

An avid baseball fan learned that a local professional baseball club was conducting a baseball camp for fans who wanted to meet and receive instruction from the club's players. The cost of the two-week camp was advertised for $2,500, which included meals and housing. The fan, a 54-year-old salesman, forwarded the club a $50 registration deposit, which reserved him a spot in the baseball camp. Thereafter, the fan received a contract from the club, which all baseball camp attendees were required to sign. The agreement provided that the $2,500 entrance fee was nonrefundable. According to the agreement, all attendees would receive group instruction during the baseball camp. Consequently, the club's operating costs would not be reduced if one or more of the attendees failed to participate or complete the two-week program. The fan signed the contract and forwarded it with his $2,500 entrance fee to the club. Two days before the start of the baseball camp, however, the fan died from a heart attack. In a restitutionary action, can the executor of the fan's estate, a surviving brother, recover on behalf of the estate either all or part of the $2,500 paid to the club?

Options:

A: Yes, because the club did not incur any cost related to the fan's participation.
B: Yes, under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.
C: No, because the club had already invested in resources for the camp.
D: No, because the fan knew the risks when he signed the contract.
E: No, because the fan's death was not the club's responsibility.
F: No, because under the terms of the agreement the $2,500 entrance fee was nonrefundable.
G: No, but only if the club can show that before the start of the baseball camp it rejected another applicant because of its commitment to the fan.
H: Yes, if the club can fill the spot with another attendee.
I: Yes, because the club would otherwise be unjustly enriched at the fan's expense.
J: Yes, because the fan didn't receive the service he paid for.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically regarding restitution when someone dies before receiving the services they paid for. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a baseball fan who signed up for a two-week camp that cost $2,500, which included meals and housing. He paid a $50 deposit and then the full $2,500 after signing a contract that said the fee was non-refundable. The contract also mentioned that attendees would get group instruction, and the club's costs wouldn't decrease if someone didn't participate because they were already committed. Then, two days before the camp started, the fan died, and now his estate is trying to get the money back.

The question is whether the executor can recover any part of the $2,500. The options are A through J, each giving a different reason.

First, I remember that when a service is paid for but the person dies before receiving it, it's a question of whether the contract can be enforced posthumously and if restitution is possible. Restitution usually involves getting back money paid when the other party didn't fulfill their part of the contract.

The contract here says the fee is non-refundable. So the club is keeping the money no matter what. But contracts can sometimes be unenforceable if they're found to be unfair or if certain legal doctrines apply.

One of the options mentions frustration of purpose. Frustration of purpose is when an unforeseen event undermines the purpose of the contract, making it impossible to fulfill. Here, the fan's death makes it impossible for him to attend the camp, which was the purpose of the contract. But I'm not sure if that applies here because the camp is group instruction, and the club's costs don't decrease if he doesn't attend. So the main purpose was for the fan to participate, which he can't now.

Another angle is unjust enrichment. If the club keeps the money but doesn't have to provide the service, they might be unjustly enriched. But the contract says it's non-refundable, so maybe they're allowed to keep it unless the law says otherwise.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because the club didn't incur costs related to the fan's participation. But earlier it says the club's costs wouldn't be reduced because they're already committed. So maybe the club didn't save any money by him not attending, which would mean they can keep the fee.

Option B is about frustration of purpose. I'm not too sure, but I think frustration of purpose would allow the estate to get the money back because the purpose (the fan attending) was frustrated by his death. But the club's costs didn't go down, so maybe that's not applicable.

Option C says no because the club invested resources. But the contract states their costs wouldn't be reduced, so maybe this isn't the right reason.

Option D says the fan knew the risks, which is more about assumption of risk, but that's more for torts, not contracts. Not sure it applies here.

Option E says it's not the club's responsibility. That's more of a liability issue, but the question is about contract and restitution.

Option F says no because the contract says it's non-refundable. That seems straightforward, but contracts can sometimes be avoided on certain grounds.

Option G says no unless the club can show they turned down others because of him. This relates to whether the club can prove they lost other customers by reserving his spot. If they can, then they might have a legitimate claim to keep the money, but if not, maybe not. But the question doesn't mention anything about other applicants, so I'm not sure.

Option H says yes if they can fill the spot. So if they can find another attendee, maybe the estate can get a refund. But the contract didn't specify that, so it's unclear.

Option I says yes because of unjust enrichment. If the club keeps the money without providing the service, that's enrichment at the expense of the fan. Even if the contract says non-refundable, maybe the court would find it unfair to keep the money when the service wasn't rendered, especially due to death.

Option J says yes because he didn't receive the service. That makes sense, but the contract says it's non-refundable, so the club might argue they're entitled to keep it regardless.

In contract law, a non-refundable fee is generally enforceable unless there's a legal reason to set it aside. But when someone dies, courts might look more closely. The key here is that the contract says the club's costs don't decrease if someone doesn't attend, so they aren't out any money by the fan's death. Therefore, keeping the $2,500 would be a windfall, leading to unjust enrichment.

So the correct answer might be I: Yes, because the club would otherwise be unjustly enriched at the fan's expense.

Alternatively, option F says the fee is non-refundable, so maybe the answer is F. But I think the non-refundable clause might not hold if it leads to unjust enrichment without any loss to the club.

I think the correct answer is I.

The question revolves around whether the estate of a deceased baseball fan can recover a $2,500 payment for a baseball camp that the fan did not attend due to his death. The contract explicitly stated that the fee was non-refundable, and the club's operating costs would not decrease if an attendee failed to participate. The analysis considers several legal doctrines, including frustration of purpose, unjust enrichment, and the enforceability of non-refundable fees.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. While the club did not incur additional costs due to the fan's absence, the contract's terms and the non-refundable nature of the fee make this reasoning insufficient.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Frustration of purpose could apply if the purpose of the contract was entirely defeated, but the club's costs remained unchanged, undermining this argument.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The club's investment in resources does not justify retaining the fee, as their costs were not reduced by the fan's absence.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The fan's awareness of risks is irrelevant to the contractual obligation and the non-refundable clause.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The issue is not about the club's responsibility for the fan's death but rather about the enforceability of the contract and restitution.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. While the contract states the fee is non-refundable, courts may set aside such terms if they result in unjust enrichment.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The question does not provide evidence that the club rejected other applicants, making this reasoning speculative.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The ability to fill the spot is not addressed in the contract or the facts provided.
- **Option I**: Correct. The club would be unjustly enriched if it retains the $2,500 without providing the service, especially since their costs were not affected by the fan's absence.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. While the fan did not receive the service, the non-refundable clause complicates this argument unless unjust enrichment is considered.

The most compelling argument is that retaining the fee would result in unjust enrichment, as the club neither provided the service nor incurred additional costs due to the fan's absence. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I: Yes, because the club would otherwise be unjustly enriched at the fan's expense.
