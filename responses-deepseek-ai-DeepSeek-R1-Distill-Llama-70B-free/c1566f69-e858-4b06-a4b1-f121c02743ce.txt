Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I need to determine the standard heat for the reaction at 500°C. The reaction is 3H2 + N2 → 2NH3. The given ΔH_reaction at 25°C is -22.08 kcal. Oh wait, I think the question is asking for the standard enthalpy change at 500°C, not 25°C. So I need to calculate ΔH at 500°C using the provided data.

Looking at the data, I see there are values for α, β, γ for NH3, N2, and H2. Hmm, I remember that the heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) can be expressed using these coefficients. The general formula is Cp = α + β*T + γ*T², but wait, wait—what's the exact form here? Oh right, it's usually Cp = a + b*T + c*T², but sometimes the units might vary. I should check how these are presented.

Wait, in the data table, each substance has three values: α, β, γ. So probably Cp is calculated as α + β*T + γ*T². But wait, the units here—oh, the problem says "using the following data", which I assume are for the heat capacities as a function of temperature.

So the approach is to calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) from 25°C to 500°C for each substance involved in the reaction and then use that to find the ΔH at 500°C.

The reaction is 3H2 + N2 → 2NH3. At 25°C, ΔH is -22.08 kcal. So the standard enthalpy change at 500°C (ΔH_rxn^500) can be found using:

ΔH_rxn^500 = ΔH_rxn^25 + [ΔH_products (from 25 to 500) - ΔH_reactants (from 25 to 500)]

Wait, no, more accurately, the enthalpy change of the reaction at T2 is equal to the enthalpy change at T1 plus the integral of ΔCp with respect to T from T1 to T2, multiplied by the number of moles and the heat capacities.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the standard enthalpy change as a function of temperature. The formula I remember is:

ΔH°(T2) = ΔH°(T1) + ∫(T1 to T2) ΔCp dT

Where ΔCp is the heat capacity change of the reaction, which is [sum Cp(products) - sum Cp(reactants)].

So first, I'll calculate ΔCp for the reaction. Let's write down the Cp expressions for each substance.

For NH3:
Cp = 6.086 + 8.812e-3 * T - 1.506e-6 * T²

For N2:
Cp = 6.524 + 1.250e-3 * T - 1e-6 * T²

Wait, wait. Let me look again. The data shows for NH3: α=6.086, β=8.812e-3, γ=-1.506e-6. So Cp for NH3 is 6.086 + 8.812e-3*T + (-1.506e-6)*T².

Similarly, N2: 6.524 + 1.250e-3*T + (-0.001e-6)*T². Wait, 0.001e-6 is 1e-9. So N2's Cp is 6.524 + 0.00125*T - 1e-9*T².

H2: 6.947 + 0.2e-3*T + 0.481e-6*T². So that's 6.947 + 0.0002*T + 0.000000481*T².

Now, the reaction is 3H2 + N2 → 2NH3. So the moles for each are:

Reactants: 3 moles H2, 1 mole N2.
Products: 2 moles NH3.

So the ΔCp for the reaction is [2*(NH3 Cp) - (3*H2 Cp + 1*N2 Cp)].

So let's compute ΔCp as:

ΔCp = 2*(6.086 + 8.812e-3*T -1.506e-6*T²) - [3*(6.947 +0.0002*T +0.481e-6*T²) + (6.524 +0.00125*T -1e-9*T²)]

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, calculate 2*NH3 Cp:
2 * 6.086 = 12.172
2 * 8.812e-3 = 0.017624
2 * (-1.506e-6) = -3.012e-6
So 2NH3 Cp = 12.172 + 0.017624 T - 3.012e-6 T²

Next, the reactants: 3H2 + N2.

3H2 Cp:
3 *6.947 = 20.841
3 *0.0002 = 0.0006
3 *0.481e-6 = 1.443e-6
So 3H2 Cp = 20.841 +0.0006 T +1.443e-6 T²

N2 Cp: 6.524 +0.00125 T -1e-9 T²

Adding 3H2 and N2 Cp:
20.841 +6.524 = 27.365
0.0006 T + 0.00125 T = 0.00185 T
1.443e-6 T² + (-1e-9) T² = approx 1.442e-6 T² (since 1e-9 is negligible compared to 1.443e-6)

So total reactants Cp = 27.365 + 0.00185 T + 1.442e-6 T²

So ΔCp = [12.172 +0.017624 T -3.012e-6 T²] - [27.365 + 0.00185 T +1.442e-6 T²]

Calculate term by term:

Constants: 12.172 -27.365 = -15.193
T terms: 0.017624 T - 0.00185 T = 0.015774 T
T² terms: (-3.012e-6) - (1.442e-6) = -4.454e-6 T²

So ΔCp = -15.193 + 0.015774 T - 4.454e-6 T²

Now, the integral of ΔCp from T1 to T2 (where T is in °C, but wait, when integrating for enthalpy, should T be in Kelvin? Hmmm. Because heat capacity is usually expressed in terms of Kelvin. Oh wait, but for the integral, the difference would be small. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses T in Kelvin, but since the change is from 25°C to 500°C, which is 298 K to 773 K. But wait, the heat capacity is given as a function of temperature in Celsius? Or is T in the equation in Kelvin? Hmm, I think I'm supposed to use T in the same units as given. Wait, in the data table, the Cp is given with T probably in Celsius because the reaction is at 25°C. So perhaps the T is in Celsius. But in thermodynamics, the equations usually use absolute temperature (Kelvin). Hmm, this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use T in Kelvin but the coefficients are for T in Celsius. Wait, that's getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to convert the temperatures to Kelvin. Because when integrating, the enthalpy change depends on the integral over temperature in Kelvin. So, T1 is 25°C = 298 K, T2 is 500°C = 773 K.

But then, the Cp expression uses T in Celsius. So, for example, when T is 500°C, which is 773 K, but in the Cp expressions, T is 500. That's a problem because the units don't match. Hmm. This might be a point of confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the heat capacity is expressed as a function of T in Celsius. But I think in reality, heat capacities are expressed as functions of absolute temperature. So perhaps the correct approach is to convert the temperature values to Kelvin when plugging into the Cp expressions.

Wait, but the coefficients α, β, γ are given for T in Celsius. So if T is in Kelvin, the values would be way off. Hmm, that complicates things. Maybe the problem expects us to use T in Celsius in the Cp expressions, even though that's technically incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the units are consistent, and we can proceed with T in Celsius.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to proceed with T in Celsius for the calculation. Let's proceed that way, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's data is given with T in Kelvin. Let me think. The problem says the data is given as α, β, γ, but doesn't specify the units for T. That's a bit ambiguous. But perhaps the standard is to use T in Kelvin for such expressions. So I'll proceed by converting the temperature to Kelvin when evaluating the integrals.

So, the reaction is at 25°C (298 K) and 500°C (773 K). So T1=298, T2=773.

So, to compute the integral of ΔCp from T1 to T2, which will give us the change in enthalpy for the reaction when going from 25°C to 500°C.

But wait, ΔCp is in cal/(mol·°C) or cal/(mol·K)? Because the units matter for the integral. Hmm. Also, the ΔH_reaction is given in kcal, so I need to be careful with the units.

Wait, the original ΔH_reaction is -22.08 kcal. So that's -22080 cal (since 1 kcal = 1000 cal). So I need to convert that as well.

Wait, but let's get back to the integral. The integral of ΔCp dT from T1 to T2 gives the change in enthalpy for the reaction over that temperature range.

So, ΔH_rxn^500 = ΔH_rxn^25 + ∫(T1 to T2) ΔCp dT

But wait, the units of ΔCp need to be in cal/(mol·K) to make the units work out when integrating dT in Kelvin. Because when you integrate cal/(mol·K) * dT (in K), you get cal/mol.

But wait, the ΔCp is per mole of reaction, right? So for each mole of reaction as written, the ΔCp is as calculated.

Wait, let's be precise. The ΔCp is per mole of reaction. So when you multiply by the temperature change, you get the enthalpy change per mole of reaction.

But wait, the issue is that ΔCp is expressed as a function of T, so the integral is from T1 to T2 of [ΔCp(T)] dT.

So, first, let's compute the integral of ΔCp from T1=298 K to T2=773 K.

But wait, ΔCp is a function of T in the expression we derived, but if the problem expects T in Celsius, then when T is in Kelvin, the value would be wrong. So perhaps the problem expects us to use T in Celsius in the expression for ΔCp. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's Cp is expressed with T in Celsius. So, perhaps I should proceed with T in Celsius.

So T1 is 25°C and T2 is 500°C. So the integral is from 25 to 500 of ΔCp(T°C) dT.

But then, the issue is that the units for the integral would be in cal/(mol·°C) * °C = cal/mol. So that would be correct.

Thus, perhaps the problem expects us to use T in Celsius for the calculation.

So, let me proceed with T in Celsius.

So, ΔCp(T) = -15.193 + 0.015774 T - 4.454e-6 T²

Now, the integral of ΔCp from 25°C to 500°C is:

Integral = ∫ [ -15.193 + 0.015774 T - 4.454e-6 T² ] dT from 25 to 500.

Let's compute this integral step by step.

First, find the antiderivative:

∫ ΔCp dT = -15.193 T + (0.015774/2) T² - (4.454e-6 /3) T³ + C

Simplify:

= -15.193 T + 0.007887 T² - 1.484e-6 T³

Now, evaluate this from T=25 to T=500.

Compute at T=500:

First term: -15.193 *500 = -7596.5
Second term: 0.007887*(500)^2 = 0.007887 * 250000 = 1972.25
Third term: -1.484e-6*(500)^3 = -1.484e-6 * 125,000,000 = -185.5

So sum at T=500: -7596.5 + 1972.25 -185.5 = (-7596.5 -185.5) + 1972.25 = (-7782) + 1972.25 = -5809.75

Now compute at T=25:

First term: -15.193 *25 = -379.825
Second term: 0.007887*(25)^2 = 0.007887 *625 = approx 4.929375
Third term: -1.484e-6*(25)^3 = -1.484e-6 * 15625 = approx -0.0232

Sum at T=25: -379.825 +4.929375 -0.0232 ≈ (-379.825 -0.0232) +4.929375 ≈ -379.8482 +4.929375 ≈ -374.9188

Now, the integral from 25 to 500 is [value at 500] - [value at 25] = (-5809.75) - (-374.9188) = -5809.75 +374.9188 ≈ -5434.83 cal/mol

Wait, wait, but let me double-check the calculations because it's easy to make arithmetic errors.

Let me recompute each part.

At T=500:

-15.193 *500 = 15.193 *500 is 7596.5, so negative is -7596.5

0.007887 *500^2 = 0.007887 *250000 = 1972.25

-1.484e-6 *500^3 = 500^3 is 125e6, so 1.484e-6 *125e6 = 185.5 → so negative is -185.5

Sum: (-7596.5) + 1972.25 = (-5624.25) → -5624.25 -185.5 = -5809.75

At T=25:

-15.193 *25 = let's calculate 15 *25=375, 0.193*25=4.825 → 375+4.825=379.825 → negative is -379.825

0.007887 *25^2 = 25^2=625 → 0.007887 *625 ≈ 4.929375

-1.484e-6 *25^3 → 25^3=15625 → 1.484e-6 *15625 = approx 0.0232 → negative is -0.0232

Sum: (-379.825) +4.929375 = (-374.895625) → then minus 0.0232 → -374.918825

So the integral is (-5809.75) - (-374.9188) = -5809.75 +374.9188 ≈ -5434.83 cal/mol

Wait, but wait: The result is in cal per mole of reaction as written, right? Because ΔCp is per mole reaction, so the integral will give the change in enthalpy per mole reaction.

So now, adding this to the ΔH at 25°C to get ΔH at 500°C.

ΔH_rxn^500 = ΔH_rxn^25 + ∫ΔCp dT from 25 to 500.

But wait, ΔH_reaction at 25°C is given as -22.08 kcal. So that's -22080 cal.

So ΔH_rxn^500 = (-22080 cal) + (-5434.83 cal) = -27514.83 cal.

Looking at the options:

Options are in cal, I think. Wait, option I is -22,080 cal, which is the same as the 25°C value. So the correct value at 500°C is lower (more negative) than at 25°C.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 22,500 cal
B: -25,570 cal
C: 18,000 cal
D: -18,267 cal
E: -19,500 cal
F: 15.193 cal
G: -20,000 cal
H: -30,000 cal
I: -22,080 cal
J: -17,500 cal

So my calculated value is approximately -27515 cal. Looking for the closest option. Option B is -25,570 cal, which is about 25570. Hmm, but my calculation is 27515, which is about -2.75e4. So none of the options exactly match this. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck the integral calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the integration steps.

ΔCp = -15.193 + 0.015774 T - 4.454e-6 T²

The integral from 25 to 500:

Antiderivative is -15.193 T + 0.015774/2 T² - (4.454e-6)/3 T^3

Which is:

-15.193 T + 0.007887 T² - 1.484e-6 T^3

At T=500:

-15.193 *500 = -7596.5

0.007887 *500^2 = 0.007887 *250000 = 1972.25
