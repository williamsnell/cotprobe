Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two events happening in different inertial reference frames. Let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that in frame S, two events occur at the same place, so they have zero spatial separation there. But they're separated by a time interval of 3 seconds. Then in another frame S', the time interval between these events is 5 seconds. The question is asking for the spatial separation in S'.

Hmm, wait, so in S, the events are at the same spot, so the distance between them is zero there. But in S', because the time is different, does that mean they're happening in different places?

I remember something about spacetime intervals and how different frames perceive events. Oh right, the spacetime interval is invariant, right? So the interval squared should be the same in all frames. The interval is calculated as (Δs)^2 = (cΔt)^2 - (Δx)^2, where c is the speed of light.

In frame S, since the events are at the same place, Δx is zero. So the interval squared is (c * 3)^2. Let me write that down: (Δs)^2 = (c * 3)^2.

Now in frame S', the time interval is 5 seconds, so Δt' is 5. Let's denote the spatial separation in S' as Δx'. Then the interval in S' would be (Δs)^2 = (c * 5)^2 - (Δx')^2.

Since the intervals are equal in both frames, I can set them equal to each other. So:

(c * 3)^2 = (c *5)^2 - (Δx')^2.

I need to solve for Δx'. Let's expand this equation. 

Expanding both sides:

c² * 9 = c² * 25 - (Δx')².

Let me rearrange this. Subtract c²*25 from both sides:

c²*9 - c²*25 = - (Δx')².

Factor out c²:

c² (9 -25) = - (Δx')².

Which simplifies to:

c² (-16) = - (Δx')².

Multiply both sides by -1:

16 c² = (Δx')².

Taking the square root of both sides:

Δx' = sqrt(16) * c = 4c.

Wait, 4 times the speed of light? Hmm, but the speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 4 * 3e8 m/s is 1.2e9 meters per second. But wait, the question is about spatial separation, which is in meters, not meters per second.

Oh wait, no, the spatial separation would be Δx' = 4c times some time factor? Wait, no, wait. Let me check the units again.

Wait, the interval equation is (Δs)^2 = (c Δt)^2 - (Δx)^2. So the units would be in meters squared, since c is m/s. So Δt is in seconds, so c*Δt is meters. Squared would be m².

So when I have 16 c² = (Δx')², the units on the right are (meters)^2. So Δx' is sqrt(16 c²) which is 4c. Wait, but that's 4c, which has units of meters per second. That can't be right for a distance.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because in the equation, (Δx')² is in meters squared. So 16 c² has units (m²/s²) * s²? No, wait, the equation is (Δs)^2 = (c Δt)^2 - (Δx)^2. So (c Δt) is (m/s * s) = meters. Squared is m². So (Δx)^2 is m². So 16 c^2 is m²/s² * s²? Wait, no, 16 c^2 is (m²/s²) * s²? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let's compute it numerically. Let me plug in the numbers. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So, 16 c² is 16 * (3e8)^2 = 16 * 9e16 = 144e16 m². So sqrt(144e16) is 12e8 m. Oh wait, so Δx' is 4c, but when I compute it numerically, it's 12e8 meters.

Wait, wait, 4c would be 4 * 3e8 = 1.2e9 meters. But according to the equation, 16 c^2 is (Δx')², so sqrt(16 c²) is 4c. So 4c is 4 * 3e8 = 1.2e9 m, which is 12e8 m.

Wait, no, 4 * 3e8 is 1.2e9, which is 12e8 m. So the spatial separation is 12e8 meters.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option E is 12e8 m. So that's option E.

But wait, wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the algebra.

We have (Δs)^2 = (c *3)^2 in S. In S', (Δs)^2 = (c *5)^2 - (Δx')^2.

Set equal: 9c² = 25c² - (Δx')².

So 9c² -25c² = - (Δx')^2 → -16c² = - (Δx')² → 16c² = (Δx')² → Δx' = 4c.

Wait, 4c is 4 * 3e8 m/s → 1.2e9 m/s, but wait, that's a velocity, not a distance. Oh wait no, Δx' is the spatial separation, which is in meters, not velocity. So 4c is the correct calculation, but wait, when you square 4c, you get (Δx')^2. So Δx' is 4c? 

Wait, no, wait: (Δx')^2 = 16 c^2. So Δx' = 4c, which is a distance. Because c is in meters per second, but since it's multiplied by 4, which is dimensionless, the units are meters.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because c has units of m/s. 4c has units of m/s, which can't be a distance. So something's wrong here.

Ah! Oh wait, I think I messed up the dimensions. Let me correct that.

Wait, the problem says Δt in S is 3 seconds, and in S', it's 5 seconds. So when I compute (Δx')^2 = (c^2)(25 -9) = 16 c^2. But wait, the units would be (m²/s²) * s²? No, because (Δx')^2 is (m)^2. Let me think again.

Wait, no: (cΔt) is in meters (because c is m/s, Δt is s → m). So (cΔt)^2 is m². So the equation is (Δs)^2 = (m)^2 - (m)^2, so units are consistent.

So (Δx')^2 = 16 c^2 → Δx' = 4 c × [Δt?], no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, is the equation (Δx')^2 = (c (5 - 3))^2? No, that's not it. Because in S, Δt is 3, and in S', Δt is 5.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using Lorentz transformations. Because the events are at the same place in S, their coordinates are (x, t) and (x, t + 3). In S', the coordinates would be (x', t') and (x' + Δx', t' +5).

Using the Lorentz transformation equations:

t' = γ (t - v x / c² )
x' = γ (x - v t )

Since in S, the two events are at the same x, let x=0 for simplicity. So for the first event, t1 = 0, x1=0. Then, the second event is at t2=3, x2=0.

So the Lorentz transformation for the first event gives t1' = γ (0 - 0) = 0, x1' = γ (0 - 0) = 0.

For the second event, t2' = γ (3 - 0) = 3 γ, x2' = γ (0 - 0 ) = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because then in S', both events would be at x'=0, separated by t'=3 γ. But in the problem, the separation in S' is 5 seconds.

Hmm, so let's set t2' - t1' =5. Since t1' is 0, t2' =5. So 3 γ =5 → γ =5/3.

Okay, so γ is 5/3. Now, what is the spatial separation in S'?

Wait, according to the Lorentz transformation, if the first event is at x=0, t=0, then in S', the first event is at x1' =0, t1'=0. The second event is at x2' = γ (0 - v *3 ), because x2=0, t2=3.

Wait, x2' = gamma*(x2 - v t2) → x2' = gamma*(0 - v *3 ) = -3 gamma v.

So the spatial separation between the two events in S' is x2' - x1' = (-3 gamma v ) - 0 = -3 gamma v. The separation is the absolute value, so 3 gamma v.

Now, gamma is 5/3. So 3 * (5/3) * v =5v. So the spatial separation is 5v meters.

But wait, what's v? Because we need to find v in terms of known quantities.

We also know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) =5/3.

So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) =5/3 → sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 3/5 → square both sides: 1 - v²/c² =9/25 → v²/c² = 1 -9/25=16/25 → v= (4/5)c.

So v= (4/5)c.

Then, the spatial separation is 5v =5*(4/5)c=4c. So 4c is 4 *3e8 m/s=1.2e9 m/s, but again, that's velocity units. Wait no, 4c is the distance? Wait, because when we compute x2' = -3 gamma v, the units are (unitless gamma) * (v in m/s) * (t in s). So 3 is in seconds, gamma is unitless, v is m/s. So 3*(m/s) gives 3v in (m/s * s)= m. So x2' is in meters, which makes sense.

So 3 gamma v =3*(5/3)* (4c/5) )= let's compute this:

3*(5/3)=5, so 5*(4c/5)=4c. So yes, x2' is 4c meters.

Wait, but 4c is 4 * 3e8 m =1.2e9 m, which is 12e8 m. So the answer would be 12e8 meters.

Looking back at the options, option E is 12 ×10^8 m. So the correct answer should be E.

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using the invariance of the spacetime interval and Lorentz transformations. In the inertial reference frame \( S \), the two events occur at the same location, so the spatial separation is \( \Delta x = 0 \), and the time interval is \( \Delta t = 3 \, \text{s} \). The spacetime interval in \( S \) is given by:

\[
(\Delta s)^2 = (c \Delta t)^2 - (\Delta x)^2 = (c \cdot 3)^2 - 0^2 = 9c^2.
\]

In the inertial reference frame \( S' \), the time interval between the two events is \( \Delta t' = 5 \, \text{s} \), and the spatial separation is \( \Delta x' \). The spacetime interval in \( S' \) is:

\[
(\Delta s)^2 = (c \Delta t')^2 - (\Delta x')^2 = (c \cdot 5)^2 - (\Delta x')^2 = 25c^2 - (\Delta x')^2.
\]

Since the spacetime interval is invariant, we equate the expressions for \( (\Delta s)^2 \) in the two frames:

\[
9c^2 = 25c^2 - (\Delta x')^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( (\Delta x')^2 \):

\[
(\Delta x')^2 = 25c^2 - 9c^2 = 16c^2.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\Delta x' = 4c.
\]

Substituting \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):

\[
\Delta x' = 4 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 = 12 \times 10^8 \, \text{m}.
\]

Thus, the spatial separation between the two events in frame \( S' \) is \( 12 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**E: \( 12 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \).**
