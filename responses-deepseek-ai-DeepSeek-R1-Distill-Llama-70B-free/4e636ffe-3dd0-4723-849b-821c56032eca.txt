Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the de Broglie wavelength of an alpha particle. Hmm, I remember the de Broglie wavelength is related to the momentum of a particle. The formula is lambda equals h over p, where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum.

Wait, the problem gives me the energy of the alpha particles as 4.8 MeV. But I need to find the momentum. Oh right, because energy and momentum are related. Since the particle is moving at a speed much less than the speed of light, I can probably use the non-relativistic equations. So the kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv², and momentum p is mv.

So I need to find the momentum from the given energy. Let me think, KE equals p²/(2m), right? Because if KE is (1/2)mv², and p is mv, then v is p/m. Substituting that into KE gives KE = p²/(2m). So rearranging, p equals sqrt(2mKE).

Alright, but wait, the units here are in ergs and grams. Let me make sure I get the conversions right. The given data says 1.0 MeV is 1.6e-6 erg. So 4.8 MeV is 4.8 times that, which is 4.8 * 1.6e-6 erg. Let me calculate that: 4.8 * 1.6 is 7.68, so that's 7.68e-6 erg.

The mass of the alpha particle is given as 6.6e-24 grams. Wait, but I remember an alpha particle is a helium nucleus, so it's about 4 times the mass of a proton, which is roughly 4*1.67e-24 grams, which would be around 6.68e-24 g. So that matches the given value.

So putting it all together, the momentum p is sqrt(2 * m * KE). Let me plug in the numbers. m is 6.6e-24 grams, KE is 7.68e-6 erg.

Wait, erg is gram cm²/s², right? So the units should work out.

Calculating the numerator inside the square root: 2 * 6.6e-24 g * 7.68e-6 erg. Let's compute that.

2 * 6.6e-24 is 1.32e-23. Multiply by 7.68e-6: 1.32e-23 * 7.68e-6 = Let's see, 1.32 *7.68 is about 10.13, and the exponents -23 -6 is -29. So approximately 10.13e-29, or 1.013e-28.

Wait, wait, 1.32 *7.68 is 10.1256, yes. So 1.013e-28 (g^2 cm²/s²) because erg is g cm²/s², so multiplying by grams gives g^2 cm²/s². Wait, no: m is in g, KE is in erg (g cm²/s²), so 2m KE would have units of (g)(g cm²/s²) )= g² cm²/s². So the square root would give units of g cm/s, which is the unit of momentum, since momentum is mass times velocity (g cm/s).

So p is sqrt(1.013e-28) g cm/s. Square root of 1e-28 is 1e-14, but let's be precise.

The square root of 1.013e-28 is sqrt(1.013) * 1e-14. The square root of 1.013 is approximately 1.0065, so p ≈ 1.0065e-14 g cm/s.

But wait, let's calculate it more accurately. 1.013e-28 is 1.013 * 10^-28. The square root is sqrt(1.013) * 10^-14. sqrt(1.013) is about 1.0065, so 1.0065e-14 g cm/s.

Now, the de Broglie wavelength is h divided by p. Planck's constant h is given as 6.6e-27 erg seconds. Oh wait, erg is g cm²/s², so h has units erg s = (g cm²/s²)*s = g cm²/s, which is correct for Planck's constant.

So lambda = h / p. Plugging in the numbers: (6.6e-27 erg s) / (1.0065e-14 g cm/s).

Erg is g cm²/s², so h has units g cm²/s. p is g cm/s. So dividing gives (g cm²/s) / (g cm/s) ) = cm. So the units are correct.

Now compute the numerical value: 6.6e-27 / 1.0065e-14.

6.6 /1.0065 is approximately 6.555... so 6.555e-13 cm.

Wait, because 6.6e-27 divided by 1e-14 is 6.6e-13, but since it's divided by 1.0065e-14, it's 6.6 / 1.0065 = about 6.555e-13 cm.

Looking at the options, let me see:

Option F: 6.6e-13 cm.

Option E:1.3e-13 cm.

Hmm, but my calculation is giving around 6.55e-13 cm, which is close to option F, 6.6e-13 cm.

Wait but did I make a mistake in the calculation earlier steps? Let me double-check.

Wait, the initial KE calculation: 4.8 MeV is 4.8 * 1.6e-6 erg. 4.8 *1.6 is 7.68, so 7.68e-6 erg. Correct.

Then 2mKE = 2 *6.6e-24 g *7.68e-6 erg.

Wait, 6.6e-24 *7.68e-6 = ?

6.6 *7.68 = let's compute: 6 *7.68 is 46.08, 0.6*7.68 is 4.608, total 50.688. So 50.688e-30 (since 10^-24 *10^-6 is 10^-30). Then multiply by 2: 101.376e-30 = 1.01376e-28. So p = sqrt(1.01376e-28) = approx 1.00688e-14 g cm/s.

So h is 6.6e-27 erg s. So lambda = 6.6e-27 / 1.00688e-14.

Calculate that: 6.6 /1.00688 is approximately 6.55, so 6.55e-13 cm.

So the closest option is F:6.6e-13 cm. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I use the correct value for h?

Wait the problem states h is 6.6e-27 erg sec. So yes, which is correct.

Alternatively, sometimes people use h-bar, but no, the de Broglie formula uses h, not h-bar.

Wait, let me make sure. The de Broglie wavelength is h/(mv), yes. So correct approach.

Another point: the alpha particle's energy is given as 4.8 MeV, which is its kinetic energy. So yes, using KE = p²/(2m) is correct.

Another check: calculating the momentum. Let me compute p again.

KE = 4.8 MeV = 4.8 *1.6e-6 erg = 7.68e-6 erg.

p = sqrt(2 m KE).

m =6.6e-24 g.

So 2m KE = 2*6.6e-24 *7.68e-6 = 1.01376e-28 erg g? Wait, no, because erg is g cm²/s². So 2 m KE has units (g)*(g cm²/s²) )= g² cm²/s². So the square root is g cm/s, which is correct for momentum.

So p is sqrt(1.01376e-28) = approx 1.0068e-14 g cm/s.

So h is 6.6e-27 erg s. Then lambda = 6.6e-27 / 1.0068e-14 = approx 6.55e-13 cm.

Looking again at the options:

Option F is 6.6e-13 cm.

So the correct answer is F.
</think>

To calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an alpha particle with an energy of 4.8 MeV, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
\]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( p \) is the momentum of the particle. The momentum can be derived from the kinetic energy (\( KE \)) using the relationship:

\[
KE = \frac{p^2}{2m} \quad \Rightarrow \quad p = \sqrt{2mKE}
\]

### Step 1: Convert the energy to ergs
The energy of the alpha particle is given as 4.8 MeV. Using the conversion \( 1.0 \, \text{MeV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{erg} \), we find:

\[
KE = 4.8 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-6} = 7.68 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{erg}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the momentum
The mass of the alpha particle is \( m = 6.6 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{g} \). Substituting into the formula for \( p \):

\[
p = \sqrt{2mKE} = \sqrt{2 \times (6.6 \times 10^{-24}) \times (7.68 \times 10^{-6})}
\]

First, calculate the product inside the square root:

\[
2 \times 6.6 \times 10^{-24} \times 7.68 \times 10^{-6} = 1.01376 \times 10^{-28}
\]

Now take the square root:

\[
p = \sqrt{1.01376 \times 10^{-28}} \approx 1.0068 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{g cm/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength
Planck's constant is given as \( h = 6.6 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{erg s} \). Using the formula for \( \lambda \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{6.6 \times 10^{-27}}{1.0068 \times 10^{-14}}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
\lambda \approx 6.55 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The closest option to \( 6.55 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm} \) is:

**F: \( 6.6 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm} \)**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**F: \( 6.6 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm} \)**
