Okay, so I've got this question about present value, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question says that there's a cash flow of $100, and it's going to be received in 5 years. The discount rate is 5%. I need to find the present value of this cash flow. The options are from A to J, each with a different number.

Hmm, I remember that present value is like the value of future money today. Because money today can earn interest, right? So a dollar in the future isn't worth as much as a dollar today. So to find the present value, I think I need to discount the future amount back to the present using the discount rate.

The formula I think is PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where FV is the future value, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of periods. Oh wait, yeah, that sounds right. So in this case, FV is 100, r is 5% or 0.05, and n is 5 years.

Let me plug in the numbers. So PV = 100 / (1 + 0.05)^5. Let me calculate the denominator first. 1 + 0.05 is 1.05. Now I need to raise that to the power of 5. I might need to calculate that step by step.

What's 1.05 to the power of 5? Let me think. I can calculate it year by year.

First year: 1.05
Second year: 1.05 * 1.05 = 1.1025
Third year: 1.1025 * 1.05. Let's see, 1 times 1.05 is 1.05, 0.1025 * 1.05 is approximately 0.107625. So adding those together, maybe around 1.157625?
Wait, wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. 1.1025 * 1.05. Let's compute 1.1025 * 1.05.

1.1025 * 1 = 1.1025
1.1025 * 0.05 = 0.055125
So adding those gives 1.157625. That's correct for the third year.

Fourth year: 1.157625 * 1.05. Let's compute that.
1 times 1.05 is 1.05, 0.157625 * 1.05.
Wait, 1.157625 * 1.05. Alternatively, I can think of it as 1.157625 + 1.157625 * 0.05.

1.157625 * 0.05 is 0.05788125. So adding to 1.157625 gives 1.21550625. So that's the fourth power.

Fifth year: 1.21550625 * 1.05. Let me compute that.
1.21550625 * 1 is 1.21550625. 1.21550625 * 0.05 is 0.0607753125. So adding them gives 1.2762815625.

Wait, but I could also use a calculator here, but since I'm just thinking, I'll go with that. So (1.05)^5 is approximately 1.2762815625.

So the denominator is about 1.2762815625. Now, the present value is 100 divided by that.

So 100 / 1.2762815625. Let me compute that. Hmm, what's 1 / 1.2762815625 approximately?

Well, 1.276 is about 1.276. Let's see, 1/1.276 is approximately 0.7835. Because 1.276 * 0.7835 is roughly 1. Let me check: 0.7835 * 1.276.

Calculating 0.7835 * 1.2 is 0.9402, and 0.7835 * 0.076 is approximately 0.0596. Adding those gives around 0.9402 + 0.0596 = 0.9998, which is almost 1. So that's a good approximation.

So 100 * 0.7835 is 78.35. So the present value is about $78.35.

Looking at the options, option A is 78.3526. That seems to match. Let me double-check my calculation. Maybe I should compute (1.05)^5 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use logarithms or exponentials. But I think my manual calculation was close enough. Alternatively, I could use the formula for compound interest.

Wait, maybe another way. 5% over 5 years. The present value factor for 5% over 5 years is 1/(1.05)^5 = 1/(1.2762815625) â‰ˆ 0.783526.

So 100 * 0.783526 is 78.3526, which is option A.

So the correct answer should be A.

To calculate the present value (PV) of a $100 cash flow received in 5 years with a discount rate of 5%, we use the formula:

\[
PV = \frac{FV}{(1 + r)^n}
\]

Where:
- \( FV = 100 \) (future value),
- \( r = 0.05 \) (discount rate),
- \( n = 5 \) (number of years).

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
(1 + 0.05)^5 = 1.05^5
\]

Breaking it down:
- \( 1.05^1 = 1.05 \),
- \( 1.05^2 = 1.1025 \),
- \( 1.05^3 = 1.157625 \),
- \( 1.05^4 = 1.21550625 \),
- \( 1.05^5 = 1.2762815625 \).

Now, divide the future value by this factor:

\[
PV = \frac{100}{1.2762815625} \approx 78.3526
\]

Thus, the present value of the cash flow is approximately **78.3526**, which corresponds to option **A**.
