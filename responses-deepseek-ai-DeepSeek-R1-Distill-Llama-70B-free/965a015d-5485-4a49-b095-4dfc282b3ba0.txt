Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question is about a newly discovered planet. The key details are that its density is twice that of Earth, and the acceleration due to gravity on its surface is the same as Earth's. I need to find the planet's radius from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of a planet is given by the formula g = (G*M)/(R²), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and R is its radius. Also, density (d) is mass divided by volume, which for a sphere is (M)/( (4/3)πR³ ). So, maybe I can relate these two.

Let me write down the knowns:
- The planet's density (d_p) is twice Earth's (d_e): d_p = 2 * d_e.
- The gravity on the planet's surface (g_p) is equal to Earth's (g_e): g_p = g_e.

I need to find R_p, the radius of the planet, using these relationships.

First, express the mass of the planet in terms of density and volume. So for Earth, M_e = d_e * (4/3)π R_e³. Similarly, M_p = d_p * (4/3)π R_p³.

Since d_p is 2d_e, substituting that in, M_p = 2d_e * (4/3)π R_p³.

Now, the gravitational acceleration on the planet's surface is g_p = (G * M_p) / R_p². But since g_p equals g_e, I can set them equal.

So, (G * M_p) / R_p² = (G * M_e) / R_e².

Wait, but G is the same in both cases, so I can cancel G out. So:

M_p / R_p² = M_e / R_e².

Substituting M_p from earlier:

(2d_e * (4/3)π R_p³) / R_p² = (d_e * (4/3)π R_e³) / R_e².

Simplify the left side: 2d_e * (4/3)π R_p³ / R_p² = 2d_e * (4/3)π R_p.

Right side: d_e * (4/3)π R_e³ / R_e² = d_e * (4/3)π R_e.

So now the equation is:

2d_e * (4/3)π R_p = d_e * (4/3)π R_e.

Hmm, I can cancel out terms here. Both sides have (4/3)π. Also, d_e is on both sides, so they cancel as well. So:

2 R_p = R_e.

Wait, that would imply R_p = R_e / 2. That can't be right because if the planet has higher density, the same gravity would mean a smaller radius. But wait, let me double-check my steps.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in substituting. Let me go back.

The initial equation after substituting M_p and M_e:

(2d_e * (4/3 π R_p³) ) / R_p² = (d_e * (4/3 π R_e³)) ) / R_e².

Simplify numerator on left: 2d_e * (4/3 π) R_p³.

Denominator: R_p². So overall, 2d_e (4/3 π) R_p³ / R_p² = 2d_e (4/3 π) R_p.

Right side: numerator d_e (4/3 π) R_e³, denominator R_e² → d_e (4/3 π) R_e.

So equation becomes 2d_e (4/3 π) R_p = d_e (4/3 π) R_e.

I can divide both sides by d_e (4/3 π), which gives 2 R_p = R_e → R_p = R_e / 2.

Wait, that's what I got earlier. But this suggests the planet's radius is half of Earth's. But let me think, if the density is higher, same gravity would require a smaller radius. But let me check Earth's radius to see what the options say.

Wait, Earth's radius is about 6.37 ×10^6 meters, right? So half would be about 3.18e6 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 3.19e6, which is very close.

But wait, wait a second. Let me verify my approach again because sometimes when dealing with gravity and density, there's another approach.

Alternatively, I remember that g = G*(density * volume) / R². Since volume is (4/3 π R³), so substituting, g = G*(d * (4/3 π R³)) / R² → g = (4/3 G π d R ) / 3? Wait, let me make it correctly.

g = G * (M) / R². And M is density * volume → M = d * (4/3 π R^3). So g = G * d * (4/3 π R^3) / R² = G * d * (4/3 π R) → g = (4/3) G π d R.

Hmm, so g is proportional to density times radius. So, g_p = g_e → (4/3 G π d_p R_p) ) = (4/3 G π d_e R_e).

Cancel out the constants, so d_p R_p = d_e R_e.

Given that d_p = 2 d_e → 2 d_e R_p = d_e R_e → R_p = R_e / 2.

So that's consistent with what I found earlier. So R_p is half of Earth's radius. Earth's radius is approx 6.38e6 m, so half is 3.19e6 m. So option B.

Looking at the options, option B is 3.19 ×1e6 meters, which matches. So the answer should be B.

To determine the radius of the newly discovered planet, we start by using the relationship between gravitational acceleration, mass, and radius. The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of a planet is given by:

\[
g = \frac{G M}{R^2}
\]

where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is the mass of the planet, and \( R \) is its radius. Additionally, the mass of a planet can be expressed in terms of its density (\( d \)) and volume (\( V \)):

\[
M = d \cdot V = d \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3
\]

Substituting this into the gravity equation:

\[
g = \frac{G \cdot d \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3}{R^2} = \frac{4}{3} G \pi d R
\]

This shows that \( g \propto d \cdot R \). For the newly discovered planet, the gravitational acceleration on its surface is the same as Earth's (\( g_p = g_e \)), and its density is twice that of Earth (\( d_p = 2 \cdot d_e \)). Using the proportionality:

\[
g_p = g_e \implies d_p \cdot R_p = d_e \cdot R_e
\]

Substituting \( d_p = 2 \cdot d_e \):

\[
2 \cdot d_e \cdot R_p = d_e \cdot R_e
\]

Canceling \( d_e \) from both sides:

\[
2 \cdot R_p = R_e \implies R_p = \frac{R_e}{2}
\]

Earth's radius is approximately \( R_e = 6.38 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \). Therefore:

\[
R_p = \frac{6.38 \times 10^6}{2} = 3.19 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}
\]

Comparing this result to the given options, the closest match is:

**B: \( 3.19 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \)**.

Thus, the radius of the planet is **3.19 × 10⁶ meters**.
