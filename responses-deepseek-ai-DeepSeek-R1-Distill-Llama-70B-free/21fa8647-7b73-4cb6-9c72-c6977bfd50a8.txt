Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically personal injury in a movie theater. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The situation is that a seat in a movie theater collapsed, causing the customer to fall and injure their back. The customer is suing the theater for personal injury. The question is about whether the customer will recover damages and under what conditions.

The options are from A to I, each giving different conditions. I remember that premises liability is the key here. Premises liability deals with the duty of care that property owners owe to invitees, which in this case, the moviegoers are invitees because they're there for business purposes (the theater makes money from tickets).

So, the general idea is that a business has a duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition. That includes inspecting for dangers and either fixing them or warning customers about them. If the business fails to do that and someone gets hurt, they might be liable.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the customer won't recover because they assumed the risk by sitting there. I don't think that's right. Assumption of risk is when the plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily takes on a known risk. Here, the customer probably didn't know the seat was faulty, so assumption of risk doesn't apply.

Option B says the customer won't recover unless they told the theater about the faulty seat before. That doesn't sound right either. The duty is on the theater to discover dangers, not on the customer to inform them. So even if the customer didn't tell them, if the theater should have known, they could still be liable.

Option C states recovery only if there were previous complaints about the seat. I'm not sure. Previous complaints might show that the theater knew or should have known, but I don't think prior complaints are strictly necessary. The theater has a duty to inspect regularly, so even if it's the first complaint, if the inspection was lax, they might be liable.

Option D says recovery if the theater didn't put up a warning. That makes sense in some cases, but only if the theater knew or should have known about the danger. If they didn't know, failing to warn wouldn't be negligence. So maybe this is part of the consideration, but not the sole factor.

Option E: recovery only if the theater had prior knowledge. That's too strict. The theater could be liable under negligence if they should have known, even if they didn't have actual prior knowledge. So E seems incorrect because it's possible the theater didn't know but should have discovered the issue through reasonable inspection.

Option F: recover if the customer proves the theater's negligence in maintaining. This sounds right. The customer needs to show that the theater failed to exercise reasonable care in maintaining the seats, which led to the collapse. So if the theater was negligent in their maintenance, the customer can recover.

Option G: not recover unless the theater failed to make a reasonable inspection. Wait, isn't that the same as negligence? So the customer would have to show that the theater didn't inspect reasonably, which ties into negligence. So G is saying the customer can recover if the theater failed to inspect, which is part of the negligence claim. But I'm not sure if this is the best option, because F is more directly about proving negligence.

Option H: not recover because no permanent injury. I don't think that's a rule. Even if the injury isn't permanent, if there's actual harm, the customer can recover for things like medical bills, pain, etc. So H is incorrect.

Option I: not recover because the theater had no duty to inspect unknown dangers. That's wrong because businesses do have a duty to inspect for unknown dangers to ensure the premises are safe. So I is incorrect.

So, looking back, the main issue is whether the theater was negligent. The customer needs to prove that the theater failed to exercise reasonable care, which could involve inspecting the seats and maintaining them properly.

So between options F and G. Option F says "recover if the theater's negligence in maintaining the seat." Option G says "recover unless the theater failed to make a reasonable inspection."

Wait, the wording of G is "not recover, unless the theater failed to make a reasonable inspection." So if the theater did make a reasonable inspection, the customer doesn't recover. But if the theater failed to inspect, then the customer can recover. That's another way of saying that the theater's negligence (failing to inspect) leads to liability. So G is also about negligence.

Hmm, but F is about the theater's negligence in maintaining, which would include inspection and repair. So both F and G are about negligence, but phrased differently.

Wait, the question is about what the customer will most likely do. So in a premises liability case under negligence, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant breached their duty of care, which includes reasonable inspection and maintenance.

So which option aligns with that? Option F seems to state the general rule: the customer must prove negligence. Option G is a bit more specific about the inspection part.

Wait the options again:

F: recover, only if the theater's negligence in maintaining the seat.

G: not recover, unless the theater failed to make a reasonable inspection.

Wait, G is phrased as a condition. So if the theater failed to inspect reasonably, the customer can recover. Otherwise, they don't. But in premises liability, the theater's duty includes inspection. So if the theater didn't inspect, that's a breach. So G is correct in that the customer can recover if the theater failed to inspect. But F is about the theater's negligence in maintenance, which includes inspection.

Wait, perhaps both F and G are correct, but which one is the better answer.

Wait, another angle. In some jurisdictions, a business is not an insurer of the customer's safety, but must exercise reasonable care. So if the theater had no actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition, they might not be liable unless they failed to inspect.

So perhaps the correct answer is F, because it's about proving negligence, which includes both knowledge and failure to act.

Alternatively, option G is about the theater's duty to inspect. So perhaps G is the better answer.

I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think again. The elements for premises liability in negligence are:

1. Duty: which the theater owed to the customer as an invitee.

2. Breach: the theater failed to exercise reasonable care (e.g., didn't inspect or repair).

3. Causation: the breach caused the injury.

4. Damages: which the customer has.

So the customer must prove breach, which is the negligence. So F says they recover if they prove negligence in maintaining. G is about the failure to inspect, which is part of the breach.

Which option is more accurate? The question is asking under what condition the customer will most likely recover. So the correct condition is that the theater was negligent, which includes failing to inspect or maintain.

So looking at the options:

Option F says they recover if the theater was negligent in maintaining. That seems correct.

Option G says they can recover only if the theater failed to make a reasonable inspection. So G is a specific instance of negligence, but F is broader.

However, another thought: in premises liability, the plaintiff must show that the condition was dangerous, that the owner knew or should have known, and that the owner failed to remedy it. So perhaps the key is whether the theater knew or should have known, which relates to inspection.

So if the theater didn't inspect and therefore didn't discover the danger, that's negligence. So G is about the inspection part.

Wait, let me think about the options again.

Option E: recover only if the theater had prior knowledge of the dangerous condition.

That's incorrect because prior knowledge isn't necessary; constructive knowledge (what they should have known) is enough.

Option G: not recover unless the theater failed to make a reasonable inspection.

So if the theater did make reasonable inspections, the customer can't recover. That makes sense because if they did a reasonable inspection and didn't find the problem, they might not be negligent.

So perhaps G is correct.

Wait, but what if the theater did a reasonable inspection but missed the problem? Then they wouldn't be negligent. So the customer wouldn't recover unless the theater was negligent, which would include failing to inspect reasonably.

So G's condition is that the theater failed to make a reasonable inspection. So if the theater did inspect reasonably, then no recovery. If they didn't, then recovery is possible.

So G is about whether the theater failed in their inspection duty, which is part of the negligence determination.

So the correct answer would be F or G.

Hmm. I'm a bit torn. Another approach: in the absence of evidence that the theater knew or should have known about the defect, the customer can't recover. So the theater's failure to inspect would mean they should have known, hence negligence.

So perhaps G is correct.

Wait, but the question is about what the customer must prove. To prove negligence, the customer must show that the theater failed to exercise reasonable care, which includes inspecting.

So G is stating that unless the theater failed to inspect, the customer can't recover. That aligns with the negligence standard.

Alternatively, F says the customer must prove negligence in maintaining. Which is a broader statement.

So both F and G are about the same thing, but phrased differently.

Wait, the question is phrased as "the customer will most likely...", so which option reflects the general rule.

I think the correct answer is F: recover if the theater's negligence in maintaining the seat.

Wait, no, because F says "only if", which might be too restrictive. For example, if the theater had prior knowledge, they might be liable regardless of their maintenance. Or perhaps not.

Wait, in premises liability, the business must take reasonable steps to make the premises safe. This includes both inspecting for dangers and fixing them. So the breach could be in either failing to inspect or failing to repair.

So F is about the maintenance, which includes repair, but what about inspection? So perhaps F is incomplete because it doesn't mention inspection, but negligence could involve inspection as well.

Hmm. Maybe I should look up the standard for premises liability.

In general, a business has a duty to take reasonable steps to make the premises safe, including regular inspections to discover dangerous conditions and either repair them or warn customers. So to prove negligence, the customer must show that the business failed in this duty.

So the customer must prove that the theater was negligent, which could involve failing to inspect or failing to repair.

Looking back at the options, F says the customer recovers if the theater was negligent in maintaining. That would include failing to repair, but maybe not inspection.

Wait, "maintaining" could be interpreted to include inspection. So F covers both inspection and repair as part of maintenance.

So, the correct answer is F.

Wait, but some sources indicate that the key is whether the dangerous condition was known or should have been known to the business. So if the theater didn't know and couldn't have reasonably discovered it, they aren't liable. So the failure to inspect would mean they should have known.

So, maybe the more accurate answer is F because it's about negligence in maintenance, which would include inspection and repair.

Alternatively, the answer could be G, which focuses on the inspection aspect.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the better answer is F because it's about the theater's negligence, which covers all aspects of maintenance, including inspection.

Wait, but let's think of an example. If the theater regularly inspects the seats and, despite that, a seat collapses because of a sudden defect that couldn't have been detected, then the theater isn't liable. So in that case, the theater did their due diligence, so no negligence.

So the customer would only recover if the theater was negligent in their maintenance, which includes inspection and repair.

Thus, the correct answer is F.
</think>

In this case, the customer is suing the theater for personal injury caused by a collapsing seat. The key issue is whether the theater was negligent in maintaining the premises, which is a fundamental aspect of premises liability. As an invitee, the customer is owed a duty of care by the theater to ensure the premises are reasonably safe. This duty includes inspecting for dangerous conditions and taking steps to remedy them.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Assumption of risk applies when the plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily accepts a known risk. Here, the customer likely did not know the seat was faulty, so assumption of risk does not apply.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The theater has a duty to discover dangers through reasonable inspection, regardless of whether the customer informed them about the faulty seat.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Previous complaints are not strictly necessary for liability. The theater can be liable if it should have known about the dangerous condition through reasonable inspection, even if no prior complaints existed.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Failing to warn is only relevant if the theater knew or should have known about the danger. The absence of a warning alone does not establish negligence.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The theater can be liable even without prior knowledge if it should have discovered the dangerous condition through reasonable inspection.
- **Option F**: Correct. The customer must prove that the theater was negligent in maintaining the seat, which includes failing to inspect or repair. This aligns with the general rule of negligence in premises liability.
- **Option G**: Plausible but less precise. While failing to inspect is a specific aspect of negligence, the broader duty of care includes both inspection and maintenance. Option F encompasses this more comprehensively.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The customer can recover damages for any harm suffered, regardless of whether the injury is permanent.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Businesses do have a duty to inspect for unknown dangers to ensure the premises are safe.

### Conclusion:
The customer will most likely recover if they can prove the theater's negligence in maintaining the seat, which includes failing to inspect or repair. This makes **Option F** the best answer.
