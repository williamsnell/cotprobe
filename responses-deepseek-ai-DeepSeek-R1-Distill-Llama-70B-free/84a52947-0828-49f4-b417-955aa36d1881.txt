Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about why the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are so important in living matter. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, I remember that these four elements are the main components of biomolecules. Carbon is the backbone of all organic molecules, right? Like, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and DNA are all built with carbon chains. So carbon's ability to form long chains and rings is super important.

Hydrogen is also everywhere in these biomolecules. I think water is H₂O, which is a big part of cells. And in organic molecules, hydrogen is bonded with carbon and other elements. So they're all abundant in living things.

Oxygen is a major part of water and also part of many biomolecules, like carbohydrates and fats. Plus, oxygen is crucial for cellular respiration, which is how cells make energy.

Nitrogen is in amino acids, which make up proteins, and in the bases of DNA and RNA. So these elements are fundamental for structure and function.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says these are the only elements that can form gases at room temp. Well, I know that oxygen and nitrogen are gases, but carbon isn't a gas at room temp—it's solid. Hydrogen is a gas, but wait, are there other elements that can form gases? Like, maybe noble gases like helium or neon. So A might not be correct because it's not just these four, and also carbon isn't a gas.

Option B states they are abundant, can form covalent bonds, and are the lightest to do so. That sounds right. I mean, these elements are indeed some of the lightest, and they form a lot of covalent bonds. Carbon especially is known for forming four covalent bonds, which is why it's so versatile in organic chemistry. So B looks like a strong candidate.

Option C suggests they're the primary energy sources. That doesn't feel right. The primary energy source for cells is ATP, which is made using these elements, but the elements themselves aren't the energy sources. More like, they're the building blocks.

Option D says they're radioactive, which isn't true. None of these are radioactive in their common isotopes. So D is out.

Option E talks about sublimation, which is when a solid turns directly into gas. I don't think that's a key factor in why these elements are important. Maybe water sublimates, but that's not a reason for their importance in living matter.

Option F says they're rare and valuable. But in living organisms, these elements are actually quite abundant. So F is incorrect.

Option G is about giving color. I don't think that's it. While some biomolecules have color, like chlorophyll or hemoglobin, that's not why these elements are fundamental.

Option H says they're only in DNA and proteins. No, that's not right. They're in all sorts of biomolecules, including lipids, carbohydrates, etc. So H is wrong.

Option I claims they're the heaviest elements in organisms. No, heavier elements like oxygen (wait, no, oxygen is actually lighter than many). Wait, carbon is atomic number 6, hydrogen 1, oxygen 8, nitrogen 7. But in living organisms, there are heavier elements like phosphorus (15), sulfur (16), etc. So I is incorrect.

Option J says they have magnetic properties. I don't think any of these elements are magnetic in their pure form. Maybe some compounds have magnetic properties, but it's not a reason they're important for life.

So circling back, the best answer seems to be B. They're abundant, can form covalent bonds, and are the lightest to do so. That makes sense because lighter elements form longer and more varied chains more easily, which is crucial for the complex molecules needed in life.

The elements carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N) are of immense importance in living matter due to their unique chemical properties and abundance in biological systems. Carbon is the backbone of all organic molecules, forming long chains and rings, which is essential for the structure of biomolecules like proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and DNA. Hydrogen is a key component of water (H₂O) and organic molecules, bonding with carbon and other elements. Oxygen is critical for cellular respiration and is a major component of water and many biomolecules. Nitrogen is fundamental to amino acids, proteins, and the nucleotide bases of DNA and RNA.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because while some of these elements can form gases (e.g., oxygen and nitrogen), carbon is not a gas at room temperature, and other elements can also form gases.
- **B** is correct as these elements are abundant in living organisms, can readily form covalent bonds, and are among the lightest elements capable of doing so, making them ideal for forming complex biomolecules.
- **C** is incorrect because these elements are not the primary energy sources for living organisms; they are the building blocks of biomolecules.
- **D** is incorrect because none of these elements are radioactive in their common isotopes.
- **E** is incorrect because sublimation is not a key factor in their importance to living matter.
- **F** is incorrect because these elements are not rare; they are abundant in living organisms.
- **G** is incorrect because while some biomolecules have color, this is not the reason for the importance of these elements.
- **H** is incorrect because these elements are not exclusive to DNA and proteins; they are found in all biomolecules.
- **I** is incorrect because heavier elements like phosphorus and sulfur are also present in living organisms.
- **J** is incorrect because these elements do not have magnetic properties that are essential for life.

Thus, the correct answer is **B**. 

B
