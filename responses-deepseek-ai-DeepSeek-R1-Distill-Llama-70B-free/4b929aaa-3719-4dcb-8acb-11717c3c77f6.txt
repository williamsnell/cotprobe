Okay, so I've got this problem here about a two-level system and I'm supposed to find the temperature when the upper state's population is one-third of the lower state. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution being used for population ratios in energy levels. Oh right, the formula is something like the ratio of populations is equal to the exponential of negative energy difference over Boltzmann constant times temperature. So, the formula should be n_upper / n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)).

Wait, but wait. Let me get the exact formula right. The Boltzmann factor says that the ratio is e^(-ΔE/(k T)), right? So if the upper state is less populated than the lower, then the exponent would be negative, which makes sense because the upper state has higher energy.

In this problem, the population ratio is given as one-third. So n_upper is (1/3) n_lower. That means n_upper/n_lower = 1/3.

So plugging into the Boltzmann equation: 1/3 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Now, I need to solve for T. Let's rearrange this equation. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides should help. So ln(1/3) = -ΔE/(k T).

Hmm, ln(1/3) is equal to -ln(3), right? So that gives us -ln(3) = -ΔE/(k T). The negatives cancel out, so ln(3) = ΔE/(k T).

Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me check that again. If I have ln(1/3) = -ΔE/(k T), then that's the same as -ln(3) = -ΔE/(k T). So multiplying both sides by -1 gives ln(3) = ΔE/(k T). So yeah, that's correct.

So, rearranging for T, we get T = ΔE/(k * ln(3)).

Now, what's ΔE here? The problem says the energy separation is equivalent to 400 cm^-1. Oh wait, I think that energy in wavenumbers (cm^-1) can be converted to actual energy using the relation E = h c / λ, where λ is the wavelength in cm. But wait, wavenumber is 1/λ, so E = h c * wavenumber.

Right, so in terms of units, 1 cm^-1 corresponds to E = h c * 1 cm^-1. So h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light.

Wait, but I also remember that 1 cm^-1 is approximately 1.986 × 10^-23 J. Or wait, maybe it's better to recall the value of hc in terms of cm and J. Let's see, h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and c is about 3 x 10^10 cm/s. So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e10 = let's calculate that.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e10 = 1.9878e-23 J·cm. Oh wait, because cm is in the denominator when you multiply by wavenumber (which is cm^-1), so J·cm * cm^-1 gives J.

So for 400 cm^-1, ΔE = 400 * hc, so in J that's 400 * 1.9878e-23 J. Let me compute that. 400 * 1.9878e-23 = approximately 7.9512e-21 J.

Wait, but wait, maybe I can remember that 1 cm^-1 is about 0.01986 eV. Because 1 eV is about 8065.5 cm^-1, so 1 cm^-1 is 1/8065.5 eV. Let me compute that: 1 / 8065.5 ≈ 1.24e-4 eV. But wait, I might have that wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I know that k, the Boltzmann constant, is approximately 8.617 x 10^-5 eV/K. Or in J, it's 1.38e-23 J/K.

So perhaps it's easier to calculate using eV and then convert to J.

Wait, but maybe I can use the conversion factor that 1 cm^-1 is equal to (h c)/ (1 cm) in energy. So h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s, which is 3e10 cm/s. So h*c is 6.626e-34 * 3e10 = 1.9878e-23 J·cm. So 400 cm^-1 is 400 * 1.9878e-23 J = 7.9512e-21 J.

But wait, let me double-check that calculation. 400 * 1.9878e-23 = ?

Well, 400 * 1e-23 is 4e-21. 400 * 0.9878e-23 is 3.9512e-21. So total is 4e-21 + 3.9512e-21 = 7.9512e-21 J. Yep.

Alternatively, maybe using the relation E (in J) = (400 cm^-1) * (hc in J·cm) = 400 * 1.986e-23 J.

So ΔE is 7.944e-21 J.

Wait, but maybe I should just use E = 400 cm^-1 * (h c) where h c is about 1.986e-23 J·cm. So yes, same as above.

So, moving on. We have T = ΔE / (k * ln(3)).

We know that k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So plugging in the numbers:

ΔE is 7.944e-21 J.

So T = (7.944e-21 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * ln(3)).

First, compute ln(3). ln(3) is approximately 1.0986.

So denominator becomes 1.38e-23 * 1.0986 ≈ 1.38 * 1.0986 = about 1.516e-23.

So T = 7.944e-21 / 1.516e-23.

Compute that division: 7.944e-21 / 1.516e-23.

Let me compute 7.944 / 1.516 first. 1.516 * 5 = 7.58. So 5.23 approximately.

So 5.23e2 K, which is 523 K.

Wait, because 7.944e-21 divided by 1.516e-23 is (7.944 / 1.516) * (1e-21 / 1e-23) ) = approx 5.23 * 100 = 523 K.

Looking at the options, option G is 524 K, which is very close. So the answer must be G.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure.

Let me recompute the denominator.

k * ln(3) = 1.38e-23 J/K * 1.0986 ≈ 1.38 * 1.0986 = 1.516e-23 J/K.

ΔE = 400 cm^-1 * hc = 400 * 1.986e-23 J = 7.944e-21 J.

So T = 7.944e-21 / (1.516e-23) = (7.944 / 1.516) * 1e2.

Calculating 7.944 / 1.516: Let's do it more accurately.

1.516 × 5 = 7.58, so 5.0 gives 7.58, which is less than 7.944. The difference is 7.944 -7.58 = 0.364.

So 0.364 / 1.516 ≈ 0.24.

So total is 5.24, so 5.24 * 1e2 = 524 K.

That's exactly option G, 524 K.

So the correct answer is G.

To determine the temperature of a two-level system where the population of the upper state is one-third that of the lower state, we use the Boltzmann distribution. The population ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = e^{-\Delta E / (k T)}
\]

Here, \( \frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{1}{3} \), so:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = e^{-\Delta E / (k T)}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{\Delta E}{k T}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-\ln(3) = -\frac{\Delta E}{k T}
\]

Canceling the negatives:

\[
\ln(3) = \frac{\Delta E}{k T}
\]

Rearranging for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{\Delta E}{k \ln(3)}
\]

The energy separation \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 400 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1} \). Converting this to joules:

\[
\Delta E = 400 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1} \times h c = 400 \times 1.986 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J} = 7.944 \times 10^{-21} \, \mathrm{J}
\]

Substituting \( \Delta E = 7.944 \times 10^{-21} \, \mathrm{J} \), \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/K} \), and \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \):

\[
T = \frac{7.944 \times 10^{-21}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 1.0986}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 1.0986 = 1.516 \times 10^{-23}
\]

Now divide:

\[
T = \frac{7.944 \times 10^{-21}}{1.516 \times 10^{-23}} = \left(\frac{7.944}{1.516}\right) \times 10^2 \approx 5.24 \times 10^2 \, \mathrm{K}
\]

Thus, \( T \approx 524 \, \mathrm{K} \).

From the given options, the closest value is **524 K**, which corresponds to option **G**.
