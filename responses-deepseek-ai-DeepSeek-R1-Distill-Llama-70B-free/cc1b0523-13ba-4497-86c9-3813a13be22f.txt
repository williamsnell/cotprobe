Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. It says a car starts from rest and uniformly accelerates to a final speed of 20.0 m/s in 15 seconds. The question is asking how far the car travels during this time. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when something starts from rest and accelerates uniformly, there are some kinematic equations that apply. Oh right, the equations of motion. Let me think. Since the acceleration is constant, I can use the equations that relate initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, time, and distance.

Wait, the car starts from rest, so the initial velocity u is 0. The final velocity v is 20 m/s, and the time t is 15 seconds. I need to find the distance traveled, which is displacement in this case since it's moving in a straight line.

I think the equation I need is the one that gives the displacement when initial velocity, acceleration, and time are known. Or wait, maybe the one that uses the average velocity. Oh right, because when acceleration is uniform, the average velocity can be used to find the distance.

So average velocity is (u + v)/2. Since u is 0, it's just v/2. So average velocity would be 20/2 = 10 m/s. Then, the distance is average velocity multiplied by time, which is 10 m/s * 15 s = 150 meters. Wait, but looking at the options, J is 150 m. But I'm not sure if I did that right.

Alternatively, I could use the equation s = ut + (1/2) a t squared. Since u is 0, the first term is zero, so s = 0.5 * a * t². But I don't have 'a' yet. Oh wait, I can find a from the given data. The final velocity v is equal to u + a t. Since u is 0, v = a t. So a = v/t = 20/15 = 1.333... m/s².

Plugging that into the displacement equation: s = 0.5 * (1.333) * (15)^2. Let's compute 15 squared: 225. 0.5 times 1.333 is approximately 0.6665. So 0.6665 * 225. Let's see, 225 * (2/3) is 150. So yeah, s is 150 meters.

Wait, but wait another second. If I use the average velocity method, it's straightforward. So the answer should be 150 m, which is option J. But looking back at the options, I see option E is 450, which is 3 times 150. Did I miss something here?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. The average velocity is (0 + 20)/2 = 10 m/s. Time is 15 s. So 10 * 15 = 150 m. That seems right. So why isn't 150 one of the more prominent options? Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 1050 m

B: 600 m

C: 350 m

D: 200 m

E: 450 m

F: 500 m

G: 300 m

H: 900 m

I: 750 m

J: 150 m

So J is 150. But wait, I've got a vague memory sometimes when time is longer, but maybe I'm mixing up the equations.

Wait another thought: if the acceleration is uniform, another equation is v squared equals u squared plus 2 a s. But since u is zero, v squared is 2 a s. Hmm, but I don't have a here. Alternatively, since I found a to be 20/15 = 4/3 m/s², then s would be v²/(2a). So 20^2 / (2*(4/3)) = 400 / (8/3) = 400 * 3/8 = 150. Same result.

So I think I'm confident it's 150 m. So the correct answer should be J: 150 m.

To determine how far the car travels during its uniform acceleration from rest to a final speed of 20.0 m/s in 15.0 seconds, we can use the concept of average velocity. Since the car starts from rest, the initial velocity \( u = 0 \), and the final velocity \( v = 20.0 \, \text{m/s} \). The average velocity during uniformly accelerated motion is given by:

\[
v_{\text{avg}} = \frac{u + v}{2} = \frac{0 + 20.0}{2} = 10.0 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

The distance traveled is then the product of the average velocity and the time:

\[
s = v_{\text{avg}} \cdot t = 10.0 \cdot 15.0 = 150.0 \, \text{m}.
\]

This result can also be verified using the kinematic equation \( s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \), where \( u = 0 \). First, calculate the acceleration \( a \) using \( v = u + at \):

\[
a = \frac{v}{t} = \frac{20.0}{15.0} = 1.333 \, \text{m/s}^2.
\]

Substituting into the equation for \( s \):

\[
s = 0 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1.333 \cdot (15.0)^2 = 0.6665 \cdot 225 = 150.0 \, \text{m}.
\]

Both methods confirm that the car travels \( 150.0 \, \text{m} \). Comparing this result to the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: 150 m**
