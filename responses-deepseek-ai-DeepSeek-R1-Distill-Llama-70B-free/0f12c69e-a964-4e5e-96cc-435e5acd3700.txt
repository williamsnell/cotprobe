Okay, so I've got this problem about vapor pressure and molar mass. Hmm, I remember that when a non-volatile solute is added to a solvent, the vapor pressure of the solvent decreases. The formula I think relates to Raoult's Law, which is about the lowering of vapor pressure.

Wait, Raoult's Law says that the partial vapor pressure of the solvent is equal to the mole fraction of the solvent multiplied by the vapor pressure of the pure solvent. Oh right, and the lowering is given by ΔP = X_solute * P_pure. Or wait, actually, the formula is P = X_solvent * P_pure, so the change in vapor pressure (ΔP) would be P_pure - P_solution. And ΔP over P_pure is equal to the mole fraction of the solute. Because mole fraction of solute is (moles solute)/(moles solute + moles solvent), but since the solute is non-volatile, maybe the denominator is just moles of solvent. Wait, no, the mole fraction of solvent is (moles solvent)/(moles solvent + moles solute), and the mole fraction of solute is the other part. So the formula for lowering is (ΔP / P_pure) = mole fraction of solute.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. Raoult's law: P = X_solvent * P^0, where P^0 is pure solvent's vapor pressure. So the change in pressure is P^0 - P = X_solute * P^0. Because X_solvent = 1 - X_solute, so P = (1 - X_solute) * P^0. So rearranged, (P^0 - P)/P^0 = X_solute.

So in this problem, P^0 is 53.3 kPa, and P is 51.5 kPa. So the change is 53.3 -51.5 = 1.8 kPa. Then ΔP / P^0 is 1.8 /53.3.

Let me calculate that. 1.8 divided by 53.3. Let's see: 53.3 is about 53.3, so 1.8/53.3 ≈ 0.03377. So X_solute is approximately 0.03377.

Now, mole fraction X_solute is moles solute divided by (moles solute + moles solvent). But wait, the solute is in a small amount compared to the solvent, so maybe we can approximate it as X_solute ≈ moles solute / moles solvent. Because if n_solute is much smaller than n_solvent, then n_solute + n_solvent ≈ n_solvent, so it's a decent approximation.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Let me think. The solvent is 500 g of benzene. Benzene's molar mass is about 78 g/mol (since C6H6: 6*12 +6*1=72+6=78). So moles of benzene would be 500 g /78 g/mol ≈ 6.410 moles.

Now, the solute is 19.0 g, and its molar mass is what we're trying to find. Let's call it M. So moles solute is 19/M.

So the mole fraction of solute is (19/M) / ( (500/78) + (19/M) ) .

But if M is large, like say 100 g/mol, then moles solute is 0.19, which is much less than 6.41, so denominator is ≈6.41. So X_solute ≈ (0.19)/6.41 ≈ 0.0296. But earlier, we had X_solute as approx 0.03377. Hmm, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write the equation properly.

We have X_solute = (n_solute) / (n_solute + n_solvent) )

But since n_solute is much smaller than n_solvent, perhaps it's negligible in the denominator. So X_solute ≈ n_solute / n_solvent.

So let's proceed with that approximation.

So X_solute ≈ (19/M) / (500/78) ) = (19/M) * (78/500) ) = (19 *78) / (500 M).

We found earlier that X_solute is approximately 0.03377. So,

(19 *78)/(500 M) ) = 0.03377.

Let me compute 19*78. 19*70=1330, 19*8=152, total 1330+152=1482. So,

1482 / (500 M) = 0.03377.

So solving for M:

M = 1482 / (500 * 0.03377 )

Calculate denominator: 500 *0.03377 = 16.885.

So M = 1482 / 16.885 ≈ let's compute that.

1482 ÷16.885. Let me approximate.

16.885 * 87 = let's see: 16*87= 1392, 0.885*87≈77. So total around 1469. Close to 1482. So 87 gives about 1469. 1482-1469=13. So 13/16.885≈0.77. So M≈87.77.

Wait but the answer options don't have 87. Let me check the options again.

Options are A:105, B:90, C:75, D:95, E:80, F:70, G:120, H:100, I:85, J:110.

Hmm, 87 is closest to B (90) or I (85). Let me think, perhaps my approximation was wrong.

Wait, maybe the approximation that X_solute ≈ n_solute / n_solvent isn't good enough. Because 0.03377 is not that small, so maybe I should consider the exact equation.

So, X_solute = (n_solute) / (n_solute + n_solvent )

We have X_solute = (19/M) / (500/78 + 19/M )

Set this equal to 0.03377.

So,

(19/M) / ( (500/78) + (19/M) ) ) = 0.03377

Let me denote (500/78) as a constant. 500/78 ≈6.410256.

Let me rewrite:

(19/M) / (6.410256 + 19/M ) = 0.03377

Multiply both sides by denominator:

19/(M) = 0.03377 * (6.410256 + 19/M )

Expand the right side:

0.03377 * 6.410256 + 0.03377*(19/M)

Compute 0.03377 *6.410256:

6.410256 *0.03 is 0.1923, 6.410256 *0.00377≈approx 0.02418 (since 6*0.00377=0.0226, 0.410256 *0.00377≈0.00155). So total around 0.1923 +0.02418≈0.2165.

So right side becomes approx 0.2165 + (0.03377 *19)/M.

So equation is:

19/M = 0.2165 + (0.64163)/M

Multiply both sides by M:

19 = 0.2165 M + 0.64163

Bring 0.64163 to left:

19 -0.64163 =0.2165 M → 18.35837=0.2165 M → M≈18.35837 /0.2165 ≈ 84.8 g/mol.

Hmm, 84.8, which is close to 85, option I. But wait, let me calculate more accurately.

Let me redo the calculation without approximations.

Compute 0.03377 *6.410256:

6.410256 *0.03377.

Let me compute 6 *0.03377=0.20262; 0.410256 *0.03377.

0.4 *0.03377=0.013508; 0.010256 *0.03377≈0.000346.

So total 0.013508 +0.000346=0.013854.

So 0.20262 + 0.013854 = 0.216474.

So right side is 0.216474 + (0.03377 *19)/M.

So equation:

19/M = 0.216474 + (0.64163)/M.

Multiply both sides by M:

19 = 0.216474 M + 0.64163.

19 -0.64163 = 0.216474 M → 18.35837 =0.216474 M → M= 18.35837 / 0.216474 ≈ let's compute that.

Compute 18.35837 ÷0.216474.

Let me see: 0.216474 * 84 = 18.204 (because 0.216474 *80=17.3179, 0.216474*4=0.8659 → total 18.1838). 84 → 0.216474 *84= approx 18.1838.

18.35837 -18.1838 ≈0.1746. So 0.1746 /0.216474 ≈ 0.806. So total is 84.806. So M≈84.8 g/mol. So about 85.

Looking at the options, option I is 85. That would be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made an error in the setup. Let me recheck.

The formula: X_solute = (moles solute) / (moles solute + moles solvent).

Yes.

So,

X_solute = (19/M) / (500/78 + 19/M )

Which is:

(19/M) / ( (500 M +78*19 )/(78 M) ) ) = (19 *78 )/(500 M + 78*19 )

Wait, maybe another approach: cross-multiplying.

X_solute = (n_solute) / (n_solvent +n_solute) ) → X = (n) / (N +n ), where n is moles solute, N moles solvent.

So,

X = (n) / (N +n ) → X (N +n ) = n → X N + X n =n → X N = n (1 -X )

→ n = (X N )/(1 - X )

Wait, maybe that's a better approach.

Given that X is 0.03377, N is 500/78 ≈6.410256.

So n = (0.03377 *6.410256 ) / (1 -0.03377 )

Compute denominator: 1 -0.03377=0.96623.

Compute numerator: 0.03377 *6.410256 ≈0.21647.

So n=0.21647/0.96623≈0.224 moles.

Wait, n is moles solute, which is 19.0g / M = n → M =19 /n → M=19/0.224 ≈84.8 g/mol. Again, same result.

So the molar mass is approximately 84.8, which is closest to option I:85.

So the correct answer is I.

To solve the problem, we use Raoult's Law, which states that the lowering of vapor pressure is proportional to the mole fraction of the solute. The formula is:

\[
\frac{\Delta P}{P^\circ} = X_{\text{solute}}
\]

Where:
- \( \Delta P = P^\circ - P \) is the change in vapor pressure,
- \( P^\circ \) is the vapor pressure of pure benzene,
- \( X_{\text{solute}} \) is the mole fraction of the solute.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta P \) and \( X_{\text{solute}} \)
Given:
- \( P^\circ = 53.3 \, \mathrm{kPa} \),
- \( P = 51.5 \, \mathrm{kPa} \),
- \( \Delta P = P^\circ - P = 53.3 - 51.5 = 1.8 \, \mathrm{kPa} \).

\[
X_{\text{solute}} = \frac{\Delta P}{P^\circ} = \frac{1.8}{53.3} \approx 0.03377
\]

### Step 2: Relate \( X_{\text{solute}} \) to moles of solute and solvent
The mole fraction of the solute is given by:

\[
X_{\text{solute}} = \frac{n_{\text{solute}}}{n_{\text{solute}} + n_{\text{solvent}}}
\]

Where:
- \( n_{\text{solute}} = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{molar mass of solute}} = \frac{19.0}{M} \),
- \( n_{\text{solvent}} = \frac{\text{mass of solvent}}{\text{molar mass of benzene}} = \frac{500}{78} \approx 6.410 \).

Substituting into the equation:

\[
X_{\text{solute}} = \frac{\frac{19.0}{M}}{\frac{19.0}{M} + 6.410}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( M \)
Rearranging:

\[
X_{\text{solute}} = \frac{\frac{19.0}{M}}{\frac{19.0}{M} + 6.410}
\]

Multiply through by the denominator:

\[
X_{\text{solute}} \left( \frac{19.0}{M} + 6.410 \right) = \frac{19.0}{M}
\]

Expand and simplify:

\[
0.03377 \cdot 6.410 + 0.03377 \cdot \frac{19.0}{M} = \frac{19.0}{M}
\]

\[
0.21647 + 0.64163 \cdot \frac{1}{M} = \frac{19.0}{M}
\]

Multiply through by \( M \):

\[
0.21647 \cdot M + 0.64163 = 19.0
\]

\[
0.21647 \cdot M = 19.0 - 0.64163
\]

\[
0.21647 \cdot M = 18.35837
\]

\[
M = \frac{18.35837}{0.21647} \approx 84.8 \, \mathrm{g/mol}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the closest option
The calculated molar mass is approximately \( 84.8 \, \mathrm{g/mol} \), which is closest to option **I: 85 \, \mathrm{g/mol}**.
