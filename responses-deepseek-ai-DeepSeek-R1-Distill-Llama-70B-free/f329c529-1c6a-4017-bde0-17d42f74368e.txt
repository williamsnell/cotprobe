Okay, so I have this problem here where May C. Carlisle went on a business trip and spent money on various things. I need to figure out how much she has left after all her expenses. She started with $300 and paid cash for everything. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll list out all her expenses. Let me jot them down:

- Hotel: $63.00
- Meals: $42.90
- Laundry: $3.75
- Tips: $9.50
- Taxis: $7.85
- Telephone: $11.30
- Customer entertainment: $36.60
- Supplies: $4.30

Hmm, I need to add all these amounts together to find the total she spent. Then subtract that total from $300 to find out how much she has left.

Let me start adding them one by one. Maybe I'll add the smaller amounts first to make it easier.

Starting with laundry, which is $3.75. Then tips are $9.50. So 3.75 + 9.50 is... let me see, 3 + 9 is 12, and 0.75 + 0.50 is 1.25, so total is 13.25.

Next, taxis are $7.85. Adding that to the previous total: 13.25 + 7.85. Hmm, 13 + 7 is 20, 0.25 + 0.85 is 1.10. So 20 + 1.10 is 21.10.

Then telephone is $11.30. Adding that: 21.10 + 11.30. 21 + 11 is 32, 0.10 + 0.30 is 0.40. So now we're at 32.40.

Supplies are $4.30. Adding that: 32.40 + 4.30. 32 +4 is 36, 0.40 +0.30 is 0.70. So 36.70.

Now the bigger expenses. Meals are $42.90. Adding to 36.70: 36.70 +42.90. Let's see, 36+42 is 78, 0.70 +0.90 is 1.60. So total is 79.60.

Hotel is $63.00. Adding that: 79.60 +63.00. 79+63 is 142, 0.60 remains. So 142.60.

Customer entertainment is $36.60. Adding to 142.60: 142.60 +36.60. 142 +36 is 178, 0.60 +0.60 is 1.20, so total is 179.20.

Wait, did I miss anything? Let me check. The list includes all eight items. Okay, so the total spent is $179.20.

She started with $300. So subtracting the total expenses: 300 - 179.20 equals... 300 minus 179 is 121, and then minus 0.20 would be 120.80.

Wait, but let me double-check my addition because sometimes I might make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should add all the numbers again more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe I should write them down vertically to add properly.

Let me try adding all the expenses again:

Hotel: 63.00
Meals: 42.90
Laundry: 3.75
Tips: 9.50
Taxis: 7.85
Telephone:11.30
Entertainment:36.60
Supplies:4.30

Let's add them in a column:

63.00
+42.90
-----
105.90

Plus 3.75:
105.90 +3.75 = 109.65

Plus 9.50: 109.65 +9.50 = 119.15

Plus 7.85: 119.15 +7.85 = 127.00

Plus 11.30: 127.00 +11.30 = 138.30

Plus 36.60: 138.30 +36.60 = 174.90

Plus 4.30: 174.90 +4.30 = 179.20

Yes, that matches what I had before. So the total spent is indeed $179.20.

So subtracting from $300: 300 - 179.20 = 120.80.

Looking at the options, option A is $120.80. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:

A: $120.80
B: $150.45
C: $300.00
D: $178.55
E: $179.20
F: $134.90
G: $98.10
H: $63.00
I: $121.70
J: $111.25

Yes, A is $120.80, which is what I calculated. So the correct answer is A.

To determine how much May C. Carlisle had left after her business trip, we first calculate her total expenses by summing the amounts spent on various items:

- Hotel: $63.00  
- Meals: $42.90  
- Laundry: $3.75  
- Tips: $9.50  
- Taxis: $7.85  
- Telephone: $11.30  
- Customer Entertainment: $36.60  
- Supplies: $4.30  

Adding these amounts step by step:  
$63.00 + $42.90 = $105.90  
$105.90 + $3.75 = $109.65  
$109.65 + $9.50 = $119.15  
$119.15 + $7.85 = $127.00  
$127.00 + $11.30 = $138.30  
$138.30 + $36.60 = $174.90  
$174.90 + $4.30 = $179.20  

Thus, the total expenses amount to **$179.20**.  

May started with $300. Subtracting her total expenses from this amount:  
$300.00 - $179.20 = $120.80  

Therefore, the amount she had left is **$120.80**.  

The correct answer is **A**.
