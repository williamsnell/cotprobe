Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the global fertility rate as of 2015. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one. Let me think through this.

First, I remember that fertility rate is the average number of children a woman has over her lifetime. I think the global average has been declining over the years. I've heard that replacing the population requires about 2.1 children per woman, considering mortality rates and such. But that's just the replacement level.

Wait, so if the replacement is around 2.1, then globally, the fertility rate must be a bit above or below that. I'm trying to recall any recent data. Oh, I think around 2015, the world was seeing a fertility rate that was just at or below replacement level in many countries, but globally it might still be a bit higher.

I remember reading that in some regions, like Europe, the fertility rate is quite low, sometimes below 1.5. But in other parts of the world, like Africa, the rates are higher, maybe around 4 or 5. So the global average would be somewhere in between. 

Wait, I think the global fertility rate peaked around the mid-20th century and has been declining since. So in 2015, I believe it was around 2.5 children per woman. That seems familiar because I remember seeing graphs where the line was going down and crossed around 2.5 in the mid-2010s.

Let me look at the options again. Option A is 2, which I think is the replacement level but maybe the actual average was a bit higher. Option I is 2.5, which sounds right. Option G is 3, which might have been the case a few decades ago. Option E is 4.5, which seems too high for the global average by 2015. So I'm leaning towards option I: 2.5 children per woman.

As of 2015, the global fertility rate was around 2.5 children per woman. This reflects a decline from higher rates in previous decades, influenced by factors such as urbanization and improved access to contraception. While some regions had higher or lower rates, the global average was approximately 2.5. 

The correct answer is I: 2.5 children per woman.

Answer: I
