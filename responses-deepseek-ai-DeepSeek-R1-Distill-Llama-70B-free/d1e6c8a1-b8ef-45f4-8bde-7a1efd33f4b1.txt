Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about business cycles, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is asking about business cycles, and there are ten options labeled A to J. I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should recall what business cycles are. From what I remember, business cycles refer to the fluctuations in economic activity that an economy experiences over time. They have different phases, like expansion (recovery), peak, contraction (recession), and trough. So they're about the ups and downs of the economy.

Looking at the options:

Option A: "are the natural fluctuations in the price of goods and services." Hmm, I think this might be mixing up concepts. Fluctuations in prices are more related to inflation or deflation, not business cycles. Business cycles are about economic activity, not just prices.

Option B: "only occur in developing economies." No, that doesn't sound right. I remember that business cycles occur in economies regardless of whether they're developed or developing. So this is incorrect.

Option C: "are always triggered by a financial crisis." I don't think that's correct. While financial crises can cause recessions, business cycles can be influenced by various factors like changes in consumer spending, investment, government policies, technological changes, etc. So it's not always a financial crisis.

Option D: "are the result of governmental fiscal policy." That seems too narrow. Fiscal policy can influence the economy, but business cycles are a broader phenomenon caused by multiple factors, including private sector behavior. So this is not the right answer.

Option E: "are steady and consistent changes in economic activity." Wait, steady and consistent? No, business cycles are anything but steady. They're about fluctuations, so this is the opposite of what they are.

Option F: "are predictable ups and downs in economic activity." Predictable? I'm not sure. While there might be some patterns, business cycles are not entirely predictable. Economists try to forecast them, but they're not always accurate. So I'm not certain about this one.

Option G: "occur infrequently in capitalist economies." No, business cycles are a regular feature of capitalist economies. They happen periodically, so this is incorrect.

Option H: "refer to reusing resources in production." That sounds more like recycling or sustainability practices, not business cycles. So H is unrelated.

Option I: "are each comprised of a recession and an expansion." Wait, each business cycle includes phases like expansion, peak, contraction (recession), and trough. So a cycle includes both expansion and recession phases. So this option is correct because each cycle has both. But wait, let me think. Is each cycle just one recession and one expansion? Actually, a full cycle is from one phase to the same phase again, so yes, each cycle includes a recession and an expansion.

Option J: "refer to the cycle of a business from startup to maturity." No, that's more about the life cycle of a particular business, not the economy-wide cycles. So J is incorrect.

Now, looking back at the options, I think I is correct because each business cycle includes both a recession and an expansion phase.

Wait, but let me double-check. The business cycle typically includes four phases: expansion (recovery), peak, contraction (recession), and trough. So the cycle goes from trough to peak (expansion) and back to trough (contraction). So each cycle includes expansion and contraction, which are recession and expansion. So yes, I is correct.

But wait, let me make sure. The question is about what each business cycle is comprised of. So each cycle has phases, including both expansion and recession. So I is correct.

Another option is F, which says they're predictable. But business cycles aren't entirely predictable. So F is wrong.

So the correct answer should be I.

The correct answer is I.

I: are each comprised of a recession and an expansion.

Answer: I
