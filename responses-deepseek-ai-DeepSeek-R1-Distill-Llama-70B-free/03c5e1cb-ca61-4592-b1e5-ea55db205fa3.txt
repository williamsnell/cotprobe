Question:

An employment placement agency specializes in placing workers in jobs suited for them. From past experience, the agency knows that 20% of all the workers it places will no longer be at the position in which they were placed after one year; however, only 5% of those remaining after the first year leave during the next year. At the start of a year an employer hires 100 workers using this agency, then at the start of the next year the employer hires 100 more. How many of these 200 workers are expected to be on the job at the end of the second year?

Options:

A: 140
B: 160
C: 142
D: 144
E: 165
F: 155
G: 148
H: 156
I: 152
J: 150

Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about employment placement and worker retention over two years. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

So, the setup is that an agency places workers, and we have some data on how long they stay. The employer hires 100 workers at the start of the first year and another 100 at the start of the second year. We need to find out how many of these 200 are expected to still be on the job at the end of the second year.

Wait, so the problem is about two groups of workers: the first 100 hired at the start of year one, and the second 100 hired at the start of year two. Each group will experience some attrition over the years, and we need to track both groups to find the total remaining after two years.

Let me think about the first group. So, the first 100 are hired at the start of year one. After one year, 20% of them leave. That means 20% of 100 is 20, so 80 remain after the first year. Now, for those who remain after the first year, only 5% leave in the next year. So, of those 80, 5% leave during the second year. What's 5% of 80? That's 4, so 76 remain after the second year.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says that in the first year, 20% are gone. Then, of those who are left after the first year, 5% leave during the next year. So, from the first group: after year 1, 80 remain. Then, during year 2, 5% of those 80 leave. So yes, 5% of 80 is 4, so 76 remain after the second year.

Now, the second group: 100 workers hired at the start of year two. So, for them, they only go through one year of attrition. So, after year two (which is their first year), 20% leave. So, 20% of 100 is 20, so 80 remain at the end of year two.

So, adding both groups: 76 (from the first group) + 80 (from the second group) = 156. So the total expected is 156.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm making a mistake with the timing.

First group: Year 1: 100 hired. After year 1, 20% leave â†’ 80 left. Then, during year 2, 5% of those 80 leave, which is 4. So 76 remain.

Second group: Hired at the start of year 2. So, during year 2, which is their first year, 20% leave. So 80 left after year 2.

Total at end of year 2: 76 +80=156.

Looking at the options, option H is 156. So the answer should be H.

To determine how many workers are expected to remain on the job at the end of the second year, we analyze the retention rates for two groups of workers: 

1. **First Group (Hired at the start of Year 1):**  
   - Initially, 100 workers are hired.  
   - After Year 1, 20% leave, so 80 workers remain.  
   - In Year 2, 5% of the remaining 80 workers leave, which is 4 workers.  
   - Therefore, 76 workers from this group remain at the end of Year 2.  

2. **Second Group (Hired at the start of Year 2):**  
   - Initially, 100 workers are hired.  
   - After Year 2 (their first year), 20% leave, so 80 workers remain.  

Adding the remaining workers from both groups:  
- 76 (from the first group) + 80 (from the second group) = 156 workers.  

Thus, the total number of workers expected to be on the job at the end of the second year is **156**.  

The correct answer is **H**.
