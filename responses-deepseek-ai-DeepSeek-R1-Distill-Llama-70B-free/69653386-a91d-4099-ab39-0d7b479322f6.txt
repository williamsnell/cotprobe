Okay, so I have this question about energy balance in a healthy person. Hmm, I need to think about how the body maintains energy equilibrium. The question is asking on what time basis this balance is achieved. The options are from A to J, each with different time frames.

Wait, energy balance means that the energy intake (what you eat) equals energy expenditure (what you burn). So when you're in equilibrium, you're not gaining or losing weight. But how often does the body check this balance?

I remember that the body doesn't maintain this balance every single day. Like, some days you might eat more, others less, but over time it evens out. So it's not a day-to-day thing. That would be option J, but I don't think that's right because people don't usually eat exactly the same calories each day.

Maybe it's weekly? Like, if you overeat one day and undereat another, it balances over the week. So maybe option G? Or wait, is it longer than a week?

Wait, I think the body's energy balance is regulated over a longer period. I've heard that weight changes are usually assessed over weeks because the body's systems don't adjust that quickly. So like, if you're in a caloric deficit, you might not see changes for a week or two.

But the question is about when the equilibrium is achieved. So when energy intake equals expenditure on average. Maybe it's not every day, but perhaps the body can adjust within a few days. Like, if you eat a big meal, your metabolism might increase a bit the next day to burn it off. So maybe it balances every few days.

Alternatively, some studies suggest that the body's energy balance is regulated over a period of about a week. So the correct answer might be on a weekly basis, which is option G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Another thought: the body's immediate energy needs are regulated minute by minute, like insulin and glucose levels. But that's more about blood sugar, not overall energy balance. For fat storage and metabolism adjustments, it's a slower process.

So if someone eats more calories one day, the body might store them as fat, and then over the next few days, as they eat less, it uses that fat. So maybe the balance is achieved over a few days, like every 2-3 days? That would be option I.

Alternatively, some people say that the body's energy balance is maintained over a week. So if you have a caloric surplus one day, the next day your body might expend more, balancing it out over a week.

I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: think about the time frames. Daily (J) would mean each day exactly, which isn't realistic. Hourly (D) is way too short. Monthly (E) seems too long. So between a few days and a week.

I think the general consensus is that energy balance is achieved over a weekly basis. So option G. But wait, another angle: some sources say that the body's weight can fluctuate daily due to water and food intake, but the actual energy balance in terms of calories in vs out is managed over a longer period, maybe a week or so.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is G: Weekly basis.

The question asks about the time frame over which a healthy person maintains energy balance, where energy intake equals energy expenditure. The key is understanding that while daily fluctuations occur (e.g., eating more one day and less the next), the body achieves equilibrium over a longer period. 

Day-to-day balance (option J) is unrealistic because calorie intake often varies. Hourly (D) and monthly (E) bases are too short or long, respectively. The body adjusts metabolism and energy storage gradually, typically over several days to a week. While some adjustments can occur within a few days, the broader consensus is that equilibrium is maintained on a weekly basis, as this allows for balancing fluctuations in intake and expenditure.

Answer: G
