Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about older adults and memory types. Hmm, I need to figure out which kind of memory they perform well in when tested. Let me think.

The question is: Older adults generally perform very well when their _____ memory is tested. The options are A to J, each a different type of memory.

I remember that as people age, different types of memory can be affected differently. I think that explicit memory, which includes things like remembering events or facts, might decline. But implicit memory, which is more about unconscious memories like skills or habits, tends to stay more intact.

Wait, what's the difference between explicit and implicit again? Explicit is like consciously recalling information, such as what you did yesterday. Implicit is more automatic, like riding a bike without thinking. So older adults might do better on implicit tasks because those don't rely as much on the hippocampus, which I think is affected by aging.

Looking at the options, option C is Implicit, D is Procedural. Procedural memory is a subset of implicit, right? It's the memory for how to do things. So maybe both C and D are possibilities.

But the question is about when their memory is tested. I think procedural memory tests would involve tasks like riding a bike or solving a puzzle they've done before. Older adults might perform well because that's implicit.

Alternatively, I remember reading that older adults do better on implicit memory tests than explicit ones. So the answer would be C: Implicit.

Wait, another angle: working memory, which is option F, that's more about holding and manipulating information, like mental calculation. I think working memory does decline with age, so F is not the answer.

Episodic memory, which is part of explicit, is about events. That tends to decline, so G is out. Semantic memory is factual knowledge, which is also explicit. I think semantic can be more stable than episodic, but maybe not as good as implicit. So E is semantic, H is explicit, which includes semantic and episodic. So if the question is about doing well, maybe semantic is better preserved than episodic but implicit is better.

Wait, the options include both C (implicit) and D (procedural). So which one is it? The question says "tested"â€”so when tested on implicit memory tasks, they perform well. Procedural is a type of implicit, but the broader category is implicit. So the answer would be C.

Alternatively, if the question is about which memory is tested and they perform well, like in everyday situations, it's more about implicit. So I'm leaning towards C.

Older adults generally perform very well when their **implicit** memory is tested. Implicit memory refers to unconscious, automatic memories, such as skills and habits, which are less affected by aging compared to explicit memory, which involves conscious recall of events or facts. Procedural memory, a subset of implicit memory, also remains intact, but the broader category of implicit memory is the most accurate answer here.

Answer: C
