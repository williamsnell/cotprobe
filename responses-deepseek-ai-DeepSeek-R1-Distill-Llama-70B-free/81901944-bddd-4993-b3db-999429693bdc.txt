Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"Purusa-Sukta"
Purusa is the lord of the immortals, who grow by means of [ritual] food. When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.
It was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.
When they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.

Okay, so I have this question about the caste system in ancient India and which option would contradict the idea that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles between 600 BCE and 600 CE. Hmm, I need to think carefully.

The question refers to the Purusa-Sukta from the Rig Veda, which describes the origin of the caste system. From what I remember, the Purusa-Sukta says that the different varnas (classes) were created from different parts of Purusa's body during a sacrifice. So Brahmins from the mouth, Kshatriyas from the arms, Vaishyas from the thighs, and Shudras from the feet. This suggests a divine and rigid hierarchy.

The argument the question is about is that the caste system was rigid in terms of economic and social roles during that period. So the question is asking which option would contradict that argument. That means I'm looking for an option that shows flexibility or challenges the rigid structure.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The Bhagavad Gita says one's duty is determined by caste. That supports the rigid system, not contradicts it.

Option B: Brahmins had the highest status as priests. Again, supports the hierarchy, not contradicting.

Option C: Sudras as servants. Also supports rigid roles.

Option D: Rig Veda depicts caste as divine order. This supports the idea, so it doesn't contradict.

Option E: Ramayana written by a prince. Wait, Valmiki wrote the Ramayana, and he was a sage, not necessarily a prince. But this fact, if true, might not directly relate to caste rigidity. Maybe if a person from a lower caste wrote it, that would challenge, but a prince is Kshatriya, so maybe not.

Option F: Kshatriya's duty is righteous battle. This is from the Bhagavad Gita, supporting the caste duties, so not a contradiction.

Option G: Composer of Mahabharata was born to a fisherwoman. Wait, Vyasa is credited with composing the Mahabharata. If he was born to a fisherwoman, who would be Shudra, that could indicate that someone from a lower caste could achieve a high status or role, which would contradict the rigid system.

Option H: Four divisions created by Krishna. This supports the divine origin, so it's not a contradiction.

Option I: Shiva's roles as creator, preserver, destroyer. Doesn't relate to caste system rigidity.

Option J: Manusmriti says caste is divinely sanctioned. Supports the argument, so not a contradiction.

So the options that could contradict are E and G. Let me think again. Option G says the composer was born to a fisherwoman. If that's true, then someone from a lower caste (Shudra) could compose a major epic, which would show that the caste system wasn't so rigid that it prevented lower castes from achieving prominence in certain fields. That would contradict the argument that the system imposed rigid roles.

Option E, if the Ramayana was written by a prince (Kshatriya), that doesn't really challenge the caste system; it's consistent with their role. So Option G seems better as a contradiction.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if the Mahabharata's composer was indeed born to a fisherwoman. I think Vyasa was a sage, but maybe his birth circumstances were humble? Some stories say he was the son of a fisherwoman, which would make him a Shudra by birth. If that's the case, then his role as a great composer would challenge the rigid caste roles.

So the correct answer would be G, as it shows someone from a lower caste achieving a high position, thus contradicting the rigid system.

To determine which option best contradicts the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles in ancient India (600 BCE to 600 CE), we analyze the options in light of the Purusa-Sukta, which describes the caste system as a divine hierarchy with fixed roles.

- **Option A**: Supports the rigid caste system by linking duty to caste.
- **Option B**: Reinforces the hierarchy by emphasizing Brahmins' high status.
- **Option C**: Aligns with the rigid system by describing Sudras as servants.
- **Option D**: Affirms the divine origin of the caste system, supporting rigidity.
- **Option E**: Does not contradict the rigid system, as it is consistent with a Kshatriya prince writing the Ramayana.
- **Option F**: Supports caste-based duties, consistent with rigidity.
- **Option G**: Suggests that Vyasa, the composer of the Mahabharata, was born to a fisherwoman (Shudra), implying that someone from a lower caste could achieve prominence. This directly challenges the rigid caste system.
- **Option H**: Reinforces the divine creation of caste divisions.
- **Option I**: Unrelated to the caste system's rigidity.
- **Option J**: Supports the divine sanction of the caste system.

Option G stands out as the best contradiction because it highlights flexibility within the caste system, showing that individuals from lower castes could achieve significant roles, thereby challenging the idea of rigid social and economic roles.

Answer: G
