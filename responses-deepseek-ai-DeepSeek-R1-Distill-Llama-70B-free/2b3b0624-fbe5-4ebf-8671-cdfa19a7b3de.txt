Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The problem says that for any positive integer n, ⟨n⟩ denotes the closest integer to the square root of n. Then I need to evaluate the sum from n=1 to infinity of (2^{⟨n⟩} + 2^{-⟨n⟩}) divided by 2^n. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, okay. So the first step is to understand what ⟨n⟩ is. It's the closest integer to sqrt(n). So for each n, I take the square root and round it to the nearest integer. For example, when n is a perfect square, like n=1, 4, 9, etc., the square root is an integer, so ⟨n⟩ is exactly that integer. But for numbers between perfect squares, I have to see which integer is closer.

Let me try a few examples. For n=2, sqrt(2) is about 1.414, so the closest integer is 1. For n=3, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so closer to 2. Wait, no, 1.732 is closer to 2? Wait, 1.732 is 0.732 away from 2 and 0.268 away from 1. Wait no, wait: 1.732 -1 is 0.732, and 2 -1.732 is 0.268. Oh wait, that's the other way around. Oh wait, no, no, wait. 1.732 is between 1 and 2. The distance to 1 is 0.732, and the distance to 2 is 0.268. So actually, 1.732 is closer to 2. So ⟨3⟩ is 2. Hmm, okay, that's a bit tricky.

Wait, so let's think about how to partition the integers n based on ⟨n⟩. For each integer k, what are the values of n where ⟨n⟩ =k? So for each k, the values of n where the closest integer to sqrt(n) is k.

I remember that for a given integer k, the numbers n where sqrt(n) is between k-0.5 and k+0.5 will round to k. Because if sqrt(n) is exactly halfway between k and k+1, that's when it's k+0.5. So for example, the range for ⟨n⟩=k is when sqrt(n) is in [k-0.5, k+0.5).

So to find the range of n for each k, I can square those bounds. So n must be in [ (k-0.5)^2 , (k+0.5)^2 ). Since n is an integer, the lower bound is the ceiling of (k-0.5)^2 and the upper bound is the floor of (k+0.5)^2 minus one, maybe? Let me check.

Let's calculate (k-0.5)^2 and (k+0.5)^2. For example, when k=1:

(k-0.5)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25

(k+0.5)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25

So n must be >= 1 (since n starts at 1) and < 2.25. So n=1, 2. So for k=1, n ranges from 1 to 2 inclusive.

Wait, wait. Wait, (k-0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (k+0.5)^2 is 2.25. So the range of sqrt(n) is from 0.25 to 2.25, so n is from 0.25^2=0.0625 to 2.25^2=5.0625. Wait, no, wait, that's not correct. Wait, n is from (k-0.5)^2 to (k+0.5)^2. So for k=1, it's from 0.25 to 2.25. So n can be 1, 2 because 0.25 < n < 2.25. So n=1 and 2.

Wait, but n=3 is 3, sqrt(3)=1.732, which is 1.732. Wait, but in the case of k=1, the upper limit is (1.5)^2=2.25, so sqrt(n) has to be less than 2.25. So n=3 is 3, which is less than 2.25? No, 3 is greater than 2.25. Wait, no, wait, (k+0.5)^2 for k=1 is 2.25. So sqrt(n) must be less than 2.25, so n must be less than (2.25)^2=5.0625. So n can be up to 5.

Wait, wait, I think I'm confusing myself.

Wait, for a given k, the numbers n where sqrt(n) is in [k-0.5, k+0.5) will have ⟨n⟩=k. So for example, k=1: sqrt(n) must be >= 0.5 and < 1.5. So n must be >= (0.5)^2=0.25 and < (1.5)^2=2.25. So n=1, 2.

k=2: sqrt(n) in [1.5, 2.5). So n is in [ (1.5)^2, (2.5)^2 ) = [2.25, 6.25). So n=3,4,5,6.

k=3: sqrt(n) in [2.5,3.5). So n in [6.25, 12.25). So n=7,8,9,10,11,12.

Wait, let me check for k=2. The lower bound is 1.5^2=2.25, so the smallest integer n is 3. The upper bound is 2.5^2=6.25, so the largest n is 6.

Similarly, for k=3, the lower bound is 2.5^2=6.25, so n starts at 7. The upper bound is 3.5^2=12.25, so n goes up to 12.

So the numbers for each k are:

k=1: n=1,2 → 2 numbers.

k=2: n=3,4,5,6 →4 numbers.

k=3: n=7-12 →6 numbers.

k=4: n=13-20 →8 numbers.

I see a pattern here. For each k, the number of terms is 2k. Because for k=1, 2 terms; k=2, 4 terms; k=3,6 terms; etc. So the number of n's for each k is 2k.

Wait, let me confirm that. For k, the lower bound is (k-0.5)^2 and upper is (k+0.5)^2. So the number of integers n is floor((k+0.5)^2 -1) - floor((k-0.5)^2) + 1.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute (k+0.5)^2 - (k-0.5)^2. That would give the length of the interval for sqrt(n), and since sqrt(n) increases by 1 each time n increases by 2k+1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the number of terms is ( (k+0.5)^2 - (k-0.5)^2 ) = (k^2 +k +0.25) - (k^2 -k +0.25) )= 2k. So the number of n's for each k is 2k. So for k=1, 2 terms; k=2,4 terms; etc.

So, each k corresponds to 2k values of n. So when summing over n, I can group terms by k, each group having 2k terms, each with the same value of ⟨n⟩=k.

So the sum becomes sum_{k=1 to ∞} [ (2^k + 2^{-k}) / 2^n ] summed over 2k terms for each k. Wait, no, because each term is (2^k + 2^{-k}) divided by 2^n, and for each k, there are 2k terms, each with n varying within a certain range. So perhaps the sum can be expressed as sum_{k=1}^∞ (2^k + 2^{-k}) * (sum_{n in group k} 1/2^n).

So for each k, I can compute the sum of 1/2^n for n in the group, then multiply by (2^k + 2^{-k}).

So the overall sum is sum_{k=1}^∞ (2^k + 2^{-k}) * S_k, where S_k is the sum of 1/2^n for n in group k.

So I need to find S_k for each k. Let's figure out what S_k is.

For group k, the n's range from (k-0.5)^2 to (k+0.5)^2 -1, but since n is integer, the starting n is m = floor( (k-0.5)^2 ) + 1, and ending at M = floor( (k+0.5)^2 - ε ), where ε is a tiny positive number to make it not inclusive.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for each k, the starting n is (k-0.5)^2 + 1? No, wait.

Wait, for k=1: (1-0.5)^2 = 0.25, so the first n is 1. The last n is (1.5)^2 -1 = 2.25 -1? Wait, no, earlier I saw that for k=1, n goes up to 2.

Wait, perhaps for group k, the starting n is (k-0.5)^2 +1? Or maybe (k-0.5)^2 is the lower bound, but since n must be integer, the starting n is floor( (k-0.5)^2 ) +1.

Wait, let me think numerically. For k=1:

(k-0.5)^2 = 0.25, so the starting n is 1.

(k+0.5)^2 = 2.25, so the ending n is 2 (since 2.25 is the upper limit, so n can be up to 2).

Thus, for k=1, n=1 and 2. So the sum S_1 is 1/2^1 + 1/2^2 = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4.

Similarly, for k=2, n runs from 3 to 6. So S_2 = 1/2^3 + 1/2^4 + 1/2^5 + 1/2^6.

Which is 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 = (8 +4 +2 +1)/64 = 15/64.

Wait, wait: 1/8 is 8/64, 1/16 is 4/64, 1/32 is 2/64, and 1/64 is 1/64. So total is 15/64.

Similarly, for k=3, n runs from 7 to 12. So S_3 = sum from n=7 to 12 of 1/2^n.

That's 1/128 + 1/256 + ... up to 1/4096? Wait, no, wait: 2^7=128, so 1/128 is 1/(2^7), etc. So S_3 would be sum from m=7 to 12 of 1/2^m.

I can compute that as the sum of a geometric series. The sum from m=a to m=b of 1/2^m is equal to (1/2^a - 1/2^{b+1}) ) / (1 - 1/2) ) = 2*(1/2^a - 1/2^{b+1}).

So for k=1, a=1, b=2: sum = (1/2^1 -1/2^3)*2 = (1/2 - 1/8)*2 = (3/8)*2 = 3/4.

Which matches what I had earlier.

Similarly, for k=2, a=3, b=6: sum = (1/8 - 1/128)*2 = (16/128 - 1/128)*2 = (15/128)*2=15/64.

For k=3, a=7, b=12: sum = (1/128 - 1/8192)*2 = (64/8192 - 1/8192)*2 = (63/8192)*2= 63/4096.

Wait, let me compute that again. 1/128 is 64/8192, and 1/8192 is 1/8192. So their difference is 63/8192. Multiply by 2: 126/8192 = 63/4096.

So S_k for each k is 2*(1/2^{(k-0.5)^2} - 1/2^{(k+0.5)^2} ) ?

Wait, no, wait. Because for group k, the starting n is the smallest integer greater than (k-0.5)^2, which is m = floor((k-0.5)^2) + 1. Similarly, the ending n is the largest integer less than (k+0.5)^2, which is M = floor((k+0.5)^2 - ε).

But computing this for each k might be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the S_k terms.

Wait, for k=1, S_1 = 3/4 = (2^{2} -1)/2^{2*1} )

Wait, 3/4 is (4-1)/4 = 3/4. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's think about S_k as the sum of 2k terms, each being 1/2^n, where n starts at (k-0.5)^2 +1 and ends at (k+0.5)^2 -1.

But perhaps another approach is to notice that the sum over n in group k of 1/2^n is equal to (sum from n=a to b of 1/2^n) where a = (k-0.5)^2 and b=(k+0.5)^2 -1. But since a and b are not integers, perhaps the starting n is the ceiling of (k-0.5)^2 and ending at floor( (k+0.5)^2 - ε ). But maybe it's easier to think of it in terms of the starting and ending points.

Wait, perhaps the sum S_k can be written as (1/2^{ceil( (k-0.5)^2 )}) ) * (1 - (1/2)^{2k}) / (1 - 1/2) )

Wait, because each group has 2k terms, so the sum is a geometric series with first term 1/2^{a}, where a is the first n in group k, and ratio 1/2, for 2k terms. So sum = (1/2^{a}) * (1 - (1/2)^{2k}) ) / (1 - 1/2) ) = (1/2^{a}) * (1 - 1/2^{2k}) ) * 2.

But I'm not sure if this is helpful yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express S_k in terms of (k-0.5)^2 and (k+0.5)^2.

Wait, for group k, the first n is (k-0.5)^2 + 1? No, because (k-0.5)^2 is not necessarily an integer. For example, when k=1, (1-0.5)^2=0.25, so the first n is 1. For k=2, (2-0.5)^2=2.25, so first n is 3. For k=3, (3-0.5)^2=6.25, so first n is 7.

So in general, the first n in group k is (k-0.5)^2 + 0.75? Wait, no, wait. Wait, (k-0.5)^2 is, for integer k, a number that ends with 0.25 if k is odd, and 0.25 as well. For example, k=1: 0.25, k=2: 2.25, k=3:6.25. So the next integer is (k-0.5)^2 + 0.75, which gives 1,3,7, etc., which matches the starting n's.

So the starting n for group k is (k-0.5)^2 + 0.75. But since n must be integer, perhaps n starts at m = floor( (k-0.5)^2 ) + 1.

Wait, let me see for k=1: (1-0.5)^2=0.25, so floor(0.25)=0, so m=1.

k=2: (2-0.5)^2=2.25, floor(2.25)=2, m=3.

k=3: (3-0.5)^2=6.25, floor is 6, m=7.

Yes, correct. So the starting n is m = floor( (k-0.5)^2 ) + 1.

Similarly, the ending n is M = floor( (k+0.5)^2 - ε ), where ε is a small positive number to make it not inclusive. So for k=1, (1.5)^2=2.25, so floor(2.25 - ε)=2.

Similarly, for k=2, (2.5)^2=6.25, so M=6.

So the number of terms is M - m +1. For k=1: 2-1+1=2 terms. For k=2:6-3+1=4 terms. For k=3:12-7+1=6 terms
