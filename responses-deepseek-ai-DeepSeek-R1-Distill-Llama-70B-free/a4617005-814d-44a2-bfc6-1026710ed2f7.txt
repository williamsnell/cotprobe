Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the change in enthalpy when 1 lbm of oxygen is heated from 500 R to 2000 R, and also finding the average specific heat for the process. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Hmm, I remember that the change in enthalpy (ΔH) is calculated using the formula ΔH = m * c_p * ΔT, where m is mass, c_p is the specific heat at constant pressure, and ΔT is the change in temperature. Since we're dealing with oxygen, I think I need to know the specific heat of oxygen. But wait, specific heat can vary with temperature, right? Oh, right, but if the problem gives us the average specific heat, or if we can assume a constant value over the temperature range.

Wait, the question also asks for the average specific heat. Oh, so maybe I'm supposed to calculate it. Or perhaps the problem expects me to use a known value for c_p of oxygen. Let me think.

I recall that for diatomic gases like oxygen, the specific heat at constant pressure (c_p) is around 0.24 to 0.25 Btu/lbm·°R. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me try to remember or figure out the exact value. Oh wait, specific heat can depend on whether it's at constant pressure or volume. Here, since we're talking about enthalpy, which is a constant pressure process, c_p is the right one.

So for oxygen, I think the molar mass is about 32 lbm per lbmol (since O2 is 32 g/mol, and using lbm units here). Wait, but specific heat is per unit mass. Let me double-check. Oh right, the specific heat of oxygen is about 0.219 Btu/lbm·°R at low temperatures, but it increases with temperature. But wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the specific heat of oxygen at different temperatures, or perhaps assume it's constant over the given range for simplicity.

Alternatively, if the problem gives us the average specific heat as part of the options, maybe I can compute it from the given data. Wait, no, the problem asks us to calculate it, so perhaps I need to find c_p_avg.

Wait, the problem gives the initial and final temperatures: 500 R to 2000 R. So the change in temperature ΔT is 2000 - 500 = 1500 R.

The formula for enthalpy change is ΔH = m * c_p_avg * ΔT. Since m is 1 lbm, ΔH would just be c_p_avg * 1500.

Looking at the options, each option gives a ΔH and a c_p. So for each option, I can check if ΔH = c_p * 1500.

Let me check each option.

Option A: ΔH = 366 Btu/lbm, c_p =0.244. So 0.244 *1500 = 366. Yes, that adds up.

Option B: 390 = 0.250 *1500 → 0.25*1500=375, which doesn't match 390. So option B's numbers don't align.

Option C: 350 = 0.230 *1500 → 0.23*1500=345. Close but not exact. So not matching.

Option D: 380 = 0.260*1500 → 0.26*1500=390. No, 390≠380. Doesn't match.

So from this, only option A has ΔH equal to c_p * 1500. So that suggests that option A is correct.

But wait, I thought the specific heat of oxygen is around 0.24-0.25. So 0.244 makes sense. So the calculations in option A fit.

So the correct answer should be A. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another approach: calculate the specific heat using the enthalpy change.

ΔH = 366 Btu/lbm for 1 lbm → 366 Btu.

ΔT =1500 R.

c_p_avg = ΔH / (m ΔT) → 366 / (1 *1500) = 0.244 Btu/lbm·°R.

Yes, that's correct.

To calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) as 1 lbm of oxygen is heated from 500 R to 2000 R, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta H = m \cdot c_p \cdot \Delta T
\]

Here:
- \( m = 1 \, \text{lbm} \),
- \( \Delta T = 2000 - 500 = 1500 \, \text{R} \),
- \( c_p \) is the average specific heat at constant pressure.

The problem also asks for the average specific heat (\( c_p \)) for the process. To solve this, we analyze the given options, where each option provides a value for \( \Delta H \) and \( c_p \). For each option, we check if \( \Delta H = c_p \cdot 1500 \), ensuring consistency between the two values.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   \( \Delta H = 366 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \), \( c_p = 0.244 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \cdot \text{R} \)  
   \( 0.244 \cdot 1500 = 366 \), which is consistent.

2. **Option B**:  
   \( \Delta H = 390 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \), \( c_p = 0.250 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \cdot \text{R} \)  
   \( 0.250 \cdot 1500 = 375 \), which does not match \( \Delta H = 390 \).

3. **Option C**:  
   \( \Delta H = 350 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \), \( c_p = 0.230 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \cdot \text{R} \)  
   \( 0.230 \cdot 1500 = 345 \), which does not match \( \Delta H = 350 \).

4. **Option D**:  
   \( \Delta H = 380 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \), \( c_p = 0.260 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \cdot \text{R} \)  
   \( 0.260 \cdot 1500 = 390 \), which does not match \( \Delta H = 380 \).

### Conclusion:
Only **Option A** satisfies the condition \( \Delta H = c_p \cdot 1500 \), with \( \Delta H = 366 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \) and \( c_p = 0.244 \, \text{Btu/lbm} \cdot \text{R} \). Additionally, \( c_p = 0.244 \) is reasonable for oxygen, as its specific heat typically ranges from 0.24 to 0.25 \( \text{Btu/lbm} \cdot \text{R} \).
