Okay, so I've got this question about electric displacement current. Hmm, I remember that displacement current has something to do with changing electric fields, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

Wait, displacement current was introduced by Maxwell, right? Oh yeah, he added it to Ampère's Law to make it consistent. Before Maxwell, Ampère's Law was for magnetostatic fields, but Maxwell noticed that it didn't account for time-varying electric fields.

So Ampère's Law originally related the magnetic field B to the current density J. But when electric fields change, like in a capacitor, even if the current is steady, the electric field changes, which should produce a magnetic field. So Maxwell added a term for the displacement current.

The displacement current density J_d is equal to the permittivity epsilon_0 times the rate of change of the electric field E. Mathematically, J_d = ε₀ * dE/dt. 

Now, the question is about the electric displacement current through a surface S. Currents are integrated over a surface, so the displacement current I_d would be the integral of J_d over S. That means I_d is proportional to the rate of change of the electric flux through S. Because electric flux Φ_E is the integral of E over S, so dΦ_E/dt would be the rate of change.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says rate of change of magnetic flux. No, that's more related to Faraday's Law and induced electric fields, not displacement current. Option B is electric flux, but it's not the rate. Option C is rate of change of electric current, which sounds like how regular current changes, but displacement current is about E-field changes. Option E is the rate of change of electric flux, which matches what I was thinking. 

So the answer should be E.

The electric displacement current through a surface \( S \) is a concept introduced by Maxwell to account for the magnetic effects of time-varying electric fields. It is defined as being proportional to the rate of change of the electric flux through \( S \). This is because the displacement current density \( \mathbf{J}_d \) is given by \( \mathbf{J}_d = \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \), and the total displacement current \( I_d \) is the integral of \( \mathbf{J}_d \) over the surface \( S \). Since the electric flux \( \Phi_E \) is the integral of \( \mathbf{E} \) over \( S \), the displacement current is proportional to \( \frac{\partial \Phi_E}{\partial t} \), the rate of change of the electric flux.

Analyzing the options:
- **A** refers to the rate of change of magnetic flux, which is related to Faraday's Law, not displacement current.
- **B** refers to the electric flux itself, not its rate of change.
- **C** refers to the rate of change of electric current, which is unrelated to displacement current.
- **E** correctly identifies the rate of change of the electric flux, which matches the definition of displacement current.
- The other options (D, F, G, H, I, J) are unrelated to the definition of displacement current.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**E**

Answer: E
