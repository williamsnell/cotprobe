Okay, so I have this question about bonds and their face value. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. Alright, the question says a bond yields 5% interest and pays annual interest of $2.50. I need to find the face value of the bond from the options given.

Wait, I remember that the interest a bond pays is usually a percentage of its face value. Oh right, the formula should be something like Interest = (Face Value * Rate) / Time. Oh wait, but since it's annual, time is 1 year, so the formula simplifies to Interest = Face Value * Rate. 

So the interest paid is $2.50, and the rate is 5%. Let me write that down. So, $2.50 = Face Value * 5%. But wait, 5% is like 0.05 in decimal. So rearranging the formula, Face Value = Interest / Rate. 

Plugging in the numbers, Face Value = 2.50 / 0.05. Let me calculate that. 2.50 divided by 0.05... Hmm, dividing by 0.05 is the same as multiplying by 20, right? Because 1/0.05 is 20. So 2.50 * 20 equals 50. So the face value should be $50. 

Looking at the options, option D is $50. So the answer must be D. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If the face value is $50 and the rate is 5%, then 5% of 50 is indeed 2.50. Yeah, that makes sense.

The bond's annual interest is calculated as 5% of its face value. Using the formula:

\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Face Value} \times \text{Rate}
\]

Given that the interest is $2.50 and the rate is 0.05 (5% in decimal), rearranging the formula gives:

\[
\text{Face Value} = \frac{\text{Interest}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{2.50}{0.05} = 50
\]

Thus, the face value of the bond is $50, which corresponds to option D.
