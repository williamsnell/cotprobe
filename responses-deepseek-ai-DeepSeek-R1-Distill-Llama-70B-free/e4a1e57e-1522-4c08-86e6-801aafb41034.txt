Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We have a sample of 3.00 moles of a diatomic perfect gas. It's initially at 200 K, and it's compressed reversibly and adiabatically until its temperature reaches 250 K. We're given the molar heat capacity at constant volume, Cv,m, as 27.5 J K^-1 mol^-1. The question is to calculate q, which I remember is the heat absorbed by the system.

Hmm, right. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I remember that in thermodynamics, different processes have different implications for heat, work, and internal energy.

Adiabatic processes are those where no heat is exchanged with the surroundings, right? So q should be zero. But wait, wait. Let me think. Oh yeah, in an adiabatic process, by definition, q=0 because it's a thermally insulated system. So the system doesn't exchange heat with the surroundings. So that's the key here.

But wait, just to make sure I'm not making a mistake. The process is reversible and adiabatic. For an adiabatic process, regardless of whether it's reversible or irreversible, the heat transfer q is zero. So regardless of the other details, like the number of moles, the initial and final temperatures, the Cv, etc., q must be zero.

So looking at the options, option A is 0 J. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe the problem is a trick question, but I don't think so. Let me think again about what happens in an adiabatic process. The first law of thermodynamics says that delta U equals q plus w. But in an adiabatic process, q is zero, so delta U equals w. But that's about the internal energy and the work done. But regardless, the value of q is zero.

So yeah, the correct answer is A: 0.

In an adiabatic process, by definition, there is no heat exchange between the system and its surroundings. This means that the heat transfer, \( q \), is zero. The problem explicitly states that the compression is adiabatic, so regardless of other details such as the number of moles, initial and final temperatures, or the heat capacity \( C_{V,m} \), the value of \( q \) remains zero.

Thus, the correct answer is:

A: 0

Answer: A
