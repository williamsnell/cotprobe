Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about two statements related to entropy and graph moralization. I'm a bit rusty on these topics, but I'll try to work through each statement step by step.

Starting with Statement 1: "For any two variables x and y having joint distribution p(x, y), we always have H[x, y] ≥ H[x] + H[y] where H is the entropy function." Hmm, I remember that entropy measures uncertainty. Joint entropy H(x,y) is the uncertainty about both x and y together. I think about the entropy formula: H(x,y) = -Σ p(x,y) log p(x,y). 

Wait, I recall that entropy has a property involving joint entropy and individual entropies. Oh right, there's the inequality H(x) + H(y) ≥ H(x,y). Or was it the other way around? Wait, no—I think it's the other way. Let me think: When you have two variables, their joint entropy can't be greater than the sum of their individual entropies. Or is it the opposite?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think of a simple example. Suppose x and y are independent. Then H(x,y) = H(x) + H(y). So the statement says H(x,y) ≥ H(x)+H(y), which would hold as equality in the independent case. But what if they are dependent?

If x and y are dependent, say if knowing x gives information about y, then their joint entropy would be less than the sum of their individual entropies. Because when variables are dependent, the uncertainty about both is less than just adding each's uncertainty. So H(x,y) ≤ H(x) + H(y). Oh wait, that's the opposite of what Statement 1 says. So Statement 1 claims that H(x,y) is greater than or equal to the sum, but actually, it's less than or equal. So Statement 1 must be false.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula. The joint entropy H(x,y) is the entropy of the joint distribution. The inequality I remember is H(x) + H(y) ≥ H(x,y), which holds because mutual information is non-negative. Because mutual information I(x;y) = H(x) + H(y) - H(x,y) ≥ 0. So yes, that makes H(x,y) ≤ H(x) + H(y). So Statement 1 is incorrect; it's false.

Now moving to Statement 2: "For some directed graphs, moralization decreases the number of edges present in the graph." I'm a bit fuzzy on what moralization means. From what I remember, moralization is a process used in converting a directed acyclic graph (DAG) into an undirected graph by adding edges between nodes that have a common child. The process involves:

1. For every node, draw edges between all pairs of its parents in the DAG. This is called moralizing the graph.
2. Then, drop the directions of the edges to make it undirected.

So moralization can add edges. For example, if a node has two parents, say A and B, that aren't connected in the original DAG, moralization would add an edge between A and B. So in that case, the number of edges increases.

But wait, the statement says that moralization decreases the number of edges. Does that ever happen? Hmm. Suppose the original graph already has all possible edges between parents. Then adding no new edges would mean the number remains the same. But I can't think of a case where moralization would reduce the number of edges. Because moralization adds edges between parents of each node, it can only increase or keep the same number of edges, not decrease.

Wait, another angle: the original graph might have more edges than after moralization. No, because moralization is adding edges, not removing. Unless... Wait, perhaps in some cases, the process of making the graph undirected could cause some edges to be removed if they were present in a certain way. No, I don't think so. Because when you moralize, you add edges between all pairs of parents for each node, and then make the graph undirected. So if the original graph had some edges that are not between parents, those edges would remain, and new edges are added. So the total number of edges can't decrease.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the process. Let me think again. The original graph is directed. When you moralize, you add edges (in the undirected sense) between all parents of each node, and then make all edges undirected. So the undirected moral graph has edges that include all the original edges (as undirected) plus the added edges between parents. Therefore, the number of edges can only increase or stay the same, not decrease. So Statement 2 says that for some directed graphs, moralization decreases edges. But according to this reasoning, it's impossible because moralization adds edges. So Statement 2 is false.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about a specific example. Suppose the original graph is a DAG where a node has two parents that are already connected. For example, node C has parents A and B, and there's already an edge between A and B. Then when you moralize, you add an edge between A and B again, but since it's undirected, it's the same edge. So no new edge is added. But in the process, you also convert the directed edges to undirected. So for each directed edge, you have an undirected edge. So in this case, if the original graph had, say, edges A->C, B->C, and A->B, then the moral graph would have edges A-B, A-C, B-C. The original directed graph had three edges (A->B, A->C, B->C), and the undirected graph has three edges as well. So the number remains the same.

But wait, the original graph is directed, so the undirected version would have edges A-B, A-C, B-C. So the undirected graph has three edges, same as the original directed graph's three edges (but directed). So in this case, the number of edges didn't change. But in cases where the parents weren't connected, the number increases.

But Statement 2 says that moralization decreases the number of edges. So in no case does it decrease. So Statement 2 is false. Therefore, both statements are false.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Moralization adds edges between parents, but the original graph's edges are converted to undirected. So for each original edge, you have an undirected edge. So if the original graph had N edges, the moral graph has at least N edges, possibly more.

So for Statement 2 to be true, moralization would have to result in fewer edges, which I don't think is possible. So Statement 2 is false.

So now, evaluating the two statements:

Statement 1: False (because H(x,y) ≤ H(x)+H(y)).

Statement 2: False (moralization cannot decrease the number of edges).

Looking at the options, the options are pairs of true/false for the two statements.

The options are:

A: T, F

B: F, Depends...

Wait, the options are about Statement 1 and Statement 2.

Looking at the options:

Option F is False, False.

So the correct answer would be option F.

Statement 1 claims that for any two variables \(x\) and \(y\) with joint distribution \(p(x, y)\), the inequality \(H[x, y] \geq H[x] + H[y]\) always holds, where \(H\) denotes entropy. However, this is incorrect. The correct relationship is \(H[x] + H[y] \geq H[x, y]\), which follows from the non-negativity of mutual information. Mutual information is defined as \(I(x; y) = H[x] + H[y] - H[x, y]\), and since \(I(x; y) \geq 0\), it implies that \(H[x, y] \leq H[x] + H[y]\). Therefore, Statement 1 is false.

Statement 2 asserts that for some directed graphs, moralization decreases the number of edges. Moralization is the process of converting a directed acyclic graph (DAG) into an undirected graph by adding edges between all pairs of parents for each node and then removing edge directions. This process can only increase or keep the number of edges the same, as it adds new edges between parents who were not previously connected. It cannot reduce the number of edges. Thus, Statement 2 is also false.

Given that both statements are false, the correct answer is:

**F: False, False**

Answer: F
