Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Bandura's social learning theory, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about the concept of self-reinforcement in Bandura's theory and how it explains the maintenance of learned behavior when there's no external reward. Hmm, I remember that Bandura built on Skinner's operant conditioning but added his own twists, especially with observation and self-regulation.

Wait, self-reinforcement. Right, self-reinforcement is when a person reinforces their own behavior. So instead of someone else giving a reward, the individual does it themselves. This must be important for sustaining behaviors over time, especially when external rewards aren't present.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: Peer pressure influences decision making. That's more about social influence rather than self-reinforcement. I don't think this is the right one.

Option B: Children can overcome the negative effects of poor models. Hmm, not quite sure. Self-reinforcement might help in maintaining positive behaviors, but overcoming poor models sounds like maybe something else, like having better role models.

Option C: Punishment can be avoided. Avoiding punishment is more about negative reinforcement, not self-reinforcement. So probably not C.

Option D: The impact of positive reinforcement is amplified. I'm not sure. If self-reinforcement is about internal rewards, maybe it's separate from external positive reinforcement. So D might not be it.

Option E: Learned behavior is maintained over time. Oh, this sounds right. Because if there's no external reward, the person uses self-reinforcement to keep performing the behavior. So E fits.

Option F: Rival responses are acquired. That term is new to me. I think rival responses are when a new behavior competes with an existing one. Not directly related to self-reinforcement, I think.

Option G: Children can learn to mimic adult behavior. That's more about observation and imitation, which is part of social learning, but not specifically about self-reinforcement.

Option H: Children learn to differentiate right and wrong. That's more about moral development, maybe Kohlberg's stages or something. Not directly tied to self-reinforcement.

Option I: Children imitate without understanding. Again, that's about imitation, which is part of social learning, but not self-reinforcement.

Option J: Socially appropriate behavior learned without models. That doesn't seem right because models are a key part of social learning. Self-reinforcement would help maintain behaviors learned from models when the model isn't present.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be E: learned behavior is maintained over time. Self-reinforcement explains how, without external rewards, the behavior continues because the individual internally reinforces it.

In Bandura's social learning theory, self-reinforcement refers to the process where individuals internally reward themselves for desired behaviors, enabling the maintenance of these behaviors even in the absence of external rewards. This concept is crucial for explaining how learned behaviors persist over time without external reinforcement.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Peer pressure is about social influence, not self-reinforcement.
- **B**: Overcoming poor models isn't directly tied to self-reinforcement.
- **C**: Avoiding punishment relates to negative reinforcement, not self-reinforcement.
- **D**: Amplifying positive reinforcement doesn't align with self-reinforcement.
- **E**: This fits, as self-reinforcement explains how behaviors are maintained over time without external rewards.
- **F**: Rival responses aren't relevant to self-reinforcement.
- **G**: Mimicking adult behavior is about imitation, not self-reinforcement.
- **H**: Differentiating right and wrong pertains to moral development, not self-reinforcement.
- **I**: Imitation without understanding is part of social learning but not self-reinforcement.
- **J**: Learning without models contradicts the role of models in social learning.

The correct answer is **E**, as self-reinforcement explains the maintenance of learned behavior over time in the absence of external rewards.

Answer: E
