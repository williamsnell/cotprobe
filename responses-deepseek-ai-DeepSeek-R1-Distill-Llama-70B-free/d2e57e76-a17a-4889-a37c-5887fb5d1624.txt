Question:

A boy who is holding a suitcase stands in an elevator. The elevator has an acceleration A^\ding{217}, which may be directed upward (A^\ding{217}. positive) or downward (A^\ding{217} negative). What force does the suitcase exert on the boy's hand?

Options:

A: A/(mg)
B: m(g + A)
C: m(A/g)
D: mg/A
E: m(A - g)
F: m(g - A)
G: m(2g + A)
H: mg + A
I: A/mg
J: m(g/A)

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. So, there's a boy holding a suitcase in an elevator. The elevator's acceleration is A, which can be upward or downward. The question is asking what force the suitcase exerts on the boy's hand. Hmm, right.

Alright, so I remember that when you're dealing with forces in elevators, you have to consider the apparent weight. Oh wait, but this is the force exerted by the suitcase on the boy's hand, so that's actually the normal force the boy feels from the suitcase. Or wait, no, wait. The suitcase is in the boy's hand, so the force the suitcase exerts on his hand is basically the normal force from his hand on the suitcase, right? Newton's third law says they're equal and opposite.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. The boy's hand is exerting a force upward on the suitcase, so the suitcase exerts an equal and opposite force downward on his hand. So the force we're looking for is the force from the suitcase on the hand, which is the same as the apparent weight of the suitcase.

So, how do I find that? I think the formula for apparent weight is m(g + a), where 'a' is the acceleration of the elevator. But wait, I have to be careful with the direction. If the elevator is accelerating upward, 'a' is positive, and if it's accelerating downward, 'a' is negative.

So the apparent weight, which is the normal force (N) exerted by the floor (or in this case, the hand) on the suitcase, is N = m(g + a). But wait, in this problem, the acceleration is given as A. So substituting, N = m(g + A).

Wait, but the options are given with variables. Let me check the options. Option B is m(g + A), which matches what I just thought. But wait, what if the elevator is accelerating downward? Then A is negative, so the formula still holds because (g + A) would be less than g, which makes sense because the apparent weight decreases.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The boy is holding the suitcase, so the force the suitcase exerts on his hand is equal to the force his hand exerts on the suitcase. That's Newton's third law. So when the elevator accelerates, the suitcase's apparent weight changes.

So when the elevator accelerates upward, the apparent weight increases, so the force on the hand is greater. When it accelerates downward, the apparent weight decreases.

So the formula is correct, N = m(g + A). So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but what if the elevator is in free fall? Then A would be -g, so N becomes m(g -g) = 0, which makes sense because the suitcase would feel weightless. So yeah, that makes sense.

I think I've got it right then. The force is m(g + A), which is option B.

To determine the force the suitcase exerts on the boy's hand, we need to consider the apparent weight of the suitcase in the accelerating elevator. The apparent weight is given by the formula:

\[
N = m(g + A)
\]

where:
- \(m\) is the mass of the suitcase,
- \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity,
- \(A\) is the acceleration of the elevator (positive for upward and negative for downward).

This formula accounts for the change in the normal force due to the elevator's acceleration. When the elevator accelerates upward, the apparent weight increases, and when it accelerates downward, the apparent weight decreases. 

The force the suitcase exerts on the boy's hand is equal in magnitude to the normal force the boy's hand exerts on the suitcase, as per Newton's third law. Therefore, the force is \(m(g + A)\), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
