Question:

Tired after a long, hard day at school, Cyrus decides to take a nap. An hour later, his Dad wakes him to let him know it's time for dinner. Cyrus feels worse than when he went to bed and can hardly drag himself to the table. An EEG of Cyrus right before he was awoken would most likely have shown a preponderance of

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Cyrus and his nap. Let me think through it step by step. 

The question says Cyrus took a nap after a long day and was woken up an hour later. When he wakes up, he feels worse than when he went to bed and can't drag himself to dinner. The question is about what his EEG would show right before he was awoken.

Hmm, I remember that EEG measures different types of brain waves during different stages of sleep and wakefulness. The main types I know are delta, theta, alpha, beta, and maybe some others like gamma or sigma.

So first, I should think about the stages of sleep. Sleep is divided into REM and non-REM sleep, and non-REM has different stages. I think stage 1 is light sleep, easy to wake up, and stage 2 has sleep spindles. Stage 3 is deep sleep with delta waves. REM is where most dreams happen.

When you take a nap, the body goes through these stages. Now, if Cyrus napped for an hour and was woken up feeling groggy, that makes me think of sleep inertia. I remember that sleep inertia is that groggy feeling when you wake up from deep sleep. So if he was woken during deep sleep, he'd feel this way.

Deep sleep is stage 3 non-REM, which is characterized by delta waves. So the EEG before waking would show a lot of delta waves.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing this up. Are there other waves associated with other stages? Alpha waves are when you're relaxed but still awake, like before sleep. So probably not those. Beta waves are for active thinking or concentration, so not during sleep.

Theta waves are in early stages of sleep, like drowsiness. So stage 1 maybe. But if he's been asleep an hour, he's probably gone through the stages and into deeper sleep. Like, the sleep cycle is about 90 minutes, so an hour would put him maybe in stage 3 or early REM?

Wait, no. The first cycle is like 90 minutes, but after that, the cycles get shorter. Hmm, but an hour is shorter than a full cycle. So maybe he's in stage 3.

So right before waking, his brain would be in the deepest part of sleep, which is delta waves. So the EEG would show a lot of delta waves.

Looking at the options, G is delta waves. So the answer should be G.

The question revolves around determining the predominant brain wave type in Cyrus's EEG before he was awoken from his nap. Cyrus felt groggy upon waking, which suggests he was in a deep stage of sleep when awakened. Sleep is divided into REM and non-REM stages, with non-REM sleep further subdivided into stages. Stage 3 non-REM sleep is the deepest stage, characterized by delta waves, and waking from this stage often results in sleep inertia (grogginess). Since Cyrus was asleep for an hour, he likely reached this deep sleep stage. Therefore, his EEG would predominantly show delta waves.

G: delta waves.

Answer: G
