Question:

A ball of mass is attached to a string connected to the ceiling, forming a pendulum. When the string is raised to an angle of 50 degrees below the horizontal (the ceiling) and released, the ball swings back and forth with a period of 0.4 s. Which of the following changes to the pendulum would decrease the period of the pendulum?

Options:

A: Releasing the string from a higher point
B: Increasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released
C: Decreasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released
D: Decreasing the mass of the ball
E: Increasing the length of the string
F: Releasing the ball from a lower point
G: Decreasing the length of the string
H: Increasing the mass of the ball
I: Decreasing the gravity acting on the ball

Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about a pendulum. Hmm, I remember that a pendulum's period—the time it takes to swing back and forth—depends on a few factors. Let me think... Oh right, the formula for the period of a simple pendulum is T = 2π√(L/g), where L is the length of the string and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

Wait, the question is asking what change would decrease the period. So I need to find an option that would make T smaller. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Releasing the string from a higher point. Hmm, if you release it from a higher point, I think that would mean the string is longer because the ball is hanging lower. So L increases. But wait, the period depends on the square root of L. So increasing L would increase T, not decrease. So A would increase the period. So A is not the right choice.

Option B: Increasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released. Oh, right, the period formula I mentioned earlier assumes small angles where sinθ ≈ θ. But wait, the problem states that the initial angle is 50 degrees below the horizontal. Wait, 50 degrees is a pretty large angle. Does that affect the period? Oh, right. For larger angles, the period actually increases a bit because the restoring force isn't exactly as modeled by the simple formula. So if the angle is increased, the period would get longer. So B would make the period larger, not smaller. So B is not the answer.

Option C: Decreasing the angle of the string from the horizontal when released. Wait, so if the angle is smaller, like releasing from a lower point, does that affect the period? Wait, the period formula is T=2π√(L/g), which doesn't include the angle. Oh, but wait, that's only for small angles where the approximation holds. If you go to a smaller angle, the approximation is better, but does it change the period? Wait, no. Because the formula is still approximately the same. So if you decrease the angle, say from 50 to 30 degrees, the period remains about the same. So this change wouldn't significantly decrease the period. So C might not be the right choice.

Option D: Decreasing the mass of the ball. Oh, mass doesn't affect the period. The formula doesn't have mass in it. So D wouldn't change the period at all. So D isn't the answer.

Option E: Increasing the length of the string. That would increase L, which makes T larger. So E is not the answer.

Option F: Releasing the ball from a lower point. Wait, that would make the string shorter, right? Because the pendulum's length is from the pivot to the ball. If you release it from a lower point, maybe that changes how high it swings, but not the length. Or wait, no—if the string is connected to the ceiling and the ball is hanging down. If you release it from a lower point, perhaps the string is longer because it's hanging more. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The length L is fixed by where the string is attached. If you release it from a higher point, that might not change L. Wait, no—if the string's length is fixed, then releasing it from a different point (like higher or lower) would change the maximum height but not the length. Because L is the distance from the pivot to the bob. So if the string is the same length, but you pull it back more (higher angle), the initial height changes but L stays same. So F is about releasing from a lower point, which I think might mean the amplitude is smaller, but L is same. So the period wouldn't change. So F isn't the answer.

Option G: Decreasing the length of the string. Oh, that makes sense. Because T is proportional to the square root of L. So if L decreases, T decreases. So G would make the period smaller, which is what we want. So G is a candidate.

Option H: Increasing the mass of the ball. But mass isn't in the period formula, so H doesn't affect T. So H isn't the answer.

Option I: Decreasing the gravity acting on the ball. Well, in the formula, g is in the denominator under the square root. So if g decreases, T increases. Wait, no—if g decreases, then √(L/g) increases, making T longer. So I would increase the period, which is opposite of what we want. So I isn't the answer.

Wait, so looking at the options, G is the right choice. Decreasing the length of the string would decrease the period.

The period of a simple pendulum is given by the formula:

\[
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}
\]

where \(T\) is the period, \(L\) is the length of the string, and \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity. The problem asks which change would decrease the period. Let us analyze each option:

- **Option A:** Releasing the string from a higher point would increase the length \(L\), which increases \(T\). This does not decrease the period.  
- **Option B:** Increasing the angle of release increases the amplitude, which slightly increases the period for larger angles due to deviations from the small-angle approximation. This does not decrease the period.  
- **Option C:** Decreasing the angle of release improves the small-angle approximation but does not significantly change the period, as \(T\) depends on \(L\) and \(g\), not the angle. This does not decrease the period.  
- **Option D:** The mass of the ball does not appear in the formula for \(T\), so changing the mass has no effect on the period.  
- **Option E:** Increasing the length of the string increases \(L\), which increases \(T\). This does not decrease the period.  
- **Option F:** Releasing the ball from a lower point does not change the length \(L\), so it does not affect the period.  
- **Option G:** Decreasing the length of the string reduces \(L\), which decreases \(T\) because \(T\) is proportional to \(\sqrt{L}\). This decreases the period.  
- **Option H:** The mass of the ball does not affect the period, as it is not included in the formula.  
- **Option I:** Decreasing the gravity \(g\) increases \(T\), as \(T\) is inversely proportional to \(\sqrt{g}\). This does not decrease the period.

The correct answer is **G**, as decreasing the length of the string is the only change that reduces the period.

Answer: G
