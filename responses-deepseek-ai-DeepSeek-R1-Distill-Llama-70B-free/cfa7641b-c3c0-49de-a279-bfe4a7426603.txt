Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about consumer goods, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: "These goods are bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and involve a reasonably high level of consumer risk." And I have to choose the right option from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that consumer goods can be classified into different categories based on various factors like purchase frequency, usage, and risk involved. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the goods are bought infrequently. That means they're not something people purchase every day or regularly. So it's probably not something like staple goods (A) because staples are bought frequently, like food or toiletries. Similarly, impulse goods (E) are bought on the spot without much thought, but they're not necessarily infrequent. So maybe not E.

Next, these goods are used repeatedly. That suggests they are durable because they can withstand multiple uses over time. Durable goods (F) are items like cars, appliances, or furniture. Non-durable goods (G), on the other hand, are used up quickly or don't last long, like food or clothes. So F might be a candidate here.

The third point is a reasonably high level of consumer risk. High risk usually implies that the product is expensive or has a significant impact on the consumer's life. Think about high-involvement purchases. Examples might include cars, homes, or major appliances. These are big-ticket items where the consumer spends a lot of time and consideration before buying.

Let me think about each option again:

A: Staple goods – these are bought frequently, so probably not.

B: Specialty goods – these are specific products that people are willing to make an effort to purchase, like a specific brand. They might involve some risk, but I'm not sure if they fit all three criteria here.

C: Luxury goods – these are high-end items, bought infrequently, but do they involve high risk? Maybe, but I'm not certain. Also, not all luxury goods are durable, though they often are.

D: Perishable goods – these are used quickly and don't last, so they don't fit the 'used repeatedly' part.

E: Impulse goods – bought on impulse, so they're frequent but low risk.

F: Durable goods – bought infrequently, used repeatedly. Do they involve high risk? Well, yes, because they're often expensive. For example, a refrigerator is a durable good, bought once every decade or so, used daily, and involves risk because it's a significant investment.

G: Non-durable – as I thought earlier, no, because they're not used repeatedly.

H: Services – not goods, so probably not the answer here.

I: Unsought goods – these are things people don't think about until they need them, like insurance or funeral services. They might be bought infrequently and involve risk, but are they used repeatedly? Services aren't 'used' like goods are, so maybe not.

J: Complementary goods – these are used alongside other products, like batteries for a toy. Not sure about the risk factor here.

Putting it all together, the goods in question are bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and have high risk. That points towards durable goods, which are option F. They fit all three aspects: not bought often, last a long time (used repeatedly), and often involve higher risk because of their cost and importance.

The correct answer is F: Durable goods. These goods are bought infrequently, used repeatedly over time, and often involve a high level of consumer risk due to their cost and significance. 

Answer: F
