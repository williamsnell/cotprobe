Okay, so I've got this problem here about two gas-filled bulbs connected by a valve. Hmm, let me read it again. Alright, the setup is a 3-liter bulb with oxygen at 195 torr and a 2-liter bulb with nitrogen at 530 torr. They're connected by a closed valve, which is then opened. The gases equilibrate at a constant temperature T. I need to find the equilibrium pressure.

Wait, I remember something about gas laws when gases are allowed to mix. Oh right, when gases are connected and allowed to expand into each other, their pressures change based on their volumes. But wait, does the temperature affect this? Oh, the temperature is constant, so I think I can use Boyle's Law or maybe the combined gas law.

Wait, no, wait. Each gas will expand into the entire volume. Oh right, the total volume after opening the valve is 3 + 2 = 5 liters.

So for each gas, the pressure changes as they expand into the larger volume. Since the temperature is constant, the ideal gas law applies. PV = nRT, and since T is constant, P1V1 = P2V2 for each gas.

Let me think about each gas separately. For the oxygen first. Initial state: P1 = 195 torr, V1 = 3 L. After expansion, V becomes 5 L. So P2 = (P1 * V1) / V_total. So for O2, P2 = (195 * 3) /5. Let me calculate that. 195 *3 is 585, divided by 5 is 117 torr. So the partial pressure of O2 is 117 torr.

Then the nitrogen. Initial P1 = 530 torr, V1=2 L. After expansion, V is 5 L. So P2 = (530 * 2)/5 = 1060/5 = 212 torr. So N2's partial pressure is 212 torr.

The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures. So 117 + 212 = 329 torr. Wait, let me add again. 117 plus 200 is 317, plus 12 is 329. So total pressure is 329 torr.

Looking at the options, option E is 329 torr. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait a second. Are the gases reacting with each other? Like, is there any chemical reaction between oxygen and nitrogen? Oh, but in the problem statement, it's just about equilibration, not about any reactions. So no, they just mix as ideal gases. So my approach should be correct.

Alternative approach: Using the concept of partial pressures. Each gas expands into the combined volume, and their partial pressures add up.

Yes, so the steps I took are correct. So the equilibrium pressure is 329 torr.

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using the ideal gas law and the concept of partial pressures. When the valve is opened, the two gases expand into the total volume of 5 liters (3 liters + 2 liters) at constant temperature. The equilibrium pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of oxygen and nitrogen after expansion.

1. **For oxygen (O₂):**  
   Initial pressure, \( P_1 = 195 \, \text{torr} \), and initial volume, \( V_1 = 3 \, \text{L} \). After expansion, the volume becomes \( V_{\text{total}} = 5 \, \text{L} \). Using \( P_1V_1 = P_2V_2 \), the partial pressure of oxygen is:  
   \[
   P_{\text{O}_2} = \frac{P_1V_1}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{195 \times 3}{5} = 117 \, \text{torr}.
   \]

2. **For nitrogen (N₂):**  
   Initial pressure, \( P_1 = 530 \, \text{torr} \), and initial volume, \( V_1 = 2 \, \text{L} \). After expansion, the volume becomes \( V_{\text{total}} = 5 \, \text{L} \). Using \( P_1V_1 = P_2V_2 \), the partial pressure of nitrogen is:  
   \[
   P_{\text{N}_2} = \frac{P_1V_1}{V_{\text{total}}} = \frac{530 \times 2}{5} = 212 \, \text{torr}.
   \]

3. **Total equilibrium pressure:**  
   The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures:  
   \[
   P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{O}_2} + P_{\text{N}_2} = 117 + 212 = 329 \, \text{torr}.
   \]

From the given options, the correct answer is **E: 329 torr**.
