Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a photon striking an electron and creating an electron-positron pair. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says a photon hits an electron that's initially at rest. Then, the photon is destroyed, and the result is a positron and two electrons moving off at equal speeds in the same direction the photon was moving. I need to find the energy of the photon. The options are given as A through J, each representing a different multiple of mc².

Wait, okay, I remember that when particles are created, like in pair production, energy and momentum must be conserved. So that's the key here. Both energy and momentum have to be conserved in this reaction.

So the initial state is a photon and an electron at rest. The final state is two electrons and a positron. Oh wait, wait, wait. The initial electron is at rest, and after the collision, the positron and two electrons move off. Wait, no, I think in pair production, a photon creates an electron and a positron. But in this case, the photon is striking an existing electron, so maybe it's creating an additional pair. So the initial is the photon and the electron. The final is that electron plus the new electron and positron. Or wait, maybe the photon hits the electron, which then produces a positron and another electron? So now, there are two electrons and a positron? Or wait, no—wait, the initial is an electron, photon comes in, and then the result is the original electron, plus a new electron and positron. So three particles in total?

Wait, no, the problem states that the photon is destroyed, and the positron and two electrons move off. Hmm. But the initial electron was at rest. So the photon plus electron produces the original electron (maybe?), plus the new positron and another electron. So maybe the initial system is photon + electron, and the final is electron + electron + positron. So three particles.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem says the photon strikes an electron, creating an electron-positron pair. So the photon is destroyed, and the result is the original electron plus the new pair (electron and positron). So yeah, three particles: two electrons and a positron. Or wait, wait, the initial is photon and electron. The photon is destroyed, so the products are the original electron plus the new pair. So three particles: the original electron, the new electron, and the positron.

But okay, moving on. So the setup is that the photon has some energy E. The initial momentum is just that of the photon because the electron is at rest. The final momentum is the sum of the momenta of the two electrons and the positron.

Wait, but the problem says the positron and two electrons move off at equal speeds along the initial direction of the photon. Oh, so all three are moving in the same direction as the photon was moving. Wait, no, because the problem says that the two electrons and the positron move off at equal speeds. Are all three moving at the same speed in the same direction? That can't be right, because then their momenta would add up in the same direction. But the initial photon's momentum is in that same direction, so I guess that's possible.

Wait, but the initial electron is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The photon's momentum is E/c, because for a photon, p = E/c. So the initial momentum is E/c in the direction of the photon.

After the collision, the three particles (two electrons and a positron) are moving in the same direction. So their momenta are all in that direction. So the total momentum of the system after the collision must equal the initial momentum, which is E/c.

Wait, but in reality, creating particles would require some energy. So the photon's energy has to be sufficient to provide the rest mass energy of the new particles plus any kinetic energy they have.

So let's outline the steps:

1. Conservation of energy: The energy of the photon plus the rest energy of the initial electron must equal the total energy of the three particles (two electrons and a positron) after the collision.

2. Conservation of momentum: The momentum of the photon must equal the total momentum of the three particles after the collision.

Wait, but the initial electron is at rest, so its energy is just its rest energy, mc². So the total initial energy is E_photon + mc².

The final energy is the sum of the energies of the two electrons and the positron. Since all three are moving at the same speed, their energies will be their relativistic energies based on that speed.

Wait, but the positron has the same mass as the electron, so each of the three particles has mass m. So their rest energies are mc² each. So three particles would have a total rest energy of 3mc². But they also have kinetic energy because they're moving.

But the problem says they move off at equal speeds. Hmm. So each has the same speed, say v.

Wait, but electrons have charge, so their speeds would be non-relativistic? Or maybe relativistic? The problem doesn't specify, so I think we can proceed with relativistic calculations.

So each of the three particles (two electrons and a positron) has energy gamma * mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, since all three have the same speed, their gamma factors are the same.

So the total energy after the collision is 3 * gamma * mc².

Wait, but the initial energy is E_photon + mc². So E_photon + mc² = 3 gamma mc².

But then, the momentum. The initial momentum is E_photon / c (since for a photon, p = E/c). The final momentum is the sum of the momenta of the three particles.

Each particle's momentum is gamma m v, because p = gamma m v. Since all three have the same speed, their momenta add up. So total final momentum is 3 gamma m v.

So equating initial and final momentum:

E_photon / c = 3 gamma m v.

But from the energy equation:

E_photon = 3 gamma mc² - mc².

So substituting E_photon into the momentum equation:

(3 gamma mc² - mc²) / c = 3 gamma m v.

Simplify that:

(3 gamma m c² - m c²) / c = 3 gamma m v.

Factor out m c²:

m c² (3 gamma - 1) / c = 3 gamma m v.

Divide both sides by m:

c² (3 gamma - 1) / c = 3 gamma v.

Simplify c²/c to c:

c (3 gamma - 1) = 3 gamma v.

So,

v = [c (3 gamma - 1)] / (3 gamma).

Hmm. Now, let's relate gamma and v. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so v can also be expressed in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find v in terms of gamma and substitute.

Wait, let's express v in terms of gamma. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), we can square both sides:

gamma² = 1 / (1 - v²/c²)

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1/gamma²

So, v²/c² = 1 - 1/gamma²

Taking square roots,

v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²)

So v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²) = c * sqrt( (gamma² -1)/gamma² ) ) = (c/gamma) * sqrt(gamma² -1 )

Hmm. That's a bit complicated, but perhaps substituting into the equation for v would help.

So, from earlier:

v = [c (3 gamma - 1)] / (3 gamma )

Set this equal to the expression for v in terms of gamma:

[c (3 gamma -1 ) ] / (3 gamma ) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² )

Divide both sides by c:

(3 gamma -1 ) / (3 gamma ) = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma² )

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

[(3 gamma -1 ) / (3 gamma )]^2 = 1 - 1/gamma²

Expand the left side:

(9 gamma² -6 gamma +1 ) / (9 gamma² ) = 1 - 1/gamma².

Multiply both sides by 9 gamma² to eliminate denominators:

9 gamma² -6 gamma +1 = 9 gamma² (1 - 1/gamma² )

Simplify the right side:

9 gamma² *1 - 9 gamma² * (1/gamma² ) = 9 gamma² -9.

So the equation becomes:

9 gamma² -6 gamma +1 = 9 gamma² -9.

Subtract 9 gamma² from both sides:

-6 gamma +1 = -9

Then,

-6 gamma = -10 → 6 gamma =10 → gamma=10/6=5/3 ≈1.6667.

So gamma is 5/3. Now, let's find v from this.

Gamma is 5/3. So, using gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), we have:

sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 3/5 → 1 - v²/c² = 9/25 → v²/c² = 1 -9/25 =16/25 → v= (4/5)c.

So v= (4/5)c.

Now, let's go back to the energy equation. The initial energy is E_photon + mc²= 3 gamma mc².

So E_photon = 3 gamma mc² - mc².

Gamma is 5/3, so:

E_photon=3*(5/3) mc² - mc² =5 mc² - mc² =4 mc².

Wait, that would make the photon energy 4 mc². So looking at the options, option J is 4mc².

But wait, let me double-check. Because the initial energy is the photon's energy plus the electron's rest energy (mc²).

The final energy is three times gamma mc², because each of the three particles (two electrons and a positron) has energy gamma mc².

So with gamma=5/3,

3*(5/3)mc² =5 mc². So initial energy is E_photon + mc²=5 mc² → E_photon=4 mc².

So the photon energy is 4 mc². So the correct answer is J.
</think>

To solve the problem, we apply the principles of energy and momentum conservation. Initially, the system consists of a photon with energy \( E_{\text{photon}} \) and an electron at rest with energy \( mc^2 \). After the interaction, the photon is destroyed, and three particles are produced: the original electron, a new electron, and a positron. All three particles move off at the same speed \( v \) in the direction of the initial photon.

### Conservation of Energy
The total initial energy is the sum of the photon's energy and the electron's rest energy:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{photon}} + mc^2.
\]
The total final energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of the three particles. Since all three particles have the same speed \( v \), their Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is the same:
\[
E_{\text{final}} = 3 \gamma mc^2,
\]
where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating initial and final energies:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} + mc^2 = 3 \gamma mc^2.
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = 3 \gamma mc^2 - mc^2.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
The initial momentum is entirely due to the photon, \( p_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{photon}} / c \). The final momentum is the sum of the momenta of the three particles, each with momentum \( \gamma m v \):
\[
p_{\text{final}} = 3 \gamma m v.
\]
Equating initial and final momenta:
\[
\frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 \gamma m v.
\]
Substituting \( E_{\text{photon}} = 3 \gamma mc^2 - mc^2 \) into this equation:
\[
\frac{3 \gamma mc^2 - mc^2}{c} = 3 \gamma m v.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{m c^2 (3 \gamma - 1)}{c} = 3 \gamma m v.
\]
Canceling \( m \) and solving for \( v \):
\[
v = \frac{c (3 \gamma - 1)}{3 \gamma}.
\]

### Relating \( \gamma \) and \( v \)
From the definition of \( \gamma \), \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we can express \( v \) in terms of \( \gamma \):
\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]
Substituting this into the expression for \( v \) from momentum conservation:
\[
\frac{c (3 \gamma - 1)}{3 \gamma} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]
Dividing through by \( c \) and squaring both sides:
\[
\left( \frac{3 \gamma - 1}{3 \gamma} \right)^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}.
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
\frac{(3 \gamma - 1)^2}{9 \gamma^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}.
\]
\[
\frac{9 \gamma^2 - 6 \gamma + 1}{9 \gamma^2} = \frac{9 \gamma^2 - 1}{9 \gamma^2}.
\]
Equating the numerators:
\[
9 \gamma^2 - 6 \gamma + 1 = 9 \gamma^2 - 1.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
-6 \gamma + 1 = -1.
\]
\[
6 \gamma = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gamma = \frac{5}{3}.
\]

### Final Calculation
Using \( \gamma = \frac{5}{3} \), substitute back into the energy equation:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = 3 \gamma mc^2 - mc^2.
\]
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = 3 \left( \frac{5}{3} \right) mc^2 - mc^2.
\]
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = 5 mc^2 - mc^2 = 4 mc^2.
\]

Thus, the energy of the photon is \( 4 mc^2 \), corresponding to option **J**.
