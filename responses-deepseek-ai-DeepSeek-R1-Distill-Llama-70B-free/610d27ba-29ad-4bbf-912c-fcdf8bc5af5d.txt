Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about precipitation when H2S is bubbled into a solution containing Zn²+ and Cu²+. Hmm, I need to figure out which precipitates form, if any. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the solution has Zn²+ and Cu²+ each at 0.02 M. The solution is made 1 M in H3O+—so that's a pretty acidic solution. Then H2S is bubbled in until saturation. I know that H2S is a weak acid, and in solution it dissociates in two steps. The problem gives me the K_eq for H2S when saturated as 1e-22. Wait, actually, I think that K_eq is the Henry's law constant or maybe the solubility product? Hmm, no, wait, H2S's dissociation has two K_a values, but when it's saturated, the concentration of H2S in solution is determined by its solubility, which I think is related to K_eq here. Oh, wait, maybe K_eq here is the overall equilibrium constant for the dissociation of H2S in water. So, when H2S is bubbled into the solution until it's saturated, the concentration of S²- in the solution will depend on both the K_eq and the pH.

Wait, let's get this straight. The K_eq given is 1e-22 at saturation. Wait, but H2S is a diprotic acid, so it dissociates in two steps:

H2S ↔ H+ + HS⁻ (K1 ≈ 1e-7)
HS⁻ ↔ H+ + S²- (K2 ≈ 1e-19)

So the overall K for H2S → 2 H+ + S²- would be K1*K2 ≈ 1e-26. But the problem says K_eq is 1e-22. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait, perhaps they're giving K_eq as the overall equilibrium for S²- formation, but under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's the solubility product for H2S, but that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, when the solution is saturated with H2S, the product [H+][S²-] is determined by K_eq. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here, but let's proceed.

The solution is 1 M in H3O+, so [H+] is 1 M (since H3O+ is the dominant protonated form in acidic solution). When H2S is bubbled in, some of it will dissociate, but because the solution is acidic, the S²- ion is not going to be very prevalent. The S²- concentration can be found using the K_eq expression.

Wait, maybe the K_eq given is the solubility equilibrium, so the product [H+][S²-] = K_eq. Because for H2S, the solubility equilibrium is H2S(s) ↔ 2 H+ + S²- with K_eq = [H+]² [S²-]. But wait, when the solution is saturated, H2S is in equilibrium with the solution, so K_eq would be [H+]² [S²-] = (1)^2 * [S²-] = K_eq. So [S²-] = K_eq / [H+]².

Wait, but the given K_eq is 1e-22. So plugging in [H+] = 1 M, [S²-] would be 1e-22 / (1)^2 = 1e-22 M.

Wait, but that's a very low concentration of S²-. Now, I need to compare that to the solubility product (K_sp) of ZnS and CuS to see if precipitation occurs.

ZnS has a K_sp of 1e-22, and CuS has 8e-37. So, the solubility product for each metal sulfide is the product of the metal ion concentration and the sulfide ion concentration, i.e., K_sp = [M²+][S²-].

So for ZnS, the condition for precipitation is when [Zn²+][S²-] > K_sp. Similarly for CuS.

Given that [Zn²+] = [Cu²+] = 0.02 M, and [S²-] is 1e-22, let's compute the product for each.

For ZnS: 0.02 * 1e-22 = 2e-24. The K_sp is 1e-22. So 2e-24 < 1e-22. Therefore, the product is less than the K_sp, so ZnS does not precipitate.

For CuS: 0.02 * 1e-22 = 2e-24. K_sp is 8e-37. Since 2e-24 is way larger than 8e-37, the product is greater than K_sp. So CuS will precipitate.

Wait, but wait a minute, because I might have made a mistake in calculating [S²-]. Let me double-check. The K_eq given is 1e-22 when the solution is saturated with H2S. If K_eq is the product [H+]² [S²-], and [H+] is 1, then [S²-] = K_eq / (1)^2 = 1e-22 M.

Yes, that's correct. So with [S²-] = 1e-22, both Zn²+ and Cu²+ are 0.02 M.

So for ZnS: K_sp = 1e-22. The ion product is (0.02)(1e-22) = 2e-24, which is less than K_sp (1e-22). So no precipitation of ZnS.

For CuS: K_sp is 8e-37. The ion product is 2e-24, which is greater than 8e-37. So precipitation of CuS will occur.

Wait, but wait! I thought that S comes from H2S, and in an acidic solution, H2S is mostly undissociated. So the sulfide ion concentration is very low. But CuS has a much lower K_sp than ZnS. So CuS will precipitate under these conditions.

So the correct outcome is that only CuS precipitates. Looking at the options:

Option C is Precipitation of CuS.

Option E is ZnS followed by CuS. But since ZnS doesn't precipitate, E is not correct.

Option I is both precipitate, which is not the case here.

So the answer should be C.

To determine whether a precipitate forms when H₂S is bubbled into a solution containing Zn²⁺ and Cu²⁺, we analyze the conditions for precipitation using the given equilibrium constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - [Zn²⁺] = [Cu²⁺] = 0.02 M
   - [H₃O⁺] = 1 M ⇒ [H⁺] = 1 M (since H₃O⁺ is the dominant protonated form in acidic solution).
   - H₂S is bubbled into the solution until it is saturated.

2. **Equilibrium Data**:
   - K_eq for H₂S (saturated) = 1 × 10⁻²².
   - K_sp for ZnS = 1 × 10⁻²².
   - K_sp for CuS = 8 × 10⁻³⁷.

3. **Sulfide Ion Concentration ([S²⁻])**:
   - The equilibrium constant for H₂S saturation is given as K_eq = [H⁺]²[S²⁻]. Rearranging, [S²⁻] = K_eq / [H⁺]².
   - Substituting values: [S²⁻] = (1 × 10⁻²²) / (1²) = 1 × 10⁻²² M.

4. **Precipitation Analysis**:
   - Precipitation occurs when the ion product (Q = [M²⁺][S²⁻]) exceeds the solubility product (K_sp) of the compound.
   - For **ZnS**:
     - Q = [Zn²⁺][S²⁻] = (0.02)(1 × 10⁻²²) = 2 × 10⁻²⁴.
     - Since Q (2 × 10⁻²⁴) < K_sp (1 × 10⁻²²), ZnS does not precipitate.
   - For **CuS**:
     - Q = [Cu²⁺][S²⁻] = (0.02)(1 × 10⁻²²) = 2 × 10⁻²⁴.
     - Since Q (2 × 10⁻²⁴) > K_sp (8 × 10⁻³⁷), CuS will precipitate.

### Conclusion:
Under the given conditions, only CuS precipitates because its ion product exceeds its solubility product, while ZnS does not precipitate. Among the options provided:

- **Option C: Precipitation of CuS** is correct.
