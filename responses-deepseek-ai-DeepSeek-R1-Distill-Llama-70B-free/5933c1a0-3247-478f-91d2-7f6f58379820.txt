Question:

IfDNAaseis added to a bacterial cell, the DNA is hydrolyzed , the cell cannot make any more proteins and eventually dies. IfDNAaseis added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce new proteins. Explain.

Options:

A: DNAase specifically targets bacterial DNA, not viral DNA.
B: The virus doesn't contain any genetic material.
C: The virus contains RNA, it is not affected by DNAase.
D: The virus encodes its own DNAase inhibitor, protecting its DNA.
E: The virus contains both DNA and RNA.
F: The virus uses a DNAase-resistant polymerase for replication.
G: The virus has an outer shell that prevents DNAase from entering.
H: The virus contains a special type of DNA that is resistant to DNAase.
I: The virus contains DNA, but DNAase is only effective in bacterial cells.
J: The virus contains DNA, it is not affected by DNAase.

Okay, so I've got this question here about DNAase and its effects on bacterial cells versus RNA viruses. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but let me try to work through this.

So, the question says that when DNAase is added to a bacterial cell, the DNA is hydrolyzed, the cell can't make proteins anymore and dies. But when DNAase is added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce new proteins. I need to explain why that happens. The options are A through J.

First, I think I should recall what DNAase does. DNAase is an enzyme that breaks down DNA. So it's like a DNA cutter. If it's added to a bacterial cell, the cell's DNA gets chopped up. Without DNA, the cell can't transcribe RNA or make proteins, so it dies. That makes sense.

But why doesn't it affect RNA viruses the same way? Well, RNA viruses have RNA as their genetic material, right? So if DNAase is added to them, it shouldn't affect their RNA. Because DNAase specifically breaks down DNA, not RNA. So the viruses can still use their RNA to make proteins, I guess.

Wait, but let me think. RNA viruses infect host cells and use the host's machinery to replicate. So if the virus is in the host cell and DNAase is added, does the DNAase get into the virus? Oh, wait, the question says DNAase is added to the RNA viruses. So maybe the viruses are outside the cell? Or perhaps the DNAase can't get into the viral particles.

Wait, another angle: viruses don't have their own DNA. So for RNA viruses, their genetic material is RNA, not DNA. So DNAase wouldn't do anything to them because there's no DNA to break down. So they can continue making proteins because their RNA is intact.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the virus contains RNA, so it's not affected by DNAase. That sounds right.

Option A says DNAase targets bacterial DNA specifically. Maybe, but the question is about why RNA viruses aren't affected. It's more about what the viruses contain, not the source of the DNA.

Option G suggests the virus has an outer shell preventing DNAase entry. Well, viruses do have capsids, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason here. Because the key is that RNA viruses don't have DNA, so even if DNAase got in, there's nothing to act on.

Option B says the virus doesn't have genetic material, which isn't correct because they do have RNA.

So the correct answer should be C. Because the virus has RNA, DNAase doesn't affect it. Therefore, the virus can continue producing proteins.

The question asks why DNAase affects bacterial cells but not RNA viruses. DNAase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes DNA. When added to bacterial cells, it degrades their DNA, halting protein synthesis and leading to cell death. However, RNA viruses are unaffected because their genetic material is RNA, not DNA. DNAase specifically targets DNA, so it has no effect on RNA viruses, allowing them to continue producing proteins.

Analyzing the options:

- **C** is correct because RNA viruses contain RNA, which DNAase cannot degrade.
- Other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the virus's composition (e.g., B, E, H, I, J) or introduce unnecessary complexities (e.g., A, D, F, G).

The correct answer is **C**.

Answer: C
