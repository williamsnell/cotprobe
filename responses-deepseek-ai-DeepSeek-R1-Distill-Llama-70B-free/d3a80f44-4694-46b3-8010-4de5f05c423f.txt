Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about when the current Dalai Lama was born. The options are from A to J, each with different years. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that the Dalai Lama is a significant figure in Tibetan Buddhism. I think he's been in the news a lot, especially regarding Tibet and China. But wait, I'm not exactly sure about his birth year. Let me think.

I recall that the current Dalai Lama is the 14th one. I think he was born in the early part of the 20th century, but I'm not certain. Maybe the 1930s? Or was it the 1940s? I'm a bit confused. Let's try to piece it together.

I remember that the Dalai Lama was quite young when he became the leader. I think he was around 15 when he took over, which was during a significant historical event. Oh wait, that might have been when China took control of Tibet in 1950. So if he was 15 in 1950, subtracting 15 from 1950 gives 1935. So that would make his birth year 1935.

Looking at the options, J is 1935. So the answer should be J. But wait, let me double-check. I think I've heard somewhere that he was born in 1935. Yeah, that sounds right. So the correct answer is J.

The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, was born on July 6, 1935. This makes option J the correct choice.
