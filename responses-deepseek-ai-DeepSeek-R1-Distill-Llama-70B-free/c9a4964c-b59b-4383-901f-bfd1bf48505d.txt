Okay, so I've got this question about psychology, specifically related to hearing and how we process sound frequencies. Hmm, I remember that the basilar membrane is part of the cochlea in the ear, right? And it has something to do with sound waves being converted into nerve signals.

The question is asking about a theory where the position on the basilar membrane that peaks depends on the tone's frequency. So, I think this relates to how different frequencies are processed in different parts of the ear. Oh wait, I think there's a theory called the place theory or place-frequency theory. That's the one where higher frequency sounds activate different areas of the basilar membrane compared to lower frequencies.

Let me think about the options given. Option I is 'place', which I believe is the correct term. Other options I remember: the frequency theory, which is another old theory, suggests that the entire cochlea vibrates at the same frequency, but that doesn't explain how we distinguish different frequencies. So that's probably not it.

Then there's volley theory, which says that different neurons fire at different times to handle higher frequencies beyond what individual neurons can handle. But that's more about how the timing of nerve impulses allows us to perceive higher frequencies, not the location on the basilar membrane.

Option C is specificity theory, which I think is older and less accurate. It proposed that each sound frequency has specific neurons, but that doesn't directly tie to the basilar membrane's peaks.

So putting it together, the place theory (option I) is the one where the position along the basilar membrane corresponds to different frequencies. That makes sense because the membrane is tonotopically organizedâ€”meaning different regions respond to different frequencies.

The theory that explains how the position on the basilar membrane where waves peak depends on the frequency of a tone is called **place theory**. This theory states that different sections of the basilar membrane respond to different sound frequencies, with higher frequencies activating narrower, stiffer sections closer to the base of the cochlea and lower frequencies activating wider, more flexible sections near the apex. 

Among the options provided:

- **A (frequency theory)** suggests that the entire cochlea vibrates at the same frequency, which doesn't explain frequency differentiation.
- **F (volley theory)** focuses on how neurons fire in rapid succession to process high frequencies but doesn't address the basilar membrane's spatial response.
- **C (specificity theory)** is an outdated idea proposing specific neurons for each frequency but doesn't align with modern understanding.

Thus, the correct answer is **I (place theory)**, as it directly explains the tonotopic organization of the basilar membrane.

Answer: I
