Question:

A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician because of easy bruising for 4 months. She has a history of lung cancer treated with radiation therapy 6 months ago. She has a 2-year history of hypertension treated with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Examination, including neurologic examination, shows no abnormalities except for multiple ecchymoses. Her hemoglobin concentration is 13 g/dL, leukocyte count is 5000/mm3 , and platelet count is 35,000/mm3 . A serum antiplatelet antibody assay is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?

Options:

A: CT scan of the abdomen
B: CT scan of the chest
C: Bronchoscopy
D: Bone marrow aspiration

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The patient is a 67-year-old woman who presents with easy bruising for the past four months. Her history includes lung cancer treated with radiation therapy six months ago. She also has hypertension, treated with a thiazide diuretic and an ACE inhibitor. On exam, nothing's abnormal except the bruising. Her labs show a normal hemoglobin (13 g/dL), a normal leukocyte count (5000/mm3), but a low platelet count (35,000/mm3). The antiplatelet antibody assay is negative.

The question is about the next appropriate diagnostic step. The options are CT abdomen, CT chest, bronchoscopy, or bone marrow aspiration.

Hmm. So, the main issue here is the low platelet count, which is causing the easy bruising. This is thrombocytopenia. The causes of thrombocytopenia can be divided into several categories: decreased production, increased destruction, or sequestration.

First, let's consider her history. She had lung cancer treated with radiation. Radiation can affect the bone marrow, potentially leading to decreased production of blood cells, including platelets. But her other cell lines (RBC and WBC) are normal, which is a bit confusing because if it's bone marrow suppression from radiation, I'd expect maybe some changes in other cell lines as well, but maybe not necessarily. Alternatively, sometimes the bone marrow can compensate, so it might not show up in all counts.

She's also on medications: thiazide diuretics and ACE inhibitors. I think thiazides can sometimes cause thrombocytopenia, but it's not super common. ACE inhibitors are less likely, I believe. But the negative antiplatelet antibody makes immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) less likely because that test would usually be positive in ITP. So perhaps it's not an immune-mediated destruction issue.

Given her history of lung cancer, another possibility is metastatic disease affecting the bone marrow. Lung cancer can spread, and bone marrow metastases can cause decreased platelet production. Alternatively, maybe the radiation therapy caused some damage to the bone marrow, leading to thrombocytopenia.

In this case, what's the next step? They've already done the basic blood work. The antiplatelet antibody is negative, so ITP is less likely. So, looking for other causes. Since she has a history of cancer, it's important to check for possible bone marrow involvement.

Bone marrow aspiration would allow them to look directly at the bone marrow cells. If the marrow is producing platelets normally, that suggests the problem is elsewhere. If there's infiltration (like from cancer), that would show up. Alternatively, if the marrow is aplastic, that's another issue.

CT scans could be useful, but let's see. The chest CT might show any recurrence of lung cancer or any mediastinal issues, but how does that tie into her low platelets? Unless there's a metastatic lesion affecting the bone marrow, but a CT might not pick that up as clearly as a bone marrow exam. Similarly, an abdominal CT might look for spleen issues, but since she doesn't have other signs of splenic enlargement or issues, that might not be the first step.

Bronchoscopy is more for evaluating the airways, maybe for recurrence of lung cancer, but again, how does that explain the platelets? Unless she has a lung mass causing some localized issue, but I don't see the direct link.

So, putting it together, the most appropriate next step is probably a bone marrow aspiration to look for marrow involvement, either from metastasis or from radiation effects. That would directly address the cause of her thrombocytopenia when other causes like ITP are ruled out.

The patient is a 67-year-old woman presenting with easy bruising due to thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 35,000/mmÂ³). Her history includes lung cancer treated with radiation therapy and hypertension managed with a thiazide diuretic and ACE inhibitor. The negative antiplatelet antibody assay makes immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) less likely. The normal hemoglobin and leukocyte count suggest that other cell lines are unaffected, which is notable but does not rule out bone marrow pathology.

Given her history of lung cancer, the possibility of bone marrow involvement, such as metastasis or radiation-induced damage, must be considered. Bone marrow aspiration is the most appropriate next step to directly evaluate the bone marrow and determine the cause of thrombocytopenia. This procedure can identify whether there is marrow infiltration, aplasia, or other abnormalities affecting platelet production.

Other options, such as CT scans of the chest or abdomen, are less directly relevant to diagnosing the cause of thrombocytopenia. While a chest CT could assess for lung cancer recurrence, it would not provide specific information about bone marrow function. Similarly, bronchoscopy is more suited for evaluating airway pathology and is not indicated in this scenario.

Thus, bone marrow aspiration is the most appropriate diagnostic step to investigate the thrombocytopenia in this patient.
