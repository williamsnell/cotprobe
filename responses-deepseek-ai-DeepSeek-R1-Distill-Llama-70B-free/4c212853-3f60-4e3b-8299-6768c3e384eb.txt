Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the percentage of the world's land area that's forested as of 2015. I'm not exactly sure of the exact figure, but I think I can work through it by considering what I remember and maybe some related facts.

First, I know that forests cover a significant portion of the Earth's land. But I also remember that the number isn't extremely high like 70% or something. I think it's lower than that. I've heard before that about a third of the land is covered by forests. Wait, a third is like 33.33%, right? So looking at the options, I see option I is 30%, which is close to that.

Wait, but I should double-check. Maybe I'm misremembering. Let me think about other sources. I recall that the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations publishes reports on global forest resources. From what I've heard, their reports around 2015 stated that forests cover about 30% of the Earth's land area. That would make sense because I think the number is around there, not too high, not too low.

Let me consider the other options. Option A is 70%, which seems way too high. I know that water covers most of the Earth, like over 70%, so land itself is only about 30%, so 70% of land can't be forested. That doesn't add up. Option D is 60%, which also seems too high. I don't think forests are that dominant on land.

Option G is 40%, which is a bit higher than what I thought. Maybe I should think again. Wait, did the percentage increase or decrease over time? I know there's been deforestation, but some areas have afforestation efforts too. But I'm pretty sure the figure hovers around 30%.

Another angle: I remember that the total forest area is something like 4 billion hectares. And the total land area is about 14.8 billion hectares (since the Earth's land is roughly 148 million square kilometers, which is 14.8 billion hectares). So 4 divided by 14.8 is approximately 0.27, which is 27%, so about 30%. That lines up with option I.

Wait, could it be 30%? That seems right. So among the options, I is 30%, which should be the correct answer.

As of 2015, approximately 30% of the world’s land area is forested. This figure aligns with reports from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which estimated that forests cover about a third of the Earth's land. Considering the total land area and forested hectares, the calculation also supports this percentage. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I: 30%

Answer: I
