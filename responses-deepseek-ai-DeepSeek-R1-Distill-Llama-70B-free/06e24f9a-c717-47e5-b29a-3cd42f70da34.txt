Okay, so I've got this question about choosing between delta modulation (DM) and pulse code modulation (PCM) for a baseband signal. The goal is to find the bandwidth ratio of PCM to DM when the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for both is at least 30 dB. Hmm, a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that both DM and PCM are types of digital modulation techniques, but they work differently. DM is a type of differential PCM, I think, where only the difference between consecutive samples is transmitted. PCM, on the other hand, quantizes each sample directly into a code.

The question gives a hint about the bandwidth ratio: [(BW_pcm) / (BW_DM)] = [(f_m*N) / (1/(2τ))]. Wait, let me parse that. So BW_pcm is the bandwidth for PCM, which I believe depends on the sampling rate and the number of bits per sample. BW_DM is the bandwidth for delta modulation, which uses a lower bit rate but maybe a higher sampling frequency.

Wait, for PCM, the bandwidth is typically the sampling rate times the number of bits per sample (N), right? Because each sample is transmitted as N bits. So BW_pcm = f_m * N, where f_m is the sampling frequency.

For DM, since it encodes the difference between samples, the bit rate is lower. But the hint says BW_DM is 1/(2τ), where τ is the time between samples. Oh wait, because the sampling rate for DM is higher than PCM. Because in DM, the step size is adapted based on the signal's slope, so it samples more frequently. So the bandwidth for DM would be inversely proportional to twice the sampling interval, so BW_DM = 1/(2τ). But wait, isn't the sampling rate f_s = 1/τ? So BW_DM would be f_s / 2, perhaps? Or maybe it's the bit rate? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, let's think again. For PCM, the bit rate R is N times the sampling rate f_s, so R = N*f_s. And the bandwidth BW_pcm is approximately R, assuming it's a baseband signal without modulation. So BW_pcm = N*f_s.

For DM, the bit rate is the same as the sampling rate because each sample is represented by a single bit (assuming binary DM). So R_DM = f_s_dm, where f_s_dm is the sampling rate for DM. Therefore, BW_DM would be f_s_dm, as each bit is a pulse. So the ratio would be BW_pcm/BW_DM = (N*f_s) / (f_s_dm).

But wait, the hint says it's (f_m*N)/(1/(2τ)). Hmm, maybe I should look at their expressions.

Wait, the hint gives [(BW_pcm) / (BW_DM)] = [(f_m*N) / (1/(2τ))]. So, f_m is probably the message bandwidth, but in PCM, the sampling frequency f_s is typically twice the message bandwidth (Nyquist rate), so f_s = 2*f_m. So for PCM, BW_pcm = N*f_s = N*(2*f_m) = 2*N*f_m.

Wait, but the hint suggests BW_pcm is f_m*N. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps f_m is the sampling frequency for DM, which is higher.

Wait, another approach: For a given S/N ratio, both modulations have their own expressions. Let's find the expressions for S/N in PCM and DM.

Starting with PCM: The quantization noise in PCM is given by S/N = 3*2^(2N)/(M^2 -1), where M is the number of quantization levels. Wait, more accurately, the signal-to-quantization noise ratio for PCM is (3 * M^2 ) / (2^(2N) -1 ), but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, for a sinusoidal signal, the S/N is approximately 1.5*2^(2N)/(M^2), but I'm getting a bit fuzzy here.

Wait, I think the correct formula for S/N in PCM is (3 * 2^(2N)) / (M^2 -1), assuming M=2^N. Because each codeword corresponds to a quantization level, and M is the number of levels. So if we have N bits, that's 2^N levels, so M=2^N. So substituting M=2^N, we get S/N = 3*(2^(2N))/( (2^N)^2 -1 ) ≈ 3*(2^(2N))/(2^(2N)) )=3, but that can't be right because S/N depends on N. Wait, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. The signal-to-quantization noise ratio (SQNR) for PCM is given by SQNR = (3 * (2^(2N)) ) / (M^2), but M is the number of levels, which is 2^N. So M=2^N, so M^2 = 2^(2N). So SQNR becomes 3*2^(2N) / (2^(2N)) )= 3. That can't be right because that would mean SQNR is 3 (about 4.77 dB), which is way below 30 dB.

Wait, I'm definitely confusing something. Let me think again. The correct formula for SQNR in PCM is ( (3 * (2^(2N)) ) / ( (2^N)^2 -1 ) ) approximates to 3*2^(2N)/(2^(2N)) )= 3, which is about 4.77 dB. But that's only correct for a sine wave, perhaps. Wait, no, I think the correct formula is SQNR = (3 * (2^(2N)) ) / (M^2), but M is the number of levels. So if M=2^N, then M^2=2^(2N), so SQNR= 3*2^(2N)/(2^(2N))=3, which is 4.77 dB. But that's way too low. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another approach: The quantization noise power N_q for PCM is given by N_q = (Δ^2)/12, where Δ is the step size. The signal power S depends on the peak value, say V_p. So the maximum signal power is S = V_p^2 / 2. The SQNR is then (V_p^2 / 2) / (Δ^2 /12 ) = (6 V_p^2 ) / (Δ^2 ). But for M levels, the step size Δ is 2V_p/(M), assuming symmetric quantization. So Δ = 2V_p/(M). Substituting that in, N_q = ( (2V_p/M)^2 ) /12 = (4 V_p^2)/(12 M^2 ) )= V_p^2/(3 M^2 ). So SQNR = (V_p^2 / 2) / (V_p^2/(3 M^2 )) )= (3 M^2 ) / 2. But wait, that gives S/N = (3 M^2 ) / 2.

Wait, but M=2^N, so S/N = (3*(2^N)^2 ) /2 = 3*2^(2N)/2 = (3/2)*2^(2N) = 3*2^(2N-1). So the S/N in dB is 10 log10(3*2^(2N-1)) = 10 [ log10(3) + (2N-1) log10(2) ].

Wait, but the question gives S/N >=30 dB, so let's set that equal:

10 [ log10(3) + (2N -1) log10(2) ] >=30.

Divide both sides by 10: log10(3) + (2N -1) log10(2) >=3.

Compute log10(3)=0.4771, log10(2)=0.3010.

So:

0.4771 + (2N -1)*0.3010 >=3.

Let me compute for N:

(2N -1)*0.3010 >= 3 -0.4771 = 2.5229.

Divide both sides by 0.3010:

2N -1 >= 2.5229 / 0.3010 ≈8.385.

So 2N >=9.385 => N>=4.6925. Since N must be integer, N=5 bits.

Wait, but wait, this seems like a lot. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Another approach: The SQNR for a sine wave in PCM is given by SQNR = 1.5 * 2^(2N), which would be in dB: SQNR (dB) = 10 log10(1.5 * 2^(2N)).

Wait, but that would make it even higher. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up with different formulas.

Alternatively, let me recall that for PCM, the SQNR is approximately 4.77 + 6N dB, where N is the number of bits per sample. So for N bits, SQNR ≈4.77 +6N dB.

Wait, that makes sense. So for the SQNR to be at least 30 dB:

4.77 +6N >=30 →6N>=25.23 →N>=4.205. So N=5 bits. Hmm, but earlier calculation gave N=5 as well. So perhaps N=5 is the number of bits needed for PCM to achieve S/N of 30 dB.

Wait, but let's double-check. If N=4, SQNR would be 4.77 +24=28.77 dB <30. N=5 gives 4.77+30=34.77 dB >=30. So that's correct. So for PCM, N=5 bits.

Now, moving to delta modulation. The S/N for DM is given by S/N = (3 f_m^2 )/( (f_d)^2 ), where f_d is the sampling frequency for DM, and f_m is the message bandwidth. Wait, I'm not sure about this formula. Alternatively, I remember that in DM, the quantization noise is lower for low-frequency signals but increases for high-frequency components.

Wait, another formula: The S/N ratio in delta modulation is approximately S/N = (3 (f_d)^2 )/( (f_m)^2 ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, S/N is inversely proportional to the square of the message bandwidth and proportional to the square of the sampling frequency.

Wait, I think the correct formula is S/N = (3 (f_d)^2 ) / ( (M^2 -1) (f_m)^2 ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's S/N = (3 (f_s)^2 ) / (f_m)^2 ), where f_s is the sampling frequency for DM.

Wait, wait—let me think carefully. The noise in delta modulation comes from the quantization error, which depends on the step size and the slope of the signal. For a sine wave of frequency f_m and amplitude A, the maximum slope is 2πf_m A. The number of steps the quantizer can take to follow this slope is determined by the step size Δ and the sampling frequency f_d. So the number of steps per cycle is f_d/(f_m). The total number of steps needed to avoid slope overload is when the step size times the number of steps per half-cycle equals the peak slope.

Wait, perhaps the quantization noise variance in DM is given by σ²_n = Δ² (1/(12)) [1 + (f_m/(f_d/2))²], but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the noise power is given by N = (Δ^2/12) [1 + (2πf_m)^2/( (2Δ f_d)^2 ) ].

Wait, maybe it's better to recall that for DM, the signal to quantization noise ratio (SNR) is given by SNR = (3 (f_d)^2 )/( (f_m)^2 (1 + (f_m/f_d )^2 )) ), but I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, I remember that for DM, the SNR is approximately SNR = (3/8) * (f_d/(f_m))^2, assuming that the step size is optimized. That sounds familiar. So SNR (dB) = 10 log [ (3/8) (f_d/f_m)^2 ].

Wait, let me check. If that's the case, then for SNR >=30 dB:

10 log [ (3/8) (f_d/f_m)^2 ] >=30 → log [ (3/8) (f_d/f_m)^2 ] >=3 → (3/8)(f_d/f_m)^2 >=10^3=1000.

So (f_d/f_m)^2 >= (8/3)*1000 → f_d/f_m >= sqrt( (8*1000)/3 ) ≈ sqrt(2666.666...) ≈51.62.

So f_d >=51.62 *f_m.

But in the PCM case, the sampling frequency is f_s = 2*f_m (Nyquist rate). So for DM, f_d is much higher than f_s for PCM, which makes sense because DM typically requires a higher sampling rate.

Now, the bandwidth for PCM is BW_pcm = N * f_s, since each sample is represented by N bits. So with N=5, f_s=2f_m, BW_pcm=5*2f_m=10f_m.

The bandwidth for DM is determined by the bit rate. Since DM uses a 1-bit per sample encoding, the bit rate is f_d. So BW_DM = f_d.

Wait, but the hint suggests BW_DM is 1/(2τ). Since τ is the sampling interval for DM, which is 1/f_d. So 1/(2τ) = f_d /2. But that doesn't match with my earlier thought. So according to the hint, BW_DM = 1/(2τ) = f_d /2.

Wait, perhaps the bandwidth for DM is f_d/2, considering it's a baseband signal. So BW_dm = f_d/2.

So the ratio BW_pcm/BW_DM = (10 f_m) / (f_d/2) )= 20 f_m /f_d.

But from earlier, f_d =51.62 f_m. So substituting:

BW_ratio=20 f_m/(51.62 f_m) )=20/51.62≈0.3876.

Wait, but this is the ratio of PCM to DM bandwidth. But the problem says to find the ratio of PCM to DM. So if BW_pcm is 10f_m and BW_DM is f_d/2=51.62f_m/2≈25.81f_m, then BW_pcm/BW_DM=10f_m/(25.81f_m)=0.3876.

But let me check the numbers again. Wait, if BW_pcm is N*f_s =5*2f_m=10f_m.

BW_DM as per the hint is 1/(2τ). Since τ=1/f_d, BW_DM= f_d/2.

So BW_ratio= (10f_m)/(f_d/2) )= 20 f_m/f_d.

From the DM SNR requirement, we found f_d ≈51.62 f_m.

So BW_ratio=20/51.62≈0.3876, which is roughly 0.388.

But let me see the options. The options are all in terms of cube roots, logs, etc. So perhaps I should approach this more algebraically.

Let me rederive the expressions properly.

For PCM:

SQNR (dB) = 4.77 +6N.

Set >=30 dB:

4.77 +6N >=30 →6N>=25.23 →N>=25.23/6≈4.205. So N=5.

So N=5 bits.

Now for DM, the SQNR is given by:

SQNR = (3/8) (f_d/f_m)^2.

Expressed in dB: SQNR (dB)=10 log( (3/8) (f_d/f_m)^2 ).

Set >=30 dB:

10 log( (3/8) (f_d/f_m)^2 ) >=30 → log( (3/8) (f_d/f_m)^2 ) >=3 → (3/8)(f_d/f_m)^2 >=10^3=1000.

So (f_d/f_m)^2 >= (8/3)*1000 → f_d/f_m >= sqrt( (8000/3) ) ≈sqrt(2666.6667)≈51.62.

So f_d=51.62 f_m.

Now, BW_pcm for PCM is N times the sampling rate f_s. For PCM, the sampling rate f_s is 2f_m (Nyquist rate). So BW_pcm= N * f_s=5*2f_m=10f_m.

BW_DM is given by the hint as 1/(2τ). Since the sampling rate for DM is f_d, the sampling interval τ=1/f_d. So 1/(2τ)=f_d/2.

So BW_DM= f_d/2= (51.62 f_m)/2≈25.81 f_m.

Thus, the bandwidth ratio BW_pcm/BW_DM=10f_m/(25.81f_m)=10/25.81≈0.3876.

Wait, but the options seem to have terms like cube roots and logs. So perhaps I need to express this ratio more symbolically.

But wait, let's think about the general expressions without plugging in the numbers.

From DM:

SQNR = (3/8) (f_d/f_m)^2.

Set SQNR >=30 dB:

(3/8)(f_d/f_m)^2 >=10^3 → (f_d/f_m)^2 >= (8/3)*10^3 → f_d/f_m = sqrt( (8*10^3)/3 ).

So f_d= f_m * sqrt( (8*10^3)/3 )= f_m * sqrt( (8000)/3 )=f_m * sqrt( (8/3)*10^3 )=f_m * sqrt(8/3) * sqrt(10^3 )= f_m * (2√(2/3)) ) * (10√10 )≈ f_m * 2 * 1.4142 * 0.5774 * 10 *3.1623. Wait, perhaps it's better to keep it symbolic.

So f_d= f_m * sqrt(8000/3 )=f_m * sqrt( (8*10^3)/3 ).

So BW_DM= f_d /2= (f_m * sqrt(8000/3 )) )/2= (f
