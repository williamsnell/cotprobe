Question:

A longshoreman fell to his death through an open hatch on the deck of a ship. The longshoreman was an employee of a company that had contracted with the ship's owner to load and unload the ship. The fall occurred at night, when loading work was over for the day, and there was no reason for the longshoreman to have been near the hatch. A negligence action was filed against the ship's owner for the death of the longshoreman. In that action, the owner has moved for summary judgment and has provided unrebutted evidence that it is customary for the crews of ships to open the hatches for ventilation after the longshoremen have left the ships. How should the court respond to the motion?

Options:

A: Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the ship's owner is liable if the hatch was left open irresponsibly.
B: Grant the motion, because the custom should be considered conclusive on the issue of negligence.
C: Grant the motion, because it is customary for the crews to open the hatches for ventilation after the longshoremen have left the ship.
D: Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the ship's owner should win if the longshoreman was improperly near the hatch.
E: Deny the motion, because the probability of serious injury caused by falling down an open hatch clearly outweighs the burden of keeping the hatch closed.
F: Grant the motion, as the longshoreman was an employee of a different company and the ship's owner can't be held responsible for his whereabouts.
G: Deny the motion, because the ship's owner should have ensured that all hatches were closed after the longshoremen had left the ship.
H: Grant the motion, because there was no reason for the longshoreman to have been near the hatch.
I: Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the custom is relevant but not conclusive on the issue of negligence.
J: Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the custom is irrelevant to the issue of negligence.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a legal case involving a longshoreman who fell to his death through an open hatch on a ship. The question is about whether the court should grant summary judgment to the ship's owner or let the case go to a jury. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, I need to understand the scenario. The longshoreman was working for a company contracted by the ship's owner to load and unload the ship. He fell at night after work was done, and there was no reason for him to be near the hatch. The ship's owner is being sued for negligence and has moved for summary judgment, providing unrebutted evidence that it's customary for crews to open hatches for ventilation after the longshoremen leave.

So, the key here is negligence and whether the ship's owner breached their duty of care. I remember that in negligence cases, the plaintiff must show that the defendant owed a duty, breached that duty, causing the plaintiff's injury, and actual damages.

The ship's owner is arguing that because it's customary to open the hatches, they didn't breach any duty. But wait, custom can be evidence of what's reasonable, but it's not conclusive. So even if everyone does it, if it's an unsafe practice, the court might still find negligence.

I think the owner's argument is that since it's customary to open hatches, their action was reasonable, so no negligence. But the plaintiff's side would argue that leaving the hatch open without ensuring it's safe could still be a breach of duty, especially if it's foreseeable that someone might fall in, even if they're not supposed to be there.

In this case, the longshoreman wasn't supposed to be near the hatch, but he was. So maybe the question is whether the owner should have anticipated that someone might be around and take precautions. But the owner might argue that since it's after hours and the area was supposed to be clear, they had no duty to protect against that.

Wait, but in premises liability, the duty of care can vary based on the status of the person on the property. Here, the longshoreman was an employee of a contractor, so maybe he's considered an invitee or something else. But since he was there after work, perhaps he's a trespasser or a licensee. If he's a trespasser, the duty is lower, but if he's a licensee, maybe higher.

But I'm not sure about that aspect. The main point is about the custom. The owner provided evidence that it's customary to open hatches, but the court can't just grant summary judgment based solely on custom. The jury should decide whether that custom was reasonable or if it created an unsafe condition.

So, looking at the options:

Option I says to deny the motion and let the jury decide, considering that custom is relevant but not conclusive. That makes sense because while custom is a factor in determining negligence, it's not the only thing. The jury should weigh whether the custom was reasonable in this case.

Other options: Option C says grant because it's customary. That would make custom conclusive, which I don't think is right. Option A says deny and instruct that owner is liable if irresponsible. That's too much; it's not about whether it was irresponsible, but whether the owner breached a duty.

Option D says deny and instruct owner wins if the man was improperly near. That's about the longshoreman's actions, but the issue is the owner's duty, not just the victim's presence.

Option E talks about balancing the risk and burden. That's more of a negligence per se or policy decision, but the question is about the motion for summary judgment, which is about whether there's a genuine issue of material fact.

So the court shouldn't grant summary judgment just because of the custom. The jury should decide if the custom was a reasonable practice or if it was negligent to leave the hatch open under the circumstances.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option I: deny the motion and let the jury consider the custom as relevant but not conclusive.

The court should deny the motion for summary judgment and allow the case to proceed to the jury. While the ship's owner provided evidence that it is customary for crews to open hatches for ventilation after longshoremen have left, custom alone does not conclusively determine whether the owner breached their duty of care. Custom is relevant to the issue of negligence but is not dispositive. The jury should weigh whether the custom was reasonable under the circumstances and whether the owner's actions constituted a breach of duty. Therefore, the court should instruct the jury that the custom is relevant but not conclusive on the issue of negligence.
