Okay, so I've got this problem about depreciation for an electric sign. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that depreciation is about allocating the cost of an asset over its useful life. There are different methods, like straight-line and something about hours of use. 

The problem says the sign costs $4,500 and has an expected life of 11,250 hours. The scrap value is $450. And they want the depreciation charge for a month where it was used 478 hours. So I think this is using the units-of-production method because it's based on hours used.

Wait, units-of-production method calculates depreciation based on the number of units produced or hours used. So the formula should be something like (Cost - Scrap Value) divided by total expected hours, then multiplied by the hours used in the period.

Let me jot that down. Cost is $4,500, scrap is $450. So the depreciable amount is 4500 - 450 = $4,050. Total life is 11,250 hours. So the depreciation per hour would be 4050 / 11250. Let me calculate that.

4050 divided by 11250. Hmm, 4050 รท 11250. Let me see, 4050 divided by 11250. Let's simplify that. Both divided by 75: 4050/75 is 54, 11250/75 is 150. So 54/150. Which is the same as 9/25, because 54 รท6=9, 150 รท6=25. 9 divided by 25 is 0.36. So each hour, the depreciation is $0.36.

Wait, wait, wait. 9/25 is 0.36, yes. So per hour, $0.36 depreciation.

Now, in the month, it was used 478 hours. So the total depreciation for the month is 478 multiplied by 0.36. Let me compute that.

Hmm, 478 * 0.36. Let me break it down. 400 * 0.36 is 144. Then 78 * 0.36. 70 *0.36 is 25.2, 8*0.36 is 2.88. So 25.2 +2.88 =28.08. So total is 144 +28.08 =172.08. So approximately $172.08.

Looking at the options, option G is $172.08. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a calculation error. Let me recalculate 4050/11250. 4050 divided by 11250.

Alternatively, 4050 รท 11250 = 0.36. Because 4050 is 36% of 11250? Let me check: 11250 *0.36 = 4050. Yes, correct. So the rate per hour is right.

Then 478 *0.36. Let me calculate that again. 478 * 0.36. 400*0.36 is 144. 70*0.36=25.2, 8*0.36=2.88. 144+25.2=169.2 +2.88=172.08. Yep, that's right.

So the monthly depreciation is $172.08, which matches option G.

To calculate the depreciation charge for the electric sign using the units-of-production method, we first determine the depreciable amount by subtracting the scrap value from the initial cost:

\[
\text{Depreciable Amount} = \$4,500 - \$450 = \$4,050
\]

Next, we calculate the depreciation rate per hour by dividing the depreciable amount by the total expected life in hours:

\[
\text{Depreciation Rate per Hour} = \frac{\$4,050}{11,250 \, \text{hours}} = \$0.36 \, \text{per hour}
\]

For the month in which the sign was used for 478 hours, the total depreciation charge is:

\[
\text{Depreciation Charge} = 478 \, \text{hours} \times \$0.36 \, \text{per hour} = \$172.08
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**G: $172.08**
