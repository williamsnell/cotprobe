Question:

A plaintiff was driving her car when she stopped at a red light at an intersection. A defendant, who was behind her, did not see the red light and failed to stop. He crashed into the rear of the woman's car and pushed her onto the curb and into a tree. When the plaintiff got out of her car, she felt fine physically, but was emotionally upset when she saw that the hood and trunk of her car were severely damaged. The next day she received an estimate from the mechanic for $1,950 to repair her car. She consulted an attorney the following afternoon and, that evening, suddenly developed shooting back pains. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the defendant based on a theory of negligence. One day prior to trial, two years after the accident, the plaintiff went to take a photograph of the accident scene. At trial, the photograph is

Options:

A: admissible, if the photograph correctly and accurately portrayed the accident scene.
B: admissible, if the photograph was taken by a professional photographer.
C: inadmissible, if the defendant objects, because the photograph was taken two years after the accident.
D: inadmissible, if the defendant objects, because the photograph does not show the damage to the plaintiff's car.
E: inadmissible, if the defendant objects, because the photograph might influence the jury's opinion unfairly.
F: admissible, if the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conditions at the scene of the accident were the same as when the photograph was taken.
G: admissible, if the plaintiff identifies the photograph at trial.
H: inadmissible, if the defendant objects, because the photograph was not taken immediately after the accident.
I: inadmissible, if the defendant objects, because the photograph is non-verbal hearsay.
J: admissible, if the plaintiff can prove the photograph has not been altered in any way.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question about the admissibility of a photograph taken two years after an accident. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is a negligence case where the plaintiff's car was damaged, and she's suing the defendant. She took a photo of the accident scene two years later, the day before the trial. The question is whether this photo is admissible.

First, I remember that for evidence to be admissible, it needs to be relevant. But there's more to it when it comes to photographs. I think the key here is whether the photograph accurately represents the scene at the time of the event it's trying to depict.

Photographs are generally admissible if they fairly and accurately show the scene. But if the scene has changed significantly, then the photo might not be reliable. So, the issue here is that the photo was taken two years after the accident. The defendant might argue that conditions changed, making the photo inadmissible.

Wait, but the plaintiff took the photo herself. So, for the photo to be admissible, she needs to testify that it accurately represents the scene as it was at the time of the accident. Or wait, maybe she needs to show that the conditions haven't changed. Like, if the intersection looks the same, then the photo would be okay even if taken later.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's admissible if it accurately portrays the scene. But does the timing matter? If the scene has changed, then even if the photo is accurate when taken, it might not accurately show the original scene.

Option F says it's admissible if the plaintiff can show the conditions were the same. That sounds right. Because if the scene hasn't changed, then a photo taken later can still be used to show what it looked like at the time of the accident.

Option C and H say inadmissible if the defendant objects because of the timing. But I think timing alone isn't the issue; it's whether the scene has changed. So the photo's admissibility would depend on whether the conditions are the same.

So the correct answer would be that the photo is admissible if the conditions are the same, which is option F.

The admissibility of the photograph hinges on whether it accurately reflects the accident scene as it was at the time of the incident. While the timing of the photo (two years later) might raise concerns, the critical factor is whether the conditions at the scene remained unchanged. If the plaintiff can demonstrate that the scene's conditions were the same when the photograph was taken as they were at the time of the accident, the photograph would be admissible. 

The best answer is F.
