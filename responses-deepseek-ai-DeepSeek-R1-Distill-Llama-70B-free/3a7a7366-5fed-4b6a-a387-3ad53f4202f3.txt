Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about escape velocity and the root mean square velocity of hydrogen gas. Hmm, I need to find the temperature at which the RMS velocity of H2 equals the escape velocity of Earth. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, I remember that the root mean square velocity (rms) is given by the formula:

v_rms = sqrt(3RT/(M))

Where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and M is the molar mass of the gas. Oh wait, right, M is in grams per mole because R is in ergs per mole per degree.

The problem gives me the escape velocity as 1.1 × 10^6 cm/s. Wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let me jot that down.

So, escape velocity, v_escape = 1.1e6 cm/s.

I need to set v_rms equal to v_escape and solve for T.

So, setting them equal:

sqrt(3RT/M) = 1.1e6 cm/s

I'll square both sides to eliminate the square root:

3RT/M = (1.1e6)^2

Now, solving for T:

T = (M * (1.1e6)^2) / (3R)

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. But first, I need to make sure all the units are compatible.

The gas constant R is given as 8.3e7 erg/(mol·K). Oh, and M is the molar mass in grams per mole. Since H2 is diatomic, the molar mass should be 2 * atomic weight of H. The atomic weight of H is given as 1, so M = 2 g/mol.

So M = 2 g/mol.

Putting it all together:

T = (2 g/mol * (1.1e6 cm/s)^2) / (3 * 8.3e7 erg/(mol·K))

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute (1.1e6)^2. That's 1.21e12 (cm²/s²).

Then, numerator is 2 * 1.21e12 = 2.42e12 erg? Wait, because cm²/s² multiplied by grams (since 1 erg is 1 g·cm²/s²).

Wait, let me think again. The formula:

v is in cm/s. So v squared is cm²/s².

R is in erg/mol·K, and 1 erg is 1 g·cm²/s².

So yes, when we multiply M (g/mol) by v^2 (cm²/s²), the result is (g·cm²/s²)/mol, which is erg/mol.

So the numerator is 2 * 1.21e12 = 2.42e12 erg/mol.

Then the denominator is 3 * 8.3e7 = 2.49e8 erg/(mol·K).

So T is (2.42e12) / (2.49e8) K.

Compute that division: 2.42e12 / 2.49e8 = approximately (2.42 / 2.49) * 1e4.

2.42 /2.49 is roughly 0.972, so 0.972e4 K is about 9720 K.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 9.72e3 K, which is 9720 K. That's really close to my calculation.

Wait, did I do everything correctly? Let me double-check.

Escape velocity v = 1.1e6 cm/s.

v_rms = sqrt(3RT/M), so setting equal to v gives:

sqrt(3RT/M) = v.

Square both sides: 3RT/M = v².

So T = (M v²)/(3 R).

Plugging in the numbers:

M = 2 g/mol.

v² is (1.1e6)^2 = 1.21e12 cm²/s².

Multiply M and v²: 2 * 1.21e12 = 2.42e12.

Divide by 3R: 3 * 8.3e7 = 2.49e8.

So 2.42e12 / 2.49e8 = (2.42 / 2.49) * 1e4.

2.42 divided by 2.49 is about 0.972. So 0.972e4 is 9720 K.

Which is 9.72e3 K, so option C.

Wait, but wait a second. The options:

A: 1.5e4 K

B: 1.2e4

C: 9.72e3

So that's why option C is correct.

But wait, another thought: sometimes when I see such problems, I might have confused rms velocity with average velocity or something else. But no, the problem clearly states rms, so I think I did it right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the units again.

R is 8.3e7 erg/mol·K.

Ergs are g·cm²/s².

So units in the numerator:

M (g/mol) * v² (cm²/s²) → g·mol⁻¹ * cm²/s² → erg/mol.

Denominator: 3R → erg/(mol·K) → when dividing, units are erg/mol divided by erg/(mol·K) → K.

So yes, units are correct.

I think I'm confident the answer is C.

To determine the temperature at which the root mean square (rms) velocity of hydrogen gas (H₂) equals the escape velocity of Earth, we start with the formula for rms velocity:

\[
v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}}
\]

Here:
- \( R = 8.3 \times 10^7 \, \text{erg mol}^{-1} \, \text{K}^{-1} \) (gas constant),
- \( M = 2 \, \text{g mol}^{-1} \) (molar mass of H₂),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin,
- \( v_{\text{rms}} \) is set equal to the escape velocity, \( v_{\text{escape}} = 1.1 \times 10^6 \, \text{cm s}^{-1} \).

Equating \( v_{\text{rms}} \) to \( v_{\text{escape}} \) and solving for \( T \):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}} = 1.1 \times 10^6
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{3RT}{M} = (1.1 \times 10^6)^2
\]

\[
T = \frac{M \cdot v_{\text{escape}}^2}{3R}
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( M = 2 \, \text{g mol}^{-1} \),
- \( v_{\text{escape}}^2 = (1.1 \times 10^6)^2 = 1.21 \times 10^{12} \, \text{cm}^2 \, \text{s}^{-2} \),
- \( R = 8.3 \times 10^7 \, \text{erg mol}^{-1} \, \text{K}^{-1} \),

\[
T = \frac{2 \cdot 1.21 \times 10^{12}}{3 \cdot 8.3 \times 10^7}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
2 \cdot 1.21 \times 10^{12} = 2.42 \times 10^{12} \, \text{erg mol}^{-1}
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
3 \cdot 8.3 \times 10^7 = 2.49 \times 10^8 \, \text{erg mol}^{-1} \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

Now divide:

\[
T = \frac{2.42 \times 10^{12}}{2.49 \times 10^8} = 0.972 \times 10^4 \, \text{K} = 9.72 \times 10^3 \, \text{K}
\]

Comparing this result to the given options, the closest match is:

**C: \( 9.72 \times 10^3 \, \text{K} \)**.

Thus, the temperature at which the rms velocity of H₂ equals the escape velocity is approximately **9.72 × 10³ K**.
