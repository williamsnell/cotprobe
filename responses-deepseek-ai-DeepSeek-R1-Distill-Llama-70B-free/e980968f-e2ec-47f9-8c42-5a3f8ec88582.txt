Question:

A woman owned a four-unit apartment building and lived in one of the units. When one of her tenants vacated his apartment, the woman placed an advertisement in the local paper that read as follows: "Large two-bedroom apartment available for rent. White male preferred." The woman's preference was motivated by the fact that she liked to have a mix of tenants of both genders and from various racial and ethnic backgrounds in her building, and of the remaining rented units, one was rented to an African American man and the other to a Pacific Islander woman. Based upon these facts, which of the following statements is true?

Options:

A: The federal Fair Housing Act doesn't apply to private landlords.
B: Under the federal Fair Housing Act, the woman was not permitted to state a racial or gender preference in the advertisement.
C: The woman's actions are only a violation of state laws, not federal laws.
D: The woman's preference is considered discriminatory only if she refuses to rent to a qualified tenant based on their race or gender.
E: The woman's racial or gender preference is allowed under the federal Fair Housing Act if it promotes diversity.
F: The federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for the woman to refuse to rent her units to prospective tenants because of their race or gender.
G: The woman's motive absolves her from any liability under the federal Fair Housing Act.
H: There are no violations of any federal laws under these facts.
I: The woman's actions are legal under the federal Fair Housing Act as long as she doesn't act on her preference.
J: The woman's actions are legal as long as the apartment is in her primary residence.

Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer for this Fair Housing Act question. Let's start by understanding the scenario. 

So, there's a woman who owns a four-unit apartment building and lives in one of the units. One tenant moved out, so she advertised for a new renter. Her ad said, "Large two-bedroom apartment available for rent. White male preferred." The reason she wanted a white male is because she likes a mix of tenants in terms of gender and race. Currently, she has an African American man and a Pacific Islander woman renting the other two units.

The question is about whether her actions are legal under the Fair Housing Act. The options are A through J, each making a different claim. I remember that the Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, and familial status. So, landlords can't advertise preferences based on these protected characteristics.

Looking at the advertisement, she explicitly stated a preference for a white male. That's a red flag because race and gender are protected categories. Even if her intention was to create a diverse environment, the way she's going about it is problematic. 

Wait, but I think the Act applies to most housing providers, but there are exceptions for owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units. Oh, right! The Fair Housing Act does have an exemption for the rental of a single-family home or a dwelling with four or fewer units, but only when the owner lives in one of the units. Wait, does that mean she's exempt?

Wait, no, the exemption is for when the owner is renting out units in their own residence, but only if they don't use a real estate broker and don't use discriminatory advertising. Oh, because she placed an ad stating a preference, she might lose the exemption. Because the exemption doesn't protect against discriminatory advertising. So even if she's exempt from some provisions, the advertising part might still be a violation.

So the key here is that the Fair Housing Act prohibits discriminatory advertising, regardless of the exemption. So even though she lives in the building and it's a four-unit, by advertising a racial and gender preference, she's violating the law.

Looking at the options:

Option B says that under the Act, she wasn't allowed to state a racial or gender preference in the ad. That sounds correct because the Act prohibits such statements in advertising.

Option F says it's illegal to refuse to rent based on race or gender, which is also correct, but the question is about the advertisement, not refusal.

Option A says the Act doesn't apply to private landlords, but that's wrong because it does apply, especially regarding advertising.

Option E suggests her preference is allowed if promoting diversity, but that's not right because the Act doesn't permit such preferences even for that reason.

Option J says it's legal if the apartment is in her primary residence, but the ad's content might still violate the Act regardless.

So the correct answer should be B.

The correct answer is B. The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from stating racial or gender preferences in advertisements, even if the intent is to promote diversity. The woman's advertisement violates this prohibition.

Answer: B
