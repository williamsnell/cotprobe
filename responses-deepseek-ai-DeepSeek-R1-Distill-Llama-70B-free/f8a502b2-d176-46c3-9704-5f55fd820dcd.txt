Question:

While relaxing at poolside one Sunday afternoon, a homeowner was struck by a golf ball driven by a 14-year-old boy who was playing the ninth hole at the local golf course. The fairway for the ninth hole was 65 feet wide and 437 yards long, with a dogleg in an easterly direction. Between the fairway and the homeowner's property was a "rough," containing brush and low-lying trees. The boy had hit a towering shot down the middle of the fairway that deflected off a tree and struck the homeowner in the head. The homeowner brought suit against the boy for his injuries suffered when he was hit by the golf ball. At trial, the boy offered uncontested evidence that golf balls from the golf course regularly traversed onto the homeowner's property two to three times a day. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the boy's liability for trespass?

Options:

A: The boy is not liable, because he did not intentionally cause the golf ball to traverse onto theplaintiff's property.
B: Because the golf ball did not substantiallyinterfere with the plaintiff's use and enjoymentof his land, the boy would not be held liable.
C: The boy is not liable because the golf course should have better protective measures to prevent golf balls from entering neighboring properties.
D: The boy would be liable only if he was aware that his golf balls regularly traversed onto the homeowner's property.
E: The boy is liable because the frequency of golf balls entering the homeowner's property suggests a lack of care in his play.
F: The boy would be liable for the unpermittedintrusion of the golf ball onto the plaintiff'sproperty.
G: The boy is liable because he was negligent in hitting the golf ball in the direction of the homeowner's property.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically trespass. Let me try to break it down. The scenario is a homeowner being hit by a golf ball struck by a 14-year-old boy. The question is about the boy's liability for trespass.

From what I remember, trespass to land is an intentional tort. The elements are that the defendant intentionally entered (or caused an entry) onto the plaintiff's land without permission, causing damage. So intent is key hereâ€”did the boy mean to hit the ball onto the homeowner's property?

In this case, the boy hit the ball down the middle of the fairway, but it deflected off a tree. That sounds like an accident. He didn't aim at the homeowner's property. So was there intent? Probably not. If he didn't intend for the ball to go there, then trespass might not apply.

Wait, but there's also the idea of "intent" in the sense of the action itself. If he intentionally swung the club, but the ball went elsewhere, that's still within the scope of his action. But I think for trespass, the intent has to be to cause the entry onto the land, not just the action that resulted in it.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the boy isn't liable because he didn't intentionally cause the ball to go onto the property. That seems right because intent is required for trespass.

Option B talks about substantial interference. I think that's more about nuisance, not trespass. Trespass is about the unpermitted entry, regardless of the extent of interference.

Option C suggests the golf course is at fault. But the question is about the boy's liability, not the course's. So that's probably not the answer.

Option D says liability only if he knew his balls regularly went there. But I don't think knowledge is required for trespass; it's about intent at the time of the act.

Option E suggests liability due to lack of care, implying negligence. But trespass is an intentional tort, so negligence wouldn't make him liable for trespass. Unless the trespass was negligent, but I don't think that's a thing. Trespass requires intent.

Option F states he's liable for the intrusion. But without intent, trespass doesn't hold. So F doesn't apply.

Option G says he's liable because he was negligent in hitting towards the property. Again, that's negligence, not intentional trespass. So G is about negligence, which isn't the issue here.

So putting it together, the key is whether the boy intended the ball to go onto the property. Since he hit it down the fairway and it deflected, he didn't intend that outcome. Therefore, A is the correct answer.

The question revolves around whether the 14-year-old boy is liable for trespass after a golf ball he hit deflected onto the homeowner's property. Trespass to land is an intentional tort that requires the defendant to intentionally cause an unpermitted entry onto the plaintiff's land. In this case, the boy hit the ball down the fairway, and it deflected off a tree. There is no evidence that he intended for the ball to enter the homeowner's property, which is a critical element for trespass liability.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** correctly states that the boy is not liable because he did not intentionally cause the ball to traverse onto the plaintiff's property. This aligns with the requirement of intent for trespass.
- **Option B** refers to substantial interference, which pertains to nuisance, not trespass.
- **Option C** shifts liability to the golf course, but the question focuses on the boy's liability.
- **Option D** mentions awareness of golf balls regularly entering the property, but knowledge is not required for trespass; intent at the time of the act is the key factor.
- **Option E** suggests liability based on lack of care, which relates to negligence, not intentional trespass.
- **Option F** claims liability for the intrusion, but trespass requires intent, which is absent here.
- **Option G** focuses on negligence in hitting the ball, which again does not satisfy the intent requirement for trespass.

The boy's action of hitting the ball down the fairway does not demonstrate intent to cause the ball to enter the homeowner's property. Therefore, the most accurate statement is **Option A**.
