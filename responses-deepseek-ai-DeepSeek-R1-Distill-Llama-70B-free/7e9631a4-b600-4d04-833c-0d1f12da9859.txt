Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Hume's attack on natural law. I'm a bit rusty on Hume, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see... The question is asking what the foundation of Hume's argument against natural law is.

First, I remember that David Hume was a Scottish philosopher known for his empiricist approach. He believed that all knowledge comes from experience, right? So he probably had some issues with concepts that aren't based on empirical evidence.

Natural law theories often posit that there's a higher, universal moral law that applies to everyone, regardless of human-made laws. Thinkers like Aquinas or Locke talked about natural law being based on reason or divine order. But Hume was skeptical about such ideas.

I think Hume argued against the idea that there's a universal moral law. He might have pointed out that different cultures have different moral norms, showing that morality isn't universal but rather varies. If that's the case, then natural law, which claims to be universal, can't be real because there's no actual universal agreement on what's morally right or wrong.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says there's no universal agreement on natural law. That sounds familiar because Hume did discuss variations in moral practices across societies. So this could be it.

Option B claims natural law is arbitrary. While that's a possible criticism, I don't recall Hume specifically saying it's arbitrary. He was more about the lack of empirical basis and variability.

Option C says natural law doesn't apply to all cultures. That's similar to A but phrased differently. Hume's point was more about the lack of agreement, which supports A.

Option D mentions natural law being backward-looking. I'm not sure about this. I think Hume talked about the social contract being a fiction, but that's more about political obligation. Not directly about natural law.

Option E is about the social contract. Hume did critique the idea of the social contract, arguing that it's not based on actual consent. But the question is about natural law, so E might not be the answer unless the attack on social contract is part of his argument against natural law.

Option F says we can't objectively know right or wrong. That sounds more like moral relativism or Hume's distinction between facts and values. He said you can't derive 'ought' from 'is'. But is that the basis of his attack on natural law? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option G calls natural law outdated. I don't think Hume's argument was about being outdated, more about its empirical grounding.

Option H states natural law isn't based on empirical evidence. That rings a bell. Since Hume was an empiricist, he'd argue that concepts must be grounded in experience. Natural law, being a supposed universal, isn't observable, so Hume would attack it for lacking empirical support.

Wait, so now I'm torn between A and H. Because Hume's empiricism would lead him to say natural law isn't based on evidence, and also, he points out that moral practices vary, so there's no universal agreement.

Which one is the foundation of his attack? I think the key here is that Hume's main critique was that natural law isn't empirically verifiable. He might have used the variation in moral practices as evidence for that. So the primary argument is that natural law lacks empirical basis.

But another thought: Hume's argument against natural law is often that it's not based on empirical evidence and that it's a metaphysical concept. So Option H would be correct. But wait, I also remember Hume's Is-Ought problem, where he says you can't derive ought from is. That's more about the logical separation of facts and values, which is a different point.

Alternatively, in his Treatise, Hume discusses how our sense of morality comes from sentiment, not reason. So he might argue that natural law, which is supposed to be based on reason, is incorrect. But that's more about the source of morality rather than the attack on natural law specifically.

Wait, the question is about Hume's attack on natural law. So perhaps the main point is that natural law isn't based on empirical evidence. So Option H: Natural law is not based on empirical evidence.

But I'm a bit confused because another angle is that there's no universal agreement, which is Option A. Hume definitely pointed out that different societies have different moral norms, which undermines the idea of a universal natural law. So he uses that as evidence that natural law isn't real.

So which is more fundamental? The lack of empirical basis or the lack of universality? I think the foundation is the empirical argument. Because without empirical evidence, you can't have a basis for natural law. The variation across cultures is evidence supporting that natural law isn't real because it's not based on observable, universal facts.

Wait, but Hume's main point in his critique might be that natural law isn't based on empirical evidence. So Option H would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, if the question is about the attack's foundation, it's the lack of empirical basis.

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky. Let me think again. Hume's empiricism leads him to dismiss concepts that aren't grounded in experience. Natural law is a metaphysical concept, so Hume would reject it for lacking empirical support. So the answer should be H.

But wait, another angle: in his Enquiry, Hume talks about the social contract being a fiction, but that's a separate issue. The question is about natural law.

So I'm going to go with H: Natural law is not based on empirical evidence.

Hume's attack on natural law is rooted in his empiricist philosophy, which holds that all knowledge must be derived from experience and observation. Natural law, often posited as a universal and higher moral law, lacks an empirical basis and cannot be verified through experience. Hume emphasizes that concepts like natural law are metaphysical and not grounded in observable reality. While he also notes the variability of moral practices across cultures, which undermines the universality of natural law, his primary critique is that natural law is not based on empirical evidence. This makes Option H the most accurate representation of the foundation of his argument.

Answer: H
