Okay, so I've got this question about factor groups, and I'm a bit rusty on my group theory, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking for the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15) / ⟨⟨1, 1⟩⟩. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that the order of a factor group G/H is equal to the order of G divided by the order of H. So I need to find the order of Z_11 x Z_15 and then divide it by the order of the subgroup ⟨⟨1, 1⟩⟩.

Let me start by recalling that Z_n denotes the cyclic group of integers modulo n under addition. So the direct product Z_11 x Z_15 would consist of all ordered pairs where the first element is from Z_11 and the second from Z_15. The order of this direct product is the product of the orders of each group, so 11 * 15 = 165. So the group G has 165 elements.

Now, the subgroup H is ⟨⟨1, 1⟩⟩, which is the cyclic subgroup generated by the element (1,1) in Z_11 x Z_15. To find the order of this subgroup, I need to find the smallest positive integer m such that m*(1,1) = (0,0) in Z_11 x Z_15. 

In additive notation, this means (m*1 mod 11, m*1 mod 15) should be (0,0). So I'm looking for the smallest m where m ≡ 0 mod 11 and m ≡ 0 mod 15. That means m must be the least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 15. 

Calculating the LCM of 11 and 15: since 11 is prime and 15 is 3*5, their LCM is 11*15 = 165. So the order of the subgroup H is 165.

Wait, but that can't be right because if H has the same order as G, then the factor group G/H would have order 165 / 165 = 1. But looking at the options, option A is 1, which would make sense if that's the case. But intuitively, that feels a bit strange because ⟨⟨1, 1⟩⟩ being the entire group would mean that the factor group is trivial, which is possible.

But wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in finding the order of H. Let me double-check. The element (1,1) in Z_11 x Z_15: when you add it m times, you get (m mod 11, m mod 15). For both components to be zero, m must be a multiple of both 11 and 15, so the smallest such m is indeed 165. So H is the entire group, hence the factor group has only the identity element, so order 1.

But wait, I'm confused because sometimes the notation can be tricky. Let me think again. The subgroup generated by (1,1) in Z_11 x Z_15 would consist of all elements (k, k) where k is an integer. The order of this element is the LCM of the orders of 1 in Z_11 and 1 in Z_15. The order of 1 in Z_11 is 11, since 11*1 ≡ 0 mod 11, and similarly the order of 1 in Z_15 is 15. So the order of (1,1) is LCM(11,15) = 165, which matches what I had before.

So then, the subgroup H has order 165, same as G, so G/H would have order 1. So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake because sometimes the cyclic subgroup generated by (1,1) might not necessarily require m to be the LCM. Let me consider an example with smaller numbers to check. For instance, take Z_2 x Z_2. The element (1,1) would have order 2 because 2*(1,1)=(0,0). So in that case, the subgroup is of order 2, but the group itself is order 4, so the factor group has order 2. So in that example, the order of (1,1) is 2, which is the LCM of 2 and 2, which is 2, correct.

Wait, but in the case of Z_11 x Z_15, the element (1,1) would have order LCM(11,15)=165, which is the same as the order of the group. So the subgroup is the entire group, hence the factor group is trivial with order 1.

So the answer should be A:1.

But wait, let me see the options again. Option A is 1, which makes sense. So I think I'm confident now.

To determine the order of the factor group \((\mathbb{Z}_{11} \times \mathbb{Z}_{15}) / \langle (1,1) \rangle\), we proceed as follows:

1. **Order of \(G = \mathbb{Z}_{11} \times \mathbb{Z}_{15}\):**  
   The group \(\mathbb{Z}_{11} \times \mathbb{Z}_{15}\) is the direct product of two cyclic groups. The order of this group is the product of the orders of the individual groups:  
   \[
   |G| = |\mathbb{Z}_{11}| \cdot |\mathbb{Z}_{15}| = 11 \cdot 15 = 165.
   \]

2. **Order of the subgroup \(H = \langle (1,1) \rangle\):**  
   The subgroup \(H\) is generated by the element \((1,1)\). To find the order of \(H\), we need the smallest positive integer \(m\) such that:  
   \[
   m \cdot (1,1) = (0,0) \text{ in } \mathbb{Z}_{11} \times \mathbb{Z}_{15}.
   \]  
   This means:  
   \[
   m \cdot 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{11} \quad \text{and} \quad m \cdot 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{15}.
   \]  
   The smallest such \(m\) is the least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 15. Since 11 is prime and 15 factors as \(3 \cdot 5\), their LCM is:  
   \[
   \text{LCM}(11, 15) = 11 \cdot 15 = 165.
   \]  
   Therefore, the order of \(H\) is 165.

3. **Order of the factor group \(G/H\):**  
   The order of the factor group \(G/H\) is given by:  
   \[
   |G/H| = \frac{|G|}{|H|} = \frac{165}{165} = 1.
   \]  

Thus, the factor group \((\mathbb{Z}_{11} \times \mathbb{Z}_{15}) / \langle (1,1) \rangle\) has order 1. The correct answer is:

**A: 1**
