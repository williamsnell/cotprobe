Okay, so I've got this biology question here about sea urchin oocytes and the process of preventing polyspermy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me think it through.

The question says that when there's a rise in intracellular free calcium in the oocyte, proteolytic enzymes are released to prevent polyspermy. I remember that polyspermy is when more than one sperm fertilizes an egg, which is not good because it can lead to abnormal development. So the egg must have mechanisms to prevent this.

I think about the steps that happen during fertilization. When a sperm approaches the egg, it has to go through several layers. The main ones I remember are the zona pellucida and the cell membrane. Oh wait, but in sea urchins, the structure might be a bit different. I think the egg has a jelly coat and then the cell membrane, but maybe no zona like mammals do.

When the sperm touches the egg's cell membrane, it causes a reaction in the egg. One of the things that happens is an increase in calcium ions inside the egg. This calcium release is a key trigger for several events. One of these is the exocytosis of cortical granules. These granules contain enzymes and other molecules that modify the egg's outer layers to prevent other sperm from entering.

So the release of these enzymes would be part of what's called the cortical reaction. The term "cortical" refers to the cortex, the outer layer of the egg. When these granules release their contents, the egg's structure changes, making it impenetrable to additional sperm. This process is crucial to ensure monospermy, meaning only one sperm fertilizes the egg.

Looking at the options now. The question is asking what the events described entail. The events are the calcium rise leading to proteolytic enzymes being released to prevent polyspermy.

Option A is polyspermy reaction, which doesn't make sense because the event is preventing polyspermy, not causing it. Option B is enzymatic reaction, which is a bit vague but possible. Option C is proteolytic reaction, which is more specific. Since proteolytic enzymes are involved, maybe that's a contender. Option D is acrosomal reaction, which I think is when the sperm releases its own enzymes, so that's a different process. Option E is oocyte reaction, which is too broad. Option F is fertilization reaction, maybe part of it, but not specific. Option G is calcium reaction, which is about the cause but not the effect. Option H is cortical reaction, which I think is correct because that's the term I remember for this process. Option I is zona reaction, which might refer to changes in the zona pellucida, but sea urchins might not have that. Option J is intracellular reaction, which is true but not specific enough.

Wait, so the process described is the release of enzymes from the cortical granules, which is the cortical reaction. So the correct answer should be H: cortical reaction.

The question describes a process in sea urchin oocytes where a rise in intracellular free calcium triggers the release of proteolytic enzymes to prevent polyspermy. This mechanism is part of the cortical reaction, a specific event during fertilization where cortical granules release their contents to modify the egg's outer layers, ensuring monospermy. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Polyspermy reaction** refers to the phenomenon of multiple sperm fertilizing the egg, which is the opposite of what is described.
- **B: Enzymatic reaction** and **C: Proteolytic reaction** are relevant but lack specificity.
- **D: Acrosomal reaction** describes a sperm-related process, not the egg's response.
- **E: Oocyte reaction** and **F: Fertilization reaction** are too broad.
- **G: Calcium reaction** focuses on the cause (calcium rise) rather than the effect.
- **H: Cortical reaction** accurately describes the process involving the release of enzymes from cortical granules.
- **I: Zona reaction** refers to changes in the zona pellucida, which is not relevant to sea urchins.
- **J: Intracellular reaction** is too general.

The most precise answer is **H: Cortical reaction**, as it directly describes the event where proteolytic enzymes are released to prevent polyspermy.

Answer: H
