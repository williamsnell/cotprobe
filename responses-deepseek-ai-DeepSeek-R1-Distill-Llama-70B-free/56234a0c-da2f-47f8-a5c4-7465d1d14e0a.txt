Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"When we were kids the United States was the wealthiest and strongest country in the world; the only one with the atom bomb, the least scarred by modern war, an initiator of the United Nations that we thought would distribute Western influence throughout the world. Freedom and equality for each individual, government of, by, and for the people—these American values we found good, principles by which we could live as men. Many of us began maturing in complacency.
"As we grew, however, our comfort was penetrated by events too troubling to dismiss. First, the permeating and victimizing fact of human degradation, symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry, compelled most of us from silence to activism. Second, the enclosing fact of the Cold War, symbolized by the presence of the Bomb, brought awareness that we ourselves, and our friends, and millions of abstract 'others' we knew more directly because of our common peril, might die at any time. . . ."

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about the Port Huron Statement and the growth of the organization that published it through the 1960s. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the Port Huron Statement was written in 1962 by Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), which was a student-led activist organization in the United States. The statement itself talks about the ideals of American democracy and the challenges the country was facing, like racial inequality and the Cold War.

The question is asking about the context in which SDS grew throughout the 1960s. So I need to think about the key events and social movements during that decade that influenced student activism.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Increase in immigration, labor unions, feminist movement. The feminist movement did start gaining momentum in the late 60s, but labor unions were more prominent earlier. Immigration might have been a factor, but I'm not sure how directly it ties to SDS's growth.

Option B: Baby boom, economic growth, expansion of higher education. The baby boom would mean more young people, and higher education expansion definitely led to more students, which could fuel student movements. Economic growth might have provided resources, but I'm not certain this is the primary context.

Option C: Computers, Christian fundamentalism, student apathy. The 60s were more about activism than apathy. Computers weren't really a thing yet in the 60s. Christian fundamentalism might have been around but not a major factor in SDS.

Option D: Vietnam War escalation, peace movement, assassinations. The Vietnam War definitely escalated in the mid to late 60s. The peace movement grew as a response, and SDS was involved in anti-war protests. Assassinations like JFK, MLK, and RFK were significant events that could radicalize students.

Option E: Economic polarization, supply-side policies, middle class disappearance. This sounds more like 80s or 90s issues, especially with supply-side economics under Reagan. The 60s were more about the Great Society and welfare programs.

Option F: Decline of colonial powers, new nations, spread of democracy. This is more about global decolonization, which was ongoing, but how does that directly tie to SDS's growth in the US? Maybe through opposition to imperialism, but not the main factors.

Option G: New tech, internet, multinationals. Internet wasn't around in the 60s, so this is out. New technologies and multinationals were emerging but not the main context.

Option H: Civil rights, spread of communism, nuclear threat. The civil rights movement was big in the early 60s. The spread of communism and nuclear threat were Cold War issues, which were mentioned in the Port Huron Statement. But SDS's growth was also influenced by other factors.

Option I: End of Cold War, Soviet dissolution, globalization. These events happened in the 90s, so not relevant for the 60s.

Option J: Rapid industrialization, urban growth, corporate consolidation. This seems more related to earlier periods, like the Gilded Age or maybe the 20s-30s.

So, narrowing it down. The Port Huron Statement was in 1962, and SDS's growth through the 60s. The statement mentions the Cold War and civil rights, but the main growth factors were probably the Vietnam War and the peace movement. Also, the civil rights movement was a big part of the 60s, but the question is about the organization's growth, which I think was more driven by the anti-war movement as the decade progressed.

Looking again, option D includes the escalation of the Vietnam War, the growth of the peace movement, and assassinations. These events definitely impacted student activism. SDS became a major player in the anti-war movement, organizing protests and teach-ins. The assassinations also contributed to a sense of crisis and urgency among activists.

Option B is about demographics and education, which is important because more students meant a larger base for SDS. But the question is about the context of the growth, which I think is more about the events that motivated them rather than just the number of students.

So I'm leaning towards option D. The Vietnam War's escalation, the growing peace movement, and the impact of assassinations would have driven SDS's expansion as more students became involved in activism.

The Port Huron Statement, published in 1962 by Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), reflected the ideals of American democracy while addressing challenges like racial inequality and the Cold War. The question asks about the context for SDS's growth throughout the 1960s. 

Key factors influencing SDS's growth include the escalation of the Vietnam War, which galvanized the anti-war movement, and the assassinations of key political figures, which heightened a sense of crisis and urgency among activists. These events align with the growth of the peace movement, making Option D the most relevant context for SDS's expansion during the decade.

Answer: D
