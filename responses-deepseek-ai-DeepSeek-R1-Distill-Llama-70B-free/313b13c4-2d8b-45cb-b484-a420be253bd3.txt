Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let's see what I can do. The question is about symbolizing a sentence into a logical formula, and I need to pick the correct one from the options given. 

The sentence is: "If either George enrolls or Harry enrolls, then Ira does not enroll." Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the sentence. It's a conditional statement, right? The "if... then..." structure. So in logic terms, conditionals are usually represented as P → Q, where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent.

So the antecedent here is "either George enrolls or Harry enrolls." In symbols, that would be G ∨ H, where G is George enrolls and H is Harry enrolls. The consequent is "Ira does not enroll," which is ~I, with I being Ira enrolls.

Putting that together, the sentence should be (G ∨ H) → ~I. Now I need to look through the options to find which one matches this structure.

Let me look at the options again:

Option A: (G ∨ H) ∨ ~I — Wait, that's a disjunction, not a conditional. So it's saying either G or H is true, or I is not true. That doesn't capture the "if-then" relationship. So A is not right.

Option B: (G ⊃ H) ∨ ~I — This is saying if G then H, or I is not true. That doesn't fit our original sentence because the antecedent should be G∨H, not G→H. So B is out.

Option C: (G ⊃ ~H) ∨ I — This seems off. It's saying if G then not H, or I is true. Doesn't match the structure we need. So C is incorrect.

Option D: (G ∨ H) ∨ I — Again, a disjunction. It's saying either G or H or I is true. But the original sentence is about if G or H, then not I. So D isn't it.

Option E: (G ⊃ H) ∨ I — Again, G implies H, or I. Not what we need. E is incorrect.

Option F: (G ∨ I) ⊃ ~H — Hmm, this is saying if G or I, then not H. That's not our sentence. Our sentence is about G or H leading to not I. So F is wrong.

Option G: (G ∨ H) ⊃ ~I — Wait, this looks exactly like what we derived. So G is the correct option.

But let me check the other options just to be sure.

Option H: (G ⊃ I) ∨ H — This is if G then I, or H. Doesn't fit. H is incorrect.

Option I: (G ∨ H) ⊃ I — Oh, wait, this is the opposite of what we want. It says if G or H, then I. But our original sentence says Ira does not enroll, so it should be ~I, not I. So I is wrong.

Option J: (G ∨ ~H) ⊃ I — This is if G or not H, then I. Again, not matching. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be option G.

The sentence "If either George enrolls or Harry enrolls, then Ira does not enroll" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this is represented as **(G ∨ H) → ~I**, where:

- **G**: George enrolls  
- **H**: Harry enrolls  
- **I**: Ira enrolls  

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: (G ∨ H) ∨ ~I — Incorrect, as it represents a disjunction, not a conditional.  
- **B**: (G ⊃ H) ∨ ~I — Incorrect, as it misrepresents the antecedent.  
- **C**: (G ⊃ ~H) ∨ I — Incorrect, as it does not match the structure.  
- **D**: (G ∨ H) ∨ I — Incorrect, as it is a disjunction, not a conditional.  
- **E**: (G ⊃ H) ∨ I — Incorrect, as it does not match the structure.  
- **F**: (G ∨ I) ⊃ ~H — Incorrect, as it misrepresents the relationship.  
- **G**: (G ∨ H) ⊃ ~I — Correct, as it matches the derived formula.  
- **H**: (G ⊃ I) ∨ H — Incorrect, as it does not match the structure.  
- **I**: (G ∨ H) ⊃ I — Incorrect, as it states the opposite of the original sentence.  
- **J**: (G ∨ ~H) ⊃ I — Incorrect, as it does not match the structure.  

The correct answer is **G**.

G
