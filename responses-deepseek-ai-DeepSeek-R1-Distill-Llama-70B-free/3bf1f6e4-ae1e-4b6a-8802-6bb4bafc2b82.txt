Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which statement best describes one of Dworkin's central arguments in his book *Justice for Hedgehogs*. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that Ronald Dworkin was a legal philosopher, so his work must be about the relationship between law and morality. I think he had some specific views on how these two areas interact.

From what I've read before, Dworkin argued that law is not just about rules but also about principles. He believed that judges, when deciding cases, especially hard ones, use moral principles to guide their decisions. So, this suggests that morality does play a role in the legal system.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the law is the only guide for ethical behavior. That doesn't sound right because Dworkin probably acknowledges that ethics come from other places too, not just law.

Option B states that the law dictates what moral values affect ethical behavior. Hmm, I'm not sure. I think Dworkin might say that law incorporates morality but maybe the law doesn't dictate it; rather, moral values influence the law.

Option C claims morality plays no role in law, which contradicts what I remember. Dworkin definitely thought morality is involved, especially in hard cases.

Option D says moral arguments operate only in hard cases. Wait, I thought Dworkin said that in hard cases (where the law isn't clear), judges use moral principles, but maybe he didn't limit morality to just those cases. Maybe he thought it's a more general part of the law.

Option E suggests morality applies only to specific, complex cases. That seems similar to D, but I'm not sure that's accurate. I think Dworkin's view was broader.

Option F: Legal principles shouldn't be influenced by moral values. No, that's the opposite of what I remember. Dworkin believed that moral values do influence legal principles.

Option G: Moral values are both independent and objective. I'm not certain, but I think Dworkin did argue for objective moral values. Wait, in *Justice for Hedgehogs*, he talks about moral realism, I believe. So he would say that moral values are objective, not just subjective.

Option H: Law and morality are entirely separate. No, because he argues they do overlap and influence each other.

Option I: Morality is subjective and changes over time. That contradicts G. If he argued for objective values, then I would be incorrect.

Option J: Ethical behavior is independent of moral values. That doesn't make sense because ethical behavior is based on moral values.

So, narrowing down, the key points are:

- Dworkin believes that morality plays a role in law, especially in hard cases where judges must make decisions beyond just applying rules.
- He argues for objective moral values, meaning they're not just subjective or based on individual opinions.

Looking back at the options, Option G says "Moral values are both independent and objective." That fits because Dworkin would argue that moral values exist independently (they're not just made up by people) and are objective truths.

Another point to consider: Dworkin's theory of law as integrity includes the idea that the law is structured by moral principles. So, the law incorporates morality, and morality isn't just a personal thing but has an objective basis.

Therefore, the best answer should be Option G.

The correct answer is:

G: Moral values are both independent and objective.
