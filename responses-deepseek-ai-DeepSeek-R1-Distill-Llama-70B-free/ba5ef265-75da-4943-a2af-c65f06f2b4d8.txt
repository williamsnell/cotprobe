Okay, so I've got this economics question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about income elasticity of demand for real money and how it relates to the growth rate of real income. 

Alright, I remember that income elasticity of demand is a measure of how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in income. The formula for income elasticity, if I recall correctly, is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income. So, elasticity (e) = (% change in Qd) / (% change in Y).

Wait, the question gives the income elasticity as 0.8. And it says that the demand for real money is increasing at a rate of 2.6% per year. So, I think this means that the quantity demanded of real money is growing by 2.6% annually. 

So, we can plug these into the formula. Let me write that down. We have e = 0.8, and the % change in Qd is 2.6%. We're looking for the % change in income, which is the growth rate of real income, let's call it g.

Rearranging the formula, the percentage change in income (g) would be equal to the percentage change in Qd divided by elasticity. So, g = (2.6%) / 0.8. Let me calculate that. 

2.6 divided by 0.8 is... let's see, 0.8 times 3 is 2.4, which leaves 0.2. 0.2 divided by 0.8 is 0.25, so 3.25. So, 3.25%.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculation. 2.6 / 0.8 = 3.25? Let me compute it more accurately. 0.8 * 3 = 2.4, subtract from 2.6 gives 0.2. 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25. So yes, 3.25. So the growth rate of real income would be 3.25% per year. 

Looking back at the options, option E is 3.25% per year. So that's the answer.

To determine the growth rate of real income, we use the concept of income elasticity of demand. The formula for income elasticity (e) is:

\[
e = \frac{\% \text{ change in quantity demanded}}{\% \text{ change in income}}
\]

Rearranging the formula to solve for the percentage change in income (growth rate of real income, \( g \)):

\[
g = \frac{\% \text{ change in quantity demanded}}{e}
\]

Given:
- Income elasticity (\( e \)) = 0.8
- Percentage change in quantity demanded = 2.6%

Substituting the values:

\[
g = \frac{2.6}{0.8} = 3.25\%
\]

Thus, the growth rate of real income is **3.25% per year**. The correct answer is:

**E: 3.25% Per year**
